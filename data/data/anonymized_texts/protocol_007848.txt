2/Protocol GA28950, Version 8PROTOCOL A MENDMENT, VERSION 8:
RATIONA LE
Protocol GA28950 has primarily been amended to reflect changes in efficacy endpoi nts. 
Thechanges will not impact study conduct at the site level. These changes are as 
follows:
The primary efficacy endpoint for the Maintenance Phase has been changed to 
remission at Week 66 for patients who achieve clinical response (rather than 
remission) at W eek 14.  This change has been made to align with clinical practice 
standards whereby patients who experience a clinical response during treatment 
induction continue on treatment and are assessed for remission at a later time point
(Sections 2.1, 3.4.1, 6.1, 6.4 and 6.4.1, Figure 1 andFigure 3 ).
To assess the onset of action of etrolizumab , a secondary efficacy endpoint of
change in Mayo Clinic Score (MCS) rectal bleeding and stool frequency subscores 
from baseline to Week 6 has been added (Sections 2.1, 3.4.1, and 6.4.2) .
Secondary and exploratory efficacy endpoints have been amended to align with the 
revision of the primary efficacy endpoint (Sections 2.1, 3.4.1 and 6.4.2).
Histologic remission, defined as a Nancy histological index of 1, has been added 
as a secondary efficacy outcome measure. The definition is based on consensus 
guidelines recommending that histologic remission should be defined by the 
absence of neutrophils in the crypts and lamina propria (Section 2.1, 3.4.1, 6.4.2 
Appendix 12 and Table 1).
The study sample size has been reduced from 800 to 605patients as a result of the 
change in the Maintenance Phase primary efficacy endpoint , which will be powered 
at >90%. The Induction Phase primary efficacy endpoint definition (proportion of 
patients in remission at W eek 14) will remain unchanged ,but the reduction in 
sample size will lead to a drop in power from >90% to 80% (Sections 3.1.1, 6.1, 9.4, 
and Figure 1 ).
Janus kinase inhibitors have been added to the list of rescue therapies prohibited at 
any time during the study (Sections 3.1.1.2, 4.3.2.2, and 4.4.2).
Exclusion criteria have been amended to include any treatment with tofacitinib 
during screening as this drug has been approved for use in the United States and is 
no longer an investigational product (Section 4.1.2).
The exclusion criterion related to eligibility following receipt of investigational 
treatments has been modified to account for current molecules in development for 
the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease.  The allowable time period after 
treatment has been reduced to 5 half -lives of the investigational product or 28 days 
after the last dose, (whichever is greater) prior to Day 1 of the study (Section 4.1.2).
Etrolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd
3/Protocol GA28950, Version 8Derivation of the MCS endoscopic subscore at post -baseline timepoints has been 
amended to be consistent with emerging nor mative standards of endoscopic 
assessment in clinical trials (Sandborn etal.2017).  The sigmoid colon MCS 
endoscopic subscore will be used (rather than the score from the worst affected 
segment, i.e., rectum, sigmoid colon, or descending colon) if the ba seline sigmoid 
colon MCS endoscopic subscore is 2 3.The sigmoid colon MCS endoscopic 
subscore is considered to be more reliable in assessing earlier treatment response 
(Section 4.6.1.4and Appendix 3 ).
Histologic activity on colon biopsies will be measured using the Nancy histological 
index instead of the Geboes scale .  The Geboes scale was designed to characterize 
all types of mucosal inflammation related to ulcerative colitis but was not designed 
to easily compare differences in histologic activit y over time in th e context of a 
clinical trial.  On the other hand, the Nancy histological index was developed and 
validated to capture meaningful changes in key histologic features of ulcerative 
colitis andcan be easily applied in a clinical trial settin g(Section s4.6.1.5 and 
Appendix 12 ).
Language regarding local injection -site reactions has been clarified in Table 5, 
"Guidelines for Managing Specific Adverse Events" (Section 5.1.2) .
Procedures for adverse event reporting have been updated to clarify th at adverse 
event reports will not be derived from patient -reported outcome (PRO) data and 
safety analyses will not be performed using PRO data.  Sites are not expected to 
review the PRO data for adverse events ( Section 5.3.5.12).
Language has been add to Section 6.1 to clarify that f or the purpose of statistical 
analyses and sample size calculations , the Induction and Maintenance Phases will 
be treated as two independent studies , and as such ,no adjustment to alpha is 
required.
Additional minor changes have been made to improve clarity and consistency. 
Substantive new information appears in italics. This amendment represents cumulative 
changes to the original p rotocol.

Study Design
Description of Study
This is a multicenter, Phase III, double- blind, placebo -controlled study evaluating the safety, 
efficacy , and tolerability of etrolizumab during induction and maintenance of remission 
compared with placebo in the treatment of moderately to severely active UC.
Patients enrolled in this study may be eligi ble to participate in an open- label extension and 
safety monitoring (OLE -SM) study (GA28951), which consists of two parts: Part 1 (designated 
OLE [open -label extension]) and Part 2 (designated SM [safety monitoring]).
Disease severity will be measured us ing the MCS (see protocol), which is the current outcome 
measure accepted by regulatory authorities for drug development in UC.  The target population 
is patients with moderately to severely active UC (defined as MCS of 612, endoscopy 
subscore of 2 as d etermined by the central read ing procedure described in the protocol, a 
rectal bleeding subscore  1, and a stool frequency subscore of 1),and involvement that 
extends a minimum of 20 cm from the anal verge.
Patients who are on background immunosuppressant therapy (6 -mercaptopurine [ MP], 
azathioprine [ AZA], methotrexate [ MTX ]) may be enrolled if they have received a stable dose for 
at least 8 weeks prior to Day 1.  Such patients should continue on stable doses of their 
backgr ound immunosuppressant therapy during the study unless dose reduction or 
discontinuation is required due to toxicity.   
Generally accepted criteria for discontinuation of immunosuppressants due to toxicity include 
but are not limited to acute pancreatitis, severe leukopenia, severe thrombocy topenia, or 
clinically significant elevations of the liver -associated enzy mes from baseline especially in the 
presence of an elevated total bilirubin.  The ultimate decision to reduce dose or discontinue 
immunosuppressan ts due to toxicity remains at the discretion of the investigator.
Patients on o ral corticosteroid therapy (prednisone at a stable dose of 30 mg, or equivalent) 
may be enrolled according to the following criteria:
If corticosteroid therapy is ongoing or has recently been initiated, the dose has to be stable 
for at least 4 weeks immediately prior to Day 1
If corti costeroids are being tapered, the dose has to be stable for at least 2weeks 
immediately prior to Day 1 
Etrolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd
15/Protocol GA28950, Version 8Such patients should continue stable dos es of their background corticosteroid until W eek14, at 
which point a corticosteroid taper will be initiated. 
Initiation of corticosteroid or an increase in corticosteroid dose above the patients’ entry dose 
(up to a maximum of 30 mg/day prednisone [or eq uivalent]) will not be permitted during 
screening.  Use of budesonide will be allowed at stable doses ( 9 mg) if the dose has been 
stable for 4 weeks prior to Day 1.  Oral 5- aminosalicylate ( ASA)treatment and probiotics for 
the treatment of UC may  be continued at a stable dose as long as the dose(s) had been stable 
for 4 weeks and 2weeks, respectively, prior to Day 1.  Certain concomitant treatments are 
prohibited (see protocol for list of all prohibited concomitant treatments).  Patients must have
discontinued TNF inhibitor treatment and topical treatments for UC at least 8 weeks and 
2weeks prior to Day 1, respectively.
The study will be divided into:
Screening period of up to 35 days during which patient eligibility will be determined 
Induction Phase of 14 weeks (Cohort 1: open- label etrolizumab treatment; 
Cohort 2:randomized to etrolizumab or placebo)
Randomization of etrolizumab responders prior to a double -blind Maintenance Phase of 
52weeks or continued blinded treatment with placebo Q4 W for52 weeks for placebo 
induction responders 
Safety follow -up period of 12 weeks
A total of approximately 605patients will be recruited from approximately 225sites via an 
open- label induction arm (Cohort 1, n 130) and a double -blind induction arm (Cohort 2, 
n475), which will be enrolled sequentially.
Cohort 1 patients will receive open -label etrolizumab 105 mg SC Q4W  during the 14 -week 
Induction Phase.  Cohort 2 patients will be randomized in a 4:1 ratio to 105 mg etrolizumab SC 
Q4W (n≈380) orplacebo (n ≈95) during the 14 -week Induction Phase.  Randomization will be 
stratified by concomitant treatment with corticosteroids (including budesonide) (yes/no), 
concomitant treatment with immunosuppressants (yes/no), and disease activity measured 
during screening (MCS 9/MCS 10).
Eligibility for entry into the Maintenance Phase will be determined between W eeks 14 and 16.  
Patients in the etrolizumab arm of Cohort 2 who achieved a clinical response at W eek 14 
(see protocol for definition of clinical response) and all Week14 clinical responders in Cohort 1 
will be randomized into the Maintenance Phase and will receive either etrolizumab (105 mg SC
Q4W) or placebo in a 1:1 ratio.  Randomization will be stratified by remission status at Week 14, 
concom itant treatment with corticosteroids (including budesonide) at baseline, disease activity 
measured during screening (MCS 9/MCS 10), and induction cohort (Cohort 1/Cohort 2).  It is 
estimated that the planned approximately 510 etrolizumab patients from Cohort 1 and Cohort 2 
will provide approximately 154patients in clinical response for randomization into the 
Maintenance Phase.  Additional patients may  be enrolled into Cohort 1, if needed, to achieve a 
sufficient number of pati ents in the Maintenance Phase .
Patients initially randomized to placebo will also be assessed for clinical response at W eek14.  
Patients achieving a clinical response will continue to receive blinded placebo during the 
Maintenance Phase of the study.  Patients in either Cohort 1 or Cohort 2, who do not achieve 
clinical response at W eek 14,patients who have clinical relapse during the Maintenance Phase, 
patients who receive defined rescue treatment, and patients who complete 66 weeks of the 
study may be given the option of enrolling into Part 1 (OLE) of Study GA28951, where they will 
receive open -label etrolizumab treatment, ifeligible.  If patients choose not to enroll in 
Part 1(OLE) of Study GA28951, they will enter the 12 -week safety  follow -up period o f thisstudy
and then will be requested to enroll in Part 2 (SM) of Study GA28951 for 92 weeks of extended 
PML monitoring.
Study Drug A dministration
The first twodoses of study medication will be administered via a prefilled syringe (PFS) by a 
health care professional (HCP) in the clinic.  The subsequent two doses will be 
self-administered by the patient or his or her caregiver in the clinic; if deemed appropriate by the 
HCP, the remaining doses of study drug, starting at W eek 16, will be self -administered by the 
Etrolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd
16/Protocol GA28950, Version 8patient or administered by his or her caregiver at home Q4 W (action to be taken as a result of a 
hypersensitivity reaction is provided in the protocol).  The administration of the study medication 
at home by the patients or their caregivers will occur after their study assessments in the clinic 
setting.  If necessary, patients or their HCPs may  choose to continue administration of study 
medication in the cl inic.  The details of study medication administration are provided in the 
protocol.
Oral Corticosteroids during the Study
During the Induction Phase, patients are to maintain their stable baseline corticosteroid dose.  
Corticosteroids are to be tapered starting from Week 14 for patients entering the Maintenance 
Phase.  Patients receiving prednisone at a dose of 10 mg/day (o r equivalent) are to have their 
dose reduced at a rate of 5 mg per week until a 10 mg/day dose is achieved.  Patients receiving 
prednisone at doses  10mg/day (or equivalent), or once a 10 mg/day dose (or equivalent) is 
achieved by tapering, are to have their dose reduced at a rate of 2.5 mg/week until 
discontinuation.  Beginning at Week 14, patients receiving budesonide who achieve clinical 
response at Week 14 should taper their dose of 9 mg every day to 9 mg every other day for 
2weeks and then discontin ue budesonide treatment.  For patients who cannot tolerate the 
corticosteroid taper without recurrence of clinical s ymptoms of either UC or cortico steroid 
withdrawal, corticosteroid dose may  be increased (up to the dose at study entr y if required), but 
tapering must begin again within 2 weeks.
Immunosuppressants during the Study
Patients should continue stable doses of immunosuppressants throughout the study.
Patients should remain on their stable baseline doses of immunosuppressants (AZA, 6 -MP, 
MTX) throug hout the study unless dose reduction or discontinuation is required because of a 
toxicity related to the medication.  Generally accepted criteria for discontinuation of 
immunosuppressants due to toxicity include but are not limited to acute pancreatitis, s evere 
leukopenia, severe thrombocytopenia, or clinically significant elevations of the liver associated 
enzy mes from baseline, especially in the presence of an elevated total bilirubin.  The ultimate 
decision to reduce dose or discontinue immunosuppressant s due to toxicity remains at the 
discretion of the investigator.
Clinical relapse is defined as an:
Increase in partial Mayo Clinic Score (pMCS) 3 points compared to induction timepoint  
(Week 14) AND absolute pMCS  5 AND endoscopic subscore 2
If a p atient meets criteria for clinical relapse during the Maintenance Phase of the study, he or 
she may  withdraw from this study and enroll in Part 1 (OLE) of Study GA28951 if eligible .
Rescue Therapy That Can be Given with Study Medication for the Treatment o f UC
During the Induction Phase (prior to W eek 14)
Patients are required to maintain stable doses of their concomitant medications (oral 
5-aminosalicylate [5 -ASA], corticosteroids, immunosuppressants) for UC.
In the Induction Phase, any patient who requires initiation of an immunosuppressant (AZA, 
6-MP, or MTX), oral or topical 5 -ASA, or corticosteroid, or increase in dose over baseline levels 
for treatment of worsening disease s ymptoms, should stay in the stud y until W eek14, at which 
time the patient can enroll in Part 1 (OLE) of Study GA28951 to receive open -label etrolizumab, 
if eligible, or enter the 12 -week safety  follow -up of this study and then enroll in Part 2 (SM) of 
StudyGA28951 for extended PML moni toring.  These patients will be classified as 
non-responders at Week14 and may  not continue into the Maintenance Phase of the trial.
During the Maintenance Phase
Initiation or escalation of oral 5 -ASA should be avoided but is permitted if deemed clinicall y 
necessary by the investigator.  Patients who initiate or escalate oral 5 -ASA therapy may 
continue blinded treatment.
Use of topical or IV corticosteroids or topical 5- ASA is not desired as concomitant medication.  If 
these are used to treat clinical sy mptoms of UC, the patient may remain in the blinded study or 
may enroll in Part 1 (OLE) of Study GA28951, if eligible, based on the investigator’s discretion.  
Patients who leave the treatment period early to enroll in Part 1 (OLE) of Study GA28951 
should co mplete the early withdrawal from treatment visit prior to enrollment in Study  GA28951 .
Etrolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd
17/Protocol GA28950, Version 8Patients must begin the specified corticosteroid taper at Week 14 during the Maintenance 
Phase.  For patients who cannot tolerate the corticosteroid taper without recurr ence of clinical 
symptoms of either UC or cortico steroid withdrawal, corticosteroids may  be increased (up to the 
baseline dose, only if required).  In such cases, the tapering regimen must be reinitiated within 
2weeks.  An increase in corticosteroid dose back to baseline is not considered rescue 
medication if it occurs during the corticosteroid taper.  These patients should remain in the 
blinded study.
Patients who were not receiving corticosteroids at baseline and patients who have completed 
the corticost eroid taper who subsequently require oral corticosteroids at a dose greater than 
10mg for 5 days or longer for the treatment of worsening UC s ymptoms or corticosteroid 
withdrawal may  remain in the blinded study or may enroll in Part 1 (OLE) of Study GA289 51, if 
eligible, based on the investigator’s discretion.  Patients who leave the treatment period early to 
enroll in Part 1 (OLE) of Study GA28951 should complete the early withdrawal from treatment 
visit prior to enrollment in Study  GA28951 .
Immunosuppres sants (AZA, 6 -MP, or MTX):  Patients are to remain on their stable, baseline 
dose of immunosuppressant therapy throughout the study unless dose reduction or 
discontinuation is required due to toxicity.  Generally accepted criteria for discontinuation of 
immunosuppressants due to toxicity include but are not limited to acute pancreatitis, severe 
leukopenia, severe thrombocytopenia, or clinically significant elevations of the liver associated 
enzy mes from baseline, especially in the presence of an elevated to tal bilirubin.  The ultimate 
decision to reduce dose or discontinue immunosuppressants due to toxicity remains at the 
discretion of the investigator.  Patients who do initiate or escalate immunosuppressant therapy 
may rem ain in the blinded study or be give n the option to enroll in Part 1 (OLE) of 
StudyGA28951, if eligible, based on the investigator’s discretion.  Patients who leave the 
treatment period early to enroll in Part 1 (OLE) of Study GA28951 should complete the early 
withdrawal from treatment visi t prior to enrollment in Study GA28951.
Endoscopy to document disease activity for patients exiting the treatment period early for any 
reason is strongly recommended.
Rescue Therapy That Cannot be Given with Study Medication for the Treatment of UC
At ANY time during the conduct of the trial, use of other immunosuppressive agents including 
but not limited to anti -integrins, T or B cell depleters (except AZA and 6- MP), TNF inhibitors 
(including TNF inhibitor biosimilars), anti -adhesion molecules, Janus kina se (JAK) inhibitors,
cyclosporine, tacrolimus, or investigational agents are prohibited.  Patients who receive such 
therapies are not to receive further study treatment or open -label treatment and will be required 
to enter the 12 -week safety follow -up period of this study (see the protocol ).  These patients will 
also be requested to enroll in Part 2 (SM) of Study GA28951 for 92 weeks of extended PML 
monitoring.
A complete list of study visits and assessments can be found in the Schedule of Assessments 
(see the protocol for further details).  A complete list of eligibility for transfer of patients to 
OLE-SM and 12 -week safety follow -up is in the protocol.
Number of Patients
A total of approximately 605 patients will be enrolled from approximately 225sites via an open -
label induction arm (Cohort 1, n130) and a double -blind induction arm (Cohort 2, n 475).
Cohort 2 patients will be randomized in a 4:1 ratio to etrolizumab 105mg SC (n ≈380) or 
placebo (n ≈95) Q4 W.  Patients in theetrolizumab arm of Cohort 2 who achieved a clinical 
response at Week 14 (see protocol for definition of clinical response) and all Week14 clinical 
responders in Cohort 1 will be randomized into the Maintenance Phase and will receive either 
etrolizumab (105 mg SC Q4 W)or placebo in a 1:1 ratio.  It is estimated that t he planned 
approximately 510etrolizumab patients from Cohort 1 and Cohort 2 will provide approximately
154patients in clinical response for randomization into the Maintenance Phase.  Additional 
patients may be enrolled into Cohort 1, if needed, to meet sample size requirements for the 
Maintenance Phase .

Inves tigational Medicinal Products
Test Product
Etrolizumab prefilled s yringe (PFS):  containing SC formulation, 105 mg given as 0.7 mL of a 
150 mg/mL solution will be administered by SC injection Q4 W.
Comparator
Placebo PFS:  etrolizumab SC matching placebo gi ven in the amount of 0.7 mL solution will be 
administered by SC injection Q4 W.
Non-Investigational Medicinal Products
Patients are to continue on their baseline dose of corticosteroid (including budesonide) to the 
end of the Induction Phase (W eek 14).  Tap ering of corticosteroid (including budesonide) is to 
be attempted during the Maintenance Phase.
Patients should remain on their stable baseline doses of immunosuppressants (AZA, 6 -MP, 
MTX) throughout the study unless dose reduction or discontinuation is re quired because of a 
toxicity related to the medication.  Generally accepted criteria for discontinuing 
immunosuppressants due to toxicity include but are not limited to acute pancreatitis, severe 
leukopenia, severe thrombocytopenia, or clinically significant elevations of the liver -associated 
enzy mes from baseline, especially in the presence of an elevated total bilirubin.  The ultimate 
decision to reduce dose or discontinue immunosuppressants due to toxicity remains at the 
discretion of the investigator.
Probiotics and oral 5 -ASA may be continued at a stable dose throughout the study.

25/Protocol GA28950, Version 8Occasional use of NSAIDs and acetaminophen (e.g., headache, arthritis, m yalgias, menstrual 
cramps) and aspirin up to 325 mg daily are permitted throughout the study.
Antidiarrheals (e.g., loperamide, diphenoxylate with atropine) for control of chronic diarrhea are 
permitted throughout the study.
Statistical Methods
Primary A nalysis
For the purpose of statistical analyses, the Induction and Maintenance Phases will be tr eated as 
two independent studies.  The analysis of the Induction Phase will formally evaluate the efficacy  
and safety of 105 mg etrolizumab SC Q4W  versus placebo as an induction therapy.
The analysis of the Maintenance Phase will formally evaluate the effi cacy and safety of 
105mgetrolizumab SC Q4W  versus placebo as a maintenance therapy.
The analysis of data from the 66 -week treatment period (Induction and Maintenance Phases) 
will be performed when all data from this period are in the database and data ha ve been 
cleaned and verified.
Whereas Sponsor personnel will be unblinded to treatment assignment to perform the primary 
analyses, patients and study site personnel will remain blinded to individual treatment 
assignment (for Cohort 2 patients and those re -randomized into the Maintenance Phase) until 
after the study is completed (after all patients have either completed the safety follow -up periods 
or discontinued early from the study) and the database is locked.
Detailed specifications of the statistical methods will be described in the Statistical Analysis Plan.
Determination of Sample Size  
The study sample size was selected so that sufficient patients are enrolled to evaluate the 
primary  endpoints in the blinded Induction Phase and the Maintenance Phase respectively.  
Approximately 605patients will be enrolled in the open -label induction arm (Cohort 1, n ≈130) or 
the blinded induction cohort (Cohort 2, n ≈475).
Cohort 2 patients will be randomized in a 4:1 ratio to etrolizumab (n ≈380) or placebo (n ≈ 95).  
This will provide approximately 80 % power to detect a 10% difference in remission rates at 
Week14 between the etrolizumab and placebo arms, under the assumption of a placebo 
remission rate of 5% and a two -sided 2testat the 5% significance leve l.
The primary  endpoint for the Maintenance Phase is Week 66 remission among patients with a 
clinical response at W eek 14.In total, it is estimated that approximately 154 etrolizumab 
patients will achieve clinical response at the end of the Induction Phase and therefore will be 
randomized in the Maintenance Phase, under the assumption of a Week 14 clinical response 
rate of approximately 30% in the pooled etrolizumab induction group .
A sample size of 154 pa tients in the Maintenance Phase will provide 90% power to detect a 
30% difference in remission rates between the two maintenance arms, under the assumption of 
a placebo Week 66 rem ission rate  10% and a Fisher exact test at the 5% significance level .
The planned approximately 510 etrolizumab patients from Cohort 1 and Cohort 2 would provide 
approximately 154patients with a clinical response at W eek14, under the assumption of a 
Week 14 clinical response rate of at least 30% in the pooled (Cohort 1 and Cohort 2) 
etrolizumab induction group.  Additional patients may be enrolled into Cohort 1, if needed, to 
achieve this target number of approximately 154 patients randomized into the Maintenance 
Phas e.
For the purpose of statistical analyses and sample siz e calculations, the Induction and 
Maintenance Phases will be treated as two independent studies, and as such no adjustment to 
alpha is required.

29/Protocol GA28950, Version 81. BACKGROUND
1.1 BACKGROUND ON ULCERA TIVE COLITIS
Ulcerative colitis (UC) is an idiopathic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that affects the 
colon in a diffuse, continuous, and superficial pattern.   Approximately 40% 50% of 
patients have disease limited to the rectum and rectosigmoid colon, 30% 40% have 
disease extending beyond the sigmoid but not involving the whole colon, and 20% have 
a total colitis.  Proximal spread occurs in continuity without areas of uninvolved mucosa.  
When the whole colon is involved, the inflammation extends 2 3 cm into the termi nal 
ileum in 10% 20% of patients.
UC is characterized by mucosal ulceration, rectal bleeding, diarrhea, and abdominal pain 
and may be complicated by severe bloody diarrhea and toxic megacolon, requiring 
major and sometimes urgent surgery.  UC represents dy sregulation of the mucosal 
immune system in genetically susceptible individuals in response to commensal 
microbiota and other environmental triggers.  The overall incidence of UC ranges from 
6.3to24.3 cases per 100,000 persons per year, and prevalence ra nges from 
4.9to505.0 cases per 100,000 persons, with the highest estimates in European and 
Northern American populations ( Molodecky etal.2012 ).  Although the incidence and 
prevalence vary between regions of the world, both have been increasing in some 
regions, which may be due in part to better detection and diagnosis, as well as 
environmental factors such as improved hygiene and W estern diet.  The disease can 
affect any age group, but occurrence peaks between the ages of 15 and 35 years.
The goals of treatment are to induce and maintain remission, decrease corticosteroid 
use (as measured by corticosteroid -free remission), induce mucosal healing, reduce 
hospitalization and surgery, improve quality of life (QOL), and avoid disability.  For mildly 
to moder ately active UC, oral and rectal preparations o f 5-aminosalicylate (5 -ASA) 
medications are used either alone or together and result in remission in approximately 
50% of patients.  Patients whose UC fails to respond to 5- ASA drugs or who have 
moderately to severely active UC often receive conventional therapy, including 
corticosteroids and immunomodulator therapy (e.g., azathioprine [AZA], 
6-mercaptopurine [ 6-MP], and methotrexate [MTX]).  Corticosteroids achieve remission
in about 70% of patients, but approximately 20% become corticosteroid dependent and 
only half maintain corticosteroid -free remission ( Faubion et al. 2001 ).  Corticosteroids 
are also associated with significant side effects, such as infections, osteopenia, glucose 
intolerance, and adrenal suppression.  Immunomodulators, such as 6 -MP, AZA, and 
MTX, have also been used to achieve corticosteroid -free remission, but efficacy in 
maintaining corticosteroid -free remission is modest ( Lobel et al. 2004; Chebli et al . 2010; 
Mañosa etal.2011 ; Khan et al. 2013).  In addition, these medications are associated 
with significant side effects, including hepatotoxicity, pancreatitis, and bone marrow 
suppression.
Etrolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd
30/Protocol GA28950, Version 8Monoclonal antibodies ( MAbs) targeting tumor necrosis factor -alpha (TNF -), such as 
infliximab and adalimumab, have been used to induce and maintain remission in patients 
whose immuno modulatory therapy fails, are corticosteroid dependent or refractory, and 
have moderately to severely active UC.  These biologic agents induce remission in up to 
40% of patients, but sustained remission is seen in only 10% 20% of patients over 1 
year ( Rutgeerts etal.2005 ;Sandborn et al. 2013 ).  Importantly, TNF inhibitor therapies 
are associated with serious adverse events, such as bacterial infection, including 
tuberculosis (TB), disseminated fungal infections, lymphoma, and demyelination 
(Chang andLichtenstein 2006 ).  In fulminant corticosteroi d-unresponsive colitis, 
infliximab and (less commonly) cyclosporine are utilized as bridging agents to avoid 
urgent colectomy.  W ith either therapy, however, treatment failure occurs in 
approximately 55% 60% of patients ( Laharie et al. 2012 ).
In short, a l arge proportion of patients with moderately to severely active UC do not 
maintain a durable response to therapy.  Available therapies are associated with 
significant adverse events and at best achieve sustained remission in only 10% 30% 
ofIBD patients who have chronic disease (Hanauer et al. 2002; Sandborn et al. 2005 ; 
Feagan et al. 2013 ).  Patients whose disease fails to respond to medical therapy may be 
treated with total proctocolectomy with an ileal pouch- anal anastomosis.  Although 
surgical interventi on may be curative, complications such as chronic pouchitis, fecal 
incontinence, or decreased female fertility can occur ( Bradley andOliva -Hemker 2012 ).  
The current treatments are associated with significant adverse events, resulting in low 
rates of sust ained remission, or are highly invasive.
Consequently, there continues to be a high unmet medical need in moderately to 
severely active UC.  Targeted therapy with an improved safety profile and ability to 
sustain remission and prevent long -term complications would provide a valuable 
therapeutic option for these patients.
1.2 BACKGROUND ON ETROLI ZUMA B
A new class of molecules targeting the integrin receptors that regulate leukocyte 
trafficking to specific tissues in the body have been developed for treatment of IBD.  
Clinical studies have shown evidence of efficacy for these agents, including natalizumab 
(anti-4) for Crohn's disease ( CD)(Sandborn et al. 2005) and vedolizumab (anti -47) 
for UC and CD (Feagan et al. 2005 , 2008) ; both agents have been approved for their 
respective indications. Natalizumab and vedolizumab require IV administration, but 
only vedolizumab is gut -selective.  Natalizumab is not gut -selective and is associated 
with the risk of progressive multifocal leuk oencephalopathy (PML ).  Etrolizumab 
distinguishes itself from these molecules by specifically binding the integrin 7 subunit, 
found in both 47 (Holzmann et al. 1989 ; Hu etal. 1992 ) and E7 (Cepek et al. 1993), 
which regulate trafficking and retention of leukocyte/lymphocyte subsets, respectively, in 
the intestinal mucosa.
Etrolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd
31/Protocol GA28950, Version 8It is important to note that etrolizumab does not bind to 41 (target for natalizumab), 
which regulates trafficking to both mucosal and non -mucosal tissues, including the CNS.  
Etrolizumab, therefore, represents a novel gut mucosal selective anti-trafficking agent 
whose selectivity may enhance efficacy in UC and eliminate generalized 
immunosuppression by preferentially targeting trafficking to the gut rather than to other 
organs and t issues.  Data from multiple nonclinical toxicology studies of up to 6 months’ 
duration in adult animals demonstrated no adverse effects in any organ system 
(including the CNS and hematologic and cardiovascular systems).  No adverse events 
were observed in the embryo -fetal developmental toxicity studies.
Etrolizumab is a humanized M Ab based on the human IgG1 subgroup -IIIVH, 
subgroup -1 V Lconsensus sequences and was constructed using standard 
recombinant DNA techniques.  This recombinant antibody consists of two heavy chains 
(446 residues) and two light chains (214 residues) and is produced in Chinese hamster 
ovary (CHO) cells that have been genetically engineered to synthesize the antibody.  
The protein is manufactured in bioreactors and purified using a s eries of harvest, 
purification, and formulation steps.  The potency of etr olizumab is determined by an 
invitro assay that measures the inhibition of adhesion of 47-expressing cells to 
mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule fragment crystallizable regi on (MAdCAM -Fc).
Safety assessments for etrolizumab have been completed in the adult Phase I, Phase II, 
and Phase II open -label extension (OLE) studies without significant safety concerns.
The following is a summary of the etrolizumab safety experience to d ate:
There were no observed significant adverse effects in multiple nonclinical toxicity 
studies of up to 6 months’ duration in adult animals or in embryo -fetal 
developmental toxicity studies.  No adverse effects were seen in any organ system 
(including the CNS, hematologic, and cardiovascular systems), no effects were seen 
in embryo -fetal development, and there was no evidence of increased rates of 
infection.
No significant adverse safety signal, including any evidence of increased rates of 
serious or oppo rtunistic infections, was associated with etrolizumab treatment in the 
Phase I or Phase II trials in adult patients with moderately to severely active UC who 
received either single or multiple doses of intravenous (IV) or subcutaneous (SC) 
etrolizumab.
No events of PML have been reported in etrolizumab- treated patients.
See the most recent Investigator's Brochure for details on nonclinical and clinical studies.
1.3 STUDY RA TIONA LE A ND BENEFIT -RISK A SSESSM ENT
Although there are therapeutic options including TNF inhibitors , a significant proportion 
of patients with UC will not experience a durable clinical benefit with those treatment 
options.  Furthermore, adverse events associated with TNF inhibitors include elevated 
rates of serious bacterial infection, including TB, and (more rarely) lymphoma and 
Etrolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd
32/Protocol GA28950, Version 8demyelination ( Chang andLichtenstein 2006).  No currently available therapy , including 
approved anti -integrins (natalizumab forCD and vedolizumab forUC and CD) ,
achieves sustained remission in more than 10% 30% of patients with IBD who have 
chronic disease (Hanauer etal.2002; Sandborn et al. 2005 ; Feagan et al. 2013).  As 
noted above, etrolizumab distinguishes itself from other anti -integrins on the basis of gut
selectivity combined with a potential dual me chanism of action.  It binds E7 in addition 
to 47 and so regulates retention as well as trafficking leucocyte/lymphocyte in the 
intestinal mucosa.
No clinically significant safety signals were detected on administration of etrolizumab to 
patients with moderate to severe UC across a dose range of 0.3 10.0 mg /kgIV/SC in 
the single ascending dose stage and of 0.5 3.0 mg/kg SC and 4 mg/kg IV monthly for 
3doses in the multidose stage of the Phase I study or in the Phase II study of 
120patients.
A global Phase II multicenter study (Study ABS4986g; EUCALYPTUS) designed to 
determine the exposure -response relationship and to further characterize the safety and 
tolerability of etrolizumab in treatment of adult patients with moderate to severely active 
UC patients has been completed.  P atients were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive 
100mg etrolizumab SC (0.7 mLof 150 mg/mL solution via vial and syringe, with an 
intended nominal dose of 100 mg) at Weeks 0, 4, and 8 or 420 mg SC at W eek 0 
(loading dose [LD]) followed by 300 mg SC (three injections of 0.7 mL of 150 mg/mL 
solution via vial and syringe, with an intended nominal dose of 300 mg) at Weeks 2, 4, 
and 8 (40 patients per dose arm) versus matching placebo SC (40patients per arm).  
The primary objective of the study was to obtain evidence of clinical efficacy of 
etrolizumab as measured by induction of clinical remission (Mayo Clinic Score [MCS] 2 
and no individual subscore 1)at Week 10 (2 weeks after the final dose).
Etrolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd
33/Protocol GA28950, Version 8In EUCALYPTUS, etrolizumab showed clinically meaningful efficacy for both doses 
relative to placebo for the primary endpoint :  the proportion of patients in clinical 
remission at Week 10 was 20.5% in the 100 -mg dose group and 10.3% in 
the300-mgLD group versus 0% in the placebo g roup (p 0.004 and p 0.048, 
respectively) .  In the TNF -naive subgroup, clinical remission at W eek 10 was observed 
in 43.8% versus 0 % of patients in the 100 -mg etrolizumab versus placebo group, and in 
25% of 300 mgLD group.  In the inadequate response to anti -tumor necrosis factor
(TNF -IR) subgroup, which represents a refractory population with limited treatment 
options, clinical remission at W eek 10 was observed in 4.5% of the 100 mg etrolizumab 
group, 4% of the 300 mg LD group, and in 0% of the placebo group, respectively.   
However, data from SPRUCE (OLE Study GA27927) suggests that with longer duration 
of treatment, gut mucosal -selective anti -trafficking agents do benefit this patient 
population over time ( Feagan et al. 2012 ).  With 4 additional weeks of follow -up in OLE, 
clinically meaningful efficacy was observed:
31% (10 of 32) of TNF -IR patients who had not responded to etrolizumab by 
Week10 and rolled into the OLE achieved clinical response by partial Mayo Clinic 
Score (pMCS) at 14 weeks
9%(3 of 32) of TNF -IR patients who had not responded to etrolizumab by W eek10 
and rolled into the OLE achieved clinical remission by pMCS at 14 weeks
The present study is powered to detect a 10% difference in induction of remission rates 
between etrolizum ab and placebo -treated patients.  Given that patients failing TNF 
inhibitor therapy have very limited treatment options available to them, the TNF -IR 
patient population represent an unmet medical need population.  Consequently, the 
potential benefits of et rolizumab in this population warrant further investigation.
In summary, favorable safety (see Section 1.2) and efficacy data were observed in the 
Phase II EUCALYPTUS study and in the OLE study (SPRUCE).  Overall, e trolizumab 
showed compelling efficacy compared with placebo and there were no clini cally 
significant safety signals.  Additionally, etrolizumab distinguishes itself from vedolizumab 
by blocking E7 in addition to 47, which is involved in lymphocyte retention and may 
contribute to its efficacy and/or safety profile.  Etrolizumab is a g ut-selective
anti-trafficking agent and does not bind to 41 (target for natalizumab), which regulates 
trafficking to both mucosal and non -mucosal tissues, including the CNS.  Although 
natalizumab has been associated with an increased risk of PML, no even ts of PML to 
date have been reported during 2 -year PML extensive monitoring in the Phase II study, 
EUCALYPTUS, and OLE SPRUCE study.

38/Protocol GA28950, Version 83. STUDY DESIGN
3.1 DESCRIPTION OF STUDY
3.1.1 Overview  of Study  Design
This is a multicenter, Phase III, double -blind, placebo -controlled study evaluating the 
safety, efficacy, and tolerability of etrolizumab during induction and maintenance of 
remission compared with placebo in the treatment of moderately to severely active UC 
(see Figure 1).
Patients enrolled in this study may be eligible to participate in an open -label extension 
and safety monitoring (OLE -SM) study (GA28951), whi ch consists of two parts: Part 1 
(designated OLE [open -label extens ion]) and Part 2 (designated SM [safety 
monitoring]).
Disease severity will be measured using the MCS ( see Appendix 3),which is the current 
outcome measure accepted by regulatory authorities for drug development in UC.  The 
target population is patients with moderately to severely active UC (defined as MCS 
of612, endoscopy subscore of 2 as determined by the central read ing procedure 
described in Section 4.6.1.4, a rectal bleeding subscore 1, and a stool frequency 
subscore of ≥1)and involvement that extends a minimum of 20 cm from the anal verge.
Patients who are on background immunosuppressant th erapy (6 -MP, AZA, MTX) may 
be enrolled if they have received a stable dose for at least 8 weeks prior to Day 1.  Such 
patients should continue on stable doses of their background immunosuppressant 
therapy during the study unless dose reduction or discontinuation is required due to 
toxicity.   
Generally accepted criteria for discontinuation of immunosuppressants due to toxicity 
include ,but are not limited to ,acute pancreatitis, severe leukopenia, severe 
thrombocytopenia, or clinically significant elevations of the liver -associated enzymes 
from baseline especially in the presence of an elevated total bilirubin.  The ultimate 
decision to reduce dose or discontinue immunosuppressants due to toxicity remains at 
the discretion of the investigator.
Patients on o ral corticosteroid therapy (prednisone at a stable dose of 30 mg, or 
equivalent) may be enrolled according to the following criteria:
If corticosteroid therapy is ongoing or has recently been initiated , the dose has to be 
stable for at least 4 we eks immediately prior to Day 1
If corti costeroids are being tapered, the dose has to be stable for at least 2weeks 
immediately prior to Day 1 
Such patients should continue stable doses of their background corticosteroid until 
Week14, at which point a corticosteroid taper will be initiated.  
Etrolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd
39/Protocol GA28950, Version 8Initiation of corticosteroid or an increase in corticosteroid dose above the patients’ entry 
dose (up to a maximum of 30 mg/day prednisone [or equivalent] )will not be permitted 
during screenin g.  Use of budesonide will be allowed at stable doses ( 9 mg) if the dose 
has been stable for 4 weeks prior to Day 1.   Oral 5-ASA treatment and probiotics for 
the treatment of UC may be continued at a stable dose as long as the dose(s) had been 
stable f or 4 weeks and 2weeks, respectively, prior to Day 1 .  Certain concomitant 
treatments are prohibited (see Section 4.1.2 for list of all prohibited concomitant 
treatments).  Patients must have discontinued TNF inhibitor treatment and topical 
treatments for UC at least 8 weeks and 2weeks prior to Day 1, respect ively.
The study will be divided into:
Screening period of up to 35days during which patient eligibility will be determined
(for details see Section 4.6.2.1)
Induction Phase of 14 weeks (Cohort 1: open- label etrolizumab treatment; 
Cohort 2:randomized to etrolizumab or placebo)
Randomization of etrolizumab responders prior to a double- blind Maintenance
Phase of 52 weeks or continued blinded treatment with placebo Q4 W for 52 weeks 
for placebo induction responders 
Safety follow -up period of 12 weeks
A total of approximately 605patients will be recruited (see Figure 1) from approximately 
225sites via an open- label induction arm (Cohort 1, n 130) and a double -blind 
induction arm (Cohort 2, n 475), which will be enrolled sequentially.
Cohort 1 patients will receive open -label etrolizumab 105 mg S CQ4W during the 
14-week Induction Phase.  Cohort 2 patients will be randomized in a 4:1 ratio to 105mg 
etrolizumab SC Q4 W (n≈380) or placebo (n ≈95) during the 14 -week Inducti on Phase.  
Randomization will be stratified by concomitant treatment with corticosteroids (including 
budesonide) (yes/no), concomitant treatment with immunosuppressants (yes/no), and 
disease activity measured during screening (MCS9/MCS 10).
Eligibility for entry into the Maintenance Phase will be determined between W eeks 14 
and 16.  Patients in theetrolizumab arm of Cohort 2 who achieved a clinical response at 
Week14 (see Table 1 for definition of clinical response) and all W eek14 clinical 
responders in Cohort 1 will be randomized into the Maintenance Phase and will receive 
either etrolizumab ( 105mg SC Q4 W)or placebo in a 1:1 ratio.  Randomization will be 
stratified by remission status at Week 14, concomitant treatment with corticosteroids
(including budesonide) at baseline, disease activity measured during screening
(MCS 9/MCS 10),and induction cohort (Cohort 1/Cohort 2).  It is estimated that t he 
planned approximately 510etrolizumab patients from Cohort 1 and Cohort 2 will provide 
approximately 154patients in clinical response for randomization into the Maintenance 
Phase.  Additional patients may be enrolled into Cohort 1, if needed, to achieve a 
sufficient number of patients in the Maintenance Phase.
Etrolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd
40/Protocol GA28950, Version 8Patients initially randomized to placebo will also be assessed for clinical response at 
Week14.  Patients achieving a clinical response will continue to receiv e blinded placebo 
during the Maintenance Phase of the study.  Patients in either Cohort 1 or Cohort 2, who 
do not achieve clinical response at W eek 14, patients who have clinical relapse during 
the Maintenance Phase, patients who receive defined rescue treatment 
(see Section 4.3.2.2), and patients who complete 66 weeks of the study may be given 
the option of enrolling into Part 1 (OLE) of Study GA28951 , where they will receive 
open -label etrolizumab treatment ,ifeligibl e.  If patients choose not to enroll in 
Part 1(OLE) of Study GA28951 ,they will enter the 12- week safety follow -up period of 
thisstudy and then will be requested to enroll in Part 2 (SM) of Study GA28951 for 
92weeks of extended PML monitoring.
Study Drug Administration
The first twodoses of study medication will be administered via a prefilled syring e (PFS)
by a health care professional (HCP) in the clinic.  The subsequent two doses will be 
self-administered by the patient or his or her caregiver in the clinic; if deemed 
appropriate by the HCP, the remaining doses of study drug, starting at W eek 16, will be 
self-administered by the patient or administered by his or her caregiver at home Q4 W 
(action to be taken as a result of a hypersensitivity reaction is provided in Section 5.1.5 ).  
The administration of the study medication at home by the patients or their caregivers 
will occur af ter their study assessments in the clinic setting.  If necessary, patients or 
their HCPs may choose to continue administration of study medication in the clinic.  The 
details of study medication administration are provided in Section 4.3.2 .
Oral Corticosteroids during the Study
During the Induction Phase, patients are to maintain their stable baseline corticosteroid 
dose.  Corticosteroids are to be tapered starting from W eek 14 for patients entering the 
Maintenance Phase.  Patients receiving prednisone at a dose of 10 mg/day (or 
equivalent) are to have their dose reduced at a rate of 5 mg per week until a 10 mg/day 
dose is achieved.  Patients receiving prednisone at doses 10mg/day (or equivalent), or 
once a 10 mg/day dose (or equivalent) is achieved by tapering, are to have their dose 
reduced at a rate of 2.5 mg/week until discontinuation.  Beginning at W eek 14, patients
receiving budesonide who achieve clinical response at W eek 14 should taper their dose 
of 9 mg every day to 9 mg every other day for 2 weeks and then discontinue budesonide 
treatment.  For patients who cannot tolerate the corticosteroid taper without recur rence 
of clinical symptoms of either UC or corticosteroid withdrawal, corticosteroid dose may 
be increased (up to the dose at study entry if required), but tapering must begin again 
within 2 weeks.
Etrolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd
41/Protocol GA28950, Version 8Immunosuppressants during the Study
Patients should contin uestable doses of immunosuppressants throughout the 
study .
Patients should remain on their stable baseline doses of immunosuppressants (AZA, 
6-MP, MTX) throughout the study unless dose reduction or discontinuation is required 
because of a toxicity related to the medication. Generally accepted criteria for
discontinuation of immunosuppressants due to toxicity include but are not limited to 
acute pancreatitis, severe leukopenia, severe thrombocytopenia, or clinically significant 
elevations of the liver associated enzymes from baseline, especially in the presence of 
an elevated total bilirubin.  The ultimate decision to reduce dose or discontinue 
immunosuppressants due to toxicity remains at the discretion of the invest igator.
3.1.1.1 Definition of Clinical Relapse
Clinical relapse is defined as an:
Increase in partial Mayo Clinic Score (pMCS) 3 points compared to induction 
timepoint (W eek 14) AND absolute pMCS 5 AND endoscopic subscore 2
If a patient meets criteria for c linical relapse during the Maintenance Phase of the study, 
he or she may withdraw from this study and enroll in Part 1 (OLE) of Study GA28951
ifeligible.
3.1.1.2 Rescue Therapy
Rescue Therapy  That Can Be Given with Study Medication for the 
Treatment of UC
During the Induction Phase (prior to Week 14)
Patients are required to maintain stable doses of their concomitant medications (oral 
5-ASA, corticosteroids, immunosuppressants) for UC.
In the Induction Phase, any patient who requires initiation of an immunosuppres sant
(AZA, 6 -MP, or MTX) ,oral or topical 5 -ASA, or corticosteroid, or increase in dose over 
baseline levels for treatment of worsening disease symptoms, should stay in the study 
until W eek14, at which time the patient can enroll in Part 1 (OLE) of Study GA28951 to 
receive open- label etrolizumab, if eligible, or enter the 12- week safety follow -up of this 
study and then enroll in Part 2 (SM) of Study GA28951 for extended PML monitoring.  
These patients will be classified as non -responders at Week14 and may not continue 
into the Maintenance Phase of the trial.   
During the Maintenance Phase
Initiation or escalation of oral 5- ASA should be avoided but is permitted if deemed 
clinically necessary by the investigator.  Patients who initiate or escalate oral 5 -ASA 
therapy may continue blinded treatment.
Etrolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd
42/Protocol GA28950, Version 8Use of topical or IV corticosteroids or topical 5 -ASA is not desired as concomitant 
medication.  If these are used to treat clinical symptoms of UC, the patient may remain in 
the blinded study or may enroll in Part 1 (OLE) of Study GA28951, if eligible, based on 
the investigator’s discretion.  Patients who leave the treatment period early to enroll in 
Part 1 (OLE) of Study GA28951 should complete the early withdrawal from treatment 
visit prior to enrollment in Study GA28951 . 
Patients must begin the specified corticosteroid taper at Week 14 during the 
Maintenance Phase.  For patients who cannot tolerate the corticosteroid taper without 
recurrence of clinical symptoms of either UC or corticosteroid withdrawal, corticosteroids 
may be increased (up to the baseline dose, only if required).  In such cases, the tapering 
regimen must be reinitiated within 2 weeks.  An increase in corticosteroid dose back to 
baseline is not considered rescue medication if it occurs during the corticosteroid taper.  
These patients should remain in the blinded study.
Patients who were not receiving corticosteroids at baseline and patients who have 
completed the corticosteroid taper who subsequently require oral corticosteroids at a 
dose greater than 10 mg for 5 days or longer for the treatment of worsening UC 
symptoms or corticosteroid withdrawal may remain in the blinded study or may enroll in 
Part 1 (OLE) of Study GA28951 , if eligible, based on the investigator’s discretion.   
Patients who leave the treatment period early to enroll in Part 1 (OLE) of 
Study GA28951 should complete the early withdrawal from treatment visit prior to 
enrollment in Study GA28951 .
Immunosuppressants (AZA, 6 -MP, or MTX):  Patients are to remain on their stable, 
baseline dose of immunosuppressant therapy throughout the study unless dose 
reduction or discontinuation is required due to toxicity.  Generally accepted criteria for 
discontinuation of immunosuppressants due to toxicity include but are not lim ited to 
acute pancreatitis, severe leukopenia, severe thrombocytopenia, or clinically significant 
elevations of the liver associated enzymes from baseline, especially in the presence of 
an elevated total bilirubin.  The ultimate decision to reduce dose or discontinue 
immunosuppressants due to toxicity remains at the discretion of the investigator.  
Patients who do initiate or escalate immunosuppressant therapy may remain in the 
blinded study or be given the option to enroll in Part 1 (OLE) of Study GA28951 ,if 
eligible, based on the investigator’s discretion. Patients who leave the treatment period 
early to enroll in Part 1 (OLE) of Study GA28951 should complete the early withdrawal 
from treatment visit prior to enrollment in Study GA28951.
Endoscopy to doc ument disease activity for patients exiting the treatment period early 
for any reason is strongly recommended.
Etrolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd
43/Protocol GA28950, Version 8Rescue Therapy  That Cannot Be Given w ith Study  Medication for the 
Treatment of UC
At ANY time during the conduct of the trial, use of other immunosuppressive agents 
including but not limited to anti -integrins, T or B cell depleters (except AZA and 6 -MP), 
TNF inhibitors (including TNF inhibitor biosimilars ), anti -adhesion molecules ,Janus 
kinase (JAK) inhibitors, cyclosporine, tacrolimus, or investigational agents are 
prohibited.  Patients who receive such therapies are not to receive further study 
treatment or open -label treatment and will be required to enter the 12 -week safety 
follow -up period of this study ( seeAppendix 2).  These patients will also be requested to 
enroll in Part 2 (SM) of Study GA28951 for92weeks of extended PML monitoring.
A complete list of study visi ts and assessments can be found in the Schedule of 
Assessments (see Appendix 1).

A total of approximately 605patients will be enrolled from approximately 225sites via an 
open -label induction arm (Cohort 1, n130) and a double -blind induction arm (Cohort 2, 
n475).
Cohort 2 patients will be randomized in a 4:1 ratio to etrolizumab 105mg SC (n ≈380) or 
placebo (n ≈95) Q4W.  Patients in the etrolizumab arm of Cohort 2 who achieved a 
clinical response at W eek 14 ( see Table 1 for definition of clinical response) and all 
Week14 clinical responders in Cohort 1 will be randomized into the Maintenance Phase 
and will receive either etrolizumab ( 105mg SC Q4W )or placebo in a 1:1 ratio.  It is 
estimated that t he planned approximately 510etrolizumab patients from Cohort 1 and 
Cohort 2 will provide approximately 154patients in clinical response for randomization 
into the Maintenance Phase.  Additional patients may be enrolled into Cohort 1, if 
needed, to meet sample size requirements for t he Maintenance Phase .
3.1.2 Data Monitoring Committee
An independent Data Monitoring Committee (iDMC) will monitor safety and study 
conduct on an ongoing basis.  Members of the iDMC will be external to the Sponsor and 
will follow a charter that outlines the iDMC roles and responsibilities.  The iDMC will 
meet approximately every 6 months (frequency adjustable as required) to review 
unblinded safety and study conduct data prepared by an independent data coordinating 
center (IDCC).  If the iDMC deems a risk -benefit assessment necessary, the iDMC may 
also review unblinded efficacy data.  The iDMC may recommend stopping the study 
early for safety reasons.  However, the iDMC may not recommend stopping the trial 
early for positive efficacy or solely for futility.
3.2 END OF STUD Y AND LENGTH OF STUD Y
Length of Study
The total length of the treatment period will be 66 weeks .Patients who do not achieve a 
clinical response at Week 14, patients who have clinical relapse during the Maintenance 
Phase, patients who receive defined rescue treatment (see Section 4.3.2.2), and 
patients who complete 66 weeks of the study may be given the option of enrolling into 
Part 1 ( OLE)of Study GA28951 , where they will receive open -label etrolizumab
treatment.  Those who do not enroll in Part 1 (OLE) of Study GA28951 will continue to 
12weeks of safety follow -up in this study and then be requested to enroll in Part 2 (S M) 
ofStudy GA28951 for 92 weeks of monitoring for PML.
The total length of the study is expected to last from the first patient screened to either 
the last patient in last follow -up visit in this protocol or last patient enrolled into the 
Study GA28951 (OLE -SM), whichever is the later.
Etrolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd

protocol or last patient in this protocol transferred to Study GA28951 (OLE -SM), 
whichever is later.
3.3 RATIONA LE FOR STUDY DESIGN
3.3.1 Rationale for Test Product Dosage
Data from Phase I (Study ABS4262g) and Phase II (Study ABS4986g; EUCALYPTUS) 
indicated that the nominal 100-mg Q4W  regimen is sufficient to maintain 7 receptor 
occupancy both in blood and in colonic tissue, is well tolerated, and results in meaningful 
clinical efficacy, and therefore, will be evaluated further in this Phase III study.  The 
rationale for proposing a 105-mg Q4 W SC regimen is discussed below.
InPhase II ,the nominal 100-mg Q4 W SC dose (0.7 mLof 150 mg/mL solution via 
vial and syringe, with an actual dose of 105 mg) showed clinically meaningful 
efficacy without clinically meaningful safety imbalances (see Section 1.2).  The 
Phase III formulation is a PFS containing 0.7 mLof 150 mg/mL etrolizumab solution, 
corresponding to delivering a dose of 105 mg etrolizumab per injection.
In the Phase II EUCALYPTUS study, the 100 -mg SC Q4 W dose resulted in an 
increased clinical remission rate in TNF -naive patients (43.8%; p0.007), as 
well as in the combined TNF -naive and TNF -IR group (20.5%; p0.004) at 
Week 10 as compared with the clinical remission rate in placebo patients (0%).  
These data suggest that the 100 -mg SC Q4W  dose regimen is efficacious in 
patients with moderately and severely active UC.
Up to a 4 5-fold higher exposure did not result in a greater PD effect or an increase 
in clinical benefit.
A higher dose (420 mg SC at Week 0 followed by 300 mg at W eeks 2, 4, and 8) 
was also tested in the EUCALYPTUS study without any major safety concerns.  
However, there was no clear distinction in observed pharmacological effects 
(including clinical efficacy outcome and PD response, s uch as 7 receptor 
occupancy) between high -dose and the 100- mg dose cohorts.  Although the 
study was not powered to enable a formal comparison of the two active arms, 
the data suggest that the observed clinical remission rate at Week 10 in the 
low-dose coh ort was not further improved in the high -dose cohort. 
Preliminary concentration quartile- response analysis was conducted, for the 
data pooled from both low -and high -dose cohorts, to see whether patients in 
the higher concentration quartiles had better re mission rate.  The results did not 
show any exposure response relationship.
Etrolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd
47/Protocol GA28950, Version 8Exposure lower than 100 mg Q4 W is likely not sufficient to maintain 7 integrin 
receptor occupancy.
In the Phase I study (Study ABS4262g), the etrolizumab PK profile appears 
nonlin ear at a dose level of 1 mg/kg IV.  The duration of 7 receptor 
occupancy is dose dependent.  A single dose of0.3 mg/kg IV maintained 
7receptor occupancy for only approximately 2 weeks, which is likely 
insufficient to ensure maximal 7 receptor occupancy at all times within a 
Q4Wdosing interval.
On the basis of data from the Phase II EUCALYPTUS study, it is assumed that 
maximal/near maximal occupancy of 7 receptors both in the blood and in 
colonic tissue is minimally necessary for etrolizumab’s clini cal activity.  Per this 
assumption, population PK simulations were performed and results showed that 
a 100 -mg SC Q4 W regimen can provide steady -state serum trough 
concentration (C trough,ss ) of at least 1.7 g/mL (the minimum serum concentration 
observed that maintained colonic tissue 7occupancy) in 84% of patients, 
whereas a dose lower than the 100 -mgSC Q4 W regimen (e.g., 50 mg Q4W SC) 
is likely not sufficient for maintaining 7receptor occupancy at all times during 
the Q4 W dosing interval, since only 56% of patients were predicted to reach a 
1.7g/mL level in their C trough,ss (see Table 2 ).
Lower doses are also anticipated to result in etrolizumab serum level falling into 
the nonlinear PK concentration range and hence are likely to increase variability 
in exposure.

Note:  1.7 g/mL is the minimum serum concentration observed in the 
Phase II study that maintained 7 occupancy in the colonic tissue.
In conclusion, on the basis of available etrolizumab efficacy, PK, PD, and safety data 
(see Section 1.2), a PFS delivering a dose of 105 mg Q4 W is considered the most 
appropriate dosing regimen for this Phase III study.
3.3.2 Rationale for Patient Population
There is a high unmet medical need in mode rately to severely active UC due to current 
treatments being associated with significant adverse events, resulting in low rates of 
sustained remission, or being hig hly invasive (i.e., colectomy; see Section 1.1for details).  
Etrolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd
48/Protocol GA28950, Version 8The Phase II EUCALYPTUS study provided evidence of efficacy in patients with 
moderately to severely active UC refractory to or intolerant of conventional and/or TN F
inhibitor therapies.  Results from this trial showed that at W eek 10, the proportions of 
patients in clinical remission ( defined as MCS 2and all subscores 1) in the overall 
population (both TNF- naive and TNF -IR) were 20.5% in the 100 -mg arms compared 
with0% in the placebo arm.  Data from SPRUCE (the OLE study) suggests that with 
longer duration of treatment, gut -selective anti -trafficking agents do benefit this patient 
population over time ( Feagan et al. 2012 ).  With 4additional weeks of fo llow-up in OLE, 
clinically meaningful benefit was observed:
31% (10 of 32) of TNF -IR patients who had not responded to etrolizumab by 
Week10 and rolled into the OLE achieved clinical response by pMCS at 14 weeks
9% (3 of 32) of TNF -IR patients who had not responded to etrolizumab by W eek10 
and rolled into the OLE achieved clinical remission by pMCS at 14 weeks
In summary, because of the limitations of the currently available therapies for the 
treatment of moderately to severely active UC and the favorabl e benefit -risk observed in 
EUCALYPTUS, t his Phase III trial is designed to test the efficacy and safety of 
etrolizumab in this patient population.
3.3.3 Rationale for Control Group
A placebo- treated control group will be used in this study to assess the differences in 
efficacy, safety, and tolerability in patients who receive etrolizumab plus background UC 
therapy compared with patients who receive placebo plus background UC therapy.  The 
use of a control group is necessary given the inherent variability in disea se flares and 
the use of subjective assessments, such as the patient -reported outcomes (PROs) .  
Patients in the control group will undergo the same study assessments as the 
etrolizumab- treated patients.
3.3.4 Rationale for Biomarker A ssessments
A biomarker that may predict an increased chance of response to therapy would be 
valuable to patients and treating physicians to aid in guiding treatment decisions.  
Etrolizumab binds to the 7 integrin and blocks 47:MAdCAM and E7:E-cadherin 
binding.  In exploratory analyses from the Phase II EUCALYPTUS study, patients with 
higher baseline biopsy E gene expression by quantitative polymerase chain reaction 
(qPCR) and E+cell counts by immunohistochemistry (IHC) had a higher rate of 
remission at Week 10 (see Figure 2).  The baseline levels of E and other biomarkers 
will be evaluated in the Phase III study to further evaluate whether th ey may function as 
predictive response biomarkers in the TNF -IR patient population.

50/Protocol GA28950, Version 8All patients enrolled in the current study will have mandatory colonic mucosal sampling 
at the screening visit to analyze the relationship of E levels (and potentially other 
biomarkers) with response to treatment.  In addition, samples will be collected at 
Weeks14 and 66 for potential exploratory PD biomarker analyses that include ,but are 
not limited to ,E expression.

4.2 METHOD OF TREA TMENT ASSIGNMENT A ND BLIND ING 
Patients will be randomized into the Induction Phase through an interactive 
voice/W ebbased response system (IxRS).  After written informed consent has been 
obtained, all patients will receive a screening number, which will be assigned by the 
IxRS.  Following completion of the screening period and after all patient eligibility 
requirements are c onfirmed, patients will be assigned an identification number (a 
different number from the screening number) on Day 1 and will receive open -label 
etrolizumab (Cohort 1; see Figure 3) or will be randomized to either placebo or 
etrolizumab ( 105mgSC Q4W ; Cohort 2).  Randomization for Cohort 2 will be stratified 
by concomitant treatment with corticosteroids (yes/no), concomitant treatment wit h 
immunosuppressants (yes/no), and disease activity measured during screening 
(MCS 9/MCS 10).  A permuted blocks randomization method will be used to obtain an 
approximately 1:4 ratio between the placebo and etrolizumab arms in Cohort 2.  
AtWeek16, following receipt of the endoscopy score, etrolizumab patients from either 
Cohort 1 or from Cohort 2achieving a clinical response at W eek 14 (see Table 1 for 
definition of clinical response) will undergo a second randomization, stratified by 
remission status at Week 14 , concomitant treatment with corticosteroids (yes/no), 
disease activity measured during screening (MCS 9/MCS 10), and induction cohort 
(Cohort 1/ Cohort 2), to either 105mg etrolizumab SC or placebo in a 1:1 ratio 
(Maintenance Phase ).  In order to facilitate Maintenance Phase sensitivity analyses of 
outcomes for patients who achieved remission in the Induction Phase using alternative 
remission definitions (i.e. , not including the Physician’s Global Assessment [ PGA ]
subscore of the MCS among remission criteria) ,the W eek 14 remission status 
Etrolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd
59/Protocol GA28950, Version 8stratification variable will consist of three levels according to whether remission was 
achieved with or without inclusion of the PGA criteria described in Table 1 .
For the second randomization, a permuted blocks randomiz ation method will be used to 
obtain an approximately 1:1 ratio between the treatment and placebo arm within each 
stratum.  Study drug will be administered Q4 W for a total of 13 doses with the final dose 
given at Week 64 (see Appendix 1for details of study drug administration schedule).  
Patients achieving a clinical response while receiving placebo in the Induction Phase will 
continue on blinded placebo in the Maintenance Phase.
During the 14- week induction and 52 -week maintenance doub le-blind treatment periods, 
the IxRS will make etrolizumab/etrolizumab placebo study treatment kit assignments.  
Each kit will consist of one prefilled 1 -mL syringe (0.7 mL nominal volume).   At each 
dosing visit (occurring every 4 weeks) during the blinded treatment period, one study 
drug kit will be assigned for administration to each patient.  The placebo and active kits 
are filled and packaged to look identical. Patients performing study drug administration 
at home may receive 2 or 3 kits at a time begi nning at W eek 24 in order to allow 
sufficient supply until their next in -clinic visit.
Patients, all study site personnel, and the Sponsor and its agents will be blinded to 
treatment assignment throughout the 14 -week double -blind (Cohort 2) induction and 
52-week maintenance double -blind treatment periods.  The IxRS service provider and 
personnel responsible for performing PK assays (in order to identify appropriate dilutions 
of PK samples to be analyzed) will be unblinded to patients’ randomized treatment 
assignments. As described in Section 6, treatment assignment will be unblinded to the 
Sponsor personnel performing the analysis when a ll data through W eek66 are in the 
database and the data have been cleaned and verified.  However, patients and all study 
site personnel will remain blinded to individual treatment assignment until after the study 
is completed (after all patients have eith er completed the treatment and safety follow -up 
period or discontinued early from the study) and the database is locked.
If unblinding is necessary for patient management (in the case of a serious adverse 
event), the investigator will be able to break the treatment code by contacting the IxRS.  
Treatment codes should not be broken except in emergency situations.  If the 
investigator wishes to know the identity of the study drug for any other reason, he or she 
should contact the Medical Monitor.  The investigator should document and provide an 
explanation for any premature unblinding (e.g., accidental unblinding, unblinding due to 
a serious adverse event as per health authority reporting requirements).  The Sponsor 
Safety Reporting Department (independent from the study team) will break the treatment 
code for all unexpected serious adverse events (see Section 5.2.2 ) that are considered 
by the investigator to be related to study drug for the purpose of regulatory 
reporting. The study team will remain blinded to study treatment.

Investigational medicinal product Etrolizumab, 105mg SC every 4 weeks
Placebo SC every 4 weeks
Non-investigational medicinal products
Induction Phase Continuation of stable baseline doses of the following:
5-ASA (oral) ; AZA; 6-MP; MTX
Corticosteroids up to 30 mg/day of prednisone (or equivalent)
Bude sonide up to 9 mg/day
Maintenance Phase Responders who enter the Maintenance Phase should continue immunosuppressants (AZA, 
6-MP, MTX) at a stable dose unless dose reduction or discontinuation is required due to 
immunosuppressant -related toxicity . Generally accepted criteria for discontinuation of IS due to 
toxicity include but are not limited to acute pancreatitis, severe leukopenia, severe 
thrombocy topenia, or clinically significant elevations of the liver -associated enzy mes from 
baseline especially in the presence of an elevated total bilirubin.  The ultimate decision to 
reduce dose or discontinue IS due to toxicity remains at the discretion of the investigator.
During th e Maintenance Phase, patients receiving prednisone at a dose of 10 mg/day (or 
equivalent) are to have their dose reduced at a rate of 5 mg per week until a 10 mg/day dose is 
achieved.  Patients receiving prednisone at doses 10 mg/day  (or equivalent), o r once a 
10mg/day dose (or equivalent) is achieved by tapering, are to have their dose reduced at a rate 
of 2.5 mg/week until discontinuation.  Patients receiving budesonide are to taper their dose 
starting from Week 14 from 9 mg every day to 9 mg every o ther day for 2 weeks and then 
discontinue budesonide treatment.  For patients who cannot tolerate the corticosteroid taper 
without recurrence of clinical sy mptoms of either ulcerative colitis or corticosteroid withdrawal, 
corticosteroid dose may  be increas ed (up to the dose at study entry if required), but tapering 
must begin again within 2 weeks.

4.3.2 Dosage, A dministration, and Compliance
4.3.2.1 Etrolizu mab and Placebo
All patients will receive one 0.7 -mL injection with use of a PFS device once Q4 W.  The 
device is a 1 mL long glass syringe with a staked -in stainless steel needle.  
 
A part of the needle cap of the PFS may contain natural rubber latex that may cause 
allergic reactions in latex -sensitive individuals.
Study site HCPs will be trained on the use of the PFS device and SC administration of 
study medication into the thigh, abdomen, or upper arm.  Patients will in turn be trained 
in the use of the device by an HCP and an “Information for Use” leaflet .  In the event that 
a caregiver will ultimately administer study drug to the patient in the home setting, the 
caregiver is to be trained.  The upper arm site is to be used for caregiver and not patient 
administration of study treatment.
For the initial 4 dose administrations, study medication is to be administered under close 
supervision of the HCP in a setting where medications and resuscitation facilities are 
available.  The first two treatments (each 0.7 mL delivered via PFS; W eek 0 [Day 1] and 
Week4) will be ad ministered by the HCP and observed by the patient (and/or caregiver).  
The following two treatments (W eek 8 and Week 12) will be administered by the patient 
(or caregiver) and observed by the HCP in the clinic setting.   Following the first four 
study treat ment administrations, patients will be monitored for acute hypersensitivity 
reactions for at least one hour after the end of the injection.  Epinephrine must be readily 
available for immediate use if required to treat anaphylaxis. Adjunctive medications 
such as parenteral diphenhydramine and inhaled bronchodilators may be used IN 
ADDITION TO epinephrine if necessary.  Resuscitation equipment should also be 
available.   Site personnel must be able to detect and treat such reactions.

Etrolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd
65/Protocol GA28950, Version 8Patients with severe hype rsensitivity reactions (e.g., stridor, angioedema, life -threatening 
change in vital signs) must be withdrawn from study treatment.  These patients will not 
be eligible to receive open -label etrolizumab in Part 1(OLE) of Study GA28951 and are 
to enter the 12-week safety follow -up in this study followed by PML monitoring in Part 2
(SM)of Study GA28951 .
All adverse events of systemic hypersensitivity reactions or anaphylactoid or anaphylaxis 
reactions must be reported within 24 hours to the Sponsor and the Medical Monitor must 
be informed as soon as is practical (see the Study Manual for contact information).
Following the first four study drug administrations (W eeks 0 12),and therefore ,
completion of this first 3 -month period training in a clinical setting, study drug 
administration ( Week16 and then Q4 W onwards) will be continued in the home setting 
by the patient or a caregiver, if considered appropriate by the investigator.  Study 
medication will be administered in the patients’ home after return from the clinic visit .  
Patients and/or the caregiver will beprovided withcontact information for questio ns
related toself-administration between visits .  Competence of the patient or caregiver to 
administer at home will be documented.  Compliance inthehome setting is to be
monitored byuseofane-diary torecord drug administration andreturn ofused and 
unused medication syringes(see Appendix 7).  Patients and/or the caregiver will be 
provided with alert cards for themselves and a partner/caregiver, which they will be 
requested to carry at all times.  These will include guidanceonrecognizing
allergic/anaphyl actic/anaphylactoid reacti onsand how toobtain emergency care inthe
event such areaction occurs and information regarding recognition of symptoms of PML.
If the HCP/ patient cannot administer study medication on the scheduled dosing day, 
study medication is to be administered within a window of 3 days from the scheduled 
dosing date . If the patient experiences a minor illness (e.g., minor infection) , study 
medication may be delayed for a maximum period of 2 weeks. Following the delay ,
study medication dosing is to be resumed in accordance with the original dosing 
schedule. Any potential deviation from this window is to be discussed with the Medical 
Monitor for the s tudy.
If necessary, patients or their HCP may choose to continue administration of study 
medication in the clinic.
The recommended injection sites are the front of the middle thighs and the lower part of 
the abdomen below the navel except for the two inch area directly around the navel.  
Patients should place themselves in a comfortable position before self-administer ing
study drug.  As previously recommended, caregiver sresponsible for administering the 
injection should utilize the outer area of the upper arm,abdomen ,or thigh.  Injections 
should never be given into areas where the skin is not intact or is tender, bruised, red, 
orhard.  The injection sites will be inspected by the site personnel at each clinic visit.  
Any injection- site reactions (including those following an injection in the home setting)
Etrolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd
66/Protocol GA28950, Version 8(see Section 5.1.5 ) should be documented on the appropriate adverse event electronic 
Case Report Form (eCRF )page .Patients administering the injection at home should be 
taught to report any injection -site reactions as adverse events (e.g., redness and /or
swelling).
Guidelines for treatment interruption or discontinuation areprovided in Section s4.7
and 5.1.
4.3.2.2 Concomitant Background Treatment and Rescue Therapy
Patients entering the study may be refractory to, dependent on, or intolerant to
corticosteroids as defined below:
Corticos teroid refractory :  persistent symptoms of active disease despite history of 
at least one 4 -week induction regimen that included 30 mg prednisone (oral) daily

Corticosteroid intolerant :  history of intol erance to corticosteroids (including, but not 
limited to, Cushing’s Syndrome, osteopenia/osteoporosis, hyperglycemia, insomnia, 
or infection)
All patients are to be defined in the eCRF as refractory, dependent, or intolerant to 
corticosteroids , ifappropriate.  
In addition, patients entering the study may be refractory to or intolerant to
immunosuppressants defined as one or more of the following :
Persistent sig ns and symptoms of active disease despite a history of at least one 
12-week regimen of oral AZA ( 1.5 mg/kg) or 6 -MP (0.75 mg/kg) and/or MTX ( 15 
mg/week)
Persistent signs and symptoms of active disease despite a 6-TG level of 
230pmol/8 108RBCs during at least one 12 -week regimen of oral AZA or 6 -MP

immunosuppressants, if appropriate.
Management of Concomitant Medications during the Study
During Induction Phase (prior to Week 14)
Patients are required to maintain stable doses of their concomitant medications ( oral 
5-ASA, corticosteroids, immunosuppressants) for UC . 
Etrolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd
67/Protocol GA28950, Version 8During Maintenance Phase (after Week 14)
Corticosteroids
Corticosteroids are to be tapered starting from Week 14 in patients who achieve a 
clinical response (patient snot achieving clinical response will be a llowed to enroll in
Part 1 (OLE)of Study GA28951 .  Patients receiving prednisone at a dose of 10mg/day 
(or equivalent) are to have their dose reduced at a rate of 5 mg per week until 
a10mg/day dose is achieved.  Patients receiving prednisone at doses 10mg/day 
(orequivalent), or once a 10 mg/day dose (or equivalent) is achieved by tapering, are to 
have their dose reduced at a rate of 2.5 mg/week until discontinuation.  Patients 
receiving budesonide at study entry should taper their dose of 9 mg eve ry day to 9 mg 
every other day for 2 weeks and then discontinue budesonide treatment .  For patients 
who cannot tolerate the corticosteroid taper without recurrence of clinical symptoms of 
either UC or corticosteroid withdrawal, corticosteroid dose may be increased (up to the 
dose at study entry, if required), but tapering must begin again within 2 weeks.
Immunosuppressants
Patients should remain on their stable baseline doses of immunosuppressants (AZA, 
6-MP, MTX) th roughout the study unless dose reduction or discontinuation is required 
due to a toxi city related to the medication (see Section 3.1.1 for symptoms of toxicity to 
AZA, 6 -MP, or MTX).
Rescue Therapy  That Can Be Given with Study Medication for the 
Treatment of Ulcerative Colitis
Induction Phase
In the Induction Phase, any patient who requires initiation of an immunosuppressant
(AZA, 6 -MP, or MTX) ,oral or topical 5 -ASA, or corticosteroid, or increase in dose over 
baseline levels for treatment of worsening disease symptoms should stay in the study 
until W eek 14, at which time he or she should enroll in Part 1 (OLE) of Study GA28951 
to receive open- label etrolizumab, if eligible, or enter the 12- week safety follow -up.  
These patients may not continue into the Maintenance Phase of the study .  
Maintenance Phase (after Week 14)
Initiation or escalation of oral 5- ASA should be avoided but i s permitted if deemed 
clinically necessary by the investigator.  Patients who initiate or escalate oral 5 -ASA 
therapy may continue blinded treatment.
Use of topical or IV corticosteroids or topical 5 -ASA should also be avoided as 
concomitant medications.  However, if these are clinically required to treat symptoms of 
UC, then the patient may remain in this blinded phase of the study or be given the option 
to enroll in Part 1 (OLE) of Study GA28951 , if eligible, based on the investigator’s 
discretion .Patie nts who leave the treatment period early to enroll in Part 1 (OLE) of 
Study GA28951 should complete the early withdrawal from treatment visit prior to 
enrollment in Study GA28951 .
Etrolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd
68/Protocol GA28950, Version 8Patients who were not receiving corticosteroids at baseline and patients who have 
completed the corticosteroid taper who subsequently receive oral corticosteroids at a 
dose greater than 10 mg for 5 days or longer for the treatment of clinical symptoms of 
either UC or corticosteroid withdrawal may remain in this blinded phase of the study or 
be given the option to enroll in Part 1 (OLE) of Study GA28951 , if eligible, based on the 
investigator’s discretion.  Patients who leave the treatment period early to enroll in 
Part 1(OLE) of Study GA28951 should complete the early withdrawal from treatment 
visit prior to enrollment in Study GA28951 .
Endoscopy to document disease activity for all patients exiting the treatment period early 
is strongly recommended.
Immunosuppressants (A ZA, 6-MP, o r MTX) 
Patients are to remain on their stable baseline dose of immunosuppressant therapy 
throughout the study unless dose reduction or discontinuation is required because of 
toxicity.  Generally accepted criteria for discontinuation of immunosuppressants due to 
toxicity include but are not limited to acute pancreatitis, severe leukopenia, severe 
thrombocytopenia, or clinically significant elevations of the liver -associated enzymes 
from baseline, especially in the presence of an elevated total bilirubin.  The ultimate 
decision to reduce dose or discontinue immunosuppressants due to toxicity remains at 
the discretion of the investigator.  However, patients who do initiate or escalate 
immunosuppressant therapy may remain in this blinded phase of the study or be given 
the option to enroll in Part 1 (OLE) Study GA28951 , if eligible , based on the 
investigator’s discretion. Patients who leave the treatment period early to enroll in Part 1 
(OLE) of Study GA28951 should complete the early withdrawal from treatment visit prior 
to enrollment in Study GA28951 . Endoscopy to document disease activity for patients 
exiting the treatment period early for any reason is strongly recommended.
Rescue Therapy  That Cannot Be Given w ith Study  Medication for the 
Treatment of UC
AtANY time during the conduct of the trial, use of other immunosuppressive agents 
including but not limited to anti -integrins, T or B cell depleters (except AZA and 6 -MP), 
TNF inhibitors (including TNF inhibitor biosimilars ), cyclosporine, tacrolimus,
anti-adhesion molecules ,JAK inhibitors, or investigational agents are prohibited.  
Patients who receive such therapies are not to receive further study treatment or 
open -label treatment and will be required to enter 12 weeks of safety follow -up in this 
study ( see Appendix 2) .  After completion of safety follow -up, these patients will also be 
requested to enroll in Part 2 (SM)of Study GA28951 for 92weeks of extended PML 
monitoring.
4.3.3 Investigational Medicinal Product A ccountability
All investigational medicinal products (IMPs) required for completion of this study, 
namely, etrolizumab and etrolizumab placebo, will be provided by the Sponsor.  Th e 
investigator is responsible for the control of the drugs under investigation.  The 
Etrolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd
69/Protocol GA28950, Version 8investigational site will acknowledge receipt of IMP (e.g., drug receipt record) and 
disposition (e.g., drug dispensing log).  Accountability will be assessed by maintaini ng 
adequate drug dispensing and return records.  IxRS will be used to confirm the shipment 
condition and content.  Any damaged shipments will be replaced.
Accurate records must be kept for all study drug provided by the Sponsor.
These records must contain the following:
Documentation of drug shipments received from the Sponsor (date received and 
quantity)
Disposition of unused study drug not dispensed to patients 
Drug Dispensing Log must be kept current and should contain the following 
information:
Identif ication of the patient to whom the study medication was dispensed
Date(s) and quantity of the study medication dispensed tothe patient
Date(s) and quantity of the unused study medication returned bythe patient
All records and drug supplies must be avail able for inspection by the study monitor.
4.3.4 Assessment of Compliance
Patient compliance will be assessed by maintaining adequate drug dispensing logs, the 
patient e -diary, and return records.
Home -injection:  An e- diary will be provided to patients to record home injections.
Patients will be asked to return all unused PFS sin the provided boxes at each visit as a 
measure of drug accountability and patient compliance.  Site personnel will monitor the 
medication records from the e -diary via an online portal. Patients should also bring their 
e-diary to the clinic during visit.
Sharps containers for any used PFS swill be provided locally to patients for home usage.  
After home injections, the used syringes must be placed into the sharps containers 
immediately.  T he sharps containers should be returned to sites.  Sharps containers will 
be discarded by the site staff at the frequency per local schedule.
A Drug Dispensing Log must be kept as described in Section 4.3.3 .  The investigator is 
responsible for ensuring that dosing is administered in compliance with the protocol.  
Delegation of this task must be clearly documented and approved by the inv estigator.   
When the study is completed, the investigator will return all completed Drug Dispensing 
Logs to the Monitors.
Any unused study drug and Drug Return Records should be returned to the Monitor, 
unless alternate destruction has been authorized by R oche or required by local or 
Etrolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd
70/Protocol GA28950, Version 8institutional regulations (Section 4.3.3 ).  The investigator's copy of the Drug Return 
Record(s) must accurately document the return of all study drug supplies to Sponsor.
4.3.5 Destruction of the Investigational Medicinal 
Product/Comparator
Any used PFS will be placed into sharps containers immediately after SC injections 
either at site or at home.  The sharps containers should be discarded at the study site by 
the site staff per local schedule.  Written documentation of destruction of unused study 
drug must contain the following:
Identity (batch numbers or subject numbers) of IMP(s) destroyed
Quantity of IMP(s) destroyed
Date of destruction
Method of destruction
Name and signature of responsible person who destroyed investigational product(s).
In case of device failure or if there are any issues with the drug, the PFS should not be 
destroyed and instead should be returned to the investigator site in the packaging 
provided for this purpose.  The device is to be sent from the investigator site to the 
appropriate Roche clinical trial supplies department for further assessment 
(see Section 4.3.6 ).
4.3.6 Reporting of Prefilled Sy ringe Complaints/Events
The investigator should report all medical device complaints to the Sponsor.  The 
investigator must document as much information as possible on the PD103 IMP 
Deviation F orm, including product batch number and expiration date, and forward the 
complaint form to the Sponsor within 24 hours of the investigator becoming aware of the 
event.  PD103 IMP Deviation Form, together with pictures of the defective PFS, should 
be sent to kaiseraugst.global_impcomplaint_management@roche.com.
Where possible, the investigator will retrieve the PFS unit(s) involved in the complaint 
and attempt to return it to the Sponsor for further assessment, if necessary.
If the medical device complaint results in an adverse event, an Adverse Event eCRF 
must be completed and submitted through the electronic data capture (EDC) system 
immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event).  If the event is 
serious, the Adverse Event eCRF must be completed and submitted through the EDC 
immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event), as outlined in 
Section 5.4.2 . If the medical device complaint results in an adverse event to an 
individual other than the study patient, the device complaint must be reported on the 
PD103 IMP Deviation Form and the adverse event must be reported as a spontaneous 
adverse event to the Sponsor via telephone .

Etrolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd
72/Protocol GA28950, Version 84.6 STUDY ASSESSMENTS 
4.6.1 Description of Study  Assessments
4.6.1.1 Medical History  and Demographic Data
Medical history includes clinically significant diseases, procedures, and all medication 
taken in the 8 weeks prior to Day 1 (including prescription, over -the-counter, and 
herbal/homeopathic remedi es and therapies).  A detailed history of medication used for 
UC is required for the 5 years prior to screening.  Patients will be categorized as TNF 
inhibitor refractory, TNF inhibitor intolerant, or neither refractory nor intolerant to TNF 
inhibitors at screening (see definitions in Section 4.1.1 ).
Demographic data , including age, sex, whether the patient is a fraternal or identical t win, 
and self -reported race/ethnicity , will be collected during screening.
4.6.1.2 Physical Examinations
A complete physical examination should include the evaluation of head, eye, ear, nose, 
and throat, and cardiovascular, dermatological, musculoskeletal, respiratory, GI, and 
neurological systems, including administration of the PML Subjective Checklist andthe 
PML Objective Checklist by the investigator (see Appendix 5for PML assessment 
details and Appendix 6for PML algorithm).  New or worsened abnormalities from 
screening should be recorded as adverse events ,if appropriate.  In addition, a 
symptom -driven examination shou ld be conducted as indicated in the Schedule of 
Assessments.
4.6.1.3 Vital Signs
Vital signs will include measurement of heart rate and systolic and diastolic blood 
pressure, after the patient has been in a seated position for 5 minutes, and are to be 
recorded bef ore study drug administration at the indicated timepoints in Schedule of 
Assessments (see Appendix 1).
4.6.1.4 Ulcerative Colitis Disease Activity  Assessments
Extent and duration of patient’s disease areto be recorded on the eCRF from the patient 
medical records and should include therapies from the last 5 years.  Extent of disease 
should be defined as follows: 1) left -sided colitis (up to the splenic flexure), 2) extensive 
colitis (beyond the splenic flexure but not involving the entire colon), and 3) pancolitis.
All measurable disease must be documented at screening and re -assessed at each 
subsequent evaluation.  Responses will be assessed by the investigator or designee 
with use of the MCS and pMCS.  The MCS has a range of 0 12, whereas pMCS has 
range 0 9, with higher scores indicating more severe disease.  MCS is a composite of 
four assessments, each rated from 0 3:  stool frequency, rect
al bleeding, endoscopy , 
and PGA .  pMCS is a composite of three assessments, each rated from 0 3:  stool
frequency, rectal bleeding, and PGA .
Etrolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd
73/Protocol GA28950, Version 8During screening, patients will be instructed on how to appropriately use and complete 
questions on the e- diary.  T he patients’ normal number of stools is to be recorded.  This 
is defined as the number of stools passed when a patient is in remission, not in flare.  
This is to be taken from the most recent available data in the patient’s medical notes or 
taken during pa tient interview at screening.
One of the components of the MCS is the endoscopic subscore.  The time window for 
performing endoscopy during the screening is 416days prior to Day 1 (i.e., Day 16to 
Day4).  Medical Monitor approval is not required for endoscopies conducted within 
this window.   Under no circumstances will an endoscopy be accepted more than 16 
days or less than 4 days prior to Day 1.  Note that the total screening period is up to 35 
days (see Section 4.6.2.1) . 
The symptoms of UC must be recorded throughout the study, including the screening 
period.  The e -diary entries will be reviewed by site personnel during screening (prior to 
dosing, if applicable) and during study visits ,including the early withdrawal from 
treatment visit and any unscheduled visit(s) due to disease exacerbation.  Because the 
colonoscopy/flexible sigmoidoscopy and bowel cleansing preparations can interfere wit h 
the assessment of patient -reported symptoms , e-diary entries used to calculate the 
complete MCS should not correspond to day sof bowel preparation orendoscopy or the 
day following the endoscopy.  Further details and examples of stool frequency and recta l 
bleeding subscore derivation are provided in Appendix 3.  Appendix 3also outlines 
procedures to follow in the event of e- diary malfunction or loss .
Colonoscopy /Flexible Sigmoidoscopy  with Colonic Biopsies
Patients are to prepare their bowel prior to the colonoscopy/flexible sigmoidoscopy 
procedures.  Medications used for bowel preparation should be recorded on concomitant 
medications pages of eCRF.
Stool samples for analysis of fecal calprotectin and other exploratory biomarkers (such 
as analyses of the microbiota and bacterial cultures) are to be coll ected prior to bowel 
preparation (polyethylene glycol [ PEG] based preparation or enema).
Full colonoscopy within a year of screening is required to ensure against enrollment of 
patients with colonic carcinoma and dysplasia.  If full colonoscopy has not bee n 
performed within the year before screening, it should be conducted in place of the 
flexible sigmoidoscopy at screening.  For patients not requiring a colonoscopy, a flexible 
sigmoidoscopy will be performed on all patients for inclusion in the study.  Endoscopy
will be performed during screening 416 days prior to Day 1 .
Endoscopy will be also performed at Weeks 14 and 66 and/or withdrawal from study
(early withdrawal from treatment visit, see Appendix 1).  
Etrolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd
74/Protocol GA28950, Version 8Central reading of endoscopies will be performed throughout this study, and a detailed 
charter will address the standardization of endoscopic procedures, video recordings and 
equipment, as well as the criteria for endoscopic assessment. For each patient, video 
recording of the entire endoscopic procedure will be performed as specified in the Video 
Submission Guidelines .  All video recordings will be edited by the central read vendor to 
produce video clips that are representative of each segment of the colon visualized up to 
the splenic flexure only (rectum, sigmoid, and descending colon).  The video clips will be 
read centrally for mucosal lesions and endoscopic severity by an independen t 
gastroenterologist experienced in IBD who is blind to the patient’s clinical activity and 
treatment allocation.  TheMCSendoscopic subscore is to be determined both locally (at 
the investigator site) and centrally as described above. Each segment of th e colon up to 
the splenic flexure (rectum, sigmoid and descending colon) will be assigned an 
endoscopic subscore .  The score from the worst affected segment up to the splenic 
flexure is to be used for the MCS calculation for study conduct , except at post-baseline 
time points, when the sigmoid colon MCS endoscopic subscore will be used if the 
baseline sigmoid colon MCS endoscopic subscore is 2 3.
In the event that there is a discrepancy between the endoscopic subscore obtained by 
the local versus th e central reader , a third read (performed by a second central reader) 
is to be conducted.   From these three endoscopic MCS subscores, the score with which 
two readers agree will be reported as the final overall MCS endoscopic subsco re. If no 
tworeaders agree on a MCS endoscopic subscore, the median score of the three 
completed reads (i.e., local read, central read #1 ,and central read #2) will be chosen as 
the final reported overall MCS endoscopic subscore.
In all cases the video recordings are to be taken prior to biopsy .
Each patient entered into the study will have colonic biopsies obtained during flexible 
sigmoidoscopy/full colonoscopy as follows:
At Screening
A total of five to six paired biopsy samples (10 to 12samples ) will be taken at sc reening.
Five paired biopsy samples (10 samples ) from the most inflamed area of the colon 
within 2040cm from the anal verge (sigmoid colon) .  Three pairs (6 samples ) will 
go into fo rmalin and two pairs (4 samples ) will be placed in stabilization buffer (such 
as RNAlater or a similar buffer) and be shipped to a central laboratory for storage 
at80C.In UK sites ONLY, oneof the latter pair of biopsies (2samples) will be 
placed in storage solution at 4°C and shipped to the UK laboratory .
ONLY if there is suspicion for clinically significant CMV colitis, o ne biopsy sample
should be taken from the base of an ulcer to evaluate for histological presence of 
CMV,but otherwise is not necessary for inclusion in the study .  Analysis should be 
performed locally i f possible or can be sent to a central lab if necessary. 
Etrolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd
75/Protocol GA28950, Version 8Only if histopathologic confirmation of UC is needed to meet study eligibility, an 
additional biopsy sample can be used for histopathologic confirmation of UC if 
necessary (analysis should be performed locally if possible, or can be sent to a 
central lab if necessary) .
If neither CMV testing or histopathologic confirmation of UC is n eeded, these 
additional 2 biopsy samples should not be obtained.
At Weeks 14 and 66 and/or at early  withdra wal from treatment visit 
(see Appendix 1) 
Four paired biopsy samples (8 samples ) will be obtained at subsequent visits, as 
specified in Appendix 1.  Four paired biopsy samples (8 samples ) are to be taken 
from the most inflamed area of the colon within 20 40 cm from the anal verge 
(sigmoid colon, approximately at the same endoscopic depth of the original 
screening endoscopy).  If there is no clearly inflamed area, a blind biopsy should be 
taken.  Two pairs will go into formalin and two pairs will be placed in stabilization 
buffer (such as RNAlater or a similar buffer) and shipped to a cen tral laboratory for 
storage at 80C(see Appendix 1).  In UK sites ONLY, one of the latter pair of 
biopsies (2 samples) will be placed in storage solution at 4°C and shipped to the 
UKlaboratory .  
Necrotic areas of ulcerated mucosa should be avoided during biopsy.  Original location 
(colonic segment and endoscopic depth) of biopsy specimen should be clearly indicated.  
Samples will all initially be sent to the laboratory vendor (unless analysis is to be 
performed locally, as indicated).
Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy Assessment
Study site personnel and patient swill be educated regarding the signs and symptoms of 
PML.  Close monitoring during the course of the study for any new symptoms or signs 
suggestive of PML will be performed , with regular neurologic exam inations (including 
evaluation of cranial nerves, motor and sensory function, coordination, and mental status) 
as per t he Schedule of Assessments (see Appendix 1).  The PML Subjective Checklist 
(symptom assessment) and the PML Objective Checklist (neurologic evaluation) will be 
administered (Appendix 5)by a qualified HCP and will be performed at screening and as 
indicated on the Schedule of Assessments.
During the in- clinic visits, patients will undergo PML monitoring assessments.
If a patient has a positive finding on the PML Subjective Checklist that i s accompanied 
by a positive finding on the PML Objective Checklist or if there is strong clinical suspicion 
for PML,  the event should be expeditiously reported as an adverse event of special 
interest within 24 hours (see Section 5.2.3 )(see Appendix 6for the Algorithm for 
Evaluation of Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy [PML]).  If PML is suspected, 
dosing with study treatment for that patient will be suspended and the patient sho uld be 
promptly referred to a neurologist.  Following formal evaluation by a neurologist, if PML 
cannot be ruled out, the case will be referred to an expert PML adjudication committee 
Etrolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd
76/Protocol GA28950, Version 8for further work -up, which may include brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 
performed with and without contrast.  If there remains any suspicion for PML, the PML 
adjudication committee may recommend performing a lumbar puncture with 
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis for John Cunningham virus (JCV) by PCR.  If JCV is 
detecte d, the patient should be treated as a PML case, permanently discontinue study 
drug, and transfer to safety follow -up. 
Dosing with study treatments can only be resumed in patients where PML has been 
ruled out.  See Appendix 6for the Algorithm for Evaluation of Progressive Multifocal 
Leukoencephalopathy (PML).
After completing this study, patients not enrolling in Part 1 (OLE) of Study GA28951 to 
receive treatment with open- label etrolizumab will enter the12-week safety follow -upin 
this study (see Appendix 2).  The PML examination isto be performed at W eek 12 of this 
safety follow -up.
Following 12- week safety follow -up, all patients will be requested to continue to be 
monitored for PML for an additional 92 weeks by enrolling in Part 2 ( SM)of 
Study GA28951 , thus,providing a total of 2 years PML follow -up after the last dose of 
study medication.  During Part 2 (SM) of Study GA28951 , patients will not be 
administered study drug.
The PML extended f ollow -up period in the Study GA28951 (OLE-SM) will consist of the 
PML assessment interview conducted by telephone at 6- month intervals .
4.6.1.5 Laboratory  Assessments
Laboratory assessments will be performed as indicated on the Schedule of 
Assessments; see the Study Flowchart in Appendix 1.  All laborat ory investigations will 
be sent to one or more central laboratories for analysis with the exception of CMV .If 
there is suspicion for clinically significant CMV colitis , a colonic biopsy should be sent for 
CMV evaluation , which may be conducted locally de pending on local requirements for 
the timing of the test result .  Urine pregnancy testing will be conducted locally or in the 
home setting. If a full colonoscopy is required at screening, laboratory samples should 
be drawn prior to the initiation of bowel preparation.
Ondays of study drug administration, laboratory samples should be drawn before the 
administration of study drug.  Laboratory assessments will include the following:
Hematology (hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelet count, RBC count, WBC count, 
absolute differential count [neutrophils, eosinophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, 
basophils, other cells] ,	mean corpuscular volume, mean corpuscular hemoglobin, 
mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, and RBC distribution width)
Etrolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd

Urinalysis
Tuberculosis
The PPD skin test and QuantiFERONTB Gold are acceptable screening 
assays for latent Mycobacterium TB infection. 
A positive PPD tuberculin skin test reaction is considered 5 mm.
Patients with a history of bacille Calmette -Guérin (BCG) vaccination should be 
screened using the QuantiFERON-TB Gold test only .
An indeterminate QuantiFERON -TB Gold test should be repeated.   The 
follow -up test can be either a repeat of the previous test or a PPD tuberculin 
skin test in patients who are eligible to have a PPD tuberculin skin test 
performed .
The patient is considered to have a positive diagnostic test for TB if at least 
one of the following circumstances applies:
–A positive QuantiFERON -TB Gold test
–Two successive indeterminate QuantiFERON -TB Gold tests
–A positive PPD tuberculin skin test
The patient is considered to have a negative diagnostic test for TB if at least 
one of the following circumstances applies:
–A negative QuantiFERON -TB Gold test
–A negative PPD tuberculin skin test
If a negative TB screening test has been documented within 3 months of 
screening, no new test is needed.
C-reactive protein (CRP)
C. difficile toxin assay in stool, stool culture and sensitivity testing, stool ova and 
parasites analysis
Pregnancy test:  All women of childbearing potential (including those who have had 
a tubal ligation) will have a serum pregnancy test at screening.
Urine pregnancy tests will be performed at specified subsequent visits.  If a 
urine pregnancy test result is positive, it must be confirmed by a serum 
pregnancy test.

78/Protocol GA28950, Version 8Viral serology and detection
HBV (HBsAg, total HB core antibody [anti -HBc] and HBV DNA)
HCV antibody
Measurement of HCV RNA with use of the Amplicor assay is required when the 
patient has a known history of HCV antibody positivity with past documentation 
of undetectable HCV RNA, either with or without history of anti -viral treatment.  
Patients with newly diagnosed HCV antibody positivity are not eligible for this 
study and, therefore, do not require measurement of HCV RNA.
HIV
ATA assays
Serum samples will be collected for the detection and characterization of 
antibodies against etrolizumab in all patients.  Samples will be analyzed using 
validated assays .  For ATA samples without matched PK determinations, 
etrolizumab concentrations may be measured for the purpose of helping 
interpret ATA data.   ATA samples may also be utilized for exploratory PD 
biomarkers.
JCV antibodies
A blood sample to test for antibodies to JCV will be taken and stored for 
possible later assessment of how widespread the JCV infection is in the study 
population.  Sample testing for the presence of JCV antibodies is not helpful in 
predicting risk for PML or for evaluating neurologic symptoms.  The sample 
may be tested if there is a strong belief that this information will be helpful in 
managing a patient's condition.
PK assays
Serum samples will be collected for determination of etrolizumab 
concentrations in all patients during the Induction Phase and in all patients who 
were randomized into the Maintenance Phase.  Samples will be analyzed using 
a validated assay .
CMV testing of colonic biopsy , if there is suspicion for clinically significant CMV 
colitis 
Baseline colon biopsy (to be obtained at the base of the ulcer) will be analyzed 
for histologic presence of CMV
Fecal c alprotectin
Exploratory diagnostic biomarker assays
Peripheral blood, serum ,stool, and colon biopsies will be assessed using 
qualified methods (including but not limited to ELISA, IHC, and/or qPCR) for 
exploratory anddiagnostic biomarker analysis.
 Histologic activity on colon biopsies using the Nancy histologi cal index.
Etrolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd
79/Protocol GA28950, Version 8Exploratory PD biomarker assays
Peripheral blood, serum, stool ,and colon biopsies will be collected and 
qualified methods (including but not limited to ELISA, IHC, bacterial culture ,
and/or qPCR) will be utilized for exploratory PD biomarker analysis for samples 
that are assessed. Biopsy tissue may also be used for exploratory 
determination of drug concentration. Stool samples may be used for
assessments that include, but are not limited to, analyses of the microbiota and 
bacterial cultures .
Unless the patient gives specific consent for his or her leftover samples to be stored for 
optional exploratory research (see Section 4.6.1.10 ), biological samples will be 
destroyed when the final Clinical Study Report has been completed, with the following 
exceptions:
Serum samples collected for PK or immunogenicity analysis may be needed for 
additional immunogenicity characterization and for PK orimmunogenicity assay 
development and validation; therefore, these samples will be destroyed no later than 
5 years after the final Clinical Study Report has been completed.
Blood samples (RNA Paxgene, serum for exploratory PD) and stool samples 
collected for biomarker research will be destroyed no later than 5 years after the 
final Clinical Study Report has been completed.
Colon biopsy samples (formalin and RNA later) will be destroyed no later than 
5years after the final Clinical Study Report has been completed.
4.6.1.6 Chest X -Ray
A chest X -ray will be performed at screening.  If a chest X -ray has been documented 
within the previous 3 months and has shown no clinically significant abnormalities, no 
additional chest X -ray is required.
4.6.1.7 Electrocardiograms
Electrocardiograms (ECGs) for each patient should be obtained from the same machine 
whenever possible.  To minimize variability, it i s important that patients be in a resting 
position for 10minutes prior to each ECG evaluation.  Body position should be 
consistently maintained for each ECG evaluation to prevent changes in heart rate.  
Environmental distractions (e.g., television, radi o, conversation) should be avoided 
during the pre -ECG resting period and during ECG recording.  ECGs should be 
performed prior to meals and any scheduled vital sign measurements and blood draws.
For safety monitoring purposes, the investigator or designee must review, sign, and date 
all ECG tracings.  Paper copies will be kept as part of the patient's permanent study file 
at the site.  ECG outputs will be stored at site.
Etrolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd
80/Protocol GA28950, Version 84.6.1.8 Patient -Reported Outcomes
Patient -reported outcomes (IBDQ, UC -PRO/SS, EQ -5D, and the st ool frequency and 
rectal bleeding components of the MCS and pMCS) and physician -reported outcomes 
(PGA of the MCS and pMCS) and the endoscopic component of MCS data will be 
collected to help characterize the clinical profile of etrolizumab.  The instrument s will be 
translated as required in the local language.
In order to ensure instrument validity and that data standards meet health authority 
requirements, the PROs completed at the sites (IBDQ, EQ -5D, and the stool frequency 
and rectal bleedi ng components of the MCS and pMCS) should be administered at the 
investigational site prior to the completion of other non -PRO assessments and before 
the patient receives any disease -status information or study drug during that visit.  At 
Week0 (Day 1), however, IBDQ and EQ -5D do not have to be performed prior to 
non-PRO assessments.  Patients will complete the UC -PRO/SS measure for at least 
912 consecutive days around the time of each scheduled visit, as programmed in the 
e-diary .
PRO data will be collected electronic ally using electronic patient -reported outcome 
(ePRO) devices (i.e., e -diary or tablet ).  The format of the questionnaires may change 
when they are converted to electronic format.  Electronic data captured by the patient 
since the previous study visit should be reviewed with the patient at each clinic visit.  
ePRO data will be collected and assessed at visits according to the Schedule of 
Assessments in Appendix 1.
Ulcerative Colitis Patient -Reported Outcomes Signs and Sy mptoms 
(UCPRO/SS) Measure
The UC -PRO/SS measure will be used to assess patient -reported UC signs and 
symptoms.  The 14 -item questionnaire (some questions contain supplementary 
questions regarding severity/frequency) contains three domains:  bowel movement signs 
and symptoms, abdominal symptoms, and systemic symptoms.  The UC -PRO/SS 
assesses the presence of UC symptoms and in some cases the severity or frequency of 
the symptoms.  The UC -PRO/SS measure has a recall specification of 24 hours.  A copy 
of the UC PRO/SS measure is provided in Appendix 9.
Inflammatory  Bowel Disease Questionnaire 
The IBDQ will be used to assess patients’ health -related QOL ( Guyatt et al. 1989 ; 
Irvine 1999 ).  The 32 -item questionnaire contains four domains: bowel symptoms 
(10items), systemic sy mptoms (5 items), emotional function (12 items), and social 
function (5 items).  The items are scored on a 7 -point Likert scale with a higher score 
indicating better health- related QOL.  The IBDQ has a recall specification of 2 weeks.  
Acopy of the IBDQ i s provided in Appendix 10.
Etrolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd
81/Protocol GA28950, Version 8Mayo Clinic Score (MCS) and Partial May o Clinic Score (pMCS)
The MCS is a composite of four assessments, each rated from 0 3:  stool frequency, 
rectal bleeding, endoscopy, and PGA (Schroeder et al. 1987 ).  The endoscopy subscore 
of the MCS is derived from an evaluation of findings on endoscopy and as determined 
by the central reading proced ure described in Section 4.6.1.4.  The pMCS is a 
composite of three assessments, each rated from 0 3:  stool frequency, rectal bleeding, 
and PGA .  The MCS has a range of 0 12 and the pMCS has a range of 0 9.  Higher 
scores indicate more severe disease.  Copies of the MCS and pMCS are provided in 
Appendix 3.
EuroQol Five -Dimension Questionnaire
The EQ -5D is a generic preference- based health -related QOL questionnaire that 
provides a single index value for health status ( Rabin and DeCharro 2001 ).  This tool 
includes questions about mobility, self -
care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and 
anxiety/depression that are used to build a composite of the patient’s health status.  The 
EQ-5D questionnaire will be utilized in this study for economic modeling.  A copy of the 
assessment is provided in Appendix 11.
4.6.1.9 Medication Use and Compliance
Following each home administration of study medication, the patient is to record the 
location of each injection and whether the injection was successfully admin istered.  The 
e-diary will automatically collect date and time information for when the patient
completes the study medication administration report.  Note that details of the study 
medication administration are to be entered directly into the eCRF followi ng clinic 
administrations.
4.6.1.10 Samples for Roche Clinical Repository
Overview  of the Roche Clinical Repository
The Roche Clinical Repository (RCR) is a centrally administered group of facilities for 
the long -term storage of human biologic specimens, including body fluids, solid tissues, 
and derivatives thereof (e.g., DNA, RNA, proteins, peptides).  The collection and 
analysis of RCR specimens will facilitate the rational design of new pharmaceutical 
agents and the development of diagnostic tests, which may allow for individualized drug 
therapy for patients in the future.
Specimens for the RCR will be collected from patients who give specific consent to 
participate in this optional research.  In addition, any residual colonic biopsy and blood 
samples for biomarkers left over at the end of the study and analyses will be transferred 
to the RCR in consenting patients.  RCR specimens will be used to achieve the following 
objectives:
To study the association of biomarkers with efficacy, adverse events, or disease 
progr ession
To increase knowledge and understanding of disease biology
Etrolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd
82/Protocol GA28950, Version 8To study drug response, including drug effects and the processes of drug absorption 
and disposition
To develop biomarker or diagnostic assays and establish the performance 
characteristics of these assays
Approval by the Institutional Review Board or Ethics Committee
Sampling for the RCR is contingent upon the review and approval of the exploratory 
research and the RCR portion of the Informed Consent Form by each site's Institutional 
Review Board or Ethics Committee (IRB/EC) and, if applicable, an appropriate 
regulatory body.  If a site has not been granted approval for RCR sampling, this section 
of the protocol will not be applicable at that site.
Sample Collection
Whole blood (DNA) will be c ollected for genetic analysis from consenting patients (RCR 
Informed Consent Form).
Samples that are obtained for exploratory analysis of biomarkers (listed below) but were 
not utilized or were not entirely consumed will be transferred to the RCR.
Specimen types include the following:
Blood collected in RNA Paxgene tubes (for exploratory PD; see Appendix 1for 
specific collection timepoint s)
Serum for exploratory PD (see Appendix 1for specific collection timepoints)
Stool samples may be used for exploratory biomarker analy ses ( see Appendix 1for 
specific collection timepoints)
Colon biopsy samples (formalin and stabilization buffer [such as RNAlater or a 
similar buffer]; see Appendix 1for specific collection timepoints)
Potential applications of RCR samples include these samples being a ssayed for mRNA 
expression, genetic variation, and other biomarker(s) that predict response or toxicity to 
etrolizumab.
For all samples, dates of consent and specimen collection should be recorded on the 
associated RCR page of the eCRF.  For sampling proce dures, storage conditions, and 
shipment instructions, see the Reference Manual or Laboratory Manual.
RCR specimens will be destroyed no later than 15 years after the date of final closure of 
the associated clinical database.  The RCR storage period will be in accordance with the 
IRB/EC -approved Informed Consent Form and applicable laws (e.g., health authority 
requirements).
The dynamic biomarker specimens will be subject to the confidentiality standards 
described in Section 8.4.  The genetic biomarker specimens will undergo additional 
processes to ensure confidentiality, as described below.
Etrolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd
83/Protocol GA28950, Version 8Confidentiality
Given the sensitive nature of ge netic data, Roche has implemented additional processes 
to ensure patient confidentiality for RCR specimens and associated data.  Upon receipt 
by the RCR, each specimen is "double -coded" by replacing the patient identification 
number with a new independent number.  Data generated from the use of these 
specimens and all clinical data transferred from the clinical database and considered 
relevant are also labeled with this same independent number.  A "linking key" between 
the patient identification number and this new independent number is stored in a secure 
database system.  Access to the linking key is restricted to authorized individuals and is 
monitored by audit trail.  Legitimate operational reasons for accessing the linking key are 
documented in a standard operating procedure.  Access to the linking key for any other 
reason requires written approval from the Pharma Repository Governance Committee 
and Roche's Legal Department, as applicable.
Data generated from RCR specimens must be available for inspection upon request by 
representatives of national and local health authorities, and Roche monitors, 
representatives, and collaborators, as appropriate.
Patient medical information associated with RCR specimens is confidential and may only 
be disclosed to third parties as permitted by the Informed Consent Form (or separate 
authorization for use and disclosure of personal health information) signed by the patient, 
unless permitted or required by law.
Data derived from RCR specimen analysis on individual patients w ill generally not be 
provided to study investigators unless a request for research use is granted.  The 
aggregate results of any research conducted using RCR specimens will be available in 
accordance with the effective Roche policy on study data publicatio n.
Any inventions and resulting patents, improvements, and/or know -how originating from 
the use of the RCR data will become and remain the exclusive and unburdened property 
of Roche, except where agreed otherwise.
Consent to Participate in the Roche Clinic al Repository
The Informed Consent Form will contain a separate section that addresses participation 
in the RCR.  The investigator or authorized designee will explain to each patient the 
objectives, methods, and potential hazards of participation in the RCR.  Patients will be 
told that they are free to refuse to participate and may withdraw their specimens at any 
time and for any reason during the storage period.  A separate, specific signature will be 
required to document a patient's agreement to provide o ptional RCR specimens.  
Patients who decline to participate will not provide a separate signature.
Etrolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd
84/Protocol GA28950, Version 8The investigator should document whether or not the patient has given consent to 
participate by completing the RCR Research Sample Informed Consent eCRF.
In the event of an RCR participant's death or loss of competence, the participant's 
specimens and data will continue to be used as part of the RCR research.
Withdrawal from the Roche Clinical Repository
Patients who give consent to provide RCR specimens have the right to withdraw their 
specimens from the RCR at any time for any reason.  If a patient wishes to withdraw 
consent to the testing of his or her specimens, the investigator must inform the Medical 
Monitor in writing of the patient's wishes using the RC R Subject Withdrawal Form and, if 
the trial is ongoing, must enter the date of withdrawal on the RCR Research Sample 
Withdrawal of Informed Consent eCRF.  The patient will be provided with instructions on 
how to withdraw consent after the trial is closed. A patient's withdrawal from 
Study GA28950 does not, by itself, constitute withdrawal of specimens from the RCR.  
Likewise, a patient's withdrawal from the RCR does not constitute withdrawal from 
Study GA28950.
Monitoring and Oversight
RCR specimens will b e tracked in a manner consistent with Good Clinical Practice by a 
quality -controlled, auditable, and appropriately validated laboratory information 
management system to ensure compliance with data confidentiality as well as 
adherence to authorized use of s pecimens as specified in this protocol and in the 
Informed Consent Form.  Roche monitors and auditors will have direct access to 
appropriate parts of records relating to patient participation in the RCR for the purposes 
of verifying the data provided to Roche.  The site will permit monitoring, audits, IRB/EC 
review, and health authority inspections by providing direct access to source data and 
documents related to the RCR samples.
4.6.2 Timing of Study  Assessments
4.6.2.1 Screening and Pretreatment A ssessments
Written in formed consent for participation in the study must be obtained before 
performing any study -specific screening tests or evaluations.  Informed Consent Forms 
for enrolled patients and for patients who are not subsequently enrolled will be 
maintained at the s tudy site.
All screening tests and evaluations will be performed within 35days prior to Day 1 
except for flexible sigmoidoscopy/colonoscopy which should be performed 416days 
prior to Day 1 (see Figure 4). The screening period will not exceed 35 calendar days.
Etrolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd
85/Protocol GA28950, Version 8Laboratory samples should be collected from the patient early in the screening period to 
allow time for the laboratory res ults to be available for review by the site for eligibility
(seeSection 4.6.1.5).   The ECG and chest X -ray can be obtained any time before Day 1
(see Section 4.6.1.6 and4.6.1.7 for additional details on the chest X -ray and ECG).   
Colon biopsy specimen collection is detailed in Section 4.6.1.4.
A blood sample to test for antibodies to JCV will be taken and stored for possible later 
assessment of how widespread the JCV infection is in the study population.  Sample 
testing for the presence of JCV antibodies is not helpful in predicting risk for PML or for 
evaluating neurologic symptoms.  The sample may be tested if there is a strong belief 
that this information will be helpful in managing a patient's condition.
The screening endoscopy f or MCS should be performed 4 16 days prior to Day 1 
(i.e., Day16  to Day 4; see Figure 4).  The endoscopy score from the worst aff ected 
segment up to the splenic flexure (rectum, sigmoid, and descending colon) is to be used 
for the MCS calculation (see Section 4.6.1.4 ).
The symptoms of UC must be recorded during the screening period.  The e -diary entries 
will be reviewed by site personnel during screening.  Because the colonoscopy/flexible 
sigmoidoscopy and bowel cleansing preparations can interfere with the assess ment of 
patient -reported symptoms, e- diary entries used to calculate the complete MCS should 
not correspond to days of bowel preparation or endoscopy or the day following the 
endoscopy.  Further details and examples of stool frequency and rectal bleeding 
subscore derivation are provided in Appendix 3.
The endoscopy and the stool frequency and rectal bleeding subscores will be 
considered, along with other PGA components, when determining the PGA for the MCS 
calculation at Day 1 (i.e., prior to initiation of study drug),
 as described in detail in 
Appendix 3.
Etrolizumab —F.Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd
86/Protocol GA28950, Version 8Figure 4Overview  of Screening A ctivities
Note:  Endoscopy should be performed 4 16 day s prior to Day 1 .
All screening evaluations must be completed and reviewed to confirm that patients meet 
all eligibility criteria before Day 1.  The investigator will maintain a screening log to 
record details of all patients screened and to confirm eligibility or record r easons for 
screening failure, as applicable.
4.6.2.1.1 Re-Testing for Laboratory  Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria
Two re-tests are permitted for laboratory inclusion and exclusion criteria. If a patient 
does not meet laboratory criteria for a third time, he or she will be considered a screen 
failure.  
Laboratory testing that is repeated because of administrative or technical issues 
(e.g., breakage of a sample vial during transit to the central laboratory or degradation of 
a sample during transportation) i s not considered to be re-screening.
4.6.2.1.2 Re-Screening
Re-screening is required if a patient has not met all the eligibility criteria within 35days 
of the original screening visit.  Patients who are found to be ineligible for entry into the 
study may be re -screened once only for example, if the patient develops additional 
manifestations of UC, a worsening of existing manifestations at a later time, if patients’ 
clinical status has changed such that the abnormal laboratory value may be directl y 
affected (e.g., t ransfusion) .  Each patient must be re -consented before re -screening 
occurs.

Etrolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd
87/Protocol GA28950, Version 8Re-screening is not required for the HIV preliminary and confirmatory tests, HCV 
antibody test, and hepatitis B assessment (i.e., HBsAg, HBcAb, and, if required, HBV 
DNA), provided that the following criteria are met:
Test results are available from the initial screening 
Eligibility criteria for the assessments are satisfied
Date of the initial screening assessment was 6 weeks prior to the re -screening 
Day 1 visit (day of randomization for second screening)
In the investigator’s judgment, the patient is notdeemed to have been at risk for HIV, 
hepatitis C, or hepatitis B infection (based on medical history, or geographical or 
social circumstance)
As described in Section 4.6.1.5 , if a negative TB screening test result has been 
documented within 3 months before screening or rescreen, no repeat test is required.
The screening endoscopy and colonic biopsies do not need to be repeated during 
re-screening provided that all of the following criteria are met:
All endoscopy -related inclusion criteria have been met
The initial endoscopy has been performed withi n 28 days prior to Day 1 following 
thesecond screening
Colon biopsies as specified by the protocol have been obtained
If the initial screening endoscopy does not meet the conditions outlined above, the 
endoscopy and protocol -specified colon biopsies should be repeated 4 16 days prior to 
Day 1.
Re-Screening in the Event of Screen Failure due to C. Difficile or CMV Infection
Patients who are classified as screen failures due to the presence of C. difficile or CMV 
infection may be re -screened 60 days after successful treatment.  For patients who 
screen failed due to CMV infection, l aboratory analysis of CMV from colon biopsy 
sample is required during re -screening evaluation to rule out CMV infection .
See Appendix 1for the schedule of screening and pretreatment assessments.
4.6.2.2 Assessments during Treatment
All assessments will be performed on the day of the specified visit, except where a time 
window is specified.  Assessments scheduled on the day of study drug administration 
should be performed prior to dosing, unless otherwise noted.  When study drug 
administration in the home is required on the same day as a clinic visit, drug is to be 
administered at home AFTER the clinic visit.
For induction ( Week 14) and maintenance (W eek 66) visits that are associated with a 
MCS requiring endoscopy, every effort should be made to schedule the endoscopy on 
Etrolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd
88/Protocol GA28950, Version 8the same day as the clinic visit.If this is not possible, endoscopy should be performed 
as close to the clinic visit as possible, with a maximal window of 3 days prior to and 
5days after the visit .The endoscopy score should be considered when determining the 
PGA (as applicable), a component of the MCS (see Appendix 3).
On a number of occasions during the Maintenance Phase (see Appendix 1and Figure 3), 
patients will be contacted by telephone for the purpose of study assessment, rather than 
making a clinic visit.  Data will be collected as for a clinic visit at this time with the 
exception of blood sample and in clinic PRO assessments.  All patients will be queried 
and closely moni tored for any adverse event at all study assessment timepoints 
(every 4weeks) during both clinic visits and study assessments made over the 
telephone.  All adverse events and concomitant medications will be recorded and the 
patient questioned regarding a potential clinical relapse.  An unscheduled visit is to be 
conducted as required ( see Section 4.6.2.5).
All patients will receive hands -on training in use of the e -diary and tablet .  Patients will 
also be instructed to contact the site promptly if they have any questions about the use 
of the e -diary during screening or at any time during the study.
See Appendix 1for the schedule of assessments performed during the trea tment period.
4.6.2.3 Assessments at Study Completion/Early  Withdrawal from 
Treatment Visit
The completion of the study treatment period is defined as the W eek 66 visit.  Patients 
who complete the treatment medication will be asked to visit the clinic for W eek66 
assessments. Eligible patients who consent to receive open -label etrolizumab Part 1 
(OLE) of Study GA28951 are to receive their first dose of open -label etrolizumab 4 
weeks after their last dose of study medication in this study. On occasions where this 
first dose of etrolizumab in Part 1 (OLE) of Study GA28951 cannot be administered in 
accordance with these requirements, the first dose of etrolizumab is to be administered 
with a maximum delay of 2 weeks from the scheduled dosing day in Part 1 (OLE) 
Study GA28951.
If a patient leaves the study prior to W eek 66, an early withdrawal from treatment visit is 
to be conducted on his or her next scheduled visit, including for those patients who are 
enrolling in Study GA28951 (OLE -SM).  Assessments are specified in the Schedule of 
Assessments in Appendix 1.  Following completion of assessments at this early 
withdrawal from treatment visit, eligible patients are to receive their first dose of 
open -label etrolizumab in Part 1 (OLE) Study GA28951 weeks af ter their last dose of 
study medication in this study, with a maximum delay of 2 weeks from the scheduled 
dosing day in Study GA28951.
Etrolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd
89/Protocol GA28950, Version 8At any timepoint, patients who arenot eligible or who choose not to enroll in Part 1(OLE) 
of Study GA28951 are to enrol l in Part 2 (SM) of Study GA28951 for extended PML 
follow -up after completion of the 12 -week safety follow -up in this study. 
Patients who were treated with prohibited medication a re to have their early withdrawal 
from treatment visit at their next scheduled visit followed by the 12- week safety follow -up 
phase of this study (telephone call at Week6 and clinic visit at Week 12; 
seeAppendix 2).  Patients are to then enroll in Part 2 (SM) of Study GA28951 for 
extended PML monitoring.
4.6.2.3.1 Eligibility  for Entry to Open -Label Extension and Safety  
Monitoring Study
The Study GA28951 (OLE -SM) will be conducted under a separate pro tocol and eligible 
patients as described below (also see Table 4 ) will need to be willing and able to provide 
separate informed consent to enter this study.
Note:  Patients who are not eligible or who do not wish to receive open -label etrolizumab 
Part 1 (OLE)of Study GA28951 will be requested to enroll in the 92-week extended PML 
monitoring Part 2 (SM)of Study GA28951 after completing the 12 -week safety follow -up 
in this study.
The follo wing patients may  be eligible to enroll in Part 1 (OLE) of Study  GA28951 :
In the Induction Phase, any patient who requires initiation of an imm unosuppressant 
(AZA, 6-MP, MTX), corticosteroid, or oral or topical 5-ASA, or increase in dose of 
these medications over baseline levels for treatment of worsening disease 
sympto ms may enroll in Part 1 (OLE)of Study GA28951 after the W eek 14 
assessment, if eligible.   
Patients who do not achieve a clinical response at Week 14
Patients who meet the criteria for relapse (see Section 4.5.1 for definition) at any 
time between W eek 14 and Week 66

92/Protocol GA28950, Version 84.6.2.4 Safety  Follow -Up A ssessments
Safety follow -up will be conducted in this study for a period of 12 weeks for patients not 
enrolling in Part 1 (OLE)of Study GA28951 (see Table 4 for patients who should enter 
the 12 -week safety follow -up phase within this protocol, Appendix 2).  Patients will be 
assessed at 6 -week intervals during this period, one assessment by phone and one 
in-person clinic visit. The visits should be scheduled based on the date of the last dose 
of study drug (e.g., the W eek 6 telephone visit should take place 6 weeks after the last 
dose of study drug). Patients enrolling into Part 1 (OLE)of Study GA28951 will not enter 
the 12 -week safety follow -up period in this study.   Adverse events should be followed as 
outlined in Section 5.4.
Following the 12 -week safety monitoring period, patients should enroll in Part 2 (SM)of 
Study GA28951 where they will be monitored for PML for an additional 92 weeks.  
Patients enrolling in Part 2 (SM)of Study GA28951 for the extended PML monitoring will 
NOT receive treatment with open -label etrolizumab.  During the extended PML follow -up 
period in Study GA28951 , patients will have telephone assessments every 6 months to 
assess emergence of symptoms and signs of PML.  In total, follow -up for the 
development of any signs or symptoms of PML will be conducted for a period of 2 years 
after last dose of study drug.
Patients who discontinue from the study prior to completion of the 12 -week safety 
follow -up will be asked to return to the clinic within 30 days ( 7 days) after the last dose 
of study drug or last scheduled visit for an early termination visit (Appendix 2).
See Appendix 1for the schedule of assessments performed at the study 
completion/early withdrawal from treatment visit.
After the study completion, adverse events should be followed as outlined in 
Sections 5.5and5.6.
SeeAppendix 2for the schedule of 12 -week safety follow -up assessments.
4.6.2.5 Assessments at Unscheduled Visits
An unscheduled visit may oc cur at any time during the study, (i.e., due to relapse of 
disease or an adverse event).  Patients who are seen by the investigator or site staff at a 
timepoint not required by the protocol because of assessment of potential relapse will 
undergo the follow ing:
Review of e -diary data
Recording of concomitant medications and procedures
Collection of adverse events and serious adverse events
Clinical chemistry and hematology, and CRP, if indicated
Stool sample collection, if indicated
Partial or complete MCS, if indicated
Etrolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd
93/Protocol GA28950, Version 8Flexible sigmoidoscopy, if indicated
Colonic biopsy to evaluate for CMV, if clinically indicated
Collection of PK and ATA sample, if indicated
See Appendix 1for assessments that are to be performed in case of an unscheduled 
visit. 
4.7 PATIENT, STUDY, AND SITE DISCONTINUA TION
4.7.1 Patient Discontinuation
The investigator has the right to discontinue a patient from study drug or withdr aw a 
patient from the study at any time.  In addition, patients have the right to voluntarily 
discontinue study drug or withdraw from the study at any time for any reason.  Reasons 
for discontinuation of study drug or withdrawal from the study may include but are not 
limited to the following:
Patient withdrawal of consent at any time
Any medical condition that the investigator or Sponsor determines may jeopardize 
the patient’s safety if he or she continues in the study
Investigator or Sponsor determines it is in the best interest of the patient
Patient non -compliance, specifically defined as missing scheduled visits or 
non-adherence with background medications
4.7.1.1 Discontinuation from Study  Drug
Patients must discontinue study drug if they experience any of the following:
Pregnancy
Anaphylaxis or other severe hypersensitivity reaction
Develop colonic mucosal dysplasia
Malignancy (with the exception of local and resect edbasal or squamous cell 
carcinoma of the skin) or cervical Pap test with AIS, HSIL, or CIN of Grade 1
Specific serious infection (see Table 5for details on serious infection):
Any patient who experiences a specific de novo or re activated serious viral 
infection, such as HBV, HCV, HIV, should discontinue study medication.
Any patient who develops CMV colitis as defined by colon biopsy samples should 
discontinue study medication, but may be considered to restart study treatment 
only after consultation with the Medical Monitor once the event has resolved and 
treatment with appropriate anti -viral medication has been completed.
Any patient who de velops life- threatening infecti onsduring the st udy should 
discontinue study medication.
Any medication for rescue outside defined limits of the protocol (see Section 4.4.2 )
Etrolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd
94/Protocol GA28950, Version 8Patients who discontinue study drug prematurely for the reasons listed above will be 
asked to return to the clinic for a study completion/early withdrawal from treatment visit 
(see Section 4.6.2.3) and will continue to undergo safety follow -up assessments for 
12weeks within this study.  Patients should then enroll in Part2 (SM) of Study GA28951
for 92 weeks of monitoring for PML (see Section 4.6.2.4 ).  The primary reason for 
premature study drug disc ontinuation should be documented on the appropriate eCRF.  
Patients who discontinue study drug prematurely will not be replaced.
4.7.1.2 Withdrawal from Study
Every effort should be made to obtain information on patients who withdraw from the 
study.  The primary reason for withdrawal from the study should be documented on the 
appropriate eCRF.  Patients will not be followed for any reason after consent has been 
withdrawn.  Patients who withdraw from the study will not be replaced.
4.7.2 Study and Site Discon tinuation
The Sponsor has the right to terminate this study at any time.  Reasons for te rminating 
the study may include ,but are not limited to ,the following:
The incidence or severity of adverse events in this or other studies indicates a 
potential health hazard to patients.
Patient enrollment is unsatisfactory.
The Sponsor will notify the investigator if the study is placed on hold or if the Sponsor 
decides to discontinue the study or development program.
The Sponsor has the right to replace a site at any time.  Reasons fo r replacing a site 
may include ,but are not limited to ,the following:
Excessively slow recruitment

Good Clinical Practice
5. ASSESSMENT OF SA FETY
5.1 SAFETY PLA N
The safety plan for this study is designed to ensure patient safety and mitigate potential 
risks.  The principles of the safety plan include education of investigators and patients 
regarding all identified and potential safety risks, specific eligibility criteria to screen out 
at-risk patients, monitoring to ensure timely identification and management of a safety 
event, and management strategy such as guidelines for treating an event and for 
withholding or discontinuing study treatment, as appropriate.  These principles are to be 
applied for all safety risks in the clinical program. 
Etrolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd
95/Protocol GA28950, Version 85.1.1 Potential Risks for Etrolizumab
Etrolizumab is an investigational drug that demonstrated a safety prof ile similar to 
placebo in the Phase II study, EUCALYPTUS.  Given the relatively limited size of 
Phase II studies, the full safety profile is not known at this time and will be further 
characterized during the etrolizumab Phase III program.  
The potential and/or hypothetical risks for etrolizumab are based on its mechanism of 
action, available nonclinical and clinical data, data from other anti -integrin drugs, and 
general risks associated with biologic agents.  
Investigators should always refer to the Etro lizumab Investigator's Brochure (Section 6) 
for a complete summary of safety information.
5.1.2 Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy
PML is a potentially fatal neurological condition linked to reactivation of a polyomavirus 
(JCV) and active viral replicati on in the brain.  
Cases of PML have been reported in patients with CD and multiple sclerosis who 
received concomitant treatment with the anti -4 integrin natalizumab and 
immunosuppressives.
Integrin 41, which is inhibited by natalizumab, is a pleiotropic integrin which is 
believed to facilitate T cell migration into the CNS.  Inhibition of integrin 41 is thought 
to reduce (CNS) immune surveillance and facilitate development of PML.
PML has not been attributed to vedolizumab, which selectively impedes lymphocyte 
trafficking into gut tissue by specifically blocking only the 47integrin and not the 41 
integrin despite extensive treatment exposure (Dotan 2017 ).
Etrolizumab targets cells expressing the 7 integrin ( 47 and E7 cells) and not 
41cells.  Despite the lack of theoretical or experimental evidence for a specific role of 
7integrins in leukocyte homing to the CNS, given the observation of PML risk with 
natalizumab, the Sponsor will continue to conduct extensive risk -monitoring procedures 
during the Phase III trials.
5.1.2.1 Screening and Patient Selection
No known interventions can reliably prevent PML or adequately treat PML, if it occurs; 
therefore, it is important to exclude patients with a perceived higher baseline risk for 
PML.  At study screening, patients with a history of demyelinating disease, PML, or 
clinically significant abnormalities noted on baseline neurologic examination will be 
excluded from the study.  Patients who have received natalizumab, efalizumab, or 
rituximab w ill also be excluded.
Etrolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd
96/Protocol GA28950, Version 8A blood sample to test for antibodies to JCV will be taken and stored for possible later 
assessment of how widespread the JCV infection is in the study population.  Sample 
testing for the presence of JCV antibodies is not helpful in p redicting risk for PML or for 
evaluating neurologic symptoms.  The sample may be tested if there is a strong belief 
that this information will be helpful in managing a patient's condition.
5.1.2.2 Monitoring and Management
Study site personnel and patient particip ants will be educated regarding the signs and 
symptoms of PML and provided with alert cards .  Close monitoring during the course of 
the study for any new signs or symptoms suggestive of PML will be performed with 
regular neurologic examinations (including evaluation of cranial nerves, motor and 
sensory function, coordination, and mental status) as per the Schedule of Assessments 
(see Appendix 1).  The PML Subjective Checklist (symptom assessment) and the PML 
Objective Checklist (neurologic evaluation) will be administered (see Appendix 5)by a 
qualified HCP and will be performed at screening and as indicated on the Schedule of 
Assessments (see Appendix 1).
During the in- clinic visits, patients will under go PML monitoring assessments .
If a patient has a positive finding on the PML Subjective Checklist that is accompanied 
by a positive finding on the PML Objective Checklist, or if there is strong clinical 
suspicion for PML, the event should be expeditiously reported as an adverse event of 
special int erest within 24 hours (see Section 5.2and Appendix 6for the Algorithm for 
Evaluation of Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy).  If PML is suspected, 
dosing with study treatment for that patient will be suspended and the patient should be 
promptly referred to a ne urologist.  Following formal evaluation by a neurologis t,if PML 
cannot be ruled out , the case will be referred to an expert PML adjudication committee 
for further work -up,which may include brain MRI with and without contrast.  If there 
remains any suspicion for PML, the PML adjudication committee may recommend 
performing a lumbar puncture with CSF analysis for JCV DNA by PCR.  If JCV DNA is 
detected, the patient should be treated as a PML case and the patient should 
permanently discontinue study drug and enter safety follow -up.  Dosing with study 
treatments can only be resumed in patients where PML has been ruled out.  Refer to 
Appendix 6for the Algorithm for Evaluation of Progressive Multifocal 
Leukoencephalopa thy (PML).
There is no known effective treatment for PML.  Plasmapheresis has been employed in 
some pati ents where the event has been thought to be due to administration of a drug 
(Tan et al. 2011 ).
Etrolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd
97/Protocol GA28950, Version 85.1.3 Monitoring for Other Serious Infections
Patients will also be monitored closely for other serious infections during the study 
(see Table 5 for details).  Patients and investigators will be informed of the possibility 
ofincreased susceptibility to infectious pathogens .  Investigators will be encouraged to 
promptly evaluate and aggressively treat any signs and symptoms consistent with an 
infection.
5.1.4 Monitoring for Hypersensitivity Reactions
In addition, throughout the study, patients will be monitored closely for hyperse nsitivity 
reactions (see Table 5 for details).  Patients should be instructed to recognize the 
symptoms of any anaphylactic, anaphylactoid, or hypersensitivity reaction, and to 
contact an HCP or seek immediate care in case of any such symptoms.  Patients will be 
provided with alert cards to remind them and a caregiver or partner of the symptoms.

98/Protocol GA28950, Version 85.1.5 Management of Specific A dverse Events
Table 5Guidelines for Managing Specific A dverse Events
Event Action to Be Taken
Serious Infections Patients who experience a serious infection event (i.e., an infection that is a serious adverse event) should not 
receive further study drug until the event has completely resolved and treatment with anti -infective m edications 
has been completed.
All efforts should be made to identify the infectious agent.
For those patients who recover from a serious infection, study medication may be restarted following consultation 
with the Medical Monitor.
Any patient who experien ces a specific de novo or reactivated serious viral infection such as HBV, HCV, HIV, 
should immediately discontinue study drug.
Any patient who develops CMV colitis should not receive further study drug until the event has resolved and 
treatment with appropriate anti -viral medication has been completed.  Re -initiation of therapy requires consultation 
with the Medical Monitor
Patients who develop life -threatening infections during the study should discontinue study drug.
Signs and symptoms of possible 
PMLIf a patient has a positive finding on the PML Subjective Checklist that is accompanied by a positive finding on the PML 
Objective Checklist, or if there is strong clinical suspicion for PML, then the investigator is required to follow the process 
desc ribed in the PML algorithm (see Appendix 6).  If PML is suspected, a neurology consultation should be promptly 
arranged.  Based on this evaluation, brain magnetic resonance imaging and cerebral- spinal fluid JCV analysis may be 
performed (see Appendix 6).
The following are signs and symptoms that may potentially indicate PML:
Alteration in mental status (cognitive changes, including confusion, difficulty concentrating, memory loss) and 
altered behavior (including personality changes)
Higher cortical dysfunction, including impaired comprehension and/or formulation of language (aphasia), loss of 
ability to recognize objects, persons, sounds, shapes, or smells (agnosia)
Visual changes, including loss of visual fields (homonymous hemianopsia), double vision (diplopia)
Motor defi cits, including weakness (hemiparesis, monoparesis), seizures, (generalized or partial), difficulties with 
speech (dysarthria,) or swallowing (dysphagia)

Signs and symptoms of possible 
PML (cont.)Sensory deficits, incl uding sensory loss (paresthesia )
Coordination deficits, including difficulty walking and maintaining balance (ataxia), lack of voluntary coordination of 
limb movement (limb ataxia)
If PML is suspected then all investigational treatment should be withheld in that patient and may only be r estarted if it is 
confirmed that the patient does not have PML.
Vaccinations For 4 weeks prior, during, and for 12 weeks after the last dose of study medication, patients should not receive live 
vaccines.
Malignancies Any signs or symptoms that could be suggestive of malignancy should be promptly and aggressively evaluated 
and reported to the Sponsor.  Incident hematologic abnormalities (e.g., new or worsening neutropenia, anemia, 
thrombocytopenia, macrocytosis, or atypical cells in the W BC differential) should be carefully evaluated.
If any dysplasias or abnormalities are noted that could be consistent with malignancy, an oncologist or appropriate 
specialist should be consulted and no further doses of investigational product should be administered until a
thorough clinical evaluation has been completed.
Patients who develop a malignancy (with the exception of local and resect edbasal or squamous cell carcinoma of 
the skin), or who develop adenocarcinoma in situ, high -grade squamous intraepithelial lesions, or cervical 
intraepithelial neoplasia of Grade 1 on cervical Pap smear, or who develop colonic dysplasia during the study 
should be withdrawn from study drug and must not receive additional doses of study drug.
Hepatic effects Liver toxicity has been r eported with other class drugs that target 4 integrins (natalizumab) and 47 integrins 
(vedolizumab).  Therefore, this potential risk is being monitored in the etrolizumab studies.  In nonclinical chronic 
toxicology studies, no abnormalities indicating l iver toxicity with etrolizumab were observed; the risk in humans is 
currently unknown.
Patients with significant liver function test abnormalities should be excluded from the etrolizumab clinical studies.
Patients should receive guidance on reporting liver problems if they occur.
Liver function tests should continue to be monitored according to the schedule of assessments and as clinically 
indicated.
Significant hepatic events should be evaluated promptly and managed accordingly.

Hypersensitivity reactions In completed Phase I/II clinical trials of etrolizumab, one serious adverse event of hypersensitivity (Grade 2) has been 
reported, no anaphylactic, anaphylactoid, or severe hypersensitivity reactions were observed; however, anaphylaxis 
and hypersensitivit y reactions will be closely monitored during the study.
Patients with a history of moderate or severe allergic or anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions to chimeric, human, 
or humanized antibodies, fusion proteins, or murine proteins are excluded from study participation.
The first four injections will be administered in the clinic.  After the first four injections, the patient must be 
monitored for 60 minutes after each injection.
Health care professionals administering the study medication in the clinic mus t be trained in the appropriate 
administration procedures and be able to recognize the symptoms associated with potential anaphylactic, 
anaphylactoid, or hypersensitivity reactions and should be familiar with Sampson’s criteria for defining anaphylaxis 
(Sampson et al. 2006; see Appendix 8).
Investigators and HCPs should also be trained to accurately and appropriately report these events imm ediately to 
the Sponsor as adverse events of special interest and as serious adverse events, if appropriate (see Section 5.2).
Medicin al products for the treatment of hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., epinephrine, antihistamines, and 
glucocorticoids ). Epinephrine must be readily available for immediate use if required to treat anaphylaxis. 
Adjunctive medications such as parenteral diphenhydramine and inhaled bronchodilators may be used IN 
ADDITION to epinephrine if necessary .  Resuscitation equipment should also be available. Site personnel must 
be able to detect and treat such reactions.
If a patient has symptoms of anaphylaxis or seve re hypersensitivity, the administration of etrolizumab must be 
discontinued permanently.
HCPs should also instruct patients how to recognize the symptoms of any anaphylactic, anaphylactoid, or 
hypersensitivity reaction and to contact a HCP or seek emergenc y care in case of any such symptoms.
Subsequent injections can be administered at home.  The patient will be advised to seek emergency care in 
response to any potential symptom of hypersensitivity and will receive two alert cards to remind them and a 
careg iver or partner of the symptoms.
Detailed information regarding anaphylactic, anaphylactoid, or hypersensitivity reactions that occur during the study will 
be collected, regardless of whether the events are serious (see Section 5.2.2 ) or non -serious (see Section 5.2.3 ).

102/Protocol GA28950, Version 85.2 SAFETY PA RAMETERS A ND DEFINIT IONS
Safety assessments will consist of monitoring and recording adverse events, including 
serious adverse events and adverse events of special interest; measurement of 
protocol -specified safety laboratory assessments; measurement of pr otocol -specified 
vital signs; and other protocol -specified tests that are deemed critical to the safety 
evaluation of the study.
Certain types of events require immediate reporting to the Sponsor, as outlined in 
Section 5.4.
5.2.1 Adverse Events
According to the ICH guideline for Good Clinical Practice, an adverse event is any 
untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation patient administered a 
pharmaceutical product, regardless of causal attribution.  An adverse event can 
therefore be any of the following:
Any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, 
whether or not considered related to the medicinal product
Any new disease or exacerbation of an existing disease (a worsening in the 
character, frequency, or severity of a known condition) (see Section s 5.3.5.8 and 
5.3.5.9 )
Recurrence of an intermittent medi cal condition (e.g., headache) not present at 
baseline
Any deterioration in a laboratory value or other clinical test (e.g., ECG, X -ray) that is 
associated with symptoms or leads to a change in study treatment, concomitant 
treatment, or discontinuation fro m study drug
Adverse events that are related to a protocol -mandated intervention, including those 
that occur prior to assignment of study treatment (e.g., screening invasive 
procedures such as biopsy sample collections)
5.2.2 Serious A dverse Events (Immediately Reportable to the 
Sponsor)
All serious adverse events are required to be reported by the investigator to the Sponsor 
immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event; see Section 5.4.2for 
reporting instructions ).A serious adverse event is any adverse event that meets any of 
the following criteria:
Fatal (i.e., the adverse event actually causes or leads to death)
Life threatening (i.e., the adverse event, in the view of the investigator, places the 
patient at immediate risk of death)
This does not include any adverse event that had it occurred in a more severe 
form or was allowed to continue might have caused death .
Requires or prolongs inpatient hospitalization (see Section 5.3.5.10)
Etrolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd
103/Protocol GA28950, Version 8Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (i. e., the adverse event 
results in substantial disruption of the patient’s ability to conduct normal life 
functions)
Congenital anomaly/birth defect in a neonate/infant born to a mother exposed to 
study drug
Significant medical event in the investigator's judgment (e.g., may jeopardize the 
patient or may require medical/surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes 
listed above)
The terms “severe” and “serious” are notsynonymous.  Severity refers to the intensity of 
an adverse event (e.g., rated as m ild, moderate, or severe, or according to National 
Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [NCI CTCAE] criteria; 
see Section 5.3.3 ); the event itself may be of relatively minor medical significance (such 
as severe headache without any further findings).
Severity and seriousness need to be independently assessed for each adverse event 
recorded on the eCRF.
5.2.3 Adverse Events of Special Interest (Immediately  Reportable to 
the Sponsor)
Adverse events of special interest are required to be reported by the investigator to the 
Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event; see 
Section 5.4.2 for reporting instructions).  Adverse events of special interest for this study 
include the following:
Cases of potential drug- induced liver injury that include an elevated ALT or AST in 
combination with either an elevated bilirubin or clinical jaundice, as defined by Hy’s 
Law (see Section 5.3.5.6 )
Suspected transmission of an infectious agent by the study drug as defined below :
Any organism, virus, or infectious particle (e.g., prion protein transmitting 
transmissible spongiform encephalopathy), pathogenic or non -patho genic, is 
considered an infectious agent.  A transmission of an infectious agent may be 
suspected from clinical symptoms or laboratory findings that indicate an 
infection in a patient exposed to a medicinal product.  This term applies only
when a contamination of the study drug is suspected.
Adverse events of special i nterest specific to etrolizumab
Systemic hypersensitivity reactions and anaphylactic and anaphylactoid 
reactions (see Section 5.1.5 and Sampson’s Criteria in Appendix 8)
Neurologic al signs, symptoms, and AE that may suggest possible PML , on the 
basis of a positive finding on the PML Subjective Checklist that is accompanied 
by a positive finding on the PML Objective Checklist, or if there is strong clinical 
suspicion for PML (see Appendix 6and Table 5 )
Etrolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd
104/Protocol GA28950, Version 85.3 METHODS A ND TIMING F OR CA PTURING A ND ASSESSING 
SAFETY PARAMETERS
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all adverse events (see Section 5.2.1 for 
definition) are recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF and reported to the Sponsor in 
accordance with instructions provided in this section and in Sections 5.4,5.5,and5.6.  
The investigator is also responsible for reporting medical device complaints 
(see Section 5.4.4 ).
For each adverse event recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, the investigator will make 
an asse ssment of seriousness (see Section 5.2.2 for seriousness criteria), severity 
(see Section 5.3.3 ), and causality (see Section 5.3.4 ).
5.3.1 Adverse Eve nt Reporting Period
Investigators will seek information on adverse events at each patient contact.  All 
adverse events, whether reported by the patient or noted by study personnel, will be 
recorded in the patient’s medical record and on the Adverse Event e CRF.
After informed consent has been obtained but prior to initiation of study drug , only 
serious adverse events caused by a protocol -mandated intervention (e.g., invasive 
procedures such as biopsy sample collections, discontinuation of medications) should be 
reported (see Section 5.4.2 for instructions for reporting serious adverse events).
After initiation of study drug, all adverse e vents, regardless of relationship to study drug, 
will be reported until the patient completes his or her last study visit.  After this period, for 
patients who enter the OLE- SM study ( Study GA28951 ), adverse event reporting should 
follow requirements of the OLE-SM study ( Study GA28951 ).
If the patient does not enter the OLE-SM study ( Study GA28951 ),the Sponsor should be 
notified if the investigator becomes aware of any poststudy serious adverse events that 
are believed to be related to prior study drug tr eatment. In addition, the Sponsor should 
be notified if the investigator becomes aware of any post -study events of confirmed or 
suspected PML, regardless of relationship to study drug, for up to 2 years after the 
patient’s last dose of study drug (see Section5.6).
5.3.2 Eliciting A dverse Ev ent Information
A consistent methodology of non -directive questioning should be adopted for eliciting 
adverse event information at all patient evaluation timepoints.  Ex amples of non -directive 
questions include the following:
“How have you felt since your last clinic visit?”
“Have you had any new or changed health problems since you were last here?”
Etrolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd
105/Protocol GA28950, Version 85.3.3 Assessment of Severity  of A dverse Events
The adverse event severity grading scale for the NCI CTCAE (v4.0) will be used for 
assessing adverse event severity.  Table 6 will be used for assessing severity for 
adverse events that are not specifically listed in the NCI CTCAE.
Table 6Adverse Event Severity Grading Scale for Events Not Specifically 
Listed in NCI CTCA E
Grade Severity
1 Mild; as ymptomatic or mild sy mptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; 
or intervention not indicated
2 Moderate; minimal, local, or non -invasive intervention indicated; or limiting 
age-appropriate instrumental activities of daily livinga
3 Severe or medically significant, but not immediately life-threatening; 
hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; or 
limiting self-care activities of daily livingb,c
4 Life-threatening consequences or urgent intervention indicatedd
5 Death related to adverse eventd
NCI CTCAE =National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events .
Note:  Based on the most recent version of NCI CTCAE (v4 .0), which can be found at:  
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm
aInstrumental activities of daily living refer to preparing meals, shopping for groceries or 
clothes, using the telephone, managing money, etc.
bExamples of self -care activities of daily living include bathing, dressing and undressing, 
feeding one's self, using the to ilet, and taking medications, as performed by patients who are 
not bedridden.
cIf an event is assessed as a "significant medical event," it must be reported as a serious 
adverse event (see Section 5.4.2for reporting instructions), per the definition of serious 
adverse event in Section 5.2.2 .
dGrade 4 and 5 events must be reported as serious adverse events (see Section 5.4.2 for 
reporting instructions) , per the definition of serious adverse event in Section 5.2.2 .
5.3.4 Assessment of Causality  of Adverse Events
Investigators should use t heir knowledge of the patient, the circumstances surrounding 
the event, and an evaluation of any potential alternative causes to determine whether an 
adverse event is considered to be related to the study drug, indicating "yes" or "no" 
accordingly.  The fo llowing guidance should be taken into consideration (see Table 7 ):
Temporal relationship of event onset to the initiation of study drug
Course of the event, considering especially the effects of dose reduction, 
discontinuation of study drug, or reintroduction of study drug (where applicable)
Known association of the event with the study drug or with similar treatments
Known association of the event with the disease under study
Etrolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd
106/Protocol GA28950, Version 8Presence of risk factors in the patient or use of concomitant medications known to 
increase the occurrence of the event
Presence of non -treatment -related factors that are known to be associated with the 
occurrence of the event
Table 7Causal A ttribution Guidance
Is the adverse event suspected to be caused by the study drug on the basis of facts, evidence, 
science -based rationales, and clinical judgment?
YES There is a plausible temporal relationship between the onset of the adverse event and 
administration of the study drug, and the adverse event cannot be readily explained by 
the patient’s clinical state, intercurrent illness, or concomitant therapies; and/or the 
adverse event follows a known pattern of response to the study drug; and/or the 
adverse event abates or resolves upon discontinuation of the study drug or dose 
reduction and, if applicable, reappears upon re -challenge.
NO An adverse event will be considered related, unless itfulfillsthe criteria as specified 
below. 
Evidence exists that the adverse event has an etiology other than the study drug 
(e.g., preexisting medical condition, underlying disease, intercurrent illness, 
orconcomitant medication); and/or the adverse event h as no plausible temporal 
relationship to administration of the study drug (e.g., cancer diagnosed 2 days after 
firstdose of study drug).
5.3.5 Procedures for Recording A dverse Events
Investigators should use correct medical terminology/concepts when recording adverse 
events on the Adverse Event eCRF.  Avoid colloquialisms and abbreviations.
Only one adverse event term should be recorded in the event field on the Adverse Event 
eCRF.
5.3.5.1 Diagnosis versus Signs and Sy mptoms
Injection- Site Reactions
Local cutaneous adverse events that occur at or around the injection site during or within 
24hours following study drug injection should be separately captured as individual signs 
(e.g., erythema, induration/swelling at injection site) or symptoms (e.g., pain, pruritus at 
injection site) rather than a diagnosis of allergic reaction or injection -site reaction.
Other A dverse Events 
For adverse events other than injection -site reactions, adiagnosis (if known) should be 
recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF rather than indiv idual signs and symptoms 
(e.g., record only liver failure or hepatitis rather than jaundice, asterixis, and elevated 
transaminases).  However, if a constellation of signs and/or symptoms cannot be 
medically characterized as a single diagnosis or syndrome at th e time of reporting, each 
individual event should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF.  If a diagnosis is 
subsequently established, all previously reported adverse events based on signs and 
Etrolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd
107/Protocol GA28950, Version 8symptoms should be nullified and replaced by one adverse event r eport based on the 
single diagnosis, with a starting date that corresponds to the starting date of the first 
symptom of the eventual diagnosis.
5.3.5.2 Adverse Events Occurring Secondary  to Other Events
In general, adverse events occurring secondary to other event s (e.g., cascade events or 
clinical sequelae) should be identified by their primary cause, with the exception of 
severe or serious secondary events.  Medically significant adverse events occurring 
secondary to an initiating event that are separated in time should be recorded as 
independent events on the Adverse Event eCRF.  For example:
If vomiting results in mild dehydration with no additional treatment in a healthy adult, 
only vomiting should be reported on the eCRF.
If vomiting results in severe dehydrat ion, both events should be reported separately 
on the eCRF.
If a severe gastrointestinal hemorrhage leads to renal failure, both events should be 
reported separately on the eCRF.
If dizziness leads to a fall and subsequent fracture, all three events should be 
reported separately on the eCRF.
If neutropenia is accompanied by an infection, both events should be reported 
separately on the eCRF.
All adverse events should be recorded separately on the Adverse Event eCRF if it is 
unclear as to whether the events are associated.
5.3.5.3 Persistent or Recurrent A dverse Events
A persistent adverse event is one that extends continuously, without resolution, between 
patient evaluation timepoints.  Such events should be recorded only once on the 
Adverse Event eCRF.  The initia l severity (intensity or grade) of the event will be 
recorded atthe time the event is first reported. If a persistent adverse event becomes 
more severe, the most extreme severity should also be recorded on the Adverse Event 
eCRF.   If the event becomes se rious, it should be reported to the Sponsor immediately 
(i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning that the event became serious; see 
Section 5.4.2 for reporting instructions). The Adverse Event eCRF should be updated by 
changing the event from “non -serious” to “serious,” providing the date that the event 
became serious, and completing all data fields related to serious adverse events .
A recurrent adverse event is one that resolves between patient evaluation timep oints 
and subsequently recurs. Each recurrence of an adverse event should be recorded 
separately on the Adverse Event eCRF.
Etrolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd
108/Protocol GA28950, Version 85.3.5.4 Abnormal Laboratory Values
Not every laboratory abnormality qualifies as an adverse event.  A laboratory test result 
must be reported as an adverse event if it meets any of the following criteria:
Accompanied by clinical symptoms
Results in a change in study treatment (e.g., dosage modification, treatme nt 
interruption, or treatment discontinuation)
Results in a medical intervention (e.g., potassium supplementation for hypokalemia) 
or a change in concomitant therapy
Clinically significant in the investigator’s judgment
It is the investigator’s responsibil ity to review all laboratory findings.  Medical and 
scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether an isolated laboratory 
abnormality should be classified as an adverse event.
If a clinically significant laboratory abnormality is a sign of a d isease or syndrome 
(e.g., alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin 5 ULN associated with cholecystitis), only the 
diagnosis (i.e., cholecystitis) should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF.
If a clinically significant laboratory abnormality is not a sign of a disease or syndrome, 
the abnormality itself should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, along with a 
descriptor indicating if the test result is above or below the normal range (e.g., "elevated 
potassium," as opposed to "abnormal potassium").  If the l aboratory abnormality can be 
characterized by a precise clinical term per standard definitions, the clinical term should 
be recorded as the adverse event.  For example, an elevated serum potassium level of 
7.0 mEq/L should be recorded as “hyperkalemia.”
Observations of the same clinically significant laboratory abnormality from visit to visit 
should only be recorded once on the Adverse Event eCRF (see Section 5.3.5.3 for 
details on recording persistent adverse events) .
5.3.5.5 Abnormal Vital Sign Values
Not every vital sign abnormality qualifies as an adverse event.  A vital sign result must 
be reported as an adverse event if it meets any of the following criteria:
Accompanied by clinical symptoms
Results in a change in study treatment (e.g., dosage modification, treatment 
interruption, or treatment discontinuation)
Results in a medical intervention or a change in concomitant therapy
Clinically si gnificant in the investigator’s judgment 
It is the investigator’s responsibility to review all vital sign findings.  Medical and scientific 
judgment should be exercised in deciding whether an isolated vital sign abnormality 
should be classified as an adv erse event.
Etrolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd
109/Protocol GA28950, Version 8If a clinically significant vital sign abnormality is a sign of a disease or syndrome 
(e.g., high blood pressure), only the diagnosis (i.e., hypertension) should be recorded on 
the Adverse Event eCRF.
Observations of the same clinically significant vital sign abnormality from visit to visit 
should only be recorded once on the Adverse Event eCRF (see Section 5.3.5.3 for 
details on recording persistent adverse events .
5.3.5.6 Abnormal Liver Function Tests
The finding of an elevated ALT or AST ( 3ULN) in combination with either an elevated 
total bilirubin ( 2ULN) or clinical jaundice in the absence of cholestasis or other 
causes of hyperbilirubinemia is considered to be an indicator of severe liver injury (as 
defined by Hy's Law) .  Therefore, investigators must report as an adverse event the 
occurrence of either of the following:
Treatmen t-emergent ALT or AST 3ULN in combination with total bilirubin 
2ULN 
Treatment -emergent ALT or AST 3ULN in combination with clinical jaundice
The most appropriate diagnosis or (if a diagnosis cannot be established) the abnormal 
laboratory v alues should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF (see Section 5.3.5.1) 
and reported to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of 
the event), either as a serious adverse event or a nadverse event of special interest 
(see Section 5.4.2 ).
5.3.5.7 Deaths
All deaths that occur during the protocol -specified adverse event reporting period 
(see Section 5.3.1 ), regardless of relationship to study drug, must be recorded on the 
Adverse Event eCRF and immediately reported to the Sponsor (see Section 5.4.2 ).  This 
includes death attributed to progression of UC.
Death should be considered an outcome and not a distinct event.  The event or conditi on 
that caused or contributed to the fatal outcome should be recorded as the single medical 
concept on the Adverse Event eCRF.  Generally, only one such event should be 
reported.  If the cause of death is unknown and cannot be ascertained at the time of 
reporting, “unexplained death” should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF.  If the 
cause of death later becomes available (e.g., after autopsy), “unexplained death” should 
be replaced by the established cause of death. The term " sudden death " should not be
used unless combined with the presumed cause of death (e.g., "sudden cardiac death").
If the death is attributed to progression of UC, "ulcerative colitis progression” should be 
recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF.
Deaths that occur after the adverse event reporting period should be reported as 
described in Section 5.6.
Etrolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd
110/Protocol GA28950, Version 85.3.5.8 Preexisting Medical Conditions
A preexisting medical condition is one that is present at the screening visit for this study.  
Such conditions should be recorded on the General Medical History and Baseline 
Conditions eCRF.
A preexisting medical condition should be recorded as an adverse event only if the 
frequency, severi ty, or character of the condition worsens during the study.  W hen 
recording such events on the Adverse Event eCRF, it is important to convey the concept 
that the preexisting condition has changed by including applicable descriptors 
(e.g., “more frequent he adaches”).
5.3.5.9 Lack of Efficacy  or Worsening of Ulcerative Colitis
Medical occurrences or symptoms of deterioration that are anticipated as part of UC 
should be recorded as an adverse event if judged by the investigator to have 
unexpectedly worsened in severity or frequency or changed in nature at any time during 
the study.  W hen recording an unanticipated worsening UC on the Adverse Event eCRF, 
it is important to convey the concept that the condition has changed by including 
applicable descriptors (e.g., “acce lerated ulcerative colitis” or “worsening of ulcerative 
colitis”).
5.3.5.10 Hospitalization or Prolonged Hospitalization
Any adverse event that results in hospitalization (i.e., in- patient admission to a hospital) 
or prolonged hospitalization should be documented a nd reported as a serious adverse 
event (per the definition of serious adverse event in Section 5.2.2 ), except as outlined 
below.  The duration of hospitalization should also be noted on the eCRF.
An event that leads to hospitalization under the following circumstances should not be 
reported as an adverse event or a serious adverse event:
Hospitalization for respite care
Planned hospitali zation required by the protocol (e.g., for study drug administration 
or insertion of access device for study drug administration)
Hospitalization for a preexisting condition, provided that all of the following criteria 
are met:
The hospitalization was planned prior to the study or was scheduled during the 
study when elective surgery became necessary because of the expected 
normal progression of the disease.
The patient has not suffered an adverse event.
An event that leads to hospitalization under the following circumstances is not 
considered to be a serious adverse event , but should be reported as an adverse event 
instead:
Hospitalization that was necessary because of patient requirement for outpatient 
care outside of normal outpatient clinic operating hours
Etrolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd
111/Protocol GA28950, Version 85.3.5.11 Adverse Events A ssociated with an Overdose or Error in Drug 
Administration
Study drug overdose is the accidental or intentional use of the drug in an amount higher 
than the dose being studied.  An overdose or incorrect administration of study drug i s not 
an adverse event unless it results in untoward medical effects.
Any study drug overdose or errors in administration of study drug (e.g., dosing outside of 
the allowed window and injection without completion of full volume administration) 
should be no ted on the Study Drug Administration eCRF.
All adverse events associated with an overdose or errors in administration of study drug 
(e.g., dosing outside of the allowed window and injection without completion of full 
volume administration) should be record ed on the Adverse Event eCRF.  If the 
associated adverse event fulfills serious criteria, the event should be reported to the 
Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event; see 
Section 5.4.2 ).
5.3.5.12 Patient -Reported Outcome Data
Adverse event reports will not be derived from PRO data by the Sponsor, and safety 
analyses will not be performed using PRO data.  Sites are not expected to review the 
PRO data for adverse events. 
5.4 IMMEDIA TE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FROM 
INVESTIGA TOR TO SPON SOR
Certain events require immediate reporting to allow the Sponsor to take appropriate 
measures to address potential new risks in a clinical trial.  The investigator must report 
such events to the Sponsor immediately; under no circumstances should reporting take 
place more than 24 hours after the investigator learns of the event.  The following is a list 
of events that the investigator must report to the Sponsor within 24 hours after learning 
of the event, regardless of relationship to study drug:
Serious adverse events (seeSection 5.4.2 for further details)
Adverse events of special interest (see Section 5.4.2 for further details)
Pregnancies (see Section 5.4.3 for further details)
The investigator must report new significant follow -up information for these events to the 
Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after becoming aware of the 
information).  New significant information includes the following:
New signs or symptoms or a change in t he diagnosis
Significant new diagnostic test results
Change in causality based on new information
Etrolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd
112/Protocol GA28950, Version 8Change in the event’s outcome, including recovery
Additional narrative information on the clinical course of the event
Investigators must also comply with local requirements for reporting serious adverse 
events to the local health authority and IRB/EC.

Medical Monitor: , M.B., Ch.B.
Primary: 1 973 659 6677
Secondary: 1 570 819 8565
To ensure the safety of study patients, an Emergency Medical Call Center Help Desk will 
access the Quintiles Medical Emergency List, escalate emergency medical calls, provide 
medical translation service (if necessary), connect the investi gator with a Quintiles 
Medical Monitor, and track all calls.  The Emergency Medical Call Center Help Desk will 
be available 24 hours per day, 7 days per week. A primary global contact number and 
additional back up number for the Help Desk and Medical Moni tor contact information 
will be distributed to all investigators.
5.4.2 Reporting Requirements for Serious A dverse Ev ents and 
Adverse Events of Special Interest
After informed consent has been obtained but prior to initiation of study drug, only 
serious adverse events caused by a protocol -mandated intervention should be reported.  
The paper Clinical Trial Serious Adverse Event/Adverse Event of Special Interest 
Reporting Form provided to investigators should be completed and submitted to the 
Sponsor or its designe e immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the 
event), either by faxing or by scanning and emailing the form using the fax number or 
email address provided to investigators.
After initiation of study drug, serious adverse events and adver se events of special 
interest will be reported until the patient completes his or her last study visit .  
Investigators should record all case details that can be gathered immediately (i.e., within 
24 hours after learning of the event ) on the Adverse Event eCRF and submit the report 
via the EDC system.  A report will be generated and sent to Roche Safety Risk 
Management by the EDC system.
In the event that the EDC system is unavailable, the paper Clinical Trial Serious Adverse 
Event /Adverse Event of Special Interest Reporting Form should be completed and 
submitted to the Sponsor or its designee immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after 
learning of the event), either by faxing or by scanning and e mailing the form with use of 
the fax numbers or email address provided to investigators.  Once the EDC system is 
available, all information will need to be entered and submitted via the EDC system.

Etrolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd
113/Protocol GA28950, Version 85.4.3 Reporting Requirements for Pregnancies
5.4.3.1 Pregnancies in Female Patients
Female patients of ch ildbearing potential will be instructed to immediately inform the 
investigator if they become pregnant during the study or within 24 weeks after the last 
dose of study drug.  A paper Clinical Trial Pregnancy Reporting Form should be 
completed and submitted to the Sponsor or its designee immediately (i.e., no more than 
24 hours after learning of the pregnancy), either by faxing or by scanning and emailing 
the form using the fax number or email address provided to investigators.   Pregnancy 
should not be recor ded on the Adverse Event eCRF.  The investigator should 
discontinue study drug and counsel the patient, discussing the risks of the pregnancy 
and the possible effects on the fetus.  Monitoring of the patient should continue until 
conclusion of the pregnanc y.  Any serious adverse events associated with the 
pregnancy (e.g., an event in the fetus, an event in the mother during or after the 
pregnancy, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect in the child) should be reported on the 
Adverse Event eCRF.
In addition, t he investigator will submit a paper Clinical Trial Pregnancy Reporting Form 
when updated information on the course and outcome of the pregnancy becomes 
available.
5.4.3.2 Pregnancies in Female Partners of Male Patients
Male patients will be instructed through the Informed Consent Form to immediately 
inform the investigator if their partner becomes pregnant during the study or within 
24weeks after the last dose of study drug.   A paper Clinical Trial Pregnancy Reporting 
Form should be completed and submitted to the Sponsor or its designee immediately 
(i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the pregnancy), either by faxing or by 
scanning and emailing the form using the fax number or email address provided to 
investigators.   Attempts should be made to collect and report details of the course and 
outcome of any pregnancy in the partner of a male patient exposed to study drug.  When 
permitted by the site, the pregnant partner would need to sign an Authorization for Use 
and Disclosure of Pregnancy Health Information to allow for follow -up on her pregnancy.  
If the authorization has been signed, the investigator should submit a paper Clinical Trial 
Pregnancy Reporting Form when updated information on the course and outcome of the 
pregnancy becomes available .An inves tigator who is contacted by the male patient or 
his pregnant partner may provide information on the risks of the pregnancy and the 
possible effects on the fetus, to support an informed decision in cooperation with the 
treating physician and/or obstetrician .
5.4.3.3 Abortions
Any abortion should be classified as a serious adverse event ( as the Sponsor considers 
abortions to be medically significant), recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, and 
reported to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the 
event; see Section 5.4.2 ).
Etrolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd
114/Protocol GA28950, Version 85.4.3.4 Congenital A nomalies/Birth Defects
Any congenital anomaly/birth defect in a child born to a female patient or female partner 
of a male patient exposed to study drug should be classified as a serious adverse event, 
recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, and reported to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no 
more than 24 hours after learning of the event; see Section 5.4.2 ).
5.4.4 Reporting Requirements for Medical Device Complaints
See Section 4.3.6 for reporting requirements for medical devices.
5.5 FOLLOW -UP OF PA TIENT S AFTER ADVERSE EVENTS
5.5.1 Investigator Follow -Up
The investigator should follow each adverse event until the e vent has resolved to baseline 
grade or better, the event is assessed as stable by the investigator, the patient is lost to 
follow -up, or the patient withdraws consent.  Every effort should be made to follow all 
serious adverse events considered to be relat ed to study drug or trial -related procedures 
until a final outcome can be reported.
During the study period, resolution of adverse events (with dates) should be documented 
on the Adverse Event eCRF and in the patient’s medical record to facilitate source d ata 
verification.  
All pregnancies reported during the study should be followed until pregnancy outcome.
5.5.2 Sponsor Follow -Up
For serious adverse events, adverse events of special interest, and pregnancies, the 
Sponsor or a designee may follow up by telephone, fax, email, and/or a monitoring visit 
to obtain additional case details and outcome information (e.g., from hospital discharge 
summaries, consultant reports, autopsy reports) in order to perform an independent 
medical assessment of the reported case.
5.6 POST -STUDY ADVERSE EVE NTS
For p atients who enter the OLE -SM study ( Study GA28951 ), adverse event reporting
should follow the requirements for the OLE -SM study ( Study GA28951 ).
Post-study, if the patient does not enter OLE-SM study ( Study GA28951 ), the Sponsor
should benotifiedif the investigator becomes aware of any serious adverse event 
occurring after the end of the adverse event reporting period (defined as the last study 
visit [see Section 5.3.1]) if the event is believed to be related to prior study drug 
treatment. In addition, t he Sponsor should also be notified if the investigator becomes 
aware of any post -study events of confirmed or suspected PML, regardless of 
relationship to study drug, for up to 2 years after the patient’s last dose of study drug .
Etrolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd
115/Protocol GA28950, Version 8The investigator should report these events directly to Roche or its designee either by 
faxing or by scanning and emailing the paper Clinical Trial Serious Adverse 
Event /Adverse Event of Special Interest Reporting Form with use of the fax number sor 
email address provided to investigators .
5.7 EXPEDITED REPORTING TO HEA LTH AUTHORITIE S, 
INVESTIGA TORS, INSTI TUTIONA L REVIEW BOA RDS, A ND 
ETHICS COMMITTEES
The Sponsor will promptly evaluate all serious adverse events and adverse events of 
special interest against cumulative product experience to identify and expeditiously 
communicate possible new safety findings to investigators, IRBs, ECs, and applicable 
health authorities based on applicable legislation.
To determine reporting requirements for single adverse event cases, the Sponsor will 
assess the expectedness of these events for etrolizumab using the following reference 
document:
Etrolizumab Investigator's Brochure
Within the Investigator’s Brochure, the reference safety information is provided 
in Section 6 .4(Identified Risks and Adverse Drug Reactions [Reference Safety 
Information]).
The Sponsor will compare the severity of each event and the cumulative event 
frequency reported for the study with the severity and frequency reported in the 
applicable reference document.
Reporting requirements will also be based on the investigator's assessment of causality 
and seriousness, with all owance for upgrading by the Sponsor as needed.
All serious related (as asses sed by the investigator and/or S ponsor) adverse events 
occurring in a patient administered etrolizumab at any  time during the study and 
assessed as unexpected per the reference safety information will be considered 
Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions (SUSARs) for the purpose of 
regulatory reporting to all health authorities, with the exception of the FDA. For the FDA, 
SUSARs will be submitted as IND Safety Reports, in li ne with the FDA guidance “Safety 
Reporting Requirements for INDs and BA/BE Studies” dated December 2012.
The Sponsor will report all SUSARs into the EudraVigilance database in accordance 
with the ”Detailed guidance on the collection, verification and prese ntation of adverse 
event/reaction reports arising from clinical trials on medicinal products for human use 
(‘CT-3’).”
To satisfy local regulatory reporting criteria while maintaining the blind, investigators will 
be informed of all unexpected serious adver se events regardless of study drug 
assignment (i.e., they may also receive reports of patients on placebo).
Etrolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd
116/Protocol GA28950, Version 86. STATISTICA L CONSIDER ATIONS AND ANAL YSIS PLAN
For the purpose of statistical analyses, the Induction and Maintenance Phases will be 
treated as two independent studies.  The analysis of the Induction Phase will formally 
evaluate the efficacy and safety of 105 mg etrolizumab SC Q4 W versus placebo as an 
induction therapy.
The analysis of the Maintenance Phase will formally evaluate the efficacy and safety of 
105 mg etrolizumab SC Q4W  versus placebo as a maintenance therapy.
The analysis of data from the 66 -week treatment period (Induction and Maintenance 
Phases) will be performed when all data from this period are in the database and data 
have been cleaned and verified.
Whereas Sponsor personnel will be unblinded to treatment assignment to perform the 
primary analyses, patients and study site personnel will remain blinded to individual 
treatment assignment (for Cohort 2 patients and those re -randomized into the 
Maintenance Phase) until after the study is completed (after all patients have either 
completed the safety follow -up periods or discontinued early from the study) and the 
database is locked.
Detailed specifications of the statistical methods will be described in the Statistical 
Analysis Plan (SAP).
6.1 DETERMINA TION OF SA MPLE SIZE
The study sample size was selected so that sufficient patients are enrolled to evaluate 
the primary endpoints in the blinded Induction Phase and the Maintenance Phase 
respectively.  Approximately 605patients will be enrolled in the open- label induction arm 
(Cohort 1, n ≈130) or the blinded induction cohort (Cohort 2, n ≈475).
Cohort 2 patients will be randomized in a 4:1 ratio to etrolizumab (n ≈380) or placebo 
(n≈95).  Thi s will provide approximately 80% power to detect a 10% difference in 
remission rates at Week 14 between the etrolizumab and placebo arms, under the 
assumption of a placebo remission rate of 5% and a two -sided 2testat the 
5%significance level.
The primary endpoint for the Maintenance Phase is W eek 66 remission among patients
with a clinical response at Week 14.In total, it is estimated that approximately 
154 etrolizumab patients will achieve clinical response at the end of the Induction 
Phase and therefore will be randomized in the Maintenance Phase, under the 
assumption of a Week 14 clinical response rate of approximately 30% in the pooled 
etrolizumab induction group.
Etrolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd
117/Protocol GA28950, Version 8A sample size of 154 patients in the Maintenance Phase will provide 90% power to 
detect a 30% difference in remission rates between the two maintenance arms, under
the assumption of a placebo W eek 66 remission rate 10% and a Fisher exact test at 
the 5% significance level .  
The planned approximately 510etrolizumab patients from Cohort 1 and Cohort 2 would 
provide approximately 154patients with a clinical response at Week14, under the 
assumption of a Week 14 clinical response rate of at least 30%in the pooled (Cohort 1 
and Cohort 2) etrolizumab inducti on group.  Additional patients may be enrolled into 
Cohort 1, if needed, to achieve this target number of approximately 154 patients 
randomized into the Maintenance Phas e.
For the purpose of statistical analyses and sample size calculations, the Induction and 
Maintenance Phases will be treated as two independent studies, and as such no 
adjustment to alpha is required.
6.2 SUMMA RIES OF CONDUCT OF STUDY
The number of patients rand omized and re -randomized will be tabulated by study site 
and treatment arm.  Patient disposition (the number of patients randomized, treated, and 
completing each study period) will be tabulated by treatment arm.  Reasons for 
premature study drug discontinuation or withdrawal from study, any eligibility criteria 
deviations, and other major protocol deviations will be summarized by treatment arm.
6.3 SUMMA RIES OF TREA TME NT GROUP COMPA RABILITY
Demographic and baseline characteristics such as age, sex, race, region, use of 
corticosteroids and immunosuppressants, duration of disease, and MCS and its 
subscores will be summarized for all randomized patients by treatment group by use of 
descriptive s tatistics for both the Induction and Maintenance Phases.  Exposure to study 
drug (number of study treatments and duration of treatment) will be summarized by 
treatment arm.
6.4 EFFICA CY ANAL YSES
Efficacy analyses for the Induction Phase will be performed using a modified 
intent -to-treat analysis set including all patients randomized in Cohort 2 who 
received at least one dose of study drug with patients grouped according to the 
treatment assigned at randomization.
Efficacy analyses for the Maintenance Phase will be performed using a modified 
intent -to-treat analysis set including patients randomized in the Maintenance Phase 
with patients grouped according to the treatment assigned at randomization.
Etrolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd
118/Protocol GA28950, Version 8To manage the overall type I error, the primary and secondary end points within the 
Induction and Maintenance Phases, respectively, will be tested sequentially.  Within 
each of the Induction and Maintenance Phases, respectively, the primary endpoint 
will be tested first at a two -sided 5% significance level.  A small number of 
secondary endpoints will then be tested, sequentially, conditional on positive results 
for the corresponding primary endpoint and any preceding secondary endpoints.  
The remaining secondary endpoints and all exploratory endpoints will be considered 
to provide supportive information and no adjustments for multiple comparisons will 
be performed.  All endpoints will be assessed at a nominal two- sided 5% 
significance level.
Patients who are non -evaluable for efficacy at a specific timepoint (e.g., due to missing 
data or transfer to Part 1 [OLE] of the OLE-SMprotocol [Study GA28951] ) will be 
considered non -responders for all response/remission type endpoints.  In addition, for 
the Maintenance Phase, patients who initiated an agent not allowed in combinati on with 
etrolizumab (see Section 4.4.2 ), an immunosuppressant or corticosteroid (administered 
for the treatment of UC), or had an increase in dose over baseline levels for treatment of 
worsening disease symptoms will be considered non-responders thereafter.  In the 
Induction Phase, initiation of an agent not allowed in combination with etrolizumab, an 
immunosuppressant, oral or topical 5 -ASA, corticosteroid, or increase in dose over 
baseline levels will lead to non -responder classi fication. 
For continuous outcomes (e.g., IBDQ, UC -PRO/SS), scores after the first use of rescue 
medication will be imputed using the worst post -baseline score from the following 
assessments:  the last score available prior to the start date of first rescu e medication 
and all scores available after the start date of rescue medication use.
In addition to the analyses described herein and in Sections 6.4.1 and 6.4.2 , the 
following analyses will be performed for the primary efficacy endpoint and key secondary 
efficacy en dpoints. Details of these analyses will be described in the SAP:
Sensitivity analyses to evaluate the robustness of results to the primary analysis 
methods (e.g., handling of dropouts)
Subgroup analyses to evaluate the consistency of results across pre -specified
subgroups (e.g., based on age, sex, race/ethnicity, baseline UC medications, 
baseline CS dose).
Further details, including additional missing data handling rules, will be provided in the 
SAP.
Etrolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd
119/Protocol GA28950, Version 86.4.1 Primary  Efficacy  Endpoint
In the Induction Phase, the pr oportion of patients from Cohort 2 in remission at W eek14 
will be compared between the etrolizumab and placebo arms with use of the 
Cochran- Mantel -Haenszel test statistic stratified by the factors used at randomization:  
concomitant treatment with corticosteroids (yes/no), concomitant treatment with 
immunosuppressants (yes/no), and baseline disease activity (MCS 9/MCS 10).
The primary endpoint for the Maintenance Phase is W eek 66 remission among patients 
with a clinical response at Week 14.  Patients who are randomized into the 
maintenance phase (i.e., clinical responders at Week 14) will be evaluated.   The 
difference in remission rates between the etrolizumab and placebo arms will be 
compared using the Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel test statistic stratified by induction cohort 
(1, 2), concomitant treatment with corticosteroids (yes/no), and baseline disease activity 
(MCS 9/MCS 10).  The Fisher exact test will be used as a sensitivity analysis.
6.4.2 Secondary  Efficacy Endpoints
The secondary efficacy endpoints for this Induction Phase are as follows :
Proportion of patients in clinical remission at W eek 14
Proportion of patients with clinical response at Week 14
Proportion of patients with improvement in endoscopic appearance of the mucosa at 
Week14
Proportion of patients in endoscopic remission at W eek 14

All the responder/remitter secondary endpoints will be analyzed in the same fashion as 
the primary endpoint. The continuous secondary endpoints will be analyzed using an 
analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with the factors used at randomization into the 
Induction/Maintenance Pha ses as stratification variables and the baseline value of the 
studied measure as a covariate. Baseline is defined here as the last available value 
prior to treatment in the Induction/Maintenance Phases.
Further details regarding the analysis of the secondary endpoints will be provided in the 
SAP.

6.5 SAFETY ANAL YSES
The safety analysis population for the Induction Phase will consist of all patients who 
received at least one dose of study drug during the Induction Phase with patients 
grouped according to the treatment actually received (open -label etrolizumab, blinded 
etrolizumab, or blinded placebo). 
The safety analysis population for the Maintenance Phase will consist of all patients 
random ized into the Maintenance Phase with patients grouped according to the 
treatment actually received during the Maintenance Phase.
Safety will be assessed through descriptive summaries of adverse events, laboratory 
test results (serum chemistry, hematology including complete blood count with 
differential and platelet counts, and urinalysis), and antibodies to etrolizumab.
6.5.1 Adverse Events
Verbatim descriptions of treatment -emergent adverse events will be coded and their 
incidence will be summarized by treatment arm, as appropriate.  A treatment -emergent 
adverse event is defined as any new adverse event reported or any worsening of an 
existing condition on or after the first dose of study drug.  In addition, separate 
summaries will be generated for serious adverse events, deaths, and adverse events 
leading to discontinuation of study drug. Adverse events will be s ummarized by mapped 
term, appropriate thesaurus level, and toxicity grade.
Analyses will be performed for:
Systemic hypersensitivity events
Specific analyses will be performed for anaphylactic reactions using the 
anaphylactic reaction Sampson’s criteria (see Appendix 8).
Serious infections
The frequency of serious infections, in particular GI infections ,will be 
summarized for each treatment arm.
Opportunistic infections
The occurrence of opportunistic infections will be summarized for each 
treatment arm.

will be tabulated and plotted.  The serum pharmacokinetics of etrolizumab will be 
summarized with a mean serum concentration at steady state (trough) and at the two 
primary endpoint times (W eeks 14 and 66).  Estimates for these parameters will be 
tabulated and summarized (mean, standard deviation, coefficient of variation, median, 
minimum, and maximum).
Additional PK analyses may be conducted as appropriate.
PD and biomarkers analyses will include examination of changes over time in 
exploratory biomarkers post -treatment.  Results will be summarized descriptively.
7. DATA COLLECTION A ND MANAGEMENT
7.1 DATA QUA LITY ASSURA NCE
Sponsor, CRO, and Data Management vendor will be responsible for the data 
management of this study, including quality checking of the data.  Sites will be 
responsible for data entry into an eCRF via the EDC system.  In the event of discrepant 
data, data queries will be issued to the sit es and resolved by the sites via the EDC 
system.  The Sponsor will produce an EDC Study Specification document that describes 
the quality checking to be performed on the data.  In addition, eCRF Help Text will be 
provided to the sites through the EDC system.  eCRFs and correction documentation will 
be maintained in the EDC system’s audit trail.
Etrolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd
123/Protocol GA28950, Version 8Central laboratory data will be transferred directly to the Sponsor, with use of the 
Sponsor’s standard procedures to handle and process the electronic transfer of t hese 
data.
7.2 ELECTRONIC CA SE REPO RT FORMS 
eCRFs are to be completed using a Sponsor -designated EDC system.  Sites will receive 
training and have access to Help Text in Medidata RAVE for appropriate eCRF 
completion.  eCRFs will be submitted electronically to the Sponsor and should be 
handled in accordance with instructions from the Sponsor.
All eCRFs should be completed by designated, trained site staff.  eCRFs should be 
reviewed and electronically signed and dated by the i nvestigator or a designee.
At the end of the study, the investigator will receive patient data for his or her site in a 
readable format on a compact disc that must be kept with the study records.  
Acknowledgement of receipt of the compact disc is required.
7.3 ELECTRONIC PA TIENT -REPORTED OUTCOME DA TA
Patient -reported data will be collected electronically through use of electronic devices 
provided by an ePRO vendor .  The electronic device s are designed for entry of data in a 
way that is attributable, secure, and accurate, in compliance with U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) regulations for electronic records (21 Code of Federal Regulations, 
Part 11).  The data will be transmitted to a cent ralized database at the ePRO vendor.  
The data from the ePRO devices are available for view access only via secure access to 
a Web portal provided by the ePRO vendor.  Only identified and trained users may view 
the data, and their actions become part of th e audit trail.  The Sponsor will have view 
access only.  Regular data transfers will occur from the centralized database at the 
vendor to the database at the Sponsor.
Once the study is complete, the ePRO data, audit trail, and trial and system 
documentation will be archived.  The Sponsor will receive all data entered by patient on 
the e -diary and tablet device and all the study documentation.
Details regarding patient reported data and the electronic device s are available in the 
Study Reference Manual.  Sys tem backups for data stored by the Sponsor and records 
retention for the study data will be consistent with the Sponsor’s standard procedures.
7.4 SOURCE DA TA DOCUMENT ATION
Study monitors will perform ongoing source data verification to confirm that critical 
protocol data (i.e., source data) entered into the eCRFs by authorized site personnel are 
accurate, complete, and verifiable from source documents.
Source documents (paper or electronic) are those in which patient data are recorded 
and documented for the fi rst time.  They include but are not limited to hospital records, 
Etrolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd
124/Protocol GA28950, Version 8clinical and office charts, laboratory notes, memoranda, PRO questionnaires , evaluation 
checklists, pharmacy dispensing records, recorded data from automated instruments, 
copies of transcriptions that are certified after verification as being accurate and 
complete, microfiche, photographic negatives, microfilm or magnetic media, X -rays, 
MRIs, ECGs , patient files, and records kept at pharmacies, laboratories, and 
medico -technical departments in volved in a clinical trial.
Before study initiation, the types of source documents that are to be generated will be 
clearly defined in the Trial Monitoring Plan.  This includes any protocol data to be 
entered directly into the eCRFs (i.e., no prior written or electronic record of the data) and 
considered source data.
Source documents that are required to verify the validity and completeness of data 
entered into the eCRFs must not be obliterated or destroyed and must be retained per 
the policy for retention of records described in Section 7.6.
To facilitate source data verification, the investigators and institutions must provide the 
Spon sor direct access to applicable source documents and reports for trial -related 
monitoring, Sponsor audits, and IRB/EC review.  The investigational site must also allow 
inspection by applicable health authorities.
7.5 USE OF COMPUTERIZED SYSTEMS
When clinical o bservations are entered directly into an investigational site’s 
computerized medical record system (i.e., in lieu of original hardcopy records), the 
electronic record can serve as the source document if the system has been validated in 
accordance with heal th authority requirements pertaining to computerized systems used 
in clinical research.  An acceptable computerized data collection system allows 
preservation of the original entry of data.  If original data are modified, the system should 
maintain a viewa ble audit trail that shows the original data as well as the reason for the 
change, name of the person making the change, and date of the change.
7.6 RETENTION OF RECORDS
Records and documents pertaining to the conduct of this study and the distribution of 
IMP,including eCRFs, patient data (including PRO), Informed Consent Forms, 
laboratory test results, and medication inventory records, must be retained by the 
Principal Investigator for at least 15 years after completion or discontinuation of the 
study or for the length of time required by relevant national or local health authorities, 
whichever is longer.  After that period of time, the documents may be destroyed, subject 
to local regulations.
No records may be disposed of without the written approval of the S ponsor.  W ritten 
notification should be provided to the Sponsor prior to transferring any records to 
another party or moving them to another location.

inspection of study data, patients’ medical records, and eCRFs.  The investigator will 
permit national and local health authorities, Sponsor monitors, representatives, and 
collaborators, and the IRBs/ECs to inspect f acilities and records relevant to this study.
9.4 ADMINISTRA TIVE STRUC TURE
This trial is sponsored by F. Hoffmann La Roche Ltd .  Approximately 225international 
study centers will participate in this study to enroll approximately 605patients.
A contract research organization (CRO) will be contracted to manage the study and 
perform monitoring activities.
Centralized facilities (vendors) will be used to collect QOL data and endoscopy reading 
and interpretation; however, the investigator or a designee will also read the endoscopy 
if required for clinically indicated safety reasons.
A central laboratory (i.e., Roche or a vendor) will be used for most laboratory 
assessments, including histologic grading of colonic biopsies as per the laboratory 
manual.  A sele cted group of assessments will be performed on site or by a local 
laboratory.
The eCRF data will be recorded via a Sponsor -designated EDC system.  An IxRS will be 
used for study drug inventory management and to randomize patients to study drug.
An iDMC wil l be established to perform regular review of the safety data to ensure the 
ongoing safety of participating patients.  Its composition and a description of its 
responsibilities will be provided in an iDMC charter.
9.5 PUBLICA TION OF DATA  AND PROTECTION OF TR ADE 
SECRETS
Regardless of the outcome of a trial, the Sponsor is dedicated to openly providing 
information on the trial to healthcare professionals and to the public, both at scientific 
congresses and in peer -reviewed journals. The Sponsor will comply with all 
requirements for publication of study results. For more information, refer to the Roche 
Global Policy on Sharing of Clinical Trials Data at the following website: 
http://www.roche.com/roche_global_policy_on_sharing_of_clinical_study_information.pdf
The results of this study may be published or presented at scientific congresses. For all 
clinical trials in patients involving an IMP for which a marketing authorization application 
has been filed or approved in any country, the Sponsor aims to submit a j ournal 
manuscript reporting primary clinical trial results within 6 months after the availability of 
the respective clinical study report. In addition, for all clinical trials in patients involving 
an IMP for which a marketing authorization application ha s been filed or approved in any 
Etrolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd
129/Protocol GA28950, Version 8country, the Sponsor aims to publish results from analyses of additional endpoints and 
exploratory data that are clinically meaningful and statistically sound.
The investigator must agree to submit all manuscripts or abstra cts to the Sponsor prior 
to submission for publication or presentation.  This allows the Sponsor to protect 
proprietary information and to provide comments based on information from other 
studies that may not yet be available to the investigator.
In accord ance with standard editorial and ethical practice, the Sponsor will generally 
support publication of multicenter trials only in their entirety and not as individual center 
data.  In this case, a coordinating investigator will be designated by mutual agreem ent.
Authorship will be determined by mutual agreement and in line with International 
Committee of Medical Journal Editors authorship requirements.  Any formal publication 
of the study in which contribution of Sponsor personnel exceeded that of conventiona l 
monitoring will be considered as a joint publication by the investigator and the 
appropriate Sponsor personnel.

136/Protocol GA28950, Version 8Notes:  Study assessments and blood draws are to be conducted prior to study drug administration.
All colonic bio psy samples will be taken during flexible sigmoidoscopy/colonoscopy procedure.
aAll assessments must be performed after obtaining informed consent.  Endoscopy should be performed 4 16 days prior to Day 1 (i.e., Day 16 to Day 4).  The 
total screening period is 35 days. Under no circumstances will either window be extended.
bDay 1 of W eek 0.
cTelephone contact for patients performing home administration :  patients requiring in -clinic drug administration throughout the study will have their study 
assessments conduc ted in clinic or via telephone call after their clinic visit at the sites’ discretion.
dUnscheduled visit represents a visit that is not as per Schedule of Assessments and is required for an adverse event or for p otential relapse assessment.  All 
indicate d assessments are NOT performed at each unscheduled visit.  Assessments would be symptom -driven (e.g., perform PML neurological examination only 
if patient reports symptoms suspected of PML; and confirmation of clinical relapse is performed by the Mayo Cli nic Score assessment).  Assessments 
corresponding to items noted in this column should be recorded on the eCRF.
ePerform prior to first administration of study drug.
fSerum test at screening for all female patients except those who are more than 1 -year p ostmenopausal or are surgically sterile.  Urine test at all other visits; if 
urine test result is positive, perform a confirmatory serum test.  Pregnancy test will be carried out at home once patient st arts etrolizumab administration at home.  
Patient is t o report the pregnancy test result via e-diary.  Patients must be instructed at screening and reminded throughout the study that in case of positive 
pregnancy test result they must stop self -administration of study drug and call the site immediately.  Do n ot administer etrolizumab unless the serum pregnancy 
test result is negative.
gNot required if normal chest X –ray result within 3 months prior to screening.
hFull physical examination required at screening; symptom-driven physical examination at all othe r timepoints indicated.
iPML neurologic exam consists of the PML Subjective Checklist and the PML Objective Checklist. Administer before other assessments , as per Appendix 5.  
jNot required if unscheduled visit leads to withdrawal and assessment previously conducted at unscheduled visit.
kThe following tests are acceptable screening assays for latent TB in this study:  purified protein derivative (a tuberculin skin test reaction; e.g., Mantoux test), 
INF- based test (e.g., QuantiFERON-TB Gold).
lPatients must undergo screening for HBV and hepatitis C. This includes testing for HBsAg (HBV surface antigen), anti -HBc total (HBV core antibody total), and 
hepatitis C antibody.
mEnrolled patients who are Hepatitis B Core Antibody positive should have Hepatitis B DNA measured at these timepoints.
nMeasurement of HCV RNA with use of the Am plicor assay is required when the patient has a known history of HCV antibody positivity with past documentation 
of undetectable HCV RNA, either with or without history of anti-viral treatment.  Patients with newly diagnosed HCV antibody positivity are not eligible for this 
study and, therefore, do not require measurement of HCV RNA.
oThe PK, ATA, and exploratory PD sample collections will be from all patients during the Induction Phase.  During the Maintenance Phase, PK , ATA ,and 
exploratory PD samples will only be collected from patients who were randomized into the Maintenance Phase.
Appendix 1
Schedule of A ssessments (cont.)
Etrolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd
137/Protocol GA28950, Version 8pIf serum sickness or a clinically significant allergic drug reaction is suspected, Sponsor should be notified and serum for e trolizumab level and ATAs should be 
drawn and sent to the central laboratory.  ATA samples may also be utilized for exploratory PD assessments or assessment of d rug concentrations .
qCollection of sample for ATA is required at final or early withdrawal visit, unless it co incides with first visit in Part 1 of Study GA28951 (where a sample for ATA 
must be collected).
rA blood sample to test for antibodies to JCV will be taken and stored for possible later assessment of how widespread the JCV infection is in the study 
popula tion.  Sample testing for the presence of JCV antibodies is not helpful in predicting risk for PML or for evaluating neurolog ic symptoms.  The sample may 
be tested if there is a strong belief that this information will be helpful in managing a patient's co ndition.
sEndoscopy rectal bleeding assessment stool frequency assessment Physician’s Global Assessment (PGA) .  Patients who have not undergone full 
colonoscopy with documented results within 1 year prior to screening should undergo colonoscopy in lieu of sigmoidoscopy at the screening visit to allow for 
screening for cancer/dysplasia (yes/no).
tScreening endoscopy (for the MCS) should be performed 4 16days prio r to Day 1 (i.e., Day 16 to Day 4).  For baseline measurements, the PGA will be 
obtained only once, on Day 1 (prior to randomization), and the PGA sub score will be used to calculate both the baseline (screening) MCS and the baseline (Day 
1) pMCS .
uPartial MCS during screening is defined as the MCS score excluding the endoscopy scor e (i.e., rectal bleeding assessment stool frequency 
assessment PGA ).
vFor culture and sensitivity testing; ova, parasites, and Clostridium difficile toxin testing.
wSample analyses may include , but arenot limited to, analyses of fecal calprotectin and other exploratory PD biomarkers (such as analyses of themicrobiota and 
bacterial cultures) .
xIF REQUIRED:   If there is suspicion fo r clinically significant CMV colitis, o ne biopsy sample should be obtained from the base of the ulcer to evaluate for 
histological presence of CMV.  Analysis should be performed locally if possible, or can be sent to a central lab if necessary.  Result must be negative for CMV 
prior to dosing on Day 1. 
yIF REQUIRED:   If patient does not have previously documented histopathologic confirmation of UC as defined in the inclusion criteria , one biopsy sample can be 
obtained from the base of the ulcer and read locally for histopathologic confirmation of UC.
zIn addition to the optional biopsy noted in footnote “ x” and “y” above, 5 pairs (10 biopsy samples) will be obtained at screening (all taken from the most inflamed 
area of the colon within 20 -40 cm of the anal verge [sigmoid]).   These five biopsy pairs will be sent to the central laboratory for further storage or distribution.  
Two pairs will be placed in a stabilization buffer (such as RNAlater or a similar buffer) and stored at 80C (1 pair for diagnostic qPCR and 1 pair for PD 
biomarkers).  In UK si tes ONLY, one of the latter pair of biopsies (2 samples) will be placed in storage solution at 4°C and shipped to the UK laboratory .  The 
other 3 pairs will be placed in formalin and then paraffin embedded ; these biopsy samples will be used for exploratory PD biomarkers and /ordiagnostic 
biomarkers. Original biopsy location and endoscopic depth should be clearly indicated .

these biopsy samples will be used for exploratory PD biomarkers and /ordiagnostic biomarkers. Original biopsy location and endoscopic depth should be clearly 
indicated.
bbPaxgene blood RNA samples must be collected after all other blood and serum samples.
ccDuring screening, patients must be trained on the use of the e -diary.  Patients are to complete the e-diary on a daily basis for the stool frequency and rectal 
bleeding score (for MCS/pMCS) , starting from thefirst screening visit , andfor at least 9 12 consecutive days around the time of each scheduled visit for the 
UC-PRO/SS.
ddWith the exception of W eek 0, the IBDQ and the EQ -5D will be completed in the clinic by the patient after the PML neurological examination but before any other 
non-PRO assessments and before the patient receives any disease-status information or study drug during that visit.
eeRandomization to occur within 2 weeks starting from Week 14 timepoint.

141/Protocol GA28950, Version 8DATA COLLECTION REQUIREMENTS 
Data will be collected on e -diary and other electronic media; during conversion to 
these media the format of the questions may  change
A CRITICAL DATA POINT TAKEN AT BASELINE IS THE PATIENT’S NORMAL 
NUMBER OF STOOLS.  This is defined as the number of stool passed when a 
patient is in remission/not in flare.  This is to be taken from the most recent available 
data in the patient’s medical notes or taken during patient interview at screening.
This value will remain stable throughout the study.
Normal number of stools is to be rounded up (e.g., normal number of stools 12
would be rounded to 2) 
The NORMAL number of stools is to be record ed on the e- diary and made visible to 
the patient to assist with their scoring relative to this number 
NOTE:  Data recorded during bowel preparation procedures and day of endoscopy is to 
be ignored (bowel preparation and endoscopy procedure days are to be loaded into the 
e-diary by the patient and excluded from the MCS calculation).
1.Stool Frequency 
Stool frequency is to be recorded daily from start of screening to the end of the 
study in the e -diary 
The stool frequency is to be compared with the patien t's normal stool frequency and 
entered as a score between 0 and 3 (see 1 above) (e.g., a patient normally has 1 
stool per day and today has 4 stools, therefore, the patient has 3 stools more than 
“normal,” which yields a value of 2 for that day).
The stool frequency will be defined as the passage of solid or liquid fecal material.  
Episodes of incontinence count.  A non -productive trip to the bathroom or the simple 
passage of gas DOES NOT COUNT as stool. 
The baseline stool frequency value will be taken fro m patient e- diary recordings that 
are entered between Day 22 (inclusive) and bowel preparation for the screening 
endoscopy and will be calculated as the average (rounded to the nearest integer) 
from the three most recent stool frequency scores that were e ntered just prior to the 
day of bowel preparation.  However, up to three post -endoscopy scores, starting 
with the score recorded 2 days after the endoscopy , may be used to calculate 
baseline stool frequency, but ONLY when fewer than three scores are available 
between Day 22 and bowel preparation (see Figure 1below) .  The days selected 
for this calcu lation are intended to prevent the use of stool frequency recordings 
during the screening period that are impacted by bowel preparation and endoscopy, 
including the day immediately following the endoscopy .
Appendix 3
Mayo Clinic Score Measurement (cont.)
Etrolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd
142/Protocol GA28950, Version 8The post -baseline stool frequency value for endpo int assessment will be calculated as 
theaverage (rounded to the nearest integer) from the three most recent stool frequency 
scores that were entered in the e -diary within the 7days prior to the clinic visit and prior 
to the days devoted to bowel preparation andendoscopy. 
2.Rectal Bleeding 
Rectal bleeding is to be recorded daily from screening to the end of the study in the 
e-diary. 
The rectal bleeding score is to be categorized from 0 3 according to the definition 
given in 2 above. 
Patients are to be instructed to ignore any blood that is caused by menstruation or 
hemorrhoids.
The baseline value for the rectal bleeding score will be taken from patient e -diary 
recordings that are entered between Day 22 (inclusive) and bowel preparation for 
the screening endoscopy and will be determined by the worst recording from the 
three most recent scores that were entered just prior to the day of bowel preparation.  
However, up to three post -endoscopy scores, starting with the score recorded 2 
days after the endoscopy , may be used to calculate baseline rectal bleeding, but 
ONLY when fewer than three scores are available between Day 22 and bowel 
preparation (see Figure 1below) .  The days selected for this calculation are 
intended to prevent the use of rectal bleeding recordings during the screening 
period that are impacted by bowel preparation and endoscopy, including the day 
immediately following the endoscopy .
The post -baseline rectal bleeding value for endpoint assessment will be determined by 
the worst of the three most recent rectal bleeding scores that were entered inthe e-
diary within the 7days prior to the clinic visit and prio r to the days devoted to bowel 
preparation and endoscopy. 
3.Endoscopy  Subscore 
This score is provided by the endoscopy reading vendor as a subscore of 0 to 3. 
Findings on endoscopy will be documented by photographic evidence (central 
reading of endoscopy videos) 
The score will be based upon the worst affected segme nt (if mucosal appearance 
varies) for study conduct, e xcept at post -baseline time points, when the sigmoid 
colon MCS endoscopic subscore will be used if the baseline sigmoid colon MCS 
endoscopic subscore is 2 3.
Note:  The time window for performing endoscopy during the screening is 416days 
prior to Day 1 (i.e., Day 16 to Day 4).

143/Protocol GA28950, Version 84.Physician 'sGlobal A ssessment 
The Physician’s Global Assessment (PGA) WILL: 
Be based on the patient’s overall status  
Reflect how the patient is doing at present.  Assessment SHOULD NOT reflect past 
disease severity or complexity or the number/kinds of medicines the patient is 
receiving 
Be based on the: 
Rectal bleeding score, s tool frequency score, and endoscopic evaluation 
Patient’s recollection of abdominal discomfort and general sense of well -being 
Patient’s performance status, fecal incontinence, and mood 
Physician’s observations and physical examination findings 
Reflect disease activity NOT disease severity (e.g., do not automatically give a high 
PGA to patients with pancolitis or severe/complicated disease or patients requiring 
multiple medications 
The PGA will be provided by the Investigator as a score of 0 to3 and entered into the 
tablet. 
CALCULA TION OF THE MA YO CLINIC SCORE 
Timepoints for MCS assessments can be found in the protocol Schedule of 
Assessments 
1.Eligibility  for Enrollment 
Moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis as determined by a May o Clinic 
Score of 6 12 with an endoscopic subscore 2 and a rectal bleeding subscore 1, 
and a stool frequency subscore 1.  
2.Achievement of Clinical Response at Week 14 
MCS with 3-point decrease and 30% reduction from baseline as well as 1-point 
decrease in rectal bleeding subscore or an absolute score 0 or 1 
3.Identification of Clinical Relapse 
Clinical relapse is defined as an increase in pMCS 3 points compared with 
induction timepoint (W eek 14) AND absolute pMCS of 5 AND an endoscopy 
subscore of 2

MCS 5, an endoscopy would be conducted and endoscopy subscore and full MCS 
calculated 
E-DIARY MA LFUNCTION OR LOSS
The help desk for the e -diary vendor (CRF Health) should be contacted in the event of 
e-diary malfunction or loss.  Until a working e -diary can be provided to the patient, site 
staff should, after the e -diary malfunction or loss, retrospectively collect the previous 
day's stool freque ncy and rectal bleeding subscores from the patient via telephone 
interview within the next working day following the e- diary failure or loss.  These data will 
then be transcribed into a data clarification form within CRF Health’s TrialManager 
system for ap proval.

Childbearing Potential, Pregnancy  Testing, and Contraception
All women of childbearing potential (including those who have had a tubal ligation) will 
have a serum pregnancy test at screening and a urine pregnancy test prior to 
administration of study drug at subsequent visits. If a urine pregnancy test result is 
positive, study drug will not be administered until pregnancy is ruled out.  The result 
must be confirmed by a serum pregnancy test (cond ucted by the central laboratory). 
Refer to Section 5.4.3 of the protocol for management of a patient with a confirmed 
pregnancy.
All female patients are considered to be of childbearing potential unless they meet one 
of the following criteria:
The patient has been post -menopausal (non -therapy -induced amenorrhea) for at 
least 12 months
The patient had a surgical bilateral oophorectomy (wi th or without hysterectomy) 
more than 6 weeks prior to enrollment
The patient had a hysterectomy
Female patients of reproductive or childbearing potential who are unwilling to use a 
highly effective method of contraception or remain abstinent during the t reatment period, 
and for at least 24 weeks after the last dose of study drug  will be excluded from study 
participation.  
Abstinence is only acceptable if it is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of 
the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., cal endar, ovulation, symptothermal, or 
postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of 
contraception.  
Examples of highly effective contraception include the following:
Combined oral contraceptive pill 
Contraceptive transdermal patch
Intrauterine device
Implants for contraception
Injections for contraception (with prolonged release)
Hormonal vaginal device
Sterilization, surgical tubal ligation
Appendix 4
Childbearing Potential, Pregnancy  Testing,
and Contraception (cont.)
Etrolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd
148/Protocol GA28950, Version 8Sole sexual partner consisting of surgically sterilized male partner with appropriate 
post-surgical verification of the absence of spermatozoa in the ejaculate
Double barrier methods: condom andocclusive cap (diaphragm or cervical/vault 
caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository (Note: a female condom 
and male condom should not be used together as friction between the two can 
result in either product failing)
Patients may provide verbal confirmation that the partner completed appropriate follow -
up after vasectomy. Sites are not required to obtain partner medical records.
For me n: agreement to remain abstinent (refrain from heterosexual intercourse) or use 
contraceptive measures and agreement to refrain from donating sperm, as defined 
below:
With female partners of childbearing potential or pregnant female partners, men must 
remain abstinent or use a condom during the treatment period and for at least 24 weeks 
after the last dose of study drug.  Men must refrain from donating sperm during this 
same period.
For men and women : The reliability of sexual abstinence should be evaluat ed in relation 
to the duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient.  
Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or postovulation methods) 
and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.

Clinical Criteria for Diagnosing Anaphy laxis
These criteria are taken from a su mmary re port fro m the second symposium on th e 
definition and ma nage ment of a naph ylaxis, conducted by the Natio nal Institute of Allerg y 
and Infectious Disease/Food A llergy and Anaphylaxis Network.1  Anaphylaxis is highl y 
likely when any one of the fo llowing three criteria is fulf illed:
1.Acute onsetof anillness (minutesto several hours) with invol vementof the ski n, 
mucosal tissue,or both (e.g. , genera lized hi ves, prurit usorflushin g, swollen
lips-tongue-uvul a)
AND AT LE AST ONE O F THEFOLLOWING:
Respiratory compromise (e.g., dyspnea , wheeze-br onchosp asm, stridor , reduce d 
peakexpiratory flow, hypoxemia)
Reduced blood pr essu reor as sociatedsy mptoms o f end-org an dy sfunction (e.g. , 
hypotonia , syncope,incontinence)
2.Two o r more of the follo wing that occu r rapidly afte r exposure to a likely a lle rgen fo r 
that patien t (minutes to severa l hours):
Involvement of the skin-mucosa l tissue (e.g., genera lized hives, itch-flush, swolle n 
lips-tongue-uvula)
Respiratory compromise (e.g., dyspnea, wh eeze-br onchospasm, stridor, reduce d 
p
eak expiratory flow, hypoxemia)
Reduced blood pressure or associated symptoms (e.g., hypotonia, syncope , 
incont
inence)
Persiste ntgast rointesti nalsymptoms (e.g. , crampy ab domi nal pai n, vomiti ng) 
3.Reduced blood pr essu re aft er expo sure to k nown a llergen f or that patie nt (minutes to
several hours):
Infants and children: low systolic blood pressure (a ge specific)2or greate r than 30 % 
decrease in s ystolic blood pressure
Adults: systolic blood pressure of less than 90 mmHg or greater than 30% decrease 
from that person’s baseline

Nancy Histologic alIndex
Histologic activity on colon biopsies will be measured using the Nancy histological 
index (below). Histologic remission is defined as a Nancy histological index of 0 1 
based on consensus guidelines recommending that histologic remission should be 
defined by the absence of neutrophils in the crypts and lamina propria.
Nancy Histologic alIndex (NHI)
Marker Assessment NHI Grade
Erosion or ulceration Present 4: Severely active disease
Acute inflammatory 
infiltrateModerate to severe 3: Moderately active disease
Mild 2: Mildly active disease
Chronic inflammatory 
infiltrateModerate or marked 
increase1: Chronic inflammatory infiltrate with no 
acute inflammatory infiltrate
No or mild increase 0: No histologically significant disease
Histologic remission: NHI 1

Summary  of Protocol  Modifications  and Dates : 
 
Randomization  sequence  had to be revised on  May 10, 2017  and again  on February  9, 2018  to 
accommodate a supplier (National Institute on Drug  Abuse) shortage of two doses of research 
cigarettes  (0.12 mg/g  non-menthol  and 0.8 mg  menthol cigarettes).  We over-assigned to the  
0.03 mg non-menthol  dose  during  this shortage  and then to the two doses  that were  in short 
supply once they became available again.  To accommodate any potential influence on 
outcomes, menthol cigarette use was included as a covariate in all analyses.  
 
 
Note:  
 
This study in people with affective disorders was also conducted in two additional vulnerable 
populations (people with opioid use disorder, socioeconomically disadvantaged women) under 
a similar protocol, with differences between protocols consisting of da ta collection specific to a 
particular vulnerable population. This included information such as use and timing of opioid 
maintenance therapy for individuals with opioid -use disorder and other measures relevant to 
disadvantaged women of reproductive age. In  order to explore potential differences across 
individuals with different vulnerabilities, data from all three studies were combined for analysis. 
A vulnerable population -by-condition or population -by-condition -by-time interaction term was 
included in all analyses. In the event that these interaction terms were statistically significant, all  
pairwise comparisons were conducted using a Bonferroni multiple comparison adjustment.

8  Protocol 
Objective : 
The primary overall objective of this study is to evaluate the effects of extended exposure to 
cigarettes differing in nicotine content in smokers with mood and anxiety disorders using a 3 - 
condition,  parallel  groups  design.  After  a baseline  period  in which  daily smoking  rate and other 
baseline assessments are complet ed, participants will be randomly assigned to one of three 
cigarette conditions (nicotine content averaged across menthol and non -menthol cigarettes: 
0.03, 0.12, and 0.8 mg machine estimated nicotine  delivery per cigarette ) for the 12 -week 
experimental per iod. 
 
Background  Information:  
The 2009 Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act (FSPTCA) gave the Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA) regulatory authority over tobacco products, including nicotine levels 
in cigarettes.  That is an exciting development as it creates the opportunity to examine the 
Benowitz and Henningfield (1994) hypothesis that smoking prevalence, nicotine dependence, 
and smoking -related morbidity and mortality can be lowered substantially by reducing the 
nicotine  content  of cigarettes  to non-addictive  levels.  Computer  modeling  predicts  that reducing 
nicotine levels in cigarettes would produce substantial improvements in population health 
(Tengs et al., 2005).  An essential initial step towards the implement ation of such a policy is to 
thoroughly investigate its safety and  potential unintended adverse consequences in a variety of 
smoker subpopulations.  Indeed, the FDA’s Center for Tobacco Products seeks to establish 
research centers to assist with the mission  of investigating such regulatory matters related to 
the FSPTCA (see RFA -DA-13-003).  The FDA explicitly notes that researching tobacco 
regulatory questions in vulnerable populations is a crosscutting agency priority, listing adult 
smokers with psychiatric disorders among the vulnerable populations of interest.  
 
Potential  Benefits  of a Nicotine Reduction  Policy  for Smokers  with Mood  and Anxiety 
Disorders : 
The prevalence of smoking among people with mood and anxiety  disorders is twice that of the 
general  population (Lasser et  al., 2000).  In addition,  smokers  with mood and anxiety  disorders 
have increased markers of tobacco dependence severity (smoke more cigarettes per day, 
report  more  severe  nicotine  dependence)  than smokers  without  mental  illness  (Breslau,  Novak, 
& Kessler, 2004; Dierker, & Donny, 2008; Goodwin, Zvolensky, Keyes, & Hasin, 2012; Grant, 
Hasin, Chou, Stinson, & Dawson, 2004; Lawrence, Considine, Mitrou, & Zubrick, 2010).  
Although many smokers with mood and anxiety disorders are able to achieve abstinence with 
integrated  pharmacological  and behavioral  smoking  cessation  treatments  (e.g.,  Hall et al., 2006; 
McFall et al., 2006), these smokers infrequently access adequate smoking treatments, and 
smoking cessation rates are very low among the vast majority of smokers with mood and 
anxiety disorders who do not enter formal smoking -cessation treatments (Prochaska et al., 
2004; Hall & Prochaska, 2009; Ziedonis et al., 2008).  
 
Potential  Unintended  Consequences  of a Nicotine  Reduction  Policy  for Smokers  with 
Mood or Anxiety Disorders:  
Given that approximately 30% of smokers have mood or anxiety disorders (Goodwin et al., 
2012;  Grant  et al., 2004),  a nicotine  reduction  policy  has the potential  to dramatically  improve  
9  popula tion health.  However, it is important to determine whether a nicotine reduction strategy 
could have unintended negative consequences for these smokers.  For example, smokers with 
mood and anxiety disorders may experience more severe mood symptoms or craving  when 
smoking  very low nicotine content  cigarettes,  and may  respond  by increasing  their smoking  rate 
or puff topography characteristics in attempts to compensate for the effects of nicotine 
reduction.  One potential predictor of their response to a reductio n policy is their response to 
smoking -cessation  interventions.  Abstinence  during  smoking  treatment  has inconsistent  effects 
on mood in smokers with depression and anxiety disorders (Breslau, Kilbey, & Andreski,  
1992; Hall et al., 2006; McFall et al., 2006; Blalock et al., 2008; Smith, Homish, Giovino, & 
Kozlowski, 2014; Taylor et al., 2014; Tsoh et al., 2000; Weinberger, Desai, & McKee, 2010). 
Moreover, as treatment studies do not experimentally control abstinenc e, causality in these 
relationships cannot be determined.  Few human laboratory studies have examined whether 
nicotine  increases  depression  and anxiety  symptoms  among  smokers  with these  disorders.  The 
most relevant study in smokers with major depressive dis order (MDD) examined the effects of 
abstinence in 38 smokers with current MDD who were randomized to receiving either 21 mg 
nicotine or placebo patches for 2 weeks (Thorsteinsson et al., 2001).  Interpretation of the 
results is complicated by the fact that 14 participants (50% of those in the placebo condition, 
22% of those in the  nicotine condition)  did not complete the study  due to  resumption of  smoking. 
Among completers, nicotine withdrawal symptoms were found to be somewhat (but not 
significantly) higher  in the placebo group, and depression symptoms and negative mood ratings 
decreased (i.e., mood improved) over time across patch conditions  (Thorsteinsson et al., 2001). 
Withdrawal symptoms were higher among a subset of non -completers for whom these data  
were available than among study completers.  Thus, although nicotine abstinence did not 
exacerbate depression severity among study completers, those most affected by abstinence 
dropped out of the study.  A recent laboratory study evaluated the effects of overn ight 
abstinence and smoking re -initiation on nicotine withdrawal symptoms (Dedert et al., 2012).  
Compared to smokers  without  PTSD,  those with PTSD  displayed higher  craving  and withdrawal 
symptoms  following  overnight  abstinence.  After  re-initiating  smoking,  those  with PTSD  reported 
less relief  from craving  and negative affect  compared to smokers  without  PTSD.  In both groups, 
smoking  a nicotine cigarette after  abstinence was  associated with a greater reduction in craving 
and withdrawal s ymptoms than smoking  a denicotinized cigarette.  Thus,  results of  both studies 
indicate that brief nicotine abstinence is associated with increased mood disruption during 
smoking abstinence in smokers with MDD or PTSD.  To our knowledge, no laboratory studie s 
have evaluated the effects of extended nicotine abstinence on mood in smokers with current 
mood or anxiety disorders.  
 
Another  mechanism  that may underlie  the high prevalence  of smoking  among  people  with mood 
disorders is nicotine’s enhancement of cognitive functioning. MDD is associated with 
neurocognitive impairments, including deficits in executive functioning, attention and working 
memory (Castaneda et al., 2008).  Smoking abstinence degrades, and nicotine improves, 
cognitive perfo rmance in smokers in general (Heishman et al., 2010) by increasing the release 
of acetylcholine, dopamine, glutamate, and other neurotransmitters mediating cognition (Di 
Matteo et al., 2007; Poorthuis et al., 2009; Levin et al., 2006). Given that enhanceme nt of 
cognitive performance may help to maintain smoking in people with MDD (Malpass & Higgs,  
10  2007),  nicotine reduction could exacerbate their cognitive  dysfunction,  and smokers  with MDD 
could  increase  their smoking  rates  or smoke  inhalation  patterns  in attempts  to overcome  these 
effects.  
Cigarettes  to be assessed  in this study:  
The cigarettes  to be used  in this study  were  made  under  an NIH contract  with production  being 
overseen by the Research Triangle Institute (referred to as “Spectrum cigarettes”).  NIH 
currently has approximately 10 million of these cigarettes (of varying types) for research 
purposes.  The cigarettes selected for the study span the range of yields likely to produce the 
hypothesized effects,  as described above.  Spectrum cigarettes  are not  currently  commercially 
available, although they are similar in many ways to marketed cigarettes (e.g., similar 
manufacturing, filter, paper, etc.).  
 
Screening  Procedures 
Recruitment  
A sample size of 207 completers is proposed to  test the primary outcome.  Anticipating 25% 
attrition, and six pilot participants (3 at Brown, 3 at UVM), 282 participants will be enrolled 
across both sites (94 at Brown, 188 at UVM).  Potential participants will respond to community 
advertisements (local newspapers, community bulletin boards, lab Facebook page, Facebook 
ads, lab website, center website, behavioral health centers, Craigslist, city buses, etc.) that 
contain a study description, link to an online survey and the name and phone number of the 
Research Assistant.  Participants can choose to complete the pre -screening questionnaire 
online or by phone.  The Patient Health Questionnaire -4 (Kroenke et al., 2009) will be used to 
screen for  probable mood or  anxiety  disorder.  This 4-item instrument,  which comprises  the first 
2 items  of the Patient  Health  Questionnaire  9-item (PHQ -9) scale  (Kroenke  et al., 2001)  and the 
first 2 items of the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7 -item (GAD -7) scale (Spitzer et al., 2006), 
measures the two core DSM -IV criteria for major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety 
disorder, respectively.  The PHQ –4 begins with the stem question: “Over the last 2 weeks, how 
often have you  been  bothered  by the following  problems?” and each item is  scored from 0 (“not 
at all”), 1 (“several days”), 2 (“more than half the days”), or 3 (“nearly every day”).  Therefore, 
the total score on this composite m easure ranges from 0 to 12.  A total score of 3 for the 2 
anxiety items or the 2 depression items, plus questions querying past treatment for depression 
or anxiety, will be used to identify probable cases.  If deemed eligible, those who complete the 
online q uestionnaire will be called by the Research Assistant to further discuss the study.  The 
RA will read a script  briefly explaining the study.  Participants will be informed that this is not a 
smoking cessation program, and that smoking cessation services are available in the 
community independent of their decision to participate in this study.  If interested, they will be 
scheduled for an in -person screening  interview.  Those who call into the laboratory will be  read 
a script briefly explaining the study.  After verbal informed consent is received, the participants 
will be asked questions over the phone to determine initial eligibility.  Callers will be informed 
that this is not a smoking  cessation program,  and that  smoking  cessation services  are available 
in the c ommunity independent of their decision to participate in this study.  Eligible and 
interested participants will be scheduled for an in -person screening interview.  
11  Potential participants will be instructed to bring a pack of their usual brand c igarettes, all 
prescription  medications  they are currently  taking  and identification  (example,  driver’s  license)  to 
the screening visit. If participants anticipate not having acceptable ID, site staff should consult 
with the project coordinator or study PI.  
A participant must complete his/her in -person screening session within 30 days of completing 
the pre -screening  questionnaire.  If the participant  is not able to attend  the in-person  screening 
visit in that timeframe, he/she will need to complete t he pre -screening questionnaire again.  
 
Informed  Consent  Process:  
Before beginning the informed consent process, potential participants will need to produce 
identification as described above.  The interviewer will confirm the age and identity of the 
particip ant. If the participant is not between the ages of 18 and 70, he/she will be dismissed 
without payment.  During the in -person screening session, study information will be presented 
and written informed consent will be required prior to participating in the screening session.  In 
order to ensure adequate informed consent, participants will be asked to read the first several 
lines aloud (to determine literacy) and will then be given ample time to read the consent 
document.  If the interviewer suspects the partic ipant is not literate, he or she will have them 
continue  reading  further  to confirm.  Inability  to read and comprehend  written  study  materials  will 
result in ineligibility and the interviewer will inform the participant that they  are not eligible.  Only 
after the participant and the researcher are fully satisfied that the participant understands the 
purpose of the study, the confidentiality of the data, the procedures, the risks/benefits and 
his/her rights as a research participant will the consent form b e signed and the participant 
undergo screening procedures.  
 
Screening  Measures  
Those  who consent  will be screened  for eligibility  using  the following  measures:  
 
The following  physiological  measures  will be collected,  recorded  on paper,  and entered 
into REDCap by the interviewer at the end of the visit:  
1) Breath alcohol levels (BAL)  will be measured using an Alcosensor monitor.  Participants 
with levels  over 0.01 g/l may  reschedule  the interview  but will need  to be re-consented  to 
ensure  they have  received  adequate  informed  consent.  They  will be excluded  if they are 
positive the second time.  
2) Weight  and height  will be measured  to determine  the participant’s  Body  Mass Index. 
Weight will be measured in kilograms and height will be measured in  centimeters.  
3) Expired breath carbon monoxide (CO)  levels will be assessed using a Smokerlyzer 
ED50  CO meter  (Bedfont  Instruments),  a reliable  and valid measure  of recent  smoking.  
a. NicAlert  Strips  will be used  to asses  urinary  cotinine  levels  if a participan t's 
carbon monoxide reading is less than or equal to 8 ppm.  
4) A urine toxicological screen  will be performed to assess the presence of illicit drugs 
including marijuana, cocaine, opiates, oxycodone, benzodiazepines, barbiturates, 
amphetamines, methadone, bup renorphine, methamphetamines, MDMA and PCP. 
Participants  who fail the drug screen for  drugs  other  than marijuana may  reschedule  the 
interview but will need to be re -consented to ensure they have received adequate 
informed consent.  They will be ex cluded if they are positive for drugs other than 
marijuana the second time.  
5) Urine  Pregnancy  Test (HCG  detection)  will be performed  for all participants.  
12  6) Blood  pressure  and heart  rate will be measured  using  a CritiCare  monitor  to help the 
licensed medical professional determine final participant eligibility.  
 
The following  screening  questionnaires  will be participant -administered  via paper  and 
then will be entered into REDCap  by the interviewer at the end of the visit:  
1) Identifying Information Form  will include the participant’s REDCap Subject Identifier, 
name,  address  (including  the county  of residence),  email  address,  phone number,  age, 
date of birth, and social security numb er (if applicable).  
a. This form will be entered  into the ‘Identifying  Information  Access  Database’.  
i. Each  site will have  a separate  ‘Identifying  Information  Access  Database’.  
ii. Identifying  information  will not be shared  with other  sites.  Each  site is 
responsible for maintaining confidentiality of this information.  
iii. Identifying information will be kept in a locked file cabinet (source 
document)  and in a password  protected  Access Database  (electronic 
version) separate from all other study data.  
2) Beck  Depre ssion  Inventory  (BDI;  Beck,  Ward,  & Mendelson,  1961),  to assess 
depressive symptoms.  
3) Overall  Anxiety  Severity  and Impairment  Scale (OASIS;  Norman  et al., 2006)  to assess 
frequency and severity of anxiety symptoms.  
 
 
The following  screening  assessments  will be administered  as an interview and  then  will 
be entered into REDCap by the interviewer at the end of the visit:  
1) The Mini International  Neuropsychiatric  Interview  (MINI) suicide  subscale  (Sheehan  et 
al., 1997) to evaluate suicide risk  
2) The Mini International  Neuropsychiatric  Interview  (MINI)  PLUS  6.0 Modules  
3) MINI  Follow -up Questionnaire  (if applicable)  
4) Tobacco Use History  and Exposure Questionnaire , which measures variables  such as 
smoking  amount,  cigarette  brand,  age of initiation  of smoking,  number  of quit attempts, 
duration of quit attempts and duration of smoking  
5) Smoking  Cessation  Therapy  Use Questionnaire  
6) Time  Since  Last Cigarette  Questionnaire  
7) Medical  History  Questionnaire  to assess  current  diagnoses,  symptoms  and past health 
problems  
a. The medications  section  will be transferred  onto the ‘Concomitant  Medications’  
form and entered  into REDCap  
 
The following  screening  assessments  will be completed  by the participant  directly  in 
REDCap, except where noted:  
1) Demographic  History  Questionnaire , which  will assess  age, gender,  ethnicity,  race, 
education, income, marital status, and employment history  
2) Alcohol  Use Questionnaire  (12 month  and 1 month  version)  
3) Drug  Use Questionnaire  (12 month  and 1 month  version)  
4) Fagerström  Test for Nicotine  Dependence  (FTND;  Heatherton  et al., 1991)  
5) Wisconsin  Inventory  of Smoking  Dependence  Motives -Brief Scale  (WISDM;  Piper  et al., 
2008), will be administered to assess nicotine dependence severity  
13  6) Smoking  Stages  of Change  Algorithm  as well as a contemplation  ladder  to assess 
intention to quit smoking (DiClemente et al., 1991).  
7) The Mini International  Neuropsychiatric  Interview  (MINI  6.0) (Sheehan  et al., 1990) a 
structured diagnostic interview to eva luate psychiatric disorders  
a. Will be completed  by participant  through  the In-Home  Screening  system 
supported by Medical Outcomes Systems  
 
In the event that the REDCap  website is not functioning, the assessments will be printed out 
and administered  on paper.  The source documents will be kept  in the  participant’s  binder.  The 
interviewer will enter the data into REDCap when it resumes functioning properly.  This 
informatio n should  be recorded  in the ‘End of Visit Evaluation  Form’  and filed in the participant’s 
binder.  
Suicidality/Mental  Health  Monitoring  
Participants  who endorse suicidal intention in the past  month  or a suicide attempt  in the  past 6 
months as indicated on the BDI (score > 1 on question 9) or MINI suicide subscale (endorse 
question 4 and/or 5 on the MINI suicide subscale or question 6 on the MINI suicide subscale 
with suicide attempt in the past 6 months) or answer “yes” to question A3g on the M INI 
Neuropsychiatric interview and symptoms have occurred in the past two weeks, will not be 
eligible to participate in the study.  The research staff member will contact a licensed on -site 
clinician for evaluation.  In the  event  that no clinician  is availab le, staff will put  the participant  in 
contact  with the National  Suicide  Prevention  Lifeline  at 1-800-273-8255.  They  will also contact 
the Study Coordinator and Site PI to inform them of the situation as soon as possible.  
Additionally, they will contact the  Project Coordinator to inform her of the situation.  The 
participant will be paid $25  (+$25  bonus if applicable) and provided with local mental  health 
resources.  Post enrollment,  any report  of suicidal  ideation  or attempt  by a participant  will be 
grounds for immediate withdrawal from the study.

19) Participation  in another  research  study  in the past 30 days.  
20) Co- habitation  with any former  research  participant  who was provided  with Spectrum 
research cigarettes to smoke outside the lab.  
 
Children under age 18 are excluded because they cannot legally buy cigarettes.  Those with 
unstable medical, psychiatric, or medication conditions (as determined by the licensed medical 
professional)  are exclud ed as  these symptoms  could affect  a participant’s  ability  to complete the 
study.  Examples include but are not limited to the following: angina, stroke, heart attack which 
occurred since phone screening, blood clots in the arms or legs for which the individ ual is 
undergoing  active  medical  treatment,  cancer  requiring  active  chemotherapy  or radiation  therapy,  
15  severe shortness of breath caused by conditions such as uncontrolled asthma, COPD, or 
arrhythmia, active untreated infection such as pneumo nia, active untreated endocrine disorder 
such as  hyperthyroidism.  We will  exclude those currently  seeking  smoking  treatment and those 
who plan to quit in the next 30 days, as participation in this study may not lead to reductions in 
smoking.  We will exclude  pregnant  or nursing  women and  women  of reproductive  potential  who 
are unwilling  to use  acceptable forms  of birth control  throughout  the study.  We will  also exclude 
anyone with current or recent alcohol or drug abuse problems as these factors could 
independently affect smoking behavior during the study.  Individuals with baseline CO readings 
greater than 80 ppm, those with heart rate or blood pressure readings that are out of range 
(systolic: 90 -159 mmHg; diastolic: 50 -99 mmHg; HR: 45 -114 bpm) and any one who has 
attempted suicide in the past six months will be excluded from the study for safety concerns.  
Individuals who smoke ‘roll your own’ cigarettes exclusively will be excluded from the study 
because  we will be unable  to standardize  their baseline  smoking  behavior. Individuals  who have 
recently participated in a research study will be excluded as participation may have changed 
their smoking behavior, which may preclude a stable smoking baseline.  Because participants 
are required to complete portions of the protocol independently, they will need to be able to 
independently read and comprehend the study materials.  
 
Eligibility  Determination:  
The research assistant will review the entire screening assessment battery for initial eligibility 
determination,  confirming the subject meets the above described inclusion/exclusion criteria. 
The final eligibility of the participant will be determined by  a licensed medical professional (MD, 
DO, NP, PA, Master’s prepared RN or CRN) at each site after reviewing the Medical History 
Questionnaire, BDI, Mini Neuropsychiatric Interview, and the MINI suicide subscale.  The 
licensed medical professional may meet wi th a participant if available and think it necessary for 
eligibility determination.  He/she will sign off on eligibility prior to the first baseline visit.  If the 
licensed  medical  professional  determines  the participant  is not medically  eligible  to particip ate in 
the study, has current symptomatology that would interfere with interpretation of the data or is 
unlikely to complete the study he/she will inform the research assistants who will contact the 
participant prior to the first baseline visit.  The licens ed medical professional will not need to 
review the medical history forms of participants who are not eligible for other, non -medical 
reasons.  
If a participant  fails the urine  toxicology  screen  due to a prescription  medication he/she  is taking, 
then he/she  will not be automatically excluded.  The interviewer will make note of this when 
he/she submits the forms to the licensed medical professional for final eligibility determination.  
Once all the screening procedures have been completed, researchers will pay participants $25 
(+$25 bonus if applicable) for their time as long as they pass the drug and breath alcohol tests 
and meet  the minimum  requirements  for carbon  monoxide  or NicAlert  levels.  Those  participants 
who do not pass these tests or meet these requirements will be dismissed from the study 
without payment.  Marijuana will be tested for but will not be an exclusionary criterion.  If a 
participant does not pass the drug test but has a current, valid prescription that would explain 
the failed test he/ she will not  be automatically excluded and will still receive the visit payment.  
Participants  who meet  all other  eligibility  criteria,  sans  the medical  criteria,  will be scheduled  for 
the first baseline visit.  
16  At the end of the screening session, the researcher will complete the End of Visit Evaluation 
Form, which will be filed in the subject’s binder.  This will allow the researcher to make note of 
any problems  encountered  during  the visit, to track  which  computers  were  used  for which  tasks, 
and to assess the truthfulness of the participant in regards to self -report of tobacco use.  
 
Baseline  Procedures  
This study will use a one -week, two -session baseline period to collect baseline individual 
difference measures and monitor dai ly usual -brand smoking behavior.  At Baseline 1, 
participants will be provided their usual brand cigarettes to smoke, equivalent to 150% of their 
daily smoking  rate. A time line follow  back  (TLFB)  will be used  to assess  the daily cigarette  use 
for the  past 7 days.  Participants will be provided their usual brand cigarettes for the first seven 
days of the baseline period.  If the baseline period extends past seven days, participants will 
need to purchase their own usual brand cigarettes.  Use of a two session ba seline period will 
ensure stability of daily smoking reports, reduce reactivity to the daily cigarette monitoring, and 
reduce participant burden.  During the two baseline sessions, participants will complete 
subjective questionnaires, assessments of cogniti ve functioning, and smoking topography.  
Each visit will last approximately two to four hours.  At the end of each baseline session, the 
researcher  will complete  the End of Visit Evaluation  Form,  which  will be filed in the participants’ 
binder.  This will allow the researcher to make note of any problems encountered during the 
visit, to track  which computers  were used for which tasks,  and to assess  the truthfulness  of the 
participant in regards to self -report of tobacco use.  
Visit scheduling  requirements  for baseline  period:  
Participants will be required to schedule the Baseline 1 visit within 30 days of their screening 
visit. If a participant still wants to be in the study after 30 days, he/she will need to be re - 
screened.  The participant will need to be r e-consented but will maintain the original REDCap 
Subject  Identifier.  The ideal  target  window  separating  Baseline 1 and Baseline 2 is  between 7 
and 12  days.  The minimum  is 7 days  and the maximum  is 21 days.  If the participant  does  not 
complete the visit within  21 days,  then he/she will  not be rescheduled and will  be discontinued 
from the study.  
Measures/Assessments  
Physiological  measures  collected  at Baseline  1, recorded  on paper,  and entered  into 
REDCap by the interviewer at the end of the visit:  
1) BAL 
2) Weight  
3) CO 
4) Blood  Pressure  
5) Heart  Rate 
6) Urine Toxicology  
The following  questionnaires  will be participant -administered  via paper  at Baseline  1 and 
then will be entered into REDCap  by the interviewer at the end of the visit:  
1) BDI 
2) OASIS  
17  The following  assessments  will be administered  as an interview at  Baseline  1 and then 
entered into REDCap by the interviewer at the end of the visit:  
1) Concomitant  Medications  Form  
2) Health  Changes  Questionnaire,  which  will assess  any weekly  health changes,  
3) Time  Since  Last Cigarette  Questionnaire  
 
The following  assessments  will be administered  at Baseline  1 and completed  by the 
participant directly in REDCap:  
 
1) Perceived  Health  Risks  Rating  (Hatsukami  et al., 2010),  a measure  of the perceived 
addictive potential and other health risks associated with cigarettes  
2) Respiratory  Health  Questionnaire , a measure  of cough,  shortness  of breath  and other 
respiratory symptoms  
3) Minnesota  Nicotine  Withdrawal  Scale  (MNWS;  Hughes  & Hatsukami,  1986),  a measure 
of nicotine withdrawal  
4) Questionnaire  of Smoking  Urges -brief scale - Usual  Cigarette  (QSU;  Cox, Tiffany,  & 
Christen, 2001; Tiffany & Drobes, 1991), which measures the urge to smoke  
5) Cigarette  Evaluation  Scale  – Usual  Cigarette (CES;  Westman,  Levin,  & Rose,  1992), 
which measures responses to cigarettes (e.g., reward, satisfaction).  
6) Intolerance for Discomfort Questionnaire - (IDQ; Sirota et al., 2013), assesses 
intolerance  for the discomfort  of smoking  abstinence.  The measure  includes  three 
subscales: physical discomfort, emotional discomfort and smoking withdrawal 
discomfort.  
7) Cigarette Purchase Task – Usual Brand Version (CPT; MacKillop et al., 2008), a self - 
report analogue of a progressive -ratio schedule that measures the relative reinforcing 
efficacy of cigarettes by querying  how many  of that  day’s cigarette they would consume 
in a day at varying  prices.  This task will indicate  whether  prolonged  VLNC cigarette  use 
reduces cigarette demand and increases sensitivity to increases in cigarette costs.  
8) Perceived  Stress  Scale - 4 item (PSS -4; Cohen,  Kamarck,  & Mermelstein,  1983),  which 
measures the degree to which life situations are appraised as stressful.  
9) Positive  and Negative  Affect  Schedule  (PANAS;  Watson,  Clark,  & Tellegan,  1988), 
which measures symptoms of positive and negative affect.  
 
Physiological  measures  collected  at Baseline  2, recorded  on paper  and entered  into 
REDCap by the interviewer at the end of the visi t: 
1) BAL 
2) Weight  
3) CO 
4) Blood  Pressure  
5) Heart  Rate 
6) Urine  Toxicology  
7) Urine  Pregnancy  
18  The following  assessments  will be administered  as an interview  at Baseline  2 and then 
entered into REDCap  by the interviewer at the end of the visit:  
1) Concomitant  Medications  Form  
2) Health  Changes  Questionnaire  
3) Time  Since  Last Cigarette  Questionnaire  
 
The following assessments will be administered at Baseline 2 and completed by the 
participant  on paper  and enter ed into REDCap  by the interviewer  at the end of the visit:  
1) BDI 
2) OASIS  
 
The following  assessments  will be administered  at Baseline  2 and completed  by the 
participant directly in REDCap:  
1) FTND  
2) WISDM  
 
In the event that the REDCap  website is not functioning, the assessments will be printed out 
and administered  on paper.  The source documents  will be kept  in the  participant’s  binder.  The 
interviewer will enter the data into REDCap when it resumes functioning properly.  This 
information  should  be recorded  in the ‘End of Visit Evaluation  Form’  and filed in the participant’s 
binder.  
Cognitive  Tasks  (Baseline  2 Only):  
Cognitive  functioning  will be assessed  using  a battery  of computer -based  assessments.  We will 
assess domains tha t are theoretically linked to smoking and likely to be sensitive to nicotine 
abstinence (Heishman, 1999; Kleykamp et al., 2005; Rycroft et al., 2006).  Prior to test 
administration, participants will be trained to ensure their understanding of each test.  Tests will 
be administered on a desktop computer.  
1) N-Back (0,2) Task (Ernst et al., 2001): A measure of working memory in which 
participants  view serially  presented  letters  on a computer.  They  must  indicate  whether 
each letter presented is the same  or different from the letter presented a specified 
number of positions back in the string of letters (e.g. 2 -back).  
2) 2-Letter Search (Ernst et al., 2001): A measure of focused attention in which 
participants  view strings  of letters  on a computer  screen  looking for whether each  string 
contains or does not contain two target letters.  
3) Continuous Performance Test (CPT; Myers et. Al., 2008): A measure of sustained 
attention, participants must monitor a string of stimuli (e.g. letters) serially presented on  
a computer  screen  monitoring  for presentation  of a target  stimulus.  The task is balanced 
so that  they either must  respond,  or inhibit  a response each time the target  is presented.  
4) Stop  Signal  Task  (SST;  Logan  et al., 1984):  A computer  administered test  of behavioral 
inhibition.  Participants make frequent motor responses (e.g., left/right responses 
indicating if a visually presented arrow points left or right) and occasional, unpredictable 
response inhibitions (e.g., when a second arrow, pointing upwards, is  presented).  The 
stop signal delay (the interval between the onset of the go signal and stop signal) is  
19  adjusted  after each  stop trial according  to the participants’  performance  to achieve  50 
percent  inhibition  success  rate. 
5) Nicotine Stroop Task (Stroop, 1935): Frequently used measure of inhibitory control 
functioning. It measures the ability to focus attention on relevant stimuli while ignoring 
distracters and to suppress a prepotent response (i.e., word reading) in favor of an 
atypical one (i.e., color naming).  Participants will be shown a number of images.  The 
images will either be nicotine related, evocative, or neutral in nature with different color 
borders (red, blue, green yellow).  The participants will be asked to use r esponse 
triggers  to identify  the color  of the  border  for each  picture  as they appear  on the screen.  
 
Smoking  Topography  (Baseline 2  Only):  
Puff Topography, a precise measure of smoking behavior (Brauer et al., 1996; Herning et al., 
1981; Robinson & Forbes,  1975), will be used to examine whether prolonged use of the 
experimental  cigarettes  affects  topography  measures  that may indicate  smoking  compensation 
(Strasser et al., 2007).  Puff topography will be assessed using a CReSS  pocket device that 
provides  a valid measurement  of puff number,  puff volume,  inter-puff interval and  other indices 
(Blank et al., 2009).  Carbon monoxide readings will be collected before and 15 minutes after 
puff topography.  Participants will smoke one ci garette of their usual brand.  
 
Interactive  Voice  Response  System:  
At the end of the first baseline visit, participants will be trained to use the Interactive Voice 
Response (IVR) System,  which will  contact  participants  each day  throughout  the study  and ask 
about their smoking behavior as well as withdrawal symptoms the week before and after 
Baseline  2. We will also review  the IVR adherence  incentive  program,  which  consists  of $1  per 
call plus a $10 bonus for seven consecutive calls.  Participants will be provided a study cell 
phone if they have unreliable telephone access, do not have enough monthly cell phone 
minutes or prefer not to use their own phone.  
 
The IVR system  is operated  by TeleSage.  To be  enrolled  in the IVR system,  resear ch staff will 
enter the participants initials, telephone number, subject identifier, and visit dates into the IVR 
TCORS website.  Identifying information (initials and telephone numbers) will not be extracted 
with the data by the bioinformatics group.  Pleas e refer to TeleSage’s privacy statement and 
HIPAA compliance form for additional information.  
 
Baseline  2 biological  specimens:  
1) Urine  sample  for smoking  biomarker  assessment : 
Participants will be asked to bring a urine sample (first void of the day) to the second 
baseline session for biomarker assessment.  Samples will be stored at temperatures no 
more than -80°C. The tobacco -specific carcinogen biomarkers are total NNAL and PAH . 
Anatabine and anabasine will be tested in the VLNC condition to validate abstinence or 
measure  the extent  of nicotine  replacement  therapy  being  used.  Total  cotinine  levels  will 
also be assessed to measure daily nicotine exposure.  Participant’s will be re minded  
with a phone call the day before the visit, those who forget will be asked to provide an 
onsite urine sample.  
2) Pulmonary  Marker:  
Fractional Exhaled Nitric Oxide (FeNO) will be assessed as  a measure  of lung  function 
using  the NIOX  VERO,  a hand -held device  for exhaled  NO analysis.  FeNO  involves  no 
storing or shipping of specimens, rather, the participant will exhale slowly through the 
device to obtain the result, which will be recorded in the participant’s source.  
20  3) Cardiovascula r Markers:  
Blood samples will be used for measurement of a battery of cardiovascular biomarkers 
primarily focusing on three areas: glucose tolerance (fasting insulin, glucose,  
hemoglobin A1C), clotting markers (thrombin, fibrinogen, PAI -1), inflammatory ma rkers 
(C-reactive protein, interleukin -6, D-Dimer). Secondary measures include: Fasting lipid 
profile (total cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL -C, LDL -C). Participants will be required to 
fast for a minimum  of 8 hours.  Ideally,  participants  will not eat or drink after midnight  and 
blood draws will be  done in the morning. After the blood draw, participants will be 
provided with a meal voucher so that they may eat  before performing the remaining visit 
tasks.  The following volumes and tubes will be collected: Two 5 mL SST tubes, one 10 
mL EDTA tube and two 2.7 mL citrate tubes . 
4) Additional  Blood  Samples : 
Blood samples will also be used for assessing individual differences in nicotine 
metabolism  by phenotyping  (i.e., Nicotine  Metabolic  Ratio,  NMR,  which  is phenotypically 
estimated  as the ratio  of 3-hydroxyc otinine [3 HC]  to cotinine [COT] in plasma).  One 10 
mL EDTA tube will be collected.  
 
We will store  blood  for the  purposes  of analyzing  additional  cardiovascular  biomarkers  or 
genotyping of individual differences in nicotine metabolism (CYP2A6) an alyses of 
nicotine metabolism (variation in CYP2A6) or nicotinic acetylcholine receptor gene 
subtypes. All samples will be stored at the University of Vermont Tracy Lab.  
 
Biomarker  shipping  and storage:  
Biomarkers will be shipped quarterly to the Universit y of Vermont Laboratory for Clinical 
Biochemistry Research (Tracy Lab).  The Tracy Lab will serve as a central repository for all 
biomarker  specimens  and will be responsible  for distributing  specimens  to the appropriate  labs 
on a quarterly  basis.  Urine  samples  will be analyzed  and stored  at the University  of Minnesota 
Hecht Lab.  Cardiovascular Biomarkers will be analyzed and stored at the Tracey Lab.  
Additional  blood  samples  for the purposes  of phenotyping  will be analyzed  and stored  at the 
University of Toronto Tyndale Lab.  
 
Baseline  fMRI  testing  (University  of Vermont  only):  
Participants at the UVM site will complete the neuroimaging battery two or three days  after the 
first baseline  assessment,  depending  on availability.  This battery  will be completed  only among 
a randomly selected subset of participants in the lowest and the highest dose conditions (45 
participants/dose condition for  total of 90 participants),  which will  provide the greatest  likelihood 
of detecting differences  between nicotine doses.  Forty -five participants from each of the two 
conditions will be selected with the goal of having 20 completers from each of the doses.  
Participants who consent to neuroimaging and  meet the eligibility criteria will be  encouraged to  
abstain from smoking for  approximately 24 hours before their scan.  Abstinence will  be verified 
by expired breath carbon monoxide levels that have decreased by at least 50% from the 
measure  taken  during  the Baseline  1 visit. The battery  includes  fMRI  assessments  that parallel 
the behavioral/cognitive assessments described above (i.e., a sustained attention task, 
inhibitory control test of executive function) and that are sensitive to abstinence -related 
disruptions in performance.  
 
Prior to Baseline sca n, participants will partake in a practice session of the fMRI cognitive 
battery  tasks  in a mock  scanner  at the Clinical  Research  Center  (CRC)  in order  to practice  each 
task in an environment that closely mimics that of the actual fMRI machine itself.  
21  The neuroimaging  battery  also includes  a high-resolution anatomical  scan to assess  total and 
regional  grey matter  volumes  and cortical  thickness,  a resting - state scan to assess  intra- and 
inter-regional  brain  connectivity,  and arteri al spin labeling  to provide  a quantitative  measure  of 
blood flow.  Baseline characterization and comparison with a second scan approximately 12 
weeks later will provide the potential for insights into the neurobiology of dependence and 
withdrawal (including individual differences in dependence severity) and differential changes 
that may arise from being exposed for an extended period to VLNC versus usual nicotine 
content levels in commercially available cigarettes.  
 
Experimental  Procedures 
Experime ntal Period:  
Participants will be seen weekly throughout the 12 -week experimental period.  Weeks 2, 6, 12 
and the abstinence visit will take approximately 2 -4 hours each.  All other sessions will last 
approximately  2 hours.  Upon  arrival  at the laboratory,  participants  will provide urine and breath 
BAL and CO samples.  If the participant has a positive urine toxicology screen the Research 
Assistant  will initiate  the Field  Sobriety  SOP  to determine  if the participant  can continue  with the 
session or if it should  be rescheduled. At the end of  each experimental session, the  researcher 
will complete the End of Visit Evaluation Form, which will be filed in the participant’s binder.  
This will allow  the researcher  to make  note of any problems  encountered  during  the visit, to 
track which computers were used for which tasks, and to assess the truthfulness of the 
participant in regards to self -report of tobacco use and compliance to study procedures.  
 
Visit  scheduling  requirements  for experimental  period:  
The ideal sche duling window between each visit is 7 days based on the date of the Baseline 2 
Visit.  For additional scheduling requirements, refer to the ‘ Scheduling Visits SOP ’. If a 
participant misses a visit and is not able to reschedule during the window (± 3 days), that visit 
will not be ‘made -up’ in the future.  All measures that  were not completed will be considered 
missing  data and will not  be collected during  future visits.  If a visit  mistakenly  occurs outside  of 
the designated  window,  this is a protocol deviation.  A ‘Non -Medical  Event  Form’  will need  to be 
completed.  Additionally, each visit should occur at approximately the same time of day ± 2 
hours.  
If a participant  is not able to attend  his/her  Week  12 visit, then it  should be rescheduled even if  it 
is outside of the scheduling window.  This will be documented as a protocol deviation.

In the event that the REDCap  website is not functioning, the assessments will be printed out 
and administered  on paper.  The source documents will be kept  in the  participant’s  binder.  The 
interviewer will enter the data into REDCap when it resumes functioning properly.  This 
informatio n should  be recorded  in the ‘End of Visit Evaluation  Form’  and filed  in the participant’s 
binder.  
Participants  will also complete  the following  tasks:  
 
1) Cognitive  tasks (weeks  2, 6 and 12 only)  
2) Smoking  Topography  - study  cigarette (weeks  2, 6 and 12 only)  
 
Week  12 fMRI  testing  (University  of Vermont  only):  
 
Participants at the UVM site will also complete the neuroimaging battery again to assess 
changes after extended exposure to different doses.  Participants who have initiated a quit 
attempt will not be asked to smoke prior to the scan.  Participants willing to smoke the research 
cigarettes  will take two puffs  30 minutes  prior to the scan.  If the participant  is unwilling  to smoke 
the research cigarette, they will be allowed to smoke their usual brand.  
 
Biological  Samples  to be collected:  
1) First void urine sample  (Weeks  6 and 12 only)  
2) Blood Samples  (Weeks  6 and 12 only) 
3) Collect  FeNO  (Weeks  6 and 12 only)  
24  Interactive  Voice  Response  System:  
Participants will continue to use the IVR system on a daily basis throughout the experimental 
period to record the number of study cigarettes smoked per day and use of non -study 
cigarettes.  During  the first  week  after Bas eline  2, the IVR  system  will collect  information  about 
withdrawal symptoms.  
Variable  Incentive  Program:  
An incentive  program  has been  developed  with the goal of improving  attendance  at scheduled 
assessment sessions, compliance with using only study -provide d tobacco products, and 
encouraging honest self -reports regarding all nicotine/tobacco use.  
 
Briefly, participants will receive a total of five tickets for each weekly visit they attend after 
randomization (Visits 03 -14, weeks 1 -12). In total, participants  could earn 60 valid tickets  
across the 12 visits.  Participants will be instructed that these tickets correspond to attendance 
(one ticket), honest reporting (one ticket), and adherence to using only the assigned study 
product (three tickets).  They will be further instructed that these tickets “could” be eligible for 
entry  into a monthly  drawing  for prizes,  but that only tickets  that are “validated”  will be eligible for 
prizes.  
 
Since it is prohibitively expensive to test urine samples each week for each participant and 
because  it is currently  not feasible  to detect  with reasonable  precision  non-compliance  based  on 
biomarkers in the two higher nicotine group, we plan to only valid ate the attendance tickets.  
Hence,  each  participant  who attends  their regularly  scheduled  weekly  session  will have  a total 
of five validated tickets entered into the monthly drawing.  
 
To convey the message that we may be validating honest reporting and use of only study - 
provided products, we will collect a weekly urine specimen from participants.  Further, in a 
bogus pipeline of sorts, participants will be instructed and that these urine specimens MAY be 
used to biochemically verify complia nce to the study product by testing different nicotine and 
tobacco products found in the urine.  Likewise, participants will also be instructed that their 
honesty  ticket  MAY  be validated  if their self-reported  tobacco  use matches  what’s  in their urine. 
So there is some minor deception involved, but technically we could conduct urine toxicology 
testing  for both purposes.  Hence,  if the urine toxicology testing  is presented  as something  that 
MAY be done for validation purposes, we feel that any deception is rel atively minor.  For 
scientific/economic reasons we are just electing to restrict validation to attendance.  
Nevertheless, we will debrief all participants upon the completion of the trial.  We will inform 
them  that the incentive  program  was based  exclusively  on attendance  due to the relatively  high 
cost of urine toxicology  testing  and other  practical  problems  with shipping  the urines  for prompt 
testing.  
 
Drawings will  be conducted on the 1st of each month.  Validation will  be performed by staff who 
have  no participant  interaction  and are not blind  to condition.  Any ticket  drawn  will be eligible  for 
an incentive as the only true contingency is for attendance.  There will be no mention of the 
basis for earning incentives (i.e., whether the ticket was fo r attendance, honesty, adherence,).  
Participants  will simply  be informed  that he or she earned  an incentive  from the drawing.  
 
Each  drawing  will be independent  (without  replacement);  consequently,  some  participants  will 
not win a prize and others may win more than one during the study if more than one of their 
tickets is drawn. After confirming winners, the remaining tickets from each month will be 
discarded (i.e.,  tickets  will only  be entered into  one drawing).  The monthly  prize  amounts  are 
25  detailed  below.  
 
We estimate based on the 2½ years we estimate it will take to complete this study, that 
participants  will win an average  of approximately  $65 in prizes  or an additional  $5.50  per week 
per participant.  
 
Grand Prize (1): $500 cash 
Second  Prize  (1): $200  cash 
Third Prize (5): $10 cash  
Product  and Procedures  Compliance  Review  Sessions:  
At each visit,  Baseline  2 through  Week  11, participants  will be counseled  about  their use of the 
study cigarettes.  Participants will be asked about any concerns or obstacles associated with 
use of the study cigarettes.  The importance of honest self -reporting will be stressed.  
Participants will be told that they will not be penalized for use of other nicotine or tobacco 
products and that it  is crucial for them to report any use of these products.  If difficulties are 
encountered, participants will be asked why they think they are experiencing difficulties (e.g., 
taste, withdrawal symptoms) and to problem -solve how to deal with these difficult ies in order to 
meet the protocol requirements.  Additionally, participants will be counseled about their IVR 
completion,  visit attendance,  task engagement  and product  accountability.  Refer to the ‘ Product 
and Procedures Compliance Review Sessions SOP ’ for more information.  
Quit Attempts  During  the Study  Protocol:  
At each weekly session, we will ask the participant if he/she is currently abstaining from 
smoking  with the intention of  quitting.  If the answer  is no, then we will  also ask  if he/she is 
planning t o quit smoking prior to his/her next scheduled visit.  
If a Participant  is Currently  Abstaining  from  Smoking  with the Intention  to Quit:  
 
• Encourage  participant  to continue  abstaining  from smoking  
• Schedule  the participant  for normal  weekly  visits,  but no puff topography  
• Provide  the participant  with the ‘Clearing  the Air’ manual  and local smoking  cessation  
resources  
• Give the participant  the option  to take home  study  product  rather  than require him/her  to 
take the product  
• If the participant choses to take home the study product have him/her sign a form 
acknowledging that cigarette availability could be detrimental to the quit attempt. 
Recommend  that he/she  put the product  “away”  at home  as to avoid  unwanted  cues  to 
smoke.  
• If the participant  chooses  not to take home  the study  product,  have him/her  contact  the 
lab if he/she lapses and would like to pick up or be mailed the study product prior to 
his/her next visit.  
If a Participant  is Planning  to Quit Smoking,  but has not initiated  the quit  attempt:  
 
• Ask if he/she has  identified  a target  quit date and, if so, what  that target  date is. 
• Provide  the participant  with the ‘Clearing  the Air’ manual  and local smoking  cessation  
resources.  
• Provide  the participant  with the study  product  as usual.  Recommend  that on the target 
date he/she put the product “away” at home as to avoid unwanted cues to smoke.  
26  Abstinence  Assessment  Session:  
After the week 12 visit, participants will be required to come back for one additional visit the  
following  day. During  this visit, participants will have  been encouraged to  abstain from smoking 
until their next scheduled visit (approximately 24 hours later).  The abstinence assessment 
session should be scheduled no less than 18 hours  and no more than 30 hours after the Week 
12 visit.  Abstinence will be verified by expired breath carbon monoxide levels that have 
decreased to < 4 ppm.  This session will allow us to determine whether the experimental 
cigarettes have reduced the effects of abstinence o n these measures relative to the control 
conditions.  If the participant  does  NOT  meet  abstinence criteria, he/she will  only receive  $20 for 
the visit.

interviewer will enter the data into REDCap when it resumes functioning properly.  This 
27  information  should  be recorded  in the ‘End of Visit Evaluation  Form’  and filed in the subject’s  
binder.  
 
Participants  will also complete  the following  task:  
 
1) Cognitive  tasks  
2) University of Vermont only: Participants at the UVM site will also complete the 
neuroimaging  battery  again  to assess  changes  after extended  exposure  to different 
doses.  
 
Participants  who do NOT  meet  abstinence  criteria  will be required  to complete  the 
following assessments:  
1) BAL 
2) CO 
3) Blood  Pressure  
4) Heart  Rate 
5) Urine  Toxicology  
6) Concomitant  Medications

Participant  Compensation:  
Participants will receive $25 for completing the screening visit, plus an additional $25 bonus for 
completing the visit on time as scheduled.  Payment will be made regardless of enrollment as 
long as the participant passes the drug test, breath alcohol test, and meets the minimum 
requirements for carbon monoxide or NicAlert levels.  Participants who do not pass these tests 
will be dismissed  from the screening  visit without  payment, except  in the event  they can produce 
a prescription for the medication that caused them to fail the drug test.  Participants will receive  
$100 for each of the shorter sessions (Baseline 1, Weeks 1, 2,  3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11),  $150 for 
each of the longer sessions (Baseline 2, Weeks 6 &12), up to $160 for the abstinence visit 
($150 for the visit + up to $10 for the preference test), $20 for biochemical verification of 
abstinence,  up to $221  for completi ng daily IVR reports  of study  cigarette  and other  nicotine  and 
tobacco use.  Participants will also have a chance to earn an additional $50 bonus for every 
three visits that are completed on time as scheduled.  There will also be a $100 bonus for 
completing the study for a total bonus of $325.  If the participant does not  attend the screening 
visit or one of the weekly visits as scheduled, they will forfeit the bonus.  They will have a 
chance to  earn another  bonus  payment  with the  next set of three visits.  Participants  who do not 
complete the entire study will receive compensation for the sessions that they do complete.  
UVM participants who undergo fMRI testing will receive an additional $150/scan.  Total 
compensation for completing Study 2, including study visit  payments, daily IVR calls and 
bonuses is $2301 (or $2601 if  participating in the fMRI testing). Participants will also have a 
chance  to earn additional  money  through  the Variable  Incentive  program.  As mentioned  above, 
participants will have a chance to earn additional incentives each month for compliance, 
honesty and attendance, however, we anticipate that on average, participants will win 
approximately $150 in prizes.  
28  End of Study:  
After  a particip ant has completed  all study  procedures  and has been  paid for participation  the 
research assistant will read the following script and give the participant the Clearing the Air 
Manual.  
“If you’ve reduced your smoking during this study, we encourage you to co ntinue these 
reductions  or even  consider  quitting.  We would  like to provide  you with some  resources  should 
you decide to try to abstain from smoking (give “Clearing the Air” and hotline  
information).  Please also feel free to consult with your physician and use any medications 
he/she deems appropriate.  We will call you in approximately 30 days to ask about your 
smoking since leaving the study.  There is  no right  answer and we know how difficult  quitting 
can be.  Please just  answer  honestly.  The ca ll will take less  than 5 minutes.  Thanks  again for 
your participation.”  
The following  assessments will  be administered  using  REDCap:  
 
1) End of Study  Questionnaire  
 
30 Day Follow  up Phone  Call: 
Participants will receive a follow -up phone call between 25 and 35 days after the abstinence 
assessment session to assess their smoking patterns.  The phone questionnaire will last less 
than five minutes.  The questionnaire will ask if the participant is still smoking, how much and 
whether he/she has attempted to qui t smoking since the end of the study.  Participants will 
receive 5 variable incentive program lottery tickets for completing the call as compensation. 
Those who report abstinence will be invited to come in for biochemical verification and be 
compensated $40  for doing so.  A urine sample will be collected to test urine cotinine levels. 
Additionally,  any Medical  Event  Forms  that remain  open  from the last session  will be discussed. 
If the participant became pregnant during the study, this would have been recorde d as a 
medical event.  During this phone call, the research assistant will confirm her due date.  This 
event will remain  open  until delivery.  At that time the licensed medical professional will contact 
the participant  to ask a few questions  about  the baby’s  health  and will update  the Medical  Event 
Form.  
 
Once  a participant  has completed  all study  procedures  and all open  events  have  been  closed, 
the PI will review the participant’s binder and sign a form indicating study completion for that 
participant.  
 
Randomization  
At the end  of the Baseline 1 session,  participants will be randomized into one of three cigarette 
conditions.  Participants in each condition will be assigned cigarettes that match their menthol 
preference. Participants will be randomized, using block randomization, in equal  number to the 
dose conditions, with randomization stratified by study site and menthol status. Each site will 
randomize participants until the total goal of 282 participants across both sites is reached, and 
no effort  will be made to recruit  a specific  number  of menthol  and non -menthol  smokers  at each 
site.

The lead statistician  will create  a randomization  schedule  for each  of the two sites,  amounting  to 
150% of expected enrollment at each site.  The excess randomization codes will be used in the 
event that a site will have to enroll extra participants due to unexpectedly slow enrollment  at 
another site.  The nicotine doses will be identified  by letter code and the  number 2 (V2,  W2, X2, 
Y2) and only Adm inistrative Core personnel with no participant contact will have the link 
between the statistician’s  letter code and dose assignments.  The randomization schedules  and 
the link between the alphabetic code and treatment assignment will be maintained securely by 
the Administrative Core.  A second, sealed, copy will be secured in a separate building to 
protect against loss related to fire or other unforeseen events.  
The University of Vermont will be responsible for removing all identifying information fr om 
cigarettes  received  from the Research  Triangle  Institute  (RTI),  labeling  each  carton  with a blind 
code, assigning product using this blind code based on the randomization schedule being 
provided  by the UVM Biostatistics Core, and shipping  cigarettes to each site  as needed based 
on recruitment.  Each site will be responsible for tracking product received and distributed to 
participants, collecting unused product from participants, and returning unused cigarettes to  
30  UVM.  The participants,  investigators  and study  staff will not have  knowledge  of which  product  is 
given to a participant or whether different participants received the same or different product.  
During the experimental period, participants will be provided with a 14 -day supply of res earch 
cigarettes equivalent to 150% of their daily smoking rate.  This rate will be calculated at 
Baseline 2 and will be an average daily smoking rate based on the IVR data for the first seven 
days  of the baseline  period.  This will ensure  adequate  availability  of cigarettes  in the numerous 
locations participants may typically keep a supply (home, work, vehicle, etc.) as well as avoid 
expending  the entire supply if  they miss a scheduled  visit. Participants will be instructed to use 
the research cigar ettes for 12 weeks, at which point they are to discontinue product use.  
If there  is prior knowledge  a participant  will be missing  a visit  (i.e. planned  vacation,  laboratory 
closure, etc.), then the participant will be provided with an adequate supply of ci garettes to 
make up for the missed visit(s).  The participant will be given a 21 -day supply if one visit is 
going to be missed and a 28 -day supply if two visits are going to be missed.  
Participants will be asked to refrain from use of other non -study cigare ttes during the study 
period. If participants have to use another nicotine product, they will be told to use a non - 
combustible product (gum, patch, etc.).  Additionally, they will be told there is not a penalty for 
use of non -study cigarettes, and that it is crucial for them to report any use of non -study 
cigarettes or other nicotine or tobacco products.  Throughout the baseline and experimental 
periods, an Interactive Voice Response (IVR) system will be used on a daily basis to record the 
number  of study  cigarettes  and non -study  cigarettes  used the previous  day. During  the baseline 
and first experimental week, participants will also answer daily IVR questions  about their mood. 
Participants will be seen weekly for assessments.  Brief standardized revie w sessions focusing 
on compliance with the study cigarettes and other study procedures will be provided at each 
visit. At the end of the 12 -week trial, participants will undergo an assessment of withdrawal, 
craving, and cognitive function following a brief  period of abstinence.  
 
Product  Accountability:  
Participants  will be required  to keep  track  of all the cigarettes  provided  to them.  Therefore,  they 
will be instructed to return all unused cigarettes and empty cigarette packs to the laboratory 
each week.  Research staff will complete the ‘Product Accountability Log’ with the participants. 
Any discrepancies in the product dispensed versus product returned will be discussed and 
recorded in the log.  Empty  cigarette packs  will not be saved.  Unused cigarette packs  will be re - 
distributed to the participants during Weeks 1 -11. During Week 12, any remaining unused 
cigarettes returned by the participants will be collected by the research staff.  
 
Participants  who report  running  out of cigarettes  prior to a sche duled weekly  visit will be allowed 
to come  in for an unscheduled  visit to obtain  more  research  cigarettes.  If a participant  has more 
than two unanticipated  visits  we will determine  if a rate change  is necessary.  To determine  this, 
we will look  at the past two CO levels as compared to the Baseline 2 CO.  If the CO trend is 
consistent  with the self-report  of smoking  all of the allotted  cigarettes  then a rate increase  will be 
granted.  The participant will then receive cigarettes at a rate of 175% of  their daily smoking 
rate. The maximum increase is  200% of  their daily smoking  rate. If participants lose more than 
two packs of cigarettes and require an unscheduled visit to the laboratory to supplement their  
31  supply,  they will be told the next time they lose more  than two packs  they will have  to wait until 
their next scheduled appointment to receive more cigarettes.  
Statistical  Methods  and Sample  Size 
Statistical  methods . See Statistical  Analysis  Plan at the end of this Supplemental document.  
 
Sample size. Sample size for other analyses was determined using power analysis for 
hypothesis tests related to the Primary Aim of Study 2, specifically to detect a significant 
difference between the reduced -nicotine conditions and the high -nicotine yield condition in the 
primary  endpoints,  cigarettes  per day (CPD)  and urine cotinine,  at the end of  the trial.  Donny  et 
al. (2015) found a reduction of  4.52 CPD and  6.07 CPD among  subjects smoking  0.12 mg and 
0.03 mg cigarettes, respectively, compared to those smoking normal nicotine cigarettes.  In 
addition, they reported a decrease of 0.59 and 0.39 in urine cotinine among those smoking 
these same RNC cigarettes, compared to those smoking NNC cigarettes.  A sample s ize of  69 
completers per condition will provide 90% power to detect similar differences in CPD and 
greater than 95% power to detect differences in urine cotinine, with a two -sided type I error 
rates of  0.02.  The type I error rate reflects the Bonferroni co rrection needed to allow testing of 
all pair -wise comparisons.  Regarding fMRI power, the analysis was based on the estimated 
effect size of 2.04 (Cohen's d) from the cortical activation differences previously observed 
between  smokers  and ex-smokers  on the same  inhibitory  control  task proposed  here (Nestor  et 
al., 2011).  With 20 completers in each condition, there is 80% power at p = 0.05 to detect 
effects about half as large (Cohen d=0.91) between any two conditions.  
 
Potential  Risks of Participation  
1) Survey  Questionnaires : The interview  will include  questions  about  medical  history,  drug 
and alcohol  use, and questionnaires  about  mood.  Answering  these personal  questions 
could make the participant feel uncomfortable.  
2) Breach  of Confidentialit y: The risk of the interview  is loss of privacy  if other  people  find 
out the results.  
3) Coercion : Coercion  is a possible  risk due to monetary  compensation  for participating  in 
these studies.  The likelihood of this risk is low because the compensation is 
commensurate with the amount of time and effort required for these studies.  
4) Drug  Testing : A breach of  confidentiality  could  occur  and other  people could learn of  the 
participant’s  drug use. 
5) Obtaining blood pressure : The blood pressure cuff may cause minimal discomfort.  In 
obtaining  blood  pressure,  researchers  may find out the participant  has abnormal  blood 
pressure.  
6) Smoking  Cigarettes : All cigarettes  are detrimental  to a person’s  health  and can lead to 
significant  medical  problems  including:  
a. Cardiovascular Diseases: Coronary heart disease, heart attack, stroke, 
peripheral  vascular  disease,  reduced  blood  circulation,  abdominal  aortic 
aneurysm  
b. Respiratory  Diseases:  Emphysema,  bronchitis,  and chronic  airway  obstruction  
c. Cancers:  Cancer  of the lung,  bladder,  cervix,  esophagus,  kidney,  larynx,  mouth, 
pancreas, throat, and stomach; leukemia  
d. Metabolic  Diseases:  Type  2 Diabetes  
32  e. Other Health Risks Associated with Smoking: Including but not limit ed to 
infertility,  lower  bone  density  in postmenopausal  women,  and hip fracture  in 
women  
f. Death  
7) Smoking study cigarettes : In addition to the above medical problems, participants may 
experience some minor adverse health effects such as headaches or experienc e 
withdrawal symptoms, which are listed below.  Due to the altered nicotine levels, there 
could be a change in their cigarette use including the manner in which they inhale the 
smoke.  Smoking the study cigarettes does not provide any less risk than their usual 
brand  cigarette  and could  pose  increased  health  risks.  Participants  may also experience 
increases in levels of carbon monoxide, a gas from smoke.  
8) Smoking  Withdrawal : Participants  may experience  smoking  withdrawal  symptoms  during 
this study.  The symptoms can be uncomfortable but are typically of minimal risk. 
Smoking withdrawal symptoms include:  
a. Anger,  irritability,  frustration  
b. Anxiousness,  nervousness  
c. Depressed  mood  or sadness  
d. Desire  or craving  to smoke  
e. Difficulty  concentrating  
f. Increased  appetite,  hunger  or weight  gain 
g. Insomnia,  problems  sleeping  or awakening  at night 
h. Restlessness  
i. Impatience  
j. Constipation  
k. Dizziness  
l. Coughing  
m. Dreaming  or nightmares  
n. Nausea  
o. Sore Throat  
9) Returning to Regular Smoking:  It is possible that if participants return to smoking their 
usual  brand  of cigarette  at the end of the study  they may experience  mild and transient 
nausea, dizziness, and lightheadedness.  
10) Risk to Fetus : Smoking during pregnancy can lead to miscarriage, preterm delivery, 
stillbirth,  low birth weight,  problems  with the placenta,  birth defects  such  as cleft palate, 
sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), and early childhood behavioral problems.  
11) Changes in blood pressure and/or heart rate : Smoking and nicotine can affect the 
cardiovascular system,  which may  result  in changes  in blood  pressure  and/or  heart  rate. 
12) Exacerbation  of psychiatric  symptoms : Smoking  and nicotine  can affect  a person’s  mood 
and emotions and are associated with psychiatric disorders including major depressive 
disorder, general anxiety disorder, bipolar disorder and eating disorders.  Any changes 
in nicotine or cigarettes consumption could adversely affect psychiatric conditions.  
13) MRI: The MRI scanner produces a lou d banging noise and may be uncomfortable for 
people who become anxious in confined spaces.  The presence of metal in or on a 
participant’s  body during  an MRI scan can present a  serious health risk.  The MRI staff 
will ask participants in detail about any pos sible metal they may have in or on them. 
Regarding  unexpected  MRI findings,  the participant  will be informed  of what  was found. 
In addition, information about the incidental finding can be provided to the participant’s 
primary  doctor  or the study  team  can refer them  to an appropriate  specialist.  The costs  
33  for any care that would  be needed  to diagnose  or treat an incidental  finding  would  not be 
covered by the research study and would be the responsibility of the participant.  
Avoiding  Risks  to Fetus:  
If participants choose to be sexually active, they should use an appropriate “double barrier” 
method  of birth control  (such  as female  use of a diaphragm,  or contraceptive sponge,  in addition 
to male use of a condom) or the female should be using prescribed “birth control” pills, patch, 
ring, injections, or implants or intrauterine device (IUD).  Participants will be tested for  
pregnancy every two weeks beginning at screening through the last study visit. If a participant 
becomes pregnant duri ng the study, she will be withdrawn from the study.  Approximately 30 
days after being withdrawn or having a positive pregnancy test at the last study visit, the 
research  staff will call the participant  to confirm  her due date.  The licensed  medical  professi onal 
will follow -up with the participant after delivery to ask questions about the baby’s health.  
Expected  benefits  of participation:  
There  are no immediate  benefits  from participating  in the study.  The information  obtained  from 
this study may ultimately help the Food and Drug Administration decide how best to regulate 
tobacco products with the goal of improving public health.  
 
Study  Debriefing:  
After  data collection  is complete,  participants  will receive  a letter  telling  them  which  condition 
they were randomized into and the results of the study thus far.  
 
Protection  Against  Risk 
Research data without identifiers will be maintained in a locked file cabinet and on password - 
protected computers in the research staff workplace, with only code numbers identifying 
subjects.  Study consent forms and the linkage between the participants’ names and codes will 
be stored  in a locked  file cabinet.  Interviews with  participants  will be conducted  in private  rooms. 
Urine samples for drug and pregnancy tests and tobacco exposure biomarkers will be obtained 
in a private bathroom within the laboratory suite. Blood draws will be performed in a private 
patient room.  Subjective measures will be administered electron ically.  The biostatistics and 
data-management team will provide consistent data -management practices for all data in the 
Center.  Validity and reliability of data will  be maximized by  using REDCap, which is housed on 
the Fletcher Allen Health Care, HIPAA co mpliant, computing system.  REDCap is a secure, 
web-based system that accommodates local and remote data collection by each project team, 
and allows for data entry work -flow monitoring and data quality control monitoring by biometry 
staff.  For data integrit y, data entry windows will follow the structure of paper forms as much as 
possible to allow for ease of entry, and will use predefined choices to minimize errors when 
possible.  Data quality monitoring will be facilitated with periodic  down loads and analys is using 
a variety of common statistical program format such as SAS, Stata, R, and SPSS.  Quality 
control procedures will be conducted for all data collected, including analysis of missing data 
and logic checks for out of range and other anomalous values.  This secure electronic data 
gathering and transmission plan, overseen by the experienced biostatistical team, will minimize 
opportunities for breaches of confidentiality.  Biological samples for nicotine and carcinogen 
biomarker analysis will be marked with participant ID, stored in the locked laboratory suite, and 
sent to a laboratory for analysis on a quarterly basis.  
34  All information collected as part of this study will be accessible only to research staff.  No 
information will be shared with p articipants’ clinicians unless the participant requests this in 
writing.  All investigators and staff have undergone (and any new staff will undergo) human 
subjects’ ethics training as required by UVM and are fully conversant with relevant ethical 
principal s around  confidentiality.  Assessments,  consenting  and study  procedures  will be closely 
supervised by the PI.  
 
The sponsors (NIDA/FDA) as well as the Institutional Review Board and regulatory authorities 
could  be granted  direct  access  to original  medical  and research  records  for verification  of clinical 
trial procedures and/or data.  If this is required, it will be done under conditions that will protect 
privacy to the fullest extent possible consistent with laws relating to public disclosure of 
information  and the law -enforcement responsibilities of the agency.  
Data  Storage:  
Data will be stored locally at each site, at the University of Minnesota Masonic Cancer Center’s 
Bioinformatics  Core and  at the University  of Vermont.  Long -term storage  of all study  data, for at 
least 7 years after study completion, will be at the University of Vermont.  
 
Adverse  Events  
The research assistant will ask about adverse events at each session, using a form that 
assesses the nature, severity, duration, action taken, and outcome of study -related adverse 
events.  AEs will be captured from the time of first study cigarette. Participants will be given 
contact cards to inform us of events that occur between study contacts.  Any AE that remains 
open will be reviewed and closed at  an interview conducted 30 days after the study completion 
date (completers)  or when  the study  should  have ended  had the participant  completed  the study 
(dropouts and those withdrawn by investigator).  
All procedures will be monitored to ensure that they conform to the approved protocol.  In 
addition, monitoring will be done of all unforeseen circumstances that might arise and affect 
safety; of all reports of serious adverse events as defined in 38 CFR 46 (death, new or 
prolonged hospitalization, persi stent or significant disability/incapacity); of other significant 
adverse events (adverse events that lead to drop out by the participant or termination by the 
investigator);  of unexpected  adverse  events  resulting  from the study,  and of expected  adverse 
events.  
 
Any SAE will be brought to the attention of the site PIs as soon as possible and not longer than 
24 hours.  Any AE or SAE that is both unexpected and related to study participation will be 
reported to the IRB within 7 days of the event.  The local IRB  will make a determination as to 
whether additional reporting requirements are needed.  IRB actions will be reported to the 
funding agency by the PIs no less than annually and more frequently as recommended by the 
local IRB.  Any SAEs will be summarized in the yearly Progress Reports to the funding agency, 
including a review of frequency and severity.  All SAEs will be followed through ongoing 
consultation with the physician caring for the patient until they resolve, result in death, or 
stabiliz e and are not expected to improve.  The study staff will be in close contact with 
participants  and health  care providers  throughout  the study  to monitor  for potential  unanticipated  
35  problems.  Any unanticipated  problems  will be discussed  at the weekly  research  staff meetings 
and reported as required to the local IRB.  
Withdrawal  or Monitoring  of Participants  
For the participant’s  protection,  participants  will be withdrawn  immediately  from  the 
study if any of the following occur:  
1) Cardiovascular disease (CVD) event : Typically include s MI (heart attack), PTCA 
(angioplasty/stenting), bypass surgery, stroke, peripheral vascular disease (arterial 
blockages in arms or legs leading to procedure or surgery).  Less common CVD 
problems  would  be new cardiac  arrhythmias  (e.g.,  new atrial  fibrillation)  or new valvular 
disease (e.g., mitral or aortic regurgitation).  
2) DVT/PE  (deep  vein thrombosis/pulmonary  embolism,  i.e., blood  clots in the venous 
system).  
3) Suicide Attempt : A participant  will be withdrawn if he/she  attempts  suicide  at any time 
during participation in the study.  
4) Psychiatric  Hospitalization : A participant  will be withdrawn  if he/she  is hospitalized  for 
psychiatric reasons at any time during participation in the study.  
5) Pregnancy : If participant indicates she is pregnant or has a positive pregnancy test at 
any time during the study, she will be withdrawn from the study, and this event will 
remain open  until delivery.  At that time the licensed  medical  professional  will contact  the 
participant to ask a few questions about the baby’s health and will update the open 
‘Medical Event  Form’.  A positive pregnancy test  at Session  14 in Study 1  or Week  12 in 
Study 2 will trigger a ‘Medical Event Form’ to be compl eted but will not result in 
withdrawal since she is no longer receiving study product.  
6) Expired  breath  carbon  monoxide  increase : A participant  will be withdrawn  from the study 
if the average of two consecutive CO readings during the same visit is 100 ppm or  
greater.  
7) Marked  increase  in smoking : A participant  will be withdrawn  from the study  if he/she 
meets BOTH of the following criteria for two consecutive weeks  
a. Cigarette  per day increase:  The average  CPD  increases  by more  than 100% 
from the average CPD during baseline.  
b. Expired  breath  carbon  monoxide  increase:  If the average  of two consecutive  CO 
measurements in the same visit is  
i. CO is greater  than 50 ppm if CO at Baseline  1 is <20 ppm.  
ii. CO is greater than  60 ppm if  CO at Baseline  1 is 20 – 34 ppm.  
iii. CO is greater than  70 ppm if  CO at Baseline  1 is 35 – 49 ppm.  
iv. CO is greater than  80 ppm if CO at Baseline  1 is 50 – 64 ppm.  
v. CO is greater than  90 ppm if  CO at Baseline  1 is 65 – 80 ppm.  
8) Note:  If the second  consecutive  visit is the last study  visit, then the participant  would  not 
be withdrawn from the study.  
 
The following  will be monitored  and can lead to the participant  being  withdrawn  by the PI 
or Licensed Medical Professional:  
1) Cigarettes per day increase : Continued participation will be evaluated by the site PI if 
the average  number  of cigarettes  per day (CPD)  increases  by more than  100%  from the 
average CPD during baseline as determined by CPD at Baseline 2.  
36  2) Blood pressure (BP) or heart rate (HR) changes : If any of the following occur post - 
enrollment: 1) BP is at or above 160/100 or below 90/50, or 2) HR is at or above 115 
bpm or below 45 bpm a manual blood pressure and heart rate measurement will be 
taken  after 10 minutes  have  passed.  If the manual  reading  is still out of range,  a ‘Blood 
Pressure and Heart Rate Symptom Checklist’ and ‘Medical Event Form’ will be 
completed, and the participant will be monitored by the medical professional.  
3) Expired breath Carbon Monoxide increase : If the average of two consecutive CO 
measurements  meet s the criteria  below  then the ‘Medical  Event  Form’  will be completed 
and the participant will be monitored by the licensed medical professional.  
a. CO is greater  than 50 ppm if CO at Baseline  1 is <20 ppm.  
b. CO is greater than  60 ppm if  CO at Baseline  1 is 20 – 34 ppm.  
c. CO is greater than  70 ppm if  CO at Baseline  1 is 35 – 49 ppm.  
d. CO is greater  than 80 ppm if CO at Baseline  1 is 50 – 64 ppm.  
e. CO is greater than  90 ppm if  CO at Baseline  1 is 65 – 80 ppm.  
4) Any hospitalization or debilitation in which participation in the study could be detrimental 
to the recovery  process.  This will be self-reported  by the participant  and will be reviewed 
by the site PI and licensed medical professional to determine whether continued 
participation in the study is approp riate.  
5) If a participant is behaving in an inappropriate or threatening manner, admits to lying 
about eligibility criteria, is participating in other smoking research studies that could 
affect  the primary  outcome  measures,  etc., then the PI can withdraw  him/her  from the 
study at the PI’s discretion.  
6) If a participant  fails to attend  regularly  scheduled research  assessment  visits  or comply 
with the research procedures or schedule, then the PI can withdraw him/her from the 
study at the PI’s discreti on. 
7) Increase in psychiatric symptoms:  Exacerbation in symptoms noted during the study 
(i.e., change in BDI category from mild to moderate or moderate to severe) will trigger 
review  by the study’s  licensed  medical  professional.  The PI will withdraw  the participant 
upon the licensed medical professional’s recommendation.  
 
Data  Safety  Monitoring  Board  
A Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) has been established to monitor safety outcomes 
and will  be comprised of  five members.  The DSMB  will be chaired  by Dr. Eden Evins,  Associate 
Professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and Director of the Center for Addiction 
Medicine at Massachusetts General Hospital. Other members include: Kevin Delucchi, PhD., 
Professor in Residence of Biostatistics in Psychia try at the University of California San 
Francisco and Director of the Quantitative Core of the San Francisco Treatment Research 
Center;  Hendree E.  Jones,  Ph.D.,  Professor of  Obstetrics  and Gynecology  and Director of  UNC 
Horizons at University of North Caro lina Chapel Hill; Wallace Pickworth, Ph.D., Research 
Leader, Baltimore Operation, Centers for Public Health Research and Evaluation, Battelle; 
Kimber  Richter,  Ph.D.,  M.P.H.,  Associate  Professor  of Preventive  Medicine  and Public  Health  at 
the University of Kansas and Director of the University of Kansas Hospital’s tobacco treatment 
program.  
 
Conflict  of interest  
None  of the members  will be otherwise  affiliated  with the center and  each  member  will complete 
a conflict of interest  disclosure form  prior to  each meeting.  Ad hoc specialists may  be invited to 
participate as non -voting members at any time if additional expertise is desired.  
37  Monitoring  activities  and frequency  of meetings  
The DSMB will set their own agenda and decisions about monitoring; e.g. how frequently to 
monitor,  what  threshold  requires  changes  to protocol  or stopping  the study,  and whether  to view 
raw or analyzed data.  The DSMB will be given FDA and EMEA guidelines for DSMBs and 
recent reviews on DSMB s. A brief report will be generated from each meeting for the study 
record and forwarded to each of the study site’s Institutional Review Boards (IRB) and NIDA’s 
Program  Officer  with the progress  report.  The DSMB  will be available  to convene  outside  of the 
regular meetings, if necessary.  If concerns should arise regarding a particular subject, or any 
troublesome trends in the experiences of participants, they will make appropriate 
recommendations  for changes  in protocol,  as needed.  The project  investigat ors will continue to 
examine safety data, blind to study condition, in case they wish to make study  
modifications.  Before  modifications  are made,  they will inform  the DSMB  and request  their 
comments.  
 
Communication  plan to IRB, NIDA,  and FDA (if applicable)  
All IRBs,  the FDA and the NIDA’s  Program  Officer will  be informed of  any significant  action 
taken as a result of the Data and Monitoring Board’s findings.  Study Participants will be 
informed of any changes in risk.  
 
Protection  of confidentialit y 
For DSMB  meetings  only de-identified  data,  including  blinded  study  site and condition  type,  will 
be provided to the board.  All data and discussion during the meeting will be confidential.  
 
Investigational  Tobacco Product  
The Vermont Center on Tobacco and Regulatory Science has received an Investigational 
Tobacco  Product  (ITP)  application  from the FDA to cover  the experimental  cigarettes  being 
used in this study.  This application encompasses both trial sites.  
 
Certificate  of Confidentiality  
To help protect  the participant’s  privacy,  Dr. Stephen Higgins,  PhD,  has received a Certificate of 
Confidentiality from the National Institutes of Health.  With this certificate, the researchers 
cannot be forced to disclose information that may identify the par ticipants, even by a court 
subpoena, in any federal, state, or local civil, criminal, administrative, legislative, or other 
proceedings.  The researchers  will use the Certificate to resist  any demands  for information that 
would identify the participants, ex cept as explained below.  The Certificate cannot be used to 
resist  a demand  for information  from personnel  of the United  States  Government  that is used  for 
auditing or evaluation of federally funded projects or for information that must be disclosed in 
order to meet the requirements of the Federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  
The Certificate of Confidentiality does not prevent the participant or a member of their family 
from voluntarily  releasing  information  about  themself  and their involvement  in the research.  If 
an insurer, employer or other person obtains the participant’s written consent to receive 
research information, then the researcher may n ot use the Certificate to withhold that 
information.  
The Certificate  of Confidentiality  does  not prevent  the researchers  from disclosing  voluntarily, 
without consent, information that would identify the individual  as a participant of the  research 
project in instances such as  evidence of child abuse or a participant's threatened violence to 
self or others.

49  Protocol 
Objective : 
The primary overall objective of this study is to evaluate the effects of extended exposure to 
cigarettes  differing  in nicotine  content  in opioid -mainta ined smokers  using  a 3-condition,  parallel 
groups design.  After a baseline period in which daily smoking rate and other baseline 
assessments are completed, participants will be randomly assigned to one of three cigarette 
conditions (0.0 3, 0.12 mg, and 0.8 mg machine estimated nicotine  delivery per cigarette ) for the 
12-week experimental period.  
 
Background Information:  
The 2009 Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act (FSPTCA) gives the Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA) regulatory authority over tobacco products, including nicotine levels 
in cigarettes.  That is an exciting development as it creates the opportunity to examine the 
Benowitz and Henningfield (1994) hypothesis that smoking prevalence, nicotine dependence, 
and smoking -related morbidity and mortality can be lowered substantially by reducing the 
nicotine  content  of cigarettes  to non-addictive  levels.  Computer  modeling  predicts  that reducing 
nicotine levels in cigarettes would produce substantial improvements in po pulation health 
(Tengs et al., 2005).  An essential initial step towards the implementation of such a policy is to 
thoroughly investigate its safety and potential unintended adverse consequences.  Indeed, the 
FDA’s Center for Tobacco Products seeks to establ ish research centers to assist with the 
mission of investigating such regulatory matters related to the FSPTCA (see RFA -DA-13-003). 
The FDA explicitly notes that researching tobacco regulatory questions in vulnerable 
populations is a crosscutting agency pr iority, listing opioid -dependent adults among the 
vulnerable populations of interest.  
 
Prevalence of  smoking  among  opioid -dependent  adults far  exceeds  that of the general  US adult 
population (84 -94% vs. 20%, respectively) (Clemmey  et al., 1997; Nahvi et al., 2006; Richter et 
al., 2001; SAMHSA, 2007).  Opioid -dependent smokers are also at elevated risk for smoking - 
related adverse health effects.  Smoking in this group is associated with significant morbidity 
and mortality (Engstrom e t al., 1991; Hser et al., 1994; Hurt et al., 1996), with the mortality rate 
of opioid -dependent smokers estimated at four -fold that of opioid -dependent nonsmokers (Hser 
et al., 1994), and individuals with substance use disorders more likely to die of tobac co-related 
disorders such as lung and larynx cancer and respiratory disease than the general population 
(Grinshpoon et al., 2011).  In addition to these direct  adverse  health consequences of smoking, 
opioid -dependent  smokers  also present  with additional  unique risk  factors  related to their opioid 
dependence  that may further  increase  their risk. First,  opioid -maintained  patients  are already  at 
elevated risk for adverse cardiac effects. Methadone is a potent blocker of the delayed rectifier 
potassium ion chann el. Chronic administration has cardiac toxicity and arrhythogenic potential 
and can produce QT -prolongation and Torsades de Pointes (polymorphic ventricular 
tachycardia) in susceptible patients (Andrews et al., 2009; George et al., 2008; Justo et al., 
2006 ; Huh & Park, 2010; Modesto -Lowe et al., 2010; Roy et al., 2012; Stringer et al., 2009; 
Wallner et al., 2008).  Second, acute and chronic opioid administration is also associated with 
weight gain, glycemic dysregulation, and dental pathology.  A recent revie w by Mysels and 
Sullivan (2010), for example, found that activation of the mu -opioid receptor is associated with 
increased sweet, or palatable, taste preference, hyperglycemia induced by direct action on  
50  pancreatic islet cells and potential i nsulin resistance caused by dietary preference for sugary 
foods.  Increased  preference for  and ingestion  of sweet  foods  is associated with weight  gain and 
tooth decay.  The authors concluded that methadone -maintained patients are especially 
susceptible to weight gain and diabetes, and have poor follow -up with primary care treatment, 
thereby making them a population with multiple vulnerabilities.  Finally, opioid -dependent 
patients demonstrate generally poor adherence to medication regimens, wh ich likely interferes 
with their ability to take advantage of available pharmacotherapies for smoking cessation.  For 
example, in a 12 -week trial investigating the efficacy of bupropion plus nicotine replacement 
therapy (NRT) on smoking cessation among meth adone -maintained smokers, 53% reported 
using their bupropion less often than prescribed (Richter et al., 2005).  In a subsequent 
randomized trial investigating the efficacy of NRT on smoking cessation among methadone 
patients,  only 34% of participants  in that study  used  their assigned NRT  (i.e., transdermal  patch) 
through the end of the study (Reid et al., 2008).  In both studies, suboptimal pharmacotherapy 
adherence likely contributed to the poor cessation rates observed.  Taken together, in addition 
to the d irect adverse consequences associated with smoking alone, combined use of tobacco 
and opioids  may produce  additive  or even synergistic  increases  in risk  for adverse health effects 
from tobacco use in this population.  
 
Importance  of Evaluating  VLNC  Cigarett es in this Vulnerable  Group  of Smokers:  
The studies summarized in the prior section provide compelling evidence that VLNC cigarettes 
can substitute for usual brand cigarettes and that extended exposure to VLNC cigarettes may 
reduce smoking rate, toxicant exposure, and severity of nicotine dependence.  These findings 
underscore the tremendous potential this innovative public policy strategy has for reducing 
smoking prevalence and smoking -related disease and death in the US.  However, a serious 
limita tion of these studies  that is directly  relevant  to this  proposal  is that they uniformly  excluded 
vulnerable populations.  This is an important gap in knowledge that must be addressed to 
comprehensively evaluate the Benowitz and Henningfield hypothesis.  Unde rstanding how 
smokers with substance use disorders (SUDs) and other vulnerabilities to smoking and 
smoking -related problems respond to reduced -nicotine cigarettes is essential for evaluating the 
potential impact of a nicotine reduction policy.  This project  represents the first investigation of 
reduced -nicotine  cigarettes  in opioid -dependent  smokers  and stands  to contribute  new scientific 
information with the potential to directly inform FDA policy decisions.  
 
Cigarettes  to be assessed  in this study:  
The cigarettes  to be used  in this study  were  made  under  an NIH contract  with production  being 
overseen by the Research Triangle Institute (referred to as “Spectrum cigarettes”).  NIH 
currently has approximately 10 million  of these cigarettes (of varying types) for research 
purposes.  The cigarettes selected for the study span the range of yields likely to produce the 
hypothesized effects,  as described above.  Spectrum cigarettes  are not  currently  commercially 
available, alth ough they are similar in many ways to marketed cigarettes (e.g., similar 
manufacturing, filter, paper, etc.).  
51  Screening  Procedures 
Recruitment:  
A sample size of 207 completers is proposed to test the primary outcome.  Anticipating 25% 
attrition, and six pilot participants (3 at UVM, 3 at JHU), 282 participants will be enrolled across 
both sites (188 at UVM, 94 at JHU). Potential participants will respond to community 
advertisements (local newspapers, community bulletin boards, lab Facebook page, Facebook 
ads, lab website,  center  website,  Craigslist,  city buses,  etc.) that contain a study  description,  link 
to an online survey and the name and phone number of the Research Assistant. Participants 
can choose to complete the pre-screening questionnaire online or by phone. If deemed eligible, 
those who complete the online questionnaire will be called by the Research Assistant to further 
discuss the study. The RA will read a script briefly explaining the study. Participants will  be 
informed that this is not a smoking cessation program, and that smoking cessation services are 
available in the community  independent  of their decision to  participate in this  study.  If interested, 
they will be scheduled for an in -person screening interview. Those who call into the laboratory 
will be read a script briefly explaining the study.  After verbal informed consent is received, the 
participants will be asked questions  over the phone to determine initial eligibility.  Callers will be  
informed that this is not a smoking cessation program, and that smoking cessation services are 
available in the community independent of their decision to participate in this study.  If eligible 
and interested, they will be scheduled for an in -person scree ning interview.  
Potential participants will be instructed to bring a pack of their usual brand cigarettes, all 
prescription  medications  they are currently  taking  and identification  (example,  driver’s  license)  to 
the screening visit. If participants anticip ate not having acceptable ID site staff should consult 
with the project coordinator or study PI.  
A participant must complete his/her in -person screening session within 30 days of completing 
the pre -screening  questionnaire.  If the participant  is not able to  attend the in -person screening 
visit in that timeframe, he/she will need to complete the pre -screening questionnaire again.  
 
Informed  Consent  Process:  
Before beginning the informed consent process, potential participants will need to produce 
identificatio n as described above.  The interviewer will confirm the age and identity of the 
participant.  If the participant is not between the ages of 18 and 70, he/she will be dismissed 
without payment.  During the in -person screening session, study information will be  presented 
and written informed consent will be required prior to participating in the screening session.  In 
order to ensure adequate informed consent, participants will be asked to read the first several 
lines aloud (to determine literacy) and will then b e given ample time to read the consent 
document.  If the interviewer suspects the participant is not literate, he or she will have them 
continue  reading  further  to confirm.  Inability  to read and comprehend  written  study  materials  will 
result in ineligibility and the interviewer will inform the participant that they  are not eligible. Only 
after the participant and the researcher are fully satisfied that the participant understands the 
purpose of the study, the confidentiality of the data, the proc edures, the risks/benefits and 
his/her rights as a research participant will the consent form be signed and the participant 
undergo screening procedures.  
 
Screening  Measures  
Those  who consent  will be screened  for eligibility  using  the following  measures:  
52  The following  physiological  measures  will be collected,  recorded  on paper,  and entered 
into REDCap by the interviewer at the end of the visit:  
1) Breath alcohol levels (BAL)  will be measured using an Alcosensor monitor.  Participants 
with levels  over 0.01 g/l may reschedule  the interview  but will need  to be re-consented  to 
ensure  they have  received  adequate  informed  consent.  They  will be excluded  if they are 
positive the second time.  
2) Weight  and height  will be measured  to determine  the participant’s  Body  Mass  Index.  
Weight  will be measured  in kilograms  and height  will be measured  in centimeters.  
3) Expired breath carbon monoxide (CO)  levels will be assessed using a Smokerlyzer 
ED50  CO meter  (Bedfont  Instruments),  a reliable  and valid measure  of recent  smoking.  
a. NicAlert  Strips  will be used  to asses  urinary  cotinine  levels  if a participant's 
carbon monoxide reading is less than or equal to 8 ppm.  
4) A urine toxicological screen  will be performed to assess the presence of illicit drugs 
including marijuana, cocaine, opiates, oxycodone, benzodiazepines, barbiturates, 
amphetamines, methadone, buprenorphine, methamphetamines, MDMA and PCP. 
Participants who fail the drug screen for dr ugs other than marijuana or their prescribed 
opioid medication may reschedule the interview but will need to be re -consented to 
ensure  they have  received  adequate  informed  consent.  They  will be excluded  if they are 
positive for drugs (other than marijuana or prescribed opioid medication) the second 
time.  
5)   Urine  Pregnancy  Test (HCG  detection)  will be performed  for all participants.  
6) Blood  pressure  and heart  rate will be measured  using  a CritiCare  monitor  to help the 
licensed medical professional determine final participant eligibility.  
 
The following  screening  questionnaires  will be participant -administered  via paper  and 
then will be entered into REDCap by the interviewer at the end of the visit:  
1) Identifying Infor mation Form  will include the participant’s REDCap Subject Identifier, 
name,  address  (including  the county  of residence),  email  address,  phone  number,  age, 
date of birth, and social security number (if applicable).  
a. This form will be entered  into the ‘Identifying  Information  Access  Database’.  
i. Each  site will have  a separate  ‘Identifying  Information  Access  Database’.  
ii. Identifying  information  will not be shared  with other  sites.  Each  site is 
responsible for maintaining confidentiality of this information.  
iii. Identifying information will be kept in a locked file cabinet (source

structured diagnostic interview to evaluate psychiatric disorders.  
a. Will be completed  by participant  through  the In-Home  Screening  system 
supported by Medical Outcomes Systems.  
 
In the event that the REDCap  website is not functioning, the assessments will be printed out 
and administered  on paper.  The source documents  will be kept  in the  participant’s  binder.  The 
interviewer will enter the data into REDCap when it resumes functioning properly.  This 
informatio n should  be recorded  in the ‘End of Visit Evaluation  Form’  and filed in the participant’s 
binder.  
Suicidality/Mental  Health  Monitoring  
Participants who endorse any suicidal ideation questions, indicate suicidal intention in the past 
month or a suicide attempt in the past  6 months as indicated on the BDI (score > 0 on question 
9) or MINI suicide subscale (endorse question 3, 4 and/or 5 on the MINI suicide subscale or 
question 6 on the MINI suicide subscale with suicide attempt in the past 6 month s) or answer 
“yes” to question A3g on the MINI Neuropsychiatric interview and symptoms have occurred in 
the past two weeks,  will not be eligible  to participate  in the study.  The research  staff member  will 
contact  a licensed on -site clinician for evaluation . In the event  that no clinician is  available,  staff 
will put the participant in contact with the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1 -800-273- 
54  8255.  They  will also contact  the Study  Coordinator  and Site PI to inform  them  of the situation  as 
soon as possible.  Additionally, they will contact the Project Coordinator to inform her of the 
situation. The participant will be paid $25 (+$25 bonus is applicable) and provided with local 
mental health resources. Post enrollment, any report of suicidal ideation or attempt by a 
participant will be grounds for immediate withdrawal from the study.

21) Co- habitation  with any former  research  participant  who was provided  with Spectrum 
research cigarettes to smoke outside the lab  
 
Children under age 18 are excluded because they cannot legally buy cigarettes.  Those with 
unstable medical, psychiatric, or medication conditions (as determined by the licensed medical 
professional)  are excluded  as these  symptoms  could  affect  a participant ’s ability  to complete  the 
study.  Examples include but are not limited to the following: angina, stroke, heart attack which 
occurred since phone screening, blood clots in the arms or legs for which the individual is 
undergoing  active  medical  treatment,  cancer requiring  active  chemotherapy  or radiation  therapy, 
severe shortness of breath caused by conditions such as uncontrolled asthma, COPD, or 
arrhythmia, active untreated infection such as pneumonia, active untreated endocrine disorder 
such as  hyperthyroidism.  We will exclude those currently seeking  smoking  treatment  and those 
who plan to quit in the next 30 days, as participation in this study may not lead to reductions in 
smoking.  We will  exclude  pregnant  or nursing  women and women  of reproduc tive potential  who 
are unwilling  to use  acceptable forms  of birth control  throughout  the study.  We will  also exclude  
56  anyone with current or recent alcohol or drug abuse problems as these factors could 
independently  affect  smoking  behavior  during the study.  Individuals  with baseline  CO readings 
greater than 80 ppm, those with heart rate or blood pressure readings that are out of range 
(systolic: 90 -159 mmHg; diastolic: 50 -99 mmHg; HR: 45 -114 bpm) and anyone who has 
attempted suicide in the past six months will be excluded from the study for safety concerns.  
Individuals who smoke ‘roll your own’ cigarettes exclusively will be excluded from the study 
because  we will be unable  to standardize  their baseline  smoking  behavior.  Individuals  who have  
recently participated in a research study will be excluded as participation may have changed 
their smoking behavior, which may preclude a stable smoking baseline.  Because participants 
are required to complete portions of the protocol independently, they w ill need to be able to 
independently read and comprehend the study materials.  
 
Eligibility  Determination:  
The research assistant will review the entire screening assessment battery for initial eligibility 
determination, confirming the subject meets the above described inclusion/exclusion criteria. 
The final eligibility of the participant will be determined by  a licensed medical professional (MD, 
DO, NP, PA, Master’s prepared RN or CRN) at each site after reviewing the Medical History 
Questionnaire, BDI, Mini Neuropsychiatric Interview, and the MINI suicide subscale.  The 
licensed medical professional may meet wi th a participant if available and think it necessary for 
eligibility determination.  He/she will sign off on eligibility prior to the first baseline visit.  If the 
licensed medical  professional  determines  the participant  is not medically  eligible to  particip ate in 
the study, has current symptomatology that would interfere with interpretation of the data or is 
unlikely to complete the study he/she will inform the research assistants who will contact the 
participant prior to the first baseline visit.  The licens ed medical professional will not need to 
review the medical history forms of participants who are not eligible for other, non -medical 
reasons.  
If a participant  fails the urine  toxicology  screen  due to a prescription  medication  he/she  is taking, 
then he/she will not be automatically excluded.  The interviewer will make note of this when 
he/she submits the forms to the licensed medical professional for final eligibility determination.  
Once all the screening procedures have been completed, researchers wil l pay participants $25 
(+$25 bonus if applicable) for their time as long as they pass the drug and breath alcohol tests 
and meet  the minimum  requirements  for carbon  monoxide  or NicAlert  levels.  Those  participants 
who do not pass these tests or meet these r equirements will be dismissed from the study 
without payment.  Marijuana will be tested for but will not be an exclusionary criterion.  If a 
participant does not pass the drug test but has a current, valid prescription that would explain 
the failed test he/s he will not  be automatically excluded and will still receive the visit payment.  
Participants  who meet  all other  eligibility  criteria,  sans  the medical  criteria,  will be scheduled  for 
the first baseline visit.  
At the end of the screening session, the researcher will complete the End of Visit Evaluation 
Form, which will be filed in the subject’s binder.  This will allow the researcher to make note of 
any problems  encountered  during  the visit, to track  which  computers  were  used  for which  tasks, 
and to ass ess the truthfulness of the participant in regards to self -report of tobacco use.  
57  Baseline  Procedures  
This study will use a one -week, two -session baseline period to collect baseline individual 
difference measures and monitor daily usual -brand  smoking behavior.  At Baseline 1, 
participants will be provided their usual brand cigarettes to smoke, equivalent to 150% of their 
daily smoking  rate. A time line follow  back  (TLFB)  will be used  to assess  the daily cigarette  use 
for the  past 7 days.  Participants will be provided their usual brand cigarettes for the first seven 
days of the baseline period.  If the baseline period extends past seven days, participants will 
need to purchase their own usual brand cigarettes.  Use of a two session baseline p eriod will 
ensure stability of daily smoking reports, reduce reactivity to the daily cigarette monitoring, and 
reduce participant burden.  During the two baseline sessions, participants will complete 
subjective questionnaires, assessments of cognitive funct ioning, and smoking topography.  
Each visit will last approximately two to four hours.  At the end of each baseline session, the 
researcher  will complete  the End of Visit Evaluation  Form,  which  will be filed in the participants’ 
binder.  This will allow the r esearcher to make note of any problems encountered during the 
visit, to track  which computers  were used for which tasks,  and to assess  the truthfulness  of the 
participant in regards to self -report of tobacco use.  
Visit scheduling  requirements  for baseline  period:  
Participants will be required to schedule the Baseline 1 visit within 30 days of their screening 
visit. If a participant still wants to be in the study after 30 days, he/she will need to be re - 
screened.  The participant will need to be re -consented but will maintain the original REDCap 
Subject  Identifier.  The ideal  target  window  separating  Baseline 1 and Baseline 2 is  between 7 
and 12  days.  The minimum  is 7 days  and the maximum  is 21 days.  If the participant  does  not 
complete the visit  within 21 days,  then he/she will  not be rescheduled and will  be discontinued 
from the study.  
Measures/Assessments  
Physiological  measures  collected  at Baseline  1, recorded  on paper,  and entered  into 
REDCap  by the interviewer at the end of the visit:  
1) BAL 
2) Weight  
3) CO 
4) Blood  Pressure  
5) Heart  Rate 
6) Urine  Toxicology  
The following  questionnaires  will be participant -administered  via paper  at Baseline  1 and 
then will be entered into REDCap by the interviewer at the end o f the visit:  
1) BDI 
2) OASIS  
58  The following  assessments  will be administered  as an interview  at Baseline  1 and then 
entered into REDCap by the interviewer at the end of the visit:  
1) Concomitant  Medications  Form  
2) Health  Changes  Questionnaire,  which  will assess  any weekly  health  changes,  
3) Time  Since  Last Cigarette  Questionnaire  
 
The following  assessments  will be administered  at Baseline  1 and completed  by the 
participant directly in REDCap:  
 
1) Perceived  Health  Risks  Rating  (Hatsukami  et al., 2010),  a measure  of the perceived 
addictive potential and other health risks associated with cigarettes  
2) Respiratory  Health  Questionnaire , a measure  of cough,  shortness  of breath  and other 
respiratory symptoms  
3) Minnesota  Nicotine  Withdrawal  Scale  (MNWS;  Hughes  & Hatsukami,  1986),  a measure 
of nicotine withdrawal  
4) Questionnaire  of Smoking  Urges -brief scale - Usual  Cigarette  (QSU;  Cox, Tiffany,  & 
Christen, 2001; Tiffany & Drobes, 1991), which measures the urge to smoke  
5) Cigarette  Evalu ation  Scale  – Usual  Cigarette (CES;  Westman,  Levin,  & Rose,  1992), 
which measures responses to cigarettes (e.g., reward, satisfaction).  
6) Intolerance for Discomfort Questionnaire - (IDQ; Sirota et al., 2013), assesses 
intolerance  for the discomfort  of smoking  abstinence.  The measure  includes  three 
subscales: physical discomfort, emotional discomfort and smoking withdrawal 
discomfort.  
10) Cigarette Purchase Task – Usual Brand Version (CPT; MacKillop et al., 2008), a self - 
report analogue of a progressive -ratio schedule that measures the relative reinforcing 
efficacy of  cigarettes by querying  how many  of that day’s cigarette they would consu me 
in a day at varying  prices.  This task will indicate  whether  prolonged  VLNC  cigarette  use 
reduces cigarette demand and increases sensitivity to increases in cigarette costs.  
11) Perceived  Stress  Scale - 4 item (PSS -4; Cohen,  Kamarck,  & Mermelstein,  1983),  which 
measures the degree to which life situations are appraised as stressful.  
12) Positive  and Negative  Affect  Schedule  (PANAS;  Watson,  Clark,  & Tellegan,  1988), 
which measures symptoms of positive and negative affect.  
 
Physiological  measures  collected  at Baseline  2, recorded  on paper  and entered  into 
REDCap by the interviewer at the end of the visit:  
8) BAL 
9) Weight  
10) CO 
11) Blood  Pressure  
12) Heart  Rate 
13) Urine  Toxicology  
14) Urine  Pregnancy  
59  The following  assessments  will be administered  as an inter view  at Baseline  2 and then 
entered into REDCap by the interviewer at the end of the visit:  
1) Concomitant  Medications  Form  
2) Health  Changes  Questionnaire  
3) Time  Since  Last Cigarette  Questionnaire  
 
The following assessments will be administered at Baseline 2 and completed by the 
participant  on paper  and entered  into REDCap  by the interviewer  at the end of the visit:  
1) BDI 
2) OASIS  
 
The following  assessments  will be administered  at Baseline  2 and completed  by the 
participant directly in REDCap:  
1) FTND  
2) WISDM  
 
In the event that the REDCap website is not functioning, the assessments will be printed out 
and administered  on paper.  The source documents  will be kept  in the  participant’s  binder.  The 
interviewer will ente r the data into REDCap when it resumes functioning properly.  This 
information  should  be recorded  in the ‘End of Visit Evaluation  Form’  and filed in the participant’s 
binder.  
Cognitive  Tasks  (Baseline  2 Only):  
Cognitive  functioning  will be assessed  using  a battery  of computer -based  assessments.  We will 
assess domains that are theoretically linked to smoking and likely to be sensitive to nicotine 
abstinence (Heishman, 1999; Kleykamp et al., 2005; Rycroft et al., 2006).  Prior to test 
administration, pa rticipants will be trained to ensure their understanding of each test.  Tests will 
be administered on a desktop computer.  
6) N-Back (0,2) Task (Ernst et al., 2001): A measure of working memory in which 
participants  view serially  presented  letters  on a computer . They  must  indicate  whether 
each letter presented is the same or different from the letter presented a specified 
number of positions back in the string of letters (e.g. 2 -back).  
7) 2-Letter Search (Ernst et al., 2001): A measure of focused attention in which  
participants  view strings  of letters  on a computer  screen  looking  for whether  each  string 
contains or does not contain two target letters.  
8) Continuous Performance Test (CPT; Myers et. Al., 2008): A measure of sustained 
attention, participants must monitor a string of stimuli (e.g. letters) serially presented on  
a computer  screen  monitoring  for presentation  of a target  stimulus.  The task is balanced 
so that  they either must  respond,  or inhibit  a response each time the target  is presented.  
9) Stop  Signal  Task  (SST;  Logan  et al., 1984):  A computer  administered test  of behavioral 
inhibition.  Participants make frequent motor responses (e.g., left/right responses 
indicating if a visually presented arrow points left or right) and occasional, unpredictable 
response inhibitions (e.g., when a second arrow, pointing upwards, is presented).  The 
stop signal delay (the interval between the onset of the go signal and stop signal) is  
60  adjusted  after each  stop trial according  to the partici pants’  performance  to achieve 50 
percent  inhibition  success  rate. 
10) Nicotine Stroop Task (Stroop, 1935): Frequently used measure of inhibitory control 
functioning. It measures the ability to focus attention on relevant stimuli while ignoring 
distracters and to suppress a prepotent response (i.e., word reading) in favor of an 
atypical one (i.e., color naming).  Participants will be shown a number of images.  The 
images will either be nicotine related, evocative, or neutral in nature with different color 
borders (red, blue, green yellow).  The participants will be asked to use response 
triggers  to identify  the color  of the border  for each  picture  as they appear  on the screen.  
 
Smoking  Topography  (Baseline 2  Only):  
Puff Topography, a precise measure of smoking behavior (Brauer et al., 1996; Herning et al., 
1981; Robinson & Forbes, 1975), will be used to examine whether prolonged use of the 
experimental  cigarettes  affects  topography  measures  that may indicate  smoking  compensation 
(Strasser et al., 2007).  Puff topography will be assessed using a CReSS pocket device that 
provides  a valid measurement  of puff number,  puff volume,  inter-puff interval and  other indices 
(Blank et al., 2009).  Carbon monoxide readings will be collected before and 15 minutes after 
puff topography.  Participants will smoke one cigarette of their usual brand.  
 
Interactive  Voice  Response  System:  
At the end of the first baseline visit, participants will be trained to use the Interactive Voice 
Response (IVR)  System,  which will  contact  participants  each day  throughout  the study  and ask 
about their smoking behavior as well as withdrawal symptoms the week before and after 
Baseline  2. We will also review  the IVR adherence  incentive  program,  which  consists  of $1 per 
call plus a $10 b onus for seven consecutive calls.  Participants will be provided a study cell 
phone if they have unreliable telephone access, do not have enough monthly cell phone 
minutes or prefer not to use their own phone.  
 
The IVR system  is operated  by TeleSage.  To be enrolled  in the IVR system,  research  staff will 
enter the participants initials, telephone number, subject identifier, and visit dates into the IVR 
TCORS website.  Identifying information (initials and telephone numbers) will not be extracted 
with the da ta by the bioinformatics group.  Please refer to TeleSage’s privacy statement and 
HIPAA compliance form for additional information.  
 
Baseline  2 biological  specimens:  
1) Urine  sample  for smoking  biomarker  assessment : 
Participants will be asked to bring a urine sample (first void of the day) to the second 
baseline session for biomarker assessment.  Samples will be stored at temperatures no 
more than -80°C. The tobacco -specific carcinogen  biomarkers are total NNAL and PAH. 
Anatabine and anabasine will be tested in the VLNC condition to validate abstinence or 
measure  the extent  of nicotine  replacement  therapy  being  used.  Total  cotinine  levels  will 
also be assessed to measure daily nicotine exposure.  Participant’s will be reminded  
with a phone call the day before the visit, those who forget will be asked to provide an 
onsite urine sample.  
2) Pulmonary  Marker:  
Fractional Exhaled Nitric Oxide (FeNO) will be assessed as  a measure  of lung  function 
using  the NIOX  VERO,  a hand -held device  for exhaled  NO analysis.  FeNO involves  no 
storing or shipping of specimens, rather, the participant will exhale slowly through the 
device to obtain the result, which will be recorded in the participant’s source.  
61  3) Cardiovascular  Markers:  
Blood samples will be used for measurement of a battery of cardiovascular biomarkers 
primarily focusing on three areas: glucose tolerance (fasting insulin, glucose,  
hemoglobin A1C), clotting markers (thrombin, fibrinogen, PAI -1), inflammatory markers 
(C-reactive protein, interleukin -6, D-Dimer). Secondary measures include: Fasting lipid 
profile (total cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL -C, LDL -C). Participants will be required to 
fast for a minimum  of 8 hours.  Ideally,  participants  will not eat or drink  after m idnight  and 
blood draws will be done in the morning. After the blood draw, participants will be 
provided with a meal voucher so that they may eat  before performing the remaining visit 
tasks.  The following volumes and tubes will be collected: Two 5 mL SST t ubes, one 10 
mL EDTA tube and two 2.7 mL citrate tubes . 
4) Additional  Blood  Samples : 
Blood samples will also be used for assessing individual differences in nicotine 
metabolism  by phenotyping  (i.e., Nicotine  Metabolic  Ratio,  NMR,  which  is phenotypically 
estimated  as the ratio  of 3-hydroxycotinine [3 HC] to  cotinine [COT] in plasma).  One 10 
mL EDTA tube will be collected.  
 
We will store  blood  for the purposes  of analyzing  additional  cardiovascular  biomarkers  or 
genotyping of individual differences in nicotine metabolism (CYP2A6) analyses of 
nicotine metabolism (variation in CYP2A6) or nicotinic acetylcholine receptor gene 
subtypes. All samples will be stored at the University of Vermont Tracy Lab.  
 
Biomarker  shipping  and storage:  
Biomarkers will be shipped quarterly to the University of Vermont Laboratory for Clinical 
Biochemistry Research (Tracy Lab).  The Tracy Lab will serve as a central repository for all 
biomarker  specimens  and will be responsible  for distributing  spec imens  to the appropriate  labs 
on a quarterly  basis.  Urine  samples  will be analyzed  and stored  at the University  of Minnesota 
Hecht Lab.  Cardiovascular Biomarkers will be analyzed and stored at the Tracey Lab.  
Additional  blood  samples  for the purposes  of phenotyping  will be analyzed  and stored  at the 
University of Toronto Tyndale Lab.  
 
Baseline  fMRI  testing  (University  of Vermont  only):  
Participants at the UVM site will complete the neuroimaging battery two or three days after the 
first baselin e assessment,  depending  on availability.  This battery  will be completed only  among 
a randomly selected subset of participants in the lowest and the highest dose conditions (45 
participants/dose condition for total  of 90 participants),  which will  provide the greatest  likelihood 
of detecting differences between nicotine doses.  Forty -five participants from each of the two 
conditions will be selected with the goal of having 20 completers from each of the doses.  
Participants who consent to neuroimaging  and meet the eligibility criteria will be encouraged to 
abstain from smoking for  approximately 24 hours before their scan.  Abstinence will  be verified 
by expired breath carbon monoxide levels that have decreased by at least 50% from the 
measure  taken  during the Baseline  1 visit. The battery  includes  fMRI assessments  that parallel 
the behavioral/cognitive assessments described above (i.e., a sustained attention task, 
inhibitory control test of executive function) and that are sensitive to abstinence -related  
disruptions in performance.  
 
Prior to Baseline scan, participants will partake in a practice session of the fMRI cognitive 
battery  tasks  in a mock  scanner  at the Clinical  Research  Center  (CRC)  in order  to practice  each 
task in an environment that closely mimics that of the actual fMRI machine itself.  
62  The neuroimaging  battery  also includes  a high-resolution anatomical scan to  assess  total and 
regional  grey matter  volumes  and cortical  thickness,  a resting - state scan to assess  intra- and 
inter-regional  brain  connectivity,  and arterial  spin labeling  to provide  a quantitative  measure  of 
blood flow.  Baseline characterization and comparison with a second scan approximately 12 
weeks later will provide the potential for insights into the neurobiology of dependence and 
withdrawal (including individual differences in dependence severity) and differential changes 
that may arise from being exposed for an extended period to VLNC versus usual nicotine 
content levels in commercially available cig arettes.  
 
Experimental  Procedures 
Experimental Period:  
Participants will be seen weekly throughout the 12 -week experimental period.  Weeks 2, 6, 12 
and the abstinence visit will take approximately 2 -4 hours each.  All other sessions will last 
approximately  2 hours.  Upon  arrival  at the laboratory,  participants  will provide urine and breath 
BAL and CO samples.  If the participant has a positive urine toxicology screen the Research 
Assistant  will initiate  the Field  Sobriety  SOP  to determine  if the participant  can continue  with the 
session or if it should be rescheduled. At the end of  each experimental session, the  researcher 
will complete the End of Visit Evaluation Form, which will be filed in the participant’s binder.  
This will allow  the researcher  to make  note of any problems  encountered  during  the visit, to 
track which computers were used for which tasks, and to assess the truthfulness of the 
participant in regards to self -report of tobacco use and compliance to study procedures.  
 
Visit  scheduling  requirements  for experimental  period:  
The ideal scheduling window between each visit is  7 days based on the date of the Baseline 2 
Visit.  For additional scheduling requirements, refer to the ‘ Scheduling Visits SOP ’. If a 
participant misses a vis it and is not able to reschedule during the window (± 3 days), that visit 
will not be ‘made -up’ in the future.  All measures that  were not completed will be considered 
missing  data and will not  be collected during  future visits.  If a visit  mistakenly  occurs outside  of 
the designated  window,  this is a protocol  deviation.  A ‘Non -Medical  Event  Form’  will need  to be 
completed.  Additionally, each visit should occur at approximately the same time of day ± 2 
hours.  
If a participant  is not able to a ttend  his/her  Week  12 visit, then it  should be rescheduled even if  it 
is outside of the scheduling window.  This will be documented as a protocol deviation.

Participants at the UVM site will also complete the neuroimaging battery again to assess 
changes after extended exposure to different doses.  Participants who have initiated a quit 
attempt will not be asked to smoke prior to the scan.  Participants willing to smoke the  research 
cigarettes  will take two puffs  30 minutes  prior to the scan.  If the participant  is unwilling  to smoke 
the research cigarette, they will be allowed to smoke their usual brand.  
 
Biological  Samples  to be collected:  
1) First void urine sample  (Weeks  6 and 12  only)  
2) Blood Samples  (Weeks  6 and  12 only) 
3) Collect  FeNO  (Weeks  6 and 12 only)  
Interactive  Voice  Response  System:  
Participants  will continue  to use the IVR system  on a daily  basis  throughout  the experimental 
period to record the number of study cigarettes smoked per day and use of non -study  
65  cigarettes.  During  the first  week  after Baseline  2, the IVR  system  will collect  information  about 
withdrawal symptoms.  
Variable  Incentive  Program:  
An incentive  program  has been  developed  with the  goal of improving  attendance  at scheduled 
assessment sessions, compliance with using only study -provided tobacco products, and 
encouraging honest self -reports regarding all nicotine/tobacco use.  
 
Briefly, participants will receive a total of five tickets for each weekly visit they attend after 
randomization (Visits 03 -14, weeks 1 -12). In total, participants could earn 60 valid tickets  
across the 12 visits.  Participants will b e instructed that these tickets correspond to attendance 
(one ticket), honest reporting (one ticket), and adherence to using only the assigned study 
product (three tickets).  They will be further instructed that these tickets “could” be eligible for 
entry  into a monthly  drawing  for prizes,  but that only tickets  that are “validated”  will be eligible for 
prizes.  
 
Since it is prohibitively expensive to test urine samples each week for each participant and 
because  it is currently  not feasible  to detect  with reasonable  precision  non-compliance  based  on 
biomarkers in the two higher nicotine group, we plan to only validate the attendance tickets.  
Hence,  each  participant  who attends  their regularly  scheduled  weekly  session  will have  a total 
of five validated tick ets entered into the monthly drawing.  
 
To convey the message that we may be validating honest  reporting and use of only study - 
provided products, we will collect a weekly urine specimen from participants.  Further, in a 
bogus pipeline of sorts, participants will be instructed and that these urine specimens MAY be 
used to biochemically verify compli ance to the study product by testing different nicotine and 
tobacco products found in the urine.  Likewise, participants will also be instructed that their 
honesty  ticket  MAY  be validated  if their self-reported  tobacco  use matches  what’s in  their urine. 
So there is some minor deception involved, but technically we could conduct urine toxicology 
testing  for both purposes.  Hence,  if the urine toxicology testing  is presented  as something  that 
MAY be done for validation purposes, we feel that any deception is relatively minor.  For 
scientific/economic reasons we are just electing to restrict validation to attendance.  
Nevertheless, we will debrief all participants upon the completion of the trial.  We will inform 
them  that the incentive  program  was based exclusively  on attendance  due to the relatively  high 
cost of urine toxicology  testing  and other  practical  problems  with shipping  the urines  for prompt 
testing.  
 
Drawings will  be conducted on the 1st of each month.  Validation will  be performed by staff who 
have  no participant  interaction  and are not blind  to condition.  Any ticket  drawn  will be eligible  for 
an incentive as the only true contingency is for attendance.  There will be no mention of the 
basis for earning incentives (i.e., whether the ticket was for attendance, honesty, adherence,).  
Participants  will simply  be informed  that he or she earned  an incentive  from the drawing.  
 
Each  drawing  will be independent  (without  replacement);  consequently,  some  participants  will 
not win a prize and others may win  more than one during the study if more than one of their 
tickets is drawn. After confirming winners, the remaining tickets from each month will be 
discarded (i.e.,  tickets  will only  be entered into  one drawing).  The monthly  prize  amounts  are 
detailed belo w. 
 
We estimate  based  on the 2½ years  we estimate  it will take to complete  this study,  that 
66  participants  will win an average  of approximately  $65 in prizes  or an additional  $5.50  per week 
per participant.  
 
Grand Prize (1): $500 cash 
Second  Prize  (1): $200  cash 
Third Prize (5): $10 cash  
Product  and Procedures  Compliance  Review  Sessions:  
At each  visit, Baseline  2 through  Week  11, participants  will be counseled  about  their use of the 
study cigarettes.  Participants will be asked about any concerns or obstacles associated with 
use of the study cigarettes.  The importance of honest self -reporting will be stressed.  
Participants will be told that they will not be penalized for use of other nicotine or tobacco 
products and that it is crucial for them to report any use of these products.  If difficulties are 
encountered, participants will be asked why they think they are experiencing difficulties (e.g., 
taste, withdrawal symptoms) and to proble m-solve how to deal with these difficulties in order to 
meet the protocol requirements.  Additionally, participants will be counseled about their IVR 
completion,  visit attendance,  task engagement  and product  accountability.  Refer to the ‘ Product 
and Procedu res Compliance Review Sessions SOP ’ for more information.  
Quit Attempts  During  the Study  Protocol:  
At each weekly session, we will ask the participant if he/she is currently abstaining from 
smoking  with the intention  of quitting.  If the answer  is no, then we will also ask if he/she  is 
planning to quit smoking prior to his/her next scheduled visit.  
If a Participant  is Currently  Abstaining  from  Smoking  with the Intention  to Quit:  
 
• Encourage  participant  to continue  abstaining  from smoking  
• Schedule  the participant  for normal  weekly  visits,  but no puff topography  
• Provide  the participant  with the ‘Clearing  the Air’ manual  and local smoking  cessation  
resources  
• Give the participant  the option  to take home  study  product  rather  than require  him/her  to 
take the product  
• If the participant choses to take home the study product have him/her sign a form 
acknowledging that cigarette availability could be detrimental to the quit attempt. 
Recommend  that he/she  put the product  “away”  at home  as to avoid  unwanted  cues  to 
smoke.  
• If the participant  chooses  not to take home  the study  product,  have  him/her  contact  the 
lab if he/she lapses and would like to pick up or be mailed the study product prior to 
his/her next visit.  
 
If a Participant  is Planning  to Quit Smoking,  but has not initiated  the quit  attempt:  
 
• Ask if he/she  has identified a  target  quit date and,  if so, what  that target  date is. 
• Provide  the participant  with the ‘Clearing  the Air’ manual  and local smoking  cessation  
resources.  
• Provide  the participant  with the  study  product  as usual.  Recommend that  on the target  
date he/she put  the product  “away”  at home as  to avoid  unwanted cues  to smoke.  
67  Abstinence  Assessment  Session:  
After the week 12 visit, participants will be required to come back for one additional visit the 
following  day. During  this visit,  participants will have  been encouraged to  abstain from smoking 
until their next scheduled visit (approximately 24 hours later).  The abstinence assessment 
session should be  scheduled no less than 18 hours  and no more than 30 hours after the Week 
12 visit.  Abstinence will be verified by expired breath carbon monoxide levels that have 
decreased to < 4 ppm.  This session will allow us to determine whether the experimental 
cigare ttes have reduced the effects of abstinence on these measures relative to the control 
conditions.  If the participant  does  NOT  meet  abstinence criteria,  he/she will  only receive  $20 for 
the visit.

Participant  Compensation:  
Participants will receive $25 for completing the screening visit, plus an additional $25 bonus for 
completing the visit on time as scheduled.  Payment will be made regardless of enrollment as 
long as the participant passes the drug test, breath alcohol test , and meets the minimum 
requirements for carbon monoxide or NicAlert levels.  Participants who do not pass these tests 
will be dismissed  from the screening  visit without  payment, except  in the event  they can produce 
a prescription for the medication that caused them to fail the drug test.  Participants will receive  
$100 for each of the shorter sessions (Baseline 1, Weeks 1, 2,  3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11),  $150 for 
each of the longer sessions (Baseline 2, Weeks 6 &12), up to $160 for the abstin ence visit 
($150 for the visit + up to $10 for the preference test), $20 for biochemical verification of 
abstinence,  up to $221  for completing  daily IVR reports  of study  cigarette  and other  nicotine  and 
tobacco use.  Participants will also have a chance to earn an additional $50 bonus for every 
three visits that are completed on time as scheduled.  There will also be a $100 bonus for 
completing the study for a total bonus of $325.  If the participant does not  attend the screening 
visit or one of the weekly vis its as scheduled, they will forfeit the bonus.  They will have a 
chance to  earn another  bonus  payment  with the  next set of three visits.  Participants  who do not 
complete the entire study will receive compensation for the sessions that they do complete.  
UVM participants who undergo fMRI testing will receive an additional $150/scan.  Total 
compensation for completing Study 2, including study visit payments, daily IVR calls and 
bonuses is $2301 (or $2601 if  participating in the fMRI testing). Parti cipants will also have a 
chance  to earn additional  money  through  the Variable  Incentive  program.  As mentioned  above, 
participants will have a chance to earn additional incentives each month for compliance, 
honesty and attendance, however, we anticipate tha t on average, participants will win 
approximately $150 in prizes.  
69  End of Study:  
After  a participant  has completed  all study  procedures  and has been  paid for participation  the 
research assistant will read the following script and give the participant the Clearing the Air 
Manual.  
“If you’ve reduced your smoking during this study, we encourage you to continue these 
reductions  or even  consider  quitting.  We would  like to provide  you with some  resources  should 
you decide to try to abstain from smoking (give “Clearing the Air” and hotline  
information).  Please also feel free to consult with your physician and use any medications 
he/she deems appropriate.  We will call you in approxim ately 30 days to ask about your 
smoking since leaving the study.  There is  no right  answer and we know  how difficult  quitting 
can be. Please  just answer  honestly.  The call will take less than 5 minutes.  Thanks  again  for 
your participation.”  
The following  assessments will  be administered  using  REDCap:  
 
1) End of Study  Questionnaire  
 
30 Day Follow  up Phone  Call: 
Participants will receive a follow -up phone call between 25 and 35 days after the abstinence 
assessment session to assess their smoking patterns.  The phone questionnaire will last less 
than five minutes.  The questionnaire will ask if the participant is still smoking, how much and 
whether he/she has attempted to quit smoking since the end of the study.  Participants will 
receive 5 va riable incentive program lottery tickets for completing the call as compensation. 
Those who report abstinence will be invited to come in for biochemical verification and be 
compensated $40 for doing so.  A urine sample will be collected to test urine cotini ne levels. 
Additionally,  any Medical  Event  Forms  that remain  open  from the last session  will be discussed. 
If the participant became pregnant during the study, this would have been recorded as a 
medical event.  During this phone call, the research assistant  will confirm her due date.  This 
event will remain  open  until delivery.  At that time the licensed medical professional will contact 
the participant  to ask a few questions  about  the baby’s  health  and will update  the Medical  Event 
Form.  
 
Once  a participant  has completed  all study  procedures  and all open  events  have  been  closed, 
the PI will review the participant’s binder and sign a form indicating study completion for that 
participant.  
 
Randomization  
At the end  of the Baseline 1 session,  particip ants will be randomized into one of  three cigarette 
conditions.  Participants in each condition will be assigned cigarettes that match their menthol 
preference. Participants will be randomized, using block randomization, in equal  number to the 
dose conditio ns, with randomization stratified by study site and menthol status. Each site will 
randomize participants until the total goal of 282 participants across both sites is reached, and 
no effort  will be made to recruit  a specific  number  of menthol  and non -ment hol smokers  at each 
site.

The lead statistician  will create  a randomization  schedule  for each  of the two sites,  amounting  to 
150% of expected enrollment at each site.  The excess randomization codes will be used in the 
event that  a site will have to enroll extra participants due to unexpectedly slow enrollment  at 
another site.  The nicotine doses will be identified  by letter code  and the  number 2 (V2,  W2, X2, 
Y2) and only Administrative Core personnel with no participant contact wi ll have the link 
between the statistician’s  letter code and dose assignments.  The randomization schedules  and 
the link between the alphabetic code and treatment assignment will be maintained securely by 
the Administrative Core.  A second, sealed, copy will be secured in a separate building to 
protect against loss related to fire or other unforeseen events.  
The University of Vermont will be responsible for removing all identifying information from 
cigarettes  received  from the Research  Triangle  Institute  (RTI) , labeling  each  carton  with a blind 
code, assigning product using this blind code based on the randomization schedule being 
provided by the UVM Biostatistics Core, and shipping cigarettes to each site as needed based 
on recruitment.  Each site will be respo nsible for tracking product received and distributed to 
participants, collecting unused product from participants, and returning unused cigarettes to  
71  UVM.  The participants,  investigators  and study  staff will not have knowledge of  which  product  is 
given to a participant or whether different participants received the same or different product.  
During the experimental period, participants will be provided with a 14 -day supply of research 
cigarettes equivalent to 150% of their daily smoking rate. This rate will be calculated at 
Baseline 2 and will be an average daily smoking rate based on the IVR data for the first seven 
days  of the baseline  period.  This will ensure  adequate  availability  of cigarettes  in the numerous 
locations participants ma y typically keep a supply (home, work, vehicle, etc.) as well as avoid 
expending  the entire supply if  they miss a scheduled  visit. Participants will be instructed to use 
the research cigarettes for 12 weeks, at which point they are to discontinue product u se. 
If there  is prior knowledge  a participant  will be missing  a visit (i.e. planned  vacation,  laboratory 
closure, etc.), then the participant will be provided with an adequate supply of cigarettes to 
make up for the missed visit(s).  The participant will be given a 21 -day supply if one visit is 
going to be missed and a 28 -day supply if two visits are going to be missed.  
Participants will be asked to refrain from use of other non -study cigarettes during the study 
period. If participants hav e to use another nicotine product, they will be told to use a non - 
combustible product (gum, patch, etc.).  Additionally, they will be told there is not a penalty for 
use of non -study cigarettes, and that it is crucial for them to report any use of non -study 
cigarettes or other nicotine or tobacco products.  Throughout the baseline and experimental 
periods, an Interactive Voice Response (IVR) system will be used on a daily basis to record the 
number  of study  cigarettes  and non -study  cigarettes  used the previo us day. During  the baseline 
and first experimental week, participants will also answer daily IVR questions about their mood. 
Participants will be seen weekly for assessments.  Brief standardized review sessions focusing 
on compliance with the study cigarett es and other study procedures will be provided at each 
visit. At the end of the 12 -week trial, participants will undergo an assessment of withdrawal, 
craving, and cognitive function following a brief period of abstinence.  
 
Product  Accountability:  
Participa nts will be required  to keep  track  of all the cigarettes  provided  to them.  Therefore,  they 
will be instructed to return all unused cigarettes and empty cigarette packs to the laboratory 
each week.  Research staff will complete the ‘Product Accountability Log’ with the participants. 
Any discrepancies in the product dispensed versus product re turned will be discussed and 
recorded in the log.  Empty  cigarette packs  will not be saved.  Unused cigarette packs  will be re - 
distributed to the participants during Weeks 1 -11. During Week 12, any remaining unused 
cigarettes returned by the participants wi ll be collected by the research staff.  
 
Participants  who report  running  out of cigarettes  prior to a scheduled weekly  visit will be allowed 
to come in for  an unscheduled visit  to obtain  more research cigarettes.  If a participant  has more 
than two unanticip ated visits  we will  determine if  a rate change is  necessary.  To determine this, 
we will look  at the past two CO levels as compared to the Baseline 2 CO.  If the CO trend is 
consistent  with the self-report  of smoking  all of the allotted  cigarettes  then a rate increase  will be 
granted.  The participant will then receive cigarettes at a rate of 175% of their daily smoking 
rate. The maximum increase is  200% of their daily smoking  rate. If participants lose more than 
two packs of cigarettes and require an unsch eduled visit to the laboratory to supplement their  
72  supply,  they will be told the next time they lose more  than two packs  they will have  to wait until 
their next scheduled appointment to receive more cigarettes.  
Statistical  Methods  and Sample  Size 
Statistical  methods . See Statistical  Analysis Plan  at the end of this Supplemental  document.  
 
Sample size. Sample size for other analyses was determined using power analysis for 
hypothesis tests related to the Primary Aim of Study 2, specifical ly to detect a significant 
difference between the reduced -nicotine conditions and the high -nicotine yield condition in the 
primary  endpoints,  cigarettes  per day (CPD)  and urine cotinine,  at the end of  the trial.  Donny  et 
al. (2015) found a reduction of  4.52 CPD and  6.07 CPD among  subjects smoking  0.12 mg/g  
and 0.03 mg machine estimated nicotine delivery per cigarette , respectively, compared to those 
smoking normal nicotine cigarettes.  In addition, they reported a decrease of 0.59 and 0.39 in 
urine cotinine among those smoking these same RNC cigarettes, compared to those smoking 
NNC cigarettes.  A sample size of  69 completers per condition will provide 90% power to detect 
similar differences in CPD and greater than 95% power to detect differences in u rine cotinine, 
with a two -sided type I error rates of  0.02.  The type I error rate reflects the Bonferroni 
correction needed to allow testing of all pair -wise comparisons.  Regarding fMRI power, the 
analysis was based on the estimated effect size of 2.04 (Co hen's d) from the cortical activation 
differences previously observed between  smokers  and ex-smokers  on the same  inhibitory  
control  task proposed  here (Nestor  et al., 2011).  With 20 completers in each condition, there is  
80% power at p = 0.05 to detect eff ects about half as large (Cohen d=0.91) between any two 
conditions.  
 
Potential  Risks of Participation  
1) Survey  Questionnaires : The interview  will include  questions  about  medical  history,  drug 
and alcohol  use, and questionnaires  about  mood.  Answering  these personal  questions 
could make the participant feel uncomfortable.  
2) Breach  of Confidentiality : The risk of the interview  is loss of privacy  if other  people  find 
out the results.  
3) Coercion : Coercion  is a possible  risk due to monetary  compensation  for participating  in 
these studies.  The likelihood of this risk is low because the compensation is 
commensurate with the amount of time and effort required for these studies.  
4) Drug  Testing : A breach of  confidentiality  could  occur  and other  peop le could learn of  the 
participant’s  drug use. 
5) Obtaining blood pressure : The blood pressure cuff may cause minimal discomfort.  In 
obtaining  blood  pressure,  researchers  may find out the participant  has abnormal  blood 
pressure.  
6) Smoking  Cigarettes : All cigarettes  are detrimental  to a person’s  health  and can lead to 
significant  medical  problems  including:  
g. Cardiovascular Diseases: Coronary heart disease, heart attack, stroke, 
peripheral  vascular  disease,  reduced  blood  circulation,  abdominal  aortic 
aneurysm  
h. Respiratory  Diseases:  Emphysema,  bronchitis,  and chronic  airway  obstruction  
i. Cancers:  Cancer  of the lung,  bladder,  cervix,  esophagus,  kidney,  larynx,  mouth, 
pancreas, throat, and stomach; leukemia  
j. Metabolic  Diseases:  Type  2 Diabetes  
73  k. Other Health Risks Associated with Smoking: Including but not limited to 
infertility,  lower  bone  density  in postmenopausal  women,  and hip fracture  in 
women  
l. Death  
7) Smoking study cigarettes : In addition to the above medical problems, participants may 
experien ce some minor adverse health effects such as headaches or experience 
withdrawal symptoms, which are listed below.  Due to the altered nicotine levels, there 
could be a change in their cigarette use including the manner in which they inhale the 
smoke.  Smokin g the study cigarettes does not provide any less risk than their usual 
brand  cigarette  and could  pose  increased  health  risks.  Participants  may also experience 
increases in levels of carbon monoxide, a gas from smoke.  
8) Smoking  Withdrawal : Participants  may experience  smoking  withdrawal  symptoms  during 
this study.  The symptoms can be uncomfortable but are typically of minimal risk. 
Smoking withdrawal symptoms include:  
a. Anger,  irritability,  frustration  
b. Anxiousness,  nervousness  
c. Depressed  mood  or sadness  
d. Desire  or craving  to smoke  
e. Difficulty  concentrating  
f. Increased  appetite,  hunger  or weight  gain 
g. Insomnia,  problems  sleeping  or awakening  at night 
h. Restlessness  
i. Impatience  
j. Constipation  
k. Dizziness  
l. Coughing  
m. Dreaming  or nightmares  
n. Nausea  
o. Sore Throat  
9) Returning to Regular Smoking:  It is possible that if participants return to smoking their 
usual  brand  of cigarette  at the end of the study  they may experience  mild and transient 
nausea, dizziness, and lightheadedness.  
10) Risk to Fetus : Smoking during pregnancy can lead to miscarriage, preterm delivery, 
stillbirth,  low birth weight,  problems  with the placenta,  birth defects  such  as cleft palate, 
sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), and early childhood behavioral problems.  
11) Changes in blood  pressure and/or heart rate : Smoking and nicotine can affect the 
cardiovascular  system,  which  may result  in changes  in blood  pressure  and/or  heart  rate. 
12) Exacerbation of  psychiatric  symptoms : Smoking  and nicotine can affect  a person’s  mood 
and emotions and are associated with psychiatric disorders including major depressive 
disorder, general anxiety disorder, bipolar disorder and eating disorders.  Any changes 
in nicotine or cigarettes consumption could adversely affect psychiatric condi tions.  
13) MRI: The MRI scanner produces a loud banging noise and may be uncomfortable for 
people who become anxious in confined spaces.  The presence of metal in or on a 
participant’s  body during  an MRI scan can present a  serious health risk.  The MRI staff 
will ask participants in detail about any possible metal they may have in or on them. 
Regarding  unexpected  MRI findings,  the participant  will be informed  of what  was found. 
In addition, information about the incidental finding can be provided to the participa nt’s 
primary  doctor  or the study  team  can refer them  to an appropriate specialist.  The costs  
74  for any care that would  be needed  to diagnose  or treat an incidental  finding  would  not be 
covered by the research study and would be the responsibility of the participant.  
Avoiding  Risks  to Fetus:  
If participants choose to be sexually active, they should use an appropriate “double barrier” 
method  of birth control  (such  as female  use of a diaphragm,  or contraceptive sponge,  in addition 
to ma le use of a condom) or the female should be using prescribed “birth control” pills, patch, 
ring, injections, or implants or intrauterine device (IUD).  Participants will be tested for  
pregnancy every two weeks beginning at screening through the last study v isit. If a participant 
becomes pregnant during the study, she will be withdrawn from the study.  Approximately 30 
days after being withdrawn or having a positive pregnancy test at the last study visit, the 
research  staff will call the participant  to confirm  her due date.  The licensed  medical  professional 
will follow -up with the participant after delivery to ask questions about the baby’s health.  
Expected  benefits  of participation:  
There  are no immediate  benefits  from participating  in the study.  The information  obtained  from 
this study may ultimately help the Food and Drug Administration decide how best to regulate 
tobacco products with the goal of improving public health.  
 
Study  Debriefing:  
After  data collection  is complete,  participants  will receive  a letter  telling  them  which  condition 
they were randomized into and the results of the study thus far.  
 
Protection  Against  Risk 
Research data without identifiers will be maintained in a locked file cabinet and on password - 
protected computers in th e research staff workplace, with only code numbers identifying 
subjects.  Study consent forms and the linkage between the participants’ names and codes will 
be stored  in a locked  file cabinet.  Interviews  with participants  will be conducted  in private  rooms.  
Urine samples for drug and pregnancy tests and tobacco exposure biomarkers will be obtained 
in a private bathroom within the laboratory suite. Blood draws will be performed in a private 
patient room.  Subjective measures will be administered electronically . The biostatistics and 
data-management team will provide consistent data -management practices for all data in the 
Center.  Validity and reliability of data will  be maximized by  using REDCap, which is housed on 
the Fletcher Allen Health Care, HIPAA complian t, computing system.  REDCap is a secure, 
web-based system that accommodates local and remote data collection by each project team, 
and allows for data entry work -flow monitoring and data quality control monitoring by biometry 
staff.  For data integrity, dat a entry windows will follow the structure of paper forms as much as 
possible to allow for ease of entry, and will use predefined choices to minimize errors when 
possible.  Data quality monitoring will be facilitated with periodic  down loads  and analysis using 
a variety of common statistical program format such as SAS, Stata, R, and SPSS.  Quality 
control procedures will be conducted for all data collected, including analysis of missing data 
and logic checks for out of range and other anomalou s values.  This secure electronic data 
gathering and transmission plan, overseen by the experienced biostatistical team, will minimize 
opportunities for breaches of confidentiality.  Biological samples for nicotine and carcinogen 
biomarker analysis will be m arked with participant ID, stored in the locked laboratory suite, and 
sent to a laboratory for analysis on a quarterly basis.  
75  All information collected as part of this study will be accessible only to research staff.  No 
information will be sh ared with participants’ clinicians unless the participant requests this in 
writing.  All investigators and staff have undergone (and any new staff will undergo) human 
subjects’ ethics training as required by UVM and are fully conversant with relevant ethica l 
principals  around  confidentiality.  Assessments,  consenting  and study  procedures  will be closely 
supervised by the PI.  
 
The sponsors (NIDA/FDA) as well as the Institutional Review Board and regulatory authorities 
could  be granted  direct  access  to original  medical  and research  records  for verification  of clinical 
trial procedures and/or data.  If this is required, it will be done under conditions that will protect 
privacy to the fullest extent possible consistent with laws relating to public disclosure of 
information and the law -enforcement responsibilities of the agency.  
Data  Storage:  
Data will be stored locally at each site, at the University of Minnesota Masonic Cancer Center’s 
Bioinformatics  Core and  at the University  of Vermont.  Long -term storage of  all study  data,  for at 
least 7 years after study completion, will be at the University of Vermont.  
 
Adverse  Events  
The research assistant will ask about adverse events at each session, using a form that 
assesses the nature, severity, duration, action taken, and outcome of study -related adverse 
events.  AEs will be captured from the time of first study cigarette. Participants will be given 
contact cards to inform us of events that occur between study contacts.  Any AE that remains 
open will be reviewed an d closed at an interview conducted 30 days after the study completion 
date (completers)  or when  the study  should  have  ended had  the participant  completed  the study 
(dropouts and those withdrawn by investigator).  
All procedures will be monitored to ensure that they conform to the approved protocol.  In 
addition, monitoring will be done of all unforeseen circumstances that might arise and affect 
safety; of all reports of serious adverse events as defined in 38 CFR 46 (death, new or 
prolonged hospitaliz ation, persistent or significant disability/incapacity); of other significant 
adverse events (adverse events that lead to drop out by the participant or termination by the 
investigator);  of unexpected  adverse  events  resulting  from the study,  and of expecte d adverse 
events.  
 
Any SAE will be brought to the attention of the site PIs as soon as possible and not longer than 
24 hours.  Any AE or SAE that is both unexpected and related to study participation will be 
reported to the IRB within 7 days of the event.  The local IRB will make a determination as to 
whether additional reporting requirements are needed.  IRB actions will be reported to the 
funding agency by the PIs no less than annually and more frequently as recommended by the 
local IRB.  Any SAEs will be sum marized in the yearly Progress Reports to the funding agency, 
including a review of frequency and severity.  All SAEs will be followed through ongoing 
consultation with the physician caring for the patient until they resolve, result in death, or 
stabilize a nd are not expected to improve.  The study staff will be in close contact with 
participants  and health  care providers  throughout  the study  to monitor  for potential  unanticipated  
76  problems.  Any unanticipated  problems  will be discussed  at the weekly  research  staff meetings 
and reported as required to the local IRB.  
Withdrawal  or Monitoring  of Participants  
For the participant’s  protection,  participants  will be withdrawn  immediately  from  the 
study if any of the following occur:  
1) Cardiovascular dis ease (CVD) event : Typically include s MI (heart attack), PTCA 
(angioplasty/stenting), bypass surgery, stroke, peripheral vascular disease (arterial 
blockages in arms or legs leading to procedure or surgery).  Less common CVD 
problems  would  be new cardiac  arrhythmias  (e.g.,  new atrial  fibrillation)  or new valvular 
disease (e.g., mitral or aortic regurgitation).  
2) DVT/PE  (deep  vein thrombosis/pulmonary  embolism,  i.e., blood  clots in the venous 
system).  
3) Suicide Attempt : A participant  will be withdrawn i f he/she  attempts  suicide  at any time 
during participation in the study.  
4) Psychiatric  Hospitalization : A participant  will be withdrawn  if he/she  is hospitalized  for 
psychiatric reasons at any time during participation in the study.  
5) Pregnancy : If participant indicates she is pregnant or has a positive pregnancy test at 
any time during the study, she will be withdrawn from the study, and this event will 
remain open  until delivery.  At that time the licensed  medical  professional  will contact  the 
participant to ask a few questions about the baby’s health and will update the open 
‘Medical Event Form’.  A positive pregnancy test at  Session  14 in Study 1  or Week  12 in 
Study 2 will trigger a ‘Medical Event Form’ to be completed but will not result in 
withdra wal since she is no longer receiving study product.  
6) Expired  breath  carbon  monoxide  increase : A participant  will be withdrawn  from the study 
if the average of two consecutive CO readings during the same visit is 100 ppm or 
greater.  
7) Marked  increase  in smoking : A participant  will be withdrawn  from the study  if he/she 
meets BOTH of the following criteria for two consecutive weeks  
a. Cigarette  per day increase:  The average  CPD  increases  by more  than 100% 
from the average CPD during baseline.  
b. Expired  breath  carbon  monoxide  increase:  If the average  of two consecutive  CO 
measurements in the same visit is  
i. CO is greater  than 50 ppm if CO at Baseline  1 is <20 ppm.  
ii. CO is greater than  60 ppm if  CO at Baseline  1 is 20 – 34 ppm.  
iii. CO is greater than  70 ppm if  CO at Baseline  1 is 35 – 49 ppm.  
iv. CO is greater  than 80 ppm if  CO at Baseline  1 is 50 – 64 ppm.  
v. CO is greater than  90 ppm if  CO at Baseline  1 is 65 – 80 ppm.  
8) Note:  If the second  consecutive  visit is the last study  visit, then the participant  would  not 
be withdrawn from the study.  
 
The following  will be monitored  and can lead to the participant  being  withdrawn  by the PI 
or Licensed Medical Professional:  
1) Cigarettes per day increase : Continued participation will be evaluated by the site PI if 
the average  number  of cigarettes  per day (CPD)  increases  by more than  100%  from the 
average CPD during baseline as determined by CPD at Baseline 2.  
77  2) Blood pressure (BP) or heart rate (HR) changes : If any of the following occur post - 
enrollment: 1) BP is at or above 160/100 or below 90/50, or 2) HR is at or above 115 
bpm o r below 45 bpm a manual blood pressure and heart rate measurement will be 
taken  after 10 minutes  have  passed.  If the manual  reading  is still out of range,  a ‘Blood 
Pressure and Heart Rate Symptom Checklist’ and ‘Medical Event Form’ will be 
completed, and t he participant will be monitored by the medical professional.  
3) Expired breath Carbon Monoxide increase : If the average of two consecutive CO 
measurements  meets  the criteria  below  then the ‘Medical  Event  Form’  will be completed 
and the participant will be mo nitored by the licensed medical professional.  
a. CO is greater  than 50 ppm if CO at Baseline  1 is <20 ppm.  
b. CO is greater than  60 ppm if  CO at Baseline  1 is 20 – 34 ppm.  
c. CO is greater than  70 ppm if  CO at Baseline  1 is 35 – 49 ppm.  
d. CO is greater  than 80 ppm if CO at Baseline  1 is 50 – 64 ppm.  
e. CO is greater than  90 ppm if  CO at Baseline  1 is 65 – 80 ppm.  
4) Any hospitalization or debilitation in which participation in the study could be detrimental 
to the recovery  process.  This will be self-reported  by the participant  and will be reviewed 
by the site PI and licensed medical professional to determine whether continued 
participation in the study is appropriate.  
5) If a participant is behaving in an inappropriate or threatening manner, admits to lying 
about eligib ility criteria, is participating in other smoking research studies that could 
affect  the primary  outcome  measures,  etc., then the PI can withdraw  him/her  from the 
study at the PI’s discretion.  
6) If a participant  fails to attend  regularly  scheduled  research a ssessment  visits  or comply 
with the research procedures or schedule, then the PI can withdraw him/her from the 
study at the PI’s discretion.  
7) Increase in psychiatric symptoms:  Exacerbation in symptoms noted during the study 
(i.e., change in BDI category fro m mild to moderate or moderate to severe) will trigger 
review  by the study’s  licensed  medical  professional.  The PI will withdraw  the participant 
upon the licensed medical professional’s recommendation.  
 
Data  Safety  Monitoring  Board  
A Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) has been established to monitor safety outcomes 
and will  be comprised of  five members.  The DSMB  will be chaired  by Dr. Eden Evins,  Associate 
Professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and Director of the Cen ter for Addiction 
Medicine at Massachusetts General Hospital. Other members include: Kevin Delucchi, PhD., 
Professor in Residence of Biostatistics in Psychiatry at the University of California San 
Francisco and Director of the Quantitative Core of the San Francisco Treatment Research 
Center;  Hendree E.  Jones,  Ph.D.,  Professor of  Obstetrics  and Gynecology  and Director of  UNC 
Horizons at University of North Carolina Chapel Hill; Wallace Pickworth, Ph.D., Research 
Leader, Baltimore Operation, Centers for Publi c Health Research and Evaluation, Battelle; 
Kimber  Richter,  Ph.D.,  M.P.H.,  Associate  Professor  of Preventive  Medicine  and Public  Health  at 
the University of Kansas and Director of the University of Kansas Hospital’s tobacco treatment 
program.  
 
Conflict  of interest  
None  of the members  will be otherwise  affiliated  with the center  and each  member  will complete 
a conflict of interest disclosur e form  prior to  each meeting.  Ad hoc specialists may  be invited to 
participate as non -voting members at any time if additional expertise is desired.  
78  Monitoring  activities  and frequency  of meetings  
The DSMB will set their own agenda and decisions about monitoring; e.g. how frequently to 
monitor,  what  threshold  requires  changes  to protocol  or stopping  the study,  and whether  to view 
raw or analyzed data.  The DSMB will be given FDA and EMEA guidelines for DSMBs and 
recent reviews on DSMBs.  A brief report will be generated from each meeting for the study 
record and forwarded to each of the study site’s Institutional Review Boards (IRB) and NIDA’s 
Program  Officer  with the progress  report.  The DSMB  will be available  to convene  outside  of the 
regular meetings, if necessary.  If concerns should arise regarding a particular subject, or any 
troublesome trends in the experiences of participants, they will make appropriate 
recommendations  for changes  in protocol,  as needed.  The project  investigators  will continue to 
examine safety data, blind to study condition, in case they wish to make study  
modifications.  Before  modifications  are made,  they will inform  the DSMB  and request  their 
comments.  
 
Communication  plan to IRB, NIDA,  and FDA (if applicable)  
All IRBs,  the FDA and the NIDA’s  Program  Officer  will be informed  of any significant  action 
taken as a result of the Data and Monitoring Board’s findings.  Study Participants will be 
informed of any c hanges in risk.  
 
Protection  of confidentiality  
For DSMB  meetings  only de-identified  data,  including  blinded  study  site and condition  type,  will 
be provided to the board.  All data and discussion during the meeting will be confidential.  
 
Investigational  Tobacco Product  
The Vermont Center on Tobacco and Regulatory Science has received an Investigational 
Tobacco  Product  (ITP)  application  from the FDA to cover  the experimental  cigarettes  being 
used in this study.  This application encompasses both trial sites.  
 
Certificate  of Confidentiality  
To help  protect  the participant’s  privacy,  Dr. Stephen  Higgins,  PhD,  has received  a Certificate  of 
Confidentiality from the National Institutes of Health.  With this certificate, the researchers 
cannot be forced to disclose information that may identify the participants, even by a court 
subpoena, in any federal, state, or local civil, criminal, administrative, legislative, or other 
proceedings.  The researchers  will use the Certificate to resist  any demands  for information that 
would identify the participants, except as explained below.  The Certificate cannot be used to 
resist  a demand  for information  from personnel  of the United  States  Government  that is used  for 
auditing or evaluation of federally funded pr ojects or for information that must be disclosed in 
order to meet the requirements of the Federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  
The Certificate of Confidentiality does not prevent the participant or a member of their family 
from voluntarily  releasing  information  about  themself  and their involvement  in the research.  If 
an insurer, employer or other person obtains the participant’s written consent to receive 
research information, then the researcher may not use the Certificate to wi thhold that 
information.  
The Certificate  of Confidentiality  does  not prevent  the researchers  from disclosing  voluntarily, 
without consent, information that would identify the individual  as a participant of the  research  
79  project  in instances  such as evidence  of child abuse  or a participant's  threatened  violence  to 
self or others.

89  Protocol 
Objective : 
The primary  overall  objective  of these  studies  is to evaluate  the effects  of extended  exposure  to 
cigarettes differing in nicotine content in socioeconomically disadvantaged ( < high school 
educational  attainment) women of  childbearing  age using  a 3-condition,  parallel  groups  design. 
After a baseline period in which daily smoking rate and other baseline assessments are 
completed, participants will  be randomly assigned to one of t hree cigarette conditions (nicotine 
content:  0.03, 0.12, and 0.8 mg  machine estimated nicotine  delivery per cigarette ) for the  12-
week experimental period.  
 
Background Information:  
The 2009 Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act (FSPTCA) gives the Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA) regulatory authority over tobacco products, including nicotine levels 
in cigarettes.  That is an exciting development as it creates the opportunity to examine the 
Benowitz and Henningfield (1994) hypothesis that smoking prevalence, nicotine dependence, 
and smoking -related morbidity and mortality can be lowered substantially by reducing the 
nicotine content  of cigarettes  to non -addictive levels.  Computer  modeling  predicts  that reducing 
nicotine levels in cigarettes  would produce substantial improvements in population health 
(Tengs et al., 2005).  An essential initial step towards the implementation of such a policy is to 
thoroughly investigate its safety and potential unintended adverse consequences.  Indeed, the 
FDA’ s Center for Tobacco Products seeks to establish research centers to assist with the 
mission of investigating such regulatory matters related to the FSPTCA (see RFA -DA-13-003). 
The FDA explicitly notes that researching tobacco regulatory questions in vulne rable 
populations is a crosscutting agency priority, listing women of childbearing age (15 -44) and 
pregnant women among the vulnerable populations of interest.  
 
Approximately 23% of U.S. women of childbearing age (15 -44 years) are current cigarette 
smokers  (CDC, 2011). However, smoking is overrepresented among socioeconomically 
disadvantaged women,  especially  those with less  education.  For example,  smoking  prevalence 
rates are 43% and 36% among women with < 12 yrs or a high school education, compared to 
28% and 16% among those with some college and undergraduate degrees (SAMHSA, 2010).  
Prevalence of  nicotine dependence similarly  varies  by educational  attainment, with rates  among 
smokers being 63%, 57%, 44%, and 27% among women with < 12 yrs, high school, som e 
college, and undergraduate degrees (SAMHSA, 2010).  Of particular potential relevance to the 
topic of this  application, preference for  high nicotine yield (i.e., “full -flavor” brand) cigarettes  also 
varies by educational attainment, with 64%, 49%, 35%, an d 14% of women in these same 
educational categories endorsing that preference. Overall, these data underscore a robust and 
pervasive inverse association between educational attainment and smoking among women of 
childbearing  age. In this application,  we will focus  on women  who have < 12 years  of education, 
as this subgroup has the highest prevalence of smoking, nicotine dependence, and preference 
for cigarette brands with the highest nicotine yield (Kandel et al., 2009; SAMHSA, 2010).  
 
Special  Health  Risk s of Smoking  Among  Women  
In addition to the adverse health consequences of smoking that cross genders, smoking also 
has adverse consequences specific to women’s reproductive health.  Women who smoke have 
an increased  risk of cardiovascular  disease,  but wome n who smoke  and use oral contraceptives  
90  have a dose -dependent higher risk of heart attacks and strokes (WHO, 1997, 2010).  Women 
who smoke also have increased risk of cervical cancer, infertility, and early menopause 
(Hughes  & Brennan,  1996;  Sun et al., 2012;  US DHHS  Surgeon General’s  Report,  2004;  WHO 
2004).  
 
There is tremendous potential in this innovative public policy of reducing the nicotine content of 
cigarettes below an addiction threshold to reduce smoking prevalence and smoking -related 
disease and death in the US.  However, a serious limitation of these studies that is directly 
relevant to this proposal is that they uniformly excluded vulnerable populations.  This is an 
important gap in knowledge that must be addressed to c omprehensively evaluate the Benowitz 
and Henningfield hypothesis.  Understanding how smokers with psychiatric comorbidities and 
other vulnerabilities to smoking and smoking -related problems respond to reduced -nicotine 
cigarettes is essential for evaluating the potential impact of a nicotine reduction policy. This 
project represents the first investigation of reduced -nicotine cigarettes in smokers with mood  
and anxiety disorders and stands to contribute new scientific information with the potential to 
inform FDA policy decisions.  
 
Cigarettes  to be assessed  in this study:  
The cigarettes  to be used  in this study  were  made  under  an NIH contract  with production  being 
overseen by the Research Triangle Institute (referred to as “Spectrum cigarettes”).  NIH 
currently has approximately 10 million of these cigarettes (of varying types) for research 
purposes.  The cigarettes selected for the study span the range of yields likely to produce the 
hypothesized effects, as described above.  The Spectrum cigarettes are not currently 
commercially available, although they are similar in many ways to marketed cigarettes (e.g., 
similar manufacturing, filter, paper, etc.).  
The primary overall objective of this study is to evaluate the effects of extended exposure to 
cigar ettes  differing  in nicotine content  in female adult  smokers  of childbearing  age (18 -44 yrs) 
whose highest academic degree is high school using a 3 -condition, parallel groups design.  
After a baseline period in which daily smoking rate and other baseline ass essments are 
completed,  participants  will be randomly  assigned  to one of three  cigarette  conditions  (nicotine 
content: 0.0 3 mg, 0.12 mg, and 0.8 mg machine estimated nicotine delivery per cigarette ) for 
the 12 -week experimental period.  
 
Screening  Procedures 
Recruitment:  
A sample size of 207 completers is proposed to test the primary outcome.  Anticipating 25% 
attrition, and six pilot participants (3 at UVM, 3 at JHU), 282 participants will be enrolled across 
both sites (188 at UVM, 94 at JHU). Poten tial participants will respond to community 
advertisements (local newspapers, community bulletin boards, lab Facebook page, Facebook 
ads, lab website,  center  website,  Craigslist,  city buses,  etc.) that contain  a study  description,  link 
to an online survey and the name and phone number of the Research Assistant. Participants 
can choose to complete the pre -screening  questionnaire online or by phone. If deemed  eligible, 
those who complete the online questionnaire will be called by the Research Assistant to fur ther 
discuss the study. The RA will read a script briefly explaining the study. Participants will be 
informed that this is not a smoking cessation program, and that smoking cessation services are 
available  in the community  independent  of their decision  to participate  in this study.  If interested,  
91  they will be scheduled for an in -person screening interview. Those who call into the laboratory 
will be read a script briefly explaining the study.  After verbal informed consent is received, the 
participants  will be asked  questions  over the phone  to determine  initial  eligibility.  Callers  will be 
informed that  this is not a smoking  cessation  program,  and that  smoking  cessation services  are 
available in the community independent of their decision to participate in this study.  If eligible 
and interested, they will be scheduled for an in -person screening interview.  
Potential participants will be instructed to bring a pack of their usual brand cigarettes, all 
prescription  medications  they are currently  taking  and identification  (example,  driver’s  license)  to 
the screening visit. If participants anticipate not having acceptable ID site staff should consult 
with the project coordinator or study PI.  
A participant must complete her in -person screening session within 30 days of completing the 
pre-screening  questionnaire.  If the participant  is not able to attend  the in-person  screening  visit 
in that timeframe, she will need to complete the pre -screening questionnaire again.  
 
Informed  Consent  Process:  
Before beginning the informed consent process, potential participants will need to produce 
identification as described above.  The interviewer will confirm the age and identity of the 
participant.  If the participant is not between the ages of 18 and 44, she will be dismissed 
without payment.  During the in -person screening session, study information will be presented 
and written informed consent will be required prior to participating in the screening session.  In 
order to ensure adequate info rmed consent, participants will be asked to read the first several 
lines aloud (to determine literacy) and will then be given ample time to read the consent 
document.  If the interviewer suspects the participant is not literate, he or she will have them 
continue  reading  further  to confirm.  Inability  to read and comprehend  written  study  materials  will 
result in ineligibility and the interviewer will inform the participant that they  are not eligible. Only 
after the participant and the researcher are fully sati sfied that the participant understands the 
purpose of the study, the confidentiality of the data, the procedures, the risks/benefits and her 
rights as a research participant will the consent form be signed and the participant undergo 
screening procedures.  
 
Screening  Measures  
Those  who consent  will be screened  for eligibility  using  the following  measures:  
 
The following  physiological  measures  will be collected,  recorded  on paper,  and entered 
into REDCap  by the interviewer at the end of the visit:  
1) Breath alcohol levels (BAL)  will be measured using an Alcosensor monitor.  Participants 
with levels  over 0.01 g/l may  reschedule  the interview  but will need  to be re-consented  to 
ensure  they have  received  adequate  informed  consent.  They  will be excluded  if they are 
positive the second time.  
2) Weight  and height  will be measured  to determine  the participant’s  Body  Mass Index. 
Weight will be measured in kilograms and height will be measured in centimeters.  
3) Expir ed breath carbon monoxide (CO)  levels will be assessed using a Smokerlyzer 
ED50  CO meter  (Bedfont  Instruments),  a reliable  and valid measure  of recent  smoking.  
a. NicAlert  Strips  will be used  to asses  urinary  cotinine  levels  if a participant's 
carbon monoxide reading is less than or equal to 8 ppm.  
92  4) A urine toxicological screen  will be performed to assess the presence of illicit drugs 
including marijuana, cocaine, opiates, oxycodone, benzodiazepines, barbiturates, 
amphetamines, methadone, buprenorphine, methamphetamines, MDMA and PCP. 
Participants who fail the  drug screen for dr ugs other  than marijuana may reschedule the 
interview but will need to be re -consented to ensure they have received adequate 
informed consent.  They will be excluded if they are positive for drugs other than 
marijuana  the second  time.  Urine  Pregnancy  Test (HCG  detection)  will be performed  for 
all participants.  
5) Blood  pressure  and heart  rate will be measured  using  a CritiCare  monitor  to help the 
licensed medical professional determine final participant eligibility.  
 
The following  screening  questionnaires  will be participant -administered  via paper  and 
then will be entered into REDCap by the interviewer at the end of the visit:  
1) Identifying Information Form  will include the participant’s REDCap Subject Identifier, 
name,  address  (including  the county  of residence),  email  address,  phone  number,  age, 
date of birth, and social security number (if applicable).  
a. This form will be entered  into the ‘Identifying  Information  Access  Database’.  
i. Each  site will have  a separate  ‘Identifying  Information  Access  Database’.  
ii. Identifying  information  will not be shared  with other  sites.  Each  site is 
responsible for maintaining confidentiality of this information.  
iii. Identifying information will be kept in a locked file cabinet (source 
document)  and in a password  protected  Access  Database  (electronic 
version) separate from all other study data.  
2) Beck  Depression  Inventory  (BDI;  Beck,  Ward,  & Mendelson,  1961),  to assess 
depressive symptoms.  
3) Overall  Anxiety  Severity  and Impairment  Scale (OASIS;  Norman  et al., 2006)  to assess 
frequency and severity of anxiety symptoms.  
 
The following  screening  assessments  will be administered  as an interview and  then  will 
be entered into REDCap  by the interviewer at the end of the visit:

and entered  into REDCap.  
 
 
The following  screening  assessments  will be completed  by the participant  directly  in 
REDCap, except where noted:  
93  1) Demographic  History  Questionnaire , which  will assess  age, gender,  ethnicity,  race, 
education, income, marital status, and employment history.  
2) Alcohol  Use Questionnaire  (12 month  and 1 month  version)  
3) Drug  Use Questionnaire  (12 month  and 1 month  version)

6) Smoking  Stages  of Change Algorithm  as well as a contemplation  ladder  to assess 
intention to quit smoking (DiClemente et al., 1991).  
7) The Mini International  Neuropsychiatric  Interview  (MINI  6.0) (Sheehan  et al., 1990) a 
structured diagnostic interview to evaluate psychiatric disorders.  
a. Will be completed  by participant  through  the In-Home  Screening  system 
supported by Medical Outcomes Systems.  
 
In the event that the REDCap website is not functioning, the assessments will be printed out 
and administered  on paper.  The source documents  will be kept  in the  participant’s  binder.  The 
interviewer will enter the data into REDCap when it resumes functioning properly.  This 
information  should  be recorded  in the ‘End of Visit Evaluation  Form’  and filed in the participant’s 
binder.  
Suicidality/Mental  Health  Monitoring  
Participants who endorse any suicidal ideation questions, indicate suicidal intention in the past 
month or a suicide attempt in the past  6 months as indicated on the as indicated on the BDI 
(score > 0 on question  9) or MINI suicide subscale (endorse question  3, 4 and/or 5 on the MINI 
suicide subscale or question 6 on the MINI suicide subscale with suicide attempt in the past 6 
months) or answer “yes” to question A3g  on the MINI  Neuropsychiatric  interview and symptoms 
have  occurred  in the past two weeks, will  not be eligible  to participate  in the study.  The research 
staff member  will contact  a licensed  on-site clinician  for evaluation.  In the event  that no clinician 
is available, staff will put the participant in contact with the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline 
at 1-800-273-8255. They will also contact the Study Coordinator and Site PI to inform them of 
the situation as soon as possible.  Additionally, they will contact the Project Coordinator to 
inform her of the situation. The participant will be paid $25 (+$25 bon us if applicable) and 
provided with local mental health resources. Post enrollment, any report of suicidal ideation or 
attempt by a participant will be grounds for immediate withdrawal from the study.

20) Co- habitation  with any former  research  participant  who was provided  with Spectrum 
research cigarettes to smoke outside the lab.  
 
Children under age 18 are excluded because they cannot legally buy cigarettes.  Those with 
unstable medical, psychiatric, or medica tion conditions (as determined by the licensed medical 
professional)  are excluded  as these  symptoms  could  affect  a participant’s  ability  to complete  the 
study.  Examples include but are not limited to the following: angina, stroke, heart attack which 
occurred since phone screening, blood clots in the arms or legs for which the individual is 
undergoing  active  medical  treatment,  cancer  requiring  active  chemotherapy  or radiation  therapy, 
severe shortness of breath caused by conditions such as uncontrolled  asthma, COPD, or 
arrhythmia, active untreated infection such as pneumonia, active untreated endocrine disorder 
such as  hyperthyroidism.  We will exclude those currently seeking  smoking  treatment  and those 
who plan to quit in the next 30 days, as  participat ion in this study may  not lead to reductions in 
smoking.  We will  exclude  pregnant  or nursing  women and women  of reproductive potential  who 
are unwilling  to use  acceptable forms  of birth control  throughout  the study.  We will also exclude 
anyone with current or recent alcohol or drug abuse problems as these factors could 
independently affect smoking behavior during the study.  Individuals with baseline CO readings 
greater than 80 ppm, those with heart rate or blood pressure readings that are out of rang e 
(systolic: 90 -159 mmHg; diastolic: 50 -99 mmHg; HR: 45 -114 bpm) and anyone who has 
attempted suicide in the past six months will be excluded from the study for safety concerns.  
Individuals who smoke ‘roll your own’ cigarettes exclusively will be excluded from the study 
because  we will be unable  to standardize  their baseline  smoking  behavior.  Individuals  who have 
recently participated in a research study will be excluded as participation may have changed 
their smoking behavior, which may preclude a stable s moking baseline.  Because participants 
are required to complete portions of the protocol independently, they will need to be able to 
independently read and comprehend the study materials.  
 
Eligibility  Determination:  
The research assistant will review the entire screening assessment battery for initial eligibility 
determination, confirming the subject meets the above described inclusion/exclusion criteria. 
The final eligibility of the participant will be determined by a licensed medical professional (MD, 
DO, NP, PA, Master’s prepared RN or CRN) at each site after reviewing the Medical History 
Questionnaire, BDI, Mini Neuropsychiatric Interview, and the MINI suicide subscale.  The 
licensed medical professional may meet wi th a participant if available and think it necessary for 
eligibility determination.  He/she will sign off on eligibility prior to the first baseline visit.  If the 
licensed medical  professional  determines  the participant  is not medically  eligible to  participate in 
the study, has current symptomatology that would interfere with interpretation of the data or is 
unlikely to complete the study he/she will inform the research assistants who will contact the 
participant prior to the first baseline visit.  The licensed medical professional will not need to 
review the medical history forms of participants who are not eligible for other, non -medical 
reasons.  
If a participant  fails the urine  toxicology  screen  due to a prescription  medication  he/she  is taking, 
then he/she will not be automatically excluded.  The interviewer will make note of this when 
he/she submits the forms to the licensed medical professional for final eligibility determination.  
96  Once all the screening procedures have been completed,  researchers will pay participants $25 
(+$25 bonus if applicable) for their time as long as they pass the drug and breath alcohol tests 
and meet  the minimum  requirements  for carbon  monoxide  or NicAlert  levels.  Those  participants 
who do not pass these tests  or meet these requirements will be dismissed from the study 
without payment.  Marijuana will be tested for but will not be an exclusionary criterion.  If a 
participant does not pass the drug test but has a current, valid prescription that would explain 
the failed test he/she will not  be automatically excluded and will still receive the visit payment.  
Participants  who meet  all other  eligibility  criteria,  sans  the medical  criteria,  will be scheduled  for 
the first baseline visit.  
At the end of the screening session, the researcher will complete the End of Visit Evaluation 
Form, which will be filed in the subject’s binder.  This will allow the researcher to make note of 
any problems  encountered during  the visit,  to track  which computers  were  used for  which tasks, 
and to assess the truthfulness of the participant in regards to self -report of tobacco use.  
 
Baseline  Procedures  
This study will use a one -week, two -session baseline period to collect baseline individual 
difference measures and monitor daily u sual-brand smoking behavior.  At Baseline 1, 
participants will be provided their usual brand cigarettes to smoke, equivalent to 150% of their 
daily smoking  rate. A time line follow  back  (TLFB)  will be used  to assess  the daily cigarette use 
for the past 7 days.  Participants will be provided their usual brand cigarettes for the first seven 
days of the baseline period.  If the baseline period extends past seven days, participants will 
need to purchase their own usual brand cigarett es. Use of a two session baseline period will 
ensure stability of daily smoking reports, reduce reactivity to the daily cigarette monitoring, and 
reduce participant burden.  During the two baseline sessions, participants will complete 
subjective questionnai res, assessments of cognitive functioning, and smoking topography.  
Each visit will last approximately two to four hours.  At the end of each baseline session, the 
researcher  will complete  the End of Visit Evaluation  Form,  which  will be filed in the particip ants’ 
binder.  This will allow the researcher to make note of any problems encountered during the 
visit, to track  which computers  were used for which tasks,  and to assess  the truthfulness  of the 
participant in regards to self -report of tobacco use.  
Visit scheduling  requirements  for baseline  period:  
Participants will be required to schedule the Baseline 1 visit within 30 days of their screening 
visit. If a participant still wants to be in the study after 30 days, he/she will need to be re - 
screened.  The participant will need to be re -consented but will maintain the original REDCap 
Subject  Identifier.  The ideal  target  window  separating  Baseline 1 and Baseline 2 is  between 7 
and 12  days.  The minimum  is 7 days  and the maximum  is 21 days.  If the participant  does not 
complete the visit  within  21 days,  then he/she will  not be rescheduled and will be discontinued 
from the study.  
Measures/Assessments  
Physiological  measures  collected  at Baseline  1, recorded  on paper,  and entered  into 
REDCap  by the interviewer at the end of the visit:  
1) BAL 
2) Weight  
97  3) CO 
4) Blood  Pressure  
5) Heart  Rate 
6) Urine  Toxicology  
The following  questionnaires  will be participant -administered  via paper  at Baseline  1 and 
then will be entered into REDCap by the interviewe r at the end of the visit:  
1) BDI 
2) OASIS  
 
The following  assessments  will be administered  as an interview at  Baseline 1  and then 
entered into REDCap by the interviewer at the end of the visit:  
1) Concomitant  Medications  Form  
2) Health  Changes  Questionnaire,  which  will assess  any weekly  health  changes,  
3) Time  Since  Last Cigarette  Questionnaire  
 
The following  assessments  will be administered  at Baseline  1 and completed  by the 
participant directly in REDCap:  
 
1) Perceived  Health  Risks  Rating  (Hatsukami  et al., 2010),  a measure  of the perceived 
addictive potential and other health risks associated with cigarettes  
2) Respiratory  Health  Questionnaire , a measure  of cough,  shortness  of breath  and other 
respiratory symptoms  
3) Minnesota  Nicotine Withdrawal  Scale  (MNWS;  Hughes  & Hatsukami,  1986),  a measure 
of nicotine withdrawal  
4) Questionnaire  of Smoking  Urges -brief scale - Usual  Cigarette  (QSU;  Cox, Tiffany,  & 
Christen, 2001; Tiffany & Drobes, 1991), which measures the urge to smoke  
5) Cigarette  Evalu ation  Scale  – Usual  Cigarette (CES;  Westman,  Levin,  & Rose,  1992), 
which measures responses to cigarettes (e.g., reward, satisfaction).  
6) Intolerance for Discomfort Questionnaire - (IDQ; Sirota et al., 2013), assesses 
intolerance  for the discomfort  of smoking  abstinence.  The measure  includes  three 
subscales: physical discomfort, emotional discomfort and smoking withdrawal 
discomfort.  
13) Cigaret te Purchase Task – Usual Brand Version (CPT; MacKillop et al., 2008), a self - 
report analogue of a progressive -ratio schedule that measures the relative reinforcing 
efficacy of  cigarettes by querying  how many  of that day’s cigarette they would consume 
in a day at varying  prices.  This task will indicate  whether  prolonged  VLNC  cigarette  use 
reduces cigarette demand and increases sensitivity to increases in cigarette costs.  
14) Perceived  Stress  Scale - 4 item (PSS -4; Cohen,  Kamarck,  & Mermelstein,  1983),  which 
measures the degree to which life situations are appraised as stressful.  
15) Positive  and Negative  Affect  Schedule  (PANAS;  Watson,  Clark,  & Tellegan,  1988), 
which measures symptoms of positive and negative affect.  
 
Physiological  measures  collected  at Baseline  2, recorded  on paper  and entered  into 
REDCap by the interviewer at the end of the visit:  
98  1) BAL 
2) Weight  
1) CO 
2) Blood  Pressure  
3) Heart  Rate 
4) Urine  Toxicology  
5) Urine  Pregnancy  
The following  assessments  will be administered  as an interview  at Baseline  2 and then 
entered into REDCap by the interviewer at the end of the visit:  
1) Concomitant  Medications  Form  
2) Health  Changes Questionnaire  
3) Time  Since  Last Cigarette  Questionnaire  
 
The following assessments will be administered at Baseline 2 and completed by the 
participant  on paper  and entered  into REDCap  by the interviewer  at the end of the visit:  
1) BDI 
2) OASIS  
 
The following  assessments  will be administered  at Baseline  2 and completed  by the 
participant directly in REDCap:  
1) FTND  
2) WISDM  
 
In the event that the REDCap website is not functioning, the assessments will be printed out 
and administered  on paper.  The source documents  will be kept  in the  participant’s  binder.  The 
interviewer will enter the data into REDCap when it resumes functioning prop erly. This 
information  should  be recorded  in the ‘End of Visit Evaluation  Form’  and filed in the participant’s 
binder.  
Cognitive  Tasks  (Baseline  2 Only):  
Cognitive  functioning  will be assessed  using  a battery  of computer -based  assessments.  We will 
assess domains that are theoretically linked to smoking and likely to be sensitive to nicotine 
abstinence (Heishman, 1999; Kleykamp et al., 2005; Rycroft et al., 2006).  Prior to test 
administration, participants will be trained to ensure their underst anding of each test.  Tests will 
be administered on a desktop computer.  
1) N-Back (0,2) Task (Ernst et al., 2001): A measure of working memory in which 
participants  view serially  presented  letters  on a computer.  They  must  indicate  whether 
each letter presented  is the same or different from the letter presented a specified 
number of positions back in the string of letters (e.g. 2 -back).  
2) 2-Letter Search (Ernst et al., 2001): A measure of focused attention in which 
participants  view strings  of letters  on a compute r screen  looking  for whether  each  string 
contains or does not contain two target letters.  
3) Continuous Performance Test (CPT; Myers et. Al., 2008): A measure of sustained 
attention,  participants  must  monitor  a string  of stimuli  (e.g. letters)  serially  presented  on 
99  a computer  screen  monitoring  for presentation  of a target  stimulus.  The task is balanced 
so that they either  must  respond,  or inhibit  a response each  time the target  is presented.  
4) Stop  Signal  Task  (SST;  Logan  et al., 1984):  A computer  administered test  of behavioral 
inhibition.  Participants make frequent motor responses (e.g., left/right responses 
indicating if a visually presented arrow points left or right) and occasional, unpredictable 
response inhibitions (e.g., wh en a second arrow, pointing upwards, is presented).  The 
stop signal delay (the interval between the onset of the go signal and stop signal) is 
adjusted after each stop trial according to the participants’ performance to achieve 50 
percent inhibition succes s rate.  
5) Nicotine Stroop Task (Stroop, 1935): Frequently used measure of inhibitory control 
functioning. It measures the ability to focus attention on relevant stimuli while ignoring 
distracters and to suppress a prepotent response (i.e., word reading) in f avor of an 
atypical one (i.e., color naming).  Participants will be shown a number of images.  The 
images will either be nicotine related, evocative, or neutral in nature with different color 
borders (red, blue, green yellow).  The participants will be asked to use response 
triggers  to identify  the color  of the border  for each  picture  as they appear  on the screen.  
 
Smoking  Topography  (Baseline 2  Only):  
Puff Topography, a precise measure of smoking behavior (Brauer  et al., 1996; Herning et al., 
1981; Robinson & Forbes, 1975), will be used to examine whether prolonged use of the 
experimental  cigarettes  affects  topography  measures  that may indicate  smoking  compensation 
(Strasser et al., 2007).  Puff topography will be assessed using a CReSS pocket device that 
provides a valid measurement  of puff number,  puff volume,  inter-puff interval and  other indices 
(Blank et al., 2009).  Carbon monoxide readings will be collected before and 15 minutes after 
puff topography.  Particip ants will smoke one cigarette of their usual brand.  
 
Interactive  Voice  Response  System:  
At the end of the first baseline visit, participants will be trained to use the Interactive Voice 
Response (IVR) System,  which will  contact  participants  each day  throughout  the study  and ask 
about their smoking behavior as well as withdrawal symptoms the week before and after 
Baseline  2. We will also review  the IVR adherence  incentive  program,  which  consists of  $1 per 
call plus a $10 bonus for seven consecutive cal ls. Participants will be provided a study cell 
phone if they have unreliable telephone access, do not have enough monthly cell phone 
minutes or prefer not to use their own phone.  
 
The IVR system  is operated  by TeleSage.  To be  enrolled  in the IVR system,  research  staff will 
enter the participants initials, telephone number, subject identifier, and visit dates into the IVR 
TCORS website.  Identifying information (initials and telephone numbers) will not be extracted 
with the data by the bioinformatics group.  Please refer to TeleSage’s privacy statement and 
HIPAA compliance form for additional information.  
 
Baseline  2 biological  specimens:  
1) Urine  sample  for smoking  biomarker  assessment : 
Participants will be asked to bring a urine sample (first void of the day) to the second 
baseline session for biomarker assessment.  Samples will be stored at temperatures no 
more than -80°C. The tobacco -specific carcinogen  biomarkers are total NNAL and PAH. 
Anatabine and anabasine will be tested in the VLNC condition to vali date abstinence or 
measure  the extent  of nicotine  replacement  therapy  being  used.  Total  cotinine  levels  will 
also be assessed to measure daily nicotine exposure.  Participant’s will be reminded  
100  with a phone  call the day before  the visit, those  who forget  will be asked  to provide  an 
onsite urine sample.  
 
2) Pulmonary  Marker:  
Fractional Exhaled Nitric Oxide (FeNO) will be assessed as  a measure  of lung  function 
using  the NIOX  VERO,  a hand -held device  for exhaled  NO analysis.  FeNO  involves  no 
storing or shipping of specimens, rather, the participant will exhale slowly through the 
device to obtain the result, which will be recorded in the participant’s source.  
3) Cardiovascular  Markers:  
Blood samples will be used for measurement of a ba ttery of cardiovascular biomarkers 
primarily focusing on three areas: glucose tolerance (fasting insulin, glucose,  
hemoglobin A1C), clotting markers (thrombin, fibrinogen, PAI -1), inflammatory markers 
(C-reactive protein, interleukin -6, D-Dimer). Secondary  measures include: Fasting lipid 
profile (total cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL -C, LDL -C). Participants will be required to 
fast for a minimum  of 8 hours.  Ideally,  participants  will not eat or drink  after midnight  and 
blood draws will be done in the mornin g. After the blood draw, participants will be 
provided with a meal voucher so that they may eat  before performing the remaining visit 
tasks.  The following volumes and tubes will be collected: Two 5 mL SST tubes, one 10 
mL EDTA tube and two 2.7 mL citrate t ubes . 
4) Additional  Blood  Samples : 
Blood samples will also be used for assessing individual differences in nicotine 
metabolism  by phenotyping  (i.e., Nicotine  Metabolic  Ratio,  NMR,  which  is phenotypically 
estimated  as the ratio  of 3-hydroxycotinine [3 HC]  to cotinine [COT] in plasma).  One 10 
mL EDTA tube will be collected.  
 
We will store  blood  for the purposes  of analyzing  additional  cardiovascular  biomarkers  or 
genotyping of individual differences in nicotine metabolism (CYP2A6) analyses of 
nicotine metabolism (variation in CYP2A6) or nicotinic acetylcholine receptor gene 
subtypes. All samples will be stored at the University of Vermont Tracy Lab.  
 
Biomarker  shipping  and storage:  
Biomarkers will be shipped quarterly to th e University of Vermont Laboratory for Clinical 
Biochemistry Research (Tracy Lab).  The Tracy Lab will serve as a central repository for all 
biomarker  specimens  and will be responsible  for distributing  specimens  to the appropriate  labs 
on a quarterly  basis.  Urine  samples  will be analyzed  and stored  at the University  of Minnesota 
Hecht Lab.  Cardiovascular Biomarkers will be analyzed and stored at the Tracey Lab.  
Additional  blood  samples  for the purposes  of phenotyping  will be analyzed  and stored at the 
University of Toronto Tyndale Lab.  
 
Baseline  fMRI  testing  (University  of Vermont  only):  
Participants at the UVM site will complete the neuroimaging battery two or three days after the 
first baseline assessment,  depending  on availability.  This battery  will be completed only  among 
a randomly selected subset of participants in the lowest and the highest dose conditions (45 
participants/dose condition for total  of 90 participants),  which will  provide the greatest  likelihood 
of de tecting differences between nicotine doses.  Forty -five participants from each of the two 
conditions will be selected with the goal of having 20 completers from each of the doses.  
Participants  who consent  to neuroimaging  and meet  the eligibility  criteria  will be encouraged  to 
abstain  from smoking  for approximately  24 hours  before  their scan.  Abstinence  will be verified 
by expired breath carbon monoxide levels that have decreased by at least 50% from the  
101  measure  taken  during  the Baseline  1 visit. The battery  includes  fMRI  assessments  that parallel 
the behavioral/cognitive assessments described above (i.e., a sustained attention task, 
inhibitory control test of executive function) and that are sensitive to abstinence -related 
disrup tions in performance.  
 
Prior to Baseline scan, participants will partake in a practice session of the fMRI cognitive 
battery  tasks  in a mock  scanner  at the Clinical  Research  Center  (CRC)  in order  to practice  each 
task in an environment that closely mimics that of the actual fMRI machine itself.  
The neuroimaging  battery  also includes  a high-resolution anatomical scan to  assess  total and 
regional  grey matter  volumes  and cortical  thickness,  a resting - state scan to assess  intra- and 
inter-regional  brain  connectivity,  and arterial  spin labeling  to provide a  quantitative  measure  of 
blood flow.  Baseline characterization and comparison with a second scan approximately 12 
weeks later will provide the potential for insights into the neurobiology of dependence and 
withdrawal (including individual differences in dependence severity) and differential changes 
that may arise from being exposed for an extended period to VLNC versus usual nicotine 
content levels in commercially available cigarettes.  
 
Experi mental  Procedures 
Experimental Period:  
Participants will be seen weekly throughout the 12 -week experimental period.  Weeks 2, 6, 12 
and the abstinence visit will take approximately 2 -4 hours each.  All other sessions will last 
approximately  2 hours.  Upon  arrival at the laboratory,  participants  will provide urine and breath 
BAL and CO samples.  If the participant has a positive urine toxicology screen the Research 
Assistant  will initiate  the Field  Sobriety  SOP  to determine  if the participant  can continue  with the 
session or if it should be rescheduled. At the end of  each experimental session, the researcher 
will complete the End of Visit Evaluation Form, which will be filed in the participant’s binder.  
This will allow  the researcher  to make  note of any problems  encountered  during  the visit, to 
track which computers were used for which tasks, and to assess the truthfulness of the 
participant in regards to self -report of tobacco use and compliance to study procedures.  
 
Visit  scheduling  requirements  for experimental  period:  
The ideal scheduling window between each visit is  7 days based on the date of the Baseline 2 
Visit.  For additional scheduling requirements, refer to the ‘ Scheduling Visits SOP ’. If a 
participant misses a visit and is not able to reschedul e during the window (± 3 days), that visit 
will not be ‘made -up’ in the future.  All measures that  were not completed will be considered 
missing  data and will not  be collected during  future visits.  If a visit  mistakenly  occurs outside  of 
the designated  window,  this is a protocol  deviation.  A ‘Non -Medical  Event  Form’  will need  to be 
completed.  Additionally, each visit should occur at approximately the same time of day ± 2 
hours.  
If a participant  is not able to attend  his/her  Week  12 visit, then it  should be rescheduled even if  it 
is outside of the scheduling window.  This will be documented as a protocol deviation.

changes after extended exposure to different doses.  Participants who have initiated a quit 
attempt  will not be asked  to smoke  prior to the scan.  Participants  willing to  smoke  the research  
104  cigarettes  will take two puffs  30 minutes  prior to the scan.  If the participant  is unwilling  to smoke 
the research cigarette, they will be allowed to smoke their usual brand.

Interactive  Voice  Response  System:  
Participants will continue to use the IVR system on a daily basis  throughout the experimental 
period to record the number of study cigarettes smoked per day and use of non -study 
cigarettes.  During  the first  week  after Baseline  2, the IVR  system  will collect  information  about 
withdrawal symptoms.  
Variable  Incentive  Progr am: 
An incentive  program  has been  developed  with the goal of improving  attendance  at scheduled 
assessment sessions, compliance with using only study -provided tobacco products, and 
encouraging honest self -reports regarding all nicotine/tobacco use.  
 
Briefly, participants will receive a total of five tickets for each weekly visit they attend after 
randomization (Visits 03 -14, weeks 1 -12). In total, participants could earn 60 valid tickets  
across the 12 visits.  Participants will b e instructed that these tickets correspond to attendance 
(one ticket), honest reporting (one ticket), and adherence to using only the assigned study 
product (three tickets).  They will be further instructed that these tickets “could” be eligible for 
entry  into a monthly  drawing  for prizes,  but that only tickets  that are “validated”  will be eligible for 
prizes.  
 
Since it is prohibitively expensive to test urine samples each week for each participant and 
because  it is currently  not feasible  to detect  with reasonable  precision  non-compliance  based  on 
biomarkers in the two higher nicotine group, we plan to only validate the attendance tickets.  
Hence,  each  participant  who attends  their regularly  scheduled  weekly  session  will have  a total 
of five validated tickets entered into the monthly drawing.  
 
To convey the message that we may be validating honest reporting and use of only study - 
provided products, we will collect a weekly urine specimen from participants.  Further, in a 
bogus pip eline of sorts, participants will be instructed and that these urine specimens MAY be 
used to biochemically verify compliance to the study product by testing different nicotine and 
tobacco products found in the urine.  Likewise, participants will also be in structed that their 
honesty  ticket  MAY  be validated  if their self-reported  tobacco  use matches  what’s  in their urine. 
So there is some minor deception involved, but technically we could conduct urine toxicology 
testing  for both purposes.  Hence,  if the urine toxicology testing  is presented  as something  that 
MAY be done for validation purposes, we feel that any deception is relatively minor.  For 
scientific/economic reasons we are just electing to restrict validation to attendance.  
Nevertheless, we will de brief all participants upon the completion of the trial.  We will inform 
them  that the incentive  program  was based  exclusively  on attendance  due to the relatively  high 
cost of urine toxicology  testing  and other  practical  problems  with shipping  the urines  for prompt 
testing.  
 
Drawings  will be conducted  on the  1st of each  month.  Validation  will be performed  by staff who 
105  have  no participant  interaction  and are not blind  to condition.  Any ticket  drawn  will be eligible  for 
an incentive as the only true contingency is for attendance.  There will be no mention of the 
basis for earning incentives (i.e., whether the ticket was for attendance, honesty, adherence,).  
Participants  will simply  be informed  that he or she earned  an incentive  from the drawing.  
 
Each  drawing  will be independent  (without  replacement);  consequently,  some  participants  will 
not win a prize and others may win more than one during the study if more than one of their 
tickets is drawn. After confirming winners , the remaining tickets from each month will be 
discarded (i.e.,  tickets will only  be entered into  one drawing).  The monthly prize  amounts are 
detailed below.  
 
We estimate based on the 2½ years we estimate it will take to complete this study, that 
particip ants will win an average  of approximately  $65 in prizes  or an additional  $5.50  per week 
per participant.  
 
Grand Prize (1): $500 cash 
Second  Prize  (1): $200  cash 
Third Prize (5): $10 cash  
Product  and Procedures  Compliance  Review  Sessions:  
At each  visit, Baseline  2 through  Week  11, participants  will be counseled  about  their use of the 
study cigarettes.  Participants will be asked about any concerns or obstacles associated with 
use of the study cigarettes.  The importance of honest self -reporting will be stressed.  
Participants will be told that they will not be penalized for use of other nicotine or tobacco 
products and that it is crucial for them to report any use of these products.  If difficulties are 
encountered, participants will be asked why they t hink they are experiencing difficulties (e.g., 
taste, withdrawal symptoms) and to problem -solve how to deal with these difficulties in order to 
meet the protocol requirements.  Additionally, participants will be counseled about their IVR 
completion,  visit attendance,  task engagement  and product  accountability.  Refer to the ‘ Product 
and Procedures Compliance Review Sessions SOP ’ for more information.  
Quit Attempts  During  the Study  Protocol:  
At each weekly session, we will ask the participant if he/she is currently abstaining from 
smoking  with the intention of  quitting.  If the answer  is no, then we will  also ask  if he/she is 
planning to quit smoking prior to his/her next scheduled visit.  
If a Participant  is Currently  Abstaining  from  Smoking  with the Intenti on to Quit:  
 
• Encourage  participant  to continue  abstaining  from smoking  
• Schedule  the participant  for normal  weekly  visits,  but no puff topography  
• Provide  the participant  with the ‘Clearing  the Air’ manual  and local smoking  cessation  
resources  
• Give the participant  the option  to take home  study  product  rather  than require  him/her  to 
take the product  
• If the participant choses to take home the study product have him/her sign a form 
acknowledging that cigarette availability could be detrimental to the quit attempt. 
Recommend  that he/she  put the product  “away”  at home  as to avoid  unwanted  cues  to 
smoke.  
106  • If the participant  chooses  not to take home  the study  product,  have  him/her  contact  the 
lab if he/she lapses and would like to pick up or b e mailed the study product prior to 
his/her next visit.  
 
If a Participant  is Planning  to Quit Smoking,  but has not initiated  the quit  attempt:  
 
• Ask if he/she has  identified a  target  quit date and,  if so, what  that target  date is. 
• Provide  the participant  with the ‘Clearing  the Air’ manual  and local smoking  cessation  
resources.  
• Provide  the participant with the  study  product  as usual.  Recommend that  on the target  
date he/she put  the product  “away”  at home as  to avoid  unwanted cues  to smoke.  
 
Abstinence  Assessment  Session:  
After the week 12 visit, participants will be required to come back for one additional visit the 
following  day. During  this visit,  participants will have  been encouraged to  abstain from smoking 
until their next scheduled visit (approximately 24 hours later).  The abstinence assessment 
session should be scheduled no less than 18 hours and no more than 30 hours after the Week 
12 visit.  Abstinence will be verified by expired breath carbon monoxide levels that have 
decreased to < 4 ppm.  This session will allow us to determine whether the experimental 
cigarettes have reduced the effects of abstinence on these measures relative to the control 
conditions.  If the participant  does  NOT  meet  abstinence criteria,  he/she will  only receive  $20 for 
the visit.

Participant  Compensation:  
Participants will receive $25 for completing the screening visit, plus an additional $25 bonus for 
completing the visit on time as scheduled.  Payment will be made regardless of enrollment as 
long as the participant passes the drug test, breath alcohol test, and meets the minimum 
requirements for carbon monoxide or NicAlert levels.  Participants who do not pass these tests 
will be dismissed  from the screening visit  without  payment,  except  in the event  they can produce 
a prescription for the medication that caused them to fail the drug test.  Participants will receive  
$100 for each of the shorter sessions (Baseline 1, Weeks 1, 2,  3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11),  $150 for 
each of the longer sessions (Baseline 2, Weeks 6 &12), up to $160 for the abstinence visit 
($150 for the visit + up to $10 for the preference test), $20 for biochemical verification of 
abstinence,  up to $221  for completin g daily IVR reports  of study  cigarette  and other  nicotine  and 
tobacco use.  Participants will also have a chance to earn an additional $50 bonus for every 
three visits that are completed on time as scheduled.  There will also be a $100 bonus for  
108  completing the study for a total bonus of $325.  If the participant does not  attend the screening 
visit or one of the weekly visits as scheduled, they will forfeit the bonus.  They will have a 
chance to  earn another  bonus  payment  with the  next set of three visits.  Participants  who do not 
complete the entire study will receive compensation for the sessions that they do complete.  
UVM participants who undergo fMRI testing will receive an additional $150/scan.  Total 
compensation for completing Study 2, including study visit payments, daily IVR calls and 
bonuses is $2301 (or $2601 if  participating in the fMRI testing). Participants will also have a 
chance  to earn additional  money  through  the Variable  Incentive  program.  As mentioned  above, 
partici pants will have a chance to earn additional incentives each month for compliance, 
honesty and attendance, however, we anticipate that on average, participants will win 
approximately $150 in prizes.  
 
End of Study:  
After  a participant  has completed  all study  procedures  and has been  paid for participation  the 
research assistant will read the following script and give the participant the Clearing the Air 
Manual.  
“If you’ve reduced your smoking during this study, we encourage you to continue these 
reduction s or even  consider  quitting.  We would  like to provide  you with some  resources  should 
you decide to try to abstain from smoking (give “Clearing the Air” and hotline  
information).  Please also feel free to consult with your physician and use any medications 
he/she deems appropriate.  We will call you in approximately 30 days to ask about your 
smoking since leaving the study.  There is  no right  answer and we know  how difficult  quitting 
can be.  Please just  answer  honestly.  The call  will take less  than 5 minutes.  Thanks  again for 
your participation.”  
The following  assessments will  be administered  using  REDCap:  
 
1) End of Study  Questionnaire  
 
30 Day Follow  up Phone  Call: 
Participants will receive a follow -up phone call between 25 and 35 days after the abstinence 
assessment session to assess their smoking patterns.  The phone questionnaire will last less 
than five minutes.  The questionnaire will ask if the participant is still smoking, how much and 
whether he/she has attempted to quit smoking since the en d of the study.  Participants will 
receive 5 variable incentive program lottery tickets for completing the call as compensation. 
Those who report abstinence will be invited to come in for biochemical verification and be 
compensated $40 for doing so.  A urine  sample will be collected to test urine cotinine levels. 
Additionally,  any Medical  Event  Forms  that remain  open  from the last session  will be discussed. 
If the participant became pregnant during the study, this would have been recorded as a 
medical event.  During this phone call, the research assistant will confirm her due date.  This 
event will remain open until  delivery.  At that time the licensed medical professional will contact 
the participant  to ask a few questions  about  the baby’s  health  and will update  the Medical  Event 
Form.  
 
Once  a participant  has completed  all study  procedures  and all open  events  have  been  closed,  
109  the PI will review  the participant’s  binder  and sign a form indicating  study  completion  for that 
participant.  
 
Randomization  
At the end  of the Baseline 1 session,  participants will be randomized into one of  three cigarette 
conditions.  Participants in each condition will be assigned cigarettes that match their menthol 
preference. Participants will be r andomized, using block randomization, in equal  number to the 
dose conditions, with randomization stratified by study site and menthol status. Each site will 
randomize participants until the total goal of 282 participants across both sites is reached, and 
no effort  will be made to recruit  a specific  number  of menthol  and non -menthol  smokers  at each 
site.

The lead statistician  will create  a randomization  schedule  for each  of the two sites,  amounting  to 
150% of expected enrollment at each site.  The excess randomization codes will be used in the 
event that a site will have to enroll extra participan ts due to unexpectedly slow enrollment  at 
another site.  The nicotine doses will be identified  by letter code  and the  number 2 (V2,  W2, X2, 
110  Y2) and only Administrative Core personnel with no participant contact will have the link 
between  the statistician’s  letter  code  and dose  assignments.  The randomization  schedules  and 
the link between the alphabetic code and treatment assignment will be maintained securely by 
the Administrative Core.  A second, sealed, copy will be secured in a s eparate building to 
protect against loss related to fire or other unforeseen events.  
The University of Vermont will be responsible for removing all identifying information from 
cigarettes received from the Research Triangle Institute (RTI), labeling each c arton with a blind 
code, assigning product using this blind code based on the randomization schedule being 
provided by the UVM Biostatistics Core, and shipping cigarettes to each site as needed based 
on recruitment.  Each site will be responsible for tracki ng product received and distributed to 
participants, collecting unused product from participants, and returning unused cigarettes to 
UVM.  The participants,  investigators  and study  staff will not have  knowledge  of which  product  is 
given to a participant or whether different participants received the same or different product.  
During the experimental period, participants will be provided with a 14 -day supply of research 
cigarettes equivalent to 150% of their daily smoking rate.  This rate will be calculated at  
Baseline 2 and will be an average daily smoking rate based on the IVR data for the first seven 
days  of the baseline  period.  This will ensure  adequate  availability  of cigarettes  in the numerous 
locations  participants may typically keep a supply (home, work, vehicle, etc.) as well as avoid 
expending  the entire supply if  they miss a scheduled  visit. Participants will be instructed to use 
the research cigarettes for 12 weeks, at which point they are to disco ntinue product use.  
If there  is prior knowledge  a participant  will be missing  a visit  (i.e. planned  vacation,  laboratory 
closure, etc.), then the participant will be provided with an adequate supply of cigarettes to 
make up for the missed visit(s).  The par ticipant will be given a 21 -day supply if one visit is 
going to be missed and a 28 -day supply if two visits are going to be missed.  
Participants will be asked to refrain from use of other non -study cigarettes during the study 
period. If participants have t o use another nicotine product, they will be told to use a non - 
combustible product (gum, patch, etc.).  Additionally, they will be told there is not a penalty for 
use of non -study cigarettes, and that it is crucial for them to report any use of non -study 
cigarettes or other nicotine or tobacco products.  Throughout the baseline and experimental 
periods, an Interactive Voice Response (IVR) system will be used on a daily basis to record the 
number  of study  cigarettes  and non -study  cigarettes  used the previous  day. During  the baseline 
and first experimental week, participants will also answer daily IVR questions  about their mood. 
Participants will be seen weekly for assessments.  Brief standardized review sessions focusing 
on compliance with the study ci garettes and other study procedures will be provided at each 
visit. At the end of the 12 -week trial, participants will undergo an assessment of withdrawal, 
craving, and cognitive function following a brief period of abstinence.  
 
Product  Accountability:  
Participants  will be required  to keep  track  of all the cigarettes  provided  to them.  Therefore,  they 
will be instructed to return all unused cigarettes and empty cigarette packs to the laboratory 
each week.  Research staff will complete the ‘Product Accountabil ity Log’ with the participants. 
Any discrepancies in the product dispensed versus product returned will be discussed and  
111  recorded in the log.  Empty  cigarette packs  will not be saved.  Unused cigarette packs  will be re - 
distributed to the parti cipants during Weeks 1 -11. During Week 12, any remaining unused 
cigarettes returned by the participants will be collected by the research staff.  
 
Participants  who report  running  out of cigarettes  prior to a scheduled weekly  visit will be allowed 
to come in for  an unscheduled visit  to obtain  more research cigarettes.  If a participant  has more 
than two unanticipated visits  we will  determine if  a rate change is  necessary.  To determine this, 
we will look  at the past two CO levels as compared to the Basel ine 2 CO.  If the CO trend is 
consistent  with the self-report  of smoking  all of the allotted  cigarettes  then a rate increase  will be 
granted.  The participant will then receive cigarettes at a rate of 175% of their daily smoking 
rate. The maximum increase is  200% of their daily smoking  rate. If participants lose more than 
two packs of cigarettes and require an unscheduled visit to the laboratory to supplement their 
supply, they will be told the next time they lose more than two packs they will have  to wait until 
their next scheduled appointment to receive more cigarettes.  
Statistical  Methods  and Sample  Size 
Statistical  methods . See Statistical  Analysis  Plan at the end of this Supplemental  document.  
 
Sample size. Sample size for other analyses was determined using power analysis for 
hypothesis tests related to the Primary Aim of Study 2, specifically to detect a significant 
difference between the reduced -nicotine conditions and the high -nicotine yield condition in the 
primary  endpoints,  cigarettes  per day (CPD)  and urine cotinine,  at the end of  the trial.  Donny  et 
al. (2015) found a reduction of  4.52 CPD and  6.07 CPD among  subjects smoking  0.12 mg/g  
and 0.03 mg machine estimated nicotine delivery per cigarette, respectively, compared to those 
smoking normal nicotine cigarettes.  In addition, they reported a decrease of 0.59 and 0.39 in 
urine cotinine among those smoking these same RNC cigarettes, compared to those  smoking 
NNC cigarettes.  A sample size of  69 completers per condition will provide 90% power to detect 
similar differences in CPD and greater than 95% power to detect differences in urine cotinine, 
with a two -sided type I error rates of  0.02.  The type I er ror rate reflects the Bonferroni 
correction needed to allow testing of all pair -wise comparisons.  Regarding fMRI power, the 
analysis was based on the estimated effect size of 2.04 (Cohen's d) from the cortical activation 
differences previously observed bet ween  smokers  and ex-smokers  on the same  inhibitory  
control  task proposed  here (Nestor  et al., 2011).  With 20 completers in each condition, there is 
80% power at p = 0.05 to detect effects about half as large (Cohen d=0.91) between any two 
conditions.  
 
Potential  Risks of Participation  
1) Survey  Questionnaires : The interview  will include  questions  about  medical  history,  drug 
and alcohol  use, and questionnaires  about  mood.  Answering  these personal  questions 
could make the participant feel uncomfortable.  
2) Breac h of Confidentiality : The risk of the interview  is loss of privacy  if other  people  find 
out the results.  
3) Coercion : Coercion  is a possible  risk due to monetary  compensation  for participating  in 
these studies.  The likelihood of this risk is low because the compensation is 
commensurate with the amount of time and effort required for these studies.  
4) Drug  Testing : A breach of  confidentiality  could occur  and other  people could learn of  the 
participant’s  drug use. 
112  5) Obtaining blood pressure : The blood pressure cuff may cause minimal discomfort.  In 
obtaining  blood  pressure,  researchers  may find out the participant  has abnormal  blood 
pressure.  
6) Smoking  Cigarettes : All cigarettes  are detrimental  to a person’s  health  and can lead to 
significant  medical  problems  including:  
m. Cardiovascular Diseases: Coronary heart disease, heart attack, stroke, 
peripheral  vascular  disease,  reduced  blood  circulation,  abdominal aortic 
aneurysm  
n. Respiratory  Diseases:  Emphysema,  bronchitis,  and chronic  airway  obstruction  
o. Cancers:  Cancer  of the lung,  bladder,  cervix,  esophagus,  kidney,  larynx,  mouth, 
pancreas, throat, and stomach; leukemia  
p. Metabolic  Diseases:  Type  2 Diabetes  
q. Other Health Risks Associated with Smoking: Including but not limited to 
infertil ity, lower  bone  density  in postmenopausal  women,  and hip fracture  in 
women  
r. Death  
7) Smoking study cigarettes : In addition to the above medical problems, participants may 
experience some minor adverse health effects such as headaches or experience 
withdrawal s ymptoms, which are listed below.  Due to the altered nicotine levels, there 
could be a change in their cigarette use including the manner in which they inhale the 
smoke.  Smoking the study cigarettes does not provide any less risk than their usual 
brand  cigarette  and could  pose  increased  health  risks.  Participants  may also experience 
increases in levels of carbon monoxide, a gas from smoke.  
8) Smoking  Withdrawal : Participants  may experience  smoking  withdrawal  symptoms  during 
this study.  The symptoms can be u ncomfortable but are typically of minimal risk. 
Smoking withdrawal symptoms include:  
a. Anger,  irritability,  frustration  
b. Anxiousness,  nervousness  
c. Depressed  mood  or sadness  
d. Desire  or craving  to smoke  
e. Difficulty  concentrating  
f. Increased  appetite,  hunger  or weight  gain 
g. Insomnia,  problems  sleeping  or awakening  at night 
h. Restlessness  
i. Impatience  
j. Constipation  
k. Dizziness  
l. Coughing  
m. Dreaming  or nightmares  
n. Nausea  
o. Sore Throat  
9) Returning to Regular Smoking:  It is possible that if participants return to smoking their 
usual  brand  of cigarette  at the end of the study  they may experience  mild and transient 
nausea, dizziness, and lightheadedness.  
10) Risk to Fetus : Smoking during pregnancy can lead to miscarriage, preterm delivery, 
stillbirth,  low birth weight,  problems  with the placenta,  birth defects  such  as cleft palate, 
sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), and early childhood behavioral problems.  
11) Changes in blood  pressure and/or heart rate : Smoking and nicotine can affect the 
cardiovascular  system,  which  may result  in changes  in blood  pressure  and/or  heart  rate. 
113  12) Exacerbation of  psychiatric  symptoms : Smoking  and nicotine can affect  a person’s  mood 
and emotions and are associated with psychiatric disorders including major depressive 
disorder, general anxiety disorder, bipolar disorder and eating disorders.  Any changes 
in nicotine or cigarettes consumption could adversely affect psychiatric conditions . 
13) MRI: The MRI scanner produces a loud banging noise and may be uncomfortable for 
people who become anxious in confined spaces.  The presence of metal in or on a 
participant’s body during an MRI scan can present a serious health risk.  The MRI staff 
will ask  participants in detail about any possible metal they may have in or on them. 
Regarding unexpected MRI findings, the participant will be informed of what was found. 
In addition, information about the incidental finding can be provided to the participant’s 
primary  doctor or the study team can refer them to an appropriate specialist.  The costs 
for any care that would  be needed  to diagnose  or treat an incidental  finding  would  not be 
covered by the research study and would be the responsibility of the participa nt. 
Avoiding  Risks  to Fetus:  
If participants choose to be sexually active, they should use an appropriate “double barrier” 
method  of birth control  (such  as female  use of a diaphragm,  or contraceptive sponge,  in addition 
to male use of a condom) or the female should be using prescribed “birth control” pills, patch, 
ring, injections, or implants or intrauterine device (IUD).  Participants will be tested for  
pregnancy every two weeks beginning at screening through the last study visit. If a participant 
beco mes pregnant during the study, she will be withdrawn from the study.  Approximately 30 
days after being withdrawn or having a positive pregnancy test at the last study visit, the 
research  staff will call the participant  to confirm  her due date.  The licensed  medical  professional 
will follow -up with the participant after delivery to ask questions about the baby’s health.  
Expected  benefits  of participation:  
There  are no immediate  benefits  from participating  in the study.  The information  obtained  from 
this study may ultimately help the Food and Drug Administration decide how best to regulate 
tobacco products with the goal of improving public health.  
 
Study  Debriefing:  
After  data collection  is complete,  participants  will receive  a letter  telling  them  which  condition 
they were randomized into and the results of the study thus far.  
 
Protection  Against  Risk 
Research data without identifiers will be maintained in a locked file cabinet and on password - 
protected computers in the research staff workplace, with only code numbers identifying 
subjects.  Study consent forms and the linkage between the participants’ n ames and codes will 
be stored  in a locked  file cabinet.  Interviews  with participants  will be conducted  in private  rooms. 
Urine samples for drug and pregnancy tests  and tobacco exposure biomarkers will be obtained 
in a private bathroom within the laboratory suite. Blood draws will be performed in a private 
patient room.  Subjective measures will be administered electronically.  The biostatistics and 
data-management tea m will provide consistent data -management practices for all data in the 
Center.  Validity and reliability of data will  be maximized by  using REDCap, which is housed on 
the Fletcher Allen Health Care, HIPAA compliant, computing system.  REDCap is a secure, 
web-based system that accommodates local and remote data collection by each project team, 
and allows for data entry work -flow monitoring and data quality control monitoring by biometry  
114  staff.  For data integrity,  data entry  windows  will follow  the structure  of paper forms  as much as 
possible to allow for ease of entry, and will use predefined choices to minimize errors when 
possible.  Data  quality  monitoring  will be facilitated  with periodic  down  loads  and analysis  using 
a variety of common statis tical program format such as SAS, Stata, R, and SPSS.  Quality 
control procedures will be conducted for all data collected, including analysis of missing data 
and logic checks for out of range and other anomalous values.  This secure electronic data 
gatherin g and transmission  plan,  overseen  by the experienced  biostatistical  team,  will minimize 
opportunities for breaches of confidentiality.  Biological samples for nicotine and carcinogen 
biomarker  analysis  will be marked with  participant  ID, stored in the  locked laboratory  suite,  and 
sent to a laboratory for analysis on a quarterly basis.  
 
All information collected as part of this study will be accessible only to research staff.  No 
information will be shared with participants’ clinicians unless the partici pant requests this in 
writing.  All investigators and staff have undergone (and any new staff will undergo) human 
subjects’ ethics training as required by UVM and are fully conversant with relevant ethical 
principals  around  confidentiality.  Assessments,  consenting  and study  procedures  will be closely 
supervised by the PI.  
 
The sponsors (NIDA/FDA) as well as the Institutional Review Board and regulatory authorities 
could  be granted  direct  access  to original  medical  and research  records  for verification  of clinical 
trial procedures and/or data.  If this is required, it will be done under conditions that will protect 
privacy to the fullest extent possible consistent with laws relating to public disclosure of 
information and the law -enforcement responsibilities of the agency.  
Data  Storage:  
Data will be stored locally at each site, at the University of Minnesota Masonic Cancer Center’s 
Bioinformatics  Core and  at the University  of Vermont.  Long -term storage of  all study  data,  for at 
least 7 years after study completion, will be at the University of Vermont.  
 
Adverse  Events  
The research assistant will ask about adverse events at each session, using a form that 
assesses the nature, severity, duration, action taken, and outcome of study -related adverse 
events.  AEs will be captured from the time of first study cigarette. Participants will be given 
contact cards to inform us of events that occur between study contacts.  Any AE that remains 
open will be reviewed and closed at an interview conducted 3 0 days after the study completion 
date (completers)  or when  the study  should  have  ended had  the participant  completed  the study 
(dropouts and those withdrawn by investigator).  
All procedures will be monitored to ensure that they conform to the approved protocol.  In 
addition, monitoring will be done of all unforeseen circumstances that might arise and affect 
safety; of all reports of serious adverse events as defined in 38 CFR 46  (death, new or 
prolonged hospitalization, persistent or significant disability/incapacity); of other significant 
adverse events (adverse events that lead to drop out by the participant or termination by the 
investigator);  of unexpected  adverse  events  resulting from the study,  and of expected  adverse 
events.  
115  Any SAE will be brought to the attention of the site PIs as soon as possible and not longer than 
24 hours.  Any AE or SAE that is both unexpected and related to study participation will be 
reported to the IRB within 7 days of the event.  The local IRB will make a determination as to 
whether additional reporting requirements are needed.  IRB actions will be reported to the 
funding agency by the PIs no less than annually an d more frequently as recommended by the 
local IRB.  Any SAEs will be summarized in the yearly Progress Reports to the funding agency, 
including a review of frequency and severity.  All SAEs will be followed through ongoing 
consultation with the physician car ing for the patient until they resolve, result in death, or 
stabilize and are not expected to improve.  The study staff will be in close contact with 
participants  and health  care providers  throughout  the study  to monitor  for potential  unanticipated 
problems . Any unanticipated problems will be discussed at the weekly research staff meetings 
and reported as required to the local IRB.  
Withdrawal  or Monitoring  of Participants  
For the participant’s  protection,  participants  will be withdrawn  immediately  from  the 
study if any of the following occur:  
1) Cardiovascular disease (CVD) event : Typically include s MI (heart attack), PTCA 
(angioplasty/stenting), bypass surgery, stroke, peripheral vascular disease (arterial 
blockages in arms or legs leading to procedure or surgery).  Less common CVD 
problems  would  be new cardiac  arrhythmias  (e.g.,  new atrial  fibrillation)  or new valvular 
disease (e.g., mitral or aortic regurgitation).  
2) DVT/PE  (deep  vein thrombosis/pulmonary  embolism,  i.e., blood  clots in the venous 
system).  
3) Suicide Attempt : A participant  will be withdrawn if  he/she  attempts  suicide  at any time 
during participation in the study.  
4) Psychiatric  Hospitalization : A participant  will be withdrawn  if he/she  is hospitalized  for 
psychiatric reasons at any time d uring participation in the study.  
5) Pregnancy : If participant indicates she is pregnant or has a positive pregnancy test at 
any time during the study, she will be withdrawn from the study, and this event will 
remain open  until delivery.  At that time the lice nsed  medical  professional  will contact  the 
participant to ask a few questions about the baby’s health and will update the open 
‘Medical Event Form’.  A positive pregnancy test at  Session  14 in Study 1  or Week  12 in 
Study 2 will trigger a ‘Medical Event Form’ to be completed but will not result in 
withdrawal since she is no longer receiving study product.  
6) Expired  breath  carbon  monoxide  increase : A participant  will be withdrawn  from the study 
if the average of two consecutive CO readings during the same vi sit is 100 ppm or 
greater.  
7) Marked  increase  in smoking : A participant  will be withdrawn  from the study  if he/she 
meets BOTH of the following criteria for two consecutive weeks  
a. Cigarette  per day increase:  The average  CPD  increases  by more  than 100% 
from the average CPD during baseline.  
b. Expired  breath  carbon  monoxide  increase:  If the average  of two consecutive  CO 
measurements in the same visit is  
i. CO is greater  than 50 ppm if CO at Baseline  1 is <20 ppm.  
ii. CO is greater than  60 ppm if  CO at Baseline  1 is 20 – 34 ppm.  
iii. CO is greater than  70 ppm if  CO at Baseline  1 is 35 – 49 ppm.  
iv. CO is greater  than 80 ppm if  CO at Baseline  1 is 50 – 64 ppm.  
116  v. CO is greater than  90 ppm if  CO at Baseline  1 is 65 – 80 ppm.  
8) Note:  If the second  consecutive  visit is the last study  visit, then the participant  would  not 
be withdrawn from the study.  
 
The following  will be monitored  and can lead to the participant  being  withdrawn  by the PI 
or Licensed Medical Professional:  
1) Cigarettes per day increase : Continued participation will be evaluated by the site PI if 
the average  number  of cigarettes  per day (CPD)  increases  by more than  100%  from the 
average CPD during baseline as determined by CPD at Baseline 2.  
2) Blood pressure (BP) or heart rate (HR) changes : If any of the following occur post - 
enrollment: 1) BP is at or above 160/100 or below 90/50, or 2) HR is at or above 115 
bpm or below 45 bpm a manual blood pressure and heart rate measurement will be 
taken  after 10 minutes  have  passed.  If the manual  readin g is still out of range,  a ‘Blood 
Pressure and Heart Rate Symptom Checklist’ and ‘Medical Event Form’ will be 
completed, and the participant will be monitored by the medical professional.  
3) Expired breath Carbon Monoxide increase : If the average of two consecutive CO 
measurements  meets  the criteria  below  then the ‘Medical  Event  Form’  will be completed 
and the participant will be monitored by the licensed medical professional.  
a. CO is greater  than 50 ppm if CO at Baseline  1 is <20 ppm.  
b. CO is greater than  60 ppm if  CO at Baseline  1 is 20 – 34 ppm.  
c. CO is greater than  70 ppm if  CO at Baseline  1 is 35 – 49 ppm.  
d. CO is greater  than 80 ppm if CO at Baseline  1 is 50 – 64 ppm.  
e. CO is greater than  90 ppm if  CO at Baseline  1 is 65 – 80 ppm.  
4) Any hospitalization or debilitation in which participation in the study could be detrimental 
to the recovery  process.  This will be self-reported  by the participant  and will be reviewed 
by the site PI and licensed medical professional to determine whether c ontinued 
participation in the study is appropriate.  
5) If a participant is behaving in an inappropriate or threatening manner, admits to lying 
about eligibility criteria, is participating in other smoking research studies that could 
affect  the primary  outcome  measures,  etc., then the PI can withdraw  him/her  from the 
study at the PI’s discretion.  
6) If a participant  fails to attend  regularly  scheduled  research assessment  visits  or comply 
with the research procedures or schedule, then the PI can withdraw him/her from the 
study at the PI’s discretion.  
7) Increase in psychiatric symptoms:  Exacerbation in symptoms noted during the study 
(i.e., change in BDI category from mild to moderate o r moderate to severe) will trigger 
review  by the study’s  licensed  medical  professional.  The PI will withdraw  the participant 
upon the licensed medical professional’s recommendation.  
 
Data  Safety  Monitoring  Board  
A Data and Safety Monitoring  Board (DSMB) ha s been established to monitor safety outcomes 
and will be comprised  of five members.  The DSMB  will be chaired  by Dr. Eden  Evins,  Associate 
Professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School  and Director of the Center for Addiction 
Medicine at Massachusetts General Hospital. Other members include: Kevin Delucchi, PhD., 
Professor in Residence of Biostatistics in Psychiatry at the University of California San 
Francisco and Director of the Quant itative Core of the San Francisco Treatment Research 
Center;  Hendree E.  Jones,  Ph.D.,  Professor  of Obstetrics  and Gynecology  and Director  of UNC 
Horizons at University of North Carolina Chapel Hill; Wallace Pickworth, Ph.D., Research  
117  Leader, Baltimore Operation, Centers for Public Health Research and Evaluation, Battelle; 
Kimber  Richter,  Ph.D.,  M.P.H.,  Associate  Professor  of Preventive  Medicine  and Public  Health  at 
the University of Kansas and Director of the University of Kansas Hospital’s to bacco treatment 
program.  
 
Conflict  of interest  
None  of the members  will be otherwise  affiliated  with the center  and each  member  will complete 
a conflict of interest disclosure form  prior to  each meeting.  Ad hoc specialists may  be invited to 
participate as non -voting members at any time if additional expertise is desired.  
 
Monitoring  activities  and frequency  of meetings  
The DSMB will set their own agenda and decisions about monitoring; e.g. how frequently to 
monitor,  what  threshold  requires  changes  to protocol  or stopping  the study,  and whether  to view 
raw or analyzed data.  The DSMB will be given FDA and EMEA guidelines for DSMBs and 
recent reviews on DSMBs.  A brief report will be generated from each meeting for the study 
record and forwarded to each of the study site’s Institutional Review Boards (IRB) and NIDA’s 
Program  Officer  with the progress  report.  The DSMB  will be available  to convene  outside  of the 
regular meetings, if necessary.  If concerns should arise regarding a particula r subject, or any 
troublesome trends in the experiences of participants, they will make appropriate 
recommendations  for changes  in protocol,  as needed.  The project  investigators  will continue to 
examine safety data, blind to study condition, in case they w ish to make study  
modifications.  Before  modifications  are made,  they will inform  the DSMB  and request  their 
comments.  
 
Communication  plan to IRB, NIDA,  and FDA (if applicable)  
All IRBs,  the FDA and the NIDA’s  Program  Officer  will be informed  of any significant  action 
taken as a result of the Data and Monitoring Board’s findings.  Study Participants will be 
informed of any changes in risk.  
 
Protection  of confidentiality  
For DSMB  meetings  only de-identified  data,  including  blinded  study  site and condition  type,  will 
be provided to the board.  All data and discussion during the meeting will be confidential.  
 
 
Investigational  Tobacco Product  
The Vermont Center on Tobacco and Regulatory Science has received an Investigational 
Tobacco  Product  (ITP)  application  from the FDA to cover  the experimental  cigarettes  being 
used in this study.  This application encompasses both trial sites.  
 
Certificate  of Confidentiality  
To help  protect  the participant’s  privacy,  Dr. Stephen  Higgins,  PhD,  has received  a Certificate  of 
Confidentiality from the National Institutes of Health.  With this certificate, the researchers 
cannot be forced to disclose information that may identify the participants, even by a court 
subpoena, in any federal, state, or local civil, crim inal, administrative, legislative, or other 
proceedings.  The researchers  will use the Certificate to resist  any demands  for information that 
would identify the participants, except as explained below.  The Certificate cannot be used to 
resist  a demand  for information  from personnel  of the United  States  Government  that is used  for 
auditing or evaluation of federally funded projects or for information that must be disclosed in 
order to meet the requirements of the Federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  
118  The Certificate of Confidentiality does not prevent the participant or a member of their family 
from voluntarily  releasing  information  about  themself  and their involvement  in the research.  If 
an insurer, employer  or other person obtains the participant’s written consent to receive 
research information, then the researcher may not use the Certificate to withhold that 
information.  
The Certificate  of Confidentiality  does  not prevent  the researchers  from disclosing  voluntarily, 
without consent, information that would identify the individual  as a participant of the  research 
project in instances such as  evidence of child abuse or a participant's threatened violence to 
self or others.

1. Trial  Objectives  
 
The primary  objective  of this  study  is to evaluate  under  double -blind  conditions  the effects  of 
extended exposure  to cigarettes  varying in  nicotine  content  in adult populations with affective  
disorders,  opioid  use disorder, and socioeconomically disadvantaged women of reproductive age. 
After a baseline period in which daily smoking rate an d other baseline characteristics are 
assessed, participants will be randomly assigned to one of three cigarette conditions for the 12 -
week experimental period.  
2. Trial  Design  
 
This is a randomized,  multi -center,  double -blind,  parallel -groups  design  examining  smokers 
using cigarettes containing 0. 03 mg, 0.12 mg/g or .8 mg machine estimated nicotine  delivery per 
cigarette . The cigarettes used throughout this trial are as follows:

The 0.8 mg dose most  closely  mirrors  the dose level  of conventional  cigarettes,  and will

2.1. Condition Assignment/Randomization  
 
The study consisted of two baseline assessments, separated by one to three weeks, 12 
weeks  of extended  exposure  to research  cigarettes,  with assessments  completed  weekly,  an 
abstinence assessment the day following the Week 12 visit and a final assessment 30 days 
after completing the study.  
Participants were randomly assigned to one of the three nicotine dos es, with 
randomization stratified by site and menthol preference.  The nicotine doses were identified 
by letter code specific to nicotine dose and vulnerable population, and only Administrative 
Core  personnel  with no study -participant  contact  had the link between  the statistician’s  letter 
code and dose assignments.  
Participants  were  recruited  from  the University  of Vermont  (UVM:  all three  vulnerable 
populations),  Johns  Hopkins  University  (JHU:  women  of childbearing age  and individuals 
with opioid use disorder) and Brown University (individuals with affective disorder).  
The final randomization sequences were generated August 10, 2016, but had to be  
revised twice because of an unforeseen shortage of certain doses of the research cigarettes. 
The rando mization  required  two major  types  of assumptions:  1) the proportion  of participants 
recruited from each site, and 2) the proportion of recruited participants at each site who 
smoke menthol/non -menthol cigarettes.  The recruitment goal for this study is 282 people in 
each vulnerable population, with the assumption that 207 of these participants will complete 
the study.  
2.1.1.  Condition  Assignment/Randomization  Adjustments  
 
The initial randomization plan required equal numbers of participants to be 
randomized to each  dose condition.  After this study began, we were informed that three 
of the six cigarettes used in this study would be unavailable for a period of time (the 0.12 
mg non -menthol [NRC 300] and 0.8 mg doses in non -menthol and menthol dose [NRC 
600 & 601]).  At that point, a revised randomization schedule was developed in order to 
continue with the study.  The revised schedule took into consideration the distribution  of 
menthol  and non-menthol  smokers  at each  of the study  sites,  as well as the supply  of 
cigarettes  on-hand  at each site and projected  cigarette  availability.  For the non- menthol 
smokers, this required that we alter the schedule to overemphasize the 0. 03 mg dose 
condition, while for the menthol smokers, an equal number of participants were  
125  randomized  to each of the two doses  that were  readily  available,  with a limited  number  of 
participants randomized to receive the dose in short supply. Randomization using the 
revised schedules began about  seven months into recruitment  and was implemented for a 
period of approximately nine months.  Participants were entered into the study over  a 
period of 2.7 years.  
When the three types of cigarettes again became available, the randomization 
schedule was revised again in order to distribute the remaining participants to achieve 
comparable  sample  sizes  at the end of the study.  For menthol  smoker s, fewer  participants 
were randomized to each of the two doses that had been readily available, and a higher 
number randomized to receive the dose whose supply was previously limited, essentially 
reversing the ratio of randomization to study doses that had  been in effect for the first 
adjustment. Because we were advised that one of the non -menthol cigarette doses would 
be available but insufficient for our estimated remaining needs, an alteration in the dose 
assignment ratios for non -menthol smokers was dev eloped to mitigate, as much as 
possible, a projected imbalance in sample sizes per group. As with the menthol smokers, 
fewer non -menthol smokers are randomized to the dose that had originally been most 
readily available, with randomization to the two remai ning doses emphasizing the dose 
which was now readily available. This newly revised randomization schedule was in 
effect until randomization to the three experimental groups was approximately  
equivalent, at which point the original randomization scheme was  again put in place.  
2.2. Sample  Size 
 
Sample  size was determined  using  a power  analysis  for hypothesis  testing  of the primary 
study aim of the extended exposure study, specifically to detect a significant difference 
between the VLNC conditions and the NNC condition in the primary endpoints, average 
cigarettes/day (CPD) in Week 12 independent of adherence. Donny et al. (2015) found a 
reduction of 4.52 CPD and 6.07 CPD among participants smoking 0.12 mg and 0. 03 mg 
cigarettes, respectively, compared to those smoking NNC. A sample size of 69 completers 
per condition for each vulnerable population will provide 90% power to detect similar 
differences in CPD, with a two -sided type I error rate of 0.02. The type I error rate reflects 
the Bonferroni correction neede d to allow testing of all pair -wise comparisons. The 
recruitment estimate was increased to 282 participants per vulnerable population to 
accommodate the anticipated 26% loss to follow -up over the course of the trial.  
3. Study  Populations  
 
For data analyses, t he full analysis population included participants completing the 
randomization  process.  Participants  were  analyzed  based  upon  the dose to which  they were 
assigned, regardless of protocol violations and/or compliance to condition assignment.  
Participants  not completing  the study  were  excluded  in the analysis  of covariance  models  
126  based  on the data collected  at Week  12, while  all participants  were  included in  analyses 
examining changes over time.  
4. Trial  Endpoints  
 
4.1. Primary  Endpoints  
 
The Primary  Aim of the extended exposure  study  is to compare  the effects  of cigarettes 
varying in nicotine yield on smoking rate. The primary endpoint is average CPD during 
Week 12.  
• CPD  was collected  by daily  Interactive  Voice  Response  (IVR)  to assess  cigarette 
use in the days since the last interview. This yields a continuous record of 
cigarette use throughout the study. A weekly average was obtained for analysis 
by averaging the daily CPD reports.  
 
4.2. Secondary  Endpoints  
 
Additional measures included bre ath carbon monoxide (CO) level, smoking topography, 
urinary cotinine concentration, nicotine dependence (Fagerström Test for Nicotine

5. Statistical  Analysis  
 
5.1. General  Approach  
 
The general  approach  to statistical  analysis  is based  on a general  linear  mixed  model, 
which allows the inclusion of a random effect for study site, a random participant effect 
(between -subject error), and a random error (within -subject error), when appropriate.  
Variance parameters were estimated using restricted maximum likelihood me thod. In the 
event of a statistically significant condition effect, post -hoc tests were conducted in order to 
explore  the nature  of the significant  findings. First,  the lowest  nicotine  content  condition  was 
compared to the NNC condition (0.8 mg); if signif icant differences were observed (p <  
128  0.05),  all pairwise  comparisons  were  conducted  using  a Bonferroni  multiple  comparison 
adjustment.  
This study was conducted in three different vulnerable populations under a similar 
protocol, with differences between protocols consisting of data collection specific to that 
vulnerable population. This included information such as use and timing of opioid 
maintenance therapy for individuals with opioid -use disorder or additional assessments of 
anxiety  and depression for individuals with affective disorders. In order to explore potential 
differences across individuals with different vulnerabilities, data from all three studies were 
combined  for analysis.  A vulnerable  population -by-condition  or populatio n-by- condition -by- 
time interaction term was included in all analyses. In the event that these interaction terms 
were statistically significant, all pairwise comparisons were conducted using a Bonferroni 
multiple comparison adjustment.  
Transformations (in cluding log, square root, etc.) were performed as needed so that 
ANOVA model assumptions of normality and equal variances hold. Geometric means in 
original  units  were  calculated as  well.  Note that  not all outcomes  are assessed  at weekly  in- 
person visits. The time points at which each outcome is assessed is described in Section 6.  
5.2. Describing  the Study Population  
5.2.1.  Baseline  Characteristics  
 
Baseline characteristics, including demographics and smoking characteristics, were 
compared among conditions to identify any imbalances after randomization.  Discrete 
variable are summarized by frequencies and percentages and compared using the Chi - 
squared Test or Fisher’s Exact Test, as appropriate.  Continuous variables are 
summarized  by the mean  and standard  devia tion, and compared  using  a one-way analysis 
of variance (ANOVA).  These analyses include a random effect for study site.  In the 
event that statistically significant differences are found, these baseline characteristics are 
included as fixed effects in all subsequent analyses.  
5.2.2.  Randomization  Effects  
 
While we do not expect participant characteristics or responses to change according 
to the time of entry into this study, we examined the effect of randomization scheme on 
baseline  characteristics,  with the independent  variable  being  the randomization  scheme in 
place at the time of study entry, categorized as original, first adjustment, and second 
adjustment, including a random effect for study site.  In the event that statistically 
significant differences in any of these variables were found, they were to b e included as 
fixed effects in all subsequent analyses.  As menthol status was the only variable that 
differed because of the randomization scheme, it was included as a covariate in all 
analyses.  
129  5.3. Primary  Endpoint  Analysis  
 
5.3.1.  Primary  Analysis  
 
The primary endpoint was differences among dose conditions in total CPD during 
Week  12. Data  analysis is  an analysis  of co-variance,  with condition  as the independent 
variable, and the baseline value of that variable included as a covariate.  In addition, 
vulnerable population, sex, age, and menthol status were included as fixed effects and 
study site as a random effect.  
5.3.2.  Secondary  Analysis  
 
As noted above, the CPD outcomes were assessed daily using the IVR system, with 
results  reported as  the mean  CPD  averaged  over seven  days.  A growth  curve  was used to 
examine the trajectory of changes over the twelve weeks of the trial.  Variance 
parameters  were  estimated  using  the restricted  maximum  likelihood  method,  assuming  an 
unstructured covariance matrix.  The mo dels contained dose condition, time, vulnerable 
population, and  the three -way interaction  of vulnerable  population -by-condition -by-time, 
as well as all appropriate two -way interactions.  In addition, the baseline CPD was 
included as a covariate as well as s ex, age, and menthol status.  In the event that the  
three -way interaction  was statistically  significant,  post-hoc tests were  used to examine  the 
exact nature of the differences, as outlined above.  If the three -way interaction was not 
statistically significant, it was dropped from the model, and the analysis proceeded 
examining each of the two -way interactions in turn, with the primary effect of interest 
being the condition -by-time interaction.  If no ne of the interactions were statistically 
significant, all were eliminated from the model, and the analysis was repeated, limited to 
the main effects of condition and time, as well as the covariates noted above.  
 
 
5.4. Secondary Endpoint Analysis  
 
The majority of secondary endpoints were examined in a manner similar to that 
described for primary endpoints described above.  For outcomes measured weekly or 
every two weeks, a growth curve was used to examine the trajectory of changes over the 
twelve weeks o f the trial.  Variance parameters were estimated using the restricted 
maximum  likelihood  method,  assuming  an unstructured  covariance  matrix.  For outcomes 
measured less frequently, repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used 
using the restricted maximum likelihood method, with the structure of the covariance 
matrix assume  to be compound symmetric.  The choice  of this structure  was based on the 
value of the fit statistics, and the same covariance structure was assumed for all repeated 
measures ANOVA models, unless the model failed to converge.  In that case, alternate 
assumptions were used to obtain a final model.  
130  All models contained dose condition, time, vulnerable population, and the three -way 
interaction  of vulnerable  population -by-condition -by-time,  as well as all appropriate  two- 
way interactions.  The baseline  value  of that  particular variable  was also be  includ ed as a 
covariate in the model, when available, as well as sex, age, and menthol status.  
Interactions  were  deleted  from  the model  as describe  above  for the Primary  Endpoint 
Analysis.  
Outcome variables for which a transformation would not result in normally 
distributed data were also examined, including the number of days participants were 
abstinent throughout the 12 -week trial and whether participants were able to maintain 
abstinence  at the abstinence  visit following  the Week -12 visit,  or whether  they attempted 
to quit either throughout the trial or at the 30 -day follow -up. Zero-inflated negative 
binomial regression was used to examine the number of days on which participants 
reported  smoking  no study  or non-study cigarettes.  The baseline  CPD  was included as  a 
covariate  in this analysis, along with vulnerable  population, sex, age  and menthol  status. 
Logistic regression was used to examine the abstinence and quit attempts, with the 
models  including vulnerable population, sex, age and menthol status as covariates.  
5.5. Missing  Data  
 
We tested the pattern of missing values using Little’s MCAR test, with the results 
suggesting that data were missing at random.  Thus, we employed statistical procedures 
based on maximum likelihood estimates, which allows the inclusion of all subjects without 
imputation of missing values. The maximum likelihood approach estimates the parameter 
values that would maximize the probability of observing t he data collected. In the event of 
missing variables, the likelihood for a given individual is the probability of observing the 
non-missing variables. Thus, the maximum likelihood approach allows the use of data from 
participants  for the time period  for which data is available,  but not for time periods  for which 
the data is missing.  This procedure  uses information from  earlier  time periods  to estimate  the 
effects  of later time periods,  while also  accounting  for the uncertainty  of the projection  in the 
computation of standard errors and test statistics.  
While maximum likelihood estimation is considered superior to imputation methods for 
the treatment of missing data in clinical trials, additional analyses were conducted for the 
primary outcomes of total and study CPD at the 12 -week time -point using multiple 
imputation  with the  Markov  Chain  Monte  Carlo  (MCMC)  method  carried  out in PROC  MI in 
SAS.  A total of 100 imputed data sets were generated, with the condition effect assessed in 
each imputed data set. A final single assessment of experimental condition differences was 
obtained by combining the  results across the  imputed datasets using PROC MIANALYZE  in 
SAS. The results of these analyses were compared to the primary analysis to evaluate the 
robustne ss of our conclusions.  
131  6. Safety  
 
Safety  data included  the number  of adverse  events,  classified  as to category,  based  on the 
Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). In addition to the type of event, 
adverse  events  were  categorized  by severity  and whether  the adverse  event  was related  to the 
study products/procedures.  
Summary frequencies were provided based on the overall number of events as well as 
separatel y by dose condition. In addition to the number of events of a particular type recorded, 
the percent of adverse events were computed with the denominator being the number of 
participants in the safety population. Thus, the description of events are reported  as 
events/person.  The number  of adverse  events  was compared  across  conditions  using  zero-inflated 
negative binomial regression, including a random effect for study site.  
7. Interim  Analyses  
 
No interim  analyses  were  conducted.  
 
8. Reporting  Conventions  
 
P-values  less than 0.05 were  considered  as statistically  significant.  Statistically  significant 
p-values greater than or equal to 0.001 are reported to three decimals places; those less than  
0.001  will be reported  as <0.001.  Non-significant  p-values  are reported  to two  decimal  places. 
The mean, standard deviation, standard error, and other statistics are reported to one decimal 
place greater than the original value.  Quantiles such as median, minimum and maximum will 
use the same number of decimal places as the original data. Estimated parameters not on the 
same scale as the raw observations, such as regression coefficients, are reported to two 
significant digits.  
For the most part, statistical analyses were performed using SAS, version 9.4.  Data 
management  and cleaning  were  performed  using tools available  in REDCap,  R and SAS,  version 
9.4.

 CNI-Free GVHD Prophylaxis Protocol – 1301  
Version 4.0 dated June 22, 2017  
 
 
ii PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS  
 
A Randomized, Multi -Center, Phase III Trial of Calcineurin Inhibitor -Free Interventions  
for Prevention of Graft -versus Host -Disease  
 
Co-Principal Investigators : Leo Luznik, Miguel -Angel Perales, Marcelo Pasquini  
 
Study Design:  The study is designed as a three arm randomized Phase III, 
multicenter trial comparing two calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) -free 
strategies for GVHD prophylaxis to sta ndard calcineurin 
inhibitor tacrolimus and methotrexate (Tac/Mtx) in patients with acute leukemia or myelodysplasia undergoing myeloablative 
conditioning hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.  
 
Primary Objective:  The primary objective of the randomized t rial is to compare 
chronic GVHD/relapse- free survival [CRFS] as a time to event 
endpoint  after hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT ) 
between each of the CNI-free interventions  and a Tac/Mtx 
control.  
 
Secondary Objectives : Secondary o bjectives are: comparison of rates of grade II -IV and 
III-IV acute GVHD, chronic GVHD, chronic GVHD -free 
survival, immunosuppression- free survival at  one year, primary 
and secondary graft failure, neutrophil and platelet engraftment, 
disease relapse, trans plant -related mortality, rate s of Grade ≥ 3 
toxicity according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 4.0; incidence of  CMV  and 
EBV reactivation, incidence of  infections; immune 
reconstitution, quality of life  and overall sur vival.  
 
Eligibility Criteria:  Patients ≥  1 year and < 66 years undergoing HSCT for treatment 
of acu te leukemia  in morphologic complete remission with or 
without hematologic recovery  or myelodysplasia  with < 5% 
blasts in the marrow and no circulating blasts , and who are 
eligible for  a myeloablative allogeneic transplant . Patients with 
CMML  must have a WB C count ≤  10,000 cells/µL and <  5% 
blasts in the marrow . Patients with >  5% blasts due to a 
regenerating marrow must contact the protocol chairs for review. Patients must have a related or unrelated donor. Related donor must be an 8/8 match for HLA -A, -B and - C at intermediate (or 
higher) resolution, and - DRB1 at high resolution using DNA -
based typing. Pediatric related donors  must weigh ≥ 25.0 kg, must 
have adequate peripheral venous catheter access for leukapheresis or must agree to placement of a central catheter, must be willing to (1) donate bone marrow  and (2) receive G -CSF

iii followed by donation of  peripheral blood stem cells  (product to 
be determined by randomization post enrollment) , and must meet 
institutional criteria for donation.  Unrelated donor must be an 8/8 
match at HLA -A, -B, -C and –DRB1 at high resolution using 
DNA- based typing. Unrelated donor must be medically el igible 
to donate according to NMDP (or equivalent donor search organization) criteria. At time of enrollment, the donor should not have any known preferences or contraindications to donate bone 
marrow or peripheral blood stem cells .  
 
Treatment Description : Patients will be randomized to receive one of the three specified 
interventions: 1) CD34 selected T -cell depleted peripheral blood 
stem cell (PBSC) graft; 2) unma nipulated bone marrow (BM) 
graft followed by cyclophosphamide (Cy) 50mg/kg Day  +3 and 
+4 pos t HSCT ; or, 3) unmanipulated BM  graft with Tac/Mtx 
GVHD prophylaxis.  Tac will be maintained at therapeutic doses 
for a minimum of 90 days. Methotrexate will be dosed at 10-
15mg/m
2 for a maximum of 4 doses post -transplant .   
 
Accrual Objective:  The clinical  trial will enroll 345 patients or 115  per arm, in an 
adaptive design for futility  evaluated at time of interim analysis.  
 Accrual Period:  The estimated accrual period is 42 months.  
 Study Duration:  Patients will be followed for 2 years following hematopoietic cell 
transplantation .
 
 
Interim Analysis:  No formal interim analyses for efficacy will be used. There is also not included in the design an option for closure of the control group while keeping the two treatment arms open, in the event that at  least one of the treatments demonstrate early efficacy. 
Interim analyses for futility will be conducted at times coincident with regularly scheduled meetings of the DSMB, starting when approximately 45 -50% of the targeted number of events have 
been observ ed. 
 
Stopping Guidelines:  Monitoring of a key safety endpoint (mortality) will be conducted 
monthly up to 100 days post -randomization separately in each of 
the three treatment arms. At least three events must be observed in order to trigger review. 
 
Correl ative Studies:  Comparison of immune reconstitution using a panel of clinically 
available tests across all treatment arms.  Advanced immune 
reconstitution assays.

survival after transplant compared to standard Tac/Mtx control.  
 
Inclusion Criteria  
1. Males and females age d ≥ 1.0 year and  < 66.0 years  
2. Patients with acute leukemia, in morphologic complete 
remission  with or without hematologic recovery or 
myelodysplasia with <  5% blasts in the marrow and no

1. BACKGROUND AND RATIO NALE  
 1.1. Introduction 
 
Chronic graft versus host disease (GVHD) is a devastating complication that affect s hematopoietic 
cell transplant (HCT) survivors and may offset the associated benefits of reducing rates of  post-
transplant  disease relaps e.
1, 2 GVHD prevention regimens are a required component of any 
allogeneic HCT approach , and most commonly use  a combination of immunos uppressive agents 
given for the first 6 months after  transplant. Often, patients develop GVHD and continue on these 
agents for much longer periods. The combination of calcineurin inhibitors (tacrolimus and 
cyclosporine A) with methotrexate (MTX) is the mos t common GVHD prophylaxis used 
worldwide in the context of myeloablative conditioning transplant s. This regimen , implemented 
more than 3 decades ago , demonstrated better control of acute GVHD .3 ,4 However, this strategy 
is ineffective against chronic GVHD. Management of chronic GVHD  remains a challenge and it 
has become a significant health problem in transplant survivors with more frequent use of 
mobilized peripheral blood stem cells.  Additionally, several issues arise with this treatment 
approach including: 1) MTX accentuated risk of conditioning regimen- related oral mucositis and 
renal toxicity ; 2) Increased risk of thrombotic microangiopathy due to CNI; 3) Requirement for 
chronic monitoring of CNI serum levels ; and, 4) Chronic immunosuppression is not a conducive 
platform for post HCT cellular therapies for treatment or prevention of infections or disease 
relapse.  
 
In vivo  graft manipulation with anti thymocyte globulin (ATG)5, 6 or alemtuzumab,7 , 8, 9 ex vivo 
graft manipul ation with CD34 selection and T -cell depletion10 and, most recently , use of high 
doses of cyclophosphamide after transplant ( PTCy ) are strategies that are associated with lower  
rates  of chronic GVHD.  In addition a  benchmark analysis of novel approaches to prevent GVHD 
using data from the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplantation Research (CIBMTR) identified two strategies for T -cell depletion using either CD34 -selection or 
administration of post -transplantation Cy cyclophosphamide ( PTCy ) as the most effective in 
preventin g both a cute and chronic GVHD after H CT. This clinical trial further explores these 
approaches to prevent chronic GVHD that have the additional benefit of not requiring prolonged 
immunosuppression.   
1.2. CD34+ Selection and T -Cell Depletion  
 
The recognition that GVHD i s mediated by donor derived T -cells led to pre -clinical and clinical 
exploration of T -cell depletion to reduce the risk of GVHD.  The use of ex vivo  T-cell depleted 
(TCD) grafts has significantly reduced the risk of GVHD without the need for post -transplant 
immunosuppression.
11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18 Although several different approaches have been used 
over the yea rs, more recently, removal of T -cells fr om the graft has been achieved through positive 
selection of CD34+ cells using immunomagnetic beads.12, 13, 14, 18, 19, 20, 21 In earlier studies, CD34+ 
selection of PBSCs was performed on the IS OLEX 300i magnetic cell selection system (Baxter, 
 CNI-Free GVHD Prophylaxis Protocol – 1301  
Version 4.0 dated June 22, 2017  
 
 
1-2 Deerfield, IL), followed by E -rosetting.12, 13, 20 Current studies are using super -paramagnetic 
particle -conjugated antibodies  on the CliniMACS Cell Separation  System (Miltenyi Biotec, 
Gladbach, Germany) for CD34+ selection.14, 20, 21 The CliniMACS System  can also be used to 
negatively select grafts throug h depletion of CD3 and CD19 cells or depletion of TCR αβ T-cells.22 
When assessing data from clinical trials reporting the use of TCD grafts it is critical to review the specific approach used.  The degree of T -cell depletion is a particularly critical factor . In recipients 
of TCD marrow grafts from HLA -identical donors, the risk of GVHD was shown to increase if the 
graft contained > 1x10
5 T-cells/kg.23 For example, the CliniMACS System  can achieve a 5 -log 
reduction in T -cells, whereas the ISOLEX 300i system  (no longer available in the US) achieves a 
3.5- to 5 log reduction, depending on the settings, and may requir e additional T -cell depletion 
through E -rosetting  in the case of the lower log reduction . The CliniMACS® CD34 Reagent 
System was approved as a hum anitarian device and authorized by U.S. Federal law for use in the 
treatment of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in first complete remission.  The effectiveness of the device for this use has not been demonstrated.  
 1.2.1. Both A cute and Chronic GVHD ar e Decreased  
 The main goal of using a TCD or CD34- selected graft s is to reduce the risk of both acute and 
chronic GVHD.  This result has been achieved in most studies, although to varying degrees. The 
risk of GVHD generally has correlated with the extent of  T-cell depletion.  The risk of both acute 
and chronic GVHD decreases significantly when the degree of T -cell depletion is 3 -log using bone 
marrow or 4 -5 log using PBSC.
11, 12, 13, 14, 18, 24, 25 For example, studies perf ormed at MSKCC that 
achieved a 5 -log reduction in T -cells using CD34- selection followed by E -rosetting have reported 
incidences of acute GVHD (limited to grade II) of 8%, and chronic GVHD of 9% in recipients of matched related grafts and incidences of acut e and chronic GVHD of 9% and 29%, respectively, 
in recipients of matched unrelated donors.
12, 13 None of the patients received GVHD prophylaxis 
beyond T -cell depletion of the graft.  Results from single -center studies have been validated in 
BMT CTN 0303 in which 44 patients with AML in CR 1 or CR2 were conditioned with TBI, 
thiotepa, and cyclophosphamide with rabbit ATG followed by a single step TCD, PBSC allogeneic 
graft from an HLA -identical sibling donor. The incidence of acute GVHD grade II -IV was 22.7%, 
and the incidence of extensive c hronic GVHD was 6.8% at 24 months .14 Importantly, these results 
are in the setting of peripheral blood stem cell grafts.  
 
1.2.2. CD34 Selection  Impact on  Graft Rejection and Relapse 
 
A potential consequence of T -cell depletion is a higher risk of graft rejection.  In fact, early studies 
of T-cell depletion were associated with higher rates of graft rejection than observed in recipients 
of conventional graft s, with reported graft failure rates as high as 27%.26, 27, 28 These clinical results 
confirmed pre -clinical data that donor -derived T-cells facilitate engraftment.  Following 
modifications of the conditioning regimen, and in particular the use of ATG to promote engraftment, several centers have reported consistent engraftment with TCD grafts using a variety of approaches for T -cell depletion, including CD34- selection.
11, 12, 13, 14, 24, 25  
 
Another potential and significant limitation of T -cell depleting the graft is an increase in relapse, 
due to elimination of the recognition of the tumor by donor -derived T-cells, the so- called graft

1-3 versus leukemia (GVL) effect.  This was illustrated in patients with CML, where a retrospective 
study of 46 patients who underwent TCD transplants were compared to 40 patients who had conventional grafts.
29 The 3 -year probability of relapse was higher in the TCD group than in the 
non-TCD group (62% v 24%, p = .0003).  After donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI), however, 17 of 
20 patients in the TCD group and 2 of 3 patients in the non- TCD group achieved a complete 
remission.  While the CML experience clearly supports the critical role of GVL in allogeneic HCT, 
results in studies with patients with AML or ALL report comparable low rates of relapse after TCD HCT.
11, 12, 13, 14, 17, 18 For example, in the BMT CTN 0303 study, the relapse rate for patients with 
AML in CR1 was 17.4% at 36 months.14 The MSKCC group recently reported  results in 56 adult 
patients with ALL, including 27 patients in CR1, 18 in CR2, 11 in CR3 or greater.17 With a median 
follow -up of 6.1 ye ars, the cumulative incidence of relapse for the entire cohort was 23% . These 
results are consistent with those reported by the Perugia group who found a probability of relapse 
of 0.12 for patients with AML and 0.28 for patients with ALL who underwent TCD HCT in CR1 
or CR2.25 To further assess the impact of T -cell depletion on relapse in patients with AML in CR1, 
a retrospective analysis of 115 patients who received TCD grafts after ab lative conditioning at 
MSKCC were  compared to a cohort of 181 patients who received unmodified grafts after 
conditioning with busulfan/ fludarabine and GVHD prophylaxis with tacrolimus/ mini -
methotrexate at MD Ander son Cancer Center (MDACC).18 There were no significant differences 
in the rate of relapse at 3 years between TCD and unmodified graft recipients ( 18% vs. 25%, p= 
0.3).  
 
1.2.3. Immune R econstitution after CD34 Selection  
 Allogeneic HCT is associated with deficiencies in the recovery of T and B cells that are associated 
with increased rates of infections,
30, 31, 32, 33 disease relapse,34 and the development of s econdary 
malignancies.35 While several factors contribute to these immune defects, the use of either in vivo  
(with alemtuzumab or ATG) or ex vivo  T-cell depletion has marked effects on immune recovery. 6, 
7, 8, 9, 30, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41 Studies of thymic output have shown lower T -cell receptor rearrangement 
excision circles (TRECs) in recipients of TCD allografts compared to unmodified allograft 
recipients.41 These differences, however, abated beyond 9 months. Delayed thymic output 
translates into delayed recovery of total and naïve CD4+ T -cells, prolonged inversion of the 
CD4/CD 8 ratio, and delayed recovery of T -cell mitogen responses, which is associated with an 
increase in Epstein -Barr Virus -Associated Lymphoproliferative disorders and opportunistic 
infections in the first year post -transplant.30, 40 Studies of T -cell receptor (TCR) diversity in allo -
HCT patients using 5’ -RACE PCR with deep sequencing have shown more rapid recovery in 
diversity in recipients of conventional grafts compared to TCD grafts.42 It should be noted, 
however, that GVHD also has a significant impact on immune recovery through direct effects on the thymus,
43, 44 and particularly because of the immunosuppressive drugs required to treat 
GVHD.45, 46, 47, 48, 49 In the MSKCC/MDACC retrospective study, 6 (5%) and 2 (1%) patients died 
of infections within 100 days post -transplant, in the TCD and unmodified groups (p=0.04), 
respectively.18 Despite these differences in infectious deaths, there were no sig nificant differences 
in three -year relapse -free (RFS) and overall survival (OS) rates.

1-4 1.2.4. Advantages of CD34 - Selection  
 The main advantage of the use of a CD34 -selected graft is the significant reduction in acute and 
chronic GVHD.  This is particularly relevant in patients who do not have a fully matched donor. 
Another advantage of CD34- selected grafts is the fact that no post -transplant GVHD prophylaxis 
is required. The ability to avoid CNI  eliminates the renal toxicity associated with their use in allo -
HCT therefore allows inclusion of patients with underlying renal dysfuncti on, including older 
patients.  The lack of CNI  increases the ability to use ablative regimens in older patients where the 
combined toxicity of an ablative regimen and post -transplant GVHD prophylaxis that includes a 
CNI and methotrexate represents a dose limiting toxicity.  As a result, older patients receiving 
conventional grafts are typically treated with reduced intensity or non- ablative conditioning 
regimens, which are associated with higher rates of relapse in acute leukemias.  Finally, the use of 
a CD34 -selected graft also represents the ideal plat form for post -transplant immunotherapy with 
adoptive cell therapy targeting minimal residual disease.  This approach has the potential advantage 
of overcoming any loss of GVL without affecting the benefit of reduced GVHD.  
 T-cell depletion has now been under investigation for over 3 decades with few studies comparing 
outcomes  with patients receiving unmodified grafts.  As noted above, results from the 
MSKCC/MDACC comparative study demonstrated similar RFS and OS after TCD and conventional transplants from related/unrelated donors in patients with AML in CR1, but a significant r eduction in GVHD in the TCD cohort.
18 A prior retrospective study of 146 patients 
with hematological malignancies did not show significant differen ces in  survival, GVHD rates, 
and quality of life between patients who received TCD and unmodified grafts, although the method 
of T-cell depletion used only achieved a 1 -2 log reduction in T -cells.50 In the only prospective 
randomized phase II -III trial, the  
incidence of acute GVHD was 
lower after TCD -HCT, but there 
was no difference in survival.51 
This study also used older methods of T -cell depletion that 
only achieved 1 -  2 logs of 
depletion. A recent analysis of the 
BMT CTN 0303 patients compared to a subs et of patients 
on BMT CTN 0101 who received a conventional transplant for AML in CR1/CR2 showed no differences in rates of graft rejection, leukemia relapse, transplant -related mortality 
(TRM ), and disease -free and overall survival rates.
10 Two-year rates of chronic GVHD were lower 
with TCD grafts than conventional grafts (19% v 50%, respectively; P < .001) and TCD was associated with a higher GVHD -free survival at 2 years (41% v 19%; P = .006).

1-5 1.3. Post-Transplant Cyclophosphamide  
 1.3.1. Rationale of Post -Transplant Cyclophosphamide  
 High -dose cyclophosphamide is a potent immunomodulatory agent that has been successfully used 
to prevent GVHD in HLA -matched and –mismatched setting in several single -center as well as in 
multi- center studies.  Preclinical studies have shown that cyclophosphamide administered early 
post HSCT preferentially kills activated, cycling allo -reactive T -cells while sparing resting, non 
allo-reactive T -cells leading to suppression of GVHD as well as graft rejection.
52, 53 Furthermore, 
a recent study showed that human regulatory T cells are resistant to post -transplant 
cyclophosphamide (PTCy) and contribute to its GVHD preventive effects.54  
 1.3.2. Post-Transplant  Cyclophosphamide in Haploidentical Donor Transplants  
 Based on promising pre -clinical results at Johns Hopkins, a Phase I/II clinical trial of 
haploidentical HCT to treat high -risk hematologic malign ancies was initiated in 1999.
52, 53 
Following a non -myelo ablative regimen of fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and low -dose TBI , 
GVHD prophylaxis consisted of cyclophosphamide (Cy) given on D ays +3 and +4 post -transplant, 
tacrolimus, and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF).41 Primary graft failure occurred in 13% of 
patients, and was fatal due to infection in one patient in wh om autologous hematopoiesis failed to 
occur.  In general, complete T -cell engraftment was observed by D ay +28 or  the grafts were 
rejected.  Cumulative incidences of grades II -IV and grades III -IV acute GVHD by D ay 200 w ere 
34% and 6%, respectively. There was lower incidence of extensive chronic GVHD among 
recipients of two versus one dose of post -transplantation Cy ( 5% versus 25%; p= 0.05). There was 
no difference in the incidence of severe acute GVHD with one or two doses of post -transplant Cy.  
The cumulative incidences of non -relapse mortality and relapse at 1 year were 15% and 51%, 
respectively.  Actuarial overall an d event -free survivals (EFS) at two years after transplantation 
were 36% and 26%, respectively. Patients with lymphoid malignancies appeared to have an 
improved EFS compared to those with myeloid malignancies (p= 0.02).  
 The BMT CTN sponsored a multi -center Phase II trial of haploidentical BMT ( BMT CTN 0603) 
for high -risk hematologic malignancies modeled after the Hopkins approach. This was published 
along with a similar study using double umbilical cord blood (dUCB) grafts without post-
transplant  Cy (BMT CTN 0604) .
39 The 1 -year probabilities of overall and progression- free 
survival were 54% and 46% after dUCB  
transplan tation and 
62% and 48% after haploidentical bone marrow  HCT . The Day 
+56 cumulative incidence of neutrophil recovery was 94% after 
dUCB and 96% after haploidentical marrow.

donor transplants in the BMT CTN 0603 clinical trial.  Figure 1.3.2: Treatment schema of patients undergoing haploidentical  
donor transplants in the BMT CTN 0603 clinical trial.  
 CNI-Free GVHD Prophylaxis Protocol – 1301  
Version 4.0 dated June 22, 2017  
 
 
1-6 The 100- day cumulative incidence of grade II -IV acute GVHD was 40% with dUCB  and 32% 
with haploidentical bone marrow. The 1 -year cumulative incidences of non -relapse mortality and 
relapse after cord transplantation were 24% and 31% , respectively ; corresponding rates after 
haploidentical bone marrow transplantation were 7% and 45%.  
 Several other centers have reported studies using PTCy to facilitate haploidentical transplantation in the myeloablative conditioning setting.
55 56 57 58 The outcomes reported with these studies are 
consistent with the low NRM seen in studies of non- myeloablative T -cell replete haploidentical 
donor transplantation performed using PTCy as well as consistently low rates of severe acute and 
chronic GVHD.  
 
To date, haploidentical non- myeloablative transplantation with post -transplant Cy has used bone 
marrow as the graft source.  Use of PBSC instead of marrow may allow wider applicability of this 
approach but there is concern about higher risks of acute and chronic GVHD due to the 5 -10-fold 
higher number of T -cells in the allograft.  Recently, groups in Atlanta and Se attle/London reported 
small studies  in which PBSC were substituted for bone marrow with post -transplant Cy in the 
haploidentical donor setting.59 60 In both studies, PBSC was used for HLA -haploidentical HCT 
with PTCy with overall outcomes of severe acute GVHD, chronic GVHD, and non- relapse 
mortality at 1 year with HLA -matched related or unrelated HCT.  
 A number of studies accompanying clinical trials of haploidentical HCT with post -transplant Cy 
have been performed. Kasamon et al. looked at the effect of HLA disparity on transplant outcomes 
in a retrospective analysis of 185 patients transplanted in Baltimore.
61 No association was found 
between the degr ee of mismatching at 5 HLA loci and the risk of acute GvHD or NRM. A 
retrospective study by Burroughs, et al.,62 compared the outcomes of patients with relapsed 
Hodgkin lymphoma (92% of whom had failed autologous transplants) who had undergone nonablative c onditioning and transplantation with either haploidentical donors or HLA -matched 
related or unrelated donors in Baltimore or Seattle.  GvHD prophylaxis after transplantation with 
matched donors was a calcineurin inhibitor plus MMF. Although the number of pa tients in each 
group was relatively small, it appeared that outcomes after haploidentical transplantation were no worse and possibly better than those after transplantation from matched donors. Two year NRM 
was similar for haploidentical and unrelated dono rs (9% and 8%, respectively) compared to 21% 
for related donors. EFS at 2 years was 51% for haploidentical donors compared to 23% and 29% for related and unrelated donors, respectively. The finding of similar outcomes after haploidentical 
HCT using PTCy co mpared with matched related or unrelated donors for a variety of hematologic 
malignancies was also recently reported.
63  
 1.3.3. PTCy  in HLA Matched Donor  
 Given the success of PTCy  in the prevention of GVHD in the setting of haploidentical 
transplantation, Luznik et al.
64 reported a large study of patients who underwent allogeneic HCT  
from HLA -matched donors after myeloablative conditioning using busulfan- cyclophosphamide 
(BuCy) and PTCy  as a single agent for prophylaxis of GvHD. A total of 117 patients with high -
risk hematologic malignancies were transplanted from 78 related or 39 unrelated donors. Half of 
the patients were not in remission at the time of transplant.  Bone marrow grafts were used for all 
 CNI-Free GVHD Prophylaxis Protocol – 1301  
Version 4.0 dated June 22, 2017  
 
 
1-7 patients. The incidence of G VHD was remarkably low (4 3% grades  II-IV acute, 10% grades III/IV 
acute, 10% chronic) showing the effectiveness of the approach (Figure 1.3.2). There was no 
difference in the incidence of acute or chronic G VHD between related or unrelated donors. Almost 
two-thirds of the patients did not r equire any additional immunosuppressive therapy after post -
transplant Cy. Patients who did develop G VHD responded to steroids alone in 20% of cases or 
steroids plus a second agent (calcineurin or non- calcineurin) in 75% of cases.  Rates of grade II -IV 
acute and chronic GVHD were both 10% (Figure 1.3.2). Observed rates of non- relapse mortality 
and disease relapse were 20% and 44%, respectively.  This study showed that post -transplant Cy 
was effective as a single -agent to prevent severe acute or chronic GVHD in  the vast majority of 
patients undergoing myeloablative transplantation from matched donors. Only 3% of deaths were due to infection suggesting that immune reconstitution is robust in such patients. Obviating the 
need for ongoing immunosuppression post -transplant provides an optimal platform for cellular 
therapy to prevent or treat relapsed disease.    
 
These encouraging outcomes with PTCy in prevention of GVHD were recently reproduced in a multi- institutional study that effectively combined this novel single -agent short -course GVHD 
prevention strategy in combination with IV Bu/Flu myeloablative conditioning.  In this study, 92 
adult patients (median age 49, range 21- 65) with high- risk hematologic malignancies were enrolled 
at three centers.  Forty -five (49%) p atients received related allografts, and 47 (51%) received 
unrelated allografts.  GVHD prophylaxis was solely with PTCy at 50 mg/kg/day on post -transplant 
days +3 and +4 after bone marrow allografting. The cumulative incidences of grade II -IV acute, 
grade I II-IV acute, and chronic GVHD were 51%, 15%, and 14%, respectively. Non-relapse 
mortality (NRM) at 100 days and 1 year were 9% and 16%, respectively. With a 2.2 year median 
follow -up, the two -year event -free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) were 62 % and 67%, 
respectively.  Donor type did not impact on NRM, EFS, or OS. Patients in complete remission (CR) 
without evidence of minimal residual disease had remarkably high rates of EFS (80%) and OS (79%).  The results obtained in these two studies serve as the basis for the PTCy CNI -free strategy 
in this clinical trial.

1-8 1.3.4. Immune R econstitution after PTCy  
 The ability to shorten the duration of post -grafting immunosuppression after HLA -matched allo -
HSCT with PTCy was marked by prompt immune reconstitution and a low incidence of opportunistic infections. Among 47 patients studied immunophenotypically after HLA -matched 
HCT the mean CD4
+ T cell count on day 30 was 98 cells  μl and on day 60 was 124 cells/μl.54 At 
both days 30 and 60 after HCT, the CD8+ T cell counts were already within the normal range.  
Effector regulatory T cells rapidly recovered to donor levels by 30 days after HCT, and there was favorable memory CD4
+ T cell recovery compared with naïve CD4+ T cells.  
 
In both studies detailed in section 1.3.3. above, no patients died of CMV or inva sive fungal 
infection. Reactivation of CMV occurred in 29% of patients, and there were only two documented 
cases of CMV disease. The rapid recovery of CMV -specific immunity correlated with the results 
of in vitro  ELISPOT assays.  The frequency of cells secr eting interferon gamma in response to 
stimulation with pentadecapeptides of the immunodominant CMV protein, pp65, at day 30–60 after allo -HSCT did not differ from pre -transplantation specimens from CMV -seropositive 
donor/recipient pairs. The absence of pos t-transplantation Epstein– Barr virus -associated 
lymphoproliferative disease is another indicator of the prompt immunologic recovery seen with post-transplant Cy . 
65 
 
1.4. Benchmark Analysis and Composite Endpoint  
 
In order to better evaluate the efficacy of novel approaches for GVHD prophylaxis, a benchmark analysis was performed using data from the  Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant 
Research  (CIBMTR ) for patients who received standard CNI based GVHD prophylaxis with 
tacrolimus and MTX .  
 The CIBMTR maintains an outcomes registry that prospectively collects data from all centers 
performing allogeneic H CTs and almost all centers performing autologous H CTs in the United 
States in addition to about 100 non- US centers.  Centers must report all con secutive patients and 
provide longitudinal follow -up on those patients according to set timelines that include a pre -
transplant  report, a 100 day  report , a 6 month report and an annual report through 6 years post -
transplant  followed by a biannual report in perpetuity. Dat a are reported on two tracks: a 
“Transplant Essential Data” track and a “Comprehensive Report Form” track.  Centers provide a 
pre-transplant  Transplant Essential Data form for all patients . Data from this form are used to select 
patients for  the Comprehensive Report Form track using a weighted random selection that over 
selects  patients with rare diseases or procedures or for the purposes of specific studies. For 
example, most patients on BMT CTN trials are selected for the Comprehensive Repo rt Form track 
so that data collected by the CIBMTR can supplement clinical trial data collected through AdvantageEDC
SM and can allow for long -term follow -up of trial patients for specific late effects 
of treatment.  Longitudinal data are collected for patients on both the Transplant Essential Data and 
Comprehensive Report Form Track; the data differ in quantity and granularity. Data quality is 
ensured by computerized error checks and on- site audits.

1-9 The objective of the benchmark analysis was to select promising approaches to be further studied and to explore novel endpoints that could not only assess GVHD, but also the complex relationships between relapse and GVHD  as well as prolonged use of immune suppression. The 
control population selected from the CIBMTR database was comprised of patients who received 
HSCT  in a US center from 2006 to 2009 and who received tacrolimus and methotrexate as their 
sole GVHD prophylaxis. Data from single institution  studies of the three agents to be tested in this 
protocol  were also studied.  Populations differed according to disease, donor, conditioning 
intensity, disease risk and patient age. Six investigational approaches were evaluated: tacrolimus/MTX+etanercept, tacrolimus /MTX+pentostatin/ATG, PTCy , CD34 -selection, 
tacrolimus/MTX+bortezomib and tacrolimus/MTX+maraviroc  and compared to CIBMTR 
controls. Each investigational cohort differed in respect to size, disease status, graft source, 
conditioning regimen intensity and donor type. These differences between the investigational and 
control cohorts were adjusted using a Cox Regression models analyzing GVHD and survival 
outcomes ( Table 1 .4). CD34 -selection showed promising results in GVHD and survival outcomes, 
and PTCy  showed superiority in chronic GVHD outcomes compar ed to controls.

1-10 In addition to the standard variables of GVHD and survival, we studied a composite outcome that combined three important outcomes with median times of occurrence >90 days after HCT: chronic GVHD, relapse and all -cause mortality (CRFS). 
The proportion of patients not achieving this composite outcome within the CIBMTR controls was 20% by one year post -transplant ( Figure 
1.4). Thus, with current standard transplant approaches, only one fifth of patients are alive, disease-  and GVHD -free at one year postHCT. 
The BMT CTN Steering Committee felt that 
improvement on this dismal result should be the 
focus of the next generation of transplant trials 
and a goal for improvement in the field.  
 
1.5. Rationale  
 
This multicenter Phase III  clinical trial will evaluate two CNI -free approaches  for their efficacy in  
improving  the proportion of patients who do not develop moderate to  severe  chronic  GVHD, 
disease progression or relapse  or death compared to recipients of CNI -based GVHD prophylaxis.  
The results of this study will inform whether these CNI -free approaches offer advantage over CNI 
based according to this novel CRFS without the need for chronic immunosuppression.

2-1 CHAPTER 2  
  
2. STUDY DESIGN 
 2.1. Study Overview  
 
This is a Phase I II randomized, open label, multicenter trial comparing two CNI -free strategies: 
CD34 selection in PBSC grafts and infusion of BM grafts followed by high dose cyclophosphamide ( PTCy ) to unmanipulated BM transplants with standar d CNI ( tacrolimus ) and 
methotrexate (T ac/MTX) GVHD prophylaxis i n patients with hemato logic malignancies 
undergoing myeloablative conditioning hematopoietic cell transplantation.  The primary endpoint 
of chronic GVHD/relapse -free survival  (CRFS)  as a time to event endpoint  will be compared  
between the two CNI-free strategies  as well as between each CNI -free strategy and the CNI-based 
controls .  
 
2.2. Hypothesis and Specific  Objectives  
 
2.2.1. Hypothesis  
 CNI-free approaches result in lower rates of chronic GVHD and relapse and improved survival 
compared to standard CNI -based GVHD prophylaxis.    
 2.2.2. Study  Objective s  
 The primary objective of the randomized trial is to compare  CRFS after hematopoietic stem cell 
transplant
 (HSCT ) across the three arms of this trial. Secondary o bjectives are to  compare rates of 
grade II -IV and III -IV acute GVHD and chronic GVHD;  chronic GVHD- free survival ; 
immun osuppression -free survival ; neutrophil and platelet engraftment ; disease relapse;  transplant -
related mortality ; rates  of Grade ≥ 3 toxicity according to the Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 4.0; specifically rates of hepatic sinusoidal obstructive 
syndrome (SOS) and idiopathic pneumonia syndrome (IPS), incidence of infections;  specifically 
infections by CMV and EBV, quality of life  and overall survival  across the three arms of this trial.  
 
2.3. Patient Eligibility  
 
2.3.1. Inclusion Criteria  
1. Males and females a ged ≥ 1.0 year and  < 66.0 years  
2. Patients with acute leukemia  in morphologic complete remission with  or without  
hematologic recovery  or with myelodysplasia (MDS) with no circulating blasts and with 
less than  5% blasts in the bone marrow . Patients with CMML must have a WBC count ≤  
10,000 cells/µL and <  5% blasts in the marrow.  Patients with ≥  5% blasts due to a 
regenerating marrow must contact the protocol chairs for review.  
3. Planned myeloablative  conditioning  regimen  (see eligible regimens in Table 2.4)  
 CNI-Free GVHD Prophylaxis Protocol – 1301

2-2 4. Patients must have a related or unrelated  donor  as follows:  
a. Related donor must be an 8/8 match for HLA -A, -B, and - C at intermediate (or 
higher) resolution, and - DRB1 at high resolution using DNA -based typing . 
Pediatric related donors must weigh ≥ 25.0 kg., must have adequate peripheral 
venous catheter access for leukapheresis or must agree to placement of a central catheter, must be willing to (1) donate bone marrow and (2) receive G -CSF 
followed by donation of peripheral blood stem cells  (product to be determined by 
randomization post enrollment) and must meet institutional criteria for donation
1.  
b. Unrelated donor must be an 8/8 match at HLA -A, -B, -C and –DRB1 at high 
resolution using DNA -based typing . Unrelated donor must  be medically eli gible to 
donate according to NMDP (or equivalent donor search organization) criteria. At time of enrollment, the donor should not have any known preferences or contraindications to donate bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cells
1. 
i. Selection of unrelated donors is to be performed according to institutional 
practice. It is recommended that the time from collection to initiation of the 
cell processing be considered when prioritizing donors, as data shows better results for CD34 selection when cell processing  begins within 36 hours of 
the end of collection as indicated in section 2.5.1.2. 
5. Cardiac function: Ejection fraction  at rest  ≥ 45.0%  or shortening fraction of ≥ 27.0% by 
echocardiogram or radionuclide scan (MUGA ). 
6. Estimated cre atinine clearance (for patients > 12 years)  greater than 5 0.0 mL/minute  
(using the Cockcroft -Gault formula and actual body weight ); for pediatric patients  (≥ 1 
year to 12 years) , GFR estimated  by the updated Schwartz formula  ≥ 90.0 mL/min/1.73 
m
2. If the estimated  creatinine clearance is < 90 mL /min/1.73 m2, then renal function 
must be measured by 24- hour creatinine clearance or nuclear GFR , and must be  > 70 .0 
mL/min/1.73 m2. 
7. Pulmonary function: DLCO ≥  50% ( adjusted for hemoglobin) , and FVC and FEV1  ≥ 
50%; for children who are unable to perform for PFTs due to age or developmental 
ability, there must be no evidence of dyspnea and no need for supplemental oxygen, as 
evidenced by  O2 saturation ≥  92% on room air . 
8. Liver function: total bilirubin < 2x the upper limit of normal  (unless elevated bilirubin is 
attributed to Gilbert’s Syndrome)  and ALT/AST  < 2.5x the upper limit of normal.  
9. Signed informed consent .  
 
2.3.2. Exclusion Criteria  
1. Prior autologous or allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant  
                                                 
1 For unrelated donors, during the period of confirmatory typing, some donors may have preferences or 
contraindications to donate a certain stem cell graft source. Similar information would apply to related donors during 
the donor work up procedures. If a patient has only one potential donor and the donor has restrictions on which product 
he/she will donate, then the patient would not be eligible for this study.

2-4 2.4.  Conditioning Regimens  
 Minor modifications to the myeloablative regimens that involve star t day or days of rest in the 
Control Arm  are allowed but must be approved by the protocol chairs. Only minor modifications 
will be considered for approval. Modifications to the myeloablative regimens in the intervention 
arms ( CD34 Cell Selection Arm and Po st-Transplant Cy Arm)  are not allowed.  An additional 
day of rest may be added to conditioning regim ens of any arm when transportation and/or  
delivery of the patient’s  graft is  delayed.  
 
For patients who weigh less than 125% of their ideal body weight (IBW), dosing should be based 
on actual body weight . These dosing rules apply to all chemotherapy drugs listed in section 2.4. 
including cyclophosphamide, thiotepa, rATG, busulfan, fludarabine, melphalan and etoposide . 
Ideal and actual body weight units are in k g. 
 
Patients ≥  18.0 Years  of Age  
Males IBW = 50 k g + 2.3 kg/inch over 5 feet  (60 in)  
Females IBW = 45.5 kg + 2.3 kg/inch over 5 feet  (60 in)  
For patients less than 5 feet, subtract 2.3 kg/inch  
 
Metric Conversion  
Males IBW = 50 kg + 2.3 kg ([height in meters - 1.52] /0.025)  
Females IBW = 45.5 kg + 2.3 kg ([height in meters - 1.52] /0.025)  
For patients shorter than 1.52 m, subtract 2.3 kg/ for each 2.5 cm below 1.52m  
  
Patients ≥ 1.0 Year  and <  18.0 Years of Age  
 
Height Less than 60 inches  (5 feet or 1.52m)  
IBW = (ht2 x 1.65)/1000 where ht = cm, IBW = kg 
 
Height More than 60 inches  (5 feet or 1.52m)  
Males IBW = 39.0 + [2.27 x (ht -  60)] where ht = inches, IBW = kg 
Females IBW = 42.2 + [2.27 x (ht -  60)] where ht = inches, IBW = kg 
 Metric Conversion   
Males IBW = 39.0 + [2.27 x (height in meters  – 1.52/0.025)]  
Females IBW = 42.2 + [2.27 x ( height in meters – 1.52/0.025)]  
 For patients  who weigh greater  than or equal to 125% of their IBW, dosing should be based on the 
adjusted ideal body weight (AIBW).  
Adjusted Ideal Body Weight (AIBW) Formula:  
     AIBW = IBW + [(0.25) x (actual body weight – IBW)]

Days - 3 to - 2 Cyclophosphamide 60 mg/kg/day : IV for two consecutive days  
 Hyperfractionated TBI is administered at a dose rate of < 20 cGy/minute.  Doses of 125 
cGy/fraction are administered at a minimum interval of 4 hours between fractions, three times/day for a total of 11 doses (1375 cGy) over 4 days (Day - 9, -8, -7 and - 6). Sequential doses are 
administered in an anterior/posterior or lateral orientation. The orientation of TBI chosen will be 
left to the discretion of the radiation oncology specialist at each center but should remain consistent at each institution throughout the duration of the trial.  Full value lung blocks are not allowed. 
Compensators and lung blocks yielding a minimum of 800 cGy lung dose are allowed based on institutional practice.  Depending on the method of lung shielding employed and institutional 
practi ce, the blocked areas should be boosted with high- energy electrons or be otherwise radiated 
so that the cumulative chest wall dose is approximately 1300 cGy, so as to insure that marrow sites in the ribs are adequately treated. Palifermin may be given to p atients receiving TBI per 
institutional practices.   
 In addition, male patients receiving transplants for ALL or AML , use of boost to testes is allowed 
according to institutional practices.  
 If general anesthesia is required for TBI administration (e.g. , young children), a dose of 200cGy 
q12h x 7 doses to a total dose of 1400 cGy may be given. Alternatively, a dose of 165 cGy q12h x 
8 doses to a total dose of 1320 cGy may be given  to patients < 18 years according to institutional 
guidelines .  
 Thiotepa  will be administered at a dose of 5mg/kg/day IV for two consecutive days (Day -5 and 
-4). 
 
Rabbit anti -thymocyte globulin (Thymoglobulin
®) will be given as a single intravenous dose 
on Day -4 and Day -3 using rabbit antithymocyte globulin (Genzyme) at a d ose of 2.5 mg/kg /day. 
If the patient has a history of allergy or intolerance to rabbit ATG, equine antithymocyte globulin at a dose of 30 mg/kg may be used. The dose of ATG will be administered over 6- 8 hours.  
Methylprednisolone 1 mg/kg will be given as pr emedication  x 2 days with the ATG administration

administered as indicated according to institutional guidelines . If severe reaction is encountered 
after the first dose of ATG, the second dose can be delayed until D ay +5.   
 
Cyclophosphamide  will be administered at a dose of 60 mg/kg/day IV for two consecutive days 
(Day -3 and - 2). The Day –2 dose should be given in the morning, preferably before 10AM. Use 
of Me sna and dosing will be done according to institutional standards. A recommended approach 
is as follows: Mesna dose of ≥  80% of the total daily dose of Cy  and given in divided doses 30 
minutes before and at  3, 6, and 8- 9 hours after completion of Cy intravenously.

Participating centers will have the option of using oral or intravenous Busulfan (Bu). Oral Bu  will 
be administered at 4 mg/kg/day on Days - 7, -6, -5 and - 4 (1mg/kg every 6 hours). If the center is 
administering busulfan orally, pharmacokinetics analysis and targeting the dose to  
900+ 100 ng/mL must be performed or first AUC of 800 -1400 Bu Css 900 ± 100 ng/mL/or AUC 
of 800- 1400  μMol -min. 
 Intravenous Bu  is administered at a dose of 3.2 mg/kg/day or 130 mg/m
2/day on Days - 7, -6, -5 
and -4 either in four divided doses (0.8 mg/kg) or once daily (3.2 mg/kg or 130 mg/m2). Patients 
randomized to the PTCy arm, it is recommended that Bu dosing be divided in a Q6h schedule for 
four days. Busulfan pharmacokinetics studies are strongly encouraged with Bu Css 900 ± 100 
ng/mL/ or first AUC of 800 -1400 μMol -min, but are not mandated by this protocol. 
 
Cyclophosphamide (Cy)  will be administered on Day -3 and Day - 2 at a dose of 50 mg/kg per 
day intravenously (IV) if the patient is randomized to the PTCy arm, or at a dose of 60 mg/kg per 
day IV if the patient is randomized to the Control arm. Doses ≥ 5,000 mg must be infused IV over

2.5. Hematopoietic Stem Cell Graft Collection  
 
2.5.1. CD34 Selection  Arm  
 Donors of patients randomized to the CD34 selection arm are considered research subjects 
according to the FDA regulations  regarding human subjects (21 CFR Part 812.3) . Unrelated d onors 
will be consented after recipients are randomized. For unrelated donors, the National Marrow Donor Program (NMDP) will oversee the donor consent procedures by distributing the donor consent document to Donor Centers and maintaining IRB oversight of the consent procedures. For related donors, the consent process will be done at the transplant center along with r outine donor 
consent proce dures according to institutional guidelines. The donor informed consent document 
for related donors, including assent for minors, will be reviewed by each transplant center ’s IRB.  
 2.5.1.1. Mobilization of Donor  
 Following screening and enrollment, the donor of patients randomized to the CD34- selection arm 
will receive mobilization therapy with once daily G -CSF.  Mobilization will begin on Day -5 of the 
conditioning regimen at a G -CSF dose of 10 µg/kg/day actual body weight subcutaneously 
(rounded off to a multiple of the nearest vial size of either 300 or 480 µg).  Based on the volume, 
the dose may be split into 2 or 3 injection sites. The mobilization phase starts on the first day of 
administration of G -CSF and continues until the final day of leukapheresis.  
  2.5.1.2. Progenitor C ell C ollection and P rocessing  
 
Leukapheresis  
Leukapheresis will be performed on a continuous flow cell separator according to institutional standards and will commence on the morning of the fifth day of G -CSF treatment.  The anti-
coagulant used for the procedure will be acid citrate dextrose (ACD). No additional anti -coagulants 
or additives (heparin, etc.) should be added beyond those normally used during leukapheresis. The 
volume of blood processed per leukapheresis session s hould be approximately three to four times 
total blood volume as tolerated by the donor. Concurrent plasma (200- 300 mL) should be collected 
for products to be stored overnight after receipt into the processing facility. A unique identification 
and labeling  system shall be used to track the leukapheresis product from collection to infusion 
according to FACT /JACIE  guidelines.  
 
 CNI-Free GVHD Prophylaxis Protocol – 1301  
Version 4.0 dated June 22, 2017  
 
 
2-12 For the purpose  of cell infusion, the actual body weight will be used to calculate cell dose. A target 
dose ≥ 5.0 x 106 CD34+ cells/k g after selection containing ≤ 1.0 x 105  CD3+ cells/kg is desired.  
Up to two leukapheresis  products containing a total of 10.0 x 106 CD34+ cells per kg may be 
needed  to achieve this dose,  assuming a 50% recovery of CD34+ cells after processing.  A 
minimum of  4.0 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg must be collected to achieve an expected infusion dose of 
2.0 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg.   
 For related donors  - Decisions concerning the need for further product c ollection will be based 
on the known or projected enriched CD34+ cell content of the  previously collected products. Data 
from the BMT CTN 0303 trial  indicates a median recovery of CD34+ cells of 65% with more than 
90% of selection procedures having a recov ery ≥  50%.
66 As a conservative estimate ≥10 .0 x 106 
CD34+ cells/kg recipient body weight at collection should result in the desired target infusion dose of 5.0 x 10
6 CD34+ cells/kg.  The majority of patients will achieve this dose in a single apheresis 
colle ction and nearly all will achieve this dose with two collections. T-cell depletion was excellent 
in the BMT CTN 0303 study and it is not expected that T -cell content will exceed 1.0 x 105/kg 
with two collections.  If after two collections the CD34+ cell dose is ≥ 2.0 x 106 per kg ( the 
minimum required dose  for infusion) , no more collections will be performed. If the CD34+ cell 
dose is less than 4.0 X 106 cells/kg per kg  CD34+ selection will not be performed. 
  A third collection to be infused without CD34- enrichment may be considered only if <  2.0 x 10
6 
CD34+ cells/kg are expected to be available for infusion after two collections. If subsequent 
apheresis collection is not possible, or if minimum CD34 dose cannot be achieved without exceeding the maximum C D3 content, the patient will receive sufficient cells from the CD34 -
reduced fraction to reach the minimum CD34 dose.  If some or all of a third unmanipulated collection is infused or if cells from the CD34- reduced 
fraction are infused , the patient will be treated as if on the Control arm, receiving Tac/Mtx, but 
will be analyzed on the CD34+ selection arm, in accordance with the intent to treat principle.  
 
For unrelated donors -  The work up request to the donor  center will include the  CD34+ cell dose  
require d of 10.0 x 106 CD34+ cells per kg , which falls within routine specifications from NMDP. 
The peripheral stem cell collection procedures will be according to NMDP procedures.   
  Transport and storage of product prior to processing  
Analysis of processing data has indicated better results when processing is started within 36 hours of the end of collection. Therefore transport or storage times before the beginning of processing 
should target this upper limit.  Products that will start processing within 24 hours of collection 
should be transported or stored at room temperature (19- 25
oC). Products that require ≥24 hours of 
transport or storage should be maintained from the time of collection at refrigerator temperatures 
(1-8oC) but must be warmed to room temperature prior to the start of processing.  
 
CD34+ selection with CliniMACS device 
Cell processing personnel will receive training by Miltenyi on the CliniMACS System prior to 
activation of this protocol at their clinical site.  The site will provide docume ntation to Miltenyi on 
 CNI-Free GVHD Prophylaxis Protocol – 1301  
Version 4.0 dated June 22, 2017  
 
 
2-13 competency in the processing procedures , including the results of validation runs on the 
CliniMACS System . 
 
CD34+ cell selection will be performed according to procedures given in the CliniMACS Users 
Manual  for the CliniMACS® CD34 Reagent System  and the BMT CTN 1301 Standard Operating 
Procedures (SOPs)  for CD34 Selection, in place and validated at the study sites. The CliniMACS 
Users Manual can be found on the manufactures website 
(http://www.miltenyibiotec.com/en/clinical -applications/clinimacs -cd34- reagent -system -fda-
approved/health- care- professionals/downloads -and-references.aspx ). 
 
Analysis of allograft  
Samples will be taken from each leukapheresis product after collection and before processing and 
on each fraction of cell s after processing on a single CliniMACS tubing set. Pre- and post -CD34+ 
select ed cells shall be  characterized as follows:  
• Graft Evaluation ( tests are performed as part of graft processing ) 
- Gram stain (done locally) post -selection  
- Total nucleated cell count (done locally) pre - and post -processing   
- Endotoxin testing post -processing , done locally or sent to an authorized lab  
- Flow cytometric analysis for CD34+ cells and for CD3+ cells pre-  and post -processing 
done locally using validated SOPs  
- Flow cytometric analysis of monocytes, B cells, NK cells in the CD34 -enriched 
products  
- Viability testing (7 -AAD method or other fluorescent vital dye ) pre- and post-
processing  
- 14 day sterility cultures post -processing done locally using validated SOPs. 
• Criteria  for release of graft product  for infusion. Not e more than one CD34- enriched 
fraction may constitute a single graft product . 
- Viability ≥  70% after selection  
- Negative gram stain  
- Cumulative CD34+ cell content ≥ 2.0 x 106 per kg   
- Cumulative CD3+ cell content ≤ 1.0 x 105 per kg 
 As noted above, the target optimal allograft cell doses following processing on the CliniMACS
 
device include both a CD34+ cell count of > 5.0 x 106/kg recipient weight and a CD3+ cell dose of 
< 1.0 x 105/kg actual recipient weight.  The targeted minimum CD34+ cell dose following CD34+ 
selection is 2.0 x 106/kg while the absolute minimum CD34+ cell dose is ≥1.0 x 106/kg.  
 
It is also possible that doses of CD34+ cells far exceeding 5 x 106/kg can be given without 
exceeding the maximum T -cell dose of 1.0  x 105 CD3+ cells/kg.  High doses of CD34+ cells in 
 CNI-Free GVHD Prophylaxis Protocol – 1301  
Version 4.0 dated June 22, 2017  
 
 
2-14 extensively T-cell depleted transplants are postulated to hasten immune reconstitution, without 
altering the low risk of GVHD. Consequently, there is no upper limit for the dose of CD34+ cells/kg 
as long as the dose of CD3+ cells does not exceed 1 .0 x 105/kg.  
 
Cryopreservation: If it is determined after randomization that cryopreservation may be needed, it 
must be approved by the protocol chairs.  
 
2.5.1.3. Bone M arrow C ollection  and P rocessing  
 
Bone marrow grafts will be used in patients who  are randomized to either the PTCy  or the C ontrol 
arms. Bone marrow donors should undergo harvest in a time frame that will allow fastest delivery 
on Day 0. Either general or regional (epidural, spinal) anesthesia may be used . Donor bone marrow 
will be harvested with a target yield of 4 x 108 nucleated cells/kg recipient actual  body weight. The 
CD 34+ and T -cell count in the marrow will be quantified by flow cytometry according to 
institutional guidelines.  Prior to the initiation of the transplant conditioning regimen, the estimated 
cell dose and a planned donor marrow volume shall be agreed upon by the donor and transplant 
center for unrelated donors ; and between the transplant physician and cell processing laboratory 
for related donors .  
 Bone marrow processing, other than anticoagulation, filtration, packaging, and labeling in preparation for transportation, should not be performed by the collection center. 
The bone marrow 
graft will not be manipulated to deplete T  cells.  Patients will receive unprocessed marrow unless there 
is a major ABO incompatibility, in which case red blood cells will be depleted from the donor marrow 
using institutional practices. Institutional practices will determine if there will be proces sing for minor 
ABO incompatibilities. Processing for reduction of volume, plasma or fat may be performed by the 
transplant center according to institutional guidelines.  
 
Cryopreservation: If it is determined after randomization that cryopreservation may be  needed, it 
must be approved by the protocol chairs.  
2.6. GVHD Prophylaxis  
 For patients who weigh less than 125% of their ideal body weight (IBW), dosing should be based on actual body weight. For patients who weigh greater than or equal to 125% of their IBW, dosing should be based on the adjusted ideal body weight (AIBW). These dosing rules do not apply to 
cyclosporine or tacrolimus, which should be dosed based on actual body weight.  
 
2.6.1. Post-Transplant  Cyclophosphamide  
 
Hydration prior to cyclophosphamide may be  given according to institutional standards. A 
recommended approach is as follows:  Patients are instructed to increase fluids overnight before 
cyclophosphamide administration. Hydration with normal saline at 3 ml/kg/hr IV will be started 2 
hours prior to c yclophosphamide , then the rate will be reduced to 2 ml/kg/hr for 1 hour pre -
cyclophosphamide and continued at 2 ml/kg/hr for 8 hours post -cyclophosphamide. 
 
 CNI-Free GVHD Prophylaxis Protocol – 1301  
Version 4.0 dated June 22, 2017  
 
 
2-15 Mesna is required in patients  on the post -transplant Cy arm . Mesna dose must  be ≥ 80% of the 
total daily dose of Cy and  given in divided doses 30 minutes  before  and at 3, 6, and 8- 9 hours after 
completion of  Cy intravenously .  
 Cyclophosphamide [50 mg/kg] will be given on Day 3 post -transplant ( between 60 and 72 hours 
after marrow infusion ) and on Day 4 post-transplant (approximately 24 hours after Day 3 
cyclophosphamide). Cyclophosphamide will be given as an IV infusion over 1- 2 hours (depending 
on volume).   
Systemic c orticosteroids may not be used as an anti -emetic agent and should not be 
administered  until 24 hours after the completion of post -transplantation cyclophosphamide, 
unless clinically indicated.   
 
If patient develops GVHD on one of the CNI -free arms (PTCy or CD34 selection), the following 
treatment approach is recommended:  
 
a. Skin disease only (< 50%BSA) – the recommended treatment is topical steroids . 
 
b. Skin disease only  (>50%BSA) – the recommended treatment is topical steroids 
with low threshold to escalate to systemic steroids. For systemic steroids, 
prednisone (1 to 2 mg/kg/day or IV equivalent) can be used. If no response after 72 hours or need for prolonged systemic steroids, the recommendation is to add tacrolimus (level 5 -10 ng/mL).  
 
c. Grade 2 GI (upper or lower)  - the recommended treatment is a trial of 
budesonide (9 mg total daily). I f no response within 7 days or progression within 
72h, prednisone (2 mg/kg/day or IV equivalent) can be used, in addition to beclomethasone and/or budesonide for GI GVHD, and tacrolimus (level 5 -10 
ng/ml).   
d. Grade 3 -4 GI (upper or lower) or hepatic GVHD:  the recommended treatment 
is prednisone (2 mg/kg/day or IV equivalent), in addition to beclomethasone and/or budesonide for GI GVHD, and tacrolimus (level 5- 10 ng/ml).  
 2.6.2. CNI/Methotrexate  Control Arm  
 
2.6.2.1. Tacrolimus  
 
Tacrolimus  will be given orally or intravenously per institutional standards  starting Day –3. The 
dose of tacrolimus may be rounded to the nearest 0.5 mg for oral formulations. Subsequent dosing will be based on blood levels, with a target of 5- 15 ng/ml. If patients  are on medications which 
alter the metabolism of tacrolimus (e.g. azoles), the initial starting dose and subsequent doses should be altered as per institutional practice s. Tacrolimus taper can be initiated at a minimum of 
90 days post HSCT if there is no evidence of active GVHD. The rate of tapering will be done 
according institutional practices but patients should be off tacrolimus by Day 180 post HSCT if there is no evidence of active GVHD.  
 CNI-Free GVHD Prophylaxis Protocol – 1301  
Version 4.0 dated June 22, 2017  
 
 
2-16  Cyclosporine may be substituted for tacrolimus  if the patient is intolerant of tacrolimus or per 
institutional practice. Cyclosporine will be administered IV beginning on Day -3 and doses will be 
adjusted to maintain a trough level of 200- 400 ng/mL by HPLC or 250- 500 ng/mL by TDX method 
(or 100- 250 ng/mL by Tandem MS  or equivalent level for other CSA testing methods) or within 
therapeutic level per institutional standard testing. If patients are on medications which alter the 
metabolism of cyclosporine (e.g. azoles), the initial starting dose and subsequent doses should be altered as per institutional practice s. Cyclosporine taper can be initiated at a minimum of 90 days 
post HSCT if there is no evidence of active GVHD. The rate of tapering will be done according institutional practices but patients should be off cyclosporine by Day 180 post HSCT if there is no evidence of active GVHD.  
 
2.6.2.2.  Methotrexate 
 
Methotrexate will be administered at the doses of  15 mg/m
2 IV bolus on Day  +1, and 10 mg/m2 
IV bolus on Day s +3, +6 and +11 after  hematopoietic  stem cell infusion.  The Day +1 dose of 
methotrexate should be given at least 24 hours af ter the  hematopoietic  stem cell infusion  ends. 
Dose reduction of MTX due to worsening creatinine clearance after initiation of conditioning 
regimen, high serum levels or development of oral mucos itis is allowed according to institutional 
practices.  Leucovorin rescue is allowed according to institutional practices.  
 
2.7. Transplant Procedures  
 
Unmanipulated BM or mobilized CD34- selected PBSC  grafts  will be administered on Day 0 to all 
patients according to individual institutional guidelines after appropriate processing and quantification has been performed by the local laboratory. Stem cells are administered through an indwelling central venous cat heter.  If infusion occurs over two days, Day 0 is the first day the 
infusion is initiated . 
 
2.8. Supportive Care  
 
All supportive care will be given in keeping with the BMT CTN Manual of Procedures and local 
institutional practice.  Supportive care should be admi nistered in a similar fashion to subjects 
randomized to all three  arms of the study.  
 
2.8.1. Growth Factors  
 
G-CSF may be given per institutional guidelines .  
 
2.8.2. Seizure Prophylaxis  
 
Keppra (Levetiracetam)  will be administered  for the prevention of busulfan -associated seizures  to 
all research participants receiving busulfan, starting Day –10 or 12 hours prior to starting busulf an. 
Dosing of Levetiracetam will be administered as per the BMT guidelines. Alternatively, Phenytoin  
or another similar seizure prophylaxis agents may be administered starting day –10 or 12 hours 
 CNI-Free GVHD Prophylaxis Protocol – 1301  
Version 4.0 dated June 22, 2017  
 
 
2-17 prior to starting busulf an for the prevention of busulfan- associated seizures , according to 
institutional practices .  
 2.8.3. Blood Products  
 Transfusion thresholds for blood product support will be consistent with the BMT CTN MOP and standard institutional guidelines.  All bloo d products will be irradiated.  
 2.8.4. Prophylaxis Against Infections  
 Patients will receive infection prophylaxis according to institutional guidelines. Infection 
prophylaxis should include, but is not limited to, agents or strategies (e.g., PCR screening and 
preemptive therapy) to reduce the risk of bacterial, herpes simplex, CMV, EBV, Pneumocystis 
jiroveci, toxoplasmosis, and fungal infections:  
• Antifunga l therapy: Prophylaxis with fluconazole or other antifungal agents  can be given 
as per local institutional guidelines.  Flucon azole, voriconazole and other azoles are 
expected to increase serum cyclosporine or tacrolimus levels, therefore, dosages of 
cyclosporine or tacrolimus should be adjusted accordingly.   
• Cytomegalovirus (CMV ): For patients on the CD34- selection arm, CMV monitoring 
through nucleic acid amplified testing (NAAT) will be done weekly through Day 100 and then at each clinical assessment  until Day 180 post -transplant. For patients on the other 2 
arms, CMV monitoring  will be done according to institutional guidelines. It is 
recommended  that weekly assessment for CMV be done through Day 63 post-transplant, 
and then at each clinical assessment until day 180 post -transplant. Any reactivation and/or 
CMV disease will be captured in this study.  Preemptive treatment (early treatment of CMV 
viremia detected by PCR) is the preferred strategy for the majority of patients.  It is 
recommended that t he threshold to initiate preemptive therapy will be according to a value 
determined by the assay being performed at the institution or a rising trend on successive measurements from patient’s baseline. As an example, when using an FDA -approved assay 
that has been calibrated, using WHO CMV standards , a threshold of 500 international units 
(IU)/mL may be used.  
• Epstein -Barr Virus (EBV): For patients on the CD34- selection arm, EBV monitoring 
through nucleic acid amplified testing (NAAT) will be done weekly through Day 100 and 
then at each clinical assessment until Day 180 post -transplant. For patients on the other 2 
arms, EBV monitoring will be done according to institutional guidelines.  See below for 
management of patients with EBV viremia or lymphoprolifer ative syndrome (section 
2.9.7.).   
• Pneumocystis jiroveci: Prophylaxis with agents  against Pneumocystis jiroveci can be given 
as per local institutional guidelines.  In recipients of CD34- selected grafts, it is 
recommended that prophylaxis continue beyond day 180, until immune recovery, defined by a normal CD4 T cell count. 
 CNI-Free GVHD Prophylaxis Protocol – 1301  
Version 4.0 dated June 22, 2017  
 
 
2-18 • Herpes virus (HSV or VZV): Patients must receive acyclovir or valacyclovir through Day 
365 post-transplant as standard prophylaxis  against HSV and VZV per institutional 
guidelines  or until the CD4 T -cell count has normalized .  
• Toxoplasmosis: For patients on the CD34- selection arm  that are at risk (seropositive patient 
or donor) , it is required  that toxoplasmosis prophylaxis , through site preferred methods, 
begin on Day 30 post -transplant . Prophylaxis with agents  against toxoplasmosis can be 
given as per local institutional guidelines.  In recipients of CD34- selected grafts, 
prophylaxis should be given to patients  at risk and continue d beyond day 180, until immune 
recovery, defined by a normal CD4 T cell count . 
 
2.8.5. Intravenous Immune Globulin (IVIG)  
 IVIG administration will be according to local institutional standard practice.  
 2.8.6. Sinusoidal Obstruction Syndrome (SOS)/Veno -occlusive Disease (VOD) of the Liver  
Prophylaxis  
 Prophylaxis against SOS /VOD with heparin and/or ursodiol will be according to local institutional 
standard practice.  
 2.8.7. Donor Lymphocyte Infusions  – Viral -specific C ytotoxic T -Lymphocytes (CTLs)  
 
Donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI) should only be performed for therapeutic reasons, including but not limited to relapsed or persistent disease or refractory infections. DLI should not be 
administered for mixed chimerism only.  
 Viral specific CTL (d onor-derived or third- party) may be given for treatment of infections not 
responding to standard therapy  (e.g. CMV, EBV, adenovirus, etc) . For any investigational agent, 
the investigator will submit the research protocol to the BMT CTN 1301 protocol coordi nator for 
review and approval by the protocol chairs/officer  in order to co- enroll the patient on the non-
BMT CTN study.  
 
2.9. Participant Risks  
 
2.9.1. Potential Sensitization to Murine Proteins  
 
Mouse protein antibodies are used in the CliniMACS
 processing procedures  in the CD34 –
selection arm . If the recipient has a pre- existing allergy, he or she may be at risk for allergic 
reactions during infusion of the processed cells, although the residual amount of murine protein in 
the final product is very low (estimated maximum dose for a 50 kg patient would be 30 µg). To 
date, no allergic reactions are reported in patients receiving cells processed with the CliniMACS 
System.  Epinephrine and antihistamines will be available at the recipient's bedside d uring the 
PBSC infusion.  
 
 CNI-Free GVHD Prophylaxis Protocol – 1301  
Version 4.0 dated June 22, 2017  
 
 
2-19 2.9.2. Graft  Infusion 
 Symptoms may include changes in heart rate and/or rhythm, changes in blood pressure, fever, chills, sweats, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal cramping, hemoglobinuria, acute renal failure, allergic reactions, r espiratory dysfunction, or headache.  
 2.9.3. Infections  
 Transplantation puts the patient at higher risk for bacterial, viral, or fungal infections, which are potentially  life-threatening.  These risks  are potentially higher with CD -34 selected  transplants.  
Proph ylaxis will be initiated  and patients will be closely monitored for signs of infections and will 
receive early and appropriate treatment . 
 
2.9.4. Graft -Versus -Host Disease  
 
Acute or chronic GVHD may develop after allogeneic transplantation that can be disabling a nd 
can lead to death.  GVHD is thought to be initia ted by T -cells contained in the  graft.  CD34
+ 
selection and PTCy  reduce the number of alloreactive T-cells but GVHD can occur after these  
transplants.  2.9.5. Sinusoidal Obstruction Syndrome (SOS)/ Veno -occlusive Di sease (VOD) of the Liver  
 SOS/ VOD is a manifestation of damage to the liver by the conditioning regimen that usually 
develops within two weeks after allogeneic transplant and is characterized by at least two of the following:  
• Hyperbilirubinemia (total bilirubin > 2 mg/dL)  
• Hepatomegaly or right upper quadrant pain, or  
• Sudden weight gain (> 5% above baseline)  
Recipients developing SOS/ VOD will be monitored closely and will receive appropriate 
supportive care and careful fluid management. TCD is not expected to affect the risk of SOS/ VOD.  
 
2.9.6. End Organ Damage  
 
End organ damage of all or any of the major organs, including the brain, may occur as a result of cumulative toxicity from anti- neoplastic therapy, reactions to other drugs, and as a result of 
destructive processes (e.g., infection, GVHD, etc.) and may have a fatal outcome. Toxicities may 
occur in any individual patient due to multiple events and cumulative effects that may involve any and all organs, including the brain. Brain damage can result in severe loss of cognitive or 
neurologic function. Data from previous studies do not suggest that the risk of end organ damage 
is appreciably affected by TCD or the preparative regimens t o be used in this study.  
 
2.9.7. Lymphoproliferative Syndrome  
 
 CNI-Free GVHD Prophylaxis Protocol – 1301  
Version 4.0 dated June 22, 2017  
 
 
2-20 Recipients of CD34- selected allogeneic grafts have an increased risk of developing post -transplant 
lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD)  caused by EBV.  Patients who develop a fever of unknown 
origin to > 39oC, lymphadenopathy, or hepatosplenomegaly, should undergo CT scanning of the 
chest and abdomen and/or PET scan to rule out or stage EBV PTLD.  Tissue diagnosis that includes 
EBER and LMP -1 immunocytochemistry should be attempted. Other diagnostic or staging studies 
will be performed as clinically indicated.  EBV PTLD may rapidly progress and can be fatal if not 
treated.  Management of suspected EBV PTLD should be discussed with one of the Protocol 
Chairpersons. EBV PTLD can be treated with rituximab and/or infusion of 106 T-cells/kg from the 
donor. It is recommended that patients w ith EBV DNA levels of > 1000 copies/mL receive 375 
mg/m2 of rituximab.  Those patients that continue to have levels above 1000 copies/mL on 
subsequent testing should be considered to receive three additional weekly infusions of 375 mg/m2 
of rituximab.  Patie nts w ith rapidly rising EBV DNA levels or clinical symptoms are recommended 
to have imaging studies to diagnose an EBV PTLD. An accelerated schedule of days 1, 4, 8, 15 
can be used if there is a suspicion of EBV PTLD.  Rituximab has been shown to induce regression 
in 50 -  70% of cases.  Note: Rituximab does not enter the CNS and is not effective in treating CNS 
disease.  Donor lymphocyte infusions may induce regression in > 90% of cases of EBV PTLD and 
are effective in CNS disease.  
 2.9.8. Death  
 There is an approxim ate 5-10% risk of transplant -related  mortality within the first month of 
transplant due to the risk of severe regimen related toxicity, hemorrhage, opportunistic infection, or other complications. It is not expected that the regimens to be used in this protocol will increase 
this risk.  
 2.9.9. Therapy Toxicities  
 All toxicities will be graded using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 4.0. Below is a list of the most common toxicities for therapies used in this 
study. See the FDA -approved package insert for each drug for a comprehensive list of adverse 
events.  
 2.9.10. Busulfan  
 Busulfan (1, 4- dimethanesulfonoxybutane) is an alkylating agent. The drug is extensively  
metabolized and its metabolites are eventually excreted in the urine. The o ral preparation is well  
absorbed but studies at this institution have indicated that there is a ten -fold variability area  under 
the curve (AUC) of the drug among patients receiving busulfan by mouth. There is a  statistical 
association between increased AUC  and the development of veno occlusive disease of  the liver. 
Since its FDA approval in 1999, IV Bu has been used increasingly in combination with CY or Flu.
17, 18, 19, 20 IV Bu was initially administered every 6 -hours, similar to oral Bu. However, several 
studies have used the drug with once or twice daily administration. In terms of safety, IV Bu and 
oral Bu appear to  have similar toxic ity profiles.  It has been proposed that sinusoidal obstruction 
syndrome and mucositis may be reduced in incidence and severity with IV Bu.21 The I V 
formulation at a dose of 0.8 mg/kg IV every 6- hrs is considered equivalent to the oral formulation 
 CNI-Free GVHD Prophylaxis Protocol – 1301  
Version 4.0 dated June 22, 2017  
 
 
2-21 at a dose of 1 mg/kg PO every 6 hrs in conditioning regimens. On this basis a regimen using 4x0.8 
= 3.2 mg/kg as a single daily dose has been developed.19, 22 
 Toxicities associated with busul fan administration include: 
• Gastrointestinal: nausea, vomiting, constipation, diarrhea, abdominal discomfort, anorexia, 
dyspepsia and mucositis  
• Hepatobiliary: veno- occlusive disease  
• Neurologic: headache, insomnia and seizures

• Miscellaneous: rhinorrhea, amenorrhea, infertility, skin rashes, cataracts  
 
2.9.11. Cyclophosphamide  
 
Cyclophosphamide (CY)  
is an alkylating agent which prevents cell division primarily by cross -linking 
DNA strands . CY is converted to its active form in vivo by hepatic enzymes.  After a single dose, 
tissue enzymes degrade most of the active metabolites.  After high doses (> 40 m g/kg), the 
alkylating activity in the plasma is minimal by 24 hours . Several of the metabolites appear to have 
toxic actions.  One of the metabolic products, acrolein (CH 2=CH -CHO), is known to be toxic to 
the bladder urothelium and can cause hemorrhagic cys titis when CY is administered at high doses.  
 
Some of the most common toxicities associated with cyclophosphamide include:  
• Gastrointestinal: nausea, vomiting and anorexia  
• Hematologic: myelosuppression 
• Cardiovascular: severe chronic heart failure character ized by cardiomegaly, pericardial 
effusions, diffuse voltage decrease on ECG and decreased LVEF  
• Genitourinary: hemorrhagic cystitis (prevented by hydration and mesna therapy or bladder irrigation) and gonadal function impairment  
• Miscellaneous: fluid retention, alopecia and rare pulmonary toxicity  
 2.9.12. Etoposide  
 The most common side effects of etoposide are:  
• Hematologic: myelosuppression 
• Gastrointestinal: nausea, vomiting, anorexia, diarrhea, abdominal pain, stomatitis  
• Dermatologic: alopecia  
• Cardiovascular: hypotension 
• Neurologic: peripheral neuropathy  
• Miscellaneous: elevated liver function tests, allergic reactions, and second cancers including myelodysplasia

• Hematologic: myelosuppression 
• Dermatologic: transient generalized skin erythema, mainly in the axillary and inguinal 
folds   
• Neurologic:  mild cognitive dysfunction, disorie ntation, confusion and irritability  
 
2.9.18. Tacrolimus  
 
Tacrolimus often called by its original drug code name, FK -506, is a macrolide immunosuppressant 
that inhibits calcineurin (phosphatase 2B)-mediated T -cell activation by forming a complex with 
FK506 binding protein 12 (FKBP12). Tacrolimus s ide effects include:  
• Cardiovascular: hypertension  
• Neurologic: confusion, dizziness, insomnia, seizures, tremors, changes in how clearly one

2-24 • Hematologic: thrombotic microangiopathy  
• Endocrine and metabolic: electrolyte imbalances  
• Miscellaneous: hirsutism; hepatic and renal dysfunction; nephrotoxicity ; gingival 
hyperplasia; transient blindness   
 
2.9.21. MESNA ( Sodium - 2-Mercaptoethane S ulphonate)   
 Mesna is a prophylactic agent used to prevent hemorrhagic cystitis induced by the oxazophosphorines (cyclophosphamide and ifosfamide). It has no intrinsic cytotoxicity and no 
antagonistic effects on chemotherapy. Mesna binds with acrolein, the urotoxic metabolite produced by the oxazophosphorines, to produce a non- toxic thioether and slows the rate of ac rolein 
formation by combining with 4 -hydroxy metabolites of oxazophosphorines. At the doses used for 
uroprotection, mesna is virtually non- toxic. The most common side effects of MESNA are:  
• Cardiovascular: hypotension 
• Dermatologic: rash, urticarial  
• Gastroin testinal : nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, altered taste  
• Neurologic:  headache, joint or limb pain  
• Miscellaneous: fatigue  
 
 
2.10. Quality of Life Assessments 
 
2.10.1. Instruments  
 
FACT -BMT : The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy – Bone Marrow Transplant 
subscale67 version 4.0 instrument is a 37 item scale comprised of a general core questionnaire, the 
FACT -G, that evaluates the health -related quality of life (HQL) of patients receiving treatment for 
cancer, and a specific module, BMT Concerns, t hat addresses disease and treatment -related 
questions specific to bone marrow transplant. The FACT -G consists of four subscales developed 
and normed in cancer patients:  Physical Well- being, Social/Family Well- being, Emotional Well -
being, and Functional Wel l-being. Each subscale is positively scored, with higher scores indicating 
better functioning. The FACT -BMT Trial Outcome Index, comprised of the physical well being 
scale, the functional well being scale and the BMT specific items, will be used as the out come 
measure in summarizing the FACT -BMT data.  The FACT -BMT takes 6 minutes to complete, and 
is routinely used in BMT CTN trials .  
 
MOS SF -36: The Medical Outcomes Study Short Form 36 is a 36 item general assessment of 
health quality of life with eight components: Physical Functioning, Role Physical, Pain Index, General Health Perceptions, Vitality, Social Functioning, Role Emotional, and Mental Health Index.  Each domain is positively scored, indicating that higher scores are associated with positive 
outcom e. This scale has been widely applied in a variety of outcome studies and is being used in 
this protocol as a generic measure of quality of life. To facilitate comparison of the results with 
published norms, the Physical Component Summary (PCS) and Mental Component Summary (MCS) will be used as the outcome measures in summarizing the SF -36 data. These summary 
scores are derived by multiplying the z -score for each scale by its respective physical or mental 
 CNI-Free GVHD Prophylaxis Protocol – 1301  
Version 4.0 dated June 22, 2017  
 
 
2-25 factor score coefficient and summing the products. Resulting scores are then transformed into T -
scores (mean=50; standard deviation=10). The SF -36 takes 6 minutes to complete.68, 69 
 
MDASI : The MD Anderson Symptom Inventory  is a 19 item instrument that captures 13 
symptoms ( 0=“not present” to 10=“as bad as yo u can imagine”) and 6 items measuring 
interference with life from 0 (“did not interfere”) to 10 (“interfered completely”). It provides two summary scales: symptoms and interference.
70 The MDASI takes less than 5 minutes to complete, 
and was  collected in the  BMT CTN 0802 trial of acute GVHD treatment .  
 
PedsQL: The PedsQL™ Stem Cell Transplant Module  is a 46  item instrument that measures  
health -related quality of life in children and adolescents undergoing hematopoietic stem cell 
transplant, and is developmentally appropriate for self -report in ages 8  through 18 years.  
 
2.10.2. Administration  
 
The self report questionnaires will be completed at  Baseline, then at Day 100, Day 180, 12 months  
and 24 months post-transplant  or until death. Only English  speaking adult and pediatric patients,  
and Spanish speaking adult patients are eligible to participate in the Health Quality of Life ( HQL ) 
component of this trial. Patients >18 years will complete the FACT -BMT, MOS SF -36 and 
MDASI instruments. Patients ≥  8 years through 18 years will complete the Peds QL™ Stem Cell 
Transplant Module . Surveys are completed by participants using self -completed instruments as a 
first choice.  If this method of data collection is not possible, then surveys and response options 
may be read  verbatim to participants, either in person or over the phone, to collect data. The method 
of survey completion, the date, and the language will be recorded in the database. Surveys may 
not be completed by surrogates .

3-1 CHAPTER 3  
 
 
3. STUDY ENDPOINTS  
 
3.1. Primary Endpoint  
 
The primary endpoint is chronic GVHD/relapse -free survival (CRFS).  All randomized patients 
will be analyzed for this endpoint  from the date of randomization. An event for this time to event 
outcome is defined as moderate to severe chronic GVHD according to NIH consensus criteria 
global score, disease relapse,  or death by any cause.  Patients will be followed up for two years for 
this endpoint.  
 
3.2. Secondary Endpoints  
 
3.2.1. Overall Survival  
 Overall survival is defined as the time interval between date of transplant and death from any cause or for surviving patients, to last follow -up. The event for this endpoint is death from any cause.  
 3.2.2. Disease Relapse  
 Relapse is defined by either morphological evidence of acute leukemia or MDS consistent with 
pre-transplant  features, documented or not by biopsy. The event is defined as increase in size of 
prior sites of disease or evidence of new sites of disease, documented or not by biopsy.  
 Acute leukemia and MDS  – Relapse will be diagnosed when there is  morphologic or clinical 
evidence of disease:  
- Reappearance of leukemia blast cells in the per ipheral blood; or,  
- >5% blasts in the bone marrow, not attributable to another cause (e.g. bone marrow regeneration) ; or 
- The appearance of previous or new dysplastic changes  (MDS specific)  within the bone 
marrow with or without falling donor chimerism; or  
- The development of extramedullary leukemia or leukemic cells in the cerebral spinal fluid ; 
or 
 Institution of any therapy to treat persistent or relapsed d isease, including donor lymphocyte 
infusion, will be considered evidence of relapse regardless of whether the criteria described above were met. Two exceptions are the administration of FLT3 and other  tyrosine kinase inhibitors for 
post-transplant maintenance and for preven tion of disease relapse in patient with or without 
minimal residual disease identified after transplant.    
 CNI-Free GVHD Prophylaxis Protocol – 1301  
Version 4.0 dated June 22, 2017  
 
 
3-2 3.2.3. Relapse- Free Survival  
 Relapse- free survival is the time from date of transplant to death or relapse, whichever comes first.  
The event for this endpoint is relapse  or death.  Patients alive and free from disease relapse  will be 
censored at last follow -up.  
 3.2.4. Transplant -related Mortality  
 The cumulative incidence of transplant -related mortality ( TRM ) will be estimated at Days 100, 
180, and 1 year after HSCT. An event for this endpoint is death without evidence of disease 
recurrence. Disease recurrence will be considered a competing event.  
 
3.2.5. Immunosuppression- free Survival  
 
Patients who are alive, relap se-free, and do not need ongoing immune suppression to control 
GVHD at one year post HSCT are considered successes for this endpoint. Immune suppression is 
defined as any systemic agents used to control or suppress GVHD . Corticosteroid doses of 
prednisone >10 mg , or equivalent  (0.15 mg/kg for pediatrics)  will be considered active systemic 
immune suppression treatment. Patients who discontinued immune suppression ≤  15 days prior to 
the 1 -year time point will be considered to be on immune suppression for this  endpoint. 
Additionally the burden of immunosuppression in one year defined as the number of agents, the 
line of therapy, dose and duration of therapy will be described for all patients.   
3.2.6. Hematologic Recovery  
 Hematologic recovery will be assessed accordi ng to neutrophil and platelet counts recovery after 
HSCT. Neutrophil recovery is defined as achieving an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 500/mm
3 for three consecutive measurements on three different days. The first of the three days 
will be designated th e day of neutrophil recovery. The competing event is death without neutrophil 
recovery.  For patients who never drop ANC below 500/mm3, the date of neutrophil recovery will 
be Day +1 post HSCT.  
 Platelet recovery is defined as  the first day of a sustained platelet count >20,000/mm
3 with no 
platelet transfusion in the preceding seven days. The first day of sustained platelet count above 
this threshold will be designated the day of platelet engraftment. For patients who never drop their 
platelet count below 20,000/mm3, the date of platelet recovery will be Day +1 post HSCT.

Version 4.0 dated June 22, 2017  
 
 
3-3   
3.2.7. Graft Failure  
 
Graft failure will be assessed as secondary endpoints, including primary and secondary graft failure.  Primary graft failure is defined as no neutrophil recovery to > 500 cells/µL by Day 28 post 
HSCT.  Secondary graft failure will be assessed according to neutrophil count  after initial 
hematologic recovery . Secondary graft failure is defined as initial neutrophil engraftment followed 
by subsequent decline in absolute neutrophil counts < 500 cells/µL, unresponsive to growth factor 
therapy , but cannot be explained by disease  relapse or  medications.  Assessment for this endpoint 
will occur up to two years post HSCT.  
  
 3.2.8. Acute GVHD  
 
Cumulative incidences of grade II -IV and I II-IV acute GVHD will be determined.  Acute GVHD 
will be graded according to the BMT CTN MOP.  The time of onset of acute grades II -IV and III -
IV acute GVHD will be recorded, as well as the maximum grade achieved.  This endpoint will be 
evaluated through 180 days post HSCT.  
 3.2.9. Chronic GVHD  
 The cumulative incidence of chronic GVHD will be determined. Data will be collected directly 
from providers and chart review according to the recommendations of the NIH Consensus Criteria. Eight organs will be scored on a 0- 3 scale to reflect degree of chronic GVHD involvement. Liver 
and pulmonary function test results and use of systemic therapy for treatment of chronic GVHD will also be recorded.  These data will allow calculation of the NIH global severity scores of mild, 
moderate and severe chronic GVHD.  Assessment of development of chronic GVHD will occur up 
to two years post HSCT.   3.2.10. Chronic GVHD- Free Survival  
 The event for this endpoint includes moderate to severe chronic GVHD according to NIH consensus criteria global s core, or death by any cause. Assessment for this endpoint will occur up 
to two years post HSCT.   
3.2.11. Toxicity  
 All grades ≥ 3 toxicities according to CTCAE, version 4 will be tabulated for each intervention arm. The proportion of patients developing grade ≥ 3 AE across intervention arms will be 
compared.  Additionally incidences of hepatic sinusoidal obstruction syndrome/ veno- occlusive 
disease ( SOS/VOD) or idiopathic pneumonia syndrome (IPS) will also be described. SOS/VOD 
defined as the presence of at least two of the findings listed below within the first 25 days from transplant:  
 CNI-Free GVHD Prophylaxis Protocol – 1301  
Version 4.0 dated June 22, 2017  
 
 
3-4 • Hyperbilirubinemia (total bilirubin > 2 mg/dL)  
• Hepatomegaly or right upper quadrant pain, or  
• Sudden weight gain (> 5% above baseline)  
 
Clinical suspicion of SOS/VOD after 25 days might require further radiologic evidence of 
compromised portal flow or biopsy to rule out other diagnosis.  
  
IPS is defined as presence of pneumonia like clinical picture with rapid decline of pulmonary function without evidence of infectious etiology, usually occurring within the first 100 days post -
transplant .  
 3.2.12. Infections  
 The incidence of definite and probable viral, fungal and bacterial infections will be tabulated for each intervention arm.  All Grade 2 and 3 infecti ons will be reported according to the BMT CTN 
MOP. Infections of interest, including reactivation of CMV with or without organ involvement 
will be capture and described. Reactivation is defined as the presence of >1000 copies/mL or 500 IU/mL of CMV in the blood by NAAT. In addition, in the CD34- selected arm, reactivation of 
EBV (defined as the presence of >1000 copies in the blood by NAAT) with or without organ involvement will also be captured and described. Organ involvement requires assessment of pathologic specimens.  Furthermore, for CMV and EBV, a decision to institute treatment by the 
patient’s physician will also be considered an infection.  
3.2.13. Immune Reconstitution  
 It is proposed that quanitative assessments of peripheral blood CD3, CD4, CD8, CD19 and CD56 positive lymphocytes will be performed through flow cytometric analysis  at a central lab on 
optional  research samples collected  at Days 35, 100, 180, and 365 after transplant. Qualitative 
assessments will be tabulated according to time from transplant ( see Appendix C).  
 3.2.14. Health -Related Quality of Life  
 HQL will be measured at Baseline and then at Days 100, 180, 365, and 730 post -transplant using 
four instruments: the SF36, FACT -BMT, and MDASI for adult patients (> 18 years), and the 
PedsQL ™ Stem Cell Transplant Module for pediatric patients ( ≥ 8 years through 18 years).  The 
instruments will be scored according to the recommendations of the developers. See section 2.10.1  
for detailed descriptions of the instruments. The FACT -BMT instrument will be summarized by 
the Trial Outcome Index, comprised of the physical, functional, and BMT -specific items.  The 
SF36 will be summarized by the Physical Component Sum mary (PCS) and Mental Component 
Summary (MCS).  HQL will be described and compared between the treatment arms over time.  
Only adult patients able to read and speak in English or Spanish, and pediatric patients able to read 
and speak in English, are eligible  to participate in the HQL component of this trial.

 Subjects will be approached for this study after the decision to proceed with transplantation is made and a suitable HLA -matched donor is identified.  Patients willing to participate in the trial 
will sign an Institutional Review Board approved consent form . For patients with unrelated donors, 
it is recommended a hold for workup request be submitted to the NMDP at this time. Transplant 
physicians will evaluate the patient eligibility for randomization onto this study (see Section 2.3).  
Eligibility criteria will be verified and ineligible patients will not be randomized and no follow -up 
will be obtained . At the time of enrollment, donors wi thout known contraindications  or preferences 
for a specific stem cell source will be selected to donate. Transplant center personnel will record 
the documentation of patient consent  and eligibility criteria  in Emmes  AdvantageEDC
SM 
(Electronic Data Capture, an Internet -based data entry  system) . For patients with unrelated donors, 
the transplant center staff will submit an unrelated donor work up request for the specific stem cell 
graft and dose according to randomization results.  
 
Donors of patients randomized to the CD34+ selection ar m will be required to sign an additional 
donor consent prior to donation. The transplant center personnel will be responsible for consent ing 
related donors to patients randomized to the CD34+ selection arm.  For patients with unrelated 
donors randomized to this arm, a Request for NMDP Donor to Participate in a Research Study 
form must also be submitted to the NMDP.  The NMDP will be responsible for overseeing the 
consent procedures among unrelated donors to patients randomized to the CD34+ selection arm.   
 
4.2. Randomization  
 
Once the patient  is deemed eligible and has given written informed consent, and the transplant 
center has confirmed the donor match grade  by entering the recipient and donor HLA typing in 
AdvantageEDCSM, the patient will be randomized to a treatment arm (CD34 selection, post -
transplant cyclophosphamide or control) . Once the randomization has occurred, the transplant 
center will submit the unrelated donor workup request to the NMDP, or initiate their related donor workup process. Initiation o f conditioning regimens should occur as soon as possible after 
randomization.  
 If there is an unexpected delay in initiation of conditioning, certain pre -transplant evaluations may 
have to be repeated. Refer to section 4.4.1.1 Patient Assessments -Pre-Transplant E valuations. 
 
After  randomization, if the donor changes his or her mind or  refuses to donate the requested graft, 
the patient will be treated according to the  Control  arm, with calcineurin inhibitor -based GVHD 
prophylaxis  (Tax/Mtx) . This patient will be followed for all study outcomes and will be analyzed 
according to  the “intent to treat”  principle in the arm to which the patient was randomized.

4.4.2. Criteria for Forms Submission  
 4.4.2.1. Electronic Case Report Forms (eCRFs)  
 All data for patients are recorded in the electronic Case Report Forms (eCRF) exclusively designed for the study.  The Principal Investigator at e ach of the participating center s are responsible for 
complete, accurate, and timely reporting of data.  
 Criteria for timeliness of submis sion for all study forms are detailed in the Data Management 
Handbook and User’s Guide. Forms that are not entered into AdvantageEDC within the specified 
time will be considered delinquent. A missing form will continue to be requested either until the 
form  is entered into the AdvantageEDC and integrated into the Data and Coordinating Center’s 
(DCC) master database, or until an exception is granted and entered into the Missing Form Exception File, as detailed in the Data Management Handbook.  Corrections in the eCRF are to be conducted only by authorized personnel and may require authorization prior to implementation  of corrections. However, all earlier entries  are retrievable 
despite corrections.  All corrections are recorded automatically concerning date, ti me point and 
person. Plausibility and completeness of the eCRF are verified by  personnel at the Data 
Coordinat ing Center.   
 CNI-Free GVHD Prophylaxis Protocol –  1301  
Version 4.0 dated June 22, 2017  
  
 
4-8 At all times, the Principal  Investigators at the p articipating centers have full responsibility for 
ensuring accuracy and authenticit y of all clinical and laboratory data entered on the eCRFs.  
 
4.4.2.2. Reporting Patient Deaths  
 
Recipient death information must  be entered into AdvantageEDC within 24 hours of knowledge 
of the patient’s death. If the cause of death is unknown at that time, it need not be recorded at that 
time.  However, once the cause of death is determined, the form must be updated in 
AdvantageEDC.  
 4.4.2.3. CIBMTR Data Reporting  
 Centers participating in BMT CTN trials must register pre - and post -transplant outcomes on all 
consecutive hematopoietic stem transplants done at their institution during their time of 
participation to the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR). 
Registration is done using procedures and forms of the Stem Cell Transplant Outcomes Data base 
(SCTOD) (Note: Federal legislation requires submission of these forms for all US allotransplant recipients) . Enrollment on BMT CTN 1301 must be indicated on the SCTOD pre -transplant 
registration form.  Additionally, CIBMTR pre - and post -transplant Repo rt Forms must also be 
submitted for all patients enrolled on this trial.  CIBMTR forms will be submitted directly to the 
CIBMTR at the times specified on the Form Submission Schedule.   4.4.3. Access to Data  
 Participating sites and their Principal Investigators must agree to allow trial- related on -site 
monitoring, including audits and regulatory inspections by DCC personnel such that the DCC has direct access to source data/documents as required.  
 4.4.4. Record Retention  
 Responsibilities of the Sponsor : As required by law, all study documents must be stored by the 
sponsor for at least 10 years after the clinical trial was finished or stopped.  
 Responsibilities of the Principal Investigator : The Investigator agrees to keep records, including 
the identity of all participa ting patients, all original signed informed consent forms, copies of all 
CRFs, source documents, detailed records of treatment disposition and other trial -related 
documents. The trial -related records should be retained by the Investigator for at least 10 y ears or 
as specified by contract, whichever is longer.  In order to comply with the German Transfusion 
Law requirements, all participating German centers must ensure that the information and documents relating to the traceability for all the stages from donation of the hem atopoietic cells to 
infusion into the recipient (including blood products and the graft [bone marrow or PBSC ]) are 
archived in safe custody for a minimum of 30 years, even if the patient withdraws consent.  4.4.5. Study Monitoring 
 
 CNI-Free GVHD Prophylaxis Protocol –  1301  
Version 4.0 dated June 22, 2017  
  
 
4-9 Monitoring and audits will be performed during the clinical study to ensure that the study meets 
the quality criteria.   
 The investigator agrees that the monitor will visit the study center in appropriate intervals. During these visits, the monitor will check the quality  of the data recording and ensure that the study center 
adheres to the timeframe as set in the study protocol. The investigators agree to provide any relevant information and documentation whenever requested by the monitor. This includes access to all orig inal study documents and source data including access to electronic source documents if 
necessary. Source data are checked and compared with entries in the data base. The participant has given consent to this procedure by signing the patient information and written informed consent form.  
 
The monitor has the responsibility to treat all information confidentially and to safeguard the 
integrity and personal privacy of the study participants. 
 
Following a monitoring visit, the Monitor will provide a report to the sponsor and the site, which will summarize the documents reviewed and a statement of findings, deviations, deficiencies, conclusions, actions taken and actions required. The Principal Investigator at each site will be responsible for ensuring that moni toring findings are addressed (this may be delegated to an 
appropriate member of staff).  
 Details of monitoring activities will be included in the Site Monitoring Plan.  
 
4.4.6. Adverse Events  
 4.4.6.1. Adverse Event Definitions  
 Adverse Event -  Any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory 
finding), symptom or disease temporally associated with the use of a medical treatment or procedure regardless of whether it is considered related to the medical treatmen t or procedure 
(attribution of definite, probable, possible, unlikely, or unrelated).  
 Life-Threatening Adverse Event -  Any adverse event that places the participant, in view of the 
investigator, at immediate risk of death from the reaction.  
 Serious Adve rse Event (SAE) -  Any adverse event that results in any of the following outcomes: 
death, a life threatening adverse event, in -patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing 
hospitalization, a persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or a cong enital anomaly/birth 
defect.  
 
Unanticipated adverse device effect (UADE)  - Any serious adverse effect on health or safety, 
any life -threatening problem or death caused by, or associated with a device, if that effect, 
problem, or death was not previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the application; or any other unanticipated serious problem associated with a device that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects.  
 CNI-Free GVHD Prophylaxis Protocol –  1301  
Version 4.0 dated June 22, 2017  
  
 
4-10  
Unexpected Adverse Event -  Any adverse event, the sp ecificity or severity of which is NOT 
listed in the study protocol, product inserts or informed consent document.  Attribution -  The determination of whether an adverse event is related to a medical treatment or 
procedure. Attribution categories: Definite  The adverse event is clearly related  to the study drug/device/procedure/ 
treatment(s).  
 Probable  The adverse event is likely related  to the study drug/device/procedure/ treatment. 
For BMT CTN studies:  the adverse event is not likely to be caused by the su bject’s underlying 
medical condition or other concomitant therapy, and the nature of the adverse event or the 
temporal relationship between the onset of the adverse event and study drug/device/treatment 
administration lead the investigator to believe that there is a reasonable chance of causal 
relationship.  
 
Possible  The adverse event may be related  to the study drug/device/procedure/ 
treatment(s).  
For BMT CTN studies: the adverse event could be attributed to the subject’s underlying medical condition or other concomitant therapy, but the nature of the adverse event or the temporal relationship between the onset of the adverse event and study drug/device/treatment administration lead the investigator to believe that there could be a causal relationship.  
 
Unlikely  The adverse event is doubtfully related  to the study drug/device/ 
procedure/treatment(s).  
 Unrelated  The adverse event is clearly NOT related  to the study drug/device/procedure/ 
treatment(s).  
For BMT CTN studies:  the adverse event is most plausibly explained by the subject’s underlying 
medical condition or other concomitant therapy, or the adverse event has no plausible biological relationship to study drug/device/ treatment.  
 Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events (CTCAE) – a descriptive termin ology developed 
by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) for use in reporting adverse events. The CTCAE includes 
a grading (severity) scale for each adverse event term.  Exhibits 6- 1-1 and 6- 1-2 provide reporting 
requirements for BMT -related complex/multi- component events. A copy of the current CTCAE 
guidelines is located at http://ctep.cancer.gov/reporting/
. 
  
 CNI-Free GVHD Prophylaxis Protocol –  1301  
Version 4.0 dated June 22, 2017  
  
 
4-11 Grade – Severity of the adverse event.  Grades were developed using the following guidelines:  
 
 Grade  0 – No adverse event or within normal limits  
  1 – Mild adverse event  
  2 – Moderate adverse event  
  3 – Severe adverse event  
  4 – Life-Threatening or disabling adverse event  
  5 – Fatal adverse event  
 4.4.6.2. Device Effect Reporting  
 
4.4.6.2.1. Adverse Device Effect Reporting 
 
Unanticipat ed Adverse Device Effects  will be reported via a web -based adverse event (AE) 
system identical to reporting for Unexpected Grade 3 -5 adverse events. Any UADE that is a direct 
result of the C liniMACS CD34 System requires reporting through an expedited AE reporting 
system within 24 hours of the investigator/clinical site becoming aware of the event. The Adverse 
Event Coordinator will review daily all submitted unanticipated adverse device effects and forward 
the information to the Medica l Monitor for review. Refer to section 4.5.5.3. for the remainder of 
reporting procedures. Unanticipated adverse device effects, captured on the AE forms described 
above, require FDA notification via submission of an IDE safety report. The DCC safety group will submit IDE safety reports regarding all unanticipated adverse device effects within 10 days from initial event notification.  
 In addition, any SAE assessed by  the investigator to be a direct result of the CliniMACS CD34 
System requires reporting through an expedited AE reporting system within 24 hours of the investigator/clinical site becoming aware of the event.   
4.4.6.2.2. Reporting of Other Device Events  
 Any device m alfunction, device failure, aborted device run, or product  contamination must be 
reported through the device issues form within 24 hours of  the investigator/clinical site becoming 
aware of the event . Though completion of the form is not required until day 7, sites are expected 
to complete as much information as is available on the form within 24 hours in the event a device malfunction, device failure, aborted device run, or product contamination occurs.  
 4.4.6.3. Adverse Event Reporting 
 Unexpected Adverse Events: Unexpected adverse events will be reported via a web -based 
adverse event (AE) system.  The Adverse Event Coordinator will review daily all submitted 
unexpected adverse events and forward the information to the Medical Monitor for review.  
 Reporting of patie nt adverse events (AE s) will be consistent with the  BMT CTN Manual of 
Procedures  (MOP).  Unexpected, grades 3 -5 AEs , irrespective of the attribution of the event to the 
study drug/device/procedure/treatment,  will be reported through an expedited AE reporting system

to the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), Version 4.0.  
Unexpected, grades 4 -5AEs must be reported within 24 hours of knowledge of the event. 
Unexpected, grade 3 AEs must be reported within three business days of knowledge of the event. 
The NHLBI Data and Safety Monitoring Board will receive summary reports of all adverse 
experiences at least twice yearly . 
 All unexpected adverse events will be reviewed by the Medical Monitor within 2 business days of receiving the summary of the adverse event from the transplant center.  If the Medical Monitor 
requires additional information to make hi s/her assessment, transplant centers will have 4 business 
days to respond to the request for additional information.  
The Medical Monitor has medical expertise relevant to the study protocol and may request the 
participant's treatment assignment when revie wing the adverse event.  A designated person at the 
DCC is responsible for notifying the Project Officer (National Heart Lung and Blood Institute  
[NHLBI]) immediately of all Grade 3 -5 unexpected adverse events and of any concerns regarding 
the frequency or type of adverse event(s) on a study or study treatment arm.  The NHLBI Project 
Officer (or designee) is responsible for reviewing the adverse event materials to determine if the 
materials are complete.  If there are any concerns regarding the type or frequen cy of the event, the 
NHLBI Project Officer will request that the Data Saf ety Monitoring Board (DSMB) Executive 
Secretary notify the DSMB Chair.  The DSMB Chair will review the adverse event materials, 
determine if the information is complete, determine if a dditional DSMB review is required and 
make recommendations to the NHLBI concerning continuation of the study.  Full documentation 
of the procedures will be available at the DCC.  
 The Medical Monitor will review cumulative unexpected grades 3- 5 SAEs on a qua rterly basis 
(data will be reported in a blinded fashion). The Medical Monitor may seek additional guidance 
from one of the DCC Principal Investigators, based on the expertise required, for their assessments as long as the DCC Principal Investigator’s  institution is not participating in the protocol under 
consideration, and the DCC Principal Investigator is not considered to be otherwise in conflict by the NHLBI or by the Steering Committee.  If there any concerns regarding safety, the NHLBI 
Program Director s will be notified immediately.  The Medical Monitor will provide a written 
summary of the safety concern.  
 The DCC will prepare semi -annual summary reports of all unexpected adverse events for the 
NHLBI Project Officer and DSMB Chair.  Semi -annual reports will be made available on a secure 
website and the NHLBI Project Officer and DSMB Chair will be notified by e- mail when the 
materials are posted.  
 Expected Adverse Events: The DCC will prepare semi -annual summary reports of all Grade 5  
expected adverse events for the NHLBI Project Officer and the DSMB Chair.  Semi -annual reports 
will be made available on a secure website and the NHLBI Project Officer and DSMB Chair will be notified by e -mail when the materials are posted.  Grade 3 -5 expected adverse events defined in 
the interim analysis plan will be reported as defined in the protocol. Any concern regarding the 
type or frequency of a Grade 3 -5 expected adverse event will be reported to the NHLBI Project

4-13 Officer who will determine if refer ral to the DSMB is warranted.  If required, data materials will 
be provided by the DCC.  The DSMB Executive Secretary will arrange for review by the DSMB 
Chair.  The Chair will determine if additional DSMB review is required and make 
recommendations to the NH LBI concerning continuation of the study. The DCC will ensure that 
any additional reporting requirements defined by the NHLBI Project Officer, DSMB Chair and 
other oversight groups are identified and implemented. The DCC in collaboration with the NHLBI Project Officer will determine the exact content of these summary reports and the reporting 
schedule.  
 The Protocol Coordinator and Medical Monitor will review the adverse events monitored for stopping guidelines at least monthly.  
 
Additionally, the Protocol  Coordinator and Medical Monitor will review events reported on the 
protocol -specific toxicity form, the GVHD forms and the infection forms on a regular basis (at 
least semi -annually) to assess whether there are safety concerns that should be referred to t he 
DSMB.  The Medical Monitor may seek additional guidance from one of the physicians at the 
DCC in these assessments as long as this physician’s institution is not participating in the 
protocol under consideration.

Version 4.0 dated June 22, 2017  
  
 
5-1 CHAPTER 5  
 
 
5. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 
5.1. Study Design and Objectives  
 The study is designed as a three arm randomized Phase III, multicenter trial comparing two calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) -free strategies for GVHD prophylaxis to one another and to  standard 
tacrolimus and methotrexate (Tac/Mtx) in patients with acute leukemia or myelodysplasia  
undergoing myeloablative conditioning hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.  The target 
enrollment is 345 patients, 115 for each arm.  
 5.1.1. Accrual  
 It is estimated that 42 months  of accrual will be necessary to enroll the targeted sample size.  
 5.1.2. Randomization  
 Patients will be randomized at a ratio of 1:1 :1 between the treatment arms using permuted blocks 
of random sizes. Randomization will be stratified by donor type (sibling vs. unrelated) and age 
(<18 vs. 18- 40 vs. >40) .  
 5.1.3. Primary Endpoint  
 
The primary endpoint is the chronic GVHD free, relapse free survival (CRFS) probability , treated 
as a time to event outcome . The primary analysis will be performed using the intent -to-treat 
principle so that all randomized patients will be included in the analysis.  Development of moderate 
to severe chronic GVHD, relapse, or death will be considered failures for this endpoint , which will 
be adjudicated by a bl inded endpoint review committee. 
 
5.1.4. Primary Hypothesis  
 There are three primary null hypothes es of the study , for the pairwise comparisons of each of the 
two CNI -free strategies (CD34 selection and Post -Transplant  Cy) against the Tac/Mtx control.  
Using HR to denote hazard ratios for the CRFS primary endpoint, the hypotheses are  
 
H
01: HR CD34select vs. Tac/Mtx = 1 vs. H a1: HR CD34select vs. Tac/Mtx  ≠ 1 AND  
H02: HR PostTxCy vs. Tac/Mtx = 1 vs. H a2: HR PostTxCy vs. Tac/Mtx  ≠ 1  AND  
H03: HR CD34select vs. PostTxCy = 1 vs. H a3: HR CD34select vs. PostTxCy ≠ 1  AND  
. 
These three hypotheses will each be tested at the 0.05 / 3 level using a Bonferroni correction to control the overall type I error rate.

Version 4.0 dated June 22, 2017  
  
 
5-2 5.1.5. Duration of F ollow -Up 
 
All patients will be followed for 2 years post -transplant  for primary and secondary endpoints.  
 
5.2. Sample Size and Power Considerations  
 
The primary analysis will be done using log -rank tests for each pairwise comparison, with a type 
I error of 0.05/3 using a Bonferroni correction to account for multiple testing. The primary analysis 
is planned to be conducted when 155 events have been observed for each comparison to control.  
This assumes that the CRFS probabilities in the control group are 46%, 28%, and 22% at 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years, based on CIBMTR data, uses a piecewise exponential survival function to fit 
those CRFS probabilities, and ensures approximately 85% power to detect a hazard ratio of 0.576 (corresponding to a 20% difference in CRFS at 1 year). No stopping rules for efficacy are planned, 
because of the interest in having follow up for overall survival on all patients. However, the study 
design will incorporate interim futility analyses so that one or more of the CNI free arms may be dropped, if the conditional power for the comparison to control under the alternative hypothesis (HR=0.576) is less than 15%. If a treatment group is dropped for futility, the type I error is still 
maintained at 0.05/3 (see further discussion in section 5.5.1.).  We simulated the operating 
characteristics of this design, using uniform accrual of 345 patients over 42 months , 1 year of 
follow up on the last patient enrolled (which is the expected time at which the targeted number of 
events is observed) , follow -up censored at 2 years,  and an interim futility analysis at 2 years, which 
is at approximately 57% of the planned accrual and approximately 45% of the expected number of events.  
 Simulation results are shown in the table below, where groups A and B refer to the CNI -free 
strategies, and group C refers to the control. All tests in the study are two -sided, and the two -sided 
familywise type I error rate is shown in the overall power column of the table when both HR are 1.0. These results indicate that the overall type I error rate is controlled at 5% conservatively, 
primarily due to the impact of the futility analysis which may result in treatment arms being dropped and comparisons not being performed.  Note that since the significanc e level is not 
adjusted for the futility stopping rule, even if the futility stopping rule is not followed exactly the study will still control the type I error rate.  We also looked at type I error for the various pairwise 
comparisons. The two -sided type I  error rate is very low for the CNI -free comparison under the 
overall null hypothesis (all groups have the same CRFS). This is because frequently one or more 
of the treatment groups are dropped, preventing this comparison from occurring. The futility 
analy sis also has an impact on the type I error rate for the pairwise comparisons to control, in the 
sense that the one -sided type I error rate favoring the control is essentially zero due to the futility 
analysis in place.  Therefore, the two -sided type I error  rate is approximately equal to the one- sided 
type I error rate favoring the CNI -free arm.  As expected, the simulations also show that the power 
for each comparison to the control group is maintained at 85%. If a CNI -free approach has no 
impact on CRFS relative to the control group, there is a 48- 49% chance of stopping it early for 
futility.  Note that the power for the CNI -free comparison (A vs. B) is low, but this is mainly due 
to the fact that often one of the arms is closed early for lack of efficacy,  precluding its subsequent 
comparison.

5.3. Interim Analysis and Stopping Guidelines  
 
No formal interim analyses for efficacy will be used.  Although the primary endpoint focuses on 
chronic GVHD through the CRFS endpoint, it is important to get good estimates of the impact of the treatments on a key secondary endpoint of overall survival. Stopping early for efficacy on the 
primary endpoint would negatively impact the precision of our estimate of the hazard ratio for overall mortality.  We also did not include in the design an option for closure of the control group 
while keeping the two treatment arms open, in the event tha t at least one of the treatments 
demonstrate early efficacy.  This would also negatively impact the precision of our estimate of the 
hazard ratio relative to control for a key secondary endpoint of overall mortality. Interim analys es 
for futility will be co nducted at time s coincident with regularly scheduled meetings of the NHLBI -
appointed Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) , starting when approximately 45- 50% of 
the targeted number of events have been observed. The interim analysis for futility is based  on 
conditional power less than 15% under the targeted alternative hypothesis  for the comparisons to 
the control group. Policies and composition of the DSMB are described in the BMT CTN’s Manual 
of Procedures. The stopping guidelines serve as a trigger for  consultation with the DSMB for 
additional review and are not formal “stopping rules” that would mandate automatic closure of study enrollment.  Toxicity, adverse events, and other safety endpoints will be monitored regularly 
and reported to the DSMB at eac h meeting . 
 5.3.1. Guidelines for Safety Monitoring 
 Monitoring of a key safety endpoint will be conducted monthly, and if rates significantly exceed pre-set thresholds, the NHLBI will be notified in order that the DSMB can be advised. Policies 
and composition of  the DSMB are described in the BMT CTN's Manual of Procedures.  The 
stopping guideline serves as trigger for consultation with the DSMB for additional review.  
 The key safety endpoint for this study is mortality.  The rate of mortality will be monitored up to 
100 days post -randomization separately in each of the three treatment arms.  At least three events 
must be observed in order to trigger review. The expected probability of 100 day mortality after a myeloablative transplant is 15- 20%, based on CIBMTR data. Each month, the null hypothesis that 
the 100- day mortality rate is less than or equal to 20% is tested.  An extension of the sequential 
probability ratio test (SPRT) for censored exponential data will be used for monitoring, as described in greate r detail below and in Appendix G . 
 
 CNI-Free GVHD Prophylaxis Protocol –  1301  
Version 4.0 dated June 22, 2017  
  
 
5-4 This sequential testing procedure conserves type I error at 5% across all of the monthly 
examinations for a treatment arm.  The SPRT can be represented graphically.  At each monthly 
interim analysis, the total time on study  in months (x axis)  is plotted against the total number of 
endpoints  (y axis)  (e.g., patients experiencing death).  The continuation region of the SPRT is 
defined by two parallel lines.  Only the  upper  boundary will be used for monitoring to protect 
against excessive 100-day mortality.  If the graph falls above  the upper  boundary, the SPRT rejects 
the null hypothesis, and concludes that there are more events than predicted by the observed time on study. Otherwise, the SPRT continues until enrollment reaches the maximum of 110 patients.  This procedure assumes a censored exponential distribution for the time until death during the first 100 days, and censors follow -up time after 100 days. Only deaths that occur on or before the patient 
has been followed for 100 days are counted. Total time on study is computed as time from 
registration to death, or to 100 days, whichever comes first, summed for all patients on study.  
 
The usual measures of performance of an SPRT are the error probabilities α and β of rejecting H
0 
when θ = θ0 and of accepting H 1 when θ = θ1, respectively, and the expected sample size E(N| θi). 
The tests to be used in this protocol were developed from the following SPRT:   
A SPRT contrasting 20% versus 35% 100- day rate of mortality results in decision bounda ries 
with a common slope of 0.096 and a n upper  intercept of 4.03, with nominal type I and II errors 
of 6% and 15%, respectively.  
 
The actual operating characteristics of the truncated test, shown in Table 5.3, were determined in a simulation study that ass umed uniform accrual of 115 individuals over a 42 month time period, 
and exponential time to failure after randomization.   
 
TABLE 5.3:  OPERATING CHARACTERISTICS OF  SEQUENTIAL TESTING 
PROCEDURE FROM A SIMULATION STUDY WITH 10,000 REPLICATIONS  
  
Day 100 MORTALITY  
 
True 100- Day Rate  20% 30% 35% 
Probability Reject Null  0.046  0.669  0.930  
Mean Month Stopped 44.0 28.2 18.8 
Mean # Endpoints in 100 Days  22.4 21.7 16.6 
Mean # Patients Enrolled  111.8  74.6 50.9 
 For example, the testing procedure rejects the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative 5% of the time when the true 100- day mortality rate is 20%, and 93% of the time when the rate is 35%.  This 
corresponds to a type I error rate of α = 0.05 and a type II error rate of β  = 0.07. When the true 
100-day mortality rate is 35%, on average, the DSMB will be consulted 19 months after opening, 
when 17 events have been observed in 51 patients. 
5.4. Demographic and Baseline Characteristics  
 
 CNI-Free GVHD Prophylaxis Protocol –  1301  
Version 4.0 dated June 22, 2017  
  
 
5-5 Demographics and baseline characteristics will be summarized for all patients.  Characteristics to 
be examined are: age, gender, race/ethnicity, performance status, primary disease/disease risk , 
CMV status, HCT -como rbidity index, time from diagnosis to transplantation, cytogenetic at 
diagnosis (AM L and ALL), HLA matching, and number of regimens prior to transplant 
(lymphoma only). Between group comparisons will be performed for continuous variables via a 
Kruskal -Wall is test and for categorical variables, via the chi- square test.  A secondary analysis of 
all outcomes will adjust for age, performance status, primary disease/disease  risk, and donor type, 
in addition to any other demographic and baseline characteristics wh ich are statistically different 
between treatment arms (p<0.1).    
 
5.5. Analysis Plan  
 
5.5.1. Analysis of the Primary Endpoint  
 The primary outcome of the trial is CRFS, treated as a time to event variable.  There are three 
primary pairwise comparisons between the CNI -free strategies and the Tac/Mtx control group, 
each to be tested at a Bonferroni adjusted significance level of 0.05/3. We do not use adaptive 
design strategies to modify the multiplicity adjustment if a treatment group is dropped for futility at an interi m analysis.  This allows us to directly apply gatekeeping strategies to control the 
familywise type I error rate also across a key secondary endpoint of overall survival, as described in 5.5.2.2. These comparisons  of CRFS  will be done using pairwise log -rank tests, applied to the 
primary intent- to-treat population of all randomized patients.  The hazard ratio, along with 
confidence intervals, will be estimated from a Cox model with treatment as a covariate.  Kaplan -
Meier estimates of CRFS will also be described for each group, along with confidence intervals at 1 and 2 years. A secondary analysis of CRFS will be conducted using Cox regression, adjusting 
for donor type, age, performance status, and primary disease/disease risk, in addition to any other demographic and baseline characteristics which are statistically different between treatment arms (p<0.1).   
 5.5.2. Analysis of Secondary Endpoints  
 Overall survival will be a key secondary endpoint, with an analysis plan which ensures control of the overall type I error rate, as described below.  All other secondary endpoints will be considered 
exploratory without explicit control of the type I error rate, and the analyses of these endpoints will use the transplanted populations rather than the ITT population. All time to event endpoints 
below will also have secondary analyses using Cox regression, adjusting for donor type, age, performance status, and primary disease/disease status, in addition to any other demographic and baseline characteristics which are statistically different between treatment arms (p<0.1).  Details of 
the analyses are provided below.

Version 4.0 dated June 22, 2017  
  
 
5-6 5.5.2.1. Relapse- Free S urvival  
 
Relapse- free survival curves will be estimated using the Kaplan -Meier estimator , and compared 
between treatment groups using the log -rank test . Hazard ratios, along with confidence intervals, 
will be estimated from a Cox model with treatment group as a covariate.  
 5.5.2.2. Overall S urvival  
 Overall survival will be a key secondary endpoint, with explicit control of the type I error rate through a gatekeeper approach. Formal significance testing of OS between a CNI -free strategy and 
the control will be conducted if the corresponding CRFS comparison is significant.  This OS 
comparison will be done using a Bonferroni adjusted significance level of 0.05/3 to account for 
three potential CNI -free comparisons to the control. Otherwise, survival analyses will be 
considered exploratory.  Overall survival curves will be estimated using the Kaplan -Meier 
estimator  applied to the ITT population, and compared between treatment groups using the log-
rank test . The hazard ratio, along with confidence intervals, will be estimated from a Cox model 
with treatment group as a covariate.  Overall survival will also be described in each arm from the 
time of transplant.  
 
5.5.2.3. Transplant -Related M ortality  
 Incidence of TRM will be estimated using the cumulative incidence function, treating relapse/progression as a competing risk. Incidence of TRM will be compared between the 
treatment arms using Gray’s test
71.  
 5.5.2.4. Immunosuppression- Free S urvival  
 Proportions of patients alive, relapse free, and off immune suppression at one year will be described for each group, and compared using the chi -square test.  If there is censoring prior to one 
year, multistate models will be constructed to estimate these probabilities.  Agreement between this 
endpoint and the primary endpoint of CRFS will be described using cross -tabulation f requencies 
and assessed using the Kappa statistic.   
 5.5.2.5. Disease R elapse  
 Incidence of relapse will be estimated using cumulative incidence function, treating death in remission as a competing risk. Incidence of relapse will be compared between the treatment arms 
using Gray’s test.   
 5.5.2.6. Hematologic R ecovery  
 Incidence of neutrophil and platelet engraftment from the time of transplant will be estimated using the cumulative incidence function with death prior to engraftment as the competing risk. Incidence 
of neutrophil engraftment at 28 days and incidence of platelet engraftment at 60 days will be 
 CNI-Free GVHD Prophylaxis Protocol –  1301  
Version 4.0 dated June 22, 2017  
  
 
5-7 compared between the treatment arms using a pointwise comparison of the cumulative incidence 
probabilities.    
 5.5.2.7. Graft Failure  
 Primary graft failure will be assessed as a secondary endpoint.  The proportion of patients who do 
not achieve neutrophil recovery to > 500 cells/µL by Day 28 post HSCT will be computed for each treatment arm and compared between the treatment arms using the Z test for binomial pro portions.  
Secondary graft failure will be assessed as a secondary endpoint using cumulative incidence  
function.  The cumulative incidence of secondary graft failure at 2 years post -transplant will be 
computed along with 95% confidence intervals and compar ed between the treatment arms using 
Gray’s test.  Patients will be considered as reaching the endpoint if the initial neutrophil 
engraftment is followed by subsequent decline in absolute neutrophil counts <  500 cells/µL, is 
unresponsive to growth factor therapy, and cannot be explained by disease  relapse or medications.  
Death prior to secondary graft failure will be considered as a competing risk.  
 
5.5.2.8. Acute GVHD of G rades II -IV and III -IV 
 Cumulative incidence of acute GVHD will be estimated from the time of transplant using the cumulative incidence function, treating death prior to acute GVHD as the competing risk.  
Cumulative incidence of acute GVHD will be compared between treatment arms using Gray’s test.  
 5.5.2.9. Chronic GVHD  
 Cumulative incidence of chronic GVH D from the time of transplant will be estimated using the 
cumulative incidence function, treating death prior to chronic GVHD as the competing risk. Cumulative incidence of chronic GVHD will be compared between treatment arms using Gray’s test.   5.5.2.10. Chronic G VHD- Free S urvival  
 Chronic GVHD -free survival curves will be estimated using the Kaplan -Meier estimator , and 
compared between treatment groups using the log -rank test . Hazard ratios, along with confidence 
intervals, will be estimated from a Cox model with treatment group as a covariate.  
 
5.5.2.11. Incidence of T oxicities G rade ≥  3 per CTCAE V ersion 4.0 
 
All Grade ≥  3 toxicities will be tabulated by grade for each treatment arm, by type of toxicity as 
well as the peak grade overall.  Toxicity frequencies will be descri bed for each time interval as well 
as cumulative over time.   
 
5.5.2.12. Incidence of Infections  
 The number of infections and the number of patients experiencing infections will be tabulated by type of infection, severity, and time period after transplant. The cumulative incidence of severe, 
 CNI-Free GVHD Prophylaxis Protocol –  1301  
Version 4.0 dated June 22, 2017  
  
 
5-8 life-threatening, or fatal infections, treating death as a competing event, will be compared between 
the treatment arms using Gray’s test .  
 
5.5.2.13. Immune R econstitution  
 It is proposed that quantitative assessment of peripheral blood CD3, CD4, CD8, CD19 and CD56 positive lymphocytes will be performed for each randomized treatment arm at the specified time 
points assessed after transplant (days 35, 100, 180 and 365). Analysis of effector and regulatory 
T-cell subsets will also be described in the sub -cohort of adult patients sending samples to a 
centralized lab.  Correlations among the lymphocyte populations will be explored using rank 
correlations.  Analysis will be done separately for each immune reconstitu tion measurement using 
a Bonferroni adjusted significance level (0.05/7).  Log transformations will be considered to induce 
normality in the lymphocyte subset counts. Partly conditional regression conditioning on being 
alive at each time point will be imple mented using GEE to compare the longitudinal immune 
reconstitution measurements over time between the treatment groups
72 . Interactions with time will 
be tested for and if significant, treatment effects will be estimated separately for each time point. The missing data pattern of the immune reconstitution lab measurements will be examined using 
graphical techniques and logistic regression models conditional on survival, and if necessary 
inverse probability of censoring weighted GEE
73 will be used to account f or missing data.  We 
anticipate at least 50 samples per treatment arm being available at each time point, even in the 
adult sub- cohort, based on anticipated 63% overall survival at one year. This sample size will yield 
at least 85% power to detect a 2 fold increase in cell counts between treatment arms, assuming a 0.95 SD in the log cell counts, a value consistent with our preliminary data. Additional lymphocyte 
subsets will also be analyzed in the adult sub- cohort in an exploratory fashion using similar 
methods, except that a false discovery rate controlling procedure will be used to account for 
multiple testing.
74 In addition to comparing immune reconstitution among the three groups, we 
will also examine how changes in lymphocyte subpopulations are associate d with subsequent 
clinical outcomes, including development of acute and chronic GVHD, survival, CRFS, relapse, and infection. Cox multivariate regression will be performed using landmark analysis or time dependent covariates to model the relationship betwe en the most recent cell count or change in 
cell count and the development of subsequent events.   5.5.2.14. Health -Related Quality of life  
 HQL will be measured at Baseline and then at Days 100 180, 365, and 730 post -transplant  using 
six instruments : the SF36 (both PCS and MCS), FACT -BMT, and MDASI  for English and Spanish 
speaking adult patients (> 18 years), and the Peds QL™ Stem Cell Transplant Module  for English 
speaking pediatric patients ( ≥ 8 years through 18 years) . HQL at each time point will be 
summarized using simple descriptive statistics (mean, SD).  Analysis will be done separately for 
each instrument using a Bonferroni adjusted significance level (0.05/4). All models will be 
adjusted for baseline HQL. Partly conditional regression conditioning on being alive at each time 
point will be used to compare the longitudinal HQL measurements over time between the treatment groups.
72 Interactions with time will be tested for and if significant, treatment effects will be 
estimated separately for each time point.  The missing data pattern of the HQL measurements will 
be examined using graphical techniques and logistic regression models conditional on survival . At

Version 4.0 dated June 22, 2017  
  
 
5-9 each time point, estimates of the difference in HQL between the treatments conditional on survival 
at that time point will be obtained using inverse probability of censoring weight ed GEE  with 
independent estimating equations73 to account for missing data.   
 
5.5.2.15. Subgroup Analysis  
 
Subgroup analyses will be conducted for CRFS  according to disease, disease risk and age.  
Interaction tests between treatment group and subgroup will be conducted within a Cox proportional hazards regression model  with treatment, subgroup, and a treatment*subgroup 
interaction term.  A Bonferroni adjusted significance level of 0.05/3=0.0167 will be used for each 
interaction te st to account for multiple testing.  If a significant interaction is identified, plots of 
Kaplan -Meier estimates of CRFS by treatment will be shown separately for each level of the 
subgroup, and a forest plot will be used to show the HR’s for each subgroup.

6. ETHICS AND REGULATORY  
 
6.1. Good Clinical Practice Guidelines  
 
The DCC and the clinical investigators assure that the clinical study is performed in accordance with the protocol, the ICH Harmonized Tripartite Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice 1996, the Declaration of Helsinki (Recommendations guiding physicians in Biomedical Research involving Human Subjects, Helsinki 1964, amended Tokyo 1975, Venice 1983, Hong Kong 1989, Somerset West 1996, Edinburgh, 2000, Seoul 2008, Fortaleza 2013) and applicable regulatory requirements.  
 6.1.1. Patient Consent  
 Candidates for the study will be identified as described in Chapter 4 of the protocol. The Principal 
Investigator or his/her designee at each transplant cent er will contact the candidates, provide the 
patient with information about the purpose of the study and obtain consent. The BMT CTN will 
provide a template of the consent form to each center. Each center will customize the template 
according to their local  requirements and submit it for review by the local Internal Review Board 
(IRB).  The DCC will verify the adequacy of the consent forms prior to submission to the IRB. 
Each center must provide evidence of IRB approval.  
6.1.2. Patient Withdrawal 
 6.1.2.1. Patient W ithdrawa l from I ntervention  
 Participation in the trial is voluntary. Patients will be advised that they may voluntarily withdraw from the study at any time and will be instructed to notify the investigator. Patients may choose to withdraw for any reason(s). Patie nts are not obligated to reveal their reason(s) for withdrawal to 
the sponsor.   6.1.2.2. Patient W ithdrawal from D ata C ollection  
 If a patient explicitly states they do not wish to contribute further data to the trial their decision must be respected and notified to the sponsor in writing. In this event details should be recorded 
in the patient’s hospital records, no further CRFs must be completed and no further data sent to the sponsor.  6.1.2.3. Patient Removal f rom Study  
 The investigator has the right to terminate the p articipation of any subject at any time, if s/he deems 
it in the participant’s best interest. The reason and circumstances for study discontinuation will be documented by the site and sent to the DCC. Reasons for study discontinuation might be:  
 CNI-Free GVHD Prophylaxis Protocol –  1301  
Version 4.0 dated June 22, 2017  
  
 
6-2 • Intolerable  side effects of the study product. 
• Changes in medical status of the patient such that the Investigator believes that patient 
safety will be compromised or that it would be in the best interest of the patient to stop 
treatment.  
• Pregnancy.  
• Withdrawal of consent.  
• Relevant non- compliance with the protocol.  
 6.1.3. Confidentiality  
 Confidentiality will be maintained by individual names being masked and assigned a patient identifier code upon enrollment in AdvantageEDC. The code relaying the patient’s identity with the ID code will be kept separately at the center.   
 6.1.4. Participation of Women and Minorities  
 Women and ethnic minorities and other populations will be included in this study. Accrual of women and minorities at each center will be monitored to determine whether  their rates of 
enrollment are reflective of the distribution of potentially eligible women and minorities expected from data reported to the CIBMTR and from published data on incidence of acute leukemia and myelodysplasia in these groups. Centers will be notified if their rates differ significantly from those expected and asked to develop appropriate recruitment reports.  
 
6.1.5. NMDP Unrelated Donors  
 The National Marrow Donor Program (NMDP) IRB will be responsible for the review and continuing oversight of protocol procedures that relate only to NMDP unrelated donors.  
 6.1.6. International Unrelated Donor Consent  
 
Donor research consent may be waived for international donors if the country of the donor 
registry does not consider such donors to be research subjects. How ever, the donor must meet all 
donor -eligibility criteria for the study and must consent to donation as per requirements of the 
collecting donor registry and regulations of the country of donation.  
6.2. Protocol Amendments  
 
All protocol amendments containing substantive changes must be reviewed and accepted by members of the DSMB before distribution to Clinical Centers.  The review may take place at a 
DSMB meeting, on an arranged conference call, or by ballot.   
 
Once approved by the DSMB, participating centers (a nd the FDA if applicable) will be notified of 
approved protocol amendments by an e -mail announcement from the DCC. Amendment 
documents may be included with the e -mail announcement and will be posted on the BMT CTN 
website.  The documents will include:  
 CNI-Free GVHD Prophylaxis Protocol –  1301  
Version 4.0 dated June 22, 2017  
  
 
6-3  
1. A summary of protocol changes  
2. A revised protocol with changes highlighted  
3. A second version with the changes fully incorporated into the document  
4. A rationale for changes may be provided  
 
Other types of amendments containing non- substantive changes may be released to Centers before 
DSMB notification or deliberation. These changes will be reviewed at the next regularly scheduled 
DSMB meeting or conference call.  
 The DCC PIs will determine the appropriate review process in collaboration with the NHLBI Project Off icer. 
 
Clinical Centers are responsible for implementing all amendments according to institutional 
policy.  
 
6.3. Protocol Deviations  
 
Clinical centers should inform the DCC of any major protocol deviations. These will be submitted 
to the DSMB on a semi -annual basis.  
 
6.4. Premature Termination of the Trial  
 
The sponsor has the right to discontinue the study due to relevant medical or administrative 
reasons. Participants who still receive medication during the time of discontinuation will undergo a final visit which h as to be documented in the CRF.  
 
Possible reasons for discontinuation by the sponsor are:  
• failure in recruiting participants,  
• data quality is insufficient,  
• unforeseen circumstances at the study site that make the continuation of the study 
impossible,  
• early  prove of superiority or non- inferiority of a treatment group,  
• occurrence of unjustifiable risks or toxicity,  
• new scientific knowledge that does not justify continuation of the clinical study.

1. Introduction  
We invite you to join this clinical trial, also known as a research  study.  We are doing this study 
because we want to compare three transplant procedures  to see which is better at preventing 
Graft -versus -Host Disease (GVHD). You are being asked to join this study because:  
1. You have a disease that can be treated by an allog eneic blood or marrow  stem cell 
transplant; and  
2. Your doctor plans on using a standard  intensity conditioning  regimen for your transplant.  
 This study will take at least two (2) years and will include 345 participants  – 115 participants in 
each of three (3) treatment groups .  
 This Consent Form will tell you about the purpose of the study, the  possible risks and benefits, 
other options available to you, and your rights as a participant in the study.

2. Study Background  
The National Institutes of Health (NIH), through the Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network (BMT CTN),  are providing staff support and money for this research study. The 
BMT CTN and the NIH will make decisions about how to manage the study.  Miltenyi Biotec , a 
company th at produces a device used to process the stem cells before administering in patients , is 
also supporting this study with supplies and money.  
 A hematopoietic  stem cell transplant  (HSCT) is a standard therapy for blood cancers such as 
acute leukemias and myelodysplastic disorders.  A common problem that may occur after HSCT  
is a condition known as Graft -Versus -Host Disease ( GVHD) . The word “graft” refers to the 
donor blood cells that you will receive during your transplant. The word “host” refers to the person (in this case, you) receiving the cells.  GVHD is a complication w here the donor graft 
attacks and damages some of your (the transplant recipient's) tissues. It has two basic forms, an 
acute form which tends to occur rapidly and is most common in the first three months after the transplant and a chronic  form , which devel ops slowly and at a later time after transplant.   
• GVHD can cause skin rash, intestinal problems such as nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea,  
• It may also damage your liver and cause hepatitis or jaundice.   
• GVHD may also increase your risks of infection. 
• Chronic GVHD can affect many organs and causes significant impact on the quality of life 
of patients.

3. Study Purpose  
We are inviting you to take part in this study because you have acute leukemia or 
myelodysplasia,  and a  hematopoietic  stem cell transplant is a treatment option.  
 
The purpose of this study is to compare three  different combinations of  treatment plans to see 
whether one or more of them are better than a standard transplant procedure . The procedures 
being studied have the objective to reduce the occurrence of chronic GVHD.  The procedures 
included in this clinical trial are:  
Treatment Group A : CD34 S elected Peripheral Blood Stem Cell  Transplant  
Treatment Group B : Bone Marrow Transplant followed by Post -Transplant  
Cyclophosphamide  
Treatment Group C : Bone Marrow Transplant with Tacrolimus and M ethotrexate as 
GVHD Prevention  
 Doctors primarily want to compare Groups A and B with Group C (control) . The study will help 
doctors make choices about transplants procedures with fewer chronic GVHD complications  for 
patients.  
  
4. Right to Ask Questions and/or Withdraw  
You have the right to ask questions about t he study at any time.  If you have questions about your 
rights as a participant or you want to leave the study, please contact:  [insert contact info ] 
 Being in this study is voluntary. You can choose not to be in this study or leave this study at any 
time.  If you choose not to take part or leave this study, it will not affect your regular medical care 
in any way.  
 Your study doctor and study staff will be ava ilable to answer any questions that you may have 
about taking part in or leaving this study.  
  
5. Study Treatment and Tests  
We will check your health before you start treatment, while you receive treatment, and for two  
years after transplant .  
 
Before You Begin the Study  
Before you begin  the study, you will need to have several exams, tests or procedures to find out 
if you can be in the study. All patients participating in this study need to have a matched donor. Most of t hese exams, tests or procedures are part of regular cancer care and may be done even if 
you do not join the study.  These include:

 Physical examination,  including height and weight  
 Blood and urine tests  
 Heart function tests, including EKG and ejection fraction  
 Lung (pulmonary ) function tests  
 Tests to evaluate your cancer, including a bone marrow aspirate/biopsy  
 Chest X -ray or chest CT  
 A pregnancy test if you are a woman able to have children. If you are pregnant, you will 
not be able to take part in this study.  
If you join the  study, the study -specific assessments listed below will be done before you begin 
the con ditioning regimen : 
 Health quality of life questionnaires  (for English and Spanish speaking adult patients ≥  18 
years of age  and English speaking pediatric patients, ag es 8 to 18 years ). 
 Optional  blood samples for future research (see Section 18: Blood Samples for Future 
Research )  
 
Study Participation  
If you decide to join the study, your participation will last for 2 year s after your transplant. We 
will ask you to sign this Consent Form and you will get a copy of the signed form to keep.  
 
Randomization  
We will use a computer to randomly assign you to 1 of 3 treatment groups. You will have an equal chance of being placed i n 1 of the 3 groups. Neither you nor your doctor or study investigator will 
have any control over which treatment group you will be assigned.  
 
During Your Tr ansplant  
The treatments that are used to prevent GVHD either start before or after the infusion of stem cells. These treatments are a combination of immune suppressing drugs and a standard component of the transplant.  
 The 3 treatment groups being included in this study are outlined below:  
Treatment Group A: CD 34 Selected Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Gra ft 
• Conditioning regimen: your doctor will select one of two conditioning regimens 
that are allowed in this treatment group. One includes total body irradiation plus 
chemotherapy, and the other include s chemotherapy  alone.  
• The donor graft will be periphera l blood stem cells.  
• The donor graft will be processed through a device that removes cells that are associated with the development of GVHD.  
 CNI-Free GVHD Prophylaxis Protocol –  1301  
Version 4.0 dated June 22, 2017  
  
 
B-6 Treatment Group B: Post -Transplant  Cyclophosphamide  
• Conditioning regimen: your doctor will choose one of three conditioning regimens 
allowed in this treatment group.  
• The donor graft will be bone marrow.  
• After your transplant:  
o Cyclophosphamide will be given by intravenous infusion (through your vein), 
over 1- 2 hours, on Day  3 and Day  4 after your transplant . 
Treatment Group C: Tacrolimus and Methotrexate  
• Conditioning regimen: your doctor will choose one of four conditioning regimens 
allowed in this treatment group.  
• Before your transplant:  
o Tacrolimus will be given as a pill by mouth or by intravenous infusion (through 
your vein) twice a day, beginning three (3) days before your transplant. The 
amount of drug given will slowly be decreased and eventually stopped. This 
process occurs over several months. 
• The donor graft will be bone marrow.  
• After your transplant:  
o Methotrexate will be given by intravenous infusion (through your vein) on four (4) different days (1, 3, 6 and 11) after your transplant. 
 Both Treatment G roups A and B do not require long term use of medication to suppress the 
immune system.  
 
Peripheral Blood Stem Cell or Bone Marrow Transplant  
On your transplant day, the bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cells will be given to you through your catheter, like a blood transfusion. The cells will travel to your bone marrow where they will star t to make healthy, new blood cells after several weeks.  
 
Health Evaluations After the Transplant  
We will test (evaluate) your health during the study. These tests and how often they are scheduled are standard care for patients receiving an allogeneic tran splant. Most of these would be done even 
if you were not part of this study. You will be watched closely for any signs and symptoms of 
GVHD.  
• Physical exam to assess toxicities, and infections weekly until Day 63 and then at Days 
100, 150, 180, 270, 365 and 730. 
• Physical exam to assess GVHD weekly starting Day 7 until Day 63 and then at Days 100, 150, 180, 270, 365 and 730. 
• Routine blood tests (cell counts, liver and kidney function) weekly until Day 63 and then at Days 100, 180, 270, and 365. 
 CNI-Free GVHD Prophylaxis Protocol –  1301  
Version 4.0 dated June 22, 2017  
  
 
B-7 • Blood tests to monitor for CMV and EBV weekly until Day 100 and then at each clinical 
assessment until Day 180. 
• Restaging test s to see how much cancer you have after transplant  on Day s 100, 180, 365 
and 730.  
• Health q uality of life questionnaires after the  transplant  on Days 100, 180, 365 and 730 
(for English and Spanish speaking adult patients ≥  18 years of age  and English speaking 
pediatric patients, ages 8 -18 years ). 
• Optional  blood samples for  future  research after transplant on Days 35, 100, 180 and 365 
(see Section 18: Blood Samples for  Future  Research ).  
 
6. Health Quality of Life (for English and Spanish speaking adult patients , and 
English speaking pediatric patients only)  
We will ask you about your general health and how well you feel while you participate in this 
study.  Even though different treatments may treat a disease equally well, there might be a 
difference in how patients feel or the side effects they have after their treatment.  This is 
important information for when we evaluate the treat ments in this study.  
 We will collect information by using surveys. The surveys will ask about:  
 How you feel  
 What symptoms you might have and how they affect you  
 How well can you do regular daily activities  
 You will need to fill out the surveys and each s urvey should take about 30 minutes to finish. 
Your answers will help us understand how your transplant treatment affects how you feel, what you can do, and your general quality of life.  
 
7. Risks and Discomforts  
You will have side effects while on the study. Side effects can range from mild to serious.  
The risks and discomforts of participating in this study will be similar to what you may have 
with stem cell transplant if you do not participate in this study, but you might do better or worse than on standar d transplant treatment.  Your health care team may  give you medicines to help 
lessen  side effects  such as feeling sick to your stomach (nausea)  among other support treatments . 
In some cases, side effects can be long lasting or may never go away.  
 
Risks  and Toxicities  Related to  Conditioning Regimens  
The table below describes all conditioning regimens that are allowed to be used in this clinical trial. The regimen you will receive depends on the treatment group you will be assign ed and your 
doctor ’s choice. Some of these regimens are used in transplants performed outside a clinical trial.

conditioning regimen are listed below. The expected frequency of each of t hese side effects is  
shown in T able 2.  
 
TABLE 2  - RISKS AND SIDE EFFECTS  
Likely  What it means: This type of side effect is expected to occur in more than 20% of 
patients. This means that 21 or more patients out of 100 might get this side effect.  
Less Likely  What it means: This type of side effect is expected to occur in 20% of patients or 
fewer. This means that 20 patients or fewer out of 100 might get this side effect.  
Rare, but Serious  What it means: This type of side effect does not occur very often – in fewer than 
2% o f patients – but is serious when it occurs. This means that 1 or 2 patients (or 
fewer) out of 100 might get this side effect.

Risks  and Toxicities Related to GVHD Prophylaxis  
If you were assigned to the CD34 Selection Arm and your cells are selected with the CliniMACS® 
CD34 Reagent System, you may receive low doses of iron, iron- dextran and monoclonal antibody 
when the selected cells a re re-infused.  Our experience shows that these low doses are unlikely to 
cause any bad side effects, including cancer.  
 
If you were assigned to the control group (treatment group  C) you will receive medications to help 
prevent the development of GVHD.

Risks and Toxicities Related to Transplant  
The following problems may occur as a result of stem cell  transplant ation . These risks may occur 
whether a transplant was done as part of the study or not:  
 
Slow recovery of blood counts. The red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets can be slow 
to recover after blood or marrow transplant. Until your blood counts recover, you will need blood and platelet transfusions, and will be at risk for bleeding and infections. To speed the recovery of the white cells as much as possible you may  receive Filgrastim.   
 
Graft failure. The stem cells (the “graft”) may fail to grow inside your body. Past experience 
suggests that there can be up to a 10 -15% chance of graft failure. If graft failure occurs, this may 
result in low blood counts for a long period of time. If your counts do not recover, you may need to 
receive a second transplant. Graft failure can be fatal.  
 
Graft -Versus -Host Disease (GVHD). GVHD results from cells in the graft recognizing  your body 
as foreign and attacking it. In most cases, GVHD can be successfully treated. Sometimes GVHD is 
severe or difficult to treat and may lead to death. You will be watched closely for this complication and given drugs to prevent and/or treat it.  
 CNI-Free GVHD Prophylaxis Protocol –  1301  
Version 4.0 dated June 22, 2017  
  
 
B-13  
Acute GVHD may produce skin rash, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, abnormalities of liver function, and an increased risk of infection. Chronic GVHD may produce skin rashes, hair loss, thickened dry skin, dry eyes, dry mouth, liver disease, weig ht loss, diarrhea, and an increased risk of 
infection. To confirm the diagnosis of acute  or chronic GVHD, you may be asked to have a biopsy (a 
small sample of your tissue to look at under the microscope) of your skin, gut, or, rarely, your liver.  
 Other complications. Other complications may include:  
a. Damage to the vital organs in your body. The transplant could cause problems in any body organ such as the heart, lungs, liver, gut, kidneys and bladder, or brain. The kidneys and the liver are most likely to be damaged. Some patients will experience serious lung problems from infections or the chemotherapy and radiation.  
b. Serious infections. Full and complete recovery of your immune system may take many months. 
During this time, there is an increased risk of i nfections. You will be prescribed certain drugs to 
reduce the chance of those infections. However,  these treatments do not always work. If you 
have an infection, you may have to stay in the hospital longer or be re -hospitalized after 
transplant. Although m ost infections can be successfully treated, some infections may result in 
death.  
c. Relapse of disease or a new blood cancer. Your  leukemia  may come back even if the 
transplant is initially successful. In rare cases, a new blood cancer may develop from the d onor 
cells. Cyclophosphamide can cause damage to blood cells, which may result in a blood 
cancer such as myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The 
blood cancer usually develops 2- 10 years after treatment, or 6 years on average. Th e risk of 
developing a new blood cancer after allogeneic blood or marrow transplant is probably less than 2%. If cancer develops in your donor’s blood cells, you may require additional treatment with chemotherapy or another blood or marrow transplant. 
d.  Lym phoproliferative Syndrome:  Patients in Treatment Group A (CD34 Selected Peripheral 
Blood Stem Cell Graft) have an increased risk of developing post -transplant lymphoproliferative 
disorder (PTLD) or lymphoma caused by a virus called EBV.  They can develop sy mptoms like 
fevers and enlarged lymph nodes. Your doctor may use scans and biopsies to confirm the 
diagnosis. Your blood will be monitored to check if you have signs of EBV in the blood. In 
many patients EBV can be treated at that stage before it ever progresses to lymphoma. EBV in 
the blood or EBV lymphoma often responds to treatment with rituximab, a drug commonly used in other lymphomas. PTLD can be fatal.  
e. Risk to the unborn. The treatments in this study have not been proven to be safe at any stage o f 
pregnancy. Therefore, if you are pregnant or nursing, you are not eligible for this study. Women who can become pregnant must use effective birth control while receiving chemotherapy, TBI, and drugs to prevent GVHD , and for 1 year after transplant . Effec tive birth control is defined as 
the following:  
1. Refraining from all acts of vaginal sex (abstinence)  
2. Consistent use of birth control pills  
 CNI-Free GVHD Prophylaxis Protocol –  1301  
Version 4.0 dated June 22, 2017  
  
 
B-14 3. Injectable birth control methods (Depo- Provera, Norplant)  
4. Tubal sterilization or male partner who has undergone a vasectomy  
5. Placement of an IUD (intrauterine device)  
6. Use of a diaphragm with contraceptive jelly and/or condoms with contraceptive foam 
every time you have sex.  
 
Reproductive Risks  
The drugs used in thi s research study may  damage your rep roductive organs, affect your ability to 
have children  or possibly cause birth defects if you take them while you are pregnant. I t is 
important that a woman is  not pregnant or breast -feeding and do es not become pregnant during 
the course of the study.  
It is important that both women  who can become pregnant and their male partners  use 
birth control for 1 year after transplantation  while on this study . 
 
If you are a woman and can become pregnant , you will need to take a pregnancy test before you 
start the study . You should discuss ways to prevent pregnancy while you are in  the study. 
Women who have gone through puberty may find that their menstrual cycle becomes irregular or 
stops permanently. This does not mean that you cannot become pregnant. You must sti ll use an 
effective method of birth control during your transplant and continue until you are finished with your GVHD prevention treatment.  
 If you are a man, your body may not be able to produce sperm (become sterile). You should talk with your doctor about banking your sperm before having a transplant.  Please check with your doctor to understand more about these risks.  
 
Unforeseen Risks  
New risks might appear at any time during the study . These risks might be different from what is 
listed in this Consen t Form. We will promptly tell you about  new information that may affect 
your decision to take part in the study . We may learn new things that might make you want to stop 
being in the study. We will let you know if this happens and you can decide if you want to continue 
in the study .  
 
Other Treatments or Medications  
Some medicines react with each other, and it is important that you tell the study doctor or staff about any other drugs, treatments, or medicines you are taking. This includes non- prescription 
medications, vitamins and herbal treatments.  
 It is also important that you tell the study staff about any changes to these medications during your participation in the study.  
 For more information about risks and side effects, ask your study doctor.

B-15 7. Alternative Treatments  
Participation in this study is optional.  If you choose not to take part, you may still receive an 
allogeneic transplant to treat your disease.  The treatment and evaluations you would receive 
could be very similar to what would receive if you join this study.  
 
Your study doctor will talk with you about your options. If you decide not to participate in this 
study, your medical care will not be affected in any way.  
 Your other choices may include:  
 Treatment with other drugs, radiation, or a combination of drugs and radiation without a transplant. 
 An allogeneic blood or marrow  transplant that is not part of the study , or another type of 
transplant  
 Participation in another clinical trial, if available ( check with your doctor)  
 No treatment for your blood cancer at this time  
 Comfort care  
 Every treatment option has benefits and risks . Talk with your doctor about your treatment 
choices before you decide if you will take part in this study.  
 
 
8. Possible Benefits 
Takin g part in this study may or may not make your health better. The information from this 
study will help doctors learn more about medications used to prevent GVHD. 
 
 
9. New Information Available During the Study 
During this research study, the study doctors m ay learn about new information about the study 
drugs or the risks and benefits of the study. If this happens, they will tell you about the new 
information.  The new information may mean that you can no longer participate in the study, or that 
you may not wa nt to continue in the study.  
 If this happens, the study doctor will stop your participation in the study and will offer you all available care to suit your needs and medical conditions.

Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act:  
A new federal law (2009), called the Gen etic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA), 
generally makes it illegal for health insurance companies, group health plans, and employers of 15 
or more persons to discriminate against you based on your genetic information. Health insurance 
companies and group health plans may not request your genetic information that we get from this 
research.  This means that they must not use your genetic information when making decisions 
regarding insurability.  Be aware that this new federal law will not protect you aga inst genetic 
discrimination by companies that sell life insurance, disability insurance, or long -term care 
insurance.

B-19 18. Optional  Blood Samples for Future  Research  
This section of the informed consent form is about optional  future research studies . This 
research will be done using blood samples from patients  who are taking part in the main 
study described above.  You may give  blood samples for these research studies i f you want 
to. You can still be a part of the main study even if you say 'no' to giving blood samples for 
these research studies.  You can say "yes" or "no" to giving these optional blood samples 
for research . Please mark your choice at the end of this sect ion. 
 
We would like to have  five (5) blood samples for  future research  studies . If you agree, these 
samples will be drawn before you begin the conditioning regimen for your transplant (2 teaspoons or 6 mL), and at 4 different times after your transplant on Days 35, 100, 180, and 365 (20 teaspoons or 86 mL at each  time point). These samples will only be collected in patients 
who weigh  more than  30.0 kg . Usually the blood can be drawn from a vein in your arm at the 
same time as other blood collections.   The samples collected for future research purposes will be sent to the BMT CTN  Repository. 
The samples will be labeled with unique codes that do not contain information that could identify you. A link to this code does exist. The link is stored at the Data and  Coordinating Center for the 
Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network (BMT CTN  DCC ). The staff at the 
repository where your sample s are being stored does not have a link to this code. Your research 
samples will continue to be stored at the BMT C TN Repository until they are used up for 
research.  
 The reason for collection of these samples is to perform future studies to better understand how 
your immune system recovers after the transplant. This will help understand why patients develop complications  after transplant , including infections and graft -versus -host disease . 
 The research that may be done with your blood is not designed specifically to help you. It might 
help people who have cancer and other diseases in the future.  
 Reports about resear ch done with your blood will not be given to you or your doctor. These 
reports will not be put in your health record. The research will not have an effect on your care.  
 
Genome -Wide Association Studies : 
DNA from your stored blood samples might be used in genome -wide association (GWA) studies 
for a future project either done or supported by the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Genome -
wide association studies are a way for scientists to find genes that have a role in human disease or 
treatment. Each stud y can look at hundreds of thousands of genetic changes at the same time . 
 If your coded samples are used in such a study, the researcher is required to add your test results and sample information into a shared, public research database. This public database is called the NIH Genotype and Phenotype Database and it is managed by the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). The NCBI will never have any information that would

Version 4.0 dated June 22, 2017  
  
 
B-20 identify you, or link you to your i nformation or research samples , although the results of 
genetic studies could theoretically include identifying information about you.  
Things to Think About:  
The choice to let us have blood samples for future research is up to you. No matter what you 
decide to do, it will not affect y our care.  
 
If you decide now that your blood can be kept for future research, you can change your mind at any time.  Just contact your study doctor and let him or her know that you do not want us to use 
your blood sample. Then any blood that remains will n o longer be used for research.  
 In the future, people who do research on these blood samples may need to know more about your health.  While the study doctor or others involved in running this study may give the researchers 
reports about your health, it wi ll not give them your name, address, phone number, or any other 
information that will let the researchers know who you are.  
 Your blood will be used only for research and will not be sold. The research done with your blood 
may help to develop new products  in the future.  
  
Benefits:  
The benefits of research using blood include learning more about how your body’s immune system 
recovers after a transplant , as well as why certain complications like graft- versus -host disease or 
infections develop.  
 
Risks:  
There is a small risk of an infection or fainting from the blood draw.  
 
The greatest risk to you is the release of information from your health records. We will do our 
best to make sure that your personal information will be kept private. The chance that thi s 
information will be given to someone else is very small.   
Making Your Choice:  
Please read each sentence below and think about your choice. After reading each sentence, 
please indicate your choice below.  If you have any questions, please talk to your doc tor or nurse, 
or call our research review board at ___________________.  
 No matter what you decide to do, it will not affect your care.

Protocol:   BMT CTN # 1301  
 
• Why am I here?  
 
We are inviting you to join our study because you will receive a stem cell transplant to treat your 
disease. A transplant uses blood- making cells from another person (donor) to replace your cells 
that are not healthy. A donor is the name for a person who gives some of their blood- making cells 
for a transplant.  
• Why are you doing the study?  
 
We are comparing three different ways (types) to do a transplant to learn if any of them are better. 
Sometimes the donor cells cause a problem called graft versus host disease (GVHD). GVHD happens when the donor cells attack your body. One way  to avoid this problem is to give 
medications, other ways include removing the donor cells that can attack your body before injecting them to you or killing them after they are injecting in you. These are the three types of transplant that are being compar ed in this study.  
 
• What will happen to me? 
 
If you participate in this study you will receive one of the transplant types which will be chosen 
by chance, like a flip of a coin.   Before your transplant, your will have check -ups with your doctors. Then, you will get a small 
tube put in your chest in the operating room (you will be asleep for this). The small tube makes it easier for you to get your medications. It will also make it easier and less painful for drawing blood for tests.   You will receive medi cines that will help the cells from your donor grow in your body. These 
medicines might make you feel sick. You might throw up, lose your hair, or get sores in your mouth.   After you are done taking the medicines, you will get cells from your donor. This is your transplant. Your donor can be your sister or brother (related to you) or someone you don’t know (unrelated to you). You new cells will come from your donor’s bone marrow. The cells will make new and healthy cells in your body.  
 
 CNI-Free GVHD Prophylaxis Protocol –  1301  
Version 4.0 dated June 22, 2017  
  
 
B-28 You will stay in the  hospital for several days before your transplant and for about 4 weeks after 
your transplant. After you go home, you will need to go back to see your doctor often.  
 
It is possible that your disease will come back after the transplant. If this happens, your doctor will find another way to treat you.  
  
• Will it Hurt?  
 
For your transplant, we will put a small tube in your chest. It might hurt a little and you might 
bleed a little. You will need blood drawings sometimes from your arm, which also might hurt a 
little. Your doctor and nurses will make sure you feel as little pain as possible.  
 
• Will the Study help me?  
 
We don’t know if the study will help you or not.  
 
• What if I have questions? 
 
You can ask any question that you have about the study. If you forget to ask a question and think 
of it later, you can call me [ insert office number ]. You can also ask your question the next time 
you see me.  
  
 
• Do I have to be in the study?  
 
 
Writing your name on this page means that you agree to be in the st udy and know what will happen to you. 
If you decide to quit the study, all you have to do is tell your doctor.  
 
You and your parent or guardian will get a copy of this form after you sign it.

   CNI-Free GVHD Protocol -  1301  
Version 4.0 dated June 22 , 201 7 
 
 
B-30 Related Donor Informed Consent to Participate in Research  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
This is an informed consent document for a research study that your family member is participating 
in. This document will inform you about the details of this study, which will involve manipulation 
of your donated cells before they are given to your family member.  
 Your fami ly member has a blood cancer and will be treated with a stem cell transplant under a 
research study.  The goal of this study is to compare 2 different combinations of treatment plans to 
a standard transplant procedure. The objective is to see whether one or  both of these treatment 
plans are better  at reducing the occurrence of chronic graft versus host disease (GVHD), a life-
threatening complication of transplant.  The treatment plan that your family member was 
randomized to requires manipulation of your cells through a device that removes certain types of 
cells that  can cause this complication.  
 This informed consent document will explain important information about the study. There is no additional requirement from you beyond the procedure of stem cell collection to which you have already agreed. The cells you donate will be manipulated using a cell selection system that is part of the research study. Therefore, you need to be informed about this process and consent that  your 
cells can be manipulated according to the procedures in the study.  It is important to know that: 
• You will not be paid to be in this study.  
• You, your medical insurance company, or the patient’s medical insurance company 
will pay for all medical bills for your treatment  and the cell manipulation procedure . 
  
Before you decide on consenting and signing this document, please read the information below. 
Feel free to ask questions to understand your rights. The consent process is voluntary and will not interfere with your donation and the recipient’s transplant.

4. Sponsors and Source of Funding or Other Material Support  
The National Institutes of Health (NIH), through the Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network (BMT CTN), are providing staff support and money for this research study. The BMT CTN and the NIH will make decisions about how to manage the study.  Miltenyi Biotec, 
a company that produces the  cell selection system used to process the stem cells before giving 
them to  patients, is also a contributor to this  study and they are providing supplies and money. 
This research study is also registered with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) which is overseeing the  investigational  device that is part of the cell selection system  that will be used 
to remove T c ells from your stem cell donation, called stem cell manipulation,  prior to 
transplantation.  
 5. What will be different for you as a donor of peripheral blood stem cells if you choose to 
participate in this study?  
Participation in this study by signing this document will not change any aspect of the stem cell donation that you have agreed to already. By signing this document, you acknowledge that your family member is participating in a research study and that you consent that the cells you donate can be manipulated in an investigational device.  
 
6. What is the purpose of this study?  
The purpose of this study is to compare two different combinations of treatment plans to  a 
standard transplant procedure in order to see whether one or  both of them are better at  reducing 
the occurrence and severity of chronic GVHD. The research portion of this study involves 
manipulation of your stem cell product by removing T -cells, which cause chronic GVHD.  
 
7. What will be done if you take part in this research study?  
By sig ning this document, you consent that , after your donation, your cells will be manipulated 
by removing certain cells that can cause chronic GVHD in the recipient. The manipulation is 
performed by the investigational device. The way that you donate stem cell s will not be changed 
with your participation in the study.  
 
T-Cell Depletion (CD34+ Selection)  
The blood cells collected from you as part of the donation process will have large numbers of 
T cells, along with other cells, including your blood stem cells. The process of removing these T cells is called T -cell depletion and there are several ways that this can be done. In this study, 
they are being removed through a process called negative selection. The device used to do this is called CliniMACS and is prod uced by Miltenyi Biotec. The procedure involves labeling the 
stem cells, also called CD34+ cells, with an antibody attached to a magnetic substance. The CliniMACS tubing set has columns that will bind only the CD34+ cells allowing all the other cells, incl uding the T cells, to pass through. After the selection is done, the stem cell product 
will have mainly CD34+ cells, or stem cells, and will be depleted of T cells. The CliniMACS device has been extensively used in transplantation and has been proven to be  safe. However, 
it remains an investigational device.  This means it is not yet approved by the FDA for routine 
use. The FDA has granted approval for the use of this device and the CD34 reagent in this study and the study investigators are required to tell the FDA all information related to what happen s 
with study participants. The CliniMACS CD34 Reagent System was approved as a 
   CNI-Free GVHD Protocol -  1301  
Version 4.0 dated June 22 , 201 7 
 
 
B-32 humanitarian device and authorized by U.S. Federal law for use in the treatment of patients with 
acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in fi rst complete remission. The effectiveness of the device for 
this use has not been demonstrated. 
 
8. Will you provide blood samples for research? 
You will not be asked to provide extra blood samples for this research study. 
 
9. What are the possible discomf orts and risks?  
T-cell Depletion: The process of manipulation occurs after your donation is completed. The 
amount of cells requested for collection from you is not larger than what is routinely requested for a transplant. However, the amount of cells donat ed need s to be above a certain number and 
some donors may need an extra day of donation in order to achieve this number of cells. Results 
from earlier studies using th e same cell manipulation procedures found that 36% of the time , 
only 1 collection was needed;  45% of the time , 2 collections were needed ; and 7% of the time , 
a third collection was needed.  
 
Breach of Confidentiality:  Medical records are considered confidential.  These records are kept 
in a secured area accessible to people involved in the conduct of the study. You will not be 
identified by name in any publication or presentation of the results of this study. All data entered 
into a computer will be coded. No data that may be linked to you will be entered on any network 
computer that could allow access to confidential information. The master list will be stored off -
line and available only to the principal investigator and his or her designee(s). Although we will 
make every effort possible to maintain confidentiality, ther e is however, a slight risk of loss of 
confidentiality.   
 
10. As with any treatment, there may be yet unknown and/or unexpected side effects from 
donating peripheral blood stem cells.  
Donating blood stem cells is routinely done and is not considered research.  Unanticipated side 
effects may occur that have not been previously reported. If you have any unusual symptoms, 
you should report them immediately to your doctor.  
 In an attempt to avoid side effects, your doctor will examine you and obtain labor atory test s 
(blood tests, chest x -ray, etc.) to determine the effects of the donation and alter the drug doses 
if necessary.  
 
11. What other alternatives are available if you do not want to be in this study?  
Your participation is voluntary and you may choose not to participate in this research study or 
withdraw your consent at any time. Your choice will not at any time affect the commitment of 
your health care providers to provide care to you or to your family member. There will be no 
penalty or loss of ben efits to which you or your family member are otherwise entitled.  
Alternatives to participating in this research include donating your blood stem cells to your family member for a transplant that is not part of this research study.  
 
12. What are the possible benefits to you?  
   CNI-Free GVHD Protocol -  1301  
Version 4.0 dated June 22 , 201 7 
 
 
B-33 You will not benefit directly from participating in this research.  You may receive indirect 
benefit from knowing that you may be helping your family member or other donors and patients 
in the future.  
 
13. What are the possible ben efits to others?  
You may be helping other patients get better treatment in the future.  
 
14. If you choose to take part in this study, will it cost you anything?  
Normally the insurance company of the patient covers the medical expenses associated with 
colle cting your blood stem cells  and the T -cell depletion procedure . This will be reviewed with 
the patient’s insurance company prior to collecting your stem cells. Neither you (the donor)  nor your insurance company will be charged for the T -cell depletion of the peripheral blood stem 
cell graft.  
 
15. Will you be paid for taking part in this research study? 
No. 
 16. How can you withdraw from this research study? 
If you change your mind after you have provided consent, you can still decline participation in 
the study  prior to the stem cell manipulation . Please contact the person who discussed this

This is a form for a research study.  This form is to help you decide if you want to participate in 
this study.  
 
Purpose of the Research Study  
Your brother or sister  has blood cancer and is being treated with a transplant of peripheral blood 
stem cells from a matched family member  donor  in a research study.   
 The goal of thi s study is to compare 2 different treatment plans to a standard transplant procedure. 
The objective is to see whether one or both of these treatment plans are better at reducing the rate of a serious complication called chronic graft versus host disease (G VHD).  The treatment plan that 
your brother or sister was assigned to requires putting your donated cells through a device that removes certain types of cells that cause this complication before the cells are transplanted to your brother or sister.  
 You ar e being asked to be in the study because you are a match for your brother or sister and can 
donate peripheral blood stem cells to them.  Your doctor or another person on the study team will 
explain to you what you must do if you are going to donate peripher al blood stem cells for your 
brother or sister.  The team will also follow you closely to see if you are having any side effects 
while donating peripheral blood stem cells on the study.  
 If you have any questions, ask your doctors and make sure you understa nd their answers. Your 
parents (or a guardian) are also asked for their permission for you to join this treatment study.  
 I agree to donate blood stem cells in this study.

OPTIONAL  FUTURE  RESEARCH : PROPOSED DETAILED IMMUNOLOGIC STUDIES  
 
Patients  consenting to the optional  future research will have samples collected for undefined future 
research, as well as immune reconstitution and proposed detailed immunological studies . Samples 
will be collected at Baseline (prior to the initiation of the conditioning regimen) and post -transplant 
at Days 35, 100, 180 and 365. These sam ples will be shipped for cryopreservation to the BMT 
CTN Repository  and processed for later analysis. The BMT CTN Repository  will process  samples 
according to standard operating procedures (SOPs) . Table 1 describes allocation of specimens for 
immunologic a nalysis.  
 
Patients who weigh more than 30.0  kg are eligible to provide optional research samples and will 
have 6 mL of whole blood collected at Baseline and 80 mL of whole blood collected at each post -
transplant time point.  
 
Proposed Experimental Approach  
Multi- parameter flow cytometric analysis of effector and regulatory T -cell subsets : The flow 
cytometric examination of effector and regulatory T cells will be conducted on blood samples on cryopreserved samples . Based on established SOPs  by the N MDP repository e ach sample will be 
aliquoted in multiple vials with a cell viability upon freeze thaw of >95%.  This “central” sample 
processing is expected to provide maximal viability and functionality of the cells. Shipment of specimens between NMDP reposito ry and institutions will occur in batches and will start in year 
2 of patient accrual . The proposed studies are designed to assess the impact of GVHD prophylaxis 
strategy on reconstitution of lymphocyte subsets, particularly balance of alloreactive effector and regulatory T cells  and the relationship between GVHD prophylaxis and thymus function. 
Lymphocyte subsets will be identified using the following panels: CD4 subsets: naïve, effector, effector memory and central memory subpopulations defined by CD4 CD45RA CCR7 CD38 HLA -DR markers; recent thymic emigrants identified by the CD4+ CD45RA+ CD31+ CD95 dim 
phenotype.
75, 76, 77, 78 CD8 subsets: naïve, effector, effector memory and central memory 
subpopulations defined by the CD8 CD45RA CCR7 CD38 HLA -DR markers;75, 79, 80 recent 
thymic emigrant identified by the CD8+CD45RA CD31+ CD95dim phenotype. B cell subsets: memory versus naïve B cell populations will be d elineated by their expression of CD27, IgM  and 
IgD.
81 NK cell subsets: (CD56  bright, CD16 neg and CD56 moderate, CD16+). The analysis of 
regulatory T cells will be performed using multi- color flow cytometry with a pre -determined panel 
of monoclonal antibodi es (mAbs) including but not limited to those specific for CD3, CD4, CD25 
(IL-2Rα), CD31 (PECAM1), CD45RA, CD127 (IL -7R), Ki -67 and intracellular Foxp3. This 
multi- color approach would allow phenotypic separation of  human CD4+Foxp3+ T cells into three 
distinct subpopulations as well as assessment of their proliferative status (perc entage of Ki -67 
positive cells) .82, 83 In addition, we will combine these stains with Bcl- 2, CD95, and Annexin V 
stains to assess the apoptotic susceptibilit y of donor  Tregs. In all analyses the frequency and total 
number of cells will be determined.

DERIVATION OF A SEQUENTIAL TEST STATISTIC FOR CENSORED 
EXPONENTIAL DATA 
 
 
Background – The Sequential Probability Ratio Test  
 
Let )(.,θf be the density function for random variable X. According to Neyman and Pearson, the 
most powerful test of o H θθ=:0  versus1 1: θθ= H  decides in favor of 1H or 0Hif αc Ln> or 
αc Ln< , respectively, where ∏=n
ii i n xf xf L );(/);(0 1 θ θ is the likelihood ratio, and αcis 
determined to have the size α. When the sample size is not fixed in advance, further improvement 
is possible by using Wald’ s Sequential Probability Ratio Test (SPRT).  The SPRT continues to 
sample as long as A LBn< <  for some constant A B <<1 , stops sampling and decides in favor of 
1Has soon as A Ln>, and stops sampling and decides in favor of 0Has soon as B Ln<. 
 The usual measures of performance of such a procedure are the error probabilities 
αand βof 
rejecting 0Hwhen 0θθ=, and of accepting 0Hwhen 1θθ=, respectively, and the expected sample 
size )( )|( NE NEj j≡θ . Wald and Wolfowitz showed that among all tests, sequential or not, for 
which α≤) reject (Pr0 0 H  and β≤) reject (Pr0 1 H , and for which )(NEj  are finite, j=0,1, the 
SPRT with error probabilities α and βminimizes )(0NE  and )(1NE . If, in  addition, the 
,...2,1xx  are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) with density function ),(θxf , with 
monotone likelihood ratio in )(xτ , then any SPRT for testing 0θagainst ) (0 1θ θ>  has non-
decreasing power function. 
 
For the SPRT with error probabilities αandβ, the SPRT boundaries are given approximately by 
αβ/) 1(−=A  and ) 1/(α β − =B . The operating characteristics of the SPRT are given by

 The formula

G-3 Derivation of the SPRT for Censored Exponential Survival Times  
 
Suppose that we wish to construct a sequential test for the composite null hypothesis that the rate of overall mortality at an early time point t is less than or equal to p
0 versus the alternative 
hypothesis that it is greater than or equal to p 0. Let us assume that the survival times, nT TT ,...,,2 1 , 
are i.i.d. with exponential density function Te Tfθθ θ−=),( . Although an exponential model may 
not fit well for overall mortality, it usually provides a reasonable model over a short time frame for modeling toxicity, so in all discussion below we assume that exponential survival times are 
censored at time point t. I n the exponential parameterization, a t -day survival rate of p
0 translates 
into a mean survival of µ 0=-t/ln(1 -p0) (rate parameter =0θ -ln(1-p0)/t). . 
 
The SPRT is derived with reference to a simple null and alternative hypothesis for the rate 
parameter, in this case, 0:o Hθθ= versus1 1: θθ= H  . The log- likelihood ratio for the exponential 
in the presence of censoring is 
1 0 1 0 10 log ( ; ) log ( , ) (log( ) log( )) ( )nn n

events.  The SPRT can be represented graphically when plotting the number of deaths (d) on the y 
axis against the total time on study ∑n
iiT on the x axis. The continuation region in terms of d is 
bounded by two parallel lines given by

with common slope 10 1 0( ) / (log log )θθ θ θ−− , and intercepts 10 log / (ln ln )A θθ−  and 
10 log / (ln ln )B θθ− , for the upper and lower bounds, respectively. For monitoring purposes, at an 
interim analysis calendar time point s, suppose that d(s) events have occurred and that the total 
time on study is ()n
i
iTs∑ .The cumulative number of events d(s) is plotted on the y axis against the 
total time on study, ()n
i
iTs∑ . When this graph crosses the upper boundary, the null hypothesis is 
rejected.  In practice, monitoring will be scheduled monthly after the start of enrollment to the 
study.   
 
A truncated version of the SPRT can be obtained by specifying a maximum sample size. We 
truncate the SPRT by declaring that if the test has failed to terminate after the maximum sample 
size, that the null hypothesis will be accepted.  Since the probability that the untruncated SPRT 
would reject the null at the maximum sample size is negligible, it makes little difference ho w the 
final boundary value is selected, and this rule is chosen for simplicity. The operating characteristics 
of this proposed truncated SPRT for censored exponential data can be estimated by simulation.

Analysis plan for HPV vaccine champion  trial 
 
The purpose of this cluster randomized  non-inferiority trial is to compare Champion Announcement 
Approach Training (AAT)  to Traditional AAT  on HPV vaccine initiation  among patients ages 9 -12. 
 
Hypotheses  
The primary hypothesis is that Champion AAT will be  non-inferior to Traditional AAT for increasing HPV 
vaccine initiati on. By engaging highly influential physicians, we anticipate that Champion AAT will be at 
least as effective as Traditional AAT for increasing HPV vaccine uptake.   
 
Design  & Power  
We will randomize 40 clinics within multiple healthcare systems to the two trial arms  (Champion vs 
Traditional AAT) . To maximize balance in trial arms, we block randomization by system in a 1:1 ratio.  
 
With 20 clinics per study arm, we will have ≥80% power to conclude non -inferiority of Champion vs 
Traditional AAT when Champion AAT increases HPV vaccine uptake ≥8% points over the secular trend. 
This calculation assumes: 1) a clinic -level ICC of .033 for change in HPV vaccine initiation, as observed in 
our pilot work; 2) a non -inferiority margin of .04; 3) 100 patients, ages 9 -12, per clinic on average; 4) a 
secular trend of 10% points; and 5) Traditional AAT effect of 5% points, as observed in our prior trial.35 
Achieving an effect size of ≥8% points with Champion AAT is feasible, given that we are modeling HPV 
vaccination amon g unvaccinated adolescents, whose uptake will be higher proportionally than the 
general population.  
 
The non -inferiority margin, delta, will be .04, which we have selected to detect any clinically meaningful 
difference between the effectiveness of our interventions.  To test for non -inferiority with a margin of 
.04, we will translate the lower and upper 95% confidence interval limits into predicted probability units 
and conclude that Champion AAT is inferior if the transformed upper confidence limit falls be low .04.   
 
Analy tic Plan  
Primary trial outcome: HPV vaccine initiation by 12 -month follow -up  
We will assess the vaccination status of adolescents who are HPV vaccine naïve at baseline, using 
routinely collected EHR data from our healthcare systems  and submitted to the Wisconsin Collaborative 
for Healthcare Quality .  
 
We will model HPV vaccine initiation  using a generalized estimating equation (GEE) for logistic 
outcomes. GEE models accommodate non -independence due to nesting of patients within clinics by 
adjusting standard error terms. The outcome of the model will be patient -level HPV vaccine initiation  at 
follow -up (0=no, 1=yes):  
𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙(𝑝𝑝(𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑥𝑥2𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖)
1−𝑝𝑝(𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑥𝑥2𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖))=𝑏𝑏0+𝑏𝑏1𝐶𝐶ℎ𝑣𝑣𝑎𝑎𝑝𝑝𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑙𝑙𝑖𝑖+𝑏𝑏2𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑎𝑎𝑖𝑖 
Trial arm will be the primary fixed effect as a two -level, categorical variable (Champion AAT vs. 
Traditional AAT). Since we will be block random izing on healthcare system, system membership will be 
added as a n n-level, categorical covariate  where n is the number of participating systems . Tests will be 
2-tailed with α=.05   Statistical analyses will be conducted in SAS 9.4 (Cary, NC) and R 4.2.2.  
 
Missing Data  
We will use all available data in computing the primary outcome of HPV vaccine initiation by 12 -month 
follow -up as per our intent -to-treat protocol. We will drop the clinic  if no data are available  (e.g., due to 
clinic closure).  
 
Adjustment for  covariates  
We do n ot plan to adjust for demographic or other baseline characteristics p er CONSORT  
recommendations ( Consort , 2010 ). 
 
Secondary trial outcome  
The s econdary  trail outcome is  HPV vaccination  series completion (2 doses) at 12 months, which we will 
evaluate in the same manner as the primary outcome.

patching for treatment of cerebrospinal fluid leaks in spontaneous intracranial  hypotension  
 
NCT ID: [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  
Version Date : 10/26/2017  
 
  
 
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS  (see Schema)  
Patient  Selection  
 Inclusion Criteria : Adult patients meeting International 
Classification of Headache Disorders 3rd Edition (ICHD -3) criteria for a 
diagnosis of SIH (Table 1) who h ave had a contrast -enhanced  brain MRI 
and a myelogram confirming the presence of a CSF leak will be recruited 
from the Duke Radiology spine intervention clinic  [25]. 
Exclusion Criteria : (a) recent (i.e., < 2 weeks ) blood patch , (b) 
contraindication or inability to undergo the procedure, (c) inability to 
provide informed consent, (d) expected inability to complete follow -up 
assessment, (e) a contraindication to receiving contrast material 
(precluding an epidurogram) , or (f) contraindication to receiving fibrin glue (i.e., allergy) . We aim to recruit 148 
patients over 2 years. This number is based on the historical number of patients with SIH and confirmed CSF 
leaks treated at Duke , our sample size determination ( see Statistics ), and previously published studies .  
 
CT Fluoroscopy -Guided Blood and Fibrin Glue Patching  
 We will employ a single -center, parallel, randomized, blinded, prospective design.  Enrolled patients will 
be assigned to one of two treatment arms using a block randomization scheme: CT fluoroscopy -guided blood 
and fibrin glue patching targeted to the site of CSF leak or a simulated procedure without patching material . 
Baseline data will be collected including : (a) symptom profile and duration,  (b) headache impact test (HIT-6), 
(c) EQ-5D (a measure of overall health status) , and (d) work productivity and activity impairment (WPAI) (see 
Outcome s). All procedures will be performed under CT fluoroscopy on the same scanner (see Resources ). The 
location of injection for patients in both arms will be targeted to the site of the CSF leak identified on prior 
imaging (e.g., CT or dynamic myelogram ). All procedures will be performed by a board -certified radiologist with 
a CAQ  in neuroradiology and at least six years of 
experience in CT fluoroscopy -guided spine 
injections.  
 Patient s in both arms  of the study  will be 
placed  supine on the CT gantry table.  Intravenous 
(IV) access will be obtained and sterile autologous 
blood will be acquired for the purposes of possible 
patching. A planning CT scan (120 kVp, automatic 
tube current modulation: 100 – 400 mA, 2.5 mm 
section thickness, gantry rotation time 0.5 seconds) 
will be obtained with z -axis li mited to the area of 
interest. Acquired images will be used to plan a 
needle trajectory and approach to the location of 
the CSF leak for targeted patching  using previously 
described techniques for CT fluoroscopy -guided 
epidural patching (e.g. a lateral approach trajectory 
to the neuroforaminal epidural space, an oblique 
interlaminar trajectory to the dorsal spinal canal 
epidural space, or an approach traversing the 
neuroforamen to reach the ventral epidural space ) 
[14, 26 -29]. The skin surface will then be marked, 
sterilized, draped, and anesthetized  with 2% 
lidocaine .  At this point, a computer generated 
randomized treatment assignment will be delivered 
to the treating physician in an opaque sealed 
envelope, which will determine if the patient is 
treated with targeted blood and fibrin glue patching 
versus the simulated procedure. Patients and 
outcome assessors will remained blinded to the 
treatment assignment throughout the study. The 
treating physicians are unable to be blinded, as

they will be aware of the type of patching material  used . The effectiveness of patient blinding will be assessed 
using the Bang Blinding Index prior to discharge on the day of the procedure  [30]. 
 
Targeted Patching of CSF Leaks with Blood and Fibrin Glue  (Experimental Arm)  
 For p atients randomized to targeted patching with blood and fibrin glue , a 22-gauge 3.5 or 5 inch 
Quincke tip spinal needle will be advanced under intermittent CT fluoroscopic -guidance to the epidural  space 
at the target location. On reaching the target, gentle aspiration will co nfirm absence of blood return. 
Approximately 0.2 mL of contrast material (iopamidol  200 mgI/mL ; Isovue -M 200, Bracco Diagnostics  Inc., 
Princeton, NJ ) will then be injected to assess needle tip position and potential future spread  of patching 
material . Intravascular injection will be excluded  using a “double -tap” technique  (i.e., 2 sets of CT fluoroscopic 
images: an initial image immediately after injection and a second image acquired 2 -3 seconds later to assess 
for contrast material washout) , as previously described  [31]. After visual confirmation of correct needle tip 
position,  a mixture of autologous blood (~1 mL) and fibrin glue (~1-3 mL) will be slowly injected. This process 
will be repeated for all planned needle placements. The number of needle placements and total volume of 
blood and fibrin glue will be at the discretion of the treating radi ologist, but will be based upon: (a) the exten t of 
spread of patching material, (b) mass effect on the thecal sac and neural structures, and (c) patient symptoms. 
On completion of the procedure, the patient will be observed for 2 hours in the radiology post-procedural unit. 
 
Simulated Patching Procedure (Control Arm)  
 Patients randomized to undergo the simulated patching procedure will have the same experience as 
the patient s in the experimental arm , as described above . This includes placement of an IV, acquisition of 
sterile blood for potential autologous patching  (which will be discarded rather than used) , a planning CT, all of 
the same needle placements  that would have been performed if the patient were randomized to the 
experimental arm , and contrast injection for the epidurogram.  However, instead of injection of blood and fibrin 
glue patching material  through the needles,  an equivalent volume of preservative free sterile saline will be 
injected (buffered intrathecal electrolyte/dextrose injection; Elliots B Solution, Lukare Medical, Scotch Plains, 
NJ). On completion of the procedure, the patient 
will be observed for 2 hours in the post -
procedural unit.  
 
Adverse Events   
 Patients will be screened for adverse 
events immediately after the procedure as well 
as via phone call at one week post-procedure. 
While all adverse events will be recorded, the following will be considered major adverse events: stroke, 
paralysis, or other permanent neurologic deficit; allergic  reaction; hospitalization or ED  visit. Minor adverse 
events will include,  but not be limited to: nausea and/or  vomiting, symptomatic hypertension, vaso vagal 
reaction, temporary weakness or sensory deficit, and urinary retention . 
 
Patient Outcome Measures and Crossover  
Headache Impact Test (HIT -6): A validated headache assessment tool with good internal consistency and test -
retest reliability that is  designed to provide a global measure of headache impact in six domains  [32]. Scores 
range from 36 (asymptomatic ) to 78 (severe headache ).  Score  ranges: 36 -49 (little or no headache impact ), 
50-55 (some impact ), 56-59 (substantial impact ), and >60 (severe impact ) [33, 34] . Prior studies have 
determined that the minimally important clinical difference between groups is 1.5 points for the HIT -6 [35]. 
EQ-5D: A standardized measure of health status that provide s a simple, generic measure of health for clinical 
appraisal [36].  It is well -validated for health status measurement [37] and for quality -of-life in headache [34]. 
Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) : A validated 7 -point Likert -type scale assessing a patient’s overall 
impression of im provement after intervention [38, 39] . 
Work Productivity and Activity Impairmen t (WPAI) : A validated instrument with good test -retest reliability used 
extensively in health research [40, 41]  that quantifies impairment in daily activities and work productivity [42].  
Crossover : Patients will be permitted to crossover to the other treatment arm two months after the procedure.  
 
Statistics  
Patient Outcome Analysis  

 
The change  in HIT -6 from a pre -procedural score of > 56 (substantial or severe impact on life) will be 
considered for each group at each time point . Primary Endpoint (HIT -6 at 1 month): We will apply a two-sample  
t test, or in the cases of low counts and non -parametric data a Wilcoxon Rank Sum test, to test the primary 
endpoint. Secondary Endpoint s: The same analysis will be employ ed for all secondary endpoints at each time 
point.  
Sample Size Determination  
Based on previous ly acquired prospective outcomes data (unpublished), we will conservatively 
estimate a positive response rate of 50% in our experimental arm  (see Preliminary Studies ). In a meta -analysis 
examining sham procedures , our group  found a maximum placebo response of 30%  (Gu AP, unpublished) . 
Therefore, t o obtain a power of 0.8 (alpha 0.05) to detect superiority of the blood and fibri n glue patching 
group, assuming  positive response rates of  50% for the patching  group and 30% for the control  group, we 
would need a total o f 148 patients ( 74 patients in each arm).   
Interim Data Analysis  
 An interim analysis will be performed of the first 74 patients by the biostatistician . All study participants 
and other personnel will remain blinded. Safety and efficacy will be evaluated using an O’Brien –Fleming  
stopping rule of p < 0.001 in order to evaluate for early evidence of treatment effi cacy [43]. 
Crossover,  Withdrawal, or Missing Data  
We will employ an intention -to-treat (ITT) analysis for this trial [44]. Patients that crossover between 
study arms, withdraw from the study, or for whom there is missing data will all be handled in the same manner : 
we will conservatively assume that no further benefit will be gained from the initial treatment . As such, the most 
recent available outcomes data will be extrapolated to all later time points for which no data are available.

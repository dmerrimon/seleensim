Description of 
Study Procedures: This is a prospective, observational study to evaluate the safety of 
COVID -19 vaccination in children and adolescents  receiving vaccine as 
part of standard of care .  Children and adolescents who have not 
received any previous COVID -19 vaccines will be enrolled with their first 
dose.  Children and adolescents who have completed their primary 
vaccine series will enroll with their age- appropriate booster dose based 
on current FDA indications and CDC recommendations.  
  
Injection- site (local) and systemic reaction data and unsolicited adverse 
events will be assessed on vaccination day and daily during the 7 days 
following each COVID -19 vaccination dose using either identical web-
based or paper  memory aids , depending on study participant  preference.  
 
At 3 sites, serum samples will be collected for  optional  assessment of 
antibody titers to COVID -19.  Each participant who opts in will have 
baseline (within 3 days of vaccination) serologies obtained. Serum 
samples will also be collected for immunogenicity  assessment s at 28 
(+7) days after dose  2 or a booster dose . 
 All participants will be followed for 181 days after the last study dose 2 or 
a booster dose for serious adverse events  (SAEs ) and adverse events of 
special interest (AESI) .

 1 BACKGROUND   
 
As of September 2022 , there have been more than 95 million cases of COVID- 19 
leading to more than one million  deaths in the United States  (1).  Although COVID -19 
infection is generally milder in children than adults, it does cause significant pediatric 
morbidity and mortality.  The American Academy of Pediatrics reports that 15 million 
children have been infected during the pandemic  (2), leading to nearly 9000 cases of 
multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS -C) and 1500 deaths. From this 
perspective, safe and effective pediatric COVID -19 vaccines are needed to curb the 
pandemic.  
  
In May 2021, the FDA issued an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for the Pfizer -
BioNTech (Pfizer) mRNA COVID -19 vaccine in children aged 12- 15.  In the Phase III 
trial leading to the EUA, 2,260 adolescents 12 -15 years old were randomized 1:1 to 
receive 2 doses of 30 ug of the BNT162b2 vaccine or placebo administered 3 weeks 
apart  (3) . Pain at the injection site was the most common local reaction, occurring in 
86% of vaccine recipients after dose 1, and was somewhat less common after dose 2 (79%). Fatigue (60%), headache (55%), and chills (28%) were the most common  
systemic events after dose 1. These wer e slig htly more common after dose 2 (f atigue 
(66%), headache (65%), and c hills (42%) .    
 
On October 29, 2021 the FDA issued an EUA for the Pfizer -BioNTech vaccine in 
children aged 5 -11 years old, administered as  2 doses of 10 ug  3 weeks apart. The main 
safety study randomized children 2:1 to BNT162b2 (N=1518) vaccine or placebo 
(N=750); children were followed for at least 2 months after dose 2 . In general , children 
had less severe systemic reactions than adolescents  and young adults following the 
age-appropriate dose.  The most common systemic reactogenicity events in children 
aged 5- 11 years after were fatigue ( 33.6-39.4%)  and headache (22.4 -28%).  In children 
aged 5- 11 years fever was infrequent after dose 1 ( 2.5%) and dose 2 ( 6.5% ).  There 
were no serious adverse events in the pediatric study that were considered related to the  
BNT162b2 study vaccine. No cases of myocarditis or anaphylaxis occurred in the study  
(4).   
 In June 2022 the FDA issued an EUA for the Moderna mRNA -1273 vaccine in children 
and adolescents .  In the published phase III adolescent clinical trial 2,732 adolescents 
12-17 were randomized 2:1 to receive 2 doses of 100 ug of the mRNA -1273 vaccine or 
placebo, 4 weeks apart  (5).  . Pain was the most common local reaction, occurring in 
94% of vaccine recipients after  dose 1 and 93% after dose 2. The most common 
systemic reactions after dose 1 included fatigue (48%), headac he (45%), myalgia and 
chills. Fatigue (68%) and headache (70%) were more common after dose 2.  
 Although these randomized controlled trials demonstrate the safety and immunogenicity 
of mRNA vaccines in children, there are several gaps in our current knowledge.   
 First, the initial clinical trials in adolescents excluded children with known history of 
COVID -19 infection.  Baseline antibody testing was ascertained in both trials.  
Approximately 4% of participants in the Pfizer trial and 6% in the Moder na trial were 
seropositive at baseline, suggesting a prior history of asymptomatic infection. There 
were no significant differences in reactogenicity between children who were seropositive and those who were not.  However, children with previous symptomati c infection may 
Pediatric COVID -19 Vaccination (Lead)  Version 4.0  
April 3, 2023  
9 
 have more robust reactogenicity , as has been seen in adults  (6).  The Pfizer 5 -11 year -
old trial did enroll children with prior COVID infections and found no significant 
differences in reactogenicity between children who did and did not have a prior history of 
infection ( 4). 
 Secondly , the published pediatric tr ials did not  include a diverse population. COVID -19 
infections, hospitalizations, and deaths disproportionately impact Black and Hispanic or 
Latinx populations  (7). However, only 5% of participants in the Pfizer adolescent trial and 
3% in the Moderna adolescent trial were B lack.  Similarly, only 12% of participants in 
each trial were of Hispanic or Latinx ethnicity.  The Pfizer 5- 11 year-old trial was slightly 
more d iverse; 6.5% of participants were Black or African American and 21% were of 
Hispanic ethnicity  (4). 
 
Finally, there are sparse data regarding reactogenicity of COVI D
 -19 vaccine when co-
administered with other recommended vaccines.  In all of the pediatric Phase III clinical 
trials  to date, receipt of any  vaccine within 7 days of enrollment was an exclusion 
criterion  (8). The c urrent CDC clinical considerations for COVID- 19 vaccine do allow for 
receipt of COVID -19 vaccines on the same day as other vaccines .  The guidance states 
that if multiple vaccines are administered at a single visit, each should  be administered 
at a different injection site.  (9). However , published data regarding the safety and 
reactogenicity of this approach are lacking.  
 In September 2022, the FDA amended the use of the Pfizer -BioNTech vaccine to 
authorize bivalent vaccine for individuals ≥ 12 year -old (10).   However, there are no 
clinical data regarding the safety and immunogenicity of the BA.4 and BA.5 variant vaccines currently available in the United States.  
 Herein, we propose a prospective observational safety study of children receiving COVID -19 vaccine per standard of care, including booster doses .  We hope to fill 
existing knowledge gaps concer ning the safety of COVID -19 vaccines in the pediatric 
population by including children who were excluded from the trials, such as adolescents 
with a prior history of COVID -19 and those receiving concomitant vaccines.  We also plan 
to make every effort to re cruit a racially and ethnically diverse pediatric population.

3 STUDY DESIGN 
3.1 Main study design  
 This study is a prospective, observational study to evaluate the safety of COVID -19 
vaccine in 320 children and adolescents 5 - < 16 years -old receiv ing the vaccine per 
standard of care. Childr en and adolescents who have not received any  previous  COVID -
19 vaccines will be enrolled with their first dose .  Children and adolescents who have 
completed their primary vaccine series will enroll with their age- appropriate booster dose 
based on current F DA indications  and CDC recommendations.  With Day 1 serving as 
the day of vaccination, participants will be followed through Day 7 (total 7 days) after 
each dose of COVID -19 vaccine for symptoms of reactogenicity as described in S ection 
5.1. Participants will also be followed for 7 days after each vaccination for unsolicited 
adverse events, through day 181 for SAEs, and through day 181 for adverse events of 
special interest.  
 
Demographic and medical history data will be collected and COVID -19 serostatus 
determined at baseline, and parent perceptions of COVID -19 vaccine will be assessed 
on Day 7 after each dose of vaccine.  Participant perceptions will also be collected on 
Day 7 in adolescents  aged ≥  12 years.  
 
3.2 Laboratory studies  
 
3.2.1 Serologic studies  
We will evaluate pre-serologic responses at three sites  using an opt -in strategy .  
Prevaccination blood samples will be analyzed qualitatively for COVID -19 (SARS- CoV-
2) antibody status (positive or negative) at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center 
in a CLIA -certified lab. Venous blood (approximately 5 mL of blood) will be collected 
from each participant in close proximity to the first vaccination (up to 3 days before or after vaccination).  Venous blood will also be collected approximately 28 days after the 
second dose of vaccine received and stored for COVID -19 vaccine immunogenicity 
studies.  
 
   
3.2.2 SARS -CoV-2 Antibody Assay 
For children and adolescents at participating sites, optional blood draws will occur on 
Day 1 (before vaccination) and 28 (+7) days after dose 2 or a booster dose to be stored 
for serum COVID -19 neutralization assays.  COVID -19 neutralizing antibody titers will be 
assessed for each variant tested.  Participants will not receive individual COVID -19 
antibody titer results; these are not routinely used in clinical practice.

 3.2.3 Future studies  
In addition to the specified analyses described thus far, there might be other tests or 
assays that have yet to be identified that might be important for interpreting our study 
findings  or of relevance to pediatric  health outcomes . Additional laboratory assays may 
test for antibodies against other bacteria or viruses, markers of inflammation, or used in research on the health of children and adolescents.  Specimens banked for use in other  
studies will be linked to information (including identifying information) that participants 
provided to the study .  Participants in the opt -in serology analyses must agree to 
potential future use of samples in order to be in the study.   Because it is unknown if 
future testing will be of any utility, results of future testing will not be provided.

5.2 Parent /LAR Permission Process (Informed Consent)  
The consent process will take place in research or clinic exam rooms behind closed 
doors to assure privacy of the prospective participant.  Study staff will be available to 
answer all parent/LAR and participant  questions before and after permission is obtained.  
Parent(s)/LAR(s)  will b e given as much time as needed to decide whether or not to  allow 
their child to participate.  We anticipate that the initial consent discussion, including 
presenting the information in the consent document and answering questions will take about 30 minutes .  Parent(s)/LAR(s) will have the opportunity to take the consent form 
home and discuss the document with other family members or friends.  During the 
consent process , it will be stressed that participation is voluntary and that parents /LARs  
can withdraw permission for their child to participate at any time.  Permission will not be obtained from parent(s)/LAR(s)  who do not read, who are blind, or who do not 
read/understand English or Spanish. Parent(s)/LAR(s) will be given a copy of the signed 
informed consent to take home with them.  The original copy of the consent will be kept in the study records and a third copy will be included in the child’s medical record  per 
local requirements . Eligibility will be assessed . Depending  on site IRB requirements , 
assent  may also be obtained from the child.
 
 
5.3 Demographic Information, Medical History, Immunization History  
The participant’s age, race/ethnicity, and medical history will be obtained by 
parent/guardian report at the time of enrollment. The participant’s medical  history , 
concomitant medications and vaccines taken within 2 weeks of enrollment will be 
obtained by review of the electronic health record (EHR) and will be reviewed and 
confirmed by the parent/guardian at the time of enrollment.   
 Vaccines received dur ing the study  period will be documented by the clinic or research 
staff who administered the vaccines.  Documentation will include: product brand, lot 
number, site and date/time of vaccine administered during study participation.  
 
Throughout the study , the medical record will be reviewed to assess and record the 
occurrence of any serious adverse events or adverse events of special interest that occurred during the period of study enrollment.  
 
5.3.1 Randomization  
This is an observational study with no rando mization.    
 
5.4 Data Collection

naive.  
5.4.1 Vaccine Supply, Storage, and Administration  
Vaccination is not a study procedure. 
 
5.4.2 Biospecimen  Collection & Handling  
At 3 participating sites  (excluding  Columbia ), blood specimens will be collected from 
children in the optional serologic analyses during study Visits 1 and 3 as detailed in 
Table 1 for primary series  as well as Visit 1 and Visit 2 for booster dose as detailed in 
Table 2. All blood samples will be collected into serum separator tubes, transported per 
site operational procedures and processed as follows:  
• Gently mix the tube by inverting 5 times.  Allow blood to clot at room temperature for 
at least 30 minutes.  
• Centrifuge tube within 8 hours of collection at 1100 to 1300 RCF(g) for 10 minutes.  
• Gently remove the vacutainer stopper avoiding serum contamination with red blood cells. Using a single -use pipette, transfer 0.5 mL aliquots of serum (top layer) into 
1.0mL or 1.8 mL cryovials.  
Pediatric COVID -19 Vaccination (Lead)  Version 4.0  
April 3, 2023  
21 
 • Attach the study -specific barcode labels to the cryovial aliquots.  Numbers should be 
placed lengthwise on the tube.  
• Freeze the cryovials at -2 0°C in the temperature- monitored research center freezer 
for future shipment.   
 
Serum aliquots will be stored at each of the parti cipating site’s accessioning units  until 
immunogenicity assessments are performed.  
 
5.5 Reactogenicity & Safety Assessment  
 
Frequency and occurrence of local and systemic reactogenicity  events will be assessed 
through post -vaccination Day 7 using a standa rd memory aid . At the time of study 
enrollment, participants will be given a thermometer and instructed on using the  memory 
aid to document oral temperatures and post -injection symptoms. Beginning on the 
evening following  the first  COVID -19 vaccination, LARs/participants will record the 
participants oral temperature using the study -supplied thermometer, the occurrence of 
solicited and unsolicited AEs, and concomitant medication use for the next 7 days (Day 
1 – 7 ). Similarly, following the second COVID -19 vaccination,  LARs/ participants will 
record the participant ’s oral temperature using the study -supplied thermometer, the 
occurrence of solicited and unsolicited AEs, and concomitant medication use for the next 
7 days . Temperature will be recorded at roughly the same time each day. If a 
temperature > 100°F (37.8 °C) is recorded, a second measurement will be taken. If more 
than one temperature is taken on the same day, the highest temperature should be 
recorded. Fever will  be defined as a measured temperature ≥ 100.4°F (38°C). 
Participants will be queried during Visits 1a and 2a on solicited injection site adverse 
events, which will be classified as mild, moderate, or severe as described in Table 4. 
Participants will also be queried during Visits 1a and 2a on common post -injection 
systemic symptoms as described in Table 5.  
Unsolicited adverse  events (AEs)  will be collected and reported for the 7 days following 
each vaccine.   Any reports of new rash within 7 days after each dose will prompt a call 
from the study team to ascertain severity and the likelihood of an allergic reaction.  
Concomitant medication use,  and concomitant vaccinations will be assessed through 29  
days after dose 2 or a booster dose. Serious adverse events (SAEs), adverse events of 
special inter est (AESIs)  and unscheduled medical care for COVID -19 illness  will be 
assessed at 29 days after dose  2 of COVID -19 vaccine or a booster dose and through 
the end of the study (181 days after dose 2).  
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical 
investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not 
necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. Participants (or their 
parents) will be encouraged to report any significant unsolicited adverse events in an open- ended question format, e.g. “How are you (or your child) doing? Are you (or your 
child) having any medical or clinical problems? If so, please tell me about them.”  
An adverse event of special interest (AESI) includes the fol lowing:  
• Allergic type reactions (including anaphylaxis, hives, or facial and limb swelling 
occurring within 7 days of a vaccination visit)  
• Myocarditis or pericarditis occurring during the study period 
• Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS -C) during the study period 
 
Pediatric COVID -19 Vaccination (Lead)  Version 4.0  
April 3, 2023  
22 
 A serious adverse event ( SAE) is defined as an AE that meets one of the following 
conditions:  
• Results  in death  during  the period of protocol -defined surve illance   
• Is life -threatening (defined as im mediate risk of death  at the time of the  event)  
• Requires  inpatient  hospitaliz ation or prolonged hospitalization during  the period of 
protocol -defined surveillance (other than routine hospital admission for an elective  
medical procedure or  surgery )  
• Results  in congenital  anom aly or birth d efect  
• Results  in a persi stent or significant disability/in capacity  
• Any other  important  medical  event  that may not result  in death,  be life threatening,  or 
require hospitalization,  may be considered  an SAE when, based upon appropriate 
medical  judgment, the  event  may jeopardize the subject  and may require  medical  or 
surgical  intervention to prevent  one of the  outcom es listed  above.  Examples  of such  
medical  events  include allergic bronchospasm  requiring  intensive treatment in an 
emergency  room  or at home, blood dyscrasias  or convulsions  that do not  result  in 
inpatient  hospitalization,  or the developm ent of drug dependency  or drug abuse.  
 
Unsolicited adverse events, AESIs and SAEs will be graded as described in Table 6. 
Participants who report severe solicited adverse events or express any concern about 
symptoms/unsolicited events will be encouraged to follow up with their primary care 
provider. Study staff will assist with coordination of referral appointments as necessary.  
Parent/LAR will be asked to agree  to the release of information to obtain and review 
medical records for any unscheduled medical appointment s, including clinic visits and 
telehealth visits,  through 29 days after the second dose.  Frequency and occurrence of 
serious AEs (SAEs) , AESIs and unscheduled medical care for COVID -19 illness will be 
assessed through 181 days after dose 2 or a booster dose.

In this study, COVID -19 vaccination is not a study procedure. COVID -19 vaccine 
administration will be given  per standard of care to children and adolescents receiving 
vaccine under an EUA by the Food and D rug Administration . Published studies  in 
children and adolescents found no vaccine- related serious adverse events in children or 
adolescents receiving  BNT162b2 ( 3-5).  Lymphadenopathy was identified as an adverse 
event occurring more frequently in BNT162b2 vs. placebo groups during clinical trials  
(11). Post-authorization vaccine safety data have identified two safety concerns that 
rarely can occur after vaccination: severe allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis , and 
myocarditis and pericarditis  (11). Therefore, we do not anticipate any significant issue 
with serious adverse events (SAEs) .  Nevertheless,  we will monitor study participants for 
SAEs during the protocol -defined surveillance period of 6 months after sec ond dose or a 
booster dose. SAEs will be reported to the CDC and all participating IRBs according to 
institutional requirements.

 Perceptions of COVID -19 vaccine 
At Day 7 (+ 3) following each of the vaccination visits we will assess adolescent ( ages 12 
to < 16) and parent /LAR  perceptions of the COVID -19 vaccine recommendations and 
experience with receipt of the vaccine. Questions are provided in Tables 7 and 8 below. 
We will use a Likert scale (strongly agree, agree, neither, disagree, strongly disagree) to  
assess response to the questions about concerns  regarding  COVID -19 vaccine safety.  
As noted, adolescent  and parent perceptions regarding vaccine receipt will be assessed 
at the reactogenicity assessment visits after each vaccine.

Causality (relatedness) Assessment   
Study site investigators will assess relatedness to COVID -19 vaccine or study 
procedures (related, possibly related, unlikely related, or not related) for SAEs and 
AESI s. Solicited symptoms in Tables 4 and 5 will all be considered to be related to 
COVID -19 vaccine and causality assessment will not be done for these events. The 
study investigators will use their clinical judgement to make causality assessments and may consult the Safety Review Panel or CISA Project for assistance with causality 
determinations. The final causality assessment decision is the responsibility of the site PI where the subject was enrolled.  
  
Reporting Adverse Events  
SAEs and unanticipated problems will be reported to the CDC and all participating IRBs according to institutional requirements. Vaccination is not a study procedure.  
 Adverse events that occur in a recipient following COVID -19 vaccination should be 
reported to CDC’s Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). Vaccination providers are required by the Food and Drug Administration to report the following that 
occur after COVID -19 vaccination under Emergency Use Authorization:  
• Vaccine administration errors  
• Serious adverse events  
• Cases of Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome  
• Cases of COVID -19 that result in hospitaliz ation or death  
Reporting is encouraged for any other clinically significant adverse event even if it is uncertain whether the vaccine caused the event. Information on how to submit a report 
to VAERS is available at  https://vaers.hhs.gov   o

 6  LABORATORY ANALYSES  
Serum samples will be analyzed by the use of a qualitative  enzyme- linked 
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) which measures IgG antibody to the SARS -CoV-2 Spike 
protein. Recombinant full length Spike protein is used to coat ELISA plates and serum 
samples that have an Optical Density (OD) value above the established cut off are 
considered positive for antibody. The assay was qualified for use in the Laboratory for 
Specialized Clinical Services at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC), a laboratory that is certified by the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) 
and College of American Pathologist (CAP) under US FDA Emergency Use 
Authorization.  
 
Q
ualitative serologic testing will be completed in periodic batches throughout the course 
of the study and will therefore not be available in real -time or for use in clinical decision-
making. CCHMC will share participant results with submitting study site s as permitted by 
CDC.  Study sites may share results with participants as permitted by FDA, CDC, and 
local site regulations.  
 
6.1 COVID -19 Immunogenicity  
 
The Duke NAb Laboratory for HIV and SA RS-CoV-2 Vaccine Research and 
Development (Duke NAb Lab, PI: David Montefiori) will assess the magnitude, kinetics and duration of neutralizing antibody responses against SARS -CoV-2 by using a 
validated assay in an environment that operates in compliance w ith Good Clinical 
Laboratory Practices (GCLP).  
 
Neutralization of SARS- CoV-2 Spike -pseudotyped viruses will be assessed in 
293T/ACE2 cells as described in SOP “CFAR02- A0026 Measuring Neutralizing 
Antibodies Against SARS- CoV-2 Using Pseudotyped Virus and 293T/ACE2 Cells.” This 
assay has been formally validated and is part of Drug Master File # 26862 with the US 
Federal Drug Administration. Assay validation was performed with human serum 
samples and monoclonal antibodies using the D614G form of the Wuhan -1 Spike, which 
is the dominant form of Spike protein in the global epidemic. This assay has also been validated using B.1.351(246R) and B.1.1.529 (BA1) and may be validated for other 
newly emerged variants as needed.  
 Neutralization is measured by using lentiviral particles pseudotyped with SARS- CoV-2 
Spike and containing a firefly luciferase (Luc) reporter gene for quantitative 
measurements of infection by relative luminescence units (RLU). SARS -CoV-2 Spike -
pseudotyped viruses are prepared and titrated for infectivity by using mutated forms of an expression plasmid encoding codon- optimized full -length Spike of the Wuhan -1 strain 
(VRC7480) provided by Drs. Barney Graham and Kizzmekia Corbett at the Vaccine 
Research Center, National Institutes of Health (USA). Mutations were introduced into 
VRC7480 by site- directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange Lightning Site- Directed 
Mutagenesis Kit from Agilent Technologies. All mutations were confirmed by full -length 
Spike gene sequencing. Pseudovirions are produced in HEK  293T/17 cells by 
transfection using Fugene 6 Transfection Reagent and a combination of Spike plasmid, 
lentiviral backbone plasmid (pCMV ΔR8.2) and firefly Luc reporter gene plasmid (pHR' 
CMV Luc) in a 1:17:17 ratio in Opti -MEM (Life Technologies). Pseudovirions are titrated

 for infectious dose (TCID50) by making serial 3 -fold or 5 -fold dilutions in quadruplicate 
for a total of 11 dilutions in 96- well flat -bottom plates.  
 
A pre -titrated dose of virus is incubated with 8 serial 5- fold dilutions of serum samples in 
duplicate in a total volume of 150 µl for 1 hr at 37°C in 96- well flat -bottom culture plates. 
Cells are detached using TrypLE Select Enzyme solution, suspended in growth medium (100,000 cells/ml) and immediately added to all wells (10,000 cells in 100 µL of growth 
medium per well). One set of 8 wells receives cells + virus (virus control) and another set 
of 8 wells receives cells only (background control). After 71 -73 hrs of incubation, medium 
is removed by gentle aspiration and 30 µl of Promega 1X lysis buffer is added to all wells. After a 10 minute incubation at room temperature, 100 µl of Bright -Glo luciferase 
reagent is added to all wells. After 1 -2 minutes, 110 µl of the cell lysate is transferred to 
a black/white plate. Luminescence is measured using a GloMax Navigator luminometer 
(Promega). Neutralization titers are the serum dilution at which RLUs are reduced by 
either 50% (ID50) or 80% (ID80) compared to virus control wells after subtraction of 
background RLUs. Serum samples are heat -inactiva ted for 30 minutes at 56°C prior to 
assay.  
 For assay internal quality controls (IQC), a qualified positive control is tested on each 
assay plate (plate control). Assay run controls may consist of COVID- 19 convalescent 
serum samples or SARS -CoV-2 vaccine recipients with high, medium and low ID50 and 
ID80 titers against the test virus, plus a normal human serum negative control. Levey -
Jennings plots will be generated during testing and checked for violations of standards 
that are based on the Westgard Rules.  Violations of the Westgard Rules are investigated 
in real -time. 
 
7 STATISTICAL CONSIDER ATIONS   
In collaboration with the Cincinnati, Columbia, and Kaiser  teams , the research team at 
Duke will oversee the statistical analysis. Data will reside on a secure Duke server maintained by Duke Health Technology Solutions (DHTS). For the study, a database will be developed and a data set for the study without personal identifiers will be made 
available to the CDC upon request.  Duke statisticians will develop a compr ehensive 
Statistical Analysis Plan.  The summary points of the analysis plan are presented below.  
 
7.1 Sample Size and Power Estimation  
Because this is an observational study with no randomization of subjects into treatment 
groups, there will be no formal statistical power or sample size calculation 
 
7.2 Analysis Plan  
 
7.2.1  Analysis Populations 
There will be one study population named the Study Cohort. The Study Cohort includes 
any participant that was enrolled and received at least one dose of a COVID -19 vaccine.

reactogenicity  event  by maximum  classification (none,  mild,  moderate,  and severe),  as 
well as by moderate or severe  through  days  1-7 following  COVID -19 vaccination for 
dose 1 and dose  2 or a booster  dose. These  tables  will have the number  and percentage 
for each classification  and will be broken  down by each site and across all sites. In 
addition,  the number  and percentage of participants  with at least  one moderate -to-
severe local or systemic reactogenicity  event  will be described,  as well as the proportion 
of participants  with at least  one severe local or systemic reactogenicity  event .  (POM  1, 
POM  2 and POM  3)  
 
2) Tables will be produced that summarize each unsolicited adverse event by maximum 
classification (none, mild, moderate, and severe), as well as by moder ate or severe 
through days 1- 7 following COVID -19 vaccination for dose 1 and dose 2  or a booster 
dose. These tables will have the number and percentage for each classification and will 
be broken down by each site and across all sites  (POM4) . 
 3) Tables will be produced that summarize participants experiencing at least one serious 
adverse event or one AESI through the 29 days after dose 2 or a booster dose. This 
table will have the number and percentage for each outcome. Listings with the clinical narratives  will also be provided.  (POM5 and POM6) 
 
 
7.2.3  Secondary  Objective  
  
Secondary  Objective  - To assess the safety  of simultaneous  administration of COVID -19 
vaccine with other  routinely  recommended  vaccines  among children and adolescent  
participants.   
 
1) Tables  will be produced that summarize  each solicited  local and systemic 
reactogenicity  event  by maximum  classification (none,  mild,  moderate,  and severe),  as 
well as by moderate or severe  through  days  1-7 following  COVID -19 vaccination for 
dose 1 and dose  2 or a booster  dose. These  tables  will have the number  and percentage 
for each classification and will be broken  down by concomitant  childhood vaccine status  
(yes/no)  by each  site and across  all sites. (SOM  1, SOM  2 and SOM  3) 
 
2) Tables will be produced that summarize each unsolicited adverse event by maximum 
classification (none, mild, moderate, and severe), as well as by moderate or severe 
through days 1- 7 following COVID -19 vaccination for dose 1 and dose 2  or a booster 
dose. These tables will have the number and percentage for each classification and will 
be broken down by concomitant  childhood vaccine status  (yes/no)  by each site and 
across  all sites. (SOM  4)

Analysis  Plan.   .    
 
7.
2.5 Safety Monitoring Plan  
An interim safety data review of all SAEs will be performed with the goal of identifying 
unexpected safety concerns of clinical importance. The interim safety data review will be 
performed by a panel with relevant expertise who are not investigators on the study. The 
safety review panel will assess the clinical narratives of SAEs and AESIs for all 
participants who were vaccinated. Additional data reviews will be generated if the CDC 
and study investigators determine they are needed. There are no statistical analyses 
planned for this safety data review.  
 
7.3 Data  Management  Plan   
The novel Vanderbilt -designed resource developed specifically for online collection of 
research information, the Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) platform 
(https://projectredcap.org/ ), will be used to design study forms, including the reaction 
forms, and short customized questionnaires to collect information from study subjects. REDCap provides: 1) a streamlined process for rapidly building a database; 2) an intuitive interface for collecting data, with data validation and audit trail; 3) automated 
export procedures f or seamless data downloads to common statistical packages; 4) 
branching logic, file uploading, and calculated fields; and 5) a quick and easy protocol set-up. This system will be used by Duke for data management.  All electronic linkages 
will fulfill regulations for protection of human subjects and requirements to minimize the 
risk of breach of confidentiality.  
 
A
ll study -related documents containing protected health information, (e.g., enrollment 
logs, case report forms,  memory aids, and perception survey s) completed by study 
participants, will be maintained in secure research offices at Duke , Cincinnati, Columbia 
and Kaiser , which are accessible to research staff only.  
 The study team will utilize a secure, encrypted, file transfer method for sharing study 
documents and data with the CDC.   No personal identifiers will be included in any 
shared documents or datasets.    
 
7.3.1 Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap)  
REDCap ( h ttp://project- redcap.org/ ) assists with the collection and management of data 
for diverse clinical and translational research studies. REDCap was designed around the 
concept of giving research teams an easy method to specify project needs and rapidly 
develop secure, web- based applications for collection, management and sharing of 
research data. REDCap accomplishes these key functions through use of a single study 
Pediatric COVID -19 Vaccination (Lead)  Version 4.0  
April 3, 2023  
30 
 metadata table referenced by presentation- level operational modules. Based on this 
abstracted programming model, databases are developed in an efficient manner with 
little res ource investment beyond the creation of a single data dictionary. The concept of 
metadata- driven application development is well established, and the critical factor for 
successful data collection lies in creating a simple workflow methodology allowing 
research teams to autonomously develop study -related metadata in an efficient manner. 
Both products include secure institutional data hosting and include full audit -trails in 
compliance with Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) security  
requirements. The REDCap Consortium is comprised of 647 active institutions. The 
REDCap currently supports 68,000 projects with over 89,000 users spanning numerous 
research focus areas across the consortium.  The current project will use this software application for the design of electronic forms to collect information from study 
participants, to link the baseline data, sample collection date, and laboratory results in an 
automated database family, to perform data cleaning and data quality assurance 
efficiently, and to design an analytical dataset for the analysis of the project data.  
 
Data will be entered into the REDCap database by members of the study team from Duke , Cincinnati, Columbia, and Kaiser, using the paper case report forms utilized to 
record  data collected as part of study procedures. Study investigators will be responsible 
for assuring that all paper records are securely stored according to the requirements of their IRBs. The study investigators will be responsible for assuring the accuracy of the 
data entered from the paper forms into REDCap.   
 
In order to perform data cleaning and data quality assurance efficiently, numerous built -
in filters and checks for consistency of the data including range and limit checks, 
branching logic and pull down menus to limit choices for categorical variables to a pre -
specified list will be implemented and performed automatically to minimize data entry error. The data will be randomly sampled and checked against source records on a 
regular basis. The data and related analytical datasets will also be stored at the lead and 
contributing sites with secured password- protected computers.  
 
7.3.2 Role  of the CDC Investigators in the Project  
This study is funded by a CDC contract with Duke University , Cincinnati Children’s 
Hospital, Columbia University, and Kaiser Permanente as Task Orders in the CISA Project Contract.  The Duke University PI (will oversee the study in partnership with the 
Cincinnati Children’s Hospital  PI, the Columbia University PI and the Kaiser Permanente 
PI).  CDC staff will collaborate with all sites to develop the protocol, conduct the study, 
ensure the study is aligned with US Department of Health and Human Services (CDC) 
public health priorities, and analyze the data and disseminate the result s. CDC may 
receive access to coded data not containing any directly identifying information.  
 
8 HUMAN SUBJECTS  
8.1 Human Participants Involvement, Characteristics, and Design   
Duke, Cincinnati, Columbia, and Kaiser investigators will be responsible for submitting 
the protocol, informed consent , memory aids , recruitment materials and any written or 
verbally conveyed materials  specific to this project to their institutional review boards.   
The CDC, as the funding agency, supports an exception to the sIRB mandate for the participating sites under the provision at 114(b)(2)(ii).  CDC staff will be responsible for 
submitting materials to the CDC for review and obtain reliance on Duke IRB .   
Pediatric COVID -19 Vaccination (Lead)  Version 4.0

To facilitate participant recruitment at the practices, we will request a waiver of consent 
and HIPAA authorization as per institutional requirements for ascertainment 
(identification, selection) and/or recruitment of potential participants while recording 
identifiable private health information (PHI) prior to obtaining the participant’s consent.  
This information will be obtained from review of the electronic scheduling and medical record systems in the clinics in order to determine eligibility for study enrollment. T he 
PHI collected prior to consent will be used to recruit and screen only. Use of PHI in this manner involves no more than minimal risk to participants and no information will leave 
the study sites. Informed consent will be sought in accordance with 45 CFR 46.116, prior 
to enrollment.  
 
Continuing reviews will be su bmitted to the IRBs in accordance with the new Common 
Rule.  Protocol deviations or concerns about study integrity will be reported promptly to 
the overseeing IRB in accordance with institutional requirements. 
 
8.2 Sources of Material  
Medical history and immunization history will be obtained from the medical record and 
from parent and patient report.  Demographic information will be obtained from the 
medical record and  parent /LAR  and patient report.  Participants will record solicited 
adverse reactogenicity events and any medical intervention sought on the day of and 7 days following both vaccinations on the  memory aid . Memory aid captured information 
will be reported to the study team during a telephone call or in the web- based REDCap 
system. Information about SAEs and AESI s will be obtained through medical record 
review and visits.  
 
8.3 Potential Risks and Benefits  
Risks of blood drawing include pain, swelling, bleeding, or bruising at the site where the 
blood sample is collected. Subjects may also experience dizziness or fainting.  
 
8.4 Adequacy of Protection  
Every effort possible will be made to keep information about participants confidential. 
Computerized participant information will be kept in password protected files on secured servers.  Paper case report forms will be kept in locked files belonging to the study 
personnel.  Any publications resulting from this work will not contain any identifiable 
participant information.  
 
8.4.1  ClinicalTrials.gov Requirements  
This observational study is not required to be registered on ClinicalTrials.gov by 
r
egulation.  However, as requested by CDC, the study is registered on ClinicalTrials.gov 
(NCT [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ). It is the responsibility of the lead site for creating, maintaining, 
and uploading pertinent information regarding the study to ClinicalTrials.gov.

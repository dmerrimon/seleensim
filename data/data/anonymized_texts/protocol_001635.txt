 The START -CKD study is designed to describe the benefits and potential risks of a ne w 
treatment strategy using a fixed dose of darbepoetin alfa in subjects with chronic kidney disease 
and not on dialysis  (ND- CKD) .  Subjects will be randomly allocated to treatment with a fixed dose 
of darbepoetin alfa or to treatment with darbepoetin alfa using a hemoglobin ( Hb)-based titration 
strategy, which has been the conventional dosing strategy.   This study  aims  to estimate t he 
incidence of red blood cell ( RBC ) transfusions  (administered as deemed clinically necessary)  in 
each group and the differenc e in incidence of RBC transfusions between the 2 groups .  In 
addition, m ultiple aspect s, such as cumulative darbepoetin alfa dose, total number of units of 
transfusions, Hb concentration, Hb- related parameters (eg, Hb variability, excursions, rate of 
change), and adverse (eg, cardiovascular ) events , will also be considered in order to determine a 
preferred dosing regimen. 
Protocol Synopsis  
Title:   START -CKD: Strategies Using Darbepoetin alfa to Avoid Transfusions in Chronic Kidney 
Disease  
Study Phase:   3 
Indication:  Management of anemia in chronic kidney disease patients not on dialysis.  
Primary Objective:   To evaluate the incidence of RBC transfusions in ND -CKD  subjects  using 
either a Hb- based titration algorithm or a weight -based dose that will not be tit rated (fixed dose), 
and to evaluate the difference in the incidence of RBC transfusions between the 2 groups.    
Secondary Objective(s)  
To summariz e the following for each dosing strategy:  
• Transfusion burden  
• Time to first RBC transfusion 
• Achieved Hb concen tration  
• Cumulative dose of darbepoetin alfa 
To describe the difference in each of the above between the two dosing strategies.  
Safety Objective:  To describe the safety profile of darbepoetin alfa, including adverse events 
and the occurrence of adjudicated clinical events of interest . 
Exploratory Objectiv e(s) 
To describe with each dosing strategy:  
• Dose and Hb- related parameters  
• Initial Hb response and resulting dose and achieved Hb 
• Duration of hospitalization  
• Allosensitization over time  
Hypotheses:   The incidence of RBC transfusions in each treatment group (Hb- based titration 
group and fixed dose group) and their difference will be estimated, and no formal hypothesis will 
be tested.  The width of the 95% confidence interval (CI) of the transfusion incidence rate is 
expected to be < 10% (ie, ± 5% around the point estimate) in each group and the width of the 
95% CI of the difference in transfusion incidence rates is expected to be < 14% (ie , ± 7% around 
the point estimate).   The efficacy and safety  of each treatment group will  be described, as these 
aspects will assist in the determination of a preferred dosing regimen.

 Study Design:  This is a phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double- blind, parallel group study.  
Anemic, ND -CKD subjects, without recent ESA use,  will be randomized to 1 of 2 dosing 
strategies .  In the Hb- based titration group, darbepoetin alfa doses will be titrated to maintain 
Hb ≥ 10.0 g/dL.  In the other group, subjects will receive a fixed dose of darbepoetin alfa.  All 
subjects will receive investigational product (IP) as a subcutaneous injection every 4 weeks 
(Q4W).  Treatment group, darbepoetin alfa doses, and protocol specified Hb concentrations will 
be blinded to the investigator, subjects and study team.  Subjects will be followed for 
approximately 2 years from the date of randomization.  
Sample Size:   A total of approximately 750 subjects (approximately 375 per treatment group)  will 
be randomized. 
Summary of Subject Eligibility Criteria    
Anemic ND-CKD  subjects:  
• Age 18 or older  
• Two Hb concentrations < 10.0 g/dL at least 2 week s apart   
• Not currently receiving dialysis with an e stimated  glomerular filtration rate of 
< 45.0 mL/min/1.73m2 during screening  
• Iron replete, defined as a transferrin saturation (TSAT) ≥ 20% and a ferr itin ≥ 100 ng/mL  
• Clinically stable by the investigator  
Who have not:  
• Received erythropoiesis stimulating agents ( ESAs) within 4 weeks of screening  
• Received  an RBC transfusion within 8 weeks of screening  
• Received intravenous  iron or had changes to oral iron therapy within 4 weeks of scr eening  
For a full list of eligibility criteria, please refer to Section  4. 
Amgen Investigational Product Dosage and Administration  
Investigational product (darbepoetin alfa or placebo) will be administered subcutaneously every 
4 weeks.  Darbepoetin alfa will be supplied as a clear, colorless, sterile protein solution in singl e 
use prefilled syringes (PFS) at concentrations of 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 80, 100, 150, 200 and 
300 µg.  Placebo will be provided in similar PFS as a clear , colorless , sterile  solution.  
The protocol specified doses (PSD) for use in this study are 10, 20,  30, 40, 50, 60, 80, 100, 120, 
150, 200, 250, and 300 µg.   
Every 4 weeks a protocol specified Hb will be measured using a n modified  Hb point of care 
(POC)  devic e and the results will be blinded.  The codes  provided by the modified  Hb POC  
device and the mean systolic blood pressure (SBP) will be entered into the interactive voice 
response/interactive web response ( IVR/IWR ) system at each dosing visit. The mean SBP 
obtained from additional blood pressure monitoring visits will also be entered into the IVR/IW R 
system.  
In both dosing groups, the dose of investigational product will be withheld if the subject’s mean 
SBP is ≥ 160 mmHg for three consecutive visits  (including blood pressure monitoring visits) .  
Investigational product will be restarted at the dosing visit when the mean SBP is ≤ 140 mmHg.  
Subjects randomized to the Hb- based titration group will receive an initial dose of 
darbepoetin alfa of 0.45 µg/kg, based on the subject’s screening weight, rounded down to the 
next lower PFS strength.  Subsequently, the dose of darbepoetin alfa will be titrated based on the Hb concentration at the current visit and rate of rise (ROR) as outlined in the table below.  The Hb 
ROR will be determined by the protocol specified Hb concentrations obtained from the previous 
dose to the current dose.  An IVR/IWR system will be used to determine and assign each dose.  
Subjects may be assign ed 2 injections to ensure they receive the dose assigned for that visit.

b Subjects receiving 10 µg who require a dose reduction will receive placebo  
c Restart darbepoetin alfa when Hb < 10.0 g/dL, at next lower PSD  
Subjects randomized to the fixed dose group will receive a fixed dose of darbepoetin alfa 
throughout the study of 0.45 µg/kg, based on the subject’s screening weight, rounded down to the 
next lower PFS strength.  The same dose of darbepoetin alfa will then be administered Q4W for 
the duration of the study, with 1 exception: if the Hb is > 12.0 g/dL, the darbepoetin alfa dose will 
be withheld and placebo will be administered until the Hb falls below 10.0 g/dL, at which time the darbepoetin alfa dose will be restarted.   In order to maintain the blind when a subject in the 
Hb-based titration group is assigned 2 injections of investigational product , subjects in the fixed 
dose group will be assigned at random to receive 2 injections of investigational product .  
Throughout the study, investigators should provide adequate supportive care.  It is recommended 
that iron be administered to ensure TSAT l evels of ≥ 20% and serum ferritin ≥ 100 ng/mL and 
blood pressure be monitored and managed as appropriate, such as to target a SBP <  130 mmHg 
and a diastolic blood pressure ( DBP) < 80 mmHg.  Subjects should not receive any other ESAs 
while receiving investigational product during the study.  
Procedures    
Informed consent will be obtained prior to the execution of any study procedures.  Subject visits and assessments will occur from the time of screening through the end of study.  At the 
conclusion of  the scre ening period, eligible subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to 1 of 
2 dosing strategies:  
• Hb-based titration group:  Darbepoetin alfa titrated to maintain Hb ≥ 10.0 g/dL  
• Fixed dose group:  Weight -based dose of darbepoetin alfa that will not be titrated  
Randomization will be stratified by RBC transfusion received within 12 months prior to random ization (yes/no) and site practice setting (nephrology/non- nephrology).  
Assessment s during the study visits may include:  
• Recording of transfusions, adverse events, concomitant medications, hospitalizations  and 
collection of study endpoint data for adjudic ation 
• Physical assessments (eg, blood pressure)  
• Collection of laboratory samples for evaluation of blood chemistry, hematology and iron 
status  
• Collection of blood samples for biomarker s 
Subject s ending investigational product prior to week 97 will be asked to complet
 e 
scheduled visits and study procedures.  At a minimum, subjects must be followed for the collection of RBC transfusions and endpoint data for adjudication.  
 
RBC 
transfusions should be performed as deemed necessary by the treating physician and 
criteria are not stipulated by this study protocol.  Information regarding the context surrounding RBC transfusions will be collected throughout the study including units of RBCs transfused, the 
transfusion setting (eg, dialysis center, intensive care unit, emergency department)  and clinical

 events (eg, bleeding, surgery).  This information will be reviewed by an independent Clinical 
Endpoint Committee (CEC).  
Events of death,  myocardial infarction, stroke, decompensated heart failure and 
thromboembolism, including vascular access thrombosis,  will also be collected from 
randomization through the end of the study and adjudi cated in a blinded fashion by the 
independent CEC .  
Adverse events (AEs) will be collected from the time of randomization through 4 weeks f ollowing 
the last dose of investigational product.  Serious adverse events will be collected from the date of consent.  Any serious adverse events with a fatal outcome (regardless of possible relationship to investigational product) occurring through the end of the subject’s participation on the study are to be reported to Amgen.    
For a full list of study procedures, including the timing of each procedure, please refer to Section 7 and Appendix  A. 
Statistical Considerations  
Subjects who receive at least 1 dose of investigational product will be included in the primary 
analysis .  The evaluation period will begin at  the date of randomization and subjects will be 
censored at the last administration of investigational product plus 3 months  or end of study, 
whichever is earlier  (on-treatment approach).  
For the primary endpoint, the proportion of subjects in each treatment group receiving at least 1 RBC transfusion during the evaluation period will be presented with 2-sided 95% CIs .  The 
difference in proportions between treatment groups and the relative risk ratio will be described 
with 2-sided 95% CIs .  Confidence intervals will be derived using normal approximation.  The 
primary analysis will be repeated by subgroups of interest . 
As a sensitivity analysis , the primary analysis will be repeated using all randomized subjects with 
the evaluation period beginning at the date of randomization and subjects will be censored at the 
end of study (on- study approach).  
Sensitivity analyses will also be performed to assess the impact of potential differential follow -up 
on the primary endpoint .  Exposure- adjusted subject incidence of receiving at least 1 RBC 
transfusion will be calculated with 95% CI using Chi -square approximation to the Poisson 
distribution for both on- treatment and on -study approaches.  
For the analyses of the secondary endpoints: total number of units of RBC transfused per subject will be summarized for each treatment group.  Time to first RBC transfusion using both 
on-treatment and on- study approaches will be described for each treatment  group.  Average 
achieved Hb concentration while receiving investigational product will be analyz ed as average Hb 
using the area under th e curve (AUC) method.  Cumulative doses of darbepoetin alfa adjusted for 
investigational  product exposure time will also be described. 
Safety endpoints  will include the descriptive summary of the time to adjudicated event endpoint  
by treatment group, using Kaplan -Meier curves, Kaplan- Meier percentiles, the number of subjects 
censored, and the number of subjects with events.   Subject incidence of adverse events will be 
tabulated by system organ class, high level group term, and preferred term by treatment group.  Adverse events of interest will be tabulated by treatment group.  Subgroup analyses will be 
presented for all adverse events.  
An independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will review unblinded study data on a regular basis throughout the duration of the study .  The DMC may recommend modifying or stopping the 
study, or suspending enrollment.  This recommendation can be based on any safety concerns, lack of efficacy/futility, or preponderance of early evidence of efficacy.  The DMC will conduct an interim analysis , which will occur when approximately 33% of subjects  have completed 12 months 
of planned study follow -up.

2. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
2.1 Disease  
Anemia is a common and debilitating complication of chronic kidney disease ( CKD) .  
It results primarily fr om decreased production of erythropoietin by the kidney 
(Eschbach and Adamson, 1985 ) and becomes increasingly prevalent and severe as 
kidney function declines ( Moranne et al, 2009 ; Astor et al, 2002; Kazmi et al, 2001).  
This renal anemia itself may be severe enough to require RBC transfusions or may 
contribute to the need for a RBC transfusion in patients who experience a clinical event which worsens the anemia (eg , bleeding, infection, or inflammation).   
Avoidance of RBC transfusions is desirable due to the association of transfusions with a number of risks as well as because of blood inventory constraints

 (Goodnough  and Shander, 2007).  Some risks, including transfusion- related acute lung 
injury (TRALI), transfusion associated cardiac overload (TACO), hemolytic reactions, 
and bacterial sepsis, have been associated with transfusion- related death 
(Leo and Pedal, 2010 ; Eder  and Chambers, 2007 ).  Transmission of blood- borne viral 
pathogens such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), human T- lymphotropic virus  
(HTLV), hepatitis B (HBV) or hepatitis C (HCV) is a lesser risk of RBC transfusions due 
to contemporary screening practices, but the risk has not been completely eliminated.  
Concerns remain regarding transmission of pathogens such as West Nile virus  for which 
blood products are not routinely screened ( Busch et al, 2003) .  The possibility for RBC 
transfusions to transmit Creutzfeldt -Jakob disease is also a concern ( Busch et al, 2003).  
Chronic transfusions can also lead to iron overload and its complications (Despotis  et al, 2007 ; Goldman and Vanherweghem, 1987).   
CKD patients are at higher risk for specific complications of transfusions.  These include volume overload and hyperkalemia ( Despotis et al, 2007; Simon and Bove, 1971 ).  
In addition, transfusions may lead to allosensitization ( Murphey and Forsthuber, 2008).  
Allosensitization can increase the time a patient spends on the kidney transplant wait -list 
or even preclude transplant eligibility ( Susal et al, 2009), and has also been associated 
with shorter graft survival ( Seetharam et al, 2010; Opelz, 2005)  and accelerated 
atherosclerosis ( Hill et al, 2011 ). 
2.2 Darbepoetin alfa Background  
Erythropoie sis stimulating agents (ESAs) bind to the erythropoietin receptor and 
stimulate erythropoiesis by the same mechanism as endogenous erythropoietin (EPO) .  
They have been shown to effectively elevate and maintain Hb concentrations in patients 
with renal anemia and reduce transfusion requirements. 
Darbepoetin alfa is an ESA produced in Chinese hamster ovary cells as a secreted 
glycoprotein by recombinant DNA technology.  It is a 165 amino acid protein that 
contains 5 N -linked  oligosaccharide chains, rather than the 3 contained in human EPO .  
The additional carbohydrate chains  increase  the molecular weight and carbohydrate 
content of the glycoprotein, which gives darbepoetin alfa an approximately 3- fold longer 
serum half -life and mean residence time than recombinant human erythropoietin 
(rHuEPO) in animal models and subjects with CKD, allowing extended administration 
dosing intervals ( Macdougall, 2000 ; Egrie et al, 1993).  Details of the chemistry, 
preclinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, toxicology, and clinical experience with darbepoetin alfa are contained in the Investigator’s Brochure.

 Darbepoetin alfa is licensed and approved in the United States , Europe , Canada, 
Australia and a number of other countries for the treatment of anemia in patients w ith 
CKD, including patients on dialysis and patients not on dialysis, and for the treatment of 
anemia in patients with non- myeloid malignancies when anemia is due to concomitantly 
administered chemotherapy.   
2.3 Rationale  
Since their approval, ESAs have been in wide use in CKD patients both on dialysis and 
not on dialysis to raise Hb concentrations  and reduce the need for RBC transfusions.  
Because observational studies had shown an association between anemia and 
increased cardiovascular ( CV) morbidity and mortality in ND-CKD patients 
(Collins,  2003; McClellan et al, 2002 ; Sarnak et al, 2002; Al Ahmad et al, 2001; 
Mann,  1999 ; Levin et al, 1999), clinical trials were conducted in this population to 
evaluate potential CV benefits of ESAs.  Contrary to the hypothesis, 2 large clinical trials did not demonstrate a CV benefit when anemia was treated.  The Correction of Hemoglobin and Outcomes in Renal Insufficiency (CHOIR) study evaluated outcomes in 
subjects with moderate anemia treated with epoetin alfa to Hb concentrations of 13.5 g/dL vs 11.3 g/dL ( Singh et al, 2006).  The CHOIR study identified an increased risk 
for death and serious CV events in the higher Hb target arm (hazard ratio 1.34; 
95% confidence interval [CI] 1.03 to 1.74), the imbalance being mostly for death and 
hospitalization for heart failure.  The Trial to Reduce Cardiovascular Events with 
Aranesp
® Therapy (TREAT) evaluated ND -CKD subjects with moderate anemia and 
type 2 diabetes who were randomized to receive either treatment with darbepoetin alfa 
to a target Hb concentration of 13 g/dL or placebo with rescue darbepoetin alfa therapy if 
Hb concentration fell < 9 g/dL ( Pfeffer et al, 2009).  The TREAT study did not 
demonstrate a benefit on the primary composite CV endpoint of all cause mortality or CV 
event (hazard ratio 1.05; 95% CI 0.94 to 1.17), however, an increased risk of stroke was observed when compared to the placebo group (hazard ratio 1.92; 95% CI 1.38 to 2.68).  The mechanism for the increased risk observed when targeting high Hb concentrations has not been determined.  It has been suggested that exposure to high doses, high 
cumulative dose of ESA, Hb excursions, and rapid Hb rises might contribute to these 
risks.  Thus, there is a desire to define a dosing regimen that can retain the transfusion benefits of ESA treatment while minimizing potential contributing factors listed above.  
Although in CKD patients ESAs have historically been titrated to achieve a predefined Hb concentration, this may not be the only possible dosing strategy.  In particular, a 
 
  Product:  Dar bepoetin alfa  
Protocol Number:  20110226  
Date:  16 December 2013  Page 19 of 67 
 dosing strategy using a fixed dose could mitigate some of the potential contributing 
factors of increased risk while effectively avoiding RBC transfusions.  A fixed dose 
strategy will avoid exposure to high doses entirely and could decrease the cumulative 
dose exposure.  Additionally, by not increasing doses, the occurrence of Hb excursions and rapid Hb rises may be minimized.  A fixed dose may also reduce Hb cycling, which 
may be associated with frequent dose changes, which has been associated with worse 
outcomes in some observational studies of dialysis patients ( Gilbertson et al, 2008; 
Weinhandl et al, 2011 ).  A consistent, fixed dosing strategy, without titration, may also 
simplify therapy for patients and providers, which may potentially improve compliance 
and minimize dosing errors. 
The ability of treatment with a fixed dose to effectively reduce the need for transfusions 
is unknown.  One prospective single arm study designed to use primarily 1 fixed dose of 
epoetin alfa has suggested that such a strategy can reduce RBC transfusions in anemic 
ND-CKD patients ( Provenzano et al, 2004).  During the short 16- week study, 3.7% of 
patients were transfused compared to 11.1% of patients within 6 months prior to 
enrollment.  However, this study enabled the “fixed dose” to be increased or decreased, and less than half the patients were maintained on the original 10,000 unit per week fixed dose of epoetin alfa throughout the study.  
This START -CKD study is designed to describe the benefits and potential risks of a new 
treatment strategy using a fixed dose of darbepoetin alfa.  Anemic ND -CKD subjects , 
without recent E SA use,  will be randomly allocated to treatment with a fixed dose of 
darbepoetin alfa or to treatment with darbepoetin alfa using a Hb- based titration strategy, 
which has been the conventional dosing strategy .  This study will estimate the subject 
incidenc e of RBC transfusions (administered as deemed clinically necessary) in each 
group and the difference in incidence of RBC transfusions between the 2 groups .  
However, determining a preferred dosing regimen will also be based on multiple 
considerations, such  as cumulative darbepoetin alfa dose, total number of units of 
transfusions , Hb concentration, Hb- related parameters (eg, Hb variability, excursions, 
rate of change), and  adverse (eg, CV) events .  Given these considerations, an 
estimation approach was chos en for this study . 
The dosing algorithm that will be used in the Hb- based titration group is intended to 
maintain Hb concentration ≥ 10.0 g/dL , with a starting dose of 0.45 µg/kg, to be 
administered every 4 weeks ( Q4W ).  Model -based simulations were used to select a 
fixed dose that would achieve approximately the same population mean 
 
  Product:  Dar bepoetin alfa  
Protocol Number:  20110226  
Date:  16 December 2013  Page 20 of 67 
 Hb concentration at the end of the s tudy.  The  simulations , conducted in a similar 
fashion as previously published ( Doshi et al, 2010), predicted  that a darbepoetin alfa 
dose of 0.45  µg/kg/Q4W should be used .  
The starting dose is the same for both of the dosing algorithms .  Thus it will be possible 
to analyze the dose received and achieved Hb concentrations  by subgroups of initial 
Hb response  using the same definition of Hb response for both treatment groups . 
2.4 Clinical Hypotheses 
The incidence of RBC transfusions in each treatment group (Hb -based titration group 
and fixed dose group) and their difference will be estimated, and no  formal hypothesis  
will be tested .  The width of the 95% CI of the tran sfusion incidence rate is expected to  
be < 10% (ie, ± 5% around the point estimate) in each group and the width of the 
95% CI of the difference in transfusion incidence rates is expected to be 
< 14% (ie, ± 7% around the point estimate).  The efficacy and safety of each treatment 
group will be described, as these aspects will assist in the determination of a preferred 
dosing regimen.  
3. EXPERIMENTAL PLAN  
3.1 Study Design 
This is a phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double- blind, parallel group study.  Anemic, 
ND-CKD subjects , without recent ESA use,  will be randomized to 1 of 2 dosing 
strategies.  In the Hb -based titration group, darbepoetin alfa doses will be titrated to 
maintain Hb ≥ 10.0 g/dL.  In the other group, subjects will receive a fixed  dose of 
darbepoetin alfa.  All subjects will receive investigational product  (IP) as a subcutaneous 
injection Q4W.  Treatment group, darbepoetin alfa doses, and protocol specified Hb 
concentrations will be blinded to the investigator, subjects and study team.   The overall 
study design is described by a study schema  at the end of the protocol synopsis section.  
The study endpoints are defined in Section 10.1.

Date:  16 December 2013  Page 25 of 67 
 minimum of 14 days and must  not exceed 28 days.  Eligibility criteria will be evaluated 
throughout the screening period.  
Screening procedures are described in Section  7.1.1.   Upon either completion of the 
final screening procedure or determination of  ineligibility,  the investigator or designee 
must  contact the IVR/IWR system .   
If subjects are confirmed as eligible, the IVR/IWR system will continue to the  
randomization call and assign the investigational product.  Subjects must have their first 
dose of investigational product administered on this date.   At the completion of the call , a 
confirmation fax and/or e -mail will be sent to the site to verify that the correct information 
has been entered and to confirm the randomization.  
If subjects are not eligible for the study  due to: 
• the screening Hb concentration only, the IVR/IWR system will notify the investigator 
or designee that the subject is not eligible and record the date of the screen failure 
• reasons other than the screening Hb concentration, the investigator or designee will 
enter the date and reason for screen failure   
Subjects who fail screening may be rescreened as described in Section  7.1.2 beginning 
14 days  after the date of the last screening procedure. 
5.2 Randomization 
Randomization by the IVR/IWR system will be done  in a 1:1 ratio to 1 of the 2 treatment 
groups (Hb- based titration group or fixed  dose group) based on the following 
stratification factors at the time of study entry:  
• Receipt of any RBC transfusion within the 12 months  prior to randomization (yes/no)  
• Site practice setting (nephrology/non- nephrology) , pre-specified by  the specialty of 
the principal investigator  at the time of site initiation   
Randomization will be based on a schedule generated before the start of the study by an 
Amgen representative not involved in the conduct of the study .   
5.3 Site Personnel Access to Individual Treatment Assignments  
The identity of the treatment group assigned to the subject, the protocol specified Hb 
measurements , and the dose of investigational product assigned will be maintained by 
the IVR /IWR system .  The investigator  will be provided with a unique personal 
identification number (PIN) to access the IVR /IWR system  in the event that they need to 
unblind the subject treatment  assignment.  
 
  Product:  Dar bepoetin alfa  
Protocol Number:  20110226  
Date:  16 December 2013  Page 26 of 67 
 The subject, site personnel, and Amgen study personnel and designees will be blinded 
to the treatment group assignment, with the exception of those circumstances where the investigator deems it necessary to break the blind in order to provide appropriate 
medical treatment for the subject.  Unblinding at the study site for any other reason will 
be considered a protocol deviation.  
The principal investigator is strongly encouraged to contact the Amgen study manager  
before unblinding any subject’s treatment assignment, but is required to do so within 
1 working day after the event  and must document the unblinding in the subject’s 
electronic case report form (eCRF) . 
6. TREATMENT PROCEDURES  
6.1 Classification of Products and Medical Devices 
The Amgen Investigational Products used in this study include:   Darbepoetin alfa and 
placebo in a prefilled syringe (PFS) . 
The Investigational Product Instruction Manual (IPIM), a document external to this protocol, contains detailed information regarding the storage, prepa ration, and 
administration of darbepoetin alfa and placebo.  
The medical devices that are provided by Amgen for use in this study include:  A 
modified HemoCue Hb 201+ system hemoglobin analyzer  and an a uto inflate Blood 
Pressure Monitor. 
6.2 Darbepoetin alfa  
Darbepoetin alfa  will be manufactured and packaged by Amgen Inc . and distributed 
using Amgen clinical study drug distribution procedures.  Darbepoetin alfa will be 
presented as a clear, colorless, sterile protein solution in single use PFS in the following 
strengths:  10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 80 , 100, 150, 200, and 300 µg.  
6.3 Placebo 
Placebo will be provided as a clear, colorless, sterile solution in PFS identical to those 
containing the active drug.  
6.4 Dosage, Administration, and Schedule  
Subjects’ Hb will be meas ured Q4W using an modified Hb POC  device provided by 
Amgen.  The device will provide coded values that will be entered into IVR/IWR system at each scheduled dosing visit .  The IVR/IWR system will determine and assign the 
appropriate dose and individual box (es) of investigational product (darbepoetin alfa or 
placebo) for that specific visit  based on the Hb concentration and the dosing algorithms 
 
  Product:  Dar bepoetin alfa  
Protocol Number:  20110226  
Date:  16 December 2013  Page 27 of 67 
 in Section 6.4.1  below.   Each box of investigational product will contain only 1 PFS that 
is to be administered at the study visit for which it has been assigned.   
The protocol specified doses (PSD) for use in this study are 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 80, 
100, 120, 150, 200, 250, and 300 µg.  Subjects who require either a 120 or 250  µg dose 
will require the administration of 2 injections.  When this occurs, in order to maintain the 
blind, a subject in the fixed dose arm will be assigned at random to receive 2 injections 
of investigational product by the IVR /IWR system .  When this is required, the IVR/IWR 
will assign 2 boxes of investigational product for administration during the study visit . 
Investigational product will be administered subcutaneously (SC) by appropriately 
trained medical personnel Q4W  for the duration of the treatment period.  The starting 
dose of investigational product will be 0.45 µg/kg for both groups, using the subject’s 
body weight at screening Visit 1.  The dose obtained from this calculation will be 
rounded down to the next lower PFS strength.    
6.4.1  Dosage Adjustments  
All dose adjustments will be managed using the IVR/IWR  system .  In order to maintain 
the blind, subjects will receive a placebo injection in place of darbepoetin alfa  therapy 
when the dose of study drug is to be withheld per the dosing algorithm , for reasons other 
than elevated SBP.    
The maximum dose of darbepoetin alfa administered at any time during the study will be 300 µg. 
The dose of investigational product may be adjusted based on Hb parameters and SBP 
values.  
6.4.1.1  Dosage Adjustments Based on Systolic Blood Pressure Values  
If the subject’s mean SBP is ≥ 160 mmHg for two consecutive visits (including blood 
pressure 
 m
onitoring visits), the dose of investigational product will be withheld.   
If the subject’s dose is withheld for ≤ 2 consecutive dosing visits, the investigational 
product will be restarted at the subject’s previous dose at the dosing visit when the mean SBP is ≤ 140 mmHg.  
If the subject’s dose is withheld for > 2 consecutive dos ing visits, the  investigational 
product will be restarted on the initial study dose at the dosing visit when the mean SBP is ≤ 140 mmHg.

 6.4.1.2  Dosage Adjustments Based on Hb Parameters  
6.4.1.2.1  Hb-based Titration Group 
Subjects randomized to the Hb- based titration group will have their dose of 
investigational product titrated based on the Hb concentration on the date of the visit, the 
corresponding Hb rate of rise (ROR), and the previously  assigned dose , as outlined in 
Table 1  below.   The Hb ROR will be determined by the protocol specified 
Hb concentrations obtained from the previous dose to the current dose .  
Table 1 .  Dosing Algorithm for Hb-b ased Titration Group

a Subje cts receiving 300 µg who require a dose increase will continue to receive 300 µg 
b Subjects receiving 10 µg who require a dose reduction will receive placebo  
c Restart darbepoetin alfa when Hb < 10.0 g/dL, at next lower PSD 
When darbepoetin alfa therapy is  withheld per the dosing algorithm, placebo will be 
administered.  Once the Hb falls  to < 10.0 g/dL, darbepoetin alfa therapy will be resumed 
at the next lower PSD.  
6.4.1.2.2  Fixed Dose Group  
Subjects randomized to the fixed dose group will receive the same dose as the 
one assigned at the time of randomization for the duration of the treatment period with 
1 exception:  if the Hb is > 12.0 g/dL, darbepoetin alfa  therapy will be withheld and 
placebo administered.  Once the Hb falls to < 10.0 g/dL, darbepoetin alfa therapy will 
resume  at the same dose.   
6.4.1.3  Missed Doses  
If a subject in either group misses a scheduled dose of investigational product  (defined 
as Q4W ± 5 days), this dose will not be administered off schedule.  The missed dose 
and reason should be entered into the eCRF .  For the next dosing  visit, the subject 
should return to their  original visit schedule. 
If a subject misses > 2 consecutive dosing visits , they will be restarted at their initial 
study dose at the next dosing visit .

 6.5 Concomitant Therapy  
Throughout the study, investigators may prescribe any concomitant medications or 
treatments deemed necessary to provide adequate supportive care except for those 
listed in Section 6.8.   
It is recommended that all subjects be iron replete during the study.  Supplemental iron 
therapy should be administered as needed and as tolerated.  The National Kidney 
Foundation Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) guidelin es recommend 
that TSAT be maintained ≥ 20% and fer ritin ≥ 100 ng/m L. 
Blood pressure should be monitored and managed as appropriate.  The KDOQI  
guidelines  recommend to target a  SBP < 130 mmHg and a DBP < 80 mmHg .

while  participating in this study.  
Subjects should not receive commercial ESAs while  receiving investigational product 
during the study.  
7. STUDY PROCEDURES  
Screening assessments and study procedures are outlined in this section and in Appendix  A.  The informed consent must be obtained prior to performing any screening 
or study procedures.   
All on -study visits and d osing should be scheduled from Study Day 1.  It is important to 
perform study procedures and obtain samples at the time points outlined in the protocol.  When it is not possible to perform the study visit at the specified time point, the visit may be performed within the acceptable visit window as defined in Section 7.1.  If a study 
visit is missed , subsequent study visits should resume on the original visit schedule.  
Missed assessments at prior visits should not be duplicated at subsequent visits.  
With the ex ception of the screening and rescreen visits, all study procedures for a vis it 
must be c ompleted on the same day.  
It is the responsibility of the investigator to ensure all procedures are performed according to the protocol.  
7.1 General Study Procedures  
Any blood or serum  sample collected according to the Schedule of Assessments 
(Appendix  A) may be analyzed for any of the tests outlined in the protocol and for any 
tests necessary to ensure subject safety .  This includes testing to ensure analytical

 methods produce reliable and valid data throu ghout the course of the study .  This may 
also include, but is not limited to, investigation of unexpected results, incurred sample 
reanalysis, and analyses for method transfer and comparability.  
If informed consent is provided by the subject,  Amgen may do additional testing on 
remaining samples (ie, residual and back -up) as well as those collected for biomarker 
development as described in Section 7.4.  These samples may be used  to investigate 
and better understand CKD , the dose response and/or prediction of response to 
darbepoetin alfa, characterize antibody response, and characterize aspects of the 
molecule (eg, metabolites).  Results from this analysis will be documented and 
maintained, but may not be reported as part of this s tudy.  
The procedures performed at each study visit are outlined below and in Appendix  A. 
Details regarding each type of procedure are provided in Section 7.2.  
7.1.1  Screening Evaluations  
Informed consent must be obtained before completing any other screening procedures.  
After signing the informed consent form, subjects will be screened in order to assess eligibility for study participation.  The screening window is up to 28 days ; subjects must 
complete 2 visits at least 14 days apart during this period.  If a subject has not met all 
eligibility criteria during or by  the end of the 28- day window, the subject will be registered 
as a screen failure.  Subjects who screen fail may be eligible to rescreen per Section 7.1.2 .   
The following procedures will be completed for all subjects during the first screening 
visit: 
• Informed consent  
• Blood pressure  and pulse 
• Weight  
• eGFR , serum creatinine  
• Hb, using the modified  Hb POC d evice  
• Serum pregnancy test for all women (except for women who are surgically sterile or 
are at least 1 year postmenopausal)

 7.1.4.2  Additional Visits for Blood Pressure Monitoring 
For any subject with a mean SBP ≥ 160 mmHg measured during a rout ine study visit, an 
additional blood pressure monitoring visit is required 2 weeks later.  This visit may be 
completed within ± 5 days of the scheduled visit date.   
For subjects with mean SBP < 160 mmHg an additional study visit for blood pressure monitor ing may also be scheduled 2 weeks after a routine study visit at the discretion of 
the investigator.  This visit may be completed within ± 5 days of the scheduled visit date.  
The procedures and data collected at blood pressure monitoring visits  will includ e: 
• Blood pressure and pulse 
• Concomitant antihypertensive medications  
• Adverse event and serious adverse event assessment  
The SBP obtained during these visits will be entered into the IVR/IWR system.  
7.1.5  Evaluations After End of Investigational Product  
Subjects ending investigational product prior to week 97 will be asked to continue to 
complete scheduled visits and study procedures outlined in Section 7.1.4  for the 
remainder of the treatment period.  At a minimum, subjects must be followed for the 
collection of RBC transfusions and endpoint data  for adjudication.  Refer to Section 8.1 
for additional information.   In addition, serum for anti -erythropoietic protein antibody 
testing will be collected  at the scheduled visit that occurs closest to the receipt of the last 
dose of investigational product .  Adverse events and serious adverse events will be 
collected as described in Section 9. 
7.1.6  Early Termination

7.2 Description of General Study Procedures 
7.2.1  Informed Consent  
All subjects must sign and personally date the IRB approved informed consent before 
any study specific procedures are performed.  See Section 11.1 for further details.  
7.2.2  Medical and Surgical History  
The subject’s complete medical and surgical history will be obtained on Day 1 and 
recorded in the eCRF . 
7.2.3  Physical Examination  
A physical exam will be performed on Day 1 .  Breast, genital, and rectal examinations 
are not required for any study visit unless specific evaluation is warranted.  Weight and 
height should be measured with the subject wearing light clothing and with shoes 
removed.  
The physical examination, including weight,  at EOS visit  will consist of a  follow -up 
examination to monitor for any changes from the Day 1 physical examination.   Any 
clinically significant changes in physical examination per the investigator’s  opinion 
should be recorded on the adverse event  eCRF. 
7.2.4  Blood Pressure  and Pulse  
Blood pressure  and pulse will be obtained using an automated blood pressure machine 
provided by Amgen for purposes of this study .   
Blood pressure measurements should follow  the recommended technique from the 
American Heart Association ( Pickering et al, 2005 ).  The blood pressure should be taken 
with the subject’s arm  supported at heart level using the appropriate sized cuff with the 
subject seated comfortably in a chair with their back supported and both feet on the ground.   Subjects should be resting quietly for at least 5 minutes before taking blood 
pressure measurements.   At the first screening visit, blood pressure will be taken in each 
 
  Product:  Dar bepoetin alfa  
Protocol Number:  20110226  
Date:  16 December 2013  Page 36 of 67 
 arm in triplicate at least 1 minute apart , except when there is a contraindication, such as 
a dialysis vascular access.   The arm with the higher mean blood pressure 
measurements will be recorded and then used at each of the visits for the duration of the 
study  unles s there is a contraindication, such as a dialysis vascular access.  Three 
successive measurements will be taken in the noted arm at least 1 minute apart  during 
subsequent visits .  
If the mean SBP is > 140 mmHg or the mean DBP is > 90 mmHg at any study visit, additional information regarding the management of hypertension (eg, modification 
of antihypertensive medications) will be collected in the eCRF. 
7.2.5  Hemoglobin  
All Hb measurements specified by the protocol for determination of eligibility, dosing , 
and as instructed by Amgen, will be blinded and obtained using an modified Hb POC  
device provided by Amgen.  All measurements should occur  on the day of the study visit 
prior to the administration of investigational product.  The blood sample to be used for 
the Hb measurement will be obtained by venipuncture.  The utilization of blood obtained 
by a finger stick for Hb evaluations is not permitted.  
If a subject’s Hb is < 8.0 g/dL or > 13.0 g/dL, the investigator will be notified by the IVR/IWR system so that he/she may follow -up as clinically indicated.  
In addition, CBCs will be collected as specified in the Schedule of Assessments 
(Appendix  A).  The results of the CBC will remain blinded.  
7.2.6  RBC Transfusions 
RBC transfusions should be performed as deemed necessary by the treating physician and criteria are not stipulated by this study protocol.  All RBC transfusions received while the subject is on-study  will be recorded on the RBC transfusion eCRF.   Information 
regarding the context surrounding transfusions will be collected at each study visit including units of RBCs transfused , the transfusion setting (eg, dialysis center, intensive 
care unit, emergency department), and clinical events (eg, bleeding, surgery) .  This 
informatio n will be  reviewed by an independent  Clinical Endpoint C ommittee (CEC). 
7.2.7  Hospitalizations  and Emergency Department Visits  
All hospitalizations , including observational  stays, and emergency department  visits  that 
occur while the subject is on-study  will be r ecorded on the eCRF, including the primary 
reason for the visit/stay .

 7.2.8  Adverse Events  
The incidence of adverse events will be collected for each subject at all study visits.  A 
serious adverse event that occurs in a subject after signing the informed consent but 
prior to randomization will be recorded on the screening serious adverse event eCRF .  
All adverse events that occur after randomization through 4 weeks  after the last dose of 
investigational product will be recorded on the adverse event eCRF and on the serious adverse event eCRF  if they are serious.  See Section 9 for additional information.  
7.2.9  Concomitant Medications 
Concomitant medications will be collected beginning on Day 1 and recorded on the 
eCRF for this study  as described below .  
The usage of concomitant medications  will be collected every 4 weeks for the duration of 
the study.    
The administration of antihypertensive medications, including the name of the medication, dose, route , frequency,  and dates of administration will be collected at every 
study visit, including any additional visits for blood pressure management.  
The administration of iron, including the name of the medication, dose , route  and dates 
of administration, will be collected.    
The use of commercial ESAs in subjects who are no longer receiving investigational 
product is permitted in this study .  Administration of commercial ESAs while receiving 
investigational product will be documented as a protocol deviation.  For subjects who 
receive commercial ESA s, the name of the medication, dose, route and dates of 
administration will be collected. 
7.2.10  Electrocardiogram  (ECG)  
A standard 12 -lead ECG will be obtained after the subject has been supine for at least 
5 minutes and prior to blood samples being drawn.  The investigator or designated 
physician will review and sign the ECG.  Once signed, the original ECG tracing will be 
retained with the subject’s source documents.  At the request of the sponsor, the original 
ECG tracing may be made available to Amgen.  
7.2.11  Endpoint  Collection  for Adjudication 
Data for the specified endpoints will be collected for adjudication as outlined in the 
endpoint manual that will be provided to the study sites.  Data will be transferred to a CEC for analysis per Amgen instructions.  The original potential endpoint data package will be retained with the subject’s source documents.  
 
  Product:  Dar bepoetin alfa  
Protocol Number:  20110226  
Date:  16 December 2013  Page 38 of 67 
 Clinical events  to be collected for adjudication include:  
• All-cause mortality  
• Stroke, TIA, MI, decompensated heart failure, thromboembolism, and vascular 
access throm bosis  
• The clinical context surrounding RBC transfusions  
7.2.12  Laboratory Assessments 
All screening and on- study laboratory samples, with the exception of Hb samples  
utilizing the  modified Hb POC  device, will be processed and sent to the central 
laboratory.  The central laboratory will be responsible for all screening and on- study 
hematology, serum chemistry, iron, serum pregnancy, spot urine albumin and creatinine, 
and other laboratory tests required.  Amgen or designee will be responsible for 
anti-erythropoietic  protein antibody and anti- HLA antibody assessments, and the central 
laboratory will ship the samples to Amgen or a specialty laboratory for assay testing.  
The central laboratory will provide a study manual that outlines handling, labeling, and 
shipping pr ocedures f or all blood and urine samples.  All blood samples will be obtained 
by venipuncture before investigational product administration.  The date and time of blood and urine collection will be recorded in the source documents at the site.  
Table 2  below outlines the specific analytes for serum chemistry, iron and other testing 
to be conducted on blood and urine samples.

7.3 Antibody Testing Pr ocedures 
7.3.1  Anti-Erythropoietic Antibodies  
Blood samples will be collected from all subjects for the measurement of  
anti-erythropoietic protein antibodies.  Samples testing positive for binding antibodies 
 
  Product:  Dar bepoetin alfa  
Protocol Number:  20110226  
Date:  16 December 2013  Page 39 of 67 
 will also be tested for neutralizing antibodies and may be further characterized for 
quantity/titer, isotype, affinity and presence of immune complexes.  Additional blood 
samples may be obtained to rule out anti -erythropoietic protein antibodies during the 
study.    
Subjects who test positive for neutralizing antibodies at the final scheduled study visit will 
be asked to return for additional follow -up testing.  This testing should occur 
approximately every 12 weeks starting from when the site has been notified of the 
positive result, until:  (1)  neutralizing antibodies are no longer detectable or (2)  the 
subject has been followed for a period of at least 1 year ( ± 4 weeks).  More frequent 
testing (eg, Q4W ) or testing for a longer period of time may be requested in the event of 
safety -related concerns.  Follow -up testing will not be required where it is established 
that the subject did not receive darbepoetin alfa . 
Subjects who test positive for binding, non- neutralizing antibodies and have clinical 
sequelae that are considered potentially related to an anti -erythropoietic protein antibody 
response may also be asked to return for additional follow -up testing.  
7.3.2  Anti-HLA Antibodies  
Samples for assessment of allosensitization will be collected.  Allosensitization is the 
development of an immune response against foreign antigens, and in particular foreign HLA.  The detection of anti -HLA antibodies  (allosensitization) has changed dramatically 
over the last few years, becoming much more sensitive and more specific 
(Murphey  and Forsthuber, 2008).  Given the rapid innovation in the determination of 
allosensitization, samples  collected for anti -HLA antibodies  during the course of the trial 
will be stored until the completion of the study.   Anti-HLA antibodies  will then be 
measured using the state- of-the-art and accepted methods at that time.  
7.4 Biomarker Development  
Biomarkers are objectively measured and evaluated indicators of normal biologic 
processes, pathogenic processes, or pharmacologic responses to a therapeutic 
intervention.  Amgen may attempt to develop blood tests designed to identify subjects 
most likely to respond positively or negatively to darbepoetin alfa .  These samples may 
also be used  to investigate and better understand CKD and characterize aspects of 
darbepoetin alfa .  Biomarker development may be pursued by use of advanced 
biochemical analyses, such as proteomic methods .  If informed consent is provided by 
the subject,  blood samples will be collected for biomarker development on Day  1 and 
 
  Product:  Dar bepoetin alfa  
Protocol Number:  20110226  
Date:  16 December 2013  Page 40 of 67 
 every 24 weeks thereafter for the duration of the study.   Refer to the l aboratory manual 
for detailed collection and handling procedures for all biomarker development samples.  
Sample Storage and Destruction  
These biomarker development samples  and any other components from the cells may 
be stored for up to 20 years from the end of the study to research scientific questions 
related to nephrology  and/or darbepoetin alfa .  The subject retains the right to request 
that the sample material be destroyed at any time by contacting the principal investigator.  The sponsor will be the exclusive owner of any data, discoveries, or derivative materials from the sample materials and is responsible for the destruction of the sample(s) at the request of the subject through the principal investigator or at the end of the storage period or as appropriate (eg, the scientific rationale for 
experimentation with a certain sample type no longer justifies keeping the sample).  
Following the request from the subject, the principal investigator will provide the sponsor with the required study and subject numbers so that any remaining serum  samples and 
any other components from the cells can be located and destroyed.  If a commercial product is developed from this research project, the sponsor will own the commercial product.  The subject will have no commercial rights to such product and will have no commercial rights to the data, information, discoveries, or derivative materials gained or produced from the sample.  
8. REMOVAL AND REPLACEMENT OF SUBJECTS  
8.1 Removal of Subjects  
Subjects have the right to withdraw from the study at any time and for any reason without prejudice to his or her future medical care by the physician or at the institution. 
Subjects (or a legally acceptable representative) can decline to continue receiving 
investigational product at any time during the course of the study.  If this occurs, the 
investigator is to discuss with the subject the appropriate procedures for discontinuation from investigational product and must discuss with  the subject the options for 
continuation of the schedule of  assessments and collection of data, including endpoints 
and adverse events.  These subjects, as well as those who have stopped receiving investigational product for other reasons (eg, initiation of dialysis ), are encouraged to 
continue the schedule of study visits .  If the subject is unable or unwilling to continue the 
schedule of visits : 
• At a minimum, subjects should be followed for the occurrence of RBC transfusions 
and collection of endpoint data for adjudication 
 
  Product:  Dar bepoetin alfa  
Protocol Number:  20110226  
Date:  16 December 2013  Page 41 of 67 
 • The investigator must  document the change in schedule of assessments  and the 
level of  follow -up the subject is permitting:  in person, by telephone/mail, through 
family/friends, in correspondence/communication with other physicians, and/or from 
review of the medical records  
Withdrawal of consent  for a study means that the subject does not wish to receive 
further investigational treatment and does not wish to or is unable to continue further 
study participation; subject data up to withdrawal of consent will be included in the analysis of the study , and where permitted, publically available data can be included 
after withdrawal of consent .  The investigator will discuss with the subject appropriate 
procedures for withdrawal from the study.   
Should a subject (or a legally acceptable representative) request or decide to withdraw 
from the study, all efforts will be made to complete and report the observations as 
thoroughly as possible up to the date of withdrawal.  All information should be reported on the applicable eCRFs.   
Reasons for removal from protocol -required  investigational product  or procedural 
assessments include:  
• subject request to end investigational product administration  
• pregnancy in a female subject (report on Pregnancy Notification Worksheet; 
see Appendix  D) 
• safety concern (eg, due to an adverse event) 
• initiation of dialysis or receipt of a kidney transplant  
• lack of efficacy  (eg, need for a commercial ESA regularly)  
Reasons for removal of a subject from the study include:  
• withdrawal of consent  from the study  
• death  
• lost to follow -up 
• administrative decision by Amgen  
8.2 Replacement of Subjects 
Subjects who withdraw from this study or are removed will not be replaced.  
9. SAFETY DATA COLLECTION, RECORDING, AND REPORTING  
9.1 Adverse Events  
9.1.1  Definition of Adverse Events 
An adverse event is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical trial subject.  The event does not necessarily have a causal relationship with study treatment.  
 
  Product:  Dar bepoetin alfa  
Protocol Number:  20110226  
Date:  16 December 2013  Page 42 of 67 
 The investigator is responsible for ensuring that any adverse events observed by the 
investigator or reported by the subject are recorded in the subject’s medical record.   
The definition of adverse events includes worsening of a pre- existing medical condition.  
Worsening indicates the pre- existing medical condition (eg, diabetes, migraine 
headaches, gout) has increased in severity, frequency, and/or duration, and/or has an 
association with a significantly worse outcome.  A pre- existing condition that has not 
worsened during the study and involves an intervention while on- study, such as elective 
cosmetic surgery or a medical procedure , is not considered an adverse event.  
An adverse device effect is any adverse event related to the use of a medical device.  
Adverse device effects include adverse events resulting from insufficient or inadequate 
instructions for use, adverse events resulting from any malfunction of the device(s) , or 
adverse events resulting from use error or from intentional misuse of the device(s). 
9.1.2  Reporting Procedures for Adverse Events 
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all adverse events observed by the investigator or reported by the subject that occur after randomization through 4 weeks 
after the last dose of investigational product  are reported using the applicable e CRF 
(eg, Adverse Event Summary  eCRF) .  
The investigator must assign the following adverse event attributes:  
• Adverse event diagnosis or syndrome(s), if known (if not known, signs or symptoms),  
• Dates of onset and resolution,  
• Severity [and/or toxicity per protocol],  
• Assessment of relatedness to darbepoetin alfa,  and 
• Action taken  
The adverse event toxicity grading scale used will be the Amgen adverse event standard 
grading score.   The toxicity  grading scale used in this study is described in Appendix  B. 
The investigator must assess whether the adverse event is possibly related to 
darbepoetin alfa.  This relationship is indicated by a “yes” or “no” response to the 
question:  Is there a reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by darbepoetin alfa?  
The investigator must assess whether the adverse event is possibly related to a device.   
This relationship is indicated by a “yes” or “no” response to the question:  Is there a 
reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by a device? 
 
  Product:  Dar bepoetin alfa  
Protocol Number:  20110226  
Date:  16 December 2013  Page 43 of 67 
 The investigator must assess whether the serious  adverse event is possibly related to 
any study -mandated screening procedure.  This relationship is indicated by a “yes” or 
“no” response to the question:  “Is there a reasonable possibility that the event may be 
related to screening procedures?” 
The investigator must assess whether the adverse event is possibly related to any 
study -mandated activity or procedure.  This relationship is indicated by a “yes” or “no” 
response to the question:  “Is there a reasonable possibility that the event may have 
been caused by a study activity/procedure?” 
The investigator is responsible for reviewing laboratory test results and determining 
whether an abnormal value in an individual study subject represents a clinicall y 
significant change from the subject’s baseline values.  In general, abnormal laboratory findings without clinical significance (based on the investigator's judgment) should not be recorded as adverse events.  However, laboratory value changes that require treatment or adjustment in current therapy are considered adverse events.  Where applicable, 
clinical sequelae (not the laboratory abnormality) should be recorded as the adverse 
event.  
The investigator’s clinical judgment will be used to determine whether a subject should be removed from treatment or from the study due to an adverse event.  A subject, or subject’s parent/legal guardian, may also voluntarily withdraw from treatment due to an adverse event.  If the subject requests to withdraw consent  for further participation in the 
study , the subject should be encouraged to undergo, at a minimum, an end- of-study 
assessment.   
9.2 Serious Adverse Events 
9.2.1  Definition of Serious Adverse Events  
A serious adverse event is defined as an adverse event that meets at least 1 of the following serious criteria: 
• fatal 
• life threatening (places the subject at immediate risk of death)  
• requires in -patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization 
• results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• congenital anomaly/birth defect 
• other medically important serious event  
An adverse event would meet the criterion of “requires hospitalization”, if the event 
necessitated an admission to a health care facility (eg, overnight stay).   
 
  Product:  Dar bepoetin alfa  
Protocol Number:  20110226  
Date:  16 December 2013  Page 44 of 67 
 If an investigator considers  an event to be clinically important, but it does not meet any 
of the serious criteria, the event could be classified as a serious adverse event under the 
criterion of “other medically important serious event”.  Examples of such events could include allergic bronchospasm, convulsions, blood dyscrasias,  or events that necessitate 
an emergency room visit, outpatient surgery, or urgent intervention.  
9.2.2  Reporting Procedures for Serious Adverse Events  
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all serious adverse events observed by the investigator or reported by the subject that occur after signing of the informed consent through 4 weeks  after the last dose of investigational product are recorded in 
the subject’s medical record and are submitted to Amgen.  Any serious adverse events 
with a fatal outcome (regardless of possible relationship to investigational product) 
occurring through the end of the subject’s participation on the study are to be reported to 
Amgen .  This would include subjects  who have been re moved from investigational 
product and continued on-study .   
After the protocol -required reporting period defined above, the investigator does not 
need to actively monitor subjects for serious adverse events.  However, if the investigator becomes aware of a serious adverse event after this protocol -required 
reporting period, the investigator will report the event to Amgen within 24 hours following 
the investigator’s knowledge of the event.  Serious adverse events reported outside of the protocol -required re porting period will be captured within the safety database as 
clinical trial cases for the purposes of expedited reporting.  
The serious adverse event must be submitted to Amgen within 24 hours following the 
investigator’s knowledge of the event via the applicable eCRF.  If the electronic data capture (EDC) system is unavailable to the site staff to report the Serious Adverse Event, the information is to be reported to Amgen via an electronic Serious Adverse Event (eSAE) Contingency Report Form within 24 hours of the investigator’s knowledge of the event.  See  Appendix  C for a sample of the Serious Adverse Event 
Worksheet/eSAE Contingency Report Form.  When the first notification of a Serious Adverse Event is reported to Amgen via the eSAE Contingency Report Form, the data 
must be entered into the EDC system when the system is again available.  
The investigator must assess whether the serious adverse event is possibly related to any study -mandated activity or procedure.   This relationship is indicated by a “yes” or 
“no” response to the question:  “Is there a reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by a study activity/procedure”?  
 
  Product:  Dar bepoetin alfa  
Protocol Number:  20110226  
Date:  16 December 2013  Page 45 of 67 
 The investigator is expected to follow reported serious adverse events unt il stabilization 
or reversibility.  
New information relating to a previously reported serious adverse event must be 
submitted to Amgen.   All new information for serious adverse events must be sent to 
Amgen within 24 hours following knowledge of the new info rmation.  The invest igator 
may be asked to provide additional follow -up information, which may include a discharge 
summary or extracts from the medical record.   Information provided about the serious 
adverse event must be consistent with that recorded on t he applicable e CRF 
(eg, Adverse Event Summary eCRF).  
If a subject is permanently withdrawn from the study because of a serious adverse event, this information must be submitted to Amgen. 
To comply with worldwide reporting regulations for serious adverse ev ents, the treatment 
assignment of subjects who develop serious, unexpected, and related adverse events 
may be unblinded by Amgen before submission to regulatory authorities.  Investigators 
will receive notification of related serious advers e events reports  sent to regulatory 
authorities in accordance with local requirements.   
Amgen will report adverse events and/or suspected unexpected serious adverse 
reactions as required to regulatory authorities, investigators/institutions, and IRBs/IECs in compliance with all reporting requirements according to local regulations and good clinical practice.  
The investigator is to notify the appropriate IRB/ IEC of serious adverse events occurring 
at the site and other adverse event reports received from Amgen, in accordance with local procedures and statutes.   
9.3 Pregnancy and Lactation Reporting  
If a pregnancy occurs in a female subject, or female partner of a male subject, while the subject is taking protocol specified product and for 4 weeks  after end of treatment , the 
pregnancy should be reported to Amgen’s global Pregnancy Surveillance Program  within 
24 hours of the investigator’s knowledge of the event of a pregnancy.  Report  a 
pregnancy on the Pregnancy Notification Worksheet (Appendix  D).  The Pregnancy 
Surveillance Program will seek to follow the pregnant woman throughout her pregnancy and her baby up to 12 months after birth.  
If a lactation case occurs while the female subject is taking protocol -required therapies 
and for 4 weeks after end of treatment, the lactation case should be reported to Amgen’s 
 
  Product:  Dar bepoetin alfa  
Protocol Number:  20110226  
Date:  16 December 2013  Page 46 of 67 
 global Lactation Surveillance Program (LSP) within  24 hours of the investigator’s 
knowledge of the lactation case.  Report a lactation case on the Lactation Notification 
Workshee t (Appendix  E).

10.1.2  Full Analysis Set  
The full analysis set will include all randomized subjects who receive at least 1 dose of 
investigational product.  Subjects will be analyzed according to their randomized 
treatment assignment.  
10.1.3  Subgroups and Covariates  
Subgroups and covariates to be considered include the stratification factors used 
at randomization, and  the following baseline factors: age, sex, race, baseline 
Hb concentration and baseline eGFR.   Subgroups are defined as  
• Age: < 65, ≥ 65 and < 75, ≥ 75 years  
• Gender: Female, Male  
• Race: White, Black, Other  
• Baseline Hb concentrations: <9.0, 9.0 – < 9.5, 9.5 – < 10.0 g/dL  
• Baseline eGFR: < 30.0, ≥ 30.0 mL/min/1.73m2 
Additional analyses may be performed if other prognostic factors emerge in this study or 
in this population.  
10.2 Sample Size Considerations  
The objective of the study is to provide estimations with acceptable precision.  Thus, t he 
sample size is chosen to ensure that the width of the 95% confidence interval ( CI) for the 
proportion of subject s who receive at least 1 RBC transfusion in each treatment group 
will be ≤ 10% (ie,  ± 5% around the point estimate), assuming the proportion to be 25%.  
The choice of the precision of the estimated transfusion rate is based on clinical 
relevance and experience.   The estimated proportion of 25% of subjects  receiving at 
least 1 RBC transfusion is based on post hoc analyses in both treatment groups of 
TREAT of subjects who met the eligibility criteria for this study (Amgen data on file)  and 
transfusion rates observed in other  studies (Provenzano et al, 2004; Lawler  et al, 2010).  
 
  Product:  Dar bepoetin alfa  
Protocol Number:  20110226  
Date:  16 December 2013  Page 48 of 67 
 To ensure the 95% CI with a width  of ≤ 10%, 300 subjects per group will be needed to 
enroll into the study.  In order to ensure this precision can be maintained for sensitivity 
analyses, 20% drop out  is accounted for, and  enrollment of  375 subjects per treatment 
group is planned .  This to tal sample size of 750 subjects will also ensure that the width 
of the 95% CI of the difference in transfusion incidence rates will be ≤ 14% 
(ie, ± 7% around the point estimate), assuming the proportion of subjects receiving at 
least 1 RBC transfusion duri ng the study in both treatment groups is 25%.   All 
confidence interval s are derived using normal approximation.  
10.3 Access to Individual Subject Treatment Assignments by Amgen or 
Designees 
Individual subject treatment assignments will be maintained by the IVR/ IWR system.  
Only t he Data Monitoring Committee (DMC)  and the supporting independent biostatistics 
group will have access to unblinded data .  Members of the Amgen study team will not 
have access to unblinded data until the study is unblinded for the final analysis.   
The external, independent biostatistics group will provide unbl inded results, including 
aggregate and subject level data, to the DMC  for regular data reviews.  The role of the 
DMC is discussed in Section 10.4.  Any unplanned unblinding occurring during the study 
period will be documented and reported in the final clinical study report.  
Amgen s taff from the Clinical Supply Chain  Management  and Biological Sample 
Management  departments will not be blinded to the treatment assignments in this study.  
10.4 Interim Analysis and Early Stopping Guidelines 
Prior to the completion of the recruitment period, the sponsor may conduct a reassess ment of  the study assumptions (eg, transfusion rate) based on blinded 
aggregated data  and revise the sample size in order to ensure that the desired precision 
of transfusion rate estimates can be achieved.  
An independent, external  DMC will review unblinded study data throughout the duration 
of the study  and may request additional data.  If warranted, the  DMC can recommend 
modifying or stopping the study , or suspending enrollment .  This recommendation can 
be based on any safety  concerns , lack of efficacy/futility, or preponderance of early 
evidence of efficacy .  The DMC will convene approximately once every 3-6 months .  The 
DMC will oversee an interim analysis to assess the totality of the data , which will occur when approximately 33% of subjects have completed 12 months of planned study 
follow -up.

 10.5 Planned Methods of Analysis  
10.5.1  General Approach/Consi derations  
Descriptive statistics will be presented for all endpoints by treatment group.  For 
continuous variables, these include number of observations, mean, standard error (SE) and/or standard deviation (SD), median, 25
th percentile (Q1), 75 th percentil e (Q3), 
minimum and maximum.  For categorical variables, the frequency and percentage are presented.  For time to event endpoints: Kaplan- Meier curves, Kaplan- Meier percentiles, 
the number of subjects censored, and the number of subjects with events  will b e 
summarized .  Confidence intervals will be constructed as 2-sided at the 95% level.   
Summaries of laboratory data, Hb and dose related parameters , and vital signs will be 
completed using the full analysis set, limited to measurements obtained while the subject 
is receiving the investigational product.  
10.5.2  Analysis of Key Study Endpoints  
10.5.2.1  Efficacy Endpoints  
The primary analysis  of the primary endpoint will be conducted using the full analysis 
set.  The evaluation period will begin  from the date of randomization and subjects will be 
censored at the last dose of investigational product  plus 3 months  or end of study, 
whichever is earlier  (on-treatment approach).  For the primary endpoint, the proportion of 
subjects in each treatment group receiving at least 1 RBC tr ansfusion during the 
evaluation period will be presented with 2-sided 95%  CIs.  The difference in proportions 
between treatment groups and the relative risk ratio will be described with 2-sided 
95% CIs.  Confidence intervals will be derived using normal approximation. 
The primary analysis will be repeated  by subgroups of stratification factors used at 
randomization, and also by subgroups  of age, gender, race, baseline Hb concentrations 
and baseline eGFR.  
Sensitivity analys es of the primary endpoint  will be repeated using all randomized 
subjects with the evaluation period beginning at  the date of randomization and subjects 
will be censored at the end of study (on- study approach).   
Sensitivity analyses will be performed to assess the impact of potential differential follow up on the primary endpoint .  Exposure- adjusted subject incidence of receiving at least 
1 RBC transfusion will be calculated with 95% CI using Chi -square approximation to the 
Poisson distribution for both on -treatment and on -study approaches.   Other sensitivity 
analyses, such as completer analyses for investigational product and study, may be performed as appropriate.

 The reason for investigational product discontinuation will be reviewed to evaluate its 
relationship and potential impact on the primary endpoint.   Additional transfusion related 
information collected will be summarized descriptively by treatment group using both on 
treatment approach and on study approach.  These include the  transfusion setting and 
clinical context surrounding tr ansfusions.  These summaries will be of transfusion event 
incidence instead of subject incidence.  
10.5.2.2  Secondary Endpoints  
Total number of units of RBC transfused per subject will be described for each treatment 
group, and will be a nalyzed using a negative binomial regression model which will 
include the stratification factors used at randomization.  As a sensitivity analysis, 
exposure adjusted event incidence of total number of units RBC transfused will be 
presented with 95% CI using Chi -square approximation to the Poisson distribution .  
These analyses will be performed using both on -treatment and on -study approaches.  
Time to first RBC transfusion using both on- treatment and on -study approaches will be 
analyzed by each treatment group with Kaplan- Meier curves, K aplan- Meier percentiles, 
the number of subjects censored, and the number of subjects transfused.   A supportive 
analysis will be performed using Cox proportional hazards model ( Cox, 1972) stratified 
by the stratification factors used at randomization to evaluate the difference between the 
treatment groups .  The hazard ratio and its corresponding 95% CI will be estimated.  
Average achieved Hb concentration while receiving investigational product will be described as average Hb using the area under the curve (A UC) method.   The median of 
the difference in achieved Hb concentration (Hodges –Lehmann estimate) between 
treatment groups will be calculated and 2 -sided 95% confidence limits  will be derived by 
using a nonparametric Wilcoxon rank -sum statistic ( Holander and Wolfe, 1973).  
Cumulative doses of darbepoetin alfa adjusted for investigation product exposure time 
will also be summarized, and the median of the difference (Hodges –Lehmann estimate) 
between treatment groups will be calculated and 2 -sided 95% confidence  limits  will be 
derived by using a nonparametric Wilcoxon rank -sum statistic.  
10.5.2.3  Safety Endpoints 
Time to adjudicated event endpoints, such as composite endpoints of mortality and CV 
morbidity, all-cause mortality, and fatal and non -fatal CV events, will be summarized by 
each treatment group with Kaplan- Meier curves, Kaplan- Meier percentiles, the number 
of subjects censored, and the number of subjects with events.  
 
  Product:  Dar bepoetin alfa  
Protocol Number:  20110226  
Date:  16 December 2013  Page 51 of 67 
 Adverse events will be coded using the most current version of MedDRA.  Subject 
incidence of all treatment -emergent adverse events will be tabulated by system organ 
class, high level group term, and preferred term by randomized treatment group.   Tables 
of fatal adverse events, serious adverse events, adverse events leading to withdrawal 
from investiga tional product or from study, and significant treatment -emergent adverse 
events,  will also be provided.  Adverse events of interest will be tabulated by each 
randomized treatment group.  Subgroup analyses (by age group, race, and gender) will be presented for all adverse events.  
Vital signs at each study visit will be summarized descriptively by treatment group.  Average blood pressure on treatment will be described as average value using the 
AUC method , and medication changes secondary to elevated blood pressure will be 
summarized descriptively in each treatment group. 
The incidence and percentage of subjects who develop anti -erythropoietic protein 
antibodies (binding and if positive, neutralizing) at any time will be tabulated by treatment 
group.  
10.5.2.4  Explorato ry Endpoints 
All exploratory endpoints, except otherwise mentioned in this section,  will be described  
by each treatment group .  In addition to Hb concentration and change from baseline at 
each study visit, the subgroups of Hb concentrations , will also be p resented.  
Number of days hospitaliz ed will be summarized by treatment group using the 
on-treatment approach. 
Achieved Hb concentration and cumulative dose over time will be summarized by the 
initial Hb responsiveness and treatment group.  
Anti-HLA antibodies over time will be tabulated by each treatment group.  
10.5.3  Additional  Analyses  
The number and percentage of subjects screened, randomized, and received at least  
1 dose of investigational product  will be presented.  The study disposition and 
investigational product disposition will be tabulated by the reason for ending study and 
ending investigational product respectively for  each treatment group. 
Demographic , medical history  and baseline characteristics will be described by 
treatment group.   Use of selected concomitant medications  at baseline and on- study , 
such as  iron therapies and other erythropoietic  agents , will be summarized by treatment

scheduled visit by treatment group.  
11. REGULATORY OBLIGATIONS  
11.1 Informed Consent  
An initial generic informed consent form  (ICF)  is provided for the investigator to prepare 
the informed consent document to be used at his or her site.  Updates to the template 
will be communicated by letter from the Amgen study manager to the investigator.  The written informed consent document should be prepared in the language(s) of the potential patient population.  
Before a subject’s participation in the clinical study, the investigator is responsible for obtaini ng written informed consent from the subject after adequate explanation of the 
aims, methods, anticipated benefits, and potential hazards of the study and before any protocol specific  screening procedures or any investigational products are administered.   
The investigator is also responsible for asking the subject if the subject has a primary care physician and if the subject agrees to have his/her primary care physician informed of the subject’s participation in the clinical study.  If the subject agrees to such notification, the investigator shall inform the subject’s primary care physician of the subject’s participation in the clinical study.  If the subject does not have a primary care 
physician and the investigator will be acting in that capacity, the investigator should 
document such in the subject’s medical record .  The acquisition of informed consent and 
the subject’s agreement or refusal of his/her notification of the primary care physician should be documented in the subject’s medical records, and the informed consent form should be signed and personally dated by the subject  and by the person who conducted 
the informed consent discussion.  The original signed informed consent form should be retained in accordance with institutional policy, and a copy of the signed consent form should be provided to the subject.  
If a potential subject is illiterate or visually impaired and does not have a legally 
acceptable representative, the investigator must provide an impartial witness to read the 
informed consent  form to the subject and must allow for questions.  Thereafter, both the 
subject and the witness must sign the informed consent form to attest that informed consent was freely given and understood.

 11.2 Independent  Ethics Committee/Institutional Review Board  
A copy of the protocol, proposed informed consent form, other written subject 
information, and any proposed advertising material must be submitted to the IEC/IRB  for 
written approval.  A copy of the written approval of the protocol and ICF must be 
received by Amgen before recruitment of subjects into the study and shipment of Amgen 
investigational product. 
The investigator must submit and, where necessary, obtain approval from the IEC/IRB  
for all subsequent protocol amendments and changes to the informed consent 
document.  The investigator should notify the IEC/IRB of deviations from the protocol or 
serious adverse events occurring at the site and other adverse event reports received from Amgen, in accordance with local procedures.  
The investigator will be r esponsible for obtaining annual IEC/IRB  approval  /renewal 
throughout the duration of the study.  Copies of the i nvestigator’s reports and the 
IEC/IRB  continuance of approval must be sent to Amgen.  
11.3 Subject Confidentiality  
The investigator must ensure that the subject’s confidentiality is maintained:   
• On the eCRFs or other documents submitted to Amgen, subjects should be identified 
by a subject identification number only, with a complete and accurate date of birth on 
the demographics eCRF.   
• For Serious Adverse Events reported to Amgen subjects should be identified by their 
initials, date of birth, and a subject identification number.   
• Documents that are not for submission to Amgen (eg, signed informed consent forms) should be kept in strict confidence by the investigator.  
In compliance with Federal regulations/International Conference on Harmonisation ( ICH) 
Good Clinical Practice ( GCP ) Guidelines,  it is required that the investigator and 
institution permit authorized representatives of the company, of the regulatory agency(s), 
and the IEC/IRB  direct access to review the subject’s original medical records for 
verification of study related procedures and data.  Direct access includes examining, 
analyzing, verifying, and reproducing any records and reports that are important to the 
evaluation of the study.  The investigator is obligated to inform and obtain the consent of the subject to permit named representatives to have access to his/her study  related 
records, including personal information, without violating the confidentiality of the subject.

 11.4 Investigator Signatory Obligations  
Each clinical study report should be signed by the investigator or, in the case of 
multicenter studies, the coordinating investigator.  
The coordinating investigator, identified by Amgen, will either be:  
• a recognized expert in the therapeutic area  
• an investigator who provided significant contributions to either the design or 
interpretation of the study  
• an investigator contributing a high number of eligible subjects  
12. ADMINISTRATIVE AND LEGA L OBLIGATIONS  
12.1 Protocol Amendments and Study Termination  
If Amgen amends the protocol, agreement from the investigator must be obtained.  The 
IEC/IRB  must be informed of all amendments and give approval.  The investigator  must  
send a copy of the approval letter from the IEC/IRB  to Amgen.  
Amgen reserves the right to terminate the study at any time.  Both Amgen and the 
investigator reserve the right to terminate the investigator’s participation in the study 
according to the study contract.  The investigator should notify the IEC/IRB  in writing of 
the study’s completion or early termination and send a copy of the notification to Amgen . 
Subjects may be eligible for continued treatment with Amgen investigational product by 
an extension protocol or as provided for by the local country’s regulatory mechanism.  However, Amgen reserves the unilateral right, at its sole discretion, to determine whether to supply Amgen investigational product, and by what mechanism, after termination of the trial and before it is available commercially.  
12.2 Study Documentation and Archive  
The investigator should maintain a list of appropriately qualified persons to whom he/she has delegated study duties.  All persons authorized to make entries and/or corrections on eCRFs will be included on the Amgen Delegation of Authority Form.  
Source documents are original documents, data, and records from which the subject’s eCRF data are obtained.  These include but are not limited to hospital records, clinical 
and office charts, laboratory and pharmacy records, diaries, microfiches, radiographs, and correspondence. 
In this study, the ETO System captures the following data points and these are 
considered source data:   hemoglobin.  
 
  Product:  Dar bepoetin alfa  
Protocol Number:  20110226  
Date:  16 December 2013  Page 55 of 67 
 The investigator and study staff are responsible for maintaining a comprehensive and 
centralized filing system of all study related  (essential) documentation, suitable for 
inspection at any time by representatives from Amgen and/or applicable regulatory authorities.  Elements should include:  
• Subject files containing completed eCRF,  informed consent forms, and subject 
identification list  
• Study files containing the protocol with all amendments, investigator’s brochure, 
copies of prestudy documentation, and all correspondence to and from the IEC/IRB 
and Amgen  
• If kept, proof of receipt/delivery sheet, Investigational Product Accountability Record, 
Return of Investigational Product for Destruction, Final Investigational Product 
Reconciliation Statement (if applicable), and all drug related  correspondence 
In addition, all original source documents supporting entries in the eCRFs must be 
maintained and be readily available.  
Retention of study documents will be governed by the Clinical Trial Agreement.  
12.3 Study Monitoring and Data Collection  
The Amgen representative and regulatory authority inspectors are responsible for 
contacting and visiting the investigator for the purpose of inspecting the facilities and, 
upon request, inspecting the various records of the clinical study (eg, eCRFs and other 
pertinent data) provided that subject confidentiality is respected.  
The Amgen monitor is responsible for verifying the eCRFs at regular intervals throughout 
the study to verify adherence to the protocol; completeness, accuracy, and consistency 
of the data; and adherence to local regulations on the conduct  of clinical research.  The 
monitor should have access to subject medical records and other study related records 
needed to verify the entries on the eCRFs.  
The investigator agrees to cooperate with the monitor to ensure that any problems detected in the course of these monitoring visits, including delays in completing eCRFs, 
are resolved.  
In accordance with ICH GCP and the sponsor’s audit plans, this study may be selected for audit by representatives from Amgen’s Global Compliance Auditing function (or designees).  Inspection of site facilities (eg, pharmacy, drug storage areas, laboratories) 
and review of study related records will occur to evaluate the study conduct and 
compliance with the protocol, ICH GCP, and applicable regulatory requirements.  
 
  Product:  Dar bepoetin alfa  
Protocol Number:  20110226  
Date:  16 December 2013  Page 56 of 67 
 Data capture for this study is planned to be electronic:  
• All source documentation supporting entries into the eCRFs must be maintained and 
readily available.  
• Updates to eCRFs will be automatically documented through the software’s “audit 
trail”.  
• To ensure the quality of clinical data across all subjects and sites, a clinical data 
management review will be performed on subject data received at Amgen.  During 
this review, subject data will be checked for consistency, omissions, and any 
apparent discrepancies.  In addition, the data will be reviewed for adherence to the 
protocol and GCP.  To resolve any questions arising from the clinical data 
management review process, data queries will be created in the EDC system 
database for site resolution and closed by Amgen rev iewer.  
• The principal investigator signs only the Investigator Verification Form for this 
electronic data capture study.  This signature will indicate that the principal 
investigator inspected or reviewed the data on the eCRF, the data queries, and the 
site notifications, and agrees with the content.  
Amgen (or designee) will perform self -evident corrections to obvious data errors in the 
clinical trial database, as documented in the Study Specific Self Evident Corrections 
Plan.  Examples of obvious data errors that may be corrected by Amgen (or designee) include deletion of obvious duplicate data (eg, same results sent twice with the same date with different visit —week 4 and early termination) and clarifying “other, specify” if 
data are provided (eg, race, physical examination).   Each investigative site will be 
provided a list of the types of corrections applied to study data at the initiation of the trial and at study closeout.   
12.4 Language 
All written information and other material to be used by subjects and investigative staff must use vocabulary and language that are clearly understood.  Consult the country 
specific  requirements for language requirements.  
12.5 Publication Policy  
To coordinate dissemination of data from this study, a publication committee consisting  
of members of the executive committee  and appropriate Amgen staff  will be formed , the 
governance and responsibilities of which are set forth in a Publication Charter .  The 
committee is expected to solicit input and assistance from other investigators and to 
collaborate with authors and Amgen staff as appropriate as defined in the Publication 
Charter .  Membership on the committee (both for executive committee members  and 
Amgen staff) does not guarantee authorship—the criteria described below should be met for every publication.  
 
  Product:  Dar bepoetin alfa  
Protocol Number:  20110226  
Date:  16 December 2013  Page 57 of 67 
 Authorship of any publications resulting from this study will be determined on the basis 
of the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE)  
Recommendations for the Conduct, Reporting, Editing and Publication of 
Scholarl y Work in Medical Journals , which states:  
• Authorship credit should be based on (1) substantial contributions to conception and 
design, acquisition of data, or analysis and interpretation of data; (2) drafting the 
article or revising it critically for important intellectual content; (3) final approval of the version to be published; (4) and agreement to be accountable for all aspects of 
the work in ensuring that questions related to the accuracy or integrity of any 
part of the work are appropriately investigated and resolved.  Authors should 
meet conditions 1, 2, 3, and 4. 
• When a large, multicenter group has conducted the work, the group should identify 
the individuals who accept direct responsibility for the manuscript.  These individuals 
should fully meet the criteria for authorship defined above.  
• Acquisition of funding, collection of data, or general supervision of the research 
group, alone, does not justify authorship.  
• All persons designated as authors should qualify for authorship, and all those who 
quali fy should be listed.  
• Each author should have participated sufficiently in the work to take public responsibility for appropriate portions of the content.  
All publications (eg, manuscripts, abstracts, oral/slide presentations, book chapters) 
based on this study must be submitted to Amgen for corporate review.  The Clinical 
Study Agreement among the institution, principal investigator, and Amgen will detail the procedures for, and timing of, Amgen’s review of publications.

   Amendment 1 
Protocol Title:  START -CKD:  Strategies Using Darbepoetin alfa to Avoid 
Transfusions in Chronic Kidney Disease 
 
Amgen Protocol Number (Darbepoetin alfa)  20110226 
 
Amendment Date:  03 April 2013  
 
Rationale:  
The key purpose of this amendment is to  provide additional measures to improve blood 
pressure control in subjects enrolled in the START -CKD study who are receiving 
investigational product .  
The following changes have been made throughout the protocol:   
• The protocol eligibility criteria have been  modified and subjects with a mean systolic 
blood pressure > 140 mmHg or a mean diastolic blood pressure > 9 0 mmHg  at both 
screening visits will be excluded  
• Additional visits have been added for subjects with elevated blood pressures.  These 
blood pressu re monitoring visits will be required for subjects with a mean systolic 
blood pressure ≥ 160mmHg and may be conducted at the investigators discretion for 
those whose mean systolic blood pressure is < 160 mmHg    
• The dosing algorithm has been modified such that  investigational produc t will be 
withheld if a subject’s  mean systolic blood pressure is ≥ 160 mmHg for 3 consecutive 
visits (including blood pressure monitoring visits) and restarted only when the mean 
systolic blood pressure is ≤ 140 mmHg  
• Additional information regarding antihypertensive medication use will be collected at 
each study visit  
• Additional information regarding the investigational hemoglobin point of care device 
for the collection of study specific hemoglobin concentrations and the automated 
blood pressure monitor for the collection of blood pressure measurements has been 
provided. Both of these devices are provided by Amgen for use in this trial and the results obtained are incorporated into the dosing algorithm.  
Additional clarifications and administrative changes h ave also been made.

Based on Harrell (2015), a minimum of 15 patients per predictor

patients  would provide approximately 19  patients per each of 6

preoperative worst NRS pain score with movement over past 24 
hours, boney work  (yes vs. no), age, sex, and BMI).

1.0 INTRODUCTION  
Rotator cuff surgery is mostly performed on an outpatient basis, and many patients still 
experience moderate to severe pain after surgery, despite the use of regional anesthesia 
and opioids. Among shoulder surgery patients receiving lon g-acting nerve blocks, the worst 
pain typically coincides with recession of peripheral nerve b lockade. Interscalene nerve 
block is an effective regional anesthesia technique that involves injection of local anesthetic 
near the brachial plexus resulting in excellent postoperative analgesia (Hadzic et a l. 2005, 
Kinnard et al. 1994). As the sensory blockade wears off, however, it is not uncommon for 
patients to experience moderate to severe pain and report high pain scores after surgery 
(Cheng et al. 2013, Gadsden et al. 2011). There is also  considerable variability in 
anesthesiologists’ practice with regard to regional techniques, intraoperative management, 
and patient education that can influence postoperative analgesia.  
 
Pain control after surgery has a number of important implications. Adequate analgesi a 
improves patient satisfaction and facilitates the process of rehabilitation. On the other hand, 
uncontrolled pain is a common cause of distress and unplanned emergency department and 
urgent care visits (Navarro et al. 2018). Furthermore, patients with po orly controlled acute 
pain are at risk for developing chronic pain.  
 
Clinical pathways are based on the concept of a multimodal approach to improving recovery 
after surgery (Kehlet et al. 1997). These pathways emphasize the importance of patient 
education a nd using multiple approaches to treating postoperative pain rather than relying 
on a single modality or technique of analgesia (White et al. 2005).  These principles have 
been applied for total shoulder arthroplasty and demonstrated low pain scores after s urgery 
(Goon et al. 2014). The aim of this study is to evaluate pain outcomes with arthroscopic 
rotator cuff surgery after implementing a clinical pathway that incorporates patient 
education, long -acting nerve block, and preemptive multimodal analgesia.  Worst pain is 
chosen as the primary outcome because it is a  well-validated endpoint for evaluating a pain -
reduction treatment effect (Atkinson et al. 2010, Mendoza et al. 2006) , and it has been used 
in prior investigations (Vandepitte et al. 2017).

ADVERSE EVENT ASSESSMENT  
All Adverse Events (AEs) will be reported in the final study report.  Definitions for Adverse 
Event (AE) used in this study are listed below and are based on FDA and international 
guidelines:  
 
8.1 Adverse Event (AE)  
Participation in this research involves the potential risk of a break of confidentiality to 
stored health information. HSS tries to minimize those risks by (i) removing some 
direct identifiers from stored information (i.e., names, social security numbers, 
 
  
 
Confidential  Page 11 of 14 
 
medical record numbers); (ii) securing, in a separate location, and limiting access to 
information that wo uld be identifiable; and (iii) limiting access to information stored to 
HSS investigators.  
The likelihood of a breach of confidentiality is minimal.  
8.2 Serious Adverse Events (SAE)  
N/A 
8.3 Subsequent Surgical Interventions Definitions  
N/A 
8.4 Adverse Event Reporting  
All adverse events will be reported to the DSMB and IRB within five working days of 
the event.  
9.0 INVESTIGATOR RESPONSIBILITIES, RECORD AND REPORTS  
 
9.1 Subject Consent and Information  
Written/signed consent will be collected from participants in the holding area  before surgery.  
 
9.2 Subject Data Protection  
o HSS tries to minimize those risks by (i) removing some direct identifiers from 
information stored [(i.e., names, social security numbers, medical record 
numbers)]; (ii) securing, in a separate location, and limiting access to information 
linking codes (i.e ., linkage codes) assigned to the registry information with direct 
participant identifiers; and (iii) limiting access to information stored to HSS 
investigators.  
o Access to the REDCap program is password -protected, and access to a specific 
study's informat ion within the program is limited to the research assistant and 
other IRB -approved study personnel who have been given permission to view 
and/or enter study data. REDCap program access is authorized by the CTSC; 
particular study access is granted by the re search assistant. For data exports, 
fields marked as protected health information (PHI) in REDCap will be de -
identified, if feasible.  
o All transmission of data will occur via encrypted networks in password -protected 
files. Any paper -based data sheets utiliz ed for the study will have personal 
identifiers removed whenever possible and will be stored in the department's 
locked office. Each subject will be assigned a unique study number for 
identification, and that number will not be derived from or related to i nformation 
about the individual. Presentations and publications that result from this study will 
not contain any individual identifiers (at most the unique study numbers may be

privacy.

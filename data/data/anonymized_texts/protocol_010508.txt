 4. INTRODUCTION 
The intent of this document is to provide guidance for analyses of data for this Phase 2a study. 
This statistical analysis plan ( SAP) has been developed after review of the Clinical Study Protocol 
203PF201 (version 4 dated 16 July 2015).  
This SAP describes the planned analys es to evaluate  the safety, tolerability, pharma cokinetics 
(PK), immunogenicity, and impact on bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and peripheral blood 
biomarkers of multiple doses of STX-100 (BG00011) in subjects with idiopathic pulmonary 
fibrosis (IPF). Please n ote that study drug names STX -100 and BG00011 are equivalent, and the 
study drug will be referred to as BG00011 in the SAP and associated tables, figures, and listings 
(TFLs) .  A detailed description of the planned TFLs to be presented in the clinical study report 
(CSR) is provided in the accompanying TFL shell document. This SAP must be finalised prior to the lock of the clinical database and unblinding for this study. When the SAP and TFL shells are 
agreed upon and finalized, they will serve as the template for this study’s CSR. 
This version 2.0 SAP s upersedes the statistical considerations identified in the protocol and the 
statistical considerations identified in the version 1.0 SAP dated 06 March 2012; where 
considerations are substantially different, they will be so identified. If additional analys es are 
required to supplement the planned analyses described in this SAP, they will be identified in the CSR. Any substantial deviations from this SAP will be agreed upon between Biogen MA  Inc. and 
 and identified in the CSR.  
This SAP is  written with consideration of the recommendations outlined in the International 
Conference on Harmonization (ICH) E9 Guideline entitled Guidance for Industry: Statistical Principles for Clinical Trials
1 and the ICH E3 Guideline entitled Guidance for Indus try: Structure 
and Content of Clinical Study Reports2. 
 
5. STUDY OBJECTIVE S  
Primary Objective:  
• To evaluate the safety and tolerability of subcutaneously ( SC) administered, multiple 
escalating doses of  BG00011 (humanized monoclonal antibody directed against the αvβ6 
integrin) in subjects with IPF  
Secondary Objectives:  
• To estimate the PK parameters after the first dose and after the last dose of multiple, 
escalating doses of BG00011 in subject s with IPF  
• To assess the immunogenicity of BG00011 in subject s with I PF

 • To assess the effect of BG00011 on biomarkers isolated from BAL and peripheral blood 
in subject s with IPF  
 
6. STUDY DESIGN 
This is a multi-center, randomized, double- blind, placebo-controlled, multiple dose, dose-
escalation study designed to evaluate the s afety, tolerability, PK, immunogenicity, and impact on 
BAL and peripheral blood biomarkers of BG00011 activity  in subject s with IPF  conducted at 
approximately 15 centers in North America.  
Approximately 40 subject s will be enrolled into 5 sequential ascend ing dose cohorts ( Table 1 ). 
Cohorts will include 8 subjects randomized to receive either BG00011 (6 subject s) or placebo (2  
subject s). Additional subjects may be enrolled if deemed appropriate by the  Data Safety 
Monitoring Board ( DSMB ).  Doses to be administered are as follows: 
Table 1: Dosing Cohorts  
Cohort                  Dose  Number of Subject s 
BG00011 Placebo  
1 0.015 mg/kg  6 2 
2 0.1 mg/kg  6 2 
3 0.3 mg/kg  6 2 
4 1.0 mg/kg  6 2 
5 3.0 mg/kg  6 2 
Total Number of Subject s 30 10 
 Subject s with clinical symptoms and features consistent with IPF prior to screening; forced vital 
capacity (FVC) ≥ 50% of predicted value;  carbon monoxide diffusion capacity, corrected for 
hemoglobin (DL
co/Hb) ≥ 30% of predi cted value; oxygen (O 2) saturation > 90% while breathing 
ambient air at rest  or receiving ≤2 L/minute of supplemental oxygen; residual volume (RV) ≤ 
120% of predicted value; a ratio of the forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1) to FVC ≥ 
0.65 after the use of a bronchodilator during screening pulmonary function tests (PFTs); high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) consistent with usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) pattern; and who meet the other inclusion/exclusion (I/E) criteria are eligible to enroll in the study. Subject s who do not qualify for study eligibility may be rescreened at the discretion of the 
Principal Investigator.  
Each subject  within a dose cohort will be randomized to receive either BG00011 or placebo and 
will participate in 2 cons ecutive study periods: 1) each subject will receive 8 consecutive weekly 
doses of BG00011 (or placebo) (Period 1; Multiple Dose [MD] phase); and, 2) each subject  will 
be monitored for 12 weeks (8 weeks for Cohorts 4 and 5) following administration of the last dose 
of study drug (Period 2; Follow- Up [FU] Phase).

 6.1 NOMENCLATURE FOR STUDY PERIODS AND STUDY DAYS  
Days for the  MD period are designated with an “MD” and days for the FU period are designated 
with an “FU.”  
• Day 1 -MD is the day the subject receives t he first dose during the MD period of the study. 
• Day 1 -FU is first day of the follow-up period, which should coincide with the day of last 
dose during the MD period (Day 50- MD).   
 
7. TREATMENT 
BG00011 will be administered as an SC injection. Doses will be 0.015 mg/kg, 0.1 mg/kg, 0.3 
mg/kg, 1.0 mg/kg, and 3.0 mg/kg. Weight obtained at initial screening will be used to calculate 
dose throughout the study.  At the end of a screening period, eligible subject s will return for 
dosing on Day 1-MD. Study drug will be administered once weekly for 8 doses (7 weeks), i.e., on 
Days 1 -MD, 8-MD, 15-MD, 22-MD, 29- MD, 36-MD, 43-MD, and 50- MD of the multiple -
doseperiod.  
In cohorts 1 to 3, each subject’s participation in the study will be for approximately 24 weeks 
(~5.5 months), i.e., up to 5 weeks to perform screening/entry evaluations, followed by 7 weeks of double-blind study dosing (8 doses) and a Follow-up period of 12 weeks.  For Cohorts 4 and 5,  the subject’s participation in the study will be for approximately 23 weeks (~5.5 months), i.e., up to 8 weeks to perform screening/entry evaluations, followed by 7 weeks of double-blind study dosing (8 doses) and Follow-up period of 8 weeks. 
 
8. SAMPLE SIZE JUSTIFIC ATION  
No formal statistical justification for the sample size was p erformed for this Phase 2a study. 
Cohort size was determined based on requirements for PK  analyses and safety  assessments. With 
6 subjects per cohort administered BG00011 the probability of observing an event is 82% if the 
actual probability of such an event is 25%. 
 
9. DEFINITION OF ANALYS IS POPULATIONS  
The “Safety” population will consist of all subject s who received at least one dose of BG00011 or 
placebo.

Final  V2.0 : 23May 2016                                                                                     Page 11 of 22 
 The “Pharmacodynamic”  population will consist of all subjects who received at least 1 multiple 
dose injection of BG00011 and have a corresponding sample collected for BAL and/or blood 
biomarkers (e.g., Visit 16 Day 8- FU).  
All protocol deviations that occur during the study will be considered for their severity/impact prior to treatment assignment unblindi ng and will be taken into consideration when subjects are 
assigned to analysis populations. Details of subject  assignment to the analysis populations will be 
listed.  
 
10. STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY  
10.1 General  
Data listings will be provided by treatment group, subject and visit, if applicable. Summary 
statistics and statistical analyses  will only be presented for data where detailed in this SAP. For 
continuous data, summary statistics will include the  arithmetic mean, arithmetic standard 
deviation (SD), median, minimum (Min) , max imum (Max)  and n; for log -normal data the 
geometric mean and geometric coefficient of variation (CV) will also be presented . For 
categorical data, frequency count and percentages will be presented. Data listings will be provided 
for all subject s up to the point of withdrawal, with any subjects excluded from the relevant 
population highlighted. Summary statistics and statistical analyses will generally only be 
performed for subjects included in the relevant analysis population. For the calculation of 
summary statistics and statistical analysis, unrounded data will be used.  
Due to the small number of subjects expected to enroll at each participating center, all summaries and analyses will be performed using data pooled across centers. Data for BG0 0011 treated 
subject s will be grouped by treatment group. Data for all placebo subjects, regardless of treatment 
group, will be treated as one group. Data will be summarized and presented by treatment group, defined as each of the BG00011 dose groups and t he combined placebo group. Data will be listed 
by treatment group. Exposure to study medication will be tabulated by treatment group.  
Mean change from baseline is the mean of all individual subject ’s change from  their  baseline 
value. Each individual change from baseline will be calculated by subtracting the individual 
subject’s baseline value from the value at their  subsequent visit(s). The individual subject ’s 
change from  baseline values will be used to calculate the mean change from baseline using a 
SAS
® procedure such as Proc Univariate.  
Data analys es will be performed using SAS® Version 9.1.3 or greater.  
As previously stated (Section 4), this document describes the planned analyses for this Phase 2a study evaluating the safety, tolerability, PK, immunog enicity, and impact on BAL and peripheral 
blood biomarker of multiple doses of BG00011 in subject s with IPF. Some of the analyses 
described in this SAP will be performed by outside vendors. These data will be imported to the Biometrics  database for study 203PF201 or, alternatively, provided as separate reports .

medical  history. 
10.4 Prior and Concomitant Medications  
Prior and concomitant medications will be listed in the by -subject  data listings. WHODRUG 
Version March 2011 or higher will be used  to encode these medications. 
10.5 Protocol Deviations 
Protocol deviations will be lis ted. 
10.6 Study Medication Administration 
Study medication administration will be listed and the frequency of subjects who were 
administered treatment at each of the 8 visits will be summarized.  
10.7 Pharmacokinetic Assessment  
The date and time of pharmacokinetic (PK) blood sample collection s by treatment group and by 
subject  will be listed.  The analysis  of PK data will be described in a separate PK analysis plan  and 
provided in a separate report.  
10.8 Safety and Tolerability Assessments  
Data will be summarized and presented by treatment group , defined as each of the BG00011 dose 
groups, the combined BG00011 group, and the combined placebo group. Dat a will be listed by 
treatment group. The safety population will be used for the following safety analyses. No 
inferential statistical analyses are planned.

 10.8.1 Adverse Events  
Adverse events (AEs) will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
(MedDRA Version 14.0 or later ). Summary tables will be based on treatment emergent AEs 
(TEAE) . A TEAE is defined as an AE that occurs during or after first dose or which is present 
prior to study drug administration  and becomes more severe during or after first dose. Any event 
occurring prior to the first dose of study medication will be recorded as medical history.  Related events are those classified as Possible, Probable, or Definite by the investigator.  All AE analyses will be performed on TEAEs. All TEAEs will be listed by subject . 
The following will be summarized and presented for each treatment group: 
• The total number of TEAEs for each treatment group overall, by highest severity, by 
strongest causal  relationship to study medication, the frequency of adverse events, the 
number of subject s with treatment emergent serious adverse events  (TESAEs ), and the 
number of subj ects with TEAEs leading to study discontinuation ;  
• The number and percentage of subjects experiencing a TEAE for each system organ class 
(SOC) and each preferred term (PT) within each SOC;  
• The number and percentage of subjects experiencing a TEAE for each  preferred term (PT) 
in descending frequency;  
• The number and percentage of subjects experiencing a TEAE by greatest severity for each 
system organ class (SOC) and each preferred term (PT) within each SOC;  
• The number and percentage of subjects experiencin g a related TEAE for each system organ 
class (SOC) and each preferred term (PT) within each SOC;  
• A listing  of subjects experiencing a TESAE;  
• A listing  of subjects experiencing a TEAE leading to withdrawal ; and  
• A listing of subject deaths occurring on study and relatedness to TEAE . 
The incidence of TEAEs will be calculated by dividing the number of subjects who have 
experienced the event by the number of subject s in the treatment group . Thus, the incidence of 
TEAEs counts only the first occurrence of an event for each subject  in that treatment group that 
experiences the event, and does not represent the total number of episodes of the particular event 
in the treatment group. If a subject  has repeated episodes of a particular TEAE, only the most 
severe episo de or the episode with the strongest causal relationship to study medication, as 
appropriate, will be counted. 
A subject with more than one TEAE for a particular PT will be counted only once in the total of 
subjects experiencing TEAEs in that particular PT .  Likewise, a subject  with more than one type 
of TEAE in a particular SOC will be counted only once in the total of subjects experiencing

 TEAEs in that particular SOC. Similarly, a subject who has experienced a TEAE in more than 
one SOC will be counted only once in the total number of subject s experiencing TEAEs in all 
SOCs .  
All occurrences of all TEAEs will be listed for each subject . In the listing of individual subject s

 10.8.3 Vital Signs 
Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize and present vital sign measurements at each 
nominal timepoint for each treatment group. Individual subject  listings of vital signs at each 
timepoint will also be provided by treatment group .  
10.8.4 Electrocardiogram (ECG)  
The ECG data will be obtained directly from the 12 -lead ECG traces . These data include the PR  
interval , QTcB interval, QRS duration, and heart rate. The ECG data will be listed by subject. 
Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize ECG measurements at each visit for each treatment group. In addition, a shift table of ECG interpretation results will be presented at each 
visit by treatment group . Individual subject listings of ECG parameters at each timepoint will also 
be provided by treatment group. 
10.8.5 Phys ical Examination 
Individual subject listings of physical examination results will be provided by treatment group.  
10.8.6 Pulmonary Function Tests  (PFT)  
Under Protocol Version 1, f or screening and b aseline PFTs, 3 PFTs will be performed on separate 
days during the screening period (within 5 weeks prior to dosing). The first of these tests will be performed before and after bronchodilator administration to determine if the subject  qualifies for 
the st udy, whereas the other 2 will be averaged to serve as the subject’s baseline value.  
Under Protocol Version 2 and later , for screening and baseline PFTs, 2 PFTs will be performed 
on separate days during the screening period (within 5 weeks prior to dosing) . The first of these 
tests will be performed before and after bronchodilator administration to determine if the subject qualifies for the study, whereas the other PFT  (performed without bronchodilator administration) 
will serve as the subject’s baseline value.  If the baseline PFT does not meet quality criteria, the 
pre-bronchodilator screening PFT (or repeat  pre-bronchodilator screening PFT, if appropriate) 
will be substituted as the baseline value.  
PFT parameters include:  
FVC:   forced (expiratory) vital capacity  
FEV
1:  forced expiratory volume over one second 
TLC:   total lung capacity  
DLco/Hb:carbon monoxide diffusion capacity, corrected for hemoglobin 
RV:  residual volume 
The assessment of changes in lung function during this study will be performed by comparing the 
subject ’s follow -up PFT parameters (i.e., Visit 9 Day 29-MD and Visit 16 Day 8- FU visits) to

 their baseline value. Each subject’s percent change from baseline will be calculated by subtracting 
the individual subject’s baseline value from the v alue at the desired time point and then dividing 
this calculated value by the individual subject ’s baseline value and multiplying by 100. The 
individual subject’s percent change from  the baseline value will be used to calculate the mean 
percent change from  baseline for the treatment group using a SAS procedure such as Proc 
Univariate.  
The following decreases in PFT parameters have been prospectively defined as  significant and 
may be clinically important: TLC ≥ 8% , FEV 1 ≥ 12%, FVC ≥ 12%, and/or DLco/Hb  ≥ 15% 
change from the baseline value. PFTs demonstrating a potentially clinically significant decline 
from baseline must be confirmed by repeating the abnormal parameter. A confirmed decline in a 
PFT parameter wi ll be reported as an adverse event and will be used for analysis purposes.  
Listings of individual subject  data by study visit and treatment assignment will be provided for 
each of the PFT parameters as well as the percent change from baseline. Summary statistics of the PFT parameters will be provided by treatment group for the actual PFT value and the percent predicted for each of the PFT parameters specified above (reference populations are NHANES III for Spirometry and Crapo 1982 for DL
co/Hb 3,4).  
10.8.7 Bronchoalveolar Lavage (BAL) MMP -12 
A BAL will be performed during the screening period and after receiving the last dose of study medication (i.e. , from Visit 14 Day 3- FU to Visit 16 Day 8 -FU). Analysis of the BAL 
macrophage MMP- 12 mRNA levels (which are increased when macrophages are activated) will 
be measured .  
Subject  listings of the screening and Visit 16 Day 8 -FU MMP -12 levels, as well as the % change 
from screening, will be provided. Summary statistics of the relative expression of MMP-12 levels at screening and following the last dose of study medication,  as well as  the percent change from 
Screening, will also be provided for each treatment group.  
10.8.8 High Resolution Computed Tomography (HRCT) 
The diagnostic criteria for IPF in study 203PF201 are based on the recently updated evidence-
based guidelines developed by the ATS/ERS/JRS/ALAT joint task force for the diagnosis and 
management of IPF
5. An HRCT scan will be performed during screening to establish subject  
eligibility as well as the pre -dosing pattern and extent of disease. Each subject  will have a repeat 
HRCT performed within 21 days after receiving the last dose of study medication to assess for changes in the extent of IPF. The details of the independent HRCT and surgical lung biopsy (SLB) assessments are described in the Perceptive Informatics ‘Independent Review Manual’.  
For the eligibility review, a minimum of 2 and a maximum of 3 independent radiologists will 
evaluate the screening HRCT images to determine whether they fulfil l the radiographic crite ria 
for UIP pattern. If a SLB is available at screening (lung biopsy performed prior to screening is 
acceptable), a minimum of 2 and a maximum of 3 independent pathologists will assess the SLB 
for UIP pattern. For all subjects that have a SLB available at the time of screening, the combined 
results of radiology and pathology assessments will be used to determine subject  eligibility. If a

 subject  does not have a SLB available at the time of screening, eligibility will be determined by 
radiology assessment al one. A consensus panel will be convened if subject eligibility is not clear 
based upon the initial independent review of the HRCT and SLB.  
For the safety review, the independent radiologists will also compare each subject’s screening and 
follow-up HRCT im ages to determine whether a change in IPF by HRCT has occurred. A 
qualitative  and semi -quantitative  assessment will be performed. The qualitative  assessment will 
summarize the change in the combination of honeycombing and reticulation (i.e., same, better, much better, worse, much worse, unknown). For the semi -quantitative  assessment, the extent of 
fibrosis including the extent of reticular abnormalities and honeycombing together will be scored for each lung separately as well as for both lungs combined using the following categories: absent, 1-25%, 26- 50%, 51-75%, 76-100%, or unknown. At the time of review the radiologists 
will also assess the HRCT images for technical adequacy and quality (i.e., noting anatomy that is not complete, motion artifacts present,  crucial anatomy is out of the f ield of view, other, etc.). 
Shift tables of the semi- quantitative HRCT assessments will be presented by treatment group. 
Individual subject listings of all HRCT and SLB eligibility assessments, as well as the qualitative and semi -quantitative HRCT safety assessments, will also be provided (including reviewer 
comments and consensus panel assessments). 
10.8.9 Pulse Oximetry  
Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize and present O
2 saturation at each visit, and 
change from baseli ne, for each treatment group. Individual subject  listings of O 2 saturation at 
each visit will be provided.  10.8.10 Immunogenicity (Anti -BG00011 Antibodies)  
Blood samples for potential antibodies to BG00011 will be collected during screening and prior to 
dosing on Visit 2 Day 1 -MD. Post-dose samples will be obtained on Visit 19 Day 29-FU and 
Visit 85 Day 85- FU. 
Each blood sample will initially be tested for the presence of anti-BG00011 antibodies using a validated electrochemiluminescence (ECL) method . Confirmed positive samples using the 
screening assay will be titered and subsequently tested using a validated neutralization assay. 
Antibody results will be presented by treatment group and subject in listings. The incidence of 
antibodies to BG00011 (both binding as well as neutralizing)  will be tabulated over time by 
treatment group using descriptive statistics . The antibody titer and natural log transformed results 
will be summarized and  presented using descriptive statistics . If antibodies are present, their 
effec t on PK parameters will be explored.  
10.8.11  Investigator Assessment of Respiratory Status 
For subjects in Cohorts 4 & 5 , a listing will be created of the investigator’s assessment of the 
subject’s respiratory status relative to baseline (better, worse, or the same) at Day 57 -FU.

 10.8.12  Other Assessments  
All other safety assessments not detailed in this section will be listed but not summarized or 
statistically analyzed.  
10.9 Data Safety Monitoring Board 
An independent DSMB experienced in the oversight and monitoring of the conduct of clinical trials will determine whether dose escalation should proceed. The DSMB will be comprised of a biostatistician and two pulmonologists with expertise in interstitial lung diseases. The DSMB members’ responsibilities and the process for data reviews and dose- escalation are described in 
the DSMB Charter.  
Dose escalation will be based on the DSMB’s review of unblinded PK and safety data through Day 15 from the initial 4 (of 8) subject s administered BG00011 or placebo (3:1, respectively) in 
each cohort. Safety assessments will include a review of AEs, vital signs, physical examination, clinical laboratory tests, and pulse oximetry from these visits. In order to allow for compilation and evaluation of the data, it is anticipated that the DSMB will convene approximately 9-10 
weeks after the first 4 subject s in the previous cohort are initially dosed.  
Serious adverse events will be provided to the DSMB on an ongoing basis throughout the study. Updated safety (including BAL, PFTs, and HRCT results) and PK information on all participants will be provided in each subsequent DSMB data package. For example, at the DSMB meetings for Cohorts 2 and 3, updated safety and PK data will be available through at least week 8 of the follow-up period (i.e., complete PK data through the dosing phase and follow-up BAL, PFT, and HRCT) for all participants in Cohorts 1 and 2, respectively.  
10.10 Pharmacodynamic Analyses 
Secondary objectives of this study are to assess the effect of BG00011 on biomarkers isolated 
from BAL  and peripheral blood in subject s with IP F. Listings and summary tables of expression 
level of 7 prespecified genes (Table 2) will be provided by treatment group and visit. A listing 
and summary table of ratio of pSMAD2 to tSMAD2 levels will be provided by treatment group and visit. Additional analyses of gene expression data from serum or BAL may be provided in a 
separate report.

TREM1 ( triggering receptor exp ressed 
on myeloid cells 1) Amplifies monocyte /macrophage - and neutrophil - 
mediated  toll- like receptor  inflammatory  responses 
by stimulating release of pro -inflammatory 
chemokines and cytokines. Elevated soluble serum TREM 1 levels are negatively correlated with 
pulmonary function in scleroderma  subject s. 
 
11. INTERIM ANALYSES  
No formal interim statistical analyses are planned.  An administrative  interim analysis of data 
collected on Cohorts 1-4 may be used for internal (Biogen) decision making. 
12. CHANGES FROM THE PROTOCOL SPECIFIED STATISTICAL ANALYSES   
There were no changes from the protocol specified statistical analyses.  
13. CHANGES FROM THE PREVIOUS STATISTICAL  ANALYSIS PLAN 
Several changes were made to SAP version 2.0 that differed from the SAP version 1.0.  All 
changes to the SAP were finalized prior to database lock and unblinding. In addition to editorial 
updates, the following c hanges were made:

 • A test for trend analysis will not be performed to assess the relationship between dose level 
and incidence of antibodies due to small sample sizes.  
• Many of the efficacy analyses described in Section 10.8 of SAP version 1.0 will not be 
performed under this SAP.  Additional analyses of gene expression data from serum or 
BAL will be provided in a separate report.  ETS1 and  tSMAD2 were added as biomarkers 
to analyze.  
• The “Efficacy” analysis population was renamed to the “Pharmacodynamic” population to 
more accurately reflect its purpose.  Also, only 1 injection of BG00011 will be necessary 
for part of the requirement to be included in this population, rather than the 5 injections noted in SAP version 1.0. 
• The PK methods and analysis will be described in a separate PK analysis plan .

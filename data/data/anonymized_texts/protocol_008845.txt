 Characterization of Tavilermide  
Tavilermide (previously designated by its laboratory name, MIM -D3) ophthalmic 
solution  is a proteolytically stable, cyclic peptidomimetic that mimics a β -turn region of 
nerve growth factor ( NGF ) formulated as a preservative -free, aqueous, sterile ophthalmic 
solution . Biochemical and cellular assays showed  that tavilermide  is a partial 
tropomyos in-related kinase A (TrkA) receptor agonist, activating and potentiating  the 
effects of suboptimal concentrations of the natural ligand NGF ,1 and acts synergistically 
with NGF in vivo .2–4 Tavilermide  is a new chemical entity.  
Mimetogen Pharmaceuticals USA,  Inc. (Sponsor) is developing  tavilermide  as a potential 
therapeutic agent for the treatment of dry eye disease (DED).  
 Summary of the Nonclinical Program  
Nonclinical data have demonstrated that tavilermide has physiologic effects that lead to 
amelioration of the signs associated with dry eye5 without causing any significant ocular, 
systemic, genotoxic, embryo -fetal development or safety concerns related to any organ 
system.  
Intravenous  toxicity studies in rats and dogs (28 days) revealed no adverse findings  and 
no target organ toxicity for doses up to 150 and 40 mg/kg tavilermide, respectively. No 
evidence of mutagenicity or genotoxicity was observed, nor were any significant effects 
noted on the central nervous system, respiratory system or cardiovascular s ystem.  
Repeat -dose ocular toxicity studies of up to 6 -months duration were conducted in rabbits 
at concentrations up to 5% administered topically four times per day (QID) . No test 
article -related morbidity/mortality was noted , and no test article -related o cular effects 
were observed macroscopically or microscopically.  No marked or significant 
toxicological effects were noted in any organ system, and the product did not accumulate 
in the body after repeated topical ocular instillations . No significant gender -related effects 
were noted for tavilermide.  
In an e mbryo -fetal development study  in rats, a slight reduction in maternal body weight 
gain was apparent at the high dose (350 mg/kg). There was no evidence of effects on fetal 
growth and embryo -fetal mortalit y. Fetal abnormalities noted at 100 and 350 mg/kg did 
not indicate a clear effect of tavilermide. The no-observed -adverse -effect -level (NOAEL ) 
for maternal toxicity was considered to be 350 mg/kg/day and for embryo -fetal 
development was considered to be 35  mg/kg/day. In a rabbit e mbryo -fetal development 
study, there were no effects on embryo -fetal growth or dysmorphol ogy (teratogenicity) or 
embryo -fetal mortality at the highest dose. The NOAEL for maternal toxicity and 
embryo -fetal development was considere d to be 200 mg/kg/day.

 Summary of the Clinical Program  
To date, one Phase 2 and three Phase 3 multicenter, randomized, double -masked, vehicle -
controlled studies conducted in adult subjects with dry eye disease in the U.S. of similar 
design  are completed. T he Phase 2 study was 7 weeks in duration, whereas the Phase 3 
studies were 10 weeks. There was a one -week open -label  run-in with Bausch & Lomb 
Sensitive Eyes® Drops followed by a 4 -week and 8 -week treatment period in the Phase  2 
and Phase 3 studies, respec tively. The Phase 2 study also had a 2 -week follow up  after 
treatment cessation . Treatment in each study was administered as a single drop twice 
daily ( morning and evening ) in each eye. These previous studies used the Controlled 
Adverse Environment® (CAE®) model both for screening and efficacy endpoints.  
In the Phase 2 study  (MIM -724), 150 subjects with dry eye were randomized to 1%  
tavilermide ophthalmic solution , 5% tavilermide ophthalmic solution,  or placebo 
ophthalmic solution  (i.e., vehicle of tavilerm ide ophthalmic solution) . The 1% and 5% 
tavilermide ophthalmic solution s were numerically superior to placebo in reducing the 
signs and symptoms of dry eye, but not for the study pre -specified primary efficacy 
endpoints.6 Post hoc analyses  suggested that t he greatest treatment effect was observed 
with the 1% tavilermide ophthalmic solution. Therefore, 1% tavilermide ophthalmic 
solution was chosen for  further investigation in  Phase  3 studies.  
In each of the three Phase 3 studies (MIM -725, MIM -726, and MIM -727), 400 subjects 
with dry eye were randomized to 1% tavilermide ophthalmic solution or placebo 
ophthalmic solution . 1% tavilermide ophthalmic solution was numerically superior to 
placebo in reducing the signs and symptoms of dry eye, but not for the study pre-
specified primary efficacy endpoints . 
 Summary of Known and Potential Risks and Benefits  
In the Phase 2  study (MIM -724), which  investigated the 1% and 5% concentrations of 
tavilermide  versus placebo, there were no deaths or serious ocular treatment emer gent 
adverse events (TEAEs). The total TEAEs reported during the study were distributed 
fairly evenly among the treatment groups : 1% tavilermide had 22 TEAEs , 5% tavilermide 
had 35, and placebo had 30. Furthermore , ocular TEAEs also were distributed somewh at 
evenly  among the treatment groups: 1% tavilermide had 10 TEAEs,  5% tavilermide had 
8, and placebo had 8. The majority of the ocular TEAEs were mild. Ophthalmic 
examinations  yielded no concerns . The MIM -724 trial suggested that the tavilermide 
ophthalmic  solutions , both 1% and 5%, are  safe and well -tolerated.  
In the Phase 3 studies, no deaths or serious ocular TEAEs occurred ; TEAEs occurred in 
less than 5% of subjects.  No clinically significant  (CS)  safety findings were observed by 
intraocular pressure ( IOP) measurement , slit-lamp biomicroscopy, or dilated fundoscopy , 
and there were no changes in safety parameters due to the tavilermide or vehicle 
treatments.  All abnormal findings  reported at baseline  were considered not clinically 
significant  (NCS) .

Clinical Trial Protocol: MIM -728 FINAL  Version 2.0 03Jul2019  
 
CONFIDENTIAL   Page 19 of 70 1% ta vilermide ophthalmic solution was well tolerated,  and there was no difference in 
the comfort of 1% tavilermide ophthalmic solution compared to placebo , as reported  by 
subjects . 
Results from the previous Phase 2 and Phase 3 trials suggest that tavilermide o phthalmic 
solution is a promising new treatment for DED  with an acceptable safety profile . 
 Dose Selection and Study Rationale  
Tavilermide ophthalmic solution is to be administered as a single drop , bilaterally  (i.e., 
both eyes) , and twice daily ( morning an d evening ). The previous  Phase  3 studies were 
performed with 1% tavilermide for 8 weeks  and did not meet the pre -specified primary 
endpoints. Consequently, this trial is powered to study the efficacy of 5% tavilermide 
with a longer treatment period of 12 w eeks, while simultaneously continuing to examine 
1% tavilermide.  
 Compliance Statement  
This study will be conducted in compliance with the protocol, current Good Clinical 
Practices (GCPs), including the International Conference on Harmoni sation (ICH) 
Guidel ines, and in general, consistent with the Declaration of Helsinki. In addition, all 
applicable local, state, and federal requirements relevant to the use of investigational  
product ( IP) in the countries involved will be adhered to.  
 Intended Study Populatio n 
The population for this study will be patients with moderate DED  who are at least 18 
years of age and of any gender and race who satisfy all of the inclusion criteria and meet 
none of the exclusion criteria outlined  in this protocol . 
3 STUDY  OBJECTIVES  
 Primary Objective  
To compare the efficacy and safety of 5% tavilermide ophthalmic solution to placebo for 
the treatment of the symptoms  and signs of DED . 
 Secondary Objective

CONFIDENTIAL   Page 20 of 70 4 STUDY DESIGN  
 Type of Study  
This Phase 3 trial is a multi -center, double -masked, randomized, vehicle -controlled, 
parallel -group clinical study. There will be two active treatment groups – 1% tavilermide 
ophthalmic solution and 5% tavilermide ophthalmic solution  – and one control group  – 
placebo ophthalmic solution (vehicle of tavilermide ophthalmic solution).  
Figure 1 (Page 21) provides an outline of the study assessments and phases o f the trial.  
A subject’s participation is to start with screening and baseline safety measurements at 
Visit 1. If the subject is considered eligible for the study at the end of Visit 1, the subject 
will participate in a 14 -day run -in period. Isotonic ophth almic solution – also known as 
placebo ophthalmic solution (vehicle of tavilermide ophthalmic solution)  – is the 
designated run -in and is to be administered to both eyes (OU) , topically (TOP) , and twice 
per day (BID) throughout the run -in period.  
Baseline efficacy measurements are to be obtained at Visit 2. Should a subject qualify for 
final study entry at the end of Visit 2, they are to be randomly assigned to one of three 
treatment groups:  
 5% tavilermide ophthalmic solution , 
 1% tavilermide ophthalmic solu tion, or 
 Placebo ophthalmic solution . 
During the treatment period, the subject is to dose with their assigned treatment OU , 
TOP , and BID for approximately 85 days.  
 Number of Subjects  
Approximately 1034 subjects are to be screened to enroll approximately 60 0 subjects . A 
maximum of 40 subjects will be enrolled at each of 15 to 20 sites in the United States . 
 Expected Duration of Study  
The duration of an individual’s participation in the study, from the start of subject 
screening to study exit, is six clinic vi sits over approximately  100 days (i.e., about 14 
weeks).  
The duration of the study – from first patient, first visit to last patient, last visit – is 
expected to be approximately 10 months .

CONFIDENTIAL   Page 24 of 70 5 STUDY TREATMENTS  
 Description and Labelling of Investigational Product  
5.1.1 Study Treatment Formula tion 
The trial has three investigational products:  
 5% tavilermide ophthalmic solution  (10 mg/day total dose) , 
 1% tavilermide ophthalmic solution  (2 mg/day total dose) , and  
 Placebo ophthalmic solution (vehicle of tavilermide ophthalmic solution).  
The active  ingredient in the 5% and 1% tavilermide ophthalmic solutions is tavilermide 
hydrochloride  salt. The vehicle for  tavilermide is a sterile, preservative -free, buffered, 
isotonic solution for topical administration . Tavilermide ophthalmic solution  contains 
drug substance and pharmaceutically acceptable excipients commonly used in ophthalmic 
solutions . The manufacturer of the IP is Holopack Verpackungstechnik GmbH , which has 
a place of business at Bahnhofstraße 20, 73453 Abtsgmünd, Germany . 
The IP is contained  in sterile, single -use, low -density polyethylene (LDPE) vials (0.3 
mL/vial). A card of five vials of the same formulation is sealed in a foil pouch. Eight foil 
pouches containing vials of the same formulation are packaged into a box to make one 
clinical k it. One clinical kit is sufficient for 14 days of dosing with an additional 12 extra 
vials. All IP is labeled according to applicable regulatory requirements.  
IP for the treatment phase of the study is labeled as “Tavilermide Ophthalmic Solution or 
Placebo  Ophthalmic Solution.” Kit packaging and labeling, except for an identifier, are 
identical for each of the three treatment arms. Treatment kits are identifiable by a unique, 
five-digit kit number. Kit numbers are randomly associated with clinical kits from  the 
three treatment arms and range from 30001 to 36600 . 
The IP for the three arms are visually distinct. The discrepancies in appearance mandate 
that there is at least one technician designated as unmasked at each clinical site. Once 
open, a treatment kit  is to be handled by only the subject to which it was assigned and 
unmasked designees.  
5.1.2 Run-In Formulation  
The run -in is the placebo ophthalmic solution. The run-in is packaged in the same manner 
as randomized treatment kits.  
IP for the run -in phase of the study is labeled “ Isotonic Ophthalmic Solution .” Run -in kits 
are identifiable by a unique, four -digit kit number. Run -in kit numbers range from 1001 
to 3880 . 
Subjects are not to be made aware that the run -in is the placebo ophthalmic solution 
because the p lacebo is visually distinct from the active treatments. Should a subject note 
an appearance change from the run -in phase to the treatment phase,  and be aware that the 
placebo ophthalmic solution is the IP for the run -in phase and one of the three 
randomize d treatment arms, they may infer that they were assigned to one of the active 
Tavilermide Ophthalmic Solution  Mimetogen Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc.  
Clinical Trial Protocol: MIM -728 FINAL  Version 2.0 03Jul2019  
 
CONFIDENTIAL   Page 25 of 70 treatments. Therefore, IP for the run -in phase is to be labeled as “ Isotonic Ophthalmic 
Solution ” so as to mask from the subjects that the run -in is the placebo ophthalmic 
soluti on. 
 Dosage and Route of Administration  
5.2.1 Run-In Period  
For the run -in phase of the trial, subjects  qualified at the end of Visit 1 to continue to 
Visit 2  are to administer 1 drop  (GTT)  of isotonic ophthalmic solution  (i.e., placebo 
ophthalmic solution) OU, T OP, and BID  – morning and evening before bed – for 
approximately 14 days. The first dose of run -in is to be in the evening before bed on the 
day of Visit 1. The last dose of run -in is to be in the evening before bed on the day before 
Visit 2.  
The subject i s not to dose  with run -in on the day of Visit 2 before their appointment. 
Should a subject dose with run-in on the day of Visit 2  before their appointment , the time 
of the dose is to be recorded, and the subject should wait at least 4 hours from the time o f 
the dose to the start time of any efficacy assessments.  
The subject is to return their run -in kit, including used and unused vials at Visit 2.  
5.2.2 Treatment Period  
At the end of Visit 2, enrolled subjects are to be randomly assigned one of the three IPs to 
use during the treatment phase of the trial (i.e., Visit 2 to Visit 6).  During the treatment  
phase , subjects are to administer  1 GTT  of their assigned treatment  OU, TOP , and  BID – 
morning and evening before bed – for approximately 85 days.  The first dose of  the 
assigned treatment is to be in the office at Visit 2. The first at -home dose is to be in the 
evening before bed on the day of Visit 2. The last dose is to be in the evening before bed 
on the day before Visit 6.  
On the days of Visits 3, 4, 5, and 6 , subjects are not to dose  with IP before their 
appointments. Should a subject dose with IP on the day of a visit before their 
appointment, the time of the dose is to be recorded, and the subject should wait at least 4 
hours from the time of the dose to the st art time of any efficacy assessments.  
Subjects are to self-administer an in -office dose of their assigned treatment at Visits 2 and 
5. After Visits 2 and 5 , subjects  are to take their next dose of IP in the evening before 
bed. Subjects will not dose in -office at Visits 3 and 4 . After Visits 3 and 4 , subjects are to  
resume dosing at home immediately following the visit  and take a second dose in the 
evening before bed . 
Subjects are to return each kit, used and unused vials, the visit after which it was 
origin ally assigned. Used vials are to be returned to the site in a resealable, opaque bag. 
The bag and the unused vials should be kept in the closed kit box. Furthermore, subjects 
are to be instructed not to show their drops to, or discuss the drops with, clini cal trial staff  
– unless specifically told otherwise  – or other subjects.  
Escape medications and special diet or activities are not applicable.

CONFIDENTIAL   Page 26 of 70 The follow -up period for the IP in the run -in and treatment phases ends with the subject’s  
exit from the study. Adverse Events ( AEs) ongoing at the end of Visit 6 are to be 
followed as specified in Section 9.5. 
 Storage and Dispensation of Investigational Product  
The IP must be stored in a secure area accessible only to the Investigator  and his/her 
designees. The IP will be administered only to subjects entered into the clinical study, in 
accordance with the conditions specified in this protocol.  
IP is to be stored at 15 -25 °C and protected from light; IP is never to be frozen or 
refrigera ted. 
Subjects are to be instructed on the proper use and storage of the IP at the end of each 
visit at which IP is dispensed. Written instructions detailing the proper use and storage of 
the IP are also to be provided to the subjects.  
Kits are to be dispen sed in their entirety to the appropriate subjects. At Visit 1, each 
eligible subject is to receive one run -in kit. Run -in kits should be assigned in sequential 
order to subjects as they become eligible from the list of available kits at the site.  
At Visits  2 and 3, each eligible subject is to receive one kit of their randomly assigned 
treatment. At Visits 4 and 5, each  eligible  subject is to receive two kits of their randomly 
assigned treatment. Randomized treatment kits are to be assigned by the Interactiv e 
Response Technology ( IRT) system. Subjects are to return all used vials and unused IP at 
the visit after the one at which the IP was originally dispensed.  
Replacement kits are available as needed for dispensation. Replacement kits are to be 
assigned usin g the IRT system after receiving approval from Ora and the Sponsor.  
 Investigational Product Accountability  
The IP is only to  be prescribed by the Principal Investigator  or his/her named Sub-
Investigator(s ) and is only to  be used in accordance with this pro tocol. The IP must only 
be distributed to subjects properly qualified under this protocol to receive IP. 
The Investigator  must keep an accurate record and accounting of the IP on site received 
from the supplier , including dates of receipt . In addition, acc urate records will be kept 
regarding the amount of IP dispensed to subjects, amount of IP returned to the 
Investigator  by the subjects, and the amount returned or disposed upon the completion of 
the study. A detailed inventory must be completed for the IP, and reasons for departure 
from the expected dispensing regimen will be recorded.  
At the end of the study, there will be a final reconciliation of unused investigational 
product that was returned to the site by subject s or was not dispensed by the site. Th ere is 
to be no reconciliation of used or missing vials.  Any discrepancies will be investigated, 
resolved and documented by the study team. All IP, used and unused,  will be returned to 
the Sponsor  or their designee in compliance with applicable regulations . The return of IP 
will be specified in writing.

 Subject Compliance with Protocol  
The compliance and accountability guidelines  below  are to be used by the Investigator 
for determining subject compliance with this protocol and for recording deviations from 
the stated  compliance. The site -calculated dosing compliance is not to be transcribed to 
the electronic Case Report Forms ( eCRFs ). 
Run-in is to be collected at Visit 2. A technician is to calculate dosing compliance from 
Visit 1 to Visit 2 by dividing the number of used vials by the number of expected doses 
and  
 
 
 
 Non-compliance with dosing during the run -in phase may be 
grounds for screen failure at Visit 2 as determined by the Investigator  (Section 6.2, 
Exclusion s ). 
Randomized treatment is to be collected at Visits 3, 4, 5, and 6. At each of these visits, 
the subject compliance with dosing from the previous visi t is to be calculated. At Visits 3 
and 6, the in -office doses at Visits 2 and 5 will be included in the expected vial count  for 
the purpose of site -calculated dosing compliance , respectively.  
 
 
 
 
 Prohibited Medicati ons/Treatments  
Disallowed medications and treatments during the study and applicable washout periods 
are outlined in the Exclusion Criteria (Section  6.2). In addition, the site is responsible for 
reviewing subject -reported concom itant medications for prohibited treatments such as 
medications with  ocular drying effects, antihistamines, mast cell stabilizers, 
corticosteroids, or other exclusionary medications.  
Concurrent enrollment in another investigational drug or medical device s tudy is not 
permitted.  
5.6.1 Concomitant Medications  
The use of any concomitant  medication, prescription or over -the-counter, is to be 
recorded on the subject’s source document and corresponding eCRF along with the 
reason the medication was taken.  
Common medicat ions that may be permissible for use as needed by trial subjects for pain 
relief or the treatment of a cold or flu during the study are outlined below . The site is 
responsible for reviewing any medication taken by the subject for compliance with the 
disall owed medications as listed in the Exclusion Criteria ( Section 6.2).

6 SUBJECT ENROLLMENT AND RANDOMIZATION  
Before  performing any study -specific procedure  – including screening procedures to 
determine eligibility  – a signed informed consent form  (ICF)  will be obtained for each 
subject. The consent form will describe the purpose of the study, the procedures to be 
perfo rmed , and the risks and potential benefits of participation. The Investigator  or an 
appropriately trained and delegated staff member is to  conduct the informed consent 
discussion , check that the subject comprehend s the information provided , and answer any 
questions about the study. The subject and the individual  that conducted the consent 
discussion are to  sign the ICF. A copy of the consent form is to be given to the subject 
and consent is to be documented on the subject’s record.

CONFIDENTIAL   Page 29 of 70 Each subject who signs an ICF is to be assigned a screening number. All screening 
numbers are to be assigned in strict numerical sequence at each site , and no numbers are 
to be skipped or omitted. The first screening number at each site is to be 001. A unique, 
two-digit, numeric i dentifier is to be assigned to each site (e.g., 70). The site number and 
the screening number are to be concatenated to create a unique subject identifier (e.g., 70-
001).  
Qualified subjects are to be assigned to a randomized study treatment only if they me et 
all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria.

 Randomi zation Procedures  
A patient who  meets all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria is 
eligible for randomization at Visit 2. Subjects are to be randomized to one of three 
treatment arms:  
1) 5% tavilermide ophthalmic solution , 
2) 1% tavilermide ophthalmic solution , or 
3) Placebo ophthalmic solution.  
A statistician not directly involved in the analysis of the study results will prepare the 
randomization schedule using block randomization to maintain balance  between 
treatment arms. Randomization is to be done in a  respectively , by the IRT 
system.  
Subjects are to be stratified by site and EDS as measured by the VAS at Visit 2 using the 
following strata : 
  
  
Details required for stratification are to be entered into the IRT which will randomize the 
subject and assign a randomization number. Randomization numbers are to be four digits 
and will allow for the identification of a subject’s treatment arm. The IRT is also to be 
used to assign treatment kits ; each treatment kit is identifiable by a five-digit kit number .

CONFIDENTIAL   Page 33 of 70 The randomization number and all treatment kit numbers are to be recorded on the 
subject’s source document and the appropriate eCRFs.  
 Arrangemen ts Taken to Prevent Unmasking  
All subjects, investigators, and study personnel involved with the conduct of the study 
will be masked with regard to treatment assignments.  
Randomization is to be accomplished by IRT. A dedicated IRT manager is to be 
responsi ble for overseeing the IRT system including randomization and treatment kit 
assignment.  
The discrepancies in visual appearance among the IP mandate that there is at least one 
technician designated as unmasked at each clinical site. Once open, a treatment k it is to 
be handled by only the subject to which it was assigned and unmasked designees.  
Unmasked technic ians are uniquely delegated for facilitating the in -office dose and drop 
comfort assessments and performing randomized treatment kit accountability. Unmasked 
technicians may not participate in any other aspect of the trial that has a bearing on trial 
efficacy including symptom questionnaires, scribing for the Investigator , and data 
transcription. Unmasked technicians are not to have access to the electro nic data capture 
(EDC) system. Clinical trial monitors who are designated as unmasked are to be 
responsible for reviewing randomized IP accountability . After unmasking, a clinical trial 
monitor is not to participate in other aspects of trial monitoring.  
 Procedures for Unmasking  
When medically necessary, the Investigator  may need to determine what treatment has 
been assigned to a subject. When possible (i.e., in non -emergent situations), Ora and/or 
the Sponsor  should be notified before unmasking IP.  
If the Investigator  identifies a medical need for unmasking the assigned treatment of a 
subject, they should, if possible, contact Ora and/or the Medical Monitor  before 
completing the unmasking. Ora is to ask the site to complete the appropriate parts of the 
Unmas king Request Form and then to return the form . After receiving the form, Ora is to 
notify Mimetogen, and jointly they are to determine whether to approve the unmasking; 
Ora or Mimetogen may consult with the Medical Monitor  as needed during this process. 
The result of the request is to be documented on the Unmasking Request Form.  
If the request to unmask a subject is approved, the Investigator  is to be provided the 
approval in writing via the Unmasking Request Form. The Investigator  is to unmask the 
subject using the IRT and complete the Unmasking Memo. The Unmasking Memo is to 
be filed with the subject’s study file, and a copy is to be sent to project management so 
that it may be included in the Trial Master File (TMF). For each unmasking request, the 
reason  for the request, the date of the request, and the name and signature of the 
individual unmasking the subject are to be noted in the subject’s study file.

 Early Termination  
6.6.1 Reasons for Discontinuation  
Subjects may be discontinued  by the Investigator, Spons or, or Medical Monitor  prior to 
their completion of the study due to : 
 AEs, 
 Protocol violations,  
 Administrative reasons (e.g., inability to continue due to scheduling , lost to 
follow -up), 
 Sponsor termination of study , or 
 Other.  
If at any time , the Investiga tor determines that a subject’s safety has been compromised, 
the Investigator may discontinue the subject from the study treatment. The Investigator, 
Sponsor, or Medical Monitor may discontinue any subject for any valid medical reason or 
non-compliance.  
Ora, the Sponsor, or the Investigator may terminate the trial at any time with appropriate 
notification.  
6.6.2 Reasons for Withdrawal  
Subjects may choose to end their participation in the study at any time by withdrawing 
consent  (i.e., subject choice) . 
6.6.3 Documenting  Early Termination and Subjects Lost to Follow -Up  
The site is to notify Ora of any subject discontinuation or withdrawal and the reason. The 
discontinuation or withdrawal and the reason are to be clearly documented in the subject 
source and eCRF.  
If a sub ject is discontinued or withdraws from the study before Visit 6, all safety and 
efficacy evaluations performed at Visit 6 are to be done on the day of discontinuation or 
at the discretion of the Investigator . Sites are to use the Visit 6 section of the sou rce 
document to record an early termination visit.  
Any subject who is discontinued or withdraws is to be instructed to return all IP to the 
clinic for accountability.  
Subjects who are discontinued or withdraw from the study are not to be replaced.  
Follow -up for subjects who end treatment with IP is to be performed at the Investigator’s 
discretion. Any AEs that are ongoing as of withdrawal or discontinuation are to be 
followed as outlined in Section 9.5. 
In the case that the site  is unable to contact a subject, the site is to make two documented 
phone calls to the subject and send a certified letter before deeming the subject lost to 
follow -up.

9 ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY  
AEs (both elicited and  observed) will be monitored throughout the study. All AEs (both 
elicited and observed) will be promptly reviewed by the Investigator  for accuracy and 
completeness. All AEs will be documented on the appropriate  source document pages 
and eCRF .

Clinical Trial Protocol: MIM -728 FINAL  Version 2.0 03Jul2019  
 
CONFIDENTIAL   Page 39 of 70 necessitates surgical intervention is to be considered an adverse eve nt if the occurrence or 
detection of the condition is temporally associated with the use of study  drug.  
The worsening of a medical condition that was present before the administration of study 
drug is to be considered a new adverse event and reported as su ch. The improvement or 
lack of change of a medical condition that was present before the administration of study 
drug is not to be recorded as a TEAE  at subsequent visits unless it worsens during 
treatment.  
The worsening of DED is to be considered an adver se event only if the exacerbation of 
the signs or symptoms exceed what the subject has previously experienced. The 
determination to record worsening of DED as an AE is to be made by the Investigator  
and the subject.  
Study drug includes the IP under evaluat ion, any comparator drug, the vehicle, and any 
other medications required by the protocol given during any stage of the study.  
Therefore, AE reporting begin s with the administration of the topical , local  anesthetic 
used to measure IOP  at Visit 1.  
9.2.1 Severity  
Severity  of an AE is defined as a qualitative assessment of the degree of intensity of an 
AE as determined by the Investigator  or reported to him/her by the subject. The 
assessment of severity is made irrespective of relationship to IP or seriousness of th e 
event and should be evaluated according to the following scale:  
 Mild : Event is noticeable to the subject, but is easily tolerated and does not interfere 
with the subject’s daily activities.  
 Moderate : Event is bothersome, possibly requiring additional the rapy, and may 
interfere with the subject’s daily activities.  
 Severe : Event is intolerable, necessitates additional therapy or alteration of therapy, 
and interferes with the subject’s daily activities.  
9.2.2 Relationship to Investigational Product  
The relationshi p of each AE to the IP should be determined by the Investigator  using 
these explanations:  
 Suspected : A reasonable possibility exists that the IP caused the AE. A suspected 
AE can be further defined as:  
 Definite : Relationship exists when the AE follows a re asonable sequence from 
the time of IP administration, follows a known response pattern of the drug 
class, is confirmed by improvement on stopping the IP and no other 
reasonable cause exists.  
 Probable : Relationship exists when the AE follows a reasonable se quence 
from the time of IP administration, follows a known response pattern of the 
drug class, is confirmed by improvement on stopping the IP and the suspect IP 
is the most likely of all causes.  
Tavilermide Ophthalmic Solution  Mimetogen Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc.  
Clinical Trial Protocol: MIM -728 FINAL  Version 2.0 03Jul2019  
 
CONFIDENTIAL   Page 40 of 70  Possible : Relationship exists when the AE follows a reasonabl e sequence 
from the time of IP administration, but could also have been produced by the 
subject’s clinical state or by other drugs administered to the subject.  
 Not Suspected:  A reasonable possibility does not exist that the IP caused the AE. 
 Not Related:  Concurrent illness, concurrent medication, or other known cause 
is clearly responsible for the AE, the administration of the IP and the 
occurrence of the AE are not reasonably related in time, OR exposure to IP 
has not occurred.  
9.2.3 Expectedness  
The expectednes s of an AE should be determined based upon existing safety information 
about the IP using these explanations:  
 Unexpected: An AE that is not listed in the Investigator’s Brochure (IB) or is not 
listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed.  
 Expected :  An AE that is listed in the IB at the specificity and severity that has been 
observed.  
 Not applicable: An AE unrelated to the IP.  
AEs that are mentioned in the IB as occurring with a class of products or as anticipated 
from the pharmacological/me chanical (or other) properties of the product, but are not 
specifically mentioned as occurring with the particular product under investigation are to 
be considered unexpected.  
The Investigator  should initially classify the expectedness of an AE, but the fi nal 
classification is subject to the Medical Monitor’s determination.  
9.2.4 Action Taken with Investigational Product  
If an AE occurs and the Investigator alters the IP dose or administration in any way, this 
should be documented in the source document and repor ted in the eCRF.  
Available options within the eCRF for reporting actions taken with the IP due to an AE 
include:  
 Dose  Not Changed  
 Drug Interrupted  
 Drug Withdrawn  
 Not Applicable (if subject  has not been exposed to IP)  
9.2.5 Outcome  
The outcome of an AE should be documented in the source document and in the eCRF 
using the following categories:  
 Fatal  
 Not Recovered/Not Resolved  
Tavilermide Ophthalmic Solution  Mimetogen Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc.

 Recovering/Resolving  
 Unknown  
 Serious Adverse Events  
An AE is considered serious if, in th e view of either the Investigator  or Sponsor , it results 
in any of the following outcomes:  
 Death;  
 A life -threatening AE; 
Note: An AE is considered “life -threatening” if, in the view of either the Investigator  or 
Sponsor , its occurrence places the subject a t immediate risk of death. It does not include 
an AE that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.  
 Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization;  
Note: The term “inpatient hospitalization” refers to any inpat ient admission (even if less 
than 24 hours). For chronic or long -term inpatients, inpatient admission includes transfer 
within the hospital to an acute/intensive care inpatient unit. Inpatient hospitalization does 
not include: emergency room visits; outpat ient/same -day/ambulatory procedures; 
observation/short stay units; rehabilitation facilities; hospice facilities; nursing homes; or 
clinical research/phase 1 units . 
Note: The term “prolongation of existing hospitalization” refers to any extension of an 
inpatient hospitalization beyond the stay anticipated or required for the reason  for the 
initial admission as determined by the Investigator  or treating physician.  
 A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to 
conduct norm al life functions;  or 
Note: A serious adverse event (SAE) specifically related to visual threat would be 
interpreted as any potential impairment or damage to the subject’s eyes (e.g., 
hemorrhage, retinal detachment, central corneal ulcer or damage to the o ptic nerve).  
 A congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
Important medical events that may not result in death,  are life-threatening,  or require 
hospitalization may be considered serious when, based upon appropriate medical 
judgment, they may jeopardize the subject  and may require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  
 Procedures for Reporting Adverse Events  
9.4.1 Reporting an Adverse Event  
All AEs and their outcomes must be reported to Ora, the Sponsor , and the Institut ional 
Review Board (IRB) / Independent Ethics Committee  (IEC) as required by the IRB/IEC, 
Tavilermide Ophthalmic Solution  Mimetogen Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc.  
Clinical Trial Protocol: MIM -728 FINAL  Version 2.0 03Jul2019  
 
CONFIDENTIAL   Page 42 of 70 federal, state, or local regulations and governing health authorities and recorded on the 
appropriate eCRF . AEs are to be collected from the first administration of s tudy drug to 
the subject’s exit from the study.  
9.4.2 Reporting a Serious Adverse Event  
To ensure subject safety, all SAEs , regardless of relationship to the IP, must be 
immediately reported. All information relevant to the SAE  must be recorded on the 
appropriat e eCRFs . The Investigator  is obligated to pursue and obtain information 
requested by Ora and/or the Sponsor  in addition to that information reported on the 
eCRF . All subjects experiencing an SAE  must be followed  until the SAE is resolved or 
reaches a clini cally stable outcome, with or without sequelae , and the outcome reported.  
In the event of an SAE , the Investigator  should inform the clinical project manager, 
, that an SAE occurred by phone, fax, or email immediately.  
  
  
  
  
  
  
The site is to complete the initial SAE Report Form and submit the form to the clinical 
project manager as soon as is feasible but no more than 24 hours after becoming aware of 
the event. Furthermore, the site is to transcribe the requisite SAE information to the 
appropriate eCRF no more tha n 24 hours after becoming aware of the event.  After the 
initial report, all additional follow -up evaluations must be reported to Ora within one 
business day of receipt of the information.  
The Ora clinical project manager will notify the Medical Monitor and  the Sponsor of the 
SAE as soon as is feasible but no more than 24 hours after becoming aware of the event.  
The Investigator  must obtain and maintain in his/her files all pertinent medical records, 
information, and medical judgments from colleagues who ass isted in the treatment and 
follow -up of the subject; provide Ora and the Sponsor  with a complete case history, 
which includes a statement as to whether the event was or was not suspected to be related 
to the use of the IP; and inform the IRB of the SAE  within their guidelines for reporting 
SAEs . If an SAE is considered reportable per Alpha IRB’s guidelines, the  site should 
report the SAE promptly but  no more than 10 business days after becoming aware of the 
event.  
For questions regarding the seriousness of an AE, the site is to contact the Medical 
Monitor directly.  The site may also consult with the Medical Monitor additionally as 
needed.

CONFIDENTIAL   Page 43 of 70   
  
  
  
  
  
9.4.3 Reporting a Suspected Unexpected Adverse Reaction  
All AEs that are ‘suspected’ and ‘unexpected’ are to be reported to Ora, the Sponsor , and 
the IRB/IEC as required by the IRB/IEC, federal, state, or local regulations and 
governing health authorities.  
 Type and Duration of Follow -Up of Subjects after Adverse Events  
AEs that are ongoing at the subject’s exit from the study are to be marked as such in the 
subject’s source document and e CRF. Sites are to follow AEs ongoing at the subject’s 
exit from the study until resolution or until the condition is considered ongoing and 
stable. Documentation of AE follow -up is to be maintained at the clinical site.  
 Pregnancy  
Pregnancy in itself is not  considered an AE or SAE (unless there is a suspicion that an IP 
may have interfered with the effectiveness of a contraceptive medication), but it is an 
important medical event that must be followed up. Any pregnancy that occurs during the 
clinical trial w here the fetus could have been exposed to the study drug(s) must be 
followed through the outcome of the pregnancy.  
If a female has a positive pregnancy test during the study, then the Investigator  will notify 
Ora immediately. The Investigator  shall request  from the subject and/or the subject’s 
physician copies of all related medical reports during the pregnancy and shall document 
the outcome of the pregnancy. The Investigator  will retain these reports together with the 
subject’s source documents and will pr ovide a copy of all documentation to Ora.

11 DATA HANDLING AND RECORDKEEPING  
 Data Collection  
The Investigator  is responsible for ensuring that study data is completely and accurately 
recorded on each subject’s eCRF , source document, and all stu dy-related material. All 
study data should also be attributable, legible, contemporaneous, and original. Recorded 
datum should only be corrected in a manner that does not obliterate, destroy, or render 
illegible the previous entry (e.g., by drawing a singl e line through the incorrect entry and 

Tavilermide Ophthalmic Solution  Mimetogen Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc.  
Clinical Trial Protocol: MIM -728 FINAL  Version 2.0 03Jul2019  
 
CONFIDENTIAL   Page 49 of 70 writing the revision next to the corrected data). An individual who has corrected a data 
entry should make clear who made the correction and when  by adding to the correction 
his/her initials as well as the date of the  correction.  
Source document entries are to be transcribed to eCRFs. iMedNet is to be the EDC 
system and Statistics & Data Corporation (SDC) is the contracted data management firm. 
Transcription to eCRFs is to be accomplished using software that conforms t o 21 CFR 
Part 11 requirements. Only  staff who are masked and who have received training on the 
iMedNet system and the study -specific eCRFs will be allowed access to this study’s EDC 
environment. The EDC system is to maintain an audit trail to capture all c hanges made to 
the eCRFs. Each investigative site is to be supplied with their subject data on compact 
disks that are to be maintained on file by the Investigator . 
Source documents may include a subject’s medical records, hospital charts, clinic charts, 
the Investigator ’s study subject files, as well as the results of diagnostic tests such as X -
rays, laboratory tests, and EKGs. The Investigator ’s copy of the eCRFs serves as the 
Investigator ’s record of a subject’s study -related data.  
 Data Directly Recorded on the Electronic Case Report Forms  
The results of all trial assessments are to be documented and then transcribed to the 
eCRFs. No data is to be recorded directly on the eCRFs and considered source data with 
the exception of  the IRT-assigned randomization  number, the treatment arm, and any kit 
numbers . 
 Retention of Documentation  
All study -related  correspondence, subject  records, consent forms, record of the 
distribution and use of all IP, and copies of eCRFs  should be maintained on file for at 
least two ye ars after the last approval of a marketing application in an ICH region and 
until there are no pending or contemplated marketing applications in an ICH region; or 
until at least two years have elapsed since the formal discontinuation of clinical 
developmen t of the IP. These documents will be retained for a longer period if required 
by the applicable regulatory requirements or by an agreement with the Sponsor . It is the 
responsibility of the Sponsor  to inform the Investigator /institution as to when these 
documents no longer need to be retained.  
If the responsible Investigator  retires, relocates, or for other reasons withdraws from the 
responsibility of keeping study records, custody must be transferred to a person who will 
accept the responsibility. The Spons or must be notified in writing of the name and 
address of the new custodian.

should be maintained by the Investigator  and his/her staff with adequate precautions as to 
ensure that the confidentiality of the data  is in accordance with local, state, and federa l 
laws and regulations.  
Monitors, auditors and other authorized representatives of Ora, the Sponsor , the IRB/IEC 
approving this study, the US Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ), the US Department 
of Health and Human Services ( DHHS ), other domestic governme nt agencies, and other 
foreign regulatory agencies will be granted direct access to the subject’s original medical 
and study records for verification of the data and/or clinical trial procedures. Access to 
this information will be permitted to the aforemen tioned individuals to the extent 
permitted by law.  
A report of the results of this study may be published or sent to the appropriate health 
authorities in any country in which the IP may ultimately be marketed, but the subject’s 
identity will not be disclo sed in these documents.  
 Institutional Review Board Approval  
This protocol and the informed consent document and any subsequent modifications will 
be reviewed and approved in accordance with IRB regulations (U.S. 21 CFR Part 
56.103). The Investigator  must o btain appropriate IRB approval before initiating the 
study and re -approval at least annually.  
Only an IRB/ IEC approved version of the informed consent form will be used.  
 Subject Informed Consent  
Informed consent/assent must take place before any study -specific procedures are 
initiated. Signed and dated written informed consent must be obtained from each subject 
and/or from the subject’s parent or legal guardian prior to enrollment into the study. If the 
subject is under the legal age of consent, the consent  form must be signed by a legal 
guardian or as required by state and/or local laws and regulations.  
All informed consent/assent forms must be approved for use by the Sponsor  and receive 
approval/favorable opinion from an IRB/IEC prior to their use. If the consent form 
Tavilermide Ophthalmic Solution  Mimetogen Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc.  
Clinical Trial Protocol: MIM -728 FINAL  Version 2.0 03Jul2019  
 
CONFIDENTIAL   Page 51 of 70 requires revision (e.g., due to a protocol amendment or significant new safety 
information), it is the Investigator ’s responsibility to ensure that the amended informed 
consent is reviewed and approved by Ora prior to submission to the governi ng IRB/IEC 
and that it is read, signed and dated by all subjects subsequently enrolled in the study as 
well as those currently enrolled in the study.  
If informed consent is taken under special circumstances ( e.g., oral informed consent), 
then the procedure s to be followed must be determined by Ora and/or Sponsor  and 
provided in writing by Ora and/or Sponsor  prior to the consent process.  
 Modifications of the Protocol  
This study will be conducted in compliance with the most recently approved version  of 
the pr otocol. Any change to the protocol or ICF that affects the scientific intent, study 
design, or subject safety or may affect a subject’s  willingness to continue participation in 
the study is considered an amendment to this protocol and/or ICF. All such amen dments 
will be submitted to the IRB for approval prior to becoming effective.  
 Quality Control and Quality Assurance  
Each Investigator  and site participating in this clinical trial are to permit trial -related 
monitoring, audits, IRB/IEC review, and regulat ory inspections and provide direct access 
to source data/documents and trial records.  
During the course of the study a monitor, or designee, will make routine site visits to 
review protocol compliance, assess IP accountability, and ensure the study is bein g 
conducted according to the pertinent regulatory requirements. The review of the subjects’ 
medical records will be performed in a manner that adequately maintains subject 
confidentiality. Further details of the study monitoring will be outlined in a monit oring 
plan.  
Regulatory authorities of domestic and foreign agencies, Ora, Inc.  quality assurance , the 
Sponsor  and/or the designees of these parties may carry out on -site inspections and/or

CONFIDENTIAL   Page 67 of 70 APPENDIX 3: ADVERSE EVENT  (AE)  DEFINITIONS  
Severity  
 Mild : Event is noticeable to the subject, but is easily tolerated and does not 
interfere with the subject’s daily activities.  
 Moderate : Event is bothersome, possibly requiring additional therapy, and may 
interfere with the subject’s daily activities.  
 Severe : Event is intolerable, nece ssitates additional therapy or alteration of 
therapy, and interferes with the subject’s daily activities.  
Relationship to Investigational Product  (IP) 
 Suspected : A reasonable possibility exists that the IP caused the AE. A suspected 
AE can be further defin ed as:  
o Definite : Relationship exists when the AE follows a reasonable sequence 
from the time of IP administration, follows a known response pattern of 
the drug class, is confirmed by improvement on stopping the IP and no 
other reasonable cause exists.  
o Prob able: Relationship exists when the AE follows a reasonable sequence 
from the time of IP administration, follows a known response pattern of 
the drug class, is confirmed by improvement on stopping the IP and the 
suspect IP is the most likely of all causes.  
o Possible : Relationship exists when the AE follows a reasonable sequence 
from the time of IP administration, but could also have been produced by 
the subject’s clinical state or by other drugs administered to the subject.  
 Not Suspected: A reasonable possibi lity does not exist that the IP caused the AE. 
o Not Related:  Concurrent illness, concurrent medication, or other known 
cause is clearly responsible for the AE, the administration of the IP and the 
occurrence of the AE are not reasonably related in time, OR exposure to 
IP has not occurred.  
Expectedness  
 Unexpected: An AE that is not listed in the Investigator’s Brochure (IB) or is not 
listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed.  
 Expected :  An AE that is listed in the IB at the specificity and severity that has 
been observed.  
 Not applicable: An AE unrelated to the IP.

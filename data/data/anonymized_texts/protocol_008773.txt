STUDY OVERVIEW  
Eye fatigue is a growing concern for the vision community.  In large part, this eye fatigue is thought to be exasperated  by digital device use, which permeates most all of everyone’s lives including work and play.  
Upwards of three -quarters of the general population may express symptoms of eye fatigue, yet may not 
know that it is not normal, or that there may be methods to reduce or eliminate eye fatigue.  Despite its prevalence, the ocular causes of eye fatigue or unknown and may be related to the cornea/contact lens surface, the accommodative system, the convergence system, overall postural/muscle fatigue, or a 
combination  of these or other causes.  The current study aims to systematically investigate the 
incremental benefits in ameliorating eye fatigue provided by (a) an optimized contact  lens spherical 
prescription, (b ) a lens with  highly wettable surface, and (c ) a lens with optics to aid the accommodative 
and convergence systems (in addition to a highly wettable lens surface).

PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS  
KEY OBJECTIVE  1. Subject -reported eye fatigue (0 -100 rating scale)  
 
KEY ENDPOINTS  Superiority  (change)  of subject -reported rating >8 rating units   
STUDY DESIGN  The proposed stu dy design is a subject masked, 2 x 2  randomized, crossover 
(with a baseline reference) comparing the difference in fatigue rating 
relative to baseline, where the baseline the is the response for subject 
habitual lenses, with optimized power, worn on their typical (e.g. 2 week, 1 
month) replacement schedule. The study design is balanced for residuals with 
four sources of variation: lens, sequence group, period and participant. To 
adjust for individual differences prior to study entrance, difference scores 
will be used as response variables in the analyses.  The same number of 
participants will be randomized to each of two possibl e lens sequence 
groups: {A, B}, {B, A }.  Baseline will be evalu ated prior to any testing of A 
and B.  Specifically, A and B are:  
Baseline = Subject habitual lenses, with optimized power, habitual 
replacement  
A = DAILIES TOTAL 1 sphere  (DT1)  
B = DAILITES TOTAL 1 MULTIFOCAL  (DT1 MF)  
 
Subjects will be randomize d into two equal groups of those that  have each 
of the two sequences ( {A, B}, {B, A}) (balanced Latin Square design) .   
 
STATISTICAL 
CONSIDERATIONS   
Sample size  N=42  
Hypothesis  1. Subject -reported eye fatigue difference scores (lens A  – baseline) 
comparing t he change in response for lens A  to baseline are <0 (i.e. 
fatigue  rating was improved with lens A  over baseline).  This 
hypothesis tests if a lens with enhanced surface (DT1) provides 
better fatigue ratings than a typical lens witho ut an optimized 
surface  (optimized habitual) .  
2. Subject -reported eye fatigue difference scores (lens B  – baseline) 
comparing t he change in response for lens B  to baseline are <0 (i.e. 
fatigue  rating was improved with lens B over baseline).  This 
hypothesis tests if a lens with enhanced surface and  enhanced 
optics  (DT1 MF)  provides better fatigue ratings than a typical lens 
without an enhanced surface or enhanced optics  (optimized 
habitual) . 
3. Subject -reported eye fatigue diffe rence scores (lens B – lens A ) 
comparing the d ifference in response for lens B to lens A  are <0 (i.e. 
fatigue  rating was improved with lens B over lens A ).  This 
hypothesis tests if a lens with enhanced surface AND enhanced 
optics (DT1 MF) provides better fatigue ratings than a lens with only 
enhanced surface (DT1) characteristics.

 Page 6 of 12 RATIONALE AND SIGNIFICANCE :   
According to a recent survey by the Vision Council, nearly 90% of Americans use digital devices for more 
than 2 hours per day, with average use around 8 hours.  Results from this same survey indicate that as 
many as 65% of Americans experience symptoms of eye fatigue as a result of digital device use (Vision 
Council 2016).  Recent work by our group (Kollbaum ARVO 2016) indicates that in another typical population 76% of the population suffer from symptoms of eye fatigue, and frequency of reported eye fatigu e was similar whether individuals wore soft contact lenses or not.  However, of those that wore 
soft contact lenses, they were more likely to describe their eye fatigue as a feeling of “dryness”, whereas non-soft contact lens wearers were more likely to de scribe their eye fatigue as a feeling of “strain”. 
Despite these differences, however, this result indicates that soft contact lenses are not generally the cause of eye fatigue reported (e.g. reported eye fatigue is more than just contact lens related dryn ess), 
and if not the cause, could they be the treatment?  Recent work by our group (Kollbaum ARVO 2016) has also identified that sufferers of eyestrain most frequently  use descriptors of straining, dryness, and 
tiredness .  This work also found that the sufferers of eyestrain can consistently differentiate and group 
the symptoms of eyestrain into 3 clusters of g lobal (e.g. headache), surface (e.g. dryness), and optical 
(e.g. blurring)  sensations.  This result provides confidence that the “affects” of eyestra in are known and 
that they are the main components of eyestrain.  With this knowledge, work on identifying the potentially multifaceted cause and possible treatments can then occur in a systematic way. For instance, DAILIES TOTAL 1 is a lens with unique su rface characteristics that are hypothesized to minimize 
symptoms of dryness.  Accordingly, can it ameliorate reported symptoms of eye fatigue , specifically the 
surface symptom components of eyestrain ? Alternatively, could the optical manipulations provided  by 
DAILIES TOTAL 1 Multifocal ameliorate both the surface and optical sensations sufferers experience?  
 
Furthermore, a recent double -masked, randomized, bilateral cross -over study  of pre -presbyopic subjects  
(Orsborn GSLS 2016) indicates that when two lens es of the same material are compared, one with 
typical single vision optics and one with optimized optics to decrease accommodative need, individuals 
report no change in the surface or dryness component of their eye fatigue, but do report a decrease in 
the optical components of eye fatigue  (such as straining) .  Accordingly, DAILIES TOTAL 1 multifocal, as a 
single use lens with optimized surface qualities and optimized optics, may be a lens capable of ameliorating eye reported eye fatigue by acting on both t he surface and optical sensations that are 
believed to be the largest components of eye fatigue (Kollbaum 2016).  
 The current proposal briefly outlines potential strategies to systematically investigate the questions  
highlighted above .  If the results are favorable, the results may serve to help practitioners understand 
how the DAILIES TOTAL 1 family of products may help ameliorate symptoms of digital eye fatigue.  
 
AIM : To quantify the real- time subject- reported fatigue in symptomatic,  non-daily replacement silicone 
hydrogel soft contact  lens wearers and the change in symptomology associated with change to DAILIES 
TOTAL 1 (sphere), DAILIES TOTAL 1 multifocal  (LO Add) , relative to normal replacement of habitual lens .   
 
1. No diagnosis of d ry eye or ocular surface disease  
2. Corneal plane cylinder less than or equal to 0.75 D  
3. No diagnosis of any accommodative or convergence problem

 Page 7 of 12 METHODS :  
 
STUDY DESIGN:   The proposed stu dy design is a subject masked, 2 x 2  randomized, crossover (with a 
reference) comparing the difference in fatigue rating relative to baseline, where the baseline the is the 
response for subject habitual lenses, with optimized power, worn on their typical (e.g. 2 week, 1 month) 
replacement schedule. The study design is balanced for residuals with four sources of variation: lens, 
sequence group, period and participant. To adjust for individual differences prior to study entrance, difference scores will be used as response variables in the analy ses.  The same number of participants 
will be randomized to each of two possibl e lens sequence groups: {A, B }, or {B, A}.  Baseline will be 
evalu ated prior to any testing of A and B .  Specifically, A  and B are:  
Baseline = Subject habitual lenses, with optimized power, habitual replacement  
A = DAILIES TOTAL 1 sphere  
B = DAILITES TOTAL 1 MULTIFOCAL  
 Note:  To be included in the study, subject -reported eye fatigue at least once per week 
with baseline (optimized habitual lens, habitual replacement schedule)  is required.  
 Subjects will be randomized into two equal groups of those that have each of the two sequences ( {A, B}, 
{B, A}) (balanced Latin Square design) .   
 At first visit additional baseline, demographic data, and data will be collected.  Over refraction will be 
performed to determine the optimal habitual prescription.  Subjects will then be dispensed a new pair of their habitual lenses to be worn on their same replacement cycle.  Subjects will, however, not be told 
that they were given new lenses, b ut rather to think that these lenses are the same as the ones they 
brought in.  Daily patient -reported outcome measures will be collected for 7 days ±3 days) of wear.   
 At the follow- up visit, the subject will be rescreened to assure they still meet the enrollment criteria.  If 
so, in -office measures will be performed . The subject will then be randomized to DT1 sphere or DT1 MF  
Lo add .  Each lens will be  worn daily for 7 (±3) days .  After 7 (±3) days  in-office measures will be 
collected, and the next lens dispensed.  There will be 4 visits in all.  
Visit 1 = baseline/dispense new optimal habitual  on normal replacement schedule  
Visit 2 = follow -up habitual/dispense pair 1  
Visit 3 = follow -up pair 1/dispense pair 2  
Visit 4 = follow -up pair 2 /exit

SAMPLE SIZE DETERMINATION  
The comparison of interest is DT1 sphere and DT1 MF Lo add, so the sample size calculation was based  
on detecting a difference between these 2 lenses.  
 
1. The proposed study design is a 2  x 2 crossover design balanced for residuals with four sources of 
variation: lens, sequence group, period and participant. The same number of participants will be 
randomize d to each of two possible len s sequence groups: {A, B}, {B, A} .  Because each lens is 
preceded by every other lens exactly twice we can check for lens carryover effects; if the 
carryover effect is the same for each lens type, these effects cancel when comp aring differences 
in lens means.  
2. The primary outcome measures are difference in subjective ratings for the current trial lenses 
normalized to the ratings made at baseline wearing habitual lenses, i.e., ratings will be assessed 
using an integer scale of 0 -100 with semantic anchoring and the rating at baseline will be 
subtracted from the rating made with each one of the three trial lenses.   
3. Ideally, the sample size analysis would incorporate ‘known’ estimates of the mean, variance and 
(autoregressive) covar iance of subjective ratings for the habitual and each of the three study 
lenses measured in a comparable experimental design to the proposed three- arm crossover 
study.  Here, we rely on ratings data from previous CORL studies to inform the power analysis. 
Specifically, we have typically observed (1) individual differences in baseline ratings with 
habitual lenses, (2) period effects such that ratings that are, on average, lower and also more 
variable at follow -up assessments, and (3) moderate to strong withi n-participant correlations in 
ratings assessed with different study lenses.  A limitation of the previous data is that that we 
have typically observed non -significant LENS*PERIOD interactions in the fitted linear mixed 
regression models.  So, for the curre nt analysis, we base the effect size for the a priori  power 
analysis on a desired (i.e., clinically relevant) pairwise difference of 9 units in subjective rating.  
Previous data suggests that the expected variability ( σ) in ratings during follow -up assessments 
is ~15 -19 rating units with correlations ranging from 0.50 -0.60.  
4. To arrive at the initial (unadjusted) sample size estimate, we performed a power analysis for a 
within -participants comparison of the mean difference in the normalized ratings (i. e., change re: 
rating at baseline wearing pristine habitual lens) for two study lenses.  Specifically, although we 
will initially fit linear mixed effects models to the data and obtain least -squares estimates of the 
pairwise mean differences in rating, we can the required sample size to power a paired- samples 
t test for normal (continuous) mean difference

test statistics are  
𝑡𝑡= 𝑁𝑁1/2�𝑑𝑑�−𝜇𝜇0
𝑠𝑠𝑑𝑑� ~ 𝑡𝑡(𝑁𝑁−1,𝛿𝛿)  or, equivalently, 𝑡𝑡2~𝐹𝐹(1,𝑁𝑁−1,𝛿𝛿2) 
where 𝑑𝑑̅ and 𝑠𝑠𝑑𝑑 are the sample mean and standard deviation of the differences, and  
𝛿𝛿=𝑁𝑁1/2�𝜇𝜇𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑−𝜇𝜇0

represent the non -centrality parameter and standard deviatio n of the paired difference scores, 
respectively.   
5. Our calculation assumed a standard deviation of 18 rating units. With equal variances, the 
estimated 𝜎𝜎𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 =(𝜎𝜎12+𝜎𝜎22−2𝜌𝜌𝜎𝜎1𝜎𝜎2)1/2= 18�2∗(1−𝜌𝜌).   We varied both the sample 
mean between 7 and 12 units  in steps of 1 unit and the within -participant correlation between 
0.40 and 0.60 in steps of 0.05 to compute the number of pairs of observations needed to 
achieve a minimum of 80% power at significance level of α=0.05 and a non -directional test (Ho ≠ 
0 mea n difference) .  Table 1 and Figure 1 show the results under this scenario.  In Table 1 , rows 
corresponding to a mean rating difference of 9 units are enclosed in the box.  For correlation of 
0.50, the estimated number of participants required to detect a m oderate effect size of 
9/18=0.50 is 34.  Because we want to balance the design for residuals, a total sample size of 
N=36 (unadjusted for dropout) is needed to assign 6 participants to each sequence group. To 
detect the same effect size with slightly weaker correlations the sample size should be increased 
to N=42.   Figure 1 shows that rating differences ≥ 9 units could be detected for correlations ≥ 
0.40 with sample of 40 or fewer participants.

LENSES  
The spherical power of all corrections will be monocularly, distance vision optimized .  Specifically, lens 
powers may not be the same for all types of lenses, due to power -targeting during manufacture, on -eye 
flexure, etc.  Optimization entails providing the lens for each eye that monocularly provides an objective 
improvement in acuity and up to - 0.25 D more for any patient -reported quality improvement.   All lenses 
will be over- labeled, so as to, as best as possible,  preserve masking (less blister pack shape).  Of note, 
subjects will not be able to tell the difference between DT1 and DT1 MF  (Lo add)  because of the same 
blister shape, but may  be able to tell a difference between these and habitual.  
  
OUTCOME MEASURES  
Primary:  
1. Subject -reported eye fatigue (0-100 rating scale , 0=optimal)

 Page 11 of 12 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  
Our primary analysis will use SAS PROC MIXED (or R LMER) to fit linear mixed effects model to the 
normalized change from baseline ratings data.  Because the proposed design is balanced for residuals 
we could fit the data using PROC GLM if there are no missing data to obtain identical parameter 
estimates.  A separate model will be fit to the data for each rating scale tested.  All fou r sources of 
variation ( lens, sequence group, period and participant) will be included as class variables.   We will also 
test for a carryover effect by including a character- valued variable whose value represents the lens worn 
in the previous period (‘0’ assigned to the carryover variable for the first period).  Thus, the initial 
models used to analyze the data include effects for sequence group, lens, period and the overall 
carryover.  Participant -within -sequence group will be included as a random effect.   Although LSMEANS 
due to lens will not be estimable in these models, differences between trial lenses are  if we assume the 
carryover effect is the same for each lens type.  Evidence of a significant Lens -by-Period interaction will 
be handled by running se parate analyses within each period using, for example, a two -sample 
independent samples t -test.  
 The analysis will not specifically make p -value adjustment for multiple testing  as the comparisons are 
planned  in advance.   The omnibus in an (M)ANOVA or para meter estimates for a factor in a Linear 
Mixed -Effects regression model provide the protection against "family -wise"  error,  i.e., once the 
omnibus test (or saturated model) detec ts an effect at say alpha=0.05,  doing subsequent pairwise 
comparisons on different levels of the factor(s) can no longer generate a false alarm (Type I error)!    
  
Having said that,  as a follow -up, exploratory technique, we may also use  Dunnett’s method for 
performing  all pairwise  compa risons of the means and other margins across levels of our categorical 
variables (e.g.,  lens)  after model estimation.   This method  adjusts the p -values and confidence intervals 
for multiple comparisons  involving a fixed reference category (i.e.,  the contro l lens).     
 
 
PUBLICATION PLAN :  Work will be presented at least one international meeting, such as Global Specialty 
Lens Symposium  or ARVO .  The work will also be prepared for submission for peer -reviewed publication 
(e.g. Optometry and Vision Science).  Trade publications may also be prepared at Sponsor’s request and 
expense.

 2 INTRODUCTION  
The ‘ PROtective Ventilation with High versus Low PEEP during One–lung 
Ventilation for THORacic surgery ’ (PROTHOR ) randomized clinical trial 
compares a n intraoperative ventilation strategy with high er positive end –
expiratory pressure (PEEP) with recruitment maneuvers (‘ higher  PEEP’) to a 
conventional strategy consist ing of  lower  PEEP of 5 cmH 2O without recruitment 
maneuvers (‘low er PEEP’) , both with low tidal volumes .1 The primary objective of 
this study is to determine whether ‘high er PEEP’ is superior to ‘low er PEEP’ with 
regard to the incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications (PPC). 
Enrollment of patients in the PROTHOR  study is progressing well  and the study 
is planned to enroll the last patient in the second trimester of 2024.  
To prevent outcome repo rting bias and data –driven analysis results, the 
International Conference on Harmonization of Good Clinical Practice (ICH –GCP) 
recommends that clinical trials should be analyzed according to a pre –specified 
detailed Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) . This document present s the updated and 
finalized SAP  of the PROTHOR  study . 
  
PROTHOR  Statistical Analysis Plan (v 1.0, January 17th , 202 4) 
 3 METHODS  
Design , ethics and registration  
The PROTHOR  study  is an international, multicenter, parallel, two –group, 
prospective, randomized, patient and outcome –assessor blinded superiority 
clinical trial designed to determine if an intra –operative high er PEEP strategy is 
superior to a low er PEEP strategy with respect to the development of PPC in 
adult patients submitted to thoracic surgery  requiring one –lung vent ilation (OLV) . 
The protocol, with a detailed description of the study population, the two 
strategies and follow –up plan of the PROTHOR  trial were previously published  
elsewhere .1 The PROTHOR  study is registered at clinicaltrials.gov (study 
identifier [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ) and was approved by the Ethical Committee of the 
Istanbul University, Medical Faculty, Turkey (2016/483, April 8, 2016) . 
Additionally, the institutional review board at the University Hospital Dresden, 
Technische Universität Dresden, Dresden, Germany, approved the study on 
23.09.2016 (reference no. EK 392092016). The respective review boards of 
participating sites approved the study  as well . 
Randomization and blinding  
Eligible patients are randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio to the ‘higher PEEP ’ or 
‘lower PEEP ’ strategy. The allocation sequence is computer –generated  by an 
independent investigator  using permuted blocks of random  size of four, six , and 
eight patients, and stratified per center. Randomization is performed by local 
investigators patient –by–patient employing a dedicated, password protected, 
SSL–encrypted website.  
At each site, at least two investigators are involved with the study. One 
local investigator randomiz es the patients  immediately before surgery , and is 
PROTHOR  Statistical Analysis Plan (v 1.0, January 17th , 202 4) 
 4 responsible for the trial intervention  and data collection. A second local 
investigator remains blinded to the assigned treatment, and is responsible for 
postoperative data collection.  
Outcomes  
The primary study outcome is a collapsed composite of PPC developing within 
the first five postoperative days. This endpoint follows the European 
Perioperative Clinical Outcome (EPCO) definition and has been used before in 
several clinical trials.2-4 A patient  that develop s one or more PPCs is considered 
as meeting the primary outcome . The components of the composite outcome of 
PPC have been defined and described elsewhere,1 and include: 1) aspiration 
pneumonitis; 2) moderate respiratory failure; 3) severe respiratory failure; 4) 
acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS); 5) pulmonary  infection; 6) 
atelectasis; 7) cardiopulmonary edema; 8) pleural effusion; 9) pneumothorax  on 
the non -surgical lung ; 10) pulmonary infiltrates; 11) prolonged air leakage; 12) 
purulent pleuritic; 13)  pulmonary embolism; and 14) lung hemorrhage.  The 
selected  PPC can sensibly be merged  as they share common pathophysiological 
mechanisms and have plausibility to be affected in the same direction by the 
intervention tested in this study . 
Secondary outcomes include: 1) extended PPC, including bronchospasm 
or mild respiratory failure; 2) severe PPC, as defined in a recent published clinical 
trial5 (composite of severe respiratory failure, pneumothorax, ARDS, pulmonary 
infection, prolonged air leakage, purulent pleuritis, new requirement of non -
invasive or invasive ventilation due to respiratory failure and/or atelectasis); 3 ) a 
composite outcome of intraoperative complications, including use of continuous 
positive airway pressure for the non -ventilated lung, use of inhaled  nitric 
PROTHOR  Statistical Analysis Plan (v 1.0, January 17th , 202 4) 
 5 oxide/prostacycline, use of selective fiberoscope insufflation, hypotension 
unresponsive to fluids and/or vasoactive drugs, new arrhythmias unresponsive to 
intervention, need for high dosage of vasoactive drugs, need for massive 
transfusion, life -threatening surgical complication (including major bleeding, 
tension pneumothorax and intracranial injury ), hypoxemia and hypercapnia 
rescue maneuvers; 4) postoperative extrapulmonary complications , including 
systemic inflammatory response syndrome, sepsis,  severe sepsis, septic shock, 
extrapulmonary infection, coma, acute myocardial infarction, acute renal failure, 
disseminated intravascular coagulation, stroke, hepatic failure, and 
gastrointestinal failure ; 5) need for unexpected intensive care unit admiss ion or 
readmission;  6) any postoperative respiratory intervention  used for respiratory 
failure  (new requirement of non -invasive ventilation or mechanical ventilation); 7) 
number of hospital -free days at day 28; 8) in-hospital  mortality ; 9) 90-day 
mortality ; 10) arterial blood gas analysis during surgery (PaO 2, PaCO 2, pHa).  All 
definitions are available in Table 1 . 
Cleaning and closing of the database  
The database will be locked as soon as all data are entered and all discrepant or 
missing data are resolved , after all efforts are employed  to fix missing data, 
complete the database,  and we consider that the remaining issues cannot be 
fixed. At this step, the data will be reviewed before database locking. After 
locking, the data will be  exported for statistical  analysis. At this stage, permission 
for access to the database will be removed for all investigators, and the database 
is archived.  
Missing data  
PROTHOR  Statistical Analysis Plan (v 1.0, January 17th , 202 4) 
 6 No or minimal losses to follow –up for the primary outcome is anticipated. 
Complete –case analysis will be carri ed out for all outcomes. However, if more 
than 5% of missing data is found for the primary outcome, a sensitivity analysis 
using multiple imputations and estimating –equation methods will be carried out.  
Multiple imputation will consider imputation models b ased on prognostic baseline 
and post –baseline variables under a missing at random assumption.  
Sample size  
An adaptive trial design is used, which accumulates data and uses external 
information to modify aspects of the design without undermining the validity and 
integrity of the trial. The group sequential methods design offers  the possibility 
for early stoppin g the study if the experimental treatment shows a statistically 
significant therapeutic advantage at an interim assessment, but also allows early 
stopping for futility if the interim analysis reveals that, with high probability, the 
trial will be negative.  
PROTHOR  is designed to enroll a total of 2378  patients ( 1189  in each 
arm). This number allows the detection of a reduction in the incidence of the 
primary outcome from 23% in the ‘lower PEEP’ group to 17.25% in the ‘higher 
PEEP’ group  (relative risk reduction of 2 5%), considering a type I error of 5%, a 
power of 90%, similar allocation ratio between the arms (1:1) and a dropout rate 
of 5%. The required sample size is calculated based on an estimated effect size 
derived from individual patient data from previous trials ,3,4,6-9 and the LAS VEGAS 
study.10 
An alpha –spending function was used to generate efficacy boundaries and 
a beta -spending function to generate futility boundaries (gamma family spending 
function, type I error 0.05, type I I error 0.1). By using a gamma of −4 for the alpha 
PROTHOR  Statistical Analysis Plan (v 1.0, January 17th , 202 4) 
 7 and gamma of −2 for the beta spending function a moderate hurdle for early 
stopping for efficacy and a reasonable chance to stop early due to futility is 
considered. A non -binding futility boundary was con structed in such a way that it 
can be overruled if desired without inflating the type 1 error. This flexibility is 
important, since the data monitoring committee might well prefer to keep the trial 
going to gather additional information, despite crossing t he futility boundary 
(Figure 1  and Table 2 ). 
Interim analyses  
Five interim assessments for evaluation of efficacy, harm, and/or futility were 
planned, with the aim of possibly stopping the study early. The planned number 
of assessments describes the number of time points, including the closing date 
of the study, at which the investigator plans to analyze the thus far collected data. 
The spacing of assessments will be equal. Therefore, interim anal yses were  
performed after 20% (476 patients), 40% (952 patients), 60% (1426 patients), 
and 80% (1902 patients)  of the planned inclusions, and the final analysis will be 
performed after 2378 patients  (100%) are  included ( Table 2 ). 
Statistical analyses  
All statistical analyses will be conducted on an intention –to–treat basis, with 
patients analy zed according to their assigned treatment arms , except for cases 
lost to follow up or withdrawal of informed consent . In addition,  a per–protocol 
analysis will be con ducted . Variables will be expressed as counts and 
percentages, means and standard deviations (SD), or medians and interquartile 
ranges (IQR) whenever appropriate.  
The study was designed to detect a difference in the primary outcome with 
90% power , using a two–sided superiority hypothesis test with a significance level 
PROTHOR  Statistical Analysis Plan (v 1.0, January 17th , 202 4) 
 8 of 0.0428 (correspondent to the Z -value of 2.025 for efficacy or futility in the final 
analysis in Table 2 ) and presented with  a two–sided 95 % confidence interval . 
Secondary outcomes will be assessed using a two –sided superiority hypothesis 
test with a significance level of 0.05 and presented with a two –sided 95% 
confidence interval. In addition to the unadjusted p values  for secondary 
outcomes, a Holm –Bonferroni pro cedure will be applied to control for multiple 
testing.11 Analyses will be performed using the software R (R Core Team, 2016, 
Vienna, Austria).  A list of proposed tables and figures is in Table 3. 
Trial profile  
Patient flows will be represented in a CONSORT flowchart ( Proposed Inserts ). 
Baseline characteristics  
A description of the baseline characteristics of the trial participants will be 
presented by treatment group ( Proposed Inserts ). Discrete variables will be 
summarized as numbers (%). Percentages will be calculated according to the 
number of trial participants for whom data are available. Whenever  values are 
missing, the denominator will be stated in the table and no assumptions o r 
imputations will be made. Continuous variables will be summarized by either 
mean and standard deviation (SD) or median and interquartile range (IQR), 
according to the observed distribution of the variable.  
Adherence to study protocol  and ventilatory vari ables  
Surgical and perioperative characteristics will be reported ( Proposed Inserts ). 
Ventilatory variables and vital signs will be reported after intubation, one hour, 
and in the last hour of surgery and compared between the two groups. Absolute 
differences between groups will be calculated using median regression for 
continuous variabl es (reported as median difference) and generalized linear 
PROTHOR  Statistical Analysis Plan (v 1.0, January 17th , 202 4) 
 9 models with binomial distribution and an identity link for binary variables (reported 
as difference in percentages).  Plots comparing ventilatory variables and vital 
signs among the groups during the  first three hours of surgery and in the last hour 
will be drawn  (presenting the data as mean and 95% confidence interval in each 
time point).  
Other daily characteristics  
Daily variables will be reported according to the description in Proposed Inserts . 
Absolute differences between groups will be calculated using median regression 
for continuous variables (reported as median difference) and generalized linear 
models with binomial distribution and an identity link for binary variables (reported 
as difference  in percentages). Plots comparing daily variables among the groups 
will be constructed (presenting the data as mean and 95% confidence interval in 
each time point).  
Primary outcome  
The effect of ‘high er PEEP’ compared to ‘lower PEEP ’ on the incidence of PPC 
will be assessed using a mixed –effect generalized linear model with binomial 
distribution and identity link, with sites included as random effects to account for 
the clustering effect and reported as absolute difference with a two –sided 95% 
confidence interval . Results will be presented in a table of outcomes ( Proposed 
Inserts ). 
Secondary outcomes  
For binary outcomes, the effect of ‘high er PEEP’ compared to ‘lower PEEP ’ will 
be assessed using a mixed –effect generalized linear model with binomial 
distribution and identity link, with sites included as random effects to account for 
the clustering effect and reported as absolute difference with a two –sided 95% 
PROTHOR  Statistical Analysis Plan (v 1.0, January 17th , 202 4) 
 10 confidence interval. For continuous outcomes, the comparison will be made usin g 
a mixed -effect median regression with sites also including as clustering effect, 
and reported as median difference with a two –sided 95% confidence interval. 90-
day mortality will be assessed using Kaplan –Meier curves, and hazard ratios with 
95% confidenc e intervals will be calculated with (shared -frailty) Cox proportional 
hazard models without adjustment for covariates and including sites as frailty. 
The proportional hazard assumptions will be tested using scaled Schoenfeld 
residuals and alternative param etric survival models will be used if the 
proportionality assumption is not sustained. In addition, a Holm –Bonferroni 
correction to control the family –wide error rate to the p values for all  secondary 
outcomes will be done and presented in a Table.  
Per–protocol analysis  
The per –protocol population will consist of patients truly ventilated according to  
the protocol. Thus, patients will be excluded from this population if receiving 
PEEP < 10 cm  H2O in the ‘higher PEEP’ group or PEEP > 5 cm  H2O and FiO 2 < 
1.0 in the ‘lower PEEP’ group, unless rescue for hypoxemia or hypercapnia 
required adjustments of PEEP and F iO2 as defined by the protocol . 
Subgroup analysis  
Treatment effects on incidence of PPC will be analyzed according to the following 
predefined subgroups: 1) type of surgery ( non–thoracoscopic versus 
thoracoscopic ); 2) positioning ( lateral decubitus versus supine position ); 3) 
baseline SpO 2 < 96% versus SpO 2 ≥ 96%; 4) chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease (COPD) versus non -COPD ; 5) body mass index  < 30 kg/m2 versus ≥ 30 
kg/m2; and 6) duration of one -lung ventilation < 120 versus ≥ 120 minutes . 
Analyses of heterogeneity of effects across subgroups will be performed with the 
PROTHOR  Statistical Analysis Plan (v 1.0, January 17th , 202 4) 
 11 use of treatment –by–subgroup term added to the primary model and will be 
presented in a forest plot.  
Other exploratory analyses  
Given that  the primary outcome of the present study is a  collapsed  composite, 
the choice of the statistical method is an important part of designing since  various 
methods provide different power, depending on the situation. In addition to the 
standard analysis described above, the following analyses will be performed:  
 Count analysis: the number of positive component events (i.e., ‘count ’) 
across the composi te will be assessed. The groups will be compared on 
the count using a Wilcoxon rank sum test, and the odds ratio with the 95% 
confidence interval will be assessed with a cumulative  logistic regression 
model;  
 Individual component analysis: the effect of the  intervention in each 
component will be analyzed estimating the risk ratio and confidence 
intervals with Wald’s likelihood ratio approximation test using a Bonferroni 
correction for multiple comparisons. The 99. 6% Bonferroni –corrected 
confidence intervals will be reported (1 – 0.05/1 4 = 0.99 6); 
 Common effect test: A multivariate (i.e., multiple outcomes per subject) 
generalized estimating equations (GEE) model will be used to estimate a 
common effect odds ratio across the components;  
 Average relative effect  test: The average relative effect test will be 
assessed by averaging the component -specific treatment effect from the 
distinct effects model, and testing whether the average is equal to zero. In 
the GEE distinct effect model a distinct treatment effect is  estimated for 
each component; and  
PROTHOR  Statistical Analysis Plan (v 1.0, January 17th , 202 4) 
 12  Heterogeneity of treatment effect: Heterogeneity of treatment effect across 
components will be assessed by a treatment -by-component interaction 
test in the distinct effects GEE model.

outcome)  Included ‘ deviation from prescribed PEEP or 
tidal volume’ in the definition  ‘deviation from prescribed PEEP or tida l volume’ 
removed from the definition  
Requirement of 
postoperative respiratory 
intervention (secondary 
outcome)  Any requirement of postoperative respiratory 
intervention  Requirement of postoperative respiratory 
intervention  for respiratory failure only (excludes for 
reoperation)  
Secondary outcome  --- Addition of severe postoperative pulmonary 
complications.  
Model for the primary 
outcome  Risk ratio and 95% confidence intervals 
calculated with Wald’s likelihood ratio 
approximation test and with χ2 tests for 
hypothesis testing.  Mixed -effect generalized linear model with binomial 
distribution and identity link, with sites included as 
random effects to account for the clustering effect 
and reported as absolute difference with a two -
sided 95% confidence interval.  
Model for binary 
secondary outcomes  Risk ratio and 95% confidence intervals 
calculated with Wald’s likelihood ratio 
approximation test and with χ2 tests for 
hypothesis testing.  Mixed -effect generalized linear model with binomial 
distribution and identity link, with sites included as 
random effects to account for the clustering effect 
and rep orted as absolute difference with a two -
sided 95% confidence interval.  
Model for hospital -free 
days at day 28  Student t test and reported as the mean 
difference between the two groups. The  
consistency of the findings of the Student t 
test will be confirmed according to the mean 
ratio calculated by a generalized additive 
model considering a zero -inflated beta 
distribution.  Mixed -effect median regression with sites also 
including as clustering effect, and reported as 
median difference w ith a two -sided 95% confidence 
interval.   
Time -to-event analyses 
for PPC  Kaplan –Meier curves will be used to report 
time to postoperative pulmonary 
complications, and hazard ratios with a 95% 
confidence interval will be calculated with 
Cox proportional hazard models without 
adjustment for covariates.  No time -to-event analysis planned to be performed 
for PPC.  
Time -to-event analyses 
for 90 -day mortality  Hazard ratios with 95% confidence intervals 
will be calculated with Cox proportional 
hazard models without adjustment for 
covariates and including sites as frailty.  Hazard ratios with 95% confidence intervals will be 
calculated with (shared -frailty) Cox proportional 
hazard models without adjustment for covariates 
and including sites as frailty.  
Subgrou p analysis 
(definition)  --- Added two additional subgroups: body mass index 
and duration of one -lung ventilation.  
Subgroup analysis  
(method)  The effects on subgroups will be evaluated  
according to the interaction effects between 
each subgroup and the study arms by 
generalized linear models and presented in 
a forest plot.  Analyses of heterogeneity of effects across 
subgroups will be performed with the use of 
treatment -by-subgroup term added to the primary 
model and will be presented in a forest plot.

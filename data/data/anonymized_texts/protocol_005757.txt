6 1. OBJECTIVES  
 
 1.1 
Study Design  
 This is a phase Ib, open label study assessing the safety and tolerability of pembrolizumab in combination with T-DM1.  The population to be studied consists of patients with metastatic HER2 -positive (HER2+) breast cancer previously treated with a taxane and trastuzumab.  The 
study will be conducted as a dose de-escalation study, as the common toxicities of the two agents are not overlapping.  Once the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) is declared, 15 additional eligible patients with metastatic HER2+ breast cancer will be entered into an expansion cohort.

  2. 
BACKGROUND  
 2.1 
Study Disease : Metastatic HER2 -Positive Breast Cancer  
 HER2, also known as neu and c- erbB -2, is an oncogene encoding a tyrosine kinase growth factor 
receptor in the family of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and is amplified in approximately 20% of all human breast cancers.  It is an independent predictor of time to rela pse 
and overall survival in multivariable models, and is a marker of poor prognosis.
1  The functional 
significance of HER2 amplification in breast cancer prompted development of trastuzumab, a monocloncal anti-HER2 antibody.  Addition of trastuzumab to standard chemotherapy produces an overall survival benefit in HER2- amplified metastatic breast cancer.
2  Similarly, trastuzumab 
plus chemotherapy is superior to chemotherapy alone in multiple large, randomized trials of adjuvant therapy in HER2- positive disease.
3-6 
 However, despite significant gains in understanding the biology of HER2- driven cancers and 
developing highly ef fective second -generation HER2-targeted agents such as pertuzumab and T-
DM1, in the metastatic setting acquired resistance to HER2 -directed therapies occurs in virtually 
all patients.  Several mechanisms of resistance have been suggested, including impaired receptor -
antibody binding, truncated HER2 protein, and signaling via alternate pathways or through constitutive activation of the PI3K signaling pathway.
7-11  Further therapeutic approaches are 
therefore needed.  As described in more detail below, there is evidence that supports using the anti-tumor immune response as a therapeutic target in HER2+ breast cancer, especially 
concurrent with antibody- based therap y.

8 The PD -1 pathway in cancer  
The importance of intact immune surveillance in controlling outgrowth of neoplastic 
transformatio n has been known for decades.  Accumulating evidence shows a correlation 
between tumor- infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in cancer tissue and favorable prognosis in 
various malignancies.  In particular, the presence of CD8+ T -cells and the ratio of CD8+ effector 
T-cells / FoxP3+ regulatory T -cells seems to correlate with improved prognosis and long- term 
survival in many solid tumors. 
The PD -1 receptor- ligand interaction is a major pathway hijacked by tumors to suppress immune 
control.  The normal function of PD- 1, expressed on the cell surface of activated T -cells under 
healthy conditions, is to down-modulate unwanted or excessive immune responses, including 
autoimmune reactions.  PD- 1 (encoded by the gene Pdcd1) is an Ig superfamily member related 
to CD28 and CTLA-4 which has been shown to negatively regulate antigen receptor signaling upon engagement of its ligands (PD-L1 and/or PD -L2).  The structure of murine PD-1 has been 
resolved .  PD-1 and family members are type I transmembrane glycoproteins containing an Ig 
Variable -type (V -type) domain responsible for ligand binding and a cytoplasmic tail which is 
responsible for the binding of signaling molecules.  The cytoplasmic tail of PD-1 contains 2 tyrosine-based signaling motifs, an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif (ITIM) and an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based switch motif (ITSM).  Following T- cell stimulatio n, PD-1 
recruits the tyrosine phosphatases SHP-1 and SHP- 2 to the ITSM motif within its cytoplasmic 
tail, leading to the dephosphorylation of effector molecules such as CD3ζ, PKCθ and ZAP70 which are involved in the CD3 T- cell signaling cascade.  The mechanism by which PD-1 down 
modulates T- cell responses is similar to, but distinct from that of CTLA -4 as both molecules 
regulate an overlapping set of signaling proteins.  PD-1 was shown to be expressed on activated lymphocytes including peripheral CD4+ and C D8+ T -cells, B -cells, T regs a nd Natural Killer 
cells.  Expression has also been shown during thymic development on CD4- CD8 - (double 
negative) T -cells as well as subsets of macr ophages and dendritic cells.  The ligands for PD-1 
(PD-L1 and PD-L2) are consti tutively expressed or can be induced in a variety of cell types, 
including non- hematopoietic tissues as well as in  various tumors.  Both ligands are type I 
transmembrane receptors containing both IgV- and IgC -like domains in the extracellular region 
and co ntain short cytoplasmic regions with no known signaling motifs.  Binding of either PD-1 
ligand to PD-1 inhibits T-cell activation triggered through the T- cell receptor.  PD -L1 is 
expressed at low levels on various non-hematopoietic tissues, most notably on vascular endothelium, whereas PD-L2 protein is only detectably expressed on antigen- presenting cells 
found in lymphoid tissue or chronic inflammatory environments.  PD-L2 is thought to control immune T -cell activation in lymphoid organs, whereas PD- L1 ser ves to dampen unwarranted T-
cell fun ction in peripheral tissues.  Although healthy organs express little (if any) PD- L1, a 
variety of cancers were demonstrated to express abundant levels of this T- cell inhibitor.  PD -1 
has been suggested to regulate tumor- specific T -cell expansion in s ubjects with melanoma 
(MEL) .  This suggests that the PD-1/PD- L1 pathway plays a critical role in tumor immune 
evasion and should be considered as an attractive target for therapeutic intervention.  
Pembrolizumab  
Pembrolizumab  is a potent and highly selective humanized monoclonal antibody (mAb) of the 
IgG4/kappa isotype designed to directly block the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2.  Keytruda
TM (pembrolizumab; MK-3475) has recently been approved in the 
NCI Protocol #:

9 United Stated for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma and disease 
progression following ipilumumab and, if BRAF V600 mutation positive, a BRAF inhibitor. Please refer to the Full Prescribing Information for pembrolizumab for complete safety information: http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/drugsatfda/
.   
 Clinical data are derived from an ongoing, first -in-human phase I study (PN001, [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) 
to evaluate the safety and clinical activity of pembrolizumab as a monotherapy, sponsored by 
.  There are five parts to this study (Parts A-D and F) (Investigator’s 
Brochure, 2014).  Part A was a 3+3 dose escalation study in subjects with so lid tumors to evaluate safety, 
tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics, and to determine a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or preliminary recommended phase 2 doses (RP2Ds).  Doses were 1, 3, and 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks (Q2W); doses of either 2 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg were also administered every 3 weeks (Q3W).  All 3 dose levels were well tolerated and no dose- limiting 
toxicities (DLTs) were observed; therefore, the MTD was not determined.  The RP2D was determined by the sponsor based on safety, PK, and pharmacodynamic measurements, along with the strength of antitumor activity signals observed.  Pharmacokinetics The half -life (t
1/2) of pembrolizumab is approximately 4 weeks and there is no indication of dose 
dependency or half-life in the three dose groups (1,3, and 10 mg/kg) (Investigator’s Brochure, 2014).  The long t
1/2 supports a dosing interval of every 2 or 3 weeks. 
 There was a dose -related increase in exposure from 1 to 10 mg/kg.  Serum concentrations of 
pembrolizumab were lower by a factor o f approximately 5 in patients receiving 2 mg/kg Q3W 
than in those receiving 10 mg/kg Q3W.  Steady- state trough concentrations were 20% greater in 
the patients receiving 10 mg/kg Q2W than in those receiving the same dose Q3W.  A population pharmacokinetic a nalysis has been performed using serum concentration time data 
from 476 patients. Within the resulting population PK model, clearance and volume parameters of pembrolizumab were found to be dependent on body weight. The relationship between 
clearance and b ody weight, with an allometric exponent of 0.59, is within the range observed for 
other antibodies and would support both body weight normalized dosing or a fixed dose across all body weights.  pembrolizumab  has been found to have a wide therapeutic range bas ed on the 
melanoma indication.  The population PK evaluation revealed that there was no significant impact of tumor burden on exposure. In addition, exposure was similar between the NSCLC and melanoma indications. Therefore, there are no anticipated changes in exposure between different indication settings.  
 The rationale for further exploration of 2 mg/kg and comparable doses of pembrolizumab  in 
solid tumors is based on: 1) similar efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab when dosed at either 2 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg Q3W in melanoma patients, 2) the flat exposure-response relationships of pembrolizumab for both efficacy and safety in the dose ranges of 2 mg/kg Q3W to 10 mg/kg Q3W, 3) the lack of effect of tumor burden or indication on distribution behavior of pembrolizumab (as assessed by the population PK model) and 4) the assumption that the 

NCI Protocol #:  
DF/HCC Protocol #:

10 dynamics of pembrolizumab target engagement will not vary meaningfully with tumor type.  
 
The choice of the 200 mg Q3W as an appropriate dose for the switch to fixed dosing is based on simulations performed using the population PK model of pembrolizumab showing that the fixed dose of 200 mg every 3 weeks will provide exposures that 1) are optim ally consistent with those 
obtained with the 2 mg/kg dose every 3 weeks, 2) will maintain individual patient exposures in the exposure range established in melanoma as associated with maximal efficacy response and 3) will maintain individual patients expos ure in the exposure range established in melanoma that are well 
tolerated and safe.  
A fixed dose regimen will simplify the dosing regimen to be more convenient for physicians and to reduce potential for dosing errors.  A fixed dosing scheme will also redu ce complexity in the 
logistical chain at treatment facilities and reduce wastage.  
 Anti-Drug Antibodies (ADA) Data 
The occurrence of ADA has been observed in less than 1% of the patients screened, indicating a low potential of pembrolizumab to elicit the f ormation of ADA.  No impact of ADA on 
pembrolizumab exposure has been observed.  Efficacy  
When treated with pembrolizumab monotherapy, the overall response rate (ORR) for ipilimumab (IPI) -treated patients with melanoma was 25%/27% according to the Response Evaluation 
Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)/investigator -assessed immune -related response criteria 
(irRC), respectively (Investigator’s Brochure, 2014).  The ORR for IPI-naïve patients with melanoma was 39%/43% by RECIST/investigator- assessed irRC, respe ctively.  The majority of 
responses were seen in patients with melanoma by 16 weeks of therapy; however, some responses have been reported after 24 weeks or more of therapy with pembrolizumab.  Responses can be delayed, and in some patients, a RECIST- defin ed progression followed by 
response has been observed.  The preliminary ORR for 38 patients with non- small cell lung cancer was 21%/24% by 
RECIST/investigator -assessed irRC, respectively (Investigator’s Brochure, 2014). 
 Pharmacodynamics/Biomarkers Pharmacodynamic data (IL -2 release assay) has suggested that peripheral target engagement is 
durable (>21 days).    PD-L1 is being investigated as a predictive biomarker for pembrolizumab treatment.  At the 15
th 
World Conference on Lung Cancer, Garon et al presented preliminary data on a subset of patients suggesting that higher levels of tumor PD -L1 expression are associated with increased 
clinical activity.
12  ORR by RECIST 1.1 occurred in 4 out of 7 patients with higher levels of PD-
L1 expression (57%, 95% CI 18-90%) versus 2 out of 22 patients with lower levels of PD- L1 
expression (9%, 95% CI 1- 29%).  These data are extremely preliminarily, and PD -L1 is not 
being used for patient selection.  Biomarkers to evaluate immune modulation and markers in the tumor microenvironment, such as

11 T-cell infiltration, the baseline expression of markers of T-cell suppression FoxP3 or the 
immunoregulatory enzyme incoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) in tumor biopsies, were 
associated with a high response rate in patients with advanced melanoma.13,14 
 Safety data The most frequent treatment -related adverse events (AEs) were fatigue, nausea, cough, pruritis, 
diarrhea, and rash (Investigator’s Brochure, 2014).  Most AEs were not considered serious.  The most commonly- reported immune -related AEs were rash, pruritis, vitiligo, hypothyroidism, 
arthralgia, diarrhea, and pneumonitis.  Important identified risks include: pneumonitis, thyroid disorders (hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism), colitis, diarrhea, hepatitis, nephritis, uveitis, rash/pruritis, and neuropathy.   2.3 
T-DM1  
 
T-DM1 mechanism of action  
T-DM1 is a promising anti-HER2 agent, with proven efficacy in the metastatic setting.  T- DM1 
is composed of: trastuzumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds to domain IV on the juxtamembrane region of the extracellular domain (ECD) of HER2 and inhibits tumor growth in 
vitro  and in vivo via several mechanisms ;
15-17 DM1, a potent anti-microtubule agent derived from 
maytansine; and SMCC, a thioether linker molecule used to conjugate DM1 to trastuzumab.  T-
DM1 retains all of the modes of action of trastuzumab, which include a binding affinity to the HER2 ECD that is comparable to trastuzumab, inhibition of HER2-ECD shedding, inhibition of the HER2 -activated PI3K/Akt signa ling pathway, and mediation of antibody- dependent cell -
mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC).
18  Linkage of a cytotoxic agent to highly specific monoclonal 
antibodies targeting tumor -specific and/or overexpressed tumor- associated antigens focuses the 
delivery of such agents to tumor cells, which creates a more favorable therapeutic window than could be achieved by their administration as free drugs, and may facilitate combinations with different agents.  After binding to HER2, T-DM1 undergoes receptor- mediated internalization, 
followed by intracellular release of DM1 and subsequent cytotoxicity.  Activation of cytotoxicity of the conjugate requires that it be internalized into the cell after binding to HER2.  The non-internalized conjugate remains inactive, thus limiting the systemic toxicity.  
 
T-DM1 clinical efficacy data  
In multiple clinical phase II and III studies, T-DM1 as a single agent has demonstrated robust and clinically meaningful activity, as well as favorable toxicity in patients with HER2+ metastatic breast cancer (MBC).  Two phase II studies —TDM4258g and TDM4374g— evaluated 
the safety and efficacy of T -DM1 administered at a dose of 3.6 mg/kg (maximum tolerated dose 
[MTD] in Phase I) every 3 weeks until progressive disease (PD) or unacceptable toxicity in 
HER2+ MBC who had progressed on previous HER2-directed therapy and conventional chemotherapy.
19,20  Patients enrolled onto study TDM4374g were specifically required to have 
received an antrhacycline, trastuzumab, a taxane, lapatinib, and capecitabine in the neoadjuvant, adjuvant, locally advanced or metastatic setting.  Additionally, patients must have been treated with two or more HER2- directed regimens in the locally advanced or metastatic setting, and 
must have progressed on their most recent treatment.

12  
The clinical activity of T -DM1 was similar in the two studies.  In Study  TDM4258g, on the basis 
of the final analysis approximately 12 months after the last patient was enrolled, the overall response rate (ORR) in efficacy evaluable patients was 38.9% (95% confidence interval [CI], 29.7%, 48.5%) by investigator and 26.9% (95% CI, 19.2%, and 35.8%) by independent review. The clinical benefit rate (CBR) (defined as complete response [CR], partial response [PR], or 
stable disease for > 6 months) was 46.3% by investigator assessment (95% CI, 36.7%, 56.2%) 
and 40.7% by independent review (95% CI, 31.8%, 50.6%). The median progression- free 
survival (PFS) was 4.6 months by both the investigators and the independent review facility 
(IRF) assessment. In Study TDM4374g, on the basis of clinical data collected through 1 January 2010, approximatel y 9 months after the last patient had enrolled, the ORR among all treated 
patients was 34.5% (95% CI, 26.1%, 43.9%) by IRF assessment and 32.7% (95% CI, 24.1%, 42.1%) by investigator assessment.  The CBR was 48.2% (95% CI, 38.8%, 57.9%) by IRF assessment a nd 46.4% (95% CI, 37.1%, 56.1%) by investigator assessment.  The median 
duration of response was not reached (95% CI, 4.6 months, not reached) by IRF assessment and 9.7 months (95% CI, 6.6 months, not reached) by investigator assessment. In this study population, there was a median PFS of 6.9 months (95% CI:   4.2, 9.5) as assessed by the IRF and 
5.5 months (95% CI:   4.1, 7.5) by investigator review. 
 The safety profile of T -DM1 was also similar between the two studies.  In  Study TDM4258g, the 
five most common adverse events (AEs) were fatigue (65.2%), nausea (50.9%), headache 
(40.2%), epistaxis (35.7%), and pyrexia (34.8%).  Most of these events were Grade 1− 2. The 
three most common Grade 3− 4 AEs observed in this trial were hypokalemia (8.9%), 
thrombocytopenia (TCP) (8.0%), and fatigue (4.5%).  In Study TDM4374g, a total of 49 patients (44.5%) experienced at least one Grade ≥ 3 AE. The three most common Grade ≥  3 adverse 
events (by Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities [MedDRA] preferred terms) were TC P 
(7.3%), fatigue (4.5%), and cellulitis (3.6%).  Serious adverse events (SAEs) were reported in 25 
patients (22.7%). No single SAE was reported in more than 4 patients. No Grade ≥  3 left 
ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD) events (symptomatic congestive heart failure [CHF] 
and/or left ventricular ejection fraction [LVEF] of < 40%) were reported in either study.  
 
In the randomized phase III EMILIA study, T-DM1 monotherapy proved superior to the approved regimen lapatinib/capecitabine in patients who had progressed on prior trastuzumab and taxane.
21  Median PFS was 9.6 months in the T-DM1 arm compared with 6.4 months in the 
capecitabine and lapatinib arm (HR = 0.65, 95% CI; 0.55 to 0.77; p <0.001), and median overall survival (OS) at the second interim analysis crossed the stopping boundary for efficacy (30.9 months vs. 25.1; HR = 0.68, 95% CI; 0.55 to 0.85; p <0.001). Overall, fewer Grade ≥ 3 adverse events were observed in the T -DM1 arm (40.8%) than in the lapatinib arm (57%). The most 
common Grade ≥  3 adverse events  with T -DM1  were thrombocytopenia (12.9%), elevated AST 
(4.3%) and ALT (2.9%), anemia (2.7%) and fatigue (2.4%).  Based on the EMILIA data, T- DM1 
was recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for patients with advanced HER2+ breast cancer that has progressed on trastuzumab-based therapy, with superior overall survival (OS) and a better adverse event profile compared to the lapatinib/capecitabine combination.

Rationale  
 Accumulating evidence suggests that the immune system plays an important role in control of HER2+ breast cancer, and works with HER2-targeted therapies to do so.  High levels of immune infiltrates are observed in HER2 -overexpressing breast cancers.  Recent studies suggest that 
monoclonal antibodies such as trastuzumab may stim ulate adaptive anti -tumor immunity.  Two 
studies in mice demonstrated that anti-HER2 antibody therapy required adaptive CD8-dependent immunity to mediate its optimal effect.
22,23  It is thought that trastuzumab activates toll- like 
receptor signaling, priming the release of interferon (IFN) and priming IFN -producing CD8+ T 
cells.  In addition, more recent data suggested that each 10% increase in tumor- infiltrating 
lymphocytes (TILs ) was associated with a significant decrease in distant recurrence in patients 
receiving adjuvant trastuzumab,24 further suggesting the importance of antitumor immunity in 
the HER2+ subset of breast cancer.  In HER2+ breast cancer patients, therefore, combining cytotoxic chemotherapy (which provokes tumor antigen recognition) with anti- HER2 
monoclonal antibodies (which stimulate adaptive immunity) and checkpoint inhibitors (which enhance adaptive antitumor immune responses by preventing T cell exhaustion) is an attractive, 
rational approach for maximizing the antitumor immune response to advance the treatment of 
HER2 -positive breast cancer.  
 Trastuzumab emtansine (T -DM1), as described above, is a novel antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) 
composed of trastuzumab (a humanized antibody directed against the extracellular region of HER2), DM1 (an anti-microtubule cytotoxic agent), and a linker molecule.  Pembrolizumab is a checkpoint inhibitor with promising clinical data in melanoma and non- small cell lung cancer, as 
discussed above, as well as preliminary efficacy data in triple negative breast cancer.
25  The 
combination of pembrolizumab with T- DM1 has the potential to concurrently: (1) stimulate 
tumor antigen recognition through use of a cytotoxic; (2) simulate adaptive immunity and ADCC through use of anti-HER2 antibody therapy; and (3) enhance the anti- tumor autoimmune 
response with an anti- PD-1 antibody.  The proposed study will explore the safety and efficacy of 
this combination in women with advanced HER2+ breast cancer.  
 2.5 
Correlative Studies Background  
 2.5.1 
Blood and Tissue Analysis  
There is growing evidence that signatures of tumor- associated immunologic activity are seen in 
breast cancer and are significant prognostic predictors, particularly in t riple negative breast 
cancer (TNBC) and HER2 -positive breast cancer.  Many different groups have demonstrated that 
the amount of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in a tumor specimen, commonly assessed simply by histological evaluation of a standard hematoxylin and eosin- stained slide by a trained 
pathologist, is a significant predictor of both response to therapy and overall disease outcomes in the neoadjuvant and adjuvant settings.
26-31  Recently, more in -depth methods of immunologic 
profiling are being explored in breast cancer, for example mRNA expression of immune-
NCI Protocol #:

14 activating and immunosuppressive factors, and these additional immune profiles also appear to 
have prognostic significance.27 
 However, the development of immune signatures in breast cancer that go beyond si mple 
histology is at a very early stage.  Additionally, much of the work done in this area has been in the adjuvant and neoadjuvant settings, with less known about the immunologic profile of metastatic disease.  Given the promise of immune -based therapies in other solid malignancies 
such as melanoma and non- small cell lung cancer, with preliminary data demonstrating activity 
of immune checkpoint inhibition in advanced breast cancer patients,
25,32 there is a great need to 
better characterize the immune profile of breast tumors across multiple disease subtypes, and at different points in the course of therapy.  The bulk of our correlative science in this trial focuses on characterizing a broad array of immune markers in metastatic HER2 -positive breast cancer, 
investigating whether those markers predict disease response to therapy, and exploring how markers change from the start T -DM1 plus pembrolizumab treatment to the time of development 
of progressive disease.  
 In melanoma, the solid malignancy currently at the forefront of understanding the anti-tumor immune response, investigation into expression of immune mediators in the peripheral blood is at an early phase.
33  As a correlative study to this trial, we will characterize the immune marker 
profile of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in enrolled breast cancer patients.  Additiona lly, given the demonstrated clinical significance of TILs in breast cancer specimens, 
we will investigate whether there is a peripheral marker whose level corresponds to TIL percentage.  Lastly, we will evaluate whether there is a correlation between chang es in PBMC 
immune profiles over the course of treatment, and disease response to therapy.  Evidence of a correlation would be of significant interest as it would suggest the potential presence of a predictive biomarker in the peripheral blood.   2.5.2 
Microbiome  Analysis  
  The gut microbiota has been recognized as a modulator of immune system development
44. 
Healthy individuals have microbial populations in their intestinal tract that vary markedly in composition
45,46.  The diversity of intestinal microbiota represents a significant challenge to the 
host’s immune defenses, which must balance immune tolerance of beneficial microbes with inflammatory responses against pathogens.  Alterations in the gut microbiota and their resulting interactions with intestinal epithelieum and the host immune system are associated with many disease, including cancer
47.  Recently, two preclinical studies provided to immune checkpoint 
inhibitors ( ICI), raising the possibility that stool microbiota could be used as biomarker 
predict ors of efficacy to immunotherapy48,49.  Interestingly, postmenopausal women with breast 
cancer have altered composition and low diversity of their gut microbiota compared to healthy controls
50. 
 Identification of biomarkers that predict response to ICI- based therapies can spare de novo  
resistant patients from the unnecessary risks of immune-related adverse events.  In addition, the identification of bacterial species associated with response could open new strategies to

15 maximize the clinical benefit of cancer immunotherapy through the modulation of gut 
microbiota.  
 This correlative project is made possible by collaboration with the BWH/Harvard Cohorts Biorepository and Microbiome Dx . Further details can be found in Section 9.   
 2.5.3 
Tumor Genomic Profile  
 
In addition to the immune microenvironment, intrinsic tumor factors may be associated with 
response to immune checkpoint inhibitors. Although some of the mechanisms related to de novo or acquired resistance to ICI have been recently described, including loss of function in beta -2- 
microglobulin or defects in the interferon signaling pathway [Gao et al. , 2016, Zaretsky  et al. , 
2016] , the knowledge of immune resistance remains largely unknown. Several gene/pathways 
have been described as possible candidates of having an immunosuppressive role in different 
advanced solid tumor, inc luding MYC amplification [Casey  et al. , 2016] , activation in WNT -β-
catenin pathway [Spranger  et al. , 2015] , activation in MAPK pathway, loss of PTEN [Li et al. , 
2016, Peng  et al. , 2016, George  et al. , 2017] . On the other hand, few possible biomarkers of 
response to ICI have emerged, including mutational load[ Snyder  et al. , 2014, Rizvi  et al. , 2015 ], 
tumor aneuploidy [Davoli  et al. , 2017] , mismatch repair defects [Le et al. , 2015] , and BRCA2 
mutation [Hugo  et al. , 2016] . Notably, there is no data on genomic mechanisms of de novo 
resistance to anti -PD-1 therapy in patients with breast cancer.  
Therefore, as a correlative study to this trial, we will to explore whether the number and/or 
type of mutations identified using a next generation sequencing (NGS) panel – OncoPanel - is 
correlated with patient outcomes (PFS, ORR , and OS). This tool is a cancer genomic assay to 
detect somatic mutations, copy number variations and structural variants in tumor DNA extracted 
from fresh, frozen or formalin -fixed paraffin -embedded samples. Th e OncoPanel assay surveys 
exonic DNA sequences of 447 cancer genes and 191 regions across 60 genes for rearrangement detection. DNA is isolated from tissue containing at least 20% tumor nuclei and analyzed by massively parallel sequencing using a solution -phase Agilent SureSelect hybrid capture kit and an 
Illumina HiSeq 2500 sequencer. The targeted NGS assay (OncoPanel) will be performed at the Center for Advanced Molecular Diagnostics (Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital). This assay has been extensively validated and is used as a CLIA -approved clinical 
molecular test in our institution without any additional sequencing assays to validate the findings [Wagle  et al. , 2012].

TREATMENT PLAN  
  5.1 
Treatment Regimen  
The study will be conducted as a dose de- escalation study, as the common toxicities of the two 
agents are not overlapping.  Each cycle will be 21 days in length.  Six patients will be entered at dose level 1 (Table 1), consisting of T-DM1 3.6 mg/kg IV every 21 days, in combination with 
pembrolizumab 200 mg IV every 21 days.  If one or fewer dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) are noted within the first six patients, this dose level will be declared the RP2D.  If two or more DLTs are found in the first 6 patients, then 6 additional patients will be entered at dose level -1 (Table 1).  If one or fewer DLTs are noted at dose level -1, then this will be declared the RP2D.  If two or more DLTs are noted at dose level -1, enrollment will be stopped.  No dose changes will be explored for pembrolizumab as it s toxicity  has not been found to be dose-dependent in 
other clinical contexts.  
 The DLT period is defined as 21 days from the first dose of therapy (i.e. the first cycle of 
therapy ).  All six patients enrolled to the dose level must complete the DLT period before 
additional patients can be enrolled.  Once the RP2D is declared, 15 eligible patients with metastatic HER2+ breast cancer will be entered into an expansion cohort.  Treatment will be administered on an outpati ent basis.  Reported adverse events and potential 
risks are described in Section 7.1.  Appropriate dose modifications are described in Section 6.  Details of the regimen are described in Table 2.  No investigational or commercial agents other than those de scribed below may be administered with the intent to treat the participant’s 
malignancy.

Agent Administration  
 5.3.1 
Pembrolizumab  
 Pembrolizumab will be administered by trained medical personnel at the investigational site.  Treatment compliance will be monitored through documentation of study treatment administration in the subject’s medical record.  
 Pembrolizumab will be administered in clinic on day  1 of each 3 -week cycle (+/ - 3 days).  It will 
be administered as a 30 minute IV infusion.  Sites should make every effort to target infusion timing to be as close to 30 minutes as possible.  However, given the variability of infusion pumps from site to site, a window of -5 minutes and +10 minutes is permitted (i.e., infusion time is 30 minutes: -5 min/+10 min).  
 Pembrolizumab should be administered prior to T-DM1 administration.  There should be no overlap in timing of the two administrations; however, there is no required observation period prior to beginning T- DM1 administration.  
 5.3.2 
T-DM1  
 
T-DM1 administration  
T-DM1 will be used as per the FDA label.  T -DM1 will be administered by trained medical 
personnel at the investigational site.  Treatment compliance will be monitored through 
documentation of study treatment administration in the subject’s medical record.  
 T-DM1 will be administered in clinic on day 1 of each 3- week cycle (+/ - 3 days).  The total Criteria to treat at day 1  of subsequent cycles : 
• Absolute neutrophil count >1000/μl  
• Platelets >75,000/μl  
• ALT and AST <3.0 x ULN in a patient wi th no documented liver metastases; 
ALT and AST <5.0 x ULN in a patient with documented liver metastases

23 dose of T -DM1  will be calculated according to institutional standards.  
 
The first infusion of T-DM1 will be administered over 90 minutes (+/- 10 minutes).  Infusions may be slowed or interrupted for patients experiencing infusion-associated symptoms. Following the initial dose, patients will be observ ed for at least 60  minutes for fever, chills, or 
other infusion- associated symptoms.  Subsequent doses of T-DM1 may be administered over 
30 minutes (+/- 10 minutes) with a 30 -minute post-infusion observation if the first infusion was 
well tolerated . Local health authority guidelines must be followed with regard to further 
observation and monitoring, if applicable.  Dose modifications for T- DM1 toxicity management 
are listed in Section 6, and Section 6, Table 6. 
 Premedication for nausea and infusion reactions are not commonly required but may be given at the investigator’s discretion. 
 
 5.4 
Definition of Dose -Limiting Toxicity  (DLT)

General Concomitant Medication and Supportive Care Guidelines  
 5.5.1 
Concomitant Medication Guidelines  
 Medications or vaccinations specifically prohibited in the exclusion criteria are not allowed during the ongoing trial.  If there is a clinical indication for one of these or other medications or vaccinations specifically prohibited during the trial, discontinuation from trial therapy or vaccination may be required.  The investigator should discuss any questions regarding this with the Principle Investigator .  
 
Acceptable Concomitant Medications  
All treatments that the investigator considers necessary for a  subject’s welfare may be 
administered at the discretion of the investigator in keeping with the community standards of medical care.  
Prohibited Concomitant Medications  
Participants should discontinue the following therapies 21 days prior to enrollment and must remain off them during protocol therapy: 
• Antineoplastic systemic chemotherapy or biological therapy  
• Immunotherapy not specified in this protocol 
• Chemotherapy not specified in this protocol 
• Biologic or targeted agents not specified in this protocol 
• Investigational agents other than pembrolizumab 
Participants should have completed radiation therapy 14 days prior to enrollment, if radiation therapy to a symptomatic solitary lesion or to the brain is required while on protocol therapy it 
may be allowed at the principle investigator’s discretion .   
NCI Protocol #:  
DF/HCC Protocol #:  
Protocol Version Date: 4/18/2019  
 
25 Participants  are prohibited from receiving the following therapies during the Screening and 
Treatment Phase of this trial: 
• Any systemically active oral, injected, or implanted hormonal method of contraception 
except for progesterone coated intrauterine devices (IUDs) that had been previously implanted.  
• Estrogen replacement therapy.  
• Live vaccines within 28 days prior to the first dose of trial treatment and while participating in the trial.   Examples of live vaccines include, but are not limited to, the 
following: measles, mumps, rubella, varicella/zoster, yellow fever, rabies, BCG, and typhoid vaccine.  
• Systemic glucocorticoids for any purpose other than to modulate symptoms from an adverse event of suspected immunologic etiology.  The use of physiologic doses of 
corticosteroids may be approved after consultation with the Sponsor. 
 
Subjects who, in the assessment by the investigator, require the use of any of the aforementioned 
treatments for clinical management should be removed from the trial.  Subjects may receive 
other medications that the investigator deems to be medically necessary.  
Concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole and itraconazole; see Appendix C) with T-DM1 should be avoided. An alternate medication with no or minimal potential to inhibit CYP3A4/5 should be considered. If a strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitor is co-administered with T -DM1, patients should be closely monitored for adverse reactions. 
There are no prohibited therapies during the Post- Treatment Follow -up Phase. 
5.5.2 
Contraception  
 Pembrolizumab may have adverse effects on a fetus in utero.  Furthermore, it is not known if pembrolizumab has transient adverse effects on the composition of sperm.    For this trial, male subjects will be considered to be of non-reproductive potential if they have azoospermia (whether due to having had a vasectomy or due to an underlying medical condition).    Female subjects will be considered of non- reproductive potential if they are either:  
(1) postmenopausal (defined as at least 12 months with no menses without an 
alternative medical cause; in women < 45 years of age not using hormonal 
contraception or hormonal replacement therapy a high follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the postmenopausa l range is required  to confirm a post -
menopausal state in women not using hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement therapy. In the absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, a FSH measurement is insufficient.);  
NCI Protocol #:  
DF/HCC Protocol #:  
Protocol Version Date: 4/18/2019  
 
26 OR  
(2) have had a hysterectomy and/or bilate ral oophorectomy, bilateral salpingectomy 
or bilateral tubal ligation/occlusion, at least 6 weeks prior to screening;  
OR  
(3) have a congenital or acquired condition that prevents childbearing. 
 
Female and male subjects of reproductive potential must agre e to practice abstinence ( if it is 
consistently employed as the subject’ s preferred and usual lifestyle; however, periodic abstinence 
(e.g., calendar, ovulation, sympto-thermal, post-ovulation methods, etc.) and withdrawal are not acceptable) from heterosexual activity or use acceptable contraception (as defined below) during heterosexual activity while receiving protocol therapy and up to 120 da ys after the last dose of 
study.  
 Acceptable methods of contraception are
‡: 
  
Single method (one of the following is acceptable):  
• intrauterine device (IUD)  
• vasectomy of a female subject’s male partner  
• contraceptive rod implanted into the skin 
  
Combination method (requires use of two of the following): 
• diaphragm with spermicide (cannot be used in conjunction with ce rvical 
cap/spermicide)  
• cervical cap with spermicide (nulliparous women only)   
• contraceptive sponge (nulliparous women only)  
• male condom or female condom (cannot be used together) 
• hormonal contraceptive: oral contraceptive pill (estrogen/progestin pill or  progestin-
only pill), contraceptive skin patch, vaginal contraceptive ring, or subcutaneous contraceptive injection  
  ‡If a contraceptive method listed above is restricted by local regulations/guidelines, then it does not qualify as an acceptable method of contraception for subjects participating at sites in this country/region.  
 Subjects should be informed that taking the study medication may involve unknown risks to the fetus (unborn baby) if pregnancy were to occur during the study.  In order to partici pate in the 
study subjects of childbearing potential must adhere to the contraception requirement (described above) from the day of study medication initiation (or 14 days prior to the initiation of study medication for oral contraception) and up to 120 da ys after the last dose of  protocol therapy.  If 
there is any question that a subject of childbearing potential will not reliably comply with the requirements for contraception, that subject should not be entered into the study.  5.5.3 
Supportive Care Guidelines – general medications  
 The following treatments are permitted throughout the duration of the study treatment phase and during follow-up: 
NCI Protocol #:  
DF/HCC Protocol #:  
Protocol Version Date: 4/18/2019  
 
27  
• Standard therapies for pre-existing medical conditions unless listed as prohibited therapy 
below. Any medication intended solely for supportive care (e.g., analgesics, anti-diarrheal, anti-depressants) may be used at the investigator’s discretion. Patients on anti-coagulant treatment should have their platelet count monitored closely during treatment with T -DM1. Anti emetics and anti -diarrheal medications should not be administered 
prophylactically before initial treatment with study drugs.  At the discretion of the investigator, prophylactic antiemetic and anti- diarrheal medication(s) may be used as per 
standard clinical practice before subsequent doses of study drugs. 
• Hematopoietic growth factors (e.g., G-CSF, granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating 
factor) may be used at investigator’s discretion for the primary prophylaxis and/or 
management of treatment -emergent n eutropenia and/or for secondary prophylaxis as per 
NCCN/European Society for Medical Oncology guidelines 
34,35 or local standard practice. 
However, treatment with granulocyte- colony stimulating factors will not permitted in 
cycle 1 unless the patient has febrile neutropenia and the physician considers its use as clinically indicated. It will be left to the treating physician choice from cycle 2.  
• Bisphosphonate or denosumab therapy to be used in accordance with the approved labeled indication and/or nationally recog nized treatment guidelines.  Participants already 
receiving bisphosphonate/denosumab at the time of study entry can continue the treatment. Participants with new bone metastases documented as part of study screening procedures may begin a bisphosphonate af ter study registration but before initiation of 
protocol therapy. 
• Anticoagulants - Anticoagulation with heparin, heparin derivatives, and/or warfarin may be given at the discretion of the treating physician. Coagulation parameters should be checked at leas t once monthly, or more frequently at discretion of treating physician.  
• Pain medications administered per standard clinical practice are acceptable while the patient is enrolled in the study.  
 
Patients who experience toxicities should be treated symptomatically as clinically indicated.  Medications that are considered necessary for the subject’s welfare and that are not expected to 
interfere with the evaluation of study treatment or be restricted  may be given at the discretion of 
the investigator.   Ancillary treatments will be given as medically indicated.  
 5.6 
Criteria for Taking a Participant Off Protocol Therapy  
 Duration of therapy will depend on individual response, evidence of disease progression and tolerance. In the absence of treatment delays due to ad verse event (s), treatment may continue 
until one of the following criteria applies:  
• Disease progression  – in any subject who showed first radiologic evidence of 
progressive disease (PD) by RECIST 1.1 (see Section 11.1.4) and is deemed  
clinically stable, it is at the discretion of the investigator to continue treating the subject until progression is confirmed at least 4 weeks from the date of the first radiologic evidence of PD.  Further details are described below.  
NCI Protocol #:  
DF/HCC Protocol #:  
Protocol Version Date: 4/18/2019  
 
28 • Participants  who have attained a confirmed complete response ( CR) that have been 
treated for at least 24 weeks with pembrolizumab and had at least two treatments with 
pembrolizumab beyond the date when the initial CR was declared.   Concurrent 
discontinuation of T- DM1 is at the discretion of the investigator.   Subjects who then 
experience radiographic disease progression may be eligible for up to one year of 
additional treatment with pembrolizumab via the Second Course Phase (see below) at 
the discretion of the investigator if no systemic cancer  treatment  other than T- DM1  
was administered since the last dose of pembrolizumab, the subject meets the safety 
parameters listed in the Inclusion/Exclusion criteria, and the trial is open.  Subjects will resume therapy at the same dose and schedule as at the time of initial 
discontinuation.  
• Intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment  
 
• Unacceptable adverse event(s)  
 
• Participant demonstrates an inability or unwillingness to comply with the medication regimen and/or documentation requirements  
 
• Participant decides to withdraw from the protocol therapy 
 
• General or  specific changes in the participant's condition render the participan t 
unacceptable for further treatment in t he judgment of the treating investigator 
  Participants  will be removed from the protocol therapy when any of the se criteria apply.  The 
reason for removal from protocol therapy, and the date the participant was rem oved, must be 
documented in the case report f orm (CRF)  and recorded in the clinical trials management system 
(OnCore). Alternative care options will be discussed with the participant.  
 In the event of unusual or life- threatening complications, treating investigators must immediately 
notify the Overall PI,  Sara Tolaney, MD MPH at   
 Confirmat
ion of Progressive Disease 
 Pembrolizumab, like other immunotherapeutic agents, may produce antitumor effects b y 
potentiating endogenous cancer-specific immune responses. The r espons e patterns seen with 
such an approach may extend beyond the typical time course of image responses seen with cytotoxic  agents, and can manifest as a clinical response after an initial increase in tumor burden 
or even the appearance of new lesions.  
 For any  subject who showed first radiologic evidence of progressive disease (PD) by RECIST 
1.1 (see Section 11.1.4) and is deemed  clinically stable, it is at the discretion of the investigator 
to continue treating the subject until progression is confirmed at least 4 weeks from the date of the first radiologic evidence of PD. If progression is confirmed, the subject will be discontinued from study treatment. Otherwise, the  subject will continue treatment and radiographic scans. Any 

NCI Protocol #:  
DF/HCC Protocol #:  
Protocol Version Date: 4/18/2019  
 
29 subject who had initial radiologic progression and is deemed clinically unstable should be 
discontinued from both study drugs and no subsequent scan for confirmation is required.  Further details are as below:  
 For purposes of PFS assessment on this trial, in addition to radiographic assessment of tumor response or progression, the investigator should taking into account the clinical condition/stability of subjects.  
 Clinically stable is defined by the following criteria: 
o Absence of signs and symptoms (including worsening of labor atory values) 
indicating  disease progression  
o No decline in ECOG performance status 
o Absence of rapid progression of disease 
o Absence of progressive tumor(s) at critical anatomical sites (eg, cord compression) requiring urgent alternative medical intervention  
 Any subject who showed first radiologic evidence of progressive disease and is deemed Clinically unstable should be discontinued from both study drugs and is not required to have repeat imaging for confirmation.  
 For a clinically stable subject with fir st radiologic evidence of progressive disease 
(ie,unconfirmed progression of disease), it is at the discretion of the investigator to continue treating the subject with the assigned treatment per protocol until progression of disease is  
confirmed on a subs equent scan at least 4 weeks later . If progression is not confirmed on the 
subsequent scan, the subject should continue to receive study treatment and have radiographic scans performed every 6 weeks if the patient has been on study for less than 24 weeks, or every 9 
weeks  for patients who have been on study greater than 24 weeks to monitor disease status. If 
radiologic progression is confirmed by subsequent scans, then the subject will be discontinued from  study treatment. Exceptions may be considered to continue treatment in the presence of  
clinically stable or improved condition only after consultation with the principal  investigator . 
  Second Course Phase (Retreatment Period)
 
 Subjects who stop pembrolizumab for CR as described may be eligible for up to one year of 
additional pembrolizumab therapy if they progress after stopping study treatment.  This retreatment is termed the Second Course Phase of this study and is only available if the study remains open and the subject meets the following conditions:  
• Stopped initial treatment with pembrolizumab after attaining an investigator -determined 
confirmed CR according to RECIST 1.1, and: 
 was treated for at least 24 weeks with pembrolizumab  before discontinuing 
therapy  
NCI Protocol #:  
DF/HCC Protocol #:  
Protocol Version Date: 4/18/2019  
 
30  received at least two treatments with pembrolizumab beyond the date when the 
initial CR was declared  
AND  
 
• experienced an investigator -determined confirmed radiographic disease progression after 
stopping their initial treatment with pembrolizumab 
• did not receive any anti -cancer treatment  other than T -DM1  since the last dose of 
pembrolizumab 
• meets all other study inclusion/exclusion criteria, as per Section 3.  
Subjects who restart treatment will be retreated at the same dose and dose interval as when they 
last received pembrolizumab.  Treatment w ill be administered for up to one additional year. 
Visit requirements are as outlined for subjects on the initial treatment phase of the trial, in the expansion cohort.  Resumption of T-DM1 concurrent with pembrolizumab is at the discretion of the investig ator. 
 
 
5.7 Duration of Follow Up  
 All participants  will be followed for overall survival.   
Follow-up for vital status will be accomplished by annual review of the medical record , 
records/phone calls to outside providers or phone calls to the pati ent until death is documented. 
 In patients who come off trial for a reason other than progressive disease, scans should be performed every 6 weeks (if the patient is within 24 weeks of initiation of study treatment) or every 9 weeks (if the patient is greater than 24  weeks from initiation of study treatment) to 
evaluate for disease progression.  
 Participants removed from protocol therapy for unacceptable adverse event (s) will be followed 
until resolution or stabilization of the adverse event.  5.8 
Criteria for Taking a Participant Off Study  
 Participants will be removed from study when any of the following criteria apply: 
• Lost to follow-up 
• Withdrawal of consent for data submission 
• Death  
 The reason for taking a participant off study, and the date the participant was rem oved, must be 
documented in the case report f orm (CRF)  and in  OnCore.

31 6. DOSING DELAYS/DOSE M ODIFICATIONS   
 
Dose delays and modifications will be made as indicated in the following table(s). The descriptions and grading scales found in the revised NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0 will be utilized for dose delays and dose modifications. A copy of the CTCAE version 4.0 can be downloaded from the CTEP website  http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm
.  
 If there are dosing delays for any reason, all study assessments are to be delayed in the same fashion, such that scans and other assessments occur in conjunction with cycles of treatment.  
 6.1 
Management of toxicities attributable to pembrolizumab  
 There are two types of uncommon toxicity that have been previously described in patients on both single agent pembrolizumab and single agent T-DM1: (1) hepatotox icity, specifically 
manifesting as elevated AST, ALT, or total bilirubin; and (2) pneumonitis.  Dose modifications for these toxicities are addressed separately in Section 6.3.  
 For toxicities likely attributable to pembrolizumab alone, concurrent holding of T- DM1  is at the 
discretion of the treating physician.  
 Adverse events (both non- serious and serious) associated with pembrolizumab exposure may 
represent an immunologic etiology.  These adverse events may occur shortly after the first dose or several months af ter the last dose of treatment.  Pembrolizumab must be withheld for drug-related  
toxicities  and severe or life- threatening AEs as per Table 4 below.

Adverse Event List for Pembrolizumab  
 
In the pembrolizumab monotherapy trials (P001/P002, P012, P013, and P028, plus the P011 monotherapy arm), the overall incidence of AEs ranged from 83.0% (73 of 88 subjects in P012) to 100% (10 of 10 subjects in P011). The most commonly reported AEs included fatigue, diarrhea, decreased appetite, nausea, and anemia. The incidence of drug –related AEs (DRAEs) 
ranged from 39.8% (35 of 88 subjects in P013) to 80.0% (8 of 10 subjects in P011). The most commonly reported DRAEs across all studies were nausea, fati gue, and diarrhea. The incidence 
of Grade 3 -5 DRAEs across studies ranged from 6.8% (6 of 88 in P013) to 12.0% (187 of 1562 
subjects) in P001/P002. The most commonly reported Grade 3- 5 DRAEs were anemia, alanine 
aminotransferase elevation, and aspartate aminotransferase elevation . Most subjects who 
experienced an AE continued in the study, with the incidence of AEs leading to discontinuation ranging from 1.9% (8 of 430 subjects in P028) to 12.3% (192 of 1562 subjects in P001/P002). The majority of AEs leadi ng to discontinuation were not considered drug related. 
Discontinuations due to a DRAE were infrequent and ranged from 0% (no subjects in P011) to 4.5% (4 of 88 subjects in P013). The most commonly reported DRAEs leading to discontinuation were pneumonitis , alanine aminotransferase elevation, and aspartate aminotransferase elevation .

43 7.1.1.2 Adverse Event List (s) for T-DM1  
 
Identified and potential risks of treatment with T- DM1 are based on all available nonclinical 
and clinical data relating to T -DM1 as well as clinical toxicities related to its components 
(trastuzumab and maytansine), in addition to other DM1- containing ADC s.   
 Pulmonary toxicity, hepatotoxicity, cardiac toxicity (left ventricular dysfunction), infusion -
related reaction/hypersensitivity, thrombocytopenia (including thrombocytopenia associated with severe hemorrhage), and peripheral neuropathy are important identified risks with T -DM1 
and are detailed in the subsections below.  Fetal harm and impaired fertility are important potential risks with T -DM1. Guidance on dose modifications are provided in Section 6. 
 Please refer to the Investigator’s Brochure for a  full description of the T- DM1 safety profile, 
warnings, precautions, and guidance.  
 Pulmonary Toxicity Cases of interstitial lung disease (ILD), including pneumonitis, some leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome or fatal outcome, have been reporte d in clinical trials with T -
DM1.  Signs and symptoms include dyspnea, cough, fatigue, and pulmonary infiltrates.  These events may or may not occur as sequelae of infusion reactions.  Patients with dyspnea at rest as 
a result of complications of advanced m alignancy and/or comorbidities may be at increased risk 
of pulmonary events.  Treatment has included administration of steroids and oxygen, as well as 
study drug discontinuation.   Hepatotoxicity Hepatotoxicity, predominantly in the form of asymptomatic increases in the concentrations of 
serum transaminases (Grade 1 −4 transaminitis), has been observed in patients treated  with T -
DM1.  Transaminase elevations were generally transient with peak elevation at Day 8 after 
therapy administration and subsequent r ecovery to Grade 1 or less prior to the next cycle.  The 
incidence of increased AST was substantially higher than that for ALT.  A cumulative effect of T-DM1 on transaminases has been observed:  the proportion of patients with Grade 1 or 2 
elevated transam inases increases with successive cycles; however, no increase in the proportion 
of Grade 3 abnormalities over time was observed.  The majority of patients with elevated transaminases improved to Grade 1 or normal within 30 days of the last dose of T- DM1.  
 Rare cases of severe hepatotoxicity, including death due to drug -induced liver injury (DILI) and 
associated hepatic encephalopathy, have been observed in patients treated with T -DM1.  While 
there is evidence of drug induced liver toxicity in patients treated with T -DM1, its potential to 
cause acute severe liver injury with clinically meaningful changes in liver function is unclear, as the observed cases may have been confounded by concomitant medications with known hepatotoxic potential and/or underlying conditions.  A contributory role of T -DM1 in these 
cases cannot be excluded  so acute severe liver injury (Hy’s law) remains an important potential 
risk with T- DM1.  A Hy’s law case has the following components:  
 
NCI Protocol #:  
DF/HCC Protocol #:  
Protocol Version Date: 4/18/2019  
 
44 1. Aminotransferase enzymes are greater than 3  × ULN with concurrent 
elevation of serum TBILI to  > 2 × ULN, without initial findings of 
cholestasis (elevated serum alkaline phosphatase).  
2. No other reason can be found to explain the combination of increased 
aminotransferases and serum TBILI, such as viral hepatitis A, B, or C; 
preexisting or acute liver disease; or another drug capable of causing the observed injury.  
3. Gross jaundice, clinical disability, or the need for hospital care and should be at least probably drug -induced (by T -DM1).  
 
Cases of nodular regenerative hyperplasia (NRH) of the liver have been identified from liver 
biopsies in patients treated with T -DM1 and presenting with signs and symptoms of portal 
hypertension.  NRH is a rare liver condition characterized by widespread benign transformat ion 
of hepatic parenchyma into small regenerative nodules; NRH may lead to non -cirrhotic portal 
hypertension and also may be fatal.
36  NRH  should be considered in patients who develop 
clinical symptoms of portal hypertension and/or a cirrhosis -like pattern seen on CT scan of the 
liver but with normal transaminases and no other manifestations of cirrhosis or liver failure following long- term treatment with T -DM1.  Diagnosis of NRH can only be confirmed by 
histopathology.  
 Cardiac Toxicity  
Patients treated with T -DM1 are at increased risk of developing left ventricular dysfunction.  
LVEF  < 40% has been observed in patients treated with T -DM1.   
 Infusion- Related Reactions  (IRRs)/Hypersensitivity  
Infusion -related reactions (anaphylactoid/cytokine release reactions) and hypersensitivity 
(anaphylactic/allergic reactions) may occur with the administration of monoclonal antibodies and have been repor ted with T -DM1.  Treatment with T-DM1 has not been studied in patients 
who had trastuzumab permanently discontinued due to an IRR/hypersensitivity; treatment with T-DM1 is not recommended for these patients.   
 Infusion -related reactions (IRRs), characteri zed by one or more of the following symptoms-
flushing, chills, pyrexia, dyspnea, hypotension, wheezing, bronchospasm, and tachycardia- have 
been reported in clinical trials of T -DM1.  In general, these symptoms were not severe.  In most 
patients, these reac tions resolved over the course of several hours to a day after the infusion was 
terminated.  Serious hypersensitivity (anaphylactic -like reactions) has been observed in clinical 
trials of T -DM1.   
 Patients will be observed closely for infusion related/hyp ersensitivity reactions during and after 
each T -DM1 infusion as detailed in Section 5.3.2.  Pre -medication is allowed according to 
standard practice guidelines.  In the event of a true hypersensitivity reaction (in which severity of reaction increases with  subsequent infusions), T-DM1 treatment must be permanently 
discontinued.  Thrombocytopenia Thrombocytopenia, or decreased platelet count, was reported in patients in clinical trials of T -

45 DM1.  The majority of these patients had Grade 1 or 2 events ( ≥ 50,000/mm3), with the nadir 
occurring by Day 8 and generally improving to Grade 0 or  1 (≥ 75,000/mm3) by the next 
scheduled dose.  In clinical trials, the incidence and severity of thrombocytopenia were highe r 
in Asian patients.  In Study TDM4370g, the in cidence of thrombocytopenia in Asian patients 
was higher (52.5%) compared with the overall population (30.4%).  However, the incidence rate 
of Grade  ≥ 2 hemorrhage did not increase in Asian pat ients compared to the overall population. 
Rare cases of bleedin g events with a fatal outcome have been observed.  C ases of severe 
hemorrhagic events, including central nervous system hemorrhage, have been reported in 
clinical trials with T -DM1.  In some of the observed cases the patients were also receiving anti-
coagu lation therapy.  Patients on anti -coagulant treatment have to be monitored closely during 
treatment with T -DM1.  Platelet counts will need to be monitored prior to each T- DM1 dose.   
 Peripheral neuropathy  Peripheral neuropathy, mainly Grade 1 and predominantly sensory, has been reported in clinical trials of T -DM1.  These events were most apparent in patients with preexisting neuropathy. 
There have been no serious events of neuropathy, but there has been 1 patient to date who experienced a Grade 3 peripheral neuropathy. Once the AE resolved, the patient continued on study drug. One additional patient required a dose reduction for a Grade 2 peripheral neuropathy. Patients should be clinically monitored on an ongoing basis for signs/symptoms of neurotoxicity .

of the criteria is to specify a threshold of abnormal hepatic tests that may req uire an 
additional evaluation for an underlying etiology.  
 
7.6.2 Definition of an Overdose of Pembrolizumab for This Protocol and Reporting of Overdose to  
 For purposes of this trial, an overdose of pembrolizumab will be defined as any dose of 1,000 mg 
or greater.  No specific information is available on the treatment of overdose of pembrolizumab. 
Appropriate supportive treatment should be provided if clinically indicated. In the event of overdose, the subject should be observed closely for signs of toxicity.  Appropriate supportive treatment should be provided if clinically indicated.  If an adverse event(s)  is associated with (“results from”) the overdose of a product , the 
adverse event(s) is reported as a serious adverse even t, even if no other seriousness criteria are 
met. 
 If a dose of ’s product meeting the protocol definition of overdose is taken without any 
associated clinical symptoms or abnormal laboratory results, the overdose is reported as a non-serious Event of Clinical Interest (ECI), using the terminology “accidental or intentional overdose without adverse effect.” 
 
All reports of overdose with and without an adverse event must be reported within 24 hours to the Sponsor and within 2 working days hours to .  
 
  7.6.3 
Reporting of Pregnancy and Lactation to  
 
Although pregnancy and lactation are not considered adverse events, it is the responsibility of investigators or their designees to report any pregnancy or lactation in a subject (spontaneously reported to them) that occurs during the trial.  
Pregnancies and lactations that occur after the consent form is signed but before treatment allocation/randomization must be reported by the investigator if they cause the subject to be excluded from the trial, or are the result of a protocol -specified intervention, including but not 
limited to washout or discontinuation of usual therapy, diet, placebo treatment or a procedure.   
Pregnancies and lactations that occur from the time of treatment allocation/randomization 
through 120 days following cessation of Sponsor’s product, or 30 days following cessation of 
treatment if the subject initiates new anticancer therapy, whichever is earlier, must be reported by the investigator.  All reported pregnancies must be followed to the completion/termination of 
the pregnancy. Pregnancy outcomes of spontaneous abortion, missed abortion, benign hydatidiform mole, blighted ovum, fetal death, intrauterine death, miscarriage and stillbirth must 
be reported as serious events (Important Medical Events). If the pregnancy continues to term, the outcome (health of infant) must also be reported. 
Such events must be reported within 24 hours to the Sponsor and within 2 working days to

T-DM1  
Please refer to the Investigator’s Brochure for detailed agent information, and to the FDA label 
for additional information.  8.2.1 
Formulation , Preparation, and Storage  
 
Trastuzumab -MCC -DM1 (trastuzumab emtansine, T -DM1) is provided as a single -use 
lyophilized formulation in a colorless 20- mL Type I glass vial closed by means of a 
FluroTec- coated stopper and an overseal with flip- off cap.  Upon receipt of T -DM1 vials 
should be refrigerated at 2°C –8°C. All vials of T -DM1 should be handled by appropriately 
trained site s taff wearing gloves and visually inspected upon receipt to ensure they are 
intact without exterior contamination. Drug from any vials that appear abnormal upon inspection should not be administered to patients.  The lyophilized product should be reconstituted using Sterile Water for Injection (SWFI).  Using a new syringe, 8mL SWFI should be added to the vial and the vial swirled gently until the product is completely dissolved. The vial should not be shaken.  The resulting product contains 20 mg/mL T -DM1, 10 mM sodium succinate, pH 5.0, 60 mg/mL sucrose, 
and 0.02% (w/v) polysorbate 20. Each 20 mL vial contains enough T -DM1 to allow 
delivery of 160 mg T -DM1.  The reconstituted product contains no preservative and is 
intended for single use only. The vial should be inspected to ensure the reconstituted product is a clear colorless solution, and is free of particulates before proceeding.  Drug from any vial that appears abnormal upon inspection should not be administered to patients.  Using a new syringe, the in dicated volume of T -DM1 solution should be removed from the 
vial(s) and added to the IV bag containing at least 250 mL of 0.45% sodium chloride (preferred) or 0.9% sodium chloride injection and gently inverted to mix the solution.  A 0.22 micron non-protei n adsorptive polyethersulfone (PES) in- line filter is recommended 
when using 0.45% sodium chloride and required when using 0.9% sodium chloride injection.  The solution of T-DM1 should not be shaken.   The solution of T -DM1 for infusion should be used immediately.  If not used immediately, 
storage times should not be longer than 24 hours at 2°C−8°C (36°F−46°F) for solutions of

9. BIOMARKER, CORRELATIVE, AND SPECIAL STUDIES  
 All patients will be asked to provide archival tumor tissue (either paraffin blocks or 15 unstained slides , ideally 4 micron thickness).  However, if archival tissue is not available or not evaluable, 
that will not be a basis to exclude the patient from any portion of the trial or the planned analysis.  Archival tissue will be used for immune profiling assays to ascertain baseline values in patients who choose not to undergo baseline research fresh tissue biopsy (in the dose de- escalation 
cohort) or in whom there is insufficient tissue or failed testing  of any of the planned assays from 
baseline fresh tissue biopsy.  A baseline research biopsy prior to study therapy is required in the expansion cohort of this trial, and optional in the dose de-escalation cohort.  We plan to use baseline biopsy tissue to perform a number of immune profiling assays. On baseline tumor biopsies, we will perform characterization based on histology (TILs), protein expression, and mRNA expression.    An optional research  biopsy after 6 weeks on protocol therapy will be collected for patients who 
consent and have biopsy accessible tumor.  These biopsies will undergo the same characterization testing as described for baseline biopsies .  
 Serial  blood draws for correlative science are required on this trial; blood draws will be obtained 
every 3 weeks on treatment days, prior to the infusion of study drugs, at the end-of- treatment 
visit in patients who go off study for progressive dis ease, and all efforts will be made to obtain a 
sample  at the time of progressive disease from participants who went off study for anything other 
than progressive disease.  We will perform  flow cytometry on these samples to characterize 
protein expression of immune mediators .  Circulating free DNA will be assessed as well.    
 If participants agree, a portion of these specimens will be banked for possible future genomic 
analysis, and other further testing.  All patients will additionally be asked to provide a  stool sample at three separate timepoints: 
prior to treatment, during treatment, and at the time of disease progression. A fourth collection may be requested from patients who experience grade ≥ 2 diarrhea after discussion with the PI. This collection is not required, but is strongly encouraged. These samples will be analyzed for 
microbiota content. Please refer to the separate laboratory manual for stool details including specific collection, processing, and shipping instructions.

the-art fresh -frozen sample-collection protocol.  Patients will be asked to provide samples at the 
following timepoints: 
 
• Baseline  
• After two cycles of therapy  
• At the time of disease progression  
• Optional collection at the time of grade ≥ 2 diarrhea 
 Most kits will be provided to the patients at their clinic visits. If the study team is unable to provide the kits to the patients in clinic, they may be mailed to patients by members of the study team. All kits will contain a questionnaire for patients to complete and return with their samples regarding timing and conditions surrounding their stool sample.   Please refer  to the separate lab manual for collection and processing instructions. 
 Samples will be stored at the BWH/Harvard Cohorts Repository and will be shipped in batches

Hypotheses for correlative objectives  
 
• We hypothesize that all breast tumors can be placed in a baseline category of general “immune activity” level based on histologic, protein- based, and genomic analyses.  
• We hypothesize that breast tumors with a higher level of “immune activity” at baseline, 
as assessed by the mentioned analyses, will have a higher likelihood of responding to 
treatment with T -DM1 plus pembrolizumab. 
• We hypothesize that tumors with a more significant change in “immune activity” over the course of 6 weeks of therapy with T-DM1 plus pembrolizumab will have a higher likelihood of benefitting from the treatment.  
• We hypothesize that the immune marker profile in the peripheral blood will change over the course of T-DM1 plus pembrolizumab therapy. 
• We hypothesize that a larger increase in markers of immune activity in the peripheral blood will correlate with a better disease response as assessed on concurrent restaging scans  and in terms of best radiographic response at any time on trial. 
• We hypothesize that an immune marker or composite of markers in the peripheral blood at baseline will correspond to TIL percentage in baseline tumor biopsies. 
• We hypothesize that the structure and function of the gut microbiome differs among patients with breast cancer.  
• We hypothesize that the structure and function of the gut microbiome before starting 
pembrolizumab and T- DM1  can be predictive of efficacy of this therapy, with a greater 
microbial diversity, estimated by Shannon index, being predictive of efficacy. 
• We hypothesize that the structure and function of gut microbiome changes in response 
pembrolizumab-based therapy and can predict the likelihood of response to pembrolizumab plus T- DM1 . 
• We hypothesize that the abundance and functional profile of specific gut bacteria is associated with response to pembrolizumab plus T- DM1 .

Planned assays for correlative objectives  
 All of the below- mentioned analyses m ay be altered based on novel developments in the field of 
cancer immune profiling at the time of correlative science.  Additional markers or alternative technologies (based on scientific developments and/or novel technologies) may also be used, to explore potential prognostic or predictive candidate markers/panels or markers related to 
treatment benefit and/or safety, to improve diagnostic tests, or to understand breast cancer

60 biology. Planned collaborators include: Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, The Broad I nstitute of 
MIT, Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Beth Israel Deaconnes s 
Medical Center,  Adaptive Technologies,  and Microbiome Dx. Any samples or data shared with 
collaborators external to the study team will not contain any PHI or ide ntifying information. See 
section 12.4 for more information.  
 9.6.1 
Tumor infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) percentage and determination of lymphocyte predominant breast 
cancer (LPBC)  
 
Paraffinized, hematoxylin and eosin- stained slides taken from two tissue planes will be derived 
from each biopsy and will be reviewed by certified pathologists.  The extent of lymphocytic infiltrate in tumor tissue will be assessed  and stromal TIL percentage will be determined.  More 
detailed guidelines for the quantification of stromal TILs in breast cancer can be found in the recommendations from the International TILs Working Group 2014.
31 
 After assessment of the TIL percentage, the specimen may be categorized as lymphocyte predominant breast cancer (LPBC), defined as a tumor that contains >60% stromal lymphocytes, or non- LPBC.  
 9.6.2 
Immunohistochemistry  
 Tissue will be collected and fixed by 10% neutral buffered formalin overnight, dehydrated, and paraffin embedded.  Four micrometer-thick sections will be cut.  The paraffin blocks and unstained slides will be stored at room temperature.  All immunohistochemical staining will be performed in the Center for Immuno-Oncology Pathology Core at Dana- Farber/Harvard Cancer 
Center (DF/HCC) Specialized Histopathology Core.   Formalin fixed -paraffin embedded (FFPE) tumor slides will be prepared and H&E stained for 
assessment of TIL in pre- and post- treatment tumor samples.  To identify subsets of different 
immune populations (effector/memory CD8 cells, T regulatory cells, dendritic cells, tumor associated macrophages, and Tie- 2 expressing m onocytes (TEM)), immunohistochemical (IHC) 
staining will be performed on FFPE tumor slices using some or all of the following antibodies: Core set: CD8, PD-1, PD-L1, PD- L2 
Others: CD3, CD4, CD25, FoxP3, Indoleamine 2,3 deoxygenase-1 (IDO1), CD11c, CD83, CD86, CD56, CD14, CD16, Tie2 (See also Appendix E) 
 Chen et al
37 describe a semi -quantitative scoring method, which is in accordance with typical 
biomarker scoring in anatomic and surgical pathology.  Briefly, staining is scored according to intensity (0= no staining, 1=weak staining, 2=moderate staining, 3=strong staining), staining 
patter (M=predominantly cell membrane; C=predominantly cell cytoplasm), and the percentage of cells showing positive staining (0 -100%).  The semi-quantitative scoring is performed for: 1) 
the neoplastic tumor cells and 2) the non- neoplastic infiltrating immune cells.  Significant 
discordant results have been rare during case evaluations.
37 
 It should be noted that the above staining protocols are based on standard methods used at the time of protocol writing.  It is possible that at the time protein expression assays are conducted,

61 novel and improved methods for staining will exist.  In this case, we plan to use the best 
available, best validated experimental method available at the time.  
 9.6.3 
Flow cytometry, genomic analysis  of biopsy stissue  
 TILs will be isolated from the biopsy specimen and assessed by surface staining.   Messenger RNA (mRNA) expression  within tumor biopsy specimens will be assessed using the 
most current and informative methodologies at the time that correlative science is performed on all specimens.  NanoString signatures and comprehensive RNA sequencing may be used.  Potential genes of interest, based on prior immune profiling of breast tumors,
27 include CXCL9, 
CCL5, CD8ACD80, CXCL13, IGKC, CD21, IDO1, PD-1, PD-L1, PD-L2, CTLA4, and FOXP3.  Additional DNA analysis, for example to assess mutation al load and neoantigen burden, may 
also be performed.  
 9.6.4 
Analysis of PBMCs  
 PBMCs will be and used to assess immune cell populations by flow cytometry.   9.6.5 
Analysis of cell -free DNA  
 Blood will be collected at baseline, restaging visits and at time of progression for evaluation of cell-free DNA (cfDNA).  The cfDNA will be banked in the DF/HCC Clinical Trials Core 
laboratory for future research purposes.  The banked samples will be used to analyze DNA, RNA and protein in future studies.   9.6.6 
Analysis of DNA extraction from stool samples  
 Microbial DNA is extracted using the Mag -Bind Universal Pathogen DNA Kit (Omega Bio -
Tek). Briefly, 250 mg of the specimen is transferred to a deep- well pla te for bead beating 
followed by DNA precipitation and purification following the manufacturer’s instructions. Finally, DNA is eluted in 100 uls of Elution Buffer and stored at -80°C until further use. 16S sequencing libraries are generated by amplifying the v3 -v4 hypervariable regions of the 16S 
gene in a polymerase chain reaction using primers F341and R785. Resulting amplicons are tagged with unique molecular barcodes that are later used to demultiplex sequencing reads into individual sample buckets. Libraries are loaded on a MiSeq flowcell and sequenced following Illumina’s loading instructions. Sequence data are retrieved from the instrument by converting base call format files into fastq files for data processing purposes.  
 
MicrobiomeDX uses BacPro™, a proprietary algorithm, to inspect and validate sequencing files by employing demultiplexing, trimming, merging, and quality filtering steps. Paired sequencing reads are merged using an overlap of 25 bp allowing for 10 base mismatches. Merged sequences are dereplicated and clustered in a de-novo fashion using VSEARCH, while filtering out sequence chimeras and singletons. Representative sequences from each cluster are mapped against the SILVA database at 99% sequence identity to obtain accurate taxonomic classifications and relative abundances. In parallel, feature tables are constructed to derive alpha 
NCI Protocol #:  
DF/HCC Protocol #:  
Protocol Version Date: 4/18/2019  
 
62 diversity indices, and distance matrices are built to derive beta diversity indices. The BacProTM 
pipeline generates a comprehensive report that includes alpha diversity scores describing 
community richness and evenness, taxonomic composition with relative abundances, and beta diversity metrics to determine the in -between sample differences based on the bacterial 
communities identified.  
  9.6.7 
Shotgun sequencing and  metabolic pathway reconstruction of stool samples  
 Stool samples from patients included in the trial will be subjected to whole genome shotgun sequencing. Libraries will be constructed with Illumina barcodes from the TruSeq DNA Sample Prep kit (Illumina) and reagents from KAPA Library Preparation kit (Kapa Biosystems), and 
then sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq platform using 2_250 nucleotide paired-end sequencing, according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Sequencing reads will be converted into relative abundances of microbial metabolic modules using HUMAnN35, the Human Microbiome Project metabolic reconstruction pipeline and mapped to the KEGG36. Relative species abundances will be calculated by the MetaPhlAn pipeline37.

10. STUDY CALENDAR  
 
Baseline evaluations are to be conducted within 14  days  prior to start of protocol therapy (unless 
otherwise specified ).  If these screening assessments occur within 3 days before start of study 
treatment, then they may serve as the baseline Cycle 1 Day 1 values.  Scans must be done within 
28 days  prior to the start of therapy. 
 
As detailed in the Study Calendar, a negative pregnancy test in women of child- bearing potential 
must be documented within 7 days before the first dose of study medication.  A baseline tumor biopsy, obtained within 7 days  before starting protocol therapy, is also required 
in patients in the expansion cohort, and optional in patients in the dose de- escalation cohort.  
 In the event that the participant ’s condition is deteriorating, laboratory evaluations should be 
repeated within 48 hours prior to initiation of the next cycle of therapy.  
Assessments mu st be performed prior to administration of any study agent. Study assessments 
and agents should be administered within + 3 days of the protocol-specified date, unless 
otherwise noted.

Day 1.  
c. COMP should include:  sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, BUN, serum creatinine, glucose, calcium, albumin, total 
protein, alkaline phosphatase, ALT, AST, total bilirubin (NOTE: the frequency of checking magnesium  and phosphorus  
levels is left up to the treating provider)  
d. Coagulation Panel: PT /INR and PTT  
e. Hepatitis B surface Antibody, Hepatitis B surface Antigen, and Hepatitis C Antibody  
f. Female subjects of child -bearing potential, within 7 days  before the first dose of study medication.  If the urine test is 
positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, then a serum test is required. 
g. Echocardiogram or MUGA should be performed within 28 days  of registration and then at the end of every 4 cycles ( every 
12 weeks).   After 24 weeks on study, echocardiogram or MUGA may be spaced to every 18 weeks.  
h. Baseline assessments must be done within 28 days prior to the start of therapy.  Tumor assessments will  be performed every 
2 cycles (6 weeks  days 15 -21  for the first 24 weeks.  If at 24 weeks, a participant has SD or better by RECIST the 
frequency of assessments may be reduced to every 3 cycles (9 w eeks)  days 15 -21.  Effort should be made to use the same 
type of imaging to assess measurable lesions at baseline and in follow -up. 
i. During follow -up of patients who went off study for reasons other than PD , tumor assessments  should continue every 6 to 9 
weeks from the date of the last assessment until progressive disease is documented  
j. Baseline biopsy should be obtained within 7 days of initiating protocol therapy.  This biopsy is optional for participants in  
the dose -descalation cohort but mandatory in the dose expansion cohort.  See Section 9.1  for biopsy handling and processing 
instructions.  
k. Optional tumor biopsy after 6 weeks on treatment therapy (i.e. at cycle 3 day 1, or within 5 days prior ).   
l. Research blood collection for immune cells and cfDNA.  See S ection 9 for additional blood handl ing and processing 
instructions  
m. Research blood should only be collected on patients who come off treatment for progressive disease.  
n. Optional blood  collection for immune  cells/cfDNA  may be offered to patients who develop progressive disease during 
follow -up.   
o. All patients will also be asked to provide archival tumor tissue (either paraffin blocks or  15 unstained slides).  However, if 
archival tissue is not available or not evaluable, tha t will not be a basis to exclude the patient from any portion of the trial or 
the planned analysis  
p. Off-treatment  visit is to occur within 21 days of last dose .  End of treatment assessments do not have to be repeated if the 
same assessments were performed within 7 days prior to the visit (28 days for tumor assessments )).  If study treatment is 
discontinued for PD, then tumor assessments are not required for that study participant.  
q. Survival status should be collected annually , either by review of the medical  record or by phone call  (see Section 5.7). 
r. SAEs and ECIs need to be collected and reported up to 30 days post treatment to meet the DF/HCC reporting requirements 
and for  they need to be reported from the time consent is signed through 90 days follow ing cessation of treatment 
(120 days for pregnancy and lactations), or the initiation of new anti -cancer therapy, whichever is earlier.  
s. Cortisol may be drawn at any time of day, at baseline and on every Day 1.  
t. Baseline stool collection should be obtained within 28 days before starting protocol therapy. The C3D1 stool collection 
should be performed as close to C3D1 as possible, but may be collected up to 14 days prior. A sample will additionally be collected at the time of disease progression. An optional st ool sample may be collected at the time of grade ≥ 2 diarrhea 
after discussions with the PI. As these collections are for exploratory correlative purposes, failure to provide a sample at these timepoints will not constitute a protocol violation. See sectio n 9 and/or lab manual for stool collection and processing 
instructions.  
u. Each stool collection kit will contain a questionnaire for the patients to complete regarding the conditions surrounding thei r 
collection. These will be a part of the kit and are not to be administered in clinic. Failure to complete these questionnaires at  
the required or optional timepoints will not constitute a protocol violation.

MEASUREMENT OF EFFEC T 
 Although response is not the primary endpoint of this trial, participants with measurable disease will be assessed by standard criteria.  For the purposes of this study, participants should be re-evaluated every 6 weeks  for the first 24 weeks and then every 9 weeks  until progression. 
 11.1 
Antitumor Effect – Solid Tumors  
 For the purposes of this study, participants  should be re- evaluated for response every 6 weeks  for 
the first 24 weeks and then every 9 weeks until progression.  In addition to a baseline scan, confirmatory scans should also be obtained 9 weeks (+/- 7 days)  following initial documentation 
of objective response. In all participants, the date of progression will be documented as the first 

NCI Protocol #:  
DF/HCC Protocol #:  
Protocol Version Date: 4/18/2019  
 
65 date progression was observed. 
 Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the new international c riteria 
proposed by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) guideline (version 1.1) [Eur J Ca  45:228-247, 2009].  Changes in the largest diameter (unidimensional measurement) of 
the tumor lesions and the shortest diameter in the case of malignant lymph nodes are used in the 
RECIST criteria.  
    
11.1.1 Definitions  
 
Evaluable for Target Disease response.  Only those participants who have measurable 
disease present at baseline, have received at least one cycle of therapy, and have had their disease re -evaluated will be considered evaluable for target disease response.  These 
participants will have their response classified according to the definitions stated below.  
(Note:  Participants  who exhibit objective disease progression prior to the end of cycle 1 
will also be considered evaluable.) 
 
Evaluable Non- Target Disease Response.  Participants  who have lesions present at 
baseline that are evaluable but do not meet the definitions of measurable disease, have received at least one cycle of therapy, and have had their disease re- evaluated will be 
considered evaluable for non- target disease.  The response assessment is based on the 
presence, absence, or unequivocal progression of the lesions.  
 
11.1.2 Disease Parameters  
 
Measurable disease.  Measurable lesions are defined as those that can be accurately 
measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter  to be recorded) as ≥ 20 mm by  
chest x-ray or ≥10 mm with CT scan, MRI, or calipers by clinical exam .  All tumor 
measurements must be recorded in millimeters  (or decimal fractions of centimeters).  
 Note : Tumor lesions that are situated in a previously irradiated area might or might not be 
considered measurable.  
 
Malignant lymph nodes.  To be considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, a 
lymph node must be ≥ 15 mm in short axis when assessed by CT scan (CT scan slice 
thickness recommended to be no greater than 5 mm).  At baseline and in follow -up, only 
the short axis will be measured and followed. 
 
Non-measurable disease.  All other lesions (or sites of disease), including small lesions 
(longest diameter <10 mm or pathological lymph nodes with ≥10 to <15 mm short axis), are considered non -measurable disease.  Bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, 
pleural/pericardial effusions, lymphangitis cutis/pulmonitis, inflammatory breast disease, abdominal masses (not followed by CT or MRI), and cystic lesions are all considered  
NCI Protocol #:  
DF/HCC Protocol #:  
Protocol Version Date: 4/18/2019  
 
66 non-measurable.  
 
Note: Cystic lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple cysts should not be considered as malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non- measurable) 
since they are, by definition, simple cysts.  ‘Cystic lesions’ thou ght to represent cystic metastases can be considered as measurable 
lesions, if they meet the definition of measurability described above. However, if non-cystic lesions are present in the same participant, these are preferred for selection as target lesion s. 
 
Target lesions.   All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ and 5 
lesions in total, representative of all involved organs, should be identified as target lesions  and recorded and  measured at baseline.  Target lesions should be selected on the 
basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter), be representative of all involved organs, but in addition should be those that lend themselves to reproducible repeated measurements. It may be the case that, on occasion, the largest lesio n does not lend itself 
to reproducible measurement in which circumstance the next largest lesion which can be measured reproducibly should be selected. A sum of the diameters (longest for non-nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) for all target lesi ons will be calculated and reported 
as the baseline sum diameters. If lymph nodes are to be included in the sum, then only the short axis is added into the sum. The baseline sum diameters will be used as reference to further characterize any objective tumo r regression in the measurable dimension of the 
disease.  
 
Non-target lesions.  All othe r lesions (or sites of disease)  including any measurable 
lesions over and above the 5 target lesions should be identified as non- target lesions  and 
should also be recorded at baseline. Measurements of these lesions are not required, but the presence, absence, or in rare cases unequivocal progression of each should be noted throughout follow up.  
 
11.1.3 Metho ds for Evaluation of Disease 
 All measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation using a ruler, calipers , 
or a digital measurement tool.  All baseline evaluations should be performed as closely as possible to the beginning of treatment and never more than 4 weeks before the beginning of the treatment.  
 The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow- up. Imaging -based 
evaluation is preferred to evaluation by clinical examination unless the lesion(s) being 
followe d cannot be imaged but are assessable by clinical exam.  
 
Clinical lesions . Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are 
superficial ( e.g., skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes) and ≥10 mm in diame ter as 
assessed using calipers  (e.g., skin nodules).  In the case of skin lesions, documentation by 
NCI Protocol #:  
DF/HCC Protocol #:  
Protocol Version Date: 4/18/2019  
 
67 color photography, including a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion, is recommended.  
 
Chest x -ray.  Lesions on chest x- ray are acceptable as measurable lesions when they are 
clearly defined and surrounded by aerated lung; h owever, CT is preferable.  
 
Conventional CT and MRI. This guideline has defined measurability of lesions on CT 
scan based on the assumption that CT thickness is 5mm or less. If CT scans have slice thickness greater than 5 mm, the minimum size of a measurable lesion should be twice 
the slice thickness. MRI is also acceptable in certain situations ( e.g. for body scans).   
 Use of MRI remains a complex issue.  MRI has excellent contrast, spatial, and temporal resolution; however, there are many image acquisition variables involved in MRI, which greatly impact image quality, lesion conspicuity, and measurement.  Furthermore, the availability of MRI is variable globally.  As with CT, if an MRI is performed, the technical s pecifications of the scanning sequences used should be optimized for the 
evaluation of the type and site of disease.  Furthermore, as with CT, the modality used at follow-up should be the same as was used at baseline and the lesions should be measured/assessed on the same pulse sequence.  It is beyond the scope of the RECIST guidelines to prescribe specific MRI pulse sequence parameters for all scanners, body parts, and diseases.  Ideally, the same type of scanner should be used and the image acquisition protocol should be followed as closely as possible to prior scans.  Body scans should be performed with breath-hold scanning techniques, if possible.  
FDG -PET. While FDG -PET response assessments need additional study, it is sometimes 
reasonable to incorporate the use of FDG-PET scanning to complement CT scanning in assessment of progression (particularly possible 'new' disease).  New lesions on the basis of FDG -PET imaging can be identified according to the following algorithm:  
(a) Negative FDG -PET at baseli ne, with a positive FDG- PET at follow -up is a sign of 
PD based on a new lesion. (b)  No FDG- PET at baseline and a positive FDG -PET at follow -up:  If the positive 
FDG -PET at follow -up corresponds to a new site of disease confirmed by CT, this is 
PD.  If the  positive FDG- PET at follow -up is not confirmed as a new site of disease 
on CT, additional follow- up CT  scans are needed to determine if there is truly 
progression occurring at that site (if so, the date of PD will be the date of the initial abnormal FDG-PET scan).  If the positive FDG- PET at follow -up corresponds to a 
pre-existing site of disease on CT that is not progressing on the basis of the anatomic 
images, this is not PD.  
(c)  FDG -PET may be used to upgrade a response to a CR in a manner similar to a 
biopsy in cases where a residual radiographic abnormality is thought to represent fibrosis or scarring.  The use of FDG-PET in this circumstance should be prospectively described in the protocol and supported by disease- specific medical 
literature for th e indication.  However, it must be acknowledged that both approaches 
may lead to false positive CR due to limitations of FDG -PET and biopsy 
resolution/sensitivity.  
 
Note:  A ‘positive’ FDG -PET scan lesion means one which is FDG avid with an uptake 
NCI Protocol #:  
DF/HCC Protocol #:  
Protocol Version Date: 4/18/2019  
 
68 greater than twice that of the surrounding tissue on the attenuation corrected image. 
 
PET- CT. At present, the low dose or attenuation correction CT portion of a combined 
PET- CT is not always of optimal diagnostic CT quality for use with RECIST 
measurements.  However, if the site can document that the CT performed as part of a 
PET- CT is of identical diagnostic quality to a diagnostic CT (with IV and oral contrast), 
then the CT portion of the PET- CT can be used for RECIST measurements and can be 
used interchangeably  with conventional CT in accurately measuring cancer lesions over 
time.  Note, however, that the PET portion of the CT introduces additional data which may bias an investigator if it is not routinely or serially performed.   
MIBG (meta -iodobenzylguanidine) .The following is recommended, to assure high 
quality images are obtained.  
Patient preparation: Iodides, usually SSKI (saturated solution of potassium iodide), are administered to reduce thyroidal accumulation of free radioiodine, preferably beginning the day prior to injection and continuing for 3 additional days (4 days total).  For infants and children,  one drop t.i.d. is sufficient, for adolescents 2 drops 
t.i.d., and for adults 3 drops t.i.d. Participants  and/or parents are asked about exposure 
to potential interfering agents. If none is noted, an indwelling intravenous line i s 
established. The dose of MIBG is administered by slow intravenous injection over 90 seconds.  
Images from the head to the distal lower extremities should be obtained.  
I-123MIBG scintigraphy is performed to obtain both planar and tomographic images.  
Planar: Anterior and posterior views from the top of the head to the proximal lower 
extremities are obtained for 10 minutes at 24 hours and occasionally at 48 hours following injection of 10 mCi/1.7 square meters of body surface area (~150 μCi/kg, maximum 10 mCi). Anterior views of the distal lower extremities are adequate. A large field of view dual head gamma camera with low energy collimators is preferred.  
 SPECT: Most participants  receiving I -123 MIBG also undergo SPECT at 24 hours, 
using a single or multi -headed camera with a low energy collimator. The camera is 
rotated through 360 degrees, 120 projections at 25 seconds per stop. Data are reconstructed using filtered back projections with a Butterworth filter and a cut off frequency of 0.2- 0.5. SPECT/CT may be performed at institutions with this capacity.  
 
Ultrasound. Ultrasound is not useful in assessment of lesion size and should not be used 
as a method of measurement. Ultrasound examinations cannot be reproduced in their entirety for independent review at a later data and, because they are operator dependent, it cannot be guaranteed that the same technique and measurements will be taken from one assessment to the next. If new les ions are identified by ultrasound in the course of the 
NCI Protocol #:  
DF/HCC Protocol #:  
Protocol Version Date: 4/18/2019  
 
69 study, confirmation by CT or MRI is advised. If there is concern about radiation exposure 
from CT, MRI may be used instead of CT in selected instances.   
Endoscopy, Laparoscopy . The utilization of thes e techniques for objective tumor 
evaluation is not advised. However, such techniques may be useful to confirm complete 
pathological response when biopsies are obtained or to determine relapse in trials where 
recurrence following complete response (CR) or s urgical resection is an endpoint. 
 
Tumor markers . Tumor markers alone cann ot be used to assess response. If markers are 
initially above the upper normal limit, they must normalize for a participant to be considered in complete clinical response.  Specific guidelines for both CA -125 response 
(in recurrent ovarian cancer) and PSA response (in recurrent prostate cancer) have been published [ JNCI  96:487-488, 2004; J Clin Oncol  17, 3461-3467, 1999; J Clin Oncol  
26:1148-1159, 2008].  In addition, the Gynecologic Cancer Intergroup has developed CA-125 progression criteria which are to be integrated with objective tumor assessment 
for use in first -line trials in ovarian cancer [ JNCI  92:1534-1535, 2000]. 
 
Cytology, Histology . These techniques can be used to different iate between partial 
responses (PR) and complete responses (CR) in rare cases ( e.g., residual lesions in tumor 
types, such as germ cell tumors, where known residual benign tumors can remain). 
 The cytological confirmation of the neoplastic origin of any effusion that appears or worsens during treatment when the measurable tumor has met criteria for response or stable disease is mandatory to differentiate between response or stable disease (an effusion may be a side effect of the treatment) and progressive disease.  
 
11.1.4 Response Criteria  
 
 
11.1.4.1 Evaluation of Target Lesions  
 
Complete Response (CR) :  Disappearance of all target lesions.  Any pathological 
lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to <10 mm. 
 
Partial Response (PR) :  At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target 
lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.  
 
Progressive Disease (PD) :  At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of 
target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on s tudy (this includes the 
baseline sum if that is the smallest on study).  In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm.  (Note:  the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progressions). 
 
Stable Disease (SD) :  Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient 
increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on

70 study.  
 
11.1.4.2 Evaluation of Non- Target Lesions  
 
Complete Response (CR) :  Disappearance of all non -target lesions and normalization 
of tumor marker level.  All lymph nodes must be non- pathological in size (<10 mm 
short axis).  
 
Note:  If tumor markers are initially above the upper normal limit, they must normalize for a patient to be  considered in complete clinical response. 
 
Non-CR/Non -PD:  Persistence of one or more non-target lesion(s) and/or 
maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits.  
 
Progressive Disease (PD) :  Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or 
unequivocal progression of existing non- target lesions.  Unequivocal progression 
should not normally trump target lesion status.  It must be representative of overall disease status change, not a single lesion increase.     
 Although a clear progression of “non-target” lesions only is exceptional, the opinion 
of the treating physician should prevail in such circumstances, and the progression 
status should be confirmed at a later time by the review panel (or Principal Investigator). 
 11.1.4.3 
Evaluation of New Lesion s 
 The finding of a new lesion should be unequivocal (i.e. not due to difference in scanning technique, imaging modality, or findings thought to represent something other than tumor (for example, some ‘new’ bone lesions may be simply healing or flare of pre-existing lesions). However, a lesion identified on a follow-up scan in an anatomical location that was not scanned at baseline is considered new and will indicate PD. If a new lesion is equivocal (because of small size etc.), follow -up 
evaluation will clarify if it truly represents new disease and if PD is confirmed, progression should be declared using the date of the initial scan on which the lesion was discovered.  
 
11.1.4.4 
Evaluation of Best Overall Response  
 The best overall response is the best response reco rded from the start of the treatment 
until disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started).  The patient's best response assignment will depend on the achievement of both measurement and confirmation criteria.

11.1.5 Duration of Response  
 
Duration of overall response:  The duration of overall response is measured from the time 
measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started , or 
death due to any cause. Participants without events reported are censored at the last 
disease evaluation ).

Duration of overall complete response: The duration of overall CR is measured from the 
time measurement criteria are first met for CR until the first da te that progressive disease 
is objectively documented, or death due to any cause. Participants without events 
reported are censored at the last disease evaluation .  
 
Duration of stable disease :  Stable disease is measured from the start of the treatment 
until the criteria for progression are met, taking as reference the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started, including the baseline measurements.  
 
11.1.6 Progression -Free Survival  
 
Overall Survival : Overall Survival (OS) is defined as the time from randomization (or 
registration) to death due to any cause, or censored at date last known alive. 
 
Progression-Free Survival : Progression -Free Survival (PFS) is defined as the time from 
randomization (or registration) to the earlier of progression or death due to any cause. Participants alive without disease progression are censored at date of last disease evaluation. 
 
Time to Progression: Time to Progression (TTP) is defined as the time from 
randomization (or registration) to progression, or censored a t date of last disease 
evaluation for those without progression reported.

11.3.1 Definition of Tumor Response Using Immune -Related Response Criteria (irRECIST)  
 irRECIST is RECIST 1.1 adapted as described below to account for the unique tumor response seen with immuno -therapeutics.  
 irRECIST will be used by site investigators and local radiology review to assess tumor  response 
and progression, and may be used to make treatment decisions.  This data will be collected in the clinical database.  
 irRECIST will be used by the central imaging vendor, however, this evaluation will be done retrospectively.  
NCI Protocol #:  
DF/HCC Protocol #:  
Protocol Version Date: 4/18/2019  
 
73  
irRECIST takes in to account the clinical condition/stability of subjects, as described in the table 
below, in addition to response or progression via tumor imaging.  Clinically stable is defined by the following criteria: 
• Absence of symptoms and signs indicating clinically  significant progression of disease, 
including worsening of laboratory values. 
• No decline in ECOG performance status 
• Absence of rapid progression of disease 
• Absence of progressive tumor at critical anatomical sites (e.g., cord compression)  
requiring urgent alternative medical intervention.

Protocol Version Date: 4/18/2019  
 
74 Table: irRECIST: Tumor Imaging and Treatment after 1st Radiologic Evidence of PD or  SD, 
CR, or PR 
 
 
In determining whether or not the tumor burden has increased, decreased or stayed stable, site investigators should consider all target lesions a well as non -target lesions.  
 Any subject deemed clinically unstable should be discontinued from trial treatment at first 
evidence of progressive disease by tumor imaging and is not required to have repeat tumor imaging for confirmation.  
 For a clinically stable subject with first radiologic evidence of progressive disease (i.e.  
unconfirmed progression of disease), it is at the discretion of the site investigator to continue treating the subject with the assigned treatment per protocol until progression of disease is confirmed at least 28 days from the date of the tumor imaging first suggestiong PD.  If 
progression is not confirmed on the subsequent tumor imaging, the subject should continue to receive study therapy and have tumor imaging preformed per protocol, or sooner if clincially

75 indicated, to monitor disease status. If radiologic progression is confirmed by subsequent tumor 
imaging, then the subject will be discontinued from trial treatment.  
 NOTE : If a subject with confirmed progression by tumor imaging (i.e. 2 scans at least 28 days 
apart demonstrating progressive disease) is clinically stable or clinically improved, and there is no further increase in the tumor burden at the confirmatory scan, an exception may be considered to continue treatment upon consultation with the principal investigator.  
 The same imaging modality (i.e., CT or MRI), acquisition and technical parameters should be used throughout the study for a given subject.  11.3.1.1 
Immune -Related Best Overall Response Using irRECIST (irBOR)  
 
irBOR is the best confirmed overall response over the study as a whole, recorded between the date of first dose until the last tumor assessment before subsequent therapy (except for local palliative radiotherapy for painful bone lesions) for the individual subject in the study.  For the as sessment of irBOR, all available assessments per subject 
are considered.  
 irCR or irPR determinations included in the irBOR assessment must be confirmed by a 
second (confirmatory) evaluation meeting the criteria for response and performed no less 
than 4 we eks after the criteria for response are first met.

Collaborative Research Future Use of Data and Biospecimens  
 Tissue, blood, stool, bodily fluids, and other materials derived from these will be collected in this study to analyze genes, DNA, RNA, proteins and cells for the study’s correlative endpoints and potential future research, utilizing new types of biomarker testing as it becomes available.  
 These samples and any data generated as a part of these clinical trials may be used for future research studies and may be provided to collaborating investigators both within and outside of the DF/HCC for either correlat ive endpoints or secondary use. Samples and data may be shared with 
outside non- profit academic investigators, as well as with for -profit pharmaceutical investigators 
or commercial entitites, with whom we collaborate. When samples or data are sent to collaborators and when any research is performed on them, all information will be identified with a code, and will not contain any PHI, such as name, birthday, or MRNs.   In order to allow the greatest amount of research to be performed on the specimens and information generated as a part of this trial, researchers in this study may share results of genetic 
sequencing with other scientists. De- identified specimen or genetic data may be placed into one 
of more publicly- accessible scientific databases, such as the National Institutes of Health’s 
Database for Genotypes and Phenotypes (dbGaP). The results from the correlative research on this study will be shared with these public databases. Through such databases, researchers from around the world will have access to de- identified samples or data for future research. More 
detailed information, beyond the public database, may only be accessed by scientists at other research centers who have received special permission to review de- identified data.

STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 All statistics for both primary and secondary endpoints will be descriptive in nature.  13.1 
Study Design/Endpoints  
  This is a phase Ib dose de-escalation study with a primary objective of evaluating the safety and 
NCI Protocol #:  
DF/HCC Protocol #:  
Protocol Version Date: 4/18/2019  
 
77 tolerability of pembrolizumab in combination with T- DM1 in patients with metastatic HER2+ 
breast cancer.  A cohort of 6 patients will initially be enrolled at dose level 1.  If 2 or more 
patients experience a DLT, 6 additional patients will be treated at dose level -1.  If 2 or more 
patients experience a DLT at dose level -1, the study will be terminated.  If 0 or 1 of 6 patients 
experience a DLT at dose level 1 or dose level -1, that dose level will be considered as RP2D.  
Once the RP2D is determined, 15 additional patients will be enrolled in an expansion cohort. 
 
Primary Endpoint 
• Safety and tolerability profile.  
o Assessment of DLTs during the first 21 days of treatment, as defined in Section 5.4 
o Determination of the RP2D 
o Maximum grade of all treatment- related adverse events using CTCAE v4.0 
 
Secondary Endpoints include: 
• Objective response rate (ORR)  using RECIST 1.1 and irRECIST 
• Progression- free survival (PFS)  using RECIST 1.1 and irRECIST 
• Duration of response, in patients who achieve an objective response 
• Disease control rate (CR+PR+SD) at 18 weeks using RECIST 1.1 and irRECIST 
• Overall survival 
 
Blood and tissue c orrelative science objectives include:  
• To characterize a broad array of immune markers in metastatic HER2 -positive breast 
tumors (characterization will be  based on histology, protein expression, mRNA 
expression , and genomic analysis) 
• To explore how different immunosuppressive and/or immune- stimulating  immune 
marker profile s at baseline correlate with disease response to therapy (response assessed 
by RECIST 1.1 and irRECIST ) 
• To characterize changes in immune marker profile in peripheral blood mononuclear cells 
(PBMCs) from baseline (pre -trial therapy) to on-treatment assessments  
• To explore whether induction of changes in the immunosuppressive and/or immune-
stimulating immune marker profile in PBMCs between baseline and on-treatment 
assessments correlates with disease response to therapy (response assessed by RECIST 1.1 and irRECIST ) 
o In terms of response as assessed on serial scans  
o In terms of best response achieved at any time on trial 
• To investigate whether there is an immune marker in circulating PBMCs that corresponds 
to tumor infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) percentage in baseline tumor 
• In the cohort of patients who have re-biopsy at week 6 of treatment:  To characterize 
changes in a broad array of immune markers from baseline (as characterized above ) to 6 
weeks  on trial therapy , and explore changes in the tumor microenvironment that correlate 
with disease response to therapy

78 13.2 Sample Size, Accrual Rate and Study Duration  
 
Sample size for this trial will depend on the outcome of the dose de-escalation phase. Six to 12 patients will be enrolled in the dose de-escalation phase, and once RP2D is determined, 15 more patients will be  enrolled in an expansion cohort. The operating characteristics of the dose de-
escalation portion of this study are shown below, which provides the probability of declaring the RP2D for a range of underlying true DLT rates. For example, for a toxicity that  occurs in 60% of 
patients, there is less than 5% probability (0.04) of declaring the RP2D.    
True underlying DLT rate  10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% 
Probability of declaring RP2D  89% 66% 42% 23% 11% 4% 1% 0.2%  <0.01%  
 With 6 patients treated at the RP2D during dose de-escalation, and 15 patients in the dose expansion cohort (n = 21), the probability of observing at least one serious toxicity event is 89% if the true toxicity rate is 10%, and 66% if the true toxicity rate is 5%.  
 Objective response rate will be estimated among 15 patients in the expansion cohort and patients with measurable disease at screening who were treated at RP2D in the dose de- escalation phase.  
A total of 15 to 21 patients will be evaluable for ORR.  The table below gives the 95% CI (calculated using the exact binomial method) for the ORR estimate in a cohort size of 15 patients, given various true underlying ORR.  For example, if the true underlying response rate is 40% among 15 patients, the 95% CI would be 19-64%.   
True underlying ORR  20% 27% 33% 40% 47% 53% 
95% CI (n=15)  4-48% 8-55% 12-62% 16-68% 21-73% 27-79% 
 We estimate accrual to be 2 per month, and estimate accrual will take 12 -18 months to complete.

Analysis of Primary Endpoints  
 The determination of the RP2D under the dose de- escalation scheme is defined in Section 13.1.  
Treatment -related toxicities will be summarized by maximum grade and by term using CTCAE 
v4.0 and reported with 90% binomial exact confidence intervals.   13.6

Protocol Version Date: 4/18/2019  
 
79 Best overall response will be assessed among patients who received at least one dose of both 
study drugs at the RP2D and have measurable disease at screening. Radiographic response will be assessed using RECIST 1.1 criteria as defined in section 11.1.4, and irRECIST will be 
assessed as defined in section 11.3.  The objective response rate by RECIST 1.1  (CR + PR) and 
immune -related response (irCR + irPR) will be reported with 95% exact confidence intervals.   
 PFS will be describ ed using the method of Kaplan-Meier, and it will be presented with a 95% 
confidence interval. PFS is defined as the time from study registration to radiographic evidence of disease progression (as defined in Section 5.6) or death due to any cause, whicheve r occurred 
first. Patients alive without disease progression are censored at the date of last disease evaluation.  
 Correlative objectives will be descriptive -only, using summary statistics (such as mean, sd, 
median, IQR and range) to give the empirical dis tribution of immune markers detected in the 
study population. With 15 patients evaluable for immune markers and under a Gaussian assumption to a continuous measure, a 95% confidence interval around a mean will have a width of approximately one standardized unit.   Correlation to responses will be reported as odds- ratios 
with 95% confidence intervals.  Specifically, as an example, we plan to measure PD -L1 
expression by immunohistochemistry in baseline biopsies as a continuous variable, and correlate baseline PD -L1 expression and change in PD-L1 expression with response (by RECIST and 
irRECIST) as an exploratory analysis.  All analysis of Oncopanel in correlation with patient 
outcomes are exploratory and hypothesis- generating. Any promising findings will be exp lored in 
future studies.     13.7 
Reporting and Exclusions  
 
13.7.1 Evaluation of T oxicity  
 
All patients who receive any amount of either study drug will be evaluable for safety and 
tolerability, even if there are major protocol treatment deviations or if they are later found 
to be ineligible . 
 
13.7.2 Evaluation of the Primary Efficacy Endpoint  
 
All participants who have received at least one dose of study medication  at the RP2D will 
be assessed for PFS, and the subset of patients with measurable disease will be assessed for objective response.

90 APPENDIX D  GUIDELINES FOR LIVER BIOPSY  
 
As nodular regenerative hyperplasia (NRH) can be a very subtle diagnosis to make on liver biopsy, every attempt should be made to maximize the amount of tissue obtained. A minimum size of  an 
18 gauge needle and percutaneous biopsies of at least 1.5 cm in length are recommended, if clinically appropriate. In order to diagnose NRH, reticulin and trichrome stains are necessary. Smaller biopsies obtained via a transjugular approach, as well as  smaller biopsy gun needle 
biopsies, are discouraged. Small wedge biopsies are also  discouraged. 
NCI Protocol #:  
DF/HCC Protocol #:  
Protocol Version Date: 4/18/2019  
 
91  APPENDIX E GUIDELINES FOR COLL ECTING RESEARCH BIOP SY TISSUE  
 
Tissue specimens will be collected from metastatic lesions using standard institutional procedures. The amount of tissue collected may follow the guidelines listed below.  Skin/chest wall: A goal of 2 5-mm punch biopsies will be obtained.  Lymph node: A goal of 5-7 core biopsy specimens will be obtained using an 18- gauge needle.  
 Liver: A goal of 5-7 core biopsy specimens will be obtained using an 18-gauge needle.  Lung: Because of the risk of pneumothorax associated with core needle biopsies of lung nodules, no core biopsies of lung nodules are mandated on this protocol, unless they are clinically indicated.  
Bone: Because the yield of malignant tissue from bone biopsies tends to be relatively low, if a patient has another accessible site of disease (i.e. skin, lymph node, liver), that site should be biopsied preferentially. If bone is the only biopsy- accessible site, then a goal of 3 -6 core biopsy 
specimens will be obtained using an 11- 13 gauge needle.  
 Please note that the above are guidelines for the amount of tissue to be obtained, and are not meant to replace clinical judgment at the time the procedure is performed.  Less than 
the goal quantity of tissue is accepted for each type of biopsy, and will be left to the clinical judgment of the physician performing the procedure.  Alternative amounts of tissue collected, based on best judgment of the physician performing the procedure, are allowed per protocol.  If a patient is undergoing resection of a lesion for clinical reasons (i.e. wedge resection of a new lung lesion for confirmation of diagnosis or re-testing of hormone receptor or HER2 status; or, a resection of a chest wall lesion; or, resection of  a lymph node), then the patient may opt to have a portion of that tissue (roughly equivalent to the goal amount of tissue listed in the guidelines above, i.e. the equivalent of two 5-mm punch biopsies of the skin, or 4-6 18- gauge 
core biopsies) stored for research at the time of the procedure (provided that the tissue is processed as specified), in which case, the patient would not be required to undergo a separate research biopsy at baseline on this protocol.

• T- DM1 will be administered on day 1 (+/- 3 days) of each cycle.  The first infusion of T -DM1 will be 
administered over 90 minutes (+/ - 10 minutes) with a 60 minute observation period.  If well tolerated, 
subsequent doses of T -DM1 may be administered over 30 minutes (+/ - 10 minutes), with a minimum 30- minute 
observation period after infusion.  (Section 5.3.2)  
• Pembrolizumab should be administered prior to T -DM1 administration.  There should be no overlap in timing of 
the two administrations.  (Section 5.3.1)  
• Premedication for nausea and infusion reactions are not commonly required but may be given at the 
investigator’s discretion.  (Section 5.3.2)  
• Pre-treatment Criteria is found in section 5.2.

3.1 DRUG PRODUCT 
3.2 STABILITY AND HANDLING OF DRUG PRODUCT  
•Pembrolizumab  (MK-3475 ) Powder for Solution for Infusion vials should be sto red at
refrigerated conditions 2 – 8 °C (36 - 46 ºF ).  Prior to reconstitution, the vial of
lyophilized powder can be out of refrigeration (temperatures at or below 25°C (77°F))
for up to 24 hours.
•To determine whether to report a temperature excursion, the temperature values should
be rounded to whole numbe rs.
•Rounding:
1.Decimal values from 0.1 to 0.4 round down to the nearest whole number (e.g., 8.3
= 8)
2.Decimal values from 0.5 to 0.9 round up to the nearest whole number (e.g., 8.7 = 9)
• Then compare the rounded values to the required temperature range to determine if
there's an excursion.• Pembrolizumab  (MK- 3475)  Powder for Solution for Infusion, 50 mg/vial
•Pembrolizumab ( MK-3475) Powder for Solution for Infusion is a sterile, non-pyrogenic
lyophilized powder for intravenous infusion supplied in single-use Type I glass vial

3.3 DOSE CALCULATION 
Follow directions applicable to the dose level (mg/kg) of the study 
2 mg/kg Dose 
• The preparation  of infusion solutions should be based on the  dose level and the
subject’s actual body weight in kilograms (kg)  on the day of dosing . However if
preparation of the infusion is required to be completed prior to the subject’s visit• Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and
discoloration prior to administration. Discard the drug product vial if visible particles
are observed.
•Sites should follow their SOPs for drug transport and delivery, with all possible effort to
minimize agitation of the reconstituted and diluted drug product between the pharmacy
and the clinic
•DO NOT USE PEMBROLIZUMAB ( MK-3475) IF DISCOLORATION IS
OB
SERVED.
•DO NOT SHAKE OR FREEZE THE VIAL(S).
•DO 
NOT ADMINISTER THE PRODUCT AS AN INTRAVENOUS (IV) PUSH
OR BOLUS.
•DO NOT COMBINE, DILUTE OR ADMINISTER IT AS AN INFUSION WITH
OTHER MEDICINAL PRODUCTS .
•DO NOT CO-ADMINISTER OTHER DRUGS THROUGH THE SAME
INFUSION LINE.
•Any departure  from the guidance listed in this manual, must be discussed with
sponsor

(e.g., per local SOP, logi stical issues, etc.), then the solution may be prepared in 
advance in accordance with the instructions in this manual.  
•If infusion solution is prepared in advance, weight from the most recent scheduled or
unscheduled visit should be used.
•If the weight f rom the most recent scheduled or unscheduled visit is used, the dose
amount should be recalculated and a new preparation of the infusion solution created
if the subject 's weight on the day of dosing changes  by more than 10% from the last
weight measurement .
oEx:  100 kg. at previous visit but current visit is less than 90 kg. or greater
than 110 kg . then recalculation of the dose and a new preparation of
infusion  solution  is  required
10 mg/kg Dose  
• The preparation of infusion solutions should be based on  the dose level and  the
subject’s actual body weigh t in kilograms (kg)  on the day of dosing . However if
preparation of the infusion is required to be completed prior to the subject’s visit
(e.g., per local SOP, logistical issues, etc.), then the solution may be prepared in
advance in accordance with the in structions in this manual.
•If infusion solution is prepared in advance, weight from the most recent scheduled or
unscheduled visit should be used.
•If the weight from the most recent scheduled or unscheduled visit is used, the dose
amount should be recalc ulated and a new preparation of the infusion solution created if• Required dose amount (mg) = dose level (mg/kg) * subject weight (kg)
•C
alculate the required number of pembrolizumab ( MK-3475) vials by dividing the
required dose amount (mg) by 50 (mg) and rounding to the next whole number.
Example 1 (2 mg/kg dose)
Dose level = 2 mg/kg, subject weight = 69 kg
Required dose amount (mg) = 2 mg/kg * 69 kg = 138 mg
R
equired number of pembrolizumab ( MK-3475) vials = 138/50 = 2.76
R
ounded to next whole number = 3 vials

the subject's weight on the day of dosing changes by more than 10% from the last 
weight measurement.  
oEx:  100 kg. at previous visit but current visit is les s 90 kg. or greater
110 kg. then recalculation of the dose and a new preparation of
infusion  solution  is  required
200 mg Fixed Dose  
•Required Number of vials = 4 vials (50 mg/ vial)
•8 mLs Total•Required dose amount (mg) = dose level (mg/kg) * subject weight (kg)
•Calculate the required number of pembrolizumab ( MK-3475) vials by dividing the
required dose amount (mg) by 50 (mg) and rounding to the next whole number.
E
xample 2 (10 mg/kg dose)
Dose level = 10 mg/kg, subject weight = 69 kg
Required dose amount (mg) = 10 mg/kg * 69 kg = 690 mg
R
equired number of pembrolizumab ( MK-3475) vials = 690/50 = 13.8
R
ounded to next whole number = 14 vials
• Preference is for sites to prepare study medication on day of infusion. For sites that
must prepare dose in advance, weight from most recent scheduled or unscheduled
visit can be used for advanced preparation. Then on day of dosing, reweigh subject
for actual weight.
▪If the weight on day of dosing is within 10% of weight used for
advanced dose calculation, you can  proceed with dosing what was
prepared during advanced preparations
▪If a patient’s weight on day of dosing has fluctuated by more than 10%
compared to weight used for advanced study prep, then the dose should
be recalculated using the new weight measurement.

3.4 RECONSTITUTION OF DRUG PRODUCT (POWDER FOR SOLUTION FOR 
INFUSION, 50 MG/VIAL)  
• Aseptic technique must be strictly observed throughout the preparation procedure.
•Use of a biosafety cabinet is preferred since no anti-microbial preservative is present in
the product; however, it is not mandatory unless specified by site standard operating
procedure.
•Equilibrate required number of pembrolizumab ( MK- 3475) vials to room temperature.
•The
 preferred method of dose preparation is the volumetric method.
• S
ponsor recommends reconstitution and administration of pembrolizumab (MK-3475)
that follows the parameters in this manual, however if use of gravimetric preparation is
mandatory due to local site procedures, the following requirements must be satisfied and
documented:
• Dr
aw the required volume up to 2.0 mL (50 mg) of pembrolizumab from each
vial
• Limit the number of punctures of each vial to two (one for reconstitution, one
for withdrawal)
• For gravimetric preparation method using density of reconstituted pembrolizumab
solution, a value of 1.03 g/mL should be used
• For gravimetric preparation method using the total solid content information, the
following information on the total solid and active contents per vial of pembrolizumab
lyophilized product should be used:
•Total calculated weight of pembrolizumab per vial = 60.0 mg
•Total calculated weight of solids per vial (including pembrolizumab) = 232.2
mg
• does not support methods of preparation of  agents beyond what is
stated in the product literature. Sites should reference the SmPCs or packaging inserts
for preparation instructions.

Caution: To avoid foaming, ensure that water is delivered along the walls 
of the vial and not directly squirted on the lyophilized powder.  
•Remove the needle(s) from the sto pper of pembrolizumab ( MK-3475 ) vial.
•Slowly swirl the vial to allow reconstitution of the lyophilized powder. Allow up   to 5
minutes for the bubbles to clear.•Remove the cap from the seal. Do not decrimp the vial .
•Insert a needle through the stopper of the pembrolizumab ( MK-3475) Powder for
Solution for Infusion vial(s) to release vacuum (if any). Leave the needle inserted in the
stopper. If local standard operating procedures (SOPs) prohibit leaving a needle
inserted in the stopper, this step can be skipped.
•If the site procedures require use of spikes or other closed system transfer device s
(CSTDs), please contact sponsor for approval.
•If one WFI bottle is used to reconstitute one pembrolizumab (MK-3475) vial: Attach a
3 mL syringe to a needle. Insert the needle through the stopper of the sterile water for
injection (WFI) bottle. Draw excess of 2.3 mL of WFI in the syringe and remove the
syringe-needle assembly from the vial.
•If one WFI bottle is used to reconstitute more than one pembrolizumab (MK-3475)
vials: Insert a needle through the stopper of the sterile WFI bottle. Attach a 3 mL
syringe to the needle inserted in the sterile WFI bottle and draw excess of 2.3 mL of
WFI in the syringe. Carefully detach the syringe without removing the needle from the
WFI bottle. Repeat the process to fill additional syringes while keeping the needle
inserted in sterile WFI bottle to minimize particle shedding from stopper. Use a new
sterile WFI bottle after filling approximately 10 syringes.
•Attac
h a new needle to the filled syringe (if applicable). Remove excess air and WFI
from the syringe-needle assembly while ensuring that there is 2.3 mL WFI still
remaining in it.
•Ase
ptically add 2.3 mL of sterile water for injection to yield a 25 mg/mL (pH 5.2-5.8)
solut
ion of pembrolizumab ( MK- 3475).

Caution: Do not shake the vials  otherwise this may result in formation of foam. If 
foam is noticed in either vial or bag, the drug product will need to be discarded . A new 
preparation should be made, taking care not to shake or agitate  the product.  
3.5 PREPARATION OF INFUSION SOLUTI ON 
•Calculate the volume of pembrolizumb ( MK-3475 ) and normal saline required to
prepare the infusion (admixture) bag
Volume of reconstituted pembrolizumab  (MK-3475 ) (mL) = required dose amount (mg)
/ 25 (mg/mL)
Volume of normal saline = total infusion volume – volume of pembrolizumab  (MK-
3475 ) from above
•If a bag pre -filled with normal saline is being used, remove the excess volume of normal
saline using a sterile syringe (Polypropylene, latex -free) att ached to a suitable needle.
Keep in consideration the excess bag fill volume as well as the volume of reconstituted•Aseptic technique must be strictly observed throughout the preparation procedure.
•Reconstitute the required number of vials to prepare the infusion solution.
•C
hoose a suitable infusion bag size so that the following conditions are met:
•C
oncentration of pembrolizumab ( MK-3475) is between 1 mg/mL and 10
mg/mL
•The infusion volume to bag capacity ratio should not be less than 0.3.  In
other words, the bag must be filled to at least 30% of its capacity.
•C
hoose a suitable infusion bag materia l. The bag may be empty or it may contain
normal saline.  The following infusion bag materials are compatible with
pembrolizumab ( MK- 3475):
•PVC plasticized with DEHP
•Non-PVC (polyolefin)
•EVA
•PE lined polyolefin

pembrolizumab  (MK-3475 ) to be added to the bag to prepare the infusion solution.  This 
helps ensure that the concentration in the bag can be accurately calculated and falls 
within the acceptable range of 1 mg/mL to 10 mg/mL. If the site would like to proceed 
without removing excess saline they must ensure that the concentration of MK -3475

Dear Research Participant:  
 
You are receiving this letter because you participated in the research study called, “A phase I cancer  
Study of Pembrolizumab in Combination with Trastuzumab -DM1 in Metastatic HER2 -Positive Breast 
Cancer,” and we would like to share some recent changes with you.   
  WHAT HAS HAPPENED?  
 The overall study plan has not changed , however the consent form  for th is study  has recen tly been 
updated to reflect  changes in the regulations regarding the way that  biological specimens  (blood, tissue, 
and stool  (which were  collected for research purposes) ) and data may be  handled. These changes are as 
follows:     
1. Biobanking —biological specimens previously collected from you may be shared with an 
outside lab or collaborator  and will be banked for future research.  
 Biological specimens (such as blood, tissue, bodily fluids, other specimens collected as a part of the study, and any materials that may be derived from these) will be collected and shared with an outside lab or collaborator for analysis. The specimens will not be identifiable. The specimens will be banked for future use.  
 As a part of this study, you previously a greed to provide researchers with a sample of your 
tumor tissue from a prior biopsy, surgery, or procedure. There is a risk associated with submitting this type of tissue for research studies and biobanking. Generally, hospitals will keep some of your tiss ue from a prior biopsy, surgery, or procedure. This tissue may be used to help 
treat your cancer in the future. There is a small risk that when the tissue sample is submitted to the study or the biobank that your tissue could be used up.    
2. Data Collection —Your data may be shared with an outside collaborator or stored for future 
use.  
 Data will be collected and shared with an outside collaborator for analysis. The data will not be identifiable. The data will be banked for future use.  
  
3. Future use of data and specimens —Your de -identifiable data and/or biospecimens which 
were previously collected during this study may be stored and used for future research.    
2 
  
Your personal information and/or biospecimens collected during this study may be stored and used f or future research.  If so, any personal identifiers will be removed so that the information 
or samples cannot be linked back to you. As a result, we will no longer be able to identify and 
destroy them.  
 
Investigators, including investigators from collaborating institutions, can request this data and samples for new research.  Samples and data may also be shared with outside non -profit 
academic investigators as well as with for- profit pharmaceutical investigators or commercial 
entities, with whom we collabo rate.  
 You will not be asked to provide additional informed consent for the use of your de -identified 
information or samples in future research.  
 
Future research studies may include genetic research.  Your genes are unique to you.  At this 
time, you canno t be identified through this research.  There is a risk that you might be 
reidentified in the future as genetic research progresses.

Study Desi gn:  Retrospective , multicenter  clinical evaluation of patients' outcome 
initially enrolled (n= 414+165=579 ) into the Exalenz pivotal studies 
(protocol s  HIS-EX-408 and/or PLT -BID-1108 respectively ). The 
information collected in this study will be anonymous.  
   
Study Population:  A maximum of  579 adult male or female  patients  enrolled in to the 
Exalenz studies (protocols HIS -EX-408 and/or PLT -BID-1108 ) 
who performed a 13C-Methacetin Breath  Test.  
 
Main Inclusion Criteria :  Patient has been tested with the MBT in the past Exalenz pivotal 
studies protocols HIS -EX-408 and/or PLT -BID-1108 (from August 
2008  to September 2012 ).  
 
Main Exclusion Criteria:  Patient had been enrolled into the pivotal study but not included in 
the final analysis due to conditions / factors interfering with the 
MBT (i.e. exclusion criteria within the HIS -EX-408 and/or PLT-
BID-1108 study).  
 
 
Statistical  Analysis:  
Introduction:  
It is anticipated that 3 -5% of patients with stable cirrhosis will develop 
hepatic decompensation and achieve an end -point within a  year.  An 
additional 1 -2% would be expected to die from these complications per year. 
This study is conducted 6 years post i nitial enrollment, accordingly the 
expected amount of complications are expected to be 6 times higher.  
Furthermore some of the patients that were not considered as cirrhotic at the 
time of enrollment may progress to cirrhosis and deteriorate.

 CONFIDENTIAL  1. BACKGROUND INFORMATI ON 
1.1. Clinical outcome in patients with chronic liver disease  
Chronic liver disease is the 9th most common cause of death in the United States.  
Unfortunately, mortality secondary to chronic liver disease, cirrhosis and its complications 
is expected to increase in the future. This is primarily due to the maturation of the Hepatitis 
C Virus (HCV) ep idemic, a rising rate of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and an increasing 
prevalence of non -alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).  
Mortality in patients with chronic liver disease is typically confined to patients with 
cirrhosis; and the mortality risk in these  patients has long been assessed by the Child -Pugh -
Turcotte (CTP) score . More recently, the Model of End -Stage Liver Disease (MELD) has 
been shown to more accurately predict 30 day survival in patients with cirrhosis. The 
MELD score is now utilized by the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) to prioritize 
patients awaiting liver transplantation. Those factors which contribute to the CTP scoring 
systems are : Bilirubin, INR, albumin, ascites, encephalopathy and creatinine . The MELD 
score uses only blood tests and is thus less prone to subjective assessments such as ascites or 
encephalopathy.  
In general, declining liver function and an increase in the CTP and/or MELD scores appear  
prior to  complications of cirrhosis; gastroi ntestinal bleeding from portal hypertens ion 
(varceal and non -variceal), ascites, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), hepatic 
encephalopathy ( HE), hepato -renal syndrome (types 1 and 2) and HCC. Patients are 
considered to have stable cirrhosis when they  have normal or near -normal  hepatic function 
and no prior complications of cirrhosis. Such patients have a CTP score of less than 7; 
reflective of Childs class A cirrhosis. Approximately 3 -5% of patients with stable Child 
class A cirrhosis will develop wor sening in hepatic function and/or complications of 
cirrhosis and decompensate on a yearly basis. In many patients the development of these 
complications, the deterioration in global liver function and the rise in MELD is a slow 
gradual process which allows  sufficient time for successful transplantation. In contrast, 
approximately one -third of patients with cirrhosis develop rapid hepatic decompensation a 
precipitous rise in MELD and die from complications of cirrhosis before they can either be 
considered fo r or receive a liver transplant.  This observation explains why pre -transplant 
mortality for patients on the UNOS waiting list is actually greatest in patients with low 
MELD, not high MELD scores. It is currently believed that such patients have marginal 
hepatic metabolic capacity or hepatic reserve which both places them at risk for developing 
complications of cirrhosis and for rapid deterioration when complications occur.  
 
1.2. Identifying patients with marginal hepatic reserve at risk for complications and 
decompensation:  
  Tests to assess hepatic metabolic function are conducted by administering either 
intravenously or orally a compound with high hepatic extraction ratio and/or rapid hepatic 
metabolism.  The rate at which the parent compound is removed from  the serum or a 
metabolic product of the parent compound appears in either the blood, urine, breath or saliva 
reflects hepatic metabolic function.  Some of the compounds which have been successfully

 CONFIDENTIAL  utilized for this purpose include choline, caffeine, gala ctose, aminopyrine, erythromycin, 
lidocaine and methionine and Methacetin [N -(4-Methoxy -phenyl) acetamide]. Previous 
studies utilizing a battery of liver function tests have demonstrated that these tests correlate 
with worsening fibrosis and cirrhosis. The  hepatic metabolism of lidocaine to 
monoethylglycinexylodide (MEGX) has been shown to decline with increasing liver fibrosis 
and with worsening stages of cirrhosis, improve with successful treatment of the underlying 
liver disease, and to accurately predic t which patients with stable cirrhosis awaiting liver 
transplantation were at risk to develop future hepatic decompensation. Unfortunately, 
administering lidocaine to perform this test is associated with parasthesias and could 
precipitate cardiac arrythmia s. Thus, while promising as a potential liver function test the 
use of lidocaine for this purpose has been largely abandoned.  
  
1.3. Identifying patients with progression of liver disease and fibrosis at earlier stages (pre -
cirrhosis) of liver disease:  
 Chronic  liver patients that have varied levels of fibrosis based on biopsy need to be 
monitored for progression of disease as well. A significant percentage of these patients in 
earlier stages of liver disease have recurrent normal blood tests in the standard liv er panel 
blood tests. Additionally, even patients where the blood tests do show irregular values, the 
values do not always correlate with disease progression and a non -invasive test that is both 
safe and accurate would be very beneficial to monitor their l iver health. This is especially 
important in decision making regarding the decision to begin treatment when signs of 
disease progression are apparent to prevent deterioration to cirrhosis. Furthermore, a non - 
invasive test is necessary to monitor these pat ients once they begin treatment in order to 
assess the effectiveness of the treatment . 
 
1.4. Breath Tests  
Breath tests that are based on monitoring the 13CO 2, which is a by -product of 13C labeled 
substrates metaboli sm by the liver, have been proposed as a tool for non -invasive evaluation 
of liver health and have been used for over 30 years.  
 
Methacetin may be utilized for the evaluation of liver functional capacity and/or the extent 
of liver impairment. The biochemical  basis for the evaluation of functional capacity is that 
the compound is metabolized by the cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP1A2. Diseases of the 
liver that cause a loss in functional mass and/or impact the metabolic function of CYP 1A2 in 
hepatic microsomes hepat ocytes are associated with and may be correlated to a decrease in 
the liver capacity to metabolize Methacetin . 
 
One of the most common methods for determining the rate of metabolism of Methacetin is 
to analyze the rate of metabolism of the methoxy  group (CH 3O) of Methacetin to carbon 
dioxide, which is excreted in exhaled breath. To distinguish the carbon dioxide derived from 
Methacetin from all other sources of carbon dioxide, the methoxy group is labeled with 13C, 
a stable isotope of carbon. Thus all the CO 2 derived from Methacetin will contain 13C 
(13CO 2) in contrast to all other sources of CO 2, which will contain approximately 99% 12C, 
and 1% 13C, the naturally abundant isotope. Thus, the rate of excretion of CO 2 (normalized

 CONFIDENTIAL  to CO 2) above background following the  administration of Methacetin -methoxy -13C 
indicates its rate of metabolism, which relates to the hepatic cell "health" and to the 
functional mass of the liver.  
 
1.5. BreathID® System : 
Exalenz  has developed the BreathID device  to perform automatic breath tests  based on a 
unique molecular correlation spectrometer  (MCS) . Based on specific optical -radiation 
emission and absorption by 13CO2 and 12CO2 gases, the  portable BreathID MCS device 
continuously senses exhaled breath and analyzes CO2 in  real-time through a nasal cannula 
worn by the patient  The primary output of the BreathID is the PDR (percentage dose 
recovery) and CPDR (Cumulative PDR) which quantify the amount of 13C labeled substrate 
metabolized by the liver. . 
 
1.6. 13C-labeled substrate - 13C-Methacetin:  
The substrate used in the pivotal study breath test was 13C- Methacetin  whose resultant 
¹³CO 2 can be measured in the exhaled breath. The amount of metabolized Methacetin 
indicates the capability of the liver to accomplish one of its main physiological tasks and has 
been shown to correlate with liver fibrosis and cirrhosis.  13C-Methacetin meets all of the 
qualifications for an in -vivo diagnostic test. It is a non -toxic sma ll molecule. No reports of 
any complications using this substance have been reported. The compound is considered to 
remain stable over an extended period of time.  
 
1.7. Utility as follow -up tool  
Biopsies , the gold standard of liver health  are not repeated as r outine patient care and blood 
test results are not always indicative or sensitive enough to foresee deterioration in liver 
function  in a timely manner .  
A safe, non -invasive accurate test that assesses liver function and, when relevant, show s 
trends compar ed to previous breath tests , could highly improve patient management.  
Preliminary data utilizing the MBT  has demonstrated that the results from this system 
correlated with hepatic fibrosis in patients with chronic HCV and with the clinical course in 
patients pre and post transplantation and with fulminate hepatitis.  
1.7.1.  Hepatic Impairment Score Using the BreathID MBT  
Exalenz has developed an algorithm for the scoring of hepatic impairment in patients 
suffering from a wide range of chronic liver diseases.  The algorithm developed was named 
the “Hepatic Impairment Score” (HIS). The HIS is a probability score based on breath test 
and other demographic parameters. It was developed using logistic regression methodology. 
The linear predictor of the model selected  is transformed into a probability score  of disease 
severity . The HIS is intended to be used as the device output.  
The use of the MBT test and its resultant continuous HIS for a particular patient enables the 
practitioner to assess the liver disease severi ty. This claim/label of the MBT is supported by 
several medical key opinion leaders (KOL).  
 Assessing the severity of chronic liver disease  is important for following reasons:  
 To make a timely decision to perform liver biopsy

 CONFIDENTIAL   To aid in assessment  of the risk of developing cirrhosis and its complications, 
including bleeding varices, infections, ascites, and hepatic encephalopathy.  
 To decide when to initiate certain diagnostic investigations and therapeutic 
interventions including:  Anti –viral treatment, upper  endoscopy, use of beta 
blockers for varices  and determination of frequency of monitoring of disease 
progression.  
 To decide when to begin surveillance  for liver cancer , such as  blood tests (serum 
levels of alpha feto protein) and imaging (ultrasound) .  
 To decide when to  prepar e or list a patient for liver transplantation . 
1.7.2.  Biopsy Scoring  
Repeat biopsy scoring , where available,  will be collected according to the standard scoring 
procedure at each site.  The study itself does not call for additional biops ies to be carried out.  
1.8. Safety and Efficacy of the Investigational Product  
Information on the Safety of the Investigational New Drug and safety and efficacy of the 
MBT and the BreathID device are provided in the Investigator Brochure , though no safety 
issues are expected since this is a retrospective non -interventional study.  
1.9. Rationale for the Current Study  
Timely assessment of disease  progression associated morbidity and mortality is important 
for educated /proper  management of cirrhotic patients . For example:  
 Instrumental in determining the long -term prognosis  of the patient  
 Establishing the risk for hepatic complications  in chronic liver  patients regarding 
conditions that are common in th ese patients,  such as portal hypertension  and 
subsequent  esophageal varices and cancer .  
 Cirrhosis often is an indolent disease/condition; many of the patients remain 
asymptomatic until the occurrence of decompensation, characterized by ascites, 
spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, hepatic encephalopathy or varic eal bleeding from 
portal hypertension. Thus, early diagnosis  of patients at higher risk for such 
complications  may lead to treatment that can prevent development of these 
complications  and others such as hepatocellular carcinoma, overt encephalopathy 
and liver decompensation after surgery.  
1.10.  Summary of Overall Risk and Benefits  
Since this proposed study is retrospective no adverse events and/or risk associated with the 
MBT are expected.  
The MBT BreathID system consists of the device and ¹³C -Methacetin . The same device but 
with a different substrate (¹³C -Urea) for the diagnosis of H. Pylori was cleared as a 510(K). 
The software of the cleared device was upgraded in order to allow the Breat hID system to be 
used in the  assess ment   of liver disease severity . Therefore, the BreathID device does not 
pose any increased risk to patients participating in this study.

Version 1b – April 1, 2015                                       Exalenz Bioscience Ltd                  
 CONFIDENTIAL   
The 13C-methacetin substrate has been used for various breath tests in numerous pa tients 
including special  populations such as neonatals and pregnant women. To the best of our 
knowledge no adverse events had ever been reported using 13C-Methacetin .  
Furthermore, Methacetin is a well known drug that has been available and described in 
literature for over 30 years and is currently used in medications (such as acetaminophen) for 
human therapeutic use. No risks have been reported in literature using much higher doses of 
Methacetin than currently used in the MBT.  
 
During the test procedure, patient contact with the device is through a nasal cannula for 
collection and analysis of the breath samples. Nasal breathing cannula e are a well-known  
and proven medical tool having  minimum side effects. No discomfort has been reported 
during prior feasibility studies conducted by Exalenz involving over 400 patients performed 
with the nasal cannula.  
 
The data analyzed in this study will be used to validate the hypothesis claiming a s ingle 13C-
Methacetin breath test in chronic liver patients may correlate with liver related morbidity 
and mortality. This claim had been already been demonstrated in previous studies done by 
the company, showing a hazard ratio of up to 12 between a single MBT and complications 
and mortality in chronic patients within one year of the breath test. If such a claim is to be 
validated , it is expected to influence the clinical practice for such patients preventing the 
onset of complications and death.  
Furthermore, if the second endpoint show s that the predictive value of MBT is greater than 
that of liver biopsy, many patients would be able to avoid the invasive nature and 
economically burdensome liver biopsy.  
 
In consideration of the rationale and rati ng the benefits and risks, the conduct of this clinical 
trial is ethically justified.  
1.11.  Guidance for Investigator  
The investigator is responsible for ensuring the study will be conducted according to GCP, 
ethical conduct as well as all applicable laws and regulations . 
 
We expect that the study would be granted a waiver from obtaining an informed consent 
since it is retrospective in nature.  
 
 
2. OBJECTIVES

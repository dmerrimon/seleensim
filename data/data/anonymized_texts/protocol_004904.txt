Property of UCSF -WHCRC  4 A. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
 
Urinary incontinence and cognitive impairment are common disorders in the elderly. Urinary 
incontinence has a profound negative impact on quality of life and is associated with depression, social isolation, physical inactivity, falls and fractures, caregiver burden, and institutionalization.
1-6  Urgency incontinence is one of  the most prevalent types of urinary 
incontinence and, in community-dwelling women over the age of 60, the proportion of women with urgency incontinence doubles with each decade of advancing age.
7-9 Similarly, cognitive 
impairment occurs in at least 10% of people over 65 years and in 50% of those over 85 years.10 
Drug -related cognitive impairment is one of the few preventable etiologies of cognitive decline. 
Unfortunately, anti -cholinergic medications, including anti-cholinergic bladder medications , 
have been specifically implicated in the development of cognitive decline in older adults.11-13  In 
2012, the  American Geriatrics Society updated the Beers Criteria for potentially inappropriate 
medications use in older adults to include a strong recommendation to avoid anticholinergic 
and antimuscarinic medications in this population.14  This poses a difficult dilemma for older 
adults who are at risk for both urgency incontinence and cognitive impairment, and lack 
treatment options for incontinence that do not cause or exacerbate cognitive impairment.  Recently, the FDA approved a new ca tegory of medicine for urgency incontinence, a β -3 
adrenergic receptor agonist (Mirabegron) that may have a better cognitive safety profile than anticholinergic drugs.  However, in the absence of rigorous outcomes data confirming this, older adults and the ir clinicians may doubt the safety of and appropriateness of using 
Mirabegron to treat urgency incontinence in older age.  Since incontinence and cognitive decline are common conditions that cause people to transition from living independently to assisted living facilities or nursing homes,
15 it is imp erative to identify therapies for urgency 
incontinence that don’t contribute to cognitive decline; therapies that will improve quality of life by treating incontinence help elderly people to continue living independently.  
 
Summary of the Proposed Pilot Trial 
We propose a pilot study to assess the feasibility of enrolling ~50 community -dwelling, 
ambulatory women aged 65 years and older with urgency or mixed urgency predominate 
urinary incontinence  into a randomized, controlled trial, to determine whether elderly women 
will adhere to an 8 -week drug regimen and estimate the effect size necessary to show 
differences cognitive decline between Mirabegron and a standard anticholinergic therapy.  
 
B.  STUDY SYNOPSIS  
 
Fifty  community -dwelling women , ambulatory women w ith urgency or mixed urgency 
predominate urinary incontinence and  at least 3 urgency incontinence episodes on a 3 -day 
screening diary, will be randomized to 8 weeks of Mirabegron (Myrbetriq) or tolterodine 
Subak IIT Protocol, Version 9.0

Property of UCSF -WHCRC  5 tartrate (Detrol LA ). The study will take place at  the UCSF Women’s Health Clinical Research 
Center .  
 
  
 
 C. SPECIFIC AIMS  
 
The Specific Aims are to:  
 
SA1:  Assess the feasibility of enrolling and retaining  women aged 65 years and older with 
urgency urinary incontinence in a randomized, controlled trial of an 8-week medication 
study. 
 
SA2: To estimate preliminary differences in the effects of mirabegron compared to a 
standard anticholinergic therapy on cognitive function  and calculate the standard deviation 
for: 1) a standard cognitive function battery, and 2) global patient perception of cognitive 
function.  
 
SA3:  To collect preliminary data on differences in change in physical function/mobility   and 
other adverse events associated with Mirabegron vs. a standard anticholinergic therapy, 
such as  dry mouth, constipation, vision, and falling .  
 
SA4:  Determine the differences in patient satisfaction  between Mirabegron and a standard 
anticholinergic therapy  in the treatment of urgency urinary incontinence.  
 
SA5:  To estimate preliminary differences in the efficacy  of Mirabegron compared to a 
standard anticholinergic therapy on reducing urinary incontinence frequency, as assessed 
by validated 3 -day voiding diary.

 E2. Study Medication and Placebo  
 E2.a Dosing Regimen  
Participants will be instructed to take one tablet and 1 capsule (total of 2) of blinded study 
medication once a day, orally, for 8 weeks. They will start with a Mirabegron (25mg) or 
tolterodine tartrate (4 mg ) dose of study medication and will have the op tion of dose 
escalation to 2 tablets and 2 capsules (total of 4) per day (Mirabegron 50mg or tolterodine 
tartrate 4 mg + identical placebo).   
- Mirabegron (25 mg or 2 X 25 mg) with participant-directed dose adjustment  
- Detrol LA (4mg or 4mg + placebo) with participant -directed dose adjustment  
 
E2.b Study Medication Supply  
Mirabegron (Myrbetriq),  tolterodine tartrate (Detrol LA ) and placebo tablets identical to the 
tolterodine tartrate tablets administered in the study will be supplied by Astellas , shipped to 
the UCSF Pharmacy , and labeled by the pharmacist with randomization numbers.  Because 
the two treatments cannot be made identical, the study will use a double -dummy 
methodology with the placebo identical to the tolterodine tartrate but these will not be 
identical to the Mirabegron.  Specific procedures for shipping, storing, labeling, logging and 
returning study medication and for dispensing study medication to participants will be 
described in detail in the Operations Manual.  
 
1.1.1 E2.c Study Medication Accountability   
 
Study Medication Accountability Forms and logs will be used to maintain accurate records 
of receipt, dispensing, return, and disposal of study medication.  When drug is received, the 
Subak IIT Protocol, Version 9.0   
Confidential   04/08/2016  
Property of UCSF -WHCRC  9 date, randomization number and quantit y of drug received will be recorded.  During the 
study, participants receiving study medication should be identified on the drug 
accountability form by study -specific participant number and acrostic. In addition, the date 
and quantity dispensed should be recorded each time study medication is dispensed.  
 
All study medication receipts, dispensing, transfers, returns, and disposal of drug are to be documented on the study medication accountability form. Specific procedures for the drug accountability of study medication will be included in the Operations Manual.  
 
E2.d Study Drug Disposal  
 
All doses of study medication that remain undispensed at the end of the study should be 
properly disposed per UCSF Pharmacy guidelines . It is the responsibility of the Inves tigator 
or designee to determine investigational drug accountability, complete the record and ensure that the unused investigational drug is destroyed.   
 
Specific procedures for study medication handling will be included in the Operations Manual.

E4. Evaluation criteria  
 Primary efficacy will be measured as change in the number of urge incontinent episodes per day from baseline to 8 weeks. A reliable and validated 3 -day voiding diary will be used that 
includes frequency of micturitions (diurnal and nocturnal) and incontinence episodes classified by clinical type (urge ncy, stress, or other) along with time of occurrence, waking and bedtime.
16-
18  Details recorded in diary: 
• Time arose from and time went to bed  
• Time of every micturition  
• The participant  will rate their degree of urgency with each micturition episode 
• Time of every incontinence episode  
• The participant will report the reason for the incontinence episode (urgency, stress, other)

E6. Study Visits  
 
The 8-week RCT requires 2 telephone visits (Telephone Screening,  Week 2 Phone C all) and 4 in-
clinic visits ( Screening, Baseline, Week 4 , Week 8  (or Early Termination) visit).   
 E6.1 Recruitment Phase  
 
Women will be recruited by (1) direct, community -based efforts using large media (newspaper 
notices, television ads, etc .) and small media (brochures in local businesses, talks to local 
community, notices in churches, salons etc .); (2) seeking referrals from physician’s offices 
(specifically in urology, urogynecology, gynecology, primary care, and geriatric medicine) and 
(3) purchasing targeted mailing lists.  
 
1.1.2 E6.2 Telephone Screening Interview (TS)  
 
Women who respond to study advertisements will be called on the telephone, provided a 
general overview of the study and, if interested, will complete a survey to determine potential eligibility.  Potentially eligible respondents will be invited to attend a Screening Visit to 
determine eligibility. Participants will be asked to bring all medications, including prescription  
and over -the-counter preparations, to the visit.  
 
1.1.3 E6.3 Screening Visit (SV) 
 
At the Screening Visit, women will be informed about the details and requirements of the study, 
informed consent will be obtained, and assessment of eligibility will be performed. Participants 
will be asked to bring to the visit all prescription and non -prescription medications that they are 
currently taking and these will be recorded. Participants will have their vitals taken and be trained to keep a 3 -day voiding diary and will be given baseline questionnaires assessing 
demographics, alcohol use, tobacco use, depression,  medical history , mental status and 
cognitive function. Participants will be asked to complete the 3 -day voiding diary at home and 
Subak IIT Protocol, Version 9.0   
Confidential   04/08/2016  
Property of UCSF -WHCRC  12 return it at the Baseline Visit (V1). A participant who has an abnormal urine dipstick result may 
be rescreened one time for eligibility. 
 
1.1.4 E6.4 Baseline Visit ( BV) 
 After 1 -2 weeks, candidates will return for a Baseline Visit. To be eligible, candidates must 
record having had at least 3 urgency incontinence  episodes and more urgency than stress 
incontinence episodes on the 3 -day voiding diary. The following questionnaires will be 
administered: California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT) , Digit Span, Trails A & B, Digit Symbol 
Substitution Task (DSST), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Physical Function and 
Mobility, OAB-questionnaire, and Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL). Height, 
weight, and vital signs will be obtaine d, and changes in health and medications will be 
assessed. The list of inclusion and exclusion criteria will be reviewed and participant eligibility will be confirmed.  
 
1.1.4.1  E6.4.a  Randomization   
A randomization scheme, in equal ratios of treatment groups using randomly permuted blocks 
of 2 and 4, w ill be generated by a statistician at the Coordinating Center and released only to the 
pharmacist at the UCSF P harmacy. The statistician who generates the randomization scheme is 
not otherwise involved in the conduct of the study.  Study medication is manufactured and 
identified as  mirabegron , tolterodine tartrate, or identical placebo  by Astellas, Inc. and sent to 
the UCSF Pharmacy. The pharmacist will label all blinded study drug with the a ppropriate 
randomization number and clinical trial information as specified by the FDA.  
 
All eligibility information will be verified at the site prior to randomization. When a participant 
fulfills study inclusion and exclusion criteria, the next sequenti al randomization number will be 
assigned by study staff and irrevocably entered on a participant case report form and on a randomization log sheet. The study medication matching the randomization number will be distributed. Study medication labels will com ply with all legal requirements.  
 
The study Principal Investigator, personnel involved in the conduct of the trial, and participants 
will be blinded to treatment status.  Unblinding of individual participants will be allowed only for clinically significant  reasons, and will require the permission of the PI.  Unless stipulated by 
the Executive Committee, treatment assignment codes will not be broken until after all participants have completed their final visit, trial data are edited and cleaned, and the tria l data 
set locked.

Property of UCSF -WHCRC  13 1.1.5 E6.5 Follow -up Visits  
 
E6.5. a Week 2 Phone Call  
 
At Week 2 participants will be contacted via telephone and asked if they want to stay on the 
current dose of medication or increase the dose at the start of Week 3 .  Participants will be asked 
if there have been any changes in their health or medications and reminded to complete the 
voiding diary just prior to their Week 4 clinic visit.  The coordinator will administer two 
assessments over the phone: the Patient Perception of Cognitive C hange and the Patient 
Perception of Bladder Condition (PPBC).   
 
E6.5. b Week 4  
 
At Week 4 participants will be seen at the clinic and return the voiding diary. Study medication 
compliance/ accountability and changes in health will be assessed. Participants will be asked if they want to stay on the current dose of medication, or increase/decrease the current dosage. Participants will be asked to bring to the visit all prescription and non -prescription medications 
that they are currently taking and these wil l be recorded. Study medication will be dispensed . 
The coordinator will administer two assessments: the Patient Perception of Cognitive Change and the Patient Perception of Bladder Condition (PPBC).   
 
E6.5c  Week 8 (or Early Termination)  
 
At Week 8 participants will be seen at the clinical centers to repeat the dipstick analysis, return 
the voiding diary, repeat the baseline questionnaires, and the End of  Study  Questionnaire or 
Early Termination Report. Weight and vital signs will be obtained. Study medication 
compliance/ accountability, changes in health and medical resource use (MD visits, surgery, and 
medications) will be assessed. Participants will be asked to bring to the visit all prescription and 
non-prescription medications that they are currently taking and these will be recorded.  
 
F. STUDY MEASURES   
The clinical assessments used in this study are accurate, reliable, and relevant.  Variability is 
possible in the participant -reported measurements, such as study participants diaries and 
questi onnaires that depend heavily on the participant’s understanding of and compliance with 
protocol instructions.  To minimize this possibility, case report forms will be clear and easy to 
Subak IIT Protocol, Version 9.0   
Confidential   04/08/2016  
Property of UCSF -WHCRC  14 use, study site staff will be fully trained to administer the instruments, and instructions will be 
carefully and clearly explained to study participants, both in writing and verbally.  
 
F1. 3-day Voiding diary  
 
The 3 -day Voiding diary  includes written instructions and a sample completed diary.  The diary 
has columns for recording the frequency of voluntary voiding episodes, urinary sensation scale 
(1-5), and the number of incontinent episodes by type.  Study participants will also note the time they go to bed each night and the time they arise each morning.  This diary has been used in large clinical trials and shown to be reliable and valid.
16,17,19  The Voiding diary will be 
reviewed at Baseline Visit, Week 4 and Week 8 (or Early Termination) visits.  
 
F2. Cognitive Assessment   
 
Standardized neuropsychologic tests will be used to assess cognitive function and change in 
cognitive perform ance .  The tests were selected as validated, easy to administer tests that may 
be sensitive to short-term change in cognitive function and would not create undue participant 
or site burden in this cohort.   The tests include:  
 
a) California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT)  evaluates recall and multi -trial learning and 
takes approximately 40 minutes to administer. The CVLT involves the presentation of 
one list of 16 words taken from three categories. Following a brief delay, the participant 
is asked to recall the words. Memory is then tested after another 20-minute delay.  
b) Digit Span assesses attention and short-term verbal memory (2 minutes to administer ).  
c) Trail Making Test Parts A & B (Trails A & B) - assess attention and visual scanning 
(Trails A) and executive function (Trails B; each takes 3 minutes to administer).20,21 These 
are timed, written tests with shorter test times correspond ing to better attention, visual 
scanning , and executive function . 
d) Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST) assesses incidental memory, visual scanning, and 
motor speed (5 minutes to administer ).22  This is a timed, written test requiring subjects 
to translate numbers into symbols using a key; higher scores indicate greater psychomotor speed, attention, and perceptual organization.  
e) Mini Mental Status Examination (MMSE) – simple cognitive function exam that screens 
for cognitive loss. Participant orientation, attention, calculation, recall, language and motor skills will all be assessed. Participants must score at least 20/30 to qualify for the study.

1.2 F3. Global Patient Perception of Cognitive Change  
A single -item assessing patient’s overall perception of their memory problems using a 5 -point 
Likert scale, participants  will be asked  “Compared to 4 weeks ago, have you noticed that your 
memory and thinking  are:” with responses of much better , som ewhat  better , about the same, 
somewhat worse, or much worse. 
 1.3 F4. Depression  
 
Validated self-administered questionnaire, the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS)
23 will be used 
as an exclusionary tool at the Screening Visit and will gather additional information about 
major depression . Participants must score < 6 to qualify for the study.  
 
F5. Sleep  
 Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)  
 The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index  (PSQI)
24,25 measures reported sleep patterns and sleep problems, 
including sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep efficiency and napping behavior. The PSQI is an 18-item 
questionnaire that has been demonstrated to have high internal consistency (0.83), test -retest 
reliability (0.85) and diagnostic validity. A global sleep quality score derived from the PSQI can be 
used to index overall quality of sleep over the prior one -week period. Global sleep quality scores are 
continuous (range 0 -21) with high scores reflecting poor sleep quality. It will be administered at 
Baseline and Week 8 (or Early Termination) visits.  
  Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS)  
The Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) is a simple, self -administered questionnaire measuring 
general level of daytime sleepiness. 
26 The ESS is a 8 -item questionnaire that has been 
demonstrated to have a sensitivity of 9 4% and a specificity of 100% in distinguishing excessive 
daytime sleepiness from normal daytime sleepiness.27 The questionnaire assesses the level of 
general sleepiness during eight real life situations on a 0 -3 scale ; possible scores range from zero 
to 24, and higher scores reflect greater sleepiness. The PSQI and ESS are stable measures of 
sleep quality and sleepiness over the past year in early middle-aged adults. 28

1.4 F6. Physical Function and Mobility   
 Measured with Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB)  and Instrumental Activities of Daily 
Living (IADL ) (same as used in  the Health and Retirement Study) . 
29 Clinically significant 
change includes new difficulty in I -ADL or worsening on the Short Physical Performance 
Battery (includes chair stand, balance, gait speed).29   
 
F7. Overactive Bladder Questionnaire (OAB- q)  
 
OAB -q is a self -administered, 33 -item, validated questionnaire that assesses how much the 
subject has been bothered by selected bladder symptoms during the previous week.  30  It 
consists of two distinct components.   The first 8 questions comprise the symptom bother 
score.   Questions 9 -33 comprise the health -related quality of life (HRQOL) component, which 
includes the domains of coping, concern, sleep, and social interaction.   Higher scores represent 
better quality of life. It will be administered at Baseline and Week 8 (or Early Termination) 
visits. Participa nts are not allowed to look at previously completed assessments.  
 
1.5 F8.  Global Rating of Patient Satisfaction and Perceptions of Improvement  
Two validated questions assessing patient’s satisfaction with the intervention and perception of 
improvement of their bladder problems will be administered:  31 
 
• Patient satisfaction question (PSQ) :  How satisfied are you with your progress in this 
program?  With responses of Completely , Somewhat, or Not at all  
 
• Global perception of improvement (GPI): Overall, do you feel that you are: Much Better , 
Better , About  the same, Worse , or Much worse .  This is compared to pre- intervention 
(so there is no baseline value).  
  F9. Other Measurements  
 Weight will be recorded in kilograms using a calibrated scale. Participants will be measured in 
light clothing (without shoes) to the nearest 0.5 kg. Standing height, which is measured at the baseline visit only, will be measured in centimeters with a calibrated wall -mounted Harpenden

Property of UCSF -WHCRC  17 stadiometer or ruler.  Variables that may act as predictors of the frequency of incontinence will 
be documented at screening or baseline.  These covariates include demographic characteristics (age, race/ethnicity, residency lo cation (independent, assisted), relationship status, education), 
general health, genitourinary history (duration of incontinence, prior type and duration of therapy, amount of urine loss, pad use, drinking habits), smoking behavior, reproductive health (gravity, parity, route of delivery, menopause status, hormone therapy use), medical history/ 
comorbidities  (hypertension, cardiovascular disease, pulmonary disease, stroke, diabetes) 
surgical history (hysterectomy, pelvic organ prolapse repair, other pelvic or abdominal surgery), history of falling on past month, and medications.   
 
G. DATA MANAGEMENT  
 G1.Data Collection  
A secure study database will be developed using the UCSF  Research Electronic Data Capture 
system (REDCap). REDCap enables researchers to create on -line databases for input, cleaning, 
management, and exporting of all s tudy data. The study programmer analyst, who has 
previously used REDCap to create study databases for large multi -centered studies, will create 
a REDCap database unique to our study. REDCap also contains advanced features for data 
cleaning, importing, and embedded calculated database fields and is supported by the UCSF Information Technology Service . 
 
All study data from each site will be entered into the HIPAA -compliant REDCap database 
using on -line study forms. Participants will complete questionnaires on paper which will then 
be entered by the research assistant into the REDCap study forms which prompts for missing or 
nonsensical data. Other participant data will also be entered into REDCap study forms. Missing data or incorrect values will be identified instantaneously using cross-checks in the database and research assistants will be asked to address these issues within 24 hours.  
 
H. SAFETY MONITORING PLAN  
 
The conduct of the study and safety of participants will be evaluated by an independent Data 
and Safety Monitor (DSM), Dr. Andrew Avins, Senior Investigator at Kaiser Permanente of Northern Ca lifornia.  Dr. Avins is a clinical researcher with experience in clinical trials, research 
ethics, and statistics. The DSM will periodically review the conduct and outcomes of the study and provide feedback to the investigators, with particular attention to protecting the safety of study participants.  The DSM is independent of the institution and the investigators participating in the study and has no financial ties to the outcome of the study.  
Subak IIT Protocol, Version 9.0   
Confidential   04/08/2016  
Property of UCSF -WHCRC  18  
Prior to initiation of the trial, the DSM will review and approve the study design and plans for 
recruitment, adherence, interventions, data quality, and safety monitoring.  At periodic intervals during the course of the trial, the DSM will evaluate the adequacy and timeliness of participant recruitment, evaluate the ability of the trial to reach stated goals, review adherence to visits and protocols, assess data quality and timeliness, evaluate the safety of participants, provide a report to the investigators and the IRB on the scientific progress of the trial and the safety of participants, make recommendations to the investigators on continuation, termination, or other modifications of the trial, and consider factors external to the study (i.e., new scientific or therapeutic developments) when relevant to  the safety of the participants or the ethical 
conduct of the trial.  
The DSM will periodically review aggregate and unblinded trial data after 20  and 40 
participants complete the 4-week visit.  An emergency meeting may also be called by the 
principal investigator at any time should questions of participant safety arise.  Each review will 
include an assessment of the adequacy and timeliness of participant recruitment, adherence to 
the visit and intervention protocols, data quality and timeliness, adverse effects, an d participant 
safety.   
 
Given that the study is of short duration, no assessment of interim efficacy will be done, and the 
study will not be stopped or altered for unexpected efficacy or lack of efficacy.  Interim reports for the DSM will be prepared by a n unblinded biostatistician at the Women’s Health Clinical 
Research Center, and sent to the DSM at least 5 days prior to a pre-scheduled review.  A copy of 
the interim reports will be retained in a locked, confidential file by the DSM.  
 
After each interim review, the DSM will provide a signed statement that indicates whether the 
study should continue, terminate, or be altered based on ability to meet study recruitment and 
data quality goals and participant safety. He will include any recommendations for ch anges to 
the protocol if necessary to enhance participant safety or potentiate the ability of the trial to 
answer the research hypotheses.  This statement will be provided to the principal investigator 
and will be sent to the UCSF IRB.  All materials, discussions, and proceedings of the DSM 
process will be completely confidential.  
I. ETHICS 
1.6  
1.7 I1. Institutional Review Board  
The study protocol, informed consent form, study questionnaires and recruitment materials 
must be approved by the UCSF Committee on Human Research  (CHR) prior to the start of the 
study.  Protocol amendments generated during the study must be approved by the CHR prior 
to their implementation.  The Sponsor-Institution (UCSF) and Investigator   (Dr. Subak) shall be

to the to ASMA (e-mail to safety -us@us.astellas.com  or fax to 847-317 -1421) and to the UCSF 
CHR.  
  
I2. Informed Consent Form 
Before indi viduals may participate in any screening procedures, informed consent for all phases 
of the trial must be obtained.  The consent form will explain in lay language the goals of the 
study, the visits and procedures and the risks and benefits of participating. Any amendment to the protocol generated during the study that impacts participants will be reflected in a revised consent form that must be signed again by the participant.   
K. SAMPLE SIZE JUSTIFICATION  
 Sample sizes between 24 and 50 have been recommended  for feasibility/pilot studies .
32-35 We 
plan to study up to 50 women with approximately 25 randomized to Mirabegron and 25 to a 
standard anticholine rgic therapy  (Detrol LA) .  One of the goals of this study is to estimate the 
standard deviation of the neuropsychologic battery scores as well as the potential effect size of Mirabegron against it s comparator.  These estimates will be used to develop sample size 
estimates for a larger clinical trial, if indicated.  Thus, power analyses based on a sample size of 50 were not done for this proposal.  
 
L. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
 
SA 1 :  We will observe the number of weeks required to enroll 50 participants into this pilot 
study, track the success rate of various recruitment approaches, track the numbers of women 
who are screened, found eligible, enrolled/randomized, and lost to follow -up, as well as those to 
terminate the study or discontinue study medication early,  and calculate the cost of recruitment 
per participant . 
 
SA 2:  Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) will be used to estimate the preliminary performance 
difference s on and calcul ate the standard deviation of cognitive test score s and physical 
function and mobility test  scores between the Mirabegron and standard anticholinergic therapy  
groups at week 8, controlling for baseline.  
 
SA 3:  Standard chi -square tests will be used to determine differences in report of adverse 
events at week  8.

Property of UCSF -WHCRC  20 SA 4:  Number and proportion of participants reporting much better, somewhat better, about 
the same, somewhat worse and much worse memory and thinking since study enrollment will 
be calculated.  Chi-square test for trend will be used to determine differences patient perception 
of cognitive change at week 8 .   
 
SA 5:  ANCOVA will be used to estimate the preliminary differences and calculate the standard 
deviation of change in incontinence episode frequency measured on the 3 -day diary between 
the Mirabegron and standard anticholinergic therapy  groups at week 8, controlling for baseline.  
 
M. NONADHERENCE, STUDY DRUG DISCONTINUATION AND EARLY STUDY 
DISCONTINUATION  
 
All participants will be encouraged to take all doses of study medication unless safety is a 
concern. Study coordinators will ascertain reasons for nonadherence to study medication and attempt to help participants find ways to improve adherence. However, participants who are nonadherent with study medication will be urged to attend all study visits and complete all study measurements as planned. Adherence with study medication will be measured by tablet counts at each clin ic visit.  
 
Study drug will be discontinued in any participant who has any serious adverse event that, in 
the judgment of the clinical site investigator, is possibly related to treatment with study 
medication.  Study medication may be resumed if, in the opin ion of the clinical site investigator, 
the abnormal symptom, physical finding or test has been satisfactorily evaluated and found to be benign.  
 
Participants will be considered to have permanently discontinued study medication if they 
report not taking study medication for 4 weeks or longer. In this case, study termination measurements will be obtained if possible.  
 
All participants will be urged to attend all study visits and complete all study measurements as 
planned. However, participants can discontinu e participation in the study at any time. 
Participants who miss a visit will be contacted by the study coordinator to reschedule the visit and to provide assistance in completing the visit. Participants who state that they no longer desire to participate in the trial will undergo study termination measurements if possible.

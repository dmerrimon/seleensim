1 INTRODUCTION 
The purpose of this document is to provide a description of the statistical methods and procedures 
to be implemented for the analysis of data from Gemphire Therapeutics Inc. ("Gemphire"), 
Clinical Trial Protocol GEM-201. This document is based on protocol version 1.0 dated February 
19, 2016. If circumstances arise during the study such that more appropriate analytic procedures 
become available, the statistical analysis plan (SAP) may be revised. Any revisions to the SAP 
(both alternative and additional methods) will be made prior to database lock and reasons for such 
revisions will be described in the final Clinical Study Report (CSR). 
2 OVERVIEW 
2.1 Objectives 
2.1.1 Primary Objective 
The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of multiple 
doses of gemcabene in patients with Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia (HoFH) on 
stable, lipid-lowering therapy. 
2.1.2 Secondary Objectives 
The secondary objectives are the following: 
• To confirm the appropriate dose for use in Phase 3 registration studies as assessed by 
efficacy, pharmacokinetic (PK), and safety data (an effective dose is defined as a dose that 
achieves :2::15% mean reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [LDL-C] after 4 
weeks of treatment); 
• To further evaluate the efficacy of gemcabene in patients with HoFH following 4 weeks of 
dosing with gemcabene 300 mg once daily (QD), 4 weeks of dosing with gemcabene 600 
mg QD, and 4 weeks of dosing with gemcabene 900 mg QD, as assessed by measurements 
of lipid and apolipoprotein parameters, high-density C-reactive protein (hsCRP), and 
fibrinogen; and 
• To evaluate trough plasma concentrations of gemcabene at doses 300 mg, 600 mg, and 
900mg. 
2.1.3 Exploratory Objective 
 
 
2.2 Trial Design 
This is a Phase 2, open-label, dose-finding, 3-period, 3-treatment study using successively 
escalating doses of 300 mg, 600 mg, and 900 mg gemcabene in patients with HoFH. All patients 
will be on each of the successive doses for 4 weeks at a time. Patients will remain on their current

CI
stable, lipid-lowering therapy throughout the study. Patients will not be allowed in the study if they 
are undergoing apheresis or taking mipomersen or lomitapide. 
The population for this study is male and female patients, years of age, diagnosed with HoFH 
by genetic confirmation or a clinical diagnosis based on either (1) a history of an untreated LDL-C 
concentration >500 mg/dL (12.92 mmol/L) together with either appearance of xanthoma before 
10 years of age, or evidence of heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia in both parents or, if 
history is unavailable, (2) LDL-C >300 mg/dL (7.76 mmol/L) on maximally tolerated 
lipid-lowering drug therapy. Approximately 8 patients will be enrolled into the study. Total study 
duration will be up to 18 weeks and will consist of a Screening Visit, a Treatment Period, and a 
Follow-up Visit. 
The Treatment Period is a sequential design whereby each patient will receive gemcabene 300 mg 
QD for 4 weeks. The same patients will then receive a 600 mg dose QD for 4 weeks and finally 
900 mg dose QD for 4 weeks. There will be no interruptions in gemcabene dosing when changing 
from the 300 mg to the 600 mg dose or when changing from the 600 mg to the 900 mg dose unless 
there are clinically significant safety issues resulting in the temporary or permanent 
discontinuation of study drug. The first 300 mg dose of study drug will be administered at the site 
on Day 1. Assessments will be performed after the patient has been on the study drug for 2 weeks 
for each dosing level and on the last day of each dose. 
The Follow-up Visit will occur 4 weeks (±3 days) after the last dose of study drug. 
The schedule of events for the trial is provided in Table 1.

a. Study assessments will be completed ±3 days of given time point for all study visits from Day I through Day 70. Day 84 assessments can be performed up to 3 days prior 
to Day 84, but not after Day 84. 
b. The Follow-up Visit will be conducted as a telephone call4 weeks (±3 days) after the last dose of study drug, unless the patient requires a site visit due to an abnormal 
result at Day 84 (or the ET Visit, if applicable) or an ongoing treatment-related adverse event. 
c. Procedures will be performed pre-dose. The Investigator will inquire with the patient at Day I to determine ifthere have been any changes in the patient's health 
affecting eligibility or requiring an update to their medical and surgical history. 
d. A full physical examination includes genitourinary examination per the Investigator's discretion and does not include a rectal examination. Assessment for xanthoma or 
arcus should also be part of the full physical examination. Any changes or improvements in xanthoma or arcus will be captured on the appropriate eCRF. 
e. Only for patients who had an abnormal result at Day 84 (or the ET Visit, if applicable) or an ongoing treatment-related adverse event. 
f. Vital signs include pulse rate, blood pressure, respiration rate, and temperature. Blood pressure should be obtained in the seated position, after the patient has rested 
comfortably for at least 5 minutes. Blood pressure at the Screening Visit should be obtained in both arms and the arm with the highest value should be used for ongoing 
monitoring throughout the rest of the study. If an automated assessment is performed, the same machine should be used for the patient throughout the study when 
possible. Care should be taken to ensure an appropriate cuff size is utilized. 
g. Height will be measured only at the Screening Visit. 
h. A urine microscopic examination will be performed when the dipstick result is abnormal (positive for blood, leukocyte esterase, or nitrites). Urine protein:creatinine ratio 
will be performed at the Screening Visit, Day I, Day 28, Day 56, Day 84, the Follow-up Visit (only for patients who had an abnormal result at Day 84 [or the ET Visit, if 
applicable) or an ongoing treatment-related adverse event]), and the ET Visit, if applicable. Urinary NGAL will be measured at Day I, Day 28, Day 84, the Follow-up 
Visit (only for patients who had an abnormal result at Day 84 [or the ET Visit, if applicable] or an ongoing treatment-related adverse event), and the ET Visit, if 
applicable. 
i. For women of child-bearing potential only, a serum pregnancy test will be conducted at the Screening Visit, Day 84, and the ET Visit, if applicable. A urine pregnancy 
test will be conducted at all other study visits, excluding the Follow-up Visit. 
j. Clinically significant abnormal creatinine results at Day 84 (or the ET Visit, if applicable) will also be followed-up 2 weeks (±3 days) after the last dose of study drug in 
addition to the 4 week (±3 days) Follow-up Visit. See Appendix B for a list of analytes and description of when repeat or reflexive testing will be required. 
k. Serology includes HBV, HCV, and HIV. 
I. Includes LDL-C, non-HDL-C, TC, TG, HDL-C, and VLDL-C. Fasting will be defined as no food or caloric beverage for at least I 0 hours prior to sample collection. 
Patients will be permitted to have water. 
m. Includes ApoB, ApoA-I, ApoA-II, ApoC-II, ApoC-III, ApoE, and Lp(a). Fasting will be defined as no food or caloric beverage for at least IO hours prior to sample 
collection. Patients will be permitted to have water. 
n. Patients will be counseled on a low-fat, low-cholesterol diet (NCEP ATP-III guidelines or equivalent). 
o. Pharmacokinetic samples will be collected pre-dose (must be 24 ±2 hours from the previous day's dose) and 0.5, I, 2, 3, 5, and I2 hours post-dose on Day 28, Day 56, and 
Day 84 in collection tubes containing K:£DTA as the anticoagulant. For all other study visits where routine plasma drug monitoring will be performed (Day I, Day I4, 
Day 42, Day 70, and the ET Visit, if applicable), samples will be collected pre-dose (must be 24 ±2 hours from the previous day's dose if a previous day's dose occurred). 
The window for PK samples obtained at time intervals <24 hours will be ±IO minutes. 
p. Electrocardiograms will be performed in triplicate and sent to a central reviewer. A I2-lead ECG will be performed at the Screening Visit and pre-dose on Day I, Day I4, 
Day 42, Day 70, and the ET Visit, if applicable. Electrocardiograms will be performed pre-dose and 2 hours post-dose on Day 28, Day 56, and Day 84. Patients should be 
lying quietly in a fully supine position for at least I 0 minutes prior to each I2-lead ECG. 
q. Serious adverse events that occur prior to the first dose of study drug (Day I) should be reported as an update to medical history as well as be reported on the appropriate 
adverse event eCRF.

Version Number: l.O Page 13 Protocol Number: GEM-201 
Version Date: 7 June 2017 
CI
3.2.1 Adverse Events 
AEs will be assessed at all study visits and the Follow-up Visit. Adverse events that occur on or 
after the first dose of study drug (Day 1) will be considered treatment-emergent adverse events 
(TEAEs ). Further details regarding AEs, such as the definition of an AE or serious adverse event 
(SAE), TEAEs, assessment of severity, assessment of causality, etc., are described in Section 9.1 
and 9.2 ofthe protocol. 
3.2.2 Safety Laboratory Evaluations 
Standard clinical laboratory evaluations for safety chemistry, coagulation, hematology, and 
urinalysis will be conducted at all study visits and the Follow-up Visit (only for patients who had 
an abnormal result at Day 84 [or the ET Visit, if applicable] or an ongoing treatment-related 
adverse event). Clinically significant abnormal creatinine results at Day 84 (or the ET Visit, if 
applicable) will also be followed-up 2 weeks ( ±3 days) after the last dose of study drug in addition 
to the 4 week (±3 days) Follow-up Visit. 
3.2.3 Vital Signs 
Measurement of vital signs will include an assessment of pulse rate, blood pressure, respiration 
rate, and temperature. Vital signs will be measured at all study visits, excluding the Follow-up 
Visit. 
Height will be measured at the Screening Visit and weight will be measured at all study visits, 
excluding the Follow-up Visit. 
3.2.4 Electrocardiograms 
ECGs will be performed in triplicate and sent to a central reviewer. A 12-lead ECG will be 
performed at the Screening Visit and pre-dose on Day 1, Day 14, Day 42, Day 70, and the ET 
Visit, if applicable. Electrocardiograms will be performed pre-dose and 2 hours post-dose on Day 
28, Day 56, and Day 84. 
3.2.5 Physical Examinations 
A full PE will be performed at the Screening Visit, Day 84, and the ET Visit, if applicable, and 
includes genitourinary examination per the Investigator's discretion and does not include a rectal 
examination. Assessment for xanthoma or arcus should also be part of the full PE. 
A symptom-directed PE will be conducted at all other study visits and the Follow-up Visit (only 
for patients who had an abnormal result at Day 84 [or the ET Visit, if applicable] or an ongoing 
treatment-related adverse event).

3.3 Pharmacokinetic Variables 
3.3.1 Concentration Data 
Pharmacokinetic samples will be collected pre-dose (must be 24 ±2 hours from the previous day's 
dose) and 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 5, and 12 hours post-dose on Day 28, Day 56, and Day 84 in collection tubes 
containing K2EDTA as the anticoagulant. For all other study visits where routine plasma drug 
monitoring will be performed (Day 1, Day 14, Day 42, Day 70, and the ET Visit, if applicable), 
samples will be collected pre-dose (must be 24 ±2 hours from the previous day's dose if a previous 
day's dose occurred). 
3.3.2 Pharmacokinetic Parameters 
The following PK parameters will be calculated, as appropriate, from the individual plasma 
concentrations of gemcabene on Day 28, Day 56, and Day 84: 
• Cmax: maximum plasma concentration, 
• tmax (h): time to maximum plasma concentration in hours, 
• AUCo-t (ng·h/mL): area under the concentration-time curve to the last quantifiable time, and 
• AUCo-24 (ng·h/mL): area under the concentration-time curve to the 24-hour time point. 
4 ANALYSIS POPULATIONS 
Two analysis populations are designed for the study: the Full Analysis Set (F AS) Population and 
the Safety Population (SP). 
4.1.1 Safety Population 
The SP will include all patients who are enrolled into the study and have at least 1 dose of study 
drug. This population will be used to summarize all safety data. 
4.1.2 Full Analysis Set Population 
The F AS will include patients from the Safety Population who also have a valid post-baseline 
efficacy assessment, for a given dose level. 
5 GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR DATA ANALYSIS 
is responsible for the statistical analyses for this trial. The statistical planning and 
conduct of analyses of the data from this trial will follow the principles defined in relevant 
Intemational Conference of Harmonisation (ICH)-E9 guidelines and  biostatistical 
standard operating procedures (SOPs). All tables, figures, and listings will be generated with 
SAS® (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, North Carolina, USA) Version 9.3 or higher and printed using a 
Rich Text Format (RTF) file format.

5.1 Evaluation of Center Effect 
Due to the design, objectives, and sample size of the trial, center effects will not be evaluated. 
5.2 Assessment Windows 
To summarize laboratory variables, consecutive time windows will be created around each planned 
visit. In the descriptive statistics oflaboratory variables, only measurements from scheduled visits 
will be used if values are available. If no values from a scheduled visit are available but values 
from unscheduled visits are available, the values from the last unscheduled visit from that window 
will be used for the summary statistics. The results of all laboratory values from unscheduled and 
repeat measurements will be recorded in the clinical database. In listings and narratives, all 
laboratory values including unscheduled and repeat values will be included. 
For analysis purposes, if the event date is on or after the first treatment date, the study day is 
defined as follows: 
Study Day = Event date -First treatment date + 1 
Therefore, the day of first treatment will be Day 1. If the event date is prior to the first treatment 
date, the addition of 1 will not be included in the calculation; thus, there will be no Day 0. 
5.3 Handling of Dropouts and Missing Data 
The primary analyses of the primary and secondary outcome variables will use linear mixed effects 
models. This analysis method will allow for inclusion of patients with missing values thus using 
the maximum amount of data for the analysis and making fewer assumptions about the missing 
data compared to a more traditional per-protocol analysis. 
Adverse events with missing start dates will be considered as treatment-emergent unless the partial 
date excludes that possibility, e.g. the adverse event month is prior to the treatment infusion month. 
Otherwise, the first day of the month will be used to impute missing start days and January will be 
used to impute missing start months. 
5.4 Programming Specifications 
The programming specifications, including the mock-up analysis tables, figures, and data listings, 
as well as the derived database specifications, will be prepared in stand-alone documents. The 
programming specification documents will be finalized prior to database lock. 
6 ANALYSIS OF DISPOSITION AND SUBJECT CHARACTERISTICS 
6.1 Disposition and Analysis Populations 
Subject disposition information will be summarized. Counts (number and percent) of subjects 
who are randomized, who are dosed with study medication, who complete the study, and who 
withdraw early from the study will be presented. The primary reasons for early withdrawals will

Version Number: 1.0 Page 16 Protocol Number: GEM-201 
Version Date: 7 June 2017 

also be tabulated. The SP will be used as the denominator for the percentage calculation. Subject 
disposition, inclusion I exclusion criteria and comments will be listed. 
The number and percent of patients in each analysis population will also be tabulated. 
6.2 Demographics and Baseline Characteristics 
Demographics and baseline characteristics will be summarized descriptively for the Safety 
population and for F AS population, if it differs from the SP. 
Demographic and baseline characteristics include, but are not limited to, age at informed consent, 
gender, race, ethnicity, height, baseline weight, and baseline body mass index. Continuous 
variables (e.g., age, weight, etc.) will be summarized by descriptive statistics. Categorical variables 
(e.g., gender, race, and ethnicity) will be summarized by the number and percentage of patients in 
corresponding categories. Demographic characteristics will also be listed. 
Medical/surgical history will be summarized for the number and percentage of patients for each 
system organ class and preferred term. Medical history will also be listed. 
Genetic testing results for the HoFH genotype mutational status will be listed by patient. 
6.3 Concomitant Medications 
All medications administered during the study will be listed and coded using the most current 
version ofthe World Health Organization (WHO) Drug Reference List. A listing of all prior and 
concomitant medications including the reported term, preferred term, and Anatomical Therapeutic 
Chemical (ATC) class, start and stop dates, and other relevant data will be provided for the SP. 
Concomitant medications include all medications taken on or after the date of the first dose of 
study drug. Prior medications include all medications taken before the date of the first dose of 
study drug and discontinued before the first dose of study drug. 
7 ANALYSIS OF EFFICACY 
The following efficacy assessments will be measured in order to obtain the primary, secondary, 
and exploratory endpoints: 
• Fasting LDL-C, non-HDL-C, TC, TG, HDL-C, and VLDL-C at baseline, Day 14, Day 28, Day 
42, Day 56, Day 70, and Day 84 (or the ET Visit, if applicable); 
• Fasting ApoB, ApoA-1, ApoA-11, ApoC-11, ApoC-111, ApoE, and Lp(a) at baseline, Day 28, 
Day 56, and Day 84 (or the ET Visit, if applicable); 
• hsCRP at baseline, Day 28, Day 56, and Day 84 (or the ET Visit, if applicable); 
• Fibrinogen at baseline, Day 28, Day 56, and Day 84 (or the ET Visit, if applicable); and 
•

CI
Given the proposed crossover design of this study, a within-patient analysis can be performed for 
the comparison of dose groups. For continuous variables, the dose groups will be compared on 
their change and percent reduction from baseline (using their pre-treatment baseline value). For 
binary variables such as the percentage of patients, descriptive statistics will be calculated for each 
dose group. 
Baseline lipid measurements will be defined as the average of the last two fasting measurements 
prior to the first dose of study medication. If only one measurement is available then this 
measurement will be used as baseline. Baseline for all other efficacy variables will be the last 
measurement prior to the first dose of study medication. 
7.1 Primary Efficacy Analysis 
Descriptive statistics of the percent change from baseline in LDL-C will be presented by treatment 
group at each visit, with the focus being on the percent change from baseline to Day 28, Day 56, 
and Day 84 in LDL-C, using the F AS. A longitudinal analysis will be performed with a mixed-
effects model repeated measures analysis including percent change in LDL-C as the dependent 
variable, visit as a fixed effect and patient as a random effect. The additional drug benefit with 
increasing dose will be estimated from the mixed-effects model. The F AS will be used for this 
analysis. Least-squares mean differences and corresponding 95% confidence intervals, separately 
for each of the 3 paired comparisons (300 versus 600 mg, 300 versus 900 mg, and 600 versus 900 
mg) will be provided. 
The mixed-effect model repeated measures analysis will use an unstructured covariance matrix for 
the within-subject correlation; if the model does not converge with this correlation structure, an 
auto-regressive correlation structure will be assumed. If the model still does not converge then 
other covariance structures will be explored. The final correlation structure will be determined by 
the information criteria of Akaike and Schwarz. The data from each scheduled visit will be 
included in the model. Example SAS® code for performing this analysis is as follows: 
PROC MIXED; 
CLASS SUBJID VISIT; 
MODEL PCHG = VISIT; 
REPEATED VISIT I type=UN subject=SUBJID; 
LSMEANS VISIT I cl pdiff; 
RUN; 
In addition, a scatterplot with a linear regression fit of the percent reduction from baseline versus 
dose will be performed. 
7.2 Secondary Efficacy Analyses 
Similar summaries and analyses will be carried out for the continuous secondary efficacy 
variables, assessing change from baseline and percent change from baseline in LDL-C (change 
from basline only), non-HDL-C, TC, TG, HDL-C, VLDL-C, ApoB, ApoA-1, ApoA-11, ApoC-11, 
ApoC-111, ApoE, Lp(a), hsCRP, and fibrinogen at each scheduled time point. Sub-group analyses 
Statistical Analysis Plan 
Version Number: 1.0 Page 18 Protocol Number: GEM-201 
Version Date: 7 June 2017 

will be performed for LDL-C, non-HDL-C, TC, TG, HDL-C, and VLDL-C, according to receptor 
mutation status. The F AS will also be used for the summary and analysis of the secondary efficacy 
endpoints. 
Descriptive statistics, including the count and percentage, will be obtained for patients achieving 
LDL-C reduction of2::15%, 2::20%,2::25%, and 2::30% at each visit, with the focus being on Day 28, 
Day 56, and Day 84 using the FAS. Similar analyses will be obtained for patients achieving an 
LDL-C value <100 mg/dL (2.59 mmol/L) at Day 28, Day 56, Day 84, and at any time during the 
study. 
7.3 Exploratory Efficacy Analyses 
 
 
8 ANALYSIS OF SAFETY 
Safety will be assessed using the SP. The assessment of safety will include adverse events, clinical 
laboratory assessments, ECGs, physical examinations, and vital signs. The safety analysis will be 
based primarily on the frequency of new or worsening adverse events, laboratory abnormalities, 
and SAEs. Other safety data will be summarized as appropriate. 
8.1 Extent of Exposure 
Patients will be instructed to take study drug daily according to the protocol and return used and 
unused packaging to the site at each subsequent study visit. 
Compliance with administration of study drug will be assessed by means of tablet counts based on 
the assessment of empty bottles returned to the site at each study visit after Day 1 during the 
Treatment Period and the ET Visit, if applicable. 
Days of exposure to study drug will be summarized with descriptive statistics by treatment group 
for the Safety population. 
Days of possible exposure, within a given dose level, is defined as the date of last dose of study 
drug minus the date of first dose of study drug plus 1. When the last known dose date is missing, 
the last known clinic visit date will be used. 
Percent compliance with the study drug will be summarized by treatment group for the SP using 
descriptive statistics. Within a given dose level, compliance will be calculated by the total number 
of tablets taken divided by the total number of tablets presumed taken during the treatment period 
times 100. The total number of tablets taken is calculated by the total number of tablets dispensed 
minus the total number of tablets returned. The total number of tablets presumed taken is calculated 
by the number of days during the treatment period times the number of tables scheduled to be 
taken daily for the treatment period (i.e. 1 tablet for 300 mg period, 2 tables for the 600 mg period, 
and 3 tables for the 900 mg period).

The analysis will include listings for drug exposure and compliance. 
8.2 Adverse Events 
AEs will be coded using the most recent version of the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory 
Activities (MedDRA) and summarized by treatment group, system organ class, and preferred term. 
A summary overview of TEAEs will be provided which presents the number and percentage of 
patients in each treatment group satisfying each of the following categories: 
• All TEAEs, 
• Drug-related TEAEs, 
• Maximum severity of TEAEs, 
• Maximum severity of drug-related TEAEs, 
• All treatment-emergent SAEs, 
• Drug-related treatment-emergent SAEs, 
• Death due to TEAEs, 
• TEAEs leading to study drug discontinuation, and 
• Drug-related TEAEs leading to study drug discontinuation. 
The numbers and percentages of patients with TEAEs will be summarized by MedDRA preferred 
term within system organ class, by treatment group and overall. For the summaries by treatment 
group, multiple AEs with the same MedDRA preferred term within system organ class from the 
same patient within a given treatment will only be counted once. For overall summaries, multiple 
AEs with the same MedDRA preferred term within system organ class from the same patient will 
only be counted once. The AE onset date will determine the treatment group classification for the 
AE. 
All TEAEs related to study drug, SAEs, and AEs leading to study drug discontinuation will be 
summarized in the same manner. Summaries will also be provided for the numbers and percentages 
of patients by system organ class, preferred term, and maximum severity, for TEAEs and drug-
related TEAEs. 
All AEs will be included in by-patient listings containing additional information of interest such 
as onset and resolution times, maximum severity, causal relationship to study medication, and 
action taken. Specific by-patient listings of SAEs and TEAEs leading to study discontinuation 
will be provided. 
8.3 Safety Laboratory Parameters 
Clinical chemistry, coagulation, hematology, and urinalysis results will be summarized with 
descriptive statistics at all visits with the focus on Day 28, Day 56, and Day 84. Change from 
baseline will also be summarized. Frequency counts of new or worsening abnormalities will also 
be provided. Laboratory values will also be listed by visit, within patient.

8.4 Vital Signs 
Vital signs and the change from baseline will be summarized descriptively by visit. Vital sign 
data will also be listed by visit, within patient. 
8.5 ECG Parameters 
Electrocardiogram results will be summarized with counts and percentages by visit and results will 
also be listed. 
8.6 Physical Examinations 
Physical examinations at baseline and the change from baseline will be summarized by visit. 
Physical examination results will also be listed by visit, within patient. 
8. 7 Pharmacokinetic Analysis 
A separate Pharmacokinetic Analysis Plan will be prepared by Gemphire describing the details 
regarding the PK analysis, including the data handling and methods for the analysis. Gemphire 
will perform the PK analysis and generate the corresponding PK Report which will be included 
as an appendix to the CSR.

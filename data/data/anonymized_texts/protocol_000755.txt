Directive 2001/20/EC of the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union.  
Overall Rationale for the Amendment:  
The rationale for this amendment  is to update Section 3, Inclusion Criterion 3a to allow for 
diagnosis of post -COVID -19 POTS based on a history of COVID -19, per previous positive test 
result from either laboratory -confirmed COVID -19 test (eg, a PCR test) or 
non-laboratory -confirmed COVID -19 test (eg, rapid antigen test); this positive result may be 
either documented or patient -reported.

Assessment  Infusion -related reactions  mitigation 
strategy changed from : 
“Monitor participants for 1 hour at the site 
after IMP administration.  IMP will be 
administered by a healthcare professional. ”  
to  
“Monitor participants d uring 
administration and for 30 minutes 
thereafter for clinical signs and symptoms 
of infusion/injection -related reactions. 
Infusion/injection -related reactions are 
considered AEs of clinical interest 
(Section 8.4.7). ” Monitoring requirements updated 
and r eference to AEs of clinical 
interest section added for 
consistency across the 
efgartigimod program.

IMP discontinuation. " Not required in this section; PK 
sampling requirements are 
captured in Section 8.5, 
Pharmacokinetics.  
Added allowance for participants who 
have discontinued IMP but remai ned in the

not for future research ”. Updated for clarity around what  
use of samples are permitted or 
disallowed following patient 
withdrawal from the study.

Overall Design Synopsis:  
This phase 2 study is a randomized, double -blinded, placebo -contro lled, parallel -group study in 
participants with post –COVID -19 POTS.  
The sponsor/designee, investigator, and participant are blinded to investigational medicinal 
product (IMP) treatment assignment.  
Brief Summary:  
This study aims to evaluate the efficacy and  safety of weekly infusions of efgartigimod IV 
10 mg/kg compared to matched -placebo IV in adult participants with post –COVID -19 POTS.  
After an up to 28 -day screening period, eligible participants will be randomized to efgartigimod 
IV 10 mg/kg or placebo in  a 2:1 ratio, respectively, at baseline. IMP will be administered weekly 
during the 24 -week randomized treatment period. At the end of the randomized treatment period, 
eligible participants may roll  over into an open -label extension (OLE) study ARGX -113-2105 or 
remain in this study through the end of the 56 -day follow -up period.  
Number of Participants:  
Approximately 42 participants will be randomized to IMP (efgartigimod IV 10  mg/kg or 
placebo).  
Note: Enrolled means the participant agrees to participate in  the clinical study after completing 
the informed consent process.  
Study Arms and Duration:  
Each participant will participate in the following study periods:  
• Screening period of approximately 4 weeks  
• Treatment period of 24 weeks  
• Follow -up period of appro ximately 8 weeks  (56 days ± 3  days) for participants who 
do not roll over to the OLE study ARGX -113-2105  
Participants will receive IMP weekly during the 24 -week treatment period, with the final weekly 
dose administered at week  23.

argenx  Confidential  22 2. INTRODUCTION  
The study aims to investigate the safety, tolerability, efficacy, pharmacodynamics (PD), 
pharmacokinetics (PK), and immunogenicity of efgartigimod compared to placebo in 
participants with post –COVID -19 postural orthos tatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS)  
(post–COVID -19 POTS ). 
2.1. Study Rationale  
Efgartigimod is a first -in-class antibody fragment that binds to the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn). 
This binding prevents FcRn from recycling immunoglobulin G (IgG) and leads to a reduction in 
circulating disease -causing autoantibodies. Approved by the Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA) in the US for use in adult patients with acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibody -positive 
generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) efgartigimod is being clinically developed in other 
autoimmune diseases mediated by pathogenic IgG au toantibodies.  
Efgartigimod may be a viable treatment option for individuals diagnosed with post–COVID -19 
POTS because it  has been shown to reduce IgG levels, including IgG autoantibodies, which may 
underlie some of the autonomic disease manifestations in these patients.  
2.2. Background  
The novel SARS -CoV -2 and resulting COVID -19 emerged in late 2019, becoming an ongoing 
global pandemic in 2022.1 Because of COVID -19, many patients develop chronic, debilitating 
symptoms after recovery from the acute infection.2 Multiple terms have been used to describe the 
constellation of symptoms, including long -COVID, long -haul COVID, and post -acute sequelae 
of SARS -CoV -2 syndrome. Typi cal symptoms of long -COVID include breathlessness, fatigue, 
cognitive impairment (eg, brain fog), orthostatic intolerance, and palpitations.2 These symptoms 
are often debilitating, and most patients receive disability or modified independence.3 Evidence 
is emerging that autonomic dysfunction underlies the symptoms that persist after the acute 
SARS -CoV -2 infection resolves.4 
POTS in patients who continue to have long -lasting symptoms after recovery from the initial 
SARS -CoV -2 infection has been identified in several case reports.5,6 A POTS diagnosis is based 
on evaluations for excessive orthostatic tachycardia (sustained heart rate [HR] increment of not 
less than 30 beats/minute [bpm] within 10 minutes of standing or head -up tilt [≥40 bpm in 12 to 
19 years old]); absence of orthostat ic hypotension; frequent symptoms of orthostatic intolerance 
during standing, with rapid improvement upon return to a supine position; duration of symptoms 
for ≥3 months; and absence of other conditions explaining sinus tachycardia.7 Patients who 
develop POTS after COVID -19 are designated in this study as having post –COVID -19 POTS.  
Currently, the underlying pathophysi ology and effective treatments are unknown for post –
COVID -19 POTS. Pharmacologic therapy mainly focuses on orthostatic symptoms, targeting 
blood volume expansion and stabilizing HR and blood pressure; however, POTS may be related 
to immune dysfunction and autoimmunity preceded by infection.7 Several infectious pathogens 
may be associated with the development of POTS,  including SARS -CoV -2.8,9,10 Patients with 
POTS have a higher prevalence of autoantib odies, including ganglionic AChR antibody 
G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) antibodies, which could increase sympathetic tone by

argenx  Confidential  23 activating adrenergic receptors.11 Patients with POTS have been shown to have higher levels of 
these autoantibodies than healthy subjects.12 The binding of these autoantibodies to adrenergic 
receptors has been hypothesized to cause tachycardia in some patients.13,14 These autoantibodies , 
acting as partial agonists, are thought to decrease the effectiveness of peripheral norepinephrine 
leading to an increased sympathetic response to posture resulting in postural tachycardia in the 
absence of hypotension.15  
Collectively, these data suggest that post –COVID -19 POTS could be caused by IgG 
autoantibodies that induce autonomic dysfunction. The aim of this  phase 2 study is to evaluate if 
efgartigimod is safe and efficacious in treating the autonomic symptoms and clinical 
manifestations of autonomic dysfunction in patients diagnosed with POTS after COVID -19.  
A detailed description of the chemistry, pharmaco logy, efficacy, and safety of efgartigimod is 
provided in the Investigator’s Brochure (IB).  
2.3. Benefit/Risk Assessment  
More detailed information about the known and expected benefits and risks and reasonably 
expected adverse events (AEs) of efgartigimod may be found in the current efgartigimod IB.  
2.3.1.  Risk Assessment  
Overall, available data confirm that efgartigimod IV has been well -tolerated across studies in 
different indications and has an acceptable safety profile.  
Potential clinically 
significant risk  Summ ary of data/rationale for risk  Mitigation strategy  
Serious infection  Efgartigimod reduces IgG levels, 
potentially hindering immune response 
and increasing the infection risk.  Exclude participants with 
clinically significant uncontrolled 
infections, malignancies, or 
certain viral infections 
(Section  5.2). 
Monitor for infections, considered 
an AE of special interest (AESI) 
(Section  8.4.6 ), and temporarily 
interrupt IMP dosing as specified 
in Section  7.1.2 . 
Infusion -related 
reactions (IRR)  All therapeutic proteins can elicit 
immune responses, potentially resulting 
in hypersensitivity or allergic reactions 
such as rash, urticaria, angioedema, 
serum sickness, and anaphylactoid or  
anaphylactic reactions.  Monitor participants during 
administration and for 30 minutes 
thereafter for clinical signs and 
symptoms of infusion/injection -
related reactions. 
Infusion/injection -related 
reactions are considered AEs of 
clinical interest (Section  8.4.7 ). 
Infusion/injection -
site reactions  Most AEs have been mild, transient 
injection site reactions, including 
erythema, pain, bruising, pruritus, 
burning, tenderness, edema, induration, Contin uously monitor participants 
for injection site reactions.

irritation, paresthesia, numbness, and 
rash. Moderate injection site reactions 
occurring less frequently include burning, 
erythema, pain, and numbness. Mild to 
moderate headache is commonly reported.  Infusion/injection -site reactions 
are considered AEs of clinical 
interest (Section  8.4.7 ). 
2.3.2.  Benefit Assessment  
Efgartigimod has been investigated in nonclinical studies, phase 1 clinical pharmacology studies 
in healthy subjects, and phase 2 -3 clinical studies in patients with IgG -driven autoimmune 
diseases, including gMG, primary immune thrombo cytopenia (ITP), chronic inflammatory 
demyelinating polyneuropathy, myositis, and pemphigus.  
In clinical studies, efgartigimod effectively reduces IgG antibody levels, including pathogenic 
autoantibodies. The efficacy of efgartigimod to improve clinical o utcomes in gMG and reduce 
pathogenic autoantibodies was confirmed in a pivotal phase 3 study in participants with gMG 
(ARGX -113-1704). In addition, clinical benefit was  observed in phase 2 studies in primary ITP 
(ARGX -113-1603) and pemphigus (ARGX -113-1701 ), in which pathogenic autoantibodies 
underlie the disease pathology (see current efgartigimod IB). The available clinical data support 
the clinical benefit of efgartigimod for reducing pathogenic IgG autoantibodies, which may 
mitigate autonomic dysfunctio n and improve symptoms and the ability to function in patients 
with post –COVID -19 POTS.  
2.3.3.  Overall Benefit -Risk Conclusion  
The potential risks associated with efgartigimod are justified by the anticipated benefits possibly 
afforded to participants with post –COVID -19 POTS in this study and considering the measures 
implemented to minimize risks. The favorable balance between risks and anticipated 
efficacy/benefit supports the use of efgartigimod in the clinical development for post –COVID -19 
POTS . 
Detailed information is provided in the efgartigimod IB on the known and expected benefits and 
risks and reasonably expected AEs from efgartigimod clinical studies .

4.1. Overall Design  
This is a randomized, double -blinded, placebo -controlled, parallel -group, phase 2 study.  
The total study duration is approximately 36  weeks comprising:  
• Screening period of approximately 4  weeks  
• Treatment period of 24 weeks  
• Follow -up period of  approximately 8 weeks (56 days ± 3 days) for participants who 
do not roll over to the open -label extension (OLE) study ARGX -113-2105  
The study population is adult patients with new -onset POTS post –COVID -19. 
Participants will be randomized to receive efgar tigimod IV 10 mg/kg or matching placebo in a 
2:1 ratio, respectively.  
IMP (efgartigimod or matching placebo) will be administered during the treatment period  in an 
approximately 1 -hour IV infusion  once weekly  by site staff or a home nurse.  The final dose w ill 
be administered at week  23. 
At week 24, eligible participants may roll over into a single -arm OLE ARGX -113-2105.  
4.2. Scientific Rationale for Study Design  
This study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of weekly infusions of efgartigimod IV 
10 mg/kg compared to matched -placebo IV in adult participants with post –COVID -19 POTS.  
The study design is randomized, double -blinded, and placebo -controlled to evaluate the effect of 
efgartigimod administered as an IV infusion compared to placebo. The study consis ts of a 
treatment period when all participants will receive weekly IV infusions for 24 weeks. As there 
are no standardized approved therapies for post –COVID -19 POTS, the comparison to placebo is 
justified.  
The primary endpoints are the safety and tolerability of efgartigimod in participants with 
post-COVID -19 POTS and efficacy as assessed by change from baseline to week 24 in 
COMPASS 31 (2 -week recall version) and the MaPS. Safety and tolerability are included as a 
primary endpoint as efgartigimod has not been previously administered in this patient 
population.  
COMPASS 31 is a quantitative measure of autonomic symptoms developed for use in autonomic 
research and clinical practice.16 It is a self -rated questionnaire with 31 questions in 6 domains 
(orthostatic intolerance, vasomotor, secretomotor, gastrointestinal, bladder, and pupillomotor) 
(Section  8.2.1 ).  
The MaPS score, recently reported by Fedorowski and colleagues, is a dedicated POTS symptom 
scoring questionnaire.17 The score consists of 12 questions that assess symptom burden related 
and unrelated to orthostatic intolerance (related: tachycardia, palpitations, di zziness, presyncope; 
unrelated: gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, insomnia, concentration difficulties) (Section  8.2.1.2 ).

argenx  Confidential  28 The COMPASS 31 and MaPS questi onnaires were chosen to provide a comprehensive 
assessment of autonomic (COMPASS 31) and POTS -specific symptoms (MaPS). COMPASS  31 
is a validated measure of autonomic symptoms in a common disease of dysautonomia, small 
fiber polyneuropathy .18 Prior studies in patients with POTS support the ability of this assessment 
to measure autonomic symptom burden in patients rel ative to controls and over time.19,20 
Elevations in COMPASS 31 have also been found in patients post –COVID -19 with evidence of 
POTS and other forms of dysautonomia.21,22 The MaPS questionnaire was developed specifically 
for patients with POTS by investigators at the Skåne University Hospital, Lund University in 
Malmö, Sweden. The 12 -item evaluation score is being evaluated in a case -control study in 
patients with POTS compared  to healthy controls (A. Fedorowski, unpublished data, 2022). 
MaPS is expected to provide an accurate assessment of POTS symptoms over time. Further 
validation of the score will be accomplished by its comparison to COMPASS 31 and the other 
measures include d in this study.  
All secondary endpoints complement the primary efficacy endpoints and provide additional 
information on efficacy, including measures of patients’ assessment of disease severity and 
change over time (PGI -S and PGI -C) and an established ass essment of fatigue (PROMIS 
Fatigue), which is a common symptom among patients with POTS.15  
4.3. Justification for Dos e 
Weekly doses of efgartigimod IV 10 mg/kg will be administered to achieve a maximal total IgG 
reduction (PD effect), thereby ensuring maximal clinical response on the efficacy outcomes.  
As the hypothesis for treating post –COVID -19 POTS with efgartigimod i s to reduce the 
pathogenic autoreactive IgG, the selected dose and dose regimen target a nearly maximal PD 
effect (ie, reduction of pathogenic IgGs). Considering the chronic nature of post –COVID -19 
POTS, the dosing regimen of weekly IV administration refle cts the need for chronic treatment to 
maintain pathogenic IgG autoantibody suppression and symptom reduction.  
The cumulative data from a phase 1 study in healthy adult subjects; phase 2 studies in 
participants with gMG, ITP, and pemphigus; phase 3 studies in gMG; and PK/PD modeling 
results demonstrate that a 10 mg/kg efgartigimod dose administered weekly (q7d) through IV 
infusion achieved approximately 70% IgG reduction, including pathogenic autoantibodies. 
Maximal IgG reduction was associated with clinical  efficacy observed in gMG, ITP, and 
pemphigus studies. Furthermore, this dose has been safe and well -tolerated in all study 
populations and has demonstrated similar PK and PD profiles across indications. Accordingly, 
the 10 mg/kg weekly IV dose regimen was  selected for this study.  
4.4. End-of-Study Definition  
The end of study is defined as the date of the last participant’s last visit.  
A participant will have completed the study if the treatment period (or follow -up period, if 
applicable) has been completed.

5.4. Screen Failures  
A screen failure occurs when a participant who has signed the ICF is not assigned to IMP. A 
minimal set of screen failure information (demography, s creen failure details, eligibility criteria, 
SAE reports) is required to ensure transparent reporting of screen failure participants and address 
regulatory authority queries.  
• Retesting: Participants with exclusionary clinical laboratory results, ECGs, vit al sign 
measurements, etc that are inconsistent with their medical history or clinical 
evaluation, can be retested once within the remaining screening period to confirm the 
test value(s).  
• Rescreening: Participants who do not initially meet this study’s el igibility criteria can 
be rescreened once. For example, a participant who does not meet eligibility criteria 
because of an acute illness ongoing during screening (considering the illness itself 
does not violate inclusion/exclusion criteria), they can be re screened once the illness 
is resolved or the medical issue stabilized. Rescreened participants will be 
reconsented and assigned a new participant number for each rescreening event.

The investiga tor or designee must confirm that appropriate temperature conditions have been 
maintained for all IMP received during transit. Any discrepancies are reported and resolved 
before using the IMP. The home nurse will be trained to evaluate the maintenance of a ppropriate 
temperature conditions during IMP transit.  
Only participants enrolled in the study may receive IMP, and only authorized site staff or 
designee may supply or administer IMP.  
At a minimum, the first 3  doses of IMP must be administered on -site. Th ese doses are scheduled 
to be administered at the baseline visit and the week  1 and 2 visits, but if doses are missed at 1 or 
more of these visits, then dosing at subsequent visits will also be on -site. IMP administration at 
home will not commence until af ter 3 doses have been administered on -site. 
Participants will be observed for at least 30 minutes after the end of the infusion for routine 
safety monitoring.  
The pharmacy manual and home guide provide further guidance and information for the final 
disposi tion of unused IMP.  
Accountability of home -administered IMP will be documented as instructed in the home guide.  
6.3. Assignment to Study Intervention  
Participants whose eligibility has been confirmed will be randomized using interactive response 
technology (IRT ) in a 2:1 ratio to efgartigimod or placebo, respectively. The preplanned 
randomization list will be produced using permuted blocks.  
6.4. Blinding  
This is a double -blinded study. The IRT will be programmed with blind -breaking instructions. In 
case of an emergen cy, the investigator is solely responsible for determining if unblinding of the 
IMP assignment is necessary. Participant safety must always be the first consideration in making 
such a determination.  
If the investigator decides that unblinding is warranted , the investigator can contact the sponsor 
before unblinding a participant’s IMP unless this could delay emergency treatment for the 
participant. If a participant’s IMP assignment has been unblinded, the sponsor must be notified 
within 24 hours of this occ urrence. The date and reason for the unblinding must be recorded in 
the source documents.  
6.5. Study Compliance  
Under medical supervision, participants will receive IMP directly from the site staff or delegate. 
The infusion start date/time and infusion end date /time of each dose administered will be 
recorded in the source documents, as well as the total dose administered at each visit.  
Any participant who misses a scheduled dose (±2 days) will wait to receive the next scheduled 
dose (see Section  1.3).

6.8. Treatment of Overdose  
An overdose is defined as a deliberate or accidental administration of IMP to a study participant 
at a dose greater than that assi gned to that participant under the study protocol.  
For this study, a variation of more than 10% of the intended weekly amount of IMP will be 
considered an overdose.  
The sponsor/designee does not recommend specific treatment for an overdose.  
In the event o f an overdose, the investigator will:  
• Contact the medical monitor (MM) immediately  
• Evaluate the participant to determine if IMP should be interrupted in consultation 
with the MM  
• Closely monitor the participant for any AE/SAE and laboratory abnormalities  
Document the quantity of the excess dose and the overdose duration and report any AE/SAE that 
occurred in association with the overdose.  
6.9. Prior and Concomitant Therapy  
Participants should maintain a stable regimen of medications throughout the study. Any 
medication or vaccine (including over -the-counter or prescription medicines, recreational drugs, 
vitamins, and/or herbal supplements [including Chinese traditional medicine]) or other specific 
categories of interest that the participant is receiving at the ti me of screening or receives during 
the study must be recorded and include the following information:  
• Reason for use  
• Dates of administration, including start and end dates  
• Dosage information (ie, dose and frequency)

DISCONTINUATION/WITH DRAWAL  
Discontinuation of specific sites or the entire study is described in Appendix 1 (Section  10.1). 
7.1. IMP  Discontinuation  
7.1.1.  Permanent Discontinuation  
Permanent discontinuation of IMP occurs when the participant stops receiving IMP before the 
end of the study  and does not resume receiving IMP . The participant also must  not have  
withdraw n informed consent.  
The investigator will document the primary reason for early discontinuation of IMP.  
Participants who permanently discontinue IMP will be encouraged to remain in the study and 
attend any previously scheduled visits , even if only by telephone. Participants unwilling to 
participat e in on -site visits for AE and concomitant medication monitoring will be offered the 
option to attend these visits by web teleconferencing or telephone. If the participant cannot 
attend the previously scheduled visits for any reason, the study site will minimally perform the 
EDV and the SFV  on-site. 
Unless consent from the study has been withdraw n, the participant will attend an EDV and an 
SFV. Study sites will attempt to perform the EDV within  7 days of last contact with the 
participant . The SFV will occur  56 ±3 days after the participant’s final IMP administration.  
The following circumstances will result in the permanent discontinuation of IMP:  
• Participant becomes pregnant or intends to become pregnant ( refer to  Section  8.3.5 ) 
• Investigator decides that  discontinuing IMP is in the participant’s best interest (the 
sponsor will be informed)  
• Participant develops a n SAE or AE that contraindicates further ad ministration of IMP 
in the investigator’s opinion or an AE of National Cancer Institute Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events ( NCI-CTCAE) grade 4 that is considered 
related to IMP by the sponsor  
• Participant develops a new or recurrent malignancy except for basal cell carcinoma of 
the skin, regardless of relationship  
• The participant receives a prohibited medication or substance  (Section  6.9.1 ) 
Participants permanently discontinuing IMP will be ineligible to roll over into the OLE study.  
7.1.2.  Temporary Discontinuation  
Temporary discontinuation of IMP occurs when the participant discontinues receiving IMP 
before the end of the study and resume s once the  cause for the discontinuation has been resolved.

Study w ithdrawal is defined as the permanent cessation of further participation in any study 
assessment before its planned completion.  
The primary reason for permanent  study  withdraw al will be recorded.  
The following circumstances will result in permanent discontinuation and withdrawal from the 
study:  
• Participant withdraw al of consent  
• Sponsor  request  
If the participant also withdraws consent to participate in future research, the spon sor can retain 
and continue to use any data collected before such consent was withdrawn.  
• Samples collected from participants who have withdrawn from the study will be used 
for the study results but not for future research.  
Participants withdrawn from the study will be ineligible to roll over into the OLE study.  
7.3. Lost to Follow -up 
A participant  will be considered lost to follow -up if they repeatedly fail to return for scheduled 
visits and is unable to be contacted by the study site.  
The following actions must be completed if a participant fails to complete  a required study visit:  
• The site must attempt to contact the participant and reschedule the missed visit as 
soon as possible, counsel the participant on the importance of maintainin g the 
assigned visit schedule and ascertain whether the participant wishes to continue in the 
study.  
• Before a participant is considered  lost to follow -up, the investigator or designee must 
make every effort to regain contact with the participant (when poss ible, 3 phone calls, 
and if necessary, a certified letter to the participant’s last known mailing address or 
local equivalent methods). These contact attempts will be documented in the 
participant’s medical record.  
− Participants who continue to be unreachab le will be considered to have withdrawn 
from the study , and will be recorded as lost to follow -up.

Study procedures and their timing are summarized in the SoA (Section  1.3). Protocol  waivers or 
exemptions are not allowed.  
Adherence to the study design requirements, including those specified in the SoA (Section  1.3), 
is essential and required for study conduct.  
Visits that must be attended on -site are SCN, BL, W1, W2, W4, W12, W24, IMP discontinuation 
visit, EDV, and SFV. All other visits may occur at the participant’ s home (Appendix  6, 
Section  10.6)  
All screening evaluations must be completed and reviewed to confirm that potential participants 
meet all eligibility  criteria before randomization. The investigator will maintain a screening log 
to record details of all participants screened and confirm eligibility or record reasons for 
screening failure, as applicable.  
Operational considerations due to the COVID -19 pan demic are provided in Section  10.5. Per 
local health authority/ethics requirements, the sponsor/designee or the investigator may 
implement alternate st rategies for participant visits, assessments, medication distribution, and 
monitoring.  
8.1. Administrative and General/Baseline  Procedures  
All significant findings, surgeries, and pre -existing conditions (including allergies) present at 
screening will be report ed. Complete information will be collected on medical and surgical 
history and concomitant medical conditions and specifying those ongoing at screening.  
Details collected as a part of the medical history must include but are not limited to all previous 
treatment/therapy for COVID -19 and post –COVID -19 POTS.  
Questionnaires will be administered before any other assessment, if applicable for that visit. If 
applicable, all other assessments will be completed after the questionnaires and before the 
infusion excep t the postdose PK blood sample.  
All assessments will be completed before administering the IMP infusion.  
8.1.1.  Screening  
Eligibility is based on a change in orthostatic HR with either active stand testing or head -up tilt 
testing, consistent with consensus criter ia (Section  5.1, criterion  3.a) (Shelton).15,23 Participants 
who do not meet this criterion with active stand testing may be evaluated using the head -up tilt 
test to confirm eligibility during the screening period.  In this case, investigators may direct the 
participant to withhold medications based on clinical judgment that could confound the head -up 
tilt test interpretation. The screening head -up tilt testing may occur on the same day as other 
screening assessments  or another day during the screening period.  
Blood samples collected at the screening visit may be used to validate methods to measure 
efgartigimod, antibodies, and biomarkers. Participants must consent to their samples being used 
before such procedures a re performed.

Any samples remaining after the laboratory analyses as defined in the protocol have been 
completed may be stored for up to 15 years after the end of the study, in the laboratory or long 
term storage worldwide designated by the sponsor/designee or research partners for future 
additional medical, academic, or scientific research to address any scientific questions related to 
efgartigimod, FcRn biology, or POTS, unless this would not be allowed according to local 
regulations or the participant would not have agreed.  
8.2. Efficacy  Assessments  
Time points for all efficacy assessments are provided in the SoA (Section  1.3). 
Questionnaires should be administered before any other study assessment and may be completed 
up to 1 day before the visit.  
Please see the Investigator Site File for instructions on administering these assessments.  
8.2.1.  Questionnaires  
8.2.1.1.  COMPASS 31  
COMPASS 31 i s an easily scored questionnaire to evaluate the severity and distribution of 
autonomic symptoms in various autonomic nerve disorders, providing clinically relevant scores 
of autonomic symptom severity. The questionnaire is based on the well -established 16 9-item 
Autonomic Symptom Profile (ASP) and the validated 84 -question scoring instrument, the 
Composite Autonomic Symptom Score (COMPASS).16 The COMPASS 31 questionnaire has 
been previously used to assess patients with POTS.19,20 
The 31 -item question naire requires approximately 10 minutes to administer and addresses 
6 domains: orthostatic intolerance, vasomotor, secretomotor, bladder, pupillomotor, and 
gastrointestinal -mixed upper and diarrhea.  
The original version of COMPASS 31 (longer recall) will be administered at screening and the 
modified version (2 -week recall) will be administered at baseline and all other time points.  
Higher scores indicate a more severe degree of autonomic symptoms.  
8.2.1.2.  MaPS  
The MaPS has been developed to assess the severity of the most common symptoms found in 
patients with POTS based on clinical experience and literature (A. Fedorowski, unpublished 
data, 2022). The score consists  of 12 questions that assess symptom burden related (tachycardia, 
palpitations, dizziness, presyncop e) and unrelated to orthostatic intolerance (GI symptoms, 
insomnia, concentration difficulties).  
Participants will grade their symptoms for the past 7 days using a visual analog scale (VAS) 
ranging from 0 (no symptoms) to 10 (worst possible). The maximum s core is 120 points, with 
higher scores indicating more severe symptoms. In general, patients with POTS score 
>40 points, whereas healthy controls have lower values. A score >90 points indicates 
debilitating/severe symptoms.

The PGI -S and PG I-C questionnaires are simple, participant -rated, single -item global measures 
of their perceived condition.  
• PGI-S: Severity of symptoms over the past week and overall experience of symptoms 
over the past 2  weeks (2  week recall) are both rated on a 4 -point Likert scale, with 
scores ranging from 1 (none) to 4 (severe)  
• PGI-C: Overall change in symptoms from the start of IMP to time point is rated on a 
7-point Likert scale, with scores ranging from 1 (much better) to 7 (much worse)  
8.2.1.4.  PROMIS  
PROMIS is a publicly a vailable system of highly reliable, precise patient -reported health status 
measures of physical, mental, and social well -being. PROMIS instruments measure concepts 
including pain, fatigue, and physical function.  
• PROMIS Fatigue Short Form 8a: assesses the i mpact and perceived fatigue during the 
last 7 days. This validated 8 -question scale has 5 response options, with scores 
ranging from 1 to 5. Scores are converted to a T -score, and higher scores indicate 
higher fatigue levels. A decrease in score (negative change from baseline) indicates 
improvement in fatigue.

A complete physical examination will include, at a minimum, assessments of the 
musculoskeletal, gastrointestinal, pulmonary, cardiovascular, respiratory, and neurological 
systems and general appearance, skin, and lymph nodes. Height an d weight will also be 
measured without shoes, attired in light clothing, and recorded using calibrated instruments.  
Brief physical examination will include assessments of gastrointestinal, pulmonary, 
cardiovascular, and respiratory systems and general appe arance.  
8.3.2.  Vital Signs  
Oral temperature, pulse rate, respiratory rate, and blood pressure will be recorded before blood 
collection for laboratory tests.  
Blood pressure and pulse will be assessed with the participant rested and seated.  
8.3.3.  Electrocardiograms  
Single 12 -lead ECG(s) will be obtained using an ECG machine. On days when ECGs are 
performed, this will be the first assessment of the day.  
8.3.4.  Clinical Safety Laboratory Tests  
Blood and urine samples will be analyzed at a laboratory for serum  chemistry  and hematology, 
coagulation, urinalysis, serology (eg, viral marker testing), and specialty laboratory parameters.  
See Appendix 2 ( Table  2) for the list of cli nical laboratory tests to be performed and the SoA 
(Section  1.3) for the timing and frequency.  
The investigator must review the laboratory results, do cument this review, and record any 
clinically significant changes occurring during the study as an AE. The laboratory results must 
be retained with source documents.  
Abnormal laboratory findings associated with the underlying disease are not considered 
clinically significant unless judged by the investigator to be more severe than expected for the 
participant’s condition.  
8.3.5.  Pregnancy Testing  
WOCBP will be tested for pregnancy by serum at screening. Urine tests for pregnancy will occur 
at the time points spec ified in the SoA (Section  1.3). 
Pregnancy testing in WOCBP will be conducted at the end of relevant systemic exposure (ie, at 
the SFV).  
Additional pre gnancy testing may be performed as necessary by the investigator or required by 
local regulations to establish the absence of pregnancy at any time during the study.

argenx  Confidential  45 8.4. Adverse Events, Serious Adverse Events, and Other Safety 
Reporting  
The definitions of AE a nd SAE are provided in Appendix  3 (Section  10.3). An AESI is an AE of 
scientific and medical concern specific to the sponsor’s product or program and described in 
Section  8.4.6 . 
AEs (including SAEs, AESIs, and AEs of clinical interest) will be reported by the participant (or, 
if appropriate, by the caregiver  or surrogate).  
The investigator and qualified designees are responsible for detec ting, documenting, and 
recording events that meet the definition of an AE  or SAE and  monitoring all reported events, 
including those reported by the participant.  
The method of recording, evaluating, and assessing the causality of AEs and SAEs and the 
proce dures for completing and transmitting SAE reports are provided in Appendix 3 
(Section  10.3). 
8.4.1.  Time Period and Frequency for Collecting AE and SAE Information  
All AEs will be collected from the signing of the ICF until the SFV, as specified in the SoA 
(Section  1.3). 
All SAEs and AESIs will be rec orded and reported to the sponsor  or designee immediately, and 
under no circumstance will this exceed 24 hours, as indicated in Appendix 3 (Section  10.3). The 
investigator will submit any updated SAE data to the sponsor within 24 hours of it being 
available.  
Investigators are not obligated to actively seek information on AEs or SAEs after the conclusion 
of the study participation. However, if the investi gator learns of any SAE, including death, at any 
time after a participant has been discharged from the study, and they consider the event to be 
reasonably related to IMP or study participation, the investigator must promptly notify the 
sponsor.  
8.4.2.  Method of Detecting AEs and SAEs  
Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting AEs and SAEs. Open -ended and 
nonleading verbal questioning of the participant is preferred to inquire about AE occurrences.  
8.4.3.  Follow -up of AEs and SAEs  
After the initial AE/SAE re port, the investigator must proactively follow each participant at 
subsequent visits/contacts. All SAEs and AESIs ( defined in Section  8.4.6 ) will be f ollowed until 
resolution, stabilization, the event is otherwise explained, or the participant is lost to follow -up 
(defined in Section  7.3). Further  information on follow -up procedures is provided in 
Section  10.3. 
8.4.4.  Regulatory Reporting Requirements for SAEs  
• Prompt notification by the investigator to  the sponsor of an SAE is essential so that 
legal obligations and ethical responsibilities toward the safety of participants and the 
safety of a IMP under clinical investigation are met.

efgartigimod IV  
   
argenx  Confidential  46 • The sponsor has a legal responsibility to notify both the local regul atory authority and 
other regulatory agencies about the safety of a IMP under clinical investigation. The 
sponsor will comply with country -specific regulatory requirements relating to safety 
reporting to the regulatory authority, IRBs /IECs , and investigato rs. 
• An investigator who receives an investigator safety report describing an SAE or other 
specific safety information (eg, summary or listing of SAEs) from the sponsor will 
review and file it with the IB and notify the IRB/IEC , if appropriate , according to  
local requirements.  
• The sponsor  or designee will be responsible for reporting suspected unexpected 
serious adverse reactions (SUSARs) to the relevant regulatory authorities and 
IEC/IRB, per applicable regulatory requirements. The sponsor  or designee will also 
be responsible for forwarding SUSAR reports to all study investigators, who will be 
required to report these SUSARs to their respective IECs/IRBs per local regulatory 
requirements.  
8.4.5.  Pregnancy  
• If pregnancy is reported, the investigator will record the pregnancy information on the 
appropriate form and submit it to the sponsor within 24 hours of learning of the 
pregnancy in the female participant or the female partner of the male participant. 
Contact details are provided in Serious Adverse Event Reporting . 
• The participant  (and, if consented, the pregnant female partner  of a participant) , will 
be followed to determine the outcome of the pregnancy. The investigator will collect 
follow -up information on the participant/pregnant female partner and the neonate and 
forward it to the sponsor.  
• While pregnancy itself is not considered an AE or SAE , any pregnancy complication 
or elective termination of a pregnancy for medical reasons will be reported as an AE 
or SAE. Abnormal pregnancy outcomes (eg, spontaneous abortion, fetal death, 
stillbirth, congenital anomalies, ectopic pregnancy) are considere d SAEs and will be 
reported accordingly.  
• Any poststudy pregnancy -related SAE considered reasonably related by the 
investigator to IMP will be reported to the sponsor as described in Section  8.4.4 . 
• Any female participant who becomes pregnant during the study will discontinue IMP.  
8.4.6.  Adverse Events of Special Interest  
An AESI is an AE of scientific and medical concern specific to the sponsor’s product or 
program. An AESI can be serious or nonserious, related or unrelated to the IMP or study 
procedures . These events will be reported according to the same timeframe as that for SAEs 
specified in Section 8.4.1  and Section  10.3.4 . 
Efgartigimod treatment leads to reduced IgG levels. As low IgG levels can be  associated with 
increased infection  risks , events under the MedDRA SOC  Infections and infestations  are

8.4.7.  AEs of Clinical Interest  
8.4.7.1.  Infusion/Injection -Related Reactions  
All therapeutic proteins can elicit immune responses, potentially resulting in hypersensitivity or 
allergic reactions such as rash, urticaria, angioedema, serum sickness, and anaphylactoid or 
anaphylactic reactions. As with any SC or IV injection, injection - or infusion -related reactions 
can occur during or after administration.  
Overall, the frequenc y of injection -related reactions in clinical studies has been low.   
The efgartigimod IB provides more information on infusion -/injection related reactions.  
8.4.7.2.  Injection Site Reaction  
An injection site reaction is any AE developing at the site of the injection . Localized injection 
site reactions were frequently observed in studies in which efgartigimod and PH20 were 
administered SC. The most frequently reported injection site reaction AEs were Injection site 
erythema , Injection site pain , and Injection site swe lling.   
Any injection site reaction will be reported as an AE (Section  8.4). Certain types of local 
reactions may be photographed and shared with the sponsor for review and assessment.  
As a routine precaution, participants will be trained or observed closely by a tr ained health care 
professional for any potential injection -site reaction.  
Refer to the current IB for more information on injection site reactions.  
8.5. Pharmacokinetics  
Blood samples for PK analysis will be collected at the time points specified  in the SoA 
(Section  1.3). At IMP administration visits, PK blood samples will be collected predose (within 
the 2  hours before IMP infusion) and postdose (within the  30 minutes after the end of the 
infusion). Samples collected after the end of infusion should be collected in the opposite arm 
from the arm used for IMP infusion. On other visits, a single blood sample will be collected as 
described in the SoA. Blood samp les for participants remaining in the study following IMP 
discontinuation will be collected as per the SoA for up to 3  weeks post IMP discontinuation. 
Efgartigimod serum concentrations will be determined using a validated method.

The statistical analysis plan (SAP) will be completed before database lock and includes a more 
technical and detailed description of the statistical analyses described in this section.  
9.1. Statistical Hypothesis  
No formal hypothesis will be tested in this phase 2 study. Primary endpoints COMPASS 31 and 
Malmö POTS will be analyzed using longitudinal mixed model repeated measures using the 
change from baseline as the response value. Prognostic variables are baseline and visit by 
treatment interaction using an unstructured variance covariance matrix. The treatment effect and 
95% CIs will be estimated at week 24 using an appropriate contrast. Inference will be based on 
the precision of the estimation rather tha n hypothesis testing.  
9.2. Analysis Sets  
The following analysis sets are defined:  
Participant Analysis Set  Description  
Full analysis set  All randomized participants  
Safety analysis set  All participants exposed to IMP  
The full analysis set will be used to analyze endpoints related to the efficacy objectives, and the 
safety analysis set will be used to analyze the endpoints and assessments related to safety.  
Participants will be included in the efficacy analyses according to the intended IMP assignment 
and i ncluded in the safety analyses according to the IMP actually received.  
9.3. Statistical Analyses  
9.3.1.  General Considerations  
• Data collected will be listed with derived variables. Descriptive statistical methods 
will be used to analyze safety and efficacy data.  
• Summaries will be provided by treatment assignment and overall.  
• Summaries will include the number of observations (n), mean, SE, 95% CI, median, 
minimum, and maximum for continuous measures.  
• Summaries will include sample size, frequencies, and percentages for categorical 
variables.  
• The baseline value will be the last assessment before the first administration of IMP.  
• All study visits will be recalculated based on actual dates. The rules for calculating 
the analysis visits will be documented in the SAP.  
• Rule s for imputing partial dates or missing dates will be provided in the SAP.

argenx  Confidential  52 • Exposure to IMP will be summarized by treatment group.  
• TEAEs, AESIs, SAEs, and other safety parameters will be summarized by treatment 
group.  
• AEs will be classified using the latest  version of  the Medical Dictionary for 
Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) classification system.  
• AEs, AESIs, and SAEs will be listed corresponding to MedDRA system organ class 
(SOC) and  preferred term (PT).  
• Multiple occurrences of a single PT in a participant  will be counted only once at  the 
maximum severity/grade.  
• AEs with missing severity or relationship to IMP will be classified as severe and 
treatment -related, respectively. All AEs will be summarized by  relatedness to IMP.  
• Any AEs leading to death or dis continuation of IMP will also be summarized.  
• Population PK/PD analysis may be performed based on the PK and PD data and 
reported separately.  
• Laboratory parameters, physical examinations, vital sign measurements, ECG data, 
and PK, PD, immunogenicity, and bi omarker results will be analyzed descriptively.  
9.4. Interim Analysis  
An unblinded interim analysis may be conducted mid -course at the sponsor/designee’s 
discretion. Results will be available to senior sponsor/designee staff only while maintaining the 
clinical study team members’ blind to IMP assignment.  
9.5. Sample Size Determination  
The anticipated width of the 95% CI of the treatment difference on changes from baseline in 
COMPASS 31 is estimated as follows:  
The SD of COMPASS 31 at a single time point in subjects living with POTS is assumed to 
be approximately 15, with mean score of 50.20 As the COMPASS 31 scale has favorable test -
retest reliability, the Pearson correlation between 2 measurements is assumed to be a 
minimum of 0.8.18 
From this, it is estimated that the within -subject SD on COMPASS 31 is approximately , 
from which the SD on the change from baselin e is derived to be approximately  
Therefore, the anticipated width (half -width) of the 95% CI is approximately  assuming 
complete data, which could increase to  when applying a conservative dropout rate of 
%. With an anticipated 95% CI half -width , COMPASS 31 data from approximately 
42 participants will provide sufficient precision to estimate the treatment effect at week 24.

of IMP (ie,  an eCRF has to be submitted for screen failures). All supportive documentation 
submitted with the eCRF, such as laboratory or hospital records, should be clearly identified with 
the study and participant number. Any personal information, including participant name, should 
be removed or rendered illegible to preserve data privacy.  
10.1.7.  Data Quality Assurance  
All participant data relating to the study will be recorded on eCRFs unless electronically 
transmitted to  the sponsor/designee (eg, laboratory data). The investigator is  responsible for 
verifying that data entries are accurate and correct by electronically signing the  eCRF.  
The eCRF Completion Guidelines document will provide instructions for comp leting eCRFs.  
The investigator must permit study -related monitoring, audits, IRB/IEC review, and regulatory 
agency inspections and direct access to source data documents.  
Monitoring details describing strategy, including definition of study critical data i tems 
and processes (eg, risk -based initiatives in operations and quality such as risk management 
and mitigation strategies and analytical risk -based monitoring), methods, responsibilities, 
and requirements, including handling of noncompliance issues and mo nitoring techniques 
(central, remote, or on -site monitoring) are provided in the monitoring plan . 
The sponsor/designee is responsible for the data management of this study, including quality 
checking of the data.  
The sponsor/designee assumes accountability  for actions delegated to other individuals (eg, 
contract research organizations).  
Study monitors will perform ongoing source data verification to confirm that data entered into 
the eCRF by authorized site personnel are accurate, complete, and verifiable f rom source 
documents; that the safety and rights of participants are being protected; and that the study is 
being conducted in accordance with the currently approved protocol and any other study 
agreements, ICH GCP, and all applicable regulatory requiremen ts. 
10.1.7.1.  Data Handling and Record -Keeping  
It is the investigator’s responsibility to maintain essential study documents (records and 
documents pertaining to the conduct of this study and the distribution of IMP, including 
regulatory documents, eCRFs, signed par ticipant ICFs, laboratory test results, IMP inventory

documentation) as required by the applicable national regulatory requirements. The study site 
will retain these d ocuments for 25 years minimally after study completion. The study site should 
retain such documents until at least 2 years after the last approval of a marketing application in 
an ICH region and until there are no pending or contemplated marketing applicat ions in an ICH 
region, or at least 2 years after the formal discontinuation of clinical development of the IMP. 
The sponsor/designee will notify the principal investigator of these events.  
These documents should be retained for a longer period if required by the applicable regulatory 
requirements or the hospital, institution, or private practice in which the study is being 
conducted. Participant identification codes (ie,  participant names and corresponding study 
numbers) will be retained for this same perio d of time. These documents may be transferred to 
another responsible party, acceptable to the sponsor/designee, who agrees to abide by the 
retention policies. The investigator is required to notify the sponsor/designee (or an authorized 
representative) in writing before changing the location or status of any essential clinical study 
documents. The investigator must contact the sponsor/designee before disposing of any study 
records.  
No records should be disposed of without the written approval of the sponsor /designee.  
For studies conducted outside the US under a US investigational new drug (IND), the principal 
investigator must comply with US FDA IND regulations and with those of the relevant national 
and local health authorities.  
10.1.7.2.  Quality Assurance Audit  
Study processes, study sites (including, but not limited to site visits, central laboratories, 
vendors), the study database, and study documentation may be subject to quality assurance audit 
during the study by the sponsor/designee. In addition, inspections ma y be conducted by 
regulatory bodies at their discretion. Such  audits/inspections can occur at any time during or after 
completion of the study.  
10.1.7.3.  Quality Control  
Quality control will be applied to each stage of study -related activities.  
The following steps w ill be taken to ensure the accuracy, consistency, completeness, 
and reliability of the data:  
• Investigator meetings  
• Central laboratories for clinical laboratory parameters  
• Site initiation visit  
• Routine site monitoring  
• Ongoing site communication and training  
• Ongoing oversight by sponsor/designee of safety parameters and  adherence to selection 
criteria  
• Eligibility review by sponsor/designee and medical monitors

• Continuous data acquisition and cleaning  
• Quality control check of the CSR  
• To avoid interobserver variability, every effort should be made to ensure that the same 
individual who made the initial baseline determinations completes all efficacy and safety 
evaluations.  
In addition, periodic audits can be performed as  specified in Section  10.1.7.2 . 
When audits or inspections are conducted, access must be authorized for all study -related 
documents, including medical history and concomitant medication documentation 
to the authorized spons or/designee’s representatives and regulatory authorities.  
10.1.8.  Source Documents  
Source documents provide evidence for the existence of the participant and substantiate 
the integrity of the data collected. Source documents are filed at the investigator’s site.  
Data entered on the eCRF transcribed from source documents must be consistent with  the source 
documents or the discrepancies must be explained. The investigator may need to  request 
previous medical records or transfer records, depending on the study. Also, current medical 
records must be available.  
The investigator must maintain accurate documentation (source data) that supports 
the information entered on the eCRF.  
Study monitors will perform ongoing source data verification to confirm that data entered into  
the eCRF by authorized site personnel are accurate, complete, and verifiable from source 
documents; that the safety and rights of participants are being protected; and that the study 
is being conducted in accordance with the currently approved protocol an d any other study 
agreements, ICH GCP, and all applicable regulatory requirements.  
10.1.9.  Monitoring  
The sponsor/designee has engaged the services of a designee to perform all clinical study 
monitoring functions within this clinical study. The sponsor/designee’s designee monitors will 
work following its SOPs.  
Monitoring visits must be conducted according to the applicable ICH GCP guidelines to verify 
that, among others, the:  
• Data are authentic, accurate, and complete  
• Safety and rights of participants are being pro tected  
• The study is conducted following the currently approved protocol, other study 
agreements, and all applicable regulatory requirements.  
The investigator and the head of the medical institution (where applicable) agree to allow 
the sponsor/designee’s m onitor direct access to all relevant documents.

argenx  Confidential  58 The investigator must ensure reasonable time, space, and qualified personnel for  monitoring 
visits.  
The sponsor/designee will perform an eCRF review, source document verification (wherever 
allowed per local r egulations), and source document review.  
The source documentation agreement form describes the source data for the different data 
on the eCRF. This document should be completed and signed by the sponsor/designee 
and the investigator and filed in the invest igator’s study file. Any data item for which the eCRF 
will serve as the source must be identified, agreed upon, and documented in the source 
documentation agreement form.  
Upon completion or premature discontinuation from the study, the sponsor/designee wil l conduct 
site closure activities with the investigator and site staff as appropriate, following applicable 
regulations, ICH GCP guidelines, and sponsor/designee procedures.  
10.1.10.  Data Management  
Data generated within this clinical study will be processed accord ing to the SOPs of the 
sponsor/designee’s data management and biostatistics departments.  
Case report forms are provided for each participant in electronic format (ie,  eCRF). Data will 
be transcribed by the study site staff from the source documents onto th e eCRF, per local 
regulations. Data must be entered in English. The sponsor/designee will provide guidelines for 
eCRF completion, including collecting the investigator’s e -signature, which will be provided by 
the sponsor/designee. Appropriate training and security measures will be completed by the 
investigator and all designated site staff before  the study is initiated. Any data will be entered 
into the system for any study participant at the site.  
The eCRF is essentially considered a data entry form and sh ould not constitute the original 
(or source) medical records unless otherwise specified. Source documents are those used by the 
investigator or hospital and relate to the participant’s medical history, verify the existence of the 
participant, the inclusion  and exclusion criteria, and all records covering the participant’s 
participation in the study. Source documents can include laboratory notes, ECG results, 
memoranda, pharmacy dispensing records, participant files, etc. The eCRFs will be completed by 
the investigator or the site’s qualified designee once the data are available.  
As a matter of regulation, the investigator is responsible for the accuracy and authenticity of all 
clinical data entered onto eCRFs. Before database lock, each completed eCRF must b e reviewed 
for accuracy by the investigator, corrected as necessary, and then approved. The investigator’s 
e-signature confirms that the information contained on the eCRFs has been reviewed 
by the investigator and is true and accurate. The investigator wil l be required to sign off the 
eCRF electronically.  
The data will be verified for completeness, missing data, inconsistencies, and necessary medical 
clarifications. Queries arising from these checks will be flagged to the study site, and  the study 
site staf f will correct data, confirm, or clarify data as appropriate. The sponsor/designee will 
describe the review process in a data management plan and a monitoring plan. Any change, 
including the issuing of queries, will be fully audit -trailed by  the electronic  data capture (EDC)

argenx  Confidential  59 system, meaning the name of the person, time and date stamp, and  the reason for change are 
captured.  
Data will also be provided by third -party vendors, such as the results generated by the central 
laboratories, ECG reader, etc. These data will need to be reconciled with the data recorded 
on the eCRF before it can be merged with the eCRF data into the clinical database. The 
sponsor/designee will  provide a data management plan describing this reconciliation.  
AEs, concomitant diseases, an d medical history terms will be assigned to a lowest level term 
and a PT, and will be classified by high level term, high level group term, and primary SOC 
according to the MedDRA thesaurus.  
Prior and concomitant medications will be classified according to  active drug substance using the 
World Health Organization (WHO) drug dictionary (WHODD). The generic name, the preferred 
name, and the WHO name will be assigned using the WHODD thesaurus.  
The anatomical therapeutic chemical classes will be assigned to pri or and concomitant 
medications. Prior and concomitant procedures will be coded according to  the MedDRA 
thesaurus.  
10.1.11.  Study and Site Start and Closure  
The study start date is the date when the clinical study will be open for recruitment 
of participants upon th e availability of mandatory approvals.  
The sponsor/designee reserves the right to close the study site or terminate the study at any time 
for any reason at the sole discretion of the sponsor/designee. Study sites will be closed upon 
study completion. A stu dy site is considered closed when all required documents and study 
supplies have been collected and a study site closure visit has been performed.  
The investigator may initiate study site closure at any time, provided there is reasonable cause 
and enough a dvanced notice provided of the intended termination.  
Reasons for the early closure of a study site by the sponsor/designee may include but are not 
limited to:  
• Inability to achieve the recruitment target within a reasonable time  
• Determination that no furthe r benefits are expected from the study (in the 
sponsor/designee’s judgment)  
• Failure of the investigator to comply with the protocol, the requirements of the IRB/IEC 
or local health authorities, the sponsor/designee’s procedures, or GCP guidelines  
• Discontin uation of further study medication development  
If the study is prematurely terminated or suspended, the sponsor/designee will promptly inform 
the investigators, the IECs/IRBs, the regulatory authorities, designee, and any vendors used 
in the study of  the reason for termination or suspension as specified by the applicable regulatory 
requirements. The investigator shall promptly inform the participant and assure appropriate 
participant therapy and/or follow up.

by the IRB/IEC, according to ICH GCP and applicable regulatory requirements. The investigator 
is ultimately responsible for conducting all aspects of the study at the study site and verifying the 
integrity of all data transmitted to the sponsor/designee by signature. The term “investigator,” 
used in this protocol and other study documents, refers to the investigator or site staff that 
the investigator has d esignated to perform specific duties. Subinvestigators or other designated 
site staff can sign for the investigator, except where the investigator’s signature is  specifically 
required.  
10.1.13.  Protocol Signatures  
After reading the protocol, each site’s principal i nvestigator will sign the protocol signature page 
and send a  copy of the signed page to the sponsor/designee). By signing the protocol, 
the principal investigator confirms in writing that they have read, understand, and will strictly 
adhere to  the study pr otocol and will conduct the study following ICH tripartite guidelines 
for GCP and applicable regulatory requirements. The study will not be initiated at  any site where 
its principal investigator has not signed the protocol.  
10.1.14.  Publication Policy  
All informati on regarding efgartigimod supplied by the sponsor/designee to the investigator and 
all data generated as a result of this study, are considered confidential and remain the sole

10.4.1.  Women of Childbearing Potential Definition  
A woman is considered to be of childbearing potential (WOCBP) unless she is either:  
• Postmenopausal:  
− continuous amenorrhe a for ≥1 year without an alternative medical cause  
− FSH >40  IU/L  
If a postmenopausal woman is using hormonal therapy, such as hormone replacement 
therapy or hormonal contraceptives, FSH levels could be suppressed and therefore an FSH 
test to confirm a postmenopausal state is not considered valid. In this case the 
postmenopausal state will be assessed by the investigator.  
• Surgically sterilized: documented permanent sterilization procedure (eg, 
hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy, or bilateral oophorect omy)  
10.4.2.  Contraception Guidance  
10.4.2.1.  Female Contraception for Women of Childbearing Potential  
WOCBP must use one of the following contraception methods from signing the ICF until the last 
dose of IMP.  
• Combined (estrogen - and progestogen containing) hormonal contrac eption associated 
with inhibition of ovulation:  
− Oral 
− Intravaginal  
− Transdermal  
• Progestogen -only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation:  
− Oral 
− Injectable  
− Implantable  
• Intrauterine device (IUD)  
• Intrauterine hormone -releasing system (IUS)  
• Bilateral tubal occlusion  
• Vasectomized partner  
• Sexual abstinence: a highly effective method only if defined as refraining from 
heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the IMP. The 
reliability of sexual abstinence needs to  be evaluated concerning the duration of the 
study and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the participant

Mitigation  
During the study, the sites will implement all recommendations issued by the local government 
regarding the spread of COVID -19, including specific guidelines related to clinical research 
performed in clinical research centers.  
This appendix is intended to be used only if unforeseen changes in the COVID -19 pandemic 
result in new restrictions at the site or new risks for participants or site staff from attending visits 
at the site. The sponsor/designee and the clinical site must agree to the duration of these changes.  
10.5.1.  Testing for COVID -19 
Additional testi ng for COVID -19 beyond what is listed in the SoA (Section  1.3) is not required 
during the study. However, it is recommended that participants who deve lop COVID -19 
symptoms be tested, and results reported for the study.  
10.5.2.  Critical Parameters to Be Collected During the Study  
All assessments should be performed as indicated in the SoA (Section  1.3). If assessments cannot 
be performed because of the COVID -19 pandemic, the following critical parameters must be 
collected: all AE reporting, administration site reactions, IMP administration, questionnaires, and  
safety laboratory assessments from the  first visit through the end of study.  
Analyses may be performed at a local laboratory if the central laboratory is unavailable because 
of the pandemic.  
10.5.3.  Mandatory Site Visits  
All visits designated as mandatory on -site visits must occur at the site. If adaptations are required 
because of the COVID -19 pandemic, the following visits must still be attended at the site:  
• Screening visits  
• Baseline/day 1  
− Participants cannot be randomly assigned to IMP unless this visit occurs  on-site.

IMP discontinuation visit 
were added to the list of 
visits that must be on -site. The first 3 doses should be 
administered on -site for 
participant safety reasons. The 
language has been updated to 
designate week  1 and week  2 as 
on-site visits.

4.4. End -of-Study Definition  A clarification has been 
added to note that if a 
participant continues in the 
study after discontinuing 
IMP, this will be week  23 
or at the SFV (if permanent 
IMP discontinuation is 
<56 days from week  23) The protocol has been updated in

changed (increased or 
decreased) by more than 
10% from baseline . This text has been updated to 
more accurately describe the 
criteria for redosing.  
6.6. Dose Modification  Wording added about 
recalculation of 
weight -based dose.  This text has been updated in line 
with the sponsor’s current 
standards.  
6.2. Preparation, Handling, 
Storage, and Accountability  Language was added to 
note that, at a minimum, 
the first 3  doses of IMP 
must be administered 
on-site. This text wa s updated to align

1.3. Schedule of Activities  
4.1. Overall Design  The week  24 dose has been 
removed.  This was a correction; there will 
be no dosing at this time point.  
1.3. Schedule of Activities  
8.3.3. Electrocardiograms  Language was added to 
note that ECGs will be the 
first assessment of the day 
on days when they are 
performed.  ECGs should be performed first 
because heart rate may increase 
after certain other assessments 
are performed.  
8.2.3.  
 Language was added that 
the tilt test will be the first 
of these tests to be 
performed.  POTS symptoms are more likely 
to be reproduced by testing in the 
morning.

measure increase in heart rate on 
standing.

point.  This update was made to relieve 
the burden of testing for the 
participant.

8.5. Pharmacokinetics  Language was added that 
pharmacokinetic samples 
collected after the end of 
infusion should be 
collected in the opposite 
arm from the  arm used for 
IMP infusion.  This instruction was added in to 
clarify best practice for collection 
of pharmacokinetic samples.  
1.3. Schedule of Activities  The study day for SFV was 
changed from 230 to 218.  SFV was recalculated to occur 
56 days after the do se at 
week  23. 
1.3. Schedule of Activities  In footnote b, the detail 
that the SFV would be 
60 days after final IMP 
dose was removed.  Corrected because for 
participants who remain on study 
despite discontinuing IMP, the 
SFV will not be 60  days (now 
amended  to 56  days) after final 
IMP dose.  
1.3. Schedule of Activities  The study days for visits 
during weeks  19-23 were 
updated from 134 -161 to 
134-162, and the study day 
for week  24 was updated 
from 170 to 169.  These were corrections due to 
miscalculations in t he original 
Schedule of Activities.  
1.3. Schedule of Activities  
8.5. Pharmacokinetics

8.9. Immunogenicity 
Assessments  Text added to note that 
blood samples on days 
other than IMP 
administration visits can be 
taken at any point during 
that visit.  This clarification was added as 
previously the protocol had 
suggested sampling predose for 
all visits, which was not 
appropriate for visits where no 
dosing will be performed.  
1.3. Schedule of Activities  
8.5. Pharmacokinetics  Blood samples for 
participants remaining in 
the study following IMP 
discontinuation will be 
collected as per the SoA 
for up to 3 weeks post IMP 
discontinuation for PK 
analysis.  These samples have been added 
because IMP is expected to still 
be detectable in blood for this 
period of time following 
permanent discontinuation.

8.2.1.5. Exit Interview  Language was added to 
note that for participants 
who prematurely 
discontinue the study, the 
exit interview can be 
conducted after their EDV.  This was a clarification because 
the original protocol only 
described this interview relative 
to the week  24 visit.  
2.3.1 Risk Assessment  The potential risk to 
teratogenicity/fetotoxicity 
has been removed, the risk 
‘immune modulation 
leading to incre ased 
infection’ has been 
reworded to ‘serious 
infection,’ and the 
mitigation strategy for 
IRRs has been updated.  The language was updated to 
reflect the sponsor’s current risks 
and mitigation strategy for

1.1 Synopsis  
3. Objectives, Endpo ints, 
and Estimands  The reference to change 
from baseline for PGI -C 
removed from the 
secondary endpoint.  Baseline assessment is not 
applicable for this assessment.  
8.8.1.1. Serum 
Autoantibodies and SARS -
CoV -2 Antibodies  The description of the 
analyses has  been updated.  The language was updated to be 
more specific.  
8.8.1.3.  
 Language was added to 
note that a decision will be 
made at the end of the 
study as to whether the 
samples will be analyzed; 
if not, the samples will be 
retain ed for potential future 
research.   
 
 
 
10.3.3. Recording and 
Follow Up of AE and/or 
SAE  The bullet “New or 
updated information will 
be recorded in the 
originally submitted 
documents” was deleted.  The language was removed 
because per the current process 
this is not done.  
10.2. Appendix 2: Clinical 
Laboratory Tests  Language was added to 
note that results for 
albumin and total prote in 
will be blinded.  This clarification was added 
because results for these serum 
chemistry parameters may give 
an indication of treatment 
received.

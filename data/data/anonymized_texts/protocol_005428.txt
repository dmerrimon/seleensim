NAME OF SPONSOR:  Amgen Inc. PROTOCOL No.: 20140111
NAME OF STUDY T REATMENT:  ABP 710
TITLE OF STUDY: A Randomized, Double -blind Phase 3 Study to Assess the Efficacy
andSafety ofABP 710Compared toInfliximab inSubjects With Moderate toSevere
Rheumatoid Arthritis
STUDY CENTERS: Approximately 90 study centers in Euro pe, North America, and
Australia
STUDY PERIOD: A total of up to 54 weeks, consisting of a
screening period of up to4weeks, atreatment period of
46weeks, andasafety, immunogenicity, andefficacy follow -
upperiod of4 weeks. The end of the study will be the date 
when the last subject hascompleted thelaststudy
assessment.PHASE OF
DEVELOPMENT:
Phase 3
PLANNED STUDY DATES: The expected enrollment duration is 10.5 months, and
each subject willparticipate forupto54weeks.
OBJECTIVES:
Primary Obje ctive : The primary objective for this study is to assess the efficacy of 
ABP 710compared withUS-licensed infliximab (infliximab).
Secondary Objectives : The secondary objectives are to assess the safety and
immunogenicity ofABP 710compared withinflixim ab.
STUDY DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY: This is a randomized, double -blind, active -
controlled study inadult subjects withmoderate tosevere rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who have 
an inadequate response to methotrexate (MTX). Approximately 550 subjects (275 per
treatment group) will be enrolled. The subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive
either ABP 7103mg/kg infusion onday1,atweeks 2and6,andevery 8weeks thereafter
(treatment group A),orinfliximab 3mg/kg infusion on day 1, at weeks 2 and 6, andevery
8weeks thereafter (treatment group B), until week 22.
At week 22, subjects initially randomized to the infliximab group will be re -randomized in a
1:1 ratio to either continue receiving infliximab infusion every 8 weeks (treatment group B1 ), 
or to switch to ABP 710 (treatment group B2) every 8 weeks. Subjects initially randomized 
to ABP 710 (treatment group A) will continue on the same treatment. Re-randomization will 
be managed to ensure that the blind to the initial study group is maint ained.   Subjects who 
are unable to complete the week 22 visit within the visit window of ±3 days will be 
discontinued from the study. These subjects should return for an end -of-study visit 
to complete the end -of-study assessments within 28 days , if possible.
The last treatment for all subjects who do not discontinue early will be at week 46. 
Subjects will be considered study completers when they finish the week 50 end -of-study 
assessments. An independent data monitoring committee will evaluate the safet y data 
throughout the study.

Confidential6INTRODUCTION
6.1 Disease Review
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disease of unknown etiology in 
which patients exhibit systemic features such as fatigue, low -grade fever, weight loss, 
anemia, and increased systemic measures of acute phase reactants (eg, erythrocyte
sedimentation rates [ESRs] and C -reactive protein [CRP]; Aletaha et al, 2010 ). Although 
the disease is systemic in nature, the primary target tissues are the synovial membrane, 
cartilage, and bone ( McInnes and Schett, 2007 ), which exhibit uncontrolled 
synovium/pannus p roliferation and excess fluid production, and ultimately undergo 
progressive destructive arthropathy ( Aletaha et al, 2010; Choy and Panayi, 2001 ).
The destruction of the cartilage seen in RA, and related inflammatory diseases, is 
considered to be due to th e activity of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) that are 
produced by resident and infiltrating cells in inflamed synovium ( Feldmann M et al, 
1996 ).
Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα), in conjunction with interleukin (IL) -1, plays a key 
role in synovial inflammation by increasing expression of endothelial -cell adhesion 
molecules, which cause retention of lymphocytes in the affected joint ( Chin JE et al , 
1990 ). Tumor necrosis factor alpha promotes joint damage by increasing the release of 
MMPs, particularly MMP -3 (Carrasco R et al, 2010 ), involved in the breakdown of the 
connective tissue matrix and by decreasing production of tissue inhibitor of 
metall oproteinase ( Shingu M et al, 1993 ). Tumor necrosis factor alpha also has a role in 
the bone damage seen in RA, by promoting development of osteoclasts, either directly 
through tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 or indirectly through additive effects with 
receptor activator of nuclear factor -KB ligand ( McInnes and Schett, 2007 ).
In an in vitro study conducted with synovial tissue isolated and cultured from the joints of 
patients with RA (thus containing a mixture of synovial cell types, eg, macrophages, 
Tcells, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and plasma cells), blockage of TNFα diminished the 
production of proinflammatory cytokines interleukin -1 beta ( IL-1β), interleukin -6 (IL-6),
and interleukin -8 (IL-8),and granulocyte -macrophage colony -stimulating facto r, 
suggesting that TNFα can modulate proinflammatory cytokine production within the local 
synovial environment ( Butler DM et al, 1995 ). Conversely, blocking interleukin -1 (IL-1)
activity had no effect on TNFα concentrations, indicating that IL -1 was not s olely 
involved in regulating TNFα production in RA ( Butler DM et al, 1995 ).

Clinical StudyProtocol: 20140111

ConfidentialAngiogenesis and increased expression of endothelial molecules are also prominent 
features in RA, as they are in other chronic inflammatory disorders. This is manifested 
by increa sed blood vessel density, facilitating cell trafficking in and out of the inflamed 
tissue ( Tracey D et al, 2008 ).
6.2 Infliximab
Remicade®(infliximab) is a chimeric human- murine monoclonal antibody that binds with 
high affinity to both soluble and transmembra ne forms of TNFα, but not to lymphotoxin α 
(REMICADE Prescribing Information ). Elevated concentrations of TNFα have been
found in the joints of patients with RA and correlate with elevated disease activity. In 
RA, treatment with infliximab reduced infilt ration of inflammatory cells into inflamed areas 
of the joint, as well as reduced expression of molecules mediating cellular adhesion,
chemo- attraction, and tissue degradation. After infliximab treatment, patients with RA 
exhibited decreased concentrations of serum IL -6 and CRP; and patients with reduced 
hemoglobin concentrations had increased hemoglobin concentrations compared with 
baseline. Peripheral blood lymphocytes showed no significant decrease in number or in 
proliferative responses to in vitro mi togenic stimulation when compared with untreated 
patients’ cells.
Infliximab, in combination with methotrexate (MTX), is indicated for the reduction of signs 
and symptoms of RA, as well as the improvement in physical function in adult patients 
with active disease when the response to disease -modifying antirheumatic drugs 
(DMARDs), including MTX, has been inadequate and in adult patients with severe,
active and progressive disease not previously treated with MTX or other DMARDs 
(REMICADE Prescribing Informat ion).
6.3 Compound Review
ABP 710 is being developed as a biosimilar candidate to Remicade®(infliximab) for the 
treatment of RA and other indications: Crohn’s disease (adults/pediatrics), ulcerative 
colitis (adults/pediatrics), ankylosing spondylitis (adults) , psoriatic arthritis (adults), and 
plaque psoriasis (adults). The active ingredient of ABP 710 is a monoclonal antibody 
that has the same amino acid sequence as infliximab. ABP 710 has the same 
pharmaceutical form and dosage strength as infliximab.
Similarity of ABP 710 to infliximab has been shown in analytical assessments. ABP 710 
and infliximab have similar binding affinity for human TNFα and comparable inhibition of 
TNFα as assessed in vitro in the human histiocytic lymphoma cell line U -937. ABP 71 0

Confidentialand infliximab also show similar in vitro binding to the fragme nt crystallizable (Fc) 
neonatal receptor and Fc gamma receptor Type IIIa, and similar antibody-dependent 
cell-mediated cytotoxicity and complement-dependent cytotoxicit y activity in vitro. In a 
toxicology study in rats, administration of ABP 710 or inflixim ab was similarly well 
tolerated at doses of up to 50 mg/kg for 2 weeks. In the absenc e of pharmacologically 
relevant preclinical species to evaluate on-target effects in v ivo, ABP 710 and infliximab 
demonstrated a similar lack of activity in an in vitro cytokine  release assay with human 
peripheral blood leukocytes and endothelial cells. Refer to the  investigator’s brochure 
(IB) for additional information about ABP 710 and its comparabi lity with infliximab.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Adverse events that may be serious or fatal include serious inf ections including new 
onset or reactivation of tuberculosis, reactivation of hepatiti s B, sepsis, malignancies 
including lymphomas (such as hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma), se rious infusion 
reactions including delayed K\SHUVHQVLWLYLW\ , hepatotoxicity, heart failure, hematologic 
reactions, and demyelinating disorders. Based on clinical trial  experience in infliximab-
treated adult subjects across multiple indications, frequently reported (≥ 10% subject 
incidence) adverse reactions included viral infections, headach e, upper respiratory tract 
infection, sinusitis, abdominal pain, nausea, infusion-related reaction, and pain. Based 
on clinical trial experience in subjects with RA, the most comm on (≥ 10% subject 
incidence) adverse reactions in those receiving 4 or more infus ions of infliximab were 
nausea, abdominal pain, diarrhea, dyspepsia, upper respiratory tract infection, sinusitis, 
pharyngitis, coughing, bronchitis, rash, and headache ( ABP 710 Investigator’s Brochure,

Confidential6.4 Study Rationale
In the US, EU, an d much of the world, laws, regulations, and guidances have been or 
are being put in place to increase availability of biological treatments by developing and 
licensing biosimilar products ( EMA/CHMP/437/04 Rev 1; 
EMA/CHMP/B WP/247713/2012 Rev 1; EMEA/CHMP/BM WP/42832/2005 Rev.1; 
EMEA/CHMP/BM WP/403543/2010 Rev. 1; US FDA 2015a; US FDA 2015b ). A
biosimilar product, generally, is highly similar to a licensed biologic reference product, 
and there are no clinically meaningful differences between the biosimilar and reference 
products in terms of safety, purity, and potency. Biosimilarity is demonstrated by the 
totality of the evidence, including analytical, nonclinical, and clinical evidence. The 
analytical and pharmacokinetic similarity of ABP 710 and infliximab are summarized 
briefly in more detail in the IB.
A phase 1 study of ABP 710 compared with infliximab (US) and infliximab (EU) (Study 
20140108) was conducted in 148 healthy adult men and women. Subjects received a 
single 5 mg/kg IV infusion of ABP 710, inf liximab (US), or infliximab (EU), and were 
followed for 57 days after infusion. A similar safety profile was seen across the
3treatment groups. Overall, all treatments were safe and well tolerated. The most 
common treatment -emergent adverse events were somnolence (53.4%), headache 
(31.8%), nasopharyngitis (8.8%), upper respiratory tract infection (4.7%), and nausea 
(4.2%).  The percentage of subjects who were positive for binding antibodies was 
42.9%, 36.0% and 32.7% for ABP 710, infliximab (US) and inf liximab (EU), respectively. 
Thus, it is expected that the safety profile of ABP 710 is similar to that of infliximab.
The current study is designed to demonstrate the clinical similarity between ABP 710 
and infliximab in terms of efficacy, safety, and imm unogenicity for moderate and severe 
RA and in accordance with the biosimilar regulations and guidance ( EMA/CHMP/437/04 
Rev.1; EMA/CHMP/BW P/247713/2012 Rev 1; EMEA/CHMP/BM WP/42832/2005 Rev.1; 
EMEA/CHMP/BM WP/403543/2010 Rev 1; US FDA 2015a; US FDA 2015b ).

Confidential8INVESTIGA TIONA LPLAN
8.1 Overall Study Design and Plan
This is a randomized, double -blind, active -controlled study in adult subjects with 
moderate to severe RA who have an inadequate response to MTX. Approximately 
550subjects (275 per treatment group) will be enrolled. The subjects will be randomized 
in a 1:1 ratio to receive either ABP 710 3 mg/kg infusion on day 1, at weeks 2 and 6, and 
every 8 weeks thereafter (treatment group A), or infliximab 3 mg/kg infusion on day 1, at 
weeks 2 and 6, and every 8 weeks thereafter (treatment group B), until week 22.
At week 22, subjects initially randomized to the infliximab group will be re -randomized in 
a 1:1 ratio to either continue receiving infliximab infusion every 8 weeks (treatment group 
B1), or to switch to ABP 710 (treatment group B2).  Subjects initially randomized to 
ABP 710 (treatment group A) will continue on the same treatment. Re-randomization 
will be managed to ensure that the blind to the initial study group is maintained.   
Subjects who are unable to complete the week 22 visit within the visit window 
of±3days will be discontinued from the study.   These subjects should return 
for an end of study visit to complete the end -of-study assessments within 28 
days ,if possible. The last treatment for all subjects who do not discontinue early will 
be at week 46. Subjects will be considered study completers when they finish the week 
50 end -of-study assessments.
Subjects will complete a screening period of up to 4 weeks, receive investigational 
product for 46 weeks, and complete an efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity follow -up 
period of 4 weeks for a total study duration of up to 54 weeks.
An independent data monitoring committee (DMC) will evaluate the safety data 
throu ghout the study. The primary analysis will be conducted at week 34. The end of 
the study will be at week 50, and a final analysis will be conducted when all subjects 
have completed the week 50/end -of-study assessments (or are terminated early from 
the st udy).  Study completion is defined as completion of the week 50 visit.

8.2 Discussion of Study Design
This study is randomized and double -blinded to prevent bias in treatment allocation and 
in the subjective assessment of effect. The primary analysis will be conducted after all 
subjects have either completed the week 34 assessments, or been terminated from the 
study before week 34.
8.3 Study Duration
The study consists of a screening period of up to 4 weeks, a treatment period of 46 
weeks, and a safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy follow -up period through to week 50 
for a total of up to 54 weeks.
Enrollment will continue until approximately 550 subjects (275 per treatment group) have 
been randomized to treatment. The end of the study will be the date when the last 
subject has completed the last study assessment.

8.4.3 Withdrawal and Replacement of Subjects
8.4.3.1 Criteria for Subject Withdrawal
Subjects have the right to withdraw from the study at any t ime and for any reason 
without prejudice to future medical care by the physician or at the institution.
Subjects (or a legally acceptable representative) can decline to continue receiving 
investigational product and/or other protocol -required therapies or procedures at any 
time during the study, but continue participating in the study. If this occurs, the 
investigator is to discuss with the subject the appropriate processes for discontinuation 
from investigational product or other protocol -required therapi es and must discuss with 
the subject the options for continuation of the Schedule of Assessments and Procedures 
(Table 8-1) and collection of data, including endpoints and adverse events. The 
investigator must do cument the change to the Schedule of Assessments and

ConfidentialProcedures ( Table 8-1 ) and the level of follow -up that is agreed to by the subject (eg, in 
person, by telephone/mail, through family/friends, in correspondence/ communication 
with other physicians, from review of the medical records).
Withdrawal of consent for a study means that the subject does not wish to receive 
further protocol -required therapies or procedures, and the subject does not wish to or is 
unable to continue further study participation. Subject data up to withdrawal of consent 
will be included in the analysis of the study and, where permitted, publically available 
data can be included after withdrawal of consent. The investigator is to discuss with the 
subject appropriate procedures for withdrawal from the study.
Reasons for removal from protocol -required investigational products or procedural 
assessments might include:
inability to complete the week 22 visit within the allowed visit window 
subject request to end investigational product administration
safety concern (eg, an adverse event, failure to follow contraception, and/or 
protocol requirements)
pregnancy
Subjects who discontinued treatment because of inability  to complete the w eek 22 
visit within the allo wed visit windo w should return for a nend-of-study visit to 
complete the end-of-study assessments within 28 day s,if possible.
Reasons for removal of a subject from the study might include:
withdrawal of consent from study
lost to follow -up
decision by sponsor
8.4.3.2 Evaluations at Withdrawal
For any subject who is withdrawn before completing all study visits, the investigator 
should:
Perform all the procedures scheduled for the week 50/end -of-study visit. 
These assessments will be performed no later t han 28 days after 
withdrawal/discontinuation (unless the subject withdraws consent to do so).
Complete all appropriate electronic case report form (eCRF) screens, 
providing the date of and explanation for the subject’s 
withdrawal/discontinuation.

ConfidentialWhen indi cated, arrange for appropriate follow -up and/or alternative 
medical care for the discontinued subject.
If the subject fails to attend a scheduled termination or follow -up visit, there will be at 
least 2 attempts to contact the subject via telephone and 2 w ritten communications. If 
these receive no reply, the subject will be considered lost to follow -up.
8.4.3.3 Replacement of Subjects
Subjects who are withdrawn will not be replaced. However, a sufficient number of 
subjects will be included to ensure that the mini mum defined sample size is reached 
(see Section 12.2).
8.5 Treatments
8.5.1 Treatments Administered
The investigator must ensure that the investigational products will be used only in 
accord ance with the protocol.
ABP 710 is a chimeric human/murine monoclonal antibody with the same amino acid 
sequence as infliximab.
Subjects will initially be randomly assigned at baseline (day 1) to 1 of 2 treatment 
groups, as follows:
treatment A: ABP 710, 3 mg/kg IV infusion
treatment B: Infliximab, 3 mg/kg IV infusion
In both treatment groups, doses will be administered by study center staff on day 1, 
weeks 2 and 6, and then every 8 weeks thereafter until week 22. At week 22, subjects 
initially randomized to the infliximab group will be re -randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either 
continue receiving infliximab infusion every 8 weeks (treatment group B1), or switch to 
ABP 710 (treatment group B2) every 8 weeks. Subjects initially randomized to ABP 710 
will contin ue on the same treatment.
No dose reductions or changes will be allowed, except for weight -based dosing 
changes.
Premedications must be given .  Premedications should be selected according to local 
practice and /orthe approved product label for infliximab. These medications should 
generally include acetaminophen and an antihistamine and methylprednisone 100 mg IV

Confidentialor equivalent approximately  30 minutes before each infusion but should be selected 
according to the individual subject ’s needs.
Intravenous infusi ons should be performed according to local practice and the approved 
product label for infliximab.
Investigational product infusion reactions should be handled according to local practice 
and the approved product label for infliximab.
ABP 710/infliximab wi ll be administered after all other procedures have been completed 
for each visit. If the subject presents with an infection at the dosing visit(s), the 
administration of investigational product may be delayed (up to 5 days). If a dose is 
delayed or misse d for any reason, subsequent doses should be administered at the 
original scheduled dosing dates in relation to the first dose date.
All subjects will continue on a stable dose of MTX (7.5 to 25 mg/week, oral, or 
subcutaneous) for the duration of their par ticipation in the study, as prescribed by the 
treating physician. When possible, the dose of MTX should be taken on the same day of 
the week. In the event that a subject develops MTX -related side effects (eg, 
mucositis/stomatitis), a dose reduction or ch ange of  route should be considered, as 
deemed appropriate by the investigator. Please see Section 8.5.7.4 for folate/folinic 
acid.
8.5.2 Study Treatment Formulation
8.5.2.1 Study Drug
ABP 710 is a human/murine chimeric monoclonal IgG1 antibody that binds with high 
affinity to both soluble and transmembrane forms of TNFα and has the same amino acid 
sequence as infliximab. ABP 710 and infliximab are manufactured by recombinant DNA 
technology, and ABP 710 is expre ssed in a Chinese hamster ovary cell line and purified 
by a suitable process.
ABP 710 is supplied as a sterile, white, lyophilized powder for IV infusion requiring 
reconstitution prior to infusion with 10 mL of Sterile W ater for injection. Each single -use
vial contains 100 mg ABP 710, 500 mg sucrose, 0.5 mg polysorbate 80, 2.2 mg 
monobasic sodium phosphate, monohydrate, and 6.1 mg dibasic sodium phosphate,

Infliximab, the active ingredient in Remicade®, is a chimeric IgG1 kappa monoclonal 
antibody (composed of human constant and murine variable region s) specific for human 
TNFα. It has a molecular weight of approximately 149.1 kD and a  binding affinity for 
soluble TNFα of approximately K(D)=4.2 picomolars, as measured by KinExA 
technology. Infliximab is produced by a recombinant cell line c ultured by continuous 
perfusion and is purified by a series of steps that includes me asures to inactivate and 
remove viruses.
Infliximab is supplied as a sterile, white, lyophilized powder for IV infusion. After 
reconstitution with mL Sterile Water for Injection, USP, the re sulting pH is 
approximately . Each single-use vial contains 100 mg infliximab,   mg sucrose,

8.5.6 Dose A djustments and Dose Escalation
No dose reductions or escalations are planned for the investigational products used in 
this study, except for weight -based dosing changes.
8.5.7 Prior and Concomit ant Therapy
8.5.7.1 Permitted Concomitant Treatments (Medications and 
Therapies)
The following concomitant medications are permitted:
methotrexate as specified in Section 8.5.1
oral corticosteroids at a do se of ≤ 10 mg prednisone, or equivalent, per day 
are permitted provided they are at a stable dose for at least 4 weeks before 
initiation of investigational product. The dose of oral corticosteroids may be 
reduced according to local guidelines during the c onduct of the study
nonlive vaccinations are allowed any time throughout the study
If at any time a subject clinically needs additional therapy (other than those specified in 
Section 8.5.7.3 ), incl uding a significant increase in the MTX dose to treat RA, the 
investigator should contact the Amgen medical monitor (or designee) to determine if the 
subject is eligible to remain on investigational product. If the subject is no longer eligible 
to remain on investigational product, then the subject should undergo the evaluations 
and procedures described in Section 8.4.3.2 .
8.5.7.2 Prohibited Concomitant Medications
All of the following are prohibited at an y time during the study:
nonbiologic DMARDs (other than MTX; as per exclusion criteria)
any biologic treatment for RA (eg, anakinra, soluble IL -1 type II receptor, 
etanercept, infliximab [except for investigational product], onercept, 
abatacept, tocilzumab , golimumab, certolizumab, rituximab, and 
adalimumab)
chronic minocycline or tetracycline (except use for ≤ 10 days to treat 
infection, or for nonarthritis indications, eg, acne), hydroxychloroquine, 
mycophenolate mofetil, or sulfasalazine
live and attenua ted vaccinations are not allowed while subjects are enrolled

8.5.7.3 Rescue Medication
The definition of rescue medication is any medication other than prohibited medication 
that is used to treat RA. The use of rescue med ication is allowed in this study under the 
following conditions:
oral corticosteroids: the maximum dose allowed is 10 mg prednisone (or 
equivalent) per day; the dose can be decreased if needed, per the 
investigator’s clinical judgment
acetaminophen, hydroc odone, codeine, tramadol, and/or propoxyphene 
may be used by the subject as rescue analgesics. However, no rescue 
analgesics will be allowed within 12 hours before clinical efficacy 
assessments (ie, at baseline and weeks 2, 6, 14, 22, 30, 34, 38, 46, and 
50)
NSAIDs/cyclooxygenase -2 (COX -2) inhibitors: If the subject enters the 
study taking an NSAID/COX -2 inhibitor, the dose of NSAIDs/COX -2 
inhibitors can be reduced or discontinued during the study if necessary for 
safety reasons or standard of care. In cases of flare, the dose of 
NSAIDs/COX -2 inhibitors can be temporarily increased as needed. 
However, the subject must return to the maintenance dose (the dose at 
baseline) as soon as the flare resolves. In subjects not taking an 
NSAID/COX -2 inhibitor, one may be added temporarily to treat a flare in 
RA. It should be tapered and discontinued with resolution of flare. In all 
cases, these agents will not beallowed within 12 hours before clinical 
efficacy assessments (ie, at baseline and weeks 2, 6, 14, 22, 30, 34, 38, 
46, and 50)
topical anesthetic creams (eg, lidocaine/prilocaine creams and licensed 
NSAID creams) are permitted. However, these agents will not be allowed

ConfidentialUpon completion of screening, the investigator (or designee) will contact the IXRS to 
randomize the sub ject centrally to receive either ABP 710 or infliximab in a 1:1 manner. 
The randomization will be stratified based on geographic region and prior biologic use 
(yes versus no) for RA (with prior biologic use capped at 30% of the study population). 
At week 22, subjects initially randomized to the infliximab group will be re -randomized in 
a 1:1 ratio (via IXRS) to either continue receiving infliximab every 8 weeks or switch to 
the ABP 710 group. Re-randomization will be managed to ensure that the blind to t he 
initial study group is maintained.
8.5.10 Unblinding Procedures
A subject’s treatment assignment should only be unblinded when knowledge of the 
treatment is essential for the further management of the subject on this study.
Unblinding at the study center for any other reason will be considered a protocol 
violation.  The investigator is strongly encouraged to contact the Amgen medical monitor
(or designee) before unblinding any subject’s treatment assignment, but must do so 
within 1 working day after the event.
The identity of investigational product assigned to subject numbers or to individual boxes 
of investigational product will be available for emergency situations through the IXRS. 
Authorized study center staff will be provided with a unique Personal Ident ification 
Number (PIN) to access the IXRS to obtain unblinding information. This PIN is unique to 
the individual and must not be shared.

The primary endpo int is the response difference (RD) of 20% improvement in ACR core set 
measurements (ACR20) at week 22.
ACR20
To achieve ACR20 response, at least 20% improvement compared with baseline is
required for both swollen joint count (SJC) and tender joint count (TJC) (66/68 joint
counts; Section 17.3), as well as for 3 out of the following 5 additionalparameters:
Subject's Global Health Assessment (on a 100 -mm visual analogue scale 
[VAS]; Section 17.4)
Investigator's Global Health Assessment (on a 100 -mm VAS; Section 17.4)
subject's assessment of pain (on a 100- mm VAS; Section 17.4)
Health Assessment Questionnaire -Disability Index (HAQ -DI) (Section 17.4)
serum CRP
8.6.1.1.2 Secondary  Efficacy Criteria
The secondary endpoints are:
response difference of ACR20 at weeks 2, 6, 14, 30, 34, 38, 46, and 50
response difference of at least 50% improvement in ACR core set 
measurements (ACR50), and at least 70% improvement in ACR core set 
measurements (ACR70) at weeks 2, 6, 14, 22, 30, 34, 38, 46, and 50

The DAS28-CRP is a composite measure of disease activity in RA.  It is a continuous 
measure based on 28 Disease Activity Score (DAS) joints from th e ACR, the Subject's 
Global Health Assessment score and CRP, as follows:
DAS28-CRP = 0.56*(TJC28)0.5+ 0.28*(SJC28)0.5+ 0.36*ln(CRP+1) + 0.014*GH + 0.96
where TJC28 is the tender joint count of the 28 joints in the D AS, SJC28 is the swollen 
joint count of the 28 joints in the DAS, CRP is in mg/L, and GH  is the Subject's Global 
Health Assessment on a 0 to 100 scale.

9.1.1 Screen Failures
If a subject has not met all eligibility criteria at the end of the screening period, the 
subject will be registered as a screen fail . Laboratory assessments used to determine 
subject eligibility may be rep eated during the screening period before the subject is 
considered a screen failure. Screen failed subjects may be rescreened up to 2times at 
the investigator’s discretion (ie, a total of 3 screens including initial screening). If 
screening procedures c annot be completed with in28 days before day 1, the 
subject will be considered a screen failure but may  be eligible for rescreening.  
These subjects can be rescreened under the same ICFif rescreening occurs 
within 30 days of initial consent date .  The sub ject will retain the same subject 
identification number provided at the initial screening. Subjects must be re -consented if 
more than 30 days have elapsed between date of initial informed consent and date of 
rescreen/randomization.
9.2 Baseline (Day  1, first day of treatment, Week 0)
Day 1 will be defined as the first day of treatment. After subjects are confirmed to meet 
the entry criteria ( Section 8.4 ), the investigator (or designee) will contact the IXRS to 
randomize the subje ct centrally to receive either ABP 710 or infliximab. The following 
assessments/procedures will be performed before treatment:
subjective assessments (Subject's Global Health Assessment,

Confi dential10METHODS OF A SSESSMEN T
10.1 Efficacy Assessments
At each time point for RA assessments, the Subject's Global Health Assessment, 
Investigator’s Global Health Assessment, subject's assessment of pain, and HAQ -DI
(Section 17.4) will be completed. These assessments should be the first assessments 
performed at the visits for which they are scheduled.
At these same time points, joints will be assessed and classified as swollen/not swollen
and tender/n ot tender by pressure and joint manipulation on physical examination.   
Joint prosthesis, arthrodesis, orfused joints willnotbeassessed forswelling or
tenderness.
The joints to be assessed for swelling and tenderness are given in Section 17.3, 
including the 66/68 joint set for ACR and the 28 joint count for DAS. All joint 
assessments will be performed by an experienced joint evaluator. The evaluator cannot 
be the treating physician and cannot interact with the subject on the study beyond the 
assessment of joints. The evaluator should not discuss the subject’s clinical status nor 
should the evaluator have access to subject medical records or eCRFs, including prior 
joint assessments.  The same evaluator shou ld perform joint assessments across all 
time points for a subject where possible.
For the screening and baseline joint counts, the distal interphalanges should be
evaluated, butshould notbeincluded inthetotal joint count todetermine eligibility.
The Investigator's Global Health Assessment will also be completed at the times
indicated in Table 8-1 .  The independent joint assessor may not complete the
Investigator’s Global Disease Assessment.  The physician com pleting the
Investigator’s Global Disease Assessment will have access to the joint assessments.  
The subject andphysician must complete the global assessments independently from 
each other.
10.2 Safety Assessments
10.2.1 Pregnancy Test
Pregnancy will be determined by evaluation of beta- human chorionic gonadotrophin in
serum at screening by the central laboratory and in urine at subsequent time points
locally for all women of childbearing potential.  Subjects who are pregnant will be
excluded from the study.

Confi dentialThe invest igator will inform the sponsor immediately of any case of pregnancy and
collect information onanyfemale subject whobecomes pregnant while participating in 
this study and in case of pregnancy among female partners of male subjects.   The
subject will also be followed to determine the outcome of the pregnancy.
10.2.2 Physical Examination
Physical examinations will be performed by a physician and will include examination of
the following: general appearance, head, ears, eyes, nose, throat, neck, skin,
cardiovascula r system, respiratory system, abdominal system, and nervous system.   
Foreach body system, an assessment of normal or abnormal will be recorded.   
Clinically relevant changes from baseline will be reported as adverse events.
Body weight (kg) will be measured without shoes or jacket at screening, baseline, and
before infusion at each dosing visit, and dose of investigational product will be adjusted
for weight changes, if required.  Height will be determined at screening.
10.2.3 Vital Signs
Systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure will be measured on the same
arm(preferentially on theleftarm) after thesubject has been inasupine/sitting position
for 5minutes.  Pulse will be recorded simultaneously with blood pressure
measurements.   Respiration rate and temperature will also be recorded.  Vital signs 
will be measured atscreening, before and after infusion at each dosing visit, and at the 
end-of-study visit.
During the study, measurement of vital signs may be repeated at the discretion of the
investig ator for safety reasons.  Clinically relevant abnormal findings will be reported
asadverse events.
10.2.4 Electrocardiogram
Computerized 12- lead ECG recordings will be obtained after the subject has been
supine for 5 minutes.  Each lead will be recorded for at least 3 to 5 beats at a speed of
25 mm/sec paper speed and 10 mm/mV amplitude.  At a minimum, heart rate,
P-wave, PR -interval, QRS -wave, QT -interval, and corrected QT -intervals (msec) will 
berecorded from the 12 -lead ECG.  A copy of the ECGs will be retain ed at the study 
center.  For thepurposes of screening, the investigator or a designee will evaluate 
whether the ECG isnormal orabnormal andwhether it isclinically acceptable for
inclusion, ifabnormal.

based onthe sponsor’s tubercu losis risk assessment worksheet and the other criteria 
listed inthe Inclusion Criteria, Section 8.4.1.
10.2.6 Chest Radiography
Chest radiography will be performed at screening as indicated in Table 8-1 andwill
include anterior/posterior or posterior/anterior and lateral views.  Chest X -ray
performed at the study center can be read by the investigator.  A formal report, signed 
off by theinvestigator, will be fi led in the subject’s medical records.  If the X -ray is 
performed offsite, then formal reports signed off by a radiologist should be acceptable.  
Historical films obtained or formal reports signed off by a radiologist within the 3 
months prior toreceiving investigational product are acceptable for screening as well.
10.3 Clinical Laboratory Testing
Venous blood samples willbetaken forclinical laboratory tests atthetime points
indicated in Table 8-1 .  The following parameters will be determined:
Serology :  HBsAg, hepatitis B core antibody, and HCV antibody.
Hematology :  Hemoglobin, hematocrit or packed cell volume, red blood cell count, 
mean corpuscular hemoglobin, mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, white
blood cell count, differential white cell count, platelet count.
Clinical chemistry : Sodium, potassium, urea, creatinine, total protein, albumin, total
bilirubin, AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase, gamma glutamyl transferase, and nonfasting
glucose.  Rheumatoid factor and anti -CCP will be assessed at screening.   C-reactive
protein will be assessed at the time points indicated in Table 8-1 .  C-reactive protein
results from the baseline visit and onwards will be blinded a nd not included in the
central laboratory reports to the study center.  Subjects with any abnormal liver 
function tests should be followed for potential hepatotoxicity.  The investigational 
product should bestopped in cases of jaundice and/or marked liver enzyme elevations.

11.1 Adverse Events
11.1.1 Definition of A dverse Events
An adverse event is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical trial
subject.  The event does not necessarily have a causal relationship with
investigational product.  The investigator is responsible for ensuring that any adverse 
events observed by the investigator or reported by the subject are recorded in the 
subject’s medical record as well as in the eCRF.
The definition of adverse events includes worsening of a pre -existing medical
conditi on.  Worsening indicates that the pre -existing medical condition (eg, diabetes,
migraine headaches, andgout) hasincreased inseverity, frequency, and/or duration,
and/or hasan association with a significantly worse outcome.  In the case of 
worsening of a pre- existing condition, the start date of the event is the date when the 
first signs ofworsening were observed.  A pre -existing condition that has not worsened 
during thestudy or involves an intervention such as elective cosmetic surgery or a
medical procedure while on study is not considered an adverse event.
11.1.2 Reporting Procedures for A dverse Events
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all adverse events observed by the
investigator orreported bythesubject thatoccur from thedayofrandomization until
the week 50 visit (or through 28 days after the last dose of investigational product for
subjects who discontinue study early) are reported using the applicable eCRF Adverse
Event Summary page.  Adverse events observed by the investigator o r reported by the
subject, that occur after signing of informed consent but before randomization would be
recorded.
The investigator must assign the following adverse eventattributes:
adverse event diagnosis or syndrome(s), if known (if not known, signs or
symptoms)
dates of onset and resolution
severity
assessment of relatedness to investigational product
action taken
Product :ABP710
Clinical StudyProtocol: 20140111 
Date:   17March 2017 Page 57of 82
Confi dentialAdverse events must be graded for severity according to the National Cancer Institute 
(US) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events ( CTCAE) version 4.03 
(http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm).
The investigator must assess whether the adverse event is possibly related to the 
investigational product. This relationship is indicated by a “yes” or “no” response to the 
question: “Is there a reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by the 
investigational product?”
The investigator is responsible fo r reviewing laboratory test results and determining 
whether an abnormal value in an individual study subject represents a clinically 
significant change from the subject’s baseline values. In general, abnormal laboratory 
findings without clinical significance (based on the investigator's judgment) are not to be 
recorded as adverse events. However, laboratory value changes that require treatment 
or adjustment in current therapy are considered adverse events. Where applicable, 
clinical sequelae (not the laboratory abnormality) are to be recorded as the adverse 
event.
The investigator’s clinical judgment is used to determine whether a subject is to be
removed from treatment due to an adverse event.  A subject, or subject’s legal
guardian, can also voluntarily withdraw from treatment due to an adverse event.  If the
subject withdraws consent, the subject is encouraged to undergo, at a minimum, an
end-of-study assessment.
11.2 Serious A dverse Events
11.2.1 Definition of Serious A dverse Events
A serious adverse event is def ined as an adverse event that meets at least 1 of the
following serious criteria:
fatal
life-threatening (places the subject at immediate risk of death)
requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization
results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity
congenital anomaly/birth defect
other medically important serious event
Product :ABP710
Clinical StudyProtocol: 20140111 
Date:   17March 2017 Page 58of 82
Confi dentialAn adverse event would meet the criterion of “requires hospitalization”, if the event 
necessitated an admission to a health care facility (eg, overni ght stay).
Ifan investigator considers anevent tobe clinically important, butitdoes notmeet any 
of the serious criteria, theevent could beclassified asaserious adverse event under
thecriterion of “other medically important serious event.” Exampl es of such events
could include allergic bronchospasm, convulsions, blood dyscrasias, drug -induced liver
injury, or events that necessitate an emergency room visit, outpatient surgery, or
urgent intervention.
11.2.2 Reporting Procedures for Serious A dverse Events
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all serious adverse events observed by 
the investigator or reported by the subject that occur after signing of the ICF through 
28days after the last dose of investigational product are recorded in the sub ject’s 
medical record and are submitted to Amgen.
The serious adverse event must be submitted to Amgen, or its designee, within 24 hours 
following the investigator’s knowledge of the event via the applicable eCRF or via paper 
serious adverse event report f orm if it occurs prior to randomization, ie, during screening.
If the electronic data capture (EDC) system is not functional, the serious adverse event 
can be reported by faxing a completed paper Serious Adverse Event Fax Cover Sheet 
and serious adverse ev ent report form or by direct telephone communication with PRA 
Safety Risk Management at the numbers provided below. The event must be updated 
electronically in the EDC system by the clinical study center once the EDC function 
resumes.

information.   Theinvestigator may beasked toprovide additional follow -upinformation,
whichmay include adischarge summary orextracts from themedical record.  Information
provided about theserious adverse event must beconsistent withthatrecorded onthe
applicable eCRF (eg,Adverse Event Summary eCRF).
Elective hospitalizations are not considered serious adverse events.  If a subject is
permanently withdrawn from protocol -required therapies because ofaserious adverse
event, thisinformation must besubmitted toAmgen, oritsdesignee. 
Tocomply withworldwide reporting regulations forserious adverse events, thetreatment
assignment ofsubjects who develop serious, unexpected, andrelated adverse events
may beunblinded byAmgen, oritsdesignee, before submission toregulatory

sent toregulatory authorities inaccordance withlocal requirements.
Determination ofexpectedness forAmgen products willbebased ontheIBforthe
investigational product andtheregional prescribing information forproducts being
studied for an approved use.  Expectedness assessments are to be made for all
investigational products (Amgen and non- Amgen) using theappropriate reference safety
information per local regulatory reporti ng requirements.  Suspected unexpected serious
adverse reactions (SUSARs) reported forsubjects receiving anon-Amgen

11.3 Adverse Events of Special Interest
Adverse events of special interest for ABP 710/infliximab are defined in the IB and 
analyzed from the clinical database using search strategies.  There are no expedited 
reporting requirements foradverse events ofspecial interest (other than those that
meet other reporting requir ements).
11.4 Pregnancy Reporting
Pregnancy in itself is not regarded as an adverse event unless there is a suspicion
thataninvestigational product may have interfered withtheeffectiveness ofa
contraceptive medication.  However, the outcome of all pregnanc ies (spontaneous
miscarriage, elective termination, normal birth, or congenital abnormality) must be 
followed up anddocumented even if the subject was discontinued from the study.
All reports of congenital abnormalities/birth defects are serious adverse events.  
Spontaneous miscarriages should also be reported and handled as serious adverse
events.  Elective abortions without complications should not be handled as adverse
events.  All outcomes of pregnancy must be reported to Amgen, or its designee.
Pregna ncy surveillance will include a pregnancy questionnaire that also addresses
lactation surveillance.  Any pregnancy that is ongoing or reported after completion of
thestudy will be followed up by the sponsor.

The data management and statistical analysis of this study will be performed by an 
external clinical research organization (CRO), PRA.
12.1 Data Management
Previous and concomitant medications will be coded using the latest available World
Health Organization- Drug Dictionary (W HO-DD).  Coexistent diseases and adverse
events will be coded using Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA).
When the database has been declared to be complete and accurate, it will be locked.
12.2 Sample Size Estimation
Approximately 550 subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either ABP 710 
or infliximab. Subjects will be stratified based on geographic region and prior biologi c 
use for RA (with prior biologic use capped at 30% of the study population). The sample 
size is chosen to achieve > 90% power to demonstrate equivalence at a 0.05 
significance level on the primary efficacy endpoint, RD of ACR20 at week 22 between 
ABP 710 and infliximab, with an equivalence margin of ( -15%, 15%), assuming an 
expected ACR20 rate for both ABP 710 and infliximab of 52% at week 22. The sample 
size will also achieve approximately 85% power to demonstrate equivalence on the RD 
of ACR20 between ABP 710 and infliximab with an equivalence margin of ( -12%, 15%) 
at a significance level of 0.05 at week 22.

12.4 Randomization
Randomization will be performed by an IXRS . The randomization schedule will be 
prepared by a statistician not involved in the conduct of the study. Upon completion of 
screening, approximately 550 eligible subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to 
receive either ABP 710 3 mg/kg infusion on da y 1, at weeks 2 and 6, and every 8 weeks 
thereafter (treatment group A), or infliximab 3 mg/kg infusion on day 1, at weeks 2 and 6,

be re -randomized in a 1:1 ratio (via IXRS) to either continue receiv ing infliximab every
8 weeks (treatment group B1) or switch to the ABP 710 group (treatment group B2).  
Subjects initially randomized to ABP 710 (treatment group A) will continue on the same
treatment.  Re -randomization will be managed to ensure that the blind to the initial
study group is maintained.   Subjects unable to complete the week 22 visit within 
the allo wed visit window will not be re -randomized and will be discontinued from 
the study .
12.5 Analysis Sets
The primary analysis for the efficacy endpoints w ill be performed using the intention-
to-treat analysis set.  The per -protocol analysis set will be used for sensitivity 
analyses ofthe efficacy endpoints.  The analysis of safety endpoints will be based on 
thesafety analysis set.  Information about the analysis of pharmacokinetic
concentration summaries will be provided in the SAP.
12.5.1 Intention- to-treat AnalysisSet
The intention -to-treat analysis set includes all subjects randomized in the
study.  Analyses will be based on randomized treatment (regardless of actual
treatment received).
12.5.2 Per-protocol A nalysisSet
The per -protocol analysis set includes all subjects randomized in the study who have 
completed the specified treatment period and did not experience a protocol deviation 
that affected their evaluation for the primary objective of the study. Analyses will be 
based on actual treatment received. Per-protocol analysis sets will be determined 
separately for the primary analysis conducted at week 34, and for the additional analysis 
conducted at the end of the study. The protocol deviations that affect evaluation of the 
primary objective will be determined based on a blinded data review prior to database

Confi dential12.6 Statistical Methods
The primary analysis will be conducted at week 34, when all subjects have either 
completed the week 34 visit or been terminated before the week 34 vis it. The end of the 
study will be at week 50, and a final analysis will be conducted when all subjects have 
completed the week 50/end -of-study assessments or been terminated early from the 
study.
For binary endpoints (eg, ACR 20/50/70), the difference in p ercentages and their CIs will 
be estimated using Mantel -Haenszel estimate of common RDs and stratified Newcombe 
confidence limits for the common RDs to adjust for the stratification factors. For 
continuous endpoints (eg, DAS28 -CRP), the CI of the mean dif ference will be estimated 
using analysis of covariance model with relevant baseline values and stratification 
factors as covariates.
All categorical variables will be summarized using the number and percentage of 
subjects falling into each category and all continuous variables will be summarized using 
mean, standard error or standard deviation, median, minimum, maximum, and number
of subjects with observations. Safety endpoints will be summarized descriptively. 
Subgroup analyses (by age, race, sex, and st ratification factors) will be presented if 
deemed necessary.

All efficacy analy seswill be performed using the intention- to-treat analysis set based
onthe subject’s randomized treatment.  As a sensitivity analysis, the equivalence test
onthe primary endpoint will also beperformed using the per -protocol analysis set.
Clinical equivalence for the primary endpoint, RD of ACR20 at week 22, will be
sequentially evaluated: first by comparing the 2 -sided 90% CI of the RD of ACR20
between ABP 710 and infliximab with the equivalence margin of ( -15%, 15%).  The
CIs will beestimated from thestratified Newcombe confidence limits forthecommon
RDtoadjust for stratification factors.  If the first equivalence is established, the
primary endpoint, RD of ACR20 at week 22 ,will be further evaluated by comparing 
thesame 2 -sided 90% CI between ABP 710 and infliximab with an equivalence 
margin of(-12%, 15%).  In addition to the 90% CI, the 95% CI for all primary  and 
secondary  efficacy  endpoints will also be provided descriptively .
Inferential analyses will only be performed for the primary endpoint.  Secondary
efficacy endpoints, ACR20 at sched

Amgen has ethical, legal, and scientific obligations to conduct this study in accordance 
with established research principles and ICH GCP guidelines. As such, to fulfill these 
obligations and to maintain current of study progress, Amgen monitors, or Amgen’s 
designees, will visit the study centers during study conduct, in addition to maintaining 
telephone and written communication. On-site visits, telephone calls, and regular 
inspection of the eCR Fs will be conducted to assess subject enrollment, compliance with 
protocol procedures, completeness and accuracy of data entered on the eCRFs, 
verification of eCRF data against original source documents, and occurrence of adverse 
events.  The investigator must provide the monitor with full access to all source and 
study documents.
13.1 Routine Monitoring
Amgen, or its designee, assigned monitors will conduct regular study center visits to the 
investigational facilities for the purpose of monitoring various aspe cts of the study. The 
investigator must agree to Amgen, or its designee, authorized personnel having direct 
access to the clinical (or associated) files and clinical study supplies (dispensing and 
storage areas) for all study subjects considered for study entry for the purpose of 
verifying entries made in the eCRF, and assist with their activities, if requested.
Adequate time and space for monitoring visits should be made available by the 
investigator.
The study center must complete the eCRFs in a timely m anner and on an ongoing basis 
to allow regular review by the study monitor.
Whenever a subject name is revealed on a document that is to be collected for the

an agreement will be obtained in writing.
The investigator must ensure that each subject’s anonymity is maintained. On eCRFs 
and other documents submitted to the sponsor o r the CRO, subjects must not be 
identified by name. Instead, subjects will only be known by the unique subject number 
allocated to them to ensure confidentiality on all study documentation. Subjects will 
retain this unique number throughout the study. The investigator will keep a separate 
log of these codes.
To comply with government regulatory guidelines and to ensure subject safety, it may be 
necessary for the sponsor and its representative, the CRO personnel, the local research 
review board, or the US FDA to review subjects’ medical records as they relate to this 
study. Only the subject’s unique number on the eCRFs will identify him/her, but their full 
names may be made known to a drug regulatory authority or other authorized 
government or health care officials, if necessary, and to personnel designated by the 
sponsor.
Documents that are not for submission to the sponsor or the CRO (eg, consent forms) 
will be maintained by the investigator in strict confidence, except to the extent necessary 
to allow m onitoring by the sponsor and the CRO, and auditing by regulatory authorities. 
No documents identifying subjects by name will leave the study center and subject 
identity will remain confidential in all publications related to the study.

Confi dential15ADMINISTRATION PROC EDURES
15.1 Regulatory Approval
Amgen, or their appointed agents, will be responsible for ensuring that appropriate 
regulatory authority approvals are obtained, according to local country requirements.
No subject may enter the study until this approval has been obtained. A copy of the 
approval (where one is provided as requested, according to local country requirements) 
will be provided to the investigator and to the IRB(s)/IEC(s).
15.2 Protocol A mendments
In accordance with ICH Topic E 6 (R1) Guideline for GCP, the investigator should not 
implement any deviation from or changes to the protocol without agreement by the 
sponsor and documented approval from the IRB/IEC of a protocol amendment except 
where necessary to eliminate an immediate hazard(s) to study subjects or when the 
change(s) involves only logistical or administrative aspects of the study (eg, change in 
monitor[s], change of telephone number[s]).
Any change to the protocol must be handled as a protocol amendment. Any potential 
amendment must be approved by the sponsor. A written amendment must be submitted 
to the appropriate regulatory authorities and to the IRB/ IECassuming this responsibility. 
The investigator must await IRB/IEC approval of protocol amendments before 
implementing the changes, except where necessary to eliminate apparent immediate 
hazard to subjects. In these cases, the IRB/IEC must be notified within 5 days of the 
change.
All amendments to the protocol must be approved in writing by both the appropriate 
regulatory authorities and the I RB/IEC, except for administrative amendments, which 
require notification but not written approval. Once approved, the protocol amendment 
will be distributed to all recipients of the original protocol, with instructions to append the 
amendment to the protocol.
If, in the judgment of the local IRB/IEC, the investigator and/or sponsor, the protocol 
amendment alters the study design or procedures and/or increases the potential risk to 
the subject, the currently approved written ICF will require modification. The modified 
ICF must also be reviewed and approved by the sponsor, appropriate regulatory 
authorities, and the IRB/IEC. In such cases, repeat informed consent must be obtained 
from subjects enrolled in the study before participation continues.

Confi dential15.3 Protocol A dherence and Deviations
The protocol must be read thoroughly and the instructions must be followed.   
However, exceptions willbemade inemergency situations when theprotection,
safety,and well -being ofthesubject requires immediate intervention based onthe
judgment oftheinvestigator or (a) responsible, appropriately trained, and credentialed
professional(s) designated by the investigator as a sub-investigator.
Intheevent ofasignificant protocol deviation duetoanemergency, accident, or
error, the investigator or designee must contact the medical monitor at the earliest
possible time by telephone.  This allows for an early joint decision to be made as to 
whether ornot the subject should continue in the study.  The investigator, sponsor, 
andmedi calmonitor will document this decision.
15.4 Publication Policy
Authorship ofany publications resulting from thisstudy willbedetermined onthebasis
of the Uniform Requirement for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals
(International Committee of Med ical Journal Editors), which states:
Authorship credit is to be based on (1) substantial contributions to 
conception and design, acquisition of data, or analysis and interpretation of 
data; (2) drafting the article or revising it critically for important i ntellectual 
content; (3) final approval of the version to be published; (4) agreement to 
be accountable for all aspects of the work in ensuring that questions related 
to the accuracy or integrity of any part of the work are appropriately 
investigated and r esolved. Authors are to meet conditions 1, 2, 3, and 4.
When a large, multicenter group has conducted the work, the group is to 
identify the individuals who accept direct responsibility for the manuscript. 
These individuals are to fully meet the criteria for authorship defined above.
Acquisition of funding, collection of data, or general supervision of the 
research group, alone, does not justify authorship.
All persons designated as authors a re to qualify for authorship, and all 
those who qualify are to b e listed.
Each author is to have participated sufficiently in the work to take public 
responsibility for appropriate portions of the content.
All publications (eg, manuscripts, abstracts, oral/slide presentations, book chapters)

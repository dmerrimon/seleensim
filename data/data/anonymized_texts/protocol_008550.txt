3 Version  Date 02.04.20191.0 Objectives
The goals of  this study are to evaluate the efficacy of JNJ-18038683 in an 
8 week trial to ameliorate the cognitive deficit and reduce residual 
depressive symptoms in 60 stable bipolar outpatients receiving treatment 
for depression.  JNJ-18038683 will be studied and compared with placebo 
as adjunctive treatment to standard pharmacologic treatment for bipolar 
disorder.  
2.0 Background
2.1.1 Cognitive  impairment in bipolar disorder 
Most, but  not all, patients with bipolar disorder (BPD) have clinically significant 
cognitive impairment [1, 2]. Impairment is present in both the manic and depressed 
phases of BPD, as well as in euthymic periods  [3]. The percentage of BPD patients 
with cognitive impairment (CIBD) varies among studies, with 40-60% representing 
the best estimate [3]. The weight of the evidence supports no overall difference in 
the type and severity of cognitive impairment in any phase of BPD, i.e. it is a stable 
trait feature of BPD, albeit variable from one patient to another. The most 
commonly affected cognitive domains are speed of processing, declarative 
memory, attention and working memory [3, 4]. Although CIBD is milder in severity 
than the cognitive impairment associated with  schizophrenia (CIAS), on average, 
as in schizophrenia, CIBD has a major impact on function and quality of life in most 
patients, particularly because the greater preservation of function  of BPD enables 
them to engage in activities which are more dependent on intact  cognitive function 
[5]. Thus, it is highly likely that improvement in CIBD will have valuable clinical 
benefit, especially with regard to quality of life measures. It is reasonable to predict 
that treatments effective to improve CIBD could also be beneficial for CIAS. 
Efficacy for cognitive impairment is likely to be greater in BPD than schizophrenia, 
because the baseline severity is milder in the former [6] . Despite this strong 
rationale for targeting CIBD, there has been minimal focus on clinical trials to 
improve CIBD, perhaps because so many resources have been devoted to the 
effort to treat CIAS, but lack of appreciation of the severity of CIBD and its 
importance as a determinant of functional outcome in BPD may be the most 
important factors.  
In a recent  study of CIBD, using the MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery 
(MCCB), impairment was found in both treatment resistant BP I and II depressed 
inpatients within all MCCB domains [4]. The greatest impairment was evident in 
speed of processing, declarative memory and attention.  The impairment was 
numerically greater in BP I than BP II patients but the difference was not significant.  
Compared to normal controls, the deficits, in BP 1 patients, in speed of processing 
was 1.2SD, in attention, 1.0 SD, and in verbal learning, 1.8 SD.   The least affected 
domain was visual learning, with a mean deficit of 0.8SD compared to normal 
controls.   The mean composite score deficit was 1.25 SD. Medication for BPD, 
particularly mood stabilizers, may adversely affect some domains of cognition in

severity of cognitive impairment in major depression or BPD [8].
2.1.2 Preclinical  Rationale for Studying JNJ-18038683 to treat CIBD and CIAS 
Serotonin (5-HT) 7 receptors  are one of 14 5-HT receptors. This Gs-protein coupled 
receptor is widely distributed in brain, with high density in the thalamus, 
hypothalamus, hippocampus, suprachiasmatic nucleus, amygdala and septum, 
with lower levels in the cerebral cortex. The HTR7, is positively coupled to 
adenylate cyclase (as are the dopamine (DA) D 1, 5-HT 4 and 5-HT 6 receptors), and 
has aroused considerable interest as a target for drugs to treat depression, as well 
as some for cognitive impairment and psychosis [9-11]. For example, there has 
been considerable interest in 5-HT 7 antagonists as stand-alone antidepressants 
[10, 12, 13] or as contributor to multireceptor antidepressant drugs [14-16]. JNJ 
18038683 and other selective 5-HT 7 receptor antagonists have been reported to 
be effective antidepressants in a variety of animal models, including tail suspension 
[13]. JNJ-18038683 potentiated the ability of a sub-effective dose of the SSRI 
citalopram to increase extracellular levels of 5-HT in rat cortex. JNJ-18038683 had 
no effect by itself on 5-HT efflux in a microdialysis study.  In a failed clinical trial, 
JNJ-18038683 did not differentiate from placebo, but the active comparator also 
did not differentiate, possibly because of a high placebo response rate. Importantly, 
no safety concerns emerged for the compound [13]. 
Of key  relevance to this proposal, 5-HT 7 receptor selective drugs  have  been 
shown to be active in animal models of psychosis, learning, and memory [10]. 5-
HT7 receptor blockade has been postulated to be a  key component of the cognitive 
enhancement due to atypical APDs, e.g. amisulpride, clozapine, lurasidone, and 
risperidone, which are potent 5-HT 7 antagonists [17-19] and as a stand-alone 
cognitive enhancer [20]. We will report key additional evidence in the Preliminary 
Studies section. With regard to animal models of antipsychotic activity, the 
selective 5-HT 7 antagonist, SB-258471, prevented the disruption of prepulse 
inhibition (PPI) in phencyclidine (PCP)-but not amphetamine-treated rats, 
indicating positive influence on the glutamate, but not DA, component of PPI, a 
model of the sensory gating deficit in BPD and schizophrenia which has bearing 
upon antipsychotic activity and attention, a key component of CIBD [9]. However, 
the selective, 5-HT 7 antagonist SB269970 [21] was able to reverse the effect of 
amphetamine to disrupt PPI in C57BL/6 mice [9]. It has been reported that SB-
269970 significantly reversed the NMDA receptor antagonist dizocilpline (MK-
801)-induced deficits in the delayed non-matching to position task, a measure of 
working memory, but augmented the deficit induced by low dose scopolamine, a 
muscarinic antagonist [22]. These authors also showed that SB-269970 
normalized MK-801-induced glutamate but not DA efflux in the prefrontal cortex.  
SB269970 improved reference memory in a radial arm maze [9, 12] and a PCP-
induced reversal learning deficit in rats [23]. SB-656104-A, another 5-HT 7

5 Version  Date 02.04.2019antagonist, improved learning  and memory deficits induced by an NMDAR 
antagonist, in the rat passive avoidance test alone and with a subeffective dose of 
lurasidone [24]. Sarkisyan and Hedlund [25] reported a deficit in spatial memory in 
a novel location test in 5-HT 7 knock out mice and mice treated with SB-269970. 
However, we have found no deficit in novel location in HTR7 knock out mice.  In a 
recent publication, Andressen et al There is some conflicting evidence about the 
role of 5-HT 7 antagonism in cognition. 5-HT 7 agonism has been suggested to be 
an effective target for improvement of cognitive impairment in aging mice and in 
an Alzheimer’s mouse model, as the 5-HT 7 agonist AS19 enhanced memory 
formation in an autoshaping task, an effect blocked by SB269970 [26]. Gasbarri et 
al [27] suggested that the role of the 5-HT 7 receptor in cognition will vary depending 
upon the task and brain regions involved.  Eriksson et al [28] suggested that 5-HT 7 
receptor blockade can intensify impairments in emotional memory that are induced 
by 5-HT 1A receptor stimulation. 
2.1.3 Preclinical  Evidence:
The predominant  strategy to develop pharmacologic treatments for CIAS and by 
extension, CIBD, relies upon ameliorating cognitive impairment induced in rodent 
models which have some relation to the psychotic spectrum disorders, especially 
drug- or transgenic-induced abnormalities in cognition. Evidence from animal 
models suggests that serotonin (5-HT) 7 receptor(R) antagonism is a promising 
target to treat CIBD and CIAS. We have extensively studied SB-269970, the 
protypical 5-HT 7 selective antagonist, in the sub-chronic (sc) phencyclidine (PCP) 
rat and mouse models of CIAS.  PCP, an NMDAR antagonist, is widely studied for 
this purpose because of the extensive evidence that abnormalities in glutamate 
and GABA neurotransmission in cortex and hippocampus may be the prime cause 
of CIAS. Acute or scPCP produces a wide range of documented deficits in NMDAR 
and GABA neurotransmission. We recently reported that SB269970 (0.1-1 mg/kg) 
dose-dependently reversed scPCP-induced novel object recognition (NOR) 
deficits in rats [17]. NOR is a model of human declarative memory. We have 
replicated these results in mice treated with PCP or ketamine for 7 days and 
washed out 7 days or longer (Figure 1).  SB-269970 can also reverse PCP-induced 
deficits in novel location detection. Our data contrasts with results from the 
Hedlund lab.  In addition, we reported that the ability of two atypical antipsychotic 
drugs (APDs), lurasidone (0.1 mg/kg) and amisulpride (3 mg/kg), to reverse the 
NOR deficit was blocked by co-treatment with the 5-HT 7 receptor agonist, AS19, 
(5-10 mg/kg). None of these compounds affect NOR in naive rats.   There is also 
extensive evidence supporting the cognitive benefits from 5-HT 7 receptor blockade 
from other labs, e.g. restoration of reversal learning in PCP-treated rats.  
Furthermore, we have been breeding 5-HT 7 knock out mice for a year and now 
have many studies with these mice which replicate the results with SB-269970, 
including prevention of the NOR deficit produced by acute or sub-chronic PCP 
(Figure 2).   In addition, the 5-HT 7 knockout mice, from adolescence to adulthood,

7 Version  Date 02.04.2019Additional Evidence  for Pro-cognitive effects of JNJ-18038683 on Executive 
Function:
Reversal learning:  See Abdul-Monim et al., and Brigman et al., [29, 30] for 
detailed methodology . Apart from the declarative memory deficits, there is a range 
of cognitive deficits in  BPD and schizophrenia, including impaired executive 
functioning [31], which can be assessed by operant reversal learning tasks in 
rodents [32]. We found that both JNJ-18038683 and SB269970 (4 mg/kg) were 
able to reverse sub-chronic PCP induced decrease in percentage correct 
responding in the reversal phase of the task (Figure 4). 
2.2 Rationale  for Randomized Controlled Trial of JNJ-18038683 on Cognition and 
Residual Depressive Symptoms in Bipolar Disorder
Based on  the pre-clinical, pro-cognitive effects of 5-HT 7 antagonism in our 
laboratory, along with the reported pre-clinical antidepressant effects of JNJ-
18038683, we propose to conduct a randomized, placebo- controlled parallel, 
design study to assess the effects of JNJ-18038683 on multiple domains of 
cognition and mood symptoms.  Since our preclinical studies show that 5-HT 7 
receptor blockade is highly effective in improving declarative memory in rodents, 
the declarative memory measures will be the primary outcome measures.  As 
previously discussed Andressen et. al [39] noted differential functional selectivity 
of the 5-HT 7 receptor, suggesting that the effects of atypical APDs with known 5-
HT7 antagonism, such as lurasidone, ziprasidone and risperidone, are modulated 
via different HTR 7 subunits than JNJ1083868. In light of this new information, we 
proposed to allow some individuals currently prescribed treatment with atypical 
APDs with 5-HT 7 antagonism to be eligible for screening and randomization.  1 2 3 4 5 6 1 2 3 4 5 6050100150

IRB #: STU00200919 Approved by NU IRB for use on or after 3/8/2021 through 3/7/2022.
12 Version  Date 02.04.2019Study visits  will include screening and 6 visits (baseline, Weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8). 
Please see Appendix 1 – Schedule of Assessments
At screening,  the Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnosis for DSM Disorders 
(SCID) will be completed for confirmation of psychiatric diagnosis. A 
medical/psychiatric history will also be collected and a physical exam will be 
performed. Vital signs including weight, height, waist and hip measurement will be 
obtained at screening to record body mass index. The Hopkins Verbal Learning 
Test (HVLT) and Trail Making Test A (TMT-A), will be administered to screen for 
severity of cognitive impairment.  Only individuals who score between the 25th and 
75th percentile as compared to normative data on these tasks will be enrolled.  
If the  subject is determined eligible during the screening procedure, which can last 
for up to two weeks, a baseline visit will be scheduled. Baseline assessments of 
cognitive function, psychopathology and global function will be administered along 
with movement ratings at the baseline visit.  Functional outcome will be assessed 
with Specific Level of Function Scale (SLOF) [33]. Adverse events will be collected 
and recorded from the time the subject signs the informed consent to the final 
safety follow-up visit, and motor side effects will be monitored by the Abnormal 
Involuntary Movement Scale at the following visits: baseline, Weeks 4 and 8.
Individuals will  be randomized to receive JNJ-18038683 or placebo after the 
completion of the baseline assessments. Individuals will be stratified for 
randomization as either being treated with an AD or not being treated with an AD.  
As in the previous study of JNJ-18038683 for depression, individuals randomized 
to JNJ-18038683 will receive 10 mg for one week, then titrate to 20 mg, with the 
provision for a single, downward dose adjustment for intolerance, based upon 
investigator judgment. No antipsychotic drugs which are 5-HT 7 antagonists will be 
permitted to avoid effects upon 5-HT 7 receptors from enhanced 5-HT 
concentrations and possible down regulation of 5-HT 7 receptors. As JNJ-
18038683 is a competitive inhibitor of CYP2D6, there will be a 2 week washout 
period requested after the trial prior to initiation of any CYP2D6 substrates (see 
Appendix 2).
Individuals will  be asked to return to the clinic at study weeks 1, 2, 4, and 6 after 
baseline to monitor for side effects and compliance. At the Week 4 visit, efficacy 
assessments will be completed (MADRS, YMRS and CGI-BP). Between clinic 
visits, research staff will complete phone calls with individuals at study Weeks 3, 
5, and 7. Individuals will return for a final study visit 8 weeks after initiation of the 
randomized study medication. A Safety Follow-up phone call will take place 4 
weeks after the final visit and safety assessments will be completed (C-SSRS, 
Adverse Events, Concomitant Medications). The assessments completed at 
baseline will be repeated at this Week 8 visit (See Appendix 1 – Schedule of 
Assessments). Reasons for early termination will be recorded. Every effort will be 
made to obtain appropriate rating scale data at the final visit of early terminators.

9.2 Randomization  Method:
Those who  meet the study inclusion criteria will be randomized into one of two 
treatment groups, one to receive adjunctive therapy of JNJ-18038683 and the 
other to receive placebo.  Individuals will be stratified for randomization as either 
being treated with an AD or not being treated with an AD. Using SAS software, a 
computer-generated randomization sequences for each treatment arm will be 
assigned using permuted block method limiting imbalance in numbers between 
groups. To assign the randomization, the SAS procedure PROC PLAN will be 
used [34]. Until the trial is concluded, the randomization sequence will be blind to 
the study participants as well as the Principal Investigator, research coordinators 
and raters. Randomization list will be provided by assigned statistician, Karu 
Jayathilake, and will be held by unblinded study drug manager at 680 N.

Health South Bend site. 
9.3 Adverse  Events
In a 7  week, randomized, placebo controlled trial comparing JNJ-18038683 with 
placebo and escitalopram (an active comparator), a total of 6 serious adverse 
events were reported during the study (placebo group: spontaneous abortion and 
suicidal ideation; escitalopram group: spontaneous abortion, suicidal ideation, 
suicide attempt, and chest discomfort). A total of 10 individuals (3 in the placebo 
group, 4 in the JNJ-18038683 group, and 3 in the escitalopram group) were 
withdrawn from the study prematurely due to adverse events. The 4 events 
leading to drop out of individuals on JNJ-18038683 were one instance each of 
the following: bundle branch block, panic attack, upper respiratory infection, and 
insomnia.  
Only 3  individuals receiving the 20-mg dose of JNJ 18038683 required dose 
reductions at any point during the study.
IRB #: STU00200919 Approved by NU IRB for use on or after 3/8/2021 through 3/7/2022.
14 Version  Date 02.04.2019Adverse events  that were reported in more than 5% of individuals in any 
treatment group included headache, nausea, nasopharyngitis, insomnia, 
somnolence, dyspepsia, dizziness, dry mouth, constipation, diarrhea, vomiting, 
back pain, upper respiratory tract infection, palpitations, and fatigue. The 
treatment-emergent adverse events that were reported more frequently in the 
JNJ 18038683 group compared with the placebo or escitalopram groups included 
dyspepsia, constipation, upper respiratory tract infection, and palpitations. 
9.3.1 Contraindications:  
None known
9.3.2 Special  Warnings and Precautions for Use
JNJ-18038683 is  an investigational drug, with safety data available from 
nonclinical animal studies, as well as single and multiple dose clinical studies in 
healthy volunteers. 
All individuals  should be closely monitored by means of adverse events, vital 
signs, ECGs, and clinical laboratory safety tests of blood and urine. 
The liver,  lung, prostate, mammary gland, hematologic system, and thymus in 
rats (mainly at high dose), and the hematologic system and spleen in dogs, were 
identified as potential target organs for JNJ-18038683 in repeat-dose oral toxicity 
studies (see Other Effects in Investigator Brochure). Female animals appeared to 
be more susceptible than males.
Thus far  in clinical trials, there have been no laboratory abnormalities of concern, 
but the following safety tests should be monitored:
Hematologic  parameters: red blood cell (RBC), hemoglobin, hematocrit, 
unconjugated bilirubin, reticulocyte, and platelet counts;
Liver function:  aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT), 
gamma glutamyltransferase (GGT), prothrombin time, total bilirubin, lactic 
dehydrogenase, serum albumin, and protein.
9.3.3 Interaction  with other medications
After single  and multiple doses of JNJ-18038683, limited or no inhibition of 
CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 activity may be expected, while moderate inhibition of 
CYP2C19 activity, and strong inhibition of CYP2D6 activity may be likely. JNJ-
18038683 increased the rate of T4 glucuronidation. There was no induction of 
CYPs 1A2, 3A4, 2C9, and 2C19 by JNJ-18038683.
9.3.4 Adverse  Event Monitoring
Adverse event  data collection and reporting, which are required as part of every 
clinical trial, are done to ensure the safety of individuals enrolled in the studies as 
IRB #: STU00200919 Approved by NU IRB for use on or after 3/8/2021 through 3/7/2022.
15 Version  Date 02.04.2019well as  those who will enroll in future studies using similar agents. Adverse 
events are reported in a routine manner at scheduled times during a trial. 
Additionally, certain adverse events must be reported in an expedited manner to 
allow for optimal monitoring of patient safety and care. 
All individuals  experiencing an adverse event, regardless of its relationship to 
study drug, will be monitored until: 
 the  adverse event resolves or the symptoms or signs that constitute the 
adverse event return to baseline; 
 any  abnormal laboratory values have returned to baseline; 
 there is  a satisfactory explanation other than the study drug for the 
changes observed; or
 death.
9.3.5 Definitions
9.3.5.1 Definition  of Adverse Event
An adverse event  (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient receiving 
study treatment and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with 
this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign 
(including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally 
associated with the use of an experimental intervention, whether or not related to 
the intervention. 
9.3.5.2 Severity  of Adverse Events
The severity  of an AE is graded as follows:
Mild (grade 1):  the event causes discomfort without disruption of normal daily 
activities.
Moderate (grade 2):  the event causes discomfort that affects normal daily 
activities.
Severe (grade  3): the event makes the patient unable to perform normal daily 
activities or significantly  affects his/her clinical status.
Life-threatening (grade 4):  the patient was at risk of death at the time of the 
event.
Fatal (grade  5): the event caused death.
9.3.5.3 Serious  Adverse Events
A “serious”  adverse event is defined in regulatory terminology as any untoward 
medical occurrence that:
IRB #: STU00200919 Approved by NU IRB for use on or after 3/8/2021 through 3/7/2022.
16 Version  Date 02.04.2019 Results  in death.
If  death results from (progression of) the disease, the disease 
should be reported as event (SAE) itself.
 Is  life-threatening.
(the  patient was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not 
refer to an event that hypothetically might have caused death if it 
were more severe).
 Requires in-patient  hospitalization or prolongation of existing 
hospitalization for ≥ 24 hours.
 Results  in persistent or significant disability or incapacity.
 Is  a congenital anomaly/birth defect
 Is  an important medical event
Any event that  does not meet the above criteria, but that in the judgment of the 
investigator jeopardizes the patient, may be considered for reporting as a serious 
adverse event. The event may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 
one of the outcomes listed in the definition of “Serious Adverse Event“. 
For example:  allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an 
emergency room or at home; convulsions that may not result in hospitalization; 
development of drug abuse or drug dependency.
9.3.6 Steps  to Determine If an Adverse Event Requires Expedited 
Reporting
Step 1 : Identify the type of adverse event  
Step 2 : Grade the adverse event 
Step 3 : Determine whether the adverse event is related to the protocol therapy 
Attribution categories  are as follows:
- Definite  – The AE is clearly related to the study treatment.
- Probable  – The AE is likely related to the study treatment.
- Possible – The  AE may be related to the study treatment.
- Unrelated  – The AE is clearly NOT related to the study treatment.
Note: This includes  all events that occur within 30 days of the last dose of 
protocol treatment. Any event  that occurs more than 30 days after the last dose 
of treatment and is attributed (possibly, probably, or definitely) to the agent(s) 
must also be reported accordingly.
Step 4 : Determine the prior experience of the adverse event. 
IRB #: STU00200919 Approved by NU IRB for use on or after 3/8/2021 through 3/7/2022.
17 Version  Date 02.04.2019Expected events  are those that have been previously identified as resulting from 
administration of the agent. An adverse event is considered unexpected, for 
expedited reporting purposes only, when either the type of event or the severity 
of the event is not listed in:
 the  current known adverse events listed in the Agent Information Section 
of this protocol;
 the  GRAS dossier for the supplement;
9.3.7 Reporting  Requirements for Adverse Events
Expedited Reporting
 The  Principal Investigator must be notified within 24 hours of learning of 
any serious adverse events, regardless of attribution, occurring during the study 
or within 30 days of the last administration of the study drug. 
 The  investigator or site personnel will inform Janssen within 24 hours of 
notification of any serious adverse event by phone or fax, with follow-up with a 
written narrative of the event within 48 hours.
 The  Northwestern University Institutional Review Board must be notified 
within 10 business days of “any unanticipated problems involving risk to 
individuals or others” 
The following  events meet the definition of Unanticipated Problem Reporting 
(UPR):
1. Any  serious event (injuries, side effects, deaths or other problems), which 
in the opinion of the Principal Investigator was unanticipated, involved risk to 
individuals or others, and was possibly related to the research procedures.
2. Any  serious accidental or unintentional change to the IRB-approved 
protocol that alters the level of risk.
3. Any  deviation from the protocol taken without prior IRB review to eliminate 
apparent immediate hazard to a research subject.
4. Any  new information (e.g., publication, safety monitoring report, updated 
sponsor safety report), interim result or other finding that indicates an unexpected 
change to the risk/benefit ratio for the research.
5. Any  breach in confidentiality that may involve risk to the subject or others.
6. Any  complaint of a subject that indicates an unanticipated risk or that 
cannot be resolved by the Principal Investigator.
 The  FDA will be notified within 7 business days of any unexpected fatal or 
life-threatening adverse event with possible relationship to study drug, and 15 
business days of any event that is considered: 1) serious, 2) unexpected, and 3) 
at least possibly related to study participation.
IRB #: STU00200919 Approved by NU IRB for use on or after 3/8/2021 through 3/7/2022.
18 Version  Date 02.04.2019Routine Reporting
 All  other adverse events- such as those that are expected, or are unlikely 
or definitely not related to the study participation- are to be reported annually to 
the Northwestern IRB as part of regular data submission.
9.3.8 Unblinding  Procedures
The blind should not be  broken unless subject has completed all study 
procedures and the data has been locked. Emergency unblinding is expected to 
be infrequent.
Emergency unblinding should  occur only if the principal investigator (or other 
treating physician) considers breaking the blind medically relevant. All individuals 
who have the blind broken will be discontinued from the study. Documentation of 
the reasons for unblinding, including date and time will be recorded in the source 
documents and the electronic case report form (eCRF).
9.4 Study  Materials 
9.4.1 Structured Clinical  Interview for DSM-IV (SCID) 
The SCID-CT  is a short semi-structured interview. With an administration time of 
approximately 15 minutes, it was designed to meet the need for a short but 
accurate structured psychiatric interview for multicenter clinical trials and 
epidemiology. The SCID-CT will be administered by raters at the study site. The 
SCID-CT must be administered by a site study staff member listed on the site 
delegation of authority log with at least 2 years of experience with the population 
under study. The results of this assessment will be used to confirm the diagnosis 
of bipolar disorder I or II and rule out any exclusionary diagnosis. The SCID will be 
administered at the screening visit. 
9.4.2 Cognition battery  
The “Cleveland”  cognition battery will be administered in this trial, which the PI 
has used over the past 30+ years as measures of the following cognitive 
domains: executive functioning, speed of processing, attention/vigilance, working 
memory, verbal learning, visual learning, reasoning and problem solving
This battery includes  the following assessments:
 Wisconsin  Card Sorting Test (WCST)
 Digit  Symbol Task
 Rey  Auditory Verbal Learning Test (Rey-AVLT)
 WISC-III  Mazes
 Category  Fluency Test
 Verbal  Fluency
 Brown-Peterson  Consonant Trigram Memory Task
IRB #: STU00200919 Approved by NU IRB for use on or after 3/8/2021 through 3/7/2022.
19 Version  Date 02.04.2019The cognition  battery will be administered at baseline and end of study. 
9.4.3 Montgomery  Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) [35] - 
The MADRS  will be utilized to assess a subject’s level of depressive symptoms 
and must be administered using a structured interview guide. This scale consists 
of 10 items each with 7 defined grades of severity
9.4.4 Young Mania  Rating Scale (YMRS) [36]- 
The YMRS  consists of 11 items assessing the core symptoms of mania and is 
based on the subject’s subjective report of his or her clinical condition. Additional 
information is based upon clinical observations made during the course of the 
clinical interview. Each item has 5 defined categories of severity with 4 items 
graded on a 0 to 8 scale (irritability, speech, content, and disruptive-aggressive 
behavior) and 7 items graded on a 0 to 4 scale.
9.4.6 Clinical  Global Impression Scale – Bipolar (CGI-BP) [37] - 
The CGI-BP  scale refers to the global impression of the subject with respect to 
bipolar disorder. The scale rates the subject’s Severity of Illness (CGI-BP-
Severity: mania, depression, and overall bipolar illness) and Change from 
Preceding Phase (CGI-BP Change from Preceding Phase: mania, depression, 
and overall bipolar illness) based on a 7-point scale. Severity of Illness (CGI-BP-
Severity) will be rated at the baseline visit. The Change from Preceding Phase 
(CGI-BP Change from Preceding Phase) will be rated at the end of study visit 
(Week 9).
9.4.7 Specific Levels  of Functioning (SLOF) [33] -
The SLOF is a  clinician-rated assessment that evaluates functional behaviors in 
the context of the individual’s skills and abilities. It consists of 43 items 
categorized into 6 subscales: Physical functioning; Personal care skills; 
Interpersonal relationships; Social acceptability; Activities of community living; 
and Work skills. Each question is rated on a 5-point scale. The higher the total 
score, the better the overall functioning of the subject. According to the original 
version of the scale, the time frame covered by the survey is the past week. 
While an informant is not required for this trial, access to a person that can 
provide collateral (caseworker, caregiver, etc.) is preferred, as the SLOF asks 
them for any other relevant information, and also includes a rating for how well 
the informant knows the subject. The SLOF will be performed at the baseline and 
end of study visits. 
9.4.8 Physical  Examination 
The physical  exams must be performed by the PI or designee (or a licensed 
medical practitioner such as a physician’s assistant or nurse practitioner) listed 
on the site delegation of authority log. 
IRB #: STU00200919 Approved by NU IRB for use on or after 3/8/2021 through 3/7/2022.
20 Version  Date 02.04.2019A complete physical examination includes  the following assessments: general 
appearance, head, eyes, ears/nose/throat, neck, lymph nodes, skin, lungs, heart, 
abdomen, musculoskeletal, and neurologic evaluations. If the subject is 
discontinued for any reason during the treatment phase, every attempt should be 
made to perform a final physical examination.
9.4.9 Vital  Signs 
Arterial systolic  and diastolic blood pressure and radial artery pulse rate will be 
measured while the patient is seated at the scheduled visits designated in the 
Schedule of Events in Appendix 1. 
9.4.9.1 Height  and Body Weight 
Height will  be measured at the screening visit. Patients will be measured without 
shoes. Body weight will be recorded at screening, baseline and every visit through 
the 9-week treatment phase. 
9.4.9.2 Body  Mass Index (BMI) 
Body mass index  (BMI) will be determined with the patient’s height and weight at 
the screening visit and subsequent treatment visits. BMI must be calculated using 
the following formula: A person’s (Weight in pounds divided by their height in 
inches squared) x 703. 
9.4.9.3 Waist  and Hip Circumference 
Waist and  hip circumference will be recorded at screening, baseline, and all study 
visits. 
9.4.10 Electrocardiogram  (12-Lead ECG) 
The PI  or a physician listed on the site delegation of authority log must review, 
initial, and date the report, which must be filed in the subject’s study chart. 
Results will be captured in the subject’s study chart, not in the electronic 
database. Clinically significant findings from the screening report must be 
captured in the medical history. Eligibility for study entry must be assessed by the 
principal investigator. Any clinically significant changes compared with baseline 
must be captured as AEs in the electronic database. 
Individuals are  to be supine for at least 5 minutes prior to ECG assessments. A 
central facility will be used in this study for interpretation and analysis of ECGs. 
All individuals will have standard resting 12-lead ECGs performed and 
interpreted. The time the ECG is performed will be recorded (using a 24-h clock). 
In addition, the time that the subject took their last dose of study medication (prior 
to the ECG) will be recorded on the CRF page.
9.4.11 Adverse  Event (AE) Monitoring 
The PI  or a designee (eg, a licensed, qualified medical practitioner such as a 
physician’s assistant or a nurse practitioner) listed on the site delegation of 
authority log must assess the severity and relationship to study medication(s) of 
all AEs. All observed or volunteered AEs regardless of treatment group or 
IRB #: STU00200919 Approved by NU IRB for use on or after 3/8/2021 through 3/7/2022.
21 Version  Date 02.04.2019suspected causal  relationship to the investigational product(s) will be recorded on 
the AE page(s) of the electronic database. 
For all  AEs, the investigator must pursue and obtain information adequate both to 
determine the outcome of the AE and to assess whether it meets the criteria for 
classification as an SAE requiring immediate notification to the Sponsor or its 
designated representative. 
For all  AEs, sufficient information should be obtained by the investigator to 
determine the causality of the AE. The investigator is required to assess causality 
and indicate that assessment on the source document and electronic database. 
For AEs with a causal relationship to the investigational product, follow-up by the 
investigator is required until the event or its sequelae resolve or stabilize at a 
level acceptable to the investigator. 
Adverse events  (serious and non-serious) should be recorded on the source 
document and electronic medical record from the date the informed consent form 
(ICF) was signed until the end of their participation in the study, ie, the subject 
has discontinued or completed the study. 
9.4.12 Concomitant  Medications 
Concomitant Medications  will be documented using the Concomitant Medications 
form at Baseline and all study visits. 
9.4.13 Study  Medication Adherence 
Participants will  be asked about his/her medication adherence at each 
appointment. Study personnel will count and record the number of pills in the 
patient’s study medication bottles and provide immediate feedback, reinforcing 
the behaviors of patients who appear to be taking medications as prescribed and 
problem-solving with those who appear not to be. Clinicians will review with 
patients the use of pill-minder boxes, as needed.
9.4.14 Laboratory  Test Assessments 
Northwestern Medicine  Laboratory and South Bend Medical Foundation will be 
used for analysis of fasting lab assessments required during the study. Blood will 
be drawn from each patient at the screening visit, and at end of study as noted in 
the study Schedule of Events in Appendix 1. The tests will include: Chemistry 
panels; Hematologic parameters: red blood cell (RBC), hemoglobin, hematocrit, 
unconjugated bilirubin, reticulocyte, and platelet counts; Liver function: aspartate 
transaminase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT), gamma glutamyltransferase 
(GGT), prothrombin time, total bilirubin, lactic dehydrogenase, albumin, protein, 
creatinine.  A  urine drug screen (UDS) will be obtained at screening only.
In women of childbearing  potential, serum pregnancy testing will occur at 
screening; urine pregnancy will occur at study baseline.   
IRB #: STU00200919 Approved by NU IRB for use on or after 3/8/2021 through 3/7/2022.
22 Version  Date 02.04.2019Note: At  screening and throughout study participation, a positive UDS is not 
necessarily exclusionary and/or may not require a subject be withdrawn from the 
study. This decision will be per the discretion of the principal investigator.
9.5 Safety Scales 
9.5.1 Abnormal Involuntary  Movement Scale (AIMS) 
The AIMS  is a clinician-rated assessment of abnormal movements consisting of 
unobtrusive observation of the subject at rest (with shoes removed) and several 
questions or instructions directed toward the subject. Using a severity scale 
ranging from 0 (none) to 4 (severe), clinicians rate dyskinesia in several body 
regions, including the facial area, extremities, and trunk. 
9.5.2 Columbia  Suicide Severity Rating Scale 
The C-SSRS  was developed by a team of researchers at Columbia University to 
address the need for standardized classification of suicide reports to assess 
suicide risk. This scale consists of a baseline evaluation that assesses the 
lifetime experience of the subject with suicide events and suicidal ideation and a 
post-baseline evaluation that focuses on suicidality since the last study visit. A 
baseline C-SSRS will be completed at the screening visit. The C-SSRS Since 
Last Visit form will be completed at all subsequent visits and telephone calls (Day 
21, Day 35, and Day 49).
10.0 Data  and Specimen Banking
Study documentation  includes all Case Report Forms, data correction forms or 
queries, source documents, Janssen-Investigator correspondence, monitoring 
logs/letters, and regulatory documents (e.g., protocol and amendments, IRB 
correspondence and approval, signed patient consent forms).
Source documents  include all recordings of observations or notations of clinical 
activities and all reports and records necessary for the evaluation and 
reconstruction of the clinical research study.
Government agency  regulations and directives require that the study investigator 
must retain all study documentation pertaining to the conduct of a clinical trial. In 
the case of a study with a drug seeking regulatory approval and marketing, these 
documents shall be retained for at least two years after the last approval of 
marketing application in an International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) 
region. In all other cases, study documents should be kept on file until three 
years after the completion and final study report of this investigational study.
11.0 Data  and Specimen Management
11.1 Data Analysis  Plan
IRB #: STU00200919 Approved by NU IRB for use on or after 3/8/2021 through 3/7/2022.
23 Version  Date 02.04.2019The primary  analysis will be a mixed model repeated measures ANCOVA 
adjusting for baseline differences in dependent measures, sex and race. Missing 
data will be imputed by MMRM. We would also examine some variables 
categorically. 
Assumptions for  the power analysis included random assignment into one group 
receiving placebo and one JNJ-18038683. The cognitive battery, as the primary 
instrument, will be collected at baseline and at end point (8 weeks).  Using 
repeated measure ANCOVA, the time average difference in the response 
variable will be compared between groups to detect treatment difference. Based 
on Javitt et al,  2012, we assume the mean baseline verbal learning score will be 
36.2, SD 9.4 for both groups.  We are assuming the placebo group will show no 
improvement while the treatment group will improve a mean of 5 points, a 
medium effect.  We assume the correlation coefficient of repeated observation to 
be 0.5 and the covariance structure to be compound symmetry. The power 
calculation was conducted with alpha level of 0.05 using one-sided and two-sided 
tests. Full results are available upon request. With a one sided test, 33 
individuals per group are required assuming 5 points improvement of the 
treatment group compared to the placebo for the desired power of 80% with 
alpha level of 0.05. We plan to recruit 36 per group to account for drop outs. In 
the two sided test the sample size per group is 42.

11.2 Data Management  and Monitoring/Auditing
A database  in the RedCap system will be used for data entry and will be formatted 
to simulate the hard copy data entry forms.  Once entered into this database, the 
data files can be extracted into Excel or SAS project databases, which are 
maintained on a networked directory under the direct supervision of the PI and 
biostatistician.  Back-ups are routinely performed to assure the preservation of the 
database. Data are checked for range, consistency, missing values, etc. During 
data analysis, combined datasets are created as needed.  Data are maintained in 
the master system datasets using a source/derived data approach, where source 
datasets are maintained unmodified, while the derived datasets are modified as 
needed.  Thus, alterations that prove to be incorrect are easily rectified. The 
confidentiality of all data is maintained using the HIPAA compliance standards of 
Northwestern University. No confidential information is posted to the web under 
IRB #: STU00200919 Approved by NU IRB for use on or after 3/8/2021 through 3/7/2022.
24 Version  Date 02.04.2019any circumstances.  All  possible efforts are made to retain only the necessary 
information in all cases.
Regarding de-identification  of the data set: No identifiable information for any 
individuals (i.e. name, initials or date of birth) will be collected in the analyzable 
RedCap database or directly linked to study data. Individuals will be coded only 
with study-specific unique ID numbers. 
12.0 Provisions  to Monitor the Data to Ensure the Safety of 
Individuals
The Principal  Investigator is responsible for the conduct of the clinical trial at the 
site in accordance with Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations and/or the 
Declaration of Helsinki. The Principal Investigator is responsible for personally 
overseeing the treatment of all study patients. The Principal Investigator must 
assure that all study site personnel, including sub-investigators and other study 
staff members, adhere to the study protocol and all FDA/GCP/NCI regulations 
and guidelines regarding clinical trials both during and after study completion.
The Principal  Investigator at each institution or site will be responsible for 
assuring that all the required data will be collected and entered onto the Case 
Report Forms. Periodically, monitoring visits will be conducted and the Principal 
Investigator will provide access to his/her original records to permit verification of 
proper entry of data. At the completion of the study, all case report forms will be 
reviewed by the Principal Investigator and will require his/her final signature to 
verify the accuracy of the data.
13.0 Withdrawal  of Individuals*
Individuals can  be taken off the study treatment and/or study at any time at their 
own request, or they may be withdrawn at the discretion of the investigator for 
safety, behavioral or administrative reasons. The reason(s) for discontinuation will 
be documented and may include:
 Individual voluntarily  withdraws from treatment (follow-up permitted); 
 Individual withdraws consent (termination  of treatment and follow-up);
 Individual is unable  to comply with protocol requirements;
 Individual experiences toxicity  that makes continuation in the protocol 
unsafe;
 Physician judges  continuation on the study would not be in the patient’s best 
interest;
 Individual becomes pregnant  (pregnancy to be reported along same 
timelines as a serious adverse event).
14.0 Risks  to Individuals*
The risks  from the study procedures include:
IRB #: STU00200919 Approved by NU IRB for use on or after 3/8/2021 through 3/7/2022.
25 Version  Date 02.04.2019In a 7  week, randomized, placebo controlled trial comparing JNJ-18038683 with 
placebo and escitalopram (an active comparator), a total of 6 serious adverse 
events were reported during the study (placebo group: spontaneous abortion and 
suicidal ideation; escitalopram group: spontaneous abortion, suicidal ideation, 
suicide attempt, and chest discomfort). A total of 10 individuals (3 in the placebo 
group, 4 in the JNJ-18038683 group, and 3 in the escitalopram group) were 
withdrawn from the study prematurely due to adverse events. Only 3 individuals 
receiving the 20-mg dose of JNJ 18038683 required dose reductions at any point 
during the study.
Adverse events  that were reported in more than 5% of individuals in any 
treatment group included headache, nausea, nasopharyngitis, insomnia, 
somnolence, dyspepsia, dizziness, dry mouth, constipation, diarrhea, vomiting, 
back pain, upper respiratory tract infection, palpitations, and fatigue. The 
treatment-emergent adverse events that were reported more frequently in the 
JNJ 18038683 group compared with the placebo or escitalopram groups included 
dyspepsia, constipation, upper respiratory tract infection, and palpitations. 
The clinical interview  questions may result in temporary discomfort when asking 
the subject about a potentially difficult time in the past or the psychiatric symptoms 
they experience in the case of psychiatric participants.  There may be temporary 
discomfort/ bruising at the site of venipuncture.  
It is  believed the potential benefits outweigh the risks for this trial.
In case  of a medical emergency and risk of suicidality, the study team will follow 
the emergency protocol outlined in the Appendix 3.  
15.0 Potential Benefits  to Individuals
The possible  benefits to the individuals who participate in this study are 
improvement in cognitive function and residual depressive symptoms, but there 
may be no direct benefit.  Research staff could provide information from screening 
evaluations to the subject’s clinical treatment team if requested by the subject. 
Findings from this study may benefit others.  Participation will allow us to learn 
about the potential cognitive enhancing effects of JNJ-18038683 in patients with 
bipolar disorder, and its effect on depressive symptoms, which would inform further 
studies evaluating its use to treat cognitive deficits among various clinical 
populations.
16.0 Vulnerable  Populations
This research  study does involve cognitively impaired adults, as the 
primary endpoint is examining the effect of the study medication on the 
cognitive impairment associated with bipolar disorder (CIABP).
IRB #: STU00200919 Approved by NU IRB for use on or after 3/8/2021 through 3/7/2022.
26 Version  Date 02.04.2019To ensure  that each subject’s rights and welfare are protected, we confirm 
the following:
The competency  of patients to give informed consent will be evaluated in a 
multifaceted manner. The majority of patients who participate in our research are 
referred to us by clinicians.  Prior to participating in any protocol-related 
procedures, and as per the standard operating procedure, research clinicians 
explain the nature of the protocol to the patient, the risks and benefits, and the 
option not to participate in research. They have been instructed by us not to refer 
patients they believe are incompetent or grossly disorganized. This process of 
assessment and explanation is then repeated by the clinician involved in the 
research project, often in the presence of clinical staff, and by the research 
assistant involved in the research project. They first do a clinical assessment to 
determine if the patient might be appropriate for the project in terms of its 
inclusion and exclusion provisions. During this clinical assessment, they do a 
mental status examination, which assesses the patient’s memory, attention, and 
thinking processes. If these are impaired to the point where the person appears 
to be unable to understand the nature of the research project, its risks and 
benefits, or the option not to participate, they will not be approached to be in 
research.  If they are not excluded for this or other reasons, e.g. patient is a risk 
to themselves or others, one of the subinvestigators on the study or the PI will 
explain the protocol, go carefully over the consent form, provide help to the 
patient, if needed, to review the written protocol and consent, ask question to the 
patient to determine their level of comprehension, and then answer all questions 
the patient may have about the study. This will often be done in the presence of a 
clinical staff member not directly connected to the research or minimally involved. 
This type of assessment is repeated as needed during the course of the protocol 
if there is a question about loss of competency, although it is expected that 
competency will increase rather than decrease because of the beneficial effects 
of the treatments. Where the research staff feels the decision as to competency 
is questionable, the patient will be excluded from research. In a few cases, we 
may ask a clinician not connected to the research to do an independent 
evaluation their decision will be decisive. 
Individuals will  be regularly evaluated for the increase of cognitive deficits.   If 
and when increased cognitive deficits emerge, the P.I. or sub-investigator will 
assess for any impairments in judgment that might affect the subject’s ability to 
judge if he or she should continue to participate.  If there are any conflicts about 
the impairment of a given patient, the P.I, Herbert Y. Meltzer, will request Dr. 
John Csernansky, Chairman of the Feinberg School of Medicine Department of 
Psychiatry, to evaluate the patient.  Dr. Csernansky will then independently 
determine if he believes that the patient is continuing to give consent and if 
continued participation is in the patient’s best interest.  If Dr. Csernansky 
determines that the patient has withdrawn consent or that continuing is not in his 
or her best interest, the subject will be withdrawn from continued participation 
and referred for appropriate follow-up treatment. If and when increased cognitive 
deficits emerge in a subject at the Beacon Medical Group Behavioral Health 
IRB #: STU00200919 Approved by NU IRB for use on or after 3/8/2021 through 3/7/2022.
27 Version  Date 02.04.2019South Bend site,  the same process will take place as at the Northwestern 
University. If there are any conflicts about the impairment of a given patient, the 
P.I will ask an independent psychiatrist from the Beacon Medical Group 
Behavioral Health South Bend, South Bend, IN to evaluate the patient. This 
psychiatrist will then independently determine if he/she believes that the patient 
is continuing to give consent and if continued participation is in the patient’s best 
interest.  
The risk  of the study is low, and are reasonable in relation to the potential 
benefits. Individuals cannot access alternative pharmacologic treatment 
for CIABP, as there is no approved treatment.
17.0 Sharing of  Results with Individuals
All information  will be kept confidential except such as is necessary to disclose in 
order to provide appropriate medical care to a study participant, in which case 
the participant will be notified and their healthcare provider will be contacted via 
phone and/or fax. If a participant is found to have severe depression, they will be 
referred to appropriate health care providers. If a participant’s blood tests positive 
for Hepatitis B, local laws may require that the result be reported to local health 
authorities.
18.0 Setting
Participants will  be identified as eligible according to diagnosis, severity of 
symptoms and ability to give informed consent. Staff affiliated with this 
research study will conduct chart reviews as allowed by mental health 
centers to determine eligibility based on treatment history.
All research  procedures will be performed at either the Northwestern 
University Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Science offices 
located at 680 N. Lake Shore Dr., Suite 1410, Chicago, IL 60611 or the 
Stone Mental Health Center, located at 446 E Ontario St, Rooms 6-344 
and 6-343, Chicago, IL 60611. For the Beacon Medical Group Behavioral 
Health South Bend site all research procedures will be done at either the 
Beacon Medical Group Behavioral Health South Bend 707 N. Michigan St 
Suite 400 South Bend, IN 46601 or the South Bend Medical Foundation

19.2 Patients  will be recruited from several clinical sites with whom we have 
worked closely over the last three years. Our lab has trained and certified 
coordinators and research assistants who will be assigned to this study as 
their primary responsibility. We have used a variety of cognitive batteries 
for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in many studies over the last five 
years.  Our project statistician and research staff are proficient at electronic 
data capture (RedCap) which we will utilize for this study.  
20.0 Prior Approvals
Approval will  be obtained from the Northwestern University IRB and the 
study sponsor, Janssen Research and Development, before commencing 
the research study.
21.0 Recruitment  Methods
Participants aged  18-60 with bipolar disorder of at least one year duration, as 
established by SCID-I, will be recruited for this study. Participants will be 
identified as eligible according to diagnosis, severity of symptoms and ability to 
give informed consent. The clinical treatment providers of potentially eligible 
participants will be notified of the inclusion and exclusion criteria for the study, by 
way of written communication or regularly scheduled presentations to the 
providers (e.g. lunch presentations, weekly therapist meetings, etc.), and will be 
asked to discuss the study with potential candidates. The research staff will meet 
with the participants only after notification of the current provider of psychiatric 
IRB #: STU00200919 Approved by NU IRB for use on or after 3/8/2021 through 3/7/2022.
29 Version  Date 02.04.2019services and after  the participants have expressed interest in taking part in 
research. 
We will  utilize referrals from primary care or psychiatry providers, or from 
participant interest and consent. We will also be recruiting individuals through the 
NU-SRG Recruitment Pipeline (STU00059328).
As part  of the NU-SRG Recruitment Pipeline, research staff will first read 
individuals a verbal consent, where they can indicate if they are interested in 
completing a screening form and if we can hold onto their information and 
contact them for future research opportunities. We have prepared handouts with 
a flow chart to help guide candidates and clinicians to determine if candidates are 
preliminarily eligible for the study.  We then complete a 5-10 minute screening 
form to determine eligibility for the study. The PI, the sub-investigator, and fully 
trained research staff will determine initial prescreen eligibility. The PI will 
personally review and approve all enrollees prior to randomization.
22.0 Local  Number of Individuals
After screening for eligibility and providing written informed consent, 60 stable 
outpatients, who may have mild-moderate depressive symptoms, will be 
randomized to receive adjunctive treatment with either JNJ-18038683 or placebo. 
We propose to  study a total of 60 randomized participants, 30 receiving JNJ-
18038683 and 30 randomized to placebo.    
23.0 Confidentiality
All data that will  be stored on sites and will be maintained in locked cabinets (double lock 
rule applies). Blood specimens will be processed locally at Northwestern Memorial 
Hospital and South Bend Medical Foundation.  Only NU-IRB approved members of the 
study team will have access to the study data. De-identified data will be kept separately 
from the identified data. De-identifiable data will be entered into a RedCap data base 
that serves as an Electronic Data Capture (EDC) system,
24.0 Provisions  to Protect the Privacy Interests of Individuals
Participants will  be reminded whenever appropriate that they are at liberty to opt 
out of answering any questions or undergoing any procedures with which they 
are not comfortable, up to and including their right to rescind their participation in 
the study without any penalty unto them.
Participants must  sign an authorization for release of information before any 
sources of information can be contacted about the participant.
25.0 Compensation  for Research-Related Injury
IRB #: STU00200919 Approved by NU IRB for use on or after 3/8/2021 through 3/7/2022.
30 Version  Date 02.04.201925.1 If  the research involves more than Minimal Risk to individuals, 
describe the available compensation in the event of research-related 
injury.
25.2 Provide  a copy of contract language, if any, relevant to compensation 
for research-related injury.
26.0 Economic  Burden to Individuals
Participants may  incur costs related to transportation by participating in this 
study, and they will be reimbursed for part or all of such incurred expenses.
Individuals will be compensated at the rate of $40/visit for their time and effort. 
The total amount for visit compensation will be prorated based on subject’s 
participation. Up to $20 per visit will also be provided to cover individuals’ 
transportation and parking expenses. For any visit lasting over 4 hours $10 will 
be provided to cover subject’s lunch costs. 
27.0 Consent  Process
The informed consent form will typically first be discussed with a potential 
participant over telephone, and after the participant has considered their ability to 
participate in the study, will again formally be reviewed with the participant during 
an in-person screening visit at the Northwestern University Department of 
Psychiatry and Behavioral Science offices or at the Beacon Medical Group 
Behavioral Health South Bend. Any time that there is a change in the protocol or 
the informed consent form, the revised consent form will again be reviewed with 
and signed by the participant. Individuals obtaining consent will follow ‘SOP: 
Informed Consent Process for Research (HRP-090).’
No non-English speaking participants, minors, cognitively impaired adults, or 
adults unable to provide consent will be considered for participation in this study, 
nor will any waivers or alterations of the consent process be applied for.
28.0 Process to  Document Consent in Writing
Individuals documenting  the consent in writing will follow ‘SOP: Written 
Documentation of Consent (HRP-091).’
29.0 Drugs  or Devices
JNJ-18038683 will  be provided by Janssen Research and Development, the 
makers of JNJ-18038683, and will provide a detailed Certificate of Analysis

silicified microcrystalline cellulose, and magnesium stearate. The placebo 
formulation will be supplied as matching tablets. Detailed instructions for storage 
conditions and oral dose administration will accompany the clinical drug supplies 
to the clinical study sites.
The target dosage  will be 20 mg/day, or 2 tablets of 10 mg once per day. This will 
preserve the blind, as the placebo comparator will be also given as 2 tablets 
once per day. Individuals will receive 10 mg/day for the first week, and 20 mg 
from weeks 2-7 with a provision for a single, downward, dose adjustment.
Study clinicians  will be responsible for dispensing JNJ-18038683 at our research 
office. An unblinded study drug manager will receive and label and distribute the 
product for dispensing during the study.
At the  baseline and end of study visits, measures of safety and effectiveness will 
be administered and individuals will be evaluated for response and side effects to 
the treatment. To assess adherence to dosing of the agent, the study medication 
will be returned and counted.
Study drugs  sent by the sponsor to the study site will be stored in a locked 
cabinet and be handled only by the study coordinator, who will also 
maintain drug accountability logs and drug destruction/return logs that will 
be verified by the site monitor to ensure that study drugs have only been 
used on individuals and only by authorized investigators.

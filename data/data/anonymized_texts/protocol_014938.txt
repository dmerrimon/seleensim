ABSTRACT  
Novel therapeutic  strategies are necessary to increase cure rates for children with relapsed or refractory 
Wilms tumor, rhabdomyosarcoma , neuroblastoma and other CD56-expressing tumors such as 
pleuropulmonary blastoma, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) and synovial sarcoma. Such 
cancers nearly uniformly express tumor cell surface CD56 or NCAM (neural cell adhesion molecule). 
Antibody drug conjugate th erapies (ADCs) that target cytotoxic moieties, such as potent anti -microtubule 
poisons, directly to specific tumor cell receptors have been developed . IMGN901 (lorvotuzumab 
mertansine) is an ADC that links a potent anti -mitotic (DM1) via a disulfide linker  to CD56 targeting 
antibodies. Pre -clinical data demonstrate potent in vivo effects of IMGN901 against Wilms tumor, 
rhabdomyosarcoma, and neuroblastoma. This trial will determine the clinical effects of IMGN901 
administered on Days 1 and 8 of a 21- day cycle to  pediatric and adolescent patients with Wilms tumor, 
rhabdomyosarcoma, neuroblastoma or other CD56-expres sing tumors such as pleuropulmonary blastoma, 
malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST), and synovial sarcoma. Pharmacokinetic data, including an assessment of impact on peripheral blood CD56+ cell burden, will be obtained.

2.0 BACKGROUND  
 
2.1 Introduction/Rationale for Development  
IMGN901  (lorvotuzumab mertansine) is a humanized immunoglobulin (IgG1) kappa 
monoclonal antibody, conjugated through a disulfide linker, to the cytotoxic maytansinoid, 
DM1, with an average of 3.5 molecules DM1 per antibody. The monoclonal antibody is 
the humanized version of the murine N901 monoclonal antibody engineered to bind 
specifically with the CD56 antigen, a member of the family of neural cell adhesion molecules (NCAMs). The target CD56 antigen is expressed on the surface of tumor cells 
of neuroendocrine origin, including small cell lung cancer (S CLC), carcinoid tumors ; on 
neuroectodermal tumors, such as astrocytomas; as well as many multiple myelomas (MM) 
and ovarian cancers. CD56 is also nearly universally expressed on Wilms tumors, 
rhabdomyosarcomas, neuroblastomas,
1-12 pleuropulmonary blastoma s, malignant 
peripheral nerve sheath tumor s and synovial sarco mas.13-16 In Wilms tumor, CD56 has been 
specifically demonstrated to be a marker of the putative cancer stem cell.1,2 IMGN901 acts 
by binding to the target antigen, CD56 on tumor cells and once bound, the conjugate is 
internalized and DM1 released. Within the cell, DM1 disrupts microtubule assembly, leading to G2/metaphase arrest and ultimately cell death.

IGMN901:  
Linker 
IMGN901 was m ade using the reagent N -succinimidyl 4 -(2-pyridyldithio) pentanoate 
(SPP), which forms a stable disulfide link between the huN901 antibody and DM1  
(Figure 1). 
 
Antibody, huN901  
N901, a murine monoclonal antibody of the immunoglobulin G (IgG) 1 subclass, was 
originally generated as an antibody that binds specifically to natural killer (NK) cells and 
CD56-positive T -lymphocytes but is non- reactive with monocytes, B -lymphocytes, most 
T-lymphocytes that are CD56 negative, erythrocytes and platelets. The antibody binds to 
the CD56 antigen, a member of the NCAM family expressed on many tumors of 
neuroendocrine origin as outlined above. N901 also binds to about 70% of MM s and many 
ovarian cancers.

Of normal tissue screened, binding was seen with cardiac muscle cells; peripheral nerve 
tissues: neuroectodermal cells, such as astrocytes; and neuroendocrine cells of the adrenal 
gland, pancreas and thyroid gland. N901 did not bind to bladder, bone marrow, cervix, 
colon, esophagus, kidney, liver, lung, skeletal muscle, pancreatic ducts, prostate glands, 
skin, small intestine, or uterus. Binding was also seen on a subset of lymphocytes in lymph 
node, spleen, and thymus that were thought likely to be NK cells and CD56- positive T -
lymphocytes. To overcome the limited effectiveness of murine antibody conjugates due to the formation of a human anti -murine antibody response in recipients, N901 was 
humanized by complementarity determining regions (CDR) grafting to form huN901, 
which retains 100% of the binding avidity of the parent murine antibody. The antibody was 
modified to introduce active disulfide -containing groups, which react with the thiol -
containing maytansinoid, DM1, via thiol -disulfide exchange, to produce a conjugate 
containing, on average, 3.5 DM1 molecules per antibody molecule. The huN901 antibody component of IMGN901 was initially produced from a murine SP2/0 cell line (MS -151). 
Later in development, the source of the huN901 antibody component of IMGN901 was 
changed to a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)  cell line (HD -157 or ND -199) because 
antibody production by the CHO cell line is more efficient. Comparability of IMGN901 made with antibody produced from all cell lines has been demonstrated. Phase  1/2 clinical 
studies are being performed using IMGN901 made with antibody produced from the CHO 
cell lines.  
 
Cytotoxic Component, DM1 
DM1, the cytotoxic component of IMGN901, is a member of the maytansinoid family. 
Maytansinoids are mitotic inhibitors that kill cells by interfering with the formation of microtubules and depolymerization of already -formed microtubules (Figure 2) . DM1 is an 

  THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY  ADVL1522 
11 
Version Date: 07/ 09/18 
analog of the well characterized maytansinoid, maytansine. Maytansine was studied 
extensively in nonclinical and clinical studies by the National Cancer Institute (NCI). 
 
DM1 differs from maytansine in that it contains a sulfhydryl group that allows the drug to 
be linked to an antibody via disulfide bond formation.  In vitro screening showed maytansine to be 100- to 1000-fold more toxic than other 
cytotoxic drugs for a range of  human cancer cell lines. Free maytansine had a low 
therapeutic index in human clinical studies because of high systemic toxicity. However, by 
conjugating maytansinoids with antibodies via cleavable disulfide bonds, the cytotoxicity 
can be targeted specifi cally against tumor cells. The intracellular cleavage of the disulfide 
bond is important for activity. 
 
2.2 Preclinical Studies  
 
2.2.1 Antitumor Activity  
In vitro studies show that the cytotoxicity of IMGN901 is restricted to CD56-
positive cells. For examp le, IMGN901 caused potent cytotoxicity with a 
concentration resulting in  50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of approximately 
60 pM in the CD56- positive neuroblastoma cells IMR32, but was inactive in CD56 
negative colon cancer cells COLO205 at concentratio ns as high as 1.5 nM even 
though both cell lines  show similar sensitivity to non -conjugated maytansine.15 
These data indicate that IMGN901 specifically induces CD56 -dependent cytotoxic 
effects in cells expressing the target CD56 antigen , while sparing cells that do not 
express CD56 and which, therefore, cannot bind IMGN901. 
 The immune effector activity of huN901 antibody and IMGN901 and their effect 
on the function and growth of CD56- positive human primary NK cells was 
investigated in vitro. It was found that huN901 fails to mediate complement 
dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) but  induces antibody -dependent NK cell -mediated 
cytotoxicity (ADCC) in a dose -dependent manner against target cells expressing 
high levels of CD56, but not in those expressing low  levels of CD56. IMGN901 
showed ADCC activity comparable to huN901 antibody alone, suggesting that DM1 conjugation did not alter the interaction between the Fc domain of the 
antibody and the Fc receptor of NK cells.
17  
 Adult Tumors Pre -Clinical Testing:  Studies evaluating the in vivo efficacy of 
IMGN901 were conducted in severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice 
bearing subcutaneous xenografts of adult -derived human tumor cell lines derived 
from SCLC, MM and ovarian cancer. In these studies, IMGN901 showed marked efficacy, including complete regressions in some animals.
17-21  
 
Pediatric Tumors Pre -Clinical Testing:   
CD56 is well known to be expressed in all blastemal dominant Wilms tumors 
(typical at relapse) , the majority of epithelial Wilms tumor components as well, all 
rhabdomyosarcomas, all neuroblastomas  and the majority of pleuropulmonary 
blastomas, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors and synov ial sarcomas.4,13-

Version Date: 07/ 09/18 
The Pediatric Preclinical Testing Program tested IMGN901 against a panel of solid 
tumor models. In vitro experiments demonstrated low nanomolar IC50s against 
both rhabdomyosarcoma and neuroblastoma models. In vivo experiments, using a 
weekly x 3 schedule of 15 mg/kg/dose, demonstrated objective responses in 9/24 
(38%) models. Specifically, 2/2  Wilms tumor models (KT10 and KT11) 
demonstrated sustained  complete remissio ns (2/2); 2/7 rhabdomyosarcoma 
models, which were both alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma s, demonstrated sustained  
complete remission s (RH30 and RH65) with an embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma 
model (RH36)  demonstrated growth stas is; and 3/7 neuroblastoma models 
demonstrated complete responses  (NB-SD, NB-1643, NB-1382).3 Additional 
investigation of a Wilms tumor cancer stem cell xenograft model, representing a 
CD56+ blastemal -type Wilms tumor, demonstrated complete responses to 
IMGN901.1,2  
 
2.2.2 Animal Toxicology  
Nonclinical safety evaluation of IMGN901 has focused on studies in cynomolgus 
monkey due to the lack of cross -reactivity to the antigen in non-primate species. 
The principal target organ for this species is the peripheral and central nervous 
system (spinal cord). In a single dose study, single bolus IV infusion of IMGN901 
(152 and 456 mg/m2) was associated with dose- dependent minimal to mild 
findings of axonal degeneration of peripheral nerves and spinal cord. Repeat dosing was investigated on a weekly schedule (24 to 228 mg/m
2 for six weeks) and 
daily schedule (2.4 to 114 mg/m2 for five days). At the lowest weekly dose tested 
(24 mg/m2) minimal lesions in the spinal cord only were noted. Higher dose levels 
(> 24 mg/m2 weekly or daily) were associated with lesions of the peripheral (sciatic 
and peroneal) and central (cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spinal) nerves.  
 
The skin was also a target org an, with clinical changes relating to hyperkeratosis 
(peeling, flaking, cracking, etc.) after a single dose of 456 mg/m2 or at repeated 
doses of ≥114 mg/m2 weekly. Skin darkening correlated with increased amounts 
of melanin pigment and prominent melanocyte s in the skin were observed 
following repeat doses of ≥ 24 mg/m2 daily or ≥ 114 mg/m2 weekly.  
 Changes in markers of hepatic function were limited to rises in transaminases and 
serum alkaline phosphatase (ALK) in the highest single dose tested (456 mg/m
2) 
and transient rises in serum ALK activity with repeat daily doses of 114 mg/m2. 
There were no changes in markers of renal function.  
 
Treatment -related bone marrow suppression, leading to pancytopenia, and effects 
on the gastrointestinal (GI) system includ ing enteropathy, affecting the small and 
large intestines, characterized by loss, dilatation and epithelial regeneration of 
intestinal crypts were seen in animals receiving the highest repeat daily dose of 
(114 mg/m2).17  
 
2.2.3 Preclinical Pharmacokinetic Studies  
Briefly, pre-clinical pharmacokinetic studies in animals have demonstrated that the 
clearance of the antibody moiety of IMGN901 is similar to that of “naked” humanized antibody, with a t
1/2 in mice of about five days for the antibody. Thus, 
conjugation of an average of 3.5 molecules of DM1 to huN901 does not 
  THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY  ADVL1522 
13 
Version Date: 07/ 09/18 
appreciably alter the PK properties of the huN901 antibody itself. IMGN901 t 1/2 is 
approximately two days (55 hours) in mice and 30 hours in monkeys. The shorter 
t1/2 in monkeys may be due to CD56 binding, since IMGN901 cross -reacts with 
monkey CD56, but not murine CD56. The highest percentage of injected dose is found in the blood, liver, spleen, and kidney. 
 In mice, clearance was biphasic: an initial rapid decline was followed, after about 
eight hours, by a slower rate of disappearance that followed first order kinetics (overall elimination phase) with an overall clearance rate of 2 to 3 mL/h/kg. In 
monkeys, the maximum concentrati on (Cmax) and the area under the curve (AUC
0-
inf) increased in an approximately dose proportional manner. The huN901 antibody 
component of IMGN901 itself had a slower clearance (t 1/2 about three days) in 
monkeys than intact IMGN901, as assessed by an assay  specific for total huN901 
antibody, whether conjugated or not. Comparison of the clearance curves for intact conjugate and total antibody (the difference between them) allows for estimation 
of the t
1/2 of the disulfide link between DM1 and the huN901 antibody, which was 
calculated to be about 50 hours in vivo. Cmax and AUC 0-inf values for total huN901 
antibody increased in an approximately dose proportional manner for the two doses (12.7 and 38 mg/kg) studied. The t
1/2, volume of distribution, and clearanc e values 
calculated for total huN901 antibody were similar at the two doses of IMGN901. The relatively short t
1/2 for total huN901 antibody (approximately three days) in 
monkeys relative to that expected for a human IgG1 antibody (approximately 10 days) al so suggests a contribution from CD56 mediated clearance in this 
species. No monkey anti- IMGN901 antibodies were detected.  
 The tissue distribution in mice of 125I -huN901 antibody was compared with that 
of 125I-labelled IMGN901 conjugate, both dosed at 10 mg/kg. The pattern of 
uptake was similar at all time points and in all tissues. Distribution was characterized by a higher percentage of injected dose per gram of tissue in the 
blood, liver, spleen, and kidney for the first eight hours post -administration. At all 
time points, the highest percentage of the injected dose was in the bloodstream. These results suggest that conjugation does not alter the biodistribution of the 
antibody in vivo  in mice.

2.3 Adult Studies  
 
2.3.1 Phase 1 and 2 Studies  
To date, there have been five IMGN901 studies. Studies 001, 002, and 003 
evaluated IMGN901 as monotherapy ; Study 0005 evaluated IMGN901 
administered in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone in relapsed/refractory MM; and Study 0007 evaluated IMGN901 in combination with 
carboplatin and etoposide in patients with SCLC.
22-32  
 
As of March 2014, safety data is available on 198 patients from studies 001-003 
with single agent IMGN901. Study 001 tested weekly dosing for four weeks every 
6 weeks at doses ranging from 5  mg/m2 to 75 mg/m2. The MTD was defined as 
60 mg/m2, with DLTs at 75 mg/m2 including headache with meningitis -like 
symptoms. Frequent AEs included headache, peripheral sensory neuropathy, 
nausea, fatigue, vomiting, rigors, myalgia, diarrhea, pyrexia and anorexia. 
  THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY  ADVL1522

Version Date: 07/ 09/18 
Pharmacokinetics demonstrated a t 1/2 of approximately 6 hours for doses 
≤ 10 mg/m2 and t1/2 of 16 hours at 60 mg/m2. 
 
Study 002 te sted daily infusion for 3 days every 3 weeks at doses ranging from 4 
to 94 mg/m2/dose. The RP2D was defined as 60  mg/m2 with an MTD of 75 mg/m2. 
DLTs at 94  mg/m2 were headache, fatigue and myalgia. The most frequent AEs 
were headache, nausea, fatigue, vomi ting and peripheral neuropathy. PK s 
demonstrated that the C max increased with dose and t1/2 approximated 1 day (20.6-
36.6 hours) at doses ≥ 48 mg/m2/day. 
 
Study 003 tested weekly IV infusions for 2 consecutive weeks every 3 weeks, at doses ranging from 40 -140 mg/m
2. The MTD was defined as 112 mg/m2, with 
DLTs at 140 mg/m2 including reversible acute renal insufficiency in 1 patient and 
fatigue in 1 patient. Frequent AEs  included fatigue, increased AST, increased uric 
acid, peripheral neuropathy, paresthesias, headache, constipation and diarrhea. PK findings demonstrated that the t
1/2 was 23.7 hours at the highest dose tested. 
 Study 005 tested weekly infusions of IMGN901 at doses of 75, 90 and 112 mg/m
2 
for 3 consecutive weeks , every 4 weeks in combination wi th lenalidomide and 
dexamethasone in patients with relapsed/refractory MM. Dose reductions due to 
late occurring toxicities prompted lowering the expansion dose level of IMGN901 
to 75 mg/m2. Most frequent AEs included peripheral neuropathy, fatigue, diarrhea, 
nausea, pyrexia, headache, muscle spasms, and cough. The t1/2 of IMGN901 was 
18.2 hours at the highest dose level.   
 
Study 0007 tested weekly infusions of IMGN901 at doses of 60, 75, 90 and 
112 mg/m2 weekly for 2 consecutive weeks every 3 weeks in comb ination with 
carboplatin and etoposide with an expansion cohort of SCLC patients. 
Myelosuppression and infection were more common on this combination therapy trial. As yet unexplained increase in infection on the IMGN901 arm vs control arm 
without IMGN901 was noted: 16% infection- associated SAEs with 11% being 
fatal vs 11% infection -associated SAEs with 4% being fatal.  On target IMGN901 
peripheral neuropathy toxicity from DM1 was dose dependent , dropping from 86% 
(36% Grade 3) (IMGN901 dose 112 mg/m
2) to 71% (11% Grade 3) (IMGN901 
dose 90 mg/m2). PKs of IMGN901 mirrored data achieved in prior trials. 
 
IMGN901 Single  Agent Safety Summary: 
Treatment -related AEs in studies 001- 003 (single agent studies) occurring in 
> 10% of patients in descending order of frequency include peripheral neuropathy 
(31%), headache (30%), fatigue (29%), nausea (27%), AST elevations , diarrhea 
and vomiting (13% each), myalgia (12%), and decreased appetite (11%). While the overall incidence of  peripheral neuropathy and paraesthesia, regardless of 
relationship to study drug, was 33% and 9%, respectively, the Grade 3 incidence was low (3% and < 1% respectively), and there were no reports of Grade 4 toxicity. 
 
Fifty-six treatment -related SAEs were observed in 26 patients (13%). The most 
commonly reported treatment -related SAEs among patients receiving single- agent 
IMGN901 include headache (3%) , constipation (2%), noninfective meningitis 
(2%, see below), and vomiting (2%). Early in clinical development of IMGN901, 
there were three cases of serious meningitis- like syndrome (meningitis -like 
  THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY  ADVL1522 
15 
Version Date: 07/ 09/18 
symptoms associated with headaches) in the single -agent studies. Following 
implementation of routine steroid prophylaxis and a slowed infusion rate, no 
additional r eports of non -infective meningitis  have been documented and Grade 3 
and Grade 4 headache have not been reported at the MTD in any of these studies.  
 
Some less frequently reported (less than 2%) but serious toxicities that have been 
reported with IMGN901 and were considered at least possibly related to study drug 
include fatigue (two patients), renal failure (one patient), posterior reversible 
encephalopathy syndrome (one patient), and myocardial infarction (one patient). 
For two patients receiving single -agent IMGN901 who died within 30 days after 
the last study drug dose, the cause of death was considered by the Investigator to 
be at least possibly related to study drug. One patient treated on the 001 study died 
10 days following the last dose of IMGN901, due to a retroperitoneal bleed and 
multi-organ failure that was deemed possibly related to the study treatment 
regimen. On the 002 study, one patient died 18 days following the last dose of 
IMGN901 due to bronchopneumonia that was assessed by the investigat or to be 
possibly related to study treatment. 
 
DLTs for Studies 001, 002 and 003 were as follows: •  Study 001: DLTs observed in five patients  over the course of the study included 
Grade 4 hyperesthesia; Grade 3 noninfective meningitis ( n=3); and single events 
of Grade 3 fatigue, headache, and peripheral neuropathy. 
•  Study 002: DLTs observed in six patients over the course of the study included 
single events of Grade 4 fatigue and headache ; and single events of Grade 3 
headache, myalgia, pain, paresthesia, and peripheral neuropathy. 
•  Study 003: DLTs observed in five patients over the course of the study included  
single events of  Grade 3 fatigue, Grade 3 asthenia, Grade 3 lipase, Grade 3 renal 
failure, Grade 2 fatigue and two events of Grade 3 peripheral neuropathy in one 
patient, 
 
Studies (001, 002, 003): Laboratory Abnormalities: Of the 198 patients across the three single -agent studies, 97% reported at least one 
abnormality. At least one hematologic abnormality of Grade 3 or 4 was reported in 35% and 1% of patients, respectively, with the most common Grade 3 or 4 
abnormality being lymphocyte count decreased (29%). All but one patient in the single-agent studies reported at least one serum chemistry abnormality. At least 
one abnormality of Grade 3 or 4 was reported in 46% and 8% of patients, 
respectively. Most results were Grade 1 or 2 in intensity. The most common Grade 
3 and/or 4 abnormalities were hyperglycemia (18%, all Grade 3) and gamma -
glutamyl transferase (GGT) increased (12%, 10% Grade 3 and 2% Grade 4). The 
institution of corticosteroid -based prophylaxis for the prevention of headache with 
meningitis -like symptoms, which was reported early in the development of 
IMGN901 may have contributed to the high rate of hyperglycemia. Increases in  
liver function tests have also been reported, but have been asymptomatic.  
 
2.3.2 Pharmacology/Pharmacokinetics/Correlative and Biological Studies  
As of 31 March 2014, cycle 1 PK data from closed to accrual and completed 
clinical studies evaluating various dose regimens are available from Studies 001, 
002, 003, 0005 and 0007.

Version Date: 07/ 09/18 
Study 001: The clearance of IMGN901 is rapid with a t 1/2 of approximately 
six hours at the lowest doses (≤ 10 mg/m2). Clearance decreases at higher dose 
levels with the terminal elimination t1/2 being about 16 hours in the 60 mg/m2 
Phase 2 dose expansion cohort. The decreased clearance at higher doses may be 
due to the saturation of readily accessible CD56 -positive expressing cells (e.g., NK 
cells) and/or soluble CD56 at these dose le vels. 
 
Study 002: Decreased plasma clearance with increasing dose of IMGN901 was 
also observed in these patients. The Cmax and AUC 0-inf for IMGN901 from Study 
002 generally increased with dose and an observed t1/2 of approximately one day 
(20.6 to 36.6 hours) at doses ≥ 48 mg/m2/day is consistent with previous findings. 
 
Study 003 (Table 1): PK findings are similar to those observed previously with 
the t1/2 of IMGN901 approaching one day (23.4 hours) at the highest dose level. 
AUC0-inf  and C max generally increase linearly with increasing IMGN901 dose. 
 
Study 0005: PK findings are similar to those observed previously with the t1/2 of 
IMGN901 approaching one day (18.2 hours) at the highest dose level.  
 
Study 0007, Phase  1: PK findings are similar  to those observed previously with the 
t1/2 of IMGN901 approaching one day (23.4 hours) at the highest dose level for 
cohorts administered carboplatin with dose targeted to an area under the curve of 
5 and etoposide at 100 mg/m2. 
 Study 0007, Phase 2: PK f indings are similar to those observed previously, with a 
t
1/2 of IMGN901 approaching one day (27.5 and 26.9 hours at Cycle 1, Day 1, and 
Cycle 4, Day 1, respectively) when IMGN901 was dosed at 112 mg/m2 along with 
carboplatin administered at a dose targete d to an area under the curve of 5 and 
etoposide at 100 mg/m2. 
 
The total antibody component shows similar clearance to that of the intact 
conjugate in  patients. Free maytansinoid levels have been evaluated in plasma 
samples from patients treated in Study 0 03. In patients receiving between 40 and 
140 mg/m2 IMGN901, free maytansinoid levels in plasma were detected in 53% 
of the patients with the average maximal detectable level represented as 2.0 ± 0.8% 
of the maximal conjugated maytansinoid. 
 
Representative PK parameters from Study 003 are shown in Table 1 below:

2.4 Pediatric Studies  
There is no prior experience with IMGN901 in children. 
 
2.5 Overview of Proposed Pediatric Study  
This is a multi- strata Phase 2 study of IMGN901 where each stratum will be analyzed 
separately. Strata to be evaluated include Wilms tumor (Stratum 1), rhabdomyosarcoma 
(Stratum 2), neuroblastoma (Stratum 3); and strat a for miscellaneous CD56 -expressing 
tumors such as pleuropulmonary b lastoma (Stratum  4), malignant peripheral nerve sheath 
tumor (MPNST) (Stratum 5), and synovial sarcoma (Stratum 6) . IMGN901 will be 
administered weekly for two consecutive weeks every 3 weeks (Day 1 and 8 schedule of 
each 21-day cycle).  
 The dose selected  for this Phase 2 study is 110 mg/m
2/dose. This was the RP2D/MTD on 
two of the adult Phase 1 trials (rounding down from 112 mg/m2/dose), and of the schedules 
studied in adult patients, provided the highest tolerable dose intensity, 73 mg/m2/week (as 
detailed above, the maximum tolerated dose intensity on the adult Phase 1 trials were 40, 
56, 64, 75 and 75 mg/m2/week). Moreover, the weekly times two schedule every three 
weeks would be the most favorable schedule to potentially integrate into a standard 
chemotherapy regimen should sufficient activity be observed to warrant further 
development. 
 
Careful safety monitoring will include an interim safety analysis following accrual of the 
first 6 patients as well as ongoing analyses for delayed toxicity (see Section 9.0 ). Absent 
unacceptable toxicity, each stratum will continue to accrue. In the event that 110 mg/m2 is 
deemed too toxic, the next six patients will be accrued at 90  mg/m2 and a second inter im 
safety analysis conducted. Absent unacceptable toxicity, each stratum will continue to 
accrue at this dose level. In the event that 90 mg/m2 proves too toxic, the study will cease 
accrual and amendments considered.  
 
A limited sampling strategy will be e mployed to assess the pharmacokinetics of IMGN901 
from the Cycle 1, Day 1 dose. Peripheral blood will undergo analysis for CD56+ burden 

  THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY  ADVL1522 
18 
Version Date: 07/ 09/18 
(NK cell, T -cell subpopulations, for example) and considered in PK modeling. Tumor will 
be assessed for CD56 status via immunohistochemistry and correlated with response. 
 
2.6 Development Plan  
Considering the targeted nature of drug delivery via the CD56 targeting antibody drug 
conjugate and different anti -mitotic agent (maytansinoid), it is possible that IMGN901 may 
demonstrate better efficacy than vincristine in the selected tumor types and/or efficacy in 
vincristine -resistant cancers. If we reach our targeted efficacy endpoints, further 
development of CD56- Antibody Drug Conjugate based therapy could be advanced via 
integration into chemotherapy backbones targeting high- risk or recurrent/refractory Wilms 
tumor, rhabdomyosarcoma, and neuroblastoma, all of which are typically at least partially resistant to vincristine.  
  
3.0 ENROLLMENT PROCEDURES AND ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA 
3.1 Study Enrollment  
 
3.1.1 Patient Registration  
Prior to enrollment on this study, patients must be assigned a COG patient ID 
number.

4.0 TREATMENT PROGRAM  
Timing of protocol therapy administration, response assessment studies, and surgical 
interventions are based on schedules derived from the experimental design or on established 
standards of care. Minor unavoidable departures (up to 72 hours) from protocol directed therapy 
and/or disease evaluations (and up to 1 week for surgery) for valid clinical, patient and family 
logistical, or facility, procedure and/or anesthesia scheduling issues are acceptable (except 
where explicitly prohibited within the protocol). 
 
4.1 Overview of Treatment Plan  
 
4.1.1 Treatment Overview : 
 
NOTE: Accrual of the first 6 patients is limited to Phase  1 Consortium institutions. 
Subsequent enrollments are open to COG institutions within the United States . 
 
This will be a single -arm open label trial with three primary disease strata as 
outlined in the statistical section ( Section 9.0 ) and three additional  secondary strata 
for rarer cancers known to frequently express CD56. 
 
All patients will receive IMGN901 intravenously on Days 1 and 8 every 21 days. See Section 4.1.4
 for dose information. A cycle of therapy is 21 days. Treatment 
may consist of up to 17 cycles, for an approximate  total therapy duration of 
12 months, absent disease progression or unacceptable toxicity . 
 
4.1.2 Treatment Schema:  
 
IMGN901*          IMGN901*                   Evaluation  
 
            Cycle:     
Day 1  Day 8         Day 21   
 
* IMGN901 is administered via intravenous infusion. Cycle 1 Day 1 infusion will 
start at 0.02 mg/kg/min (maximum 1 mg/min) x 15 minutes and if tolerated, the 
rate may then increase to 0.06 mg/kg/min (maximum 3 mg/min ) to complete the 
infusion. If the patient tolerates the Cycle 1, Day 1 infusion, all subsequent 
infusions may be delivered at the 0.06 mg/kg/min (maximum 3 mg/min ) rate. 
 
All patients should receive pre- medication with dexamethasone . See Sections 4.2.3  
and 4.3.3 for details . 
 
Drug doses should be adjusted based on the BSA calculated from height and 
weight measured within 7 days prior to the beginning of each cycle.   
 
4.1.3 Criteria for Starting Subsequent Cycles  
A cycle may be repeated every 21  days if the patient has at least stable disease, has 
again met laboratory parameters as defined in the eligibility section ( Section 3.2.5 ) 
and has not met one of the Off Protocol Therapy or Off Study Criteria 
(Section 8.0). Patients who have experienced dose- limiting toxicity (DLT) ( see 
  THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY  ADVL1522 
28 
Version Date: 07/ 09/18 
Section 5.0 ) in the previous cycle should have the dose modified (see 
Section 4.1.4). Treatment may consist of up to 17 cycles, for a total duration of 
therapy approximating 12 months, absent disease progression  or unacceptable 
toxicity. To continue on therapy the patient must have at least clinically and 
radiographically stable disease. Radiographic disease evaluations will be done 
after the 2nd cycle of therapy, after every other cycle until 6  months, and then every 
3 months. 
 
4.1.4 Dose Schema:  
The starting dose will be 110 mg/m2 (dose level 1). For patients with toxicities as 
outlined in Section 5.0  and who recover to starting criteria within 7  days as 
outlined in Section 4.1.3 , a single dose reduction to the next lowest dose level will 
be allowed.

Further dose reduction for toxicity will be considered if dose level -1 is not 
tolerated. No dose escalations will occur.  
 
4.1.5 Concomitant Therapy  
1. No other anti-cancer agents may be used while on protocol therapy. 
 
2. No other investigational agents may be used while on protocol therapy.

micron filter.  
 
Administer at a rate of 0.02 mg/kg/min (maximum 1 mg/min ) for the first 15 minutes. Provided the 
patient tolerates this rate, the rate can be increased to 0.06 mg/kg/min (maximum 3 mg/min ). If the 
patient tolerates Cycle 1 Day 1 infusion, all subsequent infusions may be delivered at the 
0.06 mg/kg/min (maximum  3 mg/min ) rate. The administration of the study drug is approximately 
1-1.5 hours in duration and will vary slightly depending on the dose. The table below provides 
examples of i nfusion rate calculation s. 
 If an infusional reaction occurs, the infusion should be stopped and supportive care given as per institutional guidelines. Anaphylactic precautions should be observed during IMGN901 
administration. Patients should be monitored for at least 1 hour after completion of the infusion.  
See Section 5.4.4
 for management and dose modification guidelines for infusional reactions. 
 
Drug doses should be adjusted based on the BSA calculated from height and weight measured within 7 days prior to the beginning of each cycle.   
 Note: Pretreatment use of acetaminophen and/or diphenhydramine may be considered as per 
Investigator’s routine practice. If provided, it is recommended that these agents be administered 30 to 60 minutes prior to  the start of the IMGN901 infusion.

5.0 DEFINITIONS AND DOSE MODIFICATIONS FOR TOXICITY 
 
5.1 Dose Modifications for Day 8 Dosing due to Toxicity on Day 8 
 
5.1.1 Hematological Toxicity (All Age Cohorts) 
Patients who have Grade 4 neutropenia or platelets < 75,000/µL on Day 8 will 
have their IMGN901 dose (and D ay 7 and 8 dexamethasone doses if not yet given) 
withheld. If the toxicity resolves to ANC ≥ 750/µL and platelets ≥ 75,000/µL 
(transfusion independent) by Day 11, the dose may be given with appropriately 
timed dexamethasone support as is feasible  and future doses should not be reduced . 
If the toxicity does not resolve to ANC ≥ 750/µL and platelets ≥ 75,000/µL by Day 11, the dose will be omitted and this will be considered a DLT. Patients should 
receive subsequent cycles of drug but at the next lower dose level. Patients who require that their Day 8 dose be omitted for Grade 4 neutropeni a or platelets 
< 75,000/ µL after an initial dose reduction should have all future Day 8 doses 
omitted. 
 
Patients who  meet hematological DLT criteria as defined in Section 5. 2.2
 on Day 8 
will have their Day 8 dose (and Day 7 and 8 dexamethasone doses if not yet given) 
omitted. Patients should receive subsequent cycles of drug but at the next lower dose level. Patients who require that their Day 8 dose be omitted for hematologic 
DLT as defined in 
Section 5.2.2  after an initial dose reduction should have all 
future Day 8 doses omitted. 
 Patients who require more than 2 dose reductions must be removed from protocol 
therapy. 
 
5.1.2 Non-Hematological Toxicity   
Patients who have Grade 3 or Grade 4 non- hematological toxicity attributable to 
the study drug  prior to the Day 8 dose (with the exception of the DLT exclusions 
in Section 5.2.1.1 ) will be cons idered to have had a DLT. If the toxicity resolves 
to meet eligibility or ≤ Grade 2 (if not part of eligibility criteria) by Day 8, the dose 
(along with dexamethasone support) may be given but at the next lower dose level. 
If the toxicity does not resolve by Day 11, the dose (along with dexamethasone 
support) will be omitted. Patients should receive subsequent cycles of drug but 
with dose modifications according to Section 5. 4. 
 Patients who require more than 2 dose reductions must be removed from  protocol 
therapy. 
 
All dose modifications should be based on the worst preceding toxicity. 
 
5.2 Definition of Dose -Limiting Toxicity (DLT)  
DLT will be defined as any of the following events that are at least possibly, probably or 
definitely attributable to IMGN901. Dose -limiting hematological and non -hematological 
toxicities are defined differently.   
 
                              THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY            ADVL1522 
38 
Version Date: 07/ 09/18 
5.2.1 Non-Hematological Dose -Limiting Toxicity  
 
5.2.1.1 Any Grade 3 or higher non-hematological toxicity attributable to the 
investigational drug with the specific exclusion of:  
 
• Grade 3 nausea and vomiting 
• Grade 3 ALT/AST elevation that returns to Grade ≤ 1 or baseline prior 
to the time for the next treatment cycle. Note:  For the purposes of this 
trial the ULN for ALT is defined as 45 U/L.  
• Grade 3 fever or infection  
• Grade 3 hypophosphatemia, hypokalemia, hypocalcemia and/or 
hypomagnesemia responsive to oral supplementation. 
• Peripheral neuropathy Grade 3 for ≤ 7 days 
 
5.2.1.2 Non-hematological toxicity that causes a delay of ≥ 14 days between 
treatment cycles.  
 5.2.1.3 Grade 2 allergic reactions that necessitate discontinuation of study drug 
will not be considered a dose -limiting toxicity.  
 
5.2.2 Hematological Dose- Limiting Toxicity 
 
5.2.2.1 Definition of a Hematological Dose- Limiting Toxicity for Patients 
without Bone Marrow Involvement at Enrollment  
 
• Grade 3 thrombocy topenia occurring in conjunction with Grade  3 
bleeding (CTCAE te rms hemorrhage or epistaxis)  
• Grade 4 neutropenia for > 7 days  
• Platelet count < 20,000/µL on 2 separate days, or requiring a platelet 
transfusion on 2 separate days, within a 7 day period  
• Myelosuppression that causes a delay of ≥ 14 days between treatment 
cycles 
• Any Grade  5 hematological toxicity .  
 
5.3 Dose Modifications for Hematological Toxicity  
 
5.3.1 Patients who have dose- limiting thrombocytopenia should receive subsequent 
cycles at the next lower dose level. Patients who require that their Day 8 dose be 
omitted for platelets <  75,000 µL after an initial dose reduction should have all 
future Day 8 doses omitted.  
 
5.3.2 Patients who have dose- limiting neutropenia (Grade 4 neutropenia of > 7 days 
duration or delay in the start of the next cycle for > 14 days due to neutropenia) with no other dose -limiting toxicity should receive the same dose in the next cycle 
with myeloid growth factor support administered the next day after the Day 8 dose of IMGN901 is given. [Note: Patients MUST NOT receive prophylactic myeloid 
growth factor in  the first cycle of therapy.] If dose -limiting neutropenia recurs after 
myeloid growth factor is added, then the patient should be given the next lower dose level followed by myeloid growth factor support beginning the next day after 
                              THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY            ADVL1522 
39 
Version Date: 07/ 09/18 
the Day 8 dose of IMGN 901 is given for subsequent cycles. Patients who 
experience dose- limiting neutropenia after the addition of myeloid growth factor 
and one dose reduction must have all future Day 8 doses omitted.  
 
5.3.3 Patients who experience dose -limiting hematological toxicity after a single dose 
reduction (and the addition of myeloid growth factor if the DLT is neutropenia) 
must have all future Day 8 doses omitted.  
 
5.3.4 Patients who experience dose -limiting hematological toxicity in cycles after Day 8 
doses were requi red to be omitted as above must be removed from protocol 
therapy. 
 
5.4 Dose Modifications for Non -Hematological Toxicity  
 
5.4.1 Patients who have any dose- limiting non hematological toxicity (as defined in 
Section 5.2.1 ) that returns to eligibility lab requirements within 14 days after the 
planned start of the next treatment cycle may continue on study but should receive 
subsequent doses at the next lower dose level. Peripheral neuropathy must resolve  
to Grade 2 or lower following Grade 3 or 4 peripheral neuropathy prior to 
resumption of therapy, but it does not need to resolve to eligibility criteria. 
 
5.4.2 If non-hematological dose -limiting toxicity recurs at the reduced dose, the patient 
must have all future Day 8 doses omitted. 
 
5.4.3 Patients who experience dose -limiting non-hematological toxicity in cycles after 
Day 8 doses were required to be omitted as above must be removed from protocol 
therapy.

Version Date: 07/ 09/18 
 
5.4.4 For patients who have allergic or acute infusional reactions to IMGN901 therapy 
modifications based on grade should be as follows:  
Infusion 
reactions and 
delayed 
infusion-related 
reactions  Any potential infusion reaction should be classified based upon 
severity and time of onset relative to the infusion and reported as an 
infusion reaction and the underlying symptoms on the AE CRF. 
Mild or moderate 
(Grade 1-2) • Grade 1: Slow infusion rate by 50% and 
monitor patient for worsening of condition. 
Future infusions should be given at the 50%  
rate. 
 
• Grade 2: Stop infusion; symptom control as 
per institutional guidelines  (e.g., narcotics, 
IV fluids) . Give diphenhydramine 0.5-
1 mg/kg (max 50 mg IV) and may consider 
additional hydrocortisone 1 -2 mg/kg (max 
250 mg IV) or dexamethasone 4 mg/m2 
(max 10 mg IV or PO).  Resume infusion at 
50% of the prior rate once the reaction has 
decreased to ≤ Grade 1. Monitor patient for 
worsening co ndition. Discontinue 
IMGN901 treatment if condition worsens. 
For subsequent doses, add diphenhydramine 
0.5-1 mg/kg (max 50 mg IV) to the 
premedication regimen and infuse at 50% 
rate. 
Severe or life-
threatening:  
(Grade 3-4) • Grade 3: Stop infusion immediately and 
disconnect the infusion tubing. Administer 
bronchodilators for bronchospasms, and 
other medications (e .g., epinephrine, 
Normal Saline) as medically indicated. 
Hospital admission should be considered. 
For subsequent doses, add 
diphenhydramine 0.5-1 mg/kg (max 50 mg 
IV) to the premedication regimen and 
infuse at 50% rate.  
• Grade 4: Discontinue IMGN901. Treat per 
institutional guidelines.  
*NOTE: I nfusional reactions usually occur during or within 
24 hours of the drug adm inistration. If infusional reactions are 
suspected more than 24 hours after the dosing of IMGN901, the 
patients should be treated as per institutional guidelines and the 
study chair should be notified.

7.2 Correlative Biology Studies  
 
7.2.1 Pharmacokinetics  
 
Currently PK is optional for all patients.  
 
Pharmacokinetics  was required for the first 6 patients enrolled at COG Consortium 
(Phase 1) sites. 
 
 
7.2.1.1 Description of Studies and Assay  
Peripheral blood samples will be collected for the purpose of determining 1) IMGN901 conjugate, 2) total antibody which measures 
the concentration of both free huN901 antibody and conjugated antibody, 3) free DM1 maytansinoid, and 4) immunogenicity (ADA). Concentrations of IMGN901 conjugate, total antibody, and ADA will 
be measured using validated ELISA assays. Free DM1 maytansinoid  
will be measured using a validated LC/MS/MS assay.  
 
7.2.1.2 Sample Collection and Schedule   Timing of protocol therapy administration, response assessment studies, and surgical interventions are 
based on schedules derived from the  experimental design or on established standards of care. Minor 
unavoidable departures (up to 72 hours) from protocol directed therapy and/or disease evaluations (and 
up to 1 week for surgery) for valid clinical, patient and f amily logistical, or facility,  procedure and/or 
anesthesia scheduling issues are acceptable per COG administrative Policy 5.14 (except where 
explicitly prohibited within the protocol). This policy does NOT apply to eligibility requirements; but 
to therapy and evaluations post consent a nd post the start of protocol directed care.  
                              THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY            ADVL1522 
49 
Version Date: 07/ 09/18 
Peripheral blood samples for IMGN901 conjugate, total antibody, and 
ADA measurements will be collected in red top vacutainer tubes. Blood 
samples for free DM1 mayt ansinoid will be collected in vacutainer tubes 
containing heparin (green top) or EDTA (lavender top) and chemical additives to maintain DM1 ma ytansinoid stability. All samples should 
be drawn from a site distant from the infusion. The exact time that the 
sample is drawn along with the exact time that the drug is administered 
is to be recorded on the Pharmacokinetic Transmittal f orm in Rave.  
 
Peripheral blood samples will be collected at the following time points during Cycle 1:  
 
o Day 1: Pretreatment, end of infusion, and 2 hrs, 6 hrs, 24 hrs, and 
72-120 hrs after the end of the infusion . 
 
o Day 8: Pretreatment, end of infusion, and 2 hrs and 6 hrs after the 
end of the infusion . 
 
7.2.1.3 Sample Processing  
IMGN901 conjugate, total antibody, a nd ADA: 
a. Draw 3 m L of blood in red top or tiger top vacuum tube (no 
anticoagulant) at each indicated time point. 
b. Allow the tubes to remain at room temperature for 30 to 
60 minutes to clot.  
c. Centrifuge tubes at 1500 RPM for 15 minutes at room temperature.

7.2.2 Peripheral Blood Cells CD56 
 
Peripheral blood cells CD56 count analyses will be performed for all  patients 
participating in the optiona l pharmacokinetic  studies.  
 
7.2.2.1 Summary of CD56 absolute count in whole blood:  
CD56-positive cells in peripheral blood will be measured using a 
MiltenyiMACSQuant 10 flow cytometer (MiltenyiBiotec) and a lyse-no-wash staining technique. The MACSQuant Instrument employs a 
volumetric sample uptake system, which allows for direct determi nation 
of an absolute cell count of the sample. Fifty microliters ( µL) of EDTA 
blood will be labeled with 10 µL of anti -CD56 APC  and 15 µL of anti-
CD45 FITC antibodies (BD  Biosciences). The addition of CD45, a pan-
leukocyte marker, allows for separation of  debris and red blood cells 
from the leukocytes, and makes gating on the lymphocyte population more accurate. The blood is incubated with the antibodies and lysed with 
925 µL of FACSLyse red blood cell lysis solution.  The sample is then 
analyzed on the MACSQuant flow cytometer using a program that yields both the percent of CD56 -positive cells and the absolute number 
of positive cells per milliliter and per microliter.  
 
7.2.2.2 Sample collection and Schedule:  
Peripheral b lood samples are collected in an EDT A tube on Day 1 and 
Day 8 of Cycle 1 prior to (within 12 hours of starting) IMGN901 
administration. Minimum volume 1 mL. All samples should be drawn 
from a site distant from the infusion.

7.2.3 Tumor CD56 Expression (required) 
CD56 expression will be assessed using standard immunohistochemistry . CD56 
antibody, clone 123C3 from Ventana will be used. The procedure will be a fully automated immunohistochemical staining, performed at a Ventana Benchmark 
Ultra staining system and following a protocol clinically validated at Lurie 
Children’s Hospital ( Chicago).  
 Tumor cells will be recorded as either negative or positive. O nly membranous 
expression will be considered. Positive staining will be interpreted qualitatively as 
the presence of coarse granular staining of the cell membrane in a circumferential  
pattern. 
 
Scoring: 0-3+ according to percentage of positive cells (as defined above)  
0-10% positive cells: 0  
10-25% positive cells: 1+ 
25-50% positive cells: 2+ 
> 50% positive cells: 3+ 
 
Controls: 
• 3+ blastemal Wilms tumor as positive control  
• Patient’s tum or sample not treated with CD56 antibody as negative control .

7.3 Central Review  
The pertinent imaging studies (CT, MR I—and MIBG for neuroblastoma patients with 
123I-
MIBG positive lesions at start of therapy ) of those patients who respond to therapy or have 
long term stable disease on protocol therapy will be centrally reviewed. COG Operations Center will notify the Imaging Research Center of any patient requiring central review. 
The Imaging Research Center will then request that the treating institution  forward the 
requested images for central review. The central image evaluation results will be entered

9.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 
9.1 Sample Size and Study Duration  
 
9.1.1 Patient Accrual and Expected Duration of the Study:  
Three disease strata have been identified for reporting upon completion of 
evaluation of the particular disease stratum (‘primary disease groups’). These 
disease strata are: (1) Wilms; (2) rhabdomyosarcoma; and (3) neuroblastoma. The 
evaluation rule is described in Section 9.2  below. 
 
In addition to the three main strata, enrollment into each of the following tumor 
groups (‘secondary strata’): (4) pleuropulmonary blastoma, (5) malignant 
peripheral nerve sheath t umor, and (6) synovial sarcoma; will be open to accrual.  
 When the evaluation of the three primary disease groups is complete, enrollment 
to the study will be terminated unless the DVL committee leadership indicates 
further enrollment on the secondary str ata is warranted.  
 If two of the three primary disease strata (Wilms, rhabdomyosarcoma, and 
neuroblastoma) have met their accrual and one remains open, the Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP) and the ADVL1522 Investigators will discuss the study timel ine. 
 Based on the enrollment rates prior to activation of Amendment #1, the following 
entry rates for the various tumors under study can be expected: 
 
Disease Group/Strata   Patients/Year  
1) Wilms tumor    18 
2) Rhabdomyosarcoma     14 
3) Neuroblastoma    9 
 
For Wilms: 10 patients enrolled prior to activation of Amendment #1. Accrual of 
an additional 6 patients is expected to take approximately 4 months.  
For rhabdomyosarcoma: 8 patients enrolled prior to activation of Amendment #1. 
Accrual of an additional 8 patients is expected to take approximately 7 months.  
 
For neuroblastoma:5 patents enrolled prior to activation of Amendment #1. 
Accrual of an additional 11 patients is expected to take approximately 14.5 months.  
 Allowing for roughly a 15% rate of inel igible/inevaluable patients, each stratum 
could need to enroll up to 19  patients to allow for 16 evaluable patients.  
 
The study will likely require 2 to 3 years for sufficient patient enrollments to 
evaluate IMGN901 in the three primary disease groups. If activity is detected in any category, further trials in subcategories of that category may be conducted at the discretion of the Developmental Therapeutics Steering and study committees. 
A maximum of 1 14 patients is anticipated. 
 
9.2 Definition of Recommen ded Phase  2 Dose (RP2D)/ Tolerable Dose  
The initial MTD defined in the adult trial is 112 mg/m
2/dose, approximated herein as dose 
                              THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY            ADVL1522 
55 
Version Date: 07/ 09/18 
level 1 at 110 mg/m2/dose. If there are < 2 DLTs in the first 6 patients treated at dose level  1 
during the first cycle of therapy, this will be considered the RP2D and all subsequent 
patients will be enrolled at this dose level. If the MTD has been exceeded at Dose Level  1 
as noted from the first six patients enrolled (≥ 2 DLTs at least possibly attributed to 
IMGN901), then t he subsequent patients will be treated at Dose Level -1. If there are 
<2 DLTs in the first 6 patients treated at dose level -1, this will be considered the RP2D 
and all subsequent patients will be enrolled at this dose level. A dose level -2 has been 
included in the proposal for purposes of providing a dose for those patients potentially 
accrued at dose level -1 (in the event it becomes the RP2D) and then subsequently requiring 
a dose reduction due to toxicity. 
 Delayed Toxicity Monitoring: We will monitor all serious adverse events on an ongoing basis. 
Analyses will be incorporated to screen for excess delayed peripheral neuropathy specifically.   
 
A patient will be considered for toxicity monitoring if the patient is eligible and one of the 
following occurs: (1) completes one cycle of protocol therapy; (2) dies on protocol therapy 
for a reason considered possibly, probably, or likely related to protocol therapy; or (3) is 
removed from protocol therapy because of an adverse experience possibly, probably, or likely related to one of the agents. A toxicity -evaluable patient will be considered in the 
analysis during the interval from study enrollment until protocol therapy is terminated or, a toxicity -event is observed, whichever occurs first. A toxicity -evaluable patient will be 
considered to have experienced an excessive toxicity event if: (1) the patient dies on protocol therapy for a reason considered possibly, probably, or likely related to protocol therapy; or (2) experiences a dose- limiting toxicity.  
 The analytic unit for monitoring for excessive toxicity will be the patient- cycle: Each cycle 
where an excessive toxicity event is observed or where the patient receives the agent and 
completes the full cycle of treatment will be considered in the analysis. If  there is 
overwhelming evidence that the dose selected for this trial has a per -cycle-excessive 
peripheral neuropathy (Grade 3 or higher) probability of more than 1/3, such information will be presented to the DSMB and consideration will be given to modify ing any defined 
RP2D to one dose level lower.  
 We will use a Bayesian rule to monitor for excessive peripheral neuropathy.
32,33 We will 
assume a beta prior distribution with α = 0.6 and β = 1.2. At least once per month, we will calculate the posterior probability (given the data) that the probability of Grade 3 or higher 
peripheral neuropathy (“Excessive PN”) exceeds the 1/3 threshold:  
 
𝑃𝑃(𝑝𝑝Excessive  PN> 1/3 | Data) =��𝑛𝑛
𝑥𝑥�𝑝𝑝𝑥𝑥(1−𝑝𝑝)𝑛𝑛−𝑥𝑥Γ(1.8)

1/3 
 
where n is the number of excessive- PN-evaluable cycles and x is the number of such cycles 
on which an excessive PN event is observed.  If this posterior probability exceeds 80%, 
such information will be presented to the DSMB and consideration will be given to 
modifying any defined RP2D to one dose level lower. Examples of situations in which this 
rule will indicate excessive toxicity have been noted and are presented below:

9.3 Study Design  
This trial is a multi- strata Phase 2 study of IMGN901. The primary endpoint will be 
objective response by RECIST criteria.  As of Amendment #1, each stratum will accrue a 
maximum of 16 evaluable patients. IMGN901 will be identified as having sufficient 
activity for further study in a particular stratum if there are at least 4 responses (PR or CR) 
confirmed by central review. This design will be used for all strata which have not been 
closed prior to the activation of Amendment #1. 
 
We will consider the agent not of sufficient interest for fur ther evaluation in a disease 
category if the true response rate is 15%. (H 0 is a true response rate of 15%.) H a is a true 
response rate of 40%. Each stratum will accrue 16 evaluable patients. Thus, there will be a 
maximum of 96 evaluable patients. If the agent has a true response rate of 15%, the rule 
described herein will identify the agent of sufficient activity for further study with probability 0.079 (T ype I error). If the agent has a true response rate of 40%, the rule 
described herein will identify t he agent of sufficient activity for further study with 
probability 0.833 (power against the alternative hypothesis p = 0.40). In addition to making 
the decision to accept or reject the drug, the final results will be reported after all patients 
have been i dentified as having a CR, PR, or PD as their response according to protocol -
specified criteria.  
 
Prior to Amendment #1, the trial  used a Simon two- stage optimal design in each stratum . 
The best response of disease w as examined separately in each stratum. Within each 
stratum, the following two- stage design for 15% response rate vs. 40% response rate with 
α = β = 0.10 w as employed: 
 
 Cumulative Number of Responses 
at the End of the Stage  Decision 
Stage 1:  
Enter 10 evaluable 
patients  0 or 1 
 
2 or more  Terminate the trial for this stratum 
because the agent is ineffective. 
Proceed to Stage 2. 
Stage 2:  
Enter 12 additional evaluable patients  5 or fewer  
 
6 or more Terminate the trial for this stratum 
because the agent is ineffective. 
Terminate the trial fo r this stratum 
because the agent is effective .

9.4 Methods of Analysis  
Response criteria are described in Section 10.0 . A responder is defined as a patient who 
achieves a best response (as defined in Section 10.6) of PR or CR on the study. Response 
rates will be calculated as the percent of evaluable patients who are responders, and 
Clopper-Pearson confidence intervals will be constructed.  
 Toxicity tables will be constructed to summarize the observed incidence by  type of toxicity 
and grade. A patient will be counted only once per cycle for a given toxicity for the worst 
grade of that toxicity reported for that patient. Toxicity information recorded will include the type, severity, time of onset, time of resolution , and the probable association with the 
study regimen.  
 
9.5 Evaluability for Response  
Any eligible patient who receives at least one dose of IMGN901 will be considered 
evaluable for response with the following exception : if a patient receives non -protocol anti-
cancer therapy (including surgery) during the response evaluation period after the patient is considered as having a partial or complete response but prior to confirmation of this 
status by tumor imaging and before progressive disease is noted, the i ndividual will be 
considered inevaluable for the response endpoint . Further,  patients who stop IMGN901 
after the first evaluation because of toxicities or death will be considered evaluable for the response evaluation and will be counted as non- responders for the response endpoint . 
Patients who demonstrate a complete or partial response confirmed by central review will be considered to have experienced a response for the application of the rule given in 
Section 
9.2. The evaluation period for determination of the best response will be 6 treatment cycles. 
All other patients will be considered non- responders. All patients considered to have a 
response (CR or PR) must have imaging studies reviewed centrally at the COG. Cente rs 
will be notified by the COG about requests for scans of patients with stable disease. See 
Section 7.3  regarding shipping instructions. Preliminary assessment of activity using 
institutionally provided tumor measurements will be entered into CDUS quarterly. The central review by COG will be provided as the final reviewed assessment of response when such becomes available.  
                              THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY            ADVL1522

Version Date: 07/ 09/18 
 
9.6 Evaluability for Toxicity  
All patients who receive at least one dose of IMGN901 according to protocol guidelines 
and either 1) experience a toxicity, or 2) complete the first cycle with no toxicity, will be 
considered in the evaluation of toxicity. 
 
 
9.7 Gender and Minority Accrual  Estimates  
The gender and minority distribution of the study population is expected to be:  
 
Racial category Ethnicity 
Total Not Hispanic 
or Latino Hispanic or

This distribution was derived from the demographic data for patients enrolled on recent COG 
Phase 2 trials ADVL0821 and ADVL0921 with diagnoses among the primary disease groups . 
 
9.8 Analysis of the Pharmacokinetic Parameters  
A descriptive analysis of pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of IMGN901 will be performed 
to define systemic exposure, drug clearance, and other pharmacokinetic parameters. The 
PK parameters will be summarized with simple summary statistics, including means, 
medians, ranges, and standard deviations (if numbers and distribution permit).  
 
9.9 Analysis of Biological and Correlative Endpoints  
CD56 Expression 
The association between CD56+ expression and response will be evaluated using the exact 
conditional test of proportions (Fisher’s Exact Test). 
 
Pharmacokinetics  
A descriptive analysis of pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of IMGN901 will be performed 
to define systemic exposure, drug clearance, and other pharmacokinetic parameters. The 
PK parameters will be summarized with simple summary statistics, including means, 
medians, ranges, and standard deviations (if numbers and distribution permit).  
 
All these analyses will  be descriptive and exploratory and hypotheses generating in nature.

10.0 EVALUATION CRITERIA 
 
10.1 Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) 
This study will utilize the CTCAE of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) for toxicity and 
performance reporting. The descriptions and grading scales found in the revised CTCAE 
version 4.0 will be utilized for reporting. All appropriate treatment areas should have access 
to a copy of the CTCAE version 4.0, which can be downloaded from the CTEP w eb site 
(http://ctep.cancer.gov /protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm ). 
Additionally, toxicities are to be reported on the appropriate case report forms. 
 
10.2 Response Criteria  
As outlined, patients wi ll be assigned to one of the following categories for assessment of 
response: a) solid tumor and measurable disease ( Section 10. 3); b) neuroblastoma with MIBG 
positive lesions ( Section 10. 4); c) neuroblastoma with bone marrow involvement ( Section 
10.5); Note: Neuroblastoma patients who do not have MIBG positive lesions or bone marrow 
involvement should be assessed for response as solid tumor patients with measurable or evaluable disease.  
 
10.3 Response Criteria for Patients with Solid Tumors (non -CNS) 
Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the revised Response 
Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) guideline (version 1.1 .) 34 Key points are 
that 5 target lesions are identified and that changes in the largest diameter (unidimensional 
measurement)  of the tumor lesions are used in the RECIST v 1.1 criteria. 
 
10.3.1 Measurable Disease  
The presence of at least one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one 
dimension with the longest diameter at least 10 mm (CT scan slice thickness no 
greater than 5 mm) . The investigator will identify up to 5 measurable lesions to be 
followed for response.  Previously irradiated lesions must demonstrate clear 
evidence of progression to be considered measurable.  
 Serial measurements of lesions are to be done with appropriate imaging modalities, 
e.g., CT or MRI. Bone scans cannot be used to measure lesions. The same method of assessment is to be used to characterize each identified and reported lesion at 
baseline and during follow-up.
 
 
10.3.2 Quantification of Disease Burden  
The sum of the longest diameter (LD) for all target lesions will be calculated and 
reported as the disease measurement.  
 
10.3.3 End-of-Cycle Response  
Note: Please also see Table 1 in Section 10.6 . 
 
a) Complete Response (CR)   
Disappearance of all target and non -target lesions. Normalization of urinary 
catecholamines (for patients with neuroblastoma), immunocytologic findings, 
or other tumor markers if abnormal or elevated at study enrollment.  
 
                              THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY            ADVL1522 
60 
Version Date: 07/ 09/18 
b) Partial Response (PR)  
At least a 30% decrease in the disease measurement, taking as reference the 
disease measurement done to confirm measurable disease at study enrollment. 
No new lesions or progression of any non- target measurable lesion.  
 
c) Stable Disease (S D) 
Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify 
for PD taking as reference the smallest disease measurement since the 
treatment started.  
 
d) Progressive Disease (PD)   
At least a 20% increase in the sum of the disease measurements for measurable 
lesions, taking as reference the smallest disease measurement recorded since 
the start of treatment, or the appearance of one or more new lesions.  
 
 
10.3.4 Overall Best Response Assessment   
Each patient will be classified according to their “best response” for the purposes 
of analysis of treatment effect. Best response is determined from the sequence of 
the objective statuses described in Section 10.6  (Tables 1-3). 
  
10.4 Response Criteria for Neuroblastoma Patients with 123I-MIBG Positive Lesions  
10.4.1  MIBG Positive Lesions  
Patients who have a positive MIBG scan at the start of therapy will be evaluable for MIBG response. The use of 
123I for MIBG imaging is recommended for all scans. If 
this isotope is unavailable at the treating institution, the use of the same radioisotope 
for all MIBG scans for an individual patient is strongly encouraged.  
 
10.4.2 The following criteria will be used to report MIBG response by the treat ing 
institution : 
• Complete Response:  Complete resolution of all MIBG positive lesions 
• Partial Response:  Resolution of at least one MIBG positive lesion, with 
persistence of other MIBG positive lesions.  
• Stable Disease:  No change in MIBG scan in number of positive lesions (includes 
patients who have same number of positive lesions but decreased density).  
• Progressive Disease:  Development of new MIBG positive lesions. 
 
10.4.3 The response of MIBG lesions will be assessed on central review using the Curie 
scale as outlined below. Central review responses will be used to assess efficacy for study endpoint. See 
Section 7.3  for details on transferring images to the 
Imaging Research Center. 
 
NOTE: This scoring is NOT required to be done by the treating institution for end 
of course response assessments.  
 
The body is divided into 9 anatomic sectors for osteomedullary lesions, with a 10th 
general sector allocated for any extra -osseous lesion visible on MIBG scan . In each 
region, the lesions are scored as follows. The absolute extension score is graded as:  
0 = no site per segment,  
1 = 1 site per segment,  
2 = more than one site per segment,  
3 = massive involvement (>50% of the segment).  
                              THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY            ADVL1522 
61 
Version Date: 07/ 09/18 
 
The absolute score is obtained by adding the score of all the segments. See 
diagram of sectors below:  
 
The relative score is calculated by dividing the absolute score at each time point 
by the corresponding pre -treatment absolute score. The relative score of each 
patient is calculated at each response assessment compared to baseline and 
classified as below:  
1. Complete response: all areas of uptake on MIBG scan completely resolved. 
If morphological evidence of tumor cells in bone marrow biopsy or aspiration is present at enrollment, no tumor cells can be detected by routine morphology 
on two subsequent bilateral bone marrow aspirates and biopsies done at least 3 weeks apart to be considered a Complete Response . 
2. Partial response : Relative score ≤ 0.2 (lesions  almost disappeared) to ≤ 0.5 
(lesions strongly reduced). 
3. Stable disease : Relative score > 0.5 (lesions weakly but significantly reduced) 
to 1.0 (lesions not reduced).  
4. Progressive disease : New lesions on MIBG scan   
 
10.4.4 Overall Best Response Assessment  
Each patient will be classified according to their “best response” for the purposes 
of analysis of treatment effect. Best response is determined from the sequence of 
the objective statutes described in Table 3 in Section 10.6 . 
 
10.4.5 Response Criteria for Patients Enrolled with Evaluable Disease on Bone Scan  
Patients who have a positive bone scan at the start of therapy will be evaluable for 
bone scan response. NOTE: Bone Scans are not required imaging tests on this 
study. However, if a bone scan is performed at baseline and on subsequent 
evaluations, the f ollowing criteria will be used f or assessment of response.  
 
Bone scan response is defined as:  
• Complete Response (CR): all areas of uptake on bone scan are 
completely resolved and no new lesions have occurred.  
• Progressive Disease (PD): new lesions on bone scan. 
• Non-CR, Non-PD: neither complete response, nor progressive disease. 

                              THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY            ADVL1522

Version Date: 07/ 09/18 
 
10.5 Response Criteria for Neuroblastoma Patients with Bone Marrow Involvement  
 
10.5.1 Bone Marrow Involvement   
Note: patients with bone marrow as the ONLY site of disease are not eligible for 
this study. Response criteria in this section are intended to be used when assessing 
marrow involvement as a component of overall response.  
Histologic analysis at the local institution of marrow tumor cell involvement is 
required for patients with a history of marrow involvement. Marrow aspirate and 
biopsy should be evaluated at baseline and every 2 cycles thereafter. Note: If progressive disease is documented by RECIST criteria using tumor measurements or by MIBG scan, then a repeat BM is not needed to confirm PD. 
 
 Complete Response: No tumor cells detectable by routine morphology on 
2 consecutive bilateral bone marrow aspirates and biopsies performed at least 
3 weeks apart. Normalization of urinary catecholamines or other tumor 
markers if elevated at study enrollment.  
 Progressive Disease :  
o Patients who enroll with neuroblastoma in bone marrow by morphology 
have progressive disease if there is a doubling in the amount of tumor in 
the marrow AND a minimum of 25% tumor in bone marrow by 
morphology. (For example, a patient entering with 5% tumor  in marrow 
by morphology must increase to ≥ 25% tumor to have progressive disease; a patient entering with 30% tumor must increase to > 60%). 
o Patients who enroll without evidence of neuroblastoma in bone marrow 
will be defined as progressive disease if tum or is detected in 2 consecutive 
bone marrow biopsies or aspirations done at least 3 weeks apart or the treating physician determines that a single positive bone marrow 
indicates clinical progression of disease.   
 Stable Disease:  Persistence of tumor in bone marrow that does not meet the 
criteria for either complete response or progressive disease.  
 
10.5.2 Overall Best Response Assessment  
Each patient will be classified according to their “best response” for the purposes 
of analysis of treatment effect. Best response is determined from the sequence of 
the objective statutes described in Section 10.6 . 
 
10.6 Best Response (Solid Tumors)  
Two objective status determinations of disease status, by CT or MRI, obtained on two 
consecutive determinations, separated by at least a 3 week time period, are required to 
determine the patient’s overall best response. Two objective status determinations of CR before progression are required for best response of CR. Two determinations of PR or

qualifying as CR or PR, are required for a best r esponse of stable/no response; if the first 
objective status is unknown, only one such determination is required. Patients with an 
objective status of progression on or before the second evaluations (the first evaluation is 
the first radiographic evaluatio n after treatment has been administered) will have a best 
response of progressive disease. Best response is unknown if the patient does not qualify

11.0 ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING REQUIREMENTS  
11.1 Purpose 
Adverse event data collection and reporting, which are required as part of every clinical 
trial, are done to ensure the safety of patients enrolled in the studies as well as those who 
will enroll in future studies using similar agents. Certain adverse events must be reported in an expedited manner to allow for timelier monitoring of patient safety and care. The following sections provide information about expedited reporting.  
 
11.2 Determination of reporting requirements  
Reporting requirements may include the following considerations: 1) whether the patient has received an investigational or commercial agent; 2) the characteristics of the adverse 
event including the grade (severity), the relationship to the study therapy  (attribution), and 
the prior experience (expectedness) of the adverse event; 3) the Phase (1, 2, or 3) of the 
trial; and 4) whether or not hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization was associated 
with the event.  
 
An investigational agent is a protocol drug administered under an Invest igational New 
Drug Application (IND). In some instances, the investigational agent may be available 
commercially, but is actually being tested for indications not included in the approved 
package label.  
 
Commercial agents are those agents not provided under an IND but obtained instead from 
a commercial source. The NCI, rather than a commercial distributor, may on some 
occasions distribute commercial agents for a trial.  
 
When a study includes both investigational and commercial agents, the following rules 
apply:  
• Concurrent administration : When an investigational agent is used in 
combination with a commercial agent, the combination is considered to be investigational and expedited reporting of adverse events would follow the guidelines for investigational agents.  
• Sequential administration: When a study includes an investigational agent 
and a commercial agent on the same study arm, but the commercial agent is 
given for a period of time prior to starting the investigational agent, 
expedited reporting of adverse events that occur prior to starting the 
investigational agent would follow the guidelines for commercial  agents. 
Once therapy with the investigational agent is initiated, all expedited 
reporting of adverse events follow the investigational agent reporting guidelines. 
 
11.3 Expedited Reporting Requirements – Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)  
To ensure compliance with these regulations/this guidance, as IND/IDE sponsor, NCI requires that AEs be submitted according to the timeframes in the AE reporting tables assigned to the protocol, using the CTEP Adverse Event Reporting System (CTEP -
AERSCTEP- AERS). 
 
Any AE that is serious qualifies for expedited reporting . An AE is defined as any 
untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether or  not 
considered drug related. A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is any adverse drug event 
(experience) occurring at any dose that results in ANY of the following outcomes: 
 
                              THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY            ADVL1522 
65 
Version Date: 07/ 09/18 
1) Death. 
2) A life-threatening adverse drug experience.  
3) An adverse event resulting in inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing 
hospitalization (for ≥ 24 hours). This does not include hospitalizations that are part 
of routine medical practice.  
4) A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to 
conduct normal life functions. 
5) A congenital anomaly/birth defect. 
6) Important Medical Events (IME) that may not result in death, be life threatening, 
or require hospitalization may be considered a serious adverse drug experience 
when, based upon medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes 
listed in this definition.  
 
11.4 Specific Examples for Expedited Reporting  
 
11.4.1 SAEs Occurring More than 30 Days A fter Last Dose of Study Drug 
Any Serious Adverse Event that occurs more than 30 days after the last administration of the investigational agent/intervention and has an attribution of a 
possible, probable, or definite relationship to the study therapy must be reported 
according to the CTEP- AERS reporting tables in this protocol.  
 
11.4.2 Persistent or Significant Disabilities/Incapacities  
Any AE that results in persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions (formerly referred to as disabilities), 
congenital anomalies or birth defects, must be reported via CTEP -AERS if it 
occurs at any time following tr eatment with an agent under a NCI, COG, or 
industry sponsor IND/IDE since these are considered to be serious AEs.  
 
11.4.3 Death 
 
Reportable Categories of Death  
o Death attributable to a CTCAE term.  
o Death Neonatal: A disorder characterized by cessation of life during the first 
28 days of life.  
o Sudden Death NOS: A sudden (defined as instant or within one hour of the onset of symptoms) or an unobserved cessation of life that cannot be attributed 
to a CTCAE term associated with Grade 5.  
o Death NOS: A cessation of life that cannot be attributed to a CTCAE term 
associated with grade 5.  
o Death due to progressive disease should be reported as Grade 5 “Disease 
progression” under the system organ class (SOC) of “General disorder and 
administration site conditions” . Evidence that the death was a manifestation of 
underlying disease ( e.g., radiological changes suggesting tumor growth or 
progression: clinical deterioration associated with a disease process) should be 
submitted.  
 
Any death occurring within 30 days of the last dose, regardless of attribution to 
the investigational agent/inte rvention requires expedited reporting within 24 hours.  
                              THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY            ADVL1522 
66 
Version Date: 07/ 09/18 
Any death occurring greater than 30 days after the last dose of the investigational 
agent/intervention requires expedited reporting within 24 hours only if it is 
possibly, probably, or definitely rela ted to the investigational agent/intervention.  
 
11.4.4 Secondary Malignancy  
A secondary malignancy is a cancer caused by treatment for a previous 
malignancy (e.g., treatment with investigational agent/intervention, radiation or 
chemotherapy). A metastasis of the initial neoplasm is not considered a secondary 
malignancy.  
 
All secondary malignancies that occur following treatment need to be reported via CTEP-AERS. Three options are available to describe the event:  
• Leukemia secondary to oncology chemotherapy  
• Myelodysplastic syndrome  
• Treatment related secondary malignancy  
Any malignancy possibly related to cancer treatment (including AML/MDS) must 
also be reported via the routine reporting mechanisms outlined in this protocol. 
 
11.4.5 Second Malignancy  
A second malignancy is one unrelated to the treatment of a prior malignancy (and 
is NOT a metastasis from the initial malignancy). Second malignancies requir e 
ONLY routine reporting via CDUS unless otherwise specified.  
11.4.6 Pregnancy, Pregnancy Loss , and Death Neonatal 
NOTE: When submitting CTEP -AERS reports for “Pregnancy”, “Pregnancy loss”, 
or “Neonatal loss”, the Pregnancy Information Form, available at  
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/docs/Pregna
ncyReportForm.pdf , needs to be completed and faxed along with any additional 
medical information to 301-230-0159. The potential risk of exposure of the fetus 
to the investigational agent(s) or chemotherapy agent(s) should be documented in the “Description of Event” section of the CTEP -AERS report.  
 
11.4.6.1 Pregnancy  
Patients who become pregnant on study risk intrauterine exposure of the fetus to agents that may be teratogenic. For this reason, pregnancy  
occurring on study or within 6 months following the last dose of study 
therapy should be reported in an expedited manner via CTEP -AERS as 
Grade 3 “Pregnancy, puerperium and perinatal conditions - Other 
(pregnancy )” under the Pregnancy, puerperium and perinatal 
conditions SOC.  
 
Pregnancy needs to be followed until the outcome is known. If the baby 
is born with a birth defect or anomaly, then a second CTEP -AERS report 
is required. 
 
11.4.6.2 Pregnancy Loss ( Fetal Death ) 
Pregnancy loss is defined in CTCAE as “Death in utero.” 
 
                              THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY            ADVL1522 
67 
Version Date: 07/ 09/18 
Any pregnancy loss should reported expedi tiously as Grade 4 
“Pregnancy loss” under the “Pregnancy, puerperium and perinatal 
condition ” SOC. Do NOT report a pregnancy loss  as a Grade 5 event 
since CTEP -AERS recognizes any Grade 5 event as a patient death.  
 
11.4.6.3 Death Neonatal   
Neonatal death, defined in CTCAE as “Newborn deaths occurring 
during the first 28  after birth ” that is felt by the investigator to be at 
least possibly due to the investigatio nal agent/intervention, should be 
reported expeditiously.  
 A neonatal death should be reported expeditiously  as Grade 4 “Death 
neonatal”  under the “ General disorders and administration” SOC when 
the death is the result  of a patient pregnancy or pregnancy in 
partners of men on study .  
 
Do NOT report a neonatal death resulting from a patient pregnancy or 
pregnancy in partners of men on study as a Grade 5 event since CTEP -
AERS recognizes any Grade 5 event as a patient death.  
 
11.5 Reporting Requirements for Specialized AEs  
 
11.5.1 Baseline AEs 
Although a pertinent positive finding identified on baseline assessment is not an AE, when possible it is to be documented as “Course Zero” using CTCAE 
terminology and grade. An expedited AE report is not required if a patient is 
entered on a protocol with a pre -existing condition ( e.g., elevated laboratory value, 
diarrhea). The baseline AE must be re-assessed throughout the study and reported 
if it fulfills expedited AE reporting guidelines. 
 
a. If the pre -existing condition worsens in severity, the  investigator must 
reassess the event to determine if an expedited report is required.  
b. If the AE resolves and then recurs, the investigator must re- assess the event 
to determine if an expedited report is required. 
c. No modification in grading is to be made to account for abnormalities 
existing at baseline.  
 
11.5.2 Persistent AEs  
A persistent AE is one that extends continuously, without resolution between treatment cycles/courses.  
ROUTINE reporting: The AE must be reported only once unless the grade becomes more severe in a subsequent course. If the grade becomes more severe 
the AE must be reported again with the new grade.  
EXPEDITED reporting: The AE must be reported only once unless the grade becomes more severe in the same or a subsequent course.  
 
11.5.3 Recurrent AEs  
A recurrent AE is one that occurs and resolves during a cycle/course of therapy 
and then reoccurs in a later cycle/course.  
ROUTINE reporting: An AE that resolves and then recurs during a subsequent cycle/course must be reported by the rou tine procedures.  
                              THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY            ADVL1522 
68 
Version Date: 07/ 09/18 
EXPEDITED reporting: An AE that resolves and then recurs during a subsequent 
cycle/course does not require CTEP -AERS reporting unless: 
1) The grade increases OR  
2) Hospitalization is associated with the recurring AE. 
 
11.6 Exceptions to Ex pedited Reporting  
 
11.6.1 Special Situations as Exceptions to Expedited Reporting  
An expedited report may not be required for a specific protocol where an AE is 
listed as expected. The exception or acceptable reporting procedures will be 
specified in the p rotocol. The protocol specific guidelines supersede the NCI 
Adverse Event Reporting Guidelines. These special situations are listed under the 
CTEP-AERS reporting Table A  for this protocol.  
 
11.7 Reporting Requirements - Investigator Responsibility 
Clinical investigators in the treating institutions and ultimately the Study Chair have the primary responsibility for AE identification, documentation, grading, and assignment of 
attribution to the investigational agent/intervention. It is the responsibil ity of the treating 
physician to supply the medical documentation needed to support the expedited AE reports 
in a timely manner.  
 
Note: All expedited AEs (reported via CTEP -AERS) must also be reported via routine 
reporting. Routine reporting is accomplished via the Adverse Event (AE) Case Report 
Form (CRF) within the study database.  
 
11.8 General Instructions for Expedited Reporting via CTEP -AERS  
 
The reporting methods described below are specific for clinical trials evaluating 
agents for which the IND i s held by COG, an investigator, or a pharmaceutical 
company. It is important to note that these procedures differ slightly from those used for reporting AEs for clinical trials for which CTEP holds the IND.  
 
The descriptions and grading scales found in the  NCI Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0 will be utilized for AE reporting and are located on 
the CTEP website at:  
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm . All 
appropriate treatment areas should have access to a copy of the CTCAE.  
 
An expedited AE report must be submitted electronically via CTEP- AERS at:  
https://eapps-ctep.nci.nih.gov/ctepaers  
 
• Expedited AE repo rting timelines are defined as:  
o 24-Hour; 5 Calendar Days - The AE must initially be reported via CTEP -
AERS within 24 hours of learning of the event, followed by a complete 
expedited report within 5 calendar days of the initial 24-hour report. 
o 7 Calenda r Days - A complete expedited report on the AE must be submitted 
within 7 calendar days of the investigator learning of the event.  
 
• Any event that results in a persistent or significant incapacity/substantial disruption of 
the ability to conduct normal life functions, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or is 
an IME, which based upon the medical judgment of the investigator may jeopa rdize 
the patient and require intervention to prevent a serious AE, must be reported via 
CTEP-AERS if the event occurs following investigational agent administration.

12.0 STUDY REPORTING AND MONITORING  
 
The Case Report Forms and the submission schedule are posted on the COG website with each 
protocol under “Data Collection/Specimens”. A submission schedule is included.  
 
12.1 CDUS 
This study will be monitored by the Clinical Data Update System (CDUS). Cumulative CDUS data will be submitted quarterly to CTEP by electronic means. Reports are due 
January 31, April 30, July 31 and October 31. This is not a responsibility of institutions 
participating in this trial.  
 
12.2 Data and Safety Monitoring Committee 
To protect the interests of patients and the scientific integrity for all clinical trial research by the Children’s Oncology Group, the COG Data and Safety Monitoring Comm ittee 
(DSMC) reviews reports of interim analyses of study toxicity and outcomes prepared by 
the study statistician, in conjunction with the study chair’s report. The DSMC may 
recommend the study be modified or terminated based on these analyses.  
 Toxicity monitoring is also the responsibility of the study committee and any unexpected 
frequency of serious events on the trial are to be brought to the attention of the DSMC. The 
study statistician is responsible for the monitoring of the interim results and is  expected to 
request DSMC review of any protocol issues s/he feels require special review. Any COG member may bring specific study concerns to the attention of the DSMC.  
 
The DSMC approves major study modifications proposed by the study committee prior to implementation (e.g., termination, dropping an arm based on toxicity results or other trials 
reported, increasing target sample size, etc.). The DSMC determines whether and to whom 
outcome results may be released prior to the release of study results at the time specified 
in the protocol document. 
 
 
12.3 CRADA/CTA  
NCI/DCTD Standard Language to Be Incorporated into All Protocols Involving Agent(s) Covered by a Clinical Trials Agreement (CTA), a Cooperative Research and 
Development Agreement (CRADA) or a Clinical Supply Agreement, hereinafter referred 
to as Collaborative Agreement:  
 
The agent(s) supplied by CTEP, DCTD, NCI used in this protocol is/are provided to the 
NCI under a Collaborative Agreement (CRADA, CTA, CSA) between the Pharmaceutical Company(i es) (hereinafter referred to as “Collaborator(s)”) and the NCI Division of Cancer 
Treatment and Diagnosis. Therefore, the following obligations/guidelines, in addition to the provisions in the “Intellectual Property Option to Collaborator” 
(http://ctep.cancer.gov/industryCollaborations2/intellectual_property.htm
) contained 
within the terms of award, apply to the use of the Agent(s) in this study: 
 
1. Agent(s) may not be  used for any purpose outside the scope of this protocol, 
nor can Agent(s) be transferred or licensed to any party not participating in the clinical study. Collaborator(s) data for Agent(s) are confidential and 
proprietary to Collaborator(s) and shall be m aintained as such by the 
investigators. The protocol documents for studies utilizing Agents contain 
confidential information and should not be shared or distributed without the

APPENDIX I: YOUTH INFO RMATION SHEETS  
 
INFORMATION SHEET REGARDING RESEARCH STUDY ADVL1 522 
(for children from 7 through 12 years of age) 
A study of the drug IMGN901  in children  
with a cancer  that has come back after treatment or is difficult to treat  
 
1. We have been talking with you about your cancer. You have had treatment for the cancer already 
but the cancer did not go away or it came back after treatment.  
 
2. We are asking you to take part in a research study because other treatments did not get rid of the 
cancer. A research study is when doctors work together to try out new ways to help people who are 
sick. In this study, we are trying to learn more about how to treat the kind of cancer that you have. 
We will do this by trying a new medicine to treat your cancer.  
 
3. Children who are part of this study will be treated with a cancer -fighting medicine called IMGN901 . 
You will also have regular tests and exams done more often while you are in this study. The doctors 
want to see if IMGN901  will make children with your type of cancer get better. We don’t know if 
IMGN901  will work well to get rid of your cancer. That is why we are doing this study.  
 
4. Sometimes good things can happen to people when they are in a research study. These good things 
are called “benefits.” We hope that a benefit to you of being part of this study is that IMGN901 
may cause your cancer to stop growing or to shrink for a period of time but we don’t know for sure if there is any benefit of being part of this study. 
 
5. Sometimes bad things can happen t o people when they are in a research study. These bad things 
are called “risks.” The risks to you from this study are that you may have more problems, or side 
effects, from IMGN901  than other treatments. Other things may happen to you that we don’t yet 
know about. 
 
6. Your family can choose to be part of this study or not. Your family can also decide to stop being 
in this study at any time once you start. There may be other treatments for your illness that your 
doctor can tell you about. Make sure to ask yo ur doctors any questions that you have. 
 
7. As part of your regular care, your doctor may have removed some tissue to see if you have cancer. 
If you take part in this study, we will  keep some of the tissue that is left over to do special tests. 
These tests may help us learn more about how IMGN901  works.

INFORMATION SHEET REGARDING RESEARCH STUDY ADVL1 522 
(for teens from 13 through 17 years of age) 
A study of the drug IMGN901 in children  
with a cancer that has come back after treatment or is difficult to treat  
 
1. We have been talking with you about your cancer. You have been diagnosed with one of the following 
types of cancer: Wilms tumor, Rhabdomyosarcoma, Neuroblastoma, Pleuropulmonary blastoma, 
Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor, or Synovial sarcoma. You have had treatment for the cancer 
already but the cancer did not go away or it came back after treatment .  
 
2. We are asking you to take part in a research study because other treatments did no t get rid of the cancer . 
A research study is when doctors work together to try out new ways to help people who are sick. In this 
study, we are trying to learn more about how to treat the kind of cancer that you have. 
 
3. Children and teens who are part of this study will be given a cancer -fighting medicine called IMGN901 . 
IMGN901 is a drug made of an antibody attached to an anti -cancer drug. An antibody is a protein used 
by the body’s immune system to fight foreign or diseased cells. The antibody used in IMGN901 attaches to cancer cells that have a protein called CD56. Then the anti -cancer drug causes these cancer cells to 
die. We are using IMGN901 in this study because it seems to work against certain types of cancer cells in test tubes and animals. IMG N901 is considered experimental because the Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) has not approved this drug. The dose of IMGN901 used in this study was found 
to be well- tolerated in adults. 
 
4. You will get IMGN901 by vein on Days 1 and 8 of a 21 -day period. This entire 21 -day period is called 
a cycle. You may continue to receive IMGN901  for up to about 12 months ( up to 17 cycles) as long as 
you do not have bad effects from it and your cancer does not get any worse. You will also have exams and tests done that  are part of normal cancer care. But, the exams and tests will be done more often 
while you are being treated with IMGN901. The doctors want to see if IMGN901 will make children 
with your type of cancer get better. We don’t know if IMGN901 is better than o ther medicines. That is 
why we are doing this study.  
 5. Sometimes good things can happen to people when they are in a research study. These good things are 
called “benefits.” We hope that a benefit to you of being part of this study is that IMGN901  may cause 
your cancer to stop growing or to shrink for a period of time but we don’t know for sure if there is any 
benefit of being part of this study. 
 6. Sometimes bad things can happen to people when they are in a research study. These bad things are 
called “risks.” The risks to you from this study are that you may have more problems, or side effects, 
from IMGN901  than other treatments. Other things may happen to you that we don’t yet know about. 
 7. Your family can choose to be part of this study or not. Your family can also decide to stop being in this 
study at any time once you start. There may be other treatments for your illness that your doctor can 
tell you about. Make sure to ask your doctors any questions that you have.  
 
8. As part of your regul ar care, you r doctor may have removed some tissue to see if you have cancer. If 
you take part in this study, we will keep some of the tissue that is left over to do special research tests. 
These tests may help us learn more about how IMGN901  works. The samples will come from leftover 
tissue so there would be no extra procedures.

MYO -0601 REV 04: A Prospective Non -Randomized, Unblinded Study Evaluating the Treatment of Knee 
Osteoarthritis with the Cryo -Touch III Device  1. Introduction 
1.1. Background 
Over 100 million patients in the United States suffer from chronic pain. Chronic 
pain conditions are often debilitating, taking a toll on a patient’s physical and 
mental welfare . Though a variety of pain management techniques currently exist , 
the most common nonsurgical options provide slow-acting and/or short- term 
relief. Medication, often in the form of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and opioids, comes with an array of side effects such as nausea and vomiting. Medication also presents the possibility of more serious effects such as increased risk of heart attack and stroke, and tolerance or dependency issues. Surgical strategies tend to be reserved for more severe cases and are limited by the risks and complications typically associated with surgery including bleeding, bruising, scarring, and infection.  A nonsurgical, minimally invasive, long-lasting approach to chronic pain management is desirable. 
 
Myoscience, Inc. (Redwood City, CA) has developed a pain management device – the Cryo-Touch III – for a novel, minimally invasive procedure using focused 
cold therapy to target sensory nerve tissue and offer long-lasting pain relief through cryoanalgesia. The device operates on the well-established cryobiology principle that localized exposure to controlled moderately low temperature conditions can alter tissue function.  The therapy treats nerves with low temperatures via a cold probe in the form of an assembly of small diameter needles, creating a highly localized treatment zone around the probe.  This focused cold therapy creates a conduction block that prevents nerve signaling. Prior studies of Cryo-Touch, Cryo-Touch II, Cryo-Touch III (a.k.a. PCP 1.0) have provided preliminary evidence of effectiveness on motor nerves and have been shown to be safe with no serious device-related adverse events.   
 
Though studies have proven efficacious in targeting motor nerves, the device’s effect on sensory nerves has yet to have been investigated in the clinical setting . 
The goal of the study described herein is to evaluate the degree and duration of effect of the Cryo -Touch III in reducing chronic pain by targeting sensory nerves.   
1.2. Device Description 
The Cryo -Touch III device (a.k.a. PCP 1.0) (Figure 1) is a minimally invasive 
needle-based device. The device consists of a re-usable portable Control Unit, Handpiece, single use Cryoprobes (Figure 2) and Cryogen Cartridges. The Control Unit and Handpiece are powered by the Control Unit utilizing connection to a standard power outlet and is microprocessor controlled. Its functionality is driven by an operator controlled on/off switch. The unit displays indicator lights to guide the operator. The system produces the desired effects through initiation

Osteoarthritis with the Cryo -Touch III Device  of a cooling cycle. Each cooling cycle is initiated by subcutaneous insertion of the 
Cryoprobe into the selected site and activation of the cryogen flow. A freezing zone forms around the tip of the Cryoprobe and the adjacent tissue. The Cryogen 
Cartridges are provided in individually sealed pouches. Each cartridge contains a nitrous oxide cylinder encased with a safety cap and filtering. The Cryoprobes are supplied in sterile packaging and are single-patient use. The Cyroprobe tips are closed, no cryogen enters the insertion site. A skin warmer provides warming at the base of the Cryoprobe tips to keep the surface above freezing temperatures.

MYO -0601 REV 04: A Prospective Non -Randomized, Unblinded Study Evaluating the Treatment of Knee 
Osteoarthritis with the Cryo -Touch III Device  Once the subject is determined to be eligible, the subject will be scheduled 
for the next visit.  The Screening Visit 1 and Treatment Visit 2 may occur on the same day. Every effort will be made to reduce the time between Screening and Treatment Visits if possible. 
 
2.6.2. Visit 2/Treatment (Day 0)  
2.6.2.1. Pre-Treatment/Evaluation Preparation 
 
No special preparation by the subject is required prior to the treatment. The investigator will reaffirm eligibility criteria and the subject’s willingness to continue partic ipation in the trial. Any changes in 
concomitant medications/concurrent procedures will be recorded.  Any adverse events that may have occurred prior to treatment will be documented as a change in medical history.   Non-invasive ultrasound imaging of the treatment area may be captured. Nerve stimulation may be used to assess location of nerves via a percutaneous nerve stimulator or a transcutaneous nerve stimulator.  
The Cryo-Touch III device will be used on awake subjects who are 
prepared with dermal anesthesia only. The skin in the treatment area will be cleansed with alcohol.  Local anesthetic will be injected into target sites with the goal of complete cutaneous anesthesia at the target treatment areas  prior to the treatment.   
The target of treatment is the infrapate llar branch of the saphenous nerve. 
The nerve will be accessed by locating adjacent landmarks and treating in a linear fashion to capture the nerve as it travels inferiorly (see Figure 3).  
Subjects with a bilateral indication will receive treatment in both knees.

2.6.2.2. Treatment 
The Cryo-Touch III device will have been prepared by the trained 
investigator (or Sponsor designee) according to the Instructions for Use 
(IFU) as provided by myoscience (see supplementary material) . 
Representatives of myoscience may be present at the treatment. 
Photography of the treatment area may be taken. Videography may also be captured during the treatment.  
Varying t reatment algorithms will be pre-determined by the sponsor and 
placed into cohorts as appropriate for anyalysis. This is intended to 
determine the most effective method of treatment and device optimization. Algorithms may include the following parameters: temperature, length of treatment, number of treatment cycles, probe tip design, and probe length. 
If at any time the device does not perform as expected the investigator (or 
designee) we follow procedures as outlined in the IFU.  
2.6.2.3. Post-Treatment 
Upon completion of treatment, the treatment area will be cleansed and the 
skin will be left undressed. Pressure to the treatment area with gauze 5-10 minutes may be applied to minimize bleeding.  The subject will be instructed in post-treatment care.   
The subject will be instructed to report any adverse events or treatment 
side effects (e.g., excessive redness, swelling, bruising, soreness, altered sensation, etc.) to the investigator betw een and at follow-up visits. Non-
invasive ultrasound may be used to assess the volume and location of the

treatment area may be obtained.  
The subject will be scheduled and instructed for their follow-up visits and 
discharged from the clinic. 
2.6.3. Visit 3/ Maintenance (Day 7) & Visit 4/Maintenance (Day 30)  
Subject will be evaluated and data collected per the schedule of events. Any changes in concomitant medications/concurrent procedures will be assessed . 
Any anticipated observations, adverse events, and/or SAE/UADE of the previous treatment site(s) will be assessed and documented. Non-invasive ultrasound imaging of the treatment area may be captured. Photography may be taken of the treatment area.  
2.6.4. Visit 5/Study Exit (Day 56) – Telephone Follow- Up 
Subject will be contacted via telephone and data collected since their last visit per the schedule of events. Any changes in concomitant medications/concurrent procedures will be assessed . Any an ticipated 
observations, adverse events, and/or SAE/UADE of the previous treatment site(s) will be documented.  
If the treatment effect remains at Day 56 the subject will be followed every 
four (4) weeks via telephone until Day 84. Any clinically significant adverse 
event will be followed until resolution. The subject will exit the study after 
Day 56 once there is no longer a treatment effect or the Day 84 follow-up is 
completed and no ongoing clinically significant events.  
Study exit data will be collected and the subject reminded to contact the 
investigator if any new previously unreported event occurs as it related to the treatment. 
A subject is considered to have exited (a completer) the study after completing all scheduled visits. In the event that a subject does not attend a scheduled visit every effort will be made to reschedule and those efforts will be documented. In the event of a subject lost to follow-up a study exit will be completed.   If a subject decides to withdraw participation early, the subject will be 
requested to complete a final study visit and exit the study. The investigator or sponsor may at any time during the study remove a subject if there is any potential safety issue or extreme non-compliance. In all cases every attempt will be made to complete a final study visit.

MYO -0601 REV 04: A Prospective Non -Randomized, Unblinded Study Evaluating the Treatment of Knee 
Osteoarthritis with the Cryo -Touch III Device  3.1.5. Safety Measures [Data Collection]  
Adverse events and SAEs/UADEs will be assessed at all visits.  Incidence of 
serious adverse events (SAEs) and unanticipated adverse device effects (UADEs) will be recorded. A serious adverse event is one that meets the ISO definition of SAE (see section 4.2.1). 
3.2. Adverse Event Reporting  
 
Adverse events (AEs)  will be assessed continuously from initiation of study treatment 
through study exit. An AE can be any unfavorable and unintended sign (e.g., an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a device , 
without any judgment about causality.  An AE can arise from any use of the device (e.g., off-label use, use in combination with any drug) and from any route of administration including an overdose. 
Timely and complete reporting of all AEs assists the Sponsor in identifying any untoward 
medical occurrence, thereby allowing:  
1) protection of the safety of study subjects;  
2) a greater understanding of the overall safety profile of the device ;  
3) recognition of device-related toxicity or ill effects; 
4) appropriate modification of study protocols;  
5) improvements in study design or procedures; and  
6) adherence to worldwide regulatory requirements.   
AEs may be either spontaneously reported or elicited during questioning and examination of a subject.  All AEs must be completely recorded within subject ’s source 
documentation.  If known, the investigator should report the diagnosis of the underlying illness or disorder, rather than its individual symptoms.  Subjects experiencing AEs that cause interruption or discontinuation of participation, or those experiencing AEs that are present at the end of their participation in the study should receive follow-up as appropriate.  If possible, report the outcome of any AE that caused permanent discontinuation or that was present at the end of the study particularly if the AE was considered by the investigator to be definitely, probably, or possibly related to the study device.  
The investigator will instruct the subject to report any adverse events that may occur 
during the study.  At each visit, the investigator should ask the subject, in non-directive fashion, about any change in the subject’s overall condition since the previous visit.

MYO -0601 REV 04: A Prospective Non -Randomized, Unblinded Study Evaluating the Treatment of Knee 
Osteoarthritis with the Cryo -Touch III Device  3.2.1. Serious Adverse Event (SAE)/Unanticipated Adverse Device Effect 
(UADE)  
A device-related SAE is an AE that meets the ISO definition for SAE and is rated by the 
investigator to be related to the study device.  No device- related SAEs have been reported 
in prior studies of Cryo-Touch II. 
Per ISO14155, an international clinical trial standard, an SAE is an AE that: 1 led to a death, 
2 led to a serious deterioration in the health of the subject that 
a. resulted in a life-threatening illness or injury, 
b. resulted in a permanent impairment of a body structure or a body 
function, 
c. required in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing 
hospitalization, 
d. resulted in medical or surgical intervention to prevent permanent 
impairment to body structure or a body function. 
3 led to fetal distress, fetal death or a congenital abnormality or birth defect 
 
An event that is serious must be recorded on the AE worksheet and requires expeditious handling to comply with regulatory requirements. 
Events NOT considered to be serious adverse events are: 
x Hospitalizations for the treatment, which was elective or pre-planned, of a 
pre-existing condition that did not worsen, and 
x Treatment on an emergency, outpatient basis for an event not fulfilling any of the definitions of “serious” given above and not resulting in hospital 
admission. 
An unanticipated adverse device effect  (UADE) is any of the following events that is 
caused by, or associated with, a device, if that effect, problem, or death was not previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the investigational plan or application (including a supplementary plan or application): 
x Any serious adverse effect on health or safety. 
x Any life-threatening problem. 
x Death. 
x Any other unanticipated serious problem associated with a device that relates 
to the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects.

MYO -0601 REV 04: A Prospective Non -Randomized, Unblinded Study Evaluating the Treatment of Knee 
Osteoarthritis with the Cryo -Touch III Device  Report of any UADEs shall be submitted to Sponsor within 24 hours of knowledge of the 
event. 
UADEs and AEs that are classified as “serious” by the investigator or the Sponsor requir e 
expeditious handling and reporting to the Sponsor.  All SAEs , whether related or 
unrelated to the study device, must be immediately (within 24 hours of becoming aware 
of the SAE) reported to the sponsor by telephone or confirmed facsimile transmission: 
Tracey Henry, John Allison, and/or Study Manager  myoscience, Inc. 650-474-2600 (office) 650-474-2900 (fax)  
In addition, such information should also be provided to the site’s respective IRB per their governing guidelines for SAE /UADE reporting.  If only limited information is 
initially available, follow-up reports are required.  Should the investigator become aware of an SAE (regardless of its relationship to the device) that occurs within 30 days after completion of the study, the SAE must be reported in accordance with procedures specified in this protocol.  In the event of death, if an autopsy is performed, a copy of the report should be sent to the Sponsor, if available. 
As required, the Sponsor will notify all investigators of any UADE within 10 working 
days of the Sponsor’s receipt of the effect.   
Upon receiving such notices, the investigator must review and retain the notice and 
immediately submit a copy of this information to the responsible IRB according to local regulations.  The investigator and IRB will determine if the informed consent requires 
revision.  The investigator should also comply with the IRB procedures for reporting any other safety information.  Where required, submission of Safety Updates by the investigator to Health Authorities should be handled according to local regulations.

MYO -0601 REV 04: A Prospective Non -Randomized, Unblinded Study Evaluating the Treatment of Knee 
Osteoarthritis with the Cryo -Touch III Device  4.2. Risks  
The Cryo-Touch III device involves percutaneous access to subcutaneous tissue 
using a needle and use of dermal anesthesia.  Passage of a needle into the skin and delivery of local anesthesia are known and may be documented as anticipated observations (AO). See list in section 3.1.4.   These reactions do not typically require medical intervention on the part of the investigator and are usually transient.  Self-care with compression or oral non-narcotic analgesics usually suffices. 
In the event that an AO  exceed s the expected response to the treatment, either in 
severity or in duration by the investigator’s assessment, they will be reported as 
AEs per Section 3.2. 
Additional adverse events which have occurred but are considered to be rare 
include: 
x Infection/Fever  
x Weakness which could result in difficulty ambulating  
x Limitations in range of motion of joint  
x Vasovagal reaction to needle insertion  
x Burns, blistering, or scarring due to heat or cold injury

Osteoarthritis with the Cryo -Touch III Device  Appendix D: WOMAC 
 
The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC) is a widely used, proprietary set of standardized questionnaires used by health professionals to evaluate the condition of patients with osteoarthritis of the knee and hip, including pain, stiffness, and physical functioning of the joints. The WOMAC has also been used to assess back pain, rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and fibromyalgia. It can be self-administered and was developed at Western  
Ontario and McMaster  Universities in 1982. [1]  
 The WOMAC measures five items for pain (score range 0–20), two for stiffness (score range 0–8), and 17 for functional limitation (score range 0–68). [2]. Physical functioning questions cover everyday activities such as stair use, standing up from a sitting or lying position, standing, bending, walking, getting in and out of a car, shopping, putting on or taking off socks, lying in bed, getting in or out of a bath, sitting, and heavy and light household duties. [3]  A WOMAC test takes about 12 minutes, but is also available in a short form, (although this has not been as extensively tested as the full version). Versions of the WOMAC have also been developed that can be used in telephone or online surveys. [3]  The WOMAC is among the most widely used assessments in arthritis research. For example, it appears as a search keyword in more than 1500 papers cataloged in PubMed, as of June 2012. It has been translated into more than 65 languages. [1]  The American College of Rheumatology notes that the test-retest reliability of the WOMAC varies for the pain, stiffness, and function subscales. The ACR says the pain subscale "has been variable across studies but generally meets the minimum standard." Reliability for the physical function scale "has been more consistent and stronger... but the stiffness subscale has shown low test-retest reliability."[3] When used in clinical studies, the WOMAC pain and function subscales perform comparably or better than other tests in being responsive to change from experimental interventions, but this varies for the different subscales and types of intervention.  An example of a intended WOMAC index is attached for reference.

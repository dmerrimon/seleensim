Clinical  Experience  with AZD1775  

13(64) Clinical Study  Protocol  
Drug Substance AZD1775  
Study  Number  18304  
Edition  Number  6  
Date: April 8, 2020   
 AZD1775  has been  administered  to patients  in 17 AstraZeneca -sponsored  or Merck - 
sponsored  clinical studies,  10 of which  are ongoing.  
 
For details,  please  see the current Investigator’s  Brochure.  
 
The initial  clinical  study  of AZD1775  (PN001)  was designed  to assess  the safety  and tolerability  
of AZD1775  monotherapy  and in combination  with cytotoxic  agents.  Patients  in the initial  part 
of this study  were  assigned  to a single  cycle  of AZD1775  monotherapy  in order  to establish  the 
clinical  safety  profile  of the study  drug (Schellens  et al., ASCO  2009.  Abstract:  3510).  Following  
the initial  monotherapy  treatment  cycle,  patients  continued  to combination  treatment,  
comprising  AZD1775  with cisplatin,  carboplatin,  or gemcitabine  (Leijen  S et al., ASCO  2010.  
Abstract: 3067; Brana  I., ASCO  2013.  Abstract: 5518).  
 
As of 11 November 2018,  approximately  863 patients  have  been  exposed  to AZD1775  in 
AstraZeneca -sponsored  or Merck -sponsored  clinical studies.  In addition, approximately  
706 patients  have  also received  AZD1775  as part of externally -sponsored  scientific  research.  
Based  on the safety data  from the completed  adavosertib  clinical studies  and preliminary  data 
from ongoing  studies  adverse  drug reactions  to adavosertib  monotherapy  include:  anemia,  
neutropenia  and febrile  neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, QTc  prolongation,        
gastrointestinal  events  such  as dyspepsia, diarrhea,  nausea  and vomiting  (with  or without  
dehydration  or serum  electrolyte  decreases), as well as decreased  appetite.  In addition, the 
following  events  are also considered  expected  during  treatment with adavosertib  in 
combination  with cytotoxic  chemotherapy: febrile  neutropenia, leukopenia, stomat itis, 
asthenia, fatigue, mucosal inflammation  and myalgia. Based  on information  emerging  during  
the clinical development programme  of adavosertib,  potential risks  where  a causal  
relationship  with adavosertib  monotherapy  has not been  established  include  asthenia/fatigue,  
gastrointestinal  hemorrhage,  lymphopenia/lymphocyte  count  decreased, leukopenia/WBC  
count  decreased, myalgia,  stomatitis, sepsis  and transaminases  elevation. In addition, the 
following  events  are also considered  potential risks  for adavosertib  in combination  with 
cytotoxic  chemotherapy: pancytopenia.  
Refer  to the IB for adavosertib  for information  on the potential  benefits  and assessment  of 
potential and  known  risks.  
 
The single -dose  maximum  tolerated  dose  (MTD)  in both gemcitabine  and cisplatin  combination  
therapy  is 200 mg of AZD1775.  Dose -limiting  toxicities  (DLTs)  tended  to be hematologic  in the 
gemcitabine  group  and constitutional  in the cisplatin  group.  The single -dose  MTD  in 
combination  with carboplatin  was 325 mg of AZD1775;  DLTs  in this group  were  related  to 
serum chemistry.  Similar  DLTs  have  been  observed  in the multiple -dose  chemotherapy  
combinations. These types  of toxicities  are not unexpected  for therapies  that include  full-dose  
chemotherapy.  Patients  should  therefore  be closely  monitored  for signs  of gastrointestinal  
(including  diarrhea),  hematologic,  and laboratory  toxicities  and managed  clinically  with 
supportive  care measures.  Based  on these  studies  and the current  ongoing  trial in ovarian  
cancer  (NCI#  [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]),  the recommended  phase  II dose  is as follows:  AZD1775  225 
mg twice  daily (BID)  day 1 to day 3 (5 doses)  plus carboplatin  AUC5  every  21 days/paclitaxel  
175 mg/m2 for 6 cycles followed  by maintenance  AZD1775.

Study  Number  18304  
Edition  Number  6  
Date: April 8, 2020   
 In Study  PN001,  of 176 evaluable  patients  who received  AZD1775  (either  single  or multiple  
doses)  as monotherapy  or in combination  with gemcitabine,  cisplatin,  or carboplatin,  a partial  
response  (PR) (confirmed  and unconfirmed)  was observed  in 17 (9.7%)  patients,  and stable  
disease  (SD) was observed  in 94 (53.4%)  patients.  
 
No complete  or PRs were  observed  in either  of Studies  PN005  or PN008  at the time that they 
were  terminated.  
 
Significance  
 
SQCLC  is an incurable  disease,  with current  therapy  producing  a survival  benefit,  although  it 
is small.  In addition,  there  is no FDA-approved  triplet  combination  in this patient  population.  It 
was demonstrated  that carboplatin  in combination  with paclitaxel  has significant  clinical  activity  
in this disease  with an overall  response  rate of 26%.  This is remarkable;  however,  74% of 
patients  do not respond.  Therefore,  it is important  to develop  combination  therapies  to improve  
the efficacy  and to discover  resistance  mechanisms.  One potential  class  of agents  that could  
be used  in combination  with platinum  chemotherapy  is WEE1  inhibitors.  As it is likely  that 
combination  therapies  will need  to be developed  to produce  significant  effects,  we thus propose  
to perform a phase  II study  in which  the combination  is evaluated.  
 
As a single  agent,  AZD1775  has not been extensively  studied  in clinical  trials. Carboplatin  has 
significant  activity  in lung cancer  due to its ability  to create  DNA adducts  that lead to DNA 
damage  and cytotoxicity.  p53 mutant  SQCLC  may be more  dependent  on the G2/M  checkpoint  
for correction  of DNA damage.  In the setting  of DNA damage  occurring  though  platinum - 
induced  adducts,  a medication  such  as a WEE1  inhibitor,  which  further  prevents  functionality  
of this checkpoint,  may lead to enhanced  effects.  There  have  been  trials extensively  testing  
the combination  of a WEE1 inhibitor  plus platinum  chemotherapy  in SQCLC patients.  
 
Innovation  
 
The sensitivity  and resistance  mechanisms  to AZD1775  in combination  with platins  are 
currently  unknown. Several  possibilities  exist,  including  the expression  of key regulators  of the 
cell cycle.  We will perform  pre- and post-treatment  tumor  biopsies  of the patients,  which  will 
allow  us to characterize  the biomarkers  in the clinical  responders  and the nature  of the 
resistance  mechanisms  in the clinical non -responders.  
 
1.2 Research  hypothesis  
Hypothesis:  In patients  with p53-mutant  SQCLC  with high expression  of G2/M  checkpoint  
proteins  WEE1  and PAXIP1  (defined  as WEE1  and/or  PAXIP1  positive),  we expect  to find that 
treatment  with carboplatin -paclitaxel  and AZD1775  will improve  progression -free survival  
(PFS).  
 
 
 
Rationale  1.3 Rationale  for conducting this  study  
15(64) Clinical Study  Protocol  
Drug Substance AZD1775  
Study  Number  18304  
Edition  Number  6  
Date: April 8, 2020   
 The overall  5-year survival  for non-small -cell lung cancer  (NSCLC),  which  is used  as a 
benchmark  for putative  cure from this disease,  is presently  only 15%10. The majority  of patients  
will present  with late-stage  disease.  SQCLC  represents  the second  most  common  type of 
NSCLC.  The trial's  rationale  is based  on the fact that standard  of care in first-line treatment  for 
patients  with advanced -stage  SQCLC  is platinum  doublet  chemotherapy11-13. While the  phase  
II trial by Johnson  et al demonstrated  that compared  to carboplatin -paclitaxel,  carboplatin - 
paclitaxel  plus bevacizumab  offered  statistically  significantly  improved  time to progression  in 
chemo -naive  NSCLC  patients  (n = 67; 4.2 vs. 7.4 months;  P = 0.023;  respectively),  the majority  
of the major  bleeding  events  including  hemoptysis  occurred  in those  patients  with squamous  
histology.  Based  on these  findings,  the phase  III trial excluded  patients  with SQCLC.  
Furthermore,  complete  responses  are rare and eventual  progression  is inevitable  in patients  
with advanced  SQCLC.  Hence,  there  is a great  need  for the development  of newer  agents  and 
innovatively  designed  clinical trials  to test these  newer  agents.  
 
In the lab, AZD1775  is a powerful  anticancer  drug;  clinical  trials are underway.  The 
identification  of a key molecular  event  that determines  the biological  response  of cells to WEE1  
inhibitor  treatment  may help to identify  clinically  relevant  PD markers  to assess  tumor  sensitivity  
or resistance  at the early  stages  of therapy.  In NSCLC  cell lines,  we have  demonstrated  that 
cisplatin  has exhibited  enhanced  effects  in combination  with the AZD1775  (a WEE1 inhibitor).

3. STUDY  PLAN  AND  PROCEDURES  
 
 
 
Study  Design  3.1 Overall study  design and flow chart  
 
This is a multicenter -center  phase  II trial of carboplatin,  paclitaxel,  and AZD1775  in patients  
with advanced/metastatic  SQCLC.  Patients  will be treated  with carboplatin  AUC5  and paclitaxel  
175 mg/m2 plus AZD1775  225 mg once  daily for one day and twice  daily for two days  for a total 
of 5 doses  over days  1-3. Each  cycle  will be 21 days  (Table  1). The doses  of carboplatin,  
paclitaxel,  and AZD1775  are based  on prior phase  I studies  of AZD1775  in patients  with 
advanced  solid tumors  (Schellens  et al, ASCO  2011,  #3068;  Leijen  et al., ASCO  2010.  
Abstract:  3067;  Brana,  ASCO  2013,  Abstract:  5518)  and ongoing  phase  II studies  in ovarian  
cancer.  Following  6 cycles  of treatment,  patients  will then go on to continue  maintenance  
treatment  with AZD1775.  Treatment  will continue  until disease  progression,  intolerable  toxicity,  
or withdrawal  from study.  Radiographic  evaluation  will occur  on days  0 (baseline),  42, and 
every  two cycles  there  after by CT. The data will be summarized  as clinical  response  measured  
continuously.  Toxicities  will be evaluated  according  to CTCAE  v.4 guidelines.  Archival  tumor  
will be collected  for correlative  studies.  In addition,  serial  pre- and post-treatment  tumor  
biopsies  will be performed  in a minimum of 7-10 patients.  
 
Inclusion  of Women  and Minorities:  Both men and women  of all races  and ethnic  groups  
are eligible  for this trial. 
 
Safety:  CTCAE  v.4 will be used  to monitor  patients  for safety  and tolerability.  Careful  toxicity  
assessment  will be performed  with standard  laboratory  studies  (CBC,  BUN,  creatinine,  
electrolytes,  and LFTs)  before  each  treatment.  In addition,  a medical  history  and physical  
examination  will be performed  before  each  cycle.  
 
Patients  will receive  intravenous  (IV) treatments  in a clinical  research  unit or infusion  center,  
which  is staffed  by nurses  experienced  in the management  of infusion  reactions  and cytokine  
release  syndrome.  All SAEs  with a determination  of SAE-relatedness  to the investigational  
therapy  will be reported  as described  in the data and safety  monitoring  plan detailed  in the 
protocol.  
 
Efficacy:  Radiographic  assessments  will be performed  every  2 cycles  and will be assessed  
by RECIST  v1.1.  Patients  who are found  to have  stable  disease  (SD),  partial  response  (PR),  
or complete  response  (CR) at re-staging  after the initial  4-6 cycles  will receive  additional  
AZD1775  every  21 days  until evidence  of disease  progression.  More  specifically,  as per 
standard  of care practice,  for patients  who are noted  to have  additional  tumor  regression  
following  4 cycles  of treatment  and are tolerating  the triplet  combination,  then 2 additional  
cycles  will be administered  per treating  physician/PI  discretion . Response  rate, overall  survival,  
and progression -free survival  will be determined.

10. No reproductive  toxicology  nor teratogenic  studies  have  been  conducted  with AZD1775  
to date,  and it is unknown  whether  the drug is excreted  in human  milk. Therefore,  women  
of childbearing  potential  and men should  agree  to use adequate  contraception  prior to 
study  entry  and for the duration  of study  participation  and women  who are breast  feeding  
are excluded  from the study.  Both women  and men should  be fully informed  of the lack of 
reproductive  toxicity  testing,  and women  must  have  a negative  pregnancy  test prior to 
enrolment.  
 
Female  patients  are considered  to be of childbearing  potential unless:  
 
• they are post-menopausal  (defined  as older  than 50 years  and amenorrhoeic  
for at least 12 months  following  cessation  of all exogenous  hormonal  
treatments),  
 
• there  is documentation  of irreversible  surgical  sterilization  by hysterectomy,  
bilateral oophorectomy or bilateral  salpingectomy  (but not tubal ligation),  or

 • they are 50 years  or younger  but have  been  amenorrhoeic  for at least 12 months  
following  the cessation  of exogenous  hormonal  treatments and  have  serum  
follicle -stimulating  hormone  (FSH)  and luteinizing  hormone  (LH) levels  in the 
postmenopausal range  for the institution.  
 
Female  patients  who are of childbearing  potential  must  agree  to use adequate  
contraceptive  measures  (as defined  below)  for the duration  of study  participation,  
and for 90 days  after the  final dose  of study  drug;  cessation  of birth control  after this  
point  should  be discussed  with a responsible  physician.  They  also may not be breast  
feeding  and must  have  a negative  serum  or urine  pregnancy  test within  72 hours  
prior to start of study  treatment.  
 
Male patients  who are sexually  active  with a female  partner  of childbearing  potential  
must  be either  surgically  sterilized  or agree  to use barrier  contraception  (i.e., 
condoms)  for the duration  of study  participation,  and for 90 days  after the final dose  
of study  drug;  cessation  of birth control  after this point  should  be discussed  with a 
responsible  physician.  
 
Female  patients  who are of child-bearing  potential  (as defined  above)  should  use 
enhanced  methods  of contraception  from the time of screening  until 90 days  after 
the final dose  of study  drug;  cessation  of birth control  after this point  should  be 
discussed  with a responsible  physician.  Acceptable  methods  of contraception  
include  true abstinence  in line with the preferred  and usual  lifestyle  choice  of the 
subject,  tubal ligation,  vasectomized  partner,  and methods listed  in the table  below.  
All methods  of contraception  (with the exception  of total abstinence)  should  be used  
in combination  with the use of a condom  by their male  sexual  partner  for intercourse.  
Periodic  abstinence,  the rhythm  method,  and the withdrawal  method  are not 
acceptable  methods  of birth control.  
 
Should  a woman  become  pregnant  or suspect  she is pregnant  while  participating  in 
this study,  she should  inform  her treating  physician  immediately.

 5. STUDY  CONDUCT  
5.1 Subject  enrollment  and initiation of  
investigational product  
After  screening  patient  will be treated  with AZD1775  PO in combination  with IV 
carboplatin  and paclitaxel  every  3 weeks  for 4-6 cycles  at the discretion  of the 
treating  physician.  Patients will  be treated  with carboplatin  AUC5  and paclitaxel 175  
mg/m2 plus AZD1775  225 mg once  daily for one day and twice daily for two days  for 
a total of 5 doses  over days 1-3. Following  4-6 cycles of  treatment,  AZD1775  will be 
continued  for 5 doses  over Days  1-3 for each  subsequent  cycle  until disease  
progression,  study  withdrawal,  or intolerance.  The carboplatin  and paclitaxel  will be 
administered  in the CRU  or Infusion  center  and AZD1775  will be distributed  to the 
patient  by the investigational pharmacy.  
 
 
5.2 Procedures  for handling subjects  
incorrectly  enrolled  
Any patient  identified  to be incorrectly  enrolled  will be counted  as a screen  failure  
and be replaced.  Any patients  falling  into this category  may continue  on treatment  
as long as there  is no evidence  of progressive  disease  by RECIST  v 1.1 or evidence  
of intolerance.  Patients  will be allowed  to re-screen.

 concomitantly  with the Day 1 infusion  of paclitaxel  +carboplatin,  followed  by four 
additional  doses  of AZD1775  to be taken  in approximate  12-hour intervals  (BID for a 
total of 5 doses).  
 
All patients  must receive  a 5-HT3 antagonist,  ondansetron  (Zofran) 8 mg PO BID or 
granisetron  (Kytril)  1 mg PO BID prior to each  dose  of AZD1775.  In addition,  
dexamethasone  4 mg PO will be given  with each  AZD1775  dose  unless  
contraindicated  or not well-tolerated.  Dexamethasone  or the 5-HT3 antagonist  may 
be given  by IV. 
Please  note:  aprepitant  [Emend]  and fosaprepitant  are not permitted  due to known  
DDIs.  
 
Due to frequent  reports  of diarrhea  with AZD1775  administration,  vigorous  anti- 
diarrheal  treatment  loperamide  (Imodium)  is required  at the first onset  of diarrhea  
according  to American  Society  of Clinical  Oncology  (ASCO)  guidelines.  Patients  
should  be instructed  to take oral loperamide  (Imodium)  2 mg every  2 hours  until 
diarrhea -free for at least 12 hours.  Patients  should  be instructed  to notify  the 
Investigator  or research  staff for the occurrence  of blood  or black  stools,  symptoms  
of dehydration,  fever,  inability  to take liquids  by mouth,  and inability  to control  
diarrhea  within  24 hours  of using  loperamide   or  other  prescribed  antidiarrheal  
medications.  
 
 
 
If the patient  misses  a dose  of AZD1775,  the patient  should  take the dose  as soon  
as possible,  but not more  than 6 hours  after the missed  scheduled  dose,  If greater  
than 6 hours,  the missed  dose  should  be skipped  and the patient  should  take the 
next dose  when  scheduled.  
 
If vomiting  occurs  after the patient  takes  the AZD1775,  the patient  should  be 
instructed  not to retake  the dose,  but to wait until the next scheduled  dose  of 
AZD1775.   If vomiting  persists, the patient should  contact the  Investigator.  
 
5.3.3  Labeling  and storage  
Investigational  drugs  are properly  labeled  as provided  by AstraZeneca  at all times  
and properly  stored  according  to the supplier’s  recommendations.  They  are 
administered  only upon  written  order  of the authorized  principal  investigator,  or 
his/her  designee,  who must  be a member  of the medical  staff.  All investigational  drug 
supplies  for patient  use are kept in the pharmacy.  Each  drug is stored  separately  for 
each  protocol.  The pharmacy  maintains  a separate  Drug  Accountability  Record  
Form,  which  reflects  drug supply  for each  investigational  agent  and protocol.  The 
form contains  all of the necessary  information  regarding  the disposition  of the drug 
and the storage  site. Other  drug documentation  (e.g.,  receipt  of drug,  internal  
transfers, returns,  broken  vials,  etc.) is recorded  on this form.

 5.4 Concomitant  and post -study  
treatment(s)  
Formal drug -drug interaction  studies  have  not yet been  performed  with AZD1775;  
therefore, the potential  for drug-drug interaction  described  in this protocol  are 
based  on findings  from in vitro studies  and clinical experience.  
 
 
5.4.1  The following  treatments  are prohibited  while  
in this study  (for a full list, see Appendix  “A”) 
Prescription  and non-prescription  agents  known  to be moderate  to strong  
inhibitors/inducers  of CYP3A4  or sensitive  CYP3A4  substrates  or substrates  of 
CYP3A4  with a narrow  therapeutic  window  that cannot  be discontinued  2 weeks  
before  first dose  of AZD1775 and  withheld  throughout  the study  until 2 weeks  after 
the last dose  of AZD1775  are prohibited.  The use of grapefruit  juice is prohibited  2 
weeks  prior to,  during  the study, and  2 weeks  after the last dose  of AZD1775.  
– Strong  Inhibitors  of CYP3A4  include:  azole  antifungals  (ketoconazole,  fluconazole,  
voriconazole,  and itraconazole),  macrolide  antibiotics  (clarithromycin  and 
erythromycin),  calcium  channel  blockers,  HIV protease  inhibitors  (indinavir,  
nelfinavir,  and ritonavir), and  cimetidine,  aprepitant,  and nefazodone.  
– Inducers  of CYP3A4:  phenytoin,  barbiturates,  and rifampicin  
– Substrates  of CYP3A4:  statins  (lovastatin,  simvastatin),  midazolam,  terfenadine,  
astemizole,  and cisapride  
Refer  to Appendix  “A” for a list of inhibitors,  inducers  and substrates  of CYP3A4.  
Supportive  care with a CYP3A4  inhibitor/inducer/substrate  according  to institutional  
guidelines  in the context  of standard  of care chemotherapy  will be exempt;  however,  
concomitant  treatment  with aprepitant  is not allowable  per protocol.  See AZD1775  
IB for additional information.  
• In vitro data suggest  that AZD1775  may also be a weak  reversible  inhibitor  of 
CYP2C19.  Caution  should  be exercised  with concomitant  administration  of AZD1775  
and agents  that are sensitive  substrates  of CYP2C19,  or substrates  of this enzyme  
with narrow  therapeutic  range;  please  refer to Appendix  A for a list of sensitive  
substrates  of CYP2C19,  or substrates  of this enzyme  with narrow  therapeutic  range.  
• In vitro studies  have  shown  that AZD1775  may be a substrate  and inhibitor  for 
human  P-glycoprotein  (P-gp). Caution  should  be exercised  when  inhibitors  or 
substrates  of P-gP are administered  with AZD1775.  
• Use of metformin  is prohibited  in this study  as recent  in vitro transporter  data have  
shown  that AZD1775  is an inhibitor  of Multidrug  and Toxin  Extruder  1 (MATE1)  and 
MATE2K.  Caution  should  be used  when  administering  drugs  that are substrates  of 
these  transporters  (e.g.,  cimetidine,  acyclovir,  fexofenadine)  as the clinical  relevance  
of AZD1775  inhibition  of the MATE  pathway is not known  in these  compounds.  
• Aprepitant  or Fosaprepitant  use is prohibited  in this study.  No formal  clinical  
drug interaction  studies  have  been  performed  with AZD1775.  An exploratory  
assessment  of the effect  of aprepitant  on AZD1775  exposure  in oncology  patients  
suggests  that there  is a drug interaction  between  AZD1775  and aprepitant,  as

Study  Number  18304  
Edition  Number  6  
Date: April 8, 2020   
 exposure  to AZD1775  increased  by ~40%  when  aprepitant  was co-administered  
with AZD1775.  The observed  increase  in AZD1775  exposure  is likely  the result  of 
CYP3A4  inhibition  by aprepitant.  This increase  in exposure  is statistically  
significant.  At the selected  MTDs,  this increase  may also be of clinical  importance.  
Therefore,  concomitant  treatment  with aprepitant  is not allowable  per protocol  until 
further evaluation.  See AZD1775  Investigator’s  Brochure for more  information.  
• Atorvastatin  use is prohibited in this study.  Recent in  vitro transporter studies have  
shown  AZD1775  to be an inhibitor  of BCRP  (IC50=5.1  μM). This finding  is particularly  
relevant  for drugs  administered  orally  where  exposure  is normally  limited  by BCRP - 
mediated  efflux,  in particular  some  statins.  Modeling  has predicted  a substantial  
increase  in the exposure  of atorvastatin  when  coadministered  with AZD1775,  and 
the use of atorvastatin  is therefore  prohibited  in the current  study.  Other  drugs  where  
the disposition  is mediated  via BCRP  should  be administered  with caution,  with dose  
modification  considered  or substituted  by an alternative  drug.  
• Herbal  preparations/medications  are not allowed  throughout  the study.  These  
herbal  medications  include,  but are not limited  to: St. John’s  wort,  kava,  ephedra  (ma 
huang),  gingko  biloba,  dehydroepiandrosterone  (DHEA),  yohimbe,  saw palmetto,  
and ginseng.  Patients  should  stop using  these  herbal  medications  7 days  before  first 
dose  of AZD1775.  
• AZD1775  has been  shown  to be a weak  inducer  of CYP1A2  in vitro.  Taking  into 
account  the anticipated  plasma  concentrations  (Cmax<1.5  μM) and the intermittent  
nature  of the AZD1775  dosing  schedule,  however,  the risk of induction  in the clinic  
is considered  low. No specific  precautions  are recommended  at this time,  except  to 
be initially  vigilant  when  using  substrates  of CYP1A2  with a narrow  therapeutic  
range.  
• Caution  must  be exercised  with the concomitant  use of aminoglycosides  in keeping  
with the treatment  guidelines  for carboplatin.  
• Paclitaxel  is metabolized  by CYP2C8  (mainly)  and CYP3A4.  Appendix  D provides  
a list of CYP2C8  inhibitors  that should  be excluded  as concomitant  medications.  This 
list is not all-inclusive,  and for other  concomitant  medications,  the Investigator  and 
AstraZeneca  will determine  if they are known  to significantly  influence  CYP2C8.  
In addition,  Investigators  should  look at a frequently  updated  drug reference  such  as 
Lexicomp  to see if any medicine  they want to prescribe  is on a list of drugs  to avoid.  
 
5.4.2  Growth  factors  for neutrophils  or RBCs  used  in 
accordance  with established  guidelines  are 
allowed.  
5.4.3  Palliative  (limited -field)  radiation  therapy  is 
permitted,  if all of the following  criteria  are met: 
1. Repeat  imaging  demonstrates  no new sites of bone  metastases.  
2. The lesion  being  considered  for palliative  radiation  is not  a target lesion.  
5.5 Dose  Modifications  
Dose  adjustments  will be based  on the organ  system  exhibiting  the greatest degree  of toxicity.  
Dose  reductions  or holds  and initiation  of supportive  care are allowed as clinically  indicated  by

 the treating  physician.  A maximum  of 2 dose  reductions  for the AZD1775  and chemotherapy  
will be allowed.  Patients  requiring  >2 dose  reductions  of these  drugs  will be discontinued  from 
the study  drug and chemotherapy.  
 
Brief treatment  or visit delays  (±7 days)  for public  holidays  or weather  conditions  do not 
constitute  a protocol  violation  but should  be recorded  in the electronic  case  report  form (eCRF).  
 
Any patient requiring  a toxicity -related  dose  delay  of more  than 28 days  from the intended  day 
of the next scheduled  dose  must  be discontinued  from the study  unless  there is  approval  from 
the Study  PI for the patient to continue.  
 
The AZD1775  and chemotherapy  dose  level reductions  are presented  in Table  2. 
The hematologic  and non-hematologic  Dose  modifications  and guidelines  are as presented  in

Dose  modification  due to hematological toxicity  
Complete  blood  counts  (CBC)  will be obtained  for all patients  at the beginning  of each  
treatment cycle  (Day  1). If hematologic  toxicity  occurs  (see Table  3), treatment should  be held 
and ANC  and platelets  should  be monitored  weekly  until recovery.  However,  if the investigator  
determines  that the hematologic  toxicity  was due to one study  drug and not the other,  treatment  
with the remaining  study  drug may continue  as clinically  appropriate  or dose  reductions  can be 
done  solely  for the agent  that is felt to be the cause  of the AE. This should  be clearly  
documented  in the EMR.

patient  will be removed  from the study  treatment.  
 
 
Non-hematologic  toxicity  dose  modifications  
Dose  modifications  for non-hematologic  toxicities  should  be based  on toxicities  occurring  
during  the previous  cycle.  For toxicities  that lead to a dose  reduction,  the dose  will not be 
reescalated  during  subsequent  cycles.  Any patient  who develops  a Grade  3 or 4 
nonhematologic  toxicity,  that does  not resolve  to ≤ Grade  1 within 28 days  should  be removed  
from the study  treatment.  However,  if the investigator  determines  that the nonhematologic  
toxicity  was due to one study  drug and not the other,  treatment  with the remaining  study  drug 
may continue  as clinically  appropriate  or dose  reductions  can be done  solely  for the agent  that 
is felt to be the cause  of the AE. This  should  be clearly  documented  in the EMR.  
Based  upon  the maximum  non-hematologic  toxicities  experienced  during  the previous  cycle,  
dose  adjustments  for subsequent  cycles  are to be made  according  to the criteria  defined  in

Non-hematologic  toxicity  management  guidelines  
5.5.1  Diarrhea  
Patients  should  be instructed  to notify  the Investigator  or research  staff for the occurrence  of 
blood  or black  stools,  symptoms  of dehydration,  fever,  inability  to take liquids  by mouth,  and 
inability  to control  diarrhea  within  24 hours  of using  loperamide  or other  prescribed  antidiarrheal  
medications.  
In the event  of Grade  3 or 4 diarrhea,  the following  supportive  measures  are recommended:  
hydration  and anti-diarrheals.   If diarrhea  is severe   (i.e., requiring  IV rehydration)   and/or  
associated  with fever  or severe  neutropenia  (Grade  3 or 4), broad -spectrum  antibiotics  must  
be prescribed.  Patient  with severe  diarrhea  or any diarrhea  associated  with severe  nausea  or 
vomiting  should  be hospitalized  for IV hydration  and correction  of electrolyte  imbalances.  
 
5.5.2  Nausea  and vomiting Anti-emetic  therapy  (excluding  aprepitant  [Emend]  or 
fosaprepitant)  may be used  in accordance  with standard  practice  and/or the  discretion  of the 
investigator.

Drug Substance AZD1775  
Study  Number  18304  
Edition  Number  6  
Date: April 8, 2020   
  
5.5.3  Febrile  neutropenia  
Patients  experiencing  febrile  neutropenia  with significant  symptoms  should  be managed  in a 
hospital  setting  according  to standard  procedures,  with the urgent  initiation  of IV antibiotic  
therapy.  Patients  with febrile  neutropenia  without  symptoms  should  be managed  according  to 
standard  guidelines.  
 
5.5.4  Motor  neuropathy  or muscle  weakness  
Any onset  of > Grade  2 motor  neuropathy  or > Grade  2 muscle  weakness  should  be evaluated  
by an electromyogram  to rule out the possibility  of chronic  inflammatory  demyelinating  
polyneuropathy  (CIDP).  With a diagnosis  of CIDP  the patient  should  be discontinued  from study  
treatment.  
5.5.5  Dose  modifications  for infusion  reactions  
Infusion  reactions  (e.g. rash,  urticaria,  erythema,  pruritus,  bronchospasm,  and hypotension)  
can occur  with the agents  used  in this study.  There  is increased  risk of a reaction  with 
carboplatin  and paclitaxel.  Carboplatin  must  be discontinued  in patients  experiencing  a Grade  
3 or 4 infusion  reaction  during  treatment.  
To identify  the grade  of a reaction,  refer to the list below  adapted  for the General  Disorders  and 
Administration  Site Conditions  section  of the NCI CTCAE  v4.03:  
 
• Grade  1: Mild transient  reaction;  infusion  interruption  not indicated;  intervention  not 
indicated.  
• Grade  2: Therapy  or infusion  interruption  indicated  but responds  promptly  to 
symptomatic  treatment  (e.g.,  antihistamines,  NSAIDs,  narcotics,  IV fluids  indicated  for 
≤24 hours). 
• Grade  3: Prolonged  (e.g., not rapidly  responsive  to symptomatic  mediation  and/or  brief 
interruption  of infusion);  recurrence  of symptoms  following  initial  improvement;  
hospitalization  indicated  for other  clinical  sequelae.  Note:  any infusion  that is interrupted  
and not resumed  within  the visit will be considered  a Grade  3 reaction.  
• Grade  4: Life-threatening  consequences;  urgent intervention  indicated.  
 
 
5.6 Treatment  compliance  
Patients  participating   in  this  study   will  be  expected   to  be  compliant   with  the 
medications  and study  schedule.  
 
5.6.1  Accountability  
Patient  compliance  will be monitored  by pill diaries.  
 
5.7 Discontinuation of investigational  
product  
In the absence  of treatment  delays  due to adverse  event(s),  treatment  may continue  for 
the time described  above  or until one of the following  criteria  applies:  
 
• Disease  progression,  
• Intercurrent illness  that prevents  further  administration  of treatment,  
32(64) Clinical Study  Protocol  
Drug Substance AZD1775  
Study  Number  18304  
Edition  Number  6  
Date: April 8, 2020   
 • Unacceptable  adverse  event(s),  
• Patient  decides  to withdraw  from the study, or 
• General  or specific  changes  in the patient's  condition  render the patient  
unacceptable  for further treatment in  the judgment of the investigator.  
 
5.8 Withdrawal  from study  
Patients  can withdraw  from the study  or from further  treatments  at any time.  
Clarifications  should  be made  with the patient  whether  they wish to withdraw  from 
the study  or from further  treatment.  The reason  for study  or treatment  withdrawal  
and the date the patient  was removed  must  be documented  in the Case  Report  
Form.  
 
 
6. COLLECTION OF STUDY  VARIABLES  
6.1 Recording of  data 
Research  data are kept in a secure  database  with limited  access  and through  OnCore  (a Web- 
based,  password -protected  database),  with privacy  protected  to the full extent  of the law. 
Authorized  research  investigators,  the Department  of Health  and Human  Services,  and the 
Institutional  Review  Board  may inspect  the records.  Final  approvals  have  been  obtained  from 
the IRB. Additional  protection  is provided  through  the data safety  and monitoring  plan described  
below.  
 
6.2 Data  collection at enrollment  and 
follow -up 
6.2.1  Enrollment procedures  
Informed  consent  must  be obtained  before  any testing  to determine  a patient’s  eligibility.  Once  
a patient  is enrolled  in the study,  he/she  will be assigned  a simple 2 or 3 digit number,  with the 
first patient  assigned  to 01 and so on. A separate  spreadsheet  with password  protection  will 
be maintained  that contains  the patient ’s study  number  along  with personally  identifiable  
information.  Password  protection  will be maintained  in order  to keep  patient  information  strictly  
confidential.  Upon  signing  the informed  consent  form,  the patient  will be assigned  a subject  
number  by the investigator  or his/her  designee. Once  assigned  to a patient,  a subject  number  
will not be reused.  If the patient  fails to be started  on treatment  for any reason,  the reason  for 
not being  started  on treatment  will be entered  on the Screening  Log CRF,  and his/her  
demographic  information  will be captured  in the OnCore  system.  All laboratory,  radiologic,  and 
pathologic  data collected  on trial participants  will be assigned  the unique  treatment  number  
and stored  in a separate  database  (OnCore).

6.2.2  Follow -up procedures  
Patients  will be followed  for 30 days  after removal from study  or until death,  whichever  occurs  
first. Patients  removed  from study  for unacceptable  adverse  event(s)  will be followed  until 
resolution  or stabilization  of the adverse  event.  
 
6.2.3  Criteria  for Removal from  Study  
Patients  will be removed  from study  when  any of the criteria  listed  in Section  4.3 applies.  The 
reason  for study  removal  and the date the patient  was removed  must  be documented  in the 
Case  Report  Form.  
 
 
 
6.3 Efficacy  
In addition  to a baseline  scan,  confirmatory  scans  should  also be obtained  4-6 weeks  following  
initial  documentation  of objective  response.  Response  and progression  will be evaluated  in this 
study  using  the new international  criteria  proposed  by the revised  Response  Evaluation  Criteria  
in Solid   Tumors   (RECIST)   guideline   (version   1.1)14.    Changes  in  the  largest   diameter

 (unidimensional  measurement)  of the tumor  lesions  and the shortest  diameter  in the case  of 
malignant  lymph  nodes  are used 15. 
 
 
 
6.3.1  Disease  Parameters  
 
• Measurable  disease . Measurable  lesions  are defined  as those  that can be accurately  
measured  in at least one dimension  (longest  diameter  to be recorded  for non-nodal  lesions  
and short  axis for nodal  lesions)  as >20 mm by chest  x-ray, as >10 mm with CT scan,  or 
>10 mm with calipers  by clinical  exam.  All tumor  measurements  must  be recorded  in 
millimeters  (or decimal  fractions  of centimeters).  Note:   Tumor  lesions  that are situated  in 
a previously  irradiated  area might  or might  not be considered  measurable.  If the investigator  
thinks  it is appropriate  to include  them,  only lesions  that have  clearly  shown  disease  
progression  since  prior irradiation  will be considered  or allowed.  
• Malignant  lymph  nodes . To be considered  pathologically  enlarged  and measurable,  a 
lymph  node  must  be >15 mm in short  axis when  assessed  by CT scan  (CT scan  slice 
thickness  recommended  to be no greater  than 5 mm).  At baseline  and in follow -up, only 
the short axis will be measured  and followed.  
• Non-measurable  disease . All other  lesions  (or sites of disease),  including  small  lesions  
(longest  diameter  <10 mm or pathological  lymph  nodes  with ≥ 10 to <15 mm short  axis),  
are considered  non-measurable  disease.  Bone  lesions,  leptomeningeal  disease,  ascites,  
pleural/pericardial  effusions,  lymphangitis  cutis/pulmonitis,  inflammatory  breast  disease,  
and abdominal  masses  (not followed  by CT or MRI),  are considered  as non-measurable.  
Note:  Cystic lesions  that meet  the criteria  for radiographically  defined  simple cysts  should  
not be considered  as malignant  lesions  (neither  measurable  nor non-measurable)  since  
they are, by definition,  simple  cysts.  “Cystic  lesions”  thought  to represent  cystic  metastases  
can be considered  as measurable  lesions,  if they meet  the definition  of measurability  
described  above. However,  if non-cystic  lesions  are present  in the same  patient,  these  are 
preferred  for selection  as target lesions.  
• Target  lesions.  All measurable  lesions  up to a maximum  of 2 lesions  per organ  and 5 
lesions  in total,  representative  of all involved  organs,  should  be identified  as target  lesions  
and recorded  and measured  at baseline.  Target  lesions  should  be selected  on the basis  
of their size (lesions  with the longest  diameter),  be representative  of all involved  organs,  
but in addition  should  be those  that lend themselves  to reproducible  repeated  
measurements.  It may be the case  that, on occasion,  the largest  lesion  does  not lend itself 
to reproducible  measurement,  in which  circumstance  the next largest  lesion  which  can be 
measured  reproducibly  should  be selected.  A sum of the diameters  (longest  for non-nodal  
lesions, short  axis for nodal  lesions)  for all target  lesions  will be calculated  and reported  as 
the baseline  sum diameters.  If lymph  nodes  are to be included  in the sum,  then only the 
short  axis is added  into the sum.  The baseline  sum diameters  will be used  as reference  to 
further  characterize  any objective  tumor  regression  in the measurable  dimension  of the 
disease.  
• Non-target  lesions . All other  lesions  (or disease  sites)  including  any measurable  lesions  
over the 5 target  lesions,  should  be identified  as non-target  lesions  and should  also be 
recorded  at baseline.  Measurements  of these  lesions  are not required,  but the presence,  
absence,  or in rare cases  unequivocal  progression  of each  should  be noted  throughout  
follow -up.

6.3.2  Methods  for Evaluation  of Measurable  
Disease  
 
 
All measurements  should  be taken  and recorded  in metric  notation  using  a ruler or calipers.  
All baseline  evaluations  should  be performed  as closely  as possible  to the beginning  of 
treatment  and never more  than 4 weeks  before  the beginning  of the treatment.  
 
The same  method  of assessment  and the same  technique  should  be used  to characterize  each  
identified  and reported  lesion  at baseline  and during  follow -up. Imaging -based  evaluation  is 
preferred  to evaluation  by clinical  examination  unless  the lesion(s)  being  followed  cannot  be 
imaged  but are assessable  by clinical exam.  
 
• Clinical  lesions:  Clinical  lesions  will only be considered  measurable  when  they are 
superficial  (e.g.,  skin nodules  and palpable  lymph  nodes)  and 10 mm diameter  as 
assessed  using  calipers  (e.g.,  skin nodules).  In the case  of skin lesions,  documentation  by 
color  photography,  including  a ruler to estimate  the size of the lesion, is  recommended.  
• Chest  x-ray: Lesions  on chest  x-ray are acceptable  as measurable  lesions  when  they are 
clearly  defined  and surrounded  by aerated  lung.  However,  CT is preferable.  
• Conventional CT  and MRI:  This guideline  has defined  measurability  of lesions  on CT scan  
based  on the assumption  that CT slice thickness  is 5 mm or less. If CT scans  have  slice 
thickness  greater  than 5 mm, the minimum  size for a measurable  lesion  should  be twice  
the slice thickness.  MRI is also acceptable  in certain  situations  (e.g.,  for body  scans).  Use 
of MRI remains  a complex  issue.  MRI has excellent  contrast,  spatial,  and temporal  
resolution;  however,  there  are many  image  acquisition  variables  involved  in MRI that 
greatly  impact  image  quality,  lesion  conspicuity,  and measurement.  Furthermore,  the 
availability  of MRI is variable  globally.  As with CT, if an MRI is performed,  the technical  
specifications  of the scanning  sequences  used  should  be optimized  for the evaluation  of 
the type and site of disease.  Furthermore,  as with CT, the modality  used  at follow -up should  
be the same  as was used  at baseline  and the lesions  should  be measured/assessed  on 
the same  pulse  sequence.  It is beyond  the scope  of the RECIST  guidelines  to prescribe  
specific  MRI pulse  sequence  parameters  for all scanners,  body  parts,  and diseases.  
Ideally,  the same  type of scanner  should  be used  and the image  acquisition  protocol  should  
be followed  as closely  as possible  to prior scans.  Body  scans  should  be performed  with 
breath -hold scanning  techniques, if possible.  
 
 
6.3.3  Response  Criteria  
 
6.3.3.1  Evaluation  of Target  Lesions  
 
• Complete  Response  (CR) : Disappearance  of all target  lesions.  Any 
pathological  lymph  nodes  (whether  target  or non-target)  must  have  reduction  in 
short axis to <10 mm.

Drug Substance AZD1775  
Study  Number  18304  
Edition  Number  6  
Date: April 8, 2020   
 • Partial Response  (PR): At least  a 30% decrease  in the  sum  of  the diameters 
of target  lesions, taking  as reference  the baseline  sum diameters.  
• Progressive  Disease  (PD): At least  a 20% increase  in the sum of the diameters 
of target  lesions, taking  as reference  the smallest sum  on study  (this includes  
the baseline  sum if that is the smallest  on study).  In addition  to the relative  
increase  of 20%,  the sum must  also demonstrate  an absolute  increase  of at 
least  5 mm. (Note:  the appearance  of one or more  new lesions  is also 
considered  progressions).  
• Stable  Disease  (SD): Neither  sufficient  shrinkage  to qualify  for PR nor sufficient  
increase  to qualify  for PD, taking  as reference  the smallest  sum diameters  while  
on study.  
 
 
6.3.3.2  Evaluation  of Non-Target  Lesions  
 
 
• Complete  Response  (CR): Disappearance  of all non-target  lesions  and 
normalization  of tumor  marker  level.  All lymph  nodes  must  be non-pathological  
in size (<10 mm short  axis).  Note:  If tumor  markers  are initially  above  the upper  
normal  limit, they must  normalize  for a patient  to be considered  in complete  
clinical response.  
• Non-CR/Non -PD: Persistence  of one or more  non-target  lesion(s)  and/or  
maintenance  of tumor  marker level above  the normal limits.  
• Progressive  Disease  (PD): Appearance  of one or more  new lesions  and/or  
unequivocal  progression  of existing  non-target  lesions.  Unequivocal  
progression  should  not normally  trump  target  lesion  status.  It must  be 
representative  of overall  disease  status  change, not  a single  lesion  increase.  
• Although  a clear  progression  of “non-target”  lesions  only is exceptional,  the 
opinion  of the treating  physician  should  prevail  in such  circumstances,  and the 
progression  status  should  be confirmed  at a later time by the review  panel  (or 
Principal  Investigator).  
 
 
6.3.3.3  Evaluation  of Best Overall Response  
 
 
The best overall  response  is the best response  recorded  from the start of the treatment  until 
disease  progression/recurrence  (taking  as reference  for progressive  disease  the smallest  
measurements  recorded  since  the treatment  started).  The patient's  best response  assignment  
will depend  on the  achievement  of both measurement and  confirmation  criteria.

Note:   Patients  with a global deterioration  of health  status  requiring  discontinuation  of 
treatment  without  objective  evidence  of disease  progression  at that time should  be 
reported  as “symptomatic  deterioration.”  Every effort should  be made  to document  
the objective  progression  even  after discontinuation  of treatment.

* ‘Non-CR/non -PD’ is preferred  over ‘stable  disease’  for non-target  disease  since  SD is 
increasingly  used  as an endpoint  for assessment  of efficacy  in some  trials so to assign  this 
category when  no lesions  can be  measured  is not advised  
6.3.4  Progression -Free  Survival  
 
Progression  free survival  (PFS)  is defined  as the time from start of treatment  (Cycle  1, Day 1) 
until the date of objective  disease  progression  or death  (by any cause  in the absence  of 
progression)  regardless  of whether  the patient  withdraws  from therapy  or receives  another  anti- 
cancer  therapy  before  progression.  Clinical  deterioration  in the absence  of radiographic  
evidence  is not considered  progression  for purposes  of determining  PFS.  Subjects  who die 
without a reported  prior progression  will be considered  to have  progressed  on the date of their 
death.  Subjects  who did not progress  or die will be censored  on the date of their last evaluable  
tumor  assessment.  Subjects  who did not have  any on study  tumor  assessments  and did not 
die will be censored  on the date they were  first treated.  Subjects  who started  any palliative  
local therapy  or subsequent  anti-cancer  therapy  without  a prior reported  progression  will be 
censored  at the last evaluable  tumor  assessment  prior to initiation  of the palliative  local therapy  
or subsequent anti -cancer therapy,  whichever  procedure  occurred  first. 
 
 
The PFS time  will always  be derived  based  on scan/assessment dates  not visit dates.  
 
RECIST  version  1.1 assessments/scans  contributing  towards  a particular  visit may be 
performed  on different dates.  The following  rules  will be applied:  
 
• Date  of progression  will be determined  based  on the earliest  of the dates  of the 
component that triggered  the progression  
 
• When  censoring  a patient  for PFS the patient  will be censored  at the latest  of the 
dates  contributing  to a particular  overall  visit assessment.  
 
6.3.5  Duration  of Response  
• Duration  of overall  response : The duration  of overall  response  is measured  from the 
time measurement  criteria  are met for CR or PR (whichever  is first recorded)  until the 
first date that recurrent  or progressive  disease  is objectively  documented  (taking  as 
reference  for progressive  disease  the smallest  measurements  recorded  since  the 
treatment  started).  The duration  of overall  CR is measured  from the time measurement  
criteria  are first met for CR until the first date that progressive  disease  is objectively  
documented. If a patient  does  not progress  following  a response,  then their duration  of 
response  will use the PFS censoring  time.  
• Duration  of stable  disease : Stable  disease  is measured  from the start of the treatment  
until the criteria  for progression  are met, taking  as reference  the smallest  
measurements  recorded  since  the treatment  started,  including  the baseline  
measurements.

6.3.6  Objective  Response  Rate  
ORR  is defined  as the number  of subjects  whose  best confirmed  objective  response  (BOR)  is 
a CR or PR, divided  by the number  of subjects  who received  at least one dose.  BOR  is defined  
as the best response  designation,  as determined  by the RECIST  v1.1,  recorded  between  
baseline  and the date of objectively  documented  progression  per RECIST  1.1 or the date of 
initiation  of palliative  local therapy  or the date of initiation  of subsequent  anticancer  therapy,  
whichever  occurs  first. For subjects  without  documented  progression  or palliative  local therapy  
or subsequent  anti-cancer  therapy,  all available  response  designations  will contribute  to the 
BOR  determination. The  final analysis  of ORR  will take place  at the time of PFS analysis.  
 
 
 
6.3.7  Overall Survival  
OS is defined  as the duration  of time from the date for first treatment  (Cycle  1 Day 1) to the 
date of death. A subject who has not died will be censored  at last known  date alive.  
 
 
 
6.3.8  Missing  Assessments and Not Evaluable  
Designation  
When  no imaging/measurement  is done  at all at a particular  time point,  the subject  is not 
evaluable  (NE) at that time point.  If only a subset  of lesion  measurements  can be made  at an 
assessment,  the case  is also considered  NE at that time point,  unless  a convincing  argument  
can be made  that the contribution  of the individual  missing  lesion(s)  would  not have  changed  
the assigned  time-point response.  
 
 
 
6.4 Safety  
 
 
6.4.1  Definition  of adverse  events  
An adverse  event  is the development  of an undesirable  medical  condition  or the deterioration  
of a pre-existing  medical  condition  following  or during  exposure  to a pharmaceutical  product,  
whether  or not considered  causally  related  to the product.  An undesirable  medical  condition  
can be symptoms  (e.g.,  nausea,  chest  pain),  signs  (e.g.,  tachycardia,  enlarged  liver),  or the 
abnormal  results  of an investigation  (e.g.,  laboratory  findings,  electrocardiogram).  In clinical  
studies,  an AE can include  an undesirable  medical  condition  occurring  at any time,  including  
run-in or washout  periods,  even  if no study  treatment has  been  administered.  
 
The term AE  is used  to include  both serious  and non-serious  AEs.  SAE collection  will initiate  
at time of consent while  AE collection  will initiate  on C1D1.

Drug Substance AZD1775  
Study  Number  18304  
Edition  Number  6  
Date: April 8, 2020   
 Death  as a result of disease  progression  is only to be assessed  as efficacy  measures  and not 
as AEs or SAEs.  
Adverse  events  will be assessed  according  to the Common  Toxicity  Criteria  for Adverse  Events  
(CTCAE)  version  4.0. CTCAE  v4.0 can be accessed  on the NIH/NCI  website  at 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/forms/CTCAEv4.pdf http://ctep.cancer.gov/forms/CTCAEv4.pdf . 
CTCAE  grade  5 (death)  will not be used  in this study;  rather,  this information  will be collected  
in the End of Treatment  or Survival  Information  CRF page.  Adverse  event  monitoring  should  
be continued  for at least 4 weeks  following  the last dose  of study  treatment.  
Adverse  events  (but not  serious  adverse  events)  occurring  before  starting  study  treatment but  
after signing  the informed  consent  form are recorded  on the Medical  History/Current  Medical  
Conditions  Electronic  Case  Report  Form  (OnCore).  Abnormal  Lab values,  vital signs  or test 
results  that do not induce  clinical  signs/symptoms  or require  therapy  will not be considered  
clinically  significant  and will not be reported  as Adverse  Events.  In addition,  isolated  abnormal  
laboratory  values  that are considered  clinically  significant  (e.g.,  cause  study  discontinuation  or 
constitutes  in and of itself a Serious  Adverse  Event)  should  be recorded  on the Adverse  Events  
CRF.  SAEs  occurring  after initiation  of treatment  are recorded  on the Adverse  Event  CRF.  
The occurrence  of adverse  events  should  be sought  by non-directive  questioning  of the patient  
at each  visit during  the study.  Adverse  events  also may be detected  when  they are volunteered  
by the patient  during  or between  visits  or through  physical  examination,  laboratory  test, or other  
assessments.  As far as possible,  each adverse  event  should  be evaluated  to determine:  
1. The severity grade  (CTCAE  grade 1-4) 
2. Its relationship  to AZD1775  (suspected/not suspected)  
3. Its duration  (start and  end dates  or if continuing  at final exam)  
4. Action  taken  (no action  taken;  study  drug dosage  adjusted/temporarily  interrupted;  
study  drug permanent ly discontinued  due to this adverse  event;  concomitant  
medication  taken; non -drug therapy  given;  hospitalization/prolonged  hospitalization)  
Information  about  common  side effects  already  known  about  the investigational  drug can be 
found  in the Investigator’s  Brochure  or will be communicated  between  IB updates  in the form 
of Investigator  Notifications.  This information  will be included  in the patient  informed  consent  
and should  be discussed  with the patient  during  the study  as needed.  
 
 
6.4.2  Definitions  of serious  adverse  event  
A serious  adverse  event is  an AE occurring  during  any study  phase  (i.e., run-in, treatment,  
washout, follow -up), that  fulfills  one or more  of the following  criteria:  
 
• Results  in death  
 
• Is immediately  life-threatening  
 
• Requires  in-patient  hospitalization  or prolongation  of existing  hospitalization  
 
• Results  in persistent  or significant disability/incapacity  or substantial disruption  of 
the ability  to conduct normal life  functions  
 
• Is a congenital abnorma lity or birth defect

Study  Number  18304  
Edition  Number  6  
Date: April 8, 2020   
 • Is an important  medical  event  that may jeopardize  the subject or may require  
medical intervention  to prevent  one of the outcomes  listed  above.  
 
The causality  of SAEs  (their  relationship  to all study treatment/procedures)  will be assessed  
by the investigator(s) and communicated  to AstraZeneca.  
 
6.4.3  Recording  of adverse  events  
 
 
In addition,  the following  variables  will be collected  for SAEs:  
• Date  AE met criteria  for serious  AE 
• Date  Investigator became  aware  of serious  AE 
• AE is serious  due to 
• Date  of hospitalization  
• Date  of discharge  
• Probable  cause of death  
• Date  of death  
• Autopsy  performed  
• Causality  assessment in  relation  to Study  procedure(s)  
• Causality  assessment in  relation  to Other medication  
 
Description  of AE 
It is important  to distinguish  between  serious  and severe  AEs.  Severity  is a measure  of 
intensity,  whereas  seriousness  is defined  by the criteria  in Section  6.4.2 . An AE of severe  
intensity  need  not necessarily  be considered  serious.  For example,  nausea  that persists  for 
several  hours  may be considered  severe  nausea,  but not a SAE.  On the other  hand,  a stroke  
that results  in only a limited  degree  of disability  may be considered  a mild stroke  but would  be 
a SAE.  
 
Adverse  Events  based  on signs  and symptoms  
When  collecting  AEs, the recording  of diagnoses  is preferred  (when  possible)  to recording  a 
list of signs  and symptoms.  However,  if a diagnosis  is known  and there  are other  signs  or 
symptoms  that are not generally  part of the diagnosis,  the diagnosis  and each  sign or symptom  
will be recorded separately.  
 
Adverse  Events  based  on examinations  and tests  
If deterioration  in a laboratory  value/vital  sign is associated  with clinical  signs  and symptoms,  
the sign or symptom  will be reported  as an AE and the associated  laboratory  result/vital  sign 
will be considered  as additional  information.  Wherever  possible,  the reporting  investigator  uses 
the clinical,  rather than  the laboratory  term (e.g.,  anemia  versus  low hemoglobin  value). In the 
absence  of clinical  signs  or symptoms,  clinically  relevant  deteriorations  in non-mandated  
parameters should  be reported  as AE(s).  
 
Deterioration  of a laboratory  value,  which  is unequivocally  due to disease  progression,  should  
not be reported  as an  AE/SAE.

Any new or aggravated  clinically  relevant  abnormal  medical  finding  at a physical  examination  
as compared  with the baseline  assessment  will be reported  as an  AE. 
 
 
Procedure  for serious  adverse  event  reporting  
 
The conduct of the study  will comply  with all FDA,  sponsor  and IRB safety  reporting  
requirements.  
 
All serious  adverse  experience  reports  must  include  the patient  number,  age, sex, weight,  
severity  of reaction  (mild,  moderate,  severe),  relationship  to study  drug (definitely  related,  
probably  related,  possibly  related,  unlikely  related,  unrelated),  date of administration  of test 
medications  and all concomitant  medications,  and medical  treatment  provided.  A MedWatch  
Form  3500A  will be used.  The reports  will include  the appropriate  HLMCC  PMC,  IRB, and FDA 
IND protocol  reference  numbers.  
 
The Principal  Investigator  is responsible  for evaluating  all adverse  events  to determine  whether  
criteria  for “serious”  and “unexpected”  as defined  above  are present.  All Serious  Adverse  
Events  regardless  of cause  will be entered  into the H. Lee Moffitt  Cancer  Center  & Research  
Institute  research  database  (OnCore)  and will be reported  to the Moffitt  Protocol  Monitoring  
Committee  (PMC).  
 
All SAEs  will be reported  to HLMCC  PMC,  IRB, and  FDA as per their requirements.  
 
 
 
6.5 Instructions  for Rapid  Notification of  
Serious  Adverse Events  
Information  about  all adverse  events,  whether  volunteered  by the subject,  discovered  by the 
investigator  questioning,  or detected  through  physical  examination,  laboratory  test or other  
means,  will be collected  and recorded  and followed  as appropriate.  An adverse  event  is any 
undesirable  sign,  symptom  or medical  condition  occurring  after starting  study  drug (or therapy)  
even  if the event  is not considered  to be related  to study  drug (or therapy).  Study  drug (or 
therapy)  includes  the drug (or therapy)  under  evaluation,  and any reference  or placebo  drug 
(or therapy) given  during  any phase  of the trial. 
 
• If it is unclear  what study  treatment includes, list  all drug(s),  other  therapies,  changes  to 
existing  therapy,  diagnostic  procedure,  etc. that are  specified  by the protocol  
Medical  conditions/diseases  present  before  starting  study  treatment  are only  considered  
adverse  events  if they worsen  after starting  study  treatment  (any procedures  specified  in the 
protocol).  Adverse  events  occurring  starting  after study  treatment  are recorded.  Abnormal  
laboratory  values  or test results  constitute  adverse  events  only if they induce  clinical  signs  or 
symptoms  or require  therapy and  are recorded.

Drug Substance AZD1775  
Study  Number  18304  
Edition  Number  6  
Date: April 8, 2020   
 Information  about  all serious  adverse  events  will be collected  and recorded  on the FDA 
MedWatch  3500a  form.  To ensure  patient  safety,  each  serious  adverse  event  must  also be 
reported  to AstraZeneca  within  24 hours  of learning  of its occurrence.  A serious  adverse  event  
is an undesirable  sign,  symptom,  or medical condition  that: 
 
1. is fatal or life-threatening  
2. required  or prolonged  hospitalization  
3. results  in persistent or significant  disability/incapacity  
4. constitutes  a congenital  anomaly  or a birth defect  
5. is medically  significant, may jeopardize  the subject  and may require  medical or surgical  
intervention  to prevent  one of the outcomes  listed  above.  
Events  not considered  to be serious  adverse  events  are hospitalizations  for the: 
 
• routine  treatm ent  or  monitoring   of  the  studied   indication,   not  associated   with  
any deterioration  in condition.  
• treatment,  which  was elective  or pre-planned,  for a pre-existing  condition  that did not 
worsen  
• treatment  on an emergency,  outpatient  basis  for an event  not fulfilling  any of the definitions  
of serious  given  above  and not  resulting  in hospital admission.  
Pregnancy,  although  not itself a serious  adverse  event,  should  also be reported  on a serious  
adverse  event  form or pregnancy  form and be followed  up to determine  outcome,  including  
spontaneous  or voluntary  termination,  details  of birth,  and the presence  or absence  of any birth 
defects or congenital  abnormalities.  
 
Any serious  adverse  event  occurring  after the patient  has provided  informed  consent,  has 
started  taking  the study  medication,  and until 4 weeks  after the patient  has stopped  study  
participation  must  be reported.  This includes  the period  in which  the study  protocol  interferes  
with the standard  medical  treatment  given  to a patient  (e.g.,  treatment  withdrawal  during  
washout  period,  change  in treatment  to a fixed  dose  of concomitant  medication).  The period  
after discontinuing  study  drug may be extended  if there  is a strong suspicion  that the drug has 
not yet been  eliminated.  
 
6.5.1  Instructions  for rapid  notification  of 
serious  adverse  events  
 
Reporting  responsibility  
 
The principal  investigator  has the obligation  to report  all serious  adverse  events  to the FDA,  
IRB, and AstraZeneca.  
 
Reporting  of serious  adverse  events  
For External Sites  
Information  about  all serious  adverse  events  will be collected and recorded. To ensure  
patient  safety,  each  serious  adverse  event must  be reported  to the PI and  to the sponsor  
44(64) Clinical Study  Protocol

 expeditiously.  Moffitt Cancer  Center and  all participating  sites will report  SAEs  by completing  
an SAE report in  OnCore, the electronic  data capture  system.  The SAE must  be reported  by 
email  (affiliate.research@moffitt.org) to the External Site  Coordination  (ESC)  office  within  2 
working  days. If  applicable,  the site should  also follow  protocol  guidelines  for additional  
reporting  to government agencies.  See Below.  
All Sites  Safety Reporting  
 
Investigators  and other  site personnel  must  inform  the FDA,  via a MedWatch/AdEERs  form,  of 
any serious  or unexpected  adverse  events  that occur  in accordance  with the reporting  
obligations  of 21 CFR 312.32,  and will concurrently  forward  all such  reports  to AstraZeneca.  A 
copy  of the MedWatch/AdEERs  report  must  be faxed  or emailed  to AstraZeneca  via the 
AstraZeneca  database  at the time the event  is reported  to the FDA.  It is the responsibility  of 
the investigator  to compile  all necessary  information  and ensure  that the FDA receives  a report  
according  to the FDA reporting  requirement  timelines  and to ensure  that these  reports  are also 
submitted  to AstraZeneca  at the  same  time.  
 
When  reporting  to AstraZeneca,  a cover  page  should  accompany  the MedWatch/AdEERs  form 
indicating  the following:  
 
• Investigator Sponsored  Study  (ISS)  
 
• The investigator IND  number assigned  by the FDA 
 
• The investigator’s  name  and address

 7. DATA  SAFETY  MONITORING PLAN  
7.1 Data  Monitoring Board  
7.1.1  Risk  to Subjects  
 
7.1.1.1  Human  Subject Involvement and  Characteristics  
 
 
Human  subjects  who have  the diagnosis  of advanced  SQCLC  are eligible  to participate  in the 
clinical trial described  in this proposal.  The risk to subjects  will be outlined  clearly  and in detail  
in the informed  consent.  Women  who are pregnant  are not eligible.  
 
7.1.2  Adequacy  of Protection  Against  Risk 
 
7.1.2.1  Recruitment and Informed  Consent  
Patients  who present  to the Thoracic  Oncology  Program  at the Moffitt  Cancer  Center  who have  
advanced  SQCLC  are offered  participation  in the clinical  trial described  in this proposal.  The 
trial is explained  in detail  to the patients  by one of the physician  co-investigators  on the trial, 
the patients  are given  the opportunity  to read the informed  consent  document,  they are given  
a chance  to ask questions,  and finally  they sign the informed  consent  document  in the presence  
of a witness.  The physician  who participates  in the informed  consent  process  also documents,  
in a clinic  note, the nature  of the consent  process  that occurred.  
 
7.1.2.2  Protection  Against  Risk 
To protect  participants  from excess  risk, the above -mentioned  study  procedures  and dose - 
escalation  scheme  were  instituted.  Additional  protection  is provided  through  the data safety  
and monitoring  plan described  below.  The complete  care of each  patient, including  the clinical  
management  of all toxicities,  are provided  to the patient  by physicians  at the Moffitt  Cancer  
Center.  The clinical  data are kept in the patient's  individual  Moffitt  Cancer  Center  hospital  
record.  Research  data are kept in a locked  room  with limited  access  and through  OnCore  (a 
Web-based,  password -protected  database),  with privacy  protected  to the full extent  of the law. 
Authorized  research  investigators,  the Department  of Health  and Human  Services,  and the 
Institutional  Review  Board  may inspect  the records.  Final  approvals  have  been  obtained  from 
the IRB. 
 
Additional  protection  is provided through  the data safety  and monitoring  plan described  below.  
 
 
7.1.3  Importance  of the Knowledge  to be Gained  
The development  of a well-tolerated  and effective  regimen  in a disease  could  potentially  at 
worst  add to the armamentarium  of available  regimens  and at best change  standard  of care.  
Specific  strategies  to improve  the care of patients  relapsing  following  chemotherapy  for lung 
cancer  are direly  needed.

 7.1.4  Data  Safety  and Monitoring  Plan 
 
The Data Safety  & Monitoring  Plan (DSMP)  will ensure  that this trial is well designed,  
responsibly  managed,  appropriately  reported,  and that it protects  the rights  and welfare  of 
patients.  The following  internal  and external  review  and monitoring  processes  provide  oversight 
and active  monitoring  of this trial: 
• The Principal  Investigators  (PI) 
• The Clinical Trials  Office  (CTO)  
• The Scientific  Review  Committee  (SRC)  
• The Protocol Monitoring  Committee  (PMC);  
• The Research  Compliance  Division  (RCD)  of the Cancer  Center's  Compliance  Office;  
• Institutional  Review  Board  (IRB).  
 
The protocol  includes  a section  that specifies  the following  with respect  to Adverse  Event  
reporting:  what constitutes  an adverse  event  (versus  what is a serious  adverse  event),  the 
entities  to which  adverse  events  should  be reported,  the timing  of this reporting,  and the person  
or persons  responsible  for reporting.  This includes  prompt  (within  one day of knowledge  of the 
event)  reporting  to the IRB for unanticipated  risks to subjects  and reporting  in writing  within  five 
working  days  to the IRB and sponsor.  
 
7.2 Scientific  Review  Committee  (SRC)  
 
The Cancer  Center  maintains  two full board  Scientific  Review  Committees  (SRC),  meeting  
every  other  week  (the first Wednesday  and third Thursday  of every  month)  as well as one 
Behavioral  Ad-Hoc SRC.  
Each  SRC  conducts  a formal  internal  peer review  of all clinical  protocols  and general  scientific  
oversight  of interventional  clinical  research.  Protocols  are reviewed  for scientific  merit,  
adequate  study  design,  safety,  availability  of targeted  study  population,  and feasibility  of timely  
completion  of all proposed  research  projects  to be conducted  by its assigned  programs  at the 
Cancer  Center.  Each  SRC  is responsible  for evaluating  the risk/benefit  assessment  and 
corresponding  data and safety  monitoring  plan as part of the scientific  review  and approval  
process.  The SRC will refer any potential  conflicts  of interest  identified  in the proposed  
research  to the Conflict  Committee.  
7.3 PI Responsibility  
 
The PI of each  study  is ultimately  responsible  for every  aspect  of the design,  conduct,  and 
actions  of all members  of the research  team.  This includes  the final analysis   of  the protocol.  
The PI is responsible  for ensuring  that: 
All protocols  include  a DSMP  and procedures  for its implementation  commensurate  with the 
risk and complexity  of the study.  The DSMP  must  include  a structured  adverse  event  
determination,  monitoring  and reporting  system,  including  standardized  forms,  and procedures  
for referring  and/or  treating  subjects  experiencing  adverse  events.  The plan must  include  data 
and safety -monitoring  procedures  for subjects  enrolled  who may be receiving  a part of their 
protocol -required  treatment  at community  sites.

 In all cases,  the PI of the study  will have  primary responsibility  for ensuring  that the protocol  is 
conducted  as approved  by the SRC  and IRB. The PI will ensure  that the monitoring  plan is 
followed,  that all data required  for oversight  of monitoring  are accurately  reported  to a DSMB  
and/or  to the PMC  and IRB as required,  that all adverse  events  are reported  according  to 
protocol  guidelines,  and that any adverse   actions  reflecting  patient   safety   concerns   are 
appropriately  reported.  
7.4 Protocol Monitoring  Committee  (PMC)  
The PMC  meets  once  a month.  The PMC  reviews  and evaluates  safety  and/or  efficacy  data 
for all physician  authored  clinical  intervention  trials.  The PMC  ensures  the safety  of patients  
and the validity and integrity  of data.  PMC  reviews  SAEs,  deviations, Interim  analysis,  interim  
and final reports  from the external  Data  Monitoring  Committee  (DMC)  as well as audits  both 
internally  and externally.  The PMC  can make  the following  determinations,  Accepted,  
Acceptable  with Corrective  Action,  and Tabled.  
Investigators  of studies,  which  are designated  to be  reviewed  by the PMC  for data and safety  
monitoring,  shall provide  an interim  statistical  analysis  report  of the study’s  progress  and 
summary  of adverse  events  and deviations  based  on the phase  of the study  and the associated  
risk of the study  or more  often  if applicable.  The external  DSMB  (if applicable)  shall forward  its 
report  for high-risk studies  designated  for external  review  at least annually  or more  often  if 
applicable.  
7.5 Research  Compliance  Division (RCD)  
RCD  of the Corporate  Compliance  Office  is the coordinating  center  for internal  audits  of clinical  
trials conducted  at the Cancer  Center  and its affiliates.  The audit  procedure  is a formal,  
comprehensive,  source  document  review  of all clinical  trials.  External  audit  reports  that meet  
the criteria  of the internal  audit may be accepted  in lieu of an internal  audit.  
The (RCD)  shall provide  a report  to the PMC  of internal  audit  findings  for PMC  action.  A 
representative  of the RCD  will be present  to discuss  the audits  with the PMC.  For cause,  audits  
will be discussed  during  an executive  session  of the PMC.  Only members  (voting  and ex- 
officio) may attend  this session.  
 
 
7.6 The Institutional Review  Board  (IRB)  
Data  will be captured  in OnCore,  Moffitt ’s Clinical  Trials  Database.  Regulatory  documents  and 
case  report  forms  will be reviewed  routinely  by the MCC  Clinical  Research  Monitoring  Core  for 
accuracy,  completeness  and source  verification  of data entry,  validation  of appropriate  
informed  consent  process,  adherence  to study  procedures,  and reporting  of SAEs  and protocol  
deviations  according  to MCC  Monitoring  Policies . 
 
The trial will not be initiated  without  approval  of the appropriate  Institutional  Review  Board  
(IRB).  All administrative  requirements  of the governing  body  of the institution  will be fully 
complied  with. This protocol,  consent  procedures,  and any amendments  must  be approved  by 
the IRB in compliance  with current  regulations  of the Food  and Drug  Administration.  A letter  
of approval  will be sent to the institution(s) funding  the study  prior to initiation  of the study  and 
when  any subsequent  modifications  are made.  The IRB will be kept informed  by the 
investigator  as to the progress  of the study  as well as to any serious  or unusual  adverse  events.

The PMC  and/or  the IRB may vote to suspend  or terminate  approval  of a research  study  not 
being  conducted  in accordance  with the IRB, the Cancer  Center  and/or  regulatory  requirements  
or that has been  associated  with unexpected  problems  or serious  harm  to subjects.  The 
PMC/IRB  will notify  the PI in writing  of such  suspension  or terminations.  It is the responsibility  
of the PMC/IRB  Chairperson  to ensure  prompt  written  notification  of any suspensions  or 
terminations  of PMC/IRB  approval  to the relevant  Federal  Agencies,  including  OHRP,  FDA,  
the study  sponsor/funding  source  and if applicable, the Affiliate  Program.  
 
7.8 Trial  Discontinuation  
For reasonable  cause,  the Investigator  and/or  sponsor  may terminate  this study  prematurely.  
Conditions  that may warrant  termination  include but  are not limited  to: the discovery  of an 
unexpected,  significant,  or unacceptable  risk to the patients enrolled in the study  or if the  accrual  
goals  are met. A written  notification  of termination  will be issued.  
 
7.9 Monitoring of the  Study  and Regulatory  
Compliance  
The Principal  Investigator  and the Clinical  Research  Coordinator  assigned  to the case  will be 
primarily  responsible  for maintaining  all study -related  documents  including  the clinical  research  
forms.  ONCORE  will serve  as the study  database  of record.  All CRF entries  will be verified  with 
source  documentation  and will be maintained  by the Data  Management Specialist and  Clinical  
Research  Coordinator.  The patient  case  books  will be secured  in a locked  office  within  each  
institution’s  applicable  department . The review of medical  records  will be done  in a manner  to 
assure  that patient  confidentiality  is maintained.  
 
For External Sites  Only:  Data  Management and Monitoring/Auditing  
 
Data will be captured  in OnCore, Moffitt’s  Clinical  Trials  Database. Regulatory  documents  and 
case  report  forms  will be monitored  internally  according  to Moffitt  Cancer  Center  Monitoring  
Policies.  Monitoring  will be performed  regularly  to verify  data is accurate,  complete,  and 
verifiable  from source  documents;  and the conduct  of the trial is in compliance  with the currently  
approved  protocol/amendments,  Good  Clinical  Practice  (GCP),  and applicable  regulatory  
requirements.  
 
To obtain  access  to OnCore,  the External  Site Coordination  (ESC)  office  Coordinator  will 
supply  forms  required  to be completed  by the site staff.  Once  the completed  forms  are received,  
the site coordinator  will receive  DUO  access,  logon/password,  and information  on how to 
access  OnCore.  The ESC office  will provide  OnCore  training  to the site once  initial  access  is 
granted  and on an ongoing  basis, as needed.

 7.10 Protocol Modifications  
No modifications  will be made  to the protocol  without  the agreement  of the investigators.  
Changes  that significantly  affect  the safety  of the patients,  the scope  of the investigation,  or the 
scientific  quality  of the study  will require  Institutional  Review  Board  approval  prior to 
implementation,  except  where  the modification  is necessary  to eliminate  apparent  immediate  
hazard  to human  subjects.  Any departures  from the protocol  must  be fully documented  in the 
case report  form and the source  documentation.  
 
7.11 Patient  Privacy  
In order  to maintain  patient  confidentiality,  all case  report  forms,  study  reports,  and 
communications  relating  to the study  will identify  patients  by initials  and assigned  patient  
numbers.  The US Food  and Drug  Administration  (FDA)  may also request  access  to all study  
records,  including  source  documentation  for inspection.  
 
7.12 Records  Retention  
U.S. FDA regulations  (21 CFR §312.62[c])  require  that records  and documents  pertaining  to 
the conduct  of this study  and the distribution  of investigational  drug,  including  CRFs,  consent  
forms,  laboratory  test results,  and medication  inventory  records,  must  be retained  by the 
Principal  Investigator  for 2 years  after marketing  application  approval.  If no application  is filed, 
these  records  must  be kept 2 years  after the study  is discontinued  and the U.S. FDA and the 
applicable  national and  local health  authorities  are notified.  
 
 
8. BIOLOGICAL  SAMPLING  PROCEDURES  
8.1 Pharmacodynamics  
 
 
8.1.1  Collection  of pharmacodynamic  
markers  
In summary,  archival  tumor  specimens  and optional  serial  tumor  biopsies  will be collected.  
These  samples  will be used  to evaluate  potentially  predictive  biomarkers  and complete  other  
correlative  studies.  Archival  tissue  specimens  will be collected  on all participants.  Approximately  
125 μL of tumor  sample  is required  for this purpose.  Fresh  tumor  specimens  will be collected  by 
image -guided  biopsy  for those  without  available  archival  tissue.  In addition  optional  pre- and 
post-treatment  tumor  biopsies  will be obtained  on at least 7-10 total patients  during  the study.  
The biopsies  will be performed  under  image  guidance  (including  but not limited  to CT or 
ultrasound -guided  core biopsies)  as determined  by the location  of tumor  and risks associated  
with each  procedure.  Tumor  biopsies  will be performed  pretreatment  and at cycle  1, day 15 ± 
7 days.  
 
The tumor  collected  through  these  methods  will be analyzed  to explore  whether  positive  vs. 
negative  biomarkers  could  predict  response  and resistance  to the AZD1775 -carboplatin -

 paclitaxel  combination.  More  specifically  for the fresh  tumor  biopsies,  on-site evaluations  for 
tissue  quality  will be performed  by the cytotechnologist  to ensure  viable  tissue  and for collection  
of adequate  tumor  sample.  Four to 6 core biopsy  samples  will be collected.  At a minimum,  2 
will be placed  in neutral -buffered  formalin  and embedded  in paraffin  wax and two core needle  
samples  will be snap  frozen  and stored  in liquid  nitrogen.  
 
Immunohistochemistry  will be used  to assess  the levels  of the proposed  molecules  (WEE1,  
PAXIP  1, p53 in order  of priority)  in histological  tumor  collected  before  and after therapy  where  
appropriate.  Additional  biomarkers  may be explored  including  but not limited  to cleaved  Parp.  
We will utilize  advanced  NGS  DNA analyses  to test and identify  the p53 mutation  type,.  
Further,  exploratory  correlative  studies  may be completed  based  on the additional  data 
obtained  from the utilization  of an advanced  DNA platform  for p53 testing.  The collection  and 
interpretation  of additional  data has the potential  to help address  some  of the critical  barriers  
for effective  personalized  treatment.  
 
8.1.2  Molecular  Analyses  
After  obtaining  the results  from IHC, the associations  between  the biomarkers  (PAXIP1  and 
WEE1)  will be made  using  Spearman’s  correlation  coefficient.  
 
We will also test whether  p53 mutation  status  (yes/no  as determined  by sequencing)  is 
associated with patient response  (CR+PR)  using the unconditional  test.16 
 
In addition,  univariable  analyses  (Cox  regression  analysis)  will be performed  to see whether  
the markers  predict  for PFS.  The impact  of the change  in markers  on PFS (and overall  survival)  
and response  will be examined  using  Cox proportional  hazard  model  and logistic  regression,  
respectively.  The three  biomarkers  (WEE1,  PAXIP1,  and p53) will be tested  separately  and 
will be considered  significant  if P < 0.05.  The change  in both the PAXIP1  and WEE1  marker  
scores  will be assessed  using  the normal  scores  test. All analyses  will be carried  out using  
SAS 9.3 statistical software  (SAS, Inc, Cary,  NC). 
 
Pre- and post-treatment  biopsies  will be obtained  on at least 7-10 total patients  from the 
SQCLC  study.  The biopsies  will be performed  under image  guidance  (including  but not limited  
to CT or ultrasound -guided  core biopsies)  as determined  by the location  of tumor  and risks 
associated  with each  procedure.  Tumor  biopsies  will be performed  pretreatment  and at cycle  
1, day 15 ± 7 days.  Here  we will explore  the extent  to which  changes  between  pre- and post- 
treatment  levels  correlate  with response.  This will be done  on the percent  change  from the 
pre-treatment  values  for the 3 biomarkers using  the Wilcoxon signed  rank test at α = .05.

9. STATISTICAL  METHODS  AND  SAMPLE  SIZE  
DETERMINATION  
9.1 Description of  analysis  sets 
Demographic  and other  baseline  data (including  disease  characteristics)  will be 
summarized  descriptively  for the ITT, safety  and per protocol  populations.  
Categorical  data will be presented  as frequencies  and percentages.  For 
continuous  data,  mean,  standard  deviation,  median,  minimum,  and maximum  
will be presented.  
9.1.1  Evaluable  for response analysis  set 
Consists  of all patients  treated  whom  have  a radiographic  assessment for 
evaluation  by RECIST  v 1.1 following  at least 3 days of treatment.  
 
9.1.2  Safety  analysis  set 
Consists  of all patients  who received  at least one dose  of study  drug and had at least 
one post-baseline  safety  assessment.  
Please  note:  the statement  that a patient  had no adverse  events  (on the Adverse  
Event  CRF)  constitutes  a safety  assessment.  Patients  who have  received  at least 
one dose  of study  drug but who have  no post-treatment  safety  data of any kind would  
be excluded  from the safety population.  
9.2 Methods  of statistical analyses  
Sample  Size Justification.  Historical  data indicate  a median  PFS/time  to progression  of about  
4 months  for newly  diagnosed, advanced -stage  NSCLC  patients  treated  with platinum  doublet  
chemotherapy .11-13,17,18 With a one-sided  significance  level of 0.10,  a total of 51 patients  will 
provide  91% power  (obtained  from PASS  13) to assess  a median  PFS of 4.0 months  against  
a median  PFS of 6.5 months  (HR = 0.615).  It is assumed  that the accrual  time will be 30 
months.  We expect to enroll  75 patients  to have  51 evaluable  subjects.  
 
Statistical  Considerations  for the Primary  Objective.  
PFS.  PFS is  measured  from date first study  treatment  to death,  progression  of disease,  or the 
last follow -up data,  whichever  comes  first. The final analysis  will be undertaken  when  all 
patients  have  been  followed  for at least 6 months.  With our assumptions,  we anticipate  that 
52(64) Clinical Study  Protocol  
Drug Substance AZD1775  
Study  Number  18304  
Edition  Number  5 
Date: August  15, 2019   
 roughly  24 patients  would  have  had an event  at 6 months,  compared  to an expectation  of 33 
events  if AZD1775  wasn’t  part of the treatment  regimen.  The median  survival  will be estimated  
assuming  an exponential  distribution ,19 with patients  not progressing  at one year being  
censored  at that time (3 times  the null hypothesis  median  PFS).  
 
We will test for the exponentiality  of the survival  distribution  using  the RPEXE  fit19   with α = 
0.10.  The exponential  distribution  assumption  will be considered  to hold until the first 
changepoint  identified.  If no changepoint  is identified,  exponentiality  will be considered  to hold 
to the median  follow -up time of censored  cases.  If the exponential  distribution  is found  not to 
hold to at least 8 months  (two times  the null hypothesis  median  survival),  the lower  80% 
confidence  bound  of the Kaplan -Meier  estimated  median  survival  time (which  corresponds  to 
a one-sided  test at α = 0.10)  will be used  to assess  whether  the median  survival  is greater  than 
4.0 months.  
 
 
 
Statistical  Considerations  for the Secondary  Objectives.  
Overall  survival  analysis  (OS).  The median  OS of treated  stage  IV SQCLC  patients  is ~ 10 
months20. The median  OS for patients  treated  with AZD1775  plus carboplatin/paclitaxel  is 
unknown,  but hypothesized  to be greater  than that of patients  treated  with chemotherapy  alone.  
We will be able to estimate  whether  or not this is true by comparing  the median  OS of study  
patients  with the historical  control  value  of 10 months.  The median  survival  will be estimated  
assuming  an exponential  distribution  19  with patients  not progressing  at 2.5 years  being  
censored  at that time  (3 times  the null hypothesis  median  OS). 
 
 
Duration  of response  analysis.  We will also estimate  the duration  of response  using  an 
exponential  distribution  survival  model.19 Disease  control  rates,  DCR,  ORR,  SD, and PR will 
be summarized  appropriately.

required  by law or regulation),  IRB/IEC/REB -approved  informed  consent,  or, if incapable  of 
doing  so, after such  consent  has been  provided  by a legally  acceptable  representative  of the 
patient.  In cases where  the patient’s  representative  gives  consent,  the patient  should  be 
informed  about  the study  to the extent  possible  given  his/her  understanding.  If the patient  is 
capable  of doing  so, he/she  should  indicate  assent  by personally  signing  and dating  the written  
informed  consent  document  or a separate  assent  form.  Informed  consent  must  be obtained  
before  conducting  any study -specific  procedures  (i.e. all of the procedures  described  in the 
protocol).  The process  of obtaining  informed  consent  should  be documented  in the patient  
source  documents.  
Women  of child bearing  potential  should  be informed  that taking  the study  medication  may 
involve  unknown  risks to the fetus  if pregnancy  were  to occur  during  the study  and agree  that 
in order  to participate  in the study  they must  adhere  to the contraception  requirement  for the 
duration  of the study.  If there  is any question  that the patient  will not reliably  comply,  they should  
not be entered  in the study.  
 
 
11.4 Optional  Biopsy  Consent  
Studies  with an optional  biopsy  component  will have  a separate  acknowledgement  covering  
those  studies.  This will be adapted  for each  Study  based  on a standard  template  used  globally  
for all Studies.  The optional  biopsy  informed  consent  will be submitted  for ethical  approval  
together  with the Study  Protocol  and as part of the main  informed  consent  form of the Study.  If

 a subject  opts not to participate  in the optional  biopsy  assessments,  this in no way affects  the 
subject’s  ability  to participate  in the main  research  Study.  
 
 
11.5 Amendments  to the Protocol  
Any change  or addition  to the protocol  can only be made  in a written  protocol  amendment that  
must  be approved  by AstraZeneca,  Health  Authorities  where  required,  and the IRB/IEC/REB.  
Only amendments  that are required  for patient  safety  may be implemented  prior to 
IRB/IEC/REB  approval.  Notwithstanding  the need  for approval  of formal  protocol  amendments,  
the investigator  is expected  to take any immediate  action  required  for the safety of any patient  
included  in this study,  even  if this action  represents  a deviation  from the protocol.  In such  cases,  
AstraZeneca  should  be notified  of this action  and the IRB/IEC/REB  at the study site should  be 
informed  within  10 working  days.  
 
 
 
11.6 Monitoring  
Data  will be captured  in OnCore,  Moffit’s  Clinical Trials  Database.  Regulatory documents  and 
case report  forms  will be monitored  internally  according  to Moffitt Cancer Center Monitoring  
Policies.   Monitoring  will be performed  regularly  to verify  data is accurate,  complete,  and 
verifiable  from source  documents; and  the conduct  of the trial is  in compliance  with the 
currently  approved  protocol/amendments, Good  Clinical Practice  (GCP),  and applicable  
regulatory  requirements. ” 
11.7 Study  Drug Supply  and Resupply,  
Storage, and Tracking/Drug  
Accountability  
Study  drugs  must  be received  by a designated  person  at the study  site, handled  and stored  
safely  and properly,  and kept in a secured  location  to which  only the investigator  and 
designated  assistants  have access.  Upon  receipt,  the AZD1775  should  be stored  according  to 
the instructions  specified  on the drug labels.  Clinical  supplies  are to be dispensed  only in 
accordance  with the protocol.  
Medication  labels  will be in the local language  and comply  with the legal requirements  of each  
country.  They  will include  storage  conditions  for the drug and the medication  number  but no 
information  about the patient.  
The investigator  must  maintain  an accurate  record  of the shipment  and dispensing  of study  
drug in a drug accountability  ledger.  Patients will be asked  to return  all unused  study  drug and 
packaging  at the  end of the study  or at the time of study  drug discontinuation.

15. APPENDIX  A: DISALLOWED  MEDICATIONS  AND  
MEDICATIONS  TO BE ADMINISTERED  WITH CAUTION  
 
Formal  drug-drug interaction  studies  have  not yet been  performed  with AZD1775,  therefore,  
the potential  for drug-drug interaction  described  in this protocol  are based  on findings  from in 
vitro studies  and clinical experience.  
 
In vitro data has shown  that AZD1775  is metabolized  predominantly  by CYP3A4,  with an FMO3  
and/or  FMO5  component.  As a result,  there  is potential  for the exposure  of AZD1775  to be 
effected  by drugs  which  inhibit  or induce  the metabolism  of CYP3A4.  In the clinic,  
coadministration  of AZD1775  with the moderate  CYP3A4  inhibitor,  aprepaitant,  resulted  in a 
60% increase  in the plasma  levels  of AZD1775.  Drugs  known  to be moderate  to strong  
inhibitors/inducers  of CYP3A4  are therefore  prohibited  for use in the current  study,  including  
aprepitant.  
 
In vitro data suggests  that AZD1775  may be a weak  reversible  inhibitor  of CYP2C19  (IC50  12 
uM). Caution  should  therefore  be exercised  when  AZD1775  is coadministered  with agents  that 
are sensitive  substrates  of CYP2C19,  or substrates  of this enzyme  with a narrow  therapeutic  
range.  
 
Based  on in vitro studies,  AZD1775  has been  shown  to be a weak  reversible  inhibitor  (IC50  14 
µM) and a time-dependent  inhibitor  of CYP3A4  (Kinact  0.061/min,  Ki 6.04 µM). The full impact  
of the time dependent  inhibition  is currently  unknown,  however,  modeling  data has predicted  
an 8-10 fold increase  in the exposure  of sensitive CYP3A4  substrates  when administered  with 
AZD1775  (250 mg BID for 5 doses).  To date, no significant  DDI effects  have been  reported  in 
the clinic  that may be related  to the TDI finding.   However,  sensitive  CYP3A4  substrates  or 
59(64) Clinical Study  Protocol  
Drug Substance AZD1775  
Study  Number  
Edition  Number  5 
Date: August  15, 2019   
 substrates  of CYP3A4  with a narrow  therapeutic  window  are prohibited.  
 
AZD1775  has been  shown  to be a weak  inducer  of CYP1A2  in vitro (39%  increase  in activity  
of positive  control).  Given  the nature  of the AZD1775  dosing  schedule,  however,  the risk of 
induction  in the clinic  is considered  low. No specific  precautions  are recommended  at this time,  
except  to be initially  vigilant  when  using  substrates  of CYP1A2  with a narrow  therapeutic  range.  
 
Transporter  studies  (in vitro)  have  shown  that AZD1775  is both a substrate  and inhibitor  
(IC50  20 µM) of P-gp. Maximum  impact  of these  finding  is likely  to occur  for drugs  
administered  orally  at the same  time as AZD1775.  Caution  should  therefore  be exercised  
when agents  that are inhibitors or substrates  of P-gp are administered  concomitantly  with 
AZD1775.  
 
Recent  in vitro transporter  studies  have  shown  AZD1775  to be an inhibitor  of BCRP  (IC50  5.1 
µM). This finding  is particularly  relevant  for drugs  administered  orally  where  exposure  is 
normally  limited  by BCRP -mediated  efflux,  in particular  some  statins.   Modeling  has predicted  
a substantial  increase  in the exposure  of Atorvastatin  when  coadministered  with Clinical  Study  
Protocol Appendix  D Drug  Substance  AZD1775  Study  Code  D6011C00003  Edition  Number 1 
Date  22 October 2014  
 
AZD1775  and the use of Atoravastatin  is therefore  prohibited  in the current  study.  Other drugs  
where  the disposition  is mediated  via BCRP  should  be administered  with caution,  dose  
modification  considered  or substituted  by an alternative  drug.  
 
Use of metformin  is prohibited  in this study  as recent  in vitro transporter  data have  shown  
AZD1775  is an inhibitor  of Multidrug  and Toxin  Extruder  1 (MATE1)  and MATE2K.  Caution  
should  be used  when  administering  drugs  that are substrates  of these  transporters  (e.g. 
cimetidine,  acyclovir,  fexofenadine)  as the clinical  relevance  of AZD1775  inhibition  of the MATE  
pathway  is not known  in these  compounds.  
 
Herbal  preparations/medications  can be substrates,  inhibitors  and inducers,  similar  to any 
registered  medication.  Herbal  preparations  are therefore  not allowed  throughout  the study.  
These  herbal  medications  include,  but are not limited  to: St. John’s  wort,  kava,  ephedra  (ma 
huang),  gingko  biloba,  dehydroepiandrosterone  (DHEA),  yohimbe,  saw palmetto,  and 
ginseng.  
 
In addition,  any other  drugs  should  be avoided  at the Investigator’s  discretion  if, in their 
opinion,  the co-administration  with AZD1775  may increase  the risk of a clinically  significant  
drug interaction.  
 
A list of the main  CYP3A4  substrates,  inhibitors  (strong  and moderate)  and inducers,  
CYP2C19  substrates,  P-gp substrates  and inhibitors  and BCRP  substrates  are shown

 CONFIDENTIAL Page 11 of 27 4 STUDY DESIGN 
4.1 General 
The study is designed as a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized study to assess the 
safety, tolerability, PK, and PD of RJX in healthy participants. This study will be conducted as a 
2-part study. 
4.1.1 Part 1 
Part 1 is designed as single ascending dose (SAD) escalation study in 52 participants in 
6 cohorts. 
• Cohorts 1 to 5 will include 8 participants per cohort (6 RJX: 2 placebo) between 18 and 
50 years of age, inclusive 
• Cohort 6 will investigate an older population of 12 participants 51 to 70 years of age, 
inclusive (9 RJX: 3 placebo) 
The assignment to either RJX or placebo will be blinded to the participants, investigators, and 
study site staff.  
Part 1 will include screening, treatment, and follow-up periods. Screening will be between 
Days -21 and -1 to determine eligibility in the study. Participants who meet the eligibility criteria 
will be admitted to the study site on Day -1, when they will be assessed for continued eligibility.  
Participants will commence a standardized diet the day prior to dosing to control vitamin intake. 
Participants will receive a single dose of investigation product as an IV infusion on Day 1. 
Cohort 1 will include the initial dosing of a sentinel group (1 RJX and 1 placebo). The remaining 
6 participants in Cohort 1 (5 RJX: 1 placebo) will be dosed if, in the opinion of the investigator 
or delegate, there are no significant safety concerns identified in the sentinel participants within 
the first 24 hours after administration of the dose (RJX or placebo). 
Participants will be confined to the study site from Day -1 to Day 2 (24 hours post dose) and then 
required to return to the study site on Day 5 for follow-up. Safety and PK assessments will be 
performed at selected timepoints throughout the study. 
4.1.2 Part 2 
Part 2 of the study is designed as a multiple ascending dose (MAD) escalation study in 
24 participants as 3 cohorts of 8 participants (6 RJX: 2 placebo). The MAD arm will commence 
in parallel with Part 1, Cohort 6 following completion and review of the safety findings for 
Part 1, Cohorts 1 to 5.  
Participants will be randomly assigned to receive 1 of 3 proposed doses of RJX or placebo 
(6 RJX: 2 placebo) daily for 7 days.

 CONFIDENTIAL Page 12 of 27 Part 2 will consist of screening, treatment, and follow-up periods. Screening will occur between 
Days -21 and -1 to determine eligibility in the study. Those participants who meet the eligibility 
criteria will be admitted to the study site on Day -1, when their continued eligibility will be 
assessed. Participants will commence a standardized diet the day prior to dosing to control 
vitamin intake. 
Participants will be confined to the study site from Days -1 to 8 (24 hours post final dose on 
Day 7) and then return to the study site on Day 12 for follow-up. Safety and PK assessments will 
be performed at selected timepoints throughout the study. 
4.1.3 Dose Escalation in Parts 1 and 2 
Details about dose escalation are described in Section 6.3.2 of the study protocol. 
4.2 Study Population 
The study population will include 76 healthy male and female participants between 51 to 
70 years of age (Part 1, Cohort 6) or 18 and 50 years of age (all other cohorts), inclusive, with a 
body mass index (BMI) of 18 to 35 kg/m2, weight not exceeding 132 kg, negative serology and 
drug and alcohol testing, and clinical laboratory test results within normal reference range or 
judged to be not clinically significant. 
4.3 Evaluations at Screening and Check-in 
A detailed schedule of events is provided in Table 6 (for Part 1) and Table 7 (for Part 2) in 
Section 8.1 of the study protocol. 
4.4 Randomization and Treatment Assignments 
Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either RJX or placebo.  
A computer-generated randomization schedule and kit list will be prepared prior to the start of 
the study. Investigational product will be prepared and dispensed in accordance with the 
randomization schedule and kit list. The master randomization schedule and kit list will be made 
of randomly permuted blocks of appropriate sizes, as determined by the unblinded study team 
member producing the schedules. The schedules will be generated through the Statistical 
Analysis System software, version 9.3. 
After signing the informed consent form (ICF), each participant will be given a unique screening 
number according to the screening order. Then, prior to dosing, each participant will be allocated 
a randomization number according to their chronological order of inclusion in the study. This 
number will correspond to a treatment (RJX or placebo) as specified on the pre-determined 
randomization schedule. 
Confirmation of the randomization number allocated will be documented in the drug 
accountability records and recorded in the eCRF. Both the screening and randomization numbers

respectively. 
4.4.2 Concomitant Medications 
Should any treatment/medication other than the investigational product be used, the investigator 
must note the use of the concomitant medication in the source documentation and the CRF. This 
record should include the drug name (generic name), total daily dose, route of administration, 
start and stop date of administration, and the indication. 
Concomitant medications will be recorded from Day -1 throughout the study for both study 
parts. 
4.4.3 Compliance 
Investigational product will be administered via IV by study site staff. 
Every attempt will be made to select participants who have the ability to understand and comply 
with instructions. Noncompliant participants may be discontinued from the study. The time and 
day of investigational product administration will be recorded. Drug accountability records will 
be maintained by the study site. 
4.5 Evaluation of Treatment Safety 
4.5.1 Adverse Events 
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence, in a clinical study participant 
administered a medicinal product, that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this 
treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of the medicinal 
(investigational) product, whether or not it is related to the medicinal (investigational) product. 
This includes an exacerbation of pre-existing conditions or events, intercurrent illnesses, drug 
interaction, or the significant worsening of the indication under investigation that is not recorded 
elsewhere in the eCRF under specific efficacy assessments. Assessment of AEs starts with 
signing informed consent. 
It is the responsibility of the investigator to document all AEs that occur during the study. The 
AEs will be elicited by asking the participant a nonleading question, for example, “Have you 
experienced any new or changed symptoms since we last asked/since your last visit?” The AEs 
should be reported on the appropriate page of the eCRF. 
4.5.2 Clinical Laboratory Assessments 
The laboratory safety tests to be analyzed are described in more detail in Section 7.1.7 of the 
study protocol.

 CONFIDENTIAL Page 15 of 27 4.5.3 Vital Signs 
Daily vital signs (screening, check-in, and follow-up; also refer to Protocol Appendix 1, Tables 6 
and 7 Error! Reference source not found.) measurements will include body temperature, 
r
espiratory rate, heart rate, and systolic and diastolic blood pressure.  
4.5.4 Safety Electrocardiograms 
A safety 12-lead ECG will be performed after the patient has rested comfortably in the supine or 
semi-supine position for at least 5 minutes.  
The following parameters will be assessed: heart rate, PR, QRS, QT, and QTcF (Fridericia’s 
formula). The investigator (or a qualified observer at the investigational site) will interpret the 
ECG using one of the following categories: within normal limits, abnormal but not clinically 
significant, or abnormal and clinically significant. 
In Part 1, a safety 12-lead ECG will be performed at every visit except follow-up. In Part 2, a 
safety 12-lead ECG will be performed at every visit except check-in (refer to Protocol 
Appendix 1, Tables 6 and 7 Error! Reference source not found.). 
4
.5.5 Physical and Neurological Examinations 
Full physical examinations will be performed at screening and follow-up by a physician or a 
clinically qualified delegate at the site. The physical examination will include examination of the 
following: general appearance, head, ears, eyes, nose, throat, neck (including thyroid), skin, 
cardiovascular system, respiratory system, gastrointestinal system, musculoskeletal system, 
lymph nodes, and nervous system. Any findings made during the physical examination must be 
noted regardless of whether they are part of the patient’s medical history. An abbreviated 
physical examination will be performed at check-in. 
Daily neurological assessments per standard of care will include pyramidal functions, limb 
strength, cerebellar functions, and sensory functions. 
4.5.6 Weight and Height 
Body weight (in kg; wearing light clothes, no shoes) and height (in cm) will be measured. Height 
and weight measurements will be used to calculate body mass index (BMI). 
4.5.7 Protocol Deviation Reporting 
If any issue relating to the safety of study participant arises that requires a deviation from the 
protocol, the study unit through the investigator may immediately make such a deviation. The 
nature and reasons for the protocol deviations/violations will be recorded in the participant’s 
eCRF. All protocol deviations/violations will be captured by the study unit. Failure to obtain 
samples due to clinical issues, such as problems with venous access, will not be considered 
protocol violations. Changes in dose levels or the implementation of additional cohorts as 
directed by the SRC will not be considered protocol deviations.

and data deviations captured on the case report form (CRF) and found through programming and 
examining the database will be listed by participant. 
4.6 Pharmacodynamic Assessments 
The PD of RJX will be assessed by changes from baseline in blood pH, blood bicarbonate 
urinary pH, and exploratory biomarkers. 
4.6.1 Blood pH, Bicarbonate, and Biomarkers 
Blood samples collected for the evaluation of pH, bicarbonate, and biomarkers including:  
ICAM-1, VCAM-1, hsCRP, and IL-6 will be collected for Part 1 cohort 6 and Part 2 as specified 
in Protocol Appendix 2. 
The PD blood samples can be collected at the same time as the PK sample where timepoints 
coincide. The sample required for the PD assessment will be aliquoted into separate PD tubes. 
Additional details on the collection of PD blood samples are included in the Laboratory 
Procedures Manual. 
4.6.2 Urinary pH 
In Part 1 and Part 2, the pH of RJX will be evaluated in urine. The urine sample will be collected 
prior to infusion and at the first voluntary void post the end of infusion to evaluate urine pH and 
exploratory biomarkers. Additional details on the collection of PD urine samples are included in 
the Laboratory Procedures Manual.

listings will be sorted by part, treatment, participant identification, and timepoint.  
Categorical data will be summarized by both participant and timepoint. Participant data will be 
summarized using the count of distinct participants who fall into the category and the percentage 
of the total number of participants. Timepoint data will be summarized using the count of the 
assessments that fall into the category and the percentage of the total number of assessments. 
Percentages will be rounded up or down to the next integer percentage. Population counts (either 
number of participants or number of timepoints at the assessment) for each treatment group will 
be used as the denominator in the calculation of percentages unless otherwise specified. 
7.2 Handling of Dropouts or Missing Data 
All data from withdrawn participants will be included in all analyses up to the time of 
withdrawal regardless of the duration of treatment. There will be no imputation for missing data 
unless otherwise specified. 
7.3 Multicenter Studies 
This is a single-center study. 
7.4 Examination of Subgroups 
No subgroup analyses are planned. 
7.5 Analysis Populations 
Intent to Treat (ITT) Population: all randomized participants based on the randomized treatment, 
regardless of which treatment the participant actually received; used for all summaries of 
baseline and demographic data; all associated listings will be produced for the ITT population 
Safety Analysis Population: participants who received at least 1 dose of the investigational 
product (RJX or placebo); used for all summaries of baseline, demographic data, safety data and

provided at least one quantifiable plasma concentration of cyanocobalamin, ascorbic acid, 
thiamine, magnesium or niacinamide. 
PK Evaluable Analysis Set: participants who received at least one dose of the investigational 
product for whom at least one estimable PK parameter could be reliably estimated. 
The following analysis population is also defined in the clinical study protocol:  
• QT/QTc Analysis Set 
This analysis population will not be defined in this SAP, since the QT/QTc analyses will be 
prepared by ERT.  
7.6 Participant Accountability 
Summaries of analysis populations and participant disposition will be presented by treatment and 
overall using ITT Population for each part separately and will contain the following information: 
• Number and percent of participants who were randomized 
• Number and percent of participants who were dosed and received treatment 
• Number and percent of participants who received all doses planned (Part 2 only) 
• Number and percent of participants who completed the study 
• Number and percent of participants who discontinued early and reason for early 
discontinuation 
• Number and percent of participants in each population 
Participant enrollment and disposition, including reasons for early withdrawal from the study, 
will be summarized by treatment. Participant disposition will be presented in listings. 
7.7 Protocol Deviation Reporting 
Protocol deviations identified by the clinical research associate during monitoring visits and 
deviations captured on the CRF and identified through programming and examining the database 
will be listed by participant. 
7.8 Participant Demographics and Baseline Characteristics 
Summaries of baseline and demographic characteristics will be based on the ITT Population as 
well as Safety Analysis Set. Baseline and demographic data (including gender, age, race, 
ethnicity, weight, height, and BMI) will be summarized by treatment.  
7.9 Dose Proportionality Analysis  
The dose proportionality of the main PK parameters C max, AUC 0-last (SAD), AUC tau (MAD), and 
AUC 0-inf (SAD and MAD) will be investigated using the following power model:

 CONFIDENTIAL Page 21 of 27 log(parameter) = a + b * log(dose), where a is the intercept, b is the slope and dose is the actual 
dose in mL/kg. 
Each log-transformed PK parameter for the RJX components cyanocobalamin, ascorbic acid, 
thiamine, magnesium and niacinamide will be fitted to a power model with fixed effect term for 
log-transformed dose and subjects as random effects. For each PK parameter, the slope and 
associated 90% CI will be presented. If the 90% CI for the slope of the regression line contains 1 
then it can be concluded that the PK parameter is dose proportional. 
Dose proportionality may be assessed within different dose ranges if deemed appropriate. All 
dose proportionality assessments will include data from at least three dose levels. 
Scatterplots including regression line for all PK parameters of all analytes versus dose in mg will 
be generated. 
7.10 Analysis of Safety Data 
7.10.1  General 
Safety parameters will be listed and summarized using standard descriptive statistics for values 
for each treatment at each timepoint as well as changes from baseline of each cohort separately.  
7.10.2  Adverse Events 
All investigational product and protocol procedure AEs will be listed, and if the frequency of 
events allows, safety data (Aes) will be summarized using descriptive methodology.  
The incidence of symptoms for each treatment will be presented by severity and association with 
investigational product, as perceived by the investigator. Symptoms reported to occur prior to 
enrollment will be distinguished from those reported as new or increased in severity during the 
study. Each symptom will be classified by the most suitable term from the Medical Dictionary 
for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA).  
The Aes will be grouped by MedDRA system organ class (SOC) and preferred term (PT) and 
summarized by actual treatment/dose level.  
Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) are defined as Aes that commence on or after the 
time of start of first investigational product administration.  
All TEAEs will be summarized by actual treatment/dose level. The number and percentage of 
participants experiencing Aes and the number of TEAEs will be tabulated. The following 
summaries will be presented:  
• Overall summary of TEAEs 
• All TEAES by SOC and PT 
• All TEAEs by SOC, PT, and severity

• SAEs by SOC and PT 
Any SAEs, Aes with outcome of death, or Aes resulting in discontinuation of study or IP will be 
listed separately. A separate summary table of adverse events of interest will be tabulated for 
neurological and infusion related events. 
7.10.3  Clinical Laboratory Assessments 
Observed values and actual changes from baseline (defined as last value prior to first IMP 
administration) of continuous laboratory parameters (hematology and clinical chemistry) will be 
summarized descriptively, by actual treatment/dose level, and visit/timepoint. Categorical 
outcomes will be summarized by frequency tables. Shift tables representing categorical change 
of laboratory results from baseline to each post-baseline visit will be presented. Urinalysis results 
will be summarized at each timepoint by actual treatment/dose level at each timepoint using 
frequency tables. Pregnancy and infertility related data will be listed. Lab normal ranges will also 
be listed. 
7.10.4  Vital Signs 
Observed values and actual changes from baseline (defined as last value prior to first IMP 
administration) of vital signs will be summarized descriptively by actual treatment/dose level and 
visit/timepoint. Categorical outcomes will be summarized by frequency tables. 
7.10.5  Safety Electrocardiograms 
Observed values and actual changes from baseline (defined as last value prior to first IMP 
administration) of ECG parameters will be summarized descriptively by actual treatment/dose 
level and visit/timepoint. Safety 12-lead ECG interpretations (categorical outcomes) will be 
summarized by frequency tables. 
7.10.6  Physical and Neurological Examinations 
Physical examination data as well as neurological examination data will be listed only. 
7.10.7  Concomitant Medications 
Prior medications are those medications that were stopped prior to first dose of investigational 
product. Concomitant medications are medications taken at least once after investigational 
product. Medications stopped on the same day as investigational product will be considered prior 
medications.  
Prior and concomitant medications will be listed. Concomitant medication summary tables will 
be grouped by PT and show the number and percentage of participants by PT for all participants 
overall. For the summaries of concomitant medications, participants who take the same 
medication (in terms of the PT) more than once will only be counted once for that medication.

Pharmacodynamic parameters like blood bicarbonate and pH, urinary pH, and relevant 
exploratory biomarkers (Part 1 cohort 6 and Part 2 only) will be summarized at each timepoint 
by actual treatment and each dose level by using descriptive statistics, unless results are 
categorical. Categorical outcomes will be summarized by frequency tables (see section 9.1). Data 
will be assessed for clinical safety and clinical significant changes from baseline and additional 
statistical analyses and interpretations may be added in an amendment. 
7.12 Sample Size 
The sample size for this study has been selected without performing a formal sample size 
calculation. The sample size was chosen empirically and is customary for Phase 1 studies 
evaluating safety and PK parameters; it is not based on statistical hypothesis testing. 
7.13 Interim Analysis 
The SRC will review the safety data and PK data (only safety data in Cohorts 1 and 2 in Part 1) 
prior to escalation to the next cohort for both parts of the study. The safety and PK findings of 
the Part 1 (SAD) Cohorts 1 to 5 will be reviewed by the SRC prior to commencing Part 2 
(MAD). 
7.14 General Conventions for Tables, Listings and Figures  
For summary tables, unless otherwise specified, the number of decimal places provided in the 
SAS output will be based on the accuracy of the least accurate value in the raw data as follows:

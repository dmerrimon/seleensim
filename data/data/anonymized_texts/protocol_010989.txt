III. STUDY INF ORMATION  
 
• Study Design Abstract  
 
Study rationale :  
 
Control of postoperative analgesia has become a major topic in surgical awareness and it plays 
a crucial role in patient satisfaction  and outcome .1,2 Breast reconstruction is associated with 
postoperative  pain, which can result in  patient discomfort, patient dissatisfaction, and 
unanticipated/extended hospital admission  when  undermanaged.2-4 Opioids  continue to play an 
important role in postoperative pain management.5 However, their use concerns patients  and 
physicians, since their  side effect s (e.g. nausea/vomiting, pruritus, sedation, 
respiratory/cardiovascular depression) can become  detrimental to patient recovery . 2,5 
 
Long lasting local anesthetics  (bupivicaine HCl ) have  become a useful to ol to reduce 
postoperative pain and cumulative narcotics  usage  in breast reconstruction patients .2-4 
However, because bupivacaine HCl is only effective for a brief period of time (3 -7 hours)6, 
postoperative pain c ontrol is then mostly achieved by intermittently adminis trating bupivacaine 
HCl through an indwelling  catheter ( ON Q pump) into the surgical site.2-4 This therapeutic  
modality  has several disadvantages: 1) patient s must leave hospital  with the device; 2 ) catheter 
can become dislodged; 3) seroma formation  can o ccur; and 4) potential infection s through the 
introduction of skin flora into a sterile pocket.7,8 In contrast  to bupivica ine HCl , liposomal 
bupivacaine ; Exparel®; Pacira Pharmaceuticals, San Diego, CA ) has demonstrated a decrease  
in the  use of rescue opio id analgesics  and longer lasting postoperative  pain control .9-11 
Therefore , in the breast reconstruction patient population, liposomal bupivacaine long -lasting 
effect not only allows us to treat postoperative pain without  the need of a local anesthetic 
infusion pump, but also reduce postoperative  opioid use .  
 We believe that subject s undergoing breast reconstruction with tissue expander will achieve 
greater control of pain and longer lasting analgesia with the use of liposomal bupivacaine compared to bupivicaine HC l. Consequently, the group managed with liposomal bupivacaine  
will have less of a need  for rescue analgesic medications , fewer narcotic adverse events (e.g. 
nausea/vomiting) , and shorter hospital  stays than subjects treated with bupivacaine HCl. W e 
strongly believe that this study will be of great inte rest to the plastic and reconstructive sur gery 
7/9/2014   5 community, because it can  significantly  influence  what may soon be considered ‘standard of 
care’ in  this patient population.  
 
Objectives /Rationale/Hypot hesis   
 
 
Objective 1:  
 
Evaluate the effectiveness of DepoFoam Bupivicaine (Exparel®) to reduce postoperative 
pain in breast reconstruction patients compared to the current standard treatment 
(bupivacaine HCl).  
 
We will assess pain utilizing methods that h ave been successfully employed in studies w ith 
similar experimental design .9-13 Pain will be assessed  qualitatively through the use of : 1) 
numeric rating scale during rest (NRS -R) and activity (NRS -A), 2) brief pain inventory (BPI) 
questionnaire, and 3) postoperative analgesia patient satisfaction scale.   
 
The nume ric rating scale of pain (NRS) will consist of an 11 point scale .  The end points are 
extremes of pain:  no pain (NRS=0)  and worst possible pain (NRS=10) (Appendix 1, Figure 1). 
We will also utiliz e the brief pain inventory  (BPI) questionnaire to assess the patient’s  quality 
of life  after surgery  (Appendix 2) .  The BPI measures both the intensity of pain (sensory 
dimension) and interference of pain in the patient's life.  This questionnaire assesses  pain relief, 
pain quality, and patient perception of the cause of pain (Appendix  2).14 Furthermore, 
postoperative analgesia satisfaction will be recorded through a 5- point scale (0= very 
unsatisfied to 5=  very satisfied) ( Appendix 1, Figure 2).    
 
Rationale:  
 
There is no current  literature evaluating the effectiveness of DepoFoam Bupivicaine 
(Exparel®) in reducing postoperative pain in breast reconstruction patients compared to the 
current standard treatment (bupivacaine HCl).  
 
Hypothesis:  
 
We hypothesi ze that patients undergoing breast reconstruction with tissue expander will 
achieve greater control of post -operative pain and longer lasting analgesia with the use of 
liposomal bupivacaine . 
 
7/9/2014   6  
   
Objective 2:  
 
Evaluate and c ompare  the usage of opiate rescue pain medications between the 
experimental ( liposomal bupivacaine ) and historical control  (bupivacaine HCl)  groups .  
 
Given the subjective nature behind pain assessment, we will record the use of rescue analgesics 
for each patient. This part of the study  will provide  quantitative data that we can then use in 
comparison to the qualitative measurements (NSR, BPI, patient satisfaction scale rate) . In turn, 
this will allow us  to objectify  patient’s pain , thereby  increasing  the validity of our results. More 
importantly, this aspect of the investigation will enable us to study the impact that liposomal bupivacaine  has in reducing the postoperative usage of opi oid medication s in this patient 
population. 
 
Rationale:  
 
There are no studies evaluating the effectiven ess of liposomal bupivacaine in  reducing the 
usage of opioid analgesics  in breast reconstruction patients compared to the current standard 
treatment (bupivacaine HCl).  
 
Hypothesis:  
 
Patients managed with liposomal bupivacaine will have  a reduced need for  opioid medication  
management compared to subjects treated with bupivacaine HCl.  
 
Design of Study:  
 The pilot study will be a prospe ctive.  
 
Inclusion Criteria  
 
All eligible patients , 18 and over , undergo breast reconstruction with tissue expanders
. 
 
 
Excl usion Criteria  
 
Exclusion criteria include the following patient  populations: 1) history of adverse reaction to 
local anesthesia; 2) chronic liver disease; 3) history of chronic preoperative consumption of 
narcotics or opioids ; 4) history of alcohol and/or  illicit drug dependence ; 5) undergoing 
7/9/2014   7 combined procedures; 6 ) diagnosed with neuromuscular/neurosensory  disorder; 7) positive 
pregnancy  test; 8) previous  breast conservation therapy (lumpectomy with radiation treatment; 
9) previous surgeries  or trauma  in the breast or chest region  (dener vation may bias pain 
perception); 10) axillary node dissection;  and 11) psychosis.  
 
Screening Visit  
 
Screening procedure will be performed within 30 days of the patient’s scheduled procedure.  
During s creening visit: 1) informed consent will be obtained;  2) stud y eligibility will be 
confirmed; 3) evaluation will be performed (i.e. medical/surgical history, physical exam,  vital 
signs , drug/alcohol scre ening, and clinical laboratory);  and 4) patient will be trained on the pa in 
assessment tools  that will be  used in  the study.  
 
Preoperative  
 
Preoperative evaluation will be performed prior to the operation (e.g. eligibility reconfi rmation, 
review of history, vital signs , physical exam , urine pregnancy test ). Furthermore, patien t’s 
baseline pain intensity will be assessed at this time.  Pain intensity at both rest and with activity 
will be assessed using the numeric rating scale (NRS -R & NRS -A; 0= no pain & 10= worst 
possible pain, respectively). When assessing NRS -A pain intensit y, we will ask the patient to 
raise both arms above the head and hold for five seconds.  Patient will be randomly assigned to 
either receive Depofoam bupivacaine (266mg  per side) or bupivacaine HCl (2 .5mg/kg) in a 1:1 
ratio. Randomization and allocation of  the subjects chosen to be placed into the experimental 
group (DepoFoam bupivacaine)  or control group  (bupivicaine HCl) will be generated via a  
computer randomization system. (Note: A standard final dilution of the drugs will be 
established among the co -investigators prior to initiating the study).  
 
Intraopera tive 
 
General Anesthesia Protocol : 
 
All eligible patients will receive the same anesthetic plan to minimize the incidence of 
postoperative nausea and vomiting:  
1. Premedication with midazolam  
2. Administration of decadron at induction to prevent nausea and vomiting 
7/9/2014   8 3. Induction with propofol and alfentanyl, muscle relaxation with succinycholine, 
rocuronium or atracurium  
4. Anesthesia maintenance with propofol, alfentanyl, nitrous oxide , and oxygen 
5. Anesthesia revers al with neostigmine and glycopyrolate  
6. Dolasentron to be given within 30 minutes of emergence  
 
 
Local Anesthetics Protocol: ( Depofoam bupivacaine  & Bupivicaine  HCl)  
 
The study drug s will be administer ed into the right and/or left  breast  of each patient  30 m inutes 
prior to the creation of the subpectoral  muscle  pocket (where tissue expanders will be placed).   
 The l ocal anesthetic will be administered using a “field block”  approach . The patient  will be in 
supine position, with each arm  abducted at the shoulde r and placed on an arm board. We will 
administer  the drug with a 10 or 20 ml  syringe and 22- or 25- gauge. The local anesthetic will 
be locally infiltrated into the pocket (where implants are placed) and  around the  perimeter  of 
the surgical site, including the drain sites.  We will be infiltrating the drugs to soft tissue, chest 
wall and muscles. Because several surgeons will be involved in this study, we will develop a 
standardized protocol for administering the local a nesthetic;  not only  this will reduce an y 
potential confounding factors, but also will enable us to be consistent. Patients from surgeons that are not part of the study may be enrolled as long as the surgeon is familiarized with the 
protocol, agrees with it, and one of the co- investigators is pr esent during the research related 
procedures to assure compliance.  
 
Postoperative  
 
Pain Assessment  
 
We will assess pain utilizing methods that have been successfully employed in studies with 
similar experimental design.
9-13 Subjective evaluation of pain wi ll be recorded on a Patient Data 
Collection Sheet . It will be performed by using numeric  rating scale  (Appendix 1; Table 1, 
Figure 1 ). Pain intensity at rest and with activity will be assessed using the numeric rating sc ale 
(NRS -R & NRS -A; 0= no pain & 10= worst possible pain, respectively ). When assessing NRS -
A pain intensity, we will ask the patient to raise both arms above the head and hold for five 
seconds. NRS -R and NRS -A pain intensity assessment will be recorded at  one, four, eight, 12, 
24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84, an d 96 hour time periods after the adminis tration  of the local anesthetic . 
Also patient’s qualit y of life will be assessed by asking her to complete the Brief Pain 
7/9/2014   9 Inventory  (BPI) questionnaire at 24, 48, 72, and 96 hours  (Appendix  2). Furthermor e, patient 
postoperative analgesia satisfaction will also be rated  through the use of a 5- point categorical 
scale (0=very unsatisfied and 5=very satisfied) at 96  hours after local anesthetic administratio n 
(Appendix 1, Table 4).   
 
Objective evaluation of pain will be accomplished  by assessing the amount and type of rescue 
analgesics used during hospitalization  and post -operative days 1 through 4. This will be 
evaluated through nursing records available in  our electronic medical record  (EPIC ; Verona, 
Wiscons in) that will be transferred to a Patient Data C ollection Sheet (Appendix 1) . During the 
hospitalization, for postoperative rescue analgesics , patients will have the following available : 
1) acetaminophen 650mg (Tylenol)  every 4 -6 hours as needed  for mild p ain (pain scale 1 -3), 2) 
oxycodone 5mg/  acetaminophen 325 mg  (Percocet)  or hydrocodone 5 mg/ acetaminophen 300 
mg (Norco)  every 4 -6 hours as needed , for m oderate pain  (pain scale 4 -6), and 3)  IV opioid 
analgesics  (e.g. Dilaudid, Fentanyl, or Morphine) ever y 4-6 hours as needed , for severe pain 
(pain scale 7-10). Patient will be discharged with  a standardized oral pain medication regimen , 
which will consists of  1) acetaminophen 650mg  and 2) oxycodone 5mg/acetaminophen 325 mg 
(Percocet) or hydrocodone 5 mg/ a cetaminophen 300 mg  every  4-6 hours as needed .  
 
Typically, patients undergoing this procedure are  discharged  from the hospital  once tolerating  
oral pain medications , and no longer requiring  IV rescue analgesics. Patients that are getting 
discharged will receive a similar Patient Data Collection Sheet  used during their hospitalization 
to record their pain, use of rescue analgesics , and adverse events  at the remaining time points. 
For example, if patient is discharged after 24 hours , we will have already assess ed and recorded  
patient’s data  as explained ab ove at 1, 4, 8, 12, and 24 hour intervals . Then, we will ask  the 
patient to record at home  for the remaining intervals : 1) NRS -A and NRS -R at 36, 48, 60, 72, 
84, and 96 hours after drug administration;  2) rescue analgesics intake at 36, 48, 60, 72, 84, and 
96 hours after drug administration; 3) adverse events at  36, 48, 60, 72, 84, and 96 hours after 
drug administration; 3) BPI at 24, 48, 72, and 96 hours  after drug administration; and 4 ) 5-point 
categorical scale at 96  hours  (Appendix 1, 2). Patients will be seen at the Plastic Surgery office 
for their postoperative visit, usually within 7 to 14 days after surgery.  
 
Adverse Events:  
 
    The following adverse events will be evaluated: 1) nausea; 2) vomiting; 3) constipation; 4)         so mnolence; 5) dizziness; 6) respiratory distress. They will be assessed at 1, 4, 8, 12, 24, 36,    
7/9/2014   10     48, 60, 72, 84, and 96 hours after the administration of the local anesthetics and recorded in    
    the Patient Data Colle ction Sheet (Appendix 1, Table 3).  
 
   
 
Summary of Methods:  
 Historical Comparator /Control  
 
The comparator/ control of the  study will be bupivicaine HCl ( Marcaine 0.5% with epinephrine 
1:200,000). We  are interested in utilizing bupivicaine HCl as the contr ol because: 1) it has been 
shown to reduce pain scores  and cumulative pain medications in breast reconstruction patients
2-
4 and 2) the use of local anesthe sia for reduction of postoperative analgesia following a breast 
reconstruction with tissue expander i s a standard of treatment at our institution.  
 
Secondary Endpoints  
 The s econdary endpoints of this study will be : 1) adverse events (i.e. nausea/vomiting , 
somnolence, dizziness, constipation, respiratory distress ); 2) overall patient satisfaction; 3) 
length of hospital stay.  
 
Predictive Variables:  
 
The predictive variables will include: 1) demographics (e.g. age, race/ethnicity, weight/BMI ); 
2) unilateral/bilateral breast reconstruction; 3) sentinel lymph node biopsy ; 4) 
therapeutic/prophylactic mastecto my; 5) use of acellular  dermal matrix  (ADM)  for 
reconstruction of the lateral & inferior mamma ry fold (partial submuscular pocket with ADM); 
6)  elevation of the serratus anterior (complete submuscular pocket); 7) volume of saline in the 
tissue expander.  
 
Expected Results  
 
We hypothesize that patients undergoing breast reconstruction with tissue expander will achieve greater control of post -operative pain and longer lasting analgesia with the use of 
DepoFoam bupivacaine compared to bupivicaine HCl. Conseque ntly, patients managed with 
DepoFoam bupivacaine will have lower use of opioid rescue medication, fewer narcotic 
adverse events, and shorter hospital stay than subjects treated with bupivacaine HCl.  
 
7/9/2014   11 Outcome Assessment  
 
Statistical analysis will be conduc ted on Stata 11.0 (College Station, TX). Patients will be 
randomly divided into an experimental and control group. Primary and secondary outcomes 
will be recorded.  
 Patient population demographics in the two groups will be compared by Fisher’s exact test 
for nominal variables and Student t -test for quantitative variables. This will ensure that 
conclusions are not due to varying patient populations. Univariate analysis comparing primary outcome measur es for both groups will be performed using Mann- Whitney t est 
given expected non- normal distribution of values. The same will be done for secondary end 
points. Finally, exploratory  multivaria ble regression analys es for each primary end point will 
be performed to control for the effect of differences in baseline variables between treatment 
groups on primary endpoint outcomes and avoid erroneous conclusions due to confounding; 
this will also enable us to evaluate if use of DepoFoam bupivicaine  was an independent 
predictor of the primary and secondary outcomes of thi s study.   Continuous measures will 
be compared using linear regression techniques, while, if feasible, categorical outcomes will be evaluated using generalized linear models including logistic regression and Poisson 
regression as appropriate.  If necessar y, transformations of outcome measures will be 
performed prior to analysis to meet model assumptions.  Analyses will be performed 
assuming a 0.05 significance level.  
 
• Therapeutics to B e Studied:  
 
1) Liposomal bupivacaine [b upivacaine extended -release lipo some injection , (Exparel® )] 
     2) Bupivicaine HCl ( Marcaine)  
 
• Pathology and Disease to be Studied and Incidence:  No disease or pathology will be studied or treated in this investigation. We will be studying       
    the effectiveness of local anestheti cs (liposomal bupivacaine  & bupivacaine  HCl ) in post -  
    operative analgesia, following bilateral breast reconstruction with tissue expander.  
 
• Number of Study Subjects/Animals:  
As this is a pilot study , a sample size of 50 total patients (25 per treatmen t group)  is planned. 
The goal is to have 25 completed patients in each group. Patients that for some reason did 
not complete the post -operative pain assessment will be replaced.     This  sample size should 
7/9/2014   12 provide estimates of potential effect sizes and var iability in the present setting to allow for 
future study planning.  In keeping with recommendations from Cocks et al15, if the 
variability is similar to what was observed in Smoot et al10, then this study should provide 
adequate evidence of whether pain d ecreases of 15% or more are unlikely in this setting.  
 
 
• Dosage Regimen : 
   Local Anesthetics:

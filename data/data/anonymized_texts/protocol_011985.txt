Page 6 Exploratory  Objectives:  
1. To explore the  concentration -corrected QT (QTc) relationships of 
U3-1402, total anti -HER3 antibody, and MAAA -1181a . 
2. To identify biomarkers that correlate with U3-1402 response or 
toxicity . 
Study Design:  This is a Phase 1/2, multicenter, open -label, multiple dose, 
first-in-human study of U3 -1402 in subjects with HER3 -positive 
advance d/unresectable or metastatic breast cancer.   This study consists 
of 3 parts:  Dose Escalation, Do se Finding, and Dose Expansion.  
In the Dose Escalation  Part, eligible subjects with HER3 -high breast 
cancer who have been refractory to or intolera nt to standard treatment, 
or for whom standard treatment is no longer available, will be 
enrolled.  
In the Dose Finding  Part, eligible subjects with HER3 -high breast 
cancer who have received ≥ 2 and ≤6 pri or chemotherapy regimens 
(including ≥ 2 regimens given in the  advanced disease  setting ) will be 
enrolled.  
In the Dose Expansion  Part, eligible subjects with HER3 -positive , 
HER2 -negative , HR-positive  breast cancer  who have received ≥2 and 
≤6 prior chemotherapy regimens  for breas t cancer  (including 
≥2 regimens  administered for the treatment of advanced /unresectable 
or metastatic  disease ), and eligible subjects with HER3 -high TNBC 
who have received  1 to 2 prior chemotherapy regimens in the 
advanced disease setting will be enrolled . 
Dose Escalation Part  
Beginning with Cycle 1, Day 1, U3 -1402 will be administered via 
intravenous (IV) infusion once every 3 weeks (Q3W), in 21 -day 
cycles. The treatment wi ll continue  until unacceptable toxicity, 
progressive disease (PD), or withdrawal of consent. The starting dose 
for the Dose Escalation Part will be 1.6 mg/kg.  
Dose escalation will be guided by the modified Continuous 
Reassessment Method (mCRM) using a Bayesian logistic regression 
model (BLRM) following the escalation with overdose control 
(EWOC) principle. In this method, a decision to escalate to the next 
dose cohort will be based on review of all subjects who have 
completed the dose -limiting to xicity (DLT) evaluation period.  
This DLT evaluation period is defined as the 21 days of Cycle 1. A 
DLT -evaluable subject is defined as any subject who has received at 
least one dose of U3-1402 , with the exception of those subjects for 
whom DLT evaluation could not be adequately conducted.  
The second subject in each dosing level should receive dosing at least 
24 hours after the initial dosing of the first subject . This allo ws to 
check for acute toxicity such as an infusion -related reaction.  
The Dose Escalation Part will be conducted in Japan  only. 
Dose Finding  Part  
During the Dose Finding  Part, subjects will be assigne d into cohorts  
with multiple drug administration schedules, including up -titration of 
dose.   The objectives of the Dose Finding Part are to assess safety and

3 cycles as described below:  
o Cycle 1, Day 1:  3.2 mg/kg  
o Cycle 2, Day 1:  4.8 mg/kg  
o Cycle 3, Day 1 and subsequent cycles:  6.4 mg/kg  
Dose Finding Cohort 4  
 U3-1402 administered via IV infusion at a dosage of 
4.2 mg/kg Q2W in 14 -day cycles for  3 cycles, followed by a 
dosage of 6.4  mg/kg administered via IV infusion Q3W  
thereafter.  
Dose Finding Cohort 5  
 U3-1402 administered via IV infusion at a dosage of 
3.2 mg/kg Q2W in 14 -day cycles for 3 cycles , followed by a 
dosage of 4.8  mg/kg administered via IV infusion Q3W  
thereafter.  
 
Additional Dose Finding Cohort s 
 Additional dose levels equal to, or less than, the MTD (if 
attained or highest dose evaluated during the Dose Escalation 
Part)  may be considered for the Dose Finding Part . 
 Additional dose reg imens, including up -titration of dose , may 
be considered for the Dose Finding Part based on emerging 
safety and efficacy data . 
Dose Expansion Part  
In the Dose Expansion  Part, subjects will be assigned to  cohorts as 
described below. The objectives of the Dose Expansion Part are to 
assess  safety and evaluate efficacy  of U3-1402 at the RDEs in subjects 
with HER3 -positive , HER2 -negative  (including HR -positive and 
TNBC) advanced /unresectable or metastatic breast cancers.  The Dose 
Expansion Part may include su bjects from any participating country, 
including the United States  (US)  and Japan.

finding may be considered upon review of human safety and PK 
parameters by the Investigators and Sponsor.  
Study Endpoints:  Pharmacokinetic endpoints:  
Serum PK endpoints (area under the concentration -versus -time curve, 
from time 0 to the last measurable concentration as calculated by the 
linear -up log -down trapezoidal method [AUClast], AUC during 
dosing interval [AUCtau], maximum (peak) observed concentration 
[Cmax], time of maximum observed concentration [Tmax] and trough 
serum concentrations [Ctrough]) of U3 -1402 for each subject will be 
estimated using standard noncompartmental methods.  For total anti -
HER3 antibody and MAAA -1181a , all parameters l isted above will be 
estimated.  
Safety endpoints:  
Safety endpoints will include DLTs, serious adverse events (SAEs ), 
treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs ), adverse events of special 
interest (AESIs), physical examination findings (including ECOG PS), 
vital sign measurements, standard clinical laboratory parameters, ECG 
parameters,  ECHO/MUGA findings , and ophthalmologic findings . 
Efficacy endpoints:  
Tumor response will be evaluated using RECIST version 1.1.  
Objective response rate ( ORR ) (the sum of CR rate and PR rate), 
disease control rate ( DCR ) (the sum of CR rate, PR rate, and stable 
disease [SD] rate), duration of response  (DOR) , clinical benefit rate  
(CBR ; the proportion of subjects who achieved a best overall response 
of CR or PR or SD ≥  6 months ), time to response ( TTR ), progression 
free survival ( PFS), overall survival (OS) , and p ercent change  in target 
lesion (s). 
Planned Sample Size:  The Dose Escalation Part of this study consists of mCRM with EWOC 
design with at least 3 DLT -evaluable subjects per dose level.  Sample 
size has been determi ned by practical considerations  for the Dose 
Escalation  Part. 
A total of approximately 12 subjects will be enrolled between Dose 
Escalation and Dose Finding for  each of  the Q3W Dosing Cohorts 
evaluated in Dose Finding.  For the alternative dosing cohorts 
evaluated  in Dose Finding, a total of approximately 12  subjects will be 
enrolled into each cohort.   RDEs will be determined based on the risk 
and benefit assessment.  
For the Dose Expansion Part, there are 4 planned expansion cohorts : 
HER3 -high, HR -positive  (6.4 mg /kg), HER3 -high, HR -positive 
(4.8 mg/kg), HER3 -low, HR -positive (6.4 mg /kg) and HER3 -high,  
TNBC  (6.4 mg /kg): 
 Approximately 60 eligible subjects with HER3 -high, 
HER2 -negative, HR -positive  disease will be randomized 
into 1 of 2 cohorts:  4.8 mg/kg or 6.4 mg/kg.  
 Subjects with HER3 -low, HER2 -negative, HR -positive 
breast cancer will not be randomized.  Approximately 
20 eligible subjects in this setting  will be enrolled into a 
HER3 -low, HR -positive (6.4  mg/kg) cohort.

Page 17  Subjects with HER3 -high, TNBC  will not be randomized. 
Approximately 30 eligible subjects in this setting will be 
enrolled into a HER3 -high, TNBC (6.4 mg/kg) cohort.  
A total of approximately 110 subjects will be enrolled into the Dose 
Expansion Part.  
In HER3 -high, HR -positive  cohorts of the Dose Expansion Part, if 
target ORR is more than 10% (null hypothesis: ORR  0.10, 
alternative hypothesis:  ORR  >0.10), then the probability of no 
response out of 30 subjects will be less than 5%.  The probability that 
more than 6 responders out of 30 subjects (ORR  >20%) are observed 
will be less than 5% under the null hypothesis with ORR  0.10 but 
more than 80% under alternative hypothesis with ORR  = 0.30.  
In the HER3 -low, HR -positive cohort of the Dose Expansion Part, if 
target ORR is more t han 10% (null hypothesis: ORR 0.10, 
alternative hypothesis: ORR >0.10), then the probability of no 
response out of 20 subjects will be less than 15%.  The probability that 
more than 3 responders out of 20 subjects (ORR  >15.0%) are 
observed will be less th an 15% under the null hypothesis with ORR 
0.10 but more than 75% under alternative hypothesis with 
ORR  = 0.25.  
In the HER3 -high, TNBC cohort of the Dose Expansion Part, if target 
ORR is more than 20% (null hypothesis: ORR 0.20, alternative 
hypothesis: OR R >0.20), then the probability of no response out of 
30 subjects will be less than 5%. The probability that more than 
9 responders out of 30 subjects (ORR >30.0%) are observed will be 
less than 10% under the null hypothesis with ORR 0.20 but more 
than 80%  under alternative hypothesis with ORR  = 0.40.  
The probability values for the sample size are derived based on 
binomial distribution using SAS® version 9.4.  
Statistical Analyses:  The data cutoff for the primary analysis will occur after all subjects 
have either discontinued from the study or have been followed for at 
least 9 months following  the first dose of study treatment, whiche ver 
is earlier.   The primary analysis data cutoff may be extended if 
emerging data show responses are occurring later.  The final analysis 
of the study will occur after all subjects have discontinued the study. 
Data collected beyond the primary analysis cut -off time point will be 
presented as appropriate in a Clinical Study Report addendum . 
Data analyses will also be conducted during the Dose Escalation and 
Dose Finding Part s. 
Descriptive statistics will be provided for selected demographic, 
safety, and PK data by cohort and time as appropriate.  Descripti ve 
statistics on continuous data will include means, medians, standard 
deviations, and ranges (as well as geometric means and geometric 
coefficient of variation for Cmax and AUC PK parameters), while 
categorical data will be summarized using frequency coun ts and 
percentages.  Graphical summaries of the data may be presented.  
Efficacy Analyses : 
Efficacy variables will include ORR , DCR, DOR , CBR,  TTR, PFS,

1.1. Background  
Globally, breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer in women, with 1.5 million 
women impacted each year .1  In the United States  (US) , in 2016, there were  an estimated 
61,000  new cases of in situ disease, 246,660 cases of invasive disease, and 40,450 deaths due to 
breast cancer in women .2 
In Japan , there were 89,400 estimated cases of breast cancer in 2015. Additionally, breast cancer 
represents 21% of all female cancers in Japan .3  The number of cases is increasing every year.  
Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease with respect to molecular alterations, cellular 
composition, and clinical outcome.  This diversity presents a challenge in developing tumor 
classifications that are clinically useful with respect to prognosis or prediction.   Diagnosis by 
intrinsic subtype (eg, hormone receptor [HR] or human epidermal growth factor receptor 
2 [HER2 ] status) adds significant prognostic and predictive information in breast cancer , 
particularly concerning  the risk of relapse .4  Among all breast cancer subtypes , HR -positive and 
HER2 -negative tumors make up  the majority of breast cancer patients.  With regard t o metastatic 
and relapsing breast cancer, the survival of patients with metastasis or relapse has gradually 
improved since the introduction of newer chemotherapeutic agents .5, 6,7  However, d espite these 
modest improvements, there is no single standard of care in late -line treatment for patients with 
metastatic/ relapsing breast cancer and prognosis remains poor in this group .8,9  In general, 
chemotherapies , which were not used in prior cancer treatments , are selected for treatment in late 
line, such as eribulin, capecitabine, vinorelbine, and so on.  According to the Phase 3 study of 
eribulin in patien ts with metastatic breast cancer who received 2 to 5 previous chemotherapy 
regimens , including anthracycline s and taxane s, median progression -free survival  (PFS)  was 
3.7 months and median overall survival  (OS)  was 13 .1 months.10  
In patients with advanced/ unresectable or metastatic breast cancer classified as triple -negative  
breast cancer (TNBC ; HER 2-negative /HR-negative ) chemotherapy remains  the mainstay of 
treatment . While many drugs, including taxanes, anthracyclines, capecitabine, eribulin, S -1, and 
irinotecan, have shown activity, no standard of care has been  established.11, 12  Despite the 
treatment options presented by these agents, the prognosis for TNBC  remains poor, with an 
estimated median overall survival of 10 to 18 months and post -progression survival of 6  months 
after first -line therapy.13, 14  There is still an unmet medical need in advanced TNBC with disease 
progression after  chemotherapy.   
Considering the unmet medical need in breast cancer described here, an urgent need for the 
development of new therapy for  advanced/unresectable or metastatic breast cancer is justified . 
Preliminary data from  Study  U31402 -A-J101  in patients with  human epidermal growth factor 
receptor 3 ( HER3 )-positive , advanced/unresectable or metastatic  breast cancer  (N=42 , total ), 
including 10 subjects with TNBC , showed  a persistent  U3-1402 antitumor effect with a  
confirmed  ORR of 42.9%, a DCR of 90.5%, and a median (range) PFS of 8.3  (1.2, 16.8)  months 
(median follow -up of 10.5 months).

U3-1402  bound specifically to human HE R3 recombinant protein  but did not bind to the other 
human HER family recombinant proteins .  U3-1402 bound  against human, cynomolgus monkey, 
rat, and mouse HER3.  Cynomolgus monkey, rat, and mouse  are therefore considered 
appropriate for the nonclinical pharmacokinetic (PK) and toxicological studies of U3 -1402.  
Significant dose -dependent antitumor activity of  U3-1402 was shown  in the MDA -MB-453 
xenograft mouse model  (Figure  1.1).

inhibition in HER3 1+ gastric tumour and no activity in HER3 0 tumors.  
In addition, U3 -1402 did not show antibody -dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) activity 
against HER3 -expressing human breast cancer cell line. U3 -1402 exerted specific cytotoxic 
activity against HER3 -expressing cells, but did not exert cytotoxic activit y against 
HER3 -negative cells.  
1.2.2.2.  Safety Pharmacology  
In telemetered male cynomolgus monkeys treated with single intravenous (IV) doses of 
U3-1402, no effects on the cardiovascular system, the respiratory system, or the central nervous 
system were observed at  dose levels up to 30  mg/kg , the highest dose level tested .  In addition, in 
human ether -a-go-go-related gene (hERG) studies of MAAA -1181a , the drug component, 
MAAA -1181a  did not inhibit the hERG channel current at concentrations of up to 10  μmol/L 
(approx imately 5000  ng/mL), the highest concentration level tested.  
1.2.2.3.  Pharmacokinetics and Drug Metabolism  
In a single dose IV administration PK study of U3-1402 of 21 days duration in female nude 
mice , estimated plasma concentration at time 0 [C0], area under the plasma  concentration -time 
curve [ AUC ] and terminal elimination half -life [T1/2] increased with increasing dose, and total 
body clearance [ CL] decreased with increasing dose.  
In a single dose IV administration PK study of 21 days duration in cynomolgus monk eys, plasma 
concentrations of U3 -1402 were determined up until Day 7.  The AUC for U3 -1402 had more 
than a  dose proportional  increase  from 0.1 to 1  mg/kg.  The T 1/2 and mean residence time  to 
infinity  [MRTinf ] values increased at 1  mg/kg, and the CL value trended towards a decrease  with 
increasing dose.  Anti -U3-1402 antibodies were detected in all animals on Days 14 and 21 after 
the dosing.  MAAA -1181a  was detected at low concentrations at 0.3  mg/kg (1  animal) and 
1 mg/kg (3  animals) within  24 h after dosi ng. 
The steady -state volume of distribution  [Vss] value showed no apparent change with dose  in 
mice and monkeys . 
The plasma protein binding ratios of MAAA -1181a  (10 ng/mL to 100  ng/mL ) were 90.3% to 
92.5% in mice, 94.2% to 96.7% in rats, 86.5% to 89.1% in monkeys, and 96.8% to 98.0% in 
humans.  
The in vitro  release rates of MAAA -1181a  from U3 -1402 in mouse, rat, monkey and human 
plasma, for 3 weeks were 5.9% or less . 
MAAA -1181a  was metab olized by cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes .  CYP3A4 was the 
primary CYP isoform  in the metabolism ; however, CYP3A5 and CYP2D6 were al so involved in 
the metabolism.  
In rats, excretion of radioactivity from administered 14C-labeled MAAA -1181a 
(14C-MAAA -1181a) i nto feces via bile was predominant.  Unchanged MAAA -1181a was the 
predominant component being excreted into urine, feces, and bile of the rat.

Page 39 MAAA -1181a did not exhibit any potential to inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, 
CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A (5 0% inhibitory concentration [IC 50] >50  μmol/L).  
MAAA -1181a did not exhibit any potential to induce CYP3A4, CYP1A2, and CYP2B6 up to 
30 μmol/L.  MAAA -1181a did not inhibit organic anion transporter (OAT) 3, organic cation 
transporter (OCT) 1, OCT2, organic  anion transporting polypeptide (OATP) 1B3, multidrug and 
toxin extrusion (MATE) 1, MATE2 -K, P-glycoprotein (P -gp), breast cancer resistance protein 
(BCRP), and bile salt export pump (BSEP) (IC 50 >30 μmol/L). MAAA -1181a was a substrate for 
organic anion tr ansporting polypeptide (OATP) 1B1, OATP1B3, multidrug and toxin extrusion 
(MATE) 2 -K, P-glycoprotein (P -gp), breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), and multidrug 
resistance -associated protein (MRP) 1 (but not MRP2 or MRP3).  MAAA -1181a inhibited OAT1 
and OATP1B1 with the IC 50 values of 12.7 and 14.4 μmol/L, respectively, although the values 
were much higher than the observed plasma concentrations of MAAA -1181a in all the 
nonclinical in vivo studies.  In addition, OATPs appeared to contribute to the human h epatic  
uptake of MAAA -1181a.  
In the toxicokinetic s (TK)  evaluation of U3 -1402 in rats (20, 60 , and 194.3  mg/kg of U3 -1402) 
and cynomolgus monkeys (3, 10 , and 30  mg/kg of U3 -1402), C 0, maximum plasma 
concentration [Cmax ] and AUC values of U3 -1402, or MAAA -1181a  generally increased with 
increasing dose after the first dose .  There were no clear sex differences.  In rats, no apparent  
changes in TK parameters were noted after repeated dosing .  In monkeys after the 4th dose, 
plasma concentrations of U3 -1402 showed  decreases in C 0 and AUC values .  However, plasma 
concentrations of MAAA -1181a showed increases in  the Cmax and AUC values  in the 3 and 
10 mg/kg groups . 
Animals in which anti -U3-1402 antibody was detected  tended to have lower AUC and T 1/2 
values of U 3-1402, and higher Cmax of MAAA -1181a  on Day 64 compared to the 
corresponding animals on Day 1.  Anti -U3-1402 antibody was not detected in rats given 20 and 
60 mg/kg on Day 64.  Anti -U3-1402 antibodies were detected in serum samples from several 
U3-1402 -treated rats, and from 11 out of 12 of U3 -1402 -treated monkeys at 3 and 10  mg/kg.  No 
marked differences were observed in PK and TK parameters  in animals between U3 -1402 and 
total antibody  (drug conjugated and unconjugated antibody)  before the occurrence of a positive 
reaction to anti -U3-1402 antibody.   These in vivo and in vitro results indicate tha t U3-1402 is 
stable in plasma.  
1.2.2.4.  Toxicology  
The binding profile of U3 -1402 using an enzyme -linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA) showed 
that U3-1402  bound  to the extra cellular domain of HER3 in rats and cynomolgus monkeys . 
Therefore , for safety assessment, i ntermittent IV dosing studies were conducted in these 
2 cross -reactive species for U3 -1402.  In a 12 -week intermittent dose toxicity study of U3 -1402 
in rats, the animals received 20, 60, or 194.3  mg/kg of U3 -1402 Q3W .  The highest dose level 
selected for this study was the maximum feasible level, considering the tolerable range of dosing 
volume f or rats and formulation concentration.  In a 12 -week intermittent dose toxicity study of 
U3-1402 in the monkey, the animals received 3, 10, or 30 mg/kg  of U3-1402 Q3W based upon 
the results of a preliminary intermittent dose toxicity study ( once every week  [QW] dosing, 
2 weeks) .  In the latter study , 30 mg/kg of U3 -1402 and greater induced cardiotoxic changes  and 
80 mg/kg of U3 -1402 induced moribundity .  An in vitro tissue cross -reactivity study was 
U31402 -A-J101 Clinical Study Protocol  
Version 9.0, 8 Nov 2022  
 
Proprietary and Confidential  
Page 40 conducted using human, cynomolgus monkey, and rat tissue s.  No test -article related effects 
were observed in the 1 - or 6-month intermittent dose toxicity study of U3 -1287 in cynomolgus  
monkeys.  A 4-week  intermittent IV dosing study of MAAA -1181a  was conducted  in rats and 
cynomolgus monkeys  to clarify the toxicity of MAAA -1181a .  In addition, an in vitro 3T3 
neutral red uptake (NRU) phototoxicity study was also conducted because MAAA -1181a  has 
demonstrated photoabsorption in the UV -visible light range.   No phototoxic reaction was noted 
in a single dose phot otoxicity study of MAAA -1181a in pigmented rats at doses up to 3  mg/kg 
(the highest dose administered).  
In the study of intermittent IV dosing of U3 -1402 in the rat (Q3W dosing for 12 weeks  at 20, 60, 
or 194.3 mg/kg ), 1 male given 194.3  mg/kg in the toxicity evaluation group  died and 1 female 
given 194.3  mg/kg in the TK evaluation group became moribund due to  severe liver injury and 
severe suppression of lymphatic/hematopoietic systems.   Myocardial necrosis was seen in the 
animal found dead and single  cell necrosis of corneal epithelium was seen in the moribund 
animal.  In the  surviving animals, the major findings were hepatobiliary , thymic , gastrointestinal, 
reproductive organ , skin,  and dental  toxicity at dose levels of 20  mg/kg and greater, and rena l, 
lymphatic/hematopoietic , pulmonary,  and mammary gland toxicit y at dose levels of 60  mg/kg 
and greater.  At 194.3  mg/kg, treatment -related changes were observed in the mesenteric lymph 
node, urinary bladder (female only), accessory reproductive gland, tongue, harderian gland, 
salivary gland, and skeletal muscle.  Except for the testicular changes, these chang es showed 
recovery  or a tendency  of recovery after 6 -week recovery period .  Therefore , the severely toxic 
dose in 10% of the animals (STD 10) in the rat intermittent IV dosing study of U3 -1402 was found 
to be 194.3  mg/kg because no severe or irreversible to xicity was seen in the surviving animals 
except for that in the testis and an incidence of death was substantially low . 
In a 2 -week preliminary intermittent IV dosing study of U3 -1402 in cynomolgus monkeys 
(QW dosing), 1 male died and 1 female was sacrific ed due to moribundity at 80  mg/kg, the 
highest dose level tested.  The cause of the death or moribundity appeared to be sustained 
deterioration of the animal s’ physical conditions.  The major findings of toxicity in the surviving 
animals in the 30  mg/kg and greater group were observed in the lymphatic/hematopoietic 
systems, digestive system, and heart.  In the 80  mg/kg group, hepatotoxicity , renal , pancreas , and 
skin toxicity were also observed.  
In the intermittent IV dosing study of U3 -1402 in cynomolgus  monkeys ( Q3W , 12 weeks  at 0, 3, 
10, or 30 mg/kg ), there were no deaths or moribund animals.  The major findings of toxicity 
were observed in the thymus and ovary at 10  mg/kg and greater , and in the bone marrow leading 
to suppression of hematopoiesis and in the skin at 30  mg/kg .  Emetic action, immunogenicity 
including anti -U3-1402 antibody production, and increased inflammatory parameters were also 
observed at 3  mg/kg an d greater.  By the end of the 6 -week recovery period, all the treatment -
related changes observed during the dosing period had disappeared or shown a trend of 
reversibility.  Therefore, the highest non -severely toxic dose (HNSTD) was considered  to be 
30 mg/kg in the Q3W dosing regimen bec ause no severe or irreversible toxicity was seen at up to 
30 mg/kg.  
An intermittent dose toxicity study of U3 -1402 for cardiotoxic assessment was additionally 
conducted in cynomolgus monkeys at 30  mg/kg in the QW dosing regimen  for 2 weeks.   One 
male out o f 4 monkeys was sacrificed moribund with severe deterioration of physical conditions 
6 days after the second dose.  This animal had necrosis of cardiac myocytes with notable

Page 41 increase in plasma cardiac troponin I (cTnI) concentration detected just before au topsy.  Higher 
MAAA -1181a  concentration in the heart tissue was also observed in this animal in comparison 
with those of the other 3 animals.   Plasma cTnI was increased transiently in the other 2 out of 
3 monkeys after the first dosing ; however, no histopa thological changes in their heart were 
observed at the end of 2 -week dosing period.  
In the intermittent IV dose toxicity studies of U3-1287 in cynomolgus monkeys ( QW dosing for 
1 or 6 months), the no observed adverse effect level (NO AEL) was  200 mg/kg , the highest dose 
tested, because of no significant changes in any examination . 
In an intermittent IV dose toxicity study of MAAA -1181a  (QW dosing for 4 weeks) in the rat, 
there was no death or moribundity at up to 30  mg/kg.  Toxicity findings in the 
lymp hatic/hematopoietic system, intestinal tract, and the cornea of the eye were observed at 
3 mg/kg and greater.  Findings similar to those in rats were observed in cynomolgus monkeys at 
dose levels of 1  mg/kg and grea ter in a toxicity study of MAAA -1181a  with the same dose 
regimen.  In addition, 1 female died and 1 male was sacrificed moribund at 12  mg/kg.  Although 
effects on the heart (focal myocardial cell degeneration/necrosis) were found in the moribund 
male, there were no abnormal heart findings in the female found dead.  Both animals exhibited 
worsening clinical conditions associated with sustained decreases in food consumption, bone 
marrow toxicity, and intestinal toxicity .  These changes were considered to be  the cause of the 
death and moribundity.  
The common target organs of toxicity of U3 -1402 and MAAA -1181a  were the 
lymphatic/hematopoietic systems, intestine, cornea, liver and heart.  For U3 -1402 treatment, 
there were treatment -related toxicit ies in the lung, kidney, reproductive organ, skin, thymus, 
pancreas, mesenteric lymph node, urinary bladder, accessory reproductive gland, harderian 
gland, salivary gland, and skeletal muscle . 
Tissue -cross reactivity studies of U3 -1402 with human and monkey tissue panels showed no 
U3-1402 -specific immunoreactivity in any tissues.  In rats, there was  U3-1402 specific staining 
in red blood cells, bone marrow, and spleen, with staining of mast cells in a variety of tissues.  
In an in vitro 3T3 NRU phototoxicity st udy, MAAA -1181a  was found to be phototoxic to Balb/c 
3T3 mouse fibroblasts.   However, in an in vivo single dose phototoxicity study of MAAA -1181a 
in pigmented rats, no phototoxic reaction was noted at 3 mg/kg, the highest dose tested . 
1.2.3.  Clinical Experience  
This is a first -in-human study of U3 -1402.  
As of the 25 Aug 2018 data cut -off, 56 subjects had received U3 -1402 as part of 
Study  U31402 -A-J101: 34 subjects in the Dose Escalation Part, 8 subjects in the Dose Finding 
Part, and 14  subjects in the Dose Expansi on Part.  At the time of the data cut -off, 41  subjects 
were receiving treatment, 13  subjects had discontinued treatment due to disease progression, 
1 subject had discontinued treatment due to Grade  2 pneumonitis, and 1  subject had withdrawn 
consent.  
Fifty -four (96.4%) of the 56 treated subjects had experienced at least 1 TEAE.  All 54 subjects 
had also experienced at least 1 TEAE considered by the investigator as related to study drug.

appetite (36  subjects [64.3%]), platelet count decreased (36  subjects [64.3%]), white blood cell 
count decreased (30 subjects [53.6%]), ne utrophil count decreased (29 subjects [51.8%]), 
vomiting (25 subjects [44.6%]), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) increased (23  subjects

[26.8%]), fatigue  (12 subjects  [21.4%]), and malaise (12 subjects [21.4%]).  
Eighteen (32.1%) of the 56 treated subjects had developed treatment -emergent  SAEs, including 
12 subjects (21 .4%) with study drug -related SAEs.  The treatment -emergent SAEs , in 
descending order of frequency, included platelet count decreased (6  subjects [10.7%]); decreased 
appetite (3  subjects [5.4%]); and atelectasis, cellulitis, cholecystitis acute, dehydration , dyspnea, 
implant site infection, malaise, myalgia, pneumonia, pneumothorax, pseudomembranous colitis, 
thrombocytopenia, and urinary tract infection (1 subject [1.8%] each).  
Additional data describing the clinical experience of U3 -1402 are available in th e current 
Investigator’s Brochure . 
1.3. Study Rationale  
U3-1402 is an ADC that targets HER3  and is comprised of a fully human anti -HER3 monoclonal 
IgG1 antibody (U3 -1287) covalently linked to MAAA -1162a (  linker and a 
topoisomerase I inhibitor  [MAAA -1181a ]). The drug MAAA -1181a , a derivative of 
exatecan,15,16,17 is released after internalization of U3 -1402 and leads to apoptosis of the target 
tumor cells by inhibition of topoisomerase I.  
In nonclinical studies, the fact that U3 -1402 binds specificall y to the HER3  extracellular domain 
(ECD ) and does not bind to other HER family proteins has been confirmed.  In vi vo studies 
indicate that U3 -1402 exhibits HER3 expression -dependent cell growth inhibition activity, 
moreover, no growth inhibition was observ ed in HER3 -negative cells, thus confirming the HER3 
specificity of U3 -1402.  U3-1402 showed significant tumor regression in human  breast cancer 
xenograft models.  
In summary, U3 -1402 is hypothesized  to show  anticancer  activity with a manageable safety 
profile  in HER3 -positive cancer . 
High HER3 expression was reported in breast cancer patients.18,19,20  Therefore, U3 -1402 is 
being developed as an ADC targeting HER3 -positive breast  cancer , NSCLC  and potentially 
other solid tumors expressing HER3.  
1.4. Risks and Benefits for Study Subjects  
U3-1402 is being developed for the treatment of HER3 -expressing malignant tumors. The 
product is in the early stages of development.  
Nonclinical studies have demonstrated the antitumor activity of U3 -1402 in HER3 tumor -bearing 
mouse models.  Thus, U3 -1402 is hypothesized to demonstrate efficacy in HER3 -expressing 
tumors in patients.  
In nonclinical toxicology studies, toxicity of intestinal, lymphat ic/hematopoietic, skin, 
pulmonary, reproductive and accessory organ, hepatic, cardio vascular , and renal systems  were

Page 43 found in association with the administration of U3 -1402. As with any therapeutic antibodies, 
there is a possibility of infusion -related rea ctions and immune responses causing allergic or 
anaphylactic reactions to U3 -1402.  Considering the toxicity data from the nonclinical studies, 
the potential risks of QT prolongation, left ventricular ejection fraction  (LVEF)  decreased, 
potential Hy’s Law,  ILD, pneumonitis, infusion -related reaction, dry eye, keratitis, 
photosensitivity, stomatitis, alopecia, dry skin, rash, rash maculopapular, and skin pigmentation 
in humans from exposure to U3 -1402 have been closely monitored and evaluated in the U3 -1402 
clinical development program.  
Based on the preliminary clinical safety data from the ongoing U3 -1402 studies, nausea, 
decreased appetite, platelet count decreased/thrombocytopenia, white blood cell count 
decreased/leukopenia, neutrophil count decreased/neu tropenia, vomiting, anemia, diarrhea  and 
interstitial lung disease/pneumonitis  are identified risks and will continue to be closely monitored 
and evaluated in the U3 -1402 clinical development program.  
In conclusion, based on the efficacy and safety data fr om the nonclinical studies and the 
preliminary clinical efficacy and safety data from the ongoing studies, the benefit/risk balance 
supports continued clinical development of U3 -1402.

will be selected by the Sponsor for further evaluation .  Doses evaluated for alternative 
administration schedules, including up -titration of dose, w ill be equal to or less than the MTD (or 
highest dose evaluated) of U3 -1402 administered via IV infusion Q3W.  Refer to Section  3.1.4  
for details.  
Dose Expansion  Part  
In the Dose Expansion Part, eligible subjects with HER3 -positive (HER3 -high or HER3 -low), 
HER2 -negative,  HR-positive  breast cancer who have received  ≥2 and ≤6 prior chemotherapy 
regimens for breast cancer (including ≥2 regimens administered for the treatment  of 
advanced/unresectable or metastatic disease) and those  with HER3 -high, TNBC who have 
received 1 to 2 prior chemotherapy regimens in the advanced disease setting will be enrolled to 
evaluate safety and efficacy of U3 -1402 at the RDEs .  In the Dose Expansion  Part, multiple 
expansion cohorts will be evaluated as  described in Section  3.1.5 .  
3.1.1.3.  Duration of the Study  
This study is expected to last approximately 7 years from  the time the first subject is enrolled to 
the time the last subject is off the stu dy. The end of the study is defined as the date of completion 
of the last visit or procedure shown in the Schedule of Events (Section  17.8) in the trial globally.  
Sponsor may terminate the study at any time due to administrative rea son or at request from 
competent regulatory authorities .

Page 47 3.1.1.4.  Duration of Subject Participation  
The number of treatment cycles is not limited  in this study.  Subjects will continue study 
treatment until withdrawal of consent,  progressive disease ( PD), unacceptable toxicity , death , or 
termination of the study by Sponsor . 
There is an end -of-treatment (EOT) V isit which occurs within 7 days after the  date of 
discontinuation . A 28-Day F/U Visit ( - 7 days)  takes place 28 days after the last U3 -1402 
administra tion. If the subject begins another anticancer therapy before the end of the 28 days 
(– 7 days), every effort will be made to complete all of the F/U assessments prior to starting  the 
new therapy.  For further details concerning assessments performed at the EOT and F/U Visits 
refer to Section  6.7 and Section  6.8, respectively.  
For s ubjects with positive ADA  at F/U visit  (or EOT visit if F/U visit was not performed) , 
additional serum ADA samples should be collected every 3  months (± 1 month ) for up to 1  year 
after the last dose of U3 -1402, unless one of the following occurs sooner; the ADA becomes 
negative; the ADA titer falls below baseline if ADA was measurable prior to first dose of 
U3-1402; the subject starts another therapy for cancer; or the subject  withdraws consent from the 
study.  
After discontinuation from study treatment, follow -up information for survival and subsequent 
anticancer therapy, if available, should be collected approximately every 3  months ; refer to 
Section  6.9 for details . 
3.1.2.  Dose Escalation Process  and Dose Selection  
The study will enroll subjects into cohorts during  dose escalation by modified continuous 
reassessment method ( mCRM ) with escalation with overdose control ( EWOC ) principle as 
outlined in Section  3.1.3 ).  The starting dose will be 1.6 mg/kg ( see Section  3.2.1  for justification 
of the human starting dose).  
In the Dose Escalation  Part, the second subject in each dosing level should start dosing at least 
24 hours after the initial dosing of the first subject to check the acute toxicity such as 
infusion -related reaction . 
In the Dose Findin g Part, subjects will be enrolled to multiple Dose Finding cohorts equal to or 
less than the MTD  (if attained, or the highest dose evaluated) to determine the RDE s 
(Section  3.1.4 ).  Doses evaluated for alternative administration schedules, including up -titration 
of dose, will be equal to or less than the MTD (or highest dose evaluated) of U3 -1402 
administered via IV i nfusion Q3W.  
In the Dose Expansion  Part, subjects will be enrolled to multiple Dose Expansion cohorts as 
described in  Section  3.1.5 . 
3.1.3.  Dose Escalation  Part  
Dose escalation of U3 -1402 to determine the MTD will be guided by the mCRM using a 
Bayesian logistic regression model ( BLRM ) following EWOC principle.  The proposed human 
starting dose of U3 -1402 is 1.6 mg/kg, based on 1/ 6 human equivalent dose (HED ) of HNSTD in 
monkey (30 mg/kg).  The following planned dose levels will be assessed in the Dose Escalation 
Part (Table  3.1).  U3-1402 will be administer ed via IV infusion Q3W in 21 -day cycles  in the 
Dose Escalation  Part.

Proprietary and Confidential  
Page 49 subject in the new cohort will be based on an updated BLRM using DLT outcome data from all 
assessed doses.   Subject ongoing will continue treatment at their assigned dose level.  
Subjects  can be backfilled (added) to  lower doses previously proven to be safe at any point 
during dose escalation.  
To better understand the safety, tolerability, PK or preliminary activity of U3 -1402, additional 
patients may be enrolled to preceding dose levels, or to intermediate dose level  before or while 
proceeding with further dose escalation.  
The Dose Escalation Part will be stopped according to the following rules:  
i. at least 6 evaluable subjects have been enrolled at the MTD level with at least 
18 evaluable subjects in total enrolled in the Dose Escalation Part 
ii. at least 9 evaluable subjects have been enrolled at a particular dose level , the model 
recommend s continuing at the same dose level , and the posterior probability of the 
DLT rate falling with in the target DLT interval is ≥ 50%.  The target DLT interval  is 
defined as 16% <DLT rate ≤ 33% 
iii. DLT assessment with at least 3 evaluable subjects at the maximum possible dose 
level with upper limit of 95% credible interval for posterior probability of DLT rate is 
lower than 33%  
iv. the initial dose level  is too toxic.  
Cohorts may be expanded at any dose level or at the MTD for further elaboration of safety, or 
PK parameters as required.  
3.1.4.  Dose Finding  Part  
In the Dose Finding  Part, subjects will be enrolled into cohorts with multiple drug doses and/or  
administration schedules,  including up -titration of dose .  Doses evaluated for alternative 
administration schedules, including up -titration of dose, will be equal to or less than the MTD (or 
highest dose evaluated) of U3 -1402 administered via IV infusion Q 3W.  The objectives of the 
Dose Finding Part are to assess the safety and evaluate the efficacy of U3 -1402 and determine 
the RDEs for the Dose E xpansion  Part.  A total of approximately 12  subjects will be enrolled 
between Dose Escalation and Dose Finding for each of  the Q3W Dosing Cohorts evaluated in 
Dose Finding.  For the alternative dosing cohorts evaluated  in Dose Finding, a total of 
approximately 12  subjects will be e nrolled into each cohort.  
Dose Finding Cohorts

3.1.6.  Study Stopping Criteria  
The study treatment will be continued according to the dosing criteria to derive clinical benefit in 
the absence of withdrawal of  subject consent, PD, unacceptable toxicity , or death .  If the study 
treatment is delayed more than 4 w eeks from the planned date of administration  (ie, 49 days 
from the last infusion date) , the subject may be withdrawn from the study  (see Section s 5.4 and 
5.7). 
The study may be terminated any time at the Sponsor’s discretion.  
3.1.7.  Dose -limiting Toxicities  
A DLT is defined as any TEAE not attributable to disease or disease -related processes  that 
occurs during the DLT evaluation  period (Day 1 to Day 21 in Cycle 1  of Dose Escalation Part) 
and is Grade 3 or above  according to National C ancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria 
for Adverse Events ( NCI-CTCAE ) version 5.0, with the exceptions as defined below:  
For hematological toxicities, a DLT is defined as follows:  
 Grade 4 neutrophil count decreased  lasting >7 days , neutrophil count de creased  that 
requires standard therapies, such as colony stimulating factor  (CSF) 
 Grade ≥3 febrile neutropenia  
 Grade  4 anemia  
 Grade  4 platelet count decreased  
U31402 -A-J101 Clinical Study Protocol  
Version 9.0, 8 Nov 2022  
 
Proprietary and Confidential  
Page 52  Grade ≥3 platelet count decreased  lasting > 7 days  
 Grade ≥3 platelet count decreased  with clinical ly significant hemorrhage  
 Grade  4 lymph ocyte count decreased lasting ≥ 14 days  
For hepatic organ toxicities, a DLT is defined as follows:  
 Serum aspartate aminotransferase  (AST ) or serum alanine aminotransferase  (ALT ) >20  
upper limit of normal ( ULN ) 
 AST  or ALT >5  ULN, if accompanied by blood bilirubin >1.5  ULN  
 In subjects without liver metastases, AST  or ALT > 5  ULN  lasting > 3 days 
 In subjects with liver metastases, AST  or ALT >5  ULN lasting > 3 days, if the baseline 
level was  ≤3  ULN  
 In subjects with liver metastases, AST  or ALT > 8  ULN lasting > 3 days, if the baseline 
level was > 3  ULN  
For non -hematological, non -hepatic major organ toxicities, a DLT is defined as follows:  
 Symptomatic congestive heart fai lure (CHF ) 
 Left ventricular ejection fraction  (LVEF ) decline to <40% or >20% drop from baseline  
 Other Grade ≥ 3 non -hematological, non -hepatic major organ toxicities  
The following TEAEs are NOT considered DLTs:  
 Grade 3 fatigue  lasting <7 days 
 Grade 3 nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or anorex ia that has resolved to Grade ≤ 2 within 
3 days 
 Isolated laboratory findings not associated with signs or symptoms including Grade 3/4 
serum alkaline phosphatase  (ALP ) increased, hyperuricemia, serum amylase increased, 
and lipase increased, and Grade 3 hyponat remia lasting  <72 hours  developed from 
Grade 1 at baseline  
 Grade  3 lymphocyte count decreased  
If any of the above toxicities is observed during the DLT evaluation period, whether the toxicity 
is regarded as DLT will be determined based on consultation between the Investigator and 
Sponsor.  
In addition, with regard to other toxicities that impact the conduct of the scheduled study 
treatment, anemia with blood transfusion, or platelet count decreased with platelet transfusion, 
whether they are regarded as DLT will be determined based on consultation between the 
Investigator and Sponsor.  
The premedication,  which is a treatment before study drug administration to avoid adverse event 
(AE), is prohibited dur ing the DLT evaluation period.  
However, the supportive  therapy for the treatment is permitted after study drug administration:

3.1.8.  Maximum Tolerated Dose and Recommended Dose  for Expansion  Definition  
Once the dose escalation stopping criteria are met, the MTD estimated by mCRM + EWOC will 
be the dose with the highest posterior probability of the DLT rate in the target DLT rate interval 
of 16%  <DLT rate ≤33% among all doses fulfilling the overdose control constraint: there is less 
than 25% probability of a DLT rate 33% (probability for excessive or unacceptable toxicity) 
(Section  3.1.3 ).  The final MTD for each dosing schedule will be decided based on 
considerations  of the respective MTDs estimated by the mCRM and on an overall assessment of 
safety data from subsequent cycles and PK information collected at all different doses tested.  
Multiple  drug doses less than the MTD  (if attained, or the highest dose evaluated)  and/or 
administration schedules, including up -titration of dose , will be selected by the Sponsor for 
further evaluation in the Dose Finding  Part.  Doses evaluated for alternative administration 
schedules, including up -titration of dose, will be equal to or less than the MTD (or highest dose 
evaluated) of U3 -1402 administered via IV infusion Q3W.  Based on the safety, PK , and efficacy 
profiles of U3 -1402 obtained from the Dose Escalation and Dose Finding  Parts , multiple  dosing 
regimen s may be selected by the Sponsor for further evaluation in the Dose Expansion  Part. 
The study team will actively monitor all safety data within the EDC database on a regular basis.  
Study drug interruption and modification guidelines are in place for this study and described here 
in the protocol (Section  5.4). During the Dose Expansion  Part, Safety Review Meeting s will 
occur as needed to assess safety and tolerability of the selected RDE s. 
3.1.9.  Management of Subjects with Adverse Events  
See Section  5.4. 
3.2. Discussion of Study Design  
3.2.1.  Human Starting Dose  
For the first in human, dose escalation clinical trial with U3 -1402, the proposed hum an starting 
dose (HSD) is 1.6  mg/kg.  This dose was selected based on the following rationale:  
In the 12 -week intermittent dose toxicity study in rats, no severe and irreversible toxicity was 
seen in surviving males and females except for testis effects at  194.3  mg/kg, although 1 of 
15 males died in the 194.3 mg/kg group after the 4th administration.  Therefore, under the 
conditions of this study, the STD 10 of the animals was considered to be 194.3  mg/kg, which was 
also the highest (maximum feasible) dose l evel tested.  By determining 1/10 of the STD 10 and 
taking the HED of this conversion  results in a HSD of 3.1  mg/kg.  
In the 12 -week intermittent dose toxicity study in monkeys, the HNSTD was 30  mg/kg, which 
was the highest dose level tested.  By determining  1/6 of the HNSTD and taking the HED of this 
conversion results in a HSD of 1.6  mg/kg.  
With regard to the interests of patients for considering the safety, 1.6  mg/kg was determined as 
the HSD, which was also the maximum recommended starting dose.  At the p roposed HSD,

Page 54 estimated human U3 -1402 AUC (<43.7  μg·d/mL), which was calculated based on the hypothesis 
that human PK is the same as monkey, is greater than mouse AUC at 1.5  mg/kg (27.8  μg·d/mL) , 
which  showed the regression of tumor size from the initiation of dosing in a subcutaneous 
xenograft model using the MDA -MB-453 cell line (HER3 -expressing).  In case that  the effic acy 
in human is expected to the  same as that  to the xenograft model, 1.6  mg/kg is considered to be 
efficacious for the  cancer therapy . 
3.2.2.  Treatment Schedule  
Based on the result of nonclinical toxicology  studies ( Section  1.2.2.4 ), death or moribundity 
were  observed in once weekly  dosing.  The cause of the death or moribundity appeared to be 
sustained deterioration of the animal  physical conditions.   Therefore, Q3W and Q2W  dosing 
schedule s were selected .

amenorrhea (in questionable cases, a blood sample with simultaneous folli cle-stimulating 
hormone [FSH] > 40 mI U/mL and estradiol < 40 pg/mL [ <140  pmol/L] is confirmatory).  
Females on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and whose  menopausal status is in 
doubt will be required to discontinue HRT and use 1 of the contraception methods 
outlined above for women of childbearing potential.   Otherwise, they must discontinue 
HRT to allow confirmation of post -menopausal status prior to stu dy enrollment.   For 
most forms of HRT, at least 2 to 4 weeks must elapse between the cessation of therapy 
and the blood draw; this interval depends on the type and dosage of HRT.  Use of HRT is 
not allowed during the study.  Men who are fertile and sexuall y active should be willing 
to use highly effective methods of contraception if their partners are of reproductive 
potential.  
Male subjects must not freeze or donate sperm starting at Screening and throughout the 
study period, and at least 4 months after th e final study drug administration.

Investigators will be expected to maintain an Enrollment Log of all subjects enrolled  and screen 
failed  in the study  indicating their assigned Subject  Number .  The unique Subject Number  will 
be assigned by IRT for all subjects who provide written informed consent  for tumor screening . 
Each subject will be provided with information about the study, will have all questions answered 
to their satisfaction, and will sign and date an ICF. This must be completed before any 
study -specific procedures are performed.  Separate Informed consent  must be obtained for the 
examination of HER3 expression in the tumor  tissue .  Additional information about informed 
consent procedures is provided in Section  15.3.

Page 64 After obtaining an informed consent  for tumor screening , the Investigator or designee should 
perform a tumor biopsy or should request archive tumor tissue. Tumor tissue  (fresh or archived)  
must be sent to a central laboratory selected by the Sponsor to determine HER3 expression.  
Results of HER3 IHC testing will be reported to the Investigator by the central laboratory. 
During the Dose Expansion  Part, subjects with HER3  positive expression determined using an 
archived tumor tissue sample will re quire a fresh tumor biopsy prior to study treatment .  Fresh 
tumor tissue obtained from this biopsy must be sent to the central laboratory selected by the 
Sponsor to determine HER3 expression; these results are not required for study eligibility.  The 
Investigator  or designee  must also send all computed tomography ( CT) or magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI ) scans  performed within 28 days of enrollment  to the central imaging CRO 
selected by the Sponsor  for confirm ation  of measurable disease  per RECIST version 1.1 . The 
central imaging CRO review results will b e report ed to the Investigator  to confirm eligibility.  
After obtaining written informed consent ( Section  15.3), the Investigator or designee must  
determin e if all inclusion and exclusion criteria hav e been satisfied , including obtaining a fresh 
tumor biopsy , if required . A subject is considered enrolled in the study once the Investigator 
enters all required data of eligible subjects into the IRT (IWRS) . After the confirmation of the 
eligibility of the subject, the Investigator or designee enter s subject data in the IRT . The date of 
enrollment  is defined as the date that the subject is confirmed e ligible in the IRT.  
When the subject is enrolled , administration dos e and dos ing schedule  will be assigned by the 
IRT. Investigators must  confirm the dosing regimen assigned by the IRT before administration of 
U3-1402.  
For screen fail subjects, Investigators must explain the reason of screen failure to the subject  and 
then record the date of screen failure and the reason of failure in the IRT. 
Electronic case report form (eCRF ) will be created for all subjects who have signed informed 
consent  for participation in the study .  An eCRF will not be created for subjects who have signed  
informed consent for examination of the tumor only.   Data for all study visits will be recorded on 
the eC RF for subjects who receive study drug.   Only minimal data will be recorded as screening 
failures  on the eCRF for subjects who do not meet eligibility  and/or do not receive study drug.  
Further data, such as AEs, will not be collected from subjects once they are considered screen 
failures or have decided to withdraw prior to receiving study drug.

Pulmonary toxicity  See next column  If a subject develops radiographic changes potentially 
consistent with ILD /pneumonitis  or develops an acute 
onset of new or worsening pulmonary or other related 
signs/symptoms such as dyspnea, cough or fever, rule out 
ILD/pneumonitis . 
If ILD /pneumonitis  is suspected, delay U3 -1402 dosing 
pending further evaluation and start corticosteroid 
treatment promptly unless clinically contraindicated.  
Evaluations must include CT (preferably high -resolution 
CT), and pulmonologist consultation (when the 
Investigator is not a pulmonologist).  The following 
evaluations must also be obtained, as indicated : 
• Infectious disease consultation as clinically 
indicated  
• Blood culture and CBC (other blood tests could 
be considered as needed)  
• Bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage if 
clinically indicated and feasible  
• Pulmonary function tests  
• Pulse oximetry (SpO 2) 
• Arterial blood gases, as clinically indicated  
• Diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon 
monoxide (DLCO), as clinically indicated  
• One blood sample collection for PK analysis as 
soon as ILD is suspected, if feasible  
• Other tests, as clinically indicated  
If a n oninflammatory/infectious etiology is confirmed by 
the Investigator, treat accordingly and resumption of U3 -
1402 may occur after discussion between the Investigator 
and Sponsor.  
All events of ILD regardless of severity or seriousness will 
be followed until  resolution including after drug

5.7. Subject Withdrawal/Discontinuation  
5.7.1.  Reasons for Withdrawal  
Any subject who discontinues from the study treatment for any reason will have their study 
treatme nt discontinuation recorded.  
Subjects may be withdrawn from the study after signing informed consent for the following 
reasons:  
 Progressive disease ( PD) per RECIST  version 1.1  
 Clinical progression : provide date  (ie, definitive clinical signs of disease progression, 
but a recent radiographic assessment did not meet the criteria for PD according to 
RECIST version 1.1)  
 AE 
 Death  
 Pregnancy  
 Withdrawal of consent by subject  
 Lost to follow -up 
 Protocol violation (specify)  
 Study terminated by Sponsor  
 Other, specif y (eg, Investigator discretion)  
If there is evidence that the subject is receiving benefit from treatment even though the subject 
has met a criterion for discontinuation as listed above, the subject may remain on study treatment 
after discussion with and a pproval from the Sponsor.  
Discontinued subjects will be followed for survival, either through direct contacts or by 
collecting public records (eg, death certif icates) as allowed by local laws .

Page 82 5.7.2.  Withdrawal Procedures  
If a subject is withdrawn  from the study, the Investigator will complete and report the 
observations as thoroughly as possible up to the date of withdrawal , including the date of last 
treatment and the reason for withdrawal.  
If the subject is withdrawn due to an AE, the Investigator will follow the subject until the AE has 
resolved or stabilized  as possible . All subjects who are withdrawn from the study  and received 
study treatment  should complete protocol -specified withdrawal procedures.   Protocol -specified 
withdra wal procedures will involve an EOT visit and a F/U visit 28 days ( − 7 days)  after the last 
administration of U3-1402 . Protocol -specified withdrawal procedures are the same as those to be 
performed at the EOT visit and the F /U visit (Section  6.7 and Section  6.8). 
If the subject is withdrawn due to reasons other than death , withdrawal of consent,  loss to 
follow -up, or study closure , and received study treatment, disease progression should be 
followed  until PD or starting new anticancer therapy , whichever occurs first regardless of 
Follow -up period  (Section  6.4.2 ). 
If the subject is withdrawn due to reasons other than death , withdrawal of consent,  loss to 
follow -up, or study closure , and receive d study treatment, follow -up for survival and subsequent 
anticancer therapy, if available ( Section  6.9). 
5.7.3.  Subject Replacement  
Subject replacement is not allowed for this study.  
5.7.4.  Subject Re -screening Procedures  
The study will allow re -screening for any subject who failed to meet eligibility criteria upon 
initial screening.  A new Subject Number will be assigned at re -screening.  The initial screening 
information and the reason why the subject was ineligible for the initial evaluation will be 
recorded on the Screening Log.  
5.8. Criteria for Suspending Study Treatment  
The subject should  be discontinued from the study under the following con ditions:  
1. If a subject is assessed as requiring a dose delay longer than 4 weeks  (See Section  5.4), 
after discussion with the Sponsor . 
2. If a subject is assessed PD (per RECIST  version 1.1 ) or clinical progression by the 
Investigator.  
3. If a subject presents any significant AE, as determined by the Investigator.  
4. If any major protocol violation occurred, at the discretion of Investigator and Sponsor.  
5. If become s clear that the subject did not meet the inclusi on/exclusion criteria , after 
discussion with the Sponsor . 
6. If the subject withdraws consent.  
7. If the study is terminated by the Sponsor.  
8. At the discretion of Investigator , according to the condition of subject .

See Section s 3.1.3 , 3.1.4 , 3.1.5 , and 5.2.4 . 
6.4.2.  Tumor Assessment  
Tumor assessments of the chest, abdomen, pelvis , and other areas where scans were performed at 
screening or where new disease  is suspected  should be  performed every 6 weeks (± 7 days) in 
the first 24 weeks after Day 1 of Cycle 1 and every 12 weeks (±  7 days) thereafter. Tumor 
assessments should not be d elayed by dose interruptions; they are timed relative to Cycle 1, 
Day 1 and should continue until PD or until a new anticancer therapy is started, whichever 
occurs first.  
CT or MRI scans of the chest, abdomen , and pelvis are mandatory. The same methodology  (CT 
or MRI) and scan acquisition techniques (including use or nonuse of IV contrast) that were used 
for the screening assessments should be used throughout the study for all assessments for each 
subject , unless prior approval is obtained from the Sponsor.   Unscheduled tumor assessments 
may be conducted if progression is suspected.   Tumor assessments should be performed per 
RECIST version 1.1 ( Section  17.4). 
A brain scan (CT of the brain with contrast or MRI of the brain pre - and post -gadolinium) should 
be performed at screening.   During the treatment period, CT or MRI of the brain should be 
performed in subjects with baseline brain metastases or where  clinically indicated, and within a 
target of 1  week (+  1 week)  after a subject achieves CR.  
A bone scan should be performed at screening.  In subjects whose body CT/MRI scans indicate  
that CR has been achieved, a bone scan (within a target of 1 week [+ 1 week]) will be required at 
confirmation of CR to exclude new bone metastases.  
All images including CT and MRI must be submitted to the central imaging CRO selected by the 
Sponsor for independent tumor assessment.  
6.4.3.  ECG Measure ment  
Triplicate ECGs should  be taken in close succession, a few minutes apart, after the subject has 
been in a supine/semi -recumbent position for 5 minutes.  All ECG data that are collected will be 
sent to the central laboratory for ECG analysis.

 [Dose Expansion Part Only ] Optional  tumor biopsy should be obtained from primary 
tumor or a metastatic sit e, preferably from a site of recent radiographic progression, 
within 30 days  of the date of discontinuation  and prior to starting any new anticancer 
treatment . 
 Perform same imaging tumor assessment as at the time of screening by CT or MRI 
scans.  If the previous tumor assessment was performed within the last 21 days, this 
assessment does not need to be performed.  CT or MRI scans of the chest, abdomen 
and pelvis are mandatory.  CT or MRI of the brain should be performed in subjects 
with baseline brain metastases or if clinically indicated.  
 Record concomitant medications.  
 Assess for AEs.  
 Record reason for treatment discontinuation.  
6.8. Follow -up 
The F/U visit should occur 28 days ( – 7 days) after the last administration of U3 -1402.  If the 
subject begins ano ther anticancer therapy before the end of the 28 days ( – 7 days), every effort 
will be made to complete all the F/U assessments prior to commencing the new therapy.  In case 
of unresolved AEs, the Investigator will follow the AEs until the event has resolv ed or the 
condition has stabilized as possible. If assessments at EOT or in the treatment period are 
performed within this period, they can be considered as the F/U data and there is no need to 
repeat them.  If discontinuation of treatment is decided later than 28 days after the last 
administration of U3 -1402, there is no need to perform the F/U visit.  
The following information will be collected at this F/U visit:  
 Perform a complete physical examination and record weight.  
 Assess functional status using the E COG PS Scale ( Section  17.3). 
 Obtain vital sign measurements (systolic and diastolic blood pressure  and pulse rate  
and body temperature).  
 Obtain blood samples for safety laboratories  (Section  8.8) and ADA* (Section  6.10.6 ). 
*For subjects with positive ADA  at F/U visit  (or EOT visit if F/U visit was not 
performed) , additional serum ADA  samples may be collected every 3 months 
(± 1 month) up to 1 year from the last dose of study drug, or if the ADA  becomes 
negative, or if ADA  titer becomes less than baseline (applicable when pre -existing

consent from the study, whichever occurs first.  
 Record concomitant medications.  
 Assess for AEs.  
6.9. New Cancer Treatment and Survival Follow -up 
After discontinuation from all study treatment, follow -up information for survival and 
subsequent anticancer therapy, if available, will be obtained  approximately every 3 months  from 
the date of F/U visit or Safety Follow -up, whichever is later, until death, withdrawal of consent, 
loss to follow -up, or study closure, whichever occurs first.  If direct contacts are not possib le due 
to withdrawal of consent or loss to follow -up, the site must make every effort to collect survival 
status from public records (eg, death certificates) in accordance with local laws.   
Subsequent anticancer t reatment and survival follow -up information will not be collected after 
the implementation of protocol Version 8.0 , which occurs  upon the IRB approval of protocol 
Version 8.0 at study sites .

ADA  will be collected into blood sampling tubes supplied by the Sponsor.  The collected blood 
will be centrifuged to separate the serum /plasma .  The serum samples will be shipped to a central 
laboratory.  
Refer to the Laboratory Manual for information regarding  the handling of blood samples and 
shipping of serum  samples . 
6.10.2.  Tumor Sampling  
In the Dose Expansion part, for those subjects with HER3 -positive tissue assayed u sing an 
archived tumor tissue sample, a fresh tumor biopsy should be collected before  the first dose of 
U3-1402 .  This fresh tumor biopsy is optional  for the Dose Finding Part.  
It is recommended (although optional) to perform a tumor  biopsy approximately 48 to 72 hour s 
after the end of infusion of U3-1402 on Cycle 2, Day 1 in the Dose Expansion  Part.  
Additionally, blood  samples  for HER3ECD, cfDNA , cfRNA,  and PK assessm ents should be 
collected ±  4 hours from the time of  this optional biopsy, if obtained.  A minimum of 20 subjects 
in the HER3 -high, HR -positive cohorts, a minimum of 6 subjects in the HER3 -low, HR -positive 
cohort and a minimum of 9 subjects in the HER3 -high, TNBC cohort  will be required to submit 
on-treatment biopsies during the Dose Expansion  Part. 
An optional  tumor biopsy may be performed at  EOT in the Dose Expansion  Part. 
Tissue from these biopsies  will be examined for biomarkers, mutational status (DNA/RNA) , and 
gene expression analysis (RNA) to elucidate mechanism of action and resistance  to study drug.

Based on the evaluation of pre-treatment tumor sample, t he levels of HER3  in fresh biopsies  will 
be assessed by IHC.   The exploratory biomarkers ( eg, HER3 ECD , mRNA, cfDNA , cTnI , and 
PD-L1) will be assessed accordingly , at pre-treatment, on -treatment , and post -treatment  time 
point s.  Tissue biopsy samples will be used for analyses of IHC, and mRNA ; and liquid biopsy 
will be used for analyses of proteins, mRNA , cfRNA , and cfDNA.  
The purpose of the HER3ECD assay is to determine  its potential to be a predictive marker of 
drug efficacy or a surrogate for IHC.  
A variety of assays may be used to help  us to understand U3 -1402 mechanism of action 
(ie, tumor cell apoptosis, immune profiling), mechanism of resistance (i e, downregulation / 
mutation of HER3, loss of ADC internalization, attenuation of cathepsin levels/activity, 
upregulation of drug export, etc.) and correlation of biomarkers with clinical activity 
(ie, HER3ECD, mutational profiling of cfDNA, cfRNA , and mRNA).  
cTnI will be assessed as a n exploratory bio marker for drug safety.  
Blood samples  of approximately 4 mL for HER3 ECD  analyses will be collect ed at the time

7.1. Pharmacokinetic Assessm ent(s) 
The serum PK parameters listed in Table  7.1 of U3 -1402, total anti -HER3 antibody and 
MAAA -1181a  for each subject will be estimated using standard  noncompartmental methods.  
The other PK parameter s (elimination rate constant associated with the terminal phase  [Kel], 
T1/2, CL,  volume of distribution based on the terminal phase  [Vz], and  Vss) will be calculated if 
data permits.  Population PK and exposure -response analyses for U3 -1402 , total anti -HER3 
antibody and MAAA -1181a  will be performed to characterize the relationships between dose and 
exposure and between exposure and eff icacy and/or safety endpoints.   If performed, results of 
population PK  or exposure -response analyses will be reported separately (ie, not in the Clinical 
Study Report).

Not applicable.  
7.3. Biomarker and Exploratory Assessment(s)  
Subjects will be requested  to provide a tumor sample for assessing HER3 expression at study 
entry and optionally at some  additional time points during the course of clinical study.  
Clinical samples , includ ing tumor tissue  and blood, will be retained until the end of the defined 
storage period and may be analyzed for exploratory research purpose s. The sample collection 
information should be recorded in the eCRF.  
Detailed instructions for the collection, handling, and shipping of biomarker samples are outlined 
in the Laboratory Manual.  
All subjects will be asked to provide written consent to supply tumor tissue (archival tissue or 
fresh tumor biopsy)  and blood samples for research purposes prior to study entry.  
7.3.1.  HER3 expression  
The level of HER3 expression will be assessed by IHC using archival or fresh biopsy provided 
by the patient . In the Dose Expansion Part, the level of HER3 expression in pre-study treatment, 
on-study treatment and post-study treatment will be assessed  with the biopsy sample .  
7.3.1.1.  Tumor Sample Collection  
Refer to the Laboratory Manual for instructions regarding archived and fresh tumor tissue 
handling and  shipping.

Proprietary and Confidential  
Page 111 Study Entry  
Tissue to analyze for HER3 expression for study eligibility may be obtained from  fresh tumor 
biopsy or from archived tumor samples .  
 A fresh tumor biopsy may be requested from  subjects with a HER3 -negative tissue 
result that was assayed using an archived tumor tissue sample. Tumor tissue obtained 
from  this fresh biopsy should be sent to the central laboratory for the re -assay of the 
HER3 status. Tumor samples must be obtained after the date of informe d consent for 
tumor screening.  
Pre-treatment Biopsy  
 For the Dose Finding  Part, perform an optional  tumor biopsy for subjects with 
HER3 -positive tissue that was assayed using an archived tumor tissue sa mple.  Tumor 
tissue from the  fresh biopsy should be sent to the central laboratory for analysis of 
HER3 IHC; these results are not required for study entry.  
 For the Dose Expansion  Part, perform a tumor biopsy for subjects with 
HER3 -positive tumor tissue that was assayed using an archived tumor tissue sample.  
Tumor tissue from this fresh biopsy should be sent to the central laboratory for 
analysis of HER3 IHC; these results are not required for study entry.  
On-study Biopsy  (Dose Expansion Part Only) 
An optional  on-study tumor biopsy may be performed approximately 48 to 72 hours after the 
end of the U3-1402 infusion  on Cycle 2, Day 1 . Additionally, blood for HER3ECD, cfDNA , 
cfRNA, and PK should be collected ±  4 hours from the time of this optional biopsy, if obtained .  
A minimum of 20 subjects in the HER3 -high, HR-positive cohorts , a minimum of 6 subjects in 
the HER3 -low, HR-positive  cohort , and a minimum of 9  subjects in the  HER 3-high, TNBC  
cohort  will be required to submit on -treatment biopsies during the Dose Expansion Part. Consent 
for this biopsy should be documented in the tissue consent portion of the ICF. Tumor tissue from 
this biopsy should be obtained from the primary tumor or metastatic si te. 
End-of-treatment Biopsy  (Dose Expansion Part Only) 
An optional  end-of-treatment tumor biopsy may be performed at the time of progression or 
discontinuation from study treatment.   Consent for this biopsy should be documented in the 
tissue consent portion of the appropriate ICF.  Tumor biopsy should be obtained from the 
primary tumor or a metastatic site, preferably from a site of recent radiographic progression, 
within 30 days of the date of discontinuation , and prior to starting any new anticancer treatment.  
Any SAEs directly related to a tumor biopsy procedure and performed after signing the 
appropriate ICF should be reported according to Section 8.5. 
7.3.2.  Biomarker  Assessments in Tumor Tissue and Blood Samples   
The b iomarkers will be analyzed with the intent of identifying those subjects who will most 
likely derive clinical benefit from treatment with U3 -1402.  Further exploratory tissue or 
blood -based biomarkers may be analyzed based on emerging scientific knowledge to better 
understand the target disease and also possibly the effects of study treatment .

Proprietary and Confidential  
Page 112 Exploratory analysis  will be done to assess the status of some  biomarkers (eg, HER3ECD, 
mRNA, cfDNA, cfRNA, PD-L1 and cTnI) . 
During the study, in addition to the biomarkers specified above, other exploratory biomarker 
research may be conducted on tissue and/or blood  samples.  These studies would extend the 
search for other potential biomarkers relevant to the effects of U3 -1402, cancer, and/or resistance 
to the treatment. This may include the development of ways to detect, monitor or treat cancer. 
These additional investigation s would be dependent upon clinical outcome, reagent and sample 
availability . 
The results from exploratory biomarker research may be pooled with biomarker data from other 
studies with the investigational product to generate hypotheses to be verified in future studies.  
7.4. Immunogenicity  
Blood samples will be obtained at the time points specified in Section  17.1.  The details on 
immunogenicity blood sam ple collection, handling and shipment  are described in the Laboratory 
Manual .  The immunogenicity testing will be performed using a validated anti-drug antibodies 
(ADA ) assay  which is comprised of tiered steps including screening, confirmatory as well as titer 
determination.  ADA  samples confirmed  positive will be banked until availability of a 
neutralizing a nti-drug antibody assay.  
Immunogenicity will be assessed through characterization of incidence and titer of ADA.  The 
number and percentage of subjects will be calculated for the presence or absence of development 
of ADA after the start of administration, defining subjects who are negative for ADA at all time 
points as negative and subjects who are positive for ADA at least 1 time point as positive.  The 
raw values and change from baseline for ADA titers will be summarized by time point and 
treatment group using descriptive statistics . 
7.5. Pharmacogenomic  Analysis  
7.5.1.  Genomic or Genetic Banking and Analysis  
7.5.1.1.  Genomic or Genetic B anking and Analysis  
In the Dose Expansion Part, a  single blood sample ( 20 mL) for cfDNA  (10 mL) and  
cfRNA  (10 mL) analysis will be collected pretreatment on  Cycle 1 , Day 1 ; on treatment Cycle 2 , 
Day 3 ; and at EOT  from subjects who provide consent.  
Pharmacogenomic samples may be analyzed for genes involved in absorption, distribution, 
metabolism, elimination, safety, and efficacy of the study drug. Additionally, samples may be 
analyzed for genes involved in study drug -related signaling pathways, or t o examine diseases or 
physiologic processes related to the study drug.  Subject samples will not be sold to anyone.  
This information may be useful in increasing the knowledge of differences among individuals in 
the way they respond to the study drug, as w ell as helping in the development of new drugs or 
improvement of existing drugs.

7.5.1.3.  Disclosure of the Results of Genomic or Genetic Analysis  
Because the nature and value of future pharmacogenomic research cannot be known at this time, 
any results obtained from research involving pharmacogenomic samples will not be disclos ed to 
the subject or Investigators now or in the future.  
7.5.1.4.  Storage and Disposal of Specimens for Genomic or Genetic Banking and 
Analysis  
Samples will be retained until exhausted, or 15 years if required by local regulations, or until the 
Sponsor requests dis position.  
If the subject withdraws consent, the banked  tumor and  blood samples will be promptly managed 
regarding proper disposition.  However, the data will not be discarded if genetic analysis has 
been completed before the subject withdraws consent .

Page 114 8. SAF ETY EVALUATION AND REPORTING  
8.1. Assessment of Safety Endpoint Event(s)  
Safety endpoints will include DLTs, SAEs, TEAEs, AESIs, physical examination findings 
(including ECOG PS), vital sign measurements, standard clinical laboratory parameters, ECG 
parameters,  ECHO/MUGA findings, and ophthalmologic assessments. Dose escalation will be 
determined by the incidence of DLTs.  
8.2. Adverse Event Collection and Reporting  
All clinical AEs occurring after the subject signs the ICF and up to F/U visit  after the last dose of 
study drug (ie, the follow -up period), whether observed by the Investigator or reported by the 
subject, will be recorded on the Adverse Event Case Report Form  (CRF ) page.  Medical 
conditions (including clinical laboratory values/vital signs that are out of range) that were 
diagnosed or known to exist prior to Informed Consent will be record ed as part of medical 
history.  
All AEs, AESIs,  events of overdose, and SAEs are to be reported according to the procedures in 
Section 8.5. 
All clinical laboratory  results, vital signs, and ECG result s or findings  should be appraised by the 
Investigator to determine their clinical significance .  Isolated abnormal clinical labora tory 
results, vital sign findings, or ECG findings ( ie, not part of a reported diagnosis) should be 
reported as AEs if they are symptomatic, lead to study drug discontinuation,  dose reduction,  
require corrective treatment, or constitute an AE in the Invest igator’s  clinical judgment . 
At each time point , the Investigator will determine whether any AEs have occurred by evaluating 
the subject.  Adverse events may be directly observed, reported spontaneously by the subject or 
by questioning the subject at each time point .  Subjects should be questioned in a general way, 
without asking about the occurrence of any specific symptoms.  The Investigator must assess all 
AEs to determine seriousness, severity, and causality, in accordance with the definitions in 
Sectio n 8.4.  The Investigator’s assessment must be clearly documented in the study site’s source 
documentation with the  Investigator’s signature.  
Always report the diagnosis as the AE or SAE term.  When  a diagnosis is unavailable, report the 
primary sign or symptom as the AE or SAE term with additional details included in the narrative 
until the diagnosis becomes available.  If the signs and symptoms are distinct and do not suggest 
a common diagnosis, re port them as in dividual entries of AE or SAE.  
For events that are serious due to hospitalization, the reason for hospitalization must be reported 
as the SAE  (diagnosis or symptom requiring hospitalization).  A procedure is not an AE or SAE, 
but the reason for the procedure may be an AE or SAE.  Pre -planned (prior to signing the ICF) 
procedure s or treatment s requiring hospitalization for pre -existing conditions that do not worsen 
in severity should not be reported as SAEs (see Section  8.4.2  for definitions ). 
For deaths, the underlying or immediate cause of death should always be reported as an SAE.  
Progressive disease is a study endpoint and consequently, should not be reported as an AE/SAE.  
However, when a subject  dies from PD with no other immediate causes, “Progressive disease” 
should be reported as an SAE.  In addition, any serious, untoward eve nt that may occur 
U31402 -A-J101 Clinical Study Protocol  
Version 9.0, 8 Nov 2022  
 
Proprietary and Confidential  
Page 115 subsequent to the reporting period that the Investigator assesses as related to study drug should 
also be reported and managed as an SAE.  The Investigator should follow subjects with AEs until 
the event has resolved or the condition has s tabilized.  In case of unresolved AEs, including 
significant abnormal clinical laboratory values at the end of study assessment, these events will 
be followed until resolution or until they become clinically not relevant.  
8.3. Adverse Events of Special Interest  
Based on the available preclinical data , review of the cumulative literature , and reported AEs for 
agents of the same class of ADC components of monoclonal antibody or payload of U3 -1402 ; 
the events described below are considered to be AESIs .  AESIs will be collected through targeted 
questionnaires  within the eCRF  or via paper form  (in the event an eCRF is unavailable) .  Please 
refer to the IB for additional information.  
8.3.1.  Cardiotoxicity (Cardiac -related Events Including QT Prolongation and LVEF 
Decreased)  
LVEF will be measured by either ECHO or MUGA scan.  All ECHOs/MUGAs must be 
evaluated by the Investigator or a delegated physician for monitoring cardiac function.  The same 
modality (ECHO or MUGA) should be used for the subject throughout the study.   In addition, 
standard ECG parameters will be measured, including RR, PR, and QT intervals, and QRS 
duration.   All ECGs must be evaluated by Investigator or a delegated physician for the presence 
of abnormalities.  In this study, cTnI testing will be used as an  exploratory biomarker in parallel 
with standard clinical assessments of cardiac function (eg,  ECHO/MUGA and ECG).  
8.3.2.  Pulmonary Toxicity (Interstitial Lung Disease/Pneumonitis)  
If a subject develops an acute onset of new or worsening pulmonary or other relate d 
signs/symptoms such as dyspnea, cough or fever, rule out ILD/pneumonitis.   If ILD/pneumonitis 
is suspected, delay U3 -1402 dosing pending further evaluation.  Refer to Table  5.2 for guidance 
on further evaluation and management of ILD/pneumonitis.  
8.3.2.1.  Interstitial Lung Disease Adjudication Committee  
An independent ILD Adjudication Committee for U3 -1402 is responsible for reviewing all cases 
of potential ILD /pneumonitis. To ensure adequate and relevant independent evaluation, 
systematic additional data collection will be conducted for all cases that will be brought for 
adjudication.  This data collection will be triggered for adverse events reported using Med DRA 
preferred terms (PT) from  the current ILD Standard MedDRA Query (SMQ) and the PTs of 
acute respiratory failure and respiratory failure.  
8.3.3.  Hepatotoxicity  (Potential Hy’s Law ) 
All hepatic events (both serious and non -serious, and clinical laboratory result s) which meet the 
potential Hy’s Law criteria defined as an elevated (ALT or AST) ≥3 × ULN and an elevated total 
bilirubin >2 × ULN that may occur simultaneously or at different time points during the study, 
regardless of whether these hepatic events are s ymptomatic, lead to study drug discontinuation, 
dose reduction or dose interruption, require corrective treatment, constitute an AE in the 
Investigator’s clinical judgment and/or are related to disease progression .

Version 9.0, 8 Nov 2022  
 
Proprietary and Confidential  
Page 116 8.4. Adverse Event  
8.4.1.  Definition of Adverse Event  
An AE is a ny untoward medical occurrence in a subject administered a pharmaceutical product  
and that does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment.  An AE can 
therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abn ormal clinical laboratory 
finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal 
product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product ( International Council for 
Harmonization  (ICH) E2A Guideline.  Clinic al Safety Data Management: Definitions and 
Standards for Expedited Reporting, Oct 1994).  
It is the responsibility of Investigators, based on their knowledge and experience, to determine 
those circumstances or abnormal clinical laboratory  findings which sho uld be considered AEs. 
8.4.2.  Serious Adverse Event  
An SAE is a ny untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
 Results in death,  
 Is life -threatening,  
 Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization,  
 Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity,  
 Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or  
 Is an important medical event.  
Note:  The term “life -threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers to an event in which the 
subject was at risk of death at the time of the eve nt; it does not refer to an event which 
hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe (ICH E2A Guideline.  Clinical 
Safety Data Management:  Definitions and Standards for Expedited Reporting, Oct 1994).  
Medical and scientific judgment shoul d be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting is 
appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be immediately 
life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the subject or may require 
intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above.  Examples 
include allergic bronchospasm, convulsions, and blood dyscrasias or development of drug 
dependency or drug abuse.  
Note:  
 Procedure s are not AE s or SAE s, but the reason for the procedure may be an AE or SAE.  
 Pre-planned (prior to signing the ICF) procedures or treatment s requiring hospitalizations 
for pre -existing conditions that do not worsen in severity are not SA Es. 
8.4.3.  Severity Assessment  
All AEs will be graded (1 to 5; see below) according to the NCI -CTCAE version 5.0: 
U31402 -A-J101 Clinical Study Protocol  
Version 9.0, 8 Nov 2022  
 
Proprietary and Confidential  
Page 117  Grade 1 Mild AE  
 Grade 2 Moderate AE  
 Grade 3 Severe AE  
 Grade 4 Life -threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated  
 Grade 5 Death related to AE  
Severity vs. Seriousne ss:  Severity is used to describe the intensity of a specific event while the 
event itself, however, may be of relatively minor medical significance (such as severe headache).  
This is not the same as "seriousness," which is based on patient/event outcome at the time of the 
event.  For example, the NCI -CTCAE Grade 4 (life -threatening consequences; urgent 
intervention indicated) is assessed based on unique clinical descriptions of severity for each AE, 
and these criteria may be different from those used for the assessment of AE seriousness.  An AE 
assessed as Grade 4 based on the NCI -CTCAE grades may or may not be assessed as serious 
based on the seriousness criteria.  
8.4.4.  Causality Assessment  
The Investigator should assess causal relationship between an AE and th e study drug on the basis 
of his/her clinical judgment and the following definitions.  The causality assessment must  be 
made based on the available information and can be updated as new information becomes 
available.  
 Related:  
 The AE follows a reasonable te mporal sequence from study drug administration 
and cannot be reasonably explained by the subject’s clinical state or other factors 
(eg, disease under study, concurrent diseases, and concomitant medications).  
or 
 The AE follows a reasonable temporal sequence  from study drug administration 
and is a known reaction to the drug under study or its chemical group or is 
predicted by known pharmacology.  
 Unrelated:  
 The AE does not follow a reasonable sequence from study drug administration or 
can be reasonably explained by the subject’s clinical state or other factors 
(eg, disease under study, concurrent diseases, and co ncomitant medications).  
8.4.5.  Action Taken Regarding Study Drug (s) 
 Dose Not Changed:  No change in study drug dosage was made.  
 Drug Withdrawn:  The st udy product was permanently stopped.  
 Dose Reduced:  The dosage of study product was reduced.  
 Drug Interrupted:  The study product was temporarily stopped.  
 Not Applicable

Proprietary and Confidential  
Page 118 8.4.6.  Other Action Taken for Event  
 None.  
 No treatment was required.  
 Medication required.  
 Prescription and/or OTC medication was required to treat the AE. 
 Hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization required.  
 Hospitalization was required or prolonged due to the AE, whether or not 
medication was required.  
 Other.  
8.4.7.  Adverse Event Outcome  
 Recover ed/Resolved  
 The subject fully recovered from the AE with no residual effect observed.  
 Recovering/Resolving  
 The AE improved but has not fully resolved.  
 Recovered/Resolved with Sequelae  
 The residual effects of the AE are still present and observable.  
 Include  sequelae/residual effects.  
 Not Recovered/Not Resolved  
 The AE itself is still present and observable.  
 Fatal  
 Fatal should be used when death is a direct outcome of the adverse event.  
 Unknown  
8.5. Serious Adverse Events  Reporting  – Procedure for Investigators  
All AEs, AESIs , events of  overdose, and SAEs  will be reported in the CRF.  
Serious events that are also efficacy endpoints (disease progression) will be exempted from SAE 
processing and expedited reporting. Disease progression should not be reported as an AE/S AE.  
However, if a subject  dies from disease progression with no other immediate causes, “disease 
progression” should be reported as an SAE and captured on designated eCRF.  
The following types of events should be reported by the Investigator in electronic data capture 
(EDC)  within 24 hours of awareness:  
 SAEs (see Section 8.4.2  for definition)  
U31402 -A-J101 Clinical Study Protocol  
Version 9.0, 8 Nov 2022  
 
Proprietary and Confidential  
Page 119  All potential ILD /pneumonitis  cases should be reported within 24 hours; including 
both serious and non -serious potential ILD /pneumonitis  cases (potential 
ILD/pneumonitis  is defined by the Event Adjudication Site Manual List of Preferred 
Terms [PTs]). 
 All hepatic events (both serious a nd non -serious, and clinical laboratory result s) which 
meet the potential Hy’s Law criteria defined as an elevated ALT or AST ≥3  × ULN 
and an elevated total bilirubin 2 × ULN that may occur simultaneously or at different 
time points during the study, rega rdless of whether these hepatic events are 
symptomatic, lead to study drug discontinuation, dose reduction or dose interruption, 
require corrective treatment, constitute an AE in the Investigator’s clinical judgment 
and/or are related to disease progressio n (see Section 8.3 for detail s). 
 Overdose, defined as the accidental or intentional administration of any dose of  study 
drug that is considered both excessive and medically important. An “excessive and 
medicall y important” overdose includes any overdose in which either an SAE, a 
non-serious AE, or no AE occurs, and is considered by the Investigator as clinically 
relevant, ie, poses an actual or potential risk to the subject.  
All events (serious and non -serious) must be reported with  Investigator’s assessment of the 
event’s seriousness, severity, and causality to the study drug. A detailed narrative summarizing 
the course of the event, including its evaluation, treatment, and outcome should be provided. 
Specific o r estimated dates of event onset, treatment, and resolution should be included when 
available. Medical history, concomitant medications, and laboratory data that are relevant to the 
event should also be summarized in the narrative. For fatal events, the na rrative should state 
whether an autopsy was or will be performed and include the results if available.  Source 
documents (including medical reports) will be retained at the study center and should not be 
submitted to the Sponsor for SAE reporting purposes.  
Urgent safety queries and follow -up information such as those upgraded to fatal/life threatening 
case must be followed up and addressed promptly.  The investigator will submit any updated 
SAE data to the CRO/sponsor within 24 hours of receipt of the infor mation.  Other f ollow -up 
information and response to non -urgent safety queries should be combined for reporting to 
provide the most complete data possible within each follow -up.  In the event that eCRF is 
unavailable, report SAEs on a Serious Adverse Event  Report (SAVER) form.  All completed 
SAVER forms must be signed by the Investigator and e -mailed or faxed to the Sponsor or the 
CRO using the provided fax transmittal form and the appropriate fax num ber provided for your 
country.  
Please call the local SAE Hotline (see Study Manual) or your study monitor for any questions on 
SAE reporting.

CRO will comply with any additional local safety reporting r equirements.  
In the US, upon receipt of the Sponsor’s notification of SUSARs that occurred with the 
investigational product, unless delegated to the Sponsor, it is the Investigator’s responsibility to 
inform the IRB per Sponsor’s instruction.  
In Japan, it is the Sponsor’s responsibility to report all the fatal/life -threatening adverse reactions 
to the regulatory authorities regardless of expectedness, and SUSARs to the regulatory 
authorities and IRB/ECs.  
8.7. Exposure in Utero During Clinical Studies  
Daiichi Sankyo must be notified of any subject or partner of a male subject who becomes 
pregnant while receiving or within 7 month s of discontinuing the study drug . 
Although pregnancy is not technically an AE, all pregnancies must be followed to conclusion  to 
determine their outcome.  This information is important for both drug safety and public health 
concerns.  It is the responsibility of the Investigator, or designee, to report an y pregnancy in a 
female subject  or a partner of a male subject  using the Ex posure In Utero (EIU) Reporting form.  
Please contact your study monitor to receive the EIU Reporting form upon learning of a 
pregnancy.  The Investigator should make every effort to follow the subject  or partner  until 
completion of the pregnancy and compl ete the EIU Reporting form with complete pregnancy 
outcome information, including normal delivery and induced abortion.  The adverse pregnancy 
outcome, either serious or non -serious, should be reported in accordance with study procedures.  
If the outcome o f the pregnancy meets the criteria for immediate classification as a SAE 
(ie, post-partum complications, spontaneous or induced abortion, stillbirth, neonatal death, or 
congenital anomaly, including that in an aborted fetus), the Investigator should follow  the 
procedures for reporting SAEs outlined in Section  8.5. 
8.8. Clinical Laboratory Evaluations  
The following clinical laboratory tests will be performed:  
Laboratory tests  Parameters  
Hematology  Red blood cell count, hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelet count, white blood

be performed during the Screening Period.   A posi tive urine pregnancy test result must 
be confirmed immediately using a serum test.  
All laboratory values must be appraised by the Investigator as to clinical significance and used to 
take appropriate clinical management measures. All abnormal laboratory va lues considered 
clinically significant by the Investigator should be recorded on the AE page of the eCRF.  If the 
abnormal laboratory value constitutes an SAE, it should be reported by the Investigator with a 
targeted questionnaire is in -built as an eCRF o r a SAVER form within 24 hours of awareness  and 
other relevant procedures must be followed (see Section  8.5).  Abnormal laboratory values 
(NCI -CTCAE Grade 3 or 4) occurring during the clinical study will be followed until repeat test 
results return to normal (or baseline), stabilize, or are no long er clinically significant.

11.1. General Statistical Considerations  
The primary analysis is to assess the efficacy, safety , and tolerability of U3-1402  in subjects with 
HER3 -positive metastatic breast cancer  and to determine the MTD/ RDE  or establish the safety 
and tolerability of the maximum administered dose of U3-1402 . 
The data cutoff for the primary analysis will occ ur after all subjects have either discontinued the 
study or have been followed for at least 9 months f ollowing the  first dose of study treatment, 
whichever is earlier. The primary analysis data cutoff may be extended if emerging data show 
responses are occ urring later. The final analysis of the study will occur after all subjects have 
discontinued from the study. Data collected beyond the primary analysis cut -off time point will 
be presented as appropriate in a Clinical Study Report (CSR) addendum .

frequency counts and percentages.  Graphical summaries  of the data may be presented.  
Assessments of change from baseline to post -treatment or the ratio of post -treatment to baseline 
will include only those subjects with both baseline and post -treatment measurements.  The last 
nonmissing value of a variable ta ken before the first dose of study drug will be used as the

11.5. Sample Size Determination  
The Dose Escalation Part of this s tudy consists of mCRM with EWOC design with at least 
3 DLT -evaluable subjects per dose level.  Sample size has been determined by practical 
considerations and n o formal statistical assessment has been performed  for the Dose Escalation 
Part. 
A total of approximately 12 subjects will be enrolled between Dose Escalation and Dose Finding 
for each of the Q3W Dosing Cohorts evaluated in Dose Finding.  For the alternative dosing 
cohorts evaluated  in Dose Finding, a total of approximately 12  subjects will be e nrolled into each 
cohort .  RDE (s) will be determined based on the risk and benefit assessment.  
For the Dose Expansion Part, there are 4 planned expansion cohorts ( HER3 -high, HR -positive  
[6.4 mg/kg], HER3 -high, HR -positive [4.8 mg /kg], HER3-low, HR -positive [6.4 mg/kg] and 
HER3 -high, TNBC  [6.4 mg /kg]): 
 Approximately 60 eligible subjects with HER3 -high, HER2 -negative, HR -positive  
disease will be randomized into 1 of 2 cohorts: 4.8 mg/kg or 6.4 mg/kg.

Page 128  Subjects with HER3 -low, HER2 -negative, HR -positive breast cancer will not be 
randomized. Approximately 20 eligible subjects in this setting will be enrolled into a 
HER3 -low, HR -positive (6.4 mg/kg) cohort . 
 Subjects with HER3 -high, TNBC  will not be randomized. Approximately 30  eligible 
subjects in this setting will be enrolled into a n HER3 -high, TNBC  (6.4 mg/kg)  cohort.  
A total of approximately 110 subjects will be enrolled into the Dose Expansion Part.  
In HER3 -high, HR -positive cohorts of the Dose Expansion Part, if target ORR is  more than 10% 
(null hypothesis: ORR  0.10,  alternative hypothesis: ORR  >0.10), then the probability of no 
response out of 30 subjects will be less than 5%.   The probability that more than 6 responders out 
of 30 subjects (ORR  >20%) are observed will be les s than 5% under the null hypothesis with 
ORR  0.10 but more than 80% under alternative hypothesis with ORR  = 0.30. 
In the HER3 -low, HR -positive  cohort of the Dose Expansion Part,  if target ORR is more than 
10% (null hypothesis: ORR 0.10, alternative hypot hesis: ORR >0.10), then the probability of 
no response out of 20 subjects will be less than 15%. The probability that more than 3 responders 
out of 20 subjects (ORR >15.0%) are observed will be less than 15% under the null hypothesis 
with ORR 0.10 but mor e than 75% under alternative hypothesis with ORR = 0.25.  
In the HER3 -high, TNBC cohort of the Dose Expansion Part, if target ORR is more than 20% 
(null hypothesis: ORR 0.20, alternative hypothesis: ORR >0.20), then the probability of no 
response out of 30 subjects will be less than 5%. The probability that more than 9 responders out 
of 30 subjects (ORR >30.0%) are observed will be less than 10% under the null hypothesis with 
ORR 0.20 but more than 80% under alternative hypothesis with ORR  = 0.40.  
The probability values for the sample size are derived based on binomial distribution using SAS® 
version 9. 4. 
11.6. Statistical Analysis Process  
The clinical study will be analyzed by  DS or its agent/CRO followed by this protocol, and SAP 
which will demonstrate all methodologies and displays/shells for statistical analyses.  
The SAP will provide the statistical methods and definitions for the analysis of the efficacy and 
safety data, as  well as describe the approaches to be taken for summarizing other clinical study 
information such as subject disposition, demographic and baseline characteristics, study drug 
exposure, and prior and concomitant medications.  The SAP will also include a de scription of 
how missing, unused, and spurious data will be addressed.  
To preserve the integrity of the statistical analysis and clinical study conclusions, the SAP will be 
finalized prior to database lock.  
All statistical analyses will be performed using SAS® Version  9.3 or higher (SAS Institute, Cary, 
NC 27513).

Page 129 11.7. Specification of Modified Continuous Reassessment Method with 
Escalation with Overdose Control  
11.7.1.  Bayesian Logistic Regression Model for Modified Continuous Reassessment 
Method  
The dose -toxicity rel ationship for mCRM with EWOC principle will be described by following  
2-parameter BLRM:  
logit(π(d)) = log(α) + β log(d/d*), α>0, β>0  
where logit(π(d))  = ln (π(d)/(1 -π(d))), π(d) is the probability of a DLT or the DLT rate at dose d.  
Doses are rescaled as d/d* with the reference dose d* = 9.7 mg/kg.  As a consequence , log(α) is 
equal to logit(π(d*)) at dose d*.  Note that for a dose equal to zero, the pr obability of toxicity is 
zero.  
11.7.2.  Prior Specification for Bayesian Logistic Regression Model Parameters  
The Bayesian approach requires the specification of a prior distribution for the BLRM 
parameters.  A minimally -informative bivariate normal prior for the m odel parameters 
(log(α),log(β)) is obtained as follows21: 
 Based on extrapolation of nonclinical t oxicology studies in monkeys, the MTD is 
projected to be greater than 9.7 mg/kg in humans (the HNSTD of monkeys is 
30 mg/kg and assuming humans and monkeys are equally sensitive, the MTD is 
projected to be greater than 9.7 mg/kg in humans). The median prio r probabilities of 
DLT are set to be approximately 8.0% and 24.5% at 1.6 mg/kg (projected starting dose 
for dose escalation using mCRM) and at 9.7 mg/kg, respectively.  
 For the remaining doses, the medians of probability of DLT are assumed linear in log-
dose on the logit -scale.  
 Base d on the above medians for the probability of DLT at each dose and wide prior 
credible intervals (obtained from minimally informative Beta distributions), the 
optimal parameters of the bivariate normal distribution can be o btained as follows:  
Parameters  Means  Standard deviations  Correlation  
log(α), log(β)  (-1.0981 , -0.4913 ) (2.0445 , 0.8677 ) -0.3317  
11.7.3.  Escalation with Overdose Control Principle  
Dose recommendation for the next cohort will be based on summaries of the posterior 
probability of the DLT rate for provisional doses: 1.6, 3.2, 4.8, 6.4, and 8.0 mg/kg.  After 
subjects of each cohort complete DLT evaluation during Cycle 1, the posterior d istributions of 
the DLT rate are derived for all provisional dose levels based on the BLRM using the DLT 
outcome data from all assessed doses and a pre -specified prior distribution for the model 
parameters.  The posterior probability of the DLT rate in the  following 4 intervals at each dose 
level will then be calculated: 0%  ≤DLT rate ≤16% as the DLT rate interval for under -dosing, 
16% <DLT rate ≤33% as the target DLT rate interval, 33%  <DLT rate ≤60% as the DLT rate 
interval for excessive toxicity, and 60%  <DLT rate ≤100% as the DLT rate interval for

Page 130 unacceptable toxicity, and used for dose recommendation for the next cohort according to the 
EWOC principle.  The above provisional doses are based on an initial estimate of the human 
MTD of 9.7 mg/kg using the HNSTD of monkey s in nonclinical toxicology studies  (30 mg/kg ).  
It is therefore conceivable that the posterior probability of DLT rate for dose recommendation 
may be generated using alternative provisional doses as long as the predicted exposure  
increments are no more than 100% ( Section  3.1.3 ). 
The EWOC principle requires that the mCRM recommended dose for the next cohort of subjects 
is the  one with the highest posterior probability of the DLT rate in the target DLT rate interval of 
16% <DLT rate ≤33% among all doses fulfilling the overdose control constraint: there is less 
than 25% of  probability for the DLT rate > 33% (probability for exces sive or unacceptable 
toxicity).

The Investigator/investigational site will permit study -related monitoring, audits, IRB/IEC 
review and regulatory inspections by providing direct access to source data/documents.  Direct 
access includes permission to examine, analyze, verify, and reproduce any records and reports 
that are important to the evaluation of a clinical study.  
12.1. Monitoring and Inspections  
The CRO  monitor and regulatory authority inspectors are responsible for contacting and visiting 
the Investigator for the purpose of inspecting the facilities and, upon request, inspecting the 
various records of the study (eg, CRFs, source data, and other pertinen t documents).  
The verification  of adherence to the protocol; completeness, accuracy, and consistency of  the 
data; and adherence to ICH  Good Clinical Practice (GCP ) and local regulations on the conduct of 
clinical research  will be accomplished through a com bination of onsite visits by the monitor and 
review of study data remotely.   The frequency of the monitoring visit will vary based on the 
activity at each site.  The monitor is responsible for inspecting the CRFs and ensuring 
completeness of the study esse ntial documents.  The monitor should have access to subject 
medical records and other study -related records needed to verify the entries on the CRFs.   
Detailed information is provided in the monitoring plan.  
The monitor will communicate deviations from the  protocol, SOPs, GCP , and applicable 
regulations to the Investigator and will ensure that appropriate action  (s) designed to prevent 
recurrence of the detected deviations is taken and documented.  
The Investigator agrees to cooperate with the monitor to ens ure that any problems detected in the 
course of these monitoring visits are addressed  to the satisfaction of the Sponsor  and 
documented.  
In accordance with ICH GCP and the Sponsor’s audit plans, this study site may be selected for 
audit by representatives from the Sponsor.  Audit  of site facilities (eg, pharmacy, drug storage 
areas, laboratories) and review of study related records will occur in order to evaluate the study 
conduct and compliance with the protocol, ICH GCP, and applicable regulatory requirements.   
The Investigator should r espond to audit findings.   In the event that a regulatory authority 
informs the Investigator that it intends to conduct an inspection, the Sponsor shall be notified 
immediately.  
12.2. Data Collection  
The Investigator or study staff will enter the data in the eCR F (see Section  17.6) in accordance 
with the CRF Completion Guidelines that are provided by the Sponsor.  
eCRF completion should be kept current to ena ble the monitor to review the subject’s status 
throughout the course of the study.  The eCRF will be completed, reviewed and signed off or 
e-signed by the Investigator  after all queries have been satisfactorily resolved.

Spons or or CRO .  Data will be vetted both electronically and manually for CRFs and the data 
will be electronically vetted by programmed data rules within the application.  Queries generated 
by rules and raised by reviewers will b e generated within the Electronic Data Capture  (EDC ) 
application.  During this review, subject data will be checked for consistency, completeness , and 
any apparent discrepancies.   To resolve any questions arising from the Clinical  Data 
Management review pr ocess for eCRFs queries will be raised and resol ved within the EDC 
application.  
Data received from external sources such as central lab oratorie s will be reconciled to the clinical 
database.  
SAE s in the clinical database will be reconciled with the safety database.  
All medical and surgical history  and Adverse Even ts will be coded using Medical Dictionary for 
Regulatory Activities  (MedDRA ). All prior cancer therapy and prior/concomitant medications 
entered into the database will be coded by using the latest version of World Health Organization 
Drug Dictionary.  
12.4. Study Documentation and Storage  
The Investigator will maintain a Signature List of appropriately qualified persons to whom 
he/she has delegated study duties.  All persons authorized to make entries and/ or corrections on 
CRFs will be included on the Signature List.  
Investigators will maintain a confidential screening log of all potential study candidates that 
includes limited information of the subjects, date and outcome of screening process.  
Investigator s will be expected to maintain an Enrollment Log of all subjects enrolled in the study 
indicating their assigned study number.  
Investigators will maintain a confidential subject identification code list.  This confidential list of 
names of all subjects all ocated to study numbers on enrolling in the study allows the Investigator 
to reveal the identity of any subject when necessary.  
Source documents are original documents, data, and records from which the subject’s CRF data 
are obtained.  These include but ar e not limited to hospital records, clinical and office charts, 
laboratory and pharmacy records, diaries, microfiches, X -rays, and correspondence.  
Records of subjects, source documents, monitoring visit logs, data correction forms, CRFs, 
inventory of study drug, regulatory documents ( eg, protocol and amendments, IRB/EC 
correspondence and approvals, approved and signed ICFs, Investigator’s Agreement, clinical

to the study must be kept in appropriate study files at the study site (Trial Master File) .  Source 
documents include all recordings and observations or notations of clinical activities and all 
reports and records necessary for the evaluation and reconstruction of the clinical study.  These 
records will be retained in a secure file for the peri od required by the institution or study site 
policy.  Prior to transfer or destruction of these records, the Sponsor must be notified in writing 
and be given the opportunity to further store such records.  
12.5. Record Keeping  
The Investigator and study staff are  responsible for maintaining a comprehensive and centralized 
filing system (Trial Master File) of all study -related documentation, suitable for inspection at any 
time by representatives from the Sponsor and/or applicable regulatory authorities.  Trial Mast er 
File include s: 
 Subject files containing completed CRFs, ICFs, and supporting copies of source 
documentation (if kept).  
 Study files containing the protocol with all amendments, Investigator’s Brochure, 
copies of relevant essential documents required prio r to commencing a clinical study, 
and all correspondence to and from the IRB/ EC and the Sponsor.  
 Records related to the study drug(s) including acknowledgment of receipt at site, 
accountability records , final reconciliation , and applicable correspondence.  
In addition, all original source documents supporting entries in the CRFs must be maintained and 
be readily available.  
Trial Master File  will be retained by the Investigator until at least 3 years after the last approval 
of a marketing application in an IC H region and until there are no pending or contemplated 
marketing applications in an ICH region or at least 3 years have lapsed since the formal 
discontinuation of clinical development of the investigational drug.  These documents should be 
retained for a longer period, however, if required by the applicable regulatory requirements or by 
an agreement with the Sponsor.  It is the responsibility of the Sponsor to inform the 
Investigator/institution as to when these documents no longer need to be retained.  
Subject’s medical files should be retained in accordance with applicable legislation and in 
accordance with the maximum period of time permitted by the hospital, institution , or private 
practice.  
No study document should be destroyed without prior written agreement between Sponsor and 
the Investigator.  Should the Investigator wish to assign the study records to another party or 
move them to another location, he/she must notify Sponsor in writing of the new responsible 
person and/or the new location.

15.1. Compliance Statement, Ethics and Regulatory Compliance  
This study will be conducted in compliance with the protocol, the ethical principles tha t have 
their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki, the ICH consolidated Guideline E6 for Good Clinical 
Practice (GCP) (CPMP/ICH/135/95) , and applicable regulatory requirement(s) including the 
following:  
 US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) GCP Regulations:  Code of Federal 
Regulations (CFR) Title 21, parts 11, 50, 54, 56 and 312, as appropriate.  
 Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare Ordinance No. 28 of 27 Mar 1997.  
 The Act on Securing Quality, E fficacy and Safety of Pharmaceuticals, Medical 
Devices, Regenerative and Cellular Therapy Products, Gene Therapy Products, and 
Cosmetics No. 1 of 25 Nov 2014.  
 Other applicable local regulations.  
15.2. Subject Confidentiality  
The Investigators and the Sponsor wil l preserve the confidentiality of all subjects taking part in 
the study, in accordance with GCP and local regulations.  
The Investigator must ensure that the subject’s anonymity is maintained.  On the CRFs or other 
documents submitted to the Sponsor or the CRO, subjects should be identified by a unique 
Subject Numb er as designated by the Sponsor.  Documents that are not for submission to the 
Sponsor or the CRO ( eg, signed ICF) should be kept in strict confidence by the Investigator.  
In compliance with ICH GC P Guidelines, it is required that the Investigator and institution 
permit authorized representatives of the company, of the regulatory agency(s), and the IRB/EC 
direct access to review the subject’s original medical records for verification of study -relate d 
procedures and data.  The Investigator is obligated to inform the subject that his/her study -related 
records will be reviewed by the above -named  representatives without violating the 
confidentiality of the subject.  
15.3. Informed Consent  
Before a subject’s par ticipation in the study, it is the Investigator’s responsibility to obtain freely 
given consent, in writing, from the subject after adequate explanation of the aims, methods, 
anticipated benefits, and potential hazards of the study and before any protocol -specific 
screening procedures or any study drugs are administered.  ICF for examination of tumor tissue 
will be prepared in a separate ICF.  Subjects should be given the opportunity to ask questions and 
receive satisfactory answers to their inquiries and  should have adequate time to decide whether 
or not to participate in the study.  The written ICF should be prepared in the local language(s) of 
the potential subject population.  
In obtaining and documenting informed consent, the Investigator should comply w ith the 
applicable regulatory requirements, and should adhere to GCP and to the ethical principles that 
U31402 -A-J101 Clinical Study Protocol  
Version 9.0, 8 Nov 2022  
 
Proprietary and Confidential  
Page 137 have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.  The consent form and any revision(s) should be 
approved by the IRB prior to being provided to potentia l subjects.  
The subject’s wri tten informed consent  should be documented in the subject’s medical records.  
The ICF should be signed and personally dated by the subject, and by the person who conducted 
the informed consent discussion (not necessarily the In vestigator).  The original signed ICF 
should be retained in accordance with institutional policy, and a copy of the signed consent form 
should be provided to the subject.  The date and time (if applicable ) that informed consent was 
given should be recorded on the eCRF.  
If the subject cannot read, then according to ICH GCP Guideline, Section 4.8.9, an impartial 
witness should be present during the entire informed consent discussion.  This witness should 
sign the ICF after the subject has consented to the subject’s participation and, if possible, signed 
the ICF.  By signing the ICF, the witness attests that the information in the ICF and any other 
written information was adequately explained to and apparently u nderstood by the subject and 
that informed consent was freely given by the subject.  
Suggested model text for the ICF for the study and any applicable subparts (genomic, PK, etc.) is 
provided in the Sponsor ICF template for the Investigator to prepare the d ocuments to be used at 
his or her site.  
For study site in the US, an additional con sent is required for the HIPAA.  
15.4. Regulatory Compliance  
The study protocol, subject information and consent form, the Investigator ’s Brochure, any 
subject written instructions  to be given to the subject, available safety information, subject 
recruitment procedures (eg, advertisements), information about payments and compensation 
available to the subjects and documentation evidencing the Investigator’s qualifications should 
be submitted to the IRB for ethical review and approval according to local regulations , prior to 
the study initiation .  The written approval should identify all documents reviewed by name and 
version.  
Changes in the conduct of the study or planned analysis wil l be documented in a protocol 
amendment and/or the SAP.  
The Investigator must submit and, where necessary, obtain approval from the IRB and/ or 
Sponsor  for all subsequent protocol amendments and changes to the informed consent document 
or changes of the in vestigational site, facilities or personnel.  The Investigator should notify the 
IRB of deviations from the protocol or SAE s occurring at the site and other AE reports received 
from Sponsor /CRO , in accordance with local procedures.  
As required by local reg ulations, the Sponsor’s local Regulatory Affairs group or representative 
to whom this responsibility has been delegated will insure all legal aspects are covered, and 
approval of the appropriate regulatory bodies obtained, prior to study initiation . If cha nges to the 
initial protocol and other relevant study documents are made, this representative will also ensure 
that any revised documents required for submission are submitted to regulatory authorities and 
implementation of these changes happen only after approval by the relevant  regulatory bodies, as 
required.

Page 138 In the event of any prohibition or restriction imposed ( eg, clinical hold) by an applicable 
Regulatory Authority(ies) in any area of the world, or if the Investigator is aware of any new 
information which might influence the evaluation of the benefits and risks of the investigational 
drug, the Sponsor s hould be informed immediately.  
In addition, the Investigator will inform the Sponsor immediately of any urgent safety measures 
taken by the Investigato r to protect the study subjects against any immediate hazard, and of any 
suspected/actual serious GCP non -compliance that the Investigator becomes aware of.  
15.5. Protocol Deviations  
The Investigator should conduct the study in compliance with the protocol agree d to by Sponsor 
and, if required, by the regulatory authority(ies), and which was given approval/favorable 
opinion by the IRB/IEC.  
A deviation to any protocol procedure or waiver to any stated criteria will not be allowed in this 
study except where necessa ry to eliminate immediate hazard(s) to the subject.  Sponsor must be 
notified of all intended or unintended deviations to the protocol ( eg, inclusion/exclusion criteria, 
dosing, missed study visits) on an expedited basis.  
The Investigator, or person design ated by the Investigator, should document and explain any 
deviation from the approved protocol.  
If a subject was ineligible or received the incorrect dose or study treatment, and had at least 
1 administration of study drug, data should be collected for saf ety purposes.  
If applicable, the Investigator should notify the IRB of deviations from the protocol in 
accordance with local procedures.  
15.6. Supply of New Information Affecting the Conduct of the Stud y 
When new information becomes available that may adversely affect the safety of subjects or the 
conduct of the study, the Sponsor will inform all Investigators involved in the clinical study, 
IRBs/ ECs, and regulatory authorities of such information, and when needed, will amend the 
protocol and/or subject informati on. 
The Investigator should immediately inform the subject whenever new information becomes 
available that may be relevant to the subject’s consent or may influence the subject’s willingness 
to continue participation in the study.  The communication should  be documented on medical 
records, for example, and it should be confirmed whether the subject is willing to remain in the 
study.  
If the subject information is revised, it must be re -approved by the I RB/EC.  The Investigator 
should obtain written informed consent to continue participation with the revised written 
information even if subjects were already informed of the relevant information.  The Investigator 
or other responsible personnel who provided explanations and the subject should sign and date 
the revised ICF.

Any amendments to the study protocol that seem to be appropriate as the study progresses will 
be communicated to the Investigator by Daiichi Sankyo  or the CRO .  Also, the Sponsor will 
ensure the timely submission of amendments to regulatory authorities.  
Changes made by protocol  amendments will be documented in a Summary of Changes 
document.  These protocol amendments will undergo the same review and approval process as 
the original protocol.  
A protocol amendment may b e implemented after it has been approved by the IRB/EC and by 
regulatory authorities  where appropriate, unless immediate implementation of the change is 
necessary for subject safety.

17.4. Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, Version 1.1  
Tumor response will be assessed in a ccordance with the RECIST v1.1,  described below.   The 
details will be described in the Independent Review Charter developed by the imaging CRO  
selected by the Sponsor.  
17.4.1.  Measurability of Tumor at Baseline  
17.4.1.1.  Definitions  
At ba seline, tumor lesions/lymph nodes will be categorized measurable or non -measurable as 
follows:  
17.4.1.1.1.  Measurable  
 Tumor lesions:  Must be accurately measured in at least 1 dimension (longest diameter 
in the plane of measurement is to be recorded) with a minimum si ze of:  
 10 mm by CT scan (CT scan slice thickness no greater than 5 mm)  
 10 mm caliper measurement by clinical exam (lesions which cannot be accurately 
measured with calipers should be recorded as non -measurable)  
 20 mm by chest X -ray 
 Measurable malignant lymph nodes:  To be considered pathologically enlarged and 
measurable, a lymph node must be 15 mm in short axis when assessed by CT scan 
(CT scan slice thickness recommended to be no greater than 5  mm).  At baseline and 
in F/U, only t he short axis will be measured and followed.  See also notes below on 
“Baseline documentation of target and non -target lesions” for information on lymph 
node measurement.  
U31402 -A-J101 Clinical Study Protocol  
Version 9.0, 8 Nov 2022  
 
Proprietary and Confidential  
Page 149 17.4.1.1.2.  Non-measurable  
All other lesions, including sm all lesions (longest diameter < 10 mm or  pathological lymph nodes 
with 10 to < 15 mm short axis), as well as truly non -measurable lesions.  Lesions considered 
truly non -measurable include:  leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural or pericardial effusion, 
inflammatory breast disease, lymphangiti c involvement of skin or lung, and abdominal 
masses/abdominal organomegaly identified by physical exam that is not measurable by 
reproducible imaging techniques.  
17.4.1.1.3.  Special Considerations Regarding Lesion Measurability  
Bone lesions, cystic lesions, and lesions previously treated with local therapy require particular 
comment.  
17.4.1.1.3.1.  Bone Lesions  
 Bone scan, positron emission tomography (PET) scan or plain films are not 
considered adequate imaging techniques to measure bone lesions.  However, these 
techniques can be used to confirm the presence or disappearance of bone lesions.  
 Lytic bone lesions or mixed lytic -blastic lesions, with identifiable soft tissue 
components, that can be evaluated by cross -sectional imaging techniques such as CT 
or MRI can be considered a s measurable lesions if the soft tissue component meets 
the definition of measurability described above.  
 Blastic bone lesions are non -measurable.  
17.4.1.1.3.2.  Cystic Lesions  
 Lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple cysts should not be 
consider ed as malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non -measurable) since they 
are, by definition, simple cysts.  
 “Cystic lesions” thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered as 
measurable lesions, if they meet the definition of measurability descr ibed above.  
However, if noncystic lesions are present in the same subject, these are preferred for 
selection as target lesions.  
17.4.1.1.3.3.  Lesions with Prior Local Treatment  
 Tumor lesions situated in a previously irradiated area, or in an area subjected to other 
loco-regional therapy, are not considered measurable unless there has been 
demonstra ted progression in the lesion.  
17.4.1.2.  Specifications by Methods of Measurements  
17.4.1.2.1.  Measurement of Lesions  
All measurements should be recorded in metric notation, using calipers if clini cally assessed.  All 
baseline evaluations should be performed as close as possible to the treatment start and NEVER 
more than 28 day s of the first dose of study drug  administration .

Version 9.0, 8 Nov 2022  
 
Proprietary and Confidential  
Page 150 17.4.1.2.2.  Method of Assessment  
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each 
identified and reported lesion at baseline and during F/U.  Imaging based evaluation should 
always be performed rather than clinical examination unless the lesion(s) being followed cannot 
be imaged but are assessable by clinical exam.  
CT, MRI: CT is the best currently available and reproducible method to measure lesions selected 
for response assessment.  This guideline has defined measurability of lesions on CT scan based 
on the assumption that CT slice thickness is 5 mm or less.  When CT scans have slice thickness 
greater than 5 mm, the minimum size for a measurable lesion should be twice the slice thickness.  
MRI is also acceptable in certain si tuations (eg,  for body scans).  
17.4.2.  Tumor Response Evaluation  
17.4.2.1.  Assessment of Overal l Tumor Burden and Measurable Disease  
To assess objective response or future progression, it is necessary to estimate the overall tumor 
burden at baseline and use this as a comparato r for subsequent measurements.  
Only subjects with measurable disease at ba seline should be included in the study.  
17.4.2.2.  Baseline Documentation of “Target” and “Non -target” Lesions  
When more than 1 measurable lesion is present at baseline, all lesions up to a maximum of 
5 lesions total (representative of all involved organs) should be identified as target lesions and 
will be recorded and measured at baseline (this means in instances where subjects have only 1 or 
2 organ sites involved a maximum of 2 and 4 lesions respectively will be recorded).  
Target lesions should be selected on the b asis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter), be 
representative of all involved organs, but in addition should be those that lend themselves to 
reproducible repeated measurements.  It may be the case that, on occasion, the largest lesion does 
not lend itself to reproducible measurement in which circumstance the next largest lesion which 
can be measured reproducibly should be selected.  
Lymph nodes merit special mention since they are normal anatomical structures which may be 
visible by imaging even if not involved by tumor.  As noted above, pathological nodes which are 
defined as measurable and may be identified as target lesions must me et the criterion of a short 
axis of 15 mm by CT scan.  Only the short axis of these nodes will contribute to the baseline 
sum.  The short axis of the node is the diameter normally used by radiologists to judge if a node 
is involved by solid tumor.  Nodal size is normally reported as 2 dimensions in the plane in 
which the image is obtained (for CT scan this is almost always the axial plane; for MRI the plane 
of acquisition may be axial, sagittal, or coronal).  The smaller of these measures is the short axis .  
For example, an abdominal node which is reported as being 20 mm × 30 mm has a short axis of 
20 mm and qualifies as a malignant, measurable node.  In this example, 20 mm should be 
recorded as the node measurement.  All other pathological nodes (those wit h short axis 10 mm 
but < 15 mm) should be considered non -target lesions.  Nodes that have a short axis < 10 mm are 
considered non -pathological and should not be recorded or followed.  
U31402 -A-J101 Clinical Study Protocol  
Version 9.0, 8 Nov 2022  
 
Proprietary and Confidential  
Page 151 A sum of the diameters (longest for non -nodal lesions, short axis for noda l lesions) for all target 
lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum diameters.  If lymph nodes are to be 
included in the sum, then as noted above, only the short axis is added into the sum.  The baseline 
sum diameters will be used as refe rence to further characteri ze any objective tumor regression in 
the measurable dimension of the disease.  
All other lesions (or sites of disease) including pathological lymph nodes should be identified as 
non-target lesions and should also be recorded at ba seline.  Measurements are not required and 
these lesions should be followed as “present,” “absent,” or in rare cases “unequivocal 
progression.”  In addition, it is possible to record multiple non -target lesions involving the same 
organ as a single item on the case record form (eg, “multiple enlarged pelvic lymph nodes” or  
“multiple liver metastases”).  
17.4.2.3.  Response Criteria  
This section provides the definitions of the criteria used to determine objective tumor response 
for target lesions.  
17.4.2.3.1.  Evaluation of Target Le sions  
CR:  Disappearance of all target lesions.  Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or 
non-target) must ha ve reduction in short axis to < 10 mm.  
PR:  At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the 
baseli ne sum diameters.  
PD:  At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the 
smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study).  In 
addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum  must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at 
least 5 mm.   
SD:  Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, 
taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study.  
17.4.2.3.2.  Special Notes on the Assessment of  Target Lesions  
Lymph nodes:  Lymph nodes identified as target lesions should always have the actual short 
axis measurement recorded (measured in the same anatomical plane as the baseline 
examination), even if the nodes regress to below 10 mm on study.  This means that when lymph 
nodes are included as target lesions, the “sum” of lesions may not be zero even if CR criteria are 
met, since a normal lymph node is defi ned as having a short axis of < 10 mm.  For PR, SD, and 
PD, the actual short axis measurement  of the nodes is to be included in the sum of target lesions.  
Target lesions that become “too small to measure”:  While on study, all lesions (nodal and 
non-nodal) recorded at baseline should have their actual measurements recorded at each 
subsequent evalu ation, even when very small (eg, 2 mm).  However, sometimes lesions or lymph 
nodes which are recorded as target lesions at baseline become so faint on CT scan that the 
radiologist may not feel comfortable assigning an exact measure and may report them as b eing 
“too small to measure.”  When this occurs, it is important that a value be recorded on the eCRF.  
If it is the opinion of the radiologist that the lesion has likely disappeared, the measurement 
U31402 -A-J101 Clinical Study Protocol  
Version 9.0, 8 Nov 2022  
 
Proprietary and Confidential  
Page 152 should be recorded as 0 mm.  If the lesion is believed to  be present and is faintly seen but too 
small to measure, a default value of 5  mm should be assigned ( note:  it is less likely that this rule 
will be used for lymph nodes since they usually have a definable size when normal and are 
frequently surrounded by  fat such as in the retroperitoneum; however, if a lymph node is 
believed to be present and is faintly seen but too small to measure, a default value of 5 mm 
should be assigned in this circumstance as well).  This default value is derived from the 5 mm 
CT slice thickness (but should not be changed with varying CT slice thickness).  The 
measurement of these lesions is potentially non -reproducible, therefore providing this default 
value will prevent false responses or progressions based upon measurement error .  To reiterate, 
however, if the radiologist is able to provide an actual measure, that should be recorded, even if 
it is below 5 mm.  
Lesions that split or coalesce on treatment:  When non -nodal lesions “fragment,” the longest 
diameters of the fragmented p ortions should be added together to calculate the target lesion sum.  
Similarly, as lesions coalesce, a plane between them may be maintained that would aid in 
obtaining maximal diameter measurements of each individual lesion.  If the lesions have truly 
coalesced such that they are no longer separable, the vector of the longest diameter in this 
instance should be the maximal longest diameter for the “coalesced lesion.”  
17.4.2.3.3.  Evaluation of Non -target Lesions  
This section provides the definitions of the criteria use d to determine the tumor response for the 
group of non -target lesions.  While some non -target lesions may actually be measurable, they 
need not be measured and instead should be assessed only qualitatively at the time points 
specified in the protocol . 
CR:  Disappearance of all non -target lesions.  All lymph nodes must  be non -pathological in size 
(<10 mm short axis).  
Non-CR/Non -PD:  Persistence of 1 or more non -target lesion(s) and/or maintenance of tumor 
marker level above the normal limits.  
PD:  Unequivoca l progression (see comments below) of existing non -target lesions.  
17.4.2.3.4.  Special Notes on Assessment of Progression of Non -target Disease  
The concept of progression of non -target disease requires additional explanation as follows : 
When the subject also has measu rable disease :  In this setting, to achieve “unequivocal 
progression” on the basis of the non -target disease, there must be an overall level of substantial 
worsening in non -target disease such that, even in presence of SD or PR in target disease, the 
overa ll tumor burden has increased sufficiently to merit discontinuation of therapy.  A modest 
“increase” in the size of 1 or more non -target lesions is usually not sufficient to quality for 
unequivocal progression status.  The designation of overall progressio n solely on the basis of 
change in non -target disease in the face of SD or PR of target disease wil l therefore be extremely 
rare. 
When the subject has only non -measurable disease:   The same general concepts apply here as 
noted above, however, in this insta nce there is no measurable disease assessment to factor into 
the interpretation of an increase in non -measurable disease burden.  Because worsening in 
U31402 -A-J101 Clinical Study Protocol  
Version 9.0, 8 Nov 2022  
 
Proprietary and Confidential  
Page 153 non-target disease cannot be easily quantified (by definition: if all lesions are truly 
non-measurable) a  useful test that can be applied when assessing subjects for unequivocal 
progression is to consider if the increase in overall disease burden based on the change in 
non-measurable disease is comparable in magnitude to the increase that would be required to  
declare PD for measurable disease ( ie, an increase in tumor burden representing an additional 
73% increase in ‘volume’ [which is equivalent to a 20% increase diameter in a measurable 
lesion]).  If ‘unequivocal progression’ is seen, the subject should be c onsidered to have had 
overall PD at that point.  While it would be ideal to have objective criteria to apply to 
non-measurable disease, the very nature of that disease makes it impossible to do so, therefore 
the increase must be substantial.  
17.4.2.3.5.  New Lesions  
The appearance of new malignant lesions denotes disease progression; therefore, some 
comments on detection of new lesions are important.  There are no specific criteria for the 
identification of new radiographic lesions; however, the finding of a new lesion should be 
unequivocal: ie, not attributable to differences in scanning technique, change in imaging 
modality or findings thought to represent something other than tumor (for  example, some “new” 
bone lesions may be simply healing or flare of preexisting les ions).  This is particularly 
important when the subject’s baseline lesions show PR or CR.  For example, necrosis of a liver 
lesion may be reported on a CT scan report as a “new” cystic lesion, which it is not.  
A lesion identified on a F/U study in an anato mical location that was not scanned at baseline is 
considered a new lesion and will indicate disease progression.  An example of this is the subject 
who has visceral disease at baseline and while on study has a CT or MRI brain ordered which 
reveals metasta ses.  The subject’s brain metastases are considered to be evidence of PD even if 
he/she did not h ave brain imaging at baseline.  
If a new lesion is equivocal, for example because of its small size, continued therapy and F/U 
evaluation will clarify if it rep resents truly new disease.  If repeat scans confirm there is 
definitely a new lesion, then progression should be declared using  the date of the initial scan.  
17.4.2.4.  Evaluation of Best Overall Response  
 Best response in this study is defined as the best response across all time points (eg, a subject 
who has SD at first assessment, PR at second assessment, and PD on last assessment has a best 
overall response of SD).  When SD is believed to be best respon se, it must also meet the protocol 
specified minimum time from baseline, 6 weeks (±  7 days).  If the minimum time is not met 
when SD is otherwise the best time point response, the subject’s best response depends on the 
subsequent assessments.  For example, a subject who has SD at first assessment, PD at second 
and does not meet minimum duration for SD, will have a best response of PD.  The same subject 
lost to follow -up after the first SD assessment would be considered inevaluable.  
The subject’s  best overall response assignment will depend on the findings of both target and 
non-target disease and will also take into consideration the appearance of new lesions.

It is assumed that at each protocol -specified time point, a respons e assessment occurs.  
Table  17.5 provides a summary of the overall response status calculation at each time point for 
subjects who have measurable disea se at baseline.  
When subjects have non -measurable (therefore non -target) disease only, Table  17.6 is to be used.

17.4.2.4.2.  Missing Assessments and Inevaluable Designation  
When no imaging/measurement is performed at all at a particular time  point, the subject is not 
evaluable  (NE)  at that time  point.  If only a subset of lesion measurements are made at an 
assessment, usually the case is also considered NE at that time  point, unless a convincing 
argument can be made that the contribution of the individual missing lesion(s) would not change 
the as signed time point response.  This would be most likely to happen in the case of PD.  For 
example, if a subject had a baseline sum of 50 mm with 3  measured lesions and at F/U only 
U31402 -A-J101 Clinical Study Protocol  
Version 9.0, 8 Nov 2022  
 
Proprietary and Confidential  
Page 155 2 lesions were assessed, but those gave a sum of 80 mm, the subject will have  achieved PD 
status, regardless of the contr ibution of the missing lesion.  
17.4.2.4.3.  Best Overall Response: All Time Points  
The best overall response is determined once all the data for the subject is known.  
Best response determination in this study where confirmati on of CR or PR IS NOT required: 
Best response in th is study is defined as the best response across all time points (eg, a subject 
who has SD at first assessment, PR at second assessment, and PD on last assessment has a best 
overall response of PR).  When S D is believed to be best response, it must also meet the protocol 
specified minimum time from baseline, 6  weeks  (± 1 week) .  If the minimum time is not met 
when SD is otherwise the best time point response, the subject’s best response depends  on the 
subseq uent assessments.  
17.4.2.4.4.  Special Notes on Response Assessment  
When nodal disease is included in the sum of target lesions and the nod es decrease to “normal” 
size (< 10 mm), they may still have a measurement reported on scans.  This measurement should 
be recorded e ven though the nodes are normal in order not to overstate progression should it be 
based on increase in size of the nodes.  As noted earlier, this means that subjects with CR may 
not have a total sum of “zero” on the eCRF.  
Subjects with a global deteriorat ion of health status requiring discontinuation of treatment 
without objective evidence of disease progression at that time should be reported as 
“symptomatic deterioration.”  Every effort should be made to document objective progression 
even after disconti nuation of treatment.  Symptomatic deterioration is not a descriptor of an 
objective response: it is a reason for stopping study therapy.  The objective response status of 
such subjects is to be determined by evaluation of target and non -target disease.  
For equivocal findings of progression (eg, very small and uncertain new lesions; cystic changes 
or necrosis in existing lesions), treatment may continue until the next scheduled assessment.  If at 
the next scheduled assessment, progression is confirmed, the date of progression should be the 
earlier date when progression was suspected.  
17.4.2.5.  Frequency of Tumor Re -evaluation  
In this study, tumor measurement will be conducted every 6 weeks in the first 24 weeks after 
Day 1 of Cycle 1 and thereafter every 12 weeks whil e the subject remains on study until 
progression of disease, withdrawal of consent, death, or loss to F/U.  Scan dates should not be 
adjusted or rescheduled due to dose delay of any type.  
Baseline tumor assessments must be performed within 28 days of the f irst dose of study drug 
administration.  
All efforts should be made to ensure consistency between the baseline measurements and all 
subsequent measurements in reference to utilization of scanning method, equipment, technique 
(including slice thickness and f ield of view), and radiographic interpreter.  
The radiographic evaluation must include CT or MRI scanning of the brain, chest, abdomen, and 
pelvis  at screening period.  Any additional suspected sites of disease should also be imaged.

Page 156 Every effort should be  made to use the same assessment modality for all assessments for each 
subject.   However, if there is no brain metastasis at the time of screening, CT or MRI should 
only be done when symptoms associated with brain metastasis occur  during study period .  If no 
clinical symptoms are observed, brain CT or MRI is not mandatory  during study period .  All 
evaluations should meet the standard of care for imaging of lesions in the respective organ(s) and 
should conform to the image acquisition guidelines according to  institutional standards.  
All target and non -target sites are evaluated at each time point of tumor assessment.

Page 170 17.9. Instructions Related to Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID -19) 
Due to the potential impact of coronavirus disease 2019  (COVID -19, due to severe acute 
respiratory syndrome coro navirus 2 [SARS CoV -2]), on subject safety, the Sponsor recommends 
the following dose modification and management plan for subjects with confirmed or suspected 
COVID -19 while being treated with U3-1402 .  Dose modifications will be based on the worst 
CTCAE grade.  Use CTCAE v ersion 5.0 general grading criteria to evaluate COVID -19.  All 
dose modifications  (discontinuation, interruptions or reductions)  must be recorded on the AE and 
drug administration eCRFs . 
Dose Modification Criteria for Suspected or Confirmed COVID -19 
If COVID -19 infection is suspected, interrupt  U3-1402 and rule out COVID -19 per local 
guidance.  
 If COVID -19 is ruled out, follow  dose modification and management guidance  as 
outlined in Table  5.2. 
 If COVID -19 is confirmed or is still suspected after evaluation  follow dose 
modification as outlined in Table  17.11 below and manage COVID -19 per local 
guidance until recovery of COVID -19.  COVID -19 recovery is defined as no 
signs/symptoms of COVID -19, at least 1  negative real-time reverse tra nscription 
polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR ) test result, and nearly or completely resolved 
chest CT findings.  
Table  17.11: COVID -19 Dose Modification Criteria  
COVID -19 Worst  Toxicity NCI -CTCAE 
Version 5.0 Grade (unless otherwise specified)  Schedule Modification for U3-1402  
Grade 1  Resume study drug at the same dosea 
Grade 2  Resume study drug at the  same dose if chest CT 
findings are completely resolveda 
Reduce  by 1 dose level if chest CT findings are 
nearly resolved  
Grade 3  Reduce  by 1 dose level if chest CT findings are 
completely resolved  
Discontinue study drug if chest CT findings are 
not comple tely resolved  
Grade 4  Discontinue study drug  
COVID -19 = coronavirus 2019; CT = computed tomography  
a Closely monitor signs/symptoms after resuming U3-1402 , initially with a phone call every 3 days for the first 
week, and then with a weekly phone call thereafter, for a total of 6 weeks.  
In addition  to the recommendations outlined in Table  17.11, Investigators may consider dose 
modifications  of the study drug according to the subject’s condition and after discussion with the 
study  Medical Monitor or designee.

ILD/pneu monitis management guideline  (Table  5.2). 
Prior  and Concomitant Medications  - Prohibited Therapies/Products  
 Chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine;  
 Concomitant treatment is not allowed during the study treatment.  
 If treatment is absolutely  required for COVID -19, U3-1402  must be  interrupted.  
 If administered, then a washout period of more  than 14 days is required before 
resumption of  U3-1402 . 
PK Assessment(s)  if Chloroquine or Hydroxychloroquine is Administered  
Additional PK serum samples should be collected  from each subject who provides consent , if 
chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine is administered for COVID -19 infection, at the time points  
speci fied in  the Schedule of Events ( Appendix  17.8 ). 
The chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine administration time and the exact time of blood sample 
collection for PK analysis  must be recorded on the eCRF.  
COVID -19 Assessment(s)  
All confirmed or suspected COVID -19 infection events must be recorded in the eCRF.  If a 
subject presents to the clinic with symptoms suggestive of COVID -19, but the real -time R T-PCR 
test is not available at the site, the participant must not have any signs or symptoms of 
COVID -19 infection for at least 2 weeks and nearly or completely resolved chest CT findings.   
Serum samples will be used for COVID -19 testing from each subject  who provides 
consent.   Samples will be collected prior to the study drug infusion, at the time points specified 
in the Schedule of Events ( Section  17.8), shipped to a central laboratory, and stored there until 
the tests become available.  
If subjects consent, the remaining serum samples will also be stored  for future analysis.  
Sample collection, preparation, handling, storage, and shipping instruction s are provided in the 
Study Laboratory Manual.  
Statistical Analysis  - Assessment of the Impact of COVID -19 
If deemed appropriate, analyses will be performed to explore the impact of COVID -19 on the 
safety, efficacy, and any other endpoints, as appropriate , reported for the study.  
As a result of the impact of COVID -19 on study conduct, adjustments to the statistical analysis 
and interpretation will be made, if required.  These will be described in the statistical analysis 
plan.

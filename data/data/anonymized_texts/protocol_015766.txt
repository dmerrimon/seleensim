2.INTRODUCTION
This SAP provides the detailed methodology  for summary and statistical analy ses of the data 
collected in study  B7471003.  This document may modify  the plans outlined in the protocol; 
however, an y major modifications of the primary endpoint definition or it s anal ysis will also 
be reflected in a protocol amendment.
PF-06482077, 20- valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (20vPnC), is being developed for 
active immunization to prevent disease caused b y the Streptococcus pneumoniae serot ypes in 
the vaccine.
Pfizer is developing a new 20vPnC candidate to expand protection against pneumococcal 
disease bey ond that covered b y current pneumococcal vaccines in children and adults .  
20vPnC has the same composition as 
Prevnar 13 (13vPnC ), but contains an additional 
7 pneumococcal conjugates to protect against serotypes responsible for a substantial burden 
of remaining pneumococcal disease. A meta -analy sis of seroty pes causing invasive 
pneumococcal disease (IPD) in children <5 years of age in regions of the world that 
have 
introduced higher -valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (such as 13vPnC) showed that, 
overall, these 7 serot ypes accounted for approximately 70% of disease not due to the 13vPnC 
vaccine t ypes.  20vPnC uses the same platform as Prevnar and 13vPnC and contains 
components that have undergone extensive clinical research.  A Phase 1 study  has been 
conducted with 20vPnC in healthy  adults 18 to 49 y ears of age, and the safety  and 
immunogenicity  results support further development of 20vPnC in older adults an d infants.
The purpose of this Phase 2 study  is to describe the safet y and immunogenicity  of 20vPnC in 
infants administered vaccine (20vPnC or 13vPnC control) at 2, 4, 6, and 12 months of age.  
Safety  and immunogenicity  data from this study  will inform fur ther clinical development of 
20vPnC in pediatric populations.

Page 62.1. Study Objectives
2.1.1. Primary Objective
•To describe the safety profile of 20vPnC in healthy infants.
2.1.2. Secondary Objective
•To describe the immunogenicity of 20vPnC in healthy infants.
2.2. Study Design
This is a Phase 2, multicenter, randomized, active-controlled, double-blind study with a 
2-arm parallel design, conducted at investigator sites in the United States.  
Approximately 460 infants ≥42 to ≤98 days of age at the time of consent (signed by the 
legally acceptable representative [LAR] for the participant) will be enrolled and randomized 
in a 1:1 ratio to receive either 20vPnC or 13vPnC (as the active control vaccine).  At 2, 4, 6, and 12 months of age (Doses 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively), subjects will receive 20vPnC or 13vPnC (investigational products).  The investigational products will have the sameappearance in this study.  Blood will be drawn for immunogenicity assessments 1 month after Dose 3 (7 months of age), prior to receipt of Dose 4 (12 months of age), and 1 month after Dose 4 (13 months of age).  Subjects will be observed for 30 minutes after vaccination with 20vPnC or 13vPnC and other concomitantly administered vaccines.  Prompted local reactions (pain, redness, and swelling at the injection site), systemic events (fever, decreased appetite, drowsiness/increased sleep, and irritability), and use of antipyretic/pain medicationsoccurring within 7 days after vaccination will be collected each day in the electronic diary (e-diary; device or application). SAEs and NDCMCs will be collected for the entire duration of the study.  Adverse Events (AEs, including nonserious AEs, SAEs, and newly diagnosed chronic medical conditions (NDCMCs)) will be collected from the signing of the informed consent document to 1 month after Dose 3 and from Dose 4 to 1 month after Dose 4.  Approximately 6 months after Dose 4, the sites will contact the subject’s legally acceptable representative via telephone to inquire about SAEs and NDCMCs.

Note: If the size of the redness and/or swelling falls between 2 measuring device units, the higher measuring 
device unit number will be recorded in the e-diary.
Note: Grade 4 assessment should be made by the investigator. Grade 4 will not be collected in the e-diary but as
an AE on the CRF.
For each local reaction, the maximum severity grade will be derived for the e-diary collection 
period (Day 1 to Day 7, where Day 1 is the day of each vaccination) as follows:
= missing and =0, = highest grade (maximum severity) within 7 days of each vaccination (Day 1 to Day 7) 
among severity grades where the answers are neither “no” nor missing for at least 1 day during Days 1 to 7.

5. GENERAL METHODOLOGY AND CONVENTIONS
5.1. Hypotheses
No hypothesis testing will be performed, and also no formal statistical decision rules apply in 
this study. A descriptive estimation approach will be used to assess all safety and immunogenicity objectives. Nominal 95% confidence intervals will be calculated for all proposed endpoints.
5.2. General Methods
Time points for local reactions and systemic events refer to data within 7 days of each dose.  
5.2.1. Analyses for Binary Data
Descriptive statistics for categorical variables (eg, proportions) are the percentage (%) and 
the numerator (n), the denominator (N) used in the percentage calculation, with 95% CIs.CCI
Protocol B7471003 (PF-06482077) Statistical Analysis Plan
PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL
Page 20The exact 95% confidence interval (CI) for binary endpoints will be computed using the 
F distribution (Clopper-Pearson1).  If r is the number of responses and nis the number of 
subjects, then it follows that p = r / n is the estimate of the proportion of response.  An exact 
95% CI can be computed by solving the following 2 equations.  For the lower limitLp,

set equal to 1.0 soLpequals 0.  When r equals n, LFshould be set equal to 1.0 soUpequals 
1.0.
5.2.2. Analyses for Continuous Data
Unless otherwise stated, descriptive statistics for continuous variables are n, mean, median, 
standard deviation, minimum, and maximum.  
5.2.2.1. Geometric Mean (GM)
Geometric means will be computed along with associated 95% CIs. The GM will be 
calculated as the mean of the assay results after making the logarithm transformation and then back transformation to its original scale.  Two-sided 95% CIs will be obtained by taking log transforms of concentrations, calculating the 95% CI with reference to the t-distribution, then exponentiating the confidence limits.

Page 215.3. Methods to Manage Missing Data
For the analysis of safety endpoints, the sponsor data standard rules for imputation will be 
applied (eg, partial dates for AEs will be imputed according to Pfizer standard algorithms).
Methods for handling missing local reactions and systemic events are described in
Section 3.1 .  
Methods for handling IgG concentrations  below the limit of quantitation are 
described in Section 3.2 . All immunogenicity analyses will

6.5.1. Study Conduct and Subject Disposition
6.5.1.1. Subject Disposition
Disposition of subjects relative to Dose 1 to Dose 3 will be summarized for all subjects as 
follows:  The number of consented subjects and the number and percentage of randomized subjects who are randomized, receive each vaccination (Dose 1, Dose 2, Dose 3), complete Dose 1 to Dose 3, withdraw during Dose 1 to Dose 3 and the specific reasons (LAR request, lost to follow-up, failed to return, adverse event, protocol violation, other) will be summarized by vaccine group (according to randomized group assignment).  A similar summarization of disposition relative to Dose 4 will also be prepared, including the number and percentage of randomized subjects who completed through 1 month after Dose 3,CCI

The number of consented subjects and the number and percentage of randomized subjects 
who are randomized, vaccinated, completed, and withdrawn through 1 month after Dose 4will be presented for each vaccine group (according to randomized group assignment) and overall. 
The above information will also summarized for the time period from 1 month after Dose 4 
through 6 months after Dose 4.
 
6.5.1.2. Demographic Characteristics
Demographic characteristics will be summarized for all subjects, as well as for the Dose 4 
safety populations, and separately for the Dose 3 and Dose 4 evaluable immunogenicity populations by vaccine group and overall.
6.5.1.3. Medical History
Each reported medical history term will be mapped to a system organ class and preferred 
term according to MedDRA.  The number and percentage of subjects with an assigned vaccine having at least one diagnosis, overall and at each system organ class and preferred term level, will be summarized by vaccine group and overall for the overall safety population.
6.5.1.4. Physical Examination
Significant physical examination findings will be recorded on Medical History or AE pages, 
as relevant, and reporting done under those endpoints for the overall safety population.

The number and percentage of subjects randomized and receiving each vaccine (20vPnC or 
13vPnC) within the protocol-specified time frame, as well as before and after the specified time frame, will be tabulated for each vaccine group and overall for all randomized subjects. The denominator for the percentages is the total number of subjects in the given vaccine group or overall. In addition, the relation of randomized vaccine to actual vaccine received will be presented as a cross tabulation of the actual vaccine received versus the randomized vaccine.
6.5.3. Prior/Concomitant Vaccination and Concomitant Medications Used to Treat 
SAEs and NDCMCs
Each prior/concomitant vaccine will be summarized according to the Anatomic Therapeutic 
Chemical (ATC) 4
thlevel classification.  The number and percentage of randomized subjects 
receiving each vaccine (including DTaP-IPV-HebB (Pediarix, supplied to study sites, containing diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis, inactivated poliovirus, and hepatitis B antigens), rotavirus, Hib, MMR, varicella, influenza, others) will be cross tabulatedaccording to assigned vaccine regimen.  Summarization will be done separately for before Dose 1, between Dose 1 and 1 month after Dose 3, between 1 month after Dose 3 and Dose 4, and between Dose 4 and 1 month after Dose 4. The Dose 1 to Dose 3 safety population will be used for first three tables while the Dose 4 safety population will be used for the last one.
Concomitant medications used to treat SAEs and NDCMCs will be summarized for the time 
points Dose 1 to 6 months after Dose 4 (safety population), and for the separate time pointsDose 1 through 1 month after Dose 3 (Dose 1 to Dose 3 safety population), from 1 month after Dose 3 to Dose 4 (Dose 1 to Dose 3 safety population), Dose 4 to 1 month after Dose 4(Dose 4 safety population), and from 1 month after Dose 4 to 6 months after Dose 4 (After Dose 4 safety population).

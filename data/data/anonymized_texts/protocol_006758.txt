3.INTRODUCTION
This SAP has been developed after review of the Clinical Study  Protocol  (final  version dated 27 
April 2017) .
This SAP describes the planned analys is of the safety , tolerabili ty and pharmacokinet ic(PK)data 
from this study . A detailed descript ion of the planned TFLs to be presented in the clinical study  
report (CSR) is provided in the acco mpanying TFL shell document.
The intent of this document is to provide guidance for the statist ical and PK analyses of data. In 
general, the analyses are based on informat ion from the protocol, unless th ey have been m odified 
by agreement between Eli Lilly and Co mpany and Covance Early  Clinical (EC) Biometrics .A 
limited amount of informat ion concerning this study (e.g., objectives, study  design) is given to 
help the reader’s interpretation. This SAP m ust be si gned off prior to first subject administration
for this study .When the SAP and TFL shells are agreed upon and finalized, they will serve as 
the tem plate for thi s study’s CSR.
This SAP supersedes the stati stical considerat ions ident ified in the protocol; where 
considerations are substant ially different, they  will be so i dentified. If addit ional analyses are 
requi red to suppl ement the pl anned analyses described in this SAP, they  may be performed and 
will be ident ified in the CSR. Any substantial de viations fro m this SAP will be agreed upon 
between Eli Lilly and Company  and Covance ECBiometricsand i dentified in the CSR. Any 
minor deviat ions from the TFLs may not be documented in the CSR.
This SAP is written with consideration of the recommendat ions outlined in the Inte rnational 
Council on Harm onisation (ICH) E9 Gui deline enti tled Gui dance for Industry : Stati stical 
Principles for Clinical Trials1and the ICH E3 Guideline ent itled Guidance for Industry : Structure 
and Content of Clinical Study  Reports2.

4.3 Exploratory objective
To determine the PK of the metabo lites M8, M7, and M18 in healt hy elderly and y oung 
subjects fo llowing a single 200 mg oral dose of lasmiditan.
5.STUDY DESIGN
This is a single dose study  to determine the PK of lasmiditan fo llowing a single 200 m g oral  dose 
in healthy elderly  and young subjects. Two groups of subjects will be evaluated as fo llows:
Group 1 (healt hy elderly subjects; ≥65 years): 200 mg lasmiditan and placebo in a 
rando mized, double -blind, 2 -period crossover design .
Group 2 (healt hy young subjects; 18 to 45 y ears, inclusive): 200 mg lasmiditan in an 
open l abel design .
Subjects in Group 2 will be matched by primary  race, sex, and body  mass index ( BMI )(±20%) 
to subjects in Group 1 where feasible. Both groups may  be studi ed concurrently. 
Screening Period:
All subjects will part icipate in a screening visit up to 28 days prior to study  drug dosing.
Dosing Period:
Subjects in Group 1 will part icipate in 2 dosing periods. They will be admitted to the clinical 
research unit (CRU )on the day  prior to dosing (Day  -1), and receive study  drug on Day  1 for 
each dosing period. Subjects may  be discharged from  the CRU on Day  3 based on invest igator 
discreti on. There will be a washout period of 3 to 10 day s between e ach dose. Subj ects m ay stay  
in the CRU as inpat ient during the entire dosing period.
Subjects in Group 2 will part icipate in 1 dosing period. They  will be admi tted to the CRU on 
Day -1 and receive study  drug on Day  1. Subjects may be discharged from the CR U on Day  3 
based on invest igator discretion.
All subjects will be discharged from the study  approximately  7 days post thei r final  dose of
lasmiditan.

7.SAMPLE SIZE JUSTIFICATION
Up to 36 subjects may be enro lled in order that 30 subjects (2 groups of 15) complete the study. 
For area under the curve ( AUC )or maximum observed drug concentration (Cmax), assuming 
inter-subject coefficient of variation ( CV)of 40% and a sample size of 15 per group, the 90% 
confidence interval around the ratio of the geometric means (elderly group : non -elderly group) 
will have half -width of  24.3% on the l og scal e with 90% coverage probabilit y.
8.DEFINITION OF ANALYSIS POPULATI ONS
The “Safet y” populat ion will consist of all subjects who received at least one dose of study drug 
or placebo , and have at least one postdose safet y assessment.
The “Pharmacokinet ic” popul ation will consist of a ll subjects who received at least one dose of 
study  drug and have evaluable PKdata.  Subjects may be excluded from the PK summary 
statist ics and statist ical analysis if a subject has an adverse event of vo miting that occurs at or 
before 2 times median time of maximum observed drug concentration (tmax). 
All protocol deviat ions that occur during the study will be considered for their severit y/impact 
and will be taken into considerat ion when subjects are assigned to analysis popul ations.
9.STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY
9.1 General
Data list ings will be provided for all data that is databased. Summary statist ics and statist ical 
analysis will only  be presented for data where detailed in this SAP. For continuous data, 
summary statist ics will include the arithmet ic mean, arithmetic standard deviat ion (SD), m edian,
min, max and N; for log -normal data (e.g. the PK parameters: AUCs and C max) the geometric 
mean and geo metric CV %will also be presented. For categorical data, frequency count and 
percentages will be presented. Data list ings will be provided for all subj ects up to the point of 
withdrawal , with any subjects excluded from the relevant populat ion highlighted. Summary  
statist ics and statist ical analyses will generally only be performed for subjects included in the 
relevant analysis populat ion.For the calcul ation of summary statist ics and statist ical analysis, 
unrounded data will be used. 
Mean change fro m baseline is the mean of all individual subjects’ change fro m baseline values. 
Each individual change fro m baseline will be calculated by  subtracting the i ndividual subject’s 
baseline value from the value at the timepo int. The individual subject’s change from baseline 
values will be used to calculate the mean change from baseline using a SAS procedure such as 
Proc Univariate.

Data analysis will be performed using SAS®Version 9.3or greater.
9.2 Demographics and Subject Disposition
Subject disposi tion will be listed . 
The demographic variab les age, sex , race, ethnicit y,country  of 
enrolment, site ID ,body weight, height and body  mass index will be summar ized and listed .
9.3 Pharmacokinetic Assessment
9.3.1 Pharmacokinetic Analysis
Plasma concentrati ons of lasmiditan (LY573144) and its metabo lites M8, M7 and M18 will be 
used to determine the fo llowing PK parameters, when possible:  
Parameter Units Definition
AUC (0-) ng.h/mL area under the concentration versus time curve from zero to 
infinity
AUC (0-tlast) ng.h/mL area under the concentration versus time curve from time zero to 
time t, where t is the last time point with a measurable 
concentration
%AUC (tlast-) % percentage of AUC (0-∞)extrapolated
Cmaxng/mL maximum observed drug concentration
tmaxh time of maximum observed drug concentration
t½h half-life associated with the terminal rate constant (λ z) in 
non-compartmental analysis
CL/F L/h apparent total body clearance of drug calculated after 
extra -vascular administration ( LY573144 only)
Vz/F L apparent volume of distribution during the terminal phase after 
extra -vascular administration ( LY573144 only)
Vss/F L apparent volume of distribution at steady s tate after extra -vascular 
administration ( LY573144 only)
MR metabolic ratioa
a= no molar correction will be applied since the metabolites are very  similar in molecular weight  and within 5% of 
the molecular weight for lasmiditan .
Addit ional PK parameters may be calculated, as appropriate.  The software and versio n used for 
the final analyses will be specified in the clinical  study report. Any except ions or special 
handling of data will be clearly documented within the final study  report.
Formatting of tables, figures and abbreviat ions will follow the Eli Lilly Global PK/PD/TS Tool : 
NON- COMPARTMENTAL PHARMACOKINETIC STYLE GUIDE. The versi on of the tool
effect ive at the time of PK analysis will be fo llowed.

General PK Parameter Rules
Actual  sampling times will be used in the final analyses of individual PK parameters, 
except for non -bolus pre -dose sampling times which will be set to zero . For non -bolus, 
multiple dose profiles, the pre -dose time will be set to zero unless a time deviat ion falls 
outsi de of  the protocol blood collect ion time window which is considered to impact PK 
param eter derivat ion.
Cmaxand t maxwill be reported from observed values.  If C maxoccurs at m ore than one time 
point, t maxwill be assigned to the first occurrence of C max. 
AUC parameters will be calculated using a combination of the linear and logarithmic 
trapezoi dal methods (linear -log trapezoi dal rule).  The linear trapezoidal method will be 
applied up to t maxand then the logarithmic trapezoidal meth od will be used after t max. The 
minimum requirement for the calculat ion of AUC will be the inclusio n of at least three 
consecut ive plasma concentrations above the lower limit of quant ificat ion (LLOQ), with 
at least one of these concentrations fo llowing C max. AUC (0-)values where the percentage 
of the total  area extrapol ated is m ore than 20% will be flagged. Any AUC(0- ) value 
excluded fro m summary  stati stics will be noted in the footnote of the summary table.
Half-life (t ½) will be calculated, when appropri ate, based on the apparent terminal 
log-linear portion of the concentration- time curve. The start of the terminal eliminat ion 
phase for each subject will be defined by  visual  inspecti on and generally will be the first 
point at which there is no sy stematic deviat ion from the log -linear decline in plasma 
concentrations.  Half -life will only  be calculated when a reliable est imate for this 
param eter can be obtained comprising o f at least 3 data points.  If t ½is est imated over a 
time window of less than 2half-lives, the values will be flagged in the data list ings. Any 
t½ value excluded fro m summary  stati stics will be documented in the footnote of the 
summary table. 
A uniform weight ing scheme will be used in the regressi on analysis of the terminal 
log-linear portion of the concentration -time curve.
The parameters based on observed concentration at last quantifiable timepo int (Clast)will 
be reported .
Individual PK Parameter Rules
Only quantifiable concentrations will be used to calculate PK parameters wi th the 
exception of special handling of certain concentratio ns reported below the lower limit of 
quant itation (BQL).  Pl asma concentrations reported as BQL will be set to a value of zero 
when all o f the following condit ions are met: 
oThe compound is non -endogenous.
oThe samples are from the init ial dose peri od for a subject or from a subsequent 
dose peri od following a sui table wash -out peri od.
oThe time points occur before the first quant ifiable concentration.
All other BQL concentrations that do not meet the above criteria will be set to missing.

Covance Clinical Study  No. 8364953 Sponsor Reference H8H -MC-LAHA
Also, where two or more consecut ive concentrations are BQL towards the end of a 
profile, the profile will be deemed to have terminated and therefore any further 
quant ifiable concentrations will be set to missing for the calculat ion of the PK parameters 
unless it i s considered to be a true characteristic of the profile of the drug.
Individual Concentration vs. Time Profiles
Individual concentrations will be plotted utilizing actual sampling times.
The terminal po int selections will be indicated on a semi -logarithmic pl ot.
Average Concentration vs. Time Profiles
The average concentration profiles will be graphed using scheduled (no minal) sampling 
times. 
The average concentration profiles will be graphed using arithmet ic average 
concentrations.
The pre -dose average concentration for single -dose data from  non-endogenous 
compounds will  be set to zero.  Otherwise, only quant ifiable concentrations will be used 
to cal culate average concentrations.
Concentrations at a sampling time exceeding the sampling time window specified in the 
protocol , or ±10%, will be excluded from the average concentration profiles.
Concentrations excluded from the mean calculation will be documented in the final study  
report.
A concentration average will be plotted for a given sampling time only  if 2/3 of  the 
individual data at the time point have quant ifiable measurements that are within the 
sampling t ime window specified in the protocol or ± 10%. An average concentration 
estimated wi th less than 2/3 but more than 3 data points may be displayed on the mean 
concentration plot if determined to be appropriate and will be documented within the 
final study  report.
Treatment of Outliers during Pharmacokinetic Analysis
Applicat ion of this procedure to all pharmacokineti c analyses is not a requirement. Rather, this 
procedure provides justificat ion for exclusio n of data when scientifically appropriate. This 
procedure describes the methodol ogy for ident ifying an individual value as an outlier for 
potenti al exclusi on, but does not requi re that the val ue be excluded from  analysis.  The foll owing 
methodol ogy will not be used to exclude complete profiles from analysis.
Data Within an Individual Profile
A value within an individual profile may be excluded from analysis if any of the following 
criteria are met:
For pharm acokinet ic profiles during mult iple dosing, the concentration of the pre -dose 
sample exceeds all measured concentrations for that individual in the subsequent post -
dose sam ples.
Final , 03July2017              Page 11of 14Statistical Analysi s Plan CONFIDENTIAL
Covance Clinical Study  No. 8364953 Sponsor Reference H8H -MC-LAHA
For pharm acokinet ic profiles during single dosing of non -endogenous compounds, the 
concentration in a pre -dose sam ple is quant ifiable.
For any  quest ionable datum  that does not satisfy  the above cri teria, the profile will be 
evaluated and results reported wi th and wi thout the suspected datum. 
Data Between Individual Profiles
1.If n<6, then the dataset is too small to conduct a reliable range test.  Data will be 
analyzed with and without the aty pical value, and both sets of results will be reported.  
2.If n6,then an object ive outlier test will be used to compare the aty pical  value to other 
values included in that calculat ion:
a.Transform all values in the calculation to the logarit hmic domain.
b.Find the most extrem e value from  the ari thmetic mean o f the log tran sformed 
values and exclude that value from the dataset.
c.Calculate the lower and upper bounds of the range defined by the arithmet ic 
mean ±3*SD of the remaining log -transformed values.
d.If the extreme value is within the range of arit hmetic mean ±3*SD, then it is 
not an outlier and will be retained in the dataset.
e.If the extreme value is outside the range of arithmetic mean ±3*SD, then it is 
an outlier and will be excluded from analysis.
If the remaining dataset contains another atypical datum  suspected to bean outlier and n ≥ 6 
following the exclusi on, then repeat step 2 above. This evaluat ion may be repeated as many 
times as necessary, excluding only one suspected outlier in each iteration, until all data 
remaining in the dataset fall within the range of arithmet ic mean ±3*SD of the log-transformed 
values.
Reporting of Excluded Values
Individual values excluded as outliers will be docum ented in the final report.  Approval of the 
final report will connote approval of the exclusio n.
9.3.2 Pharmacokinetic Statistical Methodology
The PK parameter estimates will be evaluated to determine the impact of age on the PK of 
lasmiditan and its metabo lites. Log -transformed C maxand AUC (0-∞)will be eval uated in a linear 
fixed -effects m odel with a fixed effect of age group (elderly, young) . The 90% confidence 
intervals (CIs) of the ratios of geometric means o f the elderly group versus the y oung group will 
be presented. An example of the SAS code that will be used is as fo llows:
proc mixed data=xxx;
class agegroup;
modell_pk = agegroup / alpha=0.1 ;
lsmeans agegroup / pdiff;
run;
where l_pk is the log -transformed (base e) PKparameter.

Covance Clinical Study  No. 8364953 Sponsor Reference H8H -MC-LAHA
The t maxwill be analyzed using a Wilcoxon rank sum test. Estimates of the median difference 
between elderly  and young subjects based on the observed medians, 90% CIs and the p- value 
from the Wilcoxon test will be calculated.
Addit ional analysis will be performed if warranted upon review of the data.
9.4 Safety and Tolerability Assessments
9.4.1 Adverse events
Where changes in severit y are recorde d in the Case Report Form ( CRF), each separate severit y 
of the adverse event (AE) will be reported in the listings , only  the m ost severe will be used in the 
summary tables . A pre -exist ing condit ion is defined as an AE that starts before the subject has 
provided wri tten informed consent and is ongo ing at consent . A non -treatm ent emergent AE is 
defined as an AE which starts after informed consent but prior to dosing. A treatment -emergent 
AE is defined as an AE which occurs postdose or which is present prio r to dosing and beco mes 
more severe postdose. 
All AEs will be listed .  Treatm ent-emergent AEs will be summariz ed by  age group, treatm ent, 
severit y and rel ationship to the study  drug. The frequency (the number of adverse events, the 
number of subjects experiencing an adverse event and the percentage of subjects experiencing an 
adverse event) of treatment -emergent adverse events will be summariz ed by  age group, 
treatm ent, Medical Dict ionary for Regulatory  Activities (MedDRA )versio n 20.0 system  organ 
class and preferred term. The summary and frequency adverse event tables will be presented for 
all causalit ies and those considered related to the study  drug .Any serious adverse events will be 
tabul ated.
9.4.2 Concomitant medication
Concomitant medicat ion will be coded using the WHO drug dict ionary (Versi on September 2016 
Enhanced Dict ionary B2 Form at).Concomitant medicat ion will be listed.
9.4.3 Clinical laboratory parameters
Allclinical chemistry , hematol ogyand urinalysis data will belisted .Addit ionally clinical 
chemistry , hematol ogyand urinalysis data outside the r eference ranges will be listed.
Values f or any  clinical chemistry , hematol ogy and urinalysis values outside the reference ranges 
will be flagged on the individual subject data list ings.
9.4.4 Hepatic Monitoring
If a subject experiences elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≥ 3 × upper limit of normal 
(ULN), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) ≥ 2 × ULN, or elevated total bilirubin (TBL) ≥ 2 × ULN, 
liver tests will be performed to confirm the abnormalit y.  
The subjects’ liver disease history  and associ ated person liver disease history  data will be listed.  
Any conco mitant m edicati on of  acetaminophen/paracetamol will be listed.  Results from a ny

hepat ic monitoring procedures, such as a magnetic resonance elas tography  (MRE) scan and a 
biopsy assessment will be listed, if performed.
Hepati c risk factor assessment data will be listed.  Liver related signs and symptoms data will be 
summarized by  age group and treatm ent, and listed, if available. 
All hepat ic chemi stry, hematol ogy, coagul ation, and serology  data will be summarized by  
param eter, age group, and treatment, and listed.  Values outside the reference ranges will be 
flagged on the individual subject data list ings.
9.4.5 Vital signs
Where supine (or semi -recumben t for elderly  subjects) blood pressure and pulse rate are 
measured in triplicate, the mean value will be calculated and used in all subsequent calculat ions. 
When triplicate blood pressure or pulse rate measurements precede a standing measurement, the 
last supine (or semi -recumbent for elderly  subjects) blood pressure or pulse rate measurement 
will be used for orth ostati c calculat ions. Orthostatic changes will be calculated as the standing 
value, minus the last supine (or semi -recumbent for elderly  subjects) value taken prior to the 
standing value.
Vital signs data will be summarized by age group and treatment together with changes from 
baseline, where baseline is defined as the mean of the tri plicate m easurement on Day 1 predose 
of each treatm ent peri od for supine (or semi -recumbent for elderly subjects) vital signs ,and the 
last m easurement on Day  1 predose of each treatment period for standing and orthostatic vital 
signs. Figures of mean vital signs and mean changes from baseline profiles by treatment will be 
presented by age group and treatm entover time . Furthermore, values for individual subjects will 
be listed.
Changes fro m baseline will be calculated for vitals signs. Changes fro m baseline o f >30mmHg 
for systol ic blood pressure and of >20 mmHg for diastolic blood pressure are considered to be of 
potenti al clinical  concern and will be highlighted on the individual changes from baseline data 
listings. Orthostati c decreases of >20 mmHg for systolic and diastolic bl ood pressure or an 
increase in heart rate of >20 bpm are considered to be of potential clinical concern, and will also 
be highlighted on the individual data list ings. 
9.4.6 Electrocardiogram (ECG)
For each subject, ECGs will be performed for safety purposes only, and will not be reported.
9.4.7 Other assessments
All other safet y assessments not detailed in this section will be listed but not sum marized or

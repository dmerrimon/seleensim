(Protocol TC-UT-03, Version 6.0) 
whatever time you need to discuss the study with your physician and family.  The decision to 
participate or not to participate is yours.  If you decide to participate, please sign and date wher e 
indicated at the end of this form.   
 
The research study is being sponsored by UroGen. Uro Gen is called the Sponsor and 
[Site/ Institut ion Name ] is being paid by UroGen to conduct this study. [PI Name ] is the primary 
investigator.  
 
The study will take place at [Site/ Institut ion Name ].  
 
WHY IS THE STUDY BEING DONE?  
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of MitoGel on patients with 
UTUC. This research study is being done because this is a potentially beneficial new treatment 
for Low Grade UTUC.  
 
Mitomycin C (MMC) is FDA approved for other clinical indications and commercially available 
for the treatment of bladder cancer. UroGen’s MitoGel™ (a combination of MMC and TC -3 gel) 
has not been approved by the FDA and is not commercially available. The gel is designed to 
safely maintain the MMC within the body to treat the urinary tract urothelial carc inoma .  
 
HOW MANY PEOPLE WILL TAKE PART IN THE STUDY?  
Participants in the study are referred to as subjects. About 74 subjects will take part in this study 
worldwide; about [Number  of Subjects]  subjects will be recruited at this site.  
 
WHAT IS INVOLVED IN THE STUDY?  
If you take part in this study, you will have the following tests and procedures:  
 
You will receive  6 MitoGel instillations  (treatments  with the MitoGel ) into upper urinary tract 
(specific area in the kidney) once  per week for 6 weeks.  MitoGel for the treatment of upper tract 
urothelial carcinoma (UTUC) contains the drug Mitomycin C. The administration of MitoGel 
will be performed under fluoroscopy  (medi cal imaging that shows a continuous x -ray image on a 
monitor)  and cystoscopy (procedure to examine the lining of your bladder and the tube that 
carries urine out of your body) through a standard ureteral catheter. Your physician will review 
the details of the instillation procedure, which are similar to a cystoscopy.  
 
 
Entering this study will delay any other method of care for your situation by at least 3 months.  
 
Such delay is considered low risk in patient with low grade upper  tract urothelial carcinom a. 
 
If the treatment succeeds, meaning, the tumor(s) disappeared after 6 instillations (Complete 
Response=CR), you will receive up to an additional 11 (eleven) maintenance instillations.  
 
This is a multi -center open label, single arm, safety and efficacy study.

respectively will not contain your personal identification information (de -identified).  
 
SCREENING FOR ELIGIBILITY  
 
18November 2018   Patient Consent Form, Version 7.0 Page 4 of 19 
(Protocol TC-UT-03, Version 6.0) 
If you agree to participate in this study, the following may happen for participation up to 28 days 
before starting experimental treatment:  
 
• You must first consent to participate in this study  
• You will undergo a detailed evaluation.  This will include a collection of your medical 
history information, a physical examination , including a measurement of your vital signs,  
fulfillment  of eligibility criteria, and a review of your current and past medica tions .  
• We will be collecting a urine sample for urinalysis and urine culture, which are all 
standard urine tests.  
• We will collect 20 ccs of blood  (4 teaspoons)  for routine testing, including kidney, liver, 
blood count, and coagulation tests.  
• If you are a woman of child bearing potential, 5ccs  (1 teaspoon)  blood will be drawn for a 
pregnancy test.   
 
Prior to Instillation  (during the screening period) :  
We will conduc t a pyelography, which is an examination to assess the upper urinary tract, to 
determine the volume of MitoGel to be instilled  in each visit . (Details below)  
 
During this examination, we will also conduct the following procedures, i f they  
a) Have  not already been completed for your care within the past two (2) months , and  
b) Records  and slides are available for the study sponsor for review  
c) Or if it is not informative enough for the study requirement:   
 
• A biopsy of lesions within the upper tract  
• Upper tract urine cytology (a washing cytology)  
• A video recording or photography of the diagnostic ureteroscopy &  upper urinary tract 
lesion assessment . (Under anesthesia)  
 
The volume of your kidney will be measured with a contrast agent  (This is a commonly used 
substance that enhances the ability to see the specific parts inside the body during medical 
imaging),  during the Ureteroscopy or duri ng the first treatment through the ureter catheter. This 
measured volume will be the volume of the MitoGel you will receive each treatment . 
 
If you have not had a recent CT U (CT urography)  scan within the past – Three (3)  months  or if 
your doctor believe s it is necessary to a better evaluation of your current disease , you will be 
required to repeat CTU scan.  In the event that CTU cannot be performed due to any reason, an 
MRI should be performed instead.  
 
Medication:  
In order to facilitate the instillations, you will be prescribed with 1.3 g Sodium bicarbonate 
tablets (a type of salt), to help lower the acidity levels in your urine, as acidic urine can cause the 
fast breakdown of the Mitomycin C. These tablets are to b e taken the night before each 
instillation, the morning of instillation, and again 30 minutes prior to each instillation procedure.  
 
 
18November 2018   Patient Consent Form, Version 7.0 Page 5 of 19 
(Protocol TC-UT-03, Version 6.0) 
In order to avoid allergic symptoms , you may be prescribed  with prophylactic anti -allergic 
treatment –Anti-histaminic agents. These tablets are to be taken the day before instillation, on the 
day of instillation and the day after the instillation.  
 
It is preferred that diuretics not be taken the night before and prior  to the instillation. If you are 
on diuretic medications, your doctor will determine whether the medication can be skipped prior 
to the instillations.  
 
To the extent that it is possible, drinking should be avoided in the 4 -6 hours prior to the 
instillation .  
• Post instillation drinking should be limited. A recommended drinking schedule follows:  
• 0-2 hours post instillation: refrain from drinking any liquid  
• 2-4 hours post instillation: 1 cup of water every 2 hours  
• 4 hours post instillation: resume normal li quids consumption  
 
Following instillation, you will be carefully monitored for urine output and clinical symptoms, 
which might indicate urinary obstruction.  
 
Aiming to minimize the risk for Urinary Tract Infections (UTI), an antibiotic will be prescribed, 
as is normal for this kind of procedure . 
 
Your doctor might prescribe you with Diazepam, an anti -anxiety medication to be taken 1 hour 
prior to each instillat ion. 
 
You will be given separate written instructions for each of these steps, and will also receive a 
phone call from a member of the study  team to remind you.  
 
Treatments with UroGen’s MitoGel™  
You will have 6 treatments performed once weekly for 6 weeks . Each treatment will include 
MitoGel ™ will contain 4 mg of Mitomycin C per 1 mL of TC -3 gel (4:1 ratio) which will be 
administered through  an ureteral catheter into the upper urinary tract. The procedure will take 
approximately 30 minutes. After MitoGel™ administration (MitoGel  injection  will be performed 
under fluoroscopy and cystoscopy through a standard ureteral catheter  as explained above) ., the 
gel will form a reservoir in the renal pelvis, which will  dissolve over several hours, delivering the 
drug to cover the surface during that time.  
 
Upon consultation with your urologist , in very rare cases,  the catheter may be kept in place for 
the 6 weeks duration, instead of having new ones put in every week (and removed). Your care 
team will provide home care instructions.  
 
Instillation through a nephrostomy tube may be an option, if necessary.  
 
It may be required that an educational trainer from the sponsor will be present during some of the 
treatments to support the clinical team with the proper instructions of use.  
 
 
18November 2018   Patient Consent Form, Version 7.0 Page 6 of 19 
(Protocol TC-UT-03, Version 6.0) 
During the first instillation visit  
You will undergo a standard urology -oriented physical exam, including vital signs measurement, 
and we will collect information about your medications. W e will collect 20 cc of blood  (4 
teaspoons)  for routine testing, including kidney, liver, blood count, and coagulation tests.   
 
• Urine will be collected for standard urologic assessment tests, including urinalysis, and 
urine culture. If you are a woman of child bearing potential, some of the urine will be 
used for a pregnancy test (If the urine test is positive, a blood (1 teaspoon)  pregnancy test will 
be performed ).  
 
If not done during screening, the volume of your kidney will be measured with a contrast agent 
through the ureter  catheter. This measured volume will be the volume  of the MitoGel you will 
receive each treatment  
 
After the treatment you will be  provided with a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) form and 
requested to mark the degree of pain during the instillation procedure on a scale of 0 -10. You 
will also be given a  Post-Treatment  questionnaire to evaluate your post -treatment experience 
with the following questions:  
1. How long after the treatment did you have your first urination?  
2. How long after the treatment was the urine clear (no purple color) for the first time?  
 
Thereafter, 24 t o 32 hours post treatment, you will be contacted via telephone to review the 
completed questionnaire. Please keep the completed questionnaire as it will be collected at the 
next visit.  
 
Following this first visit, we will monitor you for 6 -23 hours after t he instillation for observation, 
at the investigator’s discretion, to monitor for side effects. This initial treatment will be done in 
the clinic /office  or in the operating room with anesthesia  
. 
If you allow, on the visit for the first instillation, for t his, we will collect blood samples, to 
monitor the drug distribution (Pharmacokenetic assessment).  PK will be performed with 
just 6 first patients who provide informed consent.   This will be done prior to instillation, 
thirty minutes after the instillation s, and then again  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 hours post 
instillation.  Each sample will require 5 mL of blood. Yes, I agree to the collection of 
serial blood samples during the first instillation visit.  
 
No, I do not agree to the collection of serial blood samples during the first instillation 
visit.  
 
 
Instillation  Visits 2 through 6  
Prior to  visits 2 through 6  -up to 3 days prior to treatment day , your blood (approximately 20 
mL) will be tested for safety evaluation (check your blood count, liver enzymes, kidney function, 
electrolytes and coagulation).  
 

 
18November 2018   Patient Consent Form, Version 7.0 Page 7 of 19 
(Protocol TC-UT-03, Version 6.0) 
On treatment day  the following procedures will be conducted:  
 
1. A standard urology -oriented physical examination, including a measurement of your 
vital signs, and a review of your current medications as well as any side effects.   
2. Urine will be collected for standard urologic assessment tests, including urinalysis 
and urine culture.  
3. If you are a woman of child bearing potential, a urine pregnancy test will be 
conducted.  If the urine test is positive, a blood pregnancy test will be performed.  
4. In case not all blood test were preformed prior to treatment – your blood ( up to  20 
mL) will be tested  according to missing test (blood count / liver enzymes / kidney 
function/  electrolytes / coagulation)..  
 
After each treatment , you will be requested to mark the degree of pain during the instillation 
procedure on a scale of 0 -10. Y ou will also be given a questionnaire to evaluate your post -
treatment experience  with the following  questions:  
1. How long after the treatment did you have your first urination?  
2. How long after the treatment was the urine clear (no purple color) for the first time?  
 
Thereafter, 24 to 32 hours post treatment,  you will be contacted via telephone to review the 
completed questionnaire . Please keep the completed questionnaire as it will be collected at the 
next visit.  
 
If necessary, you may be called for an unscheduled visit to follow up on any post -treatment 
issues or problems that require clinical evaluation or follow -up. 
 
You will undergo safety evaluation after each instillation including adverse event rate and 
laboratory evaluation.  
 
In the event of a urinary tract infection or another safety reason which cau ses the investigator to 
postpone a treatment, the MitoGel treatment will be postponed until the event is resolved and not 
over 4 weeks; In case treatment has been delayed beyond 4 weeks due to adverse drug reaction 
MitoGel treatment will be stopped permane ntly, however, you will continue to follow up visits.  
 
Following Installation Visits  
One week, and again three weeks following the 6th installation, your blood (up to 20 mL / 4 
teaspoons) will be tested (a CBC , liver function,  renal function and  coagulation  will be taken ).  If 
necessary, this can be done at your local clinic or doctor’s office.  
 
Primary Disease Evaluation Visit (PDE)  
 
About five weeks following the completion of treatment visits,  you will be scheduled for an 
evaluation visit.  This will involve the following procedures:  
 
1. A full physical examination, including a urology oriented physical  exam, vital signs 
measurements  and a review of your current medications as well as any side effects.  
 
18November 2018   Patient Consent Form, Version 7.0 Page 8 of 19 
(Protocol TC-UT-03, Version 6.0) 
2. Your blood will be tested to check your blood count, liver enzymes, kidney function, 
electrolytes and coagulation (4 teaspoon).  
3. Urine will be collected  for urinalysis and urine culture.  
4. You will undergo Ureteroscopy evaluation  under anesthesia to evaluate the area of 
treatment, which include an upper urinary tract cytology, and biopsy of lesions, if 
applicable.   
 
At the evaluation, if no detectable dise ase is found, you will be considered a Complete Response 
(CR) patient  and continue with the study as described below.  You will receive up to an 
additional 11 (eleven) maintenance treatments.  
  
If you responded partially or did not respond to the treatment, you will be considered as a Non-
Complete Response  and your participation in the study will be terminated .  
In the event that your cytology test results are equivocal , you will undergo re -cytology test after 
several weeks. This sentence apply also to each of the follow -up visits.   
 
Your urologist will discuss the results with you and will determine which standard of care 
treatment is best, and information about the dis ease will be collected.  
. 
Study continuation for Complete Response patients only:  
 
Maintenance Instillation Visits   
In the case that you are a complete response patient  (no detec table disease on the PDE visit) , you 
will be scheduled for monthly visits, during which MitoGel will be instilled as described in the 
visits above.  This will occur once per month (+ - 2 week) for eleven months, (one month prior to 
last FU visit within the study - see below) or until tumor  first recurrence.  
 
The following procedures will be conducted:  
• Standard  urology -oriented physical examination  
• Your  blood (approximately 20 mL) will be tested to check your blood count, liver 
enzymes, kidney function, electrolytes and coagulation and medi cation review.  
• Urine  will be collected for standard urologic assessment tests, including urinalysis and 
urine culture.   
• Review of your current medications and adverse events, if any.   
 
The tests will be conducted while you are at the clinic for your monthly treatments. If the disease 
reoccurs, you will stop treatment in the study and your urologist will review your treatment 
options.  If you decide to stop study participation, you will b e asked to perform a safety visit.   
 
Follow -up Visits  
During the time of the maintenance instillation visits, you will have  an up to a  4 standard -of-care 
follow -up visits  done  every 3 months .   
 
 
18November 2018   Patient Consent Form, Version 7.0 Page 9 of 19 
(Protocol TC-UT-03, Version 6.0) 
Three months after your evaluation visit, the first follow -up (FU) visit will be conducted. During 
this visit, follow -up data on your disease outcome will be collected. As per standard of care, you 
will undergo these follow -up visits every three months.  
 
These visits may include:  
1. A review of your current medications, vital signs and reporting of any adverse events.  
2. Endoscopy of the kidney (ureteroscopy under anesthesia) where the upper urinary 
tract will be examined and photographed to record number, size , appearance and 
location of tumors if any are present. This will also include a biopsy sample of the 
tumor, if lesions are detected. If present, the tumor(s) may be surgically ablated 
(destroyed)  
3. Upper urinary tract urine cytology will be performed to co nfirm the absence of 
cancer.  
 
The final follow up visit will happen 12 months after the post -instillation evaluation visit, or until 
tumor first recurrence, at which time, additional follow -up data on disease outcome will be 
collected.  
 
CTU Scan  
At the 4th follow up visit, we will obtain a final CT U scan.  
 
Note:  In case of  recurrence or progression  at the original treated area,  assessed during the 
follow -up period, you will be considered as having completed the trial and will not be summoned 
for further follow -up visits , but for a single termination visit for safety evaluation . 
 
FOLLOW -UP VISITS AND END OF STUDY PARTICIPATION  
 
Unscheduled Visit  
An unscheduled visit may  be performed at any time during the trial if the investigator decides 
that the clinical state of the patient does not permit instillation of the IP, for assessment of safety, 
at the Patient's request, or as deemed necessary by the investigator.  
 
You should provide  the trial urologist information about any medications you are taking.  In 
addition, if you are taking any over -the-counter drugs or herbal supplements which you have 
obtained from the drug store, grocery store, etc., this information should also be provided to the 
urologist.  
 
Withdrawal by investigator, physician, or sponsor  
The investigators may end your participation in this study for a number of reasons, such as if 
your safety and welfare are at risk, if you do not follow instructions or if you miss scheduled 
visits. The investigators or the study sponsor might also decide to stop the study at any time.  
 
The investigators, physicians or sponsors may stop the study or take you out of the study at any 
time should they judge that it is in your best interest to do so, if you experience a study -related 
injury, if you need additi onal or different medication, or if you do not comply with the study 
 
18November 2018   Patient Consent Form, Version 7.0 Page 10 of 19 
(Protocol TC-UT-03, Version 6.0) 
plan. They may remove you from the study for various other administrative and medical reasons. 
They can do this without your consent . 
 
If you decide to stop being in the study  or are removed from the study or the study is stopped the 
investigator will ask you to do a follow -up visit to complete an exit interview. The data collected 
about you up to the point of withdrawal will remain a pa rt of the study and may not be removed 
from the study database.  
 
If you decide to stop receiving the study treatment prior the 6th instillation , the investigator will 
ask you to continue being in the study up to the PDE visit. In the event that you didn’t complete  
the study treatment, but have a Complete Response to the treatment,  you will be advised to 
continue with  the follow -up visit s as long as possible even without having the study treatment , 
but in consultation with your study doctor  it may be  re-consider ed continuing with  monthly 
instillation s until 1-year follow -up or disease recurrence . The data collected about you up to the 
point of withdrawal will remain a part of the study and may not be removed from the study 
database.   
 
Note:   Your f ollow up data may be collected up to 3 years from PDE visit  (visit 9)  to evaluate 
long term safety and efficacy of the investigational product.  
 
WHAT ARE THE RISKS OF THE STUDY?  
For drug and device trials, there may be risks. These risks will be discussed with you by the 
research urologist .  
 
Each treatment may have possible adverse events. In the current treatment there might be 
Mitomycin C -related adverse events and Catheter ins ertion related adverse events . 
 
Many side effects go away shortly after treatment is stopped, but in some cases, side effects may 
be serious, long -lasting or permanent, and may even result in hospitalization.  
 
Inflammation causing narrowing in the ureters is   a common phenomenon, most of the cases 
resolve with or without intervention, for example placing a stent in the ureter. In some cases, the 
narrowing persists, or resolves  with some residual damage.  
 
 
MMC+TC -3 Side Effects  
Based upon limited information regarding upper urinary tract irrigation with MMC+TC -3 (based 
on data from 22 compassionate treatments of upper tract urothelial carcinoma  and the patients 
treated in the study so far ): 
 
The following were reported more than once  in the compassionate treatment series  as probably or 
possibly related to study drug:  
• Allergic Reaction (n=2)  
• Dysuria  (burning or painful urination)  (n=2)  
 
18November 2018   Patient Consent Form, Version 7.0 Page 11 of 19 
(Protocol TC-UT-03, Version 6.0) 
• Weakness/ Fatigue (n=4)  
• Fever/chills (n=2)  
• Aggravation of renal  failure (n=2)  
• Blood line suppression (n=2)  - decreased white blood cells (increases infection risk), red 
blood cells (increases fatigue risk), and platelets (increases bleeding and bruising risk)  
• Nausea (n=3)  
 
Catheter Insertion Related Side Effects  
Trauma to the bladder/ upper urinary tract creating:  
 
Common:  
Adverse events affecting the ureter  including, but not limited to inflammation of the ureter and 
narrowing of the ureter.  
 
Less Common  or Rare : 
• Urinary tract infections resulting from the presence of a foreign body (the catheter) in the 
urinary tract  
 
• Urethral stenosis - narrowing of the urethra (passage from which urine leaves the bladder)   
 
• Urethral tear - due to traumatic insertion of the catheter   
 
• Ureteral perforation (tearing, breakage, or holes on the ureter)  
 
 
Mechanical Manipulations related Side effects (Including catheter Insertion and nephrostomy 
tube related side effects)  
 
Catheter insertion to the upper tract is well -practiced worldwide and widely used for many 
indications for example during kidney stones removal, the following are the known side effects 
of this procedure, including those evident in the upper urinary tract instillations  (as seen in  the 
CUP described above:  
 
• Flank (between the ribs and the hip) pain (n=6)  
• Mild pressure/fullness at instillation site (n=4)  
• Acute Pyelonephritis (acute infection of the kidney)(n=3)  
• Asymptomatic Bacteriuria (n=2)  
• Macroscopic Hematuria  (visible blood in urine)(n=2)  
 
Apart from the above - any adverse event mentioned in the information leaflet of mitomycin C 
may appear during the study.  
 
 
18November 2018   Patient Consent Form, Version 7.0 Page 12 of 19 
(Protocol TC-UT-03, Version 6.0) 
Rega rding Mitomycin C -related adverse events , please note:  
• Mytomicin  C may cause burning sensation in the ureter, hand skin exfoliation (removal 
of dead skin cells), blood count changes, inflammation of the organ, soreness/pain in the 
area, soreness of the skin in the area around the openings of the urethra.  
 
• Mitomycin C c an have also some side effects, including cystitis (bladder infection), 
frequent and / or painful urination, night -time urination or blood in the urine, allergic 
reactions in form of rashes or erythema (redness of the skin or painful itching) of a 
portion of the skin (i.e. palms and feet) or of the entire skin surface, contact dermatitis, 
generalized exanthemas (skin breakouts), skin peeling on the palms with/without 
generalized rash.  
 
Rare:  
• Blood line suppression - decreased white blood cells (increases i nfection risk), red blood 
cells (increases fatigue risk), and platelets (increases bleeding and bruising risk)   
• Death of cells of the urinary tract  
• Narrowed  urethra (stenosis ) Necrotizing severe cystitis (inflammation and dying of cells) 
are also very rare.  
• Cases of bladder shrinking with reduced bladder capacity have been described  
• Teratogenic effects (developmental disturbances) on emb ryo/foetus have been previously 
described.  
 
Previous studies using the MMC in association with TC -3 gel showed few side effects from 
the treatments which are related and expected to the treatments with MMC. Among the side 
effects have been found also urin ary burning, urinary tract infections (UTI) and dysuria, which 
were resolved with or without any treatment.  
 
Anticipated TC -3 Gel Related Adverse Events:  
Common:  
• A sensation of bladder contractions due to the cold temperature of the instilled gel.  
• A sensation of upper urinary tract contractions  due to the cold temperature of the instilled 
gel. 
 
• Rare: Upper  urinary tract obstruction which occurred once due to violation of treatment 
instructions.  
 
Anticipated MitoGel -Related Phenomena (not an adverse event ) 
• Purple colored urine  
• Urination of gel particles  
 
MMC+TC -3 may cause low blood cell counts (red blood ce lls, white blood cells, and/or 
platelets) that may require a transfusion, but this is very rare in local administration.  
Following are rare some side effects that were noticed during compassionate treatments:  
 
18November 2018   Patient Consent Form, Version 7.0 Page 13 of 19 
(Protocol TC-UT-03, Version 6.0) 
 
• “Cool” flank sensation due to low temperature of instilled drug.  
•  narrowing of the ureter at location of the previously available tumor (Narrowing 
originated either f rom drug effect on the tissue or mechanical injury by rapidly inserted 
ureteral catheter). The event resolved following local treatment.  
•  Bladder inflammation and upper tract inflammation (due to treatment drug)  
• Enhanced frequency of urination (probably du e to bladder irritation by the drug)  
• Hydronephrosis (distention of the kidney  with urine as a result of obstruction of the 
outflow of urine) due to local edema caused by inflammation of the upper tract.  
 
 
Risks and side effects associated with Bicarbonate  
Sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) is generally well tolerated. However, high doses may cause 
headache, nausea or irritability. If any of these effects continue or become bothersome, inform 
your doctor.  
 
Risks and side effects associated with a biopsy  
Having biopsies  performed in the upper urinary tract may cause pain, local bruising, bleeding, 
redness, swelling, and/or infection at the site of the biopsies.  An allergic reaction to the 
anesthetic may occ ur.  A scar may form at the biopsy site.  
 
Cytoscopy  
Cystoscopy is generally a safe procedure. Serious complications are rare. However, as with any 
surgery, there is the risk of infection, bleeding, and complications from the anesthesia. In all but 
the simp lest procedures, antibiotics are used before the surgery to reduce the incidence of urinary 
tract infection.  
 
Side effects due to Blood Draws  
Blood draws may cause pain, bleeding, and/or bruising.  You may faint and/or develop an 
infection with redness and  irritation of the vein at the site where blood is drawn.  Frequent blood 
collection may cause anemia (low red blood cell count), which may create a need for blood 
transfusions, but in this study the amount of blood drawn is limited and the risk for blood 
transfusion is extremely rare.  
 
This study involves exposure to radiation, and that exposure is increased the more often such 
tests are done. Radiation exposure at certain doses can potentially cause cancer. Any possible 
increase in cancer risk associated with participation in this study is within acceptable limits for 
human research subjects.  
 
Fluoroscopy  
Fluoroscopy involve the risks of radiation . Radiation -related risks associated with fluoroscopy 
include:  
 
18November 2018   Patient Consent Form, Version 7.0 Page 14 of 19 
(Protocol TC-UT-03, Version 6.0) 
• Radiation -induced injuries to the skin and underlying tissues (“burns”), which occur 
shortly after the exposure, and  
• Radiation -induced cancers, which may occur 22sometime later in life.  
 
The probability that you will experience these effects from a fluoroscopic procedure is 
statistically very small .  
 
 
CT Scan Risks  
CT scans involve the risks of radiation  (above)  .In addition, if contrast material (iodine dye) is 
used, there is a slight risk of developing an allergic reaction, which may cause symptoms ranging 
from mild itching or a rash to severe di fficulty breathing, shock, or rarely, death. The contrast 
material may also cause kidney problems, especially if you are dehydrated or have poor kidney 
function. The study doctors will ask you about any allergies or related conditions before the 
procedure.  If you have any of these problems, you may not be allowed to have a CT scan.  
 
Having a CT scan may mean some added discomfort for you. In particular, you may be bothered 
by feelings of claustrophobia when placed inside the CT scanner, or by lying in one position for 
a long time. If contrast material is used, you may feel discomfort when it is injected. You may 
feel warm and flushed and get a metallic taste in your mouth. Rarely, the contrast material may 
cause nausea, vomiting or a headache.  
 
MRI Risks   
An MRI scan is a painless radiology technique that has the advantage of avoiding x -ray radiation 
exposure. There are no known side effects of an MRI scan. During the MRI scan, patient lies in a 
closed area inside the magnetic tube. Some patients can  experience a claustrophobic sensation 
during the procedure. If you have history of claustrophobia  please relate this to the treating 
urologist, as well as the radiology staff.  
If you have any metallic materials within the body please notify your treating urologist prior to 
the examination or inform the MRI staff. Metallic chips, materials, surgical clips, or foreign 
material (artificial joints, metallic bone plates, or prosthetic devices, etc.) can significantly distort 
the images obtained by the MRI scanner. If you have a heart pacemakers, metal implants, or 
metal chips or clips in or around the eyeballs you should not be scanned with an  MRI because of 
the risk that the magnet may move the metal in these areas. If you have artificial heart  valves, 
metallic ear implants, bullet fragments, and chemotherapy  or insulin  pumps you should not have 
MRI scanning.  
 
 
 
Reproductive Risks:  
You should not become pregnant or father a baby while on this study because the drugs in this 
study can affect an unborn baby. Women should not breastfeed a baby while on this study. 
Therefore, you need to use effective birth control wh ile on this study.  You must use at least 2 
acceptable and effective methods of birth -control (like implants, injectable, combined 
estrogen/progesterone oral contraceptives and/or condoms with spermicide).

(Protocol TC-UT-03, Version 6.0) 
 
Unknown Risks to Women of Child Bearing Potential  and Pregnant Women: The effects of 
the study medication on fertility or a fetus are not known. For this reason, if you believe that you 
are pregnant or have a chance of becoming pregnant you should not participate in this study. A 
urine pregnancy test wil l be performed before the start of study procedures. If you are pregnant, 
you will not be allowed to participate in the study. If you do participate in this study, you must 
use a medically effective form of birth control before entering the study, while pa rticipating in 
the study, and for at least 6 months after stopping the study. If you become pregnant during the 
study, tell the researchers right away.  
 
Unknown risks to infants : The side effects of the study medication on infants are also not 
known, ther efore if you are currently breastfeeding you cannot participate in this study.  
 
Unknown risks and discomforts  
The experimental treatments may have side effects that no one knows about yet.  The researchers 
will let you know if they learn anything that mig ht make you change your mind about 
participating in the study .  
 
As with any other new treatment this treatment may involve unpredictable risks to you  
 
ARE THERE ANY BENEFITS TO TAKING PART IN THE STUDY?  
 
You may or may not benefit from participation in this study. Treatment with the drug may help 
to control the disease, but there may be no benefits to you for receiving this treatment.  
 
The following are possible benefits from study treatment:  
 
- The tumors might disappear and subsequently no need for surgical removal would exist.  
- Additionally, in case of reduction of the number or size of the lesion(s) in comparison 
with baseline, the following surgical removal would be more limited;  
- A more effic ient preventive effect of tumor recurrence might be proven . 
 
From what has been shown so far  in the sponsor trials in urothelial carcinoma in the bladder , 
Mitomycin C appears to have a high potential for tumor removal, with more than 70% of the 
patients sh owing complete response to the treatment, and more than 80% of the patients showing 
either complete response or partial response. Moreover, the results suggest that the treatment 
appears to be generally safe and there has been no indication of a significan t rise in risk related to 
the Mitomycin C dose used.  
 
The information generated by your participation may help future patients with Low Grade Upper 
Urinary Urothelial Carcinoma (UTUC).

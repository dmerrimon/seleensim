TitleA Study of the Safety, Immunopharmacodynamics and Anti-tumor Activity 
of Ibrutinib Combined with Gemcitabine and Nab-Paclitaxel in Patients 
with Metastatic Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma
Patient 
populationPatients with previously  untreated metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma
Rationale for 
StudyGemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel is a standard regimen (NCCN, Category 1) for 
patients with metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). However, 
further improvement in treatment is needed. Increasingly, the nature of the 
immune infiltrate in PDAC appears to be tumor promoting. In preclinical 
studies, ibrutinib treatment, presumably by reprogramming B cells, results in 
increased CD8+ T cells to assist in tumor control. Preclinical studies of 
ibrutinib plus gemcitabine show superior antitumor effects compared to 
gemcitabine alone in both orthotopic murine pancreatic cancer cell line grafts 
and in genetically engineered mouse models. Thus, we propose a clinical trial 
of ibrutinib plus the standard gemcitabine based regimen of gemcitabine and 
nab-paclitaxel, evaluating safety, then efficacy and including correlative 
studies.
Primary 
ObjectivesPhase Ib:
To determine the maximum tolerated dose of ibrutinib in combination with 
albumin bound 
paclitaxel and gemcitabine in patients with metastatic 
pancreatic adenocarcinoma.
Immune Response Study: 
To
 monitor the changes in the patients’ immune profiles during treatment 
with 
ibrutinib, alone and in combination with gemcitabine and nab-
paclitaxel, in the pancreatic tumor micro-environment (TME) and in the 
peripheral blood.
To confirm the pharmacodynamics of ibrutinib at dosing level 560 mg/day
To explore the relationships between the pharmacodynamics of ibrutinib in 
combination 
with nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine and response prediction 
biomarkers in patients with metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma. 
Secondary 
ObjectivesPhase Ib: 
To evaluate the safety of treatment with ibrutinib in combination with nab-
paclitaxel 
and gemcitabine in patients with metastatic pancreatic 
adenocarcinoma.
To evaluate the potential drug-drug interaction of ibrutinib in combination 
with 
nab-Paclitaxel and gemcitabine in patients with metastatic pancreatic 
V4(28SEP2016) Protocol CC#:144525 
Phase I/Immune Response – Ibrutinib Page 4 of 100adenocarcinoma.
To clinically assess the anti-tumor effects of treatment with ibrutinib in 
combination 
with nab-Paclitaxel and gemcitabine. 
Immune Response Study: 
To
 verify and confirm the safety of ibrutinib in combination with nab-
paclitaxel 
and gemcitabine in patients with metastatic pancreatic 
adenocarcinoma.
To estimate the CA19-9 clinical response rate of patients with metastatic 
pancreatic 
adenocarcinoma treated with ibrutinib in combination with nab-
Paclitaxel and gemcitabine.
To estimate the Progression-Free Survival and Time-to-Progression and 
Overall 
survival of patients with metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma 
treated with ibrutinib in combination with nab-Paclitaxel and gemcitabine.
Study Design
This is a phase open-label study, designed to assess the safety and 
immunopharmicodynamics of
 ibrutinib in combination with the standard doses 
of gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel for treating advanced pancreatic 
adenocarcinoma.  
Phase Ib :  Patients will be enrolled in the 3+3 dose escalation cohort to 
assess the 
safety and tolerability of the combination therapy of ibrutinib, 
gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel*.  Dosing escalation will commence at the 560 
mg/day dose, and if no DLT is identified in the first 3 patients, the next dosing 
cohort will receive ibrutinib at 840 mg/day.  If a DLT is identified at 560 mg/day 
or at 840 mg/day, dose de-escalation will begin with dosing cohorts receiving 
560 mg/day, 420 mg/day, and 280 mg/day as necessary.  Grade 4 
hematologic adverse events are expected based on prior experience with 
gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel, and support with colony stimulating factor will 
be allowed.   If no DLT is identified at 840 mg/day, then 840 mg/day will be 
considered the Maximum Tolerated Dose.  
Immune Response Study :  Patients will begin treatment with a one-week 
run-in of 560 mg/day of ibrutinib only.  Each patient will undergo two EUS-
guided biopsies, at least 5 days before and at least 5 days after the one-week 
run-in of ibrutinib. Combination therapy with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel 
will begin no later than 3 days after the second biopsy, and treatment with 
ibrutinib will resume 5-7 days after biopsy.  The tissue samples acquired 
through biopsy will be used to assess the pharmacodynamic relationship 
between treatment with ibrutinib alone and changes in the tumor 
microenvironment. Serial blood samples will be taken to monitor changes in 
circulating cytokines, to define the B and T cell receptor repertoires and the 
characteristics of circulating myeloid cells. 
Patients enrolled and treated in thephase  Ib dose escalation and the Immune 
Response cohorts will continue to receive combination therapy until 
V4(28SEP2016) Protocol CC#:144525 
Phase I/Immune Response – Ibrutinib Page 5 of 100documented disease progression,  unless discontinuing therapy for the 
following reasons:
Irreversible or intolerable  toxicity or clinically significant abnormal 
laboratory values thought to be related to drug toxicity 
Patient withdraws consent
Treatment-related toxicities  that require a delay in scheduled dosing for 
≥21 days*
Documented symptomatic  deterioration defined as global or severe 
deterioration of health status such that it requires discontinuation of trial 
treatment without evidence of disease progression at that time.
Inability of  the patient to comply with trial requirements or lost to follow-
up
Conditions requiring a therapeutic intervention not permitted by the 
protocol
Intercurrent illness (this will be at the investigator’s discretion)
*In the event that a drug must be held for intolerability (ie neuropathy for nab-
paclitaxel 
or rash for gemcitabine) for more than 21 days, patients may 
continue on study receiving the other drugs, including ibrutinib.

1.1 Background Current Treatment of Advanced Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma
Pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC)  represents the fourth leading cause of cancer-related 
mortality in the United States, with an estimated 39,950 deaths attributable to PDAC in 2014 
(http://seer.cancer.gov/statfacts/html/pancreas.html). Over 90% of patients have inoperable 
disease at presentation, at which point systemic therapy becomes the primary form of 
treatment.
Treating PDAC has been challenging and few approved drugs are available. Recently, however, 
some breakthroughs have occurred, raising hope that this aggressive disease can be better 
controlled. FOLFIRINOX, a combination of 5FU, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan, has been found to 
be substantially superior to treatment of gemcitabine alone in patients with metastatic disease 
and good performance status [1].  Similarly, gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel, a regimen with less 
non-hematologic toxicity, demonstrated improved overall survival and progression-free survival 
compared to gemcitabine alone [2].  Both of these combinations or modifications of these 
combinations are now front line options for patients with good performance status. Furthermore, 
these improvements in survival, however incremental, now afford patients with pancreatic 
cancer time to participate in and possibly benefit from clinical trials of novel therapeutics. 
1.2 Immunotherapy for Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma
Immunotherapy—recruiting a patient’s immune system to recognize and destroy malignant cells 
and control their spread—has been an ideal pursued by clinical researchers for decades.  
However, there have been very few clinical successes in the treatment of solid tumors with 
immunotherapeutic agents such as tumor-specific (TSA) and tumor-associated antigen (TAA) 
vaccines, cytokines, interleukins and other immune-modulators.  One explanation for the lack of 
success for patients with pancreatic cancer may be that global depression of the immune state 
is a characteristic of the disease—this is supported by reports of depressed or anergic immune 
responses to both common and tumor antigens in PDAC patients [3, 4].  And yet there have 
also been reports of pre-existing or natural functional tumor-reactive T cells in the peripheral 
blood and bone marrow of PDAC patients [5-7].  Furthermore, responses to tumor antigens, 
i.e.anti-TAA antibodies or TAA-reactive T-cells, have been detected in the peripheral blood of 
PDAC patients treated with tumor-derived vaccines, and in some cases these responses appear 
to correlate with better outcomes [8-10].  However, significant improvements in patient survival 
have yet to be confirmed in randomized well-controlled clinical trials.
It is now widely appreciated that the stromal environment of pancreatic tumors and other solid 
tumors 
is highly immune-suppressive relative to normal tissue.   There is a greater density of the 
immune suppressive FOXP3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) in the human pancreatic  tumor infiltrate 
compared to normal pancreatic tissue [11-13].  While T cells comprise the majority of the tumor 
infiltrate, surprisingly, the most prevalent are CD8+ T cells of the antigen-experienced effector 
phenotype, capable of producing IFN-γ once removed from the influence of the regulatory 
factors of the tumor stroma [14].  The presence of FOXP3+Tregs as well as Th17 and myeloid-
derived suppressor cells in the PDAC stroma [14] suggests that there are several immune 
suppressive mechanisms and checkpoints protecting pancreatic tumor cells from destruction.  
Checkpoint-directed therapies such as ipilimumab (CTLA-4) and nivolumab (PD-1) have been 
evaluated clinically and have shown activity in other solid tumors, but none have demonstrated 
efficacy in PDAC cohorts as single-agents [15, 16].  Making headway in the treatment of PDAC 
V4(28SEP2016) Protocol CC#:144525 
Phase I/Immune Response – Ibrutinib Page 16 of 100will most likely require combination therapies with check-point inhibitors, vaccines and other 
agents 
designed to alter the immune program of the tumor-associated stroma [8, 17-19].
1.3 Rationale for Targeting Regulatory B Cells in Treating Pancreatic Cancer
Preliminary preclinical data  indicate that B cells may play an important pro-tumor role in PDAC.  
It was previously reported that B cells promote squamous cell carcinogenesis (SCC) via Fcγ 
receptor-dependent activation of tumor-infiltrating myeloid cells, mediated by immunoglobulin 
(Ig)-containing immune complexes deposited in (pre)malignant tissue [20, 21].  More recently, 
the same model was used to evaluate this neoplastic cell-extrinsic pathway as an anti-cancer 
target using B-cell depleting αCD20 monoclonal antibodies. In prevention and intervention 
mouse models, neoplastic progression stopped at an early hyperplastic stage subsequent to B 
cell depletion [22].  
The presence of B cell infiltration  in human PDAC has been confirmed ex vivo (Coussens, et 
al.manuscript in preparation)  (Figure 1): tumor tissue analyzed by Affymetrix U133 Plus 2 
microarrays and by immunohistochemical methods exhibited the molecular and histopathologic 
characteristics of B cell or plasma cell infiltration, i.e. increased expression of CD20 or Ig mRNA 
in tumor lysates, as well as a significantly increased presence of CD20-positive B cells in tumor 
relative to normal pancreas in tissue sections. Furthermore, the density of B cell infiltration 
significantly correlated with decreased overall survival.  
Figure 1. Leukocytes in Human PDAC
To investigate the  B-cell specific contribution to PDAC tumor growth in vivo, B cell- and/or FcγR-
deficient mice were assessed for their ability to support growth of syngeneic orthotopic PDAC 
V4(28SEP2016) Protocol CC#:144525 
Phase I/Immune Response – Ibrutinib Page 17 of 100(Figure 2).  Growth  of PDAC tumors in mice homozygous for FcγR deficiency was significantly 
attentuated compared to the the tumors in their wild-type and heterozygous littermates. 
Moreover, αCD20 mAb-mediated B cell depletion slowed growth of preexisting PDACs.  
Macrophages isolated from PDAC tumors of αCD20 mAb -treated mice displayed 
characteristics indicative of functional type 1 re-education, concomitant with an increased 
presence of CD8+ T cells (data not shown). These data indicate that B cells, and the 
downstream myeloid-based pathways they regulate, represent tractable targets for anti-cancer 
therapy, and suggest that the immune TME in susceptible solid tumors can be effectively re-
educated to promote productive anti-tumor immune responses. 
Figure 2.  B cells and FcRγ regulate PDAC
1.4 Rationale for Targeting Bruton’s Tyrosine Kinase with Ibrutinib to Alter TME of 
PDA
Normal and malignant B cells are dependent on functional Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (Btk) for 
activation, maturation and survival.  Coussins et al evaluated the presence of active Btk (pBtk) 
in immune cells infiltrating orthotopic murine PDAC tumors by flow cytometry, and 
immunohistochemically in human PDAC tissue sections (Figure 3A and B).  Results from these 
studies indicate that pBtk is present in B cells and myeloid cells of murine and human PDAC. 
Based on these results, mice harboring syngeneic orthotopic PDAC at late-stage were treated  
with an FDA-approved BTK inhibitor (BTKi) (PCI-32765, ibrutinib) as monotherapy and in 
combination with gemcitabine, which resulted in significant reductions in tumor burden at end 
stage (Fig. 3C). Moreover, treatment of KPC transgenic mice predisposed to de novo pancreatic 
carcinogenesis with ibrutinib plus gemcitabine lead to significantly improved OS as compared to 
gemcitabine alone (Fig. 3D). By using a CD8+ T cell-depleting mAb, it was revealed that 
improved outcomes of mice treated with ibrutinib/gemcitabine are dependent on CD8+ T cells 
(Fig. 3E).
V4(28SEP2016) Protocol CC#:144525 
Phase I/Immune Response – Ibrutinib Page 18 of 100Figure 3. Btk as a therapeutic target in PDAC
Inhibition of Btk  has additional immune effects which have the potential to translate into anti-
tumor activity. Btk plays a critical role in inducible degranulation of Mast Cells [23], a process 
which has been shown to promote stromal changes that contribute to neoplastic transformation 
and tumor neoangiogenesis [24].  Systemic treatment with ibrutinib blocks mast cell 
degranulation in vivo, triggering collapse of tumor vasculature as well as tumor regression in 
insulinoma-bearing mice [24].  In another preclinical model (Massó-Vallés, et al, submitted 
manuscript), pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC)-bearing mice treated with Ibrutinib 
survived longer and presented with reduced tumor stroma, suggesting that targeting Mast Cells 
in patients with pancreatic cancer may positively alter the stromal architecture that protects and 
supports the growth of tumor tissue.    
Ibrutinib also targets structural homologues of Btk, and has been shown to irreversibly bind and 
inhibit interleukin 2-inducible T cell kinase (ITK)[25].  Activated ITK is implicated in maintaining 
dysregulated Th2-biased immunosuppression of T cell-mediated anti-tumor responses. 
Inhibition with ibrutinib selectively reversed Th2 bias to favor activation of Th1 t cells, further 
augmenting the immunotherapeutic effect.
1.5 Rationale of  Combining Ibrutinib with Gemcitabine and nab-Paclitaxel
Gemicitabine plus nab-paclitaxel is currently one of the two standard 1st line treatments for 
PDAC, and is regarded as a less toxic and more tolerable regimen than the combination 
V4(28SEP2016) Protocol CC#:144525 
Phase I/Immune Response – Ibrutinib Page 19 of 100chemotherapy FOLFIRINOX. Clinically,  gemcitabine may be the chemotherapeutic of choice for 
combination with immunotherapeutics: Treating PDAC patients with single agent gemcitabine 
does not appear to significantly alter the absolute number of functional CD8 and CD4 T cells, B 
cells or dendritic precursors in the peripheral blood, although a decrease in the number of 
memory T-cells and an increase in naïve T-cell activation was observed [26] and;  treatment 
with gemcitabine-based therapies was reported to significantly decrease both the percentage 
and number of Tregs in the peripheral blood while having no effect on the number and function 
of other immune cells[27] [28].  Adding nab-paclitaxel to gemcitabine significantly extends 
survival, providing PDAC patients much needed time to mount effective anti-tumor responses, 
and pre-clinical studies suggest that nab-paclitaxel may accelerate depletion of the PDAC tumor 
stroma which supports tumor growth and immune tolerance [29]. The ability of Btk inhibitors to 
reprogram B cells and to block activation of signaling pathways downstream of Btk in both B 
cells and myeloid cells suggests that combining ibrutinib with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel to 
treat patients with PDAC may promote an anti-tumor immune response in the clinical setting.
1.6 Ibrutinib
Ibrutinib is a first-in-class, potent, orally administered covalently-binding inhibitor of Bruton’s 
tyrosine 
kinase (BTK).  Inhibition of BTK blocks downstream B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling 
pathways and thus prevents B-cell proliferation. In vitro, ibrutinib inhibits purified BTK and 
selected members of the kinase family with 10-fold specificity compared with non-BTK kinases.  
Ibrutinib (IMBRUVICA®) is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the 
treatment of : 1) mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) in patients who have received at least one prior 
therapy, 2) chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) , and 3) Waldenström’s Macroglobulinemia..  
Ibrutinib is currently under investigation in various indications.  
B cells are lymphocytes with multiple functions in the immune response, including antigen 
presentation, 
antibody production, and cytokine release.  B-cells express cell surface 
immunoglobulins comprising the B-cell receptor (BCR), which is activated by binding to antigen.  
Antigen binding induces receptor aggregation and the clustering and activation of multiple 
tyrosine kinases, which in turn activate further downstream signaling pathways [30]. 
The process of B-cell maturation, including immunoglobulin chain rearrangement and somatic 
mutation, is tightly regulated.  It is thought that B-cell lymphomas and CLL result from mutations 
and translocations acquired during normal B-cell development [31].  Several lines of evidence 
suggest that signaling through the BCR is necessary to sustain the viability of B-cell 
malignancies.  
The role of BTK in BCR signal transduction is demonstrated by the human genetic 
immunodeficiency 
disease X-linked agammaglobulinemia and the mouse genetic disease X-
linked immunodeficiency, both caused by a mutation in the BTK gene.  These genetic diseases 
are characterized by reduced BCR signaling and failure to generate mature B-cells.  The BTK 
protein is expressed in most hematopoietic cells with the exception of T-cells and natural killer 
cells, but the selective effect of BTK mutations suggests that its primary functional role is in 
antigen receptor signaling in B-cells [32].  
Data from Study PCYC-04753 demonstrate that although ibrutinib is rapidly eliminated from the 
plasma after 
oral administration, once daily dosing with ibrutinib is adequate to sustain maximal 
pharmacodynamic activity for 24 hours postdose at dose levels ≥2.5 mg/kg. In Study PCYC-
04753, the BTK occupancies for the 2.5 mg/kg/day to 12.5 mg/kg/day cohorts and for the 560 
V4(28SEP2016) Protocol CC#:144525 
Phase I/Immune Response – Ibrutinib Page 20 of 100mg continuous dosing cohort, were all above 90% at either 4 or 24 hours after drug 
administration.

safety, 
efficacy, and in vitro and in vivo preclinical activity and toxicology of ibrutinib, refer to the 
latest version of the ibrutinib Investigator's Brochure.
1.7 Summary of  Non-Clinical Data
For the most comprehensive nonclinical information regarding ibrutinib, refer to the current 
version of 
the Investigator's Brochure
1.7.1 Pharmacology
Ibrutinib was designed as a selective  and covalent inhibitor of the Btk (Pan 2007).  In vitro, 
ibrutinib is a potent inhibitor of Btk activity (IC50 = 0.39 nM).  The irreversible binding of ibrutinib 
to cysteine-481 in the active site of Btk results in sustained inhibition of Btk catalytic activity and 
enhanced selectivity over other kinases that do not contain a cysteine at this position.  When 
added directly to human whole blood, ibrutinib inhibits signal transduction from the B-cell 
receptor and blocks primary B-cell activation (IC50 = 80 nM) as assayed by anti-IgM stimulation 
followed by CD69 expression (Herman 2011)  
For more detailed and comprehensive information regarding nonclinical pharmacology, refer to 
the 
current Investigator’s Brochure. For additional information, see FDA’s Guidance Definitions 
for Genomic Biomarkers, Pharmacogenomics,  Pharmacogenetics, Genomic Data and Sample 
Coding Categories  and CTEP’s  Guidelines for Correlative  Studies in Clinical Trials .  Toxicology
In safety pharmacology assessments, no treatment-related effects were observed in the central 
nervous system 
or respiratory system in rats at any dose tested.  Further, no treatment-related 
corrected QT interval (QTc) prolongation effect was observed at any tested dose in a 
cardiovascular study using telemetry-monitored dogs.  
Based on data from rat and dog including general toxicity studies up to 13 weeks duration, the 
greatest 
potential for human toxicity with ibrutinib is predicted to be in lymphoid tissues 
(lymphoid depletion) and the gastrointestinal tract (soft feces/diarrhea with or without 
inflammation).  Additional toxicity findings seen in only one species with no observed human 
correlate in clinical studies to date include pancreatic acinar cell atrophy (rat), minimally 
decreased trabecular and cortical bone (rat) and corneal dystrophy (dog).  
In vitro and in vivo genetic toxicity studies showed that ibrutinib is not genotoxic.  In a rat 
embryo-fetal 
toxicity study ibrutinib administration was associated with fetal loss and 
malformations (teratogenicity) at ibrutinib doses that result in approximately 6 times and 14 
times the exposure (AUC) in patients administered the dose of 560 mg daily, respectively.  
1.7.2 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility
Carcinogenicity studies have not  been conducted with ibrutinib.
V4(28SEP2016) Protocol CC#:144525 
Phase I/Immune Response – Ibrutinib Page 21 of 100Ibrutinib was not mutagenic in a bacterial mutagenicity (Ames) assay, was not clastogenic in a 
chromosome aberration assay in mammalian (CHO) cells, nor was it clastogenic in an in vivo 
bone marrow micronucleus assay in mice at doses up to 2000 mg/kg.
Fertility studies with ibrutinib  have not been conducted in animals. In the general toxicology 
studies conducted in rats and dogs, orally administered ibrutinib did not result in adverse effects 
on reproductive organs.
1.8 Summary of  Clinical Data
For the most comprehensive clinical information regarding ibrutinib, refer to the current version 
of 
the Investigator's Brochure.
1.8.1 Pharmacokinetics and Product Metabolism
Following oral administration of  ibrutinib at doses ranging from 1.25 to 12.5 mg/kg/day as well 
as fixed dose levels of 420, 560, and 840 mg/day, exposure to ibrutinib increased as doses 
increased with substantial intersubject variability.  The mean half-life (t1/2) of ibrutinib across 3 
clinical studies ranged from 4 to 9 hours, with a median time to maximum plasma concentration 
(Tmax) of 2 hours. Taking into account the approximate doubling in mean systemic exposure 
when dosed with food and the favorable safety profile, ibrutinib can be dosed with or without 
food. Ibrutinib is extensively metabolized primarily by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4. The on-
target effects of metabolite PCI-45227 are not considered clinically relevant. Steady-state 
exposure of ibrutinib and PCI-45227 was less than 2-fold of first dose exposure. Less than 1% of 
ibrutinib is excreted renally. Ibrutinib exposure is not altered in patients with creatinine clearance 
(CrCl) >30 mL/min. Patients with severe renal impairment or patients on dialysis have not been 
studied. Following single dose administration, the AUC of ibrutinib increased 2.7-, 8.2- and 9.8-
fold in subjects with mild (Child-Pugh class A), moderate (Child-Pugh class B), and severe 
(Child-Pugh class C) hepatic impairment compared to subjects with normal liver function.  A 
higher proportion of Grade 3 or higher adverse reactions were reported in patients with B-cell 
malignancies (CLL, MCL and WM) with mild hepatic impairment based on NCI organ 
dysfunction working group (NCI-ODWG) criteria for hepatic dysfunction compared to patients 
with normal hepatic function.

1.8.3 Treatment Discontinuations
As
 of 6 April 2013, 71/636 subjects discontinued treatment due to an adverse event, across the 
monotherapy 
and combination therapy ibrutinib studies (excluding Study PCYC-1103-CA); 62 
subjects receiving monotherapy population and 9 subjects receiving combination therapy.  The 
V4(28SEP2016) Protocol CC#:144525 
Phase I/Immune Response – Ibrutinib Page 23 of 100most frequently reported  adverse events that led to treatment discontinuations were pneumonia 
(13 subjects), respiratory failure (4 subjects), and cardiac arrest and Richter’s Syndrome (3 
subjects each).  
1.8.4 Bleeding-related events 
There
 have been reports  of hemorrhagic events in subjects treated with ibrutinib, both with and 
without thrombocytopenia. These include minor hemorrhagic events such as contusion, 
epistaxis, and petechiae; and major hemorrhagic events, some fatal, including gastrointestinal 
bleeding, intracranial hemorrhage, and hematuria. Use of ibrutinib in subjects requiring other 
anticoagulants or medications that inhibit platelet function may increase the risk of bleeding. 
Subjects with congenital bleeding diathesis have not been studied. 
1.8.5 Cardiac
Atrial fibrillation and atrial  flutter have been reported in subjects treated with ibrutinib, particularly 
in subjects with cardiac risk factors, hypertension, acute infections, and a previous history of 
atrial fibrillation. Subjects with a history of cardiac arrhythmias should be monitored closely.
1.8.6 Rash
Mild to moderate rashes have been  observed with ibrutinib alone or in combination with other 
drugs. A single case of Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS) was reported in a male subject with 
CLL treated with ibrutinib 420 mg/day. The subject was also receiving multiple concomitant 
medications known to be associated with SJS. Subjects should be monitored closely for signs 
and symptoms suggestive of SJS.
1.8.7 Non-Melanoma Skin Cancer
Non‑melanoma skin cancers have occurred in patients treated with ibrutinib.  Monitor patients 
for the appearance of non‑melanoma skin cancer.
1.8.8 Infections
Fatal and non-fatal infections have occurred with ibrutinib therapy. At least 25% of subjects with 
MCL and 35% of subjects 
with CLL had Grade 3 or greater infections per NCI Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE v4.02). The most commonly reported 
infections include pneumonia, cellulitis, urinary tract infection and sepsis. Although causality has 
not been established, cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) have 
occurred in patients treated with ibrutinib.
1.8.9 Cytopenias 
Treatment-emergent 
Grade 3 or 4 cytopenias  (neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia) 
were reported in subjects treated with ibrutinib. 
1.8.10 Diarrhea 
Diarrhea is the most frequently
 reported non-hematologic AE with ibrutinib monotherapy and 
combination 
therapy. Other frequently reported gastrointestinal events include nausea, vomiting, 
and constipation. These events are rarely severe. Should symptoms be severe or prolonged 
follow the protocol dose modification guidelines.

3.1.3 Duration of  and Discontinuation from Protocol Therapy
Patients will be treated until disease progression, or will be discontinued from protocol treatment 
for any of the following reasons:
• Documented disease progression
V4(28SEP2016) Protocol CC#:144525 
Phase I/Immune Response – Ibrutinib Page 29 of 100• Irreversible or intolerable  toxicity or clinically significant abnormal laboratory values 
thought to be related to drug toxicity (per section 6.2)
• Patient requests to  withdraw from the trial or discontinue treatment
• Treatment-related toxicities  that require a delay in scheduled dosing for ≥21 days*
• Documented symptomatic  deterioration defined as global or severe deterioration of 
health status such that it requires discontinuation of trial treatment without evidence of 
disease progression at that time.
• Inability of the  patient to comply with trial requirements or lost to follow-up
• Conditions requiring a therapeutic intervention not permitted by the protocol
• Intercurrent illness (this will be at the investigator’s discretion)
*In the event that a drug must be held for intolerability (ie neuropathy for nab-paclitaxel or rash 
for 
gemcitabine) for more than 21 days, patients may continue on study receiving the other 
drugs, including ibrutinib.
After discontinuation from protocol  treatment, patients must be followed for AEs for 30 calendar 
days after their last dose of study drug.  All new AEs occurring during this period must be 
reported and followed until resolution, unless, in the opinion of the investigator, these values are 
not likely to improve because of the underlying disease.  In this case, the investigators must 
record his or her reasoning for this decision in the patients’ medical records and as a comment 
on the Case Report Form (CRF).
All patients who have Grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormalities (Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse 
Events [CTCAE] v 4.03) at the time of discontinuation must be followed until the 
laboratory values have returned to Grade 1 or 2, unless it is, in the opinion of the investigator, 
not likely that these values are to improve.  In this case, the investigator must record his or her 
reasoning for making this decision in the patients’ medical records and as a comment on the 
CRF.
3.1.4 Pregnancy
During the course of the study, all female patients of childbearing potential (the definitions of 
“women of 
childbearing potential” are listed in Appendix 3)  must contact the treating 
investigator immediately if they suspect that they may be pregnant (a missed or late menstrual 
period).  
If an investigator suspects that a patient may be pregnant prior to administration of study 
drug(s), 
the study drug(s) must be withheld until the result of the pregnancy test is confirmed.  If 
a pregnancy is confirmed, the patient must not receive any study drug(s), and must be 
discontinued from the study.  
If an investigator suspects that a patient may be pregnant after the patient has been receiving 
study 
drug(s), the study drug(s) must immediately be withheld until the result of the pregnancy 
test is confirmed.  If a pregnancy is confirmed, the study drug(s) must be immediately and 
permanently stopped, the patient must be discontinued from the study, and the investigator 
must notify.  If a patient becomes pregnant while enrolled in the study, a Pregnancy Form (a 
V4(28SEP2016) Protocol CC#:144525 
Phase I/Immune Response – Ibrutinib Page 30 of 100paper report form) should be completed.  For more details regarding handling and reporting of 
pregnancies that occur during treatment, see Section 11.4.  
4 Trial Registration
The 
patient must willingly  consent after being informed of the procedures to be followed, the 
experimental nature of the treatment, potential benefits, alternatives, side-effects, risks and 
discomforts.  Human protection committee approval of this protocol and consent form is 
required.  
5 Treatment Plan
This
 is a phase Ib/Immune Response study of ibrutinib in combination with nab-paclitaxel and 
gemcitabine 
in the management of patients with metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma. 
The objective of the  phase Ib is to confirm the safety and toxicity of the combination of 
gemcitabine, nab-paclitaxel and ibrutinib in the management of patients with metastatic 
pancreatic adenocarcinoma.  In the first part of phase Ib, 15-30 patients will be enrolled in 3+3 
dose escalation cohorts to evaluate the safety of up to four doses of ibrutinib (280 mg, 420 mg, 
560 mg, and 840 mg QD), doses previously shown to be safe in healthy subjects and safe and 
effective in the management of patients with CLL and MCL. The first dosing cohort of 3 patients 
will receive 560 mg QD of ibrutinib in combination with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel.  Dose 
escalation will proceed to 840 mg QD unless a dose limiting toxicity is identified, in which case 3 
additional patients will receive 560 mg QD.  If 2 or more of 6 patients experience a DLT at 560 
mg QD, dosing will de-escalate to 420, and to 280 mg QD if necessary.  The dose level at which 
fewer than 2 of 6 patients experience a DLT will be designated as the Maximum Tolerated Dose 
(MTD). 
All patients in phase Ib will start treatment with daily dosing of ibrutinib concurrently with 
standard 
doses of gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel. A cycle is defined as 28 days.  Ibrutinib (560 
mg/day, 840 mg/day, or 420 and 280 mg/day if de-escalation is necessary) will be started on 
day 1.  Gemcitabine (1000 mg/m2) and nab-paclitaxel (125 mg/m2) will be given day 1, 8 and 
15 of each cycle. Since grade 4 hematologic adverse events are expected based on prior 
experience with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel, and support with colony stimulating factor will 
be allowed.  
Once the safety of the combination therapy is verified at the MTD, 20 patients will be enrolled in 
into 
the Immune Response Study. The objectives of the Immune Response Study are to assess 
the immunologic responses to and pharmacodynamics effects of pretreatment with ibrutinib 
alone.  To address these objectives, the 20 patients  will be enrolled, and will undergo two EUS-
guided biopsies, one before and one after one week of treatment with ibrutinib-only, after which 
the patients begin the combination treatment regimen.  Patients in the Immune Response study 
will be treated with 560 mg/day, unless 420 mg/day or 280 mg/day ibrutinib is determined to be 
the MTD in phase Ib. 
In both study phases and treatment cohorts, treatment effect will be monitored every 28 days by 
clinical exam and CA
 19-9. CT scans will be performed every other 28 day cycle and tumor 
measurements will be assessed using standard RECIST criteria.  Patients will continue on 
treatment until clinical or radiographic evidence of disease progression or until tolerance to 
treatment has been exceeded.

*Daily dosing in combination with nab-Paclitaxel at 125mg/m2 and Gemcitabine at 1000mg/m2 IV 
on day 1, 8, and 15.  If a dose is not taken at the scheduled time, it can be taken as soon as 
possible on the same day. 
5.2.1 Phase Ib Dose escalation
No more than two dose levels of ibrutinib will be evaluated in dose escalation.  If a DLT is 
identified 
at the 840 mg/d level, then 3 more patients will receive ibrutinib at the 560 mg/d dose 
to confirm that dosage as the maximum tolerated dose.  
Patients within a given dose cohort may be enrolled  concurrently given the well-established 
safety profile of ibrutinib and non-overlapping toxicities with chemotherapy. Although the safety 
profile of gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel plus ibrutinib (560 mg daily) has been established on a 
separate, currently enrolling, company-sponsored phase II/III trial of this combination in 
pancreatic cancer, the patients in the 840 mg/day dose cohort cannot be enrolled until the 
DSMC has completed the monitoring of the 560 mg/day cohort dose level patients and there is 
DSMC Chair approval for dose escalation to the next dose level (840 mg/day).
If DLT is identified at the 560 mg/d dose level (2 or more DLTs out of 6 patients dosed), a 
dosing de-escalation
 will begin at the 420 mg/d dose.  The lowest acceptable dose level is 280 
mg/d. 
5.2.2 Dose Limiting Toxicity
(DLT) will be defined as any unexpected grade 3 non-hematologic toxicity not reversible to 
grade 2 or less within 
96 hours, or any grade 4 toxicity. Grade 4 hematological toxicities will not 
be considered dose limiting in this trial since a significant fraction of patients who are treated 
with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel are expected to experience these toxicities.  Likewise, 
grade 3 peripheral neuropathy, a common and expected toxicity of treatment with nab-
paclitaxel, will not be considered a DLT.  DLT will be based on the first course of treatment.
Toxicity will be graded according to the NCI CTCAE version 4.03. To be evaluable for toxicity, a 
patient must receive at least one dose of any component of study therapy (ibrutinib, 
gemcitabine, or nab-paclitaxel). All patients enrolled are to be fully followed for DLT, and any 
patients who are not evaluable for toxicity will be replaced. 
V4(28SEP2016) Protocol CC#:144525 
Phase I/Immune Response – Ibrutinib Page 34 of 100The maximum tolerated dose of ibrutinib will be that dose at which fewer than one-third of 
patients experience a dose limiting toxicity.  If multiple toxicities are seen, the presence of dose 
limiting toxicity should be based on the most severe toxicity experienced.
5.2.3 Combination Therapy for Phase Ib and Immune Response cohorts
All patients in the Phase Ib safety and dose expansion and in Immune Response Study will 
received ibrutinib
 with nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine in cycles of approximately 28 days in 
length. Nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine are administered intravenously on days 1, 8 and 15 of 
each cycle.

5.2.4 One week run-in with Ibrutinib-only for the Immune Responses Study Cohort
Ibrutinib will be taken orally once per day during a 7 day run-in.  Due to increased risk of 
bleeding when taking ibrutinib, Day 1 of the run-in will begin no earlier than 5 days after the 
pretreatment biopsy.  Likewise, the post-run-in biopsy should be performed no earlier than 5 
days after the last dose of the 7 day run-in treatment period.  First infusions of gemcitabine and 
nab-paclitaxel may commence within 1-5 days after the post-run-in biopsy, but ibrutinib must be 
held until 5-7 days post-biopsy.
5.3 Study Treatment phase
Each treatment cycle generally is 28 days in length.  Treatment may be administered +/-2 days 
of the scheduled date without constituting a protocol violation.  Following the 1 week run-in with 
ibrutinib in the Immune Response cohort, the combination therapy treatment cycles will begin no 
earlier than 5 days after the 2nd biopsy, in 28-day cycles.  
Treatment may be administered +/-2 days of the scheduled date without constituting a protocol 
violation.  Ibrutinib is taken once daily; Nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine are administered on Day 
1, 8, and 15 of each cycle.  Patients will continue 28 day treatment cycles until disease 
progression or until other reasons for discontinuation from treatment.
Ibrutinib: 560, 840, 420,  or 280 or  mg, orally once per day:
V4(28SEP2016) Protocol CC#:144525 
Phase I/Immune Response – Ibrutinib Page 35 of 100All doses of ibrutinib  will be supplied by Pharmacyclics and dispensed by the Investigational 
Pharmacist or designee, and self-administered on an outpatient basis.  Each dose should be 
taken with approximately 8 ounces of water at the same time each day.  
Nab-Paclitaxel:  125mg/m2 IV Day 1,  8, and 15:  
Infuse over approximately 30-40 minutes or according to institutional standards.
Gemcitabine:  1000mg/m2 IV

completion 
of the nab-paclitaxel.
5.4 Restaging During the Combination Therapy Treatment Phase
Restaging by CT scans per RECIST version 1.1 (see Appendix 4) will occur every 2 cycles.
5.5 Assessments for Exploratory Endpoints
Immunologic studies will explore immune responses in the peripheral blood and the PDAC 
tumor micro-environment (TME).  The biopsy specimen, blood and serum samples will be 
collected at baseline and various key times during the course of treatment will be evaluated.  
Peripheral blood lymphocytes at each pre- and post each vaccination time-points will be 
collected and analyzed at USCF, OHSU, and UCSD.  
Biopsy analyses will include:  qualitative assessment of immune cell subsets such as T effectors, 
Tregs, NK cells, myeloid subsets, B cells and expression of immune checkpoint targets such as 
PD-1 and PD-L1, and CD40+ cells.  
Blood-based biomarkers, and serum will be analyzed by Luminex technology for changes in 30 
cytokines over time.  Quantitative and avidity evaluation of tumor infiltrating and peripheral blood 
mesothelin, Kras, and patient-specific mutation antigen-specific T cells will be analyzed.  
PBMC will undergo flow cytometry-based immune phenotyping and quantification.  T cells will 
be isolated 
for functional responses to mitogens as well as antigen specific functional responses 
to candidate pancreatic cancer antigens such as mesothelin or Kras using available peptide 
libraries and pMHC tetramers in response to treatment.  
DNA isolated from  PBMCs and tissue will be analyzed by deep sequencing to detect and track 
specific T cell and B cell receptor clones.  Gene and/or protein expression of circulating myeloid 
cells will be quantitatively evaluated.  All biopsies in the safety and efficacy portion of the study 
will be assessed by IHC.  Findings will be correlated with clinical endpoints.  
5.6 General Concomitant Medication and Supportive Care Guidelines
All concomitant medications  taken during the study will be documented in the CRF with the 
indication, dose information, and dates of administration.
V4(28SEP2016) Protocol CC#:144525 
Phase I/Immune Response – Ibrutinib Page 36 of 100• Patients should receive full supportive care during the study, including transfusion of 
blood and blood products, treatment with antibiotics, anti-emetics, anti-diarrheals, 
analgesics, erythropoietin, or bisphosphonates, when appropriate. 
• Alternatives should be sought for strong and moderate CYP3A inhibitors.
• Primary prophylaxis  with granulocyte colony stimulating factors (G-CSF) is not allowed 
but G-CSF may be used during the course of treatment per ASCO guidelines and the 
dose modification guidelines in Table  6 below if severe cytopenias develop.
Antiplatelet Agents and Anticoagulants
 Low molecular weight  (LMW) heparin may be used as an anticoagulant for 
thromboembolic events during the study.  NOTE:  receiving coumadin is an exclusion 
criterion and is not permitted on study.
Coumadin or vitamin K antagonists  should not  be administered concomitantly with ibrutinib. 
Supplements such as fish oil and vitamin E preparations should be avoided .  Use ibrutinib with 
caution in subjects requiring other anticoagulants or medications that inhibit platelet function. 
Subjects with congenital bleeding diathesis have not been studied. For subjects requiring the 
initiation of therapeutic anticoagulation therapy (eg, atrial fibrillation), consider the risks and 
benefits of continuing ibrutinib treatment. If therapeutic anticoagulation is clinically indicated, 
treatment with ibrutinib should be held and not be restarted until the subject is clinically stable 
and has no signs of bleeding. Subjects should be observed closely for signs and symptoms of 
bleeding. No dose reduction is required when study drug is restarted..
• No other investigational therapy should be given to patients.  No anticancer agents other 
than 
the study medications administered as part of this study protocol should be given to 
patients.  If such agents are required for a patient, then the patient must first be 
withdrawn from the study.
6 Dose Modifications and Dosing Delays
6.1
Dose Modifications of Ibrutinib for the Immune Response cohort
The following dose modifications of  ibrutinib apply to the subjects who are enrolled in the 
Immune Response cohort only, during the 1 week run-in of ibrutinib only. The dose of study 
drug should be modified according to the dose modification guidelines in Table 4 if any of the 
following toxicities occur: 
Grade 4 ANC (<500/μL) for more than 7 days. See Section 5.6 for instructions regarding 
the 
use of growth factor support. 
Grade 3 thrombocytopenia (<50,000/μL) in the presence of clinically significant bleeding 
events. 
Grade
 4 thrombocytopenia (<25,000/μL). 
Grade 3 or 4 nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea if persistent, despite optimal anti-emetic 
and/or 
anti-diarrheal therapy. 
Any other Grade 4 or unmanageable Grade 3 toxicity.

Fourth Discontinue study drug 
6.2 Dose Modifications for Dose Escalation and Immune Response Cohorts during 
Combination Therapy
Treatment cycles are fixed at 28 days in length.  If neither of the chemotherapies (gemcitabine 
or nab-paclitaxel) can be administered on Day 1 of a new cycle (due to toxicity or any other 
reason), that new cycle will not be considered to start until the day that one or both of the 
chemotherapies is administered to the patient. If the start of a new cycle is postponed due to 
toxicities, the day 1 procedures for that cycle do not need to be repeated at the time of resuming 
treatment, except for any relevant blood tests that caused that cycle to be postponed in the first 
place. 
Missed doses of any/all components of treatment on Days 8, 15 and 22 of a cycle will not be 
made up; i.e., cycle length will not be extended beyond 28 days. Example: On day 15 of a cycle, 
if gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel  are held due to hematologic toxicity, ibrutinib may be given as 
deemed appropriate.  On  Day 22, even if counts have recovered, treatment per protocol on that 
day would consist only of Day 22 ibrutinib; the gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel would not be ‘made 
up’ on that day.  Treatment with all study components would resume on Day 1 of the next cycle.
Brief treatment or visit  delays for public holidays or weather conditions do not constitute a 
protocol violation but should be recorded in CRF.

6.3 Dose Modifications Tables
The following dose modification rules will be used with  respect to potential toxicity.  Toxicity will 
be assessed according to the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 
4.03 (CTCAE v4.03).
Patients experiencing treatment-related  toxicities that require a delay in scheduled dosing for 
>21 days will be discontinued from further study participation. In the event that a drug must be 
held for intolerability (ie neuropathy for nab-paclitaxel or rash for gemcitabine) for more than 21 
days, patients may continue on study receiving the other drugs, including ibrutinib.  Once a dose 
reduction is required at any point, no dose re-escalation will be permitted for the duration of 
study treatment.  For hematologic toxicities, dose adjustments will be made as per Table 5 
below.  
When a dose reduction of ibrutinib is indicated, the treating physician will write an order to 
“decrease ibrutinib
 by one dose reduction”.  The drug should be labeled “first dose reduction” or 
“second dose reduction”. 
6.3.1 Dose Modifications and Schedule for Hematologic Toxicities
Dose level modifications for nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine and ibrutinib where appropriate are 
found 
in Table 4 and 5.  
Grade 3 and 4 anemia will be treated per ASCO and Institutional Guidelines.
Both 
ibrutinib and the  combination of nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine are potentially myelotoxic, 
and because of this overlapping toxicity, it may be difficult for the investigator to determine 
whether hematological toxicity is due to ibrutinib, or the nab-paclitaxel-gemcitabine combination. 
Because of the uncertainty in determining causality, the investigator should assume that any 
hematological toxicity which occurs is due to both ibrutinib and nab-paclitaxel + gemcitabine and 
should follow the recommendations directly below for ibrutinib, and in tables 6 and 7 for nab-
paclitaxel and gemcitabine.
Ibrutinib
Grade 4 ANC (<500/µL) for more than 7 days. See Section 5.6 for instructions regarding 
the 
use of growth factor support. 
Grade ≥3 thrombocytopenia (<50,000/µL)
Hematologic 
dose modifications for  ibrutinib should follow the schedule and dose levels 
recommended in tables 4 and 5.
Nab-Paclitaxel and Gemcitabine
The
 tables below reflect rules for modifying/holding chemotherapy identical to those used in the 
registrational

a G-CSF is optional if descent only affects platelets.  The use of G-CSF should be according to 
Investigator 
preference and institutional standards.  Prophylactic antibiotics are recommended 
in the setting of ANC <1.0 x 109/L.
b If patients do not  experience resolution of neutropenia >21 days, despite uninterrupted G-CSF 
treatment, study treatment will be discontinued.
c Febrile patients (regardless of neutrophil count) should have their chemotherapy treatment 
held.  
A full sepsis diagnostic work-up should be performed while continuing broad spectrum 
antibiotics.  If cultures are positive, the antibiotic may or may not be changed, depending on the 
sensitivity profile of the isolated organism.  Patients with persistent fever after 3 weeks, despite 
uninterrupted antibiotic treatment, will discontinue study treatment.  Febrile neutropenic patients 
can also receive G-CSF, in addition to antibiotic treatment, to hasten the resolution of their 
febrile neutropenia (following current institutional guidelines).  In all cases, ANC must have 
returned to >1500 and platelet count >100,000before resuming chemotherapy treatment.
6.3.2 Dose Modifications  and Schedule for Non-Hematologic Toxicities
Dose level modifications for non-hematologic toxicities for nab-paclitaxel, gemcitibine and 
ibrutinib 
where appropriate are found in Tables 7 and 8.
V4(28SEP2016) Protocol CC#:144525 
Phase I/Immune Response – Ibrutinib Page 41 of 100The start of a new treatment cycle with gemcitabine and/or nab-paclitaxel should not begin until 
any treatment-related 
non-hematologic toxicity has resolved to < Grade 1 or baseline.  In 
general all study drugs will be held.  However, if the investigator determines that the non-
hematologic toxicity was due to one study drug and not the others, treatment with the remaining 
study drugs may continue as clinically appropriate.
Based upon maximum non-hematologic toxicities experienced during the previous cycle, dose 
adjustments for subsequent cycles are to be made according to the following criteria (unless 
specified per unique toxicities as noted below):
Table 8. Day 1 Non-Hematologic Dose Modifications
CTC Grade Gemcitabine Nab-paclitaxel Ibrutinib
0-2 Same as Day 1 previous cycle (except for Grade 2
cutaneous 
toxicity where doses of gemcitabine  and 
nab-paclitaxel should both be reduced to next lower 
dose level)
3a, b, c Hold
Once the AE has been resolved to <Grade 1 or 
baseline, 
reduce by one dose level at the next 
administration
4c Off protocol therapy
a The decision as to which drug (any or all three) should be modified will depend upon the type 
of 
non-hematologic toxicity seen and which course is medically most sound in the judgment of 
the physician/investigator e.g., if the toxicity only affects neuropathy, then only nab-paclitaxel 
should be reduced.
b A pulmonary embolism that is Grade 3 and will be exempt from this requirement at the 
investigator’s 
discretion. 
c Patients who manifest a Grade 3 electrolyte value(s) i.e., hypokalemia, do not require a dose 
reduction 
once the electrolyte issue is resolved.  Patients do not have to be removed from 
protocol for a Grade 4 electrolyte value i.e., Grade 4 elevated glucose in a patient with diabetes 
mellitus.
Dose modifications may also be made for non-hematologic  toxicity occurring WITHIN a cycle, 
as specified below:
Table 9.  Non-Hematologic Dose Modifications within a Cycle (Days 8 and 15)

level at 
the next administration
4dOff protocol therapy
a. Except for cutaneous  toxicity where the dose of Gemcitabine and Nab-paclitaxel should be 
decreased one level.
b. This decision as to which drug (either or both) should be modified will depend upon the type 
of 
non-hematologic toxicity seen and which course is medically most sound in the judgment of 
the physician/investigator.  Once doses are reduced, they should not be re-escalated.
c. A pulmonary embolism that is Grade 3 will be exempt from this requirement at the 
investigator’s discretion.  
d. Patients who manifest a Grade 3 electrolyte value(s) i.e., hypokalemia, do not require a dose 
reduction once the electrolyte issue is resolved.  Patients do not have to be removed from 
protocol for a Grade 4 electrolyte value i.e., Grade 4 elevated glucose in a patient with diabetes 
mellitus.
6.3.2.1 Atrial Fibrillation
For Grade 3 or 4 atrial fibrillation or persistent atrial fibrillation of any grade, consider the risks 
and benefits 
of ibrutinib treatment. If clinically indicated, the use of anticoagulants or antiplatelet 
agents may be considered for the thromboprophylaxis of atrial fibrillation (Section 6.0).  If the 
dose of ibrutinib is reduced, at the investigator’s discretion, the dose of ibrutinib may be re-
escalated after 2 cycles of a dose reduction in the absence of a recurrence of the toxicity that 
led to the reduction. The PI should be consulted before dose reescalation.
6.3.2.2 Peripheral neuropathy
Nab-paclitaxel should be held in patients who experience ≥ Grade 3 peripheral sensory 
neuropathy and may be resumed at the next lower dose level of nab-paclitaxel in subsequent 
cycles after the peripheral neuropathy improves to ≤ Grade 1.  If the toxicity does not resolve 
within 21 days, the patient will be removed from further treatment with nab-paclitaxel and may 
continue treatment with gemcitabine and ibrutinib at the discretion of the care provider, based 
on the clinical status of the patient.  Patients discontinued from study will be followed for 
progression-free survival.
6.3.2.3 Hypersensitivity Reactions
Hypersensitivity
 reactions are graded  as follows:
• Grade 1:  Mild transient reaction; infusion interruption not indicated; intervention not 
indicated. 
• Grade 2:  Therapy or infusion interruption indicated but responds promptly to 
symptomatic treatment (e.g., antihistamines, NSAIDS, narcotics, IV fluids indicated for 
≤24 hours). 
• Grade 3:  Prolonged (e.g., not rapidly responsive to symptomatic medication and/or brief 
interruption of infusion); recurrence of symptoms following initial improvement; 
hospitalization indicated for other clinical sequelae.  Note: any infusion that is interrupted 
and not resumed within the visit will be considered a Grade 3 reaction.
V4(28SEP2016) Protocol CC#:144525 
Phase I/Immune Response – Ibrutinib Page 43 of 100• Grade 4:  Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated. 
Hypersensitivity reactions are not  expected with either gemcitabine or nab-paclitaxel or ibrutinib, 
and, if they do occur, are generally minor.  However, in rare instances, more severe reactions 
may occur.  A patient who experiences a Grade 3 infusion reaction may either be taken off 
study protocol at the discretion of the treating physician or be rechallenged at one dose level 
lower.  A patient who experiences a Grade 4 infusion reaction should be taken off study 
protocol.
6.3.2.4 Hepatic toxicity
Ibrutinib
 is metabolized in the liver. For subjects who develop mild liver impairment while on 
study 
(Child-Pugh class A), the recommended dose reduction for ibrutinib is to a level of 280 mg 
daily (two capsules). For subjects who develop moderate liver impairment (Child-Pugh class B), 
the recommended dose reduction is to a level of 140 mg daily (one capsule). Subjects who 
develop severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C) must hold study drug until resolved to 
moderate impairment (Child-Pugh class B) or better, and could be re-treated according to  
resolved hepatic conditions (ie, 140 mg or 280 mg for moderate or mild.)

one dose level lower once total bilirubin 
resolves to Grade ≤1 and AST/ALT to 
Grade ≤2.
Grade 4 (>20x 
ULN)OR Grade 4 (>10x ULN) Remove from study treatment
Note: If elevated liver function tests (LFTs) are related to biliary obstruction and are corrected 
after 
appropriate intervention (e.g. stenting), no dose reductions are required.
6.3.2.5 Cutaneous Toxicity
Patients
 who develop Grade  2 or 3 cutaneous toxicity should have their dose reduced to the 
next lower dose level for nab-pa.  If the patient continues to experience Grade 2 or 3 reactions, 
V4(28SEP2016) Protocol CC#:144525 
Phase I/Immune Response – Ibrutinib Page 44 of 100despite dose reduction, treatment  should be discontinued.  Patients who develop Grade 4 
cutaneous toxicity should have treatment discontinued.
6.3.2.6 Pulmonary Embolism
A
 patient with a grade 3 pulmonary embolism can remain in therapy despite need for 
anticoagulation.  
Low molecular weight (LMW) heparin may be used as an anticoagulant for 
thromboembolic events during the study.  NOTE:  Coumadin treatment is not allowed during the 
study.
6.3.2.7 Nausea/Vomiting/Diarrhea
For nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea  that are attributed to one or more of the study drugs, 
maximal medical management should be employed prior to dose reductions.  If the toxicities 
persist at Grade 3 or greater despite optimal medical management, then appropriate dose holds 
and reductions should be performed.

Patients who discontinue study  treatment prior to the occurrence of disease progression will be 
followed approximately every 8 weeks in the same modality from the date of last dose of 
ibrutinib, gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel until disease progression or for up to 2 years 
whichever comes first.  Assessments at these visits will be performed as described in Tables 11 
and 12.  Any subsequent cancer therapy will be documented.
7.7.2 Survival Follow-up
Following documented disease progression,  patients will be followed every 2 months for 2 years 
for subsequent anticancer therapy, secondary malignancies, and survival status.  Information on 
the start date, type and duration of any subsequent anticancer therapy will be collected.  This 
follow-up may be accomplished through routine clinic follow up visits, documented telephone 
contact with the patient or through contact with the primary practitioner or caregiver.

8.1.2 Dose
 and Administration
Ibrutinib
 (92ct, 140-mg capsules for 280, 420, 840 mgs and 120ct, 140-mg capsules for 
560mgs) is administered orally once daily. The capsules are to be taken around the same time 
each day with 8 ounces (approximately 240 mL) of water.  The capsules should be swallowed 
intact and patients should not attempt to open capsules or dissolve them in water. The use of 
strong CYP3A inhibitors/inducers, and grapefruit and Seville oranges should be avoided for the 
duration of the study (Appendix 8).
If a dose is not taken at the scheduled time, it can be taken as soon as possible on the same 
day with 
a return to the normal schedule the following day.  The patient should not take extra 
capsules to make up the missed dose.
The first dose will be delivered in the clinic on Day 1, after which subsequent dosing is typically 
on an outpatient 
basis.  Ibrutinib will be dispensed to patients in bottles at each visit.  Unused 
ibrutinib dispensed during previous visits must be returned to the site and drug accountability 
records (Section 8.1.3) updated at each visit.  Returned capsules must not be redispensed to 
anyone.
8.1.3 Accountability
The pharmacist(s) must  confirm the quantity of ibrutinib received with each shipment.  The 
Investigator or designee will maintain records to confirm that the product was stored at 15-30°C, 
product delivery to the trial site, product inventory at the site, the dose given to each patient, and 
the destruction of unused vials.  .
V4(28SEP2016) Protocol CC#:144525 
Phase I/Immune Response – Ibrutinib Page 49 of 1008.1.4 Precautions and Risks
Overdose
Any dose of study drug in excess of that specified in this protocol is considered to be an 
overdose.  
Signs and symptoms of an overdose that meet any Serious Adverse Event criterion 
must be reported as a Serious Adverse Event in the appropriate time frame and documented as 
clinical sequelae to an overdose. 
There is no specific experience in the management of ibrutinib overdose in patients. No 
maximum tolerated 
dose (MTD) was reached in the Phase 1 study in which subjects received 
up to 12.5 mg/kg/day (1400 mg/day). Healthy subjects were exposed up to single dose of 1680 
mg. One healthy subject experienced reversible Grade 4 hepatic enzyme increases (AST and 
ALT) after a dose of 1680 mg. Subjects who ingested more than the recommended dosage 
should be closely monitored and given appropriate." supportive treatment.There is no specific 
antidote for ibrutinib.  In the event of an overdose, subjects should be closely monitored and 
given appropriate supportive treatment.
Refer to Section 11 for further information regarding AE reporting.

8.2 Gemcitabine
Gemcitabine (2’-Deoxy-2’, 2’-difluorocytidine  monohydrochloride, Gemzar) exhibits cell phase 
specificity, primarily killing cells undergoing DNA synthesis (S phase) and also blocking the 
progression of cells through the G1/S phase boundary.  Gemcitabine is metabolized 
intracellularly by nucleoside kinases to the active diphosphate (dFdCDP) and triphosphate 
V4(28SEP2016) Protocol CC#:144525 
Phase I/Immune Response – Ibrutinib Page 51 of 100(dFdCTP) nucleosides.  The  cytotoxic effect of gemcitabine is attributed to a combination of two 
actions of the diphosphate and the triphosphate nucleosides, which leads to inhibition of DNA 
synthesis.  First, gemcitabine diphosphate inhibits ribonucleotide reductase, which is 
responsible for catalyzing the reactions that generate the deoxynucleoside triphosphates for 
DNA synthesis.  Inhibition of this enzyme by the diphosphate nucleoside causes a reduction in 
the concentrations of deoxynucleotides, including dCTP.  Second, gemcitabine triphosphate 
competes with dCTP for incorporation into DNA.  The reduction in the intracellular concentration 
of dCTP (by the action of the diphosphate) enhances the incorporation of gemcitabine 
triphosphate into DNA (self-potentiation).  After the gemcitabine nucleotide is incorporated into 
DNA, only one additional nucleotide is added to the growing DNA strands.  After this addition, 
there is inhibition of further DNA synthesis.  DNA polymerase epsilon is unable to remove the 
gemcitabine nucleotide and repair the growing DNA strands (masked chain termination).  In 
CEM T lymphoblastoid cells, gemcitabine induces internucleosomal DNA fragmentation, one of 
the characteristics of programmed cell death.
8.2.1 Drug Storage and Stability
Gemcitabine
 is commercially available in 200 mg and 1 gm vials and will be obtained from 
commercial supply.  Gemcitabine should be prepared as per institutional standards.
8.2.2 Drug Administration
Gemcitabine should be prepared as per institutional standards.
8.2.3 Side Effects
Most
 common side effects include myelosuppresion, rash, nausea/vomiting, fever, fatigue, flu-
like symptoms, fluid retention, diarrhea, and transaminitis.  Rare but serious side effects include 
pulmonary syndromes, bronchospasm, and hemolytic-uremic syndrome.  For more information 
please see the prescribing information.
8.3 Nab-paclitaxel (Abraxane)
Abraxane
 (nab-paclitaxel, nanoparticle albumin-bound  paclitaxel), when released as the active 
drug (paclitaxel), blocks cell replication in the G2 mitotic phase by promoting microtubule 
assembly, stabilizing existing microtubules, and inhibiting disassembly of microtubles.  Binding 
of abraxane by an albumin specific receptor (gp60) leads to activation of caveolin-1, a protein 
which mediates internalization of the compound into the endothelial cell and transport to the 
tumor interstitium.  Secreted Protein And Rich in Cysteine (SPARC), a tumor-secreted protein, 
binds albumin, releasing the active drug at the tumor cell membrane, thereby increasing its 
concentration at the target site of action.

drug (paclitaxel), blocks cell replication in the G2 mitotic phase by promoting microtubule 
assembly, stabilizing existing microtubules, and inhibiting disassembly of microtubles.  Binding 
of abraxane by an albumin specific receptor (gp60) leads to activation of caveolin-1, a protein 
which mediates internalization of the compound into the endothelial cell and transport to the 
tumor interstitium.  Secreted Protein And Rich in Cysteine (SPARC), a tumor-secreted protein, 
binds albumin, releasing the active drug at the tumor cell membrane, thereby increasing its 
concentration at the target site of action.

9 Response Evaluations And Measurements
All patients with measurable disease will be evaluated for response using the RECIST version 
1.1 
(Appendix 4) (Eisenhauer et al. 2009).
10 Statistical Considerations
10.1
Study Design
This
 is a phase Ib/Immune Response study of ibrutinib in combination with nab-paclitaxel and 
gemcitabine 
in the management of patients with metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma.  Phase 
Ib is a standard dose-confirmation schema with 3 to 6 patients per cohort (3+3 dose 
escalation/de-escalation design). There are two planned dose cohorts, with two additional 
cohorts at de-escalated doses if necessary. The objective of the part Ib is to confirm the safety 
and toxicity of the combination of gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel with the doses and schedule 
of ibrutinib previously shown to be safe and effective in the management of patients with CLL 
and Mantle Cell Lymphoma,and to determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD),. See section 
5.0 and section 5.1 for more details. At least six patients total will have received the MTD to 
verify and confirm the safety and toxicity of ibrutinib in combination with nab-paclitaxel and 
gemcitabine in patients with metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma. These 6 patients will also 
be followed for overall survival and included in efficacy and clinical benefit analysis of the study.
The 20 patients enrolled and treated in the Immune Response study cohort will be evaluated for 
safety 
and followed for survival.

Not Applicable
10.6 Stratification
Not applicable
10.7 Missing Data and Replacement Policy
Data for all patients will be summarized and analyzed to the extent the available data allow.  
Missing data 
will not be imputed or replaced.
10.8 Interim Analyses and Stopping Rules
Not applicable for phase Ib  study design. Stopping rules are already included as part of 
standard 3+3 design.
10.9 Analyses Plans
Descriptive
 statistics will  be used to summarize baseline subject characteristics, treatment 
administration, efficacy, and safety outcomes.  Summaries of discrete data will include number 
of subjects and incidence as a frequency and as a percentage.  Summaries of continuous data 
will include mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, maximum, and sample size.
10.10 Primary Analysis (or Analysis of Primary Endpoints)
Phase Ib: Safety will  be assessed through summaries of DLTs and other adverse events.  
Tolerability will be described using summaries of dose reductions, dose delays, discontinuations 
for toxicity, and overall dose exposure. The safety of the MTD will be established after review by 
V4(28SEP2016) Protocol CC#:144525 
Phase I/Immune Response – Ibrutinib Page 54 of 100the Study Team (comprised of Principal Investigator, Investigational Pharmacist, Study 
Statistician, and Site Committee quorum) taking into account the the severity and causal 
relationship for all DLTs and other AEs, and tolerability.  Review of PD parameters at each dose 
level may also be used to inform determination of MTD. Eligible patients who receive at least 
one dose of the study drug are evaluable for safety from the date and time of their first dose of 
the study drug until 30 days after last dose of study drug.
10.11 Secondary Analysis (or  Analysis of Secondary Endpoints)
Kaplan-Meier methods will be used to  summarize median TTP, PFS, and OS with 95% 
confidence intervals.  The proportion of patients with TTP and PFS equal to or exceeding 6 
months will also be calculated and reported along with 95% confidence intervals.
CA19-9 Response Rate
The
 CA19-9 Response  Rate is defined as the percentage of CA 19-9 evaluable treated patients 
(baseline CA19-9 > 75 units) who have confirmed CA19-9 reduction of 75% from baseline 
value. Patients who have missing CA19-9 measurements will be treated as non-responders, 
i.e., they will be included in the denominator when calculating the percentage. The CA19-9 
Response Rate, along with exact one-sided 95% confidence intervals, will be reported for the 
study.
Time to Progression (TTP)
TTP 
is defined as the duration from date of first dose of protocol therapy to date of removal from 
study 
for radiographic (per RECIST 1.1) and/or clinical progression including death attributed to 
progression. Eligible patients are evaluable for TTP who are response-evaluable and who are 
removed from study for radiographic or clinical progression.  For patients removed from study 
for other reasons (such as for toxicity, withdrawal of consent, death without documented 
progression, or other reasons without clinical or radiographic evidence of tumor progression), 
TTP will be censored at the date of study discontinuation. 
Progression-Free Survival (PFS)
PFS
 is defined as the  duration of time from date of first dose of protocol therapy to time of 
documented radiographic and/or clinical disease progression or death from any cause. Eligible 
patients are evaluable for PFS who are response-evaluable and who are removed from study 
for radiographic or clinical progression and/or who experience death from any cause during 
study follow up.  Patients who have not progressed or died are censored at the date last known 
to be progression-free.  
Overall Survival (OS)
Median 
OS for  all enrolled patients will be calculated from date of first dose of protocol therapy 
until date of death, using chart review and/or follow up phone calls to determine date of death in 
patients after removal from study.  The survival of patients still alive after 2 years of follow up 
post study discontinuation will be censored.  Alive patients are censored at the date last known 
alive
10.12 Analyses of  Exploratory Endpoints
Identification of myeloid  cell biomarkers by flow cytometry : FACS will be used to 
V4(28SEP2016) Protocol CC#:144525 
Phase I/Immune Response – Ibrutinib Page 55 of 100quantitatively evaluate abundance, complexity, phenotype and functional  status of myeloid cells 
(TH1, T H2, T H17) using blood leukocytes from patients. Multiplex ELISA and RT-PCT will be used 
to assess a broad spectrum of T H cell responses in peripheral blood leukocytes. These 
parameters will be compared to expression levels of biomarkers and cytokines in frozen and/or 
FFPE-embedded tumor tissue from pre- and post-treatment PDA patients vs. archived PDA and 
normal pancreas tissues. Globin mRNA will be extracted using anti-globin magnetic beads prior 
to multiplex PCR analysis.
T cell frequency, clonality and function
Polychromatic flow cytometry:   Abundance, complexity, phenotype and functional status of T 
cells in peripheral blood leukocytes and tumor cell suspensions will be analyzed by FACS 
quantitation of Ag-specific CD8+ T cells in using peptide epitope-MHC class I tetramers. 
Tetramer+ and (-) CD8+ T cells will be stained for accepted markers reporting functional status 
of Ag-specific CD8+ T cells, the proliferation Ki-67, and the cellular activation markers. 
T cell frequency and function:  In addition to FACS, the EPIMAX platform will be used, allowing 
assessment of a broad spectrum of T cell responses both by epitope mapping and by cytokine 
profiling[33, 34] (e.g., TNFα, IFNγ, IL2, IL4, IL10, IL17) using 9-10mer (CD8+ T cells) or 20mer 
libraries (CD4+ T cells). Morisita’s distances will be calculated for serial blood and tumor 
samples
TCR deep sequencing of tissue and blood:  T  cell responses, their clonality, and expansion or 
contraction over time will be monitored globally by deep sequencing of TCRβ chains to identify 
and track unique T cell clones in tissue and blood. 
Changes in Circulating and Intra-tumoral B-Cell Receptors
B cell frequency and phenotype: B cell abundance, complexity, phenotype and functional status 
of B cells will be quantitatively evaluated by FACS analysis of blood leukocytes and tumor cell 
suspensions before and after therapy with ibrutinib-only.  
BCR sequencing: Immuno-receptor  loci rearrangements from genomic DNA samples reflecting 
pre- vs. post-treatment PB and tumor will be sequenced using V and J segment consensus 
primers. Sequences will be analyzed using standardized algorithms for clonotype determination. 
Clonotype identification and enumeration:  The frequency of each clonotype in a sample will be 
determined by calculating the number of sequencing reads for each clonotype divided by the 
total number of passed sequencing reads in the sample, with algorithmic methods utilized for 
clonotype determination as described previously. Low quality reads, those that do not map to a 
J and a V segment and do not demonstrate high-quality sequence data in the clone-defining 
region, will be excluded. Sequence data will be analyzed to determine clonotype sequences 
including mapping to germline V and J consensus sequences. 
Determination of repertoire diversity and repertoire  change: Diversity of individual sample 
repertoires will be assessed by calculating the number of unique clonotypes comprising the top 
25th % of cumulative reads after sorting by clone abundance. Repertoire change between 
sequential experiments will be measured using Morisita’s distance, which is not significantly 
V4(28SEP2016) Protocol CC#:144525 
Phase I/Immune Response – Ibrutinib Page 56 of 100influenced by sample size1, 2, and reported as a continuous variable from 0-1 with1 indicating 
maximal dissimilarity.
Statistical Analysis
Analyses for diversity, repertoire  change and identification of differentially abundant clonotypes 
will be performed as described above. In the Immune Response Study, 20 patients will be 
enrolled and their B and T cell repertoires measured at time points, including pre-, post-, start of, 
during, and end of treatment. Changes in B and T cell repertoire parameters over time will be 
modeled using mixed effects models to account for an intra-subject correlation. A binary and 
ordinal logistic regression analyses will be performed to evaluate effect of pre-treatment B and T 
cell repertoire parameters on tumor response (PD, SD, PR, CR), while Cox regression analysis 
will be performed to evaluate their impacts on disease free survival. Due to the limited sample 
size, multivariate analyses will be primarily exploratory, and include an examination of the joint 
effects of several B and T cell repertoires parameters on the clinical outcome. 
10.13 Evaluation of Safety
Analyses will be performed for  all patients having received at least one dose of study drug.  The 
study will use the NCI CTCAE v4.03.
11 Safety Reporting And Analyses
Timely, 
accurate, and complete  reporting and analysis of safety information from clinical studies 
are crucial for the protection of subjects, investigators, and the sponsor, and are mandated by 
regulatory agencies worldwide.
Investigators must report SAEs and follow-up information to their responsible Institutional 
Review Board (IRB) according to the policies of the responsible IRB.
11.1 Adverse Events 
The
 Principal Investigator  is responsible for recognizing and reporting AEs.  It is the Principal 
Investigator’s responsibility to report relevant SAEs to the applicable local and national 
regulatory bodies.
Definitions of Adverse Events
An
 AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient administered a pharmaceutical product 
and which does not
 necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment.  An AE can 
therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including a clinically significant abnormal 
laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of an 
investigational study drug, whether or not considered related to the study drug (ICH-E2A, 1995).
For the purposes of this clinical study, AEs include events which are either new or represent 
detectable 
exacerbations of pre-existing conditions.
V4(28SEP2016) Protocol CC#:144525 
Phase I/Immune Response – Ibrutinib Page 57 of 100The term “disease progression” should not be reported as an adverse event term.  As an 
example, 
"worsening of underlying disease" or the clinical diagnosis that is associated with 
disease progression should be reported.
Adverse events may include,  but are not limited to:
• Subjective or objective  symptoms provided by the patient and/or observed by the 
Investigator or study staff including laboratory abnormalities of clinical significance.
• Any AEs experienced by the patient through the completion of final study procedures.
• AEs
 not  previously observed in the patient that emerge during the protocol-specified AE 
reporting period, including signs or symptoms associated with the underlying disease 
that were not present before the AE reporting period 
• Complications that  occur as a result of protocol-mandated interventions (eg, invasive 
procedures such as biopsies).
The following are NOT considered AEs :
• Pre-existing condition:   A pre-existing condition (documented on the medical history 
CRF) is not considered an AE unless the severity, frequency, or character of the event 
worsens during the study period.
• Pre-planned or elective  hospitalization:  A hospitalization planned before signing the 
informed consent form is not considered an SAE, but rather a therapeutic intervention.  
However, if during the pre-planned hospitalization an event occurs, which prolongs the 
hospitalization or meets any other SAE criteria, the event will be considered an SAE.  
Surgeries or interventions that were under consideration, but not performed before 
enrollment in the study, will not be considered serious if they are performed after 
enrollment in the study for a condition that has not changed from its baseline level.  
Elective hospitalizations for social reasons, solely for the administration of 
chemotherapy, or due to long travel distances are also not SAEs.
• Diagnostic Testing  and Procedures:  Testing and procedures should not to be reported 
as AEs or SAEs, but rather the cause for the test or procedure should be reported.
Recording and Reporting of Adverse Events
All AEs of any subject during the course of the study will be recorded in the CRF, and the 
investigator 
will give his or her opinion as to the relationship of the AE to the study drug 
treatment (i.e., whether the event is related or unrelated to study drug administration).  
All AEs should be documented.  A description of the event, including its date of onset and 
resolution, 
whether it constitutes an SAE or not, any action taken (e.g., changes to study 
treatment), and outcome, should be provided, along with the investigator’s assessment of 
causality (i.e., the relationship to the study treatment[s]).  For an AE to be a suspected 
treatment-related event there should be at least a reasonable possibility of a causal relationship 
V4(28SEP2016) Protocol CC#:144525 
Phase I/Immune Response – Ibrutinib Page 58 of 100between the protocol  treatment and the AE.  Adverse events will be graded according to the 
NCI CTCAE 4.03.   
If the AE is serious, it should be reported immediately to IRB of record.  Other untoward events 
occurring in the
 framework of a clinical study are also to be recorded as AEs (i.e., AEs that 
occur prior to assignment of study treatment that are related to a study-mandated intervention, 
including invasive procedures such as biopsies, medication washout, or no treatment run-in).
Any clinically significant signs and symptoms; abnormal test findings;  changes in physical 
examination; hypersensitivity; and other measurements that occur will be reported as an AE, 
and collected on the relevant CRF.
Test findings will be reported  as an AE if the test result requires an adjustment in the study 
drug(s) or discontinuation of treatment; and/ or test findings require additional testing, treatment, 
or surgical intervention; a test result or finding is associated with accompanying symptoms; or a 
test result is considered to be an AE by the investigator.
All AEs regardless of seriousness or relationship to study treatment, spanning from the start of 
study 
treatment, until 30 calendar days after discontinuation or completion of study treatment as 
defined by the clinical study for that subject, are to be recorded in the CRF.  
Handling of Adverse Events
All AEs resulting in discontinuation from the trial should be followed until resolution or 
stabilization.  
Patients must be followed for AEs for 30 calendar days after discontinuation or 
completion of clinical trial-specific treatment (e.g., chemotherapy, radiation, oral medications, 
targeted therapy, and surgery).  All new AEs occurring during this period must be reported and 
followed until resolution unless, in the opinion of the investigator, the AE or laboratory 
abnormality/ies are not likely to improve because of the underlying disease.  In this case, the 
investigators must record his or her reasoning for this decision in the subject’s medical record 
and as a comment on the CRF.  After 30 days of completion of study-specific treatment or 
discontinuation, only AEs, SAEs, or deaths assessed by the investigator as treatment related 
are to be reported.
11.2 Serious Adverse Events 
Definitions of Serious Adverse Events  
The definitions of SAEs are given below.   The Principal Investigator is responsible for ensuring 
that all staff involved in the trial is familiar with the content of this section.
A serious adverse event based on ICH and EU Guidelines on Pharmacovigilance for Medicinal 
Products for Human Use is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose that:
Results in death
Is a life-threatening adverse event. Life-threatening is defined as an AE in which the 
patient 
was at risk of death at the time of the event.  It does not refer to an event which 
hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe.  If either the Investigator 
or the IND Sponsor believes that an AE meets the definition of life-threatening, it will be 
considered life threatening.
V4(28SEP2016) Protocol CC#:144525 
Phase I/Immune Response – Ibrutinib Page 59 of 100Requires at least  a 24-hour inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing 
hospitalization 
Results in persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to 
conduct 
normal life functions 
Results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect.
Is an important medical event that may not result in death, be immediately life 
threatening 
or require hospitalization, but may be considered an SAE when, based upon 
appropriate medical judgment, the event may jeopardize the patient or patient may 
require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in this definition.  
Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency department or at 
home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias, or convulsion that does not result in 
hospitalization; or development of drug dependency or drug abuse.
Treatment within or admission to the following facilities is not considered to meet the criteria of 
“inpatient hospitalization” (although if any other SAE criteria are met, the event must still be 
treated as an SAE and immediately reported):
• Emergency Department  or Emergency Room
• Outpatient or same-day surgery units
•
Observation or short-stay  unit
• Rehabilitation facility
•
Hospice or skilled  nursing facility
• Nursing homes,  custodial care or respite care facility
Hospitalization during the  trial for a pre-planned surgical or medical procedure (one which was 
planned prior to entry in the trial) does not require reporting as an SAE to the local IRB. Deaths 
that are attributed by the Investigator solely to the progression of disease do not require 
reporting as an SAE to the the local IRB.
Serious Adverse Event Reporting by Investigators
It is important to distinguish between “serious” and “severe” adverse events, as the terms are 
not 
synonymous.  Severity is a measure of intensity; however, an AE of severe intensity need 
not necessarily be considered serious.  For example, nausea which persists for several hours 
may be considered severe nausea, but may not be considered an SAE.  On the other hand, a 
stroke which results in only a limited degree of disability may be considered only a mild stroke, 
but would be considered an SAE.  Severity and seriousness should be independently assessed 
when recording AEs on the CRF and SAEs on the SAE Report Form.
Adverse events classified  by the treating investigator as serious require expeditious handling 
and reporting to the sponsor in order to comply with regulatory requirements.  Serious adverse 
events may occur at any time from the start of study treatment through the 30-day follow-up 
period after the last study treatment.  The sponsor must be notified of all SAEs, regardless of 
V4(28SEP2016) Protocol CC#:144525 
Phase I/Immune Response –  Ibrutinib Page 60 of 100causality, within one business day of the first knowledge of the event by the treating physician or 
research personnel.  
To report an SAE, the SAE Report Form should be completed with the necessary information.  
All SAEs occurring from the start of study treatment, until 30 calendar 
days of last study 
treatment must be reported to the chair, Dr. Margaret Tempero as SAEs on the SAE Report 
Form and followed until resolution (with autopsy report if applicable).
Deaths and other SAEs occurring >30 calendar days after last study treatment that are deemed 
‘possibly’ or ‘probably’ related to study drug must be reported as SAEs on the SAE Report Form 
within 1 day of first knowledge of the event by the treating physician or research personnel (with 
an autopsy report if available).
Deaths occurring >30 calendar days after last study treatment and not attributed to study 
treatment (e.g., disease 
progression) need not be reported as SAEs, but simply captured on the 
appropriate CRF.
To report an SAE, the SAE Report Form should be completed with the necessary information.
The SAE 
report Form should be sent to the study coordination site via e-mail using the following 
contact information (during 
both business and non-business hours):  
  
  
  
Emailof the 
SAE report Form should be confirmed by the site personnel submitting the report.
Reporting to Regulatory Agencies:
Serious adverse 
events will be forwarded to FDA by the IND Sponsor according to 21 CFR 
312.32.
It is the responsibility of the Investigator and the research team to ensure that serious adverse 
events are reported according to the Code
 of Federal Regulations, Good Clinical Practices 
(GCP), the protocol guidelines, the sponsor’s guidelines, and Institutional Review Board policy.
Severity Criteria (Grade 1-5)
Definitions 
found in the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version  4.03 (CTCAE 
v4.03) will be used for grading the severity (intensity) of nonhematologic AEs.  Refer to 
http://evs.nci.nih.gov/ftp1/CTCAE/About.html  for the grading of hematologic AEs.  The CTCAE 
v4.0 displays Grades 1 through 5 with unique clinical descriptions of severity for each 
referenced AE.  Should a patient experience any AE not listed in the CTCAE v4.03, the 
following grading system should be used to assess severity:

V4(28SEP2016) Protocol CC#:144525 
Phase I/Immune Response – Ibrutinib Page 61 of 100• Grade 1 (Mild AE)  – experiences which are usually transient, requiring no special 
treatment, and not interfering with the patient’s daily activities
• Grade 2 (Moderate  AE) – experiences which introduce some level of inconvenience or 
concern to the patient, and which may interfere with daily activities, but are usually 
ameliorated by simple therapeutic measures
• Grade 3 (Severe  AE) – experiences which are unacceptable or intolerable, significantly 
interrupt the patient’s usual daily activity, and require systemic drug therapy or other 
treatment
• Grade 4 (Life-threatening  or disabling AE) – experiences which cause the patient to be 
in imminent danger of death
• Grade 5 (Death  related to AE) – experiences which result in patient death
Causality (Attribution) 
The 
Investigator is to assess the causal relation  (ie, whether there is a reasonable possibility 
that the study drug caused the event) using the following definitions:
Not Related: Another cause of  the AE is more plausible; a temporal sequence cannot be 
established with the onset of the AE and administration of the investigational product; or, a 
causal relationship is considered biologically implausible.
Unlikely: The current  knowledge or information about the AE indicates that a relationship 
to the investigational product is unlikely.
Possibly Related: There is a clinically plausible time sequence between onset of the AE and 
administration of the investigational product, but the AE could also be attributed to concurrent or 
underlying disease, or the use of other drugs or procedures.  Possibly related should be used 
when the investigational product is one of several biologically plausible AE causes.
Related: The AE  is clearly related to use of the investigational product.
Unexpected Adverse Events
An
 “unexpected” AE is an AE  that is not listed in the Investigator's Brochure/package insert or is 
not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed.  For example, hepatic necrosis 
would be “unexpected” (by virtue of greater severity) if the Investigator's Brochure referred only 
to elevated hepatic enzymes or hepatitis.  Similarly, cerebral thromboembolism and cerebral 
vasculitis would be “unexpected” (by virtue of greater specificity) if the Investigator's 
Brochure/package insert listed only cerebral vascular accidents.  "Unexpected" also refers to 
AEs that are mentioned in the Investigator's Brochure as occurring with a class of drugs or as 
anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the drug, but are not specifically mentioned 
as occurring with the study drug under investigation.
Documenting and Reporting of Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events by 
Investigators
V4(28SEP2016) Protocol CC#:144525 
Phase I/Immune Response – Ibrutinib Page 62 of 100Assessment of Adverse Events
Investigators
 will assess the occurrence of adverse events and serious adverse events at all 
subject evaluation time points during the study. All adverse events and serious adverse events 
whether volunteered by the subject, discovered by study personnel during questioning, detected 
through physical examination, clinically significant laboratory test, or other means, will be 
recorded.  Each recorded adverse event or serious adverse event will be described by its 
duration (ie, start and end dates), severity, regulatory seriousness criteria (if applicable), 
suspected relationship to the investigational product, and any actions taken.
Adverse Event Reporting Period
All AEs whether serious or non-serious, will be captured from the time signed and dated ICF is 
obtained 
until 30 days following the last dose of study drug. 
Serious adverse events reported after 30 days following the last dose of study drug should also 
be reported if considered related to study drug. Resolution information after 30 days should be 
provided. 
Progressive disease should NOT  be reported as an event term, but instead symptoms/clinical 
signs of disease progression may be reported. (See Section 11.1.1)
All adverse events, regardless of seriousness, severity, or presumed relationship to study drug, 
must 
be recorded using medical terminology in the source document. All records will need to 
capture the details of the duration and the severity of each episode, the action taken with 
respect to the study drug, investigator’s evaluation of its relationship to the study drug, and the 
event outcome. Whenever possible, diagnoses should be given when signs and symptoms are 
due to a common etiology (eg, cough, runny nose, sneezing, sore throat, and head congestion 
should be reported as "upper respiratory infection"). 
All deaths should be reported with the primary cause of death as the AE term, as death is 
typically 
the outcome of the event, not the event itself. 
If a death occurs within 30 days after the last dose of study drug, the death must be reported as 
a serious adverse event. 
Pregnancy
Before
 study enrollment,  subjects must agree to take appropriate measures to avoid pregnancy. 
However, should a pregnancy occur in a female study subject, consent to provide follow-up 
information regarding the outcome of the pregnancy and the health of the infant until 30 days 
old will be requested.
A female subject must  immediately inform the Investigator if she becomes pregnant from the 
time of consent to 30 days after the last dose of study drug. A male subject must immediately 
inform the Investigator if his partner becomes pregnant from the time of consent to 3 months 
after the last dose of study drug. Any female subjects receiving study drug(s) who become 
pregnant must immediately discontinue study drug. The Investigator should counsel the subject, 
discussing any risks of continuing the pregnancy and any possible effects on the fetus.  
V4(28SEP2016) Protocol CC#:144525 
Phase I/Immune Response – Ibrutinib Page 63 of 100Although pregnancy itself  is not regarded as an adverse event, the outcome will need to be 
documented. Any pregnancy occurring in a subject or subject’s partner from the time of consent 
to 30 days after the last dose of study drug must be reported. Any occurrence of pregnancy 
must be reported to Pharmacyclics Drug Safety, or designee, per SAE reporting timelines. All 
pregnancies will be followed for outcome, which is defined as elective termination of the 
pregnancy, miscarriage, or delivery of the fetus. For pregnancies with an outcome of live birth, 
the newborn infant will be followed until 30 days old and this must be reported to Pharmacyclics 
Drug Safety, or designee, per SAE reporting timelines. Any congenital anomaly/birth defect 
noted in the infant must be reported as a serious adverse event.
Non-melanoma Skin Cancer and Other Malignancies
Non-melanoma skin cancer (basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma of the skin) 
have been reported with more frequency and may be related to the use of ibrutinib.  Other 
cancers have been been reported such as solid tumors and hematologic malignancies, and will 
be reported for the duration of study treatment and during any protocol-specified follow-up 
periods including post-progression follow-up for overall survival.
Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESI)
Specific adverse events, or groups of adverse events, will be followed as part of standard safety 
monitoring activities. These events (regardless of seriousness) will be reported to the local IRB 
per the SAE reporting timelines.  
Major Hemorrhage
Major hemorrhage is defined  as any of the following:
• Any treatment-emergent hemorrhagic adverse events of Grade 3 or higher*. Any 
treatment-emergent 
serious adverse events of bleeding of any grade
• Any treatment-emergent central nervous system hemorrhage/hematoma of any grade
*All 
hemorrhagic events requiring transfusion of red blood cells should be reported as grade 3 or 
higher AE per CTCAE v4.02.
Events meeting the definition  of major hemorrhage will be captured as an event of special 
interest according to above.
Expediting Reporting Requirements for Serious Adverse Events
All serious adverse events and AESIs (initial and follow-up information) will be reported on FDA 
Medwatch (Form 3500A) or Suspect Adverse Event Report (CIOMS Form 1) IRB Reporting 
Form and sent sent via email (AEintakePM@pcyc.com) or fax ((408) 215-3500), to 
Pharmacyclics Drug Safety, or designee, within 24 hrs of the event. Pharmacyclics may request 
follow-up and other additional information from the Sponsor Investigator. 
All serious adverse events that have not resolved by the end of the study, or that have not 
resolved upon discontinuation of the subject's participation in the study, must be followed until 
any of the following occurs:

11.3 Usage of  Concurrent/Concomitant Medications
11.3.1 Medications to  be Used With Caution
CYP3A- Inhibitors/Inducers
Ibrutinib is metabolized primarily by CYP3A. Avoid co-administration with strong or moderate 
CYP3A 
inhibitors and consider alternative agents with less CYP3A inhibition. 
If a strong CYP3A inhibitor (eg, ketoconazole, indinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, 
clarithromycin, 
telithromycin, itraconazole, nefazadone, or cobicistat) must be used, 
reduce ibrutinib dose to 140 mg or withhold treatment for the duration of inhibitor use. 
Subjects should be monitored for signs of ibrutinib toxicity. 
If a moderate CYP3A inhibitor (eg, voriconazole, erythromycin, amprenavir, aprepitant, 
atazanavir, 
ciprofloxacin, crizotinib, darunavir/ritonavir, diltiazem, fluconazole, 
fosamprenavir, imatinib, verapamil, amiodarone, or dronedarone) must be used, reduce 
ibrutinib to 140 mg (for 840 mg/day dose, reduce to 280 mg) for the duration of the 
inhibitor use. Avoid grapefruit and Seville oranges during ibrutinib/placebo treatment, as 
these contain moderate inhibitors of CYP3A (see Section 5.3.1.2).
No dose adjustment is required in combination with mild inhibitors. 
Avoid 
concomitant use of  strong CYP3A inducers (eg, carbamazepine, rifampin, phenytoin, and 
St. John’s Wort). Consider alternative agents with less CYP3A induction."A comprehensive list 
of inhibitors, inducers, and substrates may be found at 
http://medicine.iupui.edu/clinpharm/ddis/main-table/  This website is continually revised and 
should be checked frequently for updates.
11.4 Dietary Restrictions
Ibrutinib
 should  be taken with water.
Seville oranges or grapefruit juice should be avoided

Phase I/Immune Response – Ibrutinib Page 65 of 10012 Reporting and Documentation of Results
12.1 Evaluation of  Efficacy (or Activity)
12.1.1 Antitumor Effect  – Solid Tumors
Response and progression in this  study will be evaluated using the new international criteria 
proposed by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST ) Committee [JNCI 
92(3):205-216, 2000].  Changes in only the largest diameter (unidimensional measurement) of 
the tumor lesions are used in the RECIST v1.1 criteria (or International Workshop  on Chronic 
Lymphocytic Leukemia [IWCLL] ).
12.1.1.1 Definitions
Evaluable for toxicity
All patients will be evaluable for toxicity from the time of their first treatment with the study drug.
Evaluable for objective  response
Only those patients who have measurable disease present at baseline, have received at least 
one cycle of 
therapy, and have had their disease re-evaluated will be considered evaluable for 
response.  These patients will have their response classified according to the definitions stated 
below.  (Note:  Patients who exhibit objective disease progression prior to the end of Cycle 1 will 
also be considered evaluable.)
12.1.1.2 Disease Parameters
Measurable 
disease
Measurable disease is defined as lesions (or tumors) that can be accurately measured in at 
least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) with a minimum size of 10mm by CT 
scan (irrespective of scanner type) and MRI (no less than double the slice thickness and a 
minimum of 10mm), 10mm caliper measurement by clinical exam (when superficial), and/or 
20mm by chest X-ray (if clearly defined and surrounded by aerated lung).
All tumor measurements will be recorded  in millimeters or decimal fractions of centimeters.  
Previously irradiated lesions are considered non-measurable except in cases of documented 
progression of the lesion since the completion of radiation therapy.
Target lesions
All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 5 lesions total (and a maximum of two lesions per 
organ) representative of all involved organs should be identified as target lesions and recorded 
and measured at baseline.  Target lesions will be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with 
the longest diameter) and their suitability for accurate repeated measurements (either by 
imaging techniques or clinically).  A sum of the longest diameter (LD) for all target lesions will be 
calculated and reported as the baseline sum LD.  The baseline sum LD will be used as 
reference by which to characterize the objective tumor response.
Non-target lesions
All other lesions (or sites of disease) including any measurable lesions over and above the 5 
target 
lesions should be identified as non-target lesions and should also be recorded at 
baseline.  It is possible to record multiple non-target lesions involving the same organ as a 
single item on the case record form (e.g. “multiple enlarged pelvic lymph nodes” or “multiple 
liver metastases”).  Bone lesions may be measureable if ≥ 1 cm on MRI.    Measurements of 
these lesions are not required, but the presence or absence of each will be noted throughout 
follow-up.
V4(28SEP2016) Protocol CC#:144525 
Phase I/Immune Response – Ibrutinib Page 66 of 100Non-measurable disease (Tumor Markers)
Non-measurable disease is all other lesions (or sites of disease), including small lesions 
(longest diameter < 20 mm with conventional techniques or < 10 mm using spiral CT scan).  
Leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural or pericardial effusion, inflammatory breast disease, 
lymphangitic involvement of skin or lung, abdominal masses/abdominal organomegaly identified 
by physical exam that is not measurable by reproducible imaging techniquesare all non-
measurable. (e.g. PSA, CA-125, CA19-9, CEA)
12.2 Evaluation of  Safety
Analyses will be performed for  all patients having received at least one dose of study drug.  The 
study will use the CTCAE v4.03 for reporting of non-hematologic adverse events and modified 
criteria for hematologic adverse events, see Section 6.3.
12.3 Follow-up of Adverse Events
All adverse events will be followed with appropriate medical management until resolved.  
Patients 
removed from study for unacceptable adverse events will be followed until resolution or 
stabilization of the adverse event.  For selected adverse events for which administration of the 
investigational drug was stopped, a re-challenge of the subject with the investigational drug may 
be conducted if considered both safe and ethical by the Investigator.
12.4 Adverse Events Monitoring 
All adverse events, whether or not unexpected, and whether or not considered to be associated 
with 
the use of the study drug, will be entered into OnCore®, as noted above.
The Investigator will assess all adverse events  and determine reportability requirements to the 
UCSF Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) and UCSF’s Institutional Review Board, 
the Committee on Human Research (CHR); and, when the study is conducted under an 
Investigational New Drug Application (IND), to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) if it 
meets the FDA reporting criteria..
All adverse events entered into OnCore® will be reviewed by the  Helen Diller Family 
Comprehensive Cancer Center Site Committee on a weekly basis.  The Site Committee will 
review and discuss at each weekly meeting the selected toxicity, the toxicity grade, and the 
attribution of relationship of the adverse event to the administration of the study drug(s).
In addition, all adverse events and suspected adverse reactions considered “serious,” entered 
into 
OnCore® will be reviewed and monitored by the Data and Safety Monitoring Committee on 
an ongoing basis, discussed at DSMC meetings which take place every six (6) weeks, and prior 
to dose escalation.  At the time of dose escalation, a written report will be submitted to the 
DSMC Chair (or qualified alternate) describing the cohorts, dose levels, adverse events, safety 
reports, and any Dose Limiting Toxicities observed, in accordance with the protocol.  The report 
will be reviewed by the DSMC Chair (or qualified alternate).  Approval for the dose escalation by 
the DSMC Chair (or qualified alternate) must be obtained prior to implementation.  For a 
detailed description of the Data and Safety Monitoring Plan for a Multicenter Phase 1 Dose 
Escalation Institutional Study at the Helen Diller Comprehensive Cancer Center please refer 
Appendix 2 Data and Safety Monitoring Plan for Phase 1 Dose Escalation.
12.5 Expedited Reporting 
Reporting 
to the Data and Safety Monitoring Committee
If a death occurs during the treatment phase of the study or within 30 days after the last 
administration 
of the study drug(s) and it is determined to be related either to the study drug(s) 
V4(28SEP2016) Protocol CC#:144525 
Phase I/Immune Response – Ibrutinib Page 67 of 100or to a study procedure, the Investigator or his/her designee must notify the DSMC Chair (or 
qualified 
alternate) within 1 business day of knowledge of the event.  The contact may be by 
phone or e-mail.
Reporting to UCSF Committee on Human Research (Institutional Review Board)
The Principal Investigator  must report events meeting the UCSF CHR definition of 
“Unanticipated Problem” (UP) within 10 business days of his/her awareness of the event. 
Expedited Reporting to the Food  and Drug Administration
If the study is being conducted under an IND, the Sponsor-Investigator is responsible for 
determining 
whether or not the suspected adverse reaction meets the criteria for expedited 
reporting in accordance with Federal Regulations (21 CFR §312.32). 
The Investigator must  report in an IND safety report any suspected adverse reaction that is both 
serious and unexpected.  The Sponsor-Investigator needs to ensure that the event meets all 
three definitions: 
Suspected adverse reaction (as defined in 11.1)
Unexpected (as defined in 11.2)
Serious (as defined in 11.2)
If the adverse event does not meet all three of the definitions, it should not be submitted as an 
expedited 
IND safety report.
The timeline for  submitting an IND safety report to FDA is no later than 15 calendar days after 
the Investigator determines that the suspected adverse reaction qualifies for reporting (21 CFR 
312.32(c)(1)). 
Any unexpected fatal  or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction will be reported to FDA no 
later than 7 calendar days after the Investigator’s initial receipt of the information (21 CFR 
312.32(c)(2)). 
Any relevant additional information  that pertains to a previously submitted IND safety report will 
be submitted to FDA as a Follow-up IND Safety Report without delay, as soon as the 
13 Study Management
13.1 Pre-study Documentation
This
 study will be conducted in accordance with the ethical principles that have their origin in the 
Declaration of Helsinki as stated in 21 CFR §312.120(c)(4); consistent with GCP and all 
applicable regulatory requirements.
Before initiating this trial,  the Investigator will have written and dated approval from the 
Institutional Review Board for the protocol, written informed consent form, subject recruitment 
materials, and any other written information to be provided to subjects before any protocol 
related procedures are performed on any subjects.  
The clinical investigation will  not begin until either FDA has determined that the study under the 
Investigational Drug Application (IND) is allowed to proceed or the Investigator has received a 
letter from FDA stating that the study is exempt from IND requirements. 
The Investigator must  comply with the applicable regulations in Title 21 of the Code of Federal 
Regulations (21 CFR §50, §54, and §312), GCP/ICH guidelines, and all applicable regulatory 
V4(28SEP2016) Protocol CC#:144525 
Phase I/Immune Response – Ibrutinib Page 68 of 100requirements.  The IRB must  comply with the regulations in 21 CFR §56 and applicable 
regulatory requirements.
13.2 Institutional Review Board Approval
The protocol, the  proposed informed consent form, and all forms of participant information 
related to the study (e.g. advertisements used to recruit participants) will be reviewed and 
approved by the UCSF CHR (UCSF Institutional Review Board).  Prior to obtaining CHR 
approval, the protocol must be approved by the Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer 
Center Site Committee and by the Protocol Review Committee (PRC).  The initial protocol and 
all protocol amendments must be approved by the IRB prior to implementation.  
13.3 Informed Consent
All
 participants must be provided  a consent form describing the study with sufficient information 
for each participant to make an informed decision regarding their participation.  Participants 
must sign the CHR-approved informed consent form prior to participation in any study specific 
procedure.  The participant must receive a copy of the signed and dated consent document.  
The original signed copy of the consent document must be retained in the medical record or 
research file. 
13.4 Changes in the Protocol
Once the protocol has been approved by the UCSF CHR, any changes to the protocol must be 
documented 
in the form of an amendment.  The amendment must be signed by the Investigator 
and approved by PRC and the CHR prior to implementation.  
Per the IST Agreement, any amendments to the Protocol or Informed Consent Form protocol 
must 
be sent to Pharmacyclics for review and approval prior to submission to the IRB.  Written 
verification of IRB approval will be obtained before any amendment is implemented. If it 
becomes necessary to alter the protocol to eliminate an immediate hazard to patients, an 
amendment may be implemented prior to CHR approval.  In this circumstance, however, the 
Investigator must then notify the CHR in writing within five (5) working days after 
implementation.  The Study Chair and the UCSF study team will be responsible for updating any 
participating sites.
13.5 Handling and Documentation of Clinical Supplies
The UCSF Principal Investigator and each participating site will maintain complete records 
showing the
 receipt, dispensation, return, or other disposition of all investigational drugs.  The 
date, quantity and batch or code number of the drug, and the identification of patients to whom 
study drug has been dispensed by patient number and initials will be included.  The sponsor-
investigator will maintain written records of any disposition of the study drug.
The Principal Investigator  shall not make the investigational drug available to any individuals 
other than to qualified study patients.  Furthermore, the Principal Investigator will not allow the 
investigational drug to be used in any manner other than that specified in this protocol.
13.6 Case Report Forms (CRFs)
The Principal Investigator  and/or his/her designee will prepare and maintain adequate and 
accurate participant case histories with observations and data pertinent to the study.  Study 
specific Case Report Forms (CRFs) will document safety and treatment outcomes for safety 
monitoring and data analysis.  All study data will be entered into OnCore® via standardized 
CRFs in accordance with the CTMS study calendar, using single data entry with a secure 
access account.  The Clinical Research Coordinator (CRC) will complete the CRFs as soon as 
V4(28SEP2016) Protocol CC#:144525 
Phase I/Immune Response – Ibrutinib Page 69 of 100possible upon completion of the study visit; the Investigator will review and approve the 
completed CRFs. 
The information collected  on CRFs shall be identical to that appearing in original source 
documents.  Source documents will be found in the patient’s medical records maintained by 
UCSF personnel.  All source documentation should be kept in separate research folders for 
each patient.
In accordance with federal  regulations, the Investigator is responsible for the accuracy and 
authenticity of all clinical and laboratory data entered onto CRFs.  The PI will approve all 
completed CRFs to attest that the information contained on the CRFs is true and accurate. 
All source documentation and CTMS data will be available for review/monitoring by the UCSF 
DSMC and regulatory agencies.
The Principal Investigator  will be responsible for ensuring the accurate capture of study data.  At 
study completion, when the CRFs have been declared to be complete and accurate, the 
database will be locked.  Any changes to the data entered into the CRFs  after that time can 
only be made by joint written agreement among the Study Chair, the Trial Statistician, and the 
Protocol Project Manager.
13.7 Oversight and Monitoring Plan
The UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center DSMC will be the monitoring 
entity 
for this study.  The UCSF DSMC will monitor the study in accordance with the NCI-
approved Data and Safety Monitoring Plan (DSMP).  The DSMC will routinely review all adverse 
events and suspected adverse reactions considered “serious”.  The DSMC will audit study-
related activities to ensure that the study is conducted in accordance with the protocol, local 
standard operating procedures, FDA regulations, and Good Clinical Practice (GCP).  Significant 
results of the DSMC audit will be communicated to the IRB and the appropriate regulatory 
authorities at the time of continuing review, or in an expedited fashion, as applicable.  See 
Appendix 5 Data and Safety Monitoring Plan for Phase 1 Dose Escalation Institutional Study, for 
additional information.
13.8 Multicenter communication
The
 UCSF Coordinating Center provides administration, data management, and organizational 
support 
for the participating sites in the conduct of a multicenter clinical trial.  The UCSF 
Coordinating Center for Phase II studies will also coordinate, at minimum, monthly conference 
calls with the participating sites at the completion of each cohort or more frequently as needed 
to discuss risk assessment.  The following issues will be discussed as appropriate: 
Enrollment information
Adverse
 events  (i.e. new adverse events and updates on unresolved adverse events and 
new safety information)
Protocol violations
Other
 issues affecting the conduct of the study.
13.9 Record Keeping and Record Retention
The Principal Investigator  is required to maintain adequate records of the disposition of the 
drug, including dates, quantity, and use by subjects, as well as written records of the disposition 
of the drug when the study ends.  
V4(28SEP2016) Protocol CC#:144525 
Phase I/Immune Response – Ibrutinib Page 70 of 100The Principal Investigator  is required to prepare and maintain adequate and accurate case 
histories that record all observations and other data pertinent to the investigation on each 
individual administered the investigational drug or employed as a control in the investigation. 
Case histories include the case report forms and supporting data including, for example, signed 
and dated consent forms and medical records including, for example, progress notes of the 
physician, the individual's hospital chart(s), and the nurses' notes. The case history for each 
individual shall document that informed consent was obtained prior to participation in the study.
Study documentation includes all CRFs, data correction forms or queries, source documents, 
Sponsor-Investigator correspondence, monitoring logs/letters, and regulatory documents (e.g., 
protocol and amendments, CHR correspondence and approval, signed patient consent forms).
Source documents include all recordings of  observations or notations of clinical activities and all 
reports and records necessary for the evaluation and reconstruction of the clinical research 
study.
In accordance with FDA  regulations, the investigator shall retain records for a period of 2 years 
following the date a marketing application is approved for the drug for the indication for which it 
is being investigated; or, if no application is to be filed or if the application is not approved for 
such indication, until 2 years after the investigation is discontinued and FDA is notified.
13.10 Coordinating Center Documentation of Distribution 
It is the responsibility of the Study Chair to maintain adequate files documenting the distribution 
of 
study documents as well as their receipt (when possible). The HDFCCC recommends that 
the Study Chair maintain a correspondence file and log for each segment of distribution (e.g., 
FDA, drug manufacturer, participating sites, etc.).
Correspondence file: should contain  copies (paper or electronic) of all protocol versions, cover 
letters, amendment outlines (summary of changes), etc., along with distribution documentation 
and (when available) documentation of receipt.
Correspondence log: should be a brief list of all documents distributed including the date sent, 
recipient(s), and (if available) a tracking number and date received.
At a minimum, the  Study Chair must keep documentation of when and to whom the protocol, its 
updates and safety information are distributed.
13.11 Regulatory Documentation 
Prior
 to implementing this protocol at UCSF HDFCCC, the protocol, informed consent form, 
HIPAA 
authorization and any other information pertaining to participants must be approved by 
the UCSF Committee on Human Research (CHR). Prior to implementing this protocol at the 
participating sites, approval for the UCSF CHR approved protocol must be obtained from the 
participating site’s IRB. 
The following documents must  be provided to UCSF HDFCCC before the participating site can 
be initiated and begin enrolling participants: 
Participating Site IRB approval(s) for the protocol, appendices, informed consent 
form and HIPAA authorization 
Participating Site IRB approved consent form

Upon receipt of  the required documents, UCSF HDFCCC will formally contact the site and grant 
permission to proceed with enrollment.
14 Protection of Human Subjects
14.1 Protection from Unnecessary Harm 
Each clinical site  is responsible for protecting all subjects involved in human experimentation. 
This is accomplished through the CHR mechanism and the process of informed consent. The 
CHR reviews all proposed studies involving human experimentation and ensures that the 
subject’s rights and welfare are protected and that the potential benefits and/or the importance 
of the knowledge to be gained outweigh the risks to the individual. The CHR also reviews the 
informed consent document associated with each study in order to ensure that the consent 
document accurately and clearly communicates the nature of the research to be done and its 
associated risks and benefits. 
14.2 Protection of Privacy
Patients will be informed of  the extent to which their confidential health information generated 
from this study may be used for research purposes. Following this discussion, they will be asked 
to sign the HIPAA form and informed consent documents. The original signed document will 
become part of the patient’s medical records, and each patient will receive a copy of the signed 
document. The use and disclosure of protected health information will be limited to the 
individuals described in the informed consent document.

a. Pre-treatment assessments  will be completed within 14 days of start of therapy.  The Informed Consent and scans can be 
completed within 28 days of start of therapy. The pregnancy test (for women of child-bearing potential) should be completed 
within 72 hours prior start of therapy.
b. Daily dosing with ibrutinib  should begin day 1 of cycle 1, and should continue through-out the 28 day cycles until patient is off 
study treatment. 
c. Treatment with  gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel is to be administered on days 1, 8, 15 of each 28 day cycle.  Ibrutinib will be 
taken orally, each day of the 28 day treatment cycle.  While every effort should be made to adhere to this schedule, +/- 2 days 
from any scheduled treatment is acceptable due to holidays, travel issues, or other logistics.
d. End of study visit should be completed within 30 days of the last dose.  In the event that the patient is too ill or frail to return to 
clinic for this 
EOT visit, this will not  constitute a protocol violation.
e. Vital signs including BP,  pulse and temperature should be documented with each PE.  Vital signs should also be documented 
with any signs or symptoms during or immediately after an infusion.  Perform complete physical examination at screening.  A 
limited PE will be repeated on Day 15 of Cycle 1 only.  A limited PE related to signs, symptoms and concurrent illnesses is 
appropriate during Study Treatment.  Height only required during Pre-treatment.
f. These procedures to not need to be repeated if they were performed within the preceding 14 days (eg during the pre-
treatment 
period).
f.2. Only for patients with elevated levels ≥ 2 x ULN at baseline.
V4(28SEP2016) Protocol CC#:144525 
Phase I/Immune Response – Ibrutinib Page 74 of 100g. CMP will include measurements of glucose, BUN, creatinine, sodium, potassium, chloride, calcium, CO2, ALP, AST (SGOT), 
ALT 
(SGPT), total bilirubin, total protein, and albumin.
h. EDTA blood collection  for baseline cytokine, B an T cell receptor profiling, and myeloid cell characterization and BTK 
occupancy assays should be drawn before beginning combination therapy on day 1 cycle 1, and day 1 of  the  subsequent 
cycles before infusion of gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel .  The correlative blood samples will be processed at UCSF before 
shipping to other sites for analyses.
i. Archived tumor  tissue will be collected for this study.  Tissue may be collected at Pre-treatment or at any time during the 
study.
j. Tumor assessment occurs at the end of every 2 cycles, during the last week of the cycle.  The evaluations should be 
completed 
at the end of every 2 cycles regardless of any treatment delays.  This typically will consist of CT scans of the 
chest/abdomen/pelvis.  MRI represents an acceptable alternative for patients with increased risk of contrast related 
nephropathy or other contraindications.  Baseline and subsequent imaging must be by the same type of procedure (e.g. CT 
vs. MRI scan).
k. Patients who discontinue  study treatment prior to the occurrence of disease progression will be followed every 8 weeks from 
the date of last dose of trial drug until disease progression or for up to 2 years whichever comes first.  Any subsequent cancer 
therapy will be documented.
l. Patients with  documented disease progression will be followed every 2 months for survival status (e.g., date and cause of 
death) for up to 2 years or death whichever comes first.  Information on the start date, type and duration of any subsequent 
anticancer therapy will be collected.  Patients may be contacted during outpatient visits, by documented telephone contact 
with the patient or through contact with the primary practitioner or caregiver
m. 12-lead ECGs will be done in triplicate (≥1 minute apart); the calculated QTcF average of the 3 ECGs must be <470 msec for 
eligibility.  
Abnormalities noted at Screening should be included in the medical history.
n. ECGs should be performed  at the investigator’s discretion, particularly in subjects with arrhythmic symptoms (eg, palpitations, 
lightheadedness) or new onset of dyspnea.
o. Screening tests for  Hepatitis Virus to include HBsAg, Hepatitis B core antibody (HBcAb), total, and HCV Antibody.  If either of 
the HBV tests are positive, order HBV DNA quantification by PCR. If HBV DNA positive, determine if anti-viral therapy if DNA 
is necessary.

a. Pre-treatment assessments  will be completed within 14 days of start of therapy.  The Informed Consent and scans can be 
completed within 28 days of start of therapy. The pregnancy test (for women of child-bearing potential) should be completed 
within 72 hours prior start of therapy.
b. Day 1 of the 7 day ibrutinib-only run-in period should begin at least 5 days after the pretreatment EUS guided biopsy.  Dosing 
with 
ibrutinib should be stopped for at least 5 day before performing the post-ibrutinib EUS-guided biopsy.  Day 1 Cycle 1 of 
the combination treatment with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel may occur at 1-3 days after the post-ibrutinib run-in biopsy, 
and daily oral dosing with ibrutinib may commence 5-7 days post-biopsy. 
c. Treatment with  gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel is to be administered on days 1, 8, 15 of each 28 day cycle.  Ibrutinib will be 
taken orally, each day of the 28 day treatment cycle.  While every effort should be made to adhere to this schedule, +/- 2 days 
from any scheduled treatment is acceptable due to holidays, travel issues, or other logistics.
d. End of study visit should be completed within 30 days of the last dose.  In the event that the patient is too ill or frail to return to 
clinic for this 
EOT visit, this will not  constitute a protocol violation.
V4(28SEP2016) Protocol CC#:144525 
Phase I/Immune Response – Ibrutinib Page 77 of 100e. Vital signs including BP,  pulse and temperature should be documented with each PE.  Vital signs should also be documented 
with any signs or symptoms during or immediately after an infusion.  Perform complete physical examination at screening.  A 
limited PE will be repeated on Day 15 of Cycle 1 only.  A limited PE related to signs, symptoms and concurrent illnesses is 
appropriate during Study Treatment.  Height only required during Pre-treatment.
f. These procedures to not need to be repeated if they were performed within the preceding 14 days (eg during the pre-
treatment 
period).
f.2. Only for patients with elevated levels ≥ 2 x ULN at baseline.
g. CMP
 will include measurements of glucose, BUN, creatinine, sodium, potassium, chloride, calcium, CO2, ALP, AST (SGOT), 
ALT 
(SGPT), total bilirubin, total protein, and albumin.
h. EDTA Blood collection  for baseline cytokine, B and T cell receptor profiling, and myeloid cell characterization and BTK 
occupancy assays should be drawn before and after the 7 day ibrutinib run-in, before the EUS-guided biopsies are 
performed.  Blood collection for the correlative analyses will also occur on day 1 of cycle 2 and subsequent cycles of 
combination therapy before infusion of gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel begins.  The correlative blood samples will be 
processed at UCSF before shipping to other sites for analyses.
i. Archived tumor  tissue will be collected for this study.  Tissue may be collected at Pre-treatment or at any time during  the 
study.
j. Tumor assessment occurs at the end of every 2 cycles, during the last week of the cycle.  The evaluations should be 
completed 
at the end of every 2 cycles regardless of any treatment delays.  This typically will consist of CT scans of the 
chest/abdomen/pelvis.  MRI represents an acceptable alternative for patients with increased risk of contrast related 
nephropathy or other contraindications.  Baseline and subsequent imaging must be by the same type of procedure (e.g. CT 
vs. MRI scan).
k. Patients who discontinue  study treatment prior to the occurrence of disease progression will be followed every 8 weeks from 
the date of last dose of trial drug until disease progression or for up to 2 years whichever comes first.  Any subsequent cancer 
therapy will be documented.
l. Patients with  documented disease progression will be followed every 2 months for survival status (e.g., date and cause of 
death) for up to 2 years or death whichever comes first.  Information on the start date, type and duration of any subsequent 
anticancer therapy will be collected.  Patients may be contacted during outpatient visits, by documented telephone contact 
with the patient or through contact with the primary practitioner or caregiver.
m. 12-lead ECGs will be done in triplicate (≥1 minute apart); the calculated QTcF average of the 3 ECGs must be <470 msec for

Women of Child-Bearing Potential are Defined as Follows:
Any female who has experienced menarche and does not meet the criteria for 
“Women 
Not of Childbearing Potential”.
 
Women Not of Childbearing Potential are Defined as Follows:
 Women who are permanently sterilized (e.g., tubal occlusion, hysterectomy, 
bilateral salpingectomy, bilateral oophorectomy)
 Women who are >45 years of age, not using hormone replacement therapy 
and who have experienced total cessation of menses for at least 1 year OR 
who have a follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) value >40 mIU/mL and an 
estradiol value <40pg/mL (140 pmol/L)

Phase I/Immune Response – Ibrutinib Page 84 of 100Appendix 4 Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.1)
Patients with Measureable Disease
Lesions are either measurable or non-measurable using the criteria provided below.  The 
term “evaluable” in reference to measurability will not be used, as it does not provide 
additional meaning or accuracy.
Baseline Eligibility
Measurable Disease: Tumor lesions:  Must  be accurately measured in at least one 
dimension (longest diameter in the plane of measurement is 
to be recorded) with a minimum size of:
10 mm by CT scan (CT scan slice thickness no greater than 5 
mm).
10 mm caliper measurement by clinical exam (lesions that 
cannot 
be accurately measured with calipers should be 
recorded as non-measurable).
20 mm by chest X-ray.
Skin 
lesions:  Documentation  by color photography, including 
a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion, is recommended.
Malignant lymph nodes:  To be considered pathologically 
enlarged and measurable, a lymph node must be >15 mm in 
short axis when assessed by CT scan.  At baseline and in 
follow-up, only the short axis will be measured and followed. 
Non-Measurable Disease: All other lesions, including small lesions (longest diameter 
<10 mm or pathological lymph nodes with >10- to <15-mm 
short axis) as well as truly non-measurable lesions.  Lesions 
considered truly non-measurable include: leptomeningeal 
disease, ascites, pleural or pericardial effusion, inflammatory 
breast disease, lymphangitic involvement of skin or lung, 
abdominal masses, and abdominal organomegaly identified by 
physical exam that is not measurable by reproducible imaging 
requirements. 
V4(28SEP2016) Protocol CC#:144525 
Phase I/Immune Response – Ibrutinib Page 85 of 100Target Lesions: Selected lesions, up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ and 
5 lesions in total, representative of all involved organs should 
be identified as target lesions and recorded and measured at 
baseline.  
Target lesions should be selected  on the basis of their size 
(lesions with the longest diameter), should be representative 
of all involved organs, and in addition should be those that 
lend themselves to reproducible repeated measurements.  
Pathological nodes which are defined as measurable and that 
may be identified as target lesions must meet the criterion or 
a short axis of >15 mm by CT scan.
A sum of the diameters (longest for non-nodal lesions, short 
axis for 
nodal lesions) for all target lesions will be calculated 
and reported as the baseline sum diameters.  If lymph nodes 
are to be included in the sum, then as noted above, only the 
short axis is added into the sum.  The baseline sum diameters 
will be used as reference to further characterize any objective 
tumor response.
Non-Target Lesions: All other lesions should be identified as non-target lesions at 
baseline.  
Measurements of these lesions are not required, 
but the presence or absence of each should be noted 
throughout follow-up.
Guidelines for Evaluation  of Measurable Disease 
All measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation, using a ruler or calipers.  
All baseline evaluations should be performed as closely as possible to the beginning of 
treatment, as per study screening requirements.
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize 
each identified 
and reported lesion at baseline and during follow-up.  Imaging-based 
evaluation is preferred to evaluation by clinical examination when both methods have been 
used to assess the anti-tumor effect of a treatment.
Clinical Lesions: Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they 
are superficial (e.g., skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes).  
In the case of skin lesions, documentation by color 
photography, including a ruler to estimate the size of the 
lesion, is recommended.
Chest X-ray: Lesions on chest X-ray are acceptable as measurable lesions 
when they 
are clearly defined and surrounded by aerated 
lung.  However, CT is preferable.
V4(28SEP2016) Protocol CC#:144525 
Phase I/Immune Response – Ibrutinib Page 86 of 100Conventional CT and MRI: CT is the best currently available and reproducible method to 
measure target 
lesions selected for response assessment.  
This guideline has defined measurability of lesions on CT 
scan based on the assumption that CT slice thickness is 5mm 
or less.  MRI of the chest should only be performed in 
extenuating circumstances.  Even if IV contract cannot be 
administered (for example, in the situation of allergy to 
contract), a non-contrast CT of the chest is still preferred over 
MRI.
Ultrasound: Ultrasound should not  be used to measure tumor lesions.  
Ultrasound may be useful to confirm the complete 
disappearance of superficial lesions usually assessed by 
clinical examination.
Endoscopy and 
Laparoscopy:Use of endoscopy and laparoscopy should not be used to 
measure tumor 
lesions. Such techniques can be useful in 
confirming complete pathological response when biopsies are 
obtained.
Tumor Markers: Tumor markers alone cannot  be used to assess response.  If 
markers are initially above the upper limit of normal, they 
must normalize for a subject to be considered in complete 
clinical response when all lesions have disappeared.
Cytology and Histology: Cytology and histology can be used to differentiate between 
PR and CR in rare cases (e.g., after treatment to differentiate 
between residual benign lesions and residual malignant 
lesions in tumor types such as germ cell tumors).
V4(28SEP2016) Protocol CC#:144525 
Phase I/Immune Response – Ibrutinib Page 87 of 100Response Criteria
Evaluation of Target  Lesions
Complete Response: Complete disappearance of  all target lesions.  Any 
pathological lymph node (target or non-target) must have a 
reduction in short axis to < 10 mm).  
Partial Response: A decrease from baseline  of ≥30% of the diameter(s) of all 
target lesions.
Stable Disease:  Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient 
increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest 
(nadir) sum of the diameters of target lesions while on study.
Progressive Disease:  At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target 
lesions, 
taking as reference the smallest (nadir) sum while on 
study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on 
study), or the appearance of one or more new lesions.  
Requires not only 20% increase, but absolute increase of a 
minimum of 5 mm over sum.
Evaluation of Non-Target  Lesions
Complete Response: Disappearance of all non-target  lesions.  All lymph nodes 
must be non-pathological in size (<10 mm short axis).
Stable Disease:   Persistence of one or more non-target lesions.
Progressive Disease: Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal 
progression of existing non-target lesions.  When the subject 
also has measurable disease, to achieve “unequivocal 
progression” on the basis of the non-target disease, there 
must be an overall level of substantial worsening in non-target 
disease such that, even in presence of SD or PR in the target 
disease, the overall tumor burden has increased sufficiently to 
merit discontinuation of therapy.

 (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest 
measurements recorded since the treatment started).  In general, the subject’s best response 
assignment will depend on the achievement of both measurement and confirmation criteria.  
Target Lesions Non-Target Lesions New Lesions Overall 
Response
CR CR NO CR
CR SD NO PR
CR NE NO PR
PR SD OR NE NO PR
SD SD OR NE NO SD
PD ANY YES OR NO PD
ANY PD YES OR NO PD
ANY ANY YES PD
NE SD NO NE
Abbreviations: CR=complete response; NE=not evaluable; PD = progressive disease; 
PR=partial response; SD=stable disease.
In some circumstances, it may be difficult to distinguish residual disease from normal tissue.  
When 
the evaluation of a CR depends upon this determination, it is recommended that the 
residual lesion be investigated by fine needle aspirate or biopsy to confirm the CR status. 
When nodal disease is included in the sum of target lesions, and the nodes decrease to 
“normal” size (<10 mm), they may still have a measurement reported on scans.  This 
measurement should be recorded even though the nodes are normal in order not to overstate 
progression, should it be based on increase in size of the nodes.  As noted earlier, this means 
that patients with CR may not have a total sum of “zero” on the CRF.

Phase I/Immune Response – Ibrutinib Page 89 of 100Appendix 5 Data and Safety Monitoring Plan for a Multicenter Institutional Study (Phase 
1 Dose Escalation Institutional Study)
The UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center (HDFCCC) Data and Safety 
Monitoring 
Committee (DSMC) is responsible for monitoring data quality and subject safety for 
all HDFCCC institutional clinical studies. A summary of DSMC activities for this study includes:
• Review of subject  data in each cohort
• Review of suspected  adverse reactions considered “serious”
• Approval of dose escalation  by DSMC Chair (or qualified alternate)
• Monthly monitoring (depending on study accrual)
• Minimum of a yearly regulatory audit
Monitoring and Reporting Guidelines
All institutional Phase 1 therapeutic  studies are designated with a high risk assessment. The 
data is monitored monthly as subjects are enrolled and includes all visits monitored up through 
the Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) period. At the time of dose escalation, a written report will be 
submitted to the DSMC Chair outlining the cohort dose, all adverse events and suspected 
adverse reactions considered “serious”, and any Dose Limiting Toxicity as described in the 
protocol. The report will be reviewed by the DSMC Chair or qualified alternate and written 
authorization to proceed or a request for more information will be issued within 2 business days 
of the request. The report is then reviewed at the subsequent DSMC meeting. In the event that 
the committee does not concur with the DSMC Chair’s decision, further study accrual is held 
while further investigation takes place.
The Principal Investigator  at the UCSF Coordinating Center will hold the role of Study Chair. 
The Study Chair is responsible for the overall conduct of the study and for monitoring its safety 
and progress at all participating sites. The Study Chair will conduct continuous review of data 
and subject safety and discuss each subject’s treatment at weekly UCSF Site Committee 
meetings. The discussions are documented in the UCSF Site Committee meeting minutes. For 
each dose level, the discussion will include the number of patients, significant toxicities in 
accordance with the protocol, doses adjustments, and observed responses.
Multicenter communication
The UCSF Coordinating Center provides administration, data management, and organizational 
support 
for the participating sites in the conduct of a multicenter clinical trial. The UCSF 
Coordinating Center will also coordinate, at minimum, monthly conference calls with the 
participating sites at the completion of each cohort or more frequently as needed to discuss risk 
assessment. The following issues will be discussed as appropriate:
Enrollment information
Cohort
 updates (i.e. DLTs)
Adverse events  (i.e. new adverse events and updates on unresolved adverse events 
and new safety information)
Protocol violations
Other
 issues affecting the conduct of the study
V4(28SEP2016) Protocol CC#:144525 
Phase I/Immune Response – Ibrutinib Page 90 of 100Dose Level Considerations
The
 PI/Study Chair, participating  investigators, and research coordinators from each site will 
review enrollment for each dose level cohort during the regularly scheduled conference calls. 
The dose level for ongoing enrollment will be confirmed for each subject scheduled to be 
enrolled at a site. Dose level assignments for any subject scheduled to begin treatment must be 
confirmed by the UCSF Coordinating Center via fax or e-mail.
If a Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) arises in a subject treated at a study site, all sites must be 
notified 
immediately by the UCSF Coordinating Center. The Study Chair has 1 business day 
(after first becoming aware of the event at either the UCSF Coordinating Center or the 
participating site) in which to report the information to all participating sites. If the DLT occurs at 
a participating site, the local investigator must report it to the UCSF Coordinating Center within 1 
business day, after which the UCSF Coordinating Center will notify the other participating sites.
Adverse events reporting  to the DSMC will include reports from both the UCSF Coordinating 
Center, as well as the participating sites. The DSMC will be responsible for monitoring all data 
entered in OnCore® at the UCSF Coordinating Center and the participating sites. The data (i.e. 
copies of source documents) from the participating sites will be faxed over to the UCSF 
Coordinating Center prior to the monitoring visits in order for the DSMC to monitor the 
participating site’s compliance with the protocol, patient safety, and to verify data entry.
All clinically significant  adverse events (AEs), whether or not unexpected, and whether or not 
considered to be associated with the use of study drug, will be entered into OnCore®, UCSF’s 
Clinical Trial Management System.
All clinically significant  adverse events entered into OnCore® will be reviewed on a weekly basis 
at the UCSF Coordinating Center’s Site Committee. All clinically significant adverse events must 
be reported to the UCSF Coordinating Center by the participating sites within 10 business days 
of becoming aware of the event. The Site Committee will review and discuss the selected 
toxicity, the toxicity grade, and the attribution of relationship of the adverse event to the 
administration of the study drug(s).
In addition, all suspected adverse reactions considered “serious” are entered into OnCore® and 
will be reviewed and monitored
 by the Data and Safety Monitoring Committee on an ongoing 
basis and discussed at the DSMC meetings, which take place every six (6) weeks.
All suspected adverse reactions  considered “serious” should be reported to the UCSF 
Coordinating Center within 1 business day of becoming aware of the event or during the next 
scheduled conference call, whichever is sooner.
If a death occurs during the treatment phase of the study or within 30 days after the last 
administration 
of the study drug(s) and is determined to be related either to the investigational 
drug or any research related procedure, the Study Chair at the UCSF Coordinating Center or 
the assigned designee must be notified within 1 business day from the participating site(s) and 
the Study Chair must then notify the DSMC Chair or qualified alternate within 1 business day of 
this notification. The contact may be by phone or e-mail.
Increase in Adverse Event Rates
If
 an increase in the frequency of Grade 3 or 4 adverse events (above the rate reported in the 
Investigator 
Brochure or package insert), the Study Chair at the UCSF Coordinating Center is 
responsible for notifying the DSMC at the time the increased rate is identified. The report will 
indicate if the incidence of adverse events observed in the study is above the range stated in 
the Investigator Brochure or package insert.

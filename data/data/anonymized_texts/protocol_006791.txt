Key Information About This Study   
 
The following is a short summary of this study to help you decide whether or not to participate.  More 
detailed information follows later in th is form.  
 
The purpose of this study is to  evaluate the causes of  and treatment for feeding difficult y in infants with 
Gastro -esophageal Reflux Disease (GERD).  You are being asked to enroll your child in this study 
because they had a Reflux index higher th an 3 on a pH/impedance test.  
 
Study participation:  
If you decide to enroll your child in this study, they will undergo a n esophageal manometry test to see 
how well the muscles of the throat, food pipe and stomach work together. Then your child will be 
randomized into one of two groups. The difference between the two groups will be in feeding volumes 
and positons. Both groups will receive medication for Gastroesophageal Reflux. They will receive the 
medication for 4 weeks. After that we will repeat the mano metry study and your child will have another 
pH/impedance test.  
 
Study visits:  
The first pH /impedance testing and manometry will take place while your child is in the NICU.  
The second pH/impedance study will take place 5 weeks later. If your child has b een discharged, you 
will be asked to bring them back to the hospital for an overnight stay.  
If your child has been discharged, you may be asked to keep a diary for us until the 2nd study is 
scheduled  
See a more detailed discussion later in this form.  
 
The main risk(s) of the study comes from having the manometry catheter and pH/impedance catheters. 
These are same as when any tube is placed through the nose and can include redness, irritation and 
minor bleeding. There are no known risks of using the medicat ion for GERD.

The benefit(s) of the study are your child will receive evaluation and close observation related to GERD, 
feeding  and breathing problems.  Information known from other studies may be of benefit to your chi ld.   
Your participation may ad d to medical knowledge about infants who are at risk of feeding difficulty due 
to GERD and airway disease.

1) INTRODUCTION  
We invite you to be in this research study .  Using this form as a guide, we will explain the study to 
you. If you have any questions about the study, please ask. By signing this form, you agree to be in 
this study. If you do not want to be in this study, all regular and standard medical care will still be 
available to you here at Nationwide Children’s Hospital. Participation is voluntary.  You can leave 
this study at any time.  
 
You will be given a signed and dated copy of the consent and the assent forms.  
 
2) WHERE WILL THE STUDY BE DONE AND HOW MA NY SUBJECTS WILL TAKE PART?   
 
This study will be done at Nationwide Children’s Hospital and we hope to enroll 120 participants .  
 
 
 
3)   WHAT WILL HAPPEN DURING THE STUDY  AND HOW LONG WILL IT LAST ? 
 If you  decide to enroll your child in this study,  we will  start by doing a manometry study. A manometry 
study is test to see how well the muscles of the food pipe (esophagus) work together. A special 
feeding tube called a ma nometry tube is passed through  your child’s nose into the food pipe . This 
tube is similar  to the tube used for feeding babies in the NICU.  This  tube is then connected to a 
machine that measures the movement of t he muscles of the food pipe.   
 
Once the manometry tube is placed, we will test how well your baby swallows. To do this we, will put 
6-8 teaspoons of room air and 3-4 teaspoons of  sterile water through the manometry tube and into the 
middle of your baby’s food pipe.  We will start with small amount so of each of those things and work 
our way up to larger amounts.  Then, we will put 3 -4 teaspoons of Gerber Apple Juice into the middle 
of the food pipe to test how your baby handles acid reflux.  Apple juice contain s sugar, fiber, vitamins 
and i s slightly acidic, but is gentler than stomach acid. To test your baby’s suck -swallow coordination, 
we will be using a device called an N -trainer. The N -trainer uses a pacifier on a receiver to create 
waveforms visible on a screen that can be used to evaluate a baby’s suck -swallow pattern. Another 
way we will evaluate your baby’s suck -swallow pattern is by using small pressure sensors that are 
threaded into a pacifier and a nipple. These sensors are small and your baby will not be able to feel 
them. Finally, we will feed your baby to test  how well they can eat from a bottle.    
To tell when a swallow beg ins, the activity of the muscles of the n eck will be recorded with the help of 
sticky leads (like chest leads) placed on the chin. To watch facial movements and behaviors  during

 the study and match them to what is going on in the food pipe , we will record video using a video 
camera.                
 
Because GERD can affect the vocal cords,  we will also take an ultrasound of the vocal cords during 
the manometry study.  An ultrasound probe will be placed over the surface of neck.  This is not an 
invasive proce dure, and there are no risks associated with this procedure.  The ultrasound gel will be 
wiped off at the completion of the procedure. The manometry study is  recor ded for approximately 3 
hours.  
 
This study is randomized. Randomized means that each subject will be picked by chance, like tossing 
a coin or drawing straws, to receive either the regular treatment for GERD or the new treatment.  
 
Following the manometry  study, your child will be placed into one of two groups of patients. One 
group will receive th e current, standard treatment for GERD, which includes feeding regular volumes 
of formula, no restricti on on how long the feed lasts, what position th e baby is in during the feeding , or 
what position the baby is placed in when returned to his/her crib, and  treatment with medication .  
 
If your baby is placed in the second group of patients he or she will receive the following treatment:  
Restricted feeding volumes  with increased calories, taking at least 30 minutes to finish a feed , placing 
the baby on his/h er right side during feeds and placing them on their back once they are returned to 
the crib following a feed. This group will be treated with medication, too . 
 
After four weeks of treatment, the medications will be stopped and one week later your baby wil l be 
restudied using both the pH/impedance study  and manometry study . Your baby’s progress will be 
monitored bet ween studies by using feeding diaries and by looking at the chart in EPIC.  
 
We will also be following your baby throughout the first year by mo nitoring clinic visits and phone calls 
to you.

Babies who are in the NICU often have tubes placed through the nose for feeding.  Feeding tubes 
are generally very safe and  effective. However, even if it is placed gently, a feeding tube can irritate 
the nose, mouth, or  stomach and cause some minor  bleeding.  The special tube used in our study  is 
placed under close monitoring, and is thought to be safer and thinner tha n regula r feeding tubes.  To 
minimize the risk of discomfort during tube placement, we coat the tube with a water - based gel.  
We also use sucrose on a pacif ier for calming the baby down. These are standard practice s in the 
nursery to comfort babies.  If  there are symptoms during the procedure , you r baby  will receive 
medical help right away.  We have done  over 500 studies f rom different centers using this method 
and we  have not witnessed any complications . 
 
 If you are worried about anything while in this study, ple ase call the study doctor 
(Sudarshan R. Jadcherla, MD) or study  coordinator (Rebecca Moore, RN, BSN ) at the 
telephone number at 614 -355-6635 .  There may be other risks of being in this research study 
which are not known at this time

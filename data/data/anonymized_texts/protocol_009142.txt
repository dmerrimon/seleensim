6 Version Date:April 3, 2019INTRODUCTION
Angiosarcoma is  an aggressive soft tissue sarcoma of endothelial differentiation. 
Angiosarcoma has a particularly poor prognosis with 5 year overall survival rates of 
approximately 30-40%. Deaths are almost universally attributable to distant metastatic 
disease. Median overall survival of metastatic angiosarcoma is less than one year (1). In 
addition to clinically aggressive behavior, survival is limited by a paucity of efficacious 
systemic therapies. The identification of novel, active agents is urgently needed to improve 
the duration and quality of life for angiosarcoma patients.
1.1 BACKGROUND
Treatment of  locally advanced and metastatic angiosarcoma is inadequate. Three 
phase II trials have been conducted in this setting. The first, ANGIOTAX, examined 
weekly paclitaxel in 30 patients with metastatic or unresectable angiosarcoma 
between April 2005 and October 2006 (1). Progression-free survival at 4 months was 
45%. Response rate was less than 20% and median overall survival was 8 months. 
Despite these sobering results, retrospective analysis has demonstrated that weekly 
paclitaxel is slightly more active than single agent doxorubicin – the mainstay of 
metastatic soft tissue sarcoma therapy (2). A small retrospective series of 25 locally 
advanced or metastatic angiosarcoma patients treated between January 2008 and 
November 2010 suggests single agent gemcitabine may also have modest activity in 
this disease (3).
The inability  of traditional cytotoxins to durably control angiosarcoma coupled with the 
observation this malignancy displays endothelial differentiation prompted interest in 
targeted anti-vascular therapies. Consequently, the two additional phase II trials in 
this setting have examined agents that antagonize the VEGF-VEGFR signaling axis. 
Agulnik and colleagues reported their phase II experience with bevacizumab in 
unresectable and metastatic angiosarcoma  (4). Between August 2005 and April 2011, 
23 angiosarcoma patients were treated with single agent bevacizumab. The median 
progression-free and overall survival were 3 months and 1 year, respectively.
Responses were rare  with only 2 (9%) experiencing a partial response. The French 
Sarcoma Group reported the third phase II trial in angiosarcoma examining the multi- 
targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor, sorafenib, in 41 patients treated between June 2008 
and June 2009 (5). Although progression-free and overall survival rates were 
disappointing, a 40% tumor control rate and 23% response rate were observed in 
patients previously treated with cytotoxic chemotherapy.
Taken together,  these data suggest both (A) conventional cytotoxic therapy is 
inadequate in angiosarcoma and (B) the most promising approach observed in phase 
II trials is multi-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibition after failure of conventional cytotoxic 
therapy. As discussed in detail below, regorafenib is a highly promising agent in 
angiosarcoma. Similar to bevacizumab and sorafenib, regorafenib antagonizes the 
endothelial VEGF-VEGFR axis. However, in contrast to these agents (and other 
tested VEGFR antagonists such as sunitinib), regorafenib also displays potent activity 
against the endothelial Tie2 tyrosine kinase receptor – a newly identified therapeutic 
target in human angiosarcomas. Consequently, we have hypothesized that 
regorafenib will display clinically meaningful activity in patients with refractory, locally 
advanced and metastatic angiosarcoma.
1.2 RATIONALE FOR THE STUDY
The greater  activity of sorafenib in advanced angiosarcoma compared to 
bevacizumab and sunitinib prompted the hypothesis that this enhanced activity

7 Version Date:April 3, 2019derived from  a broader range of kinase inhibition. In particular, the greater activity of 
sorafenib was hypothesized to result from inhibition of the Tie2 kinase receptor.
Sorafenib displays  modest activity against Tie2 in cell-based assays (IC 50 330 nM).
To determine  if Tie2 receptor kinase antagonism may be a viable therapeutic strategy 
in advanced angiosarcoma, expression of Tie2 signaling components (Tie1, Tie2, 
Ang1 and Ang2) was assessed in 51 human angiosarcomas. Strikingly, moderate to 
strong expression of both the Tie2 receptor and its agonist ligand, Ang1, was 
observed in > 80% of human samples (6). To extend these observations, the effects 
of VEGFR and Tie2 antagonism on angiosarcoma growth were assessed in vitro and 
in mouse xenograft models (7). As hypothesized, a highly selective Tie2 receptor 
tyrosine kinase inhibitor inhibited tumor cell proliferation in vitro and tumor growth in 
vivo. Moreover, the Tie2 antagonist displayed synergistic antiproliferative activity 
when combined with a VEGFR antagonist in a model of aggressive, high-grade 
angiosarcoma. More recently, stable and selective knock-down of the Tie2 receptor 
has been shown to reduce angiosarcoma cell proliferation in vitro and potently inhibit 
tumor growth in vivo (Kozak, unpublished results). These data strongly suggest 
concurrent, potent inhibition of VEGFR and Tie2 represents an attractive therapeutic 
strategy in angiosarcoma.
Regorafenib displays  potent VEGFR inhibition with IC 50s generally half that observed 
with sorafenib. Moreover, regorafenib displays approximately 10-fold greater potency 
against the Tie2 receptor (as assessed in cellular kinase activity assays) compared to 
sorafenib (8,9). Beyond these favorable characteristics, regorafenib also possesses 
far greater activity than sorafenib (and other related TKIs) against additional potential 
targets in angiosarcoma including PDGFRs, RAF, KIT and FGFR (9). Taken together, 
these data raise the possibility that regorafenib will have considerable activity in the 
treatment of angiosarcoma.IC 50
The proposed  single-arm phase II trial will assess progression-free survival at 4 
months as the primary efficacy endpoint. If this trial meets efficacy criteria, it would be 
prudent for subsequent phase III or other large-scale confirmatory trials to employ an 
interim analysis to provide a double-check on the efficacy results.
1.3 REGORAFENIB
Regorafenib is a  small molecule inhibitor of multiple membrane-bound and 
intracellular kinases involved in normal cellular functions and in pathologic processes 
such as oncogenesis, tumor angiogenesis, and maintenance of the tumor 
microenvironment (9,10). In in vitro biochemical or cellular assays, regorafenib or its 
major human active metabolites M-2 and M-5 inhibited the activity of RET, VEGFR1, 
VEGFR2, VEGFR3, KIT, PDGFR-alpha, PDGFR-beta, FGFR1, FGFR2, TIE2, DDR2, 
Trk2A, Eph2A, RAF-1, BRAF, BRAFV600E, SAPK2, PTK5, and Ab1 at
concentrations of  regorafenib that have been achieved clinically. In in vivo models, 
regorafenib demonstrated anti-angiogenic activity in a rat tumor model, and inhibition 
of tumor growth as well as anti-metastatic activity in several mouse xenograft models 
including some for human colorectal carcinoma. Regorafenib activity corresponds to 
long-lasting anti-angiogenic activity as measured by dynamic contrast enhanced 
(DCE) – magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
1.3.1Preclinical  experience
In vivo,  regorafenib exhibited anti-angiogenic and anti-proliferative effects in 
human colon and breast xenografts as demonstrated by a reduction in 
microvessel area, reduced Ki-67 staining, and reduced pERK1/2 staining in 
tissue sections from tumor xenografts, and dose-dependent inhibition of

8 Version Date:April 3, 2019growth in  multiple xenograft models (breast, colon, renal, NSCLC, melanoma, 
pancreatic, thyroid, ovarian). (9) Immunohistochemical ex-vivo studies with a 
phospho –specific monoclonal anti-ERK 1 / 2 antibody demonstrated inhibition 
of the MAPK pathway five days after treatment with regorafenib in 2 of 3
tumor models  examined (MDA-MB 231 and BxPC-3), but not in NSCLC 
(H460).
In addition,  all tested human tumor xenografts (MDA-MB-231, H460, BxPC-3 
and Colo-205) demonstrated a significant reduction in new blood vessels by 
histomorphometry as detected in tumor samples using a murine CD31 
antibody. (9) These data suggest that regorafenib can target the tumor cell 
MAPK pathway  (tumor  cell survival)  and tumor vasculature  in some but not all 
tumors.
1.3.2Clinical experience
Two phase  III global randomized studies have evaluated the efficacy of 
regorafenib. The CORRECT (Patients with metastatic colorectal cancer 
treated with  regorafenib or placebo after failure of standard therapy) trial is an 
international, multicenter,  randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study 
that enrolled 760 patients with mCRC whose disease has progressed after 
approved standard therapies (11). Metastatic colorectal cancer patients were 
randomized to regorafenib plus best supportive care (BSC) or placebo plus 
BSC. Treatment cycles consisted of 160 mg of regorafenib (or matching 
placebo) once daily for three weeks on / one week off plus BSC. The primary 
endpoint of this trial was overall survival. Secondary endpoints included 
progression-free survival, objective tumor response rate and disease control 
rate. The safety and tolerability of the two treatment groups were also 
compared.
At a  preplanned second interim analysis, there was a statistically significant 
survival benefit for regorafenib. The estimated hazard ratio for overall survival 
was 0.773 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.635 to 0.941; 1-sided p = .0051). 
Patients treated with regorafenib had a median overall survival of 6.4 months, 
compared with 5.0 months for placebo — a 29% increase in survival. In 
addition to improved overall survival, progression-free survival was superior; 
median progression-free survival was 1.9 months (95% CI, 1.88 to 2.17) for
regorafenib and  1.7 months (95% CI, 1.68 to 1.74) for placebo. The estimated
hazard ratio  for progression-free survival was 0.493 (95% CI, 0.418 to 0.581; 
1-sided p< .000001). There was a substantial difference in disease control 
rate in the regorafenib and placebo groups (44% vs. 15%; p<.000001).
Regorafenib demonstrated  comparable efficacy benefits across patient 
subgroups analyzed including age, number of mets, number of lines of prior 
therapy, and kras status.
The most  frequent grade 3+ adverse events in the regorafenib group were 
hand–foot skin reaction (17%), fatigue (15%), diarrhea (8%), 
hyperbilirubinemia (8%), and hypertension (7%). The efficacy and safety from 
the CORRECT study supported FDA approval in September 2012.
The efficacy and  safety of regorafenib were examined in the Phase III GRID 
trial in patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) who had 
exhausted all other treatment options (12). The study involved 199 patients 
with metastatic and/or unresectable GIST that had become resistant to 
imatinib and sunitinib. Patients were randomized 2:1 to regorafenib (160 mg

supportive care.
The results showed  that treatment with regorafenib led to a statistically 
significant 3.9-month improvement in progression-free survival
(PFS), compared with  placebo (4.8 months vs. 0.9 months; hazard ratio [HR]
= 0.27;  p <.0001). Overall survival was statistically similar between groups as 
expected due to a trial design that allowed crossover to regorafenib for 
disease progression. The median survival period without tumor growth 
among patients on regorafenib was 4.8 months while for the control group on 
placebo it was less than a month. The overall disease control rate combining 
partial responses with durable stable disease for at least 12 weeks was 53% 
with regorafenib compared with 9% in the control group. The most common 
grade ≥3 adverse events associated with regorafenib were hand-foot skin 
reaction (56.1%), hypertension (48.5%), and diarrhea (40.9%). GRID study 
data recently prompted FDA approval of regorafenib for treatment of 
previously treated patients with locally advanced, unresectable or metastatic 
GIST.

TREATMENT PLAN
4.1 OVERVIEW
The eligible  study population will consist of adult patients with histologically confirmed, 
measurable, unresectable or metastatic angiosarcoma who have progressive disease 
after prior treatment with ifosfamide, doxorubicin or a taxane. Patients will be treated 
with daily oral regorafenib (160 mg) for 3 weeks on followed by 1 week off (1 cycle = 4 
weeks). Patients will continue treatment until disease progression or withdrawal due 
to unacceptable toxicity. Once off-treatment, patients will be followed for overall 
survival up to 5 years. An optimal two-stage Simon design will be employed. The first 
stage will include 12 patients. If > 3 patients achieve a PFS > 4 months, an additional 
19 patients will be enrolled for a total of 31 patients.
4.2 TREATMENT ADMINISTRATION
Regorafenib will be administered  orally at a dose of 160 mg regorafenib for 3 weeks 
on followed by 1 week off. One cycle is 4 weeks (28 days). Patients will be instructed 
to take 4 40mg regorafenib tables every morning with approximately 8 fluid ounces 
(240 mL) of water after a low-fat (< 30% fat) breakfast. Patients will be given 
examples of low fat breakfasts, such as:
•Two slices of white toast with 1 tablespoon of low-fat margarine and 1 tablespoon 
of jelly and 8 ounces (240 mL) of skim milk (approximately 319 calories and 8.2 g 
of fat).
•One cup of cereal (i.e. Special K), 8 ounces (240 mL) of skim milk, one piece of 
toast with jam (no butter or marmalade), apple juice, and one cup of coffee or tea 
(2 g fat, 17 g protein, 93 g of carbohydrate, 520 calories).

13 Version Date:April 3, 20194.3 DOSE MODIFICATION & MANAGEMENT OF TOXICITY
4.3.1Dose Reductions/Re-escalations
The starting dose  of regorafenib is 160 mg once daily. Study medication will 
be administered on a schedule of 3 weeks on followed by 1week off (1 cycle = 
4 weeks). Doses will be delayed or reduced for clinically significant 
hematologic and non-hematologic toxicities that are related to protocol 
therapy according to the guidelines shown in Table 1 below. Dose 
modifications will follow predefined dose levels. Dose adjustments for 
hematologic toxicity are based on the blood counts obtained in preparation for 
the day of  treatment.
NOTE: In  some cases, dose re-escalation may be permitted at the discretion 
of the treating investigator. Please refer to the tables below for details 
regarding when this is acceptable and under what conditions.
Table 1: Pre-defined dose  modification levels
Dose Level Dose # of  Regorafenib Tablets
Dose level  0 1160 mg  PO qd 4 40mg  tablets
Dose level  - 1 120 mg  PO qd 3 40-mg tablets
Dose level  - 2 80 mg  PO qd 2 40-mg tablets
1 Standard starting dose
If a subject  experiences more than one toxicity, dose reduction should be 
according to the toxicity with the highest grade unless that toxicity is 
unequivocally deemed not to be causally related to study treatment. In such 
cases, the investigator may dose reduce according to the toxicity deemed 
most causally related to study treatment.

17 Version Date: April 3rd, 2019Control of  calluses
Before initiating  treatment with regorafenib:
•Check condition of hands and feet.
•Suggest a manicure/pedicure, when indicated.
•Recommend pumice stone use for callus or
‘rough spot’ removal.
During regorafenib treatment:
•Avoid pressure  points.
•Avoid items that rub, pinch or create friction.
Use of creams
•Non-urea based creams may be applied liberally.
•Keratolytic creams (e.g. urea-based creams, salicylic acid 6%) may be used sparingly 
and only to affected (hyperkeratotic) areas.
•Alpha  hydroxyl acids (AHA) based creams may be applied liberally 2 times a day. 
Approximately
5% to 8% provides gentle  chemical exfoliation.
•Topical analgesics (e.g. lidocaine 2%) are to be considered for pain  control.
•Topical corticosteroids like clobetasol 0.05% 
should be considered for subjects with Grade 2 or 
3 HFSR. Avoid systemic steroids.
Tender areas  should be protected as follows:
•Use socks/gloves to cover moisturizing creams
•Wear well-padded footwear
•Use insole cushions or inserts (e.g. silicon, gel)
•Foot soaks with tepid water and Epson  salts
4.3.3Management and Dose Modifications for Hypertension
Hypertension is  a known AE associated with regorafenib treatment. Subjects will have their blood pressure 
measured at least weekly at the study site during the first 6 weeks of treatment. If additional blood  pressure 
measurements are done outside the study site, and the blood pressure is >
140 mm  Hg systolic or > 90 mm Hg diastolic, then the subject will be instructed to contact study personnel. The 
management of hypertension,
including the  choice of antihypertensive medication, will be performed
according to  local institutional standards and to the usual practice of the investigator. Every effort should be made to 
control blood pressure by medical means other than study drug dose modification. If necessary, Table 5 outlines

For patients  with observed worsening of serum liver tests considered related to regorafenib (i.e. where no alternative 
cause is evident, such as post-hepatic cholestasis or disease progression), the dose modification and monitoring 
advice in Table 6 should be followed.
Regorafenib is a  UGT1A1 inhibitor. Mild, indirect (unconjugated) hyperbilirubinemia may occur in patients with Gilbert’s 
syndrome.

Version D April 3rd 2019 204.3.5Prevention/Management Strategies for Diarrhea
Diarrhea can  be a common side effect of regorafenib. The 
preventive/management strategies for diarrhea should be consistent with local 
institutional standards (e.g., anti-diarrheals and optimized hydration status).
Anti-diarrhea medications  may be introduced if symptoms occur. Previous 
trials have shown that the diarrhea could be managed with loperamide. The 
recommended dose of loperamide is 4 mg at first onset, followed by 2 mg 
every 2 to 4 hours until diarrhea-free for 12 hours.
4.4 PRIOR  AND CONCOMITANT THERAPY
All medication  that is considered necessary for the subject’s welfare, and which is not 
expected to interfere with the evaluation of the study treatment, may be given at the 
discretion of the investigator. All medications (including contrast media) taken within 2 
weeks prior to the start of the study and during the study must be recorded in the 
subject’s source documentation and in the appropriate eCRF (including start/stop 
dates, dose frequency, route of administration, and indication).
Co-administration of a  strong CYP3A4 inducer (rifampin) with a single  160 mg dose of 
regorafenib decreased the mean exposure of regorafenib, increased the mean 
exposure of the active metabolite M-5, and resulted in no change in the mean 
exposure of the active metabolite M-2. Avoid concomitant use of regorafenib with 
strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g. rifampin, phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, 
and St. John’s Wort)
Co administration  of a strongCYP3A4 inhibitor (ketoconazole) with a single 160mg 
dose of regorafenib increased the mean exposure of regorafenib and decreased the 
mean exposure of the active metabolites M-2 and M-5. Avoid concomitant use of 
regorafenib with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 activity (e.g. clarithromycin, grapefruit 
juice, itraconazole, ketoconazole, nefazadone, posaconazole, telithromycin, and 
voriconazole).
4.4.1Permitted Concomitant Therapies
•Standard therapies for concurrent medical  conditions.
•Supportive care for any underlying illness.
•Palliative radiation therapy is allowed if the target lesion(s) are not 
included within the radiation field and no more than 30% of total bone 
marrow is irradiated to a total of 20 Gy (EQD2). Protocol treatment 
should be held 7 days before, during and 7 days after palliative radiation, 
or at the discretion of the site radiation oncologist. Palliative radiation 
cannot include target lesions.
•Palliative surgery: Protocol treatment should be held 7 days before and 
until the wound is healed. If treatment is not resumed within 3 weeks, the 
case will be reviewed by QAM and PI to determine whether or not subject 
can restart treatment. Palliative surgery cannot include surgery on target 
lesions.
•Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and other hematopoietic 
growth factors may be used in the management of acute toxicity, such as 
febrile neutropenia, when clinically indicated or at the investigator’s 
discretion. However, they may not be substituted for a required dose 
reduction. Subjects are permitted to take chronic  erythropoietin.

vitamin/mineral supplements are permitted provided that they do not 
interfere with the study endpoints, in the opinion of the investigator.
•Bisphosphonates
•Subjects who are prophylactically treated with an agent such as warfarin 
or heparin will be allowed to participate. Close monitoring (day 1 of each 
cycle) is  mandatory. NOTE: Therapeutic  doses of anti-coagulants are not 
permitted.
4.4.2Concomitant Therapies Not Permitted:
•Other investigational treatment during study  treatment.
•Prior use of sorafenib.
•Use of cytotoxic  chemotherapy within 21 days of registration.
•Use of targeted therapy  within two half-lives  of registration.
•Radiation directed at target lesion within 28 days of registration.
•Concurrent systemic antitumor therapy, including cytotoxic therapy, signal 
transduction inhibitors, immunotherapy, and hormonal therapy.
•Bone marrow transplant or stem cell rescue.
•Subjects  taking narrow  therapeutic index medications should be monitored 
proactively (e.g. phenytoin, quinidine, carbamazepine, Phenobarbital, 
cyclosporin, and digoxin). NOTE: Warfarin is metabolized by the 
cytochrome enzyme CYP2C9 and it’s levels may be especially affected by 
regorafenib; therefore, only prophylactic  doses of warfarin  are permitted.
•Use of drugs that induce CYP3A4 including (but not limited to):
oGlucocorticoids (cortisone, hydrocortisone, prednisone, 
methylprednisone, dexamethasone)
oAnticonvulsants (phenytoin, carbarnazepine,  phenobarbital, 
oxcarbazepine)

oAntibiotics (rifampin, rifabutin, rifapentine)
oSt. John’s Wort
oModafinil
oPioglitazone
4.8 STUDY DURATION AND WITHDRAWAL CRITERIA
Patients will  continue treatment until disease progression or development of 
unacceptable toxicity. In addition, patients may be discontinued from treatment and/or 
withdrawn from the study for other reasons, as outlined below. Any subject removed 
from the trial will remain under medical supervision until discharge or transfer is 
medically acceptable. In all cases, the reason for withdrawal must be recorded in the 
appropriate eCRF and in the subject's medical records. Patients will be followed once 
off-treatment for up to 5 years for overall survival endpoints.
4.8.1Mandatory Withdrawal Criteria
Subjects must  be withdrawn from the trial (treatment and procedures) for 
the following reasons:
•Subject  withdraws consent from study treatment and study procedures. A 
subject must be removed from the trial at his/her own request or at the 
request of his/her legally acceptable representative. At any time during 
the trial and without giving reasons, a subject may decline to participate 
further. The subject will not suffer any disadvantage as a result.

Version D April 3rd 2019 22•Pregnancy. Pregnancy will be reported within the same timelines as an 
SAE, although a pregnancy per se is not considered an SAE. NOTE: 
subjects who have been withdrawn from treatment with study drug 
because of pregnancy  should not undergo CT scans [with contrast]/MRI 
or bone scans while pregnant.
•The investigator concludes  that continuation of the trial would be harmful 
to the subject's  well-being.
•Subject is lost to  follow-up.
•Death occurs.
4.8.2Possible Withdrawal  Criteria
Subjects may  be withdrawn from the study for any of the following reasons:
•The subject is non-compliant with study drug, trial procedures, or both; 
including the use of anti-cancer therapy not prescribed by the study 
protocol. Subject compliance with the treatment and protocol includes 
willingness to comply with all aspects of the protocol, and to have blood 
collected for all safety evaluations. At the discretion of the investigator, a 
subject may be discontinued  from the  trial for non-compliance with follow- 
up visits or study drug.
•Severe allergic reaction to regorafenib (such as exfoliative erythroderma 
or Grade 3 or 4 hypersensitivity reaction).
•The development of a second cancer.
•Development of an intercurrent illness or situation which would, in the 
judgment of the investigator, significantly affect  assessments of clinical 
status and trial  endpoints.
•Deterioration of ECOG performance status to 4.
•Use of illicit drugs or other substances that may, in the opinion of the 
investigator, have a reasonable chance of contributing to toxicity or 
otherwise skewing trial  result.

6.1 DEFINITIONS AND RESPONSE  CRITERIA
Response and  progression will be evaluated using the international criteria proposed 
by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v 1.1 Committee.
Changes in  only the largest diameter (unidimensional measurement) of the tumor 
lesions are used in RECIST v 1.1.
Note: Lesions  are either measurable or non-measurable using the criteria provided 
below. The term “evaluable” in reference to measurability will not be used because it 
does not provide additional meaning or accuracy.
6.1.1Measurable and non-measurable disease
Measurable tumor  lesions are defined as those that can be accurately 
measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as ≥ 10 
mm on CT (with less than 5 mm slice thickness) or ≥ 10 mm by caliper 
measurement during clinical examination. For superficial lesions measured by 
caliper, documentation by color photography including a ruler in the field of 
view is strongly recommended. MRI may be used in clinically appropriate 
circumstances to measure tumor lesions. Measurable lymph nodes are 
defined as those that can be accurately measured as > 15 mm in short axis 
when assessed  by CT.
Lesions failing  to reach size criteria above and those that are not reproducibly 
measurable including leptomeningeal disease, effusions/ascites, inflammatory 
breast disease, diffuse lymphangitic disease and blastic bone lesions are 
defined as non-measurable. Previously irradiated lesions will also be 
considered non-measurable except if unequivocal progression is documented 
and radiation was greater than 28 days prior to study entry.
6.1.2Target and non-target lesions
All measurable  lesions up to a maximum of two lesions per organ and 5 
lesions in total, representative of all involved organs, should be identified as 
target lesions and recorded and measured at baseline. Target lesions 
should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest 
diameter) and their suitability for accurate repeated measurements (either by 
imaging techniques or clinically). A sum of the diameter for all target lesions 
(long axis for tumor  lesions and short axis for lymph nodes, if included) will be 
calculated and reported as the baseline sum diameters. The baseline sum 
diameters will be used as reference by which to characterize the objective 
tumor response.
All other  lesions (or sites of disease) should be identified as non-target 
lesions and should also be recorded at baseline. Non-target lesions include 
measurable lesions that exceed the maximum numbers per organ or total of 
all involved organs as well as non-measurable lesions. Measurements of 
these lesions are not required but the presence or absence of each should be 
noted.
6.1.3Guidelines for evaluation of  response
Target lesion measurements should  be obtained at baseline (within 4 weeks 
from initiation of regorafenib). Repeat measurements will be performed using 
the same technique  as that used at baseline.  For each measurement,  a sum

26 Version Date: April 3rd, 2019of diameters  will be calculated and non-target lesions will be followed as 
“present”, “absent” or in rare cases “unequivocal progression.”
6.1.3.1Target lesion  responses
Target lesions  will be evaluated as follows:
6.1.3.1.1 Complete response (CR): Disappearance of all 
target lesions
6.1.3.1.2 Partial response (PR): > 30% decrease in the 
baseline sum  diameters of target  lesions
6.1.3.1.3 Stable disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to 
qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, 
taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while 
on study
6.1.3.1.4 Progressive disease (PD): > 20% increase in the 
sum diameters  of target lesions, taking as reference 
the smallest sum diameters while on study. The sum 
diameters must also demonstrate an absolute 
increase of 5 mm. The appearance of one or more 
new lesions also qualifies as PD.
6.1.3.2Non-target lesions responses:
Non-target lesions  will be evaluated as follows:
6.1.3.2.1 Complete response (CR): Disappearance of all non- 
target lesions with all lymph nodes < 10 mm in short 
axis.
6.1.3.2.2 Non-CR/Non-PD: Persistence of one or more non- 
target lesions
6.1.3.2.3 Progressive disease (PD): Unequivocal  progression 
of non-target lesions (meriting discontinuation of 
regorafenib). The appearance of one or more new 
lesions also qualifies as PD.
6.1.4Evaluation of best overall response
The best  overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the 
treatment until the end of treatment taking into account requirements for 
confirmation. Please refer to Table 8 below.
Table 7: Evaluation  of Best Overall Response
Target Lesions Non-Target Lesions New Lesions Overall Response

27 Version Date: April 3rd, 2019should be  classified as having “symptomatic deterioration.” Every effort 
should be made to document the objective progression, even after 
discontinuation of treatment.
6.1.5Confirmatory Measurement/Duration of Response
6.1.5.1Confirmation
To be  assigned a status of confirmed PR or CR, changes in tumor 
measurements must be confirmed by repeat assessment no less than 
4 weeks after the criteria for response are first met. In the case of SD, 
follow-up measurements must have met the SD criteria at least once 
after study entry at a minimum interval of 8 weeks.
6.1.5.2Duration of overall response/stable disease
The duration of  overall response is measured from the time that 
measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever is recorded 
first) until the first date that recurrent or progressive disease is 
objectively documented (taking as reference for progressive disease 
the smallest measurements recorded since treatment started).
The duration of  overall CR is measured from the time that 
measurement criteria are first met for CR until the date that recurrent 
disease is objectively documented.
Stable disease  is measured from the start of the treatment until the 
criteria for progression are met, taking as reference the smallest 
measurements recorded since treatment started.
6.2PRIMARY ENDPOINT ASSESSMENT
The primary  endpoint of the study will be progression-free survival (PFS) at 4 months, 
defined as the absence of progression at 4 months. Patients must complete at least 2 
cycles of study treatment to be considered evaluable for this endpoint.
6.3SECONDARY ENDPOINT  ASSESSMENT
The progression-free  rate (PFR) at 3 and 6 months will be defined as the number of 
patients with progression absent at these timepoints divided by the total number of 
study patients. Median PFS (defined as the duration of time from start of treatment 
until time of progression or death, whichever occurs first) will be estimated as a 
secondary endpoint. Overall survival will be defined as the time from start of treatment 
until death by any cause. Response rate (by RECIST v 1.1) will be calculated using 
the definitions above. The rate and duration of tumor control will be defined as the 
number of CR+PR+SD responses. Patients must complete at least 2 cycles of study 
treatment to be considered evaluable for efficacy endpoints.
To evaluate the  safety and tolerability of regorafenib, all subjects who receive at least 
one dose of study treatment will be considered evaluable for the safety analysis.
Safety variables  will include the following: AEs, laboratory changes (complete blood 
counts, electrolytes, chemistry, and coagulation), changes in vital signs (blood 
pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and temperature) and results of clinically 
indicated studies outside study guidance, such as ECG or chest x-ray images, as 
produced at the investigator’s discretion. All AEs whether considered drug-related or 
not, will be reported with a diagnosis, start/stop dates, action taken, whether treatment

28 Version Date: April 3rd, 2019was discontinued, any  corrective measures taken, outcome, and other possible 
causes. For all events, the relationship to treatment and the intensity of the event will 
be determined by the investigator. All observations pertinent to the safety of the study 
treatment will be recorded and included in the final report. This trial will use the NCI 
CTCAE v 4.0 criteria for assessment of toxicity and SAE reporting with regard to 
toxicity grade.
ADVERSE EVENTS  AND SAFETY MONITORING
This study  will be conducted in compliance with the Data Safety Monitoring Plan (DSMP) of 
the Robert H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center of Northwestern University (please refer to 
Appendices for additional information). The level of risk attributed to this study requires High 
Intensity Monitoring, as outlined in the DSMP. In addition, the study will abide by all safety 
reporting regulations, as set forth in the Code of Federal Regulations and as required by the 
NCI AdEERS Reporting Guidelines.
Investigators should  refer to the Safety Information section of the current IB for regorafenib, 
including the DCSI (development core safety information), for the expected side effects of 
regorafenib. As with any agent, there is always the potential for unexpected AEs, including 
hypersensitivity reactions. The IB will be updated if any new relevant safety data are 
obtained.
7.1 ADVERSE EVENT  MONITORING
Adverse event data  collection and reporting, which are required as part of every 
clinical trial, are done to ensure the safety of subjects enrolled in the studies as well 
as those who will enroll in future studies using similar agents. Subjects must be 
carefully monitored for AEs. This monitoring also includes clinical laboratory tests. 
Adverse events should be assessed in terms of their seriousness, intensity, and 
relationship to the study drug, or other chemotherapy/treatment. Adverse events are 
reported in a routine manner at scheduled times during a trial. Additionally, certain 
adverse events must be reported in an expedited manner to allow for optimal 
monitoring of patient safety and care.
All patients experiencing  an adverse event, regardless of its relationship to study 
drug, will be monitored until:
•the adverse event resolves  or the symptoms  or signs that constitute the 
adverse event return to baseline;
•any abnormal laboratory values have returned to baseline;
•there is a satisfactory explanation  other than the study drug for the changes 
observed; or
•death  occurs.
Therapeutic monitoring should  be performed following dose modification of 
regorafenib in a manner consistent with the local clinical standard of care. In general, 
subjects should be closely monitored for side effects of all concomitant medications 
regardless of the path of drug elimination.
7.2 DEFINITIONS & DESCRIPTIONS
7.2.1Adverse event  (AE)
An adverse  event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient 
receiving study treatment and which does not necessarily have a causal

 UniversityLead Site Study Number: NU 13S02 
Bayer Healthcare Study Number: ONC-2013-129
29 Version Date: April 3rd, 2019relationship with  this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and 
unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or 
disease temporally associated with the use of an experimental intervention, 
whether or not related to the intervention.
7.2.2Severity of AEs
All adverse  events will be graded according to the NCI Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse  Events (CTCAE) version 4.0. The CTCAE  v. 4 is available 
at http://ctep.cancer.gov/reporting/ctc.html.
If no  CTCAE grading is available, the severity of an AE is graded as follows:
7.2.2.1Mild (grade 1): the event  causes discomfort without disruption  of 
normal daily  activities.
7.2.2.2Moderate (grade 2): the event causes discomfort that affects normal 
daily activities.
7.2.2.3Severe (grade 3): the event makes the patient unable to perform 
normal daily activities  or significantly affects  his/her clinical  status.
7.2.2.4Life-threatening  (grade 4): the patient was at risk of death  at the time 
of the  event.
7.2.2.5Fatal (grade 5): the event caused death.
7.2.3Serious adverse events (SAEs)
All SAEs,  regardless of attribution, occurring during the study or within 30 
days of the last administration of study drug must be reported upon discovery 
or occurrence. Additional expedited or routine reporting may be required, 
depending on the nature of the SAE (as outlined in 7.3 below). A “serious” 
adverse event is defined in regulatory terminology as any untoward medical 
occurrence that:
7.2.3.1Results in death.
If death  results from (progression of) the disease, the disease should 
be reported as event (SAE) itself.
7.2.3.2Is life-threatening.
The patient  was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not 
refer to an event that hypothetically might have caused death if it were 
more severe.
7.2.3.3Requires in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing 
hospitalization for  ≥ 24hours.
7.2.3.4Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity.
7.2.3.5Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect.
7.2.3.6Is an important medical  event.
Any event  that does not meet the above criteria, but that in the 
judgment of the investigator jeopardizes the patient, may be 
considered for reporting as a serious adverse event. The event may 
require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed in the definition of “Serious Adverse Event“.
Examples: allergic bronchospasm  requiring intensive treatment in an 
emergency room or at home; convulsions that may not result in 
hospitalization; development of drug abuse or drug dependency.
7.2.4Medical History vs. Adverse Event
7.2.4.1A surgical procedure  that was planned prior to the start of the study 
by any physician treating the subject should not be recorded as AE

30 Version Date: April 3rd, 2019(however, the  condition for which the surgery is required may be an 
AE if worsens compared to baseline).
7.2.4.2Conditions that started  before  registration and for which no symptoms 
or treatment are present until after registration are recorded as 
medical history  (e.g. seasonal allergy without acute  complaints).
7.2.4.3Conditions that started  before  registration and for which  symptoms or 
treatment are present after registration, at unchanged intensity, are 
recorded as medical history (e.g. allergic pollinosis).
7.2.4.4Conditions that started or deteriorated after registration will be 
documented as adverse events.
7.2.5Exceptions to the Definition of SAE
Certain hospitalizations  or prolongation of hospitalizations should not be 
considered SAEs, including those that meeting the following criteria:
7.2.5.1An admission resulting in a hospital stay of less than 12 hours.
7.2.5.2An admission that is pre-planned (i.e. elective or scheduled surgery 
arranged prior to the start of the study).
7.2.5.3An admission that is not associated with an AE (i.e.  social 
hospitalization for purposes of respite  care).
7.2.6Unanticipated Problems Involving Risks to Subjects or Others (UPIRSO)
A UPIRSO includes events that meet  ALL of the following criteria:
7.3.3.1.1 Are unanticipated in terms of nature, severity, or 
frequency;
7.3.3.1.2 Place the research subject or others at a different or 
greater risk of harm; AND
7.3.3.1.3 Are deemed to be related or possibly related to 
participation in the study.
7.3 ADVERSE EVENT  REPORTING
7.3.1Routine  Reporting
All routine  adverse events, such as those that are expected, or are unlikely or 
definitely not related to study participation, are to be reported on the 
appropriate eCRF according to the time intervals noted in the Schedule of 
Events. Routine AEs will be reviewed by the Data Monitoring Committee 
(DMC) according to the study’s phase and risk level, as outlined in the DSMP.
7.3.2Steps to determine if expedited reporting is required
This includes  all events that occur within 30 days of the last dose of protocol 
treatment. Any event that occurs more than 30 days after the last dose of 
treatment and is attributed (possibly, probably, or definitely) to the agent(s) 
must also be reported accordingly.
7.3.2.1Identify the type of adverse event using the NCI CTCAE v 4.0.
7.3.2.2Grade the adverse event using the NCI CTCAE v 4.0.
7.3.2.3Determine  whether the adverse event  is related to the protocol 
therapy.
Attribution categories  are as follows:
7.3.2.3.1 Definite: AE is clearly related to the study treatment.
7.3.2.3.2 Probable: AE is likely related to the study treatment.
7.3.2.3.3 Possible: AE may be related to the study treatment.

treatment.
7.3.2.4Determine the prior experience of the adverse event.
Expected events  are those that have been previously identified as 
resulting from administration of the agent. An adverse event is 
considered unexpected, for expedited reporting purposes only, when 
either the type of event or the severity of the event is not listed in:
7.3.2.4.1 the current protocol;
7.3.2.4.2 the drug package insert;
7.3.2.4.3 the current Investigator’s Brochure.
7.3.3Documentation of  AEs
Each event should  be described in detail along with start and stop dates, 
severity, relationship to regorafenib, action taken and outcome.
Any action  on study treatment to resolve the AE is to be documented on the 
appropriate eCRF using the categories listed below:
•Drug withdrawn
•Drug interrupted
•Dose reduced
•Dose not changed
•Dose increased
•Not applicable
•Unknown
In addition,  the outcome of the AE is to be documented as follows:
•Recovered/resolved
•Recovering/resolving
•Recovered/resolved with sequelae
•Not recovered/not resolved
•Fatal
•Unknown
7.3.4Expedited Reporting of SAEs
Completion of  the Medwatch form is the preferred method of reporting. This 
form can be found at: http://www.fda.gov/medwatch/.
7.3.4.1Reporting to the Northwestern University  QAM/DMC
All SAEs  must be reported to the assigned QAM within 24 hours of 
becoming aware of the event. Completion of the NU CRO SAE Form, 
provided as a separate document, is required.
The completed  form should assess whether or not the event qualifies 
as a UPIRSO. The report should also include:
•Protocol description and number(s)
•The patient’s identification number
•A description of the event, severity, treatment, and outcome (if 
known)
•Supportive laboratory results and diagnostics
•The hospital discharge summary (if available/applicable)

7.3.4.2Reporting to the IRB
The following information  pertains to the responsibilities of the lead 
site (Northwestern University). Additional participating sites should 
follow their local IRB guidelines for reporting to their local IRBs.
•Any death of an NU subject that is unanticipated in nature and at 
least possibly related  to study participation will be promptly 
reported to the NU IRB within 24 hours of notification.
•Any death of an NU subject that is actively on study treatment 
(regardless of whether or not the event is possibly related to 
study treatment)
•Any death of a non-NU subject that is unanticipated and at least 
possibly related and  any other UPIRSOs will be reported to the 
NU IRB  within 5 working days of notification.
•All other deaths of NU subjects not previously reported, other 
non-NU subject  deaths that were unanticipated and unrelated, 
and any  other SAEs that were not previously reported as 
UPIRSOs will be reported  to the NU IRB at the time of annual 
continuing review.
7.3.4.3Reporting to the FDA
This applies  to studies conducted under an IND or IDE, as set forth in 
the Code of Federal Regulations, Section 312.32
The FDA  will be notified within 7 calendar days of any SAE that is 
associated with study treatment, is unexpected, and is fatal or life- 
threatening.
The FDA will  be notified within 15 calendar days of any SAE that is 
associated with the study treatment, unexpected, and serious but not 
fatal or life-threatening. This includes any previous SAEs that were 
not initially deemed reportable, but are later determined to meet the 
criteria for reporting (i.e. by the DMC).
All other  SAEs will be reported on an annual basis as part of the 
annual FDA report.
7.3.4.4Reporting to Bayer  HealthCare
Investigators should  report SAEs to Bayer using one of the following

The investigator  must report to Bayer any pregnancy occurring in a study 
subject, or in his partner, during the subject’s participation in this study. The 
report should be submitted within the same timelines as an SAE, although a 
pregnancy per se is not considered an SAE. For a study subject, the outcome 
of the pregnancy should be followed up carefully, and any abnormal outcome 
of the mother or the child should be reported. For the pregnancy of a study 
subject’s partner, all efforts should be made to obtain similar information on 
course and outcome, subject to the partner’s consent. For all reports, the 
forms provided are to be used.

STATISTICAL METHODS  AND DETERMINATION OF SAMPLE SIZE
9.1 PRIMARY OUTCOME OF INTEREST
The primary  endpoint will be progression-free survival at 4 months. Standard of care 
therapy currently provides a median PFS of about 3 months with a SD of 
approximately 2.5 months.
9.2 SECONDARY OUTCOMES OF INTEREST
Secondary endpoints  of interest will include progression free rates at 3 and 6 months, 
median PFS, overall survival, response rates, duration of responses, rates of stable 
disease, safety and tolerability. Standard of care therapy currently provides a median 
overall survival of about 9 months with a SD of approximately 4 months.
9.3 TRIAL DESIGN AND DETERMINATION OF SAMPLE SIZE
A two-stage  optimal Simon design  will be employed to test the null hypothesis  that the 
probability of progression-free survival of 4 months or greater (P) is < 0.22 versus the 
alternative that the  probability > 0.45. To test this hypothesis with adequate power, a 
first stage  involving 12 patients will be completed. If > 3 patients achieve progression- 
free survival of 4 months, the trial will be continued for a total of 31 patients. If > 11 
out of 31 patients  achieve progression-free survival  of 4 months, the trial will reject the 
hypothesis that P < 0.22 and conclude that P > 0.45,
To determine  sample size, the following parameters were employed: P0 = 0.22, P1 = 
0.45, α = 0.05 and β = 0.20. Computations originally performed using software PASS 
(www.ncss.com).

9.4 PLANNED ANALYSES
Survival data  will be analyzed using parametric (exponential) and non-parametric 
(Kaplan-Meier) methods. Exact methods for providing confidence intervals for 
proportions “surviving” landmarks will be used as needed. Statistical software will be 
SAS (and others as merited) and analysis will be conducted under the supervision of 
Alfred Rademaker, PhD, in the Biostatistical Core Facility at Northwestern University.
Descriptive statistics  (mean, standard  deviation, mean change from baseline,  etc.) will 
be presented for laboratory values. Detailed examination of AEs by NCI CTCAE 
grade and frequency tabulation will be presented. Missing data for partial dates on 
AEs or concomitant medications may be imputed.
STUDY MANAGEMENT
10.1INSTITUTIONAL REVIEW BOARD (IRB) APPROVAL AND CONSENT
It is  expected that the IRB will have the proper representation and function in 
accordance with federally mandated regulations. The IRB should approve the consent 
form and protocol.
In obtaining  and documenting informed consent, the investigator should comply with 
the applicable  regulatory requirement(s),  and should adhere  to Good Clinical  Practice 
(GCP) and to ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
Before recruitment  and enrollment onto this study, the patient will be given a full 
explanation of the study  and will be given  the opportunity to review the consent form. 
Each consent form must include all the relevant elements currently required by the 
FDA Regulations and local or state regulations. Once this essential information has 
been provided to the patient and the investigator is assured that the patient 
understands the implications of participating in the study, the patient will be asked to 
give consent to participate in the study by signing an IRB approved consent  form.
Prior to a  patient’s participation in the trial, the written informed consent form should 
be signed and personally dated by the patient and by the person who conducted the 
informed consent discussion.

10.8OBLIGATIONS OF INVESTIGATORS
The Principal  Investigator is responsible for the conduct of the clinical trial at the site 
in accordance with Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations and/or the Declaration 
of Helsinki. The PI is responsible for personally overseeing the treatment of all study 
patients. The PI must assure that all study site personnel, including sub-investigators 
and other study staff members, adhere to the study protocol and all FDA/GCP/NCI 
regulations and guidelines regarding clinical trials both during and after study 
completion.
The Principal  Investigator at each institution or site (local PI) will be responsible for 
assuring that all the required data will be collected, entered onto the appropriate 
eCRFs, and submitted within the study-specific timeframes. Periodically, monitoring 
visits may be conducted and the Principal Investigator will provide access to his/her 
original records to permit verification of proper entry of data. The study may also be 
subject to routine audits by the Audit Committee, as outlined in the DSMP.
10.9PREMATURE TERMINATION OF THE STUDY
The study  may be halted prematurely for any of the following reasons:
•If risk-benefit ratio becomes unacceptable owing to, for example:
oSafety findings from this study (e.g. SAEs)
oResults of any interim analysis
oResults of parallel clinical studies
oResults of parallel animal  studies (on e.g. toxicity, teratogenicity, 
carcinogenicity or reproduction toxicity).
•If the study conduct (e.g. recruitment rate; drop-out rate; data quality; protocol 
compliance) does not suggest a proper completion  of the trial within a reasonable 
time frame.
For any  of the above closures, the following applies:
•Closures should occur only after consultation between involved  parties  (including 
approval from the Data Monitoring Committee at Northwestern University).
•All affected institutions and their IRBs, competent authority (ies), study center, 
and the head of study center must  be informed as applicable according  to local 
law.

39 Version Date: April 3rd, 2019•In case of a partial study closure,  ongoing subjects, including those  in post study 
follow-up, must be taken care of in an ethical  manner.
10.10 PUBLICATION  POLICY
All potential publications  and/or data for potential publications (e.g. manuscripts, 
abstracts, posters, clinicaltrials.gov releases) must be approved in accordance with 
the policies and processes set forth in the Lurie Cancer Center DSMP. For trials that 
require high intensity monitoring, the assigned QAM will prepare a preliminary data 
summary (to be approved  by the DMC) no later than 3 months  after the study reaches 
its primary completion date (the date that the final subject is examined or receives an 
intervention for the purposes of final data collection for the primary endpoint). If the 
investigator’s wish to obtain DMC-approved data prior to this point (or prior to the 
point dictated by study design), the PI must send a written request for data to the 
QAM which includes justification. If the request is approved, data will be provided no 
later than 4 weeks after this request approval. The data will be presented to the DMC 
at their next available meeting, and a final, DMC-approved dataset will be released 
along with any DMC decisions regarding publication. The investigators are expected 
to use only DMC-approved data in future publications. The investigators should 
submit a copy of the manuscript to the biostatistician to confirm that the DMC- 
approved data are used appropriately. Once the biostatistician gives final approval, 
the manuscript may be submitted to Bayer Healthcare(funding  source).
Bayer recognizes  the right of the investigator to publish results upon completion of the 
study. However, the investigator must send a draft manuscript of the publication or 
abstract to Bayer at least 30 days in advance of submission in order to obtain 
approval prior to submission of the final version for publication or congress 
presentation. This will be reviewed promptly and approval will not be withheld 
unreasonably. In case of a difference of opinion between Bayer and the 
investigator(s), the contents of the publication will be discussed in order to find a 
solution which satisfies both parties. All relevant aspects regarding data reporting and 
publication will be part of the contract between Bayer and the investigator/institution. 
The Principal Investigator should also ensure that the information regarding the study 
be publicly available on the internet at www.clinicaltrials.gov .

Synopsis, 2.1  (Primary
Objective), 6.2  (Primary 
Endpoint Assessment),
9.1 (Primary  Outcome of 
Interest)Primary objective was  
progression-free 
survival (PFS).Changed primary 
objective
 to PFS at 4 
months.This was changed  at 
the recommendation of 
the company providing 
regorafenib (Bayer 
Healthcare). PFS at 4 
months is the only 
endpoint that the study 
is designed to assess 
with a pre-identified risk 
of error, which makes it 
the logical basis for
conclusion of  efficacy in 
this trial.

objectives.PFR has  been 
established as an 
endpoint for soft tissue 
sarcoma by the Soft 
Tissue and Bone 
Sarcoma Group of the 
European Organization 
for Research and 
Treatment of Cancer 
(EORTCSTBSG) to
account for  low PR 
rates in this disease. 
This was changed at

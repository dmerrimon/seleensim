Development Phase  2 
Purpose and R ationale  Presbyopia is an inevitable, age -related, gradual loss in the ability to focus at 
intermediate and near targets without spectacle or surgical correction due to a 
progressive loss of elasticity in the crystalline lens. The pharmacologic effects of 
clinical studies of BRIMOCHOL suggest the addition of an alpha -2 agonist  to a 
cholinergic agent, could have additive direct and indirect effects on both the iris constrictor and dilator muscles leading to robust and durable miosis and improvement in near visual acuity over monotherapy alone. Prior clinical studies and more recent nonclinical studies  conducted by Visus  demonstrate that the fixed -
dose combination of BRIMOCHOL and BRIMOCHOL  F both demonstrate a 
contribution of elements vs. the individual monotherapies formulated similarly not only on pupil size, but that iris/ciliary body carbachol  area under the curve ( AUC ) 
concentrations are ~ 50% higher with BRIMOCHOL  than carbachol alone. Ex  vivo 
studies in bovine ciliary muscle suggest alpha -2 receptors inhibit the contraction of 
cholinergically innervated ciliary muscle that does not occur when the ciliary 
muscle is at rest. Th ese findings support the rationale for combining an alpha -2 
agonist with a cholinergic agent to minimize the adverse events (AEs ) of 
browache /headache, myopic shift , and intraocular pressure ( IOP) changes 
associated with cholinergics alone, and indeed, clinical studies with BRIMOCHOL 
suggest this is the case. There are currently no Food and Drug Administration (FDA) -approved drug products to tr eat presbyopia.  
Study  Objectives  1. To compare the efficacy, pharmacodynamics  (PD) , safety, tolerability  and 
perception of treatment  of topically administered, BRIMOCHOL (carbachol 
2.75%/brimonidine tartrate 0.1%  fixed -dose combination with benzalkonium

2.1 Presbyopia  
Presbyopia is an inevitable, age- related, gradual loss in the ability to focus at intermediate and 
near targets without spectacle or surgical co rrection due to a progressive loss of elasticity in the 
crystalline lens. Symptoms of presbyopia include blurred vision, ocular discomfort/headache, 
fatigue/drowsiness from near work, increased working distance (arms too short), and need for brighter light for reading. In childhood, an amplitude of accommodation of 12 diopters (D) is typical  (Benzoni 2012).  Amplitude of accommodation declines linearly at a rate of about 0.3 D 
per year, falling below a threshold at which near vision is noticeably impaired by approximately 40-45 years of age. An estimated 1.27 billion people have presbyopia globally, and this number is projected to increase to 1.78 billion people by 2050 ( Frick 2015 ), including virtually all adults 
>50 years old .  
Therapeutic approaches to presbyopia cover a spectrum of nonsurgical to surgical techniques (Moarefi  2017). Non-invasive methods of correcting presbyopia (e.g., bifocal or multifocal 
progressive addition lenses) can be effective, but many patients are dissatisfied for cosmetic or other reasons and desire independence from spectacles. Various surgical techniques have been applied on the cornea, lens, or sclera ( Gil-Cazorla 2016). However, surgery is invasive and 
difficult to reverse in the event of complications or patient dissatisfaction. Moreover, surgical corrections usually require that patients choose for one eye to be corrected for distance and one for near, or monovision. Many patients do not like this outcome as this leaves them  without 
binocular vision or depth perception at distance and near  (Goertz 2014, McDonnell 2003). There 
are currently no Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drug products to treat presbyopia. 
2.2 Investigational Pr oducts  
Visus Therapeutics , Inc. (Visus) is developing BRIMOCHOL ( carbachol 2.75%/brimonidine 
tartrate 0.1% fixed -dose combination with BAK) and  BRIMOCHOL F ( carbachol 
2.75%/brimonidine tartrate 0.1% fixed-dose combination BAK- free) Topical O phthalmic 
Solutions as novel fixed-dose combination eye drops for improvement in near visual acuity in 
emmetropic phakic and pseudophakic presbyopia.  
The active pharmaceut ical ingredients carbachol and brimonidine tartrate are currently approved 
for topical ophthalmic use. Both carbachol  and brimonidine tartrate  have been used extensively 
in ophthalmic applications, and the approved products have been administered chronical ly at 
higher total daily doses than that in the se combination products.   
Five Investigator- initiated trials of a pharmacy -compounded formulation of BRIMOCHOL 
containing up to 3.0% carbachol and 0.2% brimonidine tartrate were conducted in presbyopic 
subjects;  the results of 4 of these studies were published (Abdelkader 2015, 2016, 2018, 2019). 
These studies evaluated pupillometry and near visual acuity: across a range of carbachol concentrations from 1.5% to 3.0%, the effects of BRIMOCHOL in older and younger presbyopes and in pseudophakes, the occurrence of tachyphylaxis over 3 months, and whether the fixed-dose

Visus Therapeutics, Inc.  Confidential  Page 20 of 98 combination demonstrated contribution of elements, i.e., that the combination is more effective 
to the individual monotherapies). These studies were not conducted by Visus. 
In brief, the studies concluded that there was a dose-response to carbachol concentration with the 
3% carbachol given the greatest peak and duration of effect on pupil size and near visual acuity (Abdelkader 2019). Commercially available carbachol and brimonidine tartrate was given 
concomitantly 5 minutes apart or as the fixed -dose BRIMOCHOL
 combination was more 
effective than carbachol and brimonidine tartrate given as monotherapy ( Abdelkader 2016 ), 
suggesting contribution of elements. No tachyphylaxis was noted over 3 months of daily dosing and clinical response was comparable in subjec ts older or younger than 50 years of age and in 
pseudophakes ( Abdelkader  2015). Additionally, there was no reports of headache in the largest 
of these studies in 57 patients ( Abdelkader  2019); suggesting the addition of brimonidine tartrate 
may have mitigated the incidence of headache, a common adverse event associated with the use of cholinergic agents alone. 
Please see the Investigator Brochure (IB) for additional information on the nonclinical and 
clinical support for BRIMOCHOL development. 
3 RATIONALE  FOR THE STUDY AND STUDY DESIGN  
3.1 Therapeutic Rationale for BRIMOCHOL  in Presbyopia  
In recent years, various miotics have been investigated alone or in combination with one or more 
other ag ents as treatments for presbyopia ( Benozzi 2012, Karanfil 2017, Renna 2017) . There are 
two currently marketed miotic agents in the U.S.: pilocarpine (ISOPTOCARPINE [ Prescribing 
Information ]) for the lowering of intraocular pressure ( IOP) and carbachol (MIO STAT® 0.01% 
[Prescribing Information]) for obtaining miosis during surgery. Carbachol was also marketed as 
ISTOPO® CARBACHOL for the lowering of IOP for more than 50 years but was withdrawn 
from the market for commercial and not safety reasons. Carbachol i s generally regarded as a 
stronger and longer- acting miotic than pilocarpine  (Gelatt 1984) though with less corneal 
permeability with a dosing frequency of up to 2 drops 3 times  daily  rather than up to 4 times 
daily  for pilocarpine. 
Both carbachol and pilocarpine are parasympathomimetic agents that induce miosis by promoting contraction of the iris sphincter muscle through activation of muscarinic receptors. However, both miotics also contract the ciliary muscle , thereby reducing IOP by putting traction 
on the scleral spur and trabecular meshwork, thereby increasing aqueous outflow ( Nardin  1966). 
It is also by this mechanism that miotics cause their main adverse events  (AEs) : 
browache/headache (a referred  pain from the ciliary muscle contraction/spasm) and a decrease in 
distance acuity by inducing a myopic shift ( Poinoosawmy 1976).  
Brimonidine tartrate is a selective alpha -2 adrenergic agonist that  works presynaptically in the 
management of elevated IOP to inhibit the release of norepinephrine ( Kato 2018) at the nerve 
terminals , thereby decreasing aqueous production, episcleral venous pressure and improving 
trabecular outflow. By inhibiting norepinephrine’s release, brimonidine tartrate’s main effect at the pupil is to inhibit contraction of the iris dilator muscle, which is classically stimulated as part

At the visits and times specified in the Schedule of Visits and Procedures (Section  1.2), venous 
blood samples of approximately 2.5 mL each will be collected and processed to plasma to 
determine the plasma concentrations of carbachol and brimonidine tartrate . Instructions for the 
collection and handling of blood samples will be provided in a Laboratory/PK Manual . The 
actual dat e and time (24-hour clock time) of each sampling will be recorded. 
Plasma samples will be analyzed by a laboratory approved by Visus . Concentrations of carb achol 
and brimonidine tartrate will be assayed using a validated method. 
10 SAFETY MONITORING AND R EPORTING 
10.1 Adverse E vents  
10.1.1 Definition and Reporting  
An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject or clinical investigational s ubject who has been administered a pharmaceutical product that does not 
necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment.  
AEs include: 
• Unfavorable changes in general condition 
• Subjective or objective signs/symptoms 
• Concomitant diseases or accidents 
• Clinically relevant adverse changes in laboratory parameters observed in a subject during 
a clinical study  
• Loss of ≥3 lines of distance or near visual acuity 
AEs comprise all disturbances of general health status, subjective and objective disease 
symptoms (including laboratory abnormalities), and accidents observed in the context of a 
clinical trial, irrespective of a possible causal relationship with the administration of the trial substance. Events occurring in the framework of a clinical trial during drug-free and post-treatment periods  are also to be designated as AEs . 
All AEs , whether volunteered, elicited, or noted on physical examination, will be recorded 
throughout the study (i.e., from Screening until EOS). 
Subjects will be queried for resolution of ongoing AEs  or until any unresolved AEs  are judged 
by the Investigator to have stabilized or if lost to follow-up. Resolution of all AEs  will be 
promptly documented by the site in the subject’s CRF. 
Any AE related to COVID-19 should be recorded as such.

Visus Therapeutics, Inc.  Confidential  Page 38 of 98 10.2 Serious Adverse Events  
10.2.1 Definitions  
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence at any dose that results in any of the following 
outcomes: 
• Death  
• A life -threatening event (i.e., puts the subject, in the view of the Principal Investigator 
(PI), at immediate risk of death)  
• Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization 
• A persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• A congenital anomaly/birth defect 
• Important medical event that may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the above outcomes 
An unexpected adverse drug event is any adverse drug event, the specificity or severity of which is not consistent with the current  IB. 
An AE is associated with the use of the drug if a reasonable possibility exists that the drug may have caused the event . 
10.2.2 Reporting 
SAEs that are unexpected and related to BRIMOCHOL are reportable to Regulatory Authorities. All SAEs , regardless of causality will be reported by the Investigator to the Medical Monitor 
through the 30-day period after the last dose of study treatment. Deaths and SAEs occurring after the 30-day safety follow-up period AND considered related to study treatment or study procedures must also be reported. 
Report all SAEs (initial and follow -up information) on an SAE form and send the form to the 
Sponsor or designee within 24 hours of the discovery of the event or information (see below). 
The Sponsor or designee  may request  follow-up and other additional information from the 
Investigator (e.g., hospital admission or discharge notes, laboratory results). SAEs will be followed up through completion or treatment termination.  
Report all deaths with the primary cause of death as the SAE term, as death is the outcome of the 
event, not the event itself. If an autopsy was performed, report the primary cause of death on the autopsy report as the SAE term. Forward autopsy and postmortem report(s) to the Sponsor or designee, as outlined above. 
If study treatment is discontinued, temporarily suspended, or the dose reduced because of an 
SAE, include this information in the SAE report. 

Protocol VT -001  
Visus Therapeutics, Inc.  
Version  9.0, 29 July 2021 
 
Visus Therapeutics, Inc.  Confidential  Page 39 of 98 Suspected unexpected serious a dverse reactions (SUSARs) are SAEs that qualify for mandatory 
expedited reporting to regulatory authorities where the SAE is suspected to be caused by the 
study treatment and is considered unexpected (i.e., not defined as expected in the current IB clinical study protocol, or approved labeling for marketed drugs). In this case, the Sponsor or designee will report to the relevant regulatory authorities and forward a formal notification describing the SUSAR to Investigators, according to regulatory requirements. Each Investigator must then notify his or her institutional review board ( IRB) of the SUSAR as required by local 
regulatory authorities and in accordance with IRB policy. 
10.2.3 Classification of Severity of Ad verse Event  
The severity of AEs will be categorized , as shown below.  
Categorization of Severity of Adverse Events   
Mild  The event is minor and does not cause significant discomfort to subject or change in 
activities of daily living (ADL); subject  is aware of symptoms, but symptoms are easily 
tolerated.  
Moderate The event is an inconvenience or concern to the subject and ca uses interference with ADL, 
but the subject  is able to continue with ADL.  
Severe The event significantly interferes with ADL and the subject is incapacitated and/or unable 
to continue with ADL.  
Potentially life- 
threatening  An event/reaction in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event/reaction; 
it does not refer to an event/reaction which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe.  
10.2.4 Relationship to Study Drug 
The Investigator will make a  determination of the relationship of the AE to the study drug using 
a 4-category system (not related, possible, probable, definite), as shown below. 
 
Categorization for Determining Relationship of AEs  to Study Treatment   
Not related  An AE that does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the drug 
and that can be reasonably explained by other factors, including underlying disease, 
complications, concomitant drugs, or concurrent treatment.  
Possible  An AE that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the administration of the drug (including the course after withdrawal of the drug) and that cannot be excluded as being possibly caused by the drug (e.g., existence of similar reports attributed to the drug and/or its analogues; reactions attributable to the pharmacological effect of the drug), although other 
factors such as underlying disease, complications, concomitant drugs, or concurrent treatment are presumable.  
Probable  An AE that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from  administration of the drug (including 
the course after withdrawal of the drug) and that can be excluded as being possibly caused by other factors, such as underlying disease, complications, concomitant drugs, or concurrent treatment.  
Definite  An AE that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the drug (including the course after withdrawal of the drug), follows a known or hypothesized cause -effect 
relationship, and (if appropriate) satisfies the following:

Visus Therapeutics, Inc.  Confidential  Page 40 of 98 • Positive results obtained i n drug sensitivity tests;  
• Toxic level of the drug present in blood or other body fluids.  
10.2.5 Ocular  Events  of Special Interest  
For this study medically important events comprise the following ocular  events, which are 
considered to be of special interest and by default are to be reported as SAEs:  
• Decrease in visual acuity of >15 ETDRS letters or > +0.3 LogMAR in uncorrected 
distance visual acuity at 24 hours  
• Moderate to severe intraocular inflammation (i.e., ≥2+ anterior chamber cell /flare)  
• Acute angle glaucoma or moderate to severe increase in IOP of >25mm Hg  
• Retinal tear or detachment  
10.3 Pregnancies  
Females of childbearing potential must have a negative urine pregnancy test at Visit 1 to participate. If a female has a positive urine pregnancy test during the study, the s ubject will be 
withdrawn from the study and the Investigator will notify IQVIA and/or the Sponsor within 24 hours of knowledge of the positive pregnancy test. 
The pregnancy will be followed to term and/or outcome, and this outcome must be reported to 
the Sponsor. A pregnancy is not regarded as an AE or SAE unless the birth results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or there is suspicion that the study treatment may have interfered with the effectiveness of a contraceptive medication or method.

All data collected during the study will be recorded in the subject’s eCRF. To maintain 
confidentiality, subjects will be identified only by Subject Number and initials.  
11.2 Site Monitoring  
The Sponsor or designee (e.g., Clinical Research Associate [ CRA ]) will be responsible for 
monitoring this clinical trial. The CRA will monitor  the study conduct, proper eCRF and source 
documentation completion and retention, and accurate study drug accountability. To this end, the CRA will visit the study site at suitable intervals and be in frequent contact through verbal and written communication. The Investigator will grant access to all documents (related to the study and subjects) at any time these are requested. In turn, the CRA will adhere to all requirements for subject confidentiality as outlined in the ICF. The Investigator and study st aff will be expected to 
cooperate with the CRA, to be available during a portion of the monitoring visit to answer questions, and to provide any missing information.

12 STATISTICAL METHODS AND D ATA ANALYSIS  
Data analysis will be performed according to the Sponsor’s or designee’s standard operating procedures (SOPs). A detailed s tatistical analysis plan (SAP) will be provided prior to database 
lock.  
The general analytical approach for all endpoints will be descriptive in nature. Unless otherwise 
stated , continuous variables will be summarized using the number of subjects, mean, standard 
deviation (SD), median, minimum, and maximum; and categorical variables will be summariz ed 
using the frequency count and the percentage of subjects in each category.  
All subject study data collected in the e CRFs  will be presented in data listings.  
12.1 Analysis S ets 
12.1.1 Safety Population 
All subjects who received any amount of study drug will be included in the Safety population. 
Subjects will be analyzed as treated.  
12.1.2 Modified Intent -to-Treat ( mITT) Population 
All subjects who receive at least 1 dose of study drug, have the primary efficacy assessments 
available at Baseline (pre -dose at Hour 0 on a dosing day) and at Hour 1 (on the same dosing 
day) for at least 1 dosing day will be included in the modified Intent- to-treat (mITT) Population. 
Subjects will be analyzed as treated.  
12.1.3 Per Protocol (PP) Population 
All mITT subjects who do not significantly violate the protocol. The PP population will be identified prior to locking the database. 
12.1.4 Pharma codynamic (P D) Population 
All subjects who received study drug and had at least one evaluable, post-dose PD  
(pupillometry) assessments without protocol deviations or events deemed to affect the PD.

Good Clinical Practice ( ICH GCP ) guidelines, principles enunciated in the Declaration of 
Helsinki, and all applicable FDA regulations . 
13.2 Responsibilities of the Investigator and IRB 
This protocol, the informed consent document, and all relevant supporting data must be 
submitted to the IRB for approval. IRB approval of the protocol, informed consent document, any advertisement used to recruit study subjects must be obtained before initiating the study. 
The PI is responsible for keeping the IRB advised of the progress of the study and of any 
changes made to the protocol as deemed appropriate, but in any case, at least once a year. The PI is also responsible for notifying the IRB of any reportable AEs  that occur during the study. 
13.3 Informed Consent Procedures  
At the first visit, prior to initiation of any study -related procedures, subjects must give their 
written consent to participate in the study after having been informed about the nature and 
purpose of the study, participation/termination conditions, and risks and benefits. The ICF must 
be signed and dated by the subject prior to study participation. A copy of the ICF must be 
provided to the subject. Signed consent forms must remain in the subject’s study file and be 
available for verification by the Sponsor or its representative at any time. 
Subjects included in the PK analyses will be required to sign a separate ICF. 13.4 Discontinuation of the Study  
The entire study may be discontinued at the discretion of the Sponsor as specified in 
Section  13.10.

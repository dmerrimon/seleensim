1. Study Objectives  
1. Primary objective  
1. Estimate change from baseline to six months in adherence superiority measure by MMAS -8 
in patients converted to a once -daily immunosuppressant regim en of Envarsus ®, 
everolimus, and prednisone versus patients convert ed to a twice -daily regimen of E nvarsus ® 
(once daily) , MMF  (twice daily) , and prednisone  (once daily) . 
2. Secondary objectives  
1. Estimate the composite of treatment failure rate, defined as acute allograft rejection with a 
Banff grade 1A or higher, graft loss, or death at six months  post -conversion, in patients 
converted to a once- daily immunosuppressant regimen of Envarsus ®, everolimus, and 
prednisone versus patients convert ed to a twice -daily regimen of E nvarsus ®, MMF, and 
prednisone.  
3. Outcomes 3.3.2 through 3.3.11 are considered exploratory  
1. Examine subject specific change of the Memphis Medication Side Effect Scale (Appendix 
B2, 12) at the time of the conversion versus six m onths post -conversion, compared 
between the two arms  (Appendix B2).  
2. Examine subject specific change in quality of life, using the SF -36 (Appendix  B3) at the 
time of conversion versus six months post -conversion, compared between the two 
arms.  
3. Measure and compare time -to-event analysis of secondary objective between the two 
arms  
1. Patient death (time to event analysis)  
2. Biopsy proven acute rejection (Banff 1a or higher, time to event analysis)  
3. Graft loss (time to event analysis)  
4. Examine the medication possession ratio (MPR)  of adjunctive immunosuppressants 
(Everolimus or mycophenolate) during follow up between the two arms  
1. Compare the prevalence of patients with MPR >80%  
5. Compare rates of adverse events and severe adverse events between the two arms  
6. Perform exploratory analysis of subclinical rejection and IF/TA in patients with one year 
protocol biopsies as compared to three month protocol biopsies between the two arms  
 
2. Background  
1. Rationale  
 
Non -adherence in renal transplant recipients has been widely reported, with conservative estimates 
reporting a prevalence between 20 and 67% (1,2). While it is difficult to determine the degree of nonadherence necessary to affect graft outcomes, there are several studies demonstrating the costs, with a graft loss rate 7 times greater than in adherent patients and an associated $15 -100 million annual 
costs.  Due to the complex causes of nonadherence, no singular approach is likely to be effective (3). 
However, one of the most commonly cited reasons for nonadherence by  patients is forgetfulness and 
disruptions in routine, with the evening dose of twice daily regimens the most likely to be affected (4).  
Tacrolimus LCP (Envarsus®) is a once -daily tacrolimus product that has demonstrated similar outcomes 
compared to twice -daily tacrolimus (tacrolimus IR) along with IL -2 receptor induction and 
mycophenolate mofetil adjunctive therapy with target concentrations of 4 -11 ng/mL (5).   In clinical trials 
that have studied the combination of tacrolimus and everolimus, such as the C RAD01AUS09 and ASSET 
studies, lower exposure to tacrolimus has demonstrated equivalent efficacy compared to standard 
Protocol Version 4.0  
11May2017  
exposure tacrolimus, with a lower incidence of adverse effects. In these two studies, tacrolimus 
exposure after 3 months (the time of conversion for our study) was 4 -6 ng/mL (US09) and 1.5- 3 ng/mL 
(ASSET), both of which show adequate efficacy and safety in regards to biopsy -proven acute rejection 
(BPAR) and adverse events (6,7). Additionally, the currently enrolling TRANSFORM study 
(CRAD001A2 433) utilizes a tacrolimus exposure of 2 -5 ng/mL from month 2 to month 24 post -
transplant.   Envarsus , while demonstrating a unique drug-delivery profile, still maintains an equivalent 
correlation between exposure (AUC) and C0 values to tacrolimus IR, validating a low -exposure goal for 
Envarsus in combination with everolimus (8 ). 
However, the combination of a once -daily product along with twice -daily products such as 
mycophenolate mofetil does not reduce the number of times per day immunosuppressive therapy  is 
necessary.  It has the potential, alternatively, to reduce adherence to the twice- daily product. 
Everolimus (Zortress®) is an mTOR inhibitor that has been studied and approved as an adjunctive 
immunosuppressant in kidney transplant recipients in a twic e-daily regimen (6).  However, due to the 
prolonged elimination half- life of everolimus (28±7 hours), a number of researchers have evaluated its 
ability to be used as a once -daily medication from a pharmacokinetic point of view. Kahan et al. 
demonstrated t hat, at steady state, the 24 -hour AUC, Cmin, and Cmax increased proportionately to the 
administered dose. In addition, the relationship between the Cmin and the AUC after once -daily 
administration was excellent; confirming the ability to use Cmin levels to  as an accurate predictor of 
drug exposure in once -daily everolimus regimens (9). Given this information, there have been 
subsequent clinical studies investigating a once -daily dosing interval with everolimus therapy. Carmellini 
et al. converted 12 patients to a once -daily regimen of everolimus and compared these patients to 12 
subjects who maintained a twice -daily dosing regimen. The investigators demonstrated that conversion 
to once -daily everolimus in kidney transplant recipients did not significantly change their Cmin 
concentration. Further, there were no adverse events or acute rejection episodes 6 months after the 
conversion (12 ). In a larger study, Favi et al. compared 40 kidney transplant recipients randomized to 
once -daily everolimus with a target c oncentration of 2 -6 ng/mL or twice -daily everolimus with a target 
concentration of 3 -12 ng/mL. The investigators demonstrated equivalent renal function and acute 
rejection rates between the two groups, while the once-daily everolimus regimen demonstrated 
significantly improved cholesterol indices ( 13,14).  In combination with tacrolimus -based regimens, it 
has also demonstrated excellent efficacy in preventing acute rejection, with significantly reduced tacrolimus exposure (goal trough concentrations:   Ever olimus 3 -8 ng/mL)  (6,7) . 
With the availability of well -studied once -daily formulations of tacrolimus, the ability to achieve a true 
once -daily immunosuppressant regimen along with Everolimus and steroids may finally be achievable 
and have the potential to optimize immunosuppression safety and efficacy in kidney transplantation.

3. In multiple chronic conditions it has been shown that once -daily 
regimens or dose reduction frequency through the selection of once -
daily medications has improved adherence.  Meta -analysis of 
medication adherence studie s demonstrated that dose taking 
compliance decreases as medication regimens increase from QD, 
measured by MEMS (DOI: 10.1097/CRD.0b013e3180cabbe7).  
 
3. Study design  
1. Single -center, open -label, randomized comparative pilot trial.  
2.  There will be 20 subjects in each arm, with a total study size of 40 subjects.  
2. Allocation: Four random permuted -blocks of ten with equal arm allocation ratio will be used. 
Since no other stratification criteria are considered, larger block sizes will be appropriate. In 
each block, ten random numbers will be generated using SAS 9.4 with a range from zero to 
ninety nine. Even numbers will be assigned the intervention arm and odd numbers will be 
assigned the standard of care with resulting 1:1 allocation.  
3. Intervention Model: Parallel assignment  
4. Masking: This will be an open- label study as masking is not feasible given we are comparing 
twice -a-day to once -a-day regimen and its effect on adherence.  
5. Selection and enrollment of subjects  
1. Inclusion criteria  
1. Male or female adult (≥18 years old) with a history of solitary kidney 
transplant within 3 months (±2 months) of transplant.  
2. Patients must be capable of understanding the purposes and risks of 
the study and have the ability to give written informed consent and 
be willing to participate and comply with the study.  
3. Women of childbearing potential and sexually active males must be willing to use contraception, as indicated in Section 6 of the 
protocol .  Subjects who are not of reproductive potential  (status 
post bi lateral tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy, hysterectomy, 
or vasectomy ), not sexually active, whose current partner(s) is not 
of reproductive potential, or whose sexual activity is exclusively homosexual are eligible without requiring the use of contraception.  
2. Exclusion criteria  
1. Patients will be excluded if they are pregnant or nursing females or males with a pregnant female partner  
2. Recipient of multiple organ transplant

13. A condition or disorder that, in the opinion of the investigator, may adversely affect the outcome of the study or the safety of the subject  
2. Study enrollment procedures  
1. Subject Identification/Recruitm ent: Members of the research team will identify potentially 
eligible patients who have undergone solitary kidney transplantation in the past three 
months ( ±2 months ). An initial evaluation of existing patient information may be performed 
to determine potential eligibility. This initial review may be performed prior to consent; 
however no protocol driven tests or procedures may be performed until signed informed 
consent has been obtained.  
2. Informed Consent: A qualified member of the research team, Human Subjects Protection 
Trained, will approach and explain the study and offer participation.  The study will be 
explained in a manner consistent with the level of education pertaining to the 
patient.  Enrollment procedure will involve face -to-face meetings of  the patients to inform 
and review informed consent documentation.  The participant will sign the consent form 
prior to evaluation of adherence measures.  Copies of the informed consent will be 
appropriately placed in the corresponding chart and the patien t will be provided with a copy 
of the signed consent form.  Non -consenting individuals will also be ensured that no penalty 
will arise due to denying participation.  Those who choose to participate in the trial will be 
informed that at any point they reserve the right to leave the study.   
3. Enrollment: Patients who give informed consent to study participation will go on to 
complete baseline procedures necessary to determine eligibility for randomization. Once 
deemed eligible for the study according to the in clusion/exclusion criteria, the patient will 
be enrolled as study participant.  Information to be entered upon enrollment includes 
demographic information and date of transplant surgery. Enrolled subjects will be 
randomized to one of the treatment arms in the applicable cohort.  
4. Study interventions  
1. Interventions, administration, and duration  
1. For the first three months (±2 months) post- transplant, the pool of patients from which 
subject of this study will be recruited will receive the current standard of car e.  Standard of 
care is described as a regimen of tacrolimus IR BID (5 -12ng/mL) + MMF 1g BID + prednisone 
QD Three months (±2 months) post -transplant and at the time of recruitment, they are 
randomized to one of the two arms to either receive a complete once -a-day regimen or to 
receive twice- daily regimen. 
2. Post -randomization, subjects will be  converted to one of the two arms, as shown below, and 
followed for a total period of six months (primary endpoint), or until a terminal end point is reached.  
1. Arm 1: Control -- twice -daily regimen of En varsus QD (5 - 12ng/mL) + MMF (goal dose 1g  
BID) + prednisone QD for 6 months  
Protocol Version 4.0  
11May2017  
2. Arm  2: Intervention -- once -a-day regimen of Envarsus QD (2 - 5ng/mL) + everolimus QD 
(3-8ng/mL) + prednisone QD for 6 months  
1. Envarsus  will be supplied for both Arms from Veloxis 
Pharmaceuticals  
2. Adherence assessment  
1. Adherence to the study intervention will be assessed at all study visits noted on the 
Schedule of Ev aluations (Section 5.1), using the eight point Morisky Medication Adherenc e 
Scale (MMAS- 8) (17).

2. Timing of evaluation  
1. Pre-Randomization Evaluations  
Baseline  
Protocol Version 4.0  
11May2017  
Evaluations listed under the baseline visit may be performed up to 14 days prior 
to randomization. Once the subject has been successfully screened and 
accepted for randomization, randomization must be completed within 48 hours.    
2. Intervention and Evaluations  
 
Once the subject has been successfully randomized, the patients will be directe d 
to the hospital pharmacy to pick up study medications.  Study evaluations must 
take place within the time window indicated on the Schedule of Evaluations (Section 5 .1)
 
3. Clinical and Laboratory Assessments:  
1. Laboratory evaluations will be performed at certified laboratories according to the study schedule. Required tests are specified in the Schedule of Evaluations (Section 5.1)  
2. All subjects will undergo clinical assessment by the investigator or the investigator’s designee in the manner and at the time s specified in the 
Schedule of Evaluations (Section 5.1)  
1. Adverse events will be determined and defined according to Section 8 of the protocol  
2. Doses will be recorded of all immunosuppressants. The adjuvant immunosuppressant (mycophenolate or everolimus) will be counted and compared to the amount expected to be remaining based on the prescribed amount. An MPR will be calculated as follows: (Total Days’ Supply in Period/(Last Fill 
Date - First Fill Date + Last Fill Days’ Supply))  
3. Rejection and infection events  will be recorded, as defined in 
Section 5.4)  
4. Hospitalization events will be determined by questioning the 
subject and review of hospital admissions in the EHR.  
3. Graft function assessment will be monitored at regular intervals using the 4 -variable  abbreviated MDRD equation. It will be monitored at 
baseline and the end of the study for study outcomes and any time points dictated by standard of care follow -up in between those time 
points.  
4. Definitions  
1. Acute rejection is  defined as a  renal allograft biopsy showing grade 1A 
or greater, by the 1997 Banff Criteria and all updates since then. Biopsies will be performed when clinically warranted, based on changes in allograft function.  
2. Rejection reversal is defined as return of serum creat inine to within 10% 
of baseline and/or histologic clearance by Banff Criteria 
3. Resistant acute rejection is defined as no clinical or histologic improvement by renal biopsy within 7 -10 days of initiation of 
treatment.  
4. Recurrent acute rejection is defined as rejection recurring more than 
two weeks after documented rejection reversal.  
5. Opportunistic Infections will be defined according the American Society 
of Transplant Recommendations for Screening, Monitoring, and

return to standard of care medications and request to continue with final assessment using MMAS -8, 
MMSE Scale and SF-36  will be discussed with a qualified team member.     
8. Adverse Events  
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence (i.e., any unfavorable and 
unintended sign [including abnormal laboratory findings], symptom or disease) in a subject or 
clinical investigation subject after providing written informed consent for participation in the 
study. Therefore, an AE may or may not be temporally or causally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product. The occurrence of adverse events should be sought by non -
directive questioning of the subject at each visit during the study. Adverse events also may be 
detected when they are volunteered by the subject during or between visits or through physical 
examination, laboratory test, or other assessments. Abnormal laboratory values or test results constitute adverse events only if they fulfill at least one of the following criteria:  
Protocol Version 4.0  
11May2017  
1. they induce clinical signs or symptoms,  
2. they are considered clinically significant,  
3. they require therapy.  
 
Clinically significant abnormal laboratory values or test results should be identified through a 
review of values outside of normal ranges/clinically notable ranges, significant changes from 
baseline or the previous visit, or values which are considered to be non -typical in subject with 
underlying disease. Investigators have the responsibility for managing the safety of individual 
subject and identifying adverse events. Adverse events should be recorded in the Adverse 
Events CRF with them accompanied by the following information:  
1. severity of adverse events will be determined using the grading system outlined in the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 4.03 (CTCAE), as it best 
fits the diagnostic terminology used in naming the event at the site clinical level.  
2. possibility of relationship to the study treatment (no/yes)  
3. its duration (start and end dates) or if the event is ongo ing an outcome of not recovered 
or not resolved should be reported.  
4. whether it constitutes a serious adverse event (SAE), if so report date should be provided  
5. action taken regarding study treatment  
6. whether other medication or therapies have been taken (con comitant medication/non -
drug therapy)  
7. its outcome (not recovered/not resolved; recovered/resolved; recovering/resolving, 
recovered/resolved with sequelae; fatal; or unknown)  
An SAE is any adverse event which meets any one of the following criteria:  
• An SAE is any adverse event that is life -threatening or that results in any of the following 
outcomes: death; in -patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; 
persistent or significant disability or incapacity; or a congenital anomaly or birth defect. 
Any other medical event that, in the medical judgment of the Principal Investigator, may jeopardize the subject or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above is also considered an SAE.  A planned medical or surgical 
procedure is not, in itself, an SAE.  Also specifically excluded from this definition of SAE 
is any event judged by the Principal Investigator to represent progression of the malignancy under study, unless it results in death within the S AE Reporting Period.  
• Reporting of Serious Adverse Events .  Within 24 hours of first awareness of the event 
(immediately if the event is fatal or life -threatening), certain SAEs  will be report ed to 
Veloxis by ("SAEs," as defined below) that occur during the SAE reporting period (as 
defined below) in a Study subject assigned to receive the Veloxis Product.  The subset of 
SAEs to be reported for this Study are those that fit into either of the following categories: (1) a death, regardless of whether it is considered related to treatment with 
the Veloxis Product, or (2) an SAE that is assessed by the Principal Investigator as both 
Protocol Version 4.0  
11May2017  
related to treatment with the Veloxis Product and unexpected for that Product.  An 
event should be considered "related" to the Veloxis Product if a relationship is at least a 
reasonable possibility, and "unexpectedness" should be based upon current Product 
labeling.  Principal Investigator will report such SAEs using either Institution's Internal Adverse Event Report form or an FDA MEDWATCH form together with the Reportable 
Adverse Event Fax Cover Sheet provided by Veloxis. SAEs should be reported as soon as 
they are determined to meet the definition, even if complete information is not yet available.  
• SAE Reporting Period.  The SAEs that are subject to this reporting provision are those 
that occur from after the first dose of the Veloxis Product through 72 hours after discontinuation of the Veloxis Product.  In addition, any a nd all related SAEs that occur 
after the reporting period of which the Principal Investigator becomes aware should also be reported.  
•  
 
AEs and SAEs will be reported in accordance with the FDA Guidelines for Post -Marketing 
Reporting of Adverse Events 21 CRF 314.80 and 21 CRF 600.80 
http://www.fda.gov/medwatch/report/regs.htm .  Any  serious adverse event or a non- serious 
adverse event that is related to the study and unexpected will be reported to the FDA, per reporting guidelines, as soon as possible, but no later than 15 working days.. Further, all serious adverse events that are related to the study and are unexpected must be reported to The 
Medical University of South Carolina IRB within 10 days per The Medical University of South 
Carolina IRB Unanticipated Problems and Adverse Events Policy and Procedures  reporting 
guidelines.    
 
9. Criteria for intervention discontinuation 
1. The intervention will be withheld/discontinued for AE  of grade 3 or higher or if requested by the 
study participant.  
2. Additionally, the intervention will be discontinued if the subject meets criteria for the following reasons:  
1. Pregnancy:  If a woman becomes pregnant or a male’s female partner becomes pregnant 
while on -study, the subject will be required to instruct investigators immediately.  
2. Loss of graft:  Defined as death or need for retransplant. Patients will be deemed a 
treatment failure and the intervention will be discontinued. \ 
10. Statistical considerations  
1. Outcomes  
1. Primary outcome - Treatment efficacy, defined difference in change from baseline to six 
month measure by MMAS -8 in both arms.  
2. Secondary objectives  
1. Secondary outcome - Safety outcomes of treatment failure rate, defined as acute 
allograft rejection with a Banff grade 1A or higher, graft loss, or death at one year post -
conversion in both arms.  
Protocol Version 4.0  
11May2017  
2. Sample size estimation for the primary outcome  
1. No formal power analysis conducted since this is a pilot study. However, the sample size 
proposed (n=40) would be able to observe a mean difference between groups in the change 
of MMAS -8 scores of 2 ± 2 points (95% CI 0.73,3.27) with 87% power. Additionally, a mean 
difference between groups in the change in the Memphis Side Effect Scale (MSES) of 5 ± 5 
points (95% CI 1.83,8.17) would have 87% power in the current sample size. Given the average MSES score of 25 points in kidney transplant patients within 2 years of transplant, this appears to be a feasible outcome (11). In order to demonstrate noninferiority in treatment failure, it would require 400 subjects (200 in each group) to have 80% power, estimating a treatment failure rate of 20% and an acceptable difference of 10%. We expect that 70% of those approached meeting study inclusion/exclusion criteria will agree to participate and that 85% of those that consent and are enrolled in the study will complete all visits. If the 95% CIs for the actual enrollment and completion proportions are outside of these thresholds, then feasibility will not be met. If the 95% CIs encompass these expected 
values, then feasibility will be met.  
3. Missing data and imputation methods  
1. Under the intention -to-treat  principle, all subje cts are included in the analysis. Extensive 
efforts will be made to keep all missing data to a minimum and minimize loss to follow -up 
(LTFU).  However, it is likely that some missing data may occur.  
 
11. Human subjects  
1. Institutional review board (IRB) review and informed consent  
1. This protocol, the ICF, and any subsequent modifications must be reviewed and 
approved by the IRB . A signed and dated ICF must be obtained from the subject as 
defined in 21CFR50.3.  The ICF must also be signed and dated by a member of the study 
staff qualified to be delegated the authority to obtain informed consent.  A copy of the 
ICF must be given to the subject and the consent process must be documented in the subject’s medical record.  The PI or delegated sub -Investigator is responsible for 
ensuring that informed consent is obtained from each patient prior to conducting any study -related activities.  
2. No deviations from or changes to the study protocol should be initiated except when necessary to eliminate immediate hazard to the subject.  However, the IRB and Study Sponsor must be informed of this 
as soon as possible thereafter.  It is the PI’s responsibility to report SAEs 
occurring during the study to the IRB, as required and as soon as 
possible.   
2. Study modification/discontinua tion 
1. The study may be modified or discontinued at any time by the IRB, the 
sponsor, the OHRP, the FDA, or other government agencies as part of their duties to ensure that research subjects are protected.  
2. After 20 subjects have been randomized and completed  follow -up, 
efficacy and safety endpoints will be reviewed by a blinded Safety Monitor to identify if the risk profile is as expected. If significantly increased risk is identified in either or both arms of the study, sufficient 
to increase the risk over the potential benefit of the study, the study will 
be discontinued. Examples are included below:  
Protocol Version 4.0  
11May2017  
1. A 6-month rejection rate difference between arms > 20%, or if > 
40% in either arm  
2.  A difference in grade 3 or higher infections (based on CTCAE) 
between arms of  > 20% 
3. A graft loss difference between arms > 20%  
12. Publication of research findings  
1. Publication of the results of this trial will be reviewed and approved by all 
coinvestigators.  Final results will be submitted to ClinicalTrials.gov.  Any presentation, 
abstract, or manuscript will be made available for review by the sponsor prior to 
submission.

cells/tubular cross -section or group of 10 tubular cells)  
IIA: Cases with mild to moderate intimal arteritis (v1)  
IIB: Cases with severe intimal arteritis comprising >25% of the luminal area (v2)  
III:  Cases with ‘transmural’ arteritis and/or arterial fibrinoid change and necrosis of medial smooth muscle cells with accompanying 
lymphocytic inflammation (v3)  
 
Biopsy Results*  Treatment  Other Requirements  Follow -Up 
    
Borderline rejection  Methylprednisolone 250 mg 
every 24 hours  
for 3 doses   Increase level of maintenance 
immunosuppression (maximize 
MMF dosing, increase tacrolimus 
levels to upper limit of target range.  
 Assess for non- adherence.  
 If diabetic, ensure patient is 
monitoring blood sugars frequently.   Consider re -biopsy in 7 
days if inadequate response to therapy  
 Patient should have labs 
weekly  
 Patient should be seen in 
clinic  with labs one week 
after completing treatment  
    
Banff ’97 1A 
cellular rejection  Methylprednisol one 500 mg

Banff ’97 1B or 
greater rejection  
 
(with viable tissue 
and ability to obtain 
maintenance 
immunosuppressants 
in order to be 
adherent going 
forward)  Thymoglobulin® 1.5 
mg/kg/day for 7 doses  
(10 mg/kg) or 7 days of total 
suppression  
Pre-medicate patient with 
methylprednisolone 500 mg 
IV x 1 prior to first dose of 
Thymoglobulin® in addition to 
acetaminophen and 
diphenhydramine.  
May consider giving 
additional doses of 
methylprednisolone 250 mg 
IV prior to subsequent doses.  
 
*Always consider patient’s 
prior Thymoglobulin 
exposure when determining 
treatment  Must have daily CBCs for 
Thymoglobulin® dosing.  If WBC 
2,000- 3,000 or PLT 50,000- 75,000, 
give half dose.  If WBC <2,000 or 
PLT <50,000, hold dose .   
 Increase level of maintenance 
immunosuppression (maximize 
MMF dosing, increase tacrolimus levels to upper limit of target range 
(tacrolimus levels must be > 8 
ng/mL at the time of last 
Thymoglobulin® dose ). 
 Assess for non- adherence.  
 Patient must be restarted on anti -
microbial prophylaxis including 
CMV prophylaxis, PCP 
prophylaxis, and fungal prophylaxis (follow initial protocols 
with regards to dosing and 
duration ).  Consider re- biopsy in 7 
days if inadequate response to therapy  
 Patient should have labs weekly  
 Patient should be seen in 
clinic  with labs one week 
after completing treatment  
    
Features of AMR 
and cellular 
rejection  Please refer to AMR protocol for details.  
    
Calcineurin 
inhibitor toxicity 
with no evidence of 
rejection  
(vacuolization of 
tubules, arteriolar 
hyalinosis)  Consider patient’s candidacy for mTOR conversion.   
Refer to mTOR conversion /CNI minimization protocol for details.  
 
* Note:  Biopsy should be performed within 48 hours of suspicion for acute rejection

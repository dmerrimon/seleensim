TITLE
A Phase 1b/2 Study of MEDI4736 in Combination with Tremelimumab, MEDI4736 Monotherapy, and 
Tremelimumab Monotherapy in Subjects with Metastatic or Recurrent Gastric or Gastroesophageal Junction Adenocarcinoma
HYPOTHESIS
MEDI4736 in combination with tremelimumab, MEDI4736 monotherapy, and tremelimumab monotherapy 
will be safe and demonstrate clinical activity in subjects with metastatic or recurrent gastric or 
gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma.
OBJECTIVES
Primary Objectives
1. For Phase 1b: To assess the safety and tolerability, describe any dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), and 
determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or the highest protocol-defined doses (in the absence of 
exceeding the MTD) for MEDI4736 in combination with tremelimumab in subjects with metastatic or recurrent gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma.
2. For Phase 2: To determine objective response rate (ORR) and progression-free survival (PFS) at 6 months 
(PFS-6) based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1 as primary measures of 
clinical activity of MEDI4736 in combination with tremelimumab in second- and third-line subjects whose tumors have a positive interferon-gamma (IFN- γ) gene expression signature and in unselected second- and 
third-line subjects, MEDI4736 monotherapy, and tremelimumab monotherapy in subjects with metastatic or recurrent gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma.
Secondary Objectives
1. For Phase 1b: To assess disease control rate (DCR; defined as complete response [CR], partial response 
[PR], or stable disease [SD]), ORR, and PFS-6 based on RECIST v1.1 as measures of clinical activity of 
MEDI4736 in combination with tremelimumab in subjects with metastatic or recurrent gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma.
2. For Phase 2: To further describe the safety and tolerability of MEDI4736 in combination with 
tremelimumab, MEDI4736 monotherapy, and tremelimumab monotherapy in subjects with metastatic or 
recurrent gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma.
3. For Phase 2: To assess DCR and duration of response (DoR) based on RECIST v1.1 and overall survival 
(OS) as additional measures of clinical activity of MEDI4736 in combination with tremelimumab in 
second- and third-line subjects whose tumors have a positive IFN- γ gene expression signature and in 
unselected second- and third-line subjects, MEDI4736 monotherapy, and tremelimumab monotherapy in 
subjects with metastatic or recurrent gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma.
4. For Phase 2: To define the components of programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression (ie, tumoral 
vs stromal) that correlate with clinical activity of MEDI4736 in combination with tremelimumab, 
MEDI4736 monotherapy, and tremelimumab monotherapy in subjects with metastatic or recurrent gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma.

STUDY DESIGN
This is a randomized, multicenter, open-label, Phase 1b/2 study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and clinical 
activity of MEDI4736 in combination with tremelimumab, MEDI4736 monotherapy, and tremelimumab monotherapy in subjects with metastatic or recurrent gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma who meet the followingcriteria:  
Second-line (Phase 1b):
• Must have received and have progressed, or are refractory to one systemic platinum- or fluoropyrimidine-
based chemotherapy regimen for metastatic or recurrent disease, or
Second-line (Phase 2 Arms A, B, and C):
• Must have received and have progressed, or are refractory to one systemic platinum- or fluoropyrimidine-
based chemotherapy regimen for metastatic or recurrent disease, or
• Must have received and have progressed, or are refractory to one systemic platinum- or fluoropyrimidine-
based therapy as part of neoadjuvant or adjuvant regimen with relapse within 6 months of therapy, or
Third-line (Phase 2 Arm D):
• Must have received and have progressed, or are refractory to two systemic regimens (one standard 
platinum- or fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy regimen and one approved regimen for metastatic or 
recurrent disease)
• Subjects who have received and have progressed, or are refractory to one systemic platinum or 
fluoropyrimidine-based therapy as part of neoadjuvant or adjuvant regimen with relapse within 6 months will count as a line of therapy in the metastatic/recurrent setting. 
Second- and Third-line (Phase 2 Arm E; as of Amendment 6):
•  
• Must have received and have progressed, or are refractory to one systemic platinum- or fluoropyrimidine-
based chemotherapy regimen for metastatic or recurrent disease, or
• Must have received and have progressed, or are refractory to one systemic platinum- or fluoropyrimidine-
based therapy as part of neoadjuvant or adjuvant regimen with relapse within 6 months of therapy, or
• Must have received and have progressed, or are refractory to two systemic regimens (one standard 
platinum- or fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy regimen and one approved regimen for metastatic or recurrent disease), and
• Third-line subjects who have received and have progressed, or are refractory to one systemic platinum- or 
fluoropyrimidine-based therapy as part of neoadjuvant or adjuvant regimen with relapse within 6 months 
will count as a line of therapy in the metastatic/recurrent setting.
Up to approximately 135 subjects for Phase 1b/2 will be enrolled at approximately 40 study centers globally.
Phase 1b
The dose and schedule of MEDI4736 in combination with tremelimumab for Phase 1b of the current study is
based on emerging safety, clinical, and PK/pharmacodynamic data from the ongoing Study D4190C00006, which is evaluating the combination of MEDI4736 and tremelimumab in subjects with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). It is anticipated that a dose determined as safe in NSCLC will also be safe in subjects with metastatic or recurrent gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma.

. Subjects will be monitored for 
DLT prior to initiation of enrollment in Phase 2. If unacceptable toxicity is encountered or ≥3 out of 9 of 
subjects experience a DLT during this safety run-in, a lower dose level may be evaluated prior to initiation of Phase 2. 
A total of 6 subjects were enrolled in Phase 1b and treated with the dose and schedule described above; there 
were no DLTs in these 6 subjects. The Phase 1b portion of the study is now complete.
Phase 2
Once the MTD or highest protocol-defined dose (in the absence of exceeding the MTD) has been defined in 
Phase 1b, enrollment in Phase 2 will begin. In Phase 2, subjects will be enrolled in 1 of 5 treatment arms, as listed below. Second-line subjects with metastatic or recurrent gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma will be 
randomized in a 2:2:1 ratio to Arms A, B, or C. In parallel, third-line subjects with metastatic or recurrent 
gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma will be enrolled in Arm D. Upon closure of Arms A, B, and C and completion of Arm D, second- and third-line subjects with metastatic or recurrent gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma and a positive IFN- γ gene expression signature will be enrolled in Arm E.
• Arm A: MEDI4736 in combination with tremelimumab in second-line subjects with metastatic or 
recurrent gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma 
• Arm B: MEDI4736 monotherapy in second-line subjects with metastatic or recurrent gastric or GEJ 
adenocarcinoma 
• Arm C: Tremelimumab monotherapy in second-line subjects with metastatic or recurrent gastric or GEJ 
adenocarcinoma
• Arm D: MEDI4736 in combination with tremelimumab in third-line subjects with metastatic or recurrent 
gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma 
• Arm E (as of Amendment 6): MEDI4736 in combination with tremelimumab in second- and third-line 
subjects with metastatic or recurrent gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma and a positive IFN- γ gene expression 
signature 
During Phase 2, subjects will be monitored continuously for safety according to the same criteria employed 
during Phase 1b. If during the treatment period, ≥33% of subjects experience safety events meeting DLT 
criteria, even if outside of the DLT evaluation period, enrollment may be paused and study data will be 
reviewed to determine whether additional monitoring or alternate dose levels or treatment schedules should be 
evaluated prior to further enrollment. In addition, after the first 20 subjects have been dosed with MEDI4736 in combination with tremelimumab for a minimum of 6 weeks (in both second- and third-line settings), safety data will be reviewed by the sponsor.
All subjects will be evaluated for clinical activity, on a regular basis as specified in the protocol, and their 
disease status primarily analyzed according to RECIST v1.1. Clinical decision making in subjects undergoing 
treatment will be based on RECIST v1.1 with modifications. Enrollment into any arm in Phase 2 may be discontinued at the discretion of the sponsor should emerging clinical or nonclinical data suggest that continued treatment may not be beneficial to a given arm.
 
Pre-specified interim analyses performed on Arms A and B showed that the 
criteria for expansion were met; however, enrollment into Arms A, B, and C was stopped at the sponsor’s 
discretion. Based on evolving science suggesting that the IFN- γ gene expression signature will better predict
responders of immunotherapy (Ulloa-Montoya et al, 2013; Peng et al, 2015) as well as data from the initial portion of the study, it was decided to proceed with MEDI4736 in combination with tremelimumab in bothsecond- and third-line subjects with metastatic or recurrent gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma who had a positive IFN-γ gene expression signature. The discontinuation of Arms A, B, and C was not due to safety concerns.
Arm D has completed.
Dose-Expansion in a Biomarker Selected Population
As of Amendment 6, a new arm (Arm E) of MEDI4736 in combination with tremelimumab has been added to 
evaluate efficacy and safety in subjects with second- and third-line gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma with a positive tumor IFN- γ gene expression signature. Numerous clinical trials have demonstrated the predictive 
nature of a Type 1 helper T-cell (Th1) gene signature and the subsequent response to immunotherapy for solid

All 
subjects will be followed for survival until the end of study (5 years after the last subject is enrolled or the date the study is closed by the sponsor, whichever occurs first). Evaluation of a possible correlation between 
clinical activity of MEDI4736 and tremelimumab in combination and IFN- γ gene expression as well as other 
potential biomarkers (eg, tumoral and stromal PD-L1 expression) will be ongoing throughout the study.

7 of 180 Template 16.2TREATMENT AND REGIMENS
Subjects will be treated in either Phase 1b or Phase 2 of the study.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Subjects who are treated with MEDI4736 monotherapy (Arm B) or tremelimumab monotherapy (Arm C) may 
crossover to be treated with MEDI4736 in combination with tremelimumab upon  confirmed progressive disease (PD) under restricted circumstances (as outlined in the protocol). Subjects who are treated with the combination of MEDI4736 and tremelimumab may continue their study treatment or have reinduction of the study treatment upon a confirmed PD under restricted circumstances (as outlined in the protocol). Subjects in 
both Phase 1b and Phase 2 who derived clinical benefit from study treatment during the initial 12-month 
treatment period and who subsequently developed PD during the 12-month follow-up period, will be treated for up to 12 months with the same regimen that the subject was given upon initial study entry. Dose delays and discontinuations to manage clinically significant treatment-related toxicity will be allowed.
STATISTICAL METHODS
Sample Size and Power Calculations
Up to approximately 135 subjects for Phase 1b/2 will be enrolled in this study.
Phase 1b
The sample size for Phase 1b is not based on formal statistical power considerations. The number of subjects 
in this phase of the study is based on a safety run-in schema investigating the safety and tolerability of a dose and schedule selected for dose expansion in Study D4190C00006.

Efficacy
Efficacy analysis will be based on the As-treated Population, which includes all subjects who receive any 
investigational product. Response-related endpoints and corresponding time-to-event endpoints for primary 
and secondary efficacy endpoints programmatically-derived from the investigator’s assessments or BICR, as 
well as OS will be analyzed. More details will be provided in the statistical analysis plan.
OR is defined as best overall response of confirmed CR or confirmed PR according to RECIST v1.1. DoR is defined as the duration from the first documentation of OR to the first documented disease progression 
according to RECIST v1.1 or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. 
DC is defined as confirmed CR, confirmed PR, or SD based on RECIST v1.1. DC at 16 and 24 weeks is 
defined as a best overall response of confirmed CR, confirmed PR or having SD with duration of SD lasting 
16 and 24 weeks, respectively.
PFS will be measured from the date of randomization or start of treatment until the documentation of disease 
progression according to RECIST v1.1 or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. For subjects who are alive and progression-free at the time of data cut-off (DCO) for analysis, PFS will be censored at the last 
tumor assessment date. The PFS-6  are the proportion of subjects with PFS at 6 months  
OS will be measured as the time from date of randomization or the start of treatment until death due to any 
cause. For subjects who are alive at the time of DCO, OS will be censored on the last date when subjects are known to be alive.
The 2 co-primary efficacy endpoints for Phase 2 are OR and PFS-6 using RECIST v1.1. The ORR is defined 
as the proportion of subjects with OR. The 2-sided 90% and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for ORR will be 
estimated using the exact binomial distribution. Kaplan-Meier curves will be generated for PFS and used to 
MedImmune Protocol D4190C00021
MEDI4736 24Jan2017; Amendment 6 Final
9 of 180 Template 16.2estimate the PFS-6 along with its 2-sided 90% and 95% CIs. 
Secondary efficacy endpoints include DC, DoR, PFS, , OS, and 1-year survival for Phase 2, and OR, DC
and PFS-6 for Phase 1b. The DCR is defined as the proportion of subjects with DC. The 2-sided 90% and 95% CIs of DCR will be provided using an exact probability method. DCR at 16 and at 24 weeks will be estimated along with their 2-sided 90% and 95% CIs. Kaplan-Meier method will be used to estimate the median 
DoR/PFS/OS and landmark PFS/OS rate along with their CIs.
Only subjects whose archival tumor tissue sample showed a positive IFN- γ gene expression signature will be 
eligible for enrollment to Arm E. This will allow identification of a unique population of gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma subjects who may benefit from treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors and will allow correlations between IFN- γ gene expression and clinical activity of MEDI4736 in combination with 
tremelimumab to be explored.
During the course of the study, subjects’ tumor samples (archival and/or from fresh biopsies) will be analyzed 
for PD-L1 expression (ie, tumoral vs stromal) that may predict increased frequency of response or longer disease stabilization. The analyses will be performed to see whether there is association between PD-L1 expression levels at baseline and clinical activity. If such association exists, secondary analyses for primary and secondary efficacy endpoints will be conducted in “biomarker positive” and “biomarker negative” 
subpopulations determined by the cut-off point of PD-L1 expression. The impact of baseline prognostic 
factors will be explored as appropriate when treatment arms in the subpopulations are compared.
Safety
The safety analysis will be based on the As-treated Population, and will include AEs, SAEs, laboratory 
evaluations, vital signs, ECGs, and physical examinations from both Phase 1b and Phase 2. In Phase 1b, the number of DLTs that are identified in the DLT Evaluable Population (defined as subjects 
enrolled in Phase 1b who receive the protocol-assigned treatment and complete safety follow-up through the 
DLT evaluation period or experience a DLT during the DLT evaluation period) will be summarized or listed. For both Phase 1b and Phase 2, the number and percentage of subjects reporting treatment-emergent AEs will be summarized overall and by the worst National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) v4.03 grade, system organ class, and preferred term, with a breakdown by treatment arm/dose cohort. Similarly, the number and percentage of subjects reporting treatment-emergent AEs 
considered related to investigational product will be summarized. Laboratory abnormalities will be graded 
according to the NCI CTCAE v4.03, if applicable. Frequencies of worst observed grade will be presented for each laboratory parameter as well as the rates of subjects with Grade 3-4 toxicities. A shift table, presenting the 2-way frequency tabulation for baseline and the worst post-baseline grade, will be provided for clinical laboratory tests.

1.1 Disease Background
1.1.1 Cancer and Immune Function
The importance of the immune system in cancer development and progression has been 
recognized during the past decade ( Hanahan and Weinberg, 2000 ). Failure of immune 
surveillance of pre-neoplastic lesions and micro-metastases is a key step in cancer 
development. Chronically immunosuppressed individuals show higher rates of cancer. This observation led to the hypothesis that sporadic cancers among immune-competent individuals 
are likely to be minimally immunogenic, allowing for passive escape from immune 
surveillance. Recent data suggests that this may be an oversimplification. Some sporadic tumors are highly immunogenic, but actively suppress the local immune environment through production of immunosuppressive cytokines ( Shields et al, 2010 ). As such, the local 
tumor environment is likely a highly dynamic environment where most tumors grow and 
metastasize through adaptive responses that modulate antitumor immunity.
The complexity and redundancy of the immune system offers multiple targets that may be 
manipulated to maximize the body’s inherent immune response to a tumor. Immune response 
may be augmented by directly stimulating effector cells, indirectly stimulating effectors by 
augmenting antigen presentation activity or costimulation, or by suppressing immunosuppressive factors, cells, or messages ( Monti et al, 2005 ).
1.1.2 Immune-checkpoint Inhibition
Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) have the capacity to control the growth of many types 
of cancers ( Gooden et al, 2011 ). Most tumors show infiltration by TILs, but tumors modulate 
the local microenvironment through expression of inhibitory molecules. Engagement of TIL 
cell-surface receptors with these inhibitory ligands leads to a dysfunctional immune response, 
causes T-cell exhaustion, and facilitates tumor progression ( Baitsch et al, 2012 ; 
Crespo et al 2013 ). Novel monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that block these inhibitory 
receptors have shown significant clinical activity across a number of tumor types 
(Wolchok et al, 2009 ; Hodi et al, 2010 ; Robert et al, 2011 ; Brahmer et al, 2010 ; 
Topalian et al, 2012 ). Specifically, blockade of immune-checkpoint inhibitors such as 
cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen  4 (CTLA-4), programmed cell death 1 (PD-1), 
and programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) have shown clinical activity not only in conventionally immune-responsive tumors such as melanoma and renal cell carcinoma but 
also in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC; Brahmer et al, 2010 ; Brahmer et al, 2012 ; 
Topalian et al, 2012 ; Gordon et al, 2013 ), prostate cancer ( Harzstark and Small, 2010 ; 
MedImmune Protocol D4190C00021
MEDI4736 24Jan2017; Amendment 6 Final
20 of 180 Template 16.2Slovin et al, 2013 ), pancreatic cancer ( Royal et al, 2010 ), mesothelioma ( Calabrò et al, 2013 ),
and other solid tumors ( Brahmer et al, 2010 ; Brahmer et al, 2012 ; Gordon et al, 2013 ).
1.2 MEDI4736 and Tremelimumab Background
MEDI4736 and tremelimumab are briefly described below. Refer to the current 
Investigator’s Brochures for details.
1.2.1 MEDI4736 Background
MEDI4736 is a human immunoglobulin G (IgG)-1 kappa monoclonal antibody (mAb)
directed against human PD-L1. MEDI4736 is expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells and 
has an overall molecular weight of approximately 149 kDa. MEDI4736 selectively binds human PD-L1 with high affinity and blocks its ability to bind to PD-1 and cluster of 
differentiation (CD)80. The fragment crystallizable (Fc) domain of MEDI4736 contains a 
triple mutation in the constant domain of the IgG1 heavy chain that reduces binding to the complement component C1q and the Fc gamma receptors responsible for mediating antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC; Oganesyan et al, 2008 ).
1.2.2 Tremelimumab Background
Tremelimumab (formerly CP-675,206) is a human IgG2 mAb being investigated as a cancer 
immunotherapeutic agent. Tremelimumab is expressed in NS0 (murine myeloma) cells and has an overall molecular weight of approximately 149 kDa. Tremelimumab is specific for human CTLA-4, with no cross-reactivity to related human proteins. Tremelimumab blocks 
the inhibitory effect of CTLA-4, and therefore enhances T-cell activation. Tremelimumab 
shows minimal specific binding to Fc receptors, does not induce natural killer (NK) ADCC activity, and does not deliver inhibitory signals following plate-bound aggregation.

1.5 Rationale for Conducting the Study
Unmet Need in Advanced Gastric Cancer
Despite recent advances, the prognosis of patients with advanced gastric cancer remains poor (Kang et al, 2012 ). At present, regimens that combine a platinum and fluorouracil agent 
either alone or in combination with a third drug such as epirubicin or taxane constitute the 
most effective treatment option in the first-line metastatic setting, resulting in a median OS of 
approximately 10 months ( Cunningham et al, 2008 ). In the second-line setting, ramucirumab 
(a vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 antagonist) was recently approved by the 
United States (US) Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and has demonstrated modest activity in patients with advanced gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma who progressed after first-
line platinum- or fluoropyrimidine-containing chemotherapy ( Fuchs et al, 2014 ). Median OS 
was 5.2 months in the ramucirumab group versus 3.8 months in the placebo group. 
Additionally, ramucirumab in combination with paclitaxel was evaluated in the second-line 
setting in the RAINBOW study, in which more than 600 subjects with metastatic gastric or 
GEJ adenocarcinoma that progressed on or within 4 months after first-line platinum- and fluoropyrimidine-based combination therapy were randomized to paclitaxel plus ramucirumab or paclitaxel alone ( Wilke et al, 2014 ). Median OS was 9.63 months and 
7.36 months, respectively. AEs that occurred in ≥20% of subjects (n = 327) treated with 
ramucirumab plus paclitaxel were fatigue (56.9%), neutropenia (54.4%), neuropathy (45.9%), anorexia (40.1%), abdominal pain (36.1%), leukopenia (33.9%), diarrhea (32.4%), 
MedImmune Protocol D4190C00021

31 of 180 Template 16.2epistaxis (30.6%), vomiting (26.9%), hypertension (25.1%), and peripheral edema (25.1%; 
Wilke et al, 2014 ).
An unmet medical need remains for new second- and third-line treatment options that are 
safe and effective in subjects with advanced gastric cancer. Immunotherapies hold much promise in treating this patient population by providing a more favorable safety profile and early signs of clinical activity. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Rationale for MEDI4736 and Tremelimumab Combination Therapy
The rationale for evaluating MEDI4736 in combination with tremelimumab in advanced 
gastric cancer is supported by both nonclinical and clinical data in several other solid tumors.
Mouse models of transplantable solid tumors show superior antitumor activity of 
combination therapy as compared to monotherapy. Furthermore, the CTLA-4 and PD-1/PD-L1 pathways are non-redundant, suggesting that targeting both may have additive 
or synergistic activity. The combination of CTLA-4 and PD-1 blockade in melanoma has 
been shown to result in higher ORRs and 1-year survival than either agent alone (Wolchok et al, 2013 ).

32 of 180 Template 16.2Profile of Adverse Events with Immunotherapy
MEDI4736 monotherapy, tremelimumab monotherapy, and MEDI4736 in combination with 
tremelimumab are currently being evaluated in other studies (see Section 1.4). Overall, the
AE profile is manageable and supports continued clinical development. 
Immune-related adverse events (irAEs) such as diarrhea and colitis have been reported with 
immunotherapies. With the approval of 2 immune checkpoint inhibitors for melanoma 
(ipilimumab [ Hodi et al, 2010 ] and pembrolizumab [ Hamid et al, 2013 ]), there is greater 
recognition of irAEs and management algorithms, including early, aggressive use of steroids, 
and continued improvement in outcome.
Preliminary Efficacy of Immunotherapy in Advanced Gastric Cancer
Immune checkpoint inhibitors such as MEDI4736 and tremelimumab have provided early 
evidence of clinical activity in advanced gastric cancer. Study CD-ON-MEDI4736-1108 includes a cohort that is evaluating MEDI4736 monotherapy in subjects with gastroesophageal cancer ( Segal et al, 2014 ). As of 07May2015, out of 40 evaluable subjects 
with gastroesophageal cancer, there are 2 responses (1 CR and 1 PR). The DCR-24w was
15%. A Phase 2 study of tremelimumab monotherapy in second-line gastroesophageal subjects  demonstrated clinical activity (4 SD, 1 PR; Ralph et al, 2010 ).
Rationale for Patient Selection Based on Tumoral IFN- γ Gene Expression
Signature
Another key objective of the current study is the understanding of potential biomarkers that 
are determinants of response and non-response to MEDI4736 and tremelimumab. Clinical 
trials and preclinical studies have demonstrated the predictive nature of an elevated Type 1 
helper T-cell (Th1) gene signature within the tumor and the subsequent response to immunotherapy for solid tumors ( Ulloa-Montoya et al, 2013 ; Peng et al, 2015 ). IFN-γ is one 
of the hallmark cytokines, both initiating and propagating the Th1 response. Its expression is 
closely tied to other proteins and cytokines within the tumor microenvironment. Based on 
internal investigations, an IFN- γ gene expression panel was identified consisting of 4 genes 
that will be utilized to try and identify a unique population of gastric or GEJ adenocarcinomasubjects who may benefit from treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors and spare those 
who may experience toxicity.

33 of 180 Template 16.2Benefit-risk Evaluation
The emerging data described above demonstrate encouraging clinical activity with 
MEDI4736 and tremelimumab in gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma. These data combined with 
nonclinical data suggesting improved anticancer activity with the MEDI4736 and tremelimumab combination, as compared to either agent alone, make a compelling case for evaluation of this combination in gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma. 
Possible risks are associated with agents such as MEDI4736 and tremelimumab that activate 
the immune system. The occurrence of irAEs, which is either overlapping or greater for each of these drugs when used as monotherapy, is possible. Potential irAEs may be similar to those seen with the use of ipilimumab, nivolumab, or the combination thereof, and may 
include immune-mediated enterocolitis, dermatitis, pneumonitis, hepatitis (hepatotoxicity), 
neurotoxicity, and endocrinopathies ( Hodi et al, 2010 ; Brahmer et al, 2012 ; 
Topalian et al, 2012 ; Wolchok et al, 2013 ). Several strategies have been incorporated in the 
study protocol to mitigate these risks (Section 3.1.5 ).
Summary and Conclusion
The preliminary clinical activity of immune checkpoint inhibitors as monotherapy or 
combination therapy may provide alternative options for subjects with metastatic gastric cancer. Many of the AEs associated with immune checkpoint inhibitors are potentially 
reversible and can be managed (eg, IV steroids for diarrhea [ Weber et al, 2012 ]). 
 
 
In conclusion, immune checkpoint inhibitors may offer patients with advanced gastric cancer 
in the second-line and third-line setting potential clinical benefit. In addition, further PD-L1 expression (tumoral vs stromal) may identify a subset of patients who could benefit. Early 
evaluation of MEDI4736 and tremelimumab combination therapy appears to offer a balance 
between safety and clinical activity.
1.6 Research Hypothesis
MEDI4736 in combination with tremelimumab, MEDI4736 monotherapy, and tremelimumab monotherapy will be safe and demonstrate clinical activity in subjects with metastatic or recurrent gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma.

A total of 6 subjects were enrolled in Phase 1b and treated  
The Phase 1b portion of the study is 
now complete.
Phase 2
Once the MTD or highest protocol-defined dose (in the absence of exceeding the MTD) has 
been defined in Phase 1b, enrollment in Phase 2 will begin. In Phase 2, subjects will be enrolled in 1 of 5 treatment arms, as listed below. Second-line subjects with metastatic or recurrent gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma will be randomized in a 2:2:1 ratio to Arms A, B, or 
C. In parallel, third-line subjects with metastatic or recurrent gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma 
will be enrolled in Arm D. Upon closure of Arms A, B, and C and completion of Arm D, second- and third-line subjects with metastatic or recurrent gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma 
and a positive IFN- γ gene expression signature will be enrolled in Arm E.
•Arm A: MEDI4736 in combination with tremelimumab in second-line subjects with 
metastatic or recurrent gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma

40 of 180 Template 16.2In Phase 2 of the study, PD-L1 expression will be monitored throughout the study so as to 
potentially balance enrollment based on PD-L1 status (as specified in the Laboratory Manual; 
see Section 4.8.2.2 ).
Subjects who are treated with MEDI4736 monotherapy (Arm B) or tremelimumab 
monotherapy (Arm C) may crossover to be treated with MEDI4736 in combination with tremelimumab upon a confirmed progressive disease (PD) under restricted circumstances 
(see Section 3.1.2.4 ). 
Subjects in both Phase 1b and Phase 2 who derived clinical benefit from study treatment 
during the initial 12-month treatment period and who subsequently developed PD during the 12 month follow-up period, will be treated for up to 12 months with the same regimen that 
the subject was given upon initial study entry (see Section 3.1.2.4 ). Dose delays and 
discontinuations to manage clinically significant treatment-related toxicity will be allowed.
All subjects will be evaluated for clinical activity, on a regular basis as specified in the 
protocol (Section 4.2), and their disease status primarily analyzed according to RECIST v1.1. 
Clinical decision making in subjects undergoing treatment will be based on RECIST v1.1 
with modifications. Enrollment into any arm of Phase 2 may be discontinued at the discretion of the sponsor should emerging clinical or nonclinical data suggest that continued treatment may not be beneficial to a given arm.
At the time of this amendment, a total of 89 subjects have been enrolled in Phase 2 in 
Arms A  B  C (  and D . Pre-specified interim analyses performed on Arms A and B showed that the criteria for expansion were met; however,
enrollment into Arms A, B, and C was stopped at the sponsor’s discretion. Based on evolving 
science suggesting that the IFN- γ gene expression signature will better predict responders of 
immunotherapy ( Ulloa-Montoya et al, 2013 ; Peng et al, 2015 ) as well as data from the initial 
portion of the study, it was decided to proceed with MEDI4736 in combination with 
tremelimumab in both second- and third-line subjects with metastatic or recurrent gastric or 
GEJ adenocarcinoma who had a positive IFN- γ gene expression signature. The 
discontinuation of Arms A, B, and C was not due to safety concerns. Arm D has completed.
Dose-Expansion in a Biomarker Selected Population
As of Amendment 6, a new arm (Arm E) of MEDI4736 in combination with tremelimumab 
has been added to evaluate efficacy and safety in subjects with second- and third-line gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma with a positive tumor IFN- γ gene expression signature. Numerous 
clinical trials have demonstrated the predictive nature of a Th1 gene signature and the

All subjects will be followed for survival until the end of 
study (5 years after the last subject is enrolled or the date the study is closed by the sponsor, whichever occurs first). Evaluation of a possible correlation between clinical activity of 
MEDI4736 and tremelimumab in combination and IFN- γ gene expression as well as other 
potential biomarkers (eg, tumoral and stromal PD-L1 expression) will be ongoing throughout the study.
The endpoints to be measured in this study are described in Section 2.2.

44 of 180 Template 16.23.1.2.4 Criteria for Treatment Beyond Progression, Crossover, and Retreatment in 
the Follow-up Period
Treatment Beyond Progression
For subjects in all arms and treatment periods, if PD (based on RECIST v1.1) occurs before 
completion of the treatment period, the subject may continue to be treated with the regimen 
they initially received after study enrollment (unless they have crossed over to the combination regimen at which time the subject would continue the combination regimen) until one of the following criteria is met:
1. Confirmed PD: The assessment of PD by RECIST v1.1 (baseline PD assessment) will be 
confirmed by a repeat evaluation at the next tumor assessment time point, but no sooner than 4 weeks later. If any subsequent tumor assessment time point shows ≥ 20% increase 
in the overall tumor burden (the sum of diameters of target lesions and new lesions), when compared to the baseline PD assessment (the sum of diameters of target lesions and new lesions), the subject would be deemed as having confirmed PD. 
a. Note: Subjects in Arm B (MEDI4736 monotherapy) and Arm C (tremelimumab 
monotherapy) of Phase 2 who experience a confirmed PD (as defined above) will have the option (on a case-by-case basis) to crossover to treatment with MEDI4736 in combination with tremelimumab (using the Phase 2 schedule) for 12 months or until a second confirmed PD. Crossover will be permitted as long as the treatment beyond progression criteria are met and any of the investigational product discontinuation criteria (with the exception of criterion number 10 in Section 4.1.6 ) are not met. If 
crossover is not chosen by the investigator, then the study treatment must be discontinued.
b. Note: Subjects with confirmed PD during 12 months of treatment with MEDI4736 in 
combination with tremelimumab (Phase 1b, and Arms A and D, and E of Phase 2) may not crossover to either MEDI4736 monotherapy or tremelimumab monotherapy at any time. Subjects enrolled in Phase 1b, and Arms A, D, and E of Phase 2 who exhibit confirmed PD after completing the planned 4 doses of combination treatment, but prior to completing the 12-month dosing period (ie, while receiving MEDI4736 monotherapy) may be eligible for reinduction (on a case-by-case basis) with combination therapy and continued treatment for an additional 12 months (or until the subject meets any of the discontinuation criteria listed below). The subject would be readministered investigational products according to the same treatment guidelines followed during their initial treatment. Subjects who are enrolled in Phase 1b and Arms A, D, and E of Phase 2 and who exhibit disease progression prior to completing the planned 4 doses of combination treatment may be eligible for continued treatment through the end of the planned 12-month treatment period (or until the subject meets any of the discontinuation criteria listed below), but will not be eligible for reinduction.
2. Meets any of the investigational product discontinuation criteria (Section 4.1.6 ).
3. Clinical symptoms or signs indicating clinically significant PD such as the benefit-risk 
ratio of continuing therapy is no longer justified.
MedImmune Protocol D4190C00021
MEDI4736 24Jan2017; Amendment 6 Final
45 of 180 Template 16.24. Decline in Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status compared 
to baseline.
5. Rapid PD or threat to vital organs/critical anatomical sites (eg, spinal cord compression) 
requiring urgent alternative medical intervention, and/or continuation of study therapy would prevent institution of such intervention.
Retreatment for Subjects Who Enter Follow-up
Subjects enrolled in both Phase 1b and Phase 2 who achieve and maintain DC (ie, CR, PR, or 
SD) through the end of the initial 12-month treatment period will enter a follow-up period. 
Only those subjects who progress during the initial 12 months of the follow-up period will be eligible for retreatment for up to 12 months with the same regimen that the subject was given upon initial study entry. As there is preliminary data from other immunotherapy studies that 
subjects who initially derive clinical benefit from immunotherapy can derive benefit again 
once the subject has PD while off therapy ( Wolchok et al, 2013 ; Hamid et al, 2013 ), the 
protocol will allow retreatment during the follow-up period with the same regimen that the 
subjects received when initially enrolled in the study if all the following criteria are met:
1. Has not received other anticancer treatments for their disease.
2. Does not meet any of the investigational product discontinuation criteria (Section 4.1.6 ).
3. Absence of clinical symptoms or signs indicating clinically significant disease 
progression.
4. No decline in ECOG performance status compared to baseline.5. Absence of rapid PD or threat to vital organs/critical anatomical sites (eg, spinal cord 
compression) requiring urgent alternative medical intervention.
6. All AEs while receiving initial therapy must have resolved to ≤ Grade 1 or baseline. Must 
not have experienced a ≥ Grade 3 AE or neurologic or ocular AE of any grade while 
receiving initial therapy. Note: Subjects with an endocrine AE of any grade are permitted to be retreated if they are stably maintained on appropriate replacement therapy and are asymptomatic.
7. Must not have used additional immunosuppression other than corticosteroids for the 
management of an AE, must not have experienced recurrence of an AE if re-challenged, and not currently require maintenance doses > 10 mg prednisone or equivalent per day.
Subjects will be made aware of the potential benefits and risks of continuing the study 
regimens in the setting of PD by providing separate written informed consent.
3.1.3 Phase 1b ……….
The Phase 1b portion of the study has been described in Section 3.1.1 .
A total of 6 subjects were enrolled in Phase 1b; this portion of the study is now complete.

Dose-limiting toxicity will be evaluated during the DLT evaluation period in Phase 1b. 
 
 
 
 
 
Subjects who do not remain on the study up to this time for reasons other than DLT will be 
replaced with another subject at the same dose level. Dose-limiting toxicity will be graded 
according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) v4.03.
A DLT will be defined as any Grade 3 or higher toxicity that occurs during the DLT 
evaluation period. Toxicity that is clearly and directly related to the primary disease or to 
another etiology is excluded from this definition. The following will be DLTs:
•Any Grade 4 irAE
•Any ≥ Grade 3 colitis
•Any Grade 3 or 4 noninfectious pneumonitis irrespective of duration
•Any Grade 2 pneumonitis that does not resolve to ≤ Grade 1 within 3 days of the 
initiation of maximal supportive care
•Any Grade 3 irAE, excluding colitis or pneumonitis, that does not downgrade to Grade 2 within 3 days after onset of the event despite optimal medical management including 
systemic corticosteroids or does not downgrade to ≤ Grade 1 or baseline within 14 days
•Liver transaminase elevation > 8 × ULN or total bilirubin > 5 × ULN
•Any ≥ Grade 3 non-irAE, except for the exclusions listed below
The definition excludes the following conditions: 
•Grade 3 fatigue lasting ≤ 7 days
•Grade 3 endocrine disorder (thyroid, pituitary, and/or adrenal insufficiency) that is 
managed with or without systemic corticosteroid therapy and/or hormone replacement 
therapy and the subject is asymptomatic
•Grade 3 inflammatory reaction attributed to a local antitumor response (eg, inflammatory 
reaction at sites of metastatic disease, lymph nodes, etc)
MedImmune Protocol D4190C00021
MEDI4736 24Jan2017; Amendment 6 Final
48 of 180 Template 16.2•Concurrent vitiligo or alopecia of any AE grade
•Grade 3 infusion-related reaction (first occurrence and in the absence of steroid 
prophylaxis) that resolves within 6 hours with appropriate clinical management
•Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia that is not associated with fever or systemic infection that improves by at least 1 grade within 3 days. Grade 3 or Grade 4 febrile neutropenia will be 
a DLT regardless of duration or reversibility
•Grade 3 or 4 lymphopenia
•Grade 3 thrombocytopenia that is not associated with clinically significant bleeding that requires medical intervention, and improves by at least 1 grade within 3 days
•Isolated Grade 3 elevations in amylase and/or lipase that are not associated with clinical 
signs or symptoms or radiographic features suggestive of pancreatitis 
•Isolated Grade 3 electrolyte abnormalities that are not associated with clinical signs or symptoms and are reversed with appropriate maximal medical intervention within 3 days
Immune-related AEs are defined as AEs of an immune nature (ie, inflammatory) in the 
absence of a clear alternative etiology. In the absence of a clinically significant abnormality, 
repeat laboratory testing will be conducted to confirm significant laboratory findings prior to designation as a DLT.
While the rules for adjudicating DLTs in the context of dose escalation specified above, an 
AE not listed above may be defined as a DLT after a consultation with the sponsor and 
investigators, based on the emerging safety profile.
3.1.3.3 Maximum Tolerated Dose
The MTD is defined as the highest dose within a cohort where no more than 1 of 6 subjects(or less than one-third of subjects if the cohort is larger than 6 subjects) experiences a DLT. This will be determined during Phase 1b based on the assessment of DLT during the DLT 
evaluation period, as defined in Section 3.1.3.2 .

MEDI4736 24Jan2017; Amendment 6 Final
49 of 180 Template 16.23.1.4 Phase 2 ……….
At the time of this amendment, a total of  subjects have been enrolled in Phase 2 in 
Arms A  B  C  and D  Pre-specified interim analyses 
performed on Arms A and B showed that the criteria for expansion were met; however,
enrollment to Arms A, B, and C was stopped at the sponsor’s discretion. It was decided to proceed with MEDI4736 in combination with tremelimumab only in second- and third-line subjects with metastatic or recurrent gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma who had a positive 
IFN-γ gene expression signature. The discontinuation of Arms A, B, and C was not due to 
safety concerns. Arm D has completed.
As described in Section 3.1.1 , Phase 2 will include the following 5 treatment arms:
•Arm A: MEDI4736 in combination with tremelimumab in second-line subjects with 
metastatic or recurrent gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma
•Arm B: MEDI4736 monotherapy in second-line subjects with metastatic or recurrent gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma 
•Arm C: Tremelimumab monotherapy in second-line subjects with metastatic or recurrent gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma )
•Arm D: MEDI4736 in combination with tremelimumab in third-line subjects with metastatic or recurrent gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma
•Arm E (as of Amendment 6): MEDI4736 in combination with tremelimumab in second-and third-line subjects with metastatic or recurrent gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma and a 
positive IFN- γ gene expression signature 
During Phase 2, subjects will be monitored continuously for safety according to the same 
criteria employed during Phase 1b. If during the treatment period, ≥ 33% of subjects 
experience safety events meeting DLT criteria, even if outside of the DLT evaluation period 
(see Section 3.1.3.2 ), enrollment may be paused and study data will be reviewed to determine 
whether additional monitoring or alternate dose levels or treatment schedules should be evaluated prior to further enrollment. In addition, after the first 20 subjects have been dosed with MEDI4736 in combination with tremelimumab for a minimum of 6 weeks (in both 
second- and third-line settings), safety data will be reviewed by the sponsor.
3.1.5 Management of Study Medication Related Toxicities
Based on the mechanism of action of MEDI4736 and tremelimumab leading to T-cell 
activation and proliferation, there is the possibility of observing irAEs during the conduct of 
this study. Potential irAEs may be similar to those seen with the use of ipilimumab, 
nivolumab, and BMS-936559 and may include immune-mediated enterocolitis, dermatitis, 
MedImmune Protocol D4190C00021
MEDI4736 24Jan2017; Amendment 6 Final
50 of 180 Template 16.2hepatitis, and endocrinopathies ( Hodi et al, 2010; Brahmer et al, 2012 ; Topalian et al 2012; 
Wolchok et al, 2013 ). Subjects should be monitored for signs and symptoms of irAEs. In the 
absence of an alternate etiology (eg, infection or PD), an immune-related etiology should be 
considered for signs or symptoms of enterocolitis, dermatitis, hepatitis, and endocrinopathy. In addition to the dose modifications shown in Appendix 5 , it is recommended that 
management of irAEs follow the guidelines outlined for ipilimumab ( Weber J et al, 2012 ). 
If the investigator has any question in regards to an AE being an irAE, the investigator 
should immediately contact the medical monitor. Dose modifications may be required for AEs that are clearly not attributed to MEDI4736 or tremelimumab (such as an accident) or for laboratory abnormalities that are deemed asymptomatic, require no intervention, and are 
documented in the medical records. Laboratory abnormalities that are felt to meet these 
criteria must be discussed and agreed on by the medical monitor before treatment can be continued. Dose reductions of MEDI4736 and tremelimumab are not permitted.
Dose interruptions of MEDI4736 and tremelimumab may be required in the event of 
treatment-related toxicity. General guidelines regarding dose modifications are provided in
Appendix 5 . In addition, management guidelines for AESIs are detailed in Section 5.3. All 
toxicities will be graded according to NCI CTCAE v4.03. In case of doubt the investigator should consult with the medical monitor.

3.2.2 Rationale for Study Population
The proposed study population, comprising adult subjects with metastatic or recurrent gastric 
or GEJ adenocarcinoma that have progressed during or after 1 or 2 prior standard regimens
for recurrent or metastatic disease, represents a high unmet medical need. This tumor indication, described below, presents an opportunity for novel treatment approaches that may lead to improved clinical outcomes.
In 2014, it is estimated that 22,220 and 18,170 people will be newly diagnosed with gastric 
cancer and esophageal cancer, respectively, whereas 26,440 individuals will die due to upper GI tumors ( Siegel et al, 2014 ). Gastroesophageal cancer remains endemic in many parts of 
the world, with an estimated new cancer incidence of 1,471,000 people or 11.6% of the 
global cancer burden and an annual death rate of 1,144,000 people or 15.1% of cancer-related deaths worldwide ( Ferlay et al, 2010 ). Globally, gastric cancer is the second 
leading cause of cancer-related mortality ( Luis et al, 2013 ). 
Current therapeutic strategies for advanced gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma are limited, and 
survival rarely exceeds 1 year despite aggressive treatment with chemotherapy. A number of different drugs (eg, alkylating agents, platinum compounds, 5-fluorouracil [5-FU], and taxanes) are available for the treatment of gastroesophageal cancer, but no means of selecting 
therapy based on the tumor biology is currently available. At present, the combination of a 
MedImmune Protocol D4190C00021
MEDI4736 24Jan2017; Amendment 6 Final
53 of 180 Template 16.2platinum and fluorouracil agent either alone or in combination with a third drug such as 
epirubicin or taxane constitutes the most effective treatment option in the first-line metastatic 
setting ( Cunningham et al, 2008 ). Standard first-line options include docetaxel, cisplatin, and 
5-FU; epirubicin, cisplatin, and capecitabine/epirubicin, oxaliplatin, and capecitabine; or 
folinic acid, 5-FU, and oxaliplatin. 
The vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 antagonist, ramucirumab, as evaluated in 
the REGARD study and recently approved by th e US FDA, has demonstrated modest activity 
in subjects with advanced gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma who progressed after first-line platinum- or fluoropyrimidine-containing chemotherapy ( Fuchs et al, 2014 ). Median OS was 
5.2 months in the ramucirumab group versus 3.8 months in the placebo group (HR 0.776, 
95% confidence interval [CI], 0.603-0.998; p = 0.047). In the RAINBOW study, more than 
600 subjects with metastatic gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma who had disease progression on or within 4 months after first-line platinum- and fluoropyrimidine-based combination therapy were randomized to paclitaxel plus ramucirumab or paclitaxel alone ( Wilke et al, 2014 ).
Median OS was 9.63 months and 7.36 months, respectively (HR 0.807; 95% CI, 0.678-0.962; 
p = 0.017), and median PFS was 4.40 and 2.86 months, respectively (HR 0.635; 95% CI, 0.536-0.752; p < 0.0001). Median time to progression was 5.5 months with ramucirumab plus paclitaxel versus 3.0 months with paclitaxel alone (p < 0.0001), and ORR was 28% 
versus 16%, respectively (p = 0.0001). Based on these results, the combination of 
ramucirumab plus paclitaxel is expected to become the standard of care in the second-line setting for metastatic upper GI tumors.
Additional FDA-approved second-line agents include docetaxel and irinotecan. In the 
COUGAR-02 study, median OS was 5.2 months with docetaxel compared with 3.6 months with best supportive care (BSC; HR 0.67; 95% CI, 0.49–0.92; p = 0.01; Ford et al, 2014 ). 
Kang and colleagues evaluated chemotherapy (docetaxel 60 mg/m2every 3 weeks or 
irinotecan 150 mg/m2Q2W) plus BSC versus BSC alone in subjects with advanced gastric 
cancer who received 1 or 2 prior fluoropyrimidine- and platinum-based chemotherapy regimens ( Kang et al, 2012 ). The median OS was 5.3 months with chemotherapy plus BSC 
(n = 133) versus 3.8 months with BSC alone (n = 69; HR 0.657; 95% CI, 0.485-0.891; 
p = 0.007). There was no median OS difference between docetaxel and irinotecan (5.2 versus
6.5 months, respectively; p = 0.116). Despite these advances, the toxicity profile of second-line agents is poor and survival is still between 6 to 9 months. Consequently, immunotherapies hold potential promise in this setting.
To date, a number of Asian studies have investigated PD-L1 expression in gastric cancer. 
Zheng and colleagues evaluated 80 advanced gastric cancer subjects and 40 healthy controls. 
MedImmune Protocol D4190C00021
MEDI4736 24Jan2017; Amendment 6 Final
54 of 180 Template 16.2They reported significant upregulation of PD-L1 in advanced gastric cancer patients 
compared with healthy people (p = 0.006; Zheng et al, 2014 ). The expression of PD-L1 was 
significantly correlated with differentiation (p = 0.026) and lymph node metastasis 
(p = 0.041). Wu and colleagues examined PD-L1 expression in cases of human gastric carcinoma (n = 102), adenoma (n = 10), and normal tissues (n = 10; Wu et al, 2006 ). 
Programmed cell death ligand 1 was not detected in normal gastric tissues, and very weak 
immunodetection in gastric adenomas, but PD-L1 was detected in 42.2% of gastric 
carcinoma tissues. There was no correlation between PD-L1 immunolocalization and patient age, sex, tumor location, or the degree of tumor differentiation in gastric carcinomas. However, PD-L1 immunodetection was significantly correlated with tumor size, invasion, 
lymph node metastasis, and survival time. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that PD-L1 
immunodetection could be used as an independent factor to evaluate the prognosis of gastric carcinoma. 
3.2.3 Rationale for Endpoints
Safety
Standard safety parameters (AEs, SAEs, laboratory evaluations, vital signs, ECGs, and 
physical examinations) will be employed to assess the safety profile of MEDI4736 in combination with tremelimumab, MEDI4736 monotherapy, and tremelimumab monotherapy.
Primary and Secondary Efficacy Assessments
OR and DC as assessed by RECIST v1.1 ( Eisenhauer et al, 2009 ) per blinded central review, 
are standard measures of clinical activity. OS is considered the “gold standard” for 
quantifying clinical benefit, with PFS being an acceptable surrogate. In the Phase 2 portion of 
the study, blinded central review will be performed to confirm response data. 
Tumoral IFN- γ Gene Expression Signature
Clinical trials and preclinical studies have demonstrated the predictive nature of an elevated 
Th1 gene signature within the tumor and the subsequent response to immunotherapy for solid 
tumors ( Ulloa-Montoya et al, 2013 ; Peng et al, 2015 ). IFN-γ is one of the hallmark cytokines, 
both initiating and propagating the Th1 response. Its expression is closely tied to other 
proteins and cytokines within the tumor microenvironment. Based on internal investigations, an IFN-γ gene expression panel was identified consisting of 4 genes that will be utilized to 
try and identify a unique population of gastr ic or GEJ adenocarcinoma subjects who may 
benefit from treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors and to identify correlations between IFN- γ gene expression and clinical activity of MEDI4736 in combination with

cohorts; retrospective testing will be performed as necessary.
PD-L1 Expression
In Study CD-ON-MEDI4736-1108, as of 21Aug2014, the DCR at 12 weeks (DCR-12w) was 
33% (115/352 subjects) and ORR was 10% (36/352 subjects) in subjects (across 8 tumor types) treated with MEDI4736 10 mg/kg Q2W ( Segal et al, 2014 ). Greater DCR-12w (47% 
vs 28%) and ORR (22% vs 5%) were observed in PD-L1-positive versus PD-L1-negative 
subjects, based on a proprietary IHC assay which detects PD-L1 staining on tumor cells.
Of the 41 subjects with gastroesophageal cancer who have been dosed in 
Study CD-ON-MEDI4736-1108, 28 were evaluable for efficacy analysis ( Segal et al, 2014 ). 
In these subjects, DCR-12w was 25% (7/28 subjects).

4.1 Subjects
4.1.1 Number of Subjects
Up to approximately 135 subjects in Phase 1b/2 will be enrolled at up to approximately 
40 study centers globally. Additional subjects may be enrolled if dose de-escalation is 
required or intermediate dose levels are explored.
4.1.2 Inclusion Criteria
Subjects must meet all of the following criteria:
1. Male or female subjects; age ≥ 18 years at the time of screening or age of consent 
according to local law.
2. Written informed consent and any locally required authorization, Health Insurance and 
Portability and Accountability Act in the US, European Union (EU) Data Privacy Directive in the EU obtained from the subject/legal representative prior to performing any protocol-related procedures, including screening evaluations.
3. ECOG performance status of 0 or 1. 4. Histologically or cytologically confirmed metastatic or recurrent gastric or GEJ 
adenocarcinomas. Note: GEJ adenocarcinomas are defined as tumors that have their center within 5 cm proximal and distal of the anatomical cardia, as described in the Siewert classification system ( Siewert et al, 2000 ).
5. Prior lines of therapy:
a. For Phase 1b: Must have received and have progressed, or are refractory to one
systemic platinum- or fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy regimen for metastatic or recurrent disease.
b. For Arms A, B, and C of Phase 2: Must have received and have progressed, or are 
refractory to one systemic platinum- or fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy 
regimen for metastatic or recurrent disease, or 
Must have received and have progressed, or are refractory to one systemic platinum 
or fluoropyrimidine-based therapy as part of neoadjuvant or adjuvant regimen with relapse within 6 months of therapy.

two systemic regimens (one standard platinum- or fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy regimen and one approved regimen) for metastatic or recurrent disease.
MedImmune Protocol D4190C00021
MEDI4736 24Jan2017; Amendment 6 Final
60 of 180 Template 16.2d. For Arm E of Phase 2: Subjects with a positive IFN- γ gene expression signature (as
defined in Section 4.3.8.1 ) must have received and have progressed, or are refractory 
to one systemic platinum- or fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy regimen formetastatic or recurrent disease, or 
Must have received and have progressed, or are refractory to one systemic platinum-
or fluoropyrimidine-based therapy as part of neoadjuvant or adjuvant regimen with relapse within 6 months of therapy, or
Must have received and have progressed, or are refractory to two systemic regimens 
(one standard platinum- or fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy regimen and one approved regimen for metastatic or recurrent disease).
e. Subjects who have received and have progressed, or are refractory to one systemic 
platinum- or fluoropyrimidine-based therapy as part of neoadjuvant or adjuvant regimen with relapse within 6 months will count as a line of therapy in the metastatic/recurrent setting.
6. Screening for IFN- γexpression prior to Arm E enrollment:
a. Subjects who are being considered for enrollment on Arm E may undergo 
pre-screening for IFN- γ gene expression either at the time of disease progression or 
after having completed a minimum of 60 days of the prior line of systemic therapy. In addition, they should meet all other eligibility criteria for enrollment, with the exception of prior lines of therapy if they are being screened during first-or second-line treatment.
b. Subjects enrolling to Arm E must consent to provide archival tumor tissue for IFN- γ
testing. Only subjects with a positive IFN- γgene expression signature (as defined in 
Section 4.3.8.1 ) will be eligible for enrollment to Arm E. IFN- γtesting must be 
completed to determine enrollment eligibility prior to initiation of therapy. If eligible, subjects must consent to initial and subsequent tumor biopsy samples, if possible.
7. Subjects must have at least one measurable lesion according to RECIST v1.1. 
a. A previously irradiated lesion can be considered a target lesion if the lesion is well 
defined, measurable and there is objective evidence of interval increase in size.
8. Subjects must have at least one lesion amenable to biopsy and must consent to and 
provide both pre-treatment and on-treatment tumor biopsies for Phase 2 (optional for Phase 1b). Fresh tumor biopsies should be preferentially obtained from tumor tissues that are safely accessible as determined by the investigator and achieved via non-significant risk procedures (refer to Section 4.3.2.1 ). Tumor lesions used for biopsy should not be 
lesions used as RECIST target lesions. Sites are encouraged to confirm adequacy of tumor biopsy material at the time of the procedure. 
9. Subjects must consent to provide archival tumor tissue (initial and subsequent tumor 
biopsy samples, if possible) for correlative biomarker studies (for both Phase 1b and 2), if available. Availability of tissue for transfer to sponsor should be confirmed prior to initiation of study therapy.
10. Adequate organ and marrow function, as defined below. Criteria “a,” “b,” and “c” cannot 
be met with ongoing or recent blood transfusions (within 14 days of starting first dose) or require growth factor support (within 28 days of starting the first dose)
a. Hemoglobin ≥ 8 g/dL

61 of 180 Template 16.2b. Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,500/μL
c. Platelet count ≥ 100,000/ μL
d. Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 × ULN except subjects with documented Gilbert’s syndrome 
(> 3 × ULN)
e. ALT and AST ≤ 3×  U L N
f. Calculated creatinine clearance ≥50 mL/minute as determined by Cockcroft-Gault

11. Female patients of child-bearing potential: Female subjects of childbearing potential who 
are sexually active with a non-sterilized male partner must use at least one highly
effective method of contraception ( Table 4.1.2-1 ) from the time of screening, and must 
agree to continue using such precautions for 180 days after the last dose of MEDI4736 + tremelimumab combination therapy or 90 days after the last dose of MEDI4736monotherapy. Non-sterilised male partners of a female subject must use male condom plus spermicide throughout this period. Cessation of birth control after this point should be discussed with a responsible physician. Not engaging in sexual activity for the total duration of the drug treatment and the drug washout period is an acceptable practice; however, periodic abstinence, the rhythm method, and the withdrawal method are not acceptable methods of contraception. Female subjects should refrain from breastfeeding throughout this period.
a. Females of childbearing potential are defined as those who are not surgically sterile 
(ie, bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy, or complete hysterectomy) or post-menopausalWomen will be considered post-menopausal if they have been amenorrheic for 12 months without an alternative medical cause. The following age-specific requirements apply:
i. Women < 50 years of age would be considered post-menopausal if they have been 
amenorrheic for 12 months or more following cessation of exogenous hormonal treatments and if they have luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone levels in the post-menopausal range for the institution or underwent surgical sterilization (bilateral oophorectomy or hysterectomy). 
ii. Women ≥50 years of age would be considered post-menopausal if they have been 
amenorrheic for 12 months or more following cessation of all exogenous hormonal treatments, had radiation-induced menopause with last menses > 1 year ago, had chemotherapy-induced menopause with last menses > 1 year ago, or underwent surgical sterilization (bilateral oophorectomy, bilateral salpingectomy or hysterectomy).
b. Highly effective methods of contraception, defined as one that results in a low failure 
rate (ie, less than 1% per year) when used consistently and correctly are described in Table 4.1.2-1 . Note that some contraception methods are not considered highly 
effective (eg, male or female condom with or without spermicide; female cap, diaphragm, or sponge with or without spermicide; non-copper containing intrauterine device; progestogen-only oral hormonal contraceptive pills where inhibition of ovulation is not the primary mode of action [excluding Cerazette/desogestrel which is considered highly effective]; and triphasic combined oral contraceptive pills).

62 of 180 Template 16.212. Male patients with a female partner of childbearing potential
a. Non-sterilized male subjects who are sexually active with a female partner of 
childbearing potential must use male condom plus spermicide from screening through 180 days after receipt of the final dose of MEDI4736 + tremelimumab combination therapy or 90 days after receipt of the final dose of MEDI4736 monotherapy. Not engaging in sexual activity is an acceptable practice; however, occasional abstinence, the rhythm method, and the withdrawal method are not acceptable methods of contraception. Male subjects should refrain from sperm donation throughout this period. 
b. Female partners (of childbearing potential) of a male subject must use a highly 
effective method of contraception throughout this period ( Table 4.1.2-1 ).

evaluation of the investigational products or interpretation of subject safety or study results.
20. Subjects who are involuntarily incarcerated or are unable to willingly provide consent or 
are unable to comply with the protocol procedures.
4.1.4 Subject Enrollment and Randomization
Study participation begins (ie, a subject is “enrolled”) once written informed consent is 
obtained. Once informed consent is obtained, a subject identification (SID) number will be 
assigned by a central system (eg, an interactive response system [IXRS]), and the pre-screening/screening evaluations may begin to assess study eligibility 
MedImmune Protocol D4190C00021
MEDI4736 24Jan2017; Amendment 6 Final
65 of 180 Template 16.2(inclusion/exclusion) criteria. The SID number will be used to identify the subject during the 
pre-screening/screening process and throughout study participation. 
A master log of all consented subjects will be maintained at the site and will document all 
screening failures (ie, subjects who are consented but do not meet study eligibility criteria), including the reason(s) for screening failure.
Subjects who fail to meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria (ie, screening failures) should not 
receive investigational products. There can be no exceptions to this rule. Subjects who are 
screening failures should be withdrawn from the study.
4.1.5 Withdrawal from the Study
Subjects are free to withdraw their consent to participate in the study (investigational product 
and assessments) at any time without prejudice to further treatment. Subjects who withdraw 
consent will be asked about the reason(s) and the presence of any AEs. If the subject is
willing, the subject will be seen and assessed by the investigator. AEs will be followed up. If a subject withdraws from further participation in the study, then no further study visits or data collection should take place.
4.1.6 Discontinuation of Investigational Product
An individual subject will not receive any further investigational product(s) if any of the 
following occur in the subject in question:
1. Withdrawal of consent from further participation in the study
2. Lost to follow-up3. An AE that, in the opinion of the investigator or the sponsor, contraindicates further 
dosing
4. Subject experienced an AE that meets the criteria for a DLT during the DLT evaluation 
period (for Phase 1b and Phase 2; see Section 3.1.3.2 for definition of DLT)
5. Subject experienced an AE that meets the criteria for a DLT, except its occurrence is 
outside the DLT evaluation period (for Phase 1b and Phase 2; see Section 3.1.3.2 for 
definition of DLT)
6. Any AE that meets criteria for discontinuation as defined in Section 3.1.5
7. Subject is determined to have met one or more of the exclusion criteria for study 
participation at study entry and continuing investigational product(s) might constitute a safety risk
8. Pregnancy or intent to become pregnant9. Subject noncompliance that, in the opinion of the investigator or sponsor, warrants 
withdrawal (eg, refusal to adhere to scheduled visits)
MedImmune Protocol D4190C00021
MEDI4736 24Jan2017; Amendment 6 Final
66 of 180 Template 16.210. Initiation of alternative anticancer therapy including another investigational agent
11. Confirmed PD and all retreatment criteria in the setting of PD are not met (Section 3.1.2 )
Subjects who are permanently discontinued from receiving investigational product(s) 
regardless of the reason (withdrawal of consent from further treatment, due to an AE, other), 
will be identified as having permanently discontinued treatment and will be followed for 
protocol-specified assessments including follow-up of any AEs unless consent is withdrawn specifically from further study participation; the subject is lost to follow-up; the subject starts alternative anticancer treatment; or the subject is enrolled in another clinical study. All 
subjects will be followed for survival until the end of the study. Subjects who decline to 
return to the site for evaluations should be contacted by phone every 3 months to assess for survival unless consent is withdrawn.
4.1.7 Replacement of Subjects
Phase 1b subjects who are not evaluable for DLT assessment will be replaced. Subjects in 
Phase 2 will not be replaced.
4.1.8 Withdrawal of Informed Consent for Data and Biological Samples
Biological Samples Obtained for the Main Study
Study data are protected by the use of an SID number, which is a number specific to the 
subject. The investigator is in control of the information that is needed to connect a study 
sample to a subject. A subject’s consent to the use of data does not have a specific expiration 
date, but the subject may withdraw consent at any time by notifying the investigator. If 
consent is withdrawn, any samples collected prior to that time may still be given to and used 
by the sponsor but no new data or samples will be collected unless specifically required to 
monitor safety of the subject.
Samples Obtained for Genetic Research or Future Research
Samples obtained for genetic research or future research will be labeled with a sample 
identification number linked to the SID number but will not be labeled with personal 
identifiers such as the subject’s name. If the subject withdraws consent for participating in the genetic research or future research, the sponsor will locate the subject’s sample and destroy it. The coding of samples and results is to ensure that these research results are kept 
confidential by keeping the subject’s identity and these results separate. 
MedImmune Protocol D4190C00021
MEDI4736 24Jan2017; Amendment 6 Final
67 of 180 Template 16.2If the subject consents to have his/her sample(s) used for genetic research or future research, 
this additional research may not start immediately and may start at any time during the 
storage period. The subject’s sample(s) including any specimens of extracted DNA will be 
stored by the sponsor with similar samples from other subjects at a secure central laboratory. The subject’s samples will not be kept for more than 25 years after the end of the study in which they were collected. If the subject chooses not to allow his/her study samples to be 
used for genetic research or future research, the samples will be destroyed by the sponsor 
once they are no longer required for the main study.
If consent is withdrawn after a sample has been taken but before the subject’s sample is sent 
to the sponsor for genetic research or future research, the investigator will arrange to have it 
destroyed. If consent is withdrawn after the subject’s sample(s) have been sent to the sponsor 
for genetic research or future research, the sponsor and the investigator will ensure that these sample(s) are destroyed unless the sample identification number has been removed and the subject can no longer be linked to any sample(s). However, if the subject’s samples have 
already been used for research, the sponsor is not required to destroy results of this research. 
In this case only the remaining sample(s) will be destroyed.
4.2 Schedule of Study Procedures
4.2.1 Enrollment/Screening Period
Table 4.2.1-1 shows all procedures to be conducted at the screening visit. Screening 
procedures are required for subjects at initial enrollment and prior to re-treatment; repeated screening is not required for subjects who crossover from monotherapy to combination therapy or for subjects who enter reinduction.

Procedures to be conducted during the treatment period are presented in Table 4.2.2-1 for 
Weeks 1 to 25 and in Table 4.2.2-2 for Week 27 to end of treatment. This schedule of 
assessments will be followed for the initial Week 1 to 25 treatment period, if subjects enter 
reinduction, if subjects enter retreatment, or if subjects are allowed to crossover. At study visits when subjects do not receive investigational product, all of the pre-treatment assessments will be performed.
The timing of ECGs and vital sign assessments should be such that it allows the blood draw 
to occur at the exact nominal time. All samples are collected pre-dose 
unless otherwise indicated.

Table 4.2.3-1 shows all procedures to be conducted during the end of treatment visit and 
follow-up period. For subjects who complete all 12 months of treatment, the last dosing visit 
within the 12-month period is considered to be the end of treatment visit. Subjects who 
discontinue before 12 months will complete the end of treatment visit at the time the decision is made to discontinue treatment.
All subjects are to complete the end of treatment visit, all follow-up visits and be contacted 
for survival status in accordance with the Schedule of Study Procedures. However, if a 
subject discontinues from treatment and moves onto alternative anticancer treatment, the follow-up visits will no longer be required; however, survival follow-up assessments would be required as indicated in the Schedule of Study Procedures unless the subject withdraws 
consent for further survival follow-up. Survival follow-up will continue until the end of study 
as defined in Section 6.3.
After 90 days, only subjects with investigational product-related SAEs will continue to be 
followed for safety.

80 of 180 Template 16.24.3 Description of Study Procedures
4.3.1 Efficacy ……….
Tumor assessments will be based on RECIST v1.1 ( Eisenhauer et al, 2009 ) and will be 
performed according to the schedule presented in Section 4.2. All subjects will be followed 
for survival according to the schedule in Table 4.2.3-1 through the end of the study (defined 
as 5 years after the final subject is enrolled or the sponsor stops the study, whichever occurs first). 
Sites will be required to store electronic copies of all scans, and the sponsor will arrange for 
centralized storage of all imaging data. All imaging assessments, including unscheduled visit scans, will be collected on an ongoing basis and sent to the sponsor or designee for storage. 
The centralized storage of imaging data will occur for independent centralized third-party 
blinded review of disease assessments. At the discretion of the sponsor, an independent central review of all scans used in the assessment of tumors by RECIST v1.1 for the Phase 2 portion of the study will be conducted. Guidelines for imaging collection and storage will be 
provided in a separate document. The management of subjects will be based solely upon the 
results of assessment conducted by the investigator based on RECIST v1.1 per protocol.
Tumor assessments should include the following evaluations: physical examination and CT 
or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis (pelvic scan is 
optional unless known pelvic disease is present at baseline). CT or MRI scans of the head 
and neck will be performed on all subjects at screening; follow-up head and neck scans are optional unless disease is found on the screening examination or clinically indicated. MRIscan of the brain will be performed on all subjects at screening. If the subject has CNS 
metastases, a brain MRI is also required at each post baseline assessment. If a subject 
becomes neurologically symptomatic during treatment outside of the setting where the subject has known CNS metastases, a brain MRI is required.
The preferred method of disease assessment is CT with contrast. If CT with contrast is 
contraindicated, CT without contrast is preferred over MRI. The same method is preferred 
for all subsequent tumor assessments.
MedImmune Protocol D4190C00021
MEDI4736 24Jan2017; Amendment 6 Final
81 of 180 Template 16.2Tumor Evaluations
Physical examination
•Lesions detected by physical examination will only be considered measurable if 
superficial, eg, skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes. Documentation by color photography including ruler is recommended for estimating the size of skin lesions.
CT scan with contrast of the head and neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis
•CT scans should be performed with contiguous cuts in slice thickness of 5 mm or less. 
Spiral CT should be performed using a 5-mm contiguous reconstruction algorithm.
•Pelvis scan is optional unless known pelvic disease is preset at baseline.
MRI scans
•MRI of the head and neck, abdomen and pelvis (pelvic scan is optional unless known 
pelvic disease is present at baseline) is acceptable for measurement of lesions provided 
that the same anatomical plane is used for serial assessments. If possible, the same imaging device should be used for serial evaluations. In case of MRI, measurements will be preferably performed in the axial (transverse) plane on contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images. However, there are no specific sequence recommendations.
Measurability of Tumor Lesions 
Tumor lesions will be categorized as follows:
•Measurable Lesions - Must be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest 
diameter in the plane of measurement is to be recorded) with a minimum size of: 
◦10 mm by CT scan (irrespective of scanner type) and MRI (no less than double the 
slice thickness and a minimum of 10 mm)
◦10 mm caliper measurement by clinical exam (when superficial)
◦Malignant lymph nodes are considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, a 
lymph node must be ≥ 15 mm in short axis when assessed by CT scan (CT scan slice 
thickness recommended to be no greater than 5 mm)
•Nonmeasurable Lesions - Nonmeasurable lesions are defined as all other lesions 
(or sites of disease), including small lesions (longest diameter < 10 mm or pathological 
lymph nodes with ≥ 10 to < 15 mm in short axis). Lesions considered truly 
nonmeasurable include the following: leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial effusion, and inflammatory breast disease, lymphangitic involvement of skin or lung, abdominal masses/abdominal organomegaly identified by physical exam that is not measurable by reproducible imaging techniques.
MedImmune Protocol D4190C00021
MEDI4736 24Jan2017; Amendment 6 Final
82 of 180 Template 16.2•Target Lesions - All lesions up to a maximum of 5 lesions total (and a maximum of 
2 lesions per organ) representative of all involved organs should be identified as target 
lesions. It may be the case that, on occasion, the largest lesion does not lend itself to reproducible measurement in which circumstance the next largest lesion which can be measured reproducibly should be selected.
•Non-target Lesions - It is possible to record multiple non-target lesions involving the 
same organ as a single item on the electronic case report form (electronic case report 
form [eCRF]; eg, “multiple enlarged pelvic lymph nodes” or “multiple liver metastases”).
4.3.1.1 Evaluation of Response by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 
Tumor response will be assessed by RECIST v1.1.
Evaluation of Target Lesions
•CR - Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target 
or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to < 10 mm (the sum may not be “0” if 
there are target nodes). 
•PR - At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as 
reference the baseline sum diameters.
•PD - At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference 
the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). 
In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. (Note: The appearance of one or more new lesions may be considered progression.)
•SD - Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for 
PD, taking as reference the smallest sum of diameters while on study.
Evaluation of Non-target Lesions
•CR - Disappearance of all non-target lesions and normalization of tumor marker level. 
All lymph nodes must be non-pathological in size (< 10 mm in short axis). 
•Non-CR/Non-PD - Persistence of 1 or more non-target lesion(s) and/or maintenance of 
tumor marker level above the normal limits.
•PD - Unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions will be defined as the overall 
level of substantial worsening in non-target disease such that, even in presence of SD or 
PR in target disease, the overall tumor burden has increased sufficiently to merit discontinuation of therapy. In the absence of measurable disease, change in nonmeasurable disease comparable in magnitude to the increase that would be required to declare PD for measurable disease. Examples include an increase in a pleural effusion from “trace” to “large,” an increase in lymphangitic disease from localized to widespread.
MedImmune Protocol D4190C00021
MEDI4736 24Jan2017; Amendment 6 Final
83 of 180 Template 16.2Appearance of New Lesions
The appearance of new lesions is considered PD according to RECIST v1.1. Considering the 
unique response kinetics that have been observed with immunotherapy, new lesions may not 
represent true disease progression. In the absence of rapid clinical deterioration, subjects may continue to receive study treatment until confirmed PD (see Section 3.1.2.4 ).
Evaluation of Overall Response
Confirmation of CR, PR, as well as PD is required by a repeat, consecutive assessment no 
less than 4 weeks from the date of first documentation. If the next protocol scheduled scan is due within 2 weeks after the confirmatory scan was obtained, the protocol-scheduled scan does not need to be done. Treatment of subjects in Phase 1b and Phase 2 will continue 
between the initial assessment of PD and confirmation for PD (which is not required by 
RECIST v1.1; see Section 3.1.2.4 ). These subjects may continue to receive MEDI4736 in 
combination with tremelimumab beyond confirmed PD in accordance with Section 3.1.2 and 
if investigators consider that subjects continue to receive benefit from treatment. In the 
absence of clinical deterioration, such modifications to the RECIST criteria may discourage 
the early discontinuation of MEDI4736 in combination with tremelimumab and provide a more complete evaluation of MEDI4736 in combination with tremelimumab antitumor activity than would be seen with conventional response criteria.
Table 4.3.1.1-1 provides overall responses for all possible combinations of tumor responses 
in target and non-target lesions with or without the appearance of new lesions.

4.3.2 Tumor Biopsies
4.3.2.1 Fresh Tumor Biopsies (Phase 2 Only)
Fresh tumor biopsies should be preferentially obtained from tumor tissues that are safely 
accessible as determined by the investigator and are not obtained from sites that require 
significant risk procedures, which include, but are not limited to, biopsies of the brain, lung, 
mediastinum, pancreas, or endoscopic procedures extending beyond the esophagus, stomach 
or bowel wall [refer to the definition of a significant risk device under §812.3(m) in the 
Investigational Device Exemptions regulation (21 CFR 812)]. 
At baseline, fresh tumor biopsies will be obtained prior to administration of the first dose of 
investigational product(s) for all subjects. 
In addition, fresh tumor biopsies will be obtained on Week 5 Day 1 (± 7 days) and upon 
confirmed PD if clinically feasible (ie, repeat biopsy does not pose unacceptable medical risk to a subject as determined by the investigator). Additional biopsies may also be performed if 
clinically indicated (eg, for mixed responses). For subjects requiring serial image-guided core 
needle tumor biopsy, those biopsies will be performed according to institutional practice.
MedImmune Protocol D4190C00021
MEDI4736 24Jan2017; Amendment 6 Final
85 of 180 Template 16.2For fresh biopsies, the tumor lesion should not be used as a RECIST target lesion. Additional 
tumor biopsies are permitted as clinically indicated (eg, for mixed responses or upon 
confirmed PD). If clinically practical, at each fresh biopsy time point, subjects will undergo 
4 core biopsies, but a minimum of at least 3 core biopsies are required.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Tumor biopsies will be stored at MedImmune or an appropriate vendor selected by 
MedImmune.  
 
Additional details for sample collection, processing, storage, and shipment will be provided in the Laboratory Manual.
4.3.2.2 Archival Tumor Samples (Phase 1b and Phase 2)
Initial and subsequent archival tumor tissue should be provided. In Phase 2 Arm E, only 
archival tumor tissue will be accepted for biomarker pre-screening. Archival tumor samples 
must be  in paraffin blocks for IHC and additional correlative markers For Phase 1b and Arms A, B, C, and D in Phase 2, when an archival tumor block cannot be provided, only 
freshly cut sections should be provided as described in the Laboratory Manual.

4.3.4.1 Medical History and Physical Examination
Physical examinations will be performed according to institutional guidelines on study days 
noted in Section 4.2, and will include assessments of the head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat,

given a baseline grade according to the procedure for AEs. Increases in severity of 
pre-existing conditions during the study will be considered AEs, with resolution occurring 
when the grade returns to the prestudy grade or below.
4.3.4.2 Electrocardiograms
ECGs (12-lead) will be recorded on study days as noted in Section 4.2. At Week 1 Day 1, 
single ECGs will be obtained within 30 minutes prior to the start of infusion, within 30 minutes post-, and between 2 and 6 hours post-end of infusion of tremelimumab and/or MEDI4736. All other ECGs will be performed once per visit, (prior to investigational 
product(s) administration if during the treatment period) and as clinically indicated. In case 
of clinically significant ECG abnormalities, including an ECG that demonstrates a QT corrected using Fridericia’s formula (QTcF) value > 500 milliseconds, 2 additional 12-lead ECGs should be obtained over a brief period (eg, 30 minutes) to confirm prolongation.
The same recorder will be used for each subject at each time point, if possible. Date and time 
settings should be checked at the start of each study day and aligned with an official timekeeper for all machines used in the study.
Skin preparations should be thorough and electrode positions should be according to standard 
12-lead ECG placement.
In this study lead V2 will be analyzed and reported as primary. Lead V5 will be analyzed, for 
all visits, as backup for the individual where analysis in lead V2 is not deemed possible for 
pre-dose or significant parts of whole visits or whole visits.
The following variables will be reported: heart rate, PR, RR, QRS and QT intervals from the 
primary lead of the digital 12-lead ECG.
4.3.4.3 Vital Signs
Vital signs (temperature, blood pressure [BP], pulse rate [or pulse oximetry at screening], and respiratory rate) will be measured on study days noted in Section 4.2.

MEDI4736 24Jan2017; Amendment 6 Final
92 of 180 Template 16.2than approximately 29 mL of blood will be drawn for any one protocol visit during treatment. 
During the follow-up period, no more than approximately 29 mL of blood will be collected at 
any one follow-up visit. The total volume to be collected will depend on the length of a 
subject’s participation in the study as well as to which phase of the study they are enrolled (eg, Phase 1b vs Phase 2).
4.4 Study Suspension or Termination
The sponsor reserves the right to temporarily suspend or terminate this study at any time. The reasons for temporarily suspending or terminating the study may include but are not limited to the following: 
1. The incidence or severity of AEs in this or other studies indicates a potential health 
hazard to subjects
2. Subject enrollment is unsatisfactory3. Noncompliance that might significantly jeopardize the validity or integrity of the study4. Enrollment into Phase 2 may be discontinued at the discretion of the sponsor should 
emerging clinical or nonclinical data suggest that continued treatment may not be beneficial to a given treatment
If MedImmune determines that temporary suspension or termination of the study is required, 
MedImmune will discuss the reasons for taking such action with all participating investigators (or head of the medical institution, where applicable). When feasible, MedImmune will provide advance notice to all participating investigators (or head of the 
medical institution, where applicable) of the impending action.
If the study is suspended or terminated for safety reasons, MedImmune will promptly inform 
all investigators, heads of the medical institutions (where applicable), and/or institutions conducting the study. MedImmune will also promptly inform the relevant regulatory 
authorities of the suspension/termination along with the reasons for such action. Where 
required by applicable regulations, the investigator or head of the medical institution must inform the Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) promptly and provide the reason(s) for the suspension/termination. If the study is suspended for safety 
reasons and it is deemed appropriate by the sponsor to resume the study, approval from the 
relevant regulatory authorities (and IRBs/IECs when applicable) will be obtained prior to resuming the study.

4.5.1.5 Monitoring of Dose Administration
Subjects will be monitored prior to, during, and after infusion of MEDI4736 and 
tremelimumab. Vital signs (temperature, BP, pulse rate, and respiratory rate) will be measured on MEDI4736/tremelimumab treatment days within 30 minutes prior to the start of 
MEDI4736 and/or tremelimumab administration, every 15 minutes (± 5 minutes) during 
MEDI4736 and/or tremelimumab administration, at the end of MEDI4736 and/ortremelimumab infusion (± 5 minutes), and at 30 and 60 minutes (± 5 minutes) post end of infusion of MEDI4736. For subjects receiving combination therapy, vital signs will be 
measured within 30 minutes prior to start of tremelimumab and MEDI4736 infusion, every 
15 minutes (± 5 minutes) during tremelimumab and MEDI4736 infusion, at EOI of tremelimumab and MEDI4736 (± 5 minutes), and at 30 and 60 minutes (± 5 minutes) post EOI of MEDI4736 infusion. Pulse oximetry is a required vital sign at screening for baseline 
comparison. Pulse oximetry is optional on future visits, and should be obtained per clinical 
investigator if there is clinical concern for respiratory evaluation, including but not limited to immune-related pneumonitis or interstitial lung disease (ILD), as detailed in Appendix 5 . For 
Dose 1, an additional 2-hour (± 15 minutes) observation period will be required after the 60 
MedImmune Protocol D4190C00021
MEDI4736 24Jan2017; Amendment 6 Final
98 of 180 Template 16.2minutes (± 5 minutes) post end of infusion of MEDI4736 vital sign assessment. The 
additional 2-hour observation period will not be required for subsequent doses unless
clinically indicated (eg, the subject experiences an infusion reaction).
In the event of ≤ Grade 2 infusion-related reaction, the infusion rate of MEDI4736 and 
tremelimumab may be decreased by 50% or temporarily interrupted until resolution of the event (up to 4 hours) and re-initiated at 50% of the initial rate until completion of the 
infusion. In subjects experiencing ≤ Grade 2 infusion-related reaction, subsequent infusions 
may be administered at 50% of the initial rate.
Primary prophylaxis against infusion-related reacti ons is not permitted during this study in 
order to avoid obscuring a potential safety signal and to enable a future assessment regarding 
whether premedications should be required for all subjects in future studies. However, at the 
discretion of the investigator, secondary prophylaxis (ie, prevention of infusion-related reaction following initial episode) is appropriate and will be permitted. Acetaminophen and/or an antihistamine (eg, diphenhydramine) or equivalent medications per institutional 
standard may be administered per institutional standard at the discretion of the investigator. If 
the infusion-related reaction is Grade 3 or higher in severity, treatment with MEDI4736 and tremelimumab will be discontinued.
As with any mAb, allergic reactions to dose administration are possible. Therefore, 
appropriate drugs and medical equipment to treat acute anaphylactic reactions must be 
immediately available, and study personnel must be trained to recognize and treat anaphylaxis.
All dosing visits are scheduled based on the date of Week 1 Day 1 dosing. Future dosing 
visits should not be recalibrated based on actual dosing dates unless approved by the sponsor.
 
 
 
 
 the subject experiences a related toxicity, the management guidelines 
provided in Section 3.1.5 should be followed.

4.6.1 Methods for Assigning Treatment Groups
In Phase 2, subjects will be enrolled in 1 of 5 treatment arms. Second-line subjects with 
metastatic or recurrent gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma will be randomized in a 2:2:1 ratio to 
Arm A (MEDI4736 in combination with tremelimumab), Arm B (M EDI4736 monot herapy), 
or Arm C (tremelimumab monotherapy). In parallel, third-line subjects with metastatic or recurrent gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma will be enrolled in Arm D (MEDI4736 in 
combination with tremelimumab). Upon closure of Arms A, B, and C and completion of 
Arm D, second- and third-line subjects with metastatic or recurrent gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma and a positive IFN- γ gene expression signature will be enrolled in Arm E
(MEDI4736 in combination with tremelimumab).  
 
The randomization code will be produced by an independent statistician, who is not part of 
the study team. Randomization/enrollment to treatment groups will be performed using 
IXRS. 
The time between randomization/enrollment and the initiation of treatment should be as short 
as possible and no more than 1 business day. If there is a delay in the administration of 
investigational product such that it will not be administered within the specified timeframe, 
the study monitor must be notified immediately .

105 of 180 Template 16.2•OR is defined as best overall response of confirmed CR or confirmed PR according to 
RECIST v1.1. The best overall response is defined as the best response (in the order of 
CR, PR, SD, PD, and not evaluable) among all overall responses recorded from the start of treatment/until progression, or the last evaluable disease assessment in the absence of PD prior to the initiation of subsequent anticancer therapy or discontinuation from the study, whichever occurs first. The best overall response of CR or PR must be confirmed, which means a response of CR/PR is recorded at 1 visit and confirmed by repeat imaging not less than 28 days (4 weeks) after the visit when the response was first observed with no evidence of progression between the initial and CR/PR confirmation visit.
•DoR is defined as the duration from the first documentation of OR to the first 
documented disease progression according to RECIST v1.1 or death due to any cause, 
whichever occurs first. For subjects who are alive and progression-free at the time of DCO for analysis, DoR will be censored at the last tumor assessment date. The DoR will be evaluated only for the subjects with an OR.
•DC is defined as confirmed CR, confirmed PR, or SD based on RECIST v1.1. DC at 
16 and 24 weeks is defined as a best overall response of confirmed CR, confirmed PR or 
having SD with duration of SD lasting 16 and 24 weeks, respectively.
•PFS will be measured from the date of randomization or start of treatment until the 
documentation of disease progression according to RECIST v1.1 or death due to any 
cause, whichever occurs first. For subjects who are alive and progression-free at the time of DCO for analysis, PFS will be censored at the last tumor assessment date. PFS-6 and 
 are the proportion of subjects with PFS at 6 months , respectively.
•OS will be measured as the time from date of randomization or the start of treatment until 
death due to any cause. For subjects who are alive at the time of DCO, OS will be 
censored on the last date when subjects are known to be alive.
4.8.3.1 Primary Efficacy Analysis
Phase 2 
•The 2 co-primary efficacy endpoints for Phas e 2 are OR and PFS-6 based on RECIST 
v1.1. The primary analysis of primary efficacy endpoints will be performed as follows.
•The ORR is defined as the proportion of subjects with OR. The 2 sided 90 and 95% CIs 
for ORR will be estimated using the exact binomial distribution. In addition, to help make 
a comparison to historical data, the unconfirmed ORR which is defined as the proportion of subjects who achieved a best overall response of confirmed/unconfirmed CR or confirmed/unconfirmed PR will be presented along with its CIs.
•The PFS-6 is the proportion of subjects with PFS at 6 months. Kaplan-Meier curves will 
be generated for PFS and used to estimate the PFS-6 along with its 2-sided 90% and 95% 
CIs. The CIs for PFS-6 will be calculated by applying asymptotic normality to the log-log transformation of PFS-6.

CIs of ORR will be provided based on an exact probability method.
•The DCR is defined as the proportion of subjects with DC. The 2-sided 90% and 95% CIs of DCR will be provided using an exact probability method. DCR-16w and 
DCR-24w (defined as the proportion of subjects with DC at 16 and 24 weeks, respectively) will be estimated along with their 2-sided 90% and 95% CIs. 
Phase 2 
Secondary efficacy endpoints for Phase 2 include DoR, DC, PFS, and OS. The analyses of all 
secondary endpoints will be performed as follows:
•The DoR according to RECIST v1.1 will be analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method for 
those subjects with OR in the corresponding analysis populations. The median of DoR 
with 90% and 95% CIs will be estimated based on the Kaplan-Meier curves. 
•The DCR according to RECIST v1.1 is defined as the proportion of subjects with DC.
The 2-sided 90% and 95% CIs of DCR will be provided using an exact probability 
method. DCR at 16 and at 24 weeks (defined as the proportion of subjects with DC at 16 and 24 weeks, respectively) will be estimated along with their 2-sided 90% and 95% CIs. 
•The PFS according to RECIST v1.1 will be analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method. 
The median PFS with 90% and 95% CIs will be estimated based on the Kaplan-Meier 
curves. The landmark 9-months PFS rate will be estimated based on the Kaplan-Meier curves along with their 2-sided 90% and 95% CIs.
•The OS will be analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method. The median OS with 90% and 
95% CIs will be estimated based on the Kaplan-Meier curves. The 1-year OS rate will be 
estimated based on the Kaplan-Meier curves along with their 2-sided 90% and 95% CIs.
Only subjects whose archival tumor tissue sample showed a positive IFN- γ gene expression 
signature will be eligible for enrollment to Arm E. This will allow identification of a unique population of gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma subjects who may benefit from treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors and will allow correlations between IFN- γ gene expression 
and clinical activity of MEDI4736 in combination with tremelimumab to be explored.

108 of 180 Template 16.24.8.4.1 Analysis of Adverse Events
In Phase 1b, the number of DLTs that are identified in the DLT Evaluable Population during 
the DLT evaluation period will be summarized or listed. For both Phase 1b and Phase 2, the number and percentage of subjects reporting treatment-emergent AEs will be summarized overall and by the worst NCI CTCAE v4.03 grade, system organ class, and preferred term, 
with a breakdown by treatment arm. Similarly, the number and percentage of subjects 
reporting treatment-emergent AEs considered related to investigational product will be summarized. At each level of subject summarization, a subject will be counted once using the highest grade and level of causality if one or more occurrences of the same system organ 
class/preferred term is reported. AEs will be graded according to the NCI CTCAE v4.03 and 
coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities. 
4.8.4.2 Analysis of Clinical Laboratory Parameters
Descriptive statistics will be provided for the clinical laboratory results and changes from baseline by scheduled time of evaluation and by treatment arm including end of treatment visit as well as for the maximum and minimum post-baseline values. Laboratory 
abnormalities will be graded according to the NCI CTCAE v4.03, if applicable. Frequencies 
of worst observed grade will be presented for each laboratory parameter as well as the rates of subjects with Grade 3-4 toxicities. A shift table, presenting the 2-way frequency tabulation for baseline and the worst post-baseline grade, will be provided for clinical laboratory tests.
4.8.4.3 Analysis of Vital Signs
Descriptive statistics will be provided for the vital signs measurements and changes from baseline by scheduled time of evaluation and by treatment arm including end of treatment 
visit as well as for the maximum and minimum post-baseline values.
4.8.4.4 Analysis of Electrocardiograms
ECG parameters (PR, RR, QRS, QT, QTcF) will be summarized using descriptive statistics 
for actual values and for changes from baseline by treatment arm by scheduled time of evaluation including end of treatment visit as well as for the maximum post-baseline values. The QTcF will be considered as the primary correction method to assess subject cardiac 
safety.
The notable ECG interval values in maximum absolute QTcF intervals 
(new !450 milliseconds, new > 480 milliseconds, new > 500 milliseconds) and the 
maximum absolute uncorrected QT intervals (new !500 milliseconds) over all post-baseline 
evaluations, as well as in QTcF maximum changes from baseline ( !30 and 
MedImmune Protocol D4190C00021

5 ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY
5.1 Definition of Adverse Events
The International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) Guideline for Good Clinical Practice 
(GCP) E6(R1) defines an AE as:
Any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject 
administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal 
relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended 
sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally 
associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the 
medicinal product.
An AE includes but is not limited to any clinically significant worsening of a subject’s 
pre-existing condition. The term disease progression should not be reported as an AE or 
SAE, however, individual events and/or laboratory abnormalities associated with disease progression (see definition of disease progression below) that fulfill the AE or SAE definition should be reported. An abnormal laboratory finding (including ECG finding) that 
requires medical intervention by the investigator, or a finding judged by the investigator as 
medically significant should be reported as an AE. If clinical sequelae are associated with a laboratory abnormality, the diagnosis or medical condition should be reported (eg, renal failure, hematuria) not the laboratory abnormality (eg, elevated creatinine, urine red blood 
cell increased). 
AEs may be treatment emergent (ie, occurring after initial receipt of investigational product) 
or nontreatment emergent. A nontreatment-emergent AE is any new sign or symptom, 
MedImmune Protocol D4190C00021
MEDI4736 24Jan2017; Amendment 6 Final
112 of 180 Template 16.2disease, or other untoward medical event that begins after written informed consent has been 
obtained but before the subject has received investigational product. 
Elective treatment or surgery or preplanned treatment or surgery (that was scheduled prior to 
the subject being enrolled into the study) for a documented pre-existing condition that did not 
worsen from baseline is not considered an AE (serious or nonserious). An untoward medical 
event occurring during the prescheduled elective procedure or routinely scheduled treatment 
should be recorded as an AE or SAE.
Adverse Events Associated with Disease Progression
Disease progression can be considered as a worsening of a subject’s condition attributable to 
the disease for which the investigational product is being studied. It may be an increase in the 
severity of the disease under study and/or increases in the symptoms of the disease. The 
development of a new metastasis or progression of existing metastasis related to the primary cancer under study should not be considered an AE. 
New Cancers
The development of a new cancer should be regarded as an SAE. New cancers are those that 
are not the primary reason for the administration of the investigational product and have been identified after the subject’s inclusion in the study.
5.2 Definition of Serious Adverse Events
An SAE is any AE that:
•Results in death
•Is immediately life-threatening
•Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization 
•Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity 
•Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect in offspring of the subject
•Is an important medical event that may jeopardize the subject or may require medical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above
Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting 
is appropriate in this situation. Examples of medically important events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias, or 
MedImmune Protocol D4190C00021
MEDI4736 24Jan2017; Amendment 6 Final
113 of 180 Template 16.2convulsions that do not result in hospitalizations; or development of drug dependency or drug 
abuse.
5.3 Definition of Adverse Events of Special Interest
An AESI is one of scientific and medical interest specific to understanding of the investigational product and may require close monitoring and rapid communication by the investigator to the sponsor. An AESI may be serious or non-serious. The rapid reporting of 
AESIs allows ongoing surveillance of these events in order to characterize and understand 
them in association with the use of this investigational product.
AESIs for MEDI4736 include but are not limited to events with a potential inflammatory or 
immune-mediated mechanism and which may require more frequent monitoring and/or 
interventions such as steroids, immunosuppressants and/or hormone replacement therapy.These AESIs are being closely monitored in clinical studies with MEDI4736 monotherapy and combination therapy. An irAE is defined as anAE that is associated with drug exposure 
and is consistent with an immune-mediated mechanism of action and where there is no clear 
alternate etiology. Serologic, immunologic, and histologic (biopsy) data, as appropriate,should be used to support an irAE diagnosis. Appropriate efforts should be made to rule outneoplastic, infectious, metabolic, toxin, or other etiologic causes of the irAE. If the 
investigator has any questions in regards to an AE being an irAE, the Investigator should 
promptly contact the Study Physician.
AESIs observed with MEDI4736 include:
∀Diarrhea / colitis
•Pneumonitis / ILD
•ALT / AST increases / hepatitis / hepatotoxicity
•Neuropathy / neuromuscular toxicity (eg, Guillain-Barré, and myasthenia gravis) 
•Endocrinopathies (ie, events of hypophysitis , hypopituitarism adrenal insufficiency, 
diabetes insipidus, hyper- and hypothyroidism and Type I diabetes mellitus)
•Rash / dermatitis
•Nephritis / blood creatinine increases
•Pancreatitis (or labs suggestive of pancreatitis - increased serum lipase , increased serum 
amylase) 
•Other inflammatory responses that are rare with a potential immune-mediated aetiology 
include, but are not limited to, myocarditis, pericarditis, and uveitis 
MedImmune Protocol D4190C00021
MEDI4736 24Jan2017; Amendment 6 Final
114 of 180 Template 16.2•In addition, infusion-related reactions and hypersensitivity/anaphylactic reactions with a 
different underlying pharmacological aetiology are also considered AESIs. 
Further information on these risks (eg, presenting symptoms) can be found in the current 
version of the MEDI4736 Investigator’s Brochure. More specific guidelines for their evaluation and treatment are described in detail in guidelines for their evaluation and 
treatment are described in detail in the Dosing Modification and Toxicity Management 
Guidelines (see Appendix 5 ). These guidelines have been prepared by the Sponsor to assist 
the Investigator in the exercise of his/her clinical judgment in treating these types of toxicities. These guidelines apply to AEs considered causally related to the study drug/study 
regimen by the reporting investigator.
Hypersensitivity Reactions
Hypersensitivity reactions as well as infusion-related reactions have been reported with 
anti-PD-L1 and anti-PD-1 therapy ( Brahmer et al, 2012 ). As with the administration of any 
foreign protein and/or other biologic agents, reactions following the infusion of mAbs can be 
caused by various mechanisms, including acute anaphylactic (IgE-mediated) and anaphylactoid reactions against the mAb, and serum sickness. Acute allergic reactions may 
occur, may be severe, and may result in death. Acute allergic reactions may include 
hypotension, dyspnea, cyanosis, respiratory failure, urticaria, pruritus, angioedema, hypotonia, arthralgia, bronchospasm, wheeze, cough, dizziness, fatigue, headache, hypertension, myalgia, vomiting, and unresponsiveness.
5.4 Recording of Adverse Events
AEs will be recorded on the eCRF using a recognized medical term or diagnosis that accurately reflects the event. AEs will be assessed by the investigator for severity, 
relationship to the investigational product, possible etiologies, and whether the event meets 
criteria of an SAE and therefore requires immediate notification to MedImmune Patient Safety. See Section 5.2for the definition of SAEs and Appendix 7 for guidelines for 
assessment of severity and relationship. If an AE evolves into a condition that meets the 
regulatory definition of “serious,” it will be reported on the SAE Report Form.
Infusion of biological products is commonly associated with infusion-related reactions. 
Anaphylaxis and infusion-related reactions have some common manifestations and may be 
difficult to distinguish from each other. Infusion-related reactions are commonly observed 
during or shortly after the first time exposure to therapeutic mAbs delivered through IV 
infusion. These reactions are less common following subsequent exposures. Unlike infusion-
MedImmune Protocol D4190C00021
MEDI4736 24Jan2017; Amendment 6 Final
115 of 180 Template 16.2related reactions, anaphylaxis is a rare event, usually occurring after subsequent exposure to 
an antigen, and it is most commonly accompanied by severe systemic skin and/or mucosal 
reactions. The investigator is advised to carefully examine symptoms of adverse reactions 
observed during or shortly after exposure to MEDI4736 and tremelimumab, and consider the 
above mentioned facts prior to making a final diagnosis. Reactions occurring at the time of or 
shortly after subsequent infusions of investigational product are to be judged by the 
investigator at his/her own discretion. For the investigator’s convenience and in order to 
facilitate consistency in judgments a copy of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious 
Diseases (NIAID) and Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis Network (FAAN) guidance for 
anaphylaxis diagnosis is provided in Appendix 8 .
5.4.1 Time Period for Collection of Adverse Events
AEs will be collected from time of signature of informed consent, enrollment, randomization, 
throughout the treatment period and including the follow-up period of 90 days after the last dose of MEDI4736 and tremelimumab.
SAEs will be recorded from the time of informed consent signature through 90 days after the 
last dose of MEDI4736 and tremelimumab.
5.4.2 Follow-up of Unresolved Adverse Events
Any AEs that are unresolved at the subject’s last AE assessment or other assessment/visit as 
appropriate in the study are followed up by the investigator for as long as medically indicated, but without further recording in the eCRF. MedImmune retains the right to request 
additional information for any subject with ongoing AE(s)/SAE(s) at the end of the study, if 
judged necessary. After 90 days, only subjects with investigational product-related SAEs will continue to be followed for safety.
5.4.3 Deaths ……….
All deaths that occur during the study, including the protocol-defined follow-up period must 
be reported as follows:
•Death clearly the result of disease progression should be reported at the next visit 
and documented in the eCRF but should not be reported as an SAE.
MedImmune Protocol D4190C00021
MEDI4736 24Jan2017; Amendment 6 Final
116 of 180 Template 16.2•Where death is not due (or not clearly due) to disease progression, the AE causing the 
death must be reported as an SAE within 24 hours. The report should contain a comment 
regarding the co-involvement of disease progression, if appropriate, and should assign main and contributory causes of death.
•Deaths with an unknown cause should always be reported as an SAE. A post-mortem 
may be helpful in the assessment of the cause of death, and if performed a copy of the 
post-mortem results should be forwarded to MedImmune Patient Safety or designee within the usual timeframes.
5.5 Reporting of Serious Adverse Events
Within 24 hours of identifying an SAE, regardless of the presumed relationship to the 
investigational product, the investigator or qualified designee must complete the SAE 
Report Form and fax it to MedImmune Patient Safety.
MedImmune contact information: 
 
The sponsor is responsible for reporting certain SAEs as expedited safety reports to 
applicable regulatory authorities, ethics committees, and participating investigators, in 
accordance with ICH guidelines and/or local regulatory requirements. The sponsor may be 
required to report certain SAEs to regulatory authorities within 7 calendar days of being 
notified about the event; therefore, it is important that investigators submit additional 
information requested by the sponsor as soon as it becomes available.
Investigators should provide all available information at the time of SAE Report Form 
completion. Investigators should not wait to collect additional information to fully document 
the event before notifying MedImmune Patient Safety of an SAE. When additional 
information becomes available, investigators should submit a follow-up SAE Report Form 
(separate from the initial report form) with the new information. Any follow-up information 
to an SAE also needs to be provided to MedImmune Patient Safety within 24 hours of 
learning of the new information. 
MedImmune Protocol D4190C00021
MEDI4736 24Jan2017; Amendment 6 Final
117 of 180 Template 16.25.6 Other Events Requiring Immediate Reporting
5.6.1 Overdose ……….
An overdose is defined as a subject receiving a dose of investigational product in excess of 
that specified in the Investigator’s Brochures, unless otherwise specified in this protocol.
Any overdose of a study subject with the investigational product, with or without associated 
AEs/SAEs, is required to be reported within 24 hours of knowledge of the event to 
MedImmune Patient Safety using the Safety Fax Notification Form (see Section 5.5for 
contact information). If the overdose results in an AE, the AE must also be recorded on the 
AE eCRF (see Section 5.4). Overdose does not automatically make an AE serious, but if the 
consequences of the overdose are serious, for example death or hospitalization, the event is 
serious and must be reported as an SAE (see Section 5.4and Section 5.5). MedImmune does 
not recommend specific treatment for an overdose. The investigator will use clinical
judgment to treat any overdose.
5.6.2 Hepatic Function Abnormality
Hepatic function abnormality meeting the definition of Hy’s law (ie, any increase in ALT or 
AST to greater than 3 × ULN and concurrent increase in total bilirubin to be greater than 
2 × ULN) is considered an AESI. Concurrent findings are those that derive from a single 
blood draw or from separate blood draws taken within 8 days of each other. Follow-up 
investigations and inquiries will be initiated promptly by the investigational site to determine 
whether the findings are reproducible and/or whether there is objective evidence that clearly 
supports causation by a disease (eg, cholelithiasis and bile duct obstruction with distended 
gallbladder) or an agent other than the investigational product. Guidelines for management of 
subjects with hepatic function abnormality are outlined in Section 3.1.5 .
Hepatic function abnormality in a study subject, with or without associated clinical 
manifestations, is required to be reported as “hepatic function abnormal” within 24 hours of 
knowledge of the event to MedImmune Patient Safety using the Safety Fax Notification Form 
(see Section 5.5for contact information), unless a definitive underlying diagnosis for the 
abnormality (eg, cholelithiasis or bile duct obstruction) that is unrelated to investigational 
product has been confirmed.
If the definitive underlying diagnosis for the abnormality has been established and is 
unrelated to investigational product, the decision to continue dosing of the study subject will 
be based on the clinical judgment of the investigator.
MedImmune Protocol D4190C00021
MEDI4736 24Jan2017; Amendment 6 Final
118 of 180 Template 16.2If no definitive underlying diagnosis for the abnormality is established, dosing of the study 
subject must be interrupted immediately. Follow-up investigations and inquiries must be 
initiated by the investigational site without delay.
Each reported event of hepatic function abnormality will be followed by the investigator and 
evaluated by the sponsor. If the etiology of the event remains unconfirmed and/or is considered related to investigational product (see Appendix 7 ), a prompt cumulative review 
of safety data and the circumstances of the event in question will be conducted and assessed 
by the MedImmune Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC; or equivalent) to determine whether continued dosing of current study subjects and/or study entry should be interrupted, whether the protocol will be modified, or whether the study will be discontinued 
permanently. Review and approval by the SMC (or equivalent) is required for resumption of 
subject dosing or study entry in the event that the study is interrupted. Where applicable, regulatory authorities IRBs/IECs will be notified of any actions taken with the study.
5.6.3 Pregnancy ……….
Pregnancy in a female subject who has received investigational product is required to be 
reported within 24 hours of knowledge of the event to MedImmune Patient Safety using the 
Safety Fax Notification Form (see Section 5.5for contact information).
Subjects who become pregnant during the study period must not receive additional doses of 
investigational product but will not be withdrawn from the study. The pregnancy will be 
followed for outcome of the mother and child (including any premature terminations) and 
should be reported to MedImmune Patient Safety after outcome.
Should the investigator become aware of a pregnancy in the partner of a male study subject 
who has received investigational product this should be reported within 24 hours of 
knowledge of the event to MedImmune Patient Safety using the Safety Fax Notification 
Form (see Section 5.5for contact information). The sponsor will endeavor to collect follow-
up information on such pregnancies provided the partner of the study subject provides 
consent.

119 of 180 Template 16.26 STUDY AND DATA MANAGEMENT
6.1 Training of Study Site Personnel
Before the first subject is entered into the study, a MedImmune representative will review 
and discuss the requirements of the Clinical Study Protocol and related documents with the 
investigational staff and also train them in any study-specific procedures and system(s) utilized.
The principal investigator will ensure that appropriate training relevant to the study is given 
to all of these staff, and that any new information relevant to the performance of this study is
forwarded to the staff involved.
The principal investigator will maintain a record of all individuals involved in the study 
(medical, nursing and other staff).
6.2 Monitoring of the Study
During the study, a MedImmune representative will have regular contacts with the study site, including visits to:
•Provide information and support to the investigator(s).
•Confirm that facilities remain acceptable.
•Confirm that the investigational team is adhering to the protocol, that data are being 
accurately and timely recorded in the eCRFs, that biological samples are handled in 
accordance with the Laboratory Manual and that study drug accountability checks are being performed.
•Perform source data verification (a comparison of the data in the eCRFs with the 
subject’s medical records at the hospital or practice, and other records relevant to the 
study) including verification of informed consent of participating subjects. This will require direct access to all original records for each subject (eg, clinic charts).
•Ensure withdrawal of informed consent to the use of the subject’s biological samples is 
reported and biological samples are identified and disposed of/destroyed accordingly, and 
the action is documented, and reported to the subject.
The MedImmune representative will be available between visits if the investigator(s) or other 
staff at the center needs information and advice about the study conduct.
6.2.1 Source Data
Refer to the Clinical Study Agreement for location of source data.
MedImmune Protocol D4190C00021
MEDI4736 24Jan2017; Amendment 6 Final
120 of 180 Template 16.26.2.2 Study Agreements
The principal investigator at each/the center should comply with all the terms, conditions, 
and obligations of the Clinical Study Agreement, or equivalent, for this study. In the event of 
any inconsistency between this Clinical Study Protocol and the Clinical Study Agreement, 
the terms of Clinical Study Protocol shall prevail with respect to the conduct of the study and the treatment of subjects and in all other respects, not relating to study conduct or treatment of subjects, the terms of the Clinical Study Agreement shall prevail.
Agreements between MedImmune and the principal investigator must be in place before any 
study-related procedures can take place, or subjects are enrolled.
6.2.3 Archiving of Study Documents
The investigator follows the principles outlined in the Clinical Study Agreement.
6.3 Study Timetable and End of Study
An individual subject will be considered to have completed the study if the subject was 
followed through the end of the study (defined below), regardless of the number of doses of investigational product that was received. 
The end of the study (“study completion”) is 5 years after the final subject is enrolled or the 
date the study is closed by the sponsor, whichever occurs first.
6.4 Data Management
Data management will be performed according to the Data Management Plan .
A Web Based Data Capture system will be used for data collection and query handling. The 
investigator will ensure that data are recorded on the eCRFs as specified in the study protocol and in accordance with the instructions provided.
The investigator ensures the accuracy, completeness, and timeliness of the data recorded and 
of the provision of answers to data queries according to the Clinical Study Agreement. The investigator will sign the completed eCRFs. A copy of the completed eCRFs will be archived at the study site.
6.5 Medical Monitor Coverage
Each subject will be provided with contact information for the principal investigator. In addition, each subject will receive a toll-free number intended to provide the subject’s 
MedImmune Protocol D4190C00021
MEDI4736 24Jan2017; Amendment 6 Final
121 of 180 Template 16.2physician access to a medical monitor 24 hours a day, 7 days a week in the event of an 
emergent situation where the subject’s health is deemed to be at risk. In this situation, when a 
subject presents to a medical facility where the treating physician or health care provider 
requires access to a physician who has knowledge of the investigational product and the clinical study protocol and the principal investigator is not available, the treating physician or health care provider can contact a medical monitor through this system, which is managed by 
a third party vendor.
7 ETHICAL AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS
7.1 Ethical Conduct of the Study
The study will be performed in accordance with ethical principles that have their origin in the 
Declaration of Helsinki and are consistent with ICH/GCP, and applicable regulatory 
requirements.
7.2 Subject Data Protection
The informed consent form (ICF) will incorporate (or, in some cases, be accompanied by a separate document incorporating) wording that complies with relevant data protection and 
privacy legislation.
MedImmune will not provide individual genotype results to subjects, any insurance 
company, any employer, their family members, general physician or any other third party, 
unless required to do so by law .
Extra precautions are taken to preserve confidentiality and prevent genetic data being linked 
to the identity of the subject. In exceptional circumstances, however, certain individuals might see both the genetic data and the personal identifiers of a subject. For example, in the 
case of a medical emergency, a MedImmune medical monitor or an investigator might know 
a subject’s identity and also have access to his or her genetic data. Also regulatory authorities may require access to the relevant files, though the subject’s medical information and the genetic files would remain physically separate.
7.3 Ethics and Regulatory Review
An IRB/IEC should approve the final study protocol, including the final version of the ICFand any other written information and/or materials to be provided to the subjects. The 
investigator will ensure the distribution of these documents to the applicable IRB/IEC, and to 
the study site staff.
MedImmune Protocol D4190C00021
MEDI4736 24Jan2017; Amendment 6 Final
122 of 180 Template 16.2The opinion of the IRB/IEC should be given in writing. The investigator should submit the 
written approval to MedImmune before enrollment of any subject into the study. 
The IRB/IEC should approve all advertising used to recruit subjects for the study.
MedImmune should approve any modifications to the ICF that are needed to meet local 
requirements.
If required by local regulations, the protocol should be re-approved by the IRB/IEC annually.
Before enrollment of any subject into the study, the final study protocol, including the final 
version of the ICF, is approved by the national regulatory authority or a notification to the national regulatory authority is done, according to local regulations.
MedImmune will handle the distribution of any of these documents to the national regulatory 
authorities.
MedImmune will provide regulatory authorities, IRB/IEC, and principal investigators with 
safety updates/reports according to local requirements, including suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions, where relevant.
Each principal investigator is responsible for providing the IRB/IEC with reports of any 
serious and unexpected adverse drug reactions from any other study conducted with the investigational product. MedImmune will provide this information to the principal investigator so that he/she can meet these reporting requirements.
7.4 Informed Consent
The principal investigator(s) at each center will:
•Ensure each subject is given full and adequate oral and written information about the 
nature, purpose, possible risk and benefit of the study
•Ensure each subject is notified that they are free to discontinue from the study at any time
•Ensure that each subject is given the opportunity to ask questions and allowed time to consider the information provided
•Ensure each subject provides signed and dated informed consent before conducting any procedure specifically for the study
•Ensure the original, signed ICF(s) is/are stored in the investigator’s Study File
•Ensure a copy of the signed ICF is given to the subject
MedImmune Protocol D4190C00021
MEDI4736 24Jan2017; Amendment 6 Final
123 of 180 Template 16.2•Ensure that any incentives for subjects who participate in the study as well as any 
provisions for subjects harmed as a consequence of study participation are described in 
the ICF that is approved by an IRB/IEC
7.5 Changes to the Protocol and Informed Consent Form
Study procedures will not be changed without the mutual agreement of the coordinating 
investigator and MedImmune.
If there are any substantial changes to the study protocol, then these changes will be 
documented in a study protocol amendment and where required in a new version of the study protocol.
The amendment is to be approved by the relevant IRB/IEC and if applicable, also the 
national regulatory authority approval, before implementation. Local requirements are to be followed for revised protocols.
MedImmune will distribute any subsequent amendments and new versions of the protocol to 
each principal investigator(s). For distribution to IRB/IEC, see Section 7.3.
If a protocol amendment requires a change to a site’s ICF, MedImmune and the site’s 
IRB/IEC are to approve the revised ICF before the revised form is used. 
If local regulations require, any administrative change will be communicated to or approved 
by each IRB/IEC.
7.6 Audits and Inspections
Authorized representatives of MedImmune, a regulatory authority, or an IRB/IEC may perform audits or inspections at the center, including source data verification. The purpose of 
an audit or inspection is to systematically and independently examine all study-related activities and documents, to determine whether these activities were conducted, and data were recorded, analyzed, and accurately reported according to the protocol, GCP, guidelines 
of the ICH, and any applicable regulatory requirements. The investigator will contact 
MedImmune immediately if contacted by a regulatory agency about an inspection at the site.

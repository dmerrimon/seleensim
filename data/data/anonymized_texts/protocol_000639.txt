Study 
Treatment :               12 Week s Clinical Phase: Phase 2b  
Objectives:  
The objective of this study is: 
To evaluate the dose response relationship of the efficacy and safety  of two strengths, of topical 
DFD -07 (celecoxib ) Cream, 1.25 % and 2.5% when used once or twice daily compared to 
Vehicle in the treatment of AK of the face  and/or scalp  over a  12-week  period  with a 4-week 
follow up .   
Methods:   
This is a multi -center, randomized, double -blind , parallel group,  Vehicle -controlled study.  The 
study products w ill be applied to the target lesions once or twice daily for a duration of 12 
weeks of treatment , with a 4 -week treatment -free follow -up. Subjects , who are at least 18 years 
old, diagnosed with AK of the face  and/or scalp  will be  randomized to treatment in one of the 
following four arms (60 subjects  in each group):

 applied only in the evening, while the Vehicle will be applied in the morning to keep the 
blinding between groups.  
Subjec ts in all the groups will undergo a further 4 -week treatment -free period from Week 12 to 
Week 16 (End of Study).  
Subject  visits are scheduled at Screening (Visit 1), Baseline (Visit 2 - Day 1), and Weeks 4 
(Visit 3), 8 (Visit 4), 12 (Visit 5) and 16 (Visit  6). Clinical determinations of efficacy will be 
conducted based on clinically visible or palpable lesions of AK in the treated areas at Weeks 4, 
8, 12 and 16  in comparison to Baseline. Comparisons will be made between the different 
strengths and dosing re gimen s of DFD -07 (celecoxib) Cream  and Vehicle  Cream . 
Local cutaneous tolerability will be determined at Baseline (Visit 2 –Day 1) and visits 3 – 6 for 
all treated areas.  Other safety assessments include physical examinations (HEENT, lungs, heart, 
abdomen, skin, neurologic) laboratory assessments, electrocardiogram (EKG), vital signs (blood 
pressure, pulse  rate), urine pregnancy tests, and collection of adverse event data.   
Number of Subjects : 
A total of  approximately 240 subjects  with actinic keratosis of the face  and/or scalp  will be 
randomized into  four groups in a 1:1:1:1 ratio (60 subjects  in each group) at approximately 
20 centers.  
Diagnosis and Criteria for Inclusion / Exclusion:  
Inclusion:

The investigational products will be applied twice daily for 12 weeks to cover the entire lesional 
area on the face  and/or scalp.   The maximum amount of study product  applied  will be 0.5 g per  
application  to a 5 cm x 5 cm  area (single contiguous area) on the face and/or scalp for a 
maximum dose of 1.0 g per day.  
Duration of Treatment and  Study:  
Subjects  will treat the affected area  for a maximum of 12 weeks. The total expected study 
duration is 24 weeks including the Screening and Follow -Up Visits.  
Reference and Control Products, Dose and Mode of Administration:  
Subjects  will be treated  with either topical DFD -07 (celecoxib) Cream containing 1.25% or 
2.5% or the matching topical  Vehicle Cream . 
Criteria for Evaluation:  
Safety criteria:  
Safety assessments will be performed at each visit to include vital signs (blood pressure, pulse  
rate), urine pregnancy tests for women  of child bearing potential , local cutaneous tolerability 
evaluation (including erythema, edema, weeping/exudate, flaking/scaling/dryness, 
scabbing/crusting, erosion/ulceration, vesiculation/blistering), and collection of adverse event 
data.  
For the safety analysis, only treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs ) will be analyzed. 
Treatment -emergent adverse events will include any  adverse event  (AE) occurring during the 
treatment period. For pre -existing conditions, any condition  that worsens during treatment will 
be considered treatment -emergent.  
Efficacy Endpoints:  
Primary Endpoint :  
The proportion of subjects  with complete clearance of AK lesions at the End of Study  Visit , at 
16 weeks (absence of clinically visible or pa lpable AK lesions in the treatment area) for DFD -07 
(celecoxib) Cream , 2.5% BID  compared to Vehicle  Cream . 
Secondary Endpoints : 
1. Proportion of subjects with complete clearance of AK lesions at the End of Study Visit, 
for DFD -07 (celecoxib) Cream, 2.5% QD co mpared to Vehicle Cream.  
2. Proportion of subjects with complete clearance of AK lesions at the End of Study Visit, 
for DFD -07 (celecoxib) Cream, 1.25% QD compared to Vehicle Cream.

1 INTRODUCTION  
Actinic keratosis (AK) is caused by sun exposure and considered squamous cell carcinoma 
(SCC) in situ . It is the most common carcinoma in situ  of the skin. For Europe, prevalence was 
reported to be up to 49% among males and 28% among females ( Flohil et al., 2013 ). Prevalence 
increases with increasing age ( Memon et al., 2000 ). AK occurs most commonly in fair skinned 
individuals ( Fitzpatrick skin types I and II and, to a lesser extent, III).  
The standard of care is to remove AK when diagnosed, which can be achieved either by 
physical ablation (e.g. cryosurgery, curettage), chemotherapeutic agents (e.g. topical 5 -
fluorouracil, imiquimod, diclofenac, ingenol mebutate) or photodynamic therapy (PD T) with 
aminolevulinic acid or methylaminolevulinate.  
Solaraze®, which is widely used in the treatment of AK, contains 3% diclofenac in a gel 
formulation. The preparation is self -applied by the subject  over a period of 90 days.  
Diclofenac and celecoxib  (the substance used in this clinical trial ) are non -steroidal anti -
inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs ). NSAIDs act  against inflammation primarily by inhibiting 
cyclooxygenase (COX) enzyme activity.  The mechanism of action of topical diclofenac 3% gel 
(Solaraze) against AK lesions is unknown.  
Results of multiple in vitro  studies in cancer cell lines and in human tumor  xenograft mouse 
models have indicated that the type 2 isoform of the enzyme cycloxygenase is induced and plays 
critical roles in virtually all stages of tumor igenesis and proliferation (including tumor initiation, 
promotion, progression, survival, invasio n and  metastases)  in several pre -malignant conditions 
and malignancies, including those of the colon, breast, lung, skin, mouth, esophagus, stomach, 
pancreas, liver, prostate and blood ( Sobolewski  et al., 2010 ). However, inhibition of enzyme 
activity alo ne cannot explain the anti -tumor potential of the selective COX -2 inhibitor, 
celecoxib. In recent cell culture studies assessing the anti -proliferative effect in HaCat 
keratinocytes, celecoxib has shown a 9 -fold higher potency compared to diclofenac in ter ms of 
growth inhibition (unpublished data). There is accumulating evidence of COX -2 independent 
pathways contributing to the anti -tumor effect of celecoxib. These include enhancing tumor 
sensitivity to apoptosis and inhibition of cell proliferation ( Sobole wski et al., 2010 ). 
Topical diclofenac 3% gel, although better tolerated than many of the currently approved topical 
treatment modalities, requires twice a day treatment for 60 to 90 days and has limited efficacy as 
shown in Table 1:

 Therefore, there is still a need for a topical treatment option for AK, with one or more of the 
following attributes: once a day convenient application, faster onset of action, increased lesion 
clearance rate, and/ or fewer, or less severe, side effects. DFD -07, a cream formulation 
containing celecoxib, has shown promise of fulfilling this need in in vitro  cell culture studies 
(unpublished data). These in vitro  cell culture studies indicate that celecoxib is approximately 9 
times as potent as diclofenac in inhibiting the growth of HaCaT (human keratinocyte) cell lines.  
In a 13-week dermal toxicity study in rats, daily application of  prototype  DFD -07 cream 
formulations containing celecoxib concentrations of 0.3%, 0.6%, 1.25%, and 2.5% 
(corresponding to absolute celecoxib dose levels of 6, 12, 25 or 50 mg/kg  /day, respectively),  for 
90 consecutive days was well tolerated. No celecoxib -related dermal or system ic effects were 
noted. The reversible epidermal hyperplasia noted at the application site was attributed to 
Vehicle , and was considered non -adverse. Based on the results of this study, the NOAEL of 
DFD -07 for systemic and local effect was considered to be  more than 50 mg/kg/day   in both 
sexes under the conditions of testing in this study . 
In a study in minipigs , dermal administration of prototype DFD -07 cream formulations 
containing celecoxib concentrations of 0 .6%, 1.25%, and 2.5% (corresponding to absolute 
celecoxib dose levels of 12, 25, or 50 mg/kg/day , respectively)  was well tolerated. Reversible, 
non-adverse, dermal irritation was observed without any correlating microscopic changes in all 
animals of the placebo group and DFD -07-treated group s and was attribut ed to constituent(s) of 
the formulation other than the active ingredient celecoxib . There was no evidence of celecoxib -
related systemic toxicity and no target organs were identified. Accordingly, the NOAEL was 
considered to be more than 5 0 mg/kg/day under the conditions of this study.  
Celecoxib, a selective COX -2 inhibitor, is expected to have similar, if not better efficacy in 
clearing AK lesions  than topical diclofenac .

 2.3 Informed Consent  
Written informed consent from the subject must be obtained before a subject can participate in 
the study, prior to performing any study related procedures, and before with drawal of any 
therapie s prohibited during the study  (including the wash -out period, if needed) . Informed 
consent  is a process that is initiated prior to the subject ’s agreement to participate in the study 
and continu es throughout the subject ’s study partic ipation. The process involves an extensive 
discussion with the subject  about the study procedures and the risks and possible benefits of 
participation in the study.  
2.4 Selection  of Investigators  
Investigators for the study should be board certified derma tologists licensed in the state where 
the study is being conducted, with knowledge and understanding of Good Clinical Practice 
(GCP) and experience in treating AK. In some cases, qualified physicians who are not board 
certified dermatologists may participate based on training and experience in the treatment of 
AK.  Sub -investigators may be licensed physicians, physician assistants, or nurse practitioners 
with exper ience in AK or dermatology  and a good understanding of GCP . Investigators may 
delegate study tasks to other site personnel as long as they are qualified to perform the task  and 
the delegation is documented.

4 STUDY DESIGN  
4.1 Overall Plan  
This is a multi -center, rando mized, double -blind , parallel group,  Vehicle -controlled study.  The 
study products will be applied to a single contiguous  5 cm x 5 cm (25 cm2) treatment area 
containing the target lesions once or twice daily for a duration of 12 weeks of treatment with a 
4-week treatment -free follow -up. Subjects , who are at least 18 years old, diagnosed with AK of 
the face  and/or scalp  will be randomized to treatment in one of the following four arms (60 
subjects  in each group):  
Treatment Group  Dose Strength  Dose Duration  DFD -07 Cream  Vehicle Cream  
   AM PM AM PM 
1 1.25%  12 Weeks  - √ √ - 
2 2.5%  12 Weeks  √ √ - - 
3 2.5%  12 Weeks  - √ √ - 
4 Vehicle  12 Weeks  - - √ √ 
4.2 Discussion of Design  
The study consists of three phases: Screening (up to 60 days), Treatment (12 weeks)  and 
Follow -Up (4 weeks).  In Groups 2 and 4 , the randomized  investigational products will be 
applied twice daily for 12 weeks to cover the entire  single contiguous 5 cm x 5 cm (25 cm2) 
lesional area on the face  and/or scalp. In Groups 1 and 3, the randomiz ed active DFD -07 
(celecoxib) Cream product will be applied only in the evening, while the Vehicle for DFD -07 
Cream will be applied in the morning to keep the blinding between groups.  
Subjects  in all the groups will undergo a further 4 -week treatment -free period from Week 12 to 
Week 16 (End of Study).  
The investigational products will be applied twice daily for 12 weeks to cover the entire lesional 
area (5 cm x 5 cm) on the face  and/or scalp  identified by the Investigator for treatment . The dose 
for the study product will be a maximum of 0.5 g per application to the entire 5 cm x 5 cm area 
on the face and/or scalp for a maximum dose of 1.0 g per day.   
Subject  visits are scheduled at Screening (Visit 1), Baseline (Visit 2 - Day 1), and Wee ks 4 
(Visit 3), 8 (Visit 4), 12 (Visit 5) and 16 (Visit 6) . Clinical determinations of efficacy will be 
conducted based on clinically visible or palpable lesions of AK in the treated areas at Weeks 4, 
8, 12 and 16 in comparison to Baseline. Comparisons wil l be made between the different 
strengths and dosing regimen s of DFD -07 (celecoxib) Cream  and Vehicle  Cream . 
Local cutaneous tolerability will be determined at Visits 2 – 6 for the entire treated area.  Other 
safety assessments include physical examination s (HEENT, lungs, heart, abdomen, skin,

 dispensed as needed. Tubes will be weighed upon return and the weight will be recorded in the 
source documents.  Partially filled tubes can be re -dispensed back to the subject  after they have 
been weighed and the weight has been recorded in the source document.  The tear -off panel is to 
be affixed to the source document.  Subject  initials  and subject  number must be written on the kit 
label. Study staff will then dispense and instruct subject  on study product use.   
Dispensing and return of stud y product must be documented in the Investigational Product Site 
Dispensing and Return Log.  
Subjects  must return the used tubes even if empty throughout the trial.  At the end of the trial, all 
used and unused tubes must be returned to the clinic for event ual destruction by the Sponsor or 
designee. Any dispensed tubes that are not returned to the clinic must be documented on the log.  
6.1.4 Accountability  
Documentation of receipt, study product inventory, and return shipments of the study product 
must be maintain ed at each study site. Upon receipt of the study product supplies, an inventory 
must be performed. It is important that site personnel count and verify that the shipment 
contains all the items noted in the shipment record and that they are in good conditio n. At study 
completion, all containers of study product, used and unused, must be returned to the Sponsor or 
designee , or destroyed with the Sponsor’s approval .  
In addition, a study product accountability log showing dispensing to and return by subjects  
must be maintained at each study site. Any dispensed tubes that are not returned to the clinic 
must be documented on the log.  
6.1.5  Storage  
The study product  must be stored at controlled room temperature 20° -25°C (68° -77°F); 
excursions permitted to 15° -30°C  (59°-86°F).   
The Investigator agrees to use the study  product only within the framework of this clinical study 
and in accordance with this study protocol. Any unused, partially used or empty containers of 
the study  product will be returned to the  Sponsor or destroyed with the Sponsor’s approval after 
drug accountability has been done at the terminat ion of the study.  
Receipt, distribution and return of the study  product must be properly documented on the drug 
accountability form.  
6.2 Treatment Regimen  
Subje cts will use assigned study product  twice  daily (i.e. in the morning and in the evening, 
after any bathing or showering) with approximately 12 hours between applications  for 12 
consecutive weeks  starting from  Baseline/ Day 1 (Visit 2) during the study visit . After 
randomiz ation during the  Baseline/Day 1 Visit ( Visit 2), subjects  will apply the first dose of 
study medication in the Investigator’s office under supervision.  The a rea(s) of application must 
be washed (with an Investigator -approved cleanser) befor e the study product is applied. Subjects  
should be instructed to apply a dime  size amount of study product to the Investigator identified 
single contiguous treatment area  (5 cm x 5 cm) . Subjects  will be provided with a diary to record 
the timing of applica tion of the st udy medication on a daily basis. Starting with the first 
application during the Day 1 Visit, all applications  will be recorded in the subject  diary, which

 will be checked by the Investigator or designee for compliance and potential safety -related data 
at Visits 3-6. 
6.3 Treatment Precautions  
Study product s should not be used by any subject  with known or suspected hypersensitivity to 
any non-steroidal anti -inflammatory drugs ( NSAID s) or any component of the formulation of 
the study medication . Indications of hypersensitivity include a history of asthma, uticarial, or 
other allergic -type reactions after taking aspirin or other NSAIDs or known or suspected  allergy 
to sulfonamides . 
6.4 Treatment and Protocol Compliance  
Subjects  will be provided a n instruction sheet for the study product along with a diagram of 
affected areas to be treated. Study staff should review the instruction sheet and diagram with the 
subjects  at every visit  to ensure protocol compliance.  AK lesions are to be counted and upd ated 
within the t reatment area  on the diagram at each post-Baseline visit.  The first and last 
application of study product will be performed  by the subjects  at the site under supervision.   
At each post-Baseline visit until Visit 5 , the Investigator or designee will interview subjects  
concerning treatment compliance and ask if any doses have been missed. The Investigator will 
also ask about compliance with protocol requirements. Protocol deviations will be recorded in 
the subject ’s study r ecord , and on a protocol deviation form that will be provided to the site.  
These items may also be apparen t from the missing data on the CRF and will be identified 
programmatically during data analysis for purposes of reporting . The Sponsor should be 
consu lted before discontinuing subjects  due to protocol deviations unless safety is a concern.  
Subjects  will be provided a diary card for documenting the dates of applications . The subjects  
will review the diary card with the Investigator or designee at each visit. The number of 
applications applied and t he number of  missed applic ations will be recorded on the source 
documents . By definition, there are no missed applications after the last date of treatment even if 
recorded on t he diary.  
In addition, tubes of study product will be weighed before dispensing and after  the return of the 
investigational products. At the last visit, the tube should be weighed before and after the 
application to determine the amount of study product applied for the last dose.  Thes e weights 
should  be entered into the CRF.  
6.5 Method of Assigning Subjects  to Treatment Groups  
Subjects  will be assigned randomly via IWRS to one of four treatment groups in a 1:1:1:1 ratio 
(60 subjects  per treatment group) . A study medication assignment schedule will be created that 
is stratified by site , with kit numbers randomly assigned to study products.  A randomization 
schedule will be produced for each site independently for use in randomization by the IWRS.  
The date and time of randomization, as well as the kit number , will be entered on the eCRF.    
The Investigator shall ensure that the study product  is only used by subjects  under the 
Investigator's personal supervision or under the supervision of a sub-investigator responsible to 
the investigator and in accordance with the protocol.

 6.6 Blinding  
6.6.1 Method of Blinding  
This is a multi -center, randomized, double -blind, parallel group, Vehicle -controlled study.  The 
DFD -07 (celecoxib)  Cream and Vehicle Cream are whi te to off -white in color , and are similar  
in appearance, smell , and feel . The study medication kits (active and vehicle) will be marked for 
AM and PM use, so as to ensure blinding of the QD versus BID arms of the study. In the QD 
arms for the active product,  the active product marked PM will be applied in the evening while 
the vehicle product marked AM will be applied in the morning. Since the active and vehicle 
product are similar, the study blind is expected to be preserved by this approach.  
6.6.2  Unblindin g 
This is a double -blind study so neither Investigator nor subject  will know which medication they 
receive. DFD -07 (celecoxib) Cream , 1.25% and 2.5% , and its matching Vehicle  for DFD -07 
Cream will be  similar  in appearance and have identical packaging.  
The blind should be broken for all subjects suffering serious  adverse events ( SAE s) in which 
knowledge of the treatment assignment is critical to the subject ’s management. The blind for the 
subject  may be broken by the Investigator, or designee, by contacting the IWRS. The blind 
should not be broken at the study site level except in a medical emergency (where knowledge of 
the study medication received would affect the treatment of the emergency). Fo r a medical 
emergency, the blind must only be broken following discussion with Sponsor medical monitor,  
on a case -by-case basis, at the discretion of the Investigator/treating physician/Sponsor.  
If the blind is broken, the date, time, and reason must be re corded in the subject ’s source record, 
eCRF, and any associated adverse event ( AE) report. If an Investigator, site personnel 
performing assessments, or subject is unblinded, the unblinding incident and unblinded subject 
must be listed as a major protocol deviation. A subject  for whom the blind is broken will 
discontinue study medication and be scheduled for a n End of Study  safety follow -up visit and 
then discontinued from the study. The subject will be encouraged to stay in the study until the 
AE is resolv ed or stabilized. All Investigators and the IRB will receive blinded safety reports. 
However, on the request of the IRB, the Sponsor will send unblinded reports directly to the IRB.  
6.7 Prior and Concomitant Therapy  
Chronic medications being used at the ti me of the Screening and Baseline Visit, with the 
exception of those specified as prohibited, may be continued at the discretion of the 
Investigator. History of medications, therapies, and procedures are collected from the prior 6 -
month period for determina tion of eligibility. Only medications, therapies and procedures in use 
during the study should be entered on the eCRF.  
New medications used after Baseline , required for another medical condition, that in the opinion 
of the Investigator will have no materi al impact on the study, are permitted. The addition of 
such a new medication during the study will be documented as a concomitant medication and 
the associated medical need must be recorded as an AE, if applicable.   
All medications (topical, oral, prescri ption, over -the-counter, and herbal medications) and 
medical therapies or procedures  that are used during the study for other diseases/conditions must 
be recorded on the eCRF.

7 STUDY PROCEDURES AND EVALUATIONS  
7.1 Screening  
A separate Screening Visit (Visit 1) may be performed when a washout period is required or for 
scheduling purposes.  Alternatively, Visits 1 (Screening) and 2 (Ba seline/Day 1) may be 
combined if no washout period is required.  The subject  number, date of visit, date of informed 
consent, reason for screen failure (if applicable) and study status will be captured in the eCRF 
for every screen failure subject . The Basel ine/Day 1 (Visit 2) Visit must occur no later than 60 
days after the Screening Visit. Medical history should be collected for the prior 1 year period 
and concomitant medications, therapies, and procedures collected for the prior 6 -month period.  
Only ongoi ng medical conditions and ongoing concomitant medications should be entered into 
the eCRF.  
A screen failure is a subject  who received information about the study, including signing an 
informed consent and  possibly performing some study -related procedures , but was not 
randomized and/or did not use study product.

 7.2 Demographic and Baseline Characteristics  
Demographic variables include age (computed from date of birth and Baseline Visit date), race,  
ethnicity, weight, height and sex.  
7.3  Efficacy Variables  
Definition of the treatment area  
Prior to the first application of the study medication at Visit 2, the Investigator will define the 
treatment area. The subject must have 5  or more AK  lesions within a single contiguous 5 cm x 5 
cm (25 cm2) area of the face and/or scalp . Only a single 25 cm2 area will be treated per subject . 
If the subject has extensive lesions in an area spread over the face and scalp, the lesional area on 
the face will be preferably selected for treatment.  In order to determine  and identify the position 
of the treatment area at each Visit, a plastic grid foil will be laid on the treatment area(s)  and the 
contours of the treatment area (s) will be circumscribed. The lesions in the area will be 
circumscribed as well. Furthermore, f acial features like eyebrows, ears, etc. will be 
circumscribed and marked. The foil will be labelled with the subject  number  and filed in the 
source document . It will be used again at Visits 3 to 6 (EOS).  
The subject  will need to be instructed where the t reatment area is located. For this purpose, the 
Investigator will insert a drawing into the diary depicting the location of the treatment area.  
Subjects will be instructed to apply the study product  to the entire area as defined by this 
drawing.  
Efficacy a ssessment  
The treated area will be inspected visually and by palpation. This will always be done by the 
same Investigator at each investigational site  (unless the Investigator has delegated it to a 
trained designee, with proper documentation) . The number of AK lesions being either visible or 
palpable in the defined treatment area will be assessed at all study visits . All lesions in the 
treatment area will be included in the lesion count even if the lesion is  a new lesion tha t was not 
identifie d during the first Visit.  
7.4 Safety Variables  
Safety assessments include physical examination s (HEENT, lungs, heart, abdomen , skin, 
neurologic),  vital signs  (blood pressure, pulse  rate), 12-lead EKG s, 
hematology/chemistry/urinalysis  laboratory tests  (App endix 2), urine pregnancy tests for 
women of child bearing potential,  local tolerability evaluation  of the treated skin  (including 
erythema, edema, weeping/exudate, flaking/scaling/dryness, scabbing/crusting, 
erosion/ulceration, vesiculation/blistering) , and collection of adverse events (AEs)  data. Adverse 
events will be collected by spontaneous reports from subject , either verbal or recorded in the 
subject  diary, by directed questioning of subject , and by observation  (see Section 8  for details 
about AEs).  For female  subjects  of child bearing potential , urine pregnancy tests will be 
conducted at Screening, Baseline , and every subsequent visit . The test must have a sensitivity of 
at least 25  mIU/mL  for human chorionic gonadot ropin.  
Adverse events, whether believed by the Investigator to be  related or unrelated to treatment, will

 7.5  Drug Concentration Measurements  
Study drug concentration measurements will not be conducted in th is study . 
7.6 Early  Withdrawal of Subjects  
1. Subjects  should be withdrawn from the study if they no longer wish to participate, are being 
uncooperative, or if the Investigator feels that it is in the best interest of the subject  to 
withdraw.  
2. Subjects  with protocol deviations or for whom it is discovered should have been excluded 
should not be withdrawn unless there is a safety concern.  The protocol deviation should be 
recorded in the subject ’s source documents and the eCRF.  
3. If during the course of treatment a subject experienc es a cardiovascular or hematologic AE 
(including abnormal laboratory values) of Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse 
Events ( CTCAE ) Version  4.02 Grade 2 or higher, the study product will be discontinued and 
the subject will be withdrawn from the study.  
4. Subjects  who experience an AE resulting in or requiring discontinuation of study product 
use should be encouraged to be followed until the AE is resolved or stabilized.   
5. If a female subject becomes pregnant during the study, study product will be discont inued 
immediately and she will be followed through the pregnancy and delivery. Details of the 
pregnancy, delivery and health of the infant should be recorded on the Pregnancy 
Surveillance Form . The Sponsor will be notified immediately after the subject  is detected to 
be pregnant.   
6. At the time of study discontinuation, the Investigator will record the reason for early 
withdrawal, date of last study product application, date of last visit or contact, collect 
adverse event data, and, if possible, perform all End of Study Visit specific evaluations. 
Every attempt should be made to contact subjects  who are lost -to-follow -up. At least three 
attempts must be documented in the subject’s source document, including the use of at least 
one certified letter.  Any contact, either direct or indirect, should be made with the purpose to 
docum ent the final status of the subject  with regard to safety.  Subjects  who withdraw early 
will not be replaced.  
7.7 Modification of Protocol  
No amendments to this protocol can be made without consultation with  and agreement of the 
Sponsor, and IRB. Amendment s must be made in writing. Modifications needed for the safety 
of subjects  will be made immediately with notifications made as soon as possible.  
7.8 Early Termination of Study  
If it is determined by the Sponsor or Investigators that the study presents an unreasonable and 
significant risk to subjects , the study will be terminated as soon as possible, and in no event later 
than 5 working days following the determination that the study should be discontinued. The IRB 
and FDA must be notified as soon as possible about early termination of the study due to safety 
concerns.  
7.9 Data Safety Monitoring Board  
A Data Safety Monitoring Board will not be utilized in this study.

 7.10 Study Schedule  
A Study Schedule Chart can be fo und on page 9. There are at least 5 study visits; Screening 
(Visit 1), Baseline (Visit 2, Day 1 ), Week 4  (Visit 3), Week 8  (Visit 4), Week 12 (Visit 5 -End of 
Treatment) and 4 Weeks Post -Treatment (Visit 6  – End of Study ).  The Screening Visit and 
Baseline/Day 1 Visit may be combined into a single visit if no wash -out is required. The visit 
window is ±5 days for Weeks 4 , 8, 12 and 16.  Visits 1 and 2 cannot be separated by more than 
60 days.  
7.10.1 Visit 1 - Screening  Visit  
The Screening Visit should occur no more than 60 days before the Baseline Visit.  
1. Obtain written informed consent prior to initiating any study procedures  or before 
withdrawing any of the therapies prohibited during the study (including the wash -out 
period, i f needed) . Provide subject with signed copy of consent form. Document 
informed consent in the subject ’s study record.  
2. List the subject  on the Screening/Enrollment Log  and assign a subject  number . Subject  
numbers consist of the 2-digit site number followed by sequential 3 -digit numbers 
usually starting with 001 (e.g., 01-001, 01 -002 etc.). All subjects  including screen 
failures should be assigned a subject  number.   
3. Perform a urine pregnancy test on all female subjects  of child bearing potential . 
4. Collect demo graphic data – date of birth, sex, race, ethnicity , height and weight.  Review 
and record medical history, AK history (including naïve vs previous therapy, AK 
treatment received 12 months prior to screening, onset date for AK and first AK 
treatment), and co ncomitant medications , therapies , and procedures.  Medical history 
(including any cosmetic or therapeutic procedures, such as laser, peeling, and 
photodynamic therapy, within 2 cm of the selected treatment area and within the 2 weeks 
prior to the Baseline V isit) and AK history should be collected for the prior 1 -year 
period and concomitant medications , therapies , and procedures  collected from the prior 
6-month period. Only ongoing medical history items and ongoing concomitant 
medications should be entered on  the eCRF. AK history will be collected and recorded 
in the eCRF.  
5. Assess AK lesions (counting the visible and palpable lesions and measuring total area of 
lesions) to confirm that the subject  has a single contiguous 5cm x 5cm area that  qualifies 
for treatm ent on the face  and/or scalp.  If the subject has extensive lesions in an area 
spread over the face and scalp, the lesional area on the face will be preferably selected 
for treatment.    
6. Documentation of size and location of selected treatment area on grid foil 
7. Collect vital signs (blood pressure and pulse  rate). 
8. Screen subjects  according to the study inclusion/exclusion criteria to determine tentative 
eligibility. Initiate any protocol -required washout, if applicable.  
9. Schedule Visit 2 (Baseline/Day 1).  If no washout is required, Visit 1 and Visit 2 may be 
combined.  
7.10.2 Visit 2 - Day 1 - Baseline Visit   
If no washout is required, Screening and B aseline may occur on the same day.

8 ADVERSE EVENTS  
Adverse Events wil l be documented at Visits 2 to 6 . The definitions as laid down in GCP -V § 3 
(6) – (9) will be the basis for the safety assessments in this clinical study.  
Adverse events will be collected by spontaneous reports from subjects , either verbal or recorded 
in the subject  diary, by directed questioning of subjects , and by observation.  
Baseline assessments are made prior to first application. For medical conditions present at 
Baselin e, an adverse event should be recorded  at subsequent visits  if the severity is worse than 
Baseline.

   Page 33 of 49 
 An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject  participating in a clinical 
trial. The event does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with the study product . 
An adverse event can therefore be any sign, symptom, or disease, or any worsening of an 
existing sign, symptom, or disease, whether or not considered related to the study product  or 
trial procedures, including injuries.   
Any medical condition that is pr esent at the time of Screening or Baseline should be considered 
as medical history and r eported on the medical history CRF and should not be reported as an 
adverse event except for adverse e vents observed at the Baseline V isit due to study procedures 
perfo rmed a t the Screening V isit which should be reported. Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations 
of pre -existing conditions should not be reported as adverse events.  Unexpected worsening of 
pre-existing conditions should be reported as adverse events. The disease  or condition being 
studied or expected progression, signs, or symptoms of the disease or condition being studied 
should not be reported as an adverse event unless more severe than expected.  
All serious adverse events , all study -product -related adverse eve nts and all adverse events 
leading to study product  discontinuation must be followed until the clinical outcome is 
determined or until all attempts to determine resolution of the event are exhausted  (“not 
recovered ” is not an acceptable outcome for acute c onditions). For other adverse events, the 
status at the last visit can be entered into the CRF.  
8.1 Adverse Event Reporting Period  
Adverse event data must be collected from the time treatment is initiated until the Week 16/End 
of Study Visit takes place.  Adverse events occurring from the time of the Screening Visit until 
the Baseline Visit associated with study procedures should also be reported  for all subjects  
including screen failures .   
8.2 Recording Adverse Events  
All AEs will be documented including  
• Severity  (see 8.3.1: Severity for details)  
• Start and stop date  
• Causality assessment with study medication  
• Measures / action taken  
• Serious AE (yes/no)  
All AEs will be followed -up until resolution or the End of Study Visit and documented in  
CRF and subject ’s medical file.  
SAEs will be documented in the subject ’s medical file, the CRF and on the SAE -form. A copy 
of the SAE form will be emailed or faxed to the Sponsor and filed in the Investigator’s File.  
Local Reactions in the treatment area will be documented separately. The following local 
reactions will be assessed and documented:  
a. Erythema  
b. Edema  
c. Weeping/exudate  
d. Flaking/scaling/dryness

Per definition, all Local Reactions are caus ally related to the study treatment.  
All Local Reactions will be documented including  
• Severity  
• Start and stop date  
The severity of the local reactions is graded as follows:  
Grades  Score  Description  
None  0 No signs  of reaction  
Mild  1 Slight signs of reaction  
Moderate  2 Definite signs  of reaction  
Severe  3 Subject  discontinues study product  due to reaction  
The Investigator will record all adverse events, regardless of relationship to study product , on 
the adverse event CRF.  Standard medical terminology should be used when describing adverse 
events.  Whenever possible a diagnosis shou ld be made and recorded on the CRF rather than 
listing signs and symptoms. Intermittent adverse events can be recorded once. The anatomical 
location of the adver se event  must be specified , when  applicable , as well as whether the location 
is a treatment area . The following informa tion should be recorded on the CRF:  
1. Description  
2. Start  date 
3. Stop date or date of death , ongoing , or unknown  
4. Severity of the event (see 8.3.1: Severity  for details)  
5. Study product  use continued or not  
6. Outcome of the event ( recovered/ resolved, recovered/ resolv ed with sequelae,  not 
recovered/not resolved , unknown, fatal) 
7. Relationship to study product  (see 8.3.2: Relationship to Study Product (Causality)  for 
details)  
8. Indication of whether the event is serious (see 8.3.3: Seriousness for details ) 
9. Action taken including treatment with concomitant med ication  
8.3 Assessment of Adverse Events  
8.3.1  Severity  
It is the Investigator's responsibility to assess the severity of each adverse event. Descriptions of 
severity are as follows:

 1. Mild :  Awareness of sign or symptom, but easily tolerated. Not likely to interfere with 
normal activity or require medical attention.  
2. Moderate :  Discomfort enough to cause interference with usual activity. May require 
medical intervention.  
3. Severe :  Incapacitating such that normal activity is prevented.  Likely requires medical 
intervention and/or close follow -up. 
8.3.2  Relationship to Study Product  (Causality)  
It is the Investigator’s responsibility to assess the relationship between the study product  and the 
adverse event. The degree of “relatedness” of the adverse event to the study product  should  be 
described using the following categories:  
1. Not Related : The event is clearly due to extraneous causes (e.g., diseases, environment, 
etc.).  Specify if known . Or, the event is most probably  produced by other factors such as 
the subject ’s clinical state, therapeutic interv entions or concomitant therapy and does not 
follow a known response pattern to the study product . 
2. Possibly Related :  The event is temporally related to study product  use, but can be 
explained by another etiology.  Information on the effect of study product  withdrawal 
may be lacking.  
3. Probably Related :  The event is temporally related to study product  use and is consistent 
with known effects of the study product  and/or improves upon withdrawal of the study 
product .  
4. Definitely Related :  The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of 
study product  administration and/or follows a known response pattern to the study  
product, and could not have been produced by other factors such as the subject ’s clinic al 
state, therapeutic intervention or concomitant therapy, and either oc curs immediately 
following study  product administration, or improves on stopping the product, or there is 
a positive reaction at the application site.  
8.3.3  Seriousness  
It is the Investigator’s responsibility to determine the “seriousness” of an adverse event. A 
serious adverse event (SAE) is any adverse event occurring at any dose that results in any of the 
following outcomes:  
1. Death  
2. Life-threatening ( subject  at immediate risk of death)  
3. Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization  
4. Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
5. Results in congenital anomaly/birth defect  
Important medical events that may not result in death, are not life -threatening, or do not r equire 
hospitalization may be considered an SAE when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, 
they may jeopardize the subject  and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one 
of the outcomes listed above. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm

abuse.  
8.4 Reporting Serious Adverse Events  
SAE  informati on must be faxed or e-mailed  within 24 hours of becoming aware of the event.  
The minimum initial  informatio n required to be reported on the Serious Adverse Event Form is: 
the protocol number, site number, subject  number, subject  initials, the event, the causality, the 
date of the event and the name and contact information (email, phone number) of the person 
reporting the event. This initial report should be promptly followed up with a completed  Serious 
Adverse Event Form.  
Serious Adverse Events : Shahida Hasan , M.D., M.S.  
 Fax:  908-450-1510   
 Email:  SAE@drreddys.com  
The initial information must include a causality assessment that is provided by the primary 
Investigator or other medically qualified individual. The causality assessment can be amended 
as more information is available . Significant new information about  ongoing SAEs shou ld be 
reported promptly to the Sponsor.  
Serious adverse events will be evaluated by the Medical Monitor within 24 hours of receipt and 
plans for management and further reporting (i.e. FDA) determined.  
It is the respon sibility of the CRO, Integrium, LLC® to promptly notify the other Investigators 
involved in this study and they in turn notify their respective IRBs about serious and unexpected 
SAEs for which there is a reasonable possibility of their being related to the investigational 
product . 
Follow -up of Serious Adverse Events  
 
All follow -up reports will be subject to the same reporting timelines as the Initial  Reports. 
Within 24 hours of receipt of new information, the updated follow -up SAE  form, along with any 
supporting documentation (e.g ., subject  discharge summary or  autopsy reports), should be faxed 
or emailed to the Sponsor.  
8.5 Discontinuation Due to an Adverse Event  
The Sponsor  must be notified within 5 days if any subject  is withdrawn or discontinues study 
product  use due to an adverse event if AE is related to the study product  (see title page for 
contact information).   
8.6 Exposure in utero  (Pregnancy)  
If a female subject  becomes pregnant during the study, study product  must  be discontinued 
immediately and she must  be followed through the pregnancy and delivery . The Investigator 
should report the event to the Sponsor immediately  as described in Section 8.4 above  and 
complete a pregnancy surveillance  form. The expected date of delivery or expected date of the 
end of the pregnancy should be included in this information. The Investigator is instructed to 
contact the subject  every 3 months until the end of her pregnancy and report the outcome to the

pregnancy surveillance form.  
The following outcomes of pregnancy fall under the criteria for serious adverse events  and 
should be reported as such: delivery complications prolonging hospitalization, spontaneous 
abortion, still  birth, death of newborn baby, congenital anomaly, and anomaly in a miscarried 
fetus.  
9 DATA HANDLING AND RECORD KEEPING  
9.1 Confidentiality  
Information about study subjects  will be kept confidential an d managed according to the 
requirements of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. This regulation 
requires a signed authorization informing the subject  of the following:  
 What protected health information (PHI) will be collected from subjects in this study  
 Who will have access to that information and why  
 Who will use or disclose that information  
 The rights of a research subject  to revoke the  authorization f or use/disclosure of 
subject ’s PHI 
 Expiration of authorization  
In the event that a subject  revokes authorization to collect and use PHI, the Investigator, by 
regulation, retains the ability to use all information collected prior to the revocation of 
authorization. For subjects  that have revoked authorization s to collect and use PHI, attem pts 
should be made to obtain permission to collect at least vital status (i.e. that the subject  is alive) 
at the end of their scheduled study period.  
9.2 Source Documents  
Investigators must keep accurat e separate records (other than CRFs) of all subject  visits which 
include all pertinent study related information including original signed/dated informed consent 
forms. Source documents for this study include all written records of study data.  All study data 
must have a paper source document including Investigator assessments.   
9.3 Screening/Enrollment Log  
A Subject  Screening/Enrollment Log, noting reasons for screen failure where applicable, must 
be maintained for all subjects  who are consented. The log should also include subject initials, 
screening da te, subject number , and date of visit.    
9.4 Case Report Forms  
All data requested on the CRF must be recorded  on source documentation. The CRF cannot be 
the source document for any data. Detailed instructions a nd training for completing the CRF 
will be provi ded to the sites.  
Study subjects  are n ot to be identified by name on CRFs, but rather by coded identifiers ( subject 
number  and initials ). The Investigator or Sub-investigator must review all CRF pages for each 
subject and approve the group of CRFs pages for each  subject .

 9.5 Data Capture  
Study data will be entered into and  maintained in a 21 CFR Part 11 compliant database.  
9.6 Archiving of Study Documentation  
The Investigator must retain study records for 2 years following the date a marketing application  
is approved for the investigational product; or, if the application is not filed or is not approved, 
until 2 years after the investigation is discontinued and the FDA is notified.  
The Sponsor will inform the Investigator, in writing, as to when these docu ments no longer need 
to be maintained.  
All study documents, original source documents, correspondence, IRB documents, etc. are 
subject  to Sponsor and FDA inspection at any time.  
10 MONITORING AND DATA QUALITY ASSURANCE  
Only persons who are appropriately trai ned and who have the scientific and clinical knowledge 
to adequately monitor the study will be selected for monitoring this study. The monitor must 
have at least one year previous experience in monitoring clinical studies. The monitor should be 
familiar wi th the etiology and signs and symptoms of Actinic Keratosis and the treatment 
options that are currently available.   
Before study initiation, the Investigator and site personnel will receive protocol training from 
the Sponsor’s representatives to ensure c ollection of accurate, consistent, complete and reliable 
data. This training will take place either at an Investigator Meeting or individually on -site. 
During the course of the study, a monitor will make multiple site visits to check the progress of 
the study, review consent forms, review protocol compliance, assess drug accountability, and 
ensure that the study is being conducted according to the protoco l and Good Clinical Practice.  
Any review of the subjects ’ original medical records will be performed in a manner to ensure 
that subject  confidentiality is maintained. The Investigator will ensure that the monitor or other 
compliance auditor is given acces s to all study -related documents and has adequate time and 
space to conduct the monitoring visit including availability of the Investigator and site personnel 
to discuss findings.  
Data capture methods will be designed to ensure accurate transfer of data to  electronic media.  
The Sponsor’s Quality Assurance representative will conduct QA audits randomly or if needed 
at 5-10% of the investigat ional  sites.  
11 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS   
11.1 Sample Size  
The sample size estimation of this trial is based on the ass umption that the A ctive product 
exhibits a complete clearance of the AK lesions in 45% of the subjects, while the Vehicle does 
so in 20% of the subjects (a difference of 25% between the  Active and V ehicle treatment 
groups). Assuming a power of 80% and  of 0.05, in order to demonstrate the statistical 
significance of such an effect difference, 54 patients per treatment group would be needed.

 Considering the exploratory dose -response character of the trial, and assuming a drop -out rate of 
10%, 60 subject s need to be recruited in each treatment group. With 4 treatment groups in the 
study, it is planned to recruit approximately 240 subjects in the study.  
 11.2 Analysis Data Set  
11.2.1  Intent to Treat  
The intent -to-treat population (ITT) will be the primary effi cacy analysis data set and consists of 
all subjects who are randomized and dispensed study medication.  
Missing data for efficacy analysis will be replaced using last observation carried forward 
(LOCF).  If a subject withdraws early from the study, that subject’s efficacy assessments 
captured at the early termination visit will be assigned to the nearest corresponding scheduled 
visit that has been missed.  
11.2.2  Per Protocol  
The PP popu lation will include all subjects  in the ITT population who complete the Week  16 
evaluation without any major protoc ol violations (i.e., any subject or Investigator activity that 
could have possibly interfered with the therapeutic administration of the treatment or the precise 
evaluation of treatment efficacy).  
Specifically, the PP population will include subjects  in the ITT population who meet all of the 
following criteria:  
1. Subject met all inclusion/exclusion criteria.  
2. Subject  did not take any prohibited concomitant medications during th e evaluation 
period. The concomitant medication usage will be reviewed during the population 
determination review, remaining blinded to treatment designation, to determine 
prohibited medication usage that warrants exclusion from the PP population if they 
met the entry criteria without any protocol violations. This review will take into 
consideration the timing, duration of treatment with the concomitant medication, and 
influence on the efficacy and safety assessments prior to deeming a prohibited 
concomitan t medication as a protocol violation that warrants exclusion from PP.  
3. Completed the Week 16  visit within the allowed window.  
4. Subject  was compliant with the dosing regimen. A subject will be considered 
compliant if the subject applied at least 80% , but no more than 120% of the expected 
number of applications during  the entire treatment  period.  
Subjects  who prematurely discontinue from the study due to documented lack of efficacy, 
worsening condition, or a treatment -related AE will be included in th e PP population.  These 
subjects will be considered failures for all subsequent visits in the analysis of the primary and 
secondary endpoints of complete and partial clearance. Other than this, no imputations for 
missing data will be made for the PP populat ions.  
Other additional criteria may be added to the list to accommodate for unforeseen events that 
occurred during the conduct of the trial that result in noteworthy study protocol violations. 
These criteria will be documented with appropria te signature at  the time subject populations are 
finalized, prior to database lock.

 11.2.3  Safety Population  
All subjects who receive at least one confirmed dose of study product and provide any post -
baseline safety information will be included in the safety population. No imputation will be 
made for missing safety data.  
11.3 Demographic and Baseline Data  
Subject demographic and baseline data characteristics will be reported in descriptive summaries 
by treatment group for the Intent to Treat, Per Protocol and Safety popul ations.  
11.4 Efficacy Analyses  
Efficacy summaries will be provided for the Intent  to Treat and Per Protocol  populations . 
Descriptive statistics (N, arithmetic means, SD, mi nimum, median, maximum) for all 
continuous values and frequency tables for categorical variables will be created. With regard to 
primary and secondary objectives as descriptive statistical evaluation , absolute and relative 
frequencies of number of observations will be presented together with 95 % - confidence 
intervals.  
In case of missing values the last -observation -carried forward principle shall be applied.  
A statistical testing procedure Chi -Quadrat test or a lternatively a binomial testing procedure will 
be applied. In case of small sam ple sizes al ternatively Fisher's exact test may be applied.  Other 
tests may be applied as required and these will be enumerated in the Statistical Analysis Plan 
(SAP).  
Further details of the statistical evaluation procedure will be presented in the Statist ical Analysis 
Plan (SAP). Analysis sets ( ITT population,  safety population , per-protocol population , rational 
for exclusion from any  population ) will also be specified in the SAP.  
Primary endpoint  
For statistical assessment of the primary endpoint with a significance level of 0.05% the 
following underlying hypotheses are used:  
H0: p1 ≤ p2 vs. H1: p1 > p2  
where p1 is the treatment effect of 2.5%  DFD -07 (celecoxib) Cream  twice daily  and p2  is the 
treatment effect of the  Vehicle Cream  preparation.  
Secondary endpoints  
For statistical assessment of all product comparisons after ce rtain period of treatment (i.e. at 
Visits 3, 4, 5  and 6 ) with a significance level of 0.05% the following underlying hypotheses are 
used:  
H0: p1 ≤ p2 vs. H1: p1 > p2  
where p1 is the tr eatment effect of 1.25%  or 2.5%  DFD -07 (celecoxib) Cream  once daily and p2  
is the treatment effect of the  Vehicle C ream  preparation.  
For product and time point comparisons of medians, Mann -Whitney U -test and Wilcoxon -test 
may be applied.

 APPENDIX 1  - Declaration of  Helsinki (2013 ) 
 
Adopted by the 18th WMA General Assembly, Helsinki, Finland, June 1964, and amended by the:  
29th WMA General Assembly, Tokyo, Japan, October 1975  
35th WMA General Assembly, Venice, Italy, October 1983

64th WMA General Assembly, Fortaleza, Brazil, October 2013  
 
A. PREAMBLE  
1. The Wo rld Medical Association (WMA) has developed the Declaration of Helsinki as a statement of 
ethical principles for medical research involving human patient s, including research on identifiable 
human material and data.  
The Declaration is intended to be read as a whole and each of its constituent paragraphs should be 
applied with consideration of all other relevant paragraphs.  
2. Consistent with the mandate of the WMA, the Declaration is addressed primarily to physicians. T he 
WMA encourages others who are involved in medical research involving human patient s to adopt 
these principles.  
B. GENERAL PRINCIPLES  
3. The Declaration of Geneva of the WMA binds the physician with the words, “The health of my 
patient will be my first consideration,” and the international Code of Medical Ethics declares that,”A 
physician shall act in the patient’s best interest when providing medical care.”  
4. It is the duty of the physician to promote and safeguard the health, well -being and rights of pat ients,   
including those who are involved in medical research. The physician's knowledge and conscience are 
dedicated to the fulfillment of this duty.  
5. Medical progress is based on research that ultimately must include studies involving human patient s.   
6. The primary purpose of medical research involving human patient s is to understand the causes, 
development and effects of diseases and improve preventive, diagnostic and therapeutic interventions 
(methods, procedures and treatments). Even the best current in terventions must be evaluated 
continually through research for their safety, effectiveness, efficiency, accessibility and quality.  
7. Medical research is patient  to ethical standards that promote and ensure respect for all human patient s 
and protect their he alth and rights.  
8. While the primary purpose of medical research is to generate new knowledge, this goal can never take 
precedence over the rights and interests of individual research patient s. 
9. It is the duty of physicians who are involved in medical researc h to protect the life, health, dignity, 
integrity, right to self -determination, privacy, and confidentiality of personal information of research 
patient s. The responsibility for the protection of research patient s must always rest with the physician 
or oth er health care professionals and never with the research patient s, even though they have given 
consent.  
10. Physicians must consider the ethical, legal and regulatory norms and standards for research involving 
human patient s in their own countries as well as applicable international norms and standards. No 
national or international ethical, legal or regulatory requirement should reduce or eliminate any of the 
protections for research patient s set forth in this Declaration.  
11. Medical research should be conducted in a manner that minimizes possible harm to the environment.

 12. Medical research involving human patient s must be conducted only by individuals with the 
appropriate ethics and scientific education, training and qualifications. Research on patients or healthy 
volunteers requires the supervision of a competent and appropriately qualified physician or other 
health care professional.  
13. Groups that are underrepresented in medical research should be provided appropriate access to 
participation in research.  
14. Physicians  who combine medical research with medical care should involve their patients in research 
only to the extent that this is justified by its potential preventive, diagnostic or therapeutic value and if 
the physician has good reason to believe that participat ion in the research study will not adversely 
affect the health of the patients who serve as research patient s. 
15. Appropriate compensation and treatment for patient s who are harmed as a result of participating in 
research must be ensured.  
C. RISK, BURDENS AND B ENEFITS  
16. In medical practice and in medical research, most interventions involve risks and burdens.  
Medical research involving human patient s may only be conducted if the importance of the objective 
outweighs the risks and burdens to the research patient s. 
17. All medical research involving human patient s must be preceded by careful assessment of predictable 
risks and burdens to the individuals and groups involved in the research in comparison with 
foreseeable benefits to them and to other individuals or groups  affected by the condition under 
investigation.  
Measures to minimize the risks must be implemented. The risks must be continuously monitored, 
assessed and documented by the researcher.  
18. Physicians may not be involved in a research study involving human patients unless they are 
confident that the risks have been adequately assessed and can be satisfactorily managed.  
When the risks are found to outweigh the potential benefits or when there is conclusive proof of 
definitive outcomes, physicians must assess whet her to continue, modify or immediately stop the 
study.  
D. VULNERABLE GROUPS AND INDIVIDUALS   
19. Some groups and individuals are particularly vulnerable and may have an increased likelihood of 
being wronged or of incurring additional harm.  
 
All vulnerable groups  and individuals should receive specifically considered protection.  
 
20. Medical Research with a vulnerable group is only justified if the research is responsive to the health 
needs or priorities of this group and the research cannot be carried out in a non -vulnerable group. In 
addition, this group should stand to benefit from the knowledge, practices or interventions that result 
from the research.  
 
E. SCIENTIFIC REQUIREMENTS AND RESEARCH PROTOCOLS  
 
21. Medical research involving human patient s must conform to general ly accepted scientific principles, 
be based on a thorough knowledge of the scientific literature, other relevant sources of information, 
and adequate laboratory and, as appropriate, animal experimentation. The welfare of animals used for 
research must be r espected.  
 
22. The design and performance of each research study involving human patient s must be clearly 
described and justified in a research protocol. The protocol should contain a statement of the ethical 
considerations involved and should indicate how the principles in this Declaration have been 
addressed. The protocol should include inf ormation regarding funding, sponsors, institutional

 affiliations, potential conflicts of interest, incentives for patient s and information regarding provisions 
for treating and/or compensating patient s who are harmed as a consequence of participation in th e 
research study. In clinical trials, the protocol must also describe appropriate arrangements for post -
trial provisions.   
 
F. RESEARCH ETHICS COMMITTEES  
 
23. The research protocol must be submitted for consideration, comment, guidance and approval to the 
concer ned research ethics committee before the study begins. This committee must be transparent in 
its functioning, must be independent of the researcher, the sponsor and any other undue influence and 
must be duly qualified. It must take into consideration the l aws and regulations of the country or 
countries in which the research is to be performed as well as applicable international norms and 
standards but these must not be allowed to reduce or eliminate any of the protections for research 
patient s set forth in this Declaration. The committee must have the right to monitor ongoing studies. 
The researcher must provide monitoring information to the committee, especially information about 
any serious adverse events. No amendment to the protocol may be made without c onsideration and 
approval by the committee. After the end of the study, the researchers must submit a final report to the 
committee containing a summary of the study’s findings and conclusions.  
 
G. PRIVACY AND CONFIDENTIALITY  
 
24. Every precaution must be taken to protect the privacy of research patient s and the confidentiality of 
their personal information.  
 
H. INFORMED CONSENT  
 
25. Participation by individuals capable of giving informed consent as patient s in medical research must 
be voluntary. Although it may be appr opriate to consult family members or community leaders, no 
individual capable of giving informed consent may be enrolled in a research study unless he or she 
freely agrees.  
26. In medical research involving human patient s capable of giving informed consent, ea ch potential 
patient  must be adequately informed of the aims, methods, sources of funding, any possible conflicts 
of interest, institutional affiliations of the researcher, the anticipated benefits and potential risks of the 
study and the discomfort it may  entail, post -study provisions and any other  relevant aspects of the 
study. The potential patient  must be informed of the right to refuse to participate in the study or to 
withdraw consent to participate at any time without reprisal. Special attention sho uld be given to the 
specific information needs of individual potential patient s as well as to the methods used to deliver the 
information. After ensuring that the potential patient  has understood the information, the physician or 
another appropriately qual ified individual must then seek the potential patient 's freely -given informed 
consent, preferably in writing. If the consent cannot be expressed in writing, the non -written consent 
must be formally documented and witnessed. All medical research patient s should be given the option 
of being informed about the general outcome and results of the study.  
27. When seeking informed consent for participation in a research study the physician should be 
particularly cautious if the potential patient  is in a dependent rel ationship with the physician or may 
consent under duress. In such situations the informed consent should be sought by an appropriately 
qualified individual who is completely independent of this relationship.  
28. For a potential research patient  who is incapab le of giving informed consent, the physician must seek 
informed consent from the legally authorized representative. These individuals must not be included 
in a research study that has no likelihood of benefit for them unless it is intended to promote the 
health of the group represented by the potential patient , the research cannot instead be performed with 
persons capable of providing informed consent, and the research entails only minimal risk and 
minimal burden.

 29. When a potential research patient  who is deemed incapable of giving informed consent is able to give 
assent to decisions about participation in research, the physician must seek that assent in addition to 
the consent of the legally authorized representative. The potential patient 's dissen t should be 
respected.  
30. Research involving patient s who are physically or mentally incapable of giving consent, for example, 
unconscious patients, may be done only if the physical or mental condition that prevents giving 
informed consent is a necessary cha racteristic of the research group. In such circumstances the 
physician must seek informed consent from the legally authorized representative. If no such 
representative is available and if the research cannot be delayed, the study may proceed without 
inform ed consent provided that the specific reasons for involving patient s with a condition that 
renders them unable to give informed consent have been stated in the research protocol and the study 
has been approved by a research ethics committee. Consent to rem ain in the research should be 
obtained as soon as possible from the patient  or a legally authorized representative.  
31. The physician must fully inform the patient which aspects of their care are related to the research. The 
refusal of a patient to participat e in a study or the patient’s decision to withdraw from the study must 
never adversely affect the patient -physician relationship.  
32. For medical research using identifiable human material or data, such as research on material or data 
contained in biobanks or similar repositories, physicians must seek informed consent for its collection, 
storage and/or reuse. There may be exceptional situations where consent would be impossible or 
impracticable to obtain for such research. In such situations the research may be  done only after 
consideration and approval of a research ethics committee.  
I. USE OF PLACEBO  
33. The benefits, risks, burdens and effectiveness of a new intervention must be tested against those of the 
best proven intervention(s), except in the following circums tances:  
a. Where no proven intervention exists, the use of placebo, or no intervention, is acceptable; or  
b. Where for compelling and scientifically sound methodological reasons the use of any 
intervention less effective than the best proven one, the use of plac ebo, or no intervention is 
necessary to determine the efficacy or safety of an intervention and the patients who receive 
any intervention less effective than the best proven one, placebo, or no intervention will not 
be patient  to additional risks of seriou s or irreversible harm as a result of no t receiving the 
best proven intervention. Extreme care must be taken to avoid abuse of this option.  
J. POST -TRIAL PROVISIONS  
34. In advance of a clinical trial, sponsors, researchers and host country governments should make  
provisions for post -trial access for all participants who still need an intervention identified as 
beneficial in the trial. This information must also be disclosed to participants during the informed 
consent process.  
K. RESEARCH REGISTRATION AND PUBLICATION AND DISSEMINATION OF RESULTS  
35. Every research study involving human patient s must be registered in a publicly accessible database 
before recruitment of the first patient .  
36. Researchers, authors, sponsors, editors and publishers all have ethical obligations wi th regard to the 
publication and dissemination of the results of research. Researchers have a duty to make publicly 
available the results of their research on human patient s and are accountable for the completeness and 
accuracy of their reports. All partie s should adhere to accepted guidelines for ethical reporting. 
Negative and inconclusive as well as positive results must be published or otherwise made publicly 
available. Sources of funding, institutional affiliations and conflicts of interest should be d eclared in 
the publication. Reports of research not in accordance with the principles of this Declaration should 
not be accepted for publication.  
37. In the treatment of an individual patient, where proven interventions do not exist or other known 
intervention s have been ineffective, the physician, after seeking expert advice, with informed consent

 from the patient or a legally authorized representative, may use an unproven intervention if in the 
physician's judgment it offers hope of saving life, re -establishi ng health or alleviating suffering. This 
intervention should subsequently be made the object of research, designed to evaluate its safety and 
efficacy. In all cases, new information must be recorded and, where appropriate, made publicly 
available.

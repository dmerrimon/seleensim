Title:  MKit: A Pilot Study Testing a Life Skills Application to  Address 
Interpersonal Relationships in College  
Study Description:  This study utilizes implementation science principles to culturally 
adapt a pre- existing web -based application (WebApp) for use with 
college students. We will use the ADAPT -ITT process to adapt the 
WebApp to a diverse (race, ethnicity, gender/sexual identi ty) college 
population with a focus on life skills and holistic self -care as 
reinforcement to currently available primary prevention programming 
available to freshman students. Our hypothesis is that the adapted WebApp will be safe, acceptable, and student s will be willing to use it 
as a reinforcement to current university primary prevention programming.  
Objectives : • Primary: To evaluate the safety, usability, acceptability, and 
willingness of using the adapted WebApp among a randomized sample of 300 first year university students.  
• Secondary: To complete preliminary evaluations on efficacy measures such as sexual victimization/perpetration, rape myth acceptance, and power in sexual relationships to allow for power calculations for a future R -level submission . 
Endpoints : • Primary: Safety (qualitative interviews), Usability  (System 
Usability Scale, Brooke, 1986), Acceptability (investigator generated), and willingness to use (qualitative interviews).  
• Secondary: Sexual victimization/perpetration (Sexual Experiences Survey, Koss et al., 2007), Illinois Rape Myth Acceptance – Modified (McMahon & Farmer, 2011), Sexual Relationship Power Scale (Pulerwitz, Gortmaker, & DeJong, 2007)

There have been minimal attempts at providing reinforcement for students around the primary 
prevention of sexual violence and nobody has approached this topic with the consideration of holistic well- being in mind. Many of the currently available primary prevention programs 
include a one -time interaction and do not provide reinforcement throughout the student’s college 
career (Banyard, Moynihan, & Plante, 2007; Foshee et al., 2004; Moynihan et al., 2015; Taylor, Mumford, & Stein, 2015; Ta ylor, Mumford, Stein, & Woods, 2015). Principles of learning 
suggest that attitude change and skill training are more effective with reinforcement (Skinner, 1958).
 There is a need for holistic interventions that provide students with the means to address 
all of the physical, emotional, and social changes they may be experiencing during their 
transition to young adulthood. Past research has emphasized that life skills and social 
competency are promising approaches that address individuals within their ecolog ical context 
(Krug, Mercy, Dahlberg, & Zwi, 2002).  
With a national annual incidence rate of 5%, rape is the most frequent violent crime that occurs 
on college campuses  (Finn, 1995; Fisher, Cullen, & Turner, 2000). Nearly 80 -90% of college 
students know the perpetrator, which increases the likelihood that the rape will be c ompleted, 
rather than attempted (Fisher et al., 2000; Karjane, Fisher, & Cullen, 2005). Furthermore, many college survivors do not perceive or ac knowledge their experiences as a rape, often because of 
lack of evidence, the absence of a weapon, or because alcohol and/or drugs were involved (Fisher, Daigle, Cullen, & Turner, 2003; Karjane et al., 2005) . These characteristics of sexual 
assault in college therefore contribute to the underestimation, under reporting, under prosecution, and low rates of seeking post -assault services among college survivors  (Bondurant, 2001; 
Karjane et al., 2005).  
Despite the high prevalence of rape in the United States, an event with long -term negative effects 
on a survivor’s health, few survivors receive comprehensive post -assault care. In the period 
immediately following a rape, about half of all survivors will have evidence of physical trauma, up to 30% contract a sexua lly transmitted infection (STI), and 5% of female survivors become 
pregnant  (Resnick et al., 2000). Specific to college survivors, about 20% report physical injuries  
(Fisher et al., 2000) , many fear social consequences so they alienate themselves from camp us 
activities or drop out of school, and it appears that college women who experience post -traumatic 
stress disorder (PTSD) from an assault may use substances and/or sexual behavior to reduce distress (Messman -Moore, Ward, & Brown, 2009) . Post -assault, sur vivors can access 
comprehensive health services through referral by rape crisis centers or via the emergency department from specially trained sexual assault nurse examiner (SANE) programs. Comprehensive care includes 1) treatment of physical injuries or other sequelae of the assault, 2) pregnancy prevention including options if emergency contraception is not effective, 3) STI screening and treatment, 4) psychological care for PTSD, 5) forensic and victim services, and 6) legal care including safety from th e perpetrator and the ability to report the assault and press 2          INTRODUCTION

2.2       BACKGROUND

 6 charges if the survivor desires  (Tjaden & Thoennes, 2006) . However, only one in five women 
raped as an adult reported their rape to the police and of these reported rapes prosecution rates 
were only 37%  (Tjaden & Thoennes, 2006) . Thus, the prevalence of rape is under reported, 
under prosecuted, and many women do not seek care after experiencing rape due to multiple barriers to care (Munro, 2014) .  
Even with the high prevalence and severe physical  health, mental health, and social outcomes 
associated with sexual violence, there are limited data available on effective primary prevention programs  (Centers for Disease Control, 2016) . A recent systematic review of primary prevention 
programs for sexual  violence identified only three primary prevention strategies that have 
demonstrated significant effects on sexual violence including Safe Dates , Shifting Boundaries , 
and the 1994 Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) Funding  (DeGue et al., 2014) . However, 
there are promising trends that favor multisectoral programs that engage stakeholders to 
challenge the acceptability of violence and the underlying social risk factors. There is strong consensus among researchers that more rigorous evaluation of promising programs is needed in order to continue to address sexual violence  (Ellsberg et al., 2015) .  
Furthermore, recent national legislation has also highlighted the need for primary prevention of sexual violence. The Dear Colleague Letter  issued by the Obama Admini stration in 2011 
recommended that institutions of higher education implement preventive education programs focused on sexual  violence for incoming students.  The 2014 VAWA prescribed more specific 
recommendations that new students and employees must be offe red primary prevention and 
awareness programs focused on domestic violence, sex ual assault, stalking, and rape. The 2014 
VAWA acknowledged specific content that should be included in these programs but did not stipulate how these programs were to be admini stered to incoming students. Thus, each institute 
of higher education implements primary prevention programming individually, often using a 
combination of web- based, in- person, and performance based methods.  
Many  college  campuses  rely on online  learning  modules  to meet  the requirements  of the 2014 
VAWA;  however, there  is a lack  of evidence  on the  effectiveness  of these programs  and the 
potential  that mobile  or web -based  applications  hold for the  prevention of  sexual  violence.  
Technology  has become  a ubiqui tous modality  for communication  and accessing  knowledge  
across  the United  States.  In 2011 the  White  House  called  for initiatives  that leveraged  technology  
to prevent  dating  and sexual  violence  (Rosenthal, 2013) . This  resulted  in the creation  of a mobile  
application  called  Circle  of 6 (http://www.circleof6app.com/
), which  makes  it easy  to contact  a 
person in  your circle to  let them  know  where you are and  what  you need. More  recently,  a 
randomized controlled trial at  a university  in the Southeastern  United  States  found a  web -based  
bystander  intervention approach,  RealConsent, significantly  reduced  sexual  violence  perpetration  
and increased  knowledge  around consent, intervening,  and rape myths  and decreased  negative  
attitudes  around hostility  toward  women  (Salazar,  Vivolo- Kantor, Hardin, & Berkowitz, 2014) . 
However,  neither  of these technology -based  approaches  targets  the social  and cultural  
constructions  of sexual  violence  that promote  gender  inequality  and discrimin ation  nor do they  
offer holistic  approaches  to primary  and secondary  prevention (Dartnall  & Jewkes,  2013) . 
A holistic  approach  recognizes  college  students  as individuals  transitioning  into young  
adulthood. The  transition  into young  adulthood is  associated  with  myriad  of preventable  health  
problems  including  higher  rates  of mortality  and more  involvement  in heal th risk behaviors  
(Ozer  et al., 2012) . Additionally, college  students  are often  learning  to manage school, work, 
new relationships, stress,  conflict,  and their  own  health  for the  first time  as independent  young

 7 adults. A  holistic  approach aims  to identify  the student’s  goals  and needs  by increasing  their  
ability  to make decisions  based  on their  personal  values  while  also addressing  communication  
skills  in interpersonal  relationships  as an upstream  approach  to reduce  sexual  violence  in the 
campus  community. Positive  and respectful  communication within  interpersonal  relationships  
may help  prevent  some  types  of unwanted sexual  activity.  Furthermore, when  students  make 
decisions  consistent  with  their  values,  they  may  be less likely  to engage  in behaviors  or 
enco unter  situations  where  sexual  assault  perpetration or  victimization  could occur.  
 
2.3.1     KNOWN POTENTIAL RISKS  
There is no more than minimal risk to the study subjects. There is a rare risk that a participant 
may experience emotional discomfort related to survey or semi -structured interview questions. 
All participants will receive resources to help alleviate any potential discomfort and will have the opportunity to skip any questions they choose. The rare possibility of br each of confidentiality 
exists. All data will be stored on a secure, HIPAA -compliant server and drive with m onitored 
and controlled access to reduce this risk.  
2.3.2     KNOWN POTENTIAL BENEFITS  
The study participants will have the direct  benefit of receiving information through a  holistic, 
life-skills approach to addressing interpersonal relationships and sexual violence. This content 
may help them to navigate their own relationships. 
2.3.3      ASSESSMENT OF POTENTIAL RISKS AND BENEFITS  
The minimal risks associated with this study are reasonable given the potential impact of the 
project. The results of this study will provide the basis to scale -up this innovative intervention to 
reach a high -risk and vulnerable group, as college females a re among those at the highest risk for 
sexual violence. This study therefore provides the opportunity to develop a low -cost/high -impact 
reinforcement intervention that could improve interpersonal relationships and reduce sexual violence within college camp uses.  As such, the available information suggests that the present 
clinical study has an acceptable risk -benefit ratio.  
 
Objectives  Endpoints  Justification for Endpoints  
Primary    
To evaluate the safety, 
usability, acceptability, and 
willingness of using the 
adapted WebApp among a randomized sample of 300 first year university students. Safety will be assessed 
through qualitative interviews  
 Usability will be measured through the System Usability Scale (Brooke, 1986)  
 The endpoints are common 
outcomes of interest for studies of technological interventions. These outcomes will be measured throughout the study, to observe changes overtime 
with continued exposure to 2.3       RISK/BENEFIT ASSESSMENT

Willingness to use will be 
assessed through qualitative

endpoints are important 
outcomes, as interventions must be safe, acceptable, and usable to ensure broad scale uptake.  
Secondary    
To complete preliminary 
evaluations on efficacy measures such as sexual victimization/perpetration, rape myth acceptance, and power in sexual relationships to allow for power calculations for a future R -
level submission.  Sexual 
victimization/perpetration will be measured  using the 
Sexual Experiences Survey  
(Koss et al., 2007)  
 Rape myth acceptance will be measured using the Illinois 
Rape Myth Acceptance –  
Modi fied (McMahon & 
Farmer, 2011)  
 Relationship power differentials will be measured using the Sexual Relationship Power Scale (Pulerwitz, Gortmaker, & DeJong, 2007)  The endpoints are important , 
as the WebApp under study is a primary sexual violence preven tion intervention. As 
such, experiences of sexual violence victimization and perpetration, as well as rape myth acceptance and relationship power ( both 
upstream factors contributing to sexual violence perpetration) are outcomes of interest. Though this pil ot 
study is not powered to detect changes in these secondary outcomes, obtaining data for power calculations for a larger study is a key 
component of this study.  
 
 
This project builds on the current momentum to address the primary prevention of sexual 
violence within United States institutions of higher education as well as the proliferation of web -
based applications. We will test a culturally and contextually adapted evidence- based 
application, MKit,  with incoming university students (age range expected to be 18- 25 years old) 
using the ADAPT -ITT (Assessment, Decision, Adaptation, Production, Topical experts, 
Integration, Training, Testing) framework (Wingwood & DiClemente, 2008). The web -based 
application was created through collaborati on with students, stakeholders, and topical experts 
and developed by the Center for Health Communications Research (CHCR) through a modification of the pre -existing iCON platform. This process will allow us to translate clinical 
research on the life skills approach to impact the health and well -being of university students.  
A before -and-after quasi -experimental, mixed -method pilot design will be used to gather 
acceptability and safety data as well efficacy trends. Two res idence halls (West Quad and South 4          STUDY DESIGN

 9 Quad) at the University of Michigan will be randomized to receive either: (1) the control arm 
(n=150) which will receive usual care only (all incoming students receive three programs about healthy relationships and sexual violence including Haven, Relationship Remix, and Change it Up) or (2) the usual care (n=150) described above and the web- based interven tion (MKit). We 
will use cluster -randomization by residence hall (to minimize contamination associated with 
individual -level randomization of students living in the same residence hall). Following the 
informed consent process, students in both conditions w ill complete a b aseline survey of 85 
questions . Baseline measures will include: 1) demographic data, 2) 20 items from the Sexual 
Experiences Survey (SES) will measure past experiences with sexual violence (Koss et al., 2007), 3) investigator developed ques tions on knowledge about sexual violence, 4) 22 items 
from the modified Illinois Rape Myth Acceptance Scale to measure attitudes endorsing rape myths (McMahon & Farmer, 2011), and 4) 6 items from the Sexual and Relationship Power Scale (SRPS) will measure the multidimensional nature of power in relationships (Pulerwitz & Barker, 2000). All of these are measures have been validated and used extensively in the United States to measure knowledge and attitudes related to gender based violence. Following the survey, students in the Intervention group will be given the opportunity to interact with the 
application at their own pace, choosing which content to view in the order they prefer.  
The Control group will only receive the usual care delivered to all incoming  University of 
Michigan students, which includes Haven (an online course about sexual violence), Relationship Remix (an interactive program about healthy relationships and sexual violence delivered by peers), and Change it Up (a theater based performance o n bystander intervention). The 
Intervention group will receive the usual care described above as well as access to the adapted web-based application. They will be encouraged to interact with the web -based application 
throughout the study. Data will be coll ected on the content viewed by the participants, as well as 
the amount of time they spend within each content area, and the order in which they view the 
content. 
At 3 and 6 months, we will repeat all baseline measures in both groups. Participants in the 
Intervention group will a lso be asked to complete the 10- item System Usability Scale (Brook e, 
1996) and an investigator creates 5 -item acceptability scale.  
Post-intervention semi -structured interviews will be conducted with 25 participants including 15 
participants from the intervention group and 10 participants from the control group to assess 
perceived safety, reaction to content, desirability, willingness to continue using the content, and willingness to recommend the content to others. Prior to commencin g the interviews, we will ask 
each participant to complete a paper demographic survey.  
This is a  before -and-after quasi -experimental, mixed -method pilot design with three survey 
collection points and a pos t-study semi -structured interview component. This study will be 
performed with healthy college students to determine the safety, acceptability, and usability of the WebApp.  
The endpoints are common outcomes of interest for studies of technological interve ntions. These 
outcomes will be measured throughout the study, to observe changes over  time with continued 
exposure to the intervention. These endpoints are important outcomes, as interventions must be 
safe, acceptable, and usable to ensure broad scale upta ke. As the WebApp under study is a

and perpetration, as well as rape myth acceptance and relationship power (both upstream factors contributing to sexual violence  perpetration) are outcomes of interest. Though this pilot study is 
not powered to detect changes in these secondary outcomes, obtaining data for power calculations for a larger study is a key component of this study.  
This study compares usual care for the prevention of sexual violence with care as usual plus the intervention. Both groups will receive interventions currently in place, ensuring that standard care is not withheld from any participant. As the intervention under study is intended to supplement and reinforce current  primary prevention programming, the study design will 
measure the acceptability and preliminary efficacy of broad scale -up of the intervention to the 
broader college campus.  
Intervention group participants will have six months to interact with the WebApp content, as this 
time period should present sufficient time for meaningful short -term change in the outcomes of 
interest. Further, the study will run for the duration of the school year, allowing study staff to follow students from the beginning of the school year to the end of the school year as they 
interact with the WebApp content. 
A participant is said to have completed t he study if he or she has completed all three surveys, 
including the baseline, 3- month, and 6- month surveys, shown in the SOA.  
 
For the pilot study, individuals who meet the following criteria will be considered eligible to 
participate in the study : 
1. Currently enrolled as a student at the participating university  
2. Participated in Relationship Remix in Fall 2017 as a first- year or transfer student  
3. Willing to participate in the study  
4. Able to speak and read English  
For the semi -structured interviews, individuals who meet the following criteria will be

As all participants will be recruited directly from Relationships Remix, a program for currently 
enrolled University of Michigan students, all participants are exceedingly likely to be eligible for the study given the inclusion criteria.  
Students from the target sample, first- year University of Michigan college students, will be 
recruited for the study. Two residence halls (West Quad and South Quad) at the University of Michigan will be randomi zed to receive either: (1) the control arm  (n=150)  which will receive 
usual care only (all incoming students receive three programs about healthy relationships and sexual violence including Haven, Relationship Remix, and Change it Up) or (2) the usual care (n=150) described above and the web- based intervention (MKit). We will use cluster -
randomization by residence hall (to minimize contamination associated with individual- level 
randomization of students living in the same residence hall). At the end of the Relationship Remix program, a brief announcement w ill be made about the opportunity to participate in a 
research study about healthy relationships and palm cards will be distributed (see recruitment materials). We will recruit specifically from Relationship Remix to ensure that all experimental 
and control subjects receive the same primary prevention programming currently in place on campus. Interested students will receive a palm card with a link to either the MKit web -based 
application (Intervention) with an access code to sign- up for the website, or a l ink to the baseline 
consent and Qualtrics survey (Control) without access to the web -based application. At the end 
of the study, students from each condition will be invited to participate in an in- person semi -
structured interview. Students will receive th e invitation to participate in the semi- structured 
interview on the final page of their 6 -month follow -up survey. Students who opt to share their 
email address with the study team at that time will be contacted to set -up an in- person interview 
based on use r status for the intervention (consistent user of MKit, frequent user of MKit, 
minimal user of MKit) and a diverse group based on gender, race/ethnicity, and age for the control group. Semi -structured interviews will be conducted with participants from bot h the 
Control group (n=10) and the Intervention group (n=15).  
The Intervention group will receive the usual care described above as well as access to the adapted web -based application. They will be encouraged to interact with the web- based 
application throughout the study. Built -in reminders to the web- based application, an email alert, 
and a text -message alert (if the participant chooses to share their phone number) remind 
participants about their goals and encourage retention and continued engagement. 5.2       EXCLUSION CRITERIA

The efficacy of this study is not a primary outcome as this is a pilot study focused on safety, 
acceptability, usability, and willingness to use. However, a number of measures will be used to 
gather preliminary data for future scale- up at all three time po ints (baseline, 3 -months, and 6-
months). Study participants’  experiences with sexual violence (victimization and perpetration) 
will be assessed with 20 items from the Sexual Experiences Survey (SES) (Koss et al., 2007). Endorsement of rape myths will be me asured with 22 items from the modified Illinois Rape 
Myth Acceptance Scale (McMahon & Farmer, 2011). The m ultidimensional nature of power in 
relationships  will be measured by 6 items from the Sexual and Relationship Power Scale (SRPS)  
(Pulerwitz & Barker, 2000). All of these are measures have been validated and used extensively in the United States to measure knowledge and attitudes related to gender based violence.  
Additionally, knowledge about healthy relationships will be assessed with an investigator created 8-item scale.  
The safety of the WebApp will be assessed through post -intervention sem i-structured interviews, 
conduct ed with 25 participants including 15 participants from the intervention group and 10 
participants from the control group.  
 
Adverse event means any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of an 
intervention in humans, whether or not considered intervention- related (21 CFR 312.32 (a)).  
An adverse event (AE) or suspected adverse reaction is consi dered "serious" if, in the view of 
either the investigator or sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes: death, a life -
threatening adverse event, inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, a 
persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect. Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require hospitalization may be considered serious whe n, based upon 
appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the participant and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outc omes listed in this definition.  8          STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES

For adverse events (AEs) not included in the protocol defined grading system, the following 
guidelines will be used to describe severity.  
• Mild – Events require minimal or no treatment and do not interfere with the participant’s 
daily activities.  
• Moderate – Events result in a low level of inconvenience or concern with the therapeutic 
measures. Moderate events may cause some interference with functioning.  
• Severe – Events interrupt a participant’s usual daily activity and may require systemic drug therapy or other treatment. Severe events are usually potentially life- threatening or 
incapacitating.  Of note, the term “severe” does not necessarily equate to “serious”.  
All adverse events (AEs) must have their  relationship to study intervention assessed by the study 
staff. The degree of certainty about causality will be graded using the categories below. In a 
clinical trial, the study product must always be suspect.  
• Related  – The AE is known to occur with the s tudy intervention, there is a reasonable 
possibility that the study intervention caused the AE, or there is a temporal relationship between the study intervention and event. Reasonable possibility means that there is evidence to suggest a causal relationsh ip between the study intervention and the AE. 
• Not Related  – There is not a reasonable possibility that the administration of the study 
intervention caused the event, there is no temporal relationship between the study intervention and event onset, or an alternate etiology has been established.  
The Principle Investigator will be responsible for determining whether an adverse event (AE) is expected or unexpected.  An AE will be considered unexpected if the nature, severity, or frequency of the event is not consistent with the risk information previously described for the study intervention.  
The occurrence of an adverse event (AE) or serious adverse event (SAE) may come to the attention of study personnel during study visits and interviews of a study participant upon review by a study monitor.  
All AEs including local and systemic reactions not meeting the criteria for SAEs will be captured on the appropriate case report form (CRF). Information to be collected includes event description, time of onset, clinician’s assessment of severity, relationship to study product (assessed only by those with the training and authority to make a diagnosis), and time of 8.3.3     CLASSIFICATION OF AN ADVERSE EVENT

appropria tely regardless of relationship. All AEs will be followed to adequate resolution.  
Changes in the severity of an AE will be documented to allow an assessment of the duration of the event at each level of severity to be performed. AEs characterized as interm ittent require 
documentation of onset and duration of each episode. 
The Clinical Research Coordinator  will record all reportable events with start dates occurring 
any time after informed consent is obtained until the last day of study participation. Events  will 
be followed for outcome information until resolution or stabilization.  
The Primary Investigator  will immediately re port to the sponsor any adverse event, whether or 
not considered study intervention related, including breach of confidentiality or lack of safety 
whether there is a reasonable possibility that the study intervention caused the event. All  adverse 
events (AEs) will be followed unt il satisfactory resolution or until the site investigator deems the 
event to be chronic or the participant is stable. Other supporting documentation of the event may be requested by the study sponsor and should be provided as soon as possible.

 18 Primary Endpoint: The WebApp is safe, usable, acceptable, and participants will be willing to 
use the WebApp.  
Secondary Endpoint: The  explore preliminary differences between the intervention and c ontrol 
groups  in regards to experiences  of sexual violence victimization and perpetration, rape myth 
acceptance, and sexual relationship power. 
Formal sample size calculations were not performed  because this is a pilot feasibility study . The 
number of subjects was chosen based on feasibility and is considered sufficient to meet the study 
objectives.  
All data collected through the pilot study process will be utilized for the analyses related to feasibility, usability, and acceptability . The data collected from the semi -structured interview 
subjects will be  utilized to analyze the safety of the application and the willingness of 
participants to use the application.  
 
9.4.1     GENERAL APPROACH  
The survey data will be analyzed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences  (SPSS); all 
p-values will be set at <.05. Descriptive statistics will be assessed first. The baseline, 3 -month 
post, and 6- month post -intervention tests will be examined for measures of central tendency, 
measures of dispersion, and frequency distribution on outcomes. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) 
will be utilized to determine if the scores on the baseline and follow -up tests differ significantly 
among the two arms. Usability and acceptability scores will be assessed among those in the intervention group.  
We are not powered to assess outcome measures (sexual violence experiences/behaviors, rape 
myth acceptance, or sexual relationship power ); however, we will look at the direction of effects 
for our outcome measures to allow for power calculations for a future  R-Level submission. The 
results of this project will establish the safety and usability of this adapted web -based application 
for future scale -up. 
For the semi -structured interviews, all audiotapes  will be transcribed verbatim. Data analyses 
will be conducted using an iterative process and the constant comparative method of analysis (Glaser, 1992). Member checking will contribute to credibility through validation of the research findings by particip ants. A codebook will be developed after repeated high -level reading of the 
transcripts by the study team. Data will be coded and grouped into categories to facilitate abstraction and concept analysis.  9.2      SAMPLE SIZE DETERMINATION

The safety of the WebApp and the willingness of participants to use the WebApp will be 
assessed through post -intervention sem i-structured interviews, conducted with 25 participants 
including 15 participants from the intervention group and 10 participants from the control group. The usability for the WebApp will be assessed at two time points (3 -months and 6- months) using 
the 10- item System Usability Scale (Brook e, 1996 ). The acceptability of the WebApp will be 
assessed at two time points (3 -months and 6- months) usi ng an investigator created 5 -item 
acceptability scale. Usability and acceptability scores will be assessed among those in the intervention group.  
For the semi -structured interviews, all audiotapes will be transcribed verbatim. Data analyses

transcripts by the study team. Data will be coded and grouped into categories to facilitate 
abstraction and concept analysis. An audit trail will be established to allow others to follow the 
decisions made by the research team (Sandelowski  & Barroso, 2003). The results of the semi -
structured interviews will be used to: 1) update the content of the WebApp, as needed; 2) assess the safety of the WebApp; 3) assess the usability and willingness to use the WebApp; and 4) assess the acceptability  of the WebApp.

10.1.1.1     CONSENT/ASSENT AND OTHER INFORMATIONAL DOCUMENTS  
                  PROVIDED TO PARTICIPANTS  
Consent forms describing in detail the study intervention, study procedures, and risks are given to the participant and electronic documentation of informed consent is required prior to starting intervention/administering study intervention.  The following consent materials are submitted with this protocol:  
• Pilot Control Group Consent Form  
• Pilot Intervention Group Consent Form  
• Semi -Structured Interview Consent Form  
10.1.1.2     CONSENT PROCEDURES AND DOCUMENTATION
 
Informed consent is a process that is initiated prior to the individual’s agreeing to participate in the study and continues throughout the individual’s study participation. Consent forms will be Institutional Review Board (IRB) -approved and the participant will be asked to read and review 
the document. For the pilot study, participants will read through the consent online prior to completion of the baseline survey and make the determination to participate in the study individually. The participant will sig n the informed consent document prior to any study 
activities . Participant s will be informed that participation is voluntary and that they may 
withdraw from the study at any time, and that the study is not connected to their schooling . 10         SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION AND OPERATIONAL CONSIDERATIONS

 21 For the semi -structu red interview, t he investigator will explain the research study to the 
participant and answer any questions that may arise. A verbal explanation will be provided in 
terms suited to the participant’s comprehension of the purposes, procedures, and potential risks of the study and of their rights as research participants.  Participants will have the opportunity to carefully review the written consent form and ask questions prior to signing. The participant will sign the informed consent document prior to any s tudy activities . Participant s will be informed 
that participation is voluntary and that they may withdraw from the study at any time, and that the study is not connected to their schooling . A copy of the informed consent document will be 
offered to the par ticipants if they would like it. The informed consent process will be conducted 
and documented in the source document (including the date), and the form signed, before the participant undergoes any study -specific procedures.  
10.1.2     STUDY DISCONTINUATI ON AND CLOSURE
 
This study may be temporarily suspended or prematurely terminated if there i s sufficient 
reasonable cause. Written notification, documenting the reason for study suspension or termination, will be provided by the suspending or terminating party to study participants, funding agencies, and regulatory authorities. If the study is prematurely terminated or suspended, 
the Principal Investigator will promptly inform study participants, the Institutional Review Board (IRB), and sponsor and will provide the reason(s) for the termination or suspension.  Study 
participants will be contacted, as applicable, and be informed of changes to study visit schedule.  
Circumstances that may warrant termination or suspension include, but ar e not limited to:  
• Determination of unexpected, significant, or unacceptable risk to participants  
• Insufficient compliance to protocol requirements  
• Data that are not sufficiently complete and/or evaluable  
• Determination that the primary endpoint has been met  
• Determination of futility  
Study may resume once concerns about safety, protocol compliance, and data quality are addressed, and satisfy the sponsor and/or IRB.  
10.1.3     CONFIDENTIALITY AND PRIVACY
 
Participant confidentiality and privacy is strictly held  in trust by the participating investigators,  
their staff, and the sponsors  and their interventions. Therefore , the study protocol, 
documentation, data, and all other information generated will be held in strict confidence. No information concerning the st udy or the data will be released to any unauthorized third party 
without prior written approval of the sponsor.  
All research activities will be conducted in as private a setting as possible.  Study participants can 
choose to interact with the WebApp and take study surveys whenever is comfortable and safe for them to do so.  
The information we collect will only be seen by the research team. We will not link the email 
address or any identifiable  information of any participant to any of the survey or application use 
data collected. All data will be reported in aggregate. Research data will be stored on a secure, 
MKit Protocol   Version 1.1  
   11 August 2017  
 22 HIPAA -compliant server and drive with monitored and controlled access for study staff and 
investigators. The web -based survey wil l be hosted on secure servers.  
The WebApp is hosted on virtualized servers provided by the University of Michigan 
Information Technology Services group. The virtualized servers are housed at two redundant data centers. These data centers provide protection from lengthy outages, 24/7 staffing, restricted physical access and disaster recovery. Virtual servers are backed up automatically onto encrypted tape for recovery and security. The data centers also reduce the use of physical resources such as electricity and air conditioning.  
All servers and the back end databases are password protected. The server runs the RedHat Linux 7 Enterprise operating system. Security patches and updates are downloaded and installed automatically. Each server is also protected by firewalls to restrict network access to the server. 
The study web application software communicates directly with the database on the same server so unencrypted participant data is not transmitted on the Internet.  
For the semi -structured interviews , we will not use names on any written documents or on digital 
audio recordings. All participants will be assigned unique, coded, confidential identifiers (code numbers), which will be used to label all notes, memos, and transcripts. The key linking the participant’s identity to their unique coded identifier will be kept in a confidential manner in a database on a secure server, with access only by the Primary Investigator  and the research staff. 
We will protect all ph ysical documents by securing them in a locked file drawer in the PI’s 
locked office.  
For both the quantitative and qualitative data, we will discuss data in aggregate with no reference to identification of any individual in particular. The participants will decide if they want to share their email address with the study team to participate in the semi- structured interview portion of 
the study. Interviews will be held in a private room on campus. 
10.1.4     FUTURE USE OF STORED SPECIMENS AND DATA
 
All retained data will be stored for five years and will be de -identified. We will protect all 
physical documents by securing them in a locked file drawer of the PI’s locked office. Research 
data will be stored on a secure, HIPAA -compliant server and drive with monitored and 
controlled access for study staff and investigators. We will discuss data in aggregate with no reference to identification of any individual in particular.

10.1.9     DATA HANDLING AND RECORD KEEPING  
 
10.1.9.1     DATA COLLECTION AND MANAGEMENT RESPONSIBILITIES  
Data collection is the responsibility of the clinical trial staff at the site under the supervision of the site investigator. The investigator is responsible for ensuring the ac curacy, completeness , and 
timeliness of the data reported.  
The WebApp is hosted by the Center for Health Communications Research (CHCR) at the University of Michigan. They will make de -identified data available for study personnel on a 
dashboard. They will also make emails available in batches only (not connected with data) to allow study personnel to send incentives.  
Semi -structured interview recordings are the responsibility of the study staff and will be saved to 
a secure, password -protected computer in a timely manner. Digital audio files will be tran scribed 
and deleted within 6 months of recording.  
10.1.9.2     STUDY RECORDS RETENTION  
Study documents should be retained for a minimum of 2 years after the last approval of a 
marketing application in an International Conference on Harminosation (ICH) reg ion and until 
there are no pending or contemplated marketing applications in an ICH region or until at least 2 years have elapsed since the formal discontinuation of clinical development of the study intervention. These documents should be retained for a l onger period, however, if required by 
local regulations. No records will be destroyed without the written consent of the sponsor, if

no longer need to be re tained.  
10.1.10     PROTOCOL DEVIATIONS  
A protocol deviation is any noncompliance with the clinical trial protocol, International 
Conference on Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice (ICH GCP), or Manual of Procedures (MOP) requirements. The noncompliance may be either on the part of the participa nt, the 
investigator, or the study site staff. As a result of deviations, corrective actions are to be developed by the site and implemented promptly.  
These practices are consistent with ICH GCP:  
• 4.5 Compliance with Protocol, sections 4.5.1, 4.5.2, and 4.5.3  
• 5.1 Quality Assurance and Quality Control, section 5.1.1  
• 5.20 Noncompliance, sections 5.20.1, and 5.20.2.  
It is the responsibility of the site investigator to use continuous vigilance to  identify and report 
deviations. All deviations must be addre ssed in study source documents and sent to the 
reviewing Institutional Review Board (IRB) per their policies. The site investigator is 
responsible for knowing and adhering to the reviewing IRB requirements.

    STUDY SUMMARY  
Title:  The Safety and Efficacy of Psilocybin as an A djunctive  Therapy in 
Participants with Treatment -Resistant Depression  
EudraCT Number:   
2018‐002577‐22  
Clinical Phase:  2 
Rationale:  A recent open -label study of the effects of psilocybin in participants with 
treatment -resistant depression (TRD) showed rapid significant decrease of 
depressive symptoms after treatment with psilocybin coupled with 
psychological support. Over 40% of participants sustained response at 
3 months. In this study, the aim is to explore effectiveness of 25  mg of 
psilocybin as an adjunctive therapy in pa rticipan ts with TRD.  
Target Population:  TRD  
Number of Participants:  Approximately 20  participants  with simultaneous study drug 
administration to up to six participants  
Objectives:   The main purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy of 25  mg 
psilocybin adjunct to serotonergic antidepressants in TRD participants  via 
the following objectives.  
Primary Objective  
The primary objective of this study is to explore the efficacy of 25  mg 
psilocybin  as an adjunct therapy to antidepressants  in improving 
depressive symptoms.  
Secondary Objective s 
The secondary objective  is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of 
psilocybin in participants with TRD based on adverse events (AEs), 
changes in vital signs, electrocardi ogram s (ECGs ), clinical laboratory tests 
and suicidal ideation/ behavior  (measured using the Columbia -Suicide 
Severity Rating Scale [C -SSRS ]) score.  
Explorato ry Objective  
The exploratory objective s are to evaluate the effects of psilocybin on 
quality of life, wellbeing and anxiety . 
Study Design:  This is a Phase IIb, international multi center , fixed -dose, open -label  study . 
The study population will include adult men and women, 18  years of age  
or older , with TRD. Participants with TRD are defined as those who meet 
the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (5th Edition; 
DSM -5) diagnostic criteria for single or recurrent episode of major 
depressive disorder (MDD) without psychotic features which have failed 
to respond to an adequate dose and duration of 2, 3 or 4 pharmacological 
treatments for the current episode; the duration  of the current episode must 
be at least 3 month s but not more than 2 years .  
Participants will be outpatients and will be recruited primarily through 
referrals from general practitioners and specialised psychiatric services.  
After signing the informed co nsent form (ICF), participan ts will be 
assessed for their eligibility with the Mini International Neuropsychiatric 
Protocol   
Study Number COMP00 3 – Psilocybin for TRD ( P-TRD)  Confidential  
Psilocybin  Page 5 of 80 
 
 
   
 Version 1.0 – Final – 11 Sep 2019   
    Interview, Version 7.0.2  (MINI  7.0.2 ), the Hamilton Depression Rating 
Scale ( 17-item; HAM -D-17), the Massachusetts General 
Hospital -Antidepre ssant Treatment History Response Questionnaire  
(MGH -ATRQ) , the C-SSRS , and McLean Screening Instrument for 
Borderline Personality Disorder . At the initial Screening visit (V1), the 
participant will also be evaluated with the Quick Inventory of Depressive 
Symptomatology – Self Rated - 16 item (QIDS -SR-16). Additionally, a 
medical history, an ECG, blood tests , and vital signs will be obtained.  
Once a participant  completes all Screening ( V1) assessments and all 
screening data is  entered into the Electronic Data Capture ( EDC ), the 
Medical Monitor ( MM) and Clinical Assessment Technologies Team 
(CAT ) will review data entered and issue approval, if the participant  is 
eligible.  
The p articipant will meet with a therapist for a minimum of 3 visits during  
screening. These ar e safety sessions  and will cover  what to expect during 
the psilocybin session. The therapist and the participant will review 
psychoeducational materials provided  at the time of enrolment . 
All participants wil l be evaluated for safety  at the clinic  weekly for a 
minimum of 3 weeks prior to psilocybin administration .  Any safety 
assessment visits during the screening period will be called V1a, V1b, etc. 
During these visits, the C-SSRS  and any changes in medicatio ns since the 
previous visit will be obtained in addition to other assessments at the study 
clinician’s discretion.  
At Baseline [ V2, Day -1], the participants will undergo a baseline 
assessment  that will consist of the  HAM -D-17, Montgomery -Asberg 
Depression Rating Scale (MADRS ), Clinical Global Impression – Severity 
scale (CGI -S) and Improvement scale (CGI -I), QIDS -SR-16, C-SSRS , 
Generalised Anxiety Disorder Scale  7-item Scale  (GAD -7), Euro QoL -5 
dimension -3 level (EQ-5D-3L; administered to both participant and 
caregiver [the latter is not mandatory]) , Medication Adherence Report 
Scale – 5 item (MARS -5), vital signs, urinalysis, urine drug screen, and 
urine pregnancy test (only for women  of childbearing potentia l). After 
basel ine data is entered into EDC , the CAT team will complete a final 
review to ensure the participant’s continued eligi bility. Participants cannot 
be progressed to V3 until this approval is received.  
The psilocybin administration session (V3, Day 0) will last approximately 
6 h and will be supported by a trained therapist. The study drug will be 
administered simultaneously to up to six participants.  Blood pressure will 
be monitored continuously during the session.  The psilocybin session may 
be video recorded for training and adherence monitoring. A full 
description of the activities of the psilocybin administration session is 
found in the Therapist  Manual. After the acute effects of the psilocybin 
pass, participants will be evaluated for safety and accompanied  home. On 
Day 1 (V4), the day following psilocybin administration, participants will 
be seen in person for a safety check, assessment of suicida lity and clinical 
and self -report  assessment s, and to discuss their experience during the 
psilocybin session. All sessions between the therapist and the participant 
may be audio recorded  for adherence monitoring and quality assurance. 
Audio and video recor ding of the sessions are subject to participant 
consent. Participants who do not consent to either or all recordings will not 
be excluded from the study.

Statistical Procedures : Analysis Sets  
The Safety Population will consist of all enrolled participants , regardless 
of whether or not treated.  This population will be used for all summaries 
of participant accountability, demographic and baseline data, and safety 
information, including AE inciden ce.  
The Full Analysis Set (FAS) will consist of all enrolled participants who 
receive the dose of investigational product (IP). 
The Per Protocol (PP) Population will consist of all participants in the FAS 
who do not have a major protocol deviation defined as a deviation which 
may significantly affect efficacy for that participan t. Major protocol 
deviations will be reviewed and determined prior to databas e lock .  
Efficacy Analyses  
Since this is a single treatment open -label study, no statistical testing will 
be performed. The FAS and the PP populations will both be used for each 
secondary endpoint, if the two sets are not identical. For each of the 
seconda ry endpoints ( MADRS,  CGI-S, C-SSRS ), measuring change from 
Baseline to Week  3, summary statistics will be provided.  
Analysis of exploratory endpoints will be detailed in the Statistical 
Analysis Plan (SAP). 
Safety  Analyses  
Safety data will be presented for the Safety Population. Safety will be 
evaluated based on AEs, ECGs, clinical laboratory tests, vital signs and 
suicidal ideation/ behavior  (measured using C-SSRS ).

    1 INTRODUCTION  AND RATIONALE  
The following is a summary of the information found in the current Investigator’s 
Brochure  (IB).7 
1.1 Background  
Psilocybin belongs to a class of drugs re ferred to as psychedelics ( meaning 
‘mind -manifesting’). Specifically, psilocybin is considered a 5 -hydroxytryptaminergic 
(serotonergic)  psychedelic , along with other tryptamines such as dimethyltryptamine 
(DMT), ergolines such as lysergic acid diethylamide  (LSD), and phenethylamines such as 
mescaline. Psilocybin was first isolated from psilocybe mushrooms by Hofmann in 1957, 
and later synthesised by him in 1958.22 Psilocybin has been used in psychiatric research 
and in psychodynamic orientated psychotherapy from the early to mid -1960s up until it 
became a Schedule 1 substance in the US in 1970, and until the 1980s in Germany .22,23 
Research on the effects of psilocybin resumed in the mid -1990s, and it is currently the 
preferred compoun d for use in clinical research of 5 -hydroxytryptaminergic  
psychedelics ,4,10,16 because it has a shorter duration of action and suffers from less 
notoriety and stigma than other similar drugs.  
1.2 Study Rationale  
Carhart -Harris conducted an open -label feasibility study in 12 patients ( six men and 
six women) with moderate -to-severe, unipolar, treatment -resistant major depression 
(ISRCTN 14426797).3 Each patient received two oral doses of psilocybin (10 mg and 
25 mg, 7  days apart) in a supportive setting. There was no control group. Psychological 
support was provided before, during, and a fter each session. The primary outcome 
measure was patient -reported intensity of psilocybin’s effects. Patients were monitored 
for adverse events ( AEs) during the dosing sessions and at subsequent clinic and remote 
follow -ups. Depressive symptoms were asse ssed using the  Quick Inventory of Depressive 
Symptomatology – Self Rated - 16 item  (QIDS -SR-16); QIDS -SR-16 scores were 
obtained from Week 1 to 3  months following dosing. Psilocybin's acute psychedelic 
effects were detectable 30  to 60 minutes (min) after d osing, peaked 2  to 3 hours (h) after 
dosing, and subsided at least 6  h after dosing. Mean self -rated intensity (on a scale of 0 -1) 
was 0.51 ( standard deviation [ SD] 0.36) for the low -dose session and 0.75 (SD 0.27) for 
the high -dose session. Compared to Baseline, depressive symptoms were markedly 
reduced 1 week (means QIDS -SR-16 difference -11.8, 95% confidence interval 
(CI) -9.15 to -14.35, p=0.002, Hedges’ g=3.1) and 3 months ( -9.2, 95% CI -5.69 
to -12.71, p=0.003, Hedges’ g=2) after high -dose treatment. Marked and sustained 
improvements in anxiety and anhedonia were also noted. Psilocybin was well tolerated 
and no serious or unexpected AEs were reported. The AEs noted were transient anxiety 
(12/12 patients, 100%) during psilocybin onset, transient confusi on or thought disorder 
(9/12 patients, 75%), mild transient nausea (4/12  patients, 33%), and transient headache 
(4/12 patients, 33%).

 Version 1.0 – Final – 11 Sep 2019   
    This study provides further  support for the safety and efficacy of psilocybin for 
treatment -resistant depression (TRD) and motivates further studie s to better examine the 
therapeutic potential of this approach . In this study, the aim is to explore effectiveness of 
25 mg of psilocybin as an adj unctive therapy in participants with TRD . In addition, there 
is one ongoing study, COMP001, examining the safety and efficacy of psilocybin in 
participants with TRD  and one study  which has completed the in -clinic phase , 
COMP002, looking at the effects of psilocybin on c ognitive and emotional function in 
health y participants . 
1.2.1  Pharmacokinetics  
Psilocybin is detectable in plasma 20  to 40 min after oral administration of 0.224 mg/kg 
(10-20 mg total dose).14 Orally ingested psilocybin is metabolised  (dephosphorylat ed) in 
the liver, and primarily  transformed into the active hydrox y metabolite, psilocin . 
Psilocybin is detectable in plasma 30  min after administration  14,17,20,22 and psilocin is 
detectable  in plasma 15 to 50  min after oral administration of 0.2  mg/kg psilocybin. 
Therefore, psilocybin is essentially a prodrug and psilocin represents the 
pharmacologically active agent  in systemic circulation . The elimination half -life of 
psilocybin is 50  min.20 Psilocin’s half -life ranges between 2 and 3  h, and is detectable 6  h 
after oral administration.14,20 Hasler et al.14 and Lindenblatt et al. 20 reported similar but 
not identical findings, with peak levels of psilocin appearing between 80  to 105 min and 
psilocin half -life ranging between 2.25  h for 0.2  mg/kg and 2.7  h for 0.22  mg/kg. The 
majority, 80%, of psilocin in plasma was found to be in a conjugated form. Both psilocin 
(at 90 -97%) and psilocybin (3 -10%) are detectable in hu man urine, unmodified (only 
3-10%) and particularly conjugated with gluc uronic acid.15 The majority of psilocin 
recovered in urine is excreted withi n 3 h after oral administration and is completely 
eliminated from the body within 24  h.15 
1.2.2  Preclinical Pharmacology  
Psilocybin and its active metabolite psilocin directly affect a number of 5 -HT receptor 
subtypes without directl y affecting other neurotransmitter systems.  
Human psilocybin research has confirmed the importance of 5 -HT 2A stimulation for the 
psychedelic effects of psilocybin and psilocin as the effects can be blocked by a 5 -HT 2A 
receptor antagonist.31 Reviews of the pharmacology of psilocybin is provided by Passie, 
and more current knowledge and perspective by Tylš et al.22,30 
When assessed for potential effects on the hu man-ether -à-go-go related gene channel 
psilocybin was shown to be without significant effects when tested up to concentrations 
of 1 mM.  
Although the literature on the effect of psilocin at the 5 -HT 2B is somewhat contradictory, 
the most recent publication b y Rickli et al. indicates that the  half-maximal effective 
concentration (EC 50) for activation of the 5 -HT 2B receptor is greater than 20 μM.24 That 
concentration would generally be considered to be pharmacologically inactive in vivo  
Protocol

Psilocybin  Page 17 of 80 
 
 
   
 Version 1.0 – Final – 11 Sep 2019   
    because plasma concentrations would never reach 20 μM or greater after a single 
administration of psilocin.  Brown et al. indicate that the maximal plasma concentration 
achieved after a single dose of 0.45  mg/kg in normal humans would not reach 200 nM 
(0.2 μM).1 In any event, all studies suggest t hat chronic activation of the 5 -HT 2B is 
necessary in order to invoke cardiac valvulopathy, and with a single administration there 
should be no concern for t hat effect.  With the EC 50 reported by Rickli et al .,24 even 
multiple administrations of psilocin would  not be expected to be harmful.  The 
valvulopat hy induced by Fen -phen, or ergoline type anti -Parkinson agents, involved daily 
administration of the drugs over a s ignificant period of time. Thus, there is no expectation 
that single use of psilocybin will be problematic.  
1.2.3  Clinical Adverse Event Profile  
The use of psilocybin in psychotherapy have been reported since the 1960s , but these 
studies suffer from a lack of experimental control and standardised assessments. Owing 
to the absence of adequate control groups, and use of follow -up measurements with 
vague criteria for therapeutic outcomes, the studies do not clearly distinguish between the 
drug or the therapeutic engagement itself that produced the reported beneficial effect.  
The safety of psilocybin should be considered in terms of benefit and risk.  Within the 
context of psilocybin administration in a controlled setting, a participant  may report 
visual or auditory disturbances, feelings of unreality, altered sense of time, and other 
changes in mood or affect amongst other neuropsychiatric observations w hich have been 
previously described (see  Table 4.1 of the current Psilocybin IB).7 These effects are both 
expected, and may be a necessary component of therapeutic response. Investigators must 
follow regulatory guidance under 21 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR ) 312.32(a) for 
AE reporting which addresses untoward medical occurrences associated with the use of a 
drug in humans, whether or not considered  drug related. An AE can be any unfavourable  
and unintended sign (eg , an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom or disease temporally 
associated with the use of a drug, without any judgment about causality.  
1.2.4  Potential Risk to Foetal  Development  
Reproductive toxicology studies have not been performed to establish risk to the fetus ; 
however, the results of Ames test, the human lymphocyte micronucleus assay and the 
in vivo rat micronucleus study clearly indicate no potential for genotoxicity with 
psilocybin. I t is recommended to prevent or eliminate such risk, if any, women should not 
be pregnant or nursing  and should be using an effective method of birth control when 
using psilocybin.   
1.2.5  Dosing Regimen  
Carhart -Harris  successfully evaluated two oral do ses of psilocybin ( 10 mg and 25  mg) 
administered 7 days apart to patients with unipolar TRD; minimal AEs were reported in 
this study.3 Work by the Griffiths group showed that under supportive conditions,

    psilocybin at doses of 20  to 30 mg/70 kg can dose -dependently occasion mystical -type 
experiences.11

    4 STUDY PLAN  
4.1 Study Design  
This is a Phase IIb, international multi center , fixed -dose, open -label study . The study 
population will include adult men and women, 18 years of age  or older , with TRD. 
Participants with TRD are defined as those who meet the Diagnostic and Statistical 
Manu al of Mental Disorders (5th Edition; DSM -5) diagnostic criteria for single or 
recurrent episode of major depressive disorder (MDD) without psychotic features which 
have failed to respond to an adequate dose and duration of 2, 3, or 4 pharmacological 
treatm ents for the current episode; the duration of the current episode must be at least 
3 months but not more than 2 years.  
Participants will be outpatients and will be recruited primarily through referrals from 
general practitioners and specialised psychiatric services.  
After signing the informed consent form (ICF), participants will be assessed for their 
eligibility with the  Mini International Neuropsych iatric Interview, Version 7.0.2  
(MINI  7.0.2), the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale ( 17-item; HAM -D-17), the 
Massachusetts General Hospital -Antidepressant Treatment History Response 
Questionnaire (MGH -ATRQ), the C -SSRS, and McL ean Screening Instrument for 
Borderline Personality Disorder  (MSI -BPD) . At the initial Screening visit (V1), the 
participant will als o be evaluated with the QIDS -SR-16. Additionally, a medical history, 
an ECG, blood tests , and vital signs will be obtained.   
Once a participant  completes all Screening ( V1) assessments and all screening data is 
entered into the Electronic Data Capture (EDC), the Medical Monitor (MM) and Clinical 
Assessment Technologies Team (CAT) will review data entered and issue approval, if  the 
participant  is eligible.  
All participants will be evaluated for safety  at the clinic  weekly for a minimum of 
3 weeks prior to psilocybin administration . Any safety assessment visits during the 
screening period will be called V1a, V1b, etc. During these visits, the C-SSRS  and any 
changes in medications since the previous visit will be obtained in addition to other 
assessments at the study clinician’s discretion.  
The participant will meet with a therapist for a minimum of 3 visits during screening. 
These are called safety sessions and will cover what to expect during the psilocybin 
session. The therapist and the participant will review psychoeducational materials 
provided at the time of enrolment.  
The day be fore the psilocybin session (≥ 24 h after Screening [V1]; V2, Day -1), the 
participants will undergo a baseline assessment that will consist of the HAM -D-17, 
MADRS, CGI-S, QIDS -SR-16, C -SSRS, GAD -7, EQ -5D-3L (administered to both 
participant and caregiver [the latter is not mandatory]), MARS -5, vital signs, urinalysis, 
urine drug screen, and urine pregnancy test (only for women of childbearing potential).

 Version 1.0 – Final – 11 Sep 2019   
    After baseline data is entered into EDC, the CAT team will complete a final review to 
ensure the partic ipant’s continued eligibility. Participants cannot be progressed to V3 
until this approval is received.  
The psilocybin administration session (V3, Day  0) will last approximately 6 h and will be 
under  trained therapist  supervision and support . The study dru g will be administered 
simultaneously to up to six participants. Blood pressure will be monitored continuously 
during the session. The psilocybin session may be video recorded for training and 
adherence monitoring. A full description of the activities of t he psilocybin administration 
session is found in the Therapist Manual. After the acute effects of the psilocybin pass, 
participants will be evaluated for safe ty and accompanied home. On Day  1 (V4), the day 
following psilocybin administration, participants will be seen in person for a safety 
check, assessment of suicidality, and to discuss their experience during the psilocybin 
session. All sessions between the therapist and the participant may be audio recorded for 
adherence monitoring and quality assurance . Audio and video recording of the sessions 
are subject to participant consent. Participants who do not consent to either or all 
recordings will not be excluded from the study.  
Twenty  participants will receive one dose of 25 mg psilocybin.  
Participants will be seen at the clinic for Screening (V1 , plus a minimum of 3 safety 
visits ), Baseline (V2, Day -1), Day 0 (V3, Dosing), Day 1 (V4), Week 1 (V5), Week 2 
(V6) and Week 3 (V7). Adverse events, serious adverse events (SAEs) and concomitant 
medication will be recorded at all clinic visits. The MADRS will be done by telephone 
and the other assessments will be done electronically.   
Clinicians are advised to continue the prescription of the participant’s baseline SSRI 
(fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, sert raline, paroxetine, citalopram or escitalopram ) for the 
duration of the follow -up period, ideally at the same dose.  
The study schem atic is presented in Section 4.2 and the schedule of assessments is 
presented in Section 4.3.

Once a participant  completes all Screening ( V1) assessments and all screening data is 
entered into the EDC, the MM and CAT will review data entered and issue approval, if 
the participant  is eligible.  
Before the participant progresses further in the screening period (ie, before they attend 
Visit 1a), the PI will receive 2 email notifications, 1 from the MM and 1 from the CAT 
group, to confirm eligibility. Once these notifications are received (and the participant is 
deemed eligible), the participant can proceed to the next visit (V1a). Patients cannot 
begin psychoeducation or tapering off their antidepressant medication until they attend 
the clinic for the screening visit V1a.  
At subsequent scr eening period visits (V1a, V1b), medications taken and any changes in 
medications since the previous visit, and the C -SSRS  will be obtained . 
6.2.2  Baseline Visit – Visit 2  – Day -1 
The Baseline visit ( V2, Day  -1) should occur after Screening (V1)  + < 7-Day window.  At 
the Baseline visit  (V2, Day  -1), the participant’s eligibility will be confirmed  by 
reviewing the Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria (Sections 5.2 and 5.3) and updating the 
medical history . If the participant is out of the <  7-Day window, all bas eline assessments 
are to be repeated. The B aseline visit (V2, Day  -1) should occur the  day before the

6.3 Premature Discontinuation  
If the participant ’s participation in the study is terminated prematurely for any reason, the 
reason for such ET should be documented and the V 7 (EOS ) procedures should be 
performed  as noted in Section  6.2.6 . 
A termination electronic Case Report Form (eCRF) page should be completed for every 
participant  who is enrolled , whether the participant  completes the study or not.  The 
reason for any ET should be indicated on this form; as much information should be 
provided as possible.  The primary reason for a participant  discontinuing early should be 
selected from the following standard categories of E T: 
• Screen Failure: Participant  does not qualify to participate in the study.  
• Lack of efficacy  
• Adverse Event : Clinical or laboratory events occurred that, in the medical judgment of 
the investigator for the best interest of the participant , are grounds for discontinuation.  
This includes serious and nonserious AEs regardless of relation to the IP.  
• Death: The participant  died.  
• Withdrawal of Consent : The participant  desired to withdraw from further 
participation in the study in the absence of an investigator -determined medical need 
to withdraw.  If the participant  gave a reason for withdrawing, it should be recorded in 
the eCRF.  
• Protocol Violation : The participant ’s findings or conduct failed to meet the protocol 
entry criteria or failed to adhere to the protocol requirements (eg, drug 
noncompliance, failure to return for defined number of visits).  The violation 
necessitated early discontinued from the study.  
• Lost to Follow -Up: The participant  stopped coming for visits and study personnel 
were unable to contact the participant . 
• Non-compliance:  The participant  was non -compliant with study visits or proced ures.

    7 DESCRIPTION OF STUDY  PROCEDURES  
7.1 Efficacy Assessments  
All measures below will be captured electronically.  
7.1.1  Montgomery -Asberg Depression Rating Scale  
MADRS evaluations will be performed by an independent remote rater  at Baseline  
(Day  -1), Day 1 and Weeks 1, 2 and 3 (V2, V4, V5, V6 and V7, respectively) . The 
MADRS is a clinician -rated scale measuring depression severity, co nsisting of 10 items, 
each scored from 0 (normal) to 6  (severe), for a total possible score of 60; higher scores 
denote greater severity.21 The structure of the telephone -based interview will be 
controlled through the use of The Structured Inter view Guide for the MADRS 
(SIGMA ),34 which  provides structured probes to ensure standardi sation of administration 
and comprehensive coverage of 10  questions.  
7.1.2  Clinical Global Impression – Severity Scale 
The CGI -S is a 7 -point scale that measures the severity of symptoms in patients with 
mental diso rders .2,12 It requires the clinician to rate the severity of the patient's illness at 
the time of assessment, relative to the clinician's past experience with patients who have 
the same diagnosis. Rating s range from “normal, not at all ill ” (1) to “among the most 
extremely ill patients ” (7). This will be obtained at  Baseline  (Day  -1), Day 1, and 
Weeks  1, 2 and 3 (V2, V4, V5, V6 and V 7, respectively) . 
7.1.3  Clinical Global Impression – Improvement  Scale  
The CGI -I is a 7 -point scale that requires the clinician to rate how much the patient’s 
symptoms have improved relative to a baseline state.2,12 Ratings range from “very much 
improved” (1) to “very much worse” (7). This will be obtained at Day 1 and Weeks  1, 2 
and 3 (V4, V5, V6, and V7, respectively).  
7.1.4  Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology  – Self Rated – 
16 Item 
The 16-item QIDS is a self -rated scale designed to assess the severity of depressive 
symptoms in the nine diagnostic symptom domains of  a major depressive episodes, 
exclusive of atypical or melancholic symptoms.25 The QIDS -SR-16 is sensitive to change 
with various treatments, demonstrating its utili ty in research settings. The total score 
ranges from 0 to 27 with 0 representing no depression and 27 representing severe 
depression. The total score is the sum of the nine symptom domains. The QIDS -SR-16 
will be collected at every clinic visit or contact with the participant.

 Version 1.0 – Final – 11 Sep 2019   
    7.1.5  Generali sed Anxiety Disorder Scale 
The GAD -7 is useful in primary care and mental health settings as a screening tool and 
symptom severity measure for the seven most common anxiety disorders.27 Participant s 
choose one of four severity scores associated  with problems related to the common 
anxiety disorders and then indicate s the degree to which these problems caused funct ional 
and/or social difficulties. Scores are determined by calculating the values for each 
column. A total score is obtained by the sum of all total column values  with a maximum 
score of 21 . The GAD -7 will be obtained using the  electronic patient -reported outcome  
(ePRO ) device at Baseline  (Day  -1), Day 1 and Weeks 1, 2 and 3 (V2, V4, V5, V6 and 
V7, respectively) .  
7.1.6  EuroQoL-5-dimension 3-level Scale  
The 3-level EQ -5D version (EQ ‑5D‑3L) was introduced by the EuroQoL Group in 
1990.18,29 The EQ -5D-3L essentially consists  of two sections : the EQ -5D-3L descriptive 
system and the EQ visual analogue scale (EQ VAS).   
The descriptive system comprises five dimensions: mobility, self -care, usual activities, 
pain/discomfort , and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has three  levels: no problems, 
some  problems and extreme problems. The participant is asked to indicate his/her health 
state by ticking the box next to the most appropriate statement in each of the five 
dimensions. T his decision results in a 1 -digit number that expresses the level selected for 
that dimension. The digits for the five dimensions can be combined into a 5 -digit number 
that describes the participant’s health state.  
The EQ VAS records the participant’s self -rated health on a vertical visual analog scale 
(VAS ), where the endpoints are labelled ‘The best imaginable health state’ and ‘The 
worst imaginable health state’. The VAS can be used as a quantitative measure of health 
outcome that reflect the participant ’s own judgement.  
The EQ -5D-3L will be obtained at Baseline  (Day -1) and Week 3 (V2 and V 7, 
respectively).  Administration to a caregiver is not mandatory.  
7.2 Safety Assessments  
7.2.1  Columbia -Suicide Severity Rating Scale  
The C -SSRS will be used to assess suicide potential or tendency as a study entry criteria 
and monitored throughout the study.  
The C -SSRS is a semi -structured interview designed to assess the severity and intensity 
of suicidal ideation, suicidal behavior, and nonsuicidal self -injurious behavior ove r a 
specified time period. The measurement of suicidal ideation is based on 5  “yes” or “no” 
questions with accompanying descriptions arranged in order of increasing severity.  If the 
participant  answers “yes” to either questions 1 or 2, the intensity of ide ation is assessed in

 Version 1.0 – Final – 11 Sep 2019   
    5 additional questions related to frequency, duration, controllability, deterrents, and 
reasons for the most severe suicidal ideation.  Suicidal behavior is assessed by asking 
questions categorizing behaviors into actual, aborted, and i nterrupted attempts; 
preparatory behavior; and nonsuicidal self -injurious behavior.  
If any item(s) on the C -SSRS are answered “yes”, the primary investigator or physician 
investigator must review the participant’s responses in order to (a) at Screening and 
Baseline determine the participant ’s study eligibility and potential need for referral to a 
mental health professional, and (b) during the study evaluate the participant’s need for 
appropriate medical management such as a referral to a mental health professional.  
A significant risk of suicide is defined as a “yes” in answer to (a) questions 4 or 5 on the 
suicidal ideation section; or (b) any questions on any item in the suicidal behavior 
section.  This must be reported as an AE or SAE  as appropr iate and followed up 
accordingly.  Additionally, if a participant responds “yes” to any of the suicidal ideation 
questions 1 through 3, the investigator should apply clinical judgment to determine the 
need for reporting this as an AE or SAE and the need for  any appropriate referral.  
The C-SSRS will be collected at every clinic visit.  
7.2.2  Vital Signs  
Respiratory rate, blood pressure, body temperature, and pulse rate will be obtained at 
Screening, Baseline  (Day  -1), Day 0, and Day 1 (V1, V2, V3, and V4, respectiv ely).  
Blood pressure will be monitored continuously throughout the psilocybin session. At all 
other clinic visits, b lood pressure will be measured supine, after at least 5 min at rest. Th e 
three measurements should be recorded 1  to 2 min apart, and the results averaged to 
inform eligibility . 
7.2.3  Electrocardiogram  
Standard 12 -lead ECGs will be obtained at Screening (V1) and Day 1  (V4). 
7.2.4  Clinical Laboratory Tests  
Blood samples will be obtained at Screening (V1), Day 1 ( V4), and Week 3 (V 7) for the 
following :  
• Haematology:  haemoglobin, haematocrit, red blood cell count, mean corpuscular 
haemoglobin, mean corpuscular volume, mean corpuscular haemoglobin 
concentration, white blood cell count (with differential), and platelet count.  
• Chemistry:  albumin, alkaline p hosphatase, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), amylase, 
aspartate aminotransferase (AST), bicarbonate, bilirubin (direct, indirect, and total), 
calcium, chloride, creatine kinase, creatinine, gamma -glutamyltransferase , glucose,

    lactate dehydrogenase, lipase, magnesium, phosphate, potassium, protein -total, 
sodium, urea (blood urea nitrogen), and uric acid.  
Urine samples will be obtained at Screening (V1), Baseline (V 2, Day  -1) and Day 1 (V4) 
for the following:   
• Urinalysis: a dipstick urinalysis will be performed for blood, glucose, ketone, protein, 
pH, specific gravity, nitrite, leukocytes, bilirubin, and urobilinogen.  
• Urin e Drug Screen : for illicit drugs or drugs of abuse at Screening (V1) and Baseline 
(V2, Day  -1). Results of a pos itive drug screen will be reviewed by the study clinic ian 
for pattern of use.  
• Urine P regnancy Test: a dipstick test in women  of childbearing potential at Screening 
(V1) and Baseline (V2 , Day  -1).  
Laboratory samples will be analysed by a c entral laboratory ( Eurofins ) to ensure 
consistent interpretation of results.  Instructions for shipment of samples and review of 
results is provided in the Laboratory Manual . In the event of an unexplained clinically 
significant abnormal laboratory test value, the test should be repeated and followed up 
until it has returned to the normal range and/or an adequate explanation of the 
abnormality is found.  
7.2.5  Adverse Events  
All AEs occurring after the participant  signs the ICF and up to the last  study event will be 
recorded. Any AEs occurring before the start of treatment (ie, before the dose of the IP on 
Day 0 [V3]) will be recorded in the medical history . Any AE ongoing at V 7 (EOS/ET) 
will be followed until resolution or no longer considered cl inically significant by the 
investigator.  
See Section s 9 and 10 for additional information.  
7.3 Other Assessment Instruments  
7.3.1  Hamilt on Depression Rating Scale – 17-item 
The HAM -D-17, a 17-item scale , is used to measure the degree of symptom severity in 
depres sed patients.13 The HAM -D-17 rating will be performed by the investigator using 
the electronic clinical outcome assessment (eCOA ) device at the Screening (V1) and 
Baseline (V2 , Day  -1) only . The total score f rom this assessment will be used as 
eligibility criteria prior to treatment (minimal total symptom score ≥  18). The Structured 
Interview Guide for the HAM -D-17 (SIGH -D) will be administered.33 This will be 
captured electronically.

    7.3.2  Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview , Version 7.0.2  
The MINI was designed as a brief structured interview for the major Axis I psychiatric 
disor ders in DSM -5 and International Classification of Diseases -10. Validation and 
reliability studies have been done comparing the MINI to the Structured Clinical 
Interview for D SM-5 Patient Edition and the Composite International Diagnostic 
Interview (a struc tured interview developed by the World Health Organization). 
Version  7.0.2 of the MINI will be used for this study. The results of these studies show 
that the MINI has similar reliability and validity properties, but can be administered in a 
much shorter period  (mean 18.7 ± 11.6 min, median 15 min) than the above referenced 
instruments. It can be used by clinicians after a brief training session.26 
At Screening (V1), participant s will be assessed for MDD, as documented by DSM -5 
criteria, and the lack of other psychiatric diagnoses will be confirmed by use of the 
MINI.26 
7.3.3  Massachusetts General Hospital -Antidepressant Treatment 
History Response Questionnaire  
The MGH -ATRQ  is a self -rated scale used to determine treatment resistance in major 
depressive disorder.5 The scale examines the efficacy (improvement from 0%, not 
improved at all to 100% completely improved ) and adequacy of a treatment. Participant s 
are asked by clinician about treatment adherence to each medication study  and examines 
the participant s’ antidepressant history to identify pseudo -resistance and treatment 
resistance. Failure to respond to an adequat e dose and duration of 2, 3, or 
4 pharmacological treatment s for the current episode , as determined through the 
MGH -ATRQ , and using the supplementary advice on additional antidepressants  are not 
included in MGH -ATRQ ( Appendix  III). Augmentation with an add on treatment counts 
as a second treatment, provided it is approved for the adjunctive treatment of MDD in 
that co untry.  In addition, a list of recently approved antidepressant medications not 
included in MGH -ATRQ will be provided to investigators. The MGH -ATRQ will be 
collected at Screening (V1)  only. This will be captured electronically . 
7.3.4  McLean Screening Instrument for Borderline Personality Disorder  
The MSI -BPD is a commonly used measure to assess for BPD.35 The scale consists of 
10 items based on the DSM -5 BPD criteria; the first eight  items represent the first eight 
criteria in the DSM -5 for BPD diagnosis, while the last two questions assess th e paranoia 
and dissociation criteria for BPD. Scores for the MSI -BPD range from 0  to 10, with each 
item rated as “1” if present and “0” if absent. A score of 7 or higher indicates a likelihood 
for the participant  to meet criteria for BPD.  The MSI-BPD  will be collected at Screening 
(V1)  only.  This will be captured electronically .

    7.3.5  Five Dimension Altered States of Consciousness Questionnaire  
The 5D -ASC measures the acute drug effects  using five primary dimensions and 
respective subdimensions to assess alterations in mood, perception, and experience of self 
in relation to environment and thought disorder. The five dimensions include : oceanic 
boundlessness , anxious ego dissolution , visionary restru cturalization , auditory alterations , 
and reduction of vigilanc e.8,9,28 This will be administered immediately after the 
psilocybin session on Day 0 (V3). This will be captured electronically . 
7.3.6  The Positive and Negative Affect Schedule  
The PANAS measures the acute emotional drug effects , and  compri ses two mood scales 
that measure positive and negative affect.32 Participants  respond to 20 items using a 
5-point scale that ranges from “slightly or not at all (1)” to “extremely (5)”. A total higher 
score on the positive affect questions indicates more o f a positive affect while a lower 
score on the negative affect questions indicates less of a negative affect. This will be 
administered at Baseline (V2 , Day -1) and the day after the psilocybin session (V 4) This 
will be captured electronically . 
7.3.7  Medication Adherence Report Scale  
The MARS -5 is a 5 -item self -report scale of medication adherence.6,19 Participants 
respond to five statements regarding how often they engage in non -adherent behavior s in 
relation to their SSRI medication on a 5 point Likert  scale ( from “always” to “never”). 
The item scores are summed to indi cate overall level of adherence. This will be 
administered at Baseline (V2 , Day -1) and Weeks 1, 2 and 3  (V5, V6 and V 7, 
respectively).  
7.4 Protocol Deviations  
All protocol deviations will be assessed and documented on a case -by-case basis before 
the database lock, and deviations considered  as having a serious impact on the efficacy 
results will lead to the relevant participant  being excluded from the analysis.  
Protocol deviations will be summari sed by sites and grouped into different categories, as 
follows:  
o those who entered the study even though they did not satisfy the entry criteria;  
o those who developed withdrawal  criteria during the study but were not 
withdrawn;  
o those who received the wrong treatment or incorrect dose ; 
o those who took any prohibited medications during the study.

 Version 1.0 – Final – 11 Sep 2019   
    8.3 Dose and Administration  
Study drug will be administered simultaneously to up to six participants.  
Each participant  will receive 1 x  25 mg treatment bottle containing 5  x 5 mg capsules . 
After a light breakfast taken  at least  2 h prior to dosing and u nder observation of study 
staff, t he 5-capsule dose is to be swallowed with a full glass of water ; due to the number 
of capsules in a dose, additional water will be provided as  necessary to swallow the dose . 
Study staff will ensure the entire 5 -capsule dose has been swallowed .  
To prepare for the drug experience, the participant  will take the IP and lie down  on a 
couch or bed in a room with dim lights and  a standard playlist of  relaxing music playing 
quietly. The trained therapist  will be present with the participant at all times.  
The effects of psilocybin usually start about 20 to 30 min after administration , becoming 
most intense in the first 90 to 120 min , and gradually subside in 5 to 6 h. The participant s 
will be asked to remain in the room for the duration of the session regardless of the 
intensity of the effects, prefreably lying down and mostly silent unless they have a 
concern  or need to communicate a discomfort or seek reassurance from the therapist, or 
use the restroom. The therapist will ‘ check -in’ with the participant (ie, ask how the 
participant is doing) in 30 to 60 min intervals postdosing. A li ght meal and fruit will be 
available for the participant.  
About 5  to 6 h after dosing, a trained therapist  will discuss the IP administration 
experience with the participant. The participant is to be discharge d 6 to 8 h postdosing 
when, in the opinion of the investigator, the acute effects of psilocybin are resolved. The 
participant will then be accompanied  home. The site is to be notified that they have 
return ed home safely, and in the absence of receiving a phone call , site staff will directly 
contact the participant.  
8.4 Accountability  
The investigator must keep an accurate account of the number of IP units del ivered to the 
site, administered  to participant s, and returned to the sponsor  or its designee during and at 
the completion of the study. The IP must be administered  to participant s only by an 
appropriately qualified person. The IP is to be used in accordan ce with the protocol by 
participant s who are under the direct supervision of the investigator. Investigators should 
maintain records that document adequately that the participant s were administered the IP 
dose specified by the protocol and reconcile all IPs received at the site before final 
disposition. At the end of the study, or as directed, all IP, including unused, partially 
used, and empty containers, will be returned to the sponsor or its designee.

    8.5 Concom itant Therapy  
All prescription and nonprescription medications (eg, over -the-counter  [OTC]  drugs and 
herbal supplements) that participant s report taking during the 30  days prior to Screening 
(V1) will be assessed and recorded at that visit. For each medica tion, documentation 
should list the trade or generic name, the total daily dose including units (or the dose, 
units and scheduled and actual frequency of administration if the medication is not taken 
daily), the route of administration, and the reason for use.  
Concomitant medication refers to all drugs and therapies used from the time the ICF was 
signed through the end of study participation .  
Changes, additions, or discontinuations to medications and therapies will be assessed and 
recorded in the eCRF dur ing each study visit. All as -needed ( pro re nata , PRN) 
prescriptions should be converted to reflect actual number of pills or dose taken per day.  
8.5.1  Permissible Medications  
Participants must have been r eceiving treatment with a SSRI  (fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, 
sertraline, paroxetine, citalopram or escitalopram ) at an adequate dose  according to local 
recommendations  for at least 6  weeks before Screening (V1) and Baseline (V2 , Day  -1). 
Dose changes within the adequate range are acceptable. We recommen d that the 
participant is continued on the SSRI for the duration of the follow -up period of the study, 
ideally at the same dose.  
Medications for the management of concurrent anxiety and insomnia, or nonpsychiatric 
medications that have a potential psychot ropic effect are permitted within the following 
limitations. From the initial Screen Visit (V1) through final study visit  (V7, EOS) , 
participant s are permitted to use benzodiazepines (up to 2 mg of lorazepam equivalents 
per day ) for insomnia and anxiety if it is not taken within 12 h before the psilocybin dose. 
Prescription and nonprescription medications with psychoactive properties that are used 
as needed for  nonpsychiatric conditions (eg,  pseudoephedrine for allergies or cold 
symptoms ; zopiclone for sleep disorders ) should be used no more than two times a week 
and not in the 12 h before any study assessment. Documentation of the use of adjunctive 
anxiolytics, hypnotics or medication with potential psychotropic properties (inclu ding 
OTC  preparations) will be obtained at each clinic visit.  
Therapy considered necessary for the participant ’s welfare may be given at the discretion 
of the study clinician . If the permissibility of a specific medication/treatment is in 
question, please contact the sponsor  or its designee.

    8.5.2  Definition of Women  of Childbearing Potential and/or Acceptable 
Contraceptive Methods  
A woman is considered of childbearing potential (ie, fertile) following menarche and 
until becoming postmenopasusal unless permanently sterilised (ie, participant had 
hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy, or bilateral oophorectomy).  
A woman  who is not of childbearing potential is considered to be postmenopausal after at 
least 12 months without menstruation .  
The following methods of contraception, if used properly  and used for the duration of the 
study , are generally considered highly effective :  
o Combi ned estrogen - and progestogen -containing hormonal contraception 
associated with inhibition of ovulation:  
▪ Oral 
▪ Intravaginal  
▪ Transdermal  
o Progestogen -only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation:  
▪ Oral  
▪ Injectable  
▪ Implantable  
o Intrauterin e devise  
o Intrauterine hormone -releasing system  
o Bilateral tubal occlusion  
o Vasectomised partner  
o Sexual abstinence  
Periodic abstinence (ie, calendar, symptother mal, or postovulation methods, and tubal 
ligation/occlusion) is not an acceptable form of contraception for this study.   
These methods of contraception also apply to partners of male participants.

Psilocybin  Page 48 of 80 
 
 
   
 Version 1.0 – Final – 11 Sep 2019   
    The investigator and each participant  will determine the appropriate method of 
contraception for the participant  during t he participation in the study.  This will be 
documented at Screening (V1).  
If a participant  or the partner of a male participant becomes pregnant during the study, the 
investigator will notify the sponsor  or Worldwide  immediately after the pregnancy is 
confirmed  according to Section  12.5.  
8.5.3  Prohibited Medications  
Participants are to be discontinued from antidepressant and/or antipsychotic medications , 
except the participants SSRI ( fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, sertraline, paroxetine, citalopram 
or escitalopram ), at least 2 weeks prior to Baseline (V2 , Day -1). These medications 
include the following two classes of the Anatomical Therapeutic Chem ical (ATC) 
Classification System: NO5A Antipsychotics & NO6A Antidepressants. Methylphenidate  
(ATC Classification System: NO6B Psychostimulants)  is also excluded.  
The MM should be contacted if there is any question that a used medication is thought to 
be in one of these classes. These medications are not to be reintroduced to the participant 
until after V7 (Week 3). Participants who require concomitant medication(s) specifically 
for the treatment of depression at any time  through the duration  of the  study w ill be 
assessed for reasons of resuming their medications and followed until 12 weeks post 
psilocybin administration. The study clinician should initiate treatment of symptoms of 
depression per local site practice and may change the venue of therapy (ie, o utpatient to 
inpatient) if deemed clinically necessary. The intervention may be a combination of 
somatic (eg , approved antidepressant medication) and nonsomatic (various forms 
psychotherapy, eg , cognitive behavior al therapy  whose therapeutic intention is 
remediation of the depressive episode.  
Because the anticipated half -life of psilocybin is approximately 3 h, and only 
one administration of test product is permitted, no known issues regarding 
pharmacokinetic  or pharmacodynamic interactions are envisioned within approximately 
7 days of product administration.  
8.5.4  Rescue Medication  
Rescue  medications may be used during and after the psilocybin session.  
The decision to medicate a participant  will depend on whether the monitors and 
responsible physician judge that they are capable of maintaining the safety of the 
participant  and others without medical intervention.  
• Benzodiazep ine anxiolytics is the pharmacological intervention of choice in case of 
acute psychological distress (eg, medications such as lorazepam or alprazolam that 
have a rapid onset, a short time until peak plasma concentration, and a short duration

 Version 1.0 – Final – 11 Sep 2019   
    of therapeuti c action; the oral route is preferable because  intravenous  (IV) injection 
procedures may further exacerbate the participant’s anxiety).  
• Antipsychotic medications (eg, risperidone) should be available in the event that an 
adverse reaction escalates to unman ageable psychosis.  
In case of development of acute anxiety or psychotic symptoms requiring 
pharmacological intervention, the participant will be managed appropriately. Rescue 
medication  should be administered according to their respective approved prescri bing 
information and dose levels. The participant may be discharged from the clinic  when, in 
the opinion of investigator, the condition has stabilized. The participant will be  
accompanied home . The site is to be notified by the participant that they have returned 
home safely, and in the absence of receiving a phone call site staff will directly contact 
the participant.  
Information for  how to manage participants during difficult psychological sta tes are 
detailed in the Therapist  Manual.  
8.6 Compliance  
Administration of IP will be supervised by study personnel to ensure compliance.

    9 ADVERSE EVENTS  
Throughout the course of the study, all AEs will be monitored and recorded on an AE 
eCRF, including the A E’s description, start and end date, seriousness, severity, action 
taken, and relationship to the IP. If AEs occur, the first concern will be the safety of the 
study participant s.  
Per International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for 
Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) E2A: An AE is any untoward medical occurrence 
in a participant  or clinical investigation participant  administered a pharmaceutical product 
and which d oes not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment.  An 
AE can therefore be any unfavourable  and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use 
of a med icinal product, whether  considered related to the medicinal product.  
Medical interventions such as surgeries, diagnostic procedures, and therapeutic 
procedures are not AEs but the action taken to treat the medical condition.  They should 
be recorded as trea tment of the AEs.  
The investigator will promptly notify the sponsor  or Worldwide  of all SAEs and 
nonserious AEs occurring during the clinical study  so that legal obligations and ethical 
responsibiliti es towards the safety of participant s and the safety of the product under 
clinical investigation are met.  
The sponsor  or Worldwide  has a legal responsib ility to notify both the local regulatory 
authority and other regulatory a gencies about the safety of a product under clini cal 
investigation. The sponsor  or Worldwide  will comply with country -specific regulatory 
requirements relat ing to safety reporting to the regulatory a uthority, Institutional Review 
Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) , and investigators. These wi ll be 
detailed in the safety plan.  
9.1 Documenting Adverse Events  
AEs occurring from when the participant  signs the ICF until the last study event will be 
recorded.  Any AEs occurring before the start of treatment (ie, before the dose of the IP on 
Day 0 [V3] ) will be recorded in the medical history.  Also, the sign, symptom, or disease 
present before starting the treatment period are only considered AEs if they worsen after 
starting the treatment period.  Investigators should document all significant illnesses tha t 
the participant  has experienced  within 3  months of the Screening v isit. Additional 
illnesses present at the time informed consent is given are to be regarded as concomitant 
illnesses. Illnesses first occurring or detected during the study and/or worsenin g of a 
concomitant illness during the study are to be documented as AEs on the eCRF.  
All clinical laboratory results, vital signs, and ECG results or findings should be 
appraised by the investigator to determine their clinical significance.  Isolated abnormal 
clinical laboratory test results, vital sign findings, or ECG findings (ie, not part of a 
Protocol   
Study Number COMP00 3 – Psilocybin for TRD ( P-TRD)  Confidential  
Psilocybin  Page 51 of 80 
 
 
   
 Version 1.0 – Final – 11 Sep 2019   
    reported diagnosis) should be reported as AEs if they are symptomatic, lead to IP 
discontinuation, require corrective treatment, or constitute an AE  in the investigator’s 
clinical judgment.  
At each time point, the investigator will determine whether any AEs have occurred by 
evaluating the participant . AEs may be directly observed, reported spontaneously by the 
participant  or by questioning the partici pant at each time point.  Participant s should be 
questioned in a general way, without asking about the occurrence of any specific 
symptoms.  The investigator must assess all AEs to determine intensity , causality  and 
seriousness , in accordance with the defini tions in Section s 9.2, 9.3, and 10.1, 
respectively . The investigator’s assessment must be clearly documented in the study 
site’s source documentation with the investigator’s signature.   
Always report the diagnosis as the AE or S AE term.  When a diagnosis is unavailable, 
report the primary sign or symptom as the AE or SAE term with additional details 
included in the narrative until the diagnosis becomes available.  If the signs and symptoms 
are distinct and do not suggest a common d iagnosis, report them as individual entries of 
AE or SAE.  
The investigator should report all AEs on the AE page(s) of the eCRF and source 
documents, regardless of seriousness, severity, and causality.  Whenever possible, an AE 
will be reported using a diagn ostic term, (eg, “common cold” or “upper respiratory 
infection” rather than “runny nose, cough, mild fever”) and should be described with the 
attributes described in Section s 9.2 and 9.3.  
9.2 Assessment of Intensity  
Each AE will be classified according to the following criteria:  
 
Mild:  The AE does not interfere in a significant manner with the 
participant ’s normal level of functioning.  
Moderate:  The AE produces some impairment of functioning, but is not 
hazardous to the participant ’s health.  
Severe:  The AE produces significant impairment of functioning or 
incapacitation and is a definite hazard to the participant ’s 
health.  
Severity versus Seriou sness:  Severity is used to describe the intensity of a specific event 
while the event itself, however, may be of relatively minor medical significance (such as 
severe headache).  This is not the same as "seriousness," which is based on 
participant /event out come at the time of the event.

Psilocybin  Page 52 of 80 
 
 
   
 Version 1.0 – Final – 11 Sep 2019   
    When changes in the intensity of an AE occur more frequently than once a day, the 
maximum intensity for the experience should be noted.  If the intensity category changes 
over several  days, those changes should be recorded sep arately (with distinct onset dates).  
9.3 Assessment of Causality  
Each AE will be assessed as to its relationship to the IP, based on the following criteria.  
Although the attribution by the investigator will be collected for reported events, for 
analytic purposes a temporal association with the use of the IP will be assumed sufficient 
for at least plausible association.  
 
Not related:  No causal relationship exis ts between the IP and the AE, but an 
obvious alternative cause exists, e g, the participant ’s underlying 
medical condition or concomitant therapy.  
Possibly related:  A connection with the administration of the IP appears unlikely, 
but cannot be ruled out with certainty.  An AE may be 
considered possibly related if or when it meets two of the 
following criteria:  (1) it follows a reasonable temporal sequence 
from administration of the IP; (2) it could not readily hav e been 
produced by the participant ’s clinical state, environmental or 
toxic factors, or other modes of therapy administered to the 
participant ; or (3) it follows a known pattern of response to the 
IP. 
Related:  There is a reasonable/plausible possibility that the AE may have 
been caused by the IP. 
When assessing the relationship to the IP, the following criteria will be considered:  
o Known class effect  
o Biological plausibility  
o Lack of alternative explanation —concom itant drug or disease  
9.4 Action Taken Regarding Investigational Product  
Dose modifications of IP (ie, dose not changed, drug withdrawn, drug interrupted, or 
dose increased) are not applicable as this is a single dose study.  
o Not Applicable: Participant died, study treatment had been completed prior to 
reaction/event, or reaction/event occurred prior to start of treatment.

    10 SERIOUS ADVERSE EVEN TS 
10.1 Definiti on of Serious Adverse Event  
An SAE is any event that meets any of the following criteria:  
o Death  
o Life-threatening  
o Inpatient  hospitali sation or prolongation of existing hospitali sation  
o Persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
o Congenital anomaly/birth defect in the offspring of a participant  who received 
psilocybin.  
o Other:  Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, 
or require hospitali sation, may be considered an SAE when, based upon 
appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardi se the participant  and may 
require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in 
this definition. Examples of such events are:  
▪ Intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic 
bronchospasm  
▪ Blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in in patient hospitali sation  
▪ Development of drug dependency or drug abuse  
Definition of Terms  
Life-threatening: An AE is life -threatening if the participant  was at immediate risk of 
death from the event as it occurred; ie, it does not include a reaction that if it had 
occurred in a more serious form might have caused death. For example, drug -induced 
hepatitis that resolved without evidence of hepatic failure would not be considered 
life-threatening even though drug -induced hepatitis can be fatal.  
Hospitalis ation: AEs requiring hospitali sation should be considered SAEs. 
Hospitalis ation for elective surgery or routine clinical procedures that are not the result of 
AEs (eg, elective surgery for a pre -existing condition that has not worsened) need not be 
considered AEs or SAEs. If anything  untoward is reported during the procedure, that 
occurrence must be reported as an AE, either 'serious' or 'nonserious' according to the 
usual criteria.  
In general, hospitali sation signifies that the participant  has been detained (usually 
involving at least one an overnight stay) at the hospital or emergency ward for 
Protocol   
Study Number COMP00 3 – Psilocybin for TRD ( P-TRD)  Confidential  
Psilocybin  Page 57 of 80 
 
 
   
 Version 1.0 – Final – 11 Sep 2019   
    observation and/or treatment that would not have been appropriate in the physician's 
office or  outpatient  setting. When in doubt as to whether 'hospitali sation' occurred or was 
necessary, the AE should be considered serious.  
For deaths, the underlying or immediate cause of death should always be reported as an 
SAE.  
Any serious, untoward event that may occur subsequent to the reporting period that the 
investigator assesses as related to IP should also be reported and managed as an SAE.  
The investigator should follow participant s with AEs until the event has resolved or the 
condition has stabili sed. In case of unresolved AEs, including significant abnormal 
clinical laboratory values at the end of study assessment, these events will be followed 
until resolution or until they become clinically not relevant.  
Disability/incapacitating: An AE is incapacit ating or disabling if the experience results in 
a substantial and/or permanent disruption of the participant 's ability to carry out normal 
life functions.  
10.2 Reporting Serious Adverse Events  
Each AE will be assessed to determine whether it meets seriousness c riteria 
(Section  10.1). If the AE is considered serious, the investigator should report this event to 
Worldwide  and to the IRB/IEC according to its  standard operating procedures.  
If the investigator detects an SAE in a study participant  after the last scheduled follow -up 
visit, and considers the SAE related or possibly related to this study ’s IP administration , 
the investigator should report it to Worldwide . 
The investigator must report to the sponsor all SAEs on the eCRF page within 24 h of 
learning about the event regardless of relationship to IP.  
All information about SAEs will be collected and reported via the SAE form and sent by 
email message or facsimile (contact information will be conta ined in the investigator site 
file).  The investigator should send the initial report within 24 h of becoming aware of the 
SAE.  At minimum, the initial report should include the following information:  
o Event  
o Study code  
o Participant  identification number, init ials, and date of birth  
o IP 
o Reporter name and contact information

    If the site experiences a temporary disruption of the eCRF system, a back -up paper SAE 
Report Form will be available for site staff to complete.  
• Site staff will complete the paper SAE report form and email it within 24 h to the 
following address: drugsafety@worldwide.com  
• In cases where the email system is unavailable, site staff will send the SAE by fax 
to: +1 -866-387-5539 (US) and +44 208 043 4813 (ROW).  
If notification is made via email or f ax, site staff must enter the SAE information into the 
eCRF  system as soon as the system becomes available. Should a back -up SAE form be 
used, the original SAE form should be kept at the study site.  
If the SAE has not resolved at the time the investigator submits an initial SAE report, the 
investigator must provide a follow -up report as soon as the event resolves (or upon 
receipt of significant information if the event is still ongoing). Additional fo llow-up 
information must be reported in the eCRF within 24 h of awareness following 
investigator (or site) awareness of the information. The investigator should not delay 
reporting an SAE in order to obtain additional information. Additional information, w hen 
available, should be reported per the reporting procedures described above.  
All SAEs shall be followed until resolution, until the condition stabili ses, or until the 
participant  is lost to follow -up, or otherwise explained. Once the SAE is resolved, th e 
corresponding AE eCRF page shall be updated. Additionally, any relevant laboratory test 
reports, consultation reports from other health care professionals, discharge summaries, 
or other information that has been gathered about the event shall be transmit ted to the 
sponsor.  
In the case of a “minimum report” (one that solely comprises the information bulleted 
above), a more detailed follow -up report should be sent as soon as more information 
becomes available but no later than 7 calendar days after the dat e of the initial report.  
Each SAE should be followed up until resolution or stabili sation and for reported deaths, 
the investigator should supply Worldwide  and the IRB/IEC with any additional requested 
information (eg, autopsy reports and terminal medical reports).  
The original SAE form should be kept at the study site.  The sponsor or its representative 
will be responsible for determining and in turn, reporting SAEs to regulatory authorities 
according to the applicable regulatory requirements.  
All SAEs will  be followed until resolved or stable and the outcome documented on the 
eCRF.  
Investigator safety reports will be  prepared for suspected unexpected serious adverse 
reactions (those not listed in the IB) according to local regulatory requirements and the 
sponsor /Worldwide policy and are forwarded to investigators as necessary.

    11 STATISTICS  
11.1 General Procedures  
The statistical analysis will be undertaken by Worldwide in collaboration with the 
sponsor . A detailed Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) will be finali sed and signed before 
database lock.  Any deviations from the analyses described below will  be included in the 
SAP, which will be included in the clinical study report . 
11.2 Sample Size  
No formal sample size calculations were performed for this study. Approximately 
20 participants are expected to be enrolled in the study.  
11.3 Statistical Methods  
The Safety Population will consist of all  enroll ed participants, regardless of whether or 
not treated.  This population will be used for all summaries of participant accountability, 
demographic and baseline data, and safety information, including AE incidence.   
The Full Analysis Set (FAS) will consist of all enrolled participants who also receive the 
dose of IP. 
The Per Protocol (PP) population will consist of all participants in the FAS who do not 
have a major protocol deviation  defined as a deviation which may  significantly affect 
efficacy for that participant.  Major protocol deviations will be reviewed and determined 
prior to database lock.

    11.3.2  Analysis of Efficacy  
Since this is a single treatment open -label study, no statistical testing will be performed. 
The FAS and the PP populations will both be used for each secondary endpoint, if the 
two sets are not identical. For each of the secondary endpoints ( MADRS, CGI -S, 
C-SSRS ), measuring change from Baseline to Week 3, summary statistics will be 
provided.  
Analysis of exploratory endpoints will be detailed in the SAP.  
11.3.3  Multiplicity  
Not applicable.  
11.3.4  Analysis of Safety  
Safety data will be presented for  the Safety Population. Safety will be evaluated based  on 
AEs, ECGs , clinical laboratory tests, vital signs  and suicidal ideation/ behavior  (measured 
using C -SSRS).  
11.3.4.1  Columbia -Suicide Severity Rating Scale  
Item scores from the C-SSRS  for all visits , the item scores from the version assessing 
suicidality since the last visit , and  all postbaseline visits (V3 to V 7, inclusive) by 
treatment will be  tabulated. Summary statistics of suicidal ideation and suicidal behavior 
following IP administration will be  presented.  
11.3.4.2  Adverse Events  
AEs will be coded by Preferred Term (PT) using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory 
Activities (MedDRA) classification.  All reported AEs with onset or worsening after the 
administration of study medication will be included in the analysis. The incidence of AEs 
will be summarised by treatment group, and by severity and relationship to IP. Serious 
AEs and AEs leading to with drawal from the study will be tabulated.  
A treatment -emergent adverse event ( TEAE ) is defined as any AE that has an onset on or 
after the dose of IP, or any pre -existing condition that has worsened on or after the dose 
of IP.   
The incidence of TEAEs and tr eatment -related AEs will also be summari sed by 
maximum severity and most -related relationship to IP by MedDRA primary system organ 
class and PT. The summary will include the total number and percentage of participant s 
reporting an event.  In counting the number of events reported, a continuous event, ie, 
reported more than once and which did not cease, will be counted only once; 
non-continuous AEs r eported several times by the same participant  will be counted as 
multiple events.

    11.3.4.3  Electrocardiographic Data  
The ECG data will be summarised descriptively based on measures of change in each 
ECG parameter from Screening ( V1) to post -treatment  (V4). Frequenc y tabulations of the 
abnormalities will be provided. ECG variables to be analysed will include heart rate, PR 
interval, QRS interval, QT interval, and corrected QT interval using the following 
correction methods: QT corrected according to Bazett’s formula and QT corrected 
according to Fridericia’s formula.  
11.3.4.4  Laboratory Data  
Laboratory data (haematology and blood chemistry parameters) will be presented for 
each treatment group using descriptive statistics, including mean and mean change from 
baseline values at  each scheduled time point. Shift tables will display numbers of 
participant s with normal/abnormal values at Baseline versus post -treatment. The 
frequency of laboratory abnormalities will be tabulated. By -participant  data listings will 
flag laboratory valu es that are outside normal reference ranges or markedly abnormal 
findings.  
11.3.4.5  Vital Signs  
Changes from Baseline in vital signs, blood pressure (systolic and diastolic), body 
temperature, pulse  rate, and respiratory rate, will be summarised for each treatment group 
using descriptive statistics. The last measurement obtained prior to IP administration will 
serve as baseline. The percentage of participant s with values outside clinically important 
limits  will be summarised.  A listing of weight  and height  at Screening ( V1) will be 
provided.  
11.3.5  Demographic and Baseline Characteristics  
Participant  demographics and baseline characteristics will be summari sed using 
descriptive statistics, no formal statistical a nalysis tests will be performed.

    12 ETHICS AND RESPONSIB ILITIES  
12.1 Good Clinical Practice  
The study will be performed in accordance with this protocol, US investigational new 
drug (IND) regulations (21 CFR 312), ICH guidelines for Good Clinical Practice (GCP), 
the regulations on electronic records and electronic signature (21 CFR 11), and the most 
recent guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki ( Appendix  II). These guidelines are on 
file at Worldwide.  
The study will also be performed in accordance with any laws and regulations in force in 
the country in which the research is carried out.  
12.2 Steering Committee  
A Steering Committee will not be used for this study.  
12.3 Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics Committee  
Conduct of the study must be approved by an appropriately constituted IRB/IEC.  
Approval is required for the study protocol, protocol amendments, ICFs, participant  
information sheets, and advertising materials.  No IP will be shipped to a site until written 
IRB/IEC authori sation has been received by the sponsor or its representative.  
12.4 Informed Consent  
Participant s should be informed that they may withdraw from the study at any time.  They 
will receive all information that is required by local regulations and ICH guidelines.  The 
principal investigator or a designated representative will provide the sponsor or its 
representative with a copy of the IRB/IEC -approved ICF before the start of the study.  
12.5 Exposure in Utero During Clinical Studies  
Sponsor must be notified of any participant  who becomes pregnant within 30  days of 
receiving  the IP. Reporting after the follow -up visit or ET is done voluntarily by the 
investigator.  
Sponsor must be notified of any male participant  whose partner becomes pregnant within 
30 days of the participant receiving the IP . Reporting after  any follow -up visit or ET is 
done voluntarily by the investigator.  
Although pregnancy is not technically an AE, all pregnancies must be followed to 
conclusion to determine their outcome.  This information is important for both drug safety 
and public health con cerns.  It is the responsibility of the investigator, or designee, to 
report any pregnancy in a  participant or the partner of a male participant using the eCRF 
pregnancy  form  within 24 h of becoming aware of the event . Exposure in Utero (EIU)

    Reporting form . Please contact your study monitor to receive the EIU Reporting form 
upon learning of a pregnancy.  The investigator should make every effort to follow the 
participant  until completion of the pregnancy and complete the EIU Reporting form 
eCRF  with complete  pregnancy outcome information, including normal delivery and 
induced abortion.  The adverse pregnancy outcome, either serious or nonserious, should 
be reported in accordance with study procedures.  If the outcome of the pregnancy meets 
the criteria for imme diate classification as a n SAE (ie, post -partum complications, 
spontaneous or induced abortion, stillbirth, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly, 
including that in an aborted foetus ), the investigator should follow the procedures for 
reporting SAEs outlin ed in Section  10. In the event the eCRF system is unavailable, a 
back -up paper Pregnancy Reporting Form will be available for site staff to complete 
following the reporting guidelines as outlined in Section 10.2. 
For reports of pregn ancy in the partner of a male participant , the pregnancy eCRF page  
EIU form (or SAE form if associated with an adverse outcome) should be completed with 
the participant ’s identification  number, initials, and date of birth, and details regarding 
the partner  of the male participant should be entered in the narrative section.  
12.6 Records Management  
By signing this protocol, the investigator grants permission to personnel from the 
sponsor, its representatives, and appropriate regulatory authorities, for on -site monitoring 
of all appropriate study documentation, paper and electronic, as well as on -site review of 
the procedures employed in eCRF generation, where clinically appropriate.  
12.7 Source Documentation  
Note that a variety of original documents, data, and record s will be considered as source 
documents in this study . The eCRF itself is not to be used as a source document under 
any circumstances.  
12.8 Study Files and Record Retention  
The investigator must arrange for retention of study records at the site.  The nature o f the 
records and the duration of the retention period must meet the requirements of the 
relevant regulatory authority.  In addition, because this is an international study, the 
retention period must meet the requirements of the most stringent authority.  The 
investigator should take measures to prevent accidental or premature destruction of these 
documents.

    14 AMENDMENTS  
Protocol modifications, except those intended to reduce immediate risk to study 
participant s, may be made only by the sponsor . A protocol change in tended to eliminate 
an apparent immediate hazard to participant s may be implemented immediately, provided 
the IRB/IEC is notified within 5 days.  
Any permanent change to the protocol must be handled as a protocol amendment. The 
written amendment must be sub mitted to the IRB/IEC and the investigator must await 
approval before implementing the changes. The sponsor  will submit protocol 
amendments to the appropriate regulatory authorities for approval.  
If in the judgment of the IRB/IEC, the investigator, and/or the sponsor , the amendment to 
the protocol substantially changes the study design and/or increases the potential risk to 
the participant  and/or has an impact on the participant 's involvement as a study 
participant, the currently approved written ICF will r equire similar modification. In such 
cases, informed consent will be renewed for participant s enrolled in the study before 
continued participation.

 Version 1.0 – Final – 11 Sep 2019   
    A. INTRODUCTION  
The World Medical Association has developed the Declaration of Helsinki as a statement 
of ethical principles t o provide guidance to physicians and other participants in medical 
research involving human participant s. Medical research involving human participant s 
includes research on identifiable human material or identifiable data.  
It is the duty of the physician t o promote and safeguard the health of the people. The 
physician’s knowledge and conscience are dedicated to the fulfillment of this duty.  
The Declaration of Geneva of the World Medical Association binds the physician with 
the words, "The health of my participant  will be my first consideration," and the 
International Code of Medical Ethics declares that, "A physician shall act only in the 
participant 's interest when providing medical care which might have the effect of 
weakening the physical and mental condi tion of the participant ." 
Medical progress is based on research, which ultimately must rest in part on 
experimentation involving human participant s. 
In medical research on human participant s, considerations related to the well being of the 
human participant  should take precedence over the interests of science and society.  
The primary purpose of medical research involving human participant s is to improve 
prophylactic, diagnostic and therapeut ic procedures and the understanding of the etiology 
and pathogenesis of disease. Even the best -proven prophylactic, diagnostic, and 
therapeutic methods must continuously be challenged through research for their 
effectiveness, efficiency, accessibility and quality.  
In current medical practice and in medical research, most prophylactic, diagnostic and 
therapeutic procedures involve risks and burdens.  
Medical research is participant  to ethical standards that promote respect for all human 
beings and protect the ir health and rights. Some research populations are vulnerable and 
need special protection. The particular needs of the economically and medically 
disadvantaged must be recogni sed. Special attention is also required for those who cannot 
give or refuse cons ent for themselves, for those who may be participant  to giving consent 
under duress, for those who will not benefit personally from the research and for those for 
whom the research is combined with care.  
Research investigators should be aware of the ethica l, legal and regulatory requirements 
for research on human participant s in their own countries as well as applicable 
international requirements. No national ethical, legal or regulatory requirement should be 
allowed to reduce or eliminate any of the protec tions for human participant s set forth in 
this Declaration.  
B. BASIC PRINCIPLES FOR ALL MEDICAL RESEARCH  
Protocol   
Study Number COMP00 3 – Psilocybin for TRD ( P-TRD)  Confidential  
Psilocybin  Page 76 of 80 
 
 
   
 Version 1.0 – Final – 11 Sep 2019   
    It is the duty of the physician in medical research to protect the life, health, privacy, and 
dignity of the human participant . 
Medical research involv ing human participant s must conform to generally accepted 
scientific principles, be based on a thorough knowledge of the scientific literature, other 
relevant sources of information, and on adequate laboratory and, where appropriate, 
animal experimentation . 
Appropriate caution must be exercised in the conduct of research, which may affect the 
environment, and the welfare of animals used for research must be respected.  
The design and performance of each experimental procedure involving human 
participant s should be clearly formulated in an experimental protocol. This protocol 
should be submitted for consideration, comment, guidance, and where appropriate, 
approval to a sp ecially appointed ethical review committee, which must be independent 
of the investigator, the sponsor or any other kind of undue influence. This independent 
committee should be in conformity with the laws and regulations of the country in which 
the resear ch experiment is performed. The committee has the right to monitor ongoing 
studie s. The researcher has the obligation to provide monitoring information to the 
committee, especially any SAEs. The researcher should also submit to the committee, for 
review, i nformation regarding funding, sponsors, institutional affiliations, other potential 
conflicts of interest and incentives for participant s. 
The research protocol should always contain a statement of the ethical considerations 
involved and should indicate th at there is compliance with the principles enunciated in 
this Declaration.  
Medical research involving human participant s should be conducted only by scientifically 
qualified persons and under the supervision of a clinically competent medical person. The 
responsibility for the human participant  must always rest with a participant  of the 
research, even though the participant  has given consent.  
Every medical research project involving human participant s should be preceded by 
careful assessment of predictable risks and burdens in comparison with foreseeable 
benefits to the participant  or to others. This does not preclude the participation of healthy 
volunteers in medical research. The design of all studi es should be publicly available.  
Physicians should abstain from engaging in research projects involving human 
participant s unless they are confident that the risks involved have been adequately 
assessed and can be satisfactorily managed. Physicians should cease any investigation if 
the risks are found to outweigh the potential benefits or if there is conclusive proof of 
positive and beneficial results.  
Medical research involving human participant s should only be conducted if the 
importance of the objective outweighs the inherent risks and burdens to the participant . 
This is especially important when the human participant s are healthy volunteers.

Psilocybin  Page 77 of 80 
 
 
   
 Version 1.0 – Final – 11 Sep 2019   
    Medical research is only justified if there is a reasonable likelihood that the populations 
in which the research is carried out stand to benefit from the results of the research.  
The participant s must be volunteers and informed participants in the research project.  
The right of research participant s to safeguard their integrity must always be respected. 
Every precaut ion should be taken to respect the privacy of the participant , the 
confidentiality of the participant ’s information and to minimi se the impact of the study on 
the participant 's physical and mental integrity and on the personality of the participant . 
In any  research on human beings, each potential participant  must be adequately informed 
of the aims, methods, sources of funding, any possible conflicts of interest, institutional 
affiliations of the researcher, the anticipated benefits and potential risks of th e study and 
the discomfort it may entail. The participant  should be informed of the right to abstain 
from participation in the study or to withdraw consent to participate at any time without 
reprisal. After ensuring that the participant  has understood the information, the physician 
should then obtain the participant 's freely -given informed consent, preferably in writing. 
If the consent cannot be obtained in writing, the non -written consent must be formally 
documented and witnessed.  
When obtaining informed c onsent for the research project the physician should be 
particularly cautious if the participant  is in a dependent relationship with the physician or 
may consent under duress. In that case the informed consent should be obtained by a 
well-informed physicia n who is not engaged in the investigation and who is completely 
independent of this relationship.  
For a research participant  who is legally incompetent, physically or mentally incapable of 
giving consent or is a legally incompetent minor, the investigator must obtain informed 
consent from the legally authori sed representative in accordance with applicable law. 
These groups should not be included in research unless the research is necessary to 
promote the health of the population represented and this researc h cannot instead be 
performed on legally competent persons.  
When a participant  deemed legally incompetent, such as a minor child, is able to give 
assent to decisions about participation in research, the investigator must obtain that assent 
in addition to t he consent of the legally authori sed representative.  
Research on individuals from whom it is not possible to obtain consent, including proxy 
or advance consent, should be done only if the physical/mental condition that prevents 
obtaining informed consent i s a necessary characteristic of the research population. The 
specific reasons for involving research participant s with a condition that renders them 
unable to give informed consent should be stated in the experimental protocol for 
consideration and approva l of the review committee. The protocol should state that 
consent to remain in the research should be obtained as soon as possible from the 
individual or a legally authori sed surrogate.

 Version 1.0 – Final – 11 Sep 2019   
    Both authors and publishers have ethical obligations. In publication o f the results of 
research, the investigators are obliged to preserve the accuracy of the results. Negative as 
well as positive results should be published or otherwise publicly available. Sources of 
funding, institutional affiliations and any possible conf licts of interest should be declared 
in the publication. Reports of experimentation not in accordance with the principles laid 
down in this Declaration should not be accepted for publication.  
C. ADDITIONAL PRINCIPLES FOR MEDICAL RESEARCH COMBINED 
WITH MEDICAL CARE  
The physician may combine medical research with medical care, only to the extent that 
the research is justified by its potential prophylactic, diagnostic or therapeutic value. 
When medical research is combined with medical care, additional sta ndards apply to 
protect the participant s who are research participant s. 
The benefits, risks, burdens and effectiveness of a new method should be tested against 
those of the best current prophylactic, diagnostic, and therapeutic methods. This does not 
exclu de the use of placebo, or no treatment, in studies where no proven prophylactic, 
diagnostic or therapeutic method exists.  
At the conclusion of the study, every participant  entered into the study should be assured 
of access to the best -proven prophylactic, diagnostic and therapeutic methods identified 
by the study.  
The physician should fully inform the participant  which aspects of the care are related to 
the research. The refusal of a participant  to participate in a study must never interfere 
with the partic ipant -physician relationship.  
In the treatment of a participant , where proven prophylactic, diagnostic and therapeutic 
methods do not exist or have been ineffective, the physician, with informed consent from 
the participant , must be free to use unproven or  new prophylactic, diagnostic and 
therapeutic measures, if in the physician’s judgment it offers hope of saving life, 
re-establishing health or alleviating suffering. Where possible, these measures should be 
made the object of research, designed to evaluat e their safety and efficacy. In all cases, 
new information should be recorded and, where appropriate, published. The other 
relevant guidelines of this Declaration should be followed.

    19.3 Appendix  III – Massachusetts General Hospital -Antidepressant 
Treatment History Response Questionnaire  – Additional Detail 
Regarding the Assessment of Previous Antidepressant Treatment  
The Massachusetts General Hospital -Antidepressant Treatment History Response 
Questionnaire (MGH -ATRQ ) scale elicits information regarding prior antidepressant use. 
Additional drugs with regulatory approval for use in major depressive disorder in 
different coun tries are listed at the end of this document. Among these drugs are atypical 
antipsychotics approved for the treatment of major depressive disorder, as adjunctive 
treatments or as a monotherapy. The drug list may not be exhaustive.  
For a drug treatment to be considered appropriate, it must have been administered at a 
dose approved for the treatment of major depressive disorder in the country where the 
study site is located. The minimum duration of treatment must be deemed appropriate by 
the investigator, an d as a guidance, 6 to 8 weeks can often be considered as an adequate 
treatment duration.  
Some drugs are occasionally dosed based on therapeutic drug monitoring results. Prior 
use of drugs approved for major depressive disorder using therapeutic drug monito ring 
should be considered an appropriate intervention, if the concentrations are within the 
target range, irrespective of dose, and if the duration is considered adequate.  
 
Antidepressants , if administered at an adequate dose and duration, can support a 
characterisation of Treatment -Resistant Depr ession (TRD), in addition to medications 
listed in the (MGH -ATRQ).

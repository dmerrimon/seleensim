study.
Planned Sample 
Size:From  previous studies conducted with nemolizumab, inter-subject standard deviation is 
expected to be approximately 38.5%, w hich provides an inter -subject variability coefficient 
of variation (CV) for the primary PK param eters of 40%. A sample size of 96subjects per 
arm (AI or DCS) should provide a 90% power of claiming the bioequivalence between AI 
and DCS administrations within the range 80.00 to 125.00% for the primary PK parameters 
with the expected geometric mean ratio of 0.95.
Approximately 192 healthy subjects are planned to be randomized in this study.
Investigational 
Drug:Nem olizumab (CD14152) 30 mg will be provided  
 for injection for subcutaneous use only after reconstitution in a single -use, 
prefilled DCS or in a single -use, prefilled AI. Subjects will receive a60-mg dose of 
nemolizumab via 2 subcutaneous injections of 30 m g each at the baseline/Day 0 visit
Study Duration: The expected duration of each subject’s participation in the study is up to 16 weeks, 
including an up to 28-dayscreening period and a 12 -week evaluation period.

Page 18of 697 INTRODUCTION
7.1 Background
Nemolizumab, a humanized anti-human interleukin (IL)-31 receptor A (RA) monoclonal antibody , 
inhibits the binding of IL-31 to IL-31 RA and subsequent signal transduction. Transgenic mice 
overexpressing IL-31 exhibited skin lesions resembling those of atopic dermatitis ( AD) and 
scratching behavior, which could be suppressed by treatment with an anti-mouse IL-31 antibody
(Dillon 2004 ) (Grimstad 2009 ). In c ynomolgus monkeys , nemolizumab suppressed IL -31-induced 
scratching ( Oyama 2018 ). 
Nemolizumab administered subcutaneousl y is in clinical development stage for the treatment of 
AD and prurigo nodularis (PN). AD is a chronic inflammatory  skin disease estimated to occur in 
10% to 20% of the population (Weidinger 2016 )and up to 25% of children (Eichenfield 2014 ).
The disease is characterized bypruritus (itching), xerosis (skin dryness), and eczematous lesions 
whose features include erythema, infiltration/papulation, oozing with crusting, excoriations, and 
lichenification. PN is characterized by symmetrically  distributed, multiple, highl y prurit ic, 
hyperkeratotic, erosive or crusted nodules and papules (Hyde 1909 ). This leads to an impaired 
quality  of life and high burden due to severe itching, chronic skin lesions, and lack of treatment 
options (Warli ch 2015) .
The nemolizumab standard presentation used in ongoing clinical studies is single -dose, single -use 
dual-chamber syringe (DCS)  for 
injection (WFI) in 2 separate chambers with assembled finger rest. The DCS is intended for 
subcutaneous injection after reconstitution. The lyophilized nemolizumab powder is in Chamber 1 
and WFI as a reconstitution liquid is in Chamber 2 of the DCS (see Section 11.1). After 
reconstitution, each s yringe contains 61.5 mg/mL of nemolizumab to deliver a dose of 30 mg with 
nominal injection volume of 0.49 mL (for the 60 -mg dose, 2 injections using 2 DCSs are needed).
The nemolizumab pharmacokinetic (PK) profile as well as the safety  and tolerability  of 
nemolizumab were generated in previous studies using the DCS.
The nemolizumab PK profile was extensivel y assessed in subjects with AD in Phase 1, 2, and 2b 
studi es (CIM001JP, CIM003JG, and RD.03.SPR.114322) after repeated doses and in subjects with 
PN (Phase 2 study , RD.03.SPR.115828). Similar nemolizumab systemic exposure was observed in 
subjects with AD and subjects with PN when treated with the same dose (0.5 m g/kg).
Overall, PK assessments after subcutaneous injections of weight -based (0.1 to 3 mg/kg) or flat 
(10to 90 mg) doses showed a dose-proportional increase of nemolizumab serum concentrations 
after a single (mg/kg) injection and a less than proportional increase after repeated (mg/kg and flat) 
administrations. The terminal elimination half-life of nemolizumab was around 2 weeks after single 
and repeated administrations. The Investigator’s Brochure contains additional detailed information 
on nemolizumab PK .
The safety  and efficacy  data generated in the Phase 2b dose -finding study  supported the selection 
of the 30- mg dose as the treatment dose for the Phase 3 studies in AD.

Page 19of 69Two Phase 3 studies (SPR.118161 and SPR.118169) are randomized, double -blind, placeb o-
controlled, parallel- group studies in adult and adolescent subjects with moderate -to-severe AD to 
evaluate the safet y and efficacy  of nemolizumab administered concomitantly  with background 
topical therap y. Subjects who complete these studies may  be eligi ble to enter the planned Phase 3 
long-term extension study .
The Investigator’s Brochure contains additional detailed information on nemolizumab safety  and 
tolerability .
The efficacy , safet y, tolerability , PK, pharmacody namics, and immunogenicity  of nemoliz umab 
arebeing fully  characterized in the ongoing clinical program .
7.2 Study Rationale
During the course of development, nemolizumab in an auto- injector (AI)has been introduced. The 
AI is a fully disposable, single -use and single -dose injection system intend ed for subcutaneous 
injections (see Section 11.1).The AI facilitates subcutaneous injections by patients or caregivers 
and is the intended presentat ion for commercial use .
The AI is assembled around a dual-chamber cartridge, containing the same nemolizumab 
formulation as the DCS. To use information gathered from the DCS development program for 
support of a marketing authorization application with an AI, a gap analy sis was performed in 
accordance with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA )draft guidance “Bridging for Drug -
Device and Biologic- Device -Combination Products”. Further chemistry , manufacturing and 
control data will be generated based onthe information identified in the gap analy sis. In addition ,
the current PK study  will address the impact of changes in in the drug delivery  parameters between 
AI and DCS (i.e. injection depth, injection angle and i njection time )
The bridging strategy  includes thisPK study  to assess the relative bioavailability  of a subcutaneous 
dose of nemolizumab when administered with an AI in comparison to a DCS. The primary  
objective of this study  is to compare the rate (Cmax) and extent (AUC) of absorption of a single 
60-mg dose of nemolizumab administered with AI (test) versus DCS (reference) under controlled 
conditions in healthy  adult subjects .The secondary  objectives are to assess the safety  and

Page 20of 69Based on the available information on nemolizumab and the risks associated with biologic agents, 
the potential risks of one 60-mg dose of nemolizumab administered to healthy  adult subjects 
include local or s ystemic injection -related reactions and skin or non -skin infections. The following 
specific risk -minimization and safety  follow -up measures have been planned in this clinical study:
The exclusion criteria of this study  (i.e., restricting entry  of subjects with recent/current 
infections or known/suspected immunosuppression or unusually  frequent, recurrent, severe, or 
prolonged infections) will prevent non-eligible subjects from receivi ng nemolizumab. As no 
data are available in pregnant or breastfeeding women, these subjects are not eligible for this 
study . 
Subjects who have recently  received live -attenuated or non -live vaccines may be considered for 
enrollment after an appropriate time of 4 weeks has elapsed before the baseline visit. 
Vaccinations during the study  and follow -up period are not permitted, except for use of non-live 
seasonal vaccinations (e.g., influenza) , COVID -19and/or emergency vaccinations (e.g., rabies, 
tetanus) .
When considering the available data of nemolizumab and the risk-minimization approaches to be 
implemented, the benefit/risk ratio of nemolizumab is considered favorable in this study .
7.5 Dose Selection Rationale
In thisstudy , subjects will receive a 60 -mg dose of nemolizumab via 2 subcutaneous injections of 
30mg nemoliz umab. The proposed dose corresponds to the loading dose for both DCS and AI 
presentations and represents the highest strength used in Phase 3clinical studies with nemolizumab.
The extrapolation of the 60-mg dose to the 30-mg dose will be supported by the population PK 
model built with data collected in previous clinical studies with nemolizumab.

9.1 Description of Overall Study Design and Plan
This is a randomized, multicenter, open -label, single -dose, parallel- group study  in healthy  adult 
subjects aged 18 to 65 y ears to assess the relative bioavailability  of a 60 -mg subcutaneous dose of 
nemolizumab administered with AI compared to DCS, str atified b y injection site. The 60- mg dose 
will be administered as 2 successive subcutaneous injections of 30 mg (AI or DCS).
The study  duration will be up to 16weeks and consists of an up to 28-dayscreening period and a 
12-week PK evaluation period.
The screening period will evaluate subject eligibility. At baseline, approximately 192 subjects will 
be randomized 1:1 to receive 60 mg nemolizumab delivered with either AI or DCS. Subjects will 
be further randomized 1:1:1 to receive injection in 1 of 3 inject ion sites, i.e., abdomen, front upper 
thigh, or outer upper arm. Approximately  32 subjects in each delivery  group will be assigned to 
each injection site.
Subjects will receive a 60 -mg dose of nemolizumab via 2 subcutaneous injections of 30mg 
nemolizumab. Injections should be administered at the same location (i.e., abdomen, front upper 
thigh, or outer upper arm) and the same side with injection sites at least 1 inch (2.5cm) apart. Blood 
samples will be collected before and after nemolizumab administration for up to 12 weeks post-
dose for determining the complete serum PK profile of nemolizumab . 
A total of 21 blood samples will be collected, i.e., 1before and 20 after nemolizumab administration 
(i.e., pre-dose, 12 hours, 24 hours, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 , 11, 15, 22, 29, 36, 43, 50, 57, 71, and 
85days post-dose). Subjects will be confined to the study  center for 1 night, from nemolizumab 
dosing (Day  0) to the morning after nemolizumab dosing (Day  1).
Refer to Figure 2for an overview of the study  design.

9.2 Discussion of Study Design
This study  will assess the relative bioavailability  of a 60-mg subcutaneous dose of nemolizumab 
administered with AI compared to DCS, stratified by injection site, including abdomen, front upper 
thigh, or outer upper arm. Overall , a single -dose, open -label, parallel- group PK study  in healthy 
adult subjects is deemed appropriate for this purpose .
The parallel -group design of this study is considered necessar y due to the long terminal half -life of 
nemolizumab ranging from 12.6 to 16.5 days and is in line with the FDA guidance “Clinical 
Pharmacology  Data to Support a Demonstration of Biosimilarity  to a Reference Product ”
(Guideline 2016) and the corresponding European guideline (Guideline 2014 ).
In accordance with the same FDA guidance, the study  plans a single -dose administration, since 
single -dose PK studies are generally  more sensitive than stead y-state studies in assessing any 
difference in rate and extent of release of the drug substance from the drug product into the systemic 
circulation. Furthermore, in the case of nemolizumab, repeated- dose studies demonstrated a limited 
systemic accumulation over time, with median accumulation below 2, and steady -state 
concentrations reached after the loading dose. This confirms that the PK profile of nemolizumab is 
not affected by the number of administrations and can be predicted from single -dose PK 
parameters.
The choice of heathy  adult subject s is supported by the results of the Phase 1 study  CIM001JP. 
Study  CIM001JP showed that nemolizumab concentration -time profiles in AD patients and health y 
subject s shared the same shape, being described in both groups b y a one -compartment distribution 
model with linear elimination and first -order absorption. Overall, nemolizumab systemic exposure

Page 24of 69increased in a dose-dependent manner in the dose range of 0.03 to 3 mg/kg. The only observed 
difference was a 23 to 26% reduced exposure in AD patients compared with healthy  subjects. 
Owing to its low immunogenicity  potential, there are no safet y concerns associated with 
nemolizumab that will preclude investigation in healt hysubject s. In addition, the type of disease 
does not have any effect on nemolizumab PK, as similar systemic exposure and similar PK profiles 
were observed in subjects with AD (Phase 2 study  CIM003JG) and in subjects with PN (Phase 2 
study  SPR.115828) when treated with the same dose of 0.5 mg/kg .
Only  adult subjects will be enrolled in this study  as no significant impact of age was evidenced for 
the nemolizumab PK profile.
A total of 21 blood samples will be collected, i.e., 1 before and 20 after nemolizum ab administration 
(i.e., pre-dose, 12 hours, 24 hours, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 15, 22, 29, 36, 43, 50, 57, 71, and 85 
days post-dose) .PK blood sampling will be performed over a 12-week period after nemolizumab
administration to enable a reliable esti mation of nemolizumab total sy stemic exposure for both the 
AI and DCS. The sampling schedule includes frequent sampling around the expected time to 
maximum concentration (T max[5–9 day s]).
A sample size of 192 subjects, i.e., 96 subjects per arm (AI or DCS ), should provide a 90% power 
of claiming the bioequivalence between AI and DCS administration within the range of 80.00 to 
125.00% for the primary  PK parameters with the expected GMR of 0.95. This study  adopts a 
conservative approach by requiring the standard bioequivalence range of 80.00 to 125.00% to be 
met for the primary PK parameters (AUC 0-inf, , and C max) of nemolizumab.
9.3 End of Study
A subject will have fulfilled the requirements for study  completion if/when the subject has 
completed all study  proced ures as stated in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 2).
The end of the study  will be the last subject’s last visit as stated in the Schedule of Assessments 
(Table 2).

The reason(s) for withdrawal will be documented in the electronic case report form (eCRF). 
Subjects who have been enrolled and treated will not be replaced by  another subject.
When a subject discontinues the study , he/she will be assessed and followed according to the 
guidelines in Section 12.2.1 (Earl y Termination Visit).
Reasonable efforts will be made to contact subjects who are lost to follow -up. These efforts must 
be documented in the subject’s file.
The Sponsor may terminate the study  if SAEs occur or if special circumstances about the 
investigational product or the compan y itself occur, making further treatment of subjects 
impossible. The investigator(s) will be informed of the reason for study  termination.
10.4.1 Pregnancy
The safet y of nemolizumab in pregnant or lactating women has not been established. 
Subjects will be instructed that known or suspected pregnancy  during the study  should be 
confirmed and reported to the investigator. If a subject becomes pregnant, the investigator must 
withdraw the subject from the study without delay. 
The investigator must:
Follow the procedures for reporting/follow -up of a pregnancy  within 24 hours (see 
Section 14.10.5 ) of receipt of the information.
Complete as fully  as possible the Pregnancy  Surveillance Form(s) (see Section 14.10.5 ).
Monitor and record the progress of the pregnancy  until its outcome. Contact the subject’s regula r 
physician (general practitioner or gynecologist) or hospital staff to obtain further details and ask 
for regular follow -up information.
Provide tri-monthly  updates until the final outcome of the pregnancy . If the subject can no longer 
be reached (lost tofollow -up), documentation of the non-response/contact with 2 phone calls 
and a letter (certified with return receipt) is required.
If the pregnancy  leads to an abortion (i.e., voluntary  abortion, spontaneous abortion, or 
therapeutic abortion), in utero death, or congenital anomaly , follow the procedure for declaration 
of/reporting an SAE ( see Section 14.10.3 ).
The investigator should also be notified of pregnancy  during the study  (and within 12 weeks after 
the study  drugadministration ) but confirmed after completion of the study . In the event that a 
subject is pregnant after inclusion in the study , any pregnancy  will be followed to term, and the 
status of mother and child will be reported to the Sponsor after delivery .

10.4.2 Coronavirus Disease 2019
If subjects experience confirmed or suspected COVID -19infection within 2 weeks before the 
screening or baseline visits, they are not eligible for this study. Subjects may be rescreened once 
the infection has resolved. 
Resolution of COVID -19 infection can be confirmed by recovery  assessment methods, as described 
below:
For symptomatic subjects: At least 14 day s have passed since recovery, defined as resolution of 
fever without the use of fever -reducing medications and improvement in respiratory  symptoms 
(e.g.,cough, shortness of breath)
For asymptomatic subjects: At least 21 days have passed since the first positive PCR test and 
no sy mptoms
Note: The above should be considered minimum criteria. Where the local guidelines are more 
stringent for infection resolution criteria, those must be applied.
Subject sin whom COVID -19 is confirmed or suspected during the study , should follow the local 
regulations, and come back to the study  center after appropriate quarantine time and once the 
infection has resolved . COVID -19 must be specified as the reason for missed visits.
See Appendix 1 for additional guidance for management of subjects and study  conduct during the

11.5 Treatment Accountability and Compliance
Study  drug will be provided to the investigational site, and site personnel will acknowledge receipt 
of the study  drug as defined in the current version of the pharmacy  manual to confirm the shipment 
condition and content. If a damaged shipment is received and/or a temperature excursion has been 
experienced, he/she will notify  the Sponsor/CRO and follow the guidelines according to the current 
version of the pharmacy  manual.
The designated personnel will also maintain accurate records of the study  drug throughout the 
clinical study , including the inventory  delivered to the study  center, the use by each subject, the 
reconciliation of all delivered and received DCS units, and the return/destruction of unused study  
drug as specified in the current version of the pharmacy manual. No unauthorized use is permitted. 
Used AI and DCS units will be properl y documented in drug accountability  records. Unless a 
product technical complaint (PTC) is detected or an event occurs before, during, or just after the 
injection, the used AI and DCS can be disposed in an appropriate sharps container and according 
to waste regulation(s) in the country . An AI orDCS involved in a malfunction or an investigator 
or subject complaint must be retained on site and designated personnel must proceed as defined in 
the current version of the pharmacy  manual. Refer to Section 11.7 for product technical complaints.
The study  monitor willcheck the study supplies at each study  center at any time during the study . 
The study  monitor will ensure that the investigator (or designee) has correctl ydocumented the 
study  drug received, dispensed, and returned/destroy ed on the dispensing log provided. A full drug 
accountability  log will be maintained at the study  center. The study  monitor will arrange collection 
of any unused study  drug not destro yed by the site. The study  monitor will also perform an 
inventory  of study  drug at the close -out visit to the study  center. All discrepancies must be 
accounted for and documented.

Page 36of 6911.5.1 Dispensing and Return of Study Drug
All drug preparation must be appropriatel y performed and documented by the designated 
personnel. Any error to prepare dosing solution must be reported to the study  monitor promptl y 
and be properl y documented. At the end of the study , the reconciliation/return/destruction process 
for all unused study  drug will be conducted according to the sites’ standard operating procedures, 
local regulations, and best practices, as described in the current version of the pharmacy  manual. 
If the site cannot destro y drug, then the unused study  drug will be returned to the CRO/drug depot 
for destruction.
11.5.2 Compliance
Treatment compliance will be assessed through the treatment records and drug dispensation logs.
As study  drug is administered in the clinic, treatment compliance will be overseen and documented 
by the investi gator and study  staff (using the treatment records and drug accountability  records). 
At a minimum, date, time, dose, injector (site staff), and siteof injection should be accuratel y 
recorded to confirm that the single 60 -mg dose of study  drug was properly administered.
11.6 Prior and Concomitant Therapy
Prior therapies are defined as therapies stopped within the 3 months before the screening visit, 
unless relevant to the inclusion/exclusion criteria.
Concomitant therapies/medications are defined:
Any existing therapies ongoing at the time of the screening visit,
Any changes to existing therapies (such as change in dose, formulation, or application 
frequency ) during the study , or
Any new therapies received by  the subject since the screening visit.
These 2 categor ies are to be considered for prior and concomitant therapies:
Drugs/therapies include but are not limited to prescription, over-the-counter, birth control 
pills/patches/hormonal devices, vitamins, moisturizers, sunscreens, herbal 
medicines/supplements, and homeopathic preparations.
Medical and surgical procedures (e.g., phototherapy , exodontia). Procedures whose sole purpose 
is diagnosis (non -therapeutic) are not included.
Prior and concomitant therapies for drugs/therapies or for medical/surgical procedure s are to be 
recorded in the appropriate eCRF.
Concomitant therapies are to be recorded, reviewed, and updated at each visit.

The expected durati on of each subject’s participation in the study  is up to 16 weeks, including an 
up to 28-dayscreening period and a 12 -week evaluation period.
12.2.1 Early Termination Visit
Subjects who prematurely  discontinue from the study  should complete an ET visit at the time of 
discontinuation. A final visit is required 12 weeks after stud y drug administration .
12.2.2 Unscheduled Visit
The subject should be reminded to adhere to the study schedule. Unscheduled visits are defined as 
visits to repeat testing for abnormal laboratory results orfollow -up of AEs .Visits outside of the 
visit window are not considered unscheduled visits.
Assessments to be conducted at the unscheduled visit will depend on the reason for the visit: the 
procedures/assessments in Section 12.1 may be conducted, but not all are required. Blood sample 
collection for ADA analy sesisonly required during unscheduled visits conducted for safet y 
reasons, when safety  labs are collected for the management/monitoring of an AE. When 
unscheduled visits are needed for the monitoring of the same AE, ADA collection is not required 
if alread y done at the first unscheduled visit of the series. Additional collection of samples for ADA 
analysis should be performed per investigator’s judgment.

Page 45of 6914 SAFETY ASSESSMENTS
Safety  assessments will be conducted for all subjects at the screening visit (upon signing of the 
ICF) and at every  subsequent visit.
14.1 Medical History
Medical history  will be recorded at screening. Investigators should document the subject’s 
pre-existing conditions, including all prior relevant (e.g., atopic/allergic conditions such as asthma) 
and significant illnesses, before the screening visit. Medical history will include alcohol 
consumption and smoking history , if applicable. Medical history  will be coded using the most 
recent version of Medical Dictionary  for Regulatory  Activities (MedDRA).
Additionally ,demographic data will be collected for all subjects and include but are not limited to 
age, sex, race, etc., according to applicable regulations.
14.2 Vital Signs
Vital signs will be evaluated at the screening , baseline ,and  certain subsequent scheduled visits
according to Section 12.1. Vital signs will include pulse rate, s ystolic and diastolic blood pressure 
(after the subject has been sitting for at least 5 minutes), and body  temperature. All abnormal values 
at the screening visit identified as clinically  significant by the investigator will be recorde d in the 
medical history  form. Any  clinicall y significant changes from the screening visit will be recorded 
as an AE.
14.3 Physical Examination
Complete physical examination should be performed at the screening, baseline, and certain 
subsequent scheduled visits , according to Section 12.1. A complete physical examination will 
include assessments of the head, ears, eyes, nose, throat, neck (including thyroid),
skin/integumentary  system, cardiovascular system, respiratory  system, gastrointestinal system, 
musculoskeletal sy stem, ly mph nodes, nervous system, and extremities.
The investigator should assess all abnormal findings for clinical significance. All clinic ally 
significant abnormal findings at the screening visit will be recorded in the medical history  form. 
Any clinically  significant changes from the screening visit will be recorded as an AE.
14.4 Height and Weight
Height and weight will be measured, according t o Section 12.1.
Subjects must weigh at least 45 kg andhave a body  mass index between ≥ 18. 0and < 30.0 kg/m2
at both screening and baseline visits to be enrolled into this study .

Page 46of 6914.5 Electrocardiogram
A 12-lead ECG will be performed and read locally according to visits specified in Section 12.1
using the ECG machine provided. ECGs will be performed in the supine position at the time points
described in the Schedule of Assessments and before any scheduled vital sign measurements and 
blood draws. Subjects should be monitored for potentially clinicall y significant ECG results. Tests 
with abnormal results deemed clinically significant should be repeated to ensure reproducibility  of 
the abnormality. ECG abnormalities present at screening should be recorded in the medic al history 
form. Any abnormalities considered by the investigator clinically  significant after the screening 
visit are to be recorded as AEs and discussed with the medical monitor, as needed.
14.6 Clinical Laboratory Evaluation
The hematology laboratory anal yses, clinical chemistry  laboratory  anal yses, and urinaly seswill be 
performed at the clinical site. Reference ranges will be supplied by the local laboratory  and used 
by the investigator to assess the laboratory  data for clinical significance and pathologica l changes.
The investigator or medically  qualified sub-investigator must review and evaluate laboratory  values 
for each subject promptl y. For each out-of- range laboratory  result, the investigator or designee will 
evaluate whether he/she considers it clinic ally significant, defined as meeting at least 1 of these 
conditions:
The abnormalit y suggests a disease and/or organ toxicity , or
The abnormality is of a degree that requires additional active management, e.g., discontinuation 
of the drug, close observatio n, more frequent follow -up assessments, or further diagnostic 
investigation.
If the investigator observes a clinicall y significant laboratory  result, the test will be repeated soon, 
and the subject will be monitored until the value returns to normal and/or an adequate explanation 
for the abnormality  is found.
Investigators also may repeat specific laboratory test(s) or procedure(s) where the investigator 
suspects an inaccuracy  or false result and that may affect the safety  of the subject or interpreting 
thestudy  results, only  after discussion with medical monitor.
All clinically  significant out-of- range laboratory  values at the screening visit will be recorded in 
the medical history  form (report a diagnosis rather than the laboratory  value). All clinically 
significant out-of- range laboratory  values after the screening visit are to be reported as an AE if 
this abnormality  was not present at the screening visit or is assessed as having worsened since the 
screening visit (i.e., changed significantly  from the screening visit). The investigator should 
diagnose an AE when reporting the abnormal laboratory  value.
Subjects should be reminded to be well hy drated before all visits for phlebotomy . Subjects should 
fast for at least 8 hours before the visits when blood chemistry  testing is planned, except for the 
screening visit. The screening visit laboratory  values must be available before the baseline visit. 
Laboratory  testing conducted in a non -fasting state will not be a protocol deviation.

Page 48of 69If the result of a U PT is positive, it must be confirmed with a serum pregnancy  test. Subjects with 
a positive serum pregnancy  test result during the study  must be withdrawn from the study .
14.8 Virology
Virology  including HBsAg, HBcAb, HCV, HIV-1 and HIV-2 antibodies will be assessed at the 
screening visit. Subjects with a positive HBcAb and a negative HBsAg can be included if the 
hepatitis B surface antibody  is positive (considered immune after a natural infection). Subjects who 
are positive for HCV antibody  and negative for HCV RNA can be included.
14.9 Tuberculosis Testing
Immunosuppressant biologic treatments have been shown to increase the risk of TB infection or to 
cause conversion from latent to active TB sometimes. Because of this, subjects will be screened 
for active or latent TB before entry  into this study .
14.9.1 Definitions
Active TB is a disease caused b y Mycobacterium tuberculosis in an y part of the bod y and  that is in 
an active state as determined by either a smear or culture taken from any source in the person's 
body  which tests positive for TB or by radiographic evidence. Individuals with active TB are 
symptomatic, depending upon the location of the disease (most commonly  in the lungs but also 
possibly  in the brain, kidney s, spine, or elsewhere), and can spread the infection to others.
Latent TB is said to exist when an individual is infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, as 
evidenced by a positive Interferon Gamma Release Assay  (Mazurek 2010 ), such as QuantiFERON -
TB Gold, but is asymptomatic and has no evidence of active infection on screening pathology  or 
radiographic tests. Such individuals do not pass the disease to others and should commence a course 
of proph ylactic antimy cobacterial treatment to eliminate the infection and commit to completing 
the course of treatment.
14.9.2 Tuberculosis Screening
Ideally, as part of the medical history , the subject should be asked if they have presented with active 
or latent TB in the past and whether they have received a bacillus Calmette -Guérin vaccination. 
They  should also be asked if they  have been in contact with any  individuals known to have active 
TB or been placed in any circumstances that may have exposed them to an increased risk of TB 
infection, such as travel to TB endemic regions, close contact with persons with active TB, or 
workplace risk (e.g., prison, hospitals).
A subject who tests positive for latent TB (with a positive QuantiFERON -TB Gold test) should be 
referred to the subject’s treating physician for follow -up unless the subject has a documented 
history  of completion of an appropriate TB treatment regimen with no history  of re-exposure to TB 
since her/his treatment was completed. If the result is indeterminate, the test may  be repeated once.

result.
14.10 Adverse Events
Adverse Event Definition: An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical 
study  subject administered a medicinal product which does not necessarily have a causal 
relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign 
(including an abnormal laboratory  finding), s ymptom, or disease temporally  associated with using 
a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not it is related to the medicinal (investigational) 
product. This includes an exacerbation of pre -existing conditions or events, intercurrent illnesses, 
drug interaction, or the significant worsening of the indication under investigation not recorded 
elsew here in the eCRF under specific efficacy assessments.
Note(s):
Any new sign or symptom reported by the subject that appears after accidental or intentional 
overdose or misuse of study  drug should be reported as an AE.
A diagnosis should be reported on the AE Form, instead of signs, symptoms, or abnormal 
laboratory  values.
Pregnancy  is not to be considered an AE; however, it must be monitored and reported as 
described in Section 14.10.5 .
Each worsening of a chronic disease from the screening visit should be reported as a new AE.
The investigator or designee will report all AEs that occur from the time the ICF is signe d until the 
end of the study . The Sponsor/CRO should be informed if the investigator learns of any safet y 
information that appears to be drug -related, even after the subject has completed the clinical study.
At each post enrollment visit, the investigator (or sub- investigator) will question the subject about 
AEs using an open non-persuasive question to elicit reporting of AEs (for example, “Have you 
noticed any change in your health since the last visit?”). Directed questioning and examination will 
then be performed.
Any AE during the AE reporting period, whether it is related to the study  drug(s) or not, will be 
recorded immediately  in the source document and described on the AE Form along with the date 
of onset, severit y, rel ationship to the study  drug(s), and outcome, omitting no requested and known 
information. Additional information will be requested under certain circumstances.
AEs assessed as related to the treatment or study  procedure will be monitored until they have 
resolved or reached a stable cond ition. Other AEs will be monitored until the last visit if they have 
not resolved or reached a stable condition.
The investigator will obtain and maintain in the subject’s files all pertinent medical records, 
information and medical judgment from colleague s who assisted in the treatment and follow -up of

Page 50of 69the subject. If necessary , theinvestigator will contact the subject's personal physician or hospital 
staff to obtain further details.
Assessment of Severity: Each AE will be assigned a category  by the inves tigator:
Mild: An AE easil y tolerated b y the subject, causes minimal discomfort, and does not interfere 
with every day activities.
Moderate: An AE sufficiently  discomforting to interfere with normal every day activities; 
intervention may  be needed.
Severe: An AE that prevents normal every day activities; treatment or other intervention usually 
needed.
If there is a change in severity  of an AE, it must be recorded as a separate event.
Assessment of Causality: The investigator is to determine whether there is a reasonable causal 
relationship between the AE and exposure to the study drug (i.e., nemolizumab or placebo) and/or 
study  procedure (e.g., injection, topical background therap y, blood sample collection). Medical 
judgment should determine the relationship, considering all relevant factors including the pattern 
of the reaction, temporal relationships, relevant medical history , and confounding factors such as 
co-medication or concurrent diseases.
The expression “reasonable causal relationship” conveys in genera l there are facts or arguments to 
suggest a causal relationship (I CH E2A, Section IIIA 1).
The relationship assessment for an AE is to be completed using these definitions as a guideline for 
all AEs during this clinical study :
Reasonable Possibility: Accor ding to the reporting investigator, there is a reasonable possibility 
(i.e., suggestive evidence or arguments) there is a causal relationship despite the dose administered:
Between the stud y drug and the AE, and/or
Between the clinical study  protocol procedure (e.g., injection, topical background therap y, blood 
sample collection) and the AE
No Reasonable Possibility: No suggestive evidence or arguments can be identified regarding a 
causal relationship between the study  drug or the clinical study  protocol procedure and the AE.
Action Taken: The investigator will describe the action taken in the appropriate section of the 
eCRF:
None
Study  drug stopped
Study  drug temporarily  interrupted
Concomitant medication (an y additions or discontinuations)

Page 52of 6914.10.2 Serious Adverse Events
An SAE is any  untoward medical occurrence or effect that, at any  dose,
Results in death.
Is life-threatening (an AE is life -threatening if the subject was at immediate risk of death from 
the event as it occurred, i.e., it does not include a reaction that might have caused death had it 
occurred in a more serious form).
Requires or prolongs inpatient hospitalization. (Complications during hospitalization are AEs 
and SAEs if they prolong the hospitalization. Inpatient hospitalization is considered to have 
occurred if th e subject has had to stay  for a night at the hospital. The criterion for prolongation 
of hospitalization is also defined as an extra night at the hospital. Hospitalization may not 
constitute sufficient grounds to be an SAE if it is solely  for diagnostic tests [even if related to 
an AE], elective hospitalization for an intervention alread y planned before subject enrollment in 
the clinical study , admission to a day care facility , social admission [e.g., if the subject has no 
place to sleep], or administrative admission [e.g., for a yearly examination]. The details of such 
hospitalizations must be recorded on the medical history  or ph ysical examination eCRF.)
Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity. (An AE is incapacitating or disabling if 
itresults in a substantial and/or permanent disruption of the ability  to carry  out normal life 
functions.)
Results in a congenital anomaly /birth defect.
An important medical event that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require 
hospitalization , may  be considered an SAE when, based upon medical judgment, the event may 
jeopardize the safety of the subject, and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 
1 of the outcomes listed above in this definition. Examples of such events are intensive treatment 
in an emergency  room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasia, or convulsions 
that do not result in hospitalization.
14.10.3 Serious Adverse Event Reporting
For any SAE during the clinical study , whether or not related to the study  drug and/or procedure, 
the investigator must:
1.Take prompt medical action, if necessary . The safety  of the subject is the first priority .
2.Ensure that the event is evaluated as an SAE. Immediately  notify  (within 24 hours of receipt 
of the event ) the  of an SAE report, by  email or 
fax number on the SAE form,

The demographics, medical history , drugs/therapies, and medical and surgical procedures 
forms must also be available for revie w in eCRF.
3.Send any  relevant information or medical records (e.g., laboratory  test results) to  
 within 3 days of receipt of this relevant information.
4.Monitor and record the progress of the event until it resolves or reaches a stable condition, with 
or without sequelae. For all additional follow -up evaluations, update the AESI  form within 3 
days of receipt of the updated information.
5.Obtain and maintain in the files all pertinent medical records, information, and medical 
judgments from colleagues who participate in the treatment and follow -up of the subject. If 
necessary , contact the subject's personal ph ysician or hospital staff to obtain further details.
6.When the outcome of the event is known, update the AESI form, if appropriate.
14.10.5 Procedure for Reporting Pregnancies
Any pregnancy  during clinical studies where the fetus could have been exposed to the study  drug 
must be monitored until its outcome to ensure the complete collection of safet y data. If a subject 
becomes pregnant, the investigator must:
1.Withdraw the subject from the clinical study . The subject must receive no further injection of 
the study  drug.
2.Complete fully the Pregnancy  Surveillance Form -Part I: Histor y and Start of Pregnanc y. Send 
by email or fax along with the exit form within 24 hours of receipt of the information, to  
 Refer to Section 14.10.5 .
Note: Immediate pregnancy  reporting is required by the investigator if it occurs during the 
clinical study  or within 12 weeks (± 5 days) of receiving the last dose of study  drug, whether 
or not the event is considered related to the investigational pr oduct. 
3.Monitor and record the progress of the pregnancy  until its outcome. Contact the subject's
regular physician (general practitioner or gynecologist) or hospital staff to obtain further details 
and ask for regular follow -up information.
4.Provide tri-monthly  updates until the final outcome of the pregnancy , by completing the 
Pregnancy  Surveillance Form -Part II: Course and Outcome of Pregnancy . For all additional

6.If the pregnancy  leads to an abortion (i.e., voluntary  abortion, spontaneous abortion, or 
therapeutic abortion), in utero death or congenital anomaly , follow the procedure for 
declaration of/reporting an SAE (see Section 14.10.3 ).
14.10.6 Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions
AEs that meet these criteria will be classified as SUSARs and reported to the appropriate regulatory  
authorities under applicable r egulatory  requirements for expedited reporting:
Serious
Unexpected (i.e., the event contradicts the Reference Safety  Information in the IBfor 
nemolizumab)
There is at least a reasonable possibility there is a causal relationship between the event and the 
study  treatment
The Sponsor or its delegate will comply  with country -specific regulatory  requirements relating to 
safet y reporting to regulatory  authorities, IRB/IEC and investigators. Investigator safet y reports are 
prepared for SUSARs according to local regulatory  requirements and Sponsor policy  and are 
forwarded to investigators as necessary .
An investigator who receives an investigator safety  report describing a SUSAR or other specific 
safet y information (e.g., summary  or listing of SAEs) from the Sponsor or its delegate will file it 
(i.e., withinthe Trial Master File), and will notify the IRB/ IEC, if appropriate according to local 
requirements.
14.10.7 Overdose
Study  drug overdose is the accidental or intentional use of the drug in an amount higher than the 
dose being studied. The investigator must immediately  notify  the Sponsor of any occurrence of 
overdose with stud y drug (see Section 14.10).

16 P HARMACOKINETIC PARAMETERS
PK parameters will be calculated by a dedicated CRO with a non-compartmental analysis (NCA) 
using actual sampling times. For PK calculations, the program package Phoenix WinNonlin 
(Version 8.1 or above) will be used. Phoenix WinNonlin will also be used to generate 
concentration -time plots. Details related to the calculation of PK parameters will be described in a 
PK plan , which will be finalized before the beginning of PK anal ysis.
The following PK parameters will b e calculated:
Primary  PK parameters
Cmax Observed maximum serum concentration
AUC 0-inf Area under the concentration -time curve extrapolated to infinity , calculated, if 
feasible, as AUC 0-last+ C last/λz, where C lastis the last measurable drug concentration
Secondary PK parameters
AUC 0-4week sArea under the concentration- time curve over the specified interval, calculated with 
the linear trapezoidal method
AUC 0-last Area under the concentration -time curve from administration to the last observed 
concentratio n time t, calculated with the linear trapezoidal method
Tmax Time to achieve C max
t1/2 Half-life, calculated, if feasible, as ln 2/λ z
Cl/F Total body  clearance for extravascular administration, calculated, if feasible, as 
dose/AUC 0-inf
Vd/F Apparent volume of distribution for extravascular administration, calculated ,if 
feasible, as dose/AUC 0-infλz
For parameters requiring the terminal elimination rate constant λz to be estimated, it will be 
calculated, if feasible, b y log -linear regression using at leas t 3 concentration -time points excluding 
Cmax.
All individual concentration data and PK parameters will be listed for AI and DCS together with 
summary  statistics of geometric mean, median, arithmetic mean, standard deviation, CV, and 
minimum and maximum. Plots will be provided in original scale and semi -logarithmic scale for 
each subject in addition to mean data plots.

Page 57of 6916.1 Exposure -Response Analysis
If the confidence intervals (CIs)for the primary  PK parameters are outside the 80.00 to 125.00% 
acceptance range, acceptance of greater differences in PK parameters might be supported based on 
a clinical justification that these differences are clinically  irrelevant PK/pharmacod ynamic (PD) 
models may support lack of clinically  meaningful impact on AD (peak pruritus numeric rating scale 
[PPNRS], Eczema Area and Severit y Index, and Investigator’s Global Assessment) or PN 
(PP NRS) clinical endpoints. This approach is based on the observatio nthat,within the considered 
magnitude of dose changes, relationship between dose and average exposure is linear. Details 
related to exposure -response analysiswill be described in a PK plan, which will be finalized before 
the beginning of PK analy sis.

Page 58of 6917 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
A statistical analysis plan will be prepared after the protocol is approved. This document will 
explain the definition of analysis variables and analysis methodology to address all study 
objectives. The statistical anal ysis plan will serve as a compliment to the protocol and supersedes 
it if differences occur.
The statistical evaluation will be performed using SASsoftware version 9.4 or higher (SAS 
Institute, Cary , NC). All data will be listed. All primary  and secondary  efficacy  endpoin ts, and 
safet y endpoints will be summarized. Summary  statistics will be presented by treatment group. For 
continuous variables, data will be summarized with the number of subjects (N), mean, standard 
deviation, median, minimum, and maximum by treatment group. For categorical variables, data 
will be tabulated with the number and proportion of subjects for each category b y treatment group.
17.1 Determination of Sample Size
From previous studies conducted with nemolizumab, inter-subject standard deviation is expect ed 
to be approximately  38.5%, which provides an inter-subject variabilit y CVfor the primary  PK 
parameters of 40%. A sample size of 96 subjects per arm (AI or DCS) should provide a 90% power 
of claiming the bioequivalence between AI and DCS administration within the range 80.00 to 
125.00% for the primary  PK parameters with the expected GMR of 0.95.
Approximately  192 healthy  subjects are planned to be randomized in this study .
17.2 Analysis Populations
Safety Population: The safet y population (SAF) will consist of all randomized subjects who 
received the single dose of study  drug and will be the primary  population for all safet y data .
Pharmacokinetic Population: The PK population will include all randomized subjects who
received the dose of study  drug and provide devaluable data that can be used for the PK analy ses.
The PK population will be the primary  population for PK anal yses.
17.3 Statistical Analysis of Pharmacokinetic Parameters
17.3.1 Primary Pharmacokinetic Endpoints
For the primary  PK endpoint analyses, a linear mix ed-effect model will assess the log transformed 
PK parameters (AUC 0-infand Cmax) of nemolizumab, with treatment (administration with AI or 
DCS) and injection site as fixed effects and subject as a random effect. Some clinically  important 
baseline characte ristics may also be included in themodel . The AUC and CmaxGMR between 
treatments (nemolizumab administered with AI [test] or DCS [reference]) after back -
transformation and the corresponding 90% CI will be provided overall.

means of the parameters under consideration within the 80.00 to 125.00% range.
In addition, the GMR and 90% CI  will be provided by  injection site for information only .
17.3.2 Secondary Pharmacokinetic Endpoints
Tmaxwill be analy zed using the non -parametric Wilcoxon signed- rank test.
AUC 0-last,AUC 0-4weeks, and t1/2will be analy zed using the methods applied for the primary  PK 
parameters.
17.4 Safety Analysis
Adverse Events: All reported AEs will be coded using the most recent version of MedDRA. 
TEAEs, defined as those AEs after the first administration of study  treatment until last study  visit, 
will be tabulated in frequency  tables by System Organ Class and Preferred Term. Additional 
summary  tables will be provided for SAEs, AEs related to the study  drug(s) (reasonable possibility , 
no reasonable possibility ), AEs related to the study  procedure, AESIs, and AEs leading to treatment 
discontinuation and study withdrawal. For an AE, a subject will be counted once even if he/she has 
experienced multiple episodes of that AE.
Pretreatment AEs will be listed separatel y.
Clinical Laboratory: Laboratory  data (absolute values and change from baseline) will be 
summarized by visit and treatm ent group. In addition, the number and percentage of subjects below, 
within, and above the laboratory  reference ranges and the number and percentage of subjects who 
met criteria of potential clinically  significant value will be summarized by treatment group. Shift 
tables will be generated using the reference ranges. Reference ranges will be provided in the 
laboratory  manual.
Vital Signs: All vital signs and weight data (absolute values and change from baseline) will be 
summarized by visit and treatment group. In addition, the number and percent of subjects with 
clinically  significant abnormal values (of clinical concern as identified by  the investigator) will be 
summarized by  treatment group.
12-Lead Electrocardiogram: The number and percentage of subjects with ECGs that are 
abnormal/clinicall y significant and abnormal/not clinically  significant will be display ed by 
treatment at each visit.
Concomitant Medications: Prior and concomitant medications will be coded according to the 
most recent version of the Wor ld Health Organization Drug Dictionary Enhanced for Concomitant 
Medication and summarized.

Page 67of 69Appendix 1 Specific Guidance for Study Conduct and Subject Safety during the 
Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID- 19) Pandemic
This guidance applies during the COVID -19 pandemic, as defined by regional and/or local 
authorities. The updates summarized below relate to the referenced sections of the protocol.
Section 7.4 Risk/Benefit Assessment
During the COVID -19 pandemic, additional risks to participants may exist, including general 
environmental risks (e.g., b eing outside the home, possible contact with unsanitized surfaces) and 
study -related activities (e.g., interaction with study staff).
Potential new subjects with known or suspected COVID -19 are ineligible for study  enrollment until 
the infection has resolved. Potential new subjects in a high -risk population for COVID -19 (e.g., 60 
years and older), should be temporaril y deferred until the COVI D-19 risk has subsided at the 
location of the enrolling site, according to investigator judgment. Risk mitigation measures to be 
implemented for enrolled subjects and for new subjects during the COVID -19 pandemic are 
detailed inAdditional Measures for Subjects Amidst COVID -19 Pandemic below . Subjects 
with known or suspected COVID -19 during the study  should follow the local regulations andcome 
back to the study  center after appropriate quarantine time and once the infection has resolved .
Known or suspected COVID -19will also be followed as an AESI.
New Subsection to Section 9.1, Description of Overall Study Design and Plan : Additional 
Measures for Subjects Amidst COVID- 19 Pandemic
All investigational sites should act according to site regulations, to guidelines and restrictions 
implemented by local authorities, and to best practices for conducting clinical research during the 
COVID -19 pandemic.
Guidance for New Subjects:
Best practices in place must be followed when evaluating eligibility  of subjects to participate in the 
study  during the COVID -19 pandemic.
For potential subjects in a high -risk population for COVID -19 (e.g., 60 years and older), deferring 
participation in the study  should be considered. Deferment of enrollment is based on the potential 
risk posed by generic environmental risks (e.g., being outside home, possible contact with 
unsanitized surfaces) and study -related activities (e.g., interaction with study  staff).
For potential subjects in the low -risk population for COVID -19 (e.g., less than 60 years of age and 
without comorbidities), the risks and benefits of participation in the study  should be assessed case 
by case.
If at the time of screening, in the opinion of the Investigator, the subject will not be willing and 
able to reach the investigational si te and comply  with the time commitments and requirements of 
the clinical study  protocol, the subject should not be considered for enrol lment . The subject may 
be rescreened at a later time.

Page 68of 69Pre-screening phone calls should be conducted to exclude potential candidates/subjects who 
display  possible symptoms of COVID -19 or are at high risk of having been exposed to COVID -19.
Guidance for Enrolled Subjects: 
If the local situation allows for subjects to reach the clinical investigational site and complete all 
study procedures, these measures should be taken:
Implement and document in the subject’s records regular communication with the subject to 
ensure earl y detection of potential signs/symptoms of COVI D-19, and provide adequate advice, 
as per local medical practice and public health guidelines for suspected COVID -19. Please refer 
to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) : https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019 -
ncov/index.html 
Report COVID -19(confirmed or suspected) as an AE:
if any  seriousness criterion is m et, also report as an SAE (see Section 14.10.3 ).
if it occurs during the clinical study  following the study  drug administration, also report as 
an AESI  (see Section 14.10.4 ).
Implement preventive infection control measures against COVID -19 following local guidelines 
(e.g., good hygiene practice, cl ean techniques, and use of personal protective equipment such as 
gloves, goggles, and masks).
If the local situation allows for subjects to reach the investigational site and complete only some 
study  procedures where visit duration needs to be limited, the above measures also appl y.
Subjects can be dosed at baseline visit only if, considering the local situation and risk of exposure 
to COVI D-19, the site considers that:
The stud y drug subcutaneous injection can be performed at the investigational site acco rding to 
the instructions in the protocol, pharmacy manual and instruction for use, including preparation 
of study  drug b y thepharmacist or other qualified personnel.
If the local situation does not allow for subjects to reach the investigational site during the stud y:
Remote collection of data by Investigator or delegate is still to be done for these assessments at 
the regularl y scheduled visit time, by  phone or video call:
AE collection
Concomitant therapies used
UPT results (for WOCBP)
All laboratory  samples should be collected at the site and analy zed at the local lab. Only  when 
subject safet y cannot be assured otherwise and subject cannot reach the site, a local laboratory 
test (i.e., hematology , blood chemistry , urinal ysis) can be per formed and reported, based on 
investigator judgment.

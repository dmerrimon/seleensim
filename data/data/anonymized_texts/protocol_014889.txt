 Page 8 of 34 007-13 03.01T  2.0 Ethical Considerations and Regulatory Co mpliance  
This clinical study will be conducted in accordance with the study plan, the ethical 
principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki, and the following:  
• ISO 14155a 
 
3.0 Objectives of the Clinical Study  
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the necessity of adjunctive therapy following treatment of stenoses of a mature native AV dialysis access circuit fistula or graft with the Enforcer b alloon compared to stenoses initially treated with commercially 
available conventional balloon angioplasty.  4.0 Device Description  
4.1 Intended Use  
The Enforcer  balloon is intended for percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) of 
lesions in peripheral arteries including iliac, renal, popliteal, infrapopliteal, femoral and iliofemoral as well as obstructive lesions of native or synthetic arteriovenous dialysis fistulae. This device is n ot for use in the cerebral or coronary vasculature. 
 For this study, the Enforcer balloon will be used in the treatment of obstructive lesions of native or synthetic arteriovenous dialysis fistula.  
4.2 General Device Description  
The Enforcer balloon is a double-lumen catheter with a balloon near its distal tip. Four 
polymer elements are incorporated into the balloon, which provide f ocal-force upon 
inflation. These elements will aid in opening lesions. Platinum/iridium, radiopaque 
markers are positioned on the shaft within the balloon to enable visualization of the catheter/balloon under fluoroscopy. The catheter is compatible with 0.035 inch 
(0.89 mm) wire guides.  
                                                 
 
a The study will not require strict adherence to a ll aspects of ISO 14155: 2011. Regarding section 6.8.1, 
Traceability of documents and data: A signature and date from a member of the investigation team will not 
be necessary  for all source documentation. Regarding section 6.4.1, Adverse events  and section 9.8, Safety 
Reporting : Adverse event reporting will be limited to those events listed in this Study Plan Section 9.6: 
Adverse Events. Event reporting may not occur until the patient’s medical record revie w for the 90 -Day 
Chart Review. Regarding section 4.7.4, Information to be provided to the subject: It may not be necessary 
for the patient to document their agreement to inform their personal physician of participation in the study.

• Summary of the necessary  training and experience required for use of these 
devices  
• Description of the procedures involved in the use of these device 
4.3 Device Identification and Tracking   
The study device is FDA cleared for use in the United States and will be obtained through standard commercial processes. Information regarding device dimensions and lot numbers will be reported through an electronic data capture system.  
 5.0 Background Information 
The safety and performance of the Enforcer balloon were assessed through a series  of 
nonclinical tests performed in accordance with verified methods and procedures to 
maintain the integrity of the results. The testing results provide reasonable assurance that the potential risks associated with the use of the device have been mitigated  to an 
acceptable level. Additionally, conventional balloon angioplasty is a standard treatment for dialysis access dysfunction and several clinical evaluations have been performed and reported in literature, which assess safety and performance of angioplasty using different balloon technologies (e.g., conventional balloons, high pressure balloons, cutting balloons).
1 
 A prospective, single- arm, single -center clinical evaluation of the Enforcer balloon was 
previously conducted to evaluate the treatment of A V access stenos es.
2 The study 
evaluated the treatment of 39 AV fistula lesions in 28 patients who  were treated with 37 
Enfo rcer balloons; patients were followed for 6 months post-procedure. Device success, 
defined as < 30% residual stenosis immediately following treatment was 64.1% (25/39). Similarly, 92.3% (36/39) of lesions were reduced to < 50% residual stenosis. Overall, 
treatment with the Enforcer balloon led to a reduction in the average percent diameter 
stenosis of the treated lesion from 66.3% pre-procedure to 23.7% post-procedure. The average maximum inflation pressure required was  12.3 atm. Only one lesion  required 
adjunctive treatment following angioplasty with the study balloon, indicating that

 Page 10 of 34 007-13 03.01T  clinically relevant luminal gains can be achieved with the study device alone, without the 
need for a high pressure balloon or other additional therapies.  
 Following the study procedure, all patients could resume normal dialysis. The Kaplan -
Meier estimates for patency at 90 days and 6 months were 62.0% and 25.1%, 
respectively. The rate of access site complications were low (1/28; 3.6%). Overall, the 
data supported the safety of the Enforcer ballon for the treatment of stenotic lesions in mature native AV hemodialysis access circuits.  
 6.0 Risk Analysis an d Risk Assessment  
6.1 Risks and Foreseeable Adverse Events 
Please reference the IFU for the following: 
• Potential adverse events

 COMPANY CONFIDENTIAL  
 Page 11 of 34 007-13 03.01T  • Capture, handling, and storage of the study data are done in compliance with 
applicable regulations to minimize the risk of release of any personal health information  
The risks of the study have been minimized and the residual risks are considered acceptab le because they do not outweigh the potential for benefit. 
 7.0 Design of the Clinical Study  
7.1 Design  of the Clinical Study 
This multicenter, stratified, randomized, controlled clinical study will evaluate  the 
performance of the Enforcer b alloon compared to commercially available conventional 
balloons (defined as less than 25 atm rated burst pressure) in the treatment of stenoses of 
the AV dialysis access circuit . 
 This study will enroll approximately 200 patients at up to 10 clinical sites . Enrollment 
will end when it is determined a minimum of 250 lesions have been treated. 
7.2 Study Design Rationale A randomized clinical trial allows for the direct comparison of the rates of adjunctive 
treatment  between the Enforcer balloon and other comme rcially available standard 
angioplasty balloons. 
7.3 Duration of the Study and Patient Participation  
Patient enrollment is expected to be completed within 1 year  of study initiation . Total 
study duration (from study initiation through patient enrollment and follow-up) is 
expected to be 15 months. 
 A review of the patient’s medical chart through  90 days after the study procedure will be 
conducted. 
7.4 Measures to be Taken to Avoid or Minimize Bias This study is designed as a stratified, randomized, controlled clinical trial to minimize 
bias in both assigning patients to treatments and in analyzing the results. Each clinical 
site is limited to a maximum number of patients  (as described in Section 11.1: Sample 
Size)  to minimize bias that may be introd uced if the majority of patients are enrolled at 
Cook Research Incorporated  Version: 17-04-02 
Enforcer Post- Market Study   Version Date: 03 Aug  2018 
 COMPANY CONFIDENTIAL  
 Page 12 of 34 007-13 03.01T  one or two clinical sites. In addition, t he study will utilize uniform d efinitions for study 
endpoints. 
7.4.1 Randomization 
Once baseline angiograp hy is complete and patient eligibility is confirmed, patient s will 
be randomized into either the Enforcer balloon or conventional angioplasty group prior to 
treatment. At each study site, patients will be stratified for randomization based on the number of lesions requiring treatment (single lesion or two lesions) and type of AV access circuit (fistula or graft), then randomized to one of the treatment groups in a 1:1 ratio.  
7.5 Endpoints 
7.5.1 Primary Endpoint The primary endpoint is the percentage of lesions receiving  adjunctive treatment 
immediately following the  study procedure (i nitial treatment with the Enforcer or 
conventional angioplasty balloon).  7.5.2  Secondary Endpoints 
• Numeric rating scale (NRS) for pain experienced during study procedure balloon 
inflations  
• Procedural cost  
• Procedure times  
• Maximum balloon pressure 
• Device success  
• Safety measures , including rupture, circumferential tears, and 
reintervention/patency 
7.5.3 Additional Measures  
• Anatomic success  
• Clinical success  
• Adverse events  (refer to Section 9.6: Adverse Events for a list of reportable 
events)  
• Primary patency through 90 days

recorded on the appropriate electronic case report forms  (eCRFs). 
9.1 Pre-procedure 
A pre -procedural clinical assessment will be com pleted and will include patient 
demographics and medical history. Baseline data will be collected and recorded on 
appropriate eC RFs. Baseline angiography should be performed prior to study enrollment 
to assess and document study lesion(s) characteristics including length, location , and 
percent (%)  stenosis. Up to two  distinct lesions can be treated within the dialysis acces s 
circuit. Pre-treatment for thrombosed dialysis access circuits may be performed (e.g., 
thrombectomy or  thrombolysis) prior to enrollment in the study. Also, central venous 
lesions that require treatment (i.e., >50% stenosis) to meet eligibility criteria must be 
treated successfully prior to treatment of the study lesion . Successful treatment of the 
central veins is defined as less than  30% residual stenosis.  
 Once baseline angiography is complete and patient eligibility is confirmed, patients will be randomized as described in Section 7.4.1 into either the Enforcer  balloon or 
conventional angioplasty balloon (defined as balloons with rated burst pressure of less 
than 25 atm) group prior to treatment.   Assessment(s) required to be completed  prior to patient enrollment are  summarized  in

appropriate eCRF.  
9.2 Point of Enrollment 
Patients are considered enrolled in the study once the balloon catheter is first introduced 
into the patient’s body. 9.3 Study Procedure  
PTA with either the Enforcer  balloon or conventional angioplasty balloon will be 
performed  and recorded  in accordance with the manufacturer’s IFU to achieve a residual 
stenosis <  30%. The balloon diameter may  be chosen based on the recommendations in 
the IFU. If necessary, the balloon could be deflated, repositioned, and re- inflated to 
achieve a residual stenosis < 30%. Inflation details (e.g., maximum pressure and duration 
of inflations) will be recorded on an appropriate e CRF. Conventional angioplasty 
balloons are defined as those having a rated burst pressure less than  25 atmospheres. 
Completion angiography to assess percent residual stenosis  of the treated study lesion(s) 
should be performed immediately fol lowing the study procedure ( initial treatment with 
Enforcer or conventional angioplasty balloon) and p rior to beginning any adjunctive 
procedures. 
 The physician may also perform adjunctive procedures (e.g., using a high -pressure 
balloon, cutting balloon, stent , or stent graft ) if in the  best interest of the patient. High -
pressure angioplasty balloons are defined as those having a rated burst pressure greater 
than or equal to 25 atmospheres. The  adjunctive procedure may  be performed in 
accordance with the device manufacturer’s IFU to achieve a residual stenosis < 30%. Completion angiography following any adjunctive procedures should also be performed . 
Any additional procedures performed will be documented on the appropriate e CRF.  
 All angiographic images and medical charges (i.e., UB -04 or CMS-1500) should be 
provided to the Sponsor on the appropriate eCRF. Total procedure time (defined as the time from needle entry for intervention to sheath withdrawal) as well as  total procedural 
charges will be recorded on the appropriate eCRF s.

 Page 21 of 34 007-13 03.01T  11.0 Statistical Considerations 
11.1 Sample Size  
The expected rates of adjunctive therapy for the Enforcer balloon and conventional 
angioplasty groups were assumed to be 5% and 15%, respectively. A sample size of at 
least 250 total lesions (125 lesions per group) is required to detect a 10% difference in the 
rate of adjunctive therapy  with a power of 80% and a type I error of 0.05. Prior 
experience suggests that 40% of patients, on average, would also have a second lesion 
treated . Therefore the study will enroll approximately 200 patients (approximately 100 
patients per group) and enrollment will continue until at least 250 lesions are treated.  
Procedural outcomes are unlikely to depend on the connectivity between lesions within an AV dialysis access circuit or the patient -level factors which affect longer -term 
outcomes, and therefore lesions were assumed to be independent for the purposes of the sample size calculation.   
 Up to 10 clinical sites will be included in the study , and t he maximum enrollment per 
clinical site will be no more than 80 patients or 40% of the total enrollment. There is n o 
minimum enrollment threshold. Patients that withdraw from the study will not be replaced.  
11.2  Randomization 
Once patient eligibility is confirmed, patients will be randomized into either the Enforcer 
balloon or conventional angioplasty group prior to treatment in a 1:1 ratio  at each study 
site. Randomization will be  first stratified by the number of lesions requiring treatment 
(singl e lesion or two lesions) and type of AV access circuit (fistula or graft). Using 
restricted  randomization maximize s the balance of treatment allocations within stratum 
and vice vers a. Randomization codes will be maintained by the Sponsor. 
11.3  Analyses  
11.3.1 Primary endpoint analysis 
The study is intended to compare the necessity of adjunctive therapies for lesions treated 
with the study device (Enforcer balloon) compared to those treated with the control 
device (conventional angioplasty balloon inflated to standard pressures). The null (H
0) 
and alternative (H A) hypotheses are expressed as follows:  
 
Cook Research Incorporated  Version: 17-04-02 
Enforcer Post- Market Study   Version Date: 03 Aug  2018 
 COMPANY CONFIDENTIAL  
 Page 22 of 34 007-13 03.01T  H0: AT EB ≥ AT CA 
HA: AT EB < AT CA 
 
where AT EB is the rate of adjunctive therapies in the Enforcer balloon group and  AT CA is 
the rate of adjunctive therapies  in the conventional angioplasty balloon group. 
 The rates of adjunctive therapies will be compared between the two treatment groups 
with a one- sided Z -test. A p-value < .05 will be used to claim statistical significance. If 
the number of patients within each  strata are sufficiently large, the association of 
stratification factors and treatment will be assessed. Crude and adjusted , if applied, 
differences  in rate of adjunctive therapies  between the two treatment groups and 95% 
confidence intervals will be reported .  
11.3.2 Analysis of secondary endpoints 
Differences in pain, procedural costs, procedure times, and maximum balloon pressure 
will be assessed overall by  one- sided  t-tests, with Enforcer balloon having favorable 
outcomes. In addition, regression model s will be used to incorporate the stratification 
factors as covariates and reported if found to be significant. If the parametric assumptions 
are not met , nonparametric methods will be used. The safety claim will be evaluated with 
a Z-statistic, with  a non- inferiority  of Enforcer balloon at a margin of 10%. The observed 
non-inferiority margin will also be presented.  
 Adjustments for multiplicity will be made using the Holm procedure to control the family -wise error rate to 0.05 across the family of se condary endpoints. 
11.3.3 A nalysis  of additional measures 
The same analysis strategies  will be applied to  the additional measures. For continuous 
measures, the difference between the two treatment groups will be assessed by t- test 
statistics. The impact of  the two stratification variable s on the outcomes between the two 
groups will also be explored, and reported if the test suggests a difference. If the 
parametric assumptions are not met, nonparametric methods will be used. Survival analysis techniques such as Kaplan -Meier or Cox Proportional Hazards will be 
incorporated if censoring of data occurs.  Key components of the additional measures may also be compared, including specific adverse events associated with the procedure, such as vessel rupture or tear.

 COMPANY CONFIDENTIAL  
 Page 23 of 34 007-13 03.01T  11.4 Missing Data  
For the primary endpoint, minimal or no missing data is expected. Missing primary 
outcome will be assumed missing at random and excluded for analyses. However, if more 
than 5% of primary endpoint is missing, multiple imputation technique will be applied 
followed by sensitivity analyses. All the other measurements will be analyzed accordingly with all available data using a complete case approach . 
11.5 Site-level Poolability  
This is a multi-c enter  study with up to 10 clinical sites. It is not intended to incorporate 
study sites into primary endpoint analyses. However, the primary endpoint will be 
examined across sites  and reported  if necessary .  
 12.0 Deviations from Study Plan 
Except under emergency situations when necessary to preserve the rights, safety , or well -
being of study patients, principal investigators are not allowed to deviate from this study 
plan with out documented prior approval by : 
• the sponsor; and   
• the IRB  
Clinical study noncompliances (i.e., deviations from the study plan, investigator 
agreement, IRB policy, and/or any applicable regulations/standards) wi ll be documented, 
along with an explanation and corrective and prevent ive actions, and reported to the 
sponsor.   The p rincipal investigator -required notifications/reports are described in Table 12.0-1. 
The reports wi ll be provided as required by the study plan, IRB policies, or local

 13.0 Data Collection and Management   
Patient data will be documented  and recorded  by trained personnel at the clinical site onto 
eCRFs through an EDC system. This is a secure, validated, web -based system, allowing 
those with permission to access data from any location at any time. Source data must be 
retained for all data entered into the EDC system.  The patient -reported pain assessment  
and the physician assessment of the quality and performance of the study product may be directly entered into the EDC system .  
 Clinical s ite personnel are required to undergo training and will have unique login names 
and passwords in order to enter patient data. In accordance with 21 CFR Part 11, the EDC system creates a secure, computer -generated, time stamped audit trail to record the date 
and time of operator entries and actions that create, modify, or delete electronic records.  
Principal investigators wi ll review and electronically sign the eCRFs to confirm that the 
data recorded are accurate and complete.  
 Principal investigators wil l provide all applicable clinical data and documentation to the 
sponsor in a timely manner . All clinical study documents (including patient data) must be 
retained  as required by the applicable regulations/standards. The principal investigator or

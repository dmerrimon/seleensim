PROTOCOL BODY  
1. Study Objective  
The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy ( changes in dentinal hyper sensitivity ) and 
safety (oral soft tissue evaluation) after use of  one of four dentifrices in subjects with pre -existing 
hypersensitivity  over a n 11-week period .  
2. Overall Study Design and Plan  
This is a  randomized , controlled , single center,  double -blind study to assess efficacy ( the changes 
in dentinal hypersensitivity ) and safety (oral soft tissue evaluat ion) of four dentifrices with different 
desensitizing technologies  over 8 weeks of  assigned  product use , follow ed by three week s of 
washout product use (Colgate Cavity Protection) .  After informed consent, approximately  150 
subjects with a history of tooth  sensitivity will be evaluated to enroll a target population of 
approximately 120 healthy adult volunteers with current dentinal hypersensitivity.  Subjects will 
be randomized to either a n experimental potassium oxalate dentifrice, marketed potassium nitrate 
dentifrice, marketed stannous fluoride dentifrice, or a regular anticavity dentifrice ( negative 
control ). Subjects will use assigned product for  8 week s. After 8 weeks, all subjects will use 
Colgate Cavity Protection and c ome bac k 3 week s later (W eek 11) to have their dentinal 
hypersensitivity re-evaluated .    Dentinal hypers ensitivity will be measured by  a standard thermal 
challenge  (cold air response measure via Schiff Index)  and probing force (calibrated Yeaple 
probe ).  Measure ments will be taken at Base line (before any treatment),  Day 3, Week 2, Week 4, 
Week 8  and Week 11.  Safety will be assessed from clinical examination  of the oral soft tissue . A 
digital image  of the oral soft tissue and hard tissue may be taken , at the discretion of the examiner.

Screening/Baseline  Visit 1  
Subjects will be asked to read and sign duplicate copies of the informed consent form which will 
be witnessed by site staff.  Subjects will be given one signed copy of the informed consent form 
and the other signed copy will be maintained as site source do cumentation.  Subjects will be 
asked to complete a confidentiality disclosure agreement.  Personal medical history information 
will be reviewed and retained as site source documentation. Subjects  will be asked to complete 
a questionnaire regarding their to oth sensitivity.  All screening data collected will be recorded on 
site source documentation.  Demographic information and entrance criteria will be assessed.  A 
comprehensive oral examination will then be conducted to evaluate the oral and perioral region , 
including hard and soft tissues .  Tactile sensitivity will be assessed using a standard calibrated 
Yeaple probe beginning at 10 g probing force.  Approximately 5 minutes later, t hermal sensitivity 
will be assessed using a standard cold air challenge  (Schiff Index) .  For each subject, 2 test teeth 
will be selected by the clinician for the study.  Eligibility will be determined via a Schiff score >1  
and Yeaple probe score between 10 -20 g.  If the qualifying eligible teeth are in the same quadrant, 
the two t est teeth should be separated by at least 2 other teeth.  Data for subjects with 2 qualifying 
teeth will be transcribed from source documents into the study database.   
Qualifying subjects will be randomly assigned to either an experimental potassium oxala te 
dentifrice, marketed potassium oxalate dentifrice, marketed stannous fluoride dentifrice, or a 
regular anticavity dentifrice (negative control)  to use at home daily for the first 8 weeks of the

B&A Program  
Eligible subjects will be stratified based on the Pre -treatment Schiff Index and Yeaple probe 
sensitivity scores, age, and gender.  Within strata, subjects will be randomly assigned to one of 
the treatment groups using an encoded program supplied by the Sponsor. This assignment 
process and the distribution of test products will be conducted in a protected area that will ensure 
blinding of the examiner to the identity of the test products. Product distribution and product return 
will be recorded on the Pro duct Distribution Log provided by the Sponsor.  Subjects from the 
same household will be assigned to the same treatment group.  
8. Product Usage  
Subjects will be instructed to brush twice daily.  Subject s will be instructed to apply at least a 1 -
inch strip of the  toothpaste onto the toothbrush and to brush thoroughly for 1 minute and 
expectorate.   
All subjects will be instructed to use only the assigned products in place of normal oral hygiene 
for the du ration of the study.  
9. Blinding, Labeling, and Shipping Plan  
The identity of the toothpaste will be disguised.  Kit boxes will contain 2 tubes of toothpaste, 1 
toothbrush, 1 timer and subject instructions.  Week  8 kit boxes will contain 1 tube of toothpaste,  
and subject instructions (subjects will use the same timer from previous kit box) for the 3-Week 
washout period.   
The kit boxes will be labeled with a unique kit number. Control and test kit boxes will be identically 
sized; the kit box labels will be ide ntical except for a unique kit number used for assignment.  Kit 
box labels will also contain the study number, emergency phone number, distributor 
name/address, appropriate caution statements, content statement and other information as 
required by internal regulations and clinical SOPs. The shipping containers will be labeled with 
the clinical site address and a content statement listing study number and kit box numbers 
contained within.  Supplemental products will be provided to site.   
The site will be provided with a code breaker report in a sealed envelope.  The sealed code 
breaker report contains documents that list the kit box number or treatment code while the identity 
of the treatment products is hidden by an opaque scratch -off seal.  If the study blind needs to be 
broken, an individual subject’s investigational product may be ascertained by opening the sealed 
code breaker report, locating the subject’s kit box number or treatment code and scratching off 
the opaque seal to reveal the treatment ident ity.  The sealed code breaker report will be opened 
if a clinically serious AE occurs or management of the subject requires knowledge of the identity 
of the investigational product.  The Investigator should immediately inform the Sponsor that the 
code will  be broken and record the date, time and reason for breaking the code in writing.  After 
the study is complete and the study database has been finalized and locked, the site will return 
Clinical Study Protocol Study No. 2019079  CONFIDENTIAL  
Page 10 of 16 Business Use  
the code breaker report to the Sponsor using the self -addressed, stamp ed envelope provided by 
the Sponsor.  
10. Determination of Sample Size  
Power analyses were conducted with α=0.05, using a 2 -sided test. Up to 120 subjects will be 
enrolled in the study assuming ~5% dropout rate.  Data were  utilized from a similarly designed 
study with the same examiner and endpoints (2018095). Twenty -eight subjects per group 
completing this trial should provide at least 90% power to detect a difference in Schiff  mean scores 
of at least 0. 80 units between treatments assuming the variability(s) of Schiff score is 0.8 8.  
Assuming the variability(s) of Yeaple score is 12. 44, a sample size of 28 subjects per group should 
provide at least 90% power to detect a difference in Yeaple score of at least 10.97  units between 
treatments.  
11. Safety Variables  
 
Safety Observations and/or Measurements  
Safety will be assessed by the absence of irreversible side effects.   
Oral Examination  
Assessment of the oral soft tissue is conducted via a visual examination of the oral cavity and 
perioral area utilizing a standa rd dental light, dental mirror, and gauze.  The structures examined 
include the gingiva (free and attached), hard and soft palate, oropharynx/uvula, buccal mucosa, 
tongue, floor of the mouth, labial mucosa, mucobuccal/mucolabial folds, lips, and perioral a rea.  
Assessment of the oral hard tissues will be conducted via a visual examination of the dentition 
and restorations utilizing a standard dental light, dental mirror, and air syringe.  All abnormal 
findings will be recorded and categorized by their locat ion; hard tissue findings will be categorized 
as “other.”  An AE will be recorded if a new abnormal finding is noted after product distribution or 
any previously noted abnormal finding increases in severi ty during the treatment period.  
12. Efficacy Variables  
 
Yeaple Probe Calibration  
The Yeaple probe will be calibrated each day subjects are seen and in accordance with the 
site’s internal SOPs.  The settings should be recorded, dated, and initialed by the person 
performing the calibration on an appropriate form.   A new form will not be necessary for each 
calibration; however, care should be taken so as not to use a different day's force settings.  This 
record will serve as the guide for the force setting for that day's examinations.  
Tactile Threshold Determinatio n 
Tactile sensitivity at test teeth will be assessed at the Baseline , Week 2  and Week 4 and Week 
8 visits  using th e Yeaple probe test. A #16 explorer tip will be used with the Yeaple probe. The 
tip will be kept perpendicular to the root surface of the toot h being tested. The tip will be moved 
horizontally across the facial surface over the sensitive area. Two horizontal sweeps across the 
entire facial surface are made at each force setting.  
At Baseline  (before treatment) , testing will be performed beginning  at 10 g.  The examiner will 
record tactile scores for responding teeth.  After treatment, testing will begin at 10 g and 
Clinical Study Protocol Study No. 2019079  CONFIDENTIAL  
Page 11 of 16 Business Use  
increase by 10 g to a maximum of 5 0 g.  Each successive challenge shall increase until a "yes" 
response will be repeated.  If a second  "yes" is not obtained, the force setting is increased to 
the next step and continued until a force is found which elicits two consecutive "yes" response s, 
which  will be recorded as the threshold on the Tactile Sensitivity Score form.  If no sensitivity is  
found up to 50 g, 50 will be recorded as the threshold.  
 
Cold Air  Challenge  
A one second application of cold air will be  delivered onto each tooth tested from  a standard 
dental unit syringe . 
Schiff Index Sensitivity Scale  
The examiner will record the Schi ff Index score corresponding to the response to the cold air 
challenge.   
Schiff Index Sensitivity Scale  
SCORE CRITERIA  
0 Tooth/Subject does not respond to stimulus  
1 Tooth/Subject responds to stimulus, but does not request discontinuation of stimulus  
2 Tooth/Subject responds to stimulus and requests discontinuation or moves from stimulus  
3 Tooth/Subject responds to stimulus, considers stimulus to be painful, and requests 
discontinuation of the stimulus  
13. Hypothesis  
 
The following hypotheses will be tested for each post -treatment  assessment . 
Null:    There is no  mean score  difference between treatment groups . 
Alternative:     
There is a mean score difference between treatment groups . 
 
For each treatment group , the following hypothesis will be tested for each post -treatment  
assessment . 
 
Null:   The post -treatment mean is equal to the pre -treatment mean.  
Alternative:    The post -treatment mean is not equal to the pre -treatment  mean . 
The Schiff Index Sensitivity Scale  at Week 4 will be of primary interest.  
14. Statistical and Analytical Plans  
The following statistical analyses will be performed for the sensitivity data (Schiff Index and 
Yeaple Tactile Sensitivity).  Sensitivity scores will be averaged amongst test teeth within each 
subject for each assessment before and after treatment .  For each treatment group and 
assessment, mean post -treatment assessments will be compared to pre -treatment using a 
statistical analysis for paired data that is either non -parametric or parametric (e.g., Wilcoxon 
signed rank test or one sample t -test).  For each post -treatment assessment , mean 
comparisons between treatment groups  will be analyzed using analysis of covariance with the

baseline score as a covariate with either  non-parametric or parametric methods.  If necessary, a 
mathematical transformation to the data may be performed to aid statistical assumptions 
associated with parametric analysis methods .  Statistical comparisons will utilize two-sided 
testing with a 5% s ignificance leve l.  Demographic and safety data will also be summarized.  
Additional statistical methods may be used to further investigate  these data.

APPENDIX  
Adverse Event Reporting  
Abnormal findings which may qualify as AEs are those that: 1) were not present at Baseline and 
occurred after product usages of any duration, or, 2) were present at Baseline and worsened in 
severity after product usage of any duration.  All AEs will be rec orded on the CRF. If a question 
should arise about the causal relationship of an AE to product usage, the Medical Monitor will 
be contacted to make the determination of relatedness.  
An unexpected  event is defined as one that is not identified in nature, s everity, or frequency in 
the current safety assessment.  The events will be reported to the FDA as required, upon 
receipt of pertinent clinical data and completion of the required forms.  
Any clinically significant abnormal laboratory finding, serious or un expected AE, or medical 
event which results in the withdrawal of a subject from the study, must be followed to resolution 
with appropriate medical management, or as deemed necessary (with the Sponsor’s 
agreement).   
Advertising  
Any advertisements used in r ecruitment of subjects must receive prior approval from P&G and 
the Investigator’s IRB.  A copy of the IRB -approved advertising and the documentation thereof 
must be provided to P&G.  
Data Collection  
The Investigator has the responsibility for ensuring that  all source documents (i.e., study and/or 
medical records) and CRFs are completed and maintained according to the study protocol and 
are available at the site.  
Case Report Forms  
The Data Manager will supply the paper and/or electronic CRFs to be used in th is study.   It is the 
responsibility of the Investigator to maintain and submit accurate and timely CRFs to the Sponsor.  
All hard copy CRFs will be filled out legibly in ink.  
All questions should be answered.   For paper CRFs, if an entry requires correctio n, a single line 
will be placed through the entry so as not to obscure the original record, the corrected entry will 
be initialed and dated by the individual making the change, and a reason will be given for the 
change.   There will be no whiteouts or erasu res.  For electronic CRFs, if an entry requires 
correction, the change is made directly to the CRF in the database, the user is prompted to 
provide a reason for the change, and the correction is logged in by an electronic audit trail.  
As necessary, the Dat a Manager may make specified allowable changes to the database without 
issuing a query to the site, as agreed upon by study site per this protocol. Examples of allowable 
changes include incorrect date formats, incorrect current year recorded (as in the sta rt of a new 
year), and unambiguous spelling errors. Changes to common abbreviations and symbols to 
equivalent text to meet system or coding constraints (e.g., @ = at, ~ = approximately), may also 
be allowable. Values that are ambiguous or open to interpret ation  will be queried to the sites. It is 
the responsibility of the Data Manager to ensure all changes are supported by information 
contained elsewhere and/or are unambiguous.

Source Documents  
The Investigator has the responsibility for ensuring that all s ource documents (i.e., study and/or 
medical records) and CRFs are completed and maintained according to the study protocol  and is 
available at the site. Any CRF used as a source document must be identified as such in the 
Investigator Notebook.  
Protocol Ame ndments/Changes  
Changes to the Protocol following IRB approval affecting the safety of subjects, scope or 
objectives of the investigation, or the scientific quality of the study will be documented as 
amendments.  Such changes will require the Sponsor, Inve stigator, and IRB approval prior to 
implementation, unless immediate action is required to safeguard subject safety.  Administrative 
or minor changes (e.g., typographical errors, changes in Sponsor personnel, etc.) will be 
documented as revisions but may n ot need to be submitted as amendments unless required by 
the IRB.  Any change in the Sponsor’s monitoring staff, Clinical Trial Manager or Medical Monitor 
during the conduct of the study, will be reported to the Investigator.  
Good Clinical Practices  
This s tudy is classified non -AMG, non -MPG according to German study classification but 
conducted in compliance with applicable sections of the US Federal Regulations governing 
informed consent (21 CFR 50) and IRBs (21 CFR 56).  The conduct of this study will be in 
accordance with ICH -GCPs as published by the FDA , with the Commission  Directive  2005/28/EC  
published by the European Union, and ISO 14155:2011 . During the course of the trial, the clinical 
site will allow monitoring by the Sponsor (Clinical Trial Manage r or designee) to check compliance 
with the Protocol, regulations and guidelines, adequacy of the equipment and facilities, and 
satisfactory data collection.  
Institutional Review  
Prior to study initiation, the Investigator must obtain institutional review and approval of the 
Protocol, the consent form, and other necessary study -related documents in compliance with 
the US Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Part 56 or the ICH -GCPs Consolidated 
Guidelines, Chapter 3  and in compliance with Procter & Gamble SOP QS -CL-05 (“Institutional 
Review Board/Independent Ethics Committee Review and Approval”) . The Investigator will 
maintain any original authorization letter(s) and will be available for review by the Sponsor. IRB 
approval letters should include the study title, Sponsor study number, the address of the IRB, 
date of request, and the signature of the IRB chairperson or designate.  Additionally, the letter 
must acknowledge that both the Protocol and consent form have b een approved by the IRB.  
The study will not begin until the Sponsor has received confirmation of IRB approval.  The IRB 
shall also review the investigation at least once a year during study execution. The Investigator 
will notify the IRB when the study is  terminated and provide confirmation that the study has 
been closed with the IRB to the Sponsor.  
Investigator Final Report  
Following completion of the study, the Investigator shall submit a final report to the Sponsor 
describing the conduct of the study, d eviations from planned conduct, early withdrawals and 
subject accountability, adverse events, and other information on study conduct.  The 
Investigator’s IRB may require more frequent status reports . 
Clinical Study Protocol Study No. 2019079  CONFIDENTIAL

Records Retention  
The Investigator must retain the subje ct identification codes, informed consent documentation, 
clinical materials inventory, CRFs (paper or electronic media), medical records and other source 
data for a minimum of 2 years after the last regulatory approval has been received or the 
discontinuat ion of the study.  The Investigator must receive written authorization from the Sponsor 
before destroying any study document. The Investigator will make the records available for 
inspection and copying upon the request of an authorized employee of a govern ment authority or 
the Sponsor, at reasonable times.  In the event the Investigator retires, relocates, or for any other 
reason withdraws from the responsibility for maintaining records for the period of time required, 
custody of the records may be transfer red to another person who will accept responsibility for the 
records.  Notice of such a transfer must be given in writing to the Sponsor.  
The Research Participant’s identification codes are a unique identifier assigned by the Principal 
Investigator to each  trial subject to protect the Research Participant’s identity and privacy.  The 
identification codes are used in lieu of the Research Participant’s name when the Principal 
Investigator reports all adverse events and other trial related data. These codes wi ll be used on 
all study documents for the Research Participant’s confidentiality (In order to protect the 
confidentiality of information concerning Research Participants, as stated in section 2.11 of the 
International Conference on Harmonization Good Clini cal Practice: Consolidated Guideline (ICH -
GCP).)  
Serious Adverse Event Reporting  
A serious adverse event  is defined as an event, which suggests a definite hazard or handicap to 
the subjects. Serious adverse events are any events resulting in death, life threatening situation, 
disability or permanent damage, hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospita lization, or 
congenital anomaly/birth defects; events requiring intervention to prevent permanent 
impairment/damage; or other serious (important) medical events.  
When an Investigator is notified of a serious AE, the Investigator must promptly (within 24 
hours) notify the Sponsor (Clinical Trial Manager or the Medical Monitor) of the serious or 
unexpected event, regardless of causality.   Within 5 working days, a written and/or electronic 
report describing the circumstances of the event must be submitted to t he Sponsor. The 
Investigator will be responsible for SAE reporting to the IRB.   
Study Medication Dispensing and Storage  
Study products will be stored in a secure area, under environmental condition as required by label 
instructions or as described in the Protocol and  dispensed only under the authorization of the 
Investigator.  The storage condition shall be properly documented.  Both the receipt and 
dispensation of all test products (used and unused) will be documented using forms provided by 
the Sponsor or  suitable forms provid ed by the site. Study products will be returned to the Sponsor 
following the trial, or alternatively, they will be destroyed at the clinical site provided the site has 
an existing SOP for the destruction of clinical materials and prio r written approval from the 
Sponsor.  
Subject Consent  
The Investigator will obtain written informed consent for each subject prior to participation in the 
study, per the US Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Parts 50.25 and 50.27 and ICH -GCPs, 
Chapter 4 , subpart 4.8  and in compliance with Procter & Gamble SOP QS -CL-04 (“Informed 
Consent Form, Ethics Approval and Investigator Use”) . Subjects, or their legal guardian, are 
Clinical Study Protocol Study No. 2019079  CONFIDENTIAL  
Page 16 of 16 Business Use  
required to read, sign and date an IRB approved consent form with the Investigator al so 
maintaining a signed and dated copy.  The subject or legal guardian will be given a copy of the 
consent form. All study procedures must be explained in non -technical terms.

In the event multiple procedures are required at a single time point, the 12-lead electrocardiogram 
(ECG )may be obtained up to 15 minutes earlier, vital signs may be obtained up to 10 minutes 
earlier or later, and the clinical laboratory  blood sample may be obtained up to 5minutes earlier 
than the no minal time po int, ensuring the pharmacokinet ic (PK)samples can be co llected on time.
For predose procedures, vital signs within 30minutes of dose, 12-lead ECG within 45minutes,

shoul d be perform ed before clinical laboratory  and PK blood sam ples are collected.
3 INTRODUCTION
Factor Xa (FXa) plays a pivotal role in the coagulation cascade at the junction of the intrinsic and 
extrinsic pathways of the coagulation system. Inhibit ion of FXa is expected to exert anticoagulant  
and antithrombotic effects by decreasing the conversio n of prothrombin to active thrombin, 
thereby diminishing thrombin -mediat ed activat ion of the coagul ation process, including fibrin 
formation and platel et activat ion. Apixaban is an orally  active, select ive, reversible inhibitor of 
FXa and is approved for prevent ion of venous thromboembo lism in pat ients who have undergone 
elective knee or hip replacement surgery ,for stroke prevent ion in nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, 
and for treatment of venous thromboembo lism and prevention of recurrent venous 
thromboembo lism [USPI1and SmPC2].

3.3 Benefit/Risk Assessment
Since this is not an efficacy treatm ent study , there is no direct benefit to the participants 
participat ing in this study  other than contribut ing to the research of a product.
The potential risk to participants fro m apixaban in this study is expected to be minimal. Approved 
apixaban doses are 2.5 mg twice daily (BID) in venous thromboembo lism prevent ion in o rthopedic 
patients, 5 mg BID in atrial fibrillat ion, and 10 mg BID for 7 days fo llowed by 5 mg BID in venous 
thromboembo lismtreatm ent. In healt hy participant s, single and mult iple oral d oses of apixaban up 
to 25 mg BID for 7 day s and 50 mg once daily for 3days were well-tolerated. In this study, single 
2.5-mg doses of apixaban will be administered under medical supervisio n; each single dose will 
be separated by a washout period of at least 4days. To ensure safet y, participants with potential 
risk factors for bleedi ng will be excluded; this includes any history  or evidence of abnormal 
bleeding or coagulat ion disorders, intracranial hemorrhage, or abnormal bleeding or coagulat ion 
disorders in a first degree relat ive.
Apixaban did not direct ly impair fertilit y or early embry onic devel opment in rats and was not 
teratogenic in mice, rats, or rabbits at area under the concentration -time curve (AUC ) multip les 
≤6.9 × the human AUC at 20 mg (10 mg BID). However, the reproductive risk of apixaban has 
not been evaluated in humans. Therefore, women of childbearing potenti al (WOCBP) who are 
unwilling or unable to use an acceptable method of contraception (Appendix 4) to avoid pregnanc y 
for at least 4 weeks prior to dosing, during the study , and 33 days after the last dose of study 
treatm ent in such a manner that the ri sk of  pregnancy is minimized will be excluded. In addi tion, 
male participants must agree to use an acceptable method of contraception d uring the ent ire study 
and for 9 3 days after the last dose. Male part icipants mus t not donate sperm d uring the ent ire study 
and for 9 3 days after the last dose.

5 STUDY DESIGN
5.1 Overall Design
This is a Phase 1,open -label, rando mized, 2-period, 2-treatm entcrossover study  in healthy 
participants .Healthy male or female participants as determined by medical history , physica l 
examinat ion, vital signs, 12-lead ECG, and clinical laboratory  tests will be eligible to parti cipate 
in the study . Parti cipants will undergo screening evaluations to determine eligibili ty within 28 da ys 
prior to study  treatm ent administrati on. On Day  -1, participants will enter the clinical facilit y and 
be confined for the durati on of the study , until discharge on Day 8. Prior to dosing on Day 1 of 
Period 1, parti cipants will be randomly assign ed to 1 of 2 treatm ent sequences (AB or BA , where 
Treatment A is 5 ×0.5-mg apixaban tablets and Treatment B is 25 × 0.1-mg apixaban sprinkle 
capsules )in a 1:1 ratio. Participants will receive a single oral dose of  apixaban on Days 1 and 5. 
There will be a 4-day washout period between doses. Treatment s A and B will be prepared in the 
pharmacy.
The study  design schemat ic is presented in Figure 5.1 -1.

Loss of ability to freely  provide consent through imprisonment or involuntarily incarceration 
for treatm ent of either a psychiatric or physical (eg, infect ious disease) illness . (Note: Under 
specific circumstances, a participant who has been imprisoned may be permi tted to c ontinue 
as a parti cipant. Strict condi tions apply and BMS approval is required.)
Inabilit y to com ply wi th protocol
Discreti on of  the invest igator
Discontinuati on of the study treatm ent for abnorm al liver tests should be considered by the 
investigator when a participant meets one of the condi tions outlined in Secti on 9.2.7 ,or if the 
investigator believes that it is in best interest of the participant.
Refer to the Schedule o f Activit ies for data to be collected at the time o f treatment discont inuat ion 
and fo llow-up and for any  further evaluat ions that can be co mpleted (Section 2).
In the case of pregnancy, the invest igator must immediately notify the BMS Medical 
Moni tor/desi gnee of this event. In the event a normal healt hy female partici pant beco mes pregnant 
during a clinical trial, the study  treatm entmust be discont inued immediately . In most cases, the 
study  treatment will be perm anently  discont inued in anappropri ate manner (eg, dose tapering if 
necessary  for participant safet y). Please call the BMS Medical Moni tor within 24hours of 
awareness of the pregnancy . If the invest igator determines a possible favorable benefit/risk ratio 
that warrants continuat ion of study  treatm ent, a di scussio n between the invest igator and the BMS 
Medical Monitor/designee must occur.
All participant s who discont inue study  treatm entshould comply with protocol specified fo llow-up 
procedures as outlined in Sect ion 2. The only  excepti on to this requi rement is when a participant
withdraws consent for all study  procedures including post -treatm ent study  follow-up or loses the 
abilit y to consent freely  (ie, is imprisoned or invo luntarily incarcerated for the treatment of either 
a psy chiatri c or phy sical illness).
If study  treatm entis discontinued prior to the participant ’s co mpletion of the study , the reason for 
the discont inuat ion must be docum ented in the participant ’s medical records and entered on the 
appropriate CRF page.
8.1.1 Post Study Treatment Study Follow -up
Parti cipants who di scontinue study  treatm ent m ay continue to be fo llowed.
8.2 Discontinuation from the Study

In the event that vital status (whether the participant is alive or dead) is being measured, 
publicly  available informat ion shoul d be used to determine vital status only as appropri ately 
directed in accordance wi th local law.
If the partici pant withdraws consent for disclos ure of future informat ion, the Sponsor may 
retain and cont inue to use any data collected befor e such a withdrawal o f consent.
8.3 Lost to Follow -Up
All reasonable efforts must be made to locate participant s to determine and report their ongoing 
status. This includes fo llow-up wi th persons authorized by  the participant .
Lost to follow -up is defined by  the inabili ty to reach the participant after a minimum  of three
docum ented phone calls, faxes, or emails as well as lack of response by participant to one 
registered m ail letter. All attempts should be documented in the participant’s medical records.
If it is determined that the participant has died, the site will use permissible local methods to 
obtain date and cause of death.
If invest igator’s use o f third-party  representative to assist in the fo llow-up porti on of the study 
has been included in the partici pant’s informed consent, then the investigator may use a 
Sponsor retained third-party  representative to assist site staff with obtaining participant’s 
contact information or other public vital status data necessary to complete the follow-up 
porti on of  the study . 
The si te staff  and representative will consul t publicly available sources, suc h as public healt h 
registries and databases, in order to obta in updated contact information.
If after all attempts, the participant remains lost to fo llow-up, then the last known alive date as 
determined by the invest igator should be reported and documented in the participant’s medical 
records.
9 STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES
Study  procedures and timing are summarized in the S chedule of Activities(Secti on 2) . 
Protocol  waivers or exempt ions are not allowed .
All immediate safet y concerns must bediscussed with the Sponsor immediately upon 
occurrence or awareness to determine if the participant should continue or discontinue 
treatm ent.
Adherence to the study  design requi rements, including those specified in the Schedule of 
Activities, is essenti al and requi red for study  conduct.
All screening evaluat ions must be completed and reviewed to confirm that potential 
participants m eet all eligibilit y criteria before randomizat ion. The invest igator will maintain a 
screening log to record details of all participants screened and to c onfirm eligibili ty or record 
reasons for scr eening failure, as applicable.
Procedures conducted as part of the participant’s routine clinical management (eg,blood 
count) and obtained before signing of inform ed consent may be utilized for screening or 
baseline purposes provided the procedure meets the protocol -defined criteria and has been

9.2 Adverse Events
The definit ions of an AE or SAE can be found in Appendix 3.
AEs will be reported by the participant (or, when appropriate, by a caregiver, surrogate, or the 
participant's legally  authori zed representative). 
The invest igator and any designees are responsible for detecting, docum enting, and reporting 
events that meet the definit ion of an AE or SAE and remain responsible for following up AEs that 
are serious, considered related to the study treatment or the study, or that caused the participant to 
discontinue before complet ing the study. 
Contacts for SAE reporting specified in Appendix 3
9.2.1 Time Period and Frequency for Collecting AE and SAE Information
The collection o f nonseri ous AE information should begin at init iation of study treatment until the 
time points specified in the Schedule o f Activities (Section 2). Nonserious AE informat ion should 
also be collected from  the start of a pl acebo lead -in period or other observat ional period intended 
to establish a baseline status for the participant s.
Secti ons 5.6.1 and 5.6.2 in the IB represent the Reference Safet y Inform ation to determine 
expectedness of SAEs for expedited reporting. Followin g the participant’s written consent to 
participate in the study , all SAEs, whether rel ated or not rel ated to study  drug, m ust be collected, 
including those thought to be associated with protocol -specified procedures.
All SAEs must be collected that occur during the screening period and within 30 days of 
discontinuat ion of dosing.
The investigator must report any SAE that occurs af ter these time periods and that is believed to 
be related to study  drug or protocol -specified procedure.
Medical occurrences that begin before the start of study treatment but after obtaining informed 
consent will be recorded on the appropriate section of the CRF section.
All SAEs will be recorded and reported to Sponsor or designee within 24 hours, as indicated 
in Appendix 3. 
The invest igator will submit any updated SAE data to the Sponsor within 24 hours of this being 
available.
Invest igators are not obligated to actively seek AEs or SAEs in former study  participants. 
However, if the invest igator learns of any SAE, including adeath, at any time after a participant 
has been discharged fro m the study, and he/she considers the event reasonably related to the study 
treatm ent or study  parti cipat ion, the invest igator must prompt ly notify the S ponsor.
The method of evaluat ing, and assessing causality  of AEs and SAEs and the procedures for 
completing and reporting/ transmi tting SAE reports are provided in Appendix 3.

9.2.2 Method of Detecting AEs and SAEs
Adverse events can be spontaneously reported or elicited during open -ended quest ioning, 
examinat ion, or evaluation of a participant . Care shoul d be taken not to introduce bias when 
collect ing AE and/or SAEs. Inquiry about specific AEs should be guided by clinical judgement in 
the context of known AE s, when appropriate for the program or proto col.
9.2.3 Follow -up of AEs and SAEs
Nonserious AEs shoul d be followed to resol ution or stabilizat ion, or reported as SAEs if t hey 
beco me serious (see Appendix 3).
Follow-up is also requi red for nonserious AEs that cause interruption or discont inuation of 
study  treatm ent and for those present at the end of study  treatm ent as appropri ate.
 All ident ified nonseri ous AEs must be recorded and described on the nonseri ous AE page of 
the CRF (paper or electronic). Com pletion of supplemental  CRFs may be requested for AEs
and/or laboratory  abnorm alities that are reported/ident ified during the course of the study .
All SAEs will be followed until resolution, until the condi tion stabilizes, until the event is 
otherwi se explained, or until the participant is lost to fo llow-up (as defined in Section 8.3).
Further informat ion on fo llow-up procedures i s given in Appendix 3.
9.2.4 Regulatory Reporting Requirements for SAEs
Prom pt notificat ion by the invest igator to the Sponsor of SAEs is essent ial sothat legal 
obligat ions and ethical responsibilit ies towards the safet y of participants and the safet y of a 
product under clinical investigation are met.
An invest igator who receives an invest igator safety report describing SAEs or other specific 
safet y information (eg, summary  or listing of SAEs) from the Sponsor will file it along with 
the IBand will notify the Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics Committee , if 
appropriate according to local requirements.
Sponsor or designee will be reporting AEs to regul atory  authori ties and ethics committees 
according to local applicable laws including European Direct ive 2001/20/EC and US Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA )Title 21 of the Code of Federal  Regulat ions, Parts 312 and 320. A 
SUSAR (Suspected, Unexp ected Serious Adverse Reaction) is a subset of SAEs and will be 
reported to the appropriate regulatory  authori ties and invest igators following local and global 
guidelines and requirements.
9.2.5 Pregnancy
If, following initiation of the study  treatm ent, it is subsequent ly discovered that a participant is 
pregnant or may have been pregnant at the time of study exposure, including during at least 
5half-lives after product administration, the investigator must immediately notify the BMS 
Medical Monitor/designee of this event and complete and forward a Pregnancy Surveillance Form 
to BMS Designee within 24 hours of awareness of the event and in accordance with SAE reporting 
procedures described in Appendix 3.

9.2.6 Laboratory Test Result Abnormalities
The following laboratory  test resul t abnorm alities shoul d be captured on the nonseri ous AE CRF 
page or SAE Report Form  electronic ,as appropri ate. Paper f orms are only intended as a back-up 
option when the e lectronic system is not functioning.
Any laboratory  test resul t that is clinically significant or meets the definit ion of an SAE 
Any laboratory  test resul t abnormalit y that required the participant to have study  treatm ent
discontinued or interrupted
Any laboratory  test resul t abnormalit y that required the participant to receive specific 
corrective therapy
It is expected that wherever possible, the clinical rather than laboratory term would be used by the 
reporting invest igator ( eg, anemia versus low h emogl obin value).
9.2.7 Potential Drug -Induced Liver Injury (DILI)
Wherever possible, timely confi rmation of initial liver-related laboratory  abnormalit ies shoul d 
occur pri or to the reporti ng of  a potenti al drug-induced liver injury ( DILI )event. All occurrences
of potenti al DILIs, meet ing the defined criteria, must be reported as SAEs (see Section 9.2and 
Appendix 3 for reporting details).
Potential DILI is defined as: 
1)Aminotransaminases (ALT or AST) el evation > 3 times ULN
AND
2)Total  bilirubin > 2 times ULN, wit hout init ial findings o f cholestasis (elevated serum alkaline 
phosphatase),
AND
3)No other immediatel y apparent possible causes of aminotransaminases elevat ion and 
hyperbilirubinemia, including, but not limited to, viral hepat itis, pre-exist ing chroni c or acute 
liver di sease, or the administration of other drug(s) known to be hepatotoxic.

9.2.8 Other Safety Considerations
Any significant worsening noted during interim or final physical examinat ions, 12-lead ECG s, 
X-ray filming, any other potenti al safet y assessment required or not requi red by protocol  should 
also be recorded as a nonserious or serious AE, as appropriate, and reported accordi ngly.
9.3 Overdose
An overdose is defined as the accidental or intent ional administration of any dose of a product that 
is considered both excessive and medically important. All occurrences of overdose must be 
reported as an SAE (see Section 9.2).
For this study , any dose ofapixaban greater than 2.5 mg within a 24-hour time period will be 
considered an overdose.
9.4 Safety
Planned time po ints for all safet y assessments are listed in the Schedule of Act ivities(Secti on 2).
Only data for the procedures and assessments specifie d in this protocol  should be submi tted to

9.8.1 Additional Research Collection
This protocol  will include residual sample stor age for addit ional research .
Addit ional research is required for all study parti cipants, except where prohibit ed by IRBs/ethics 
committees , or acade mic/inst itutional requirements. Where one or more of these except ions 
occurs, participat ion in the addit ional research should be encouraged but will not be a condit ion of 
overall study  parti cipat ion.
If the IRB/ethics committees and site agree to the mandatory  additional research retenti on 
and/or collection, then the study participant must agree to th e mandatory  additional research 
as a requi rement for inclusi on in the study .
If optional parti cipat ion is permitted and approved, then the study  parti cipants m ay opt out of 
the addi tional research retent ion and/or collect ion.
This collection for additional research is intended to expand the transl ational R&D capabilit y at 
BMS , and will support as yet undefined research aims that will advance our understanding of 
disease and options for treatm ent. It may also be used to support health authori ty requests for 
analysis, and advancement of pharm acodiagnosti c development to better targe t drugs to the ri ght 
patients. This may also include genet ic/geno mic exploration aimed at exploring disease pathways, 
progression and response to treatm ent etc. 
Sample Collection and Storage
All requests for access to sam ples or data f or addi tional research will be vetted through a diverse 
committee of the study  Sponsor’s senior leaders in Research and Devel opment (or designee) to 
ensure the res earch supports appropriate and well -defined scient ific research activit ies.
Residual plasma from PK collect ions (Table 9.8.1 -1) will  also be retained for addi tional research 
purposes .
 
The manager of  these samples will  ensure they  are properly used throughout their usable life and 
will destroy  the samples at the end of the scheduled storage period, no longer than fifteen (15) 
years after the end of the study  or the maximum allowed by  applicable l aw.
Transfers of samples by research Sponsor to third parties will be subject to the recipient’s 
agreem ent to establish similar storage procedures.
 
 
Further details of sample collection and processing will be provi ded to th e site in the procedure 
manual .

10 STATISTICAL CONSIDER ATIONS
10.1 Sample Size Determination 
The sim ilarit y of the bioavailabilit ywill be concluded if the 90% confidence interval (CI) for the 
ratio of geometric means of apixaban 0.1-mgsprinkl ecapsules relative to apixaban 0.5-mg tablet s 
are wholly contained within 80% and 125% for Cmax and AUC . The following table shows the 
power provided with data from 28 PK evaluable participants based on different assumpt ions of 
differen ce between the bioavailabilit yof apixaban 0.1-mgsprinkle capsules and apixaban 0.5- mg 
tablets.

1.08 91% 99% 99% 89%
1.1 83% 99% 99% 81%
As an example, if there is a 10% differen ce between the bioavailabilit yof apixaban 0.1-mgsprinkle
capsules and apixaban 0.5-mg tablet s, then data from 28 PK evaluable partici pants will provide 
approximately  83%, 99%, and 99% power to concl ude simil ar bioavailabilit yfor Cmax, 
AUC(INF), and AUC(0 -T), respectively. The overall power for this hypothesis is approximately 
81%. 
These calculat ions use the approach described by Diletti  et al.6and assume Cmax and AUC are 
log norm ally distributed with intra-subject coefficient of variation (CV%) of 18% for Cmax and

SOURCE DOCUMENTS
The Investi gator is responsible for ensuring that the source data are accurate, legible, 
contemporaneous, ori ginal  and attributable, whether the data are hand -written on paper or entered 
electroni cally. If source data are created (first entered ), modified, m aintained, archived, retrieved, 
or transmitted electroni cally via computerized systems (and/or any other kind of electronic 
devices) as part of regulated clinical trial activities, such system s must be compliant with all 
applicable laws and regulati ons governing use of electronic records and/or electronic signatures. 
Such systems may include, but are not limited to, electronic medical/healt h records (EMRs/EHRs), 
adverse event tracking/reporting, protocol  required assessments, and/or drug accou ntabilit y 
records).
When paper records from such systems are used in place of electronic format to perform regulated 
activit ies, such paper records should be certified copies. A certified copy  consists of a copy of 
original  informat ion that has been verifi ed, as indicated by a dated signature, as an exact copy 
having all o f the sam e attri butes and informat ion as the original. 
STUDY TREATMENT RECO RDS
Records for study treatments (whether supplied by BMS, its vendors, or the site) must substant iate 
study  treatment integrity and traceabilit y from  receipt, preparation, administration, and through 
destruction or return. Records must be m ade available for revi ew at the request of BMS/desi gnee

EVALUATING, FOLLOW -UP, AND REPORTING
ADVERSE EVENTS
Adverse Event Definition:
An Adverse Event (AE) i s defined as any  new untoward m edical  occurrence or worsening of a 
preexist ing medical condit ion in a c linical invest igation partici pant administered study  treatm ent 
and that does not necessarily  have a causal  relati onship wi th this treatm ent. 
An AE can therefore be any unfavorable andunintended sign (such as an abnorm al laboratory 
finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use o f study treatment, whether or 
not consi dered rel ated to the study  treatment.

SERIOUS ADVERSE EVEN TS
Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any 
dose:
Results in death
Is life-threatening (defined as an event in which the parti cipant was at ri sk of  death at the time 
of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were 
more severe)
Requi res inpat ient hospitalization or causes prolongation of exist ing hospi talizat ion (see NOTE 
below)
NOTE: 
The fo llowing hospi talizati ons are not consi dered SAEs in BMS clinical studies: 
a visit to the emergency room  or other hospi tal departm ent < 24 hours, that does not resul t 
in admissio n (unless considered an important medical or life -threatening event)
elective surgery, planned prior to signing consent
admissio ns as per protocol for a planned medical/surgical procedure
routi ne health assessment requiring admissio n for baseline/trending of health status 
(eg,routine co lonoscopy )
medical/surgical admissio n other than to remedy ill healt h and planned prior to entry into 
the study . Appropri ate docum entati on is requi red in t hese cases
admissio n encountered for another life circumstance that carries no bearing on healt h status 
and requi res no medical/surgical interventi on (eg, lack of housing, economic inadequacy, 
caregiver respite, family circumstances, administrative reason)
admissio n for administration of anticancer therapy in the absence of any other SAEs (applies 
to oncology  protocol s)
Results in persistent or significant disabilit y/incapacit y
Is a congenital ano maly/birth defect
Is an important medical event (defined as a medi cal event(s) that may not be immediately 
life-threatening or result in death or hospitalizat ion but, based upon appropriate medical and 
scientific judgment, may jeopardi ze the participant or may require intervent ion [eg, medical, 
surgi cal] to prev ent one of the other seri ous outcomes listed in the definit ion above.) Examples 
of such events include, but are not limited to, intensive treatm ent in an emergency  room or at 
home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsio ns that do not resul t in 
hospi talizati on.) Potential drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is also considered an important 
medical event. (See Section 9.2.7 for the definit ion of potenti al DILI.)

Suspected transmissio n of an infect ious agent (eg, pathogenic or nonpathogenic) via the study 
treatm ent is an SAE. 
Although pregnancy, overdose, cancer, and potent ial drug-induced liver injury (DILI) are not 
always serious by regulatory  definit ion, these events must be handled as SAEs. (See Section 9.2.5 
for reporting pregnancies).
EVALUATING AES AND S AES
Assessment of Causality
The causal relat ionship to study treatment is determined by a physic ian and should be used 
to assess all adverse events (AE). Th e causal relat ionship can be one of the fo llowing:
Related: There is a reasonable causal  relationship between study  treatm ent 
administration and the AE.
Not related: There is not a reasonable causal relati onship between study  treatm ent 
administration and t he AE. 
The term "reasonable causal  relationship" means there is evidence to suggest a causal 
relationship. 
Follow -up of AEs and SAEs
If only limited information is initially available, follow-up reports are required. (Note: 
Follow-up SAE reports must include the same investigator term(s) init ially reported.) 
If an ongoing SAE changes in its intensit y or relationship to study treatm ent or if new 
inform ation becomes available, the SAE report must be updated and submitted within 
24hours to BMS (or designee) using the same procedure used for transmi tting the initial 
SAE report.
All SAEs must be fo llowed to resol ution or stabilization.

APPENDIX 4 WOMEN OF CHILDBEARIN G POTENTIAL DEFINITI ONS AND 
METHODS OF CONTRACEP TION
DEFINITIONS
Woman of Childbearing Potential (WOCBP)
A woman is considered fertile following menarche and until becoming post-menopausal unless 
perm anent ly sterile. Perm anent sterilizat ion methods include hysterectomy, bilateral 
salpingectomy , and bilateral  oophorectomy.
Women in the following categories are not considered WOCBP
Prem enarchal
Prem enopausal  female wi th 1 of the f ollowing:
Documented hysterectomy
Docum ented bilateral  salpingectomy
Docum ented bilateral  oophorectomy
Note: Docum entati on can come from the site personnel’s review of the partici pant’s medica l 
records, medical examinat ion, or m edical history  interview.
Postmenopausal  female
A postm enopausal  state is defined as 12 months of amenorrhea in a wom an over age 
45years in the absence of other biological or physi ological causes. In addition, females 
under the age of 55 years must have a serum  follicle stimulat ing horm one, (FSH) level 
> 40 mIU/mL to confirm menopause.
Note: Females treated with horm one replacement therapy, (HRT) are likely to have artificially 
suppressed FSH levels and may require a washout period in order to obtain a physi ologic FSH 
level. The durati on of the washout period is a function of the type of HRT used. The durati on of 
the washout period below are suggested guidelines and the invest igators should use their 
judgement in checking serum FSH levels. 
1 week minimum for vaginal hormonal produ cts (rings, creams, gels)
4 week minimum for transdermal products
8 week minimum for oral products
Other parenteral products may requi re washout periods as long as 6 months. If the serum  FSH 
level is > 40 mIU/ml at any time during the washout period, the wom an can be considered 
postm enopausal.

Vasectomized partner 
A vasectomized partner is a highly effective contraception method provided that the partner 
is the sole male sexual partner of the WOCBP and the absence of sperm has been confirmed. 
If not, an additional highly effective method of contraception should be u sed. 
Sexual abstinence
Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining from 
heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study treatment. 
The reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the 
study and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the participant.
It is not necessary to use any other method of contraception when complete abstinence is 
elected. 
WOCBP participants who choose complete abstinence must continue to have pregnancy 
tests, as specified in Section 2. 
Acceptable alternate methods of highly effective contraception must be discussed in the 
event that the WOCBP participants chooses to forego complete abst inence

NOTES: 
aTypical use failure rates may  differ from those when used consistently  and correctly . Use should be consistent 
with local regulations regarding the use of contraceptive methods for participants participating in clinical studies. 
bHormonal contraception may be susceptible to interaction with the study treatment, which may reduce the 
efficacy of the contraceptive method. Hormonal contraception is permissible only when there is sufficient 
evidence that the IMP and other study medications will not alter hormonal exposures such that contraception 
would be ineffective or result in increased exposures that could be potentially hazardous. In this case, alternative 
methods of contraception should be utilized. 
cIntrauterine devices and intrauterine hormone releasi ng sy stems are acceptable methods of contraception in the 
absence of definitive drug interaction studies when hormone exposures from intrauterine devices do not alter 
contraception effectiveness

Diagnostic Cri teria for Psychoactive Substance Dependence
A maladapt ive pattern of substance use, leading to clinically significant impairment or distress as 
manifested by  3 (or m ore) of the fo llowing, occurring at any  time in the same 12 -month peri od:
1.Tolerance, as defined by eit her of the f ollowing:
a)A need for markedly increased amounts of the substance to achieve intoxicat ion or desired 
effect,
b)Markedly diminished effect with continued use o f the sam e am ount of  the substance.
2.Withdrawal, as manifested by either of the fo llowing:
a)The charact eristic withdrawal syndro me for the substance,
b)The same (or closely related) substance is taken to relieve or avoid wit hdrawal symptoms.
3.The substance is o ften taken in larger amounts or over a longer period than was intended.
4.There i s a persistent desire or unsuccessful efforts to cut down or control substance use.
5.A great deal of time is spent in activit ies necessary to obtain the substance (eg,visiting mult iple 
doctors or driving long distances), use the substance (eg,chain -smoking) or recover from its
effects.
6.Important social, occupati onal or recreational activities are given up or reduced because of 
substance use.
7.The substance use is cont inued despite knowledge of having a persistent or recurring physical 
or psychological problem  that is likely  to have been caused or exacerbated by the substance 
(eg, current cocaine use despite recogni tion of cocaine -induced depressio n, or continued 
drinking despite recognit ion that an ulcer was made worse by alcoho l consumpt ion.)
Criteria for Severi ty of Psychoacti ve Substance Dependence
Mild: Few, if any, symptoms in excess o f those required to make the diagnosis, and the symptoms 
resul t in no m ore than mild impairment in occupational functioning or in usual social act ivities or 
relationships wit h others.
Moderate: Symptoms or funct ional impairment between “mild” and “severe”.
Severe: Many symptom s in excess of those required to make the diagnosis, and the symptoms 
markedly interfere with occupational funct ioning or with usual social activities or relationships 
withothers.
In Partial Remissio n: During the past 6 months, some use of the substance and so me symptoms o f 
dependence.
In Full Remissio n: During the past 6 months, either no use of the substance, or use of the substance 
and no symptoms of dependence.

househo ld).
2.Recurrent substance use in situations in which it is physically  hazardous (eg,driving an 
autom obile or operating a machine when impaired by  substance use).
3.Recurrent substance -related legal problems (eg, arrests for substance -related disorderly 
conduct).
4.Continued substance use despite having persistent or recurrent social or interpersonal 
probl ems caused or exacerbated by the effects of the substance (eg, arguments with spouse

Study Title  
A Phase 3, Multi -center, Randomized, Double -blind, Placebo -controlled Study to Assess the 
Efficacy and Safety of Apremilast (CC -10004) in Pediatric Subjects from 6 Through 17 Years of 
Age with Moderate to Severe Plaque Psoriasis  
Indication  
Psoriasis is a chronic, inflammatory skin disorder that is estimated to affect up to 2.5% of the 
world’s population ( Christophers, 2001 ). The worldwide prevalence of psoriasis in children 
ranges from 0% to 1.37%. European populations have a higher prevalence than African and 
Asian populations ( Michalek, 2017 ). The prevalence of psoriasis in children in the United States 
(US) from birth to age 18 years is 1%, with an incidence of 40.8 per 100,000 ( Tollefson, 2010 ). 
The most common form of the dise ase in both adults and children is plaque -type psoriasis that is 
characterized by erythematous plaques with silvery -white scales (Fan, 2007 ; Mallbris, 2005 ; 
Morris, 2 001; Lebwohl, 2003 ). The nails and scalp, less often, the mucous membranes may also 
be affected ( Weinstein, 2003 ). 
Most pediatric patients present with mild, localized psoriasis that can be treate d primarily with 
topical medications. Phototherapy is not recommended for fair -skinned or younger children, and 
psoralens with long -wave ultraviolet radiation (PUVA) is not recommended for use in pediatric 
psoriasis patients, due to the increased risk of m alignancies ( Ståhle, 2010 ). Due to this risk, 
phototherapy is usually reserved for older children and adolescents with extensive areas of 
involvement or refractory plaque disease ( Shah, 2013 ; Marqueling, 2013 ). Systemic medications 
are utilized for more extensive or refractory disease; however, approved therapies for moderate 
to severe psoriasis in children are limited.  As of 2017, the only approved systemic medicatio ns 
in the US for pediatric patients with this indication are the injection -delivered anti -tumor 
necrosis factor (anti -TNF) biologic agents, etanercept (Enbrel) and the anti -p40 inhibitor 
ustekinumab (Stelara). In the EU, etanercept (Enbrel), adalimumab (Hu mira), and ustekinumab 
(Stelara) are approved for pediatric use. Fear of needles is common in both children and adults 
and can contribute to negative experiences with needle procedures and health care for patients, 
caregivers, and health professionals ( McMurtry, 2016 ). Thus, there remains an unmet need for 
effective systemic therapies that offer oral convenient dosing and a favorable benefit/risk profile 
for the treatment of pediatric patients with moderate to severe plaque pso riasis.  
Apremilast is an oral selective phosphodiesterase type 4 (PDE4) inhibitor marketed worldwide 
under the trade name Otezla. Apremilast 30 mg twice per day (BID) received its first global 
marketing approval for the treatment of adult patients with moderate to  severe plaque psoriasis in 
2014. Clinical data from multiple Phase 2 and Phase 3 trials have consistently demonstrated that 
apremilast is an effective oral therapy with an acceptable safety profile for psoriasis. The safety 
profile of apremilast in the po st-marketing setting has remained consistent with that seen in the 
clinical development program. Thus, the benefit/risk profile of apremilast continues to be 
favorable in adult psoriasis patients.  
Moderate to severe plaque psoriasis also occurs in childre n and adolescents. Exploratory 
analyses from a recent Phase 2 study (CC -10004 -PPSO -001) indicate that apremilast may be 
effective for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in the pediatric population as in 
adults. This Phase 3 study  is being  conducted to evaluate the  safety and efficacy  of apremilast

Confidential and Proprietary  6 CC-10004 -PPSO -003 Amendment 5 Final : 17 Dec 2021 in the treat ment of pediatric subjects, ages 6 through 17 years, with moderate to severe plaque 
psoriasis.  
Objectives  
Primary Objective  
 The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the clini cal efficacy of apremilast 
compared with placebo in children and adolescents (ages 6 through 17 years) with 
moderate to severe plaque psoriasis.  
Secondary Objectives  
 To evaluate the safety and tolerability of apremilast compared with placebo, in children 
and adolescents (ages 6 through 17 years) with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis  
 To evaluate the effect of apremilast compared with placebo on health -related quality of 
life (HRQoL).  
Study Design  
This is a multicenter, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled efficacy and safety study.  
The study will be conducted in compliance with International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) 
Good Clinical Practices (GCPs).  
At least 230 pediatric subjects (ages from 6 through 17 years) will be randomized 2:1 to receive 
either apremilast or placebo for the first 16 weeks. Randomization to the apremilast arm or the 
placebo arm will be stratified by baseline age group (6 to 11 years or 12 to 17 years). A 
minimum of 75 subjects will be randomized in each age group. The sponsor may halt enrollment 
of one age group if that age group reaches 155 randomized subjects to allow the other group to 
randomize at least 75 subjects. Treatment will be assigned by weight with subjects 20 kg to 
< 50 kg receiving apremilast 20 mg BID or placebo BID and subjects ≥ 50 kg receiving 
apremilast 30 mg BID or placebo BID. After all subjects have completed Week 16 (Visit 7), or 
discontinued from the study, a Week 16 database lock will be performed; the primary data 
analysis will be conducted and a Week 16 clinical study re port will be generated. Study 
investigators and subjects will remain blinded to initial treatment assignments until the final 
database lock at the conclusion of the study. The blind also should be maintained for persons 
responsible for the ongoing conduct of the study. Blinded persons may include but are not 
limited to: clinical research physician, clinical research scientist, clinical trial manager, study 
statistician, data manager, programmer, and clinical research associate. At the end of the study, 
after all subjects have either completed Week 52 (Visit 16) and entered the Long -term Study, or 
completed the Observational Follow -up Phase, or been discontinued from the Apremilast 
Extension Phase (Weeks 16 to 52) or the Observational Follow -up Phase, a final  analysis will be 
performed and a final clinical study report will be generated.  
The study will consist of four phases:  
 Screening  Phase  – up to 35 da ys 
 Placeb o-controlled Treatment Phase  – Weeks  0 to 16 
 Subjects will be randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to  weight -based apremilast or 
placebo.  Subjects 20 kg to < 50 kg will receive apremilast 20 mg BID or placebo

Protocol CC -10004 -PPSO -003  Amgen Inc.  
Confidential and Proprietary  7 CC-10004 -PPSO -003 Amendment 5 Final : 17 Dec 2021 BID and subjects ≥ 50 kg will receive apremilast 30 mg BID or placebo BID. The 
primary endpoint will be the proportion of subjects with a Static Ph ysician Global 
Assessment (sPGA) score of clear (0) or almost clear (1) with at least a 2 -point 
reduction from baseline at Week 16.  
 From Week 8 through Week 16, any subject with a Psoriasis Area Severity Index 
(PASI) increase ≥ 50% from baseline will be el igible to commence treatment with 
moderate -to-high potency topical steroid preparations (early escape) and continue 
with randomized investigational product (IP).  
 Apremilast Extension Phase  – Weeks  16 to 52 
Placebo subjects will be switched at Week 16 to receive apremilast 20 mg BID or 
30 mg BID, according to baseline weight. All other subjects will continue to 
receive either apremilast 20 mg BID or apremilast 30 mg BID based on their 
original dosing assignment .   
 Observational Follow -up Phase – 14 weeks  
All eligible subjects who complete the Apremilast Extension Phase may opt to enroll 
in a separate Long -term Study (for up to 4 years or until approval, whichever comes 
first). Subjects who choose not to particip ate in the Long -term Study, or discontinue 
the study early, should return for observational follow -up visits four, eight and 
fourteen weeks after the last dose of IP.  
Study Population  
Pediatric subjects, ages 6 through 17 years, weighing at least 20 kg, wi th moderate to severe 
plaque psoriasis defined by:  
 PASI score ≥ 12; and  
 Body surface area ≥ 10%; and  
 sPGA ≥ 3 (moderate to severe)  
Subjects must have diagnosis of chronic plaque psoriasis for at least 6 months prior to Screening.  
Length of Study  
The study will have a total duration of up to 71 weeks and will consist of four phases.  
 Screening Phase – up to 35 days (5 weeks)  
 Placebo -controlled Treatment Phase – Weeks 0 to 16  
 Apremilast Extension Phase  – Weeks 16 to 52  
 Observational Follow -up Phase – 14 weeks (subjects continuing in the Long -term Study 
will not complete this phase)  
The End of Trial is defined as either the date of the last visit of the last subject to complete the 
post-treatment follow -up, or the date of receipt of the last data point from the last subject that is 
required for primary, secondary and/or exploratory analysis, as prespecified in the protocol, 
whichever is the later date.

Confidential and Proprietary  8 CC-10004 -PPSO -003 Amendment 5 Final : 17 Dec 2021 Study Treatments  
Investigational product (IP) will be provided in blister cards throughout the Placebo -controlled 
Treatment Phase as well as the first month of the Apremilast Extension Phase. Apremilast blister 
cards provided by the sponsor, Amgen Inc., will contain 10, 20, and 30 mg tablets, depending on 
baseline weight. Placebo will be provided as  identically appearing 10, 20, and 30 mg tablets. 
After completion of the Apremilast Extension Phase titration period, IP will be distributed in 
bottles containing 20 or 30 mg tablets for the remainder of the study. All IP will be taken orally 
twice daily,  approximately 12 hours apart, without restriction of food or drink. To reduce 
potential gastrointestinal (GI) side effects, dose titration will be implemented during Week 0 of 
this study and at Week 16.  
During Week 0 (Days 1 to 7), subjects will be dispen sed dose titration blister cards with 10, 20, 
and 30 mg apremilast tablets or identically appearing placebo tablets. The blister cards will 
contain all IP required for 4 weeks of treatment. Titration supplies or matching placebo will be 
dispensed over the first 3 days for the 20 mg BID treatment group, and over the first 5 days for 
the 30 mg BID treatment group (see Table  5: Treatment Schema for Dose Titration at Visit 2 
[Week 0]) which details the titration supplies from Day 1 to Day 3 or Day 1 to Day 5 in the 
Placebo -controlled Treatment Phase. IP will be dispensed as indicated below:  
 Weeks 0 to  16 (Placebo -controlled Treatment Phase): Apremilast 20 mg BID or 
apremilast 30 mg BID or placebo BID.  
 Week 0: subjects will be dose titrated as described above and in Table  5. 
 Weeks 16 to 52 ( Apremilast Extension Phase ): Apremilast 20 mg BID or 30  mg BID 
 Week 16: subjects will be dose titrated as described in Table  6. 
At Visit 2 (Week 0), subjects who meet entry criteria will be randomized using a permuted 
block, randomization in parallel 2:1 to receive either apremilast or placebo treatment, using a 
centralized Interactive Response Technology (IRT). Randomization to the apremilast arm or the 
placeb o arm will be stratified by baseline age group (6 to 11 years or 12 to 17 years). Subjects 
with baseline weight between 20 kg to < 50 kg will receive apremilast 20 mg BID or placebo 
BID and subjects with baseline weight ≥ 50 kg will receive apremilast 30 m g BID or placebo 
BID.  
At Week 16, subjects who were originally randomized to placebo at Week 0 will be switched to 
receive apremilast treatment, where dose levels (either 20 mg BID or 30 mg BID) would have 
been determined at Week 0 using their baseline we ight categories (20 kg to < 50 kg, or ≥  50 kg). 
Subjects randomized to the apremilast arm at Week 0 will remain on their assigned dose levels 
(either 20 mg BID or 30 mg BID).  
During Weeks 16 to 52, study investigators and study subjects will remain blinde d to the initial 
IP assignments. To maintain the blind, all subjects will receive dose titration cards at the 
Week  16 visit. Although only subjects initially randomized to placebo will be dose titrated 
during their first week of the Apremilast Extension Ph ase, all subjects entering the Apremilast 
Extension Phase will receive identically -appearing titration/treatment cards (see Table  6).

Protocol CC -10004 -PPSO -003  Amgen Inc.  
Confidential and Proprietary  10 CC-10004 -PPSO -003 Amendment 5 Final : 17 Dec 2021 Statistical Methods  
At least 230 pediatric subjects (ages from 6 through 17) will be randomized to receive either 
apremilast or placebo (2:1) at Week 0. The sample size estimation is based on the results of the 
adult Phase 3 and 3b studies with apremilast (CC -10004 -PSOR -008, PSOR -009 and PSOR -010) 
which demonstrated positive treatment effects between apremilast and placebo in the proportion 
of subj ects achieving sPGA response and PASI -75 response at Week 16.  
With a total of 230 patients and a randomization ratio of 2:1, the study will have 90% power to 
detect a 15% difference (20% versus 5%) between the apremilast arm and the placebo arm for 
the pro portion of subjects achieving sPGA response at Week 16, based on a Chi -square test at a 
two-sided significance level of 0.05. The study will also have more than 95 % power to detect a 
20% difference (30% versus 10%) between apremilast and placebo for the pr oportion of subjects 
achieving PASI -75 response at Week 16.  
Analysis for efficacy endpoints will be mainly using the intent -to-treat (ITT) population, defined 
as all randomized subjects. Statistical comparisons will be made between the apremilast arm and 
the placebo arm. All statistical tests will be at the two -sided 0.05 significance level and the 
corresponding p -values and two -sided 95% confidence intervals (CIs) will be reported.  
To maintain an overall family -wise Type I error rate at the two -sided 0.05 significance level, a 
fixed -sequence testing procedure will be used to test the primary and the major secondary 
endpoints in a predefined order. The primary endpoint (sPGA response at Week 16) will be 
tested first at the two -sided 0.05 significance level. The comparison with respect to the major 
secondary endpoint (PASI -75 response at Week 16) will be conducted conditional on the test 
result of the primary endpoint, where statistical significanc e will be claimed only if the two -sided 
p-values for both endpoints are below 0.05.  
The primary endpoint, the proportion of subjects who achieve sPGA response at Week 16 for 
apremilast versus placebo will be compared using Cochran –Mantel –Haenszel (CMH) te st 
adjusted by stratification factor at randomization. Subjects who terminate early due to lack of 
efficacy or add moderate -to-high potency topical steroid preparations (early escape) or other 
protocol prohibited medications prior to Week 16 will be assign ed as non -responders. Missing 
values will be imputed using the multiple imputation (MI) method as the primary analysis. 
Sensitivity analyses will be performed using the last observation carried forward (LOCF) 
method, the non -responder imputation (NRI) meth od and the tipping point analyses. A sensitivity 
analysis using the PP population will also be performed. The major secondary endpoint and other 
binary secondary efficacy endpoints will be analyzed similarly as the primary endpoint.  
Subgroup analyses for t he primary and the major secondary endpoints based upon demographics 
(age, gender, race, weight category, etc.) and baseline characteristics will be provided to 
determine the robustness of the treatment effect.  
The analysis for the continuous secondary end points will be performed using the analysis of 
covariance (ANCOVA) model. The ANCOVA model will use the change or percent change 
from baseline as the dependent variable and will include treatment group and stratification 
factors as independent variables an d the baseline value as a covariate variable. The treatment 
comparison between apremilast and placebo will be conducted. Missing values will be imputed 
using the (MI) method.

received at least one dose of IP. Safety will be assessed by clinical review of all relevant 
parameters including treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs), laboratory tests and vital 
signs. Data from safety assessments will be summarized des criptively for the Placebo -controlled 
Treatment Phase (Weeks 0 to 16) and the Apremilast Exposure Period when subjects receive 
apremilast treatment. Adverse events will be classified using the Medical Dictionary for 
Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) classific ation system. All TEAEs will be summarized by 
system organ class, preferred term, severity, and relationship to IP. TEAEs leading to death or to 
IP withdrawal and serious TEAEs will also be summarized and listed separately.

Confidential and Proprietary  18 CC-10004 -PPSO -003 Amendment 5 Final : 17 Dec 2021 1. INTRODUCTION   
1.1. Disease Background  
Psoriasis is a chronic, inflammatory skin disorder that is estimated to affect up to 2.5% of the 
world’s population ( Christophers, 2001 ). The worldwide prevalence of psoriasis in children 
ranges from 0% to 1.37%. European populations have a higher prevalence than  African and 
Asian populations ( Michalek, 2017 ). The prevalence of psoriasis in children in the United States 
(US) from birth to age 18 years is 1%, with an incidence of 40.8 per 100,000 ( Tollefso n, 2010 ). 
The first manifestation of psoriasis may occur at any age, with approximately one -third of cases 
reporting onset during childhood ( Ståhle, 2010 ; Silverberg, 2010 ). Regardless of the timi ng of 
disease onset, the most common form of the disease in both adults and children is plaque -type 
psoriasis, characterized by erythematous plaques with silvery -white scales ( Bronckers, 2015 ; 
Silverberg, 2010 ; Fan, 2007 ; Mallbris, 2005 ; Morris, 2001 ; Lebwohl, 2003 ). The nails and, less 
often, the mucous membranes may also be affected ( Weinstein, 2003 ). One-third of patients 
present with the first signs and symptoms of psoriasis by the age of 20 years. (Tollefson, 2010 ; 
Benoit, 2007 ; Raychaudhuri, 2001 ). 
1.2. Compound Background  
Apremilast (CC -10004) is a specific phosphodiesterase type 4 (PDE4) inhibitor under 
development for use in the treatment of inflammatory conditions. PDE4 is one of the major 
phosphodiestera ses expressed in leukocytes. PDE4 inhibition by apremilast elevates cyclic 
adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels in immune cells, which in turn down -regulates the 
inflammatory response by reducing the expression of pro -inflammatory cytokines, and 
increasin g the production of anti -inflammatory mediators.  
In completed Phase 3 studies in subjects with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis and active 
psoriatic arthritis, treatment with apremilast was associated with statistically significant and 
clinically meani ngful improvements in multiple efficacy measures. On the basis of these studies, 
apremilast (OTEZLA®) is approved in multiple countries worldwide for the treatment of patients 
with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis who are candidates for phototherapy or systemic 
therapy, and the treatment of adult patients with active psoriatic arthritis.  
Apremilast remains under further clinical development for the treatment of 
inflammatory/autoimmune disorders including Behçet’s disease, and ulcerative colitis. Further  
studies within the approved indications of plaque psoriasis are also ongoing.  
Please refer to the Investigator’s Brochure (IB) for detailed information concerning the available 
pharmacology, toxicology, drug metabolism, clinical studies, and adverse even t profile of the 
investigational product (IP).  
1.3. Rationale  
1.3.1.  Study Rationale and Purpose  
The treatment options for pediatric patients with plaque psoriasis remain limited. While most 
pediatric patients present with mild, localized psoriasis that can be treated  primarily with topical 
medications, these therapies may be limited by their short treatment durations, poor treatment 
compliance and significant adverse effects ( Chan, 2009 ; Kragballe, 2013 ). Phototherapy is not 

Apremilast  
Protocol CC -10004 -PPSO -003  Amgen Inc.  
Confidential and Proprietary  19 CC-10004 -PPSO -003 Amendment 5 Final : 17 Dec 2021 recommended for fair -skinned or younger children, and psoralens with long -wave ultraviolet 
radiation (PUVA) is not recommended for use in pediatric psoriasis patients, due to the increased 
risk of malignancies ( Ståhle, 2010 ). Due to this risk, phototherapy is usually reserved for older 
children and adolescents with extensive areas of involvement or refractory plaque disease ( Shah, 
2013 ; Marqueling, 2013 ).  
Systemic medications are utilized for more extensive or refractory disease; however, approved 
therapies for moderate to severe psoriasis in children is limited. Management of psoriasis in 
children can be challenging owing to a paucity of data and l ack of standardized guidelines to the 
pediatric population ( Vogel, 2012 ). As of 2017, the only approved systemic medications in the 
US for pediatric patients with this indication are the anti -TNF biologic agent etanercept (Enb rel), 
and the anti -p40 inhibitor ustekinumab (Stelara). In the European Union (EU), etanercept 
(Enbrel), adalimumab (Humira) and ustekinumab (Stelara) are approved for pediatric use. Fear 
of needles is common in both children and adults and can contribute to negative experiences with 
needle procedures and health care for patients, caregivers, and health professionals ( McMurtry, 
2016 ). Thus, there remains an unmet need for effective systemic therapies that offer oral 
convenient dosing and a favorable benefit/risk profile for the treatment of pediatric patients with 
moderate to severe plaque psoriasis.  
The systemic therapies used in pediatric psoriasis are essentially the same as those used in 
adulthood, with dosage and strength r eductions calculated based on age, weight, and available 
formulations ( Silverberg, 2010 ). However, most of these therapies are used off -label as they are 
not approved for pediatric use ( Ståhle, 20 10). In clinical trials, biologic therapies, etanercept 
(Enbrel), adalimumab (Humira), and ustekinumab (Stelara) demonstrated similar efficacy in 
pediatric patients with psoriasis as with the adult patients ( Dogra, 2018 ). 
Apre milast is an oral selective PDE4 inhibitor marketed worldwide under the trade name 
OTEZLA®.  Apremilast 30 mg twice per day (BID) received its first global marketing approval 
for the treatment of adult patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in 2 014. Clinical data 
from multiple Phase 2 and Phase 3 trials and in the post -marketing setting have consistently 
demonstrated that apremilast is an effective oral therapy with an acceptable safety profile in 
adults. Thus, the benefit/risk profile of apremil ast continues to be favorable in adult psoriasis 
patients.  
Moderate to severe plaque psoriasis also occurs in pediatric patients. Exploratory analyses from 
a recent Phase 2 study (CC -10004 -PPSO -001) indicate that apremilast may be effective for the 
treatm ent of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in the pediatric population as in adults. This 
Phase 3 stud y (CC-10004 -PPSO -003) is being conducted to evaluate the  safety and efficacy  of 
apremilast in the treatment of pediatric subjects, ages 6 through 17, with  moderate to severe 
plaque psoriasis.  
1.3.2.  Rationale for the Study Design  
This Phase 3, multi -center, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled study is designed to 
assess the efficacy and safety of apremilast in pediatric subjects aged 6 through 17 years of age 
with moderate to severe psoriasis.  
Study CC -10004 -PPSO -003 will investigate the safety and efficacy of apremilast 20 mg BID and 
apremilast 30 mg BID, compared to placebo, in the treatment of subjects with moderate to severe 

Apremilast  
Protocol CC -10004 -PPSO -003  Amgen Inc.  
Confidential and Proprietary  20 CC-10004 -PPSO -003 Amendment 5 Final : 17 Dec 2021 plaque psoriasis. The prima ry endpoint will be the proportion of subjects who achieve a static 
Physician Global Assessment (sPGA) of clear (0) or almost clear (1), with at least a 2 -point 
reduction from baseline at Week 16, in the intent -to-treat population. The first secondary 
endp oint will be the proportion of subjects achieving a 75% improvement in the Psoriasis Area 
Severity Index (PASI -75) response from baseline at Week 16. Both sPGA and PASI -75 have 
been required key endpoints for efficacy in psoriasis trials in both adults and  children with 
moderate to severe plaque psoriasis.   
The use of placebo for 16 weeks has been acceptable in clinical trials of pediatric subjects with 
moderate to severe plaque psoriasis ( Paller, 2008 ). To retain subjects in the study until the 
primary endpoint at Week 16 is reached, an early escape option for subjects demonstrating a 
worsening of their psoriasis, measured as a ≥ 50% increase in PASI score from baseline will be 
permitted. These early escape subjects will be al lowed to use moderate to high potency topical 
steroids but will be considered non -responders for the purposes of statistical analysis. The total 
treatment duration of the trial will be 52 weeks to assess the long -term effects of apremilast on 
safety and ma intenance of efficacy.  
Eligible subjects will be randomized 2:1 to receive either apremilast (20 mg BID for subjects 
weighing 20 to 50 kg, and 30 mg BID for subjects weighing ≥ 50 kg) or placebo, to reduce 
exposure to placebo without greatly increasing the  number of subjects exposed to investigational 
product, while maintaining the statistical power of the study. Randomization will be stratified by 
baseline age group to ensure balance between treatment arms with respect to baseline age.  
1.3.3.  Rationale for Dose, Schedule and Regimen Selection  
Two Phase 2 dose finding studies have been conducted in adult subjects with moderate to severe 
plaque psoriasis. In study CC -10004 -PSOR -005, a clear dose response was demonstrated with 
statistically significant improvement i n the apremilast 20 mg BID and 30 mg BID, but not the 
apremilast 10 mg BID treatment groups, compared with placebo. Similar findings were observed 
in Study CC -10004 -PSOR -011 which enrolled adult Japanese subjects with lower body weight 
and Body Mass Index (BMI) than the subjects enrolled in study CC -10004 -PSOR -005. The 
safety and tolerability profiles of the apremilast 20 mg BID and 30 mg BID treatment groups 
were acceptable with no clinically significant safety signals observed in either dose group. In 
both of these studies, the apremilast 30 mg BID treatment group provided a superior benefit/risk 
profile compared to apremilast 20 mg BID. The apremilast 30 mg BID dose was evaluated in 
two large pivotal Phase 3 studies (studies CC -10004 -PSOR -008 and CC -10004 -PSOR -009), and 
was subsequently approved for use in adult patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis.  
Moderate to severe plaque psoriasis also occurs in children and adolescents ages 6 through 
17 years.  The pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles of two effe ctive adult dosages, apremilast 20  mg 
BID and apremilast 30 mg BID, are being evaluated in the ongoing pediatric Phase 2 study 
CC-10004 -PPSO -001. The PK results from this study show that the apremilast exposure area 
under the plasma concentration -time curv e (AUCtau) and peak observed plasma concentration of 
drug (C max) on Day 14 in adolescents (12 to 17 years) treated with 30 mg BID, and children (6 to 
11 years) treated with 20 mg BID appear to be comparable to the exposure observed in adult 
patients treate d with 30 mg BID (Study CC -10004 PSOR -011). A population PK model was 
subsequently developed based on the data pooled from the pediatric study CC -10004 -PPSO -001, 
and the adult studies CC -10004 -PSOR -005 and CC -10004 -PSOR -011. The model -based

Protocol CC -10004 -PPSO -003  Amgen Inc.  
Confidential and Proprietary  21 CC-10004 -PPSO -003 Amendment 5 Final : 17 Dec 2021 simulations wer e conducted to determine the range of body weight in pediatric subjects taking 
apremilast 20 mg BID that could achieve similar exposure (AUCtau) to that in adult subjects 
taking the approved apremilast dose (30 mg BID). Two hundred clinical trials were sim ulated 
with each trial having pediatric subjects weighing between ≥ 20 kg and < 70 kg and adult 
reference population. The ratio of geometric mean (GM) of AUCtau for a given pediatric body 
weight group (body weight grouped by 5 kg increments) relative to th e GM of AUCtau in adults 
was computed and the median of ratio and its 90% predictive interval were summarized. Based 
on modeling and simulation, the exposure of apremilast 20 mg BID in pediatric subjects 
weighing between ≥ 20 kg and < 50 kg is predicted to  be similar to the exposure of apremilast 
30 mg BID in adults (median of ratio within 0.8 and 1.25). The pediatric subjects weighing 
≥ 50 kg are recommended to take the adult dose of 30 mg BID.  
Exploratory efficacy analysis indicates that both apremilast d oses (20 mg BID and 30  mg BID) 
may be efficacious in the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in pediatric subjects. 
The safety analyses showed a similar safety profile to that of adults but with higher incidence 
rates of adverse events, partic ularly of diarrhea, nausea and vomiting. These adverse events 
(AEs) were mostly mild to moderate, and of short duration with the majority of these AEs lasting 
< 3 days.  It should be noted that dose titration, which has been shown to ameliorate 
gastrointest inal-related adverse events in the adult studies, was not implemented in 
CC-10004 -PPSO -001.   
Based on these Phase 2 results, the Phase 3 study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of 
apremilast 20 mg BID for subjects < 50 kg and 30 mg BID for subjects ≥ 50 kg, compared to 
placebo, in the treatment of children and adolescent subjects with moderate to severe plaque 
psoriasis. As in the adult Phase 3 studies, dose titration will be implemented in order to mitigate 
potential gastrointestinal -related adverse e vents.  
1.3.4.  Rationale for Pharmacodynamics and Potential Predictive Biomarkers  
Phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) is the predominant cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) -
selective phosphodiesterase that regulates intracellular cAMP levels and gene expression in cell s 
of the immune system. PDE4 is highly overexpressed in the peripheral blood of a subset of 
psoriasis patients ( Schafer, 2016 ). Apremilast has been found to reduce Th17 and Th22 cytokine 
expression in the lesional skin and per ipheral blood of psoriasis patients ( Gottlieb, 2013 ; 
Krueger, 2016 ). In adult patients with moderate to severe psoriasis, treatment with apremilast is 
associated with significant reductions in pla sma levels of interleukin (IL) -17F, IL -17A, IL -22, 
and tumor necrosis factor -α (TNF -α) compared with placebo as early as Week 4; decreases in 
cytokine levels were sustained with continued treatment. Multivariate analyses demonstrated that 
while changes in IL-17F are the most important predictor of improvement in Psoriasis Area and 
Severity Index scores, apremilast exerts synergistic attenuating effects among a key group of 
cytokines involved in the pathology of psoriasis, and these effects correlate with im proved skin 
symptoms. These in vitro and clinical data demonstrate that the beneficial effects of apremilast 
on known inflammatory mediators are associated with its clinical efficacy. Peripheral blood will 
be drawn to measure RNA expression at baseline and  during the treatment period. Whole blood 
will be used for the analysis. The expression of specific RNAs, such as but not limited to 
PDE4A, PDE4B, PDE4C, PDE4D, IL17A, IL17F, IL22, and TNF -α, will be analyzed at baseline 
and during the placebo -controlled t reatment period. These data will further define the mechanism

are responding well to apremilast treatment.  
Psoriasis is driven in part by genetic factors, incl uding HLA -Cw6, TNF -α, LCE3B/3C, IL12B, 
IL23A, IL23R, LCE, TNIP1, IFHIH1, and NFKBIA. Apremilast has been shown to inhibit the 
expression of some of these genes, including TNF -α, IL12B, and IL23A ( Gottlieb, 2013 ). 
Therefore, cl inical response to apremilast may be dependent upon the underlying genetic drivers 
in some psoriasis patients. Pharmacogenetic testing will be conducted using deoxyribonucleic 
acid (DNA) isolated from a buccal swab at Visit 2 (Baseline Visit; day of random ization). DNA 
will be examined for the presence of polymorphisms in the genes encoding the targets of 
apremilast (PDE4A, PDE4B, PDE4C, and PDE4D), and in genes associated with psoriasis, 
including but not limited to HLA -Cw6, TNF -α, LCE3B/3C, IL12B, IL23A, IL23R, LCE, TNIP1, 
IFHIH1, and NFKBIA.  
The microbial species present on the skin of psoriasis patients may play a role in the transition 
from healthy skin to psoriatic plaques ( Langan 2017 ). The microbial composition of the patients’ 
skin will be examined to identify the predominant bacterial and fungal species present before and 
after apremilast treatment, to determine if the microbiome either predicts response to apremilast 
or changes upo n apremilast therapy.

3.1. Study Design  
This is a Phase 3,  multicenter, randomized, placebo -controlled, double -blind study of the 
efficacy and safety of apremilast (CC -10004) in pediatric subjects with moderate to severe 
plaque psoriasis.  
At least 230 pediatric subjects (ages 6 through 17 years) will be randomize d 2:1 to receive either 
apremilast or placebo for the first 16 weeks. Randomization to apremilast arm or placebo arm 
will be stratified by age group (6 to 11 years or 12 to 17 years). A minimum of 75 subjects will 
be randomized in each age group. The spons or may halt enrollment of one age group if that age 
group reaches 155 randomized subjects to allow the other group to randomize at least 
75 subjects. The integrated response technology (IRT) system will monitor total enrollment of 
each age group so enrollm ent can be halted once a group reaches 155 randomized subjects.  
Treatment will be assigned by weight with subjects 20 kg to < 50 kg receiving apremilast 20 mg 
BID or placebo BID and subjects ≥ 50 kg receiving apremilast 30 mg BID or placebo BID. After 
all subjects have completed the Week 16 Visit (or discontinued from the study), a Week 16 
database lock will be performed; the primary data analysis will be conducted and a Week 16 
clinical study report will be generated. Study investigators and subjects will remain blinded to 
initial treatment assignments until the final database lock at the conclusion of the study. The 
blind also should be maintained for persons responsible for the ongoing conduct of the study. 
Blinded persons may include but are not limited to: clinical research physician, clinical research 
scientist, clinical trial manager, study statistician, data manager, programmer, clinical research 
associate. At the end of the study, after all subjects have either completed Visit 16 and entered 
the Long -term Study, or completed the Observational Follow -up Phase, or been discontinued 
from the Apremilast Extension Phase (Weeks 16 to 52) or the Observational Follow -up Phase, a 
final analysis will be performed and a final clinical study report will be genera ted. 
The study will consist of four phases:  
 Screening Phase – up to 35 days  
 Placebo -controlled Treatment Phase – Weeks 0 to 16  
- Subjects will be randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to apremilast or placebo .  
Subjects 20 kg to < 50 kg will receive apremilast 20  mg BID or placebo BID and 
subjects ≥ 50 kg will receive apremilast 30 mg BID or placebo BID.  The primar y 
endp oint will be the proportion of subjects with an sPGA scor e of clear (0) or  
almos t clear (1 ) with at least a 2 -point reductio n from baseline  at Wee k 16. 
- From Week 8 through Week 16, any subject with a PASI increase ≥ 50% from 
baseline will be eligible to commence treatment with moderate -to-high potency 
topical steroid preparations (early escape) and continue with randomized IP.  
 Apremilast Extension P hase – Weeks 16 to 52  
- Placebo subjects will be switched at Week 16 to receive apremilast 20 mg BID or 
30 mg BID, according to baseline weight. All other subjects will continue to 
receive either apremilast 20 mg BID or apremilast 30 mg BID based on their 
original dosing assignment.

Protocol CC -10004 -PPSO -003  Amgen Inc.  
Confidential and Proprietary  28 CC-10004 -PPSO -003 Amendment 5 Final : 17 Dec 2021  Observational Follow -up Phase – 14 weeks  
- All eligible subjects who complete the apremilast Extension Phase may opt to 
enroll in a separate Long -term Study ( for up to 4 years or until approval, 
whichever comes first ). Subjects who choose not to participate in the Long -term 
Study, or discontinue the study early, should return for observational follow -up 
visits four, eight, and fourteen weeks after the last dose of IP.  
An external, independent data monitoring committee (DMC) will revi ew available safety and 
efficacy data approximately semi -annually or on an ad -hoc basis throughout the study. The DMC 
consists of 4 external independent members (3 independent clinical trialists and 1 independent 
biostatistician) with voting privileges. Al l members are selected by Amgen with consideration 
for their respective expertise in the subject matter and/or in their experience in convening or 
participating in a DMC.  
A Scientific Steering Committee (SSC) has also been formed in support of this study. The SSC 
provides input into the study protocol and is responsible for supporting the conduct of the trial, 
promoting effective enrollment and reviewing study data. The SSC is comprised of 5 clinicians 
that may or may not be participating in the study. The SSC will interact with Amgen and other 
parties on a periodic basis throughout the conduct of the trial with meetings based upon patient 
recruitment throughout the entire conduct of the trial.  
Treatment administration and schedule are discussed in Section  7.2. 
At this time, there are no consistent AEs or laboratory findings that would generally constitute a 
reliable stopping rule for this study. Subjects will be monitored for AEs, vital signs, and  
laboratory assessments at each study visit. All AEs, clinically significant changes in laboratory 
measures and clinically meaningful changes in vital signs will be recorded. Clinically 
meaningful changes that increase the risk to the subject, as assessed by the Investigator or 
Sponsor, may result in discontinuation of the subject from the study. Subjects who have psoriasis 
disease flare at any time during the period of the study and require additional psoriasis 
medication including systemic therapies such as methotrexate, systemic corticosteroids, or 
biologics, will be discontinued from the study and treated according to local treatment 
guidelines.  
The study will be conducted in compliance with the International Council for Harmonisation 
(ICH) of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use/Good 
Clinical Practice (GCP) and applicable regulatory requirements.

6.4. Efficacy Assessments  
The following assessments, when applicable, will be conducted as  outlined in the Table of 
Events, Section  5: 
 Static Physician Global Assessment (sPGA)  
The sPGA is the assessment by the Investigator of the overall disease severity at the time 
of evaluation. The sPGA is a 5 -point scale ranging from 0 (clear) to 4 (severe), 
incorporating an assessment of the severity of the three primary signs of the disease:  
erythema, scaling and plaque elevation. When making the assessment of overall severity, 
the Investigator should factor in areas that have already been cleared (ie, have scores of 0 
and not just evaluate remaining lesions for severity, ie, the severity of each sign is 
averaged across all areas of involvement, including cleared lesions.  
In the event of different severities across disease signs, the sign that is the predominant 
feature of the disease should be used to help determine the sPGA score. See detail s in 
Appendix B . 
 Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI)  
The PASI is a measure of psoriatic disease severity taking into account qualitative lesion 
characteristics (erythema, thickness, and scaling) and degree of skin surface area 
involvement on defined anatomical regions. The PASI is a validated instrument that has 
become standard in clinical trials for psoriasis.  
The PASI scores range from 0 to 72, with higher scores reflecting greater disease severity 
(Frederiksson, 1978 ). Erythema, thickness, and scaling are scored on a scale of 0 (none) 
to 4 (very severe) on 4 anatomic regions of the body: head, trunk, upper limbs, and lower 
limbs. Degree of involvement on each of the 4 anatomic regions is scored on  a scale of 0 
(no involvement) to 6 (90% to 100% involvement). The total qualitative score (sum of 
erythema, thickness, and scaling scores) is multiplied by the degree of involvement for 
each anatomic region and then multiplied by the degree of involvement  for each anatomic 
region and then multiplied by a constant. These values for each anatomic region are 
summed to yield the PASI score. See details in Appendix C . 
 Body Surface Area (BSA)  
BSA is a measurement of involved skin. The overal l BSA affected by psoriasis is 
estimated based on the palm area of the subject’s hand, which equates to approximately 
1% of total body surface area.  
 Scalp Physician Global Assessment (ScPGA)  
The ScPGA is the Investigator’s assessment of severity of psorias is of the scalp, if 
present at baseline. When making the assessment of overall severity, the Investigator 
should factor in areas that have already been cleared (ie, have scores of 0 and not just 
evaluate remaining lesions for severity, ie, the severity of each sign is averaged across all 
areas of involvement, including cleared lesions. See details in Appendix D .

Protocol CC -10004 -PPSO -003  Amgen Inc.  
Confidential and Proprietary  44 CC-10004 -PPSO -003 Amendment 5 Final: 17 Dec  2021  Modified Static Physician Global Assessment of Genitalia (sPGA -G) 
The sPGA -G is the Investigator’s assessment of seve rity of psoriasis of the genitals, if 
present at baseline. See details in Appendix E . 
6.5. Safety Assessments  
6.5.1.  Adverse Events  
Safety assessments will be performed as outlined in the Table of Events, Section  5. 
Details of AE reporting can be found in Section  10.  All AEs will be monitored and recorded 
from the time the subject signs the ICF until 98 days (14 weeks) after the last dose of 
investigational product for subjects that discontinue the study early or opt not to continue into the 
long-term study.   Any Serious adverse events (SAEs) made known to the Investigator at any time 
will be monitored, recorded and reported following the protocol -required re porting period or 
after the end of study.  
6.5.2.  Contraception Education  
There are no adequate and well controlled studies of apremilast in pregnant women.  
All females of childbearing potential (FCBP) must practice abstinence or use one of the 
approved contracept ive options as described in Section  4.2 while on investigational product and 
for at least  28 days after administration of the last dose of the investigational product. If a female 
subject is considered a FCBP when entering the study, the chosen form of contraception must be 
effective by the time the female subject is randomized in to the study  (for example, hormonal 
contraception should be initiated at least 28 days before randomization).  
When a female subject of childbearing potential’s contraceptive measures or ability to become 
pregnant changes at the time of study entry or at any time durin g the study, the Investigator will 
educate the subject regarding options, including abstinence, and the correct and consistent use of 
effective contraceptive methods in order to successfully prevent pregnancy.  
More information regarding the effects of apre milast on reproduction in animal and in vitro 
studies can be found in the Investigator’s Brochure.  
6.5.3.  Serum and Urine Pregnancy Tests for Females of Childbearing Potential  
A serum pregnancy test with a sensitivity of ≤ 25 mI U/mL will be required for all FCBP  at 
Screening and as confirmation of any positive urine test.  Urine pregnancy testing will be 
performed on all FCBP at Screening, Baseline, and at each visit, except Visit 3, during the 
Placebo -controlled and Apremilast Extension Phases as well as at the 4, 8 and 14 week post -last-
dose follow -up visits (Early Termination Visit as well if applicable). A urine pregnancy test kit 
will be provided by the central laboratory. Pregnancy testing should be performed if the FCBP 
has missed a menstrual period or the contraception method has changed.  
For the purposes of this study, a female subject is considered of childbearing potential if she is 
≥ 12 years old or has reached menarche, whichever occurred first.

A complete physical examination i ncludes evaluations of general appearance, skin, nasal 
cavities, eyes, ears, lymph nodes, and respiratory, cardiovascular, GI, neurological, and 
musculoskeletal systems will be performed at Screening and the Week 52 visit or any early 
termination visit.  
6.5.5.  Abbreviated Physical Exam  
An abbreviated physical examination includes evaluation of the general appearance, respiratory, 
cardiovascular and GI systems may be performed at any visit after Screening at the discretion of 
the investigator, if clinically neede d. 
6.5.6.  Hepatitis B and C Testing  
Hepatitis testing will be performed at Screening and will include hepatitis B surface antigen and 
hepatitis C antibody.  
6.5.7.  Vital Signs, Height, Weight and Body Mass Index  
Vital signs, including temperature, respiratory rate, pulse , and blood pressure, will be taken 
during the visits indicated in the Table of Events ( Section  5).  Vital signs will be obtained after 
the subject has been in the supine position for at least 5 minutes. Height (using stadiometer) and 
weight and body mass index will be measured and recorded at Screening and then as indicated in 
the Table of Ev ents (Section  5). 
Blood pressure will be obtained after the subject has been in the supin e position for at least 
5 minutes. Since drinking hot or cold beverages (including water) has a significant impact on 
recorded oral body temperature, no beverages should be ingested within 15 minutes when using 
an oral thermometer.  
Investigators are to rep ort any clinically significant abnormal findings as AEs.  
6.5.8.  Clinical Laboratory Evaluations  
A central laboratory will be used for this study.  Clinical laboratory evaluations will be 
performed as indicated in the Table of Events ( Section  5). The Principal Investigator (PI) or 
medically -qualified designee will review and asses s all clinical laboratory data. The laboratory 
reports should be initialed and dated by the PI or medically -qualified designee, and the clinical or 
nonclinical significance of any abnormal laboratory results should be indicated. Abnormal 
laboratory results  may be repeated to rule out laboratory errors. Any clinically significant 
abnormal laboratory result should be reported as an AE and should be followed to resolution 
(ie, stabilizes, returns to baseline or becomes clinically insignificant).  
Additional cli nical safety laboratory evaluations should be performed if judged clinically 
appropriate by the Investigator or by a medically qualified designee, or if the ongoing review of 
the data suggests a more detailed assessment of clinical laboratory safety evalua tions is 
warranted.  
The amount of blood taken from subjects at each visit and cumulatively over the course of the 
entire study is within the safety limits as described in a bulletin published by the World Health

Confidential and Proprietary  46 CC-10004 -PPSO -003 Amendment 5 Final: 17 Dec  2021 Organization (WHO). ( Howie, 2011 ). The volume of blood drawn will not exceed 11 mL at any 
visit.  
6.5.9.  Hematology  
Hematology laboratory evaluations will include red blood cells (RBCs), hemoglobin, hematocrit, 
white blood cells (WBCs), absolute and differential and platelet co unt. Approximately 2 mL of 
blood will be taken to complete hematology evaluations at each visit as designated in Table  3. 
An additional 5 mL of blood will be collected at the Screening visit to screen for hepatitis.  
6.5.10.  Serum Chemistry  
Serum chemistry laboratory evaluations will include sodium, potassium, chloride, carbon 
dioxide, calcium, blood ure a nitrogen, creatinine, glucose, albumin, total protein, alkaline 
phosphatase, bilirubin (total and direct), aspartate aminotransferase/serum glutamic oxaloacetic 
transaminase (AST/SGOT), alanine aminotransferase/serum glutamate pyruvic transaminase 
(ALT/S GPT), gamma -glutamyl transpeptidase, lactate dehydrogenase, phosphate, and 
magnesium. Approximately 3.5 mL of blood will be taken to complete serum chemistry 
evaluations at each visit as designated in Table  3. 
6.5.11.  Urinalysis  
Urinalysis will include specific gravity, pH, glucose, protein, ketones, and hemoglobin/blood. A 
microscopic examination (eg, c asts, RBCs, and WBCs) will be performed in the event of a 
positive result.  
6.5.12.  Psychiatric Evaluation  
Psoriasis has been associated with an increased risk of developing psychiatric disorders, 
including depression and anxiety in pediatric patients ( Kimball, 2012 ). Apremilast prescriber 
information (eg, Summary of Product Characteristics, Package Insert) includes a warning 
regarding depression and suicidal thoughts. The investigators should advise subjects, their 
caregivers, and fami lies of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of depression or 
other mood changes, and if such changes occur, to contact the investigator.  
All subjects will complete the Columbia -Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS) ( Appendix F ) 
assessment. This questionnaire is suitable for assessment of suicidal ideation and behavior in 
clinical and research settings ( Posner, 2011 ). Any subject, during Screening or at Baseline, that 
answers ‘Yes’ to any question on the C -SSRS, will be ineligible for study participation and 
should be referred immediately for a psychiatric evaluation.  
During the study (post Baseline), each subject will complete an additional C -SSRS questionnaire 
at each study visit u p to Week 16 and then approximately every other visit thereafter. Any 
subject that answers ‘Yes’ to any question on the C -SSRS at any time during the study will be 
immediately withdrawn from study treatment and must be referred immediately for a psychiatri c 
evaluation. The subject should return for the Observational Follow -up Visits at four, eight and 
fourteen weeks after Early Termination.  
A copy of the psychiatric evaluation report, if available, should be in the subject’s source 
document.

Diarrhea is the passage of three or more watery/liquid stools per day ( WHO, 2017 ).  
Subjects and their parent/guardian will be supplied with diaries (either paper or electronic) that 
will be filled out daily to record and describ e any diarrhea, including duration, frequency, and 
associated symptoms ( Appendix G ). Subjects and their parent/guardian will complete the Stool 
Diary every day beginning after the first dose of apremilast, up to the 4 -week post  last dose 
Observational Follow -up visit (Visit 17). The investigator will review diary entries with the 
subject and his/her caregiver at each study visit.  
6.5.14.  Tanner Staging  
Assessments of sexual maturity (Tanner Staging) will be performed at Baseline and Wee k 52 
(Visit 16) or the Early Termination visit for subjects that do not complete the study. A 
description of each Tanner stage is provided in Appendix H  (WHO, 2010 ). 
6.5.15.   Worsening of Psoriasis and Rebound Assessments  
Psoriasis flare is an AE (and will be recorded as an AE) and represents an atypical or unusual 
worsening of disease during treatment ( Carey, 2006 ). It is defined as a sudden intensification of 
psoriasis req uiring medical intervention or a diagnosis of new generalized erythrodermic, 
inflammatory, or pustular psoriasis. A more typical, gradual worsening of plaque psoriasis will 
not to be recorded as an AE.  
Rebound is an AE and is defined as a severe and sudden  worsening of disease that occurs after 
treatment had been discontinued. This exacerbation is characterized by a PASI ≥ 125% of 
baseline or a new generalized pustular, erythrodermic, or more inflammatory psoriasis after 
stopping therapy ( Gordon, 2005 ). 
6.5.16.  Unscheduled Visits  
Unscheduled visits may be necessary during the course of the study to capture a subject’s status 
between regularly scheduled visits. Examples include, but are not limited to, a worsening of 
psoriasis symptoms, occurrence of an AE, or follow -up to a previously reported AE.  
The following assessments will be performed at these visits:  
 Assess vital signs (temperature, respiratory rate, pulse, and blood pressure) and weight  
 Record concomitant medications/procedures a nd AEs  
 Drug accountability and dispensation if needed  
 sPGA and PASI  
 Psoriasis flare/rebound  
 C-SSRS questionnaire  
The following assessments may also be performed at the discretion of the Investigator, if 
clinically needed:  
 Obtain blood sample and/or urine s ample for any necessary laboratory test indicated in 
the Table of Events ( Table  3)

6.6. Pharmacokinetics  
All enrolled subjects who take at least one dose of apremilast should have one blood specimen 
drawn at four visits (Weeks 4, 8, 16, and 24) for measurement of apremilast in plasma. A small 
amount of blood (approximately 2 mL) will be drawn before the morning apremilast dose at 
Weeks 4, 16, and 24. The Week 8 blood specimen, also approximately 2 mL, will be drawn at 
least 30 minutes aft er the morning apremilast dose. The evaluable PK data from 
CC-10004 -PPSO -003 will be pooled with those from CC -10004 -PPSO -001 and the studies in 
adults with moderate -to-severe plaque -type psoriasis for the population PK analysis.  
The blood samples will be taken through an indwelling venous cannula by direct venipuncture at 
the following nominal times shown in Table  4. Concentrations of apremilast in plasma will be 
measured using a validated liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry assay.

The date and time of the last evening dose (for pre -dose blood draw) on the day prior to the 
clinical visit and the current morning dose (for post -dose blood draw) on the day of visit will be 
recorded in the source documents and eCRF. Actual PK blood sampl e collection date and time 
will also be recorded in the source documents and eCRF. Explanations should be provided in the 
source documents and eCRF for missed or mishandled samples and for samples collected outside 
the acceptable time window as described i n Table  4. Specific details regarding collection, 
handling, processing, storage, and shipme nt of PK samples can be found in Appendix I . 
6.7. Biomarkers, Pharmacodynamics, Pharmacogenomics  
 Pharmacodynamic Peripheral Blood RNA Gene Expression  
PDE4 is highly overexpressed in the peripheral blood of a subset of psoriasis patients ( Schafer, 
2016 ). Furthermore, apremilast has been found to reduce Th17 and Th22 cytokine expression in 
the lesional skin and peripheral blood of psoriasis patients ( Gottlieb, 2013 ; Krueger, 2016 ). By 
optional consent, peripheral blood (approximately 2.5 mL) will be drawn to measure RNA 
expression at baseline and during the treatment period.  
Whole blood will be used for the analysis. The expression of specific RNAs, such as but not 
limited to PDE4A, PDE4B, PDE4C, PDE4D, IL17A, IL17F, IL22, and TNF -α, will be analyzed 
at Baseline (Week 0) and during the Placebo -controlled Treatment Phase at Week 16. These data 
will further define the mechanism of action of apremi last in this patient population, and may 
inform on the subset of patients who are responding well to apremilast treatment.  
 Pharmacogenetic DNA Analysis  
By optional consent, a buccal swab will be collected at Visit 2 (Baseline Visit; day of 
randomization) f or the purposes of analyzing the genetic polymorphisms that are associated with

examined for the presence of polymorphisms in the genes encoding the targets of ap remilast 
(PDE4A, PDE4B, PDE4C, and PDE4D), and in genes associated with psoriasis, including but 
not limited to HLA -Cw6, TNF -α, LCE3B/3C, IL12B, IL23A, IL23R, LCE, TNIP1, IFHIH1, and 
NFKBIA. Subjects at selected sites will have the option to participate in  the Pharmacogenetic 
Analysis sub -study and must sign a separate consent form specific to the Pharmacogenetic 
Analysis sub -study at Visit 1 (Screening Visit). Detailed instructions for sample preparation and 
handling will be contained in the separate labor atory manual prepared for the sites.  
 Skin Microbiome Analysis  
By optional consent, the microbial species (bacterial and fungal) present on the patients’ skin 
will be assessed by swabbing the affected and unaffected skin and subjected the swabbed 
material t o 16S and ITS ribosomal RNA gene amplification and sequencing. Affected and 
unaffected skin will be analyzed at Baseline (Week 0) and during the Placebo -controlled 
Treatment Phase at Week 16.  
6.8. Subject Reported Outcomes or Health Related Quality of Life  
 Children’s Dermatology Life Quality Index (CDLQI)  
The CDLQI is designed to measure the impact of skin disease on children’s quality of 
life. It is a self -explanatory questionnaire that can be handed to the subject to fill out with 
the help of a parent or guard ian, See details in Appendix J . 
 Family Dermatology Life Quality Index (FDLQI)  
This is a self -explanatory questionnaire designed for adults (more than 16 years of age), 
that must be handed to a subject’s caregiver/family member for completion. The FDLQI 
will assess the impact of skin disease experienced by a family member. See details in 
Appendix K . 
 Modified Whole Body Itch Numeric Rating Scale (NRS)  
The pruritus NRS whole body assessment is a tool d esigned to measure the amount of 
whole body itch due to psoriasis in the previous 24 -hour period by circling a number on a 
scale from 0 to 10. See details in Appendix  L.

7.1. Description of Investigational Product  
The chemical name of apremilast (CC -10004) is acetamide, N[2 -[(1S) -1-(3-ethoxy -4-
methoxyphenyl) -2-(methylsulfonyl)ethyl] -2,3-dihydro -1,3-dioxo -1H-isoindol -4-yl].  
Investigational product will be provided in blister cards and bottles , depending on the phase of 
the study. Apremilast will be provided as 10, 20, and 30 mg tablets. Placebo will be provided as 
identically appearing 10, 20, and 30 mg tablets. Investigational product will be taken orally twice 
daily, approximately 12 hours a part, without restriction of food or drink. To reduce potential 
gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, dose titration will be implemented during Week 0 and Week  16 
of this study (see Table  5). 
7.2. Treatment Administration and Schedule  
At Visit 2 (Week 0), subjects who meet entry  criteria will be rand omized using a permuted block 
randomiza tion in parall el 2:1 to receive  either apremilas t or placebo treatment, using a 
centralized IRT. Randomization to apremilast arm or placebo arm will be stratified by baseline 
age group (6 to 11 years or 12 to 17 years). Subjects with baseline weight between 20 kg to 
< 50 kg will receive apremilast 20 mg BID or placebo BID and subjects with baseline weight 
≥ 50 kg will receive apremilast 30 mg BID or placebo BID.   
During Week 0 visit, subjects will be dispensed dose titration blister cards with 10, 20, and 
30 mg apremilast tablets, depending on baseline weight, or identically appearing placebo tablets. 
The blister cards will contain all IP required for 4 weeks of treatment, and the titration supplies 
or matching placebo are in the 1st week (see Table  5 Treatment Schema for Dose Titration at 
Visit 2 [Week 0]). Investigational product will be administered as indicated below:  
 Weeks 0 to 16: Placeb o-controlled  Treatment  Phase:  Apremilast  20 mg BID, 
Apremilast 30 mg BID or placebo BID.  
 Week 0: sub jects will be dose titrated as described in Table  5.  
 Weeks 16 to 52: Apremilast Extension Phase: Apremilast 20 mg BID and apremilast 
30 mg BID.  
 Week 16: subjects will be dose titrated as described in Table  6.

At Week 16, subjects who were originally rand omized to placebo at Week 0 will be switched to receive apremilast treatment, where 
dose levels (either 20 mg BID or 30 mg BID) would have been determined at Week 0 using their baseline weight categories (20 kg to 
< 50 kg, or ≥ 50 kg). Subjects randomized to the apremilast arm at Week 0 will remain on their assigned apremilast dose levels (ei ther 
20 mg BID or 30 mg BID).  
During Weeks 16 to 52, study investigators and study subjects will remain blinded to the initial IP assignments . To maintain the blind, 
all subjects will receive dose titration cards at the Week 16 visit. Although only subjects initially randomized to placebo w ill be dose 
titrated during their first week of the Apremilast Extension Phase, all subjects entering the Apremilast Extension Phase  will receive 
identically -appearing titration/treatment cards. The treatment schema for dose titration at Week 16 is shown in the tables below.

Protocol CC -10004 -PPSO -003  Amgen Inc.  
Confidential and Proprietary  53 CC-10004 -PPSO -003 Amendment 5 Final: 17 Dec  2021 Investigational product will be taken orally twice daily, approximately 12 hours apart, without 
restriction of food or drink. To reduce potential gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, dose titration 
will be implemented in this stu dy (Table  5 and Table  6). Apremilast dose titration will be 
provided in blister cards as 10, 20, and 30 mg tablets or identically appearing placebo tablets. 
Blister card configuration s are pictured in Appendix M . The Apremilast Extension Phase begins 
with a titration period where IP will be supplied in blister cards. After completion of the 
Apremilast Extension Phase titration period, IP will be distributed  in bottles containing 20 or 
30 mg tablets for the remainder of the study.  
7.3. Overdose  
Overdose, as defined for this protocol, applies to protocol -required dosing of the investigational 
products only. Therefore, for a drug to be subject to the overdose defini tion it must be both 
required and an investigational drug. In this study, the only required and investigational drug is 
apremilast and the control arm (ie, placebo), hence overdose definition will apply to only 
apremilast (or matching placebo). Other requi red or optional non -IP intended for prophylaxis of 
certain side effects, etc, are excluded from this definition.  
Overdose for this protocol, on a per dose basis, is defined as ingestion of greater than 100 mg of 
apremilast (or matching placebo) tablets in  any 24 -hour period whether by accident or 
intentionally. On a schedule or frequency basis, an overdose is defined as dosing more than 
4 times during any 24 -hour period.  
7.4. Method of Treatment Assignment  
At Visit 2 (Week 0), subjects who meet entry criteria will be randomized to receive either 
apremilast or placebo (2:1), using a centralized interactive response technology (IRT). 
Designated research personnel at the investigational sites will be assigned password protected, 
coded identification numbers, which  gives them authorization to enter the IRT to randomize 
subjects.  
The system will present a menu of questions by which the research center personnel will identify 
the subject and IRT will assign a randomization identification number.  
Confirmation of the ra ndomization will be sent to the investigational site, Amgen, and/or its 
representative. The confirmation reports should be maintained as source documents.  
During the study visits, the pharmacy or authorized study personnel at the investigational site 
will dispense coded IP kits in accordance with the randomization number assigned by the IRT.  
7.5. Packaging and Labeling  
The label(s) for IP may include, but may not be limited to, Sponsor name, address and telephone 
number, the protocol number, IP name, dosage for m and strength (where applicable), amount of 
IP per container, lot number, expiry date (where applicable), medication identification/kit 
number, dosing instructions, storage conditions, and required caution statements and/or 
regulatory statements as applic able. Additional information may be included on the label as 
applicable per local regulations.

Confidential and Proprietary  54 CC-10004 -PPSO -003 Amendment 5 Final: 17 Dec  2021 7.6. Investigational Product Accountability and Disposal  
The Investigator(s) or a qualified designee(s) is/are responsible for taking an inventory of each 
shipment o f apremilast received, and comparing it with the accompanying apremilast 
accountability form. The Investigator(s) or designee(s), will verify the accuracy of the 
information on the form, sign and date it, retain a copy in the study file, and record the 
information in the IRT.  
At the study site, all apremilast will be stored in a secure, locked area to prevent unauthorized 
access.  Investigational product must be stored as directed on the label(s).  
The Investigator(s) or qualified designee(s) is responsible for the accountability of all apremilast 
issued to the site during the course of the study.  
Amgen (or designee) will review with the Investigator and relevant site personnel the process for 
apremilast return, disposal, and/or destruction including respons ibilities for the site versus 
Amgen (or designee).  
7.7. Investigational Product Compliance  
All doses administered in the clinic will be administered under direct supervision of trained staff. 
The individual(s) responsible for dosing will check the subject’s mou th to ensure that the tablet 
has been swallowed whole (ie, not chewed or crushed).  
The study staff will maintain an ongoing record of the dispensing and administration of 
apremilast for each subject via an accountability record or equivalent document that will be 
verified by Amgen’s study monitor.  
For apremilast dispensed to the subject/guardian for outpatient administration, study personnel 
will review the instructions printed on the package with the study subject and/or legal guardian 
prior to dispensing apremilast in tablet form. Investigational product will be dispensed as noted 
in the Table of Events, Section  5. The subjects will be instructed to return the apremilast blister 
cards and bottles, including any unused medication, to the study site at each visit for tablet 
counts and reconciliation. Subjects will be asked whether they have take n their apremilast as 
instructed at each study visit. Any problems with apremilast compliance will be reviewed with 
the subject. If a subject misses four or more consecutive days of dosing, Amgen should be 
contacted to decide whether dosing should resume o r whether the subject should be terminated 
from the treatment phase of the study.  
Gross compliance problems (eg, missing 4 or more consecutive days of dosing or taking less 
than 75% of the doses between study visits) should be discussed with Amgen. Overall  
compliance with the study treatment regimen is defined as taking between 75% and 120% of the 
expected doses during a subject’s participation while in the treatment phases (Placebo -controlled 
Treatment Phase and Apremilast Extension Phase) of the study.  
Accurate recording of all apremilast administration (including dispensing and dosing) will be 
made in the appropriate section of the subject’s eCRF and source documents.

Over the course of this study, additional medicat ions may be required to manage aspects of the 
disease state of the subjects, including side effects from trial treatments or disease progression.  
For information regarding other drugs that may interact with IP and affect its metabolism, 
pharmacokinetics, or excretion, please see the Investigators Brochure and/or local package insert.  
8.1. Permitted Concomitant Medications and Procedures  
Subjects may take any medication that is not restricted by the protocol, is not expected to 
interfere with the conduct of the study and will not affect study assessments. Chronic medication 
should be dosed on a stable regimen and continued through the 36 -week Apremilast Extension 
Phase.  
All medications (prescription and non -prescription), treatments and therapies taken by the 
subject from Screening throughout the Placebo -controlled Treatment Phase and Apremilast 
Extension Phase and the 4 -, 8-, and 14 -week follow -up periods, including those initiated within 
30 days prior to the start of the study, must be recorded on the subject’s source document and on 
the appropriate page of the eCRF. The name of the medication/treatment, dose, unit, frequency, 
route, indication, the date the medication was started and the date the medication was stopped (if 
not ongoing) must be recorded. The reco rding of any permitted topical medications taken for 
psoriasis should also include the area of the body to which they are applied.  
The following topical therapy will be permitted*:  
 Low-potency or weak corticosteroids (such as hydrocortisone, desonide, alcl ometasone 
dipropionate) will be allowed as background therapy for treatment of the face, axillae, 
and groin in accordance with the manufacturers’ suggested usage during the course of the 
study.  
 An unmedicated skin moisturizer (eg, Eucerin®) will also be pe rmitted for body lesions 
only 
* Subjects should not use these topical treatments within 24 hours of a study visit.  
From Week 8 through Week 16, subjects who meet the criteria for early escape ( PASI increase 
≥ 50% from baseline) will be allowed to commence treatment with moderate -to-high potency 
topical steroid preparations and continue receiving IP.  
At Week 32, subjects who did not achieve a 50% improvement in psoriasis area severity index 
(PASI -50) from baseline, can add topical standard of care therapy an d continue to receive 
apremilast.  
8.2. Prohibited Concomitant Medications and Procedures

9.1. Overview  
This is a Phase 3, multi -center, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled study to assess the 
efficacy and safety of apremilast (CC -10004) in pediatric subjects from 6 through 17 years of 
age with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. Integrated Response Technology (IRT) will be 
utilized to ensure a central randomization based on a parallel permuted block randomization 
scheme . Randomization to the apremilast arm or the placebo arm will be stratified  by age group 
(6 to 11  years or 12 to 17 years), with a minimum of 75 subjects for each age group. Subjects 
randomized to apremilast will receive weight -based apremilast dose which will provide 
comparable exposure to the adult subjects treated with 30 mg B ID. Therefore, the apremilast arm 
will include both 20 mg BID and 30 mg BID for the statistical analysis.   
9.2. Study Population Definitions  
The safety population will consist of all subjects who are randomized and received at least one 
dose of investigational product (IP). Subjects will be included in the treatment group 
corresponding to the IP they actually received.  
The intent -to-treat (ITT) population will consist of all subjects who are randomized regardless of 
whether or not the subject received IP. Subjec ts will be included in the treatment group to which 
they are randomized.  
The per protocol (PP) population will consist of all subjects included in the ITT population who 
receive at least one dose of IP, have both baseline and at least one post -treatment sP GA 
assessment, and have no important protocol deviations which may affect efficacy assessments in 
the Placebo -controlled Treatment Phase.  
9.3. Sample Size and Power Considerations  
At least 230 pediatric subjects (ages from 6 through 17 years) will be randomized  to receive 
either apremilast or placebo (2:1) at Week 0. The sample size estimation is based on the results 
of the adult Phase 3 and 3b studies with apremilast (CC -10004 -PSOR -008, 
CC-10004 -PSOR -009 and CC -10004 -PSOR -010) which demonstrated positive treatm ent effects 
between apremilast and placebo in the proportion of subjects achieving sPGA response and 
PASI -75 response at Week 16.  
With a total of 230 patients and a randomization ratio of 2:1, the study will have 90% power to 
detect a 15% difference (20% versus 5%) between apremilast arm and placebo arm for the 
proportion of subjects achieving sPGA response at Week 16, based on a Chi -square test at a 
two-sided significance level of 0.05. The study will also have more than 95 % power to detect a 
20% differen ce (30% versus 10%) between apremilast and placebo for the proportion of subjects 
achieving PASI -75 response at Week 16.  
9.4. Background and Demographic Characteristics  
Subject’s age, height (as measured with stadiometer), weight, and baseline characteristics w ill be 
summarized using descriptive statistics, while sex, race and other categorical variables will be 
provided using frequency tabulations. Medical history data will be summarized using frequency

Statistical comparisons will be made between apremilast arm and placebo arm. All statistical 
tests will be at the two -sided 0.05 significance level  and the corr esponding p -values will be 
reported. Data summaries will be provided for the two randomized treatment arms (apremilast 
and placebo).  
9.6.1.1.  Primary Efficacy Endpoint  
The primary endpoint is the proportions of subjects achieving sPGA response at Week 16 
(defined a s sPGA score of clear (0) or almost clear (1) with at least a 2 -point reduction from 
baseline at Week 16). The estimand of primary interest is defined in terms of the following four 
attributes : 
A. The population is defined through appropriate inclusion/exc lusion criteria to reflect the 
targeted patient population for approval (eg, ITT Population);  
B. The variable is the proportion of subjects who achieve sPGA response at Week 16. 
Subjects who terminate early due to lack of efficacy or add moderate -to-high p otency topical 
steroid preparations (early escape) or other protocol prohibited medications prior to Week 16 
will be assigned as non -responders.  
C. Potential intercurrent  events are captured through the variable definition (B).  
D. The summary measure is t he difference in response proportions.  
Missing values at Week 16 for this estimand will be imputed using the multiple imputation (MI) 
method (SAS Institute Inc, 2011 ) based on similar subjects who remained in the study as the 
primary method . With this missing data handling approach, the estimand answers a clinically 
relevant question that compares the number of subjects who achieve the defined response criteria 
at Week 16 in the ITT population.  
The primary endpoint will be ana lyzed  using the CMH (Cochran –Mantel –Haenszel) test 
adjusting for the stratification factor at randomization. The two -sided p -values from the CMH 
test, the adjusted treatment difference in proportion using the weighted average of the treatment 
differences a cross the strata with the CMH weights, along with the associated two -sided 95%  CIs 
using a normal approximation to the weighted average will be provided.

Protocol CC -10004 -PPSO -003  Amgen Inc.  
Confidential and Proprietary  59 CC-10004 -PPSO -003 Amendment 5 Final: 17 Dec  2021 Sensitivity analysis will be conducted to account for missing data using the  last observation 
carried forward (LOCF) method, the non -responder imputation (NRI) method and the tipping 
point analyses. A sensitivity analysis using the PP population will also be performed.  
For the multiple imputation method, t he SAS procedure MI will be used to impute missing  sPGA 
scores at the scheduled analysis visits in the Placebo -controlled Treatment Phase (Weeks 0 to 16) 
to create M=25 complete data sets. The sPGA assessment data will not be included in multiple 
imputation steps from s ubjects who terminate early due to l ack of efficacy or add moderate -to-
high potency topical steroid preparations (early escape) or other protocol prohibited medications 
prior to Week 16. The missing data patterns will be checked at the scheduled analysis visits, ie, 
Baseline (Week 0), and We eks 2, 4, 8, 12 and 16. If there are non -monotone missing patterns, 
two separate imputation procedures will be used to complete the imputation process.  
In the first step, the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method will be used with a single 
chain to imput e missing scores by treatment and stratification factor to create M=25 imputed data 
sets with monotone missing patterns.  In case there are convergence issues, a simple model will 
be used to impute the missing scores by treatment, with further simplificati on by dropping both 
treatment and stratification factor in imputation model if necessary. The seed will be set to 
17813721. The imputed scores will be rounded to the nearest integer. The minimum and the 
maximum values for imputation will be 0 and 4, which correspond to the lowest and the highest 
sPGA scores.  
In the second step, the predictive mean matching method will be used to impute the remaining 
missing scores for the 25 data sets with monotone missing patterns. The imputation procedure 
will use monoto ne statement to create one complete data set for each of the monotone data set 
from the first step, and the variables will include treatment arm, stratification factor, and sPGA 
scores at scheduled analysis visits from Baseline to Week 16. The seed will be  set to 55218163.  
After the completion of imputation, sPGA response at Week 16 will be derived based on both 
observed and imputed scores. Data from subjects who terminate early due to lack of efficacy or 
add moderate -to-high potency topical steroid prepar ations (early escape) or other protocol 
prohibited medications prior to Week 16 as non -responders will be added to the 25 imputed data 
sets. The same CMH method will be used to analyze the 25 complete data sets and the SAS 
procedure MIANALYZE will be used to combine the results for the statistical inferences. This 
study is a multicenter study and planned to have more than 100 study sites to enroll at least  
230 subjects. A single site may not have a sufficient number of subjects to allow a meaningful 
within -site analysis; therefore, study sites will be pooled for the analysis. The primary endpoint 
will be further analyzed adjusting for the stratification factor and the pooled site and examining 
whether the treatment differences are consistent with those from the primary analysis. In 
addition, the consistency of the treatment effect across individual study sites (or pooled sites) 
will also be assessed by performing a subgroup -type analysis with individual study sites (or 
pooled sites) treated as subgroups. List ings of response rates will be provided by individual study 
site and by pooled site. The treatment difference for each of the individual study sites (or pooled 
sites) will be reviewed to evaluate the effect among the individual study sites (or pooled sites ). 
9.6.1.2.  Major Secondary Efficacy Endpoint  
The major secondary efficacy endpoint is the proportions of subjects who achieving PASI -75 
response at Week 16 (defined as at least a 75% reduction in total PASI score from baseline at 
Apremilast  
Protocol CC -10004 -PPSO -003  Amgen Inc.  
Confidential and Proprietary  60 CC-10004 -PPSO -003 Amendment 5 Final: 17 Dec  2021 Week 16 ), which will be analyzed using the same approaches as the primary endpoint.  The 
estimand of primary interest is defined in terms of the following four attributes:  
A. The population is defined through appropriate inclusion/exclusion criteria to reflect the 
targeted patient populatio n for approval (eg, ITT Population);  
B. The variable is the proportion of subjects who achieving PASI -75 response at Week 16. 
Subjects who terminate early due to lack of efficacy or add moderate -to-high potency topical 
steroid preparations (early escape) o r other protocol prohibited medications prior to Week  16 
will be assigned as non -responders.  
C. Potential intercurrent events are captured through the variable definition (B).  
D. The summary measure is the difference in response proportions.  
Missing valu es at Week 16 will be imputed using the multiple imputation (MI) method (SAS 
Institute Inc, 2011 ) based on similar subjects who remained in the study . With this missing data 
handling approach, the estimand answers a clinically  relevant question that compares the number 
of subjects who achieve the defined response criteria at Week 16 in the ITT population  
The primary analysis for this estimand will use CMH (Cochran –Mantel –Haenszel) test adjusting 
for the stratification factor at  randomization. The two -sided p -values from the CMH test, the 
adjusted treatment difference in proportion using the weighted average of the treatment 
differences across the strata with the CMH weights, along with the associated two -sided 95%  CIs 
using a no rmal approximation to the weighted average will be provided.  
Sensitivity analysis will be conducted to account for missing data using the  last observation 
carried forward (LOCF) method, the NRI method, and tipping point analyses. A sensitivity 
analysis using the PP population will also be performed.  
For using the multiple imputation method, t he SAS procedure MI will be used to impute missi ng 
total PASI scores at the scheduled analysis visits in the Placebo -controlled Treatment Phase 
(Weeks 0 -16) to create M=25 complete data sets. The PASI assessment data will not be included 
in multiple imputation steps from s ubjects who terminate early due  to lack of efficacy or who 
added moderate -to-high potency topical steroid preparations (early escape) or other protocol 
prohibited medications prior to Week 16. The missing data patterns will be checked at the 
scheduled analysis visits, ie, Baseline (Week  0), and Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12 and 16. If there are 
non-monotone missing patterns, two separate imputation procedures will be used to complete the 
imputation process.  
In the first step, the MCMC method will be used to impute missing scores by treatment and 
stratification factor to create M=25 imputed data sets with monotone missing patterns. In case 
there are convergence issues, a simple model will be used to impute the missing scores by 
treatment, with further simplification by dropping both treatment and str atification factor in 
imputation model if necessary. The minimum and the maximum values for imputation will be 0 
and 72, which correspond to the lowest and the highest total PASI scores. The seed will be set to 
17813721 and a single chain will be used to p roduce imputations. The imputed scores will be 
rounded to numbers with one digit.  
In the second step, the predictive mean matching method will be used to impute the remaining 
missing scores for the 25 data sets with monotone missing patterns. The imputati on procedure 
will use monotone statement to create one complete data set for each of the monotone data set

PASI scores at scheduled analysis visits from bas eline to Week 16. The seed will be set to 
55218163.  
After the completion of imputation, PASI -75 response at Week 16 will be derived based on both 
observed and imputed scores. Data from s ubjects who early terminate early due to lack of 
efficacy or add mode rate-to-high potency topical steroid preparations (early escape) or other 
protocol prohibited medications prior to Week 16 as non -responders will be added to the 25 
imputed data sets. The same CMH method will be used to analyze the 25 complete data sets an d 
the SAS procedure MIANALYZE will be used to combine the results for the statistical 
inferences.  
The major secondary endpoint will also be further analyzed adjusting for the stratification factor 
and the pooled site and examining whether the treatment dif ferences are consistent with those 
from the primary analysis. In addition, the consistency of the treatment effect across individual 
study sites (or pooled sites) will also be assessed by performing a subgroup -type analysis with 
individual study sites (or pooled sites) treated as subgroups. Listings of response rates will be 
provided by individual study site and by pooled site. The treatment difference for each of the 
individual study sites (or pooled sites) will be reviewed to evaluate the effect among the  
individual study sites (or pooled sites).  
9.6.1.3.  Other Secondary Efficacy Endpoints  
The other secondary efficacy endpoints will be analyzed similarly as the primary and the 
secondary endpoints. The main analysis will be based on the ITT population  with missing v alues 
imputed using multiple imputation methods. The 2 -sided p -values and 2 -sided 95% CIs will be 
reported for treatment difference between apremilast and placebo arms.   
The binary endpoint (PASI -50, CDLQI [0/1] response) will be analyzed similarly as the primary 
endpoint. The treatment difference between apremilast arm and placebo arm will be compared 
using CMH (Cochran –Mantel –Haenszel) test adjusting for the stratification factor at 
randomization. The 2 -sided p -values from the CMH test, the adjusted treat ment difference in 
proportion using the weighted average of the treatment differences across the strata with the 
CMH weights, along with the associated 2 -sided 95% CIs using a normal approximation to the 
weighted average will be provided.  Subjects who term inate early due to lack of efficacy or add 
moderate -to-high potency topical steroid preparations (early escape) or other protocol prohibited 
medications prior to Week 16 will be considered non -responders. Missing values will be imputed 
using the similar MI  method as the primary and major secondary endpoints, with sensitivity 
analysis  using the LOCF method and NRI method.  
The continuous endpoint (ie, PASI percent change, BSA percent change, and CDLQI change 
from baseline at Week 16) will be analyzed based on  the ITT population using the analysis of 
covariance (ANCOVA) model. The ANCOVA model will use the change from baseline as the 
dependent variable and will include treatment group and stratification factor as independent 
variables and the baseline value as a covariate variable. Within -group least -squares (LS) mean 
changes from baseline at Week 16, the associated standard errors (SEs) and 2 -sided 95% CIs, 
treatment differences in LS mean changes from baseline, and the associated 2 -sided 95% CIs and 
p-values, will be derived from the ANCOVA model. Missing values at Week 16 will be imputed 
using the MI method, with sensitivity analysis using the LOCF method. The primary analysis

after adding those medications will be removed before using MI method for subjects who add 
moderate -to-high potency topical steroid preparations (early escape) or other protocol prohibited 
medications prior to Week 16. A sensitivity analysis  will be performed with all available data 
using MI method regardless whether subjects add moderate -to-high potency topical steroid 
preparations (early escape) or any protocol prohibited medications prior to Week 16.  
9.6.1.4.  Multiplicity Adjustment  
The primary and the major secondary efficacy endpoints will be hierarchically ranked for testing 
in order to control the overall type I error rate in claiming statistical significance at the 2 -sided 
0.05 significance level . Specifically, for the primary ef ficacy endpoint (sPGA response at 
Week  16), if the 2 -sided p -value from the comparison between apremilast arm and placebo arm 
is below 0.05, the outcome will be considered statistically significant and apremilast will be 
declared effective. For the major s econdary endpoint, statistical significance will be claimed only 
if its 2 -sided p -value is below 0.05 and tests for the primary endpoint is significant at the 2 -sided 
0.05 level. The proposed test sequence for the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints i s listed 
as the following:  
 Proportions of subjects who achieve sPGA response at Week 16 (defined as sPGA 
score of clear (0) or almost clear (1) with at least a 2 -point reduction from baseline at 
Week 16 ) 
 Proportion of subjects who achieve PASI -75 response at Week 16 (defined as at least 
a 75% reduction in total PASI score from baseline at Week 16 ) 
For the other secondary efficacy endpoints, multiplicity adjustment will not be applied and 
statistical significance will not be claimed.  
9.6.1.5.  Exploratory Endpoints  
Descriptive summary statistics or proportion of subjects achieving specified criteria will be 
summarized by treatment group.  When appropriate, exploratory endpoints at Week 16 will also 
be analyzed using CMH or ANCOVA methods similar to the primary and secon dary endpoints.  
9.6.1.6.  Subgroup Analysis  
Subgroup analyses for sPGA and PASI -75 responses at Week 16 based upon baseline 
demographic (age, gender, race, etc.) or baseline  disease characteristics will be provided to 
determine the robustness of the treatment effect . These two endpoints will also be evaluated in 
patients using or not using low potency topical corticosteroids in the phase as two subgroups.  
9.6.2.  Efficacy Evaluation – Apremilast Extension Phase (Weeks 16 to 52)  
Efficacy endpoints for time points in the Aprem ilast Extension Phase  (Weeks 16 to 52) will be 
summarized for subjects who continue apremilast treatment or who switch to apremilast from 
placebo according to the treatment arms assigned at randomization. For all subjects, changes in 
measurements will be c alculated relative to measurements obtained at Baseline (Week 0). 
Descriptive summary statistics or proportion of subjects achieving specified criteria will be 
summarized by treatment group.  For continuous variables, descriptive statistics for baseline and

summarized with frequency tabulations. Two -sided 95% CIs will be provided for changes or 
percent changes and response rates.  
9.7. Safety Analysis  
The safety analyses will be performed using the safety population as defined in Section  9.2. 
Safety will be assessed by clinical review of all relevant parameters, including treatment -
emergent adverse events (TEAEs), laboratory tests, and vital signs; no inferential testing for 
statistical significance will be performed. Data from safety assessm ents will be summarized 
descriptively for the Placebo -controlled Treatment Phase (Weeks 0 to 16) and the Apremilast 
Exposure Period when subjects receive apremilast treatment. For safety analyses in the 
Placebo -controlled Treatment Phase, baseline will be relative to the first dose date following 
randomization at Week 0. For safety analyses in Apremilast Exposure Period, baseline will be 
relative to the first apremilast dose date at Week 0 for subjects initially randomized to apremilast 
or Week 16 for subje cts initially randomized to placebo and switched to apremilast in the 
Apremilast Extension Phase . 
Adverse events will be classified using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
(MedDRA) classification system. Adverse events will be tabulated for the Placebo -controlled 
Treatment Phase (Weeks 0 to 16) and the Apremilast Exposure Phase in the study. All TEAEs 
will be summarized by system organ class, preferred term, severity, and relationship to IP. 
Adverse events leading to death or to IP withdrawal  and serious AEs will also be summarized 
and listed separately.  
Data from other safety assessments will be summarized descriptively. Shift tables for laboratory 
parameters showing the number of subjects with values low, normal, and high compared with the 
normal reference ranges pre -treatment versus post -treatment will be provided.  
To account for the different exposure to the investigational product, adverse events or marked 
laboratory abnormalities will also be summarized using the exposure adjusted incid ent rate, in 
addition to the simple incidence rates.  
By-subject listings will be provided for all relevant safety data.  
9.8. Interim Analysis  
No interim analysis will be conducted.  
After all subjects have completed Week 16 (Visit 7), or discontinued from the study, a Week  16 
database lock will be performed; the primary data analysis will be conducted and a Week  16 
Clinical Study Report will be generated. Study investigators and subje cts will remain blinded to 
treatment assignments until the final database lock at the conclusion of the study. At the end of 
the study, after all subjects have either completed the Observational Follow -up Phase or have 
been discontinued from the Apremilast  Extension Phase  (Weeks 16 to 52) or the Observational 
Follow -up Phase, the final analysis will be performed and a final Clinical Study Report will be 
generated .

9.9.1.  Data Monitoring Committee  
Monitoring will also be performed by an independent, external Data Monitoring Committee 
(DMC) that will assess safety as outlined in the DMC charter (available upon request).  The DMC 
is comprised of three independent external clinical trialists and one independent external 
biostatistician for whom there is n o identified conflict of interest.  The DMC will meet as outlined 
in the DMC charter. The DMC scope, conduct, processes, and accountabilities are prespecified 
in its charter.  Recommendations of the DMC based on the overall benefit/risk evaluation may 
includ e proceeding with the study per protocol, proceeding with the study with modification, or 
study suspension.  
9.9.2.  Scientific Steering Committee  
Guidance in protocol development and interpretation of data analysis will be provided by a 
Scientific Steering Committ ee (SSC).  The SSC will serve in an advisory capacity to the 
Sponsor.  Details for the SSC are pre -specified in a SSC charter.

10.1. Monitoring, Recordin g and Reporting of Adverse Events  
An AE is any noxious, unintended, or untoward medical occurrence that may appear or worsen 
in a subject during the course of a study. It may be a new intercurrent illness, a worsening 
concomitant illness, an injury, or any  concomitant impairment of the subject’s health, including 
laboratory test values (as specified by the criteria in Section 10.3), regardless of etiology. Any 
worsening (ie, any clinically significant adverse change in the frequency or intensity of a 
pre-existing condition) should be considered an AE. A diagnosis or syndrome should be recorded 
on the AE/SAE page of the case report form (CRF) rather than the individual signs or symptoms 
of the diagnosis or syndrome.  
Abuse, withdrawal, sensitivity or toxici ty to an investigational product should be reported as an 
AE.  Overdose, accidental or intentional, whether or not it is associated with an AE should be 
reported on the overdose CRF. (See Section  7.2 for the definition of overdose.) Any sequela of 
an accidental or intentional overdose of an investigational product should be reported as an AE 
on the AE/SAE CRF. If the sequela of an overdose is an SAE, then the sequela must be reported 
on the AE/SAE CRF and the paper SAE report form. The overdose resulting in the SAE should 
not be reported as an SAE itself.   
In the event of overdose, the subject should be monitored as appropriate and should receive 
supportive measures as necessary. There is no known specific antidote for apremilast overdose. 
Actual treatment should depend on the severity of the clinical situation and the judgment and 
experience of  the treating physician.  
All subjects will be monitored for AEs during the study. Assessments may include monitoring of 
any or all of the following parameters:  the subject’s clinical symptoms, laboratory, pathological, 
radiological or surgical findings, p hysical examination findings, or findings from other tests 
and/or procedures.  
All AEs will be recorded by the Investigator from the time the subject’s legal guardian signs 
informed consent until 98 days (14 weeks) after the last dose of IP for those subjec ts that early 
terminate or choose not to enroll in the Long -term Study. All SAEs made known to the 
Investigator at any time following the protocol -required reporting period or after end of study 
will also be reported for these subjects. Subjects entering t he Long -term Study will not complete 
the 14 -week follow up period and therefore will report any AE or SAE occurring after Visit 16 in 
the Long -term Study CRF.  AEs and SAEs for either study will be recorded on the AE/SAE page 
of the CRF, the paper SAE repor t form and in the subject ’s source documents associated with 
that particular study.   
All SAEs must be reported to Amgen Global Patient Safety within 24 hours of the Investigator’s 
knowledge of the event using the paper Serious Adverse Event Report Form by  facsimile/email 
of the paper SAER Form directly to Amgen Global Patient Safety.    
10.2. Evaluation of Adverse Events  
A qualified Investigator will evaluate all adverse events as to:  

Apremilast  
Protocol CC -10004 -PPSO -003  Amgen Inc.  
Confidential and Proprietary  66 CC-10004 -PPSO -003 Amendment 5 Final: 17 Dec  2021 10.2.1.  Seriousness  
An SAE is any AE occurring at any dose that:  
 Results in death;  
 Is life -threatening (ie, in the opinion of the Investigator, the subject is at immediate 
risk of death from the AE);  
 Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization 
(hospitalization is defined as an inpatient admission, regar dless of length of stay);  
 Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (a substantial disruption of the 
subject’s ability to conduct normal life functions);  
 Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect;  
 Constitutes an important medical event.  
Importa nt medical events are defined as those occurrences that may not be immediately 
life-threatening or result in death, hospitalization, or disability, but may jeopardize the subject or 
require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outco mes listed above. 
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether such an AE should be 
considered  serious.  
Events not considered  to be SAEs are hospitalizations for:  
 a standard procedure for protocol therapy administration. However, hospitalization or 
prolonged hospitalization for a complication of therapy administration will be 
reported as an SAE.  
 routine treatment or monitoring of the studied indication not associat ed with any 
deterioration in condition.  
 the administration of blood or platelet transfusion as routine treatment of studied 
indication.  However, hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization for a complication 
of such transfusion remains a reportable SAE.  
 a procedure for protocol/disease -related investigations (eg, surgery, scans, endoscopy, 
sampling for laboratory tests, bone marrow sampling). However, hospitalization or 
prolonged hospitalization for a complication of such procedures remains a reportable 
SAE. 
 hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization for technical, practical, or social 
reasons, in absence of an AE.  
 a procedure that is planned (ie, planned prior to start of treatment on study); must be 
documented in the source document and the CRF. Hospitalization or prolonged 
hospitalization for a complication remains a reportable SAE.  
 an elective treatment of or an elective procedure for a pre -existing condition, 
unrelated to the studied indication, that has not worsened from baseline.  
 emergency o utpatient treatment or observation that does not result in admission, 
unless fulfilling other seriousness criteria above.

Protocol CC -10004 -PPSO -003  Amgen Inc.  
Confidential and Proprietary  67 CC-10004 -PPSO -003 Amendment 5 Final: 17 Dec  2021 If an AE is considered serious, the AE/SAE page/screen of the eCRF must be completed in EDC 
and the paper SAE report form.  
For each SA E, the Investigator will provide information on severity, start and stop dates, 
relationship to the IP, action taken regarding the IP, and outcome.  
10.2.2.  Severity/Intensity  
For both AEs and SAEs, the Investigator must assess the severity/ intensity of the event based on 
the descriptions listed below.  
Mild  
 Asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only  
 Intervention not indicated  
 Activities of daily life (ADLs) minimally or not affected  
 No or minimal intervention/therapy may be required  
Moderate  
 Symptom(s) cause moderate discomfort  
 Local or noninvasive intervention indicated  
 More than minimal interference with ADLs but able to carry out daily social and 
functional activities.  
 Drug therapy may be required  
Severe (could be non -serious or s erious)  
 Symptoms causing severe discomfort/pain  
 Symptoms requiring medical/surgical attention/intervention  
 Interference with ADLs including inability to perform daily social and functional 
activities (eg, absenteeism and/or bed rest)  
 Drug therapy is requi red 
The term “severe” is often used to describe the intensity of a specific event (as in mild, moderate 
or severe myocardial infarction); the event itself, however, may be of relatively minor medical 
significance (such as severe headache). This criterion i s not the same as “serious” which is based 
on subject/event outcome or action criteria associated with events that pose a threat to a subject’s 
life or functioning.   
Seriousness, not severity, serves as a guide for defining regulatory obligations.

Confidential and Proprietary  68 CC-10004 -PPSO -003 Amendment 5 Final: 17 Dec  2021 10.2.3.  Causali ty 
The Investigator must determine the relationship between the administration of the IP and the 
occurrence of an AE/SAE as Not Suspected or Suspected as defined below:  
Not suspected:  a causal relationship of the adverse event to IP administration is 
unlik ely or remote , or other medications, therapeutic 
interventions, or underlying conditions provide a sufficient 
explanation for the observed event.  
Suspected:  there is a reasonable possibility that the administration of IP 
caused the adverse event.  ‘Reason able possibility’ means there 
is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the IP and 
the adverse event.  
Causality should be assessed and provided for every AE/SAE based on currently available 
information. Causality is to be reassessed and provided as additional information becomes 
available.  
If an event is assessed as suspected of being related to a comparator, ancillary or additional 
non-IP that has not been manufactured or provided by Amgen, please provide the name of the 
manufacturer whe n reporting the event.  
10.2.4.  Duration  
For both AEs and SAEs, the Investigator will provide a record of the start and stop dates of the 
event.  
10.2.5.  Action Taken  
The Investigator will report the action taken with IP as a result of an AE or SAE, as applicable 
(eg, discontinuation or interruption of IP, as appropriate) and report if concomitant and/or 
additional treatments were given for the event.  
10.2.6.  Outcome  
The Inves tigator will report the outcome of the event for both AEs and SAEs.  
All SAEs that have not resolved upon discontinuation of the subject’s participation in the study 
must be followed until recovered (returned to baseline), recovered with sequelae, or death (due to 
the SAE ). 
10.3. Abnormal Laboratory Values  
An abnormal laboratory value is considered to be an AE if the abnormality:  
 results in discontinuation from the study;  
 requires treatment, modification/ interruption of IP dose, or any other therapeutic 
intervent ion; or

process and/or organ toxicity, or is an exacerbation or worsening of an existing 
condition.  
Regardless of severity grade, only laboratory abnormalities that fu lfill a seriousness criterion 
need to be documented as a serious adverse event.  
If a laboratory abnormality is one component of a diagnosis or syndrome, then only the diagnosis 
or syndrome should be recorded on the AE/SAE page/screen of the eCRF. If the ab normality was 
not a part of a diagnosis or syndrome, then the laboratory abnormality should be recorded as the 
AE. If possible, the laboratory abnormality should be recorded as a medical term and not simply 
as an abnormal laboratory result (eg, record thro mbocytopenia rather than decreased platelets).  
10.4. Pregnancy  
All pregnancies or suspected pregnancies are immediately reportable events .   
10.4.1.  Females of Childbearing Potential – Collection of Pregnancy Information:  
Pregnancies and suspected pregnancies (including  elevated β-subunit of chorionic gonadotropin 
[βhCG] or positive pregnancy test in a female subject of childbearing potential regardless of 
disease state) occurring while the subject is on IP, or within 28 days  of the subject ’s last dose of 
IP, are conside red immediately reportable events. Investigational product is to be discontinued 
immediately and the subject instructed to return any unused portion of the IP to the Investigator. 
The pregnancy, suspected pregnancy, or positive pregnancy test must be repor ted to Amgen 
Global Patient Safety immediately by facsimile, email or other appropriate method, using the 
Pregnancy Notification Form or approved equivalent form (refer to Appen dix O ). The Pregnancy 
Notification Form must be submitted to Amgen Global Patient Safety within 24 hours of learning 
of a subject ’s pregnancy. (Note: Sites are not required to provide any infor mation on the 
Pregnancy Notification Form that violates the country or regions local privacy laws).  
After obtaining the female subject ’s signed consent for release of pregnancy and infant health 
information, the investigator will collect pregnancy and infant health information and complete 
the pregnancy questionnaire for any female subject who becomes pr egnant while taking IP 
through 28 days of the subject ’s last dose of IP. This information will be forwarded to Amgen 
Global Patient Safety. Generally, infant follow -up will be conducted 12 months after the birth of 
the child (if applicable).          
The female subject may be referred to an obstetrician -gynecologist or another appropriate 
healthcare professional for further evaluation.  
The Investigator will follow the female subject until completion of the pregnancy and must 
notify Amgen Global Patient Saf ety immediately about the outcome of the pregnancy (either 
normal or abnormal outcome).  
If the outcome of the pregnancy was abnormal (eg, spontaneous abortion), the Investigator 
should report the abnormal outcome as an AE. If the abnormal outcome meets an y of the serious 
criteria, it must be reported as an SAE to Amgen Global Patient  Safety using the paper Serious 
Adverse Event Report Form within 24 hours of the Investigator’s knowledge of the event.

causality, as SAEs. In addition, any infant death after 28 days that the Investigator suspects is 
related to in utero exposure to the IP should also be reported to Amgen Global Patient Safety by 
facsimile, email, or ot her appropriate method, within 24 hours of the Investigator’s knowledge of 
the event using the paper SAE Report Form.  
10.4.2.  Male Subjects With Partners Who Become Pregnant  
In the event a male subject fathers a child during treatment, and for an additional 28 d ays after 
discontinuing IP, the information will be recorded on the Pregnancy Notification Form (refer to 
Appendix O ). The form must be submitte d to Amgen Global Patient Safety with 24 hours of the 
investigator’s/site’s awareness of the pregnancy (Note: Sites are not required to provide any 
information on the Pregnancy Notification Form that violates the country or regions local 
privacy laws).  
The investigator will attempt to obtain a signed consent for release of pregnancy and infant 
health information directly from the pregnant female partner to obtain additional pregnancy 
information.    
After obtaining the female partner ’s signed consent for r elease of pregnancy and infant health 
information the investigator will collect pregnancy outcome and infant health information on the 
pregnant partner and her baby and complete the pregnancy questionnaires. This information will 
be forwarded to Amgen Glob al Patient Safety.      
Generally, infant follow -up will be conducted up to 12 months after the birth of the child (if 
applicable).  
Any termination of the pregnancy will be reported to Amgen Global Patient Safety regardless of 
fetal status (presence or absence of anomalies) or indication for procedure.  
10.4.3.  Collection of Lactation Information  
 Investigator will collect lactation informatio n on any female subject who breastfeeds 
while taking IP through 28 days post last dose of IP.   
 Information will be recorded on the Lactation Notification Form (refer to Appendix P ) 
and submitted by facsimile or email to Amgen Global Patient Safety within 24 hours of 
the investigator’s knowledge of event.   
 Study treatment will be discontinued if female subject breastfeeds during th e study.  
 With the female subjects signed consent for release of mother and infant health 
information, the investigator will collect mother and infant health information and 
complete the lactation questionnaire on any female subject who breastfeeds while ta king 
IP through 28 days after discontinuing IP.        
10.5. Reporting of Serious Adverse Events  
Any AE that meets any criterion for an SAE requires the completion of the AE/SAE page/screen 
of the eCRF and the completion of the paper Serious Adverse Event Report  Form ( refer to 
Appendix N ).  All SAEs must be reported to Amgen Global Patient Safety by facsimile or email 
via the paper Serious Adverse Event Report form within 24 hours of the Investigator ’s

reports.  
The Investigator is required to ensure that  the data on these forms is accurate and consistent.  This 
requirement applies to all SAEs (regardless of relationship to IP) that occur during the study 
(from the time the legal guardian signs informed consent and subject signs assent until 28 days 
after t he last dose of IP) or any SAE made known to the Investigator at any time following the 
protocol -required reporting period or after end of study. Serious adverse events occurring prior to 
treatment (after signing the ICF/assent) will be collected/recorded/ reported.  
Any follow -up data to the existing SAE should be resubmitted to Amgen Global Patient Safety.   
Where required by local legislation, the Investigator is responsible for informing the Institutional 
Review Board/Ethics Committee (IRB/EC) of the SAE and providing them with all relevant 
initial and follow -up information about the event. The Investigator must keep copies of all SAE 
source documents and all correspondence with the IRB/EC.  
Serious Adverse Event Reporting transmitted via paper Serious Adve rse Event Report Form:  
 Facsimile transmission of the Serious Adverse Event Report Form is the preferred 
method to transmit this information. If facsimile is unavailable, the email method to 
transmit this information is acceptable (refer to Appendix N ).     
 In rare circumstances and in the absence of facsimile equipment, this form may be sent 
via email,  or notification by telephone is acceptable with a copy of the Serious Adverse 
Event Report Form in English language sent by overnight mail or courier service.      
 Initial notification via telephone does not replace the need for the investigator to 
comple te and sign the Serious Adverse Event Report Form within the designated 
reporting timeframes.   
 Once the study has ended, serious adverse events (regardless of causality) should be 
reported to Amgen Global Patient Safety if the investigator becomes aware of them and 
may use the paper Serious Adverse Event Report Form (refer to Appendix N ).     
Serious adverse events reported outside of the protocol -required reporting period  will be 
captured within the safety database as clinical trial cases and handled accordingly based on 
relationship to investigational product.  
If further safety related data is needed to fulfill any regulatory reporting requirements for a 
reportable event,  then additional information may need to be collected from the subject's records 
after the subject ends the study.   
10.5.1.  Safety Queries  
Queries pertaining to SAEs will be communicated from Amgen Global Patient Safety to the site 
via Amgen’s safety query paper process ,or other appropriate method.   
10.6. Expedited Reporting of Adverse Events  
For the purpose of regulatory reporting, Amgen Global Patient Safety will determine the 
expectedness of events suspected of being related to apremilast  based on the Investigator

11.1. Treatment Discontinuation  
Subjects who have psoriasis disease flare during the apremilast treatment periods and require 
systemic conventional therapies, biologics, phototherapy, or prohibited topical therapies (defined 
in Section  8.1) will be discontinued from the study and properly treated according to local 
treatment guidelines. In the case of psoriasis disease flare during the apremilast treatment 
periods, the reason f or discontinuation will be lack of efficacy. Subjects will not be withdrawn 
from the study if the disease flare and the need for treatment occur during the follow -up periods. 
Every attempt will be made to collect all or specific final data on a discontinue d subject. Any 
subject whose calculated BMI falls below the 5th percentile on the CDC growth chart ( CDC, 
2000 ) at any visit will be discontinued from the study.  
The following events are considered sufficient reasons for disco ntinuing a subject from the 
investigational product(s):  
 Adverse Event  
 Lack of efficacy  
 Withdrawal by subject  
 Death  
 Lost to follow -up 
 Non-compliance with IP  
 Protocol deviation  
 Pregnancy  
 Physician decision  
 Study terminated by Sponsor  
 Other (to be specified on the CRF)  
The reason for discontinuation of treatment should be recorded in the CRF and in the source 
documents.  
When a subject is discontinued from treatment, the Investigator should make every attempt 
possible to have the subject evaluated at the Early  Termination Visit within 4 days of the last 
intake of IP.  
The decision to discontinue a subject from treatment remains the responsibility of the treating 
physician, which will not be delayed or refused by the Sponsor.  However, prior to discontinuing 
a subject, the Investigator may contact the Medical Monitor and forward appropriate supporting 
documents for review and discussion.

12.1. Emergency Contact  
In emergency situations, the Investigator should use their medical judgement to provide 
appropriate medical care of clinical trial subjects. The Investigator may also contact the 
responsible Clini cal Research Physician/Medical Monitor or designee by telephone at the 
number(s) listed on the Emergency Contact Information page of the protocol (after title page).  
In the unlikely event that the Clinical Research Physician/Medical Monitor or designee cannot be 
reached, the Investigator may also contact the Amgen Medical Information number at 1 -800-77-
AMGEN ( 1-800-772-6436 ). The representatives are responsible for obtaining your call -back 
information and contacting the on -call Amgen/contract research organization Medical Monitor, 
who will then contact you promptly.  
  
12.2. Emergency Identification of Investigational Products  
The blind must not be broken during the course of the study unless in the opinion of the 
Investigator, it is absolutely necessary to sa fely treat the subject. If it is medically imperative to 
know what IP the subject is receiving, IP should be temporarily discontinued if, in the opinion of 
the Investigator, continuing IP can negatively affect the outcome of the subject’s treatment.    
The decision to break the blind in emergency situations remains the responsibility of the treating 
physician, which will not be delayed or refused by the Sponsor. However, the Investigator may 
contact the Medical Monitor prior to breaking the blind to discuss unblinding, mainly in the 
interest of the subject.  
The Investigator should ensure that the code is broken only in accordance with the protocol. The 
Investigator should promptly notify the Medical Monitor of the emergency unblinding and the 
reason for brea king the blind, which should be clearly documented by the Investigator in the 
subject’s source documentation.  
Emergency unblinding should only be performed by the Investigator through the IRT by using an 
emergency unblinding personal identification number (PIN), and the Investigator should call IRT 
for unblended dose information.

Investigator abide by Good Clinical Practice (GCP), as described in International Council for 
Harmonisation (ICH) Guideline E6 and in accordance with the general ethical principles outlined 
in the De claration of Helsinki. The study will receive approval from an IRB/EC prior to 
commencement. The Investigator will conduct all aspects of this study in accordance with 
applicable national, state, and local laws of the pertinent regulatory authorities.  
13.2. Inve stigator Responsibilities  
Investigator responsibilities are set out in the ICH Guideline for Good Clinical Practice and in 
the local regulations.  Amgen staff or an authorized representative will evaluate and approve all 
Investigators who in turn will sele ct their staff. The specific study -appropriate qualifications of 
each investigator are assessed during the site feasibility and selection process.  
The Investigator should ensure that all persons assisting with the study are adequately informed 
about the p rotocol, amendments, study treatments, as well as study -related duties and functions, 
including obligations of confidentiality of Amgen information. The Investigator should maintain 
a list of Sub -investigators and other appropriately qualified persons to w hom he or she has 
delegated significant study -related duties.  
The Investigator is responsible for keeping a record of all subjects who complete the informed 
consent/assent process and are screened for entry into the study.  Subjects who fail Screening 
must  have the reason(s) recorded in the subject’s source documents.  
The Investigator, or a designated member of the Investigator’s staff, must be available during 
monitoring visits to review data, resolve queries and allow direct access to subject records 
(eg, medical records, office charts, hospital charts, and study -related charts) for source data 
verification. The Investigator must ensure timely and accurate completion of CRFs and queries.  
The information contained in the protocol and amendments (with the ex ception of the 
information provided by Amgen on public registry websites) is considered Amgen confidential 
information. Only information that is previously disclosed by Amgen on a public registry 
website may be freely disclosed by the Investigator or its i nstitution, or as outlined in the Clinical 
Trial Agreement. Amgen protocol, amendment and IB information is not to be made publicly 
available (for example on the Investigator’s or their institution’s website) without express written 
approval from Amgen. In formation proposed for posting on the Investigator’s or their 
institution’s website must be submitted to Amgen for review and approval, providing at least 
5 business days for review.

Both an age -specific assent (by the study subject) and an informed consent form (ICF; by 
subject’s legal guardian) must be signed before any study -related assessments are performed . 
Documentation that the subject assent and legal guardian informed consent occurred prior to the 
study subject’s entry into the study and of the assent/informed consent process should be 
recorded in the study subject’s source documents including the date. The original assent and 
informed consent documents signed and dated  by the study subject (assent), subject’s legal 
guardian (ICF), and by the person facilitating the process (assent and ICF), prior to the study 
subject’s entry into the study, must be maintained in the Investigator’s study files and a copy 
given to the stu dy subject’s legal guardian. In addition, if a protocol is amended and it impacts 
on the content of the assent and informed consent, the two documents must be revised. Study 
subjects participating in the study, and their legal guardians, must repeat the as senting/consenting 
process with the revised assent/consent documents when the amended protocol is implemented. 
The revised documents signed and dated by the study subject, subject’s legal guardian, and by 
the person facilitating the process, must be mainta ined in the Investigator’s study files and a copy 
given to the study subject’s legal guardian.  
13.4. Confidentiality  
Amgen affirms the subject's right to protection against invasion of privacy and to be in 
compliance with ICH and other local regulations (whichev er is most stringent). Amgen requires 
the Investigator to permit Amgen's representatives and, when necessary, representatives from 
regulatory authorities, to review and/or copy any medical records relevant to the study in 
accordance with local laws.  
Should  direct access to medical records require a waiver or authorization separate from the 
signed ICF and assent, it is the responsibility of the Investigator to obtain such permission in 
writing from the appropriate individual.  
13.5. Protocol Amendments  
Any amendmen t to this protocol must be approved by the Amgen  Clinical Research 
Physician/Medical Monitor. Amendments will be submitted to the IRB/EC for written approval. 
Written approval must be obtained before implementation of the amended version occurs. The 
writte n signed approval from the IRB/EC should specifically reference the Investigator name, 
protocol number, study title and amendment number(s) that is applicable. Amendments that are 
administrative in nature do not require IRB/IEC approval but will be submitt ed to the IRB/IEC 
for information purposes.  
13.6. Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics Committee Review 
and Approval  
Before the start of the study, the study protocol, legal guardian ICF, subject assents, and any 
other appropriate documents will be subm itted to the IRB/EC with a cover letter or a form listing 
the documents submitted, their dates of issue, and the site (or region or area of jurisdiction, as 
applicable) for which approval is sought. If applicable, the documents will also be submitted to

All aspects of the study will be carefully monitored by Amgen or its authorized representative 
for compliance with applicable government regulations with respect to current GCP and SOPs.  
15.1. Study Monitoring and Source Data Verification  
Amgen ensures that appropriate monitoring procedures are performed before, during and after 
the study. All aspects of the study are review ed with the Investigator and the staff at a study 
initiation visit and/or at an Investigators’ Meeting. Prior to enrolling subjects into the study, an 
Amgen representative will review the protocol, CRFs, procedures for obtaining informed 
consent, record ke eping, and reporting of AEs/SAEs with the Investigator. Monitoring will 
include on -site visits with the Investigator and his/her staff as well as any appropriate 
communications by mail, email, fax, or telephone. During monitoring visits, the facilities, 
investigational product storage area, CRFs, subject’s source documents, and all other study 
documentation will be inspected/reviewed by the Amgen representative in accordance with the 
Study Monitoring Plan.  
Accuracy will be checked by performing source data verification that is a direct comparison of 
the entries made onto the CRFs against the appropriate source documentation. Any resulting 
discrepancies will be reviewed with the Investigator and/or his/her staff. Any necessary 
corrections will be made directl y to the CRFs or via queries by the Investigator and/or his/her 
staff. Monitoring procedures require that informed consents, adherence to inclusion/exclusion 
criteria and documentation of SAEs and their proper recording be verified. Additional 
monitoring a ctivities may be outlined in a study -specific monitoring plan.  
15.2. Audits and Inspections  
In addition to the routine monitoring procedures, a Quality, Compliance & Audit, Learning & 
Performance unit exists within Amgen. Representatives of this unit will conduc t audits of clinical 
research activities in accordance with Amgen SOPs to evaluate compliance with Good Clinical 
Practice guidelines and regulations.  
The Investigator is required to permit direct access to the facilities where the study took place, 
source documents, CRFs and applicable supporting records of study subject participation for 
audits and inspections by IRB/ECs, regulatory authorities (eg, Food and Drug Administration 
[FDA], European Medicines Agency [EMA], Health Canada) and company authorized 
representatives. The Investigator should make every effort to be available for the audits and/or 
inspections. If the Investigator is contacted by any regulatory authority regarding an inspection, 
he/she should contact Amgen immediately.

 Gently invert the tube 3 to 5  times and immediately immerse it into ice to prevent 
possible compound degradation.  
PK Blood Sample Processing to Obtain Plasma  
 Within 30  minutes of collection, the blood sample must be centrifuged at 1,500  g 
(about 3,000  rpm) for 10  minutes at 4°C to obtain plasma.   
 Immediately record the time of sample entry into and out of the centrifuge.  
 Transfer approximately 0.5  mL of plasma in to each of the two pre -labeled, pre -
chilled, citric acid -containing polypropylene storage tubes  (one primary and one 
back -up). 
 Gently invert the tube 3 to 5  times.  
Note: Amgen will provide these tubes.  
 Keep storage tubes on ice before they are ready to be transferred into a freezer.  
 Within 60 minutes of blood collection , transfer plasma samples in storage vials into 
a –70oC freezer, where they will remain stored until shipping.  
 Immediately record the time of sample entry into the freezer.

Protocol  Amendment 2 has been written to implement changes to the study  for all  parti cipat ing 
sites. The intent of the amendment is to include descript ions of the redesi gned packaging of 
investi gational product (IP) as well as a statement that IP will be s upplied during the Apremilast 
Extensio n Phase in a blister pack for the first month and then in bottles for the rest of the study .
Significant changes included in this amendment are summarized below:
1.Removed previ ous depict ions of IP blister card packaging and repl aced them  with 
depictions of the redesi gned versio ns.

were superfluous and not needed to ensure protection of the blind.
Revised sect ion: Appendix M
2.Added text that informs of switch fro m blister card supplied IP to bottles during the 
Apremilast Extensio n Phase and provided an updated text description of the redesigned 
blister cards.
Revised sect ions: Protocol  Summary; Section 7 Descript ion of Study  Treatments
3.Revised platelet ranges for subject eligibilit y.
It was learned during the study  that the upper limit  of the allowable platelet range was 
unnecessarily too low and could be raised safely  to m ore cl osely align with what is ty pically seen 
in this disease popul ation.
Revised sect ion: Section 4.2 Inclusio n Cri teria, Inclusio n Cri terion number 11
4.Removed pregnancies of partners of male subjects as an event that must be reported.

1.Added a new inclusion criterion for baseline minimum allowable body mass index 
(BMI) 
The am endment adds a new Inclusi on Criterion which provides a specific minimum for 
subject BMI in order to ensure that no underweight subjects are enrolled. The Otezla®

warnings and precautions for use ;this new inclusion criterion will exclude underweight 
subjects fro m the study .
Revised Sect ion: Section 4.2 Inclusion Criteri on #3
2.Added a specific BMI parameter as a reason for mandatory subject withdrawal .

Revised Sect ion: Section 11.1 Treatment Discont inuat ion
3.Revised hemoglobin rangesfor subject eligibility
This was an update made to the allowable upper ranges of entrance hemoglo bin values in 
response to feedback fro m an active study  invest igator. The higher limits of the hemoglo bin 
ranges were considered to be too low, which would make enro llment of study  subjects 
unnecessarily challenging. The inclusio n hemoglo bin ranges were reviewed by  the Celgene 
safet y physician (execut ive director) and new ranges were approved which are wider but still 
well within established normal ranges for this pati ent popul ation.
Age (years) Males (g/dL) Females (g/dL)
6-11 10.0 –13.515.0 10.0 –13.515.0
12-18 11.0 – 1416.5 10.5 –14.015.5

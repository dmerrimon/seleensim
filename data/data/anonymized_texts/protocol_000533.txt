CONFIDENTIAL vi CONFIDENTIALxTo compare ORR in patients with metastatic PDAC treated with BB I 608 plus 
weekly nab paclitaxel with gemcitabine versus weekly nab paclit axel with 
gemcitabine in biomarker positive patients.
Study Design: This is a randomized, open-label, multi-center, phase III study o f BBI-608 plus weekly 
nab-paclitaxel with gemcitabine (Arm 1) vs. weekly nab-paclitaxel  with gemcitabine
(Arm 2) for adult patients with metastatic PDAC.
1132 patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio, stratified acco rding to geographical 
region (North America/Western Europe/Australia vs. Japan/Korea vs. Rest o f the 
World), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance st atus (0 vs. 1), 
and presence of liver metastases (yes vs. no). Enrollment was c ompleted prior to this 
amendment.  
Until the time of this amendment, the study proceeded in 28-day (4-week) cycles. BBI-
608 was administered orally, twice daily, with doses separated by appro ximately 12 
hours. BBI-608 administration began 2-5 days prior to the first nab-paclitaxel with 
gemcitabine infusion. Nab-paclitaxel 125 mg/m2immediately followed by 
gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2were administered on Days 1, 8 and 15 of every 28-day cycle
via intravenous infusion.  
From the time of this amendment, and since the outcome of the i nterim analysis which 
was futile, patients may continue protocol therapy if it is bel ieved to be in their best 
interest by the investigator and patient, and with the patient’ s informed consent.
Patients will receive BBI-608, nab-paclitaxel and/or gemcitabin e at the same dose and 
schedule that they were receiving prior to the amendment. Patien ts on Arm 1 may 
continue BBI-608 with the Sponsor’s approval. Patients on Arm 1  m a y  a l s o  
discontinue BBI-608 but choose to continue with nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine
alone.  
Tumor assessments will be performed every 8 weeks after randomi zation until 
objective disease progression or  treatment discontinuation due to toxicity.
The protocol will continue to be followed for all endpoints unt il study completion. The 
study is planned for completion on February 28th, 2020. 
Study Population: This study will enroll patients with histologically or cytologi cally confirmed 
adenocarcinoma of the pancreas that is metastatic (Stage IV). Patients with local 
recurrence following surgical resection will be excluded. At ra ndomization, patients 
will not have received systemic chemotherapy for metastatic pan creatic 
adenocarcinoma previously (with a fluoropyrimidine or gemcitabi ne administered as
a radiation sensitizer in the adjuvant setting allowed). Other i nclusion criteria for all 
patients include: age \ ears(&2*SHUIRUPDQFHVWDWXVDQGDGHTXDWHKHSDWLF
renal, and bone-marrow function.  
Test Product, 
Dose, and Mode of 
Administration:Until the time of this amendment, patients randomized to Arm 1 o n this study received
BBI-608 orally, daily, at 240 mg bid (480 mg total daily dose).  BBI-608 was taken 
daily continuously throughout each 4 week (28 day) study cycle i n combination with 
nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine. BBI-608 was administered twice dai ly, one hour prior 
or two hours after meals, with the  first dose taken in the morn ing and doses separated 
by approximately 12 hours. 
Patients randomized to Arm 1 received BBI-608 in combination wit h nab-paclitaxel
and gemcitabine. Patients randomized to Arm 2 received nab-pacli taxel and 
gemcitabine alone. Nab-paclitaxel 125 mg/m2was administered intravenously starting

Amendment #5 
  
CONFIDENTIAL vii CONFIDENTIALon Day 1 of Cycle 1. Gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2was administered intravenously
following nab-paclitaxel infusion. This regimen was repeated on Days 1, 8 and 15 of 
every 28-day cycle.
Dose modification of BBI-608 and/ or nab-paclitaxel and/or gemci tabine was allowed.
There were no dose reductions or adjustments for lymphopenia or  alopecia.  
From the time of this amendment, and since the outcome of the i nterim analysis was 
communicated to investigators, patients may continue protocol t herapy if it is believed
to be in their best interest by the investigator and patient, and  with the patient’s 
informed consent. Patients will receive BBI-608, nab-paclitaxel  and/or gemcitabine at 
the same dose and schedule that they were receiving prior to th e amendment. Patients 
on Arm 1 may continue BBI-608 with the Sponsor’s approval. Pati ents on Arm 1 may 
discontinue BBI-608 but choose t o continue with nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine.. 
Duration of 
Treatment: Patients may continue to receive assigned protocol therapy as l ong as they have not 
experienced any adverse events requiring permanent discontinuation of study 
medication, have not demonstrated disease progression based on R esponse Evaluation 
Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 criteria, it is believed to  be in the patient’s best 
interest by the investigator and patient, or until February 28th, 2020, whichever occurs 
first. If nab-paclitaxel and/or gemcitabine is/are discontinued du e to toxicity, BBI-608 
may be continued until another discontinuation criterion is met with the Sponsor’s 
approval, if it is believed to be in the patient’s best interest  by the investigator and 
patient, and with the patient’s informed consent. If BBI-608 is  discontinued due to 
toxicity, nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine may be continue d until another 
discontinuation criterion is met. 
The study is planned for completion on February 28th, 2020. 
Statistical 
Methods: The primary study endpoint is Overall Survival (OS), defined as  t h e  t i m e  f r o m  
randomization until death from any cause.  
A multiplicity adjustment strategy will be applied to control t he overall Type I error 
rate with respect to several sources of multiplicity in the tri al. This multiplicity 
adjustment will account for the analysis of the treatment effec t on the primary (OS) 
and key secondary (PFS, DCR, ORR) endpoints.
The study is designed to have a power of 90% and a one-sided al pha of 2.5% to detect 
a 20% reduction in the continuous risk of death (HR 0.80, which  corresponds to an 
increase of median survival from 8.5 to 10.63 months) in the In tention to Treat (ITT) 
general study population. It is estimated that 864 events will b e required to detect this 
reduction which would be observed by randomizing 1132 patients e nrolled over 24 
months with patient follow up for  an additional 12 months, for total study duration of 
36 months. It is anticipated that up to 5% dropout rate will oc cur for the entire study.  
The primary hypothesis is: 
H0: BBI-608 + nab-paclitaxel with gemcitabine QDE -paclitaxel with gemcitabine 
versus
H1: BBI-608+ nab-paclitaxel with gemcitabine > nab-paclitaxel with g emcitabine. 
This hypothesis will be evaluated for the superiority of BBI-60 8 by performing a 
stratified log-rank test adjusting for the stratification varia bles at randomization. The 
final analysis will be perfor med when 864 OS events have been o bserved.

CONFIDENTIAL viii CONFIDENTIALThe overall power of the study will be approximately 90% after the multiplicity control 
procedure is considered.
Prior to this amendment, there was one interim analysis presente d to the independent 
Data Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB). Additionally, the DSMB reviewed safety 
during conduct of the study. The role and responsibility of the  DSMB are defined in a 
separate Charter.
The interim analysis involved a stratified log-rank test. Nominal  p-values were based 
on the Lan-DeMets error spending function using an O’Brien- Fleming stopping 
boundary in order to preserve the overall one-sided alpha level  at 0.025.  
The interim analysis was performed when approximately 432 deaths  (50% of the 
required events) were observed. The interim analysis was for futilit y only, with the
futility boundary set at HR > 1.

CONFIDENTIAL 5 CONFIDENTIAL2.0 BACKGROUND INFORMATION AND RATIONALE
2.1 PANCREATIC DUCTAL ADENOCARCINOMA
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the most common form  of pancreatic cancer with the 
worst prognosis of all solid tumors (Corbo, 2012; Klimstra, 2007) . PDAC is the fourth leading cause 
of cancer death in the United States with an estimate of 38,460  deaths closely following the number
of 45,220 diagnoses in 2013 (Siegel, 2013) . Surgery is considered the only potentially curative 
treatment, however, more than 80% of patients present with loca lly advanced or metastatic disease 
(Davis, 2012) . Out of the minority of presenting patients who qualify for cu rative surgery, most will 
develop disseminated advanced disease with a 5-year survival ra te of less than 5% (Hidalgo, 2010) .
Standard treatment for unresectable and metastatic disease curr ently includes first-line combination 
regimen with FOLFIRINOX (5-FU, leucovorin, irinotecan and oxali platin), a regimen that provides a 
median overall survival (OS) of 11.1 months in patients with tr eatment-naïve disease (Conroy, 2011) .
Moreover, a number of uncontrolled studies have shown that modi fied FOLFIRINOX 
(mFOLFIRINOX) regimen results in decreased toxicity while maint aining efficacy in patients with 
pancreatic adenocarcinoma (Blazer, 2015; Mahaseth, 2013) . Most recently, a liposomal irinotecan 
formulation was shown to improve overall survival by 1.9 months (6.1 months vs 4.2 months) in 
combination with 5-FU and leucovorin in patients with metastatic  PDAC progressing on gemcitabine-
based first-line treatment as compared to patients treated with  5-FU and leucovorin alone  (Chen, 2015). 
An alternative regimen for this patient population is a combina tion of nab-paclitaxel with gemcitabine.
A recent updated survival analysis of the phase II/III study, MP ACT (Von Hoff, 2013) , randomizing 
861 patients with metastatic PDAC to gemcitabine versus gemcita bine in combination with nab-
paclitaxel, revealed a sustained difference in OS between the 2  arms with median survival of 8.7 
months in the combination group compared to 6.6 months in the g emcitabine monotherapy group and 
more importantly a first ever 3-year survival rate of 4% in the  combination treatment group (Goldstein,
2014) . These results encourage continued efforts to build upon these  backbones to further extend 
s u r v i v a l .  C u r r e n t l y ,  a  p a t i e n t  w i t h  a d v a n c e d  d i s e a s e  p r o g r e s s i n g in first-line therapy has limited 
treatment options. Given the morbidity associated with this dis ease, there is an urgent need to identify 
novel therapies to improve the outcome of patients with advance d unresectable PDAC. 
2.2 CANCER STEM CELLS (CSC) AND PDAC
CSCs or cancer cells with stemness phenotypes are a sub-populat ion of cancer cells that have self-
renewal capability, are highly malignant and are considered to be fundamentally responsible for 
malignant growth, recurrence, drug-resistance and metastasis. M oreover, CSCs are highly resistant to 
chemotherapies and current targeted agents. CSCs have been isol ated from almost all major tumor 
types, including PDAC (Lee, 2008; Boman, 2008; Clevers, 2011; Gupta, 2009; Hanahan, 2011; 
Gupta, 2011) .
Accumulating evidence indicates that CSCs may play a key role in the pathogenesis of PDAC ( Lee, 
2008) . Cancer stem cells have been isolated from human pancreatic ade nocarcinomas using a
combination of three cell surface markers including CD44, CD24, and ESA (Li, 2007). These CSCs 
isolated from pancreatic adenocarcinoma patients display tumour- initiating properties ( Shah, 2007; Li, 
2007) . Additionally, the CD133 cell surface marker also discriminate s for pancreatic cancer cells with 
potent proliferative capacity (Hermann, 2007) and pancreatic cancer cells positive for both CD133 and 
CXCR4 cell surface markers have the ability to migrate and meta stasize in addition to having a potent 
CanStem111P
Protocol Date: 2019-JUL-31
Amendment #5 
  
CONFIDENTIAL 6 CONFIDENTIALproliferative capacity ( Hermann, 2007) . Moreover, CSCs in PDAC display resistance to therapeutics 
as it has been observed that treatment with ionizing radiation a nd chemotherapy results in enrichment 
of cancer stem cells in pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Exposure of pancreatic cancer cell line to 
gemcitabine results in enrichment of the CSC population ( Hermann, 2007; Hong, 2009) . Finally, as is 
the case with other cancers including colorectal, breast, prost ate, and ovarian carcinoma, expression 
of CSC markers in pancreatic tumors correlates with diminished survival (Rasheed, 2012; Maeda, 
2008; Ohara, 2013) . These findings suggest that the development of cancer stem cel l inhibitors may 
represent a novel strategy for potential use in the treatment of PDAC.
2.3 BBI-608 
BBI-608 (also called napabucasi n, BBI608, BB608) is a small mol ecule that is hypothesized to affect 
multiple oncogenic cellular pathways, including inhibition of t he STAT3 pathway, which has been 
implicated in cancer stem cell viability. For further pre-clini cal information, please refer to the 
Investigator Brochure.
BBI-608 has been evaluated in multiple clinical trials as both a monotherapy and as a component of 
combination therapy with standard anti-cancer therapeutics. Ava ilable data from many of these trials, 
including detailed adverse event (AE) tables and pharmacokineti c information, can be found in the IB.  
Highlighted below are general information on the BBI-608 safety  p r o f i l e  a n d  a  s u m m a r y  o f  t h e  
BBI608-118 (aka BBI608-201PANC) phase I/II clinical trial of BB I-608 in combination with standard 
chemotherapy for advanced PDAC.
2.3.1 Pre-Clinical Rationale
The pre-clinical rationale for the development of BBI-608 can b e found in the Investigator Brochure. 
2.3.2 Safety Profile
The predominant adverse drug reactions (ADRs) associated with B BI-608 are gastrointestinal in 
nature. BBI-608 appears to irritate the gastrointestinal epithe lium, which can result in diarrhea, 
abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and decreased appetite (anore xia). Fatigue is also reported.  
These ADRs are predominantly mild (grade 1 or grade 2), but can  be severe (grade 3). Gastrointestinal 
or other ADRs that are grade 4 in severity are rare (<1%). Howe ver, even mild or moderate events, if 
persistent, can result in dehydration; which, if severe, can le ad to other events such as hypovolemia, 
hypotension, electrolyte abnormalities, and increased serum cre atinine/acute kidney injury. Other 
sequelae such as dizziness or falls could also occur.  
The common ADRs for BBI-608 are shown in Table 1 below. The table shows two sets of frequencies 
or rates. The first set (3rdcolumn) is the range of rates reported for each event as a non- serious 
occurrence across the clinical trials. Different rates are obse rved in each trial because of different study 
populations and the different combination therapeutics involved . The second set of rates (4th column) 
is the overall frequency in which the event is reported as a se rious adverse drug reaction.

2.3.3 BBI-608 for Pancreatic Cancer 
The BBI608-118 (aka BBI608-201PANC) study was initiated to eval uate BBI-608 in combination 
with standard chemotherapy for advanced PDAC. The primary objec tives of the study included 
determination of the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic char acteristics, and recommended phase II 
dose (RP2D) of BBI-608 in combination with each of the backbone  regimens. Secondary objectives 
included evaluation of preliminary anti-tumor activity. The stu dy has completed accrual and analysis 
is ongoing. 
Patients with PDAC were eligible if they were appropriate to re ceive treatment with one of several 
standard regimens for advanced pancreatic cancer: albumin-bound  paclitaxel (nab-paclitaxel) plus 
gemcitabine, FOLFIRINOX, liposomal irinotecan (Onivyde [MM-398] ) plus 5FU/Leucovorin, or 
FOLFIRI. The trial was not randomized and a treatment arm was se lected by investigators based on 
the specific clinical context for each patient. 
Once enrolled, patients received twice daily administration of BBI-608 in combination with a standard 
chemotherapeutic backbone as set forth above. RP2D was determined  to be 240 mg BID (480 mg total 
daily) for all combination arms. 
In the BBI-608 in combination with gemcitabine plus nab-paclitax el study arm, patients received 
gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2intravenously plus nab-paclitaxel 125 mg/m2intravenously on days 1, 8, and
15 of a 28-day study cycle. Dose adjustment of either BBI-608 o r gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel (either 
agent) was permitted in the event of toxicity.
Out of 71 patients enrolled, a total of 66 patients had not pre viously received BBI-608. A majority of 
these patients had not received any systemic therapy, with appr oximately 25% having received 
adjuvant therapy with recurrence at less than 6 months of the l ast adjuvant dose.  
As of September 1, 2017, 64 out of the 66 patients enrolled had  protocol treatment dose-administration 
confirmed in the study database. These 64 patients were include d in an analysis of safety and efficacy. 
Objective response per RECIST 1.1 was observed in 31 (48%) of p atients, including 2 (3%) with 
complete response (CR) and 29 (45%) with partial response (PR).  An additional 19 (30%) patients had

CONFIDENTIAL 9 CONFIDENTIALBBI-608 at a dose of 240 mg BID (480 mg total daily) combined w ith a standard regimen of 
gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel was tolerated in patients with a dvanced pancreatic cancer.  The clinical 
activity observed in the BBI608-118 (BBI608-201PANC) study, pai red with the unmet medical need 
for additional effective therapies in pancreatic cancer, provid es a rationale for further clinical 
investigation. CanStem111P is designed to evaluate the role of BBI-608 in combination with nab-

This is an international multi-center, prospective, open label,  randomized phase III trial of BBI-608 
plus nab-paclitaxel with gemcitabine (Arm 1) versus nab-paclitaxel with gemcitabine (Arm 2) in adult 
patients with metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma.
Following the interim analysis, the trial will continue with pat ients who have not yet achieved the 
primary study endpoint (death), and with patients currently on protocol therapy and who may receive 
BBI-608 and/or gemcitabine and/or nab-paclitaxel on study based  on the clinical judgement of the 
investigator that this is in the patient’s best interest, provi ded the patient is fully informed, in agreement
and has provided consent. Patients will receive protocol treatm ent until any of the discontinuation 
criteria are met or until February 28th, 2020, whichever occurs  first. The protocol will continue to be 
followed for all endpoints until study completion.  
3.1 STRATIFICATION
At randomization, patients will be stratified by:
1. Geographical region (North America/Western Europe/Australia v s. Japan/Korea vs. Rest of the 
World)  
2. ECOG performance status (ECOG 0 vsECOG 1) 
3. Presence of liver metastases (yes vs no) 
3.2 RANDOMIZATION
Patients will be randomized to the study according to a 1:1 rati o using a permuted block randomization 
procedure to receive one of the following 2 treatments:
1. Arm 1: BBI-608 plus nab-paclitaxel with gemcitabine  
2. Arm 2: nab-paclitaxel with gemcitabine

Repeat of screening laboratory testing will be allowed only in case of laboratory error. Otherwise, re-
screening will not be allowed for patients who screen fail duri ng initial screening procedures. 
Following Sponsor approval of patient eligibility pre-randomiza tion, patients will be randomized. All 
randomizations will be done through the randomization and trial  supply management (RTSM) system.
Complete details regarding obtaining a password, accessing the system and registering/randomizing 
patients will be provided at the time of study activation.  
All patients screened for the study by the participating treatm ent center will be assigned a subject 
screening number and all eligible patients enrolled on the stud y will be assigned an additional subject 
randomization number; these must be used on all documentation a nd correspondence. 
The following information will be required:
xpatient’s date of birth (as allowed by local regulations) and a ge 
xpatient's initials (as allowed by local regulations)  
xconfirmation of the requirements listed in sections 4.1 and 4.2  
xstratification factors

The permuted block randomization procedure will balance between  treatment arms within each of the 
following stratification factors:
xGeographical region (North America/Western Europe/Australia vs.  Japan/Korea vs. Rest of the 
World)  
xECOG performance status (0 vs. 1)
xPresence of liver metastases (yes vs. no)
6.3 RANDOMIZATION
Patients will be randomized 1:1 between the two treatment arms and the randomization will be 
provided electronically (via RTSM). 
Note: The validity of results of the trial depends on the authe nticity of, and the follow-up of, all 
patients entered into the trial. Under no circumstances, theref ore, may an allocated patient’s data be 
withdrawn prior to final analysis, unless the participant withd raws from the trial and requests that data 
collection/submission cease from the point in time of withdrawa l.
All eligible patients randomized to the trial will be followed by the coordinating center. It is the 
responsibility of the physician investigator to have full satis faction in that the patient is indeed eligible 
before requesting randomization.

CONFIDENTIAL 26 CONFIDENTIALThe major adverse events associated with the use of BBI-608 are gastrointestinal events (nausea, 
diarrhea, and abdominal cramping) and fatigue. Fatigue is often  secondary to gastrointestinal events. 
There is no hematologic toxicity associated with BBI-608. We st rongly recommend that pre-existing 
laxative bowel regimens, such as stool softeners, be held start ing the day prior to first dose of study 
treatment and may be resumed in cases of no bowel movement duri ng the first 2 days of protocol 
treatment. Fiber supplementation may be continued. Additionally , prophylactic anti-diarrheal 
medications, such as Loperamide and/or Diphenoxylate/Atropine, starting 1 day prior to start of BBI-
608 are strongly recommended for all patients without history of c onstipation (just prior to 
randomization) for the first 4 weeks of study treatment with BBI -608. Antidiarrheal prophylaxis should 
be held if constipation develops. Details regarding the use of p rophylactic medication for the 
management of common BBI-608 related gastrointestinal adverse e vents are specified in the 
supplementary Adverse Event Management handout as well as in th e Pharmacy Manual.

Anti-Emetic Prophylaxis
Initial antiemetic prophylaxis is strongly recommended with a 5 HT3 agent (PO or IV) in combination 
with dexamethasone 8 or 10 mg (PO or IV) prior to administratio n of Gemcitabine. Dexamethasone 
may be continued at the dose of 4 mg twice daily or three times  daily for 3-4 days at the Investigator’s 
discretion. If a patient experiences nausea and/or vomiting fol lowing the first dose, Institutional 
guidelines and Investigator’s recommendations should be followe d for breakthrough antiemetic 
management.  
Hematopoietic Support Administration
G-CSF support may be given according to Institutional standards  for the treatment of neutropenia 
and/or thrombocytopenia, neutropenic fever or infections associ ated with neutropenia and for the 
prevention of febrile neutropenia in patients with an ANC < 500  cells/ml. Patients not experiencing 
resolution of neutropenia within 21 days, despite uninterrupted  granulocyte stimulating factor 
treatment, will discontinue study treatment. Erythropoietin may be administered at the discretion of 
the Investigator, consistent with Institutional guidelines.

CONFIDENTIAL 27 CONFIDENTIALSepsis Prophylaxis 
At the first occurrence of fever > 38.5 0C, patients should be instructed to immediately contact their 
physician. Prophylactic institution of broad-spectrum antibioti cs (such as amoxicillin/clavulanate 500 
mg PO 2-3 times daily) should be considered for febrile patient s at the Investigator discretion and/or 
as per Institutional standards. On day of randomization, patien ts should be provided with enough 
antibiotic for use at home, and they should be instructed to be gin taking it when they first record a 
temperature of > 38.5 0C (or if they feel they are developing a fever and a thermomete r is not available). 
They should also immediately contact their physician for guidan ce on where to go for blood counts to 
be evaluated for sepsis as soon as possible. Hospitalization or  evaluation in the emergency room may 
be required depending on their clinical presentation. Administra tion of prophylactic antibiotics to 
otherwise uncomplicated patients with biliary stents will be at  the discretion of the Investigator. Biliary 
stents should be monitored closel y to determine need for replac ement. 
Due to increased risk of sepsis in patients >80 years old, cand idate patients in this age group should 
be carefully followed clinically throughout study treatment. Th is patient population will also be 
carefully monitored by the independent DSMB. 
7.4 BBI-608 DOSE MODIFICATION
The major adverse events associated with the use of BBI-608 are gastrointestinal events (nausea, 
diarrhea, and abdominal cramping) and fatigue. Fatigue is often  secondary to gastrointestinal events. 
There is no hematologic toxicity associated with BBI-608. We re commend that pre-exiting laxative 
bowel regimens, such as stool softeners, be held starting the d ay prior to first dose of BBI-608 
treatment and may be resumed in cases of no bowel movement duri ng the first 2 days of BBI-608 
treatment. Fiber supplementation may be continued. Additionally , prophylactic anti-diarrheal 
medications, such as Loperamide and/or Diphenoxylate/Atropine, starting 1 day prior to start of BBI-
608 are strongly recommended for all patients treated with BBI-60 8. 
The guidelines that follow outline dosing modifications and rec ommended interventions should the 
above adverse events occur. 
Adverse events will be graded using the NCI Common Terminology C riteria for Adverse Events 
(CTCAE) Version 4.0 (see Appendix IV). If a patient experiences se veral adverse events and there are 
conflicting recommendations, please use the recommended dose ad justment that reduces the dose to 
the lowest level.

adverse events are specified in the supplementary Adverse Event  Management handout as well as in 
the Pharmacy Manual.
7.4.1 Hematologic Adverse EventsNo hematologic toxicity related to BBI-608 treatment has been o bserved. Should a study subject 
experience a Grade 1 or 2 hematologic adverse event, dosing may  continue while an alternate 
explanation is sought and/or a therapeutic intervention is unde rtaken.  
In the unlikely event of a Grade 3 or 4 hematologic adverse eve nt, continued dosing will be at the 
discretion of the study Investigator. Since a Grade 3 or 4 hema tologic event attributed to BBI-608 has 
not been reported, a prompt evaluation for an alternate explana tion is strongly recommended.  
7.4.2 Non-Hematologic (Gastrointestinal) Adverse Events
The dose modifications above should be followed in the occurrenc e of gastrointestinal adverse events 
or in the event of their sequelae. BBI-608 dose modification sh ould not be followed for non-
gastrointestinal events as they are not expected with use of BB I-608. Toxic effects will be graded using 
the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 4.0 (Appendix IV).  
7.4.3 Other Situations Change in Urine Color and Odor: Occasionally, subjects have reported an orange-brown color chan ge 
to their urine. Rarely, subjects also report a new odor to thei r urine. All subjects should be made aware 
of the possibility of these effects. Dosing can be continued in  the presence of these events. 
7.5 NAB-PACLITAXEL AND GEMCITABINE DOSE MODIFICATION
Dose modifications for hematologic and non-hematologic toxiciti es (using NCI CTCAE Version 4.0) 
expected from nab-paclitaxel with gemcitabine should be performe d according to the 
recommendations outlined below. Dose modifications for non-gast rointestinal toxicities expected 
from nab-paclitaxel with gemcitabine may also follow institutio nal guidelines. There will no dose 
reductions or adjustments for lymphopenia or alopecia. Dose lev el modifications of nab-paclitaxel and 
gemcitabine will occur at two dose levels. Any toxicity requirin g dose level modification beyond the 
second dose modification warrants treatment discontinuation. An y further dose modification may be 
allowed in line with clinical practice per Sponsor and Investig ator agreement..  
When a dose reduction is required, no dose reescalation will be  permitted for the duration of study 
treatment (with exception for hematologic toxicity on Day 15 wh en re-escalation with G-CSF support 
is permitted following a dose reduction on Day 8 of the same cy cle).

at 4 mg BID or TID for 3-4 days at the Investigator’s discretio n. Institutional guidelines and Investigator’s 
recommendations should be followed for breakthrough antiemetic management. BBI-608 dosing modification as 
outlined in Section 7.4 may be appropriate depending on the jud gment of the Investigator.
2Grade 2 or 3 cutaneous toxicity on Day 1 of any cycle requires reduction of both nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine to the 
next lower Dose Level. If Grade 2-3 cutaneous toxicity recurs d espite dose reduction, treatment should be discontinued. 
3For Grade > 3 neuropathy, nab-paclitaxel treatment should be he ld and gemcitabine may be continued. Nab-paclitaxel 
treatment may be resumed at next lower level if neuropathy impr oves to < Grade 1. Discontinuation of treatment with 
nab-paclitaxel is recommended in cases of peripheral neuropathy resulting in > 21 day delay in nab-paclitaxel 
administration unless not deemed appropriate in the judgment of  the Investigator.
4Except for mild or asymptomatic pulmonary embolism treated with  low-molecular-weight heparin without interruption 
of therapy. Moderate to severe pulmonary embolism will require permanent discontinuation of treatment.
5For initial treatment of Grade 3-4 diarrhea/mucositis BBI-608 do sing modification may be initiated as per Section 7.4 
prior to modification of backbone chemotherapy dosing.
When laboratory parameters or adverse events indicate that either  or both nab-paclitaxel and/or

7.6 BLINDING/UNBLINDING
This is an open label study. The primary endpoint of this study  is overall survival, the assessment of 
which is unlikely to be impacted by the open-label nature of th e study. 
However, to comply with ICH E6 (R2) Guideline for Good Clinical  Practice (2016) recommending 
the blinded review of planned analyses [http://www.ich.org/fileadmin/Public_Web_Site/ICH_Products/Guid elines/Efficacy/E6/E6_R2__Ste
p_4_2016_1109.pdf ], and to minimize the risk of any potential bias in the interim and final analyses, 
a blinding plan was implemented by the Sponsor and by the CRO t o maximize the integrity of the 
study. The Sponsor  blinding plan outlines the internal communic ation processes, data access levels, 
and firewalls that will be utilized to achieve study blinding i nternally. 
7.7 PATIENT MONITORING
For the duration that patients are on study therapy, adverse ev ent monitoring will be done continuously. 
Patients will be evaluated for adverse events at each visit, an d are to be instructed to call their physician 
to report any adverse events between visits.
7.8 CONCOMITANT MEDICATIONS/PROCEDURES
7.8.1 Permitted TreatmentsAll information regarding concomitant treatments (medications o r procedures) must be recorded on 
the patient’s CRF (including the name of the medication or proc edure and duration of treatment).  
Palliative and supportive care is permitted for disease-related  symptoms for all patients. 
All palliative and supportive care measures may be administered  to patients in any study arm at the 
Investigator’s discretion. Incident palliative radiotherapy is permitted in any study arm while on study, 
but requirement of radiation to the target lesion(s) will quali fy the patient as having disease 
progression. 
Overall, CYP isoenzymes have an insignificant role in the biotr ansformation of BBI-608. The CYP 
P450 isoform 1A2 is the predominant isoform involved in the dru g’s metabolism. Although the 
following drugs are permitted while on study treatment, all rea sonable measures should be done to 
avoid use of drugs that are strong inhibitors of CYP1A2 unless there is medical necessity for their use.

Investigators may refer to the Investigator Brochure for additi onal information. 
Patients who require use of concomitant medications metabolized  by the CYP1A2, 2D6, 2C19, 3A4 
and 2C9 enzymes should be monitored, as per drug product label,  as use of BBI-608 can inhibit the 
abovementioned CYP enzymes leading to increased drug concentrat ions of the enzyme metabolites.
In addition, nab-paclitaxel is metabolized by CYP2C8 and CYP3A4 ; caution should be exercised when 
administering with drugs which a re CYP2C8 or CYP3A4 inducers or  inhibitors, e.g. amiodarone, 
cyclosporine, grapefruit juice, simvastatin etc.

Following disease progression based on RECIST 1.1 criteria, pat ients will permanently discontinue 
treatment with nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine, but may continue BBI-608 treatment with the 
Sponsor’s approval for as long as in the opinion of the investi gator and patient that it is believed to be 
in the patient’s best interest and with the patient’s informed consent, until February 28th, 2020 or the 
following requirements are met: 
1. Patient does not demonstrate a clinically apparent decline in  performance status.
2. Patient does not demonstrate clinically significant worsening  of disease related symptoms.

CONFIDENTIAL 39 CONFIDENTIAL9.0 CRITERIA FOR MEASUREMENT OF STUDY ENDPOINTS
9.1 DEFINITIONS
9.1.1 Evaluable for Adverse EventsAll patients who have received at least one dose of study drug ( BBI-608 or Nab-Paclitaxel or 
Gemcitabine) will be evaluable for adverse events from the time  of their first dose.
9.1.2 Evaluable for OSAll randomized patients will be included in the analysis of OS,  which is defined as the time interval 
between the date of randomization and the date of death from an y cause. Patients who are still alive at 
the time of the final analysis , or who have become lost to foll ow-up will be censored at their last date 
known to be alive.  
9.1.3 Evaluable for PFSAll randomized patients will be included in the analysis of PFS , which is defined as the time interval 
between the date of randomization and the date of objective dis ease progression or death, whichever 
comes first. If neither event has been observed, then the patie nt will be censored at the date of the last 
tumor assessment.
Disease progression is defined as objective progression per REC IST 1.1 (Eisenhauer, 2009) .I t  i s  
required to perform, whenever possible, a radiological confirma tion of the clinical suspicion of tumor 
progression. In the situation where there is clinical suspicion  of progression but objective progression 
cannot be determined per RECIST 1.1, disease is defined as clin ical deterioration without objective 
evidence of progression. 
The date of disease progression is defined as the date when the  criteria for objective progression are 
first met. 
9.1.4 Evaluable for DCR
Patients who have measurable disease by RECIST 1.1 at randomiza tion will be included in the analysis 
of DCR which is defined as a composite of Stable Disease, Parti al Response and Complete Response 
as classified according to the definitions set out below (Eisenhauer, 2009) . For patients who 
discontinue protocol therapy prior to their first objective ass essment of response, it is imperative that 
an objective response assessment be undertaken as close to the protocol specified schedule as possible.
9.1.5 Evaluable for ORR
Patients with measurable disease by RECIST 1.1 at randomization  will be included in the analysis of 
ORR which is defined as a composite of Partial Response and Com plete Response as classified 
according to the definitions set out below (Eisenhauer, 2009) . For patients who discontinue protocol 
therapy prior to their first objective assessment of response, it is imperative that an objective response 
assessment be undertaken as close to the protocol specified sch edule as possible.
9.1.6 Evaluable for QoL Assessment

Protocol Date: 2019-JUL-31
Amendment #5 
  
CONFIDENTIAL 40 CONFIDENTIALAll patients who have completed the baseline quality of life qu estionnaire and at least one other QoL 
questionnaire are evaluable.
9.2 RESPONSE AND EVALUATION ENDPOINTS
Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the revised international criteria (1.1) 
proposed by the RECIST committee. 
9.2.1 Measurable Disease
Measurable tumor lesions are defined as those that can be accurately measured in at leas t one 
dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as > 20 mm with che st x-ray and as > 10 mm with CT 
scan, or clinical examination. Bone lesions are considered meas urable only if assessed by CT scan and 
have an identifiable soft tissue component that meets these req uirements (soft tissue component > 10 
m m  b y  C T  s c a n ) .  Malignant lymph nodes must be > 15mm in the short axis to be considered 
measurable; only the short axis will be measured and followed. All tumor measurements must be 
recorded in millimeters (or decimal fractions of centimeters). Previously irradiated lesions are not 
considered measurable unless progression has been documented in  the lesion. 
9.2.2 Non-Measurable Disease
All other lesions (or sites of disease), including small lesion s are considered non-measurable disease. 
Bone lesions without a measurable soft tissue component, leptom eningeal disease, ascites, 
pleural/pericardial effusions, lymphangitis cutis/pulmonis, inf lammatory breast disease, lymphangitic 
involvement of lung or skin and abdominal masses followed by cl inical examination are all non-
measurable. Lesions in previously irradiated areas are non-meas urable, unless progression has been 
demonstrated. 
9.2.3 Target Lesions
When more than one measurable tumor lesion is present at baseli ne all lesions up to a maximum of 5 
lesions total (and a maximum of 2 lesions per organ ) representative of all involved organs should be 
identified as target lesions and will be recorded and measured at baseline. Target lesions should be 
selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest d iameter), be representative of all involved 
organs, but in addition should be those that lend themselves to  reproducible repeated measurements .
Note that pathological nodes must meet the criterion of a short  axis of > 15 mm by CT scan and only 
the short axis of these nodes will contribute to the baseline sum. All ot her pathological nodes (those 
with short axis > 10 mm but < 15 mm) should be considered non-t arget lesions. Nodes that have a 
short axis < 10 mm are considered non-pathological and should n ot be recorded or followed (see 
10.2.4). At baseline, the sum of the target lesions (longest dia meter of tumor lesions plus short axis of 
lymph nodes: overall maximum of 5) is to be recorded. 
After baseline, a value should be provided on the CRF for all i dentified target lesions for each 
assessment, even if very small. If extremely small and faint le sions cannot be accurately measured but 
are deemed to be present, a default value of 5 mm may be used. If lesions are too small to measure and 
indeed are believed to be absent , a default value of 0 mm may b e used.
9.2.4 Non-Target Lesions
CanStem111P
Protocol Date: 2019-JUL-31
Amendment #5 
  
CONFIDENTIAL 41 CONFIDENTIALAll non-measurable lesions (or sites of disease) plus any measu rable lesions over and above those 
listed as target lesions are considered  non-target lesions . Measurements are not required but these 
lesions should be noted at baseline and should be followed as “ present” or “absent”.
9.2.5 Response A l l  p a t i e n t s  w i l l  h a v e  t h e i r  B E S T  R E S P O N S E  f r o m  t h e  s t a r t  o f  s t udy treatment until the end of 
treatment classified as outlined below: 
Complete Response (CR): disappearance of target and non-target . Pathological lymph nodes must 
have short axis measures < 10 mm (Note: continue to record the measurement even if < 10 mm and 
considered CR). Residual lesions (other than nodes < 10 mm) tho ught to be non-malignant should be 
further investigated (by cytology specialized imaging or other techniques as appropriate for individual 
cases (Eisenhauer, 2009) ) before CR can be accepted. 
Partial Response (PR): at least a 30% decrease in the sum of me asures (longest diameter for tumor 
lesions and short axis measure for nodes) of target lesions, ta king as reference the baseline sum of 
diameters. Non-target lesions must be non-PD. 
Stable Disease (SD): neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify fo r PR, nor sufficient increase to qualify 
for PD taking as reference the smallest sum of diameters on stu dy.
Progressive Disease (PD): at lea st a 20% increase in the sum of  diameters of measured lesions taking 
as references the smallest sum of diameters recorded on study (i ncluding baseline) AND an absolute 
increase of > 5mm. Appearance of new lesions will also constitu te progressive disease (including 
lesions in previously unassessed areas). For patients with on-s tudy tumor assessments with 
questionable findings of new lesions, such as cases where it is  possible that the lesions were present at 
baseline imaging albeit less visible, the patient may continue treatment (if patient is clinically doing 
well) for an additional 4-8 weeks, until the next scan which wi ll either confirm presence of a new 
lesion finding or exclude it. In exceptional circumstances, une quivocal progression of non-target 
disease may be accepted as evidence of disease progression, whe re the overall tumor burden has 
increased sufficiently to merit discontinuation of treatment or  where the tumor burden appears to have 
increased by at least 73% in volume. Modest increases in the si ze of one or more non-target lesions 
are NOT considered unequivocal progression. If the evidence of PD is equivocal (target or non-target), 
treatment may continue until the next assessment, but if confir med, the earlier date must be used.

progression having been observed at that time should be reporte d as “symptomatic deterioration”. This is NOT 
objective PD. Every effort should be made to document the objec tive progression even after discontinuation of 
treatment.
9.3 RESPONSE DURATION
Response duration will be measured from the time measurement cr iteria for CR/PR (whichever is first 
recorded) are first met until the first date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively 
documented, taking as reference the smallest measurements recor ded on study (including baseline).
9.4 STABLE DISEASE DURATION
Stable disease duration will be measured from the time of rando mization until the criteria for 
progression are met, taking as reference the smallest sum on st udy (including baseline).
9.5 METHODS OF MEASUREMENT
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each identified 
and reported lesion at baseline and during follow-up. Assessmen ts should be identified on a calendar 
schedule and should not be affected by delays in therapy. While  on study, all lesions recorded at 
baseline should have their actual measurements recorded at each  subsequent evaluation, even when 
very small (e.g. 2 mm). If it is the opinion of the radiologist  that the lesion has likely disappeared, the 
measurement should be recorded as 0 mm. If the lesion is believ ed to be present and is faintly seen but 
too small to measure, a default value of 5 mm should be assigne d. For lesions which fragment/split 
add together the longest diameters of the fragmented portions; for lesions which coalesce, measure the 
maximal longest diameter for the “merged lesion”.
Additionally, for optimal tumor assessment scanning options are  listed below in the decreasing order 
of preference:

9.5.1 Clinical Lesions 
Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they a re superficial and > 10 mm as assessed 
using callipers (e.g. skin nodules). For the case of skin lesio ns, documentation by colour photography 
including a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion is recomme nded. If feasible, imaging is preferred.
9.5.2 Chest X-ray
Chest CT is preferred over chest X-ray, particularly when progr ession is an important endpoint, since 
CT is more sensitive than X-ray, particularly in identifying ne w lesions. However, lesions > 20 mm 
on chest X-ray may be considered measurable if they are clearly defined and surrounded by aerated 
lung.  
9.5.3 CT/MRI
CT is the best currently available and reproducible method to m easure lesions selected for response 
assessment. This guideline has defined measurability of lesions  on CT scan based on the assumption
that CT slice thickness is 5 mm or less. When CT scans have sli ce thickness greater than 5 mm, the 
minimum size for a measurable lesion should be twice the slice thickness. MRI is also acceptable in 
certain situations (e.g. for body scans). Other specialized ima ging or other techniques may also be 
appropriate for individual case (Eisenhauer, 2009) . For example, while PET scans are not considered 
adequate to measure lesions, PET-CT scans may be used providing  that the measures are obtained 
from the CT scan and the CT scan is of identical diagnostic qual ity to a diagnostic CT (with IV and 
oral contrast). 
9.5.4 Ultrasound Ultrasound is not useful in assessment of lesion size and shoul d not be used as a method of 
measurement. If new lesions are identified by ultrasound in the  course of the study, confirmation by 
CT is advised.
9.5.5 Endoscopy/Laparoscopy 
The utilization of these techniques for objective tumor evaluat ion is not advised. However, they can 
be useful to confirm complete pathological response when biopsi es are obtained or to determine 
relapse in trials where recurrence following complete response or surgical resection is an endpoint. 
9.5.6 HistologyThese techniques can be used to differentiate between PR and CR  in rare cases (for example, residual 
lesions in tumor types such as germ cell tumors, where known re sidual benign tumors can remain).
The cytological confirmation of the neoplastic origin of any ef fusion that appears or worsens during 
treatment when the measurable tumor has met criteria for respon se or stable disease is mandatory to 
differentiate between response or stable disease (an effusion m ay be a side effect of the treatment) and 
progressive disease.

The descriptions and grading scales found in the NCI Common Ter minology Criteria for Adverse 
Events (CTCAE) will be utilized for Adverse Event (AE) and Serio us Adverse Event (SAE) reporting 
(version can be found in Appendix IV).  
All appropriate treatment areas should have access to a copy of  the CTCAE. A copy of the CTCAE 
can be downloaded from the CTEP web site: (http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applicati ons/ctc.htm ).
All serious adverse events (SAE) defined as per ICH guidelines (see below) and other adverse events 
must be recorded on case report forms. All SAEs must be reporte d to the Sponsor within 24 hours 
(Section 10.2).    
10.1 DEFINITION OF A PROTOCOL REP ORTABLE SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT
All serious adverse events must be reported in an expedited manner (see Sec tion 10.2 for reporting 
instructions). These include events occurring from the time the  patient signs informed consent until 30 
days after last protocol treatment administration. Determinatio n of relationship between the event and 
study drug should be made by a qualified physician Investigator .  
A serious adverse event (SAE) is any adverse event that at any dose:
results in death;
is life-threatening;
requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization (excluding 
hospital admissions for study drug administration); 
results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity;
is a congenital anomaly/birth defect.
is an important medical event. 
  
Note: clinically significant test results should be recorded on  the AE CRF using the appropriate 
CTCAE description and grading scale. 
10.2 SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING INSTRUCTIONS
SAE reporting will commence following the signature of the info rmed consent and continue for 30
days following the last dose of BBI-608 and/or Nab-Paclitaxel an d/or Gemcitabine. Any SAE 
occurring following patient signature of informed consent and p rior to patient randomization must be 
submitted to the Sponsor/Sponsor Designee for review and confir mation of randomization eligibility
prior to patient randomization and/or study drug administration , even if the patient completely 
recovered from the SAE. Additionally, any SAE occurring at any time following administration of the 
final dose of protocol treatment  that is suspected to be relate d to study treatment must be reported.
All SAEs must be reported using the SAE Report Form for this tr ial.

10.3 PROCEDURES IN CASE OF AN OVERDOSE
Use of BBI-608 in doses in excess of that specified in the prot ocol should be reported in the following 
manner: 
If an adverse event(s) is associated with (“results from”) the overdose of BBI-608, the overdose and 
adverse event are reported on the SAE Report Form, even if no o ther criteria for serious are met. The 
SAE Report Form should be submitted within 24 hours. The overdo se should also be recorded on the 
relevant AE form in the eCRF using the term “accidental or inte ntional overdose with adverse effect.”
If the overdose of BBI -608 is not associated with an adverse ev ent, the overdose is reported as a non-
serious AE, on the relevant AE form in the eCRF within 24 hours , using the event term “accidental or 
intentional overdose without adverse effect.” The Clinical Rese arch Associate responsible for the 
investigational center should also be notified of the event wit hin 24 hours. 
Investigators/site personnel are to consult the local, approved  product labels for nab-paclitaxel with 
gemcitabine treatment regimen for guidance on the definition of a n overdose of these agents as well 
as for guidance on reporting of any AE or SAE associated with o verdose of either nab-paclitaxel or 
gemcitabine. Overdose of either nab-paclitaxel  or gemcitabine should also be  reported to the Sponsor 
in accordance with overdose reporting guidelines above. 
10.4 OTHER PROTOCOL REPORTABLE EVENTS – PREGNANCY/EXPOSURE REPORT ING
WOCBP may be enrolled in this c linical trial. WOCBP are defined  as women who have had a 
menstrual period during the last year and have not had a hyster ectomy. Precautions are required to be 
taken to prevent pregnancy during the clinical trial when the r esearch population includes WOCBP. 
This includes pregnancy testing, use of effective methods of bi rth control, and pregnancy as an 
exclusion factor. The trial sample informed consent form includ es the potential for unidentified risks 
to the embryo/fetus. It also includes general information on pregnancy prevention an d the required 
minimum period during which birth control must be utilized.  
10.4.1 Pregnancy Prevention
WOCBP and males who are enrolled in the trial must be informed of the requirement to use 
contraception as outlined in the eligibility criteria (Sections  4.1 and 4.2). Investigators are advised to 
inform the female partners of male participants when appropriat e and compliant with local policy.  
A highly effective method of birth control is defined as those which result in a failure rate of <1% per 
year when used consistently and correctly. 
10.4.2 Pregnancy Occurring in WOCBP Exposed to Study Agent Any female participant who becomes pregnant during the course o f the trial should be instructed to

The Investigator should provide counselling and discuss the ris ks and possible side effects to the 
embryo/fetus from BBI-608 and nab-paclitaxel with gemcitabine. Monitoring should continue until 
conclusion of the pregnancy. The same should occur for female p artners of a male participant, or any 
female exposed to BBI-608 when appropriate and compliant with l ocal policy. 
10.4.3 Pregnancy/Exposure Reporting The Investigator is required to report to the sponsor any pregn ancy where the embryo/fetus could have 
been exposed to BBI-608. This means pregnancies occurring in fe male participants, female partners 
of male participants, or females exposed through direct contact  with the agent during their pregnancy 
(for example, environmental exposure involving direct contact w ith the agent). Pregnancies occurring 
until 30 days in female patients and until 90 days in partners o f male patients, after the completion of 
BBI-608 must also be reported. Pregnancies occurring until 180 da ys in female patients and until 180 
days in partners of male patients, after the completion of nab- paclitaxel and/or gemcitabine must also 
be reported. 
The Investigator is required to inform the Sponsor within 24 ho urs of learning of the pregnancy using 
the SAE reporting form appropriate for the trial as indicated a bove. In the Adverse Event column 
please enter the following: “pregnancy, puerperium and perinata l conditions – other, specify” (fetal

10.5 RESPONSIBILITY FOR REPORTING SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS TO REGU LATORY 
AGENCIES
Boston Biomedical, or the delegated CRO, will provide expedited reports of SAEs to FDA and other 
applicable regulatory authorities, for those events which meet regulatory requirements for expedited 
reporting, i.e. events which are BOTH serious AND unexpected, AND which are related to treatment
BBI-608 (suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction [SUSAR]) :
yUnexpected adverse events are those which are not consistent in either nat ure or severity with the 
reference safety information contained in the Investigator’s Br ochure  
yAdverse events considered related to protocol treatment are those events which have a 
reasonable possibility of being related to BBI-608. 
Boston Biomedical will determine w hich SAEs meet the criteria f or regulatory reporting.

ALL STUDY TREATMENT
11.1 CRITERIA FOR DISCONTINUING PROTOCOL TREATMENT
Patients should stop protocol treatment in the following instan ces:
yProgressive Disease (see section 9.2.5) 
yPregnancy
yIntercurrent illness which would, in the judgement of the Inves tigator, affect assessments of 
clinical status to a significant degree, and require discontinu ation of protocol therapy 
yUnacceptable toxicity
yRequest by the patient
If a patient discontinues protocol treatment for objective prog ression on nab-paclitaxel and 
gemcitabine with BBI-608 (Arm 1), the patient together with thei r investigator, may elect to continue 
treatment with BBI-608 in monotherapy with the Sponsor’s approv al, provided no discontinuation 
criterion involving BBI-608-related adverse events is met, it i s believed to be in the patient’s best 
interest by the investigator and patient, and with the patient’ s informed consent.
If a patient permanently discontinues protocol treatment for a reason other than objective progression, 
every effort should be made to obtain tumor evaluations on the same schedule until progression is 
observed. 
Efforts should be made to maintain the investigations schedule and continue follow-up, even if patients 
discontinue protocol treatment prematurely and/or no longer att end the participating institution.  
11.2 DURATION OF PROTOCOL TREATMENT 
Patients may continue to receive  protocol treatment as long as they have not experienced any adverse 
events requiring permanent discontinuation of study medication and have not demonstrated disease 
progression based on RECIST criteria, if it is believed to be in  t h e  p a t i e n t ’ s  b e s t  i n t e r e s t  o r u n t i l

Protocol-Mandated Correlative Studies: 
The submission of a representative diagnostic tumor tissue and of a blood sample for correlative studies 
defined in Section 13.6 (Correlative Studies) is mandatory for p articipation in this trial (although 
submission of the tissue does not have to occur prior to random ization). Where local center regulations 
prohibit submission of blocks of tumor tissue, two 2 mm cores of  tumor from the block and 5-20
unstained slides of representative tumor tissue are requested. W here 2 mm cores of tumor from the 
block are unavailable, 5-20 unstained slides of representative tumor tissue are requested. Where no 
previously resected or biopsied tumor tissue exists, on the app roval of the Sponsor/designated CRO, 
the patient may still be considered eligible for the study.
After patient consent, blood sample and paraffin tumor blocks wil l be the preferred tissue material to 
collect. If tumor blocks are unavailable, then two 2 mm cores o f tumor from the block and 5-20 
specimen slides are preferred. If two 2 mm cores of tumor from the block are unavailable, 5-20 
specimen slides will be acceptable. If, at any time, the submit ting hospital requires the block to be 
returned for medical or legal concerns, it will be returned by courier on request. 
Samples will be used for research purposes only and will not be  sold. Patients will not be identified by 
name. The only identification of tissue will be by a patient st udy number assigned at the time of 
randomization to the trial. Material issued to researchers will  be anonymous and only identified by a

CONFIDENTIAL 52 CONFIDENTIAL13.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS
Detailed methodology for summary and statistical analyses of th e data collected in this study will be 
documented in a statistical analysis plan (SAP), which will be maintained by the sponsor.  The SAP 
may modify the plans outlined in the protocol; however, any maj or modifications of the primary 
endpoint definition and/or its analysis will also be reflected in a protocol amendment. 
13.1 OBJECTIVES AND DESIGN 
The primary objective of this study is to assess the effect of orally administered BBI-608 plus weekly 
nab-paclitaxel with gemcitabine (Arm 1), in comparison to weekly  nab-paclitaxel with gemcitabine
(Arm 2) on the Overall Survival (OS) in patients with metastati c PDAC. 
Key secondary objectives for this study include comparisons of PFS in the general population, DCR
in the general population and ORR in the general population. Ot her secondary objectives include
Adverse Events and Quality of Life Assessment in the general po pulation between the two treatment 
arms.
This is a multi-center, prospective, open-label, randomized Pha se III trial. Patients will be randomized 
to receive either BBI-608 plus weekly nab-paclitaxel with gemci tabine, or weekly nab-paclitaxel with 
gemcitabine in a 1:1 ratio and will be stratified by geographica l region (North America/Western 
Europe/Australia vs. Japan/Korea vs. Rest of the World), ECOG pe rformance status (ECOG 0 versus 
ECOG 1), and presence of liver metastases (yes versus no).
13.2 STUDY ENDPOINTS AND ANALYSIS
13.2.1 Primary Endpoint 
OS in the General Study Population 
Unless otherwise specified, all efficacy analyses will be based  on the Primary Analysis Set, which 
includes all randomized patients. Patients will be analyzed as randomized. As a sensitivity analysis, 
the Per Protocol population will also be analyzed for key effic acy endpoints. 
Overall Survival in the general study population, the primary en dpoint of this study, is defined as the 
time from randomization to death from any cause. Patients who a re alive at the time of the final analysis 
or who have become lost to follow-up will be censored at their last date known to be alive. Patients 
will be analyzed in the arm to which they are randomized regard less of the treatment they received 
(intent-to-treat analysis). The survival experience of patients  in both treatment groups will be 
summarized by the Kaplan-Meier method and compared primarily by a stratified log-rank test 
adjusting for stratification variables at randomization.  
Sensitivity analyses based on stratified Cox proportional hazar ds model will also be performed. These 
sensitivity analyses are not included in the multiplicity adjus tment for secondary outcomes detailed 
below and, as such, do not control for type I error. Geographica l region (North America/Western 
Europe/Australia vs. Japan/Korea vs. Rest of the World), ECOG p erformance status (ECOG 0 versus
ECOG 1), and presence of liver metastases (yes versus  no) will be the stratification factors to define

Subgroup analysis and the corresponding forest plot analysis may be performed using the stratification 
factors mentioned above as well as the following factors: 
xPrimary tumor location (head versus other)
xLevel of CA19-9 (normal versus  <59 x ULN versus  >59 x ULN)
xAge (< 65 versus  > 65)
xSex (male versus female)
xNumber of metastatic sites at baseline (1 versus  > 2) 
xRace (white, black, Asian, other)
xCountry (Canada, USA, Europe, others) 
13.2.2 Key Secondary Endpoints 
The following secondary outcomes will be assessed. 
PFS in the General Study Population 
PFS in the general study population is defined as the time from randomization to the first objective 
documentation of disease progression or death due to any cause. If a patient has not progressed or died 
at the time of final analysis, PFS will be censored on the date of the last tumor assessment. This 
includes patients who are lost to follow-up or have withdrawn c onsent.  
DCR in the General Study Population
DCR is defined as the proportion of patients with a documented complete response, partial response, 
and stable disease (CR + PR + SD) based on RECIST 1.1. The prim ary estimate of DCR will be based 
on patients with measurable disease by RECIST 1.1 at randomizat ion.  
ORR in the General Study Population
ORR is defined as the proportion of patients with a documented complete response and partial response 
(CR + PR) based on RECIST 1.1. The primary estimate for ORR wil l be based on patients with 
measurable disease by RECIST 1.1 at randomization. 
13.2.3 Other Secondary Endpoints 
Safety Analysis
All patients who have received at least one dose of study drug w ill be included in the safety analysis. 
The incidence of adverse events will be summarized by type of a dverse event and severity using the 
NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 4.0.  A Fisher’s exact test may be used 
to compare adverse events between the two arms.
QoL Analysis 
The QoL of patients will be assessed using EORTC QLQ-30 while t he patient remains on BBI-608 as 
per Section 8.1. The EORTC QLQ- 30 is a self-administered cancer  specific questionnaire with multi-
dimensional scales. It consists of both multi-item scales and s ingle item measures, including five 
functional domains, a global quality of life domain, three symp tom domains, and six single items. 
Scoring of the EORTC QLQ-30 data will be completed following th e procedures recommended by the 
CanStem111P
Protocol Date: 2019-JUL-31
Amendment #5 
  
CONFIDENTIAL 54 CONFIDENTIALEORTC Study Group on Quality of Life. For each domain or single  item measure a linear 
transformation will be applied to standardize the raw score to r ange between 0 and 100. The quality of 
life data will be analyzed to look for statistically and clinic ally significant differences between the 
BBI-608 plus nab-paclitaxel with gemcitabine versus  nab-paclitaxel with gemcitabine groups. 
Questionnaire compliance rates will be ascertained for each gro up at each measurement time point. 
Mean baseline scores for each subscale and summary scores will be calculated.
The endpoints in QoL analysis are the mean EORTC QLQ-C30 QoL ch ange scores from baseline at 
time 2 (~8 weeks from Cycle 1 Day 1) and time 4 (~16 weeks from C ycle 1 Day 1) for the physical 
function and global health status/quality of life subscale scor es. Wilcoxon tests will be used to compare 
the difference at each of these two time points between two tre atment arms for each of these two 
subscales. The proportion of patients in either arm with at lea st a minimum of 10 unit(s) deterioration 
in change scores at both 8 and 16 weeks from Cycle 1 Day 1 will  be compared by means of Fisher’s 
exact test.
13.2.4 Exploratory Endpoints OS in the Predefined Biomarker-positive Population
OS in the general predefined biomarker-positive population is d efined as the time from randomization 
to death due to any cause. If a patient has not died at the tim e of final analysis, OS will be censored on 
the date of the last follow up assessment. This includes patien ts who are lost to follow-up or have 
withdrawn consent.  
PFS in the Predefined Biomarker-positive Population
PFS in the predefined biomarker-positive population is defined as the time from randomization to the 
first objective documentation of disease progression or death d ue to any cause. If a patient has not 
progressed or died at the time of final analysis, PFS will be c ensored on the date of the last tumor 
assessment. This includes patients who are lost to follow-up or  have withdrawn consent.  
ORR and DCR in the Predefined Biomarker-positive Population
ORR in the predefined biomarker-positive population is defined as the proportion of patients with a 
documented complete response and partial response (CR + PR) bas ed on RECIST 1.1. The primary 
estimate for ORR will be based on patients with measurable dise ase by RECIST 1.1 at randomization. 
DCR in the predefined biomarker-positive population is defined as the proportion of patients with a 
documented complete response, partial response, and stable dise ase (CR + PR + SD) based on RECIST 
1.1. The primary estimate of DCR will be based on patients with  measurable disease by RECIST 1.1 
at randomization.  
13.3 SAMPLE SIZE AND DURATION OF STUDY
The primary study endpoint for all patients on the study is OS.   
The study is designed to have a power of 90% and a one-sided al pha of 2.5% to detect a 20% reduction 
in the continuous risk of death (HR 0.80, which corresponds to an increase of median survival from 
8.5 to 10.63 months) in the Intention to Treat (ITT) general st udy population. The 864thevent will 
trigger the final analysis. It is estimated that 864 events wil l be required to detect a 20% reduction in 
the risk of death which woul d be observed by randomizing 1132 p atients over 24 months with patient 
follow up for an additional 12 months, for total study duration of 36 months. It is anticipated that up 
to 5% dropout rate will occur for the entire study.
CanStem111P
Protocol Date: 2019-JUL-31
Amendment #5 
  
CONFIDENTIAL 55 CONFIDENTIALThe overall power of the study will be approximately 90% after the multiplicity control procedure is 
considered.
When the required number of events for the primary endpoint has  been reached, all randomized 
patients still alive will continue study follow up through to t heir deaths.  
13.4 SAFETY MONITORING
Adverse events will be monitored on an on-going basis by centra l review. 
13.5 INTERIM ANALYSIS
Prior to this amendment, there was one interim analysis presente d to the independent DSMB. 
Additionally, DSMB reviewed safety data during conduct of the st udy. The role and responsibility of 
the DSMB are defined in a separate Charter.
The interim analysis involved a stratified log-rank test. Nomina l p-values were based on the Lan-
DeMets error spending function using an O’Brien-Fleming stoppin g boundary in order to preserve the 
overall one-sided alpha level of 0.025. 
The interim analysis was performed when approximately 432 deaths  (50% of the required events) were
observed.  The interim analysis was for futility only, with the f utility boundary set at HR > 1. Safety 
data and primary analysis based on approximately 432 events were  presented to the DSMB on June 
24th, 2019. The DSMB reviewed the results on July 1st, 2019. Based on the recommendation of the 
DSMB, the Sponsor informed investigators on July 2nd, 2019 that the study would be discontinued due 
to futility. For patients enrolled to Arm 1, the Sponsor advise d that patients stop treatment with BBI-
608 but given that no safety concerns were identified by the DS MB, in cases in which a patient appears 
to be deriving benefit from BBI-608 in the opinion of the inves tigator and with the patient’s informed 
consent, continuation of protocol therapy was permitted. Patient s enrolled to Arm 2 were given the 
option to continue receiving standard of care therapy within th e study.  
Patients may continue to receive protocol therapy until a disconti nuation criterion is met, if believed 
to be i n th e pat ien t’ s bes t int ere st by  the inv est ig ator  and pat ient, and with the patient’s informed 
consent, or until February 28th, 2020, whichever occurs first. 
At study completion, analysis will be conducted for primary end point of OS as outlined in Section 13. 
Additionally, all secondary and exploratory analyses will be pe rformed as outlined in the protocol.  
13.6 CORRELATIVE STUDIES
The correlative science component of the CanStem111P trial will  include tumor and blood based 
assays to identify biomarkers of benefit from BBI-608 therapy, as well as biomarkers of BBI-608 
resistance. The purpose of these studies is to explore the poss ible relationship between biomarkers and 
disease response. The research aims to validate molecular marker s such as genes (DNA) and gene 
products (mRNA or proteins), with m easurements of their sequenc e, post translation modifications or 
CanStem111P
Protocol Date: 2019-JUL-31
Amendment #5 
  
CONFIDENTIAL 56 CONFIDENTIALdegree of expression, that can guide the use of appropriate thera peutic treatment regimens. The 
ultimate goal of identifying molecular markers is to improve su bject responses and other measures of 
clinical benefit by matching an individual subject’s tumor diag nostic profile with an anticancer agent 
that has demonstrated a therapeutic advantage in subjects with a similar diagnostic profile. If such a 
marker can be identified, the samples and results may also aid i n  t h e  d e v e l o p m e n t  o f  d i a g n o s t i c  
devices.
Using data from this and other trials, the relationship between  a number of molecular markers 
DVVRFLDWHGZLWKWKH67$7ȕ -catenin and other related pathways, and the clinical outcomes with BBI-
608 therapy may be explored. Multiple molecular markers in a para ffin-embedded tumor tissue sample 
can be determined by analyzing R NA and protein in the tissue sa mple. 
In addition to analysis of potential biomarkers of benefit from  BBI-608 therapy, an analysis of markers 
of resistance to BBI-608 will be conducted using blood samples drawn at baseline as well at 4 weeks 
post initiation of therapy. This analysis may involve SNPs, CYP S, and metabolomics.
Paraffin-embedded tumor specimens, or cores (two 2 mm cores of tumor from the block) and 5-20 
unstained slides obtained from paraffin embedded specimens will  be required. Where it is not possible 
to obtain two 2 mm cores of tumor from the block, 5-20 unstaine d slides of representative tumor tissue 
are also acceptable. Patients who do not have available archiva l tissue may enroll on the study with 
permission of the Sponsor/CRO.
Blood samples will be collected prior to dosing with BBI-608 an d then at week 4 while on BBI-608 in 
combination with nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine. 
The following analysis will be performed to investigate the rel ationship between endpoints and 
biomarker levels (e.g. phospho-STAT3, etc): 
For each biomarker, Cox Proportional Hazards model will be used  to model the relationship between 
Overall Survival, Progression-Free Survival and duration of res ponse with baseline value of the 
biomarker. The model will also include assigned treatment, inte raction between treatment and 
biomarker, and will be stratifie d by baseline ECOG performance status. 
For biomarkers with post-baseline measurements, similar analysi s will be done with change from 
baseline of a biomarker as a covariate, for both time points. An  additional model that includes 
prognostic factors may be investigated. 
The relationship between the endpoint and binary biomarkers (e. g. baseline phospho-STAT3 status, ß-
catenin, etc) will be also examined using the log-rank test, st ratified by treatment and baseline ECOG 
performance status. Subgroup analysis by the status of the bina ry biomarker may also be performed. 
The Kaplan-Meier method will be used to describe overall surviv al, progression-free survival and 
duration of response by the status of the biomarker (e.g. phosp ho-STAT3-high vs. phospho-STAT3-
low) and by treatment group. 
The relationships between the binary response variable (e.g. ob jective response, DCR) with baseline 
values of biomarkers as well as with their change from baseline  and at week 4 time point during 
treatment with nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine with or without BB I-608 will be investigated using 
logistic regression that includes assigned treatment and biomar ker value and treatment-by-biomarker 
interaction, stratified by baseline ECOG performance status. An  additional model that includes 
prognostic factors may be investigated. The relationship betwee n response and binary biomarkers (e.g. 
CanStem111P

CONFIDENTIAL 57 CONFIDENTIALbaseline phospho-STAT3 status or STAT3 status) will also be exa mined using the CMH test, stratified 
by treatment and baseline ECOG performance status. Subgroup ana lysis by the status of the binary 
biomarker may also be performed. 
Exploratory analyses, in addition to those described in this se ction, such as alternative modeling 
approaches and analyses of other biomarkers are expected and ma y be performed. All analyses 
described in this section are based on availability of data.
13.7 SPARSE PHARMACOKINETIC ANALYSIS
Exploratory analyses will be performed on the bioanalytic data obtained from sparse plasma sampling 
in order to characterize the population pharmacokinetics of BBI -608. Demographic and 
pathophysiologic factors that affect plasma concentration of BB I-608 and nab-paclitaxel with 
gemcitabine in this population of patients with metastatic PDAC will be examined. The exposure-
response relationship between clinical and safety endpoints and  BBI-608/nab-paclitaxel with 
gemcitabine exposure will also be examined.

16.2 INCLUSIVITY IN RESEARCH
Individuals must not be excluded from participation in clinical  trials on the basis of attributes such as 
culture, religion, race, national or ethnic origin, colour, men tal or physical disability (except 
incapacity), sexual orientation, sex/gender, occupation, ethnic ity, income, or criminal record, unless 
there is a valid reason (i.e. safety) for the exclusion.  
In accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and the Tri-Coun cil Policy Statement (TCPS), 
vulnerable persons or groups will not be automatically excluded  from a clinical trial (except for 
incompetent persons) if participation in the trial may benefit the patient or a group to which the person 
belongs.  
However, extra protections may be necessary for vulnerable pers ons or groups. It is the responsibility 
of the local Investigator and Institutional Review Board (IRB) to ensure that appropriate mechanisms 
are in place to protect vulnerable persons/groups. In accordanc e  w i t h  T C P S ,  r e s e a r c h e r s  a n d  I R B  
should provide special protections for those who are vulnerable  to abuse, exploitation or 
discrimination. As vulnerable populations may be susceptible to  coercion or undue influence, it is 
especially important that informed consent be obtained appropri ately.  
Centers are expected to ensure compliance with local IRB or ins titutional policy regarding 
participation of vulnerable persons/groups. It is the center’s responsibility to ensure compliance with 
all local SOPs. 
Persons who cannot give informed consent (i.e. mentally incompe tent persons, or those physically 
incapacitated such as comatose persons) are not to be recruited  to this study. It is the responsibility of 
the local Investigator to determine the subject’s competency, i n accordance with applicable local 
policies and in conjunction with the local IRB (if applicable).  
Subjects who were competent at the time of enrollment in the cl inical trial but become incompetent 
during their participation do not automatically have to be remo ved from the study. When re-consent 
of the patient is required, Investigators must follow applicabl e local policies when determining if it is 
acceptable for a substitute decision maker to be used. The Spons or will accept re-consent from a 
substitute decision maker. If this patient subsequently regains  capacity, the patient should be re-
consented as a condition of continuing participation.

CONFIDENTIAL 61 CONFIDENTIAL16.3 OBTAINING INFORMED CONSENT
Informed consent will be obtained for each participant/potentia l participant in this trial, in accordance 
with ICH-GCP section 4.8. The center is responsible for ensuring  that all local policies are followed.
Additionally, in accordance with GCP 4.8.2, the Sponsor may requ ire that participants/potential 
participants be informed of any new information may impact a pa rticipant’s/potential participant’s 
willingness to participate in the study. 
Based upon applicable guidelines and regulations (Declaration o f Helsinki, ICH-GCP), a participating 
Investigator (as defined on the participants list) is ultimatel y responsible, in terms of liability and 
compliance, for ensuring informed consent has been appropriatel y obtained. The Sponsor recognizes 
that in many centers other personnel (as designated on the part icipants list) also play an important role 
in this process. In accordance with GCP 4.8.5, it is acceptable  for the Principal Investigator to delegate 
the responsibility for conducting the consent discussion. 
The Sponsor requires that each participant sign a consent form prior to their enrolment in the study to 
document his/her willingness to take part. The Sponsor may also require, as indicated above, that 
participants/potential participants be informed of new informat ion if it becomes available during the 
course of the study. In conjunction with GCP 4.8.2, the communi cation of this information should be 
documented. 
The Sponsor allows the use of translators in obtaining informed consent. Provision of translators is the 
responsibility of the local center. Centers should follow applic able local policies when procuring or 
using a translator for the purpose of obtaining informed consen t to participate in a clinical trial. 
In accordance with ICH-GCP 4.8.9, if a subject is unable to rea d, then informed consent may be 
obtained by having the consent form read and explained to the s ubject. This process must be thoroughly 
documented. 
16.3.1 Obtaining Consent for Pregnancy/Exposure Reporting Information from and/or about the subject (i.e. the pregnant fe male, the newborn infant, male partner) 
should not be collected about or from them unless or until they  are a willing participant in the research. 
The rights and protections offered to participants in research apply and consent must be obtained prior 
to collecting any information about or from them. If the pregna nt female is not a participant in the 
main trial, consent shoul d be obtained via use of the exposure/ pregnancy follow-up consent form. 
In the case of information collected about a ne wborn, consent should be provided by the legal 
guardian. In cases where the legal guardian is the participant in the main trial, consent is obtained 
via the main consent. If the legal guardian is not the trial participant, consent should be obtained via 
the exposure/pregnancy follow-up consent.  
Participants will not be withdrawn from the main trial as a res ult of refusing or withdrawing permission 
to provide information related to the pregnancy /exposure . Similarly, male participants will not be 
withdrawn from the main study s hould their partner refuse/withd raw permission.

CONFIDENTIAL 62 CONFIDENTIAL16.4 DISCONTINUATION OF THE TRIAL
The study is planned for completion on February 28th, 2020, at which time the Sponsor will cease 
provision of protocol treatment.
If this trial is discontinued for any reason by the Sponsor pri or to February 28th, 2020, all centers will 
be notified in writing of the discontinuance and the reason(s) why. If the reason(s) for discontinuance 
involve any potential risks to the health of patients participa ting on the trial or other persons, the 
Sponsor will provide this information to centers as well.
If this trial is discontinued at any time by the center (prior t o closure of the trial by the Sponsor), it is 
the responsibility of the Principal Investigator to notify the Sponsor of the discontinuation and the 
reason(s) why.  
Whether the trial is discontinued by the Sponsor or locally by the center, it is the responsibility of the 
Principal Investigator to notify the local Institutional Review Board and all clinical trials subjects of 
the discontinuance and any potential risks to the subjects or o ther persons.
Following trial closure after demonstrating overall survival be nefit, and until the time that BBI-608 is 
commercially available, all patients randomized on the trial ma y have an opportunity to receive 
treatment with BBI-608; provided, that the Principal Investigat or has determined that such continued 
treatment would be in the best interest of the patient, and sub ject to approval by the applicable 
regulatory authorities. This will be done via a new, open label  extension study, or in another manner 
as determined by the Sponsor, requiring additional regulatory a pproval. 
16.5 RETENTION OF PATIENT RECORDS AND STUDY FILES
All essential documents must be m aintained in accordance with I CH-GCP. 
The Principal Investigator must ensure compliance with GCP Guid eline from every person involved 
in the conduct of the clinical trial at the site. 
Essential documents must be retained for 25 years following the  completion of the trial at the center
(25 years post final analysis, last data collected, or closure n otification to IRB, whichever is later), or 
until notified by the Sponsor that  documents no longer need to be retained. 
In accordance with GCP 4.9.7, upon request by the monitor, audi tor, IRB or regulatory authority, the 
Investigator/institution must make all required trial-related r ecords available for direct access. 
The Sponsor will inform the Investigator/Institution as to when  the essential documents no longer need 
to be retained. 
16.6 ON-SITE MONITORING/AUDITING
In addition to the routine review of case report forms and supp orting documents sent to the central 
office, site monitoring will be conducted at participating cent ers in the course of the study as part of 
the overall quality assurance programme. The monitors/auditors will require access to patient medical 
records to verify the data, as well as pharmacy, essential docu ment binders, standard operating

CONFIDENTIAL 74 CONFIDENTIALAPPENDIX V - QUALITY OF LIFE ASSESSMENT
Introduction 
The assumption that control of symptoms will automatically impr ove quality of life is probably true but hasn't 
yet been tested, especially in determining how certain symptoms  may or may not affect quality of life. Current 
literature reveals interesting things; two in particular are:
xadditional and useful information may be obtained from quality of life measurements
xa growing consensus that the goal of medical care today for mos t patients is the preservation of function 
and well-being in everyday life
We have reached the stage where the collection of information a bout psychological distress, social disruption, 
emotional trauma and painful side-effects is not only necessary  but a routine component in many protocols. 
Quality of life data can be used in a variety of ways:
xto try to achieve the best possible outcome for patients
xto evaluate the extent of change in the quality of life of an i ndividual or group across time
xto evaluate new treatments and technologies
xto support approval of new drug applications 
xto try to provide the best value for health care dollars 
xto compare costs and benefits of various financial and organiza tional aspects of health care services
In the future, approval of not only drugs but also new therapie s or methods of delivery will most likely be 
based on a combination of quality of life, survival, response, and adverse event data.
Instructions for Administrati on of a Quality of Life Questionna ire.  
The instructions below are intended as a guide for the administ ration of the Quality of Life questionnaire. 
1. Preamble
Quality of life data are collected for research purposes, and w ill usually not be used for the patient’s individual 
medical care. The assessment is in the form of a self-report qu estionnaire. Therefore, it must be completed by 
the patient only, without translation, coaching or suggestions as to the "correct" answer by relatives or health 
care personnel.
The usual scheduled times to obtain the questionnaires are as f ollows: 
xpre-randomization or pre-registration (baseline)
xduring treatment 
xduring follow-up 
The information provided by the patient in the completed questi onnaire is confidential and should not be 
discussed with or shown to anyone  who is NOT mentioned in the c onsent form signed by the patient. 
If a particular question has not been answered, please document  the reason(s) in the appropriate space on the 
CanStem111P
Protocol Date: 2019-JUL-31
Amendment #5 
  
CONFIDENTIAL 75 CONFIDENTIALquestionnaire. If the whole questionnaire has not been complete d, please document the reason(s) on the 
appropriate case report forms.
2. Pre-Treatment Assessment
It should be explained to the patient that the purpose of the q uestionnaire is to assess the impact of treatment 
on different areas of the patient's life, e.g.: psychological d istress, social disruption, side-effects, et cetera.
Study staff should collect the questionnaire as soon as it has b een completed, check to see that each question 
has been answered and gently remind the patient to answer any i nadvertently omitted questions. If a patient 
states that s/he prefers not to answer some questions and gives  a reason(s), the reason(s) should be noted on 
the questionnaire. If a specific reason is not given, this also  should be noted on the questionnaire. 
3. Assessments During Treatment
The quality of life questionnaire should be given to the patien t before being seen by the doctor, and prior to 
treatment on the day of treatment, as required by the schedule in the protocol. If the patient does not have a 
doctor visit scheduled, or if it was not possible for the patie nt to complete the questionnaire before being seen 
by the doctor, s/he should still complete the questionnaire pri or to treatment.
4. Assessments During Follow-up 
The quality of life questionnaire should be given to the patien t before being seen by the doctor, for as long as 
the patient continues on Protocol therapy, as required by the s chedule at approximately: 
4, 8, 12, 16 and 24 weeks or until deterioration to ECOG PS 4 o r hospitalization for end of life care  
the first regularly scheduled 4 week assessment at which the pa tient has been off study therapy for a minimum 
of 28 days (+/- 3 days) if study therapy discontinuation occurred  prior to 24 weeks and until deterioration to 
ECOG PS 4 or hospitalization for end of life care 
A patient may, on occasion, be reluctant to complete the questi onnaire because they feel unwell. In that case, 
you may express sympathy that things are below par, but state t hat this is exactly the information we require 
if we are to understand more about how quality of life is affec ted. You may also remind them that it takes only 
a few minutes to complete.
It defeats the whole purpose of the assessment if it is delayed until the patient feels better!
5. What If . . .
The patient should complete the questionnaires at the clinic. T he exception is that the design of some trials 
may require the patient to take the questionnaire home with the m after leaving the clinic, and complete it on 
the specific day, because a return visit to the clinic is not s cheduled.
There may be circumstances when the patient does not complete t he questionnaire as required in the clinic. 
Three situations are described below. In these cases, it is ben eficial if quality of life data can still be collected.
A. The patient leaves the clinic before the questionnaire could be administered, or someone forgets to give the 
questionnaire to the patient.  
Contact the patient by phone informing him or her that the ques tionnaire was not completed. Ask the patient 
if s/he is willing to complete one: 
CanStem111P
Protocol Date: 2019-JUL-31
Amendment #5 
  
CONFIDENTIAL 76 CONFIDENTIALIf yes, mail a blank questionnaire to the patient, and make arra ngements for return of the questionnaire in a 
timely fashion. Record the date it was mailed and the date rece ived on the questionnaire.
If this is not feasible, then ask the patient if s/he is willing  to complete a questionnaire over the phone. If the 
patient agrees, read out the questions and range of possibiliti es, and record the answers. Make a note on the 
questionnaire that the questionnaire was completed over the pho ne. 
If no, note the reason why the questionnaire was not completed on the appropriate case report form.
B. The patient goes on an extended vacation for several months and won't attend the clinic for regular visit(s).Ensure that the patient has a supply of questionnaires, with in structions about when to complete them, and how 
to return them. If it is known beforehand, give the patient bla nk questionnaires at the last clinic visit; if the 
extended absence is not known in advance, mail the blank questi onnaires to the patient. Written instructions 
may help ensure that the patient stays on schedule as much as p ossible.  
C. The patient does not want to complete the questionnaire in clinic. Should the patient not wish to answer the questionnaire in the clinic but insists on taking it home, and failing 
to comply with the patient's wishes is likely to result in the questionnaire not being completed at all, then the 
patient may take the questionnaire home with instructions that i t is to be completed the same day. When the 
questionnaire is returned, the date on which the questionnaire was completed should be noted and a comment 
made on the questionnaire as to why  the patient took it away fr om the clinic before completion.

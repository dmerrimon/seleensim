Spinal Cord Stimulation as Treatment for Major Depressive Disorder  
 
Project Summary (Abstract):  
Major depressive disorder  (MDD)  is a recurrent and chronic mood disorder that affects 14% of the adult population during 
their lifetime. Current treatment options are partially effective and the neurobiology of MDD is largely  unknown. Recent 
evidence points to an important role of brain -body communication in the integration of mood and therefore in depression. 
Information travelling from the body to the brain through the dorsal horns in th e spinal cord is essential to provide 
consciousness of emotional experience in a process called interoceptive awareness. This information is then used by the 
brain to adjust bodily function through hypothalamic and autonomic outputs. Increased sympathetic activity and somatic 
symptoms have been documented in MDD and suggest disturbed brain -body communication. Spinal cord stimulation 
(SCS) has been used in the past to decrease sympathetic activity and  modulate spinal input to the brain. I ndirect evidence 
suggests that SCS might have antidepressant effect s. Transcutaneous  spinal direct current stimulation (tsDCS ) devices 
represent an effective, non -invasive, low cost alternative to surgically implanted SCS  devices . We believe that extant data 
support our overar ching HYPOTHESIS that an altered sensory input to the brain through the dorsal horns of the spinal cord 
contributes to the pathophysiology of depressive symptoms and that tsDCS  will be effective and safe in treating MDD by 
decreasing sympathetic activity a nd restoring metabolic function. Thus, we aim to 1) determine the efficacy and safety of 
tsDCS  in adult patients with MDD and 2) investigate interocepti ve awareness, somatic symptoms , autonomic and 
metabolic regulation as potential mediators of antidepressant response to tsDCS . We predict that 1) Active tsDCS  
treatment will result in a greater decrease in depressive symptom severity compared to Sham  tsDCS  in adult patients with 
MDD, 2) active tsDCS  will be safe and well tolerated in adult patients with MDD and 3) change in interoceptive awareness, 
somatic symptoms, and autonomic and metabolic parameters will be associated with change in depressive symptom 
severity.  To a ccomplish these ai ms, we will conduct  an 8 -week, double blinded, randomized, sham controlled, parallel 
group, pilot clinical trial study design. A total of 20 adult antidepressant -free MDD patients will be randomized to receive  
Active (n=10) or Sham (n=10) tsDCS  protocols f or 8 weeks in a 1:1 ratio. As an initial test of our hypothesis, we will combine 
the use of a tsDCS  device, psychometric instruments to diagnose MDD (M.I.N.I.), and measure s of depressive symptom 
severity (MADRS and PHQ -9), somatic symptoms (4DSQ), interoc eptive awareness (MAIA), autonomic function (blood 
pressure, heart rate) , and po tential  metabolic markers (cortisol , LCn-3 fatty acids , adiponectin, leptin , insulin  and 
fibroblast growth factor -21) known to be regulated by sympathetic activity as predictor s of response. This will be the first 
pilot study to eva luate the potential antidepressant effects of tsDCS  in adult patients diagnosed with MDD. It is anticipated 
that the results of this pilot  clinical  trial will provide preliminary data in support of a larger future trial that will additionally 
incorporate neuroimaging to investigate central mechanisms.

A. SPECIFIC AIMS  AND HYPOTHESIS :  
Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a recurrent and often chronic mood disorder that affects 14 % of the adult 
population during their lifetime  (1). MDD seriously undermines an ind ividual’s potential by reducing  the ability to 
function, quality of life, increasing suicide risk, morbidity, mortality , and health related cost  (2). Current therapeutic 
options used to treat MDD are effective in onl y a portion of patients and new treatment alternatives are urgently 
needed.  
Mood can be viewed as the subjective experience that results from the integration of corporeal sensory input travelling 
through the spinal cord (lamina I) and the vagus  nerve   which convey spinal and parasympathetic  information , 
respectively (3) to the nucleus of the tractus solitarius (NTS)  in the brainstem . This informa tion is then relayed to the 
thalamus and finally to the insula, where it is interpreted in a process called interoceptive awareness (4). This process 
allows human awareness of homeostasis and a cinemascopic version of emotional experience (5, 6) . Thus, interoceptive 
awareness is an essential part of mood and seems to play an important role in MDD (7).  
The brain uses the information gathered from the body to adjust corporeal function  through hypot halamic and 
autonomic outputs (8). During a depressive episode, patients experience autonomic dysregulation suggesting that the 
sensory input to the brain might be disturbed and play a r ole in the pathogenesis of MDD (9). Specifically,  increased 
sympathetic tone is ass ociated with  depression (10), and there is evidence that a sympathetic block (11) or drugs which 
affect sensory input to the brain have an antidepressant effect (12). Currently invasive and non -invasive 
neuromodulation treatments for depression exist in the form of transcranial magnetic stimulati on (TMS) (13), 
transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) (14), deep brain stimulation (DBS) and vagal nerve stimulation  (15). 
However, their effectiveness, risk,  cost and limited device portability limit their widespread clinical application.   
Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) has been safely and effectively used to treat pain syndromes for decades (16). Because of 
its sympatholytic effect, SCS has been widely used  to treat peripheral vascular disease (17) and angina (18). Clinical trials 
of SCS in these conditions provide  preliminary evidence for benefits of SCS in depressive symptom outcome s (19-23); an 
effect that has been shown to occur independent of pain reduction (22, 23) . However , in these  trials depression and 
psychopathology were exclusionary and the potential antidepressant effects of SCS have not yet been systematically 
studied in MDD patients (24, 25) . There is therefore a significant knowledge gap regarding the efficacy of SCS for the 
treatment of MDD, and addressing this gap may provide an innovative approach for treating MDD.  
Anodal transc utaneous spinal direct current stimulation  (tsDCS ) devices are available  for investigational use and 
represent a low cost, non -invasive alternative to surgically implanted spinal cord stimulators. We therefore believe that 
extant data support our overarching  HYPOTHESIS  that an altered sensory input to the br ain through the dorsal horns of 
the spinal cord contributes to the patho physiology  of depressive symptoms and that tsDCS  will be effective and safe in 
4 
 treating MDD by modulating spinal input to the brain, decreasing sympathetic activity , and restoring meta bolic function  
as a consequence . As an initial test of our hypothesis, we will combine the use of a tsDCS  device, psychometric 
instru ments to diagnose MDD , and measure s of depressive sy mptom severity, anxiety and somatic symptoms , 
interoceptive aware ness , autonomic function , and possible  metabolic markers known to be regulated by sympathetic 
activity as predictors  of response. Additionally, adverse events will be documented to evaluate safety and tolerability.  
Specific Aim 1:  To determine the efficacy and safety of tsDCS  in patients diagnosed with MDD. Prediction 1 : Active tsDCS  
treatment will result in a greater decrease in depressive symptom severity (MADRS) compared to sham  tsDCS  in adult 
patients with MDD. Prediction 2:  Active tsDCS will be safe and well tolerated in adult patients with MDD.  
Specific Aim 2: To investigate interoceptive awareness, anxiety and somatic symptoms , autonomic and metabolic 
regulation as potential mediators of antidepressant response to tsDCS .  Predictio n 3: Change in interoceptive awareness, 
somatic symptoms, and autonomic and metabolic parameters will be associated with change in depressive symptom 
severity.  Prediction 4:  Active tsDCS treatment will result in a greater decrease in depressive symptom sub -components, 
interoceptive awareness, anxi ety and somatic symptoms , autonomic and meta bolic parameters.    
To accomplish these aims, we will randomize 20 adult antidepressant -free MDD patients to active (n=10) or sham (n=10) 
tsDCS  protocols for 8 weeks in a double blind 1:1 ratio. We will evaluate  clinical , autonomic , and metabolic variables that 
may be  involved in the proposed mechanism as possible mediators of antidepressant response. This will be the first 8 -
week, double blinded, randomized, s ham controlled, parallel group pilot clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety 
of tsDCS  in adult patients with MDD. It is anticipated that the results of this pilot trial will provide preliminary data in 
support of a larger future trial that will additionally incorporate neuroimaging to investigate central mech anisms.  
 
B. BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE :  
B.1 Public Health Significance:  
Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a highly prevalent and recurrent neuropsychiatric disorder that affects millions of 
people worldwide (26). In the United States, it is estimated that 14% of the population will suffer MDD during their 
lifetime (1). Mental disorders represent a leading cause of years lived with disability worldwide and depressive disorders 
account for 40% of disability adjusted  life years caused by mental disorders  (26). MDD impairs  ability to function  and 
increases suffering, suici de risk, metabolic comorbidity, cardiovascular risk, morbidity/mortality and health care costs  (2, 
27, 28) .  Current antidepressant medication effectiveness is variable and benefits only a portion of patients with small to 
moderate effect sizes  and  low response and remission rates (29-32). Other available treatments for depression , such as 
adjunctive  medications  (33, 34)  and invasive or non -invasive neuromodulation  (14), also show limited efficacy. Of note, 
current antidepressant strategies differ in their putative mechanism of action, but overla p in their targeted central 
neuropathological processes  (antidepressant response) . The neurobiological origin of depression and thus the targets 
for specific treatment remain elusive. It is estimated that  treatment  with currently available antidepressants  alleviates  
less than half the burden of MDD (35). Hence, MDD is a significant public health problem and there is an urgent need to 
5 
 advance our understanding of the neuropathophysiology of MDD and guide the development of new treatment 
alternatives.  Our study  could offer both a novel, low cost, non-invasive neuromodulation treatment and a confirmation 
of an extra -cerebral component in MDD. Results could also generate a new research pathway for the development of 
novel treatments for MDD, other psychiatric disorders as well as their medi cal comorb idities.  
B.2 Brain -Body communication in the context of mood .  
Over  the past three decades, empirical evidence has grown to suggest that bi -directional brain -body communication is 
an essential component of emotional experience (3-5, 36 -38). However, we still lack an integrative model that includes 
this knowledge  in the cont ext of mental health and the treatment of psychiatric disorders.  
Our brain communicates with the body through neural and non -neural mechanisms that form a self -regulating circuit . 
For example, the hypothalamus is a complex neurological entity that represe nts just 0.3% (4cm3) of the adult brain, but 
is a key region to understand brain output to the body. It controls systems essential in many physiological, endocrine 
and behavioral processes , including, among others, sleep/wake  cycles, reproductive behavior,  metabolic and 
cardiovascular regulation (39). These processes are tightly linked to higher cortical functions such as emotional 
regulation, fear responses, executive function, memory  and pain and sen sory perception that allow brain -body 
organization. The hypothalamus  uses several  pathways to communicate  with  the body through  the outgoing hormonal 
and autonomic signals  that need to be adequately synchronized in order to maintain homeostasis. Autonomic signals 
prepare the organs of the body for the coming horm ones associated with the  time of the day, moment for the 
reproduction cycl e, feeding status and  temperature. The hypothalamus not only modulates pre -autonomic neuronal 
systems connected to sympathet ic and parasympathetic motor nuclei in brain stem and spinal cord, it also has hormonal 
'motor' neurons able to release their content in the circulation. In addition, the hypothalamus receives information from 
the body about the level of metabolites and ho rmones, blood pressure and the physiological state of organs and is richly 
connected to the cortex. Via these elaborate pathways, the hypothalamus maintains a balance for optimal functioning of 
brain and body and deleterious consequences  occur if this bal ance is lost or changed (8). 
The communication between hypothalamus and body is bidirectional in order to maintain physiological balance (5, 40, 
41). Somatic and sensory visceral information  travels through the spinal dorsal horn (lamina I) and nucleus of the tractus 
solitarius (NTS), which convey spinal and parasympathetic information respectively to the thalamus (3). The thalamus 
sends the relevant information to cortical areas including the insula, providing consciousness of the corporal situation in 
a pro cess called “interoceptive awareness” (4). At this level, the organization of information appears to be asymmetrical, 
with parasympathetic fibers signaling the left posterior insula, and spinal fibers to the right poste rior insula (3). Although 
evidence regarding how the information is gathered and lateralized from the body and sent to the insula in “emotions” 
is currently limited, insular activity lateralization in emotional processing has been confirmed (42). Information next 
travels to the medial insula where the process of interoceptive awareness takes place and forms a cinemascopic version 
of emotional experience; this is essenti al for emotional processing and regulation as well as other cognitive processes 
such as mot ivational behavior and decision -making (5, 43) . The NTS information is also sent directly to the hypothalamus 
6 
 which acts accordingly to react or adapt bodil y functions, and also sends and receives information to and from the 
prefrontal cortex (44). (Figure 1)  This complex neuronal crosstalk between body and brain is es sential for emotions , fear 
responses,  circadian organization, fe eding and sexual behavior, blood pressure and  temperature regulation , as well as  
energy metabolism (8). 
We view mood as the subjective experience that results from the integration of corporeal sensory input travelling 
through the spinal cord and NTS to the thalamus and then to the insula providing interoceptive awareness; which allows 
human awareness of home ostasis and the cinemascopic version of emotional experience (4, 5) . Under physiological 
conditions, signaling from the body to the brain would result in harmonious feedback to the hypothalamus and 
appropriate modulation of bodily functions via th e autonomic nervous system and contribute to a euthymic mood. 
Consequently, disturbed signaling from the body to the brain or from the  brain to the body could alter physiology and 
influence mood.  
 
Figure 1. Shows brain -body communication pathways.   Light /dark 
cycles  and food are among the biological signals that synchronize our 
brain and body physiology in activity / rest and digest periods 
corresponding to day/ night demands. The biological clock in the 
suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus s ignals the pre -
autonomic neurons in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) to adjust the 
physiology through the parasympathetic branch of the autonomic 
nervous system via the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus (DMV) and 
the sympathetic branch through the interme diolateral column (IML) to 
target organs. Visceral and somatic information travels back to the brain 
through the vagus and nucleus of the tractus solitarius (NTS), the 
lamina I in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord to the thalamus and then 
to the Right (R)  and/or Left (L) insula. Continuous arrows show efferent 
pathways; dashed arrows show afferents . .Another feedback between 
body and brain is through  hormonal and humoral factors  (green) .  
 
B.3 Disturbed brain -body communication in MDD : MDD is strongly asso ciated with stress, circadian rhythm disruption 
(45) and other environmental and genetic factors. It is characterized by a cluster of symptoms that include not only a 
low, sad or irritable moo d, but also decreased attention and motivation, self –defeat ing and suicidal thoughts , and 
disturbance of other cognitive domains, sleep, appetite and sexual interest (46). Additionally, anxiety, pain and other 
somatic complaints are present in more than half of patients experie ncing MDD (47). MDD is often recurrent  (48) and/or 
chronic  (49). To date, maybe the most consistent evidence of brai n-body communication disruption  in MDD has been 
reported in the form of direct or indirect measurements that indicate autonomic disturbance .

 B.3.1. Increased sympathetic activity  and distu rbed metabolism  in MDD . There is now a subst antial body of evidence 
showing  disturbed autonomic nervous system function in MDD. The evidence shows that the stress response system 
involving the hypothalamic -pituitary -adrenal axis and the sympatho -medullary system is hyperactive before, during and 
after depressive episodes (50). Evidence of such hyperactivity can be observed in the form of increased cortisol (51) and 
leptin (52), as well as decreased adiponectin (53) levels in patients  with MDD. Cortisol, adiponectin, leptin and fibroblast  
growth factor -21 (FGF -21) levels are a reflection of the autonomic output from the brain to the body; particularly 
sympathetic tone (54), which is also regulated by the biological clock located in the sup rachiasmatic nucleus of the 
hypothalamus (8, 55 -57). LCn-3 fatty acids  also play an important role in brain -body communication and are i nvolved in 
regulating circadian, and  autonomic function  (58, 59) . LCn-3 have been implicated in the pathophysiology and 
antidepressant treatment response of MDD  (60). It has also been reported recently that the metabolic hormone FGF-21, 
which is mainly produced by the liver, is an important s ignal for biological clock  regulation  (55) and it is largely driven  by 
sympathetic tone (61). It is unknown whether FGF -21 levels are changed during a depressive episode and if this levels 
could inform on the status of brain -body communication in MDD. Circadian cortisol release by the adrenal gland greatly 
depends on  sympathetic tone under the control of the biological clock and not entirely on ACTH release  (57). This could 
help explain why the dexamethasone s uppression test failed as a diagnostic tool and as a reliable predictor of treatment 
response for MDD patients (62). Increased cortisol level in MDD is often interpreted as a cause of MDD (63), but instead 
could be a consequence of other phenomenon such as a disturbed brain -body communication , such as  increased 
sympathetic tone. Increased sympathetic activity has also been documented in MDD patients in the form of decreased 
heart rate variability (64, 65) , which is inversely correlated with depressive symptom severity (66, 67) . It is therefore not 
surprising that MDD patients show increased comorbidity with obesity  (68), metabolic syndrome  (69) and diabetes  (70), 
all of which are associated with  increased sympathetic tone (71). Taken t ogether, this evidence suggests an important 
role of the autonomic nervous syst em and disturbed brain -body communication in the pathophysiology of MDD that 
could also explain the increased cardiovascular risk of this disorder  (28, 72) . It further  suggests the possibility that levels 
of metabolic marker s such as cortisol, adiponectin , leptin, and FGF -21 are disturbed during MDD as a consequence of 
increased sympathetic activity. If correct, decreasing sympathetic activity would be anticipated to reduce depressive 
symptoms, as well as  to “normalize”  metabolic risk biomarkers.  
B.3.2. Spinal cord stimulation  (SCS) , depressive symptoms and metabolism . Given its sympatholytic effect, SCS has 
been used to treat a variety of conditions associated with increased sympathetic tone, including peripheral vascular 
disease (17) and angina (18), but has not been directly studied for MDD treatment. The most widely used SC S 
application is chronic pain (73), a condition frequently comorbid with  depression (47). Among the trials published on SCS 
as an effective treatment for pain, a few report on depr essive symptom change.  Interestingly, SCS trials that report 
specific depression outcomes show an improvement in depressive symptom severity (21-23, 74) . At least two trials have 
shown no correlation between the effect of SCS in pain and depressive symptom improvement (22, 23) . Of note, a 
decre ase in depressive symptom se verity was observed even when severity  was mild. This is important , as clinical 
8 
 depression  in the form of MDD  was usually an exclusion criterion  for participat ion in such trials. Remarkably, a study on 
the effects of thoracic sympathetic block also showed a decrease in depressive symptom sever ity (11). Recently, 
although applied  at a cerv ical level, SCS was successfully used to decrease weight in morbidly obese patients by 
decreasing sympathetic activity and increasing parasympathetic activity (75). A recent study in rodents recently showed 
that spinal injury induced a long lasting depressive and anxious phenotype, underscoring the potential role of spinal  
function in the pathophysiology of depression and anxiety  (76). 
In ou r view, these results suggest a role for brain -body communication in the pathophysiology of MDD and an  unexplored 
antidepressant effect of SCS that is independent from the effect in pain. Such  antidepressant effect could be mediated 
through a decrease in spinal input from the spinal cord to the brain (via the dorsal horn) and/or from brain sympathetic 
output to the body (via the intermediolateral column).  Additionally, SCS could improve , cardio vascular and metabolic 
function through its  sympatholytic effects .   (Table 1)

B.3.3. Transcutaneous spinal direct current  stimulation ( tsDCS ) as a non -invasive neuromodulation alternative for 
surgically implanted spinal cord stimulators. SCS studies have focused on an invasive SCS modality using a dev ice that is 
implanted surgically. This is an effective, but invasive and expensive option for spinal cord stimulation. Spinal cord 
stimulation can also be achieved effectively, safely and at a lower cost through tsDCS  (77). Prelimi nary data shows  that 
tsDCS  promotes locomotor learning with long lasting 
effects after only three SCS sessions  (Awosika O, 
personal communication ). (Figure 2)  Anodal tsDCS  can 
inhibit ascending (78-80) and descending (81) spinal 
pathways.  This is consistent with the evidence 
showing that SCS decreases sympathetic to ne, which 
could be explained  by an inhibitory effect at  the 
intermediolateral column  (IML) or at  ascending  spinal  
pathways in the dorsal horn.                              
Figure 2. Shows tsDCS  effects in locomotor training.  
9 
 A resting state fMRI study with a double blind and cross -over design, recently showed that anodal tsDCS  at the T11 
spinous process at  an intensity of  2.5 milliampere ( mA) for 20 min resulted in a decreased connectivity between the 
primary somatosensory cor tex and the ipsilateral posterior insula for both left and right hemispheres. Anodal tsDCS  also 
induced decreased thalamic connectivity with the anterior cingulate cortex and increased connectivity between the 
primary somatosensory  cortex and the thalamus (82). We interpret these results as evidence of supraspinal effects of 
tsDCS and its potential to target and modify function in mood related brain regions such as the insula.  
Neuromodulation through tsDCS  is still an emerging technology. Several stimulation protocols have been studied to 
date. For example, at the cervical level  and using an anterior -posterior anodal stimulation , tsDCS  at 3 mA during 20 min 
was well tolerated, but showed no effect on descending motor pathways at cortical, spinal or moto r neuronal levels, and 
did not change efferent components of the H -reflex path way (83). This suggests that tsDCS , even at the cervical level,  is 
safe and does not affect motor pathways  at an intensity of up to 3.0mA .                    
B.4 Summary . 
We believe that the available evidence supports our overarching HYPOTHESIS that a disturbance in brain -body 
communication in the form of increased s ympathetic activity  and altered spinal input to the brain  is involved in the 
physiopathology of MDD and that tsDCS  represents a non -invasive tool to decrease sympathetic activity and  modulate 
spinal input to the brain in order to improve  depressive symptom  severity , while improving metabolic function. It is 
therefore anticipated that patients with MDD treated with active tsDCS  will show a greater decrease in depressive 
symptom severity compared to those receiving sham tsDCS .  Further, we expect that the mod ulation of sympathetic 
activity through tsDCS  will also modify clinical,  autonomic , and metabolic parameters  that could serve  as evidence of 
target engagement of the proposed brain -body circuit and  markers of antidepressant treatment response.  
 
C. INNOVATION.   
There is an urgent and unmet need for new and efficacious  antidepressa nt treatments and to improve the  
understanding on the ph ysiopathology of MDD. We will conduct the first  pilot  randomized controlled clinical trial to test 
the efficacy and safety of tsDCS for the treatment of MDD. In addition to providing evidence of a potentially  new 
treatment alternative for depression, we expect that our findings will aid in confirm ing the involvement of extracerebral 
neural pathways in the physiopathology of MDD and  provide novel biomarkers influenced by such pathways and 
possibly in response to treatment. In addition, our findings are anticipated to provide the foundation for a new research 
avenue for the development of neuromodulation strategies to treat other ment al disorders such as bipolar disorder, 
anxiety disorders, ADHD and their non -psychiatric medical comorbidities for which the proposed mechanisms may also 
be involved.  Within the framework of Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) the present proposal entails the perception and 
understanding of Self in the sub -construct of Agency , as well as the domains of Arousal/Regulatory systems and 
Circadian Rhythms . Our proposal also responds to the Strategic Plan for Research set for by the N ational Institute of

with  signif icant  autonomic effe cts (stimulants and antipsychotics allowed if dose stable for 1 month) ; 7) n eurological, 
endocrinological, cardiovascular  (including diagnosed hypertension)  or other clinically significant medical conditions  as 
judged by the clinician ; 8) skin lesions on electrode placement region; 9) implanted electrical medical devices; 10) 
Pregnancy ; 11) suspected IQ<80, and 12) any other clinically relevant reason as judged by the clinician.  
D.1.1. Psychometric evaluations. The Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview 5.0 ( MINI )(84) will be used to 
confirm the diagnosis  of current MDD  and evaluate the presence of comor bid psychiatric disorders . The Montgomery -
Asberg Depression Rating Scale  (MADRS )(85) will be used to evaluate depressive symptom severity and the Columbia 
Suicide Severity Rating Scale (CSSRS) (86) will be used to evaluate suicidality. The clinical global impression - severity (CGI -
S) and the clinical global impression -improvement (CGI -I) scales will be  used to evaluate the overall clinical severity and 
11 
 improvement of the illness (87).   Participants will also complete self -report instruments including the Patient Health 
Questionare -9 (PHQ -9) as a n additional  measure  of depressive symptom severity (88). The Four -Dimensional Symptom 
Questionnaire (4DSQ) (89) to measure distress, somatization and anxiety symptoms, the Binge Eating Scale (BES)  to 
measure eating behaviors and aspects of body perception (90) and the multidimensional assessment of interoceptive 
awareness (MAIA)  as a quantitative measure of interoceptive awareness (91). Participants will complete an electronic 
version of the emotion recognition task (92, 93)  and the stop signal task  (94, 95)  prior to tsDCS  (offline)  and during tsDCS 
(online) in order to obtain preliminary data on the effect of tsDCS on emotion recognition and cognitive function. A 
paper , electronic  and/or a REDcap electronic version of the inst ruments may be used to complete the psychometric 
evaluations.  
D.1.2. Spinal cord stimulator and stimulation protocol. The 2x2 Soterix® Medical transcutaneous spinal direct current 
stimulator  model 0707 -A device will be used. This is a tsDCS available only for investigational use,  with which Dr. 
Awosika has extensive experience  and will provide appropriate training to the study team.  This device will be 
appropriately labeled as an “Investigatio nal Device. Federal (Law) limits  device to investigational use ”. The device will be 
kept in a secured area inside the LCOH Research Institute and will be made available only to trained personnel of the 
study team. This device allows a nodal stimulation to b e delivered at 2.5mA per 20-minute  session or sham sessio n 
consisting of short pulses  (of the desired intensity)  at the beginn ing and end of the sessions. This protocol of a nodal 
stimulation has been reported to be effective in inhibiting ascending pathway s with a lasting effect, to be safe and well 
under the threshold for tissue damage (77, 79) . If stimulation intensity  (in active or sham protocols)  is not tolerable  at 
2.5mA , the clinician may decide  to decrease intensity to 2.0 mA or 1.5 mA. If 1.5  mA stimulation intensity is not 
tolerated, the subject may be  withdrawn from the study.  If subject has tolerated a stimulation intensity of less than 
2.5mA, the study clinician may  attempt to increase the dose to 2.0mA or 2.5mA when considered clinically appropriate. 
An anode electrode (5x10cm) will be placed at the level of the 10th vertebrae spinal process. At this level, the current is 
expected to spread longitudinally through th e spinal cord up to three additional vertebral levels (96). The cathode 
(5x7cm) electrode will be place d on the right shoulder  over the deltoid area  (78, 79, 97) . Participants will be scheduled 
to receive sham or active tsDCS  sessions three times/week. Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio using a simple 
allocation method to one of two experimental groups: 1) sham or 2) stimulation protocol. Randomization will be double -
blinded. An independent operator  (trained personnel from the research team)  will prepare the tsDCS device parameters 
for each session, but will not participate in the rest of th e assessments. Patients  and raters will remain blinded to SCS 
protocol assigned to each participant throughout the s tudy. During the session, subjects will remain in a calm and 
relaxing environment. All participants will be scheduled for the same procedures and number of  scheduled  visits during 
the eight -week follow -up period.  (Table 2 ) 
D.1.3. Blood and urine samples.  General : Blood samples  (approximately 20ml per occasion)  will be obtain ed on visit 0 
and 6 for a)  Hematology:  Complete blood count (CBC) ; b) electrolytes ; c) liver panel;  d) kidney panel ; e) lipid panel; f)  
other: glucose  and TSH.   A urine sample for urinalysis  will be collected at screening . A serum human chorionic

sample  processing for these tests  and urinalysis  will be  performed at Quest Diagnostics . Special focus  metabolic markers : 
Blood sample  (approximately 5ml per occasion)  will be obtained on visit 1 , 4 and 6 for: Adiponectin, leptin , cortisol , 
insulin and FGF -21 levels . Samples  will be processed using ELISA assays at the Biochemistry Core Laboratory from the 
Schubert Research Clinic at Cincinnati Children’ s Hospital . A blood sample  (approximately 5 ml per occasion) will be 
obtained for Fatty acid analyses: Patients (N=20) will ha ve their blood fatty acid composition determined by gas 
chromatography at visit 1, visit 4, and visit 6 at no cost by the Lipidomics Research Program which is Directed by Dr. 
McNamara (Co -Investigator).   
D.1.4. Cardiovascular measurements.  Blood pressure will be obtained before and after SCS sessions through the 
auscultatory technique using a standard mercury sphygmomanometer in a sitting position after 5 min utes  of rest. An 
ECG tracin g will be obtained through standard 12 -lead electrocardi ography  at visit 0, 1, 4 , and 6 . For the purpose of this 
study, we will consi der blood pressure  and heart rate  as variables to assess cardiovascular autonomic function.  
D.1.5. Anthropometric measures . Height will be obtained at screening. Weight , Waist and  abdominal circumference  and 
Body Mass Index (BMI)  will be measured on  visits 0, 1, 3, 4, 5 and 6 . 
D.2. Protocol visits.

 study, including potential risks and benefits of participating and will agree to partici pate by reading and signing an 
informed consent  (See informed consent form attached to this protocol) . The informed consent form will be written in a 
language that is understandable for potential participants. The study team will be available to answer any  questions before 
the potential participant decides to sign the informed consent form.  All required study documentation will be  confidential 
and archived as required by regulatory authorities.  Data and Safety Monitoring Plan : This plan will include monitor ing of 
efficacy and safety data by an independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) that will meet every six months and will 
provide oversight and monitoring to ensure the safety of participants and the validity and integrity of the data. Detailed 
inform ation on the  Data and Safety Monitoring plan and  DSMB is contained in  Protection of Human Subjects section of  
this protocol . 
 
E. OUTCOMES  
Primary Outcome: Difference in change from baseline to week 8 (or last available observation) in MADRS scores between 
active and sham tsDCS groups. Secondary Outcome:  a) differences in AE’s frequency between active and sham tsDCS 
groups, b) association between change from baseline to week 8 (or last available observation) in MADRS scores, and 
clinical  (CGI -I, CGI -S, PHQ -9, MAIA, BES and 4DSQ) , autonomic  (BP, HR ) and metabolic (anthropometric , adiponectin, 
leptin, cortisol , FGF-21 and LCn -3) parameter change f rom baseline to week 8 (or last available observation) , and c) MADRS  
sub-component (98) scores , clinical parameters (CGI -I, CGI -S, PHQ -9, MAIA, BES and 4DSQ), autonomic  (BP, HR ), and 
metabolic  (anthropometric , adiponectin, leptin, cortisol , insulin, FGF-21 and LCn -3) parameters  change from baseline to 
week 8 (or last available observation) differen ce betw een Active and Sham  tsDCS  groups.  Exploratory outcome measures:  
a) difference in change from baseline to week 8 (or last available observation) in  offline  ERT and Stop signal task scores  
between active and sham tsDCS groups ; and b) difference in cha nge from baseline to week 8 (or last ava ilable observation) 
in offline and online change ERT and s top signal task scores  between active and sham tsDCS groups  
F. SAFETY MEASURES   
Potential Risks.  Safety evaluation will consist in recording all laboratory test s, vital signs and ECG results, suicidality 
monitoring  (each SCS session) , physical and neurological examinations and any adverse events (AE). As mentioned above, 
literature suggests that current density below 25 mA/cm2 induces no tissue dam age (99). Findings will be r ecorded as AEs 
at the discretion  of the inv estigator.  Known side effects to tsDCS  are paresthesia, redness, itch, or pai n in stimulated area. 
If they occur , these side effects tend to disappear within minutes to hours after stimulation.  To our knowledge, n o serious 
adverse effects have been reported with the use of transcutaneous direct current stimulation protocols using 2.5mA/cm2 
(100) .   
Risk/Benefit Assessment.  Participants will be informed that there are other FDA approved treatment alternatives for 
major depressive disorder and that their participation in this study is voluntary. Therapeutic options include 
antidepressant medications, psychotherapy, invasive and non -invasive neuromodulation tools. Participants will also be 
15 
 informed that tsDCS is an in vestigational  technique that has been used in humans for other purposes , but this study will 
be the first to explore tsDCS as a potential treatment for major depressive disorder. It is expected that tsDCS will be 
effective and safe in treating depressive s ymptoms, while improving other aspects of brain -body communication as 
indicated by improvement in interoceptive awareness, anxiety and somat ic symptoms, auto nomic , and metabolic 
parameters.    
Adverse events. As defined by the ICH and GCP guidelines, any u ntoward medical occ urrence in a patient  during the 
administration of the investigational procedure and which does not have a causal relationship with treatment will be 
considered an AE. 
Early withdrawal. A subject may voluntarily decide to end participation at any point during the study. Clinical investigators 
may decide to end study participation of any subject if it is in the best interest and/or safety of the subject. If at any po int 
during the study a patient has a MADRS suicide item score > one point higher than their visit 1 ( baseline ) score  for any 
one week, or a score of > 4 ; or active suicidal behavior on the C -SSRS; or appears to the investigator to pose a risk of self -
harm or harm to others,  the patient  may  be withdrawn from the study. Additionally, patients will be withd rawn from the 
study (and referred for treatment  as clinically indicated) if there is a worsening of symptoms at visit 2  or later, as indicated 
by a CGI -I score of ≥ 6 or more at a ny time during the study or a minimal  worsening of symptoms at visit 3  or later as 
indicated by a CGI -I score of ≥ 5 at 2 consecutive visits, starting at visit 2 ; or a 50% increase over baseline in total MAD RS 
rating and a total MADRS> 28 , at visit 3  or la ter. Patients will also be withdrawn from the study at week 3 or later if they 
demonstrate a ten-point  increase from baseline in MADRS score for two successive weeks  starting at visit 2 . In addition, 
all patients will be assess ed with the C -SSRS on every t sDCS session  to elicit risks of potential suicidality. During study 
participation, a study related clinical investigator will closely monitor all study participants at each study visit for suic idal 
or homicidal ideation, plan, or intent using clinical inte rviews as well as the information obtained from rating scales. 
Transient suicidal ideation will not result in study discontinuation or referral for inpatient care since this may be common 
for patients with major depressive disorder. In order to maximize su bject safety, if a subject exhibits active suicidal or 
homicidal ideation during study participation that, in the judgment of a clinical study investigator, cannot be managed on 
an outpatient basis, he/she will be  withdrawn from the study and  referred fo r inpatient psychiatric care. Patien ts with 
active suicidal behavior may  be removed from the study based on C -SSRS criteria, as noted above. All subjects who 
discontinue stu dy participation prior to visit 6  will be asked to  voluntarily undergo endpoint study  procedures, if feasible. 
Additionally, all study participants will be provided with study physician contact information and instructed to contact 
their study physician 24 hours/day, 7 days/week in between visits should suicidal or homicidal ideation or an y other 
emergency situation occur. If a participant becomes pregnant during the study, participation will be stopped, and the 
event will be documented as a serious adverse event. The participant will be referred for appropriate medical treatment 
and follow  up with primary care physician and followed by the study team throughout the pregnancy and the outcome 
documented as required by the IRB and institutional guidelines. We have successfully followed this protocol in our prior 
16 
 outcome and clinical trials stu dies. A study physician will work with the patient to arrange admission i n the event that it is 
determined that a study participant needs psychia tric or medical hospitalization.  
G. SAMPLE SIZE.  
This is an exploratory pilot clinical trial for which  up to 60 (including screen fails) participants will be screened in an effort 
to recruit  20 participants that will  receive either sham (n=10) or active treatment (n=10)  for 8 weeks .  Recruitment efforts 
will be aimed at a 2 patient/month rate . The explorat ory nature of the study precludes a sample size that w ould enable 
detection of small  but still clinically relevant effects at convent ional significance thresholds. However, estimates of effect 
sizes with confidence intervals will be useful as inputs to lar ger confirmatory studies if these effects fall in an appropriate 
range (i.e., at least moderate sample effect sizes of approximately 0.50 standard deviations), even if the conventional 
significance is not achieved.  
H. FEASIBILI TY OF RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION  
Resources and Infrastructure: The University of Cincinnati (UC) College of Medicine, Department of Psychiatry was 
founded in 1932 and UC is the 14th largest recipient of NIH funding. Among departments of Psychiatry, UC has one of the 
largest psychopharmaco logy research programs in the United States dedicated to depression and bipolar disorder. The 
faculty has a long -term successful record of sustained research support related to mood, eating, and impulse control 
disorders and pharmacological treatments.   
The Lindner Center of HOPE (LCOH) is a nonprofit 91,820 square foot Mental Health facility affiliated with the University 
of Cincinnati and located in Mason, Ohio. LCOH provides comprehensive mental health, substance abuse, and dual 
diagnosis services. The Center was a founding member of the National Network of Depression Centers (NNDC), de facto 
recognition as a center of excellence in the treatment and research of mood disorders. The facility is located on 36 acres

state -of-the-art protection of patient -identified electronic data. The LCOH IT staff has expertise in web development and 
already manages the LCOH website (www.lindnercenter.org) in coordination  with the marketing department.  
I. DATA MANAGEMENT AND ANALYSIS.  
Data management and  analyses will be organized and performed by the r esearch team under the guidance  of Dr. Jeffrey 
Welge, Director of the Division of Biostatistics in the Department of Psychia try at the University of Cincinnati, who has 
participated in the development of this analytic plan. Data will be collected via  Case Report Forms. The research 
coordinator will be responsible for managing the study flow, maintaining case report forms, and e ntry data into a 
password -protected  database  on REDcap .  
Data Analysis. Specific Aim 1 : Prediction 1 ) Active tsDCS  treatment will result in a greater decrease in depressive symptom 
severity (MADRS) compared to Sham in adult patients diagnosed with MDD. Efficacy:  Longitudinal effect of tsDCS will be 
assessed by comparing change in MADRS scores from baseline to week 8  (or last available observation) . To take maximum 
advantage of intermediate observations while avoiding assumptions about the trajectory of change over time, we will use 
a repeated -measures ANOVA model (i.e., with time as a categorical variable), and the pri mary hypothesis test will be a 
planned contrast of the baseline -week 8 differences between groups. Prediction 2)  Active tsDCS  is safe and well tolerated 
in adult patients diagnosed with MDD. Safety : A similar analysis as used for efficacy data will be perf ormed for laboratory 
assays, vital signs, anthropometric, clinical, autonomic and metabolic variables. Frequencies of AE’s will be compared 
between groups using comparative analysis. Specific Aim 2 : Prediction 3 ) Baseline and change in interoceptive awaren ess, 
18 
 somatic symptoms, clinical, autonomic and metabolic parameters will be associated with change in depressi ve symptom 
severity. A correlation  analysis will be used to evaluate  the association between treatment and depressive  symptom 
severity, both total  and in components (items) . Correlation analysis will also be performed  by gender,  autonomic and 
metabolic parameters. Prediction 4) Active tsDCS treatment w ill result in a greater change  in interoceptive awareness, 
anxiety and soma tic symptoms , clinical, autonomic and metabolic parameters.  Longitudinal effect of tsDCS will be 
assessed by comparing MADRS sub -component scores, clinical parameters (CGI -I, CGI -S, PHQ -9, BES, MAIA, and 4DSQ), 
autonomic,  and metabolic parameters change from baseline to week 8 (or last available observation) difference between 
Active and Sham groups using a repeated -measures ANOVA as described above. Throughout, tests and confidence 
intervals for effect sizes will be two -sided, α=0.05.  
J. PROTECTION OF HUMAN SUBJECTS.  
The data and safety monitoring plan for the proposed study will include monitoring of efficacy data by an independent 
Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) and monitoring of tolerability data, including adverse eve nts and serious adverse 
events, by the study investigators as well as the independen t DSMB  and the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine 
Institutional Review Board (IRB). The DSMB will consist of non -study related  faculty  with relevant research expe rience.  
Data Safety Monitoring Board. In order to maximize the safety of the study participants, in addition to adverse event 
monitoring by study investigators, the proposed study will also have a Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB). The DSMB 
will consist  of non -study related faculty with research related experience and will include a psychiatrist with expertise in 
clinical research and mood disorders (Fabbiano Neri, MD , PhD ), a psychiatrist or neurologist with experience in non -
invasive neuromodulation  (Jonathan Cole, DO ), and a researcher with experience in biostatistics or a biostatistician 
(Thomas Blom , MS ). The DSMB  members will not have a potential conflict of interest in study related outcomes. The 
DSMB will meet a minimum of every 6 months during the course of the study and will review tolerability, safety and 
efficacy data. The DSMB will also review all SAEs at t he time of their occurrence and provide recommendations based on 
this review (e.g., that the study may continue or they may recommend modifications, including additional tolerability 
and efficacy measures). Every six months the DSMB will formally review al l adverse events as well as all efficacy and 
tolerability data. Dr. Romo -Nava will be responsible for providing updated efficacy and tolerability data to the DSMB 
every six months and the person with the blinded information will provide information on trea tment group assignment 
without breaking the blind. The DSMB will assess the risks and benefits of study participation to all subjects and based 
on this assessment the DSMB will provide a written report of their analyses and recommendation as to whether the  
study should continue, modifications to the study are needed or if the study should be terminated. Dr. Romo -Nava in 
conjunction with the DSMB, will be responsible for making certain that the DSMB files their report to the IRB and/or 
other authorities as r equired. The DSMB will also provide the investigator with a summary of their report that will 
include their recommendations.  
19 
 Adverse events will be monitored during the study by the clinical research team, which  includes Psychiatrists and a 
Neurologist and  collectively have extensive experience co nducting clinical investigation  of mood disorders and in the 
case of Dr . Awosika, the use of transcutaneous spinal  direct current  stimulation for neurological rehabilitation. They 
also will be responsible for evalu ating and documenting all adverse events during study visits or more frequently as 
necessary. Additionally, a study -related physician will be accessible by phone to patients 24 hours/day, 7 days/week 
during study participation. Dr. Rom o-Nava and designated  clinical researchers  will be responsible for reviewing all 
laboratory and safety measures from all subjects following each visit. An adverse event (AE) is any unexpected medical 
occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject who is administered  a product and which does not necessarily 
have a causal relationship with the treatment. This includes any clinical or laboratory change that occurs at any time 
following consent that does not typically occur in that subject and is considered clinically si gnificant. The frequency and 
severity of all observed or volunteered AEs regardless of treatment group or suspected causal relationship to the study 
treatment will be recorded throughout the study. Dr. Romo -Nava and designated clinicians will also be respo nsible for 
determining causal relationships between the study treatment and all AEs. Withdrawal from the study as a result of an 
AE or because of therapeutic measures taken to treat an AE will be at the discretion of the PI. If a subject withdraws or 
is wi thdrawn from the study for any reason, a study physician will monitor subjects with any ongoing AE until the AE is 
resolved or determined to be stable. All AEs (including those present during screening) will be reported. However, for 
analytics purposes, on ly post -baseline (randomization) AEs (or AEs that are present at visit 1/ baseline but have 
increased in severity or frequency post -baseline) will be considered for calculating treatment group differences in AEs. 
All AEs will be reported to the study DSMB,  and the IRB at the time of progress reports.  
A serious adverse event (SAE) is any adverse experience occurring during study participation that results in any of the 
following outcomes: death; a life threatening adverse drug experience; inpatient hospitali zation or prolongation of 
existing hospitalization; a persistent or significant disability/incapacity; or a congenital anomaly/birth defect. Important 
medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require hospitalization may be consi dered serious 
adverse events when, based on appropriate medical judgment of the study physician, they may jeopardize the patient 
or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes in this definition. The 
judgment of whether a particular AE meets the above criteria for an SAE for the proposed study will be determined by 
the PI, in conjunction with the proposed Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB). It will also be the PIs responsibility to 
manage all SAEs and to make ref errals for appropriate care, as necessary. All SAEs will be reported to the University of 
Cincinnati Institutional Review Board and the study DSMB within 48 hours of their discovery. The study blind will be 
broken at any point throughout the study as neede d to protect the safety of a subject. A person with the blinded 
information will be available 24 hours/day, 7 days/week if it is necessary to break the blind in an emergency situation. 
All subject information will be de -identified when reporting serious ad verse events. All AEs and SAEs will be double 
entered  into two separate databases (and checked for accuracy) that are de -identified and password protected to 
ensure confidentiality. Dr. Romo -Nava  and the study team  will ensure that all patients have approp riate follow -up care  
20 
 options  after their study participation, as previously described.  
 
K. DATA AND SAMPLE STORAGE AND CONFIDENTIALITY.  
All subject information/binders will be kept in locked file cabinets behind locked doors in the locked research suite. 
Subject binders will contain identifiable inf ormation. A master file/key with  subject identifie rs (typically initials and date 
of birth) will be kept in a locked password protected database to which only relevant study staff will have access. 
Subje ct information will be placed in  a password -protected computer database, and will be available only to the 
principal investigators and research team members who are directly involved in entering and analyzing the data. The 
master file/key will exist u ntil all study related analyses and publications are completed. Every effort will be made to 
maintain the confidentiality of study records. Agents of the University of Cincinnati Medical Center Institutional Review 
Board and the Lindner Center of Hope may be allowed to inspect records related to this study. The data obtained from 
the study may be published; however, participants will not be identifiable in such publications. Participant identity will 
remain confidential unless disclosure is required by law.  The records of this research study will be kept confidential and 
will not be given to anyone who is not helping conduct this study unless specifically requested and waived by the 
participant. To further ensure confidentiality, study records will be kept i n locked file cabinets and/or in computers  and 
tablets  with passwords, all in locked rooms here at the Lindner Center of Hope. Additionally, participant identification is 
coded with letters and numbers to de -identify individuals. As required, this study wi ll be in full compliance of HIPAA.

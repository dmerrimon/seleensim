1.1. Introduction 
Etigilimab, a humanized immunoglobulin G ( IgG1 ) monoclonal antibody that specifically binds 
to human TIGIT (T- cell immunoreceptor with Ig and ITIM domains), blocks TIGIT interaction 
with its ligand  PVR (poliovirus receptor), inhibits downstream signaling, and mediates target cell 
killing. Anti- TIGIT was shown preclinically  to inhibit tumor growth in mouse models. 
Etigilimab is being developed for the treatment of solid cancer tumors in humans. 
1.2. Background 
TIGIT  is an important co -inhibitory receptor ; it contains 2 immunoreceptor tyrosine- based 
inhibition motifs (ITIMs) and i ts expression at the surface of immune cells is markedly increased 
upon activation. TIGIT is found on CD4 and CD8 T- cells, on natural killer (NK) cells, and on a 
subset of Tregs ( regulatory T cells)  (Chan et al 2012, Yu et al 2009, Joller et al 2014 ). Consistent 
with its structure and expression pattern, TIGIT was found to have an inhibitory function on both 
T-cells and NK cells and to increase Tregs’ suppressive capacity ( Joller et al 2014, 
Joller et  al 2011, Levin et al 2011, Stanietsky et al 2009). Known ligands for TIGIT are PVR, 
PVRL2, and with weaker binding, PVRL3 and PVRL4 ( Yu et al 2009 ) (data on file  at Mereo ). 
The TIGIT signaling axis a lso contains a co -stimulatory receptor, CD226, which binds to PVR 
and PVRL2 with lower affinity than TIGIT (Bottino et al 2003, Martinet & Smyth 2015 ). 
Therefore, when TIGIT is expressed, the ligands preferentially engage TIGIT rather than CD226, leading to immune suppression. 
Given TIGIT’s immunomodulatory functions and the expression of PVR and PVRL2  in most 
cancers ( Stanietsky et al 2009, Gromeier et al 2000 ), it has been postulated that blocking TIGIT 
binding to its ligands may reverse tumor-induced immune suppression and result in tumor 
regression in a broad range of cancer types ( Figure  1).

Legend: PVR gene expression levels are plotted for 3 2 different tumor types as available from The Cancer Genome 
Atlas ( TCGA ). Each symbol represents one patient. Levels are expressed in reads per kilobase  per million ( RPKM).   
 
The anti- tumor activity of TIGIT blockade was verified in different murine cancer models where 
it was shown to operate through multiple mechanisms to inhibit tumor growth 
(Johnston et  al 2014, Kurtulus et al 2015). Further supporting TIGIT tar geting for cancer 
treatment are reports of its overexpression on patient tumor- associated T -cells 
(Johnston et  al 2014, Chauvin et al 2015).  
TIGIT targeting is likely to be most efficient when combined with other immunotherapies. In preclinical and clinical studies, targeting TIGIT together with the programmed death-
1/programmed death ligand-1 ( PD-1/PD -L1) pathway demonstrated superior tumor suppression 
compared to either monotherapy.  
A Phase 1a/b open-label, dose-escalation study was conducted to evaluate  the safety and 
pharmacokinetics (PK)  of etigilimab administered  as a single agent or in combination with 
nivolumab to subjects with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors  (study number 
313M32- 001). A total of 23 subjects were enrolled on the Phase 1a portion of the study for 
treatment with etigilimab and 10 subje cts were enrolled on the Phase 1b portion of the study for 

Mereo Biopharma 5 , Inc . Etigilimab  
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 7 of 110 treatment with etigilimab in combination with nivolumab. Doses investigated in the Phase 1a 
portion of the study were  mg/kg (for dose- escalation ) and  mg/kg (for dose-
expansion) , and doses evaluated in the Phase 1b dose-escalation portion of the study were  
 mg/kg. To characterize the PK properties of etigilimab and pharmacodynamic responses 
to treatment, blood samples were taken at various timepoints before and afte r dosing. Subjects 
underwent tumor assessments at screening and every 8 weeks during the study. Subjects remained on treatment at the discretion of the investigator until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, initiation of a new anticancer therapy, w ithdrawal of subject consent, 
physician decision, or death. Efficacy endpoints included tumor response. Time- to-event 
endpoints included duration of response (DoR) , progression- free survival  (PFS) , and overall 
survival. Safety endpoints included adverse events ( AEs), vital signs, 12- lead electrocardiograms 
(ECGs) , clinical laboratory testing, and immunogenicity testing.  
Treatment with etigilimab was well-tolerated in study 313M32-001; no dose -limiting toxicities 
(DLTs ) were reported in either the Phase 1a o r Phase 1b portions of the study. Thus, the 
maximum tolerated dose  was not reached. All subject s in the study reported 1 or more treatment-
emergent AEs (TEAEs). The most commonly reported TEAEs in the Phase 1a portion of the study were nausea (8 subject s, 34.8%) and fatigue (7 subjects, 30.4%), and the most commonly 
reported TEAEs in the Phase 1b portion of the study were decreased appetite and nausea (each reported by 5 subjects, 50.0%). Immune- related TEAEs were reported by 10  subject s (43.5%) in 
the Phase 1a and 5 subjects (50.0%) in the Phase 1b portions of the study. The most commonly reported immune-related TEAEs in the Phase 1a portion of the study were pruritus, rash, and maculopapular rash (each reported by 3 subjects, 15.0%). In the Phase 1b portion of the study, the most commonly reported immune -related TEAEs were pruritus, rash, and pruritic rash (each 
reported by 2 subjects, 20.0%). The most commonly reported National Cancer Institute Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) Grade 3 or higher abnormal laboratory 
test results in the Phase 1a portion of the study were lymphocytes (8 subject s 34.8%), alkaline 
phosphatase (3 subject s 13.0%), and alanine aminotransferase  (ALT)  and sodium (each reported 
by 2 subjects, 8.7%). In the Phase 1b portion of the study, the most commonly reported CTCAE 
Grade 3 or higher laboratory results were alkaline phosphatase (3 subject s, 30.0%) and aspartate 
aminotransferase (AST) (2 subject s, 20.0%). Treatment -emergent AEs with a fatal outcome were 
reported for 3 subjects (13.0%) in the Phase 1a portion of the study and 2 subjects (20.0%) in the 
Phase 1b portion of the study. There were no related TEAEs with a fatal outcome in the Phase 1a and the Phase 1b portions of the study. 
In the single agent portion of the study no Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 
(RECIST ) responses were reported . However , a number of subjects demonstrated tumor 
reduction or stable disease (SD) . The tumor types w here clinical  benefit was observed included 
endometrial, fallopian tube, parotid adenocarcinoma, salivary duct adenocarcinoma, and 
colorectal cancer. In the group who received both etigilimab and nivolumab, all subject s treated  
received a prior checkpoint point inhibitor. A partial response was observed in a patient with 
ovarian cancer, and other patients with microsatellite instability  (MSI ), colorectal  (CRC ), head 
and neck, gastric and renal cancer appeared to benefit with evidence of tumor reduction or stabilization.  
The median (95% confidence interval [ CI]) PFS in the Phase 1a portion of the study was 
56.0 (51.0, 112.0) days, and the PFS estimates (95% CI) at 3, 6, and 12 months were 30.0%

portion of the study was 57.5 (14.0, 224.0) days, and the PFS estimates (95% CI) at 3, 6, and 12 months were 37.5% (8.7, 67.4), 25.0% (3.7, 55.8), and 0%, respectively. The median (95% CI) overall survival in the Phase 1a portion of the study was 173.0 (88.0, 268.0) days, and the survival estimates (95% CI) at 3, 6, and 12 months were 30.0% (12.3, 50.1), 10.0% (1.7, 27.2), and 0%, respectively. The median (95% CI) overall survival in the Phase 1b portion of the study was 205.0 (19.0, N/A) days, and the s urvival estimates (95% CI) at 3 months were 57.9% 
(15.3, 85.2) and not applicable at 6 and 12 months. 
1.3. Study Design  
This is an open -label, multicenter, P hase 1b/2 basket study designed to evaluate the efficacy, 
safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) , and pharmacodynamics  (PD)  of etigilimab in 
combination with nivolumab in subjects with recurrent, locally advanced and/or metastatic solid tumors who are not candidates for available, curative standard of care therapies. In cohorts 
enrolling tumor types for whom anti -PD-1 antibody therapy is approved treatment for recurrent, 
locally advanced or metastatic disease, subjects may be enrolled prior to treatment wit h anti- PD-
1 antibody therapy.  
Subject s will be assigned to receive etigilimab (  mg every 2 weeks for subjects ≥50 kg, 
 mg/kg dose every 2 weeks for subjects <50 kg) in combination with nivolumab (240 mg 
every 2 weeks) and will continue until protocol- defined discontinuation criteria are met (refer to 
Section  7). Additional doses and schedules may also be evaluated.  This study will evaluate both 
subjects who have not previously been treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors (CPI) as well as those who have received prior CPI therapy and will include tumor types chosen for higher prevalence of TIGIT, and in select cohorts, subjects with high PD -L1 expressing tumors a s 
measured by immunohistochemistry ( IHC).  Tumor types selected for this study include 
recurrent, locally advanced and/or metastatic endometrial carcinoma (EC) , cervical cancer  (CC) , 
gastric cancer and gastro-esophageal junction carcinoma  (GC) , squamous cell carcinoma of the 
head and neck (HNSCC) , ovarian cancer  (OC) , rare cancers (metastatic testicular germ c ell 
tumor, uveal melanoma and sarcoma) and any subject with concomitant tumor mutation burden high (TMB- high) and microsatellite stable (MSS) tumors. As TIGIT has been implicated in PD -
L1 resistance, subjects who have received or progressed following a CPI (post- CPI subjects) will 
also be enrolled in select tumors including EC , HNSCC and TMB -high/MSS tumors. Parallel 
cohorts of up to 20 subjects per cohort will be evaluated. 
Cohorts will be enrolled at the discretion of the sponsor. Selected cohorts will be open for the 
first 20 subjects enrolled without increasing the total number of subjects pro posed for the trial. 
During the conduct of this open- label study an Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) 
will be established  and will review study data on an ongoing basis . The IDMC  will consist of at 
least 3 members with expertise in their field of practice as well as in the conduct of clinical studies . The committee members will be free of significant conflicts of interest. The IDMC will 
hold regularly scheduled data review meetings at pre- specified intervals as defined in the IDMC 
charter.  The IDMC will also be available on an ad hoc basis e.g., to provide guidance related to 
any emerging safety signals or if requested by the sponsor. 

Mereo Biopharma 5 , Inc . Etigilimab  
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 9 of 110 The IDMC will have p eriodic s afety review s of the study that will start after the  first 20 subjects 
are enrolled . A safety review of the study will be conducted by the IDMC approximately every 3 
months. The IDMC and sponsor may decide to meet less frequently, based upon rate of accrual 
and the amount of new data ge nerated  (refer to the IDMC charter). .  
Futility monitoring will be evaluated in each cohort of the study using a Simon’s two -stage 
design as described in Section 9.1 of the protocol. For each cohort, the second stage may  be 
opened for enrollment only after discussion with the IDMC and the sponsor. The sponsor may have an independent assessment of responses to verify investigator-reported responses. The responses based on independent assessments, if available, will be used for sensitivity analysis with sponsor and will make recommendations regarding study conduct, including whether to continue, modify, or stop the study. 
An analysis will be conducted when the first 30 TIGIT IHC biopsy results have been compl ete. 
This is to confirm the expected TIGIT positive rate based on data on file and reported in the 
literature. The efficacy of the combination will be evaluated by cohort and efficacy of the combination will be evaluated based on TIGIT IHC positive subjects.

1.4.1. Rationale for Study Design 
A number of checkpoint inhibitors  such as PD -L1 and PD-1 can act by blocking interactions 
between ligands and receptors on tumor cells and T cells and lead to enhanced anti- tumor 
immunity.  A number of anti-PD-1 inhibitors, including nivolumab  and anti- PD-L1 antibodies 
have been approved f or numerous indications. However, a large proportion of patients who 
receive CPI do not de rive a clinical benefit, progress or become resistant. Strategies improving 
the effectiveness or reversing  resistance to these agents in high unmet need indications are being 
studied.  
One such strategy  e xplored is inhibiting TIGIT.  It has  been postulated that blocking TIGIT 
binding to its ligands may reverse tumor-induced immune suppression and result in tumor 
regression in a broad range of cancer types. Etigilimab  is a novel immunotherapy that binds to 
TIGIT, an immune checkpoint protein found on immune cells. Both TIGIT and PD- 1 are 
involved in immune suppression and b locking both pathways have the potential for improving 
anti-tumor activity . 
A Ph ase 1 study of single agent e tigilimab (n = 23) and in combination with nivolumab (n = 10) 
in heavily pretreated advanced cancer subject s was completed. Clinical benefit was noted in 
subjects with endometrial, ovarian, head and neck, and some MSI high and TMB- H tumors  (data 
on file at Mereo) . Finally, other anti- TIGIT anti -bodies in development have reported 
preliminary evidence of potential clinical benefit by stabilization of disease  activity in both CPI 
naïve and post -CPI subjects in a number of tumor types including non- small cell lung cancer 
(NSCLC), small -cell lung cancer ( SCLC ), ovarian, cervical  and gastroesophageal  junction 
adenocarcinoma.  The tumor types selected for evaluation in this study have been identified based on the likelihood 
of high TIGIT /PVR expression and co-expression of both TIGIT and PD-1 ( Figure 3 and  
Figure 4).

The purpose of the study is to determine preliminary clinical activity of this combination in 
several selected tumor groups and identify which subject characteristics, based on histology, biomarker or prior therapy are most like to benefit from this combin ation.  
This open- label basket study trial design is the most effective to evaluate pan tumor safety and 
clinical activity by histology, TIGIT , and PD-L1 status.  
Subject selected for evaluation in this study all have advanced or metastatic  disease, who are not 
candidates for available, curative standard of care therapies, with cancer types considered as high unmet therapeutic need indications for which limited therapeutic options exist. Table  1 illustrates TCGA Detail TIGIT:PD1 (CD279) R (correlation)

1.4.2. Scientific Rationale for Selected Endpoints   
In oncology clinical trials, many different endpoints can be used as primary or secondary 
endpoints including OS , ORR,  DoR, disease co ntrol rate (DCR),  disease -free survival (DFS), 
and PFS. 
The ORR, as per RECIST v1.1, is an increasingly important endpoint for accelerated 
development of highly active anticancer therapies  and will be the primary endpoint for this 
study. Thi s surrogate marker , used in single arm studies, is able to evaluate earl y if there is a 
direct effect on tumor size  seen on radiology. The ORR has correlated with endpoints such as 
PFS and OS.  
As per Food and Drug Administration ( FDA) guidance document on oncology endpoints, OR R 
was chosen because : 
• ORR is g enerally assessed earlier and with smaller sample size compared with survival 
studies.  
• ORR measures the effect on tumor attributable to drug(s), not natural history .  
• ORR is g enerally based on objective and quantitative assessment .  
Additional secondary and exploratory endpoints that will also be evaluated include the 
following:  
The DoR is  defined as the time from first documented objective response (RECIST v1.1) by 
Independent Central Review until the date of documented disease progression. Cancer drugs 
that demonstrate improved DoR can produce a durable, meaningful delay in disease 
progre ssion, as opposed to a temporary response without any lasting benefit.  The DCR, as 
per RECIST v1.1 is a modification of ORR that includes subjects with SD  exceeding a minimum 
duration as responders. This may be a suitable preliminary or exploratory measure of antitumor activity for indications where complete  response (CR)  or partial responses (PR)  may be more 
difficult to attain, stable disease does not reflect the natural history of the disease, and SD is a 
clinically meaningful outcome. Duration of stable disease is measured from the start of the treatment (the first treatment date for non -randomized studies, the randomization date for 
randomized studies) until the date when the criteria for overall disease progression are first met also provides supportive data for assessment of clinical activity of experimental anti -cancer 
regimens.   
1.4.3. Justification for Dose  
 and Schedule  
The flat dose of etigilimab of  mg for subjects ≥50 kg was selected fo r MPH 313-1-02 based 
on data from study 313M32-001. In this study, a trough exposure of approximately 20 to  30 µ g/mL was associated with maximum reduction in Treg and maximal increase in Ki67 
biomarkers. This exposure was also associated with subjects who appeared to achieve clinical benefit from etigilimab . The trough exposure is this range can be obtained with a dose of 

Mereo Biopharma 5 , Inc . Etigilimab  
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 15 of 110  mg every 2 weeks.  S ee the Investigator Brochure Section 5.3.4 (data on file at Mereo) for 
more detailed information.  For subjects <50 kg, a weight-based dose of  mg/kg will be utilized  
to not exceed the highest dose examined in the 313M32-001 study.  
Nivolumab is an FDA-approved human IgG4 kappa immunoglobulin that blocks the interaction 
between PD -1 and its ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2 indicated for the treatment of advanced 
melanoma, NSCLC, renal cell carcinoma, Hodgkin lymphoma, advanced HNSCC, M SI-high or 
mismatch repair- deficient CRC, and hepatocellular carcinoma ( OPDIVO 2018 ). The mechanism 
of action of nivolumab involves blocking inhibiting signals mediated by the PD- L1/L2 -PD-1 
interaction on effector T -cell function leading to enhanced T- cell activity/immunosurveillance 
within the tumor microenvironment.  
Nivolumab is given at either 3 mg/kg or flat 240 mg intravenous ( IV) every 2 weeks ( Q2W ) with 
similar safety, PK and efficacy seen between the 2 dosing strategies in several FDA -approved 
tumor types ( OPDIVO 2018). For this study, nivolumab will be dosed at the flat rate of 240  mg 
IV Q2W. Clinical trial data on over 1900 patients treated with nivolumab as a single agent and 400 melanoma patients treated with nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab  provide a 
substantial database of safety information. Immu ne-related toxicities are common and 
well-described and include pneumonitis, colitis, hepatitis endocrinopathies, nephritis, skin 
reactions, encephalitis, infusion reactions and others. Many of these adverse effects are managed with corticosteroid immunosu ppression with interruption/stopping rules guided by the nivolumab 
package insert ( OPDIVO 2018 ). 
1.5. Benefit/Risk Assessment  
More detailed information about the known and expected benefits and risks and reasonably expected  adverse events ( AEs) of etigilimab  may be found in the Investigator’s Brochure (data 
on file at Mereo) . There are risks from some of the study -specific procedures. If a fresh tumor 
biopsy is required, the risks include pain and discomfort, bleeding, tenderness, scaring, and 
rarely infection. Uncommonly, complications from biopsies can be life threatening. Potentially 
serious complications from bleeding or organ damage may occur. These might require additional surgical intervention.  Collection of b lood samples may cause fainting, redness, pain, bruising, 
bleeding, and infection. The ECG sticky pads ma y cause redness or itching and if the hair under 
the patches needs to  be shaved, this may cause irritation of the skin.

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 28 of 110 3.3. Prohibited Concomitant Medications  and Treatments  
Use of the following therapies is prohibited during the study:  
• Any concomitant therapy intended for the treatment of subject’ s current cancer, 
whether health authority -approved or experimental, including (but not limited to) the 
following: chemotherapy, hormonal therapy for cancer treatment, immunotherapy, 
radiotherapy, investigational agents, or herbal therapy.  
• Immunostimulatory agents or immunotherapy not specified in the protocol. 
• Immunosuppressive medications, including but not limited to cyclophosphamide, azathioprine, methotrexate, thalidomide , and immunosuppressive doses of 
corticosteroids (i.e. >10 mg daily prednisone equivalent) . (These agents may be 
administered at the discretion of the treating physician in an emergency or after consultation with the Medical Monitor). 
• Surgical resection except for palliative surgical resection. 
3.4. Screen Failures 
Screen failures are defined as subject s who consent to participate in the clinical study but are not 
subsequently enrolled. A minimal set of screen failure information is required to ensure 
transparent reporting of screen failure subjects to meet the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) publishing requirements and to respond to queries from r egulatory 
authoritie s. Minimal information includes demography, screen failure details, eligibility criteria, 
and any serious adverse events (SAE)  related to protocol required procedures . Retesting of 
individual laboratory parameters to determine eli gibility is permitted if the values are: 
• Not consistent with life or the subject ’s current medical status . 
• Aberrant due to a spoiled sample. e.g., hemolyzed hematology sample. 
Individuals who do not meet the criteria for participation in this study (screen failure) may  be 
rescreened , if their medical status changes and they subsequently qualify for the study or there is 
an amendment to the protocol which allows participation . Rescreened subjects should not be 
assigned the same subject  number as for the initial screening . 
Screen failures may be rescreened only once, after approval from the s ponsor. If rescreening is 
less than 2 8 days prior to first study drug administration (Cycle 1, Day 1), the following 
assessments may be used for rescreening:  
• Previously submitted CT and MRI scans with acquisition date ≤28 days prior to Cycle 1 Day 1. Scans that exceed the 2 8-day window may be used for enrollment with sponsor 
approval. 
• Previously submitted tumor biopsy sample  
• Screening laboratory assessments that meet protocol- defined timeline s as indicated in 
Table 3  
Mereo Biopharma 5 , Inc . Etigilimab  
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 29 of 110 If rescreening is more than 2 8 days after the initial screen failure, the subject must be re-
consented, and all eligibility criteria must be re -assessed with repeat screening assessments as 
per protocol specified guidelines with the following exceptions: 
• Scans that exceed the 28 -day window may be used for enrollment with sponsor approval. 
• Previously submitted tumor biopsy sample  
4. TREATMENT S 
Study treatment is defined as an y investigational treatment(s), marketed product(s), placebo , or 
medical device(s)  intended to be administered to a study subject  according to the study protocol. 
4.1. Treatment s Administered  
Study Treatment Name:  Etigilimab Nivolumab 
Dosage formulation:  mg/mL in a -mL single -use glass 
vial filled to  mL to deliver a total of 
 mg per vial  40 mg/4 mL (10 mg/mL), 100 mg/10 
mL (10 mg/mL), or 240 mg (24 mL) 
solution  in a single -use vial  
Unit dose strength(s)  
/Dosage level(s):  mg if subject is ≥50 kg 
 mg/kg if subject is <50 kg  240 mg  
Route of Administration : IV IV 
Dosing instructions:  The initial dose of etigilimab will be delivered  on Day 1 over 90 ± 10 minutes  
followed by a 90-minute observation period. If the 90 -minute infusion is 
tolerated without infusion-associated adverse events, the second infusion may be delivered over 60 ± 10 minutes  
followed by a 60-minute observation period.  If the 60 -minute infusion is well 
tolerated, all subsequent infusions may be delivered over 30 ± 10 minutes  
followed by a 30-minute observation period per investigator ’s discretion . 
Etigilimab will be delivered prior to 
nivol umab . The etigilimab observation 
period will need to be completed before 
dosing nivolumab. If the subject is <50 
kg, the dose will be based on the 
subject ’s weight at each treatment visit.  Vials will be  diluted with 0.9% 
sodium chloride injection, USP or 5% dextrose injection, USP prior to use. It is administered over 30 + 
10 minutes (never <30 minutes) 
through an intravenous line containing as sterile, non -pyrogenic, 
low protein binding in-line filter (pore size of 0.2 micrometer to 1.2 
micrometer).  The initial dose of 
nivolumab will be delivered on 
Day 3. 
Packaging and Labeling : Study Treatment will be provided as 10  
vials in a carton.  Each vial and carton  
will be labeled as required per country requirement.  Commercial stock will be utilized. 

Mereo Biopharma 5 , Inc . Etigilimab  
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 30 of 110 4.2. Treatment Discontinuation  
Treatment discontinuation occurs when a subject  is no longer receiving study drug(s).  
Note that treatment discontinuation is not the same as study withdrawal. A subject should be 
discontinued from study treatment if, in the opinion of the i nvestigator , it is medically necessary, 
or if it is the wish of the subject . All subjects who discontinue study treatment should enter safety 
follow -up followed by survival follow- up; if a subject  discontinues study treatment prior to 
confirmed progression of disease, th e subject will continue to be followed for disease 
progression as per the planned study visits and procedures.  
Subjects will be discontinued from study treatment for any the following reasons: 
• An AE that requires permanent discontinuation of study drug(s). 
• Confirmed progression of disease (Note: subject s may continue treatment beyond 
RECIST v1.1 determined PD). 
• Noncompliance with protocol. 
• Investigator decision. 
• Subject becomes  pregnant. 
• Subject death . 
• Subject lost to  follow -up. 
• Termination of the study by the sponsor. 
• Voluntary withdrawal from the study treatment by the subject. 
4.3. Method of Treatment Assignment  
Upon enrollment, subjects will be assigned a unique number in ascending numerical.  
4.4. Preparation/Handling/Storage/Accounta bility  
1. The investigator or designee must confirm appropriate temperature conditions have been 
maintained during transit for all study treatment received and any discrepancies are reported and resolved before use of the study treatment. 
2. Store etigilimab and  nivolumab under refrigeration at 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F). Protect 
nivolumab from light by storing in the original package until time of use. Do not freeze or shake.  
3. The diluted etigilimab solution may be stored for no more than 8 hours at room temperature or  at 2°C- 8°C  for up to 48 hours. 
4. Only subject s enrolled in the study may receive study treatment and only authorized site 
staff may supply or administer study treatment. All study treatments must be stored in a secure, environmentally controlled, and monitored (manual or automated) area in accordance with the labeled storage conditions with access limited to the investigator and authorized site staff.  
5. Any unused portion left in a vial may not be used for another subject, as the product contains no pre servative (ie, they are single -use vials).  
Mereo Biopharma 5 , Inc . Etigilimab  
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 31 of 110 6. The investigator, institution, or the head of the medical institution (where applicable) is 
responsible for study treatment accountability, reconciliation, and record maintenance (ie, receipt, reconciliation, and final disposition records).  
7. Further guidance and information for the final disposition of unused study treatment are provided in the Pharmacy Manual .  
4.5. Treatment Compliance  
Etigilimab and nivolumab are administered IV by study site personnel. Thus, compliance with each infusion will be documented in the subject’s medical records and then recorded on the appropriate electronic case report form (eCRF) screen. In addition, drug accountability and PK monitoring will be done. 
4.6. Permitted Concomi tant Therapy or Standard of Care Treatment  
Investigators may prescribe concomitant medications deemed necessary to provide adequate supportive care except those identified as prohibited (refer to Section 3.3 ). Standard supportive 
medications may be used in accordance with institutional guidelines and investigator discretion. These may include hematopoietic growth factors to treat neutropenia or th rombocytopenia in 
accordance with American Society for Clinical Oncology guidelines (but not for prophylaxis in Cycle 1), packed RBC and platelet transfusions, and anti- emetics and antidiarrheals.  
Palliative surgical resection and palliative radiotherapy to specific sites of disease is permitted if 
considered medically necessary by the treating physician provided that: 
• Subjects are otherwise deriving benefit (i.e., subject does not have progressive disease).  
• Target lesions being used to measure response ar e not irradiated without discussion with 
the Medical Monitor. Irradiated lesions will be considered not evaluable for response but still can be used to assess disease progression. The intensities, number, and dates of doses received for allowed palliative radiotherapy should be recorded on the appropriate eCRF. 
Because COVID- 19 vaccine response and safety  may have the potential to be affected by 
administration of a particular investigational product (IP), a decision to vaccinate individuals with approved COVID-19 vaccines while on treatment with study drug is up to the individual and the treating physician. When feasible, the full vaccination series should be completed prior to enrollment when a delay in enrollment would not put the study participant at risk . Because 
potential AE s related to vaccine administration may confound study treatment infusion reactions, 
overlap of administration  should be avoided (with study drug and vaccine dosing at least 7 days 
apart)   
The administration of all other vaccines ( with the exception of live, attenuated vaccines)  is 
allowed on study as per institutional or standard of care  guidelines.  Note: vaccines should be 
administered within 2 days before or after study drug  administration .  
Mereo Biopharma 5 , Inc . Etigilimab  
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 32 of 110 Any medication or vaccine (including over- the-counter or prescription medicines, vitamins, 
and/or herbal supplements) that the subject is receiving at the time of enrollment through 90 days 
after treatment termination  must be recorded on the Concomitant Medications eCRF along with: 
• Reason for use. 
• Dates of administration including start and end dates . 
• Dosage information including dose and frequency. 
• Appropriate information to assess any potential vaccine - related AEs . 
Subjects who experience infusion- associated symptoms may be treated symptomatically with 
acetaminophen, ibuprofen, diphenhydramine, and/or cimetidine or another H2 receptor 
antagonist, as per standard practice (for sites outside the U.S., equivalent medications may be substituted per local practice). Serious infusion -associated events manifested by dyspnea, 
hypotension, wheezing, bronchospasm, tachycardia, reduced oxygen saturation, or respiratory distress should be managed with supportive therapies as clinically indicated (e.g., supplemental 
oxygen and β2- adrenergic agonists). Premedication may be administered for Cycles ≥2 at the 
discretion of the treating physician after consultation with the Medical Monitor.  
Subjects are permitted the use of topical, ocular, intra- articular, intranasal, and inhalational 
corticosteroids (with minimal systemic absorption). Adrenal replacement steroid doses >10 mg 
daily prednisone are permitted. A brief (single dose up to less than 3 weeks) course of corticosteroids for prophylaxis (e.g., contrast dye allergy) or for treatment of non -autoimmune 
conditions (e.g., delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction caused by a contact allergen) is permitted. Systemic corticosteroids >1 0 mg daily, TNFα antagonists , and other 
immunosuppressive agents may attenuate potential beneficial immunologic effects of treatment with etigilimab and nivolumab but  may be administered at the discretion of the treating physician 
in an emergency or after consultation with the Medical Monitor. If feasible, alternatives to corticosteroids should be considered. The use of inhaled corticosteroids and mineralocorticoids (eg, fludrocortisone for subjects with orthostatic hypotension or adrenocortical insufficien cy) is 
allowed. Physiologic doses of corticosteroids for adrenal insufficiency are allowed. Megestrol administered as an appetite stimulant is also permitted.   
Subjects who use oral contraceptives, hormone- replacement therapy, prophylactic or therapeutic 
anticoagulation therapy (such as low molecular weight heparin or warfarin at a stable dose level), 
or other maintenance therapy for non-malignant indications should continue their use.  
The Medical Monitor should be contacted if there are any questions rega rding concomitant or 
prior therapy.

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 33 of 110 5. DISCONTINUATION, DOSE HOLD, AND RES UMPTION  
Subjects will be monitored continuously for toxicity while on study treatment. Toxicity will be 
assessed using the NCI CTCAE version 5.0 or higher. 
If a subject  has an AE related to etigilimab and/ or nivolumab then dose interruptions/holds may 
occur as described  below.  
5.1. Etigilimab Dose Holds  and Discontinuation  
Permanent  D iscontinuation Criteria for Etigilimab  
Dosing with etigilimab should be permanently discontinued for the following toxicities : 
• ≥Grade 4 neutropenia persisting for ≥7 days and/or complicated by infection f ebrile 
neutropenia. 
• ≥Grade 4 thrombocytopenia . 
• Grade 3 drug-related thrombocytopenia >7 days or associated with clinically significant 
bleeding requires  discontinuation. 
• Any ≥Grade 3 non-hematologic toxicity, except: 
o Grade 3 fatigue lasting <7 days. 
o Grade 3 nausea, emesis, or diarrhea responding to supportive treatment within 5 days. 
• Grade 3 drug- related AE of the  skin requires dose discontinuation. 
• ≥ Grade 3 non -hematological laboratory abnormalities do not require treatment 
discontinuation except: 
o Grade ≥3 AST, ALT, total bilirubin require s dose discontinuation  
o Concurrent AST or ALT >3 x ULN and total bilirubin >2 x ULN require s 
permanent dose discontinuation.  
Note: I n most cases of Grade 3 AST or ALT elevation, study treatment will be 
permanently discontinued. If the i nvestigator determines a possible favorable  
benefit/risk ratio that warrants continuation of study treatment,  a discussion between 
the investigator and the Medical Monitor or designee must occur. o Isolated Grade 4 electrolyte imbalances/abnormalities that are not associated with clinical sequelae and are corrected with supplementation/appropriate management 
within 72 hours of their onset. 
Etigilimab  may be held/ delayed  due to toxicity. The dose level of etigilimab  will not be modified 
for individual subjects in this study.  
Mereo Biopharma 5 , Inc . Etigilimab  
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 34 of 110 Dose Delay Crit eria for E tigilimab  
• Grade 2 non-skin, drug-related AE, except for fatigue. 
• Grade 2 drug- related creatinine, AST, ALT , and/or total bilirubin abnormalities.  
• Grade 3 skin drug- related AE . 
• Grade 3 drug- related laboratory abnormality with the following except ions: 
o Grade 3 lymphopenia or asymptomatic amylase or lipase does not require a dose 
delay . 
• Any AE, laboratory abnormality or inter- current illness which, in the judgment of the 
investigator, warrants delaying the dose of study medication. 
The maximum duration of a dose hold is 28-days, unless a longer hold is approved by the Medical M onitor or designee; thereafter, the subject  should be discontinued from etigilimab 
treatment. E tigilimab infusions may be delayed to allow subject s to recover from study treatment 
related AEs or intercurrent illness. Subjects who require delay of etigilimab  should be re-
evaluated weekly or more frequently if clinically indicated and resume etigilima b dosing when 
re-treatment criteria are met (see below)  following discussion with the Medical Monitor. 
Individual subject cases should be discussed with the Sponsor Medical Monitor or designee for 
individual treatment decisions. 
Dosing visits are not skipped, only delayed. Tumor assessments should continue as per protocol 
even if dosing is delayed.  
Criteria to Resume E
 tigilimab  Dosing  
• Subject s will be permitted to resume etigilimab  therapy following resolution of the AE to  
≤Grade 1 or to baseline value, with the following exceptions.  
• Subject s may resume treat ment in the presence of Grade 2  fatigue. 
• Subjects who have not experienced a Grade 3 drug- related skin AE may resume 
treatment in the presence of Grade 2 skin toxicity . 
• For subjects with Grade 2 AST, ALT , and/or total bilirubin abnormalities, dosing may 
resume when laboratory values return to baseline and management with corticosteroids, if 
needed, is complete  (See Appendix 8). 
• Drug -related pulmonary toxicity, diarrhea, or colitis must have resolved to baseline 
before treatment is resumed. Subjects with persistent Grade 1 pneumonitis after 
completion of a  steroid taper over at least 1 month may be eligible for retreatment if 
discussed with and approved by the Medical Monitor or designee. 
• Subjects with drug-related endocrinopathies adequately controlled with only physiologic hormone replacement may resume t reatment after consultation with the Medical Monitor 
or designee. Adrenal insufficiency requires discontinuation regardless of control with hormone replacement. 
Subjects who meet criteria for permanent discontinuation must not receive further study therapy .

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 35 of 110 5.2. Nivolumab Dose Hold , Resumption  and Discontinuation  
Nivolumab may be held/interrupted due to toxicity. The dose level of nivolumab will not be 
modified in this study. Repeat nivolumab infusions may be delayed to allow subject s to recover 
from study treatment related AEs or intercurrent illness. Dosing visit s are not skipped, only 
delayed. Tumor assessments should continue as per protocol even if dosing is delayed. 
A pattern of immune -related AEs has been defined for nivolumab treatment for which 
management algorithms have been developed ( OPDIVO 2018 ). Most high - grade events were 
manageable with dose delays and the use of corticosteroids or hormone replacement  therapy 
(endocrinopathies) as instructed in these algorithms.  
Details on dose delays, re-initiation of treatment and discontinuation of nivolumab are provided 
below. 
Dose Delay Criteria for Nivolumab  
Nivolumab administration should be delayed for the following:  
• Grade 2 non-skin, drug-related AE, except for fatigue. 
• Grade 2 drug- related creatinine, AST, ALT and/or total bilirubin abnormalities .  
• Grade 3 skin drug- related AE . 
• Grade 3 drug- related laboratory abnormality with the following exceptions: 
o Grade 3 lymphopenia or asymptomatic amylase or lipase does not requir e a dose 
delay . 
o Grade ≥3 AST, ALT, total bilirubin required dose discontinuation (see below). 
• Any AE, laboratory abnormality or inter- current illness which, in the judgment of the 
investigator, warrants delaying the dose of study medication. 
Subjects who r equire delay of nivolumab should be re- evaluated weekly or more frequently if 
clinically indicated and resume nivolumab dosing when re- treatment criteria are met (see below).  
If the decision is to resume nivolumab dosing, the subject should restart treatme nt on the next 
regularly scheduled dosing visit. Skipped doses are not to be replaced. If treatment is delayed 
>8 weeks, the subject may potentially be permanently discontinued from all study therapy, except as specified in the t reatment discontinuation c riteria below. Individual subject  cases 
should be discussed with the Medical Monitor or designee for individual treatment decisions.  
Criteria to Resume Nivolumab Dosing  
Subject s will be permitted to resume nivolumab therapy following resolution of the AE to  
≤Grade 1 or to baseline value, with the following exceptions :  
• Subject s may resume treatment in the presence of Grade 2  fatigue. 
• Subjects who have not experienced a Grade 3 drug- related skin AE may resume 
treatment in the presence of Grade 2 skin toxici ty. 
Mereo Biopharma 5 , Inc . Etigilimab  
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 36 of 110 • For subjects with Grade 2 AST, ALT , and/or total bilirubin abnormalities, dosing may 
resume when laboratory values return to baseline and management with corticosteroids, if 
needed, is complete.  
• Drug -related pulmonary toxicity, diarrhea or colitis must have resolved to baseline before 
treatment is resumed. Subjects with persistent Grade 1 pneumonitis after completion of a 
steroid taper over at least 1 month may be eligible for retreatment if discussed with and approved by the Medical Monitor or designee. 
• Subjects with drug-related endocrinopathies adequately controlled with only physiologic hormone replacement may resume treatment after consultation with the Medical Monitor or designee. Adrenal insufficiency requires discontinuation regardless of control with hormone replacement. 
• Subject s who meet criteria for permanent discontinuation must not receive further study  
therapy. 
Permanent Treatment Discontinuation Criteria for Nivolumab  
Subject s meeting any of the following criteria will be required to perman ently discontinue 
nivolumab: 
• Any Grade 2 drug-related uveitis or eye pain or blurred vision that does not respond to topical therapy and does not improve to Grade 1 severity within 8 weeks OR requires systemic treatment . 
• Any Grade 3 non- skin, drug- related AE lasting >7 days or recurs, with the following 
exceptions for laboratory abnormalities, drug- related uveitis, pneumonitis, 
bronchospasm, neurologic toxicity, hypersensitivity reactions, infusion reactions, and endocrinopathies: 
o Grade 3 drug- related uveit is, pneumonitis, bronchospasm, neurologic toxicity, 
myocarditis, hypersensitivity reaction, or infusion reaction of any duration  
requires discontinuation. 
o Grade 3 drug-related endocrinopathies adequately controlled with only physiologic hormone replacement do not require discontinuation. Adrenal insufficiency requires discontinuation regardless of control with hormone replacement. 
• Grade 3 drug- related laboratory abnormalities do not require treatment discontinuation 
except:

significant bleeding requires  discontinuation. 
o Grade ≥3 drug- related AST, ALT, or total bilirubin requires  discontinuation. 
o Concurrent AST or ALT >3 ×  ULN and total bilirubin >2 ×  ULN. 
o In most cases of Grade 3 AST or ALT elevation, study treatment will be permanently discontinued. If the investigator determines a possible favorable benefit/risk ratio that warrants continuation of study treatment,  a discussion between 
the investigator and the Medical Monitor or designee must occur. 
Mereo Biopharma 5 , Inc . Etigilimab  
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 37 of 110 • Any Grade 4 drug- related AE or laboratory abnormality (including but not limited to 
creatinine, AST, ALT, or total bilirubin), except for the following events, which do not 
require discontinuation: 
o Grade 4 neutropenia ≤7 days . 
o Grade 4 lymphopenia or leukopenia or asymptomatic amylase or lipase. 
o Isolated Grade 4 electrolyte imbalances/abnormalities that are not associated with clinical sequelae and are corrected with supplementation/appropriate management within 72 hours of their onset. 
o Grade 4 drug-related endocrinopathy AEs such as hyper- or hypothyroidism, or glucose intolerance, which resolve or are adequately controlled with physiologic hormone replacement (corticosteroids, thyroid hormones) or glucose- controlling 
agents, respectively, may not require discontinuation after discussion with and approval from the Medical Monitor or designee. 
• Any AE, laboratory abnormality, or intercurrent illness, which, in the judgment of the investigator , presents a substan tial clinical risk to the subject  with continued treatment. 
Criteria for Further Discussion with Medical Monitor or Designee Before Deciding to  
 Continue 
or Discontinue Nivolumab Treatment 
For subject s meeting any of the following criteria, discussion with the Medical Monitor or 
designee is to occur to determine whether treatment should continue. Any dosing interruption of nivolumab lasting >8 weeks after the last  dose. Dosing interruptions to allow for prolonged 
steroid tapers to manage drug - related AEs ar e allowed. Prior to re- initiating treatment in a 
subject with a dosing interruption lasting >8 weeks after the last dose and with no more than 2 missed doses, the Medical Monitor or designee must be consulted. Tumor assessments should continue as per protocol even if dosing is interrupted.  
5.3. Dosing I nterruptions   
Dose  interruptions >8 weeks after the last dose, which occur for non- drug related reasons, may 
be allowed if approved by the Medical Monitor or designee. Prior to re- initiating treatment in a 
subject  with a dosing interruption lasting >8 weeks after the last dose and with no more than 
2 missed doses, the Medical Monitor or designee must be consulted. Tumor assessments should continue as per protocol even if dosing is interrupted, and subject s mus t otherwise meet the 
criteria for continued treatment at the time re -initiation of study therapy is  considered. 
5.4. Toxicity Management Guidelines for Specific Adverse Events  
Because of the potential for clinically meaningful immune- related AEs  requiring early 
recognition and prompt intervention, established management algorithms are recommended  for 
suspected pulmonary toxicity, gastrointestinal ( GI) toxicity, hepatotoxicity, endocrinopathy, skin 
toxicity, neurological toxicity, and renal toxicity. 
These AE  management algorithms are included in Appendix 8.

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 38 of 110 6. RESPONSE  ASSESSMENTS 
6.1. Radiographic Evaluations and Confirmation of Disease  Progression  
Response and progression will be determined by i nvestigator assessment of on- trial radiographic 
evaluations, that will be conducted every 8 (±1) weeks through Week 48 and then at least every 
12 (±1) weeks until confirmed progression of disease (as defined below), alternate anticancer 
therapy, withdrawal of consent, or death, whichever occurs first. The radiographic assessments are to be conducted as noted, independent of dose delays and/or dose interruptions. RECIST 1.1 criteria will be used for  primary endpoint evaluation ( Eisenhauer et al., 2009), iRECIST  will be 
used for exploratory endpoint response evaluation ( Seymour et al., 2017 ). 
Radiographic evaluation may be done using either CT or MRI, but the modality chosen to evaluate each individual subject should be the same as the screening evaluation throughout the 
duration of the study. 
Under specific circumstances subjects who develop PD per RECIST v1.1 may continue 
treatment and be followed for improved response or confirmed progression of disease [treatment 
beyond progression ( Section 6.2)] . Regardless of whether or not a subject  continues treatment in 
the eve nt of RECIST -determined PD, follow- up radiographic assessments to confirm progression 
or show improvement in response are to be conducted at least 4 weeks after the assessment of PD per RECIST v1.1 (unless there is prior clinical deterioration, initiation of other cancer therapy, or withdrawal of consent).  
For subjects who continue treatment beyond progression ( Section 6.2),  iRECIST  PD should be 
confirmed at least 4  to 8 weeks after the first radiologic evidence of PD in clinically stable 
participants.  
Subjects who have unconfirmed PD (iUPD) may continue study treatment until progression is 
confirmed as long as the subject is clinica lly stable and has provided written informed consent 
prior to receiving additional treatment (Section 6.2 ). Clinically unstable subjects should be 
discontinued from s tudy treatment at the first occurrence of radiographic PD (iUPD) and are not 
required to have repeat imaging to confirm PD by iRECIST (though a confirmation of progression scan may be obtained at the investigator’s discretion after consultation with the sponsor). 
If repeat imaging shows iRECIST confirmed disease progression (iCPD), subjects will discontinue treatment. However, if the subject is deriving benefit after iCPD  is observed, an 
exception to continue study treatment must be approved by the sponsor’s Medical Monitor. 
Subjects who have repeat imaging to confirm progression are not required to undergo the next scheduled tumor imaging if it is less than 4 weeks later.  
If repeat imaging shows iRECIST stable disease (iSD), iRECIST partial response (iPR), or iRECIST complete response (iCR), imaging should be continued every 8 (± 1) weeks and the 
subject should continue on trial treatment.  
Mereo Biopharma 5 , Inc . Etigilimab  
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 39 of 110 Note that the date of progression  to be used for all relevant efficacy endpoints will be based on 
first documentation of PD (ie , RECIST v1.1 date of PD), regardless of date of confirmation of 
PD for subjects who continue on treatment. 
All radiographic evaluations performed on the study wi ll be collected and held for a potential 
independent review. Details regarding initiating an independent review will be outlined in the 
statistical analysis plan (SAP).  
Confirmed progression of disease i s defined as one of the following:  
Clinical deteriora tion with or without radiographic PD per RECIST v1.1 ( See Appendix 7) will  
confirm progression of disease. Note, however, that radiographic evaluation should be conducted at the time of clinical signs and/or symptoms of PD whenever possible.  
• In subjects without clinical deterioration at the time of a radiographic scan showing PD per RECIST v1.1, a second scan conducted at least 4 weeks later showing progression of disease as outlined below will confirm progression:  
• An additional 10% increase in tumor burden with a minimum 5 mm absolute increase from time of initial PD. This includes an increase in the sum of diameters of all target lesions and/ or the diameters of new measurable lesions compared to the time of initial PD. 
• New lesions are considered measurable at the time of initial progression if the longest 
diameter is at least 1 0 mm (except for pathological lymph nodes which must have a short 
axis of at least  15 mm). Any new lesion considered non- measurable at the time of initial 
progression may become measurable and therefore included in the tumor burden if the 
longest diameter increases to at least 10 mm (except for pathological lymph nodes which must have a short axis of at least 15 mm). In situations where the relative increase in  total 
tumor burden by 10% is solely due to inclusion of new lesions which become measurable, these new lesions must demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5  mm. 
Subjects should discontinue study therapy upon evidence of confirmed progression. Subject s 
who discontinue study treatment prior to confirmed progression of disease will continue to unde rgo radiographic and response assessments per protocol.  
Note that all radiographic scans will be collected and archived for potential independent central review of response.  
6.2. Treatment Beyond Progression  
Accumulating evidence indicates that a minority of subject s with solid tumors treated with 
immunotherapy may derive clinical benefit despite initial evidence of radiographic PD. Following approval of the medical monitor or designee and consent of the subject for continued treatment beyond initial RECIST v1. 1-defined PD, subject s who meet the following criteria will 
be permitted to continue on their treatment: 
• Investigator- assessed clinical benefit and without rapid disease progression; Subject 
continues to meet all other study protocol eligibility criteria . 
• Subject tolerates study drug. 
Mereo Biopharma 5 , Inc . Etigilimab  
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 40 of 110 • Subject has stable ECOG performance status. 
• Treatment beyond progression will not delay an imminent intervention to prevent serious 
complications of disease progression (eg, CNS metastases) . 
The assessment of clinical benefit should take into account whether the subject  is clinically 
deteriorating and unlikely to receive further benefit from continued treatment. All decisions to 
continue treatment beyond initial RECIST v1.1 PD must be discussed with the Medical Monitor or designee, and an assessment of the risk/benefit of continuing with study therapy must be documented in the study records. 
Subjects should continue to attend study visits and undergo monitoring according to the 
protocol-defined on- treatment assessments. Radiographic assessment is required when subject s 
continue treatment after RECIST v1.1 determined PD.  
6.3. Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid  Tumors  
Assessment of response and progression status in all subject s will be evaluated using the 
definitions from RECIST v1.1 for clinical decision -making and assessment of endpoints. 
Evaluation for target, non-target, and new lesions based on RECIST v1.1 are to be considered. 
For a best overall response of CR or PR, confirmation of the response is required at a subsequent 
timepoint at least 4 weeks after the initial observation. Confirmed CR or PR will be claimed only if the criteria for each are met at that subsequent timepoin t as outlined in  Appendix 7.

a If a CR is truly met at the first timepoint, then any disease seen at a subsequent timepoint, even 
disease meeting PR criteria relative to baseline, makes the disease PD at that point (since disease 
must have reappeared after CR). Best re sponse would depend on whether minimum duration for SD 
was met. However, CR may be claimed when subsequent scans suggest small lesions were likely still 
present and in fact the subject had PR, not CR at the first timepoint. Under these circumstances, the original CR should be changed to PR and the best response is PR.  
b Minimum required duration of SD is 6 weeks.

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 42 of 110 7. PERMANENT AND TEMPORARY DISCONTINUATION 
CRITERIA  
In the absence of unacceptable toxicities or disease progression, subjects will be offered continued study treatment up until disease progression . Regardless of discontinuation of study 
drug, subjects should continue on study with regular follow-up. All subjects who have discontinued etigilimab and nivolumab will return to the clinic for a treatment termination visit within 30 days after the last dose of etigilimab study treatment or nivolumab , whichever occurs 
last).  
Subjects may withdraw or be withdrawn from the study at any time.  
Subjects will be withdrawn from the study treatment for the following reasons:  
• Clinically significant disease progression, as assessed by the investigator.  
• Intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment.  
• Unacceptable AE s. 
• Dose delay due to drug- related toxicity >28 days.  
• Non-protocol anti- cancer therapy.  
• Subject decides to withdraw from the study.  
• General or specific changes in the subject's condition render further treatment 
unacceptable for the subject i n the judgment of the investigator.  
• Protocol non- compliance.  
In the absence of progressive disease and additional anti -cancer therapy, all attempts should be 
made to continue tumor assessments per RECIST criteria until disease progression or initiation 
of subsequent anti-cancer therapy for up to 2 years. 
All subjects will undergo the treatment termination evaluations.  
7.1. Lost to Follow Up 
A subject  will be considered lost to follow -up if he or she repeatedly fails to return for scheduled 
visits and is unable to be contacted by the study site.  
The following actions must be taken if a subject  fails to return to the clinic for a required study 
visit:  
• The site must attempt to contact the subject and reschedule the missed visit as soon as 
possible and couns el the subject on the importance of maintaining the assigned visit 
schedule and ascertain whether or not the subject  wishes to and/or should continue in the 
study. 
Mereo Biopharma 5 , Inc . Etigilimab  
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 43 of 110 • In cases in which the subject  is deemed lost to follow up, the investigator or designee 
must make every effort to regain contact with the subject (where possible, 3 telephone 
calls and , if necessary , a certified letter to the subject’s last known mailing address or 
local equivalent methods). These contact attempts should be documented in the subj ect’s 
medical record . 
• Should the subject continue to be unreachable, he/she will be considered to have 
withdrawn from the study with a primary reason of lost to follow -up.  
8. STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES  
• Study procedures and their timing are summarized in the SoA.  
• As protocol waivers or exemptions are not allowed with the exception of immediate safety 
concerns, these should be discussed with the sponsor immediately upon occurrence or 
awareness to determine if the subject  should continue or discontinue study treatment. 
• Adherence to the study design requirements, including those specified in the SoA, is essential 
and required for study conduct. 
• All screening evaluations must be completed and reviewed to confirm that potential subject s 
meet all eligibility criteria. The investigator will maintain a screening log to record details of all subject s screened and to confirm eligibility or record reasons for screening failure, as 
applicable.  
• Once the screening process has been completed, the i nvestigator must submit a completed 
enrollment form to the sponsor for approval. Once the investigator has received the signed and dated form back from the sponsor, the subject is considered to be enrolled in the study. 
• Procedures conducted as part of the subject ’s routine clinical management (eg, blood count) 
and obtained before signing of ICF  may be utilized for screening or baseline purposes 
provided the procedure met the protocol- specified  criteria and were  performed within the 
time frame
 defined in the SoA

Notes to Schedule of Assessments  
a. Written informed consent is required before performing any study- specific tests or procedures and may be obtained at any time prior to such tests or 
procedures. Results of standard -of-care tests or examinations performed prior to obtaining informed consent and within 28 days prior to Cycle 1 Day 1 may 
be used for screening assessments rather than repeating such tests. Results for the following laboratory tests mus t be obtained within 14 days prior to Cycle 1 
Day 1: hematology, serum  or plasma  chemistry and coagulation panel.  
b. Medical and surgical histories are required. Cancer history includes stage, date of diagnosis, and prior anti- cancer therapy. Demographic info rmation 
includes sex, age, and self -reported race/ethnicity.  
c. Screening and subsequent tumor assessments must include CT scans (with IV contrast unless contraindicated and oral contrast a s appropriate per 
institutional standards) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis. If a CT scan for tumor assessment is performed in a positron emission tomography (PET)/CT 
scanner, the CT acquisition must be consistent with the standards for a full -contrast CT scan. Brain imaging (either MRI or contrast -enhanced CT) is 
required at screening for all subjects. Further investigations such as bone scans and CT scans of the neck should also be performed if  there is any clinical 
suspicion of disease at any site that may not be demonstrated by the minimum schedule of assessments listed above. At the investigator’s discretion, other methods of assessment of measurable disease as per RECIST  v1.1 may be used.  
The same radiographic procedures used to assess disease sites at screening should be used throughout the study (eg, the same contrast  protocol for CT 
scans). Response will be assessed by the investigator on the basis of physical examinations and the imaging modalities detail ed above, using RECIST 
criteria. Assessments should be performed by the same evaluator if possible to ensure internal consistency across visits.  
Mereo Biopharma 5 , Inc . Etigilimab  
CONFIDENTIAL     Page 47 of 110 Tumor assessments will be performed every 8 weeks  (±1) from Cycle 1 Day 1 or as clinically indicated  through to week 48 and then at least every 12 (±1 ) 
weeks . Response assessment data (i .e., progressive disease or no progress ion of disease) will continue to be collected (based on standard -of-care 
radiographs) for subjects who have not progressed at the time of the termination visit. until the subject starts alternative anti-cancer treatment or develops 
progressive disease, whichever occurs first. Response assessment and assessment of tumor markers will be obtained at treatment termination, unless a prior 
radiographic assessment has been performed within the last 14 days or at a prior response assessment that documented progress ive disease. At the 
investigator’s discretion, scans may be performed at any time if progressive disease is suspected.  
d. Concomitant medications include any prescription medications or over -the-counter medications. At subsequent visits, changes to current me dications, or 
medications used since the last documentation of medications will be recorded.  
e. Vital signs include heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure and temperature. For the first etigilimab infusion, measure vital signs within 60 minutes before 
infusion, every 15 ( ±5 minutes) during the infusion and 30 ( ±10 minutes ) and 90 ( ±15) minutes after the end of the infusion. For subsequent  etigilimab  
infusions, measure vital signs within 60 minutes before infusion, during infusion if clinically indicated and 30 ( ±10) minutes after the end of the etigilimab 
infusion. Vital signs during and after nivolumab  infusion are per institutional guidelines.  
f. A co mplete physical examination will be done at baseline. At all other study visits a symptom -directed physical examination must be performed focusing on 
the subject ’s signs  and symptoms. A more complete physical examination should be conducted when clinically indicated.  
g. The etigilimab  dose should be based on the Cycle 1 Day 1 weight throughout the study, unless the weight changes by >10%.  
h. A 12-lead ECG will be obtained during screening, 30 (+30  minutes) after infusion of etigilimab  on Cycle 1 Day 1, and 30 (+30 minutes) after infusion of 
etigilimab  on Cycle 4 Day 1 and at treatment termination. Subjects should be resting and in a supine or semi -recumbent position for at least 10 minutes prior 
to each ECG collection.  
i. Hematology can be performed within a -2- day window  of the visit  and consists of CBC, including RBC count, hemoglobin, hematocrit, WBC count with 
automated differential (neutrophils, lymphocytes, eosinophils, monocytes, basophils,), and platelet count. A manual different ial can be done if clinically 
indicated. During screening, hematology results must be obtained within 14 days prior to Cycle 1, Day 1.  If screening laboratory results available within 
72 hours C1D1 laboratory tests do not need to be repeated.  
j. Serum or plasma chemistry can b e performed within a -2 day window of the visit and includes BUN, creatinine, sodium, potassium, magnesium, chloride, 
bicarbonate, calcium, phosphorus, glucose, total bilirubin, direct bili rubin, ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase, lactate dehydrogenase, total protein, and 
albumin.  During screening, serum or plasma chemistry results must be obtained within 14 days prior to Cycle 1, Day 1.  If screening laboratory results 
available within 72 hours C1D1 laboratory tests do not need to be repeated.  
k. Etigilimab  must  be dosed as described in the Protocol . Dosing of etigilimab  should be  within  ± 2 days  of the Study Day listed in  the schedule  of assessments. 
If etigilimab cannot be administered in this 2 -day window, then that dose is considered missed.  If treatment  with etigilimab is delayed  for >4 weeks,  
etigilimab will be  permanently discontinued. 
l. Nivolumab must be dosed as described in the Protocol  within  ± 2 days of the Study  Day listed in  the schedule  of assessments . If the etigilimab dose is 
delayed ± 2 days  then the nivolumab dose would be delayed and administered on the same day as the etigilimab (except for C1D1 where etigilimab is 
administered without nivolumab).  
m. After initiation of study drug, report all adverse events until 90 days after the treatment termination visit.  
n. Thyroid function tests (TSH, free T3 , and free T4) must be performed every 8 weeks or as clinically indicated and at treatment termination . 
o. Urinalysis (specific gravity, pH, glucose, protein, ketones, and blood) will be obtained during screening, at Study Days 22, 64, and at the time of treatment 
termination . Microanalysis is required if protein or blood is detected.  
p. Serum pregnancy test (for women of childbearing potential, including women who have had a tubal ligation) must be performed and documented as negative 
within 7 days prior to Cycle 1, Day 1 and at treatment termination . 
q. Perform tests for pertinent tumor markers (e .g., CEA for subjec ts with colorectal cancer or others) every 4 weeks  or as needed  starting at Cycle1 Day1.  
r. PK and ADA samples will be drawn according to Table 3 listed  below.  
Mereo Biopharma 5 , Inc . Etigilimab  
CONFIDENTIAL     Page 48 of 110 s. A pre -dose sample of 33 mL will be drawn during screening and on Study Days, 1, 8, 22, and 36 and every 6 weeks after day 36 for subjects continuing on 
study drug to evaluate changes in plasma proteins (8 mL) by immunochemistry, TIGIT and imm une-related gene expression by mRNA (5 mL) and changes 
in peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC, 20 mL) populations and activation. A sample will also be collected at the time of  treatment termination, unless 
one has been obtained during the prior 14 days. Instructions for the collection, handling, storage, and shipment are provided in the Laboratory Manual .  
t. A 6 mL of blood will be collected for pharmacogenetic testing if the subject has consented to have this optional sample collected.  
u. For TMB -H/MSS  cohort, a 20 mL blood collection will occur during screening using the Guardant provided IUO kit. If collected in screening for TMB -
H/MSS  cohort, Study Day 1 collection does not need to occur. For all other cohorts, a 10 mL of plasma for cell -free tumor DNA assessment will be collected 
pre-dose on Study Days 1, 36, 78 , and at treatment termination.  As outlined in Section 3.1  TMB-H /MSS  (Cohort E) subjects with the following solid tumors 
will enroll into respective tumor specific cohorts after discussion with the sponsor:  Cohorts A, C, F and H. For these subjects, a 20 mL blood collectio n will  
still be required using the Guardent Health provided IUO kit.  
v. Archival FFPE is required for enrolment and must have been collected preferably within 6 months  but no longer than 1 year from  screening . If archival 
tumor tissue is not available  either fresh core or punch needle biopsy at study entry ( 3 fresh cores/punches preferred whenever possible) is required. Fine 
needle aspirate samples are not acceptable. Instructions for the collection, handling, storage, and shipment of these samples  are provided in the Laboratory 
Manual.  
. Pre-treatment Biopsy: Baseline fresh tumor tissue samples consisting of 3 core needle biopsies of deep tumor tissue or lymph nodes or excisional, 
incisional, punch, or forceps biopsies of cutaneous, subcutaneous, or mucosal lesions will be obtained for all  subjects . Subjects undergoing core needle 
biopsy should have accessible lesion(s) that permit a total of at least two biopsies (pretreatment and on -treatment) without unacceptable risk of major 
procedural complication  (one pretreatment and at least one on -treatment biopsy will be performed; minimum diameter, 18 gauge). If possible, at least 3 cores 
should be collected from each lesion.   
Optional On-treatment Biopsy  may be considered only in patients who provided fresh  baseline biopsy.  This subsequent fresh biopsy may be performed 
approximately 8 weeks  (within ± 5 days of Day 57)  following the first administration of etigilimab .  
An additional optional biopsy may be collected per investigator discretion, preferably at the time of radiographic progression or response. Requirements and 
procedures for pre -treatment and on -treatment biopsy collection are identical.   
For pre and on -treatment, 1 -2 cores will be fixed and shipped to central lab in ethanol and an additional 1 core will be fresh frozen as specified in the 
Laboratory Manual.  
w. At Cycle 7 and beyond . safety laboratory testing is completed every two weeks at each treatment visit only.   
x. The terminatio n visit should be done as soon as possible, but no later than 30 days, after one of the discontinuation criteria for the study are met (See 
Protocol). The termination visit may occur later after discussion with the Sponsor  Medical Monitor for specific circ umstances, such as prolonged 
hospitalization. The visit at which a tumor assessment shows progressive disease may be used as the treatment termination vis it provided that all required 
assessments were performed as outlined in the Schedule of Assessments . Tumor assessments do not have to be repeated if they were performed within 
14 days of the termination visit or at a prior response evaluation that documented progressive disease. ECG does not have to be repeated if they were 
performed within 14 days of the termination visit.

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 50 of 110 8.2. Efficacy Assessments  
Planned timepoints for all efficacy assessments are provided in the SoA.  
Screening and subsequent tumor assessments must include CT scans (with IV contrast unless 
contraindicated  and oral contrast as appropriate per institutional standards) of the head and 
neck, chest, abdomen, pelvis  and other site of disease for sarcoma as needed . If a CT scan for 
tumor assessment is performed in a positron emission tomography (PET)/ CT scanner, the CT 
acquisition must be consistent with the standards for a full -contrast CT scan. Brain imaging 
(either MRI or contrast -enhanced CT) is required at scr eening for all subjects. Further 
investigations such as bone scans and CT scans of the neck should also be performed if there is any clinical suspicion of disease at any site that may not be demonstrated by the minimum schedule of assessments listed above.  At the investigator’s discretion, other methods of 
assessment of measurable disease as per RECIST  v1.1 may be used. 
The same radiographic procedures used to assess disease sites at screening should be used 
throughout the study (eg, the same contrast proto col for CT scans). Response will be assessed 
by the investigator on the basis of physical examinations and the imaging modalities detailed above, using RECIST criteria. Assessments should be performed by the same evaluator , if 
possible, to ensure internal consistency across visits.  
Tumor assessments will be performed every 8 (±1) weeks from Cycle 1 Day 1 through Week 48 and then at least every 12 (±1) weeks or as clinically indicated until confirmed progression 
of disease (as defined below), alternate anticancer therapy, withdrawal of consent , or death, 
whichever occurs first. The radiographic assessments are to be conducted as noted, independent of dose delays and/or dose interruptions. RECIST 1.1 criteria will be used for primary endpoint evaluation ( Eisenhauer et al., 2009), iRECIST will be used for exploratory 
endpoint response evaluation ( Seymour et al., 2017).  
Response assessment data (ie, progressive disease or no progression of disease) will continue 
to be collected (based on standard -of-care radiographs) for subjects who have not progressed 
at the time of the termination visit. until the subject starts alternative anti -cancer treatment or 
develops progressive disease, whichever occurs first. Response assessment and assessment of 
tumor markers will be obtained at treatment termination, unless a prior radiographic assessment has been performed within the last 14 days or at a prior response assessment that documented progressive disease. At the investigator’s discretion, scans may be performed at any time if progressive disease is suspected.  
8.3. Safety   
Planned timepoints for all safety assessments are provided in the SoA . 
8.3.1. Adverse Events  
Measures will be taken to ensure the safety of subjects participating in this trial, including the use of stringent inclusion and exclusion criteria (see Section 3.1 and Section 3.2) and close monitoring. All subjects  will be monitored closely for toxicity. Administration of etigilimab 
and nivolumab will be performed in a setting with available emergency medical facilities with access to a critical care unit and staff who are trained to monitor for and respond to medic al emergencies.   
Mereo Biopharma 5 , Inc . Etigilimab  
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 51 of 110 The definitions of an AE or SAE can be found in Appendix 4. Management guidelines for 
specific AEs  can be found in Appendix 8. 
AE will be reported by the subject (or, when appropriate, by a caregiver, surrogate, or the subject’s legally  authorized representative ).  
The investigator and any designees are responsible for detecting, documenting, and reporting events that meet the definition of an AE  or SAE and remain responsible for following up AE 
that are serious,  considered related to the study treatment or the study, or that caused the 
subject to discontinue the study treatment.  
8.3.1.1 Time Period and Frequency for Collecting AE and SAE Information 
All AE s will be collected from the start of treatment with etigilimab until 90  days after the 
treatment termination  visit and at the timepoints specified in the SoA. SAEs will be collected 
starting  after signature of the informed consent until 90 days after the treatment termination 
visit.  
Medical occurrences that begin before the start of study treatment but after obtaining 
informed consent will be recorded on the Medical History/Current Medical Co nditions 
section of the case report form (CRF).  
All SAE s will be recorded and reported to the sponsor or designee within 24 hours, as 
indicated in Appendix 4. The  investigator will submit any updated SAE data to the sponsor 
within 24 hours of it being available. 
Investigators are not obligated to actively seek AE or SAE information in former study 
subjects. However, if the investigator learns of any SAE, including a death, at any time after a subject has been discharged from the study, and he/she considers the event to be reasonably related to the study treatment or study participation, the investigator must promptly notify the 
sponsor. 
The method of recording, evaluating, and assessing causality of AE and SAE and the 
procedures for completing and transmitting SAE reports are provided in Appendix 4. 
8.3.1.2 Method of Detecting AE and SAE  
Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting AE and/or SAE. Open-ended and non-leading verbal questioning of the subject is the preferred method to inquire about 
AE occurrence.  
8.3.1.3 Follow- up of AE and SAE  
After the initial AE/SAE report, th e investigator is required to proactively follow each subject 
at subsequent visits/contacts. All SAE s and immune- related  AEs  will be followed until 
resolution, stabilization, until the event is otherwise explained, or the subject  is lost to follow -
up (as defined in Section 7.1). Further information  on follow-up procedures is given in 
Appendix 4. 
Mereo Biopharma 5 , Inc . Etigilimab  
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 52 of 110 8.3.1.4 Regulatory Reporting Requirements for SAE  
• Prompt notification by the investigator to the sponsor of an  SAE is essential so that 
legal obligations and ethical responsibilities towards the safety of subjects and the 
safety of a study treatment under clinical investigation are met.  
• The sponsor has a legal responsibility to notify both the local regulatory authority and 
other regulatory agencies about the safety of a study treatment under clinical 
investigation. The sponsor will comply with country- specific regulatory requirements 
relating to safety reporting to the regulatory authority, IRB/IEC, and investiga tors. 
• Investigator safety reports must be prepared for suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions according to local regulatory requirements and sponsor policy and forwarded to investigators as necessary.  
• An investigator who receives an investigator sa fety report describing a n SAE or other 
specific safety information (eg, summary or listing of SAE) from the sponsor will file it along with the Investigator’s Brochure and will notify the IRB/IEC, if appropriate according to local requirements.  
8.3.2. Pregnancy  
• Details of all pregnancies in female subject s and, if indicated, female partners of male 
subject s will be collected after the start of study treatment and until the pregnancy 
outcome is known. 
• If a pregnancy is reported, the investigator should inform sponsor within 24 hours of 
learning of the pregnancy. 
• Abnormal pregnancy outcomes (eg, spontaneous abortion, fetal death, stillbirth, 
congenital anomalies, ectopic pregnancy) are considered SAEs. 
8.3.3. Physical Exam ination s 
• A complete physical examination will include, at a minimum, assessment s of the 
cardiovascular, respiratory, gastrointestinal and neurological systems. Height and 
weight will also be measured and recorded. 
• A symptom-driven physical examination will focus on the evaluation of the subject ’s 
reported signs and symptoms.  
• Investigators should pay special attention to clinical signs related to previous serious illnesses. 
8.3.4. Vital Signs  
• Temperature, pulse rate, respiratory rate, and blood pressure will be assessed.  
• Blood pressure and pulse measurements will be assessed with a completely automated 
device. Manual techniques will be used only if an automated device is not available. 
• Blood pressure and pulse measurements should be preceded by at least 5 minutes of 
rest for the subject in a quiet setting without distractions (eg, television, cell phones).  
• Vital signs will be measured in a semi -supine position after 5 minutes rest and will 
include temperature, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulse, and respiratory rate.  
• For etigilimab infusions: 
o For first infusion measure vital signs within 60 minutes before infusion, every 
15 (±5 minutes) during the infusion and 30 (± 10 min) and 90 ( ±15) minutes after 
the end of the infusion.  
Mereo Biopharma 5 , Inc . Etigilimab  
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 53 of 110 o For subsequent infusions, measure vital signs within 60 minutes before infusion, 
during infusion if clinically indicated and 30 (± 10) minutes after the end of the 
etigilimab infusion.   
• For nivolumab infusions vital signs should be taken per institutional guidelines. 
8.3.5. Electrocardiogram s 
• 12-lead ECG  will be obtained  as outlined in the So A (see Section 8.1 ) using an ECG 
machine that automatically calculates the heart rate and measures pulse rate, QRS, QT, and corrected QT intervals.   
8.3.6. Clinical Safety Laboratory Assessments  
• Refer to Appendix 2 for the list of c linical laboratory tests to be performed and to the 
SoA for the timing and frequency.  
• The investigator must review the laboratory report, document this review, and record any clinically relevant changes occurring during the study in the AE  section of the 
CRF. The laboratory reports must be filed with the sour ce documents.  Clinically 
significant abnormal laboratory findings are those which are not associated with the underlying disease, unless judged by the investigator to be more severe than expected for the subject’ s condition. 
• All laboratory tests with values considered clinically significantly abnormal during participation in the study or within 30  days after the last dose of study treatment 
should be repeated until the values return to normal or baseline. If such values do not return to normal /baseline  with in a period of time judged reasonable by the 
investigator, the etiology should be identified, and the sponsor notified. 
• All protocol -required laboratory assessments, as defined in Appendix 2, must be 
conducted in accordance with the laboratory manual and the So A.  
• If laboratory values from non-protocol specified laboratory assessments performed at 
the institution’s local laboratory require a change in subject management or are 
considered clinically significant by the investigator (eg, SAE or AE or dose hold), then the results must be recorded in the CRF.  
8.3.7. Immunogenicity Assessments  
Antibodies to etigilimab  will be evaluated in serum samples collected from all subject s 
according to the SoA. Additionally, serum samples should also be collected at the final visit from subject s who discontinued study treatment or were withdrawn from the study. These 
samples will be t ested by the sponsor or sponsor’ s designee.  
Serum samples will be screened for antibodies binding to etigilimab  and the titer of 
confirmed positive samples will be reported. Other analyses may be performed to verify the stability of antibodies to etigilimab  and/or further characterize the immunogenicity of 
etigilimab.  
The detection and characterization of antibodies to etigilimab  will be performed using a 
validated assay method by a lab vendor under the supervision of the sponsor. All samples colle cted for detection of antibodies to study treatment will also be evaluated for  etigilimab  
serum concentration to enable interpretation of the antibody data. Antibodies may be further 
Mereo Biopharma 5 , Inc . Etigilimab  
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 54 of 110 characterized and/or evaluated for their ability to neutralize the activity of the study 
treatment(s).  
Samples may be stored for a maximum of 1 year following the last subject ’s last visit for the 
study at a facility selected by the sponsor to enable further analysis of immune responses to etigilimab .  
8.4. Pharmacokinetics  
• Blood samples will be collected for measurement of serum  concentrations of 
etigilimab  as specified in Table 3. Other  samples  may be collected at additional 
timepoints during the study if warranted and agreed upon between the investigator and the sponsor. Instructions for the collection and handling of biological samples 
will be provided by the sponsor in the laboratory manual. The actual date and time (24-hour clock time) of each sample will be recorded . 
• Genetic analyses will not be performed on these blood or serum  samples. Subject 
confidentiality will be maintained.  At visits during which samples for the 
determination of serum  concentration of  etigilimab  will be taken , 1 blood draw of 
sufficient volume can be used.  
8.5. Pharmacogenomics  
A 6-mL blood sample for DNA isolation will be collected from subjects who have consented 
to participate in the pharmacogenomics component of the study. P articipation is optional. 
Subject s who do not wish to participate in the genetic research may still participate in the 
study. 
DNA samples may be used for research related to etigilimab and nivolumab. 
Pharmacogenomic research may consist of the analysis of 1 or more candidate genes or the analysis of genetic markers throughout the genome (as appropriate) in relation to etigilimab and nivolumab or oncology clinical endpoints.  
The final disposition of samples will be conducted per local regulations. Details on processes 
for collection  and shipment of these samples can be found in the Lab oratory  Manual .  
8.6. Biomarkers  and Biopsies  
Blood and tumor samples will be obtained for biomarker evaluation from all eligible subjects 
prior to treatment and on treatment as detailed in the SoA. Samples will be processed for the determination of changes in signaling marker s downstream of the TIGIT -PVR/PVRL2 axis,  
Tregs , and potential predictive biomarkers.  
Blood biomarkers : A predose sample of 33 mL will be drawn at screening , on Study Days 1, 
8, 22, and 36, every 6 weeks after Day 36 for subjects continuing on study drug, and at treatment termination to evaluate changes in plasma proteins eg, IL17, IL2, IFNγ, etc., TIGIT and immune- related gene expression and possible T -cell clonality by mRNA detection 
(eg, CD226, T-cell genes) and changes in peripheral blood mononuclear cell populations (PBMCs) and activation by flow cytometry.  
Tumor tissue: Tumor tissue  is required for enrollment. If archival f ormalin -fixed, paraffin-
embedded ( FFPE) tumor tissue has not been collected preferably within 6 months of 
Mereo Biopharma 5 , Inc . Etigilimab  
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 55 of 110 screening , but no longer than 1 year, or is not available, either fresh core or punch needle 
biopsy is required at study entry (3 fresh cores/punches preferred whenever possible).  
Pre-treatment b iopsy : Baseline tumor tissue samples consisting of core needle biopsies of 
deep tumor tissue or lymph nodes or excisional, incisional, punch, or forceps biopsies of 
cutaneous, subcutaneous, or mucosal lesions will be obtained for all subjects. Subjects undergoi ng core needle biopsy should have accessible lesion(s) that permit a total of at least 
2 biopsies (pretreatment and on -treatment) without unacceptable risk of major procedural 
complication (one pretreatment and an optional one on- treatment biopsy will be performed; 
minimum diameter, 18  gauge). If possible, at least 3 cores will be collected. One or 2 cores 
will be shipped to central laboratory  formalin fixed in ethanol and an additional core will be 
fresh frozen.  
On-treatment biopsy : An optional subsequent  biopsy will be performed if the subject 
consents to the procedure. The biopsy will be performed approximately 8 weeks ( ± 5 days) 
following the first administration of etigilimab if not medically contraindicated. In the  event 
that the second biopsy cannot be performed approximately 8 weeks after the first administration of etigilimab, the Medical Monitor should be notified to discuss alternative timing for the second biopsy. An additional biopsy may be collected per investigator discretion, preferably at the time of radiographic progression or response. If possible, at least 3 cores will be collected. One or 2 cores will be shipped to central lab formalin fixed in ethanol and an additional core will be fresh frozen. 
Requirements and procedures for pre- treatment and on- treatment biopsy collection are 
identical. The expression of TIGIT, PVR, PVRL2, FOXP3 and other immune markers 
(eg, protein and/or RNA) may be assessed in tumor specimens. The expression levels of additional proteins and genes (eg, immune gene s ignatures) may be evaluated and correlated 
with clinical benefit. Additionally, DNA testing (eg , TMB, mismatch repair genes, TIGIT 
pathway related genes etc.) of the tumor tissue may be performed on subjects using the tumor specimens collected.  
Cell-free D NA: A 10 mL blood sample for cell- free tumor DNA assessments will be 
collected pre-dose on Study Day 1, Day 36, Day 78 and treatment termination. Analysis of genes relevant to TIGIT, disease genes, mutation burden, and mismatch repair etc. may be performed. 
8.7. Skin Biopsy  
If a skin rash occurs during study treatment, an optional biopsy and pictures of the skin rash  
will be performed. The expression of immune infiltrate may be assessed by hematoxylin and eosin staining and/or IHC. 
8.8. Deviation Reporting  
The following protocol deviations will be recorded and summarized in the final report: 
1) enrollment violations, 2) dosing violations, 3) concomitant therapy violations, and 4) continuation of therapy when treatment should have been discontinued.

Data collected in this study will be presented descriptively using summary tables, figures, and 
data listings. Continuous variables will be summarized using mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum. Categorical variables wil l be summarized using counts 
and percentages. Missing values will not be imputed unless otherwise stated.  
9.1. Sample Size Determination   
This is a P hase 1b/2 open ‐label basket  study of etigilimab (MPH313) (  mg dose for 
subjects ≥50 kg,  mg/kg dose for subjects <50 kg) IV administered Q2W with nivolumab 240 mg Q2W to evaluate preliminary anti- tumor activity, safety and tolerability, PK  
parameters, immunogenicity, and biomarkers in up to 9 cohorts of subjects with endometrial carcinoma , HNSCC, cervical cancer , ovarian c ancer , gastric c ancer  and gastroesophageal 
junction adenocarcinoma , TMB -H/MSS c ancer , sarcoma, germ c ell tumors , and uveal 
melanoma. Each cohort will be evaluated using a Simon Two-Stage design appropriate to the 
clinically meaningful response rate for the indication as depicted in Figure 5 below. Interim futility monitoring for each individual cohort using the clinically meaningful response rate criteria per cohort will be carried out in accordance with the optimal Simon Two -Stage 
design when up to 10 subjects have sufficient data (either discontinued study drug treatment or having at least one post-baseline imaging assessment) for ORR and DoR evaluation by RECIST v1.1.  For each cohort, the second stage may be opened for enrollme nt only after 
discussion with the IDMC and the sponsor. The sponsor may have an independent assessment of responses to verify i nvestigator -reported responses. The responses based on independent 
assessments, if available, will be used for sensitivity analysis with sponsor and will make 
recommendations regarding study conduct, including whether to continue, modify, or stop the study.

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 57 of 110 Type 1 Cohort 
The null hypothesis that the true response rate is 0.05 will be tested agai nst a one-sided 
alternative that the true response rate is at least 0. 2. In the first stage, 10 subjects will be 
enrolled and enrollment in this cohort will be halted until the response data are mature. 
If there are fewer than 1 responder in these 10 subje cts, further enrollment in the cohort may  
be stopped after review of efficacy and safety data, and discussion by Sponsor with the IDMC.  Otherwise, once 1 or more responders in stage 1 are observed, 19 additional subjects 
may be enrolled for a total of 29. The null hypothesis will be rejected and the treatment will be declared effective and worthy of further testing if 4 or more responders are observed in 29 subjects. This design yields a type I error rate of 0.0468 and power of 80.11% when the true response rate is  0.2. 
Type 2 Cohort 
The null hypothesis that the true response rate is 0.1 will be tested against a one- sided 
alternative that the true response rate is at least 0. 3. In the first stage, 10 subjects will be 
enrolled and enrollment in this cohort will be halted until the response data are mature. 
If there are fewer than 2 responders in these 10 subjects, enrollment in the cohort may be 
stopped after review of efficacy and safety data, and discussion by Sponsor with the IDMC. Otherwise, once 2 or more responders in stage 1 are observed, 19 additional subjects may be enrolled for a total of 29. The null hypothesis will be rejected and the treatment will be declared effective and worthy of further testing if 6 or more responders are observed in 29 subjects. This design yields a type I error rate of 0. 0471 and power of 80.51% when the 
true response rate is  0.3. 
9.2. Populations for Analyses 
The i ntent -to-treat (ITT) analysis set is defined as all subjects who signed an informed 
consent form and were en rolled into the study . 
The Safety analysis set is defined as all subjects who received any amount of study drug. All safety analyses will be performed using the Safety analysis set.  
The Response- Evaluable analysis set is a modified ITT analysis set defined as all subjects 
with measurable disease at baseline who received study treatment and had at least one post -
baseline response assessment or discontinued treatment due to disease prog ression (including 
death due to disease progression) within 16 weeks (+ a 2 -week window) of the first dose of 
study treatment. All efficacy analyses will be performed using the Response- Evaluable 
analysis set.  
9.3. Statistical Analyses  
All statistical analyses for this study will be undertaken by a contract research organization 
under the supervision of sponsor personnel. Any data analysis carried out independently by the investigator should be submitted to the sponsor prior to publication or presentation. 
All data will be listed. All trial endpoints will be described using summary statistics. Data 
will be summarized using descriptive statistics for continuous data (safety laboratory data, pharmacodynamic and relevant biomarker data), and contingency tables for c ategorical data 
Mereo Biopharma 5 , Inc . Etigilimab  
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 58 of 110 (demographics and other baseline characteristics, efficacy measurements, safety 
measurements and all relevant PK measurements.  
For statistical analyses and summaries, baseline is defined as the available data from the last recorded measurem ent prior to first administration of study drug.  
Details of statistical analysis and data reporting will be provided in a SAP document finalized prior to database lock. Additional analyses may be added in the SAP and tables, listings and figures shells wi ll also be provided. 
The SAP  will be developed and finalized before  database lock and will describe the selection 
of subject s to be included in the analyses, and procedures for accounting for missing, unused, 
and spurious data. Below is a summary of planne d statistical analyses of the study endpoints. 
9.3.1. Efficacy Analyses 
Efficacy analyses will be performed separately for each cohort. RECIST 1.1 criteria will be used for the primary endpoint evaluation ( Eisenhauer et al., 2009), and iRECIST will be used 
for the exploratory endpoint response evaluation ( Seymour et al., 2017). The iRECIST  
endpoints are analyzed using the same statistical methodology and the results will be presented in the same ways for the corresponding RECIST 1.1 endpoints.  
The primary efficacy endpoint is the ORR defined as the proportion of subjects who achieve 
confirmed CR or PR per RECIST v1.1. The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment until PD. The smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started will be used as the reference for PD. Subjects with  CR or PR are 
considered to have obtained objective response. Subjects with not-evaluable response (NE) are counted as non -responders. Exact 95% CI  will be constructed for the ORR  for each 
cohort. 
Subjects with CR, PR or SD are considered to have achieved disease control. Disease control 
rate is defined as the proportion of subjects who have achieved CR, PR, and SD. Duration of 
response only applies to subjects whose best overall response is CR or PR and is defined as 
the number of days from the first docum entation of objective tumor response to the date of 
first PD or death due to underlying cancer. 
Duration of stable disease is measured from the start of the treatment (the first treatment date 
for non- randomized studies, the randomization date for randomiz ed studies) until the date 
when the criteria for overall disease progression are first met.  
Duration of response is the time from first evaluation showing CR or PR (response 
confirmation required at subsequent tumor assessment no earlier than 4 weeks after first 
evaluation showing CR or PR) to the time of the first subsequent evaluation showing PD or death. Only subjects who experience a confirmed CR or PR will be analyzed for DoR. Subjects who do not experience PD or death will be censored per the censori ng rules in the 
statistical analysis plan.  
Progression- free survival is defined as the number of days from Day 1 in Cycle 1 to the first 
documented progression or death due to any cause. Only deaths that occurred within 30 days of the last progression assessed.  
Mereo Biopharma 5 , Inc . Etigilimab  
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 59 of 110 Overall survival  is defined as the time from the first dose of study drug to death due to any 
cause.  
Overall survival, PFS, and DoR will be summarized for each group using Kaplan- Meier 
methodology. Censoring rules will be detailed in the statistical analysis plan.  
• For analysis of OS , all subjects will be followed for survival for up to 2 years, until 
withdrawal of consent, loss to follow up, or death, whichever occurs first. At the time 
of analysis of OS, any subjects who remain alive will be censored  at the last date they 
were known to be alive. 
• PFS is the time from the start of study treatment to the first evaluation showing PD or 
death, whichever occurs first. Subjects who do not experience PD or death will be 
censored per the censoring rules in the statistical analysis plan.  
9.3.2. Safety Analyses 
Adverse events will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) version 18.0 or higher and will be graded according to the NCI‐CTCAE, v 4.03 
or higher. 
Summaries of AEs will be based on  TEAEs. A TEAE is an AE that emerges or worsens i n 
the period from the first dose of  study treatment etigilimab or nivolumab, whichever is 
earlier , to 100 days after the last dose of etigilimab or nivolumab (whichever is dosed last) or 
until starting another  treatment.  
TEAEs  will be summarized by treatment group and by the frequency of subjects experiencing 
TEAEs  corresponding to MedDRA system organ classes and preferred terms.  
Separate tabulations will also be produced for TEAEs assessed as related to study drug(s), 
TEAEs that led  to treatment discontinu ation, TEAEs that led to death, and TEAEs ≥Grade 3 
in severity. Treatment‐emergent serious AEs and SAEs related to study drug(s) will also be 
tabulated. 
Laboratory results (hematology, serum or plasma chemistry , and coagulation) and the 
corresponding change from baseline values will be summarized by group and scheduled 
timepoint. A shift table, tabulation for baseline to each scheduled assessment and the worst post treatment value according to the CTCAE grade, wi ll be provided for selected clinical 
laboratory tests. Laboratory results together with the normal ranges and CTCAE grade will be listed. Lab oratory values that are below or above the normal ranges will be flagged. 
Vital signs and ECGs and the corresponding changes from baseline will be summarized by group and scheduled timepoint.  
9.3.3. Pharmaco kinetic Analyses  
The PK  analysis set will include all Phase 1b subjects with sufficient plasma concentration 
data to allow the characterization of the PK parameters.  Plasma etigilimab concentration data 
at each assessment timepoint will be summarized and listed and will be plotted across time. 
Pharmacokinetic parameters will be calculated using non -compartmental techniques from 
plasma concentrations and will include the following parameters: maximum concentration 
Mereo Biopharma 5 , Inc . Etigilimab  
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 60 of 110 observed, clearance, elimination half- life, and area under the curve. P harmacokinetic  
parameters will be summarized descriptively for each group.  
9.3.4. Immunogenicity  Analyses  
The immunogenicity analysis set will inclu de all subjects with at least one evaluable post -
treatment immunogenicity sample.  Blood samples for evaluation of ADA will be collected to 
determine the relationship between ADA and etigilimab PK parameters.  
9.3.5. Exploratory Analyses  
Blood samples for evaluation of pharmacodynamics biomarkers, immune biomarkers, and 
exploratory predictive biomarkers will be collected from all subjects to determine their correlation with ORR  and DCR.

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 71 of 110 APPENDIX 4: ADVERSE EVENTS: DEFINITIONS AND PROCEDURES FOR 
RECORDING, EVALUATING, FOLLOW -UP, AND 
REPORTING  
Definition of AE 
AE Definition  
• An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject  or clinical study subject, temporally 
associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the 
medicinal product.  
• NOTE: An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the 
use of a medicinal product.  
 
Events Meeting  the AE Definition  
• Any abnormal laboratory test results (hematology, clinical chemistry, or urinalysis) or other 
safety assessments ( e.g., ECG , radiological scans, vital signs measurements), including those 
that worsen from baseline, considered  clinically significant in the medical and scientific 
judgment  of the investigator (ie , not related to progression  of underlying disease ). 
• Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre -existing condition including either an increase in 
frequency and/or intensity of the condition.  
• New conditions detected or diagnosed after study treatment administration even though it may have been present before the start of the study.  
• Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected drug-drug interaction. 
• Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study treatment or a concomitant medication . Overdose per se will not be reported as an AE/SAE unless it is an 
intentional overdose taken with possible suicidal/self- harming intent. Such overdoses should 
be reported regardless of sequelae.  
• “Lack of efficacy ” or “ failure of expected pharmacological action ” per se will not be reported 
as an AE or SAE.  Such instances will be captured in the efficacy assessments.  However, the 
signs, symptoms, and/or clinical sequelae resulting from lack of efficacy  will be reported as 
AE or SAE  if they fulfil the definition of an AE or SAE.  
• The signs, symptoms, and/or clinical sequelae resulting from lack of efficacy will be reported as AE or SAE  if they fulfil the definition of an AE or SAE. Also, “lack of efficacy ” or “ failure 
of expected phar macological action ” also constitutes an AE or SAE.  
 
Events NOT  Meeting the AE D efinition  
• Any clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings or other abnormal safety assessments which are associated with the underlying disease, unless judged by the investigator to be more severe than expected for the subject ’s condition.  
• The disease/disorder being studied or expected progression, signs, or symptoms of the disease/disorder being studied, unless more severe than expected for the subject ’s condition.  
• Medical or surgical procedure ( eg, endoscopy, appendectomy): the condition t hat leads to the 
procedure is the AE.  
• Situations in which an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or convenience 
admission to a hospital).  
• Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of pre -existing disease(s) or condition(s) present or 
detected a t the start of the study that do not worsen.  
Mereo Biopharma 5 , Inc . Etigilimab  
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 72 of 110 Definition of SAE  
If an event is not an AE per definition above, then it cannot be an SAE even if serious 
conditions are met (eg, hospitalization for signs/symptoms of the disease under study, death due to progression of disease).  
A SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose:  
a. Results in death  
b. Is life- threatening  
The term ‘ life-threatening ’ in the definition of ‘serious’ refers to an event in which the 
subject was at risk of death at the time of the event.  It does not refer to an event, which 
hypothetically might have caused death, if it were more severe.  
c. Requires  inpatient  hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
In general, hospitalization  signifies that the subject has been detained (usually involving at 
least an overnight stay) at the hospital or emergency ward for observation and/or treatment that would not have been appropriate in the physician’s office or out patient setting. 
Complications that occur during hospitalization are AE. If a complication prolongs hospitalization or fulfills any other serious criteria, the event is serious.  When in doubt as 
to whether “hospitalization” occurred or was necessary, the AE should be considered serious. 
Hospitalization for elective treatment of a pre -existing condition that did not worsen from 
baseline is not considered an AE.  
d. Results in persistent disability/incapacity  
• The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions.  
• This definition is not intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma ( eg, sprained ankle) which may interfere  with or prevent 
everyday life functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption . 
e. Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
f. Other situations:  
• Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether SAE reporting 
is appropriate in other situations such as important medical events that may not be immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize 
the subject  or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other 
outcomes listed in the above definition. These events should usually  be considered 
serious. 
Examples of such events include invasive or malignant cancers, intensive trea tment in 
an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization, or development of drug dependency 
or drug abuse . 
 
Mereo Biopharma 5 , Inc . Etigilimab  
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 73 of 110 Definition of A ESI 
Adverse events of special interest (AESIs) are def ined as events (serious or non- serious) 
which are of scientific and medical concern specific to the sponsor’s product or program, for 
which ongoing monitoring and rapid communication by the investigator to the sponsor may be appropriate. Such events may re quire further investigation in order to characterize and 
understand them . 
AESIs for etigilimab  
Some AEs, despite their severity or outcome, will be expedited due to the relevance for participant safety or study treatment safety profile. These events should be reported to the sponsor/designee within 24 hours. This is to enable follow-up to be performed on all these reported adverse events that have not been reported as serious adverse events (SAEs). The AESIs for et igilimab  are: 
• Infusion reactions,  
• Immune ‐related adverse events  
AESIs  that are considered to be clinically significant by the PI and/ or medical team will 
also be submitted to the independent DMC for review.
 
 
Recording AE  / AESI  and SAE 
AE, AESI  and SAE Recording  
• When an AE /AESI  /SAE occurs, it is the responsibility of the investigator to review all 
documentation (eg, hospital progress notes, laboratory, and diagnostics reports) related 
to the event. 
• The investigator will then record all relevant AE /AESI /SAE information in the CRF . 
• It is not  acceptable for the investigator to send photocopies of the subject ’s medical 
records to the sponsor or their representatives in lieu of completion of the 
AE/AESI/SAE CRF page.  
• There may be instances when copies of medical records for certain cases are requested 
by th e sponsor or their representatives . In this case, all subject  identifiers, with the 
exception of the subject  number, will be blinded on the copies of the medical records 
before submission to the sponsor or their representatives . 
• The investigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, 
symptoms, and/or other clinical information. In such cases, the diagnosis (not the individual signs/symptoms) will be documented as the AE/ AESI /SAE .
 
 
Assessment of Intensity  
• The investigator will make an assessment of Grade  for each AE , AESI  and SAE 
reported during the study according  to the NCI  Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events version 5 (CTCAE v 5) or higher.  
 
Mereo Biopharma 5 , Inc . Etigilimab  
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 74 of 110 Assessment of Causality  
• The investigator is obligated to assess the relationship between study treatment and 
each occurrence of each AE/ AESI/SAE.  
• A “reasonable possibility ” of a relationship conveys that there are facts, evidence, 
and/or arguments to suggest a causal relationship , rather than a relationship cannot be 
ruled out. 
• The investigator will use clinical judgment to determine the relationship.  
• Alternative causes, such as underlying disease (s), concomitant therapy, and other risk 
factors, as well as the temporal relationship of the event to study treatment administration will be considered and investigated. 
• The investigator will also consult the Investigator’s  Brochure (IB) and/or Product 
Information, for marketed products, in his/her assessment.  
• Fo
r each AE/ AESI /SAE , the investigator must  document in the medical notes that 
he/she has reviewed the AE/ AESI /SAE and has provided an assessment of causality.  
• T here may be situations in which an SAE  /AESI  has occurred and the investigator has 
minimal information to include in the initial report.  However, it is very important 
that the investigator always make an assessment of causality for every event before the initial transmission of the SAE  / AESI  data. 
• The investigator may change his/her opinion of causality in light of follow-up information  and send an SAE / AESI follow -up report with the updated causality 
assessment . 
• The causality assessment is one of the criteria used when determining regulatory reporting requirements.
 
 
Follow- up of AE , AESI  and SAE  
• The investigator is obligated to perform or arrange for the conduct of supplemental measurements and/or evaluations as medically indicated or as requested by the sponsor 
or their representatives  to elucidate the nature and/or causality of the AE , AESI  or 
SAE as fully as possible. This may include additional laboratory tests or 
investigations, histopathological examinations, or consultation with other health care professionals. 
• If a subject  dies during participation in the study or during a recognized follow-up 
period, the investigator will provide the sponsor or their representatives with a copy of any post- mortem findings including the autopsy report and histopathology. 
• New or updated information will be recorded in the originally completed CRF.  
• The investi gator will submit any updated SAE  / AESI  data to the sponsor within 
24 hours of receipt of the information . 
 
Mereo Biopharma 5 , Inc . Etigilimab  
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 75 of 110 Reporting of SAE to Sponsor

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 76 of 110 APPENDIX 5: CONTRACEPTIVE GUIDANCE AND COLLECTION OF 
PREGNANCY INFORMATION 
Definitions  
Woman of Childbearing Potential (WOCBP)  
A woman is considered fertile following menarche and until becoming post-menopausal unless permanently sterile. Permanent sterilization methods include hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy, and bilateral oophorectomy. 
Women in the follow ing categories are not considered WOCBP 
1. Premenopausal female with 1 of the following:  
• Documented hysterectomy  
• Documented bilateral salpingectomy  
• Documented bilateral oophorectomy  
Note:  Documentation can come from the site personnel’s: review of subject’s 
medical records, medical examination, or medical history interview.  
2. Premenarchal  
3. Postmenopausal female  
• A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an alternative medical cause. A high follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the postmenopausal range may be used to confirm a post menopausal state in 
women not using hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement therapy (HRT). However , in the absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, a single FSH 
measurement is insuffici ent.  
• Females on HRT and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of the non-hormonal highly effective contraception methods if they wish to continue their HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of postmenopausal status before study enrollment. 
Contraception Guidance 
Males Subjects 
1. Male subjects with female partners of child -bearing potential are eligible to 
participate if they agree to the following : 
• Are abstinent from penile -vaginal intercourse as their usual and preferred 
lifestyle (abstinent on a long term and persistent basis) and agree to remain 
abstinent for duration of study and for 6 months after study completion or from last dose  
• Female partner is using a highly effective contraceptive method  
2. For non-genotoxic IMPs with demonstrated or suspected human teratogenicity / fetotoxicity at subtherapeutic exposure levels {where it is theoretically possible that relevant systemic concentrations may be achieved in WOCBP from exposure to seminal fluid) to prevent exposure of an embryo/fetus   
3. Agree to use a male condom plus an additional method with a failure rate of <1% per year as described in the table below when having penile- vaginal intercourse 
with a woman of childbearing potential   
Mereo Biopharma 5 , Inc . Etigilimab  
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 77 of 110 4. Men with a pregnant or breastfeeding partner must agree to remain abstinent from 
penile-vaginal intercourse or use a male condom during each episode of penile penetration for duration of study and for 6 months after study completion or from last dose 
5. Refrain from donating sperm for duration of study and for 6 months after study 
completion or from last dose  
Table 5 Highly Effective Contraceptive Methods That Are User Dependent   
Failure rate of <1% per year when used consistently and correctly.   
 Combined (estrogen - and progestogen -containing) hormonal contraception associated with 
inhibition of ovulationb  
• oral  
• intravaginal  
• transdermal  
 Progestogen -only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulationb  
• oral  
• injectable  
Highly Effective Methods That Are User Independent   
• Implantable progestogen -only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of 
ovulationb 
• Intrauterine device (IUD)  
• Intrauterine hormone -releasing system (IUS)  
• bilateral tubal occlusion  
 Vasectomized partner  
(A vasectomized partner is a highly effective contraception method provided that the partner is 
the sole male sexual partner of the WOCBP and the absence of sperm has been confirmed. If not, 
an additional highly effective method of contraception should be used )  
 Sexual abstinence  
(Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining from heterosexual intercou rse during the entire period of risk associated with the study drug. The 
reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the study and 
the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject .)  
NOTES:  
a) Typical use failure rates may differ from those when used consistently and correctly. Use 
should be consistent with local regulations regarding the use of contraceptive methods for 
subject s participating in clinical studies.  
b) Hormonal contraception may be susceptible to interaction with the study drug, which may 
reduce the efficacy of the contraceptive method. In this case two  highly effective methods of 
contraception should be utilized during the treatment period and for at least 6 months  after the 
last dose of study drug  
 
Female S ubject s 
Female subject s of reproductive potential are eligible to participate if they agree to use a 
highly effective method of contraception consistently and correctly as described in Tabl e 5 
above.

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 78 of 110 Pregnancy Testing  
• WOCBP should only be included after a confirmed menstrual period and a highly 
sensitive negative serum  pregnancy test  
• Additional pregnancy testing will be performed at Treatment Termination after the last 
dose of study drug and as required by local  clinic al guidance  
• Pregnancy testing will be performed whenever a menstrual cycle is missed or when pregnancy is otherwise suspected   
• Pregnancy testing will be performed and assayed in a certified laboratory  
Collection of Pregnancy Information of Male subjects with partners of reproductive 
potential who become pregnant  
• Investigator will attempt to collect pregnancy information on any female partner of a 
male study subject who becomes pregnant while participating in this study. This applies 
only to subject s who receive study drug . 
• After obtaining the necessary signed informed consent from the pregnant female partner 
directly, the investigator will record pregnancy information on the appropriate form and submit it to Sponsor within 24 hours of learning of the partner’s pregnancy  
• Partner will also be followed to determine the outcome of the pregnancy. Information on the status of the mother and child will be forwarded to Sponsor 
• Generally, follow-up will be no longer than 6 to 8 weeks following the estimated delivery date. Any termination of the pregnancy will be reported regardless of fetal status (presence or absence of anomalies) or indication for procedure   
Female Subject s who become pregnant  
Any female subject who becomes pregnant while participating will discontinue study drug or 
be withdrawn from the study.  
• Investigator will collect pregnancy information on any female subject , who becomes 
pregnant while participating in this study   
• Information will be recorded on the appropriate form and submitted to Spo nsor within 
24 hours of learning of a subject’s pregnancy.  
• Subject will be followed to determine the outcome of the pregnancy. The investigator will collect follow up information on subject and neonate, which will be forwarded to 
Sponsor. Generally, follow-up will not be required for longer than 6 to 8 weeks beyond the estimated delivery date.   
• Any termination of pregnancy will be reported, regardless of fetal status (presence or 
absence of anomalies) or indication for procedure.  
• While pregnancy itself i s not considered to be an AE or SAE, any pregnancy 
complication or elective termination of a pregnancy will be reported as an AE or SAE.   
• A spontaneous abortion is always considered to be an SAE and will be reported as such.   
• Any SAE occurring as a result of a post-study pregnancy which is considered reasonably related to the study drug by the investigator, will be reported to Sponsor . While the 
investigator is not obligated to actively seek this information in former study subject s, he 
or she may learn of an SAE through spontaneous reporting.

Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Quick Reference  
ELIGIBILITY  
Only subjects with measurable or evaluable disease at baseline should be included in 
protocols where objective tumor response is the primary endpoint. 
Measurable Disease – the presence of at least one measurable lesion. If the measurable 
disease is restricted to a soli tary lesion, its neoplastic nature should be confirmed by 
cytology/histology. 
Measurable Lesions – lesions that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension with 
the minimum size of:  
o 10 mm by CT scan or MRI (no less than double the slice thickness and a minimum of 10 mm).  
o 10 mm caliper measurement by clinical exam (lesions which cannot be accurately measured with calipers should be recorded as non- measurable ). 
o 15 mm for nodal disease in short axis  
o 20 mm by chest X-ray (if clearly defined and surrounded by aerated lung) 
o Malignant lymph node: 15 mm in short axis when assessed by CT scan (CT scan slice thickness no greater than 5 mm). At baseline and in follow-up only the short axis is to be followed. 
Non-Mea
surable Lesions – all other lesions, includin g small lesions (longest diameter 
<10 mm or pathological lymph nodes with >10 to <15 mm short axis) as well as truly non-
measurable lesions. Lesions considered truly non- measurable include leptomeningeal disease, 
ascites, pleural/pericardial effusion, infl ammatory breast disease, lymphangitic involvement 
of skin or lung, abdominal masses/abdominal organomegaly identified by physical examination that is not measurable by reproducible imaging techniques, and nodal disease that is 10 to <15 mm in short axis.   
Special Considerations Regarding Lesion Measurability:  Bone lesions, cystic lesions, and le
sions previously treated with local therapy require particular comment:  
Bone lesions:  
• Bone scan, PET scan or  plain films are not considered adequate imaging techniques to 
measure bone lesions. However, these techniques can be used to confirm the presence or disappearance of bone lesions.  
• Lytic bone lesions or mixed lytic- blastic lesions, with identifiable soft tissue components, 
that can be evaluated by cross sectional imaging techniques such as CT or MRI can be considered as measurable lesions if the soft tissue component meets the definition of measurability described above.  
• Blastic bone lesions are non -measurable.  
Mereo Biopharma 5 , Inc . Etigilimab  
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 81 of 110 Cystic lesions:  
• Lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple cysts should not be 
considered as malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non- measurable) since they are, 
by definition, simple cysts.  
• ‘Cystic lesions’ thought to represent cystic metasta ses can be considered as measurable 
lesions, if they meet the definition of measurability described above. However, if noncystic lesions are present in the same subject, these are preferred for selection as target lesions.  
Lesions with prior local treatment:  
• Tumor lesions situated in a previously irradiated area, or in an area subjected to other loco- regional therapy, are usually not considered measurable unless there has been 
demonstrated progression in the lesion. Study protocols should detail the conditions under which such lesions would be considered measurable. 
Measurement of Lesions 
• All measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation, using calipers if clinically assessed. All baseline evaluations should be performed as closely as possible to the beginning of treatment and never more than 28 days before the beginning of the treatment.  
Methods of Measurement  
• The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each identified and reported lesion at baseline and  at each subsequent response 
assessment. Imaging based evaluation should always be done rather than clinical examination unless the lesion(s) being followed cannot be imaged but are assessable by clinical examination.  
• For the case of skin lesions, documentation by color photography, including a ruler to 
estimate the size of the lesion, is recommended.  
• CT is currently the best currently available and reproducible method to measure target 
lesions selected for response assessment. The CT scan slice thickness should be 5 mm or 
less. When the CT scans have a slice thickness that is greater than 5 mm, the minimum size for a measurable lesion should be twice the slice thickness. MRI is also acceptable.   
• Lesions on chest X- ray are acceptable as measurable lesions when they are clearly 
defined and surrounded by aerated lung. However, CT is preferable. 
• Ultrasound (US) should not be used to measure tumor lesions. The utilization of endoscopy and laparoscopy for objective tumor evaluations not advised. 
• Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography ( FDG- PET) can be used to determine 
a new lesion if the lesion was absent at baseline on FDG- PET 
• Tumor markers alone cannot be used to assess response. If markers are initially above the upper normal limit, they must normalize for a subject to be considered in complete response when all lesions have disappeared.  
• Cytology and histology can be used to differentiate between PR and CR in rare cases (eg, after treatment to differentiate between residual benign lesions and residual malignant lesions in tumor types such as germ cell tumors).  
Mereo Biopharma 5 , Inc . Etigilimab  
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 82 of 110 Baseline Documentation of “Target” and “Non -Target” Lesions 
• All measurable lesions up to a maximum of two lesions per organ and 5 lesions in total, 
representative of all involved organs should be identified as target lesions  and recorded 
and measured at baseline.  
• Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest 
diameter [LD] ) and be representative of all involved organs, but in addition should lend 
themselves accurate repeated measurements.  
• A sum of the LD for all target lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline su m 
diameters. The baseline sum diameters will be used as reference by which to characterize 
the objective tumor. If lymph nodes are to be included in the sum, then as noted above, only the short axis is added to the sum. 
• If a target lesion becomes too small to measure, a default value of 5 mm is assigned.  If the lesion disappears, the measurement is recorded at 0 mm.  
• If extranodal target lesions fragment, the LDs of the fragmented portions are added in the sum. If targets lesions coalesce and cannot be dist inguished, the LD of the coalesced 
lesion is added to the sum.  
• For a subject with SD or PR, a lesion which disappears and then reappears will continue 
to be measured and added to the sum. Response will depend upon the status of the other 
lesions. For a subject with CR, reappearance of a lesion is considered PD.  
• New lesions should be unequivocal and not attributable to differences in scanning technique or findings which may not be tumor. If a new lesion is equivocal, repeat scans are needed to confirm. If confirmed, PD is assessed from the date of the first scan.  
• All other lesions (or sites of disease) should be identified as non- target lesions  and 
should also be recorded at baseline. Measurements of these lesions are not required, but the presence or absence of each or in rare case unequivocal progression should be noted at each subsequent response assessment.  
RESPONSE CRITERIA  
Evaluation of Target Lesions 
Complete Response (CR):  Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph node 
(whether  target  or nontarget) must have reduction in short axis to 
<10 mm 
Partial Response (PR):  At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters 
Progressive Disease (PD):  At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an 
absolute increase of at least 5 mm. The appearance of one or more 
new lesions is also considered progression.  
 
Mereo Biopharma 5 , Inc . Etigilimab  
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 83 of 110 Evaluation of Non-Target Lesions 
Complete Response (CR):  Disappearance of all non -target lesions and normalization of tumor 
marker level. All lymph nodes must be non-pathological in size 
(ie, <10 mm short axis).  
Non-CR/Non-PD  Persistence of one or more non-target lesion(s) and/or maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits  
Progressive Disease (PD):  Unequivocal progression of the existi ng non-target lesions. The 
appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progressive disease.  
Although a clear progression of “non target” lesions only is exceptional, in such circumstances, the 
opinion of the investigator should prevail.

• Subjects with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of treatment 
without objective evidence of disease progression at that time should be classified as 
having “symptomatic deterioration”.  Every effort should be made to document the objective progression even after discontinuation of treatment. 
• In some circumstances it may be difficult to distinguish residual disease from normal tissue. When the evaluation of complete response depends on this determination, it is recommended that the residual lesion be investigated (fine needle aspirate/biopsy) to confirm the complete response status.  If described in the clinical protocol, FDG -PET 
may be used to upgrade a response to a CR in a manner similar to a biopsy in cases where a residual radiographic abnormality is thought to represent fibrosis or scarring  
REPORTING OF RESULTS  
All subjects included in the study must be assessed for response to treatment, even if there are major protocol treatment deviations or if they are ineligible. Each subject will be assigned one of the following categories:  1) complete response, 2) partial response, 3) stable disease, 4) progressive disease, 5) not evaluable for response:  specify reason such as early death from malignant disease, early death from toxicity, tumor assessments not repeated/incomplete, or other (specify).

These general guidelines constitute guidance to the investigator and may be supplemented by 
discussions with the Medical Monitor or designee. The guidance applies to all immuno-oncology agents and regimens. 
A general principle is that differential diagnoses should be diligently evaluated according to 
standard medical practice. Non -inflammatory etiologies should be considered and 
appropriately treate d. 
Corticosteroids are a primary therapy for immuno -oncology drug- related adverse events. The 
oral equivalent of the recommended IV doses may be considered for ambulatory subjects with low -grade toxicity. The lower bioavailability of oral corticosteroids should be taken into 
account when switching to the equivalent dose of oral corticosteroids.  
Consultation with a medical or surgical specialist, especially prior to an invasive diagnostic or therapeutic procedure, is recommended.  
The frequency and severity of the related adverse events covered by these algorithms will depend on the immuno-oncology agent or regimen being used.

(ACTIVATE)  
Development Phase:  1b/2 
 
Overall Design  
Schematic:  
 
 
Written description  This is an open -label, multicenter, Phase 1b/2 basket study designed to 
evaluate the efficacy, safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics  (PK) , and 
pharmacodynamics  (PD)  of etigilimab in combination with nivolumab in 
subjects with recurrent , locally advanced and/or metastatic solid tumors 
who are not candidates for available, curative standard of care therapies. In 
cohorts enrolling tumor types for whom anti -PD-1 antibody therapy is 
approved treatment for recurrent, locally advanced or metastatic disease, 
subjects may be enrolled prior to treatment with anti -PD-1 antibody 
therapy.  Subjects will be assigned to receive etigilimab (  mg every 
2 weeks for subjects ≥50 kg,  mg/kg dose every 2 weeks for subjects 
<50 kg) in combination with nivolumab (240 mg every 2 weeks) and will 
continue until protocol -defined discontinuation criteria are met. Cohorts 
will be enrolled at the discretion of the s ponsor . Selected cohorts will be 
open for the first 20 subjects enrolled without increasing the tota l number 
of subjects proposed for the trial. During the conduct of this open label 
study an Independent Data Monitoring Committee  (IDMC ) will be 
established and will review study data on an ongoing basis.     
Screening period  All screening tests must  be performed  within  28 days preceding Day 1 
(defined as the first day of study drug administration), unless otherwise  
indicated. Results of standard‐of‐care tests or examinations performed  prior 
to obtaining  informed consent and  within  the screening  window may  be 
used and do  not have to be repeated if they meet  protocol  specifications. 
The screening period will include medical history and demographic data  
collection,  physical exam ination  including  vital signs, laboratory 
assessments including hematology,  serum chemistry and  urinalysis, 
electrocardiogram (ECG),  collection  of blood  for immunogenicity, PK, and

paraffin‐embedded (FFPE)  or fresh tumor samples for biomarker 
assessments.  
Treatment period  Subjects will be assigned to receive etigilimab (  mg every 2 weeks for 
subjects ≥50 kg,  mg/kg dose every 2 weeks for subjects <50 kg) in 
combination with nivolumab (240 mg every 2 weeks) and will continue 
until protocol -defined discontinuation criteria are met . 
Follow‐up period  All subjects who have discontinued  study drug treatment will return  to the 
clinic for  a treatment termination visit within 30 days after  the last dose of  
etigilimab  or nivolumab,  whichever occurs last. Following etigilimab and  
nivolumab study treatment discontinuation, all subjects will be  followed  for 
survival  and subsequent  anti‐cancer therapy  via telephone calls,  subject 
medical records, and/or  clinic visits approximately every  3 months  until 
death,  loss to follow‐up, or study  termination by the sponsor unless  the 
subject  requests  to be  withdrawn from  follow‐up.

 This is a  Phase 1b/2 Open‐Label  Basket  Study of etigilimab (MPH313) (  mg dose for subjects ≥ 50 kg, 
 mg/kg dose for subjects <50 kg) IV administered Q2W with nivolumab 240 mg Q2W to evaluate 
preliminary anti -tumor activity, safety and tolerability, PK parameters, imm unogenicity, and biomarkers in up 
to 9 cohorts of subjects with EC, HNSCC, cervical cancer , ovarian cancer , gastric cancer  and 
gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma , TMB -H/MSS cancer , sarcoma, germ cell tumors , and uveal 
melanoma) Each cohort will be evaluated using a Simon Two- Stage design appropriate to the clinically 
meaningful response rate for the indication. Interim futility monitoring for each individual cohort using the clinically meaningful response rate criteria per cohort will be carried out in accordance with the optimal Simon Two -Stage design when up to 10 subjects have sufficient data (either discontinued study drug 
treatment or having at least one post -baseline imaging assessment) for ORR and DoR evaluation by 
RECIST  v1.1.  For each cohort, the second stage may be opened for enrollment only after discussion with the 
IDMC and the sponsor.  
Type 1 Cohort  
The null hypothesis that the true response rate is 0.05 will be tested against a one -sided alternative that the 
true re sponse rate is at least 0.2. In the first stage, 10 subjects will be enrolled and enrollment in this cohort 
will be halted until the response data are mature. If there are fewer than 1  responder in these 10 subjects, 
further enrollment in the cohort may be  stopped after review of efficacy and safety data, and discussion by 
Sponsor with the IDMC. Otherwise, once 1 or more responders in stage 1 are observed, 19 additional subjects may be enrolled for a total of 29. The null hypothesis will be rejected and the  treatment will be declared 
effective and worthy of further testing if 4 or more responders are observed in 29 subjects. This design yields 
a type I error rate of 0.0468 and power of 80.11% when the true response rate is  0.2. 
Type 2 Cohort  
The null hypothesis that the true response rate is 0.1 will be tested against a one -sided alternative that the true 
response rate is at least 0.3. In the first stage, 10 subjects will be enrolled and enrollment in this cohort will be 
halted until the response data are mature. If there are fewer than 2  responders in these 10 subjects, enrollment 
in the cohort may be stopped after review of efficacy and safety data, and discussion by Sponsor with the 
IDMC. Otherwise, once 2 or more responders in stage 1 are observed, 19 additional subjects may be enrolled 
for a total of 29. The null hypothesis will be rejected and the treatment will be declared effective and worthy of further testing if 6 or more responders are observed in 29  subjects. This design yields a type I error  rate of 
0.0471 and power of 80.51% when the true response rate is  0.3. 
The Intent -to-Treat (ITT) analysis set is defined as all subjects who signed an informed consent form and 
were enrolled into the study.  
The Safety analysis set is defined as all subjects who received any amount of study drug. All safety analyses will be performed using the Safety analysis set.  
The Response -Evaluable analysis set is a modified ITT analysis set defined as all subjects with measurable 
disease at baseline who received study  treatment and had at least one post -baseline response assessment or 
discontinued treatment due to disease progression (including death due to disease progression) within 
16 weeks (+ a 2 -week window) of the first dose of study treatment. All efficacy analy ses will be performed 
using the Response -Evaluable analysis set.  
Efficacy analyses will be performed separately for each cohort. RECIST 1.1 criteria will be used for primary 
endpoint evaluation ( Eisenhauer et al., 2009 ), iRECIST will be used for exploratory endpoint response

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 107  of 110 evaluation ( Seymour et al., 2017 ). The iRECIST endpoints are analyzed using the same statistical 
methodology and the results will be presented in the same ways for the corresponding RECIST 1.1 endpoints.  
The primary efficacy  endpoint is the objective response rate (ORR) defined as the proportion of subjects who 
achieve confirmed CR or PR per RECIST v1.1. The best overall response is the best response recorded from 
the start of the treatment until PD. The smallest measurements  recorded since the treatment started will be 
used as the reference for PD. Subjects with CR or PR are considered to have obtained objective response. Subjects with not-evaluable response (NE) are counted as non -responders. Exact 95% confidence intervals 
will be constructed for the ORR for each cohort.  
Disease control rate: Subjects with CR, PR or SD are considered to have achieved disease control. Disease 
control rate is defined as the proportion of subjects who have achieved CR, PR, and SD. Duration of 
Response only applies to subjects whose best overall response is CR or PR and is defined as the number of 
days from the first documentation of objective tumor response to the date of first PD or death due to 
underlying cancer.  
Duration of stable disease  is measured from the start of the treatment (the first treatment date for non -
randomized studies, the randomization date for randomized studies) until the date when the criteria for overall 
disease progression are first met. Duration of stable disease is defin ed as follows for the following cohort will 
also be considered for Simon -2 Stage futility monitoring in the rare cancer cohort for subjects with germ cell 
tumors only.  
Progression- free Survival  
PFS is defined as the number of days from Day 1 in Cycle 1 to the first documented progression or death due 
to any cause. Only deaths that occurred within 30 days of the last progression assessed.  
OS, PFS, and DoR will be summarized for each group using Kaplan- Meier methodology. Censoring rules will 
be detailed in the statistical analysis plan.  
• For analysis of OS, all subjects will be followed for survival for up to 2 years, until withdrawal of consent, loss to follow -up, or death, whichever occurs first. At the time of analysis of OS, any 
subjects who remain alive wi ll be censored at the last date they were known to be alive.  
• PFS is the time from the start of study treatment to the first evaluation showing PD or death, 
whichever occurs first. Subjects who do not experience PD or death will be censored per the 
censorin g rules in the statistical analysis plan.  
DoR is the time from first evaluation showing CR or PR (response confirmation required at subsequent tumor 
assessment no earlier than 4 weeks after first evaluation showing CR or PR) to the time of the first subseq uent 
evaluation showing PD or death. Only subjects who experience a confirmed CR or PR will be analyzed for 
DoR. Subjects who do not experience PD or death will be censored per the censoring rules in the statistical 
analysis plan.

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 108  of 110 The Safety analysis set is defined as all subjects who received any amount of study drug.  All safety analyses 
will be performed using the Safety analysis set.  
Adverse events will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA)  version  18.0 
or higher and will be graded according to the NCI‐CTCAE, v 4.03 or higher.  
Summaries of AEs will be based on  treatment‐emergent AEs (TEAEs). A TEAE is an AE that emerges  or 
worsens  in the period from  the first dose of  study treatment  etigilimab or nivolumab, whichever is earlier)  to 
100 days after the last dose  of etigilimab or nivolumab (whichever is dosed last) or until starting another 
treatment.  
TEAEs will be summarized by treatment group and by the frequency of subjects  experiencing TEAEs  
corresponding to MedDRA  system organ  classes  and preferred  terms.  
Separate tabulations will also be produced for TEAEs assessed as related  to study  drug(s),  TEAEs that led to 
treatment  discontinuation, TEAEs  that led to death, and  TEAEs ≥Grade 3 in severity. Treatment‐emergent  
serious adverse event s (SAEs) and  SAEs related to study drug(s) will also  be tabulated.  
Laboratory results (hematology, serum or plasma chemistry and coagulation) and the corresponding change 
from baseline values will be summarized by group and scheduled timepoint. A shift table, tabulation for 
baseline to each scheduled assessment and the worst post treatment value according to the CTCAE grade, will 
be provided for selected clinical laboratory tests. Laboratory results together with the normal ranges and 
CTCAE grade will be listed. Lab values that are below or above the normal ranges will be flagged.  
Vital signs and ECGs and the corresponding changes from baseline will be summarized by group and 
scheduled timepoint.  
The PK analysis set will include all Phase 1b subjects with sufficient plasma concentration data to allow the 
characterization of the PK parameters. Plasma etigilimab concentration data at each assessment timepoint will be summarized and listed and will be plott ed across time. Pharmacokinetic parameters will be calculated using 
non-compartmental techniques from plasma concentrations and will include the following parameters: 
maximum concentration observed, clearance, elimination half -life, and area under the curve. P harmacokinetic 
parameters will be summarized descriptively for each group.  
The immunogenicity analysis set will include all subjects with at least one evaluable post -treatment 
immunogenicity sample. Blood samples for evaluation of anti -drug antibodies  (ADA) will be collected to 
determine the relationship between ADA and etigilimab PK parameters.  
Blood samples for evaluation of pharmacodynamics biomarkers, immune biomarkers, and exploratory predictive biomarkers will be collected from all subjects to determine their correlation with ORR and DCR.

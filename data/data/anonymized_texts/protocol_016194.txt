2/P OSI3364g-A6  PROTOCOL AMENDMENT, VERSION A6: 
RATIONALE 
The results of the final analysis of the BETA Lung trial (OSI3364g), an international, 
randomized, placebo-controlled, Phase III trial, were presented at the 2008 Chicago Lung meeting by Dr. John Hainsworth on behalf of the BETA investigators.  The addition of bevacizumab to erlotinib in the BETA lung st udy provided evidence of clinical activity 
by doubling progression free survival and the overall response rate.  However, this 
clinical benefit was not associated with an improvement in survival. 
At the time of this amendment, there are 4 patients receiving single-agent erlotinib in this 
study. All of the patients remaining in the study are located in the United States. 
Protocol Study OSI3364g has been amended because the study has been completed 
and no further patient data will be collected, except for serious adverse event reporting via MedWatch Food and Drug Administration 3500 Forms, no longer with the CRFs, and will be handled according to instructions in Section 5.4 . 
Additional changes to the protocol are as follows: 
• Despite being unblinded in 2008, some patients are still receiving study drugs from 
treatment bottles assigned via the interactive voice response system labeled as 
“OSI-774 25mg, 100mg or 150mg” as per study protocol.  Upon enactment of this 
amendment, patients will be receiving study drugs directly from Astellas Pharma US, Inc. labeled as “erlotinib” at their current dosage. 
• Upon enactment of Amendment 6, no dose adjustments will be permitted.  Any 
patient requiring a dose modification because of an adverse event or disease 
progression should be terminated from the study and treated following the 
physican’s usual standard of care.  
The sample Informed Consent Form has also been revised to reflect the changes to the 
study protocol. 
Additional minor changes have been made to improve clarity and consistency.  
Substantive new information appears in italics.   This amendment represents cumulative 
changes to the original protocol.

3/P OSI3364g-A6  PROTOCOL AMENDMENT, VERSION A6: 
 
PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS 
The protocol synopsis has been updated to reflect the changes to the protocol, where 
applicable. 
SECTION 2.2:  SECONDARY OBJECTIVES 
The secondary objectives of this Phase III study were as follows: 
• To evaluate the safety of combining bevacizumab with Tarceva in patients with 
previously treated advanced NSCLC, including patients with squamous cell 
carcinoma, patients with treated brain metastases, and patients receiving full-dose anticoagulation with low-molecular-weight heparin or fondaparinux. 
Note:  See Section 4.1.2 for the eligibility criteria regarding squamous cell carcinoma patients. 
Note:  The safety profile of patients who remai n on protocol treatment at the enactment of 
amendment 5 will be evaluated to better characterize the long term safety of the 
bevacizumab and erlotinib combination.  
Note: Upon enactment of Amendment 6, safety data collection will be restricted 
to the reporting of serious adverse events via MedWatch FDA 3500 forms 
(Appendi x D ) and will not be captured in the CRF. 
 
SECTION 3.3.4:  Safety Outcome Measures  
The safety outcome measures for this study were the following: 
• Incidence and severity of adverse events and serious adverse events 
• Changes in laboratory values  
Patient safety after Amendment 5 will be assessed through summari es of serious adverse events.  
Patient safety after Amendment 6 will be restricted to the spontaneous reporting of 
serious adverse events via Me dWatch FDA 3500 forms and will not be captured in the 
CRF.  
SECTION 3.4:  SAFETY PLAN 
Upon enactment of Amendment 6, data collection will be restricted to reporting of 
serious adverse events  via MedWatch FDA 3500 forms (not in the CRF), and handled 
according to instructions in Section 5.4. SAE data will be collected via the safety database only. Prior to Amendment 6, the safety plan was as below. 
See Section 4.3.4and Section 5 for complete details of the safety evaluation for this 
study. 
 
Bevacizumab and Erlotinib—Genentech, Inc. 
4/P OSI3364g-A6  A number of measures have been taken to ensure the safety of patients participating in 
this study.  These measures were addressed through the exclusion criteria (see Section 4.1.3) and routine monitoring as follows. 
Patients enrolled in this study were evaluated clinically and with standard laboratory 
tests before and at regular intervals during t heir participation in this study.  Safety 
evaluations consisting of medical interviews, recording of concomitant medications and adverse events, physical examinations, blood pressure, and laboratory measurements 
(performed by local laboratories, see Section 4.5 and  Appendix A) have been conducted.  Patients have been evaluated for adverse events (all grades), serious adverse events, and adverse events requiring study drug interruption or discontinuation 
at each study visit while on study drug.  Patients discontinued from the treatment phase of the study for any reason were evaluated ~30 days (28− 42 days) after the decision to 
discontinue treatment (see Section 4.5.3).  Patients with an ongoing Grade 4 or serious 
adverse event at the time of discontinuation from study treatment were and 
will cont inue 
to be followed until the event is resolved or determined to be irreversible by the 
investigator (see Section 4.5.3 ). 
Specific monitoring procedures were as follows: 
• Hypertension was monitored through routine evaluation of blood pressure. 
• In patients with bleeding, a hemostasis evaluation was performed as clinically 
indicated.  In patients with hemoptysis, bevacizumab should be permanently 
discontinued and protocol guidelines followed (see Section 4.3.4 and Table 2). Early use of bronchoscopy to identify the site of bleeding should also be considered. 
• Patients with a history of brain metastases were monitored for the development of 
symptomatic Grade  ≥ 2 CNS hemorrhage (NCI CTCAE, Version 3.0).  Symptomatic 
is defined as clinical symptoms that are determined by the investigator to be directly referable to a CNS hemorrhage.  Bevacizumab should be discontinued and protocol guidelines followed in patients who develop symptomatic Grade ≥ 2 CNS 
hemorrhage (see Section 4.3.4 and Table 2). 
• Patients requiring full-dose anticoagulation could be treated with 
low-molecular-weight heparin or fondaparinux; these patients were and have been monitored for Grade ≥  3 hemorrhage events.  Full-dose anticoagulation with 
warfarin is prohibited; however, prophylactic doses were allowable. 
• Bevacizumab should be discontinued and protocol guidelines followed in patients 
who develop symptomatic Grade ≥  2 CNS hemorrhage or Grade ≥  3 hemorrhage 
(see Section 4.3.4 and Table 2).  
• Because of the potential for drug–drug interaction between Tarceva and warfarin, 
patients who received concomitant prophylact ic/low-dose warfarin therapy were to 
be monitored closely for INR changes or bleeding. 
• Chronic use of full-dose nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) was not 
allowed while on study treatment.  If required, the patient must be discontinued from bevacizumab/placebo. 
 
Bevacizumab and Erlotinib—Genentech, Inc. 
5/P OSI3364g-A6  • Aspirin up to, but not exceeding, 325 mg per day could be given to patients at high 
risk for arterial thromboembolic disease.  Patients developing signs or symptoms of 
arterial thromboembolic events (see Table 2)  while on study treatment were asked 
to discontinue bevacizumab/placebo. 
• Proteinuria was monitored through regular urinalysis and urinary protein to 
creatinine ratio.  Screening for proteinuria at ex-U.S. sites was performed with a 
urine dipstick (patients found to have ≥ 3+ proteinuria by dipstick had to undergo a 
24-hour urine collection) 
• Symptoms consistent with ILD, such as new onset dyspnea, cough, or fever without 
an obvious cause were to be evaluated.  In the event that ILD was suspected, study treatment was to be discontinued and the patient given appropriate medical management.  Although there is no proven t herapy, systemic corticosteroids are 
often provided.  Tarceva should not be restarted in patients suspected of having drug-related ILD. 
• NCI-CTC Grade 3 conjunctivitis and keratitis have been reported infrequently in 
patients receiving Tarceva therapy.  Patients were asked to seek medical advice promptly if they experienced eye irritation during Tarceva therapy. 
 
See Section 4.3.4 for detailed instructions about the management of study drug-related 
toxicities.  The DMC monitored the safety of this study by reviewing serious adverse events every month and during the two interim analyses.  Members of the DMC were external to Genentech and followed a charter that outlines the Committee’s composition and the members’ roles and responsibilities. 
Safety monitoring for patients who remain on study treatment after the final analysis will be 
conducted by Genentech or Genentech’s agent.  
SECTION 3.7:  ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
Genentech performed will perform  safety reviews after the final analysis.  
The final analysis of OSI3364g showed that the addition of bevacizumab to erlotinib 
improved PFS and ORR.  However, this clinical benefit was not associated with an improvement in survival. 
Amendment 5 allowed  was designed to give 
investigators and patients who had have not 
progressed the option to continue active study treatment until disease progression, while 
continuing to provide long-term data on the safety of the bevacizumab and erlotinib combination.  
Forty-eight patients remained on study treatment at the time of the final BETA analysis.  
Some had been on study for more than 1 year.  The continued collection of safety 
information on these long-term non-progressing patients  allowed will allow 
for a better 
description of the long-term safety profile of the bevacizumab and erlotinib combination. 
 
Bevacizumab and Erlotinib—Genentech, Inc. 
6/P OSI3364g-A6  All placebo treatment in the BETA trial will be discontinued to remove the risks and 
discomforts associated with infusion therapy.  
Investigators and patients are not obligated to remain on study treatment.  They may 
choose to discontinue trial participation given the failure of the study to meet its primary endpoint of improved overall survival. 
Upon enactment of Amendment 6, data collection will be restricted to spontaneous 
reporting of serious adverse events via MedWatch FDA 3500 forms (not in the case report form [CRF]), and handled according to instructions in Section 5.4. SAE data will be collected via the safety database only. 
SECTION 4.2:  METHOD OF TREA TMENT ASSIGNMENT AND BLINDING 
Note: This study has been fully recruited and all subjects were unblinded to study drug 
following the final analysis. Upon enactment of Amendment 6, the interactive voice response system (IVRS) will be cancelled. Prior to enactment of Amendment 6, treatment assignment and unblinding were managed as below. 
After written informed consent was obtained and eligibility established (with archival 
tissue identified and available for research testing), the study site obtained the patient’s identification number and treatment assignment from the IVRS.  Patients could be randomized up to 5 days prior to receiving their first dose of study treatment.  A hierarchical dynamic randomization schem e was used to ensure an approximately equal 
sample size for the two treatment arms overall, within each of the four categories defined by baseline ECOG performance status (0/1  vs. 2) and smoking history (never vs. 
current/previous), within each sex, and within each study site. 
Genentech, the investigator, and the patient were blinded to treatment assignment.  
Unblinding of treatment assignment prior to final study analysis was permitted only for a serious study drug–related toxicity.  All cases of safety unblinding required the approval of the Medical Monitor.  After the final analysis, unblinding information was provided to all sites with patients receiving study treatment.  Unblinding information for patients who had completed study treatment prior to the final analysis was provided upon request. 
If a patient discontinued Tarceva therapy because of unmanageable toxicity, an 
unblinding request could be made to determine the treatment assignment.  Study bevacizumab/placebo was discontinued and subsequent therapy provided at the discretion of the treating clinician. 
Requests for unblinding may be made by calling the Medical Monitor directly during 
business hours (PST) at the following telephone number:

  Telephone No.:   
Approval of the request and unblinding of study drug assignment will occur only during 
business hours.  
Any toxicities associated or possibly associated with bevacizumab treatment were and 
should be managed according to standard medical practice.  Discontinuation of bevacizumab has no immediate therapeutic effect.  Bevacizumab has a terminal half-life of 2–3 weeks; therefore, its discontinuation results in slow elimination over several 
months.  There is no available antidote for bevacizumab.  The i
Investigators  were 
allowed to hold administration of study drug while waiting for a decision on unblinding to 
be made. 
SECTION 4.3.1:  Formulation  
b. Tarceva 
Tarceva will continues to  be supplied by Astellas OSI Pharmaceuticals  US on behalf of

objectives
 
Primary Objective 
The primary objective of this Phase III study was to evaluate the efficacy of combining 
bevacizumab with Tarceva (erlotinib) relative to Tarceva monotherapy in patients receiving 
second-line therapy for advanced NSCLC.  Efficacy will be assessed by measuring overall survival. 
The addition of bevacizumab to erlotinib in the BETA lung study was not associated with an 
improvement in overall survival.  However, bevacizumab when combined with erlotinib improved 
progression-free survival (PFS) and overall respon se rate (ORR), demonstrating evidence of 
clinical activity.   
 
Secondary Objectives 
The secondary objectives of this Phase III study were as follows: 
• To evaluate the safety of combining bevacizumab with Tarceva in patients with previously 
treated advanced NSCLC, including patients with  squamous cell carcinoma, patients with 
treated brain metastases, and patients receiving full-dose anticoagulation with 
low-molecular-weight heparin or fondaparinux. 
Note:  See Section 4.1.2 for the eligibility criteria regarding squamous cell carcinoma 
patients. 
Upon enactment of Amendment 6, patients still benefiting from their treatment will continue to receive 
it until disease progression, but no CRF data will be collected anymore. Seriou s Adverse Events will be 
collected spontaneously via MedWatch FDA 3500 forms ( Appendix D) and will no  longer be captured in 
the CRF.

18/P OSI3364g-A6 • To evaluate the efficacy of combining beva cizumab with Tarceva relative to Tarceva 
monotherapy in patients with previously treated advanced NSCLC, as measured by PFS, 
ORR,  and duration of response 
• To evaluate the pharmacokinetic behavior of  Tarceva and the combination of bevacizumab 
with Tarceva in a subset of patients with previously treated advanced NSCLC 
• To evaluate the association of  survival, PFS, and treatment effect with markers of epidermal 
growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression, as measured by immunohistochemistry (IHC), 
EGFR gene copy number measured by fluorescenc e in situ hybridization (FISH), and other 
molecular markers of EGFR pathway activity in archival tissue samples 
 
study Design  
This is a Phase III, multicenter , placebo-controlled, double-b lind, randomized study.  Six 
hundred thirty-six patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of two treatment arms: 
• Arm 1:  Tarceva  + placebo 
• Arm 2:  Tarceva  + bevacizumab 
 
Outcome MeasureS  
Primary Efficacy Outcome Measure 
The primary efficacy outcome measure for this study was overall surviv al, defined as the period 
from the date of randomization until the date of patient death from any cause. 
The addition of bevacizumab to erlotinib in the BETA lung study was not associated with an 
improvement in overall survival.  However, bevacizumab when combined with erlotinib improved 
PFS and ORR, demonstrating evidence of clinical activity.  See Appendix C. 
 
Secondary Efficacy Outcome Measures 
The secondary efficacy outcome measures were as follows: 
• PFS, defined as the time from randomiz ation to documented disease progression, as 
determined by the investigator using the Res ponse Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 
(RECIST), or death on study treatment, whichever occurs first 
• Objective response, as determined by the investigator using RECIST 
• Duration of objective response, defined as t he period from the date of initial partial or 
complete response (as determined by the in vestigator using RECIST) until the date of 
disease progression or death from any cause on study treatment 
• Evaluation of the relationship between molecular exploratory markers and efficacy 
outcomes 
 
Pharmacokinetic Outcome Measures 
The pharmacokinetic outcome measures for erlo tinib and its metabolite (OSI-420) were as 
follows: 
• Maximum concentration at steady state ( Cmax,ss)  
• Time of the maximum concentration at steady state ( Tmax,ss) 
• Minimum concentration at steady state ( Cmin,ss)  
• Apparent clearance at steady state 
• Area under the erlotinib time −concentration curve (AUC 0–tau) 
The pharmacokinetic outcome measures for bevacizumab were as follows: 
• Maximum concentration ( Cmax) 
• Minimum concentration ( Cmin)

19/P OSI3364g-A6 Safety Outcome Measures 
The safety outcome measures for this study were the following: 
• Incidence and severity of adverse events and serious adverse events 
• Changes in laboratory values  
Upon enactment of Amendment 6, data collection will be restricted to the spontaneous 
reporting of serious adverse events via MedWatch FDA 3500 forms and will no longer be 
captured in the CRF. 
 
Safety Plan  
Upon enactment of Amendment 6, data collection will be restricted to the spontaneous 
reporting of serious adverse events via MedWatch FDA 3500 forms and will no longer be captured in the CRF.  Prior to Amendment 6, the safety plan was as below. 
Patients enrolled in this study were evaluated clin ically and with standard laboratory tests before 
and at regular intervals during their participation in  this study.  Safety evaluations consisting of 
medical interviews, recording of concomitant medications and adverse events, physical examinations, blood pressure, and laboratory meas urements (performed by local laboratories, 
see Section 4.5 and Appendix A) have been conducted.  Patients have been evaluated for adverse events (all grades), serious adverse events, and adverse events requiring study drug 
interruption or discontinuation at each study vi sit while on study drug.  Patients discontinued 
from the treatment phase of the study for any reason were evaluated ~30 days (28–42 days) 
after the decision to discontinue treatment (s ee Section 4.5.3).  Patients with an ongoing 
Grade 4 or serious adverse event at the time  of discontinuation from study treatment were  
followed until the event is resolved or determined to be irreversible by the investigator (see Section 4.5.3). 
 
Study Treatment  
The dose of bevacizumab in this study continues to be 15 mg/kg administered by IV infusion on the first day of each 3-week cycle ( ± 4 days; the interval between infusions must not be < 17 
days).  The bevacizumab dose should be based on the patient’s weight at screening (within 7 
days prior to randomization) and should rema in the same throughout the study ( ± 5% dosing 
variation).  If bevacizumab/placebo administration fell outside of the 4-day visit window, for 
reasons other than toxicity management, the site had to obtain a protocol waiver prior to the 
infusion.  The patient’s schedule was then adjusted so that the subsequent 
bevacizumab/placebo infusion was given 3 weeks after the re-scheduled infusion. 
Protocol waivers are no longer required for changes in treatment.  Changes in the treatment 
dose or schedule may be made based upon the inve stigator’s judgment and the institutional 
guidelines of the site.  Placebo dosing will be discontinued for all patients on the Tarceva and 
placebo arm of the trial without evidence of pr ogression as of the enactment of BETA lung trial 
Amendment 5.   
The initial bevacizumab/placebo dose was delivered over 90 (±  10) minutes as a continuous IV 
infusion on Day 0.  If a patient experienced an infusion-associated adverse event, he or she 
could be pre-medicated for the next study drug in fusion; however, the infusion time could not be 
decreased for the subsequent infusion.  If the first infusion was tolerated without 
infusion-associated adverse events, the seco nd infusion could be delivered over 60 minutes 
(± 10 minutes).  If a patient experienced infusion -associated adverse events with the 60-minute 
infusion, all subsequent doses were to be giv en over 90 minutes.  If the 60-minute infusion was 
well tolerated, all subsequent infusions could be delivered over 30 ± 10 minutes.  If a patient 
experienced infusion-associated adverse events with the 30-minute infusion, all subsequent 
doses were to be given over 60 minutes.  If the patient continued to experience infusion-
associated adverse events with the 90-minute in fusion, the patient’s symptoms were managed 
per institutional standard of care.  
Upon enactment of Amendment 6, no dose adjustme nts will be permitted.  If a patient needs a 
reduced dose, she/he will be withdrawn from the study and will be treated following the 
physician’s usual standard of care 
 
 
Bevacizumab and Erlotinib—Genentech, Inc. 
20/P OSI3364g-A6 Concomitant Therapy AND CLINICAL PRACTICE  
All concomitant medications administered within 14 days preceding the initial study treatment 
administration on this study through the 30-day Post −Study Treatment Discontinuation Visit 
were recorded.  The reason(s) for treatment, dosage, and dates of treatment should have been 
reported to the investigator and recorded as instructed on the study-specific Case Report Forms (CRFs). 
Patients using oral contraceptives, hormone replacement therapy, or other maintenance therapy 
were asked to continue their use.  Patients received full supportive care, including hematopoietic growth factors, transfusions  of blood and blood products, antibiotics, 
anti-emetics, etc., when appropriate.  Use of anti-tumor therapies was permitted after study 
treatment discontinuation. 
Patients who experience infusion-associated temperature elevations to ≥  38.5 °C (101.3 °F) or 
other infusion-associated symptoms may be treated symptomatically with acetaminophen, 
diphenhydramine, meperidine, or other medications as clinically indicated, including ≤ 48 hours 
of treatment with corticosteroids. 
It is recommended that patients with indwelli ng venous catheters receive prophylaxis against 
catheter thrombosis in accordance with the local standard of care.  Full-dose anticoagulation 
using low-molecular-weight heparin or fondaparinux  is permitted, starting either prior to study 
enrollment or during study participation.  Beca use of a potential drug–drug interaction between 
Tarceva and warfarin, it is preferable that patient s receive low-dose warfar in for this purpose.  
Patients receiving prophylactic or low-dose warfarin or its equivalent require close INR 
monitoring. 
Because of the bleeding risk associated with bev acizumab, chronic use of aspirin at a dose of 
> 325 mg/day and full-dose NSAIDs are to be avoided. 
Prolonged use of systemic corticosteroids for the treatment of skin toxicities is discouraged.  
Patients who are taking corticosteroids for reason s other than skin toxicity at study entry may 
continue their use.   
 
Statistical Methods  
Primary Efficacy Analysis 
Analyses of overall survival and PFS included all patients who were randomized.  For objective 
response and clinical benefit, only patients with  measurable disease at baseline were included 
in the analysis.  For duration of response, only responders were included in the analysis.  All 
analyses were based on the treatment arm to which patients were randomized. 
The primary efficacy endpoint was overall su rvival, defined as the period from the date of 
randomization (as entered in the IVRS) until the date of patient death from any cause.  All 
deaths were included, regardless of whether they occur during treatment or following treatment 
discontinuation.  For patients who have not died, survival data were censored at the date of last 
contact.   
The two-sided log-rank test, stratified by the randomization stratification factors, was used to 
perform hypothesis testing for assessing t he primary study objective.  The randomization 
stratification factors were ECOG performance stat us (0/1 vs. 2), smoking history (never vs. 
current/previous), sex (male vs. female), and study  site; however, because of the large number 
of study sites in this trial, study sites will not be included in any efficacy analyses adjusted for 
randomization stratification factors.  Levels of the stratification factors reported on the CRF were 
used in the analysis.  A sensit ivity analysis stratified using levels reported on the IVRS was 
performed.  Both analyses were based on the treatment arm to which the patients have been 
randomized.   An interim efficacy analysis was conducted wh en approximately 67% of the required deaths 
(280 deaths) occurred.  Overall survival was tested at the significance level determined using 
the Lan-DeMets alpha spending function with an O’Brien-Fleming boundary so that the overall 
type I error rate will be maintained at the 0.05 level.  The DMC recommended that the study 
continue as planned.  The final efficacy anal ysis was conducted when 418 deaths occurred. 
The unstratified log-rank test was performed as a sensitivity analysis.  The Kaplan-Meier 
methods were used to estimate median over all survival for each treatment arm.  Cox 
 
Bevacizumab and Erlotinib—Genentech, Inc. 
21/P OSI3364g-A6 proportional hazard models, using two models (with and without stratification by the 
randomization stratification factors), were employed to estimate the hazard ratio (i.e., the 
magnitude of treatment effect and 95% CI).   
Upon enactments of Amendment 6, all the remaining patients in the study receive single 
agent open-label erlotinib. No further analysis will be done. 
 
Safety Analyses 
Safety was assessed through summaries of adv erse events and laboratory test results.  
Patients who receive any amount of study treatment will be included in the safety assessment.  
Safety results were summarized by the treatment patients actually received for all patients, for 
patients with squamous cell carcinoma, for pati ents with brain metastases treated prior to 
enrollment, and for patients receiving full-dos e anticoagulation with low-molecular-weight 
heparin or fondaparinux. 
Safety data collected after the final analysis will be reviewed and summarized for inclusion in 
the Investigator’s Brochure by  Genentech or Genentech’s agent.  
Upon enactment of Amendment 6, safety data co llection will be restricted to the spontaneous 
reporting of serious adverse events via MedWat ch FDA 3500 forms and will not  be captured 
in the CRF. 
 
Missing Data 
For overall survival, patients who were lost to follow-up were analyzed as censored 
observations on the date of last contact. 
Details of the analyses of missing data were prov ided in the Statistical Analysis Plan.  
 
Determination of Sample Size 
This was a Phase III study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of bevaciz umab in combination 
with Tarceva relative to Tarceva alone in adv anced NSCLC.  A 33% improvement in survival 
was considered a clinically significant outcome.  To calculate the number of deaths required in 
this study, the following assumptions were made: 
• Two-sided log-rank test 
• 83% power at the 5% significance level 
• Hazard ratio of bevacizumab  + Tarceva versus control (Tarceva alone)  
of 0.75 corresponding to a 33% improvement in median overall survival from 8 to 
10.67 months 
• Median overall survival for the control arm is hypothesized based on data from 
Study BR.21, taking into account t he difference in patient population. 
• An interim efficacy analysis will be performed when 67% of the required deaths have 
occurred.  The significance level will be determined using the Lan-DeMets alpha spending 
function with an O’Brien-Fleming boundary. 
• Five percent of patients will withdraw consent for survival follow-up or will be lost to follow-
up. 
With these assumptions, 417 deaths were  required for the final analysis.   
 
Interim Analyses 
The eligible patient population was expanded to include selected patients with squamous cell 
carcinoma, patients with brain metastases tr eated prior to enrollment, and patients receiving 
full-dose anticoagulation with low-molecular-weight heparin or fondaparinux.  A DMC monitored 
the safety of these and all other patients on this  trial.  The DMC reviewed safety summaries 
prepared by an external statistical data coordi nating center, including monthly serious adverse 
event reports and thorough interim safety reports .  Members of the DMC were external to 
Genentech and followed a charter that outlined thei r role and responsibilities.  Study personnel 
remain blinded to study results until the fo rmal unblinding took place in October 2008. 
All patients were monitored clinically at 3-we ek intervals and radiographically at 6-week 
intervals through Week 24, at which point scans were followed at 12-week intervals.  Patients 
 
Bevacizumab and Erlotinib—Genentech, Inc. 
22/P OSI3364g-A6 with a history of brain metastases also under went head CT scans or MRI scans every 6 weeks 
after Day 0 (beginning at Week 6) through Week 24 and then every 12 weeks thereafter.  
Summaries of collected serious adverse event s were reviewed by the DMC monthly for all 
patients, for patients with squamous cell carcinoma, and for patients with brain metastases 
treated prior to enrollment.  
All NCI CTCAE Grade ≥ 3 hemoptysis and symptomatic Grade ≥ 2 CNS hemorrhage events 
were to be reported as serious adverse events.  Grade ≥ 3 hemoptysis events were closely 
monitored for patients with squamous cell carcinoma; enrollment for this subpopulation was to 
be discontinued if the incidence was unacceptab le (for the stopping guidance, see the DMC 
charter).  Symptomatic Grade ≥  2 CNS hemorrhage events was cl osely monitored for patients 
with brain metastases treated prior to enrollment; accrual for this subpopulation was to be stopped if the incidence was unacceptable (for the stopping guidance, see the DMC charter).  Symptomatic Grade ≥ 3 hemorrhage events was closel y monitored for patients fully 
anticoagulated with low-molecular-weight heparin or fondaparinux; accrual for this 
subpopulation was to be stopped if the incidenc e of such events was unacceptable.   
Two interim analyses were conducted.  T he first interim analysis was conducted after 
123 patients had been enrolled and followed for at least 2 months.  Only safety data were 
assessed in this analysis.  The DMC reviewed the interim safety report on 10 July 2006 and recommended that the study continue as planned.  
The second interim analysis was conducted when approximately 67% of the required deaths 
(280 deaths) occurred.  Both safety and overall surv ival were assessed in this analysis.  Formal 
comparisons between the two treatment arms of the incidence of Grade 3 −5 and Grade 5 
hemoptysis were made.  If the incidence in the Tarceva + bevacizum ab arm was unacceptable, 
the study would have been stopped (for the stopping guidance, see the DMC charter).  The 
significance level for the overall survival comparison was determined using the Lan-DeMets 
alpha spending function with an O’Brien-Flem ing boundary of 0.0124 at 67% event time and 
0.0462 at the final analysis.  The overall survival result was not positive, so the study was continued until 417 deaths occurred. 
All summaries/analyses by treatment arm for the DMC review were performed by an 
independent Data Coordinating Center (DCC).  The study team remained blinded to the 
treatment assignment until study unblinding. 
Upon enactment of Amendment 6, safety data co llection will be restricted to the spontaneous 
reporting of serious adverse events via MedWat ch FDA 3500 forms and will not be captured 
in the CRF.

23/P OSI3364g-A6 1. BACKGROUND  
1.1 INTRODUCTION 
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death in North America (Pazdur et al. 
2004).  Eighty percent of lung cancer is non −small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and ~75% 
of patients with NSCLC present with advanced stage disease (unresectable or metastatic disease).  The overall 5-year survival rate for patients who develop lung 
cancer in the United States is 14%, having only slightly improved over the past 20 years 
(DeVita et al. 2001).  Patients who present with Stage IIIB and Stage IV disease have fairly equal and dismal prognoses, with 5-year  survival rates of 6% to 8% (Mountain 
1997).  Median survival for patients with metastatic NSCLC is historically ~4 months when treated with best supportive care (Bunn et al. 1998). 
Advances made in the last decade with the development of cytotoxic therapies for 
NSCLC have had little impact on overall survival in patients with advanced stage disease.  Platinum-based doublet chemotherapy (primarily carboplatin/paclitaxel in the 
United States) has remained the standard front-line treatment of advanced disease, with multiple randomized trials confirming a medi an survival of 8 months and response rates 
averaging 26% (Schiller et al. 2002).  Although newer chemotherapeutic agents (gemcitabine, vinorelbine, docetaxel) have been able to improve the quality of patients’ lives and prolong survival
 (Bunn et al. 1998; Bunn and Kelly 1998; Carney 1998; 
Sweeney and Sandler 1998), patients will event ually become refractory to or suffer 
dose-limiting toxicity from cytotoxic therapy. 
Therapeutic options for patients after relapse were limited to best supportive care or 
palliation until a trial comparing docetaxel with best supportive care showed that patients with NSCLC could benefit from second-line chemotherapy after cisplatin-based first-line regimens failed (Shepherd et al. 2000).  Benefit was measured in terms of prolongation of time to disease progression and overall su rvival, improvement in symptoms, reduction 
in the need for cancer-related medicines (in particular narcotic pai n medications), and 
improvement in several quality-of-life indices.  A second trial comparing docetaxel with ifosfamide or vinorelbine confirmed that docetaxel provides a benefit, with an improvement in 1-year survival (30% vs . 20%; Fossella et al. 2000).  The benefit of 
docetaxel monotherapy does not extend beyond second-line treatment.  Patients 
receiving docetaxel as third-line treatment  or beyond showed no prolongation of survival 
(Shepherd et al. 2000). 
In August 2004, another cytotoxic agent, pemetrexed (Alimta
®), received approval from 
the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as second-line therapy for patients with 
advanced NSCLC.  This approval was based on a randomized Phase III trial involving 571 patients that compared single-agent pemetrexed with single-agent docetaxel (Hanna et al. 2004).  Although this trial did not demonstrate statistical non-inferiority vs. docetaxel with respect to efficacy, the two agents produced similar response rates and 
 
Bevacizumab and Erlotinib—Genentech, Inc. 
24/P OSI3364g-A6 progression-free, median, and 1-year survival .  In addition, pemetrexed was associated 
with a lower incidence of toxicity than docetaxel. 
Despite these chemotherapeutic advances, many advanced stage patients are still 
unable to tolerate these cytotoxic therapies, and their prognosis remains poor.  Therefore, efforts are ongoing to develop effective regimens without significantly increasing toxicity.  Strategies that target tumor cell growth, such as inhibiting tumor angiogenesis or targeting the cell surface receptors responsible for modulating tumor cell proliferation, have the potential to demonstrate increased target specificity and therefore, presumably, less overall toxicity.  One of these agents, Tarceva
® (erlotinib), is 
a small molecule inhibitor of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), an important receptor for signaling tumor cell proliferation.  In the pivotal Phase III study BR.21, Tarceva was shown to improve overall survival in second- and third-line NSCLC patients versus placebo (Shepherd et al. 2004).  Furthermore, the trial showed that Tarceva was well tolerated and associated with a longer time to symptom deterioration compared with placebo.  Based on the data from this trial, in November 2004, the FDA approved Tarceva for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC following failure of at least one prior chemotherapy regimen. 
Bevacizumab, another targeted agent, is a recombinant monoclonal antibody that 
targets vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a critical factor in tumor angiogenesis (Ferrara and Davis-Smyth 1997).  Bevacizumab (Avastin
®) was approved by the FDA for 
first- and second-line treatment of metastatic colorectal carcinoma in combination with intravenous (IV) 5-fluorouracil −based chemotherapy in February 2004 and June 2006, 
respectively.  Bevacizumab also demonstrated encouraging activity in NSCLC in a randomized Phase II trial (AVF0757g) when administered in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel (Johnson et al. 2004).  In this study, patients receiving chemotherapy
 + bevacizumab had higher response rates, longer median time to 
progression (TTP), and a modest increase in survival.  Based on these data, the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) conducted a first-line Phase III trial (E4599) with 
carboplatin/paclitaxel
 ± bevacizumab in non-squamous NSCLC.  The results from this 
trial demonstrated that the combination provided a significant improvement in overall 
survival (Sandler et al. 2005).  (Please refer to the respective Investigator Brochures for additional information on the physical and pharmaceutical properties and a review of nonclinical studies for each agent.) 
This Phase III study was designed to evaluate the combination of the aforementioned 
targeted agents (the anti-angiogenic agent bevacizumab plus the EGFR inhibitor Tarceva) against Tarceva alone.  It was hypothesized that the potential complementary mechanisms of tumor control of these two agents, both active in NSCLC, might translate into added efficacy of the combination over single-agent Tarceva’s proven clinical benefit while maintaining tolerability.  In this trial, efficacy was assessed in terms of overall survival.  Efficacy was also evaluated in terms of progression-free survival (PFS), objective response rate (ORR), duration of objective response, and clinical benefit. 
 
Bevacizumab and Erlotinib—Genentech, Inc. 
25/P OSI3364g-A6 The final analysis of the BETA lung trial was conducted in October, 2008.  The trial did 
not demonstrate an improved ov erall survival for patients treated with Tarceva and 
bevacizumab compared with those treated with Tarceva and placebo.  However, there was evidence of clinical activity evid enced by improvements in PFS and objective 
response (see Appendix C). 
1.2 CLINICAL EXPERIENC E WITH BEVACIZUMAB 
Bevacizumab has been studied in at least 3500 patients in a number of Phase I, II, and III clinical trials.  These clinical trials have included patients with a number of tumor types, including colorectal, breast, lung, and renal carcinoma.  The following discussion summarizes bevacizumab’s safety profile and presents efficacy results pertinent to this trial.  Please refer to the Avastin
® Investigator Brochure or Package Insert for 
descriptions of all completed Phase I, II, and III trials. 
In a large Phase III study (AVF2107g) of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer, the 
addition of bevacizumab to irinotecan/5-fluorouracil/leucovorin (IFL) chemotherapy resulted in a clinically and statistically significant increase in duration of survival, with a hazard ratio (HR) of death of 0.660 (median survival 15.6 vs. 20.3 months; p
 < 0.0001).  
Similar increases were seen in PFS (6.2 vs. 10.6 months; p  < 0.0001), overall response 
rate (35% vs. 45%; p  < 0.0029), and duration of response (7.1 vs. 10.4 months; 
p < 0.0014) for the combination arm versus the chemotherapy only arm (Hurwitz et al. 
2004). 
Based on the survival advantage demonstr ated in Study AVF2107g, bevacizumab was 
designated for priority review and was approved by the U.S. FDA for first-line treatment 
in combination with IV 5-FU −based chemotherapy for patients with metastatic colorectal 
cancer (CRC). 
The approval of bevacizumab for the second-lin e treatment of metastatic colorectal 
carcinoma was based upon results of a randomized, controlled, multicenter, Phase III 
trial of 829 patients with advanced or metastatic CRC who had received previous treatment with irinotecan and 5-FU as init ial therapy for metastatic disease or as 
adjuvant therapy (Study E3200).  The st udy showed that patients who received 
bevacizumab plus the 5-FU-based chem otherapy regimen known as FOLFOX4 
(oxaliplatin/5 -FU/leucovorin) had a 25% reduction in the risk of death (the primary 
endpoint; hazard ratio of 0.75 [95% CI 0.63, 0.89], p
 = 0.001 stratified logrank test), which 
was equivalent to a 33% improvement in overall survival, compared with patients who received FOLFOX4 alone.  Median survival for patients receiving bevacizumab plus FOLFOX4 was 13.0 months, compared with 10. 8 months for those receiving FOLFOX4 
alone (Giantonia et al. 2005) 
In October of 2006, bevacizumab was appr oved for the first-line treatment of 
non-resectable, locally advanced, or metastatic non-squamous NSCLC.  This approval 
 
Bevacizumab and Erlotinib—Genentech, Inc. 
26/P OSI3364g-A6 was based on the results of the Eastern Cooperative Group (ECOG) Study 4599.  The 
results of this trial are described in Section 1.2.2  
In February 2008, bevacizumab given in combination with paclitaxel was approved for 
the first-line treatment of metastatic breast carcinoma.  This approval was based on the results of the ECOG Study 2100, a Phase III trial conducted in 722 patients.  In this trial, the combination of bevacizumab and paclitaxel increased PFS to 11.3 months compared 
to 5.8 months with paclitaxel alone (hazard ratio [HR], 0.48; P<
 .0001).  The combination 
was not associated with an improvement in overall survival.  The overall survival was 
26.5 months with bevacizumab and paclitaxel compared to 24.8 months for paclitaxel 
alone (HR, 0.87; P=0.14). 
1.2.1 Safety Profile  
In the Phase I and II studies, four potential bevacizumab-associated safety concerns were identified:  hypertension, proteinuria, thromboembolic events, and hemorrhage.  Completed Phase II and Phase III studies of bevacizumab have further defined the safety profile of this agent in patients with metastatic malignancies.  Also during the Phase III studies, three new possible bevacizumab-associated safety concerns were identified:  congestive heart failure in patients who had been exposed to anthracyclines, gastrointestinal perforations, and wound healing complications. 
Hypertension:   In Study AVF2107g, hypertension of any grade occurred in 22.4% of 
patients receiving IFL
 + bevacizumab compared with 8.3% receiving IFL  + placebo.  
National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (NCI-CTC) Grade 3 hypertension 
(requiring oral anti-hypertensive medication) wa s reported in 11.0% of patients receiving 
IFL  + bevacizumab compared with 2.3% of patients receiving IFL  + placebo.  The overall 
incidence of hypertension adverse events in Study AVF0757g was 17.6% (5.9% Grade 3) in the 15 mg/kg/q3 wk arm vs. 3.1% in the control arm.  Across clinical studies, the incidence of NCI-CTC Grade 3 or 4 hypertension ranged from 8% to 18%.  Oral medications have been used to manage the hypertension when indicated.  Grade 4 hypertensive events are rare; however, hy pertensive encephalopathy associated with 
fatal outcome has been reported.  In addition, reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome (RPLS) has been described in a ssociation with moderate hypertension 
(Glusker et al. 2006). 
Proteinuria:   Proteinuria, ranging from asymptomatic and transient events detected on 
routine dipstick urinalysis to nephrotic syndrome, has been seen in all clinical trials to 
date.  The majority of proteinuria events have been Grade 1 or 2.  In Studies AVF0757g and ECOG 3200, the incidence of NCI-CTC Grade 3 or 4 proteinuria, characterized as
 > 3.5 gm/24 hr, ranged up to 1.8% in bevacizumab -treated patients.  
Gastrointestinal perforation : Gastrointestinal perforation was not seen in the 
bevacizumab Phase I or II clinical trials; how ever, in the Phase III metastatic CRC trials, 
the incidence of gastrointestinal perforation, fistula formation, and/or intra-abdominal 
 
Bevacizumab and Erlotinib—Genentech, Inc. 
27/P OSI3364g-A6 abscess in patients receiving bevacizumab was 2.4%.  These episodes occurred at 
various timepoints during treatment.  The typical presentation was reported as abdominal pain associated with symptoms such as constipation and emesis. 
In post-marketing clinical studies and reports, gastrointestinal perforation, fistula 
formation and/or intra-abdominal abscess occurred in patients receiving bevacizumab for colorectal and for other types of cancer.  Of the reported events, approximately 30% were fatal.  Patients with gastrointestinal perforation, regardless of underlying cancer, typically presented with abdominal pain, nausea, and fever.  Events were reported at various timepoints during treatment ranging fr om 1 week to greater than 1 year from 
initiation of bevacizumab, with most events occurring within the first 50 days. 
Hemorrhage:   In the Phase II NSCLC trial (Johnson et al. 2004), 6 of 
66 bevacizumab-treated patients experienced life-threatening hemoptysis or 
hematemesis.  Four of these events were fatal.  An analysis of possible risk factors for life-threatening bleeding identified squamous cell  histology (4 of 6 bleeds occurred in 
patients with squamous cell histology, whereas only 13 of 66 treated patients had squamous cell histology) and centrally locat ed cavitary and/or necrotic lesions as 
potential risk factors. 
At the ASCO Annual Meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) in 
2006, a retrospective analysis of clinical and radiographic risk factors associated with the development of pulmonary hemorrhage in bevacizumab-treated NSCLC patients was reported (Sandler et al. 2006).  The authors suggested a potential association of pulmonary hemorrhage with hemoptysis and tumor cavitation.  However, the number of cases was too small to make a conclusive statement. 
On this basis, the enrollment of patients with squamous cell NSCLC in this trial is limited 
to those with lesions at low risk for life-threatening hemorrhage.  Patients at low risk are defined as those with peripheral lung lesions or extrathoracic lesions.  Patients with squamous histology with lesions other than peripheral are not recommended for study participation.  The definition for a peripheral lung lesion is given in Section 4.1.3  
Congestive heart failure:  Congestive heart failure (CHF), defined as NCI-CTC Grade 2 −4 left ventricular dysfunction, has been reported in patients receiving 
bevacizumab.  The risk of CHF appears to be higher in patients receiving bevacizumab who have received prior or concurrent anthracyclines.  Prior radiation therapy to the chest wall may also increase the risk of CHF in these patients.   
Additional safety signals:   Other safety concerns seen to date—asthenia, pain, 
headache, fever, chills, rash, infection, epistaxis, and mouth ulceration—are not thought 
to be clinically significant because they rare ly or never required treatment or study drug 
discontinuation.

1.2.2 Efficacy Results in Non −Small Cell Lung Cancer  
In a randomized, Phase II study in advanced NSCLC (Study AVF0757g) (Johnson et al. 
2004), 99 patients with Stage IIIB, Stage IV, or recurrent NSCLC were randomized to receive either paclitaxel/carboplat in alone or paclitaxel/carboplatin
 + bevacizumab (either 
at 7.5 mg/kg or 15 mg/kg every 3 weeks).  In that study, the best confirmed response rate was higher for the high-dose bevacizumab arm compared with the control arm (investigator assessment, 32% vs. 19%).  Time to disease progression was also higher for the high-dose bevacizumab arm (inves tigator assessment; median 225 days vs. 
129 days for the control).  When patients wi th squamous cell NSCLC histology were 
excluded, the confirmed response rate, time to  progression, and overall survival were 
higher for high-dose bevacizumab compared with the control arm.  Based on these results, ECOG conducted a first-line Phase III trial with paclitaxel/carboplatin
 + bevacizumab in non-squamous cell NSCLC, ECOG Study 4599.  
An interim analysis of the data from this trial met its primary efficacy endpoint of improving overall survival, or a reduction in the risk of death, compared with chemotherapy alone.  The rate of bevacizu mab-related pulmonary hemorrhage in ECOG 
Study 4599 was 1.8% (Sandler 2005). 
The Avastin
® in Lung (AVAIL) trial, a Phase III trial in which 1043 patients were enrolled, 
supported the results of ECOG 4599 by demonstrating an improved PFS for patients 
randomized to receive bevacizumab at 1 of 2 doses (7.5 mg/kg or 15 mg/kg) with chemotherapy, gemcitabine, and cisplatinum , compared with chemotherapy alone.  
The median PFS was 6.7 months in the 7.5 mg/kg bevacizumab arm and 6.5 months in the 15 mg/kg bevacizumab arm compared with 6.1 months in the chemotherapy alone arm.  The hazard ratios were 0.75 (P = .002) for the lower dose and 0.82 (P = .03) for 
the higher dose.  
Please refer to Section 1.4 and the Avastin Investigator Brochure or Package Insert for 
additional details regarding the efficacy of bevacizumab in treating NSCLC. 
1.3 CLINICAL EXPERIENCE WITH TARCEVA 
Tarceva has been studied in at least 4000 patients in a number of Phase I, II, and III clinical trials.  The following section summarizes Tarceva’s safety profile and presents efficacy results pertinent to this trial.  Please refer to the Tarceva
® Investigator Brochure 
or Package Insert (see Appendix B) for descriptions of all completed Phase I, II, and III 
trials. 
1.3.1 Safety Profile  
Multiple Phase II and III trials of Tarceva have been conducted in patients with advanced, refractory malignancies.  Of the 731 NSCLC patients enrolled in the second- 
 
Bevacizumab and Erlotinib—Genentech, Inc. 
29/P OSI3364g-A6 and third-line trial of single-agent Tarceva versus placebo, nearly 500 received Tarceva 
at 150 mg/day.  Seventy-five percent of the patients experienced rash (8% were Grade 3 rash).  Gastrointestinal events also occurred frequently; these included diarrhea (54%, of which 6% were Grade 3). 
Rash:  A papular, pustular rash manifesting most often on the face and upper trunk was 
common across all studies, but rash was rarely the cause of study drug discontinuation.  The median time to onset of rash was 8 days.  The rash may be associated with erythema, pain, pruritus, dryness, and less commonly, stomatitis and keratitis. 
Diarrhea:  Diarrhea was the dose-limiting toxicity at 200 mg/day, but it is generally mild 
(Grade 1 or 2) and manageable at 150 mg/day.  The overall incidence of diarrhea in the 
Phase III study of single-agent Tarceva in NSCLC (Study BR.21) was 54%, of which 6% was Grade 3 or 4. 
Rare cases of acute renal failure or renal insufficiency (including fatalities) with or 
without hypokalemia have been reported.  Some have been secondary to severe dehydration due to diarrhea, vomiting, and/or anorexia, while others have been confounded by concurrent chemotherapy use.  Periodic monitoring of renal function and 
serum electrolytes is recommended in patients at risk of dehydration. 
Interstitial lung disease:  Non-fatal and fatal cases of interstitial lung disease (ILD) have 
been reported in association with the use of Tarceva in patients with NSCLC.  The 
diagnosis of ILD is rarely definitive in cancer patients, who often have concurrent, confounding medical problems.  However, a broad search (using 24 separate terms felt to be possibly reflective of a diagnosis of ILD) of the global safety database in April 2004 has identified 23 cases of possible ILD, irrespective of investigator-assessed causality.  With at least 4000 patients previously treated with Tarceva, this represents a reporting incidence of 0.70%.  Of these 23 cases, 16 have been assessed by the investigator as possibly related to study drug. 
Hepatotoxicity:   Cases of hepatic failure and hepatorenal syndrome, including fatalities, 
have been reported during use of Tarceva, particularly in patients with baseline hepatic 
impairment.  These reports have been collected during postmarketing surveillance.  The incidence appears to be rare. 
Drug interactions:   Tarceva is 92%–95% protein bound and metabolized by hepatic 
cytochromes CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 and pulmonary cytochrome CYP1A1.  Therefore, a 
potential for drug–drug interaction exists when Tarceva is co-administered with drugs that are highly protein bound or that are CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers.  In addition to these possibilities, altered coagulation parameters have been reported in patients receiving Tarceva in combination with warfarin. 
 
Bevacizumab and Erlotinib—Genentech, Inc. 
30/P OSI3364g-A6 Other serious and nonserious adverse event s have been reported. Details are provided 
in the Tarceva® Investigator Brochure and Package Insert (see Appendix B). 
1.3.2 Efficacy Results in Non −Small Cell Lung Cancer  
Study BR.21, an international study conducted by the NCIC-CTG, randomized 
previously treated patients with advanced or metastatic NSCLC in a 2:1 ratio to single-agent Tarceva at 150 mg/day versus placebo (Shepherd et al. 2004).  Enrollment was completed in January 2003, with a total of 731 patients enrolled. 
The trial met its primary endpoint of improving overall survival in second- and third-line 
NSCLC patients.  Patients receiving Tarceva had a median survival of 6.7 months compared with 4.7 months for those re ceiving placebo (a 42.5% improvement; 
HR
 = 0.73; p  = 0.001).  The trial also met its secondary endpoints, including 
improvements in time to symptom deterioration, PFS, and ORR.  The ORR was 8.9% in Tarceva-treated patients versus <
 0.9% in placebo-treated patients. 
Two other Phase III randomized studies in first-line NSCLC patients evaluated Tarceva in combination with platinum-based doublet chemotherapy.  A total of 1059 (1079 randomized) previously untreated patients rece ived carboplatin/paclitaxel with either 
Tarceva or placebo in the TRIBUTE study (OSI2298g), conducted in the United States (Herbst et al. 2004).  An additional 1159 (1172 randomized) patients received cisplatin/gemcitabine plus either Tarceva or placebo in the TALENT study (BO16411), 
which was conducted in 27 countries in Europe and other locations outside of the United States (Gatzemeier et al. 2004).  Neither study met its primary endpoint of improved overall survival or its secondary endpoints of  improved time to disease progression and 
overall response rate. 
Preliminary data suggest that patients with no prior smoking history respond particularly 
well to EGFR inhibitors, as assessed by both response and survival.  The TRIBUTE study collected smoking history at entry.  “Never-smokers” randomized to receive Tarceva with chemotherapy had a median survival of 22 months as opposed to 10 months for never-smokers in the placebo arm (Miller et al. 2004). 
Analysis of the impact of EGFR expression status on the treatment effect on clinical 
outcome of patients receiving Tarceva is limited because EGFR status is known for only one third of patients enrolled in Study BR.21.  For this study, positive EGFR expression status was defined as having ≥
 10% of cells staining for EGFR in contrast to the 1% 
cutoff specified in the DAKO EGFR pharmDx ™ kit instructions. 
Tarceva prolonged survival in the EGFR-positive subgroup (n  = 185; HR  = 0.68; 95% 
confidence interval [CI]  = 0.49, 0.94) and the subgroup whose EGFR status was 
unmeasured (n  = 405; HR  = 0.77; 95% CI  = 0.61, 0.98), but did not appear to have an 
effect on survival in the EGFR-negative subgroup (n  = 141; HR  = 0.93; 95% CI  = 0.63, 
1.36).  However, the CIs for the EGFR-positive, unmeasured, and EGFR-negative 
 
Bevacizumab and Erlotinib—Genentech, Inc. 
31/P OSI3364g-A6 subgroups are wide and overlap, so that a survival benefit due to Tarceva in the 
EGFR-negative subgroup cannot be excluded.  Tumor responses were observed in all EGFR subgroups:  11.3% in the EGFR-positive subgroup, 9.5% in the EGFR unmeasured group, and 3.8% in the EGFR-negative subgroup.   
An improvement in PFS was demonstrat ed in the EGFR-positive subgroup (HR
 = 0.49; 
95% CI  = 0.35, 0.68), the EGFR unmeasured subgroup (HR  = 0.60; 95% CI  = 0.47, 0.75), 
and less certain in the EGFR-negative subgroup (HR  = 0.80; 95% CI  = 0.55, 1.16; US PI). 
1.3.3 EGFR Mutations in Non −Small Cell Lung Cancer  
The recent identification of mutations within the EGFR in the tumor tissue of a subset of 
patients with NSCLC and the association of these mutations with sensitivity to gefitinib (Lynch et al. 2004; Paez et al. 2004) support the hypothesis that these are activating mutations that also render the tumors sensitive to the effects of EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors.  For the two reports pooled, mutated EGFR was observed in 13 of 14 patients who responded to gefitinib and in none of the 11 patients who were treated and did not respond.  The relationship of mutation to prolonged stable disease or survival duration has not been prospectively evaluated.  Patients were selectively identified for this analysis based on a rapid or dramatic response.  Data from large numbers of unselected patients prospectively enrolled in clinical trials are needed to more fully understand the clinical significance of these mutations. 
The association between the presence of EGFR mutations and clinical response was 
also seen with Tarceva, as reported in an analysis of patients enrolled in the TRIBUTE study (Eberhard et al. 2004).  Of the 228 patients with available tissue, 29 had evidence of EGFR mutations, for a prevalence of 12.7%.  Among these 29 patients, the 15 who received chemotherapy
 + Tarceva had a trend toward prolonged TTP and improved 
response rate compared with the 14 who received chemotherapy only (p  = 0.092 and 
p < 0.01, respectively).  Patients with EGFR-mutant tumors, irrespective of whether they 
received Tarceva or placebo with chemother apy, survived longer (m edian survival not 
reached) than patients with wild-type EGFR (MS 9.6 and 11.7 months, p  < 0.001), 
suggesting that EGFR mutation is a positive prognostic factor independent of EGFR inhibitor therapy. 
The improved TTP and response rate have not translated into improved survival for 
patients with EGFR-mutant tumors receiving chemotherapy
 + Tarceva compared with 
patients receiving chemotherapy alone (p  = 0.958).  However, the number of patients 
with available tissue was small, and the duration of follow-up was short compared with 
the longer survival of all patients with EGFR mutations irrespective of treatment arm. 
1.4 BEVACIZUMAB AND TARC EVA COMBINATION STUDIES 
The strategy of combining therapeutic agents in cancer treatments has been successful in multiple tumor types, including NSCLC.  A new series of clinical studies are now being designed and conducted to evaluate the combination of bevacizumab with Tarceva, 
 
Bevacizumab and Erlotinib—Genentech, Inc. 
32/P OSI3364g-A6 particularly in NSCLC and renal cell carcinoma.  This approach has scientific rationale 
because the two agents target different pathways involved in tumor growth, and nonclinical studies in xenograft models have demonstrated that the combination of bevacizumab and Tarceva results in greater efficacy than either agent alone (data on file, provided by , Genentech, Inc.).  Furthermore, because little to no overlap in toxicity profile between the two agents has been observed to date, the combination is expected to be well tolerated and may provide greater benefit than either agent alone for patients who are unable to receive cytotoxic therapy.  
OSI2486s:   Study OSI2486s is a recently completed investigator-sponsored Phase I/II 
study (OSI2486s) evaluating the combination of bevacizumab and Tarceva in patients 
with relapsed or refractory NSCLC of non-squamous histology (Herbst et al. 2005).  The Phase I portion of the study evaluated three dose combinations to determine the tolerability and pharmacokinetic profile of each agent when combined.  Patients whose disease had progressed following at leas t one chemotherapy regimen for Stage IIIB/IV 
disease were treated with 100 mg/day Tarceva
 + 7.5 mg/kg bevacizumab, 100 mg/day 
Tarceva  + 15 mg/kg bevacizumab, or 150 mg/day Tarceva  + 15 mg/kg bevacizumab (with 
bevacizumab administered every 3 weeks in all regimens).  A total of 12 patients were 
enrolled and treated in the Phase I portion (3, 3, and 6 per cohort, respectively).  No dose-limiting toxicities were observed, and the pharmacokinetic profiles of both drugs did not appear to be affected by the combination.  As a consequence, the recommended Phase II dose was established as 150 mg/day Tarceva
 + 15 mg/kg bevacizumab every 
3 weeks, and 28 additional patients were subsequently treated with these doses. 
A total of 40 patients were enrolled in the Phase I and II portions, with 34 patients 
treated with full doses of both agents.  Patient characteristics were as follows:  median age 59 years (range:  36–72 years), 21 female/ 19 male, 30 patients with adenocarcinoma histology, 9 patients with no prior smoking history, 22 patients who received two or more prior regimens, and 3 patients who received four or more prior regimens.  The most commonly reported adverse events were rash, diarrhea, and proteinuria.  Importantly, there were no reports of hemoptysis.  Preliminary data indicated no pharmacokinetic interaction between these two agents.  The observed response rate was 20%, with a disease control rate (partial response and stable disease) of 85% and median overall survival of 12.6 months.  Based on the data from this single-arm, Phase I/II study, the combination of bevacizumab and Tarceva is well tolerated at maximum doses.   
The combination has encouraging activity, supporting a larger, controlled study 
to assess the efficacy and tolerability of the regimen. 
OSI2950g:   Study OSI2950g is a completed Genentech-sponsored, Phase II, 
multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled study evaluating the efficacy (based on 
PFS) of combining bevacizumab with docetaxel, premetrexed, or Tarceva relative to docetaxel monotherapy in patients with prev iously treated advanced NSCLC.  Eligible 

 
Bevacizumab and Erlotinib—Genentech, Inc. 
33/P OSI3364g-A6 patients have histologically confirmed non-squamous NSCLC and have experienced 
disease progression during or following one platinum-based regimen for advanced stage 
disease (Stage IIIB or IV).  Additional eligibility criteria include no previous anti-
angiogenesis agents or EGFR inhibitors, an ECOG performance status of 0 or 1, and no active central nervous system metastases.  Patients are randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to one of three treatment arms: 
• Arm 1:  docetaxel or premetrexed
 + placebo 
• Arm 2:  docetaxel or premetrexed  + bevacizumab 
• Arm 3:  bevacizumab  + Tarceva 
The primary results of Study OSI2950g were presented at the ASCO Annual Meeting 
in 2006.  The observed data favored the addition of bevacizumab to either chemotherapy or erlotinib over chemotherapy alone in the treatment of relapsed NSCLC.  The authors went on to note that the trial was not powered to detect such a difference.  Importantly, no new or unexpected safety signals for bevacizumab or Tarceva were 
noted during the trial.  The toxicity profile of the bevacizumab
 +  erlotinib combination 
showed a lower incidence of serious adverse  events when compared with both of the 
chemotherapy-containing groups.  The authors’ fi nal statement was a call for a definitive 
Phase III trial of this combination (Fehrenbacher et al. 2006). 
AVF3120s:  Study AVF3120s is an investigator-sponsored Phase II study currently 
being conducted to evaluate the combination of 10 mg/kg bevacizumab every 2 weeks
 + 150 mg/day Tarceva in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma 
(Hainsworth et al. 2004).  Eligible patients have metastatic clear-cell renal cell carcinoma and no more than one previous systemic chemotherapy regimen.  Patients are evaluated for response after 8 weeks.  At that time, patients with a response or stable disease continue treatment for 12 months or until tumor progression.  The preliminary efficacy data from this single-arm, Phase II study of 58 evaluable patients suggest a response rate of 25%, a 1-year PFS of 43%, and an 18-month survival of 60%.  The most commonly observed toxicities include rash, diarrhea, proteinuria, and bleeding (usually Grade 1 or 2). 
AVF2938g:  Study AVF2938g, a Genentech-sponsored, Phase II, randomized study 
conducted to evaluate the combination of bevacizumab
 + Tarceva versus bevacizumab 
alone in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma, did not demonstrate clinical benefit for those patients receiving the bevacizumab
 + Tarceva combination.  Similarly, 
there was no increase in toxicity in those patients treated with the combination (Bukowski et al. 2006). 
2. OBJECTIVES  
2.1 PRIMARY OBJECTIVE 
The primary objective of this Phase III study was to evaluate the efficacy of combining bevacizumab with Tarceva (erlotinib) relative to Tarceva monotherapy in patients 
 
Bevacizumab and Erlotinib—Genentech, Inc. 
34/P OSI3364g-A6 receiving second-line therapy for advanced NSCLC.  Efficacy will be assessed by 
measuring overall survival. 
The addition of bevacizumab to erlotinib in the BETA lung study was not associated with 
an improvement in overall survival.  However, bevacizumab when combined with erlotinib improved PFS and ORR, demonstrat ing evidence of clinical activity.   
2.2 SECONDARY OBJECTIVES 
The secondary objectives of this Phase III study were as follows: 
• To evaluate the safety of combining bevacizumab with Tarceva in patients with 
previously treated advanced NSCLC, including patients with squamous cell 
carcinoma, patients with treated brain metastases, and patients receiving full-dose 
anticoagulation with low-molecular-weight heparin or fondaparinux. 
Note:  See Section 4.1.2 for the eligibility criteria regarding squamous cell carcinoma patients. 
Note: Upon enactment of Amendment 6, safety data collection will be restricted 
to the reporting of serious adverse events via MedWatch FDA 3500 forms (Appendix  D) and will not be captured in the CRF. 
• To evaluate the efficacy of combining bevacizumab with Tarceva relative to Tarceva 
monotherapy in patients with previously treated advanced NSCLC, as measured by 
PFS, ORR, and duration of response 
• To evaluate the pharmacokinetic behavior of Tarceva and the combination of 
bevacizumab with Tarceva in a subset of patients with previously treated advanced 
NSCLC 
• To evaluate the association of survival, PFS, and treatment effect with markers of 
epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression, as measured by immunohistochemistry (IHC), EGFR gene copy number measured by fluorescence 
in situ hybridization (FISH), and other molecular markers of EGFR pathway activity 
in archival tissue samples 
 
3. STUDY DESIGN  
3.1 DESCRIPTION OF THE STUDY 
This is a Phase III, multicenter, placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized study.  Six 
hundred thirty-six patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of two treatment arms: 
• Arm 1:  Tarceva  + placebo 
• Arm 2:  Tarceva  + bevacizumab 
 
Treatment assignment to study drug (bev acizumab or placebo) was blinded for 
Genentech, the investigator, and the patient.  All patients had to have cytologically or 
histologically confirmed NSCLC and had to consent to allow analysis of their archival 
 
Bevacizumab and Erlotinib—Genentech, Inc. 
35/P OSI3364g-A6 diagnostic tissue, if available.  For safety reasons, patients with squamous cell histology 
were allowed to enroll only if they had limited disease that placed them at low risk for 
life-threatening hemorrhage.  Their lung lesions had to be peripheral or their disease extrathoracic.  Patients with brain metastases were allowed to enroll only if their brain metastases had been previously treated and they are not receiving dexamethasone. 
Furthermore, all patients must have experienced disease progression (clinical or radiographic progression, as assessed by the investigator) during or following standard first-line chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy for NSCLC.  (Note:  Patients receiving neo-adjuvant and adjuvant therapy for Stage I–IIIA disease prior to their first-line regimen were eligible for study participation provided they also received first-line therapy 
[for unresectable, metastatic disease] and demonstrated progression during or after that first-line therapy.) 
Patients were allowed to remain in the treatment phase of the study until documented 
radiographic or clinical disease progression, or until unmanageable toxicity (in the latter case and if the causal drug is bevacizumab/placebo, Tarceva may be continued until documented disease progression or unmanageable toxicity).  Patients have been followed for survival until death, loss to follow-up, or study termination by Genentech.   
A data monitoring committee (DMC) periodically reviewed safety data for all patients, for 
patients with brain metastases treated prior to enrollment, and for patients with squamous cell carcinoma throughout the study, including monthly serious adverse event 
reviews.  This function was carried out by the Genentech Medical Monitor after 
November 2008.  
Two interim analyses were conducted during the study.  The first was conducted after 
123 patients had been enrolled and followed for at least 2 months.  Only safety data were assessed in this analysis.  The DMC reviewed the interim safety report on 10 July 2006 and recommended that the study continue as planned.  The second interim analysis was conducted when approximately 67% of the required deaths (280 deaths) occurred.  Both safety and overall surviv al were assessed in this analysis. The DMC 
reviewed the interim report on 7 February 2008 and recommended that the study continue as planned.  The final analysis was conducted in October 2008 and the results presented publicly in November 2008.  See Appendix C. 
The study is represented schematically  in Figure 1 .  Study assessments and

3.2 RATIONALE FOR STUDY DESIGN 
The rationale for this study design is based on a hypothesis that combining bevacizumab 
with Tarceva should result in improved efficacy compared with Tarceva monotherapy in the setting of advanced NSCLC after failure of standard first-line chemotherapy.  The proposed design included a placebo for bevacizumab in order to eliminate reporting and ascertainment bias in the final data analysis.  The primary objective of this study was overall survival. 
The control arm of Tarceva alone is FDA approved for the treatment of patients with 
locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC after failure of at least one prior chemotherapy regimen, based on data from Study BR.21 (see Section 1.3 or Shepherd et al. 2004).  Based on data from Study OSI2486s (see Section 1.4 or Herbst et al. 2005), it was hypothesized that the combination treatment arm would be well tolerated and provide greater benefit than Tarceva alone.  Intensive pharmacokinetic analyses were performed in this study to evaluate the pharmacokinetic behavior of Tarceva and of the combination of the two agents.   
Tumor biopsy material from patients enrolled in this study was requested in order to 
measure selected markers of EGFR and/or VEGF pathway activity that are thought to play an important role in clinical outcome. 
Study OSI3364g did not include a chemot herapy arm, as the comparison of 
chemotherapy versus Tarceva in the treatment of second-line NSCLC is being 
addressed in other clinical trials.

37/P OSI3364g-A6 3.3 OUTCOME MEASURES 
3.3.1 Primary Efficacy Outcome Measure  
The primary efficacy outcome measure for this study was overall survival, defined as the 
period from the date of randomization until the date of patient death from any cause. 
The addition of bevacizumab to erlotinib in the BETA lung study was not associated with 
an improvement in overall survival.  However, bevacizumab when combined with erlotinib improved PFS and ORR, demonstrat ing evidence of clinical activity.  See 
Appendix C. 
3.3.2 Secondary Efficacy Outcome Measures  
The secondary efficacy outcome measures were as follows: 
• PFS, defined as the time from randomization to documented disease progression, 
as determined by the investigator using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid 
Tumors (RECIST), or death on study tr eatment, whichever occurs first 
• Objective response, as determined by the investigator using RECIST 
• Duration of objective response, defined as the period from the date of initial partial 
or complete response (as determined by the investigator using RECIST) until the 
date of disease progression or death from any cause on study treatment 
• Evaluation of the relationship between molecular exploratory markers and efficacy 
outcomes 
 
3.3.3 Pharmacokinetic Outcome Measures  
The pharmacokinetic outcome measures for erlotinib and its metabolite (OSI-420) were 
as follows: 
• Maximum concentration at steady state ( Cmax,ss)  
• Time of the maximum concentration at steady state (T max,ss) 
• Minimum concentration at steady state ( Cmin,ss)  
• Apparent clearance at steady state 
• Area under the erlotinib time −concentration curve (AUC 0–tau) 
 
The pharmacokinetic outcome measures for bevacizumab were as follows: 
• Maximum concentration ( Cmax) 
• Minimum concentration ( Cmin) 
 
3.3.4 Safety Outcome Measures  
The safety outcome measures for this study were the following: • Incidence and severity of adverse events and serious adverse events 
• Changes in laboratory values  
 
Bevacizumab and Erlotinib—Genentech, Inc. 
38/P OSI3364g-A6 Patient safety after Amendment 6 will be restricted to the spontaneous reporting of 
serious adverse events via Me dWatch FDA 3500 forms and will not be captured in the 
CRF.  
3.4 SAFETY PLAN 
Upon enactment of Amendment 6, data collection will be restricted to reporting of 
serious adverse events  via MedWatch FDA 3500 forms (not in the CRF), and handled 
according to instructions in Section 5.4. SAE data will be collected via the safety database only.  Prior to Amendment 6, the safety plan was as below. 
See Section 4.3.4 and Section 5 for complete details of the safety evaluation for this 
study. 
A number of measures have been taken to ensure the safety of patients participating in 
this study.  These measures were addressed through the exclusion criteria (see Section 4.1.3) and routine monitoring as follows. 
Patients enrolled in this study were evaluated clinically and with standard laboratory 
tests before and at regular intervals during t heir participation in this study.  Safety 
evaluations consisting of medical interviews, recording of concomitant medications and adverse events, physical examinations, blood pressure, and laboratory measurements 
(performed by local laboratories, see Section 4.5 and Appendix A) have been conducted.  Patients have been evaluated for adverse events (all grades), serious adverse events, and adverse events requiring study drug interruption or discontinuation at each study visit while on study drug.  Patients discontinued from the treatment phase of the study for any reason were evaluated ~30 days (28− 42 days) after the decision to 
discontinue treatment (see Section 4.5.3).  Patients with an ongoing Grade 4 or serious adverse event at the time of discontinuation from study treatment were followed until the 
event is resolved or determined to be irreversible by the investigator (se e Section 4.5.3). 
Specific monitoring procedures were as follows: 
• Hypertension was monitored through routine evaluation of blood pressure. 
• In patients with bleeding, a hemostasis evaluation was performed as clinically 
indicated.  In patients with hemoptysis, bevacizumab should be permanently 
discontinued and protocol guidelines followed (see Section 4.3.4  and Table 2 ).  
Early use of bronchoscopy to identify the site of bleeding should also be considered. 
• Patients with a history of brain metastases were monitored for the development of 
symptomatic Grade  ≥ 2 CNS hemorrhage (NCI CTCAE, Version 3.0).  Symptomatic 
is defined as clinical symptoms that are determined by the investigator to be directly 
referable to a CNS hemorrhage.  Bevacizumab should be discontinued and protocol 
guidelines followed in patients who develop symptomatic Grade ≥ 2 CNS 
hemorrhage (see Section 4.3.4  and Table 2 ). 
 
Bevacizumab and Erlotinib—Genentech, Inc. 
39/P OSI3364g-A6 • Patients requiring full-dose anticoagulation could be treated with 
low-molecular-weight heparin or fondaparinux; these patients were and have been 
monitored for Grade ≥  3 hemorrhage events.  Full-dose anticoagulation with 
warfarin is prohibited; however, prophylactic doses were allowable. 
• Bevacizumab should be discontinued and protocol guidelines followed in patients 
who develop symptomatic Grade ≥  2 CNS hemorrhage or Grade ≥  3 hemorrhage 
(see Section 4.3.4  and Table 2).   
• Because of the potential for drug–drug interaction between Tarceva and warfarin, 
patients who received concomitant prophylact ic/low-dose warfarin therapy were to 
be monitored closely for INR changes or bleeding. 
• Chronic use of full-dose nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) was not 
allowed while on study treatment.  If required, the patient must be discontinued from bevacizumab/placebo. 
• Aspirin up to, but not exceeding, 325 mg per day could be given to patients at high 
risk for arterial thromboembolic disease.  Patients developing signs or symptoms of 
arterial thromboembolic events (see Table 2)  while on study treatment were asked 
to discontinue bevacizumab/placebo. 
• Proteinuria was monitored through regular urinalysis and urinary protein to 
creatinine ratio.  Screening for proteinuria at ex-U.S. sites was performed with a 
urine dipstick (patients found to have ≥ 3+ proteinuria by dipstick had to undergo a 
24-hour urine collection) 
• Symptoms consistent with ILD, such as new onset dyspnea, cough, or fever without 
an obvious cause were to be evaluated.  In the event that ILD was suspected, study treatment was to be discontinued and the patient given appropriate medical management.  Although there is no proven t herapy, systemic corticosteroids are 
often provided.  Tarceva should not be restarted in patients suspected of having drug-related ILD. 
• NCI-CTC Grade 3 conjunctivitis and keratitis have been reported infrequently in 
patients receiving Tarceva therapy.  Patients were asked to seek medical advice promptly if they experienced eye irritation during Tarceva therapy. 
 
See Section 4.3.4 for detailed instructions about the management of study drug-related 
toxicities.  The DMC monitored the safety of this study by reviewing serious adverse events every month and during the two interim analyses.  Members of the DMC were external to Genentech and followed a charter that outlines the Committee’s composition and the members’ roles and responsibilities. 
3.5 CONTROL GROUP 
The control group consisted of patients receiving Tarceva in combination with placebo (Arm 1). 
 
Bevacizumab and Erlotinib—Genentech, Inc. 
40/P OSI3364g-A6 3.6 MINIMIZATION OF BIAS 
To reduce bias, patients were randomized to two treatment arms (Tarceva + placebo 
and Tarceva +  bevacizumab) using an interactive voice response system (IVRS).  
Genentech, the investigator, and the patient was blinded to treatment assignment of 
bevacizumab versus placebo. 
3.7 ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
The prognosis for patients with previously treated advanced NSCLC is poor, with a median survival of ~4 months among untreated patients (Bunn et al. 1998).  Single-agent Tarceva showed a significant survival benefit in Study BR.21 (Shepherd et al. 2004); therefore, patients receiving Tarceva + placebo will receive an FDA-approved 
treatment with proven efficacy in this setting. 
A quality-of-life assessment using the European Organization for Research and 
Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QLQ-C30 and the lung cancer module QLQ-LC13 tools 
was an integral part of Study BR.21.  Patients treated with Tarceva monotherapy had a significantly longer time to symptom deter ioration, cough, dyspnea, and pain compared 
with patients receiving placebo. 
A survival benefit for bevacizumab in t he front-line treatment of non-squamous cell 
NSCLC was demonstrated in ECOG Study 4599 (Sandler et al. 2005).  A Phase I/II 
investigator-sponsored study of Tarceva + bevacizumab in non–squamous cell NSCLC 
(Herbst et al. 2005) and preliminary result s from Study OSI2950g (Fehrenbacher et al. 
2006) suggest that this benefit may extend to patients treated in the second-line setting. 
Study OSI3364g was designed to test the hypothesis that the addition of bevacizumab 
increases the survival benefit of Tarceva. 
In the Phase II NSCLC trial, AVF0757g, 6 of the 66 bevacizumab-treated patients 
experienced life-threatening hemoptysis or hematemesis (Johnson et al. 2004).  Four of these events were fatal.  Of these patients, 4 had squamous cell histology.  This corresponded to a 31% rate of hemorrhage (4 of 13 patients) in patients with squamous cell disease.   
A case-control evaluation performed to determine which clinical and/or radiographic 
factors contributed to these events concluded that squamous cell histology and bevacizumab treatment were the principal risk factors for major pulmonary hemorrhage 
(Novotny et al. 2001). 
In Study E4599 (the Phase III trial of bevacizumab in first-line NSCLC patients), 
excluding those with predominant squamous histology, 10 of 427 patients (2.3%) in the bevacizumab +  chemotherapy arm experienced Grade 3 −5 pulmonary hemorrhage 
compared with 2 of 441 patients (0.5%) in the chemotherapy-alone arm.  
 
Bevacizumab and Erlotinib—Genentech, Inc. 
41/P OSI3364g-A6 Five of the 10 events in the bevacizumab + chemotherapy arm occurred within 9 weeks 
of treatment initiation.  The remaining events occurred at Week 15 or later.  The two 
events occurring in the chemotherapy-alone arm occurred at Week 16 or later.  A retrospective analysis of pulmonary hemorrhage cases from Studies E4599 and AVF0757g did not conclusively identify clinical or radiographic criteria associated with an increased risk for severe pulmonary hemorrhage.  Hemoptysis and tumor cavitation were felt to be potentially associated. 
Based on the case-control analysis from Study AVF0757g, squamous NSCLC was the 
principal risk factor for severe pulmonary hemorrhage.  Patients with squamous NSCLC have been excluded from subsequent clinical tr ials with bevacizumab, thus limiting 
clinical experience in this setting. 
Of the 145,000 patients diagnosed with NSCLC annually, 20% −30% will have squamous 
cell histology.  Treatment of these patients remains an area of significant unmet need 
(Fraire 1996; Hammar 1993; Linnoila and Aisner 1995). 
The risk for pulmonary hemorrhage in patients with squamous cell NSCLC, 
demonstrated in Study AVF0757g, may not be uniform.  Nine of the 13 patients with squamous cell history enrolled did not bleed, suggesting that it may be possible to identify a subset of patients with squamous cell histology at lower risk for hemorrhage when treated with bevacizumab.  
The squamous cell NSCLC population anticipated to have the lowest risk for severe or 
life-threatening pulmonary bleeding has extra-t horacic disease (i.e., liver, adrenal, bone) 
and/or small volume disease in the peripheral lung parenchyma.  Restriction of treatment to this population may mitigate against severe bleeding and broaden the availability of a potentially effective, well-tolerated therapy, bevacizumab combined with Tarceva, to patients with unmet medical need. 
Of patients with NSCLC, 25%–30% will develop brain metastases during the course of 
their disease (Langer 2005).  Patients with brain metastases will comprise an increasingly large proportion of the NSCLC population as patients live longer as the result of more effective therapies (Gaspar et al. 2005). 
Patients with brain metastases were prev iously excluded from receiving bevacizumab 
because of the potential risk of bleeding. 
In ECOG Study 4599, patients with brain metastases were ineligible for study 
participation; however, 38 of the 878 enrolled patients, 19 in each treatment group, developed brain metastases during the trial.  Two of the 19 patients in the bevacizumab group had non-fatal bleeding events.  No bleeding events were noted in the other treatment group. 
 
Bevacizumab and Erlotinib—Genentech, Inc. 
42/P OSI3364g-A6 The spontaneous bleeding rate of 10% in bevacizumab-treated patients is similar to the 
incidence of spontaneous hemorrhage reported in patients with brain metastases of various tumor types, ranging from 0.8% to 14% (Mandybur 1997; Bitoh et al. 1984).  This rate drops to as low as 0%–1.2% in series of patients treated with whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT), stereotactic radiosurgery, and surgery (Andrews et al. 2004; Noel et al. 2003; Maor et al. 2000).  This suggests a lower spontaneous hemorrhage rate in patients with treated brain metastases. 
The prognosis for patients with advanced or recurrent NSCLC is poor; the treatment 
options and the ability of patients to tolerate second- and third-line therapies are limited.  Study OSI3364g was designed to investigate the role of Tarceva with or without bevacizumab in the setting of second-line treatment of NSCLC in an attempt to develop an effective second-line therapy without significant associated toxicity.  The study has been amended to include the enrollment of patients with squamous cell carcinoma at low risk for pulmonary hemorrhage and patients with treated brain metastases (except those who have an ongoing requirement for treatment with dexamethasone at screening) to address the unmet medical need of a larger population of patients. 
Patient safety continues to be of principal concern in Study OSI3364g given the novelty 
of the combination and the demonstrated risk for hemorrhage with bevacizumab therapy.  
Frequent safety monitoring of the treated population during the treatment period by a DMC is a component of this study.  The DM C reviewed serious adverse events monthly 
and full safety data until the final analysis.  They had the ability to recommend study continuance based upon their findings (see Section 4.8.8).  Special attention was paid to hemorrhage events. 
Genentech  performed safety reviews after the final analysis.  
The final analysis of OSI3364g showed that the addition of bevacizumab to erlotinib 
improved PFS and ORR.  However, this clinical benefit was not associated with an improvement in survival. 
Amendment 5 allowed investigators and patients who had not progressed the option to 
continue active study treatment until disease progression, while continuing to provide 
long-term data on the safety of the bevacizumab and erlotinib combination.  
Forty-eight patients remained on study treatment at the time of the final BETA analysis.  
Some had been on study for more than 1 year.  The continued collection of safety 
information on these long-term non-progressing patients  allowed for a better description 
of the long-term safety profile of the bevacizumab and erlotinib combination. 
All placebo treatment in the BETA trial will be discontinued to remove the risks and 
discomforts associated with infusion therapy.  
 
Bevacizumab and Erlotinib—Genentech, Inc. 
43/P OSI3364g-A6 Investigators and patients are not obligated to remain on study treatment.  They may 
choose to discontinue trial participation given the failure of the study to meet its primary endpoint of improved overall survival. 
Upon enactment of Amendment 6, data collection will be restricted to spontaneous 
reporting of serious adverse events via MedWatch FDA 3500 forms (not in the case report form [CRF]), and handled according to instructions in Section 5.4. SAE data will be collected via the safety database only. 
3.8 ADMINISTRATIVE STRUCTURE 
This study has been sponsored by Genentech and managed with the support of a contract research organization (CRO) that provided clinical data management and monitoring support.  Six hundred thirty-six patients were enrolled at approximately 200 centers in the United States, Europe, and the rest of the world.  Randomization occurred through the IVRS (see Section 4.2). 
3.9 COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS AND REGULATIONS 
This study will be conducted according to the International Conference on Harmonisation E6 Guideline for Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and any national requirements.  
4. MATERIALS AND METHODS  
The materials and methods below were utilized prior to the final analysis of OSI3364g.  These should be continued for all patients who remain on study treatment after the final analysis, unless stated otherwise. 
4.1 PATIENTS 
4.1.1 Patient Selection  
Enrollment in the BETA lung trial has been completed. 
Patients were eligible for this second-line therapy study if they had recurrent or refractory 
(progression through at least two cycles of a given chemotherapeutic regimen) NSCLC 
following standard first-line chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy.  This guideline was based on a number of the life-threatening and fatal hemorrhagic events in NSCLC patients, which were associated with these characteristics.  This was incorporated as a guideline for this study because it is difficult to objectively quantify.  Additional specific inclusion and exclusion criteria are listed below. 
4.1.2 Inclusion Criteria  
Patients had to fulfill all of the following criteria to be eligible for study entry: 
• Signed written informed consent  
 
Bevacizumab and Erlotinib—Genentech, Inc. 
44/P OSI3364g-A6 • Cytologically or histologically confirmed NSCLC 
Patients had to have histologically or cytologically confirmed NSCLC.  Tumors of 
mixed histology were categorized by the predominant cell type unless small cell 
elements were present, in which case the patient was not eligible for study participation.  Cytologic or histologic elements may have been established on metastatic tumor aspirates or biopsy. 
Patients with squamous cell carcinoma were eligible provided that their disease 
was extrathoracic or that their intrathoracic disease consists of peripheral lesions 
only.  A peripheral lesion was defined as a lesion (or lesions) in which the 
epicenter of the tumor was ≤  2 cm from the costal or diaphragmatic pleura in a 
3-dimensional orientation based on each lobe of the lung, and  > 2 cm from the 
trachea, main, and lobar bronchi.  
Squamous cell carcinoma patients were eligible for study participation 
irrespective of the proximity of their adenopathy to the costal or diaphragmatic 
pleura or major airways.  Patients with hilar adenopathy were eligible for study participation. 
Patients with squamous cell carcinoma had to have a copy of the screening 
computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans (either 
as copy films or digital images) reviewed by Genentech or its designee prior to randomization.  Patients were not randomized until Genentech or its de signee 
confirmed eligibility.  
Patients with a history of brain metastases were eligible for study participation, as 
long as their brain metastases had been treated and they did not have an 
ongoing requirement for treatment with dexamethasone at screening.  Treatment 
had to be with WBRT (e.g., 3000 cGy over 2 weeks) and might include neurosurgery, or stereotactic radiosurgery.  Radiotherapy and stereotactic 
radiosurgery had been completed at least 4 weeks prior to Day 0 (see 
Section 4.3.2).  Neurosurgery had be completed at least 24 weeks prior to Day 0, and brain biopsy must be completed at least 12 weeks prior to Day 0.   
• Clinical or radiographic progression during or after first-line chemotherapy or 
chemoradiotherapy for NSCLC 
Patients receiving neo-adjuvant and adjuvant therapy for Stage I–IIIa disease prior to their first-line regimen were eligible for study participation provided they 
had also received first-line therapy (for unresectable, metastatic disease) and 
had demonstrated progression during or after that first-line therapy. 
• Consent to provide archival tissue for analysis was required for participation in this 
study.  Patients who consented to provide tissue but whose archival tissue was found to be inadequate (e.g., stained slides) remained eligible for study 
participation).

potential 
• INR no greater than 1.3 and an aPTT no greater than the upper limits of normal 
within 28 days prior to enrollment for patients not on low-molecular-weight heparin 
or fondaparinux.  Patients on low-molecular-weight heparin or fondaparinux were not required to meet INR or aPTT limits.   
4.1.3 Exclusion Criteria  
Patients meeting any of the following criteria were ineligible for study entry: 
• Squamous cell carcinoma, except for patient s with no intrathoracic disease or small 
peripheral lesions only  
A peripheral lung lesion was defined as any lesion meeting the following criteria:  
A lesion (or lesions) in which the epicenter of the tumor was ≤ 2 cm from the 
costal or diaphragmatic pleura in a 3-dimensional orientation based on each lobe 
of the lung, and >  2 cm from the trachea, main, and lobar bronchi. 
Adenopathy was not considered when assessing the peripheral nature of a patient’s squamous cell carcinoma.  Patients were eligible for study participation 
irrespective of the proximity of their adenopathy to the costal or diaphragmatic 
pleura or major airways.  
• Prior treatment with an investigational or marketed inhibitor of the EGFR pathway or 
anti-angiogenesis agent   
Angiogenesis inhibitors include (but are not limited to) bevacizumab, thalidomide, CP 547632, SU 11248, and PTK 787.

currently breast-feeding may not participate in this study.  All women of 
childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test within 1 week prior to randomization. 
• Presence of another invasive cancer within 5 years prior to randomization, except 
for adequately treated basal or squamous cell skin cancer, or carcinoma in situ of 
the cervix 
• Evidence of confusion or disorientation, or history of major psychiatric illness that

4.2 METHOD OF TREATMENT ASSIGNMENT AND BLINDING 
Note: This study has been fully recruited and all subjects were unblinded to study drug 
following the final analysis. Upon enactment of Amendment 6, the interactive voice 
response system (IVRS) will be cancelled.  Prior to enactment of Amendment 6, treatment assignment and unblinding were managed as below. 
After written informed consent was obtained and eligibility established (with archival 
tissue identified and available for research testing), the study site obtained the patient’s identification number and treatment assignment from the IVRS.  Patients could be randomized up to 5 days prior to receiving their first dose of study treatment.  A hierarchical dynamic randomization schem e was used to ensure an approximately equal 
sample size for the two treatment arms overall, within each of the four categories defined by baseline ECOG performance status (0/1  vs. 2) and smoking history (never vs. 
current/previous), within each sex, and within each study site. 
Genentech, the investigator, and the patient were blinded to treatment assignment.  
Unblinding of treatment assignment prior to final study analysis was permitted only for a serious study drug–related toxicity.  All cases of safety unblinding required the approval 
 
Bevacizumab and Erlotinib—Genentech, Inc. 
48/P OSI3364g-A6 of the Medical Monitor.  After the final analysis, unblinding information was provided to 
all sites with patients receiving study treatment.  Unblinding information for patients who had completed study treatment prior to the final analysis was provided upon request. 
If a patient discontinued Tarceva therapy because of unmanageable toxicity, an 
unblinding request could be made to determine the treatment assignment.  Study bevacizumab/placebo was discontinued and subsequent therapy provided at the discretion of the treating clinician. 
Any toxicities associated or possibly associated with bevacizumab treatment were and 
should be managed according to standard medical practice.  Discontinuation of bevacizumab has no immediate therapeutic effect.  Bevacizumab has a terminal half-life of 2–3 weeks; therefore, its discontinuation results in slow elimination over several 
months.  There is no available antidote for bevacizumab.  Investigators  were allowed to 
hold administration of study drug while waiting for a decision on unblinding to be made. 
Any toxicities associated or possibly associated with Tarceva treatment were and should 
be managed according to standard medical practice.  Erlotinib has a median terminal half-life of 36 hours.  There is no available antidote for Tarceva.

Each glass vial contains sodium phosphate, trehalose, polysorbate 20, and SWFI, USP.  Vials contain no preservatives and were for single use only.   
Placebo treatment was discontinued as of 15 November 2008 on a case-by-case 
scenario.  All placebo treatment will be discontinued as of the enactment of Protocol Amendment 5. 
b. Tarceva 
Tarceva will be supplied by Astellas Pharmaceuticals  US on behalf of OSI 
Pharmaceuticals LLC , Inc. and F. Hoffman n-La Roche, Ltd.  The oral tablets are 
conventional, immediate-release tablets contai ning erlotinib as hydrochloride salt.  In 
 
Bevacizumab and Erlotinib—Genentech, Inc. 
49/P OSI3364g-A6 addition to the active ingredient (erlotinib), tablets contain lactose (hydrous), 
microcrystalline cellulose, sodium starch glycolate, sodium lauryl sulfate, magnesium stearate, and the film coating Opadry
® White, which is composed of hypromellose, 
hydroxypropyl cellulose, and titanium dioxide.  Tablets containing 25 mg, 100 mg, and 
150 mg of Tarceva are available.  Erlotinib will be provided in a bottle.  Each bottle 
will contain 30 tablets, a quantity sufficient for 4 consecutive weeks of dosing, with 
overage.  For further details, see the Tarceva® Investigator Brochure or Package Insert 
(see Appendix B). 
4.3.2 Dosage, Administration, and Storage  
a. Bevacizumab/Placebo 
The dose of bevacizumab in this study continues to be 15 mg/kg administered by IV 
infusion on the first day of each 3-week cycle ( ± 4 days; the interval between infusions 
must not be <  17 days).  The bevacizumab dose should be based on the patient’s weight 
at screening (within 7 days prior to randomization) and should remain the same throughout the study ( ± 5% dosing variation).  If bevacizumab/placebo administration fell 
outside of the 4-day visit window, for reasons other than toxicity management, the site had to obtain a protocol waiver prior to the infusion.  The patient’s schedule was then adjusted so that the subsequent bevacizumab/ placebo infusion was given 3 weeks after 
the re-scheduled infusion. 
Protocol waivers are no longer required for changes in treatment.  Changes in the 
treatment dose or schedule may be made based upon the investigator’s judgment and the institutional guidelines of the site.  Placebo dosing will be discontinued for all patients on the Tarceva and placebo arm of the trial without evidence of progression as of the enactment of BETA lung trial Amendment 5.   
The initial bevacizumab/placebo dose was delivered over 90 (±  10) minutes as a 
continuous IV infusion on Day 0.  If a patient experienced an infusion-associated 
adverse event, he or she could be pre-medi cated for the next study drug infusion; 
however, the infusion time could not be decreased for the subsequent infusion.  If the first infusion was tolerated without infusion-associated adverse events, the second infusion could be delivered over 60 minutes ( ± 10 minutes).  If a patient experienced 
infusion-associated adverse events with the 60-minute infusion, all subsequent dose s 
were to be given over 90 minutes.  If the 60-minute infusion was well tolerated,  all subsequent infusions could be delivered over 30 ± 10 minutes.  If a patient 
experienced infusion-associated adverse events with the 30-minute infusion, all subsequent doses were to be given over 60 minutes.  If the patient continued to experience infusion-associated adverse events with the 90-minute infusion, the patient’s symptoms were managed per institutional standard of care. 
 
Bevacizumab and Erlotinib—Genentech, Inc. 
50/P OSI3364g-A6 At sites where study treatment continues, upon receipt of the study drug, vials are to be 
refrigerated at 2 °C–8 °C (36 °F–46°F) and should remain refrigerated until use.  DO NOT 
FREEZE.  DO NOT SHAKE. 
VIALS ARE FOR SINGLE USE ONLY.  Vials used for one patient may not be used for 
any other patient. 
The final analysis for Study OSI 3364g was completed in October 2008.  The addition of 
bevacizumab to erlotinib in the study was not  associated with an improvement in overall 
survival.  However, bevacizumab when combined with erlotinib doubled PFS and ORR, providing clear evidence of clinical acti vity (see Appendix C).  Patients’ treatment 
assignments have subsequently been unblinded. 
Investigators and their patients have the option to continue active study treatment until 
the time of progression, while continuing to provide long-term data on the safety of the bevacizumab and erlotinib combination.  Investigators and patients may also choose to discontinue active therapy, given the failure of the study to meet the primary endpoint of improved overall survival. 
In cases where the decision is made to continue study treatment, all placebo treatment 
will be discontinued, thus removing the risks and discomforts associated with infusion therapy.  All treatment modifications should be made using the investigator’s judgment and taking into account the guidance provided by the protocol, the Package Insert, and Investigator’s Brochure. 
b. Tarceva 
The dose of Tarceva continues to be 150 mg/day orally.  Tablets should be taken at the 
same time each day with ~200 mL (6− 8 ounces) of water on an empty stomach at least 
1 hour before or 2 hours after a meal.  Toxicity due to Tarceva administration may be managed by symptomatic treatment, dose interruptions, and/or adjustment of the Tarceva dose (see Section 4.3.4 and Table 1). 
Patient compliance in taking the assigned Tar ceva daily dose was assessed by standard 
tablet counts.  Bottles or blister packs containing the daily dose of Tarceva for 30 days 
were given to patients on the first day of each 3-week cycle.  Previously distributed bottles or blister packs were returned to the clinic and counted; discrepancies were resolved with the patient at each clinic visit and documented in the patient’s medical chart.   
These drug accountability measures should be continued at sites where patients 
continue to receive study drug. 
Tarceva tablets will be supplied for patients who have not progressed on study treatment 
in white, high-density polyethylene (HDPE) bottles with child-resistant closures or in PVC 
 
Bevacizumab and Erlotinib—Genentech, Inc. 
51/P OSI3364g-A6 blister packs sealed with aluminum foil.  Bottles and blister packs should be stored at 
temperatures between 15°C and 30°C (59°F and 86°F).   
4.3.3 Dosage Modification  
Upon enactment of Amendment 6, no dose adjustments will be permitted. Any patient requiring a dose modification due to an AE or PD should be terminated from the study and treated following the physician’s usual standard of care.  Prior to Amendment 6, dose modifications were  handled as below. 
a. Bevacizumab/Placebo 
Patients should continue to be assessed clinically for toxicity prior to, during, and after 
each infusion.  If unmanageable toxicity occurs because of bevacizumab/placebo, treatment with bevacizumab/placebo should be discontinued.  All placebo treatment will be discontinued as of the enactment of Amendment 5. 
Patients have the option to continue on single-agent Tarceva until disease progression 
or unmanageable Tarceva toxicity. 
Infusion Reaction.   Infusion of bevacizumab/placebo should be interrupted for patients 
who develop dyspnea or clinically significant  hypotension.  Patients who experience an 
NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE, Version 3.0) Grade 
3 or 4 allergic reaction/hypersensitivity, acute respiratory distress syndrome, or bronchospasm (regardless of grade) will be discontinued from bevacizumab/placebo treatment. 
The infusion should be slowed to 50% or less or interrupted for patients who experience 
any infusion-associated symptoms not specified above.  When the patient’s symptoms have completely resolved, the infusion may be continued at no more than 50% of the rate prior to the reaction and increased in 50% increments every 30 minutes if well tolerated.  Infusions may be restarted at the full rate during the next cycle.  See Section 4.2 for the study drug unblinding procedure. 
b. Tarceva  
Dose reduction or interruption of Tarceva for toxicity may take place at any time during 
the study.  Dose level reductions are presented in Table 1.  If patients do not tolerate the second dose reduction, they should be withdrawn from Tarceva treatment and the treatment phase of the study and should enter survival follow-up.  If a patient was discontinued because of Tarceva toxicity, prior to Amendment 5, an unblinding request could be made by the investigator to determine the treatment assignmen t.  The 
treatment assignments of the patients remaining on trial have been unblinded to their clinical team.  Subsequent therapy will be provided at the discretion of the treating clinician.

4.3.4 Management of Toxiciti es Related to Study Treatment  
Upon enactment of Amendment 6, no dose adjustments will be permitted. Any patient 
requiring a dose modification due to an AE or PD should be terminated from the study and treated following the physician’s usual standard of care.  Prior to Amendment 6, toxicities related to study treatment were managed were handled as below. 
Criteria for dose modification and guidelines for the management of toxicities are 
summarized in Table 2 . 
These criteria should be followed for all patients who remain on study treatment after the 
enactment of Amendment 5.  However, all treatment decisions are to be made by the treating physician based on his or her clinical judgment and in accordance with institutional practice and guidelines.

d Patients on Tarceva who require full-dose ant icoagulation may not be anticoagulated with 
full-dose warfarin; however, patients with indwelling catheters may receive low-dose warfarin 
for prophylaxis against catheter thrombosis.  In this situation, the patient’s INR should be 
closely followed because of a potential drug −drug interaction between Tarceva and warfarin.  
 
 
Bevacizumab and Erlotinib—Genentech, Inc. 
58/P OSI3364g-A6 Other serious adverse events or Grade 3 or 4 adverse events deemed by the 
investigator to be related to bevacizumab/placebo or Tarceva should be managed as follows:    
If bevacizumab/placebo is the causal drug and the event experienced by the patient is a 
Grade 4 adverse event, the patient should be permanently discontinued from bevacizumab/placebo.  For Grade 3 adverse events, the patient may restart bevacizumab/placebo at the same dose level if the event has resolved to Grade ≤ 1.  If, 
following re-initiation of bevacizumab/placebo, the adverse event recurs at Grade ≥ 2, 
bevacizumab/placebo should be permanently di scontinued.  Patients who discontinue 
bevacizumab have the option of continuing on Tarceva until progressive disease or unmanageable toxicity.   
If Tarceva is the causal drug, patients may restart Tarceva at the same dose level or at a 
reduced dose if the event has resolved to Grade ≤  1.  If, following re-initiation of 
Tarceva, the adverse event recurs at Grade ≥ 2, Tarceva should again be held until the 
event has resolved (Grade ≤ 1).  Tarceva may be restarted at a reduced dose if the 
event has resolved to Grade ≤  1 after the second interruption.  If the adverse event 
recurs after the patient has had two dose reductions, the patient should be permanently discontinued from Tarceva and the treatment phase of the study and should enter survival follow-up.   
Dose re-escalation of Tarceva to the next highest level (but never exceeding 
150 mg/day) may be attempted at the discretion of the Principal Investigator if toxicity has resolved to Grade ≤  1 at the reduced dose for ≥  4 weeks.   
If Tarceva is permanently discontinued, the patient must be discontinued from the treatment phase of the study, including permanent discontinuation of bevacizumab/placebo.  If a patient is discontinued because of Tarceva toxicity, an unblinding request may be made by the investigator to determine the treatment assignment.  No unblinding requests will be necessary as of Amendment 5, as all patients receiving study treatment will have been unblinded and all placebo treatment 
discontinued.   
Subsequent therapy will be provided at the discretion of the treatment clinician. 
If either drug is held for ≥ 6 weeks, permanent discontinuation from that drug may be 
considered. 
4.4 CONCOMITANT AND EXCLUDED THERAPIES 
Upon enactment of Amendment 6, no info rmation on concomitant therapies will be 
collected.  Prior to Amendment 6, information on concomitant therapies were collected 
as below.  
 
Bevacizumab and Erlotinib—Genentech, Inc. 
59/P OSI3364g-A6 The following concomitant and excluded therapies are guidelines that should be 
considered and may be followed by all physicians and patients who elect to remain on study treatment after the enactment of Amendment 5.  All treatment decisions are to be made by the treating physician based upon his or her clinical judgment and in accordance with institutional practice and guidelines. 
4.4.1 Concomitant Therapies and Procedures  
All concomitant medications administered within 14 days preceding the initial study treatment administration on this study through the 30-day Post −Study Treatment 
Discontinuation Visit were recorded.  The reason(s) for treatment, dosage, and dates of treatment should have been reported to the investigator and recorded as instructed on the study-specific Case Report Forms (CRFs). 
• Patients should receive full supportive care, including hematopoietic growth factors 
such as Epogen ® (epoetin), transfusions of blood and blood products, antibiotics, 
etc., when appropriate. 
• Use of anti-tumor therapies is permitted after study treatment discontinuation. 
• Use of oral contraceptives or hormone-replacement therapy should be continued. • Patients who experience infusion-associated temperature elevations to ≥ 38.5°C 
(101.3°F) or other infusion-associated symptoms may be treated symptomatically 
with acetaminophen, diphenhydramine, meperidine,  
or other medications as clinically indicated, including ≤ 48 hours of treatment with 
corticosteroids. 
• Patients with indwelling venous catheters may receive prophylaxis against catheter 
thrombosis in accordance with the local standard of care.  Because of a potential 
drug–drug interaction between Tarceva and warfarin, it is suggested that patient 
coagulation parameters be monitored if the patient receives low-dose warfarin. 
• Full-dose anticoagulation using low-molecular-weight heparin or fondaparinux is 
permitted, starting either prior to study enrollment or during study participation. 
• Concurrent use of anticoagulation and non-steroidal agents are not recommended. 
• If patient is undergoing elective surgery, whenever possible at least 56 days should 
elapse after the last bevacizumab/placebo dose before surgery is performed.  Re-
initiation of study drug following surgery requires documented approval from the 
Medical Monitor. 
• Prolonged use of systemic corticosteroids for the treatment of skin toxicities is 
discouraged.  Patients who are taking corticosteroids for reasons other than skin toxicity at study entry may continue their use.   
• Patients receiving prophylactic or low-dose warfarin or its equivalent require close 
INR monitoring due to a potential drug −drug interaction with Tarceva  
• Other medication considered necessary for the patient’s safety and well being may 
be given at the discretion of the investigator(s). 
 
 
Bevacizumab and Erlotinib—Genentech, Inc. 
60/P OSI3364g-A6 Because Tarceva is metabolized via the CYP3A4 pathway, agents known to inhibit or 
induce CYP3A4 function may alter the pharmacokinetics of Tarceva.  Although caution and careful monitoring are recommended when use of these compounds is necessary; usage does not exclude patient participation in this study. 
4.4.2 Excluded Therapies  
The following therapies were excluded during the treatment phase of the study:  
• Investigational agents  
• Anti-neoplastic or anti-tumor agents, including chemotherapy, radiation therapy, 
immunotherapy, and hormonal anti-cancer therapy  
• Full-dose anticoagulation with warfarin • Chronic daily use of aspirin (>
 325 mg/day) or other full-dose NSAIDs with 
anti-platelet activity 
• Dexamethasone for treatment associated with brain metastases 
 
4.5 STUDY ASSESSMENTS 
Upon enactment of Amendment 6, data collection will be restricted to spontaneous 
reporting of serious adverse events via MedWatch FDA 3500 forms, not in the CRF, and handled according to instructions in Section 5.4.  Prior to Amendment 6, assessments were conducted as below.  
4.5.1 Screening and Pr etreatment Assessments

The rules below, with the exception of placebo treatment, should be followed until 
Amendment 5 is approved at your site. 
• Administer bevacizumab by infusion  
If the bevacizumab infusion falls outside of the 4-day window, the patient’s 
schedule should be adjusted so that the subsequent bevacizumab/placebo infusion is given 3 weeks after the re-scheduled infusion. 
• Collect previously dispensed Tarceva bottle(s)/blister pack(s) and verify patient 
compliance using a standard tablet count (number of tablets taken divided by the 
number of days since the last visit)

administration of Tarceva ora lly daily for 21 days each cycle 
• Record adverse events 
 
4.5.3 Study Treatment Discontinuation Visit  
Following termination of the study no further information will be collected upon 
enactment of Amendment 6.  Patients will be followed according to the physician’s 
usual standard of care.  Prior to Amendment 6, the study termination visit and follow-up assessments were conducted as below. 
Patients may remain in the treatment phase of the study until disease progression or 
until unmanageable toxicity.  The treatment phase is completed when both drugs are discontinued.  Patients who discontinue bevac izumab have the option of continuing on 
 
Bevacizumab and Erlotinib—Genentech, Inc. 
65/P OSI3364g-A6 Tarceva until progressive disease or unmanageable toxicity.  Patients who discontinue 
Tarceva will be discontinued from the treatment phase of the study, including discontinuation from bevacizumab.  
A Study Treatment Discontinuation Visit should be scheduled at the completion of the 
treatment phase or at the time of the decision to discontinue treatment.  The following evaluations and procedures will be performed at the Study Treatment Discontinuation Visit: 
• Perform laboratory assessments in keeping with the institutional standard according 
to the investigator’s judgment. 
• Collect previously dispensed Tarceva bottle(s)/blister pack(s) and verify patient 
compliance using a standard tablet count (number of tablets taken divided by the 
number of days since the last visit) 
• Perform radiologic evaluations if warranted by the clinical situation or in accordance 
with institutional guidelines.  Patients with a history of brain metastases must have a 
CT or MRI of the brain 
 ± 7 days of the treatment discontinuation visit. 
• Perform targeted physical examination as per institutional guidelines 
• Record adverse events  
Patients who experience an adverse event at treatment completion or at study 
treatment discontinuation should be followed by the investigator or his or her 
designee to determine the status of the event until the event is resolved, 
determined to be irreversible by the investigator, or until the patient begins an alternate form of treatment for their disease (excluding localized radiotherapy). 
• Reconcile discrepancies in drug accountability 
• Record reason for study treatment discontinuation  
 
4.5.4 30-Day Post −Study Treatment Di scontinuation Visit  
Patients who are discontinued from the treatment phase should return for a visit 
~30 days (28 to 42 days) after the last dose of study treatment for a study assessment.  Record adverse events for 30 days following the last dose of either drug. 
4.5.5 Follow-Up Assessments  
Prior to the final analysis, survival follow-up information was collected via telephone calls and/or clinic visits every 6 weeks ( ± 2 weeks) until death, loss to follow-up, or study termination by Genentech.  Survival follow- up after 30 days after the last dose of study 
treatment is not required for patients as of Amendment 5, as subsequent information will not alter the primary results of the trial. 
 
Bevacizumab and Erlotinib—Genentech, Inc. 
66/P OSI3364g-A6 4.6 STUDY DRUG DISCONTINUATION 
Reasons for study drug (or treatment phase) discontinuation may include, but are not 
limited to, the following: 
• Patient’s request to withdraw from study treatment  
• Unwillingness or inability to comply with study requirements • Clinical need for concomitant or ancillary therapy that is not permitted in the study 
• Unrelated intercurrent illness that, in the judgment of the Principal Investigator, will 
affect assessments of clinical status to a significant degree 
• Progression of disease 
• Unacceptable toxicity • Completion of the final analysis for the primary endpoint of the trial 
It is the right and duty of the investigator to interrupt the treatment of any patient whose 
health or well-being may be threatened by continuation in this study.  Such patients should be withdrawn from the treatment phase of the study, not continued under a modified regimen. 
4.7 STUDY TERMINATION 
Genentech has the right to terminate this study at any time.  Reasons for terminating the study may include, but are not limited to, the following: 
• The incidence or severity of adverse events in this or other studies indicates a 
potential health hazard to patients 
• Data recording is inaccurate or incomplete 
 
4.8 STATISTICAL METHODS 
The statistical methods noted below were utilized during the interim and final 
analyses for OSI3364g when appropriate.   Upon enactment of Amendment 6, no 
further analysis will be done. Data collecti on will be restricted to the spontaneous 
reporting of serious adverse events via MedWatch FDA 3500 forms and will not be captured in the CRF.  
OSI3364g was a randomized, placebo-controlled trial designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of bevacizumab in combination with Tarceva relative to Tarceva monotherapy in second-line patients with advanced NSCLC. Two interim analyses were conducted during the study.  The first was for safety and the second for safety and efficacy.  
Descriptive summaries of continuous data were used to present the group mean, 
standard deviation, median, minimum, maximum, and sample size.  Descriptive summaries of discrete data were used to present the number of patients and incidence as a frequency and as a percentage. 
 
Bevacizumab and Erlotinib—Genentech, Inc. 
67/P OSI3364g-A6 4.8.1 Analysis of th e Conduct of the Study  
The number of patients randomized were tabulated by center and by treatment arm.  
Eligibility exceptions and protocol deviations were summarized by treatment arm.  Patient disposition was tabulated by treatment arm, and reasons for premature discontinuation were summarized.  Tarceva and bevacizumab exposure was also summarized. 
4.8.2 Analysis of Treatment Arm Comparability  
Treatment arms were assessed for comparability with respect to demographic and baseline characteristics, including age; sex; race; weight; smoking status; histology; disease stage; disease measurability; bas eline ECOG performance status; number of 
metastatic disease sites; history of treated brain metastases; EGFR expression status by IHC; EGFR gene copy number by FISH; and EGFR and Kras mutation status.  The baseline value of any variable was defined as the last available value prior to the first administration of study treatment. 
4.8.3 Efficacy Analyses  
To control the overall Type I error rate at the 5% level, the fixed sequence testing procedure (Westfall and Krishen 2001) was used to adjust for multiple statistical testing of the primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints.  These endpoints were tested in the following order: 
• Overall survival 
• PFS 
• Objective response 
• Duration of objective response 
 
No adjustment to the α level will be made for the other analyses. 
a. Efficacy Analysis Population 
Analyses of overall survival and PFS included all patients who were randomized.  
For objective response and clinical benefit, only patients with measurable disease at 
baseline were included in the analysis.  For duration of response, only responders were included in the analysis.  All analyses were based on the treatment arm to which patients were randomized. 
b. Primary Endpoint 
The primary efficacy endpoint was overall surv ival, defined as the period from the date of 
randomization (as entered in the IVRS) until the date of patient death from any cause.  
All deaths were included, regardless of whether they occur during treatment or following treatment discontinuation.  For patients who have not died, survival data were censored at the date of last contact.   
 
Bevacizumab and Erlotinib—Genentech, Inc. 
68/P OSI3364g-A6 The two-sided log-rank test, stratified by the randomization stratification factors, was 
used to perform hypothesis testing for assessing the primary study objective.  The randomization stratification factors were ECOG performance status (0/1 vs. 2), smoking history (never vs. current/previous), sex (male vs. female), and study site; however, because of the large number of study sites in this trial, study sites will not be included in any efficacy analyses adjusted for randomization stratification factors.  Levels of the stratification factors reported on the CRF were used in the analysis.  A sensitivity analysis stratified using levels reported on the IVRS was performed.  Both analyses were based on the treatment arm to which the patients have been randomized.   
An interim efficacy analysis was conducted when approximately 67% of the required 
deaths (280 deaths) occurred.  Overall survival was tested at the significance level determined using the Lan-DeMets alpha spending function with an O’Brien-Fleming boundary so that the overall type I error rate will be maintained at the 0.05 level. The DMC recommended that the study continue as planned.  The final efficacy analysis was conducted when 418 deaths occurred. 
The unstratified log-rank test was performed as a sensitivity analysis.  The Kaplan-Meier 
methods were used to estimate median overall survival for each treatment arm.  Cox proportional hazard models, using two models (with and without stratification by the 
randomization stratification factors), were employed to estimate the hazard ratio (i.e., the magnitude of treatment effect and 95% CI).   
c. Secondary Endpoints 
Progression-Free Survival.  PFS was defined as the time from randomization to 
documented disease progression or death from any cause on study treatment, 
whichever occurred earlier.  Disease progre ssion was assessed by the investigator 
according to RECIST.  Death on study treatment was defined as death from any cause within 30 days of the last dose of study treatment. 
Data for patients without disease progression or patients who had not died on study 
treatment was censored at the time of the last tumor assessment (or, if no tumor assessments were performed after the baseline visit, at the time of randomization plus 1 day).  Analysis methods were the same as those described for overall survival. 
Objective Response.  Objective response was defined as a complete or partial 
response determined on two consecutive occasions ≥  4 weeks apart.  Only patients with 
measurable disease at baseline were included in the analysis of the objective response.  Patients without a post-baseline tumor assessment were considered non-responders. 
An estimate of the ORR and its 95% CI were calculated for each treatment arm.  
The 95% CI for the treatment difference was also calculated.  The Mantel-Haenszel χ2 
test stratified by randomization stratification factors (ECOG performance status  
 
Bevacizumab and Erlotinib—Genentech, Inc. 
69/P OSI3364g-A6 [0/1 vs. 2], smoking history [never vs. current/previous], and sex) was used to compare 
the treatment groups.  An unadjusted Fisher’s exact test result was also provided. 
Duration of Objective Response.   Among patients with an objective response, duration 
of objective response was defined as the period from the date of initial partial or 
complete response until the date of disease progression or death from any cause on study treatment.  Methods for handling censoring and analysis were the same as those described for PFS.  Only patients with an objective response were included in the analysis of duration of objective response. 
Evaluation of Relationship between Exploratory Markers and Efficacy Outcomes.   
To evaluate the effect of exploratory markers on efficacy outcome, efficacy outcomes 
were summarized for all patients and by treatment arm within each subgroup determined by exploratory markers.  Markers cons idered include the presence or absence of 
somatic gene mutations of the EGFR pathway , EGFR protein expression by IHC, EGFR 
gene copy number by FISH, and other markers relevant for the EGFR pathway.  The 
exploration of markers relevant for the VEGF pathway was considered.  Efficacy outcomes considered for this analysis included overall survival, PFS, and ORR.  Exploratory marker analyses were performed on batched sample sets; results of these analyses were not made available to patients or investigators. 
d. Additional Efficacy Analyses 
Effect of Risk Factors.   The Cox proportional hazards model (when appropriate) was 
be used to estimate the effect of risk factors on PFS and duration of survival and to 
evaluate any modifications of treatment effec t.  To evaluate the effects of risk factors on 
objective response and to assess modifications of treatment effect, a logistic regression model (if appropriate) were applied. 
Clinical Benefit.  Clinical benefit was defined as objective response or stable disease 
maintained for at least 6 weeks.  Only patients with measurable disease at baseline were included in the analysis of clinical benefit.  The clinical benefit rate was analyzed as described for the ORR. 
4.8.4 Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic Analyses  
a. Assessment of the Effect of Bevacizumab on Erlotinib Disposition 
Intensive pharmacokinetic sampling was conducted at selected medical centers to 
evaluate the pharmacokinetic behavior of Tarceva when administered as a single agent or when administered in combination wi th bevacizumab, and to evaluate the 
pharmacokinetic behavior of bevacizumab when administered with Tarceva.  A subset of at least 17 patients from each treatment arm were scheduled to undergo intensive pharmacokinetic analysis. 
 
Bevacizumab and Erlotinib—Genentech, Inc. 
70/P OSI3364g-A6 Plasma sampling for erlotinib in both arms was performed at Week 3 (Day 21), when 
erlotinib was at steady state and following the second dose of bevacizumab/placebo .  Actual doses and sample collection times were used for pharmacokinetic analysis.  The disposition of erlotinib in the presence of bevacizumab was compared with the pharmacokinetic profile of the erlotinib in the monotherapy arm. 
Erlotinib and OSI-420 C
max, Tmax, Cmin,ss, AUC 0–tau, Cmax,ss, and CL/F ss (erlotinib only) was 
estimated by the non-compartmental approach using a validated software program 
(WinNonlin, version 3.1; Pharsight Corp., Mountain View, CA).  OSI-420 is a primary and active metabolite of erlotinib produced by me tabolism by the cytochrome P-450 system.  
Drug interactions could result in alterations in either or both erlotinib and OSI-420 plasma concentrations. 
AUC during the dosing interval for both erlotinib and OSI-420 was calculated using 
standard non-compartmental methods.  A 90% CI for the geometric mean ratio (GMR) of the AUC for the Tarceva + bevacizumab and Tarceva +  placebo treatment arms was 
calculated for both erlotinib and OSI-420.  Each 90% CI was calculated for the difference of the log-transformed AUCs using the t-distribution and then back-transformed to the ratio scale. 
In addition, because AAG is a significant covariate in erlotinib clearance, AAG levels 
were drawn on Day 21. 
b. Assessment of the Effect of Erlotinib on Bevacizumab Disposition 
Because there is no arm in which bevacizumab was administered alone (in the absence of 
erlotinib), the assessment of drug interaction on bevacizumab pharmacokinetics was different than from above.  Bevacizumab concentrations in the bevacizumab +  erlotinib 
arm were compared with historical concentration data used in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in cancer patients receiving bevacizumab in Phase I–III studies (Report 03-0324-1751 [Population Pharmacokinetics of Bevacizumab:  Structural Model Identification, Mean Population Pharmacokinetic Parameter Estimation, and Covariate Analysis], submitted as part of the Biologics License Application on 25 September 2003).  In the population pharmacokinetic analysis, data from eight clinical trials with bevacizumab administered by intravenous infusion were included.  A total of 4629 bevacizumab concentrations from 491 patients who rece ived bevacizumab doses ranging from 1 to 
20 mg/kg at a dosing frequency ranging from weekly to every 3 weeks were analyzed using a nonlinear mixed-effects modeling approa ch (NONMEM).  This rich dataset from 
the population pharmacokinetic analysis served as a reference for the comparison with the new bevacizumab concentration data from this trial.  Specifically, the effect of Tarceva on bevacizumab pharmacokinetic disposition was evaluated as follows:  
• Compare C
max and C min at Days 21, 42, 63, and 84 in patients from this study with 
historically observed values in patients from the population pharmacokinetic 
database on the same dose schedule of bevacizumab. 
 
Bevacizumab and Erlotinib—Genentech, Inc. 
71/P OSI3364g-A6 • Compare C max and C min at Days 21, 42, 63, and 84 with the simulated 
concentrations at those times based on the population pharmacokinetic model. 
 
4.8.5 Safety Analyses  
Upon enactment of Amendment 6, data collection will be restricted to the spontaneous 
reporting of serious adverse events via MedWatch FDA 3500 forms (not in the CRF), and handled according to instructions in Section 5.4.  Prior to Amendment 5 safety assessments were conducted as below. 
Safety was assessed through summaries of adverse events and laboratory test results.  
Patients who receive any amount of study treatment will be included in the safety 
assessment.  Safety results were summarized by the treatment patients actually received for all patients, for patients with squamous cell carcinoma, for patients with brain metastases treated prior to enrollment, and for patients receiving full-dose anticoagulation with low-molecular-weight heparin or fondaparinux. 
Safety data collected after the final analysis was reviewed and summarized for inclusion 
in the Investigator’s Brochure by Genentech or Genentech’s agent. 
a. Adverse Events  
As clinical data and AEs will no longer be collected in the clinical database, no AEs 
will be recorded on the CRF.  
Verbatim descriptions of treatment-emergent adverse events were mapped to MedDRA thesaurus terms and graded according to the NCI CTCAE, Version 3.0.  All adverse events, including Grade 3, 4, and 5 events and serious adverse events, were summarized by treatment arm and NCI CTCAE grade.  For each patient’s adverse events, the maximum severity recorded were used in the summaries. 
b. Laboratory Data  
Clinical laboratory tests will be performed at local laboratories.  Laboratory toxicities 
were defined based on local laboratory normal ranges and NCI CTCAE, Version 3.0.  Laboratory abnormalities, such as worst toxicity grade and toxicity grade shift from baseline, were summarized by treatment arm. 
c. Vital Signs  
Changes in blood pressure over time were summarized by treatment arm. 
4.8.6 Missing Data  
For overall survival, patients who were lost to follow-up were analyzed as censored 
observations on the date of last contact. 
Details of the analyses of missing data were provided in the Statistical Analysis Plan.  
 
Bevacizumab and Erlotinib—Genentech, Inc. 
72/P OSI3364g-A6 4.8.7 Determination of Sample Size  
This was a Phase III study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of bevacizumab in 
combination with Tarceva relative to Tarceva alone in advanced NSCLC. A 33% improvement in survival was considered a clinically significant outcome. To calculate the number of deaths required in this study, the following assumptions were made: 
• Two-sided log-rank test 
• 83% power at the 5% significance level 
• Hazard ratio of bevacizumab
 + Tarceva versus control (Tarceva alone) of 0.75 
corresponding to a 33% improvement in median overall survival from 8 to 
10.67 months 
• Median overall survival for the control arm is hypothesized based on data from 
Study BR.21, taking into account the difference in patient population. 
• An interim efficacy analysis will be performed when 67% of the required deaths 
have occurred.  The significance level will be determined using the Lan-DeMets 
alpha spending function with an O’Brien-Fleming boundary. 
• Five percent of patients will withdraw consent for survival follow-up or will be lost to 
follow-up. 
With these assumptions, 417 deaths were required for the final analysis.   
4.8.8 Interim Analyses  
The eligible patient population was expanded to include selected patients with 
squamous cell carcinoma, patients with brain metastases treated prior to enrollment, and patients receiving full-dose anticoagulation with low-molecular-weight heparin or fondaparinux.  A DMC monitored the safety of these and all other patients on this trial.  The DMC reviewed safety summaries prepar ed by an external statistical data 
coordinating center, including monthly serious adverse event reports and thorough interim safety reports.  Members of the DMC were external to Genentech and followed a charter that outlined their role and responsibilities.  Study personnel remain blinded to study results until the formal unblinding took place in October 2008. 
All patients were monitored clinically at 3-week intervals and radiographically at 6-week 
intervals through Week 24, at which point scans were followed at 12-week intervals.  Patients with a history of brain metastases also underwent head CT scans or MRI scans every 6 weeks after Day 0 (beginning at Week 6) through Week 24 and then every 12 weeks thereafter.  Summaries of collected serious adverse events were reviewed by the DMC monthly for all patients, for patients with squamous cell carcinoma, and for patients with brain metastases treated prior to enrollment.  
All NCI CTCAE Grade ≥ 3 hemoptysis and symptomatic Grade ≥ 2 CNS hemorrhage 
events were to be reported as serious adverse events.  Grade ≥ 3 hemoptysis events 
were closely monitored for patients with squamous cell carcinoma; enrollment for this 
subpopulation was to be discontinued if the incidence was unacceptable (for the 
 
Bevacizumab and Erlotinib—Genentech, Inc. 
73/P OSI3364g-A6 stopping guidance, see the DMC charter).  Symptomatic Grade ≥ 2 CNS hemorrhage 
events was closely monitored for patients with brain metastases treated prior to 
enrollment; accrual for this subpopulation was to be stopped if the incidence was unacceptable (for the stopping guidance, see the DMC charter).  Symptomatic Grade ≥ 3 
hemorrhage events was closely monitored for patients fully anticoagulated with low-molecular-weight heparin or fondaparinux; accrual for this subpopulation was to be stopped if the incidence of such events was unacceptable.   
Two interim analyses were conducted.  The first interim analysis was conducted after 
123 patients had been enrolled and followed for at least 2 months.  Only safety data were assessed in this analysis.  The DMC reviewed the interim safety report on 10 July 2006 and recommended that the study continue as planned.  
The second interim analysis was conducted when approximately 67% of the required 
deaths (280 deaths) occurred.  Both safety and overall survival were assessed in this analysis.  Formal comparisons between the two treatment arms of the incidence of Grade 3 −5 and Grade 5 hemoptysis were made.  If the incidence in the Tarceva + 
bevacizumab arm was unacceptable, the study would have been stopped (for the stopping guidance, see the DMC charter).  The si gnificance level for the overall survival 
comparison was determined using the Lan-DeMets alpha spending function with an O’Brien-Fleming boundary of 0.0124 at 67% event time and 0.0462 at th e final analysis.  
The overall survival result was not positive,  so the study was continued until 417 deaths 
occurred. 
All summaries/analyses by treatment arm for the DMC review were performed by an 
independent Data Coordinating Center (DCC).  The study team remained blinded to the treatment assignment until study unblinding. 
Upon enactment of Amendment 6, data collection will be restricted to the spontaneous 
reporting of serious adverse events via MedWatch FDA 3500 forms and will not be captured in the CRF. 
4.9 DATA QUALITY ASSURANCE 
Genentech supplied CRFs for this study.  The CRO entered data directly into the Genentech database via secured access and was responsible for the data management of this study, including double data entry and quality checking of the data.  When discrepancies were encountered, the CRO sent requests for data clarification to the sites. 
Genentech performed oversight of the data management of this study.  Genentech 
produced a Data Quality Plan that describes the quality checking to be performed on the data.  Central laboratory data were sent directly to Genentech, using Genentech’s standard procedures to handle and process the electronic transfer of the data. 
 
Bevacizumab and Erlotinib—Genentech, Inc. 
74/P OSI3364g-A6 CRFs and correction documentation were indexed and imaged.  System backups for 
data stored at Genentech and records retention for the study data were consistent with Genentech’s standard procedures. 
5. ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY  
Upon enactment of Amendment 6, safety data collection will be restricted to the spontaneous reporting of serious adverse events via MedWatch FDA 3500 forms and will not be captured in the CRF. The plan below was utilized prior to the final analysis of OSI3364g. 
5.1 SPECIFICATION OF SAFETY VARIABLES  
Safety assessments consisted of monitori ng and recording protocol-defined adverse 
events (AEs) and serious adverse events; measurement of protocol-specified hematology, clinical chemistry, and urinalysis variables; measurement of protocol-specified vital signs; and other protocol-specified tests that are deemed critical to the safety evaluation of the study drug(s). 
Death as a result of disease progression wa s assessed as an efficacy measure and not 
an AE or SAE. 
5.1.1 Adverse Events  
An AE is any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally 
associated with the use of an investigational (medicinal) product or other protocol-imposed intervention, regardless of attribution. 
This includes the following: 
• AEs not previously observed in the patient that emerge during the protocol-specified 
AE reporting period, including signs or symptoms associated with NSCLC that were 
not present prior to the AE reporting period (see Section 5.2.1) 
• Complications that occur as a result of protocol-mandated interventions 
(e.g., invasive procedures such as biopsies) 
• If applicable
, AEs that occur prior to assignment of study treatment associated with 
medication washout, no treatment run-in, or other protocol-mandated intervention 
• Preexisting medical conditions (other than the condition being studied) judged by 
the investigator to have worsened in severity or frequency or changed in character 
during the protocol-specified AE reporting period 
• Diagnoses and/or symptoms associated with NSCLC should be reported as AEs if 
they worsen or change in character.  Clinical progression of NSCLC should not be reported as an AE. 
 
 
Bevacizumab and Erlotinib—Genentech, Inc. 
75/P OSI3364g-A6 5.1.2 Serious Adverse Events  
An AE should be classified as an SAE if: 
• It results in death (i.e., the AE actually causes or leads to death).  
• It is life threatening (i.e., the AE, in the view of the investigator, places the patient at 
immediate risk of death.  It does not include an AE that, had it occurred in a more 
severe form, might have caused death.). 
• It requires or prolongs inpatient hospitalization. 
• It results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (i.e., the AE results in 
substantial disruption of the patient’s ability to conduct normal life functions). 
• It results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect in a neonate/infant born to a mother 
exposed to the investigational product. 
• It is considered a significant medical event by the investigator based on medical 
judgment (e.g., may jeopardize the patient or may require medical/surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above). 
 
All AEs that do not meet any of the criteria for serious should be regarded as 
nonserious AEs. 
The terms “severe” and “serious” are not synonymous.  Severity (or intensity) refers to 
the grade of a specific AE, e.g., mild (Grade 1), moderate (Grade 2), or severe (Grade 3) myocardial infarction (see Section 5.2.2).  “Serious” is a regulatory definition (see previous definition) and is based on patient or event outcome or action criteria usually associated with events that pose a threat to a patient’s life or functioning.  Seriousness (not severity) serves as the guide for defining regulatory reporting obligations from the Sponsor to applicable regulatory authorities.  
Severity and seriousness should be independently assessed when recording AEs and 
SAEs on the CRF. 
Only serious AEs will be collected after the enactment of Amendment 5.  The period of 
collection will extend to 30 days a fter treatment discontinuation. 
Upon enactment of Amendment 6, safety data collection will be restricted to the spontaneous reporting of serious adverse events via MedWatch FDA 3500 forms and will not be captured in the CRF.

Upon enactment of Amendment 6, safety data collection will be restricted to the spontaneous reporting of serious adverse events via MedWatch FDA 3500 forms and will not be captured in the CRF. The plan below was utilized prior to the final analysis of OSI3364g. 
 
Bevacizumab and Erlotinib—Genentech, Inc. 
76/P OSI3364g-A6 The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all AEs and SAEs that are observed or 
reported during the study, as outlined in Section 5.1.1, are recorded on the CRF and 
reported to the Sponsor in accordance with protocol instructions.  
Death as a result of disease progression endpoints are only to be assessed as efficacy 
measures and not as AEs or SAEs. 
5.2.1 Adverse Event Reporting Period  
The study period during which all AEs and SAEs must be reported began after informed 
consent was obtained and study treatment was initiated.  It ends 30 days following the last administration of study treatment or study discontinuation/termination, whichever is earlier.  After this period, investigators should only report SAEs that are attributed to prior study treatment. 
SAEs that were observed or reported prior to initiation of study treatment should be 
recorded as SAEs on the CRF if they were associated with protocol-mandated interventions (e.g., invasive procedures such as biopsies, medication washout, or no treatment run-in). 
5.2.2 Assessment of Adverse Events  
Investigators will assess the occurrence of AEs and SAEs at all patient evaluation timepoints during the study.  All AEs and SAEs whether volunteered by the patient, discovered by study personnel during questioning, or detected through physical examination, laboratory test, or other means should be recorded in the patient’s medical record and on the appropriate AE or SAE CRF page. 
Each recorded AE or SAE should be described by its duration (i.e., start and end dates), 
severity (see Table 3), regulatory seriousness criteria if applicable, suspected relationship to the investigational product (see following guidance), and actions taken. 
The AE grading (severity) scale found in the NCI CTCAE, Version 3.0, should be used 
for AE reporting. 
 
Bevacizumab and Erlotinib—Genentech, Inc. 
77/P OSI3364g-A6 Table 3 Adverse Event Grading (Severity) Scale 
Grade Severity Alternate Description a 
1 Mild (apply event-specific 
NCI CTCAE grading criteria) Transient or mild discomfort 
(< 48 hours); no interference with 
the patient’s daily activities; no medical intervention/therapy required 
2 Moderate (apply event-specific  
NCI CTCAE grading criteria) Mild to moderate interference with the patient’s daily activities; no or minimal medical intervention/therapy required 
3 Severe (apply event-specific  
NCI CTCAE grading criteria) Considerable interference with the patient’s daily activities; medical intervention/therapy required; hospitalization possible 
4 Very severe, life threatening,  
or disabling (apply event-specific NCI CTCAE grading criteria) Extreme limitation in activity; significant medical intervention/therapy required, hospitalization probable 
5 Death related to AE  
Note:  Regardless of severity, some events ma y also meet regulatory serious criteria.  
Refer to definitions of an SAE (s ee Section 5.1.2) and Table 2. 
a Use these alternative definitions for Grade 1, 2, 3, and 4 events when the observed or 
reported AE is not in the NCI CTCAE listing. 
 
To ensure consistency of AE and SAE causality assessments, investigators should 
apply the following general guideline: 
• Yes 
There is a plausible temporal relationship between the onset of the AE and 
administration of the investigational product, and the AE cannot be readily 
explained by the patient’s clinical state, intercurrent illness, or concomitant 
therapies; and/or the AE follows a known pattern of response to the investigational product; and/or the AE abates or resolves upon discontinuation of 
the investigational product or dose reduction and, if applicable, reappears upon 
re-challenge. 
• No 
Evidence exists that the AE has an etiology other than the investigational product 
(e.g., preexisting medical condition, underlying disease, intercurrent illness, or 
concomitant medication); and/or the AE has no plausible temporal relationship to administration of the investigational product (e.g., cancer diagnosed 2 days after 
first dose of study drug). 
Note:  The investigator’s assessment of caus ality for individual AE reports is part of the 
study documentation process.  Regardless of the “Yes” or “No” causality assessment for 
individual AE reports, the Sponsor will promptly evaluate all reported SAEs against 
 
Bevacizumab and Erlotinib—Genentech, Inc. 
78/P OSI3364g-A6 cumulative product experience to identify and expeditiously communicate possible new 
safety findings to investigators and applicable regulatory authorities. 
5.3 PROCEDURES FOR ELICITING, RECORDING, AND 
REPORTING ADVERSE EVENTS 
5.3.1 Eliciting Adverse Events  
A consistent methodology of non-directive questioning for eliciting AEs at all patient evaluation timepoints should be adopted.  Examples of non-directive questions include:  
“How have you felt since your last clinical visit?” 
“Have you had any new or changed health problems since you were last here?” 
 
5.3.2 Specific Instructions for Recording Adverse Events on the 
Case Report Form  
Investigators should use correct medical terminology/concepts when recording AEs or 
SAEs on the CRF.  Avoid colloquialisms and abbreviations. 
AEs should be recorded either on an AE CRF page (if no serious criteria are met) or 
SAE CRF page, but not both. 
Only one medical concept should be recorded in the event field on the AE or SAE CRF 
page. 
a. Diagnosis vs. Signs and Symptoms 
If known at the time of reporting, a diagnosis should be recorded on the CRF rather than 
individual signs and symptoms (e.g., record only liver failure or hepatitis rather than jaundice, asterixis, and elevated transaminases).  However, if a constellation of signs and/or symptoms cannot be medically characte rized as a single diagnosis or syndrome 
at the time of reporting, each individual event should be recorded as an AE or SAE on the CRF.  If a diagnosis is subsequently established, it should be reported as follow-up information. 
b. Adverse Events Occurring Secondary to Other Events 
In general, AEs occurring secondary to other events (e.g., cascade events or clinical 
sequelae) should be identified by their primary cause.  For example, if severe diarrhea is known to have resulted in dehydration, it is sufficient to record only diarrhea as an AE or SAE on the CRF.  
However, medically significant AEs occurring secondary to an initiating event that are 
separated in time should be recorded as independent events on the CRF.  For example, if a severe gastrointestinal hemorrhage leads to renal failure, both events should be recorded separately on the CRF. 
 
Bevacizumab and Erlotinib—Genentech, Inc. 
79/P OSI3364g-A6 c. Persistent or Recurrent Adverse Events 
A persistent AE is one that extends continuously, without resolution between patient 
evaluation timepoints.  Such events should only be recorded once on the CRF unless their severity increases.  If a persistent AE becomes more severe, it should be recorded again on an AE or SAE CRF page.   
A recurrent AE is one that occurs and resolves between patient evaluation timepoints 
and subsequently recurs.  All recurrent AEs should be recorded on an AE or SAE CRF page. 
d. Clinical Laboratory Abnormalities 
Individual laboratory abnormalities will generally not be recorded as AEs on the CRF.  
Only clinically significant laboratory abnormalities that result in study withdrawal, meet serious criteria, are themselves associated with clinical signs or symptoms, or require medical intervention (e.g., low hemoglobin requiring transfusion) will be recorded as AEs or SAEs on the CRF. 
If the clinically significant laboratory abnormality is a sign of a disease or syndrome (e.g., 
alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin 5
 × the upper limit of normal associated with 
cholecystitis), only the diagnosis (e.g., cholec ystitis) needs to be recorded on the AE or 
SAE CRF page. 
If the clinically significant laboratory abnormality is not a sign of a disease or syndrome, 
the abnormality itself should be recorded as an AE or SAE on the CRF.  If the laboratory abnormality can be conveyed as a clinical diagnosis, the diagnosis should be recorded as the AE or SAE.  For example, an elevated serum potassium level of 7.0 mEq/L should be recorded as “hyperkalemia.” 
Observations of the same clinically signific ant laboratory abnormality from visit to visit 
should not be repeatedly recorded as AEs or SAEs on the CRF, unless their severity, 
seriousness, or etiology changes.  
Only serious AEs will be collected after the initiation of Amendment 5.  The period of 
collection will extend to 30 days after treatm ent discontinuation.  This will focus the 
safety evaluation of the bevacizumab and Tar ceva combination on events of greatest 
clinical significance.  
Upon enactment of Amendment 6, safety data collection will be restricted to the spontaneous reporting of serious adverse events via MedWatch FDA 3500 forms and will not be captured in the CRF.   
 
Bevacizumab and Erlotinib—Genentech, Inc. 
80/P OSI3364g-A6 e. Deaths 
For this protocol, mortality was the primary efficacy endpoint.  Deaths that 
occur/occurred during the protocol-specified AE reporting period (see Section 5.2) that are/were attributed by the investigator solely to progression of NSCLC should be recorded only on the Study Discontinuation CRF page.  All other on-study deaths, regardless of attribution, should be recorded on an SAE CRF page and expeditiously reported to the Sponsor.  An independent monitoring committee will monitor the frequency of death from all causes.  After Amendment 5, this will be performed by 
Genentech or its agent. 
When recording a death on an SAE CRF page, the event or condition that caused or 
contributed to the fatal outcome should be recorded as the single medical concept on the SAE CRF page.  If the cause of death is unknown and cannot be ascertained at the time of reporting, record “Unexplained Death” on the SAE CRF page. 
During post-study survival follow-up, deaths attributed to progression of NSCLC will be 
recorded only on the Survival and Study Termination CRF pages.  
f. Preexisting Medical Conditions 
A preexisting medical condition is one that is present at the start of the study.  Such 
conditions should be recorded on the Medical and Surgical History CRF page. 
A preexisting medical condition should be re-assessed throughout the trial and recorded 
as an AE or SAE only if
 the frequency, severity, or character of the condition worsens 
during the study.  When recording such events on an AE or SAE CRF page, it is important to convey the concept that the preexisting condition has changed by including 
applicable descriptors (e.g., “more frequent
 headaches”). 
g. Hospitalizations for Medical or Surgical Procedures 
Any AE that results in hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization should be documented 
and reported as an SAE. 
If a patient is hospitalized to undergo a medical or surgical procedure as a result of an 
AE, the event responsible for the procedure, not the procedure itself, should be recorded as the SAE.  For example, if a patient is hospitalized to undergo coronary bypass surgery, record the heart condition that necessitated the bypass on the SAE CRF page. 
Hospitalizations for the following reasons will not be recorded as SAEs on the CRF. 
• Hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization for diagnostic or elective surgical 
procedures for preexisting conditions 
• Hospitalization or prolonged hospitalizati on required to allow efficacy measurement 
for the study or 
 
Bevacizumab and Erlotinib—Genentech, Inc. 
82/P OSI3364g-A6 Investigators will submit written reports of all SAEs, regardless of attribution, to 
Genentech within 24 hours of learning of the events.  For initial SAE reports, 
investigators should record all case details that can be gathered within 24 hours on a 
MedWatch 3500 form .  The completed MedWatch 3500 form and SAE Fax Cover Sheet 
should be faxed immediately upon completion to Genentech’s Drug Safety Department 
at: 
(650) 225-4682 
or  
(650) 225-5288 
Relevant follow-up information should be submitted to Genentech’s Drug Safety as soon as it becomes available and/or upon request. 
Note:  All non-U.S. sites were closed prior to the enactment of Amendment 6. 
5.5 TYPE AND DURATION OF FOLLOW-UP OF PATIENTS AFTER 
ADVERSE EVENTS 
All SAEs that are encountered during the protocol-specified AE reporting period should 
be followed to their resolutions, or until the investigator assesses them as stable, or the 
patient is lost to follow-up.  Resolution of SAEs (with dates) should be documented via a 
MedWatch  FDA 3500 form.   
For some SAEs, the Sponsor or its designee may follow-up by telephone, fax, electronic 
mail, and/or a monitoring visit to obtain additional case details deemed necessary to 
appropriately evaluate the SAE report (e.g., hospital discharge summary, consultant report, or autopsy report). 
The safety data collected after the final analysis of OSI3364g will be reviewed on a 
regular basis by Genentech or its agent.  The findings will be recorded in the annual Investigator’s Brochure.  If a new safety signal  is identified, a safety evaluation following 
Genentech standard operating procedures (SOPs) will be conducted and the data reported in keeping with the SOP guidance. 
6. INVESTIGATOR REQUIREMENTS

6.3 INFORMED CONSENT 
The Informed Consent Form has been revised to reflect the changes made to the protocol 
under Amendment 6.  Following submission and IRB approval of Amendment 6, only those patients who are currently receiving study treatment will be required to be 
reconsented with the amended Informed Consent Form. 
Sample Informed Consent Forms will be provided to each site.  Genentech or its 
designee must review any proposed deviations from the sample Informed Consent Form.  The final IRB/EC-approved document must be provided to Genentech for regulatory purposes. 
The Informed Consent Form must be signed by the patient or the patient’s legally 
authorized representative before his or her participation in the study.  The case history for each patient shall document that informed consent was obtained prior to participation in the study.  A copy of the Informed Consent Form must be provided to the patient or the patient’s legally authorized representativ e.  If applicable, it will be provided in a 
certified translation of the local language. 
For patients unable to read or write, the Informed Consent Form should be read to the 
patient by a person other than the patient’s relative/friend or the study staff (e.g., site staff not working on this study). 
 
Bevacizumab and Erlotinib—Genentech, Inc. 
85/P OSI3364g-A6 Signed Informed Consent Form must remain in each patient’s study file and must be 
available for verification by study monitors at any time. 
6.4 INSTITUTIONAL REVIEW BOARD OR ETHICS COMMITTEE 
APPROVAL 
This protocol, the Informed Consent Form, and relevant supporting information must be submitted to the IRB/EC for review and must be approved before the study is initiated.  In addition, any advertising materials
 must be approved by the IRB/EC.  The study will 
be conducted in accordance with U.S. FDA, applicable national and local health authority, and IRB/EC requirements. 
The Principal Investigator is responsible for keeping the IRB/EC apprised of the progress 
of the study and of any changes made to the protocol as deemed appropriate, but in any case the IRB/EC must be updated at least once a year.  The Principal Investigator must also keep the IRB/EC informed of any significant AEs. 
Investigators are required to promptly notify their respective IRB/EC of all adverse drug 
reactions that are both serious and unexpected.  This generally refers to SAEs that are not already identified in the Investigator Brochure and that are considered by the investigator to be possibly or probably related to the study drug.  Some IRBs or ECs may have other specific adverse event requirements to which investigators are expected to adhere.  Investigators must immediately forward to their IRB/EC any written safety report or update provided by Genentech (e.g., IND safety report, Investigator Brochure, safety amendments and updates, etc.). 
6.5 STUDY MONITORI NG REQUIREMENTS 
Site visits will be conducted by Genentech or an authorized Genentech representative to inspect study data, patients’ medical records, and CRFs in accordance with current U.S. GCPs and the respective local and national government regulations and guidelines (if applicable). 
The Principal Investigator will permit authorized representatives of Genentech, the U.S. 
FDA, and the respective national or local health authorities to inspect facilities and records relevant to this study.  
Upon enactment of Amendment 6, all necessary study monitoring and site management 
will be performed remotely.  
6.6 CASE REPORT FORMS 
CRFs will be supplied by Genentech and should be handled in accordance with 
instructions from Genentech. 
 
Bevacizumab and Erlotinib—Genentech, Inc. 
86/P OSI3364g-A6 All CRFs should be filled out completely  by examining personnel or the study 
coordinator.  The CRF should be reviewed, signed, and dated by the investigator. 
All CRFs should be completed in a neat, legible manner to ensure accurate 
interpretation of data.  Black ink is required to ensure clarity of reproduced CRF copies.  When making changes or corrections, cross out the original entry with a single line, and initial and date the change.  DO NOT ERASE, OVERWRITE, OR USE CORRECTION 
FLUID ON THE ORIGINAL. 
6.7 SOURCE DATA DOCUMENTATION 
Study monitors will perform ongoing source data verification (SDV) to confirm that critical protocol data (i.e., source data) transcribed on the CRFs by authorized site personnel are accurate, complete, and verifiable from source documents. 
Source documents are where patient data are recorded and documented for the first 
time.  They include, but are not limited to, hospital records, clinical and office charts, laboratory notes, memoranda, patient diaries or evaluation checklists, pharmacy dispensing records, recorded data from automated instruments, copies of transcriptions that are certified after verification as being accurate and complete, microfiche, photographic negatives, microfilm or magnetic media, X-rays, patient files, and records kept at the pharmacy, laboratories, and medico-technical departments involved in a clinical trial. 
Source documents that are required to verify the validity and completeness of data 
transcribed on the CRFs must never be obliterated or destroyed. 
To facilitate SDV, the investigator(s) and institution(s) must provide the Sponsor direct 
access to applicable source documents and reports for trial-related monitoring, Sponsor audits, and IRB/EC review.  The investigational site must also allow inspection by applicable regulatory authorities. 
6.8 USE OF COMPUTERIZED SYSTEMS 
When clinical observations are entered directly into an investigational site’s computerized medical record system (i.e., in lieu of original hardcopy records), the electronic record can serve as the source document if the system has been validated in accordance with FDA requirements pertaining to computerized systems used in clinical 
research.  An acceptable computerized data collection system (for clinical research purposes) would be one that (1) allows data entry only by authorized individuals; (2) prevents ability to delete or alter previously entered data and provides an audit trail for such data changes (e.g., modification of file); (3) protects the database from tampering; and (4) ensures data preservation. 
In collaboration with the study monitor,  Genentech’s Computer Systems Compliance 
group will assess whether electronic records generated from computerized medical 
 
Bevacizumab and Erlotinib—Genentech, Inc. 
87/P OSI3364g-A6 record systems used at investigational sites can serve as source documents for the 
purposes of this protocol. 
If a site’s computerized medical record system is not adequately validated for the 
purposes of clinical research (as opposed to general clinical practice), applicable hardcopy source documents will need to be maintained to ensure that critical protocol data that are transcribed on the CRFs can be verified. 
6.9 STUDY MEDICATION ACCOUNTABILITY 
All study drug required for completion of this study will be provided by Genentech  and 
Astellas Pharmaceuticals .  The recipient will acknowledge receipt of the drug by 
returning the enclosed paperwork that is received with study medication shipments .  
Damaged supplies will be replaced. 
Accurate records of all study drug dispensed from and returned to the study site should 
be recorded by using the Drug Inventory Log. 
All partially used or empty containers should be disposed of at the study site according 
to institutional standard operating procedure only after study drug reconciliation has been performed and disposal has been authorized by a Genentech representative.   
All forms will be supplied by Genentech. 
6.10 DISCLOSURE OF DATA 
Patient medical information obtained by this st udy is confidential, and disclosure to third 
parties other than those noted below is prohibited. 
Upon the patient’s permission, medical information may be given to his or her personal 
physician or other appropriate medical personnel responsible for his or her welfare. 
Data generated by this study must be available for inspection upon request by 
representatives of the U.S. FDA, national and local health authorities, Genentech, and the IRB/EC for each study site, if appropriate. 
6.11 RETENTION OF RECORDS 
U.S. FDA regulations (21 CFR §312.62[c]) and the International Council on Harmonisation (ICH) Guideline for Good Clinical Practice (see Section 4.9 of the guideline) require that records and documents pertaining to the conduct of this study and the distribution of investigational drug, including CRFs,  consent forms, laboratory test results, and medication inventory records, must be retained by the Principal Investigator for 2 years after the last marketing application approval in an ICH region or after at least 2 years have elapsed since formal 
discontinuation of clinical development of t he investigational product.  All state and local 
 
Bevacizumab and Erlotinib—Genentech, Inc. 
88/P OSI3364g-A6 laws for retention of records also apply.  Genentech will notify the Principal Investigator 
of these events. 
No records should be disposed of without the written approval of Genentech. 
For studies conducted outside the United States under a U.S. IND, the Principal 
Investigator must comply with U.S. FDA IND regulations and with those of the relevant national and local health authorities.

Final Study Results 
Final Study Results  
A Phase III, multicenter, placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized, clinical trial to 
evaluate the efficacy of bevacizumab (Avastin®) in combination with erlotinib (Tarceva®) 
compared with erlotinib alone for treatment of advanced non −small cell lung cancer 
(NSCLC) after failure of standard first-line chemotherapy (BETA).   
Authors:   J Hainsworth1, M Lin2, P O’Connor2, and R Herbst3 for the BETA Lung 
Investigators (1 Sarah Cannon Research Institute, Nashville TN, 2 Genentech, Inc., San 
Francisco, CA, 3 MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston TX) 
Background:  Bevacizumab (B) with chemotherapy and erlotinib (E) monotherapy have 
demonstrated a survival benefit in the treatment of patients (pts) with advanced NSCLC (Sandler et al. NEJM 2006; Shepherd et al. NEJM 2005).  Randomized Phase II data supported the hypothesis that combining B
 + E might improve efficacy, with acceptable 
safety (Herbst et al. JCO 2007).   
Methods:  Patients with advanced NSCLC who progressed during or after first-line 
therapy were enrolled.  The primary endpoint of  the trial was overall survival (OS).  
Secondary endpoints included PFS and ORR.  Eligible patients were B appropriate, including a group with treated brain metastases, squamous cell disease at low risk for bleeding, and those requiring anticoagulation.  Previous anti-angiogenisis or epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) targeted therapy was not allowed.  Patients were randomized (1:1) to B
 + E or E  + placebo (P).  E dosing was 150 mg daily.  B/P dosing 
was 15 mg/kg intravenous every 3 weeks.  Responses were assessed every 6 weeks until Week 24 and every 12 weeks thereafter.  Treatment continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.   
Results:  636 patients were enrolled from June 2005 to April 2008.  The final analysis 
was conducted after 418 deaths were recorded.  Median OS was 9.3 mos (B
 + E) vs. 
9.2 months (E+P), p = 0.75, HR=0.97(95% CI: 0.80 -1.18).  Median PFS was 3.4 mos (B+E) vs. 1.7 mos (E+P), p<0.0001; HR
 = 0.62 (95%CI: 0.52-0.75).  ORR was 12.6% 
(B+E) vs.6.2% (E+P), p=0.006.  The safety profile for B+E was consistent with known profiles for B and E and will be described further at presentation.  Conclusions:  The addition of B to E in the BETA lung study was not associated with an improvement overall survival.  However, B
 + E doubled PFS and ORR, providing clear evidence of 
clinical activity.

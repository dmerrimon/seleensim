Version 3.0Incorporating Substantial Amendment s 1 & 2Definition of Key Study Terms
Terms Definition of terms
Baseline Observed values/findings which are regarded observed starting point for 
comparison. 
Clinical response for 
subjects aged from 
birth to < 2 years Absence of watery diarrhea for 2 consecutive days during treatment and 
subjects remain well until the time of study drug discontinuation (initial 
clinical response). 
In addition, subjects should not require further CDAD therapy within 2 days 
after completion of study drug (confirmed clinical response). Resolution of 
diarrhea is assessed during interviews of the subject/parent/legal guardian 
supplemented by a review of the subject’s personal records for the day (if 
hospitalized), and the presence of watery diarrhea.
Clinical response for 
subjects aged ≥ 2 
years to < 18 yearsImprovement in the number and character of bowel movements as 
determined by < 3 unformed bowel movements (UBMs) per day for 2 
consecutive days during treatme nt and subjects remain well until the time of 
study drug discontinuation (initial clinical response). 
In addition, subjects should not require further CDAD therapy 2 days after 
completion of study drug (confirmed clinical response). Resolution of 
diarrhea is assessed during interviews of the subject/parent/legal guardian, 
supplemented by a review of the subject’s personal records for the day (if 
hospitalized), and the number of UBMs.
Enroll To register or enter into a clinical trial. NOTE: Once a subject has been 
enrolled, the clinical trial protocol applies to the subject. 
End of Study The end of the study is defined as the date of the last subject’s last visit /TC. 
Intervention The drug, therapy or process under investigation in a clinical study that is 
believed to have an effect on outcomes of interest in a study. (e.g., health -
related quality of life, efficacy, safety, pharmacoeconomics).
Investigational period Period of time where major interests of protocol objectives  are observed, and 
where the test drug or comparative drug is given to a subject, and continues 
until the last assessment after completing administration of the test drug or

Date and Version # of Protocol Synopsis: 21 July 2015 / Version 3.0
Sponsor: Astellas Pharma Europe BV (APEB) Protocol Number: 2819 -CL-0202
Name of Study Drug: Fidaxomicin Phase of Development: 3
Title of Study:  
A Phase 3, Multicenter , Investigator -blind , Randomized, Parallel Group Study to Investigate the 
Safety and Efficacy of Fidaxomicin Oral Suspension or Tablets Taken q12h, andVancomycin Oral 
Liquid or Capsules Taken q6h, for 10 Days in Pediatric Subjects with Clostridium difficile -
associated Diarrhea
Planned Study Period: 
From 3Q 20 14to 2Q 2017
Study Objective(s): 
The primary objective of this study is to investigate the clinical response to fidaxomicin oral 
suspension or tablets and vancomycin oral liquid or capsules of pediatric subjects with Clostridium 
difficile -associated diarrhea (CDAD) from birth to < 18 year sof age .
Planned Total Number of Study Centers and Location(s):  
Approximately 65-80 centers in North America and Europe .
Study Population:  
Male and female subjects from birth to < 18 years of age , diagnosed with CDAD confirmed by a 
positive C.difficile toxin test in stool or positive detection of toxigenic C. difficile in stool .
Number of Subjects to be Enrolled:  
144 subjects from birth to <18 years of age will be enrolled with at least 24 subjects in each of the 
following age categories: birth to <24 months , ≥2 years to < 6 years , ≥6 years to < 12 years ,and 
≥12 years to < 18 years (the remaining 48 subjects can be enrolled in any of the age groups).
Study Design Overview :  
This multicenter , investigator -blind , randomized parallel group study will investigate the safety 
and efficacy of a 10- day course of fidaxomicin oral suspension or tablets anda 10-day course of 
vancomycin oral liquid or capsules in subjects from birth to <18 years of age with confirmed 
CDAD. Note that in the United States of America subjects can only be included if aged ≥ 6 months 
to < 18 years.
One hundred forty four subjects, stratified by age at enrollment ( birth to < 24 months, ≥ 2years to 
<6 years, ≥ 6 years to < 12 years, and ≥ 12 years to < 18 years) will be enrolled. A minimum of 24 
subjects will be enrolled into each age group .
Subjects must meet all inclusion criteria, no exclusion criteria, and have been diagnosed with 
CDAD. 
Subjects will be randomized to either fidaxomicin or vancomycin in a 2:1 ratio, stratified by age 
group .
Subjects from birth to <6 years of age will be randomized to receive weight based doses of either 
fidaxomicin oral suspension (32 mg/kg/day with a ma ximum dose of 400 mg/day, divided in 
2doses) 2 times daily for 10 days, or vancomycin oral liquid (40 mg/kg/day with a maximum dose 
of 500 mg/day divided in 4doses) 4 times daily for 10 days.

Version 3.0Incorporating Substantial Amendment s 1 & 2Study Design Overview continued :  
Subjects aged ≥ 6years to<18 years of age will be randomized to receive a 200 mg fidaxomicin 
tablet 2times daily for 10 days, or a 125 mg vancomycin capsule 4 times daily for 10 days. If a 
subject aged ≥ 6years to <18 years is unable to swallow tablets or capsules, the invest igator can 
decide to give fidaxomicin oral suspension, at adose of 400 mg/day, or vancomycin oral liquid at a
dose of 500 mg/day.
Plasma and stool samples will be analyzed for fidaxomicin and its main metabolite OP -1118 
concentrations. For subjects recei ving fidaxomicin, t wo blood samples will be taken on any day 
between Day 5 and 10 inclusive. Every effort should be made to take these samples in conjunction 
with routine blood samples being taken for standard of care. However ,one sample should be 
collect ed within 30 minutes pre -dose and another between 1 to 5 hours post-dose. The two samples 
do not have to be collected on the same day. For all subjects a stool sample will be taken between 
Day 5 and 10 inclusive, within 24 hours of a dose .
At End of Treatment ( EOT ), subjects will be evaluated for initial clinical response (see Definition 
of Key Study Terms section) and two days thereafter for confirmed clinical response. Clinic al 
responses will be based on the investigator’s assessment of clinical par ameters, most importantly 
resolution of diarrhea and the need for further treatment for CDAD. 
Subjects without initial clinical response at EOT will enter the Follow -up period for safety (adverse 
events) and will be contacted (visit or telephone call [TC] ) at EOS (EOT +30 days ).
Subjects without confirmed clinical response at EOT + 2 days will continue in the Follow -up 
period for safety (adverse events) and will be contacted (visit or TC) at EO S.
Subjects who have a confirmed clinical response will be followed for recurrence and sustained 
clinical response (see Defi nition of Key Study Terms section) throughout the F ollow -up period, 
with weekly visits or TCs. At the end of the 30 day F ollow -up period the EOS TC / visit will take 
place.
If diarrhea recurs during the Follow -up period an Unscheduled visit will take place for reassess -
ment of CDAD recurrence. If recurrence is confirmed, subjects will continue in the Follow -up 
period for safety (adverse events) andwill be contacted (visit or TC) at the EOS.
Incase of discontinuation of study drug before completion of the full 10 -day treatment course ,the 
subject should complete the EOT visit as soon as possible after the last drug administration . If at 
this visit, subject has an initial clinical response, the subject will continue in the Follow -up period
for safety and efficacy unless consent has been withdrawn .
CDAD status will be assessed by interviews with the subject/parent/legal guardian (or hospital staff 
e.g. when hospitalized). These interviews will be conducted in the morning, daily during the 
treatment period through the End of Treatment and at EOT+2; thereafter weekly at 9, 16 and 23 
days after the EOT, and at End of Study (EOS) EOT + 30 days, following a standardized 
questionnaire. These interviews m ay be conducted by telephone (e.g. when not hospitalized). 
Palatability will be assessed  for all subjects receiving fidaxomicin oral suspension and vancomycin 
oral liquid.
Site and S ponsor staff involved in dispensing , administering or collecting the study drug will be 
unblinded as well as the subject and parents/legal guardians. They will be instructed not to discuss 
the study drug with the blinded staff.
A Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will be established for this study.

Version 3.0Incorporating Substantial Amendment s 1 & 2Drugs to control diarrhea (e.g., loperamide) should also be withheld during the study perio d.
Whenever possible, drugs which could affect peristalsis should be avoided. Subjects receiving 
opioids for pain prior to enrollment may continue to receive the same opi oidand dose during the 
treatment phase if required. 
Duration of Treatment:  
10 days
Definitions :
Clinical response for subjects aged from birth to < 2 years is defined as: Absence of watery 
diarrhea for 2 consecutive days during treatment and subjects remain well until the time of study 
drug discontinuation (initial clinical response). In addition, subjects should not require further 
CDAD therapy within 2 days after completion of study drug (confirmed clinical response). 
Resolution of diarrhea is assessed during interviews of the subject/parent/legal guardian 
supplemented by a review of the subject’s personal records for the day (if hospitalized), and the 
presence of watery diarrhea.
Clinical response for subjects aged ≥ 2 years to < 18 years is defined as:  Improvement in the 
number and character of bowel movements as determin ed by < 3 unformed bowel movements 
(UBMs) per day for 2 consecutive days during treatment and subjects remain well until the time of 
study drug discontinuation (initial clinical response). In addition, subjects should not require further 
CDAD therapy 2 days after completion of study drug (confirmed clinical response). Resolution of 
diarrhea is assessed during interviews of the subject/parent/legal guardian, supplemented by a 
review of the subject’s personal records for the day (if hospitalized), and the num ber of UBMs.
Time to resolution of diarrhea (TTROD) for subjects aged from birth to < 2 years is defined as:  
the time elapsing (in hours rounded up from minutes > 30) from the start of treatment (time of first 
dose of study medication) to resolution of di arrhea (time of last episode of watery diarrhea the day 
prior to the first of 2 consecutive days without watery diarrhea that was sustained through EOT).
Time to resolution of diarrhea (TTROD ) for subjects aged ≥ 2 years to < 18 years is defined 
as:  the time elapsing (in hours rounded up from minutes >30) from the start of treatment (time of 
first dose of study medication) to resolution of diarrhea (time of the last UBM the day prior to the 
first of 2 consecutive days of < 3 UBMs that are sustained throug h EOT).
Recurrence for subjects aged from birth to < 2 years is defined as: the re- establishment of watery 
diarrhea after confirmed clinical response to an extent that is greater than that noted on the last day 
of study drug with the demonstration of a positive direct or indirect testing for the presence of 
toxigenic C.difficile in stool and that, in the investigator's opinion, would require retreatment with 
CDAD anti -infective therapy.
Recurrence for subjects aged ≥ 2 years < 18 years is defined as: the re -establishment of diarrhea 
after confirmed clinical response to an extent (as measured by the frequency of passed unformed 
stools) that is greater than that noted on the last day of study drug with the demonstration of a 
positive direct or indirect testing for the presence of toxigenic C.difficile in stool and that, in the 
investigator's opinion, would require retreatment with CDAD anti -infective therapy.
Time to recurrence is defined as: the time (days) from confirmed clinical response until the ons et 
of recurrence as defined above.
Sustained clinical response is defined as : Confirmed clinical response (EOT + 2 days) without 
CDAD recurrence until the time of assessment during the Follow -up period.

Version 3.0Incorporating Substantial Amendment s 1 & 2g)At EOT, the clinical response will be assessed. All subjects will continue i n the Follow -up period. 
Subjects that have no clinical response will only be contacted at EOT +30 days for safety (adverse events).
h)Two day s after EOT, a telephone contact with the subject/parent/legal guardian or a visit (if the subject is still in the h ospital) w ill take place for all subjects w ith an initial clinical 
response at EOT to confirm the clinical response. All subjects will continue in the 30 -day Follow -up period. Subjects w ithout a confirmed clinical response will only be contacted 
at EOT +30 days for safety (adverse events).
i)At 9, 16 and 23 days after EOT, for subjects who had confirmed clinical response; the subject/parent/legal guardian will be c ontacted by phone. 
j)For subjects w ith a recurrence of diarrhea during the Follow -up period, an Unscheduled visit is mandatory, including a stool sample. The stool sample will be split in two aliquots 
one for detection of toxigenic C.difficile at site and one for the reference lab (for possible microbiological and biochemistry testing), for reassessment of CDAD (as per protocol 
criteria). Subjects w ith recurrence of CDAD will after the Unscheduled visit continue in the Follow -up period and w ill only be contacted at EOT +30 days for safety (adverse 
events).
k)30 days after  EOT, the EOS TC/visit will take place. For subjects that had a confirmed clinical response at EOT +2 days and did not experience a recurrence during the Follow -up 
period, all assessments will be done, including sustained clinical response assessment. For all other subjects a telephone call (TC) w ill be done for safety (adverse events) .
l)Unscheduled visits could take place throughout the study period, if deemed necessary by the investigator. Only those assessme ntsthat are relevant according to the investigators 
opinion should be performed. How ever, evaluation of adverse events (AE) and concomitant medication is mandatory. 
m)Stool sample will be split in two aliquots, one for the detection of toxigenic C. difficile at study site and one for the reference laboratory (for possible microbiological and 
biochemistry testing). Alternatively, a test for toxigenic C. difficile done as standard of care, including pre- consent samples, provided the sample was obtained within 72 hours 
prior to randomization, may be used to assess eligibility and a different sample sent to the reference laboratory.
n)For subjects receiving fidaxomicin, tw
o blood samples will be taken on any day between Day 5 and 10 inclusive. Every effort s hould be made to take these samples in conjunction 
with routine blood samples being taken for standard of care. How ever one sample should be collected w ithin 30 minutes pre- dose and another between 1 to 5 hours post -dose. The 
two samples do not have to be collected on the same day. 
o)For all subjects a stool sample w ill be taken between Day 5 and 10 inclusive, within 24 hours of a dose.
p)For subjects receiving fidaxomicin oral suspension or vancomycin oral liquid palatability assessment will be performed on Day 1 and Day 7 
(± 1 day).
q)Two ECGs will be performed. One at screening prior to the first dose of study drug and another 1 to 5 hours post- dose (the morning or evening dose for the fidaxomicin arm, or the

Version 3.0Incorporating Substantial Amendment s 1 & 21 INTRODUCTION
1.1 Back ground
Fidaxomicin is a macrolide (18 -membered macrocy cle) antibacterial drug produced by  
Dactylosporangium aurantiacum , and has a highly  potent y et narrow -spectrum bactericidal 
activity  against Clostridium diff icile.Fidaxomicin was approved b y the Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) in May  2011 for the U nited States (US) and in December 2011 by  the 
European Committee for the Europe an Union (EU) for the treatment of C.difficile infection 
(CDI) also known as C. difficile -associated diarrhea (CDAD) in adults, and is now being 
developed for use in pediatric patients with the same condition. 
CDAD is the most common cause of nosocomial diarrhea in developed countries .The 
disease accounts for approximately  20% of cases of an tibiotic -associated diarrhea, and for the 
majority  of cases of antibiotic -associated pseudomembranous colitis [Blanckaert et al, 2008; 
Calfee 2008; Monaghan et al, 2008; My lonakis et al, 2001 ].Although ty pically  associated 
with hospitals and long -term car e facilities, CD ADmay also be acquired in the community .  
While not nearly as common as hospital -acquired CD AD, community -acquired CD ADis 
afflicting otherwise healthy  people with no recent history  of hospital admission or antibiotic 
use[Monaghan et al, 2008; Bartlett, 2006; Kuijper et al, 2006; My lonakis et al, 2001]. One 
study  reported that approximately  50% of patients with CD ADwho visited a general 
practitioner in 2006 acquired the disease outside of a healthcare setting [Weil et al, 2007 ]
C. diffici leis a spore -forming, anaerobic, gram- positive bacillus. CD AD is caused b y an 
overgrowth of C. difficile in the colon often resulting from antibiotic use that disrupts the 
beneficial microflora found in the gut, allowing C. difficile to proliferate. The r ising 
incidence of CD ADhas been attributed to the frequent prescription of broad -spectrum
antibiotics to hospitalized patients, the increasing incidence of virulent strains (such as the 
North American PFGE pulse -field gel electrophoresis type 1 [NAP1] /restriction endo -
nuclease anal ysis type BI ( Epidemic h ypervirulent C. difficile strain)/ Polymerase C hain 
Reaction riboty pe 027 or NAP1/BI/027), [Kuijper et al, 2006; Kuijper et al, 2008] or less 
commonly  to cancer chemotherapy [Feket y, 1997] . Antibiotics 
commonly  linked to CDAD 
include ampicillin, amoxicillin, clindamy cin, fluoroquinolones, and cephalosporins,
[Wistrom et al, 2001; Fekety, 1997] but almost all antibiotics can induce CDAD.  Once 
overgrown, C.difficile produces harmful toxins that can cause a variet y of complications, 
including pseudomembranous colitis, toxic megacolon, perforations of the colon, and sepsis, 
and can cause or contribute to death in up to 14.4% of cases [Loo et al, 2005]. Recent reports 
mostly  in adults suggest that CDAD is evolving into a more severe disease. Outbreaks of 
CDAD with increased morbidity  and mortalit y have been described in North America and in 
the EU [Ackermann et al, 2004 ].These outbreaks were associated with the emergence and 
dissemination of a hy pervirulent strain characterized as toxinoty peIII, NAP1/BI /027. The 
NAP1/BI/027 strain has been reported in the US, Canada, and Northern Europe [Blanckaert 
et al, 2008; Calfee 2008; Kuijper et al, 2006]. This strain is thought to be responsible for 
increasing morbidit y and mortality . It contains an 18- base pair tcdC deletion, and has been 
shown in vitro to produce 16 to 23 times more toxins A and B than other strains [Monaghan

Version 3.0Incorporating Substantial Amendment s 1 & 2et al, 2008; Credito & Appelbaum, 2004] .To date, hy pervirulent strains of C. difficile have 
been identified in the US, Canada, Japan, and many other countries, and are of increasing 
concern [Kuijper et al, 2008].
CDADhas long been considered a disease of adults and not a clinical problem in children
[McFarland et al, 2000; Larson et al, 1982] . It is unclear whether typical CD ADoccurs in 
children under 2 years of age. Even in older children, CD ADis associated with variable 
diarrheal sy mptoms, with some reports stating that CD ADrarely causes severe diarrhea in 
childre n [Vernacchio et al, 2006; Sp ivack et al, 2003] . However, other studies have shown 
the presence of C.difficile in a significant number of older children presenting with diarrhea; 
27.3% of hospitalized children with diarrhea had a positive C.difficile test in a study  in the 
US[Kader et al, 1998].
Recently , the disease has been recognized to be increasing in children and y ounger adults with a 
significant proportion of these cases exhibiting the onset of sy mptoms in the community  [DuPont 
et al, 2008; Benson et al, 2007] . These observat ions along with the emergence of a more virulent 
and possibly  more transmissible strain (NAP1/BI/027) prompted the initiation of population -
based surveillance s ystems for CDAD. The preliminary  data now emerging from these 
surveillance s ystems, as well as data from hospital discharge records confirm that prevalence of 
CDAD in pediatric populations is much lower than in adults, but is steadily  increasing. The most 
recent data indicate that the incidence/prevalence of CDAD in children in the US has likely  
reached a rate of approximately  20,000 cases annually  [Kuijper et al, 2008].
The most recent data on population- based surveillance of CDAD in children in the US were 
reported b y Kast and colleagues at the recent 2010 I nternational Conference on Emerging 
Infectious Diseases [Kast et al, 2010]. 
The investigator s reported the incidence of CD ADin 2009 from 2distinct catchment areas:  
fivemetropolitan counties in Colorado and four rural counties in Minnesota. The anal ysis 
captured both healthcare facility -onset disease and community -onset disease. The overall 
incidence of CD ADin individuals aged 1 -17 years was similar between the two areas. In the 
urban centers in Colorado, the rate was 16 per 100,000, whereas in the rural counties , the rate 
was 21 per 100,000. Adjusting for the regional differences in CD ADprevalence described b y 
Elixhauser and Jhung [ Elixhauser & Jhung, 2011] ,the rates in each surveillance area closel y 
approximate to20 per 100,000.a  The inclusion of both rural and metropolitan populations 
and the similarity  of the results across populations support the generalizability  of the data to 
the general US pediatric population. Thus, using current US census data for individuals under 
18 years of age (i.e., 74,548,215 persons aged under 5 years through 17 years) y ields a 
national incidence of approximately  15,000 cases per year based on both the rural and 
metropolitan data.
                                                
aWhen regional CDAD rates (all ages combined) w ere evaluated, the rate in the Midwest (including Minnesota) 
was slightly higher than the overall national rate (83 versus 79.3 per 100,000; 5% higher) whereas the rate in the 
West (including Colorado) w as som ewhat lower than th e national rate (62 versus 79.3 per 100,000; 20% low er).  
Adjusting the rate of 21 per 100,000 from Minnesota by 5% results in a rate of 20 per 100,0 00.  Adjusting the 
rate of 16 per 100,00 0from Colorado upw ard by  20% also results in a rate of 20 per 100, 000.

Version 3.0Incorporating Substantial Amendment s 1 & 2Lower national CD ADrates were obtained b y McDonald and colleagues based on data on 
discharges from short -stay hospitals from a period approximately  10 y ears prior to that 
covered b y Kast and colleagues [Kast et al, 2010; McDonald, 2006]. In the McDonald study , 
diagnoses of intestinal infection due to Clostridium difficile (ICD-9 code 8.45) between 1996 
and 2003 from the Nation al Hospital Discharge Survey  (NHDS) database were used to 
estimate national rates. The NHDS consists of diagnosis and demographic data collected from 
a national probability  sample of patient discharge records from approximately  500 hospitals. 
An algorithm (SUDAAN ™) was used to estimate national rates. Although this study  included 
adults as well as children, rates were anal yzed by age groups. The point estimate rate for 
patients <15 y ears was 9/ 100,000 (95% CI 5-9 per 100,000). Using US census data on 
indivi duals <15 years (61,882,854 persons aged under 5 years throu gh 14 yearsb), the point 
estimate of the national rate in the years between 1993 and 2003 is 5,570 cases/y ear.
The increase in the incidence of pediatric CD ADbetween time periods covered b y the 
McDonald and Kast studies is supported by  an analy sis of pediatric hospitalization data by  
Zilberberg [ Zilberberg , 2009 ]. Using the Kid’s Inpatient Database (KID) and the NHDS 
database, the incidence of CD ADdiagnoses between 1997 and 2006 was evaluated. T he KID 
database represents 3,789 hospitals from 38 states and the NHDS database covers discharges 
from about 5000 non institutional, nonfederal, short -stay hospitals in the US .The most recent 
data from this study  (2006 data) indicated that the rate of CD ADamong hospitalized children 
in the US was 12.8 per 10,000 hospitalizations based o n KID data and 14.03 per 
10,000 hospitalizatio ns based on the NHDS database.
The actual number of cases calculated b y Zilverberg does not deviate greatly  from the 
national estimates calculated in the McDonald study  [McDonald et al, 2006] using data from 
1996 to2003.
Relatively  recent multi -hospital rates of CD ADin pediatric populations were also reported b y 
Kim [ Kim et al, 2008 ].This study examined the rate of CD ADat 22 free -standing children’s 
hospitals from major metropolitan areas in the US from 2001 to 2006 using data from the 
Pediatric Health Information Sy stem (PHI S) database .During the stud y period, investigator s 
identified a total of 4,895 pediatric patien ts with CD ADat the children’s hospitals.  Based on 
this data they report rates of 4.4 cases per 10,000 patient day s in 2001 and 6.5 cases per 
10,000 patient day s in 2006. The annual incidence de nsity  per 1,000 admissions was 2.6 in 
2001 and 4.0 in 2006. I nsufficient data are available on the denominator used in this study  to 
estimate the annual number of cases nationwide based on these findings. The same study  
showed a mortalit y rate of 3.8% in children with CDAD.
Although community -onset disease is an impetus for the development of population -based 
surveillance, it is likely  that hospital discharge data capture the majorit y of this segment of 
the CD ADpopulation because community- onset disease is most ty picall y diagnosed in 
conjunction with a visit to the hospital emergency room. The extent to which re- infection 
accounts for potential double-counting is unknown.

Version 3.0Incorporating Substantial Amendment s 1 & 2The etiology  in children is the same as in adults with one major difference: children, 
particularl y those < 2 years of age, frequently  harbor C. di fficile while being clinically  
asymptomatic. In addition, unlike in adults and older children with CDAD ,the exclusion of 
other causes of diarrhea is not as conclusive in neonates and young babies < 6months because 
children often have underly ing gastrointestinal or immunologic diseases and children are more 
susceptible to infection by  viral diarrhea agents, for example rotavirus, many  of which cannot 
be cultured at all or only in sophisticated research labs.  
Several studies have been carried out to d etermine the culture rates in fe ces of C. difficile in 
children with and without diarrhea, with these studies showing variable culture rates and no 
apparent association between a positive culture and clinical diagnosis. I n newborn infants in 
particular (i.e., <1 month old), the occurrence of positive cultures varied widely , from 4% in 
Sweden ,11% in France , 25% in t he Netherlands, 31% in the US , 67% in Belgium , and 71% 
in the UK [Penders et al, 2006; Enad et al, 1997; Collignon et al, 1993; Delmee et al, 1988;
Al-Jumaili et al, 1984; Holst et al, 1981 ].It should be noted that these results were seen in all 
newborns, with no direct correlation to the presence of diarrhea.
A 1989 study  demonstrated that C. difficile -positive cultures were obtained at a similar 
frequency  from infants of less than 1 year of age both with and without diarrhea (32.5% 
compared to 27.9%, difference not significant, p=0.44) [ Karsch et al, 1989 ]. Similarly , 
Vernacchio and colleagues demonstra ted that 3.5% ofhealth y children (aged 6 to 36 months) 
had positive C.difficile cultures, whereas the proportion of children with positive C. difficile
cultures plus diarrhea was only  1.9% (p=0.12) [ Vernacchio et al, 2006 ]. In a Finnish study , 
the preval ence of positive cultures was compared between hospitalized children with diarrhea 
(21.1%) to an y hospitalized children (32.7%) [Vesikari et al, 1984 ].In this study  newborns 
and infants were included (i.e., patients of 0 to 2 years).
Taken together, it is clear that y oung children of all age groups frequentl y harbor C.difficile
and tolerate the presence of C.difficile, but can be clinically as ymptomatic and not develop 
CDAD. The presence of intestinal colonization with C.difficile does not necessaril y correlate 
with diarrhea in this age group.
As a possible scientific rationale for the differences in colonization and incidence of CD AD
seen in y oung children compared to adults, it has been suggested that neonates and infants do 
not respond to c lostridial toxins in the same way  as adults do [Tullus et al, 1989 ].Though the 
mechanism for this difference is unclear, h ypotheses include the inability of immature 
receptors to bind or respond to the toxins, transference of protective maternal antibodies, and 
the inability  of the infant’s immune sy stem to mount an effective immune response.
Patients are currentl y treated b y discontinuation of the offending medication, as well as 
supportive therap y, but antimicrobial therap y is required if these measures fail to con trol the 
infection (Kell y, 1994; Feket y, 1997). The two most commonly utilized specific therapies are 
vancom ycin and metronidazole, the latter being used off -label. 
Vancom ycin is recommended for first -line treatment of CDAD in severe cases, but not in mil d 
to moderate cases, which represent the majorit y of CDAD patients (Bauer, 2009). Increasing

Version 3.0Incorporating Substantial Amendment s 1 & 2use of vancom ycin has caused some concern as it is the only antibiotic active against some 
serious life -threatening, multi -drug resistant bacteria [Hospital I nfect ion Control Practices 
Advisory  Committee (HICPAC), 1995; Watanabe, 1997]. 
Metronidazole is the recommended treatment for patients with mild to moderate disease 
experiencing a first episode of CDI [American Society  of Health -System Pharmacists 
(ASHP), 1998; Bauer, 2009]. Metronidazole is effective in these subgroups of patients, and 
can be used either orally  or intravenousl y. However, it is near -fully  absorbed in the absence of 
diarrhea, and oral absorption is associated with significant adverse effects inc luding nausea, 
neuropath y, leukopenia, seizures, and a toxic reaction to alcohol [Kelly , 1994; Feket y, 1984, 
Feket y, 1997]. 
Furthermore, its use is discouraged in young children and pregnant women [Yassin, 2001]. 
Finally , several reports have shown a lowe r clinical response rate in severe cases when 
treated with metronidazole treatment compared to vancom ycin [Zar, 2007; Louie, 2007]. The 
current recommendations for CDAD treatment in The Medical Letter and Up -To-Date, and 
endorsed b y the recent guidelines o f the European Society  of Clinical Microbiology  and 
Infectious Diseases (ESCMI D) [Bauer, 2009] and the Society  for Healthcare Epidemiology  
of America and the Infectious Disease Society  of America (SHEA -IDSA) [Cohen, 2010] 
state that vancom ycin, but not metronidazole, should be used to treat severe cases of CDAD. 
Although current CDI treatment options are effective in treating the acute sy mptoms, none of 
the available treatments is without significant problems. I n the case of vancomy cin, these 
problems incl ude high recurrence rate, high risk of acquiring resistant organisms, especially  
VRE. Therap y with metronidazole presents the following problems high recurrence rate, 
higher rate of failures in severe cases compared to vancom ycin, frequent adverse effects.
A major shortcoming of currentl y available antimicrobial treatments for CDI is the typical 
recurrence rate of approximately  20% to 50% [Kyne, 1999; Ky ne, 2001; Aslam, 2005; L ouie, 
2007; L ouie, 2006; Musher, 2006]. A new agent that effectivel y treats CDI and markedl y 
reduces recurrence would be a significant therapeutic advance. 
Fidaxomicin tablets are approved for use in the US and other countries to treat adult subjects 
with CDAD. Also due to the need for a liquid formulation for pediatric patients, an or al 
suspension formulation of fidaxomicin has been developed. 
Data from the recent pediatric PK study with fidaxomicin tablets and oral suspension suggest 
a pharmacokinetic profile that is generally  similar to that observed in adults. The safet y 
observations were consistent with both the underly ing conditions of the subjects and with 
data from prior studies in the adult CDAD population, and suggest that fidaxomicin is well 
tolerated in this population. Fidaxomicin showed strong efficacy  in treating the init ial 
disease, but higher recurrence percentage than observed in prior adult studies .The pharmaco -
kinetic, safet y, and efficacy results observed in this study  support the continuation of 
pediatric development of fidaxomicin.

Version 3.0Incorporating Substantial Amendment s 1 & 21.2 Non-clinical and Clinical Data
1.2.1 Non-Clinical Data
The pharmacology , toxicology  and pharmacokinetics of fidaxomicin have been studied in 
different animal species and in in vitro studies, and have demonstrated the safet y of 
fidaxomicin for human use. 
Juvenile nonclinical studies have been conducted to study  the effect of fidaxomicin on the 
growth and development of major organ s ystems in order to allow clinical studies to be 
performed in pediatric patients with CDAD, ranging from birth to 18 y ears. The 4 -week oral 
repeated- dose toxicity  study in juvenile Beagle dogs showed no target organ for toxicity  and 
fidaxomicin was well tolerated in dogs from Post Natal Day  4, which is the age equivalent a 
newborn child, onwards. Furthermore, no adverse effects were seen on development of an y 
organ s ystem evaluated after 28 day s of dosing up to 200 mg/kg/day  fidaxomicin. Although 
GI tracts were considered to be the most susceptible organ due to the expected high local 
concentrations of fidaxomicin, no histological changes were observed in the GI tract of 
juvenile animals. Fidaxomicin was shown to have the same safety  profile in y oung animals as 
in adult animals. There are no indications for target organs or differences in sensitivity . In 
summary , long term dosing of fidaxomicin up to 200 mg/kg/day  does 
not show adverse 
effects on an y of the developing organ s ystems in juvenile animals and does not indicate an y 
safet y concern for pediatric patients from birth and older.
Full details can be found in the current version of the Investigator’s Brochure (IB) v ersion 9.3.
1.2.2 Clinical Data
The safet y and efficacy  of fidaxomicin have been evaluated in 8 phase 1 studies in healthy  
adult subjects, a phase 2Astudy  conducted in adults with CDAD , 2 phase 3 studies
conducted in adults with CDAD and a recent phase 2A study conducted in children with 
CDAD . All studies have been completed and the data have been anal yzed.Full details can be

1.2.2.1 Phase 1 Studies
In two ascending dose studies ( Studies OPT -80 1A-SD and OPT- 80 1B -MD), following single 
oral doses of 100 to 450 mg and multiple oral doses of 150 to 450 mg of fidaxomi cin to healthy  
adult volunteers, plasma levels of fidaxomicin were near the lower limit of quantification 
[LLOQ ]=5 ng/mL , showing a dose -proportional increase over the dose range studied. Plasma 
elimination half -lives ranged from 0.94 to 2.77 hours. In con trast, normalized to the 150 mg 
dose, fecal concentrations of fidaxomicin reached a mean of 916.0 μg/g (range 138.4 to 1768.9 
μg/g) after 10 day s of dosing. The high fecal concentrations and low s ystemic level are 
consistent with the therapeutic properties of fidaxomicin, which is indicated for local, 
bactericidal effects in the gastrointestinal tract. Overall, fidaxomicin was well tolerated by  all 
subjects at doses up to 450 mg. The adverse events (AEs) were comparable between active and 
placebo over the d ose range studied. There were no clinically  significant abnormalities or drug -
related changes in serum chemistry , hematology , and urinalysis throughout the study  period. 
There were no clinicall y significant abnormalities in hemody namic or electrocardiograp hic 
data collected throughout the study .
Fidaxomicin and its main metabolite, OP -1118, showed maximum plasma concentration (C max) 
values that were 21.5% and 33.4% lower, respectively, in the fed versus the fasted states, while 
extents of exposure (AUC 0-t) were equivalent (Study  OPT -80-005). The frequency , types and 
severities of AEs following the administration of either 200 or 400 mg fidaxomicin indicated 
that it was generally  well tolerated under both fasted and fed conditions. 
In a study  comparing the pharmacokinetics of 200 mg fidaxomicin in Japanese and Caucasian 
healthy  male adults (Study 2819 -CL-3001), Cmax of fidaxomicin and OP -1118 was higher in the 
Japanese group by 70% and 62%, respectively, while AUC 0-last was increased by 28% and 31% 
respecti vely, following a single dose (and similar results were observed after repeated 
administration). As these increases are within the range of exposures observed following dosing

Version 3.0Incorporating Substantial Amendment s 1 & 2with fidaxomicin (200 mg) in clinical studies, and these exposure levels were de monstrated to be 
safe, the increases are not considered clinically significant. Coadministration of the P -
glycoprotein inhibitor cyclosporine with fidaxomicin (Study  OPT -80-007) increased the least 
squares (LS) mean C maxof fidaxomicin and main metabolite OP-1118 by  approximately  
4-fold and 10- fold, respectively , compared to fidaxomicin alone. AUC 0-tfor fidaxomicin and 
OP-1118 were also increased b y cyclosporine, but to a lesser extent (approximately 2-fold and 
4-fold, respectivel y). Despite these increase s in s ystemic exposure with cyclosporine, plasma 
fidaxomicin concentrations remained low (< 27 ng/mL) and the drug was safe and well 
tolerated. Therefore, the increases in fidaxomicin concentrations that may  occur during 
concomitant treatment with cy clospo rine are unlikely  to be clinically  meaningful as s ystemic 
exposure is not relevant to the safety or efficacy of fidaxomicin which is used for CDAD, 
infections that are confined to the gastrointestinal (GI) tract.
In stud y OPT -80-008, subjects received a single oral dose of 0.5 mg digoxin tablets on Day s
1 and 13. All subjects also received oral fidaxomicin tablets (200 mg, q12h) on Days 8 to 18.  
When digoxin was administered 1 hour after a dose of 200 mg fidaxomicin, the L S mean 
Cmaxand AUC 0-∞values for digoxin were increased by  approximately  14% and 12%, 
respectivel y, on Day  13 as compared to Day  1. Other pharmacokinetic parameters were 
generall y similar between Days 1 and 13. These data suggested that 200 mg fidaxomicin 
q12h had little or no effect on the pharmacokinetics of digoxin.
When a probe cocktail of R -and S -warfarin, omeprazole, and midazolam was administered 
as a single dose with steady -state 200 mg fidaxomicin (Study  OPT -80-009), no statistically  
significant drug -drug interactions (DDI) were observed between fidaxomicin and warfarin 
isomers, omeprazole and its metabolite 5- hydroxyomeprazole, or with midazolam.
Following coadministration of rosuvastatin with fidaxomicin (Study  2819- CL-2003), a 
substrate for transporters BCRP, MRP2, and OATP2B1, with fidaxomicin (200 mg twice 
daily ) in healthy  volunteers, the rosuvastatin C max increased b y 17% and AUC 0-∞ by 9.7%. 
This effect of fidaxomicin on rosuvastatin exposure is not considered clinically  relevant and 
no dose adjustment is necessary .
1.2.2.2 Phase 2A Study
In the phase 2A study , fidaxomicin administered to subjec ts with CDAD twice dail y for 
10days at total daily  doses of 100, 200 and 400 mg showed dose -dependent relief of CDAD 
symptoms by  the end of therapy . Almost 90% of subjects receiving 400 mg/da y (200 mg q12h) 
showed total relief of symptoms at the end of treatment. There were no treatment-emergent 
adverse events (TEAE) that were considered to be drug-related. An analysis of time -to-
resolution of diarrhea provided additional evidence that higher doses were mor e efficacious 
than lower doses.
At the dose of 200 mg q12h (400 mg/day ), observable plasma fidaxomicin concentrations 
from Day  1 and Day  10 ranged from 5.32 to 84.9 ng/mL, while stool concentrations averaged 
over 1,400 μg/g. At the same dose, stool concentrations of fidaxomicin were approx imately

Version 3.0Incorporating Substantial Amendment s 1 & 22-3 fold higher than OP -1118, the active metabolite, but plasma levels of OP- 1118 remained 
well below the μg/mL range (maximum value 402 ng/mL).
Microbiological evaluation of the stool samples from th is study  alongside stools from 
vancom ycin-treated subjects showed that by  comparison with vancom ycin treated subjects, 
subjects treated with fidaxomicin had: (i) undiminished fecal titers of Bacteroides fragilis and 
other major ph ylogenetic groups; (ii) lo wer post -treatment C. difficile spore counts; (iii) less 
frequent post -therapy  expression of toxin.
1.2.2.3 Phase 3 Studies
Two randomized, double-blind, parallel group, multicenter phase 3 studies Studies 101.1.C.003 
and 101.1.C.004) were conducted to compare th e safet y and efficacy of 400 mg/day 
fidaxomicin (taken orally as 200 mg tablet q12h) with 500 mg/day  vancomycin capsule (taken 
orally  as 125 mg q6h) for 10 day s in subjects with CDAD. Comparing fidaxomicin to 
vancom ycin, clinical response rates at the EOT were similar ( Study  101.1.C.003 : 92.2% versu s 
89.6%; Study  101.1.C.004: 91.7% versu s 90.6%, fidaxomicin versu s vancomy cin, per protocol 
population). Fidaxomicin was superior to vancomy cin for sustained clinical response at 30 
days follow -up ( Study  101.1.C. 003: 74.4% versu s 64.2%, p=0.007; Study  101.1.C.004 : 76.7% 
versus 63.3%, p=0.001, Full Anal ysis Set (FAS) population). Recurrence rates were 
significantl y lower with fidaxomicin compared to vancom ycin ( Study 101.1.C.003 : 15.7% 
versus 25.1%, p=0.008; Study  101.1.C.004: 12.6% v ersus 27.0%, p<0.001, FAS population). 
In pooled results, fidaxomicin was well-tolerated with a safet y profile similar to that of 
vancom ycin. Only 5.9% of subjects treated with fidaxomicin withdrew from trials due to 
AEs. The primary  cause leading to discontinuation was vomiting, occurring at an incidence 
of 0.5% in both fidaxomicin and vancom ycin treatment groups.
1.2.2.4 Phase 2A Pediatric Study
A single arm phase 2A study  (OPT -80-206) in subjects with CDAD aged 6 months to 17 
years and 11 months to assess the safet y, tolerability  and pharmacokinetics of fidaxomicin 
tablets and suspension was conducted . Subjects below 6 y ears of age received weight -based 
doses of fidaxomicin oral suspension (32 mg/kg/day  with a maximum dose of 400 mg/day , 
divided into two doses) every  12 hours for 10 days. Subjects 6 y ears–17 years 11 months 
received 200 mg fidaxomicin tablets every  12 hours for 10 day s.
Clinical response rates were high overall, with 92.1% of subjects experiencing a clinical cure. 
Recurrence rates were 28.6% overall, and higher than observed in prior adult studies. T his is 
likely  reflective of high number of pediatric patients enrolling with prior episodes of CDAD , 
which is a strong risk factor for further recurrence [McFarland, 1999] . 
This study  was conducted in children with underly ing CDAD, and frequently  severe 
underly ing diseases such as neoplasms (24%). Overall, the safet y observations were consistent 
with both the underly ing conditions of the subjects and with data from prior studies in the adult 
CDAD population, and suggest that fidaxomicin is well tolerated in this population.

Version 3.0Incorporating Substantial Amendment s 1 & 2Fecal concentrations were in excess of the MIC 90of the organism in all age groups. There 
was a trend toward higher fecal concentrations of fidaxomicin in the lowest age group.
Higher fecal concentrations in the lowest age group or in individuals in other age groups are 
not related to AEs.
As observed previously in adults, plasma concentrations were generally  in the low ng/mL 
range, with a mean fidaxomicin concentration across the age strata that ranged from 9.8 
ng/mL to 15.2 ng/mL, at 3 -5 hours post -dose. As in adults, metabolite concentrations in the 
plasma wer e typicall y higher than parent concentrations, though still in the ng/mL range, 
with mean values from 28.5 ng/mL to 122 ng/mL across the age strata. There appeared to be 
no age -related trends in sy stemic exposures.
The observed plasma levels were not found to be above the levels observed in the main 
juvenile dog oral toxicity  study  (2819- TX-0004).
For further stud y results details reference is made to the I nvestigator’s Brochure addendum 1 
version 9.3.
1.3 Summary of Key Safety Information for Study Drugs
1.3.1 Fidax omicin
The safet y of fidaxomicin has been evaluated in 8phase 1 studies in healthy  adult subjects, one
phase 2A dose -finding study  conducted in adults with CDAD, 2 phase 3 studies conducted in 
adults with CDAD in which oral vancom ycin was a comparator and one recent phase 2A 
pediatric stud y. In addition, there is post-marketing pharmacovigilance data. The full safet y 
information of fidaxomicin is described in the Investigator’s Brochure (IB) version 9.3. 
1.3.2 Vancomycin
The safet y profile of oral vancom ycin ha s been established through extensive post -marketing 
experience and clinical studies. For safet y information of vancomycin reference is made to 
the SmPC vancomy cin capsules.
1.4 Risk -Benefit Assessment
CDAD in adults is associated with significant mortality andmorbidity , particularly  in those 
infected with highly  virulent strains. Loo showed that deaths attributable to CDAD occurred 
in 6.9% of patients [Loo et al, 2005], while all cause mortality  in the fidaxomicin phase 3 
studies was 5.3% to 7.6% . In an observational study  the mortalit y in children with CDAD 
was3.8% [ Kim et al, 2008 ]. The risks of any treatment should therefore be assessed in the 
context of the seriousnes s of the underl ying condition. The currentl y recommended 
treatments ,metranidazole a nd vancomy cin,have limitations such as disruption of intestinal 
flora, cross resistance with other agents and a high rate of recurrence. Fidaxomicin has low 
systemic absorption and a narrow spectrum of antimicrobial activity  and therefore represents 
a pot entially  useful treatment forCDAD in children .

Version 3.0Incorporating Substantial Amendment s 1 & 2Non-clinical safet y pharmacology, repeat dose toxicity , genotoxicity  and reproductive 
toxicity  studies of fidaxomicin did not identify  any hazard for humans.
Although s ystemic bioavailability  is low in humans (Cmax9.88 ng/mL after a 200 mg dose), 
the elderl y and those with CDAD appear to have higher exposure, as do patients with hepatic 
impairment.
Common AEs observed in the adult phase 3 studies were nausea, vomiting, and constipation. 
Uncommon AEs were rash, pruritis, decreased appetite, dizziness, headache, dysgeusia, 
abdominal distension, flatulence, dry  mouth and alanine aminotransferase increased (SmPC 
Dificlir). Acute h ypersensitivity  reactions have been reported during post marketing such as 
rash, pruritis, angioedema and d yspnea. [reference IB version 9.3 ]. 
In the phase 2 and 3 studies in adults , the deaths were mainl y due to respiratory disorders, 
sepsis and malignancy , and all were considered unrelated or unlikel y to be related to 
fidaxomicin or vancomycin.   
Given the limited experience with fidaxomicin to date, lack of efficacy  should also be 
considered a possibility . However, t he results of phase 3 studies in adults showed that one of 
the standard treatments for CDAD, vancom ycin,was comparable in terms of clinical 
response and safet y and may  be associated with higher rates of recurrence compared with 
fidaxomicin treatment.
The results of the phase 2A pediatric stud y (age: > 6 months - <18 years: see section 1.2) 
showed a safet y profile consistent with that seen in adults, with gastrointestinal disorders and 
infections/infestations the commonest AEs.  Six subjects developed AEs considered related 
to study  drug none of which were serious. These were tachy cardia, constipation, diarrhea, 
nausea, vomiting, increased body  temperature, urticaria, and elevated liver enzy mes. There 
were no safety signals detected b y analysis of vital signs, ECG or laboratory  data.  
Fidaxomicin has not been used in children < 6 months. A 4-week oral repeated- dose toxicity  
study  in juvenile beagle dogs showed no target organ for toxicity  after 28 day s of dosing up 
to 200 mg/kg/day  fidaxomicin fr om P ost Natal D ay 4(see section 1.2.1 ), which is the age 
equivalent to a newborn child.
Fidaxomicin is the first representative in the novel antib acterial class of macrocy cles. The 
current safet y data -base consists of a total of 798patients with mild to moderatel y severe 
CDI treated up to 10 days. Based on post -marketing experience since July  2011, the safet y 
profile of fidaxomicin has slightly  changed relative to that seen in the Phase III studies. Some 
patients with hy persensitivity  reactions reported a history  of allergy  to macrolides. 
Fidaxomicin should be used with caution in patients with a known macrolides allergy (SmPC 
Dificlir). The availab le data suggest that fidaxomicin will have an acceptable benefit-risk 
balance in the treatment of CDAD in children.

Version 3.0Incorporating Substantial Amendment s 1 & 22 STUDY OBJECTIVE(S), DESIGN, AND ENDPOINT S
2.1 Study Objectives
2.1.1 Primary
The primary  objective of this study  is to investigate the clinical response tofidaxomicin oral 
suspension or tablets and vancom ycin oral liquid or capsules of pediatric sub jects with 
Clostridium difficile -associated diarrhea (CDAD) from birth 
to <18 yearsof age.
2.1.2 Secondary
The secondary  objectives of this study  are to investigate the recurrence/sustained clinical 
response to and safet y of fidaxomicin and vancomycin in pediatric sub jects with Clostridium 
difficile -associated diarrhea (CDAD) from birth to <18 yearsof age, as well as palatability  
(acceptance) of the fid axomicin oral suspension formulation. 
2.2 Study Design and Dose Rationale
2.2.1 Study Design
This is a multicenter , investigator -blind , randomized parallel group study  to investigate the 
safet yand efficacy of a 10 -day course of fidaxomicin oral suspension or table ts anda 10-day 
course of vancom ycin oral liquid or capsules in subjects from birth to < 18 yearsof age with 
confirmed CDAD. Note that in the United States of America subjects can only  be included if 
aged ≥ 6 months to < 18 years.
In order to reduce diff erential assessment of safet y and efficacy outcome s,typically  a double -
blind study  would be preferred. However, due to nature of the active treatment and the 
comparator (e.g. formulation differences, dosing regimen differences) , double blinding of the 
study  drug for this pediatric study  population is not feasible, given dosing constraints. 
Therefore the study  will be investigator -blinded only .
The study will be conducted in North America and Europe across ~ 65to 80sites. A target of 
onehundred forty four subjects, stratified b y age at enrollment ( from birth to < 24 months, 
≥ 2 y ears to < 6 years, ≥ 6 y ears to < 12 years, and ≥ 12 y ears to < 18 years) will be enrolled. 
A minimum of 24 subjects will be enrolled into each age group . 
Subjects will be randomized to either fidaxomicin or vancom ycin arm in a 2:1 ratio, stratified 
by age group.
CDAD status will be assessed b y interviews with the subject/parent/legal guardian (or hospital 
staff e.g. when hospitalized). These interviews will be conducted in the morning, dail y during 
the treatment period through the End of Treatment and at EOT+2; thereafter weekl y at 9, 16 
and 23 day s after the EOT, and at End of Study  (EOS) EOT + 30 day s, following a 
standardized questionnaire. These interviews may be conducted b y telephone (e.g. when not 
hospitalized). During the interviews a standardized questionnaire will be used to collect the 
following information, number, date and time of the last episode of watery  diarrhea or 
unformed bowel movements since the last contact and if the subject has been hospitalized. The

Version 3.0Incorporating Substantial Amendment s 1 & 2subjects/parent/ legal guardian/hospital staff will receive a leaflet with instructions what 
information is to note.
Subject s who discontinue study  drug prematurel y should complete the EOT visit as soon as 
possible after the final dose. 
At EOT, the initial clinical response will be assessed. All subjects will continue in the 
Follow -up period. Subjects that have no initial clinical response will only  be contacted at 
EOSfor safety (adverse events) .
Two day s after EOT, a telephone contact with the subject/parent/legal guardian or a visit (if 
the subject is still in the hospital) will take place for all subjects with an initial clinical 
response at EOT to confirm the clinical response . All subjects will continue in the 30- day 
Follow -up period. Subjects without a confirmed clinical response will only  be contacted at 
EOSfor safety (adverse events).
At 9, 16and 23 day s after EOT, for subjects who had confirmed clinical response; the 
subject /parent/legal guardian will be contacted b y phone. 
For subjects with a recurrence of diarrhea during the Follow -up period, an Unscheduled visit as 
soon as possible is mandatory , includin g a stool sample. The stool sample will be split in two 
aliquots one for detection of toxigenic C.difficile at site and one for the reference lab (for 
possible microbiological and biochemistry  testing), for reassessment of CDAD (as per protocol 
criteria). Subjects with recurrence of CDAD will after the Unscheduled visit, continue in the 
Follow -up period and will only  be contacted at EO S for safet y (adverse events).
Thirty days after EOT, the EOS TC/ visit will take place. For subjects that had a confirmed 
clinical response at EOT +2 day s and did not experience a recurrence during the Follow-up 
period, all assessments will be done, including sustained clinical response assessment. For all 
other subjects a telephone call (TC) will be done for recording of safe ty information (adverse 
events).
Unscheduled visits could take place throughout the study  period, if deemed necessary  by the 
investigator. Onl y those assessments that are relevant according to the investigators opinion 
should be performed. However, evaluation of adverse events (AE) and concomitant 
medication is mandatory . (For subjects with a recurrence of diarrhea during the Follow -up 
period, a stool sample for reassessment of CDAD, see above. )
For subjects receiving fidaxomicin, plasma and stool samples w ill be anal yzed fidaxomicin 
and its main metabolite OP-1118 concentrations. P alatability  will be assessed for all subjects 
receiving fidaxomicin oral suspension or vancomy cin oral liquid.
A Data and Safet y Monitoring Board (DSMB) will be established for this study .

Version 3.0Incorporating Substantial Amendment s 1 & 22.2.2 Dose Rationale
Subjects aged ≥ 6 years to < 18 years will be randomized to receive either 400 mg dail y dose 
of fidaxomicin or 500 mg dail y dose of vancom ycin and subjects from birth to <6yearsof 
agewill be randomized to receive weight based doses of either fidaxomicin oral suspension 
or vancom ycin oral liquid.
Vancom ycin will be given at a dose of 40 mg/kg/day up to a maximum of 500 mg/day, either 
as an oral liquid (Vancomy cin Hospira powder for or al solution and for solution for infusion, 
Hospira SpA, Italian SmPC) , or oral capsules. This dose of vancom ycin is considered 
standard for children ( SmPC v ancomy cin capsules) .Please refer to section 5.1.1 T able 3B 
weight based dosing instruction of the vancom ycin oral liquid.
The standard total dail y dose of vancom ycin in adults is 500 mg/day , while that for 
fidaxomicin is 20% lower at 400 mg/day . Neither drug unde rgoes appreciable sy stemic 
absorption when administered orally , both are considered effective and have an acceptable 
risk/benefit balance.
The total daily  dose of fidaxomicin for children in the current study  was therefore chosen to 
be 20% lower than the standard dose of vancomycin as follows:
Fidaxomicin will be given at a dose of 32 mg/kg/day  up to a maximum of 400 mg/day , either 
as an oral suspension, or oral tablets. Please refer to section 5.1.1 T able 3A weight based 
dosing instruction of the fidaxomicin oral suspension . 
Both treatments will be given for 10 day s, a duration demonstrated to result in an acceptable 
cure rate of 85.7% to 88.2% inthe adult phase 3 studies.
The results of the Phase 2A pediatric stud y (OPT -80-206) suggest a pharmacokinetic profile 
that is generall y similar to that observed in adults, with low ng/mL  concentrations of 
fidaxomicin and its metabolite observed in the plasma, while concentrations in the feces are 
in the μg/g range, well above the MIC90 of the target organism. Overall, the safet y 
observations were consistent with both the underlying conditions of the subjects and with 
data from prior studies in the adult CDAD population, and suggest that fidaxomicin is well 
tolerated in this population. The pharmacokinetic, safet y, and efficacy results observed in this 
study  support the continuation of pediatric development of fidaxomicin with the same dose.

Version 3.0Incorporating Substantial Amendment s 1 & 2Definitions
Clinical response for subjects aged from birth to < 2 years is defined as: 
Absence of watery diarrhea for 2 consecutive day s during treatment and subjects remain well 
until the time of study  drug discontinuation (initial clinical response). In addition, subjects 
should not require further CDAD therap y within 2 days after completi on of study  drug 
(confirmed clinical response). Resolution of diarrhea is assessed during interviews of the 
subject/parent/ legal guardian supplemented by  a review of the subject’s personal records for 
the day  (if hospitalized), and the presence of watery  diarrhea.
Clinical response for subjects aged ≥ 2 years to < 18 years is defined as:   Improvement in 
the number and character of bowel movements as determined b y < 3 unformed bowel 
movements (UBMs) per day  
for 2 consecutive days during treatment and subjec ts remain 
well until the time of study  drug discontinuation (initial clinical response). In addition, 
subjects should not require further CDAD therap y 2days after completion of study  drug 
(confirmed clinical response). Resolution of diarrhea is assessed d uring interviews of the 
subject/parent/legal guardian, supplemented b y a review of the subject’s personal records for 
the day  (if hospitalized), and the number of UBMs.

Version 3.0Incorporating Substantial Amendment s 1 & 2A qualified person of APEB or Sponsor’s designee will perform the final release of the 
medication according to Directive 2003/94/EC annex 13.
4.3 Study Drug Handling 
Current ICH GCP Guidelines require the investigator to ensure that stud y drug deliveries 
from the Sponsor are received by  the investigator/or designee and
that such deliveries are recorded,
that study  drug is handled and stored accordin g to labeled storage conditions,
that study  drug with appropriate expiry /retest and is only dispensed to study  subjects in 
accordance with the protocol , and
that any  unused study  drug is returned to the Sponsor .
As this is an investigator blind study , site and Sponsor staff involved in dispensing , 
administering or collecting the study  drug will be unblinded . 
Drug inventory  and accountability  records for the study  drugs will be kept by  the 
investigator/ or designee. Study  drug accountability  throughout the study  must be documented 
and reconciled. The following guidelines are therefore pertinent:
The investigator agrees not to supply  study  drugs to any  persons except the eligible 
subjects in this study  in accordance with the protocol.
The investigator or designee will keep the stud y drugs in a pharmacy  or other locked and 
secure storage facility  under controlled storage conditions, accessible only  to those 
authorized by  the investigator to dispense these test drugs.
A study  drug inventory  will be maintained by  the investigator or designee. The inventory  
will include details of material received and a clear record of when they  were dispensed 
and to which subject.
At the conclusion or termination of this study , the investigator or designee agrees to 
conduct a final drug supply  inventory  and to record the results of this inventory  on the 
Drug Accountabil ity Record. I t must be possible to reconcile delivery  records with those 
of used and/or returned medication. An y discrepancies must be accounted for and 
documented. Appropriate forms of deliveries and returns must be signed b y the site staff 
delegated this responsibility .
The site must return study drug to the Sponsor or designee at the end of the study  or 
upon expiration.
4.4 Blinding
This is a n investigator -blind study . Subjects will be randomized to receive fidaxomicin or 
vancom ycin i n an investigator -blind fashion such that the investigator, Sponsor’s or 
designee’s study  management team, and clinical staff will not know which agent is being 
administered . However, site and S ponsor or designee staff involved in dispensing , 
administering or collecting the study  products and drug concentration blood sampling will be 
unblinded ,as well as subjects and the parents/legal guardians . In case of questions, subjects 
and parents/legal guardians can discuss with the unblinded staff. Subjects , parents/legal

Version 3.0Incorporating Substantial Amendment s 1 & 2guardians and unblinded staff will be instructed not to discuss the treatment (appearance, 
frequency  of dosing ,times of individual doses, palatability etc) and drug concentration blood 
sampling with the blinded staff. Blinded staff will be instructed not to discuss the study  
treatment with unblinded staff, subjects and parents/legal guardians.
Given the complexity  of maintaining the blind because of the charactaristics of the study  
medication and the pediatric population, accidental unblinding is a risk. Every  effort will be 
taken to maintain the blind. In the event of accidental unblinding of blinded site, CRO or 
sponsor staff, this will be documented. Accidental unblinding is not a reason to discontinue 
study  drug, even if the unblinding occurs b efore the start of treatment. Subjects should not be 
re-randomized for any  reason, even if accidental unblinding occurs. Further details will be 
described in the blinding instructions.
4.4.1 Unblinding for Subject Safety R easons
Unblinding of the stud y drug should onl y be considered for subject safet y or when critical 
therapeutic decisions are contingent upon knowing the blinded study  drug assignment. Any  
unblinding by  the investigational staff must be reported immediately  to the Sponsor and must 
include an explanation of why  the treatment allocation was disclos ed. If possible, the Sponsor
should be contacted prior to unblinding of the study drug.
4.4.2 Blinding Method
The medication will be provided in a blinded outer carton to prevent accidental unblinding by  
theinvestigator. The content of the provided medication will be unblinded hence medication 
will only  be prepared and handled by  unblinded care givers and site staff.
4.4.3 Retention of the Assignment Schedule and Procedures for Treatment Code
Breaking
The randomization list and study  drug blind will be maintained b y the Interactive Response 
Technology  (IRT) s ystem.
The DSMB will be provided access to the treatment assignment for periodic review of the 
data as documented in the DSMB Charter.
4.4.4 Breaking the Tre atment Code for Emergency
The treatment code for each randomized subject will be provided by  the IRT in the event of a
medical emergency  requiring knowledge of the treatment assigned to the subject. The time,
date, subject number and reason for obtaining a ny of these codes, and therefore breaking the
blind, must be documented in the study  file. They must only  be requested by  the investigator 
or other persons designated as sub-investigators. 
4.4.5 Breaking the Treatment Code by the Sponsor
The S ponsor may  break the treatment code for subjects who experience a Suspected 
Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction (SUSAR), in order to determine if the individual case 
or a group of cases requires expedited regulatory  reporting . Individual Emergency  Code swill

reporting purposes.
4.5 Assignment and Allocation
Randomization will be performed via IRT. Prior to the first study  drug administration , the 
unblinded site staff will contact the IRT system in order to determine the randomly  assigned 
treatment. Specific procedures for randomization through the IRT are contained in the Study 
Procedures Manual.
5 TREATMENTS AND EVALU ATION

Version 3.0Incorporating Substantial Amendment s 1 & 2For subject saged ≥ 6years to < 18 years prior to randomization the ability  for the subject to 
swallow tablets or capsules needs to be determined. If a subject aged ≥ 6 years to < 18 years 
cannot swallow tablets or capsules, fidaxomicin oral suspension orvancomy cin oral liquid
can be given as per the subject’s treatment allocation. During the tr eatment period, a change 
of formulation for a subject is not allowed.
Subjects and parents/legal guardians/unblinded study  staff will be instructed not to discuss 
the treatment (appearance, frequency  of dosing, palatability , times of individual doses etc.) 
with the blinded study  staff.
5.1.2 Increase or Reduction in Dose of the Study Drug(s)
Increases and reductions of study  drug are not permitted because the aim of the study  is to 
investigate fixed weight based dose of fidaxomicin and vancom ycin.  
5.1.3 Previous and Concomitant Treatment (Medication and Non -Medication 
Therapy)
Previous medication (medication history ) taken within a month prior to screening will be 
entered in the Electronic Case Report Form (eCRF).  An y treatments of relevance to CDAD, 
either as t reatments for CDAD or causative agents such as antibiotics or anti -cancer therapies 
used within 3 months prior to screening should be recorded in the eCRF.   The most recent 
use of fidaxomicin or any  macrolide antibiotic should be recorded in the eCRF, rega rdless of 
how long ago it was taken.
Concomitant medication includes relevant therapies prescribed b y the study doctor, other 
doctors and over the counter drugs taken from Day 1 until the EOS ( EOT + 30 day s)and 
should be recorded in the eCRF .
Medication history  and concomitant treatment consists of drug and non- drug therapies, 
prescribed and over -the-counter (OTC) and all alternative medicines. This also includes 
drugs used on a chronic and as- needed basis. Subjects will be instructed not to start any  new
medication during the screening period through EOS , both prescribed and OTC , without prior 
consultation of the investigator wherever possible.
5.1.3.1 Prohibited Medication and Restricted Medication
No other antibacterial agents potentially  useful in the treatment of CDAD (e.g., 
metronidazole , oral vancomy cin,oral bacitracin, fusidic acid, rifaximin, nitazoxanide) or 
fecal transplantation should be given during the study unless they  are specifically  given 
because of a primary  treatment failure or suspected CDAD recurrence after initial clinical 
response. 
It is preferred that prior to randomization, no pretreatment for CDAD is given . However, if 
the investigator feels there is a clinical imperative to begin treatment before knowi ng the 
laboratory  result of direct or indirect testing for presence of toxigenic C.difficile , up to four 
doses but no more than 24 hours of treatment with metronidazole , oral vancomycin or any  
other effective treatment for CDAD are allowed.

Version 3.0Incorporating Substantial Amendment s 1 & 2Drugs to control diarrhea (e.g., loperamide) should also be withheld during the study  period. 
Whenever possible, drugs which could affect peristalsis should be avoided. Subjects 
receiving opi oids for pain prior to enrollment may  continue to receive the same opi oidand 
dose during the treatment phase if required . 
See Appendix 12.1 Excluded Concomitant Medications for additional details on prohibited 
medications and medicatio ns permitted with restrictions .
Co-administration of potent P- glycoprotein inhibitors such as cyclosporine, ketoconazole, 
erythromy cin, clarithromy cin, verapamil, dronedarone and amiodarone is not recommended, 
but these medications are not prohibited.
5.1.4 Treatment Compliance
Study  subjects and/or legal guardian (as applicable) should be counseled on the need to meet 
100% treatment compliance. The unblinded i nvestigator or designee should ensure that 
subjects meet this goal. The quantity  of study  drug dispense d will be counted or measured 
and recorded in the eCRF at EOT . 
Treatment compliance will be based on the weight of the oral liquid/oral suspension used or 
count of tablets/capsules used during the treatment period (whatever applies), which will be 
recorded in the eCRF. Subjects will be regarded as compliant if the calculated amount of 
oral liquid/oral suspension used or of tablets/capsules used (as applicable) is between 80%
and 120% 
(inclusive) of th eexpected amount forthe number of day s on trea tment . 
Site and Sponsor staff involved in dispensing , administering or collecting the study  drug will 
be unblinded . 
The study  drug will not be dispensed to an y persons not enrolled in the study .
5.2 Demographics and Baseline Characteristics
5.2.1 Demographics
The subject’s age, gender, race and ethnicit y (if permitted), height and weight will be 
recorded at screening visit.
5.2.2 Medical History
Medical history  (other than for CDAD ) for each subject will be obtained at Screening .
Relevant past and present conditions, as well as prior surgical procedures will be recorded in 
the eCRF.
5.2.3 Diagnosis of the Target Disease, Severity, and Duration of Disease 
A detailed diarrhea history  for each subject will be obtained during Screening. This includes 
start and stop date, antibioti c treatment, andall CDAD episodes that occurred in the last three 
months prior to screening. Additionall y start date and signs and s ymptoms of the current 
CDAD episode will be collected, including number of UBMs/presence of watery  diarrhea 
within 24 hours prior to enrollment. The following risk factors will be collected in the eCRF: 
Antibiotics/ Cancer / Other, if applicable.

Version 3.0Incorporating Substantial Amendment s 1 & 25.2.4 Rotavirus
For subjects < 5 years only , a rotavirus test is required at Screening. A pre- consent standard 
of care result (historical s ample) may  be used, provided the sample was taken after the onset 
of diarrhea and within 3 day s prior to randomization.
5.3 Efficacy Assessment
The following efficacy  variables will be assessed:
Confirmed clinical response based on the assessment by  the investigator (at EOT+2 day s).
Sustained clinical response at the End of Study  (EOT +30 day s).
Sustained clinical response 14 day s after Confirmation Clinical Response (EOT +16 day s).
Time to resolution of diarrhea (TTROD) .
Recurrence of CDAD during or at theend of the Follow -up period.
Time to recurrence of CDAD during or at the end of the Follow
-up period.
Definitions are described in sections 2.3.1 and 2.3.2
During the treatment period (until EOT) the subject/parent/legal guardian (or hospital staff e.g. 
when hospitalized) will be contacted daily  in the morning for interviews. These interviews will 
also take place at EOT+2; thereafter weekl y at 9, 16 and 23 days after the EOT, and at End of 
Study  (EOS) EOT + 30 day s.These interviews may  be conducted by  telephone (e.g. when not 
hospitalized) . During the interviews a standardized questionnaire will be used to collect the 
following information, number, date and time of the last episode of watery  diarrhea or unformed 
bowel movements since the last contact and if the subject has been hospitalized. The 
subjects/parent/legal guardian/hospital staff will receive a leaflet with instructions what 
information is to note.
Resolution of diarrhea is to be assessed b y the investigator based on these interviews, 
supplemented by  review of t he subject’s personal records for the day  (if subject is 
hospitalized), and the number of UBMs/presence of watery  diarrhea (as applicable).
The assessment of initial clinical response will take place at EOT; 2 day s thereafter the 
assessment of confirmed cl inical response will be done.
Sustained clinical response and recurrence will only  be assessed in subjects having confirmed 
clinical response at EOT +2 day s. For this, t he subject/parent/legal guardian will be contacted 
weekl y after EOT (at EOT + 9, +16 an d +23 day s) until recurrence or the EOS TC/visit (EOT 
+ 30 day s), whichever comes first. (If an Unscheduled visit occurs, recurrence will be 
assessed). The subject/parent/legal guardian will be instructed to note the date in the event of 
recurrence. The as sessment of recurrence will be done by  the investigator .

5.4.3 Laboratory Assessments
Routine safety  laboratory assessments will be performed at the Screening and End of 
Treatment vis itby the local laboratory  and recorded in the eCRF. Additional laboratory  
testing may  be carried out by  the 
investigator if deemed necessary .
In Table 4the laborator y tests that will be performed during the conduct of the study  are 
listed. See the Schedule of Assessments for stud y visit collection dates. It is not required that 
the subjects are fasting prior to blood sampling for these assessments. Please refer to 
Appendix 12.2 for additional Drug Induced Liver Injury  (DILI )laboratory  testing 
requirements and timing.
For the hematology , biochemistry  and urinalysis at Screening, results that were obtained as 
part of standard of care before consent (“historical sample”) are acceptable, provided that the 
sampling was done 
after the onset of CDAD and within 3 day s prior to randomization. For 
the hematology , biochemistry  and urinaly sis at EOT visit, results that were obtained as part 
of standard of care between D ay 8 and Day10 (inclusive) (“standard of care sample”) are 
acceptable. The most recent results should be used for eCRF completion. If such results are 
not available, samples should be taken for the purpose of the study .The historical or standard 
of care sample may  not include all parameters as described in Table 4  A historical/standard 
of care samples without parameter(s) indicated with * in the table is acceptable.

Version 3.0Incorporating Substantial Amendment s 1 & 25.4.4 Physical Examination
The subject’s ph ysical state will be examined and recorded at Screening, En d of Treatment
and if deemed necessary  by the investigator at an Unscheduled visit . This includes 
examination of main body  systems. The date of the phy sical examination only  will be 
recorded in the eCRF. Any clinical lyrelevant adverse change will be recor ded as an AEin 
the eCRF (see section 5.5.1 ).
5.4.5 Electrocardiogram (ECG)
Two 12 lead ECGs will be performed : one at S creening prior to the first dose of study  drug 
and another 1 to 5hours post -dose (the morning or evening dose for the fidaxomicin arm, or 
the first or the third dose of the day  for the vancomy cin arm) on an y day  between Days 5 and 
10 inclusive, but not wi thin 30 minutes after ven ipuncture. 
For the ECG at Screening, an ECG that is performed as a part of standard of care before 
consent is acceptable, provided that it was recorded after the onset of CDAD and within 
3days prior to randomization.
Wherever pos sible , ECGs will be taken with the subject in the supine position, after the 
subject has been l ying quietly  for 5 minutes. 
ECGs will be recorded at a speed of 25 mm/sec and all leads have to include at least 
4complexes. The original ECG traces will inclu de the subject number, date and visit number 
and must be kept with the source documents. If the ECG traces are printed on thermal paper, 
a photocop y must be made and kept with the source documents.
Original ECGs will be collected for central ECG reading and returned to site if requested.
Central ECG read data will be transferred electronically  to the sponsor.
Any clinically  significant adverse changes on the ECG will be reported as AEs in the eCRF 
(see section 5.5.1 ).
5.4.6 CDAD Signs and Symptoms
CDAD signs and s ymptoms (highest body temperature in the 3 day s prior to first dose, 
highest white blood cell in the 3 day s prior to first dose, abdominal discomfort, abdominal 
tenderness) will be recorded at Screening. Abdominal discomfort and abdominal tenderness 
will be recorded at End of Treatment. An y clinically  relevant adverse change will be 
recorded as an AE in the eCRF (see section 5.5.1 ).
5.5 Adverse Events and Other Safety Aspects

Version 3.0Incorporating Substantial Amendment s 1 & 25.5.1 Definition of Adverse Events (AEs)
An AE is defined as an y untoward medical occurrence in a subject administered a stud y drug 
or has undergone study  procedures and which does not necessaril y have a causal relationship 
with this treatment. An AEcan therefore be an y unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory  finding), s ymptom, or disease temporally  associated with the use of a medicinal 
(investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product. 
An abnormality  identified during a medical test (e.g., laboratory  parameter, vital sign, ECG 
data, ph ysical exam) should be defined as an AE only  if the abnormality meets one of the 
following criteria:
Induces clinical signs or sy mptoms.
Requires active intervention.
Requires interruption or discontinuation of study  drug.
The abnormalit yor investigational value is clinically  significant in the opinion of the 
investi gator.
All subjects will remain in the study  until EOS for safet y assessment. All AEs occurring 
between signing informed consent and EOS TC/visit should be recorded.
The s pecified AEs / findings of interest for this study are shown below and may require m ore 
extensive collection of information which will be collected in targeted questionnaires: 
Development of microbial resistance to fidaxomicin
Hypersensitivity  to fidaxomicin
GIhemorrhage
Decreases in WBC, neutrophil and ly mphocy te counts 
Hepatic laboratory  value abnormalities
Renal laboratory value abnormalities
QT-interval prolongation 
Lack of efficacy  / lack of effect / treatment failure
Some countries may  have additional local requirements for events that are required to be 
reported as AEs or in an expedited manner similar to an SAE. I n these cases, it is the 
investigator’s responsibility  to ensure these AEs or other reporting requirements are followed 
and the information is appropriatel y recorded in the (e)CRF accordingly.
In addition, if a nyof these events meet the criteria for a S erious Adverse E vent (SAE) , the 
SAE reporting requirements in section 5.5.5 will apply .
5.5.2 Definition of Serious Adverse Eve nts (SAEs)
An adverse event is considered “serious” if, in the view of either the investigator or Sponsor, 
it results in any  of the following outcomes:
Results in death
Is life threatening (an adverse event is considered “life -threatening” if, in the view of 
either the investigator or Sponsor, its occurrence places the subject at immediate risk of

Version 3.0Incorporating Substantial Amendment s 1 & 2death. It does not include an adverse event that, had it occurred in a more severe form, 
might have caused death)
Results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity or substantial disruption of the 
ability  to conduct normal life functions
Results in congenital anomaly, or birth defect
Requires inpatient hospitalization or leads to prolongation of hospitalization 
(hospitalization for treatment/observation/ examination caused b y AE is to be considered 
as serious) 
Other medicall y important events
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting 
is appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be 
immediately  life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may  jeopardize the 
subject or may  require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the 
definition above. These events, including those that may  result in disability /incapacit y, 
should also usually  be considered serious. Examples of such events are intensive treatment in 
an emergency  room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dy scrasias or convulsions 
that do not result in hospitalization; or developme nt of drug dependency  or drug abuse.
Special situation events relevant to the medicinal products administered to the subject as part 
of the study  (e.g., study  drug, comparator, background therapy ) that may  require expedited 
reporting and/or safet y evaluat ion include, but are not limited to:
Overdose of the medicinal product(s)
Suspected abuse/misuse of the medicinal product(s)
Inadvertent or accidental exposure to the medicinal product(s)
Medication error involving the medicinal product(s) (with or without subject/patient 
exposure to the Sponsor medicinal product, e.g., name confusion)
Drug -drug interaction
Lack of efficacy
All special situations listed above should be especially  monitored and reported on a SAE 
form, even if considered non -serious and regardless whether or not an (S)AE occurred. The 
above special situation will not be captured on the AE form in the eCRF, inst ead they  will be 
captured in the dosing and accountabilit y forms within the eCRF. 
As fidaxomicin is orally  administered, for this study , there is no risk of occupational 
exposure and risk of transmission of infectious agents is limited, therefore the Spon sor do not 
expect these events to be reported.
The Sponsor has a list of events that they  classify  as “alway s serious” events.  I f an adverse 
event is reported that is considered to be an event per thisclassification as “always serious”, 
additional inform ation on the event may  be requested.   
If a subject becomes pregnant during treatment, this should be reported as if it were an SAE.

Version 3.0Incorporating Substantial Amendment s 1 & 25.5.3 Criteria for Causal Relationship to the Study Drug
Adverse events that fall under either "Possible" or "Probable" should be defined as "adverse 
events whose relationship to the study  drugs could not be ruled out".
Causal relationsh ip
to the study drugCriteria for ca
usal relationship
Not Related A clinical event, including laboratory  test abnormality , with a 
temporal  relationship to drug administration which makes a causal 
relationship improbable, and /orin  which other drugs, chemicals or 
underly ing disease provide plausible explanations.
Possible A clinical event, including laboratory  test abnormality , with a 
reasonable time sequence to administration of the drug, but which 
could also be explained by c oncurrent disease or other drugs or 
chemicals. Information on drug withdrawal may  be lacking or 
unclear.
Probable A clinical event, including laboratory  test abnormality , with a 
reasonable time sequence to administration of the drug, unlikel y to 
be attrib uted to concurrent disease or  other drugs or chemicals, and 
which follows a clinically  reasonable response on re -
administration (rechallenge) or withdrawal (dechallenge).
5.5.4 Criteria for Defining the Severity of an Adverse Event
Thefollowing standard with 3 grades is to be used to measure the severit y of AEs, including 
abnormal clinical laboratory  values:
Mild: No disruption of normal daily  activities
Moderate:   Affect normal dail y activities
Severe: Inability  to perform dail y activities
5.5.5 Reporting of Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)
In the case of a serious adverse event (SAE), the investigator must contact the delegated CRO 
by telephone or fax immediatel y (within 24 hours of awareness).
The investigator should complete and submit an SAE Worksheet containing all information 
that is required b y the Regulatory Authorities to thedelegated CRO by fax immediately  
(within 24 hours of awareness). If the faxing of an SAE Worksheet is not possible or is not 
possible within 24 hours, the local drug safet y contact should be informed by  phone.

Sponsor’s Personnel). 
Follow -up information for the event should be sent promptly  (within 7 day s of the initial 
notification.
Full details of the SAE should be recorded on the medical records and on the eCRF. The 
investigator must ensure that information on the SAE Worksheet is reconciled with the 
information on the AE pages within the eCRF. 
The following minimum information is required:
ISN/Study  number   2819- CL-
0202,
Subject number, sex and age ,
The date of report ,
A description of the SAE (event, seriousness of the event) , and
Causal relationship to the study  drug .
The Sponsor or Sponsor's designee will submit expedited safet y reports (i.e. CI OMS, IND 
Safety
 Reports) to the regulatory  agencies (i.e. EMA, FDA) as necessary , and will inform the 
investigators of such regulatory  reports. Investigators must submit safety  reports as required 
by their local Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) within 
timelines set by  regional regulations (i.e. EU, (e)CTD, FDA). Documentation of the 
submission to and receipt by  the IRB/IEC of expedited safet y reports should be retained b y 
the site .
The delegated CRO will notify  all investigators responsible for ongoing clinical studies with 
the study  drug of all SAEs which require submission per local requirements to I RB/IEC.
The investigators should provide written documentation of I RB/IEC notif ication for each 
report to the S ponsor.
You may  contact the Sponsor's Medical Monitor/Expert for any  other problem related to the 
safet y, welfare, or rights of the subject .
For Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction s (SUSARs) from a blinded trial, 
unblinded CI OMS -I reports will be submitted to the authorities and central IRB/IEC where 
required .
5.5.6 Follow -up ofAdverse Events
All AEs occurring during or after the subject has discontinued the study  are to be followed up 
until resolved or judged to be no longer clinicall y significant, or until they  become chronic to 
the extent that they  can be fully  characterized. 
If during AE follow -up, the adverse event progresse sto an"SAE ", or if a subject experiences 
a new SAE , the investigator must immediately  report the information to the S ponsor .

5.5.7 Monitoring of Common Serious Adverse Events
For this protocol, there are no SAEs that are exempted from expedited safety  reporting .
5.5.8 Proce dure in Case of Pregnancy
If a female subject or partner of a male subject becomes pregnant during the treatment period 
or Follow -up period, the investigator should report the information to the delegated CRO as 
if it isanSAE . The expected date of delivery  or expected date of the end of the pregnancy , 
last menstruation, estimated conception date, pregnancy  result and neonatal data etc., should 
be included in this information.
The investigator will follow the medical status of the mother, as well as the fetus, as if the 
pregnancy  is an SAE and will report the outcome to the Sponsor.
When the outcome of the pregnancy  falls under the criteria for SAE s [spontaneous abortion, 
induced abortion, stillbirth, death of newborn, congenital anomal y (including anomaly  in a 
miscarried fetus)], the investigator should respond in accordance with the report procedure 
for SAE s. Additional information regarding the outcome of a pregnancy  (which is 
categorized as an SAE ) is mentioned below.
"Spontaneous abortion "include s miscarriage, abortion and missed abortion
Death of an infant within 1 month after birth should be reported as an SAE regardless of 
its relationship with the study  drug
If an infant dies more than 1 month after the birth, it should be reported if a relati onship 
between the death and intrauterine exposure to the study  drug is judged as "possible "by 
the investigator
In the case of a delivery  of a living newborn, the "
normality" of the infant is evaluated at 
the birth
Unless a congenital anomaly  is identifie d prior to spontaneous abortion or miscarriage, 
the embry o or fetus should be assessed for congenital defects b y visual examination.
If during the conduct of a clinical trial, a male subject makes his partner pregnant , the 
subject should report the pregnan cy to the investigator. The investigator will report the 
pregnancy  to the Sponsor/ delegated CRO as an SAE .
5.5.9 Emergency Procedures and Management of Overdose
Fidaxomicin: In the event of suspected overdose, the subject should receive supportive care 
andmonitoring. The Medical Monitor/Expert should be contacted as applicable.
Vancom ycin: In the event of suspected overdose, guidance in the local product labeling is to 
be followed at the investigator’s discretion. The Medical Monitor/Expert should be contac ted 
as applicable.

When new information becomes available necessary  for conducting the clinical study  
properl y, the Sponsor will inform all investigators involved in the clinical study  as well as the 
regulatory  authorities. Investigators should inform the I RB/IEC of such information when 
needed. 
5.6 Test Drug Concentration
Plasma and stool samples will be analy zed for fidaxomicin and its main metabolite OP-1118
concentrations. 
For subjects receiving fidaxomicin, two blood samples will be taken on an y day between 
Day 5 and 10 inclusive. Every  effort should be made to take these samples in conjunction 
with routine blood samples being taken for standard of care. However, one sample should be 
collected 
within 30 minutes pre -dose and another between 1 to 5 hours post -dose. The two 
samples do not have to be collected on the same day . 
Blood samples will be collected via an intravenous cannula or b y direct veni puncture. Whole 
blood will be collected at each sampling time point into an appropriatel y labeled blood 
collection tube. A 1mL blood tube containing EDTA as anticoagulant will be collected. 
Plasma will be prepared and stored in pre labeled poly propylene vials at nominal -70C, 
according to procedures specified in the laboratory  operations manual.
For all the subjects, one stool sample will be taken on any  day between Day 5 and 10 
inclusive, within 24 hours of a dose for drug concentration anal ysis. 
Stool samples will be collected in containers provide d by the central laboratory  according to 
the instructions provided in the laboratory  operations manual.
Information on the pre -printed sample tube labels should contain at a minimum:
Study  number 2819- CL-0202
Subject number
“Plasma ” or “feces” 
Unique s ample number
Protocol Day  and time
All samples for a subject will be stored and shipped as a package for that subject as organized b y 
the central laboratory
. Samples will be shipped under appropriate dry -ice conditions by  a courier 
to the central laborator y and anal yzed under responsibility  of Astellas Bioanaly sis-Europe
section of Astellas in Europe for subsequent determination of fidaxomicin and OP-1118 
concentrations. Bioanal ysis of fidaxomicin and OP -1118 in plasma and faeces will be performed 
using val idated liquid chromatography  with tandem mass spectrometry  (LC MS/MS) methods.
Further details will be specified in the laboratory  operations manual.
The actual date and time of each blood and stool sample collection will be recorded in the 
eCRF, as well a s if the stool sample is taken from the diaper.

Version 3.0Incorporating Substantial Amendment s 1 & 25.7 Other Measurements , Assessments or Methods
5.7.1 Stool Samples for Toxigenic C.difficile and Microbiological Testing
Stool samples will be obtained at Screening, at the End of Treatment visit and in case of 
recurre nce at the Unscheduled visit. Stool samples will be split into two aliquots; one for 
local (direct or indirect) testing for presence of toxigenic C.difficile at the study  site and one 
for microbiological testing at the reference laboratory. 
For assessment of inclusion criteria for Screening, a routinely  performed local rapid test that 
was taken after the onset of CDAD and within 72 hours prior to randomization is acceptable.
This sample may  be a pre -consent sample taken as standard of care.
In this situati on an
addition alstool sample (for possible microbiological and biochemistry  testing) for the
reference laboratory  need sto be taken as part of Screening, even if on antibiotic treatment. 
Microbiological testing will be performed on stool samples collected pre -treatment and post -
treatment and in case of recurrence. Results from relevant microbiological and biochemical 
assay s may  be used foran exploratory  evaluation of efficacy  or to furthe r increase knowledge 
on the investigational product.
Stool samples for microbiology testing at the reference laboratory  will be frozen at -70 C and 
stored at the site until sent batch -wise to a central laboratory  for further characterization. Stool 
samples will be anal yzed in order to confirm the presence of toxigenic C. difficile and where 
sufficient sample allows, also confirm the presence of toxin in the stool sample. C. difficile will 
be cultured from all confirmed positive samples and additional tests may be carried out on 
these isolates including, but not limited to PCR riboty ping and antimicrobial susceptibility  
profile evaluation. The samples will be stored for no longer than 5 years after the completion of 
the study . A decision on the exact anal ysesto be performed will be taken at a later stage and 
may be dependent on the results of the toxin tests or riboty ping. Assessments will be limited to 
any microbiological marker present in the stool sample or its derived culture.
Results from the central lab oratory  will not be returned to the investigator.
Details for processing and shipping the stool samples will be described in the laboratory  
manual, to be provided before the start of the study.
5.7.2 Palatabilit y Testing
Palatability  will be assessed for all subjects receiving fidaxomicin oral suspension and 
vancom ycin oral liquid (i.e. subjects from birth to ≤ 6 y earsof age and subjects > 6 y ears 
unable to swallow tablets) onDay 1 and on Day  7 (±1day) by means of a five point rating 
scale b y unblinded staff if hospitalized, and by the subject/parents/legal guardian when at 
home. 
Details will be provided in the palatability assessment instructions.
In case the drug product is rejected without act
ual oral administration the response cannot be 
rated. This will be recorded in the eCRF.

Version 3.0Incorporating Substantial Amendment s 1 & 25.8 Total Amount of Blood
The following blood volume limits for sampling are recommended (although are not evidence -
based). If an investigator decides to deviate from thes e, this should be justified. Per individual, 
the trial -related blood loss (including an y losses in the manoeuvre) should not exceed 3% of 
the total blood volume during a period of four weeks and should not exceed 1% at any  single 
time. I n the rare case of simultaneous trials, the recommendation of 3% remains the maximum. 
The total volume of blood is estimated at 80 to 90 mL /kg body  weight; 3% is 2.4 m Lblood per 
kg bod y weight. (Ethical Considerations for Clinical Trials on Medicinal Products Conducted 
with the Paediatric Po pulation, European Medicines Agency , 2008 ).
Examples of the total amount of blood collected per subject during the course of the study  are

permanentl y discontinued prematurel y for an y reason.  
The subject is free to withdraw from the study  treatment and/or study  for any  reason and at 
any time without giving reason for doing so and without penalty  or prejudice. The 
investigator is also free to terminate a subject 's involvement in the study  at any  time if the 
subject 's clinical condition warrants it.

Version 3.0Incorporating Substantial Amendment s 1 & 2If a subject is discontinued from the study  with an ongoing adverse event or an unresolved 
laboratory  result that is significantly  outside of the reference range, the inv estigator will 
attempt to provide follow- up until the condition stabilizes or no longer is clinically  
significant. 
Examples for Discontinuation Criteria for Individual Subjects:
Adverse event(s)
Lack of efficacy  
Subject lost to follow up
Protocol deviation
A clear and concise reason for discontinuation should be recorded in the eCRF. 
In case of discontinuation of study  drug before completion of the full 10 -day treatment 
course, the subject should complete the EOT visit as soon as possible after the last drug 
administration. I f at this visit, subject has an initial clinical response, the subject will continue 
in the Follow -up period for safet y and efficacy unless consent has been withdrawn. 
6.2 Discontinuation of the Site
If an investigator intends to discontinue participation in the study , the investigator must 
immediately  inform the Sponsor.
6.3 Discontinuation of the Study
The Sponsor may terminate this study  prematurely , either in its entirety  or at any  study  site, 
for reasonable cause provided that written notice is submitted in advance of the intended 
termination. Advance notice is not required if the study  is stopped due to safety  concerns. If 
the Sponsor terminates the study  for safet y reasons, the Sponsor will immediately  notify  the 
investigator and subsequently  provide written instructions for study  termination.
7 STATISTICAL METHODOL OGY
The statistical anal ysis will be coordinated by  the responsible biostatistician of Astellas. A 
Statistical Analy sis Plan (SAP) will be written to provide details of the statistical analy sis 
along with specifications for tables, listings and figures (TLFs) to be produced. The SAP will 
be finalized before the database soft lock at the latest . 
Prior to d
atabase lock, a Final D ata Review and TLFs Meeting will be held to allow a review 
of the clinical stud y data and to verify the data that will be used for anal ysis set classification. 
If required, consequences for the statistical anal ysis will be discussed. A meeting to

Version 3.0Incorporating Substantial Amendment s 1 & 2The following imputation of missing information for the assessment of clinical response and 
recurrence /sustained response is foreseen (taking into consideration applicable visit 
windows) :
Missing information for efficacy  variables of confirmed clinical response and sustained 
clinical response will be estimated using the multiply imputation procedure which will
replace each missing value with a set of plau sible values as predictions from logistic 
regression based on bowel mo vement data, and previous CDAD experience . Each
multiply  imputed data set will then be anal yzed and the methodology  combines the 
results from all datasets to give a single final analysis that takes into account the 
uncertaint y of the imputed values .
Sensi tivity  analy ses forefficacy  endpoints  will be described in the SAP . 
As a general principle, no imputation of other missing data will be done (e.g. labs, vital signs, 
ECGs, etc) . Exceptions are the start and stop dates of AEs and concomitant medication. The 
imputed dates will be used to allocate the concomitant medication and AEs to a study  period , 
in order to determining whether an AE is/is not treatment emergent. Listings of the AEs and 
concomitant medications will present the actual partial dates; impu ted dates will not be shown.
Visit windows for the assessments planned a fter the EOT are defined in the Schedule of 
Assessments.

8.1.6 Protocol Deviations
A protocol deviation is generall y an unplanned excursion from the protocol that is not 
implemented or intended as a s ystematic change. The investigator is responsible for ensuring 
the study  is conducted in accordance with the procedures and evaluations des cribed in this 
protocol and must protect the rights, safet y, and welfare of subjects. The investigator should 
not implement any  deviation from, or changes of, the protocol, unless it is necessary  to 
eliminate an immediate hazard to trial subjects.  
A protocol waiver is a documented prospective approval of a request from an investigator to 
deviate from the protocol. Protocol waivers are strictly  prohibited.
For the purposes of this protocol, deviations requiring notification to Sponsor are defined as 
any subject who: 
Entered into the study  even though they  did not satisfy  entry  criteria. 
Developed withdrawal criteria during the study  and not withdrawn
Received wrong treatment or incorrect dose. 
Received excluded concomitant treatment. 
When a deviation from the protocol is identified for an individual subject, the investigator or 
designee must ensure the Sponsor is notified. The Sponsor will follow -up with the 
investigator, as applicable, to assess the deviation and the possible impact to the safet y and / 
or efficacy  of the subject to determine subject continuation in the study . 
If a deviation impacts the safet y of a subject, the investigator must contact the Sponsor 
immediately .
The investigator will also assure that deviations meeting IRB/IEC and appl icable regulatory  
authorities’ criteria are documented and communicated appropriatel y. All documentation and 
communications to the IRB/IEC and applicable regulatory  authorities will be provided to the

Version 3.0Incorporating Substantial Amendment s 1 & 212.2 Liver Safety Monitoring and Assessment
Any subject enrolled in a clinical study  with active drug therapy  and reveals an increase of 
serum aminotransferases (AT) to > 3 × ULN, or bilirubin > 2 × ULN, should undergo detailed 
testing for liver enzy mes (including at least ALT, AST, AL P, and Total Bilirubin [TBL]). 
Testing should be repeated within 48 -72 hours of notification of the test results. Subjects 
should be asked if they  have an y symptoms suggestiv e of hepatobiliary  dysfunction.
Definition of Liver Abnormalities
Confirmed abnormalities will be characterized as moderate and severe where ULN:
ALT or AST Total Bilirubin
Moderate > 3× ULN Or > 2× ULN
Severe* > 3× ULN and > 2× ULN
In addition, the subject should be considered to have severe hepatic abnormalities for an y of 
the following:
●ALT or AST > 8× ULN
●ALT or AST > 5× ULN for more than 2 weeks  
●ALT or AST > 3× ULN and INR > 1.5 (If INR testing is applicable/evaluated).
●ALT or AST > 3× ULN with the appearance of fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper 
quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, rash and/or eosinophi lia (> 5%). 
The investigator may  determine that abnormal liver function results, other than as described 
above, may  qualify  asmoderate or severe abnormalities and require additional monitoring 
and follow -up.
Follow -up Procedures
Confirmed moderate and severe abnormalities in hepatic functions should be thoroughly  
characterized b y obtaining appropriate expert consultations, detailed pertinent history , phy sical 
examination and laboratory  tests. The site should complete the L iver Abnormality  Case Report 
Form (LA -CRF) that has been developed globall y and can be activated for any  study  or an 
appropriate document. Subjects with confirmed abnormal liver function testing should be 
followed as described below.
Confirmed moderatel y abnormal LFTs should be repeated 2- 3 times weekly  then weekl y or 
less if abnormalities stabilize or the study drug has been discontinued and the subject i s 
asymptomatic.  
Severe hepat ic liver function abnormalities as defined above, in the absence of another etiology , 
may beconsidered an important medical event and may be reported as a Serious Adverse 
Event (SAE).  The S ponsor should be contacted and informed of all subjects for whom severe 
hepatic liver function abnormalities possibly  attributable to study  drug are observed.
To further assess abnormal hepatic laboratory  findings, the investigator is expected to:

Version 3.0Incorporating Substantial Amendment s 1 & 2●Obtain a more detailed history  of symptoms and prior or concurrent diseases.  Sy mptoms 
and new onset -diseases should be recorded as ‘adverse events’ on the AE page of the
(e)CRF. Illnesses and conditions such as hy potensive events, and decompensated cardiac 
disease t hatmay lead to secondary  liver abnormalities should be noted. Non- alcoholic 
steatohepatitis (NASH) is seen in obese h yperlipoproteinemic, and/or diabetic patients 
and may  be associated with fluctuating aminotransferase levels.   The investigator should 
ensure that the medical history  form captures any  illness that pre -dates study  enrollment 
that may  be relevant in assessing hepatic function. 
●Obtain a history  of concomitant drug use (including non- prescription medication, 
complementary  and alternative medications), alcohol use, recreatio nal drug use, and 
special diets.  Medications, including dose, should be entered on the concomitant 
medicat ion page of the (e)CRF .  Information on alcohol, other substance use, and diet 
should be entered on the LA -CRF or an appropriate document .
●Obtain a history  of exposure to environmental chemical agents .
●Based on the subject ’s history ,  other testing may  be appropriate including: 
○acute viral hepatitis (A,B, C, D, E or other infectious agents) 
○ultrasound or other imaging to assess biliary  tract dise ase
○other laboratory  tests including INR, direct bilirubin
●Consider gastroenterology or hepatology  consultations.
●Submit results for any  additional testing and possible etiology  on the LA -CRF or an 
appropriate document.
Study Discontinuation
In the absence of an explanation for increased LFT ’s, such as viral hepatitis, pre-existing or 
acute liver disease or exposure to other agents associated with liver injury , the subject may  be 
discontinued from the study. The investigator may determine that it is not in the subject’s best 
interest to continue study enrollment. Discontinuation of treatment should be considered if:
●ALT or AST > 8 × ULN
●ALT or AST > 5 × ULN for more than 2 weeks 
●ALT or AST > 3 × ULN and TBL > 2 × ULN or INR > 1.5) (If INR testing is 
applicable/evaluated )
●ALT or AST > 3 × ULN with the appearance of fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper 
quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, rash and/or eosinophilia (> 5%). 
In addition, if close monitoring for a subject with moderate or severe hepatic l aboratory  tests is 
not possible, drug should be discontinued.

13.1 Attachment 1:  Substantial Amendment 2
I. The purpose of this amendment is:
Substantial Changes
1.Update Inclusion Criteria
DESCRI PTION OF CHANGE:
Inclusion Criteria #2 has been amended to specify  that in the United States of America 
subjects can onl y be included if aged ≥ 6 months to < 18 years .
RATIONALE:
Following the submission of Substantial Amendment 1 protocol version 2.0, dated 21 
November 2014, related to the widening of the inclusion criteria to open the study  for 
inclusion of children from birth onwards, the FDA raised concerns regarding the inclus ion of 
children younger than 6 months. The FDA is concerned that the extension of enrollment to 
children younger than 6 months of age will result in inclusion of subjects who are colonized 
rather than infected with C. difficile . 
Because the FDA has granted a waiver for the development of fidaxomicin for children from 
birth to 6 months due to the concern around diagnosis in this age group, subjects from birth 
to less than 6 months cannot be included in the 2819- CL-0202 US study  sites. 
Non-Substanti al Changes
1.Update Safety Reporting
DESCRI PTION OF CHANGE:
Removal of safet y reporting to delegated CRO for North American sites. 
RATIONALE:
Unify  the safet y reporting process for European and North American sites by  using the same 
delegated CRO.  
2.Update Contact Details of Key Sponsor Personnel
DESCRI PTION OF CHANGE:
Update contact details for the c linical research contact .

CLINICAL INVESTIGATION PLAN ( CIP) SYNOPSIS  
 
INVESTIGATION TITLE :  
A clinical investigation to study the effect of Exufiber Ag+ and other gelling fibre 
dressings on wound exudate and bioburden in medium to high exuding wound.  
 
Objectives  
This investigation is undertaken to investigate the impact of Exufiber Ag+ and other gelling  fibre 
dressings on handling exudate, changes in aerobic counts and microbial diversity of bioburden by 
collecting tissue and associated microbial virulence factors in  the wound exudate by collecting 
wound exudate, in medium to high exuding wound.  
Primary objective  
• To evaluate reduction  in exudate from baseline to last visit *. 
Secondary  objective  
• To evaluate changes in bioburden from baseline to visit 3 . 
• To evaluate the status of the wound and peri -wound skin from baseline to last visit * 
• To evaluate the  handling and technical  performance of the dressing from baseline  to last 
visit* 
• To evaluate comfort, conformability and acc eptability of the dressing from visit 3  to last 
visit* 
• To evaluate safety from baseline to last visit * 
*Last visit = Visit 5. Last vi sit occur earlier if the wound is dry or healed.  
** Distribution of patients included in the bioburden analysis can be found under 4.5.4  
For details  please see section 4.5.2 . 
Overall Design  
This is a non-randomised , prospective, multi -center, clinical investigation on medium to high 
exuding wou nd that will be conducted on approximately 105 subjects in US.  
An eligible subject is defined as a subject that fulfils  all the inclusion and none of the exclusion 
criteria . Both inpatient s and outpatient s/subjects will be eligible.

The target subject s are male or female, 18 year s or older who have a medium to high exuding 
wound . The objective s are to investigate the impact of Exufiber Ag+ and other gelling fibre 
dressing s on handling wound exudate, bioburden and possible associated molecular biomarkers . 
Each subject will be evaluated during 5 visits, with a total treatment period of  4 weeks  (28 days (± 
2 days) ) or earlier if the wound is dry  (see Table 1) or healed.  
Only one target wound  per patient  (indication specified in Appendix D, Instruction for use)  will be 
included in this investigation .  
Dressing change s will be done every 7 day s or earlier if needed according to instruction for use  
(see Appendix D)  and the sites local routines. Dressing changes will be record ed in the “Dressing 
Log”. Dressing changes between the scheduled visits will be record ed on the “ Dressing Log” at 
the next scheduled visit.  
The subject will be assigned either to Exufiber®Ag+, Exufiber® or Aquacel ™Ag Extra ™ (For 
details see  Figure 1).

1. INTRODUCTION  
Non-healing wounds are a significant problem for health -care systems worldwide. The presence 
of microorganisms in the wound, referred to as bioburden, negatively interfere s with the healing 
process1. 
Assessing the bioburden in slow healing wounds relies on the assessment of clinical signs of 
infection, which in many cases is a very blunt tool to predict the wound bioburden in patients2. 
While many dressings are designed or marketed to address the bioburden in wounds and 
suggest the reduction of bioburde n, very few methods are available to monitor this performance 
of a wound dressing in patients.  
While biopsies, the golden standard, provide an accurate picture of CFU counts even in t he 
deeper layer of skin tissue , they are invasive and offer only a small window into the total surface 
area of wounds. Some  other methods  commonly used , such as swa bbing provide a snapshot of 
the bioburden over the whole surface area of the wound but fail to provide an accurate 
measurement of the total bioburden deeper in the tissue.  
Some attempts have been made to identify chemical biomarkers to assess the bioburden status 
of the wound in an attempt to make the link between healing and non -healing wounds3. 
To correlate molecular biomarkers with overall reduction of the bioburden in the wound is difficult 
due to the time dependent appearance of biomarkers as well as their selectivity for certain 
strains. 16S DNA sequencin g provides as fast and detailed assessment of the wound microbiota 
and the relative amount of the various present species4. Viability PCR or Pre -rRNA analysis 
(MVT) allow a dead or alive distinction9. 
Culture testing is not as sensitive as molecular testing, so culturing often fails to detect b acteria, 
even bacteria that are present in a high relative abundance. Bacteria that are present in high 
relative abundance are likely of high clinical relevance, including the bacteria that are not 
detected by culture.  It also allows an absolute quantifica tion of the CFU count of the test sample5. 
Wound exudate samples can be used to identify molecular biomarkers such as enzymes, 
cytokines and metabo lites. The significance of the appearance and relative fold change of such 
biomarkers in combination with the change of bioburden of the wound is investigated and could 
provide crucial information to predict bioburden in wounds.  
Wounds that produce an excessive amount of exudate is  in an, inflammatory state. By reducing 
exudate the conditions for bacterial growth become less optimal. Gelling fibre dressings are 
developed to absorb and retain large amount of exudate to support an optimal wound healing 
process. Gelling fibre dressings with additional silver ions have in vitro  models shown to decreas e 
the number of microorganisms.  
Delayed healing often defined as clinical signs of infection (exudate, pain, discoloration, odour)6. 
Infected wounds are likely to be more painful and associated with high exudate levels which can 
increase the number of dressing changes required.  The negative effect on exces s exudate on 
wound healing can result in delayed healing, maceration of peri -wound skin and embarrassing

leakage for the patient. It is important that modern wound dressing can maintain moisture 
balance by absorbing excess exudate and preventing the wound drying out, in addition to being 
able to afford bacterial barrier properties in the wound are risk of infection, when required7. 
Majority of the si lver dressing studies have included endpoints related to healing , however more 
appropriate endpoints for silver dressing may related to measure microbial burden or assessment 
of clinic indicators of infection8. 
The current golden standard of antimicrobial gelling fibre dressing s is today Aquacel Ag and its 
further developed range of products such as Aquacel Ag Extra and Aquacel Ag+ Extra  (not on th e 
US only EU  market) . A new antimicrobial gelling fibre dressing (Exufiber Ag+) has been 
developed and is 510(k) cleared for sales in the United States.  
Exufiber Ag+ has been shown to have a higher retention capacity th an Aquacel Ag Extra.  The 
non-silver v ersion (Exufiber) has been on the market for a couple of years and both clinical 
investigations and customer feedback have confirmed the dressings high performance in exudate 
management. Two in vivo  studies on pigs where the antimicrobial properties of Exu fiber Ag+ 
were compared to both Exufiber and Aquacel Ag+ Extra have been performed. The results from 
these studies showed that Exufiber Ag+ was the most efficient treatment at reducing bioburden 
measured as established biofilms of MRSA and Pseudomonas  aeruginosa10,Error! Reference source not 
found.. 
Our study purpose  is to investigate the impact of Exufiber Ag+ and other gelling fibre dressing  on 
handling wound exudate, bioburden and possible associated molecular biomarkers. The study i s 
expected to provide a lot of important knowledge by combining advanced microbial detection 
techniques with dressing performance and clinical outcomes.  
2. OBJECTIVES  
This investigation is undertaken to investigate the impact of Exufiber Ag+ and other gellin g fibre 
dressings on handling exudate, changes in aerobic counts and microbial diversity of bioburden by 
collecting tissue and associated microbial virulence factors in  the wound exudate by collecting 
wound exudate, in medium to high exuding wound.  
Primary  objective  
• To evaluate reduction in exudate from baseline to last visit*.  
Secondary  objective  
• To evaluate changes in bioburden from baseline to visit 3.  
• To evaluate the status of the wound and peri -wound skin from baseline to last visit*  
• To evaluate the handling and technical performance of the dressing from baseline  to last 
visit*

4. INVESTIGATION PLAN AND PROCEDURES  
4.1 Overall Design and Flow Char t 
This non-randomised , prospective, multi -center, clinical  investigation on medium to  high 
exuding wound,  will be conducted at up to 15 sites on approximately 105  subjects in US.  
An eligible subject is defined as a subject that fulfils  all the inclusion and none of the 
exclusion criteria . Both inpatient and outpatient/subjects will be eligible. The target 
subject are male or female, 18 year o r older  who have  a medium to high exuding wound . 
The objectives  are to investigate the impact of  Exufiber Ag+ and other gelling fibre 
dressing on handling wound exudate, bioburden and possible associated molecular 
biomarkers  
Each subject will be evaluated during 5 visits, with a total treatment period of  4 weeks  (28 
days (± 2 days) ) or earlier if the wound is dry  (see Table 1) or healed.  
Only one target wound  per patient  (indication specified in Appendix D, Instruction for use)  
will be included in this investigation .  
The subject will be assigned either to Exufiber Ag+, Exufiber or Aquacel Ag Extra 
according t o Figure 1 Dressing distribution  flow chart . 
Dressing change will be done every 7 day s or earlier if needed according to instruction for 
use (see Appendix D)  and the sites local routines. Dressing changes will be record ed in 
the “Dressing Log”. Dressing changes between the scheduled visits will be record ed in 
the “ Dressing Log” at the next scheduled visit.  
Secondary dressing will be  chosen according to local routine.

4.5.8  Anticipated ADEs  
The following possible clinical outcomes have been identified as anticipated adverse device 
effects in connection to the risks evaluated in the Product Risk Management Record for : 
Exufiber Ag+  
• Maceration  
• Prolonged wound healing  
• Leakage leading to cross contamination or infection  
• Infection due to contaminat ion 
• Bacterial growth/Infection  
• Discolouration  
• Local allergic reaction  
• Sensitisation, cytotox, skin irritation  
• Selection for  resistant microorganisms  
• Anaemia due to potential systemic absorption of silver  
Exufiber  
• Maceration  
• Prolonged wound healing  
• Dressing related pain and/or trauma to the wound bed and edges  
• Infection  
Aquacel Ag Extra is assume d to have the same identified risk as Exufiber Ag+ , since Exufiber Ag 
+  is substantially equivalent with Aquacel Ag Extra.  
The investigator should take the  above mentioned list of events in consideration when reporting 
and assessing events in accordance with section 9 of the CIP.  
Based on the risk management recor d it can be concluded , that for Exufiber Ag+ , Exufiber  and 
Aquacel Ag Extra, there are no unacceptable risks of harm for the patient, the user nor third part 
involved in this clinical investigation, if the treatment dressings are  used under normal conditions 
and within its intended use.  
Before reaching the above conclusion, the identified risks of the investigational device, which had 
been ranked for severity, occurrence and detectability according to Mölnlycke risk management 
process,  were mitigated as far as  possible in the risk management process (following ISO 14971, 
Application of Risk Management to Medical Devices).  
4.6 Data Quality Assurance  
4.6.1  Monitoring, Audits and Inspections  
During the investigation, the monitor will have regular contacts with the investigation site. These 
contacts will include visits to confirm that the facilities remain adequate to specified standards

Viedoc, a web based e CRF system, will be used to capture data in this investigation. The eCRF 
system complies with FDA Title 21 CFR part 11 (ER/ES) requirement.  
eCRF training will be given to appropriate personnel before/at initiation of the investigation site(s).  
Data entry will be done by investigators and other authorized personnel at the site(s). When 
entering data on -line checks are incorporated in Viedoc fo r consistency and validation.  
Pharma Consulting Group will support with a helpdesk function taking care of system user 
questions regarding Viedoc.  
When data has been entered authorized personnel at Mölnlycke  can immediately view the data, 
send queries if n ecessary and lock eCRF pages when they have been validated.  
Photos will be uploaded in Viedoc and are marked with the subject code. Uploaded photos shall 
not contain any information that can reveal the identity of the subject. All uploaded photos will be 
reviewed by personnel at Mölnlycke  and stored in the company database. All data entered in 
Viedoc will be encrypted. The physical database will be stored in Sweden.  
Records will be retained for a minimum of 10 years after end of the clinical investigation or last 
product is manufactured whichever is more stringent. In addition investigation sites shall keep 
their records longer if in accordance with local requirements.  
Programs for post -entry checks and data listings will be created and executed for validat ion of 
data.  
Completeness will be checked by authorized personnel at Mölnlycke  so that there are no 
unexplainable empty fields in Viedoc. This is done in order to prevent that data have been 
overlooked by personnel entering the data.  
A clean -file meeting will be held prior to database lock. All decisions on the evaluability of the 
data from each individual subject for the statistical analysis must be made and documented 
before locking the database.

last observation carry forward (LOCF) will be applied from 1 week.  
A sensitivity analysis will be performed for primary analysis with complete cases.  
Complementary analyses will be perfo rmed on the PP population and for change from baseline to 
3 days, 1 week, 2 weeks and 3 weeks.   
Since primary efficacy variable and most of the secondary efficacy variables are ordered 
categorical or dichotomous variables the Sign test will be used for ana lysis of change within 
groups for these types of variables and described with number and percentages of improved, not 
changed and worsened. For primary efficacy variable and important secondary efficacy variables 
a complete cross tabulation baseline and 4 weeks will be given.  
All significance test will be two -sided and conducted at the 5 % significance level.  
Continuous variables will be described with mean, SD, median, minimum and maximum and 
categorical variables will be given with number and percentages.  All measured variables will be 
describes by visit.  
The statistical analysis of the groups treated with Exufiber or Aquacel Ag Extra will be analysed 
separately with the same statistical methods as specified above. The database for Exufiber Ag+ 
will be declare clean  and will be analysed before the other two treatment groups are finalised . 
 
Patient Disposition and Data Sets Analysed  
The number of subjects included in each of the ITT, PP and safety populations will be 
summarized. The number and percentage of subjects enrolled and treated will be presented. 
Subjects who completed the study and subjects who withdrew from study prematurely will also be 
presented with a breakdown of the reasons for withdrawal for the ITT, PP and safety populations.  
 
Protocol Viola tions/Deviations  
Major protocol deviations are those that are considered to have an effect on the  primary  analysis.  
A list of potential major protocol deviations will be generated programmatically from the data 
captured before the clean file meeting. The listings from  the clinical investigation  will be review ed 
and the finalisation of the major protocol deviations will be done at the clean file meeting.  
The number of patients with major protocol deviations will be summarized.  
Demographics and Baseline Characteristics  
All variables measured at baseline will be summarized for the ITT - and PP population using 
appropriate summary statistics  for the three treatment groups.  
Medical and Surgical History  
Listings of all medications collected for each subject by  the investigator will be produced.

4.7.2  Performance Analysis  
Primary Performance Analyses  
The primary performance analysis will be th e analysis of change in Exudate level from baseline to 
4 weeks in the Exufiber Ag+ treatment group with the two -sided Sign test on the  Intent To Treat 
(ITT)-population at significance level 0.05. If the 4 weeks value is missing last observation carry 
forwa rd (LOCF) will be allied from 1 week.  
A complementary sensitive analysis will be performed with the same analysis on complete cases. 
(No imputation)  
Secondary Efficacy Analyses  
All secondary efficacy variables will be analysed within the treatment groups  for the ITT - and Per 
Protocol ( PP) population using the statistical methods given in section general methodology. 
Primary efficacy variable will also be analysed on the PP -population  
4.7.3  Determination of Sample Size  
In the study PUMA 416, with 100 subjects treated with Mepilex  without Ag, the result regarding 
change in Exudate level from baseline to 4 weeks was 56.5 % improved, 32.9 % unchanged and 
10.6 % worsened. Assuming the same proportions in this study 38 subjec ts are needed to find a 
significant improvement with the Sign test with 95% power and significance level 0.05. If we 
expect a dropout rate of around 20% we will include 50 subjects in the Exufiber Ag+ treatment 
group . 
4.8 Changes to the  Clinical  Investigation Plan  
No change in the investigation procedure will be effected without the mutual agreement of the 
Principal Investigator and Mölnlycke.  
An amendment to the Investigation Plan may require notification or approval from IRB before 
implementation. Local requi rements must be followed.  
Mölnlycke will distribute clinical investigation plan amendments to the Principal Investigator who 
is responsible for the distribution of these documents to the IRB and s taff concerned at his/her 
site.

4) medical or surgical intervention to prevent life-threatening illness or injury or permanent 
impairment to a body struct ure or a body function.  
c) led to foetal distress, foetal death or a congenital abnormality or birth defect.  
Note:  Planned hospitalization for a pre -existing condition, or a procedure required by the CIP, 
without serious deterioration in health, is not considered a serious adverse event.  
Pregnancy is not considered a Serious Adverse Event.  
Serious Adverse Device Effect (SA DE) 
Adverse Device Effect that has resulted in any of the consequences characteristic of a Serious 
Adverse Event.  
PROCEDURES FOR SAE AND/OR SADE REPORTING OR REPORTING OF DD THAT 
COULD HAVE LED TO A SADE  
The investigator must inform, within  1 calendar  day of awareness of the event. When a 
SAE/SADE has been entered into the eCRF by the investigator /authorised site staff, the eCRF 
system will automatically generate a report to: 
Clinical_Investigations_Event_Reporting@molnlycke.com.  
In case of problem with  the eCRF, a paper based version of the SAE/SADE report form (available 
in the Investigator Site File) shall be used and sent by email to: 
Clinical_Investigations_Event_Reporting@molnlycke.com.  
All SAEs/SADEs that occur  during the Clinical Investigation shall be reported, whether or not they 
are considered causally related to the investigational device [or the comparator].  
Device Deficiencies that might have led to SADE if either a) suitable action had not been taken, 
b) if intervention had not been made, or c) if circumstances had been less fortunate must be 
reported as a SADE.  
The investigator is responsible for informing the EC/IRB and/or the Competent Authority of the 
SAE/SADE as per local requirements.  
PROCEDURES FOR  DD REPORTING  
All DD shall be reported to Mölnlycke  as soon as poss ible, without unjustified delay . If the DD 
might have led to a SADE the reporting requirements for SADE described above must be 
followed. DDs can be either subject related or non -subject r elated depending on if the 
investigational device was used by a subject or not. Separate forms are used for subject related 
and non -subject related DDs. When a subject related DD has been entered into the eCRF by the 
investigator /authorised site staff, th e eCRF system will automatically generate a report to:

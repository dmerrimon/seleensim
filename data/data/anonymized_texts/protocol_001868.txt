More than one million skin  cancer cases occur annually.1 Most of these forms of skin cancers are 
curable.  Carcinoma is a medical wo rd for a cancer that starts in a lining layer of cells such as the 
skin or the lining cells of the digestive system. There are many t ypes of keratinocyte cancer, but 
two types of epithelia l skin cancers are most common, basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and 
squamous cell carcinoma (SCC).    
Epithelial skin cancer is a common neoplasm that affects more than a half of a million people 
each year.  The most serious of skin can cers is melanoma, which was diagnosed in 
approximately 60,000 people in 2007.  However, the majority of these lesi ons, estimated to be 
eighty to ninety percent, are basa l cell cancers and the remainder is categorized as squamous cell.   
Both types of malignancies are related to  ultraviolet light exposure from the sun.1-3 Basal cell 
cancer begins in the lowest laye r of the epidermis, the basal cell layer. About eight out of ten 
skin cancers are BCCs. They usually begin on areas  exposed to the sun, such as the head and 
neck. BCC was once found mostly in middle-aged or  older people, in the fourth decade of life 
and beyond. But now it is also being seen in younger people. This may be because people are 
spending more time in the sun w ithout protecting their skin.  BCC tends to grow slowly. It is 
very rare for a basal cell cancer to metastasize. Bu t if left untreated, it can grow into nearby areas 
and spread into the bone or ot her tissues beneath the skin.  
SCCs are more likely to spread into fatty tissues  just beneath the skin. They are also more likely 
to spread to lymph nodes or to distant parts of the body than ar e BCCs, but this is not common.   
With thorough screening these neoplasms can be iden tified at an early stag e.  With the selection 
of the appropriate treatment option, these canc ers can result in excelle nt local control with 
excellent cosmesis results.1, 2 
There has been a diverse variety of modalities developed for the treatment of basal cell and SCC 
over the years, from surgical excision to M ohs micrographic surgery, to radiation therapy.   The 
location of the cancer and the extent of the dis ease effect the treatment options available to 
patients.3 The following section provides an overview of the different treatment modalities 
published in the literature. 
Lovett et al reported on 339 patients who were cons ecutively treated for hi stologically confirmed 
basal cell (71%) and squamous cell (29%) carcinoma.5 A retrospective study was performed to 
assess local recurrence.   The majority of the basal cell lesions (93%) and 97% of the SCCs were 
on the head.  Radiation therapy was the initial treatment modality in 212 patients, and 127 
patients were treated with radiation therapy after the initial surgical excision failed.  Tumor 
control was analyzed by the type of external beam radiation therapy administered.  The local 
control for superficial x-ray ranged from 91 to 100% reported cat egorically by tumor size.  
Page 6 of 18   December 28, 2021  Xoft, Inc., a subsidiary  of iCAD, Inc.  CONFIDENTIAL   CTPR-0019    REV B  Electron beam ranged from 70 to 75% local control.  Patients were stratified into groups by the 
type of radiation beam used on the treatment.  Excellent to good cosmesis was seen in 97% of 
the patients treated with superficial X-rays and in  78% of the patients tr eated with electrons, 78% 
of the patients treated with mixed beams, and in 80% of the patients treated with megavoltage 
photons.  The overall complication rate (complicati ons were defined as grade 4 toxicities4) for the 
310 patients whose data was available was 5.5%.  Of the 217 previously untreated patients, the 
complication rate was 3.2%.,5 
Silva et al report on a retrospective review of  radiation therapy treatment for basal cell, 
squamous cell, and basal-SCC from 313 patients w ith 334 lesions treated.  The objective of this 
study was to assess local control and late toxicitie s in patients treated wi th radiation therapy for 
the treatment of cancer of the pinna of the ear .  For 270 patients, radiation therapy was the 
primary treatment, 50 patients received radiati on therapy for recurrent cancer that had not 
previously undergone resection, and 12 patients received radia tion therapy as an adjuvant 
treatment.6 
 Orthovoltage X-ray radiation therap y (100-250 kV) was used in 83% of the patients, and electron 
radiation therapy was used in approximately 12%.  The rest were treated with megavoltage X-
rays (primarily 
60Cobalt).  The prescriptions were as fo llows: 17.5 Gy-20 Gy in  one fraction, 35 
Gy in five fractions with 7 Gy per fraction, 42 -45 Gy in ten fractions  with 4.2 to 4.5 Gy per 
fraction, and 50 to 60 Gy divided among 20 to 30 fra ctions with less than 3 Gy per fraction.  
Thirty-five (35) Gy was prescribed for 124 of  the 313 patients.  The follow-up ranged from 0.12 
to 13.37 years.  The primary endpoint was time to  local failure, and the secondary endpoint was 
significant grade 4 late toxicities.  Local contro l rate was reported to be  9% for patients who 
present with early-stage cancer with tumor size 2cm or less in diameter .  Orthovoltage X-ray 
radiation therapy has been show n to be efficacious primary tr eatment for squamous cell and 
BCC.6 
 Chan et al report on a single cent er experience for the treatment of basal cell and SCCs.  They 
studied 1005 lesions treated with  single fraction radiotherapy.  Th is retrospectiv e chart review 
took place ten years later to allow for follow-up.   All patients were treated with 45-100 kV X-
ray.  The radiation doses administered were 22.5 Gy, 20 Gy and 18 Gy.  The 18 Gy prescription 
was reserved for patients who were considered  frail or had very small tumors.  The study 
endpoints were recurrence and late necrosis over a ten-year period.   There was no difference in 
the recurrence rate for the group treated with 20 Gy versus  22 Gy, but there was a significant 
increase in late skin necrosis rate (p=0.002).  Most tumors were in the head and neck regions.  
One subgroup in this study, patients who received radi ation therapy for the treatment of cancer of 
the inner canthus of the ear, showed a higher recurrence rate because  of the concavity, or 
standoff, of the treatment area.  Chan concl uded that a standoff of 0.5 cm-1.5 cm would cause 
the radiation dose to decrease by six to 23%.

Page 7 of 18   December 28, 2021  Xoft, Inc., a subsidiary  of iCAD, Inc.  CONFIDENTIAL   CTPR-0019    REV B  Guix et al. published their series of 136 patients with basal cell or  SCC of the skin of the face 
treated with surface molds and Ir-192 HDR brachyt herapy with 98% 5-year local control rate 
with no severe early or la te complications detected.7  
Other treatment options for patien ts with basal cell or SCCs include curettage, Mohs surgery and 
conventional surgery.  Curettage has been said to  be quick, requires mini mal equipment, and is 
associated with a cure rate of 90%  or better for select low-risk skin cancers. With this strategy, 
however, there is no margin contro l, and healing and cosmesis can be variable; moreover, it is 
not a very effective treatmen t for high-risk tumors and tumors in certain locations.3, 5, 6 
A common treatment for non-melanoma skin can cer (NMSC) has been Mohs surgery, which 
uniquely orients, maps, and processes removed tissue, permitting the microscopic evaluation of 
virtually 100% of the specimen margins. The comp leteness of this marg in control permits the 
accurate identification and rem oval of all tumor extensions under the microscope. Tissues in 
Mohs surgery are processed as modified frozen sections whic h allow the accurate and rapid 
interpretation of most skin cancers.6,9 For those patients where surgical  resection is not an option, 
primary treatment with radiation therapy was select ed for patients whose data  will be collected in 
this study.  The treatment approach  was individualized based on speci fic risk factors, and patient 
characteristics for the most acceptabl e cosmetic and functional outcome.10, 11 
5 STUDY RATIONALE 
Non-melanoma skin cancers, BCC and SCC, are the most prevalent of all skin cancers.  Multiple 
publications have shown that radi ation therapy using kil ovoltage X-rays is a viable option for the 
treatment of BCC and SCC but tr eatment must be individualized to determine if radiation 
therapy should be an adjuvant th erapy following surgical  resection or if the radiation therapy is 
the primary treatment fo r skin cancer.  Local recurrence ra te varies depending on the histology, 
BCC versus SCC. SCC has a higher recurrence rate than BCC; deat hs have been at tributed to the 
recurrence of SCC.2, 5, 6, 11-14 
 
Brachytherapy has the advantage of delivering a high dose to the tumor while sparing the 
surrounding normal tissues. With proper case se lection and delivery technique, high-dose rate 
(HDR) brachytherapy has great pro mise, allows short treatment ti mes, and can be performed on 
an outpatient basis.15 The Xoft Axxent Electronic Brachyt herapy (eBx) System allows for the 
administration of high dose rate  brachytherapy treatments using an  electronic source.  The Xoft 
Axxent System Controller a nd Source are cleared by the United States Food and Drug 
Administration to deliver high dose rate X-ray radiation for brachytherapy.   
 
A matched pairs study was completed previously  comparing eBx treatme nt outcomes to Mohs 
surgery outcomes. The median follow-up was thr ee years.  Local recurrence, toxicities, and 
cosmesis were the endpoints.16 Because of the excellent cosmetic outcomes evident in this study 
at three years, the physicians rated cosmesis as “excellent” or “good” in 97.6% of EBx-treated 
Page 8 of 18   December 28, 2021  Xoft, Inc., a subsidiary  of iCAD, Inc.  CONFIDENTIAL   CTPR-0019    REV B  lesions, and 95.7% of MMS-treated lesions, co smetic outcomes in this study will not be 
collected.16 It is most important to understand the long-term recurre nce rates for this treatment 
option. The rationale for this retrospective data  collection study is to understand longer-term 
outcomes in patients treated with eBx for the treatment of both BCC and SCC NMSC.   
6 STUDY PURPOSE 
The purpose of this retrospective-prospective study is to evaluate lesions after treatment for BCC 
or SCC NMSC in order to gain a better understa nding of the durability of the treatment, and risk 
of late toxicities for th is patient population.    
7 STUDY DESIGN, ENROLLMENT, AND DURATION 
7.1 Study Design 
This is a retrospective-prospective st udy design. The study is post-market, on-label 
observational study for the treat ment of NMSC.  Patients  who completed treatment 
at least five years from the last treatment  will be identified and existing data as 
required by this protocol in  the patient’s record will be collected in addition to 
conducting office visits or te lehealth visits (video) fo r long-term follow-up.     
 
The study will include:   
Identifying patients, retrospectively, w ho completed treatment a minimum of five 
years from the last treatment. The histor y and demographic data will be collected 
from up to 300 subjects previ ously treated with eBx fo r the treatment of NMSC. 
Patients will have an office visit or telehea lth visit in order for the investigators to 
assess the lesion site, document absence of recurrence, treatment for recurrence (if 
applicable), and long-term t oxicities at the time of the prospective visit.   
7.2 Sample Size 
Up to 300 subjects treated with eBx will have  data collected retrospectively from the 
patient’s medical records, and prospectively at the time of the follow-up visit for 
those who agree to participate in this study.  Up to three lesions  per subject may be 
included in this study. The sample si ze will include those who were treated 
previously with eBx per the st andard of care treatment as pu blished in Patel et al and 
Doggett et al.16-17 
7.3 Study Objective 
Evaluate long-term local recurrence ( ≥ 5 years post-treatment) of eBx treated lesions 
at follow-up.  
7.4  Primary Effectiveness Endpoint 
Absence of local recurrence at ≥ 5-year follow-up at treatment site(s).

8 METHODOLOGY 
8.1 Identifying the Population 
The first phase of this study w ill be to identify patients who completed tr eatment with 
eBx at least five year s ago prior to study onset and coll ect history and demographic data, 
and eligibility data retrospectively from th e patient records and on source worksheets.  
This phase will include a review of the site’s medical records to determine if the source 
documentation contains the variables that are needed to determine eligibility, and which 
will be used in the endpoint analyses.   
 
 
Page 10 of 18   December 28, 2021  Xoft, Inc., a subsidiary of  iCAD, Inc.  CONFIDENTIAL   CTPR-0019    REV B  These variables include: 
Patient Age 
Pathology report for evidence of: 
o Lesion size (cm) / TNM stage 
o Lesion diagnosis (BCC, SCC) 
Last treatment date for each location Lesion location (e.g. face, extremit ies, neck, nose, scalp, torso) 
 
Data Collected Prospectively: 
Recurrence of cancer at pr ospective follow-up visit  
Recurrence occurred prior to prospective follow-up visit 
Long term skin toxicity (g raded according to CTCAE v.5) 
8.2 Long-term Follow-up Visits 
Patient Selection: Patients who are due for th eir annual skin assess ment with a minimum 
of five years since their last eBx treatment will be selected  to call for an appointment.  
The patients who were in prior studies will be called from a list kept at the study sites.  
Additional patients who were not in the previo us studies will be contacted if they meet 
eligibility criteria.  The patient will be told  about the study and asked if they would be 
willing to participate in the Xoft study through an on-site or remote telehealth 
appointment.   
On-site Visits:  Patients agreeable to particip ating that return for an office visit for 
prospective data collection will be offered $100.00 compen sation for his/her time and 
effort required to participate in this study.  Written informed  consent will be required for

Study site monitoring (remote or  on-site) will be performed by the CRO. Each site will be 
monitored on-site or remotely on a regular sche dule to ensure that the study is conducted in 
Page 13 of 18   December 28, 2021  Xoft, Inc., a subsidiary of  iCAD, Inc.  CONFIDENTIAL   CTPR-0019    REV B  compliance with sponsor requirements, the protoc ol, GCP, and the applicable regulations. The 
monitor will also ensure that th e data reported is consistent w ith the informa tion found in the 
subject’s medical records (source data verificat ion) and in source documents. Monitoring will 
include the assessment of the site ’s overall progress, including but not  limited to the site’s ability 
to keep accurate records and to report study-rela ted data to the sponsor in a timely fashion. 
Monitoring of each site will be performed according to the CRO’s Interim Monitoring Visits 
Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) and the monito ring plan.  In order to appropriately monitor 
the progress of the study, the site will provide the sponsors and/or its designees access to all 
source documents and other inform ation necessary to ensure investigator compliance with the 
protocol and applicable rules and regulations, and to assess  the progress of this study. 
 The sponsors designees will maintain contact with the investigator and staff throughout 
the duration of the study by phone, e-mail, and re mote or on-site visits.  The monitor will 
compile and file a monitoring report for each vis it.  Monitoring will ensu re continued protocol 
compliance, adequate patient enrollme nt, and accurate data reporting.   
The monitor will verify: 
1. Informed Consent Forms (ICF)s for on-site visits will be obtained from each subject prior to 
the participation in this study, and the ICF process is clearly and contemporaneously 
documented in the medical record. 
2. For remote visits, informed consent will be provided verbally by the participant prior to 
commencing with the prospective data collection at the time of  the visit.  The signature on 
the informed consent will be waived for remote visits.   
3. The data in the CRF are completed and reco rded and provided to the study management 
team (CRO), in a timely manner. 
4. Findings of non-compliance are revi ewed with the Investigator(s ) and disclosed in a written 
monitoring report 
5. Source Data Verification – Risked based moni toring will be implemented, and source data 
verification will be performed  according to the monitoring plan for the Xoft Study.  
6. Site Close-Out: At the time of the site close- out visit, the site monitor will collect all 
outstanding study documents, ensure  that the investig ator’s files are acc urate and complete, 
review record retention require ments with the investigator, a nd ensure that all applicable 
requirements are met for the study.   
7. Study Materials: Each Site will receive all the necessary materi als needed to initiate and 
participate in this clinical study.  The materials include, but are not limited to: 
 Regulatory Binder and Contents 
1. Protocol 
2. Delegation of Authority Log  
3. Subject Screening Log 
4. Training Log

12 INFORMED CONSENT PROCESS:  ON -SITE VISITS AND REMOTE VISITS 
 
12.1  On-site Visits Informed Consent 
 
Potential study subjects will be called to dete rmine interest in part icipation in the Xoft 
follow-up study. Should the person be interested, the patient will be scheduled for a follow-
up appointment that is in line wi th the next clinic visit requi red by insurance or Medicare. 
Once the patient arrives at the office, the st udy will be explained, and the consent will be 
reviewed and any questions the patient may have  will be answered.  Should the patient agree 
to be a participating study subject, the informed consent will be signed and dated by the 
patient and the person providing informed consent. The subject  will receive a copy of the 
consent and proceed with the visit. The inves tigator (MD or other healthcare professional) 
who is qualified to participate as an investig ator shall assess the treatment locations and 
document if there is a local recurrence or late to xicity and grade the late  toxicity according to 
CTCAE criteria. Once this is complete the subject has completed study participation. 
 12.2 Remote Visits Informed Consent  
 
Potential study subjects who choose to partic ipate remotely by a vi deo conference will be 
scheduled for a call that meets the regulatory re quirements of a visit.  The video will start 
with the delegated site personne l reviewing the elements of th e informed consent for this 
study.  Once the consent has been provided verbally, the visit may begin.  In this scenario, 
the waiver of informed consent documentation applies.  The study site personnel will 
document that they provided informed consent and that the patient provided verbal approval 
and consent to participate, with a written in formed consent form be ing waived for these 
subjects.  All California sites will be requi red to obtain subject acknowledgement/signature 
in agreement with the California Bill of Ri ghts.  The investigator (MD or healthcare 
provider) who is qualified to participate as an investigator shall remotely assess the treatment 
locations and document if there is a local recu rrence or late toxicity  and grade the late 
toxicity if applicable. Once th is is complete, the subject ha s completed study participation. 
 
Should there be a situation where the lesion  on a remote particip ant is suspect for a 
recurrence development, the site will proceed with standard of care. 
13  STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
13.1 Data Collection 
Data will be collected at the study site on cas e report form and will be entered into the 
online database by site and/or ECR personnel.  The EDC system for the on-line database 
will be HIPAA compliant and 21 CFR compliant. The data entry personnel will be 
Page 15 of 18   December 28, 2021  Xoft, Inc., a subsidiary of  iCAD, Inc.  CONFIDENTIAL   CTPR-0019    REV B  separate from the monitoring personnel. D ouble data entry will take place to ensure 
accuracy.  The following data collection requirements are listed below:

13.2 Statistical Analyses 
This is a multi-center,  retrospective-prospect ive study comparing non-m elanoma skin cancer 
treatment (basal cell carcinoma and squamous  cell carcinoma) using Xoft electronic 
brachytherapy (eBx) results. The primary endpoint is freedom from recurrence at five-year 
follow-up or longer. The secondary safety endpoint is late skin  toxicities as assessed at the 
time of the prospective follow-up vi sit.  This study is not powere d, as it is for the purpose of 
reporting the number and percent of subject s who had a recurrence and the number and 
percent of subjects who showed a late skin toxi city at the follow-up visit.  The data will be 
analyzed and reported by subject and by lesion. The final analysis from the study will be 
reported as descriptive statistics , both categorical and continuous variables, as appropriate.  
14 PUBLICATIONS AND PRESENTATIONS 
The analyses from this study shall be publishe d and presented by the sponsor.  Should an 
investigator from a study site wi sh to publish or present the data , this must be pre-approved by 
the study sponsor. The sponsor has th e right to present the data firs t prior to sites presenting site 
data and multi -center data.

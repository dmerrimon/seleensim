1.0 BACKGROUND  
Radiofrequency (RF) technology is commonly used in surgery, minimally invasive  treatments 
and aesthetic applic ations . RF technology is a safe method for non -ablative (A nonwounding 
device treatment which stimulates collagen growth and tightens underlying skin ) treatment 
because  energy can  be precisely delivered through the skin to the dermal tissue beneath without 
damaging the epidermis.  The gentle heating of deep dermal tissue induces collagen 
denaturation, contraction, and subsequent synthesis.  The collagen synthesis, in turn, creates a 
tightening effect that helps to eliminate mild to modera te facial wrink les and rhytid es (A wrinkle, 
typically a facial wrinkle secondary to muscular co ntraction patterns in the skin ) and is used also 
for other cosmetic treatments on the body.  Radiofrequency surgery  is currently used to remo ve 
lesions such as moles, warts and skin tags  and perform cosmetic surgeries such as, but not 
limited to; blepharoplasties , abdominoplasties, breast augmentations, face lifts, labiaplasties, 
and vaginoplasties.  It involves the passage of radio waves into the skin to perform the removal 
or reshaping o f a lesion. Different types of electrodes are used depending on the type of lesion  
(e.g. fine needle, wire loop, scalpel blade etc. ). 
 
In this study t his family of generators will be tested  for: 
Gene ral surgical procedures such as  (but not limited to) ; 
o Urologic, thoracic, plastic, reconstructive and gynecological  
o Electrosurgical coagulation (hemostasis or coagulating) of tissue  
o Epilation and telangiectasia  
 
 Non-ablative /aesthetic  treatments such as  (but not limited to) ; 
• Facial wrinkles and rhytids  
• Heating for the purpose of elevating tissue temperature for selected medical conditions 
such as temporary relief of pain, muscle spasms, an d increase in local circulation  
• Temporary reduction in the appearance of cellulite

• Standard pre -treatment instructions will be reviewed,  and the subject will be  instructed 
to adhere to the following:  
o Do not receive other treatments within the study area for the duration of the 
study.  
o If treatment is on the face;  
1. Do not apply any products or makeup to general eye area for 12 hours 
(or more) prior to each study visit.  
2. Remove makeup and wash facial area prio r to treatment.  
o Please remove all makeup, and any lotions or sun block  from the treatment 
area. Any preparations left on the skin will act as impedance to the energy and 
will diminish the effects.  
o The treatment area must be free of any open lesions or infections.  
o For an optimum treatment, hydrate by drinking water or hydrating fluids several 
days in preparation. Avoid alcohol if possible. The same procedure should be 
followed prior to each visit.  
 
4.8 Treatment  
• Radiofrequency Device Treatment : 
o The type of treatment will determine if gel  should be applied to the skin prior to 
treatment. The gel is a conductive gel created for  treatments that use radio 
frequency (RF) to ensure  the proper connection between the hand piece and 
the skin. 
o A neutral pad will be used in accordance with the operator’s  manual for the 
device.  
o The hand piece, applicator or tip will be placed in contact with the skin.  
o The entire defined treatment area will then be treated by delivering  energy to 
the skin . 
o The ha nd piece, number of passes and parameters used for the treatment will 
be determined by the Investigator.  
o Parameters may be adjusted throughout the treatment to increase subject 
comfort.  
o Contact cooling built into the 60mm handpiece may be used to increase subject 
comfort.  
o Nitronox may be used  to increase subject comfort  and will be determined by the 
Investigator.  
• Procedural adverse eve nts will be documented.  
• Subjects  will be asked to report the general level of treatment discomfort /pain  on a 
scale of 0 (none) to 10 (maximum intolerabl e pain) . 
• Some subjects may have an incomplete response or no response  by the end of the 
study. At the end of the study treatments using an FDA approved/cleared treatment 
method may be discussed with the subj ect and obtained at the cost of the subject.  
 
4.9  Post -Treatment  
• Photographs may be taken post treatment.  
• Standard post -treatment care instructions will be reviewed  and may be instructed to 
adhere to the following:  
o Wash skin with tepid water and a gentle cleanser.   
o If the skin is slightly pink or red in areas following the treatment, avoid hot water 
when washing or showering until any erythema (redness) has subsided.

o Makeup (preferably mineral -based) is not encourag ed but may be applied 
immediately post -treatment.  
o Soothing creams or moisturizers may be used.  
o If the treatment area may be exposed to the sun; u se a sun block with an SPF 
of 30 or gr eater to help prevent sun damage. This treatment does not cause 
photosens itivity . 
• Subjects may be given a diary to assess recovery time to be completed during the 
week post the treatment.  
• Subjects and clinicians may be asked to complete a treatment experience 
questionnaire.  
 
4.10 Follow Up  
• Subjects  will receive a phone call or attend a visit  2 days and/or  1-week  post 
treatment to record side effects.  If a side effect is tracked, the site will continue 
to call the subject until the event resolves.  If deemed necessary by the 
investigator, the subject may  attend an unscheduled visit for side effect 
assessment.  
• The subject may return for a follow up visit at 30, 90 and 180 days post last 
treatment for side effect and efficacy assessments.  
• The assessments listed in the schedule of a ctivities  and observations  table  
(Section 4.13)  will be performed at all follow up visits . 
• Adverse events will be assessed at all follow up visits.  
 
4.11 Unscheduled Visits  
An unscheduled visit may be performed at any time during the study at the subject’s 
request or as deemed necessary by the site Investigator. The date and reason for the 
unscheduled visit will be recorded in the source documentation.

Protocol: CYN17 -RF-CLINIC                                                                                                                                    Cynosure, Inc.  
Version 13: March 20, 2019  4.14 Evaluation Methods  
Photographs:  
Photographs will be taken at all visits and will be used to assess safety and efficacy of 
treatment.  
 
Treatment Discomfort /Pain Evaluation : 
Subjects will be asked to report the general level of treatment discomfort on a scale of 0 
(none) to 10 (maximum intolerable pain)  using the universal pain assessment tool 
(Appendix B)  
 
Subject Experience E valuation:  
Subjects will be asked to complete a questionnaire to assess their treatment experience.  
 
User Experience Evaluation:  
The clinician will be asked to complete a questionnaire to assess the usability of the 
device.  
 
Diary:  
A subject diary may be collected to assess the recovery time of the treatment for 7 days 
post treatment.  
 
Subject Satisfaction :  
The subject will be asked their level of satisfaction using a 6-point  Likert scale that range s 
from “extremely satisfied” to “extremely unsatisfied. ”  
 
Rating  Description  
6 Extremely Satisfied  
5 Satisfied  
4 Slightly Satisfied  
3 Slightly Unsatisfied  
2 Dissatisfied  
1 Extremely Unsatisfied  
 
 
Ultrasound (U/S) : 
An ultrasound scan is a medical test that uses sound waves to capture live images from 
the inside of the body. The subject will most likely be lying down on a table with a section 
of their body exposed for the test.  A special lubricating jelly will be applied to their skin. 
This prevents friction between the ultrasound transducer —similar in appearance to a 
microphone — and the skin. The jelly also helps transmit the sound waves. After the 
procedure, the gel will be cleaned off the subject. The whole procedure typically lasts less 
than 30 minutes. Following it, the subject will be free to go about their day and normal 
activities.  
 
Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT)  
An OCT device uses a very low power laser that is directed at the skin. The reflected light 
is captured by the device t o provide images of the skin layer down to 1 millimeter depth. It 
may be used to help evaluate the effect of RF exposure on the skin. The subject will be 
asked to lay down and the device’s arm will be brought into contact with the skin area of 
interest. De pending on the area of skin to be measured, the exam will take 15 to 30 
minutes to perform.

4.15 Adverse Event  Assessment  
Recording of adverse events will take place at all visits.  
 
4.16 Adverse Event Recording  
All data captured must be supported by the Investigator’s timely assessment and 
documentation of the event in the case report forms or source documents .  All 
documented adverse events will be reviewed by the Sponsor or designee to determine 
whether the adv erse event meets regulatory reporting requirements and to ensure timely 
adverse event reporting to meet local and global regulatory requirements.  
 
Adverse Events Pertaining to the Radiofrequency Device:  
Mild discomfort during treatment m ay be experienced by the subject . Typically,  the 
discomfort is temporary and localized within the treatment area.  Mild edema ( swelling ) and 
erythema ( redness ) may occur. Initial studies indicate that these side effects typically 
resolve within 2 to 24 hours.  
 
Other a nticipated side effects  may include; pain, skin burns, bleeding, scarring , crusting, 
bruising, infection, itching , prolonged  edema ( swelling ), and erythema  (redness ), hardness, 
and nodules . Loss of hair pigment  may also occur within and adjacent to the treatment 
area.  
 
Adverse Events Pertaining to Surgical Marker:  
Using surgical marker has minimal risks and may produce effects on the body such as 
redness or a rash. Markings may remain visible for a few days or may be removed with 
alcohol.  
 
Adverse Events Pertain ing to Gel : 
The gel is a water -based  gel that may be placed on the skin during an RF treatment. No 
known adverse events are documented . However, an allergic reaction is always possible 
when placing a topical gel  onto the skin. Allergic reaction may include a mild reaction such 
as skin rednes s, irritation or hives.  
 
Eye injury due to direct ocular Radiofrequency  exposure may occur : 
Corneal Eye Shields ( sterile, plastic, non -conductive) must be used for any radiofrequency 
surgical proced ure being performed over the globe of the eye.  
 
Adverse Events Pertaining to Cooling:  
Anticipated transient side effects associated with cooling may include tingling, itching, 
decreased sensation, numbness, redness and pain.  
 
Adverse Events Pertaining to Anesthetic:  
1% lidocaine (Lidocaine) with Epineph rine Injection  
Pain and numbness may be experienced at the site of the injection. Redness, rash, 
infection, skin damage or nerve damage at the site of the injection may also be 
experienced. Temporary loss of sensation and muscle function at the site of injection may 
be experienced. Lidocaine with epinephrine contains the preservative sodium metabisulfite 
which may cause allergic -type reactions or intolerances including anaphylactic symptoms 
such as itching, hives, swollen areas of the body, and/or troubl e breathing and life -

threatening or less severe asthmatic episodes in certain susceptible people.  
 
Adverse Events Pertaining to Nitronox : 
May experience nausea, vomiting, excessive sweating, euphoria, excitement, deep 
sedation, drowsiness, sleep, dizziness, lightheadedness, dysphoria, amnesia, and 
headaches.  
 
Adverse Events Pertaining to Ultrasound:  
Ultrasound imaging has minimal risks and may produce effects on the body such as 
redness and pockets of gas.  Skin rashes from use of the ultrasound ge l may also occur.  
 
 Other Anticipated Adverse Events:  
Incomplete response  or no response  is relatively common since some subjects may not 
respond to treatment.  
 
5.0 PREGNANCY  
Females may not participate in this study if they are pregnant, breastfeeding, were pregnant 
within the last three months or are planning a pregnancy during the course of the study.   
 
If the subject thinks they have become pregnant during the study it is important that they inform 
the Investigator immediately. If she becomes pregnant or thinks that she may be pregnant, she 
will be removed from the study and will be asked to perform a final evaluation  similar to that of the 
final follow -up visit .  The Investigator may request to track the pregnancy and will report the 
pregnancy to the Sponsor.  
 
6.0 SUBJECT WITHDRAWAL  
The subject is free to withdraw from this study at any time.  The subject must inform the Investigator 
immediately if they intend to withdraw. To terminate the subject’s participation in this study, they 
must contact the Investigator at the contact information listed on page one of the informed consent 
form. They wi ll be asked to come to the study clinic or Investigators office to complete a final follow 
up visit and may be asked to perform end of study procedures .  Their decision to participate in this 
study or to withdraw from this study will not influence the availability of their future medical care and 
will involve no penalty or loss of benefits to which they are otherwise entitle d. 
 
The Investigator in charge of the study can remove the subject from this study without their consent 
for any reason, including,  but not limited to:  
a. His/her judgment that any condition or circumstance may jeopardize their welfare or the integrity 
of the study.  
b. Their failure to follow the instructions of the Investigator(s).  
c. If the study is stopped by the sponsor and/or Investigator s participating in the study prior to 
completion.  
 
7.0 PHOTOGRAPHY  
Standardized photographs may  be taken of the treatment area.  If photograph s are taken  of the 
face the subject will  be asked to remove jewelry, make  up and lotions  prior to each photo session.  
Photo graphs  will be taken with an appropriate high resolution digital camera. Camera settings 
(lighting, distance, background, polarization, etc.) will be reproduced at each visit, so that 
photo graphs  are suitab le for compari son.

8.0 RISK ANALYSIS AND MANAGEMENT  
The Investigator in this clinical trial has been invited to participate based on his/her previous 
experienc e with the use of  system , similar systems and industry experience . Experience with  
treatments is the most critical element in managing subject risk in this trial.  All other known risks 
will be disclosed to the subject via the informed consent process. Since this is an elective 
procedure and the subjects are volunteers, it can be assume d that their signature on the informed 
consent is indicative of their agreement to accept the risks involved.  
 
In addition, as with any study, there is a risk of bias. To minimize/avoid bias objective evaluation 
methods may also be used in conjunction with  subjective evaluation methods when feasible.  
 
9.0 ADVERSE REACTIONS  DEFINITIONS AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS  
All adverse events that occur, starting from the time of the first treatment , will be recorded in the 
source documents.  
Adverse Events occurring will be captured and followed until the co ndition resolves, stabilizes,  is 
otherwise explained, or the subject is lost to follow -up. Subjects will be instructed tha t they may 
contact the  Investigator at any time throug hout the course of the study . 
The Investigator and/or designated study staff will review each event and asse ss its relationship 
to the study device  (not related, unlikely, possible, probable, and highly probable). The following 
definitions will be used for rating relationship to the device  treatments:  
• Not related – The event is clearly related to other factors such as the subject’s clinical state, 
therapeutic interventions, or concomitant medications administered to the subject.  
• Unlikely – The event was most likely produced by other factors such as the subject’s clinical 
state, therapeutic interventions, or a concomitant medication administered to the subject; and 
does  not follow a known response pattern to the investigational product.  
• Possible – The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of 
investigational product administration; and/or  follows a known response pattern to the study 
sampling sessions; but could have been produced by other factors such as the subject’s 
clinical state, therapeutic interventions, or concomitant medications administered to the 
subject.  
• Probable – The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of 
investigational  product administration; and follows a known response pattern to the 
investigational product; and cannot be reasonably explained by other factors such as the 
subject’s clinical state, therapeutic interventions, or concomitant medications administered to 
the subject.  
• Highly Probable – The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of 
investigational product administration; and follows a known response pattern to the 
investigational product; and cannot be reasonably explained by other factors such as the 
subject’s clinical state, therapeutic interventions, or concomitant medications administered to 
the subject; and either occurs immediately following investigational product administration, or 
improves on stopping the investigational product, or reappears on repeat exposure, or there 
is a positive reaction at the application site.  
 
Each adverse event reported will be graded on a 3 -point severity.  Using t he following 
definitions for rating severity will be used:  
 
PROTOCOL #:  CYN17 -RF-CLINIC

Version 1 3: March 20 , 2019  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 19 of 25 
• Mild – easily tolerated, causing m inimal discomfort, and not interfering with normal everyday  
activities.  
• Moderate – sufficiently discomforting and may interfere with normal everyday activities.  
• Severe – incapacitating and/or preventing normal everyday activities.  
 
A Serious Adverse Event  (SAE) is any adverse device experience that results in any of the 
following outcomes:  death, a life -threatening adverse device experience, in -patient 
hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization, a persistent or significant disability/incapacity, 
or a congenital anomaly/birth defect. Important medical events that may or may not result in 
death, be life -threatening, or require hospitalization may be considered a serious adverse device 
experience when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject or 
subject may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this 
definition  
 
If any of the above adverse events are serious as defined by the FDA Code of Federal 
Regulations (CFR), Title 21, special procedures will be followed.  All serious adverse events will 
be reported within 24 hours of ackno wledgment to the Sponsor  whether or not the serious 
events are deemed sampling session -related.  All serious event reporting will adhere to 21  CFR 
part 812 and the IRB will be notified accordingly.  
   
The SAE information will be entered into the database and a desk copy of the complete SAE 
report will be submitted to the files.  
 
Adverse events, whet her serious or non -serious, will be followed until the condit ion is resolved, 
stabilized, otherwise explained  or the subject is lost to follow -up.  Adverse events will be 
captured throughout the study and where appropriate, medical tests and examinations w ill be 
performed to document the resolution of event(s). Outcomes may be classified as resolved, 
improved, uncha nged, worse, fatal, unknown or lost to follow -up.  Following the resolution of any 
study -associated adverse events there will be no further adve rse event reports for that subject.  
 
10.0 PROTOCOL DEVIATIONS  
All requests for protocol deviations by the Investigator have to be communicated to the sponsor

requirements, as well as t he possible risks involved with study participation.  
 
16.0 DATA ANALYSIS  
All data will be analyzed at the end of the study.  The primary analysis will be performed by the 
intent ion-to-treat approach.  All subjects who begin  the treatment is considered to be part of the 
study whether the subject  completes the study or not.  Additional per -protocol analysis may also 
be performed on subjects who complete the entire clinical trial according to the protocol.  The 
most appropriate method of handling missing valu es will be chosen based on the particular trial's 
goals, endpoints and context.  
 
Endpoints will be summarized with descriptive statistics.  Continuous variables will be 
summarized with n, mean, standard deviation and range.  Frequency counts and percentage  of 
subjects within each category will be presented for categorical data.  If applicable, Student’s t -
test may be used to determine if two sets of data are significantly different from each other and 
p-values will be reported.  If the calculated p -value is  below the threshold chosen for statistical 
significance (0.05, or 0.01 level) then the null hypothesis is rejected in favor of the alternative 
hypothesis.  Subgroup analyses may be performed to identify a subject  population that achieves 
the most benefit.   Interim results may also be collected an d reported as deemed necessary.  
 
17.0 REPORTING FOR THE STUDY

Amendment 6 08March 2021As the primary objective for the study  was 
met at the pre -specified interim anal ysis 
(Section 9.6 ), the frequency  of study  
procedures will be reduced while providing 
continued treatment for patients activel y 
receiving avelumab and study participation 
will be ended for all patients not actively  
receiving avelumab ( ie, Arm A patients in 
long-term follow -up and all Arm B patients 
who have not crossed over to receive 
avelumab). These changes will be 
implemented following a final overall 
survival (OS) update conducted after the 
target number of OS events has been reached
(see Section 9.1 ).  
Key changes implemented by  Amendment 6 
include:
A new Schedule of Activities (SoA) table 
and a new Re quired Laboratory  Tests 
table ( Table 7 ) were added.
Blinded independent central review 
(BICR) tumor assessments will no longer 
be performed.
Arm B patients who are eligible to 
crossover to avelumab plus best 
supportive care (BSC) as per Supplement 
1 will be permitted to do so until 60 day s 
after the final OS update or approval of 
Amendment 6, whichever is later. 
CRF data collection will be reduced to 
those items relating to study  drug 
exposure and adverse events.

Change Letters dated 03 Apr 2020 and 15 
Apr 2020, and updated according to the 
current protocol appendix template for
public health emergencies: Appendix 6
Alternative Measures During Public 
Emergencies was added in response to the 
ongoing global pandemic COVID- 19, and 
the increasing restrictions on travel, 
investigational site access issues and 
concerns on public health in order to 
clarify  alternative solutions that will

Amendment 5 13 February  2020At the pre -specified interim analy sis (Section 
9.6), this study  met the primary  objective and 
demonstrated that avelumab plus BSC 
significantl y prolongs OS compared to BSC 
alone in both co -primary  populations (ie, in 
all randomized patients a nd in patients with 
PD-L1-positive tumors) . 
Based on this result, the External- Data 
Monitoring Committee (E -DMC) 
recommended that remaining patients on

Final Protocol Amendment 6, 08 March 2021
PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL
Page 6Document Version Date Summary of Changes
Arm B who are progression- free be offered 
crossover to avelumab.   
The purpose of this protocol amendme nt is to 
implement the E -DMC recommendation.
1.The following sections were modified 
based on the above:
Protocol Summary  (Study  Design);
1.2.3.3 Rationale for Study  Design;
1.3 Summary  of Benefit Risk 
Assessment;
3.1 Study  Overview;
5.1 Allocation to Treatment.
2. Added Section 17, Supplement 1:

B patients who crossover to receive 
avelumab plus BSC including required 
eligibility  criteria, gener al treatment/study  
plan, and schedule of activities for 
screening, treatment period, end of 
treatment/withdrawal and short and long-
term follow -up.  
Amendment 4 28 March 20191.Given the lack of standardization, 
immune -related Response Criteria 
(irRECI ST)has been removed as an 
exploratory  endpoint and required stud y 
assessment.  Associated elements were 
revised or removed accordingl y in 
Section 3.1.2 and throughout the 
document as appropriate.  This includes:
The requirement for repeat tumor 
assessment to confirm progressive 
disease (PD) was removed.  
MSB0010718C
B9991001
Final Protocol Amendment 6, 08 March 2021
PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL
Page 7Document Version Date Summary of Changes
(Section 7.7 and throughout the 
document as appropriate).
Treatment after PD section was 
updated as a result of removing the 
requirement to confirm PD.  
(Section 5.4.1). 
2. Management of avelumab-related toxici ty 
has been updated to reflect current 
avelumab program standard 
recommendations (Section 5.4.3).  This 
includes:
Specific recommendations for 
avelumab- related toxicity  provided in 
Tables 3, 4 and 5 were updated.
Text in the management of avelumab
immune -related adverse events and 
hypersensitivity  reactions sections 
were removed, as the information 
provided is now covered in other 
sections. 
A 2-hour post -dose observation 
period is no longer required. 
Premedications to mitigate avelumab 
infusion-r elated reactions were 
revised such that premedication is 
only required for the first 4 infusions.  
(Section 5.4.3.1. and throughout the 
document as appropriate).
The avelumab infusion rate may  be 
returned to the baseline rate following 
a previous reduction due to an 
infusion- related reaction (Table 4).
3.Contraception requirements have been 
updated for females and males in 
accordance with the current Pfizer and 
avelumab program standards.  
MSB0010718C
B9991001
Final Protocol Amendment 6, 08 March 2021
PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL
Page 8Document Version Date Summary of Changes
(Section 4.3.1 and throughout the 
document as appropriate).
4.The contra ception check and pregnancy  
test were removed as required study  
procedures at the 60 Day Follow- up visit, 
in accordance with the current avelumab 
program standard.  (Section 7.1.1 and 
throughout the document as appropriate).
5.It has been added that if new c ancer 
therap y is started, reporting of 
concomitant medications should end at 
the time the new cancer therap y starts in 
order to match the AE reporting period, 
and in accordance with the current 
avelumab program standard.  (Section 5.9 
and throughout the do cument as 
appropriate).
6.The section for rational for 
immunotherapy  treatments in 
maintenance of UC was updated to 
include recently  published results from a 
pooled anal ysis of study EMR 100070 -
001.  (Section 1.2.3.2).
7.Survival assessments for long -term 
follow-up (every  3 months) were clarified 
to begin after the last study  clinic visit, 
and to allow additional timepoints at 
Sponsor request in preparation for interim 
and final anal yses in order to update 
survival information and add uniformity  
in the time sin ce most recent contact.  
(Footnotes in SOA table).
8.Clarifications have been made as follows:
The frequency  of bone imaging 
requirements was clarified to be every  
16 weeks for the first year after 
randomization and every  24 weeks 
thereafter (ie, at every  other tumor 
assessment).  (Section 7.7 and 
MSB0010718C
B9991001
Final Protocol Amendment 6, 08 March 2021
PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL
Page 9Document Version Date Summary of Changes
throughout the document as 
appropriate).
Text was added to clarify that 
intranasal, inhaled, and topical 
steroids; local steroid injections; and 
all inactive vaccines are permitted.  
(Section 5.9.3 and throughout th e 
document as appropriate).
The list of required lab tests was 
updated to clarify  that glucose testing 
can be done in a fasted or non- fasted 
status.  (Section 7.1.3).
Clarification was added that the 
archival tumor tissue sample is not 
mandatory , in consis tency  with other 
sections of the protocol.  (SOA table 
and throughout the document as 
appropriate).
A window of ±3 day s was specified 
for the radiological tumor 
assessments to provide clarity  for 
scheduling purposes.  (Footnotes in 
SOA tables).
The reporti ng of AEs and recording 
of concomitant medications was 
clarified for Arm B to end 90 day s 
after the End of Treatment (EOT) 
visit, instead of 90 day s after the last 
dose of study  drug.  ( SOA tables and 
throughout the document as 
appropriate).
9.Additional min or edits were made 
throughout the document for clarit y and 
consistency .
Amendment 3 19 December 20161.Removed a footnote stating “avelumab is 
the proposed International 
Nonproprietary  Name (INN)…” as this 
MSB0010718C
B9991001
Final Protocol Amendment 6, 08 March 2021
PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL
Page 10Document Version Date Summary of Changes
has been endorsed b y the governing 
authorities (Cover Page, Protocol 
Summary , and Section 1.1). 
2.Following the accelerated approval of 
atezolizumab by  the United States FDA, a 
sentence stat ing “there are no second -line 
therapies approved in the United States” 
was deleted (Protocol Summary  and 
Section 1.2.3.1).
3.To mitigate the potential for bias in 
determining disease progression, an 
expedited blinded independent central 
review (BICR) for inv estigator- assessed 
disease progression was added 
(Section 7.8 and throughout text as 
appropriate).  
4.For patient convenience and to optimize 
trial logistics, revised text to allow 
patients to provide informed consent 
during or after first -line chemotherap y
(Protocol Summary , Schedule of 
Activities for Screening footnote 2, and 
Section 3.1).
5.To optimize trial logistics, removed the 
requirement for central eligibility  review 
of first -line chemotherapy  response 
(Protocol Summary ; Schedule of 
Activities for Scr eening footnotes 16 and 
21; Section 3.1; Section 4.1 inclusion 
criterion 3.a; and Section 7.7).
6. Clarified that the ‘FACT Bladder 
Symptom Index (FBlSI)’ is the 
‘NCCN -FACT FBlSI -18’.  This change is 
indicated in Section 3.1.4 and throughout 
text where appropriate.
7.For patient/investigator convenience, 
added a note allowing that laboratory  
tests may  be performed up to 3 day s prior 
to the scheduled clinic visit so that results 
will be available for review (Schedule of 
MSB0010718C
B9991001
Final Protocol Amendment 6, 08 March 2021
PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL
Page 11Document Version Date Summary of Changes
Activities for Study Treatment Period 
footnote 1 and Follow -up Period 
footnote 1).
8.Per United States FDA request, to assess 
the utility  of serum troponin 
measurements in earl y detection of 
myocarditis, a rare and potentially  fatal 
risk associated with avelumab and other 
check -point inhibitors, the following 
additions were made to both study  arms:
Mandatory  measurement of cardiac 
troponin levels at screening and at 
each clinic visit ending on Cy cle4 
Day 1 (ie, for a total of 12 weeks), 
and as clinicall y indicated (Schedule 
of Assessments for Stud y Treatment 
footnote 12, and Table 6).
Management guidelines for 
myocarditis (Table 5).
Further information and rationale for 
this addition in Section 1.2.2.1.
9.To adequatel y monitor for disease 
progression, clarified that chest, 
abdomen, and pelvic CT or MRI  scans 
are required at each tumor assessment 
time point and for all patients (Schedule 
of Activities for Study  Treatment Period 
footnote 16 and Follow -up Period 
footnote 13; and Sections 3.1.2 and 7.7).
10.Revised the requirement for a screening 
bone scan (or 18FDG -PET scan) to allow 
alternate modalities (eg, MRI ) per local 
standard of care, as 18FDG -PET scan is 
not a permissible alternate for bone 
imaging at some centers and MRI  in 
some countries is the preferred method 
for bone imaging instead of bone scans 
(Schedule of Activities for Study  
Treatment Period footnote 16 and 
MSB0010718C
B9991001
Final Protocol Amendment 6, 08 March 2021
PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL
Page 12Document Version Date Summary of Changes
Follow -up Period footnote 13; and 
Sections 3.1.2 and 7.7).   
11.As asy mptomatic brain metastases are 
infrequent in the stud y population, the 
requirement for a screening brain scan 
was changed to appl y only to patients 
with a history  of brain metastases or for 
whom brain metastases are suspected 
(Schedule of Activities for Study  
Treatment Period footnote 16 and 
Follow -up Period footnote 13; and 
Sections 3.1.2 and 7.7). 
12.Per the current standard for the avelumab 
program, extended the adverse event 
(AE) collection period for all AEs 
regardless of causality to 90 calendar 
days (rather than 30 day s) after the last 
administration of study  drug (Schedule of 
Activities for Study Treatment Period 
footnot e 17 and Follow -up Period 
footnote 14; and Section 8.2).
13. Clarified and modified requirements 
relating to the collection of tumor tissue 
biospecimens (Schedule of Activities for 
Study  Treatment Period footnotes 24 and 
25; Schedule of Activities for Follow-u p 
Period footnote 19; inclusion criterion 4; 
and Section 6.1.1).
Permitted the submission of freshl y 
cut slides in place of tissue blocks for 
the recent tumor tissue sample and the 
End of Treatment biopsy , as some 
investigative centers are not able to 
subm it tissue blocks due to local 
policy  or regulations.
To facilitate patient enrollment, 
allowed that the recent tumor tissue 
sample may have been obtained 
MSB0010718C
B9991001
Final Protocol Amendment 6, 08 March 2021
PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL
Page 13Document Version Date Summary of Changes
within 24 months prior to 
randomization (instead of 1 y ear).
Added that tumor tissue samples 
obtained from bone metastases are not 
acceptable, as the processing required 
for these samples (decalcification) is 
not compatible with planned anal yses.
Clarified the time point for the 
archival tumor tissue sample collected 
at the time of the primary diagnosis or
first tumor resection (if different from 
the most recent tumor tissue sample), 
and removed the availability  of this 
sample as an eligibility  requirement to 
facilitate patient enrollment.
14.Removed ECOG performance status as a 
survival follow- up procedure as this data 
is not required for survival anal yses and 
is difficult to reliably  collect during 
long-term follow -up (Schedule of 
Activities for Follow -up Period footnote 
3). 
15.Clarified and modified eligibility  criteria 
(Section 4.1 and Section 4.2) to ensure 
protocol compliance and facilitate patient 
enrollment:
Clarified eligible tumor stage listed in 
inclusion criterion 1b and added 
reference to TNM tumor classification 
(Section 16).
Clarified that first -line chemotherap y 
must have been completed no less 
than 4 weeks and no more than 
10weeks prior to randomization 
(inclusion criterion 2a).
MSB0010718C
B9991001
Final Protocol Amendment 6, 08 March 2021
PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL
Page 14Document Version Date Summary of Changes
Revised inclusion criterion 4 relating 
to tumor sample requirements (as 
described above).
Revised inclusion criterion 11 to 
allow alternate methods for 
estimating creatinine clearance.
Added a higher eligibility limit for 
AST and ALT elevations in patients 
with liver metastases consistent with 
updated inclusion criteria across 
avelumab program.
Clarified exclusion criterion 2 as 
being applicable to s ystemic 
treatments.
Added exceptions for persisting 
toxicity  related to prior therapy  to 
exclusion criterion 6.
Added exception for patients with 
resected prostate cancer to exclusion 
criterion 7.
Revised exclusion criterion 10 
relating to prior cardiovascular 
disease to facilitate patient enrollment 
and to match the current standard 
template for avelumab protocols.
Revised exclusion criterion 17 
relating to hepatitis B or C for clarit y 
and to match the current standard 
template for avelumab protocols.
16. Removed a 120 minute maximum limit 
on the total duration of avelumab 
infusions as this limit is unnecessary  
(Protocol Summary, Section 3.1.1, 
Section 5.4.3.2, and Table 4).
MSB0010718C
B9991001
Final Protocol Amendment 6, 08 March 2021
PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL
Page 15Document Version Date Summary of Changes
17.Removed requirement for testing urine 
albumin levels (Table 6) as this is not 
standardl y available (eg, in routinely  used 
urine test strips) and is not required as a 
safet y assessment.
18.Removed measurement of avelumab 
metabolite(s) as this is not a planned 
pharmacokinetic anal ysis (Section 7.3).
19.Modified anal ysis of disease control 
(Section 9.3.2) as follows:
Added non -CR/non -PD as a response 
category  since patients without 
measurable disease per RECI ST v1.1 
are eligible for study  participation.   
Noted that CR and PR must be 
confirmed b y a repeat assessment, and 
that the criterion for SD must have 
been met at least 6 weeks after the 
date of randomization. 
Removed an anal ysis of the disease 
control rate at 24 weeks as this is best 
assessed based on Kaplan -Meier 
methodology  for estimation of 
progression- free survival rates.
20.In Appendix 3, revised “index” lesi ons to 
be “target” lesions for consistency .
21.In Appendix 8, added abbreviations for 
EuroQol 5 dimension 5 level 
questionnaire (EQ -5D- 5L) and cardiac 
troponin, and corrected the abbreviation 
for single reference safety document 
(SRSD). 
22.Minor edits for clari ty were made where 
appropriate throughout text.
Amendment 2 24 March 2016 Per Voluntary  Harmonisation Procedure

1.Added an HIV screening test unless not 
permitted by  local laws and regulations 
(Schedule of Activities table and footnote 
#12; and Table 6, Section 7.1.3) and 
exclusion of HI V positive patients 
(exclusion criterion #16, Section 4.2). 
2. Clarified that exclusion criterion #21 
(Section 4.2) includes but is not limited to 
those medical conditions listed, and add 
‘pulmonary  fibrosis’ as a listed condition.
3.Clarified in Section 7.1.3 that the 
requirement to repeat abnormal 
laboratory  test results applies only  for 
clinically  significant abnormal results.
4.Clarified in Section 9.6 the stopping rules 
for efficacy  and futility .  
Amendment 1 17 December 20151. Per FDA request, implemented 
clarifications in Section 5.4.3.5, Table 5 
Management of Avelumab I mmune -
Related Adverse Events (irAEs):
Clarified requirement for delay ing or 
discontinuing avelumab for Grade 3 
or 4 dermatological irAEs.
Clarified requirement to delay  or 
discontinue avelumab therap y for 
suspicion of adrenal crisis. 
2. Per FDA request, added a requirement in 
Section 5.4.3.5, Table 5, to permanentl y 
discontinue avelumab therap y for patients 
with AST/AL T >3 x ULN with 
concurrent elevation of total bilirubin >2 
x ULN without another obvious cause.
3. Revised Table 3 (Section 5 .4.3) to 
remove redundant items.
4.Section 4.1, inclusion criterion #11 was 
revised to allow enrollment of patients 
with a creatinine clearance (CrCl) 
MSB0010718C

Final Protocol Amendment 6, 08 March 2021
PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL
Page 17Document Version Date Summary of Changes
≥30mL/min (changed from ≥50 
mL/min).
Patients with a CrCl of <60 mL /min 
are considered to be candidates fo r 
first-line gemcitabine+carboplatin 
chemotherap y.  A proportion of these 
patients would be commonly  
excluded by  a ≥50 mL/min CrCl 
requirement.  Also, patients who 
initially  have a value of >50 could 
drop to below 50 after completion of 
platinum based first- line treatment.  
This lower (but still ≥30 mL /min) 
permissible inclusion value is 
anticipated to be safe based on the 
low incidence of renal toxicity  
observed in the avelumab studies to-
date.
5.Correction of minor errors and internal 
inconsistencies.
6.Figur e 1 (stud y schema) was corrected to 
remove reference to Blinded Independent 
Central Review (BICR).  
Patient withdrawal due to disease 
progression will be based on the 
investigator’s tumor response 
assessment, rather than BICR.
7.Section 9.3.2 was corrected to reflect that 
worsening of s ymptoms in the 
FBlSI -DRS -P subscale is measured as a 
decreased score (not an increase).  In 
addition, the formal comparison of the 
Time to Deterioration endpoint between 
the two treatment arms for each of the 
co-primary  popula tions was deleted so as 
not to inflate the overall ty pe I error in the 
study . 
8.Section 9.6 I nterim Analy sis was 
corrected to reflect that the timing of the

Page 19PROTOCOL SUMMARY
Background and Rationale :
Urothelial cancer (UC) includes tumors originating from the urothelial cells lining the 
bladder, renal pelvis, ureter, and urethra.1  Bladder cancer alone accounts for 90% of UC,1
and is the ninth most prevalent can cer worldwide, with approximately  400,000 new cases 
diagnosed and 150,000 deaths attributed to this disease each year.2  UC occurs more 
frequentl y in developed cou ntries; in Europe it is the eighth most common cause of mortality  
due to cancer, and in the United States, it also occurs at a very  high annual incidence rate 
(20.5 per 100,000 persons).3,4  The incidence and mortality  of bladder cancer have remained 
unchanged over the last 25 y ears.2
Combination chemotherapy  with platinum -based regimens is the standard of care for locall y 
advanced or metastatic bladder cancer.  Despite the favorable response and survival rates 
associated with the combination of methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin, and cisplatin 
(MVAC),10,11,12toxicities associated with this regimen can be significant and lead to death in 
3-4% of patients.12,13  Subsequently , the combinations of gemcitabine + cisplatin and 
gemcitabine + carboplatin were s hown to have comparable efficacy  and an improved safet y 
compared to MVAC,14,15,16with the latter combination used in the 30 -50% of patients 
ineligible for cisplatin-based chemotherap y due to renal impairment.17  As such, these two 
regimens are now the preferred regimens for the initial treatment of patients with locally  
advanced or metastatic UC.
Durable and complete responses following first -line chemotherapy  in patients with advanced 
UC are uncommon.  Complicated treatment regimens and severe side effects limit long -term 
use of these agents and most patients will ultimately  experience disease progression within 
9months after initial response .14  Optimal treatment in the second -line treatment setting still 
needs to be determined.27  Single and combination agents evaluated in this treatment setting 
have been associated with low median progression- free survival (PFS, 1.5 -3.0 months) and 
overall survival (OS, 4.6. -6.9 months), and are also associated with significant 
toxicities.28,29,30
In 2009, vinflunine was approved in Europe for the second -line treatment of UC after failure 
of first -line platinum -based therap y.28,31
The current “watch -and-wait” approach for the management of metastatic UC following 
response to first -line chemotherapy  prior to initiation of second -line t reatment has not proven 
to be effective because almost all patients eventually  relapse.  A multicenter Phase 2 study  of 
sunitinib as maintenance therap y in patients with advanced UC was recently reported.32  
Although the stud y terminated prematurel y due to low patient recruitment, it provided a 
different perspective on the treatment of this disease (ie, maintenance therapy  following 
response to first -line chemotherapy  in an attempt to improve the durability  of the initial 
response).  Recentl y, Powles et al reported the results of a Phase 2/3 study of lapatinib as 
maintenance treatment after first -line chemotherapy  in patients with HER1/HER2 -positive 
UC.33  The median PFS, median OS, and objective response rate (ORR) for patients 
receiving lapatinib (n = 116) vs. placebo (n = 116) were 4.6 months (95% confidence interval

(HR 0.98 [95% CI : 0.71 –1.35] p =0.89); and 13.8% vs. 7.8%, respectively  (p = 0.14).  In 
addition, a study  evaluating vinflunine34,35as a maintenance UC treatment is currentl y 
ongoing.
There is a strong rationale for considering immunotherap y in patients with advanced UC.  
Urologists led the way  in the use of immunotherapy  in cancer in 1976, having introduced the 
tuberculosis vaccine bacille Calmette- Guérin (BCG), which stimulates a robu st immune 
response in most patients and has become the standard of care as locoregional therap y after 
surgical resection of non -muscle -invasive disease.36,37  Multiple immunotherapies including 
interferon (IFN) -α, interleukin (IL) -2, IL -12, and IL -10 have been investigated, either as 
adjuncts w ith BCG or as a solo replacement therapy .38,39  Over the past 40 years, progress 
evaluating immunotherapy  for bladder cancer has been slow.  Subsequently , the programmed 
cell death- 1 (PD -1) / programmed death ligand 1 (PD -L1) pathway  has emerged as an 
important biological pathway  in UC.40,41,42  PD-1, an immunoinhibitory  receptor of the CD28 
family , play s an important role in tumor immune escape.43,44  The PD -1/PD -L1interaction 
inhibits T -lymphocy te activation, proliferation, survival and effector functions during 
anti-cancer immune response.  Several tumors, including UC, present with high rates of 
somatic mutations,45,46,47possibly  enhancing the host immune sy stem’s ability  to recognize 
tumor cells as foreign owing to an increased number of antigens and stimulate T -cell 
response.48  However, these cancers may  also elude immune surveillance and eradication 
through the expression of PD- L1 in the tumor microenvironment,49which then becomes an 
important target for anti- PD-L1 antibodies.  Indeed, antibodies blocking PD -1 and PD- L1 
have demonstrated significant and durable response in patients with advanced UC.  In a 
Phase 1b study  of anti -PD- 1 mAb pembrolizumab in heavily  pre-treated patients with 
advanced UC,40the ORR was 24% (10% complete response [CR] rate) among 33 treated 
patients with median follow -up duration of 11 months (range 10 -13).  The responses 
observed were durable, ranging from 16 to 40+ weeks (median not reached), with several 
responses ongoing at the time of anal ysis.
Similarly , an anti -PD-L1 mAb, MPDL -3280A, recentl y demonstrated significant durable 
response in heavily  pre-treated patients with UC .41,42  Preliminary  data presented at the 
American Societ y of Clinical Oncology  (ASCO) 2014 Annual Meeting from a Phase 1 study  
of MPDL 3280A as second -line treatment of patients with UC demonstrated noteworthy  
activity  in 20 evaluable patients with an ORR of 50%, including 1 CR and 9 partial responses 
(PRs).41  Durable responses were also demonstrated with this agent in heavily pre -treated 
patients with advanced stage UC,41,42with an ORR of 54% in 68 patients with 
PD-L1-positive tumors, with durable ongoing responses up to 30.3 weeks r eported.41  
Updated data from these studies with MPDL -3280A and pembrolizumab in patients with 
recurrent or metastatic PD- L1-positive UC further ind icated durable responses with 
promising PFS and OS in patients with PD- L1-positive tumors, local immune/inflammatory  
cells, or stroma.  Among 85 patients (46 PD-L1 immunohistochemistry  [IHC] 2/3 and 
38IHC 0/1) with UC who received MPDL -3280A, the ORR for PD-L1 IHC 2+/3+ UC 
patients was 46% (95% CI : 31-61%; 6 CRs, 15 PRs) and IHC 0/1+ UC patients was 
16% (95% CI 6 -31%; 6 PRs); median response durations not reached (IHC 2/3 0+ to 54+

(95% CI 12 -NE) and for IHC 0/1+ UC patients was 8 weeks (95% CI 6 -12).50  Among 
33patients enrolled with 1% PD -L1-positive cells in tumo r nests or a PD -L1-positive band 
in stroma by  IHC to receive pembrolizumab, 28 had measurable disease at baseline.  In these 
evaluable patients, the ORR was 25% (95% CI: 11-45), with 3 (11%) CR and 4 (14%) PR, 
with durations ranging from 16 to 50+ weeks (m edian not reached at time of anal ysis).51  
Avelumab (MSB0010718C), a potent and highly  selective full y human mAb of the 
immunoglobulin (Ig) G1 isoty pe, targets and binds PD -L1, the ligand for PD -1 and B7.1, 
thereb y blocking the interaction between PD -L1 and PD -1 and B7.1, removing the 
suppressive effects of PD -L1 on anti -tumor CD8+ T cells and resulting in restoration of the 
cytotoxic T -cell respons e.19
In the Phase 1 stud y EMR 100070-001, 53 patients have been treated with avelumab doses of 
1.0, 3.0, 10.0, and 20.0 mg/kg administered intraven ous (IV) Q2W in the dose escalation 
phase.  The 10 mg/kg dose level was selected for further study  and a summary  of pooled 
safet y data from 1738 patients treated at this dose level in studies EMR 100070 -001 and 
EMR 100070- 003 (N=1738) is available with a d ata cutoff date of 09 June 2016.19  The most 
frequentl y reported (incidence >5%) treatment- related adverse events were fatigue (17.7%), 
infusion- related reaction (17.0%), nausea (8.6%), diarrhea (7.1%), chills (6.7%), p yrexia 
(6.1%), decreased appetite (5.2%), and h ypoth yroidism (5.0%). 
Updated data from a pooled anal ysis of 249 patients enrolled in two advanced UC expansion 
cohorts in study  EMR 100070 -001 was recentl y published.75  Patients were included 
regardless of PD -L1 expression levels. The median age was 68 years and 124 (50%) patients 
received 2 or more prior treatments for advanced or metastatic disease.  At the time of the 
analysis (09 June 2016 data cut -off), the median fol low-up was 9.9 months (range 
4.3-12.1 months) and 60 (24%) patients were still on treatment.  Among 161 post -platinum 
treated patients with at least 6 months of follow- up, the ORR was 17% (95% CI : 11-24%), 
including 9 CRs and 18 PRs.  The disease control r ate (DCR) was 40%, including 37 patients 
who had SD as their best response.  An anal ysis using a cut -off of  5% for the expression of 
PD-L1 on tumor cells in 139 evaluable patients showed a 24% (15/63) ORR in the PD -L1 
positive population and 13% (10/76) i n the PD -L1 negative population, supporting that 
avelumab has anti -tumor activity  in both the PD -L1 positive and negative populations.  The 
median PFS was 11.9 weeks (95% CI: 6.1- 18.0 weeks) and 6.1 weeks (95% CI : 5.9-8.0 
weeks) in the PD -L1 positive and n egative populations, respectivel y.  The median OS was 
8.2months (95% CI: 5.7- 13.7 months) and 6.2 months (95% CI : 4.3-14.0 months) in patients 
with PD -L1 positive and negative tumors, respectively .
These data support further evaluation of avelumab for the treatment of patients with 
advanced stage UC.  Given the poor prognosis for patients with advanced UC whose disease 
progresses after first -line chemotherap y, where patient outcomes are ultimately  very  
poor,30,53,75a maintenance treatment with avelumab after first -line platinum -based 
chemotherap y may provide additional clinical benefit compared to the current 
watch -and-wait standard of care after chemotherapy .  The safet y and efficacy  of avelumab

Study Treatment :
For the purpose of this study , “stud y treatment” refers to both the investigational 
product (avelumab) plus BSC and BSC alone administered to patients during 
participation in this study .  
Study  treatments may  continue until confirmed disease progression as assessed by  
BICR, patient refusal, patient lost to follow up, unacceptable toxicity , or the study  is 
terminated by the sponsor, whichever comes first (see Section 6.5Patient 
Withdrawal).  
According to the opinion of an investigator, if a patient in Arm A is still experiencing 
clinical benefit at the time of confirmed disease progression, the patient will be 
eligible for continued treatment with avelumab plus BSC, provided the treating 
physician has determined that the benefit/risk for doing so is favorable (see 
Section 5.4.1 Treatment after Initial Evid ence of Radiologic Disease Progression).  
Radiological tumor assessments will be continued in these patients as described in the 
Section 3.1.2 , Tumor Assessments. 
If a patient starts a new anti -cancer therap y before d ocumented disease progression, 
then tumor assessments should be continued per the Schedule of Activities (unless not 
feasible) until documentation of disease progression or death, whichever occurs first.
After review of radiolo gic images b y BICR is stopped as per Protocol Amendment 6,

Patients randomized to BSC alone (Arm B) will be cared for as deemed appropriate 
by the treating phy sician.  This could include treatment with antibiotics, nutritional 
support, correction of metabolic disorders, optimal sy mptom control and pain 
management (including palliative radiotherap y), etc.  BSC does not include any

Statistical Methods :
The primary  objective of this study  is to demonstrate the benefit of maintenance treatment 
with avelumab plus BSC vs. BSC alone in prolonging OS in patients with un resectable 
locally  advanced or metastatic UC whose disease did not progress on or following 
completion of first -line platinum- containing chemotherap y in each co -primary  UC patient 
populations: 1) patients determined to have PD -L1-positive tumors (including infiltrating 
immune cells) by  a verified GMP PD -L1 IHC test, and 2) all randomized patients. 
The study  will randomize a total of approximately  668 patients, with at least 334 patients 
with confirmed PD -L1-positive tumors, using 1:1 randomization, stratif ied by  best response 
to chemotherap y (CR/PR vs. SD) and site of metastasis (visceral vs. non -visceral) at time of 
initiating first -line chemotherap y. 
The sample size for this study  is determined based on the following assumptions: 
For all patients and pa tients with PD -L1-positive tumors receiving BSC alone after 
first-line chemotherap y, the median OS is 12 months.33
For all patients receiving avelum ab plus BSC after first -line chemotherap y, the 
median OS is assumed to be 17.1 months.
For patients with PD -L1-positive tumors receiving avelumab plus BSC after first- line 
chemotherap y, the median OS is assumed to be 18.5 months.
This corresponds to a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.7 for all patients and 0.65 for patients with 
PD-L1-positive tumors under the exponential model assumption. 
For all patients, if the true HR is 0.7 under the alternative h ypothesis, a total of 425 OS 
events will be required to have 93% power to detect a HR of 0.7 using a one -sided log rank 
test at a significance level of 0.015 and a 2 -look group -sequential design with L an-DeMets 
(O’Brien -Fleming)71-spending function to determine the efficacy  boundary  and a Gamma 
Family  (-8) -spending function to determine the non- binding futility  boundary . 
For patients with PD -L1 positive tumors, if the true HR is 0.65 under the alternative 
hypothesis, then a total of 219 OS events will be required to have 80% power to detect a HR 
of 0.65 using a one -sided log rank test at a significance level of 0.01 and a 2 -look group 
sequential design with Lan -DeM ets (O’Brien -Fleming)71-spending function to determine

PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL
Page 28the efficacy  boundary  and a Gamma Family  (-8) -spending function to determine the 
non-binding futility  boundary .
The sample size further assumes a 5% drop -out rate for OS on either treatment arm, a 
non-uniform patient accrual accomplished over a 28- month period, and follow -up for about 
11months after the last patient is randomized.  The data cutoff for the primary  OS anal ysis 
will occur after the target number of events has been reached in both co -primary  populations 
and the last patient randomized in the study  has been followed for at least 12 months after 
randomization.
The study  will be con sidered positive if the stratified log- rank test for OS is significant at the 
respective levels specified above at the time of the final anal ysis for either of the two 
co-primary  populations.

Page 313.Medical/Oncological History: To include information on prior adjuvant or neoadjuvant treatments, surgery, and radiation therapy.   Information for the 
first-line chemotherapy regimen for advanced/metastatic disease will include planned doses, actual doses, and dates of administrati on.  All sites of 
disease prior to first -line chemotherapy must also be documented.
4.Baseline Signs/Sym ptoms: To be recorded on Cycle 1 Day 1.  Patients w ill be asked about any signs and symptoms experienced w ithin the 14 days prior 
to randomization.
5.Physical Exa mination: Includes an examination of major body systems (height included at screening only).  
6.Vital Signs and Weight: Vital signs to include blood pressure and pulse rate, which should be taken prior to study drug dosing (if applicable) and w ith 
the patient in the seated position after the patient has been sitting quietly for at least 5 minutes.  
Weight should be measured at each visit as indicated.  For Arm A patients, w eight should be measured within 3 days prior to each dose of avelumab (for 
determination of the avelumab dose [mg]).
7.Contraception Check: Female patients who are of childbearing potential will need to affirm that they meet the criteria for correct use of the selected 
methods of contraception.  The investigator or his or her designee will discuss with the patient the need to use the selected contraception methods 
consistently and correctly and document such conversations in the patient’s chart.  In addition, the investigator or his or her designee will i nstruct the 
patient to call immediately if the selected contraception methods are discontinued, or if pregnancy is known or suspect ed in the patient or the male 
patient’s partner.  After randomization, contraception checks will be performed only for Arm A patients.   See Section 4.3.1 .
8.Coagulation, Hem atology, and Blood Chemistry (full panel) : Required tests are listed in Table 6.  Full chemistry panel is required at Screening, 
Cycle1 Day 1, Cycle 1 Day 15 (Arm A patients), Cycle 2 Day 1, Cycle 3 Day 1, and Day 1 of every 2 cycles (8 weeks) thereafter.  Ma y also be 
performed when clinically indicated.  If full and core chemistry pan els are scheduled at the same visit, only the full chemistry will be performed.  
9.Blood Chem istry (core panel) : Core chemistry panel (required tests are listed in Table 6) is required at each clinic visit at which a full chemistry panel 
is not required. 
10.Thyroid Function and ACTH Tests: Free T4, TSH, and ACTH tests will be performed at screening, Cycle 3 Day 1, and Day 1 of every 2 cycles 
(8weeks) thereafter.  Additio nal tests should be performed when clinically indicated.  See Table 6.
11.Serum/Urine Pregnancy Test: For female patients of childbearing potential, a serum pregnancy test, with sensitivity of at least 25 mIU/mL, will be 
performed on two occasions prior to starting study treatment: once at the start of screening and once at the Cycle 1 Day 1 vi sit for Arm A patients 
immediately before study treatment administration.  Ad ditional pregnancy tests (serum or urine) will also be routinely repeated for Arm A patients prior 
to each avelumab dose during the active treatment period, at the End of Treatment/Withdrawal visit, and additionally whenever one menstrual cycle is 
missed o r when potential pregnancy is otherwise suspected.  Additional pregnancy tests may also be undertaken if requested by Institu tional Review 
Board (IRB)/Ethics Committees (ECs) or if required by local regulations.  Results of the pregnancy test should be ava ilable prior to each dosing.  After 
randomization, pregnancy tests will be performed only for Arm A patients.  See Section 7.1.1 .
12.Cardiac Troponin (cTn): Measurement of cTnT is preferred; how ever, cTnI may be substituted where cTnT is not available at the local laboratory.  The 
same subunit (cTnT or cTnI) measured during screening should be measured consistently throu ghout the study for any given patient.  During screening, 
clinically significant positive results should be further assessed as per local standard of care to rule out concurrent cardi ac conditions which could make the 
patient ineligible for the study per t he exclusion criteria.  During the study, clinically significant ne w elevations suggestive of myocarditis should be 
assessed as per Table5.  Additional tests should a lso be performed when clinically indicated.  See Table 6.
13.HIV test: HIV serology test is required at screening unless not permitted by local laws and regulations.  If i ndicated, supplemental testing may be 
performed per standard practice to confirm an HIV infection.
14.Urinalysis : Required only at Screening and End of Treatment.  To be performed as clinically indicated at other time points.  Required t ests are listed in
Table 6.

Page 3215. 12 -Lead Electrocardiogram  (ECG): All patients require a single ECG measurement at screening.  Additional ECGs may be performed as clinically 
indicated.  Clinically significant ne w findings seen on follow -up ECGs should be recorded as adverse events.
16.Tumor Assessments: Tum or assessments will include all known or suspected disease sites.  Imaging will include chest, abdomen, and pelvis compute d 
tomography ( CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans.  Bone imaging, eg, bone scans or other methods considered standard of care loc ally, such as 
18-Fluorodeoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography (18FDG -PET) or MRI, are required at baseline.  ( Note : 18FDG -PET m ay not be a permissible 
alternate for bone imaging at some centers or countries (eg, investigative sites in Canada)).  Bone lesion(s) identified at b aseline by bone scan will be 
further assessed by CT or MRI as per local practice (where bone scans are not u sed as a routine restaging tool) and subsequently re- assessed by CT or MRI 
as per the tumor assessment schedule as an alternative to bone scans.  Bone imaging will only be repeated during study as cli nically indicated (eg, patient 
describes new or w orsenin g bone pain, or has increasing alkaline phosphatase level, or other signs and symptoms of ne w/progressing bone metastases), a t 
the time of complete response (CR) confirmation, and at every other tumor assessment visit (ie, every 16 w eeks for the first year after randomization and 
every 24 w eeks thereafter) if considered local standard of care.  
Brain imaging (eg , MRI) is required at baseline for patients who have a history of brain metastases or for whom brain metastases are suspected during 
screening.  Brain must be included in subsequent tumor assessments if a patient has brain metastases at baseline; otherwise brain will only be evaluated 
when clinically indicated. 
The CT and MRI scans should be performed with contrast agents unless contraindicated for medical reasons.  The same imaging t echnique used to 
characterize each identified and reported lesion at baseline will be employed in the following tumor assessments.  All radiographic images from the time 
of the most recent tumor assessment prior to first- line chemotherapy until documented disease progression will be submitted to an independent third -
party core imaging laboratory for Blinded Independent Central Revie w (BICR) as described in the Study Manual.  
For all patients, anti -tumor activity will be assessed through radiological tumor assessments conducted at baseline (including chest, abdomen, and p elvic 
CT or MRI scans), at 8 weeks after randomization, then every 8 (±3 days) weeks for up to 1 year from randomization, and every 12 w eeks (±3 days) 
thereafter until documented disease progression as assessed by BICR regardless of initiation of subsequent anti -cancer therapy.  Additional radiological 
tumor assessments should also be conducted whenever disease progression is suspected (eg, symptomatic deterioration).   
Assessment of response will be made using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v.1.1 ( Appendix 2).  Complete response ( CR) and 
partial response (PR) must be confirmed with repeated imaging performed at least 4 weeks after initial documentatio n of response.  See Section 7.7for 
additional information. 
17.Adverse Events: Adverse events (AE) should be documented and recorde d at each visit using National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.03.  For serious adverse events (SAEs), the active reporting period to Pfizer or its designated 
representative begins from the time that the patient provides informed consent, which is obtained prior to the patient’s participation in the study, ie, prior 
to undergoing any study -related procedure and/or receiving study treatment, through and including 90 calendar days after the last administ ration of the 
study treatment (Arm A) or 90 days after the End of Treatment (EOT) visit (Arm B).  SAEs occurring to a patient after the act ive reporting period has 
ended should be reported to the sponsor if the investigator becomes aware of them; at a mini mum, all SAEs that the investigator believes have at least a 
reasonable possibility of being related to study treatment are to be reported to the sponsor.
AEs (serious and non -serious) should be recorded on the Case Report Form (CRF ) from the time the patient has taken at least 1 dose of study treatment 
(Arm A) or from Cycle 1 Day 1(Arm B), through and including 90 calendar days after the last administration of the study drug (Arm A) or 90 days after 
the EOT visit (Arm B).

Page 33If a patient begins a new anticancer therapy, the AE reporting period for non -serious AEs ends at the time the new treatment is started.  Death must be 
reported if it occurs during the SAE reporting period after the last dose of study treatment, irrespective of any intervening treatment.
18.Day 15 Assessments for Arm B: Remote contact (eg, telephone) or in -clinic visit for collection of interim AEs and changes in concomitant medications 
and treatments, if any.  A follow -up in -clinic visit should be scheduled if clinica lly indicated.
19.Concom itant Medications/Treatm ents: Concomitant medications and treatments will be recorded for all patients from 28 days prior to the start of study 
treatment and up to 90 days after the last dose of study treatment (Arm A) or 90 days after the EOT visit (Arm B).  If a patient begins a ne w anti -cancer 
therapy, reporting of concomitant medications should end at the time the new cancer therapy is started; see Section 5.9 for additional details.  All 
concomitant medications will be recorded in the CR F including supportive care drugs (eg, anti-emetic treatment and prophylaxis), the drugs used to treat 
adverse events or chronic diseases, and non -drug supportive interventions (eg, transfusions).  Concomitant medications should be reviewed at each study 
visit, and any prohibited treatments (as described in Section 5.9 )should be discussed with the patient and appropriately managed. 
20.NCCN -FACT FBlSI -18, EQ -5D-5L: All patients will complete these self -administered questionnaires on Day 1 of each cycle.  Patients must complete 
each questionnaire at the clinic prior to any study or medical procedure.
21.Randomization: An interactive response technology (IRT) system will be used for randomization to a treatment arm as de scribed in Section 5.1 .  
Patients meeting all entry criteria w ill be randomized and, if randomized to Arm A, will be administered the first dose of av elumab within 3 days after 
randomization.  
22.Avelum abStudy Treatm ent (Arm  A): For patients randomized to Arm A, avelumab (10 mg/kg) will be given as a 1 -hour intravenous infusion every 
2weeks.  Patients should be weighed within 3 days prior to each dose of avelumab (for determination of the avelumab dose [ mg]).  All safety 
assessments must be performed and results reviewed by the treating physician prior to study treatment administration.  Patien ts with disease progression 
who are continuing to derive clinical benefit from study treatment will be eligible t o continue with avelumab provided that the treating physician has 
determined that the benefit/risk for doing so is favorable (See Section 5.4.1 ). 
23.Best supportive care (BSC) : All patients (Arm A and Arm B) will receive BSC during this study, as described in Section 5.8 .  All BSC components 
must comply with the permitted medications describe d in this protocol (see Section 5.9 ).
24.Archival FFPE Tum or Tissue: An archival formalin fixed, paraffin embedded (FFPE) tumor tissue block (or subsection thereof) collected at the time of 
primary diagnosis or firs t tumor resection (if different from the most recent sample described in footnote 25) is strongly encouraged to assess change s in 
the tumor microenvironment relative to the most recent sample.  If an FFPE tissue block cannot be provided, 15 freshly cut un stained slides (10 
minimum) will be acceptable.  A sample from a later timepoint that is still prior to the most recent tumor tissue sample (see footnote 25) may be 
substituted, if necessary.  Tumor tissue from cytologic samples (eg, FFPE cell pellet from F ine Needle Aspiration biopsy) or bone metastases are not 
acceptable.  See Section 6.1.1 and Section 7.5.1 .
25.Mandatory Recent FFPE Tumor Tissue Block or de novo biopsy: All patients must provide an FFPE tumor tissue block (or subsection thereof) from 
the most recent primary or metastatic tumor biopsy or resection obtained prior to treatment w ith first line chemotherapy but within 24 months prior to 
randomization, with no intervening systemic anti -cancer therapy between the time the tissue was obtained and initiation of first -line chemotherapy.  If an 
FFPE tissue block cannot be provided, 15 freshly cut unstained slides (10 minimum) will be acceptable.  Tumor tissue from cyt ologic sampling (eg, fine 
needle aspiration, including FFPE cell pellet material) or bone metastases is not adequate and should not be submitted.  If a suitab le tissue sample is not 
otherwise available, then an FFPE tissue sample from a de novo biopsy (core needle or excisional) must be obtained for research purposes (ie, after 
informed consent has been obtained and prior to randomization).  See Section 6.1.1 and Section 7.5.1 .
Note: This mandatory tumor tissue sample must be submitted to the Central Laboratory prior to randomization.

Footnotes for PRIOR TO PROTOCOL AMENDMENT 6: SCHEDULE OF ACTIVITI ESFOR END OF TREATMENT/WITHDRAWAL AND 
FOLLOW -UP PERIODS
1.Visit Identifiers: Acceptable time windows for performing each assessment are described in the column headers.  Per the visit time window, laboratory 
tests may be performed up to 3 days prior to the scheduled clinic visit so that results will be available for review.
2.End o f Treatment/Withdrawal: Obtain these assessments if not completed in the prior week, except for tumor assessments, which need not be repeated 
if performed within the prior 6 weeks.
3.Short -and Long -Term Follow -up: All patients will be follow ed for safety every  30 day s (±3 days) through 90 days after the last dose of study 
treatment (Arm A) or 30 through 90 days after the End of Treatment (EOT) visit (Arm B), or until the time of initiation of ne w anticancer treatment.   
Beyond the 90 days until the end of the study (long -term follow -up), all patients will be follow ed every 3 months after the last study clinic visit (14

4.Physical Exa mination: Includes an examination of major body systems.
5.Vital Signs and Weight: Vital signs to include blood pressure and pulse rate.  Blood pressure and pulse rate shou ld be taken with the patient in the 
seated position after the patient has been sitting quietly for at least 5 minutes.  
6.Contraception Check (Arm A patients) : Female patients who are of childbearing potential w ill need to affirm that they meet the criteria for correct use 
of the selected methods of contraception until at least 30 days after the last dose of study treatment.  The investigator or his or her design ee will discuss 
with the patient the need to use the selected contraception methods consistently and correctly and document such conversation s in the patient’s chart.  In 
addition, the investigator or his or her designee will instruct the patient to call i mmediately if the selected contraception methods are discontinued, or if 
pregnancy is known or suspected in the patient or the male patient’s partner.  See Section 4.3.1 .

Page 3710.Serum/Urine Pregnancy Test (Arm A patients) : For female patients of childbearing potential, a serum or urine pregnancy test, with sensitivity of at 
least 25 mIU/mL, will be performed at the End of Treatment/Withdrawal visit and at the 30-Day Follow -up visit, and additionally whenever one 
menstrual cycle is missed or when potential pregnancy is otherwise suspected.  Additional pregnancy tests may also be underta ken if requested by 
Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Ethics Committees (ECs) or if required by local regulations.  See Section 7.1.1 .
11.Urinalysis : Required only at the End of Treatment/Withdrawal.  To be performed as clinically indicated at other time points.  Required tests are listed in 
Table 6.
12. 12- Lead Electrocardiogram  (ECG): When clinically -indicated. Clinically s ignificant new findings seen on follow -up ECGs should be recorded as 
adverse events.  See Section 7.1.5 for further details.
13.Tum or Assessments: Tum or assessments will include all known or suspected disease sites.  Imaging will include chest, abdomen, and pelvis compute d 
tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans.  Bone lesion(s) identified at baseline by bone scan wi ll be further assessed by CT or MRI 
as per local practice (w here bone scans are not used as a routine restaging tool) and subsequently re -assessed by CT or MRI as per the tumor assessment 
schedule as an alternative to bone scans.  Bone imaging (eg, bone sc ans or other methods considered standard of care locally, such as 18FDG -PET or 
MRI) w ill only be repeated during study as clinically indicated (eg, patient describes new or w orsening bone pain, or has inc reasing alkaline phosphatase 
level, or other signs a nd symptoms of new/progressing bone metastases), at the time of complete response (CR) confirmation, and at every other tumor
assessment visit (ie, every 16 weeks for the first year after randomization and every 24 weeks thereafter) if considered local sta ndard of care.  ( Note : 
18FDG -PET m ay not be a permissible alternate for bone imaging at some centers or countries (eg, investigative sites in Canada).   
Brain must be included in subsequent tumor assessments if a patient has brain metastases at baseline; otherwise brain will on ly be evaluated when 
clinically indicated.  
The CT and MRI scans should be performed with contrast agents unless contraindicated f or medical reasons.  The same imaging technique used to 
characterize each identified and reported lesion at baseline will be employed in the following tumor assessments.  All radiog raphic images from the time 
of the most recent tumor assessment prior to first -line chemotherapy until documented disease progression will be submitted to an independent third -
party core imaging laboratory as described in the Study Manual.  
For all patients, anti -tumor activity will be assessed through radiological tumor assessm ents (including chest, abdomen, and pelvic CT or MRI scans) 
conducted every 8 weeks (±3 days) for up to 1 year from randomization and every 12 weeks (±3 days) thereafter until documented disease progression as 
assessed by BICR regardless of initiation of subsequent anti -cancer therapy.   Additional radiological tumor assessments should also be conducted 
whenever disease progression is suspected (eg, symptomatic deterioration).
Assessment of response will be made using RECIST v.1.1 ( Appendix 2).  Complete response ( CR) and partial response (PR) must be confirmed with 
repeated imaging performed at least 4 w eeks after initial documentation of response.  See Section 7.7for additional information.
14.Adverse Events: Adverse events (AE) should be documented and recorded at each visit using National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.03.  For serious adverse events (SAEs), the active reporting period to Pfizer or its designated 
representative begins from the time that the patient provides informed consent, which is obtained prior to the patient’s participation in the study, ie, prior 
to undergoing any study -related procedure and/or receiving study treatment, through and including 90 calendar days after the last administration of t he 
study treatment (Arm A) or 90 day s after the EOT visit (Arm B).  SAEs occurring to a patient after the active reporting period has ended should be 
reported to the sponsor if the investigator becomes aware of them; at a minimum, all SAEs that the investigator believes have at least a reaso nable 
possibility of being related to study treatment are to be reported to the sponsor.

If a patient begins a new anticancer therapy, the AE reporting period for non -serious AEs en ds at the time the new treatment is started.  Death must be 
reported if it occurs during the SAE reporting period after the last dose of study treatment, irrespective of any intervening treatment.
15.Concom itant Medications/Treatm ents: Concomitant medications and treatments will be recorded for all patients from 28 days prior to the start of study 
treatment and up to 90 days after the last dose of study treatment (Arm A) or 90 days after the EOT visit (Arm B).  If a patient begins a ne w anti -cancer 
therapy, reporting of concomitant medications should end at the time the new cancer therapy is started; see Section 5.9 for additional details.  All 
concomitant medications will be recorded in the CR F including supportive care drugs (eg, anti-emetic treatment and prophylaxis), the drugs used to treat 
adverse events or chronic diseases, and non -drug supportive interventions (eg, transfusions). 
16.Survival Assessment: All patients will be followed for su rvival and subsequent anticancer therapies every 3 months (±14 days) after the last study clinic 
visit until death, end of the study, or patient withdrawal of consent, whichever comes first.  These visits may be conducted in-clinic or by remote contact 
(eg,telephone).  Additional timepoints to collect survival information may be requested by the Sponsor in preparation for interim and final analyses.
17.Patient -Reported Outcome Questionnaire: NCCN -FACT FBlSI -18 and EQ -5D-5L are to be administered at the End o f Treatment/Withdraw al visit 
and at the 30, 60 and 90 Day Follow -up Visits.
18.Banked Blood Biospecimens for Exploratory Assessments: Blood biospecimens (~24 mL) will be collected at the End of Treatment/Withdrawal visit 
and retained as whole blood, plasma, and serum (Prep D1: 4 mL K 2EDTA whole blood collection optimized for DNA analysis; Prep B1: 10 mL 
K2EDTA blood for plasma preparation, and Prep B2: 10 mL blood for serum preparation), and retained in a biobank for exploratory biomarker 
assessments, unles s prohibited by local regulation or by decision of the Institutional Review Board or Ethics Committee.  See Section 7.5.2 and 
Section 7.6.
19.De Novo Tum or Biopsy: A de novo (ie, fresh biopsy) tumor sample should also be collected at End of Treatment/Withdraw al visit, unless clinically 
contraindicated.  Tumor tissue from cytologic sampling (eg, fine needle aspiration, including formalin fixed, paraffin embedd ed [FFPE] cell pellet 
material) or bone metastases is not adequate and should not be submitted.  The de no vobiopsy should be formalin -fixed and paraffin -embedded as per 
routine procedures (see Laboratory Manual), and the resulting FFPE tissue block(s) should be submitted to the Central Laborat ory.  If an FFPE tissue 
block cannot be provided, 15 freshly cut un stained slides (10 minimum) will be acceptable.
20.Pharm acokinetics: Arm A ONLY: Blood samples (3.5 mL) for avelumab PK will be taken at the End of Treatment and 30 day Follow -up visits.  Details 
are outlined in Section 7.3.
21.Anti -Avelumab Antibodies (Anti- Drug Antibodies, ADAs) and Neutralizing Antibodies (Nab): Arm A ONLY.  One blood sample (3.5 mL) for 
anti-avelumab antibodies (and simultaneous pharmacokinetic draws for measurement of avelumab) will be collected at the End of Treatment and 30 day 
Follow -up visits.  All the samples that are positive for ADA may also undergo characterization for Nab.

Page 401. Visit Identifiers: All assessments will be performed prior to dosing with avelumab unless otherwise indicated.  Acceptable time windows for performing each assessment 
are described in the column headers.  Note : laboratory tests may be performed up to 3 days prior to the scheduled clinic visit so that results will be available for re view .
2. End of Treatment/Withdrawal: Obtain these assessments if not completed in the prior week.
3. Short -Term Follow -up: All patients will be followed for safety every 30 days (±3 days) through 90 days after the last dose of avelumab or until the time of initiation of a 
new anticancer treatment, whichever occurs first.
4. These data will not be captured in the CRF unless the findings support the reporting of an AE.
5. Weight: Weight should be measured within 3 days prior to each dose of avelumab (for determination of the avelumab dose [mg]).
6. Contraception Check: Female patients who are of childbearing potential will need to affirm that they meet the criteria for correct use of the sele cted methods of 
contraception.  The investigator or his or her designee will discuss with the patient the need to use the selected contraception methods consistently and correctly and 
document such conversations in the patient’s chart.  In addition, the investigator or his or her designee will instruct the p atient to call immediately if the selected 
contraception methods are discontin ued, or if pregnancy is known or suspected in the patient or the male patient’s partner.  See Section 4.3.1 .
7. Hematology and Blood Chemistry: Required tests are listed in Table 7.  May also be performed when clinically indicated.  
8. Thyroid Function and ACTH Tests: Free T4, TSH, and ACTH tests will be performed on Day 1 of every 2 cycles (8 weeks).  Additional tests sh ould be performed 
when clinically indicated.  See Table 7.
9. Serum/Urine Pregnancy Test: For female patients of childbearing potential, a serum or urine pregnancy test , with sensitivity of at least 25 mIU/mL, will be routinely 
repeated prior to each avelumab dose during the active treatment period, at the End of Treatment/Withdrawal visit, and additi onally whenever one menstrual cycle is 
missed or when pot ential pregnancy is otherwise suspected.  Additional pregnancy tests may also be undertaken if requested by Institutional Rev iew Board (IRB)/Ethics 
Committees (ECs) or if required by local regulations.  Results of the pregnancy test should be available pri or to each dosing.  See Section 7.1.1 .
10. 12-Lead Electrocardiogram (ECG): To be performed as clinically indicated.  Clinically significant new findings seen on follow -up ECGs should be recorded as adverse 
events.
11. Tumor Assessments: Tumor assessments will be performed at a frequency as per local standard of care and when progression is suspected. The tumor assessment data will 
no longer be entered into the CRF and radiologic images will no longer be submitted for ce ntral imaging review.
12. Adverse Events: Adverse events (AE) should be documented and recorded at each visit using National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse 
Events (CTCAE) version 4.03.  For serious adverse events (SAEs ), the active reporting period to Pfizer or its designated representative begins from the time that the 
patient provides informed consent, which is obtained prior to the patient’s participation in the study, ie, prior to undergoi ng any study -related proced ure and/or receiving 
study treatment, through and including 90 calendar days after the last administration of the study treatment.  SAEs occurring to a patient after the active reporting period 
has ended should be reported to the sponsor if the investigato r becomes aware of them; at a minimum, all SAEs that the investigator believes have at least a reasonable 
possibility of being related to study treatment are to be reported to the sponsor.
AEs (serious and non -serious) should continue to be recorded on the Case Report Form (CRF) through and including 90 calendar days after the last administration of 
avelumab.
If a patient begins a new anticancer therapy, the AE reporting period for non -serious AEs ends at the time the new treatment is started.  Death must b e reported if it occurs 
during the SAE reporting period after the last dose of study treatment, irrespective of any intervening treatment.
13. Concom itant Medications/Treatments :Concomitant medications and treatments should only be recorded in the CRF if associated with treatment for an AE.
14. Avelumab Treat ment:Avelumab (10 mg/kg) will be given as a 1 hour intravenous infusion every 2 weeks.  Patients should be weighed within 3 days prior to each dose 
of avelumab (for determination of the avelumab dose [mg]).  All safety assessments must be performed and results reviewed by the treating physician prior to avelumab 
administration.  Patients with disease progression who are continuing to derive clinical benefit from study treatment will be eligible to con tinue with avelumab provided 
that the treating physician has determined that the benefit/risk for doing so is favorable (See Section 5.4.1 ).

Page 481.INTRODUCTION
1.1.Mechanism of Action/Indication
Avelumab selectively binds to programmed death -ligand 1 (PD -L1) and competitively  blocks 
its interaction with programmed death protein 1 (PD -1).  The mechanism of avelumab action 
is further described in Section 1.2.2.1 .
The indication under study  is the maintenance treatment of unresectable locally  advanc ed or 
metastatic urothelial cancer (UC) after standard first -line platinum containing chemotherap y. 
1.2.Background and Rationale
1.2.1. Urothelial Cancer
UC includes tumors originating from the urothelial cells lining the bladder, renal pelvis, 
ureter, and urethra.1  Bladder cancer alone accounts for 90% of UC,1and is the ninth most 
prevalent cancer worldwide, with approximately  400,000 new cases diagnosed and 
150,000 deaths attributed to this disease each year.2  UC occurs more frequently  in developed 
countries; in Europe it is the eighth most common cause of mortality  due to cancer and 
occurs at a very  high annual incidence rate (20.5 per 100,000 persons) in the United States.3,4  
The incidence and mortality  of bladder cancer have remained unchanged over the last 
25years.2
Approximately  30% of patients with newly  diagnosed UC present with muscle -invasive UC 
of the bladder,5a high- grade, t ypically aggressive disease requiring multimodal therap y 
including radical cy stectomy  and chemotherapy .1,6,7  Metastatic disease is observed in 5% of 
patients at the time of diagnosis6or, if localized at dia gnosis, metastasis develops within 
2years when treated with radical cy stectom y alone.8,9
Combination chemotherapy  with platinum -based regimens is the standard of care for locall y 
advanced or metastatic bladder cancer.  Despite the favorable response and survival rates 
associated with the combination of methotrexate, vinblast ine, doxorubicin, and cisplatin 
(MVAC),10,11,12toxicities associated with this regimen can be significant and lead to death in 
3-4% of patients.12,13  Subsequently , the combinations of gemcitabine + cisplatin and 
gemcitabine + carboplatin were shown to have comparable efficacy  and an improved safet y 
compared to MVAC,14,15,16with the latter combination used in the 30 -50% of patients 
ineligible for cisplatin-based chemotherap y due to renal impairment.17  As such, these two 
regimens are now the preferred regimens for the initial treatment of patients with locally  
advanced or metastatic UC.
1.2.2. Pharmaceutical and Therapeutic Background 
1.2.2.1. Avelumab (MSB0010718C)
The investigational product in the present clinical trial is avelumab (MSB0010718C), a fully  
human monoclonal antibody  (mAb) of the immunoglobulin (Ig) G1 isoty pe.

Page 49Avelumab selectively binds to programmed death -ligand 1 (PD -L1) and competitively  blocks 
its interaction with programmed death protein 1 (PD -1).  Compared with anti- PD-1 
antibod ies that target T -cells, avelumab targets tumor cells, and therefore is expected to have 
fewer side effects, including a lower risk of autoimmune- related safet y issues, as blockade of 
PD-L1 leaves the programmed death ligand 2 (PD -L2)/PD -1 pathway  intact t o promote 
peripheral self -tolerance.18  For complete details of the in vitro and nonclinical studies, refer 
to the Avelumab Investigator’s Brochure.19
Avelumab is being developed jointly  by Pfizer and Merck KGaA/EMD Serono, and is being 
studied in a wide variet y of adult cancers, such as non -small cell lung cancer, gastric cancer, 
Merkel cell carcinoma, renal cell carcinoma, ovarian cancer, and urothelial cancer.  
Trial EMR100070-001 is a Phase 1, open- label, multiple -ascending dose clinical study  aimed 
to investigate the safet y, tolerability , pharmacokinetics (PK), biological activity , and clinical 
activity  of avelumab in patients with metastatic or locally  advanced solid tumors.  This trial 
consists of 2 parts, a dose -escalation phase and a dose -expansion phase, which is performed 
in selected t umor indications.  Avelumab is administered intravenousl y (IV) at the assigned 
dose level as a 1 -hour infusion once every  2 weeks (Q2W).  The following dose levels have 
been investigated: 1.0 mg/kg, 3.0 mg/kg, 10.0 mg/kg, and 20.0 mg/kg.
As of 01 June 2015 , 53 patients were treated in the dose- escalation phase of the 
EMR10070-001, with 4, 13, 15, and 21 patients treated with avelumab doses of 1, 3, 10, and 
20mg/kg, respectivel y.  None of the patients treated with doses up to 10 mg/kg experienced 
a dose -limiting toxicity  (DL T), and the 10 mg/kg dose of avelumab was thus considered a 
safe and well -tolerated dose for further investigation in the dose -expansion cohorts.  One 
DLT (a Grade 3 immune -related adverse event characterized by  increased creatine kinase,
myositis, and my ocarditis) was observed in 1 patient at the dose of 20 mg/kg.
As of 01 June 2015, 717 patients have been enrolled in the tumor ty pe specific expansion 
cohorts and treated with the recommended dose of 10 mg/kg avelumab (Q2W); safety  data 
were available for all of these patients as of the data cut- off date and are briefly  summarized 
here. 
Treatment -related treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were observed in 498 (69.5%) 
subjects in the pooled expansion cohorts.  The most frequentl y obs erved treatment- related 
TEAEs (with an incidence of 5%) of an y grade were infusion -related reaction (18.7%), 
fatigue (18.1%), nausea (10.3%), diarrhea (6.8%), chills (6.7%), and decreased appetite 
(5.2%).  The most frequently  reported (incidence 5%) trea tment -related TEAEs (an y grade) 
in the pooled expansion cohort are summarized in Table 1.  The most frequently  reported 
(occurring in at least 3 patients) Grade 3 treatment- related TEAEs in the pooled expansion 
cohorts are presented in Table 2.

As of 01 June 2015, 289 of 717 patients (40.3%) in the pooled expansion cohorts had at least 
1 serious TEAE.  Treatment- related serious TEAEs were reported in 47 of these patients, and 
included infusion-related reaction and pneumonitis (each in 6 subjects; 0.8%), p yrexia 
(4subjects; 0.6%), autoimmune hepatitis and dy spnea (each in 3 subjects; 0.4%), and colitis

TEAEs were reported in a single subject (0.1%) only .
Among the 717 patients, 290 patients (40.4%) have died, mostly  due to disease progression 
(216 deaths; 30.1%).  Overall, a total of 4 deaths (0.6%) due to TEAEs related to study  
treatment were considered as the primary  reason of the death by  the investigator .  Two 
additional cases of death were reported and assessed as treatment -related, but the treatment 
related TEAEs were not considered as the primary  reason of the death .  These 6 deaths due to 
TEAEs related to stud y treatment were attributed to the followi ng events: pneumonitis 
radiation induced and d yspnea; acute liver failure associated with autoimmune hepatitis (no 
biopsy /autops y performed); fatal anoxic brain injury (not related) after cardiac arrest

A total of 139 patients (19.4%) in the dose expansion cohorts withdrew permanently  from 
study  treatment due to TEAEs.  In 60 (8.4%) of these patients, the TEAEs leading to study  
treatment discontinuation were considered to be related to study  treatment by  the 
investigator.  The most frequent ( 2patients) treatment -related TEAEs leading to 
discontinuation were infusion- related reaction (19 patients; 2.6%), 
gamma -glutamy ltransferase increased (5 patients; 0.7%), autoimmune hepatitis, blood 
creatine phosphokinase increased, and lipase increased (3 patients; 0.4%), and dy spnea 
(2patients; 0 .3%).
Immune -related Adverse Events : As of 01 June 2015, a cumulative review identified 
106patients with potential immune -related adverse events (irAEs) out of 717 patients 
(14.8%) treated in the pooled expansion cohort of trial EMR 100070 -001.  Treatment -related 
potential irAEs were observed in 71 of the 717 patients (9.9%).  Hy pothy roidism was the 
most frequent treatment- related irAE, which occurred in 32 patients (4.5%) in the pooled 
expansion cohort.  The other frequent irAEs, which were considered as treatment- related, 
were pneumonitis (8 patients; 1.1%), autoimmune hepatitis and hy perthy roidism (4 patients; 
0.6%), and colitis and dry ey e (3patients each; 0.4%).  Additional treatment -related irAEs 
were seen in 2 or 1 patients in the pooled expansion c ohort. 
Infusion-Related Reactions: Two suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSARs; 
anaph ylactic reaction and infusion- related reaction) involving 2 patients were reported in 
December 2013 and triggered a cumulative review of serious and non -serious cases of 
infusion- related reactions and hy persensitivity  across the avelumab program.  Following 
evaluation of safet y signals, infusion- related reactions and hy persensitivity were classified as 
a newl y identified risk (previously classified as a pote ntial risk) and a mandatory  
premedication regimen of a histamine H1 receptor (H1) blocker plus 
acetaminophen/paracetamol was implemented for all trial patients starting 29 January  2014.
As of 01 June 2015, 138 of 717 patients (19.2%) in the pooled expansion cohort experienced 
at least 1 episode of infusion -related reaction.  Most of the events were Grade 1 (30 patients, 
4.2%) or Grade 2 (101 patients, 14.1%) in intensity , and Grade 3 (5patients, 0.7%) or 
Grade 4 events (2 patients, 0.3%) were less frequent .  No Grade 5 events were reported.  
Most of the infusion- related reactions had an onset after the first (91 patients, 12.7%) or 
second (35 patients, 4.9%) avelumab infusion, and those with an onset after the third 
(9patients, 1.3%) or fourth avelumab infusion (3 patients, 0.4%) were less frequent.  In 
17patients (2.4%), avelumab treatment was discontinued because of infusion -related 
reaction. 
After introduction of the mandatory  premedication on 29 January  2014, 35 and 677 patients 
in the dose escalation and the pooled expansion cohorts of Trial EMR 100070- 001 received 
trial treatment, respectively .  Under this premedication procedure, 117 of 677 patients 
(17.3%) in the pooled expansion cohort experienced infusion -related reaction, with 
28patients (4.1%) having Grade 1, 86 patients (12.7%) having Grade 2, and 3 patients

introduction of the mandatory  premedication.  Three patients (8.6%) in the dose escalation 
cohort reported infusion -related reactions (all Grade 2) starting from 29 January  2014.
In addition to the aforementioned patients, 1 case of Grade 4 cardiac arrest occurred 
1.5hours after the third infusion of avelumab (10 mg/kg).  The patient died due to anoxic 
brain injury  7days later; no autopsy  was performed. 
The management of infusion- related reactions and severe h ypersensitivity  reactions can be

Myocarditis: As reported in the I nvestigator’s Brochure,19three cases of myocarditis have 
been reported among patients receiving avelumab:
A case of fatal m yocarditis (case no. E2B_80035746) occurred in a patient enrolled in 
study  B9991002, a Phase I  study  of avelumab in combination with axitinib in renal 
cell carcinoma.  The event occurred 5 day s after the second and 19 day s after the first 
dose of avelumab (10 mg/kg).  
A case of non -fatal my ocarditis (case no. 260076) was reported in the context of a 
Grade 3 autoimmune sy ndrome characterized by  myositis and my ocarditis in a patient 
enrolled in study  EMR 100070 -001, a Phase I study  of avelum ab in patients with 
advanced solid tumors.  The event occurred 18 days after the first dose of avelumab 
(20 mg/kg).
A fatal case of potential autoimmune my ocarditis, acute cardiac failure and 
respiratory  failure (case no. 8091934) occurred in a patient enr olled in study  EMR 
100070 -004, a Phase III study  of avelumab as a second -line treatment for non- small 
cell lung cancer.  The events occurred 14 day s after the first and onl y dose of 
avelumab (10 mg/kg).
Cases of severe or fatal my ocarditis also have been r eported with other immune checkpoint 
inhibitors, including pembrolizumab, nivolumab, and ipilimumab,20-24either as single 
adverse events or in the context of more complex autoimmume sy ndromes.  For both 
ipilimumab and nivolumab, my ocarditis is reported in the prescribing information with a 
frequency  of <1%.25,26  
Given these reports, routine troponin measurements are being implemented in selec ted 
avelumab studies, including Protocol B9991001.  Cardiac troponin (cTn) is a sensitive 
marker of m yocardial injury  and may  aid in the identification of patients potentially  
experiencing m yocarditis; however, the utility  of routine troponin monitoring fo r the earl y 
detection of m yocarditis is currentl y unknown.  In addition to cTn monitoring, guidelines for 
the management of suspected or confirmed m yocarditis and relevant avelumab management 
instructions are provided in Table 5.

Page 53Avelumab Pharmacokinetics: Avelumab pharmacokinetics and dose proportionality  
following the first 1 -hour infusion have been characterized in 77 mainly  Caucasian patients 
treated in the dose escalation and expansion cohorts of Study  EMR 100070 -001 by  standard 
non-compartmental analy sis.  This anal ysis revealed that the exposure parameters of C maxand 
AUC τincreased with dose in a linear fashion across the 1, 3, 10 and 20 mg/kg doses.  The 
apparent half -life tends to increase with the dose, presumabl y linked to target -mediated 
disposition.  Taking into account the variability , the half -lives of the 10 and 20 mg/kg doses 
were similar (mean half -lives of 102 and 120 hours, respectivel y), indicating that target 
mediated elimination does not increase at these doses.  This implies that target occupancy  is 
likely  to be high at these two doses throughout the dosing interval. 
Target occupancy  on peripheral blood CD3+ T -cells was investigated in human blood from 
8healthy  volunteers in vitro by  flow cytometry  after spiking of whole blood samples with 
avelumab over a concentration range of 0.003 -10g/mL.  Fift y perce nt (50%) receptor 
occupancy  was observed at a drug concentration of 0.122 g/mL ±0.042 g/mL  with a 
plateau indicating at least 95% receptor occupancy reached in all blood samples at 1 g/mL.  
PK profiles obtained from the dose escalation phase of Study  EMR 100070- 001 found all 
patients at 10 mg/kg dose reached or exceeded the serum level (median C trough 20-37ug/ml) 
of avelumab required for >95% target occupancy .  For patients treated with 3 mg/kg of 
avelumab, 10 of 13 patients reached the required serum l evel (3.7 - 8.3 g/mL ).
Complete information for avelumab may  be found in the single reference safety  document 
(SRSD), which for this study  is the Avelumab Investigator’s Brochure.19
1.2.2.2. Rationale for Best Supportive Care as Comparator Arm
Currently , there are no approved therapeutic agents for the maintenance treatment of patients 
with unresectable UC who have completed prior sy stemic therapy  with a platinum- based 
regimen.  Despite improvement of patient outcomes with these first -line therapies, durable 
and complete responses (CRs) in patients with advanced UC are uncommon and severe side 
effects limit long -term use of these agents.  Following complet ion of first -line therapy , 
patients are managed with best supportive care (BSC) until disease progression.  The 
“Guideline on the evaluation of anticancer medicinal products in man” (European Medicines 
Agency  (EMA)/Committee for Medicinal Products for Huma n Use (CHMP)/205/95/Rev.4, 
Dec2012) indicates that BSC may  be acceptable in cases where there is no well -documented 
reference regimen.  This guideline also defines BSC to include antibiotics, nutritional 
support, correction of metabolic disorders, optimal symptom control and pain management 
(including palliative radiotherap y), etc., but does not include active anti -tumor therapy .  
1.2.3. Rationale for Studying Avelumab plus Best Supportive Care in Patients with 
Advanced Urothelial Cancer
1.2.3.1. Medical Need
Durable CR f ollowing first -line chemotherap y in patients with advanced UC are uncommon.  
Complicated treatment regimens and severe side effects limit long -term use of these agents 
and most patients will ultimately  experience disease progression within 9 months after i nitial 
response.14  Patients with stable disease (SD) or objective response (OR) are typicall y

Page 54managed with BSC alone after completion of first -linechemotherap y until progression of 
disease occurs and onl y then begin treatment with an alternate therap y.  While 
platinum -based combination chemotherap y leads to high response rates in patients with UC, 
most patients will ultimately  experience disease progression.  Optimal treatment in the 
second -line treatment setting still needs to be determined.27  Single and combination agents 
evaluated in this treatment setting have been associated with low median progression -free 
survival (PFS, 1.5-3.0 months) and overall survival (OS, 4.6.-6.9 months), and are also 
associated with significant toxicities.28,29,30
In 2009, vinflunine was approved in Europe for the second -line treatment of UC after failure 
of first -line platinum -based therap y.28,31  Three hundred sevent y (370) adult patients with 
advanced or metastatic transitional -cell carcinoma of the urothelial tract were randoml y 
assigned 2:1 to vinflunine plus BSC or BSC alone in a Phase 3 trial.  Patients had previously  
received platinum- based therap y after which relapse had occurred.  In the intent -to-treat 
(ITT) population, the median OS was 6.9 months for vinflunine plus BSC vs 4.6 months for 
BSC alone.  In multivariate Cox an alysis, the addition of vinflunine was independentl y 
correlated with improved survival (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.719; 95% confidence interval 
[CI]:0.570 -0.906, P =0.0052).28  However, the response rate with vinflunine is disappointing 
and it has not been formally  compared with other commonly  used agents such as taxanes.  
The current “watch -and-wait” approach for the management of metastatic UC following 
response to fir st-line chemotherapy  prior to initiation of second -line treatment has not proven 
to be effective because almost all patients eventually  relapse.  A multicenter Phase 2 study  of 
sunitinib as maintenance therap y in patients with advanced UC was recently repo rted.32  
Although the stud y terminated prematurel y due to low patient recruitment, it provided a 
different perspective on the treatment of this disease (ie, mainte nance therapy  following 
response to first -line chemotherapy  in an attempt to improve the durability  of the initial 
response).  Very  recently, Powles et al reported the results of a Phase 2/3 study  of lapatinib 
as maintenance treatment after first -line chem otherapy  in patients with HER1/HER2 -positive 
UC.33  Between 2007 and 2013, 455 patients were screened and 232 HER 1 or 2 positive 
patients randomized to lapatinib (n = 116) or placebo (n = 116).  The median PFS, median 
OS, and objective response rate (ORR) for lapatinib vs. placebo were 4.6 months (95% CI : 
2.8 –5.4) vs. 5.3 months (95% CI : 3.0 –5.9) (HR: 1.04 [95% CI : 0.79 – 1.39] p = 0.77); 
12.6 months (95% CI : 9.5 –16.2) vs. 11.9 months (95% CI: 10.6 – 15.8) (HR 0.98 [95% CI : 
0.71 –1.35] p = 0.89); and 13.8% vs. 7.8%, respectively (p = 0.14).  Subset anal ysis of 1) 
HER1/HER2 3+ positive UC patients on immunohistochemistry  (IHC), 2) HER1- positive 
UC patients, and 3) HER2 -positive UC patients showed no significant benefit for lapatinib 
compared to placebo in median PFS (HR 0.94, 0.99, and 1.19 respectivel y; p >0.05 for each) 
or median OS (HR: 0.76, 0.92, and 1.03 respectively; p >0.05 each).  In addition, a study  
evaluating vinflunine34,35as a maintenance UC treatment is currentl y ongoing.
1.2.3.2. Rationale for Immunotherapy for Maintenance Treatment of Urothelial Cancer
There is a strong rationale for considering immunotherap y in patients with advanced UC.  
Urologists led the way  in the use of immunotherapy  in cancer in 1976, having introduced the 
tuberculosis vaccine bacille Calmette- Guéri n (BCG), which stimulates a robust immune 
response in most patients and has become the standard of care as locoregional therap y after

Page 55surgical resection of non -muscle -invasive disease.36,37  Multiple immunotherapies including 
interferon (IFN) -α, interleukin (IL) -2, IL -12, and IL -10 have been investigated, either as 
adjuncts w ith BCG or as a solo replacement therapy .38,39  Over the past 40 years, progress 
evaluating immunotherapy  for bladder cancer has been slow.  Subsequently , the PD -1/PD -L1 
pathway  has emerged as an important biological pathway in UC.40,41,42  PD-1, an 
immunoinhibitory  receptor of the CD28 famil y, plays an important role in tumor immune 
escape.43,44  The PD -1/PD-L1 interaction inhibits T -lymphocy te activation, proliferation, 
survival, and effector functions during anti -cancer immune response.  Several tumors, 
including UC, present with high rates of somatic mutations,45,46,47possibly  enhancing the 
host immune sy stem’s ability  to recognize tumor cells as foreign owing to an increased 
number of antigens and stimulate T- cell response.48  However, these cancers may also elude 
immune surveillance and eradication through the expression of PD -L1 in the tumor 
microenvironment,49which then becomes an important target for anti- PD-L1 antibodies.  
Indeed, antibodies blocking PD -1 and PD -L1 have demonstrated significant and durable 
response in patients with advanced UC.  In a Phase 1b study  of anti -PD-1 mAb 
pembrolizumab in heavily  pre-treated patients with advanced UC,40the ORR was 
24% (10% CR) among 33 treated patients with median follow- up duration of 11 months 
(range 10 -13).  The responses observed were durabl e, ranging from 16 to 40+ weeks (median 
not reached), with several responses ongoing at the time of anal ysis.
Similarly , an anti -PD-L1 mAb, MPDL -3280A, recently  demonstrated significant durable 
response in heavily  pre-treated patients with UC.41,42  Preliminary  data presented at the 
ASCO 2014 Annual Meeting from a Phase 1 study of MPDL -3280A as second -line treatment 
of patients with PD -L1 positive UC demonstrated noteworthy  activity  in 20evaluable 
patients with an ORR of 50%, including 1 CR and 9 partial response (PRs).41  Durable 
responses were also demonstrated with this agent in heavily pre -treated patients with 
advanced stage UC,41,42with an ORR of 54% in 68 pa tients with PD -L1-positive tumors, 
with durable ongoing responses up to 30.3 weeks reported.41  Updated data from these 
studies with MPDL -3280A and pembrolizumab in patients with recurrent or metastatic 
PD-L1-positive UC further indicated durable responses with promising PFS and OS in 
patients with PD -L1-positive tumors, local immune/inflammatory  cells, or stroma.  Among 
85 patients (46 PD- L1 immunohistochemistry  [IHC] 2/3 and 38 I HC 0/1) with UC who 
received MPDL -3280A, the ORR for PD -L1 IHC 2+/3+ UC patients was 46% (95% CI: 
31-61%; 6 CRs, 15 PRs) and IHC 0/1+ UC patients was 16% (95% CI 6 -31%; 6 PRs); 
median response durations not reached (IHC 2/3 0+ to 54+ weeks; IHC 0/1 4+ to 33+weeks).  
Median PFS for IHC 2+/3+ UC patients was 24 weeks (95% CI 12 -NE) and for IHC 0/1+ 
UC patients was 8 weeks (95% CI 6- 12).50  Among 33 patie nts enrolled with 
≥1% PD-L1-positive cells in tumor nests or a PD -L1-positive band in stroma by  IHC to 
receive pembrolizumab, 28 had measurable disease at baseline.  In these evaluable patients, 
the ORR was 25% (95% CI : 11-45), with 3 (11%) CR and 4 (14%) PR, with durations 
ranging from 16 to 50+ weeks (median not reached at time of anal ysis).51
Avelumab, a potent and highl y selective fully human mAb of the Ig G1 isoty pe, targets and 
blocks PD -L1, the ligand for PD -1 and B7.1 receptors.  Avelumab binds PD- L1 and blocks 
the interaction between PD -L1 and PD -1 and B7.1, removing the suppressive effects of PD -
L1 on anti -tumor CD8+ T -cells and resulting in restoration of the cy totoxic T -cell response.19

Page 56Avelumab has demonstrated an efficacy  and safety profile similar to other PD -1/PD -L1 
inhibitors.19,52
In the ongoing Phase 1 study  EMR 100070- 001, 53 patients were treated with avelumab 
doses of 1.0, 3.0, 10.0, and 20.0 mg/kg administered IV Q2W in the dose escalation phase.  
The 10 mg/kg dose level was selected for further study  and a summary  of pooled safet y data 
from1738 patients treated at this dose level in studies EMR 100070 -001 and EMR 
100070 -003 (N=1738) is available with a data cutoff date of 09 June 2016.19  The most 
frequentl y reported (incidence >5%) treatment- related adverse events were fatigue ( 17.7%), 
infusion- related reaction (17.0%), nausea (8.6%), diarrhea (7.1%), chills (6.7%), p yrexia 
(6.1%), decreased appetite (5.2%), and h ypoth yroidism (5.0%).   
Updated data from a pooled anal ysis of 249 patients enrolled in two advanced UC expansion 
cohorts in study EMR 100070 -001 was recentl y published.75  Patients were included 
regardless of PD -L1 expression levels. The median age was 68 years and 124 (50%) patients 
received 2 or more prior treatments for advanced or metastatic disease.  At the time of the 
analysis (09 June 2016 data cut -off), the median followup was 9.9 months (range 4.3-12.1 
months) and 60 (24%) patients were still on treatment. A mong 161 post -platinum patients 
with at least 6 months of follow-up, the ORR was 17% (95% CI: 11- 24%), including 9 CRs 
and 18 PRs.  The disease control rate (DCR) was 40%, including 37 patients who had SD as 
their best response.  An analy sis using a cut- off of 5% for the expression of PD -L1 on 
tumor cells in 139 evaluable patients showed a 24% (15/63) ORR in the PD- L1 positive 
population and 13% (10/76) in the PD -L1 negative population, supporting that avelumab has 
anti-tumor activity  in both the PD -L1 positive and negative populations.  The median PFS 
was 11.9 weeks (95% CI:6.1-18.0 weeks) and 6.1 weeks (95% CI : 5.9-8.0 weeks) in the 
PD-L1 positive and negative populations, respectively .  The median OS was 8.2 months 
(95% CI : 5.7-13.7 months) and 6.2 mont hs (95% CI : 4.3-14.0 months) in patients with 
PD-L1 positive and negative tumors, respectivel y.
These data support further evaluation of avelumab (MSB0010718C) for the treatment of 
patients with advanced stage UC.  Given the poor prognosis for patients wit h advanced UC 
whose disease progresses after first -line chemotherap y, where patient outcomes are 
ultimately  very  poor,30,53a maintenance treatment with avelumab after first -line 
platinum -based chemotherap y ma y provide additional clinical benefit compared to the 
current watch- and-wait standard of care after chemotherapy .  The current treatment 
recommendation for the first -line treatment of advanced UC is platinum -based 
chemotherap y,1which has been administered for a maximum of 6 cycles in previously  
completed clinical trials.12,14,15,54  Due to the toxicities associated with platinum -based 
chemotherap y, these therapies are not administered long term; patients who respond to 
first-line treatment are then managed with BSC until disease relapse or progression, when 
second -line treatments are considered.  The safet y and efficacy  of avelumab plus best 
supportive care (BSC, Arm A) and BSC alone (Arm B) will be evaluated in two coprimary  
populations: 1) patients with PD -L1-positive tumors (including infiltrating immune cells) 
confirmed b y a verified Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) PD -L1 IHC test, and 2) all 
randomized patients to assess the effects of avelumab in this therapeutic setting.

As described in the previous section, recent data demonstrate that immune checkpoint 
inhibitors, including avelumab, are capable of inducing objective tumor response in advanced 
UC patients and may  provide further clinical benefit by  prolonging overall survival.41,42,51,55  
The strategy  of the proposed trial is to maintain or extend early  clinical benefit following 
completion of first -line platinum -based chemotherapy  in patients with advanced urothelial 
cancer b y providing maintenance immunotherap y with avelumab.  In this study, patients 
assigned to receive avelumab may  continue to do so until their disease progresses or they  
discontinue due t o other reasons.  The potential benefits of avelumab maintenance therap y 
may include delay  in the subsequent treatment with more toxic 2ndline chemotherap y as well 
as an improvement in overall survival.
An open -label design was chosen over a double -blind placebo- controlled design after 
assessment of risk -benefit considerations.  As the study  medication (avelumab) is 
administered as a 1 -hour infusion, the use of an intravenous placebo would be associated 
with some risks (eg, injection site reactions) and wi th no benefit to the patient.  Additionally , 
in order to preserve the blind, the use of a placebo infusion would require premedication with 
an H1 blocker and paracetamol prior to infusion as required for patients receiving avelumab 
to limit the incidence a nd severit y of infusion -related reactions, an unnecessary  practice for 
patients receiving placebo. 
Overall survival (OS) will be the primary  endpoint.  PFS assessed by  Blinded I ndependent 
Central Review (BICR) as well as the objective response as determin ed by RECI STv1.1 
guidelines, will be secondary  endpoints. 
At the pre -specified interim analy sis (Section 9.6), this study  met the primary  objective and 
demonstrated that avelumab plus BSC significantly  prolongs OS compared to BSC alone in
both co- primary  populations (ie, in all randomized patients and in patients with 
PD-L1-positive tumors) .  Based on this result, the E -DMC recommended that remaining 
patients on Arm B who are progression-free be offered crossover to avelumab.  For 
additional information, please refer to Supplement 1.  
As the prima ry objective for the study  was met (see above), a final OS update will be 
conducted after the target number of OS events has been reached (see Section 9.1; 425 OS 
events in all patients and 219 OS events in patients with PD -L1 positive tumors).  Following
this final OS update or approval of Protocol Amendment 6, whichever is later, the frequency  
of study  procedures will be reduced for p atients actively  receiving avelumab and study  
participation for all others will be ended.  Investigators will be appropriately notified once 
the final OS update has been completed and Amendment 6 can be full y implemented.
1.2.4. Rationale for Avelumab Dose and Be st Supportive Care Regimens
Arm A patients will receive avelumab plus BSC.  The avelumab dose will be 10 mg/kg 
administered as a 1 -hour IV infusion every  2weeks (Q2W).  This dose is the recommended 
dose administered to >700 patients in the ongoing dose -expansion phase of study  EMR 
100070 -001 (see Section 1.2.2.1 for details and the Avelumab Investigator’s Brochure).19

Page 58Arm B patients will receive BSC as deemed appropriate b y the treating ph ysician (see 
Section 5.8 ).  Currentl y, there are no approved therapeutic agents for the maintenance 
treatment of patients with unresectable UC who have completed pr ior systemic 
platinum -based therap y without progression of disease.  Despite improvement of patient 
outcomes with these first -line therapies, durable and complete responses in patients with 
advanced UC are uncommon, and severe side effects limit long -term use of these agents.  
These patients are t ypically managed with BSC alone until progression of disease occurs, and 
only then are they  treated with an alternate therap y.13,30  Salvage cy totoxic agents have not 
demonstrated meaningful improvements in survival.30  Initiation of maintenance therapy in 
an attempt to improve the durability of response and prolong time to progression is an 
alternate approach to management of this disease.32,34,35,56  The “ Guideline on the evaluation
of anticancer medicinal products in man” (EMA/CHMP/205/95/Rev.4, Dec 2012) indicates 
that BSC may  be an acceptable comparator in cases where there is no well -documented 
reference regimen.  
1.3.Summary of Benefit -Risk Assessment
An evaluation of the anticipat ed benefits and risks as required in Article 3(2)(a) of Directive 
2001/20/EC (cf. Article 6(3)(b) of Directive 2001/20/EC) has been conducted.
For single -agent avelumab, based on the nonclinical and Phase 1 trial EMR 100070-001 
clinical data available to d ate, the conduct of the trial with the proposed avelumab dosing 
regimen is considered justifiable.  
The anti -tumor activit y of several PD -1/PD -L1 inhibitors,40,41,42including avelumab in the 
cohort of pretreated patients with UC in Study  EMR 100070 -001, support the formal testing 
of avelumab in the maintenance treatment setting following first -line chemotherapy  in 
patients with unresectable locall y advanced or metastatic UC that did not progress on 
first-line chemotherap y.
Available adverse event and laboratory  abnormality  data from patients with advanced solid 
tumors treated with single agent avelumab suggest an acceptable safet y profile for this agent.  
Most of the observed events were either in line with those expected in patients with advanced 
solid tumors or with similar class effects of monoclonal antibodies blocking the PD -1/PD -L1 
axis (see Section 1.2.2.1).  
Infusion- related reactions (including hy persensitivity ) and immune related adverse events 
(irAEs )/autoimmune disorders have been identified as important risks for avelumab.  
Respective risk mitigation measures have been implemented in all ongoing clinical studies 
with avelumab, including this clinical trial protocol.  These include a treatment algori thm and 
guidelines for treatment interruption and discontinuation in case of irAEs, as well as 
instructions for mandatory pre- medication with a histamine H1 receptor (H1) blocker and 
acetaminophen before the first 4 avelumab infusions.  
Thus, the projecte d benefit/risk of avelumab administered in the first- line maintenance 
setting in patients with locally  advanced or metastatic UC is anticipated to be favorable for 
investigation in this advanced cancer patient population.

3.1.1. Study Treatment 
For the purpose of this study , “stud y treatment” refers to both the investigational 
product (avelumab) plus BSC and BSC alone administered to patients during 
participation in this study .  
Study  treatments may  continue until confirmed disease progression as assessed by  
BICR, patient ref usal, patient lost to follow up, unacceptable toxicity , or the study  is 
terminated by the sponsor, whichever comes first (see Section 6.5Patient 
Withdrawal ).  
According to the opinion of an investigator, if a patient in Arm A is still experiencing 
clinical benefit at the time of confirmed disease progression, the patient will be 
eligible for continued treatment with av elumab plus BSC, provided the treating 
physician has determined that the benefit/risk for doing so is favorable (see 
Section 5.4.1 Treatment after Initial Evidence of Radiologic Disease Progression).  
Radiological tumor assessments will be continued in these patients as described in the 
Section 3.1.2 , Tumor Assessments.
If a patient starts a new anti -cancer therap y before documented disease progression, 
then tumor assessments should be continued per the Schedule of Activities (unles s not 
feasible) until documentation of disease progression or death, whichever occurs first. 
After review of radiologic images b y BICR is stopped as per Protocol Amendment 6, 
following the final OS update, study  treatment may  continue until disease progre ssion 
is assessed b y the investigator, patient refusal, patient lost to follow -up, unacceptable 
toxicity , or the stud y is terminated by the sponsor, whichever comes first (see 
Section 6.5 Patient Withdrawal).  
Arm A: Avelumab (MSB0010718C) plus Best Supportive Care
Patients randomized to avelumab plus BSC (Arm A) will be administered avelumab 
as a 1 -hour IV infusion at a dose of 10 mg/kg once every 2 weeks together with BSC 
(see below).
To mitigate potential inf usion-related reactions, patients in Arm A will be 
premedicated prior to avelumab administration as described in Section 5.4.3.1.  If an 
infusion- related reaction is observed, the infusion rate should be decreased or stopped 
depending on the severity of the event; please refer to Section 5.4.3.2 for further 
guidance.

Page 64Arm B: Best Supportive Care Alone
Patients randomized to BSC alone (Arm B) will be cared for as deemed appr opriate 
by the treating phy sician.  This could include treatment with antibiotics, nutritional 
support, correction of metabolic disorders, optimal sy mptom control and pain 
management (including palliative radiotherap y), etc.  BSC does not include any  
active anti -tumor therapy (see Section 5.8 ), however local radiotherap y of isolated 
lesions with palliative intent is acceptable as described in Section 5.9.2 .
3.1.2. Tumor Assessments
Anti- tumor activity  will be assessed b y radiological tumor assessments and will be based on 
RECI ST v1.1 ( Appendix 2).
Tumor assessments will include all known or suspected disease sites.  For all patients, 
imaging assessments will include chest, abdomen, and pelvis computerized tomograph y (CT) 
or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans.  Bone imaging, eg, bone scans or other methods 
considered standard of care locall y, such as 18 -Fluorodeox yglucose Positron Emission 
Tomograph y (18FDG -PET) or MRI, are required at baseline (28 day screening period).  
(Note : 18FDG -PET may  not be a permissible alternate for bone imaging at some centers or 
countries (eg, investigative sites in Canada).  Bone lesion(s) identified at baseline b y bone 
scan will be further assessed by  CT or MRI as per local practice (where bone scans are not 
used as a routine restaging tool) and subsequently  re-assessed by  CT or MRI as per the tumor 
assessment schedule as an alternative to bone scans.  Bone imaging will only be repeated 
during stud y as clinically indicated (eg, patient describes new or worsening bone pain, or has 
increasing alkaline phosphatase level, or other signs and sy mptoms of new/progressing bone 
metastases), at the time of complete response (CR) confirmation, and at every  other tumor 
assessment visit (ie, every 16 weeks for the f irst year after randomization and every  24 weeks 
thereafter) if considered local standard of care.  
Brain imaging (eg, MRI) is required at baseline for patients who have a history  of brain 
metastases or for whom brain metastases are suspected during scree ning.  Brain must be 
included in subsequent tumor assessments if a patient has brain metastases at baseline; 
otherwise brain will only be evaluated when clinically  indicated.  
Both pre -chemotherap y and post -chemotherap y scans must have been performed and be 
readil y available during screening.  Post -chemotherapy  confirmatory  scan for eligibility  must 
be performed within 28 days prior to the date of randomization to assess response status 
following first -line chemotherapy .  This scan will also be used as the baseline scan for the 
tumor assessments in this study .
For all patients, radiological tumor assessments (including chest, abdomen, and pelvic CT or 
MRI  scans) will be conducted at baseline (ie, the post- chemotherap y confirmatory  scan 
within 28 days prior to randomization), at 8 weeks after randomization, then every 
8(±3days) weeks for up to 1 year from randomization, and every  12(±3 day s) weeks 
thereafter until documented disease progression as assessed b y BICR regardless of initiation 
MSB0010718C

Final Protocol Amendment 6, 0 8March 2021
PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL
Page 65of subsequent ant i-cancer therapy .  Additional radiological tumor assessments should also be 
conducted whenever disease progression is suspected (eg, s ymptomatic deterioration).
CR and PR must be confirmed with repeat imaging performed at least 4 weeks after initial 
docume ntation of response.  In the absence of clinical deterioration, patients with PD should 
remain on the current study  treatment until PD is confirmed by  BICR.  Further details 
regarding tumor assessments are provided in Section 7.7.
Measurable or evaluable lesions that have been previously  irradiated will not be considered 
target lesions unless an increase in size has been observed fol lowing completion of radiation 
therap y.
All radiographic images from the time of the most recent tumor assessment prior to first -line 
chemotherap y until documented disease progression will be submitted to an independent 
third- party core imaging laboratory  for Blinded Independent Central Review (BI CR) as 
described in the Stud y Manual.  
All patients’ files and radiologic images must be available for source verification and for 
potential peer review.
As per Protocol Amendment 6, following the final OS update, tumor assessments will be 
performed b y the study  investigator at a frequency  as per local standard of care and when 
progression is suspected. Radiologic images will no longer be submitted for independent 
central review or entered into the CRF .
3.1.3. Safety Asse ssment
Safety  will be monitored at regular intervals throughout the study  by means of laboratory  
tests and clinical visits as described in the Schedule of Activities table. 
3.1.4. Patient -Reported Outcomes 
PROs will be assessed using 2 published and validated instruments, NCCN- FACT FBlSI -18 
and EQ -5D- 5L.
In the treatment of UC, delay  of worsening of s ymptoms and maintenance of QOL is a 
treatment goal with the currentl y available non-curative therapies.57  To that end, Herman et 
al, (2004)58demonstrated that the combination of gemcitab ine with radiation therap y 
maintained overall QOL versus radiation alone, as indicated by the FACT -Bl.  The 
NCCN -FACT FBlSI -18 (a later version of the FACT -Bl) was developed to be part of the 
Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy  (FACIT) sy stem59,60and was specifically  
created with input from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and validated in bladder 
cancer patients.61  The NCCN -FACT FBlSI -18 is designed to be a stand- alone instrument to 
measure s ymptoms and QoL  in patients with UC and was created using inputs from patients 
and oncologists.62  The ‘Disease Related S ymptoms -Physical’ subscale of the NCCN -FACT 
FBlSI -18 (FBlSI -DRS -P), uses a subset of phy sical sy mptoms which are considered to be 
specific to UC.61

Page 66The EuroQol EQ -5D- 5L is a 6 -item patient-completed questionnaire designed to assess 
health status in terms of a single index value or utility  score.63  There are 2 components to the 
EuroQol EQ -5D- 5L, a Health State Profile which has individuals rate their level of problems 
(none, slight, moderate, severe, extreme/unable) in 5 areas (mobilit y, self- care, usual 
activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety /depression), and a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) in 
which patients rate their overall health status from 0 (worst imaginable) to 100 (best 
imaginable).  Published weights are available that allow f or the creation of a single summary  
score.64  Overall scores range from 0 to 1, with low scores representing a higher level of 
dysfunction.  
3.1.5. Pharma cokinetic/Immunogenicity Assessments
Sparse plasma/serum PK/immunogenicity  sampling will be collected for avelumab and anti -
drug antibodies (ADA).  Sampling will only  be done in patients randomized to Arm A.  Refer 
to the Sched ule of Activities table and Sections 7.3 and 7.4for additional details of the PK 
and immunogenicity collections.    
3.1.6. Biomarker Assessments 
Mandatory  baseline (recent) tumor tissue, as well as archival tumor tissue, if available, will 
be collected from all patients to support investigation an d, as appropriate, clinical validation 
of biomarkers that may  predict response to treatment.  End of Treatment tumor tissue from a 
de novo biops y should also be obtained unless clinically contraindicated to support an 
investigation of mechanisms of resista nce.  Banked blood biospecimen will be collected from 
all patients at baseline, on treatment and at End of Treatment/Withdrawal to support 
exploratory  investigation of possible markers predictive of clinical benefit, 
pharmacod ynamic markers and/or markers of intrinsic or acquired resistance. 
Biomarker assessments are described in the Schedule of Activities table and in Section 7.5
and Section 7.6.
4. PATIENT SELECTION
This study  can fulfill its objectives only  if appropriate patients are enrolled.  The following 
eligibility  criteria are designed to select patients for whom participation in the study  is 
considered appropriate.  All relevant medical and non -medical conditions should be taken 
into c onsideration when deciding whether a particular patient is suitable for this protocol.
4.1. Inclusion Criteria

4.3.1. Contraception
Contraception use and pregnancy  test will be evaluated in all patients at screening prior to 
randomization.  However, following assignment to treatment only  patients assigned to 
Arm A (avelumab plus BSC) will be required to remain on contraception as described below.  
In Arm A of this st udy, female patients who are of childbearing potential will receive 
avelumab for which the teratogenic risk is currently  unknown.  
All female patients of childbearing potential who are, in the opinion of the Investigator, 
sexually  active and at risk for pregnancy  must agree to use a highl y effective contraception 
method, preferabl y with low user dependency, during treatment and for at least 30 days after 
the last dose.  The investigator or his or her designee, in consultation with the patient, will 
select an appropriate method of contraception for the individual patient from the list of 
permitted contraception methods (see below), and instruct the patient in its consistent and 
correct use. 
Patients need to affirm that they  meet the criteria for the correct use of the selected method of 
contraception.  At time points indicated in the Schedule of Activities ,the investigator or his 
or her designee will discuss with the patient the need to use the selected contraception 
method cons istently  and correctly  and document such conversation, and the patient’s 
affirmation, in the patient’s chart.  In addition, the investigator or his or her designee will 
instruct the patient to call immediately  if the selected contraception methods are 
discontinued, or if pregnancy  is known or suspected in the patient or to the male patient’s 
partner. 
Contraception Methods
Highl y Effective Methods of Contraception That Have Low User Dependence include the 
following: 
1.Implantable progestogen -only hormonal c ontraception associated with the inhibition 
of ovulation.
2.Intrauterine device (IUD).
3.Intra -uterine hormone -releasing s ystem (IUS).
4.Vasectomized partner.
Vasectomized partner is a highl y effective contraceptive method provided that the 
male partner is the sole sexual partner of the female of child -bearing potential and 
the absence of sperm has been confirmed.  If not, an additional highl y effective 
method o f contraception should be used.  
5.Bilateral tubal occlusion.
MSB0010718C
B9991001
Final Protocol Amendment 6, 0 8March 2021
PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL
Page 72Highl y Effective Methods of Contraception That Are User Dependent include the following: 
1.Combined (estrogen- and progestogen -containing) hormonal contraception associated 
with inhibition of ovulation:
Oral;
Intravaginal;
Transdermal;
Injectable.
2.Progestogen -only hormone contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation:
Oral;
Injectable.
3.Sexual abstinence.  
Sexual abstinence is considered a highl y effective method only  if defined as 
refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk 
associated with the stud y intervention.  The reliability  of sexual abstinence 
needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the trial and the preferred 
and usual lifestyle of the participant.
Female patients of nonchildbearing potential must meet at least 1 of the following criteria:
Have undergone a documented hy sterectomy  and/or bilateral oophorectomy ;
Have medically  confirmed ovarian failure; or 
Achieved postmenopausal status, defined as 60 years or older or no cessation of 
regular menses for at least 12 consecutive months with no alternative pathological 
or phy siological cause.  Status may  be confirmed by  having a serum 
follicle -stimulating hormone (FSH) level test.
All other f emale patients (including females with tubal ligations) will be considered to be of 
childbearing potential.
4.4.Sponsor Qualified Medical Personnel
The contact information for the sponsor's appropriately qualified medical personnel for the 
study  is documented in the study  contact list located in the Study  Manual.
To facilitate access to appropriatel y-qualified medical personnel on study -related medical 
questions or problems, patients are provided with a contact card.  The contact card contains,

Page 73at a minimum, pr otocol and investigational compound identifiers, patient study  numbers, 
contact information for the investigational site, and contact details for a contact center in the 
event that the investigational site staff cannot be reached to provide advice on a med ical 
question or problem originating from another healthcare professional not involved in the 
patient’s participation in the study .  The contact number can also be used by  investigational 
staff if they  are seeking advice on medical questions or problems; h owever it should be used 
only in the event that the established communication pathway s between the investigational
site and the study  team are not available.  It is therefore intended to augment, but not replace 
the established communication pathway s betwe en the investigational site and the study  team 
for advice on medical questions or problems that may  arise during the study.  The contact 
number is not intended for use b y the patient directly, and if a patient calls that number, he or 
she will be directed back to the investigational site.
5.STUDY TREATMENTS
For the purposes of this study , and per International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) 
guidelines, investigational product is defined as a pharmaceutical form of an active 
ingredient or placebo being tested or used as a reference in a clinical trial, including a 
product with a marketing authorization when used or assembled (formulated or packaged) in 
a way  different from the approved form, or when used for an unapproved indication, or when 
used to gain further information about an approved use (ICH E6 1.33).  
For the purpose of this study , the investigational product is avelumab (MSB0010718C).
For the purpose of this study , “study treatment” refers to both the investigational product 
(avelumab) plus BSC and BSC alone administered to patients during participation in this 
study .  Please see Section 5.8for additional information regarding BSC. 
5.1.Allocation to Treatment
The investigator’s knowledge of the treatment should not influence the decision to enroll a 
particular patient or affect the order in which patients are enrolled.
Qualified patients who have signed an Informed Consent Form and meet all eligibility 
criteria will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive avelumab plus BSC (Arm A) or BSC 
alone (Arm B).  Allocation of patients will be stratified according to best response to 
first-line che motherapy  (CR/PR vs. SD) and site of metastases (visceral vs. non -visceral) at 
the time of initiating first -line chemotherap y.  The “non -visceral” stratum includes patients 
with locally -advanced disease as well as patients with only  non-visceral disease.  This 
stratified randomization will be centrally allocated across all centers using an Interactive 
Response Technology  (IRT) sy stem (an interactive web -based response s ystem) .
The site personnel (stud y coordinator or specified designee) will be required to enter or select 
information including but not limited to the user’s identification (ID) and password, the 
protocol number, patient identifiers and demographic information, and stratification factors.   
The site personnel will then be provided with a treatm ent assignment.  The IRT s ystem will 
also provide a confirmation report containing the patient number; this confirmation report 
must be stored in the site’s files.

Final Protocol Amendment 6, 0 8March 2021
PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL
Page 74Study  treatment (C ycle1 Day 1) must start within 3 days after patient randomization.
There is a 24 -hour-a- day, 365 -days-a-year IRT helpdesk available for any questions or 
issues.  The study -specific I RT reference manual will provide the contact information and 
further details on the use of the I RT sy stem. 
Note: The IRT is the source of th e patient number.  The I RT sy stem will provide the patient 
number at the end of the first I RT patient transaction. 
Arm B patients who crossover to receive avelumab plus BSC will be assigned avelumab in 
the IRT s ystem according to instructions provided by  the Sponsor. 
5.2.Patient Compliance with Avelumab Study Treatment
All doses of investigational product will be administered by  the appropriately  designated 
study  staff at the investigational site.  
5.3.Investigational Product Supplies
Avelumab (MSB0010718C) will be supplied for the study  by Pfizer Global Clinical Supply , 
Worldwide Research and Development.  Drug supplies will be shipped to the study  sites with 
a Drug Shipment and Proof of Receipt form.  This form will be completed, filed, and the 
shipment confirm ed as directed on the bottom of the Drug Shipment and Proof of Receipt 
form.  The investigator shall take responsibility for and shall take all steps to maintain 
appropriate records and ensure appropriate suppl y, storage, handling, distribution, and usage 
of investigational product in accordance with the protocol and an y applicable laws and 
regulations.
5.3.1. Avelumab Dosage Form(s) and Packaging
Avelumab is a sterile, clear, and colorless solution intended for IV administration.  Avelumab 
is formulated as a 20.0 mg/mL solution and will be supplied by  the sponsor in single -use 
glass vials, stoppered with a rubber septum and sealed with an aluminum poly propylene 
flip-off seal.
Packaging and labeling will be in accordance with applicable local regulatory  requirement s 
and applicable Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) guidelines.  Avelumab will be packed in 
boxes each containing one vial.  The information on the study treatment will be in 
accordance with approved submission documents. 
Avelumab will be shipped in transp ort cool containers (2 C to 8 C) that are monitored with 
temperature monitoring devices.
5.3.2. Avelumab Preparation and Dispensing
See the Dosage and Administration I nstructions (DAI), which is located in the 
Investigational Product Manual, for instructions on h ow to prepare the investigational 
product for administration. Investigational product should be prepared and dispensed by  an 
appropriatel y qualified and experienced member of the study  staff (eg, phy sician, nurse, 
MSB0010718C
B9991001
Final Protocol Amendment 6, 0 8March 2021
PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL
Page 75physician’s assistant, practitioner, or pharmacist) as allowed by  local, national, and 
institutional guidance.
Only  qualified personnel who are familiar with procedures that minimize undue exposure to 
them and to the environment should undertake the preparation, handling, and safe disposal of 
anticancer agents.
Avelumab will be administered at the investigational site.
The contents of the avelumab vials are sterile and nonpy rogenic, and do not contain 
bacteriostatic preservatives.  Any spills that occur should be cleaned up using the facility’s 
standard cleanup procedures for biologic products.
For administration in this trial, avelumab drug product must be diluted with 0.9% sodium 
chloride (normal saline).  Detailed information on infusion bags and medical devices to be 
used for the preparation of the dilutions and subsequent administration will be provided in 
the DAI.  During avelumab administration, tubing with in -line, low protein binding 
0.2micron filter made with poly ether sulfone (PES) must be used.   
Avelumab must not be used for an y purpo se other than the trial.  The administration of trial 
investigational product to patients who have not been enrolled into the trial is not covered b y 
the trial insurance.
Any unused portion of the solution should be discarded in biohazard waste disposal with 
final disposal by  accepted local and national standards of incineration.
5.4. Avelumab Administration
Avelumab will be administered at the investigational site on an outpatient basis as detailed in 
the DAI.
Avelumab will be administered at 10 mg/kg on Day 1 and Day 15 of each 4 -week treatment 
cycle after all procedures/assessments have been completed as described in the Schedule of 
Activities table.  All safety  assessments must be performed, and results reviewed by  the 
treating physician prior to study  treatment administration.  
Avelumab will be administered as a 1 -hour IV infusion.  I n order to mitigate infusion -related 
reactions, premedication with an antihistamine and with paracetamol (acetaminophen) 
approximately  30 to 60 minutes prior to the first 4 infusions of avelumab is mandatory (for 
example, 25 -50mg diphenhy dramine and 500-650 mg paracetamol [acetaminophen] I V or 
oral equivalent).  Premedication should be administered for subsequent avelumab doses 
based upon clinical judgment and presence/severity  of prior infusion reactions.  The 
premedication regimen may  be modified based on local treatment standards and guidelines, 
as appropriate, provided it does not include sy stemic corticosteroids.  Sites should make 
every  effort to target infusion timing to be as close to 1 hour as possible.  However, given the 
variability  of infusion pumps from site to site, time windows of -10 minutes and +20 minutes 
is permitted (ie, infusion time is 60 minutes: -10min/+20 min).  The exact du ration of 
infusion should be recorded in both source documents and case report forms (CRFs).

Final Protocol Amendment 6, 0 8March 2021
PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL
Page 76Possible modifications of the infusion rate for the management of infusion -related reactions 
are described in Section 5.4.3.2.  
The dose amount required to prepare the avelumab infusion solution will be based on the 
patient’s weight in kilograms (kg).  All patients should be weighed within 3 days prior to 
dosing for every  dose.  If the patient experienced either a weight loss or gain >10% compared 
to the weight used for the last dose calculation, the amount of study  drug required for 
preparation and administration for the current dose must be recalculated using this most 
recent weight obtained.  For weight change less than 10%, the decision to recalculate the 
avelumab dose can be in accordance with institutional practice.  Avelumab dose reduction for 
toxicity  management is not permitted, however the next dose administration may  be omitted 
due to persisting toxicity  as described in Table 3and Section 5.4.3 .
5.4.1. Treatment after Initial Evidence of Radiologic Disease Progression 
Immunotherapeutic agents such as avelumab may  produce anti -tumor effec ts by  potentiating 
endogenous cancer -specific immune responses.  The response patterns seen with such an 
approach may  extend beyond the t ypical time course of responses seen with cytotoxic agents, 
and can manifest as a clinical response after an initial in crease in tumor burden or even the 
appearance of new lesions. 
If radiologic imaging shows disease progression as assessed b y BICR (or as assessed by  
Investigator as per Protocol Amendment 6, following the final OS update), after discussion 
between the Sponsor and I nvestigator, patients may continue to receive avelumab at the 
Investigator’s discretion if the following criteria are met: 
Absence of clinical signs and sy mptoms (including worsening of laboratory  values) 
of disease progression. 
No decline in E COG performance status. 
Absence of rapid progression of disease b y radiographic imaging. 
Absence of progressive tumor at critical anatomical sites (eg, cord compression) 
requiring urgent alternative medical intervention.
Patients who stop avelumab treatm ent, and then experience radiologic disease progression 
thereafter, will be eligible for re- treatment with avelumab at the discretion of the investigator 
and after discussion with the sponsor’s medical monitor if 1) no cancer treatment was 
administered oth er than BSC since the last dose of avelumab, 2) the patient does not meet the 
safet y withdrawal criteria, and 3) the trial is still open.
As per Protocol Amendment 6, following the final OS update, patients who stop avelumab 
treatment and subsequently  expe rience radiologic disease progression, will no longer be 
eligible for re -treatment with avelumab.

Avelumab infusion -related reactions (including hypersensitivity ) and irAEs should be 
handled according to guidelines in Section 5.4.3.2 Management of Avelumab Infusion-
Related Reactions and Section 5.4.3.4 Management of Avelumab Immune -Related Adverse 
Events.
5.4.3.1. Special Precautions for Avelumab Administration
In order to mitigate avelumab infusion-related reactions, premedication with an antihistamine 
and with paracetamol (acetaminophen) approximately  30 to 60 minutes prior to the first 
4infusions of avelumab is mandatory  (for example, 25-50 mg diphenh ydramine and 
500-650 mg paracetamol [acetaminophen] I V or oral equivalent).  Premedication should be 
MSB0010718C
B9991001
Final Protocol Amendment 6, 0 8March 2021
PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL
Page 78administered for subsequent avelumab doses based upon clinical judgement and 
presence/severity  of pri or infusion reactions.  The premedication regimen may  be modified 
based on local treatment standards and guidelines, as appropriate, provided it does not 
include sy stemic corticosteroids. 
As with all monoclonal antibody  therapies, there is a risk of aller gic reactions including 
anaph ylactic shock.  Avelumab should be administered in a setting that allows for immediate 
access to an intensive care unit or equivalent environment and administration of therap y for 
anaph ylaxis, such as the ability  to implement i mmediate resuscitation measures.  Steroids 
(dexamethasone 10 mg), epinephrine (1:1,000 dilution), allergy  medications 
(IVantihistamines), bronchodilators, or equivalents, and oxy gen should be available for 
immediate access.
Infusion of avelumab will be st opped in case of Grade 2 infusion-related, allergic, or 
anaph ylactic reactions.  Sy mptoms of avelumab infusion related reactions include, but are not 
limited to, fever, chills, flushing, h ypotension, d yspnea, wheezing, back pain, abdominal 
pain, and urtic aria.  Management of avelumab infusion related reactions is described in 
Section 5.4.3.2 .  Patients should be instructed to immediately  report to the Investigator any  
delayed reactions that may  occur after they  leave the clinic.
5.4.3.2. Management of Avelumab Infusion -Related Reactions/Hypersensitivity 
Reactions 
Since avelumab is administered IV, infusion -related reactions may  occur (with sy mptoms 
such as fever, chills, rigors, diaphoresis, and headache).  Treatment of the infusion- related 
reaction and modifications of avelumab infusion are mainl y dependent upon severit y, as 
indicated in Table 4. 
Table 4. Treatment Modification for Symptoms of Avelumab Infusion -Related 
Reactions

*If the avelumab infusion rate has been decreased by 50% due to an infusion reaction, it must remain 
decreased for the next scheduled infusion.  If no infusion reaction is observed at the next scheduled infusion, 
at the Investigator’s discretion, the infusion rate may be returned to baseline at subsequent infusions.
Additional Modifications for Patients with Grade 2 Infusion -Related Reactions: In the 
event of a Grade 2infusion- related reaction that does not improve or worsens after 
implementation of the modifications indicated in Table 4(including reducing the infusion 
rate b y 50%), the investigator may  consider treatment with corticosteroids, and the infusion 
should not be resumed for that dose.  At the next dose, the investigator may consider the 
addition of H2 -blocker antihistamines (eg, famotidine or ranitidine), meperidine, o r 
ibuprofen to the mandatory  premedication.  Prophylactic steroids are NOT permitted.
5.4.3.3. Management of Avelumab -Related T umor Lysis Syndrome
Avelumab can induce antibody -dependent cell -mediated cy totoxicity  (ADCC), so there is a 
potential risk of tumor lysis syndrome.  Should this occur, patients should be treated as per 
local guidelines and the management algorithm ( Figure 2) published b y Howard et al.67

Page 885.5.Investigational Product Storage 
The investigator, or an approved representative (eg , pharmacist), will ensure that all 
investigational products are stored in a secured area with controlled access under required 
storage conditions and in accordance with applicable regulatory  requirements. 
Investigational product should be stored in its o riginal container and in accordance with the 
label. See the DAI for storage conditions for avelumab once reconstituted and/or diluted.
Avelumab must be stored in the refrigerator at 2 – 8 C (36 – 46  F).  Do not freeze.  Protect 
from light.  Do not shake vigorousl y.   
Storage conditions stated in the SRSD (ie, Avelumab I nvestigator’s Brochure) will be 
superseded b y the storage conditions stated on the label. 
Site sy stems must be capable of measuring and documenting (for example, via a log), at a 
minimum, daily  minimum and maximum temperatures for all site storage locations (as 
applicable, including frozen, refrigerated and/or room temperature products).  Storage 
temperatures must be captured from the time of investigational product receipt throughout 
the study .  Even for continuous monitoring sy stems, a log or site procedure that ensures 
active dail y evaluation for excursions should be available.  The operation of the temperature 
monitoring device and storage unit (for example, refrigerator), as applicable, must be 
regularl y inspected to ensure it is maintained in working order. 
Any excursions from the product label storage conditions must be reported upon discovery .  
The site should activel y pursue op tions for returning the product to the storage conditions as 
described in the labeling, as soon as possible.  Deviations from the storage requirements, 
including an y actions taken, must be documented and reported to the sponsor. 
Once an excursion is ident ified, the investigational product must be quarantined and not used 
until the sponsor provides documentation of permission to use the investigational product.  It 
will not be considered a protocol deviation if the sponsor approves the use of the 
investigat ional product after the temperature excursion.  Use of the investigational product 
prior to sponsor approval will be considered a protocol deviation.
Specific details regarding information the site should report for each excursion will be 
provided to the site. 
Receipt of materials, door opening and closing, and other routine handling operations where 
the product(s) are briefl y out of the temperature range described in the label are not 
considered excursions. More specific details will be provided to the s ites separately .  
All study  drug supplies must be kept in a locked, limited access room.  The study  drug must 
not be used outside the context of this protocol.  Under no circumstances should the 
investigator or other site personnel suppl y study drug to ot her Investigators, patients, or 
clinics, or allow supplies to be used other than directed b y this protocol without prior 
authorization from the sponsor.  The investigator and or site staff must report any 
unacceptable condition of the investigational product to the site monitor.

Page 895.6.Investigational Product Accountability 
The investigative site must maintain adequate records documenting the receipt, use, loss, or 
other disposition of the investigational product supplies.  The sponsor will provide 
instructions as to disposition of any unused investigational product if the investigative site is 
unable to destro y at site per local procedures. 
The investigative site must maintain adequate records documenting the receipt, use, loss, or 
other disposition of the inve stigational product -supplies.   
Pfizer may  suppl y drug accountability forms that must be used or may approve use of 
standard institution forms.  I n either case, the forms must identify  the investigational product, 
including batch or code numbers, and accou nt for its disposition on a patient -by-patient basis, 
including specific dates and quantities. 
The prescribed dose must be recorded in the patient’s medical records.  Drug dispensing 
needs to be verified and documented b y a second individual and the forms must be signed b y 
both the individual who dispensed the drug and the second individual who verified the 
dispensing.  Copies must be provided to Pfizer. 
5.7. Destruction of Investigational Product Supplies 
At the end of the trial, or at appropriate points dur ing the trial, Pfizer or designee will provide 
instructions as to disposition of an y unused investigational product.  If Pfizer or designee 
authorizes destruction at the trial site, the investigator must ensure that the materials are 
destroy ed in complianc e with applicable environmental regulations, institutional policy , and 
any special instructions provided by  Pfizer.  All destruction must be adequately  documented.  
If drug destruction is not permitted locally , Pfizer should be contacted for further direct ions.
5.8.Best Supportive Care
All patients will receive BSC during this study.  BSC will be prescribed and/or administered 
per current treatment practices at each investigational site and per individual patient needs 
and could include treatment with antibiotics, nutritional support, correction of metabolic 
disorders, optimal symptom control and pain management (including radiotherapy ), etc.  
BSC does not include any  active anti -tumor therapy ; however, local radiotherapy  of isolated 
lesions with pallia tive intent is acceptable as described in Section 5.9.2 .  
AllBSC components must comply  with the permitted medications described in this protocol 
(see Section 5.9).
5.9. Concomitant Treatments
Medications or vaccinations specificall y prohibited in the Exclusion Criteria are also not 
allowed during the active treatment period, except for administration of inactivated vaccines .
If there is a clinical indication for one of these or other medications or vaccinations 
specificall y prohibited during the trial, dis continuation from study  therapy  or 
medication/vaccination may  be required.  The final decision on any  supportive therapy  or

PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL
Page 90vaccination rests with the investigator and/or the patient’s primary  physician.  However, the 
decision to continue the patient on st udy therapy  or medication/vaccination schedule requires 
the mutual agreement of the investigator, the sponsor, and the patient. 
Concomitant treatment considered necessary  for the patient’s well- being may  be given at the 
discretion of the treating physicia n.
Concomitant medications, blood products, non- drug interventions, and treatments, including 
herbal supplements, will be recorded from 28 days prior to the start of study treatment and up 
to 90 days after the last dose of study  treatment (Arm A) or 90 day s after the End of 
Treatment (EOT) visit (Arm B).  
All concomitant medications will be recorded in the CRF including supportive care drugs 
(eg, antiemetic treatment and proph ylaxis) and the drugs used to treat adverse events or 
chronic diseases, and non -drug supportive interventions (eg, transfusions).  During stud y 
treatment, concomitant medications should be reviewed at each stud y visit, and an y 
prohibited treatments should be discussed and appropriatel y managed.
Given that recording of non- serious AEs e nds when a patient begins a new anti -cancer 
therap y (Section 8.2), recording of concomitant medications associated with these non -
serious AEs should also end.  However, given that SAEs must continue to be recorded up to 
90 day s after the last dose of study  treatment(s) even if the patient begins a new anti- cancer 
thera py, concomitant medications associated with these SAEs must also be recorded. 
As per Protocol Amendment 6, following the final OS update, concomitant 
medications/treatments will not be captured in the CRF unless they  contribute to or are 
associated with t he treatment for an AE. 
Concurrent anticancer therapy with agents is not allowed, other than avelumab in patients 
randomized to Arm A.  Medications intended solely  for supportive care (ie, antiemetics, 
analgesics, megestrol acetate for anorexia) are allow ed.
Recommended medications to treat infusion- related reactions, hy persensitivity  reactions and 
flu-like sy mptoms, tumor ly sis sy ndrome, and irAE are reported in Sections 5.4.3.2 , 5.4.3.3, 
and 5.4.3.4 , respectivel y. 
5.9.1. Concomitant Surgery 
In the case that a surgical procedure is required for palliative care, all attempts should be 
made to rule out disease progression beforehand.  
In the case of a surgical procedure, avelumab treatment should be withheld.   Postoperatively , 
the decision to reinitiate avelumab treatment should be discussed with the sponsor’s medical 
monitor. 
5.9.2. Concomitant Radiotherapy
Local radiotherap y of isolated lesions with palliative intent is acceptable (eg, bleeding, pain, 
compression) , however all attempts should be made to rule out disease progression.  
MSB0010718C

Final Protocol Amendment 6, 0 8March 2021
PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL
Page 91Palliative radiotherap y is permitted if considered medically  necessary  by the treating 
physician.  If palliative radiotherap y is needed to control pain, the site(s) of disease causing 
pain should also be present at baseline; otherwise, painful lesion(s) requiring radiotherap y 
will be considered as a sign of disease progression. 
5.9.3. Other Prohibited Concomitant Medications and Therapies 
All patients are prohibited from receiving the follow ing therapies while receiving stud y 
treatment:
Anti- cancer s ystemic chemotherapy  or biological therapy or investigational agents 
other than avelumab. 
Other experimental pharmaceutical products.
Patients enrolled on Arm A are prohibited from receiving the following therapies while 
receiving stud y treatment:
Immunotherap y, immunosuppressive drugs (ie, chemotherap y or s ystemic 
corticosteroids except for short term treatment of allergic reactions or for the 
treatment of irAEs).  Short term administration of sy stemic steroids (eg, for allergic 
reactions or the management of irAEs) is allowed.  I ntranasal, inhaled, topical 
steroids, or local steroid injections (eg, intra-articular injection) are allowed.
Any vaccine therapies for the prevention of infectious dise ase within 4 weeks of start 
of study  treatment, except for inactivated vaccines (eg, influenza vaccine). 
Bisphosphonate or denosumab treatment unless it has been initiated more than 
14days prior to receiving the first administration of avelumab.  
Growth factors (granulocy te colony  stimulating factor or granulocy te macrophage 
colony  stimulating factor). Exception: Ery thropoietin and darbepoietin alpha may  be 
prescribed at the investigator’s discretion).
Herbal remedies with immunostimulating proper ties (eg, mistle toe extract) or known 
to potentially  interfere with major organ function (eg, h ypericin).
Clarifications About Steroid Use : Data indicate that corticosteroids have an adverse effect 
on T- cell function and that they  inhibit and damage ly mphocytes.68,69  Furthermore, as with 
allimmunotherapies intended to augment cell -mediated immunity , there is a risk that 
concomitant immunosuppressives such as steroids will counteract the intended benefit of the 
proposed study  treatment.  However, studies with anti -CTL A4 agents indicate that short -term 
use of steroids may  be employ ed without compromising clinical outcomes.70  Therefore, the 
use of steroids during this trial is restricted as follows for patients receiving avelumab:

PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL
Page 92Therapeutic use: for the treatment of infusion -related reactions and short -term 
treatment of irAEs, steroids are permitted according to the modalities indicated in 
Table 5.
Physiologic use: steroid replacement for adrenal insufficiency  at doses equivalent to 
10mg prednisone daily is acceptable.
Prophy lactic use, eg, for the prevention of acute infusion -related reactions, i s 
prohibited, except prophy lactic use prior to CT or MRI .
Intranasal, inhaled, topical steroids, or local steroid injections (eg, intra-articular
injection) are permitted .
5.10. Rescue Medications and Supportive Care 
5.10.1. Supportive Care Guidelines 
Patients should receive appropriate supportive care measures as deemed necessary b y the 
treating investigator including but not limited to the items outlined below: 
Diarrhea: All patients who experience diarrhea should be advised to drink liberal 
quantiti es of clear fluids.  If sufficient oral fluid intake is not feasible, fluid and 
electrol ytes should be substituted via I V infusion.
Nausea/Vomiting: Nausea and vomiting should be treated aggressivel y, and 
consideration should be given in subsequent cy cles to the administration of 
prophy lactic antiemetic therapy  according to standard institutional practice.  Patients 
should be strongl y encouraged to maintain liberal oral fluid intake. 
Anti- infectives: Patients with a documented infectious complication shoul d receive 
oral or IV antibiotics or other anti -infective agents as considered appropriate by  the 
treating investigator for a given infectious condition, according to standard 
institutional practice.  Prophy lactic administration should be considered for the cases 
outlined in Table 5.
Anti- inflammatory  or narcotic analgesics may  be offered as needed.  
Acetaminophen/paracetamol to a maximum total daily  dose of 2 g is perm itted.  Daily  
intake over 2 g is prohibited for patients receiving avelumab.
Patients who need to be on anticoagulant therap y during treatment should be treated 
with low molecular weight heparin.  If low molecular weight heparin cannot be 
administered, cou madin or other coumarin derivatives or other anti- coagulants 
(including direct factor Xa inhibitors) may  be allowed; however, appropriate 
monitoring of prothrombin time/international normalized ratio (PT/I NR) should be 
performed.

6.1.Screeni ng
For screening procedures, see Schedule of Activities (SOA) table and Assessments section 
(Section 7).  
6.1.1. Tumor Biospecimens
Provision of a tumor biospecimen will be required for randomization into the study  as 
follows:
1.Recent tumor biospecimen: A mandatory  FFPE tumor tissue block (or subsection 
thereof) must be obtained f rom all patients representing tumor tissue from the most 
recent primary  or metastatic tumor biopsy  or resection obtained prior to treatment 
with first line chemotherapy but within 24 months prior to randomization, with no 
intervening s ystemic anti- cancer t herap y between the time the tissue was obtained 
and initiation of first -line chemotherap y.  If an FFPE tissue block cannot be provided 
due to local regulation or policy , 15 freshl y cut unstained slides (10 minimum) will be 
acceptable.  
Tumor tissue from cytologic sampling (eg, fine needle aspiration, including FFPE cell 
pellet material) or bone metastases is not adequate and should not be submitted.  I f a 
suitable tissue sample is not otherwise available, then an FFPE tissue sample from a 
de novo biops y (core needle or excisional) must be obtained for research purposes 
during the screening period for this study  (after informed consent has been obtained 
and prior to randomization).  
Note: This mandatory  tumor tissue sample must be submitted to the Central 
Laboratory prior to randomization.  
2. Archival tumor biospecimen: An archival FFPE tumor tissue block (or subsection 
thereof) collected at the time of primary  diagnosis or first tumor resection (if different 
from the most recent sample described above) is s trongl y encouraged to assess 
changes in the tumor microenvironment relative to the most recent sample (per 
above).  If an FFPE tissue block cannot be provided, 15 unstained slides 
(10minimum) will be acceptable.  A sample from a later timepoint that is st ill prior to 
the most recent tumor tissue sample (per above) may  be substituted, if necessary .  
Tumor tissue from cy tologic samples (eg, FFPE cell pellet from Fine Needle 
Aspiration biopsy ) or bone metastases are not acceptable.  
End of Treatment Tumor Bi ospecimen: A de novo tumor sample (ie, fresh biopsy ) should 
also be collected at End of Treatment unless clinically  contraindicated.  This denovo biopsy  
should be formalin- fixed and paraffin -embedded as per routine procedures (see Laboratory  
Manual), and the resulting FFPE tissue block(s) should be submitted to the Central 
Laboratory .  If an FFPE tissue block cannot be provided, 15 freshl y cut unstained slides 
(10minimum) will be acceptable.

information on tumor biospecimen collection procedures is included in the Laboratory  
Manual.
6.2.Treatment Perio d
For treatment period procedures, see Schedule of Activities table and Assessments section 
(Section 7).  Patients who refuse to return to the site for evaluations should be contacted by  
telephone every  3 months as an alternative to site visits, as all patients will be followed for 
survival until death, end of the study , orpatient withdrawal of consent, whichever comes 
first.
As per Protocol Amendment 6, following the final OS update, only  patients receiving 
avelumab will continue in the treatment phase of this study . All Arm B patients who have not 
crossed over to receive avelumab and are still in the treatment phase will be discontinued.  
Please refer to the “Protocol Amendment 6: Schedule of Activities for Study Treatment, End 
of Treatment and Follow -up Periods” for stud y procedures to be performed for patients 
continuing to receive avelumab. 
6.3. End of Treatment/Withdrawal and Follow- up Visits
For follow -up procedures, see Schedule of Activities and Assessments section ( Section 7). 
Beyond the 90 day s until the end of the study  (long -term follow -up), all patients will be 
followed every  3 months after the last study  clinic visit ( 14 day s) for survival, tumor 
assessment, and new s ystemic anticancer treatment; additional timepoints to collect survival 
information may  be requested by  the Sponsor in preparation for interim and final anal yses.
As per Protocol Amendment 6, following the final OS update, only  patients who received 
avelumab will be followed through the 90 -day Short- term Follow -up Visit.  Patients who are 
receiving or have received BSC alone and are in the treatment or 90 -day Short- term Follow -
up phase will be discontinued with no further follow -up.  No additional OS f ollow -up will be 
performed for anystudy  patient.
6.4.End of the Study
The study  will end when at least 425 and 219 OS events have occurred for all randomized 
patients and patients with PD- L1-positive tumors, respectivel y.
At the end of stud y, patients receivi ng avelumab plus BSC who are still deriving clinical 
benefit from the stud y treatment will be provided with an option for continued study 
treatment (eg, rollover study ).
6.5.Patient Withdrawal
Patients may  withdraw from treatment at an y time at their own reque st, or they  may  be 
withdrawn at an y time at the discretion of the investigator or sponsor for safety or behavioral 
reasons, or the inability  of the patient to comply  with the protocol- required schedule of study  
visits or procedures at a given stud y site.

PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL
Page 95Reasons for withdrawal of study  treatment may  include:
Confirmed disease progression as assessed b y BICR (or as assessed b y Investigator as 
per Protocol Amendment 6, following the final OS update).  However, patients 
receiving avelumab with disease progr ession who are continuing to derive clinical 
benefit from stud y treatment will be eligible to continue with avelumab, provided that 
the treating ph ysician has determined that the benefit/risk for doing so is favorable 
(see Section5.4.1 );
Global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation;
Unacceptable toxicity ;
Pregnancy ;
Significant protocol violation;
Lost to follow -up;
Patient refused further treatment (follow -up permitted by  patient);
Study  terminated by  sponsor;
Death.
Reasons for withdrawal from study  follow -up may include:
Study  terminated by  sponsor;
Lost to follow -up;
Refused further follow -up;
Death.
If a patient does not return for a scheduled visit, every  effort should be made to contact the 
patient.  All attempts to contact the patient and information received during contact attempts 
must be documented in the patient’s medical record.  In an y circumstanc e, every  effort 
should be made to document patient outcome, if possible.  The investigator should inquire 
about the reason for withdrawal, request the patient to return all unused investigational 
product(s), request that the patient return for a final visit, if applicable, and follow up with 
the patient regarding an y unresolved AEs.
If the patient withdraws from the study , and also withdraws consent for disclosure of future 
information, no further evaluations should be performed, and no additional data should be 
collected.  The sponsor may  retain and continue to use any  data collected before such 
withdrawal of consent.

Page 967.ASSESSMENTS
Every effort should be made to ensure that the protocol required tests and procedures are 
completed as described.  However, it is anticipated that from time to time there may  be 
circumstances, outside of the control of the investigator, which may  make it un feasible to 
perform the test.  In these cases, the investigator will take all steps necessary  to ensure the 
safet y and well -being of the patient.  When a protocol -required test cannot be performed, the 
investigator will document the reason for this and any corrective and preventive actions 
which he or she has taken to ensure that normal processes are adhered to as soon as possible.  
The sponsor’s stud y team will be informed of these incidents in a timely fashion.
7.1.Safety Assessment
Safety  assessments will include collection of AEs, Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), vital 
signs, ph ysical examination, laboratory  assessments (including pregnancy  tests), and 
verification of concomitant medications.  Further details of these assessments are described 
in the Schedule of Activities.  
7.1.1. Pregnancy Testing
For female patients of childbearing potential, a serum pregnancy  test, with sensitivity  of at 
least 25 mIU/mL , will be performed on 2 occasions prior to starting stud y treatment: once at 
the start of screening, and once at the C ycle 1 Day 1 visit for Arm A patients immediately  
before the administration of study  treatment.  Following a negative pregnancy  test result at 
screening, appropriate contraception must be commenced and another negative p regnancy  
test result will then be required at the C ycle 1 Day 1 visit before the patient may  receive 
avelumab study  treatment.  For patients receiving avelumab study  treatment, serum or urine 
pregnancy  tests will also be routinely  repeated as described in the Schedule of Activities
tables and additionally whenever 1 menstrual cy cle is missed or when potential pregnancy  is 
otherwise suspected.  In the case of a positive human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) test, the 
patient will be withdrawn from treatment but may remain in the study . 
Additional pregnancy  tests may  also be undertaken if requested by  Institutional Review 
Board/Ethics Committees (I RB/ECs) or if required by  local regulations.
As per Protocol Amendment 6, following th e final OS update, negative pregnancy  test results 
need not be recorded in the CRF.
7.1.2. Adverse Events
Assessment of adverse events will include the ty pe, incidence, severity  (graded by  NCI 
CTCAE version 4.03, Appendix 3), timing, seriousness, and relatedness.  Adverse events that 
occur during the study will be recorded on the adverse events CRF page.
7.1.3. Laboratory Safety Assessments
Hematology , blood chemistry , and urinaly sis will be collected at the time points described in 
the Schedule of Activities and anal yzed at local laboratories.  They  may  also be performed

Physical examinations will be performed according to institutional guidelines on study  days 
as described in the Schedule of Activities .  
The phy sical examination will include major body  systems, height (height will be measured 
at screening onl y), and assessment of ECOG performance status.
Vital signs (blood pressure and pulse rate) and weight will be measured on study  days as 
described in the Schedule of Activities.  Bl ood pressure and pulse rate should be taken prior 
to study  drug dosing (if applicable) and with the patient in the seated position  after the 
patient has been sitting quietly  for at least 5 minutes.

Page 997.1.5. (12-Lead) Electrocardiograms
A standard 12 lead (with a 10 sec ond rh ythm strip) tracing will be used for all 
electrocardiogram (ECG) assessments.   
All patients require a single ECG measurement at screening (clinicall y significant abnormal 
findings in baseline ECGs will be recorded as medical history ).  On -treatment ECGs will be 
performed as clinicall y indicated. 
Clinically  significant new findings seen on subsequent ECGs should be recorded as adverse 
events.  In case of QTc >500 msec (ie, > CTCAE Grade 2), ECG must be reviewed b y 
qualified personnel at the site as soon as the finding is made, including verify ing that the 
machine reading is accurate.  If the manual reading verifies a rate corrected QTc of 
>500 msec, repeat ECG should be immediately  performed at least two times approximately  
2to 4 minutes apart. 
An electronic reading of prolonged QTc must be confirmed b y manual reading.  Prior to 
concluding that an episode of prolongation of the QTc interval is due to study  drug, thorough 
consideration should be given to potential precipitating factors (eg, change in patient clinical 
condition, effect of concurrent medication, electroly te disturbance) and possible evaluation 
by specialist.  If QTc interval reverts to less than 500 msec, and in the judgment of 
investigator and sponsor is determined to be due to a cause other than study  drug, treatment 
may be continued with regular ECG monitoring.
If patient experiences a cardiac or neurologic AE (specificall y syncope, dizziness, seizures, 
or stroke) triplicate ECGs should be obtained at time of the event.  If the mean Q Tc is 
prolonged (>500 msec), the ECGs should be re -evaluated b y a qualified person at the 
institution for confirmation and repeated as clinically  indicated.
As per Protocol Amendment 6, following the final OS update, ECG results need not be 
recorded in the CRF unless the findings support an AE.  
7.2.Patient -Reported Outcome Assessments
The NCCN -FACT FBlSI -18 and EQ -5D-5L questionnaires will be administered at time 
points described in the Schedule of Activities.  The amount of time for a patient to complete 
the questionnaire is estimated to be about 3 -5minutes. 
As per Protocol Amendment 6, following the final OS update, Patient -Reported Outcome 
Assessments will no longer be performed/collected.  
7.3.Pharmacokinetics Assessments
Blood samples (3.5 mL serum separator (SST) tube per timepoint) for PK analy ses will be 
collected from Arm A patients as outlined in the Schedule of Activities table.  Do not collect 
blood from the same arm being infused.  Where noted in the Schedule of Activities, PK 
blood samples will be collected at approximately  the same time as other assessments 
wherever possible.

Final Protocol Amendment 6, 0 8March 2021
PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL
Page 100For all PK blood sample collections, the actual time of avelumab dosing, as well as actu al 
times of PK collections, will be recorded in the source document and CRF.
In addition to PK blood samples collected at the scheduled times, additional PK blood 
samples for avelumab should be collected from patients experiencing unexpected and/or 
serious AEs.  The date and time of blood sample collection and of the last dose of study  
treatment prior to PK collection must be documented in the CRF.
All efforts will be made to obtain the PK blood samples at the scheduled nominal time 
relative to dosing.  How ever, samples obtained within 10% of the nominal time (eg, within 
6minutes of a 60 -minute sample) will be considered protocol compliant, and the exact time 
of the sample collection noted on the CRF.  If a scheduled PK blood sample collection 
cannot be com pleted for any  reason, the missed sample collection may  be rescheduled with 
agreement of the investigator and sponsor.
PK blood samples will be assay ed for avelumab using validated anal ytical methods.  
Additional details regarding the collection, processin g, storage, and shipping of the blood 
samples will be provided in the study  manual.  As part of the understanding of the PK of the 
study  drug, samples may  be used for further evaluation of the bioanal ytical methods for 
avelumab.  The results of such anal yses may  be included in the clinical report.
As per Protocol Amendment 6, following the final OS update, the collection of PK blood 
samples will no longer be performed/collected.  
7.4.Immunogenicity Assessment
Blood samples (3.5 mL SST tube per timepoint) for e valuation of avelumab immunogenicit y 
will be collected from Arm A patients as outlined in the Schedule of Activities table.  
Immunogenicit y blood samples will be assayed for anti avelumab antibodies using a 
validated anal yticalmethod.  All samples should be drawn within 2 hours before the start of 
avelumab infusion.  All of the samples that are positive for ADA may  also undergo 
characterization for neutralizing antibodies.  Additional details regarding the collection, 
processin g, storage, and shipping of the blood samples will be provided in the Study  Manual.
As per Protocol Amendment 6, following the final OS update, the collection of 
immunogenicit y blood samples will no longer be performed/collected.  
7.5.Translational and Pharma codynamic Assessments
7.5.1. Archived Tumor Biospecimens and De Novo Tumor Biopsies
Tumor biospecimens (see Section 6.1.1) will be used to analyze candidate DNA, RNA, or 
protein markers, or relevant signatures of markers for their ability  to identify  those patients 
who are most likely to benefit from treatment with the study drugs. 
Tumor tissue biomarker status will be determined by  analytically validated tests developed 
by the sponsor; tumor tissue biomarkers anal yzed may  include, but may  not necessarily  be 
limited to, PD -L1 expression and quantitation of tumor -infiltrating CD8+ T- lymphocy tes by  
IHC.  Optional tumor biopsies obtained at the End of Treatment/Withdrawal will be assessed

Page 101to the pre -treatment biopsies (archival or de novo ) to investigate acquired mechanisms of 
resistance.  
Only  core needle or excisional biopsies, or resection specimen are suitable.  Cy tologic 
preparation s, such as fine needle aspiration biopsies, are not acceptable.  Additional 
information on tissue collection procedures can be found in the Study  Manual.
7.5.2. Peripheral Blood
Specimens will be retained as banked biospecimens (see Section 7.6) and will include whole 
blood, serum and plasma samples that will be retained in a biobank for exploratory  
assessments, unless prohibited by  local regulation or by  decision of the Institution al Review 
Board or Ethics Committee.  Samples may  be used to identify  or characterize cells, DNA, 
RNA, or protein markers known or suspected to be of relevance to the mechanisms of action, 
or the development of resistance to study  treatment.  These include biomarkers that may  aid 
in the identification of those patients who might preferentiall y benefit from treatment with 
avelumab plus BSC vs. BSC alone, including but not limited to biomarkers related to 
anti-tumor immune response or target modulation, such as soluble IL -8 or IFN , and/or tissue 
FoxP3, PD -1, PD -L2. 
As per Protocol Amendment 6, following the final OS update, the collection of biomarkers 
will no longer be performed/collected.  
7.6.Banked Biospecimens
7.6.1. Markers of Drug Response
Study ing the variation in genetic markers and other biomarkers may  help to explain some of 
the variability  in response seen with some drugs among different individuals.  This is referred 
to as pharmacogenomic/biomarker research.  Comparing the DNA, RNA, protein, and 
metabolite variation patterns of patients who respond well and those who respond poorly  to 
treatment may  help to better define the most appropriate group of patients in which to target a 
given treatment.  Collecting biospecimens for exploratory  pharmacogenomic/bioma rker 
analyses and retaining them in the Pfizer BioBank makes it possible to better understand the 
drug’s mechanism of action and to seek explanations for differences in, for example, 
exposure, efficacy , tolerability , or safet y not anticipated prior to the beginning of the stud y.  
Providing these biospecimens is a required stud y activity  for study  sites and patients, unless 
prohibited as such b y local regulations or ethics committee decision. 
To protect patients’ confidentiality , the banked biospecimens and data generated from them 
will be coded with the patient’s study  ID number.  Samples will be kept in a facilit y 
accessible only  by swiping a badge.  Data will be stored on password- protected computer 
systems.  The key  between the code and the patient’s per sonal identifiers will be held at the 
study  site; the researchers using the biospecimens and data generated from them will not 
have access to the key  nor any  personally  identify ing information.  Biospecimens will be 
used only  for the purposes described her e and in the informed consent document/patient 
information sheet; an y other uses require additional ethical approval.  Unless a time 
limitation is required by  local regulations or ethical requirements, biospecimens will be

PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL
Page 102stored indefinitely to allow for future research on the topics described here, including 
research conducted during the drug development process and also postmarketing research.  
Patients can withdraw their consent for the use of their biospecimens at an y time by  making a 
request to the in vestigator, in which case any  remaining biospecimen will be destroy ed; data 
alread y generated from the biospecimens will continue to be stored to protect the integrit y of 
existing analy ses.  It is very unlikely  that results generated from the biospecimens will have 
any clinical, diagnostic, or therapeutic implications for the individual study  participants.  
Patients are notified in the informed consent document/patient information sheet that their 
results will not be given to them, unless required by local laws or regulations, in which case 
results will be returned via the investigator.  Results will not be provided to family  members 
or other ph ysicians, nor will they  be recorded in the patient’s medical record.  There is no 
intention to contact patients aft er completion of the clinical study .
A single 4mL blood biospecimen Prep D1 (K2edetic acid [ethylenediaminetetraacetic 
acid, EDTA] whole blood collection optimized for DNA analysis) will be collected on or 
prior to the Cy cle1 Day 1 visit (prior to dosin g for Arm A patients and at any  time for 
Arm B patients) to be retained for potential pharmacogenomic/biomarker analy ses related to 
drug response, unless prohibited by  local regulations or ethics committee decision.  For 
example, putative safet y biomarkers , drug -metabolizing enzyme genes, drug -transport 
protein genes, or genes thought to be related to the mechanism of drug action may  be 
examined.
Additional biospecimens to be retained for exploratory  anal yses in this study , as described in 
Section 7.6.2 , include the following: 
Prep D1 (K2EDTA whole blood collection optimized for DNA analy sis): A 4 mL 
blood biospecimen will be collect ed on or prior to Cy cle1 Day 1; Cy cle1 Day 15 
(Arm A onl y); Da y1 of Cy cles2, 3, and 5; and at the End of Treatment/Withdrawal 
Visit.  All collections must be pre -dose.
Prep B2 (serum collection optimized for biomarker/proteomic/metabonomic 
analysis) : A10mL blood biospecimen will be collected on or prior to C ycle1 Day 1; 
Cycle1 Day 15 (Arm A only ); Day 1 of C ycles 2, 3, and 5; and at the End of 
Treatment/Withdrawal Visit.  All collections must be pre- dose.
Prep B1 (EDTA plasma collection optimized fo r biomarker/proteomic/
metabonomic analysis) : A 10 -mL blood biospecimen will be collected on or prior to 
Cycle1 Day 1; Cy cle1 Day 15 (Arm A onl y); Day 1 of Cy cles2, 3, and 5; and at the 
End of Treatment/Withdrawal Visit.  All collections must be pre -dose.
The banked biospecimens will be collected from all patients unless prohibited by local 
regulations or ethics committee decision.   Detailed collection, processing, storage, and 
shipment instructions are provided in the central laboratory manual.

Page 103It is possible that the use of these biospecimens may  result in commercially viable products.  
Patients will be advised in the informed consent document/patient information sheet that they  
will not be compensated in this event.
7.6.2. Additional Research
Unless prohibi ted by  local regulations or ethics committee decision, patients will be asked to 
indicate on the consent form whether they  will allow the banked biospecimens to also be 
used for the following research:
Investigations of the disease under stud y in the clini cal study , and related conditions.
Biospecimens may  be used as controls.  This includes use in case -control studies of 
diseases for which Pfizer is researching drug therapies; use in characterizing the 
natural variation amongst people in genes, RNA, protei ns, and metabolites; and use in 
developing new technologies related to pharmacogenomics/biomarkers. 
Patients need not provide additional biospecimens for the uses described in this section; the 
biospecimens specified in the Markers of Drug Response section will be used.  Patients may  
still participate in the clinical study  if they  elect not to allow their Banked Biospecimens to 
be used for the additiona l purposes described in this section.
7.7.Tumor Assessments
Tumor assessments will include all known or suspected disease sites.  Imaging will include 
chest, abdomen, and pelvis CT or MRI  scans.  Bone imaging, eg, bone scans or other 
methods considered standar d of care locall y, such as 18FDG PET or MRI , are required at 
baseline (28 day screening period).  ( Note : 18FDG -PET may  not be a permissible alternate 
for bone imaging at some centers or countries (eg, investigative sites in Canada).)  Bone 
lesion(s) identi fied at baseline by  bone scan will be further assessed by  CT or MRI  as per 
local practice (where bone scans are not used as a routine restaging tool) and subsequently  
re-assessed by  CT or MRI as per the tumor assessment schedule as an alternative to bone 
scans.  Bone imaging will only  be repeated during study  as clinically  indicated (eg, patient 
describes new or worsening bone pain, or has increasing alkaline phosphatase level, or other 
signs and s ymptoms of new/progressing bone metastases), at the time of complete response 
(CR) confirmation, and at every  other tumor assessment visit (ie, every  16weeks for the first 
year after randomization and every  24 weeks thereafter) if considered local standard of care.  
Brain imaging (eg, MRI) is required at baseline for patients who have a history  of brain 
metastases or for whom brain metastases are suspected during screening.  Brain must be 
included in subsequent tumor assessments if a patient has brain metastases at baseline; 
otherwise brain will only be evaluated when clinically  indicated.
The CT and MRI scans should be performed with contrast agents unless contraindicated for 
medical reasons.  The same imaging technique used to characterize each identified and 
reported lesion at baseline will be employ ed in the fo llowing tumor assessments.

Page 104Both pre -chemotherap y and post -chemotherap y scans must have been performed and be 
readil y available during screening.  The post -chemotherap y confirmatory scan for eligibility 
must be performed within 28 days prior to the date of randomization to assess response status 
following first -line chemotherapy .  This scan will also be used as the baseline scan for tumor 
assessments in this study .
All radiographic images from the time of the most recent tumor assessment prior to first -line 
chemotherap y until documented disease progression will be submitted to an independent 
third- party core imaging laboratory  for BI CR as described in Study  Manual.  
For all patients, anti -tumor activity  will be assessed through radiological tumor assessments
(including chest, abdomen, and pelvic CT or MRI scans) conducted at baseline (ie, the 
post-chemotherap y confirmatory  scan for randomization), every  8weeks up to 1 year after 
randomization, and every 12 weeks thereafter until documented disease progressio n as 
assessed b y BICR regardless of initiation of subsequent anti -cancer therap y.  Additional 
radiological tumor assessments should also be conducted whenever disease progression is 
suspected (eg, symptomatic deterioration).
Assessment of response will be made using RECIST version 1.1 ( Appendix 2).  Measurable 
or evaluable lesions that have been previousl y irradiated will not be considered target les ions 
unless an increase in size has been observed following completion of radiation therapy .
CR and PR must be confirmed with repeat imaging performed at least 4 weeks after initial 
documentation of response.  In the absence of clinical deterioration, pati ents with PD should 
remain on the current study  treatment until PD is confirmed by  BICR.  For Arm A patients, 
please see Section 5.4.1 regarding continued avelumab study  treatment after initial evidence 
of disease progression.
All patients’ files and radiologic images must be available for source verification and for 
potential peer review.
As per Protocol Amendment 6, following the fi nal OS update, tumor assessments will be 
performed b y the study  investigator at a frequency  as per local standard of care and when 
progression is suspected.  Radiologic images will no longer be submitted for independent 
central review or entered into the C RF.
7.8. Expedited Blinded Independent Central Review for Disease Progression
Prior to implementation of Protocol Amendment 6 and the final OS update, to mitigate the 
potential for bias in determining disease progression, expedited BI CR will be performed for 
investigator -assessed disease progression.  Upon investigator- assessed disease progression, 
all radiographic images collected for a patient from baseline onwards will be submitted to the 
BICR for expedited review.  See the Study Manual for process details.  Every  effort should 
be made to keep the patient on study  treatment until the BI CR has completed their imaging 
review.

Page 1058.ADVERSE EVENT REPORT ING
8.1.Adverse Events
All observed or volunteered AEs regardless of treatment group or suspected causal 
relationship to the study  treatment(s) will be reported as described in the following sections. 
For all AEs, the investigator must pursue and obtain information adequate both to determine 
the outcome of the AE and to assess whether it meets the criteria for classificatio n as a 
serious adverse event (SAE) requiring immediate notification to Pfizer or its designated 
representative.  For all AEs, sufficient information should be obtained by  the investigator to 
determine the causality  of the AE.  The investigator is required to assess causality .  
Follow -up by  the investigator may  be required until the event or its sequelae resolve or 
stabilize at a level acceptable to the investigator, and Pfizer concurs with that assessment.
As part of ongoing safet y reviews conducted b y the sponsor, an y non -serious adverse event 
that is determined b y the sponsor to be serious will be reported b y the sponsor as an SAE.  To 
assist in the determination of case seriousness, further information may  be requested from the 
investigator to provide cla rity and understanding of the event in the context of the clinical 
study . 
8.2.Reporting Period
For SAEs, the active reporting period to Pfizer or its designated representative begins from 
the time that the patient provides informed consent, which is obtained prior to the patient’s 
participation in the study , ie, prior to undergoing any  study -related procedure and/or 
receiving stud y treatment, through and including 90 calendar days after the last 
administration of the study  treatment (Arm A) or 90 day s after th e EOT visit (Arm B).  SAEs 
occurring to a patient after the active reporting period has ended should be reported to the 
sponsor if the investigator becomes aware of them; at a minimum, all SAEs that the 
investigator believes have at least a reasonable poss ibility  of being related to study  treatment 
are to be reported to the sponsor. 
AEs (serious and non -serious) should be recorded on the CRF from the time the patient has 
taken at least 1 dose of study  treatment (Arm A) or from Cy cle 1 Day  1 (Arm B) through and 
including 90 calendar day s after the last administration of study  treatment (Arm A) or 
90days after the EOT visit (Arm B). 
If a patient begins a new anticancer therap y, the AE reporting period for non -serious AEs 
ends at the time the new treatment i s started.  Death must be reported if it occurs during the 
SAE reporting period after the last dose of stud y treatment, irrespective of any  intervening 
treatment.
8.3.Definition of an Adverse Event
An AE is an y untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investi gation patient administered a 
product or medical device; the event need not necessarily  have a causal relationship with the 
treatment or usage.  Examples of AEs include but are not limited to:

Page 106Abnormal test findings;
Clinically  significant symptoms and si gns;
Changes in ph ysical examination findings;
Hypersensitivity ;
Drug abuse;
Drug dependency .
Additionally , they  may  include the signs or s ymptoms resulting from:
Drug overdose;
Drug withdrawal;
Drug misuse; 
Drug interactions;
Extravasation;
Exposure during pregnancy  (EDP);
Exposure via breastfeeding;
Medication error;
Occupational exposure;
Worsening of signs and symptoms of the malignancy  under study  should be reported 
as AEs in the appropriate section of the CRF.  Disease progression assessed by  
measurement of malignant lesions on radiographs or other methods should not be 
reported as AEs.
8.3.1. Avelumab Adverse Events of Special Interest
Any AE that is suspected to be a potential irAE is considered an AE of special interest 
(AESI ). Specific guidance for the management of irAEs is provided in Section 5.4.3.4 .  
AESI s are reported according to the general AE r eporting rules specified in Section 8.1and 
Section 8.2.
8.4.Medication Errors
Medication errors may  result, in this study , from the administration or consumption of the 
wrong product, b y the wrong patient, at the wrong time, or at the wrong dosage strength.  
MSB0010718C
B9991001
Final Protocol Amendment 6, 0 8March 2021
PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL
Page 107Such medication errors occurring to a study participant are to be captured on the medication 
error CRF, which is a specific version of the AE page, and on the SAE form when 
appropriate.  In the event of medication dosing error, the sponsor should be notified 
immediately .
Medication errors are reportable irrespective of the presence of an associated AE/SAE, 
including:
Medication errors involving patient exposure to the study  treatment;
Potential medication errors or uses outside of what is foreseen in the protoco l that do 
or do not involve the participating patient.
Whether or not the medication error is accompanied by  an AE, as determined by  the 
investigator, the medication error is captured on the medication error version of the AE page 
and, if applicable, an y associated AEs are captured on an AE CRF page. 
The guidance on reporting of medication errors also applies to the reporting of overdose.
For purposes of this study, an overdose of avelumab is defined as an increase 5% than the 
planned avelumab dose for that particular administration.  
There is no specific treatment for avelumab overdose.  In the event of overdose with 
avelumab, the patient should be observed closely  for signs of toxicity .  Appropriate 
supportive treatment should be provided as clinically  indicated.
8.5.Abnormal Test Findings
The criteria for determining whether an abnormal test finding should be reported as an AE 
are as follows: 
Test result is associated with accompan ying symptoms; and/or
Test result requires additional diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention; 
and/or
Test result leads to a change in stud y dosing outside of protocol -stipulated dose 
adjustments or discontinuation from the study , significant additional concomitant 
drug treatment, or other therap y; and/or
Test result is considered to be an AE b y the investigator or sponsor.
Merel y repeating an abnormal test, in the absence of an y of the above conditions, does not 
constitute an AE.  An y abnormal test result that is determined to be an error does not require 
reporting as an AE.

Page 1088.6.Serious Adverse Events
A serious adverse event is any  untoward medical occurrence at any  dose that:
Results in death;
Is life -threatening (immediate risk of death);
Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitali zation;
Results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity  (substantial disruption of the 
ability  to conduct normal life functions);
Results in congenital anomaly /birth defect;
Progression of the malignancy  under stud y (including signs and s ymptoms of 
progression) should not be reported as an SAE unless the outcome is fatal within the 
safet y reporting period.  Hospitalization due to signs and s ymptoms of disease 
progression should not be reported as an SAE.  If the malignancy  has a fatal outcome 
during the stud y or within the safet y reporting period, then the event leading to death 
must be recorded as an AE and as an SAE with CTCAE (version 4.03) Grade 5 (see 
Section 8.8 Severity  Assessment).
Medical and scientific judgment is exercised in determining whether an event is an important 
medical event.  An important medical event may  not be immediately  life-threatening and/or 
resul t in death or hospitalization.  However, if it is determined that the event may  jeopardize 
the patient or may  require intervention, to prevent one of the other AE outcomes, the 
important medical event should be reported as serious.
Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for 
allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization; 
or development of drug dependency  or drug abuse.
8.6.1. Protocol -Specified Serious Adverse Events 
There are no protocol -specified SAEs in this study .  All SAEs will be reported by  the 
investigator as described in previous sections, and will be handled as SAEs in the safet y 
database (see Section 8.14.1 , Serious Adverse Event Reporting Requirements). 
8.6.2. Potential Cases of Drug- Induced Liver Injury 
Abnormal values in aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and/or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 
concurr ent with abnormal elevations in total bilirubin that meet the criteria outlined below in 
the absence of other causes of liver injury  are considered potential cases of drug- induced 
liver injury  (potential Hy’s law cases) and should alway s be considered impo rtant medical 
events. 
The threshold of laboratory  abnormalities for a potential case of drug -induced liver injury  
depends on the patient’s individual baseline values and underl ying conditions.  Patients who 
MSB0010718C
B9991001
Final Protocol Amendment 6, 0 8March 2021
PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL
Page 109present with the following laboratory  abnormalit ies should be evaluated further to 
definitively  determine the etiology  of the abnormal laboratory values:
Patients with AST or ALT and total bilirubin baseline values within the normal range 
who subsequently  present with AST or AL T values 3times the upper limit of 
normal (× ULN) concurrent with a total bilirubin value 2× ULN with no evidence 
of hemoly sis and an alkaline phosphatase value  2× ULN or not available.
For patients with preexisting ALT OR AST ORtotal bilirubin values above the ULN, 
the following threshold values should be used in the definition mentioned above:
For patients with preexisting AST or ALT baseline values above the normal 
range, AST or ALT value 2times the baseline values and 3 ×ULN, or 
8 ×ULN (whichever is smaller).
Concurrent with
Forpatients with preexisting values of total bilirubin above the normal range: 
Total bilirubin increased from baseline b y an amount of at least 1 × ULN orif the 
value reaches  3× ULN (whichever is smaller).
The patient should return to the investigational site and be evaluated as soon as possible, 
preferabl y within 48 hours from awareness of the abnormal results.  This evaluation should 
include laboratory  tests, detailed history  and phy sical assessment.  The possibility  of hepatic 
neoplasia (primary  or secondary ) should be considered.
In addition to repeating measurements of AST and AL T, laboratory  tests should include 
albumin, creatine kinase, total bilirubin, direct and indirect bilirubin, gamma -glutamy l 
transferase (GGT), PT/INR, and alka line phosphatase.  A detailed history , including relevant 
information, such as review of ethanol, acetaminophen , recreational drug, and supplement 
consumption, family  history , occupational exposure, sexual history , travel history , history  of 
contact with a jaundiced person, surgery , blood transfusion, history  of liver or allergic 
disease, and work exposure, should be collected.  Further testing for acute hepatitis A, B, or 
C infection and liver imaging (eg, biliary  tract) may  be warranted.  All cases confir med on 
repeat testing as meeting the laboratory  criteria defined above, with no other cause for Liver 
Function Test (LFT) abnormalities identified at the time should be considered potential Hy ’s 
law cases irrespective of availability  of all the results of the investigations performed to 
determine etiology  of the abnormal LFTs.  Such potential Hy ’s law cases should be reported 
as SAEs.
8.7.Hospitalization
Hospitalization is defined as an y initial admission (even less than 24 hours) in a hospital or 
equivalent he althcare facility  or any  prolongation of an existing admission.  Admission also 
includes transfer within the hospital to an acute/intensive care unit (eg, from the psy chiatric 
wing to a medical floor, medical floor to a coronary  care unit, or neurological floor to a 
tuberculosis unit).  An emergency  room visit does not necessarily constitute a hospitalization; 
MSB0010718C
B9991001
Final Protocol Amendment 6, 0 8March 2021
PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL
Page 110however, the event leading to the emergency  room visit should be assessed for medical 
importance.
Hospitalization does not include the following:
Rehabilitation facilities;
Hospice facilities;
Respite care (eg, caregiver relief);
Skilled nursing facilities;
Nursing homes;
Same day  surgeries (as outpatient/same day /ambulatory  procedures).
Hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization in the absence of a precipitating, clinical 
AE is not in itself an SAE.  Examples include: 
Admission for treatment of a preexisting condition not associated with the 
development of a new AE or with a worsening of the preexisting condition (eg, for 
workup of persistent pre-treatment laboratory  abnormality );
Social admission (eg, patient has no place to sleep);
Administrative admission (eg, for yearly physical examination);
Protocol -specified admission during a stud y (eg, for a procedure required by the stud y 
protocol);
Optional admission not associated with a precipitating clinical AE (eg, for elective 
cosmetic surgery );
Hospitalization for observation without a medical AE;
Preplanned treatments or surgical procedures.  These should be noted in the baseline 
documentation for the entire protocol and/or for the individual patient;
Admission exclusively  for the administration of blood products.
Diagnostic and therapeutic non -invasive and invasive procedures, such as surgery , should not 
be reported as AEs.  However, the medica l condition for which the procedure was performed 
should be reported if it meets the definition of an AE.  For example, an acute appendicitis 
that begins during the AE reporting period should be reported as the AE, and the resulting 
appendectomy  should be recorded as treatment of the AE.

Page 1118.8.Severity Assessment
Grade Clinical Description of Severity
0 No Change from normal or reference range (This grade is not included in the 
Version 4.03 CTCAE document but may  be used in certain circumstances.)
1 MILD Adverse Event
2 MODERATE Adverse Event
3 SEVERE Adverse Event
4 LIFE -THREATENING consequences; urgent intervention indicated
5 DEATH RELATED TO Adverse Event
Note the distinction between the severit y and the seriousness of an AE.  A severe event is not 
necessarily  an SAE.  For example, a headache may  be severe (interferes significantly  with 
patient's usual function) but would not be classified as serious unless it met one of the criteria 
for SAEs listed above.
8.9.Causality Assessment
The investigator’s assessment of causalit y must be provided for all AEs (serious and 
non-serious); the investigator must record the causal relationship in the CRF, as appropriate, 
and report such an assessment in accordance with the serious adverse event reporting 
requirements if applicable.  An investigator’s causality  assessment is the determination of 
whether there exists a reasonable possibility  that the study  treatment caused or co ntributed to 
an AE; generall y the facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal relationship should be 
provided.  If the investigator does not know whether or not the stud y treatment caused the 
event, then the event will be handled as “related to study treatment” for reporting purposes, 
as defined b y the sponsor (see Section 8.14, Reporting Requirements).  If the investigator's 
causality  assessment is “unknown but not related to study  treatment”, this should be clearl y 
documented on study  records. 
In addition, if the investigator determines that an SAE is associated with study  procedures, 
the investigator must record this causal relationship in the source documents and CRF, as 
appropriate, and report such an assessment in accordance with the SAE reporting 
requirements, if applicable.
8.10. Exposure During Pregnancy
For both unapproved/unlicensed products and for marketed products, an ex posure during 
pregnancy  (EDP) occurs if:
1. A female becomes, or is found to be, pregnant either while receiving or having been 
exposed (eg, because of treatment or environmental exposure) to the study  treatment; 
or the female becomes or is found to be pregna nt after discontinuing and/or being 
exposed to the study  treatment;
MSB0010718C
B9991001
Final Protocol Amendment 6, 0 8March 2021
PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL
Page 112An example of environmental exposure would be a case involving direct contact with 
a Pfizer product in a pregnant woman (eg, a nurse reports that she is pregnant and has 
been exposed to ch emotherapeutic products).
2.A male has been exposed (eg, because of treatment or environmental exposure) to the 
study  treatment prior to or around the time of conception and/or is exposed during his 
partner’s pregnancy .
If a study patient or study patient’s partner becomes or is found to be pregnant during the 
study  patient’s treatment with the study  treatment, the investigator must submit this 
information to the Pfizer drug safet y unit on an SAE report form and EDP supplemental 
form, regardless of whether an SAE has occurred.   In addition, the investigator must submit 
information regarding environmental exposure to a Pfizer product in a pregnant woman (eg, a 
patient reports that she is pregnant and has been exposed to a cy totoxic product by  inhalation 
or spil lage) using the EDP supplemental form.  This must be done irrespective of whether an 
AE has occurred and within 24 hours of awareness of the exposure.  The information 
submitted should include the anticipated date of delivery  (see below for information rel ated 
to termination of pregnancy ).
Follow -up is conducted to obtain general information on the pregnancy  and its outcome for 
all EDP reports with an unknown outcome.  The investigator will follow the pregnancy  until 
completion (or until pregnancy  termination) and notify  Pfizer of the outcome as a follow-up 
to the initial EDP supplemental form.  In the case of a live birth, the structur al integrity  of the 
neonate can be assessed at the time of birth.  In the event of a termination, the reason(s) for 
termination should be specified and, if clinicall y possible, the structural integrit y of the 
terminated fetus should be assessed b y gross visual inspection (unless preprocedure test 
findings are conclusive for a congenital anomal y and the findings are reported).
If the outcome of the pregnancy  meets the criteria for an SAE (ie, ectopic pregnancy , 
spontaneous abortion, intrauterine fetal demise , neonatal death, or congenital anomal y [in a 
live-born bab y, a terminated fetus, an intrauterine fetal demise, or a neonatal death]), the 
investigator should follow the procedures for reporting SAEs.
Additional information about pregnancy  outcomes that ar e reported as SAEs follows: 
Spontaneous abortion includes miscarriage and missed abortion.
Neonatal deaths that occur within 1 month of birth should be reported, without regard 
to causality , as SAEs .  In addition, infant deaths after 1 month should be reported as 
SAEs when the investigator assesses the infant death as related or possibly  related to 
exposure to the study  treatment. 
Additional information regarding the EDP may  be requested by  the inve stigator.  Further 
follow -up of birth outcomes will be handled on a case- by-case basis (eg, follow -up on 
preterm infants to identify developmental delay s).  In the case of paternal exposure, the 
investigator will provide the study  patient with the Pregnant Partner Release of Information 
Form to deliver to his partner.  The investigator must document in the source documents that 
MSB0010718C
B9991001
Final Protocol Amendment 6, 0 8March 2021
PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL
Page 113the patient was given the Pregnant Partner Release of Information Form to provide to his 
partner.
8.11. Occupational Exposure
An occupati onal exposure occurs when, during the performance of job duties, a person 
(whether a healthcare professional or otherwise) gets in unplanned direct contact with the 
product, which may  or may  not lead to the occurrence of an AE.
An occupational exposure is reported to the drug safet y unit within 24 hours of the 
investigator’s awareness, using the SAE report form, regardless of whether there is an 
associated AE/SAE.  Since the information does not pertain to a patient enrolled in the study, 
the information is not reported on a CRF; however, a cop y of the completed SAE report form 
is maintained in the investigator site file.
8.12. Withdrawal Due to Adverse Events (also see Section 6.5 Patient Withdrawal)
Withdrawal due to AEs should be distinguished from withdrawal due to other causes, 
according to the definition of AE noted earlier, and recorded on the appropriate AE CRF 
page. 
When a patient withdraws because of an SAE, the SAE must be reported in accordance with 
the reporting requirements defined below.
8.13. Eliciting Adverse Event Information
The investigator is to report all directly  observed AEs and all AEs spontaneously  reported b y 
the study  patie nt or legally  acceptable representative.  In addition, each study  patient or 
legally  acceptable representative will be questioned about AEs.
8.14. Reporting Requirements
Each AE is to be assessed to determine if it meets the criteria for SAEs.  If an SAE occurs,
expedited reporting will follow local and international regulations, as appropriate.
8.14.1. Serious Adverse Event Reporting Requirements
If an SAE occurs, Pfizer is to be notified within 24 hours of investigator awareness of the 
event.  In particular, if the SAE is fatal or life -threatening, notification to Pfizer must be 
made immediately , irrespective of the extent of available AE information.  This timeframe 
also applies to additional new information (follow -up) on previousl y forwarded SAE reports 
as well as to the initial and follow -up reporting of EDP, exposure via breastfeeding, and 
occupational exposure cases. 
In the rare event that the investigator does not become aware of the occurrence of an SAE 
immediately  (eg, if an outpatient study  patient initially  seeks treatment elsewhere), the 
investigator is to report the event within 24 hours after learning of it and document the time 
of his or her first awareness of the AE.
MSB0010718C
B9991001
Final Protocol Amendment 6, 0 8March 2021
PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL
Page 114For all SAEs, the investigator is obligated to pursue and provide information to Pfizer i n 
accordance with the timeframes for reporting specified above.  In addition, an investigator 
may be requested by  Pfizer to obtain specific additional follow -up information in an 
expedited fashion.  This information collected for SAEs is more detailed than that captured 
on the AE CRF.  In general, this will include a description of the AE in sufficient detail to 
allow for a complete medical assessment of the case and independent determination of 
possible causality .  Information on other possible causes of the event, such as concomitant 
medications, vaccines, and/or illnesses must be provided.  I n the case of a patient death, a 
summary of available autopsy  escalations must be submitted as soon as possible to Pfizer or 
its designated representative. 
8.14.2. Non-Serious Adverse Event Reporting Requirements
All AEs will be reported on the AE page(s) of the CRF.  I t should be noted that the form for 
collection of SAE information is not the same as the AE CRF.  Where the same data are 
collected, the forms must be completed in a consistent manner.  For example, the same AE 
term should be used on both forms.  AEs should be reported using concise medical 
terminology  on the CRFs as well as on the form for collection of SAE information.
For Investigative Sites in Japan Only: 
After avelumab is approved for treatment of advanced urothelial ca rcinoma by the Ministry  
of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHL W) in Japan, investigators in Japan may  be requested 
by Pfizer to obtain specific additional follow -up information to be provided to 
Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency  (PMDA) and/or MHLW if a reported 
treatment -related non-serious AE is found to be unexpected according to the Japanese 
Prescribing Information. If this occurs, the investigator will be required to pursue and 
provide the additional information to Pfizer; this information may  be more detailed than the 
information captured on the adverse event case report form. In general, the information will 
include sufficient detail regarding the description of the adverse event to allow for a complete 
medical assessment of the case and independent determination of possible causality . 
Information regarding other possible causes of the adverse event, such as concomitant 
medications and illnesses, must also be provided.
8.14.3. Sponsor’s Repor ting Requirements to Regulatory Authorities
Adverse event reporting, including suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions, will be 
carried out in accordance with applicable local regulations.
9. DATA ANALYSIS/STATIS TICAL METHODS
Detailed methodology  for summary  and statistical anal yses of the data collected in this study  
will be documented in a statistical analy sis plan (SAP), which will be maintained by  Pfizer.  
This document may  modify  the plans outlined in the protocol; however , any  major 
modifications of the primary  endpoint and/or its analy sis will also be reflected in a protocol 
amendment.

Page 1159.1.Sample Size Determination
The primary  objective of this study  is to demonstrate the benefit of maintenance treatment 
with avelumab plus BSC vs. BSC alone in prolonging OS in patients with unresectable 
locally  advanced or metastatic UC whose disease did not progress on or following 
completion of first -line platinum- containing chemotherap y in each co -primary  UC patient 
populations: 1) patients determined to have PD -L1-positive tumors (including infiltrating 
immune cells) by  a verified GMP PD -L1 IHC test, and 2) all randomized patients. 
The study  will randomize a total of approximately  668 patients, with at least 334 patients 
with confi rmed PD -L1-positive tumors, using 1:1 randomization, stratified by  best response 
to chemotherap y (CR/PR vs. SD) and site of metastasis (visceral vs. non -visceral) at time of 
initiating first -line chemotherap y.  The “non -visceral” stratum includes patients with 
locally -advanced disease as well as patients with only  non- visceral disease.  The ty pe1 error 
rate will be split between the co -primary  populations to preserve the overall ty pe1 error rate 
for the stud y at 0.025 one -sided.  I t is estimated that at least 50% of the randomized patients 
will have adequate tissue for anal ysis and be determined to have PD -L1-positive tumors.  
The sample size for this study  is determined based on the following assumptions: 
For all patients and patients with PD -L1-positiv e tumors receiving BSC alone after 
first-line chemotherap y, the median OS is 12 months.33
For all patients receiving avelumab plus BSC after first- line chemotherap y, the 
median OS is assumed to be 17.1 months.
For patients with PD -L1-positive tumors receiving avelumab plus BSC after first- line 
chemotherap y, the median OS is assumed to be 18.5 months.
This corresponds to a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.7 for all patients and 0.65 for patients with 
PD-L1-positive tumors under the exponential model assumption. 
For all patients, if the true HR is 0.7 under the alternative h ypothesis, a total of 425 OS 
events will be required to have 93% power to detect a HR of 0.7 using a one -sided log rank 
test at a significance level of 0.015 and a 2 -look group -sequential design with L an-DeMets 
(O’Brien -Fleming)71-spending function t o determine the efficacy  boundary  and a Gamma 
Family  (-8) -spending function to determine the non- binding futility  boundary . 
For patients with PD -L1 positive tumors, if the true HR is 0.65 under the alternative 
hypothesis, then a total of 219 OS events will be required to have 80% power to detect a HR 
of 0.65 using a one -sided log rank test at a significance level of 0.01 and a 2 -look group 
sequential design with Lan -DeMets (O’Brien -Fleming) -spending function to determine the 
efficacy  boundary  and a Gam ma Family  (-8) -spending function to determine the non -
binding futility  boundary (see Section 9.6 Interim Analy sis for details).
The sample size further assumes a 5% drop -out rate for OS on either treatment arm, a 
non-uniform patient accrual accomplished over a 28- month period, and follow -up for about

will occur after the target number of events has been reached in both co -prim ary populations 
and the last patient randomized in the study  has been followed for at least 12 months after 
randomization.
The study  will be considered positive if the stratified log rank test for OS is significant at the 
respective adjusted levels at the interim or at the final anal yses, for either of the two 
co-primary  populations. 
9.2.Analysis Populations
9.2.1. Full Analysis Set
The Full Anal ysis Set will include patients who are randomized.  Patients will be classified 
according to the treatment and stratum assigned at randomization.  The Full Analy sis Set will 
be the primary  anal ysis set for evaluating all efficacy  endpoints and patient characteristics 
within each of the co -primary  populations: 1) patients determined to have PD -L1-positive 
tumors (including infi ltrating immune cells) b y a verified GMP PD -L1 IHC test and 2) all 
randomized patients.
Patients to be included in the co -primary  population defined by  PD-L1 positive tumors will 
be determined b y retrospective analy sis of the mandatory  recent FFPE tumor bi ospecimen 
(see Sections 4.1 and 6.1.1 ) using an anal ytically-validated and GMP- verified PD -L1 IHC 
assay  with a pre -specified scoring algorithm defining PD -L1 positive status.  The PD -L1 IHC 
assay  and scoring algorithm will be fully  defined prior to initiation of sample anal ysis.
9.2.2. Per-Protocol Analysis Set
The Per -Protocol Analy sis Set is a subset of the Full Ana lysis Set and will include patients 
who receive at least 1 dose of study  treatment or who only  receive BSC and do not have 
major protocol deviations expected to impact the primary  objectives of the study .  Major 
protocol deviations will be pre -specified in the SAP.  The Per -Protocol Analy sis Set will be 
used for sensitivity  anal yses for the primary  efficacy  endpoint.
9.2.3. Safety Analysis Set
The Safet y Analysis Set will include all patients who receive at least 1 dose of avelumab or 
who only  receive BSC.  Patien ts will be classified according to the treatment assigned at 
randomization unless the incorrect treatment(s) are received throughout the dosing period in 
which case patients will be classified according to the first treatment received.  The Safety  
Analy sisSet will be the primary  population for evaluating treatment 
administration/compliance and safet y.
9.2.4. PK Analysis Set
The PK Concentration Analy sis Set will include all treated patients who have at least 
1concentration above the below limit of quantitation ( BLQ) of avelumab.
The PK Parameter Anal ysis Set will include all treated patients who have at least 1 of the PK 
parameters of interest.

The Immunogenicit y Analysis Set will include all treated Arm A patients who have at least 
1ADA sample collected.
9.2.6. Biomarker Analysis Set
The Biomarker Anal ysis Set will include all treated Arm A patients who have at least 
1baseline biomarker assessment performed.
9.3.Efficacy Analysis
All efficacy  analy ses will be performed on the Full Analy sis Se t within each of the 
co-primary  populations unless otherwise specified. 
All analy ses will be performed by  using SASVersion 9.1.3 or higher. 
All secondary  endpoints based on radiological assessments of tumor burden (ie, PFS, OR, 
TTR, DR, DC) will be der ived using the local radiologist’s/investigator’s assessment.  
Radiographic images and clinical information collected on stud y will also be reviewed b y 
BICR to verify  investigator reported tumor assessments and be used for primary  anal yses.
The primary  analysis will be repeated on the Per -Protocol Analy sis Set as a sensitivity  
analysis.  Further sensitivity  anal yses will be described in the SAP. 
9.3.1. Analysis of Primary Endpoint
OS is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of death du e to an y 
cause.  Patients last known to be alive will be censored at date of last contact.   
The primary  anal yses of OS will be performed based on the Full Anal ysis Set.  A stratified 
log-rank test (one -sided) stratified by  stratification factors described in Section 3 will be used 
within each comparison at the interim and/or final anal yses with the overall significance level 
preserved at its respective levels (one -sided 0.015 for all patients and one- sided 0.01 for 
patient s with PD -L1-positive tumors).  OS time associated with each treatment arm will be 
summarized using the Kaplan -Meier method and display ed graphically  where appropriate.  
Confidence intervals (CIs) for the 25th, 50thand 75thpercentiles will be reported.  The Cox 
proportional hazards model will be fitted to compute the treatment hazard ratios and the 
corresponding 95% CI.  
OS will also be evaluated based on the PPS as a sensitivity  analy sis using the stratified 
log-rank test with the overall significance l evel preserved at its respective levels (one -sided 
0.015 for all patients and one- sided 0.01 for patients with PD -L1-positive tumors).
9.3.2. Analysis of Secondary Endpoints
All analy ses will be performed using the Full Analy sis Set separatel y for each co -primary
population.  The anal ysis of PFS using the Full Analy sis Set described in Section 9.2.1 based 
on BICR assessment will be repeate d based on the investigator’s assessment.

Page 118The anal yses of other tumor -related endpoints will be based on the investigator’s assessment, 
as well as on the BICR. 
Progression -Free Survival
PFS is defined as the time from randomization to the date of the firs t documentation of 
objective progression of disease (PD) or death due to an y cause, whichever occurs first.  
PFS data will be censored on the date of the last adequate tumor assessment for patients who 
do not have an event (PD or death), for patients who start new anti -cancer treatment prior to 
an event, or for patients with an event after two or more missing tumor assessments.  Patients 
who do not have a baseline tumor assessment or who do not have an y post -baseline tumor 
assessments will be censored on the day  of randomization, with a duration of 1 day, unless 
death occurred on or before the time of the second planned tumor assessment in which case 
the death will be considered an event.
Within each co -primary  population PFS time will be summarized by  treatment arm using the 
Kaplan -Meier method and display ed graphically  where appropriate.  Confidence intervals 
(CIs) for the 25th, 50th, and 75thpercentiles of the event -free time will be reported.  The Cox 
proportional hazards model will be fitted to compute the treatment hazard ratios and the 
corresponding 95% CI.
Objective Response (OR)
Objective response is defined as a CR or PR according to RECI ST v1.1 ( Appendix 2) 
recorded from randomization until disease progression or death due to an y cause.  Both CR 
and PR must be confirmed by  repeat assessments performed no less than 4 weeks after the 
criteria for response are first met.  A patient will be considered to have achieved an OR if the 
patient has a sustained CR or PR according to RECI ST v1.1 definitions.  Otherwise, the 
patient will be considered as a non -responder in the ORR anal ysis.  Additionally , patients 
with inadequate data for tumor assessment (eg, no baseline assessment or no follow -up 
assessments) will be considered as non -responders in the ORR analy sis. 
The ORR in each randomized treatment arm will be estimated b y dividing the number of 
patients with confirmed objective response (CR or PR) by the number of patients randomized 
to the respective treatment arm.  The corresponding exact 2 -sided 95% CIs will be provided 
by treatment arm. 
In addition, the best overall response for each patient will be summarized by treatment arm.
Time to Tumor Response (TTR)
Time to tumor response (TTR) is defined for patients with an objective response per RECI ST 
v1.1 ( Appendix 2) as the time from randomization to first documentation of objective tumor 
response (CR or PR). 
MSB0010718C

Final Protocol Amendment 6, 0 8March 2021
PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL
Page 119TTR will be summarized by  treatment arm using descriptive statistics (n, mean, median, 
standard deviation, minimum, and maximum).
Duration of Response (DR)
Duration of response (DR) is defined, for patients with an objective response per RECI ST 
v1.1, as the time from the first documentation of objective tumor response (CR or PR) to the 
first documen tation of objective tumor progression or death due to an y cause, whichever 
occurs first.  Censoring rules for DR will follow those described above for PFS. 
DR will be summarized by  treatment arm using Kaplan -Meier method and display ed 
graphicall y, where a ppropriate.  The median DR and 95% CI  for the median will be provided 
for each treatment arm.
Disease Control (DC)
Disease control (DC) is defined as complete response (CR), partial response (PR), non -
CR/non -PD, or stable disease (SD) according to the RECI ST v.1.1 ( Appendix 2) recorded 
from randomization until disease progression or death due to an y cause.  Both CR and PR 
must be confirmed b y repeat assessments perfo rmed no less than 4 weeks after the criteria for 
response are first met.  Criterion for SD must have been met at least 6 weeks after the date of 
randomization. 
The DC rate (DCR) on each randomized treatment arm will be estimated by dividing the 
number of patients with CR, PR, non -CR/non- PR, or SD overall b y the number of patients 
randomized to the treatment arm. The corresponding exact 2 -sided 95% CIs for DCR will be 
provided b y treatment arm. 
Patient Reported Outcomes (PRO) Endpoints
The FBlSI -DRS -P subscale will be used to determine the Time to Deterioration (TTD).  TTD 
is defined as the time from first dose (baseline) to the first time the patient’s score shows a 
3point or higher decrease in the FBlSI -DRS -P subscale.  Patients will be censored at the l ast 
time when they  completed a sub- scale assessment if they  have not deteriorated. 
Kaplan -Meier plots will be used to display  deterioration over time and a log -rank test will be 
used to compare the TTD between the two treatment arms.  The median time and 2 -sided 
95% CI  for the median will be provided based on the Brookmey er Crowley  method .72  
Yost & Eton (2005)73established that a 3 -point or a greater minimally  important difference 
(MID) from baseline on the FACT scales would correlate with change in dise ase s ymptoms 
and status.  Thus, in the analy sis of TTD, a MID of 3 points or greater is proposed within the 
FBlSI -DRS -P sub-scale of the NCCN- FACT FBlSI -18.  Additionall y, symptom sub- scale 
improvement will be defined as an increase of at least 3 points in the mean FBlSI -DRS -P 
sub-scale score of the NCCN -FACT FBlSI -18.  Within group and between group 
comparisons to baseline in order to assess s ymptom improvement among treatment arms will 
also be performed.  To test the robustness of the MI D of 3 points, sen sitivity  anal yses using 
2and 4 points will be explored.

range and 95% CI ] of absolute scores will be reported for all of the subscales of the 
NCCN -FACT FBlSI -18 questionnaire and the EQ -5D- 5L VAS scale.  The mean change of 
absolute scores from baseline (and 95% CI) will also be assessed.  Line charts depicting the 
means and mean changes of items and subscales over time will be provided for each 
treatment arm.  Additional exploratory  anal yses may  be performed, such as repeated 
measures mixed effects modeling and anal yses of patients who experienced a complete 
response.
Pharmac okinetic Analysis of Avelumab 
CmaxandCtrough for avelumab will be summarized descriptivel y (n, mean, SD, CV, median, 
minimum, maximum, geometric mean, its associated CV, and 95% confidence interval) by  
cycle, and day .  The trough concentrations for avel umab will be plotted using a box -whisker 
plot by  cycle and day  in order to assess the attainment of steady -state.
Immunogenicity Assessment
For the immunogenicit y data, the percentage of patients receiving avelumab with positive 
ADA and neutralizing antibo dies each will be summarized.  For patients with positive ADA, 
the magnitude (titer), time of onset, and duration of ADA response will also be described, if 
data permit. 
Because the observed incidence of ADA is highl y dependent on multiple factors includi ng 
the assay s used for ADA detection, timing of sample collection, and immune status of the 
patients, the incidence of ADA observed in the planned stud y ma y differ from the incidence 
reported in historical clinical trials. 
Analysis of Biomarker Endpoints 
Analy ses to evaluate candidate predictive biomarkers of sensitivity  or resistance to avelumab 
in addition to PD -L1 expression defining the co -primary  population may  also be performed 
in which biomarker status (ie, positive or negative) will be determined in all randomized 
patients by  a predictive biomarker test with an established scoring algorithm defining 
positive and negative that is developed by  the sponsor.  Anal ysis of primary  and secondary  
efficacy  endpoints in subgroups defined by  biomarker status will be performed and reported 
as described above.  Comparisons will be made between biomarker subgroups (positive and 
negative) within treatment arms and between treatment arms within biomarker subgroups.
Exposure/Response Analysis
In addition, the relationship between exposure and efficacy  and safet y endpoints may  be 
explored, as necessary , based on emerging efficacy  and safet y data.  Refer to the SAP for 
details.  The results of these modeling anal yses may  be reported separately from the clinical 
study  report.

Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize all patient characteristics, treatment 
administration/compliance, safet y parameters, and biomarkers.  Data will also be displayed 
graphicall y, where appropriate.
9.4.1. Statistical Analysis of Biomarker Endpoints
It is possible that, during the course of this stud y, emerging data and/or methods will suggest 
additional patient selection strategies bey ond the verified GMP PD -L1 test used to define the 
co-primary  populations.  Retrospective analy sis of biomarkers such as PD -L1 (using a 
different method from the GMP test) and CD8 are planned as a secondary  objective to enable 
refinements in patient selection strategy , whether via technical modifications or revised 
thresholds.  These methods may  be single -or multi -analyte based on IHC or 
immunofluorescence.  Further exploratory  analy ses may  also be performed to assess the 
predictive and/or pharmacody namic utility  of additional methods, such as profiling of gene 
expression signatures indi cative of immune activation.  The Biomarker Analy sis Set will be 
used for the anal ysis of biomarker endpoints.  
Biomarkers will be assessed separatel y for whole blood, serum, plasma, archival tumor 
tissue, and de novo tumor biopsies.  I n each case, summar ies of baseline levels, changes from 
baseline (where appropriate), gene alteration or biomarker signature status, will be reported.  
For continuous variables summary  statistics may  include the mean, ratio to baseline, standard 
deviation, median, 25thand 75thquartile, %CV and minimum/maximum levels of biomarker 
measures; for categorical variables, the summary  may  include number, percentage, and odds 
ratio, as appropriate.
Data from biomarker assay s will be anal yzed using graphical methods and descriptive 
statistics such as linear regression, t- test, and anal ysis of variance (ANOVA).  The statistical 
approach may  examine correlations of biomarker results with pharmacokinetic parameters 
and measures of anti- tumor efficacy .
Regarding exploratory  biomarkers, the data analy sis will be conducted with the goal of 
identify ing predictive and/or pharmacod ynamic (ie, baseline and change from baseline 
values) biomarkers associated with clinical outcome, encompassing both safet y and efficacy.  
Candidate biomarkers will be validated in subsequent trials.

Page 122Adverse Events
Adverse events will be classified using the medical dictionary  for regulatory  activities 
(MedDRA) classification sy stem.  The severit y of t he toxicities will be graded according to 
the NCI  CTCAE v4.03 whenever possible (http://ctep.info.nih.gov/reporting/ctc.html).  The 
frequency  of patients experiencing treatment emergent adverse events corresponding to body  
systems and MedDRA preferred term will be reported.  Adverse events will be graded b y 
worst NCI  CTCAE v4.03 Grade.  Adverse events will be summarized by  cycle and by  
relatedness to stud y treatment. 
Emphasis in the analy sis will be placed on AEs classified as treatment emergent.  Adverse 
events leading to death or discontinuation of study treatment, events classified as NCI 
CTCAE v4.0 Grade 3 or higher, trial drug-related events, and serious adverse events will be 
considered with special attention.  As appropriate, the difference in risk b etween treatment 
arms for AEs of clinical interest may  be further assessed as described in the SAP.
Detailed information collected for each AE will include a description of the event, duration, 
whether the AE was serious, intensity , relationship to study  treatment, action taken, and 
clinical outcome.
Laboratory Abnormalities
The laboratory  abnormalities will be graded according to the NCI CTCAE v4.03 severit y 
grade.  The frequency  of patients with laboratory  test abnormalities will be summarized 
according t o the worst grade for each laboratory  test. 
For laboratory  tests without an NCI  CTCAE grade definition, results will be categorized as 
normal (within normal ranges), abnormal, or not done.
Shift tables will be provided to examine the distribution of labor atory  abnormalities. 
9.6. Interim Analysis
The interim anal ysis will be performed based on the Full Anal ysis Set. 
The purposes of the interim analy sis are to: (i) allow earl y stopping of the study  for futility , 
(ii)to allow earl y stopping of the stud y for ef ficacy , (iii) to assess safet y of avelumab, and 
(iv)to potentially  adjust the sample size.  The interim analy sis for both co- primary  
populations will be performed at the same time.
The interim anal ysis of OS will be performed after at least 315 of all ran domized patients 
have died (74% of the total OS events needed), and all of the following conditions have been 
met:
i. All initially  planned patients have been randomized; and 
ii. At least 146 patients with PD -L1-positive tumors have died (approximately 66.7% of 
the total OS events expected in the PD- L1-positive tumor population).

The efficacy  boundary  is crossed for both populations (all and PD -L1+); or
The futility  boundary  is crossed for one of the populations and the efficacy  boundary  
is crossed for the other population.
Alternativel y, as appropriate, the sample size of the study may be adjusted using the method 
outlined by  Cui et al [1999] .74  If the results of the interim anal ysis indicate serious safet y

9.7. External Data Monitoring Committee
This study  will use an E -DMC . 
The E- DMC will be responsible for ongoing monitoring of the safet y of patients in the study  
according to the charter.  The recommendations made by  the E -DMC to alter the conduct of 
the study  will be forwarded to Pfizer for final decision.  Pfizer will forward such decisions, 
which may  include summaries of aggregate analy ses of endpoint events and of safet y data 
that are not endpoints, to regulatory  authorities, as appropriate.  
The E-DMC will convene to monitor safet y in the study  approximately  every  6 months.  
Following the pre -planned interim analy sis at which the primary  objective was met, the E -
DMC had completed its study -specific activities and was therefore closed.
10.QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE
Pfizer or its agent will conduct periodic monitoring visits during stud y conduct to ensure that 
the protocol and Good Clinical Practices (GCPs ) are being followed.  The monitors may  
review source documents to confirm that the data recorded on CRFs is accurate.  The 
investigator and institution will allow Pfizer monitors/auditors or its agents and appropriate 
regulatory  authorities direct access to source documents to perform this verification.  This 
verification may  also occur after study  completion.

by the institutional review board (I RB)/ethics committee (EC), and/or to quality  assurance 
audits performed b y Pfizer, or companies working with or on behalf of Pfizer, and/or to 
inspection by appropriate regulatory  authorities.
The investigator(s) will notify  Pfizer or its agents immediately  of any  regulatory  inspection 
notification in relation to the study .  Furthermore, the investigator will cooperate with Pfizer 
or its agents to prepare the study  site for the inspection and will allow Pfizer or its agent, 
whenever feasible, to be present during the inspection.  The investigator will promptly  
provide copies of the inspection findings to Pfizer or its agent.  Before response submission 
to the regulatory  authorities, the investigator will provide Pfizer or its agents with an 
opportunity  to review and comment on responses to any  such findings.
It is important that the investigator(s) and their relevant personnel are available during the 
monitoring visits and possible audits or inspections and that sufficient time is devoted to the 
process.
11.DATA HANDLING AND RE CORD KEEPING
11.1. Case Report Forms/Electronic Data Record
As used in this protocol, the term CRF should be understood to refer to either a paper form or 
an electronic data record or both, depending on the data collection method used in this study .
A CRF is require d and should be completed for each included patient.  The completed 
original CRFs are the sole propert y of Pfizer and should not be made available in any form to 
third parties, except for authorized representatives of Pfizer or appropriate regulatory  
authorities, without written permission from Pfizer.
The investigator has ultimate responsibility  for the collection and reporting of all clinical, 
safet y and laboratory data entered on the CRFs and any other data collection forms (source 
documents) and ensurin g that they  are accurate, authentic/original, attributable, complete, 
consistent, legible, timely  (contemporaneous), enduring, and available when required.  The 
CRFs must be signed b y the investigator or b y an authorized staff member to attest that the 
data contained on the CRFs are true.  An y corrections to entries made in the CRFs or source 
documents must be dated, initialed and explained (if necessary ) and should not obscure the 
original entry . 
In most cases, the source documents are the hospital's or t he phy sician's patient chart.  In 
these cases data collected on the CRFs must match the data in those charts. 
In some cases, the CRF, or part of the CRF, may  also serve as source documents.  In these 
cases, a document should be available at the investigat ive site as well as at Pfizer and clearl y 
identify  those data that will be recorded in the CRF, and for which the CRF will stand as the 
source document.

Page 12511.2. Record Retention
To enable evaluations and/or audits from regulatory authorities or Pfizer, the investi gator 
agrees to keep records, including the identit y of all participating patients (sufficient 
information to link records, eg, CRFs and hospital records), all original signed informed 
consent documents, copies of all CRFs, safety  reporting forms, source d ocuments, and 
detailed records of treatment disposition, and adequate documentation of relevant 
correspondence (eg, letters, meeting minutes, telephone calls reports).  The records should be 
retained b y the investigator according to I CH guidelines, local r egulations, or as specified in 
the Clinical Study  Agreement (CSA), whichever is longer.
If the investigator becomes unable for an y reason to continue to retain study records for the 
required period (eg, retirement, relocation), Pfizer should be prospective ly notified.  The 
study  records must be transferred to a designee acceptable to Pfizer, such as another 
investigator, another institution, or to an independent third part y arranged by Pfizer.  
Investigator records must be kept for a minimum of 15 years aft er completion or 
discontinuation of the study or for longer if required by  applicable local regulations.
The investigator must obtain Pfizer's written permission before disposing of an y records, 
even if retention requirements have been met.
12.ETHICS
12.1. Instit utional Review Board/Ethics Committee 
It is the responsibility  of the investigator to have prospective approval of the study  protocol, 
protocol amendments, informed consent documents, and other relevant documents, 
eg,recruitment advertisements, if applic able, from the I RB/EC.  All correspondence with the 
IRB/EC should be retained in the investigator file.  Copies of I RB/EC approvals should be 
forwarded to Pfizer.
The only  circumstance in which an amendment may  be initiated prior to IRB/EC approval is 
wher e the change is necessary  to eliminate apparent immediate hazards to the patients.  In 
that event, the investigator must notify  the IRB/EC and Pfizer in writing immediately  after 
the implementation.
12.2. Ethical Conduct of the Study
The study  will be conducted in accordance with legal and regulatory  requirements, as well as 
the general principles set forth in the International Ethical Guidelines for Biomedical 
Research Involving Human Subjects (Council for International Organizations of Medical 
Sciences 2002), G uidelines for GCP (ICH 1996), and the Declaration of Helsinki (World

will maintain a confidential list of patients who participated in the study , linking each 
patient’s numerical code to his or her actual identity.  In case of data transfer, Pfizer will 
maintain high standard s of confidentialit y and protection of patients’ personal data consistent 
with applicable privacy  laws.
The informed consent documents must be in compliance with ICH GCP, local regulatory  
requirements, and legal requirements, including applicable privacy  laws.
The informed consent document(s) used during the informed consent process must be 
reviewed and approved by the sponsor, approved by  the IRB/EC before use, and available for 
inspection.
The investigator must ensure that each study  patient, or his or her legall y acceptable 
representative (as allowed by local guideline/practice), is fully  informed about the nature and 
objectives of the stud y and possible risks associated with participation. 
Whenever consent is obtained from patient’s legally  acceptabl e representative, the patient’s 
assent (affirmative agreement) must subsequently be obtained when the patient has the 
capacity  to provide assent, as determined by  the IRB/EC.  If the investigator determines that 
a patient’s decisional capacity  is so limite d he/she cannot reasonabl y be consulted, then, as 
permitted by  the IRB/EC and consistent with local regulatory  and legal requirements, the 
patient’s assent may  be waived with source documentation of the reason assent was not 
obtained.  If the stud y patient does not provide his or her own consent, the source documents 
must record wh y the patient did not provide consent (eg, minor, decisionally -impaired adult), 
how the investigator determined that the person signing the consent was the patient’s legall y 
accep table representative, the consent signer’s relationship to the study  patient (eg, parent, 
spouse), and that the patient’s assent was obtained, or waived.  If assent is obtained verball y 
it must be documented in the source documents.
The investigator, or a person designated by  the investigator, will obtain written informed 
consent from each patient or the patient's legally acceptable representative before an y

signed consent document.
12.4. Patient Recruitment
Advertisements approved by  IRBs/ECs and investigator databases may  be used as 
recruitment procedures.
Pfizer will have an opportunity to review and approve the content of any  study  recruitment 
materials directed to potential study  patients before such materials are used.
12.5. Reporting of Safety Issues and Serious Breaches of the Protocol or ICH GCP
In the event of an y prohibition or restriction imposed (ie, clinical hold) b y an applicable 
competent authorit y in any ar ea of the world, or if the investigator is aware of an y new 
information that might influence the evaluation of the benefits and risks of the study 
treatment, Pfizer should be informed immediatel y. 
In addition, the investigator will inform Pfizer immediate ly of any  urgent safet y measures 
taken b y the investigator to protect the study patients against an y immediate hazard, and of 
any serious breaches of this protocol or of ICH GCP that the investigator becomes aware of.
13.DEFINITION OF END OF TRIAL
13.1. End of Trial in a Member State
End of trial in a Member State of the European Union (EU) is defined as the time at which it 
is deemed that a sufficient number of patients have been recruited and completed the study  as 
stated in the regulatory  application (ie, clinica l trial application [CTA]) and ethics application 
in the Member State.  Poor recruitment (recruiting less than the anticipated number in the 
CTA) by  a Member State is not a reason for premature termination but is considered a 
normal conclusion to the study in that Member State.
13.2. End of Trial in all other Participating Countries
End of Trial in all other participating countries is defined as Last Patient Last Visit.
14.SPONSOR DISCONTINUAT ION CRITERIA
Premature termination of this study  may  occur because of a re gulatory  authority  decision, 
change in opinion of the IRB/EC, or investigational product safety  problems, or at the 
discretion of Pfizer.  In addition, Pfizer retains the right to discontinue development of 
avelumab at an y time.
If a stud y is prematurel y terminated or discontinued, Pfizer will promptly  notify  the 
investigator.  After notification, the investigator must contact all participating patients and 
the hospital pharmacy  (if applicable) within 1 month.  As directed by  Pfizer, all study  
materials must be collected and all CRFs completed to the greatest extent possible.

results of studies on www.clinicaltrials.gov (ClinicalTrials.gov), the European Clinical Trials 
Database (EudraCT), and or www.pfizer.com, and other public registers in accordance with 
applicable local laws/regulations. 
In all cases, stud y results are reported b y Pfizer in an objective, accurate, balanced, and 
complete manner and are reported regardless of the outcome of the stud y or the country in 
which the study  was conducted.
www.clinicaltrials.gov
Pfizer posts clinical trial US Basic Results on www.clinicaltrials.gov for Pfizer -sponsored 
interventional studies conducted in patients that evaluate the safet y and/or efficacy of a Pfizer 
product, regardless of the geographical location in which the study is conducted.  US Basic 
Results are submitted for posting within 1 year of the primary  completion date for studies in 
adult populations or within 6 months of the primary completion date for studies in pediatric 
populations. 
Primary  completion date is defined as the date that the final patient was examined or received 
an intervention for the purposes of final collection of data for the primary  outcome, whether 
the clinical study  concluded according to the prespecified protocol or was terminated.

Adapted from E.A. Eisenhauer, et al. New response evaluation criteria in solid tumours: 
Revised RECI ST guideline (version 1.1).  European Journal of Cancer 45 (2009) 228–247. 
CATEGORIZING LESIONS AT BASELINE
Measurable Lesions 
Lesions that can be accurately  measured in at least one dimension.
Lesions with longest diameter twice the slice thickness and at least 10 mm or greater 
when assessed b y CT or MRI  (slice thickness 5-8 mm).
Lesions with longest diameter at least 20 mm when assessed by  Chest X -ray. 
Superficial lesions with longest diameter 10 mm or greater when assessed by  caliper. 
Malignant l ymph nodes with the short axis 15 mm or greater when assessed by  CT.
NOTE: The short axis is used as the diameter for malignant lymph nodes, longest axis 
for all other measurable lesions. 
Non-measurable disease 
Non-measurable disease includes lesions too small to be considered measur able (including 
nodes with short axis between 10 and 14.9 mm) and truly  non-measurable disease such as
pleural or pericardial effusions, ascites, inflammatory breast disease, leptomeningeal disease, 
lymphangitic involvement of skin or lung, clinical lesion s that cannot be accurately  measured 
with calipers, abdominal masses identified b y physical exam that are not measurable b y 
reproducible imaging techniques.
Bone disease: Bone disease is non-measurable with the exception of soft tissue 
components that can be evaluated by  CT or MRI and meet the definition of 
measurability  at baseline. 
Previous local treatment: A previously  irradiated lesion (or lesion subjected to other 
local treatment) is non -measurable unless it has progressed since completion of 
treatment.
Normal sites
Cystic lesions: Simple cysts should not be considered as malignant lesions and should 
not be recorded either as target or non -target disease.  Cy stic lesions thought to 
represent cy stic metastases can be measurable lesions, if they  meet the specific 
definition above.  If non -cystic lesions are also present, these are preferred as target 
lesions.

PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL
Page 138Normal nodes: Nodes with short axis <10 mm are considered normal and should not 
be recorded or followed either as measurable or non -measurable disea se.
RECORDING TUMOR ASSESSMENTS 
All sites of disease must be assessed at baseline.  Baseline assessments should be done as 
close as possible prior to study  start.  For an adequate baseline assessment, all required scans 
must be done within 28 days prior t o randomization and all disease must be documented 
appropriatel y.  If baseline assessment is inadequate, subsequent statuses generall y should be 
indeterminate. 
Target lesions
All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ, 5 lesions in tota l, 
representative of all involved organs, should be identified as target lesions at baseline.  
Target lesions should be selected on the basis of size (longest lesions) and suitability  for 
accurate repeated measurements.  Record the longest diameter for eac h lesion, except in the 
case of pathological l ymph nodes for which the short axis should be recorded.  The sum of 
the diameters (longest for non -nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) for all target lesions 
at baseline will be the basis for compariso n to assessments performed on study . 
If two target lesions coalesce the measurement of the coalesced mass is used.  If a large target 
lesion splits, the sum of the parts is used.
Measurements for target lesions that become small should continue to be reco rded.  If a 
target lesion becomes too small to measure, 0 mm should be recorded if the lesion is 
considered to have disappeared; otherwise a default value of 5 mm should be recorded.
NOTE: When nodal lesions decrease to <10 mm (normal), the actual measurem ent 
should still be recorded.
Non-target disease 
All non-measurable disease is non- target.  All measurable lesions not identified as target 
lesions are also included as non -target disease.  Measurements are not required but rather 
assessments will be expressed as ABSENT, INDETERMI NATE, PRESENT/NOT 
INCREASED, INCREASED.  Multiple non- target lesions in one organ may  be recorded as a 
single item on the case report form (eg, ‘multiple enlarged pelvic l ymph nodes’ or ‘multiple 
liver metastases’).
OBJECTIVE RESPONSE STATUS AT EACH EVALUATION 
Disease sites must be assessed using the same technique as baseline, including consistent 
administration of contrast and timing of scanning.  I f a change needs to be made the case 
must be discussed with the radiologist t o determine if substitution is possible.  If not, 
subsequent objective statuses are indeterminate.

Page 139Target disease
Complete Response (CR): Complete disappearance of all target lesions with the 
exception of nodal disease.  All target nodes must decrease to normal size (short axis 
<10mm).  All target lesions must be assessed.
Partial Response (PR): Greater than or equal to 30% decrease under baseline of the 
sum of diameters of all target measurable lesions. The short diameter is used in the 
sum for target nodes, while the longest diameter is used in the sum for all other target 
lesions.  All target lesions must be assessed. 
Stable: Does not qualify  for CR, PR or Progression.  All target lesions must be 
assessed.  Stable can follow PR only  in the rare case that the sum increases by  less 
than 20% from the nadir, but enough that a previously  documented 30% decrease no 
longer holds. 
Objective Progression (PD): 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target 
meas urable lesions above the smallest sum observed (over baseline if no decrease in 
the sum is observed during therap y), with a minimum absolute increase of 5 mm. 
Indeterminate.  Progression has not been documented, and 
One or more target measurable lesions have not been assessed; 
or
Assessment methods used were inconsistent with those used at baseline;
or
One or more target lesions cannot be measured accuratel y (eg, poorly visible 
unless due to being too small to measure);
or
One or more target lesions were excised or irradiated and have not reappeared or 
increased. 
Non-target disease
CR: Disappearance of all non- target lesions and normalization of tumor marker 
levels.  All ly mph nodes must be ‘normal’ in size (<10 mm short axis).
Non-CR/Non -PD: Persistence of any  non-target lesions and/or tumor marker level 
above the normal limits. 
PD: Unequivocal progression of pre- existing lesions. Generally  the overall tumor 
burden must increase sufficiently  to merit discontinuation of therapy .  In the presence 
MSB0010718C
B9991001
Final Protocol Amendment 6, 0 8March 2021
PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL
Page 140of SD or PR in target disease, progression due to unequivocal increase in non -target 
disease should be rare. 
Indeterminate: Progression has not been determined and one or more non -target sites 
were not assessed or assessment methods were inconsistent with those u sed at 
baseline.
New Lesions 
The appearance of an y new unequivocal malignant lesion indicates PD.  If a new lesion is 
equivocal, for example due to its small size, continued assessment will clarify  the etiology .  
If repeat assessments confirm the lesion, then progression should be recorded on the date of 
the initial assessment.  A lesion identified in an area not previously scanned will be 
considered a new lesion.
Supplemental Investigations
If CR determination depends on a residual lesion that decreased i n size but did not disappear 
completely , it is recommended the residual lesion be investigated with biopsy  or fine needle 
aspirate.  If no disease is identified, objective status is CR.
If progression determination depends on a lesion with an increase poss ibly due to necrosis, 
the lesion may  be investigated with biopsy  or fine needle aspirate to clarify status. 
Objective/Subjective Progression
Patients requiring discontinuation of treatment without objective evidence of disease 
progression should not be reported as PD on tumor assessment CRFs.  This should be 
indicated on the end of treatment CRF as off treatment due to Global Deterioration of H ealth 
Status.  Every  effort should be made to document objective progression even after 
discontinuation of treatment.

Determination of Best Overall Response
The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment until 
disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest sum 
on study ).  For CR and PR, t he patient’s best response assignment wil l depend on the 
achievement of both measurement and confirmation criteria.  CR and PR must be confirmed 
by 2measurements at least 4 weeks apart.  In the case of SD, follow up measurements must 
have met the SD criteria at least once after stud y entry  at a minimum interval of 6 weeks.

Page 147Appendix 6.Alternative Measures During Public Emergencies
Thealternative study  measures described in this section areto be followed during public 
emergencies, including the COVID -19 pandemic. This appendix applies for theduration of 
the COVID -19 pandemic globall y and will become effective for other public emer gencies 
only upon written notification from Pfizer. 
Use of these alternative study  measures is expected to cease upon the return of business as 
usual (including the lifting of an y quarantines and travel bans/advisories). 
1.1. Telehealth Visits
In the event that in-clinic study  visits cannot be conducted, every  effort should be made to 
follow up on the safet y ofstudy participants at scheduled visits per the Schedule of 
Activities or unscheduled visits. Telehealth visits may be used to continue to asses s 
participant safety  and collect data points. Telehealth includes the exchange of healthcare 
information and services via telecommunication technologies (e.g., audio, video, video -
conferencing software) remotely, allowing the participant and the investigat or to 
communicate on aspects of clinical care, including medical advice, reminders, education, and 
safet y monitoring. The following assessments must be performed during a telehealth visit, if 
applicable as per the SOA in effect at the time of the visit:
Review and record an y AEs and SAEs since the last contact. Refer to protocol 
Section 8.3 .
Review and record an y new concomitant medications or changes in concomitant 
medications since the last contact.
Review and record contraceptive method and results of pregnancy testing (Arm A 
only). Confirm that the participant is adhering to the contraception method(s) required 
in the protocol. Refer to Section 1.2.1 of this appendix regarding pregnancy tests.
ECOG PS 
Patient Rep orted Outcomes
Survival Assessment
Study  participants must be reminded to promptl ynotify site staff about an y change in their 
health status.
1.2.Alternative Facilities for Safety Assessments
1.2.1.Laboratory Testing
If a stud y participant is unable to visit the site for protocol- specified safety  laboratory  
evaluations, testing may beconducted at a local laboratory  if permitted by local 
regulations. The local laboratory  may  be a standalone institution or within a hospital. The 
following safet y labora tory evaluations may  be performed at a local laboratory :  
Required laboratory  safety  assessments as per protocol Section 7.1.3 .
MSB0010718C
B9991001
Final Protocol Amendment 6, 0 8March 2021
PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL
Page 148If a local laboratory  is used, qualified stud y site personnel must order, receive, and review 
results. Site staff must collect thelocal laboratory  reference ranges and certifications/
accreditations for filing at the site. Laboratory test results are to be provided to the site staff 
as soon as possible . The local laboratory  reports should be  filed in the participant’s source 
documents/medical records. Relevant data from the local laboratory  report should 
be recorded on the CRF.  
If a participant requiring pregnancy  testing cannot visit a local laboratory  for pregnancy  
testing , a home urine pregnancy  testing kit with a sensitivity  of at least 25 mI U/mL may  be 
used by  the participant to perform the test at home, if compliant with local regulatory  
requirements. The pregnancy  test outcome should be documented in the participant’s source 
documents/medical records and relevant data recorded on the CRF. Confirm that the 
participant is adhering to the contraception method(s) required in the protocol.
1.3.Study Intervention
If the safet y of a trial participant is at risk because they cannot complete required evaluations 
or adhere to critical mitigation steps, then discontinuing that participant from study  
intervention must be considered.
Avelumab cannot be administered outside of the investigational site. If the patient cannot 
visit the site, the infusion will be omitted.
The following is recommended for the administration of avelumab for participants who have 
active confirmed (positive by  regulatory  authority -approved test) or presumed (test 
pending/clinical suspicion) SARS- CoV2 i nfection:
For s ymptomatic participants with active SARS -CoV2 infection, avelumab should be 
delay ed for at least 14 day s from the start of s ymptoms. This delay  is intended to allow 
the resolution of sy mptoms of SARS -CoV2 infection.
Prior to restarting treatment, the participant should be afebrile for 72 hours, and SARS -
CoV2- related s ymptoms should have recovered to ≤ Grade 1 for a minimum of 72 
hours.  Notify  the study  team when treatment is restarted.
Continue to consider potential drug-drug interactions for any concomitant medication 
administered for treatment of SARS -CoV2 infection.
1.4. Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events
If a participant has COVID -19 during the study , this should be reported as an adverse event 
(AE) or serious adverse events (SAE) and appropriate medical intervention provided.
Temporary  discontinuation of the study  intervention may  be medicall y appropriate until the 
participant has recovered from COVID -19.
1.5.Efficacy Assessments
Survival: Collection asperSOA should continue for study  patients in Follow -up.

requirements attheinvestigational site/facilities to the extentpossible.
If a different imaging facility  is used, please notify  the site monitor and update the 
form FDA 1572 as appropriate. 
The investigational site should advise the imaging facility  to obtain the images 
consistent with the study  ‘Imaging Acquisition Guideline s’ and to transmit the 
resulting images to the investigational site.
Patient -Reported Outcome: In the event that study  patients cannot come to the site for 
in-clinic visits, these assessments should be performed remotel y (eg, via telephone ).  The 
study  site staff performing the remote visit are to read the instructions, questions, and 
response choices verbatim and mark the response choice selected b y the study  patient. 
Conduct this telephone call in a quiet, private area and ask the patient to also go to a
place where they  are alone (ie, no one else around and/or able to provide input or 
influence their responses).
Please read the full text including all instructions, questions, and response options. 
Please ensure you are speaking clearl y and at a comfortable pace. Also, let the study  
patient know that y ou can re -read the instructions, question, or response options at 
any time.
Do not interpret an y part of the questionnaire for the study  patient. If the study  patient 
does not understand, please repe at the question and response choices verbatim and 
ask them to select the response that they  feel best represents his/her experience. 
Confirm the study  patient’s response selection before y ou record the answer (eg, you 
would like me to select “moderate pai n”, is that right?) .
Indicate on the paper questionnaire that it was performed via remote visit (eg, via 
telephone). Include the name of the study site staff performing the remote visit and 
confirm that the study  patient was the one to answer the questions.
Add an Investigator Comment on both PRO questionnaire CRFs to indicate “Assisted 
due to COVID -19.”
1.6.Patient Discontinuation
Required in- clinic visits, including Avelumab administrations, may  be missed without 
causing discontinuation from the maintenance treatment phase of the stud y. However, 
all study  patient withdrawal criteria listed in Protocol Section 6.5 remain applicable.
For s tudy patient discontinuation reporting in the CRF: select the most appropriate 
status for discontinuation; if the discontinuation is associated with the current 
COVID -19 pandemic, enter “COVID -19” in the “Specify  Status” field.

Footnotes for SCHEDULE OF ACTIVITI ESFOR SCREENING AND STUDY TREATMENT PERIOD
1. Visit Identifiers: All assessments should be performed prior to dosing with avelumab unless otherwise indicated.  Cycle CR1 Day 1 pre-dose assessments completed 
within 7 days prior to dosing do not need to be repeated unless clinically indicated.  Acceptable time windows for performing each assessment are described in the 
column headers.  Note : laboratory tests may be performed up t o 3 days prior to the scheduled clinic visit so that results will be available for review.
2. Informed Consent: Must be obtained prior to undergoing any study -specific procedure.  
3. Baseline Signs/Symptoms: To be recorded on Cycle CR1 Day 1.  Patients will b e asked about any signs and symptoms experienced within the 14 days prior to Cycle 
CR1 Day 1 .
4. Physical Exam ination: Includes an examination of major body systems.  
5. Vital Signs and Weight: Vital signs to include blood pressure and pulse rate, which should be taken prior to study drug dosing (if applicable) and with the patient in the 
seated position after the patient has been sitting quietly for at least 5 minutes.  
Weight should be measured at each visit as indicated.  Weight should be measured wit hin 3 days prior to each dose of avelumab (for determination of the avelumab dose 
[mg]).
6. Contraception Check: Female patients who are of childbearing potential will need to affirm that they meet the criteria for correct use of the sele cted methods of 
contraception.  The investigator or his or her designee will discuss with the patient the need to use the selected contraception methods consistently and correctly and 
document such conversations in the patient’s chart.  In addition, the investigator or his or her designee will instruct the p atient to call immediately if the selected 
contraception methods are discontin ued, or if pregnancy is known or suspected in the patient or the male patient’s partner.  See Section 4.3.1 .
7. Coagulation, Hematology, and Blood Chemistry (full panel) : Required tests are listed in Table 6.  Full chemistry panel is required at Screening, Cycle CR1 Day 1, 
Cycle CR1 Day 15, Cycle CR2 Day 1, Cycle CR3 Day 1, and Day 1 of every 2 cycles (8 weeks) thereafter.  May also be performed when clinically indicated.  If full and 
core chemistry panels are scheduled at the same visit, only the full chemistry will be perfo rmed.  
8. Blood Chemistry (core panel) : Core chemistry panel (required tests are listed in Table 6) is required at each clinic visit at which a full chem istry panel is not required.

Page 1569. Thyroid Function and ACTH Tests: Free T4, TSH, and ACTH tests will be performed at screening, Cycle CR3 Day 1, and Day 1 of every 2 cycles (8 weeks) thereafter.  
Additional tests should be performed when clinically indicated.   See Table 6.
10. Serum/Urine Pregnancy Test: For female patients of childbearing potential, a serum pregnancy test, with sensitivity of at least 25 mIU/mL, will be performed on two 
occasions prior to starting avelumab: once at the start of screening and once at the Cycle CR1 Day 1 visit immediately before study treatment administration.  Additional 
pregnancy tests (serum or urine) will also be routinely repeated prior to each avelumab dose during the active treatment period, at the End of Treatment/Withdrawal visit, 
and additionally whenever one menstrual cycle is missed or when potential pregnancy is otherwise suspected.  Additional pregn ancy tests may a lso be undertaken if 
requested by Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Ethics Committees (ECs) or if required by local regulations.  Results of the pr egnancy test should be available prior to each 
dosing.  See Section 7.1.1 .
11. Cardiac Troponin (cTn): Measurement of cTnT is preferred; however, cTnI may be substituted where cTnT is not available at the local laboratory.  The same subunit 
(cTnT or cTnI) measured during screening should be measured consistently throughout the study for any given patient.  During screening, clinically significant positive 
results should be further a ssessed as per local standard of care to rule out concurrent cardiac conditions which could make the patient ineligible for t he study per the 
exclusion criteria.  During the study, clinically significant new elevations suggestive of myocarditis should be a ssessed as per Table 5.  Additional tests should also be 
performed when clinically indicated .  See Table 6.
12. Urinalysis : Required only at Screening and End of Treatment.  To be performed as clinically indicated at other time points.  Required tests are listed in Table 6.
13. 12-Lead Electrocardiogram (ECG): A single ECG measurement is required at screening.  Additional ECGs may be performed as clinically indicated.  Clinically 
significant new findings seen on follow -up ECGs should be recorded as adverse events.
14. Tumor Assessments: Tumor assessments will be performed according to the local standard of care and when progression is suspected, however the tu mor assessment data 
will no longer be entered into the CRF nor submitted for central imaging review.
15. Adverse Events: Adverse events (AE) should be documented and recorded at each visit using National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse 
Events (CTCAE) version 4.03.  For serious adverse events (SAEs), the active reporting period to Pfizer or its designated representative begins from the time that the 
patient provides informed consent, which is obtained prior to the patient’s participation in the study, ie, prior to undergoi ng any study -related procedure and/or receiving 
study treatment, through and including 90 calendar days after the last administration of the study treatment.  SAEs occurring to a patient after the active reporting period 
has ended should be reported to the sponsor if the investigator becomes aware of them; at a minimum, all SAEs that the investigator believes have at least a reasonable
possibility of being related to study treatment are to be reported to the sponsor.
AEs (serious and non -serious) should continue to be recorded on the Case Report Form (CRF) through and including 90 calendar days after the last administration of 
avelumab.
If a patient begins a new anticancer therapy, the AE reporting period for non -serious AEs ends at the time the new treatment is started.  Death must be reported if it occurs 
during the SAE reporting period after the last dose of study treatment, irrespective of any intervening treatment.
16. Concom itant Medications/Treatments : Concomitant medications and treatments should continue to be recorded through and up to 90 days after the last dose of avelumab.  
If a patient begins a new anti-cancer therapy, reporting of concomitant medications should end at the time the new cancer th erapy is started; see Section 5.9 for additional 
details.  All concomitant medications will be recorded in the CRF including supportive care drugs (eg, anti-emetic treatment and prophylaxis), the drugs used to tre at 
adverse events or chronic diseases, and non -drug supportive interventions (eg, transfusions).  Concomitant medications should be reviewed at each study visit, and any 
prohibited treatments (as described in Section 5.9)should be discussed with the patient and appropriately managed. 
17. Avelumab Treat ment:Avelumab (10 mg/kg) will be given as a 1-hour intravenous infusion every 2 weeks.  Patients should be weighed within 3 days prior to each dose 
of avelumab (for d etermination of the avelumab dose [mg]).  All safety assessments must be performed and results reviewed by the treating physi cian prior to avelumab 
administration.  Patients with disease progression who are continuing to derive clinical benefit from study treatment will be eligible to continue with avelumab provided 
that the treating physician has determined that the benefit/risk for doing so is favorable (See Section 5.4.1 ). 
18. Best supportive care (BSC) : See Section 5.8.  All BSC components must comply with the permitted medications described in this protocol (see Section 5.9 ).

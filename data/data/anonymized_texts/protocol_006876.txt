Study design  A multi -center, randomized, doub le-blind, two treatment cycle, crossover study  in 
adolescent and adult female patients with primary dysmenorrhea  of at least moderate 
pain.  The study  consists of a 21 day Screening Phase and two Treatment Periods  
within Treatment Phase.  Qualified patients will be randomized in a 1:1 crossover 
fashion (A:B or B:A) to a single dose of naproxen sodium 440 mg (two tablets of 220

3. Introduction  
Background  
Primary dysmenorrhea (painful menstrua l cramping  that occurs during menses) is a common 
problem experienced by women in their reproductive years. In a study to determine the 
prevalence of dysmenorrhea in reproductive -age women, 36% reported always or often 
having pain with their menstrual periods and 90 % of the women reported to have some degree 
of dysmenorrhea.[ 1] This type of pain can interfere significantly with their daily activities. 
The patho physiology of the condition is primarily prostaglandin driven. At the beginning of 
menses, prostaglandins are released and play a major role in inducing uterine contractions 
within the female reproductive system. These contractions lead to uterine ischemia  which  
stimulate s pain neurons  resulting in pain. The severity of pain has been studied and correlated 
with the level of menstrual prostanglandin.[ 2]  
 
Naproxen sodium is a non -selective cyclooxygenase inhibitor and ultimately inhibits 
prostaglandins. Aleve® (naproxen sodium) is available over -the-counter and is indicated for 
temporary relief of minor aches and pains due to various pain states, including menstrual 
cramps. Tylenol® Extra Strength (acetaminophen) is also available over -the-counter and is 
indicated to temporarily relieve minor aches and pains due to premenstrual and menstrual 
cramps.  
 
The purpose of this study is to compare the max imum single dose of Aleve® (two tablets, 
equivalent to 440 mg of naproxen sodium) to the maximum single dose of Tylenol Extra 
Strength (two tablets, equivalent to 1000 mg of acetaminophen) in the treatment of primary 
dysmenorrhea.  
Benefit -risk assessment  
 
Patients with at least moderate pain due to primary dysmenorrhea who would typically take 
over-the-counter NSAIDs for pain relief will be enrolled in this study.  The two menstrual 
cycle treatment design falls with in established treatment guidelines.  Pati ents who experience 
a treatment failure have the option of taking rescue medication for pain relief.  
 
During the study, patients will be closely monitored for the occurrence  of adverse events.  
Weighing between the potential risks of OTC analgesics associated with the study, and given 
the ability to mitigate risks through close monitoring, this study is considered clinically and 
ethically acceptable.

4. Study objectives  
Primar y 
 The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the analgesic efficacy of a maximum 
single dose of two tablets of Aleve (2 x naproxen sodium 220 mg; total dose 440 mg) 
as compared to two tablets of Tylenol Extra Strength (2 x acetaminophen 500 mg; 
total dose 1000 mg) for t he treatment of menstrual cramping  pain associated with 
primary dysmenorrhea.  
Secondary  
 To evaluate the safety and tolerability of naproxen sodium and acetaminophen.

5. Study design  
Design Overview  
This is a multi -center, randomized , double -blind, two treatment  cycle , crossover study  in 
adolescent and adult female patients with primary dysmenorrhea.  At the completion of the 
Screening phase, eligible patients will be randomized in a 1:1 crossover fashion (A :B or B :A) 
to a single dose  of naproxen sodium 440 mg (two tablets of 220 mg [Treatment A]) and a 
single dose of acetaminophen 1000 mg (two tablets of 500 mg [Treatment B]).  
The study  consists of a 21 day Screening Phase and two Treatment  Periods within the 
Treatment Phase.  The st udy center may schedule screening testing on multiple days as 
needed , provided all screening tests are done within 21 days.  Qualified patients will be 
randomized into one of two treatment sequences.  Approximately 260 patients will be 
screened prior to th e first Treatment period during the Treatment Phase.  Approximately 200 
patients will be randomized to a specific treatment sequence.  
 
Screening Phase Visit 1 - (Day -21 to -1) 
 
Eligible patients will be selected within a screening period of 21 days prior to the start of the 
first Treatment Period within the Treatment Phase of the study .  Patients will be questioned in 
order to determine the severity of menstrual pain (at least moderate pain on a categorical pain 
intensity scale in order to be included) experienced  in past menstrual cycles prior to 
randomization in the study.  
 
After the successful completion of screening procedures, patients will be randomized into one 
of two treatment sequences.  In addition, each patient will receive a treatment kit, pregnancy 
test kits and e-diary . The patients  will receive training on the use  of the e -diary in addition to 
instructions  on how to take their assigned medication .  Automatic reminders will be set up in 
the e -diary to instruct patients to c omplete the assessments as needed.   
 
During both Treatment Periods, patients will be instructed to discontinue use of all pain 
medications including supplements, topical heat or cold, and other products of topical 
application  approximately  three days befo re the expected first day of menstruation of their 
menstrual cycle  and throughout the dosing/assessment period .  
 
Treatment Period 1  
 
After completion of screening and randomization, patients will start the first of two Treatment 
Periods.  This part of the  Treatment Phase will vary from patient to patient depending on the 
duration of their menstrual cycle (in days) and when the menstrual cycle started with respect 
to randomization.  Patients will be instructed to use their e -diary when they think they are 
close to approaching the first day of their menstrual cycle.  Patients will discontinue the use of 
all pain medications including supplements, topical heat or cold, and other products of topical 
application  appro ximately  three days before the expected first  day of menstruation  and 
throughout the treatment/assessment period . Once the patient ha s reached qualifying pain , the 
patient will notify the site through a phone call to the study center  before begin ning treatment .  
Patients  are only required to call and  leave a voice message.  Approval is not needed to 
proceed with the next steps . Patients will then perform a urine pregnancy test  and will take the 
designated treatment only if the pregnancy test is negative and when they feel their pain is ≥5

relief assessment  (0-10 NRS and the 0 -4 categorical pain relief scale)  at the designated time 
intervals using the e -diary over the next  12 hour time period . At 12 hours after t aking the 
study medication , patients will complete the Global Evaluation of the overall satisfaction with 
the effectiveness of the study medication. If the patient decides to take rescue medication  
prior to the 12 hours, the patient will be instructed to c omplete the Global Evaluation prior to 
taking the rescue medication . 
 
If the patient does not have sufficient menstrual pain intensity , has taken prohibited 
medications  within the specified period of 3 days , developed other confounding pain 
conditions,  or is not able to complete all assessments for the next 12 hours, then Treatment 
Period 1 can be extended to  the next menstrual cycle. Patients must inform study staff if they 
require an extension and only one extension  for Treatment Period 1 is possible.  If the patient 
does not dose the study medication  within the next menstrual cycle (as part of the extension), 
then the patient will contact the study center immediately. The patient will proceed to Visit 2 
and if eligible, the patient will proceed to Trea tment Period 2.  
 
Visit 2 (after the completion of Treatment Period 1)  
 
Patients will return to the study center approximately one week  after use of study medication .   
On visit 2 , the p atient s will bring their used /unused  pregnancy test kit /s, treatment ki t and e -
diary for review.  Patients will be given the instructions for treatment period 2 if still eligible 
to participate in the study . 
 
Treatment Period 2  
 
Patients will be instructed to use their e -diary when they think they are close  to approaching 
the first day of their menstrual cycle.  Patients will discontinue use of all pain medications 
including supplements, topical heat or cold, and other products of topical application  
approximately  three days before the expected first day of menstruation  and throughout the 
treatment  /assessment period. Once the patient has  reached qualifying pain , the patient will

Figure 1 – Design Overview  
Justification of the design  
The study was designed to capture menstrual  pain in patient s who could benefit from the 
administration of an OTC analgesic .  OTC analgesics  are commonly used to treat the pain of 
dysmenorrhea  (3,4).  The dysmenorrhea  pain model ha s been widely studied in the approval 
of both prescription and OTC medications .  In this study, as in all pain studies, should a 
patient  not get sufficient pain relief from the investigational medical product ( IMP), then 
rescue medication may be used.

6.3  Justification of selection criteria  
The selection criteria are chosen to ensure that patient s with specific risks for administration 
of the study medication and/or patient s with conditions which may have an impact on the 
safety of the patient or data integrity during their participation in the study are excluded.  
6.4 Withdrawal of patient s from study  
6.4.1 Withdrawal  
Withdrawal criteria  
Patient s must  be withdrawn from the study if any of the following occurs : 
 At their own request or at the request of their legally acceptable representative . At any 
time during the study and without giving reasons, a patient  may decline to participate 
further.  The patient  will not suffer any disadvantage as a result.  
Patient s may be withdrawn from the study if any of the following occurs:  
 Serious adverse events ; 
 If, in the Investigator's opinion, continuation of the study would be harmful to the 
patient 's well -being;  
 At the specific request of the Sponsor and in liaison with the Investigator (e.g. , 
obvious non -compliance, safety concerns);  
 Protocol violati on: if the patient  develops conditions which would have prevented her 
entry into the study according to the inclusion/exclusion criteria, she must be 
withdrawn immediately if safety is concerned; in other cases, the investigator will 
decide whether there i s a conflict with the study objectives  
Depending on the time point of withdrawal, a withdrawn patient  is referred to as either a 
“screening failure ” “Inadequate pain reporter ” or “dropout ” as specified below:  
Screening failure  
A patient  who, for any reason ( e.g., failure to satisfy the selection criteria), terminates the 
study prior to randomization is regarded as a “screening failure”.  
Re-starting the defined set of screening procedures  (re-screening)  to enable the “screening 
failure” patient’s  participation at a later time point is not allowed – with the following 
exceptions:  
 The patient  had successfully passed the screening procedures, but could not start 
subsequent treatment on schedule.  
 Initial screening occurred too early to complet e the required washout period after prior 
therapy.  
 The in - / exclusion criteria preventing the patient’s  initial attempt to participate have 
been changed (via protocol amendment).

Supplement: Version 9 
 Other situations where the patient had to withdraw consent due to “life circumstances” 
though they otherwise qualified.  These situations will be considered on a case by case 
basis by the sponsor or sponsor representative in consultation with the investigator.  
In any case, the investigator has to ensure that the repeated scree ning procedures do not 
expose the patient  to an unjustifiable health risk .  In addition , for re -screening , the patient  has 
to re-sign the  informed consent  form, e ven i f it was not changed after the patient’s  previous 
screening . 
Inadequate pain reporter  
A patient who is successfully screened and eligible for treatment but do es not  meet the 
minimum NRS pain threshold (≥5).  
Dropout  
A patient  who discontinues study participation prematurely for any reason is defined as a 
“dropout” if the patient  has been ra ndomized and administered  at least one dose of study 
medication . 
General procedures  
In all cases, the reason for withdrawal must be recorded in the case report form/electronic 
case report form (CRF/eCRF)  data collection system  and progress noted in the patient 's 
medical records.   
The patient  may object to the generation and processing of post -withdrawal data as specified 
in Section  13.4. 
Details for the premature termination of the study as a whole (or components thereof) are 
provided in Section  12 (Premature termination of the Study ). 
6.4.2 Repla cement  
Patient s who prematurely discontinue participation after randomization will not be replaced.  
6.5 Patient  identification  
Each patient  is identified by the study site’s unique patient  identification code. After informed 
consent procedure every patient  is given a screening number (SNR). At the time point of 
randomization, patient s who meet the entry criteria will be sequentially assigned to a four-
digit number in ascending order (randomization number, RNR).   See Section  7.3.

7.3 Treatment assignment  
At the beginning of the first treatment period, after completion of the pre -treatment baseline 
procedures/ assessments, patient s who meet the entry criteria will be sequentially assigned to a 
unique number in ascending order (randomization number, RNR) according to the 
randomization schedule prepared prior to the study.  
Patient s will be number ed according to t he following scheme:  
14001XXXX  
Whereas the “Xs” will be replaced with a four digit sequentially assigned number as each 
patient  enters the study (e.g. , first patient  number will be 140011001 ). 
Once a number has been assigned to a patient , it cannot be reassigned to another patient .   
Patients entering the Treatment Phase are randomized in a 1:1 fashion into one of two blinded 
treatment sequences:  
 Naproxen sodium 440 mg (two tablets of naproxen sodium 220 mg) for Treatment 
Period 1 and ace taminophen 1000 mg (two tablets of acetaminophen 500 mg) for 
Treatment Period 2 (treatment sequence A/B);  
 Acetaminophen 1000 mg (two tablets of acetaminophen 500 mg) for Treatment Period 
1 and naproxen sodium 440 mg (two tablets of naproxen sodium 220 mg) for 
Treatment Period 2 (treatment sequence B/A).  
 
Patients will be reminded to discontinue use of all pain medications including supplements, 
use of topical heat or cold, and other products of topical application  approximately  72 hours 
before the patient’s  anticipated  initiation of the first day of menstruation of their cycle in each 
Treatment Period.  Patients will take the e -diary and treatment kit home and complete the 
questionnaires  when they think they are close  to approaching the first day of menstrua tion of 
their menstrual cycle . 
7.4 Dosage and administration  
Each patient  will self-administer the treatment at the onset of dysmenorrhea  during their 
menstrual cycle.  Depending  upon which treatment in the sequence, they could be either 
taking naproxen sodium (220 mg x 2) or acetaminophen (500 mg x 2).  Patient s will 
administer the study medication  with a full glass of non -refrigerated, non -carbonated wat er 
(about 8 ounces or 240 mL) .  The patient will enter  the d osing date and time into the e -diary 
at the time of study medication  administration.  
7.5 Blinding  
7.5.1 Blinding measures  
Patient s enrolled in the study , investigators and their staff involved in protocol procedures or 
data collection analysis will be blinded to the identity of the treatment  sequence . The study 
monitor will conduct product accountability during and after database lock. To preserve the 
blinding, all investigational products will be over encapsulated and prepackaged accordin g to 
the randomization  schedule and managed using IV/WRS.

7.5.2 Unblinding  
In the case of a medical emergency, such as serious adverse events (SAE), breaking the blind 
may become necessary during the study .  Randomization code -break envelopes are securely 
maintained at the study  site and with the Sponsor.  
In compliance with applicable regulations, in the event of a SUSAR related to the blinded 
treatment, the patient ’s treatment code will usually be unblinded before reporting to the health 
authorities, ethic committees and investigato rs (see Section 9.6.1.4 ). 
7.5.3 Emergency unblinding by the investigator  
The investigator will be provided with code -break envelopes that can be used to break the 
blinding of the study medication .  Any patient  who was unblinded using the code -break 
envelopes must have this occurrence document ed in the patient ’s medical record.  The 
investigator should notify the sponsor or sponsor medical monitor  prior to unblinding if at all 
possible , unless a delay in doing s o will deleteriously affect the patient ’s well being. The 
investigator must report the blind break in conjunction with a SAE as defined in Section 9.6.1 .  
Patient s that have been unblinded will not be included in the ITT or PP  efficacy analysis.  
The Sponsor will collect all code -break envelopes at the end of the study.  
7.6 Drug logistics and accountability  
The Sponsor will provide sufficient quantity of the IMP to the study site.  All study center s 
will dispense IMP according to the randomization schedule  entered in the IV/WRS.  
All study medication  will be stored at the investigational site in accordance wit h GCP 
requirements and the instructions given by the clinical supplies department of the sponsor (or 
its affiliate/CRO), and will be inaccessible to unauthorized personnel. Special storage 
conditions and a complete record of batch numbers and expiry dates can be found in the 
Sponsor’s study file; the site -relevant elements of this information will be available in the 
investigator site file. On the day of receipt, the responsible site personnel will confirm receipt 
of IMP in writing. The personnel will use t he IMP only within the framework of this clinical 
study and in accordance with this protocol. Receipt, distribution, return and destruction (if 
any) of the study medication  must be properly documented according to the sponsor’s agreed 
and specified procedu res. 
7.7 Treatment compliance  
The distribution  of the study medication will be supervised by a member of the Investigator’s 
team. Patients will self -adminster IMP at their discretion and document the dosing in the e -
diary system.  The study center will monitor  used and unused IMP for compliance.  Any 
discrepancies between actual and expected amount of returned study medication must be 
discussed with the patient  at the time of the visit, and any explanation must be documented in 
the source records.

9.2.2 Treatment period 1  
After screening, all Patients will start the first Treatment Period.  The start of treatment will 
vary based on when the patient’s last menstru al cycle occurred. Once the patient has  reached 
qualifying pain, the patient  will notify the site by a phone call to the study center and begin 
treatment .  Patients are only required to call and leave a voice message.  Approval is not 
needed to proceed with the next steps . The patient takes the assigned study medication  when 
menstrual cramp pain is ≥5 in severity using the 0 -10 Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) 
questionnaire.   
 
“My menstrual cramp pain at this time is …? ” 
 
If the patient designates that her m enstrual cramp pain is <5 on the NRS , has taken prohibited 
medications, developed ot her confounding pain conditions or does not have adequate time to 
finish 12 hours of evaluation, the patient should stop all activities and inform the study center 
immediat ely. 
 
Patients are allowed to continue on the study and Treatment Period 1 can be extended to the ir 
next menstrual cycle.  Patients must inform study staff if they require an extension and only 
one extension  for Treatment Period 1 is possible.  If the patie nt does not dose within the next 
menstrual cycle (as part of the extension) , then the patient will immediately contact the study 
center. The patient will proceed to Visit 2 and if eligible, the patient will proceed to Treatment 
Period 2.   
 
Prior to dosing all patients MUST perform a urine pregnancy test and verify that the 
results are negative (not pregnant).   Any patient who has a positive pregnancy test or is not 
sure of the results must contact the study center immediately.  Patients with a verified posi tive 
pregnancy test will be withdrawn from the study.

9.3 Population characteristics  
9.3.1 Demographic  
For basic patient  assessment prior to screening, some demographic information may be 
collected before obtaining written informed consent:  
 Year of birth ( approximate age); 
 Sex; 
 Native language.  
Collection of demographic information is subject to all applicable local regulations.  
9.3.2 Medical history  
Medical history findings ( i.e. previous diagnoses, diseases or surgeries) meeting all criteria 
listed below will be collected  as available to the investig ator:

9.3.3 Other baseline characteristics  
Information on smoking, as well as drug and alcohol consumption will be collected.  
9.4 Efficacy  analysis  
Patients may be invalid for one period but valid for another period. Therefore, invalidity for 
either period does not make them invalid for both. For example, if a patient did not dose in 
Treatment Period 1, but did dose in Treatment Period 2, then the dat a from Treatment Period 
2 will be analyzed.  The following incidences will be considered as a protocol violation and 
excluded from the PP analysis if any one of the following occurred during the treatment 
period:  
 Patient vomited within 30 minutes of ingesti ng the study medication;  
 
 Patient took rescue medication before the 2 -hour evaluation;  
 
 Patient does not have a baseline (predose) pain evaluation;

9.6.1 Adverse events  
9.6.1.1  Definitions  
Definition of adverse event (AE)  
In a clinical study, an AE is any untoward medical occurrence ( i.e. any unfavorable and 
unintended sign [including abnormal laboratory findings], symptom or disease) in a patient or 
clinical investigation subject after providing written informed consent for p articipation in the 
study.  Therefore, an AE may or may not be temporally or causally associated with the use of 
a medicinal (investigational) product.   
A surgical procedure that was planned prior to the start of the study by any physician treating 
the patient should not be recorded as an AE (however, the condition for which the surgery is 
required may be an AE).  
In the following differentiation between medical history and AEs, the term “condition” may 
include abnormal e.g., physical examinati on findings, s ymptoms, diseases . 
 Conditions that started before signing of informed consent and for which no symptoms 
or treatment are present until signing of informed consent  are recorded as medical 
history  (e.g., seasonal al lergy without acute complaints);  
 Conditions  that started before signing of informed consent and for which symptoms or 
treatment are present after signing of informed consent, at unchanged intensity , are 
recorded as medical history  (e.g., allergic pollinosis) ; 
 Conditions that started or deteriorated  after signing of informed consent will be 
documented as adverse events .  This includes intercurrent illnesses.  
Definition of serious adverse event (SAE)  
An SAE  is classified as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose, meets any of the 
following criteria (a  – f): 
a. Results in death  
b. Is life -threatening  
The term ‘life -threatening’ in the definition refers to an event in which the patient  was 
at risk of death at the time of the event, it does not refer to an event which 
hypothetically might have caused  death if it were more severe.

Final / Version 2 .0   16-Apr-2018  
  
 
Reference Number: BHC -RD-OI-107 
Supplement: Version 9 
c. Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
A hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization will not be regarded as an SAE if 
at least one of the following exceptions is met:  
- The admiss ion results in a hospital stay of less than 12  hours  
- The admission is pre -planned  
(e.g., elective or scheduled surgery arranged prior to the start of the study ; 
admission is part of the study procedure s as described in Section  9.2) 
- The admission is not associated with an AE  
(e.g., social hospitalization for purposes of respite care).  
However, it should be noted that invasive treatment during any hospitalization may 
fulfill the criterion of ‘medically important’ and as such may be reportable as an SAE 
dependent on clinical judgment.  In addition, where local regulatory authorities 
specifically require a more stringent definition, the local regulati on takes precedence.  
d. Results in persistent or significant disability / incapacity  
Disability  means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life’s 
functions.  
e. Is a congenital anomaly / birth defect  
f. Is another serious or important med ical event as judged by the investigator  
9.6.1.2  Classifications for adverse event assessment  
All AEs will be assessed and documented by the investigator according to the categories 
detailed below.   
9.6.1.2.1  Seriousness  
For each AE, the seriousness must be determined according to the criteria given in 
Section  9.6.1.1 . 
 Clinical Study Protocol 19737  Page 35 of 55  
Final / Version 2 .0   16-Apr-2018  
  
 
Reference Number: BHC -RD-OI-107 
Supplement: Version 9 
9.6.1.2.2  Intensity  
The intensity of an AE is classified according to the following categories:  
 Mild : Pres ents with signs and symptoms easily tolerated, does not need treatment, or 
prolonged hospitalization and does not necess arily require stopping the drug;  
 Moderate:  A type of adverse event that is usually alleviated with additional specific 
therapeutic inte rvention. The event interferes with usual activities of daily living, causing 
discomfort but poses no significant or permanent risk of harm to the research participant;  
 Severe: A type of adverse event that requires intensive therapeutic intervention. The event 
interrupts usual activities of daily living, or significantly affects clinical status. The event 
possesses a significant risk of harm to the research participant and hospitalization may be 
required.  
 
9.6.1.2.3  Causal relationship  
The assessment of the causal relationship between an AE and the administration of treatment 
is a decision to be made by the investigator , who is a qualified physician , based on all 
information available at the time  of the completion of the CRF/eCRF  data collection system . 
The assessment is based on the question whether there was a “reasonable causal relationship” 
to the study treatment in question.  
Possible answers are “yes” or “no”  
An assessment of “no” would include:  
1. The existence of a highly likely  alternative explanation , e.g., mechanical bleeding at 
surgical site.  
or 
2. Non-plausibility, e.g., the patient  is struck by an automobile when there is no 
indication that the drug caused disorientation that may have caused the event; cancer 
developing a few days after the first drug administration.  
An assessment of “yes” indicates that that the AE is reasonably associated with the use of the 
study treatment.  
Important factors to be considered in assessing the relationship of the AE to study treatment 
include:  
- The temporal sequenc e from drug administration:  The event should occur after the drug 
is given.  The length of time from drug exposure to event should be evaluated in the 
clinical context of the event.  
- Recovery on drug discontinuation (de -challenge), recurrence on drug re-introduction 
(re-challenge):   Patient ’s response after de -challenge or re -challenge should be considered 
in view of the usual clinical course of the event in question.  
- Underlying, concomitant, intercurrent diseases:   
Each event should be evaluated in t he context of the natural history and course of the 
disease being treated and any other disease the patient  may have.

Final / Version 2 .0   16-Apr-2018  
  
 
Reference Number: BHC -RD-OI-107 
Supplement: Version 9 
- Concomitant medication or treatment:  
The other drugs the patient  is taking or the treatment the patient  receives should be 
examined to de termine whether any of them might have  cause d the event in question.  
- Known response pattern for this class of drug: Clinical/preclinical  
- Exposure to physical and/or mental stresses: The exposure to stress might induce adverse 
changes in the recipient and p rovide a logical and better explanation for the event  
- The pharmacology and pharmacokinetics of the study treatment:  
The pharmacokinetic properties (absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion) of 
the study treatment, coupled with the individual patient’s pharmacodynamics should be 
considered.  
- The assessment is not possible  
Causal relationship to  protocol -required procedure(s)  
The assessment of a possible causal relationship between the AE and protocol -required 
procedure(s) is based on the question whether there was  a “reasonable causal relationship” to 
protocol -required procedure(s).  
Possible answers are “yes” or “no”  
9.6.1.2.4  Action taken with study treatment  
Any action on study treatment to resolve the AE is to be documented using the categories 
listed be low. 
The study treatment action should be recorded separately for each study treatment as detailed 
in the CRF/eCRF  data collection system . 
- Drug withdrawn  
- Drug interrupted  
- Dose reduced

9.6.1.2.6  Outcome  
The outcome of the AE is to be documented as follows:  
- Recovered/resolved  
- Recovering/resolving  
- Recovered/resolved with sequelae  
- Not recovered/not resolved  
- Fatal  
- Unknown  
9.6.1.3  Assessments and documentation of adverse events  
AEs observed, mentioned upon open questioning by a member of the investigator’s team or 
spontaneously reported by the patient  will be documented. The observation phase for AEs 
will start with signing the info rmed consent form and will end in general with the last visit of 
follow -up. After the end of follow -up there is no requirement to actively collect AEs.  
In case of ongoing AEs after the last follow -up visit – especially when related to treatment 
with the st udy medication – the respective AE will be followed until resolution, if possible. 
The type of information that should be assessed and recorded by the investigator for each AE 
is listed in Section  9.6.1.2 . 
For all SAEs the sponsor has to carry out a separate assessment for expectedness, seriousness 
and causal relationship to treatment with the study medication.  
The investigator has to record on the respective CRF/eCRF  data collection system  all adverse 
events occurring in the period between the signing of the informed consent and the end of the 
Follow -up Visit, there is no requirement to actively collect AEs incl uding deaths.  The type of 
information that should be assessed and recorded by the investigator for each AE is listed in 
Section  9.6.1.2 .   
“Death” should not be recorded as an AE on the AE page.  Instead, “death” is the outcome of 
underlying AE(s).  
For all serious adverse events (SAEs) the sponsor has to carry out a separate assessment for 
expectedness, seriousness and causal relationship to study medication . 
9.6.1.4  Reporting of serious  adverse events  and pregnancy  
The definition of serious adverse events (SAEs) is given in Section  9.6.1.1 .  Each SAE must 
be followed up until resolution or stabilization by submission of updated reports to the 
designated recipient.  
Investigator’s notification of the sponsor  
All investigators wil l be thoroughly instructed and trained on all relevant aspects of the 
investigator’s reporting obligations for SAEs.  This information, including all relevant contact 
details, is summarized in the investigator site file.  This information will be updated a s 
needed.  
The investigator  must report immediately (within 24  hours of the investigator’s awareness) a ll 
SAEs occurring during the observation period defined in Section  9.6.1.3  to the recipient

detailed in the instructions for SAE reporting included in the Investigator File .  For this , an 
AE page in the CRF/eCRF  data collection system  as well as the complementary pages 
provided in the Investigator File must be completed for each SAE .   
Pregnancy occurring during a clinical investigation, although not considered a serious adverse 
event, must be reported to Bayer within the same timelines as a serious adverse event on a 
Pregnancy Monitoring Form.  The  outcome of a pregnancy should be followed up carefully 
and any abnormal outcome of the mother or the child should be reported.  This also applies to 
pregnancies following the administration of the investigational product to the father prior to 
sexual inte rcourse.  Send the completed SAE or pregnancy forms to:  
 or Fax:  (in the USA)  
SAEs occurring after the protocol -defined observation period will be processed by the 
sponsor  according to all applicable regulations.  
Notification of the IRB 
Notification of the Institutional Review Board ( IRB) about all relevant events ( e.g., SAEs, 
suspected, unexpected, serious adverse reactions [SUSARs ]) will be performed by the 
sponsor and/or  by the investigator according to all applicable regulations.  
Notification of the authorities  
The processing and reporting of all relevant events ( e.g., SAEs, SUSARs) to the authorities 
will be done by the sponsor according to all applicable regulations.  
Sponsor’s notification of the investigational site  
The sponsor will inform the investigational site about reported relevant events ( e.g., SUSARs) 
according to all applicable regulations.  
9.6.1.5  Expected adverse events  
For this study, the applicable reference document is the most current version of the package 
insert for naproxen , acetaminophen  and ibuprofen .  If relevant new safety information is 
identified, the information will be integrated into an update of the safet y information  and 
distributed to all participating sites.  
The expectedness of AEs will be determined by the sponsor according to the applicable 
reference document and according to all local regulations.  
9.6.2 Pregnancies  
A patient ’s participation is to be termin ated immediately if a pregnancy is supposed  (i.e. 
in case her pregnancy test becomes positive).   
The investigator must report to the sponsor any pregnancy occurring in a female patient  
during her participation in this study.  The outcome of the pregnancy should be followed up 
carefully, and any outcome of the mother  and the child at delivery should be reported . 
For all reports, the forms provided are to be used.   The investigator  should submit  them  within  
the same timelines as an SAE (s ee Section  9.6.1.4 .).  Send the completed pregnancy forms to:

10. Statistical methods and determination of sample size  
10.1 General considerations  
Statistical analysis will be performed using SAS and the version used will be  specified in the 
Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) and placed on file.  The SAP will contain a more 
comprehensive explanation than described below of the methodology used in the statistical 
analyses.  The SAP will also contain the rules and data handling co nventions used to perform 
the analyses, and the procedure used for accounting for missing data.  
10.2 Analysis sets  
Three  populations will be identified in this study .  
Safety Population:  
 
All randomized patient who take at least one dose of IMP. Safety measure s will be analyzed 
for all patients in the safety population.  
 
 
Intent to Treat (ITT) Population:  
 
All patients who are randomized and provide at least one measure of an efficacy parameter 
after the first dose of IMP.   ITT population will be used as the sensitivity analysis for the 
selected parameters.   
 
 
Per Protocol (PP) Population  
 
PP population will include all patients in ITT who do not have any major protocol violations. 
PP population will be used as the primary  analysis for the efficacy parameters.  
 
10.3 Variables  and planned statistical analyses  
 
10.3.1  Imputation of missing values  
Pain intensity differences (PID) will be derived by subtracting the pain intensity at the post -
dose time point from the baseline intensity score (baseline score – post-baseline score).  A 
positive difference is indicative of improvement.   
If a patient tak es rescue medication during the 12 hour assessment period, the subsequent pain 
intensity scores following the intake of the rescue medication will be imputed by either the 
baseline score (pre -dose) or the score recorded immediately prior to taking rescue m edication, 
whichever is worse.  Subsequent pain relief scores following the intake of the rescue 
medication will be imputed by “none relief” (0).  
 
 Clinical Study Protocol 19737  Page 42 of 55  
Final / Version 2 .0   16-Apr-2018  
  
 
Reference Number: BHC -RD-OI-107 
Supplement: Version 9 
For those patients who are not rescued during the 12 hour assessment period, the 30 and 60 
minute assessments  will be considered as missing in the event that pain assessment is off -
schedule by more than 10 minutes.  Subsequent to the 1 hour reading values will be 
considered as missing in the event that the pain assessment is off -schedule by more than 15  
minutes.  Any missing values during 12 hour assessment period will be imputed using linear 
interpolation (trapezoid rule) or extrapolation (last observation carried forward) approach 
depending on availability of data surrounding the missing value.  
 
10.3.2  Primary endpoin t 
 
Total pain relief scores (TOTPAR) over 12 hours, will be calculated by multiplying the pain 
relief score at each post -dose time point by the duration (in hours) since the preceding time 
point and then summing these values.  
 
TOTPAR0 -12 will be analyzed u sing analysis of variance (ANOVA) for the cross -over study 
design.  
 
10.3.3  Secondary endpoint  
The secondary efficacy variables include:  
 Summed Pain Intensity Difference (SPID) over the 12 -hour study period (SPID 0-12) 
using 0 -10 NRS  
 SPID over 0 -6 hours (SPID 0-6)  
 SPID 6 -12 hours  (SPID6 -12) 
 TOTPAR over 0 -6 hours (TOTPAR 0-6) 
 TOTPAR 6 -12 hours  (TOTPAR6 -12) 
The above mentioned secondary endpoints will be analyzed similarly  as the primary endpoint.  
 Time to first intake of rescue medication. If a patient did not take the  rescue 
medication during the treatment period, she will be censored at the time of last 
assessment. Time to first use of rescue medication will be estimated and plotted using 
Kaplan -Meier method and analyzed using log -rank test.  
 Pain Intensity Difference (PID) scores at each evaluation. PIDs will be summarized 
descriptively  by treatment group and plotted over time.  
 Global Evaluation at 12 hours post -dose or immediately before first intake of rescue 
medication. This variable will be analyzed using CMH metho d with modified ridit 
score.   
Safety and Tolerability  
AEs will be collected from screening throughout the Treatment Phase and Follow -up Phase 
and will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities. Only treatment -
emergent AEs will be included, i.e., AEs that begin or worsen after the first dose  of the 
investigational medicinal product  (IMP) in the Treatment Phase.  The number and percent of 
patient s who experience any event and the number of events overall, by System Organ Class,

and b y Preferred Term will be displayed by treatm ent period and treatment group.  Tables will 
also be produced by severity and relationship to each IMP. Seriousness, severity, relationship 
to each IMP duration, and outcome will also be listed.  
Quantitative data  for blood pressure, heart rate, laboratory data, body weight, body 
temperature will be described by summary statistics for the original data as well as f or the 
differences to baseline.  Frequency tables will be provided for qualitative data. Laboratory 
data outside the reference range will be listed and highlighted with ‘L’ for low and ‘H’ for 
high. An additional table with all abnormal values will be presented.  
Listings of individual patient  data (e.g., vital signs) will be provided.  
10.4 Determination of samp le size  
The proposed design of the study is to detect the treatment difference of 5.9 in TOTPAR12 
with 90% power and a type I error of 0.05.  The required sample size to meet these design 
criteria are 154 patients in the PP population.  Assuming a 23% drop  out rate, approximately 
200 patients will need to be randomized.  
10.5 Planned interim analyses  
No interim analysis is planned for this study.

11. Data handling and quality assurance  
11.1 Data recording  
Data collection and storage  
The data collection tool for this study will be a validated electronic data capture system to be 
used at the study site. Patient  data necessary for analysis and reporting will be provided to the 
Sponsor in CDISC (Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consort ium) standards.  
Test results originating directly from the site (e.g. , urine drug screen) will be entered into the 
CRF/eCRF  data collection system by designated site personnel.  
Analytical results generated by central laboratory / -ies 
The analytical result s will be provided as electronic data files using predefined data formats. 
Where appropriate, these data will be supplemented with data already available from the 
CRF/eCRF  data collection system (e.g. , specific time points, demographic data) before being 
evaluated by the responsible specialist(s). Data relevant for the clinical study report will be 
stored in the sponsor’s validated data repository.  
Source documentation  
Entries made in the CRF/eCRF  data collection system must be either verifiable against source 
documents, or have been directly entered into the CRF/eCRF  data collection system, in which 
case the entry in the CRF/eCRF  data collection system will be considered as the source data 
(e.g., time points of blood sampling).  The site has to ensure the availability of all required 
documentation.  
Data recorded from screening failures  
Data of 'only screened patient s' will be recorded at least as source data, as far as the reason for 
the premature discontinuation is identifiable .  At minimum , the following  data should be 
recorded in the screening log : 
 Demographic information ( patient  number; year of birth   or age, sex);  
 Date of informed consent;  
   Reason for premature discontinuation ; 
   Date of last  visit.   
For screening failures with an SAE , the following data should be collected in the CRF/eCRF  
data collection system  in addition to the data specified above : 
 All information related to the SAE such as:  
- Concomitant medication

will contact the site prior to the start of the study to review with the site staff the protocol, 
study requirements, and their responsibilities to satisfy regulatory, ethical, and sponsor’s 
requirements .  When reviewing data collection procedures, the discussion will also include 
identification and documentation of source data items.  
The sponsor /designee wi ll monitor the site activity to verify that the:  
 Data  are authentic, accurate and complete .   
Supporting  data may be requested  (example: blood glucose readings to support  a 
diagnosis of diabetes ); 
 Safety and rights of patient s are being protected ; 
 Study is conducted in accordance with the currently approved protocol  
(including study treatment being used in accordance with the protocol) ; 
 Any oth er study agreements, GCP, and all applicable regulatory requirements are met.  
The investigator and the hea d of the medical institution (where applicable) agrees to allow the 
monitor direct  access to all relevant documents.  
11.3 Data processing  
Data will be collect ed as described in Section  11.1.  Clinical data management will be 
performed in accordance with applicable sponsor’s /CRO’s  standards and data cleaning 
procedures.  This is applicable for data recorded on the CRF/eCRF  data collection system as 
well as for data from other sources (e.g. , laboratory, ECG).  
For data coding  (e.g., AEs, medication), internationally recognized and accepted dictionaries 
will be used.  
11.4 Missing data  
Reasons for missing data, especially inability to perform a test, must be documen ted.  
Additional parameters for missing data are detailed in Section 10.3.1 . 
11.5 Audit and inspection  
To ensure compliance with GCP and regulatory requirements, a member of the sponsor’s (or a 
designated CRO’s) quality assurance unit may arrange to conduct an audit to assess the 
performance of the study at the study site and of the study documents originating there.  The 
investigator/institution will be informed of the audit outcome.  
In addition, inspections by regulatory health autho rity representatives and IRB(s) are possible.  
The investigator should notify the sponsor immediately of any such inspection.  
The investigator/institution agrees  to allow the auditor or inspector direct access to all relevant 
documents and allocate his/her time and the time of his/her staff to the auditor/inspector to 
discuss findings and any issues.  Audits and inspections may occur at any time during or after

13. Ethical and legal aspects  
13.1 Investigator(s) and other study personnel  
All other study personnel not included in this section are identified in a separate personnel list 
(not part of this cli nical study protocol) as appropriate.  This list will be updated as needed; an 
abbreviated version with personnel relevant for the centers will be available in each center’s 
investigator site file.  
Whenever the term ‘investigator’ is noted in the protocol text, it may refer to either the 
principal investigator at the site, or an appropriately qualified, trained and delegated 
individual of the investigational site.  
The principal investigator of each center must sign the protocol signature page and must 
recei ve all required external approvals (e.g ., health authority, ethics committee , sponsor ) 
before patient  recruitment may start at the respective center.  Likewise, all amendments to the 
protocol must be signed by the principal investigator and must have recei ved all required 
external approvals before coming into effect at the respective center.  
A complete list of all participating centers and their investigators, as well as all required 
signature documents, will be maintained in the sponsor’s study file. 
The global sponsor of this study is identified on the title page of this protocol.  If required by 
local law, local co -sponsors will be nominated; they will be identified on the respective 
country -specific signature pages.  
13.2 Funding and financial disclosure  
Fund ing 
This study will be funded by its sponsor.  
Financial disclosure  
Each investigator (including principal and/or any sub investigators ) who is directly involved 
in the treatment or evaluation of research patient s has to provide a financial disclosure 
according to all applicable legal requirements.  All relevant docu mentation will be filed in the 
Trial Master File. 
13.3 Ethical and legal conduct of the study  
The procedures set out in this protocol, pertaining to the conduct, evaluation, and 
documentation of this study, are designed to ensure that the sponsor and investigator abide by 
Good Clinical Practice (GCP) g uidelines and the guiding principles detailed in the 
Declaration of Helsinki.  The study will also be carried out in keeping with applicable local 
law(s) and regulation(s).  
Documented a pproval from appropriate IRBs will be obtained for all participating 
centers/countries before start of the study, according to GCP, local laws, regulations and 
organizations.  When necessary, an extension, amendment or renewal of the IRB approval 
must be obtained and also forwarded to the sponsor .  The responsible unit (e.g. , IRB, head of

Supplement: Version 9 
the study center/medical institution) must supply to the sponsor , upon request, a list of the 
EC/IRB members involved in the vote and a statement to confirm that the IRB is organized 
and operates according to GCP and applicable laws and regulations.  
Strict adherence to all specifications laid down in this protocol is required for all aspects of 
study conduct; the investigator may not mod ify or alter the procedures described in this 
protocol.   
Modifications to the study protocol will not be implemented by either the sponsor or the 
investigator without agreement by both parties.  However, the investigator or the sponsor may 
implement a dev iation from, or a change of, the protocol to eliminate an immediate hazard(s) 
to the study  patient s without prior IRB/sponsor approval/favorable opinion.  As soon as 
possible, the implemented deviation or change, the reasons for it and if appropriate the 
proposed protocol amendment  should be submitted to the IRB/ head of medical 
institution/ sponsor.  Any deviations from the protocol must be explained and documented by 
the investigator.  
Details on discontinuation of the entire study or parts thereof can be fo und in Section  12. 
13.4 Patient  information and consent /assent  
All relevant information on the study will be summarized in an integrated patient  information 
sheet and informed consent form provided by the sponsor o r the study center.  S ample patient  
information and informed consent /assent  form s are provided as a docum ent separate to this 
protocol.   Patients 15 to 17 years old who cannot legally give informed consent for research 
participation must use an IRB -approve d assent form and a Parental/Guardian informed 
consent form.   Informed consent must first be obtained from the child’s parent or legal 
guardian before assent may be obtained from the child.  
Based on this patient  information sheet, the investigator or desig nee will explain all relevant 
aspects of the study to each patient prior  to her entry into the study ( i.e. before any 
examinations and procedures associated with the selection for the study are performed or any 
study -specific data is recorded on study -specific forms).  
The investigator  will also mention that  written approval of the IRB  has been obtained.  
Each patient  will be informed about the following aspects of premature withdrawal:  
 Each patient  has the right to withdraw from the study at any ti me without any 
disadvantage and without having to pr ovide reasons for this decision;    
 The patient ’s consent covers examinations as specified in the visit description  described 
in Section  9.2.5  to be conducted after withdrawal of consent ; 
 The patient ’s data that have been collected until the time of withdrawal will be retained 
and statistically analyzed  in accordance with the statistical analysis plan; 
 Patient -specific data on the basis of material obtained before withdrawal may be 
generated after withdrawal (e.g. , image reading, analysis of biological specimen such as 
blood, urine or tissues); these data would also be retained and statistically ana lyzed in 
accordance with the statistical analysis plan.  The patient  has the right to object to the 
generation and processing of this post -withdrawal data .  For this, he/she needs to sign a 
corresponding declaration of objection ; alternatively, the patient ’s oral objection may be 
documented  in the patient ’s source data .

Supplement: Version 9 
Each patient  will have ample time and opportunity to ask questions . 
Only if the patient  agrees to sign the informed consent form and has done so, may he/she 
enter the study.  Additionally, the investigator will personally sign an d date the form.  The 
patient  will receive a copy of the signed and dated form.  
The signed informed consent statement is to remain in the investigator site file or, if locally 
required, in the patient’s note/file of the medical institution.  
In the event that informed consent is obtained on the date that baseline study procedures are 
performed, the study record or patient ´s clinical record must clearly show that informed 
consent was obtained prior to these procedures.  
For minors or adults under legal protection, consent shall be given by the legal guardian(s). 
The consent of a minor or adult under legal protection shall also be requested where such a

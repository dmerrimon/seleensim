HVTN122_v1.0_FINAL  / Page 4 of 109 1 Ethical considerations  
Multiple candidate HIV vaccines will need to be studied simultaneously in 
different populations around the world before a successful HIV preventive 
vaccine is found. It is critical th at universally accepted ethical guidelines are 
followed at all sites involved in the conduct of these clinical trials. The HIV 
Vaccine Trials Network (HVTN) has addressed ethical concerns in the following 
ways:  
 HVTN trials are designed and conducted to enh ance the knowledge base 
necessary to find a preventive vaccine, using methods that are scientifically 
rigorous and valid, and in accordance with Good Clinical Practice (GCP) 
guidelines.  
 HVTN scientists and operational staff incorporate the philosophies und erlying 
major codes [1-3], decl arations, and other guidance documents relevant to 
human subjects research into the design and conduct of HIV vaccine clinical 
trials.  
 HVTN scientists and operational staff are committed to substantive 
community input —into the planning, conduct, and follow -up of its research —
to help ensure that locally appropriate cultural and linguistic needs of study 
populations are met. Community Advisory Boards (CAB) are required by 
DAIDS and supported at all HVTN research sites to ensure community input.   
 HVTN clinical  trial staff counsel study participants routinely on how to 
reduce HIV risk. Participants who become HIV  infected during the trial are 
provided counseling on notifying their partners and about HIV infection 
according to local guidelines. Staff members will  also counsel them about 
reducing their risk of transmitting HIV to others.  
 Participants who become HIV  infected during the trial are referred to medical 
practitioners to manage their HIV infection and to identify potential clinical 
trials they may want to  join. 
 The HVTN provides training so that all participating sites similarly ensure fair 
participant selection, protect the privacy of research participants, and obtain 
meaningful informed consent. During the study, participants will have their 
wellbeing mo nitored, and to the fullest extent possible, their privacy 
protected. Participants may withdraw from the study at any time.  
 Prior to implementation, HVTN trials are rigorously reviewed by scientists 
who are not involved in the conduct of the trials under c onsideration.  
 HVTN trials are reviewed by local and national regulatory bodies and are 
conducted in compliance with all applicable national and local regulations.  
HVTN 122  Version 1.0  / September 27, 2017  
HVTN122_v1.0_FINAL  / Page 5 of 109  The HVTN designs its research to minimize risk and maximize benefit to both 
study participan ts and their local communities. For example, HVTN protocols 
provide enhancement of participants’ knowledge of HIV and HIV prevention, 
as well as counseling, guidance, and assistance with any social impacts that 
may result from research participation. HVTN protocols also include careful 
medical review of each research participant’s health conditions and reactions 
to study products while in the study.  
 HVTN research aims to benefit local communities by directly addressing the 
health and HIV prevention needs o f those communities and by strengthening 
the capacity of the communities through training, support, shared knowledge, 
and equipment. Researchers involved in HVTN trials are able to conduct other 
critical research in their local research settings.  
 The HVTN values the role of in -country Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) , 
Ethics Committees (ECs) , and other Regulatory Entities (REs)  as custodians 
responsible for ensuring the ethical conduct of research in each setting.  
HVTN 122  Version 1.0  / September 27, 2017  
HVTN122_v1.0_FINAL  / Page 6 of 109 2 IRB/EC review considerations  
US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and other US federal regulations 
require IRBs/ECs /REs  to ensure that certain requirements are satisfied on initial 
and continuing review of research (Title 45, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), 
Part 46.111(a) 1 -7; 21 CFR 56.111(a ) 1-7). The following section highlights how 
this protocol addresses each of these research requirements. Each HVTN 
Investigator welcomes IRB/EC /RE questions or concerns regarding these research 
requirements.  
2.1 Minimized risks to participants  
45 CFR 46.111 ( a) 1 and 21 CFR 56.111 (a) 1: Risks to subjects are 
minimized.  
This protocol minimizes risks to participants by (a) correctly and promptly 
informing participants about risks so that they can join in partnership with the 
researcher in recognizing and reporting harms; (b) respecting local/national blood 
draw limits; (c)  performing direct observation of participants postvaccination and 
collecting information regarding side effects for several days postvaccination; (d) 
having staff properly trained in administering study procedures that may cause 
physical harm or psycholog ical distress, such as blood draws, vaccinations, HIV 
testing and counseling and HIV risk reduction counseling; (e) providing HIV risk 
reduction counseling and checking on contraception use (for persons assigned 
female  at birth ); and (f) providing safety m onitoring.  
2.2 Reasonable risk/benefit balance  
45 CFR 46.111(a) 2 and 21 CFR 56.111(a) 2 : Risks to subjects are 
reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits, if any, to subjects, and 
the importance of the knowledge that may reasonably be expected to 
result.  
In all public health research, the risk -benefit ratio may be difficult to assess 
because the benefits to a healthy participant are not as apparent as they would be 
in treatment protocols, where a study participant may be ill and may have 
exhausted all conv entional treatment options. However, this protocol is designed 
to minimize the risks to participants while maximizing the potential value of the 
knowledge it is designed to generate.  
HVTN 122  Version 1.0  / September 27, 2017  
HVTN122_v1.0_FINAL  / Page 7 of 109 2.3 Equitable participant  selection  
45 CFR 46.111 (a) 3 and 21 CFR 56.111 ( a) 3: Subject selection is 
equitable  
This protocol has specific inclusion and exclusion criteria for investigators to 
follow in admitting participants into the protocol. Participants are selected 
because of these criteria and not because of positions of vu lnerability or privilege. 
Investigators are required to maintain screening and enrollment logs to document 
volunteers who screened into and out of the protocol and for what reasons.  
2.4 Appropriate informed consent  
45 CFR 46.111 (a) 4 & 5 and 21 CFR 56.111 (a)  4 & 5: Informed 
consent is sought from each prospective subject or the subject’s 
legally authorized representative as required by 45 CFR 46. 116 and 
21 CFR Part 50 ; informed consent is appropriately documented as 
required by 45 CFR 46. 117 and 21 CFR 50.27  
The protocol specifies that informed consent must be obtained before any study 
procedures are initiated and assessed throughout the trial (see Section 9.1). Each 
site is provided training in informed consent by the HVTN as part of its entering 
the HVTN. The HVTN requires a signed consent document for documentation, in 
addition to chart notes or a consent checklist.  
2.5 Adequate safety monitoring  
45 CFR 46 .111 (a) 6 and 21 CFR 56.111 (a) 6: There is adequate 
provision for monitoring the data collected to ensure the safety of 
subjects.  
This protocol has extensive safety monitoring in place (see Section 10). Safety is 
monitored daily by HVTN Core and routinely by the HVTN 122  Protocol Safety 
Review Team (PSRT). In addition, the HVTN Safety Monitoring Board (SMB) 
periodically reviews study data.  
2.6 Protect privacy/confidentiality  
45 CFR 46.111 (a) 7 and 21 CFR 56.111 (a) 7: There are adequate 
provisions to protect the privacy of subjects and maintain the 
confidentiality of data.  
Privacy refers to an individual’s right  to be free from unauthorized or 
unreasonable intrusion into his/her private life and the right to control access to 
individually identifiable information about him/her. The term “privacy” concerns 
research participants or potential research participants a s individuals whereas the 
HVTN 122  Version 1.0  / September 27, 2017  
HVTN122_v1.0_FINAL  / Page 8 of 109 term “confidentiality” is used to refer to the treatment of information about those 
individuals. This protocol respects the privacy of participants by informing them 
about who will have access to their personal information and stu dy data (see 
Appendix A ). The privacy of participants is protected by assigning unique 
identifiers in place of the participant’s name on study data and specimens. In the 
United States, research participants in HVTN protocols are pr otected by a 
Certificate of Confidentiality from the US NIH, which can prevent disclosure of 
study participation even when that information is requested by subpoena. 
Participants are told of the use and limits of the certificate in the study consent 
form.  In addition, each staff member at each study site in this protocol signs a n 
Agreement on  Confidentiality and Use of Data and Specimens with the HVTN 
and each study site participating in the protocol is required to have a standard 
operating procedure on how  the staff members will protect the confidentiality of 
study participants.

HVTN122_v1.0_FINAL  / Page 13 of 109 4 Background  
4.1 Vaccine product: gp145 C.6980 Env protein  
The gp145 C.6980 protein was derived from a clade C strain isolated from an 
acutely infected Tanzanian individual (CO6980.v0.c22)  [4]. A clade C founder 
virus was deemed advantageous as clade C infections represent more than half the 
HIV-1 pandemic and are prevalent in highly impacted regions, including southern 
and eastern Africa but also in other p arts of the world [5,6] . Relative to sera from 
persons infected with other clades of HIV -1, sera from clade C –infected 
individuals have been shown to be more broadly cross -reactive, neutralizing the 
greatest number of viruses in  multiclade neutralization panels [7-9]. Further, the 
use of a primary virus isolate obtained in acute infection may better represent the 
properties of transmitted/founder viruses, which a re the target of preventive 
vaccines [10,11] .  
gp145 C.6980  is a novel immunogen constructed by modifying th e gene for the 
CO6980.v0.c22 protein to terminate prior to the transmembrane region, thus 
retaining an intact membrane -proximal external region (MPER) without the 
carboxyl terminal cytoplasmic domain. Additional modifications to the gene were 
introduced to  prevent cleavage at the gp120/gp41 cleavage site and to facilitate 
trimer assembly and antigen presentation. gp145 C.6980 is produced as a secreted 
protein from Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and has been purified and tested 
in both in vitro  and in viv o assays. The gp145 C.6980 immunogen was developed 
by the United States Military HIV Research Program (MHRP); the lot used in this 
study was manufactured by Avid Biosciences (Tustin, CA, USA). The study 
product for this trial is supplied by DAIDS.  
The expr essed and purified gp145 C.6980  was shown to be assembled in multiple 
forms, with a significant fraction represented as Env trimers ( Figure 4-1A). 
Cryoelectron  microscopy of the gp145 trimers demonstrate the expected “fan-
blade”  morphology ( Figure 4-1B) [4].  
HVTN 122  Version 1.0  / September 27, 2017  
HVTN122_v1.0_FINAL  / Page 14 of 109  
Figure 4-1 A fraction of gp145 C.6980  is expressed as trimeric Env. (A)  Blue Native -PAGE 
analysis demonstrates that puri fied gp145 C.6980  exists in multiple  oligomeric forms, 
including trimers. (B)  The majority of the trimer fraction (lane 3) appears as true trimeric 
Envs with “fan-blade” morphology  by cryoelectron  microscopy  [4]. 
The primary virus CO6940.v0.c22 displays epitopes of and is neutralized by 
broadly neutralizing antibodies (bn Abs) targeting MPER (4E10), the CD4 binding 
site (VRC01) and V2 glycans (PG9/PG16, PGT121); the trimeric gp145 C.6980  
protein is sim ilarly bound by each of these bn Abs and additional mAbs targeting 
V2 (697, 2158, 2297) [4]. Immunization of rabbits with each structural fraction 
was tested. A ll fractions of the gp145 C.6980  were immunogenic, with induced 
antibodies showing binding to clade  C gp120 and gp140 Envs and cyclic V2

4.2 Rationale for trial concept  
The developmen t of a vaccine against HIV -1 infection remains a significant 
global health challenge. Based on the RV144 phase 3 HIV vaccine trial results, 
which provided the first clinical trial evidence that a vaccine combination could 
demonstrate modest efficacy in pre venting HIV infection [12,13] , an effective 
HIV vaccine is expected to require, as  1 component, an antigen that stimulates the 
production of an effective antibody response. This could consist of b nAbs that are 
capable of preventing HIV -1 entry into its target cells and blocking virus 
transmission [14,15]  and/or non -neutralizing antibodies with effector functions 
[16]. Such an antigen is likely to be an Env glycoprotein, since this is the only 
protein expressed on the surface of the HIV virus particl e that could serve as a 
target for vaccine -induced antibodies.  
Vaccine candidates tested to date in humans have not yet successfully generated 
strong bnAb responses against a wide spectrum of viruses. However, the RV144 
trial did demonstrate modest protect ion that was associated with antibody 
responses [17]. In RV144 , a 31% decrease in risk of HIV infection was observed 
in participants who received ALVAC canarypox vector expressing Env, Gag, and 
Pro at 0, 1, 3, and 6 m onths and were boosted with a monomeric gp120 protein, 
AIDSVAX B/E, at 3 and 6 months, compared to those who received placebo. 
Subsequent analyses of immune responses have demonstrated that antibodies to 
the V1V2 region of HIV Env were inversely correlated  with the risk of HIV -1 
infection in vaccine recipients [18-20]. 
While the Env protein in AIDSVAX was a gp120 monomer, several lines of 
evidence suggest that a trimeric Env antigen may better expose quaternary 
epitopes and lead to an improved protective immune response against HIV -1 
relative to monomeric protein [21-23]. In preclinical studies, the gp145 C.6980  
protein has been demonstrated to elicit neutralizing antibodies to certain viruses 
or pseudoviruses in rabbits [4] (Section 4.6).  
Hence, the goal of this trial is to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of 2 dose 
levels of gp145 C.6980, a novel oligomeric  Env antigen, in healthy, HIV -1–
uninfected adult participants in the US and, if it is  demonstrated to be safe and 
immunogenic, to qualify it for further clinical testing, most likely as  1 component 
in a combination vaccine prime -boost strategy.  
4.3 Rationale for t rial design  
4.3.1  Dose (amount and number)  
This study will test  2 doses: 300 mcg gp145  C.6980  with alum (n  = 25) and 100 
mcg gp145 C.6980  with alum (n  = 15) compared to placebo (n  = 5). The 300 mcg 
HVTN 122  Version 1.0  / September 27, 2017  
HVTN122_v1.0_FINAL  / Page 16 of 109 dose is based on dosing of Env proteins used in RV144 [12]; the 100 mcg dose is 
being tested to explore immunogenicity of a lower dose  regimen. The  2 doses are 
projected to be used in combination vaccine trials that may occur subsequently.  
4.3.2  Schedule  
All groups will receive the vaccine or placebo at Months 0, 2, and 6.  
Enrollment will proceed in all groups  simultaneously and will be rest ricted to a 
maximum of 1 participant per group per day until the initial 20%, or 9 participants 
(5 in Group 1, 3 in Group 2, and 1 in Group 3) have been enrolled and observed 
for 2 weeks. The PSRT will review safety data reported for the first 2 weeks 
following the first vaccination for each of these participants and will determine 
whether it is safe to proceed with full enrollment.  
4.3.3  Choice of control  
Placebo will be Sodium Chloride for Injection, 0.9%  delivered as a 1 mL 
injection.  
4.4 Plans for future product development and testing  
This trial is a phase 1 double -blind, placebo -controlled randomized clinical trial to 
evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of a recombinant gp145 clade C Env 
protein in healthy, HIV -1–uninfected adult participants in the US. If th e trial 
demonstrates that gp145 C.6980  is safe, tolerable, and immunogenic, it will be 
considered as an Env immunogen in subsequent combination vaccine trials. In 
particular, the developers of gp145 C.6980  have been in discussion with 
representatives from the China Centers for Disease Control regarding the prospect 
of evaluating this protein as a boost component in a regimen that includes a DNA 
prime and a recombinant Tiantan strain vaccinia vector boost [24,25] . 
4.5 Preclinical safety studies  
gp145 C.6980  has not previously been tested in humans. The immunogenicity 
studies performed to date with the gp145 C.6980 , as well as its physiochemical 
characterization, suggest that the protein retains the intended conformation 
predicted to be immunogenic and is not associated with any unexpected properties 
that would raise po tential safety concerns. The safety of other HIV Env proteins 
administered with alum has been extensively studied in clinical trials and 
preclinical studies. The extensive clinical experience with these HIV Envs as 
vaccine antigens is described briefly bel ow (Section 4.6.3 ).

4.6.1  Immunogenicity of gp145 C.6980  in rabbits , study #1  
The gp145 C.6980  protein has been evaluated in 2 rabbit studies testing the ability 
of the vaccine to stimulate a neutralizing antibody response  (Table 4-1). Study 1 
tested the ability of unfractionated  gp145 C.6980  to stimulate binding and 
neutralizing antibody responses in rabbits. Unfractionated gp145 C.6980  with 
alum was tested against unfractionated gp145 C.6980  and liposomal adjuvants 
that were prepared to encapsulate ( Groups 3 and 4) or mix with ( Group 2 ) the test 
article. Animals were immunized at weeks 0, 4, and 8 via IM injection. Blood was 
collected at Weeks -2, 0, 4, 8, 10, and 12.  
4.6.1.1  Binding antibody responses  
Sera were collected 2 weeks after the last vaccination ( Week 10) and tested for 
binding activ ity to homologous and heterologous Envs. Weak titers were seen in 
some animals to gp41 proteins, whereas there was a positive response against 
each of the clade  C gp120 and gp140 proteins ( Figure 4-3).

responses were similar for unfractionated  gp145 C.6980  and fractio nated gp145 C.6980  
(dimers, trimers, higher order oligomers) in Study 2  (D) [4]. 
4.6.1.2  Neutralizing antibody responses  
Elicitation of neutralizing antibody res ponses was tested using the TZM -bl assa y 
[26,27]  and PBMC assay [28,29] . The TZM -bl assay provides a well -validated, 
high-throughput assessment of plasma inhibition of entry into a laboratory cell 
line. The PBMC neutralization provides a dose -response measure of plasma 
antibody inhibition of infectious molecular clones expressing luciferas e reporters 
in a 72 hour culture of stimulated primary blood mononuclear cells.  In the TZM -
bl assay,  sera from vaccinated rabbits neutralized 3 of 6 viruses, reflecting a 
predominantly Tier 1 (easy to neutralize) response. There was no neutralizing 
activity against the homologous CO6980 pseudovirus (Tier 2) or heterologous 
Tier 2 CRF01_AE viruses ( Figure 4-4 A, C). In the PBMC as say, neutralization 
was seen against 5 tested viruses, including the homologous CO6980 strain 
(Figure 4-4 B, D).  
4.6.2  Immunogenicity of gp145 C.6980  in rabbits , study #2: fractionated 
protein  
In Study 2, rabbits were immunized with either unfractionated gp145 C.6980  or 
preparations  enriched for dimers, trimers, or other higher order fractions based on 
size-exclusion chromatography (see  Figure 4-1A). Se ra were tested for binding 
and neutralizing antibody responses.  

HVTN 122  Version 1.0  / September 27, 2017  
HVTN122_v1.0_FINAL  / Page 19 of 109 4.6.2.1  Binding antibody responses  
Sera were collected 2 weeks after the last vaccination (week 10) and tested for 
binding activity to homologous and heterologous Envs ( clade  C gp120, subtype C 
gp140,  and cyclic V2 peptides of the homologous CO6980.v0.c22 strain ). 
Responses in sera from animals vaccinated with unfractionated gp145 C.6980  
were similar  to the responses seen in Study 1. Sera from animals vaccinated with 
purified fractions displayed  simila r profiles as the unfractionated animals in Study 
1 and 2.  
4.6.2.2  Neutralizing antibody responses  
As in Study 1, elicitation of neutralizing antibody responses was tested in the 
TZM -bl assay and PBMC assay. Sera from vaccinated rabbits were tested against 
the 3 heterologous pseudoviruses that were neutralized in Study 1 and the 
homologous C.6980 pseudovirus. Neutralization activity was seen for the 3 
heterologous Tier 1 viruses and was not different between the unfractionated and 
purified proteins. As in Study 1, neutralizing activity was seen against all 4 
viruses in the PBMC assay. Thus, unfractionated and each oligomeric formulation 
elicited Tier 1  neutralizing antibody  responses.  
 
Figure 4-4 Fractionated and unfractionated gp145 C.6980  induce heterologous Tier 1 
neutralizing antibody responses. Neutralizing ant ibody responses detected by TZM -bl (A 
and C) and PBMC assays (B and D). In Study 1, neutralization in TZM-bl assay is seen 
against Tier 1 viruses only in the TZM-bl assay (A) and more widely in the PBMC assay (B). 
In Study 2, similar titers are seen with fractionated and unfractionated gp145 C.6 980 against 
Tier 1 viruses (C and D).  
4.6.3  Preclinical study of gp145 C.6980 in non -human primates  
gp145 C.6980  was administered to 16 Indian -origin rhesus macaques three times 
over a period of nine months in conjunction with recombinant live attenuated 
modifie d vaccinia Ankara (MVA) vector encoding HIV -1 GagPol/Env derived 
from subtypes A, C, and E .  Animals received MVA at month 0, followed by 

HVTN 122  Version 1.0  / September 27, 2017  
HVTN122_v1.0_FINAL  / Page 20 of 109 concurrent MVA and gp145 at months 3, 6, and 12. gp145 C.6980  immunizations 
consisted of 100 mcg of protein adjuvanted  with aluminum hydroxide 
(Alhydrogel, Brenntag ) delivered IM. The protein was safely administered and 
well-tolerated with no adverse events. Animal body weights and temperatures 
remained stable following each immunization.gp145 C.6980  was immunogenic in 
all animals, eliciting binding antibody responses with a median titer of 105 to 
gp140 (subtype C CN54) and 103.7 to cyclic V2 peptide (gp145). Tier 1 
neutralizing antibodies were also consistently observed, showing a median ID50-1 
of 103 to both MW965 and TH 023 (subtype C and E, respectively). gp120 -
specific CD4+ T cells were observed in most animals, ranging from 0.1 -0.5% of 
the memory compartment, while CD8+ T -cell responses were observed in only a 
subset of animals at 0.6 -3% of memory cells. In sum, gp145 C.6980  showed 
consistent and robust immunogenicity with no safety concerns in nonhuman 
primates.  
4.7 Clinical studies  
Though gp145 C.6980  has not previously been evaluated in humans, the safety of 
other HIV Env proteins administered with alum has been extensively studied in 
clinical and preclinical studies. T he extensive clinical experience with these HIV 
Envs as vaccine antigens is describ ed briefly here.  
Multiple monomeric Env proteins (gp120, gp140, gp145, gp160) have been 
administered in many clinical trials as the sole vaccine component or as a part of a 
prime boost regimen. The majority of proteins were produced in CHO cells (as is 
gp145 C.6980 ). Overall, vaccines consisting of or expressing HIV Env variants 
were well tolerated. The long -term safety data from NIAID -sponsored clinical 
trials conducted between 1987 and 2001 was analyzed by Gilbert and colleagues 
[30]. This report included 51 phase 1 and 2 trials, including data on 3189 
uninfected participants; the majority of stu dies included an Env protein as an 
immunogen [30]. The published analysis concluded that  1 vaccine containing a 
C4-V3 polypeptide vaccine emulsified in incomplete Freund’s adjuvant caused 
serious toxicity, but otherwise no serious safety problems were identified for any 
of the vaccines or adjuvants studied.  
The largest clinical safety dataset for Env proteins is from the VAX003, VAX004, 
and RV144 studies, in which more than 12,000 participants received either 
AIDSVAX B/E or AIDSVAX B/B (each a mixture of 2 CHO -derived gp120 
proteins totaling 600mcg [300mcg of each protein] in alum adjuvant). Safety  data 
showed that these vaccines appeared safe and well tolerated [31]. In the RV144 
trial, the frequency of reactions in AIDSVAX B/E recipients was 54.6% vs. 
46.3% in placebo recipients. Pain and tenderness were the most frequent local 
reactions  observed, and all reactions were generally mild and resolved within 3 
days. Systemic reactogenicity was also observed more frequently in the combined 
vaccine group (77.2%) than the placebo group (59.8%). Systemic reactions 
following the third and fourth v accination could not be attributed to a specific 
vaccine (ie, AIDSVAX or ALVAC) . 
HVTN 122  Version 1.0  / September 27, 2017  
HVTN122_v1.0_FINAL  / Page 21 of 109 Recent clinical experience with other oligomeric Env antigens is also available 
from a smaller number of studies. Oligomeric forms of gp140 clade  C and clade  B 
Env proteins ma nufactured by Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics have been 
evaluated in 3 IND studies ( clade  C gp140 strain TV1 with MF59 and clade B 
gp140 strain SF162 with MF59) [32,33] . An oligomeric gp160 Env protein was 
administered to 45 participants in RV132, a phase 1 -2 prime -boost study in 
Thailand [34]. More than 100 participants received the oligomeric subtype C 
product in a recent HVTN study (HVTN 086) [35]. The safe ty profile of these 
products was similar to that observed for the AIDSVAX products. The vaccines 
were generally well tolerated without vaccine -related serious adverse events.

HVTN 122  Version 1.0  / September 27, 2017  
HVTN122_v1.0_FINAL  / Page 25 of 109 6 Statistical considerations  
6.1 Accrual and sample size calculations  
Recruitment will target enrolling 45 healthy, HIV-uninfected adult participants  
aged 18 to 50 years, at low risk for HIV infection: 40 vaccine and 5 placebo 
recipients. Each participant will be randomly assigned to receive 1 of 2 doses of 
the vaccine regimen or placebo  in a 5:3:1 ratio with 25, 15, an d 5 participants in 
the 300 mcg dose (Group 1), 100 mcg dose (Group 2) and placebo (Group 3) 
arms, respectively. Since the 300 mcg dose level will be considered in future 
China CDC/NIAID/HVTN collaborative trials, the sample size of Group 1 
accounts for th e minimal sample size requirement (≥  20) by China FDA to 
generate safety data for exporting the vaccine to China. The placebo arm provides 
a control group for assay quality assurance and blinding.  
To ensure that both men and women will be adequately represented in the trial, 
the trial will enroll at least approximately 40% of each sex assigned at birth 
overall. Hence, when approximately 18 participants of  1 sex are enrolled, sites 
will be notified to stop further  recruitment of persons of that sex  assigned at birth . 
Since enrollment is concurrent with receiving the first study vaccination, all 
participants will provide some safety data. However, for immunogenicity 
analyses, it is possible that data may be missing for various reasons, such as 
participants terminating from the study early, problems in shipping specimens, 
low cell viability of processed PBMCs, or high assay background levels. 
Immunogenicity data from 17 phase 1 and 2 phase 2a HVTN vacci ne trials, which 
began enrolling after June 2005 (data as of September 2014), indicate that 10% is 
a reasonable estimate for the rate of missing data at days 14 and 182. For this 
reason, the sample size calculations in Section 6.1.2  account for 4 enrolled 
participants having missing data for the primary immunogenicity endpoint.  
6.1.1  Sample size calculations for safety  
The goal of the safety evaluation for this study is to  identify safety concerns 
associated with product administration. The ability of the study to detect SAEs  
can be expressed by the true event rate above which at least 1 SAE would likely 
be observed and the true event rate below which no events would likely  be 
observed. Specifically, for each vaccine arm of the study (n =  15, 25 ), there is a 
90% chance of observing at least 1 event if the true rate of such an event is 14.3% 
or 8.9% or more , respectively ; and there is a 90% chance of observing no events 
if the true rate is 0.4% or  0.7%  less, respectively. For vaccine arms  combined (n =  
40), there is a 90% chance of observing at least 1 event if the true rate of such an 
event is 5.6% or more; and there is a 90% chance of observing no events if the 
true rate is 0.26% or less. As a reference, in previous AVEG HIV vaccine trials, 
3.5% of control participants experienced an SAE; in HVTN vaccine trials from 
December 2000 through April 2014 , about 4% of participants who received

HVTN122_v1.0_FINAL  / Page 26 of 109 Probabili ties of observing 0 and 2 or more events among 15, 25 , or 40 vaccine 
recipients are presented in Table 6-1 below for a range of possible true AE rates. 
These calculat ions provide a complete picture of the sensitivity of this study 
design to identify potential safety problems with the vaccine. For example, we see 
that if the true rate of AEs is 1%, there is a n 86%, 78%, or 67% chance that no 
events will be observed in t he vaccine arm of 15, 25, or 40 participants, 
respectively.

n=15, 25 or 4 0 vaccine recipients , for different true event rates

An alternative way of describing the statistical properties of the study design is in 
terms of the 95% confidence interval  (CI) for the true rate of an AE based on the 
observed data. Table 6-2 shows the 2 -sided 95% CIs for the probability of an 
event based on a particular observed rate. Calcul ations are done using the score 
test metho d [36]. If none of the 15, 25 or 40 vaccine recipients experience a safety 
event, the 95% 2 -sided upper confidence bound for the true rate of such events is  
21.8%, 13.7% or  8.81%, respectively .

6.1.2  Sample size calculations for immunogenicity  
The main goals of this trial regarding immunogenicity outcomes involve a 
preliminary estimation of response rates based on data from the BAMA , ICS, and 
nAb assays among vaccinees  at 2 weeks following vaccination . No adjustment for 
multiple comparisons will be made for the use of multiple assays. The precision 
with which the true response rate can be estimated from the observed data 
depends on the true underlying response rate and the sample size. Two -sided 95%

6.2 Randomization  
The randomization sequence will be obtained by computer -generated random 
numbers and provided to each HVTN CRS through a Web -based randomization 
system. The randomization will be done in blocks to ensure balance across arms. 
At each institution, the pharmacist with primary responsibility for dispensing 
study products is charged with maintaining security of the treatment ass ignments  
(except in emergency situations as specified in the HVTN Manual of Operations 
(MOP).  
6.3 Blinding  
Participants and site staff (except for site pharmacists) will be blinded as to 
participant treatment arm assignments (eg, vaccine or control). Study pro duct 
assignments are accessible to those HVTN CRS pharmacists, DAIDS protocol 
pharmacists and contract monitors, and SDMC staff who are required to know 
HVTN 122  Versio n 1.0  / September 27, 2017  
HVTN122_v1.0_FINAL  / Page 28 of 109 this information in order to ensure proper trial conduct. Any discussion of study 
product assignment be tween pharmacy staff and any other HVTN CRS staff is 
prohibited. The HVTN SMB members also are unblinded to treatment assignment 
in order to conduct review of trial safety.  
When a participant leaves the trial prior to study completion, the participant wil l 
be told he or she must wait until all participants are unblinded to learn his or her 
treatment assignment.  
Emergency unblinding decisions will be made by the site investigator. If time 
permits, the HVTN 122  PSRT should be  consulted before emergency unblinding 
occurs.  See the HVTN MOP for more information.  
6.4 Statistical analys es 
This section describes the final study analys es, unblinded as to treatment arm 
assignment. All data from enrolled participants will be analyzed accor ding to the 
initial randomization assignment regardless of how many vaccinations they 
received. In the rare instance that a participant receives the wrong treatment at a 
specific vaccination time, the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) will address how to 
analyze the participant’s safety data. A nalys es are modified intent -to-treat in that 
individuals who are randomized but not enrolled do not contribute data and hence 
are excluded. Because of blinding and the brief length of time between 
randomization and enrollment —typically no more than 4 working days —very 
few such individuals are expected.  
Analyses for primary endpoints will be performed using SAS and R. All other 
descriptive and inferential statistical analyses will be performed using SAS, 
StatXact, or R statistical software.  
No formal multiple compariso n adjustments will be employed for multiple safety 
endpoints, multiple primary immunogenicity endpoints, or secondary endpoints. 
However, multiplicity adjustments will be made for certain immunogenicity 
assays, as discussed below, when the assay endpoint i s viewed as a collection of 
hypotheses (eg, testing multiple peptide pools to determine a positive response).  
6.4.1  Analysis variables  
The analysis variables consist of baseline participant characteristic s, safety, and 
immunogenicity for primary - and secondary -objective analyses.  
6.4.2  Baseline comparability  
Treatment arms will be compared for baseline participant characteristics using 
descriptive statistics.  
HVTN 122  Version 1.0  / September 27, 2017  
HVTN122_v1.0_FINAL  / Page 29 of 109 6.4.3  Safety/tolerability analysis  
Since enrollment is concurrent with receiving the first vaccination, all participa nts 
will have received at least 1 vaccination and therefore will provide some safety 
data.  
6.4.3.1  Reactogenicity  
The number and percentage of participants experiencing each type of 
reactogenicity sign or symptom will be tabulated by severity and treatment arm 
and the percentages displayed graphically by arm. For a given sign or symptom, 
each participant’s reactogenicity will be counted once under the maximum 
severity for all injection visits. In addition to the individual types of events, the 
maximum severity of l ocal pain or tenderness, induration or erythema, and of 
systemic symptoms will be calculated. Kruskal -Wallis tests will be used to test for 
differences in severity between arms.  
6.4.3.2  AEs and SAEs  
AEs will be summarized using MedDRA System Organ Class and preferred 
terms. Tables will show by treatment arm the number and percentage of 
participants experiencing an AE within a System Organ Class or within preferred 
term category by severity or by relationship to study product. For the calculations 
in these tab les, a participant with multiple AEs within a category will be counted 
once under the maximum severity or the strongest recorded causal relationship to 
study product. Formal statistical testing comparing arms is not planned since 
interpretation of differen ces must rely heavily upon clinical judgment.  
A listing of SAEs reported to the DAIDS Regulatory Support Center (RSC) 
Safety Office will provide details of the events including severity, relationship to 
study product, time between onset and last vaccinatio n, and number of 
vaccinations received.  
6.4.3.3  Local laboratory values   
Box plot s of local laboratory values will be generated for baseline values and for 
values measured during the course of the study by treatment arm and visit. Each 
box plot  will show the firs t quartile, the median, and the third quartile. Outliers 
(values outside the box plot ) will also be plotted. If appropriate, horizontal lines 
representing boundaries for abnormal values will be plotted.  
For each local laboratory measure, summary statistics  will be presented by 
treatment arm and timepoint , as well as changes from baseline for postenrollment 
values. In addition, the number (percentage) of participants with local laboratory 
values recorded as meeting Grade 1 AE criteria or above as specified i n the 
Division of AIDS Table for Grading the Severity of Adul t and Pediatric Adverse 
Events  (section  9.8) will be tabulated by treatment arm for each postvaccinatio n 
timepoint . Reportable clinical laboratory abnormalities without an associated 
clinical diagnosis will also be included in the tabulation of AEs described above.  
HVTN 122  Version 1.0  / September 27, 2017  
HVTN122_v1.0_FINAL  / Page 30 of 109 6.4.3.4  Reasons for vaccination discontinuation and early study termination  
The number and percentage  of participants who discontinue vaccination and who 
terminate the study early will be tabulated by reason and treatment arm.  
6.4.4  Immunogenicity analysis  
6.4.4.1  General approach  
For the statistical analysis of immunogenicity endpoints, data from enrolled 
participants  will be used according to the initial randomization assignment 
regardless of how many injections they received. Additional analyses may be 
performed, limited to participants who received all scheduled injections per 
protocol. Assay results that are unreli able, from specimens collected outside of 
the visit window, or from HIV -infected participants postinfection are excluded. 
Since the exact date of HIV infection is unknown, any assay data from blood 
draws 4 weeks prior to an infected participant’s last sero negative sample and 
thereafter may be excluded. If an HIV -infected participant does not have a 
seronegative sample postenrollment, then all data from that participant may be 
excluded from the analysis.  
Discrete categorical assay endpoints ( eg, response rat es) will be analyzed by 
tabulating the frequency of positive response for each assay by antigen and 
treatment arm at each timepoint for which an assessment is performed. Crude 
response rates will be presented with their corresponding 95% confidence interva l 
estimates calculated using the score test method [36]. Because of the small 
numbers of control participants, no adjustment will be made to the vaccine arm 
estimates for the false positive rates in the control arms. Barnard or Fisher’s exact 
tests, as specified in the SAP, will be used to compare the response rates of the 2 
vaccine arms, with a significant difference declared if the 2 -sided p -value is ≤ 
0.05.  In general Barnard’s is preferred since under most circumstances it is more 
powerful t han Fisher’s [37].  
For quantitative assay data  (eg, IgG binding Ab response from the multiplex assay 
or CD4+/CD8+ T cell response from the ICS assay) , graphical and tabular 
summaries of the distributions by antigen, treatment arm, and timepoint will be 
made. For all primary and secondary immunogenicity endpoints, box plots and 
plots of estimated reverse cumulative distribution curves will be used for 
graphical display of all of the study arms. Typically the results will be shown for 
each vaccine arm and for the control arm separately.   
The difference between a rms at a specific timepoint may  be tested with a 
nonparametric Wilcoxon rank sum test if the da ta are not normally distributed and 
with a 2 -sample t -test if the data appear to be normally distributed. An appropriate 
data transformation (eg, log 10 transformation) may be applied to better satisfy 
assumptions of symmetry and homoscedasticity (constant variance).   
HVTN 1 22 Version 1.0  / September 27, 2017  
HVTN122_v1.0_FINAL  / Page 31 of 109 6.4.4.2  Multivariate display of immunogenicity endpoints  
Data visualization techniques may be used to explore the relationship among 
immunogenicity readouts. The  set of readouts may be based on  1 of the primary 
endpoints (eg, ICS), on the set of primar y endpoints, or on immunogenicity 
endpoints that also include secondary or exploratory endpoints. To understand the 
relationship between pairs of readouts, scatter plots may be used when the number 
of readouts is small or for a larger number of readouts, a  heat map  showing the 
degree of correlation between any  2 pairs. Principal component analysis (PCA) 
and associated “biplot s” of the scores and loadings are particularly useful to 
understand associations between readouts, especially when readouts are correl ated 
[38]. PCA is a method to reduce the dimensionality of the number of readouts to a 
smaller set of values (principal components) that are normalized linear 
combinations of the readou ts in such a way that the first principal component 
accounts for the most variability in the data and subsequent components, while 
maximizing variability, are uncorrelated with each other. A ‘biplot’ displays the 
first and second principal component scores  and principal component loadings. 
The x -axis is the value from the first principal component and the y -axis is the 
second principal component, where each axis label includes the percentage of 
variation in the total set of readouts captured by the principa l component. The top 
axis is the first principal component loadings and the right axis is the second 
principal component loadings. An arrow is drawn for each immunogenicity 
readout (eg, Env -specific CD4+ T cell polyfunctionality score, Env -specific 
CD8+ T cell total magnitude) from the origin to the point defined by its first  2 
principal component loadings. The length of the arrow represents the amount of 
total variation of the set of readouts captured by the given readout. The direction 
of an arrow conveys  the extent to which the variation of a readout is in the 
direction of the first or second principal component. The angle between  2 arrows 
conveys information about the correlation of the  2 readouts, with a  0 degree angle 
denoting perfect correlation and a  90 degree angle denoting no correlation. Each 
arrow on the biplot is labeled by the immunogenicity readout it represents. A 
biplot is annotated with key meta -information such as the treatment arm (most 
common application) or a demographic category. Depend ing on the application, 
K-means clustering and hierarchical clustering may also be applied for 
multivariate graphical display of immunogenicity readouts.  
6.4.4.3  Secondary  analys is of binding antibody data as measured by the BAMA 
assay  
When a small panel of antige ns (eg, ≤ 5) is being assessed in a multiplexed 
immunoassay, the response magnitudes and rates at 2 weeks following the first 
and third vaccinations will be evaluated for each antigen. When a larger panel is 
being assessed, in addition to assessing each an tigen separately, a summary 
measure across a group of similar antigens will be calculated, for example, a 
weighted -average may be constructed to account for the correlations between 
antigens as an integrate d magnitude of responses to multiple antigens. The n this 
summary measure may be used as the outcome variable to assess if this overall 
response measure differs by arms.  
HVTN 122  Version 1.0  / September 27, 2017  
HVTN122_v1.0_FINAL  / Page 32 of 109 6.4.4.4  Secondary a nalysis of CD4+ and CD8+ T -cell response as measured by 
the ICS assay  
The analysis of CD4+ and CD8+ T -cell response rates as measured by the ICS 
assay will be evaluated and compared as described under the general approach. 
For each T -cell subset, the positivity call for each peptide pool  will include  a 
multiple comparison ad justment for the number of peptide pools used in the 
assay.  In general, the Mixture Models for Single -cell Assay s (MIMOSA) 
statistical framework [39] and/or the Fisher’s exact test -based positivity criteria 
will be used. Details of the positivity criteria will b e discussed in the SAP. The 
magnitude of marginal response will be analyzed as described for quantitative  
data in the general approach section. For each T -cell subset, graphs will be used to 
display the background -subtracted magnitudes for each participant  by protein, 
treatment arm, and timepoint. When 3 or more cytokines are being measured by 
the ICS assay, the polyfunctionality of ICS responses may also be analyzed as an 
exploratory endpoint. Besides descriptive plots of the magnitude of polyfunctional 
responses, the Combinatorial Polyfunctionality analysis of Antigen -Specific T -
cell Subsets  () statistical framework [40] may also be used to perform joint 
modelling of multiple T -cell sub sets of different cytokine combinations. For 
example, the functionality score (FS) and the polyfunctionality score (PFS) may 
be used to summarize the multi -parameter ICS responses.  
6.4.5  Analyses prior to end of scheduled follow -up visits  
Any analyses conducted  prior to the end of the scheduled follow -up visits should 
not compromise the integrity of the trial in terms of participant retention or safety 
or immunogenicity endpoint assessments. In particular, early unblinded analyses 
by treatment assignment require  careful consideration and should be made 
available on a need to know basis only.  
6.4.5.1  Safety  
During the course of the trial, unblinded analyses of safety data will be prepared 
approximately every 4 months for review  by the SMB. Ad hoc safety reports may 
also b e prepared for SMB review at the request of the HVTN 122  PSRT. The 
HVTN leadership must approve any other requests for unblinded safety data prior 
to the end of the scheduled follow -up visits.  
6.4.5.2  Immunogenicity  
An unblinded sta tistical analysis by treatment assignment of a primary 
immunogenicity endpoint may be performed when all participants have 
completed the corresponding primary immunogenicity visit and data are available 
for analysis from at least 80% of these participants.  Similarly, an unblinded 
statistical analysis by treatment assignment of a secondary or exploratory 
immunogenicity endpoint may be performed when all participants have 
completed the corresponding immunogenicity visit and data are available for 
analysis fro m at least 80% of these participants. However, such analyses for a 
secondary or exploratory immunogenicity endpoint will only take place after at 
HVTN 122  Version 1.0  / September 27, 2017  
HVTN122_v1.0_FINAL  / Page 33 of 109 least 1 of the primary immunogenicity endpoi nts of the same class (humoral or 
cell-mediated) or, if no primary  endpoint of the same class, at least  1 of the 
primary immunogenicity endpoints reaches the aforementioned threshold . The 
Laboratory Program will review the analysis report prior to distribution to the 
protocol chairs, DAIDS, vaccine developer, and other k ey HVTN members and 
investigators. Distribution of reports will be limited to those with a need to know 
for the purpose of informing future trial -related decisions. The HVTN leadership 
must approve any other requests for HVTN immunogenicity analyses prior to the 
end of the scheduled follow -up visits .

7.3 Participant departure from vaccination schedule or withdrawal  
This section concerns an individual participant’s departure from the vaccination 
schedule. Pause rules for the trial as a whole are described in Section  11.4. 
7.3.1  Delaying v accinations for a participant  
Under certain circumstances, a participant’s scheduled vaccination will be 
delayed. The factors to be considered in such a decision include but are not 
limited to the following:  
 Within 45 days prior to any study injection   
 Receipt of b lood products or immunoglobulin  
 Within 30  days prior to any study injection  
 Receipt of l ive attenuated vaccines other than influenza vaccine  
 Receipt of a llergy treatment with antigen injections  
 Within 14 days prior to any study injection  
 Receipt of influenza vaccine or any vaccines that are not live attenuated 
vaccines (eg, pneumococcal)  
 Pre-vaccination abnormal vital signs or clinical symptoms that may mask 
assessment of vaccine reaction.  
Vaccinations should not be administered outside the visit  window period specified 
in the HVTN 122  Study Specific Procedures.  
In order to avoid vaccination delays and missed vaccinations, participants who 
plan to receive licensed vaccines  or allergy treatments should be counseled to 
schedule receipt of these substances, when possible, outside the intervals 
indicated above. The effects of these substances on safety and immunogenicity 
assessments and their interactions with study vaccines are unknown. Therefore, if 
circumstances allo w, these substances should also be avoided in the 2 week  
interval between a study vaccination and completion of the 2 week  
postvaccination follow -up visit.  
7.3.2  Participant departure from vaccination schedule  
Every effort should be made to follow the vaccination schedule per the protocol. 
If a participant misses a vaccination and the visit window period for the 
vaccination has passed, that vaccination cannot be given. The participant should 
be asked to continue  study visits. The participant should resume the vaccination 
HVTN 122  Version 1.0  / September 27, 2017  
HVTN122_v1.0_FINAL  / Page 41 of 109 schedule with the next vaccination unless there are circumstances that require 
further delay or permanent discontinuation of vaccination (see Sections 7.3.1  and 
7.3.3 ).  
7.3.3  Discontinuing vaccination for a participant  
Under certain circum stances, an individual participant’s vaccinations will be 
permanently discontinued. Specific events that will result in stopping a 
participant’s vaccination schedule include:  
 Co-enrollment in a study with an investigational research agent (rare 
exceptions allowing for the continuation of vaccinations may be granted with 
the unanimous consent of the HVTN 122  PSRT).  
 Clinically significant condition (ie, a condition that affects the immune system 
or for which continued vaccinati ons and/or blood draws may pose additional 
risk), including but not limited to the following:  
 Pregnancy (regardless of outcome)  
 Any grade 4 local or systemic reactogenicity symptom, lab abnormality, or 
AE that is subsequently considered to be related to va ccination  
 Any grade 3 lab abnormality or other clinical AE (exception: fever or 
vomiting and subjective local and systemic symptoms) that is 
subsequently considered to be related to vaccination ; upon review, the 
HVTN 122 PSRT may allow continuation of vacc ination if a participant 
had grade 3 erythema and/or induration  
 SAE that is subsequently considered to be related to vaccination  
 Clinically significant type 1 hypersensitivity reaction associated with 
study vaccination. Consultation with the HVTN 122  PSRT is required 
prior to subsequent vaccinations following any type 1 hypersensitivity 
reaction associated with study vaccination  
 Investigator determination in consultation with Protocol Team leadership (eg, 
for repeated nonadhe rence to study staff instructions).  
Such participants should be counseled on the importance of continuing with the 
study and strongly encouraged to participate in follow -up visits and protocol -
related procedures per the protocol for the remainder of the tr ial, unless medically 
contraindicated.  
In addition, vaccinations will be stopped for participants diagnosed with HIV 
infection. HIV -infected participants will not continue in the trial (see Sections 
7.3.4  and 9.5.1 ). 
HVTN 122  Version 1.0  / September 27, 2017  
HVTN122_v1.0_FINAL  / Page 42 of 109 7.3.4  Participant termination from the study  
Under certain circumstances, an individual participant may be terminated  from 
participation in this study. Specific events that will result in early termination 
include:  
 Participant refuses further participation,  
 Participant relocates and remote follow -up or transfer to another HVTN CRS 
is not possible,  
 HVTN CRS determines tha t the participant is lost to follow -up,  
 Participant becomes HIV infected,  
 Investigator decides, in consultation with Protocol Team leadership, to 
terminate participation (eg, if participant exhibits inappropriate behavior 
toward clinic staff) , or 
 Any condition where termination from the study is required by applicable  
regulations.

(Group 3)  
Using aseptic technique, the pharmacist will withdraw 1 mL of Sodium Chloride 
for Injection, 0.9 % into a 2, 3, or 5 mL size syringe. The pharmacist will apply an 
overlay to the syringe.  
The syringe should be labeled as “HVTN 122 study product”.  The syringe must 
also be labeled for administration in the deltoid and “Gently roll the syringe prior 
to ad ministration”. In order to maintain the blind, the study product should be 
administered as soon as possible after preparation.  
Any unused portion of vials or expired prefilled syringes is disposed of in 
accordance with institutional or pharmacy policy.  
HVTN 122  Version 1.0  / September 27, 2017  
HVTN122_v1.0_FINAL  / Page 46 of 109 8.4 Adm inistration  
All injections are to be given IM in the deltoid.  
When preparing a dose in a syringe and administering the dose, consideration 
should be given to the volume of solution in the needle before and after the dose 
is administered. Particularly, if the needle used to withdraw the product is 
replaced prior to vaccine administration, consideration should be given to 
conserving the full dose of product. The pharmacy and clinic staff members are 
encouraged to work together to administer the dose specifie d in the protocol.  
The person administering the injection should gently roll the syringe prior to 
administration of the study product. These syringes will be labeled as “HVTN 122 
study product”.  
Any administrator of study product will be blinded to the ind ividual participant’s 
treatment assignment. At sites where registered pharmacists are legally authorized 
to administer injections, the HVTN CRS may choose to have a blinded 
pharmacist administer vaccinations.  
8.5 Acquisition of study products  
gp145 C.6980 will  be provided by the Division of AIDS, NIAID, NIH.  
Aluminum Hydroxide Suspension will be provided by the Vaccine Research 
Center, NIAID, NIH.  
Sodium Chloride for Injection, 0.9% will not be provided through the protocol 
and must be obtained by the site.  
Once an HVTN CRS is protocol registered, the pharmacist can obtain study 
products from the NIAID Clinical Research Products Management Center 
(CRPMC) by following the ordering procedures given in Pharmacy Guidelines 
and Instructions for DAIDS Clinical Trials Networks.  
8.6 Pharmacy records  
The HVTN CRS pharmacist is required to maintain complete records of all study 
products. The pharmacist of record is responsible for maintaining randomization 
codes and randomization confirmation notices for each participant in a secure 
manner.  
8.7 Final disposition of study products  
All unused study products must be returned to the CRPMC after the study is 
completed or terminated unless otherwise instructed by the CRPMC. The 
HVTN 122  Version 1.0  / September 27, 2017  
HVTN122_v1.0_FINAL  / Page 47 of 109 procedures and relevant form are included in the Pharmacy Gu idelines and 
Instructions for DAIDS Clinical Trials Networks.  
HVTN 122  Version 1.0  / September 27, 2017  
HVTN122_v1.0_FINAL  / Page 48 of 109 9 Clinical procedures  
The schedule of clinical procedures is shown in Appendix F  . 
9.1 Informed consent  
Informed consent is the process of working with participants so that they fully 
understand what will and may happen to them while participating in a research 
study.  The HVTN informed consent form documents that a participant (1) has 
been informed about the  potential risks, benefits, and alternatives to participation, 
and (2) is willing to participate in an HVTN study. Informed consent 
encompasses all written or verbal study information HVTN CRS staff provide to 
the participant, before and during the trial. HVTN CRS staff will obtain informed 
consent of participants according to HVTN policies and procedures.  
The informed consent process continues throughout the study. Key study concepts 
should be reviewed periodically with the participant and the review shoul d be 
documented. At each study visit, HVTN CRS staff should consider reviewing the 
procedures and requirements for that visit and for the remaining visits. 
Additionally, if any new information is learned that might affect the participants’ 
decisions to sta y in the trial, this information will be shared with trial participants. 
If necessary, participants will be asked to sign revised informed consent forms.  
An HVTN CRS may employ recruitment efforts prior to the participant 
consenting. For example, some HVTN  CRSs use a telephone script to prescreen 
people before they come to the clinic for a full screening visit. Participants must 
sign a screening or protocol -specific consent before any procedures are performed 
to determine eligibility. HVTN CRSs must submit recruitment and prescreening 
materials to their IRB/EC and any applicable RE  for human subjects protection 
review and approval.  
Note: As defined in the DAIDS Protocol Registration Manual, an RE is “Any 
group other than the local IRB/EC responsible for revi ewing and/or approving a 
clinical research protocol and site -specific ICFs  [informed consent forms]  prior to 
implementation at a site.” CRSs are responsible for knowing the requirements of 
their applicable REs.  
9.1.1  Screening consent form  
Without a general scre ening consent, screening for a specific study cannot take 
place until the site receives protocol registration from the DAIDS RSC Protocol 
Registration Office . 
Some HVTN CRSs have approval from their IRB/EC and any applicable RE  to 
use a general screening c onsent form that allows screening for an unspecified HIV 
vaccine trial. In this way, HVTN CRS staff can continually screen potential 
participants and, when needed, proceed quickly to obtain protocol -specific 
HVTN 122  Version 1.0  / September 27, 2017  
HVTN122_v1.0_FINAL  / Page 49 of 109 enrollment consent. Sites conducting general scr eening or prescreening approved 
by their IRB/EC and any applicable RE  may use the results from this screening to 
determine eligibility for this protocol, provided the tests are conducted within the 
time periods specified in the eligibility criteria.  
9.1.2  Proto col-specific consent forms  
The protocol -specific consent forms describe the study products to be used and all 
aspects of protocol participation, including screening and enrollment procedures. 
A sample protocol -specific consent form for the main study is lo cated in 
Appendix A . A separate sample consent form for other uses of specimens is 
located in Appendix C . 
Each HVTN CRS is responsible for  developing a protocol -specific consent 
form (s) for local use, based on the sample protocol -specific consent form s in 
Appendix A  and Appendix C . The consent form (s) must be developed in 
accordance with requirements of the following:  
 CRS’s IRB/EC  and any applicable RE s, 
 CRS’s institution, and  
 Elements of informed consent as described in Title 45, CFR Part 46 and Title 
21 CFR, Part 50, and in t he International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) 
E6, Good Clinical Practice: Consolidated Guidance 4.8.  
Study sites are strongly encouraged to have their local CABs review their sites -
specific consent forms. This review should include, but should not be  limited to, 
issues of cultural competence, local language considerations, and the level of 
understandability.  
The sample informed consent form includes instructions throughout the document 
for developing specific content.  
Sites should follow the instructi ons in the Protocol -specific Official Memo 
distributed along with this protocol regarding when they may begin using their 
site-specific protocol consent forms.  
Regarding protocol registration, sites should follow procedures outlined in the 
current version of the DAIDS Protocol Registration Manual.  
9.1.3  Assessment of Understanding  
Study staff are responsible for ensuring that participants fully understand the 
study before enrolling them. This process involves reviewing the informed 
consent form with the participa nt, allowing time for the participant to reflect on 
the procedures and issues presented, and answering all questions completely.  
HVTN 122  Version 1.0  / September 27, 2017  
HVTN122_v1.0_FINAL  / Page 50 of 109 An Assessment of Understanding is used to document the participant’s 
understanding of key concepts in this HIV vaccine trial. The participant must 
complete the Assessment of Understanding before enrollment. Staff may provide 
assistance in reading and understanding the questions and responses, if necessary. 
Participants must verbalize understanding of all questions answered incorr ectly. 
This process and the participant’s understanding of the key concepts should be 
recorded in source documentation at the site.  
IRB/EC and any applicable RE  may require that a participant has signed either a 
screening or protocol -specific consent docum ent prior to administering the 
Assessment of Understanding. The consent process (including the use of the 
Assessment of Understanding) should be explained thoroughly to the IRB/EC and 
any applicable RE , whose recommendations should be followed.  
9.2 Pre-enrollm ent procedures  
Screening may occur over the course of several contacts/visits, up to and 
including before vaccination on day 0. All inclusion and exclusion criteria must 
be assessed within 56 days before enrollment, unless otherwise specified in the 
eligib ility criteria (or below in this section).  
After the appropriate informed consent has been obtained and before enrollment, 
the following procedures are performed:  
 Medical history, documented in the case history record;  
 Assessment of whether the volunteer is at low risk for HIV infection;  
 Complete physical examination, including height, weight, vital signs, and 
clinical assessments of head, ears, eyes, nose, and throat; neck; lymph nodes; 
heart; chest; abdomen; extremities; neurological function; and skin;  
 Assessment of concomitant medications the volunteer is taking, including 
prescription and nonprescription drugs, vitamins, topical products, 
alternative/complementary medicines (eg, herbal and health food 
supplements), recreational drugs, vaccinations, and  allergy shots;  
 Laboratory tests as defined in the inclusion and exclusion criteria, including:  
  Screening HIV test  
 CBC with differential and platelet count  
 Chemistry panel (ALT, AST, ALP, and creatinine)  
 Urine dipstick (urinalysis if indicated, see Sectio n 9.7) 
 HBsAg  
 Anti-HCV Ab  
HVTN 122  Version 1.0  / September 27, 2017  
HVTN122_v1.0_FINAL  / Page 51 of 109  Syphilis test  
 Urine or serum pregnancy test (volunteers who were born female. Persons 
who are NOT of reproductive potential due to having undergone total 
hysterectomy  or bilateral oophorectomy  (verified by medical records), are 
not required to undergo pregnancy testing.  
 Administration of behavioral risk assessment questionnaire;  
 Obtaining of volunteer demographics in compliance with the NIH Policy on 
Reporting Race and Ethnicity Data: Subjects in Clinical Research, Aug. 8, 
2001 (available at http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice -files/NOT -OD-01-
053.html);  
 Counseling on HIV testing and risk reduction, performed in compliance with 
the US Ce nters for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)’s current 
guidelines or other local guidelines for HIV counseling, testing, and referral as 
described in Section  9.5; and  
 Discussion of pregnancy prevention. A pregnant or breastfeeding person may 
not be enrolled in this trial. Specific criteria and assessment of contraception 
and pregnancy status are described in study inclusion criteria. Discussion of 
pregnancy prevention includes advising a participant who was born female 
and who reports no current sexual activity that could lead to that participant 
becoming pregnant to have a plan to begin adequate birth control. This plan 
would be put to use if, duri ng the study, the participant becomes sexually 
active in a way that could lead to that participant becoming pregnant.  
9.2.1  Use of screening results from another HVTN study  
If a participant screens for an HVTN study at the same HVTN CRS but then does 
not join t hat study, screening results from that effort may be applied to the 
screening for this protocol, as long as the screening was done under participant 
consent, the participant has signed a consent form to begin screening for this 
study, and the tests were co nducted within the time periods specified in the 
eligibility criteria (see Sections 7.1 and 7.2). 
9.3 Enrollment and vaccination visits  
Enrollment is simultaneous with first vaccination. The HVTN CRS requests the 
randomization assignment via a Web -based randomization system. In general, t he 
time interval between r andomization and enrollment should not exceed 4 working 
days. However, c ircumstances may require a participant’s enrollment visit to be 
changed. This may exceed the 4 -day randomization time limit.  
At all vaccination visits, the following procedures are per formed before 
vaccination:  
HVTN 122  Version 1.0  / September 27, 2017  
HVTN122_v1.0_FINAL  / Page 52 of 109  Abbreviated physical examination, including weight, vital signs, and a 
symptom -directed evaluation by history and/or appropriate physical exam 
based on participant self -reported symptoms or complaints;  
 Assessment of baseline reac togenicity parameters;  
 Assessment of concomitant medications (as described in Section  9.2); 
 Assessment of any new or unresolved AEs/intercurrent il lnesses; and  
 Urine or serum pregnancy test (for participants who were born female).  
Persons who are NOT of reproductive potential due to having undergone total 
hysterectomy  or bilateral oophorectomy  (verified by medical records), are not 
required to underg o pregnancy testing.  
Following completion of all procedures in the preceding list , and if results 
indicate that vaccination may proceed, vaccination is prepared and administered 
(see Sections 8.3 and 8.4). 
Immediately following vaccination, the participant remains in the clinic for 
observation. An initial reactogenicity assessment is made at a target of 30 minutes 
after injection, with an acc eptable range of 25 -60 minutes. Before leaving the 
clinic, the participant is given the postvaccination memory tool  and is instructed 
on how to complete it. The site will make arrangements to be in contact with the 
participant during the reactogenicity per iod (as described in Section  9.8). 
The following procedures will be performed at all vaccination visits. These 
procedures may be performed prior to or following vaccination:  
 Risk reduction counseling (as described in Section  9.5);  
 Pregnancy prevention assessment (as described in Section  9.2 and 9.6); and  
 Assessment of new or unresolved social impacts (site staff will ask participant 
about the status of any unresolved social impacts and if s/he has experienced 
any new social impacts as a r esult of the trial participation).  
Additional procedures will be performed at scheduled visits as specified in  
Appendix F :  
 Confirm that participants received HIV test results from previous visit. If not, 
provide test results and post -test counseling as appropriate;  
 Assess for clinical evidence of vaccinia scarification;  and 
 Specimen collection (should be completed prior to vaccination) . 
HVTN 122  Version 1.0  / September 27, 2017  
HVTN122_v1.0_FINAL  / Page 53 of 109 9.4 Follow -up visits  
The followi ng procedures are performed at all scheduled follow -up visits:  
 Risk reduction counseling (as described in Section  9.5);  
 Pregnancy prevention assessment (as described in Section  9.2 and 9.6); and  
 Assessment of new or unresolved social impacts (site staff will ask participant 
about the status of any unresolved social impacts and if s/he has experienced 
any new social impacts as a result of the trial participation);  
 Assessment of new or continuing concomitant medications (as described in 
Section  9.2); and  
 Assessment of new or unresolved AEs/intercurrent illnesses.  
Additional procedures will be performed at scheduled follow -up visits as 
specified in Appendix F :  
 Administration of the social impact assessment questionnaire (types of 
impa cts assessed involve personal relationships, health insurance, life 
insurance, educational or employment opportunities, housing, immigration, or 
travel);  
 Administration of a questionnaire that asks the participant about any HIV 
testing he or she may have r eceived outside of the study. Participants will also 
be asked whether they believe they received the active vaccine or the control;  
 HIV infection assessment including pre -test counseling. A subsequent follow -
up contact is conducted to provide post -test cou nseling and to report results to 
participant;  
 Confirm that participants received HIV test results from previous visit. If not, 
provide test results and post -test counseling as appropriate;  
 Abbreviated physical examination including weight, vital signs, and  a 
symptom -directed evaluation by history and/or appropriate physical exam 
based on participant self -reported symptoms or complaints;  
 Complete physical examination, including weight, vital signs, and clinical 
assessments of head, ears, eyes, nose, and thro at; neck; lymph nodes; heart; 
chest; abdomen; extremities; neurological function; and skin;  
 Specimen collection;  
 Clinical laboratory tests including:  
 CBC with differential,  
HVTN 122  Version 1.0  / September 2 7, 2017  
HVTN122_v1.0_FINAL  / Page 54 of 109  Chemistry panel (see Section 9.2), and  
 Urine dipstick (urinalysis if appropriate; see Section 9.7); and  
 Urine or serum pregnancy test (for participants who were born female). 
Persons who are NOT of reproductive potential due to having undergone total 
hysterectomy  or bilateral oophorectomy  (verified by medical records), are not 
required to undergo pregnancy t esting.  
9.5 HIV counseling and testing  
HIV counseling will be performed in compliance with the CDC’s guidelines or 
other local guidelines for HIV counseling and referral. HIV testing will be 
performed in accordance with the current HVTN HIV testing algorithm f ollowing 
enrollment.  
Participants will be counseled routinely during the trial on the avoidance of HIV 
infection and on the potential negative social impacts of testing antibody positive 
due to the vaccine. They will also be counseled on the risks of HIV a ntibody 
testing outside of the HVTN CRSs and will be discouraged from doing so during 
study participation and/or during any period of vaccine -induced positive serology.  
Study staff will take particular care to inform study participants of the likelihood 
of routine HIV testing being offered or performed outside the study CRS at 
emergency rooms, clinics, and medical offices. Such testing has become more 
likely due to the CDC’s revised guidelines for HIV counseling and testing, as well 
as policy changes in man y countries to make HIV testing more frequent and 
routine. CRS staff should inform participants of their right to opt out of HIV 
testing outside the study site. CRS staff should inform study participants if local 
and/or state policies and regulations permi t medical providers to perform HIV 
testing without first informing patients. If this is the case, then CRS staff should 
advise study participants that they may decline testing preemptively. CRS staff 
should also inform participants if positive results must  be reported to local public 
health authorities. CRS staff should also inform participants of the need to 
maintain study blinding by getting HIV testing only at the study CRS. CRS staff 
should provide participants with CRS contact information and should en courage 
participants to ask medical providers to contact the CRS. The CRS can verify that 
the participant is in an HIV vaccine clinical trial and should only be tested at the 
study CRS.  
Potential participants identified as being HIV infected during screeni ng are not 
enrolled. All participants who become HIV infected during the study will be 
terminated from this study. Potential and enrolled participants identified as HIV 
infected will be referred for medical treatment, counseling, and management of 
the HIV infection. These individuals may also be referred to appropriate ongoing 
clinical trials or observational studies.  
HVTN 122  Version 1.0  / September 27, 2017  
HVTN122_v1.0_FINAL  / Page 55 of 109 9.5.1  Distinguishing intercurrent HIV infection from vaccine -induced 
positive serology  
The study product may elicit an antibody response to HIV pro teins. Therefore, 
vaccine -induced positive serology may occur in this study. Several precautionary 
measures will be taken to distinguish intercurrent HIV infection from vaccine -
induced positive serology. These precautionary measures include:  
 Participants w ill have physical examinations at visits specified in Appendix F . 
Signs or symptoms of an acute HIV infection syndrome, an intercurrent illness 
consistent with HIV-1 infection, or probable HIV exposure would prompt a 
diagnostic workup per the HVTN algorithm for Recent Exposure/Acute 
Infection Testing to determine HIV infection.  
 HIV testing will be performed at multiple timepoints throughout the study 
(see Appendix F ). The Laboratory Program (or approved diagnostic 
laboratory) will follow the HVTN HIV testing algorithm ( see Study Specific 
Procedures [SSP] ), which is able to  distinguish vaccine -induced antibody 
responses from actual HIV infections.  
 All participants can receive HIV -1 diagnostic testing from the site following 
their last scheduled visit until they are told that they did not receive an HIV 
vaccine or that they do not have vaccine -induced seropositivity.  
 All participants who received vaccine product and who have vaccine -induced 
positive or indeterminate HIV -1 serology (as measured by the standard anti -
HIV antibody screening tests) at or after the study is unblind ed will be offered 
poststudy HIV -1 diagnostic testing (per the HVTN poststudy HIV -1 testing 
algorithm) periodically and free of charge as medically/socially indicated 
(approximately every 6 months)  unless or until HIV Ab testing is no longer 
the standard t est in clinical settings .  
9.5.2  VISP registry  
Experimental HIV vaccines may induce antibody production to HIV antigens, 
producing reactive results on commercially available HIV test kits. This is called 
“vaccine -induced seropositivity” (VISP) (see Section 9.5.1 ). In order to provide 
poststudy HIV testing to distinguish between VISP and HIV infection, and to 
mitigate potential social harms resulting from VISP in HIV vaccine recipients 
who are not infected with HIV, the HVTN has created a VISP registry. Following 
study unblinding, the registry will allow trained staff  to verify that an individual 
has received an HIV vaccine, and therefore has the potential for VISP. 
Information in the VISP registry will not be used for research. Rather, the registry 
exists to support provision of poststudy testing and counseling services to HIV 
vaccine recipients.  The registry contains the names of all study participants, 
unless they request that their names be removed.  
HVTN 122  Version 1.0  / September 27, 2017  
HVTN122_v1.0_FINAL  / Page 56 of 109 9.6 Contraception status  
Contraception status is assessed and documented at every scheduled clinic visit 
for a participant who was born female and who is sexually active in a way that 
could cause that participant to become pregnant. Prior to enrollment and 
throughout the study, staff will ask participants to verbally confirm their use of 
adequate contraceptive methods. A participant who was born female and is 
sexually active in a way that could cause that participa nt to become pregnant 
should be reminded at all scheduled clinic visits of the importance of using 
contraception and should be referred to specific counseling, information, and 
advice as needed. (Specific contraception requirements are listed in Section  7.1). 
This reminder should be documented in the participant’s study record.  
Self-reported infertility —including having reached menopause (no menses for 1 
year) or ha ving undergone hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, or tubal 
ligation —must be documented in the participant’s study record.  
9.7 Urinalysis  
Dipstick testing may be performed in the clinic or the lab, as long as the required 
elements (glucose, protein, and hemo globin) are tested. The examination is 
performed on urine obtained by clean catch.  
If the screening dipstick is transiently abnormal due to menses or infection, 
document this issue in the participant’s source documentation. For infection, 
provide appropria te treatment and/or referral. Following resolution, repeat the 
dipstick and, if within the eligibility limits specified in the protocol, the 
participant may be enrolled.  
Follow -up urinalysis should be deferred if a participant is menstruating, but 
should b e performed as soon as possible. If a follow -up dipstick is abnormal due 
to a participant’s menstrual period, document in the comment section of the case 
report form (CRF) and repeat the dipstick once the participant is no longer 
menstruating. A micro -urinalysis is not required.  
9.8 Assessments of reactogenicity  
For all participants, baseline assessments are performed before and reactogenicity 
assessments are performed after each vaccination. All reactogenicity symptoms 
are followed until resolution and graded according to the Division of AIDS Table 
for Grading the Severity of Adul t and Pediatric Adverse Events , Corrected 
Version 2.1, dated July 2017, except as noted in Section 11.2.2  . 
The reactogenicity assessment period is 7 full days following each vaccination per 
the assessment schedule shown in Table 9-1. Participants are instructed to record 
symptoms using a postvacci nation memory tool. Contact between the participant 
and the CRS staff should take place at least once within the 3 days following 
HVTN 122  Version 1.0  / September 27, 2017  
HVTN122_v1.0_FINAL  / Page 57 of 109 vaccination. Clinic staff will follow new or unresolved reactoge nicity symptoms 
present at day 7  to resolution. Participants a re instructed to contact the clinic for 
events that arise during the period between vaccination and the next scheduled 
visit. In general, a participant who self -reports any postvaccination reaction 
greater than mild is seen by a clinician within 48 hours a fter onset, unless the 
reaction is improving and/or has completely resolved.  
Reactogenicity events are reported using CRFs that correspond to the time of 
assessment in Table 9-1. Reactogenicity assessments include assessments of 
systemic and local symptoms, vaccine -related lesions, and lymph nodes. Events 
not listed on a CRF, or with an onset after the reactogenicity assessment period 
(day of vaccinati on and 7  full days after), or those meeting SAE/adverse events 
requiring expedited reporting to DAIDS criteria, are recorded on an adverse event  
log form.  
Table 9-1 Schedule of reactogenicity assessments

a Day of vaccination  
b New or unresolved reactogenicity symptoms present on day 7 are followed until resolution  
9.8.1  Assessment of systemic and local symptoms  
Systemic symptoms include increased body temperature, malaise and/or fatigue, 
myalgia, headache, chills, arthralgia, nausea, and vomiting. Local symptoms 
include pain and/or tenderness at the injection site. The daily maximum severity 
reached for each symptom during the assessment period is reported.  
Body temperature is measured by oral or infrared thermometry and reported in 
degrees Celsius. If temperature is measured in Fahrenheit, the c onversion to 
Celsius should be documented in the participant’s chart note. A measurement is 
taken once daily during the assessment period and should be repeated if 
participant is feeling feverish.  
9.8.2  Assessment of injection site  
Typical injection site reactio ns are erythema/ redness and induration/swelling. The 
maximum horizontal and maximum vertical measurements for all injection site 
reactions are recorded.  
All injection site reactions are monitored until resolution. Areas greater than 25 
cm2 are followed dai ly; otherwise, the frequency of follow -up is based on 
clinician judgment.  
HVTN 122  Version 1.0  / September 27, 2017  
HVTN122_v1.0_FINAL  / Page 58 of 109 9.8.3  Assessment of lymph nodes  
This assessment is required only when reactogenicity assessments are performed 
by HVTN CRS staff, not by the participant.  
Only the proximally draining lymph  nodes are assessed (eg, axillary nodes on the 
same side of the body for injections given in the deltoid). Lymph nodes are first 
evaluated for enlargement and tenderness. If they are found to be enlarged, 
measurements are taken to determine the size (wides t diameter) of the enlarged 
node(s).  
9.9 Visit windows and missed visits  
Visit windows are defined in HVTN 122  Study Specific Procedures. For a visit 
not performed within the window period, a Missed Visit form is completed. If the 
missed visit is one that required safety assessments or local safety labs, HVTN 
CRS staff should attempt to bring the participant in for an interim visit as soon as 
possible.  
Procedures performed at an interim visit are usually toxicity/safety assessme nts 
(including local safety labs) and HIV testing. With the exception of HIV testing, 
these procedures are performed only if they were required at the missed visit or if 
clinically indicated. HIV testing may be performed as deemed appropriate by the 
study staff. Blood samples for immunogenicity assays are not typically collected 
at interim visits.  
If a missed visit required vaccination, please refer to Section  7.3.2  and Section  
7.3.3  for resolution.  
9.10 Early termination visit  
In the event of early participant termination, site staff should consider  if the 
following assessments are appropriate: a final physical examination, clinical 
laboratory tests (including urine dipstick, CBC with differential, and chemistry 
panel), pregnancy testing, social impact assessment, and HIV test.  
9.11 Pregnancy  
If a participant becomes pregnant during the course of the study, no more 
injections of study product will be given, but remaining visits and study 
procedures should be completed unless medically contraindicated or applicable  
regulations require terminatio n from the study. If the participant terminates from 
the study prior to the pregnancy outcome, the site should make every effort to 
keep in touch with the participant in order to ascertain the pregnancy outcome.  
Pregnancies and pregnancy outcomes will be r eported.  
HVTN 122  Version 1.0  / September 27, 2017  
HVTN122_v1.0_FINAL  / Page 59 of 109 10 Laboratory  
10.1 HVTN CRS laboratory procedures  
The HVTN 122  Site Lab Instructions  and SSP provide further guidelines for 
operational issues concerning the clinical and processing laboratories. This 
document  includes guid elines for general specimen collection, special 
considerations for phlebotomy , specimen labeling , whole blood processing,  HIV 
screening/diagnostic testing,  and general screening and safety testing.  
Tube types for blood collection are specified in Appendix E . For tests performed 
locally, the local lab may assign appropriate tube types.  
In specific situations, the blood collection tubes may be redirected to another 
laboratory or may require study -specific processing techniques. In these cases, 
laboratory special instructions will be posted on the protocol -specific section of 
the HVTN website.  
10.2 Total blood volume  
Required blood volumes per visit are shown in Appendix E . Not shown is any 
additional blood volume that would be required if a safety lab needs to be 
repeated, or if a serum pregnancy test needs to be performed . The additional 
blood volume would likely be minimal. The total blood volume drawn for each 
participant will not exceed 500 mL in any 56 -day (8 -week) period.  
10.3 Primary immunogenicity timepoint s 
The primary immunogenicity timepoint s in this study  occur 2  weeks after the first 
and third vaccinations . Endpoint assays for humoral and cellular responses are 
performed on participants at the primary immunogenicity timepoint s and may be 
performed at baseline. Depending on the number of responders observed, assays 
for humoral and cellular responses may be performed on participants at other 
timepoints; the schedule is shown in Appendix E . 
10.4 Endpoint assays: cellular  
10.4.1  Flow cytometry  
Flow cytometry will be used to examine vaccine -specific CD4+ and CD8+ T -cell 
responses following stimulation of PBMCs with synthetic HIV peptides that span 
the proteins encoded by the vaccine. ICS parameters will include cytokines such 
as IFN -γ, interleuk in (IL) -2, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -α, and may include 
other cytokines (such as cytokines relevant to Th2 and Th17 responses) to identify 
T cells of specific functionality. Markers of cytotoxic potential (eg, Granzyme B) 
HVTN 122  Versio n 1.0  / September 27, 2017  
HVTN122_v1.0_FINAL  / Page 60 of 109 and of Tfh functionality (eg , CXCR5 and PD -1) may also be included. Data will 
be reported as percentages of CD4+ or CD8+ T cells responding to a specific 
peptide pool. Additional cell surface markers, cytokines, or functional markers 
may also be analyzed . 
10.5 Endpoint assays: humoral  
10.5.1  Binding antibody multiplex assay   
HIV-specific IgG  antibodies will be assessed on plasma/serum samples from 
study participants taken at the primary immunogenicity timepoint s and baseline. 
IgG subclass and IgA assays may also be performed. Specimens from other  
timepoints may also be assayed based on the results of the initial assay.  
10.5.2  Neutralizing antibody assay  
HIV-1–specific nAb assays will be performed on serum samples from study 
participants taken at the primary immunogenicity timepoint s. Specimens from the 
baseline and other timepoints may also be analyzed at the discretion of the HVTN 
Laboratory Program, which may be contingent on the results of the primary 
immunogenicity timepoint s. The TZM -bl assay will test neutralization of the 
vaccine strain ( CO6980 ) and a single h ighly neutralization -sensitive T ier 1 virus 
as a positive control (MW965.26). The global panel and/or clade -specifi c panels 
may be used to assess T ier 2 neutralization [41,42] . 
10.6 Genotyping  
Molecular human leukocyte antigen (HLA) typing may be performed on enrolled 
participants using cryopreserved PBMC collected at baseline, initially on 
specimens from participa nts who demonstrate vaccine -induced T -cell responses at 
postvaccination timepoints. Other participants (including control recipients) may 
be HLA -typed to support future studies of immunological interest at the discretion 
of the HVTN Laboratory Program. Oth er markers, such as genes associated with 
immune responses or HIV -1disease progression  may also be assessed .  
10.7 Lab assay algorithm  
The Lab Assay Algorithm lists assays to characterize cellular, humoral, and innate 
immune responses as well as host genetics t hat may be conducted to determine 
endpoints in HVTN vaccine trials.  The type of assay(s) employed will be 
dependent on the response obtained by the primary immunogenicity assays at 
relevant timepoint s. Please note that the Lab Assay Algorithm will be updat ed 
periodically to include new assays.  
HVTN 122  Version 1.0  / September 27, 2017  
HVTN122_v1.0_FINAL  / Page 61 of 109 10.8 Exploratory studies  
Samples may be used for other testing and research related to furthering the 
understanding of HIV immunology or vaccines. In addition, cryopreserved 
samples may be used to perform additional assays  to support standardization and 
validation of existing or newly developed methods.   
10.8.1  Tfh phenotyping  
Flow cytometry may be used to identify peripheral blood follicular helper T 
(pTfh) cells  and peripheral T follicular regulatory (pTfr) cells . Phenotyping of 
pTfh and pTfr cells will be based on expression of CXCR5 , PD-1, CD127, and 
CD25  on CD4+ T cells, and may include additional markers. For example, if flow 
cytometry panels are successfully developed to assess CD69, OX40, IL -21, and 
CD154 ex pression as a functional read -out, vaccine -specific Tfh cells may be 
assessed and isolated for further analysis.  
10.8.2  B cell plasmablasts  
Flow cytometry may be used to identify the  early precursors for antibody -
secreting B cells, called B cell  plasmablasts, in the peripheral  blood.  Plasmablasts 
will be mainly characterized by  CD19+ CD20 - and high expression of CD27 and 
CD38. The flow cytometry panels might also include additional markers  and 
assessment of antigen specificity.  
10.8.3  Vaccinia neutralizing antibody assa y 
Neutralizing antibody assays may be performed on serum samples collected at 
baseline to assess participant exposure to vaccinia.  
10.9 Specimen storage and o ther use of specimens  
The HVTN stores specimens from all study participants indefinitely, unless a 
participant requests that specimens be destroyed or if required by IRB/EC, or RE.  
Other use of specimens is defined as studies not covered by  the protocol  or the 
informed consent form for the main study ( Appendix A ). 
This research may relate to HIV, vaccines, the immune system, and other 
diseases. This could include limited genetic testing and, potentially, genome -wide 
studies. This research is done only  to the extent authorized in each CRS ’s 
informed consent form, or as otherwise autho rized under applicable law. Other 
testing on specimens (“other use”) will occur only after review and approval by 
the HVTN, the IRB/EC of the researcher requesting the specimens, and the CRS’s 
IRBs/ECs /REs  if required.  
As part of consenting for the study, participants document their initial decision to 
allow or not allow their specimens to be used in other research, and they may 
HVTN 122  Version 1.0  / September 27, 2017  
HVTN122_v1.0_FINAL  / Page 62 of 109 change their decision at any time. The participant’s initial decision about other 
use of their specimens, and any later change to that decision, is recorded by their 
CRS in a Web -based tool that documents their current decisions for other use of 
their specimens. The HVTN will only allow other research to be done on 
specimens from participants who allow such use.   
CRSs must notify HV TN Regulatory Affairs if institutional or local governmental 
requirements pose a conflict with or impose restrictions on specimen storage or 
other use of specimens.  
10.10  Biohazard containment  
As the transmission of HIV and other blood -borne pathogens can occur through 
contact with contaminated needles, blood, and blood products, appropriate 
precautions will be employed by all personnel in the drawing of blood and 
shipping and handling of all specimens for this study, as currently recommended 
by the CDC and the N IH or other applicable agencies.  
All dangerous goods materials, including Biological Substances, Category A or 
Category B, must be transported according to instructions detailed in the 
International Air Transport Association Dangerous Goods Regulations.

11.1 Safety monitoring and oversight  
11.1.1  HVTN 122  PSRT  
The HVTN 122  PSRT is composed of the following members:  
 DAIDS medical officer representative,  
 Protocol chair and  cochair,  
 Protocol Team leader,  
 Core medical monitor, and  
 Clinical safety specialist . 
The clinician members of HVTN 122  PSRT are responsible for decisions related 
to participant safety.  
The Protocol Team clinic coordinator, clinical data  manager, vaccine developer 
representative, clinical trial manager, and others may also be included in HVTN 
122 PSRT meetings.  
11.1.2  HVTN SMB  
The SMB is a multidisciplinary group consisting of biostatisticians, clinic ians, 
and experts in HIV vaccine research that, collectively, has experience in the 
conduct and monitoring of vaccine trials. Members of the SMB are not directly 
affiliated with the protocols under review.  
The SMB reviews safety data, unblinded as to trea tment arm, approximately 
every 4 months . The reviews consist of evaluation of cumulative reactogenicity 
events, AE, laboratory safety data, and individual reports of adverse events 
requiring expedited reporting to DAIDS. The SMB conducts additional special  
reviews at the request of the HVTN 122  PSRT.  
Study sites will receive SMB summary minutes and are responsible for 
forwarding them to their IRB/EC and any applicable RE . 
11.1.3  SDMC roles and responsibilities in safety monitoring  
The roles and responsibilities of the SDMC in relation to safety monitoring 
include:  
HVTN 122  Version 1.0  / September 27, 2017  
HVTN122_v1.0_FINAL  / Page 64 of 109  Maintaining a central database management system for HVTN clinical data;  
and 
 Providing reports of clinical data to appropriate groups such as the HVTN 122  
PSRT and HVTN SMB (see Section 11.1.2 ). 
11.1.4  HVTN Core roles and responsibilities in safety monitoring  
 Daily monitoring of clinical data for events that meet the safety pause and 
HVTN 122  PSRT AE review criteria (see Section  11.4); 
 Notifying HVTN CRSs and other groups when safety pauses or planned holds 
are instituted and lifted (see Section 11.4); 
 Querying HVTN C RSs for additional information regarding reported clinical 
data; and  
 Providing support to the HVTN 122  PSRT.  
11.2 Safety reporting  
11.2.1  Submission of safety forms to SDMC  
Sites must submit all safety forms (eg, reactogenicity, advers e experience, 
urinalysis, local lab results, concomitant medications) before the end of the next 
business day after receiving the information. The forms should not be held in 
anticipation of additional information at a later date. If additional information  is 
received at a later date, the forms should be updated and resubmitted  before the 
end of the next business day after receiving the new information.  
11.2.2  AE reporting  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant 
administere d a study product/procedure(s) and which does not necessarily have a 
causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable 
and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or 
disease temporally associated w ith the use of an investigational study 
product/procedure(s), whether or not related to the investigational study 
product/procedure(s). All AEs are graded according to the Division of AIDS 
Table for Grading the Severity of Adul t and Pediatric Adverse Event s, Corrected 
Version 2.1, dated July 2017, available on the RSC website at http://rsc.tech -
res.com/clinical -research -sites/safety -reporting/daids -grading -tables , except : 
 Unintentional w eight loss is required to be reported as an AE only if it is 
considered  to be potentially deleterious to the participant’s health  (see HVTN 
122 Study Specific Procedures ); 
HVTN 122  Version 1.0  / September 27, 2017  
HVTN122_v1.0_FINAL  / Page 65 of 109  Injection Site Erythema or Redness and Injection Site Induration or Swelling 
will not consider interference with usual social and functional activities such 
that: 
 Grade 1 is: 2.5 to < 5 cm in diameter OR 6.25 to < 25 cm2 surface area;  
 Grade 2 is: ≥ 5 to < 10 cm in diameter OR ≥ 25 to < 100 cm2 surface area;  
 Grade 3 is: ≥ 10 cm in diameter OR ≥ 100 cm2 surface area OR Ulceration 
OR Secondary infection OR P hlebitis OR Sterile abscess OR Drainage;  
 Grade 4 is:  Potentially life -threatening consequences ( eg, abscess, 
exfoliative dermatitis, necrosis involving dermis or deeper tissue);  
During the study period, a ll AEs are reported to the SDMC on the appropriate 
CRF. Clinic staff should evaluate every AE to determine if (1) the AE meets the 
requirements for expedited reporting to DAIDS ( Section  11.2.3 ) and (2 ) if the AE 
meets the criteria for a safety pause/prompt AE review ( Section  11.4). 
Sites are expected to notify HVTN clinical safety staff  of any serious safety 
concern requiring their attention (see  Table 11-1). Telephone numbers and email 
addresses  are found  on the  protocol home page on the HVTN Members’ site 
(https://members.hvtn.org/protocols/hvtn 122). Concerns requiring immediate 
attention should be communicated by calling the  clinical  safety phone.  
In the case of email notification, the CSS  will reply during working hours (US 
Pacif ic Time) to confirm that the email has been received and reviewed. If email 
service is not available, the HVTN CRS should notify the CSS  of the event by 
telephone, then submit CRFs.  
In addition, site investigators are required to submit AE information in a ccordance 
with IRB/EC and any applicable RE  requirements.  
11.2.3  Expedited reporting of adverse events to DAIDS  
Requirements, definitions and methods for expedited reporting of AEs are 
outlined in Version 2.0 (January 2010) of the Manual for Expedited Reporting o f 
Adverse Events to DAIDS (DAIDS EAE Manual), which is available on the RSC 
website at http://rsc.tech -res.com/clinical -research -sites/safety -reporting/manual . 
The SAE Reporting Category will be used for this study.  
The internet -based DAIDS Adverse Experi ence Reporting System (DAERS) must 
be used for expedited AE reporting to DAIDS. In the event of system outages or 
technical difficulties, expedited AE reports may be submitted via the DAIDS EAE 
Form. For questions about DAERS, please contact  CRMSsupport@ni aid.nih.gov  
or from within the DAERS application itself.  
The study products for which expedited reporting are required are :  
 gp145 C.6980  with aluminum hydroxide adjuvant   
HVTN 122  Version 1.0  / September 27, 2017  
HVTN122_v1.0_FINAL  / Page 66 of 109  placebo (Sodium Chloride for Injection, 0.9%)   
The expedited reporting period for this study comprises the entire study period for 
each individual participant (from study enrolment until study completion or 
discontinuation from the study). During this period the SAE Reporting Category 
will be used.   
After the protocol -defined AE reporting period for the study, unless otherwise 
noted, only Suspected, Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions as defined in 
Version 2.0 of the DAIDS EAE Manual must be reported to DAIDS, if the study 
staff become aware of the eve nts.  
The NIAID/DAIDS will report all unexpected SAEs related to the study products 
observed in this clinical trial to the FDA in accordance with 21 CFR 312.32 (IND 
Safety Reports).  However, because safety is a primary study endpoint, the 
Sponsor Medical O fficer will not routinely be unblinded to study treatment 
assignment when there is an assessment of relatedness of the SAE with the study 
product(s); and the safety report will be sent to the FDA based on the blinded 
attribution assessment.  
If the PSRT bel ieves unblinding is appropriate ( eg, if unblinding to treatment 
assignment will assist with the clinical management of the SAE ), the PSRT will 
consult the independent HVTN SMB for a recommendation. In the event the 
HVTN SMB determines that unblinding is in dicated, the SMB will inform the 
individual ( eg, site physician ) of the participant’s treatment assignment in such a 
manner as to maintain the study blind of the PSRT and study team. For additional 
impact and management of SAEs on the study, see Section  11.4. 
11.3 Initial safety evaluation  
Enrollment will proceed in all groups simultaneously and will be restricted to a 
maximum of 1 participant per day until 5 participants  in Group 1, 3 participants in 
Group 2 and 1 placebo recipient in Group 3  have been enrolled. The HVTN 122  
PSRT will review the cumulative safety data  through 2 weeks postvaccination on 
each of these participants  and will d etermine whether it is safe t o proceed with 
full enrollment.  
11.4 Safety pause and prompt PSRT AE review  
When a trial is placed on safety pause, all enrollment and vaccination with the 
product related to the event that triggered the pause will be held until fur ther 
notice. The AEs that will lead to a safety pause or prompt HVTN 122  PSRT AE 
review are summarized in Table 11-1. Vaccinations may be suspended for safety 
concerns other than those described in the table, or before pause rules are met, if, 
in the judgment of the HVTN 122  PSRT, participant safety may be threatened. 
Criteria for an individual participant’s departure from the schedule of vaccinations 
are listed in Section  7.3.

(https://members.hvtn.org/protocols/hvtn ###). 
b Does not include subjective reactogenicity symptoms (injection site pain, tenderness, fatigue/malaise, 
myalgia, arthralgia, chills, headache, nausea).  
For all safety pauses, HVTN Core notifies the HVTN 122  PSRT, HVTN 
Regulatory Affairs, DAIDS Pharmaceutical Affairs Branch (PAB), DAIDS 
Regulatory Affairs Branch (RAB), DAIDS Safety and Pharmacovigilance Team 
(SPT), and participating HVTN CRSs. When an immediate safety pause is 
triggered, HVTN Core notifies the SMB.  
Once a trial is paused, the HVTN 122  PSRT reviews safety data and decides 
whether the pause can be lifted or permanent discontinuation of vaccination is 
appropriate, consulting the SMB if necessary. HVTN Core  notifie s the 
participating HVTN CRSs, HVTN Regulatory Affairs, DAIDS PAB, DAIDS 
RAB, and DAIDS SPT of the decision regarding resumption or discontinuation of 
study vaccinations. Based on the HVTN 122  PSRT assessment, DAIDS RAB 
notifies the FDA as needed.  
If an immediate HVTN 122  PSRT notification or prompt HVTN 122  PSRT AE 
review is triggered, HVTN Core  notifies the HVTN 122  PSRT as soon  as possible 
during working hours (US Pacific Time) —or, if the information was received 
during off hours, by the morning of the next work day. If a prompt HVTN 122  
PSRT AE review cannot be completed within 72 hours of notifi cation (excluding 
weekends and US federal holidays), an automatic safety pause occurs.  
The HVTN requires that each CRS submit  to its IRB/EC and any applicable RE 
protocol -related safety information (such as IND safety reports, notification of 
vaccine holds  due to the pause rules, and notification of other unplanned safety 
pauses).  CRSs must also follow all applicable RE reporting requirements.  
In addition, all other AEs are reviewed routinely by the HVTN 122  PSRT (see 
Section  11.5.2 ). 
HVTN 122  Version 1.0  / September 27, 2017  
HVTN122_v1.0_FINAL  / Page 68 of 109 11.5 Review of cumulative safety data  
Routine safety review occurs at the start of enrollment and then throughout the 
study.  
Reviews proceed f rom a standardized set of protocol -specific safety data reports. 
These reports are produced by the SDMC and include queries to the HVTN CRSs. 
Events are tracked by internal reports until resolution.  
11.5.1  Daily review  
Blinded daily safety reviews are routinely conducted by HVTN Core for events 
requiring expedited reporting to DAIDS, and events that meet safety pause criteria 
or prompt HVTN 122  PSRT AE review criteria.  
11.5.2  Weekly review  
During the injection phase of the trial, the HVTN 122  PSRT review s clinical 
safety reports on a weekly basis and conduct s calls to review the data as 
appropriate. After the injections and the final 2 -week safety visits are completed, 
less frequent reporting and safety reviews may be conducted at the discretion of 
the HVTN 122  PSRT. HVTN Core  reviews reports of clinical and laboratory 
AEs. Events identified during the review that are considered questionable, 
inconsistent, or unexplained are referred to the HVTN CRS clinic coordinator for 
verification.  
11.6 Study termination  
This study may be terminat ed early by the determination of the HVTN 122  PSRT, 
the US FDA , NIH, Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP), or vaccine 
developer(s).  In addition, the conduct of this study at an individual HVTN CRS 
may be terminated by the determination of the IRB/EC and any applicable RE .

HVTN 122  Version 1.0  / September 27, 2017  
HVTN122_v1.0_FINAL  / Page 70 of 109 12.1 Social impacts  
Participants in this study risk experiencing discrimination or other personal 
problems, resulting from  the study participation itself or from the development of 
VISP. The HVTN CRS is obliged to provide advocac y for and assistance to 
participants regarding these negative social impacts associated with the vaccine 
trial. If HVTN CRS staff have questions regarding ways to assist a participant 
dealing with a social impact, a designated NIAID or HVTN Core representa tive 
can be contacted.  
Social harms are tabulated by the SDMC and are subjected to descriptive analysis. 
The goal is to reduce their incidence and enhance the ability of study staff to 
mitigate them when possible.  
Summary tables of social impact events will be generated weekly, and made 
available for review by the protocol chairs, protocol team leader, and the 
designated NIAID representative . 
12.2 Emergency communication with study participants  
As in all clinical researc h, this study may generate a need to reach participants 
quickly to avoid imminent harm, or to report study findings that may otherwise 
concern their health or welfare.  
When such communication is needed, the CRS will request that its IRB/EC and 
any applica ble RE  expedite review of the message. If this review cannot be 
completed in a timeframe consistent with the urgency of the required 
communication, the site should contact the participant first, and then notify the 
IRB/EC and any applicable RE  of the matte r as soon as possible.

Thank you for your interest in our research study. Please read this consent form or 
ask someone to read it to you. If you decide to join the study, we will ask you to 
sign or make your mark on this form. We will offer you a copy to keep. We will 
ask you questions to see if we have explained everything clearly. You can also  
ask us questions about the study.  
Research is not the same as treatment or medical care. The purpose of a research 
study is to answer scientific questions.  
About the study  
The HIV Vaccine Trials Network (HVTN) and [Insert site name]   are doing a 
study to test an HIV vaccine. HIV is the virus that causes AIDS.  
About 45 people will take part in this study at multiple sites. The researcher in 
charge of this study at this clinic is [Insert name of site PI] . The U S National 
Institutes of Health (NIH) is paying for the study.  
1. We are doing this study to answer several questions.  
 Is the study vaccine safe to give to people?  
 Are people able to take the study vaccine without becoming too 
uncomfortable?  
 How do people’s immune systems respond to the study vaccine? (Your 
immune system protects you from disease.)  
2. The study vaccine cannot give you HIV.  
The study vaccine is not made from actual HIV. It is impossible for the study 
vaccine to give you HIV. Also, it cannot cause  you to give HIV to someone else.  
3. We do not know if the study vaccine will decrease, increase, or not change 
your risk of becoming infected with HIV if you are exposed to the virus.  
Site: Any change to the following boxed text  requires approval from HVTN 
Regulatory Affairs  at vtn.core.reg@hvtn.org . 
HVTN 122  Version 1.0  / September 27, 2017  
HVTN122_v1.0_FINAL  / Page 82 of 109 Several studies have tested whether HIV vaccines can reduce the risk of getting 
HIV from another person. In some studies, people who got the vaccine seemed to 
have the same  risk of getting HIV as people who did n ot get the vaccine. In one 
study, people who got the vaccine seemed to have a lower  risk of getting HIV 
than people who did not get the vaccine. In studies with a different vaccine, some 
people who got the vaccine had a higher  risk of getting HIV than peop le who did 
not get the vaccine.  
We do not know whether the vaccine in this study will affect your risk of getting 
HIV from another person. The risk could be higher, lower, or unchanged. It’s very 
important to avoid exposure to HIV during and after the study. We will tell you 
how to avoid HIV.  
4. This study vaccine is experimental.  
The study vaccine is called gp145 C.6980 . From here on, we will call it gp145 or 
the study vaccine. It is an experimental HIV vaccine. That means we do not know 
if the vaccine wi ll be safe to use in people, or if it will work to prevent HIV 
infection. This vaccine is used only in research studies.  
The vaccine was developed by the US Military HIV Research Program and is 
being supplied for this study by the Division of AIDS at the U S National 
Institutes of Health.  
This protein vaccine is a man -made copy of a piece of a protein found on the 
outside of HIV. This protein has been changed in order to strengthen the immune 
response made by the body’s immune system. This protein is mixed with an 
adjuvant called alum. An adjuvant is something added to the vaccine to help the 
immune system respond better. Alum is the most widely used vaccine adjuvant. It 
has been used in licensed vaccines given to hundreds of millions of people all 
over the world.  
This study vaccine has not been given to people before. In one study it was  tested 
in monkeys in combination with another vaccine without causing health problems 
(no changes in weight or temperature).  Similar HIV protein vaccines mixed with 
alum adjuvant have been given to more than 12,000 people in clinical trials 
without causing any serious health problems.  
General risks of vaccines:  
All vaccines can cause fever, chills, rash, aches and pains, nausea, headache, 
dizziness, and feeling tired. Vacc ines can also cause pain, redness, swelling, or 
itching where you got the injection. Most people can still do their planned 
activities after getting a vaccine. Rarely, people have side effects that limit their 
normal activities or make them go to the docto r. 
HVTN 122  Version 1.0  / September 27, 2017  
HVTN122_v1.0_FINAL  / Page 83 of 109 Rarely, a vaccine can cause an allergic reaction, including a rash, hives, or trouble 
breathing. Allergic reactions can be life -threatening. You should tell us if you 
have ever had a bad reaction to any injection or vaccine.  
Very rarely, a vaccine cause s an autoimmune disease in a person, or makes an 
autoimmune disease worse. An autoimmune disease happens when your immune 
system  attacks your own body, instead of attacking an infection.  
Joining the study  
5. It is completely up to you whether or not to join t he study.  
Take your time in deciding. If it helps, talk to people you trust, such as your 
doctor, friends or family. If you decide not to join this study, or if you leave it 
after you have joined, your other care at this clinic and the benefits or rights you 
would normally have will not be affected.  
If you join this study, you may not be allowed to join other HIV vaccine or HIV 
prevention studies now or in the future. You cannot be in this study while you are 
in another study where you get a study product.  Being in more than one study 
may not be safe. Also during the study, you should not donate blood or tissue.  
If you choose not to join this study, you may be able to join another study.  
Site: Remove item 6 if you us e a separate screening consent that covers these 
procedures.  
6. If you want to join the study, we will screen you to see if you are eligible.  
Screening involves a physical exam, HIV test and health history. A physical exam 
may include, but is not limited to:  
 Checking your weight, temperature and blood pressure  
 Looking in your mouth and throat  
 Listening to your heart and lungs  
 Feeling your abdomen (stomach and liver)  
We will also do blood and urine tests. These tests tell us about some aspects of 
your health, such as how healthy your kidneys, liver, and immune system are. We 
will also test you for Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, and syphilis. We will ask you about 
medication s you are taking. We will ask you about behaviors that might put you 
at risk for getting HIV. If you were born female, we will test you for pregnancy.  
We will review the screening results with you. The screening results may show 
you are not eligible to jo in the study, even if you want to.  
HVTN 122  Version 1.0  / September 27, 2017  
HVTN122_v1.0_FINAL  / Page 84 of 109 (Site: adapt the following section so it is applicable to the care available at your site)  
7. If we find that you have a health problem during screening or during the 
study,  we will tell you about the care that we can give here for free.  
For the care that we cannot give, we will explain how we will help you get care 
elsewhere. For health problems that are unrelated to the study, we will not pay for 
care.  
8. If you were born female and could become pregnant, you must agree to us e 
birth control to join this study.  
Site: If you want to include Appendix B, Approved birth control methods (for sample 
informed consent form), in this consent form, paste it below and delete paragraph 
below.  
You should not become pregnant during the study  because we do not know how 
the study vaccine could affect the developing baby. You must agree to use 
effective birth control from 21 days before your first injection until 6 months after 
your last study injection. We  will talk to you about effective  birth  control  
methods.  They are listed  on a handout  that we will give to you.  
Being in the study  
If you meet the study requirements and want to join, here is what will happen:  
9. You will come to the clinic for scheduled visits about [#] times over 
[Insert period of time] . 
Site: Insert number of visits and range of visit lengths. (There is site -specific variation 
in screening protocols and in the number of possible follow -up visits between 
protocol -mandated visits.)  
Visits can last from [#] to [#] hours.  
You may have to come for more visits if you have a lab or health issue.  
We may contact you after the main study ends (for example, to tell you about the 
study results).  
10. We will give you [Site: Insert compensation]  for each study visit you 
complete.  
This amount is to cover the costs of [Site: Insert text]  
Site: Insert any costs to participants (eg, birth control costs for female particip ants 
who could become pregnant).  
HVTN 122  Version 1.0  / September 27, 2017  
HVTN122_v1.0_FINAL  / Page 85 of 109 Payments you receive for being in the study may be taxable. We may need to ask 
you for your Social Security number for tax reasons.  
You do not have to pay anything to be in this study.  
11. We will give you either the study vacc ine or a placebo.  
Not everyone in this study will get the study vaccine. Some people will get a 
placebo, a substance that does not contain vaccine. We will compare the results 
from people who got the placebo with results from people who got the study 
vaccine. In this study, the placebo is sterile salt water.  
You have a 8 -in-9 chance of getting the study vaccine. Site: Modify the 
randomization metaphor in the next sentence as appropriate to your local culture.  
Whether you get the study vaccine or the placebo is completely random, like 
flipping a coin.  
We have no say in whether you get the study vaccine or the placebo. We will not 
know which one you are getting, and neither will you. Only the pharmacist at this 
clinic will have this information while the study is going on.  
You will have to wait until everyone completes their final study visits to find out 
whether you got the study vaccine or the placebo. This could be several years. 
But, if you have a serious me dical problem and need to know what you got before 
the end of the study, we can tell you.  
12. We will give you the study vaccine on a schedule.  
You will be in one of 3 groups. You will get injections of the study vaccine or 
placebo into the upper arm. This will happen 3 times during the study.  
 
  Injection Schedule  
 Number  First injection  2 months later  6 months later  
Group 1  25 High dose gp145 
+ alum  High dose gp145 
+ alum  High dose gp145 
+ alum  
Group 2  15 Low dose gp145 
+ alum  Low dose gp145 
+ alum  Low dose gp145 + 
alum  
Group 3  5 placebo  placebo  placebo  
You will have to wait in the clinic for about a half hour after each injection to see 
if there are any problems. Then that night and for 7 more days, you will need to 
keep track of how you are feeling and if you have any symptoms. Within 3 days 
of your injections , we will also ask you how you are doing. You should always 
contact us  if you have any issues or concerns after getting an injection. If you 
have a problem, we will continue to check on you until it goes away.  
HVTN 122  Version 1.0  / September 2 7, 2017  
HVTN122_v1.0_FINAL  / Page 86 of 109 13. In addition to giving you the study vaccine, we will:  
 Do regular HIV testing, as well as counseling on your results and on how to 
avoid getting HIV;  
 Do physical exams;  
 Do pregnancy t ests if you were born female;  
 Ask questions about your health, including medications you may be taking;  
 Ask questions about any personal problems or benefits you may have from 
being in the study;  
 Test your body’s response to some  vaccines  you may have go tten previously ; 
and 
 Take urine and blood samples.  
When we take blood, the amount will depend on the lab tests we need to do. It 
will be some amount between 17 mL and 180 mL (a little more than 1 tablespoon 
to ¾ cup). Your body will make new blood to repla ce the blood we take out.  
Site: You may want to add a sentence to the end of the previous paragraph 
contextualizing the blood volumes described (eg, “To compare, people who donate 
blood in the US can give a total of about 500 mL in an 8 -week period.”). Mo dify the 
example for cultural relevance and alter blood volumes as necessary.  
Site: Insert Appendix D, Table of procedures (for informed consent form) in this 
section or distribute it as a separate sheet if it is helpful to your study participants. 
You are  not required to do either.  
We will be looking for side effects. We will review the results of these procedures 
and tests with you at your next visit, or sooner if necessary. If any of the results 
are important to your health, we will tell you.  
14. We will co unsel you on avoiding HIV infection.  
We will ask you personal questions about your HIV risk factors such as sexual 
behavior, alcohol, and drug use. We will talk with you about ways to keep your 
risk of getting HIV low.  
15. The HVTN will test your samples to see how your immune system responds 
to the study products . 
We will send your samples (without your name) to labs approved by the HVTN 
for this study. In rare cases, some of your samples may be sent to labs approved 
by the HVTN in other countries for resear ch related to this study.  
HVTN 122  Version 1.0  / September 27, 2017  
HVTN122_v1.0_FINAL  / Page 87 of 109 Researchers may also do genetic testing related to this study on your samples. 
Your genes are passed to you from your birth parents. They affect how you look 
and how your body works. The differences in people’s genes can help expl ain 
why some people get a disease while others do not. The genetic testing will only  
involve some of your genes, not all of your genes (your genome). The researchers 
will study only the genes related to the immune system and HIV and those that 
affect how p eople get HIV.  
If you become HIV infected, the researchers may look at all of the genes of the 
virus found in your samples. The researchers will use this information to learn 
more about HIV and the study product(s).  
In some cases, researchers may take ce lls from your samples and grow more of 
them over time, so that they can continue to contribute to this study.  
These tests done on your samples are for research purposes only , not to check 
your health . The labs will not give the results to you or this clin ic because these 
tests are not approved for use in making healthcare decisions. These labs are only 
approved to do research tests . 
When your samples are no longer needed for this study, the HVTN will continue 
to store them.  
Site: Delete next section if usi ng separate consent for use of samples and information 
in other studies  
16. When samples are no longer needed for this study, the HVTN wants to keep 
them for use in other studies  and share them with other researchers .  
The HVTN calls these samples “extra sampl es”. The HVTN will only allow your 
extra samples to be used in others studies if you agree to this. You will mark your 
decision at the end of this form. If you have any questions, please ask.  
Do I have to agree? No. You are free to say yes or no, or to change your mind 
after you sign this form. At your request, we will destroy all extra samples that we 
have. Your decision will not affect your being in this study or have any negative 
consequences here.   
Where are the samples stored?  Extra samples are stor ed in a secure central place 
called a repository. Your samples will be stored in the HVTN repository in the 
United States.  
How long will the samples be stored? There is no limit on how long your extra 
samples will be stored. [Site: Revise the previous sent ence to insert limits if your 
regulatory authority imposes them.]  
Will I be paid for the use of my samples? No. Also, a researcher may make a new 
scientific discovery or product based on the use of your samples. If this happens, 
HVTN 122  Version 1.0  / September 27, 2017  
HVTN122_v1.0_FINAL  / Page 88 of 109 there is no plan to share a ny money with you. The researcher is not likely to ever 
know who you are.  
Will I benefit from allowing my samples to be used in other studies? Probably not. 
Results from these other studies are not given to you, this clinic, or your doctor. 
They are not pa rt of your medical record. The studies are only being done for 
research purposes.  
Will the HVTN sell my samples and information? No, but the HVTN may share 
your samples with HVTN or other researchers. Once we share your samples and 
information, we may not be able to get them back.  
How do other researchers get my samples and information? When a researcher 
wants to use your samples and information, their research plan must be approved 
by the HVTN. Also, the researcher’s institutional review board (IRB) or eth ics 
committee (EC) will review their plan. [Site: If review by your institution’s 
IRB/EC/RE is also required, insert a sentence stating this.] IRBs/ECs protect the 
rights and well -being of people in research.  If the research plan is approved, the 
HVTN will  send your samples to the researcher’s location.   
What information is shared with HVTN or other researchers? The samples and 
information will be labeled with a code number. Your name will not be part of the 
information. However, some information that we sh are may be personal, such as 
your race, ethnicity, sex, health information from the study, and HIV status. We 
may share information about the study product you received and how your body 
responded to the study product.  
What kind of studies might be done w ith my extra samples and information? The 
studies will be related to HIV, vaccines, the immune system and other diseases.  
Researchers may also do genetic testing on your samples.  
In some cases, researchers may take cells from your samples and grow more o f 
them over time, so that they can continue to contribute to this study.   
If you agree, your samples could also be used for genome wide studies. In these 
studies, researchers will look at all of your genes (your genome). The researchers 
compare the genomes  of many people, looking for common patterns of genes that 
could help them understand diseases. The researchers may put the information 
from the genome -wide studies into a protected database so that other researchers 
can access it. Usually, no one would be  able to look at your genome and link it to 
you as a person. However, if another database exists that also has information on 
your genome and your name, someone might be able to compare the databases 
and identify you. If others found out, it could lead to discrimination or other 
problems. The risk of this is very small.  
Who will have access to my information in studies using my extra samples?  
People who may see your information are:  
HVTN 122  Version 1.0  / September 27, 2017  
HVTN122_v1.0_FINAL  / Page 89 of 109  Researchers who use your extra samples and information for other research  
 Government agencies that fund or monitor the research using your extra 
samples and information  
 The researcher’s Institutional Review Board or Ethics Committee  
 The people who work with the researcher  
All of these people will do their best to protect your information. The results of 
any new studies that use your extra samples and information may be published. 
No publication will use your name or identify you personally.  
17. We will do our best to protect yo ur private information.  
US sites: Check HIPAA authorization for conflicts with this section.  
Your study records and samples will be kept in a secure location. We will label all 
of your samples and most of your records with a code number, not your name or 
other personal information. However, it is possible to identify you, if necessary. 
We will not share your name with the lab that does the tests on your samples, or 
with anyone else who does not need to know your name.  
Site: Any change to the following boxed  text requires approval from HVTN 
Regulatory Affairs.   
We do need to share your name with the HVTN in case you need proof in the 
future that you participated in an HIV vaccine study. The HVTN will keep your 
name in a secure file with these items:  
 The name  of your study  
 Your age or date of birth  
 Your study ID number  
 What study product(s) you received  
There are no HIV test results kept in this file. The HVTN will not share any 
information that could identify you without your agreement. The HVTN will 
remove your name from the file if you do not want it there.  
Clinic staff will have access to your study records. Your records may also be 
reviewed by groups who watch over this study to see that we are protecting your 
rights, keeping you safe, and followin g the study plan. These groups include:  
 The US National Institutes of Health and its study monitors,

21. There are other risks to being in this study.  
This section describes the other risks and restrictions we know about. There may 
also be unknown risks, even serious ones. We will tell you if we learn anything 
new that may affect your willingness to stay in the study.  
Risks of routine medical procedures:  
In this study, we will do some routine medical procedures. These are taking blood 
and giving injections. These procedures can cause bruising, pain, fainting, 
soreness, redness, swelling, itching, a sore, bleeding, and (rarely) muscle damage 
HVTN 122  Versio n 1.0  / September 27, 2017  
HVTN122_v1.0_FINAL  / Page 92 of 109 or infection wh ere you got the injection. Taking blood can cause a low blood cell 
count (anemia), making you feel tired.  
Personal problems/discrimination/testing HIV antibody positive:  
About 10 to 20% of people who join HVTN studies report personal problems or 
discrimina tion because of joining an HIV vaccine study. Family or friends may 
worry, get upset or angry, or assume that you are infected with HIV or at high risk 
and treat you unfairly as a result. Rarely, a person has lost a job because the study 
took too much time  away from work, or because their employer thought they had 
HIV.  
The body makes antibodies to fight or prevent infection. Most vaccines cause the 
body to make antibodies as a way of preventing infection. Your body may make 
antibodies to HIV because you re ceived an HIV study vaccine. The study vaccine 
may cause you to test positive on some types of HIV antibody tests, even if you 
are not infected with HIV. This is called vaccine -induced seropositivity (VISP). 
VISP means that after you get the study vaccine,  a routine HIV test done outside 
this clinic may say you have HIV, even if you don’t. For this reason, you should 
plan to get HIV tests only at this clinic during the study. Our tests can tell the 
difference between true HIV infection and a positive result  that is caused by the 
study vaccine.  
If you have a positive test result caused by the study vaccine at any time, we can 
arrange free HIV testing for as long as you need it. If this happens, we do not 
know how long you will test positive due to the study v accine. If you receive a 
positive HIV test result and we determine it is because you have HIV, we will 
refer you for follow -up care.  
It is unlikely, but you could test negative at the end of the study and positive some 
time later, even though you don’t hav e HIV. This could happen if different HIV 
tests come into use. We will give you a phone number to call for more 
information.  
Site: Modify the following paragraph if applicable.  If someone believes you are 
infected with HIV even if you are not, you could f ace discrimination and other 
problems. For example, in some countries, you could be denied medical or dental 
care, employment, insurance, a visa, or entry into the military. If you do have a 
positive HIV antibody test caused by the study vaccine, you will not be able to 
donate blood or organs. Your family and friends may treat you differently. We 
will give you a brochure that tells you more about testing HIV positive because of 
an HIV vaccine, and how you can avoid some of these problems.  
If you become preg nant during or after the study and have VISP, we don't know if 
the antibodies could be passed to your baby. We know that this happens with 
other vaccines, like tetanus vaccine. These antibodies from the mother are not a 
danger to the baby, and they go away  over time. For most babies antibodies from 
the mother last for about  6 months.  
HVTN 122  Version 1.0  / September 27, 2017  
HVTN122_v1.0_FINAL  / Page 93 of 109 You should always tell the delivery staff if you have VISP. However, you may 
still be tested for HIV using the antibody test when you deliver your baby. If your 
test is positiv e and the delivery staff believes you have an HIV infection, your 
baby may be started on antiretroviral treatment when it is not needed. If this 
happens, we can arrange for you and the baby to have a test that can tell the 
difference between true HIV infec tion and a VISP result. If you or the baby 
continue to have VISP, we can arrange this testing for free for as long as it is 
needed.  
Embarrassment/anxiety:  
You may feel embarrassed when we ask about your HIV risks, such as having sex 
and using drugs. Also,  waiting for your HIV test results or other health test results 
could make you feel anxious. You could feel worried if your test results show that 
you are infected with HIV. If you feel embarrassed or anxious, please tell us and 
we will try to help you.  
Risks of disclosure of your personal information:  
We will take several steps to protect your personal information. Although the risk 
is very low, it is possible that your personal information could be given to 
someone who should not have it. If that happened , you could face discrimination, 
stress, and embarrassment. We can tell you more about how we will protect your 
personal information if you would like it.  
Risks of genetic testing:  
It is unlikely, but the genetic test s done on your samples could show you may be 
at risk for certain diseases. If others found out, it could lead to discrimination or 
other problems. However, it is almost impossible for you or others to know your 
test results from the genetic testing. The results are not part of your study recor ds 
and are not given to you.  
In the very unlikely event that your genetic information becomes linked to your 
name, a federal law called the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act 
(GINA) helps protect you.  GINA keeps health insurance companies and 
emplo yers from seeing results of genetic testing when deciding about giving you 
health insurance or offering you work. GINA does not help or protect you against 
discrimination by companies that sell life, disability, or long -term care insurance.  
Unknown risks:  
We do not know if the study vaccine will increase, decrease, or not change your 
risk of becoming infected with HIV if exposed. If you get infected with HIV, we 
do not know how the study vaccine might affect your HIV infection or how long 
it takes to devel op AIDS.  
We do not know if getting this study vaccine will affect how you respond to any 
future approved HIV vaccine. It could be that a future HIV vaccine may not work 
HVTN 122  Version 1.0  / September 27, 2017  
HVTN122_v1.0_FINAL  / Page 94 of 109 as well for you because you got the study vaccine. Currently, no HIV vaccine has 
been a pproved for use.  
We do not know how the study vaccine will affect a pregnant participant or a 
developing baby.  
Benefits  
22. The study may not benefit you.  
We do not know whether getting the study vaccine might benefit you in any way. 
However, being in the st udy might still help you in some ways. The counseling 
that you get as part of the study may help you avoid getting HIV. The lab tests 
and physical exams that you get while in this study might detect health problems 
you don’t yet know about.  
This study may  help in the search for a vaccine to prevent HIV. However, if the 
study vaccine later become approved and sold, there are no plans to share any 
money with you .  
Your rights and responsibilities  
23. If you join the study, you have rights and responsibilities.  
You have many rights that we will respect. You also have responsibilities. We list 
these in the Participant’s Bill of Rights and Responsibilities. We will give you a 
copy of it.  
Leaving the study  
24. Tell us if you decide to leave the study.  
You are free to l eave the study at any time and for any reason. Your care at this 
clinic and your legal rights will not be affected, but it is important for you to let us 
know.  
We will ask you to come back to the clinic one last time for a physical exam, and 
we may ask to  take some blood and urine samples.  We will also ask about any 
personal problems or benefits you have experienced from being in the study. We 
believe these steps are important to protecting your health, but it is up to you 
whether to complete them.  
Injurie s 
Site: Approval from  HVTN Regulatory Affairs (at vtn.core.reg@hvtn.org ) is needed 
for any change (other than those that the instructions specifically request or those 
previously approved by HVTN Regulatory Affairs) to the boxed text . 
HVTN 1 22 Version 1.0  / September 27, 2017  
HVTN122_v1.0_FINAL  / Page 95 of 109 25. If you get sick or in jured during the study, contact us immediately.  
Your health is important to us. (Site: adjust the following 2 sentences if applicable 
to the care available at your site)  We will tell you about the care that we can give 
here. For the care that we cannot provide, we will explain how we will help you 
get care elsewhere.  
If you become sick or injured in this study, there is a process to decide if it is 
related to the study vaccine or the adjuvant and/or procedures. If it is, we call it a 
study -related injury . There are funds to pay for treatment of study -related injuries 
if certain conditions are met.  
The HVTN has limited funds to pay medical costs that it determines are 
reasonable.  (Site: insert locale -appropriate medical insurance language in the 
following  sentence)  If the injury is not study related, then you and your health 
insurance will be responsible for treatment costs.  
Some injuries are not physical. For example, you might be harmed emotionally by 
being in an HIV vaccine study. Or you might lose wag es because you cannot go 
to work. However, there are no funds to pay for these kinds of injuries, even if 
they are study related.  
You may disagree with the decision about whether your injury is study related. If 
you wish, the HVTN will ask independent expe rts to review the decision. You 
always have the right to use the court system if you are not satisfied.

HVTN122_v1.0_FINAL  / Page 98 of 109 Appendix B  Approved birth control methods (for sample 
informed consent form)  
Site: Any change to the following boxed text requires approval from HVTN 
Regulatory Affairs at vtn.core.reg@hvtn.org.  
You should not become pregnant during the study because we do not know how 
the study vaccine  could affect the developing baby.  
You must agree to use effective birth control from 21 days  before your  first 
injection  until 6  months  after your last study injection.   
Effective birth control means using any of the following methods every time you 
have sex:  
 Birth control drugs that prevent pregnancy —given by pills, shots, patches, 
vaginal rings, or inserts under the  skin;  
 Male or female condoms, with or without a cream or gel that kills sperm;  
 Diaphragm or cervical cap with a cream or gel that kills sperm;  
 Intrauterine device (IUD); or  
 Any other contraceptive method approved by the researchers.  
You do not have to use  birth control if:  
 You are only having sex with a partner or partners who have had a vasectomy. 
(We will ask you some questions to confirm that the vasectomy was 
successful.);  
 You have reached menopause, with no menstrual periods for one year;  
 You have had  a hysterectomy (your uterus removed);  
 You have had your ovaries removed;  
 You have a tubal ligation (your “tubes tied”) or confirmed successful 
placement of a product that blocks the fallopian tubes;  
 You are having sex only with a female partner or partner s; 
 You only have oral sex; or,  
 You are sexually abstinent (no sex at all).  
HVTN 122  Version 1.0  / September 27, 2017  
HVTN122_v1.0_FINAL  / Page 99 of 109 Remember: If you are having sex, you need to use male or female condoms to 
protect yourself from HIV infection.  
If you join the study, we will test you for pregnancy at some visits,  including 
before each study injection .

information in other studies  
Title: A phase 1 double -blind, randomized clinical trial to evaluate the safety and 
immunogenicity of a recombinant oligomeric gp145 clade C Env  protein (g p145 
C.6980) in healthy, HIV -1–uninfected adult participants in the US  
HVTN protocol number: HVTN 122  
Site: [Insert site name]  
When samples are no longer needed for this study, the HVTN wants to use them 
in other studies  and share them with other researchers .  
The HVTN calls these samples extra samples” . The HVTN will only allow your 
extra samples to be used in other studies if you agree to this. You will mark your 
decision at the end of this form. If you have any questio ns, please ask.  
1. Do I have to agree?  
No. You are free to say yes or no, or to change your mind after you sign this form . 
At your request, we will destroy all extra samples that we have. Your decision 
will not affect your being in this study or have any ne gative consequences here.   
2. Where are the samples stored?  
Extra samples are stored in a secure central place called a repository.  Your 
samples will be stored in the HVTN repository in the United States.  
3. How long will the samples be stored?  
There is no lim it on how long your extra samples will be stored.  [Site:  Revise the 
previous sentence to  insert limits if your regulatory authority imposes them.]  
4. Will I be paid for the use of my samples?  
No. Also, a researcher may make a new scientific discovery or prod uct based on 
the use of your samples. If this happens, there is no plan to share any money with 
you. The researcher is not likely to ever know who you are.  
5. Will I benefit from allowing my samples to be used in other studies?  
Probably not. Results from the se other studies are not given to you, this clinic, or 
your doctor. They are not part of your medical record. The studies are only being 
done for research purposes.  
6. Will the HVTN sell my samples and information?  
No, but the HVTN may share your samples wit h other researchers. Once we share 
your samples  and information , we may not be able to get them back.  
HVTN 122  Version 1.0  / September 27, 2017  
HVTN122_v1.0_FINAL  / Page 101 of 109 7. How do other researchers get my samples and information?  
When a researcher wants to use your samples and/or information, their research 
plan must be approved by the HVTN. Also, the researcher’s institutional review 
board (IRB) or ethics committee (EC) will review their plan. [Site: If review by 
your institution’ s IRB/EC/RE is also required, insert a sentence stating this.]  
IRBs/ECs protect the rights and well -being of people in research. If the research 
plan is approved, the HVTN will send your samples to the researcher’s location.  
8. What information is shared with  HVTN or other researchers?  
The samples and information will be labeled with a code number. Your name will 
not be part of the information. However, some information that we share may be 
personal, such as your race, ethnicity, gender, health information fr om the study, 
and HIV status. We may share information about the study product you received 
and how your body responded to the study product.  
9. What kind of studies might be done with my extra samples and information?  
The studies will be related to HIV, va ccines, the immune system and other 
diseases.  
Researchers may also do genetic testing on your samples.  
In some cases, researchers may take cells from your samples and grow more of 
them over time, so that they can continue to contribute to this study.  
If you agree, your samples could also be used for genome wide studies. In these 
studies, researchers will look at all of your genes (your genome). The researchers 
compare the genomes of many people, looking for common patterns of genes that 
could help them un derstand diseases. The researchers may put the information 
from the genome -wide studies into a protected database so that other researchers 
can access it. Usually, no one would be able to look at your genome and link it to 
you as a person. However, if anot her database exists that also has information on 
your genome and your name, someone might be able to compare the databases 
and identify you. If others found out, it could lead to discrimination or other 
problems. The risk of this is very small.  
10. What are th e risks of genetic testing?  
It is unlikely, but t he genetic test s done on your samples  could show you may be 
at risk for certain diseases. If others found out, it could lead to discrimination or 
other problems. However, it is almost impossible for you or others to know your 
test results from the genetic testing. The results are not part of your study records 
and are not given to you.   
In the very unlikely event that your genetic information becomes linked to your 
name, a federal law called the Genetic Info rmation Nondiscrimination Act 
(GINA) helps protect you.  GINA keeps health insurance companies and 
HVTN 122  Version 1.0  / September 27, 2017  
HVTN122_v1.0_FINAL  / Page 102 of 109 employers from seeing results of genetic testing when deciding about giving you 
health insurance or offering you work. GINA does not help or protect you again st 
discrimination by companies that sell life, disability , or long -term care insurance.   
11. Who will have access to my information in studies using my extra samples?  
People who may see your information are:  
 Researchers who use your stored samples and limited information for other 
research  
 Government agencies that fund or monitor the research using your samples or 
information  
 The researcher’s Institutional Review Board or Ethics Committee  
 The people who work with the researcher  
All of these people will do thei r best to protect your information. The results of 
any new studies that use your extra samples or information may be published. No 
publication will use your name or identify you personally.  
Questions   
12. If you have questions or problems about allowing your s amples and 
information to be used in other studies, use the following important contacts.  
If you have questions about the use of your samples or information or if you want 
to change your mind about their use, contact

3 Screening may occur over the course of several contacts/visits up to and including day 0 prior to vaccination.  
4 Local labs may assign appropriate alternative tube types for locally performed tests.  
5 Chemistry panels are defined in Section 9.2 (pre -enrollment) and Section 9.3 (postenrollment).   
6 Immunogenicity assays will be performed at M0 and M0.5 (for binding Ab assay) and M6.5. Based on the number of responders observed at these timepoints, lab a ssays may be 
performed on participants for humoral and cellular responses at other timepoints  
7 Genotyping may be performed on enrolled participants using cryopreserved PBMC collected at baseline, initially in participant s who demonstrate vaccine -induced T -cell 
responses at postvaccination timepoints.  
8 For a participant who was born female, pregnancy test must be performed on the day of vaccination with negative results recei ved prior to vaccination. Persons who are NOT of 
reproductive potential due to hav ing undergone total hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy (verified by medical records), are not required to undergo pregnan cy testing.  
9 At an early termination visit for a withdrawn or terminated participant (see Section  9.10), blood should be drawn for HIV diagnostic testing, as shown for visit 11 above.  
10 And microscopy if needed.  
y = SST blood collected for serum storage will also cover spec imen needs for the Vaccinia neutralizing Ab assay; no separate blood draw is needed.  
z = ACD blood collected for PBMC storage will also cover specimen needs for the pTfh , pTfr,  and plasmablasts assay; no separate blood draw is needed.

4 Pregnancy prevention assessment is required only for participants who  were born female and are capable of becoming pregnant.  
5 Includes pre -test counseling. A subsequent follow -up contact is conducted to provide post -test counseling and to report results to participant.  
6 For a participant who was born female, pregnancy tes t must be performed on urine or blood specimens within 24 hours of vaccination with negative results 
received prior to vaccination. Pregnancy test to determine initial eligibility may be performed at screening, but must also b e done on day 0 prior to first  
vaccination. Persons who are NOT of reproductive potential due to having undergone total hysterectomy or bilateral oophorecto my (verified by medical records), 
are not required to undergo pregnancy testing. Serum pregnancy tests may be used to confirm the results of, or substitute for, a urine pregnancy test.  
7 Blood draws required at vaccination visits must be performed prior to administration of study product; however, it is not nec essary to have results prior to 
administration, except for results of a se rum pregnancy test, if indicated. Lab tests may be drawn within the 3 days prior to vaccination.  
8 Reactogenicity assessments performed daily for at least 7 days postvaccination (see Section  9.8).

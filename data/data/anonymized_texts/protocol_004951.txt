Study Title  
Virtual Training for Latino Caregivers to Manage Symptoms of Dementia  
Objectives  
The objectives of this study are to: (1) culturally and linguistically adapt the STAR -VTF 
online training  modules  for Latino caregivers of people living with dementia (PLWD), 
(2) pilot test Latino caregivers’ responses to the adapted online training  modules, an d (3) 
develop a REDCap survey to pragmatically collected caregiver outcomes  in a future 
study . 
Design and Outcomes   
The study will use a single -arm pilot trial design  with Latino caregivers of PLWD. We 
will assess self -reported outcomes  at baseline and  6-8 weeks post -enrollment using a 
REDCap survey . Outcome measures will include the Revised Memory and Problem 
Behavior Checklist and Preparedness for Caregiving Scale. In addition, we will assess 
caregivers’ perceived usability  of the online training modules, and we will conduct 
 
Protocol Template, Version 5.0 v qualitative interviews 6 -8 weeks post -enrollment.  The interviews will assess c aregiver 
satisfaction with and acceptability of the adapted online training  modules . 
Interventions and Duration  
For 6 -8 weeks, caregivers will complete online training modules asynchronously. They 
will access the modules via email or text message . There are 7 online training  modules. 
Caregivers will be instructed to complete one module per week. The content of the 
modules is as follows:  Module 1  provides an understanding and overview of dementia ; 
Module 2 introduces caregivers to the behavioral treatment of dementia, realistic 
expectations, and effective communication; Module 3 covers the ABC (antecedents, 
behaviors, consequences) approach to problem -solving, including rationale and 
development of an ABC plan; Module 4 instructs caregivers to review the ABC plan and 
revise as needed; Module 5 covers pleasant events and managing negative thinking; 
Module 6 instructs caregivers to review the ABC plan, pleasant activities schedule, and to 
revise as needed; Mod ule 7 covers coping with caregiving and maintaining gains. Each 
module takes about 15 minutes to complete. The modules use text, pictures, and 
illustrations with a voiceover presentation.  Caregivers will receive the online training  
modules in their preferred language (English or Spanish).  They will also receive a 
workbook to accompany the lesssons . The total length of time each caregiver  will be in 
the study is approximately 8 weeks.  
Sample Size and Population  
Participants will: be aged 18 years or older, live with PLWD  or within 5 miles, provide at 
least 8 hours of care per week, provide care to PLWD  who lives at home, and self -
identify as Hispanic/Latino.  We expect to enroll up to 20 participants. The primary 
objective of  this study is to pilot test the adapted online training  modules . Therefore, it is  
not powered to detect an effect of the intervention.

2 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE   
2.1 Background on Condition, Disease, or Other Primary Study Focus  
Latinos are more likely to develop Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias 
(ADRD ). Driven by the growing population of older Latino adults in the U.S., the number 
of Latino PLWD is projected to increase more than nine fold from 379,000 in 2012 to 3.5 
million by 2060.1 Older Latino adults have a higher incidence and prevalence of ADRD 
compared to older White adults.2 These differences are due in large part to the health 
conditions (e.g., diabetes) and socioeconomic factors (e.g., chronic exposure to economic 
and social adversity, lower levels and quality of education, and discrimination) that are 
more prevalent in Lat ino populations and that are associated with cognitive decline.3,4 
Despite Latinos being 1.5 times more likely to develop ADRD than White adults,2  there is 
currently a lack of culturally -competent, accessible, and scalable interventions for Latino 
families.  
Latino PLWD have a higher prevalence of  behavioral and psychological symptoms of 
dementia  (BPSD ) and their caregivers have a higher risk of depression, yet they 
remain underrepresented in research . Among community -dwelling PLWD, the 
prevalence of BPSD is higher among Latinos compared to White people, even after 
adjusting for age, gender, education, income, cognitive and functional status, and caregiver 
characteristics.5 Prevalence of behavior problems in older adults is positively associated 
with caregiver burden and depression.6 Furthermore, behavior problems play a larger role 
in predicting caregiver burden and depression than do the physical and cognitive 
impairments of older adults, hours per week providing care, number of care tasks, and 
duration in the caregiver role. Latino  caregivers of PLWD are at higher risk for and have 
higher levels of depression compared to White caregivers.7–11 Despite these disparities, 
Latinos are continually underrepresented in dementia research. Dozens of interventions for 
managing BPSD in PLWD and for improving the well -being of their caregivers have been 
developed and tested in the U.S.12 However, these interventions have been tested 
predominantly with White caregivers. To address ethnic disparities in health and research, 
a pragmatic trial design must include the recruitment of Latino caregivers of PLWD.  
 
Protocol Template, Version 5.0 4 Latinos experience worse quality of care and discrimination when accessing ADRD 
care.  Compared to White people, Latinos are less satisfied in their communication with 
healthcare providers, are more likely to perceive that providers fail to provide needed 
information, and are more likely to report having a problem understanding healthcare 
providers.13–15 Spanish -speaking Latinos report much worse experiences with healthcare 
than White people.13,15 –17 In a national survey, nearly 60% of Latino caregivers of PLWD 
report having faced discrimination when navigating healthcare settings for PLWD.18 For 
85% of Latino caregivers in the survey, it was important that healthcare providers treating 
ADRD understand their ethnic background, but less than 60% felt confident about having 
access to culturally -competent healthcare. Our preliminary work indicate s that providers 
miss opportunities to identify Latino caregivers that need supportive services for managing 
BPSD. Barriers include caregiver -provider language discordance and differences in 
communication styles, particularly as it relates to the topic of BPSD. For this reason, 
culturally and linguistically adapting evidence -based interventions, like STAR -VTF, is a 
critical aspect in the design of pragmatic trials.  
Latino caregivers face barriers in seeking ADRD healthcare . Like other minority 
caregivers of PLWD, Latinos tend to attribute memory loss to normal aging, normalize 
behavioral and psychological symptoms, and hide problems with symptoms to avoid 
stigmatization of their family member.19 This stems from the lack of culturally - and 
linguistically -competent information about dementia that is available in these communities, 
rather than from culturally -influenced beliefs. The normalization of symptoms and the 
stigmatization of the disease is a major barrier to seeking ADRD healthcare. Other major 
barriers for Latino caregivers include clinicians’ lack of knowledge about the differences 
between normal aging and early signs of dementia, lack of Spanish -speaking clinicians, and 
experience of disc rimination in healthcare settings.18–20 Our preliminary work indicates that 
Latino caregivers hesitate to raise concerns about BPSD with healthcare providers due to 
language discordance and health literacy factors. Interventions such as STAR -VTF 
embedded in healthcare systems can help to raise L atino caregivers’ awareness about the 
availability of culturally -competent, nonpharmacological treatments for improving 
management of BPSD at home.  
STAR -VTF is an evidence -based virtual intervention to support caregivers in 
managing BPSD . STAR -C Virtual Training and Follow -up (STAR -VTF) is a virtual 
adaptation of a systematic and standardized behavioral approach – known as the Seattle 
Protocols – to training caregivers to reduce BPSD in community -dwelling PLWD. The 
Seattle Protocols teach caregivers the ABCs of behavior change – a process that involves 
identifying specifics about the problem under consideration, identifying possible 
environmental or in terpersonal factors that lead up to and sustain their occurrence, and 
systematically altering those factors to reduce problems.21 The Seattle Protocols were 
consolidated into the STAR -C program wherein coaches (master’s degree or equivalent in 
 
Protocol Template, Version 5.0 5 psychology, social work, or a related field) visit caregivers at home to deliver the training.22 
The condensed 6 -week program involves 4 in -home sessions and 2 telephone sessions.23,24 
A randomized controlled trial was conducted to compare STAR -C to routine medical care 
in English -speaking, predominantly White participants.23 The study population included 
only 1 Latino caregiver (randomized to control arm). At 6 months, caregivers randomized 
to the intervention arm had significantly lower depression, subjective burden, and caregiver 
reaction scores.  
To ease translation, STAR -VTF was developed and is now being tested in a pragmatic trial 
at Kaiser Permanente Washington (KPWA).25,26 STAR -VTF delivers the same content as 
STAR -C but in an entirely virtual environment.26 For 6 -8 weeks, caregivers complete 6 
online training modules asynchronously and have 6 30 -minute weekly telephone check -ins 
with a coach (social worker or mental health counselor). The 6 modules cover the same 
content as STAR -C (Table 1). The modules are hosted on the Kaiser Permanente School of 
Allied Health Scienc es learning management system. Currently, only caregivers 
participating in the ongoing pragmatic trial at KPWA have access to this website. O ur 
preliminary data identified potential areas of mis fit between STAR -VTF and Latino 
caregivers. The modules: do not sufficiently address dementia literacy, use 
language/semantics that could be insensitive, and do not reflect Latino cultural values that 
could influence family structures and views of caregivi ng.

2.2 Study Rationale  
We conducted qualitative interviews with 44 stakeholders (e.g., Latino caregivers, 
frontline clinicians, and health educators). The stakeholders were not involved in the 
ongoing STAR -VTF pragmatic trial at KPWA and only viewed prototypes of the 
modules. Our analysis re vealed that healthcare systems are not providing adequate 
education about dementia and support in managing BPSD. In fact, most Latino caregivers 
were unaware that healthcare providers could help with this matter. Stakeholders 
expressed interest in STAR -VTF , but there were concerns with particular aspects of the 
modules. Based on feedback from stakeholders, we have identified three adaptations to 
the STAR -VTF modules that would better serve Latino caregivers.  
Increase knowledge about dementia to reduce normalization of symptoms and 
stigmatization of PLWD.  Similar to other studies of racial and ethnic minority 
caregivers, our preliminary data reveal that Latinos tend to: believe dementia is a normal 
part of aging; attribute behavioral and psychological symptoms to normal aging or to 
their family member’s pe rsonality; attribute the development of dementia to emotions; 
believe that dementia is a mental health disorder, and therefore, perceive PLWD as being 
loco (crazy); view pharmacological treatment of BPSD as accepting that their family 
member is loco (crazy); and believe that dementia can be healed or its symptoms 
managed through herbal remedies, praying, and therapy.  
Module 1 includes a 7 -minute section titled “Overview of Dementia.” It covers the links 
between dementia and behavior, common causes of dementia, how dementia affects a 
person’s ability to do daily tasks, and how changes in behavior are progressive and not  
intentional. The first adaptation of our proposed study will be to expand the content in 
this section. The goal is to reduce normalization of BPSD and the stigma associated with 
ADRD. For example, when discussing common causes of dementia, we will add con tent 
about the differences between normal age -related forgetfulness and serious memory 
problems. We will also explain that dementia is a physical (not mental) illness.  
 
Eliminate stigmatizing, offensive, and culturally irrelevant language.  We found that 
Latinos tend to prefer the term pérdida de la memoria  (memory loss) instead of  
“Alzheimer’s disease” or “dementia .” Furthermore, stakeholders were concerned with 
program materials describing behavior symptoms as “challenging,” “problematic,” and 
“bothersome.” It could be misinterpreted as describing PLWD (as opposed to their 
symptoms). In addition, stakeholders expla ined that Latinos tend to place the needs of the 
person they are caring for over their own needs. It is a way of expressing the Latino 
cultural value of familismo  (familism). Thus, stakeholders st rongly advised against 
program materials describing caregiving as burdensome. Finally, Latinos rarely identified 
with the label “caregiver.” The translated word ( cuidador ) does not appear to be 
commonly -used. It is sometimes misinterpreted to refer to a formal caregiver or to an 
informal/family caregiver who gets paid to provide care. Latino caregivers we 
interviewed preferred to simply use kinship terms (e.g., daughter, daughter -in-law, wife 
of person with memory loss) to describe their role.  
 
 
Protocol Template, Version 5.0 7 Based on these findings, the second adaptation of our proposed study will be to revise the 
language used across all modules. The goal is to eliminate any language that could be 
stigmatizing, offensive, and culturally irrelevant. For example, we will replac e 
“dementia ” with “memory loss,” eliminate negative descriptions of BPSD, avoid the term 
“caregiver burden,” and replace the label “caregiver” with kinship terms.  
 
Incorporate Latino family structure and the nature of caregiving in Latino families . 
Stakeholders stressed the importance of targeting the family unit, as opposed to a primary 
caregiver, in ADRD healthcare for Latinos. A bilingual and bicultural social worker said, 
“It's not necessarily just one person [caring for PLWD]. Because our famili es come in 
packs… I think being able to be flexible in some of the norms that an education program 
will have, whether that means two people or more -- because usually, it' s a family.” In the 
vast majority of cases, Latino caregivers we interviewed described receiving extensive 
support from family members (including small children). They lived in multigenerational 
households or within close proximity of relatives, facilitati ng frequent help with care 
responsibilities and emotional support. In addition, there was a strong aversion to using 
formal respite services, driven by cultural, language, and economic factors.  
 
In module 7, caregivers learn that enlisting the help of family members and formal respite 
care providers could help them better cope with caregiving. It assumes most caregivers 
live alone with PLWD and that other family members provide minimal support. The third 
adaptation of our proposed study is to incorporate content that reflects the structure of 
Latino families (i.e., multigenerational households, liv ing near family) and how 
caregiving is often a shared responsibility within the family unit. Furthermore, when 
suggesting use of formal respite care services, we will be sensitive to culturally -
influenced preferences. We will also address concerns about th e lack of bilingual, 
bicultural, and affordable services.  
 
Intervention Regimen:  For 6 -8 weeks, caregivers will complete  the 7 online training 
modules asynchronously. They will access the video modules sent to them through text 
message  or email . As described in Table 2, the content of the modules includes an 
overview of dementia, realistic expectations, effective communication, using the ABC 
approach to problem -solve BPSD, and planning pleasant events. Each module takes 
about 15 minutes to complete. The modules use text, pictures, and illustrations with a 
voiceover presentation. They will also receive a printed workbook to go along with  the 
lessons. While the STAR -VTF  intervention  incorporates a  coaching component, the 
present  study will only pil ot test the adapted online training modules . The full STAR -
VTF intervention – adapted modules coupled with coaching – will be tested in a future 
study with Latino caregivers.  
 
3 STUDY DESIGN  
Objective  1: Culturally and linguistically adapt the STAR -VTF online training  
modules for Latino caregivers of PLWD  
Findings from our stakeholder interviews indicate that no major changes to the 
intervention’s core components are required. Instead, we need to improve the content and 
 
Protocol Template, Version 5.0 8 language used in the  online training  modules. Th e first adaptation  will be  to expand the 
content in the “Overview of Dementia” section of module 1. The content will address 
common beliefs and attitudes about dementia that result in families normalizing dementia 
symptoms and stigmatizing PLWD. The second adaptation  will be  to revise the language 
across all modules. We will eliminate any language that stakeholders suggested could be 
stigmatizing, offensive, and culturally irrelevant. We will rewrite the conte nt to a 6th 
grade or lower reading level – a suggestion made by frontline clinician and health 
educator stakeholders. The content of the modules will be translated and the voiceover 
presentations recorded in Spanish. The third adaptation  will be  to incorporate content into 
module 7 that reflects the structure of Latino families (e.g., tendency to live 
multigenerational households) and how caregiving can often be a shared responsibility 
within the family unit.  
The PI  will lead this adaptation work  with support from the study’s staff member. 
Feedback on draft adaptations will be obtained from s takeholders, including Latino 
caregivers of PLWD  and Spanish -English bilingual and bicultural health educators . 
These individuals are members of a community advisory board. We will refine 
adaptations based on stakeholder feedback.   
 
Objective 2: Pilot test Latino caregivers’ responses to the adapted online training  
modules  
The study will use a single -arm pilot trial design. Participants will be up to 20 caregivers 
of PLWD . We will target individuals who  are: aged 18 years or older, live with PLWD  or 
within 5 miles, provide at least 8 hours of care per week, provide care to PLWD  who 
lives at home, and self -identify as Hispanic/Latino.  
Caregivers will complete a baseline survey using a REDCap link that will be delivered to 
caregivers via email or text  message . The survey will include sociodemographic 
characteristics and the outcome measures (i.e., Revised Memory and Problem Behavior 
Checklist and Preparedness for Caregiving Scale). We will collect outcome measures 
from caregivers again 6 -8 weeks post -enrollmen t using the same data collection method. 
Sociodemographic characteristics will include: caregiver age, occupational status, 
whether  caregiver works outside of the home, number of people living in caregiver’s 
home, educational attainment, English fluency, preferred language, languages spoken at 
home, race, gender, annual household income, device ownership, Internet access  at home , 
health insurance status of caregiver and PLWD, relationship to PLWD, age of PLWD, 
gender of PLWD, number of years in caregiving role, whether caregiver lives in same 
household as PLWD, and hours per week providing care.  
After completing the baseline survey, caregivers will begin participation in the 
intervention. The intervention tested in this study will only involve the self -directed 
training component of the STAR -VTF intervention . We will provide caregivers with the 
video modules via text messgae or email . We will also mail each participant a copy of  the 
adapted version of the STAR -VTF workbook in their preferred language.  There are 
handouts and resources to along with each  lesson.  Caregivers will be instructed to 
complete 1 module per week for 7 weeks (Table 2). 
 
Protocol Template, Version 5.0 9 After 6 -8 weeks, we will schedule an exit interview with caregivers . The interview will 
happen virtually (phone or videoconferencing) and will be under 1 hour. We will ask 
participants  semi -structured questions to understand their experience with the online 
training  modules and wit h completing the survey  via REDCap . 
 
Objective 3: Develop a REDCap survey to pragmatically collected caregiver 
outcomes . We will create a REDCap survey that will facilitate  collect ion of caregiver 
outcomes pragmatically  in a larger pilot study and full -scale embedded pragmatic clinical 
trial that we plan to conduct in the future . The REDCap instrument will include the 
English and Spanish versions of the Revised Memory and Problem Behavior Checklist 
and the Preparedness for Caregiving Scale . In the future, this functionality will allow 
remote collection of caregiver outcomes that can be securely linked back to the patient 
electronic medical record  – solving the issue with health information management laws  
that make it dif ficult or impossible to collect caregiver outcomes as part of a patient’s 
electronic  medical  record . In the present study, we will pilot the REDCap survey by 
asking caregivers to complete it at baseline and 6 -8 weeks post -enrollment.  
 
4 SELECTION AND ENROLLMENT OF PARTICIPANTS   
4.1 Inclusion  Criteria  
Participants will be eligible if the meet the following criteria:  
• Age 18 years or older  
• Live with PLWD  or within 5 miles  
• Provide at least 8 hours of care per week  
• Self-identify as Hispanic/Latino  
• Caregiver self -report of PLWD having ≥ 3 BPSD occurring ≥ 3 in past week  
 
4.2 Exclusion  Criteria  
Participants will be excluded if : 
• PLWD  lives in assisted living or skilled nursing facilities  
 
4.3 Study Enrollment Procedures  
We will identify potential study participants using a variety of strategies. First, we will 
contact Latino caregivers of PLWD  who receive care at UW Medicine. These individuals 
participated in a previous study led by Dr. Ramirez and agreed to be contacted again for 
participation in future studies. Second, we will distribute recruitment flyers in federally 
qualified health center s and across primary care clinics that are part of the WWAMI 
(Washington, Wyoming, Alaska, Montana and Idaho) region Practice and R esearch 
Network. Next , we will advertise the study in Spanish language media (e.g., radio 
 
Protocol Template, Version 5.0 10 stations and newspapers).  Finally, we will recruit via the Alzheimer’s Prevention 
Registry . 
For caregivers who are interested in study participation, the study staff member s, Celeste 
Garcia  and Lily Zavala , will schedule a phone call to answer any questions they may 
have and screen for eligibility. We will email  or mail the  consent form to caregivers who 
are eligible. After mailing these materials, study staff  will contact caregivers by phone to 
review the consent form and answer any questions. Caregivers will sign the consent form 
electronically or by paper and mail it to staff members . After receiving the signed consent 
form, caregivers will receive an email or text message asking them to complete the online 
baseline survey. Participants who do not sign  the consent form will not be allowed to 
participate in the study. We wi ll use a screening log to document reasons for ineligibility 
and for non -participation of eligible candidates.  
 
 
5 STUDY INTERVENTIONS   
5.1 Interventions, Administration, and Duration  
For 6 -8 weeks, caregivers will complete  the 7 online training modules asynchronously. 
As described in Table 2, the content of the modules includes an overview of dementia, 
realistic expectations, effective communication, using the ABC approach to problem -
solve BPSD, and planning pleasant events. Each module takes about 15 minutes to 
complete.  We will instruct caregivers to complete one module per week.  The modules 
use text, pictures, and illustrations with a voiceover presentation. The modules also 
include a n adapted  workbook with for participants to complete . While the STAR -VTF  
intervention  incorporates a  coaching component, the present  study will only pilot test 
the adapted online training modules . The full STAR -VTF intervention – adapted 
modules coupled with coaching – will be tested in a future study with Latino caregivers.  
We believe there is minimal risk associated with participating in the study. The 
intervention is an education and training program to give caregivers more tools and better 
knowledge for minimizing and responding to BPSD . The primary risk  with the 
intervention is discomfort with the intervention content. The intervention’s  
recommendations based on the best available clinical evidence and has already been 
extensively tested in prior research. Core elements of the intervention have been proven 
in previous rese arch to significantly improve average clinical outcomes. Nevertheless, 
treatment recommendations that improve care on average may have adverse 
consequences for any individual patient. Participants will be fully informed of the risks 
and their right to decl ine or withdraw from the study or specific activities.  
 
5.2 Handling of Study Interventions  
From  home, caregivers  will access the  asynchronous, self -directed  modules via a website 
hosted on the Kaiser Permanente School of Allied Health Sciences learning management 
system. Caregivers will log in to the website from their preferred web browser using an 
email address and user -generated password.   
 
Protocol Template, Version 5.0 11  
5.3 Concomitant Interventions  
The intervention is an adjunct to usual care. No services that are usually available to 
PLWD  or their family caregivers will be withheld.  
 
5.4 Adherence Assessment  
Caregiver adherence data will be captured automatically via the Kaiser Permanente 
School of Allied Health Sciences learning management system. There are built -in metrics 
that track how users interact with the website, which we will utilize to determine 
caregiver completion rates for each module.  We will use descriptive statistics to 
characterize caregiver adherence to completing the modules.

Protocol Template, Version 5.0 13 6.2 Description of Evaluations  
6.2.1 Screening Assessment  
For caregivers who are interested in study participation, the study staff member s will 
schedule a phone call to answer any questions they may have and screen for 
eligibility. Study staff  will use a structured screening survey to ask potential 
participants their age, whether they live with PLWD  or within 5 miles , the number of 
hours of care they provide each week , their race/ethnicity, and whether PLWD  lives 
in assisted living or skilled nursing facilities .  
We will email a n e-consent form to caregivers who are eligible. After emailing these 
materials, study staff  will contact caregivers by phone  again  to review the e-consent 
form and answer any questions.  Caregivers will be instructed to sign the e-consent 
form. Enrollment will begin when the study staff members  receive the e-consent 
forms signed by caregivers.  
 
6.2.2 Baseline Assessment  
After receiving the signed e-consent form, caregivers will receive an email or text 
message asking them to complete the REDCap  baseline survey  that contains:  
• Sociodemographic questionnaire  
• Revised Memory and Problem Behavior Checklist   
• Preparedness for Caregiving Scale  
 
6.2.3 Module Assessment  
At the end of each online training module, there is a short survey that caregivers are 
asked to complete. The survey contains:  
• System Usability Scale  
 
6.2.4 Final Assessment  
After 6 -8 weeks post -enrollment , caregivers will receive an email or text message 
asking them to complete the REDCap  baseline survey  that contains:  
• Revised Memory and Problem Behavior Checklist   
• Preparedness for Caregiving Scale  
 
In addition , study staff members  will schedule an exit interview with participants. The 
interview will happen virtually (phone or videoconferencing) and will be under 1 
hour. We will ask participants  semi -structured questions to gauge their acceptance of 
the online learning modules and their experience completing the REDCap survey.  
 
 
Protocol Template, Version 5.0 14 7 SAFETY ASSESSMENTS   
7.1 Potential Risks and Benefits for Participation  
Potential Risks:  We believe there is minimal risk associated with participating in the 
study. The primary risks to participation are:  
• Breach of confidentiality  
• Discomfort in answering survey or interview questions  
• Discomfort with the intervention content  
Potential Benefits:  We anticipate that this research will yield important new information 
regarding the delivery of culturally competent support to Latino caregivers of PLWD. 
The results of the study will help to improve future care for Latino caregivers.  
 
7.2 Adverse Event (AE) and Serious Adverse Event (SAE) Collection and Reporting  
7.2.1 AE/SAE Definitions  
The study will adhere to the definitions for AEs and SAEs stipulated in the NIA Adverse 
Event and Serious Adverse Event Guidelines  as outlined below.  
 
AE Definition:  AE is any untoward or unfavorable medical occurrence in a human study 
participant, including increased stressed, inability to cope, or other emotional discomfort, 
temporally associated with the participants’ involvement in the research, whether or not 
considered related to participation in the research.  
 
AEs for this study include:   
This study is designed to pilot test a behavioral intervention with caregivers. As such, we 
believe it will pose minimal risk to participants because the probability and magnitude of 
harm or discomfort anticipated are not greater in and of themselves than those ordinarily 
encountered in daily life or during the performance of routine physical or psychological 
examinations or tests. The risks of participating in this study may include feeling 
discomfort discussing personal matters during the intervention, su rvey, or exit interview, 
as well as frustration as caregivers attempt to implement the suggestions of the STAR -
VTF online learning modules.  
 
SAE Definition: SAEs consist of any  adverse event that results in death; is life threatening 
or places the participant at immediate risk of death from the event as it occurred; requires 
or prolongs hospitalization; causes persistent or significant disability or incapacity; results 
in congen ital anomalies or birth defects; is another condition which investigators judge to 
represent significant hazards  
 
SAEs for this study include:   
Research activities may identify immediate risk of harm or other urgent need. While we 
would not conclude that any such emergencies are consequences of study participation or 
 
Protocol Template, Version 5.0 15 intervention content, there is still a clear obligation to report and respond appropriately to 
these urgent needs.  
 
7.2.2 Classification of Severity and Study Relatedness  
All data and safety monitoring reporting will classify SAEs and AEs as to their severity, 
expectedness, and potential relatedness to the study intervention as per the definitions 
below:  
 
Severity  
• Mild : Awareness of signs or symptoms, but easily tolerated and are of minor 
irritant type causing no loss of time from normal activities. Symptoms do not 
require therapy or a medical evaluation; signs and symptoms are transient.  
• Moderate : Events introduce a low level of inconvenience or concern to the 
participant and may interfere with daily activities, but are usually improved by 
simple therapeutic measures; moderate experiences may cause some interference 
with functioning  
• Severe :  Events interrupt the participant’s normal daily activities and generally 
require systemic drug therapy or other treatment; they are usually incapacitating  
Expectedness  
• Unexpected - nature or severity of the event is not consistent with information 
about the condition under study or intervention in the protocol, consent form, 
product brochure, or investigator brochure.  
• Expected - event is known to be associated with the intervention or condition 
under study.   
Unexpected events will be subject to expedited reporting requirements as 
described in the NIA Guidance on Clinical Trials  and in Section 1.2.3, below.  
  
Relatedness   
• Definitely Related :  The adverse event is clearly related to the investigational 
agent/procedure – i.e. an event that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from 
administration of the study intervention, follows a known or expected response 
pattern to the suspected interven tion, that is confirmed by improvement on 
stopping and reappearance of the event on repeated exposure and that could not 
be reasonably explained by the known characteristics of the subject’s clinical 
state.  
• Possibly Related :  An adverse event that follows a reasonable temporal sequence 
from administration of the study intervention follows a known or expected 
response pattern to the suspected intervention, but that could readily have been 
produced by a number of other factors . 
• Not Related :  The adverse event is clearly not related to the investigational 
agent/procedure - i.e. another cause of the event is most plausible; and/or a 
clinically plausible temporal sequence is inconsistent with the onset of the event 
 
Protocol Template, Version 5.0 16 and the study intervention and/or a causal relationship is considered biologically 
implausible.  
7.2.3 AE/SAE Reporting  
The study will adhere to the reporting requirements for AEs and SAEs stipulated in the 
NIA Adverse Event and Serious Adverse Event Guidelines  as outlined below.  
 
Process for identifying AEs and SAEs: The study staff member s, Celeste Garcia and JP 
Lopez Garcia , will be in contact with participants while carrying out research activities 
and will be able to identify any AEs and SAEs that occur. When an adverse event is 
identified, Dr. Ramirez and study staff  will follow NIA’s AE/SAE process flow . They 
will meet on a weekly basis throughout the project period and will review study progress 
and adverse events. NIA’s template for AEs  and template for SAEs  will be used to collect 
information about adverse events.  
 
Adverse event reporting schedule:   
• All adverse events  that are both  serious  (SAE) and unexpected  (i.e., have not 
been previously reported for the study’s intervention) will be reported to the 
IMPACT Collaboratory Regulatory and Data Team Leader (Julie Lima PhD), 
Advarra IRB, NIA IMPACT Collaboratory PO (Dr. Partha Bhattacharya), and the 
IMPACT Collab oratory DSMB Chair (or the project’s Safety Officer) within 48 
hours  of the study’s knowledge of SAE.  
• The summary of all other SAEs will be reported to IMPACT Collaboratory 
Regulatory and Data Team Leader (Julie Lima PhD), Advarra IRB, NIA 
IMPACT Collaboratory PO (Dr. Partha Bhattacharya), and the IMPACT 
Collaboratory DSMB Chair (or the project’s Safety Of ficer) quarterly , unless 
otherwise requested by the DSMB Chair or a Safety Officer.  
• All deaths will be reported to IMPACT Collaboratory Regulatory and Data Team 
Leader (Julie Lima PhD), Advarra IRB, NIA IMPACT Collaboratory PO (Dr. 
Partha Bhattacharya), and the IMPACT Collaboratory DSMB Chair (or the 
project’s Safety Officer) and to the DSMB Chair (or project’s Safety Officer ) 
within 24 hours  of study’s knowledge of death.  
• AEs will be reported per IRB policies and also to IMPACT Collaboratory 
Regulatory and Data Team Leader (Julie Lima PhD), Advarra IRB, NIA 
IMPACT Collaboratory PO (Dr. Partha Bhattacharya), and the IMPACT 
Collaboratory DSMB Chair (or the project’s Safety Officer) and to the DSMB 
Chair (or project’s Safety Officer ) at minimum every 6 months, or at a frequency 
requested by NIA and/or by the DSMB.  
 
8 INTERVENTION DISCONTINUATION   
The intervention will  be discontinued if they withdraw  from participation in the study at 
any time and for any reason. We will document reason for discontinuation and, with their 
 
Protocol Template, Version 5.0 17 permission, we will continue to follow -up with participants. We will replace participants 
who discontinue early (i.e., at enrollment).  
 
9 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS   
9.1 General Design Issues  
The overall objective of this pilot study is to prepare the culturally and linguistically 
adapted online training modules for Latino caregivers of PLWD and the REDCap survey 
that will be used to pragmatically collect caregiver outcomes in a future study.  Thus, the 
study was not designed to test  hypotheses.  We have selected outcome measures that have 
already been translated and validated in Spanish:  (1) Revised Memory and Behavior 
Problem Checklist27,28 and (2) Preparedness for Caregiving Scale.29  
9.2 Sample Size and Randomization  
This study does not involve randomization. We have selected a sample size of up to 20 
caregivers for study participation for pragmatic reasons (i.e., what can feasibly be 
accomplished given the study budget  and timeline ).  
9.3 Interim analyses  and Stopping Rules  
We are not planning to conduct an interim analysis. Given the small sample of the pilot 
study, it is not possible to detect a significant positive or negative effect of the 
intervention to terminate recruitment early. Thus, we believe that a decision to 
prematurely terminate study recruitment or study intervention is not possible.  
We have allocated 4 months of our 12 -month study to recruiting study participants. If we 
are unable to recruit at least 5 study participants during that 4 -month period, we will stop 
the study due to slow accrual.  
9.4 Outcomes  
9.4.1 Primary outcome   
The primary outcomes are : (1) Revised Memory and Behavior Problem Checklist and 
(2) Preparedness for Caregiving Scale. We will collect these outcomes at baseline and 
6-8 weeks post -enrollment  via a REDCap survey .  
1. Revised Memory and Behavior Problem Checklist .27,28 Caregivers will rate 
memory, depression, and disruptive behavior problems in the PLWD. The instrument  
contains 24 items (7 memory -related, 8 depressive, and 9 disruptive) that assess 
problem behaviors and are rated for frequency of occurrence during the past week 
and caregiver reaction to the problem behaviors.  
 
2. Preparedness for Caregiving Scale.29 Caregivers will rate how prepared they are for 
various aspects of caregiving. The instrument  contains 8 items that ask caregivers 
how well prepared they believe they are to provide physical care, emotional support, 
deal with the stress of caregiving, and set up in -home support services. Each item is 
rated on a 5 -point scale ranging from 0 (not at  all prepared) to 5 (very well prepared).  
 
Protocol Template, Version 5.0 18  
9.4.2 Secondary outcomes   
The secondary outcomes the System Usability Scale . We will collect th is outcome 
each time a caregiver completes an online training module. The instrument  will be  
embedded within the modules.  
• System Usability Scale .30 Caregivers will rate how easy the online  training module s 
are to use . The instrument  contains 10 items . Each item is rated on a 5-point scale 
ranging from 0 ( strongly disagree ) to 7 (strongly agree ).  
 
Secondary outcomes will also include caregivers’ acceptance of the online training  
modules , their experience completing the REDCap survey , and their adherence to the 
online training  modules . We will develop a semi -structured interview guide t o 
qualitativel y assess, during exit interviews , caregiver acceptance and experience 
completing the REDCap survey. We will obtain caregiver completion rates of online 
training  modules using built -in metrics from the Kaiser Permanente School of Allied 
Health Sciences learning management system . 
 
9.5 Data Analyses  
For analysis of  quantitative outcomes, we will use descriptive statistics. For qualitative 
outcomes, we will use analytic procedures in qualitative research.31 Given the small 
sample size and study objectives, we will not perform subgroup analyses.  
 
10 DATA COLLECTION AND QUALITY ASSURANCE  
10.1 Data Collection Forms  
We will collect data on the R evised Memory and Behavior Problem Checklist and the 
Preparedness for Caregiving Scale via a REDCap survey . We will deliver a link to the 
survey via an email or text  message . Caregivers will be instructed to follow the link and 
complete the survey.  
 
We will collect data on the System Usability  Scale  via a REDCap survey . We will deliver 
a link to the survey via an email or text message. Caregivers will be instructed to follow 
the link and complete the survey . 
 
We will collect qualitative data during exit interviews that will be conducted by Dr. 
Ramirez , Celeste Garcia, and/or JP Lopez Garcia . The interviews will be audio recorded, 
and we will also take notes during and after the interview.  
10.2 Data Management  
Data collection and management  will be the responsibility of the University of 
Washington.  All data collected from participants will be labeled with a unique study 
identification number and not the participant’s name or any other information that could 
 
Protocol Template, Version 5.0 19 identify the participant. Only the study identification number will appear on data records 
and computer files. The contact information of study participants will be kept in a 
password -protected file and computer. All data collected from participants will b e kept 
confidential and accessible only by Dr. Ramirez , Celeste Garcia, and JP Lopez Garcia  at 
the University of Washington. Dr. Penfold will view only summaries of aggregated data. 
We will not use participants names in reports of study findings, REDCap su rveys, or 
audio recordings of interviews. Instead, we will label everything with the study 
identification number. We will destroy data that identifies participants when we have 
finished recruitment. We plan to keep de -identified data indefinitely.  
10.3 Quality Assurance  
10.3.1  Training  
As is the case with a ll investigators, key personnel, and all those responsible for the 
design and conduct of research  at the University of Washington, Dr. Ramirez , Celeste 
Garcia, and JP Lopez Garcia  have  receive d training  on the protection of human 
subjects.  Dr. Ramirez will be responsible for training study staff members  on the 
study protocol.  
10.3.2  Quality Control Committee  
This study will not utilize a  quality control committee . 
10.3.3  Metrics  
We will use a log to document whether and when caregivers enrolled in the study 
were prompted to complete outcome assessments via the REDCap survey. Th e log 
will also document whether and when an exit interview has been scheduled. We will 
review the log on a weekly basis.   
10.3.4  Protocol  Deviations  
We will use a protocol deviation  log. The log will enable us to  capture a description 
of the protocol deviation, the deviation category (e.g., safety, informed consent, 
eligibility, protocol implementation), date the deviation occurred, and date the 
institutional review board was notified.  
10.3.5  Monitoring  
Dr. Ramirez will be responsible for  regularly  monitoring  all aspects of the study to 
assure protocol compliance, data quality, etc.   
 
11 PARTICIPANT  RIGHTS AND CONFIDENTIALITY   
11.1 Institutional Review Board (IRB) Review  
This protocol and the informed consent document and any subsequent modifications will 
be reviewed and approved by the IRB responsible for study oversight.    
 
Protocol Template, Version 5.0 20 11.2 Informed Consent Form  
Consent forms in English and Spanish will be IRB -approved and the participant will be 
asked to read and review the document. Using the language preferred by participants 
(English or Spanish), the study staff member will explain the research study to the 
participant and answer any questions that may arise. A verbal explanation will be 
provided in terms suited to the participant’s comprehension of the purposes, procedures, 
and potential risks of the study and of their rights as research participants. Participants 
will be informed that participat ion is voluntary and that they may withdraw from the 
study at any time, without prejudice, and that the quality of their medical care will not be 
adversely affected if they decline to participate in this study. Participants will have the 
opportunity to carefully review the electronic  consent form and ask questions prior to 
signing. The participants will be given a copy of the informed e-consent form  so that they 
may discuss the study with their family or surrogates or think about it prior to agreeing to 
participate . The informed e-consent process will be conducted and documented in 
REDCap (including the date), and the form e-signed, before the participant undergoes 
any study -specific procedures. A copy of the  signed  informed e-consent document will be 
sent to the participants for their records .  
11.3 Participant Confidentiality  
Any data, fo rms, reports, audio  recordings, and other records will be identified only by a 
participant identification number to maintain confidentiality. All records will be kept in a 
locked file cabinet. All computer entry and networking programs will be done using 
participant identification numbers only. Information will not be released without written 
permission of the participant, except as necessary for monitoring by IRB, the FDA, the 
NIA, and the  OHRP . 
11.4 Study Discontinuation  
The study may be discontinued at any time by the IRB, the NIA, the OHRP, the FDA, or 
other government agencies as part of their duties to ensure that research participants are 
protected.  
12 ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
This study will follow the seven main principles that the NIH Clinical Center  has 
described as guiding the conduct of ethical research :32 
• Social and clinical value  
• Scientific validity  
• Fair subject selection  
• Favorable risk -benefit ratio

Key information about this study  

 
Protocol Template, Version 5.0 32 We are asking you to be in a research study. This form explains the details of the study. Please 
read this entire form before agreeing to join the study. You do not have to be in this study. If you 
say yes, you can quit the study at any time.  
 
The study, Virtual Training for Latino Caregivers to Manage Symptoms of Dementia, is about an 
online program we are designing to better support family caregivers of people living with dementia 
(PLWD). Our goal is to learn how we can design the online progr am to better meet the needs of 
family caregivers. We will do this by asking family caregivers to use the online program. We will 
also ask caregivers to answer survey questions and participate in an interview. This study is being 
conducted by the University  of Washington (UW) and is funded by the NIA IMPACT 
Collaboratory.  
 
This study may not help you personally, but we hope the results of this study will help improve 
care in the future. You might feel uncomfortable with the program materials or with answering 
some study questions. You may skip any part of the program you don ’t want participate in. You 
may also skip any questions you don’t want to answer. In addition, the interview could last up to 
60 minutes. We can schedule the interview on a date and time that is convenient for you. It’s 
possible that someone other than the  researchers could find out you were in the study or see your 
private information.   
 
What will happen if I take part in this study?  
If you are eligible and want to join the study, we will ask you to:  
 
Use an online program for a period of 6 weeks. The online program consists of 6 videos. You 
would watch the videos at home from any device that you prefer to use. We will ask you to watch 
one video per week. The videos will provide information to help you better manage behavior al and 
psychological symptoms of dementia (e.g., agitation, sleep disturbance, aggression).  
 
Complete online surveys. The surveys will ask you about the following:  
• Sociodemographic characteristics (e.g., age, gender, race, ethnicity)  
• Occurrence and frequency of dementia symptoms in the PLWD and your reactions to 
these symptoms  
• How prepared you feel for various aspects of caregiving  
• How easy or hard you think the online program is to use  
• How useful you think the online program is to use  
 
Take part in an in -person interview that will last up to 60 minutes. During the interview, a UW 
researcher will ask about your experience using the online program. They will also ask about your 
experience completing the online surveys. For example, what you liked about the program, what 
you did not like about the program, and how we can make the program better in the future.  We will 
audio record the interview. Anything you say that could identify you will not be written down.  
 
The interview recording and other information about you that we collect through the surveys will 
be labeled with a code number instead of your name.  
 
 
Protocol Template, Version 5.0 33 We will provide you with $40 to thank you for taking part in the study.   
 
Using Your Data in Future Research  
The interview recording and other information about you that we collect through the surveys 
may be used or distributed for future research studies without your additional informed consent.  
 
Will there be any costs to me?  
There will not be any costs to you.   
 
Will being in this study help me?  
This study will not help you personally, but we hope the results of this study will help improve 
care in the future.  
 
Can anything bad happen to me from being in this study?  
You might feel uncomfortable with the program materials or with answering some survey or 
interview questions. You may skip any part of the program you don’t want participate in. You may 
also skip any questions you don’t want to answer.  
 
It is possible that someone other than the researchers could find out you were in the study or see 
your private study information. The steps we take to keep this from happening are described 
below.  
 
How will you protect my confidentiality?  
This study is being done by researchers at the UW. They are listed above. These researchers sign a

or write it on recordings of the interview. Instead, we wil l label everything with a code number 
only. We will store the interview recording and other information about you that we collect 
through the surveys in secure databases at the UW. We will destroy data that identifies you when 
we have finished recruitment.  We plan to keep your de -identified study information as described in 
this form indefinitely.   
 
Do I have to be in this study?  
No, being in this study is up to you. You are free to say no now or to leave the study at any time 
later. Either way, there will be no penalty. Your decision won't affect the healthcare you receive or

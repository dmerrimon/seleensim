Alzheimer’s Disease  
(Rasagiline Rescue in Alzheimer’s Disease Clinical Trial ) 
 
STUDY NAME  R2 Trial  
NAME OF ACTIVE 
INGREDIENT  Rasagiline mesylate  
NAME OF INVESTIGATIONAL 
PRODUCT  Azilect® (rasagiline)  
STUDY PHASE  Phase II  
INDICATION  Mild to Moderate Alzheimer’s Disease  
PRIMARY OBJECTIVE  To determine if exposure to 1 mg of Rasagiline daily  is associated with 
improved regional brain metabolism in the treatment group compared to the 
placebo group in Alzheimer’s Disease patients  
 
SECONDARY OBJECTIVES   To evaluate the efficacy of Rasagiline 1 mg once daily compared to 
placebo after a 24-week treatment on cognition (ADAS -Cog 11), 
activities of daily living (ADCS -ADL), global function ( CGIC ), and 
neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPI)  
 To evaluate the efficacy of Rasagiline 1 mg once daily compared to  
placebo after 24 week treatment on measures of executive function 
(mazes a nd cancellation of the ADAS -Cog, Digit Span test, and 
Controlled Oral Word Association Test [COWAT] for verbal 
fluency) To evaluate the safety and tolerability of rasagiline as 
measured by incidence of adverse events/serious adverse events 
(AEs/SAEs) , clinical lab oratory  test data, vital signs, 12 lead EKG 
data, brain MRI findin gs 
 To correlate the relationship of changes in 18F-AV-1451  Tau imaging 
to clinical measures  
 
STUDY DES IGN This is a Phase II, randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, parallel 
group, proof -of-concept three -site study, to evaluate the effect of rasagiline in 
the regional brain metabolism on FDG PET.

Phase 2 Study – Rasagiline AD Protocol  12 of 54   A 24 -WEEK, THREE -SITE, RANDOMIZED, DOUBLE BLIND, PLACEBO CONTROLLED, 
PARALLEL GROUP, PROOF -OF-CONCEPT STUDY TO EVALUATE THE EFFECT OF 
RASAGILINE IN THE REGIONAL BRAIN METABOLISM ON FDG PET IN PATIENTS WITH 
MILD TO MODERATE ALZHEIMER’S DISEASE  
 
Rasagiline  Rescue  in Alzheimer’s Disease Clinical Trial (R2 Trial)  
 
1.  Novelty and Relevance  
1.1 Introduction  
Rasagiline is a selective monoamine oxidase B (MAO -B) inhibitor.  Rasagiline has been used 
extensively for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease (PD) where it is approved for signs and symptoms 
of idiopathic PD as initial monotherapy and as adjunct therapy to levodopa (package insert).  Rasagiline 
is currently being studied in a 24 -week, multi -center, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, 
add-on parallel group study to assess the efficacy of rasagiline on cognition in patients with Parkinson’s 
diseas e (Study TBT -1012 -PM106).  Pre -clinical observations (summarized below) document 
neuroprotective activities of rasagiline beyond those of MAO -B inhibition.  The pre -clinical evidence, 
utility in PD, and the history of benefit of selegiline ---a related MAO -B inhibitor ---in Alzheimer’s 
disease (AD), provide the rational for a clinical trial of rasagiline in AD.  This proposal outlines a 
clinical trial based on a partnership between the Alzheimer’s Drug Discovery Foundation (ADDF) , 
Cleveland Clinic Lou Ruvo Ce nter for Brain Health and ADM Diagnostics LLC (ADMdx) to conduct 
a clinical trial in mild to moderate AD.   
 
Several novel aspects are incorporated in the clinical trial design presented.  Rasagiline is a repurposed 
agent and repurposing has many benefits in terms of accelerating development of AD therapies (1,2).   
The use of a biomarker as a primary outcome --- fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography 
(FDG PET) --- is also a novel approach and allows a smaller number of patients to be recruited int o the 
trial.  The incorporation of Tau imaging with the novel ligand T807 (Avid Radiopharmaceuticals) is 
also innovative and has the opportunity to advance understanding of neuroprotection, neurofibrillary 
tangles, and tau imaging. This is the first clinic al trial in which positive tau imaging will be required at 
baseline.  Tau imaging will be secondary outcome of the trial, and there will be opportunities to 
understand the information provided by tau imaging as a complement to FDG imaging. The use of the 
Cleveland Clinic Lou Ruvo Center for Brain Health’s distributed clinical trial infrastructure is also a 
trial innovation.  Recruitment sites will include the Lou Ruvo Center for Brain Health in Las Vegas, 
Nevada (led by Jeffrey Cummings, MD, ScD and Kate Zh ong, MD) and the Lou Ruvo Center for Brain 
Health in Cleveland, Ohio (led by James Leverenz, MD with referrals from the Lakewood Campus site 
led by Babak Tousi, MD).  In addition, we will add novel , clinical trial outcomes sensitive to executive 
function a nd relevant to dopamine D1 receptor activation anticipated with MAO -B inhibition.  
Together, these novel trial design aspects promise to advance an understanding of rasagiline as well as 
to enhance clinical trial methodologies for AD drug development.  
 
1.2. Preclinical  Data  
Rasagiline is a selective MAO -B inhibitor (3).  Rasagiline has been shown to have neuroprotective, 
antiapoptotic action dependent on B CL-2, protein kinase C (PKC), and the proteasome -ubiquitin 
complex (4).  Importantly, the S -Isomer of rasagiline (TBT1022) is more than 1,000 times less potent 
as a MAO inhibitor and exhibits comparable neuroprotective activity.  In pre -clinical experiments, 
TBT1022 protects mitochondrial viability by activating BCL -2 and PKC and by down - regulating the 
proapopotic FAS Bax protein families (5).  Importantly, from an AD therapeutic perspective,

Amendment # 5 dated 17 Feb 2017    
Phase 2 Study – Rasagiline AD Protocol  13 of 54   propargylamine -containing compounds such as rasagiline modulate proteolytic cleavage of the amyloid 
beta precursor protein (APP), decreasing beta amyloid production by  activation of the non -amyloid 
genic  alpha -secretase pathway.  This effect involves activation of mitogen -activated protein kinase 
(MAPK) and PKC (6, 7).   
 
These kinases are deregulated in AD and they contribute to tau hyperphosphorylation and the formation 
of neurofibrillary tangles ( 31, 32 ). These observations link rasagiline to tau hyperphosphorylation, 
neurofibrillary tangle formation, and possibly detectable effects on tau imaging ( 33, 34 )  
 
1.3. Pharmacology  of Rasagiline  
Rasagiline is a selec tive, potent and irreversible MAO -B inhibitor.  It is well absorbed from the 
gastrointestinal tract and is highly blood -brain barrier penetrant.  Unlike selegiline, it is not metabolized 
to amphetamine -like derivatives (8).  Rasagiline has a molecular weig ht of 267.34 Daltons.  It has a 
100-fold selectivity for MAO -B compared to MAO -A.  Rasagiline is metabolized through the CYP1A2 
cytochrome P450 enzyme system and 1A2 inhibitors should be avoided in patients receiving treatment 
with rasagiline (3).  The maj or metabolite of rasagiline is 1(R) -aminoindan which at doses used in 
humans is unlikely to function as a MAO inhibitor.  The T -max of Rasagiline is 1 hour.  High fat meals 
impair the absorption of the drug reducing the Cmax and area under the curve (AUC) by 60% and 20% 
respectively.  The Tmax of rasagiline is not affected by food and the reduction in AUC is not statistically 
significant.  Plasma protein binding ranges from 88% - 94% and the mean volume of distribution at 
steady state is 87 liters.  There i s virtually complete biotransformation before excretion with 
dealkylation and hydroxylation followed by glucuronidation and conjugation (3).  The principal side 
effects observed in clinical trials in patients with PD include dyskinesia, nausea, falls, weig ht loss, 
constipation, postural hypertension, arthralgia, vomiting, abdominal pain, anorexia, and abnormal 
dreams.   
 
Drug -drug interactions are historically a concern with MAO inhibitors, particularly tyramine -rich foods 
and beverages.  Although such interactions have not been problematic in patients with selective MAO -
B inhibitors, foods with particularly high concentra tions of tyramine (aged cheese, sauerkraut, sausage, 
pickled herring) will be avoided in the course of the study.  Similarly, sympathomimetic agents will 
also be avoided in trial participants.   
 
As a repurposed agent, rasagiline has substantial advantages since there is extensive study of the 
pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the compound in both healthy volunteers and patients with 
PD.   
 
1.4. Clinical  Data  
Rasagiline has been extensively studied in the treatment  of PD (9).  Among the most important studies 
was the Attenuation of Disease Progression with Azilect® Given Once Daily (ADAGIO) study (10 , 
11).  A secondary analysis of the ADAGIO study (12) provided additional insight into the trial 
outcomes.  Of particu lar importance is the attention to non -motor outcomes including cognition 
presented in the secondary analysis.  Both the 1mg and 2mg doses were associated with an improvement 
in the activities of daily living subscore as well as the UPDRS mentation subscor e and the Parkinson 
Fatigue Scale (12).  The ADAGIO study suggests that cognitive impairment in PD was improved 
through treatment with rasagiline.  Many of the mechanisms of rasagiline relevant to its activity in PD 
are also relevant to the treatment of AD .   
 
Further support for pursuing a clinical trial of rasagiline in AD is provided by the double -blind, placebo 
controlled trial of selegiline, alpha -tocopherol and a combination of both of these agents compared to 
placebo in treatments with AD (13).  In t his study of patients with moderate AD, there were significant

therapy.  Primary outcomes included death, institutionalization, and loss of the ability to perform 
activities of daily living or severe dementia (defined as a Clinical Dementia Rating score of 3).   
 
1.5. Application  to Alzheimer’s disease  
The data available for PD and for AD suggest a pharmacologic profile of rasagiline compatible with 
either d isease modification or symptomatic improvement or both.  Enhanced mitochondrial function 
and improved dopamine neurotransmitter function would be anticipated to provide symptomatic benefit 
whereas the antiapoptotic neuroprotective activity of Rasagiline wo uld be expected to provide disease 
modification.  The proposed clinical trial will not resolve whether one or both of these important 
therapeutic modalities are predominant.  The clinical trial is designed to demonstrate if there is 
enhanced metabolism in a treatment group compared to a placebo -control. The mechanism of rasagiline 
is highly supportive of an effect on AD with aspects such as modulation of APP metabolism uniquely 
relevant to AD.  
 
2. Supporting Data  
 
FDG PET analyses and interpretation as well  as site qualification will be done by ADMdx.  This section 
provides background information on the analytic methodology to be used in this study.  Technical 
aspects of site qualification, scanner variables, and PET and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 
acqu isition are presented in the appendix.  
 
18F-AV-1451  Tau imaging data will be analyzed by ADMd x. 
 
All clinical and imaging data  will be integrated through a database constructed by the Alzheimer’s 
Disease Cooperative Study (ADCS) and clinical -imaging integr ation analyses will be conducted in 
conjunction with ADCS statisticians (http://ADCS.org).  
 
 
 2.1. Glucose  Metabolism as a Biomarker of Neuronal Function   
The loss of synaptic activity and neuronal function is closely associated with reductions in glucose  
metabolism, a primary energy source that is measurable using FDG PET (14 , 15). AD is characterized 
by a specific, progressive pattern of hypometabolism that begins in medial temporal and posterior 
cingulate cortices, extends to temporo -parietal cortices an d eventually affects most cortical regions. 
Different types of dementia are characterized by distinctive patterns of decline (16), which in turn 
correlate with the domains of cognition and function that become impaired (17).  Representative 
patterns from t wo different types of dementia are shown in Figure 1 below, where blue represents 
significant declines in glucose metabolism relative to normal controls.   
 
ADMdx has focused on the use of FDG PET, amyloid PET, and other markers to differentiate dementia 
types, predict cognitive trajectory, measure longitudinal change, and assess pharmacologic effects on 
brain glucose metabolism.  This has included the application of advanced machine learning approaches, 
optimized image quality control and processing, and c ollection of extensive reference data for the 
detection of disease, longitudinal change, and drug effect.

2.2 Dementia  Classifier  
The ADMdx Dementia Classifier is a machine learning -based software tool that has been trained to 
differentiate different forms of dementia using the FDG PET scans of 133 subjects with clinical 
diagnoses including Normal, AD, Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD), and Lewy Body Disease (LBD) 
(with pathology  or autopsy confirmation where available). The classifier compares the voxels of an 
independent test subject scan to a series of image patterns (canonical variables) that uniquely combine 
to characterize each type of dementia. The probability of a match wi th each dementia is determined. 
Validation was performed using a Leave -One-Out (LOO) approach and with completely independent 
test subjects.  Accuracies achieved in the LOO analysis were: AD vs. FTD 96%, AD vs. Semantic 
Dementia 97%, and AD vs. LBD 100%. T he classifier was subsequently applied to other scans 
including those of subjects participating in studies of bapineuzumab.  It was found that subjects with 
amyloid plaque were more likely to show hypometabolic FDG patterns as identified using ADMdx’s 
deme ntia classification software, and that patients without AD pathology were less likely to show an 
AD pattern (18). ADMdx is continuing to refine its classification approaches.  
 
2.3. AD  Progression Classifier  
ADMdx has also developed a classifier trained on  subjects from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative (ADNI) database with clinical diagnoses of Normal (negative for AD), Normal -declined, mild 
cognitive impairment (MCI), MCI who converted to AD, and AD.  This classifier assigns a numeric 
score to each independent test subject that reflects the degree to which the subject expresses a pattern 
of decline within regions including those shown in Figure 2 (19).

Phase 2 Study – Rasagiline AD Protocol  16 of 54   As a further illustration of the AD Progression Classifier, Figure 3 shows the mean (and S.E.M.) 
progression scores for Normal (NL), Early MCI (EMCI), Late MCI (LMCI), and AD subjects from  
ADNI, all amyloid positive as measured using amyloid PET scans (20).  For each diagnostic class, the 
score at baseline and at 24 months post -baseline are shown.  It can be seen that the score captures the 
progression of hypometabolism across diagnostic classes, as well as the 24 -month progression within 
those classes.  Rate of decline is greatest in AD subjects.  
 
 
 
2.4. Predicting  Cognitive  Trajectories  
We have applied the AD Progression Classifier to 72 NL (40 with amyloid data available), 173 MCI 
(87 with amyloid data available), and 50 AD subjects from the ADNI database, comparing the classifier 
score as a predictor of decline i n MMSE, CDR -sum of boxes (CDR -sb), and ADAS -Cog 11 to other 
predictors (baseline MMSE, baseline CDR -sb, baseline ADAS -Cog 11, and amyloid cortical average 
Standardized Uptake Value Ratio (SUVr)). Results indicated that the AD Progression score was a 
signif icant predictor of decline in these measures and a better predictor than the other variables tested6. 
The classifier was also applied to patients in a trial of bapineuzumab, with the result that more severe 
hypometabolism at baseline as identified by ADMdx’s AD Progression Classifier was a strong 
predictor of subsequent clinical decline over the course of the trials (18).

Phase 2 Study – Rasagiline AD Protocol  17 of 54   2.5 Glucose  Metabolism as a Measure of Drug Effects  
 
In addition to measuring disease -related changes in neuronal activity, FDG PET can capture drug -related 
effects, even in small group sizes and at acute doses, depending upon effect.  Figure 4 shows the acute 
effects of a lower and higher dose of an NK1 ant agonist compound as measured in a double -blinded 
randomized crossover study of 10 normal healthy volunteers.  Acute changes observed in glucose 
metabolism were consistent with clinical effects observed in a separate chronic dosing study. The graph in 
Figur e 4 shows each subject’s expression of the primary pattern of change for placebo and each treatment 
dose.  These results were obtained using ADMdx’s multivariate pattern analysis software (NPAIRS), which 
uses Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Canonica l Variate Analysis (CVA) to segregate signal from 
noise, identify the component patterns contributing to overall effect, determine the relative contribution of 
each pattern, measure each subject’s relative expression of the pattern, and provide metrics reg arding the 
reproducibility and predictive power of the group results, and identify patterns of effect. It provides a 
powerful tool to gain insight into treatment effects (21 , 22).  
 
 
2.6 Tau Imaging as a Measure of Drug Effect  
Several  kinases (e.g., MAPK P CK) are deregulated in AD and they contribute to tau hyperphosphorylation 
and the formation of neurofibrillary tangles ( 31, 32 ). These observations link rasagiline to tau 
hyperphosphorylation, neurofibrillary tangle formation, and possibly detectable effec ts on tau imaging ( 33, 
34)  
The incorporation of Tau imaging with the novel ligand18F-AV-1451  (Avid Radiopharmaceuticals)  provides  
the opportunity to advance understanding of neuroprotection, neurofibrillary tangles, and tau imaging. This 
is the first clinical trial in which tau imaging will be required at baseline.  Tau im aging will be secondary 
outcome  of the trial, and there will be opportunities to understand the information provided by tau imaging 
as a complement to FDG imaging.

precludes further participation in the trial  
 Unacceptable toxicity or any adverse event that precludes further participation in the trial  
 The investigator removes the patient from the trial in the best interests of the patient  
 Non-adherence to study regimen as determined by pill count  
 Patient withdra ws consent to continued participation in the trial  
 
Patients who withdr aw prior to study completion will be asked to return to the clinic to complete 
visit 6 (end of study) assessments.  
 
5.5 Data Collection and Follow -up for Withdrawn Subjects  
 All subjects who discontinue the trial prematurely will be followed.  
 Every effort will be made to maintain contact with patients discontinuing treatment during the 
course of the trial.  
 Reasons for withdrawal will be investigated and documented . 
 All effort s should be made to document the outcome following the withdrawal . 
 Patients who withdrew from the study will not be replaced.  
6. STUDY TREATMENT  
6.1 Study Drug  
Azilect® tablets contain rasagiline (as the mesylate), a propargylamine -based drug indicated for 
the treatment of idiopathic Parkinson's disease. It is designated chemically as: 1H -Inden -1-amine, 
2, 3 -dihydro -N-2-propynyl -, (1R) -, methanesulfonate. The empirical formula of rasagiline 
mesylate is (C12H13N ) CH4SO3  and its molecular weight is 267.34.  
Its structural formula is:  
                                                       
 
Rasagiline mesylate is a white to off -white powder, freely soluble in water or ethanol and sparingly 
soluble in isopropanol. Each Azilect tablet for oral administration contains rasagiline mesylate 
equivalent to 0.5 mg or 1 mg of rasagiline base.

Phase 2 Study – Rasagiline AD Protocol  23 of 54   Each Azilect tablet also contains the following inactive ingredients mannitol, starch, pregelatinized 
starch, colloidal silicon dioxide, stearic acid and talc.The matching placeb o will look exactly like 
the study medication to maintain the double  blind design of the study.  
 
6.2  Treatment Regimen  
Subjects will be randomized to a 1:1 ratio to receive Rasagiline or the matching placebo 24 -week 
double blind treatment.  
Subjects will take one 0.5 mg rasagiline tablet or the matching placebo once a day on Baseline (Day 
1) through Week 4. The dose will be titrated up to one 1 mg tablet or the matching placebo once a 
day starting on Week 5  until the Week 28 (end of treatment  visit).  
6.3 Administration of Treatment  
Study medication should be administered once daily, with or without food.  Subjects will swallow 
all oral ly administered study medication as a whole and will not chew the medication before 
swallowing.  
Patients will be given 1 month supply of 0.5 mg rasagiline or matching placebo tablets to take home 
on the day of randomization ( Visit 2) with detailed instruction of taking one capsule once a day for 
4 weeks. Patient is to return to clinic for Visit 3 (We ek 4), when the dose will be increased to 1 
tablet of 1 mg rasagiline or matching placebo  once a day. Patients are to continue taking 1 tablet of 
1 mg rasagiline or matching placebo once a day for the next 20 weeks of treatment.

8. Study Specific Procedures  
 
8.1 Cognitive Evaluations  
 
8.1.1  Mini -Mental Sta te Examination (MMSE)  
The MMSE (Folstein et al., 1975) is a brief, frequently used screening instrument for AD drug 
studies. The MMSE evaluates orientation, memory, attention, concentration, naming, 
repetition, comprehension, and ability to create a sentence and to copy two ove rlapping 
pentagons. A lower score indicates more cognitive impairment. The highest score is 30. 
Participants with MMSE scores outside the range of 12-26 (inclusive) will not be included in 
this study. This test will be administered at Screening, Baseline, and Week 24. 
 
8.1.2  Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale -Cognitive 11 (ADAS -Cog 11) 
The ADAS -Cog (Rosen et al., 1984) is a psychometric instrument that evaluates memory, 
attention, reasoning, language, orientation, and praxis. A higher score indicates more  
impairment. Scores from the original portion of the test range from 0 (best) to 70 (worse). A 
positive change indicates cognitive worsening. This test will be administered at Baseline, 
Weeks 4 , 8, 24 and 28. 
 
 
8.2 Clinical and Functional Evaluations  
 
8.2.1  Clinician Global  Impression of Change ( CGIC ) 
This is a rating scale of global impression of change. The CGIC  is a clinician assessment of 
change in the patient’s functioning administered to the patient and the  caregiver. This test will 
be conducted  at Baseline , Week 4, Week 24, and Week 28.  
 
8.2.2 Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study - Activities of Daily Living (ADCS -ADL)  
The ADCS -ADL is an activities -of-daily -living inventory developed by the ADCS to assess 
functional performance in participants with AD (Galasko et al., 1997). Using a structured 
interview format, study partners are queried as to whether participants attemp ted each item in 
the inventory during the past 4 weeks and their level of performance. The ADCS -ADL scale 
discriminates well between normal participants and those with mild AD and it has good test -
retest reliability. The ADCS -ADL includes some items from t raditional basic ADL tests (e.g., 
grooming, dressing, walking, bathing, feeding, toileting) as well as instrumental (complex) 
activities of daily living (e.g., shopping, preparing meals, using household  appliances, keeping 
appointments, reading). This tes t will be administered at Baseline, Weeks 4 , 8, 24, and 28 . 
 
8.2.3 Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI)  
The behavioral outcome measure for this trial is the NPI (Cummings, 1997). The NPI is a well 
validated, reliable, multi -item instrument to assess psychopath ology in AD based on interview 
with the study partner. The NPI evaluates both the frequency and severity of 10 
neuropsychiatric disturbances. Frequency assessments range from 1 (occasionally, less than 
once per week) to 4 (very frequently, once or more per  day or continuously) as well as severity 
(1=mild, 2=moderate, 3=severe). The overall score and the score for each subscale are the

Phase 2 Study – Rasagiline AD Protocol  32 of 54   product of severity and frequency. This test will be administered at Baseline, Week s 4, 8, 24  
and 28. 
 
 
8.2.4 Controlled Oral Word Association Test  (COWAT)  
This is a 3 -4 minute measure of phonological fluency that indexes a number of the  processes 
described as ‘executive function ,’ including, planning, strategy and working memory. Study 
participants are instructed, “ I want to see how many words you can say beginning with a certain 
letter in one minute. Don’t say proper nouns or numbers or the same word with a different 
ending and try not to repeat yourself. The letter is ‘ -, begin .” The study participant’s responses 
are reco rded on the worksheet. Study participants are then given an additional one minute for 
each of two different letters using similar instructions.  
 
Responses are then judged for their acceptability (example for the use of proper nouns, 
numbers, repetitions and stem word with a different ending). The score is the total number of 
acceptable words for the three trials combined. A higher score represents better performance. 
This test will be administered at Baseline, Week 4, Week 8, Week 24, and Week 28.  
 
8.2.5 Digit Span   
The Digit Span Test is adopted from the Wechsler Memory Scale and consists of repetition of  
increasing long strings of digits presented at 1 per second as read by the examiner and repeated 
by the subject.  A normal Digit Span is 7 digits forwar d +/- 2 digits. The score is the maximum 
number of digits the patient can repeat until they fail twice in a row.  The reverse digit span is 
identical to the forward digit span except that the patient repeats the presented digits in reverse 
order.  A normal  reverse digit span is 5 +/ - 1 digit.  The score is the maximum number of digits 
the patient can repeat in reverse order until they fail twice in a row.  This test will be 
administered at Baseline, Weeks 4 , 8, 24, and 28 . 
 
8.2.6    QoL -AD/Study Partner  
The QoL -AD is a commonly used 13 item QoL scale that assesses items specific to QoL in 
patients  with cognitive impairment.  It is administered to the research partner with answers for 
the patient. This assessment will be performed at the Baseline and Week 24 visits.    
8.2.7    Ohio State University Traumatic Brain Injury Identification Method (OSU TBI -ID)    
      Questionnaire  
Traumatic brain injury (TBI) can lead to tau protein deposition in the brain and these changes 
could be visualized on18F-AV-1451   Tau imaging.  To account for any contribution of TBI to 
the imaging findings , the Ohio State University (OSU) TBI Identification Method (OSU TBI -
ID) is being utilized.  The OSU TBI -ID is a standardized procedure for eliciting a person’s 
lifetime history of TBI via a 3 -5 minute structured interview. While recall by an individual, 
parent or significant other is not ideal for d etermining lifetime exposure to potentially 
damaging brain injury, self -report remains the gold standard  for research and clinical us e.  
Physicians, nurses and mental health professionals working with military per sonnel need this 
tool to elicit a  complete history of TBI.  The validity of the OSU TBI -ID is not based on 
elicitation of a veridical accounting of a person's lifetime history o f TBI. Instead, the OSU TBI -
ID provides data for calculating summary indices reflecting the likelihood that consequences 
have resulted from lifetime exposure to TBI. Initial validation research has supported the 
psychometric qualities of these summary indi ces. Reliability has been demonstrated by both 
inter-rater and test/re -test reliability (Corrigan & Bogner, 2007;  Bogner & Corrigan, 2009). 
Predictive validity has been shown by the relationship between indices of lifetime history and

(Corrigan & Bogner, 2007; Bogner & Corrigan, 2009). Summary indices from the OSU TBI -
ID can be used in both research and clinical care   (35, 36).   This assessment will be 
completed at  the Screening and Week 24 visits.  
9. Study Methods  
 
9.1 Safety Assessments  
At each study visit, adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs)  will be reviewed ; vital 
signs and weight will be done for safety assessment s. Hematology, blood chemistr y, and liver 
function tests will be collected at Screening visit and Week 24.  
 
Potential adverse events will be reviewed by the Principal Investigator and documented. Adverse 
events include signs or symptoms that may or may not be related to study medicat ion, abnormalities 
detected on physical examination, or clinically significant laboratory abnormalities. Adverse events 
will be graded (mild: causing no limitation of usual activities; moderate: causing some limitation 
of usual activities; severe: causing inability to carry out usual activities) and recorded on case report 
forms.  
 
9.2  Concomitant Medications  
Concomitant medications will be recorded at each visit based on the study partner interview and 
any other available information. After randomization, initiation of any excluded medication, or 
change in permitted agents will be discouraged. However, follow -up of all participants, regardless 
of compliance with medication restrictions, will be continued in order to maximize the data 
available for the inten t to treat analysis.  
 
Initiation during the study of medications which are excluded because of confounding effects on 
cognitive outcomes (such as sedating or anticholinergic medications) is discouraged, but will not 
require termination of study drug or exclusion from the ITT analysis. Cessation or change of anti -
dementia therapies during the study is also discouraged, but will also not prevent continued 
participation in the protocol or inclusion in the intent to treat analysis.  
 
9.3 Physical Examination  
A brief physical examination will be performed by a medically qualified professional at the 
Screening visit and Week 24. A review of the major body systems will be performed for example: 
skin, head/ears/eyes/nose/throat (HEENT), cardiovascular, pulmonary, abdomen, musculoskeletal, 
neurological, and gastrointestinal. Assessments of height (Screening visit only), weight, and vital 
signs (systolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and respiration) are included and 
will be done at every visit.  
 
9.4 Neurological Examination  
This examination will be performed by a medically qualified professional and includes an 
assessment of cranial nerves, strength, coordination, reflexes, sensation, tremor and gait at 
screening and week 24 visits.  
 
9.5 Electroca rdiogram (ECG ) 
A standard 12 -lead resting ECG will be performed at the screening and week 24 visits. The ECG 
report will be reviewed, signed, and dated by the investigator. Those with clinically significant 
ECG findings will be referred for follow -up as de emed appropriate by the investigator.

Phase 2 Study – Rasagiline AD Protocol  34 of 54    
Excluded participants are patients who have either:  1) Screening ECG with QTc > 450 msec if male 
or QTc > 470 msec if female; or 2) A history of additional risk factors for Torsades de Pointes 
(TdP) (e.g., hypokalemia, family history of Long QT Syndrome) or are taking drugs that are known 
to cause QT -prolongation; Patients with a prolonged QTc interval in the setting of intraventricular 
conduction block (examples right bundle branch block [RBBB] or left bund le branch block 
[LBBB], may be enrolled with sponsor approval; or 3) History of atrial fibrillation . 
 
9.6 Orthostatic Vital Signs  
Orthostatic vital signs  are a series of vital signs  of a patient taken while the patient is supine , then 
again while standing. Patient should be lying down for 3 minutes, and then  take blood pressure and 
heart rate  three times, 2 minutes apart each . Patient will be asked to stand for 3 minutes, and then  
blood pressure and heart rate will be taken  again three times, 2 minutes apart each . Results will be 
recorded in the source document.   
 
9.7  Clinical Laboratory Evaluation  
Hematology, chemistry, liver function, B12, TSH levels and urinalysis will be collected at 
Screening and Week 24 visits. Laboratory samples to be tested consist of the following:  
 
Hematology  Chemistry  Liver Function  Other Tests  
Hemoglobin  Na Albumin  TSH 
Hematocrit  K Total bilirubin  B12 
RBC  Cl Direct bilirubin  Urinalysis

Transaminase   
 
Laboratory  reports will be reviewed, signed and dated by the principal investigator. If any 
laboratory abnormalities have emerged in the course of the 24 -week clinical trial, laboratory 
measures of that test will be repeated. The investigator will determine if abnor mal values are 
clinically significant or not. If abnormalities persist, patients will be referred to their primary care 
physicians for treatment of the abnormality.  
 
Quest Diagnostics and the Cleveland Clinic Laboratory will function as the research reference 
laborator ies and will conduct all laboratory assessments.  
 
9.8 Biomarker Studies and ApoE Genotyping  
Serum biomarker measures will be collected for this study. They will include the following: Serum 
Aβ 40 and 42; sAPP -α, sAPP -β, Isoprostanes; Cy tokines and other measures relevant to AD at 
Baseline and Week 24 visits. These assays will be done by the Genomics laboratory of the 
University of Nevada Las Vegas and Cleveland Clinic .

Amendment # 5 dated 17 Feb 2017    
Phase 2 Study – Rasagiline AD Protocol  35 of 54   All participants will be asked to consent to the ApoE genotyping. DNA will be extracted from 
blood samples taken from participants and will be analyzed for ApoE genotype at the Baseline visit. 
This will permit secondary analyses of data on the impact of ApoE genotype on biomarkers of 
Alzheimer’s disease, clinical outcome  measures and adverse events. ApoE genotyping will also be 
performed by the Genomics laboratory of the University of Nevada Las Vegas and Cleveland Clinic 
using established protocols.  
 
 9.9  MRI  
A research grade (ADNI quality) MRI, acquired for each subjec t at the time of enrollment, will 
also be provided. T1, T2 and FLAIR or T2* sequence will be collected.  
3D Sagittal T1 sequence: T1 -weighted MPRAGE or MPRAGE -like sequence adhering to the 
Alzheimer ’s disease  Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) specifications.   Typical scanner sequence 
parameters that could be used include:

All scans in this study will be evaluated using a stringent quality control proce dure to ensure 
suitability for analysis.  Quality control will be performed within 3 business days of image receipt 
so that in the event of an issue, the visit may be rescheduled if issues cannot be addressed through 
re-reconstruction. Quality control step s will include header checks, visual inspection, and 
quantitative inter -frame motion measurement.  Image headers will be checked to ensure that the 
protocol was followed with regard to injected dose, injected volume,  and start  time after injection, 
number of frames, scan duration, and reconstruction parameters.  Visual inspection will include 
checks for anatomical truncation (e.g. , omission of lower slices of cerebellum), adequate image 
counts, and image  noise such as streaking , image blur indicative of subject motion, asymmetry 
indicative of misalignment between emission and transmission scan, and other apparent artifacts. 
Quantitative motion measurement will involve calculation of the inter -timeframe translation and 
rotation, with preset thresholds above which a frame (or scan, if multiple frames) will not be 
accepted as suitable for analysis.  
 
ADMdx has developed and will utilize an automated image processing pipeline, PETMAX™, 
which has secure user access, version control wi th back -up, and complete audit trail for use in 
clinical trials.  PETMAX facilitates user interaction for visual inspection and quality control at 
multiple stages in the pipeline, and streamlines the execution of the many steps (including SPM 
functions) em ployed in image preparation and analysis. Results are logged and saved under version 
control.   
 
 9.10 [18F] -FDG -PET Imaging  
  There are two FDG -PET scans to be conducted per participant in this study. The scans will be done 
at the Screening visit for study eligibility, and at Week 24 visit for end of treatment scan and 
comparison.  
 
The scanning protocol and equipment qualificatio n requirements for this study will be consistent 
with those implemented in ADNI 2 (30). FDG -PET imaging data will be obtained at two sites:  the 
Cleveland Clinic facilities in Cleveland, Ohio and Las Vegas, Nevada.  Each of these sites uses a 
Siemens Biogr aph PET/CT LSO 16 slice camera.   As part of site qualification, site practices will 
be reviewed, along with recent equipment calibration logs. If the site has a 3D -Hoffman phantom

Amendment # 5 dated 17 Feb 2017    
Phase 2 Study – Rasagiline AD Protocol  36 of 54   scan collected within the past 12 months available, the scan will be provid ed for examination.  If a 
de-identified patient brain scan can be made available, it will be provided for examination.  The 
requirements for subject management in preparation for the scan, during FDG uptake, and during 
image acquisition will be reviewed wi th staff to ensure that these can be met. Since the Cleveland 
Clinic participates in ADNI as well as numerous other clinical trials, it is anticipated that 
requirements will be met.  
 
The scanner will have an up -to-date calibration and normalization on the date of each imaging 
session.  A daily QC check will be done at the beginning of the day the scanning will be completed.  
The scan will be visually inspected for abnormalities.  If there is a possibility that the abnormality 
could impact the PET scan quali ty, the visit will be rescheduled.   
 
Daily CT quality assurance will be performed as recommended by the specific vendor, and should 
typically include a "checkup/calibration" procedure and a water phantom scan. The 
checkup/calibration procedure guarantees optimum image quality by warming up the x -ray tube 
and should be performed at startup and within 1 hour prior to any scan. The water phantom provides 
quality measurements of 3 parameters. The parameters are the CRT value of water calculated in 
Hounsfield u nits (HU), the pixel noise of images calculated as a standard deviation, and the tube 
voltages measured directly on the x -ray tubes. These three measurements should be determined for 
all available kVp values.  
 
Ideally, no hardware or software upgrades of t he PET imaging system will occur during the study 
duration.  If an upgrade needs to occur, ADMdx will be informed prior to the anticipated upgrade.  
Depending on the nature of the upgrade the site may be asked to repeat the phantom scans prior to 
scanning any additional subjects.   
 
Quality control of blood glucose meter will be performed according to the manufacturer’s or 
institution’s procedure to ensure proper functioning.  Quality control of dose calibrator will be 
performed throughout the course of the  study. This typically will include daily constancy, quarterly 
linearity and annual accuracy.  
 
9.11 18F-AV-1451  Tau PET Imaging  
At Screening visit, subjects who qualify for the study will come to the imaging center at a later date 
and will have a catheter  placed for IV administration of 18F -AV-1451. Vital signs will be taken in 
a supine  position immediately prior to administration of 18F -AV-1451 (within 30 minutes prior to 
injection)  and at the completion of imaging prior to subject discharge. Subjects wil l receive up to 
a target  dose of 370 mBq as a single IV bolus of 18F -AV-1451. A 20 minute dynamic image starting  
approximately 80 minutes post injection will be obtained. With sponsor approval sites may elect  
an alternative imaging protocol (i.e. different  duration or start time) with additional time points.  
 
All datasets will be submitted to AVID Radiopharmaceuticals  for analysis.  
 
Adverse events will be continuously monitored during the imaging session. Subjects who  
experience any adverse event will not be discharged until the event has resolved or stabilized.  
 
The 18F-AV-1451  Tau PET imaging will also be performed  within 30 days of  Week 24/End of 
Treatment Visit .

A follow -up phone call to the subject, or designated decision maker, will be conducted between 2  
and 3 business days after  18F-AV-1451  imaging day, but not before 48 hours post -injection, to 
confirm subject wellbeing  and to collect information about any new adverse events. If both of these 
days are not  business days,  the follow -up phone call can occur the following business day.  
A companion protocol for the non -optional  18F-AV-1451  PET imagin g study  provides detailed 
information regarding the 18F-AV-1451 component and study procedures.  
 
10. Potential Risks  
 
 10.1 Rasagiline Treatment  Risk  
The principal side effects observed in clinical trials in patients with PD include dyskinesia, nausea, 
falls, weight loss, constipation, postural hypertension, arthralgia, vomiting, abdominal pain, 
anorexia, and abnormal dreams.   
 
Drug -drug interactions are historically a concern with MAO inhibitors, particularly tyramine -rich 
foods and beverages.  Although such interactions have not been problematic in patients with 
selective MAO -B inhibitors, foods with particularly high concent rations of tyramine (aged cheese, 
sauerkraut, sausage, pickled herring) will be avoided in the course of the study.  Similarly, 
sympathomimetic agents will also be avoided in trial participants.   
 
The most significant drawback to the use of nonselective M AOIs is the risk of hypertensive 
emergencies, which can occur when a patient is exposed to sympathomimetic drugs, foods 
containing tyramine, or dopamine. By blocking the effects of MAO in the gastrointestinal tract, 
catecholamine concentrations are increas ed; and, in extreme cases, a hypertensive crisis can 
potentially result in a cerebrovascular accident or death.  
 
The potential for tyramine interaction with rasagiline (doses tested, 0.5 -2 mg) was assessed in 5 
placebo -controlled clinical trials in healthy  volunteers and PD patients. The results of the formal 
tyramine studies indicate that rasagiline can be used safely without dietary tyramine restriction at 
a dose of 1 mg/day. These data allowed removal of the dietary tyramine restriction from the 
rasagili ne. This information was taken from the package insert of Azilect.  
 
 10.2 MRI Risk  
The risks of MRI primarily arise from the possible introduction of ferromagnetic objects into a high 
magnetic field, which can create a dangerous projectile or lead to dysfu nction or heating of an 
implanted medical device. All participants will be rigorously screened by MRI personnel to be 
certain that they do not have any medical contraindications for MRI, which include metallic foreign 
bodies in the brain or eye or cardiac pacemaker. There is a slight risk of anxiety due to 
claustrophobia. Any participant who experiences anxiety when placed into the MR scanner will be 
removed from the scanner, offered reassurance by the MR tech doing the scan, and offered the 
option of conti nuing or terminating the scan. If the participant decides that the anxiety associated 
with MRI is uncomfortable for them and they wish to terminate the scan, then the examination will 
be ended at that time. There will be no attempt to coerce participants t o complete exams that they 
are uncomfortable with. Use of anxiolytic agents for completion of MRI scans is at the discretion 
of the principal investigator.

Amendment # 5 dated 17 Feb 2017    
Phase 2 Study – Rasagiline AD Protocol  38 of 54   10.3 [ 18F] -FDG -PET Scan Risk  
The primary risk related to PET is that of radiation exposure associated with the CT scan or 
transmission scan and the injected radiotracers. There is also minor risk associated with the 
venipuncture and radioisotope injection (pain and bruising or painful infiltration of a failed 
injection). The radiation dose is no t expected to produce any harmful effects, although there is no 
known minimum level of radiation exposure considered to be totally free of the risk of causing 
genetic defects or cancer. The risk associated with the amount of radiation exposure participants  
receive in this study is considered low and comparable to everyday risks. No PET studies will be 
performed on pregnant or potentially pregnant women, as the protocol requires female subjects to 
be postmenopausal as a condition of participation.  
 
10.4 CT Scan Risk                                                                                                                             
Subjects will also receive radiation of approximately 1 mSv from a “low dose” computed  
tomography (CT) acquired al ong with each PET scan.  The low -dose CT will be used to align the 
position of the subject’s head for the PET image.  The radiation dose from 1 combined PET/CT is 
about 8 mSv which is significantly less than the dose considered safe by the National Institu te of 
Health  (NIH)  for research studies.  However , this study will have 2 combined PET/CT scans during 
the study.  
 
10.5 18F-AV-1451 Tau PET Scan Risk  
18F-AV-1451  will be administered IV up to a radioactive target dose of 370 MBq with a maximum 
human mass dose (MHD) limited to 20 μg of compound by weight. This dose is 150 fold lower 
than the NOAEL observed in the rat single dose toxicity study and is 50 fold lower than the NOAEL 
observed in the rat and dog repeat dose toxicity studies.  
 
Human dosimetry has been obtained in nine subjects. The results estimated an Effective Dose of 
8.92 mSv for an anticipated 370 MBq (10 mCi) injection and is comparable to the effecti ve dose 
of approved 18F -labeled compounds such as FDG and florbetapir F 18 injection.  
 
The proposed dose has been shown to be well tolerated and to have acceptable image quality in 
preliminary human studies.  
 
       10.6 Radiation Risk                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
One of the risks associated with radiation exposure is cancer.  The natural incidence of getting 
cancer in the United States is about 40%.  In this research study, including  the companion protocol 
there will be four PET scans : FDG  PET scan at Screening and at Week 24; and 18F-AV-1451 TAU 
PET scan at Screening and at Week 24 .  The annual radiation dose from the combined 2 FDG 
PET/CT scans is 16 mSv.  The annual radiation dose from the combined 2 18F -AV-1451/CT scans 
is 19.84 mSv.  The total radiation exposure for the four Pet Scans is 35.84 mSv.  The maximum 
exposure allowed is 50 mSv per year.   
 
10.7  Placebo Risk  
Certain research participants in this study will receive a placebo.  Taking a placebo may be similar 
to not taking any medication.  Research participants who receive a placebo may have the disease 
stay the same or get worse, or the disease/condition may sp ontaneously get better just as it may 
have done without additional treatment.   
 
 10.8   Blood Draw Risk  
The risks of blood draw include pain from the needle  stick, bruising or infection at the site of 
venipuncture, or fainting as a response to blood draw.

Phase 2 Study – Rasagiline AD Protocol  39 of 54    
 
11. STATISTICAL PLAN  
11.1     Sample Size Determination  
A study population of 25 subjects per arm (placebo, drug) has been estimated to be sufficient to 
detect a significant drug effect. Further, depending upon the effect size, a study population of 12 
subjects per arm, assessed using an interim analysis, may a lso be sufficient to demonstrate 
effect.  The number of subjects required to detect a significant change in regional cerebral glucose 
metabolism depends upon the drug action, patient variability within the regions affected, and the 
methods used to measure changes in glucose metabolism.   For drugs causing a symptomatic effect, 
with or without additional disease -modifying properties, the N required is lower than that required 
to detect a modification to the rate of decline associated with disease.   Specifical ly, we have 
modeled the number of subjects required to detect 5% and 10% increases in prefrontal cortex in 
mild to moderate AD patients using a region of interest approach, and have also confirmed 
estimates through review of published effect sizes from stu dies of donepezil, phenserine, and 
galantamine in AD patients.    
 
11.2     Statistical Methods  
Intent -to-Treat ( ITT) - The primary FDG analysis will include all patients who received both a 
screening and end of study scan of acceptable quality. The primary clinical analysis will be a 
modified Intent -to-Treat (m ITT) approach including all patients randomized and receiving a t least 
one post -baseline assessment.  
Per-Protocol (PP) population – All Intent -to-Treat subjects who complete the study (Week 24) and 
have ingested between 80% and 120% of the protocol prescribed study medication as measured by 
pill count.  
Observed case – An observe d case analysis of all patients completing the study will be conducted.  
LOCF – Clinical data imputation will use the LOCF approach for missing patients  
Responder analysis – Responders will be defined as those that have a significant improvement on 
brain metabolism on FDG for the whole brain or for any of the pre -specified regions.  
A secondary analysis will compare the changes in FDG at 6 months compared to the projected 
expected metabolism based on the Baseline FDG findings.  
 
11.3 Subject  Populations for Analysis  
With a subject population of 10 patients per arm (placebo and treatment), Kadir et al detected a 
significant increase (p<0.05) in frontal, parietal, and parietotemporal glucose metabolism within 
the treatment group, and a signific ant difference between placebo and treatment arms in 
parietotemporal glucose metabolism (26).   The percent changes associated with these increases 
ranged from 5.5% to 8%.   In two different studies of donepezil (27 , 28), the change in glucose 
metabolism was  measured in subjects who improved, rather than declined, in cognitive 
scores.   Using region of interest analysis, Shimadai found significant differences (p<0.05) in frontal 
regions when comparing the ratio of pre -treatment to post -treatment in 7 responder s with regard to 
ADAS -J cog score to that of 4 non -responders. Using voxel -based analyses, Mega et al found a 
significant difference in anterior cingulate, prefrontal cortex, and parietotemporal cortex between

Amendment # 5 dated 17 Feb 2017    
Phase 2 Study – Rasagiline AD Protocol  40 of 54   6 cognitive responders as compared to similar untreated subjects, even after applying a Bonferroni 
correction for random effects.  
 
Evaluation of the FDG PET scans of 70 mild AD subjects from the Alzheimer’s Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database indicates that, based upon mean and standard de viation 
of glucose metabolism in prefrontal cortex, a change in mean Standardized Uptake Value ratio 
(SUVr) of 5% could be statistically significant between two independent groups (drug, placebo) at 
70% power (p<0.05, two -tailed) with 26 subjects per arm, or at 80% power with 32 subjects per 
arm.  The number of subjects required reduces quickly with effect, as a change of 10% would 
require only 8 subjects per arm to achieve 80% power if variance within the study group is 
comparable to that within the mild A D ADNI population (greater variance would increase the 
number of subjects required or decrease the power).   Region of interest evaluation is typically more 
conservative than voxel -based analysis because effects common across subjects often involve sub -
regions and measurement of change may be diluted by the use of broader pre -determined 
measurement areas.   Use of voxel -based approaches, and in addition, multivariate methods and a 
pattern -based classification approach, are expected to increase statistical pow er as they improve the 
signal to noise ratio and are not limited to predefined regions.  
 
11.4 FDG PET Imaging Analysis  
 
11.4.1. Screening Classification  
The Screening FDG PET scan of each subject will be evaluated using ADMdx’s dementia 
classifier, to assess whether the subject expresses a pattern consistent with AD or alternatively, that 
of other dementias. The classifier has developed machine learning me thods and a comprehensive 
set of reference data from ADNI and other sources.  The FDG PET scan of a subject will be 
independently compared to a set of canonical variant patterns that in combination characterize the 
patterns of relative hypometabolism cause d by different types of dementia. A probability will be 
assigned to determine whether the subject is “AD -like” or better characterized as a different 
dementia.  
 
In addition, hypometabolism will be assessed in frontal cortex and occipital cortex, and parie tal 
asymmetry checked, to identify possible atypical or comorbid presentations that may impact 
clinical attributes.  The AD -like or non -AD-like status of each subject will be reported back within 
7 days of image receipt to allow enrollment decisions.  
 
11.4.2   Screening Characterization  
The Screening FDG PET scan of each subject will be evaluated using ADMdx’s AD Progression 
classifier, to assess the subject’s disease -related hypometabolism status relative to reference 
subjects and other study subjects. The  FDG PET scan of a subject will be independently compared 
to a set of canonical variant patterns that in combination characterize the patterns of relative 
hypometabolism caused by different stages of progression toward AD dementia. This numeric 
score will be used to project likely cognitive trajectory for comparison to actual results. It can also 
be used to stratify groups for sub -analyses, creating more homogeneous analysis groups at baseline.  
11.4.3   Longitudinal Voxel -based Evaluation  
The spatially norm alized longitudinal FDG PET scans of each subject will be analyzed using 
ADMdx’s NPAIRS multivariate software.  Classes will be defined according to treatment or 
placebo condition, and visit.  Example analyses are shown in Table 1 below.  The output of thi s

metabolism, quantification of the placement of each subject at each time point relative to these 
patterns of effect, and quantification of the contributi on of each pattern to the overall effect.  Metrics 
of reproducibility and predictive power are also provided.  At preference of Sponsor, group 
assignments may be provided in a blinded manner – that is, Group A and Group B, without 
designation as treatment or placebo.  In the table below, to better illustrate the comparisons, they 
are referred to as Placebo and Treatment, but these may instead be “Group A” and “Group B .”

SPM -t contrasts will also be performed of selected groups, at thresholds of p<0.005, and a cluster 
extent threshold of 25 voxels. These are limited to paired contrasts (e.g. , baseline vs. 6 months for 
treatment group), or to contrasts of the difference images between baseline and 6 months, treatment 
vs. placebo groups.  Informa tion is more limited with regard to individual subject distribution other 
than at specific voxel locations.  
11.4.4   Longitudinal Region of Interest Evaluation  
The SUVr calculated for each subject will be compared using t -tests, within groups and across 
groups, as shown in Table 4 below. While the pre -identified reference regions for testing will be 
whole brain, cerebellum, and pons, an alternate reference region may be identified through the use 
of NPAIRS multivariate analysis and applied.

12. SAFETY AND ADVERSE EVENTS  
12.1 Definitions  
International Conference o n Harmoni sation (ICH) guidelines define an adverse event ( AE) as any 
medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical 
product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An 
AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unin tended sign (including an abnormal laboratory 
finding, for example) symptom, or disease temporarily associated with the use of a medicinal 
product whether or not considered related to this medicinal product.  
A serious adverse event  (SAE) is any medical occ urrence or effect that at any dose:  
 Results in death  
 Is life threatening  
 Requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing inpatient hospitalization  
 Results in persistent or a significant disability or incapacity  
 Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect  
 Is cancer

Amendment # 5 dated 17 Feb 2017    
Phase 2 Study – Rasagiline AD Protocol  43 of 54    Life threatening in the definition of a SAE refers to an event in which the subject was at 
risk of death at the time of event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might 
have caused death if it were more severe.  
 
      12.2  Recording of Adverse Events  
At each contact with the subject, the investigator will seek information on AEs by specific 
questioning and, as appropriate, by examination. Information on all adverse events will be recorded 
immediately in the source document,  and also in the appropriate AE section of the case report form 
(CRF).  All clearly related signs, symptoms, and abnormal diagnostic procedures results will also 
be recorded in the source document.  
The clinical course of each event will be followed until resolution, stabilization, or until it has been 
determined that the study treatment or participation is not the cause. Serious adverse events that are 
still ongoing at the end of the study period will be followed up to determine the final outcome. Any 
SAE that occurs after the study period and is considered to be possibly related to the study treatment 
or study participation will be recorded and reported immediately.  
 
12.3 Reporting of Serious Adverse Events  
12.3.1  Study Sponsor -Investigator Notification by  Investigator  
A SAE will be reported to the study sponsor -investigator by telephone within 24 hours of the 
event. A SAE form will be completed by the investigator and faxed to the study sponsor 
within 24 hours. The investigator will keep a copy of this SA E form on file at the study site. 
Report a SAE by phone and facsimile to Michelle Sholar, 702 -483-6026, fax 702 -483-6028.  
At the time of the initial report the following information will be provided:  
 Study identifier  
 Study Center  
 Subject number  
 A description of the event  
 Date of onset  
 Current status  
 Whether study treatment was discontinued  
 The reason event is classified as serious  
 Investigator assessment of the association between the event and study treatment  
 
Within the following 48 hours, the in vestigator will provide further information on the AE 
in the form of a written narrative. This will include a copy of the completed SAE form and 
any other diagnostic information that will assist the understanding of the event.  Significant 
new information on ongoing SAEs will be provided promptly to the study sponsor -
investigator.  
 
12.3.2  IRB Notification by Investigator  
Reports of all SAEs (including follow -up information) will be submitted to the Cleveland 
Clinic Foundation (CCF) IRB per the guidelines of the CCF IRB Standard Operating 
Procedures. Copies of each report and documentation of IRB notification and response will 
be filed in the regulatory binder.  
The following four types of events will be reported to the IRB (these follow the Case Cancer 
IRB because this is an anti -cancer agent being used in patients with mild to moderate AD):

Amendment # 5 dated 17 Feb 2017    
Phase 2 Study – Rasagiline AD Protocol  44 of 54   1.  Adverse events which are serious, unexpected, and related or possibly related to 
participation in the research.  
2.  Serious adverse events that are expected in som e subjects, but are determined to be 
occurring at a significantly higher frequency or severity than expected.  
3.  Other unexpected adverse events, regardless of severity, that may alter IRB analysis of 
the risk versus potential benefit of the research and, as a result, warrant consideration of 
substantive changes in the research protocol or informed consent process/document.  
4.  Unanticipated problems  involving risks to subjects or others or any serious or continuing 
noncompliance with this policy or the requirements or determinations of the IRB.  
 
12.3.3  FDA Notification by Sponsor -Investigator  
The FDA will be notified by telephone or by facsimile transmission of any unexpected fatal 
or life threatening experience associated with the use of the drug as soon as possible, but no 
later than seven calendar days from original receipt of the information.  
If a previous adverse  event that was not initially deemed reportable is later found to fit the 
criteria for reporting, the study sponsor -investigator will submit the adverse event in a written 
report to the FDA as soon as possible, but no later than 15 calendar days from the t ime the 
determination is made.  
 
12.4   Unblinding  Procedures  
The research coordinator will inform the sponsor -investigator of all subjects whose treatment 
was unblinded within 24 hours of unblinding. Most unblinding will be part of managing a 
SAE and will be reported with the SAE. Unblinding that was not associated with a SAE will 
be reported in a timely manner. This will be done within 24 hours by telephone or facsimile, 
and will be followed by a written narrative of the reason for unblinding within 24 hou rs of 
the event.  
      
 12.5   Stopping Rules  
If 4 or more patients worsen clinically in a manner greater than expected for untreated AD, the 
protocol will be stopped.  Similarly , if 4 or more patients show ARIA -E or microhemorrhages 
on the 2nd MRI, the protocol will be stopped.  
   
 12.6  Medical Monitoring  
The principal investigator will oversee the safety of patients in the rasagiline study. The safety 
monitoring will include careful assessment and appropriate reporting of adverse events as noted 
above as well as the construction and implementation of a site data and safety monitoring plan. 
Medical monitoring will include a re gular assessment of the number and type of SAEs. Medical 
monitoring for the trial would be done by Charles Bernick , MD, of the Lou Ruvo Center for Brain 
Health.  
  
12.6.1    Internal Data Safety Monitoring Board  (DSMB)  
A data safety monitoring committee is  not deemed necessary for this fifty -patient initial            study 
of rasagiline.

The scanning protocol and equipment qualification requirements for this study will be consistent with  those 
implemented in ADNI 2 (30). FDG -PET imaging data will be obtained at two sites:  the Cleveland Clinic 
facilities in Cleveland, Ohio and Las Vegas, Nevada.  Each of these sites uses a Siemens Biograph PET/CT 
LSO 16 slice camera.   As part of site qua lification, site practices will be reviewed, along with recent 
equipment calibration logs. If the site has a 3D -Hoffman phantom scan collected within the past 12 months 
available, the scan will be provided for examination.  If a de -identified patient brain  scan can be made 
available, it will be provided for examination.  The requirements for subject management in preparation for 
the scan, during FDG uptake, and during image acquisition will be reviewed with staff to ensure that these 
can be met. Since the C leveland Clinic participates in ADNI as well as numerous other clinical trials, it is 
anticipated that requirements will be met.  
 
The scanner will have an up -to-date calibration and normalization on the date of each imaging session.  A 
daily QC check will be done at the beginning of the day the scanning will be completed.  The scan will be 
visually inspected for abnormalities.  If there is a possibility that the abnormality could impact the PET 
scan quality, the visit will be rescheduled.   
Daily CT quality  assurance will be performed as recommended by the specific vendor, and should typically 
include a "checkup/calibration" procedure and a water phantom scan. The checkup/calibration procedure 
guarantees optimum image quality by warming up the x -ray tube and  should be performed at startup and 
within 1 hour prior to any scan. The water phantom provides quality measurements of 3 parameters. The 
parameters are the CRT value of water calculated in Hounsfield units (HU), the pixel noise of images 
calculated as a s tandard deviation, and the tube voltages measured directly on the x -ray tubes. These three 
measurements should be determined for all available kVp values.  
 
Ideally, no hardware or software upgrades of the PET imaging system will occur during the study dura tion.  
If an upgrade needs to occur, ADMdx will be informed prior to the anticipated upgrade.  Depending on the 
nature of the upgrade the site may be asked to repeat the phantom scans prior to scanning any additional 
subjects.  
   
Quality control of blood glucose meter will be performed according to the manufacturer’s or institution’s 
procedure to ensure proper functioning.  Quality control of dose calibrator will be performed throughout 
the course of the study. This typically will include daily constancy, quarterly linearity and annual accuracy.

Phase 2 Study – Rasagiline AD Protocol  50 of 54   2)  Image Data Collection  
(i). Pre -Scan Subject Preparation  
All participants will be screened by study personnel for contraindications to PET scanning (see Exclusion 
Criteria).  Scans should be scheduled at the same  time of day for a given subject – i.e., if in the morning for 
the baseline scan, then in the morning for any subsequent scans.  In order to reduce the potential for first 
scan effects, prior to the first scan, for example at the Screening visit, each subj ect will be introduced to the 
PET scanner, sequence of data acquisition events, and FDG uptake room and activity.  
 
Subjects to be imaged in the morning are asked to omit all food and fluids (except water) from midnight 
the night before the scan until after  the imaging is completed. Subjects scanned later in the day are asked 
to omit food and fluids (except water) for at least 4 hours prior to the imaging session.  When a participant 
arrives at the imaging center, compliance with the dietary requirement of n ot having food or drink in less 
than two hours will be confirmed.  If a participant has ingested food or drink within two hours, participants 
will wait until two hours have elapsed.  Once two hours have elapsed, blood glucose levels will be 
measured.  If b lood glucose levels are not less than 180 mg/dL, then waiting an additional amount of time 
to recheck blood glucose levels will be needed.  Once blood glucose levels are below 180 mg/dL, the 
participant will be asked to use the restroom to empty his/her bl adder.  Then, the participant will be asked 
to sit or recline comfortably (but not in a position that will induce sleep) in a reclining chair in a room in 
which the ambient noise is minimal and the degree of lighting can be controlled and minimized.  
Blank ets/pillows may be supplied as needed to maximize comfort.  Intravenous access using a small 
butterfly needle or angiocath will be done.  185 MBq (5mCI +/ - 10%) of [18F] -FDG will be drawn and 
assayed with a dose calibrator and assay time will be recorded t o the nearest minute.  The [18F] -FDG will 
be injected and the syringe and IV line will be flushed with 10mL of normal saline.  The injection time will 
be recorded to the nearest minute and the IV line may be discontinued.  The dose syringe will then be re -
assayed and if the residual activity is 0.1 mCi or greater, the amount will be recorded and the amount of the 
injected dose will be corrected for the residual activity.   
(ii)  Subject Management During FDG Uptake  
Control of the subject’s activity and envi ronment during the 30 minutes following tracer administration is 
essential. It is also necessary that the subjects’ position during the uptake period, their activity and focus, 
their visual, audio, and temperature environment, and the room’s ambient light conditions are consistent 
across all longitudinal scans.  
 
The subject will be asked to rest comfortably in the room with lights dimmed to a level similar to twilight 
for 30 minutes for incorporation of [18F] -FDG in the brain. The subject’s eyes will be ope n, away from 
any direct light, and the ears will remain un -occluded.  The participant will be directed to maintain their 
gaze on a constant object throughout the uptake period.  This point of focus (object) should be the same 
across subjects and across sca ns. The subject should also be instructed to avoid any motion, foot tapping, 
or other variable activity. Comfort should be assured in order to reduce the likelihood of movement. The 
participant must be monitored frequently to be certain of compliance and t o ensure that the eyes do not 
close and they remain awake.  It is important that no sudden noises or environmental changes occur within 
or just outside of the participant’s room during [18F] -FDG uptake.  
 
Just prior to injection, and at the end of the uptake period, the subject will be asked to answer a short set of 
questions regarding their affect.  The clinician will also be asked to note the subject’s affect, and particularly 
whether the subject exhibits  signs of agitation, somnolence, or depression. These observations are important 
because differences between scanning sessions in the patient’s affect can impact measured signal, creating 
confounds in the measurement of treatment effects. If a subject is n otably agitated, the process should not

Phase 2 Study – Rasagiline AD Protocol  51 of 54   begin until that agitation can be alleviated.  If this is not reasonably achievable, the scan should be 
rescheduled.  
 
At the end of the 30 -minute incorporation period, the participant will be encouraged to use the re stroom to 
empty their bladder.  Ample time will be given to ensure that the participant will be on the scanner and 
ready for data acquisition to begin at 30 minutes post -injection.   
(iii)  Image Acquisition  
The participant will be positioned and secured i n the scanner.  Proper participant positioning and the 
prevention of subject motion during acquisition is critical for a reliable PET scan.  Excessive motion 
between the emission scan and the CT scan used for attenuation correction is the single most commo n cause 
of failed studies.  For this reason, the protocol includes several steps to reduce the likelihood of movement, 
as follows, and consistent with ADNI guidelines.  
 
Time will be taken to ensure the participant is properly positioned and can comfortably  maintain that 
position for 30 minutes during the scanning session.  Participants will remove any bulky items from their 
pockets and remove eyeglasses, earrings, hair clips/combs, and hearing aids (if possible).  The participant 
will be positioned so the h ead/neck is relaxed which may involve adding additional pads beneath the neck 
to provide sufficient support.  It will be verified that the participant’s ears are in a comfortable position, and 
not pinched, as this can cause movement to alleviate discomfort  during the scan. Lasers will be used to 
ensure that there is little or no rotation in either plane.  The head will be positioned parallel to the imaginary 
line between the external canthus of the eye and the external auditory meatus.  Supportive devices u nder 
the back and/or legs will be used to help decrease the strain on these regions and prevention motion in the 
lower body.  Once the participant is positioned, foam pads may be placed alongside the head for additional 
support.  Velcro straps and preferab ly easily removed tape will be used to secure the head position.  Vacuum 
bean bags may also be used in this process.  One of the most common forms of motion in PET scans is a 
downward motion that causes the subject’s head to move lower in the field of view , ultimately truncating 
the lower portion of cerebellum from view.  To minimize the possibility of this, a (comfortable) “rod” or 
other device may ideally be positioned just below the chin, serving as a reminder to the subject not to move 
downward. The sub ject will be offered a “panic button” or be reassured that someone will be watching or 
able to hear them at all times.   
 
Prior to initiation of the emission scan, a short “scout” scan is to be taken in order to verify that the subject’s 
head is correctly positioned.  
 
The subject’s head position and ability to remain still must be monitored continuously throughout the 
acquisition period. If the subject moves, acquisition should cease, the head should be repositioned, the time 
at which the repositioning occurred noted, and acquisition resumed.  It is imperative that if motion occurs 
between frames, the emission frames are correctly aligned with one another, and with the transmission scan, 
before attenuation correction is applied through the use of a trans mission scan. The handling of motion will 
be a topic for discussion with PET technologist and depends upon the scanner model and options available.  
 
A 30 -minute dynamic, 3D scan consisting of six 5 -minute frames (preferably ten 3 -minute frames to allow 
for additional motion correction) will be acquired <to be verified as ADNI has indicated that Siemens 
Biograph scanners cannot collect dynamic images>.  All images will need to be corrected using measured 
attenuation using standard CT acquisition parameters.  A check will be performed to ensure that the 
emission and transmission scans are properly aligned before the participant leaves the imaging session. 
Upon completion, the participant is to be removed from the scanner and encouraged to void.  The study 
participant will be instructed to drink fluids and to void throughout the day to help reduce radiation 
exposure.

Amendment # 5 dated 17 Feb 2017    
Phase 2 Study – Rasagiline AD Protocol  52 of 54   (iv).   Image Reconstruction  
Images will be reconstructed using parameters specific to the scanning system and will be reviewed to 
check for artifa cts and motion.  Sinogram data (projection data) will be stored in a separate file.  Iterative 
reconstruction will be performed, using the parameters recommended by ADNI for the scanner model [ref].  
(v).   Image De -identification and Transfer  
The PET imag e sets produced by the reconstruction process will be converted to a standard Digital Imaging 
and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) file format.  Image file naming will follow a standard format 
so that all scans can be easily identified.  The file ID will  be assigned by study personnel prior to the PET 
scan.  Unless designated otherwise during study preparations, the naming convention will be XXX_S_#### 
where XXX is a three digit site ID determined by the Cleveland Clinic and #### is the unique four digit 
number assigned to the subject by the site, followed by a sequence uniquely identifying the scan.   
 
All raw and processed study data including copies of the normalization and blank scans will be archived.  
Image data will be transferred to ADMdx (Chicago,  IL), as soon as images have been acquired and 
reconstructed.  A secure image transfer program such as AG Mednet that ensures de -identification of the 
data prior to transmission will be employed.  Initial header checks may be performed using that software 
prior to image transmission.  
2)  MRI Scan  
A research grade (ADNI quality) MRI, acquired for each subject at the time of enrollment, will also be 
provided. T1, T2 and FLAIR or T2* sequence will be collected.  
 
3D Sagittal T1 sequence: T1 -weighted MPRAGE or MPRAGE -like sequence adhering to the Alzheimer’s 
disease  Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) specifications.   Typical scanner sequence parameters that could 
be used include:

(i)  Image Quality Control  
All scans in this study will be evaluated using a stringent quality control procedure to ensure suitability for 
analysis.  Quality control will be performed within 3 business days of image receipt so that in the event of 
an issue, the visit may be reschedu led if issues cannot be addressed through re -reconstruction. Quality 
control steps will include header checks, visual inspection, and quantitative inter -frame motion 
measurement.  Image headers will be checked to ensure that the protocol was followed with regard to 
injected dose, injected volume, and start  time after injection, number of frames, scan duration, and 
reconstruction parameters.  Visual inspection will include checks for anatomical truncation (e.g. omission 
of lower slices of cerebellum), adequate image counts, image noise such as streaking, ima ge blur indicative 
of subject motion, asymmetry indicative of misalignment between emission and transmission scan, and 
other apparent artifacts. Quantitative motion measurement will involve calculation of the inter -timeframe 
translation and rotation, with preset thresholds above which a frame (or scan, if multiple frames) will not 
be accepted as suitable for analysis.  
 
ADMdx has developed and will utilize an automated image processing pipeline, PETMAX™, which has 
secure user access, version control with ba ck-up, and complete audit trail for use in clinical trials.  PETMAX 
facilitates user interaction for visual inspection and quality control at multiple stages in the pipeline, and

Phase 2 Study – Rasagiline AD Protocol  53 of 54   streamlines the execution of the many steps (including SPM functions) employe d in image preparation and 
analysis. Results are logged and saved under version control.   
(ii)  Image Processing  
Discrete timeframes for each scan will be aligned and an aggregate image created by averaging the frames. 
Each subject’s MRI will be co -regist ered to the baseline PET scan, and longitudinal PET scans will be co -
registered to the baseline PET scan, as well.  The MRI will be segmented into gray, white, and CSF tissue 
images. The MRI will be spatially transformed to a target template and the PET sc an(s) will be likewise 
transformed using the same parameters.  The spatially transformed images will be intensity normalized to 
a mean value of 1, and smoothing applied to achieve uniform resolution with other scanners for comparison 
to reference data and use in the dementia classifiers.  A set of template ROIs will be transformed back to 
the subject’s native (unwrapped) brain for signal measurement in unwrapped space, with individualized 
masking applied using the subject’s gray matter segment. The mean, st andard deviation, minimum, and 
maximum for each ROI will be measured, as well as those in different reference regions for comparison, 
including whole brain without ventricles, cerebellum, and pons. This is in order to examine consistency 
across reference r egions, and to determine whether treatment effects may influence one or more reference 
regions as well as target ROIs. Standardized Uptake Value Ratios (SUVrs) will be generated by taking the 
ratio of regions of interest to the respective reference regions .

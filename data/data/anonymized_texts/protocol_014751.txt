Name of Finished Product: Miconazole oil  
Name of Active Ingredient: 2% miconazole  
Study Title:  
Dose -Ranging Study of the Efficacy and Safety of Miconazole Oil Used for 7 or 14 Day 
Compared with Vehicle in the Treatment of Otomycosis  
Study Number:  HD-MCZ -PHII-DRF062016  
Study Center(s):  Up to 10 study centers in the United States (US)  
Number of Subjects Planned:  Approximately 75 
Study Period: 
The study duration for each subject will be up to 30 days (up to 14 days of treatment, and 8 
days of follow -up, including the visit window of up to 8 additional days after the scheduled day 
to complete the final visit)  
Phase of Development:  2 
Objectives:  
• Obtain preliminary evidence of the efficacy and safety of miconazole oil compared with vehicle over a 14-day treatment duration 
• Descri ptively compare the efficacy and safety of miconazole oil over 7 versus 14 days  
Design and Methodology:  
This study is a randomized, partially masked, multiple-dose, parallel -group design study 
conducted at up to 10 study centers in the US. Approximately 75 male or female subjects with 
otomycosis will receive study drug. Subjects will be randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to 
receive miconazole oil [administered as 5 drops per ear at ~30 mg per drop instilled into the 
external ear canal of the ear(s) affected by otomycosis] for 7 or 14 days, or vehicle for 14 days. 
During the study it is planned to assess  treatment allocation  to ensure that there is  a sufficient 
number of subjects within each group for the primary analysis. If deemed necessary, future 
randomizations may be adjusted. For subjects assigned to the 14-day treatment duration with 
either miconazole oil or vehicle, the contents of the study drug will be masked to both the subject and the investigator and study staff (i.e., double-blind), but the treatment duration 
assigned to each subject (7 or 14 days) will be unmasked to both the subject and the 
investigator and study staff.  
At Screening/Baseline (Day 1), potentially eligible subjects will provide informed consent, and 
subjects will undergo screening evaluations to include a physical examination, an assessment 
of the signs and symptoms of otomycosis (pruritus, debris, visual examination for presence of fungal elements, and pain), and an evaluation of medical history. Urine will be obtained for pregnancy screening in female subjects of childbearing potential. Prior and concomitant 
medications will be reported. Subjects with positive signs and symptoms of otomycosis and 
who meet all other eligibility criteria will be entered into the study, and a subject global assessment of disease will be performed. Fungal and bacterial cultures of the affected ear(s) will be taken, then debris will be cleaned from the affected ear(s) following the site’s normal procedures. The subject will then begin treatment with study drug. The subject or caregiver will 
instill the first dose of study drug at the site, under the supervision of the investigator or site personnel. Adverse events (AEs) will then be assessed. The subject will then leave the clinic and continue to administer the study drug twice per day as instructed. Subjects will be 
instructed to avoid getting water in the ear, to consider drying excessive water in the ear by

using a blow dryer, and to place a Vaseline -impregnated cotton ball over the affected e ar(s) to 
help keep water out of the ear while bathing or showering. 
 
All subjects will return to the clinic on Day 8. For subjects randomized to the 7-day treatment 
duration, this visit will constitute the End of Treatment Visit, with procedures performed as 
described for that visit below. Subjects randomized to 7-day treatment will not administer study 
drug on Day 8. For all other subjects, for whom this visit will constitute an On Treatment Visit, a 
clinical evaluation of the signs and symptoms of otomycosis, a subject global assessment, a cleaning of the affected ear(s) (following the site’s normal procedures), and an assessment of 
AEs and concomitant medications will be performed, and these subjects will continue to 
administer the study drug twice per day, up through Day 14, following the same instructions as provided at the Screening/Baseline Visit on Day 1. 
All subjects will return to the clinic on Day 15. For subjects randomized to the 7-day treatment 
duration, this visit will constitute the Test of Cu
re Visit, with procedures performed as described 
for the Test of Cure Visit below. For subjects randomized to the 14-day treatment duration, this 
visit will constitute the End of Treatment Visit, with procedures performed as described for the 
End of Treatment Visit below. 
Subjects randomized to the 14-day treatment durations will return to the clinic on Day 22, for 
the Test of Cure Visit, with procedures performed as described for the Test of Cure Visit below.  
Procedures performed at the End of Treatment Visit will include an assessment for clinical 
signs and symptoms of otomycosis, a subject global assessment, and a fungal culture of the 
affected ear(s). For subjects randomized to the 7 -day treatment duration, subjects will have the 
affected ear(s) cleaned according to the site’s normal procedures at this visit, after the efficacy 
procedures have been completed. AEs and concomitant medications will also be assessed, and the subject will return all unused study drug. 
Procedures performed at the Test of Cure Visit will include an assessment of clinical signs and 
symptoms of otomycosis, a subject global assessment, and a fungal culture of the affected 
ear(s). AEs and concomitant medications will also be assessed. A urine pregnancy test will be 
performed in wome n of childbearing potential.

Name of Active Ingredient: 2% miconazole  
Key Inclusion Criteria:  
Male or non-pregnant, non-lactating females with a clinical diagnosis of uncomplicated 
otomycosis of the external ear only, with an intact tympanic membrane, who are in general 
good health as determined by medical examination and medical history, and who are free of clinically significant disease, including diabetes mellitus, that is not well -controlled or that could 
interfere with the study, will be included in the study.  
Key Exclusion Criteria:  
Subjects with any other dermatoses or conditions of the ear  that may interfere with the 
evaluation of otomycosis, including concomitant otic infections (including bacterial infection) that require antimicrobial treatment, disease that has spread beyond the external ear(s), or pre-existing skin atrophy of the affected ear(s); tympanostomy tube or perforated tympanic 
membrane in the ear(s) that will be treated with study drug; history of prior surgery directly 
affecting and compromising the external auditory canal and/or  tympanic membrane of the 
ear(s) that will be treated with study drug, except for prior tympanostomy tube(s)  that have 
already been removed and completely healed; use of any topical medicated treatments for otomycosis within 14 days of study entry; use of any systemic antifungal therapy within 28 
days of study entry, warfarin within 28 days of study entry, immunosuppressive or immune-
stimulating drugs within 28 days of study entry, or systemic steroids within 3 months of study 
entry; fever of ≥100°F at study entry; recurrent otomycosis that has been unr esponsive to 
previous antifungal treatment; known hypersensitivity to any of the components in the test formulation; and participation in another investigative trial within 28 days of study entry will be 
excluded from the study.  
Test Product, Dose, and Mode of Administration:  
Miconazole oil (7-day and 14-day treatment durations)  
Active ingredient: 2% miconazole  
Other ingredients: refined peanut oil, mineral oil, oleth-2, and isopropyl myristate 
Mode of administration: subjects will be seated and then instructed to tilt their heads so that 
the affected ear is facing up. The subject or caregiver will then gently pull the ear lobe 
backward and upward and apply 5 drops of miconazole oil into the ear. The subject will be instructed to keep the head tilted with  the ear facing up for approximately 1 minute to allow the 
miconazole oil to penetrate lower into the ear canal. If both ears are being treated, the process 
will then be repeated for the other ear after a 5 -minute wait.  
Reference Product, Dose, and Mode of Administration:  
Vehicle (14- day treatment duration)  
Active ingredient: none (vehicle group)  
Other ingredients: refined peanut oil, mineral oil, oleth-2, and isopropyl myristate 
Mode of administration: same as described for the test product.  
Statistical Analyses:  
The primary and secondary endpoints will be based on the investigator reporting of signs and 
symptoms. Other efficacy endpoints will be based on the subject reporting of the symptom of 
pruritus.  
Descriptive statistics will be presented for the signs and symptoms of otomycosis for the study 
ear at each evaluation and will include the number and percentage of subjects in each 
category. Subject assessments for the study ear for pruritus will also be summarized. No

imputation will be made for missin g data.  
The primary efficacy endpoint will be the percentage of subjects at the Test of Cure Visit with 
“therapeutic cure,” defined as a negative mycological culture plus “clinical cure.” Clinical cure is 
defined as the absence of all otomycosis signs and symptoms according to the scales for each 
individual sign or symptom and with absence defined as a score of 0 on each of the scales for pruritus, debris, fungal elements, and pain.  
Other efficacy endpoints will include: 
• Percentage of subjects with clinical  cure at the Test of Cure Visit  
• Percentage of subjects with a negative fungal culture at the Test of Cure Visit  
• Percentage of subjects with a negative fungal culture at the Test of Cure visit as well as 
individual sign or symptom score of 0 or 1 on each of the scales for pruritus and debris and 
a score of 0 on each of the scales for fungal elements and pain. 
• Percentage of subjects with individual signs or symptoms with a score of 0 or 1 on each of the scales for pruritus and debris and a score of 0 on each of the scales for fungal elements 
and pain.  
• Subject global assessments at Baseline and Test of Cure as well as categorical shifts in the subject global assessment scale scores from the Screening/Baseline to the Test of Cure 
Visit 
• If feasible, analyses may also be conducted by fungal organism isolated at 
Screening/Baseline.  
The primary population for all efficacy analyses will be the modified intent-to-treat (MITT) 
population, defined as all subjects who were randomized, dispensed study drug, and with a 
clinical diagnosis of otomycosis confirmed by a positive fungal culture.  
In cases of bilateral otomycosis, the ear with the worse infection at Screening/Baseline, as 
assessed by the investigator by taking into account both clinical signs and symptoms and 
fungal culture results, will be used as the study ear for efficacy analyses. If both ears are determined by the investigator to have the same degree of infection at Screening/Baseline, the left ear will be used as the study ear for the purposes of efficacy anal yses.  
The primary population for all safety analyses will be the safety population, defined as all 
randomized subjects who received at least one dose of study drug and had at least one post-
Baseline safety assessment.  
All AEs occurring during the study will be recorded and classified using terminology from the 
Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). All reported treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), defined as any AE with an onset on or after the date of first study 
drug application, will be summarized by treatment group. Summaries will provide the number of subjects reporting TEAEs, system organ class, preferred term, severity, and relationship to study drug. When summarizing TEAEs by severity or relationship to study drug, each subject will be counted only once within a system organ class or a preferred term using the event with the greatest severity or causality, respectively, within each category. All reported SAEs will be 
summarized by the number of subjects reporting the event, system organ class, preferred 
term, severity, and relationship to study drug. 
All efficacy and safety analyses and comparisons between groups will be descriptive in nature, 
with no formal hypothesis testing performed.

Sample Size:  
The sample size for this stu dy is not based on statistical considerations and is instead intended 
to be a reasonable number of subjects upon which to gather preliminary information on the 
efficacy and safety of miconazole oil when administered via the otic route to subjects with 
otom ycosis.  
Interim Treatment Allocation Assessment(s) : 
A subject’s MITT status (specifically positive fungal culture at baseline) is determined only 
following randomization, which may result in imbalance between treatment groups. Therefore, 
at least one assessment during the conduct of the study is planned to ensure that there is  a 
sufficient number of subjects within each group for the primary analysis. Once at least 10 MITT 
subjects have been enrolled in the 7-Day active group, the number s of MITT subjects in the 
14-Day active group and the 14-Day vehicle group will be determined by an unblinded 
statistician; no persons involved in the day to day conduct of the study will be unblinded. Randomization allocation for future subjects may be adj usted if deemed necessary to achieve 
minimum number of subjects  within each arm.

1.1 Brief Background Information 
Miconazole is an imidazole antifungal agent that has been available by prescription and over the 
counter (OTC) , in different formulations, for many years. It is commonly used for different types 
of fungal skin infections, such as Candida, ringworm, jock itch, athlete’s foot, nail fungus, vaginal yeast infections, and oropharyngeal candidiasis. Formulations containing up to 4% miconazole nitrate have been app roved for OTC use as topical antifungal agents in cream, 
ointment, powder, or gel dosage forms. The 2% formulation is commonly used for dermatophytic infections. 
While antifungal agents including miconazole are used in practice for the treatment of fungal 
otitis externa (also called otomycosis), there are currently no treatments approved by the United States (US) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for this indication in humans. Miconazole is 
currently FDA -approved as a component of two veterinary combinatio n products (Surolan and 
Easotic ) administered otically to dogs  for the treatment of canine otitis externa caused by 
susceptible strains of yeast and bacteria. Each veterinary product contains miconazole in combination with an antibacterial agent and a corticosteroid. The concentration of miconazole present in Surolan (23 mg/mL miconazole nitrate) is similar to the 2% concentration of miconazole planned for use in humans in this study. The concentration of miconazole present in Easotic is 15.1 mg/mL miconazo le nitrate, which equates to approximately 1.5% miconazole. 
While the causative organism of canine otitis externa, Malassezia pachydermatis , is not typically 
associated with human otomycosis in the US, it is expected that human otomycosis, which is most co mmonly associated with organisms from the Candida and Aspergillus  genera, would 
respond to concentrations of miconazole similar to those used in dogs. 
The mechanisms of action of miconazole when used topically for the treatment of fungal 
infections involve  its actions against the fungal organisms, rather than their human host. 
Miconazole targets the cytochrome P450-dependent enzyme 14- α-sterol demethylase, an enzyme 
that is also involved in mammalian cholesterol synthesis, resulting in inhibition of ergoste rol 
biosynthesis in the cell membrane. Because ergosterol is an important component of the cell membrane, inhibition of its synthesis inhibits fungal cell growth [Vandenbosch 2012]. In addition to its activity toward the enzyme 14- α-sterol demethylase, miconazole also leads to 
increased reactive oxygen species in  fungal organisms, which appears to result in fungicidal 
activity [Vandenbosch 2010; Musaji 2010]. 
The mechanisms of action of miconazole against fungi in general appear to be applicable to 
fungi as sociated with otomycosis, in that miconazole has been demonstrated to have activity 
against some clinical isolates of fungi associated with human otomycosis in the US in vitro  
[Bassiouny 1986; Stern  1988]. Clinical studies of 2% miconazole conducted outsid e of the 
United States also suggest the efficacy of miconazole in the treatment of human otomycosis [Kiakojuri 2007; Vennewald 2010; Navaneethan 2015].  
The purpose of this study  is to gather preliminary data on the efficacy and safety of 2% 
miconazole oil after topical otic administration  in subjects with otomycosis. A 14-day regimen of

                                                                                                                   17 April 2019 / Version 6 
Page 14 of 64 twice -daily administration of 2% miconazole oil will be descriptively compared with the same 
treatment regimen using the product vehicle. Furthermore, the 14-day regimen of 2% miconazole 
oil will be compared with a 7-day regimen, to gather preliminary dose- ranging data regarding the 
duration of treatment. The 2% concentration of miconazole is selected  for this study due to the 
results of an internal study conducted by the sponsor in vitro  demonstrating greater zones of 
inhibition against Candida and Aspergillus  using the 2% concentration compared with the 1% 
concentration. Furthermore, the 2% miconazole concentration is commonly used for dermatophyte infections, and topical application is expected to be ≥1000- fold the minimum 
inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of the Candida  and Aspergillus  organisms most commonly 
associated with human otomycosis in the US. 
1.2 Compliance with Good Clinical Practice 
The investigator and all study staff will conduct the study in compliance with this protocol and 
FDA regulations, all applicable federal, state, and local laws, rules and regulations relating to the conduct of a clinical study, the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki, and the  current 
International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines.  
1.3 Justification of the Study , Risks, Dose, and Inclusion of Subjects with 
Peanut Allergy  
1.3.1 Study and Risks  
Miconazole has been approved by the US FDA since 1974 and achieved OTC status for some 
indications when FDA issued a final monograph for miconazole on September 23, 1993. Miconazole is FDA -approved as a prescription for other indications. Approved routes of 
administration in humans have included systemic (int ravenous) routes, as well as a variety of 
topical routes (dermatologic, intravaginal, and buccal).  
Miconazole has not been FDA -approved for otic administration for any indication in humans, but 
clinical stud ies in other countries  of otically -administered miconazole have been conducted and 
support the efficacy of miconazole in the treatment of otomycosis [ Kiakojuri 2007 ; Vennewald 
2010; Navaneethan 2015]. I n vitro  evidence exists of the susceptibility of clinical isolates from 
patients with otomycosis to miconazole, including one study of isolates from patients with otomycosis in the US [Bassiouny 1986; Stern 1988]. These results, along with the potential complications of untreated otomycosis, suggest a potential benefit to patients to study miconazole administered otically for the treatment of otomycosis.  
The safety of miconazole as a topical dermal application is supported by its OTC approval for dermal conditions. Side effects o f topical application  to the skin may include blistering, burning, 
redness, skin rash, or other sign of skin irritation [Pub Med Health 2015]. Side effects mentioned 
in the Monistat 1 consumer information leaflet include burning, itching, irritation, swelling, hives, skin rash, abdominal pain, and abdominal cramping. Other possib le local effects of 
miconazole which may provide benefit in otomycosis may include anti- inflammatory activity at 
the skin, and possible restoration of skin barrier function in some circumstances of skin injury [Xhauflaire -Uhoda 2006; Liebel 2006].

 17 April 2019 / Version 6 
Page 15 of 64 Evidence supporting the safety of miconazole administered b y the otic route comes largely f r om 
nonclinica l studies. The possibility exists that micona zole could access the middle ear through 
the tympanic membrane, then diffuse through the round window membrane of the middle e ar to 
reach and  damage the cochlea. M iconazole appeared to b e non -ototoxic when ins ti lled a t a 2% 
concentration directly into the round window niche of guinea pigs three 
times over the course of 
a week [Tom 2000]. M iconazole oil, instilled at 1% and 2% concentrations to guinea pigs twice 
daily over a period of 14 days in a nonclinical study conducted by the sponsor, also generally 
failed to demonstrate ototoxicity, alt hough minor hair cell los s was observed in 1 animal in each 
of the 1% and 2% miconazole groups. B ilateral h earing loss , as assessed by  incre ases i n audi t ory 
brainstem r esponses, w as observed in al l animals in t he miconazole vehicle group  as well as in 
eac
h of the 1% and 2% miconazole groups, but not in the saline control group. T hese results 
suggest that the hearing loss was due to the miconazole oil vehicle, rather t han t he miconazole 
itself. Because this hearing  loss w as ge nerally no t assoc iated with ha ir cel l los s, it is believed t hat 
this he
aring  loss was caused by instillation  of a rel atively la rge volume of  produc t in  a small 
animal (resulti ng in physical blockage of conduction), rather than actual damage to t he ear 
caused by  miconazole or  the miconazole vehicle. R efer to the  Investigator’s B rochure  (IB) for 
miconazole oil [Investigator’s B rochure f or miconazole oil 2016] for more i nformation on the 
14-day study of miconazole oil in guinea pigs. 
The bilateral hearing loss observed in guinea pigs after a 14- day treatment with miconazole oil 
and its vehicle is not expected to occur in humans at the doses and volumes of study drug 
planned for clinical use. The miconazole oil vehicle is almost identical to that of another product 
manufactured by the sponsor and approved for topical otic administration (DermOtic™, containing 0.01% fluocinolone acetonide and used for the treatment of chronic eczematous external otitis). No subjects randomized to the DermOtic group of the clinical studies reported hearing loss , and no post-marketing reports of hearing loss have been received since DermOtic ’s 
approval in 2005. 
The non-ototoxicity of the active ingredient, miconazole, is also supported in another species of 
animal by FDA approval of miconazole in  two combination products (Surolan, which contains 
approximately 2% miconazole, and Easotic, which contains approximately 1.5% miconazole) administered by the otic route for the treatment of canine otitis externa caused by susceptible strains of yeast and bacteria.  In the studies of Surolan in which hearing loss was assessed, 
hearing loss  was only reported in 3 of 161 dogs (1.9%) and with apparent reversibility in the 2 
dogs for which follow-up information was available and normal hearing was demonstrated at a later date.  
Systemic effects of miconazole are generally not expected after topical otic administration. Systemic absorption of miconazole and distribution to locations other than the skin have been demonstrated to be low after topical dermal administration, as has been reported for other miconazole-containing products such as the Vusion™ topical ointment used for the treatment of diaper dermatitis complicated by candidiasis in children. Thus, although some potential systemic effects of miconazole have been reported and the liver has been identified in prior FDA miconazole product approvals to be the main toxicological target of systemic miconazole; these 
effects are generally not expected after topical otic administration  of the doses planned for this 
study.

                                                                                                                   17 April 2019 / Version 6 
Page 16 of 64 1.3.2 Dose  
The 2% dose was selected for this study based on its widespread use in clinical practice in a 
variety of antifungal products already approved by FDA, and the larger zones of inhibition of 2% compared with 1% miconazole when incubated with two organisms commonly associated with otomycosis ( Candida albicans  and Aspergillus niger ) in a sponsor-conducted study in vitro . The 
use of 5 drops of product ( at ~30 mg per drop) is based on the estimated volume of the human 
external ear canal, and the amount believed to be needed to fully coat the canal. The 5 drops planned for this study is the same as that used for DermOtic in the treatment of chronic eczemat ous external otitis. It is noted that the dose regimen for Floxin™ otic solution (0.3% 
ofloxacin), an FDA-approved product for the treatment of bacterial otitis externa, is 10 drops in adults and children >13 years. Floxin is aqueous and may not adhere as well to the ear canal  as 
the oil- based miconazole oil. The twice- daily dosing was selected based on evidence that 
miconazole may not maintain bioactivity in the stratum corneum for a full 24 hours [Pershing 1994]. 
1.3.3 Inclusion of Subjects with Peanut Allergy 
Miconazole oil  contains refined peanut oil. Inclusion in this study of subjec ts with peanut allergy 
is justified by studies and publications documenting safe use of the refined peanut oil, as well as 
products containing the refined peanut oil (such as Derm Otic, which is the same product as the 
Derma -Smoothe/FS for  which two safety studies were performed in subjects with known 
hypersensitivity to peanuts) [Yunginger 2001; Paller 2003]. Reports also exist of subjects with known peanut allergy who have continued to safely use products such as Derma- Smoothe/FS 
even after an anaphylactic reaction to peanuts [Paller 2003]. The refined peanut oil used in the Derma -Smoothe/FS, DermOtic, and miconazole oil products has been treated to remove the 
peanut proteins which are generally responsible for allergic reactions to peanuts. Thus, the inclusion of subjects with peanut allergy in this study is not expected to pose an excessive risk to these subjects.  
2 OBJECTIVES AND RATIO NALE  
The objectives of the study are to:  
• Obtain  preliminary evidence of the efficacy and safety of miconazole oil compared with 
vehicle over a 14-day treatment duration. 
• Descriptively compare the efficacy and safety of miconazole oil over treatment durations of 7  
versus 14 days.

Page 17 of 64 3 STUDY DESIGN 
This study is a randomized, partially masked, multiple- dose, parallel -group design study 
conducted at up to 10 study centers in the US. Approximately 75 male or female subjects with 
otomycosis will receive study drug. Subjects will be randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive 
miconazole oil [administered as 5 drops per ear at ~ 30 mg per drop instilled into the external ear 
canal of the ear(s) affected by otomycosis] for 7  or 14 days, or vehicle for 14 days. I nterim 
assessment s are planned to ensure that there is a sufficient number of subjects within each group 
for the primary analysis. If deemed necessary the randomization ratio may be adjusted following 
the interim assessment s; see Section 10.5.5 for details . For subjects assigned to the 14 -day 
treatment duration with either miconazole oil or vehicle, the contents of the study drug will be masked to both the subject and the investigator and study staff (i.e., double-blind), but the treatment durat ion assigned to each subject (7 or 14 days) will be unmasked to both the subject 
and the investigator and study staff.  
At Screening/Baseline (Day 1), potentially eligible subjects will provide informed consent, and 
subjects will undergo screening evaluations to include a physical examination, an assessment of the signs and symptoms of otomycosis (pruritus, debris, visual examination for presence of fungal elements, and pain), and an evaluation of medical history . Urine will be obtaine d for 
pregnancy screening in female subjects of childbearing potential. Prior and concomitant medications will be reported. Subjects with positive signs and symptoms of otomycosis and who 
meet all other eligibility criteria will be entered into the study, and a subject global assessment of disease will be performed. Fungal and bacterial cultures of the affected ear(s) will be taken, then debris will be cleaned from the affected ear(s) following the site’s normal procedures. The subject will then begin treatment with study drug. The subject or caregiver will instill the first dose of study drug at the site, under the supervision of the investigator or site personnel. Adverse events ( AEs) will then be assessed. The subject will then leave the clinic and contin ue to 
administer the study drug twice per day as instructed. While in the study, s ubjects will be 
instructed to avoid getting water in the ear, to consider drying excessive water in the ear by using a blow dryer, and to place a Vaseline-impregnated cotton ball over the affected ear(s) to help keep water out of the ear while bathing or showering. 
All subjects will return to the clinic on Day 8. For subjects randomized to the 7- day treatment 
duration, this visit will constitute the End of Treatment Visit, with procedures performed as 
described for that visit below. Subjects randomized to the 7- day treatment duration will not 
administer study drug on the day of this visit. For all other subjects, for whom this visit will constitute an On Treatment Visit, a clin ical evaluation of the signs and symptoms of otomycosis, 
a subject global assessment, a cleaning of the affected ear(s) (following the site’s normal procedures), and an assessment of AEs and concomitant medications will be performed, and these subjects wil l continue to administer the study drug twice per day, up through Day 14, 
following the same instructions as provided at the Screening/Baseline Visit on Day 1. 
All subjects will return to the clinic on Day 15. For subjects randomized to the 7- day treatment  
duration, this visit will constitute the Test of Cure Visit, with procedures performed as described 
for the Test of Cure Visit below. For subjects randomized to the 14-day treatment duration, this visit will constitute the End of Treatment Visit, with pro cedures performed as described for th e

Page 18 of 64 End of Treatment Visit below.  Subjects randomized to the 14- day treatment duration will not 
administer study drug on the day of this visit. 
Subjects randomized to the 14-day durations will return to the clinic on Day 22 for the Test of 
Cure Visit, with procedures performed as described for the Test of Cure Visit below.  
Procedures performed at the End of Treatment Visit will include an assessment for clinical signs 
and symptoms of otomycosis, a subject global assessmen t, and a fungal culture of the affected 
ear(s). For subjects randomized to the 7 -day treatment duration, subjects will have the affected 
ear(s) cleaned according to the site’s normal procedures at this visit, after the efficacy procedures have been completed. AEs and concomitant medications will also be assessed, and the subject will return all study drug.   
Procedures performed at the Test of Cure Visit will include an assessment of clinical signs and symptoms of otomycosis, a subject global assessment, and  a fungal culture of the affected ear(s). 
AEs and concomitant medications will also be assessed. A urine pregnancy test will be performed in women of childbearing potential. 
Efficacy assessments will include fungal culture of the affected ear(s), assessmen ts of clinical 
signs and symptoms of otomycosis, and a subject global assessment. In cases of bilateral 
otomycosis, both ears will be treated and evaluated by the investigator, but the ear with the worse infection at Screening/Baseline, as assessed by the investigator by taking into account both clinical signs and symptoms and fungal culture results, will be used as the study ear for efficacy analyses. If both ears are determined by the investigator to have the same degree of infection at Screening/Baseline, the left ear will be used as the study ear for the purposes of efficacy analyses. 
Safety assessments will include AEs.  
3.1 Number of Subjects 
Approximately 75 eligible subjects are planned to be enrolled in order to achieve approximately 
10 subjects per group (randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to the 7-day active, 14-day active, and 14-day 
vehicle treatment groups) with a positive fungal culture at baseline and who have completed the 
Test of Cure Visit . 
3.2 Investigators 
The study will be conducted a t up to 10 investigative site s located in the US.  
The study will be conducted by investigators who are determined by the sponsor to be suitably qualified by training and experience to conduct this study in compliance with all applicable GCP and FDA federal regulations or local regulations. Sub-investigators will be identified on the Form FDA 1572.

to: 
•A serious adverse event (SAE) occurring during the course of the study which precludes
continued follow-up
•Intercurrent illness which may, in the investigator’s opinion, significantly affect study
assessments
•Failure to follow required study procedures
A subject MUST be discontinued prior to the final study visit for any of the following reasons: 
•Whenever the subject decides it is in his/her best interest to withdraw
•Whene ver the investigator decides it is in the subject’s best interest to be withdrawn

 17 April 2019 / Version 6 
Page 22 of 64 Prior to discontinuing a subject, every effort should be made to contact the subject, schedule a 
final study visit, and obtain as much follow-up data as possible. If possible , the assessment 
schedule for the Test of Cure V isit should be performed, and an effort should be made to collect 
all study drug. 
Due to the time required to obtain fungal culture results from Screening/Baseline, subjects will 
be enrolled into the study based on a clinical diagnosis of otomycosis (including the visible 
presence of fungal elements at  Screening/Base line), without a requirement for a positive fungal 
culture. Subjects who end up with a negative Screening/B aseline  fungal culture will not be 
discontinued from the study, but these subjects will not be included in the primary efficacy analysis. Because the sponsor’s goal is to obtain approximately 10 subjects per group who meet both criteria of having a positive fungal culture at Screening/Baseline and completing the Test of Cure Visit, the number of subjects enrolled into the study may be adjusted depending on the rates of negative fungal culture at Screening/Baseline and of discontinuation or loss to follow-up. 
Subject discontinuations will be documented clearly on the applicable electronic case report form 
(eCRF ). Subjects who discontinue from the study will not be replaced, but additional subjects 
may be enrolled and randomized if it appears that approximately 75 subjects is insufficient to meet the sponsor’s goal of approximately 10 subjects per group who meet both criteria of having a positive fungal culture at Screening/Baseline and completing the Test of Cure Visit.  
4.5 Subjects Lost to Follow-up 
An effort must be made to contact subjects who do not return for scheduled visits, to schedule the visit and/or obtain as much follow- up data as possible. At least three telephone calls must be 
placed to the subject at the first missed visit, to attempt to get the subject t o complete the visit  
and to gather as much follow-up data as possible . At least three telephone calls must also be 
placed to the subject for any subsequent missed visits after an attended visit , to attempt to get the 
subject to complete the visit and to ga ther as much follow-up data as possible. Subjects who miss 
a visit may still be scheduled for a subsequent visit . Subjects who cannot be contacted via t hree 
telephone calls to schedule a missed  visit may be considered lost to follow-up and discontinued 
from the study. 
All follow -up attempts will be documented and kept with the subject’s source documentation, 
and the applicable e CRFs will be completed. The date a subject will be considered lost to follow -
up will be the date of the last non- missing visit.

Page 23 of 64 5 CONCOMITANT THERAPIES  
All concomitant therapies must be recorded on the e CRF. All therapies within 28 days prior to 
Day 1 must  also be recorded on the e CRF.  
Every effort should be made to keep concomitant therapy and dosing constant during the study. 
Any changes in concomitant therapies during the study must be recorded on the e CRF  at each 
visit. The reason for any change in concomitant therapies should be reported as, or in 
conjunction with, an AE except as noted below:  
• Prophylactic therapies, such as va ccines, must be recorded on the e CRF  but should not be 
reported as AEs.  
• Changes in therapy for pre-existing conditions that are not related to a worsening of the condition must be reported on the e CRF  but should not be reported as AEs . The condition 
must be reported on the e CRF as part of the subject’s medical history.   
5.1 Permitted Medications 
Therapies (medication and non-medication therapies) not restricted by the protocol may be used during the study for the treatment or prevention of disease or to maintain good health. Vitamins and mineral supplements are permitted at dosages considered by the investigator as reasonable for maintaining good health. Non-prohibited chronic therapies being used at  Screening/Baseline 
may be continued. 
5.2 Prohibited Medications 
Other than the study drug , no other topical medications are allowed to be used in the ears. Other 
prohibited treatments include systemic antifungal therapy, warfarin, immunosuppressive or 
immune -stimulating drugs, and systemic steroids.

Page 28 of 64 6.5 Unscheduled Study Visits 
Additional visits may be scheduled, as necessary, to ensure the safety and well -being of subjects. 
All additional examinations should be fully documented in the source files and e CRFs, as 
appropriate. Visits that fa ll outside the designated scheduled visit window but that are intended 
to fulfill scheduled visit requirements will be collected and transcribed to the appropriate 
scheduled visit e CRF.  
If a subject is seen for multiple visits during a given visit time fra me, the data from the visit (s) 
that are intended to meet the protocol requirements for the scheduled visit should be captured on the visit e CRF. Any other data from any additional visits within a scheduled visit interval will be 
captured elsewhere on the e CRF.  
6.6 Post-study Follow-up 
If a subject requires further follow -up of AEs upon discontinuation or completion of the study, 
the investigator should schedule post-study follow- up visits, as necessary.  
6.7 Missed Visits 
If a subject misses any scheduled follow-up visit and cannot be seen prior to the start of the visit range for the next scheduled fo llow-up visit, the visit is considered missed.  
6.8 Subject Completion  
The subject has completed the study when the Test of Cure Visit is completed. Subjects who require further follow -up for an AE will be followed according to Section 6.6. 
6.9 Early Study Termination 
The sponsor rese rves the right to terminate this study prematurely. If during the study it becomes 
evident to the sponsor that the study should be stopped prematurely, the study will be terminated and appropriate notification will be given to the investigator, IRB, and FDA, as applicable. The sponsor or designee will instruct the investigator to stop randomizing subjects and to arrange for study closeout at the site.

Page 29 of 64 7 STUDY PROCEDURES 
The required study procedures are detailed in this section. The timeline for these procedures is 
presented in Section 6. 
7.1 Medical/Medication History  
At Screening/Baseline, the investigator or designee will interview each subject and obtain a 
complete medical  and medication history, including a history of all surgeries and past medical 
procedures. The subject must not require any treatment or medication for concurrent illnesses as specified by the inclusion and exclusion criteria or anticipate the need for any excluded concomitant medications. 
7.2 Physical Examination 
At Screening/Baseline, the investigator or designee will perform a complete physical 
examination to include the following: general appearance; head, eyes, ears, nose, throat; neck; 
cardiovascular; lungs; abdomen; lymph nodes; extremities; neurological; skin; and musculoskeletal . 
7.3 Urine Pregnancy Test  
The urine pregnancy test (performed in females of childbearing potential only) must have a minimum sensitivity of 25  mIU of β -hCG/mL of urine. 
7.4 Otomycosis Signs and Symptoms 
The signs and symptoms of otomycosis will be assessed according to the scales for pruritus (see Section 7.4.1), debris (see Section 7.4.2), presence of fungal elements (see Section 7.4.3), and pain (see Section 7.4.4). The same evaluator should assess each subject for signs and symptoms 
of otomycosis at each visit throughout the subject’s participation in the study, if possible. 
7.4.1 Pruritus 
7.4.1.1 Subject Assessment 
Subjects or their caregivers (as appropriate, based on the age of the subject) will be handed a 
questionnaire for each ear being treated with study drug and asked to indicate the choice that 
most closely reflects the severity of itching  in the ear  over t he last 24 hours. Choices and scores 
will be according to the following scale:  
Score  Category  Description  
0 None No itching 
1 Mild  Occasional itch, not interfering with daily activities  
2 Moderate  Fairly persistent itch, partially tolerated; sleep is not interrupted 
3 Severe  Intolerable, constant itch; sleep is interrupted  
Hill Dermaceuticals, Inc.   Protocol HD- MCZ -PHII- DRF062016 
                                                                                                                   17 April 2019 / Version 6 
Page 30 of 64 7.4.1.2 Investigator Assessment  
After subjects have completed the questionnaire described in Section 7.4.1.1, subjects or their 
caregivers (as appropriate, based on the age of the subject) will be asked by the investigator (or designee) about the severity of itching present in each ear being treated  with study drug. 
Questions such as the following will be used in order to gather information for this assessment: 
“Have you had itching in your ear over the last day or so?” 
“Over the last 24 hours, has your itching interfered with your daily activities?”  
“Over the last 24 hours, has your itching been bad enough to keep you awake?” “Over the last 24 hours, would you describe your itching as intolerable or constant?” 
The investigator will then score the symptom of pruritus for each ear being treated with study 
drug, taking into consideration the subject’s and/or caregiver’s answers and the investigator’s observations of the subject. Scores will be according to the same scale as described in Section 7.4.1.1. 
7.4.2 Debris 
Upon otoscopic examination, the investigator will score the amount of debris present in each ear 
being treated with study drug. Scores will be  according to the following scale: 
Score  Category  Description  
0 None No debris present 
1 Scant  Debris minimally present, but with no notable occlusion of external ear 
canal  
2 Moderate  Debris present with partial occlusion of external ear canal; tympanic 
membrane can be visualized  
3 Heavy  Complete occlusion of ear canal; tympanic membrane cannot be visualized

                                                                                                                   17 April 2019 / Version 6 
Page 31 of 64 7.4.3 Presence of Fungal Elements 
Upon otoscopic examination, the investigator will assess the presence of fungal elements in each 
ear being treated with study drug. Scores will be according to the following scale: 
Score  Category  Description  
0 Absent No fungal elements present on visual inspection with otoscope 
1 Present  Fungal elements present on visual inspection with otoscope, such as 
visualization of white filaments in debris; black, gray, bluish, yellow, 
or white discharge; white debris with hyphae; or moist white plugs with black debris; or other observations that in the investigator’s judgment are indicative of the presence of fungus 
7.4.4 Pain  
Subjects or their caregivers (as appropriate, based on the age of the subject) will be asked by the 
investigator (or designee) whether pain is present in each ear being treated with study drug. Questions such as the following will be used in order to gather information for this assessment: 
“Over the last 24 hours, has your ear hurt?” 
“Over the last 24 hours, has your pain been constant?” “Over the last 24 hours, would you characterize your pain as more dull or sharp ?” 
“Over the last 24 hours, have you had pain when your earlobe or the front part of your ear is 
touched?” 
“Over the last 24 hours, have you felt pain inside your ear?” “Over the last 24 hours, have you felt pain on the outside of your ear?” 
The investigator will then score the symptom of pain for each ear being treated with study drug, 
taking into consideration the subject’s and/or caregiver’s answers and the investigator’s observations of the subject. Scores will be according to the following scale: 
Score  Category  Description  
0 Absent No pain 
1 Present  Pain present, easily tolerated to intolerable  
Hill Dermaceuticals, Inc.   Protocol HD- MCZ -PHII- DRF062016

Page 32 of 64 7.5 Subject Global Assessment  
Subjects or their caregivers (as appropriate, based on the age of the subject) will be asked to 
choose among the following three options to assess the overall level of discomfort in each ear being treated with study drug. Subjects or their caregivers will be handed a questionnaire for 
each ear being treated with study drug and asked to indicate the choice that most closely reflects 
the subject's situation  with the ear. Choices and scores will be according to the following scale: 
Score  Category  Description  
0 None My ear is not causing me any discomfort and is not stopping me from 
my normal activities  
1 Minor My ear is slightly uncomfortable, but it is not for the most part 
stopping me from my normal activities 
2 Moderate  My ear is uncomfortable, and it is stopping me from at least some of my normal activities  
7.6 Microbial Culture 
At designated visits, the investigator or designee will obtain a sample from the external ear to be sent to a laboratory for microbial culture  (for both fungi and bacteria at the Screening/Baseline 
visit and for fungi only at the End of Treatment and Test of Cure visits). Techniques for obtaining and handling the sample and sending it to the laboratory will be described in a separate laboratory manual. If both ears will be treated with study drug, both ears will be cultured. 
7.7 Ear Cleaning 
At designated visit s, the investigator or designee will clean the ear(s) that are being/have been 
treated with study drug, according to the site’s normal procedures. Ear(s) being treated will be 
cleaned  at the designated visits even if they appear clear of debris . In cases i n which the 
investigator would normally not clean the ear because it appears to be clear, this cleaning may  be 
minimal . All ear cleaning will be documented in the e CRF.

Page 33 of 64 7.11 Treatment Compliance 
Subjects or their caregivers  (as appropriate) will complete a diary documenting each study drug 
administration. Additionally, each bottle of study drug will be weighed by the investigator or 
designee before dispensation  to the subject and at each visit in which the us ed bottle is brought to 
the site. 
7.12 Protocol Deviations 
The IRB-approved protocol must be followed except in the case of a change that is intended to 
eliminate an immediate risk to subjects.  
The date of, nature of, and reason for deviations will be documented and explained by the investigator in all cases. Significant or major protocol deviations impacting the safety of the subject or the integrity of the study must be reported by the investigator to  the sponsor and/or its 
designee and to  the IRB immediately.  Reporting of all other protocol deviations must adhere to 
the requirements of the governing IRB. 
All changes to the protocol will be made by the sponsor or designee as an approved amendment 
to the protocol, submitted to the FDA, and approved by the IRB pr ior to implementation. New or 
altered consent forms required by the IRB due to a protocol revision must be signed by all subjects currently enrolled in the study and must be used for any subsequent subject enrollment.

Page 34 of 64 8 ADVERSE EVENT S 
8.1 Definition of an Adverse Event  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject or clinical investigation subject 
administered a study drug and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the study drug. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including a clinically significant abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of an investigational or marketed study drug, whether or not considered re lated to the 
investigational or marketed study drug . AEs include any illness, sign, or symptom that has 
appeared or worsened during the course of the clinical trial, regardless of causal relationship to the study drug . Study drug includes the investigational drug under evaluation and the comparator 
product. 
Medical conditions/diseases present before signing the informed consent form are only 
considered AEs if they worsen after the informed consent form is signed.  
AEs may be either spontaneously reported or elicited during questioning and examination of a 
subject. At each examination or visit, study personnel will ask each subject the following question, “Have you had any problems since we last spoke?” If known, the investigator should report the diagnosis of the underlying illness or disorder, rather than its individual symptoms.  
8.1.1 Definition of a Serious Adverse Event  
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence occurring at any dose that results in any of the following outcomes: 
• Results in death  
• Is life -threate ning (defined as an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the 
time of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe)  
• Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• Is an important medical event (defined as a medical event(s) that may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization but, based upon appropriate medical 
and scientific judgment may jeopardize the patient/subject or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other serious outcomes listed in the definition above). Examples of such events include, but are not limited to : allergic bronchospasm 
requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home; blood dyscrasia or 
convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization; the development of drug 
dependency or drug abuse.

Page 35 of 64 Treatment on an outpatient emergency basis that does not result in hospital admission, or a 
hospitalization that is elective or is a preplanned treatment for a pre -existing condition that has 
not worsened since the start of the study, is not considered an SAE. 
8.2 Severity of Adverse Events  
The severity of an AE will be determined by the investigator according to the following 
definitions:  
• Mild: Awareness of event, but easily tolerated and does not disrupt usual  activity  
• Moderate:  Discomfort sufficient to cause interference with usual  activity  
• Severe:  Incapacitating, with inability to perform usual activities  
8.3 Relationship of Adverse Events to Study Drug  
The relationship of AEs to the study drug will be assessed by the investigator according to the following definitions: 
• Not suspected:  The temporal relationship of the event to the study drug makes a causal 
relationship unlikely, or, other drugs, therapeutic interventions or underlying conditions provide a sufficient explanation for the observed event. 
• Suspected:  The temporal relationship of the event to the study drug makes a causal 
relationship possible or other drugs, therapeutic interventions or underlying conditions do not provide a sufficient explanation for the observed event. 
If there is any valid reason, even if undetermined, for suspecting a possible cause -and- effect 
relationship between the study drug and the occurrence of the AE, then the AE should be 
considered “suspected.”  
If the relat ionship between the AE and the study drug is determined by the s ponsor to be 
“suspected,” the event will be considered to be related to the study drug for the purposes of expedited regulatory reporting. 
8.4 Documentation of Adverse Events 
All AEs must be compl etely recorded on the Adverse Events section of the eCRF. The collection 
of AE information should begin after the subject has signed informed consent and continue up 
through the Test of Cure Visit . Subjects experiencing AEs that cause interruption or 
disco ntinuation of study drug, or those experiencing AEs that are present at the end of their 
participation in the study or that resulted in permanent discontinuation will receive follow-up as appropriate until the AEs have either resolved or have stabilized.  
For each AE, the Investigator will evaluate and report the following: 
• Onset (date);  
• Resolution (date);  
• Severity grade (mild, moderate, severe);

Page 36 of 64 • Relationship to study drug  (not suspected, suspected); 
• Action taken (none, study drug temporarily interrupted, study drug permanently 
discontinued, concomitant medication taken, hospitalization/prolonged hospitalization, other); 
• Serious (yes/no); 
• Whether the AE occurred at the study drug application site (yes/no) ; 
• For AEs of the ear, which ear (left, right, or both) was affected . 
8.4.1 Additional Reporting Requirements for Serious Adverse Events 
All SAEs that occur from the time the subject has signed the informed consent until the Test of Cure Visit will be reported. Additionally, any SAEs “suspected” to be related to the study drug and discovered by the investigator at any time after the study should be reported. Each of these SAEs must be reported to the sponsor’s designee within 24 hours of the occurrence of the SAE, 
or within 24 hours of learning of the SAE . Information on recurrent episodes, complications, or 
progression of the initial SAE must also be reported within 24 hours of the investigator receiving the information.  
Reporting may be by telephone, confirmed facsimile transmission, or confirmed email to  the 
medical monitor.  The investigator must assess the relationship of the SAE to study drug  and 
must complete the SAE form. If only limited information is initially available, follow -up reports 
are required. Follow-up information (e.g., discharge summary) will be retained in the subject’s 
chart and a copy (with the subject’s personal information removed and with the subject identified only by subject number) will be sent by confirmed facsimile transmission  or confirmed email to 
the medical monitor . In the event of death, if an autopsy is performed, a copy of the report (with 
the subject’s personal information removed and with the subject identified only by subject number) should be sent to the medical monitor. 
As required  and after the sponsor’s review and determination of causality , the sponsor and/or 
designee will notify investigators of all AEs that are serious, unexpected, and considered by the 
investigator to have a suspected  relationship to the study drug . This notification will be in the 
form of an update to the Investigator’s Brochure (i.e., “15- day letter ”). An AE, whether serious 
or non- serious, is designated unexpected (unlabeled) if it is not reported in the clinical safety 
section of the Investigator’s Brochure or if the event is of greater frequency, specificity or severity.  
Upon receiving such notices, the investigator must review and retain the notice with the 
Investigator’s Brochure and immediately submit a copy of this information to the responsible IRB according to local regulations. The investigator and IRB will determine if the informed consent requires revision. The investigator should also comply with the IRB procedures for reporting any other safety information. Follow-up reports should be submitted when requested or when pertinent information becomes available.

Page 37 of 64 The sponsor will report all SAEs to the US FDA on the appropriate schedule depending on the 
event’s expectedness and relationship to study drug  based on the available information as 
presented in the Investigator’s Brochure.  
Any SAE occurring after the Test of Cure Visit  and which is  not considered to be of “suspected” 
relationship to study drug does not need to be reported. 
8.5 Pregnancy 
Females of childbearing potential, as defined in Section 4.1, must use an effective method of 
contraception from screening up through the Test of Cure Visit. Acceptable methods include the use of at least  one of the following: 1) IUD;  2) hormonal contraceptives (oral, injectable , 
implant, or ring) ; 3) barrier  contraceptives (condom or diaphragm) with spermicide ; or 4) 
abstinence.  
Should a pregnancy occur, it must be reported and recorded on the pregnancy form and sent by confirmed facsimile  or confirmed email to the medical monitor, as well as documented in the 
eCRF. Pregnancy in itself is not regarded as an AE unless there is a suspicion that the study drug 
product may have interfered with the effectivenes s of a contraceptive medication.  
The outcome of all pregnancies (spontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, normal birth, or congenital abnormality) must be followed up and documented even if the subject was discontinued from the study. 
8.6 Study Contacts 
Study contacts will be provided in a separate document.

Page 38 of 64 9 STUDY TREATMENTS 
9.1 Description of Study Drug 
Miconazole oil contains the active ingredient, 2% miconazole, formulated in an oil vehicle 
containing refined peanut oil, light mineral oil, oleth -2, and isopropyl myristate. For subjects 
randomized to the 14-day groups, 2% miconazole oil will be compared descriptively against the oil vehicle, which will not contain miconazole and will instead contain a greater amount of refined peanut oil and mineral oil t o account for the absence of the miconazole.  
Study drug will be supplied in bottles containing ~20 grams of product. The dispensing tip will 
deliver approximately 30 mg of product per drop. 
9.1.1 Administration 
Subjects will be seated  or lying on one side with the head positioned so the ear  being treated is 
facing up. If both ears are being treated, the ear that appears to have less severe disease will be 
treated first. The subject or caregiver will gently pull the ear lobe backward and upward and 
apply 5 drops of miconazole oil into the ear. The subject will be instructed to keep the head 
positioned with the ear facing up for approximately 1 minute to allow the miconazole oil to coat  
the ear canal . After 1 minute, t he subject can then straighten his/her head , and excess material 
dripping out of the ear can be gently patted using a clean cotton ball.  
If both ears are being treated, t he subject will then wait at least 5 minutes, then repeat this 
procedure for the second ear. 
While on study treatment, subjects will be instructed to avoid getting water in the ear, to consider drying excessive water in the ear by using a blow dryer, and to place a Vaseline-impregnated cotton ball over the affected ear(s) to help keep water out of the ear(s) while bathing or showering. Subjects will be asked  to avoid bath ing or shower for at least 30 minutes after 
applying study drug. 
9.2 Randomization 
Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to one of three  groups: 1) 7- day tre atment with 
mi
conazole oil; 2) 14-day tre atment with m icona zole oil; or 3) 14- day treatment with miconazole 
oil vehicle. I nterim assessm ents are planned t o ensure that there is a sufficient  num ber of  subjects 
within each group for the primary analysis. If deemed necessary the randomization ratio may be 
adjusted following the interim assessments; see Section 10.5.5 f or details. 
9.3 Masking/Unmasking  
The duration of treatment will not be masked. For subjects randomized to the 14- day treatment 
durations, the contents of the study drug (miconazole oil versus vehicle) will be masked. 
Randomized study drug will be packaged in identical bottles and will be labeled with a randomization number rather than the contents of the bottle.

                                                                                                                   17 April 2019 / Version 6 
Page 39 of 64 For subjects randomized to the 14- day durations, i f it becomes necessary to unmask a subject’s 
treatment assignment in case of emergency, the investigator should contact the sponsor. A person 
at the sponsor organization who is not otherwise involved with the study will maintain a randomization list that w ill enable that person to inform the investigator of the subject’s 
treatment allocation. The treatment allocation  is to be obtained only if a medical emergency 
exists and knowledge of the medication being taken will influence the medical management of the subject.  
9.4 Study Drug  Handling and Dispensing  
9.4.1 Packaging  and Labeling 
The miconazole oil and the oil vehicle will be manufactured, packaged and labeled by Hill Dermaceuticals, Inc. It will be packaged in dropper bottles, each of which will contain ~20 
grams of study drug. The dropper will  dispense approximately 30 mg per drop. 
The Study drug and Vehicle will be packaged in primary bottle and provided in identical study drug kits. Each kit will contain the investigational drug product (or placebo product) , reserve 
identical drug product (or placebo product), bag of cotton balls, and Vaseline jelly. The subject will be dispensed the kit  (minus the reserve product) at Baseline only. The dropper bottles will 
be weighed with the cap on prior to dispensing. If the s ubject loses a bottle (lost or damaged), the 
reserve bottle will be dispensed using a replacement process as defined in the randomization plan. Each drug kit dispensed will be documented on the drug accountability log. Labels on the drug kit will contain the following information:  
• Protocol Number 
• Subject Number  
• Space for entry of the subject initials  
• Space for entry of date dispensed  
• A statement reading, “For otic use only. Avoid contact with eyes and lips” 
• A statement reading, “Store at controlled room te mperature 20°C to 25°C (68°F to 77°F) 
with excursions permitted between 15°C to 30°C (59°F to 86°F)”  
• A statement indicating the sponsor, Hill Dermaceuticals  
• A statement indicating the quantity of product (20 grams ) 
• A statement reading, “Caution: New Drug - Limited by Federal Law to Investigational Use” 
• A statement reading, “Keep out of Reach of Children 
9.4.2 Storage  
The study drug is to be stored at room temperature (20°C to 25°C, or 68°F to 77°F), with excursions permitted between 15°C and 30°C (59°F and 86°F) . All investigational study drug 
must be stored in a secure facility, with access limited to the investigator and authorized staff.

Page 40 of 64 9.5 Accountability  
The investigator or designee (e.g, study coordinator or pharmacist) is responsible for ensuring 
storage as per the label on the study drug and adequate accountability of all used and unused study drug. Adequate accountability includes acknowledgment of receipt of each shipment of study drug (quantity and condit ion), records  of administration (including container number, date 
administered , subject number, and the initials of the person administering the drug), and 
documentation of quantities returned to the sponsor (or designee). 
At time points during the course of the study and/or upon completion of the study, the sponsor or designee will review and verify the investigator's accountability records.   
9.6 Return and Destruction 
At the completion of the study, following verification of the investigator’s accountability records 
by the sponsor and/or designee, all study drug must be returned to the sponsor or designee. This would include study drug returned by the subjects at the completion of the study, and reserve products that were not used.

Page 41 of 64 10 STATISTICAL CONSIDER ATIONS 
10.1 Study Endpoints 
The primary and secondary endpoints will be based on the investigator reporting of signs and 
symptoms  for the study ear. Other efficacy endpoints will be based on the subject reporting of 
the symptom of pruritus.  
Descriptive statistics will  be presented for the signs and symptoms of otomycosis for the study 
ear at each evaluation and will include the number and percentage of subjects in each category. 
Subject assessments for the study ear for pruritus will also be summarized. No imputation w ill be 
made for missing data.   
10.1.1 Primary Efficacy Endpoint  
The primary efficacy endpoint will be the percentage of subjects at the Test of Cure Visit with 
“therapeutic cure,” defined as a negative mycological culture plus “clinical cure” for the study ear.  Clinical cure is defined as the absence of all otomycosis signs and symptoms based on Investigator assessment according to the scales for each individual sign or symptom and with 
absence defined as a score of 0 on each of the scales for pruritus, debris, fungal elements, and pain). See Section 7.4 for the scales for each otomycosis sign and symptom.  
10.1.2 Secondary Efficacy Endpoints 
Secondary efficacy en dpoints will include the following: 
• Percentage of subjects with clinical cure at the Test of Cure Visit  
• Percentage of subjects with a negative fungal culture at the Test of Cure Visit  
• Percentage of subjects with a negative fungal culture at the Test of Cur e visit as well as 
individual sign or symptom score of 0 or 1 on each of the scales for pruritus and debris and a score of 0 on each of the scales for fungal elements and pain.  
• Percentage of subjects with individual signs or symptoms with a score of 0 or 1 on each 
of the scales for pruritus and debris and a score of 0 on each of the scales for fungal 
elements and pain.  
• Subject global assessments at Baseline and Test of Cure as well as categorical shifts in the subject global assessment scale scores from the Screening/Baseline to the Test of Cure Visit.  
• If feasible, analyses may also be conducted by fungal organism isolated at 
Screening/Baseline.

 17 April 2019 / Version 6 
Page 42 of 64 10.1.3 Other Efficacy Endpoint s 
Other efficacy endpoints based on subject reporting of pruritus  will include the followin g: 
•Subject therapeutic cure (defined as a negative mycological culture plus clinical cure) at
the Test of Cure visit  for the study ear based on subject assessment of pruritus. Clinical
cure is defined as the absence of all otomycosis signs and symptoms according to the
scales for each individual sign or symptom and with absence defined as a score of 0 oneach of the scales for pruritus, debris, fungal elements,  and pain.
10.1.4 Safety Endpoints 
Safety endpoints will be the percentage of subjects with treatment- emergent A Es, with 
treatment-emergent defined as occurring upon or after administration of the first dose of study drug. 
10.2 Hypotheses 
No formal hypotheses will be tested in this study. Descriptive comparisons will be made between 
the miconazole oil and the oil vehicle groups for subjects randomized to the 14-day groups. Additionally, descriptive comparisons will be made between the 7-day and  14-day groups for 
subjects randomized to the miconazole oil treatment.  
10.3 Sample Size 
The sample size for this study is not based on statistical considerations and is instead intended to be a reasonable number of subjects upon which to gather preliminary information on the efficacy and safety of miconazole oil when administered via the otic route to subjects with otomycosis.  
10.4 Study Populations 
10.4.1 Intent-t o-treat Population 
The intent- to-treat (ITT) population will be defined as all subjects who were randomized and 
dispensed study medication. 
10.4.2 Modified Intent-t o-treat Population 
The modified intent- to-treat (MITT)  population will be a subset of the ITT population. The 
MITT population will include subjects who were randomized, dispensed study drug, and with a clinical diagnosis of otomycosis confirmed by a positive fungal culture 
Hill Dermaceuticals, Inc.   Protocol HD- MCZ -PHII- DRF062016 
                                                                                                                   17 April 2019 / Version 6 
Page 43 of 64 10.4.3 Per Protocol Population 
The per protocol (PP) population will be a subset of the MITT population and will include all 
subjects who complete the Test of Cure visit without any major protocol violations. The PP 
population will include subjects in the MITT population who did not meet any of the following 
criteria:  
• Violated the inclusion/exclusion criteria  
• Used an interfering concomitant medication 
• Did not attend the Test of Cure visit 
• Did not attend the End of Treatment visit 
• Have not been compliant with the dosing regimen (i.e., subjects must have received 
80%-120% of the expected applications of study medication in the study ear during 
participation in the study) 
• Out of visit window at the Test of Cure Visit (-1/+8 days) 
Subjects who  discontinue from the study due to an adverse event related to study treatment, 
documented lack of treatment effect, or worsening of condition will be included in the PP population. Prior to breaking the blind, other additional criteria may be added to the list to 
accommodate for unforeseen events that occurred during the conduct of the trial that result in noteworthy study protocol violations. 
10.4.4 Safety Population 
The safety population will include all randomized subjects who received at least one dose of 
study drug and had at least one post-B aseline safety assessment.  
10.5 Statistical Methods 
Details of statistical analyses will be provided in a separate statistical analysis plan.  
10.5.1 Efficacy  Analys es 
The primary population for all efficacy analyses will be the MITT population (see Section 10.4) . 
Efficacy endpoints will also be summarized for the PP population and will be considered supportive. 
The sample size N, frequency, and percent of subjects who demonstrate a positive outcome for 
each efficacy endpoint will be presented for the primary efficacy parameter as well as all 
secondary efficacy parameters.  
In cases of bilateral otomycosis, the ear with the worse infection at Screening/Baseline, as assessed by the investigator by taking into account both clinical signs and symptoms and fungal culture results, will be used as the study ear for efficacy analyses. If both ears are determined by 
Hill Dermaceuticals, Inc.   Protocol HD- MCZ -PHII- DRF062016 
                                                                                                                   17 April 2019 / Version 6 
Page 44 of 64 the investigator to have the same degree of infection at Screening/Baseline, the left ear will b e 
used as the study ear for the purposes of efficacy analyses.  
10.5.2 Safety Analyses 
Safety summar ies will be conducted using the safety population (see Section 10.4.4) . All AEs 
occurring during the study will be recorded and classified using terminology from the Medical 
Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). All reported treatment- emergent adverse events 
(TEAEs), defined as any AE with an onset on  or after the date of first study drug application, 
will be summarized by treatment group . Summaries  will provide the number of subjects 
reporting TEAEs, system organ class, preferred term, severity, and relationship to study drug. 
When summarizing TEAEs by severity or relationship to study drug, each subject will be counted only once within a system organ class or a preferred term using the event with the 
greatest severity or causality, respectively, within each category. All reported SAEs will be 
summariz ed by the number of subjects reporting the event, system organ class, preferred term, 
severity, and relationship to study drug. 
All information pertaining to AEs noted during the study will be listed by treatment group and 
subject and will include a verbatim description of the event as reported by the investigator, as well as the preferred term, system organ class, start date, stop date (if stopped), seriousness, severity, action taken regarding the study drug, corrective treatment, outcome, and relationshi p to 
the study drug. In addition, a listing of subjects who prematurely discontinue from the study due to AEs will be provided as well as a listing of subjects who report an SAE. 
10.5.3 Subject Demographics and Baseline Characteristics 
Subject demographic and bas eline characteristics will be summarized descriptively for the 
MITT, PP, and Safety populations and will be supported with individual subject data listings.  
10.5.4 Missing Data 
Missing values from the Test of Cure visit from which the dichotomized Therapeutic Cur e is 
derived will be imputed using last observation carried forward (LOCF) method. 
10.5.5 Interim Treatment Allocation Assessment(s)  
A subject’s MITT status (specifically positive fungal culture at baseline) is determined only 
following randomization, which may r esult in imbalance between treatment groups. Therefore, at 
least one assessment during the conduct of the study is planned to ensure that there is a sufficient number of subjects within each group for the primary analysis. Once at least 10 MITT subjects have been enrolled in the 7-Day active group, the numbers of MITT subjects in the 14- Day 
active group and the 14-Day vehicle group will be determined by an unblinded statistician; no persons involved in the day to day conduct of the study will be unblinded. Randomization allocation for future subjects may be adjusted if deemed necessary to achieve minimum number of subjects within each arm.  
Full details will be provided in the SAP.

Test Product, Dose, and Mode of Administration:  
Miconazole oil ( 7-day and  14-day treatment duration  durations ) 
Statistical Analyses: 
The primary and secondary endpoints will be based on the investigator reporting of signs and symptoms. Other efficacy endpoints will be based on the subject reporting of the symptom of pruritus.  
Descriptive statistics will be presented for the signs and symptoms of otomycosis for the study ear 
at each evaluation and will include the number and percentage of subjects in each category. 
Subject assessments for the study ear for pruritus will also be summarized. No imputation wi ll be 
made for missing data.  
The primary efficacy endpoint will be the percentage of subjects at the Test of Cure Visit with “therapeutic cure,” defined as a negative mycological culture plus “clinical cure.” Clinical cure is 
defined as the absence of all otomycosis signs and symptoms according to the scales for each individual 
sign or symptom and with absence defined as scores a score of 0 or 1 on each of the scales for pruritus 
and, debris, and scores of 0 on each of the scales for fungal elements, and pa in. 
Other efficacy endpoints will include:  
• Percentage of subjects with clinical cure at the Test of Cure Visit  
• Percentage of subjects with a negative fungal culture at the Test of Cure Visit  
• Percentage of subjects with a negative fungal culture a t the Test  of Cure visit as well as 
individual sign or symptom score of 0 or 1 on each of the scales  for pruritus and debris and a 
score of 0 on each of the scales for fungal elements and pain.  at the Test of Cure Visit  
• Percentage of subjects with a score of 0 or 1 for debris at the Test of Cure Visit  
• Percentage of subjects with individual signs or symptoms with a score of 0 or 1 on each of the 
scales for pruritus and debris and a score of 0 on each of the scales for fungal elements and 
pain the fungal elements at the Test of Cure Visit  
• Percentage of subjects with a score of 0 for pain at the Test of Cure Visit  
• Subject global assessments at Baseline and Test of Cure as well as categorical shifts in the 
subject global assessment scale scores from the Screening/Baseline to the Test of Cure Visit  
• Percentages of subjects with categorical shifts on the subject global assessment scale from the 
Screening/Baseline to the Test of Cure Visit  
• If feasible, analyses may also be conducted by fungal organism  isolated at Screening/Baseline. 
The primary population for all efficacy analyses will be the modified intent -to-treat (MITT) population, 
defined as all subjects who were randomized, dispensed study drug, and with a clinical diagnosis of 
otomycosis and  confirmed by a positive fungal culture  at Screening/Baseline who received at least one 
dose of study drug.

subjects who received at least one dose of st udy drug  and had at least one post -Baseline safety 
assessment.  Safety analyses will include the percentages of subjects with treatment -emergent AEs, 
classified on the basis of Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Affairs (MedDRA) terminology. 
Treatment -emergent AEs will be defined as those occurring upon or after admini stration of the first dose 
of study drug.  
All AEs occurring during the study will be recorded and classified using terminology from the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). All reported treatment- emergent 
adverse events (TEAEs), defined as any AE with an onset on or after the date of first study drug 
application, will be summarized by treatment group. Summaries will provide the number of 
subjects reporting TEAEs, system organ class, preferred term, severity, and relationship to study drug. When summarizing TEAEs by severity or relationship to study drug, each subject will be 
counted only once within a system organ class or a preferred term using the event with the greatest severity or causality, respectively, within each category. All reported SAEs will be 
summarized by the number of subjects reporting the event, system organ class, preferred term, 
severity, and relationship to study drug.

treatment duration, or on Day 22 for subjects randomized to the 14-day treatment durations. In case of 
early termination, the assessments planned for the Test of Cure Visit should be performed if 
possible  
Section 6.4 Test of Cure  
This visit may occur up to 1 day sooner or up to 8 days later than the specified day. Subjects 
randomized to the 7-day group will have the Test of Cure Visit on Day 15, and subjects randomized to 
the 14-day groups will have the Test of Cure Visit on Day 22.  
The following procedures and evaluations will occur during the Test of Cure Visit:  
• Otomycosis signs and symptoms  
• Subject global assessment  
• Microbial (fungal) culture  
• AE evaluation

Section 4.4 Subject Discontinuation  
Due to the time required to obtain fungal culture results from Screening/Baseline, subjects will be 
enrolled into the study based on a clinical diagnosis of otomycosis (including the visible presence of 
fungal elements at Screening/Baseline ), without a requirement for a positive fungal culture.  Subjects 
who end up with a negative Screening/Baseline  fungal culture will not be discontinued from the study, 
but these subjects will not be included in the primary efficacy analysis.

This amendment increases the number of subjects planned, from 36 to 75. This change is being 
implemented to account for a lower than planned percentage of subjects who meet both 
parameters of having a positive fungal culture at Screening/Baseline and completing the Test of 
Cure visit . This amendment also makes corrections to  the Study Schedule (Table 1) and to the 
description of study procedures to be performed at Screening/Baseline (Section 6.2.1) to indicate that study drug is to  be weighed at the Screening/Baseline visit before dispensing study drug to 
the subject; these corrections are for consistency with the Treatment Compliance section (Section 7.11) which requires the study drug to be weighed by the investigator or designee before dispensation to the subject.

Section 3.1 Number of Subjects  
Approximately 36 75 eligible subjects are planned to be enrolled in order to achieve approximately 10 
subjects per group (randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to the 7-day active, 14 -day active, and 14- day vehicle 
treatment groups) with a positive fungal culture at baseline and who have completed the Test of Cure 
Visit. 
Section 4.4 Subject Discontinuation  
Subject discontinuations will be documented clearly on the applicable electronic case report form (eCRF). Subjects who discontinue from the study will not be replaced, but additi onal subjects may be 
enrolled and randomized if it appears that approximately 36 75 subjects is insufficient to meet the 
sponsor’s goal of approximately 10 subjects per group who meet both criteria of having a positive fungal culture at Screening/Baseline and completing the Test of Cure Visit.

This amendment contains the inclusion of an interim analysis to ensure that there is  a sufficient 
number of subjects within each group for the primary analysis. A subject’s MITT status 
(specifically positive fungal culture at baseline) is determined only following random ization , 
which may result in imbalance between treatment groups. Therefore, at least one assessment during the conduct of the study is planned to ensure that there is a sufficient number of subjects within each group for the primary analysis. Once at least  10 MITT subjects have been enrolled in 
the 7-Day active group, the numbers of MITT subjects in the 14 -Day active group and the 14-
Day vehicle group will be determined by an unblinded statistician; no persons involved in the day to day conduct of the study will be unblinded. Randomization allocation for future subjects may be adjusted if deemed necessary to achieve minimum number of subjects within each arm.

Synopsis  
Design and Methodology  
This study is a randomized, partially masked, multiple -dose, parallel -group design study conducted at 
up to 10 study centers in the US. Approximately 75 male or female subjects with otomycosis will 
receive study drug. Subjects will be randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive miconazole oil 
[administered as 5 drops per ear at ~30 mg per drop instilled into the external ear canal of the ear(s) 
affected by otomycosis] for 7 or 14 days, or vehicle for 14 days. During the study it is planned to 
assess treat ment allocation to ensure that there is  a sufficient number of subjects within each 
group for the primary analysis. If deemed necessary , future  randomization s may be adjusted . For 
subjects assigned to the 14 -day treatment duration with either miconazole oil or vehicle, the contents of 
the study drug will be masked to both the subject and the investigator and study staff (i.e., double -
blind), but the treatment duration assigned to each subject (7 or 14 days) will be unmasked to both the 
subject and the investigator and study staff.

Section 3  Study Design  
This study is a randomized, partially masked, multiple -dose, parallel -group design study conducted at 
up to 10 study centers in the US. Approximately 75 male or female subjects with otomycosis will 
receive study drug. Subjects will be randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive miconazole oil [administered as 5 drops per ear at ~30 mg per drop instilled into the external ear canal of the ear(s) 
affected by otomycosis] for 7 or 14 days, or vehicle for 14 days. I nterim assessments are planned to 
ensure that  there is  a sufficient number of subjects within each group for the primary analysis. If 
deemed necessary the randomization ratio may be adjusted following the interim assessment s; see 
Section 10.5.5 for details.  For subjects assigned to the 14-day treatment duration with either 
miconazole oil or vehicle, the contents of the study drug will be masked to both the subject and the investigator and study staff (i.e., double -blind), but the treatment duration assigned to each subject (7 or 
14 days) will be unmasked to both the subject and the investigator and study staff.  
 
Section 9.2 Randomization
 
Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to one of three groups: 1) 7-day treatment with miconazole 
oil; 2) 14 -day treatment with miconazole oil; or 3) 14- day treatment with miconazole oil vehicle. 
Interim assessments are planned to ensure that there is a sufficient number of subjects within 
each group for the primary analysis. If deemed necessary the randomization ratio may be 
adjusted following the interim assessment s; see Section 10.5.5 for details. 
 
Section 10.5.4 Missing Data  
Missing values from th e Test of Cure  visit from which the dichotomized Therapeutic Cure is derived 
will be imputed using last observation carried forward (LOCF) method.estimated by Markov 
Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). The pattern of missing observations in each treatment group cannot 
influence the missing value estimation in the other because the imputation will be conducted 
independently for each treatment group.  
Multiple imputation and subsequent summarization will involve 4 principal tasks:  
Calculate the number of missing Test of Cure values to be estimated by MCMC in each treatment 
group. Let nmiss be the maximum number of missing Test of Cure values among the treatment groups.  
For each treatment group, create a data set containing subjects with observed values and those need ing 
estimation by MCMC. The missing Therapeutic Cure values in each data set will be filled in using the 
MCMC method ‘5 x nmiss’ times to generate ‘5 x nmiss’ data sets. The resulting data set for each 
treatment group will be combined into 1  complete data set for each imputation.

If multiple imputation is impaired due to not sufficient missing data to allow for multiple imputation to 
be performed, multiple imputation may be performed on the computed endpoint rather than the 
individual efficacy assessments. If multiple imputation is still not possible, other sensitivity methods 
may be used such as imputing failure for any missing Therapeut ic Cure determinations.  
 
Section 10.5.5 Interim Treatment Allocation Assessment(s)  
A subject’s MITT status (specifically positive fungal culture at baseline) is determined only 
following randomization, which may result in imbalance between treatment groups . Therefore, at 
least one assessment during the conduct of the study is  planned to ensure that there is  a sufficient 
number of subjects within each group for the primary analysis. Once at least 10 MITT subjects have been enrolled in the 7 -Day active group,  the number s of MITT subjects in the 14 -Day active 
group and the 14 -Day vehicle group will be determined by an unblinded statistician; no persons 
involved in the day to day conduct of the study will be unblinded. R andomization allocation  for 
future subjects may be adjusted if deemed necessary to achieve minimum number of subjects  
within each arm.

Page 3 of 15 Revised Template: November 10, 20141.0 Objectives
The primary objective  of this study is to determine the efficacy of the Life 
Walker versus a standard rollator walker and predicate assistive device on gait function in adults between 18 to 89 year of age and using a walker with or without back pain 
1.1 Hypothesis’s:
Aim 1: Perform in-laboratory training on the Life Walker and testing to 
compare functional gait outcomes with the Life Walker compared 
to a conventional rollator and predicate assistive mobility device. We expect that participants will be able to walk longer and will perform more efficiently on measures of gait function when using the Life Walker. 
Aim 2: Perform in-laboratory testing to compare self-reported pain with 
the Life Walker compared to a conventional rollator and predicate assistive mobility device. We expect that participants will report 
less pain because they will have a more efficient and upright posture when using Life Walker. 
Aim 3: Perform in-laboratory testing to compare measures of quality of 
life with the Life Walker compared to a conventional rollator and predicate mobility device. We expect that participants will report 
better outcomes on quality of life measures because they will experience better self-esteem due to better mobility when using Life Walker.
2.0 Background
More than 6 Million people in the United States use assistive devices such as canes, crutches, or walker to move independently and to improve their balance. Over 1.5 million of these use walkers (Hamid Bateni) (H. Stephen Kaye). Independent movement is one of the most important factors to uphold quality of life for elderly or people with and patients with gait disorder, muscle weakness and musculoskeletal pain.Mobility devices, especially rollators are used for improving the endurance, increasing the walking distance and the walking time (Zorica Suica).  Due to the bilateral stabilization the base of support allows a bigger tolerance for the body mass center till losing balance. Up to 100% are load on the walker, depending on using which allows a decrease lower limb loading and compensate weakness and decrease fatigue. Wheeled Walker (rollator) need less effort for lifting and moving thereby decrease the energy cost up to 50%. (Ko CY; H. Stephen Kaye) Arm-rest can increase the comfort of the walkers and reduce the weight bearing on lower limbs and on hand and wrists additionally (Ko CY). The Life Walker is an ergonomically designed walker with forearm supports at a position which is meant to relieve pressure on important loading parts of a person’s body IRB #: STU00202634 Approved by NU IRB for use on or after 3/9/20 18 through 3/8/2019 .

Page 7 of 15 Revised Template: November 10, 20148.3 Overview: Participants will first complete a series of gait testing. 
Gait testing will include metabolic testing using the K4B2, load and grip testing using load sensors and upper extremity and spine muscle electromyography (EMG) testing. Participants will also be asked to be videotaped during their training sessions. After all the testing is complete, participants will be asked to complete a set of self-report questionnaires.  During each device session, participant heart rate, blood pressure and blood oxygenation will be measured. All of these procedures will be repeated with each device.
8.4 Equipment
•Cosmed  K4B2 Metabolic unit.  Cosmed K4B2 (K4B2 Cosmed, 
Italy) is a portable gas analysis system that measures oxygen 
consumption (VO 2) and Carbon-dioxide production (VCO 2 ) in a 
breath by breath fashion. K4B2 system consists of a portable unit 
and battery pack that weight about 2.4 lbs (1100 gm). The portable 
unit has O 2 and CO 2 analyzers that are bi-directionally connected 
to a flowmeter and turbine attached to a rubber facemask that is 
tightly strapped over subject’s nose and mouth.  K4B2 requires 
calibration before every testing session due to usage of heated 
sensors for measurements. Manufacturer’s recommend at least 45 
minutes warm up time for unit under ambient temperature (ideally 
at 20˚C) before calibration. K4B2 calibration involves verifying 
flowmeter and concentrations of gases with labeled concentrations. 
K4B2 acquires heart rate using a telemetric heart rate sensor that is 
strapped over subject’s thorax. The K4B2 and battery pack can be 
securely placed in slots on a standard harness worn by subject. 
This harness allows access to buttons on the unit on upper back 
and minimal interference to activities like walking. Data extraction 
and processing is carried using K4B2 custom software.
•Electromyography (EMG):  Muscle activity will be 
collected from subjects by electrodes placed upon the skin over lower extremity muscles and also on the lower back muscles. This will be collected during the six-minute walk test. 
•Postural measurement (using EMG) :  Muscle activity 
will be collected from subjects by electrodes placed upon the lower back muscles , upper extremities and lower extremities to measure the posture with each device.
•Grip and forearm strength load – Specialty gloves and 
load cells will be used to measure to amount of load participants are using when using each device on the hands IRB #: STU00202634 Approved b y NU IRB for use on or a fter 3/9/2018 throu gh 3/8/2019 .

Device
Page 8 of 15 Revised Template: November 10, 2014and also on the forearm. This will be collected during the 
six-minute walk test.
•Activity monitors will be placed on the body or walker to collect 
body movement data.
•HR/BP: Subjects will wear a heart rate monitor during the study 
and blood pressure will be taken periodically with a standard BP cuff.
8.5 Clinical Testing
•10 METER TIMED WALK (10mWT):  This test will 
examine the patient’s gait speed. Patients will be directed to walk at a self-selected speed and at their preferred maximum but safe speed. Patients will be positioned 1 meter before the start line and instructed to walk the entire distance and past the end line approximately 1 meter. The distance before and after the course are meant to minimize the effect of acceleration and deceleration. Time will be recorded using a stopwatch and recorded to the one hundredth of a second (ex: 2.15 sec). The test will be recorded 3 times each, with adequate rest in between. The average of the 3 times should be recorded. Participants will complete the 10mWT 6 times with each device: 3 times 
Self-selected; 3 times Fast-walking
•6 MINUTE WALK TEST (6MWT):  The 6 minute walk 
test is performed as an objective evaluation of functional exercise capacity. The 6minute walk test is easy to administer, well tolerated, and typically reflective of activities of daily living. The test measures the distance that the patient can walk on a flat, hard surface, indoors, in a period of 6 minutes. The walk test is patient self-paced and assesses the level of functional capacity. Patients are allowed to stop and rest during the test, however, the timer does not stop. If the patient is unable to complete the time, the time stopped is noted and reason for stopping prematurely is recorded. We will record the number of stops and stumbles during the test. This test will be administered while wearing a mask to measure oxygen consumption in addition to blood pressure, heart rate and oxygen saturation.
•TALKS WHILE WALKING TEST (TWWT Dual Task 
Test) :  The TWWT is used to determine the effects of 
cognitive attentional demands during walking by IRB #: STU00202634 Approved by NU IRB for use on or after 3/9/20 18 through 3/8/2019 .

walking. Participants will perform the following tasks, timed walking up to 50 meters, performing a thinking and talking (numerical and/or vocabulary) task while sitting and a dual task while walking (i.e. performing a thinking and talking task while walking). Participants voice will be recorded when performing all the thinking and talking tasks .
•GAITRITE DATA CAPTURE:  The GAITRite system 
automates measuring temporal and spatial gait parameters via an electronic walkway connected to a computer. The GAITRite electronic walkway contains sensor pads encapsulated in a carpet to collect gait information. The system can be laid over any flat surface. The GAITRite electronic walkway for the study shall be a minimum of 14 feet long. The GAITRite data capture was chosen as measurement of the patient’s overall gait quality. Patients will be asked to walk at a self-selected speed across the GAITRite electronic walkway. GAITRite. Participants will complete the GAITRite 6 times with each device: 3 times 
Self-selected; 3 times Fast-walking
•OUTDOOR AMBULATION:  All participants will 
complete a structured outdoor course of straight walkway, ramps, and a standard side walk with curbs as well as a crosswalk. Time and RPE will be measured.
•DYNAMIC GAIT INDEX (DGI). The DGI is  clinical test 
that assesses the individual’s ability to modify balance 
while walking with the walkers in the presence of external demands (i.e. demands like, level walking, look up amd down, left and right while walking, stepping over and walking around obstacles and cones). 
8.6 Self-Report Questionnaires
•MODIFIED FALLS EFFICACY SCALE (mFES):  The mFES 
is self-report questionnaire consisting of 14 items which is designed to measure fear of falling in the elderly. It assesses an individual’s perception of balance during activities of daily living by asking “how confident are you that you can do the following activities without falling.” 
•MODIFIED FATIGUE IMPACT SCALE (mFIS): The mFIS is 
a 21-item short version of perceived impact of fatigue on the subscales of physical, cognitive, and psychosocial functioning.IRB #: STU00202634 Approved by NU IRB for use on or after 3/9/20 18 through 3/8/2019 .

WITH ASSISTIVE TECHNOLOGY (QUEST)  was designed to 
measure the level of satisfaction attribute to assistive technologies. It does so using 27 variables which are scored in terms of perceived importance and satisfaction.
•VISUAL ANALOG PAIN SCALE (VAS):  The Visual Analog 
Scale Pain Scale is a measure of perceived pain intensity. It consists of a horizontal line that is 10 centimeters long. On either side of the line is a description of pain- to the left the description will read “No pain,” and to the right the description will read “worst pain imaginable.”  The individual is instructed to mark a point on the continuum which represents his/her pain.
•QUEBEC BACK PAIN DISABILITY Scale: The back pain 
scale is a self-report measure that evaluates a patient’s functional status related to back pain. 
•BORG RATE OF PERCEIVED EXERTION: 6-20 item scale 
that measures perceived exertion during activity.
•USER FUNCTIONAL RATING SCALE: Is specifically to 
assess the user’s perception of difficulty in performing the functional tasks when using the different assistive devices. The scale is similar to the patient specific functional scale wherein functional tasks are rated in level of their difficulty from “0” (“inability to perform the task”) to “10” (“no difficulty in performing the task.”). 
•Brief Pain Inventory: This scale is a 9-item self-report measure of 
measure of perceived pain intensity at different body parts in the past 24 hours.
•Rosenberg’s Self-Esteem Scale :
The Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale is a 10-item self-report measure of global 
self-esteem. It consists of 10 statements related to overall feelings of self-
worth or self-acceptance. The items are answered on a four-point scale 
ranging from strongly agree to strongly disagree

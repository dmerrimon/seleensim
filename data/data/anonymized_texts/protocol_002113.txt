This descriptive study is intended to provide feedback from participant s about their 
experience using the lebrikizumab  pen when delivering a simulated injection into an injection 
pad. The participant ’s experience will be evaluated based on their responses to the modified 
Subcutaneous Administration Assessment Questionnaire ( mSQAAQ) , a PRO questionnaire  
for evaluating one’s experience (e.g., ease of use and confidence in using)  with a device to 
administer a SC injection.9,10 
 
Participant s will perform a simulated injection and provide their feedback on the experience.  
The participants  will perform the tasks independently after training by the study team. Since 
there is active drug in the pen , the site staff will remain in the room with the participant  
during their simulated injection into the injection pad. After the simulated injection, a trained 
study site staff  will distribute  the mSQAAQ for the participant to complete independently 
onsite .

12APR 2024_v1.0  14 Concentrics Research,  
 CONFIDENTIAL  an IQVIA Business  5 BACKGROUND   
5.1 Description of the Drug Product  
Lebrikizumab (LY3650150) is an IgG4 mAb that binds with high affinity and slow off -rate 
to IL -13 and selectively inhibits IL -13 signaling through the IL -4Rα/IL -13Rα1 pathway, 
thereby blocking the downstream effects of IL -13 with high potency. Lebrikizumab- bound 
IL-13 can still bind IL -13Rα2, allowing subsequent internalization and natural clearance of 
IL-13. Blockade of IL -13 signaling is expected to be of benefit in diseases in which IL -13 is 
a central cytokine to the disease pathogenesis, such as  atopic dermatitis ( AD). 
Lebrikizumab has been investigated for the treatment of AD, asthma, COPD, IPF, and RHL. 
Currently, lebrikizumab is being actively developed for the treatment of AD. Lebrikizumab is also being investigated for the treatment of perennial allergic rhinitis (P AR) and chronic 
rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) . 
An Investigator’s  Brochure  for the drug provides a summary of the clinical studies conducted 
for lebrikizumab  and the associated findings .  
5.2 Description of the Investigational Device  
The lebrikizumab pen has a drug product container assembled inside the pen  (Figure 1 ). The 
combined container and pen  form a prefilled, single -use, injection device that delivers a fixed 
dose of drug product subcutaneously. The drug will remain in the container until the drug is injected. The pen  uses a fixed needle injection depth that is inserted perpendicular to the skin 
without the need to raise a skinfold (i.e., a flat -surface injection) to deliver an SC injection.  
 To facilitate understanding of the operation of the pen, refer to Figure 1
 and the J2T-MC-
KGBY instructions for use  (IFU). Further guidance and information for the final disposition 
of unused study interventions are provided in the Pharmacy Manual7 and Dose Preparation  
Instructions8. 
 The solution in the pen requires storage under refrigerated conditions (2
oC to 8oC). Prior to 
use, the pen is removed from the refrigerator and allowed to warm to room temperature for 
45 minutes.  The pen can remain at room temperature for up to 8 hours. If the pen is not used 
within the allowed timeframe, it should be returned to refrigerated conditions and the temperature excursion process should be followed.  Further guidance on the excursion process 
is provided in the Pharmacy Manual
7.  
 The pen is prepared by removing the Twist -off Cap that pulls the syringe needle shield off.  
The pen base is placed flat and firmly onto the patient’s skin at the injection site. The base of 
the device helps to orient the needle perpendicular to the skin.  After placement on the skin, 
Protocol #23037/J2T -MC-KGBY    
 
12APR 2024_v1.0  15 Concentrics Research,  
 CONFIDENTIAL  an IQVIA Business  the device is unlocked by turning the Lock Ring to align the raised plastic feature (lock 
indicator) to the Unlock Symbol. The device can be activated only when the lock indicator is aligned with the Unlock Symbol.  The user activates the device by pressing the Injection 
Button. This generates an audible and tactile click and the device automatically performs the following steps:  
 
1. Inserts needle into the skin  
2. Injects the solution  
3. Delays needle retraction to ensure complete delivery  
4. Retracts the needle.  
 The user must hold the device firmly against the skin during the injection cycle but is not required to maintain pressure on the Injection Button. The device generates an audible and tactile click at the end of the needle retraction process. The device locks the retracted needle in place for disposal of the used pen  into a sharp container.  
 The pen was developed according to the requirements established by the ISO and standards 
for needle -based injection systems for medical use (ISO 11608- 1 and ISO 11608- 5). An 
Investigator’s Brochure for the device outlines the testing and associated findings for the device.

 CONFIDENTIAL  an IQVIA Business  5.3 Intended Participant Environment  
The participant environment will be non- clinical and emulate the noise, lighting,  and 
surroundings of a home environment.  In order to observe the participant s, the rooms are 
equipped with 1- way mirrors, cameras,  and remote monitoring equipment.   
5.4 Rationale for Study Design  
Autoinjectors ( AI) and prefilled syringes ( PFS)  are commonly accepted as safe and effective 
for their intended use.  Thus, the development of the AI  to deliver  lebrikizumab is based on 
the evidence of benefit, as observed in similar approved AIs.  Whereas other commercially 
available A Is are designed to deliver 1 mL of the drug product , the lebrikizumab AI is 
designed to deliver 2 mL of the study drug.  The 2 -mL AI has been used in the lebrikizumab 
clinical development program in  Studies J2T-DM-KGAA (KGAA) and J2T -MC-KGBG 
(KGBG).4  The results of these studies demonstrate that the 2- mL AI is a viable device for 
the SC administration of lebrikizumab.  The 2-mL AI for delivering lebrikizumab will be 
referred to as the lebrikizumab pen for the purposes of this study.  
The study design for the current ease of use study is  descriptive in nature ( 51 participant s) 
and intended to provide relevant information about the participant  experience with the 
lebrikizumab  pen. The population will be comprised of individuals with AD with no prior AI  
or pen experience, although those with experience with other injectables will be permitted .  
Evaluation of the participant ’s experience will be based on  the mSQAAQ9,10, an instrument 
for assessing ease of use and confidence in use  of a subcutaneous device .    
5.5 Study Benefit and Risk Assessment  
While there are no direct therapeutic benefits to participant s participating in this study, the 
results from this study will offer valuable insights into the participant ’s experience with the  
lebrik izumab  pen as related to ease of use and confidence in injection . The risk s associated 
with participation in this study will be minimized because the simulated  injections will be 
performed into injection  pads and participants will be under the direct supervision of study 
staff when handling the injection devices. Participants are not injecting themselves in this

The following is a list of potential risks associated with participation in this study:   
• Accidental needle stick injury   
• Accidental exposure to drug product (accidental self -injection)   
Protocol #23037/J2T -MC-KGBY    
 
12APR 2024_v1.0  18 Concentrics Research,  
 CONFIDENTIAL  an IQVIA Business  • Injection site reaction or hypersensitivity event associated with exposure to drug 
product via accidental injection   
The following is a list of potential risks associated with the study devices:   
• Improper functioning and/or mechanical failure of the device or its components (for example, no injection, slow injection into injection  pad, partial injection into injection  
pad, cracked syringes, high force to operate device, damaged needle)   
• Skin reaction due to exposure of drug product on skin   
5.7 Methods to Minimize Risks  
Training on the study device will be provided by study staff prior to the participant 
performing the simulated injection. Training for correct sharps handling/disposal is part of the study training, and no cross contamination is expected due to each partic ipant receiving 
their own device, as well as injecting drug into a n injection  pad. Participants will be 
instructed to place the base  cap in the sharps container once it is removed from the device,  so 
they do not have the temptation to recap. Study staff wi ll monitor the participants at all times 
in the room and intervene should a dangerous situation occur.   
Participants will be under direct supervision of the study staff when handling the device.    
The following controls will be in place to prevent an accidental  dose of drug product :  
1. The participants will only handle the devices under direct supervision of study staff 
after receiving training.   
2. Participants will be told that they should not inject themselves, and these devices will only be used for simulated injections into an injection pad.   
3. If a participant appears to begin injecting themselves rather than the injection pad, the 
site staff will immediately interrupt the process and stop the participant from 
completing this self -injection.   
4. In the unlikely circumstance that a participant does have an accidental needle stick or 
accidental injection, it is not likely the participant would receive a full dose since a full dose takes up to 15 seconds for delivery.     
If a needlestick injury occurs or if a patient is exposed to drug, medical personnel will be 
available to address any potential medical issues or concerns. Clinical staff members will follow (monitor) the participant as per clinical judgment for a potentia l adverse event (AE) 
and follow the appropriate device -reporting procedures for 7 days following  the visit.

6.1 Overall Trial and Design and Plan  
This study is an open- label, single site , ease of use study of the lebrikizumab pen and consists 
of a single study visit for approximately 56 adult participants. All participants will receive 
training and perform simulated  injections on a practice pad using the pen .  Participants will 
be under the supervision of a study interviewer when handling the pen and will complete the 
mSQAAQ9,10 following the simulated  injection.  
No treatment will be administered to the participants.  
6.2 Administrative Structure of the Trial 
This is a n ease- of-use study (with a simulated injection ) with a planned analysis population 
of 51 participant s. The participant  will be taken to a non- clinical observation room equipped 
with a 1 -way mirror and cameras. The setting is a non- clinical setting arranged similar to a 
home environment with similar lighting and sound.  
The participant  will be given training on the use of the pen and then given an opportunity to 
simulate administration of a dose into an injection pad.  Following the injection experience, 
the participant  will self -administer the m SQAAQ9,10.  
6.3 Selection of Participant Population  
The participant s will be recruited from the site database. A log of all participant s enrolled 
into the study (i.e. having signed the Informed Consent Form) will be maintained by the 
research site. Minimal personal health information (PHI) will be gathered which will include  
the approximate dat e of their AD diagnosis, any previous or current treatments , any known 
experience with  administering drugs by injection  to self or others , and if the individual is of 
child -bearing potential  (see Section 9.2.1 ) , they will be tested to rule out pregnancy give n 
the risk of accidental  exposure to drug.  
Individuals who self -report having been diagnosed with AD will be pre -screened by phone 
based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria . Those who qualify (i.e. inclusion criteria apply, 
and exclusion criteria do not apply) will be scheduled for a 1- visit study at the research  site. 
The enrolled  study population of  approximately N=56 will be comprised of adults, ages 18 
and older.  
While there will be no other assigned quota groups, additional characteristics of the study population will be diverse and  may include  age, gender, education, literacy, or other patient 
characteristics.

9.2 Details of Study Procedures  
9.2.1 Recruitment and Pre-Screening  
Participant s will be recruited by the research site who will access their site database 
comprised individuals who have participated in previous studies and/or expressed interest in 
participating in future studies .  Potential participant s will be pre -screened by phone with the 
inclusion and exclusion criteria  including any previous pen experience.  Participant s who 
qualify (i.e. inclusion criteria apply, and exclusion criteria do not apply) will be referred to 
the research site.    
9.2.2 Visit 1 
This is a single center , single visit  simulated  use study.  All participant s will be completed at 
the end of Visit 1.  There is no treatment period; this study involves a simulated injection with a pen  device into an injection pad  followed by a self -administered questionnaire 
(mSQAAQ)
9,10 about the participant ’s experience.   
9.2.3 Enrollment and Visit 1 Activities 
Participant s arriving at the research site will be given an informed consent document  to read 
and sign. The participant  will be given an opportunity to ask any questions and will be 
reminded that participation is voluntary and that the option exists to withdraw at any time . 
Inclusion and exclusion criteria will be re -confirmed as well as demographic information and 
previous pen experience; for this study,  all participants are required to be pen  and AI  naïve 
(i.e., no prior experience with a pen  or AI ). 
Participants who were assigned female at birth (AFAB) will be asked to take a urine 
pregnancy test to confirm they are not pregnant . Individuals not of childbearing potential 
(INOCBP) will be exempt from a urine pregnancy test. Individuals AFAB are considered 
INOCBP if they are not capable of producing ova or embryo, and/or are not capable of potentially gestating a fetus. Such indivi duals include those who have a congenital anomaly 
such as Müllerian agenesis resulting in confirmed infertility, are infertile due to surgical sterilization, or are menopausal. Acceptable surgical sterilization methods are hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo -oophorectomy, bilateral salpingectomy, or bilateral oophorectomy.

10.1 Data Collection 
Case Report Form (CRF) d ata will be collected using a 21 CFR Part 11 compliant electronic 
data capture system  (EDC) , the IQVIA Research Management Platform  (RMP)  v2.6. Data 
from recruitment and pre -screening  will be captured separately  and not entered into the RMP 
EDC system . Since the study is being conducted in person, a paper informed consent and a 
paper 24- hour SAE report form will be used.  
CRF data will include:  
• Confirmation of inclusion and exclusion criteria  
• Participant demographics  
• REALM2 score  
• Confirmation of pen /AI experience (i.e., pen /AI naïve, any other experience with 
injectables)  
• Pregnancy test results for participants AFAB unless considered I NOCBP   
• Brief medical history (approximate date of AD diagnosis and previous or current 
treatments)  
• Responses to the 10 questions in the m SQAAQ9,10 
• Adverse events (AE)  
• Serious adverse events (SAE)  
10.2 Sample Size 
The planned final  sample size of 51 is sufficient to provide descriptive insights about the 
study population. Given the nature of the study it is expected that %+ of participants 
enrolled will complete the study and provide full analyzable data.  
 Under the assumption that % of the participants will respond “agreed” or “strongly 
agreed” to the device being “easy to use” and  “they are confident they can use the device” we 
will have 95% confidence that the response rate is located in this range of proportions : [% 
- %]. Table 3 shows a variety of possible sample sizes . For the purpose of the intended 
claims the 95% CI lower bound should remain above %, preferably above %, and the parameters for the calculation of sample size have been selected for that.

A descriptive analysis will be conducted to assess the ease of use and confidence of use  of the 
lebrikizumab  pen. All participant s having given an informed consent will be included in the 
analysis population.  
The main endpoint of the study will be assessed via the mSQAAQ9,10. The primary outcome 
reported from each individual question will be  the proportion of participants responding 
“agreed” or “strongly agreed” to the question. Participants who do not complete an individual 
item in the mSQAAQ will have their remaining questions analyzed per instrument instruction s.  
Collected demographic information and health literacy level  of study participants will be 
presented for the total analysis population as well as any selected sub -populations. A 
descriptive analysis of any AEs and/or  product complaints reported during the study will be 
included for the total analysis population.

 CONFIDENTIAL  an IQVIA Business  12 Safety  
12.1 Adverse Event Definition  
An AE is defined  as any untoward medic al occurrence in a participant  or clinical  
investigation  (vital signs, physical change, etc.)  that does not  necessarily  have  a causal 
relationship with the treatment. An AE can be any unfavorable  or unintended  sign 
(including an abnor mal finding on vital signs, physical change, etc. ), symptom,  or disease  
temporally  associated  with the use of an IP,  whet her or not related  to the IP. 
This includes  any adverse occurrence that is new in onset or aggravate d in severit y, duration,  
or frequency  from  the baseline condition (including  the physi cal exam ination),  or abnor mal 
results  of diagnostic  procedures  (including vital sign  abnor malities).  
Examples of untoward medical events  that should be considered  AEs are those that : 
• result ed in discontinuation from  the study,  
• require d treatment or any other  therapeutic  intervention,  
• require d further diagnostic  evaluation  (excluding a repetitio n of the same 
procedure  to confirm  the abnor mality), 
• are associated  with clinical  signs  or symptom s judged by the Investigator  to 
have  a significant  clinical impact.  
Examples of what an AE  is not: 
• A surgica l procedure  
• A situation  where an untoward event  did not occur,  (e.g. a social  
hospitalization)  
• The disease  being studied,  unless  progress ion is more sever e than anticipated  
•  Baseline conditions  that have  not worsene d in severit y or frequency  
• Abnormal findings or test results (unless considered clinically significant in the 
opinion of the investigator or specifically defined elsewhere in the protocol)  
related to the disease  being studied (unless  more severe than expected).  
12.2 Adverse Device Effect Definition 
An adverse device effect (ADE) is any adverse event related to the use of an investigational 
medical device (This definition includes adverse events resulting from insufficient or inadequate instructions  for use, deployment, implantation, installation, or operation, or any 
malfunction of the investigational  medical device. Includes any event resulting from use 
error or from intentional misuse of the investigational medical device. Also includes ‘comparator’ if the comparator is a medical device.) .

12APR 2024_v1.0  33 Concentrics Research,  
 CONFIDENTIAL  an IQVIA Business  12.3 Procedures  
Adverse events will be gathered from the point that the informed consent is signed until 
participant  leaves site on date of visit. Participant s with unrelated adverse events will be 
followed for 7- days post AE . All SAEs, and related AEs will be followed until the event has 
resolved.  This is a 1 -visit study.  
A description of the event or diagnosis including dates, severity, relationship to the device and/or IP, action taken and outcome, and whether or not the event was also serious, must be 
reported on the AE Case Report Form ( CRF ) for each adverse event.  
12.4 Severity 
Adverse events are graded according to seriousness and severity.  The seriousness of an event 
is determined by the regulatory criteria in Section 13.7.  
The Investigator will evaluate the severity  of each AE. Adverse event  severity  will be graded 
as follows:  
Mild:   Awareness of symptoms but easily tolerated  
Moderate:  Discomfort enough to interfere with but not prevent daily activity  
Severe:  Unable to perform usual activity  
12.5 Relationship  
The Investigator will judge the likelihood that the AE was related to the  device or IP   
according to the following criteria:  
• Not related: There is no possible temporal and/or causal relationship to the 
device or IP  
• Related: There is a possible temporal and/ or causal relationship to the device or 
IP  
12.6 Action Taken and Outcome 
 Action Taken with IP or device will not be collected given the nature of this study.  The 
Outcome  of each AE will be entered as either: Recovered/Resolved, Recovered/Resolved 
with Sequelae, Not Recovered/Not Resolved, Fatal, or Unknown.  
12.7 Adverse Event Follow-up  
Investigators will follow unrelated AEs until 7- days after the study visit.  All SAEs, and 
related AEs will be followed until the event has resolved.

 CONFIDENTIAL  an IQVIA Business  12.8 Serious Adverse Events  
An AE or ADE that results in any of the following outcomes is serious:  
• Death (note that death is the outcome of an SAE,  and the cause of death should 
be listed as the AE)  
• Life-threatening event. An event, in the view of either the investigator or 
sponsor, which places the patient or participant  at immediate risk of death. (It 
does not include an adverse event or suspected adverse reaction that, had it 
occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death)  
• In-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
• A persistent  or significant  incapacity, permanent damage or disability  or 
substa ntial disru ption  of the ability  to conduct  normal life functions  
• Congenital  anomaly or birth  defect  
• Other  important  medical  event  that may not result  in death,  be life-threatening,  
or require  hospitalization  may be considered  serious  when,  based  upon 
appropriate  medical  judgm ent, it may jeopardize the participant  or may require  
medical  or surgical  intervention to preve nt one of the outcom es listed  in this 
definition.  
• Hospitalization  for elective surgery  for a prior condition that did not worsen  or 
for soci al reasons will not be treated as serious.  
A serious adverse device effect (SADE) is a serious event that has resulted in any of the consequences characteristic of a serious adverse event.  For the purpose of this study,  the term 
SAE will include SADEs.  
12.8.1  Serious Adverse Event Reporting  
Any SAE  which  occurs  after the Informed Consent document is signed until participant  
leaves site on date of visit  must be reported to  Lilly . Lilly must be notifi ed within  24 hours  
after the site/investigator  becomes aware of the SAE.   
If the Principal Investigator  determines that the event  is serious,  the following procedures 
will be implemented:  
• The Investigator  will report  the SAE  directly  to Lilly . Contacts for SAE 
reporting can be found in site training materials.  
• Investi gator  will provide,  at a minimum, the protocol  number,  participant ’s 
initials,  participant  number, date of the SAE, SAE  term and relationship  to IP 
and/or device . The SAE  report form  should be submitted with any supporting 
data available or copies of CRF  pages.  
• Advarra  IRB will be notified of the SAE  by the site within  the timef rames 
described  below:  
Protocol #23037/J2T -MC-KGBY    
 
12APR 2024_v1.0  35 Concentrics Research,  
 CONFIDENTIAL  an IQVIA Business  1. Unantici pated  proble ms that are serious  adverse events  should be 
reporte d to the IRB withi n 10 business days  of the investigat or 
becom ing aware of the  event . 
2. Any other  unanticipated  problem  should be reported to the IRB within  
10 business days of  the investigator  beco ming aware of the proble m. 
An initial  report  followed  prom ptly by a complete  report  will be forwarded  to Advarra  IRB. 
12.8.2  Serious Adverse Event Follow-up  
Investigators  will follow all SAEs  until the  SAE  has resolved.  
The Investi gator  and Medical  Monitor  will determine if additional  follow-up is required. 
Follow -up information  relating  to an SAE  must be submitted to Lilly  as soon as additiona l 
data related  to the event are available.  All efforts  must be taken  to obtain follow -up 
infor mation  prom ptly. 
Follow -up infor mation  may consist  of: 
• A hospital  discharge  summary  for participant s who are hospitalized  or 
hospitalized  over a prolonged  period  due to the SAE. If possible,  the discharge  
summary  should be obtained when  it beco mes available.  
• A copy of the autopsy report,  if a death  occurs  and an autopsy is perform ed, 
should be obtained if possible  when it beco mes available.  
Any SAE that is ongoing at the end of visit 1 should be followed as described above. Data 
after visit 1 should be recorded on the source documents and submitted to Lilly  on an SAE  
report form. For ongoing SAEs, the Principal Investigator must submit follow -up reports 
to Lilly  regarding the participant ’s subsequent course until the case is closed.  
12.9 Unexpected Adverse Event  
As defined by 21 CFR 312.32 (a), an unexpected adverse drug experience is:  
“An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “unexpected” if it is not 
listed in the investigator brochure or is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been 
observed; or, if an investigator brochure is not required or available , is not consistent with 
the risk information described in the general investigational plan or elsewhere in the current application, as amended. For example, under this definition, hepatic necrosis would be unexpected (by virtue of greater severity) if the  investigator brochure referred 
only to elevated hepatic enzymes or hepatitis. Similarly, cerebral thromboembolism and cerebral vasculitis would be unexpected (by virtue of greater specificity) if the investigator brochure listed only cerebral vascular accidents. “Unexpected,” as used in this definition, also refers to adverse events or suspected adverse reactions that are mentioned in the 
Protocol #23037/J2T -MC-KGBY    
 
12APR 2024_v1.0  36 Concentrics Research,  
 CONFIDENTIAL  an IQVIA Business  investigator brochure as occurring with a class of drugs or as anticipated from the 
pharmacological properties of the drug but are not specifically mentioned as occurring with the particular drug under investigation.”  
The study sponsor will expedite reporting all serious unexpected suspected adverse reactions (SUSARs): initial reporting by the sponsor for nonfatal or non- life threatening 
SUSARs must be submitted as soon as possible but no later than within 15 calendar days following the sponsor’s initial receipt of the information, and for fatal or life -threatening 
SUSARs, initial reports must be submitted no later tha n 7 calendar days following the 
sponsor’s initial receipt of the information. Any relevant additional information obtained by the sponsor that pertains to a previously submitted IND safety report must be submitted as a Follow -up IND Safety Report without delay as soon as the information is available but no 
later than 15 calendar days after the sponsor receives the information.  
Such expedited reports will comply with the applicable regulatory requirements and with the FDA’s Guidance for Industry and Investigators Safety Reporting Requirements for INDs and BA/BE Studies (21 CFR 312.32).  
12.9.1  Unanticipated Adverse Device Effect  
As defined by 21 CFR 812.3 ( s), an unanticipated adverse device effect (UADE)  is: 
"any serious adverse effect on health or safety or any life -threatening problem or death 
caused by, or associated with, a device, if that effect, problem, or death was not previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the investigati onal plan or 
application (including a supplementary plan or application),  or any other unanticipated 
serious problem associated with a device that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of participant s." 
The PI will report evaluation results for any unanticipated adverse device effect per 21 CFR 812.150 (b)(1) within 10 days working days to the reviewing IRB(s).  
All unanticipated adverse device effects will be evaluated and reported as warranted  within 
10 working days after sponsor first receives notice of the effect per  21 CFR 812. 46 (b) and  
21 CFR  812.150 (b)(1) . 
12.9.2  Definition of Product Complaints  
A product complaint is any written, electronic, or oral communication that alleges deficiencies related to the identity, quality, durability, reliability, safety, effectiveness,  or 
performance of a study intervention.  When the ability to use the study intervention safely is 
impacted, the following are also product complaints:  
• deficiencies in labeling information  
Protocol #23037/J2T -MC-KGBY    
 
12APR 2024_v1.0  37 Concentrics Research,  
 CONFIDENTIAL  an IQVIA Business  • use errors for device or drug- device combination products due to ergonomic 
design elements of the product.  
Product complaints related to study interventions used in clinical trials are collected to ensure 
the safety of participants, monitor quality, and to facilitate process and product 
improvements.  
If the participant identifies a product complaint or a problem with the study intervention, 
investigators will instruct participants to contact the site as soon as possible so that the 
situation can be assessed.  
An event may meet the definition of both a product complaint and an AE/SAE. In such cases, it should be reported as both a product complaint and as an AE/SAE.  
Device deficiencies are product complaints.  
12.9.3  Recording and Follow-Up of AE and/or SAE and Product Complaints  
When an AE/SAE /product complaint occurs, it is the responsibility of the investigator to 
review all documentation (for example, hospital progress notes, laboratory reports, and 
diagnostics reports) related to the event.  
The investigator will then record all relevant AE/ SAE/product complaint information in the 
participant’s medical records, in accordance with the investigator’s normal clinical practice. 
AE/SAE information is reported on the appropriate CRF page and product complaint 
information is reported on the Product Complaint Form.  
Note: An event may meet the definition of both a product complaint and an AE/SAE. In such cases, it should be reported as both a product complaint and as an AE/SAE.  
It is not  acceptable for the investigator to send photocopies of the participant’s medical 
records to the sponsor or designee in lieu of completion of the CRF page for AE/SAE and the 
Product Complaint Form for product complaints.  
There may be instances when copies of medical records for certain cases are requested by the 
sponsor or designee. In this case, all participant identifiers, with the exception of the 
participant number, will be redacted on the copies of the medical records  before submission 
to the sponsor or designee.  
The investigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, symptoms, and/or other clinical information. Whenever possible, the diagnosis (not the individual signs/symptoms) will be documented as the AE/SAE.

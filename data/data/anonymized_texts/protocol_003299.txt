Confidential  Page  2 of 165 SUMMARY  OF CHANGES FROM CLINICAL STUDY PROTOCOL  
VERSION 14 
REASON(S) FOR THIS AMEND MENT  
The primary reason s for this amendment are to amend LYMRIT -37-01 as follows :  
1. To add Part C  (Pharmacokinetic Cohort) to better characterise the pharmacokinetics of 
Betalutin and total lilotomab  antibodies in patients treated with Betalutin 15 MBq /kg and 
lilotomab 40 mg, who are willing and able to provide pharmacokinetic samples  due to 
limited available data from Part A and Part B . This change affects the entire protocol , 
including clarifications to inclusion and exclusion where appropriate to def ine applicability 
to Part s A,B and C of the study; Section  7.1.1  and Section  7.2.1 . Section 4.8.6  has been 
introduced to clarify the rational e for the Part C population. 
2. To clarify the management of dose finding in the subpopulation s of patients in Part B with 
prior autologous stem cell transplant (SCT) and/or platelet  count ≥ 100×109/L but 
<150 ×109/L, including determination of the recommended dose  regimen s for these 
populations. Protocol V ersion 14 introduced the possibility to adapt the dose regimen in 
these subpopulations, without specif ic rules . Dose determination in the defined 
subpopulations will be managed using a “modified “3+3” design. The first 3 patients in 
each subpopulation will be treated with a lower dose of Betalutin  and treatment decisions 
for subsequent patients will be made following review of the data by th e SRC  (as planned 
in V ersion 14) . This change predominantly affects Section  4.2.3 , Section  4.2.4 , 
Section  4.8.7.1 , Section  4.8.10 , Section  6.1 and Section  6.2. A major related clarification 
has been added throughout the protocol that the subpopulation s with a lower platelet count s 
have counts in the range ≥100×109/L but <150×109/L. 
3. To update the study hypothesis and objectives of Part B subsequent to the selection of the 
recommended phase II dose for further development implemented in Version 14 of the 
protocol: 
• Update to the Part B primary and secondary objectives  to clearly identify those 
specific to the randomised section and those specific to the selected dose for further 
development ; Section  5.3.1  and Section  5.3.2  
• Revision to the Part B sample size  to reflect termination of dosing with the “100/20” 
treatment regimen  and set a hypothesis and sample size for assessment of the  “40/15” 
treatment regimen  selected for further development . Patient enrolment in Part B will 
be completed when a total of 87 patients have received the regimen selected for 
further development (including patients from the randomised section of Part B ) 
Section  6.1 and Section  14.1.2  
• Addition of secondary objectives and endpoints for Part B (complet e response rate 
[CRR] and duration of complete response [DoCR ]); Section 5.3.2 , Section 5.6 and 
Section 14.1.7 . Specification that overall response rate ( ORR ) will be evaluated by  
the investigator as a secondary endpoint (this was an omission) and that CRR, 
duration of response ( DoR) , DoCR and progression free survival ( PFS) will be 
assessed by independent review and by the investigator.

Version 1 5.1 
19 February  2021 
 
Confidential  Page  3 of 165 Other key changes inclu ded in the amendment are  detailed below. The rational for each change 
is: 
4. Change of Chief Medical Officer  and biostatistician  and removal of the telephone number 
of the Coordinating Investigator from the signature page as subject to changes between 
version s of the protocol.  
5. Introduction of (i) flexibility to the screening period (based on Sponsor approval) beyond 
4 weeks due to unforeseen delays and (ii) possibility of perform ing study visits without key 
assessments as non -hospital visits , Section  6.3. These changes do not impact the 
assessment of the key study endpoints but allow for a safer management of patients affected 
by the Coronavirus Disease  19 (COVID-19) pandemic restrictions.  
6. Revisions to inclusion and exclusion criteria  based on queries and feedback from study 
sites and to clarify ambiguities, without changing the overall study population 
characteristics  and requirements Section  7.1.2  and Section  7.2.2 . This include s: 
• Clarification of the definitions of refractoriness a nd prior 2 lines of therapies 
qualifying for study entry. The inclusion requirements have not been changed, only 
reworded to prevent misinterpretation. 
• Acceptance that systemic anti -neoplastic regimens including agents such as idelalisib 
or other PI3K inhibitors qualify as a prior line of therapy.  
• Removing the requirement for a patient to be without grade≥1 Graft versus Host 
Disease when they have had prior autologous -SCT which was previously included in 
error; Section  4.2.4 , Section  4.7 and Section  7.2.2 . 
• Modifying the exclusion criterion for prior cancers. Exceptions to this inclusion 
criterion were  imprecise and not adapted to changes in treatment outcomes for certain 
cancers  since protocol was first written . Exceptions have been clarified and 
homogenised, still ensuring that only patients with  no or  very low risk of rel apse 
during the course of the study are entered . 
• Ensuring that absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥1.5×109/L and platelet count 
≥100×109/L (Part B) and ≥100×109/L (Part C)  are satisfied within 72 hours of the 
administration of rituximab. Haematology testing has been added prior to 
administration of rituximab to fulfill this requirement ( Section 6.3  – Table 6.8  and 
Section 9.6.2.1 ).  
7. Starting further therapy has been removed  as an option for withdrawal from the study ; 
Section  8. Patients enter limited  (long term ) follow-up when they have disease progression 
or start anot her cancer t reatment  (whichever comes first). This follow-up allows  for 
long- term toxicities of Betalutin, to be captured and managed which is important for the 
patient and the study. The consent form will ensure that all situations when a patient goes 
into limited ( long term ) follow- up (including disease progression or start of a new 
anticancer treatment)  are clearly explained . The p atient ’s right to fully withdraw from the 
study at any time, including from long term follow -up, is not compromised by this change.  
8. Clarification  of testing  requirement for human anti -murine antibodies ( HAMA ) detection 
at study entry, indicating that any commercially available test can be used  as part of 
inclusion criteria verification. Clear differentiation  between the HAMA test that is to be 
performed part of inclusion criter ia verification  and the test that is performed at screening

Confidential  Page  4 of 165 and over time during the study to monitor for the occurrence of HAMA directed to 
lilotomab (Section  4.5 and Section  9.6). 
9. Clarification of the different study periods, up to 3 months, from 6 to 12 months and 
thereafter with clear separation of what is required during follow -up until disease 
progression or start  of further cancer treatment (extensive follow -up involving hospital 
visits) versus after disease progression or further therapy  (limited follow -up which may be 
conducted by telephone) . The prior  structure and wording of this section was leading to 
misinte rpretation. Clearly highlighting what does not require hospital visits  is important in 
the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.  
10. Addition that Betalutin treatment may be administered  by any other specialist  physician 
authorised to administer  radioactive  treatments  per local  regulations (not just of a nuclear 
medicine specialist)  to reflect local regulations for the administration of 
radiopharmaceuticals ; Section  9.5. 
11. Additional biobanking facilities specified  to meet global requirements; Section  11.3. 
12. Clarification added that for Part B and C, an investigator assessment of tumour response 
will initially be made but tumour response determined by independent central review will 
be used as th e basis for patient decision making in relation to disease status  wherever 
possible ; Section  12. Throughout the protocol, it has further been clarifie d that patients 
should continue to undergo tumour assessments  until disease progression assessed by 
central review. This is to ensure the primary objective of ORR  and the  secondary objective 
of duration of response assessed by independent central review are not compromised  by 
early discontinuation of tumour assessments, where investigator and independent central 
review  assessments of response  differ .  
The p ossibility  has been kept for the investigator to make treatment decision based on 
investigator’s assessment, where the patient’s condition requires  immediate action at time 
of progression. 
13. Clarification to adverse event (AE) reporting requirements  and reporting of potential 
long- term toxicity; Section  13.2 and Section  13.4.8  to improve understanding  and 
reporting compliance. 
14. Modification in Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) grade 
allocation for laboratory results  and clarified that this will be derived as part of the 
statistical analysis  rather than allocated by the study site ; Section  13.4.5 . 
15. Revision of the statistical analysis section (i) to group  all details in a single place to 
facilitate readability of it and (ii) clarif y some require ments .  
• Statistical analysis methodology restructured and c larification added to explain that 
results from Part A ( Phase I and Phase IIa), Part B and Part C will be summarised 
separately due to differences in study design, dose regimens and patient populat ions. 
However analyses in specific populations and for specific dose regimens may be 
performed in the overall study population.  
• Efficacy endpoint definitions moved to the statistical section only, removing the 
duplicate definitions from Section  5.6 and removing Section 12.4 from protocol 
Version 14; Section  14.1.7 . There is no change in the definitions and no loss of 
information.

Version 1 5.1 
19 February  2021 
 
Confidential  Page  5 of 165 • Timing of analyses for Part B more clearly identified. Clarification added that the 
statistical analysis would be fully described in a Statistical Analysis Pla n (SAP) prior 
to database lock ; Section  14.1.5 . 
• “Not evaluable” added as an option for tumour response for completeness; 
Section  14.1.7 . 
• Requirement to present the primary endpoint at each timepoint removed as not 
necessary; Section  14.1.7 . 
• Handling tumour response data from patients who withdraw or are lost to follow -up 
as disease progression at the time of the last assessment removed; Section  14.1.12 . 
These data will be handled as censored data and relevant sensitivity analyses will be 
conducted.   
• Clarifications added to the definitions of the efficacy endpoints and of analysis of 
time-to event endpoints; Section  14.1.7 . 
16. Addition of a new section on collection of IMP dosing errors  previously omitted ; 
Section  16.3.6 . 
Further changes to improve sense, readability and prevent misunderstanding have also been 
made without changes to overall protocol requirements : 
17. Clarifications to the rationale for a lower dose of Betalutin for patients with prior 
autologous- SCT and/or lower platelet counts, including the consolidation of text previously 
in the study design section; Section  4.8.11 . There is n o change to the rationale  previously 
described in Version 14. 
18. Clear presentation of the design of each part of the study  and of the assessments to be 
performed. Where procedures differ between different parts of the study, these have been  
separated ; Section 6.1. 
19. Clear wording of the definition of dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) and the dose definition 
procedures in Part B subpopulations ; Section   6.2. 
20. Separation of the study procedures into study periods and parts of the study, where 
applicable  to aid understanding  (as the reading of this section generated multiple queries 
from investigators  and led to protocol deviations ); Section 9.6 . This includes separating the 
biodistribution and pharmacokinetics from the main procedures as they are only applicable 
to a subset of patients. 
21. Clarification that the biopsy collected at relapse and/or disease progression is subject to the 
patient’s willingness to have this biopsy; Section  11.1. 
22. Consolidation of key information relating to the Safety Review Committee (SRC) in one 
section and removal of unnecessary duplication; Section  16.4. 
Correct ion of  typographical errors, introduction of abbreviations  and formatting throughout the 
document. Section headings were simplified throughout the document so the  parts of the study 
each section is applicable to is now only stated when this is not Parts A, B and C. 
Changes made to the body text have been reflected in the synopsis.

Confidential  Page  10 of 165  Adult patients with relapsed FL who have received  ≥2 prior anti-neoplastic  or immunotherapy -based regimens , and 
are refractory  to any previous  anti-CD20 based regimen. Prior therapy mu st include an anti -CD20 therapy and an 
alkylating agent. Anti-CD20  refractory disease is defined as lack of a complete remission  (CR) or partial remission  
(PR), or PD within 6 months of last dose  of an anti-CD20 containing regimen . Prior exposure to idelalisib or other 
PI3K (Phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase) inhibitors is allowed.  The eligibility criteria were widened under protocol 
Version 14 to allow enrolment of patien ts with a prior autologous stem cell transplant (SCT) ( if at least two years 
have elapsed since transplantation ) and/or platelet count ≥100 ×109/L but <150 ×109/L at study entry.   
Part C (phase I Ia Pharmacokinetic Cohort):   
Adult patients with relapsed iNHL  who are willing and able to provide pharmacokinetic samples (samples for 
Betalutin total radioactivity and total lilotomab antibodies) .  
Investigational Products:  
Betalutin  is an antibody -radionuclide -conjugate (ARC) composed of the radioisotope lutetium -177 (177Lu), the 
linker p-SNC -benzyl -DOTA  (also referred as satetraxetan)  and the murine anti -human CD37 immunoglobulin G 1 
(IgG 1) antibody, lilotomab. The active moiety is the beta-particle  emitting nuclide 177Lu. Lutetium -177 has a 
physical half -life of 6.7 days. The antibody lilotomab recogni ses epitopes on the human CD37 antigen, which is 
abundant on the cell surface of tumour s of B-cell origin, including non-Hodgkin lymphoma ( NHL ). Betalutin is 
prepared as a solution for intravenous administration. The amount of Betalutin (also referred as lutetium 
(177Lu)-lilotomab satetraxetan ) injected per patient will depend on dose level and patient’s weight; however,  the 
dose is capped for patients who weigh more than 130 kg (patients heavier than 130 kg will receive the dose for a 
130 kg patient). The concentration of lilotomab satetraxetan in the Betalutin formulation is 0,78 mg/m L, and the  
amount injected is dependent on how many days after production the product is given, up to a maximum of 18 mg 
of lilotomab. Betalutin will be supplied in vials containing a ready -to-use solution.  
The investigational medicinal product (IMP) will be referred to as Betalutin or lutetium (177Lu)-lilotomab 
satetraxetan in the protocol.  
Rituximab , a chimeric anti -CD20 antibody, will be used to clear the circulating normal peripheral B -lymphocytes 
in the  blood and in the spleen before administ ering  Betalutin. This may secure better access for Betalutin to less 
accessible compartments such as lymph nodes and larger tumour  masses. Rituximab targets CD20 and will not 
block the binding of Betalutin  to CD37 on  the B -lymphocytes or tumour  cells.  
Pre-medication consisting of an antipyretic and antihistamine should be administered before infusion of rituximab. 
The types of pre -medication will be in accordance with each hospital’s routine, including any use of cor ticosteroids.

Lilotomab  is a murine anti -human CD37 antibody, and the same antibody, as used in Betalutin, that wil l be used 
to block the binding on remaining B -cells, in the lymphoid organs following the rituximab pre -treatment. 
Administration of lilotomab will be performed within 4 hours before administration of Betalutin on Day 0. Pre -
medication consisting of an antipyretic and antihistamine medication should be administered before infusion of 
lilotomab .  
Study Design:  
Part A: 
Phase I:  Open -label, non -randomi sed, single injection ascending dose study to assess safety, biodistribution and  
PK of Betalutin.  
A 3+3 dose -escalation design was used to determine  the MTD and /or Recommended phase 2 dose ( RP2D ) for 
Betalutin and the optimal pre -treatment and pre-dosing  regimen with rituximab and lilotomab for further phase II a 
evaluation . Dose -limiting  toxicity ( DLT ) criteria are defined in Section  6.2.1 . 
Phase II a: Two phase II a expansion cohorts were  added to Arms 1 and 4  for confirmatory safety and efficacy 
assessment . Thirty ( 30) patients were enrolled in the Arm 1 phase IIa cohort . Approximately 10 -15 patients will be 
enrolled  in the Arm 4 phase IIa cohort .   
Part B (FL phase IIb) -“PARADIGME ” 
Open label, randomis ed 1:1 (stratified for double -refractory patients , where double -refractory is defined as 
refractory to both an anti-CD20 therapy  and an alkylating agent therapy  – see Section 9.1 .7.2 for full definition ) to 
receive one of the 2 RP2Ds (40 mg lilotomab + 15 MB q/kg Betalutin (referred to as “40/15 ”) or 100 mg/m2 
lilotomab + 20  MBq/kg Betalutin (referred to as ”100/20 ”). The patients will receive a single dose of rituximab 
375 mg/m2 on Day -14, and then sequential administration of lilotomab followed by Betalutin within 4  hours on 
Day 0. . An interim analysis of efficacy and safety data was planned after approximately 50 patients (see ‘Statistical

single regimen of 40mg lilotomab and 15MBq/kg Betalutin (“40/15”) was selected for all subsequent patients 
having platelets ≥150×109/L (and without a prior autologous -SCT (see below) Patient enrolment will be completed 
when a total of 87 patients have received the “40/15”  regimen (including patients in the randomised section).  
The eligibility criteria for Part B were also widened (under protocol Version 14), to allow enrollment of patients 
with prior autologous -SCT (that occurred more than 2 years prior to enrolment in the study) and / or with platelet 
counts ≥100×109/L but <150×109/L at study entry. These patients will be divided into 3 sub populations . The dose 
of Bet alutin administered to the first 3 first patients treated each sub population  will be reduced:  
• Patients with a prior autologous -SCT and platelet  count  ≥150×109/L will receive Betalutin at the reduced dose of 12.5 
MBq/kg  
• Patients with a prior autologous -SCT and platelet  count  ≥100×109/L but <150×109/L will receive Betalutin at the 
reduced dose of 10 MBq/kg  
• Patients without a prior autologous -SCT and platelet count ≥ 100×109/L but  <150×109/L will receive Betalutin at the 
reduced dose of 12.5 MBq/kg   
All patients will be followed for 6 weeks. The SRC will review the safety data (in particular, the number of dose 
limiting toxicities [ DLTs ]) of each sub population  and recommend the current reduced dosing level be maintained,  
a dose escalation  (including escalation to Betalutin 15 MBq/kg with lilotomab 40 mg), an evaluation of an 
additional 3 patients, a dose -decrease , a different dose or to stop  the recruitment of further patients with a prior 
autologous -SCT and/or lower platelet count .

The patients will attend study centre visits during the screening, treatment and follow -up period.  
The treatment period  is defined from the time of rituximab pre-treatment until 12 weeks after administration of 
Betalutin.  Soft tissue imaging (chest/abdominal/pelvic computed tomography [ CT] and/or positron -emission 
tomography [ PET]/CT scan) and clinical evidence of disease progression will be measured. Pharmacokinetics, 
dosimetry and biodistribution will be assessed i n selected  patients in Part A Phase I. These assessments may also 
be performed for Part A phase II a and Part B  patients at selected sites that are experienced and equipped to perform 
these assessments; however,  they are not mandatory  for all patients . Pharmacokinetics is mandatory for all pat ients  
enrolled in Part C .  
The follow -up period  for Part A is defined from 12 weeks to  a maximum of  5 years after administration of Betalutin, 
or until further anticancer  therapy is given . During the follow -up period, serious adverse events ( SAE ) related to 
treatment, and AE s related to study medication , haematology , serum biochemistry, and long -term safety will be 
collected every 3 months after end of study treatment until 12 months after start of study treatment. Thereafter, at 
6 month interval s until the patient has been through their 5-year visit or until need of other cancer -related  treatment . 
At these visits,  soft tissue imaging and clinical evidence of disease progression will be assessed.  
Survival and long term safety data will be collected for all consenting patients up to a maximum of 5 years 
from the date that they were administered study drug .  
Part B and Part C - up to 5 years after Betalutin administration.  
Extensive follow -up (hospital visits) will take place for all patients every 3 months for the first year (Months 6, 9 
and 12). Tumour imaging assessments are only required until the patient  has further anticancer treatment after 
Betalutin administration or disease progression prior to further anticancer therapy  as assessed by central imaging 
review. All other scheduled assessments should be performed.  
After Month 12, follow -up will continue every 6 months up to 5  years  after the Betalutin dose . Extensive follow -up 
(hospital visits) must be performed until the patient has further anticancer treatment after Betalutin administration 
or disease progression prior to further anticancer therapy  as assessed by central imaging review. Thereafter, the 
patient will continue limited follow up every 6  months for potential long -term toxicity (new onset adverse events 
of special interest [AESIs], ADRs and study treatment -related SAEs), OS, further anticancer  treatment and ADA 
testing (only if ADA test is positive at Month 12; testing to be continued until a negative result is obtained).  Unless 
blood sampling is required for ADA testing, limited follow -up visits can be performed by telephone.

performed  to evaluate the possibility of study modifications or continuation of both regimens .   
The intent -to-treat (ITT) population will consist of all patients who were randomi sed to one of the dose groups. The 
primary efficacy endpoint is ORR .  Scans will be pe rformed at baseline, 3, 6, 9, 12, 18 and 24, 36, 48 and 60  months 
after Betalutin injection for all patients to assess tumour  response  as follows:  
• CR 
• PR 
• No change/stable disease (SD)  
• PD 
• NE 
Response rates will be presented as percentage of patients in the ITT p opulation  with the exact 95% confidence 
interval (Clopper -Pearson).  
Assessment of ORR  in the “40/15 ” treatment regimen .  
A total of 87 patients, including the ones in the interim analysis, will be recruited and t reated with the “40/15 ” 
regimen.  
The response rate under the null hypothesis is set at 30%, versus the response  rate of 48% under the alternativ e 
hypothesis will be compared. A 2 -sided exact test with a significance level of 0.05 will be used to compare th e 
observed response rate against the hypothesis. In addition, a complete response rate of 8% under the null hypothesis 
versus a complete respons e rate of 20% under t he alternative hypothesis will also be tested . 
Descriptive and summary statistics will be calculated for each pharmacokinetic parameter. Further analyses may 
be conducted, as appropriate.  Pharmacokinetic data and/or parameters from patients who received li lotomab 40  mg 
and Betalutin 15MBq/kg in Part B may be combined with data from Part C.   
Safety Review Committee:  
Part A:  
The recommendation to increase or decrease the dose in Part A has been made by the SRC based on the safety data 
in the database at the time until the last patient in the current cohort has onset of blood counts recovery. The SRC 
consists of 3 to 4 relevant  experts including the coordinating investigator for the study.  
Part B:  
The SRC will periodically monitor the safety data.  
In line with its Charter, the Safety Review Committee reviewed the results of the interim analysis and provided a 
recommendation to  the Sponsor to continue or terminate treatment arms or to perform other modifications. The 
recommendation was based on the totality of safety, efficacy, and other available data (e.g., immunogenicity data) 
based on the following guidelines:  
• If ORR ≥ 40% in each treatment regimen, the study may complete its targeted enrolment of up to 130 patients 
(around 65 per arm).  
• If ORR < 40% in either regimen then the regimen with ORR <40% may be terminated.  
• If both regimens have ORR <40%, the study may be terminate d for futility or modified. The regimen(s) with 
ORR ≥40% will proceed to enrol the remaining patients, up to 65 patients per regimen (including the patients 
in the interim analysis). The final decision lies with the Sponsor.  
To facilitate decision to keep or drop treatment arms based on ORR rates, the boundary of 40% ORR was 
non-binding and for guidance only. Following the interim analysis, the SRC recommended to discontinue the 
“100/20” treatment regimen and continue with further recruitment in the “4 0/15” treatment regimen.  
For patients included with prior autologous -SCT and/or with platelet counts ≥100 ×109/L but <150 ×109/L, the SRC 
will evaluate the emerging safety data (in particular, DLTs) from the first 3 patients in each of the 3 subpopulations

- to 15MBq/kg in the subpopulation with prior autologous -SCT and platelet  count  ≥150 ×109/L.  
- to 15MBq/kg in the subpopulation without a prior autologous -SCT, and platelet count ≥100 ×109/L but 
<150 ×109/L.  
• to 12.5MBq/kg in the subpopulation  with a prior autologous -SCT and platelet count ≥100×109/L but 
<150 ×109/L. If 1 DLT is observed  in a given sub population , a further 3 patients will be treated at the initial 
dose in this sub population  and the SRC will review the overall safety of the cohort prior to establishing the 
dose to be recommended .   
• If 2 DLTs are observed in a ny given  subpopulation , the SRC may consider a dose reduction to “40/10” for 
the 2 sub populations  treated with “40/12.5 ” or may decide to close enrolment in the sub population . There will 
be no dose reduction of Betalutin below 10 MBq /kg.   
The SRC will evaluate the safety data from each set of 3 patients (either 3 or 3+3) in each sub population and may 
request a subsequent review of safety data.  
Part C : 
The SRC will periodically monitor the safety data  in line with Part B review of safety data .

4.1 Background   
Non-Hodgkin Lymphomas (NHL) as a group comprise the most common malignant 
haematological disease. NHLs are a diverse group of blood cancers that include any kind of 
lymphoma except Hodgkin lymphoma. NHLs are tumours developed from lymphocytes, a type 
of wh ite blood cell s. NHL s vary in their clinical behaviour, morphologic appearance, 
immunologic and molecular phenotype. The various types represent neoplastic lymphoid cells 
arrested at different stages of differentiation. Based on their natural history, NHLs  can be 
clinically classified as indolent, aggressive, and highly aggressive. Diffuse large B -cell and 
follicular lymphoma (FL) are the most common subtypes. 
NHLs are the fifth most common cause of cancer in the United States, with an estimated 
incidence o f 70,130 cases in 2012. Follicular centr e cell lymphomas are the second most 
common subtype, comprising approximately 40% of all NHLs . Since 1950, the incidence of 
NHL has steadily increased at approximately 4% per year  (1).  
Treatment usually depends on the type of lymphoma and its stage, as well as other prognostic 
factors. The different treatment options are radiation therapy, chemotherapy, immunotherapy , 
radioimmunotherapy (RIT) and bone marrow or peripheral stem cell transplant ation . In B -cell 
and follicular lymphoma, rituximab (immunother apy) combined with chemotherapy or a 
combination of drugs such as CHOP (cyclophosphamide, hydroxydaunorubicin, oncovin and 
prednisone) regimen is used. Treatment options for p atients with relapsed indolent non-Hodgkin 
B-cell lymphoma (iNHL) are rituximab, chemotherapy combined with anti-cluster of 
differentiation ( CD)20 agents or other chemotherapy combinations, or 
phosphatidylinositol-3- kinase ( PI3K ) inhibitors, although the proportion responding  and 
duration of response (DoR) decreases with each relapse.  
The aim of RIT is to use a monoclonal antibody (MoAb) to target an isotope for radiation to 
tumour tissue while limiting the toxicity to normal cells. Beta -emitting radioimmunoconjugates 
(RIC) possess high levels of clinical activity in patients with rela psed or refractory B -cell 
lymphomas (2), including those refractory to rituximab (3, 4)  and chemother apy (5). Clinical 
data ha ve validated that RIT is both more cost effective and more efficacious than 
nonradioactive immunotherapy (6, 7). More recently, several single -arm studies have  
demonstrated that upfront RIT administered either alone or with chemotherapy to previously 
untreated iNHL patients produces overall response rates  (ORRs)  of 90 -100%, complete response 
(CR) rates of 60 -95% and durable remissions  (8-11). A phase III study of RIT as part of frontline 
therapy for iNHL reported that consolidation therapy with yttrium -90 (90Y)-ibritumomab 
tiuxetan  (Zevalin ®) after induction chemotherapy markedly prolonged progression- free survival 
(PFS) in patients with previously untrea ted stage II or IV FL (12). In another study, patients with 
indolent and aggressive NHL s received 4 cycles of chemotherapy followed by high 
myelo ablative dose 90Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan  followed by autologous stem cell support (13). 
After a follow -up time of 3 0 months, the overall survival (OS) rate was 87% and the event free 
survival was 69%. Although myeloablative doses of 90Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan were given, the 
RIT was well tolerated. The low dose -rate permits RIT to be effective for haematologic 
malignancies while causing minimal non -haematological toxicity.   
When anti -CD20 RIT is given to patients,  they are administered with large quantities of 
unlabelled  cold anti -CD20 antibody immediately befor e radiolabelled anti -CD20 antibodies. 
Such a priming dose is necessary to optimi se radiolabelled antibody concentrations in tumour

and permitting sufficient radiolabelled ant ibody to bypass these sites and penetrate less 
accessible compartments such as lymph nodes and large  tumour masses. However, too much 
cold an ti-CD20 antibody over a long time can result in blocking of the CD20 antigen on tumour 
cells and thus reduce the effect of anti -CD20 RIT. Both clinical and  non- clinical  studies have 
shown that in some circumstances quite low rituximab concentrations in the  blood can reduce 
tumour cell targeting and thus impair the clinical efficacy of CD20 -directed RIT (16). A solu tion 
to this problem might be to omit cold rituximab from the last  cycles of therapy before RIT. 
Alternatively; one could choose to target another B- cell surface antigen such as CD37.  
RIT with CD37 as the target  antigen  has been explored previously using a  Iodine-131 
(131I)-label led murine monoclonal antibody (MB-1) both in a mouse model and in patients with 
low, intermediate and high- risk NHL s (17-22). CD37 antibodies were compared with CD20 
antibodies and a higher grade of internali sation and degradation of 131I-labeled RIC was found 
for CD37 than for CD20 (22). Furthermore, a favourable biodistribution was obtained in 59% 
of the patients for CD20 and for 50% of the patients for CD37. The amount of cold priming with 
antibody necessary to get a favourable biodistribution was higher for CD37 than for CD20. All 
six patients treated with 131I-MB-1 (against CD37 antibody)  had a complete response and three  
of the patients received  bone marrow transplantation. Of twelve  patients that were treated with 
131I labelled  antibody against CD20 , ten had a complete response and eleven needed bone 
marrow transplantation (22).   Despite the clinical responses o bserved in this study, the data for 
CD20 was evaluated to be marginally better than for CD37. CD20 was therefore chosen as the 
target antigen for further development of a commercially available RIC. This development 
resulted in Food and Drug Administration  (FDA ) approval of Bexxar ® and Zevalin in 2003. No 
subsequent efforts have been made to target CD37 with RICs, although anti -CD37 agents 
(otlertuzumab and BI836 826 for chronic lymphocytic leukemia  and anti -CD37  antibody-drug 
conjugates IMGN529 and AGS67E for lymphoid malignancies) are currently in early clinical 
development (23). Previous studies thus show that CD37 is a potent target for both 
immunotherapy and RIT. 
The chloramine T method of 131I-labeling was used in the early studies of anti-CD37 RIT 
described above (22). 131I labelled  to antibodies with the iodogen or the chloramine T method 
are not being contained in the cells if the antigen -antibody complex is internali sed (24, 25) . 
Inside the cells the nuclide is removed from the antibody by intracellular enzymes and diffuse s 
out and away from the tumour cells (26). The same so -called dehalogenation has been shown 
with CD22 antibodies, which are also internalised (27). M etallic radionuclides labelled  to 
antibodies with so -called chelators are however more stable and remain contained inside the 
cells to a much higher de gree (28). B y using metallic radionuclides internali sing antigens can 
be used for tumour targeting and tumour uptake may also be higher than for non -internali sing 
antibodies as well . 
4.2 Lutetium (177Lu)- lilotomab Satetraxetan (Betalutin) and Lilotomab   
At the Norwegian Radium Hospital,  an anti -CD37 antibody ( lilotomab ) was developed in the 
1980s (29). Lilotomab and the anti -CD20 antibody rituximab have been labelled  with both 125I 
and indium-111 (111In) and measured cell bound activity after 4 days of incubation with a 
lymphoma cell line. The results show  that the problem of catabolism of RIC can be circumvented 
by labelling  with metallic nuclides such as 111In or lutetiu m-177 (177Lu) which  confirm s the result 
of Press et al. mentioned in Section  4.1 (23, 24).

Confidential  Page  30 of 165  The most common radiopharmaceuticals used in therapy today utili se substances that disintegrate 
resulting in the emission of a beta-particle . Beta-particle s are electrons emitted fro m the nucleus 
of an atom. Beta emitters approved for therapy include 131I (half-life ( T½) = 8 days), 90Y 
(T½ = 2.7 days), and 177Lu (T ½ = 6.7 days). 177Lu has been selected  for use in Betalutin  since it 
has proven to be suitable for labelling  of the antibody and has an appropriate energy of the emitted 
β-particle ( maximum energy ( Emax) = 0.497 Me V, T ½ = 6.7 days). Furthermore, it has a low 
abundance of photons with almost ideal energy for imagin g (E = 113 keV, abundance = 6.5%; 
E = 208 keV, abundance = 11%).  
Betalutin ( lilotomab  labelled  with 177Lu via the chelator p -SCN -benzyl- DOTA ), is the product to 
be tested in this clinical study. Betalutin has been developed by Nordic Nanovector in 
collaboration with the Norwegian Radium Hospital for the treatment of relapsed NHL .  
RIT permits delivery of a therapeutic dose of radiation directly to the deoxyribonucleic acid 
(DNA ) of tumour cells. The radionuclide 177Lu is a beta -particle emitter. The beta particle s are 
electrons with energy and range in tissue suitable for treating NHLs . The absorbed radiation 
results in DNA damage and tumour cell  death . The radiation emitted from the radiolabelled  
antibody affects not only the antibody -binding cell, but also neighbouring cells. This mechanism 
of action of RIT may be especially beneficial in treating patients with bulky or poorly 
vasculari sed tumour s. 
Betalutin has been tested for targeting, therapeutic and toxic effect in cells and in mice. Lilotomab 
has similar or better binding properties to CD37 as rituximab has to CD20. Therapy against single 
cells showed a significantly better effect of Betalut in than of 177Lu-rituximab. The maximum 
tolerated dose ( MTD ) of Betalutin in severe combined immune deficient ( SCID ) mice with 
tumour cells in the bone marrow was between 50 and 100 MBq/kg , and 530 MBq/kg in nude 
mice ( 55). Biodistribution studies with Betalutin have shown high uptake in tumour and uptake 
in normal organs similar to the uptake of 177Lu-rituximab . The preclinical  data to date indicate 
that Betalutin  has a suitable biodistribution profile with high uptake in tumour cells, and that the 
efficacy results  in the mouse models show promise of potentially interesting clinical results.  
Relevant animal spec ies that shares a cross -reactive or identical target antigen as humans have 
not been found. The antibody lilotoma b did not elicit a response by human immune effectors in 
vitro . No significant antibody -dependent effect of lilotomab  was observed by complement 
activation or immune cell cytotoxicity. The human tissues cross -reactivity studies showed that 
the morphology and distribution of cells stained with lilotomab  were consistent with that of 
B-cells.  
The antibody part of Betalutin, lilotomab  is administered  as pre-treatment  within 4 hours before 
Betalutin administration  in A rm 1, Arm 4 and Arm 5. The few CD37 antigen positive cells that 
are left after rituximab treatment can then be blocked by infusion of lilotomab , within 4 hours 
before Betalutin. It is assumed that lilotomab  will bind to the most easily accessible CD37 
positive cells in the lym phoid organs. The binding capacity in tumo ur seems more difficult to 
saturate  (21), pre-treatment with lilotomab  should increase the possibility that Betalutin bind s 
to the tumour cells.  Clinical da ta with  the radiolabe lled murine anti-CD37  MB-1 antibody 
indica tes that 10 mg/kg can be g iven without s aturati ng tu mour uptake in patients with non-lysed 
B-cells (21). Xenograft studies in nude mice indicate that 1  mg/kg lilotomab  does not 
saturate tumour uptake of Betalutin.

investigated  using a traditional 3+3 study design . Patients were enrolled into one of 4 a rms to 
identify the MTD /recommended phase II dose (RP2D)  of Betalutin . An additional arm (Arm  5) 
was added to further characteri se the pharmacokinetic profile of Betalutin.  
4.2.2 Part A – Phase IIa  
Phase II of Part A expanded the number of patients added to Arms 1 and 4 to confirm safety and 
further evaluate the efficacy  of the RP2Ds 40 mg lilotomab/15 MBq/kg Betalutin and 100 mg/m2 
lilotomab/20  MBq/kg Betalutin respectively in additional patients  (see Section  6.1 for patient 
disposition). 
4.2.3 Part B – FL Phase IIb  
Following a review of the clinical safety, efficacy, dosimetry , and pharmacokinetic data from 
the treatment regimens used in Part A, the 2 candidate  RP2D dosing regimens from Arms  1 and 
4 emerged as contenders for the selection  of the RP2D for future clinical development . 
Therefore, a phase  IIb randomi sed sub-study ( hereafter referred to as Part B, or 
“PARADIGME” ) was added to further delineate the risk : benefit profile of these candidate  
RP2D treatment regimens in a population of FL patients with ≥2 prior lines of therapy who are 
refractory to rituximab/anti -CD20 therapy.  
Following an interim analysis of 47 patients with FL, randomised to either 40  mg lilotomab and 
15MBq/kg Betalutin  (“40/15”) , or 100mg/m2 lilotomab  and 20MBq /kg Betalutin  (“100/20”), 
the Safety Review Committee ( SRC ) recommended that the “40/15” dose be selected for 
subsequent patients entered to Part B (which was formali sed in Version 14 of the protocol ). 
Version 14 of the protocol also allowed for a relaxation of 2 selection criteria i.e. minimum 
accepted level of p latelets at study entry and restriction on prior autologous stem cell 
transplantation  (SCT)  (note: the Betalutin dose will be lower  for patients entered with a prior 
autologous SCT and/or platelets <150 ×109/L - see Section 4.2.4 ).  
4.2.4 Part B – Inclusion of Patients with a Prior Auto-SCT  and Inclusion of Patients 
with Lower Platelet Threshold  
Patients with a prior auto logous- SCT, for whom at least two years have elapsed  since 
transplantation before the date of consent can be entered to Part B .  
Patients with a platelet count ≥100×109/L but <150 ×109/L can be entered to Part B.  
Patients with both a prior auto logous- SCT and /or a platelet count ≥100 ×109/L but <150 ×109/L 
can be entered to Part B.  The Betalutin dose is to be adapted for these patients. 
Patients will be divided into  in 3 sub populations and the first 3 patients in each will receive the 
following doses: 
• Patients with a prior auto logous- SCT and platelet count ≥150 ×109/L will be followed for 
at least 6 weeks. These patients will receive Betalutin at the reduced dose of 12.5  MBq/kg  
with lilotomab 40  mg.   
• Patients with a prior auto logous- SCT and platelet count ≥100 ×109/L but <150 ×109/L will 
be followed for at least 6 weeks. These patients will receive Betalutin at the reduced dose 
of 10 MBq/kg with lilotomab 40  mg.

Emerging safety data (in particular, dose limiting toxicities [ DLT ]) from the first 3 patients in 
each sub population will be reviewed by the S RC. 
The SRC may request a subsequent review of safety data (see Section  16.4). The SRC can 
recommend the current reduced dosing level be maintained, a dose escalation (including 
escalation to Betalutin 15 MBq/kg with lilotomab 40  mg), an evaluation of an additional 3 
patients, a dose -decrease, a different dose or to stop the recruitment of further patients with a 
prior autologous-SCT and/or lower platelet count.  
4.2.5  Part C  - Inclusion of a Cohort D edicated to Pharmacokinetic  Assessments  
Although pharmacokinetic assessment is an exploratory objective in Parts A and B, 
measurement of total lilotomab antibodies was not included in Part A. Part C has therefore been 
introduced to further measure total lilotomab antibodies and to assess the total radioactivity of 
Betalutin in the  blood to inform future development activities. Part C will be performed at 
selected sites that are able to perform blood sampling under the restrictions necessary due to the 
Coronavirus Disease 19 ( COVID -19) pandemic. Adult patients with relapsed indolent non -
Hodgkin B -cell lymphoma (iNHL) (according to the broader Part A entry criteria ) who are 
willing and able to provide pharmacokinetic samples will be enrolled to improve recruitment to 
this part of the study. 
All patients treated in Part C will be treated with the  selected RP2D  (“40/15” dose regimen).  
4.3 Rituximab  or Anti-CD20 Antibody Therapy   
Rituximab/anti -CD20 agent  is used as a standard treatment for patients with B-cell NHL either 
as monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy.  The description of rituximab can be 
found in the prescribing information and package insert if not otherwise referred to.  
Rituximab binds specifically to the trans membrane  antigen, CD20, a non -glycosylated 
phosphoprotein, located on pr e-B and mature B-lymphocyte s. The antigen is expressed on >95% 
of all B -cell NHL . 
For patients with B -cell NHL , a dose of 375 mg/m2 is administered once weekly. As 
monotherapy, weekly doses and 4 cycles are standard. In combination with chemotherapy 3  to 
8 cycles with 2 to 4 weeks interval is most commonly used.  
Figure 6-1  shows the  study design and  pre-treatment regimens of rituximab (375 mg/m2), to 
clear circulating normal peripheral B -lymphocytes in the blood  and spleen  to optimi se the 
biodistribution of Betalutin. Rituximab is shown in several studies to have substantial effect of 
depleting normal circulating B -cells. It is likely that the dead B -cells in the circulation are 
filtered through the spleen, bone marrow and liver. Afte r rituximab treatment, many of these 
cells may be retained in the spleen over a certain period before they are eliminated , however 
literature is limited. The concentration of normal B -cells is higher in the spleen than in the blood, 
and the depletion of B- cells in the spleen is expected to take a longer time than for blood.   
For a description of the scientific rationale for the use of rituximab on Day 0 see Section 4.8.4.2  
and see rationale for dose selection , Section  4.8.3 . For a summary of risks associated with 
rituximab, please see Section  4.4.

Intravenous administration of Betalutin is an experimental treatment for patients with NHL. The 
following benefit– risk assessment  is anticipated . 
Disease and patient population 
Indolent B -cell (low -risk group) NHL is not curable with standard treatment app roaches, 
perhaps with the exception of curative potential for stage I/II indolent lymphomas using 
radiotherapy. Conventional first line therapy  is commonly associated with a high rate of clinical 
response, which is followed by disease relapse. Subsequent remissions may occur in association 
with standard care; however, such remissions tend to occur at progressively lower rates and with 
shorter remission durations across patients.  
Patients included in Part s A and C  of this study are adults with histologicall y confirmed 
relapsed iNHL of any of the following subtypes; a) follicular grade I -IIIA, b) marginal zone, 
c) small lymphocytic, d) lymphoplasmacytic, or e) mantle cell, considered to have experienced 
treatment failures from prior treatment regimens, includ ing chemotherapy and immunotherapy 
treatment regimens.  
Patients included in Part B  of this study are adult patients with a diagnosis of histologically 
confirmed relapsed rituximab/anti -CD20 refractory B -cell FL (follicular grade I -IIIa) who have 
received at least 2 prior chemotherapy or immunotherapy -based regimens, including alkylating 
agents. Prior exposure to idelalisib or other PI3K inhibitors is also allowed. 
Following a protocol amendment (Protocol Version 7), the inclusion criterion for testing for 
CD37 positive cells was removed in order to remove the delay in treating patients while the  
biopsy testing was completed. This amendment was supported by Dahle et al. showing that 
CD37 was expressed in 216  out of 217 tumour biopsies from patients with B -cell lymphoma 
(37) and suggestion that the one case with no CD37  expression (a patient with ch ronic 
lymphocyte leukaemia) may have been due to technical reasons associated with the assay.  All 
pre-treatment biopsies that were available for testing in the Part A of the LYMRIT -37-01 study 
(65/74 patients) stained positive for CD37. 
Non-clinical risk a ssessment of Betalutin  
There are no directly -relevant animal models available to evaluate fully the non -clinical safety 
of Betalutin - as there are no animals with cross -reactivity to the lilotomab antibody. Safety has 
been evaluated by use of the most rel evant studies to determine tolerability and target organ 
toxicity namely, combined toxicity and therapy studies in immune -compromised mice. There 
are no therapies in current use which target the lilotomab antibody so there are no additional 
data from which  potential risks may be identified. 
Betalutin is a β -emitting antibody -radionuclide- conjugate designed specifically for the treatment 
of NHL . The radionuclide 177Lu was chosen since it allows effective irradiation of single cells 
as well as micro -metastase s and larger tumours. The antibody lilotomab  was chosen for its 
excellent properties in binding to the CD37 antigen. The radionuclide, antibody and chelator 
used for radiolabelling are prepared in compliance with Good Manufacturing Practice 
regulations.  
From cell cytotoxicity assays in vitro , and antitumour studies in vivo,  effective antitumour 
activity of Betalutin has been demonstrated at dose levels that were well tolerated in the sensitive 
SCID mouse model. 
The pharmacological rationale of lutetium (177Lu)-lilotomab satetraxetan  is considered

the investigational medicinal product (IMP). The expression of CD37 in human NHL has been 
demonstrated, thereby identifying this receptor as a target for treatment of NHL. The binding 
properties of lilotomab  to lymphoma cells in vitro  and in vivo  have been evaluated and the 
cytotoxic activity of the IMP has been evaluated in animal models of NHL. The selection of the 
177Lu metallic radionuclide is considered opti mal, as the half -life of the isotope is 6.7 days, 
consistent with the rate of localisation of Betalutin to the CD37 antigen. After binding of 
Betalutin to the CD37 -antigen, the antibody -antigen complex may be internalised to some 
degree. The antibody lilotomab  has not been shown to elicit a response by human immune 
effectors in vitro and no antibody -dependent effect of lilotomab  has been observed by 
complement activation or immune cell cytotoxicity, indicating that the mechanism of 
cytotoxicity of the IMP Betalutin is due to the radiation effect mediated by delivery of 177Lu to 
the site of action.  
Even though there is a lack of pharmacologically -relevant animal models for the evaluation of 
Betalutin mechanism of action or safety studies there is a considerable clinical experience with 
CD37 targeted antibodies, 177Lu radiolabelled agents and the DOTA chelator. Human 
experience is considered more relevant to the development of Betalutin and can provide 
significant insight into the anticipated clinical response.  177Lu-labelled rituximab, prepared using 
the same DOTA procedure as for Betalutin, has recently been administered clinically (30, 31) . 
The maximum tolerated dose was 50 mCi/m2 (approximately 48 MBq/kg body weight)  and 
efficacy results in NHL patients were promising. This report confirms that the radiolabelling 
procedure for Betalutin is compatible with human administration and provides  supportive 
evidence of the safety of both satetraxetan and 177Lu. 
It is anticipated that benefits of administration of the IMP will include a targeted antitumour 
response, evidenced by improvements in progression -free survival and OS. Furthermore, the 
targeted binding of lilotomab  to CD37 expressed on lymphoma cells is anticipated to increase 
delivery of 177Lu to the desired site of action, thus minimising general systemic toxicity typically 
associated with external radiation therapy. 
Risk with rituximab pre -treatment  
The most frequently observed adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in patients receiving MabThera® 
are infusion -related reactions which occur in the majority of patients during the first infusion. 
The incidence of infusion -relate d symptoms decreases substantially with subsequent infusions 
and is less than 1% after 8 doses of MabThera. Infectious events (predominantly bacterial and 
viral) occurred in approximately 30 -55% of patients during clinical studies in patients with NHL. 
ADR s reported  as very common (≥1/10) are infections (bacterial and viral), reduction in 
haematological parameters, infusion -related reactions such as angioedema, nausea, pruritus, 
rash, alopecia, fever, chills, asthenia, headache, and decreased immunoglobulin  G (IgG) levels. 
Please refer to the prescribing information for further details. 
Risk with lilotomab pre -dosing  
In order to improve the biodistribution of Betalutin the patients will receive an infusion of 40  mg, 
60 mg/m2 or 100 mg/m2 (up to a maximum of 270 mg) of lilotomab within 4 hours before 
administration of Betalutin. The infusion rate will be 100 mL/hour. The same procedure as used 
with rituximab will be used for lilotomab. If the patient experiences adverse events (AEs) such 
as a drop in blood pressure, chills, fever, or dyspnoea the infusion will be stopped. When the 
symptoms disappear, the infusion will start again with 50% reduced infusion rate.  
The patients will benefit from an improved biodistribution of Betalutin, which will decrease the

which could facilitate better tumour uptake of the radioimmunoconjugate as suggested from 
development studies with CD37 targeting with 131I-MB-1 (21).  
Risk with omit ting lilotomab as pre -dosing  
In Part A, phase I Arm 1, the first patient enrolled received 10 MBq/kg Betalutin without 
lilotomab  pre-dosing. The patient did not experience a DLT  and stayed in remission for 
approximately 4 years. 
In Arm 2, patients did not receive lilotomab pre-dosing . Two patients enrolled into Arm 2 who 
received 15 MBq/kg of Betalutin experienced haematological DLTs (grade 4 
thrombocytopenia/neutropenia enrolment), and 1 patient received a de -escalated dose of 
Betalutin 10  MBq/kg. The arm was discontinued as omitting pre -treatment with lilotomab  had 
a negative impact on the safety of Betalutin.  
In Arm 3, patients received a pre -dose with rituximab instead of lilotomab on Day 0 (see  
Section  4.8.4.2  for the rationale). Three (3) patients were dosed with Betalutin 15 MBq/kg. 
Arm 3 was subsequently discontinued as rituximab pre -dosing appeared to have an inferior 
safety profile compared to both 40 mg and 100 mg/m2 lilotomab.  
4.5 Immunogenicity Risk Assessment of Lilotomab and Betalutin   
Pre-existing and/or development of a human anti-murine antibody ( HAMA ) response has  been 
described to influence the effectiveness of immunotherapy using murine or chimeric monoclonal 
antibodies ( 44). In addition, allergic reaction s could occur, stressing the importance of assessing 
pre-existing HAMA as one of the patient inclusion criteria in clinical studies for murine 
therapeutic monoclonal antibodies ( 43). In Part A phase I  and phase IIa and P art B (FL phase  IIb) 
and Part  C (Pharmacokinetic C ohort phase IIa) , patients will therefore be tested for pre -existing 
HAMA, with a positive HAMA test being considered as an exclusion criteri on (see Section  7.1.1  
and Section  7.2.1  respectively). In addition, all patients will be monitored for  the d evelopment 
of an anti-drug antibody ( ADA ) response after injection of lilotomab and Betalutin.  
In Part A, monitoring of the immune response post -treatment was performed at Day 7 (phase I 
only), month 1, 3, 6 and 12 after Betalutin administration, using ei ther the Milenia® Quickline 
HAMA test on -site and/or at a central laboratory using an immuno-fluorometric bridging assay 
(IFMA) for human antibodies specific to lilotomab (ADA test). The development of an immune 
response after administration of lilotomab and 177Lu-lilotomab satetraxetan was reported for 7 
out of 74 subjects overall. Five of the observed responses were detected one month after 
treatment, three had resolved at the 3 -mont h visit and one at the 6 -month visit (data not available 
for one patient). Two additional immune responses were detected at 12-month follow-up visits. 
No reported side -effects could be associated with the development of an immune response .

In Part B  and Part C , screening  for pre -existing HAMA will be performed using a commercially 
available test  prior to inclusion (such as  the Milenia® Quickline HAMA kit or a HAMA -ELISA 
test commercially available) .  
An exploratory HAMA test to assess HAMA specificity vs. lilotomab (IFMA test) will also be 
performed at baseline  for rese arch purposes. The IFMA test result may be used to verify a 
negativ e HAMA test at baseline in cases, where HAMA testing using a commercially available 
test is not feasible.  
A tiered approach using a bridging enzyme -linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) format will be 
used to monitor the development of an ADA response 
(https://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/Guidances/UCM192750.pdf ). Conjugation of 
satetraxetan to lilotomab before fu rther chelation with 177Lu to obtain Betalutin  occurs randomly 
via one of the 92 lysine present in lilotomab sequence ( 45) As all promiscuous neo -epitopes 
identified for lilotomab are predicted to contain one or more lysine, one could speculate, taking 
into account the described in vitro  stability of the conjugation b etween lilotomab and 
satetraxetan, that one or more of these neo -epitopes could be masked for Betalutin. To ensure the 
maximum sensitivity e.g. detection of all potential ADA, lilotomab and not  Betalutin will be used 
in the in vitro  bridging assay. This strategy will be implemented in Part  B. 
4.6 Alternative Treatments versus Betalutin Treatment   
Alternative treatments for the patient population to be included in this study are rather limited 
and would be restricted to continuation of chemotherapy either alone, or in combination with 
rituximab /an anti -CD20 agent  administration , or PI3K inhibitors. The major disadvantages with 
chemotherapeutic approaches to treatment are the AEs and discomfort exper ienced by patients, 
including but not limited to: a) h aematological toxicities, b) nausea, c) malaise, d)  infections, 
and e) alopecia. It is considered highly likely that, in most cases, patients will remain on medical 
leave during the treatment period which may extend from 6 to 8 weeks. 
An additional alternative treatment to Betalutin therapy may be the use of the 
radioimmunoconjugate Zevalin. This therapeutic agent has demonstrated acceptable efficacy 
with respect to NHL treatment, with the advantage of f ewer AEs presenting relative to 
conventional chemotherapy. Importantly, Zevalin targets the same antigen CD20 as the antibody 
rituximab, as compared to Betalutin, which  target the antigen CD37 on B -cells; consequently, 
Betalutin provides potential advantag es from a dual -targeting approach, which  would not be 
afforded by Zevalin.

Confidential  Page  37 of 165  Betalutin administration is expected to result in less patient discomfort as compared to standard 
treatments involving chemotherapy and rituximab. Betalutin therapy will be administ ered as a 
single treatment event – fundamentally as an outpatient procedure; the patient s will not require 
hospitalis ation following treatment  (unless local laws stipulate otherwise) . Following 
administration of Betalutin,  it is anticipated that significant impacts on patient lifestyle will not 
be experienced; for example, patients may continue working if the disease in itself does not 
preclude them from doing so. The overall patient’s quality of life (QoL) following 
administration of rituximab, lilotomab  and Betalutin treatment is realistically and reasonably 
anticipated to be improved in comparison to treatment regimens involving chemotherapy in 
conjunction with rituximab. 
In this clinical phase I/II study there will be a higher clinical burden for the patients enrolled on 
study with respect to frequency of hospital visits, blood sampling and imaging procedures tha n 
would otherwise be experienced by patients not participating in the clinical trial. Though the 
follow- on burden to treatment may be greater for  study participants, patients who are enrolled 
on study will receive more thorough monitoring. 
4.7 Clinical Risk -benefit Summary   
The main objective in the first part of this study (Part A) was to define an appropriate dos ing 
regimen  for further phase II evaluation. Two candidates have emerged for comparison based on 
available efficacy, safety and dosimetry data. The RP2D of Betalutin  for Arm 1 (lilotomab 
40 mg pre-dose) was 15 MBq/kg; 30 patients were enrolled in the phase IIa arm, and follow-up 
is ongoing. For Arm 4 (lilotomab 100 mg/m2 pre-dose), the RP2D of Betalutin was 20 MBq/kg. 
A phase II a expansion cohort has completed enrolment . 
To summari se the safety profile, neutropenia and thrombocytopenia were the most commonly 
reported grade 3/4 AEs, and were generally transient in nature with recovery to grade 1 by 3 
months in the majority of patients. The mean platelet and neutrophil nadirs occurred at Day 40 
(range Day 34 to Day 43) for platelets  and Day 49 (range Day 43 to Day 56) for neutrophils 
after Betalutin administration. There were no reports of febrile neutropenia. The preliminary 
safety profile of both Arms 1 and 4 is promising, with the higher lilotomab pre -dose having a 
favourable impact on the degree of neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. The number of patients 
receiving platelet transfusions in Arms 1 and 4 was balanced. Two Arm 1 patients required 
prophylactic platelet transfusions for grade 4 thrombocytopenia, and 1 Arm 4 patient received a 
platelet transfusion for haematuri a/grade 3 thrombocytopenia. Lilotomab pre -dosing mitigates 
hematologic toxicity; 2/3 patients in Arm 2 without lilotomab pre -dosing had h aematologic 
DLTs. Preliminary efficacy data show ORR s of 64% for all enrolled patients (CR 28%) ( 53). 
Taken together, t he risk: benefit  profile of Betalutin is favo urable .  
Potential risk factors of Betalutin and proposed risk minimi sation activities  are presented in 
Table 4 -2. The dose- escalation  design and definition of DLTs  are described in Section 6.2.

4.8 Rationale and Dose  Selection   
4.8.1 Estimation of Start Dose of Betalutin  with Pre-dosing of Lilotomab 
As described in Section 4.2, preclinical studies performed with SCID mice showed that the 
Betalutin MTD was between 50 and 100 MBq/kg body weight ( b.w), and 530 MBq/kg in nude 
mice. SCID mice lack B -cells and T -cells and are often used as a model organism since they 
easily accept growth of human tumour xenografts and cells. However, because of the SCID 
mutation , SCID mice are not able to repair DNA damage. This type of mouse is therefore very 
sensitive to ionising radiati on. As a result, the MTD in SCID mice may not be representative for 
the patients that are to b e included in this study.  
DOTA -conjugated rituximab has been lab elled with 177Lu using the same labelling procedure as 
for Betalutin, and tested in clinical studies (30, 31). MTD was 50 mCi/m2 (approximately 
48 MBq/kg b.w.). The starting dose of 20 mCi/m2 (approximately 19 MBq/kg b.w.) was well 
tolerated and no grade 3/4 non- haematological toxicity or anaemia was observed.  
Phase I data from treatment of NHL indicate similar dose tolerability for 131I radiolabelled 
anti-CD20 and anti -CD37 antibodies, in studies where trace labelled pre -dosing were used to 
estim ate acceptable whole -body radiation dose for each patient (21, 32) . It is assumed that a 
similar relationship  between 177Lu radiolabelled versions o f rituximab (chimeric anti -CD20 
antibody) and lilotomab (murine anti -CD37 antibody) may exist. It was therefore expected that 
the MTD for lutetium (177Lu)-lilotomab satetraxetan may approximate that of 
177Lu-DOTA -rituximab, i.e. 48  MBq/kg b.w. The amount o f pre -dose with cold antibody was 
250 mg/m2 for 177Lu-rituximab, so the MTD for Betalutin with 40 mg or 100 mg/m2 predosing 
was expected to be lower. 
The recommended doses, absorbed radiation dose per decay and half -lives for Bexxar and 
Zevalin are known, and it is possible to estimate a range for the MTD for Betalutin based on the 
MTDs for Bexxar and Zevalin. To make the estimate it is assumed that the pharmacokinetics in 
blood and bone marrow are similar for the three compounds, under these assumptions th e MTD 
for Betalutin was predicted to be in the range of 52 to 72 MB/kg b.w. With the cold antibody 
pre-dosing of 250 mg/m2 for Zevalin and 450 mg for Bexxar compared to lilotomab 40 mg and 
100 mg/m2 (i.e. 10 and 2.5 fold lower), it was expected that the Betalutin MTD would be lower.

19 February  2021 
 
Confidential  Page  40 of 165  In summary, a starting dose of 10 MBq/kg for Betalutin was predicted to be well tolerated, based 
on the above mentioned clinical studies with 177Lu-DOTA -rituximab, Zevalin and Bexxar.  
4.8.2 Justification of Cold A ntibody (Lilotomab ) Dose in Betalutin  
The goal of this study is the investigation of radiation -induced toxicity and associated 
anti-tumour activity of Betalutin  via stepwise escalation of the amount of radioactivity, with and 
without pre-dosing with the cold antibody lilotomab .   
In the phase I arms , the administered amount of radioactivity was increased with increasing 
doses of Betalutin. This was obtained by radiolabelling each vial of antibody conjugate 
(lilotomab satetraxetan) with increasing amounts of 177Lu-, while the amount of lilotomab  
satetraxetan  remained  at a fixed level of 7.8 mg per vial. For Betalutin  doses above the maximum 
allowable radioactive concentration,  2 vials of  Betalutin would be administered. The amount of 
lilotomab  satetraxetan  that w ould be administered (on a per patient basis) var ied over a range 
5.5-7.8 mg [single vial of Betalutin] and 11.0-15.6 mg [2 vials of Betalutin] , as the injected 
volume of Betalutin is dependent on the time from manufacturing to the actual injection due to 
the decay of 177Lu.  
Preclinical data supportive of the  proposed dosing levels were generated using Betalutin with a  
specific activity level between 100 and 400 MBq/mg. From a practical standpoint, the upper 
limit of  177Lu that can be conjugated to 7 .8 mg of lilotomab  satetraxetan  is equivalent to a patient 
dose of 40 MBq/kg. This limit is based on the fact that there are approximately 2 satetraxetan 
molecules  per antibody, which thereby limits the total amount of 177Lu atoms that can be 
conjugated to a fixed number of lilotomab  satetraxetan  molecules. In addition, specific activity 
levels substantially greater than 400 MBq/mg would be anticipated to increase the radiolysis of 
the therapeutic product and could possibly reduce overall product integrity.   
In addition, experimentation performed to assess tumour targeting, relative to the concentration 
of administered antibody, was performed using murine xenograft tumour models. Preclinical  
data from nude mice implanted with Daudi tumours has demonstrated that varying antibody 
doses over the range 0.01 to 1 mg/kg  does not impact overall biodistribution of the administered 
radioimmunoconjugate. Consequently, and on the basis of these preclinical  findings, a relevant 
antibody dose range of 0.01 to 1 mg/kg was recommended for consideration. 
As administered levels of antibody are directly relevant to potential clinical therapeutic benefit, 
it is worth noting that CD37 antigen expression is of a similar pattern to that of CD20 antigen. 
It is therefore appropriate to compare the antibody dosage identified for Betalutin 
(7 - 20 mg/patient) with the antibody dose levels used for both Zevalin (3.2 mg/patient) and 
Bexxar (35 mg/patient) treatment. Both Zevalin and Bexxar have demonstrated significant and 
clinically meaningful results in association with treatment administered  at the indicated antibody 
dose levels. Consequently, it is reasonable to anticipate that an antibody dose of 7-20 mg/patient, 
in the case of Betalutin administration, is reflective of a relevant clinical antibody dose.  
4.8.3 Justification  of Pre-treatment  with  Rituximab and Selection of Dose 
All patients received pre -treatment with rituximab to clear circulating peripheral B -lymphocytes 
from the blood and spleen in order to optimise the biodistribution of Betalutin. It was envisaged 
that, as a consequence of peripheral B -lymphocyte clearance, the radiolabelled antibodies would 
bind to remaining CD37 antigens in tumour masses. Importantly, as rituximab targets CD20, 
this treatment was not considered likely to block the binding of Betalutin CD37 expressed on 
either B lymphocytes or tumour cells, which has subsequently been confirmed in preclinical

Rituximab is used as a standard treatment for patients with B -cell NHL either  as monotherapy , 
or in combination with chemotherapy , at a dose of 375 mg/m2 on a weekly basis. The 
conventional monotherapy approach utilises four cycles of weekly administration of rituximab. 
In contrast, combination therapy utili ses weekly dosing for 3 to 8 cycles with administration of 
rituximab commonly occurring at 2 to 4 -week intervals. In the setting of B -cell NHL, rituximab 
treatment has been shown to deplete tumour cells via antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity (30% 
depletion) and by apoptotic mechanisms (30% relative  cytotoxicity) within as little as 3 h ours 
following treatment (33). 
It was initially considered that injecting 3 75 mg/m2 of rituximab on Days 28 and 21  prior to 
Betalutin was necessary to ensure clearance of B -cells from the lymphoid organs  (Arms 1  and 
2). This was subsequently modified to a single rituximab pre -treatment dose on Day 14 (Arms 
3, 4, and 5), due to the reported rapid onset of action of rituximab for B -cell depletion ( within 
24 to 72 hours; continuing  for at least 2 -3 months) (39) , and to shorten the time to Betalutin  
administration from enrolment for these patients with advanced  disease.  Dosimetry data from 
phase I patients subsequently ind icated that pre -dosing with lilotomab was potentially even more 
important than rituximab for the biodistribution of Betalutin. For a summary of the rituximab 
pre-treatment regimens per arm, please refer to  Table 6 -1. 
4.8.4 Justification of Pre-Dosing with Lilotomab and Selection of Dose for Part A  
4.8.4.1  Rationale for P re-dosing: Arm 1 
In our development of radioimmunotherapy against CD37 antigen positive lymphoma, we did 
not have the option of using an epitope analogue antibody to lyse cells as a pre-treatment , 
because the antibody does not cause significant cell lysis. Rituximab ca uses cell lysis, and is 
thus another reason for using rituximab in the study. The cell lysis properties of lilotomab  were 
evaluated using in vitro  assays of complement dependent cytotoxicity and antibody-dependent 
cellular toxicity.  
The few CD37 antigen positive cells that are left  following B -cell depletion with  rituximab 
pre-treatment can then be blocked by infusion of lilotomab  within 4 hours before Betalutin. It 
was assumed that lilotomab  would bind to the most easily accessible CD37 positive cells in the 
lymphoid organs and thus facilitating  Betalutin binding to the tumou r cells.  
Our in vitro  data indicate d that an effective blocking of the CD37 antigen could be obtained with 
1-5 µg/mL of lilotomab  (equivalent to 1 -5 mg/ L blood) with as little  as 1-hour pre- treatment . 
Unlabelled  lilotomab  was given  within 4 hours before Betalutin to obtain sufficient blocking. A 
modest pre-dose of 40 mg* lilotomab  was used in A rm 1 for the blocking, equivalent to 10 mg/ L 
of blood, assuming a patient blood volume of 5 L. This concentration was anticipated to  result 
in blocking of 95  - 97% of the CD37 positive cells based on the in vitro  blocking data. In 
conclusion, a lilotomab pre-dose of 40 mg was thus se lected for Arm 1.  
* Termed as 50 mg previously due to use of incorrect extinction coefficient (see amendment  5, 
protocol Version 8 ). 
4.8.4.2  Rationale for P re-dosing: Arms 2 and 3 
In Arm 2 , no pre -dosing with lilotomab  was used. It was demonstrated that pre -dosing with a 
cold antibody was necessary due to increased h aematologic toxicity without it ; Arm 2 was 
subsequently discontinued due to  haematologic  DLT . Dosimetry data from patients in Arm 2 
compared with patients in Arms 1 and 4 (with lilotomab pre -dosing) showed increased  red

toxicity observed. 
Arm 3 was added  to examine  the use of rituximab as a Day 0 pre-dosing regimen  (within 4 hours 
prior to Betalutin administration) instead of l ilotomab . The scientific rationale for the 
administration of rituximab as pre -dosing on Day 0 was unrelated to the clearing of peripheral 
B-lymphocytes from the blood and spleen. Betalutin contains a murine monoclonal antibody 
which has been shown from in vitro  analysis to bind to the human Fc-gamma -Receptor IIa 
(FcγRIIa), which is expressed on most leukocytes including neutrophils, eosinophils, 
B-lymphocytes, platelets, mast cells, Langerhans cell and dendritic cells among other cell types. 
The binding of  Betalutin to the  FcγRIIa will alter its biodistribution , potentially resulting in a 
decrease in the circulating half -life of Betalutin. While rituximab binds to CD20 it also binds to 
the FcγRIIa and will therefore likely  inhibit the binding of Betalutin to this receptor. If observed 
in vivo  this inhibition of Betalutin binding would therefore improve the biodistribution of 
Betalutin without inhibiting its affinity for CD37 in the patient ’s tumour  cells. This improved 
biodistribution may reduce the incidenc e of mye losuppressive AEs by decreasing the 
radioactivity in the bone marrow and spleen. In addition, preclinical  data from immune deficient 
xenograft mice with implanted human lymphoma tumour cells show an increased duration of 
survival for animals admini stered a combination of rituximab and Betalutin, compared with 
animals administered either antibody alone.  
As a result of the potential to both improve the efficacy of Betalutin and reduce  the incidence of 
myelosuppressi on, Arm 3 was added  to examine the effect of rituximab administered on Day 0 
on the safety -efficacy profile of Betalutin.  As compared with Arm 2, there was a small 
improvement in the platelet/neutrophil nadirs, while the absorbed radiation dose to the red 
marrow was the same. Arm3 was subse quently closed as the clinical profile was inferior to use 
of lilotomab pre-dosing. 
4.8.4.3  Rationale for P re-dosing: Arm 4 
In Arm 4, the lilotomab pre -dosing was increased to 100 mg/m2. Using the same radioisotope as 
Betalutin, Forrer et al 2010 conducted a phase I/II dose -escalation trial of 177Lu-labelled 
rituximab in follicular and mantle cell lymphoma patients (38). Using a Day 0 dose of unlabelled 
rituximab of 250 mg/m2 (~475 mg total dose) patients were able to receive up to 1850 MBq/m2 
of radioactivity isotope equivalent to approximately 45 MBq/kg. By linear extrapolation of the 
observed MTD of 15 MBq with 40 mg of lilotomab from Arm 1 compared to the results of 
Forrer et al, increa sing the dose of unlabelled antibody to approximately 100 mg/m2 was 
considered to allow an MTD of approximately 25 MBq/kg of Betalutin. In addition, increasing 
the dose of lilotomab may further improve the biodistribution of the labelled antibody allowing 
a greater concentration of radioactivity to be targeted to the tumour and away from the patient’s 
bone marrow.  
In addition, as an in vitro  analysis of the binding of both lilotomab and Betalutin to the Fc γRIIa 
(that 40 mg of lilotomab may not be sufficient to block binding to CD37 positive cells in the 
spleen, bone marrow and any remaining circulating lymphocytes, as well as block binding to the 
FcγRIIa, increasing the lilotomab pre -dose may improve the biodistribution of Betalutin 
allowing a greater conce ntration of radioactivity to be targeted to the tum our and away from the 
patient’s bone marrow.  
Furthermore, as previously described, the cold antibody pre -dosing used for Zevalin is 
250 mg/m2, more than 10 -fold higher than the lilotomab pre -dose used in Arm 1 (40 mg). It was 
considered that this magnitude of increase for a lilotomab pre -dose (i.e. from 40 mg to

Confidential  Page  43 of 165  250 mg/m2) was too large, while an increase to 100 mg/m2 would be large enough to give a 
measurable effect. As blood volume depends on the size of  the patient, and as Betalutin blood 
concentration is considered important for its uptake into tumours, pre -dosing was evaluated on 
a body surface area (BSA) adjusted dose rather than a fixed dose. 
In conclusion, a lilotomab pre -dose of 100 mg/m2 was thus explored in Arm 4 (up to a maximum 
of 2.7 m2). The RP2D of Betalutin in Arm 4 was determined to be 20 MBq/kg. The rationale for 
dosing per m2 is to explore both a fixed pre-dose (in Arm 1) and a BSA adjusted dose.  
4.8.4.4  Rationale for Arm 5  
The dose of 60 mg/m2 of lilotomab for A rm 5 has been selected to be intermediate between the 
lilotomab dose in Arm 1 (40  mg) and Arm 4 (100  mg/m2), and is also being tested in a n ongoing 
study of Betalutin in diffuse large B -cell lymphoma ( DLBCL ) patients (LYMRIT 37 -05). If the 
dose of lilotomab used in Arm 4 is excessive the cold antibody may inhibit the  uptake of 
Betalutin , thus  decreasing efficacy. Therefore , Arm 5 was modified to test a lower dose of 
lilotomab which may provide equivalent protection to the cells of the spleen and bone marrow 
without inhibiting radioactivity uptake in the tumour . Testing this dose will also provide an 
additional assessment point in the dose effect curve of lilotomab pre -dosing with patients having 
then been tested at 0  mg, 40 mg , 60 mg/m2, and 100  mg/m2 in 4 different treatment arms.  Up to 
6 patients will receive rituximab on Day -14 (375  mg/m2) and lilotomab (60  mg/m2) followed by 
Betalutin 20 MBq/kg on Day 0.  
4.8.5 Rationale for the Selection  of Patients with Follicular Lymphoma in Part B  
(FL phase IIb)   
Data presented at the American society of hematology annual conference in 2018 showed that 
patients across all arms of the phase 1 study experienced encouraging efficacy alongside a 
carefully managed safety profile that was deemed to be fa vourable (60).

4.8.6 Rationale for Part C and Selection of Patients with Indolent NHL in Part C   
Initial pharmacokinetics data were collected in Part A in a broad population of iNHL . Collecti on 
of further pharmacokinetics  data was included  in Part B to better characterise the 
pharmacokinetics of Betalutin and total lilotomab antibodies. Pharmacokinetic sampling in Part 
B is to be performed at selected centres and only for patients consenting for pharmacokinetic 
sample collectio n. Pharmacokinetic sample collection is not feasible at all sites participating in 
study 37 -01 and ability to perform adequate sample collection is currently further limited due to 
restrictions related to COVID -19.  
As of January 2021, no Part B patient  has consented to  pharmacokinetic sample collection , 
which may have been partly due to patients’ reluctance to attend additional hospital visits during 
the COVID -19 pandemic.  
Part C is added to specifically assess the pharmacokinetics of Betalutin and total lilotomab 
antibodies and is to be conducted at selected centre s able and willing to perform adequate 
pharmacokinetic sample collection . In order to recruit enough patients in Part C, the population 
has been aligned with the population of Part A population , which is broader than Part B  
population and should allow for a sufficient amount of patients to be included at each 
participating site. Preliminary results from Part A have shown responses to study treatment in 
all populations of iNHL included in Part A (53), which allows their further inclusion in Part C.  
4.8.7 Rationale for D ose Selection(s) in P arts B and C  
4.8.7.1  Part B (FL  phase II )  
Following a review of the clinical safety, efficacy, dosimetry and Betalutin pharmacokinetics 
(total radioactivity in blood ) from Arms 1 through 4 in Part A  of this  study, 2 dosing regimens 
emerged as candidates for the RP2D : from Arm 1, a pre -dose of 40  mg lilotomab followed by 
15 MBq/kg Betalutin (“40/15”), and from Arm 4, a pre -dose of 100 mg/m2 lilotomab followed 
by 20 MBq/kg Betalutin (“100/20”).  
Arm 2 exceeded the pre -defined acceptable DLT of 20% ; and Arm 3 was closed after the 
enrolment of 3 patients due to an inferior  clinical profile  compared to Arm 1  and Arm 5 was 
closed  after Betalutin pharmacokinetics was evaluated .  
For Arm 1, 6 patients received 15 MBq/kg Betalutin in phase I; 1 patient developed grade 4 
neutropenia and thrombocytopenia for 9 and 12 days respectively. A second patient developed 
grade 3 thrombocytopenia for 22 days. It was at this time that the SRC  recommend ed: i) to revise 
the original DLT criteria  so that “grade 3 h aematologic toxicity that does not reco ver after 
2 weeks” was removed , since  grade 3 neutropenia and  thrombocytopenia are common toxicities

as the Betalutin dose for the Arm 1 phase II a expansion cohort. Thirty (30) patients were 
subsequently enrolled into the phase IIa cohort, and follow -up is ongoing. In total, 36 patients 
have received this regimen (25 with FL); the ORR is 64% (CR 25%), and for the FL subset, the 
ORR is 72% (CR 28%). The most common toxicities are reversible neutropenia and 
thrombocytopenia ( 4 patients with grade 4 neutropenia >7 days, and 4 with grade 4 
thrombocytopenia >7 days). There were no incidences of febrile neutropenia. 
For Arm 4, (lilotomab pre -dose of 100 mg/m2), 3 patients received Betalutin 15 MBq/kg. One 
patient had recovered their neutrophil count to grade 1 (1.5) by 8 weeks, but it was then 1.4 at 
12 weeks, after the SRC had made the decision to allow dose escalation to  20 MBq/kg. This 
case was reviewed by the SRC and enrolment continued at 20 MBq/kg. Seven patients received 
20 MBq/kg of Betalutin. One patient was under -dosed with lilotomab (approximately 60 mg/m2) 
and an additional patient was enrolled. One patient receiving 20 MBq/kg had a DLT of 
haematuria  (grade 3)  with thrombocytopenia (platelet count of 40 x 109/L) and r eceived a 
platelet transfusion.  The higher lilotomab pre -dose in Arm 4  has a favourable effect on the 
degree of neutropenia and thrombocytopenia ( Table 4 -5).  
The number of patients receiving platelet tra nsfusions in Arms 1 and 4 was balanced; 2  patients 
in Arm 1 received prophylactic platelet transfusions for grade 4  thrombocytopenia, and 1  patient 
in Arm 4 received a platelet transfusion for haematuria /grade 3 thrombocytopenia.  The SRC 
recommended to continue 20 MBq/kg as the Betalutin dose for the phase II a expansion cohort, 
which is  currently enrolling up to 15  patients.  Of 8 patients  enrolled, 7 were FL. The ORR is 
50% for all 8 patients and 57% for the FL subset. Two FL patient s have had a CR.

Following commencement of Part B, an interim analysis of the emerging safety and efficacy 
data from the first 47 patients was assessed by the SRC  who recommended that a ll patients 
enrolled after the interim analysis receive  the “40/15” dosing regimen. The Sponsor followed 
the SRC recommendation and the study protocol was amended ( Version  14) to continue with 
this single dose regimen  only.  
Protocol Version 14 also introduced changes in eligibility criteria allowing for patients with 
prior autologous -SCT ≥2 years prior to study enrolment and/or platelet count ≥100×109/L but 
<150×109/L to enter the study. The Betalutin dose is to be adapted for these patients.  Patients 
will be divided into in 3  subpopulations and the first 3 patients in each will receive the following 
doses: 
• Patients with a prior autologous -SCT and platelet  count ≥150×109/L will receive 
Betalutin at the reduced dose of 12.5 MBq/kg with lilotomab 40 mg.

Betalutin at the reduced dose of 12.5 MBq/kg with lilotomab 40 mg.  
The SRC wil l review the first 3 patients in each of these sub populations and evaluate the number 
of DLTs  observed . The SRC may recommend the current reduced dosing level be maintained, a 
dose escalation (including escalation to Betalutin 15 MBq/kg with lilotomab 40 mg), an 
evaluation of an additional 3 patients, a dose -decrease, a different dose or to stop the recruitment 
of further patients with a prior autologous-SCT and/or lower platelet count.  
4.8.7.2  Part C (Pharmacokinetic Cohort)  
Part C will start  enrolment after the interim analysis and decision on the selected RP2D for future 
development in P art B. Therefore, all patients enrolled to P art C will receive lilotomab 40  mg 
followed by Betalutin 15 MBq/kg.  
Note: Patients with a prior autologous -SCT  and/or platelet count ≥100×109/L but 
<150×109/L are excluded from Part  C. 
4.8.7.3  Pharmacokinetics (Part A)  
Betalutin pharmacokinetic s, measured as total  radioactivity in blood for patients in Arms  1, 2 
and 4 are presented in  Table 4 -6. The pharmacokinetic profile of Betalutin is shown to be 
affected by the pre -dosing with lilotomab at the 3 doses tested (0, 40 mg and 100  mg/m2), with 
lilotomab increasing the activity adjusted area under the total radioactivity in blood - time curve 
(AUC ), and reducing the volume of distribution and rate of clearance of Betalutin, while having 
little effect on activity -adjusted maximum total  radioactivity in blood measurement (C max).

4.8.7.4  Dosimetry  (Part A)  
Dosimetry data show that the spleen, bone marrow, liver and kidneys were the organs receiving 
the highest absorbed radiation dose ( Table 4 -7). For the absorbed radiation doses to the liver a nd 
kidneys, the observed exposure with Betalutin is well below the external beam radiation therapy 
tolerance levels ( 52). Analysis of the absorbed radiation dose (dosimetry) for Arms 1, 2 , and 4 
support that both the 40 mg and the 100 mg/m2 lilotomab pre -doses of Arms 1 and 4 protect the 
bone marrow as compared with no pre -dosing in Arm 2, since the absorbed radiation doses to 
red marrow are low er for Arm s 1 and 4 than for Arm 2  (50, 51 ). This correlates with the reduced

radiation dose to the red marrow for all patients in Arms 1 and 4 is below the previously 
published radiological tolerance limit  of 3 Gy (Table 4 -8). The absorbed  radiation dose is higher 
in Arm 4 compared to the other Arms; more patients are required to determine if this correlates 
with improved efficacy.

Confidential  Page  48 of 165  2 dosing regimens “40/15” and “100/20” for  randomis ed comparison in Part B  for dose 
selection . The preliminary results stated above indicate that the lilotomab/Betalutin regimen is 
highly active in patients with relapsed i NHL, particularly in patients with FL.  
4.8.8 Estimation of Interval  between Dose Escalations (Part A)  
In preclinical studies with SCID mice administration of 100 MBq/kg b.w. of Betalutin was 
associated with transient reductions in while blood cell  and platelet counts, nadir at 3 weeks 
after injection and recovered after 7 weeks. In the phase I clinical stu dy with 177Lu-rituximab 
the blood count nadirs were reached 7 to 8 weeks  post- injection. The time to  nadir may depend 
on the nature of the antibody. Rituximab is a chimeric antibody and is expected to be in the 
blood circulation longer than a murine antibo dy, such  as lilotomab . However, for Zevalin  (a 
murine RIC)  nadir levels  in humans were  reported to be 7 to 9 weeks after administration. 
Escalation to the next dose level of Betalutin has therefore been  scheduled to occur after a 
12-week follow- up period after the last patient has been included in the dose group or when 
blood counts have recovered with neutrophils ≥1.5×109/L and platelets ≥100×109/L, provided 
that the other safety criteria are met .  
4.8.9 Administration of Betalutin in the same Cohort (Part A)  
There will be no  time interval between patient dosing  in the same cohort. 
4.8.10  Outcome of the Interim Analysis on P atients Entered to Part B  
The SRC  reviewed efficacy and safety data for 47 patients who had been observed for a 
minimum of 3 months after Betalutin treatment. Based on the outcomes assessed  and the totality 
of safety and efficacy , including the ORR and overall safety data including haemat ological 
adverse events, the SRC recommend ed that all future patients receive the regimen of lilotomab 
40 mg and Betalutin 15  MBq/kg (“40/15”) . The re will be  Betalutin dose adjustments for the first 
patients with a prior autologous -SCT and/or platelet coun t ≥100 ×109/L but < 150×109/L as 
follows: 
• Patients with a prior auto logous SCT and platelet count ≥150 ×109/L will receive Betalutin 
at the reduced dose of 12.5 MBq/kg.   
• Patients with a prior auto logous SCT and platelet count ≥100×109/L but <150 ×109/L will 
receive Betalutin at the reduced dose of 10 MBq/kg. 
• Patients without a prior  autologous SCT, and platelet count ≥100×109/L but <150×109/L 
will receive Betalutin at the reduced dose of 12.5 MBq/kg.  
The SRC will review the safety data of the first 3 patients in each sub population and will further 
guide the determination of the recommended dose regimen for these subpopulations.    
4.8.11  Rationale for L ower Betalutin Dose for Patients with Prior Autologous- SCT  
and/or L ower Platelet Level (Part B)  
Discussion w ith the SRC , investigators and lymphoma experts (amendment implemented in 
protocol Version 14) lead to recommendation that:  
• The revised inclusion criteria for platelets  should not allow for the acceptable platelet

Confidential  Page  49 of 165  Elderly patients who have cycled through previous therap ies for FL and could potentially 
be treated on this protocol somet imes have platelets that are lower than would be 
considered ‘normal’ in younger, healthier reference populations. In order that this protocol 
includes a more representative population of FL patients there is a desire to include patients 
with platelets that  are ≥100 ×109/L. This threshold represents a compromise between the 
desire to be more inclusive and the potential threat from radiation induced 
thrombocytopenia which is a recognised and reproducible AE with this therapy . 
• There was a  desire for inclusion o f patients previously treated with autologous- SCT. The 
prevalence of this approach as the mainstay of first line therapy in some countries was 
considered. This was offset against the observation that patients with transplanted stem 
cells typically demonstrate more limited bone marrow reserves (6 1). One of the main 
effects of Betalutin administration, largely because of the attached radioactive lutetium is 
to compromised bone marrow. To retain sufficient activity to kill cancerous lymphoid 
tissue whilst avoiding excessive bone marrow toxicity a lower dose of Betalutin was 
suggested for initial assessment  in this population. 
The choice of the lilotomab  40 mg and  Betalutin 15 MBg/kg dose regimen at the interim analysis 
points to a generally more efficacious  and a more easily adhered to  regime n with acceptable 
safety profile . The supposition based on interim data is that the lower  dose of cold lilotomab (in 
the “40/15” regimen as compared to the “100/20” regimen) provides sufficient  shielding of bone 
marrow  without compromising the efficacy on tumour cells. The combination of a reduced dose 
of radioactivity for stem cell transplant patients and  the choice of a regime n that is generally 
looking to be gentler on the bone marrow was considered an adequate compromise.  
A further step to assess patients progress after the first 3 patients in each of the sub populations 
of prior autologous -SCT, lower platelet and both prior auto -SCT and lower platelets, who  have 
been on study for at least 6 weeks adds an extra element of supervision in considering the 
suitability of this new inclusion criterion. The consideration that future patients might be 
precluded from therapy by having previously received a mainstay ap proach like stem cell 
transplantation owing to the hitherto lack of experience dosing such patients and the desire to 
treat a representative population of NHL patients also factored into the rationale for  the 
amendment  introduced in protocol Version 14.

6 STUDY DESIGN  
6.1 Description of Study Design  
This study is a phase I/II, open -label study of Betalutin in patients with relapsed NHL  
(Figure 6-1 ).  
Part  A of the study uses a traditional 3+3 study design for dose- escalation . Cohorts of 3  - 6 
patients were enrolled into one of 4 arms  evaluating different pre -dosing regimens (no pre -dose, 
rituximab or lilotomab 40 mg or 100 mg/m2); dose escalation of Betalutin in each cohort 
continued until identification of a MTD or RP2D.  All patients receive d pre -treatment with 
rituximab. Dose -escalation decisions were guided by a SRC (see Section 6.2). Additional 
patients  (3 - 6) are being  enrolled in Arm 5 to more fully characteri se the PK profile  of Betalutin  
(60 mg/m2 lilotomab  plus 20 MBq/kg Betalutin).

Patients were then enrolled into 2 phase II a expansion arms at the RP2D of Arm 1 (40 mg 
lilotomab + 15 MBq/kg Betalutin) and Arm 4 (100 mg/m2 lilotomab + 20 MBq/kg Betalutin) to 
more fully evaluate safety and efficacy of the respective dosing regimen. Thirty (30) patients 
were enrolled into the Arm 1 phase IIa expansion arm . To further confirm  the safety  in phase I, 
the DLT rate was re -evaluated after a total of 15 patients had  been treated at the  RP2D of 
15 MBq/kg Betalutin plus 40 mg lilotomab , and enrolment proceeded.  
Part B  
In Part B  of the study, up to 130 patients with relapsed, rituximab/anti -CD20 refractory FL and 
platelet count ≥150 ×109/L who have received ≥2 prior lines of therapy were initially randomised 
in a 1:1  ratio to compare the  2 candidate RP2Ds of Arms 1 and 4 (40 mg lilotomab + 15 MBq/kg 
Betalutin v ersus 100 mg/m2 lilotomab + 20 MBq/kg Betalutin) (65 per treatment regimen) until 
the selection of one of the 2 regimens for further assessment in clinical development. 
 An interim analysis of efficacy and safety data was planned after approximately 50 patients (see 
Section  14.1.2.2 ). This was performed after the first 47 patient and the  SRC recommended that 
the “40/15” regimen be selected for further development. Randomisation was therefore stopped.   
Patient enrolment wi ll be completed when a total of 87 patients have received the “40/15” 
regimen selected for further development (including patients in the randomised section). 
The eligibility criteria for Part B, were also widened (under protocol Version 14), to allow 
enrollment of patients with prior auto -SCT ( that occurred more than 2 years  prior to enrolment 
in the study ) and/or with platelet counts ≥100 ×109/L but <150 ×109/L at study entry (see 
Section  4.8.5 ). The Betalutin dose is to be adapted for these patients. 
Patients will be divided into in 3 subpopulations and the first 3 patients in each will receive  the 
following doses: 
• Patients with a prior autologous -SCT and platelet count ≥150 ×109/L will receive 
Betalutin at the reduced dose of 12.5 MBq/kg with lilotomab 40 mg. 
• Patients with a prior autologous -SCT and platelet count ≥100×109/L but <150×109/L will 
receive Betalutin at the reduced dose of 10 MBq/kg with lilotomab 40 mg. 
• Patients without a prior autologous SCT with a platelet count ≥100×109/L but 
<150×109/L) will receive Betalutin at the reduced dose of 12.5 MBq/kg with lilotomab 
40 mg.  
The SRC will review the  emerging safety data (in particular, DLTs) from the first 3 pa tients in

Confidential  Page  57 of 165  Definition of study periods : 
The study treatment period  is defined as from the first administration of rituximab 
pre-treatment until 12 weeks after Betalutin administration . All patient s will be closely 
monitored during the study treatment period.  
The follow-up period  is  
Part A - up to 5 years or until the first anticancer  treatment after Betalutin administration . 
Survival and potential long -term toxicity information will continue to be collected up to 
5 years , even after further anticancer  treatment has begun . All patient s will be followed 
closely the first year after treatment, thereafter  every 6 months  (See Section 6-3 Sche dule of 
Assessment s).  
Part B  and Part C  - up to 5 years after Betalutin administration.  
Extensive f ollow-up (hospital visits) will take place for all  patients every 3 months for the 
first year (Months 6, 9 and 12). Tumour imaging assessments are only required until the 
patient has further anticancer treatment after Betalutin administration or disease progression 
prior to further anticancer therapy  as assessed by central imaging review. All other scheduled 
assessments should be performed. 
After  Month 12, follow- up will continue every  6 months up to 5 years  after the Betalutin  dose. 
Extensive follow-up (hospital visits ) must be performed  until the patient  has further  anticancer  
treatment  after Betalutin  administration  or disease  progression prior  to furth er anticancer  
therapy  as assessed  by central  imaging  review.  Thereafter,  the patient  will continue limited  
follow up every  6 months for potential long- term toxicity  (new  onset adverse  events  of special  
interest  [AESIs],  ADRs  and study treatment -related  SAE s), OS, further  anticancer  treatment  
and ADA  testing  (only if ADA  test is positive at Month 12; testing  to be continued until a 
negative result  is obtained). Unless  blood sampling  is required  for ADA  testing,  limited  
follow-up vi sits can be performed  by telephone.  
In Part B, Positron- emission tomography ( PET)/computed tomography ( CT) scans will be 
obtained for evaluation of tumour responses at certain intervals, see Section  6-3. Whole-body 
gamma camera and SPECT images will be taken  for patients  from Germany  and in other 
agreed sites , at various time points.  
In Part A, phase II a, serial gamma camera scans, Single Photon Emission Computed 
Tomography ( SPECT ) imaging and pharmacokinetics measurements to evaluate dosimetry 
and biodistribution are optional and will only be performed at sites that are experienced and 
equipped to perform these assessments. If the study site does not intend to conduct dosimetry 
assessments, onl y SPECT/CT images at Day 4 will be conducted as an optional assessment . 
6.2 Dose Escalation in Part A / Dose Definition in Special Populations  
in Part B  
6.2.1 Dose -limiting Toxicity Definition  
Both dose escalation decisions in Part A and dose definition decisions in  Part B were made 
based on the incidence of DLTs. A DLT is defined as:  
• Haematological:  
- Grade 4 toxicity that does not recover to grade 3 within 7 days

• Non-haematological:  
- Grade 3 or more, final  decision to be made by the SRC. 
Toxicity is graded according to CTCAE Version 4.0 or later, as applicable 
The DLT criteria were re -visited by the SRC in May 2017, and a recommendation was made 
to re -define “failure of platelets or neutrophils to recover to grade 1 by 12 weeks 
post- Betalutin” as not being a DLT event, as this is not associated with adverse clinical 
outcomes, is not a widely recognised h aematologic DLT parameter in chemotherapy or RIT 
studies, and is not aligned with the DLT criteri a from other Betalutin studies.  
6.2.2 Dose Escalation in Part A

Arm 1:  The recommended Betalutin dose following 40 mg lilotomab pre -dosing for 
phase IIa was 15 MBq/kg; a phase IIa expansion cohort enrolled 30 patients. 
Arm 2:   was discontinued after treatment of 3 patients (2 at 15 MBq/kg and 1 at 10  MBq/kg) 
due to dose- limiting h aematologic toxicity.  
Arm 3:   was discontinued after treatment of 3 patients at 15 MBq/kg due to a sub -optimal 
clinical profile.  
Arm 4:   Following review of available safety data from 3 patients treated at the starting dose 
of 15 MBq/kg the SRC endorsed enrolment of patients at 20 MBq/kg in phase I. 
Seven (7) patients were enrolled and the RP2D of Betalutin was determined to be 
20 MBq/kg. A phase IIa expansion cohort was subsequently opened. 
Arm 5 :  Additional patients (3 - 6) were enrolled in Arm 5 to more fully characterise the 
pharmacokintic profile of Betalutin (60 mg/m2 lilotomab plus 20 MBq/kg Betalutin).  
6.2.3 Dose Definition in Special Populations in Part B  
The dose escalation in each subpopulation of patients with prior autologous SCT and/or 
platelet count ≥100 ×109/L but <150 ×109/L in Part B (see Section  6.1) will follow the modified 
“3 + 3 ” design scheme shown in Table 6-4.

Outcome  Action  
 
0 DLT out of 3 patients  Escalate dose for next 3 patients  in the sub population : 
• to 15MBq/kg in the sub population  with prior autologous -SCT

and platelet count ≥100 ×109/L but <150×109/L.  
1 DLT out of 3 patients  Expand this dose level with 3 more patients  in the sub population . 
The SRC will review the overall safety of the cohort (6 patients) prior 
to establishing the dose to be recommended. Dose escalation may still 
be considered (same as for no DLT)  
2 DLT s in a sub population  The SRC may consider a dose reduction to “40/10” for the 
2 subpopulation s treated with “40/12.5” or may decide to close 
enrolment in the sub population . There will be no dose reduction of 
Betalutin below 10  MBq /kg.   
 
All patients will be followed for 6 weeks. The SRC will review the safety data from each set 
of 3 patients (either 3 or 3+3) (in particular, the number of DLTs) of each subpopulation and 
recommend the current reduced dosing level be maintained, a dose escalation (including 
escalation to Betalutin 15 MBq/kg with lilotomab 40 mg), an evaluation of an additional 3 
patients, a dose-decrease, a different dose or to stop the recruitment of further patients with a 
prior autologous-SCT and/or lower platelet count.

Where this is not possible, any deviations should be clearly documented. Any results of 
assessments performed remotely must be entered into the eCRF.  
Part A (phase I and phase IIa) : 
A visit window of ± 2 days is permitted for the Day 0 visit (the dose of radioactivity will be 
based on the actual administration date). Weekly assessments should occur within a window 
of ± 2 days. Visits occurring at 3 week intervals will have a window of  ± 3 days. During the 
treatment and follow -up periods, a window of ± 2 weeks for visits is acceptable. For PET/CT 
and CT evaluation a window of ± 2 weeks is acceptable for treatment and follow-up periods.  
The investigator may perform more frequent examinations than shown in  Table  6-5 and 
Table  6-7 if clinically needed. Data from such additional examinations are also to be recorded 
in the electronic Care Report Form (eCRF).  
All safety samples/assessments at baseline are to be obtained before dosing. Blood samples 
for haematology must be taken, analysed  and evaluated within 24 hours. 
Part B FL phase II b and P art C (P harmacokinetic  Cohort) :  
Screening assessments should be performed within 4 weeks prior to administration of 
rituximab. In case of unforeseen delays in the planned rituximab administration, including but 
not limited to delay in the availability of Betalutin, or delay in HAMA testing or results 
availability, the screening period may be extended upon Sponsor’s approval and the validity 
of imaging tests and bone marrow biopsy may be extended accordingly. 
A visit window of ± 2 days is permitted for the Day 0 visit  (the dose of radioactivity will be 
based on the actual administration date) . Weekly assessments should occur within a window 
of ± 2 days. Visits occurring at 3 week intervals will have a window of ±  3 days. During the 
treatment and follow- up period s, a window of ± 7 days  for visits is acceptable. For PET/CT 
and CT evaluation a window of ± 7 days is acceptable for treatment and follow -up periods.   
The investigator may perform more frequent examination s than shown in  Table  6-8 if 
clinically needed. Data from such additional examination s are also to be recorded in the eCRF.  
All safety samples/assessments at baseline are to be obtained before dosing. Blood sample s 
for haematology must be taken, analysed  and evaluated within 24 hours prior to Betalutin  
administration.

8 WITHDRAWL AND TERMINATION CRITERIA  
8.1 Patient Withdrawal   
In accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, each patient is free to withdraw from the study 
at any time. Investigator(s) also have the right to withdraw patients from the study in the event 
of illness, AEs, or other reasons concerning the health or wel l-being of the patient, or in the 
case of lack of cooperation. 
Single patient withdrawal is per definition:  
• when the patient is withdrawn during the treatment period or  extensive follow- up 
without consent to be followed up for survival, collection of long -term toxicities and 
anticancer therapies.  
• when the patient has died. 
If a patient dies , the immediate cause of death should be noted, in addition to death caused by 
underlying disease, the Investigator’s judgement on possible relationship to study drug sho uld 
be recorded in the CRF.  
If a patient starts  further anticancer t reatment , details of the new anticancer therapy regimen 
should be noted and recorded in the CRF.  
Should a patient decid e to withdraw after administration of the IMP( s), or should the 
investigator (s) decide to withdraw the patient, all efforts will be made to complete and report 
the observations up to the time of withdrawal as thoroughly as possible. A complete final 
evaluation at the time of the patient’s withdrawal should be made and an explanation given of 
why the patient is withdrawing or being withdrawn from the study. The reason and date for 
withdrawal must be noted in the eCRF. If the reason for withdrawal is a clinical AE or an 
abnormal laboratory test result, monitoring will continue until the outcome is evident. The 
specific event or test result(s) must be recorded in the eCRF.  
It is advisable to monitor the h aematology parameters of the withdrawn patients after Betalutin 
administration  until recovery to Grade 1 NCI CTCAE .  
Survival information , potential long- term  toxicity  information and further anticancer 
therapy will continue to be collected on withdrawn patients  unless the patient specifically 
withdraws their consent . Confirmation of continued consent to survival or coll ection of

 long- term toxicities follow -up is recorded in the eCRF.  
8.2 Study Termination   
The whole study may be discontinued at the discretion of the investigator or Sponsor in the 
event of the following:  
• Occurrence of AE s which by virtue of their nature, severity and duration are considered 
to necessitate study termination . 
• Medical or ethical reasons affecting the continued performance of the study. 
• Difficulties in the recruitment of patients . 
• Cancellation of drug development. 
9 TREATMENT PLAN  
9.1 Study Treatment  
Rituximab , lilotomab  and Betalutin can all be administered on an outpatient basis. The patient 
should be under surveillance at the hospital at least 2 hours after administration  of Betalutin  
(unless local regulations require a longer surveillanc e period) . 
In case of hypersensitivity reactions, study drug administration must be stopped immediately. 
Medicinal products for the treatment of hypersensitivity reactions , e.g, adrenaline, 
antihistamines and corticosteroids must be available for immediate  use in the event of an 
allergic reaction during administration of rituximab, lilotomab or Betalutin.  
If extravascular administration of Betalutin or lilotomab or rituximab – that is, leakage of the 
injection to the surrounding tissue is suspected, the adm inistration must be immediately 
terminated. Rinse with isotonic saline, elevate the arm and gently massage the arm to facilitate 
lymphatic drainage. 
Detailed written instruction s on labelling and preparation will be given to the personnel prior 
to patient inclusion. See also Investigator’s Brochure.  
9.1.1 Investigational Drug Product Betalutin   
The generic name for Betalutin is lutetium (177Lu)-lilotomab  satetraxetan . The antibody 
lilotomab  is labelled  with 177Lu via the chelator p -SCN -benzyl- DOTA. 177Lu is a β-particle  
emitter with a physical half -life of 6.7 days.  The radiopharmaceutical Betalutin is a 
ready -to-use, sterile, non -pyrogenic, clear and slightly yellowish  aqueous solution of lutetium 
(177Lu)-lilotomab  satetraxetan  for intravenous administration.  
The product is isotonic and has a pH of 6.4-7.4 . The radioactive concentration at the reference 
date will depend on the dose level  and the patient body weight; however, the dose is capped for 
patients who weigh more than 130 kg (patients heavier than 130 kg will receive the dose for a 
130 kg patient). When administered on a day other than the reference day, the volume should 
be corrected according to the physical decay table included in the Drug Handling Pl an. The 
measured Betalutin dose must be +/ -10% of the intended prescribed dose. 
The product is supplied in 20 mL single dose glass vials, closed with rubber stoppers and

 aluminium  seals. The amount per vial will depend on the dose level.  
9.1.2 Supply and Packaging   
Betalutin is shipped as a Type A radioactive package according to international transportation 
guidelines for radioactive materials.  
Each vial will be label led with a unique vial number, identifying th e specific vial as well as the 
batch number. The content of the labels will be according to national requirements. 
Each vial should be used for one patient only. 
9.1.3 Handling and Storage of Betalutin   
A dedicated person, who has the responsibility delegated fr om the Principal Investigator, will 
be responsible for handling and storage of Betalutin . The dedicated person has the overall 
responsibility for handling and storage of Betalutin  at the study centre ; i.e. that the vials 
containing Betalutin are  correctly received and recorded, handled and stored safely and 
properly, and used in accordance with this protocol. Betalutin  is a radiopharmaceutical and 
should be handled by individuals who are qualified by training and experience in the safe 
handling of radionuclides. A deputy person should also be nominated.  
The vials must be stored in a secure facility. Betalutin should be stored in the lead container in 
a refrigerator, 2°C to 8°C. Storage must be in accordance with local requirements for radioactive 
materials. Betalutin  must reach  room temperature before patient administration.  
See the Drug Handling Plan for further details. 
9.1.4 Preparation and A dministration of Betalutin   
The total activity to be injected will be calculated volumetrically using the patient’s body 
weight on the day of injection (kg), the dose level, and decay  correction factor (DC) to correct 
for physical decay of 177Lu. A table with correction factors is provided in the Drug Handling 
Plan. The measured  Betalutin dose must be +/ -10% of the intended prescribed dose . The dose 
will be capped for patients who weigh more than 130 kg (patients heavier than 130 kg will 
receive the dose for a 130 kg patient).  
The total amount (volume to be drawn into the syringe) to be administered  to a patient should 
be calculated as follows:  
Body weight (kg) × Betalutin Dose MBq/kg b.w.  
DC × radioactive concentration at the reference (calibration) date MBq/mL  = Volume to be 
injected ( mL) 
 
Filling of the syringe should take place at a dedicated area for working with radioactive 
solutions . Personnel should wear medical gloves and eye protection during syringe filling to 
prevent contamination of the radioactive solution of skin and eyes. The individual responsible 
for Betalutin  preparation will draw the correct volume of the study drug into a syringe , and 
control the correct activity for administration in a dose calibrator . Data regarding activity and 
volume to be injected for the various patients should be recorded on the study drug 
administration eCRF page.  
To maintain traceability, there are four labels for  syringe shield and forms  per patient, with 
identification of  batch, vial , and patient . One (1) sticker with the identification  number should

 be attached  to the study medication preparation page, the other on the syringe shield and the 
third to the study medication administration page.  
The syringe should be shielded from β radiation during preparation and administration of the 
patient doses. Aseptic technique should be used in th e administration of Betalutin. Each patient 
will receive one dose in accordance with the treatment schedule. Betalutin will be given as a 
slow bolus injection using a shielded syringe driver . After administration , the syringe and line 
must be flushed with a minimum of 10  mL of sterile normal saline (0.9% NaCl) after injection, 
as detailed in the Drug Handling Plan. The equipment used in connection with the preparation 
and administration of the study medication , are to be treated as radioactive waste and sho uld 
be disposed in accordance with hospital procedure for handling of radioactive material. 
9.1.5 Patient Protection   
The patient will receive verbal and written instructions in accordance with the hospital radiation 
safety policies and procedures regarding precautions, as necessary, after receiving the 
radioactive drug. Betalutin can be administered on an outpatient basis. 
9.1.6 Rituximab I nfusion   
Rituximab  will be ordered through the standard procedure at the study centre . The product 
should be administered according to the approved product information (prescribing information) 
for rituximab.  Pre-medication  consisting of an antipyretic and an antihistamin e, e.g. paracetamol 
and Dexchlorpheniramine or cetirizine , should always be administered before each infusion of 
rituximab. The t ypes of pre -medication used prior to rituximab infusion will follow each 
hospital ’s routine, including any use of corticosteroids . The prepared rituximab solution should 
be administered as an intravenous infusion through a dedicated line. It should not be 
administered as an intravenous push or bolus.  The standard hospital procedure for infusion of 
rituximab will be followed. If an AE occurs, the infusion will be stopped. W hen the symptoms 
have disappeared, the infusion will be re-started with 50% decreased infusion rate. 
9.1.7 Lilotomab I nfusion   
Lilotomab will be delivered in vials of approximately 5 mg/m L lilotomab . Lilotomab for 
infusion will be prepared aseptically at the hospital and made ready for infusion  as detailed in 
the Lilotomab Drug Handling Plan . Pre-medication consisting of an antipyretic and 
antihistamine medication should be administered before infusion of lilotomab . 
Lilotomab will be infused within 4 hours prior to the Betalutin administration . The infusion 
rate will be 100 m L/hour. For doses of lilotomab given on a BSA basis, this should be calculated 
using the duBois calculation. The infusion rate may be adjusted depending on how well it is 
tolerated. If the patient experiences an AE such as a drop in blood pressure, chills, fever , or 
dyspnoea the infusion will be stopped. When the symptoms disappear,  the infusion will start 
again with 50% reduced infusion rate.  
9.1.7.1  Part A (phase I and phase IIa): 
Lilotomab will be given by intravenous infusion over 60 minutes. 
• In Arm 1, a total of 40 mg lilotomab  will be given.

Confidential  Page  75 of 165  
 • In Arm 4, the dose of lilotomab  will be 100 mg/m2 up to a maximum body surface area 
of 2.7 m2.   
• In Arm 5 , the patients will receive 60  mg/m2 lilotomab  up to a maximum body surface 
area of 2.7m2.  
9.1.7.2  Part B ( FL phase IIb): 
In Part B, the patients will be randomi sed 1:1 (stratified for double -refractory patients) to 
receive either 40 mg or 100 mg/m2 lilotomab up to a maximum body surface area of 2.7  m2 
(that is, maximum of lilotomab 270  mg).  
Following the interim analysis performed on the first 47 patients with FL, patients will receive 
the regimen lilotomab 40mg and Betalutin 15 MBq/kg  (“40/15”).  
All patient s must be observed closely during the infusion and in the first hour after the infusion.  
Blood pressure and heart rate are measured before infusion and subsequently every 15 minutes 
until the patient seems clinically stable. The blood pressure and heart rate must be measured at 
30 minutes and at 1 hour after the infusion has ended. Temperature is measured before, and 
1 hour after, the lilotomab  infusion. If the patient experiences any reactions, vital signs must be 
recorded frequently until the patient is stable. Any AEs will be recorded in the eCRF.  
9.1.7.3  Part C (Pharmacokinetic Cohort, phase IIa) 
In Part C, p atients will receive the “40/15”  regimen and will therefore receive 40  mg lilotomab .  
9.1.8 Drug Accountability   
The study medications , rituximab, Betalutin and lilotomab, should be kept in a secure place 
and must be administered only to patients in the study. For all 3 drugs, an appointed individual 
is responsible for maintaining accurate records of the study medication . A list of study  
medication (received, administered to patients, destroyed) must be prepared and signed by the 
dedicated person responsible for drug handling. 
When the drug accountability has been monitored by the Sponsor representative, the vials can 
be destroyed in accordance with hospital procedure. Betalutin should be stored for a minimum 
of 3 months (>10 half- lives) before disposal.  
See the Drug Handling Plans for further details. 
9.2 Methods of Assigning Patients to Treatment  
9.2.1 Part A  (phase I  and phase IIa) 
A screening number will be assigned when a patient signs the informed consent form and is 
evaluated for inclusion into the study. The patients will then undergo screening procedures and 
those who meet the inclusion and not the exclusion criteria will be assigned a unique 
identification number. This number will be assigned sequentially by the hospital personnel. 
Once assigned, this number must not be used again for a different patient. 
When an eligible patient has consented to be included in the study, a “Drug Order Form” will 
be sent from site to the Sponsor . The Sponsor’s dedicated person who is responsible for 
ordering of the IMP  will send the IMP order to the manufacturer and the IMP will be shipped 
to the study centre .

 Cohort enrolment was closely monitored to ensure that patients were only enrolled following 
the approp riate review of the data from previous patients (see Section  6.2.2 ). Arms  1 and 2 
were enrolled sequentially. Enrolment into either Arms 3 or 4 was based on the investigator /site 
preference .  
9.2.2 Part B  (FL phase IIb)   
At the time of evaluation of the patient for enrolment , a patient  number will be assigned via an 
Interactive Web Response system (IWRS). In the randomised period, patients will be enrolled 
to receive one of the  two dosing regimens: “40/15” or “100/20” . There will be central 
stratification for double refractory patients.  After the interim analysis  performed on the first 
47 patients entered to Part B, the study will proceed with a single regimen, and all patients will 
be assigned to “40/15” treatment regimen.  Patients with a prior auto logous SCT and/or platelet  
count≥100 ×109/L but <150 ×109/L will receive a reduced dose of Betalutin  as follows: 
• Patients with  a prior auto logous- SCT and platelet count ≥150×109/L will receive 
Betalutin at the reduced dose of 12.5 MBq/kg.   
• Patients with a prior auto logous- SCT and platelet count ≥100×109/L but <150 ×109/L 
will receive Betalutin at the reduced dose of 10 MBq/kg. 
• Patients without a prior autologous- SCT and platelet count ≥100×109/L but <150×109/L) 
will receive Betalutin at the reduced dose of 12.5 MBq/kg.  
A patient is double -refractory if they are refractory to both an anti -CD20 therapy and an 
alkylating agent therapy. The definitions of refractory to each treatment are as follows: 
i. Anti-CD20 therapy:  
i. No response (no CR or PR) during rituximab or anti-CD20 containing therapy, or 
ii. A response (CR/PR) lasting less than 6 months after the completion of a regimen 
of rituximab or other anti -CD20 therapy (including occurrence of progressive 
disease (PD) during rituximab/anti -CD20 maintenance therapy, or within 
6 months of completion of ma intenance therapy).   
ii. Alkylating agent:  
i. No response (no CR or PR) during alkylating agent therapy comprising at least 2 
cycles of treatment, or  
ii. The occurrence of progressive disease (PD) within 6 months of the completion of 
alkylating agent therapy comprisi ng at least 2 cycles of treatment.   
The purpose of stratification is to balance the number of double refractory patients between 
treatment regimens. No analysis within strata are planned. Randomis ation records are selected 
by finding the next available minimum patient randomi sation number , within the stratum,  in 
the central randomi sation list.  
Site users will confirm in the IWRS system when all screening procedures have been completed 
and the patient is considered eligible for enrolment . A medical monitor will review the patient 
and confirm that the patient is eligible in the IWRS system  before  the patient is enrolled .  
9.2.3 Part C (Pharmacokinetic Cohort, phase IIa)

 IWRS  system . All patients will receive the “40/15” treatment regimen   
Site users will confirm in the IWRS system when all screening procedures have been completed 
and the patient is considered eligible for enrolment. A Sponsor medical monitor will  review the 
patient and confirm that the patient is eligible in the IWRS system before the patient is entered.  
9.3 Prior and Concomitant Therapy   
Information about previous cancer- related treatment will be collected in the eCRFs.  
All concomitant therapies , including any pre -medication given before rituximab injection  have 
to be recorded in the eCRF from the screening visit until 12 weeks after Betalutin 
administration on Day 0 of the study. The generic or trade name, indication, dose, and when 
applicable the st art and stop date will be recorded.  
Haematology parameters should be careful ly checked prior to administration of any other 
myelosuppressive therapy.  
Warfarin should be changed to low -molecular heparin. The dose of low -molecular heparin 
should be temporarily reduced if platelets are below 50 ×109/L, and be temporarily stopped if 
platelets are below 25 ×109/L. 
Prophylaxis with allopurinol for tumour lysis will be permitted at the discretion of the 
investigator. 
9.4 Supportive Care Guidelines   
Persistent neutropenia ( neutrophils/granulocytes < 0.5 ×109/L) without fever  
Patients with persistent neutropenia will be started on G -CSF 5 µg/kg/d aily given subcutaneous  
until the neutrophil count has reached the local hospital’s reference range.  
Neutropenia with fever (Neutrophils/granulocytes <1×109/L; fever  >38°C) 
Blood cultures w ill be obtained from the patient. T he patient should start on empiric antibiotics 
as long as clinically indicated . Provision of G-CSF to such patients  is highly recomme nded. 
Severe thrombocytopenia (platelets <5 ×109/L) or bleeding with platelets <50 ×109/L  
Patients will be transfused with platelet s to maintain a platelet count >20 ×109/L or higher if 
clinically indicated to control bleeding. Epsilon aminocaproic acid may be given to patients 
with mucosal bleeding and platelet count <50 x 109/L. 
Severe anaemia (haemoglobin <8.0 g/dL) 
Patients will be transfused  with packed red cells to maintain haemoglobin level  >8.0 g/dL. 
9.5 Treatment Compliance   
Patients will receive Betalutin treatment under supervision of a nuclear medicine specialist (or 
any other specialist physician authori sed to administer radiopharmaceuticals  per local 
regulations). Study centre  personnel will check the administration volume and total 
radioactivity injected and will record the activity dose and volume injected in the patient’s 
source documents and e CRF.  
Patients will receive infusions of lilotomab and rituximab under surveillance by trained

measurements by use of whole -body and SPECT/CT scans will be performed  on up to 3 
patients in each dose level in phase I, if feasible. Patient fixation will be done before the first 
gamma scan.  
In Part A ( phase IIa ), Part B (FL phase IIb) and Part C  (Pharmacokinetic  Cohort) , 
pharmacokinetic and SPECT/CT assessments will be p erformed at a subset of sites .

10.1.1  Blood C learance  
10.1.1.1  Schedule  
Part A (phase I  and phase IIa) 
The number of samples for assessment of blood clearance will depend on whether the patient 
is going to be included in the serial whole  body study or not . The patients not participating in 
the serial whole  body study are allowed to leave the hospital about 2 hours after Betalutin 
injection, and therefore the number of samples will be reduced. The sampling for these patients 
will be at the following time points after Betalutin administration: 0, 5, 60 and 120 min utes, 
24 hours, and 2, 3, 4, 7 (±1), 14 (±2 ) and 21 (±2) days. Blood samples will be assessed for the 
presence of lilotomab,  Betalutin , 177Lu and 177Lu-satetraxetan.  The time points mentioned are 
approximate time points. The exact time point the sample is taken need to be recorded in the 
eCRF. The sampling at day 3 will be optional, since it is the only test to be taken that day. The 
blood for analysis at Day 14 and 21 , will be taken  from the blood used for the 
biochemistry/h aematology analyses, when feasible. These blood samples will be taken and 
might be analysed at the local hospitals, and can therefore be difficult to obtain.  
Each 3 -patient group will be analysed continuously and adaptation of the sampling times may 
became necessary depending on the res ults.  
Whole blood samples will be shipped to the laboratory at Nordic Nanovector ASA (Oslo), for 
analyses. The radioactivity in whole blood will be determined from each sample.   
Part B (FL phase IIb) and Part C (P harmacokinetic  Cohort phase IIa)  
Pharmacokinetics in vitro  assessments will be performed only at selected sites only , for a 
subset of p atients (see Table 6-9 ).  
Sampling of peripheral blood samples will be performed at selected time points (see below). 
The time points mentioned are approximate time points, with time win dows show in  Table  6-9. 
The exact t ime point when the sample is taken need s to be recorded in the eCRF. Each patient 
group will be monitored continuously and  adaptat ion of the sampling t imes may become 
necessary depending on the results.  
10.1.1.2  In Vitro Assessments  
Betalutin Pharmacokinetics - Total radioactivity or Total payload in blood

 expected to observe  free 177Lu in blood samples due to its high binding affinity to satetraxetan 
and d iethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA). DTPA is included in the Betalutin formulation 
in order to chelate the 177Lu not radiolabelled  to satetraxetan lilotomab. 177Lu-DTPA chelate 
has a fast renal clearance  [30], [57], [58] .  
In Part A  of the study, a volume of at least 1.5 mL will be collected on 
ethylenediaminetetra -acetic acid ( EDTA ) or heparin at each agreed time point (see  Table  6-5 
and Table  6-6). An exact volume of 1 mL of peripheral blood will be transferred on- site into a 
radio -immune assay (RIA) tube and shipped to Nordic Nanovector ASA (Oslo, Norway) for 
radioactivity measurement. At Day 14 and 21, the peripheral blood sample  of 1 mL used for 
the radioactivity measurement will be collected from the biochemistr y or h aematology 
collection tube when feasible.  
In Part B  and Part C  of the study, a volume of approximately 2 mL of peripheral blood will 
be collected on EDTA in a dedicated collection tube at each agreed time point (see  Table  6-9 
and below).  An exact volume of 1  mL of peripheral blood will be transferred on -site into a 
RIA tube. Radioactiv ity meas urement will be performed at Nordic Nanovector ASA (Oslo, 
Norway).  
Sampl ing of peripheral blood for Betalutin PK (radioactivity) will be performed at the 
following time points:  
• Before lilotomab administration (baseline)  
• After Betalutin administration:  
- 5 (±2), and 60 (±10) minutes. 
- Hours: 2 (±15 minutes), 24 (±4 hours), 48 (±24 hours) and 96 (±24 hours). 
- Days: 7 (±1 day), 21 ±2 days), 28 days (±2 days) and 35 (±2 days). 
The time points mentioned are approximate time points. The exact time point when the sample 
is taken needs to be recorded in the eCRF. Each patient group will be monitored continuously, 
and adaptation of the sampling times may become necessary depending on the results.  
Instructions for handling procedures, preparation, storage and shipping of the peripheral blood 
samples will be provided in the Betalutin pharmac okinetics laboratory manual prepared by 
Nordic Nanovector ASA (Oslo, Norway) for this study. 
The total radioactivity per mL of blood will be determined from each sample. 
Total lilotomab antibodies in se rum (Total antibodies PK, Part B and Part C )  
In Part B  and Part C  of the study, a volume of approximately 4 mL of peripheral blood will be 
collected in a dedicated serum tube at each agreed time point (see  Table  6-9 and below ). Serum 
samples will be isolated , aliquoted and frozen in cryovials at -20°C on -site until shipment on 
dry ice the day after collection  to the Covance Central Laboratories (Geneva, Switzerland for 
non-United States ( US) patients and Indianapolis, Indiana for US patients), where they will be 
biobanked for future use. M easurement of total circulating antibodies in serum (lilotomab, 
lilotomab satetrax etan, and Betalutin) will be performed  by ELISA. 
Sampling of peripheral blood for measurement of circulating antibodies in serum 
(concentration) will be performed at the following approximate time points: 
• Before lilotomab administration (baseline)

Instructions for handling procedures, preparation, storage and shipping of the serum samples 
will be provided in the Covance laboratory manual for this study. 
10.1.2  Urine Clearance (Part  A) 
In Part A , phase I , Arm 1, spot samples of urine will be measured for total radioactivity after 
Betalutin injection at Days 1, 4, 7 , and 28 for 3 patients in each dose level, if feasible (see  
Table  6-6). 
In Part A , phase I , Arms 2, 3, 4, 5 and phase IIa (optional), urine collecti on will be performed 
when feasible during the first 24 hours af ter Betalutin injection . The first void will be collected 
separately. Spot samples of urine will be collected after the first whole- body scan  e.g. 2 to 
4 hours after Betalutin injection, and to the next whole -body scan 24 hours after Betalutin 
injection (see  Table  6-6). The time points f or urine collection are approximate time points. The 
exact time point the samp le is taken need to be recorded in the eCRF.  
An exact volume of 1 mL of urine will be transferred on -site into a RIA tube and shipped to 
Nordic Nanovector ASA (Oslo, Norway) for radioactivity measurement. The total radioactivity 
per mL of urine will be det ermined from each sample .  
Assessment of total radioactivity in urine is not included in the Part B  or Part C . 
10.2 Biodistribution  (dosimetry) Measurements Part A  (phase I  and 
phase IIa) and Part B  (sites in Germany and in other agreed sites 
only)  
The procedure such as measurements and scanner may differ at study centres . A separate 
biodistribution and dosimetry manual will be made. The text in this section is provided as a 
guidance.  
The purpose of this part of the study is to provide estimates for the absorbed radiation dose to 
normal body structures as well as to tumour s that can be identified in the images. In order to 
perform such estimates,  it is necessary to measure, in absolute terms, the (radio -) activity in t he 
actual organs at different times after injection. Such time series enable one to estimate the 
cumulative activity in each organ and by measurements/estimates of organ weight the absorbed 
dose.

 The measurements will be performed on a SPECT/CT scanner con taining 2 gamma camera 
heads (Siemens SYMBIA –T16) equipped with medium energy collimators. This equipment 
will be used for CT, SPECT , and whole- body scanning. Two (2) separate energy windows 
positioned over the photon energy peaks at 113 keV and 208 keV with 15% window widths 
will be used. Since the upper (photon energy) peak is the most intense (11% of disintegrations) 
one may end up with using only one energy window at 208 keV. This will enable simultaneous 
acquisition in 2 energy windows, one above and one below the highest photon energy peak. 
The corresponding images will then be used to estimate and correct for the influence of 
scattered radiation. These settings wi ll be used both for whole- body scans and for SPECT. 
Quantification will be carried out partially by use of the software of the vendor and partially by 
the use of computer programs (IDL, ITT visual solutions) that are available in the hospital. A 
small plas tic flask containing <70 MBq of 177Lu will be used as radioactivity standard in the 
biodistribution study. 
The sensitivity (counts/MBq min) obtained with the planned whole-body scanning speed and 
with the actual collimator, energy window etc., will be esta blished by the use of a source of 
known activity (177Lu) in a petri-dish.  
In order to cover the entire length of the patient, whole-body scan is the only feasible way. An 
anterior and a posterior camera will acquire images simultaneously, and the attenuat ion 
corrected conjugated view technique reported earlier will be applied (34).  
There are 2 sources for acquiring attenuation data for whole- body scans: scanning with a 99mTc 
line source befo re administration of activity to th e patient or by calculating the necessary 
attenuation from CT images  (34). In the present series of measurements both of these methods 
will supplement each other – using CT data were  available in the main trunk. The collimated 
line source is positioned on the posterior gamma camera head and moves together with the 
scanning camera head.  
Patient fixation is important, and a  thin vacuum mattress will be used to ensure reproducible 
patient pose on the examination table. Nevert heless, based on earlier experience, the computer 
program (in -house development, IDL, ITT visual solutions) performs an image correlation to 
determine an y shift and correct the images accordingly. The computer program performs the 
conjugated view calculati on and attenuation correction and is designed such that regions may 
be drawn into a (conjugated view) whole-body image and be automatically reproduced in  all 
the other conjugated view whole-body images.  
In designing the quantification scheme, it is assumed that a whole-body scan has the advantages 
of producing a good overview of the activity distribution with less noise than is associated with 
a SPECT stud y. A SPECT study that should always be performed together with a CT to allow 
for attenuation correction will lead to increased patient radiation dose. It is therefore the 
intention in this study to use whole-body scans as the basis means for following the activity as 
a function of time for selected organs and if possible for tumour s, and SPECT studies where a 
3D delineation of an organ or a tumour is needed  
SPECT/CT examination of the (thorax or abdominal) region will be performed to obtain the 
cross -sectio nal data needed to estimate organ volumes. The CT part will also be used to correct 
for photon attenuation (refer to paragraph on attenuation correction above). Especially the 
SPECT examination may be influenced by photons scattered to different energies a nd 
directions inside the patient. A triple energy window technique (if feasible) will be used to 
reduce the influences on quantification.

 For Arm 1 (p hase I); 3 patients at the first dose level (10 MBq/kg) as well as one patient in the 
20 MBq/kg dose level, serial planar whole- body scan s were acquired at 2, 4, 8, and 20 hours, 
and on Days 4 and 7, including SPECT/CT images at Days 4 and 7. For Arm 2  (phase I) ; serial 
planar whole- body scan s were acquired at 2  hours , 20 hours, and on Days 4 and 7, including 
SPECT/CT images at Days 1, 4 and 7.  For Arms  3, 4 (phase I) and 5 , serial whole- body scan s 
will be acquired ~2 hours after dosing, at 24 hours  and Days 4 and 7. A window of ±1 day is 
permitted for Day 4 SPECT/CT scans. 
Three (3) patients at the different dose levels for different pre -treatment regimes  will be 
included in the biodistribution study if feasible.   
For patients enrolled in Part  A phase IIa, i f the study site has the equipment  and intends to 
conduct dosimetry , serial planar whole-body scans will be obtained on Days 0, 1, 4 , and 7, 
including SPECT/CT images at Days 1, 4, and 7. Conducting a SPECT/CT scan is preferabl e 
on Day 0 as well . SPECT/CT ex amination of the thorax and abdominal region will be 
performed. If the study site does not intend to conduct dosimetry assessments only SPECT/CT 
images at Day  4 will be conducted.  
For patients enrolled in Part B  (FL phase IIb) via sites in Germany  and in other agreed sites , 
SPECT/CT images will be made on Days 0, 1, 4 and 7.  
Full details of the scans required are provided in the dosimetry protocol. 
Together these images will enable characteri sation of the biodynamics and on that basis the 
calculation of t he cumulative activity in each organ. Dose estimates will be obtained by the use 
of the OLINDA program which is available at the hospital.  
More specifically the conjugated whole-body studies and the quantification in regions drawn 
around each organ together with assay of activity in blood will be done. It includes the 
following: 
• Estimation of whole -body retention of radioactivity at each imaging time post -injection . 
• Estimation of the individual organ uptake/retention of radioactivity at each time point  
after injection . 
• Estimate retention of administered radioactivity in blood . 
• Calculation of estimated absorbed radiation dose to target organs and possibly to 
tumours.

11.1 CD37 Expression in Tumour Biopsies  
Expression of CD37 will be a ssessed  using tumour tissue biopsy immuno histo chemistry  (IHC) . 
A patient may be enrolled without waiting for confirmation of histological diagnosis on  the 
condition that pathological materials are known to be available for review. Either an archival 
FFPE tumour tissue block if the tissue biopsy  is <2 years old or a new tumour biopsy will be 
requested  to be collected at screening . In specific cases, tumour tissue biopsies collected within 
a 2-5 year time frame could be accepted pending Sponsor approval. Alternatively, a new tumour 
biopsy will be taken for CD37 expression after the patient ’s informed consent to participate in 
the st udy. The result of the analysis  is not required for enrolment into the study.

 A new tumour tissue biopsy is to be collected at relapse and/or disease progression ( this is 
dependent on the availability of a suitable lesion  and the patient’s willingness to have a further 
biopsy ). 
In Part A, the FFPE blocks or 5 µM slides  will be sent to the pathology department of the 
Radium Hospital (Oslo, Norway)  for IHC analysis . There will be no biobanking of dedicated 
FFPE block  for future use. 
In Part B and Part C , the FFPE blocks (or 5 µM slides  – see below)  will be sent to Covance 
Central Laboratories, where they  will be biobanked for future use. If a tumour block is provide d, 
it will be returne d to the hospital upon request.  If the site can only provide 5 µM FFPE slides, 
preparation of such slides should occur only upon sponsor request to ensure integrity of the 
biomaterial for the relevant assessments.  
Instructions for handling procedures, preparation, storage and shipping of the biological 
material will be p rovided in the laboratory manual for this study. 
The results of these analyses will be reported to the clinical study database . 
11.2 Genomic biomarkers (Part B only)  
Subject to separate patient informed consent, tumour tissue biopsies (archival tumour tissue 
biopsies or newly tumour tissue biopsies collected at screening and subsequently at relapse or 
progression) will be collected  for the purpose of cancer related gene expression . The biopsies 
will be used to identify predictive biomarkers for Betalutin treatme nt (48, 49).  
Additionally, at screening visit and subject to separate patient informed consent, an approximate 
volume of 2 mL of peripheral blood sample will be collected to perform HLA class I and II 
haplotype, to further understand the anti -tumour T -cell response and why a patient may develop 
an ADA response towards lilotomab/Betalutin (41, 42), respectively. 
The results of these analyses are not required for enrolment into the study and will not  have 
impact on patient management - but could be published in scientific journals.  
Instructions for handling procedures, preparation, storage and shipping of the biological 
material will be provided in the laboratory manual for this study . 
11.3 Biobanking  
The patient will be asked to contribute samples in accordance w ith this clinical trial  and allow 
part of the available tumour biopsy samples (archived or newly obtained) and peripheral blood 
sample to be biobanked for future use  including but not exclusive to genomic biomarkers 
expression analysis (DNA, RNA, protein ) and other biomarkers. 
Biobanking of the biological samples  for future use will be performed at Covance Central 
Laboratories in Indianapolis, Indiana for US patients ; in Singapore for patients in 
Asia/Australia)  and in Geneva, Switzerland for all other  patients . Analysis of samples will be 
undertaken by an accredited laboratory either in the EU or USA. Any samples remaining after 
the end of the clinical tri al will be d estroyed. If a tumou r block is provided, it will be returned to 
the hospital upon request.

 12 EFFICACY ASSESSMENTS  
Contrast enhanced CT and PET/CT scans will be evaluated at the study centre (s). 
For Part A  (phase I  and phase IIa), tumour response will be determined by  investigator 
assessment.  Cheson criteria Versions 1999 and 2007 will be applied  (35, 36).  
For Part B  (FL phase I Ib) and Part C  (Pharmacokinetic C ohort) , investigator assessment 
will initially  be applied as a measure for assessment of  tumour response and any urgent patient 
management decisions . Tumour response will also be determined by independent central 
review  and this assessment used as a basis for all protocol guidelines for management of the 
patient related to diseas e progression status . In presence of disease progression per investigator 
assessment, tumour assessments should continue until disease progression is documented by 
independent central review, unless an urgent patient management decision is required. All 
urgent patient management decisions will be documented.  Cheson criteria Version 2014 will 
be applied  (40).  
12.1 Timing of Assessments and Imaging Modalities  
12.1.1  Contrast Enhanced CT Examination 
A baseline contrast -enhanced CT scan must be  performed  within 4 weeks prior to first 
rituximab  infusion. Table  6-5, Table  6-7 and Table  6-8, shows the frequency of subsequent 
contrast -enhanced CT scans  per patient  for follow -up. 
A CT volume scan re -constructed in up to 5  mm slides  with use of intravenously injected 
contrast agent will be performed per examination . The target lesions will be selected and 
measured at baseline, and followed at each efficacy assessment. The longest perpendicular 
diameters (major and minor axis) will be  recorded in the eCRF. 
12.1.2  MRI Examination 
For patients unable to receive a contrast -enhanced CT scan due to allergy, a MRI examination 
is permitted.  
12.1.3  PET/CT Examination  
The term ‘PET/CT imaging’ refers to PET imaging - which is typically  undertaken on a 
combin ed PET/CT scanner.  
PET/CT imaging will be done at baseline,  3 ( Week  12) and 6 months after Betalutin 
administration for all patients . Baseline imaging must be performed  within 4 weeks prior to 
administration of rituximab infusion . At these timepoints, both a PET scan and a separate 
contrast -enhanced CT scan (or MRI for those patients allergic to contrast) are to be undertaken. 
The same combined machine can be used if the CT scanner is a diagnostic quality CT scanner. 
At subsequent timepoints (Month 9 onwards), only a contrast -enhanced CT scan (or MRI) is 
required.  
Standard institutional guidelines will be followed . The patient must have  fasted for 6 hours 
prior to PET/CT imaging, water is allowed. For patients with known hyperglyca emia or 
diabetes,  the blood glucose level must be <  11 mmol/L before injection of 18Fluorodoxyglucose 
(FDG ). Anti-diabetic drugs cannot be taken on the day of PET/CT examination.

 PET/CT examination will be performed by a commercial combined PET/CT scanner. All scans 
should be performed on the same camera. PET/CT imaging will be performed about 60 to 
70 minutes  after intravenous administration of 5  to 10 mCi (185 to 370 MBq) of FDG. Same 
activity +/ - 20% and time window must be used in the subsequent PET scans.  
PET/CT scans will be done before contras t enhanced CT (or MRI for patients unable to receive 
contrast) when both modalities are to be done on the same day . 
All measurements of up take will be based on  standardis ed uptake (SUV) values. Lesions 
<15 mm in  short axis with abnormal activity: focal, above the surrounding background, above 
average liver SUV.  
Guidelines for baseline CT examination:  
1) Target lesions on the CT scans do not need to match those evaluated on the PET scan. 
2) Target nodes should be chosen according to applicable Cheson criteria, see Section 12.2 . 
3) Approximately 6 target nodes should be selected; there must be at least one target node. 
4) The largest target nodes should be selected . 
5) Nodes should be from different body regions if possible. 
6) Mediastinal and retro peritoneal nodes should be included as target nodes if involved.  
7) A measurable node must have a longest diameter (L di) greater than 1.5 cm. 
8) A measurable extranodal lesion should have an Ld i greater than 1.0 cm .  
Guidelines for baseline PET examination:  
1) Target lesions on the CT scans do not need to match those evaluated on the PET scan . 
2) The lesions with the highest activity level should be chosen for the PET scan. 
Part A: Selection of lesions for follow- up PET .  
“Modified ECOG criteria ”: 
1) O nly sites of abnormality at baseline are evaluated . 
2) A ll positive nodal sites must have an anatomic correlate . 
3) A ctivity in lung, bone/bone marrow, liver and spleen is considered abnormal only if focal 
and clearly discernible. 
4) New foci are considered positive only if they are  associated with a lesion on CT. 
12.2 Definitions of Tumour Response Criteria : Part A (phase I  and 
phase IIa)  
For Part A , tumour response will be determined by investigator assessment. Cheson criteria 
Versions 1999 and 2007 will be applied (36).  
For the 3 month evaluation, the PET is used for the response assessment.  
In case of CR, repeat a bone marrow biopsy if the patient had a positive bone marrow biopsy 
at screening . 
For the 6 month assessment,  the PET is NOT used for evaluation of (possible) progressive 
disease; only the CT scan should be used for PD.

 12.2.1  Part A Response Criteria I; using CT only per Cheson 1999 
The response criteria used is defined in Cheson et. Al. 1999 (35) were used for all CT 
examinations.  
• Complete remission (CR)  
Disappearance of all disease -related symptoms and measurable lesions, including 
normalisation of other abnormal initial parameters (i f any) such as bioch emical 
abnormalities definitely assignable to lymphoma (e.g. S -LDH ), X-rays and bone marrow. 
All lymph nodes must have regressed to ≤1.5 cm in their largest transverse diameter and 
to <1.0 cm for those nodes which were 1.1 to 1.5 cm bef ore treatment.  
• Complete remission unconfirmed (Cru ) 
The criteria of a CR are fulfilled, except that residual lymph node(s) mass greater than 
1.5 cm have regressed by more than 75% in the SPD in all measurable and evaluable 
lesions. A C ru should when possible be assigned to a CR or PR by histological 
examination.  
• Partial remission (PR)  
Decre ase of at least 50% in the SPD of the six largest dominant nodes or nodal masses 
(should be clearly measurable in at least 2 perpendicular dimensions, be from disparate 
body regions and include mediastinal and retroperitoneal areas of disease whenever the se 
sites are involved). There should be no increase in the size of the other nodes, liver, or 
spleen. Splenic and hepatic nodules must regress by at least 50% in the SPD. With the 
exception of splenic and hepatic nodules, involvement of other organs is considered 
assessable and not measurable disease. No new lesions appearing.  
• No Change/Stable disease (SD)  
The patient does not qualify for complete  (CR) or partial remission  (PR) or progressive 
disease  (PD).  
• Progressive disease (PD)  
≥50% increase from nadir in the SPD of any previously identified abnormal node or the 
occurrence of new lesions. 
12.2.2  PET/CT Score  
PET is scored on a 5 -point scale, and follow-up will be assessed as described below . In addition, 
SUV max will be recorded,  and lean body mass (SUL) max is optional . In case of discrepancy 
between the criteria below and SUV max/SUL max the investigators will be involved in decision 
making. 
Images will be evaluated and scored according to a 5 -point scale  (5PS) . The PET /CT scans will 
be scored with reference to sites of presumed lymphomatous involvement on the PET /CT 
staging scan ( Deauvil le criteria) .

12.3 Definitions of Tumour Response Criteria : Part B  and Part  C  
For Part B  and Part C , investigator assessment will initially be applied as a measure for 
assessment of tumour response and any urgent patient management decisions . Tumour 
response will also be determined by independent central review  and this assessment used as a 
basis for all protocol guidelines for management of t he patient related to disease progression 
status, wherever possible . In presence of disease progression per investigator assessment, 
tumour assessments should continue until disease progression is documented by independent 
central review, unless an urgent patient management decision is required. All urgent patient 
management decisions will be documented . Cheson criteria Version 2014 (40) will be applied 
(see Table  12-1 ).

It is recogni sed that in Waldeyer’s ring or 
extranodal sites with high physiologic uptake or 
with activation within spleen or marrow (eg 
with chemotherapy or myeloid colony -
stimulating fact ors), uptake may be greater than 
normal mediastinum and/or liver. In this 
circumstance, complete metabolic response may 
be inferred if uptake at sites of initial 
involvement is no greater than surrounding 
normal tissue even if the tissue has high 
physiologic uptake.  Target nodes/nodal masses 
must regress to  ≤1.5 cm in L di

At interim, these findings suggest responding 
disease  
 
At end-of-treatment , these findings indicate 
residual di sease  ≥50% decrease in SPD of up

An AE is defined as the appearance of (or worsening of any pre -existing) undesirable sig n(s), 
symptom(s) or medical condition(s) that occur after the patient’s signed informed consent has 
been obtained. 
An AE can be any unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory 
finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of an IMP, whether or not 
considered related to the IMP.  
Abnormal laboratory values or test results occurring after informed consent constitute A Es only 
if they: 
• induce clinical signs or symptoms, or 
• are considered clinically significant, or 
• require therapy (e.g. transfusion) or  
• require changes in medications. 
Laboratory  abnormalities that meet the criteria for AE should be followed until they have 
returned to normal.  Laboratory  abnormalities not requiring clinical interventio n or further 
investigation will be captured as part of overall laboratory monitoring, and should not be 
reported as adverse events . 
Progression of underlying malignancy should not be reported as an AE, unless the investigator 
considers that the study drugs  contributed to lymphoma progression (by a means other than 
lack of effect). A Es separate from the progression of malignancy (e.g. deep venous thrombosis

 at the time of progression) should be reported as per usual guidelines with proper attribution 
regardi ng relatedness to study treatment. 
Each event will be evaluated by the investigator for clinical significance, severity and CTCAE 
grading, and should be recorded in the eCRF. AEs will be assessed according to the CTCAE 
Version 4.0 or later as applicable . The following information should be recorded: 
• Whether the event is serious or non-serious 
• Relationship to study drug 
• Severity of the event  
• Onset date and time  
• Resolution date and time, or date and time of death 
• Action taken  
• Outcome of the event  
13.1.2  Definition of Adverse Drug Reaction  
An ADR  is all untoward and unintended responses to IMP related to any dose administered.  
All AEs judged by either the reporting investigator or the Sponsor as having a reasonable causal 
relationship to a n IMP qualify as ADRs. The expression ‘reasonable causal relationship’ means 
to convey in general that there is evidence or argument to suggest a causal relationship. 
13.1.3  Definition of Serious Adverse Event  
A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as one of the following: 
• Results in death  (excluding deaths due to disease progression). The reported AE should 
be the AE that caused the death.. 
• Is life -threatening. 
• Requires inpatient hospitalis ation or prolongation of existing inpatients’ hospitali sation . 
• Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity . 
• Is medically important , i.e. defined as an event that jeopardi ses the patient or may require 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. 
• Constitutes  a congenital anomaly/birth defect. 
Life-threatening in the definition of a SAE refers to an event in which the patient was at risk of 
death at the time of event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused 
death if it were more severe.  Medical judgment  should be exercised in deciding whether an 
AE/ADR is serious in other situations.   
Hospitali sation for elective surgery or surgery which takes place during the reporting period 
but was planned prior to enrolment is not to be reported as an SAE (unless the reason for surgery 
or any complications during or after surgery fulfil any other of the serio usness criteria).

Confidential  Page  107 of 165 
 13.1.4  Definition of Unexpected Adverse Drug Reaction  
An unexpected A DR is an A DR of which the nature or severity is not consistent with the 
applicable product information (e.g. Investigator’s Brochure for an unapproved investigational 
product or summary of product characteristics for an authori sed product  i.e. the Investigator’s 
Brochure for Betalutin or the approved product information (prescribing information) for 
rituximab ). When the outcome of the A DR is not consistent with the applicable pr oduct 
information this A DR should be considered as unexpected . Reports must also  be considered as 
unexpected if they add significant information on the specificity or severity of an expected 
ADR.  
The expectedness of an AE/ADR will be determined by the Sponsor.  
13.1.5  Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction  
All suspected A DRs that are considered related to any o f the study medication and are both 
unexpected and serious (meeting the definition of a suspected, unexpected serious adverse 
reaction [SUSAR] ) are subject to expedited reporting. It is the Sponsor who reports the 
SUSARs, based on information from the investigator , see Section  13.3.1 . 
13.1.6  Definition of Treatment -Emergent Adverse Event  
Treatment -emergent adverse events  (TEAEs) are defined as events which occur following the 
first injection of study treatment, or that started p rior to the first injection and worsened during 
treatment.  
13.1.7  Definition of Adverse Events of Special Interest  
AESI are defined as events (serious or non -serious) which are of medical concern specific to 
Betalutin, for which ongoing monitoring and rapid communication by the investigator to the 
Sponsor may be appropriate. Such events may require further investigation in order to 
characteri se them. One potential risk for Betalutin is that as an 
antibody-radionuclide-conjugate , it may over long -term induce secondary malignancies, 
including MDS, acute leukaemia  and others.  
During the protocol -mandated follow -up visits,  the development of secondary malignancies, 
myelodysplastic syndrome, acute leukaemia  or aplastic anaemia  will be assessed by the 
investigator . These events will be recorded as SAEs .  
AESIs  are defined on the basis of an ongoing review of the safety data, and are reflected in the 
Investigators Brochure. 
13.1.8  Assessments of Adverse Events ; Seriousness , Causality, and Severity  
Each individual AE should be evaluated by the investigator with regard to date of onset, its 
seriousness, severity, and duration, causal relationship to the IMP and/or concomitant therapy 
and outcome. 
Seriousness will be determined according to the definition s in Section  13.1.3 .  
Causality  will be determined for all AEs. All A Es judged as having a reasonable suspected 
causal relationship to an IMP qualify as AD Rs (as defined in Section 13.1.2 ).

Confidential  Page  108 of 165 
 In the eCRF the investigator’s opinion of the relationship of the AE(s) to the IMP, will be 
categori sed as unrelated, possibly or probably related, as defined below. 
Unrelated:  An AE which after careful examination at the time of evaluation, is judged to be 
clearly and incontrovertibly due to extraneous causes (disease, environment, etc.) and do not 
meet the criteria for drug relationship listed under possible or probable. 
Possibl e: An AE which after careful examination at the time of evaluation, the connection 
with the IMP administration cannot be ruled out. 
Probable:  An AE which after careful examination at the time of evaluation, the connection 
to the IMP administration appears,  with a high degree of certainty, to be related to the IMP  
In addition to the investigator’s own description of the AE, each AE will be encoded by 
Sponsor’s representative, according to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities  
(MedDRA).  
Severity : The term “severe” is used to describe the intensity (severity) of a specific event.  Note 
that it is not the same as “serious”, which is based on patient/event outcome or action criteria. 
The severity of all events will be graded according to the CTCAE Vers ion 4.0 (or later, as 
applicable)  by the investigator . For events not listed in the toxicity table, severity should be 
recorded as:  
Grade 1 :  Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; 
intervention not indicated.   
Grade 2 :  Moderate; minimal, local or non-invasive intervention indicated; limiting 
age-appropriate instrumental activities of daily living ( ADL )* 
Grade 3 :  Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; 
hospitalis ation  or prolongation of hospitalis ation  indicated; disabling; limiting self -care ADL ** 
Grade 4 :  Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated. 
Grade 5 :  Death related to AE . 
*Instrumental ADL refer to preparing meals, shopping for groceries or clothes, using the 
telephone, managing money, etc. 
**Self- care ADL refer to bathing, dressing  and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking 
medications, and not bedridden. 
13.2 Reporting of Adverse Events  
Any AEs that occur after a patient has signed the Informed Consent Form and up to 12 weeks 
after Day 0, must be reported, whether or not it  is considered related to any of the study 
medications . 
After 12 weeks post last administration of study treatment, only new onset AESIs, and study 
treatment -related AEs and SAEs must be reported when they come to the investigator’s 
attention.   
All A Es will be reported in the patient eCRFs. If more than one AE occurs, each event should 
be recorded separately. AEs and/or laboratory abnormalities shall be reported to the Sponsor

 according to the reporting requirements and within the time periods specified in the protocol. 
All A Es will  be followed up until resolved or as clinically required.  
Specific information about secondary malignancies such as leukaemia , MDS  and aplastic 
anaemia  or any other malignancy, will be collected up to 5  years after study medication 
administration or relapse of disease, including information about treatment given to the patient 
due to NHL. See also paragraph on Adverse Events of Special Interest in Sectio n 13.1.7 . 
Death  is not defined as an AE  but as an outcome of an AE. It is important that the event leading 
to the death is reported. If death is the outcome of an AE, it will be reported as such for ( i) all 
AEs regardless of relationship to study treatment up to 12 weeks after the last administration of 
study treatment  and (ii) AESI, and study treatment related AEs and SAEs with onset >12 weeks 
after the last administration of study treatment .       
Progression of disease :  
• Part A:  Progression of disease will be re ported as an AE until Week  12. There after 
progression of disease will be recorded in the eCRF and still used as an efficacy 
endpoint. It will be the SRC  who will decide if a fatal outcome of disease progression 
should be considered as an expected AE. This will depend on the information received 
and medical consideration.  
• Part B  and C: Disease p rogression is not reported as an AE if it is clearly consiste nt 
with the suspected progression as determined by the protocol. Hospitalisation due solely 
to disease progression should NOT be reported as a SAE. Any associated symptoms may 
be reported as adverse events if there is any uncertainty about the symptom bein g 
exclusively due to disease progression, or if it does not fit the expected pattern of 
progression of the disease.  
AEs due to rituximab injection : Rituximab in fusion is given once prior to Betalutin injection, 
and AEs due to rituximab could happen. The expected AEs with rituximab are described in the 
package insert for rituximab. This should be taken into consideration when reporting an AE.  
AEs may be reported spontaneously by the patient or elicited through open (nonleading) 
questioning during each visit to the study centre  and at the end of the A E follow-up.  
As far as possible , all AEs must be described by their duration (start and stop date ), severity 
(graded according to the CTCAE  Version  4.0, or later as applicable ), relationship to treatment 
(unrelated, possible, probable) , according to the need of other specific therapy , and outcome . 
All information will be recorded in the AE eCRF page.  
A baseline recording of any symptoms of illness will be performed prior to start of study 
treatment. Only symptoms that increase in severity throughout the treatment period or new 
symptoms of illness will be recorded as A Es in the e CRF.  
13.3 Reporting of Serious Adverse Events   
13.3.1  Investigator’s Responsibilities  
The investigator shall report all SAEs, regardless of suspected causality, immediately (within

 24 hours of the investigator becoming aware of the event) to the Sponsor or assigned designee . 
The immedia te report shall be followed by detailed written report(s).  
SAEs will be reported in the following time periods: 
• SAEs will be collected from signing informed consent to ensure that any protocol -related 
SAEs are collected.  
• Up to 12 weeks  after the last admi nistration  of study treatment, whether or not 
considered related to IMP.  
• At any time after 12 weeks after the last administration of study treatment when it comes 
to the investigator’s attention and is judged to be related to the patient’s participation in  
the study or related to IMP. 
Any SAEs experienced after this 12 week period should only be reported to  the Sponsor or 
assigned designee if the investigator suspects a causal relationship to the study treatment, or if 
it is an AESI (see Section  13.1.7 ). Recurrent episodes, complications or progression of the 
initial SAE must be reported a s follow -up to the original episode within 24 hours of the 
investigator receiving the follow -up information. An SAE occurring at a different time interval 
or otherwise  considered completely unrelated to a previously reported one should be reported 
separately as a new event.  
All SAEs must be reported to Sponsor or assigned designee as follows:  
1. Immediately (within 24 hours of discovery of the event) report the event by email, 
telephone or fax. 
2. Complete the SAE report form and send within 3 working days of the discovery of the 
event.  
3. Follow- up the SAE until resolved or as clinically required, all follow -up evaluations must 
be reported . 
4. Record the SAE in the patient eCRFs provided. 
5. Document the SAE in the hospital records. 
It is important to send “as complete as possible” a report within the timelines. Incomplete 
information must NOT d elay reporting of SAEs. Additional information must be reported once 
it is available; in follow -up reports using the same SAE forms, but marked as a follow -up report. 
In Part A, SAEs/SUSARs will be rev iewed by both the SRC and the Sponsor.   
Where applicab le as per local requirements, the investigator will inform the Ethics Committee 
(EC)/Institutional Review Board ( IRB) of the SAE.  For reporting death of a patient, the 
investigator shall supply the Sponsor and the EC with any additional information request ed.

 13.3.2  Sponsor’s Responsibilities  
The Sponsor or assigned designe e is responsible for the ongoing safety evaluation of the IMP. 
The Sponsor or assigned designee is responsible for the prompt notification to all concerned 
investigators, the ECs/IRBs and Competent Authorities where Betalutin studies are ongoing, 
of all th e relevant safety information, including findings that affect the health of the patients, 
impact on the conduct of the study or alter the Competent Authority’s authori sation to continue 
the study in accordance with Directive 2001/20/EC. 
The Sponsor has to keep detailed records of all AEs reported to him by the investigators and to 
perform an evaluation with respect to seriousness, causality and e xpectedness. These records 
shall be submitted to the Competent Authorities in the countries where the clinical study is 
being conducted, if they so request.  
Each individual AE should be evaluated by the Sponsor  or assigned designee, with regard to 
its ser iousness and causal relationship to the IMP and/or concomitant therapy. The Sponsor 
will not overrule the causality assessment given by the investigator. If the Sponsor disagrees 
with the investigator’s causality assessment, both the opinion of the investigator and the 
Sponsor will be provided with the report. 
The Sponsor will assess whether or not the AE is unexpected.  
The Sponsor or assigned designee will inform all investigators of relevant information about 
SUSAR s.  
13.4 Other Safety Parameters Including Demographics   
13.4.1  Diagnosis and M edical History  
A histological diagnosis of relapsed incurable NHL  of following subtypes; follicular 
grade I- IIIA, marginal zone, small lymphocytic, lymphoplasmacytic, or mantle cell is 
established by the pathologist at the study site  for Part A  and Part C  of the study OR follicular 
grade I -IIIA for P art B . The proficiency of anti-CD37 -antibodies at detecting  have been tested 
against FL samples and shown to be suitable for identifying CD37 positive cells.  
In Part A  of the study, the  CD37 detection could be set up locally or the study centres  could 
send slides to Radiumhospitalet, Oslo, Norway  for centrali sed reading. If the staining has been 
verified using samples of FL, the pathology slides  and tissue samples  must be stored after 
reading, and may at a later stage be requested to be sent to Radiumhospitalet, Oslo, Norway for 
centrali sed reading. 
The anti -CD37 -antibodies have been tested against FL samples and shown to be suitable for 
identifying CD37 positive cells. 
In Part A  of the study, the study centres sent slides to Radiumhospitalet, Oslo, Norway for 
centralised reading.  
For patients enrolling in Part B  and Part C , tumour tissue  will be obtained to assess CD37 
expression by the tumour cells. The tumour tissue samples wi ll be sent to an accredited 
laboratory in the European Union ( EU) or US for CD37 testing.  The results of the analysis are 
not necessary for inclusion in the study  (with the exception of patients entering in Germany) , 
but will be captured in the eCRF.

 A summary of the patient’s relevant medical history prior to study inclusion should be recorded 
on the appropriate e CRF page.  
CT with contrast agent will be performed at baseline for identifying the tumour lesions. MRI 
scans for patients with contrast allergy are acceptable.  
A bone  marrow biopsy will be taken from a site not previously irradiated to ensure that there 
are less than 25% tumour cells (this may be taken up to 8 weeks before the rituximab 
administration) .  
13.4.2  Physical Examination 
Physic al examination of the lymph nodes is assessed and an abbreviated physical examination 
consisting of  the heart,  lungs, and other physical findings will be done at each hospital visit 
where the patient meets with the treating physician.   
Any physical examination finding that is classified by the investigator as a clinically significant 
change (worsening compared to previous examination) will be considered as an AE /SAE , 
documented on the patient’s eCRF, and followed until the outcome is known.  Clinical 
assessments of lymph nodes are included in the physical examination at all visits , at time points 
given in Schedule of assessments Table  6-5, Table  6-7 and Table  6-8. 
The investigator will also assess the WHO/ECOG performance status at time points given in 
Schedule of assessments tables in  Section 6.3 .

Performance status response and progression will be e valuated as : 
• Improvement or worsening  by 1-point or more on the WHO scale from the baseline 
value. 
13.4.3  Vital Signs  
Vital signs ( systolic/diastolic blood pressure, heart rate , and body temperature) will be 
measured as described in the Schedule of Assessments , Section  6.3. Additional vital sign s 
assessments will be done under the investigator’s judgment.  
Measurement of blood pressure will be done on the arm contralateral to the site of IMP 
administration.

 Both “new” and “worsening” vital sign abnormalities are anticipated in patients over the course 
of a clinical study. A “new” abnormality is defined as one that occurs when a patient’s normal 
baseline vital signs develop clinically significant values (“nota ble”) post- baseline. A 
“worsening” abnormality is defined as one that occurs when a patient’s “notable” baseline vital 
signs become worse post-baseline by 25%. 
Notable vital signs results should be interpreted in conjunction with the clinical situation of the 
patient. Once AE /SAE  notification is decided upon, the investigator is required to follow the 
procedure described for AE notification and document the clinically notable abnormality on 
the AE eCRF page. Any notable abnormal vital signs finding or related AE must be followed 
until outcome is known.  
13.4.4  12-lead Electrocardiogram   
A standard 12 -lead ECG will be performed as per Schedule of Assessment s (Table  6-5 and 
Table  6-8). Results will be recorded as normal or abnormal; abnormal findings will be 
described in the eCRF. The ECG will be evaluated by the investigator Additional vital signs 
assessments will be done under the investigator’s judgment. 
A copy of the ECG page, signed, dated and interpreted  should be stored in the patient file.

Reference ranges from the laboratory will be provided to the Sponsor. If during the study, 
ranges should be changed, the investigator is requested to provide  updated laboratory normal 
values.  
The investigator will interpret all clinical laboratory test results outside the reference range .  
Laboratory values outside reference range recorded in the CTCAE, will be graded 1 to 4 
according to the CTCAE criteria. The laboratory CTCAE grade will be derived  
programmatically for the purpose of reporting in the Clinical Study Report.  
Investigators will assess a bnormal laboratory values or test results occurring after informed 
consent. Abnormal laboratory results constitute AEs only i f they : 
• induce clinical signs or symptoms, or 
• are considered clinically significant, or 
• require therapy (e.g. transfusion) or  
• require changes in medications.  
Laboratory  abnormalities that meet the criteria for AE should be followed until they have 
returned to normal. Lab oratory  abnormalities not requiring clinical intervention or further 
investigation will be captured as part of overall laboratory monitoring, and should not be 
reported as AEs. 
The laboratory values might be an SAE if meeting any of  the seriousness criteria defined in 
Section  13.1.3 . During the follow -up period only changes in laboratory values judged to be 
related to IMP will be reported  as AEs. 
Once AE notification is decided upon, investigators  are re quired to follow the procedure 
described for AE notification and document the notable laboratory results on the AE eCRF 
page. Any notable laboratory abnormality or related AE must be followed until the outcome is 
known.  
The signed and interpreted laboratory results will be kept together with the patient ’s eCRF as 
supplemental pages at the study centre . 
13.4.6  Immunogenicity A ssessment  
Immunogenicity assessment to monitor the potential development of an anti -drug antibody 
(ADA) response will be performed before the lilotomab administration and at subsequent 
timepoints (see Section  13.4.6.2 ). 
13.4.6.1  Part A, Phase I and IIa 
In Part A, p atients  will be monitored locally for the development of ADA after treatment up to 
12 months. The sampling for these patients will be at the following time points at screening

 visit, and after Betalutin administration: 1,  3, 6, and 12 months (see Table  6-5 and Table  6-7). 
The exact date point when the sample is taken needs to be recorded in the eCRF. 
A volume of approximately 9 mL of peripheral blood will be collected in a serum tube at patient 
screening.  The serum will be collected at each study centre  and used to assess the presence of 
pre-existing ADA ( HAMA ) locally using the Milenia® QuickLine HAMA test (Milenia 
Biotec), except for patients screened at the Radium Hospital ( Oslo, Norway). In this specif ic 
case, the IFMA test  will be used . When a positive result is obtained with the Milenia QuickLine 
HAMA test, a serum sample could be sent to the Radium Hospital for confirmation  of the 
positive result with the IFMA test . Centres in Norway and Sweden may also ship serum samples 
to the Radium Hospital for further ADA testing, when feasible.  
13.4.6.2  Part B FL Phase I Ib and Part C Pharmacokinetic Cohort phase IIa 
All patients included in Part B and Part C  of the LYMRIT 37 -01 study will be monitored for 
the development of ADA after treatment up to 12 months.  
The blood sampling for these patients will be at the following time points :  
• before lilotomab dose (Day-1 /0, baseline) , and  
• after Betalutin administration: 7 days, and 1, 3, 6, and 12 months (see Table  6-8).  
• Additional sampling will be required if a test is found  ADA positive at 12 months . 
Persistence of the ADA response will then be assessed every 6 months until the ADA 
test is negative [46].  
The exact time point when the sample is taken need to be recorded in the eCRF. 
A volume of approximately 6 mL of peripheral blood will be collected by venipuncture in a 
dedicated serum tube at each time point (see above) to monitor the development of an ADA 
response post lilotomab/Betalutin treatment. Serum samples will be isolated, aliquoted and

At the follow-up visits the investigator will observe for indications  of potential late -toxicity, 
such as secondary  cancers , acute myelogenous leukaemia , myelodysplastic syndrome, and 
aplastic anaemia . In addition, physical examination will be performed and blood samples for 
biochemistry and haematology taken.  Potential long -term toxicity (new onset AESIs, and study 
treatment -related AEs and SAEs only with onset >12 weeks after the last administration of 
study treatment) must be reported according to Section  13.2.

14 STATISTICAL METHODS AND PLANNED ANALYSES   
14.1 Statistical Hypotheses and Tests  
14.1.1  Sample Size Calculation – Part A  (phase I  and phase IIa) 
The phase I design is a “3+3” design, where MTD is defined as highest dose where ≤1 of 
6 patients experience DLT. The number of patients will depend on the number of dose levels 
explored and are expected to be  up to  approximately 40 patient s, depend ing on occurrence of 
DLT s. The patient will be substituted if the data are insufficient.  
For Arm 1: Due to the limited number of patients treated in phase I (six), an interim analysis 
of the safety and efficacy of lilotomab 40 mg/ Betalutin 15 MBq/kg was performed after 9 
additional patients had been treated in phase IIa (total: 15 patients).  
The following guide was used for the Arm 1 interim analysis, and the final decision was taken 
by the SRC:  
• If ≥4 DLT in 15 patients -> lower the dose  
• If ≤3 DLT in 15 patients -> continue on same dose (or see below)  
In addition, response rate will be evaluated for futility : 
• If ≥4 responses in 15 patients -> continue on same dose 
• If ≤3 responses in 15 patients -> stop for futility  (or see below)  
It will be open ed up for a combined evaluation:  
• If ≥4 DLT and ≥7 responses -> lower the dose 
• If ≤3 DLT and ≤ 10 responses - > increase the dose to 20 MBq /kg Betalutin based on the 
recommendation of the SRC  analysis of the observed toxicities.  
The decision to continue the dose was made by the SRC. Thirty more patients were planned in 
Part A, phase IIa for a total of 36 patients at that dose level.  
Following a review of the Arm 4 phase I patient safety data by the SRC, approximately 10 to 
15 additional patients will be enrolled into a Part A, phase II a expansion arm and be treated 
with 20 MBq/kg Betalutin and 100 mg/m2 lilotomab. 
14.1.2  Sample Size  and Statistical Hypotheses  – Part B (phase IIb)  Follicular 
Lymphoma  
14.1.2.1  Randomised Part B - Choice of RP2D  
Note - Part B of the study was initiated as a randomised, 2 -arm, open -label study to further 
differentiate the risk/benefit of 2 promising dose regimens of lilotomab and Betalutin.  (Protocol 
Version  11)   
In total, up to 130 patients (65 patients per candidate regimen)  with FL will be enrolled.  
Based on data available at time of Protocol Version  11, a difference of 27% in ORR is expected 
to emerge between the dose regimens with similar low toxicity profile s. The ORR’s assumed 
Investigational Product:

 for each group are: 69% for the 40 mg lilotomab+15 MBq/kg Betalutin arm, and 42% for the 
100 mg/m2 lilotomab+20 MBq/kg Betalutin arm.  
A sample size of 65 patients per arm should be sufficient to detect this difference, using a two -
sided s ignificance level 0.05 with at least 80% statistical power. Sample size estimation was 
performed using nQuery Advisor V7 (Statsol.com). The method was a 2 group continuity 
corrected chi -square test for equal proportions (55). 
14.1.2.2  Interim Analysis – Part B  Randomised  
Note - The interim analysis was introduced in Protocol Version 11 and amended in protocol 
Version 13 . 
Once approximately 50 patients have been treated (approximately 25 per dose regimen), an 
interim analysis  will be performed on the ORR based on IRC assessment for the study. There 
is no statistical test of hypothesis in the interim analysis.  
In line with its charter, the SRC will review the results of the interim analysis and provid e a 
recommendation to the Sponsor to continue or terminate treatment arms or to perform other 
modifications based on the totality of safety, efficacy, and other available data 
(e.g. immunogenicity data). The final decision lies with the sponsor. 
The SRC  will take into account the following guidelines: if ORR  ≥40% in each treatment 
regimen, the study may complete its targeted enrolment of up to 130 patients, around 65 per 
arm. If ORR < 40% in either regimen then the regimen with ORR <40% may be terminated. I f 
both regimens have ORR <40%, the study may be terminated for futility or modified. There 
regimen(s) with ORR  ≥40% will proceed to enrol the remaining patients, up to 130 total.  
To facilitate decision to keep or drop treatment arms based on ORR rates, the  boundary of 40% 
ORR is non-binding and for guidance only. 
The primary efficacy endpoint is overall tumour response rate according to the IRC. Scans will 
be performed at baseline, 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48 and 60 months after Betalutin injection for 
all patients to assess tumour response (see Section 14.1.7 ).  
Response rates will be presented as a percentage of the Intent- to-Treat ( ITT) population wi th 
the exact 95% confidence interval (Clopper- Pearson).  
14.1.2.3  Part B – Population treated with  “40/15” R egimen  
Note - At the interim analysis, the SRC decided to discontinue the “100/20” treatment regimen, 
and continue with further recruitment in the “40/15” treatment regimen only. 
A total of 87 patients, including the those from the  interim analysis, will be recruited and treated 
with the “40/15” regimen.  
With 87 patients, there will be more than 90% power to detect a difference of 18% in response 
rates using a two -sided exact test with a target significance level of 0.05, assuming the response 
rate under the null hypothesis is 30% and the response rate under the alternative hypothesis is 
48%. If there are at l east 36 responders in 87 patients, then there will be at least 97.5% chance 
that the true response rate will be at least 30%.  
Moreover, with 87 patients, there will also be more than 90% power to detect a difference in 
complete response rate of 8% under the null hypothesis v ersus 20% under the alternative 
hypothesis.

 14.1.3   Part C (phase IIa) Pharmacokinetic Cohort  
At least 10 patients ( up to a maximum of 2 0 patients , all treated with the “40/15” treatment 
regimen ) will be entered into Part C. This number is based on feasibility and the minimum 
number of patients evaluable  for pharmacokinetic  analyses (profiles and pharmacokinetic 
parameter summaries ). 
For the purpose of pharmacokinetic parameter evaluation and analysis, p atients with  FL entered 
into Part B who have also provided  PK samples, and who are treated with “40/15” treatment 
regimen may  be combined with patients entered into Part C.  
14.1.4  Analysis Populations 
Definition of populations  
The following 4 populations are defined: 
• Safety:  All patients who received Betalutin or lilotomab  or rituximab . 
• Intent- to-treat (ITT):  All patients who received Betalutin . 
• Per Protocol (PP): The Per Protocol population will consist of a subset of patients from 
the ITT population who hav e an adequate tumour assessment at baseline, a follow -up 
tumo ur assessment ≥12 weeks after starting treatment (unless disease progression is 
observed before that time), and no major protocol violations. 
• Pharmacokinetic  (PK) : The PK Population will be defined as all subjects who received 
at least a dose of Betalutin and have evaluable PK data, and a complete or agreed sparse 
scheduled post -dose PK measurements without protocol deviations, violations , or events 
thought to signif icantly affect the PK of the drug .  
Part A  (phase I and phase IIa)  
The primary efficacy analy sis population is PP because in early phase study we are interested 
in demonstrating in principle whether the treatment is efficacious.  Efficacy endpoints will als o 
be evaluated in the ITT population.  
Part B  (FL Phase IIb)  
The primary efficacy analyses will be conducted on the ITT population. 
Part C (P harmacokinetic  Cohort, phase IIa)  
The primary pharmacokinetic analys es will be conducted on the PK population. 
14.1.5  Statistical Methods  
Results from Part A (Phase I and Phase IIa) , Part B and Part C will be summari sed separately 
due to differences in study design, dose regimens and patient populations. However , analyses 
in specific populations and for specific dose regimens may be performed in the overall study 
population.   
The results from this study will be presented mostly using descriptive statistical methods.  
Details of planned analyses for Parts A, B and C will be provided in separate statistical analysis 
plans.

 All statistical programming and analyses will be performed using SAS® software . 
Data will generally be presented by time of measurement. In general, continuous variables will 
be described using standard summary statistics such as number of observations, mean val ue, 
standard deviation, minimum  value,  maximum value, median, and first and third  quartiles. 
Categorical variables will be summari sed in frequency tables as count and percentages.  
All individual data collected in the eCRF  will be presented in data listings. Patient s screened 
but not included in the study will not be presented in any tables or listings.  
Prior to database lock and analysis of the final study data, a detailed Statistical Analysis Plan 
(SAP) will be prepared and approved, describing all the analyses to be performed. The SAP 
will document any changes to the analyses described in this protocol. 
14.1.6  Analysis of D emographic and Pre-treatment Characteristics  
Demographic data and other pre-treatment characteristics (including medical and disease 
history) will be summari sed by dosing cohort (Part A) or dosing regimen (Part B) or Part C . 
For all demographic and baseline characteristics,  the analysis population will be the safety 
popu lation .  
Administration of the IMP will be listed provided in listings, by cohort and patient.   
14.1.7  Analysis of E fficacy Data 
Tumour response will be reported as follows in individual patients: 
• CR 
• PR 
• SD 
• PD 
• NE 
In Part A and Part C: Response rate will be presen ted as a point estimate of the proportion of 
responders along with the 95 % exact confidence interval of response rate. 
In Part B  randomis ed period : The ORR will be compared between dosing regimens using the 
Fisher’s Exact test , and the difference in response rates and the corresponding 95% exact CI 
will be presented . ORR estimates and 95% exact CI  for each dosing regimen  will also be 
presented.  
In Part B Single -arm 40/15 part: – The primary efficacy analysis on ORR (based on 
independent assessment) will be performed by testing whether the ORR is less than or equal to 
30% against the alternative hypothesis that ORR is greater than 20% at overall two -sided 5% 
level of significance, i.e., 
H0: p = 0.3 vs. Ha: p ≠ 0.3  
In addition, the secondary efficacy analysis on  CRR (based on independent assessment) will be 
performed by testing whether the CRR is less than or equal to 8% against the alternative 
hypothesis that ORR is greater than 8% at overall two -sided 5% level of significance, i.e.,

Responders are defined as having CR and PR according to definition in Section 12.3. 
Time to event endpoints will be analysed using standard Kaplan -Meier techniques. The 
estimate of the median survival curve will be calculated along with the associated 95% 
confidence intervals (when applicable). The efficacy endpoints are: 
Overall Response Rate (ORR)  
ORR, defined as the proportion of patients who achieve a CR or PR assessed with the use of 
standard criteria for lymphoma (1). The ORR will be assessed at 3  months image evaluation.  
Best ORR  will also be evaluated, taking the best response  
achieved independent of time point for image evaluation.  
Complete Response Rate (CRR)  
CRR, defined as the proportion of patients who achieve a CR assessed with the use of standard 
criteria for lymphoma (1). The CRR will be calculated based on complete  responses achieved 
at any timepoint . 
Progression -free survival  (PFS) 
PFS is defined as the interval from Betalutin administration  and date of: 
• Relapse (new or enlarged lesions after CR).  
• Progression (new or enlarged lesions after PR or SD). 
• Death from any cause.  
If none of the above events are observed, PFS will be censored at the date of the last adequate 
tumour assessment  
Duration of response  (DoR) 
DoR is the time from when criteria for response (CR or PR) is first met to the time of relapse 
or progression.  Patients who have not relapsed/progressed will be censored at the last adequate 
tumour assessment. 
Duration of Complete Response (DoCR) 
DoCR  is the time from when the complete response  is first observed  to the ti me of relapse. 
Patients who have not relapsed will be censored at the last adequate tumour assessment.  
Overall survival (OS)  
OS is defined as the time from administration of Betalutin  to the date of death from any cause. 
Patients still alive or lost to follow -up are censored at the last date they were known to be alive. 
Patients still alive are censored at the last known date alive . 
14.1.8  Biodistribution  and Pharmacokinetic s 
These data, whic h are obtained from a subset of patients in Part A and B, and from all patients 
in Part C , as described in Section  10, will be listed by patient by time point .

 pharmacokinetics ) vs. time curv es presented. Pharmacokinetic results will also be summari sed 
by cohort (Part A) or dosing regimen (Part B  and Par t C). Pharmacokinetic parameters  will be 
determined using non -compartments analyses  including activity -corrected  area under the blood 
radioactivity vs. time curve, dose- corrected area under the serum concentration vs. time curve 
clearance, apparent volume of distribution and half- life. 
14.1.9  Analysis of P harmacokinetic Data 
The study population displays will be based on the PK population, unless otherwise specified.  
Betalutin pharmacokinetic parameters to be determined include: Maximum total radioactivity 
in blood (C max), time to reach maximum blood concentration (t max), area under the total 
radioactivity -time curve (AUC 0-∞, AUC 0-last), mean residence time (MRT), terminal elimination 
half-life (t 1/2, z), biological half -life (Tb), effective half -life (te) total body clearance (CL), renal 
clearance (CL R), and volume of distribution (V d). Activity -adjusted C max and AUC will a lso be 
calculated using the actual activity injected (Bq).  
Total lilotomab antibodies pharmacokinetic parameters to be determined include: Maximum 
total drug concentration in serum (C max), time to reach maximum drug concentration (t max), area 
under the drug concentration -time curve (AUC 0-∞, AUC 0-last), mean residence time (MRT), 
terminal elimination half -life (t 1/2, z), total body clearance (CL), renal clearance (CL R), and 
volume of distribution (V d). Dose -adjusted C max and AUC will also be calculated using the 
actual dose of antibody injected (mg) to investigate the effect of body size on the 
pharmacokinetics of lilotomab.  
Pharmacokinetic analysis will be carried out using actual sampling times. Data will be tabulated 
by patient by time point. Descriptive statistics (geometric mean, standard deviation, minimum, 
median, and maximum) and coefficient of variation (%) will be calculated for pharmacokinetic 
parameters. For each of the parameters, summary statistics will be c alculated and tabulated by 
arm and dose group. Output will be presented separately for Part A and Part B , whilst data 
obtained from Part B patients (treated with the “40/15” regimen) may be combined with data 
obtained from Part C patients.  Additional anal ysis such as pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic 
modelling will be considered pending the size of the PK population. 
14.1.10  Analysis of S afety Data 
Standard safety listings  will be provided for treatment exposure, patient disposition, AEs, AEs  
leading to discontinuation , SAEs , laboratory safety data (serum chemistry and haematology ), 
vital signs, 12-lead ECG, physical examination, ECOG performance status , and long- term 
toxicity. i.e. all safety parameters mention in Section 13.  
The incidence of AEs will be tabulated and reviewed for potenti al significanc e and clinical 
importance. The number of patient s reporting AEs, and the number of AEs reported will be 
presented. AEs will be coded using MedDRA  and graded according to CTCAE . The events 
will be tabulated by system organ class , preferred term , CTCAE gradi ng, severity , and 
relationship to study medication. Start of AE after study medication injection and duration of 
AEs will also be tabulated. SAEs will also be presented in separate tabulations. 
For laboratory data, the number of abnormal and clinically significant observations will be 
listed by patient and by time of measurement. The laboratory values will also be graded 
according to toxicity graded as CTCAE.  All patients who recei ve any amount of the study

14.1.11  Analysis of Immunogenicity Data  
The study population displays will be based on the Safety population, unless otherwise 
specified.  
Immunogenicity analysis will be carried out using nominal or actual sam pling times. Data will 
be tabulated by patient by time point. Descriptive statistics (geometric mean, standard deviation, 
minimum, median, and maximum) and coefficient of variation (%) will be calculated for each 
relevant immunogenicity parameters. For eac h of the parameters, summary tables and figures 
will be generated by arm and dose group. Output will be presented separately for Part A , Part B  
and Part C . 
Immunogenicity parameters to be determined include: 
• Incidence, titre, timing of onset and duration of antibody responses for each type of 
antibody assay used (e.g. IgG by ELISA, neutralisation ) 
• Relationship of antibody formation to underlying disease, concomitant medication, dose, 
duration, regimen and formulation when relevant 
• Analyse s of potential clinically relevant correlates of immunogenicity, for example, to 
determine the extent to which the presence of antibodies of a particular type or titer 
appears to correlate with alterations of pharmacokinetics , changes in 
pharmacodynamics ), loss of efficacy, loss of adverse event profile or development of 
adverse events. Events that might be immunologically mediated (e.g. serum sickness) 
and events that might result from binding of cross -reactive endogenous substances by 
antibodies to the administered drug will be explored.  
14.1.12  Handling of D rop-outs and/or M issing Data 
No missing data will be imputed .  
14.1.13  Sub-group A nalysis  
No sub -group analyses are planned. However, sub -groups may be identified on a data -driven

14.2 Analys is for Patients in Part B with FL  
The statistical analysis for Part B (in relation to the current single -arm design) will be 
performed at the following timepoints after last patient has been dosed with Betalutin: 
• After all patients have had at least one post -treatment tu mour assessment : This will 
consist of the baseline data, efficacy data on ORR, CRR and preliminary assessment on 
the longer -term efficacy outcomes (DoR, DoCR), and selected safety data.  No change 
to the trial conduct nor the statistical analysis plan is en visaged.  
• 9 months post Betalutin administration (6 -month follow  up of response for all patients 
with PR or CR) : This will consist of the baseline data, efficacy data on ORR, CRR and 
preliminary assessment on the longer -term efficacy outcomes (DoR, DoCR, PFS, OS), 
and all safety data  accumulated to this point.

Pharmacokinetics, immunogenicity and biomarker assessments may be analyzed subsequently 
and reported in individual analytical reports as addendum to the Clinical Study Report(s). 
Exploratory biomarkers analysis will be published if relevant.  
14.3 Timing of Analysis in Part C (P harmacokinetic  Cohort)  
Pharmacokinetic parameters will be analy zed and summarized at the same time as the final 
analysis of patients in Part B ( Section 14.2). Pharmacokinetic  data from p atients with FL 
entered to Part B (and who have also provided pharmacokinetic  samples ) may be combined

of their rights, they will be asked t o contact their study doctor or Data Prote ction Officer 
at the study site . If they are not happy with the response they receive, the patient  may 
make a complaint to their  local data protection authority. 
15.2 Electronic Case Report Forms  
All data, except from l aboratory assays, which should be reported in the study report, will be 
recorded in the eCRF. Only high -level conclusions based on imaging or biodistribution result s 
will be recorded in the eCRF. Source data and intermediate calculations will be stored at the 
study centre . 
eCRFs will be used to capture study results and data. The study coordinator or other authori sed 
study personnel will transcribe data from source documents to the eCRFs . All eCRFs will be 
reviewed and source verified by the study monitor, . Once the eCRFs are complete and source -
verified, the investigator must electronically sign and date all required pages, verifying the 
accuracy of all data in the eCRF.  
Specific instruc tions for completing and submitting eCRF will be provided to the study centre . 
Because it is extremely important to have proper data collection in a timely manner, the 
investigator (s) or assigned designee shall complete the eCRFs continuously. The monitor will 
perform SDV  against the entries in the eCRF . When the monitor requests additional data or 
clarification of data for the eCRF, the request must be answered satisfactorily  
Any data recorded directly in the eCRF, for which no other written or electronic record will be 
maintained in the patient’s medical record, will be considered source data.   
15.3 Data Management  
Data management will be carried out as described in the Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) 
for clinical studies of the Sponsor’s subcontractor.  
All eCRFs will be entered electronically by study centre  staff into a validated database. Data

 entry will be SDV ed by a Sponsor representative. Comprehensive edit ch ecks will be used  to 
clean the data , and data queries will be generated and resolved by the investigator(s) or assigned 
designee . Patient data will be entered continuously. All changes to the data and the database 
structure will be recorded in an audit trail. 
All changes to the data and the database structure will be fully audit trailed either electronically 
within the clinical database or via a paper trail.  
Data queries will be generated at data  entry or if questions arise during the data validation or 
detected during a manual review (safety data). The queries are entere d into the eCRF and 
resolved  according to the ele ctronic data cap ture manual.  
AEs and SAEs will be handled in the same way as the other data reported in the eCRF. 
However, in addition the i nitial notification of S USARs  will be cod ed and medically  assess ed 
for reporting to authorities according to national regulatory requirements. Procedures for 
reconciliation of the clinical and safety databases will be provided in the Data Management 
Plan. Coding of AEs and medical history will be performed according to MedDRA and coding 
of concomitant medications will be performed according to WHO-Drug dictionary. 
A quality check of a random sample of the data will be performed to ensure that the consistency 
between the database and the eCRFs are at least on the pre -defined level described in SOPs of 
the Sponsor’s subcontractor and in the data validation plan.  
Data base lock  will be declared when all data have been entered, the data entry verified, the data 
validated and the database defined as clean by the Clinical Data Manager. After declaration of 
database lock  the data will be exported from the database to SAS-datasets and both the database 
and the SAS-dataset s will be locked and protected from changes. Subsequently then the 
inclusion of patients into the 4 analysis sets will be done in such a way that it is ensured that all 
rules h ave been applied equally on all patients. All statistical analyses will be performed on the 
locked SAS- datasets.  
15.4 Retention of Documents  
The following information must be retained for at least  15 years after the last approval of a 
marketing application in an International Council for  Harmonisation (ICH) region and until 
there are no pending or contemplated marketing applications in an ICH region; or at least 
15 years have elapsed since the formal discontinuation of clinical development of the IMP: 
source data, source documents  (includi ng scans/imaging data) , eCRFs, protocol and 
amendments, drug accountability forms, correspondence, patient identification list, informed 
consent forms, and any other essential documents.  
It is the responsibility of  the Sponsor to inform the investigator /institution as to when these 
documents no longer need to be retained according to ICH Good Clinical Practice ( GCP ) 
guidelines. T he eCRFs will be archived by the Sponsor for the lifetime of the product. No study 
docum ent should be destroyed without prior written agreement between the Sponsor and the 
investigator . In accordance with data protection legislation, the patient identification list should 
be destroyed when it is no longer needed. Should the investigator wish to assign the study 
records to another party or move them to another location, advance written notice should be 
given to the Sponsor.

 other documents or image material (including materials from all imaging modalities) submitted 
to the Sponsor, patients will not be identified by their names, but by an identification code 
(e.g. study centre  and patient  number). Personal medical information may be scrutini sed for the 
purpose of verifying data recorded in the eCRF. This may be done by the monitor(s), properly 
authoris ed persons on behalf of the Sponsor, the quality assurance unit, or regulatory authorities. 
Personal medical information will always be treated as confidential.  
16.3.5  Study Monitoring  
Monitoring is a Sponsor’s process for tracking a clinical study to ensure its scientific integrity, 
the data  quality, s afety , and well -being of the patients and compliance with the Declaration of 
Helsinki and other regulatory and/or Sponsor regulations. 
To ensure compliance with GCP, the monitor or Sponsor’s representative is responsible for 
ensuring that the study is conducted according to the protocol, and other written instructions. 
The monitor is the primary association between the Sponsor and the investigator . The main 
responsibilities of the monitor are to assure adherence to the protocol, accurate and complete 
data r ecording and reporting in the eCRFs, and that informed consent is obtained and recorded 
for all patients before their participation in the study.  
The monitor will contact and visit the investigator at regular intervals throughout the study. To 
assure the a ccuracy and completeness of the data recorded in the study, the monitor will be 
allowed to compare eCRFs with medical records and other relevant documentation during the 
on-site monitoring visits to ensure the completeness, consistency, and accuracy of the  data being 
recorded.  
The monitor is responsible for explaining the protocol and study -related procedures to all study 
staff, including the investigator . Additional information will be made available during the study 
when new staff become involved in the study and as otherwise agreed upon with either the 
investigator or the monitor. 
As part of the supervision of the study progress , other Sponsor personnel may, on request, 
accompany the monitor on visits to the study centre . The investigator and assisting st aff must 
agree to cooperate with the monitor to resolve any problems, errors, or possible 
misunderstandings concerning the findings detected in the course of these monitoring visits. 
16.3.6  Collection of IMP Dosing Errors  
A reportable IMP dosing error is defined as: 
• Betalutin : greater than +10% of the intended dose.  
• Lilotomab 40 mg: a dose <30  mg or a dose >70 mg  
The investigator must report an IMP dosing error to the Sponsor  or assigned designee within 
24 hours of treatment administration or within 24 hours of the error having been identified, 
following the process for SAE reporting in Section  13.3.

 16.3.7  Collection of Pregnancy Information 
16.3.7.1  Male Participants with Partners who become Pregnant 
The investigator will attempt to collect pregnancy information o r any male participant’s female 
partner who becomes pregnant while the male participant is in this study. This applies only to 
male participants who receive Betalutin.  
After obtaining the necessary signed informed consent from the pregnant female partner 
directly, the investigator will record pregnancy information on the appropriate form and submit 
it to the Sponsor or assigned designee  within 24 hours of learning of the partner’s pregnancy  
following the process for SAE reporting in Section  13.3. The female partner will  also be 
followed to determine the outcome of the pregnancy. Information on the status of the mother 
and child will be forwarded to the  sponsor. Generally, the follow -up will be 12 weeks following 
the estimated delivery date. Any termination of the pr egnancy will be reported regardless of 
foetal st atus (presence or absence of anomalies) or indication for the procedure.  
16.3.7.2  Female Participants who become Pregnant 
The investigator will collect pregnancy information on any female participant who becomes 
pregnant while participating in this study. Information will be recorded on the appropriate form 
and submitted to the sponsor within 24 hours of learning of a participant's pregnancy  following 
the process for SAE reporting in Section  13.3. The participant will be followed to determine 
the outcome of the pregnancy. The investigator will collect follow -up information on the 
participant a nd the neonate and the information will be forwarded to the sponsor.  Generally, 
follow- up will  be for 12 weeks beyond the estimated delivery date. Any termination of  
pregnancy will be reported, regardless of f oetal status (presence or absence of anomalies) or 
indication for the procedure. 
While pregnancy itself is not considered to be an AE or SAE, any pregnancy complication or 
elective termination of a pregnancy will be reported as an AE or SAE. A spontaneous abortion 
is always considered to be an SAE and will be reported as such. Any post -study pregnancy 
related SAE considered reasonably related to the study treatment by the investigator will be 
reported to the sponsor. While the investigator is not obligated to actively seek this information 
in former study participants, he or she may learn of an SAE through spontaneous reporting.  
Any female participant who becomes pregnant while participating in the study will continue to 
be followed during the course of her pregnancy. 
16.4 Safety R eview Committee (SRC)   
A SRC will periodically review and monitor the safety of patients in this study . The SRC  will 
consist of 3 to 4 relevant experts  (haematologists/oncologists) including the coordinating 
investigator for the study.  
The following safety data are examples of data that may be collected and eval uated for the 
SRC:  
• AEs.  
• Laboratory variables: serum chemistry and haematology  
• Immunogenicity

 • Vital signs (systolic/diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, and body temperature).  
• 12-lead ECG at baseline.  
• Physical examination, including WHO (ECOG) PS. 
• Long-t erm toxicity.  
In Part A, the SRC made recommendations for dose escalation and expansion according to 
Table 6-2.  
In Part B, the SRC reviewed the safety and efficacy data from the first 47 patients in the 
randomised section and recommended the future dose for development to be lilotomab 40 mg 
and Betalu tin 15 MBq/kg. 
The SRC will also review the safety data from the first 3 patients in each of the sub 
populations in Part B  (see Section  6.1) and make recommendations according to Table 6-4.  
In Part C, t he SRC may review emerging data at the same time as data from patients entered to 
Part B is reviewed.  
16.5 Independent Review Committee  (IRC)  - Parts B and C  
For Part B, an IRC will be established to provide an independent revie w of radiographic data 
and pertinent clinical data in order to provide expert interpretation of changes in tumour status. 
The IRC will include 1 independent board -certified radiologist and 1 independent 
board- certified haematologist/ oncologist, and will be managed by a clinical research 
organisation selected by Nordic Nanovector. The review of radiographic and clinical data by 
the IRC will be performed on an ongoing basis. Details  of the IRC’s processes /analysis methods 
will be described in a charter developed by the contracted imaging facility in con junction with 
Nordic Nanovector. 
From Part C, the IRC may review the radiological and pertinent clinical data from patients 
entered to this cohort.  
16.6 Audit and Inspection  
According to ICH Guidelines on GCP, the Sponsor may audit the study centre  to compare raw 
data, source data, and associated records with the interim or final report of the study to assure 
that data have been accurately reported. The investigator must accept that regulatory 
authorities, EC /IRB may conduct an inspection to verify compliance of the study with protocol, 
ICH GCP guidelines, and any applicable regulatory requirements. If the investigator is 
contacted with a request for an inspection, the investigator must inform the Sponsor 
immediately.  
16.7 Laboratory Accreditation  
Any clinical laboratory facility used for analysis of samples obtained under this protocol must 
demonstrate adequate licensure and accreditation. Reference ranges of test results must be 
provided to the Sponsor.

 Population  
Part B (FL phase IIb):  
Adult patients with relapsed FL who have received ≥2 prior anti -neoplastic or immunotherapy -based regimens, and 
are refractory to any pre vious anti -CD20 based regimen. Prior therapy must include an anti -CD20 therapy and an 
alkylating agent. Anti -CD20 refractory disease is defined as lack of a complete remission (CR) or partial remission 
(PR), or PD within 6 months of last dose of an anti -CD20 containing regimen . Prior exposure to idelalisib or 
other PI3K (Phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase) inhibitors is allowed. The eligibility criteria were widened under 
protocol Version 14 to allow enrolment of patients with a prior autologous stem cell transp lant (SCT)  are allowed 
to be entered  (if at least two years have elapsed since transplantation) and the patient has been without grade ≥1 
Graft vs Host Disease (GvHD) in the 8 weeks before the date of consent  and/or platelet count ≥100×109/L but 
<150×109/L  at study entry .  
 
Number of Patients Planned  
Part A (phase I and phase IIa): iNHL patients  
Up to 35 phase I patients will be enrolled . 
In phase IIa, 30 patients have been enrolled in Arm 1 and approximately 10 -15 patients will have  been enrolled in 
Arm 4.  
Part B (FL phase IIb):  
Randomised section of Part B  
Up to 130 patients with FL were planned to be enrolled and randomised 1:1 (stratified for double -refractory 
patients, where double -refractory is defined as refractory to both an anti -CD20 therapy and an alkylating agent 
therapy – see Section 9.1.7.2 for full definition) to receive dose “40/15” or dose “100/20” until the selection of 
one of the 2 regimens for further assessment in clinical development.  
Assessment of dose selected for further development  
Following the interim analysis and selection of the “40/15” regimen for future development, patient 
enrolment will be completed when 87 patients have received this regimen (including patients treated with 
the “40/15” regimen in the randomised section).  
All patients enrolled after the IA will receive “40/15”.  
Note: the Betalutin dose will be lower for patients entered with prior autologous  SCT and/or platelets <150x109/L) 
as follows :  
• Patients with a prior auto -SCT and who have platelets ≥150x109/L will receive Betalutin at the reduced 
dose of 12.5 MBq/kg.   
• Patients with a prior auto -SCT and who have platelets <150x109/L will receive Betalutin at the reduced 
dose of 10 MBq/kg  
• Patients without a prior SCT, but who have the lower platelet threshold (100 to <150 x 109/L) will receive 
Betalutin at the reduced dose of 12.5 MBq/kg  
Part C (phase IIa Pharmacokinetic Cohort): iNHL pati ents 
At least 10 patients (up to a maximum of 20 patients) from selected sites willing and able to collect 
pharmacokinetic samples.  
 
Study Evaluation  
Pharmacokinetics is mandatory for all patients enrolled in Part C.  
 
Statistical Methods and Planned Analysis:  
Part B (FL phase IIb)  
Comparison of “40/15” and “100/20” regimens  
The study is a randomised, 2 -arm, open -label study to further differentiate the  risk/benefit of 2 promising candidate  
dose regimens of lilotomab and Betalutin in patients with relapsed non -Hodgkin B -cell FL.   
Once approximately 50 patients have been treated (approximately 25 per dose regimen), an interim analysis will 
was be performed to evaluate the possibility of study modifications or continuation of both regimens.

 The intent -to-treat (ITT) population will consist of all patients who were randomised to one of the dose groups. 
The primary efficacy endpoint is ORR.  Scans will be performed at baseline, 3, 6, 9, 12, 18 and 24, 36, 48 and 60 
months after Betalutin injection for all patients to assess tumour response as follows:  
• CR 
• PR 
• No change/stable disease (SD)  
• PD 
• NE 
Response rates will be presented as percentage of patient s in the ITT population with the exact 95% confidence 
interval (Clopper -Pearson).  
Assessment of ORR in the “40/15” treatment regimen.  
A total of 87 patients, including the ones in the interim analysis, will be recruited and treated with the “40/15” 
regimen . 
The response rate under the null hypothesis is set at 30%, versus the response rate of 48% under the 
alternative hypothesis will be compared. A 2 -sided exact test with a significance level of 0.05 will be used to 
compare the observed response rate agains t the hypothesis. In addition, a complete response rate of 8% 
under the null hypothesis versus a complete response rate of 20% under the alternative hypothesis will also 
be tested.  
Descriptive and summary statistics will be calculated for each pharmacokinetic parameter. Further analyses 
may be conducted, as appropriate.  
Pharmacokinetic data and/or parameters from patients who received lilotomab 40mg and Betalutin 
15MBq/kg in Part B may be combined with data from Part C.  
 
Safety Review Committee:  
Part B:  
The SRC will periodically monitor the safety data.  
In line with its Charter, the Safety Review Committee reviewed the results of the interim analysis and provided a 
recommendation to the Sponsor to continue or terminate treatment arms or to perform other modifications. The 
recommendation was based on the totality of safety, efficacy, and other available data (e.g., immunogenicity data)  
based on the following guidelines:  
• If ORR ≥ 40% in each treatment regimen, the study may complete its targeted enro lment of up to 130 
patients (around 65 per arm)  
• If ORR < 40% in either regimen then the regimen with ORR <40% may be terminated.  
• If both regimens have ORR <40%, the study may be terminated for futility or modified. The 
regimen(s) with ORR ≥40% will procee d to enrol the remaining patients, up to 65 patients per 
regimen (including the patients in the interim analysis). The final decision lies with the Sponsor.  
To facilitate decision to keep or drop treatment arms based on ORR rates, the boundary of 40% ORR w as 
non-binding and for guidance only. Following the interim analysis, the SRC recommended to discontinue 
the “100/20” treatment regimen and continue with further recruitment in the “40/15” treatment regimen.  
For patients included with prior autologous - SCT and/or with platelet counts ≥100×109/L but <150×109/L, 
the SRC will evaluate the emerging safety data  (in particular, DLTs) from the  following  first 3 patients in each 
of the  following 3 sub-groups populations (see “Study Design” section)  
• If no DLT is obs erved, the dose of Betalutin may be escalated as follows:  
- to 15MBq/kg in the subpopulation with prior autologous SCT and platelet count ≥150×109/L.  
- to 15MBq/kg in the subpopulation without a prior autologous SCT, and platelet count 
≥100×109/L but <150×109/L.  
- to 12.5MBq/kg in the subpopulation with a prior autologous SCT and platelet count 
≥100×109/L but <150×109/L.  
• If 1 DLT is observed in a given subpopulation, a further 3 patients will be treated at the initial dose 
in this  subpopulation and the SRC will review the overall safety of the cohort prior to establishing the dose 
to be recommended.

 • If 2 DLTs are observed in any given subpopulation, the SRC may consider a dose reduction to “40/10” 
for the 2 subpopulations treated with “40/12.5” or may decide to close enrolment in the subpopulation. 
There will be no dose reduction of Betalutin below 10 MBq/kg.   
The SRC will evaluate the safety data from each set of 3 patients (either 3 or 3+3) in each subpopulation and 
may request a subsequent review of safety data.  
Part C:  
The SRC will periodically monitor the safety data in line with Part B review of safety data.

Section 4.2.3  Introduction; Part B – FL Phase IIb  
Following a review of the clinical safety, efficacy, dosimetry, and pharmacokinetic data from the treatment 
regimens used in Part A, the 2 candidate RP2D  dosing regimens from Arms  1 and 4 have  emerged as contenders

 for the recommended phase IIb dose  select ion of the RP2D for future clinical development . Therefore, a 
phase  IIb randomised arm sub-study  (hereafter referred to as Part B , or “PARADIGME” ) is being  was added to 
further delineate the risk:benefit profile of these candidate RP2D  treatment regimens i n a population of FL patients 
with ≥2 prior lines of therapy who are refractory to rituximab/anti -CD20 therapy.  
Following an interim analysis of 47 patients with FL, randomised to either 40  mg lilotomab and 15MBq/kg 
Betalutin (“40/15”), or 100mg/m2 liloto mab and 20MBq/kg Betalutin (“100/20”), the Safety Review Committee 
(SRC) recommended that the “40/15” dose be selected for subsequent patients entered to Part  B (which was 
formalised in Version 14 of the protocol) . 
Version 14 of the protocol also allowed for a relaxation of 2 selection criteria i.e. minimum accepted level of 
platelets at study entry and restriction on prior autologous stem cell transplantation (SCT)  (note: the 
Betalutin dose will be lower  for patients entered with a prior autologous SCT and/or platelets <150 ×109/L - see 
Section 4.2.4).  
 
Section 4.2.3  Introduction; Part B – Inclusion of Patients with a Prior Auto -SCT and Inclusion of Patients 
with Lower Platelet Threshold  
Patients with a prior autologous -SCT, for whom at least two y ears have elapsed since transplantation and who 
have been without grade ≥1 Graft vs Host Disease (GvHD) for at least 8 weeks  before the date of consent 
can be entered to Part B.  
Patients with a lower  platelet threshold  count ≥100 ×109/L but <150 ×109/L can be entered to Part B.  
Patients with both a prior autologous -SCT and /or a lower  platelet threshold  count ≥100 ×109/L but <150 ×109/L 
can be entered to Part B. The Betalutin dose is to be adapted for these patients.  
Patients will be divided into in 3 subpopulations and the first 3 patients in each  will receive the following 
doses:  
• Patients with a prior autologous -SCT and who have platelets  platelet count  ≥150 ×109/L will be followed 
for at least 6 weeks. These patients will receive Betalutin at the reduced dose of 12.5  MBq/kg with 
lilotomab 40 mg .   
• Patients with a prior autologous -SCT and who have platelets  platelet count  ≥100 ×109/L but  <150 ×109/L 
will be followed for at least 6 weeks. These patients will receive Betalutin at the reduced dose of 10  MBq/kg

• Patients without a prior autologous -SCT and who have the lower platelet threshold  platelet count 
≥100×109/L to but <150 ×109/L) will be followed for at least 6 weeks. These patients will receive Betalutin 
at the reduced dose of 12.5 MBq/kg with lilotomab 40  mg.  
Emerging safety data (in particular, dose limiting toxicities [DLT])  from the first 3 patients in each 
subpopulation will be reviewed by the SRC.  
The SRC may request a subsequent review of safety data ( see Section s 13 and  16.4). The SRC can either retain 
the current reduced dosing level, stop the recruitment of further pat ients with a prior auto -SCT and/or lower 
platelet count, or recommend a different dose  recommend the current reduced dosing level be maintained, 
a dose escalation (including escalation to Betalutin 15 MBq/kg with lilotomab 40 mg), an evaluation of an 
additional 3 patients, a dose -decrease, a different dose or to stop the recruitment of furth er patients with a 
prior autologous -SCT and/or lower platelet count.  
 
Section 4.2.3  Introduction; Part C - Inclusion of a Cohort Dedicated to Pharmacokinetic  Assessments  
Although pharmacokinetic assessment is an exploratory objective in Parts A and B, mea surement of total 
lilotomab antibodies was not included in Part A. Part C has therefore been introduced to further measure 
total lilotomab antibodies and to assess the total radioactivity of Betalutin in the blood to inform future 
development activities. Part C will be performed at selected sites that are able to perform blood sampling 
under the restrictions necessary due to the COVID -19 pandemic. Adult patients with relapsed indolent non -
Hodgkin B -cell lymphoma (iNHL) (according to the broader Part A entry  criteria) who are willing and able 
to provide pharmacokinetic samples will be enrolled to improve recruitment to this part of the study.  
All patients treated in Part C will be treated with the selected RP2D (“40/15” dose regimen).

 Section 4.4  Potential Benefits and Risks  
Patients included in Part s A and C  of this study are adults with histologically confirmed relapsed iNHL of any of 
the following subtypes; a) follicular grade I -IIIA, b) marginal zone, c)  small lymphocytic, d) lymphoplasmacytic, 
or e) man tle cell, considered to have experienced treatment failures from prior treatment regimens, including 
chemotherapy and immunotherapy treatment regimens.  
Following a protocol amendment (Protocol Version 7), the inclusion criterion for testing for CD37 positi ve cells 
was removed in order to remove the delay in treating patients while the biopsy testing was completed. This 
amendment was supported by  Dahle et al. showed  showing that CD37 was expressed in 216  out of 217 tumour 
biopsies from patients with B-cell lymphoma (37) . Furthermore they suggested  and suggestion  that the exception 
one case with no CD37 expression  (a patient with chronic lymphocyte leukaemia) may have been due to technical 
reasons associated with the assay.  
 
Section 4.5  Immunogenicity Risk Assessment of Lilotomab and Betalutin  
In Part A phase I and phase IIa and Part B (FL phase  IIb) and Part  C (Pharmacokinetic Cohort phase IIa),  
patients will therefore be tested for pre -existing HAMA, with a positive HAMA test being considered as an 
exclusion criterion ( see Section  7.1.1  and Section  7.2.1 respectively).  
Two additional immune responses were detected at 12 -month follow -up visits. No reported side -effects could be 
associated with the development of HAMA an immune response .  
In Part B and Part C , all patients will be tested screening for pre -existing HAMA will be performed using a 
commercially available test  prior to inclusion (such as the Milenia® Quickline HAMA kit or a HAMA -ELISA 
test commercially available) .  
An exploratory HAMA test to assess HAMA specificity vs. lilotomab (IFMA test) will also be performed at 
baseline for research purposes . using the IFMA test at a central laboratory. This IFMA test is mandatory for all 
patients. The decision whether a patient is eligible or not can be made on -site using a local test such as the Milenia® 
Quickline HAMA kit: or if not available, using the result from the central laboratory.   The IFMA test result may 
be used to verify a negative HAMA test at baselin e in cases, where HAMA testing using a commercially 
available test is not feasible.  
 
Section 4.7  Clinical Risk -benefit Summary

Section 4.8.6  Rationale for Part C and Selection of Patients with Indolent NHL in Part C   
New section added; subsequent sub sections are therefore renumbered.  
Initial pharmacokinetics data were collected in Part A in a broad population of iNHL. Collection of further 
pharmacokinetics data was included in Part B to better characterise the pharmacokinetics of Betalutin and 
total lilotomab antibodies. Pharmacokineti c sampling in Part B is to be performed at selected centres and 
only for patients consenting for pharmacokinetic sample collection. Pharmacokinetic sample collection is 
not feasible at all sites participating in study 37 -01 and ability to perform adequate sample collection is 
currently further limited due to restrictions related to COVID -19.  
As of January 2021, no Part B patient has consented to pharmacokinetic sample collection, which may have 
been partly due to patients’ reluctance to attend additional h ospital visits during the COVID -19 pandemic.  
Part C is added to specifically assess the pharmacokinetics of Betalutin and total lilotomab antibodies and 
is to be conducted at selected centres able and willing to perform adequate pharmacokinetic sample 
collection. In order to recruit enough patients in Part C, the population has been aligned with the population 
of Part A population, which is broader than Part B population and should allow for a sufficient amount of 
patients to be included at each participat ing site. Preliminary results from Part A have shown responses to 
study treatment in all populations of iNHL included in Part A (53), which allows their further inclusion in 
Part C.

Section 4 .8.7.1  Part B (FL phase II)  
Following commencement of Part B, an interim analysis of the emerging safety and efficacy data from the first 
47 patients was assessed by the SRC who recommended that  all patients enrolled after the interim analysis will 
receive  the “40/15” dosing regimen . The Sponsor followed the SRC recommendation and the study protocol 
was amended (Version  14) to continue with this single dose regimen only.

 Section 4.8.11  Rationale for Lower Betalutin Dose for Patients with Prior Autologous -SCT and/or Lower 
Platelet Level (Part B)  
Discussion with Professor Arne Kolstad and Professor Tim Illidge on  the SRC for this study , investigators  and 
lymphoma experts (amendment implemented in protocol Version 14)  lead to a recommendation that:  
• The new  revised inclusion criteria for platelets should not, in the first instance  allow for the acceptable 
platelet threshold to  be lowered too much on grounds that many of the DLTs in Part A were bleeding 
related.  
Elderly patients who have cycled through previous rounds of therapy  therapies  for FL and could potentially 
be treated on this protocol sometimes have platelets that are lower than would be considered ‘normal’ in 
younger, healthier reference populations. In order that this protocol includes a more representative 
population of FL patients there is a desire to include patients with platelets that are ≥100 ×109/L. This 
threshold represents a compromis e between the desire to be more inclusive and the potential threat from 
radiation induced thrombocytopenia which is a recognised and reproducible AE with this therapy <this 
paragraph has been moved from Section 6.2.2. without change>  
• Following discussions with investigators and lymphoma experts  the There was a  desire for inclusion of 
patients previously treated with stem cell transplantation was noted and  autologous -SCT . The prevalence 
of this approach as the mainstay of first line therapy in some countries was also considered. This was offset 
against the observation that patients with transplanted stem cells typically can demonstrate more limited 
bone marrow reserves (61).  One of the main effects of Betalutin administration, largely because of the 
attached radioactive lutetium is to compromised bone marrow. To retain sufficient activity to kill cancerous 
lymphoid tissue whilst avoiding excessive bone marrow toxicity a lower  dose of Betalutin was felt worthy 
of suggested for  initial assessment in this population . 
The choice of the lilotomab 40 mg and Betalutin 15 MBq/kg dose arm regimen  at the interim analysis points to a 
generally more efficacious and a more easily adhered t o regime n with acceptable safety profile. The supposition 
based on interim data is that the lower dose of cold lilotomab (in the “40/15” regimen as compared to the 
“100/20” regimen)  provides sufficient shielding of bone marrow without compromising the effi cacy in the tumour  
on tumour cells . The combination of a reduced dose of radioactivity for stem cell transplant patients and the choice 
of a regime n that is generally looking to be gentler on the bone marrow was considered an adequate compromise.  
A furthe r step to informally  assess patients progress after the first 3 patients in each of the sub -groups populations  
of prior autologous -SCT, lower platelet and both prior auto -SCT and lower platelets, who have been on study for 
at least 6 weeks adds an extra ele ment of supervision in considering the suitability of this new inclusion criterion. 
The consideration that future patients might be precluded from therapy by having previously received a mainstay 
approach like stem cell transplantation owing to the hitherto lack of experience dosing such patients and the desire 
to treat a representative population of NHL patients also factored into the rationale for this the amendment 
introduced in protocol Version 14.

Section 6.1  Description of Study Design; Synopsis  
Part B  
In Part B of the study, up to 130  patients with relapsed, rituximab/anti -CD20 refractory FL and platelet count 
≥150×109/L who have received ≥2 prior lines of therapy will be enrolled  were initially randomised  in a 1:1 
fashion  ratio  to compare the 2 candidate  RP2Ds: 40 mg lilotomab + 15 MBq/kg Betalutin versus 100 mg/m2 
lilotomab + 20 MBq/kg Betalutin) (65 per treatment regimen) until the selection of one of the 2 regimens for 
further assessment in clinical development.  
Following the Interim Analysis of efficacy and safety data from the first 47 patients, the SRC recommended that 
all patients receive lilotomab 40mg and Betalutin 15 MBq/kg, with the exception of the patients described below.  
An interi m analysis of efficacy and safety data was planned after approximately 50 patients (see 
Section  14.1.2.2). This was performed after the first 47 patient and the SRC recommended that the “40/15” 
regimen be selected for further development. Randomisation was  therefore stopped.   
Patient enrolment will be completed when a total of 87 patients have received the “40/15” regimen selected 
for further development (including patients in the randomised section).  
In Part B, patients with prior auto -SCT (more than 2 yea rs previously) and who have not experienced any ≥ grade 
1 GvHD in at least the 8 weeks or more prior to the date of consent may be included.  
The eligibility criteria for Part B, were also widened (under protocol Version 14), to allow enrollment of 
patient s with prior auto -SCT (that occurred more than 2 years prior to enrolment in the study) and/or with 
platelet counts ≥100 ×109/L but <150 ×109/L at study entry (see Section  4.8.5). The Betalutin dose is to be 
adapted for these patients.  
Further changes as identified for Section  4.2.3.  
Part C  
Open label phase IIa expansion cohort to enable the collection of samples for Betalutin pharmacokinetics 
and total lilotomab antibodies pharmacokinetics in at least 10 patients (up to a maximum of 20 patients)

 Definition of study periods:  
The study treatment period  is defined as from the first administration of rituximab pre -treatment until 12 weeks 
after Betalutin administration. All patients will be closely monitored during the study treatment period.  
The follow -up period  is:  
Part A - up to 5 years or until the first anticancer treatment after Betalutin administration. Survival and potential 
long-term toxicity information will continue to be collected up to 5  years, even after further anticancer treatment 
has begun. All patients will be followed closely the first year after treatment, thereafter every 6 months (See Section  
6.3 Schedul e of Assessments).  
Part B and Part C - up to 5 years after Betalutin administration.  
Extensive  follow -up (hospital  visits)  will take place  for all patients  every  3 months  for the first year  (Months  
6, 9 and 12). Tumour  imaging  assessments  are only requir ed until  the patient  has further  anticancer  
treatment  after  Betalutin  administration  or disease  progression  prior  to further  anticancer  therapy  as 
assessed  by central  imaging  review.  All other  scheduled  assessments  should  be performed.  
After  Month  12, follow -up will continue  every  6 months  up to 5 years  after  the Betalutin  dose.  Extensive  
follow -up (hospital  visits)  must  be performed  until  the patient  has further  anticancer  treatment  after  
Betalutin  administration  or disease  progression  prior  to further  anticancer  therapy  as assessed  by central  
imaging  review.  Thereafter,  the patient  will continue  limited  follow  up every  6 months  for potential  long 
term  toxicity  (new  onset  adverse  events  of special  interest  [AESIs],  ADRs  and study  treatment -related  
SAEs) , OS, further  anticancer  treatment  and ADA  testing  (only  if ADA  test is positive  at Month  12; testing  
to be continued  until  a negative  result  is obtained).  Unless  blood  sampling  is required  for ADA  testing,  
limited  follow -up visits  can be performed  by telephone.  
 
Section 6.2  Dose Escalation in Part A / Dose Definition in Special Populations in Part B  
Section has been restructured to present the definition of a DLT first (with a clarification that both dose escalation 
in Part A and dose decisions in Part B were based on the incidence of DLTs) and then to delineate the process for 
dose escalation in Part A (Section 6.2.2) and the dose definition in special populations in Part B (Section  6.2.3). 
The summary of changes here identifies changes to the original text but does not identify where text has been re -
ordered without wording changes.  
 
Section 6.2.2  Dose Escalation in Part A  
The dose escalation in Part A followed a the traditional  “3+3” design scheme shown in Table  6-2 .  
Table 6 -2 has been moved from Section 6.2 to Section 6.2.2  
Table 6 -3 and the text summarising the dose escalation already completed in Arms 1 to 5 Part A have been moved 
from Section 6.2.1 to Section 6.2.2  
Patients with a screening platelet count of 100 -150 x 109/L 
Following review of Arm 4 safety data, the SRC considered that it would be appropriate to allow patients with a 
screening platelet count of 100 -150 x 109/L to receive lilotomab 100 mg/m2 followed by Betalutin 15 MBq/kg for 
evaluation.  
 
Section 6.2.3  Dose Definition in Special Populations in Part B  
Text previously included in Section 6.2.2 has been moved to Section  4.8.1.1 without change.  
The dose escalation in each subpopulation of patients with prior autologous SCT and/or platelet count ≥100×109/L 
but <150×109/L in Part B (see Section  6.1) will follow the modified “3 + 3” design scheme shown in Table 6 -4.

1 DLT out of 3 patients  Expand this dose level with  3 more patients in the subpopulation.  
The SRC will review the overall safety of the cohort (6 patients) prior to 
establishing the dose to be recommended. Dose escalation may still be considered 
(same as for no DLT)  
2 DLTs in a subpopulation  The SRC may consider a dose reduction to “40/10” for the 2 subpopulations 
treated with “40/12.5” or may decide to close enrolment in the subpopulation. 
There will be no dose reduction of Betalutin below 10  MBq.   
 
All patients will be followed for 6 weeks. The SRC will review the safety data from each set of 3 patients 
(either 3 or 3+3) (in particular, the number of DLTs) of each subpopulation and recommend the current 
reduced dosing level be maintained, a dose esca lation (including escalation to Betalutin 15 MBq/kg with 
lilotomab 40 mg), an evaluation of an additional 3 patients, a dose -decrease, a different dose or to stop the

6-4 to Table 6 -5, Table 6 -5 to Table 6 -6, Table 6 -6 to Table 6 -7, Table 6 -7 to Table 6 -8 and Table 6 -8 to Tab le 6-9). 
Cross references in the document have been updated accordingly.  
There are separate tables for Part A phase I ( Table 6 -4 Table 6 -5), Part A phase IIa ( Table 6 -6 Table 6 -7), Part  B 
FL phase IIb and Part C (Table 6 -7 Table 6 -8).  
Pharmacokinetic and dosimetry schedule of assessments for Part A are described in Table 6 -5 Table 6 -6 and for 
Parts B and C  in Table 6 -8 Table 6 -9. In Parts B and C, pharmacokinetic assessments will be performed at selected 
sites only, whereas dosimetry assessments will be pe rformed at sites in Germany and in other agreed sites.  
During the coronavirus disease 19 (COVID -19) pandemic, every effort should be made to continue to 
perform the study visits and assessments according to the planned schedules. Where this is not possible, 
any deviations should be clearly documented. Any results of assessments performed remotely must be 
entered into the eCRF.  
Part B FL phase IIb and Part C (Pharmacokinetic Cohort):   
Added text:  
Screening assessments should be performed within 4 wee ks prior to administration of rituximab. In case of 
unforeseen delays in the planned rituximab administration, including but not limited to delay in the 
availability of Betalutin, or delay in HAMA testing or results availability, the screening period may b e 
extended upon Sponsor’s approval and the validity of imaging tests and bone marrow biopsy may be 
extended accordingly.

Section  8 Withdrawal and Termination Criteria  
The following text has been moved from Section 8.2 to Section 8.1 to clearly delineate patient withdrawal and 
termination, with the modifications shown. The start of further anticancer therapy has been removed as a reason 
for withdrawal  
Investigational Product:

 Single patient withdrawal  termination  is per definition:  
• when the patient is withdrawn during the treatment period or extensive follow -up without consent to be 
followed up for survival, collection of long -term toxicities and anticancer therapies (consented patients will 
be followed up for survival)  
• when the patie nt has died.  
• Completed the 5 year follow -up visit  
If a patient dies,  the reason for withdrawal is death , the immediate cause of death should be noted, in addition to 
death caused by underlying disease, the Investigator’s judgement on possible relationship to study drug should be 
recorded in the CRF.  
If a patient starts further  the reason for withdrawal is start of  further anticancer treatment  therapy , details of 
the new anticancer therapy regimen should be noted and recorded in the CRF. Patients who are withdrawn for 
reasons such as toxicity, or at the start of further anticancer therapy (after Betalutin) w ill continue in follow -up for 
survival and any potential long -term toxicities. Confirmation of continued consent to follow -up is recorded in the 
eCRF.  
The following text modifications were made to Section 8.1:  
It is advisable to monitor the haematology par ameters of the withdrawn patients after Betalutin administration 
until recovery to Grade 1 NCI CTCAE.   
Survival information, and potential long -term toxicity information and further anticancer therapy  will continue 
to be collected on withdrawn patients unless the patient specifically withdraws their consent (see below).  
Confirmation of continued consent to survival or collection of long term toxicities follow -up is recorded in the 
eCRF.  
The following text was removed from Section 8.2:  
As described above, consented patients who terminate for any of the above reasons will continue to be followed 
for survival and any potential long -term toxicities.  
Section 9.1  Study Treatment  
Rituximab, lilotomab and Betal utin can all be administered on an outpatient basis. The patient should be under 
surveillance at the hospital at least 2 hours after administration of Betalutin  (unless local regulations require a 
longer surveillance period).  
 
Section 9.1.1  Investigational  Drug Product Betalutin  
The product is isotonic and has a pH of 6.4 -7.4. The radioactive concentration at the reference date will depend 
on the dose level and the patient body weight; however, the dose is capped for patients who weigh more than 
130 kg (pat ients heavier than 130 kg will receive the dose for a 130 kg patient).  When administered on a day 
other than the reference day, the volume should be corrected according to the physical decay table included in the 
Drug Handling Plan. The measured Betalutin dose must be +/ -10% of the intended prescribed dose.  
 
Section 9.1.7  Lilotomab Infusion  
Lilotomab will be infused within 4 hours prior to the Betalutin administration. The infusion rate will be 
100 mL/hour . For doses of lilotomab given on a BSA basis, this Body surface area  should be calculated using 
the duBois calculation.  
 
Section 9.1.7.2  Part B (FL phase IIb)  
The following text was removed as irrelevant to a section on lilotomab infusion:  
However, the first 3 patients in each of the following sub-groups will be reviewed by the SRC. These 
patients will receive the following doses:  
• Patients with a prior auto -SCT and who have platelets ≥150x109/L will receive Betalutin at the reduced dose 
of 12.5 MBq/kg.   
• Patients with a prior auto -SCT and who have platelets <150x109/L will receive Betalutin at the reduced dose 
of 10 MBq/kg.

 • Patients without a prior SCT, but who have the lower platelet threshol d (100 to <150 x 109/L) will receive 
Betalutin at the reduced dose of 12.5 MBq/kg.   
 
Section 9.1.7.3  Part C (Pharmacokinetic Cohort, phase IIb)  
New section added  
In Part C, patients will receive the “40/15” regimen and will therefore receive 40  mg lilotomab.  
 
Section 9.2.2  Methods of Assigning Patients to Treatment - Part B (FL phase IIb)  
At the time of evaluation of the patient for enrolment, a patient number will be assigned via an Interactive Web 
Response system (IWRS). In the randomised period , patients will be enrolled to receive one of the two dosing 
regimens: “40/15” or “100/20”.  
Further changes as identified for Section  4.2.3.  
The purpose of stratification is to balance the number of double refractory patients between treatment regimens. 
No analysis within strata are planned. Randomisation records are selected by finding the next available minimum 
patient randomisation number, within the stratum, in the cent ral randomisation list. After  approximately 50 patients 
have been treated (approximately 25 per arm), there will be an interim analysis (IA) to evaluate future study 
modifications and continuation of both regimens. Subsequently, one or both arms may continue to enrol patients 
(see Section 14.3 ).  
Site users will confirm in the IWRS system when all screening procedures have been completed and the patient is 
considered eligible for enrolment. A medical monitor will review the patient and confirm that the patient is eligible 
in the IWRS system before the patient is randomised  enrolled .  
 
Section 9.2.3  Methods of Assigning Patients to Treatment - Part C (Pharmacokinetic Cohort, phase IIb)  
New section added  
At the time of evaluation of the patient for enrolment, a patient number will be assigned via an IWRS system. 
All patients will receive the “40/15” treatment regimen  
Site users will confirm in the IWRS system when all screening procedures have been comple ted and the 
patient is considered eligible for enrolment. A Sponsor medical monitor will review the patient and confirm 
that the patient is eligible in the IWRS system before the patient is entered.  
 
Section 9.5  Treatment Compliance  
Patients will receive Betalutin treatment under supervision of a nuclear medicine specialist (or any other specialist 
physician authorised to administer radiopharmaceuticals per local regulations) . Study centre personnel will 
check the administration volume and total radioactivity injected and will record the activity dose and volume 
injected in the patient’s source documents and eCRF.  
Patients will receive infusions of lilotomab and rituximab under surveillance by trained personnel used to handle 
infusions  with rituximab. The volume to be given will be prepared by the pharmacy following instructions of the 
drug handling manual  and the infusion bags will be delivered as ready to use solutions.

Section 12  Efficacy Assessments  
For Part A (phase I and phase IIa), tumour response will be determined by investigator assessment. Cheson criteria 
Versions 1999 and 2007 will be applied ( 35, 36).  
For Part B (FL phase IIb) and Part C (Pharmacoki netic Cohort) , investigator assessment will initially  be applied 
as a measure for assessment of tumour response and any urgent patient management decisions. and as a basis for 
all protocol guidelines for management of the patient related to disease status.  Tumour response will also be 
determined by independent central review and this assessment used as a basis for all protocol guidelines for 
management of the patient related to disease progression status. In presence of disease progression per 
investigator assessment, tumour assessments should continue until disease progression is documented by 
independent central review, unless an urgent patient management decision is required. All urgent patient 
management decisions will be documented. Cheson criteria Vers ion 2014 will be applied (40)     
 
Section  12.1.3  PET/CT Examination  
Standard institutional guidelines will be followed. The patient must have fasted for 6 hours prior to PET/CT

 An unexpected ADR is an ADR of which the nature or severity is not consistent with the applicable product 
information (e.g. Investigator’s Brochure for an unapproved investigational product or summary of product 
characteristics for an authorised product i. e. the Investigator’s Brochure for Betalutin or the approved product 
information (prescribing information) for rituximab). When the outcome of the ADR is not consistent with the 
applicable product information this ADR should be considered as unexpected. Reports must also be considered 
as unexpected if they add significant information on the specificity or severity of an expected ADR.  
The expectedness of an AE/ADR will be determined by the Sponsor.  
 
Section 13.1.8  Assessments of Adverse Events; Seriousness, Causality, and Severity  
Each individual AE should be evaluated by the investigator with regard to date of onset, its seriousness, severity, 
and duration, causal relationship to the IMP and/or concomitant therapy  and outcome.  
Seriousness will be determined according to the definition, sees in Section 13.1.3.  
Causality will be determined for all AEs . based on the definition in Section 13.1.2 . All AEs judged by the 
investigator or the Sponsor  as having a reasonable  suspected causal relationship to an IMP qualify as ADRs ( as 
defined in Section 13.1.2 ). The Sponsor will not overrule the causality assessment given by the investigator. If the 
Sponsor disagrees with the investigator’s causality assessment, both the opinion of the investigator and the Sponsor 
will be provided with the report.  
All toxicities/AEs will be graded according to CTCAE.  
 
Section 13.2  Reporting of Adverse Events  
Any AEs that occur after a patient has signed the Informed Consent Form and up to 12 weeks after Day 0, must be 
reported, whether or not it is considered related to any of the study medications  
After 12 weeks post last administration of study treatment, only new onset AESIs, and study treatment -
related AEs and SAEs must be reported when the y come to the investigator’s attention.  
All AEs will be reported in the patient eCRFs. If more than one AE occurs, each event should be recorded 
separately. AEs and/or laboratory abnormalities shall be reported to the Sponsor according to the reporting 
requirements and within the time periods specified in the protocol. All AEs will be followed up until resolved or 
as clinically required. AEs that occur from 12 weeks after Day 0 that are judged to be related to any of the study 
medications will be reported when they come to the investigator’s attention.  
Specific information about secondary malignancies such as leukaemia, MDS and aplastic anaemia or any other 
malignancy, will be collected up to 5 years after study medication administration or relapse of disea se, including 
information about treatment given to the patient due to NHL. See also paragraph on Adverse Events of Special 
Interest in Section 13.1.7.  
Death  is not defined as an AE but as an outcome of an AE. It is important that the event leading to the d eath is 
reported. If death is the outcome of an AE , it will be reported as an AE  such  for (i) all AEs regardless of 
relationship to study treatment  up to 12 weeks after Betalutin injection  the last administration of study 
treatment and (ii) AESI, and study treatment related AEs and SAEs with onset >12 weeks after the last 
administration of study treatment . Thereafter, death it will be collected in the eCRFs as survival information. It 
will be reported as the outcome of an ADR when it is judged as related to IMP.        
Progression of disease:  
• Part A: Progression of disease will be reported as an AE until Week 12. Thereafter progression of disease 
will be recorded in the eCRF and still used as an efficacy endpoint. It will be the SRC who will decide if a  
fatal outcome of disease progression should be considered as an expected AE. This will depend on the 
information received and medical consideration.  
• Part B and C : Disease progression is not reported as an AE if it is clearly consistent with the suspected  
progression as determined by the protocol. Hospitalisation due solely to disease progression should NOT 
be reported as a SAE. Any associated symptoms may be reported as adverse events if there is any uncertainty 
about the symptom being exclusively due to disease progression, or if it does not fit the expected pattern of 
progression of the disease.  
 
Section 13.3.1  Reporting of Serious Adverse Events – Investigator’s Responsibilities  
The investigator shall report all SAEs, regardless of suspected causality , occurring after the patient has provided 
informed consent and until at least 12 weeks following study drug administration, immediately (within 24 hours of

 the investigator becoming aware of the event) to the Sponsor ’s representative or assigned designee . The immediate 
report shall be followed by detailed written report(s).  
• SAEs will be reported in the following time periods:  
• SAEs will be collected from signing informed consent to ensure that any protocol -related SAEs are 
collected.  
• Up to 12 weeks after the last administration  end of study treatment, whether or not considered related to 
IMP.  
At any time after 12 weeks after the last administration  last injection  of study treatment  when it comes to the 
investigator’s attention and is judged to be related to the patient’s participation in the study or related to  the 
IMP.  
Any SAEs experienced after this 12 week period should only be reported to Nordic Nanovector  the Sponsor or 
assigne d designee  if the investigator suspects a causal relationship to the study treatment, or if it is an AESI (see 
Section 13.1.7). Recurrent episodes, complications or progression of the initial SAE must be reported as follow -up 
to the original episode within  24 hours of the investigator receiving the follow -up information. An SAE occurring 
at a different time interval or otherwise considered completely unrelated to a previously reported one should be 
reported separately as a new event.  
All SAEs must be report ed to Sponsor ’s representative or assigned designee  as follows:  
1. Immediately (within 24 hours of discovery of the event) report the event to representative  by email, 
telephone or fax.  
2. Complete the SAE report form and send it to representative  within 3  working days of the discovery of the 
event.  
3. Follow -up the SAE until resolved or as clinically required, all follow -up evaluations must be reported to 
representative.  
4. Record the SAE in the patient eCRFs provided.  
5. Document the SAE in the hospital r ecords.  
It is important to send “as complete as possible” a report within the timelines. Incomplete information must NOT 
delay reporting of SAEs. Additional information must be reported once it is available; in follow -up reports using 
the same SAE forms, b ut marked as a follow -up report. In Part A, SAEs/SUSARs will be reviewed by both the 
SRC and the Sponsor.   
The Sponsor or assigned designee is responsible for reporting all the relevant safety information to the concerned 
Competent Authorities and to the Ecs/IRBs concerned. Where applicable as per local requirements, the investigator 
will inform the Ethics Committee (EC)/Institutional Review Board (IRB) and/or the Competent Authority  of the 
SAE. For reporting death of a patient, the investigator shall supply the Sponsor and the EC with any additional 
information requested.  
The Investigator is also responsible for reporting to the Sponsor within 24 hours the occurrence of a new 
pregnancy (see Section 16.3.7) and IMP dosing errors (see Section 16.3.6). to the  Sponsor or assigned 
designee within 24 hours.  
 
Section 13.3.2  Reporting of Serious Adverse Events - Sponsor’s Responsibilities  
The Sponsor or assigned designee  is responsible for the ongoing safety evaluation of the IMP.  
The Sponsor or assigned designee  is responsible for the prompt notification to all concerned investigators, the 
ECs/IRBs and Competent Authorities where Betalutin studies are ongoing, of all the relevant safety information, 
including  findings that affect the health of the patients, impact on the conduct of the study or alter the Competent 
Authority’s authorisation to continue the study in accordance with Directive 2001/20/EC.  
The Sponsor has to keep detailed records of all AeEs reported to him by the investigators and to perform an 
evaluati on with respect to seriousness, causality and expectedness. These records shall be submitted to the 
Competent Authorities in the countries where the clinical study is being conducted, if they so request.  
Each individual AE should be evaluated by the Sponsor or assigned designee , with regard to its seriousness and 
causal relationship to the IMP and/or concomitant therapy. The Sponsor will not overrule the causality 
assessment given by the investigator. If t he Sponsor disagrees with the investigator’s causality assessment,

Section 13.4.1  Diagnosis and Medical History  
A histological diagnosis of relapsed incurable NHL of following subtypes; follicular grade I IIIA, marginal zone, 
small lymphocytic, lymphoplasmacytic, or mantle cell is established by the pathologist at the study site for Part  A 
and Part C  of the study OR follicular grade I -IIIA for Part B. The proficiency of anti -CD37 -antibodies at detec ting 
have been tested against FL samples and shown to be suitable for identifying CD37 positive cells.  
For patients enrolling in Part B and Part C , tumour tissue will be obtained to assess CD37 expression by the 
tumour cells. The tumour tissue samples will be sent to an accredited laboratory in the European Union 
(EU) or US for CD37 testing .  slides for central laboratory staining for CD37 will be obtained. Tumour blocks for 
central biobanking may also be obtained, this is optional for the patient.  STumou r tissue samples will be sent to 
Covance Central Laboratories in Harrogate, UK for staining.  The results of the analysis are not necessary for 
inclusion in the study (with the exception of patients entering in Germany) , but will be captured in the eCRF.  
A summary of the patient’s relevant medical history prior to study inclusion should be recorded on the appropriate 
eCRF page.  
CT with contrast agent will be performed at baseline for identifying the tumour lesions. MRI scans for patients 
with contrast alle rgy are acceptable . 
A bone marrow biopsy will be taken from a site not previously irradiated to ensure that there are less than 25% 
tumour cells (this may be taken up to 8 weeks before the rituximab administration).  
Section 13.4.6.2  Immunogenicity Assessments - Part B FL Phase IIb and Part C Pharmacokinetic Cohort  phase 
IIa 
All patients included in Part B and Part C  of the LYMRIT 37 -01 study will be monitored for the development of 
ADA after treatment up to 12 months.  
Instructions for  handling procedures, preparation, storage and shipping of the serum samples will be provided in 
the study Covance  laboratory manual.

Section  13.4.5  Clinical Laboratory Parameters  
Clarification added to Table 13 -2 that the following were for Part B and Part C only: coagulation, HIV test, 
hepatitis  C 
Table note added to Table 13 -2: **At screening only; post -dose urine pregnancy tests will also be performed in 
Parts B and C  
The investigator will interpret all clinical laboratory test results o utside the reference range. using the following 
criteria:  
1 = Value out of reference range, but not a clinically significant worsening from previous examination.  
2 = Value out of reference range, and a clinically significant worsening from previous examination.  
Laboratory values outside reference range recorded in the CTCAE, will be graded 1 to 4 according to the CTCAE 
criteria. The laboratory CTCAE grade will be derived programmatically for the purpose of reporting in the 
Clinical Study Report.  
 
Section 13.4.8  Potential Long -term Toxicity  
At the follow -up visits the investigator will observe for indications of potential late -toxicity, such as secondary 
cancers, acute myelogenous leukaemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, and aplastic anaemia. In addition,  physical 
examination will be performed and blood samples for biochemistry and haematology taken. Potential long -term 
toxicity (new onset AESIs, and study treatment -related AEs and SAEs only with onset >12 weeks after the

Section  14.1.2  Sample Size and Statistical Hypotheses  – Part B (phase IIb) Follicular Lymphoma  
Subsections 14.1.2.1, 14.1.2.2 and 14.1.2.3 were added:  
14.1.2.1  Randomised Part B - Choice of RP2D  
Note - Part B of the study was initiated as  is a randomised, 2 -arm, open -label study to further differentiate th e 
risk/benefit of 2 promising dose regimens of lilotomab and Betalutin. (Protocol Version 11)  <text moved from 
Section 14.2, with modifications shown>.  
In total, up to 130 patients (65 patients per candidate regimen)  with FL will be enrolled.  
Based on response  data to-date available at time of Protocol Version 11 , a dose difference of 27% in ORR is 
expected to emerge between the dose regimens with similar low toxicity profiles. The ORR’s assumed for each 
group are: 69% for the 40 mg lilotomab+15 MBq/kg Betalutin arm, and 42% for the 100 mg/m2 
lilotomab+20  MBq/kg Betalutin  arm. 
A sample size of 65 patients per group  arm should be sufficient to detect this difference, using a two -sided 
significance level 0.05 with at least 80% statistical power.  Sample size estimation was performed using nQuery 
Advisor V7 (Statsol.com). The  method was a 2 group continuity corrected chi -square test for equal proportions 
(55).  
14.1.2.2  Interim Analysis – Part B Randomised  
<text moved from Section 14.3>  
Note - The interim analysis was introduced in Protocol Version 11 and amended in protocol V ersion 13.  
14.1.2.3  Part B – Population treated with “40/15” Regimen  
Note - At the interim analysis, the SRC decided to discontinue the “100/20” treatment regimen, and continue 
with further recruitment in the “40/15” treatment regimen only.  
A total of 87 p atients, including the those from the interim analysis, will be recruited and treated with the 
“40/15” regimen.  
With 87 patients, there will be more than 90% power to detect a difference of 18% in response rates using 
a two -sided exact test with a target significance level of 0.05, assuming the response rate under the null 
hypothesis is 30% and the response rate under the alternative hypothesis is 48%. If there are at least 36 
responders in 87 patients, then there will be at least 97.5% chance that the true  response rate will be at least 
30%.  
Moreover, with 87 patients, there will also be more than 90% power to detect a difference in complete 
response rate of 8% under the null hypothesis versus 20% under the alternative hypothesis.  
 
Section  14.1.3   Part C (p hase IIa) Pharmacokinetic Cohort  
New section added  
At least 10 patients (up to a maximum of 20 patients, all treated with the “40/15” treatment regimen) will be 
entered into Part C. This number is based on feasibility and the minimum number of patients evaluable for 
pharmacokinetic analyses (profiles and pharmacokinetic parameter summaries).  
For the purpose of  pharmacokinetic parameter evaluation and analysis, patients with FL entered into Part 
B who have also provided PK samples, and who are treated with “40/15” treatment regimen may be 
combined with patients entered into Part C.

Definition of populations  
The following 3 4 populations are defined:  
• Pharmacokinetic (PK) : The PK Population will be defined as all subjects who received at least a dose of 
Betalutin and have evaluable PK data, and a complete or agreed sparse scheduled post -dose PK 
measurements without protocol deviations, violations,  or events thought to sign ificantly affect the PK of the 
drug.  
Part C (Pharmacokinetic Cohort, phase IIa)  
The primary pharmacokinetic analyses will be conducted on the PK population.  
 
Section 14.1.5  Statistical Methods  
Section renumbered from 14.1.4  
Results from Part A (Phase I and Phase IIa), Part B and Part C  will be summarised separately due to differences 
in study design, dose regimens and patient populations. However, analyses in specific populations and for 
specific dose regimens may be performe d in the overall study population  from Part B because patients treated 
in Part A were treated in 3+3 ascending cohorts.   
The results from this study will be presented mostly using descriptive statistical methods. Details of planned 
analyses for Parts A, and B and C  will be provided in separate statistical analysis plans.  
Prior to database lock and analysis of the final study data, a detailed Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) will be 
prepared and approved, describing all the analyses to be performed. The SAP will document any changes 
to the analyses described in this protocol.  
 
Section  14.1.6  Analysis of Demographic and Pre -treatment Characteristics

Section 14.1.7  Analysis of Efficacy Data  
New section added and description of all efficacy analyses moved to one section  
Tumour response will be reported as follows in individual patients:  
• CR 
• PR 
• SD 
• PD 
• NE 
In Part A and Part C: Response rate will be presented as a point estimate of the proportion of responders along with 
the 95 % exact confidence interval of response rate.  
In Part B randomised period : The ORR will be compared between dosing regimens using the Fisher’s Exact test, 
and the difference in response rates and the corresponding 95% exact CI will be presented . ORR estimates 
and 95% exact CI for each dosing regimen  will also b e presented.  
In Part B Single -arm 40/15 part: – The primary efficacy analysis on ORR (based on independent assessment) will 
be performed by testing whether the ORR is less than or equal to 30% against the alternative hypothesis 
that ORR is greater than 20% at overall two -sided 5% level of significance, i.e.,  
H0: p = 0.3 vs. Ha: p ≠ 0.3  
In addition, the secondary efficacy analysis on CRR (based on independent assessment) will be performed 
by testing whether the CRR is less than or equal to 8% against  the alternative hypothesis that ORR is greater 
than 8% at overall two -sided 5% level of significance, i.e.,  
H0: p = 0.08 vs. Ha: p ≠ 0.08

 Responders are defined as having CR and PR according to definition in Section 12.3.  
Time to event endpoints will be analysed using standard Kaplan -Meier techniques. The estimate of the median 
survival curve will be calculated along with the associated 95% confidence intervals (when applicable).  Time 
to event data will be presented in cumulative distribution plots along w ith the Kaplan -Meier estimates of the median 
time to event, when estimable.   
The efficacy endpoints are:  
Text moved from Section 12.4, with changes shown:  
Overall Response Rate (ORR)  
ORR, defined as the proportion of patients who achieve a CR or PR assessed with the use of standard criteria for 
lymphoma (1). The ORR will be assessed at 3 months image evaluation.  
Best ORR will also be evaluated, taking the best response achieved independent of time point for image evaluation.  
Complete Response Rate (CRR)  
CRR, defined as the proportion of patients who achieve a CR assessed with the use of standard criteria for 
lymphoma (1). The CRR will be calculated based on complete responses achieved at any timepoint.  
Progression -free survival (PFS)  
PFS is defined as the interval from Betalutin administration and date of:  
• Relapse (new or enlarged lesions after CR).  
• Progression (new or enlarged lesions after PR or SD).  
• Death from any cause.  
If none of t he above events are observed, PFS will be censored at the date of the last adequate tumour  assessment 
(i.e. last CT scan).  
Duration of response (DoR)  
DoR is the time from when criteria for response (CR or PR) is are first met to the time of relapse or progression. 
Patients who have not relapsed/progressed will be censored at the last adequate tumour assessment.  
Duration of Complete Response (DoCR)  
DoCR is the time from when the complete response is first observed to the time of relapse. Patients who have 
not relapsed will be censored at the last adequate tumour assessment.  
Overall survival (OS)  
OS is defined as the time from administration of Betalutin to the date of death from any cause. Patients still alive 
or lost to follow -up are censored at the last date they were known to be alive. Patients still alive are censored at the 
last known date al ive as captured in the survival follow up . 
During the study and after its completion the cause of death will be registered.

Section  14.2 Analysis for Patients in Part B with FL  
Section renumbered from 14.4  
The statistical analysis for Part B (in relation to the current single -arm design) will be performed at the following 
timepoints after last patient has been dosed with Betalutin:  
• After a ll patients have had at least one post -treatment tumour assessment: This will consist of the 
baseline data, efficacy data on ORR, CRR and preliminary assessment on the longer -term efficacy 
outcomes (DoR, DoCR), and selected safety data. No change to the tr ial conduct nor the statistical 
analysis plan is envisaged.  
• 9 months post Betalutin administration (6 -month follow up of response for all patients with PR or 
CR): This will consist of the baseline data, efficacy data on ORR, CRR and preliminary assessment 
on the longer -term efficacy outcomes (DoR, DoCR, PFS, OS), a nd all safety data accumulated to this 
point.  
• 15 months post Betalutin administration (12 -months follow up of response for all patients with PR or 
CR): This will include updated analysis on the longer -term efficacy outcomes (DoR, DoCR, PFS and 
OS) and updated long -term safety data.  
• 5 years: Final analysis will include long -term efficacy outcomes and safety data.  
The final efficacy analysis of patients with FL will occur after the last patient has received Betalutin and all enrolled 
patients with FL have h ad the opportunity to be followed up for at least 24 weeks (6 months). Safety and 
immunogenicity data will be included. All visits from all patients will be included in this analysis.  
Therefore, the timing of the final efficacy analyses from Part B will de pend on the time taken to recruit the patients 
to Part B.

be published if relevant.  
 
Section 14.3  Timing of Analysis in Part C (Pharmacokinetic Cohort)  
New section added  
Pharmacokinetic parameters will be analyzed and summarized at the same time as the final analysis of 
patients in Part B  (Section 14.2). Pharmacokinetic data from patients with FL entered to Part B (and who 
have also provided pharmacokinetic samples) may be combined with iNHL patients entered to Part C 
(assuming a dose regimen of “40/15”).  
The analysis of pharmacokinetic parameters is described in Section 14.1.8.  
 
Section 15.3  Data Management  
AEs and SAEs will be handled in the same way as the other data reported in the eCRF. However, in addition the 
initial notification of SUSARs will be coded and  medicall y assessed for reporting to authorities according to 
national regulatory requirements.  
 
Section 15.4  Retention of Documents  
The following information must be retained for at least 15 years after the last approval of a marketing application

marketing applications in an ICH region; or at least 15 years have elapsed since the formal discontinuation of 
clinical development of the IMP: source data, source documents (including scans/imaging data),  eCRFs, protocol 
and amendments, drug accountability forms, correspondence, patient i dentification list, informed consent forms, 
and any other essential documents.  
 
Section  16.3.6  Collection of IMP Dosing Errors  
New section added  
A reportable IMP dosing error is defined as follows:  
• Betalutin: greater than +10% of the intended dose.  
• Lilot omab 40 mg: a dose <30 mg or a dose >70 mg  
The investigator must report an IMP dosing error to the Sponsor’s representative   or assigned designee 
within 24 hours of treatment administration or within 24 hours of the error having been identified, followin g 
the process for SAE reporting in Section 13.3.  
 
Section  16.3.7.1  Collection of Pregnancy Information - Male Participants with Partners who become Pregnant  
Section renumbered from 16.3.6.1  
After obtaining the necessary signed informed consent from the pre gnant female partner directly, the investigator 
will record pregnancy information on the appropriate form and submit it to the Sponsor or assigned designee  
within 24 hours of learning of the partner’s pregnancy following the process for SAE reporting in Section 13.3.  
 
Section  16.4 Safety Review Committee (SRC)  
A SRC will periodically review and monitor the safety of patients in this study, .and provide recommendations for 
dose escalation . The SRC will consist of 3 to 4 relevant experts (haematologists/oncologists) including the 
coordinating investigator for the study.  
The following safety data are examples of data that may be collected and evaluated for the  SRC:  
• AEs.  
• Laboratory variables: serum chemistry and haematology (Complete blood count (CBC)).  
• Immunogenicity  
• Vital signs (systolic/diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, and body temperature).  
• 12-lead ECG at baseline.  
Investigational Product:

 • Physical examination, including WHO ( ECOG) PS.  
• Long -term toxicity  <paragraph moved from Section  13 without change>  
In Part A,  The SRC (Safety Review Committee) and the Sponsor’s representative will review the safety data 
throughout the course of the study. The  the SRC will make made  recommendations for dose escalation and 
expansion according to Table 6 -2 in Part A .  
In Part B, the SRC reviewed the safety and efficacy data from the first 47 patients in the randomised section  and 
recommended the future dose for development  to be liloto mab 40 mg and Betalutin 15 MBq/kg.  
The SRC will also review the safety data (in particular, DLTs)  from the first 3 patients in each of the following  
sub-groups of patients in the special  populations in Part B . These patients will receive the following doses:  
Patients with a prior autologous -SCT and who have platelets ≥150×x109/L will be followed for at least 6 weeks. 
These patients will receive Betalutin at the reduced dose of 12.5 MBq/kg.   
Patients with a prior autologous -SCT and who have pl atelets <150×x109/L will be followed for at least 6 weeks. 
These patients will receive Betalutin at the reduced dose of 10 MBq/kg.  
Patients without a prior SCT, but who have the lower platelet threshold (100 to <150× x 109/L) will be followed 
for at least 6 weeks. These patients will receive Betalutin at the reduced dose of 12.5 MBq/kg.  
The safety data from the first 3 patients in each subgroup were evaluated separately  (see Section 6.1) and make 
recommendations according to Table 6 4 .  
In Part C,  the SRC  may review emerging data from patients entered to Part C  at the same time as data from patients 
entered to Part B is reviewed.  
 
Section  16.5 Independent Review Committee (IRC) - Parts B and C  
From Part C, the IRC may review the radiological and pertinent clinical data from patients entered to this 
cohort.

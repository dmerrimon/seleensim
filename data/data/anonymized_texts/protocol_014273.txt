CR-6283 ,Statistical Analysis Plan Version 2.0 Page 6of 321. INTRODUCTION
This statistical analysis plan (SAP) describes the analyses and  data presentations for protocol CR-
6283 Version 3.0.
This document will serve as the final guidance for all the stat istical analysis for this study and will 
supersede the Statistical Method section in the protocol if the re are any discrepancies. Any 
deviation from the analysis pla n will be documented as such in the clinical study report.
2. STUDY OBJECTIVES
The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate non-inferiority of the Test lens compared to 
the Control lens with respect to CLUE comfort, vision satisfact ion in bright lighting, Slit Lamp 
Findings (Grade 3 or higher) and Distance Monocular logMAR Visual Acuity. This study will also 
aim to show that the Fit Acceptance rate is at least 90% while w earing the Test lens. The secondary 
objective of this study is to demonstrate non-inferiority of the  Test lens compare to the Control 
lens with respect to CLUE Overall quality of Vision and Handlin g and overall quality of vision 
outdoors.
This study also aims to explore the performance of Indoor, Outd oor and Driving performance 
using individual questionnaire items. 
3. STUDY DESIGN
3.1. Overview
This study is a randomized, 4-visit, partially subject-masked, 2x3 bilateral crossover, dispensing 
trial.  Approximately 120 subjects will be screened and enrolle d to ensure that at least 105 subjects 
complete.
The study begins with an initial visit (Visit 1). If a subject is found to meet all eligibility criteria, 
they will be randomized to one of two lens wear sequences (Test /Control/Control or 
Control/Test/Test). If the subject is dispensed their first study lenses at the initial visit then 3 additional visits will be 
conducted. Their first follow-up visit will occur at approrimxatel y 2-weeks after intial dispensing 
(Visit 2). At visit 2, subjects will be dispensed their next lens as specified per the randomization.Subjects ’follow-up for their second lens will occur approximately 2-week s after visit 2 (Visit 3). 
Subjects will be dispensed their last study lens (per the randomization) at visit 3 and will return 
for their final follow-up visit (visit 4) approximately 2-week after visit 3.  Unscheduled follow-up 
visits may occur during the study. Subjects will be advised to wear the study lenses at least five 
(5) days per week for at least six (6) hours per day for a peri od of two-weeks each.

3.3. Targeted Study Population and Sample Size
Approximately 120 subjects will be enrolled to ensure that at l east 105 subjects will complete the 
study.  Enrolled subjects will be habitual wearers of spherical contact lenses.  All subjects will be 
the age of 18 and <49 years old.  Eligible presbyopes will be th ose that wear full distance contact 
lenses in both eyes, then wear reading glasses over them.  Subj ects will be randomized to either 
Test/Control/Control or Control/Test/Test. Each lens will be wo rn for approximately 2 weeks in a 
bilateral fashion as DW totaling in a study duration of approximate ly 42 days (6 weeks) per subject.

Randomized 57 57 114
Completed 54 54 108
Number of enrolled per site 10 10 20
3.4. Test Article Allocation and Masking
A computer-generated randomization scheme will be used to random ly assign subjects, in blocks 
of 2, to one of the two possible lens wear sequences (TEST/CONTR OL/CONTROL or 
CONTROL/TEST/TEST). The random scheme will be generated using t he PROC PLAN 
procedure from SAS Software Version 9.4 or higher (SAS Institute , Cary, NC).
The study site must follow the randomization scheme provided an d complete enrollment according 
to the randomization list and not pre-select or assign subjects . The randomized assignment of 
subjects will be performed at the first visit prior to the first fitting. The following must have 
occurred prior to randomization:
xInformed consent has been obtained
xSubject meets all the inclusion / exclusion criteria
xSubject history and baseline information has been collected.
Complete masking is impossible due to the functioning nature of  the Test lens.However, both the 
Test and Control were overlabeled in order to reduce bias as mu ch as possible since the Control 
lens may be the subject’s habi tual lens by chance.  Therefore, the study is partially-subject  masked 
(Control lens only).

4. STUDY ENDPOINTS
4.1. Primary Endpoints
Primary Efficacy Endpoints:
CLUE Overall Comfort
Overall comfort scores will be assessed usin g the Contact Lens User Experience (CLUE™)1
questionnaire at the two-week follow-up.  CLUE is a validated p atient-reported outcomes 
questionnaire to assess patient-ex perience attributes of soft c ontact lenses (comfort, vision, 
handling, and packaging) in a contact-lens wearing population i n the US, ages 18-65. Derived 
CLUE scores, using Item Response Theory (IRT), follow a normal d istribution with a population 
average score of 60 (SD 20), where higher scores indicate a mor e favorable/positive response. A
5 point increase in an average CLUE score translates into 10% s hift in the distribution of scores 
for a population of soft contact lens wearers1.  The handling scores will be generated using the 
flexMIRT software version 3 or higher (Chapel Hill, NC).
Distance Monocular Contact Lens Visual Acuity
Distance monocular contact lens visual performance (logMAR) is assessed for each subject eye at 
the two-week follow-up evaluation using EDTRS charts under two lighting conditions, (1) Bright 
illumination low contrast and (2) Dim Illumination High Contrast.
Vision Satisfaction in Bright Lighting
Vision satisfaction in bright light ingwill be assessed using the individual item 
“I was satisfied with the quality of my vision in bright light ing” from the CLUE™ questionnaire. 
Johnson & Johnson Vision Confidential
CR-6283 ,Statistical Analysis Plan Version 2.0 Page 10of 32This item uses the response scale, 1: Strongly Disagree, 2: Disa gree, 3: Neither Agree nor 
Disagree, 4: Agree and 5: Strongly Agree. 
Primary Safety Endpoints:
Slit Lamp Findings (Grade 3 or Higher)
Slit Lamp Findings will be assessed using the FDA Grading scale ranfing from 0 to 4, where Grade 
0 represents the absence of findings and 1 to 4 representing su ccessively worse findings (i.e. Grade 
1=trace, Grade 2= mile, Grade 3=moderate and Grade 4= severe). The assessment will include 
conjunctival injection, corneal e dema, corneal neovasluralizati on, corneal staining, tarsal 
abnormalities or any other complication. SLF assessements will be conducted for each subject eye 
at all scheduled study visits(Fitting [Visit 1] and 2-Week Follow-up [Visit 2]). The percentage of eyes with Grade 3 or higher slit lamp findings will be analyzed ; eyes with multiple events will be 
counted only once.
Fit Acceptance Rate
Acceptable lens fit will be assessed for each subject eye at al l scheduled study visits (fitting [visit 
1] and follow-up [visit 2]).  Fit acceptance rate will be based  on the lens fit acceptance of eyes 
wearing the Test lens only.  Fit rates of the Control lens will  also be collected but are not a primary 
endpoint.
4.2. Secondary Endpoints
CLUE Overall Quality of Vision and Handling 
Overall Quality of vision and handling scores will be assessed u sing the Contact Lens User 
Experience (CLUE)1questionnaire at the two-week follow-up.
Overall Quality of Vision Outdoors 
Overall quality of visio n outdoors will be assessed using the individual item 
“Overall quality of vision outdoors ” from the market research questionnaire. This item uses the 
response scale, 0: Not Applicable, 1: Excellent, 2: Very Good, 3: Good, 4: Fair  and 5: Poor.
4.3. Other EndpointsLens Preferences
Lens preferences will be assessed by individual items regarding lens preference at the two-week 
follow-up of the second wearing period (Visit 3). Subjects will be asked to choose for each 
preference item one of the following responses: Strongly Prefer  the first lens, Prefer the first lens, 
no preference, prefer the second lens, strongly prefer the seco nd lens. Lens preference questions 
consist of:
1.Overall lens preference 
2.Overall comfort 
3.Overall vision 
4.Overall reduction of glare

(fitting and follow-up).  Continuous variables will be summariz ed with descriptive statistics (n, 
Johnson & Johnson Vision Confidential
CR-6283 ,Statistical Analysis Plan Version 2.0 Page 15of 32mean, standard deviation [SD], median, minimum and maximum). Fr equency count and 
percentage of subjects or eyes within each category will be pro vided for categorical data.
8.3. Reporting Numerical Values
Means, medians and confidence/credible intervals will be report ed to one decimal place greater 
than the original data. The standard deviation will be reported to two decimal places greater than 
the original data. Minimum and maximum will use the same number  of decimal places as the 
original data. P-values greater or equal than 0.0001 will be reported to 4 decimal places; p-values 
less than 0.0001 will be reported as “<0.0001”. All pe rcentages will be reported to one decimal 
place.
8.4. Sample Size Justification
This study was designed and powered to show non-inferiority of the Test lens compared to the 
Control lens with respect to logMAR Visual Acuity, Slit Lamp Fi ndings (Grade 3 or higher), 
CLUE comfort, handling and overall quality of vision. It was as sumed there was no difference 
between the Test and Control lens with respect to visual acuity  and slit lamp findings. Based on 
data from 3 historical studies, it was assumed there was a 5-, 3- and 4-point difference between 
the Test and Control lenses with respect to CLUE comfort, handl ing and overall quality of vision, 
respectively. 
In addition to the endpoints mentioned above this study was als o powered to demonstrate non-
inferiority of the Test lens relative to the Control lens with respect to vision satisfaction in bright 
lighting, overall quality of vision indoors and the proportion of eyes with acceptable fitting while 
the Test lens is significantly superior to 90%. Unless otherwise specified, the sample size was 
calculated to achieve a minimum statistical power of 80% and a type I error of 5%. 
A total of 5 historical studies were utilized in the sample size calculation. Table 5 displays the studies, their corresponding study design and the number of sub jects enrolled and completed per-
protocol.

Acceptable Lens Fit 
Acceptable lens fit is a binary response as y=1 if a subject ey e has an acceptable fit and y=0
otherwise. Indicated by the historical data there was only 1 obs erved unacceptable lens fittings for 
the Test lens therefore, the common reference rate of 95% was s elected for the sample size 
calculation, since this is considered to be a more conservative reference proportion. Assuming a 
correlation 0.80 between measurements within the same subject a nd period (intra-eye correlation);
and assuming a correlation of 0.50 between measurements within the same subject across periods.
A total of 2000 replicating trials were simulated to estimate a  s a m p l e  s i z e  w i t h  a  m i n i m u m  
statistical power of 80%.
Slit Lamp Findings
There were no Grade 3 or higher SLFs observed in any of the hist orical studies. Assuming no 
difference between study lenses and a correlation 0.80 between l eft and right eyes within the same 
subject and period; and a correlation of 0.50 between measurements within the same subject across 
periods (intra-subject correlation) . A reference rate of no more than 5% was assumed (worse-case 
scenario) with a non-inferiority odds ratio margin of 2. A total of 2000 replicating trials were simulated, each replicated sample was analyzed using a generali zed estimating equation (GEE) 
model with a binary distribution and the logit as the link func tion. Each model included lens type 
as the only fixed, eye was included as a random effect. The Odd s ratio and corresponding 95% 
confidence interval was used est imate differences between the T est and Control lenses. The upper 
limit of each 95% confidence interval was compared to 2; if the  upper limit was below 2 then 
NI=1; otherwise NI=0. Statistical power was calculated at the a verage NI. A sample size of 50 was 
chosen to achieve a minimum statistical power of 80%.  
The non-inferiority odds ratio margin of 2 corresponds to no mo re than a 5% difference between 
the Test and Control lenses assuming the Control reference rate  does not exceed 5%.

As indicated in Table 11 and 12 above, the sample size chosen for  this study was primarly driven 
by overall quality of vision indoors.  The plan is to enroll 12 0 eligible subjects with a target of 
105 subjects to complete the study. During the enrollment perio d, the subject drop-out rate with 
be closely monitored, if an unexp ectedly high dropout rate is o bserved, then the targeted total 
enrollment number maybe be incr eased accordingly to ensure that  a minimum of 105 subjects 
complete the study. 
8.5. Statistical Significance Level
All planned analysis will be conducted with an overall type I error rate of 5%. There will be neither 
adjustment for multiple tests nor adjustment for multiplicity o f endpoints. Unless otherwise 
specified, all statistical t ests will be 2-sided.

CR-6283 ,Statistical Analysis Plan Version 2.0 Page 20of 328.6. Handling of Missing Data and Drop-outs
Missing or spurious values will not be imputed. The count of mi ssing values will be included in 
the summary tables and listings. 
Subject dropout is expected to be one of the main reasons of mi ssing data in this clinical trial. Past 
clinical trials don bt provide the evidence that subject dropout is systematic or no t-atrandom. To 
evaluate the impact of missing data, sensitivity analysis will be conducted using multiple 
imputation methods if the proportion of subject dropout is grea ter than the 15%. The SAS/STAT 
procedures PROC MI and PROC MIANALYZE will be utilized with a parametric regression 
method used to make at least 10 imputations.
9. INTERIM ANALYSIS AND DATA MONITORING COMMITTEE REVIEW
An interim analysis will be conducted after the first 75subjects complete the first wearing period 
or 4 -weeks post first subject first visit. The interim analysis will consist of descriptively 
summarizing safety and efficacy parameters. The results will be  reviewed with historical data with 
lenses from the pil ot line before the design validation study,  is initiated.  The results will 
be communicated to study responsible clinician, project lead an d platform lead. No statistical 
analysis will be conducted on the interim data.

Distance monocular visual acuity (logMAR) will be tested under two conditions (bright 
illumination low contrast and dim illumination high contrast). Each condition will be analyzed 
separately using a Bayesian multivariate normal random-effects model to compare the Test and 
Control lenses. The regression model will include sequence of l ens wear, lens type and first-order

IG(0.001, 0.001) for σs2.
Hypothesis Testing:
For each preference item, the null and alternative hypotheses for superiority are as follows: 
Ho: OR k≤ 1 Ha: OR k> 1; where OR krepresents the odds ratio of comparing the Test lens to the 
Control lens with regard to item k.  The odds ratio is calculat ed as:
OR k= p .k1(1- p. k2)/p. k2(1-p. k1),
where p. kl is the mean estimate p ijkl for k=1, ..., 5 and l = 1, …, 4.
For each item k, the superiority will be declared if the lower b ound of the 2-sided 95% credible 
interval of OR kis greater than 1: Pr(OR k> 1|y) ≥ .975. 
Outdoor Glare Reduction 
Outdoor Glare reduction consists of 4 individual questionnaire items.
1. Ability to see comfortably in bright sunlight2. Reduction in glare caused by bright sunlight 3. Reduction of squinting in bright sunlight4. Reduction of eyestrain in bright sunlight 
All outdoor glare items are assessed using the same ordinal scale (1=Excellent …5=Poor). Outdoor Glare reduction items will be analyzed separately using a Bayes ian multinomial model for ordinal 
data adjusting for baseline.  The regression model will include  sequence of lens wear, lens type, 
period and first order carryover effect. Clinical site and subject nested within clinical site will be included as random effects. Other subject characteristics such as age, gender, race and iris category 
will be included when appropriate.

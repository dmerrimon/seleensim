CONFIDENTIAL1.3 Protocol Amendmen t 4Summary of Changes
This sect ion describes the changes in reference to the Protocol Incorporating Amendment No. 4.
Amendment 4is mainly  necessi tated by  the pharmacokinet ic (PK) , safety , and physio logically 
based PK modeling of data from the sent inel cohort completed at a designated site .Addit ional 
clarificati onshave been m ade to the excluded and allowed medicat ions and treatments , entry
criteria, and other items to avoi d protocol  deviat ions.
The primary  reasons for thi s amendment are to:
Allow enrollment of ol der subjects with Parkinson disease aged 66 to 85 y ears, inclusive, at a 
dose l evel of TAK -071 5 m g. Subjects aged 40 to 65 years, inclusive, will cont inue to receive 
TAK -071 at a dose level o f 7.5 m g.
Change thesuggested study  entry  criteria for investigator assessment of fall history , cogni tive 
impairment, prior history of stable antiparkinsonian medication , and prior history  of deep brain 
stimulat ion (DBS )device implantation .
Prohibit use of acetylcho linesterase inhibitors administration during st udyand modify study  
entry  and use criteria for other m edicat ions and treatm ents.
Clarify visit window s for Study 
Visit days .
In thi s amendment, minor grammat ical, editorial, formatting, and administrative changes not 
affect ing the conduct of the study are included for clarification and administrative p urposes only,

continue to receive T AK-071 at a 
dose level of 7.5 mg. The 
TAK -071 dose level for this age 
group was specified as 7.5 mg 
(rather than ≤7.5 mg).PK, safety, and physiologically 
based PK modeling of data from 
the completed sentinel cohort 
allowed for expansion of the 
main cohort to include 
participants up to 85 years of 
age, inclusive. The modeling 
also provided justification for 
dose level specification by age.

Study Number: TAK -071-2002 Phase: 2
Study Design, Main Study:
This is a phase 2, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, 2 -period, 2 -treatment crossover study to evaluate the 
efficacy, safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics of TAK -071 when administered orally 
once daily (QD) in subjects with Parkinson disease (PD) and evidence of cognitive impairment who are at risk for falls
and who are not concurrently taking acetylcholinesterase inhibitors . In parallel with the main cohort, healthy subjects 
will participate in the sentinel cohort portion of the study as described below.
Approximately 64 male and female subjects, aged 40 to 85years, inclusive, will be enrolle d at up to 25 sites in the 
United States.
The main study will consist of a ≤6-week screening period, two 6 -week double -blind treatment periods separated by a 
≥3-week washout period, at -home assessments during the third week of each 6-week treatment period, and a safety 
follow -up call approximately 14 days after the last dose of study drug.
At the screening visit (Visit 1), subjects who provide informed consent will proceed with screening procedures. 
Subjects who meet a current diagnosis of PD, as defined by Movement Disorders Society (MDS) clinical diagnostic 
criteria for PD, will then be given additional assessments as specified in the schedule of study procedures.
On Day  1, subjects who continue to meet inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria will be randomized 1:1 to 
treatment with TAK -071 or placebo.
Subjects will receive TAK -071 or placebo QD from Day 1 through Day 42 of each period. Clinic visits include Day 1 
and Weeks 6, 9, and 15. Clinical assessments, blood collections, and laboratory tests wil l be conducted at specific time 
points per the schedule of study procedures.
A safety follow -up call will be conducted at Day 21, Day 84, and 14 days after completion of the last period.
The end of the study will be the date of the last visit of the last s ubject for safety follow -up, ie, the safety follow up call.

CONFIDENTIALStudy Design, Sentinel Cohort:
An initial sentinel cohort of healthy subjects will be enrolled at designated site(s), in parallel with enrollment of PD 
patients in the main cohort. Approximately 10 h ealthy subjects of either sex, aged 56 to 75 years , inclusive, will 
initially  be randomized 3:1 to TAK -071 7.5 mg versus placebo. Af teranaly sis of data from these subjects, additional 
subjects may be enrolled, including subjects over age 75. Enrollment of the sentinel cohort will conclude when 
sufficient data are available to characterize the PK in older subjects, as determined by the sp onsor.
Healthy  subjects will be selected on the basis of safety considerations. Of particular importance is exclusion on the 
basis of seizure risk factors, medical disease, and hepatic or renal impairment that may influence the PK of TAK -071.
Assessments f or healthy subjects will be limited to safety, tolerability, rich PK sampling, and samples for DNA 
(optional) and biomarkers.
After the PK, safety, and physiologically based PK modeling data from the sentinel cohort have been assessed, a 
decision will be made about the dose for the remaining subjects with PD to be enrolled in the main study. If older 
subjects are expected to remain below the exposure caps (potentially at a lower dose), they will also be enrolled. The 
maximum subject age and dose may be modi fied after analysis of data from the sentinel cohort. Update: At the 
completion of the sentinel cohort, based on PKmodeling, a decision was made by the sponsor to allow enrollment of 
subjects aged 66 to 85 years, inclusive, at a dose of 5 mg. The dose for subjects aged 40 to 65 years , inclusive, will 
continue to be 7.5mg.
The figure shows a schematic of the sentinel cohort (healthy subjects).
In unavoidable circumstances (eg, a widespread disease outbreak or natural disaster) that impact the ability to conduct 
study procedures according to the Schedule of Study Procedures, contingency measures may be implemented. The 
United States Food and Drug Administration issued guidance on the management of clinical trials during the 
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID -19) pandemic 
(fda.gov/regulatory -informatio n/search -fda-guidance -documents/fda -guidance -conduct -clinical -trials -medical -produ

designed as p recautio ns to ensure the rights, safety and wellbeing of study subjects during the COVID -19 pandemic 
have also been established. These restrictions may also prevent conduct of study procedures according to the Schedule 
of Study Procedures. Alternative appr oaches to study procedures and data collection for the current study are 
described.

Endpoints for Subjects With PD :
Primary Endpoint :
The primary endpoint for subjects with PD is the change from baseline in gait variability during a 2 -minute walk on a 
10-m eter walkway after 6 week treatment with TAK -071 compared with placebo.
Secondary Endpoints :
The secondary efficacy endpoint for subjects with PD is the change from baseline in a global cognition profile 
consisting of attention (Sustained Attention Test [S AT], Symbol Digit Modalities Test [SDMT]), executive function 
(Cogstate Groton Maze Learning Test, Cogstate One Back Test), and memory (Cogstate International Shopping List 
Test, Cogstate One Card Learning Test) after 6 week treatment with TAK -
071 compared with placebo.
The PK endpoints for subjects with PD are:
Observed concentration at the end of a dosing interval (Ctrough) of TAK -071 in subjects with PD (Day 42 of 
Period 1 and Period 2 only).
Maximum observed concentration (Cmax) and area under the conce ntration -time curve (AUC) of TAK -071 in 
subjects with PD.
Time of first occurrence of Cmax (tmax).
Safety Endpoints :
The safety endpoints for subjects with PD are:
Adverse events (AEs).
Clinical laboratory evaluations.
Electrocardiograms (ECGs).
Physical examinations.
Suicidal ideation and behavior as measured by the Columbia -Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS).

Statistical Considerations:
For subjects with PD , the primary outcome, the change from baseline in gait variability during a 2 -minute walk test, 
will be analyzed using a linear mixed effect model with a random factor for subject and fixed factors for treatment, 
period, and sequence. Baseline covariates will be included in the model as appropriate.
The effect of treatment on the overall cognitive battery will be analyzed using a linear mixed effects model with 
random effects for subjects for each cognitive test, fixed factors for treatment, test, period, and sequence. The 
comparison of the number of falls for placebo versus TAK -071 will be analyzed using a generalized linear mixed 
effect s model with a random factor for subjects, fixed factors for treatment, period, and sequence.
Drug effects on change from baseline for all endpoints will be assessed using 1 -sided tests. In all analyses the 
interaction terms and covariates will be added as appropriate.
For healthy subjects , analy sis will focus on PK (eg, Cmax, tmax, AUC inf, and AUC 24).
Sample Size Justification:
For subjects with PD , a sample size of 42 completers will be sufficient to detect a statistically significant (α = 0.05, 
1-sided) decrease in gait variability during walking for TAK -071 versus placebo. We expect to detect a minimum 
effect size of 0.32 (Cohen d) in the reduction of gait variability. For the sample size calculation, the study power was 
assumed to be 80%.
Given the pro posed study sample size and 80% power, a minimum detectable operational effect size for the cognitive 
battery  (α = 0.1, 1
-sided) will be 0.49. The correlations between cognitive tests are assumed to be 0.5. The minimum 
detectable (α = 0.1, 1 -sided) effect size in the number of falls will be approximately 0.3. For all calculations, the 
within -perso n correlatio n was assumed to be 0.65.
For healthy subjects (sentinel cohort), a sample size of approximately 10 subjects at a 3:1 ratio is considered to be 
likely  sufficient to adequately describe single -dose PK and safety.

CONFIDENTIAL4.0 INTRODUCTION
4.1 Background and Rationale
TAK -071 i s a first -in-class muscarinic M 1positive all osteri c modulator (M 1PAM) proposed for 
the reduction o f falls and improvement of cognit ion in Parkinson disease (PD).
4.1.1 Falls in PD
Falls are a commo n cause o f morbidity and m ortality  in pat ients with PD. The cause of falls is 
multifactorial and invo lves interactions between environmental, motor, and cognitive factors.
Multiple lines of evidence suggest that falls are in part a consequence of t he simultaneous loss of 
dopaminergic and cho linergic transmissio n associ ated with PD. PD is associated with a substantia l 
loss of cholinergi c fibers, which has been demonstrated using acet ylcho linesterase positron 
emissio n tom ography , as well as postm ortem histopathological analyses. Cortical cho linergic 
deficits are significant in early PD and are correlated with cognit ive decline in pat ients with PD 
and are more severe than in Alzheimer disease [1]. Modelling o f PD-related falls in animal models 
has demons trated that loss of striatal dopamine synergizes with cho linergic neuron loss in the basa l 
forebrain to impair gait and increase falls.
There i s clinical evidence that cholinergic drugs may  reduce fall ri sk in patients with PD. The 
largest published study to date (n =130, [
2]showed that rivastigmine re duced step time variabilit y, 
a correlate of fall risk, and the risk of falling was lowered by approximately 50% with 6 months of 
treatm ent. A sm aller study  (n=23, [3]) showed that donepezil, an acet ylcho linesterase inhibitor 
(AChEI), also reduced the risk of falls or near falls by approximately 50%. Li et al [4]studi ed 176 
Chinese pat ients with PD who were randomized to placebo or rivast igmine, another AChEI. 
Changes in cognit ion and fall incidenc e were compared between the 2 groups. Patients with mild 
cogni tive impairment (MCI) (odds ratio [OR]
=2.5) or dementia (OR =5.5) fell significant ly 
more than pat ients with intact cogni tion. Rivast igmine improved cognit ion and reduced the 
number of falls relative to placebo (OR =0.3). However, these studies suffer fro m significant 
methodol ogical flaws. A recent publicat ion [5]reported that donepezil did not improve balance in 
patients wi th PD.
Although these findings are so mewhat supportive regarding AChEIs, efficacy has not been 
concl usively  dem onstrated. TAK -071 can select ively activate M 1receptors without interfering 
with the tem poral  dynamics of ACh signaling, which plays a crit ical role in specific cognit ive 
funct ions such as attention. AChEIs in stead cause a tonic increase of ACh, with nonselect ive direct 
agonism at all muscarinic receptor subty pes while di srupt ing the temporal dynamics of ACh 
signaling, which is believed to cause adverse effects and may  obscure the procognit ive effects of 
M1receptor activat ion.

CONFIDENTIAL4.1.2 Cognitive Impairment in PD
Most patients with PD will develop dement ia, either at least 1 y ear after the onset of motor 
symptoms (termed Parkinson disease dement ia [PDD]) or less than 1 year after the onset of motor 
symptoms (termed demen tia with Lewy  body [DLB]). The term  Lewy  body dement ia (LBD) 
enco mpasses both PDD and DLB. Current ly, many experts in the field believe that there are few 
fundamental bio logical  differences between these condit ions and the term LBD will, therefore, be 
used here.
LBD has a major impact on funct ioning, cost of care, and qualit y of life. Before the development 
of LBD, pati ents ini tially experience MCI. In addi tion to the di rect impact on funct ioning, 
cogni tive impairment in patients with PD also significant ly increases the risk for falls as described 
above.
Patients with PD show early and marked degenerat ion of the cho linergic system including a loss of 
cholinergic fibers fro m the nucleus basalis of Meynert (NBM), which mainly supplies the cortex, 
and the peduncul opontine nucleus, which mainly supplies the basal ganglia, thalamus, brainstem, 
and rostral spinal cord. The degenerat ion of the NBM in particular is strongly related to cognit ive 
impairment in PD. As noted in Section 4.1.4 , nonclinical data from NBM -lesioned rats is 
supportive of potential efficacy with respect to cognit ive impairment.
TAK -071 coul d be valuable in the treatment of patients with PD through reducing fall risk and/or 
improving cognit ion, both unmet needs for patients. Therefore, the present study  will evaluate 
both.
4.1.3 Impairments in Speech in PD
Speech difficult ies occur in up to 90% of patients with PD over the course of the disease and 
significant ly affect their social interact ions and qualit y of life. Speech impairment in PD is likely 
the resul t of the combined effect of impaired motor control and cognit ive deficit s. In PD, a 
reducti on in dopamine is associated with the cardinal motor symptoms of trem or, sl owness of 
movement (brady kinesia) and m uscle ri gidity (stiffness). However, dopamine replacement 
therapy  showed inconsistent effects on speech performance, suggest ing the contribution o f 
alternat ive neurotransmitters during speech processing. The voc al apparatus is under motor contro l 
and is therefore impacted by  the l oss of cholinergic projections observed in PD. Moreover, 
previous studies reported language processing deficits are associated with cognit ive dysfunct ion in 
PD [6]. The rol e of the cho linergic s ystem  in cogniti on has been well established. Therefore, it is 
plausible that TAK -071, through enhancing cho linergic funct ion, will improve both motor control 
and cognit ive funct ion in pat ients with PD, and consequent ially speech funct ion. Analysis of 
spee
ch in pat ients with PD will provide data that are complementary  to m easures of walking and 
other complex motor tasks.
4.1.4 Nonclinical Data
Nonclinical studies suggest that TAK -071 m ay improve cognit ive performance including working 
memory , recogni tion mem ory, and attenti on.
TAK -071
Study No. TAK -071-2002 Page 26of 125
Protocol Incorporating Amendment No. 4 07September 2021
CONFIDENTIALIn Y-maze and the novel object recognit ion tests, TAK- 071 improved working memory  defici ts 
and recognit ion memory , respect ively, at 0.1 and 0.3 mg/kg in miR -137 Tg mice.
The neural act ivation pattern of TAK -071 m easured by c -fos mapping in rodents was very similar 
to that of xano meline, an M 1/M4agonist that previously showed efficacy  for cogni tion in AD and 
schizophrenia but was limited by adverse events (AEs), while donepezil was not effective in this 
assay.
TAK -071 al so significant ly impr oved attenti onal function (m easured by the Sustained Attention 
Test [SAT]) in rats with partial basal forebrain cholinergic lesio ns at doses as low as 0.1 mg/kg, a 
model where AChEIs are ineffective [7]. These findings are highly significant because the lesio ns 
in this model mirror the loss of cho linergic fibers in PD and because performance on this task is 
correl ated with gait abnormalit ies and falls in a rat model of PD [
8,9]. These data strong ly support 
the potenti al of TAK -071 f or falls and cognit ive impairment in PD, as well as its different iation 
from AChEIs.
Overall, these data suggest that TAK -071 is a promising therapy for cognit ive impairment and falls 
in PD, and these data also provide important insights regarding different iation from exist ing 
cholinergic therapies.
4.1.5 Differentiation From AChEIs and Other M 1PAMs
There i s a strong scient ific basis for the notion that M 1PAMs may be superior to AChEIs for falls 
and cognit ion. It has been established that ACh signals through slow “tonic” release as well as fast 
“phasic” release. Phasic ACh plays a crit ical ro le in the modulat ion of attention and other frontal 
cogni tive functions that m ay be critical for cogni tive gait control. AChEIs chronically elevate 
synaptic ACh levels, which may impair phasic signaling, whereas M1PAMs such as TAK -071 do 
not disrupt these temporal dynamics and support phasic signaling.
Previous nonclin ical evidence has strongly supported the synergist ic effect of cho linergic lesio ns 
on dopaminergic deficits in falls in a rat model of PD [
7]. Rats with dual cho linergic -dopa minergic 
lesions have clearly shown more frequent falls than rats with eit her cho linergic or dopaminergic 
lesions. Moreover, the attention performance and falls were only correlated in these animals wit h 
dual lesions. Therefore, enhancement of cholinergic function may have a posit ive impact not only 
on cogni tion, but al so falls in PD. Whereas AChEIs are ineffect ive in this dual -lesio n model, 
TAK -071 si gnificant ly improves attentional performance, which strongly supports the predict ion 
that TAK -071 can suppo rt phasic ACh signaling to improve cognit ion, and by inference cognit ive 
control  of gait.
TAK -071 has di stinct pharmaco logy from other M 1PAMs. For example, Merck’s select ive M 1
PAM MK -7622 has a higher binding cooperativit y (α-value: 511, where α is the f old increase of 
ACh affinit y for its binding si te due to the effects of the PAM) than TAK -071 (α -value: 199). 
Higher binding cooperativit y has been shown to be strongly related to poor gastrointestinal 
tolerabilit y in nonclinical studies [
10]. TAK -071, but not MK -7622, showed synergy  with 
donepezil in the scopolamine -induced cognit ive deficit model. Taken together wi th other 
nonclinical studies co mpar ing these drugs, these data strongly  suggest that TAK -071 affects 
receptor si gnaling different ly from MK-7622 and has di stinct in vivo pharmaco logy.

CONFIDENTIAL4.2 Benefit/Risk Profile
TAK -071 is a highly select ive cho linergic muscarinic M 1receptor PAM. Nonclinical data indicate 
that cortical cho linergic deficits are associated with cognit ive decline and falls in PD models, and 
clinical studies suggest that cholinergic drugs may reduce fall risk in pat ients withPD. There is 
therefore a scient ific rationale for exploring the potent ial of TAK -071 to improve cognit ive 
funct ion and decrease falls in patients with PD. However, clinical benefit of TAK -071 has not been 
established because the product has only been test ed in phase 1 studies in healt hy subjects.
Nonclinical toxico logy studi es showed convulsio ns in rats and monkeys and neurotoxicit y in rats 
at high doses. Consequent ly, clinical doses are limited to those expected to result in plasma 
TAK -071 exposures of no more than 600 ng/mL and 14,000 h*ng/mL for maximum observed 
concentration (C max) and area under the concentration -time curve fro m time 0 to 24 hours (AUC 24), 
respectively . This allows up to a 7.5 mg once daily (QD) clinical dose. After 7.5 mg QD doses, th e 
projected maximum observed concentration at steady  state (C max,ss) and area under the 
concentration -time curve fro m time 0 to 24 hours at steady  state (AUC 24,ss) are 549 ng/mL and 
12,900 h*ng/mL, respect ively, in subjects 18 to 55 years old, within the e xposure limits. In 
addition, TAK -071 must not be coadministered with an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor ( eg, 
donepezil , rivastigmine, galantamine )because of th epotential to cause convulsions based on 
data from nonclinical toxicology studies .
In phase 1 clinical studies, a total of 139 healt hy subjects 18 to 55 y ears ol dhave received at least 
1 dose of TAK -071. There were no SAEs or deaths reported. Review of all available clinical safet y 
data indicates that TAK -071 is generally safe and well tolerated.
Inform ation from the co mpleted phase 1 studies, together with the nonclinical toxicit y studies in 
rats and monkeys, indicates that the benefit -risk balance for TAK -071 is deemed acceptable at the 
proposed dose of 7.5 mg. Clinical dosing of TAK -071 with donepezil and other AChEIs is not 
supported.
Please see the investigator’s brochure for more details regarding the safet y profile o f TAK -
071.
Exploratory  biomarker analysis, including DNA, plasma, cerebrospinal fluid, and exosome protein 
and nuclei c acid analysis may  be conducted to investigate the contribut ion of genet ic and other 
biological  factor vari ance on drug response, for example, its efficacy  and safet y.

6.2 Conti ngency Measures Due to COVID -19 Pandemic or Other Unavoidable 
Circumstances
This sect ion applies to all study  subjects.
In unavo idable circumstances (eg, a widespread disease outbreak or natural disaster) that impact 
the abilit y to conduct study  procedures according to the schedule of study  procedures 
(Appendix A), contingency measures may be implemented. In March 2020, the United States 
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued guidance on the management of clinical trials during 
the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID -19) pandemic 
(fda.gov/regulatory -informat ion/search -fda-guidance -docum ents/fda -guidance -conduct -clinical -t
rials-medical -products -during -covid-19- public -healt h-emergency . Accessed 12 June 2020). 
Hospital, local, state and national restrict ions designed as precaut ions to ensure the rights, safet y 
and wellbeing of study subjects during the COVID -19 pandemic have also been established. These 
restri ctions may also pr event conduct of study procedures according to the Schedule of Procedures. 
Alternat ive approaches to study procedures and data collect ion for the current study are described 
in Section 9.1.24 .
6.3 Justification for Study Design, Endpoints, and Dose
This sect ion applies to the main study  (subjects wi th PD).
6.3.1 Subject Selection Considerations
Consistent with our focus on fall prevent ion, we are selecting subjects with PD who are at elevated 
risk of falling based on a history o f falls. On the other hand, subjects who are at advanced stages of 
PD will not be able to complete gait assessments. Sub jects with Hoehn and Yahr stage ≥2 and <4 
will, therefore, be selected for this study  to ensure that PD severit y is significant but not to the 
extent that the gait assessments beco me impossible. Furthermore, cognit ive impairment is a risk 
factor for falls, and i t is important to sel ect subjects with sufficient cognitive impairment to avoid 
ceiling effects so that efficacy  for cogni tion and improvem ent of gai t via effects on cogni tion can 
be observed. On the other hand, very  significant cognitive impairment will make fo llowing 
instructi ons and com pleting assessments difficult. Given these considerations, s ubjects who score 
between 11 and 26 on the Montreal Cognit ive Assessment (MoCA) and who complete the 
cogni tion assessments at screening will therefore be se lected.
TAK -071
Study No. TAK -071-2002 Page 34of 125
Protocol Incorporating Amendment No. 4 07September 2021
CONFIDENTIAL6.3.2 Justification for Digital Endpoints
Fall risk is correlated with several aspects of gait, including gait variabilit y measured using stride 
and step time variabilit y. Stride and step time variabilit y are vari ables that can be measured with 
high prec ision using digital gait assessments in the clinic and arebelieved to reflect cognitive gait 
control ; gait vari abilityis a more appropriate primary  endpoint for sm all initial patient studies, 
such as the present study , than actual  falls.
The wearable pen dant sensor generates 2 endpoints, in -home act ivity and number of falls. In -home 
activit y is measured by calculat ing the number of steps taken by the pat ient every  15minutes 
throughout the day  from the raw sensor data. Hourly , daily , and weekly act ivity is then calculated 
from this step count data. Number of falls is measured using a proprietary algorithm to detect a fall 
from the raw sensor data. If a fall is detected, the time stamp of the fall is recorded and transmitted 
immediately , and the raw sensor data before and after the fall is saved locally on the device for 
offline analysis. Daily, weekly, and monthly number of falls are then calculated on the basis of the 
time- stam ped falls.
6.3.3 Dose Justification
TAK -071 has been tested in human phase 1 clinical studi es in heal thy subjects 18 to 55 y ears ol d 
(197 subjects total, 139 dosed with TAK -071). Aft er single (1 to 160 mg) and mult iple (3 to 15 mg 
QD) oral doses of TAK- 071, systemic exposure (C maxand AUC) to TAK -071 increased in only a 
slight ly less than d ose proporti onal manner. TAK -071 dem onstrated a l ong half -life of 46 to 
61hours and reasonable brain penetration after oral dose. TAK -071 was well tol erated, wi th no 
deaths or SAEs. There was 1 discontinuation due to headache and 1 severe treatment -emergent 
adverse event (TEAE) of syncope. Both subjects were on TAK -071 and the AEs reso lved. No 
clinical concerns were raised by laboratory  tests, ECG, physical examinat ion, or bowel funct ion 
assessment.
The simulated exposure predict ions for a 7.5 m g QD dose i n humans, which is the dose proposed 
for this study  in PD, yield a C minexposure (ie, 432 ng/mL) that is 6.0- fold the rat C maxexposure at 
0.1 m g/kg (i e, 72 ng/mL), the predicted efficacious dose from the cholinergic lesio n model. 
Therefore, there is ample margin to test the efficacy o f TAK -071 in humans.
The subjects selected for this study are older than those in phase 1 clinical studies, 40 to 85years, 
inclusive ,versus 18 to 55 years, inclusive. The potent ial exposure difference was assessed through 
an initial preliminary physi ologically  based PK (PBPK) modeling of phase 1 PK data using 
SimCyp Simulator, and the model project ion indicated an increase of less than 25% in mean 
exposure measures (C maxand AUC) for a 7.5 mg QD dose for older subjects of 4 0 to 75 y ears, 
inclusive, versus subjects of 18 to 55 y ears, inclusive. For subjects aged 40 to 75 years, inclusive, 
SimCyp simulations predict a geometric mean C max,ssof 580 ng/mL and a geometric mean 
AUC 24,ssof 11,100 hr*ng/mL. Higher exposure was achi eved by  multiple doses of up to 15 mg in 
the phase 1 clinical studies and was determined to be safe and well tolerated.
To study  the age effect and ensure safet y for older subjects, an init ial small sent inel cohort of 
healt hy subjects aged 56 to 75 years , inclusive ,was enro lled with rich PK sampling after a single 
dose ( at designated site[s]; see Appendix H). The PBPK model developed fro m the sent inel cohort

CONFIDENTIALdata suggest that subj ects 40 to 65 y ears can continue to receive TAK -071 7.5 m g QD. A l ower 
dose of TAK -071 5 mg QD is reco mmended for subjects 66 to 85 years to keep the exposure under 
the exposure cap, ie, 600 ng/mL for C max,ss and 14,000 hr*ng/mL for AUC 24,ss. Bas ed on these 
resul ts, a decisio n was made to expand the main cohort to include subjects with PD aged 66 to 85 
years, inclusive, at a dose of 5 mg. Of note, the PBPK modeling projections of geometric mean 
Cmax,ssand AUC 24,ssare bel ow the exposure caps. For subjects aged 40 to 65 y ears, inclusive, the 
projections of geo metric m ean C max,ssand AUC 24,ssat a dose of 7.5 mg are 586 ng/mL and 
11,663 hr*ng/mL, respectively. For subjects aged 66 to 85 years, inclusive, the project ions of 
geom etric mean C max,ssandAUC 24,ssat a dose of 5 mg for TAK -071 are 556 ng/mL and 11,624 
hr*ng/mL, respectively .
After the PK, safet y, and physio logically  based PK m odeling data from  the sent inel cohort have 
been assessed, a decisio n will be made about the dose for the remain ing subjects with PD to be 
enrolled. If older subjects are expected to remain below the exposure caps, they will also be 
enrolled. The maximum subject age and dose may be modified after analysis o f data from  the 
sentinel cohort.

This sect ion applies to all subject s.
The primary  reason for di scont inuat ion or wi thdrawal  of the subject from  the study  or study drug 
shoul d be recorded in the electronic case report form (eCRF) using the following categories. For 
screen failure subjects, refer to Section 9.1.22 .
1.Pretreatment event (PTE) or AE. The subject has experienced a PTE or AE that requires early 
termination because cont inued participat ion imposes an unacceptable risk to the subject’s 
healt h, or the subject is unwilling to con tinue because of the PTE or AE.
Liver function test (LFT) abnormalit ies. Study  drug shoul d be di scontinued immediately  
with appropri ate clinical fo llow-up (including repeat laboratory  tests, until a subje ct’s 
laboratory  profile has returned to normal/baseline status), if the following circumstances 
occur at any  time during study drug treatment:
–ALT or AST >8 × ULN, or
–ALT or AST >5 × ULN and persists for more than 2 weeks, or
–ALT or AST >3 × ULN in conjunc tion wi th elevated total  bilirubin >2 × ULN or 
INR >1.5, or
–ALT or AST >3 × ULN with appearance of fat igue, nausea, vo miting, right upper 
quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, rash and/or eosinophilia (>5%).
Subject experiences any of the Takeda Medically  Significant List events (see 
Secti on10.1.4 ).
2.Significant protocol deviat ion. The discovery postrando mizat ion that the subject failed to meet  
protocol  entry criteria or di d not adhere to protocol requirements, or continued participat ion 
poses an unacceptable risk to the subject’s health.
3.Lost to follow -up. The subject did not return to the clinic and attempts to contact the subject 
were unsuccessful. Atte mpts to contact the subject must be documented in the subject’s source 
docum ents.
4.Voluntary  withdrawal. The subject (or subject’s legally  acceptable representative) wishes to 
withdraw from  the study . The reason for withdrawal, if provided, should be recorded in the 
eCRF.
Note: All attempts should be made to determine the underlying reason for the withdrawal and, 
where possible, the primary  underlying reason should be recorded (ie, withdrawal due to an 
AE should not be recorded in the “voluntary  withdrawal ” category ).

Note: If the subject is found to be pregnant, the subject must be withdrawn immediately. The 
procedure is described in Sect ion 9.1.14 .
6.Study  terminat ion by the sponsor.
7.Study  terminat ion by the IRB or regulatory  agency.
8.Other.
Note: The specific reasons should be recorded in the “specify” field of the eCRF.
7.6 Procedures for Discontinuation or Withdrawal of a Su bject
This sect ion applies to all subjects.
The invest igator may discont inue a subject’s study participat ion at any t ime during the study when 
the subject meets the study termination criteria described in Section 7.5. In addition, a subject may 
discontinue his or her participat ion without giving a reason at any  time during the study . Shoul d a 
subject’s participat ion be di scontinued, the primary  criterion for terminat ion must be recorded by  
the invest igator. In addit ion, efforts should be made to perform all procedures scheduled for the 
early  terminat ion visit. Discont inued or withdrawn subjects may be replaced.
If a subject discont inues from the study , a repl acement s ubject may  be enrolled, if deemed 
appropriate by  the investi gator and sponsor. The study  site shoul d contact the interactive web 
response system (IWRS) for the replacement subject’s treatment assignment and study number.

specified on the label, and remain in the original container unt il dispensed. A daily temperature log 
of the drug storage area must be maintained every  working day . Refer to pharm acy manual for 
additional storage -and return -related instructions and informat ion.
8.1.3 Dose and Regimen
For the subjects with PD only: subjects who meet rando mizat ion criteria on Day  1 will be 
rando mized to 1 of 2 treatment sequences consist ing of daily treatm ent wi th 7.5mg TAK -071 or 
placebo. Subjects will receive 7.5 mg TAK -071 or placebo dosed QD fro m Day 1 through Day 42 
of each peri od.
After the PK, safet y, and physio logically  based PK m odeling data from  the sent inel cohort 
(healt hy subjects) have been assessed (see Appendix H), a decisio n will be made about the dose for 
the rem aining subjects with PD to be enrolled in the main study . If older subjects are expected to 
remain below the exposure ca ps, they  will also be enrolled. The m aximum  subject age and dose 
may be modified after analysis o f data from  the sent inel cohort.
8.1.4 Overdose
An overdose is defined as a known deliberate or accidental administration of study drug, to or by a 
study  subject, at a dose above that which is assigned to that individual subject according to the 
study  protocol .
All cases of overdose (with or without associated AEs) will be documented on the eCRF, to 
capture this important safet y informat ion consistently  in the databas e. Cases of overdose without 
manifested signs or symptoms are not considered AEs. AEs associated with an overdose will be

Protocol Incorporating Amendment No. 4 07September 2021
CONFIDENTIALSubjects with PD aged 40 to 85years , inclusive, will be enro lled in the main study , with 1:1 
rando mizat ion to 7.5 m g TAK -071 QD versus placebo, in sequences of 4 .
For the main study , subjects wi th PD will be randomized to 1 of 2 possible treatment sequences 
consist ing of 2 periods and 2 treatm ents, al ternat ing in a crossov er fashio n:
Subjects rando mized to Sequence A will receive TAK -071 in the first 6 -week period and 
crossover to placebo in the second 6 -week peri od.
Subjects rando mized to Sequence B will receive placebo in the first 6- week period and 
crossover to TAK -071 i n the second 6 -week peri od.
The invest igator or the invest igator’s designee will access IWRS at screening to obtain the subject 
study  number . The invest igator or the invest igator’s designee will use the IWRS to randomize the 
subject into the study . During this contact, the investigator or designee will provide the necessary  
subject -ident ifying informat ion, including the subject number assigned at screening. The 
medicat ion identificat ion (ID) number of the study drug to be dispensed will then be provided by 
the IWRS. If the sponsor -supplied drug is lo st or damaged, the site can request a replacement fro m 
IWRS. (Refer to IWRS manual provided separately.) The tear -off porti on of  the m edicat ion label 
will be affixed to the Dispensing Log. At subsequent drug -dispensing visit s, the investigator or 
designee will again access IWRS to request addit ional study  drug for a subject.
8.3 Randomization Code Creation and Storage
The IWRS system will generate the randomization schedule. All randomizat ion informat ion will 
be store d in a secured area, accessible only by authorized personnel.
8.4 Study Drug Blind Maintenance
The study  drug blind will be maintained using the IWRS.
Since the maintenance of the blind may be co mpromised because of results fro m drug 
concentrations and/or pharmacodynamics assessments, such results should not be disclo sed before 
blind breaking. In the event that results must be reported to the investigator before breaking the 
blind, all efforts should be made to maintain the blind (eg, as changing a medicat ion ID number to 
avoid identificat ion of subjects by the laboratory site personnel). Detailed procedures for 
measuring subject drug concentration levels, (including reporting results) are provided in the 
separately  created procedure for direct ions on handli ng of  biological samples for m easuring drug 
concentrations.
8.5 Unblinding Procedure
The study  drug blind shall not be broken by  the investi gator unl ess inform ation concerning the 
study  drug i s necessary for the medical treatment of the subject. All study  asse ssments and 
causalit y assessment should be performed, if possible, before unblinding. In the event of a medica l 
emergency, if possible, the medical mo nitor should be contacted before the study  drug blind is 
broken to di scuss the need for unblinding.

Protocol Incorporating Amendment No. 4 07September 2021
CONFIDENTIALFor un blinding a subject, the study drug blind can be obtained by the invest igator, by accessing the 
IWRS.
The sponsor must be notified as soon as possible if the study drug blind is broken. The date, time, 
and reason the blind is broken must be recorded in the source documents and the same informat ion 
(except the time) must be recorded on the eCRF.
If any site personnel are unblinded, study drug must be stopped immediately and the subject must 
be wit hdrawn fro m the study .
8.6 Accountability and Destruction of Sponsor- Supplied Drugs
Drug supplies will be counted and reconciled at the site before being returned to the sponsor or 
designee for destruction. Destruction at site will be permitted if/when a Standard Operating 
Procedure exists after requesting and receiving s ponsor’s approval.
The investigator or designee must ensure that the sponsor -supplied drug is used in accordance wit h 
the protocol and is dispensed only to subjects enro lled in the study ,
The invest igator or designee must maintain 100% accountabilit y for all sponsor -supplied drugs 
received and dispensed during his or her entire participat ion in the study . Proper drug 
accountabilit y includes, but is not limit ed to:
Frequent ly verifying that actual inventory  matches docum ented inventory .
Verifying that the lo g is completed for the medicatio n ID used to prepare each dose.
Verifying that all containers used are documented accurately on the log.
Verifying that required fields are co mpleted accurately and legibly.
A site representative or unblinded pharmacy monit or, otherwise uninvo lved wit h study  
conduct, will review the randomization schedule and subject dosing log before Day 1 dosing 
and after dosing to ensure all subjects received the correct dose of study  drug,
Filing all study  medicati on docum entati on in the investigator’s essent ial document file.
If any dispensing errors or discrepancies are discovered, the sponsor must be notified immediately.

CONFIDENTIAL9.1.1 Informed Consent Procedure
The requi rements of the informed consent are described in Sect ion 15.2.
Inform ed consent m ust be obtained before the subject entering into the study , and before any 
protocol -directed procedures are performed.
A unique screening ID number will be generated by the IWRS and assigned to each subject after 
inform ed consent i s signed and the site regi sters the subject in the IWRS; this ID number will be 
used throughout the study .
9.1.1.1 DNA Analysis Informed Consent Procedure
A separate informed consent form pertaining to collect ion, storage, and analysis of the sample 
must be obtained before collec ting a bl ood sam ple for DNA analysis research for this study . The 
provi sion of consent to collect and analyze the sample for DNA analysis is independent of consent 
to the other aspects of the study . Provi ding a DNA sample is optional for this study .
9.1.2 Demogr aphics, Medical History, and Medication History Procedure
Dem ographic information to be obtained will include date of birth, sex, Hispanic ethnicit y, race as 
described by the subject, height, weight, and smoking status of the subject at screening.
Medical history  to be obtained will include determining whether the subject has any  significant 
condi tions or di seases rel evant to the di sease under study  that resolved at or before signing of 
inform ed consent. Ongoing condit ions are considered concurrent medical condi tions (see 
Secti on9.1.10 ).
In addit ion, informat ion on the subject’s PD history including symptoms and disease 
characterist ics and history  of falls over the past 6 mo nths will be co llected.
Medicat ion history  informat ion to be obtained includes any medicat ion relevant to eligibilit y 
criteria stopped at or within 30 days before signing of informed consent.
9.1.3 Physical Examination Procedure
At screening and both baseline visits, a physical examinat ion (defined as the assessment before 
first dose of study  drug) will be conducted consisting of the fo llowing body  systems: (1) ey es; (2) 
ears, nose, throat; (3) cardiovascular system; (4) respiratory  system ; (5) gastrointest inal system; 
(6)dermatologic system; (7) extremit ies; (8) musculoskeletal  system; (9) lymph nodes; and 
(10) other.
At the l ast vi sit of each peri od, (11) nervous system will be added to the examinat ion.

CONFIDENTIAL9.1.4 Neurological Examination Procedure
A separate neuro logical examinat ion will  be performed and collected in the eCRF. This will 
include testing mental status, gait, cerebellar funct ion, cranial nerves, upper and lower extremit y 
motor strength, reflexes, and sensat ion.
9.1.5 Weight, Height, and BMI
A subject should have weight and height measured while wearing indoor clothing and with shoes 
off. The BMI is calculated using metric units with the formula provided below. Height is recorded 
in centimeters without decimal places. Weight is collected in kilograms (kg) with 1 decimal place. 
BMI should be derived as:
Metri c: BMI = wei ght (kg)/height (m)2
Note that although hei ght is reported in centimeters, the formula uses meters for height; meters can 
be determined from cent imeters by dividing by 100. Thus, for example, if height =176 cm 
(1.76 meters) and weight =79.2 kg, then BMI =79.2/1.762=25.56818 kg/m2.
The values s hould be reported to 1 decimal place by  rounding. Thus, in the above example BMI 
woul d be reported as 25.6 kg/m2. Because the BMI is used as an exclusio n criterion thi s 
determinat ion must be made after rounding.
9.1.6 Vital Sign Procedure
The invest igator will r eview all vital signs for real -time safet y monitoring purposes. Vi tal signs 
will include body temperature (oral measurement), respi ratory  rate, supine blood pressure (systolic 
and diastolic, after lying down at least 5 minutes), supine pulse (beats per min ute), standing blood 
pressure and pulse (systolic and diastolic blood pressure and pulse, measured within 1 minute after 
standing after supine measurements are taken).
When vital signs are scheduled at the same t ime as blood draws, the blood draw will take priority 
and vital signs will be obtained wit hin 0.5 hour before or after the scheduled blood draw.
9.1.7 MoCA (Subjects With PD Only)
The MoCA is a cognit ive screening examinat ion designed to screen for MCI [11]. This 30 -point 
test assesses 8 cognit ive domains: attention and concentration, execut ive functions, memory , 
language, visuoconstru ctional skills, conceptual thinking, calculat ions, and ori entati on.
9.1.8 Pharmacodynamic Measurements
In the case of subjects with PD, a ll in-clinic assessments are to be performed during the subject’s 
On state after taking dopaminergic therapy. Assessments sho uld be made within approximately the 
same time after a patient has taken their dopaminergic medicat ion.
Please refer al so to the study  manual  for the order in which gait and cognit ive assessments should 
be perform ed.

This will be documented in the study  records.
9.1.8.1 Pharmacodynamic Measurements Related to Gait
This section applies only to the main study (subjects with PD).
9.1.8.1.1 Walk and Serial Subtraction Tests
Serial subtracti on test. 
Serial subtraction tests are commo nly used to measure attention and mental concentration [12]. 
Subjects in this study  will perform a serial  subtracti on 3 test while sitting in a chai r. Subjects 
will not be corrected during this testing. The total number of correct and incorrect numbers will 
be recorded.
2-minute walk (with cognit ive load).
Subjects will be asked to walk at a self
-selected comfortable pace back and forth along a 
10-meter long hallway for 2 minutes while conducting a serial subtraction 3 test. Subjects will 
complete turns at both ends of the hallway. Verbal reminders will be provided if subjects stop 
counting before complet ing the full 2 -minute walk test. The total numbe r of correct and 
incorrect numbers during subtraction will be recorded.
2-minute walk (no cognit ive load).
Subjects will be asked to walk at a self
-selected comfortable pace back and forth along a 
10-meter long hallway for 2 minutes. Subjects will complete turns at both ends of the hallway.
9.1.8.1.2 Cued 180° Turns
Subjects will be asked to walk at a self
-selected comfortable pace back and forth along a 
10-meter-long hallway . At random  times during their walk, the subjects will receive a verbal 
instructi on to turn 1 80 degrees in a specific direct
ion (left or right). After the turn, subjects will 
continue walking unt il they receive another instruction to turn. The total number of correct turns 
(turning in the direct ion instructed) will be recorded.
9.1.8.1.3 MDS -UPDRS Including Hoehn and Yahr Scale
MDS -UPDRS consists of 4 parts evaluat ing various aspects of PD through 65 items [13]. Part I 
evaluates nonmotor experiences of daily living and Part II evaluates motor experie nces of daily 
living. Part III includes a set of motor examinat ions conducted by  a clinician. Part IV assesses 
motor com plicat ions. Rater time for administrating the MDS -UPDRS i s estimated to be 
approximately  30 minutes [14]. The Hoehn and Yahr scale is a 5 -stage, descript ive ordinal scale 
that provides a general est imate of clinical aspects including objective signs (impairment) and 
funct ional deficits (disabilit y) in PD [15]. Note that for this study  the standard versio n rather than 
the modified versi on will be used.
TAK -071

CONFIDENTIALThe scale will be evaluated by a clinician. The same rater should rate a subject on each visit during 
the course of the stu dy. Of note, the dist inction between stages 3 and stage 4 should be made in part 
based on whether the subject is too disabled to live alone. Subjects who cannot live independent ly 
shoul d be rated as stage 4 or 5 ( https://www.parkinson.org/Understanding -

Subjects will be asked to complete tasks assessing various aspects of speech and language, 
including speech t iming, vo ice qualit y, vocal control , breath support, sentence co mplexity, and 
idea densit y. Details will be available in the study  manual.
9.1.8.1.6 TUG
Subjects will be asked to complete the standard TUG. Subjects will begin the test sitting in a chair. 
Subjects will then stand up fro m the chair, walk 3 meters as quickly and safely as possible, cross a 
line marked on the floor, turn around, walk back, and sit down again in the chair. This test will be 
repeated 3 times (only  once at screening).

This section applies only to the main study (subjects with PD) .
Please refer to the Cogstate and Operation manuals for addit ional details on these assessments.
9.1.8.2.1 Cogstate International Shopping List Test
The Internat ional Shopping List test is a measure of verbal learning and memory and uses a 
well-validated li st-learning paradigm. High -frequency, high -imagery , concrete nouns (items from 
a shopping list) are read to the subject by the test supervisor at the rate of 1 word every 2 seconds. 
Once all 12 words have been read, the subject is asked to recall as many o f the words as he/she can 
as qui ckly as possible. The test supervisor records the words recalled by  the subject on the testing 
device. When the subject can recall no more words, the same list is read a second time. The test 
supervisor records the words rec alled by the subject on this trial. This is then repeated a third time. 
Delayed recall condit ion is also available for this test. The delayed recall condit ion requires the 
subject to recall the words from the list 10 to 30 minutes later without having the list read again. 
The software measures the number of correct responses as recorded by the test supervisor. It takes 
approximately  5 minutes to com plete this test.

The m odified Chase test i s administered prior to the first admin istrati on of  the m odified Groton 
Maze Learning test (screening visit) for addit ional subject familiarizat ion. Subjects are required to 
“chase” a moving box around the grid for about 30 seconds, moving 1 box at a time wit hout 
skipping boxes.
9.1.8.2.3 Cogstate Modifi ed Groton Maze Learning Test
Modified Groton Maze Learning Test: The task begins wit h a chase task to allow subjects to 
beco me familiar with the task context. The subjects are shown a 10 × 10 grid of tiles on a computer 
touch screen. The subjects are instr ucted to ‘chase’ a moving tile around the grid. Once they 
understand the rules, they  can proceed onto the timed chase test, where they  must chase the target 
for 30 seconds. For the test, the subject is shown the same 10 × 10 grid of tiles on a computer touch 
screen. A 28- step pathway  is hidden amo ng these 100 possible locat ions. The start is indicated by 
the blue tile at the top left and the finish location is the tile with the red circles at the bottom right of 
the grid. The subjects are instructed to move 1 step from  the start l ocati on and then to conti nue, 1 
tile at a time, toward the end (bottom right). The subjects move by  touching a tile next to their 
current l ocati on wi th the st ylus. After each move is made, the computer indicates whether this is 
correct by  revealing a green checkmark (ie, this is the next step in the pathway ), or incorrect by  
revealing a red cross (ie, this is not the next step in the pathway, or the subject has broken a rule, 
see below). If the cho ice was correct, the step in the pat hway remains highlighted and the subjects 
must l ocate the next step in the pathway . If a cho ice was incorrect (ie, a red cross is revealed), the 
subjects must touch the last correct location (ie, the last green checkmark revealed) and then make 
a different tile choice to advance toward the end. While mo ving through the hidden maze, the 
subjects are required to adhere to 2 rules. First, the subjects cannot move diagonally or touch the 
same tile twice in successio n. Second, the subjects cannot move backwards along the pathway (eg, 
move back to a location that displa yed a green t ick, but from which they have since mo ved). If the 
subjects choose a tile that is not part of the hidden pathway , but the tile choi ce is wi thin the rul es, 
this is recorded as a differen t type of  error (eg, n ot a rul e break). Thi s coul d be due to chance (the 
first time through the m aze) or due to misremembering the path on subsequent attempts. The 
subjects learn the 28 -step pathway  through the m aze on the basis of this trial and error fee dback. 
Once co mpleted, the pathway of correct responses marked on the grid is ext inguished and subjects 
are instructed to return to the start location and find the same pathway again. The process continues 
until subjects have co mpleted 5 trials in total. T here are 20 well -matched alternate forms for this 
task, and these are selected in pseudo -rando m order to ensure that no subject will co mplete the 
same hidden path unt il all 20 have been completed.
9.1.8.2.4 Cogstate One Card Learning Test
The One Card Learning test is a measure of visual learning and uses a well -validated pattern 
separation paradigm wit h playing card stimuli. In this test, the playing cards are ident ical to those

response. It takes approximately 6 minutes to complete th is test.
9.1.8.2.5 Cogstate One Back Test
The One Back test is a measure of working memory  and uses a well -validated n -back paradigm 
with playing card st imuli. In this test, the playing cards are ident ical to those found in a standard 
deck of 52 playing cards (witho ut the joker cards). The subject is asked whether the card displayed 
in the center of the screen is the same as the card presented immediately previously. The subject 
responds by pressing the Yes or No key. Because no card has been presented yet on the first trial, a 
correct first response is always No. The software measures the speed and accuracy o f each 
response. It takes approximately 4 minutes to complete this test.
9.1.8.2.6 SDMT (Oral Version)
The oral versio n of the SDMT is administered by providing the subject with a sheet of paper at the 
top of which is printed the key containing (9 abstract symbo ls and 9 corresponding numbers). The 
key remains visible to the subject throughout the test. A sequence of 120 symbo ls (the first 10 
symbo ls are practice items ) is presented in 8 rows below the key . In each row, em pty boxes are 
located immediately  below the boxes containing the symbols. The examiner, on a copy  of the test 
sheet, records in the empt y squares the numbers that the subject associates, orally , with the 
symbo ls. In the first test phase, the subject has to make 10 trial symbo l-number associations 
without a time limit. The examiner will correct any errors made during this phase. After this 
learning phase, the test proper begins. The subject has to make a s many associ ations as possible 
within the 90 -second t ime limit. If the subject is able to complete all 110 associat ions before the 
time runs out, the test is stopped. The test score is the number of correct associations made by the 
subject in the time all owed.
9.1.8.2.7 SAT
The SAT is a measure of sustained attention that uses a signal detection paradigm. The subject 
indicates whether a small gray square has been presented on screen. The subject responds by 
pressing the Yes key  when the gray  square has been presente d and No when it is not presented. A 
distractor condit ion is present in so me trials, where the screen background flashes at a rapid rate 
and thereby  makes i t more difficul t to determine whether the gray  square has been presented. 
Perform ance is measured by calculat ing the total correct responses. It takes approximately 
11 minutes to complete the test.
9.1.8.3 Other Pharmacodynamic Measures
This section applies only to the main study (subjects with PD).
9.1.8.3.1 Global Impression Scales
The CGI [17]consist of 2 subscales: CGI -S and the CGI- I. The CGI -S assesses the clinician’s 
impression of the subject’s clinical condit ion. Both the CGI -I and CGI -S will be ra ted with respect 
to stabilit y (gait, balance, falls) and cognit ion in separate assessments. The clinician should use

subject’s illness on a 7 -point scale ra nging from 1) Normal, not at all ill to 7) Among the most 
extrem ely ill patients. This rating is based on observed and reported symptoms, behavior, and 
funct ion in the past 7 day s and shoul d reflect the average severit y level across the 7 day s.
The CGI -I assesses the subject’s improvement (or worsening) on a 7 -point scale ranging from 
1)Very  much improved since the init iation o f treatment to 7) Very much worse since the init iation 
of treatment. Each time the subject is seen after treatment has been init iated, the clinician co mpares 
the subject’s overall clinical condit ion to the 1 -week period just before the init iation of medicat ion 
use (baseline). The CGI -S score obtained at the baseline visit serves as a basis for making this 
assessment . In all cases, the assessment should be made independent of whether the clinician 
believes the improvement is drug -related or not.
Patient-reported global impression o f severit y and improvement (PGI -S and PGI -I, respectively) 
will be assessed [18]. PGI -I will be rated on a 7 -point scale and PGI -S will be rated on a 6 -point 
scale. Both the PGI -I and PGI -S will be rated with respect to stabilit y (gait, balance, falls) and 
cogni tion in separate assessments.

9.1.13 Contraception and Pregnancy Avoidance Procedure
9.1.13.1 Male Subjects and Their Female Partners
From  signing of informed consent, throughout the duration of the study, and for 102 days after last 
dose of study drug, nonsterilized** male subjects who are sexually act ive with a female partner of 
childbearing potential* must use barrier contraceptio n (eg, condom wit h or without spermicidal 
cream  or jelly). In addition, they must not donate sperm during this period. Women of childbearing 
potenti al who are partners of male subjects are also advised to use addit ional contraception as 
shown in the list conta ining highly effect ive contraception below.
*Wo men NOT of childbearing potential are defined as those who have been surgically sterilized 
(hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, or tubal ligation) or who are postmenopausal (eg, defined 
as continuous amenorr hea of at least 12 months and a fo llicle -stimulating hormone (FSH)>40 
IU/L, confirmed before any study  drug i s implemented.
**Sterilized males should be at least 1 y ear postvasectomy  and have confirmed that they  have 
obtained documentation of the absence o f sperm  in the ej aculate.
Subjects will be provided with information on acceptable methods of contraception as part of the 
subject informed consent process and will be asked to sign the consent form stating that they 
understand the requirements for avoida nce of pregnancy during the course of the study and for 102 
days after the last dose of study  drug.
9.1.13.2 Female Subjects and Their Male Partners
From  signing of informed consent, throughout the duration of the study , and for 42 days after last 
dose of study  drug, female subjects of childbearing potential* who are sexually active wit h a 
nonsterilized male partner** must use a highly effective method of contraception (fro m the list in 
Secti on 9.1.13.3 ).
In addit ion they  must be advised not to donate ova during this period.
9.1.13.3 Definitions and Procedures for Contraception and Pregnancy Avoidance
The follow ing definitions apply for contraception and pregnancy avoidance procedures.

True sexual abstinence, only if this is in line wit h the preferred and usual lifest yle of the 
subject. True abst inence is defined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the 
entire peri od of  the study , from 1 month pri or to the first dose un til 42 days after last dose.
2.Unacceptable methods of contraception are:
Horm onal methods. Horm onal contraceptives are not considered to be highly effective 
contraceptives in the context of this study  becaus e the impact of TAK -071 on the 
metabo lism of these drugs has not yet been studied. However, subjects taking these 
medicat ions m ay cont inue to take them during the study as lo ng as they  are using a highly  
effect ive method of contraception listed above.
Periodic abst inence (eg, calendar, ovulat ion, symptothermal, postovulat ion methods).
Spermicides only .
Withdrawal.
No m ethod at all.
Use of female and male condoms together.
Cap/di aphragm/sponge, even if used wit h spermicidal jellies or creams and even with 
condom.

tests will be performed only for women of childbearing potential and all subjects (male and 
fema le) will receive continued guidance with respect to the avo idance of pregnancy and sperm 
donati on as part of the study  procedures. Such guidance should include a reminder of the 
following:
a)Contraceptive requirements of the study .
b)Reasons for use of barrier methods (ie, condom) in males with pregnant partners.
c)Assessment of subject compliance through questions such as:
i.Have you used the contraception consistent ly and correctly since the last visit ?
ii.Have y ou forgotten to use contraception since the last visit ?
iii.Are your menses late (even in women wit h irregular or infrequent menstrual cycles a 
pregnancy test must be performed if the answer is “yes”).
iv.Is there a chance you could be pregnant ?
5.In addit ion to a negative serum hCG pregnancy test at screening, female subjects of 
childbearing potential must also have a negat ive ur ine dipst ick hCG pregnancy test 1 day o r the

9.1.14 Pregnancy
If any subject is found to be pregnant during administration of act ive study drug , for example, after 
baseline/Day 1 or within 42 days of the last dose of active study drug, she should be withdrawn and 
any sponsor -supplied drug should be immediately discontinued. The pregnancy should be reported 
immediately , using a pregnancy  notificat ion form, to the contact listed in Sect ion 1.2.
Shoul d the pregnancy  occur during or after administration of blinded drug, the invest igator must 
inform  the subject of her right to receive treatment informat ion. If the subject chooses to receive 
unblinded treatment informat ion, the individual blind should be broken by the invest igator. 
Subjects rando mized to placebo need not be fo llowed.
If the fema le subject or female partner of a male subject agrees to the primary care physician being 
inform ed, the invest igator should notify the primary care physician that the subject was 
participat ing in a clinical study at the time female subject/female partner o f the subject became 
pregnant and provide details o f the study  drug the subject received (blinded or unblinded, as 
applicable).
All reported pregnancies, including female partners of male subjects, in subjects on active study  
drug will be fo llowed up to fi nal outcom e, using the pregnancy  form. Pregnancies will remain 
blinded to the study team. The outcome, including any premature terminat ion, must be reported to 
the sponsor. An evaluat ion after the birth of the child will also be conducted.

The invest igator will review all 12- lead ECG data, including est imates of ECG intervals, for 
real-time safet y monitoring purposes, and an assessment of normalit y/abnorm ality will be 
recorded in the eCRF.
For both screening and safet y ECGs, a standard 12 -leadECG will be recorded. The invest igator (or 
a qualified observer at the study  site) will  interpret the ECG using 1 of the following categories: 
within normal limit s, abnormal but not clinically significant, or abnormal and clinically significant. 
The time that the ECG was performed will be recorded. The fo llowing parameters will be recorded 
on the eCRF from the subject’s ECG trace: heart rate, RR interval, PR interval, QT interval, QRS 
interval , QT interval wit h Fridericia correction, and QT interval wit h Bazett correction.
All stationary  12-lead ECG machines will be supplied by the site. Subjects should be in a supine 
position after an approximate 10 -minute rest period for ECG recordings. Should technical 
difficult ies occur during recording of the ECG, a re asonable attempt should be made to repeat the 
ECG shortly after the failed attempt.
One copy o f the 12 -lead ECG wit h the invest igator’s signature and date of assessment will be filed 
with the source documents and captured in the appropriate eCRF. If the or iginal ECG is printed on 
thermal paper, the ECG report must be photocopied and certified. The photocopy will be filed wit h 
the original ECG in the source.
If an ECG is scheduled at the same time as blood draws or vital signs, the ECG will be obtained 
within 0.5 hours before the scheduled blood draw/vital sign assessment. If an ECG co incides wit h 
a meal, the ECG will  take precedence followed by the meal.
9.1.16 Assessment of Suicidal Ideation and Behavior
The C -SSRS was developed by  researchers at Col umbia Universi ty as a tool  to sy stematically 
assess suicidal ideat ion and behavior in subjects during participat ion in a clinical trial o f 
centrally -acting drugs. The C -SSRS i s composed of 3 quest ions addressing suicidal behavior and 
5questions addressing suicidal idea tion, wi th subquesti ons assessing the severit y. The tool  is 
administered via interview with the subject.

In unavo idable circumstances (eg, a widespread disease outbreak or natural disaster) that impact 
the abilit y to conduct study  procedures according to the Schedule of Procedures ( Appendix A), 
contingency measures may be implemented. In acknowledgement of FDA guidance 
(fda.gov/regulatory -informat ion/search -fda-guidance -docum ents/fda -guidance -conduct -clinical -

well as study  site, hospi tal, local, state, and nat ional restrict ions established during these kinds of 
circumstances, the fo llowing measures are being taken for the current study :
Other than the final visit, alternat ive methods for conduct ing subject visit s (eg, telephone visits, 
video conferencing, or in -home study visits conducted by site personnel cont ingent upon loca l 
regul ations) may be used per approval by the sponsor or designee.
–Approval may be granted to omit collection of certain study  assessments and visit windows 
may be extended.
–When approval is given for a subject to miss an in -person study visit, a study site physician 
will speak directly wit h the subject by telephone or other medium (eg, a computer- based 
video communicat ion) during each visit window to assess subject safet y and overall 
clinical status.
–At minimum, the study  site physician or other qualified site personnel should conduct the 
following assessments within specified -visit window timeframes: AE assessments, 
docum entation of  concomi tant m edicati on, administrati on of  C-SSRS, and an assessment

considered missing data and such departures will be recorded in the study  records.
–The m aximum  interval between successive study  visit s may be no l onger than 8 weeks.
The final visit should be perfo rmed in person. When it is not possible for the subject to come to 
the study site, the preferred alternat ive for the final visit is for qualified study site personnel to 
go to the subject’s residence and conduct the protocol -specified procedures in that lo cation. 
Assessments collected at a subject’s residence should comply wit h applicable local 
regul ations.
All subject discont inuat ions and alternat ive approaches to study  procedures (i e, procedures not 
conducted per the Schedule of Procedures) due to the COV ID-19 pandemic must be documented 
in the study  records as rel ated to COVID -19. Data collected using alternat ive methods m ay be

Please refer to the sample management plan.
The sample will be labeled with a unique sample ident ifier similar to labeling in the main study but 
using a code that is different from the code attached to the health information and other clinical test 
resul ts collected in the study . The sample and data are linked to personal health informat ion with 
code numbers. This link means that the subject may be ident ified but only indirect ly. The code 
numbers will be kept secure by  or on behalf of the sponsor.
Subjects who consented and provided a sample for DNA analysis can wit hdraw their consent and 
request di sposal  of a stored sam ple at any  time. The sponsor will be notified of consent 
withdrawal .
When a subject requests disposal o f a stored sample during the retention period, the site will ask 
the vendor to destroy  the sample via the sponsor according to the procedure. the vendor will 
destroy  the sample in accordance wit h the procedure, a nd notify the site and sponsor. However, a

donor has been destroy ed and i t is impossible to link the sample to any  given subject.
Even if the sample can be linked t o the subject, when DNA analysis has been conducted, the 
remaining samples will be destroy ed and the resul ts of DNA analysis of anonymized subject will 
be retained by the sponsor.

10.0 PRETREATMENT EVENTS AND ADVERSE EVENTS
This sect ion applies to all subjects.
10.1 Definitions
10.1.1 PTEs
A PTE i s defined as any untoward m edical  occurrence in a clinical invest igation subject who has 
signed inform ed consent to participate in a study  but before administration of any study  drug; i t 
does not necessarily  have to have a causal relat ionship wit h study  parti cipat ion.
10.1.2 AEs
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical invest igation subject 
administered a drug; it does not necessarily have to have a causal relat ionship with this treatment.
An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (eg , a clinically significant abnormal 
laboratory  value), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use o f a drug whether or not 
it is considered related to the drug.
10.1.3 Additional Points to Consider for PTEs and AEs
An untoward finding generally may:
Indicate a new diagnosis or unexpected worsening of a pre -exist ing condit ion. (Intermittent 
events for pre -exist ing condit ions or underlying disease should not be considered PTEs or 
AEs.)
Necessitate therapeutic intervent ion.
Requi re an invasive diagnostic procedure.
Requi re discont inuat ion or a change in dose of study  drug or a concomitant medicat ion.
Be considered unfavorable by the invest igator for any reason.
PTEs/AEs caused by a study  procedure (eg, a bruise after blood draw) should be recorded as a 
PTE/AE.
Diagnoses versus signs and symptoms:
Each event should be recorded to represent a single  diagnosis. Acco mpanying signs (including 
abnorm al laboratory  values or ECG findings) or symptoms should NOT be recorded as 
additional AEs. If  a diagnosis is unkno wn, sign(s) or symptom(s) should be recorded 
appropriately  as a PTE(s) or as an AE(s).
TAK -071
Study No. TAK -071-2002 Page 69of 125
Protocol Incorporating Amendment No. 4 07September 2021
CONFIDENTIALLaboratory  values and ECG findings:
Changes in laboratory  values or ECG findings are only  considered to be PTEs or AEs if they 
are judged to be clinically significant (i e, if so me action or intervent ion is required or if the 
investigator judges the change to be bey ond the range of normal physio logic fluctuati on). A 
laboratory  or ECG re -test and/or continued monitoring of an abnormal value or finding are not 
considered an interventi on. In addi tion, repeated or addi tional noninvasive testing for 
verification, evaluat ion or monitoring o f an abnormalit y is not consi dered an intervent ion.
If abnormal laboratory values or ECG findings are the result of pathology for which there is an 
overall diagnosis (eg, increased creat inine in renal failure), the diagnosis only should be 
reported appropriately  as a PTE or as an AE.
Pre-exist ing condit ions:
Pre-exist ing condit ions (present at the time o f signing of informed consent) are conside red 
concurrent medical condit ions and should NOT be recorded as PTEs or AEs. Baseline 
evaluat ions (eg, laboratory tests, ECG, x -rays) should NOT be recorded as PTEs unless related 
to study procedures. However, if the subject experiences a worsening or comp lication of such a 
concurrent medical condit ion, the worsening or complicat ion should be recorded appropriately 
as a PTE (worsening or complication occurs before start of study drug) or an AE (worsening or 
complicat ion occurs after start of study  drug). In vestigators shoul d ensure that the event term 
recorded captures the change in the condit ion (eg, “worsening o f…”).
If a subject has a pre -exist ing episodic concurrent medical condit ion (eg, asthma, epilepsy) any 
occurrence of an episode should only be capt ured as a PTE/AE if the condit ion beco mes more 
frequent, serious or severe in nature. I Investigators should ensure that the AE term recorded 
captures the change in the condit ion from Baseline (eg, “worsening of…”).
If a subject has a degenerat ive concurre nt medical condit ion (eg, cataracts, rheumatoid 
arthri tis), worsening of the condition should only  be recorded as a PTE/AE if occurring to a 
greater extent to that which would be expected. Investigators should ensure that the AE term 
recorded captures the change in the condit ion (eg, “worsening o f…”).
Worsening of PTEs or AEs:
If the subject experiences a worsening or complication of a PTE after the start of study  drug, 
the worsening or complication should be recorded as an AE. Invest igators should ensure t hat 
the AE term recorded captures the change in the PTE (eg, “worsening of…”).
If the subject experiences a worsening or complicatio n of an AE after any change in study drug, 
the worsening or complication should be recorded as a new AE. Investigators should ensure 
that the AE term recorded captures the change in the condit ion (eg, “w orsening of…”).
Changes in intensit y of AEs/serious PTEs:
If the subject experiences changes in intensit y of an AE/seri ous PTE, the event should be 
captured once with the maximum intensit y recorded.

CONFIDENTIALPrepl anned procedures (surgeries or intervent ions):
Prepl anned procedures (surgeries or therapies) that were scheduled before signing of informed 
consent are not considered PTEs or AEs. However, if a preplanned procedure is performed 
early (eg, as an emergency) due to a worsening of the pre -exist ing condit ion, the worsening o f 
the condit ion should be recorded as a PTE or an AE . Complicat ions result ing from any planned 
surgery  shoul d be reported as AEs.
Elect ive surgeries or procedures:
Elect ive procedures performed where there is no change in the subject’s medica l condit ion 
shoul d not be recorded as PTEs or AEs, but should be documented in the subject’s source 
docum ents. Com plicat ions result ing from an elect ive surgery should be reported as AEs.
Overdose:
Cases of overdose with any medicat ion wit hout manifested si de effects are NOT considered PTEs 
or AEs, but instead will be documented on the eCRF. Any manifested side effects will be 
considered PTEs or AEs and will be recorded on the AE page of the eCRF.
10.1.4 SAEs
An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence tha t at any  dose:
1.Results in DEATH.
2.Is LIFE THREATENING.
The term “life threatening” refers to an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the 
time of the event; it does not refer to an event that hypothetically might have caused death 
if it were m ore severe.
3.Requi res inpat ient HOSPITALIZATION or prolongation of exist ing hospitalizat ion.
4. Results in persistent or significant DISABILITY/INCAPACITY.
5.Leads to a CONGENITAL ANOMALY/BIRTH DEFECT.
6.Is an IMPORTANT MEDICAL EVENT that satisfies any of the fo llowing:
May require intervent ion to prevent items 1 through 5 above.
May expose the subject to danger, even though the event is not immediately life 
threatening or fatal or does not result in hospitalization.
Includes any event or synonym described in the Ta keda Medically  Significant AE List 
(Table 10.a).

CONFIDENTIAL10.1.6 Causality of AEs
The rel ationship of each AE to study  drug(s) will be assessed using the fo llowing categori es:
Related: An AE that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of a drug (including the 
course after withdrawal of the drug), or for which possible involvement of the drug cannot be 
ruled out , although factors other than the drug, such as underlying diseases, complic ations, 
concomitant medications and concurrent treatments, may also be responsible.
Not Related: An AE that does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of a drug and/o r 
that can reasonably be explained by other factors, such as unde rlying diseases, complications, 
concomitant medications and concurrent treatments.
10.1.7 Relationship to Study Procedures
Relationship (causalit y) to study  procedures should be determined for all PTEs and AEs.
The relationship should be assessed as Related if the investigator considers that there is reasonable 
possibilit y that an event is due to a study procedure. Otherwise, the relationship should be assessed 
as Not Related.
10.1.8 Start Date
The start date of the AE/PTE is the date that the first signs/symptoms were noted by  the subject 
and/or invest igator.
10.1.9 Stop Date
The stop date of the AE/PTE is the date at which the subject recovered, the event resolved but with 
sequelae or the subject died.
10.1.10 Frequency
Episodi c AEs/PTE (eg, vomit ing) or those which occur repeatedly over a peri od of  consecutive 
days are intermittent. All other events are continuous.
10.1.11 Action Concerning Study Drug
Drug withdrawn: a study  drug i s stopped due to the particular AE.
Dose not changed: the particular AE did not require stopping a study drug.
Unknown: only to be used if it has not been possible to determine what action has been taken.
Not applicable: a study drug was stopped for a reason other than the particular AE eg, the study 
has been terminated, the subject died, dosing with study  drug was already stopped before the 
onset of the AE.
Drug interrupted: the drug was interrupted due to the particular AE.
10.1.12 Outcome
Recovered/reso lved: subject returned to first assessment status with respect to the AE/PTE.
TAK -071

Protocol Incorporating Amendment No. 4 07September 2021
CONFIDENTIALRecovering/resolving: the intensit y is lowered by 1 or m ore stages: the diagnosis or 
signs/symptom s has almost di sappeared; the abnormal laboratory  value improved, but has not 
returned to the normal range or to baseline; the subject died from a cause other than the 
particular AE/PTE with the condi tion rem aining “recovering/reso lving”.
Not recovered/not resolved: there is no change in the diagnosis, signs or symptoms; the 
intensity of the di agnosis, si gns/ symptom s or laboratory  value on the last day  of the observed 
study  period has got worse than w hen it started; is an irreversible congenital ano maly; the 
subject died fro m another cause with the particular AE/PTE state remaining “Not 
recovered/not resolved”.
Reso lved with sequelae: the subject recovered from an acute AE/PTE but was left with 
perm anent/si gnificant impairment (eg, recovered from a cardiovascular accident but with 
some persisting paresis).
Fatal : the AEs/PTEs which are considered as the cause of death.
Unknown: the course of the AE/PTE cannot be fo llowed up due to hospital change or residence 
change at the end of the subject’s participation in the study .
10.2 Procedures
10.2.1 Collection and Reporting of AEs
Collect ion of PTEs will co mmence from the time the subject signs the informed consent to 
participate in the study and continue until the subje ct is first administered study drug baseline/Day 
1) or until screen failure. For subjects who discont inue before study drug administration, PTEs are 
collected unt il the subject discont inues study  parti cipat ion.
Collect ion of AEs will co mmence fro m the time that the subject is first administered study  drug 
baseline/Day 1). Routine collection of AEs will continue unt il the fo llow-up safet y phone call ( ≥14 
days after the last dose).
10.2.1.1 PTE and AE Reporting
At each study  visit, the investi gator will assess whether any  subjective AEs have occurred. A 
neutral  quest ion, such as “How have you been feeling since your last visit ?” may be asked. 
Subjects m ay report AEs occurri ng at any  other time during the study . Subjects experi encing a 
serious PTE m ust be monitore d until the symptoms subside and any clinically relevant changes in 
laboratory  values have returned to baseline or there is a sat isfactory  explanati on for the change. 
Nonserious PTEs, related or unrelated to the study  procedure, need not to be fo llowed-up for the 
purposes of the protocol.
All subjects experiencing AEs, whether considered associated with the use of the study drug or not, 
must be monitored until the symptoms subside and any  clinically relevant changes in laboratory  
values have returned to bas eline or until there is a satisfactory  explanat ion for the changes 
observed. All PTEs and AEs will be documented in the PTE/AE page of the eCRF, whether or not

10.2.2 Collection, Reporting, and Acknowledgment of SAEs
When an SAE occurs through the AE collection period it should be reported according to the 
following procedure:
The preferred method of reporting SAEs is via the SAE eCRF page in the electronic data capture 
(EDC) system. If access to EDC is not fea sible within 24 hours of receiving the event, a paper SAE 
form shoul d be submitted via fax (see Sect ion 1.2for fax number).
If fax is used, si te personnel need to confirm successful transmissio n of all pages and include an 
email address on the fax cover sheet so that an acknowledgment of receipt can be returned via 
email wi thin 1 business day .
Email submissio n of SAE forms with a PDF attachment should only be used in the case where fax 
is not possible and EDC is not feasible wit hin 24 hours of receiving the event,
In case of email, site personnel need to confirm successful transmissio n by await ing an 
acknowledgment of the receipt via email within 1 business day,
If SAEs are reported via fax or by  email, the EDC must be updated as soon as possible wit h the 
appropriate informat ion,
The SAE informat ion shoul d be com pleted as fully as possible but con tain, at a minimum:
A short descript ion of the event and the reason why the event i s categori zed as serious.
Subject ID number.
Invest igator’s name.
Nam e of the study  drug.

Any SAE spontaneously reported to the invest igator fo llowing the AE collect ion period should be 
reported to the sponsor if considere d related to study  parti cipat ion.
Reporting of serious PTEs will fo llow the procedure described for SAEs.
10.2.3 Reporting of Abnormal LFTs
If a subject is noted to have ALT or AST elevated >3 ×ULN on 2 consecutive occasions, the 
abnorm ality should be recorded a s an AE. In addition, addit ional information on relevant recent 
history , risk factors, clinical signs and symptoms and results of any  addi tional diagnosti c tests 
perform ed will be recorded.
If a subject is noted to have ALT or AST >3 ×ULN and total biliru bin >2×ULN for which an 
alternat ive etio logy has not been i dentified, the event should be recorded as an SAE and reported 
per Section 10.2.2 . The investigator must contact the medical mo nitor for discussio n of the 
relevant subject details and possible alternative etiologies, such as acute viral hepat itis A or B or 
other acute liver disease or medical history /concurrent m edical  condi tions. Fo llow-up laboratory  
tests as described in Sect ion 9.1.11 must also be performed. In addit ion, an LFT Increases eCRF 
must be completed and transmitted with the Takeda SAE form (per Section 10.2.2 )
.
10.3 Follow -up of SAEs
If informat ion not available at the time of the first report becomes available at a later date, the 
investigator should update the SAE form in the eCRF and provide other written documentation 
within 24 hours of receipt. However, as a back -up, if requi red, the SAE paper form should be 
completed, si gned by the invest igator, and transmit ted wi thin 24 hours to the attention of the 
contact listed in Section 1.2.Copies of any relevant data from the hospital notes (eg, ECGs, 
laboratory  tests, di scharge summary , postm ortem  resul ts) shoul d be sent to the attenti on of  the 
contact listed in Section 1.2, if requested.
All SAEs should be fo llowed up unt il reso lution or perm anent outcome of the event. The timelines 
and procedure for follow -up reports are the same as those for the init ial report.
10.3.1 Safety Reporting to Investigators, IRB s, and Regulatory Authorities
The sponsor will be responsible for reporting all suspected unexpected serious adverse react ions 
(SUSARs) and any other applicable SAEs to regulatory  authori ties, invest igators, and IRBs.
Relative to the first awareness o f theevent by /or further provisio n to the sponsor or sponsor’s 
designee, SUSARs will be submitted to the regulatory authorit ies as expedited report within 7 days 
for fatal  and life -threatening events and 15 day s for other seri ous events. The sponsor will also 
prepare an expedited report for other safet y issues where these might materially  alter the current 
benefit -risk assessment of a study  drug/sponsor supplied drug or that would be sufficient to 
consider changes in the study  drug/sponsor supplied drug adminis tration or in the overall conduct 
of the study . The study  site also will  forward a copy  of all expedi ted reports to hi s or her IRB .

The pharmacodynamic analysis set will consist of subjects who receive at least 1 dose of study  
drug and who have at least 1 evaluable postdose pharmacodynamic measure. All TAK -071 dose 
groups will be co mbined.
13.1.2 Analysis of Demographics and Other Baseline Characteristics
Dem ographics and baseline characterist ics will be listed and summar ized by each sequence group 
and overall using the safet y analysis set.
13.1.3 Pharmacodynamic Analysis (Subjects With PD)
Summary  statistics will be provided for the observed values of the efficacy  measures at baseline 
and each of the postdose visit s by t reatm entgroups. Change from baseline will also be summarized 
with descript ive statist ics by treatment groups.
The primary outcome, the change from baseline in gait variabilit y dur ing a 2 -minute walk test, will 
be analyzed using a linear mixed effect model wit h a random factor for subject and fixed factors 
for treatm ent, peri od, and sequence. Baseline covariates will be included in the model as 
appropriate.
The effect of treatment on the overall cognit ive battery  will be analyzed using a linear mixed 
effects m odel with rando m effects for subjects for each cognit ive test, fixed factors for treatment, 
test, period, and sequence. The comparison of the number of falls for placebo versus TAK -071 will 
be analyzed using a generalized linear mixed effects model with a rando m factor f or subjects and 
fixed factors for treatment, period, and sequence.
To address the exploratory  outcom es, the continuous endpo ints will be analyzed using linear 
mixed effects models with a rando m factor for subject and fixed factors for treatment, period, and 
sequence.
Drug effects on change fro m baseline for all endpoints will be assessed using 1 -sided tests. In all 
analyses the interaction terms and covariates will be added as appropriate. If the outcomes are 
positively skewed, a logarithmic trans formation may be applied. All other statist ical analyses of 
pharmacodynamic endpo ints will be described in the SAP .

No formal interim analysis is planned. The safety  and PK review of the sent inel cohort will be 
described in detail in the Internal Review Charter. Stopping rules are described in Sect ion 6.4.
13.3 Determination of Sample Size (Subjects With PD)
A sample size o f 42 com pleters wi th PD will  be sufficient to detect a statistically significant (α = 
0.05, 1 -sided) decrease in gait variabilit y during walking for TAK -071 versus placebo. We expect 
to de tect a minimum effects size of 0.32 (Cohen d) in the reduction of gait variabilit y, similar to 
that observed in [2]. For the sample size calculat ion, the study  power was assumed to be 80%.
Given the proposed study  sample size and 80% power, a minimum detectable operational effect 
size [
20]for the cognit ive battery  (α = 0.1, 1 -sided) will be 0.49. The correlations between 
TAK -071

CONFIDENTIALcogni tive tests are assumed to be 0.5. The minimum detectable (α = 0.1, 1 -sided) effect size in the 
number of falls will be approximately 0.3, similar to the effect size for the number of falls 
observed in the literature [2,3] . For all  calculat ions, the wi thin-person c orrelati on for the primary  
and secondary  outcom es was assumed to be 0.65 [
3].
It is expected that approximately 64 subjects will be randomized to ensure at least 42 completers. 
During the study, blinded monitoring of the data will take place to evaluate assumpt ions regarding 
the dist ribut ion of key  study  variables. If necessary up to 70 subjects may be randomized. Details 
will be provided in the SAP.

This sect ion applies to all subjects.
14.1 Study -Site Monitoring Visits
Moni toring visit s to the study  site (on -site and/or remote) will be made periodically  during the 
study  to ensure that all aspects of the protocol are followed. Source documents will be reviewed 
for verificat ion of data recorded on the eCRFs. Source documen ts are defined as original 
docum ents, data, and records. The invest igator guarantees access to source documents by the 
sponsor or its designee (contract research organization) and by  the IRB.
All aspects of the study and its documentation will be subject to review by the sponsor or sponsor’s 
designee (as long as blinding is not jeopardized), including but not limited to the Investigator’s 
Binder, study  drug, subject m edical records, informed consent documentation, documentation of 
subject authorizat ion to u se personal healt h information (if separate fro m the inform ed consent 
forms and review of eCRFs and associated source documents. It is important that the invest igator 
and other study  personnel are available during the mo nitoring visits and that sufficient time is 
devoted to the process.
14.2 Protocol Deviations
The invest igator should not deviate fro m the protocol , except where necessary  to eliminate an 
immediate hazard to study subjects. Should other unexpected circumstances arise that will require 
deviat ion from protocol -specified procedures, such as the COVID -19 pandemic , 
the invest igator 
shoul d consul t with the sponsor or designee (and IRB, as required) to determine the appropriate 
course of action. There will be no exempt ions (a prospectively  approved deviat ion) from the 
inclusio n or excl usion criteria.
The site should document all protocol deviat ions in the subject’s source documents. In the event of 
a significant devi ation, the si te shoul d notify  the sponsor or i ts desi gnee (and IRB, as required). 
Significa nt deviat ions include, but are not limited to, those that invo lve fraud or misconduct, 
increase the healt h risk to the subject, or confound interpretation of primary study  assessment. A 
Protocol  Deviat ion Form should be completed by the site and signed by the sponsor or designee for 
any significant deviat ion from the protocol .
The invest igator should document all protocol deviations.

those of foreign governments (eg, the FDA, the United Kingdo m Medicines and Healthcare 
products Regulatory Agency, the Pharmaceut icals and Medical Devices Agency o f Japan). If the 
study  site is contacted for an inspect ion by a regulatory  body , the sponsor should be notified 
immediately . The investi gator guarantees access for qualit y assurance a uditors to all study  
docum ents as described in Sect ion 14.1.
15.0 ETHICAL ASPECTS OF T HE STUDY
This sect ion applies to all subjects.
This study  will be conducted wi th the highest respect for the individual participants (ie, subjects) 
according to the protocol, the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declarat ion of Helsinki, 
and the ICH Harmonised Tripartite Guideline for GC P. Each invest igator will conduct the study 
according to applicable local or regional regulatory requirements and align his or her conduct in 
accordance with the “Responsibilit ies of the Investigator” that are listed in Appendix D. The 
principles of Helsinki are addressed through the protocol and through appendices containing 
requi rements for informed consent and invest igator responsibilit
ies.
15.1 IRB
IRBs m ust be consti tuted according to the applicable state, federal and local requirements. The 
sponsor or designee will require documentation noting all names and t itles of members who make 
up the respect ive IRB. If any member of the IRB has direct participat ion in this study , written 
notification regarding his or her abst inence fro m voting must also be obtained. Those Americas 
sites unwilling to provide names and tit les of all members due to privacy and conflict of interest 
concerns should instead provide a Federal Wide Assuranc e Number or com parable number 
assigned by  the Depart ment of Healt h and Human Services.
The sponsor or designee will supply relevant documents for submissio n to the respective IRB for 
the protocol’s review and approval. This protocol, the Invest igator’s Bro chure, a copy  of the 
inform ed consent form, and, if applicable, subject recruit ment materials and/or advertisements and 
other documents required by all applicable laws and regulat ions, must be submitted to a central or 
local IRB for approval. The IRB’s wri tten approval o f the protocol  and subject informed consent 
must be obtained and submitted to the sponsor or designee before commencement of the study (ie, 
before shipment of the sponsor -supplied drug and study -specific screening act ivity). The IRB 
approval must refer to the study by exact protocol title, number, and versio n date; ident ify versio ns 
of other documents (eg, informed consent form) reviewed; and state the approval date. Until the 
site receives notificat ion no protocol act ivities, including scree ning, m ay occur.

Protocol Incorporating Amendment No. 4 07September 2021
CONFIDENTIALStudy  sites m ust adhere to all requirements st ipulated by their respect ive IRB. This may include 
notification to the IRB regarding protocol amendments, updates to the informed consent form, 
recrui tment m aterials intended for viewing by  subjects, local safet y reporti ng requirements, 
reports and updates regarding the ongoing review of the study  at intervals specified by  the 
respective IRB, and submissio n of the investigator’s final status report to IRB. All IRB approvals 
and relevant document ation for these i tems m ust be provi ded to the sponsor or its designee.
Subject incentives should not exert undue influence for participat ion. Payments to subjects must 
be approved by the IRB and sponsor.
15.2 Subject Information, Informed Consent, and Subject A uthorization
Written consent documents will embody  the elements of informed consent as described in the 
Declaration of Helsinki and the ICH Guidelines for GCP and will be in accordance with all 
applicable laws and regulations. The informed consent form, su bject authorizat ion form (if 
applicable), and subject informat ion sheet (if applicable) describe the planned and permitted uses, 
transfers, and disclo sures of the subject’s personal and personal healt h informat ion for purposes of 
conducting the study. The informed consent form and the subject informat ion sheet (if applicable) 
further explain the nature of the study, its object ives, and potential risks and benefit s, as well as the 
date informed consent is given. The informed consent form will detail the requ irements of the 
participant and the fact that he or she is free to withdraw at any  time wi thout giving a reason and 
without prej udice to hi s or her further m edical care.
The invest igator is responsible for the preparation, content, and IRB approval o f the informed 
consent form and if applicable, the subject authorization form. The informed consent form, subject  
authori zation form (if applicable), and subject info rmation sheet (if applicable) must be approved 
by both the IRB and the sponsor before use.
The i nform ed consent form , subject authori zation form  (if applicable), and subject informat ion 
sheet (if applicable) must be written in a language fully co mprehensible to the prospective subject. 
It is the responsibilit y of the invest igator to explain the detailed elements of the informed consent 
form, subject authorizat ion form (if applicable), and subject informat ion sheet (if applicable) to the 
subject. Information should be given in both oral and written form whenever possible and in the 
manner deemed approp riate by  the IRB. In the event the subject is not capable of rendering 
adequate written informed consent, then the subject’s legally  acceptable representative may 
provi de such consent for the subject in accordance with applicable laws and regulat ions.
The subject, or the subject’s legally acceptable representative, must be given ample opportunit y to: 
(1) inquire about details of the study and (2) decide whether or not to participate in the study. If the 
subject, or the subject’s legally  acceptable represent ative, determines he or she will part icipate in 
the study , then the informed consent form and subject authorizat ion form (if applicable) m ust be 
signed and dated by  the subject, or the subject’s legally  acceptable representative, at the time of 
consent and before the subject entering into the study . The subject or the subject’s legally 
acceptable representative should be instructed to sign using their legal names, not nicknames, 
using blue or black ballpo int ink. The invest igator must also sign and date the informed consent 
form and subject authorizat ion (if applicable) at th e time of consent and before subject entering

CONFIDENTIALinto the study; however, the sponsor may  allow a designee of the invest igator to sign to the extent 
permitted by  applicable law.
Once signed, the ori ginal  informed consent form , subject authori zation form (if applicable), and 
subject informat ion sheet (if applicable) will be stored in the invest igator’s site file. The 
investigator must document the date the subject signs the informed consent i n the subject’s 
medical record. Copies of the signed informed consent form, the signed subject authorization for m 
(if applicable), and subject informat ion sheet (if applicable) shall be given to the subject.
All revised informed consent forms must be revie wed and signed by relevant subjects or the 
relevant subject’s legally  acceptable representative in the same manner as the original informed 
consent. The date the revised consent was ob tained shoul d be recorded in the subject’s medical 
record, and the subje ct shoul d receive a copy  of the revised informed consent form.
Subjects who consented and provided sample for DNA analysis can withdraw their consent and 
request di sposal  of a stored sam ple at any  time before analysis. Notify  sponsor of consent 
withdrawal .
15.3 Subject Confidentiality
The sponsor and designees affirm and upho ld the principle of the subject’s right to protection 
against invasio n of privacy. Throughout this study , a subject’s source data will only be linked to 
the sponsor’s clinical trial database or documentation via a subject ID number. As permitted by all 
applicable laws and regulat ions, limited subject attributes, such as sex, age, or date of birth may be 
used to verify  the subject and accuracy  of the subject’s unique ID number.
To com ply with ICH Guidelines for GCP and to verify co mpliance with this protocol, the sponsor 
requi res the invest igator to permit the monitor or the sponsor’s designee, representatives fro m any 
regul atory  authori ty (eg, FDA, Medi cines and Heal thcare products Regul atory  Agency, 
Pharmaceut icals and Medical Devices Agency), the sponsor’s designated auditors, and the 
appropriate IRBs to review the subject’s original medical records (source data or documents), 
including, but not limited to, laboratory  test resul t reports, ECG reports, admissio n and di scharge 
summaries for hospital admissions occurring during a subject’s study  parti cipat ion, and autopsy  
reports. Access to a subject’s original medical records requires the specific authorization o f the 
subject as part of the info rmed consent process (see Section 15.2).
Copi es of  any subject source documents that are provided to the sponsor must have certain 
personally ident ifiable informat ion rem oved (ie, subject name, address, and other ident ifier fields 
not collected on the subject’s eCRF).
15.4 Publication, Disclosure, and Clinical Trial Registration Policy
15.4.1 Publication and Disclosure
The investigator is obliged to provide the sponsor with complete test results and all data derived by 
the invest igator from the study . During and after the study , only  the sponsor m ay make study  
inform ation available to other study  invest igators or to regulatory  agencies, except as required by

recrui ting status will be registered and available for public viewing.
For some registries, Takeda will assist callers in lo cating study  sites cl osest to thei r homes by 
provi ding the invest igator name, address, and phone number to the callers request ing trial 
inform ation. Once subjects receive invest igator contact informat ion, they  may call  the si te 
requesting enrollment into the trial. The invest igative sites are encouraged to handle the trial 
inquiries according to their estab lished subject screening process. If the caller asks addit ional 
questions bey ond the topic of trial enro llment, they should be referred to the sponsor.
Any invest igator who objects to the sponsor providing this informat ion to callers must provide the 
spons or wi th a wri tten noti ce request ing that their informat ion not be listed on the registry  site.
15.4.3 Clinical Trial Results Disclosure
Takeda will post the results of clinical trial son ClinicalTrials.gov and/or other publicly accessible 
websites, as required by Takeda Policy/Standard, applicable laws and/or regulat ions.

Clinical research studies sponsored by the sponsor are subject to ICH GCP and all applicable loca l 
laws and regulat ions. The responsibilit ies imposed on invest igators by the FDA are summarized in 
the “Statement of Invest igator” (Form FDA 1572), which must be completed and signed before the 
investigator may participate in this study .
The invest igator agrees to assume the fo llowing responsibilit ies by signing a Form FDA 1572:
1.Conduct the study  in accordance wit h the protocol.
2.Personally conduct or supervise the staff who will assist in the protocol.
3.Ensure th at study  related procedures, including study  specific (nonrouti ne/nonstandard panel) 
screening assessments are NOT performed on potent ial subjects, before the receipt of written 
approval  from relevant governing bodies/authorit ies.
4.Ensure that all co lleague s and em ployees assist ing in the conduct of the study are informed of 
these obligat ions.
5.Secure prior approval of the study  and any  changes by  an appropri ate IRB/independent ethics

Allow init ial subjects with PD to enroll in main study in parallel to when the sentinel cohort is 
running. These subjects must be ≤65 y ears ol d. Older subjects with PD may  be enrolled 
pending the results of the sentinel cohort PK.
Remove cogni tive load from the primary  object ive and endpo int.Add an 
exploratory /additional objective and endpo int around evaluation of gait parameters, and clarify 
that exploratory endpo ints for change fro m baseline on gait parameters, gait variabilit y, double

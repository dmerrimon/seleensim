with corticosteroids versus placebo in 
combination with corticosteroids in terms of 
overall response rate (ORR) at Day 28 in 
subjects with acute graft -versus -host disease 
(aGVHD).  ORR at Day 28, defined as the proportion of subjects 
demonstrating a complete response (CR), very good partial 
response (V GPR), or partial response (PR).  
Key Secondary Objective  Key Secondary Endpoint  
Compare  the efficacy between treatment cohort s 
at a subsequent key clinical landmark . Nonrelaps e mortality  (NRM ) at Month 6, defined as the 
proportion of subjects who died due to causes other than 
malignancy relapse at Month 6.

Overall Study Design:  
This is a randomized, double- blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter Phase 3 study of itacitinib  or placebo 
in combination with corticosteroids as first -line treatment of subjects with Grade II  to IV aGVHD.  
Subjects will be randomized 1:1 to itacitinib  200 mg once daily (QD) plus corticosteroids or matching 
placebo plus corticosteroids.  Randomization will be stratified by GVHD risk status (standard risk vs  high  
risk).  Subjects will receive randomized study treatment until treatment failure (progression o f disease, no 
response, or requiring additional systemic therapy), unacceptable toxicity, completion of taper, or death.  
Transfusion support and c ontinued use of anti -infective medications, GVHD prophylaxis medications 
(including calcineurin inhibitors), and topical steroid therapy is permitted.  
GVHD staging and grading will be assessed for efficacy as per Mount Sinai Acute GVHD International 
Consortium (MAGIC) criteria ; safety  and tolerability will be assessed as per NCI CTCAE v4.03.  
An independent data monitoring committee will perform the first  interim analysis for the primary efficacy 
analysis (futility only)  once 112 subjects (56 per cohort) have completed the Day 28 visit or withdrew 
early .  If the futility boundary is crossed at interim 1  (ie, if conditional power < 20%) , the study may be 
terminated  for futility .  A second interim ana lysis for the primary efficacy analysis (both efficacy and 
futility) will be performed once 240 subjects have completed the Day  180 visit  or withdrew early from the 
study. 
The primary analysis (ie, final primary analysis) will be conducted once the last subject completes the 
Day 180 visit or withdraws from the study.  The study w ill end once 75% of subjects have achieved 
2-year transplant -related mortality , have died, or have been  lost to follow -up.

Study Population:  
Subjects who have received an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (allo-HSCT) and have 
developed Grade II to IV  aGVHD may be eligible candidates for this  study.  
Key Inclusion Criteria:  
• Male or female, 18 years  of age or older ; outside the European Union, an  older limit could apply 
depending on local regulation (eg, 20 years and older for Taiwan and Japan) .  
• Has undergone 1 allo -HSCT  from any donor (related or unrelated with any degree of HLA matching) 
and any donor source (bone marrow, peripheral blood stem cells, or cord blood) for a hematologic 
malignancy or disorder .  Recipients of myeloablative and reduced -intensity conditioning regimens are 
eligible.  
• Clinically suspected Grade II to IV aGVHD as per MAGIC cr iteria , occurring after allo -HSCT and any 
GVHD prophyla xis regimen .  Biopsies should be obtained to pathologically confirm aGVHD; in cases 
where a biopsy is negative, is  unable to be obtained, or is clinically contraindicated, clinical suspicion of 
aGVHD by the treating physician is sufficient,  provided that alternative diagnoses of drug effects or 
infection are adequately ruled out. 
• Evidence of myeloid engraftment (eg, absolute neutrophil count ≥ 0.5 × 109/L for 3  consecutive 
assessments if ablat ive therapy was previously used ).  Use of growth fac tor supplementation is allowed.  
• Be willing to avoid pregnancy or fathering children based on 1 of the following criteria: 
- Women of nonchildbearing potential (ie, surgically steril e with a hysterectomy and /or bilateral 
oophorectomy OR  ≥ 12 months of amenorrhea). 
- Woman of childbearing potential who has a negative serum pregnancy test at screening and who 
agrees to take appropriate precautions to avoid pregnancy (with at least 99% certainty) from screening 
through safety follow-up.  Perm itted methods that are at least 99% effective in preventing pregnancy 
should be communicated to the subject and their understanding confirmed. 
- Man who agrees to take appropriate precautions to avoid fathering children (with at least 99% 
certainty) from scr eening through safety follow- up.  Permitted methods that are at least 99% effective 
in preventing pregnancy should be communicated to the subject and their understanding confirmed. 
• Able to give written informed consent and comply with all study visits and procedures.  
• Able to swallow and retain oral medication. 
Key Exclusion Criteria:  
• Has received more than 1 allo-HSCT . 
• Has received more than 2 days of systemic corticosteroids for acute- GVHD.  
• Presence of GVHD overlap syndrome.  
• Presence of an active uncontrol led infection.  An active uncontrolled infection is defined as 
hemodynamic instability attributable to sepsis or new symptoms, worsening physical signs, or 
radiographic findings attributable to infection.  Persisting fever without signs or symptoms will no t be 
interpreted as an active uncontrolled infection. 
• Known human immunodeficiency virus infection. 
• Active hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) or hepatitis B virus ( HCV ) infection that requires treatment, or at risk 
for HBV reactivation (ie, positive hepatitis B surface antigen [ HbsAg ]).  Subjects with negative HbsAg 
and positive total HB core antibody may be included if HBV DNA is undetectable at the time of 
screening.  Subjects who are positive for HCV antibody are eligible only if polymerase chain reaction 
test is negative for HCV RNA.  Subjects whose immune status is unknown or uncertain must have 
results confirming immune status before enrollment.  Prior serology results are acceptable for 
determining eligibility.

Protocol INCB 39110- 301 Am 4 Version 4 13 AUG 2018  
• Subjects with evidence of relapsed primary disease , or subjects who have been treated for relapse after 
the allo -HSCT was performed.  
• Any corticosteroid therapy for indications other than GVHD at doses > 1 mg/kg per day 
methylprednisolone (or prednisone equivalent ) within 7 days of randomization. 
• Severe or gan dysfunction unrelated to underlying GVHD, including: 
- Cholestatic disorders or unresolved veno- occlusive disease of the liver (defined as persistent bilirubin 
abnormalities not attributable to GVHD and ongoing organ dysfunction). 
- Clinically significant or uncontrolled cardiac disease, including unstable angina, acute myocardial 
infarction within 6 months of enrollment , New York Heart Association Class III or IV congestive 
heart failure, circulatory collapse requiring vasopressor or inotropic support, or arrhythmia that 
requires therapy.  
- Clinically significant respiratory disease that requires mechanical ventilation support or 50% oxygen. 
• Serum creatinine > 2.0 mg/dL or creatinine clearance < 40 mL/min mea sured or calculated by 
Cockroft-Gault equation. 
• Currently breast feeding.  
• Receipt of live (including attenuated) vaccines or anticipation of need for such a vaccine during the 
study. 
• Received Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor therapy after allo -HSCT for any indication.  Treatment with a 
JAK inhibitor before all o-HSCT is permitted.  
• Treatment with any other investigational agent, device, or procedure, within 21 days (or 5 half- lives, 
whichever is greater) of enrollment.  Subjects participating in a GVHD prophylaxis study or 
conditioning regimen should be discussed with the sponsor' s medical monitor before enrollment.  
• Any medical complications or condition s that would, in the investigator's judgment, interfere with full 
participation in the study, including administration of study drug and attending required study v isits; 
pose a significant risk to the subject; or interfere with interpretation of study data.  
• Known allergies, hypersensitivity, or intolerance to any of the study medications, excipients, or similar 
compounds.  
Study Drug, Dosage, and Mode of Administrat ion: 
Subjects will begin treatment with itacitinib  or placebo at a dose level of 200 mg (2 × 100 mg tablets) 
taken by mouth (PO) QD.  Subjects may have dose reductions and interruptions during the course of 
treatment based on safety and laboratory assessments.  Tapering of itacitinib  or placebo  is permitted 
provided that the subject has reached the Day 180 visit, achieved a CR or VGPR, and discontinued 
corticosteroid therapy for at least 8 weeks.   The dose of itacitinib  or placebo may be escalated if GVHD 
flares during the course of a taper.  Subjects who experience worsening GVHD during itacitinib  or 
placebo dose escalation and require additional therapy will be considered as having progressive disease and be withdrawn from treatment. 
Reference Therapy, Do sage, and Mode of Administration:  
Corticosteroids are the current standard care for aGVHD  and will therefore be used as background 
treatment in this study.  A ll subjects will begin treatment with methylprednisolone 2 mg/kg per day (or 
prednisone  equivalent ) or at a dose that is appropriate for the severity of disease as outlined per local 
treatment guidelines .  Subjects who previously began corticosteroid therapy at a different dose may 
remain on that dose if considered clinically appropriate by the treating physician.  Corticosteroids should be tapered as tolerated according to institutional guidelines at a rate that is commensurate with resolution 
of GVHD manifestations. 
If GVHD flares during the taper ing of corticosteroids, the dose may be re- escalated at  the investigator 's 
discretion and will not be considered treatment failure, as long as the dose does not exceed the initial 
starting dose.  If the dose required exceeds this threshold, or if the flare is unresponsive to increased 
corticosteroids or multip le flares are observed, then the subject will be considered to have  experienced 
treatment failure.

Estimated Duration of Participation:   Subject participation is expected to average 12 months, which 
includes the following: 
• A screening period lasting up to 28 days. 
• A treatment period lasting as long as the subject is benefiting from treatment.  
• A safety follow-up period lasting 30 to 35 days after treatment ends. 
• A survival follow -up period lasting until death or study withdrawal. 
Estimated Number of Subjects:   Approximately 436 subjects.  
Princip al Coordinating Investigator:   TBD  
Statistical Methods:  
An absolute improvement of 16 % in the primary endpoint of ORR at Day 28 would be considered a 
clinically meaningful improvement over standard first- line systemic treatment for aGVHD ( standard care 
ORR at Day 28: P 0 = 0.56; itacitinib ORR at Day 28: P1  = 0.72).  A 40% improvement in the ke y 
secondary endpoint of NRM at M onth 6 (0.33 vs 0.1 98) would also be considered clinically meaningful.  
A sample size of 436 subjects ( 218 per treatment cohort ) provides approximately 90% power to detect the 
overall treatment difference  of 0.16 in the primary endpoint and 83% power to detect the  overall  
treatment difference of 0.132 in the key secondary endpoint.  This sample s ize also compensates for an 
assumed 5% early withdrawal rate.  
The first interim analysis ( futility  only) is for the primary efficacy analysis on ORR at Day 28, which will 
be performed once 112 subjects  (56 per cohort) have completed the Day 28 visit or wit hdrew early from 
the study .  If the (nonbinding) futility boundary is crossed (ie, conditional power < 20%), the sponsor will 
consider stopping the study. 
A second interim analysis (for both efficacy and futility) will be performed once 240 subjects have 
completed the Day 180 visit or withdrew early from the study .  The primary efficacy analysis on ORR at 
Day 28 will be conducted first; the sponsor will consider stopping the study if conditional power is 
< 20%.  If the efficacy boundary is crossed, the primary efficacy objective is considered achieved , and the 
key secondary analysis on NRM at Day 180 will be conducted.

1. INTRODUCTION 
1.1. Overview of Acute Graft-V ersus -Host Disease  
Allogeneic HSCT is an effective immunotherapy for human cancer  (Appelbaum 2007).  More 
than 32,000 allo-HSCTs are performed each year worldwide, primarily for the treatment of 
hematologic malignancies  (Niederwieser  et al 2016 ).  Acute GVHD and cGVHD re main  major 
contributors to transplantation -related deaths and the most significant barrier to successful  
allo-HSCT.  GVHD occurs when donor- derived immune cells recognize the transplant recipient 
(the host) as foreign, thereby initiating an immune reaction and subsequent inflamma tory 
cascade that results in varying degrees of tissue damage and potential organ failure in the transplant recipient.  Despite prophylactic treatments with immunosuppressive agents, approximately 50% of transplantation recipients develop GVHD.  Risk factors associated with 
aGVHD include donor/recipient HLA mismatch, increased age (donor or recipient), sex, 
intensity of the pretransplant conditioning regimen, and donor source ( Jagasia et al 2012, 
Flower s et al 2011).  Most GVH reactions are undesirable and affect multiple organs; however, 
GVH reactions against hematopoietic tissue targets are desirable and critical for the cure of 
hematologic malignancies (ie , the GVT effect ) and for donor immune- hemato poietic system 
engraftment .  These disparate effects of GVH reactions are difficult to separate, and any 
strategies directed against GVHD may adversely affect survival by increasing malignancy relapse, graft rejection, and  the frequency and severity of infections
 (Pavletic and Fowler 2012). 
There are few therapeutic studies for aGVHD, and currently no agents are approved by the FDA 
for either prevention or treatment of aGVHD (Martin  et al 2009).  At diagnosis, the extent of 
individual organ involvement and overall grade of aGVHD should be documented, taking into account all organ involvement, as this has prognostic significance.  Acute GVHD diagnosis 
should be confirmed by biopsy of an affected organ if possible; in addition, other non- GVHD 
complications involving the skin, liver, and GI tract should be ruled out.  Although diagnostic 
biopsies are highly specific if current histopathology criteria are used, the sensitivity of t hese 
biopsies is only approximately 60%; therefore, the ultimate aGVHD diagnosis and decision to 
treat systemically is based on careful integration of all available clinical informatio n 
(Weisdorf et  al 2003). 
The classic target organs for aGVHD are the skin (severity ranging from maculopapular rash to 
erythroderma and bullae formation), the GI  tract (resulting in nausea, vomiting, abdominal 
cramps, or diarrhea), and the liver (resulting in hyperbilirubinemia, jaundice , or elevated 
transaminases).  The hematopoietic system can also be targeted, resulting in complete donor lymphohematopoietic chimerism and the GVT  response against hematologic malignancies.  
Endothelium, lungs, and other organs can also be targeted, although skin, gut, and liver 
involvement are the only organs scored in the current grading system. 
The severity of aGVHD is graded according to the degree of involvement of the skin, liver, and 
GI tract.  Two of the more traditionally -used grading syste ms are the Glucksberg system (I -IV, 
Glucksberg et al 1974) and the International Bone Marrow Transplant Research system (A-D; 
Rowlings et al 199 7).  These grading systems  have evolved over time through the efforts of NIH 
working groups to reflect the inclusion of persistent nausea with histologic evidence of GVHD as

Protocol INCB 39110- 301 Am 4 Version 4 13 AUG 2018  
Stage 1 upper GI  aGVHD ( Przepiorka et al 1995) and standardization of collect ing of complex 
clinical data from multiple organ systems ( Harris  et al 2016).  
It has been  well -established that patients with severe (clinical Grades III-IV) aGVHD are less 
responsive to steroids, leading to poor er survival and high er transplant- related mortality than 
patients with Grade I  to II disease.   However, clinical observations suggest there is a subset of 
moderately severe (Grade II) patients who are at higher risk of treatment -related mortality  
compared with patients with standard -risk aGVHD ( MacMillan  et al 2015 ).  The limited efficacy 
observed with current therapeutic options highlights the need to identify more effective treatment 
for these patients.  
1.2. First -Line Treatm ent of Acute GVHD 
Current guidelines from the American Society for Bone Marrow Transplant and the European 
Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation recommend the use of methylprednisolone 
2 mg/kg per day (or an equivalent dose of prednisone) as the start ing dose for patients with 
Grades II to IV aGVHD; lower doses may be appropriate for patients with Grade II dis ease 
depending on risk status.  Corticosteroids are therefore considered the current standard care for 
aGVHD and will be used as background treatment in this study.  Tapering of corticosteroids 
should begin as soon as the manifestations of GVHD begin to show substantial improvement (Martin  et al 2012, Ruutu et al 2014). 
Because only approximately 50 % of aGVHD patients respond to systemic steroids and many of 
these responses are not durable, attempts have been made to evaluate the addition of other agents 
to corticosteroids, including antibodies directed against IL-2R, high-dose steroids, horse 
antithymocyte globulin , anti–tumor necrosis factor drugs, mycophenolate mofetil , pentostatin, 
and sirolimus ( Cahn  et al  1995, Lee et al 2004, Cragg  et al 2000, Couriel et al 2009, Levine et al 
2008, Alousi et al 2009, Pidala  et al 2009).  In most cases, the second agent yielded modest  
benefit ; a study of daclizumab found the additional intervention to be detrimental.  Thus, the use 
of methylprednisolone or prednisone remains the standard first -line treatment for the initial 
treatment of aGVHD, but new treatment options that provide more durable responses and less 
immunosuppression- related toxicities are needed.  
1.3. Itacitinib  Background 
Itacitinib adipate is a novel, potent, and selective inhibitor of the JAK family of protein TYKs 
with selectivity for JAK1.  Itacitinib is an investigational product that is proposed for 
development for treatment of MPNs, including MF; inflammatory diseases, including RA and 
psoriasis; GVHD; solid tumors; and B -cell malignancies.  Janus kinases play an important role in 
signal transduction following cytokine and growth factor binding to their receptors.  Aberrant 
production of cytokines and growth factors has been associated with MPNs and a number of 
chronic inflammatory conditions, and JAK1 has been shown to cooperate with other JAKs to 
mediate the signaling of a number of inflammatory cytokines.  Therefore, JAK inhibitors represent potential therapeutic agents for these disease states (refer to the IB).

Protocol INCB 39110- 301 Am 4 Version 4 13 AUG 2018  
1.3.1. Pharmacology 
Itacitinib potently inhibits JAK1 (IC 50 = 3.6 nM at 1 mM adenosine triphosphate concentration), 
with 22- to > 500-fold selectivity over the other JAK family members, JAK2, JAK3, and TYK2.  
It does not significantly inhibit (< 30% inhibition) a broad panel of approximately 60 other 
kinases.  Itacitinib is also potent ( IC50 values of approximately 10 nM to 350 nM) in 
cytokine- driven cell -based assays.  This effect is not due to general cytotoxicity.  Itacitinib also 
inhibits the growth of the cytokine- dependent cell lin e INA -6.  Itacitinib potently inhibits the 
phosphorylation of STAT proteins and the production of proinflammatory factors induced by other cytokines, such as IL- 23 and IL -6 with IC
50 values of approximately 30 nM to 100 nM.  In 
contrast, itacitinib shows less inhibition in cell-based assays dependent on JAK2 with IC50 values 
of approximately 1 μM or greater, suggesting that itacitinib is JAK2 sparing in cells.  In in vivo  
models of JAK dependent malignancy, itacitinib impedes subcutaneous tumor growth of INA-6 
cells expressing wild-type JAKs when administered by continuous infusion, achieving plasma 
concentrations well below those necessary to inhibit JAK2.  Oral itacitinib also reduced 
splenomegaly in a model of JAK2 V617F–driven neoplasia relevant to MF. 
Additional details on pharmacology and toxicology may be found in the IB. 
1.3.2. Clinical Studies  
As of 13 DEC 2017, 9 clinical studies with itacitinib have been completed: 4 studies in healthy 
subjects; 2 monotherapy proof-of- concept studies in subjects with active rheumatoid arthritis  
and stable, chronic plaque psoriasis; and 3 combination studies (itacitinib + gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel in subjects with advanced or metastatic solid tumors; itacitinib + docetaxel in 
subjects with previously treated Stage IIIB, Stage IV, or recurrent NSCLC; and itacitinib + 
INCB040093 in subjects with relapsed or refractory Hodgkin lymphoma).  Additional details 
regarding the design  and results  of these studies are summarized in the  IB. 
As of the clinical data cutoff date, 967 unique subjects have been exposed to itacitinib; this does not include 9 subjects enrolled in an ongoing, blinded, placebo-controlled study.  The most 
frequently reported TEAEs (≥ 20%) for itacitinib monotherapy in subjects with underlying disease and in various treatment combinations are presented in the IB. 
1.4. Study Rationale  
1.4.1. Animal Studies in Acute GVHD Models  
To determine the role of JAK/STAT signaling in GVHD, MHC -mismatched allo -HSCT was 
performed in mice [B6 (H-2b) to Balb/c(H -2d)].  In this model, IFN- γR signaling was shown to 
play a major role in T -cell trafficking to GVHD target organs via CXCR3 .  Mice transplanted 
with IFN-γR -/- T cells had improved survival and less clinical GVHD compared with mice 
transplanted with wild -type T cells .  Further more, pharmacologic inhibition of interferon 
signal ing with a JAK/STAT  signaling inhibitor, ruxolitinib, for 20 days resulted in the decr eased 
expression of CXCR3, reduced GVHD, and improved survival after allo- HSCT in mice 
(Figure  1; Choi et al 2012 ).

Protocol INCB 39110- 301 Am 4 Version 4 13 AUG 2018  
In a separate study, in vivo  JAK/STAT signaling inhibition improved survival of mice 
developing aGVHD and reduced histopathological GVHD grading, serum levels of 
proinflammatory c ytokines, and expansion of alloreactive luc- transgenic T cells 
(Choi et  al 2012). 
It was shown that the JAK1/2 inhibitor ruxolitinib impaired differentiation of CD4+ T cells into 
IFN-γ and IL-17A–producing cells and that both T-cell phenotypes are linked to GVHD.  
Additionally, ruxolitinib treatment in allo -HSCT recipients increased FoxP3+ Tregs , which are 
linked to immunologic tolerance. 
When tested in the same preclinical model of GVHD as described above for ruxolitinib, 
preliminary results with  itacitinib  showed similar pharmacologic inhibition of interferon 
signaling, resulting in the decreased expression of CXCR3, reduced GVHD, and improved 
survival after allo -HSCT in mice when dosed for 30 days ( Figure  3).

1.4.2. Clinical Experience With  JAK Inhibitors for the Treatment of  GVHD  
Clinical experience with ruxolitinib in patients with steroid -refractory GVHD was initially 
reported in 6 patients based on a prospective protocol ( Spoerl et al 2014).  Results were updated 
in a retrospective analysis of 95 patients with steroid- refractory aGVHD (n = 54, all Grade III or 
IV) or steroid -refractory cGVHD (n  = 41, all moderate or severe) who were treated with 
ruxolitinib at a dose of 5 to 10 mg BID ( Zeiser  et al 2015).  Of the 54 patients with aGVHD (all 
of whom with Grade 3 or 4 disease), an ORR of 81.5% was reported, including 25 CRs (46.3%).  
The median TTR  was 1.5 weeks (range 1 -11) after initiation of ruxolitinib therapy.  In addition, a 
6-month survival estimate of 79% (67.3%-90.7%, 95% CI) was reported, with a median follow-
up time of 26.5 weeks.  GVHD relapses  were repor ted in 6.8% (3/44) of patients.  A significant 
decline in levels of IL -6 and soluble IL -2 receptor were observed in 12 of 25 evaluable patients 
treated at one center.  Cytomegalovirus reactivation was observed in 33.3% (18/54) of aGVHD 
patients and was con trolled using antiviral therapy , while ruxolitinib treatment continued.  
Cytopenias were also observed during treatment with ruxolitinib in 55.5% (30/54) of patients; 
however, cytopenias were reported before treatment with ruxolitinib in 51.7% (28/54).  Malignancy relapse was reported in 9.3% (5/54).  After additional follow -up (median follow-up 
of 19 and 24 months for patients with aG VHD and cGVHD, respectively), 1 -year OS rates of 
62.4% (CI:  49.4%-75.4%) and 92.7% (CI:  84.7%-100%) were reported for SR-a GVHD and 
SR-cGVHD, respectively.   The median duration of ruxolitinib treatment was 5 and 10 months for 
patients with SR -aGVHD and SR -cGVHD, respectively reflecting the different biology of the 
diseases ( Zeiser  et al 2016 ). 
In a Phase 1 study that assessed the safety and tolerability of itacitinib  in combination with 
corticosteroids, 30 aGVHD  subjects were randomized to 1 of 2 treatment cohorts (200 mg 
cohort, n = 14; 300 mg cohort, n = 16).  One subject was randomized to the 300 mg cohort but withdrew from the study before  starting treatment.  One DLT of Grade 3 thrombocytopenia was 
reported in 1 subject with pre-existing thrombocytopenia who was randomized to the 300 mg 
cohort.  Adverse events reported in greater than 20% of all subjects include diarrhea, 
hypokalemia, peripheral edema, hyperglycemia, abdominal pain, hypophosphatemia, fatigue, 
headache, hypomagnesemia, and sepsis.  Thrombocytopenia and platelet count decreases were observed in 24.2% and 20.7% of subjects, respectively, with a higher proportion of these events 
occurring in the 300 mg cohort, although a higher incidence of pre-existing thrombocytopenia 
was also observed in this group.  The Day 28 ORR in first -line aGVHD subjects in both 
treatment cohorts was 83.3% ; for subjects with SR- aGVHD, the overall Day 28 ORR was 64.7% 
(200 mg cohort, 62.5%; 300 mg cohort, 66.7%).  Most respons es occurred within the first 
14 days of treatment, and responses were durable, with a median DOR  of 130 days and 136 days 
in the 200 mg cohort and 300 mg cohort, respectively.  Complete response rates of 66.7% and 
17.6% were reported for first-line and SR -aGVHD cohorts, respectively.  Pharmacokinetics of 
itacitinib  were evaluated using plasma samples collected predose and at 1 hour, 2 hours, and 4 to 
8 hours postdose on Study Days 1 and 7.  Although intersubject variability was found to be high, 
PK exposure (C
max and AUC) was consistent with historical data , and a large overlap in 
steady -state exposure was observed between the 200 mg and 300 mg cohorts.  The higher 
incidence of thrombocytopenia and DLT of thrombocytopenia in the 300 mg cohort, as well as similarities in PK and efficacy between dose groups , led to the identification of the 200 mg dose 
of itacitinib  as the recommended phase 2 dose for future GVHD studies ( Schroeder et al 2016).   
The treatment compliance rate and median duration of treatment were also higher in the 200 mg

3. SUBJECT ELIGIBILITY  
Deviations from eligibility criteria are not allowed , because they can potentially jeopardize the 
scientific integrity of the study, regulatory acceptability, and/or subject safety.  Therefore, 
adherence to the criteria as specified in the Protocol is essential.  
3.1. Subject Inclusion Criteria  
A subject  who meet s all of the following criteria may be included  in the study: 
1. Male or female, 18 years of age or older; outside the European Union, an  older limit 
could apply depending on local regulation ( eg, 20 years and older for Taiwan and Japan ). 
2. Has undergone 1 allo -HSCT  from any donor ( related or unrelated with  any degree of 
HLA matching ) and any donor source (bone marrow, peripheral blood stem cells, or cord 
blood) for a hematologic malignancy or disorder .  Recipients of myeloablative and 
reduced -intensity conditioning regimens are eligible.  
3. Clinically suspecte d Grade II to IV a GVHD as per MAGIC  criteria, occurring after 
allo-HSC T and any GVHD prophylaxis regimen .  Biopsies should be obtained to 
pathologically confirm aGVHD; in cases where a biopsy is negative, is unable to be 
obtained, or is clinically contraindicated, clinical suspicion of aGVHD by the treating physician is sufficient, provided that alternative diagnoses of drug effects or infection are 
adequately ruled out. 
4. Evidence of myeloid engraftment (eg, ANC ≥ 0.5 × 10
9/L for 3 consecutive assessments 
if ablative therapy was previously used).  Use of growth factor supplementation is 
allowed.  
5. Be willing to avoid pregnancy or fathering children based on 1 of the following criteria: 
a. Women of nonchildbearing potential (ie, surgically sterile with a hysterectomy an d/or 
bilateral oophorectomy OR ≥ 12 months of amenorrhea). 
b. Woman of childbearing potential who has a negative serum pregnancy test at 
screening and who agrees to take appropriate precautions to avoid pregnancy (with at least 99% certainty) from screening t hrough safety follow-up.  Permitted methods that 
are at least 99% effective in preventing pregnancy (see Appendix A ) should be 
communicated to the subject and their understanding confirmed.

JAK inhibitor before allo- HSCT is permitted.  
14. Treatment with any other investigational agent, device, or procedure, within 21 days (or 
5 half -lives, whichever is greater) of enrollment.  Subjects participating in  a GVHD 
prophylaxis study or conditioning regimen should be discussed with the sponsor' s 
medical monitor before enrollment.  
15. Any medical complications or conditions that would, in the investigator's judgment, 
interfere with full participation in the study, including administration of study drug and 
attending required study visits; pose a significant risk to the subject; or interfere with interpretation of study data. 
16. Known allergies, hypersensitivity, or intolerance to any of the study medications, 
excipient s, or similar compounds. 
3.3. Lifestyle Considerations  
3.3.1. Meals and Dietary Restrictions  
Subjects should be instructed to re frain from the consumption of pomegranates or pomegranate 
juice and grapefruit or grapefruit juice, as these are known to inhibit cytochrome CYP3A enzymes and may increase the exposure to itacitinib.  
3.3.2. Activity  
No restrictions are required.  
4. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
4.1. Overall Study Design  
This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter Phase 3 study of itacitinib  or 
placebo in combination with corticosteroids as first -line treatment of subjects with Grade II to IV 
aGVHD.  Subjects will be randomized 1:1 to itacitinib 200 mg plus corticosteroids or matching 
placebo plus corticosteroids.  Randomization will be stratifie d by GVHD risk s tatus  (ie, standard 
risk vs high  risk; MacMillan  et al 2015; Appendix C ).  Subjects will receive randomized study 
treatment until treatment failure (progression of disease , no response, or requiring additional 
systemic therapy), unacceptable toxicity, or death.  Transfusion support and continued use of 
anti-infective medications, GVHD prophylaxis medications (including calcineurin inhibitors), 
and topical steroid therapy are permitted.  
GVHD staging and grading  will be assessed for efficacy as per MAGIC  criteria ( Harris  et al 
2016) ; safety and tolerability will be assessed as per NCI CTCAE v4.03  (NCI 2009).  
An independent DMC will perform a futility -only interim  analysis for primary analysis  on ORR 
at Day 28  once 112 subjects (56 per cohort) have completed the Day 28 visit or withdrew early 
CONFIDENTIAL  
Incyte Corporation  Page 29 of 92 
Protocol INCB 39110- 301 Am 4 Version 4 13 AUG 2018  
from the study.  If the futility boundary is crossed, the sponsor will consider stopping the study 
for futility .  Otherwise, a second interim analysis on ORR at Day 28 for primary analysis will be 
conducted for both efficacy and futility once 240 subjects have completed the Day 180 visit or 
withdrew early from the study.  If neither the futility nor efficacy boundary is crossed, the study 
will continue to accrue approximately 436 subjects and then the final analysis for the primary 
analysis will be conducted using CMH test.  The study will end once 75% of subjects have 
achieved 2- year transplant- related mortality , have died, or have been  lost to follow -up.  
4.2. Measures Taken to Avoid Bias  
Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio  to receive itacitinib  plus corticosteroids or matching 
placebo  plus corticosteroids an d will be stratified by GVHD risk status  (ie, standard -risk versus 
high-risk; MacMillan  et al 2015;  Appendix C ).  Centra lized randomization numbers within each 
stratum will be created fo r treatment assignment.   Subjects, investigators, and the study team will 
be blinded to treatment assignment.  A sponsor statistician who is not part of the study team will be unblinded and may provide summary aggregated data by treatment cohort to the sponsor and/or the DMC, but individual subject data will remain blinded. 
Disease assessments and safety assessments will be performed in accordance with standardized 
criteria.  
4.3. Number of Subjects  
4.3.1. Planned Number of Subjects  
This study will enroll approximately 218 subjects with clinically or pathologically confirmed  
Grade II  to IV aGVHD per treatment cohort, for a total of 436 subjects  at approximately 85 study 
sites.  
4.3.2. Replacement of Subjects  
Not applicable.  
4.4. Duration of Treatment and Subject Participation  
After s igning the ICF, screening assessments may be completed over a period of up to 28 days.  
Each subject enrolled in the study may continue to receive study treatment as long as benefit is 
being observed and/or treatment withdrawal criteria are not met.  I f the subject discontinues 
study treatment, the treatment period will end , and the subject will enter  the follow-up period 
(see Section  6.4).  The safety foll ow-up period will last 30 to 35 days, and the survival follow-up 
period will last until death or study withdrawal.  Study participation is expected to average 
approximately 12 months per individual subject but may vary based on clinical outcomes. 
4.5. Overall Study Duration  
The study begins when the first subject signs the informed consent.  S ubjects who are still 
on-study at the time of the primary  endpoint analysis will continue to receive study treatment  
until treatment withdrawal criteria are met  (Section  5.5).  All subjects will be follo wed for 
survival until death, withdrawal of consent, or the end of the study, whichever occurs first.  The 
study will end once 75% of subjects have died  or are lost to follow -up.  Provisions will be made 
CONFIDENTIAL  
Incyte Corporation  Page 30 of 92 
Protocol INCB 39110- 301 Am 4 Version 4 13 AUG 2018  
to ensure access to treatment for subjects who are continuing to benefit from study treatment at 
the time of study completion.  
4.6. Study Termination  
The investigator retains the right to terminate study participation at any time, according to the 
terms specified in the study contract.  The investigator is to notify the institutional review board 
(IRB)/independent ethics committee (IEC)  in writing of the study 's completion or early 
termination , send a copy of the notification to the sponsor or sponsor's designee, and retain 
1 copy for the site study regulatory file.  
The sponsor may terminate the study electively, if required by regulatory decision, or upon 
advice of the DMC .  If the study is terminated prematurely, the sponsor will notify the 
investigators, the IRBs and I ECs, and the regulatory bodies of the decision and reason for 
termination of the study.  The DMC  will recommend termination of the study if warranted, as 
described in Section  8.7. 
5. TREATMENT  
5.1. Study Drug and Treatment Assignment  
5.1.1. Subject Numbering and Treatment Assignment  
Each subject will be identified in the study by a subject ID number, which is a combination of 
the site ID and subject number.  Site staff should contact the IVRS to obtain the subject ID number during screening. 
Site staff will contact the IVRS to randomize the subject and obtain the initial study drug 
assignment.  The investigator or designee will select the assigned bottles of study drug from their stock that correspond to the number provided by the IVRS, record the bottle numbers in the 
eCRF, and dispense the study drug to the subject.  All subsequent dispensing of study drug 
should follow this process.  Full details will be provided in the IVRS manual. 
All subject numbers will be 6 digits; the first 3 digits will be the site number and the last 3 digits 
will be the subject's number.  This subject number will be maintained throughout the study and 
will not be reassigned.  Subjects who withdraw consent or discontinue from the study after being assigned a subject number will r etain their initial number.  
If a subject is mistakenly given a bottle of study drug that is not the bottle assigned by the IVRS, then the IVRS help desk must be notified immediately.  The reason for the misallocation of the study drug must be documented by the study site.  
For subjects who signed an ICF but are not allocated and for subjects who are allocated but were not treated, refer to the eCRF Completion Guidelines for instruction on which eCRFs to complete.  
5.1.2. Randomization and Blinding  
Randomization will occur centrally by IVRS.  Full instructions will be provided in the IVRS  
manual .  Randomization will be stratified by standard risk and high risk ( MacMillan  et al 2015;  
CONFIDENTIAL  
Incyte Corporation  Page 31 of 92 
Protocol INCB 39110- 301 Am 4 Version 4 13 AUG 2018  
Appendix C ) at a ratio of 1:1.  As this is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 
neither investigators, nor the sponsor will be aware of the treatment cohort to which the subject 
is randomized. 
5.2. Study Drugs  
5.2.1. Itacitinib /Placebo  
5.2.1.1. Description and Administration  
Itacitinib  100 mg ( free base  equivalent) sustained -release tablets contain the active ingredient, 
hypromellose, microcrystalline cellulose, lactose monoh ydrate, and magnesium stearate.    
Placebo tablets developed to match the itacitinib 100 mg sustained -release  tablets are similar in 
appearance to active drug product tablets with regard to color, size, and shape and contain 
hypromellose, microcrystalline cellulose, and magnesium stearate . 
Itacitinib  or placebo will be administered PO at a sta rting dose of 200 mg QD (2 × 100 mg 
tablets) . 
Subjects may have dose reductions or modifications of itacitinib  or placebo  during the course of 
treatment based on AEs, clinical evaluation, and laboratory assessments.  See Section  5.4 for 
dose modifications of study drug. 
Subjects are permitted to remain on itacitinib  or placebo treatment until withdrawal from study 
treatment is considered necessary as per Section  5.5. 
5.2.1.2. Supply, Packaging, and Labeling 
Itacitinib  or placebo tablets will be provided to sites in high- density polyethylene bottles  as 
applicable by Incyte .  No preparation is required. 
All Incyte investigational product labels will be in the local language and will comply with the 
legal requirements of each country. 
5.2.1.3. Storage 
Itacitinib  or placebo should be stored at ambient conditions (15°C to 30°C, or 59°F to 86°F) as 
per the IB. 
5.2.1.4. Instruction to Subjects for Handling Itacitini b or Placebo  
The subject must be instructed in the handling of itacitinib  or placebo as follows:  
• To store the bottles at room temperature, in a safe place and out of the reach of 
children . 
• To only remove the number of tablets needed at the time of administration. 
• Not to remove tablets  in advance of the next scheduled administration. 
• To make every effort to take doses on schedule. 
• To report any missed doses. 
CONFIDENTIAL  
Incyte Corporation  Page 32 of 92 
Protocol INCB 39110- 301 Am 4 Version 4 13 AUG 2018  
• To take tablets  with a glass of water.  
• Not to take another dose if vomiting occurs after taking study  medication.  
• To refrain from taking study medication on the day of clinic visits until after blood 
samples are collected . 
• To fast on PK assessment days (Days 1, 7, and 28). 
• To bring all used and unused bottles of study medication  to the site at each visit.  
5.2.2. Corticosteroids  
Either oral prednisone or intravenous methylprednisolone may be used to begin standard 
corticosteroi d background treatment at the investigator 's discretion. 
5.2.2.1. Prednisone  
5.2.2.1.1. Description  
Prednisone is a white to off-white, odorless, crystalline powder.  Tablets are typically white in 
color and contain lactose monohydrate, magnesium stearate, microcrystalline cellulose, pregelatinized starch, and  sodium starch glycolate.  Commonly available dose strengths include 
1 mg, 2.5 mg, 5 mg, 10 mg, 20 mg, a nd 50 mg tablets. 
5.2.2.1.2. Supply, Packaging, and Labeling  
Investigators are responsible for ensuring that subjects receive commercially available supplies 
of prednisone for the duration of the study treatment period.  Incyte may provide prednisone 
where required by applicable law or regulation. 
5.2.2.1.3. Storage 
Prednisone tablets should be stored in accordance with local prescribing information 
requirements.  
5.2.2.2. Methylprednisolone  
5.2.2.2.1. Description  
Methylprednisolone sterile powder is an anti- inflammatory glucocorticoid, which conta ins 
methylprednisolone sodium succinate as the active ingredient.  Methylprednisolone sodium succinate, USP, is the sodium succinate ester of methylprednisolone, and it occurs as a white, or 
nearly white, odorless hygroscopic, amorphous solid.  It is very soluble in water and in alcohol; 
it is insoluble in chloroform and is very slightly soluble in acetone. 
5.2.2.2.2. Supply, Packaging, and Labeling  
Investigators are responsible for ensuring that subjects receive commercially available supplies 
of methylprednisolone for the duration of the study treatment period.  Incyte may provide 
methylprednisolone where required by applicable law or regulation. 
CONFIDENTIAL  
Incyte Corporation  Page 33 of 92 
Protocol INCB 39110- 301 Am 4 Version 4 13 AUG 2018  
5.2.2.2.3. Storage 
Methylprednisolone (unreconstituted product or solution) should be stored in accordance with 
local prescribing information.  
5.2.3. Starting Dose and Administration of Corticosteroids 
All subjects will receive methylprednisolone 2 mg/kg IV daily  (or prednisone equivalent) or at  a 
dose that is appropriate for the severity of disease as outlined per local treatment guidelines (Martin  et al 2012, Ruutu et al 2014) as background treatment .  Subjects who previously began 
corticosteroid therapy at a different dose may remain on that dose if considered clinically appropriate by the treating physician.  Corticosteroids  should be tapered as per institutional 
guidelines at a rate that is commensurate with resolution of GVHD manifestations.  
If GVHD flares during the taper of prednisone or methylprednisolone, the dose may be  
re-escalated at the investigator 's discretion and will not be considered treatment failure, as long 
as the dose does not exceed the initial starting dose.   If the dose required exceeds this threshold, 
or if the flare is not responsive to increased cortico steroids or multiple flares are observed, then 
the subject will be considered to have experienced treatment failure and be withdrawn from study treatment.  
5.2.4. Prophylactic and Supportive Care Medications 
Patients  who undergo allo- HSCT  are at risk for a variety  of infections based on the degree of 
immunosuppression induced by the conditioning regimen before transplant.  As such, it is considered routine practice to use antibiotics, anti-infectives, and immunizations as prophylactic 
therapies ( Tomblyn et al  2009).  In cases where post -transplant anti-infective prophylaxis 
measures are necessary, ongoing therapy may continue at the investigator 's discretio n per 
institutional guidelines.  
Systemic and topical GVHD prophylaxis me dications ( eg, cyclosporine, methotrexate, and 
tacrolimus ) may be continued at therapeutic doses as appropriate based on stage and sites of 
disease.  
Additional supportive care measures ( eg, use of antimotility  agents for diarrhea management , 
topical steroids, beclomethasone, budesonide, ursodiol ) are permitted at the investigator 's 
discretion. 
See Section  5.5.4 for additional details . 
5.3. Treatment Compliance  
Treatment compliance with all study -related medications sho uld be emphasized to the subject by 
the site personnel, and appropriate steps should be taken to optimize compliance during the 
study.  Itacitinib  or placebo compliance will be calculated, by the sponsor, based on the drug 
accountability documented by the site staff and monitored by the sponsor/designee (tablet 
counts).  Subjects will be instructed to bring all study- related medications with them to each 
study visit in order for site personnel to conduct tablet counts to assess study drug accountability.  The drug accountability documentation will be used by the sponsor to calculate treatment compliance.  
CONFIDENTIAL  
Incyte Corporation  Page 34 of 92 
Protocol INCB 39110- 301 Am 4 Version 4 13 AUG 2018  
Although commercial supplies of corticosteroids will be used, dose changes and interruptions 
will also be documented in the medical record and monitored by the sponsor or its designee.  As 
corticosteroid dose strengths and administration types will vary, compliance with corticosteroids 
will not be calculated.  
5.4. Treatment Interruptions and Adjustments  
5.4.1. Dose Modifications 
Dose interruptions and modifications may o ccur for individual study subjects based on the 
emergence or resolution of toxicity.  
5.4.2. Criteria and Procedures for Dose Interruptions and Adjustments of Study Drug  
Treatment with itacitinib /placebo  may be delayed up to 14 days to allow for resolution of 
toxicity.  After interruption, subjects  should be evaluated on a weekly basis until 
resolution/improvement of the AE .  Subjects may resume treatment if no medical condition or 
other circumstance exists that, in the opinion of the investigator, would make the s ubject 
unsuitable for further participation in the study.  The investigator should contact the medical 
monitor to discuss cases where treatment has been delayed for more than 14 days before 
restarting treatment.  
Because subjects may enter the study with co mpromised bone marrow function, these dose 
reductions are provided as guidelines (see Table 1 and Table 2); individual decisions regarding 
dose reduction should be made using clinical judgment and an  individual benefit/risk assessment, 
taking into account relatedness of the AE to the study drug and the subject's underlying condition.  Adverse events that have a clear alternative explanation or transient (≤ 72 hours) 
abnormal laboratory values without associated clinically significant signs or symptoms may be exempt from dose-reduction rules.  The sponsor' s medic al monitor  may be consulted for advice. 
Subjects receiving itacitinib /placebo  at a dose of 200 mg QD may have their  dose reduced to 
100 mg QD.  Subjects who are unable to tolerate itacitinib /placebo  at a dose of 100 mg QD 
should be withdrawn from study tre atment.  
CONFIDENTIAL  
Incyte Corporation  Page 37 of 92 
Protocol INCB 39110- 301 Am 4 Version 4 13 AUG 2018  
would be withdrawn from study treatment.  A physiologic dose of 6 to 8 mg/day of 
methylprednisolone (ie , 7.5-10 mg/day of prednisone) during itacitinib/placebo taper is allowed 
and will not be considered treatment f ailure. 
If subjects completely taper off itacitinib /placebo  and GVHD signs/symptoms reappear at a later 
time, subjects may enter the re- treatment phase at the investigator’s discretion  (Section  6.4). 
Assessments would be performed as per the re- treatment assessment schedule listed in Table 3. 
5.4.4. Criteria for Permanent Discontinuation of Study Drug  
The occurrence of unacceptable toxicity not caused by the underlying disease or malignancy will 
be presumed to be related to study drug treatment and will require that the study drug be 
permanently discontinued.  Unacceptable toxicity is defined as follows: 
• Occurrence of an AE that is related to treatment with the study drug that , in the 
judgment of the investigator or the sponsor's medical monitor, compromises the subject 's ability to continue study -specific procedures or is considered to not be in the 
subject 's best interest.  
• Persistent AE requiring a delay of therapy for more than 14 days, unless a greater 
delay has been approved by the sponsor. 
5.4.5. Criteria and Procedures for Dose Interruptions or Adjustments of  
Corticosteroids  
Adjustments to the dose of corticosteroids should be made at the treating investigator' s 
discretion. 
5.5. Withdraw al of Subjects From Study Treatment  
The decision to discontinue study treatment will not constitute study completion ( see 
Section  5.5.3).  In the event that the decision is made to discontinue study treatment, the 
treatment period will be considered complete , and the follow-up period will begin.  
5.5.1. Withdrawal Criteria  
Subjects must  be withdrawn from study treatment for the following reasons: 
• The subject has experienced an unacceptable toxicity . 
• Relapse of underlying malignancy . 
• The subject is unable to tolerate itacitinib /placebo  at a dose of 100 mg QD . 
• Additional systemic therapy is required for GVHD progression or lack of response, 
including corticosteroid doses greater than those used on Study Day 1. 
• Further partic ipation would be injurious to the subject' s health or well -being, in the 
investigator 's medical judgment. 
• The subject becomes pregnant. 
• Consent is withdrawn. 
CONFIDENTIAL  
Incyte Corporation  Page 38 of 92 
Protocol INCB 39110- 301 Am 4 Version 4 13 AUG 2018  
• The study is terminated by the sponsor. 
• The study is terminated by the local health authority , IRB, or IEC. 
A subject  may be withdrawn from study treatment as follows: 
• If, during the course of the study, a subject is found not to have met eligibility 
criteria, then the medical monitor, in collaboration with the investigator, will 
determine whether the subject should be withdrawn from the study. 
• If a subject is noncompliant with study procedures or study drug administration in the investigator 's opinion, the sponsor should be consulted for instruction on handling the 
subject.  
5.5.2. Withdrawal Procedures  
In the event that the decision is made to permanently discontinue the study drug, the subject will 
be withdrawn from the study and the EOT visit should be conducted.  Reasonable efforts should 
be made to have the subject return for a follow-up visit as  described  in Section  6.  The last date 
of the last dose of study drug and the reason for subject withdrawal will be recorded in the eCRF. 
If a subject is withdrawn from study treatment:  
• The study monitor or sponsor must be notified. 
• The reason(s) for withdrawal must be documented in the subject' s medical record and 
in the eCRF.  
• The EOT  visit should be performed. 
• The date of the EOT visit should be registered in the IVRS. 
• Subjects must be followed for safety until the time of the follow-up visit or until 
study drug–related toxicities resolve, return to baseline, or are deemed irreversible, 
whichever is longest.  
If the subject discontinues study treatment and actively withdraws consent for collection of follow- up data (safety  follow-up or disease assessment), then no additional data collection 
should occur; however, subjects will have the option of withdrawing consent for study treatment 
but continuing in the follow-up period of the study for safety/efficacy assessments. 
5.5.3. Study  Completion 
A subject will be considered as completing the study if they meet any of the following criteria:  
• Subject dies and a date of death is available.  
• Subject is known to have died; however, the date of death cannot be obtained.  
(NOTE:  Every effort must be made to obtain the date of death.) 
• Subject has discontinued study treatment and has withdrawn consent for collection of 
follow-up anticancer  and survival data.

5.5.4. Concomitant Medications  
5.5.4.1. Permitted Medications  
Concomitant treatments and/or procedures t hat are required to manage a subject 's medical 
condition (including prophylactic and/or supportive care medications as described in 
Section  5.2.3) during the study will also be recorded in the e CRF.  
5.5.4.2. Restricted Medications  
The following medications have restrictions on use during the treatment period of the study: 
• Aspirin in doses exceeding 125 mg  per day is not permitted.  Low -dose aspi rin 
(≤ 125 mg  per day ) is permitted unless clinically contraindicated.  
• Coadmini stration  with the following potent CYP3A4 in hibitors :  itraconazol e, 
voriconazole, mibefradil, and clarithromy cin; if the subject 's medical condition 
requires treatment with any of these drugs, dose reduc tion of itacitinib to 100  mg QD 
is recommended, as m ore potent inhibitors have been shown to increase exposure to 
itacitinib.  The sponsor 's medical monitor may be consulted for advice when using 
these agents.   
No dose adjustment is recommended for concomitant administration of other 
CYP3A4 inhibitors  ( Appendix D ). 
• Coadministration  with CYP3A4 inducers ( Appendix D ). 
• If concomitant administration of an anticoagulant/antiplatelet medication is indicated, then caution and enhanced monitoring is required.  History of thrombocytopenia 
should be a factor in the choice of anticoagulant and dose. 
5.5.4.3. Prohibited Medications  
The following medications are prohibited during the treatment period of the study: 
• Any concurrent anticancer the rapy ( eg, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, surgery, 
immunotherapy, biologic therapy) intended to treat malignancy relapse or recurrence.  Maintenance therapy with tyrosine kinase inhibitors for high- risk Philadelphia 
chromosome −positive leukemia and FLT3 inhibitors for FLT3+ acute myeloid 
leukemia ma y be used with sponsor approval. 
• Any secondary GVHD therapy due to insufficient response/progression on study treatment .  
• Concomitant use of targeted therapies wi th anti- GVHD activity , including but not 
limited to tumor necrosis factor alpha inhibitors and IL-6 receptor  inhibitors. 
• Concomitant use of a JAK inhibitor. 
• Initiating therapy with an investigational medication unless otherwise approved by the medical monitor.

6.1. Screening  
The screening period is the interval between signing the ICF and the day the subject is 
randomized in the study (Day 1).  The screening period  may not exceed 28 days.  Informed 
consent must be obtained before performing any study- specific procedures that are not 
considered standard of care.  Assessments that are required to demonstrate eligibility may be 
performed over the course of 1 or more days during this period. 
Procedures conducted as part of the subject' s routine clinical management ( eg, complete blood 
count) and obtained before  signing of informed consent may be used  for screening or baseline 
purposes, provided that the procedure meets the Protocol- defined criteria and has been 
performed in the timeframe of the study.  Results from the screening visit evaluations will be 
reviewed to confirm subject eligibility before randomization or the administration of study drug.  Tests with results that fail eligibility requirements may be repeated once during the screening 
period if the investigator believes the results to be in error or believes there has been a change in 
eligibility status (eg, following recovery from an infection) .  For screening a ssessments that are 
repeated, the most recent available result before  randomization will be used to determine subject 
eligibility.  Treatment should start as soon as possible but within 2 days after the date of randomization. 
CONFIDENTIAL  
Incyte Corporation  Page 44 of 92 
Protocol INCB 39110- 301 Am 4 Version 4 13 AUG 2018  
6.2. Treatment  
The treatment period begins on the day the subject receives the first dose of study drug through 
the point at which the principal investigator determines the subject will be permanently 
discontinued from study drug.  Dates for subsequent study visits will be determined based upon 
this day and should occur within ± 3 days of the scheduled date unless delayed for safety 
reasons.  During the Day 1  visit, results from screening visit evaluations should be reviewed to 
determine whether  the subject continues to meet the eligibility requirements as specified in the 
Protocol. 
6.3. End of Treatment  
If a decision is made that the subject will permanently discontinue study treatment, the EOT visit 
should be conducted.  If the EOT visit coincides with a regular study visit, the EOT evaluations 
will supersede those of that scheduled visit, and the data should be entered in the EOT visit in the 
eCRF.  The subject should be encouraged to return for the follow-up visit. 
6.4. Re-Treatment 
For subjects  who experience aGVHD recurrence after taper of randomi zed treatment is 
completed, investigators have the option to use open- label itacitinib plus corticosteroids for the 
treatment of recurrent aGVHD irrespective of initial randomized treatment.  For the purpose of this Protocol , treatment of recurrent aGVHD w ith open- label itacitinib plus corticosteroids will 
be called  the re-treatment phase.  Subjects entering the re- treatment phase will be required to 
follow the assessment schedule as outlined in Table 3.  Corticosteroid tapering will be performed 
at the investigator 's discretion.  Investigators wishing to initiate a taper of itacitinib earlier than 
Day 180 may do so upon consultation with and approval from the sponsor's medical monitor.  
Subjects may be re- treated wit h itacitinib only once.  Subjects  ending the re-treatment phase will 
repeat the EOT visit and subsequent safety and survival follow-up visits. 
6.5. Follow -Up 
6.5.1. Safety Follow- Up 
The safety follow -up period is the interval between the EOT visit and the scheduled follow -up 
visit, which should occur 30 to 35 days after the EOT visit (or after the last dose of study drug if the EOT visit was not performed).  Adverse events and SAEs must be reported up until at least 30 days after the last dose of study drug, the date o f the follow- up visit, or until toxicities 
resolve, return to baseline, or are deemed irreversible, whichever is longer. 
If a subject withdrew from treatment due to reasons other than disease progression, GVHD 
staging and grading will be repeated at the safety follow -up visit. 
CONFIDENTIAL  
Incyte Corporation  Page 45 of 92 
Protocol INCB 39110- 301 Am 4 Version 4 13 AUG 2018  
6.5.2. Post-Treatment GVHD Follow- Up 
Subjects who completed study treatment or discontinued treatment for reasons other than GVHD 
progression will be followed every 28 days ( ± 7 days) after the safety follow -up visit until any of 
the followi ng occurs: 
• GVHD progression . 
• Initiation of a new anti- GVHD therapy . 
• Relapse/recurrence of underlying hematologic disease. 
• A maximum of 12 months from EOT  or a maximum of 24 months from Day 1 is 
reached, whichever occurs first.  
6.5.3. Survival Follow- Up 
Subjects  who complete post- treatment follow -up or  experience GVHD progression or require a 
new anti -GVHD therapy should be contacted by telephone, email, or visit at least every 8 weeks 
(± 7 days) to assess for new GVHD therapy and survival status until death, withdrawal of 
consent, or the end of the study, whichever occurs first. 
6.6. Unscheduled Visits 
Unscheduled visits may be held at any time at the investigator 's discretion, and appropriate 
clinical and laboratory measurements performed based on AEs or other findings.

7. CONDUCT OF STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES  
7.1. Administration of Informed Consent Form  
Valid informed consent must be obtained from the study subject before conducting any 
study-specific procedures using an ICF approved by the local IRB/IEC that contains al l elements 
required by ICH E6 and describes the nature, scope, and possible consequences of the study in a 
form understandable to the study subject.  Local and institutional guidelines for ICF content and 
administration must be followed; the original signe d ICF must be retained by the investigator, 
and a copy of the signed ICF must be provided to the study subject.  The informed consent 
process for each subject must be documented in writing within the subject source documentation.  
Subjects of childbearing potential must agree to take appropriate measures to avoid pregnancy in order to participate in the study ( see Appendix A ). 
7.2. Interactive Response Technology Procedure  
The IVRS will be contacted to obtain a subject ID number when a subject enters the screening 
period.  Upon determining that the subject is eligible for study entry, the IVRS will be contacted to obtain study drug assignment.  Additionally, the IVRS will be contacted every 28 days to 
update study drug supply.  See Section  5.1.1 for additional information.  
7.3. Demography and Medical History  
7.3.1. Demographics and General Medical History  
Demographic data and a complete medical and medication history will be collected at screening.  
7.3.2. Disease Characteristics and Treatment History  
A disease- targeted medical and medication history including hematologic malignancy type, 
current GVHD staging, date of diagnosis, sites of disease, prior anticancer  therapy, ablation 
therapy, prophyl axis therapy, donor type, and other details related to the disease under study will 
be collected at screening.  
7.4. Prior and Concomitant Medications  
Prior and concomitant medications will be reviewed to determine subject eligibility.  All concomitant medications and measures must be recorded in the eCRF, and any medication 
received  or procedure performed within 30 days before randomization and up to the safety 
follow-up visit will be recorded in the eCRF.  The medication record will be maintained after 
signing  the ICF to document concomitant medications, including any changes to the dose or 
regimen.  Concomitant medications include any prescription, over- the-counter, or natural/herbal 
preparations taken or administered during the study period.  Concomitant treatments and/or procedures that are required to manage a subject 's medical condition during the study will also be 
recorded in the eCRF.

Protocol INCB 39110- 301 Am 4 Version 4 13 AUG 2018  
7.5. Safety Assessments  
7.5.1. Adverse Events  
Adverse events will be monitored from the time the subject signs the ICF.  Subjects will be 
instructed to report all AEs during the study and will be assessed for the occurrence of AEs 
throughout the study.  In order to avoid bias in eliciting AEs, subjects will be asked general, 
nonleading questions such as " How are you feeling? "  All AEs ( serious and nonserious) must be 
recorded on the source documents and eCRFs regardless of the assumption of a causal 
relationship with the study drug.  The definition, reporting, and recording requirements for AEs 
are described in Section  8. 
7.5.2. Physical Examination 
The targeted physical examination will be a symptom -directed evaluation conducted by the 
investigator or a medically qualified designee.  The targeted physical examination will include height (screening only) and assessment(s) of the body systems or organs, as indicated by subject symptoms, AEs, or other findings.  Clinically notable  abnormalities that are considered clinically 
significant in the judgment of the investigator are to be reported as AE s. 
7.5.3. Vital Signs  
Vital sign measurements include blood pressure, pulse, respiratory rate, body temperature, and body weight.  Blood pressure and pulse will be taken with the subject in the recumbent, 
semirecumbent , or sitting position.  Clinically notable  abnormalities that are considered 
clinically significant in the judgment of the investigator are to be reported as AEs. 
7.5.4. ECOG Performance Status  
ECOG performance status ( Oken  et al 1982; Table  6) will be assessed  at screening and  other 
study visits per Table 3.  Performance status must be assessed by a medically qualified  individual 
and recorded in the e CRF . 
Table 6: ECOG Performance Status Grades  
Grade  Performance Status  
0 Fully active, able to carry on all predisease performance without restriction. 
1 Restricted in physically strenuous activity but ambulatory and able to carry out work of a

Protocol INCB 39110- 301 Am 4 Version 4 13 AUG 2018  
7.5.5. Twelve- Lead Electrocardiograms  
A 12 -lead ECG  will be performed during screening with the subject in a recumbent or 
semirecumbent  position after 5 minutes of rest.  
The 12- lead ECG  will be interpreted by the investigator at the site and will be used for 
immediate subject management.  The decision to include or exclude a subject or withdraw a 
subject from the study based on an ECG flagged as "Abnor mal, Clinically Significant " is the 
responsibility of the investigator, in consultation with the sponsor' s medical monitor, as 
appropriate.  
Electrocardiograms that are identified as abnormal and clinically meaningful compared with the 
screening assessment  should be reported as AEs.  For such AEs, the findings of the abnormal 
ECGs and the corresponding baseline ECG findings must be reported in the eCRF.  
An additional ECG will be performed at the EOT visit; a dditional ECGs may be performed at the 
investigator' s discretion as clinically indicated.  
7.5.6. Laboratory Assessments 
Blood draws for laboratory assessments will occur at study visits indicated in Table 4.  Blood 
draws will be completed before the subject receives the morning dose of study drug .  Specific 
laboratory assessments are listed in Table 5.   
All laboratory assessments will be performed at a local (site) laboratory using institutional best 
practices.  Results and normal  reference ranges will be entered into the e CRF.  
7.5.6.1. Chemistry  
All chemistry panel assessments will be performed at a local (site) laboratory from blood 
samples collected using institutional best practices before  administration of study drug.  Results 
and nor mal reference ranges will be entered into the e CRF.  
7.5.6.2. Hematology 
Hematology assessments, including complete blood count with differential, will be performed at a local (site) laboratory using institutional best practices before  administration of study drug.  
Results and normal reference ranges will be entered into the e CRF.  
7.5.6.3. Pregnancy Testing  
A serum pregnancy test will be required for all women of childbearing potential during screening and at the EOT  visit.  Urine pregnancy tests will be conducted every 28 days .  Urine pregnancy 
tests will be performed  locally.  If a urine pregnancy test is positive, the results should be 
confirmed with a serum pregnancy test. 
If the serum pregnancy test is negative after a urine test was positive, the investigator will asse ss 
the potential benefit/risk to the subject and determine whether it is in the subject' s best interest to 
resume study drug and continue participation in the study. 
CONFIDENTIAL  
Incyte Corporation  Page 49 of 92 
Protocol INCB 39110- 301 Am 4 Version 4 13 AUG 2018  
7.5.6.4. Hepatitis Screening  
Subjects with active HBV or HCV infection that requires treatment or w ho are at risk for HBV 
reactivation are excluded from the study.  At risk for HBV reactivation is defined as hepatitis B 
surface antigen positive or anti–hepatitis B core antibody positive.   Prior test results obtained as 
part of standard of care before al lo-HSCT confirming that a subject is immune and not at risk for 
reactivation (ie, hepatitis B surface antigen negative, surface antibody positive) may be used for 
purposes of eligibility, and tests do not need to be repeated.  Subjects with prior positive serology 
results must have negative polymerase chain reaction results.  Subjects whose immune status is 
unknown or uncertain must have results confirming immune status before enrollment. 
7.5.6.5. HIV  Screening  
Subjects with an active HIV infection are excluded from  the study.  Prior HIV screening results 
obtained as standard of care for allo -HSCT confirming the subject is HIV -negative may be used 
for determining eligibility, and tests do not need to be repeated.  Subjects whose HIV status is 
unknown must have results confirming negative status before enrollment.  
7.6. Efficacy Assessments 
7.6.1. GVHD Staging and Grading  
Acute GVHD gradin g will be performed by the investigator on a weekly  basis for the firs t 
8 weeks after randomization, the n every 28 days thereafter.  GVHD stagin g and grading will also 
occur on Day s 100, 180, and 365 and at the EOT visit. 
On-treatment aGVHD grading should be p erformed relative to the Day 1 assessment.  
If subjects withdrew due to reasons other than GVHD progression, then GVHD staging and grading wi ll be assessed at the safety follow -up visit and every 28 days thereafter during survival 
follow-up until progression of GVHD, start of new anti- GVHD therapy, or death .  
Data regarding the quantification of aGVHD symptoms (extent of skin rash, total biliru bin level, 
volume of diarrhea) should be reported using MAGIC guidelines ( Harris  et al 2016); response 
will be assessed as per CIBMTR modifications to the IBMTR response index as indicated in 
Appendix B  (CIBMTR  2009).  
• Skin: 
− Only areas involved with active erythema should be used for determination of 
body surface area staging  based on the rule of nines. 
− A portion of a body area segment may be used for the quantification. 
− Desquamation or fluid-filled bullae should be reported if present, as these findings are the hallmark of Stage 4 skin GVHD.  
• Liver:  
− Liver GVHD staging is based solely on total (not conjugated/direct) serum bilirubin levels.  
CONFIDENTIAL  
Incyte Corporation  Page 50 of 92 
Protocol INCB 39110- 301 Am 4 Version 4 13 AUG 2018  
− Liver G VHD manifesting as transaminitis without concomitant elevation in serum 
bilirubin should be diagnosed when the presence of GVHD is confirmed by liver 
biopsy (where appropriate) and score it as Stage 0.  
− If bilirubin levels were elevated before the diagnosis of GVHD in another target 
organ and do not increase further, liver GVHD should not be diagnosed in the absence of biopsy confirmation.  However, if hyperbilirubinemia develops at the 
same time or after the onset of GVHD in another target organ, liver GVH D is 
presumed to be present in the absence of an identified alternative cause.  
• Upper GI: 
− Symptoms of concern for upper GI GVHD include anorexia, nausea, vomiting, 
and dyspepsia, and assessment depends on close attention to calori c intake and 
symptom report ing. 
− An upper GI endoscopy should be performed whenever possible to confirm upper GI GVHD; however, the diagnosis may be made without biopsy confirmation. 
− GVHD is typically not considered as a possible etiology when nausea lasts fewer than 3 days, or with fewer than 2 vomiting episodes per day for at least 2 days, or 
anorexia without weight loss. 
• Lower GI:  
− Staging of lower GI GVHD relies on accurate measurement of daily stool 
volumes and documentation of the presence of hematochezia or severe abdominal pain. 
− In cases where stool volume cannot be closely measured, volume should be calculated based on average of 200 mL per episode multiplied by the number of 
episodes in a 24-hour period. 
− At the time of GVHD onset, staging should be based on the highest daily volume 
during the 3 days before diagnosis (excluding volumes attributable to procedures such as bowel preps or endoscopy). 
− After the initiation of treatment, lower GVHD staging should be based on the diarrhea volume using the following measurements  (in the order of preference):  
1) average of 3 consecutive days, 2) average of 2 consecutive days, or 3) the 
volume on day of assessment. 
− Severe abdominal pain, ileus, and/or grossly bloody stool should be documented 
when present because Stage 4 lower GI GVHD is s taged based on the presence of 
these symptoms and is independent of volume of diarrhea. 
7.6.2. Chronic GVHD Assessment  
Subjects will be assessed for signs and symptoms of cGVHD according to local institutional practice at screening, during the treatment phase, at the end of treatment, and during re- treatment 
(if applicable) as indicated in  Table 3.  Definitive and possible manifestations of cGVHD should 
be assessed as per NIH consensus guidelines for cGVHD ( Jagasia  et al 2015). 
CONFIDENTIAL  
Incyte Corporation  Page 54 of 92 
Protocol INCB 39110- 301 Am 4 Version 4 13 AUG 2018  
The severity of AEs will be assessed using CTCAE v4.03 Grades 1 through 5.  If an event is not 
classified by CTCAE, the severity of the AE will be graded according to t he scale below to 
estimate the grade of severity.  
Grade  1 Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; 
intervention not indicated.  
Grade 2  Moderate; minimal, local, or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age-appr opriate activities of daily living.  
Grade 3  Severe or medical ly significant but not immediately life -threatening; hospitalization 
or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self -care activities of 
daily living.  
Grade 4  Life-threate ning consequences; urgent intervention indicated. 
Grade 5  Death due to AE  
The occurrence of AEs should be sought by nondirective questioning of the subject during the 
screening process after signing the ICF and at each visit during the study.  Adverse ev ents may 
also be detected when they are volunteered by the subject during the screening process or 
between visits, or through physical examination, laboratory test, or other assessments.  To the 
extent possible, each AE should be evaluated to determine: 
• The severity grade (CTCAE Grade 1 to  5). 
• Whether there is at least a reasonable possibility that the AE is related to the study 
treatment:  suspected  (yes) or not suspected (no).  
• The start and end dates, unless unresolved at final follow-up. 
• The action taken  with regard to study drug. 
• The event outcome ( eg, not recovered/not resolved, recovered/resolved, 
recovering/resolving, recovered/resolved with sequelae, fatal, unknown). 
• The seriousness, as per serious adverse event (SAE) definition provided in Section  8.3.1. 
Unlike routine safety assessments, SAEs are monitored continuously and have special reporting 
requirements (see Section  8.3.2).  
All AEs should be treated appropri ately.  If an AE is treated with a concomitant medication or 
nondrug therapy, this action should be recorded on Adverse Event form and the treatment should be specified on the Prior/Concomitant Medications or Procedures and Non- Drug Therapy form 
in the eCR F. 
Once an AE is detected, it should be followed until it has resolved or until it is judged to be permanent; assessment should be made at each visit (or more frequently if necessary) of any 
changes in severity, the suspected relationship to the study drug, the interventions required to 
treat the event, and the outcome.  
When the severity of an AE changes over time for a reporting period (eg, between visits), each 
change in severity will be reported as a separate AE until the event resolves.  For example, 
2 separate AEs will be reported if a subject has Grade 1 diarrhea, meeting the definition of an 
CONFIDENTIAL  
Incyte Corporation  Page 55 of 92 
Protocol INCB 39110- 301 Am 4 Version 4 13 AUG 2018  
AE, that lasts for 3 days before worsening to a Grade 3 severity.  The Grade 1 event will be 
reported as an AE with a start date equal to the day the event met th e Grade 1 AE definition and 
a stop date equal to the day that the event increased in severity from Grade 1 to Grade 3.  The 
Grade 3 event will also be reported as an AE, with the start date equal to the day the event changed in intensity from Grade 1 to Grade 3 and a stop date equal to the day that the event 
either changed severity again or resolved.  For analysis purposes, this will be considered 1 AE 
for this subject, and the highest reported severity will be used. 
8.2. Laboratory Test Abnormalities  
Laboratory  abnormalities that constitute an AE in their own right (considered clinically 
meaningful, induce clinical signs or symptoms, require concomitant therapy, or require changes in study drug) should be recorded on the Adverse Event form in the eCRF.  Whenever possible, a diagnosis rather than a symptom should be provided (eg, " anemia" instead of "low hemoglobin" ).  
Laboratory abnormalities that meet the criteria for AEs should be followed until they have returned to normal or an adequate explanation of the abnormality is found.  When an abnormal laboratory test result corresponds to a sign or symptom of a previously reported AE, it is not 
necessary to separately record the laboratory test result as an additional event.  
Laboratory abnormalities that do not meet the definition of an AE should not be reported as AEs.  
A Grade  3 or 4 AE does not automatically indicate an SAE unless it meets the definition of 
serious, as defined in Section  8.3.1, and/or per the investigator's discretion.  A dose modification 
for the laboratory abnormality may be required (see  Section  5.4.2) and should not contribute to 
the designation of a laboratory test abnormality as an SAE. 
8.3. Serious Adverse Even ts 
8.3.1. Definitions  
An SAE is defined as an event that meets at least 1 of the following criteria: 
• Is fatal or life -threatening.  
• Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, unless 
hospitalization is a result of: 
− A routine treatment or monitoring of the studied indication not associated with 
any deterioration in condition. 
− An elective or preplanned treatment for a pre -existing condition that is unrelated 
to the indication under study and has not worsened since signing the ICF. 
− A treatment on an emergency outpatient basis for an event not fulfilling any of the definitions of a SAE and not resulting in hospital admission. 
− Any social reasons and respite care, in the absence of any deterioration in the subject 's general condition. 
• Results in persistent or significant disability, incapacity, or a substantial disruption of 
a person 's ability to conduct normal life functions. 
• Constitutes a congenital anomaly or birth defect. 
CONFIDENTIAL  
Incyte Corporation  Page 56 of 92 
Protocol INCB 39110- 301 Am 4 Version 4 13 AUG 2018  
• Is considered to be an important medical event or a medically significant event that 
may not result in death, be immediately life -threatening, or require hospitalization but 
may be considered serious when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, the event 
may jeopardize the subject or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 
1 of the outcomes listed above. 
8.3.2. Reporting  
To ensure subject safety, every SAE, regardless of suspected causality (including events that may not be associated with the study drug[s] but may be associated with a study procedure or 
disease progression) , unless otherwise specified by the Protocol, occurring after the subject has 
signed the ICF and up to the last study visit, or up to 30 days after the subject has stopped study 
treatment, whichever is later, must be reported to the sponsor (or designee) within 24 hours  of 
learning of its occurrence.  Any SAEs occurring more than 30 days after the last dose of study 
drug should be reported to the sponsor, or its designee, only if the investigator suspects a causal 
relationship to the study drug.  An SAE occurring at a different time interval or otherwise 
considered completely unrelated to a previously reported SAE should be reported separately as a new event.  Previously planned (ie, before providing informed consent) surgeries should not be 
reported as SAEs unless the underlying medical condition worsens over the course of the study. 
Information about all SAEs is collected and recorded on the Adverse Event form of the eCRF.  
The investigator must assess and record the causal  relationship of each SAE to each specific 
study drug ( itacitinib /placebo  and the cortico steroid during the time it is given).  
The investigator must also complete the Incyte Serious Adverse Event Report Form, in English, and send the completed and signed form to the sponsor or designee within 24 hours of becoming 
aware of the SAE.  The investigator must provide a causality assessment, that is, assess whether 
there is at least a reasonable possibility that the SAE is related to the study treatment:  suspected (yes) or not suspected (no).  Refer to the Incyte Reference Guide for Completing the Serious 
Adverse Event Report Form. 
The contact information of the sponsor' s study -specific representatives is listed in the 
investigator manual provided to each site.  The original copy of the SAE Report Form and the 
confirmation sheet must be kept at the study site.  
Investigational site personnel must report any new information regarding the SAE within 
24 hours of becoming aware of the information in the same manner that the initial SA E Report 
Form was sent.  Follow-up information is recorded on an amended or new SAE Report Form, with an indication that it is follow -up to the previously reported SAE and the date of the original 
report.  The follow-up report should include information that was not provided on the previous 
SAE Report Form, such as the outcome of the event (eg, resolved or ongoing), treatment 
provided, action taken with study drug because of the SAE (eg, dose reduced, interrupted, or discontinued), or subject disposition (eg, continued or withdrew from study participation).  Each 
recurrence, complication, or progression of the original event should be reported as follow-up to 
that event, regardless of when it occurs. 
If the SAE is not documented in the IB for itacitinib  (new  occurrence) and is thought to be 
related to the sponsor's study drug, the sponsor or its designee may urgently require further 
information from the investigator for reporting to health authorities.  The sponsor or its designee 
CONFIDENTIAL  
Incyte Corporation  Page 57 of 92 
Protocol INCB 39110- 301 Am 4 Version 4 13 AUG 2018  
may need to issue an Investi gator Notification (IN) to inform all investigators involved in any 
study with the same drug that this SAE has been reported.  Suspected Unexpected Serious 
Adverse Reactions (SUSARs) will be collected and reported to the competent authorities and 
relevant ethics committees in accordance with Directive 2001/20/EC, or as per national 
regulatory requirements in participating countries. 
8.4. Emergency Unblinding of Treatment Assignment  
The procedure for emergency unblinding is provided in the study reference manual.   This option 
may be used ONLY if the subject 's well -being requires the investigator to be aware of the 
subject 's treatment assignment.  
The investigator should make every effort to contact the sponsor's medical monitor before unblinding a subject' s treatme nt assignment; however, this is not mandatory.  If a subject' s 
treatment assignment is unblinded, the sponsor or its designee must be notified immediately by 
telephone. 
If an investigator, site personnel performing assessments, or subject is unblinded, the subject 
must be withdrawn from the study treatment.  In cases where there are ethical reasons to have the 
subject remain in the study, the investigator must obtain specific approval from the sponsor' s (or 
its designee 's) clinical research physician or med ical monitor for the subject to continue in the 
study.  
8.5. Pregnancy  
Pregnancy, in and of itself, is not regarded as an AE unless there is suspicion that study drug may have interfered with the effectiveness of a contraceptive medication or method.  When a 
pregnancy has been confirmed in a subject during maternal or paternal exposure to study drug, 
the following procedures should be followed in order to ensure subject safety: 
• The study drug must be discontinued immediately (female subjects only; see 
Section  5.4 for the maximum permitted duration of study drug interruption). 
• The investigator must complete and submit the Incyte Clinical Trial Pregnancy form to the sponsor or its designee within 24 hours  of learning of th e pregnancy.  
Data on fetal outcome and breastfeeding are collected for regulatory reporting and drug safety 
evaluation.  Follow-up should be conducted for each pregnancy to determine outcome, including 
spontaneous or voluntary termination, details of the birth, and the presence or absence of any 
birth defects, congenital abnormalities, or maternal and/or newborn complications, by following until the first well-baby visit.  Pregnancy should be recorded on a Clinical Trial Pregnancy form 
and reported by the investigator to the sponsor or its designee.  Pregnancy follow-up information 
should be recorded on the same form and should include an assessment of the possible causal relationship to the sponsor's study drug to any pregnancy outcome, as well as follow-up to the 
first well-baby visit or the duration specified in local regulations, whichever is later.  Refer to the 
Incyte Reference Guide for Completing the Clinical Trial Pregnancy Form.  
Any SAE occurring during pregnancy must be recorded on the SAE report f orm and 
submitted to the sponsor or designee.

Protocol INCB 39110- 301 Am 4 Version 4 13 AUG 2018  
8.6. Warnings and Precautions  
Special warnings or precautions for the study drug, derived from safety information collected by 
the sponsor or its designee, are presented in the IB.  Additional safety information collected 
between IB updates will be communicated in the form of Investigator Notifications (INs).  Any important new safety information should be discussed with the subject during the study, as necessary.  If new sign ificant risks are identified, they will be added to the ICF. 
8.7. Data Monitoring Committee  
An external  DMC will be formed to monitor the study.  The DMC will consist of external 
investigators who will function autonomously from all other individuals associated with the 
conduct of the trial, including investigators and sponsor personnel.  The DMC will be responsible for reviewing results from the prespecified  interim analysis  and recommending  an 
appropriate course of action based on these data.   Details on the c omposition and responsibilities 
of the DMC can be found in the DMC charter. 
8.8. Product Complaints  
The sponsor collects product complaints on study drugs and drug delivery systems used in 
clinical studies in order to ensure the safety of study participants, monitor quality, and facilitate 
process and product improvements. 
All product complaints associated with material packaged, labeled, and released by the sponsor 
or its designee will be reported to the sponsor.  All product complaints associated with other 
study material will be reported directly to the respective manufacturer.  
The investigator or his/her designee is responsible for reporting a complete description of the 
product complaint via email or other written communication to the sponsor contact or respective 
manufacturer as noted in the packaging information.  Any AE associated with a product complaint should be reported as described in Section  8.1.2 of this Protocol. 
If the investigator is asked to return the product for investigation, he/she will return a copy of the product complaint communication with the product.

9. STATISTICS  
9.1. Study Populations  
Subject enrollment, disposition, demographics, and medical history will be summarized at 
baselin e.  Dose exposure wi ll be calculated for each dose level.  Safety and disease response data 
will be compared over time to assess change from baseline, during treatment, and follow-up. 
The populations to be analyzed include the following: 
• Efficacy e valuable population:  Subjects randomized into the study. 
• Per-Protocol population:  A subset of subjects in the e fficacy evaluable population  
who are compliant with requirements of the clinical study Protocol, including: 
− Continued to meet all eligibility criteria on Study Day 1.  
− Initiated correct randomized therapy within the Protocol-specified window. 
− Did not significantly deviate from the Protocol in terms of missed study visits, 
noncompliance with randomized therapy, or prohibited concomitant medications. 
• Safety evaluable population:  Subjects randomized into the study who received at 
least 1  dose of study drug. 
• Pharmacokinetic and t ranslational research evaluable population:  Subjects who 
receive at least 1 dose of study drug and provide at least 1 plasma sample 
(1 corresponding PK or translational research measurement) after study drug 
administration will be considered as potential PK  evaluable subjects .  The study 
pharmacokineticist will review data listings of study drug administration and sample records to identify subjects to be excluded from analyses of PK  data.  
9.2. Selection of Sample Size  
A sample size  of 414 subjects with 1:1 randomization ( itacitinib vs placebo ) and stratification 
based on aGV HD risk status (standard risk vs high risk ) provides approximately 90% power to 
test f or the primary endpoint (ORR at Day 28) and 83% power to test for the key secondary 
endpoint (NRM at Month 6).   The family -wise α- level will be controlled at 0.025 overall for the 
two comparisons.  Specifically, this study will claim to have achieved the efficacy  objective 
when the primary endpoint ORR at Day 28 shows a significant treatment effect at 1-sided α =  0.025.  Conditional on significance of the primary endpoint, the key secondary endpoint ( NRM 
at Month 6) will be tested at 1-sided α = 0.025.  
An absolute improvement of 16% in  the primary endpoint of ORR at Day 28 would be 
considered a clinically meaningful improvemen t over standard first -line systemic treatment for 
aGVHD (standard care ORR at Day 28:  P
0 = 0.56; itacitinib ORR at Day 28:  P 1 = 0.72) .  A 
sample size of 414 subjects (207 subjects per treatment arm)  will provide approximately 90% 
power to detect a 16% ov erall difference (72% vs 56 %) between treatment cohorts for the 
primary endpoint ( ORR at Day 28 ) at a 1 -sided alpha level of 0.025.  A CMH test with 2 -strata 
will be  used. 
CONFIDENTIAL  
Incyte Corporation  Page 60 of 92 
Protocol INCB 39110- 301 Am 4 Version 4 13 AUG 2018  
The assumed Day 28 ORR of 56% is based on MacMillan  et al  (2015).  The s tratum- specific 
response rates ( standard risk , 68% ; high risk , 44%) assume  a standard risk :high risk ratio of 
0.50:0.50.  It is expected that treatment  with itacitinib  will result in a 16% increase in the ORR, 
that is , an expected odds ratio of 2.02 (which corresp onds to an overall increase in ORR to 72%), 
with stratum- specific response rates of 81% and 61% for standard-risk and high-r isk aGVHD 
cohorts , respectively .  Power for the  CMH test with  stratification based on  GVHD risk s core was 
calculated using software N-Query 5.0. 
Given its clinical significance, NRM at Month 6 will be assessed as the key secondary endpoint.  
Based on MacMillan  et al  (2015), the overall NRM  at Month 6 in the BAT arm is 33%, with a 
stratum- specific NRM  of 22% for standard risk and 44% for high risk ( assum ing a s tandard 
risk:high risk ratio of 0.50:0.50).  A 40% relati ve reduction in NRM rate will be considered a 
clinical ly meaningful improvement.  A sample size of 414 subjects (207 subjects per treatment 
cohort) will provide 83% powe r to detect a  relative reduction of 40% (or absolute difference of 
13.2%, ie, 19.8% vs 33% at Day 180) between treatment cohort s at a 1 -sided α level of 0.025 
with an odds ratio of 0.50.  A CMH test with 2 -strata w ill be  used.  Stratum- specific NRM  rates  
of 12.4% and 28.2% are expected for standard- risk and high -risk cohorts, respectively.  Power 
for the CMH test with  stratification based on GVH D risk score was calculated using software 
N-Query 5.0. In order to compensate for an anticipated early withdrawal rate of up to 5% (ie, subjects who do 
not have any  response data before Day 28), a total of 436 subjects (218 per treatment arm) will 
be rand omized into the study to ensure a sample size of 414 evaluable subjects. 
If the Day 180 NRM rate difference between 2 groups is tested using a Kaplan –Meier estimator 
of the cumulative distribution function at Day 180, with  the rates being 19.8% and 33%, 
respectively, simulations (with sample size of 436 subjects) have shown that the power of 
detecting treatment difference is 0.811.  
9.2.1. Interim Analysis 1  
The first interim analysis for futility only will be performed when 112 subjects (25.7% of the 
planned 436 subjects) have completed the Day 28 visit or withdrew early from the study.  No 
alpha will be spent during the first interim analysis.  The stopping rule is nonbinding.  When the 
conditional power is <20%, the sponsor may consider terminating the study if the totality of 
evidence is warranted .  The conditional power is calculated assuming that the estimated 
treatment effect at the interim analysis is the true effect using the following formula  
(Jennison and Turnbull 2000): 
 
where Φ is the cumulative distribution function of the observed normalized test statistic z, and t is the information fraction (ie, observed sample at interim divided by total sample, which is the 
planned total sample size 436); t = 0.257 at interim 1 and 
 1.96.

Incyte Corporation  Page 61 of 92 
Protocol INCB 39110- 301 Am 4 Version 4 13 AUG 2018  
9.2.2. Interim Analysis 2  
The second interim analysis for both futility and efficacy will be performed when 240 subjects 
(55% of the targeted 436 subjects) have completed the Day 180 visit or withdrew early from the 
study.  
The Hwang -Shih- DeCan i alpha spending function with shape parameter -4 ( O’Bri en-Fleming 
like boundary ) will be used to define the upper efficacy boundar y  for the primary analysis of 
ORR at Day 28 when approximately 240 subjects reach Day 180 ( Hwang et  al 1990).  Based on 
enrollment projection, there will be approximately 360 subjects who have completed Day 28 . 
Table 8 lists the efficacy boundar y when information fraction (ie, t he percentage of subjects) is 
0.826 (360 subjects  complete Day 28) at interim 2 ; if ORR tested at Day 28 crosses the 
boundary, the key secondary endpoint, 6-month NRM, will be tested by passing the allocated 
alpha in this interim analysis to NRM .  By simulation, without considering early s topping for 
futility, the power of testing 6 -month NRM at Interim 2 (with 240 subjects complete Day 180) is 
about 0.608. 
As in interim 1, conditional power based on test statistic of ORR at Day 28 will be recalculated 
using its observed information fraction and observed normalized test statistic at interim 2.  The 
sponsor will consider stopping the study for futility if the conditional power is less than 20%.  If 
neither the efficacy nor the futility boundary for testing ORR at Day 28 is crossed, the study will 
continue.

The interim analyses will be performed by an independent statistician and programmer not 
involved with the conduct of the study a s described in the DMC charter.  
9.2.3. Final Analysis of the Primary Analysis 
Final analysis will be conducted when approximately 436 subjects have completed Day 180 or withdrew from the study.  If the observed normaliz ed test statistic crosses the efficacy boundary, 
then superiority of itacitinib plus corticosteroids over placebo plus corticosteroids will be 
claimed.  Again, ORR at Day 28 will be tested  first, and if positive, NRM mortality at Day  180 
will be tested.  
Note that if there is substantial over -running at the end of the study (ie, total number of subjects  
is greater than 446), the method to adjust the final critical value will be provided in order to 
control overall Type I error rate.  In such a scenario, deta ils in implementation the rules will be 
specified in  the Statistical Analysis Plan.

9.3. Level of Significance  
The 1-sided significance level for the primary and key second ary endpoint analysis is 0.025.  The 
2-sided significance level for other analyses is 0.05.  All C Is will be 9 5%. 
9.4. Statistical Analyses  
9.4.1. Primary Analyses 
The primary endpoint is ORR at Day 28, defined as the proportion of subjects demonstrating a 
CR, VGPR, or PR, as per standard  criteria  (Harris  et al 2016, CIBMTR  2009).  The  comparison 
of ORR at Day 28 between treatment cohorts will be conducted once the last subject completes 
the Day 28 visit or withdraws from the study.  A CMH test with normal approximation will be 
used.  Summary statistics and 95% CI will be provided.  
Subjects who are missing Day 28 a GVHD response assessment data will be considered to be 
nonresponders. 
 
 
9.4.2. Secondary Analyses 
The key secondary endpoint is NRM at Month 6, defined as the proportion of subjects who died 
due to causes other than malignancy relapse at Month 6.  The comparison of NRM at Month 6 
between treatment cohort s will be conducted using a 2-sample proportion test with normal 
approximation.  Summary statistics and 95% CI will be provided. 
Additional secondary endpoints will be analyzed as follows:  
• ORR, defined as the proportion of subjects demonstrating a CR, VGPR, or PR at 
Days 14, 56, and 100.  The comparison be tween treatment cohorts will be conducted 
using a 2-sample proportion test with normal approximation.  Summary statistics and applicable 95% CI will be provided. 
• NRM, defined as the proportion of subjects who died due to causes other than malignancy relaps e at Months 9, 12, and 24.  The comparison between treatment 
cohort s will be conducted using a 2- sample proportion test with normal 
approximation.  Cumulative incidence rates will be provided.  Summary statistics and applicable 95% CI will be provided. 
• DOR , defined as the time from first response until GVHD progression or death.  The 
comparison between treatment cohort s will be conducted using the log- rank test.  The 
Kaplan -Meier method  will be used.  Summary statistics will be provided.  
• TTR , defined as the interval from treatment initiation to first response.  
• Relapse rate of malignant and nonmalignant hematologic diseases, defined as the proportion of subjects whose underlying disease relapses.  The comparison between treatment cohorts will be conducted usi ng a 2-sample proportion test with normal 
approximation.  The cumulative incidence rate and s ummary statistics will be 
provided.

10. ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS AND A DMINISTRATIVE 
PROCEDURES  
10.1. Investigator Responsibilities  
This study will be performed in accordance with ethical principles that originate in the 
Declaration of Helsinki and conducted in adherence to the study Protocol; GCPs as defined in 
Title  21 of the US CFR Parts 11, 50, 54, 56, and 312; ICH E6 GCP consolidated guidelines; and 
local regulatory requirements as applicable to the study locations.  
The investigator will be responsible for: 
• Permitting study -related monitoring, sponsor audits, IRB/IEC review, and regulatory 
inspections by providing direct access to source data and other relevant clinical study documents. 
− Monitoring:  Qualified representatives of the sponsor or its designee, study 
monitors, will monitor the study according to a  predetermined plan.  The 
investigator must allow the study monitors to review any study materials and 
subject records at each monitoring visit. 
− Auditing:  Qualified representatives of the sponsor or its designee may audit the clinical study site and study  data to evaluate compliance with the Protocol, 
applicable local clinical study regulations, and overall study conduct.  The investigator must allow the auditors to review original source records and study documentation for all subjects. 
− Regulatory inspection:  Regulatory authorities may conduct an inspection of the 
study and the site at any time during the development of an investigational 
product.  The investigator and staff are expected to cooperate with the inspectors 
and allow access to all source docu ments supporting the eCRFs and other 
study-related documents.  The investigator must immediately notify the sponsor 
when contacted by any regulatory authority for the purposes of conducting an 
inspection. 
• Obtaining informed consent and ensuring that the study subjects' questions have been answered and the subjects fully understand study procedures: 
− Informed consent must be obtained before any study- related procedures are 
conducted, unless otherwise specified by the Protocol. 
− Informed consent must be obtained using the IRB/IEC-approved version in a 
language that is native and understandable to the subject.  A template will be 
provided by the sponsor or its designee.  The sponsor or its designee must review 
and acknowledge the site -specific changes to the ICF template.  The ICF must 
include a statement that the sponsor or its designee and regulatory authorities have 
direct access to subject records.  
CONFIDENTIAL  
Incyte Corporation  Page 68 of 92 
Protocol INCB 39110- 301 Am 4 Version 4 13 AUG 2018  
• Obtaining approval from the IRB/IEC before the start of the study and for any 
changes to the clinical study Proto col, important Protocol deviations, routine updates, 
and safety information in accordance with institutional requirements and local law. 
− The investigator is responsible for ensuring that the safety reports provided by the 
sponsor are reviewed and processed  in accordance with regulatory requirements 
and with the policies and procedures established by the IRB/IEC. 
• Adhering to the Protocol as described in this document and agreeing that changes to the Protocol procedures, with the exception of medical emergencies, must be 
discussed and approved, first, by the sponsor or its designee and, second, by the IRB/IEC.  Each investigator is responsible for enrolling subjects who have met the 
specified eligibility criteria.  
• Retaining records in accordance with all local , national, and regulatory laws, but for a 
minimum period of at least 2  years after the last marketing application approval in an 
ICH region and until there are no pending or contemplated marketing applications in an ICH region, or if not approved, 2 years  after the termination of the test article for 
investigation to ensure the availability of study documentation should it become 
necessary for the sponsor or a regulatory authority to review. 
− The investigator must not destroy any records associated with the study without 
receiving approval from the sponsor.  The investigator must notify the sponsor or 
its designee in the event of accidental loss or destruction of any study records.  If 
the investigator leaves the institution where the study was conducted, the sponsor or its designee must be contacted to arrange alternative record storage options. 
− All eCRF data entered by the site (including audit trail), as well as computer 
hardware and software (for accessing the data), will be maintained or made 
available at the site in compliance with applicable record retention regulations.  The sponsor will retain the original eCRF data and audit trail.  
10.2. Accountability, Handling, and Disposal of Study Drug  
The investigator is responsible for drug accountability at the stud y site; however, some of the 
drug accountability duties may be assigned to an appropriate pharmacist or other designee.  Inventory and accountability records must be maintained and readily available for inspection by 
the study monitor and are open to inspe ction at any time by any applicable regulatory authorities.  
The investigator or designee must maintain records that document: 
• Delivery of study drug to the study site.  
• Inventory of study drug at the site. 
• Subject use of the study drug including pill or unit counts from each supply dispensed. 
• Return of study drug to the investigator or designee by subjects. 
The investigational product must be used only in accordance with the Protocol.  The investigator 
will also maintain records adequately documenting that the subjects were provided the specified 
CONFIDENTIAL  
Incyte Corporation  Page 69 of 92 
Protocol INCB 39110- 301 Am 4 Version 4 13 AUG 2018  
study drug.  These records should include dates, quantities, and any available batch or serial 
numbers or unique code numbers assigned to the investigational product and study subjects. 
Completed accountability reco rds will be archived by the site.  The investigator or designee will 
be expected to collect and retain all used, unused, and partially used containers of study drug 
until verified by the study monitor (unless otherwise agreed to by the sponsor).  At the 
conclusion of the study, the investigator or designee will oversee shipment of any remaining 
study drug back to the sponsor or its designee for destruction according to institutional standard 
operating procedures.  If local procedures mandate on- site destruc tion of investigational supply, 
the site should (where local procedures allow) maintain the investigational supply until the study monitor inspects the accountability records in order to evaluate compliance and accuracy of accountability by the investigative site.  At sites where the study drug is destroyed before 
monitor inspection, the monitors rely on documentation of destruction per the site SOP. 
10.3. Data Management  
Data management will be performed in a validated database via an Electronic Data Capture 
(EDC) system.  All data entry, verification, and validation will be performed in accordance with 
the current standard operating procedures of the Data Management Department at the sponsor or its designee.  The database will be authorized for lock once all def ined procedures are completed.  
The investigator will be provided with access to an EDC system so that an eCRF can be 
completed for each subject.  Entries made in the eCRF must be verifiable against source 
documents; if updates to the database are not possi ble, any discrepancies should be explained 
and documented.  The investigator will be responsible for reviewing all data and eCRF entries 
and will sign and date the designated forms in each subject's eCRF, verifying that the 
information is true and correct.  The investigator is responsible for the review and approval of all query responses. 
Protocol deviations will be identified and recorded in the Protocol Deviation form of the eCRF.  
The study monitor will reference the Monitoring Plan in order to ensure t hat each issue identified 
is appropriately documented, reported, and resolved in a timely manner in accordance with the 
plan's requirements.  
10.4. Data Privacy and Confidentiality of Study Records  
The investigator and the sponsor, or its designee, must adhere to applicable data privacy laws 
and regulations.  The investigator and the sponsor, or its designee, are responsible for ensuring that sensitive information is handled in accordance with local requirements (eg, HIPAA).  
Appropriate consent and authorizations  for use and disclosure and/or transfer (if applicable) of 
protected information must be obtained. 
Subject names will not be supplied to the sponsor or its designee, if applicable.  Only the subject 
number and subject' s initials (subject' s initials will on ly be recorded if allowable by local 
regulations) will be recorded in the eCRF, where permitted; if the subject 's name appears on any 
other document (eg, laboratory report), it must be obliterated on the copy of the document to be supplied to the sponsor or its designee.  Study findings stored on a computer will be stored in 
accordance with local data protection laws.  The subjects will be informed that representatives of the sponsor or its designee, IRB or IEC, or regulatory authorities may inspect their m edical 
CONFIDENTIAL  
Incyte Corporation  Page 70 of 92 
Protocol INCB 39110- 301 Am 4 Version 4 13 AUG 2018  
records to verify the information collected, and that all personal information made available for 
inspection will be handled in strictest confidence and in accordance with local data protection 
laws.  
10.5. Financial Disclosure  
Before study initiation, all clinical investigators participating in clinical studies subject to FDA 
Regulation Title 21 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 54 – Financial Disclosure by 
Clinical Investigators (ie, "covered studies ") are required to submit a completed Clinical 
Investigator Financial Disclosure form that sufficiently details any financial interests and 
arrangements that apply.  For the purpose of this regulation, " clinical investigator " is defined as 
any investigator or subinvestigator who is directly involved in the treatment or evaluation of 
research subjects, including the spouse and each dependent child of the clinical investigator or subinvestigator.  These requirements apply to both US and foreign clinical investigators 
conducting covered clinical studies. 
Any n ew clinical investigators added to the covered clinical study during its conduct must also 
submit a completed Investigator Financial Disclosure Form.  During a covered clinical study, 
any changes to the financial information previously reported by a clinic al investigator must be 
reported to the sponsor or its designee.  At the conclusion of the covered clinical study, the

APPENDIX A. INFORMATION REGARDING EFFECTIVENESS OF 
CONTRACEPTIVE METHODS  
For Subjects Participating in the Study:  
The following methods that can achieve a failure rate of less than 1% per year when used 
consistently and correctly are cons idered as highly effective birth control methods.  Such 
methods include: 
• Combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception associated 
with inhibition of ovulation1 
− oral 
− intravaginal  
− transde rmal 
• Progestogen -only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation1 
− oral 
− injectable  
− implantable2 
• Intrauterine device (IUD)2  
• Intrauterine hormone- releasing system (IUS)2 
• Bilateral tubal occlusion2  
• Vasectomised partner2,3 
• Sexual abstinence4 
Source:  CTFG  2014. 
For Subjects Participating in the Study  in Canada : 
In order to conform to  Health Canada guidance5, subjects participating in this clinical trial in 
Canada are to use 2 forms of contraception, including at least 1 form of highly effective and 
1 effective method of contraception .  Subjects who are using combined hormonal contraception 
or progestogen -only hormonal contraception will be required to include a barrier method as well.  
1 Hormonal contraception may be susceptible to interaction with the IMP, which may reduce the efficacy of the 
contraception method.  
2 Contraception methods that in the context of this guidance are considered to have low user dependency.  
3 Vasectomised partner is a highly effective birth control method provided that partner is the sole sexual partner of 
the WOCBP trial participa nt and that the vasectomised partner has received medical assessment of the surgical 
success.  
4 In the context of this guidance, sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as 
refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study treatments.  The 
reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject.

enrollment 
− Gut: 
o Tolerating food or enteral feeding 
o Predominantly formed stools 
o No overt gastrointestinal bleeding or abdominal cramping 
o No more than occasional nausea or vomiting  
• Partial response (PR) is defined as improvement in one or more organs involved with

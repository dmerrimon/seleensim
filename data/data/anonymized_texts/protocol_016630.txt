Non-opioid pramipexole suppresses immune NLRP3 reactivity for pain   
 Page 3 of 42 Version Date : August 8, 2019  1. Objectives  
1.1. The long-term goal  of this proposal is to identify non-opioid  drugs that harness 
endogenous anti -inflammatory mechanisms resulting in the suppression of 
proinflammatory cytokines such as IL -1 providing  a novel approach to treat 
chronic pain in people while lacking potential for addictive side effects.  
Specific Aim  I: pramipexole blocks the activation of NLRP3 and consequent production 
and release of the proinflammatory cytokines IL -1, IL-6 and TNF -, and increases 
production of the anti -inflammatory cytokine interleukin -10 (IL -10).  
The goal of Aim I (Phase I) exp eriments is to examine the specific anti -
inflammatory mechanisms of pramipexole on PAMP, DAMP and opioid 
stimulated immune cells, THP -1 cells will be used.  
 
Specific Aim II: pramipexole treatment will provide therapeutic benefit to patients 
experiencing s uboptimal pain relief from current standard therapy with concurrent 
reduction of TLR4 -NLRP3 -cytokine expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells.  
 
The goal of Aim II (Phase II) will be to determine the therapeutic benefit of 
pramipexole for pain, whic h is a repurposing of this FDA -approved drug with a 
good safety profile.  
 
1.2. Our overarching hypothesis  is that pramipexole will control clinical pain by 
suppressing the activation of the TLR4 -NLRP3 -IL-1 pathway and prevent IL -1 
release from peripheral  immune cells. T hese findings have provided the current 
impetus to examine pain therapeutic drugs targeting immune -related factors either 
upstream or downstream of IL -1 signaling.  
 
2. Background  
2.1.  
The rate of US opioid -related overdose deaths from 2013  - 2016  increased by an 
astonishing 88% per year , while overdose deaths due to other drugs remained virtually 
unchanged [1, 2] . These increasing opioid -related death rates are linked to increases in 
prescription opioid misuse (medical and non -medical) as well as illicit opioid use (heroin ) 
[3, 4] . Despite medical prescription opioid misuse generally declin ing during recent years 
[5, 6] , the number of individuals who misuse prescription and illicit opioids continues to 
increase [7, 8] . These data reveal an emerging opioid misuse epidemic (medical , non-
medical, and illicit)  [5, 9-13]. Recent data reveal the discrete geographical regions where 
states have been hardest hit by this  growing epidemic [3]. Indeed, data analyzed from 
just 2014 alone reflect New Mexico  had under gone the greatest opioid -related  overdose 
death rate relative to other Mountain states, the Pacific and the Western south -central 
state regions [14]. These statistics reflect an unprecedented public health crisis of 
prescription opioid and heroin abuse both regionally and nationally. While the underlying 
causes related to this public health crisis are largely specul ative, one possible 
contributing factor  is the dramatic escalation of prescription opioid treatment for chronic 
pain over the past decade [15].  
The escalation of opioid treatment is particularly disconcerting beca use preclinical 
studies convincingly support that not only do opioids exert negative consequences for 
Non-opioid pramipexole suppresses immune NLRP3 reactivity for pain   
 Page 4 of 42 Version Date : August 8, 2019  pain [16-19], but also that chronic pain can be targeted by non -opioid drugs that lack 
direct actions on neurons  thereby reducing addiction liability  [20, 21] . In point of fact, a 
large number of reports using animal models reveal that trafficking immune cells to the 
central nervous system (CNS) and immune -like glial cells w ithin the CNS (e.g. 
astrocytes and microglia) are necessary for the development and maintenance of acute -
to-chronic pain problems [22-24]. Notably, experimental chronic pain  that is  induced by a 
variety of manipula tions model ing different etiologies of clinical pain is mediated by 
peripheral immune cell and CNS -derived proinflammatory cytokines that act to 
exacerbate pain signals. The most widely studied immune and glial cell factor is the 
proinflammatory cytokine, interleukin -IL-1 (IL-1). This cytokine, considered a 
“gatekeeper of inflammation and neuroexcitatory events”, is necessary and sufficient for 
mediating the transmissi on of pathological chronic pain. Evidence from preclinical and 
clinical studies  shows that blocking immu ne and/or glial IL -1 production and/or its 
action suppresses chronic pain [21]. 
The discovery that cytokines like IL-1 as well as others including tumor necrosis factor -
alpha (TNF -) were critical for mediating pathological chronic pain was significant 
because these immune -derived signaling molecules have been known for decades to 
play essential roles in mounting an inna te immune response (e.g. myeloid -derived cells 
such as macrophage but not T or B cells) including leukocyte migration to tissue 
damaged sites and fever. Indeed, IL-1 was originally identified as a pyrogenic factor 
stimulated by pathogen invasion such as b acteria; gram negative bacterial cell wall 
particles such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS). LPS is a widely -used immune activator to 
experimentally mimic pathogen invasion and induces macrophage release of IL-1 and 
TNF- [25]. LPS mimics pathogen invasion via receptor recognition of pathogen 
associated molecular pattern ( PAMPs ).  LPS delivered spinally in experimental mice 
develop pain that is now thought to occur via IL -1 release [26]. In other words, the pain 
system is capable of harnessing ancient molecular pathways of the innate immune 
system for the purpose of facilitating host survival and wound healing (triggering the 
disuse  of the injured tissue). The cytokine release from immune and glial cells is 
triggered upon factors released from stress/damaged cells, now characterized as 
danger -associated molecular patterns ( DAMPs ) that bind discrete immune receptors 
(discussed below).  Recognition of DAMPs allow cells to distinguish between non -injured 
vs. injured self [27]. Therefore, when conditions become pathological, adverse sterile 
neuroimmune stim ulation drives acute -to-chronic pain states via DAMP stimulation.  
Figure 1  is a schematic that represents the factors that stimulate and are induced within 
the classic immune pathway that ultimately lead to the release of proinflammatory 
cytokines like IL-1.  

Non-opioid pramipexole suppresses immune NLRP3 reactivity for pain   
 Page 5 of 42 Version Date : August 8, 2019   
However, even more intriguing is the mounting evidence that repeated opioid 
exposure/treatment results in significant negative consequences for pain [16, 20, 28, 29] . 
Preclinical studies of the past few year s show opioid drugs activate  the same innate 
immune proinflammatory pathways necessary for the production and release of IL -1 in 
both peripheral immune and glial cells [29-32] (see Figure 1 ). The action of opioids  on 
immune and glial cells was discovered to occur through the non -classical opioid 
receptor, toll -like receptor 4 (TLR4)  [32-35]. TLR4 activation triggers the active formation 
of the intracellular NOD -like recepto r protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome, a protein 
complex necessary for the ultimate production of IL -1[36, 37] . Thus, the activation of 
TLR4 on immune cells and glia by opioids may underlie the reported observation that 
chronic opioids paradoxically  induce pain (e.g. opioid induced hyperalgesia)  [38, 39] . It 
therefore follows that neuropathic pain is exacerbated and prolonged by opioid 
repeated/chronic treatment  [16, 28, 29] . In addition, recycling of opioid receptor upon 
activatio n by opiate drugs (e.g. morphine) is profoundly distorted in neurons such that 
the intracellular opiate -receptor  interaction is substantially prolonged  [40]. Taken 
together, these reports suggest non -opioid compoun ds may provide substantially better 
therapeutic benefit than opiate drugs . Therefore, the long-term goal  of this proposal is to 
identify non-opioid drugs that harness endogenous anti -inflammatory mechanisms 
resulting in the suppression of proinflammatory c ytokines such as IL -1 providing  a 
novel approach to treat chronic pain in people while lacking potential for addictive side 
effects.  
Pramipexole: FDA approved drugs that demonstrate an excellent safety profile in 
humans while also demonstrating the above -noted anti -inflammat ory profile could be 
explored as repurposed drugs for non -opioid pain therapeutics . One such 
compound that satisfies this profile is pramipexole, which is now documented to reduce 
inflammation in several preclinical animal models of peripheral inflammatory  pain [41]. 
While this study did not examine rodent pain behaviors, the classic hallmarks of hindpaw 
edema and neutrophil accumulation were assessed, with pramipexole significantly 
blunting these inflammatory proce sses. In a separate study examining brain 
inflammatory cytokines in mice following low -dose LPS inflammation, IL -1
 mRNA levels 
were blunted following treatment with pramipexole [42]. Pramipexole is well -documented  
as a preferred dopamine -2/3 (D2/D3) receptor agonist that is FDA approved for 
alleviating movement disorders in Parkinson Disease and for treating restless leg 
syndrome, with modest therapeutic outcomes [43-48]. Therefore, based on the 
documented safety profile of pramipexole, we propose to explore whether it exerts anti -
inflammatory (anti - IL-1beta actions) resulting in therapeutic pain suppression in people.  
 
2.2. Preliminary data.  
All experiments in this phase will b e performed at the Center for Molecular Discovery 
(Dr. Sklar, co -I and Director of this core) using the human monocytic leukemia cell line, 
THP-1. This cell line is routinely used in the core facility to examine drug effects on the 
TLR4 -NLP3 -IL-1 pathway by quantifying dose -dependent effects on IL -1 protein 
release. Upon stimulation by LPS, these cells can provide a reliable indication of specific 
TLR4 -NLRP3 activation as measured by the production of the adaptor protein apoptosis -
associated speck -like pr otein (ASC) and IL -1 release [49]. Additionally, THP -1 cells 
activate upon adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which signal to cells as a DAMP [28, 49] . 
Non-opioid pramipexole suppresses immune NLRP3 reactivity for pain   
 Page 6 of 42 Version Date : August 8, 2019  It is important to note that following TLR4 activation by PAMPs, DAMPs or opioids, 
subsequent phosphorylation of protein kinases p -p38 and p65 and nuclear factor kB 
(NFkB), generates NLRP3 inflammasome complex formation required for IL -1 
transcription and production [50]. 
Figure 2 demonstrates the feasibility of utilizing THP -1 (human myeloid cells) upon 
stimulation as a cellular screen to examine the suppression of cellular activation, as 
measured by a reduction in IL -1 following drug application. Other reports show that 
following LPS stimulation, Alprostadil, also known as prostaglandin E1 (PGE1), reduces 
NF-KB activity and spinal proinflammatory cytokine IL -1 and TNF  production  [51, 52] . 
In the current pilot data provided Dr. Sklar (co -Investigator), THP -1 stimulated cells with 
LPS reveal an Alprostadil dose -dependent reduction in IL -1. Conversely, examination 
of Resveratrol, a drug that is characterized to act at the integr in V receptor to induce 
phagocytosis [53], generates a distinctly different profile of IL -1 release from THP -1 
cells. While Resveratrol is characterized to induce the anti -inflammatory related nuclear 
receptor, peroxisome proliferator -activated receptor gamma (PPAR ) [54], increased IL-
1 is observed ab ove levels induced by LPS stimulation (red triangle) suggesting higher 
doses may be inducing general increases in transcriptional activity, a known function of 
PPAR. As such, the pattern of THP1 activation in response to drug in the presence of 
stimulatio n can be used to indicate pramipexole -dependent actions in reducing the 
TLR4 -NLRP3 - IL-1 inflammatory pathway. As depicted in Figure 1, PAMPs and 
DAMPS can be applied to stimulate TLR4 -NLRP3. Therefore, LPS and the DAMP, high 
mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) will be used to stimulate THP -1 cells. HMGB1 is relevant 
to the proposed study because it is released from damaged nerve terminals in the spinal 
cord and characterized to mediate persistent pain [55]. 
 
Figure 3: Based on evidence demonstrating general anti -inflammatory effects of 
pramipexole (reduced IL -1 production, neutrophil accumulation and edema formation), 
a pilot study was performed in mice to examine the effects of  an intravenous injection of 
pramipexole on pathological light touch sensitivity in a model of peripheral sciatic 
neuropathy.  A widely -used and well -characterized rodent model of peripheral 
neuropathy was applied by loose ligation of 3 chromic gut sutures  around one sciatic 
nerve (chronic constriction injury; CCI) that leads to hindpaw sensitivity to light touch, 
clinically referred to as allodynia. Allodynia is a hallmark of pathological sensory 
processing and is frequently a problem in pain patients. In this figure, compared to sham 
(no surgery) controls with vehicle or pramipexole treatment, mice with CCI and i.v. 

Non-opioid pramipexole suppresses immune NLRP3 reactivity for pain   
 Page 7 of 42 Version Date : August 8, 2019  vehicle/placebo treatment reveal stable allodynia (light touch responses from 0.023 – 
0.068 g) throughout the timecourse (white squares). Conv ersely, those mice with CCI 
followed by i.v. pramipexole reveal a profound reversal from allodynia (0.5 or 5.0 ug; 
blue or red triangle, respectively) with allodynia returning by 24 hrs after drug injection in 
keeping with the reported half -life of pramipe xole [43, 48] . These data support the 
exploration of pramipexole as a possible inhibitor of the TLR4 -NLRP3 -IL-1 pathway, 
and as such, a possible chronic pain therapeutic that is already FDA -approved for the 
treatment of other clinical conditions (explored in Phase II  of the current proposal).  
 
 
 
2.3. Additional Background and Rationale    
A growing body of evidence supports that repeated opioid exposure triggers TLR4 -
NLRP3 -IL-1 activation and release, which may underli e the development of opioid -
induced prolongation of pain and hyperalgesia [16, 28, 29, 39] . THP1 cells are 
characterized to respond to opioid stimulation by potentiating NFkB [56], and naloxone, 
a known antagonist at the mu opioid receptor, also blocks TLR4 activation [17, 33 -35]. 
Indeed, naloxone prevents LPS -induced NLRP3 complex formation (NLRP3 + ASC) in 
THP-1 cells [49]. Results from these experiments could lead to (a) further support that 
pramipexole is a viable alternative to opioid as a pain therapeutic, and/or ( b) co -
administration of opioid compounds with pramipexole. The implications are far reaching.  
To capture TLR4 immune cell activation by distinct mechanisms, PAMPs, DAMPs or 
opioids, THP -1 cells will be stimulated with either LPS, HMGB1 (a DAMP) or an opio id 
compound (either beta -endorphins or morphine). Increasing doses of pramipexole will be 
given, and levels of IL -1 will be analyzed. In addition, cell supernatant and lysates will 

Non-opioid pramipexole suppresses immune NLRP3 reactivity for pain   
 Page 8 of 42 Version Date : August 8, 2019  be collected to evaluate protein and mRNA for TLR4, p38, NFkB, NLRP3, Caspase -1, 
which is an enzyme activated only after NLRP3 complex formation with ASC that is 
required for mature IL -1 release, as well as the proinflammatory cytokines, IL -1, TNF -
 and HMGB1, and IL -10  
 
 
3. Study Design  
3.1. This is a proof -of-concept randomized  placebo -controlled clinical trial . 
 
3.2. Describe blinding, if applicable .  
 All subjects will pick up the allotted c apsules from the UNMH Clinical Pharmacy 
that will dispense either pramipexole or placebo. A randomization table will determine 
which subject will receive pramipexole or placebo.  
 
4. Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria  
 
4.1. Recruitment of Subjects  and Inclus ion 
 
Subjects who qualify for inclusion will be those p otential subjects identified by Dr. 
Koshkin being seen at the UNM Pain Clinic who are experiencing pain with “suboptimal ” 
pain relief (defined as discussed below in this section) by standard pain treat ment. A 
randomization table for all subjects receiving pramipexole vs. placebo will be generated 
such that the Clinical Research Coordinator will use as a template when dispensing drug 
at the time of consent.  All types of chronic pain will be considered, a nd thus, specific 
types of chronic pain will not be part of the inclusion or exclusion criteria. Non -English, 
Spanish speaking subjects will be included. Adults 18 yrs . or older will be included.  
Women who are not post -menopausal or have not undergone an 
oophorectomy/hysterectomy will be excluded.  
 
Non-opioid pramipexole suppresses immune NLRP3 reactivity for pain   
 Page 9 of 42 Version Date : August 8, 2019  Initial screening will occur at the time when Dr. Koshkin is evaluating the patient in the 
pain clinic. The Electronic Medical Record database is up -to-date and will be viewed at 
the time of the clinical evaluati on. Data that will be evaluated and collected are: sex, 
weight, height, age, race/ethnicity, years post -menopausal, prior 
oophorectomy/hysterectomy, years under pain treatment, pain diagnosis (etiology), and 
type of insurance.   
At the time Dr. Koshkin is evaluating a patient that meets the inclusion criteria, 3 
standardized questions will be asked:  
(1) Are you happy with the amount of pain relief so far?  
(2) Would you like to try something else to improve your pain relief?  
(3) Are you able to do everyth ing you want to do with the current treatment?  
 
At this time, systemized exclusion criteria will be evaluated as noted in the table below.  
 
 
 
Based on the Electronic Medical Record, Dr. Koshkin will have access to information 
regarding prior history of r enal impairment. If Dr. Koshkin suspects the possible presence 
of renal impairment, a blood panel will be evaluated prior to potential patient 
participation.  
As indicated in the Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria table, Patients with Parkinson’s Disease 
or patie nts who are taking prescription medications that act as dopamine agonists are 
excluded from the study.  
 
Note that only those patients who are  pregnant will be excluded. A pregnancy test at the 
time of enrollment and at mid -term (end of 2 weeks of the 4 wee k study) when subjects 
check in with the Clinical Research Coordinator. The second pregnancy test will act to 
mitigate risks of false negative pregnancy test results at the time of enrollment. .  
 
4.2. children, a particular racial or ethnic group, etc. and  provide justification . 
We will attempt to enroll an equal number of males and females. There are n o race - or 
ethnic specific  questions in this protocol. However, in an attempt to include a balanced 
approach for enrolling non-Caucasian and Caucasian p opula tions participating in this 
clinical trial, approximately 50% of the study subjects will make up these two 
populations. An attempt to enroll African American and Native American (American 
Indian) populations that will make up the remaining 50% of the study  population will be 
planned to reflect the unique cultural and ethnic diversity of Albuquerque. A review of 
this targeted enrollment progress in this area will be made quarterly, and if minority 
recruitment is not meeting expectations by the end of the 2nd quarter, further guidance 
from the CTSC will be utilized.  
 
Non-opioid pramipexole suppresses immune NLRP3 reactivity for pain   
 Page 10 of 42 Version Date : August 8, 2019  Diverse socioeconomic  backgrounds will also be an important factor for inclusion.   The 
UNM Clinical Neuroscience Center serves a diverse population, and recruitment will 
occur among all represente d groups.   
 
INCLUSION OF CHILDREN  
 
This research study will include only individuals 18 years of age and older because 
chronic pain is rare in pediatric populations.  The mechanism underlying its development 
is not typically expressed until adulthood.  Any pediatric chronic pain cases encountered 
are thus likely to have a substantial idiopathic component.   This factor along with the 
small sample would make results interpretation difficult or impossible for pediatric 
patients.  
 
“Suboptimal pain relief/ scores” is vague because the Brief Pain Inventory address two 
discrete aspects of pain: (1) pain severity and (2) pain interference that are subjectively 
evaluated (Tan, Jensen et al. 2004, Walton, Beattie et al. 2016) . The scores obtained from 
aspects of the scale (items 1 -6) that evaluate pain severity and the quality of the pain 
(burning vs. aching) focuses on current or recent pain. However, the scores obtained from 
aspects that target affective and physical interfe rence (item 9 with 7 subscales) of pain 
experience and provides a more complete evaluation of issues surrounding quality of life 
that are frequently (but not always) considered more critical to patient’s pain experience. 
Item #8 of the pain scale (“In the past 24 hours, how much pain relief have pain 
treatments or medications provided? Please circle the percentage that most shows how 
much relief you have received”) targets the key issue of “suboptimal” pain relief, but 
only in the past 24 hrs, and provides a “snapshot” of the patient’s chronic pain relief. 
Therefore, while it may seem to oversimplify the patient’s level of pain relief, patient 
scores 5 or greater on most items in the Brief Pain Inventory will be considered 
“suboptimal”.  
  
5. Number of Subjects  
5.4. All subjects will be recruited  from the UNMH outpatient population  from  the 
UNMH Pain Center.  
5.5. The target sample size is 30 subjects with complete data.  The investigators may 
recruit up to 45 patients to allow for any dropouts.   
5.6. All subject recruited will  participate. There will be no screening after 
recruitment.  
 
6. Study Timelines  
6.4. Describe:  
 The duration the subject will participate in the study is 4 weeks  
 The duration anticipated to enroll all subjects  may require 10 -11 months  
 The expected duration for the investigators to complete the study analys es will 
be 12 months, with most of the analysis occurring in  the final months 11 -12.

 Page 11 of 42 Version Date : August 8, 2019  7. Study Endpoints  
7.4. The primary  endpoint is the paper -and-pencil survey, the Brief Pain Inventory.  
The secondary study endpoint s will be mRNA and protein analysis from blood 
samples provided at the initiation and terminal of the study . 
7.5. Safety endpoints of the study will include the following: (1) Worsening of pain 
score or increased verbal dissatisfaction with pain relief, (2) sudden onset of 
sleep without warning, (3) intense urges, (4) hallucinations and/or psychotic -like 
behaviors, (5) fever, and (6) orthostatic hypotension. While the patients who 
experience these adverse events, dosing with pramipexole will require a 50% 
step-wise reduction over a period of two weeks. Given the maximal allowable 
dose is 0. 75 mg, this prescribed step -wise reduction  is well within the 
manufacturer’s recommended tapering of pramipexole, which the recommended 
dose reduction is 0.375 per day.  
7.6. No explora tory endpoint  are in the current study . 
8. Research Setting  
8.4. Patients interested in participating in the study will be gided by a Clinical 
Research Coordinator who will collect information from the Brief Pain Inventory 
(short form) questionnaire and will also collect and store a blood sample for 
assay at the termination of the project period.  
8.5. All patients will be recruited from the UNMH Pain clinic and examined by Dr. 
Koshkin (co -I). 
8.6.  All research procedures will be conducted in the CTSC clinical laboratory. Al l 
analytics will be conducted in the Center for Molecular Drug Discovery, a CTSC 
translational lab directed by Dr. Sklar (co -I). 
8.7. A community advisory board  will not be involved  
8.8. No research will be conducted outside  of UNMH and UNM -CTSC  
9. Resources Available  
9.4. The PI and study staff  have received training for clinical trials. Dr. Milligan 
(PhD) is a basic scientist conducting the cell assays and interpreting the data 
results. Dr. Sklar(PhD)  is a basic scientist directing the CTSC core for 
conducting the cell as says and interpreting the resultant data. Dr. Petersen (PhD) 
is a statistician and familiar with clinical trials designs, and Dr. Koshkin (MD) is 
a physician who specialized in pain treatment at the UNMH Pain Clinic.     
9.5. Dr. Koshkin, MD will be responsible for medical decision -making and ordering 
and evaluation of necessary diagnostics and therapeutics .  
9.6. Dr. Koshkin treats 15 -30 patients daily at the UNMH Pain Clinic.  With this high 
access to patients, the goal of enrolling 30 patients during an 11 month pe riod is 
predicted to be very feasible.  
All 30 recrui ted patients will be needed with no further screening.

 Page 12 of 42 Version Date : August 8, 2019  An estimated 6  hrs per patient will be devoted to consent, completing surveys, 
blood draw, scheduling and dispensing the pramipexole or placebo  by the 
Clinical Research Coordinator . 
 The facilities  used will be at the CTSC where consent, enrollment, scheduling 
visits, obtaining blood samples, completion of the Brief Pain Inventory 
survey, dispensing drugs at initiation and at midterm (end of week 2,) a nd 
collecting unused drug at termination.  For the biological assays from human 
cell lines or from blood samples, the clinical laboratory arm of the CTSC, 
Center for Molecular Drug Discovery, will be used.  
 The availability of medical and/or psychological re sources that subjects might 
need as a result of an anticipated consequences of the human research  will be 
avaialve by Dr. Koshkin or by referral from Dr. Koshkin. The anticipated 
consequences of the research will be (1) improved pain relief, (2) no change in 
pain relief, or (3) a worsening of pain. Dr. Koshkin will continue to monitor 
patients after the study is terminated, as these patients will continue to receive 
outpatient care from the pain clinic.  
 All persons assisting with the research  will have group meetings once every 3 
months in the conference room in the Dept of Anesthesiology. Goals of each 
meeting will include research progress updates, preliminary findings of the 
pain scores derived from the Brief Pain Inventory, problems or unanticipated 
adve rse events, how these adverse events were managed, and action items for 
continued progress or needed to adjust to potential changes. Dr. Koshkin will 
provide updates on his clinical observations from his pain patients, Dr. Sklar 
will provide updates with r egard to progress or impediments of cell assays, 
Dr. Milligan will provide a summary of data collected from the cell based 
assay from Phase I (Specific Aim I) and Dr. Petersen will provide input for 
preparation of  appropriate stati stical analysis, manuscr ipt preparation and 
future NIH NIDA grant preparation should the data support the research 
hypothesis.    
 If CTSC resources are being accessed, the signed CTSC resources attachment 
must be uploaded on the CTSC Submission page in Click.

12.  Study Procedures  
 
The goal of Phase II w ill be to determine the therapeutic benefit of pramipexole for pain, 
which is a repurposing of this FDA -approved drug with a good safety profile. In 
collaboration with Dr. Koshkin (co -I at UNMH Pain Clinic ), patients from the UNM pain 
clinic will be recrui ted who are experiencing modest  or suboptimal  pain relief. The patient 
will meet the CTSC Clinical Research Coordinator, who will escort the patient to the 
Clinical Research Lab. At the time, an explanation of the study, consent, the Brief Pain 
Inventory s urvey will be completed, blood draw and Clincard will be given to the patient 
($15/visit). Scheduling for the midterm visit to the CTSC (at the end of two weeks) will be 
determined. At the time of consent, all patients will be under standard pain treatment  and 
will be randomized into two groups: (1) patients receiving pramipexole in addition to their 
standard ongoing pain treatment, or (2) no pramipexole but will continue to receive the 
standard pain treatment. Patients will be followed up in the morning at  weekly intervals 
to provide pain scores either by phone (for week 1 and 3), or by return visit (for end of 
week 2 and at the end of week 4) until study termination which is at the end of week 4. . 
At the initiation of the study and at the end of 4 weeks, b lood will be collected and 
analyzed for mRNA for TLR4, p38, NFkB, NLRP3 -ASC, Caspase -1, IL -1, TNF -, 
HMGB1, and IL -10. The dose and route of administration of pramipexole will be identical 
to that previously approved for the treatment of Restless Legs Syn drome and according 
to manufacturer’s recommended prescribing protocol (Mirapex, Boehringer Ingelheim 
Int. GmbH). Briefly, oral dosage will be titrated each week to achieve a weekly total daily 
dose of 0. 125 (mg), 0. 250, 0.5 or 0.750 . Patients will take  one capsule containing 
pramipexole of placebo 2 -3 hours before bedtime.   
 
Patient recruitment, assessment of Brief Pain Inventory ( BPI):  Pain scores  and blood 
draws will be conducted at the CTSC Participant Clinical Interactions Unit with the CTSC 
Clinical Research Coordinator. Blood samples  collected by the CTSC Clinical Research 
Coordinator will be analyzed at the Center for Molecular Discovery by personnel from Dr. 
Milligan’s lab, trained by personnel from the Center for Molecular Drug Discovery 
(Dire ctor; Dr. Sklar, co -I). Personnel from the Milligan lab  have expertise in inflammatory 
marker analysis from PBMCs [57, 58] . All freshly collected blood samples will be frozen 
and stored by the  Clinical Research Co ordinator at the CTSC Clinical Laboratory and will 
be transported to the Center for Molecular Drug Discovery once ALL of the samples for 
the study (all 30 patients) have been collected. This is to allow for assay to be conducted 
at the same time to avoid p otential effect of ‘time of assay’ that may impact data.  
 
All subjects will therefore meet with the CTSC Clinical Research Coordinator for a total 
of 3 times; at the initiation of the study, at mid -term when the second batch of drug is 
dispensed and unused  drug is returned, and at termination for a second and final blood 
draw and providing all completed Brief Pain Inventory surveys ( 5/patient).  At the 
termination of the study, patien ts will turn in their paper copies  of the Brief Pain 
Inventory questionna ire completed for each week of the study (total 4 weeks). Original 
data records are important to demonstrate all necessary phys ical documentation of the 
study . 
 
Non-opioid pramipexole suppresses immune NLRP3 reactivity for pain   
 Page 14 of 42 Version Date : August 8, 2019  Pramipexole:  FDA approved drugs that demonstrate an excellent safety profile in 
humans while al so demonstrating the above -noted anti -inflammatory profile  could be 
explored as repurposed drugs for non -opioid pain therapeutics . One such 
compound that satisfies this profile is pramipexol e, which is now documented to reduce 
inflammation in several precl inical animal models of peripheral inflammatory pain [41]. 
While t his study did not examine rodent pain behaviors, the classic hallmarks of hindpaw 
edema and neutrophil accumulation were assessed, with pramipexole significantly 
blunting these inflammatory processes. In a separate study examining brain 
inflammatory cytokines in mice following low -dose LPS inflammation, IL -1 mRNA levels 
were blunted following treatment with pramipexole [42]. Pramipexole is well -documented 
as a preferred dopamine -2/3 (D2/D3)  receptor agonist that is FDA approved for 
alleviating movement disorders in Parkinson Disease and for treating restless leg 
syndrome, with modest therapeutic outcomes [43-48]. Therefore, based on the 
documented safety profile of pramipexole, we propose to explore whether it exerts anti -
inflammatory (anti - IL-1 actions) resulting in therapeutic pain suppression in people. 
Our overarching hypothesis  is that pramipexole will control clinical pain by suppressing 
the activation of the TLR4 -NLRP3 -IL-1 pathway and prevent IL -1 release from 
peripheral immune cells. These findings have provided the current impetus to examine 
pain therapeutic drugs targeting immune -related factors either upstream or downstream 
of IL-1 signaling.  
 
Below is a table and brief description of the planned dispensing pattern . The goal for 
patients is to achieve improved  pain control  which will be a score 3 points lower on the 
BPI scale. However, in some subjects, a requirement of titrating dose -increases  will be 
needed to achieve improved pain control .

13. Data Analysis  
Experimental Design for Ph ase I  (Aim I) . The goal of these experiments is to examine 
the specific anti -inflammatory mechanisms of pramipexole on PAMP, DAMP and opioid 
stimulated immune cells, THP -1 cells will be used.  
  
A growing body of evidence supports that repeated opioid expos ure triggers TLR4 -
NLRP3 -IL-1 activation and release, which may underlie the development of opioid -
induced prolongation of pain and hyperalgesia [16, 28, 29, 39] . THP1 cells are 
characterized to respond to opioid s timulation by potentiating NFkB [56], and naloxone, 
a known antagonist at the mu opioid receptor, also blocks TLR4 activation [17, 33 -35]. 
Indeed, naloxone prevents LPS -induced NLRP3 complex formation (NLRP3 + ASC) in 
THP-1 cells [49]. Results from these experiments could lead to (a) further support that 
pramip exole is a viable alternative to opioid as a pain therapeutic, and/or (b) co -
administration of opioid compounds with pramipexole. The implications are far reaching.  
To capture TLR4 immune cell activation by distinct mechanisms, PAMPs, DAMPs or 
opioids, TH P-1 cells will be stimulated with either LPS, HMGB1 (a DAMP) or an opioid 
compound (either beta -endorphins or morphine). Increasing doses of pramipexole will be 
given, and levels of IL -1 will be analyzed. In addition, cell supernatant and lysates will 
be collected to evaluate protein and mRNA for TLR4, p38, NFkB, NLRP3, Caspase -1, 
which is an enzyme activated only after NLRP3 complex formation with ASC that is 
required for mature IL -1 release, as well as the proinflammatory cytokines, IL -1, TNF -
 and HMG B1, and IL -10  
Statistical Analysis.  The experimental design is 2 (vehicle vs. drug) X 4 (TLR4 
stimulants) X 6 (doses of pramipexole), and therefore will require a 3 -way repeated 
measure ANOVA (using IBM SPSS Statistics version 24 (IBM; RRID:SCR_002865).  All 
biological wells will be conducted in triplicate.  
 
Experimental Design for Phase I I (Aim II) . At the time of consent, all patients will be 
under standard pain treatment and will be randomized into two groups:  (1) patients 
Non-opioid pramipexole suppresses immune NLRP3 reactivity for pain   
 Page 16 of 42 Version Date : August 8, 2019  receiving pramipexole in addit ion to their standard ongoing pain treatment, or (2) no 
pramipexole but will continue to receive the standard pain treatment. Patients will be 
followed up in the morning at weekly intervals to provide pain scores by phone for a total 
of 4 weeks. At the ini tiation of the study and at the end of 4 weeks, blood will be 
collected and analyzed for mRNA for TLR4, p38, NFkB, NLRP3 -ASC, Caspase -1, IL-1, 
TNF-, HMGB1, and IL -10. Dr. Escalona from the Dept of Psychiatry at the VA will be a 
consultant, as he is currently using pramipexole to treat depression in pain patients (see 
letter of support), and can provide valuable feedback on interpretation.  
The dose and route of administration of pramipexole will be lower to that previously 
approved for the treatment of Parkinson’s Disease and Restless Legs Syndrome and 
according to manufacturer’s recommended prescribing protocol (Mirapex, Boehringer 
Ingelheim I nt. GmbH). Briefly, oral dosage will be titrated each week to achieve  effective 
pain control, with increases occurring  at weekly total daily dose of 0. 125 (mg), 0. 250, 
0.500 mg for weeks 1 -2, and 3 -4, respectively. The highest daily dose will not exceed 
0.5 mg. Patient recruitment, assessment of BPI pain scores, and blood draws will be 
conducted at the CTSC Participant Clinical Interactions Unit, where monetary 
compensation for participation will also be provided. Blood samples  collected by staff at 
the CT SC will be analyzed at the Center for Molecular Discovery by personnel from Dr. 
Milligan’s lab who have expertise in inflammatory marker analysis from PBMCs [57, 58] . 
 
Study drug compounding: Pramipexole and placeb o. The following operating procedure 
has been recommended by the UNM Clinical Pharmacist, Susan Kunkel:  
1. Both active and placebo doses will be compounded into capsules. Both types are prepared in 
100-count batches by packing powdered material into empty,  usually gelatin -based, capsule 
shells. To make active capsules, a quantity of tablets equal to 100 doses is pulverized and 
then blended with a sufficient quantity of microcrystalline cellulose, a pharmacologically 
inert powder, to fully pack each capsule in the batch. The filler (cellulose) is necessary to 
ensure each capsule contains a uniform dose. Each placebo capsule will be fully and 
uniformly packed with plain microcrystalline cellulose . 
2. Each equivalent active dose will look identical to its corre sponding placebo. Because the 
intent  of the study is NOT  to conceal the timing of dose changes from subjects, it has been 
strongly recommend ed that different colored capsules  for different dose levels (keeping 
active/placebo pairs identically matched, of c ourse)  be maintained . Based on prior 
experience, not color -coding dose levels (and similarly placebo) will greatly increase the 
chance for medication errors. Given it is very common for manufactured medications to have 
different colors at different dose le vels, most subjects will likely be familiar with this practice. 
The alternative would be for all active capsules to contain 0.125 mg of pramipexole and have 
subjects take more capsules for a higher dose level.  Those subjects who end up at the highest 
dose level  (0.75mg)  would then have to take three  capsules per dose . 
3. IDS' operating hours are Monday through Friday from approximately 8:00 to 4:30, excluding 
UNMH holidays. Dispensing times will occur during these periods. Most  days, staffing consists  
of an IDS pharmacy technician (John Cocanower) and an IDS pharmacist. There are two 
trained IDS backup pharmacists (Susan Meoli and Audrey Dettwiller) to cover Susan Kunkel’s 
leave periods. Accordingly, trained IDS staff will be available during the IDS operating hours 
barring rare exceptions when, for example, the IDS pharmacy technician is out on vacation 
and the IDS pharmacist needs leave for a meeting. Dispensing during evenings, nights, 
weekends, and holidays, will not occur.

14. Provisions to Monitor the Data to Ensure the Safety of Subjects  
This section is required when research  involves more than Minimal Risk  to subjects.  
Describe:  
Contact Information  
Standard procedures, which are comprised of in -person description of the stu dy and 
consent, completion of the Brief Pain Inventory (short form), and electronic 
communication, which is used to track pain scores via phone call on weeks 1 and 3. We 
will identify all subjects with a sequentially assigned subject ID number and subject 
initials. The subject ID number will be utilized for data collection (questionnaires, blood 
specimens, and database entry). To ensure subject confidentiality, no names, social 
security numbers, or UNM pain clinic numbers will be included in any communicati on 
external to UNM. Names, addresses, telephone numbers, and any other information 
needed for recruitment, study involvement, and tracking will be obtained and maintained 
locally by the study staff (UNM CTSC Clinical Research Coordinator).  All computer fi les 
and systems will be password protected and accessible by authorized Informatics study 
staff only (CTSC Analyst/Programmer).  
 
 
Data Safety: The risk of breach of confidentiality is considered to be similar or even less 
than a data safety compromise of n on-research clinical electronic health record s. To 
minimize potential breach of confidentiality, a ll electronic data will be maintained in a 
password -protected database to which only study staff with a legitimate need will have 
access. All paper  documentat ion will be kept in a secure file cabinet in a locked office.  
The CRC will be responsible for keeping the data in a password protected database with 
hard copies of the BPI kept in a locked file cabinet in the CTSC  during the study period . 
Monitoring will o ccur daily or when needed while enrolling subjects and collecting BPI 
scores. After the study  period, Drs. Milligan and Petersen will maintain the study records 
(electronic version of the BPI scores, mRNA and protein analysis from cell -based assays) 
in Dr.  Petersen’s office in a password protected databased and hard copies of the BPI 
well be kept in a locked file cabinet in a locked room (Dr. Milligan’s and Dr. Petersen’s 
offices).  
 
Safety Monitoring Plan:  
While there are no contraindications associated wi th pramipexole, the collection and 
reporting of adverse are as follows:  
 
The collection and reporting of adverse events will occur at: (1) the time of the phone 
conversation at the end of weeks 1 and 3 with the CRC who will collect the Brief Pain 
Inventory  scores, (2) at the end of week 2, the time of the mid -term in -person meeting 
with the CRC when the subject will provide the scores of the BPI for that week and will 
pick up drug dispense #2, (3) At the final in -person with the CRC, at the termination of 
the study at week 4, and (4) at any point during the study when the subject calls the CRC 
to report an adverse event or when the subject calls Dr. Koshkin. All adverse events will 
be recorded by the CRC and kept with the subject’s study records.  
 
Non-opioid pramipexole suppresses immune NLRP3 reactivity for pain   
 Page 18 of 42 Version Date : August 8, 2019  Symptomati c orthostatic hypotension and other adverse reactions will be monitored 
during dose escalation during weeks 1 -2, as well as throug hout the 4 -week study, as part 
of the routine contact with participants.  
 
The HRRC will be notified as per usual rules within  five business days after the PI 
becomes aware of any severe adverse events, as defined by the Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0, published 11/27/2017 by the National 
Cancer Institute.  The CTCAE defines adverse events of g rade 3 or higher as “severe.”  
 
Safety monitoring will occur in two tracks.  In one track, monitoring will occur as part of 
the routine (weekly) study -related contact.  Study personnel will include screening for 
adverse events as noted in the included scrip t.  The PI will be notified promptly of any 
moderate or severe adverse events identified in this screening process.  All screening 
information will be provided to the PI for review in the second track of the monitoring 
procedure, and for entry in a Non -Reportable Log, as appropriate.  
 
The second track of safety monitoring will be an interim review conducted shortly 
(within one week) after enrollment of the 15th participant.  All relevant study information, 
including but not limited to pain and dosage data, any adverse events identified in 
screening (regardless of CTCAE grade), and any direct adverse -event reports to 
investigator Dr. Koshkin, will be included in this review.  PI Dr. Erin Milligan will 
conduct this review with assistance from investigators Dr.  Koshkin and Dr. Petersen.  
The HRRC will be notified if adverse events of CTCAE grade ≥2 have been identified in 
three or more patients in the active (pramipexole) arm at the time of this review.  As 
noted above, the HRRC will be notified within five business days of any adverse events 
of grade 3 or higher, regardless of timing with respect  to this interim review.  
 
Stopping rules: Enrollment will be at least temporarily suspended if any of the following 
conditions are met:  
 Instructions from the HRRC to suspend or terminate enrollment.  
 A second adverse event of CTCAE grade 3 or higher among s tudy participants.  
As with any first one, this event would be reported to the HRRC.  
 Any event that, in the opinion of the PI, represents substantial unanticipated risk 
(i.e. a risk not included in the FDA pramipexole package insert or consent 
documentatio n) to study participants.  
After any suspension, enrollment would only be resumed on instructions from the HRRC.  
 
If enrollment is suspended, study -related treatment will continue as normal for any active 
study participants, except in the case of the third (substantial unanticipated risk) bullet 
point above.  If study enrollment is suspended for that reason, participants will be advised 
to taper off or terminate study drug use as soon as possible.  
 
 
Adequacy of Protection Against Risks  
 
A. Recruitment and In formed Consent  
Non-opioid pramipexole suppresses immune NLRP3 reactivity for pain   
 Page 19 of 42 Version Date : August 8, 2019   
Recruitment of Subjects  
Subjects who qualify for inclusion will be recruited for the study. Potential subjects will be 
identified by Dr. Koshkin who are experiencing pain with suboptimal pain relief by 
standard pain treatment. A randomizati on table for all subjects receiving pramipexole vs. 
placebo will be generated such that the Clinical Research Coordinator will use as a 
template when dispensing drug at the time of consent.  
 
B. Protections Against Risk  
 
Confidentiality of Subjects  
Subjects  will be assigned a study ID number. Linkage to name and other personal 
identifying information  will be kept in a password -protected master database of enrolled 
subjects that will include subject name,  date of birth, address, telephone numbers, 
race/ethnic ity. The Brief Pain Inventory survey and records will be kept in a locked 
cabinet in a secure room by the CTSC Clinical Research Coordinator and will be 
accessible only to study staff. The computerized study database will only be accessible 
to study person nel using a password -protected system. For this study, we will utilize 
REDCap Survey, a secure, password protected data collection and management tool 
hosted by UNM’s CTSC. Patients will use a study ID number to complete the electronic 
surveys to further e nsure patient confidentiality. No personal identifying information will 
be used in data analysis or study reports. Subjects will sign also sign a HIPAA 
authorization as part of the informed consent process.  
Dose escalation risks  
Dose titration will increas e by double if efficacy has not been achieved by the end of one 
week at the lower initial dose. A dose of 0.125 mg pramipexole once per night for 1 week 
is initiated for all subjects. At the end of week one, subjects will either increase the dose 
by double , 0.25 mg if pain relief is not satisfactory, or will remain at 0.125 mg if relief is 
satisfactory.  A 2nd titration may occur at the end of week 2, with the dose escalat ing from 
0.25 mg to 0. 75 mg per night . Please see flow chart indi cating the ‘Dispensing 
Guideline’, as an illustration.  
 
Safety will be monitored either at the time the CRC asks the subject to provide their 
scores on the Brief Pain Inventory, or when the subject calls Dr. Koshkin reporting 
adverse experiences as indicat ed in safety endpoints. Upon consent, subjects will be 
instructed to call Dr. Koshkin should any adverse experiences noted in the ‘safety 
endpoints’ occur during the study period. After the study period is terminated, subjects 
will continue to see Dr. Kosh kin in follow -up visits as needed.  
 
All risks associated with pramipexole (Mirapex; Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals) 
according to the manufacturer are:  
1. Falling asleep during activities of daily living. Sudden onset of sleep may occur without 
warn ing. Somnolence is a common occurrence in patients receiving pramipexole at doses 
above 1.5 mg/day (0.5 mg three times a day). In controlled clinical trials in Restless Leg 
Syndrome,  patients treated with MIRAPEX tablets at doses of 0.25 -0.75 mg once a day , 
the incidence of somnolence was 6% compared to an incidence of 3% for placebo -treated 
patients.  
Non-opioid pramipexole suppresses immune NLRP3 reactivity for pain   
 Page 20 of 42 Version Date : August 8, 2019  2. Symptomatic orthostatic hypotension: Dopamine agonists, in clinical studies and clinical 
experience, appear to impair the systemic regulation of blood pres sure, with resulting 
orthostatic hypotension, especially during dose escalation. Despite clear orthostatic 
effects in normal volunteers, the reported incidence of clinically significant orthostatic 
hypotension was not greater among those assigned to pramip exole tablets than among 
those assigned to placebo.  
 
Symptomatic orthostatic hypotension will be monitored during dose escalation during 
weeks 1 -2, as well as throughout the 4 -week study. Monitoring will occur as detailed in 
“Collection and Reporting of Ad verse Events”.  
 
3. Impulse control/Compulsive behaviors: Patients may experience  compulsive be haviors and 
other intense urges taking one or more of the medications, including  pramipexole, that 
increase central dopaminergic tone and that are generally used for the treatment of 
Parkinson’s disease. For this reason, Parkinson’s Disease patients are not included in this 
study. However, if patients or their caregivers experience increased gambling urges, 
sexual urges, uncontrolled spending or other urges while b eing treated with pramipexol e, 
subjects will be asked to report this to Dr. Koshkin and/or the CRC. Dr. Koshkin will 
consider dose reduction.  
4. Hallucinations and Psychotic -like Behavior: The following symptoms are associated with 
patients with Parkinson ’s Disease. In the three double -blind, placebo -controlled trials in 
early Parkinson's disease, hallucinations were observed in 9% (35 of 388) of patients 
receiving pramipexole tablets, compared with 2.6% (6 of 235) of patients receiving 
placebo.  
 
Patients  with a major psychotic disorder should ordinarily not be treated with dopamine 
agonists, including pramipexole, because of the risk of exacerbating the psychosis. In 
addition, certain medications used to treat psychosis may exacerbate the symptoms of 
Parkinson’s disease and may decrease the effectiveness of pramipexole. If a subject 
experiences hallucinations while taking pramipexole, pramipexole will be discontinued or 
reduced step -wise, pending the dose.  
5. Dyskinesia: May be caused or exacerbated by pramipexole.  
6. Renal impairment: Since pramipexole is eliminated through the kidneys, caution will be 
exercised in the current study.  
7. Rhabdomyolysis, a condition in which the skeletal muscle rapidly breaks down leading to 
muscle pains, weakness, vomiting and confusion. A single case of rhabdomyolysis 
occurred in a 49 -year-old male with advanced Parkinson's disease treated with 
Pramipexole tablets. The patient was hospitalized. The symptoms resolved with 
discontinuation of the medication.  
8. Events reported  with dopaminergic therapy: Include hyperpyrexia and  confusion, fibrotic 
complications, and melanoma.  
 
Most common adverse reactions (incidence >5% and greater than placebo):  
1. Early PD without levodopa: nausea, dizziness, somnolence, insomnia,  constipati on, 
asthenia, and hallucinations.  
Non-opioid pramipexole suppresses immune NLRP3 reactivity for pain   
 Page 21 of 42 Version Date : August 8, 2019  2. Advanced PD with levodopa: postural (orthostatic) hypotension,  dyskinesia, 
extrapyramidal syndrome, insomnia, dizziness,  hallucinations, accidental injury, dream 
abnormalities, confusion,  constipation, asthenia, somnole nce, dystonia, gait abnormality,  
hypertonia, dry mouth, amnesia, and urin ary frequency.  
3.  RLS: nausea, so mnolence, fatigue, and headache  
 
In the event of an adverse event, the HRRC will be notified. An adverse event case report 
from will be completed. The CRC will notify  Dr. Koshkin and Dr. Milligan  as well as the 
appropriate personnel in the HRRC . It is important to note that a standardized form will 
be used for adverse event reporting. The form will ask the following questions:  
1.Have you experienced an y unusual events since you were last seen here?  If yes, the 
CRC will probe further and ask:  
2.What exactly did you experience?  
3.  Did you seek treatment for  this experience ?  
4. Were you given any medications. What was the dose and date started?  Are you s till 
taking this medication? If no, when did you stop taking this medications?  
and should specifically  
5. Have you been feeling dizzy and have you experienced any falls?  
 
In addition, the opinion of Dr. Koshkin will note on the  adverse event case report f rom if 
this adverse event was associated with the study drug, pramipexole.  
 
15. Withdrawal of Subjects  
Anticipated  circumstances where  subjects may be withdrawn from the research 
without their consent  may be if their pain scores worsen for longer than a week .  
In the event of early withdrawal, patients will be tapered from 0.5  (if currently taking that 
dosage)  to 0.250 for 1 week. However, according to the manufacturer’s (Boehringer 
Ingelheim, Inc) packet information, pramipexole at doses of up to 0.75 once dai ly can be 
discontinued without taper.  
 
While t here are no contraindications associated with pramipexole , the collection and 
reporting of adverse are as follows:  
The collection and reporting of adverse events will occur at: (1) the time of the phone 
convers ation at the end of weeks 1 and 3 with the CRC who will collect the Brief Pain 
Inventory scores, (2) at the end of week 2, the time of the mid -term in -person meeting 
with the CRC when the subject will provide the scores of the BPI for that week and will 
pick up drug dispense #2, (3) At the final in -person with the CRC, at the termination of 
the study at week 4, and (4) at any point during the study when the subject calls the CRC 
to report an adverse event or when the subject calls Dr. Koshkin. All adverse e vents will 
be recorded by the CRC and kept with the subject’s study records.  
 
See actions upon evidence of s ymptomatic orthostatic hypotension  above (Section 14, 
“Provisions to monitor the data to ensure the safety of subjects” ), and other adverse 
Non-opioid pramipexole suppresses immune NLRP3 reactivity for pain   
 Page 22 of 42 Version Date : August 8, 2019  reaction s will be monitored during dose escalation during weeks 1 -2, as well as 
throughout the 4 -week study. Monitored will occur as detailed in “Collection and 
Reporting of Adverse Events”.  
 
16.  Data Management /Confidentiality  
16.4. Data will be shared  only among the stu dy team members. Data will not be 
shared to an external source.  
16.5. To minimize potential breach of confidentiality, all electronic data will be 
maintained in a password -protected database to which only CTSC study staff 
with a legitimate need will have access.  All paper documentation will be kept in 
a secure file cabinet in a locked office in the CTSC or in Drs. Milligan or 
Petersen ’s office at UNMH .  
17.  Data and Specimen Banking  
Blood samples will be banked locally only for the study period. All unused blood 
samples will be destroyed at the termination data of the study, which is 1 year after 
the study period begins . 
 
Potential Risks  
 
This study includes multiple elements designed to reduce the risk for the subject. For 
example, the lowest recommended dose for th e study drug, Pramipexole is being 
used, with a careful monitoring of escalating dosages if needed to achieve pain 
suppression. Potential research risks to the subjects in this study include those 
associated with answering questions on the Brief Pain Inven tory and blood draws 
(conducted twice; once at the initiation of the study and at the termination of the 
study).  
 
1. Discomfort Answering Questionnaires: The subject may feel uncomfortable 
answering questions regarding their symptoms and quality of life, or m ay feel 
encumbered by the number of questions asked in the survey instrument. The 
number and content of the questions to be included have been carefully 
considered in order to minimize subject burden.  
2. Blood Draws: Subjects may suffer pain, discomfort, or b ruising from the daily 
blood draws.  
3. Pediatric Use: Subject under 18 years will be excluded  
4. Geriatric Use: Pramipexole total oral clearance is approximately 30% lower in 
subjects older than 65 years compared with younger subjects, because of a decline 
in pramipexole renal clearance due to an age -related reduction in renal function. 
The resultant increase in elimination half -life from approximately 8.5 hours to 12 
hours. In clinical studies with Restless Legs Syndrome patients, 22% of patients 
were at least 6 5 years old, and no apparent differences in efficacy or safety 
between older and younger patients was observed.  
5. Renal Impairment: Patients with renal impairment will be excluded.  
Non-opioid pramipexole suppresses immune NLRP3 reactivity for pain   
 Page 23 of 42 Version Date : August 8, 2019   
Pramipexole (a.k.a. Mirapex) vs. Placebo: will be taken orally by capsule ( 2-3 hours 
before bedtime, with an initial starting dose of 0.125 mg /day for 1 week, and 
increased to 0.25 mg/day beginning the second week if pain relief remains 
suboptimal. Maximal doses of up to 0. 75 mg/day for weeks 3 and/or 4 will be taken 
as needed t o achieve maximal pain relief.  The recommended doses and titration steps 
are derived from the manufacturer (Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc) for 
treating Restless Legs Syndrome. Pramipexole is predicted to be well tolerated in the 
current pilot study because the dose range is much lower (by 60%) than documented 
doses noted as well -tolerated (1.5 to 4.5 mg/day).  
 
Adverse reactions occur at doses greater than 0. 75 mg/day. However, the following 
precautions will be discussed: patients may have the p otential to develop drowsiness 
and an increased risk for somnolence with Pramipexole tablets may occur when also 
using sedating medications or alcohol, or if there is the presence of sleep disorders.  
 
Drug Interactions: Dopamine antagonist drugs may dimin ish the effect of  
pramipexole.  
Contraindication: None.  
 
 
 
18. Potential Benefits to Subjects  
Potential Benefits of the Proposed Research to Human Subjects and Others  
There is potential direct benefit of the proposed research to the study subjects. The 
benefit may come from the treatment of pramipexole for improving pain conditions. 
The benefit to others will be a possible new approach using a non -opioid drug 
‘repurposed’ for the treatment of chronic neuropathic pain. Further, the application of 
pramipexole for pain treatment has the potential of rapid clinical application because 
the compound is FDA -approved with a very good safety profile.  
 
19. Recruitment Methods  
Recruitment of Subjects  
Subjects who qualify for inclusion will be recruited for the study. Potential  subjects 
will be identified by Dr. Koshkin who are experiencing pain with suboptimal pain relief 
by standard pain treatment. A randomization table for all subjects receiving 
pramipexole vs. placebo will be generated such that the Clinical Research 
Coordin ator will use as a template when dispensing drug at the time of consent.  
 
20. Provisions to Protect the Privacy Interests of Subjects  
 
Confidentiality of Subjects  
Subjects will be assigned a study ID number. Linkage to name and other personal 
identifying infor mation  will be kept in a password -protected master database of enrolled 
subjects that will include subject name,  date of birth, address, telephone numbers, 
race/ethnicity. The Brief Pain Inventory survey and records will be kept in a locked 
cabinet in a se cure room by the CTSC Clinical Research Coordinator and will be 
Non-opioid pramipexole suppresses immune NLRP3 reactivity for pain   
 Page 24 of 42 Version Date : August 8, 2019  accessible only to study staff. The computerized study database will only be accessible 
to study personnel using a password -protected system. For this study, we will utilize 
REDCap Survey, a s ecure, password protected data collection and management tool 
hosted by UNM’s CTSC. Patients will use a study ID number to complete the electronic 
surveys to further ensure patient confidentiality. No personal identifying information will 
be used in data a nalysis or study reports. Subjects will sign also sign a HIPAA 
authorization as part of the informed consent process.  
 
21. Economic Burden to Subjects  
The anticipated burden to subjects will be transportation to the CTSC to visit 
the CTSC Clinical Research Coo rdinator at mid -term and the termination of the 
study. No study -related burden is anticipated upon consent and initiation, as the 
subject will be seeing Dr. Koshkin at the UNMH Pain Clinic at a self -initiated 
doctor’s visit.

22. Compensation  
Subjects will be compensated for th eir participation in the study via a ClinCard 
provided to the subject by the Clinical Research Coordinator. Subjects will be 
compensated $15/visit to a total of 3 visits. We predict each visit will be 
approximately 1hr on the first visit, a 30 min for the following two visits to ask 
Non-opioid pramipexole suppresses immune NLRP3 reactivity for pain   
 Page 25 of 42 Version Date : August 8, 2019  questions if any, provide a completed Brief Pain Inventory Survey  and blood draw at 
the initiation and termination. We do not consider the amount of time that each 
subject is devoting to the study a full compensation of their e ffort. However, the 
compensation amount is considered to be an expression of appreciation of their 
participation.  
 
23.  Compensation for Research -Related Injury

27. Sharing Study Progress or Results with Subjects  
27.4. The design of the study will not all ow for results to be shared with the subjects 
during the course of study . In addition, all of the blood samples will not be 
analyzed until after all subjects have completed the study. A summary of the 
study results will be disclosed at the study terminatio n (end of month 12) via 
written communication and a copy of the manuscript submitted for peer review 
in a science journal.   
27.5. Inclusion of Vulnerable Populations  
27.5.1.1.  It is not anticipated that the research will involve subjects who are 
unduly susceptible to coe rcion other than the desire to achieve full pain 
relief. All of the subjects will review and will provide assurance that 
they fully understand the risks and benefits of participation, and can 
change their mind at any point during the study.  
27.5.2.  The research  may include students or employees, which the CTSC 
Clinical Research Coordinator will ensure that the study is entirely 
voluntary and confidential, and will not impact expectations and 
ongoing work at UNMH.  
27.5.3.   The research  may includ e economically disadvantaged  persons , which 
the CTSC Clinical Research Coordinator will ensure  that the study is 
entirely voluntary and will not impact the ongoing treatment that is 
being received from the UNMH Pain Clinic.  
27.5.4.  The research  may include educationally disadvantaged person s, for 
which the CTSC Clinical Research Coordinator will ensure that the 
Consent form will be read aloud, stopping to ask if there are questions.

28.4.1.  Describe involvement of the community in the design and conduct of the 
research.   Members of the communi ty will  not be part of the study in the 
capacity  of fulfill ing key research responsibilities . 
29. Research Involving American Indian/Native Populations  
29.4. Because all subjects will be recruited from the UNMH  Pain Clinic based on 
voluntar y appointment and treatmen t by Dr. Koshkin for  a routine appointment, 
and the nature of the Brief Pain Inventory , the subject participation is not 
intrusive nor probing sensitive cultural issues related to American Indian/Native 
Populations. However, we do plan to enroll a balanced  cultural/racial population 
that attempts to capture the populations in New Mexico.  
 
30. Transnational Research  
Transnational research is not being conducted in this study.  
 
31. Drugs or Devices  
 
Pramipexole of placebo capsules will be dispensed from the UNMH Cli nical Research 
Pharmacy and utilizing a randomization table to guide drug condition to each subject. 
Capsules can be stored at room temperature.  
 
Consenting randomized patients will receive either oral pramipexole to be added to 
ongoing routine treatment f or chronic pain, or placebo with routine treatment.  Oral 
pramipexole will be administered in capsule once daily dose starting with 0.125 (mg), 
and titrating as needed to 0.25 mg by end  of week 1 and /or week  2, and further titrating 
up to 0. 75 mg if neede d for weeks 3 -4. This is the entry -level dose for Restless Legs 
Syndrome without kidney issues.

Pramipexole has a relatively benign side effect profile.   Chronic pain, conversely, 
presents substantial challenges to affected patients’ quality of life.   If it proves effecti ve 
as an adjunct to more routine chronic pain therapy, it will mitigate suffering and 
potentially permit dosage reduction for other medications (e.g. opioids) with more serious 
side effects.   Laboratory evidence indicates that it may also mitigate the unin tended 
hyperalgesic and neuroimmune inflammatory consequences of prolonged opioid 
treatment, which paradoxically exacerbate pain.   This knowledge would be of great 
importance in the field of chronic pain treatment.  
 
Adverse reactions occur at doses greater  than 0.5 mg/day . However, the following 
precautions will be discussed: patients may have the potential to develop drowsiness and 
an increased risk for somnolence with Pramipexole tablets when also using sedating 
medications or alcohol, or if there is the presence of sleep disorders. Fatigue and/or 
headache may also occur.  
 
Drug Interactions: Dopamine antagonist drugs may diminish the effect of pramipexole.  
Contraindication: None.

5. Verify that  each of t he following are true  or provide an alternate justification  
for the underlined regulatory criteria : 
a) The activity involves no more than m inimal risk to the subjects  
because the records review itself is non -invasive and the results of the 
records review will not be used for any purposes other than those 
described above.  
 True  
 Other justification:       
b) The waiver or alteration will not adversely affect the rights and 
welfare of the subjects  because eligible subjects will be approached for 
consent to participate in the research and are free to decline.  Further, 
the information accessed during the records review will not be 
disclosed to anyone without a legitimate purpose (e.g., verification of 
eligibility).  
 True

alteration  because there is no other reasonably efficient and effective 
way to identify who to approach for possible participation in the 
research .   
 True  
 Other justification:       
d) Whenever appr opriate, potentially eligible subjects will be presented 
with information about the research and asked to consider 
participation.   (Regulatory criteria: Whenever appropriate, the 
subjects will be provided with additional pertinent information after 
partici pation .) 
 True  
 Other justification:       
Partial Waiver of HIPAA Authorization for Screening/Recruitment  
Complete the following  additional questions /attestations  if the records you will 
review to identify potential subjects and/or determine eligibility include Protected 
Health Information (PHI).  
6. Will you be recording any PHI when conducting the records review to identify 
potential subjects and/or determine eligibility?  
 Yes. Describe:       
 No 
7. If you answered “Yes” to question 6 above, please  describe when you will 
destroy identifiers (must be the earliest opportunity consistent with the 
conduct of the research) or provide justification for why they must be 
retained:  
      
8. The PHI accessed or recorded for identification/screening  purposes will not be 
reused or disclosed to (shared with) any other person or entity, except as 
required by law, for authorized oversight of the research study, or for other 
research for which the use or disclosure of the PHI would be permitted under 
the Privacy Rule.

 Page 32 of 42 Version Date : August 8, 2019  B. Waiver of Documentation of Consent  
Complete this checklist if you intend to obtain consent verbally but will not be 
obtaining signatures from subjects on a consent form to document consent.  Waiv ers 
of documentation of consent are commonly requested when using scripts, information 
sheets, or email or survey introductions to present the elements of consent instead of 
using a traditional consent form.  
1. Are you requesting a waiver of documentation of consent for some or all 
subjects?  
 All 
 Some. Explain:       
2. Provide justification for one of the following:  
a) That the only record linking the subject and the research would be the 
consent document and the principal risk would be potential harm 
resulting from a breach of confidentiality. Each subject will be a sked 
whether the subject wants documentation linking the subject with the 
research, and the subject's wishes will govern.  
      
b) That the research presents no more than minimal risk of harm to 
subjects and involves no procedures for which writ ten consent is 
normally required outside of the research context.  
      
3. Do you intend to provide subjects with a written statement regarding the 
research  in lieu of a traditional consent form?  
 Yes. Please attach a copy to yo ur submission in Click.  
 No 
C. Alteration of Consent  
Complete this checklist if you intend to obtain consent but will be eliminating or 
altering one or more of the required elements of consent. Alterations of consent are 
commonly requested fo r research involving deception or for minimal risk research 
when an abbreviated consent is desired and one or more of the required element are 
not relevant to the research.  
Note: FDA -regulated research is not eligible for an alteration of consent.  
1. Which el ement(s) of consent do you wish to eliminate and why?

alteration:  
      
d) Whenever appropriate, the subjects will be provided with additional 
pertinent information after participation:  
      
D. Full Waiver of Consent /Parental Permission  
Complete this checklist if you are requesting a full waiver of consent fo r all subjects 
or certain subject groups (e.g., retrospective cohort).  Full waivers of consent are 
commonly requested when the research does not include any opportunity for 
interaction with subjects (e.g., chart review).  
Note: FDA -regulated research is no t eligible for a full waiver of consent using these 
criteria.  If you believe that your FDA -regulated research may be eligible for a waiver 
under another mechanism, such as planned emergency research, contact the HRPO 
for assistance in determining what inf ormation to provide to the HRRC.  
1. Are you requesti ng a waiver  for some or all subjects?  
 All 
 Some. Explain:       
2. Provide justification for each of the following regulatory criteria:  
a) The research involves no more than minimal risk to the subjects:  
      
b) The waiver or alteration will not adversely affect the rights and 
welfare of the subjects:  
      
Non-opioid pramipexole suppresses immune NLRP3 reactivity for pain

would be accepted by nonprisoner  volunteers  
      
c) Procedures for the selection of subjects within the prison are fair to all 
prisoners and immune from arbitrary interv ention by prison authorities 
or prisoners. U nless justification is provided , control subjects must be 
selected randomly from the group of available prisoners who meet the 
characteristics needed for that particular research project

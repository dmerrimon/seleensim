CIP 12 -018-10, Version Date 01 March 2018  1.0 Clinical Investigation Plan Overview  
The commercially available Günther Tulip® and Cook Celect® inferior vena cava filters 
have been previously evaluated in clinical studies.1-3  This prospective, multicenter, 
single -arm clinical study will further evaluate the safety and effectiveness of Cook’s 
permanent and retrievable inferior vena cava (IVC) fil ters (specifically, the Günther 
Tulip® and the Cook Celect® filters) in patients in need of temporary or permanent IVC 
filter placement for the prevention of pulmonary embolism (PE).  This study will enroll 
320 patients in the Celect® filter stratum and up  to 150 patients in the Günther Tulip® 
stratum at up to 40 clinical sites globally ; patients  will be stratified based upon the type of 
filter they receive.  Consistent with current clinical practice and already -completed 
studies of Cook’s IVC filters, the study will evaluate the performance and safety of filters 
in patients considered at risk for PE for a variety of clinical reasons (i.e., a broad patient 
population).   
 
Study assessments will include, but are not limited to: rate of technical placement 
success, rate of freedom from new symptomatic PE, rate of freedom from new PE, rate of 
clinical perforation, rate of migration, rate of filter fracture, rate of filter embolization, 
rate of IVC thrombotic occlusion, rate of new symptomatic deep vein thrombosi s (DVT; 
total incidence and new incidence), rate of procedure -related complications, time to filter 
retrieval, number of successful retrievals, and rate of technical retrieval success.   
 
Patients will be followed until 1 month after successful filter retr ieval or until study 
completion 2 years after filter placement.  Enrollment is expected to be completed within 
2 years of initiating the study.  The primary study endpoints for the Celect® filter stratum 
will be compared to performance goals for safety (i. e., freedom from major adverse 
events) and effectiveness (i.e., technical placement success and freedom from new 
symptomatic PE while a filter is indwelling).  Additional study outcomes will be 
evaluated separately for each stratum (i.e., separately for pa tients receiving the Günther 
Tulip® and Celect® filters) and for the combined patient set.  The study flow diagrams are 
presented in Figure 1.1 (filter placement and follow -up) and Figure 1.2 (filter retrieval 
and follow -up).

2.0 Objective of the Clinical Study  
The objectives of this study are to further evaluate the safety and effectiveness of Cook’s 
commercially available IVC filters (specifically, the Günther Tulip® filter and the Co ok 
Celect® filters) in patients in need of temporary or permanent IVC filter placement for the 
prevention of PE.  This study is intended to address FDA’s concerns related to IVC 
filters.4 
3.0 Device Description and Intended Use  
3.1 General Device Descripti on 
All Cook vena cava filter sets include an IVC filter intended for prevention of recurrent 
PE in specific situations, such as chronic, recurrent PE where anticoagulant therapy has 
failed or is contraindicated.  All Cook vena cava filter sets are availabl e in a femoral vein 
access version, with which the filter is introduced through the femoral vein, a jugular vein 
access version, with which the filter is introduced through the jugular vein, and a 
universal vein access version, which includes the component s for both femoral and 
jugular vein approaches.  Each filter set consists of a preloaded filter, a coaxial introducer 
sheath system with a Check -Flo® valve, a hydrophilically coated pre -dilator, and a three -
way stopcock.   
The jugular and femoral vein access versions of all filters are available with the NavAlign 
introducer system (K090140), with design improvements to the introducer sheath and 
filter introducer intended to ease the filter placement procedure and reduce the likelihood 
of procedure -related complications.  
Pre-retrieval assessment: X -raya (2-view device) and venacavagram  
IVC filter retrieval and post -retrieval venacavagram  
1-month post -retrieval follow -up: clinical assessment and assessment of medications, 
hospitalizations, and medical conditions  
Cook Research Incorporated  Page 12 of 56 
IVC Filter Study   
 
COMPANY CONFIDENTIAL  
CIP 12 -018-10, Version Date 01 March 2018  The femoral vein access version of all filters is available with a flexible tip (composed of 
flexible stainless steel cable tubing covered with polyether block amide (PEBAX) shrink 
tubing) on the filter introducer, which is intended to ma ke the tip more flexible to 
improve trackability of the introducer through the venous anatomy (K121057).   
The femoral vein access version of the Günther Tulip® filter and the Celect® filter is also 
available with added markers along the introducer sheath to improve visibility on 
procedural imaging (K112119).  In this set, the femoral introducer sheath is made of 
polyethylene (as compared to fluorinated ethylene propylene, which is the material 
component of the femoral introducer sheath for all other femora l vein access sets) and has 
an attached clip (composed of stainless steel spring wire with polycarbonate, 
acrylonitrile/butadiene/styrene (PC -ABS) handle) to mark the position of the sheath at the 
insertion site.  
The Celect® filter is available with added platinum markers on its primary legs to 
improve visibility on procedural imaging (K121629).  The femoral vein access version of 
the Celect® with platinum markers on its primary legs is only available with a flexible tip, 
and is not available with markers a long its introducer sheath.  
Please reference the manufacturer’s Instructions for Use (IFU) for a complete description 
of each of these devices.  
3.2 Indication for Use  
The Günther Tulip® filter and the Cook Celect® filters are intended for the prevention o f 
recurrent PE via placement in the vena cava in the following situations:  
 
• Pulmonary thromboembolism when anticoagulant therapy is contraindicated;  
• Failure of anticoagulant therapy in thromboembolic diseases;  
• Emergency treatment following massive PE wher e anticipated benefits of 
conventional therapy are reduced; and  
• Chronic, recurrent PE where anticoagulant therapy has failed or is 
contraindicated.  
 
In addition to the specific labeled indications, it is well -documented in clinical practice 
guidelines that  IVC filters have additional clinical indications, and are frequently placed 
in patients with the following: severe trauma, closed head trauma, spinal cord injury, 
Cook Research Incorporated  Page 13 of 56 
IVC Filter Study   
 
COMPANY CONFIDENTIAL  
CIP 12 -018-10, Version Date 01 March 2018  multiple long -bone or pelvic fractures, or other conditions putting them at high risk for 
PE (e.g., prolonged immobilization, pre -/post -operatively).5-8  Outcomes from use in 
these broad patient populations have been widely reported in the literature1-3,9-22, 
including those based on results of previous studies for the Cook IVC filters.1-3  Based  on 
available data, patient outcome is not specifically related to indication for filter 
placement, but may be related to each patient’s overall medical condition, including the 
patient’s state of hypercoagulability, body mass index, use of anticoagulation , comorbid 
conditions, etc.  Moreover, Cook has conducted three previous studies of the performance 
of its permanent and retrievable IVC filters in a broad patient population,1-3 and the 
results (or interim results) of these studies are included in product labeling.  Furthermore, 
these broad patient populations were included in the indications for use that were 
approved in the PMA for the Cook Bird’s Nest® Vena Cava Filter (P85004 9). 
3.3 Device Identification and Tracking  
As commercially available devices, the Cook IVC filters will be obtained by each site 
through normal commercial procurement methods and stored and accounted for 
following site -specific policies.  Lot numbers for devices used in study patients will be 
recorded on the appropriate Case Report Forms (CRFs).  
3.4 Instructions for Use   
The manufacturer’s IFU for each filter contains the following information:  
 
• Complete instructions including storage and handling require ments, preparation 
for use, pre -use checks, precautions to be taken after use, and disposal.  
• Complete summary of the necessary training and experience required for use of 
these devices.  
• Complete description of the procedures involved in the use of these d evices.  
4.0 Literature Review  
Background  
Venous thromboembolism (VTE) affects nearly 1,000,000 people in the US each year, 
and includes both DVT and PE.  Pulmonary emboli commonly result from DVT.  PE is a 
major cause of morbidity and mortality in the US, with estimates of 400,000 – 630,000 
nonfatal PEs and 50,000 – 200,000 fatal PEs per year.8  Populations at an increased risk 
Cook Research Incorporated  Page 14 of 56 
IVC Filter Study   
 
COMPANY CONFIDENTIAL  
CIP 12 -018-10, Version Date 01 March 2018  for VTE include those with an inherited hypercoagulability, those undergoing complex 
surgery (including orthopedic surgery and bari atric surgery, among others), those with 
cancer, those with trauma, those with prolonged immobilization, those with a previous 
episode of VTE, as well as those patients with acute medical situations such as stroke, 
heart failure, respiratory failure, or in fections.  The typical prevention method for VTE is 
anticoagulation therapy (e.g., heparin, warfarin).  However, anticoagulation may be 
contraindicated in some patients; for instance, those undergoing complex surgery, those 
with acute or recent bleeding, t hose with liver disease, and those with trauma.  Therefore, 
IVC filter placement via percutaneous access is frequently utilized to mitigate the 
potential risk of PE, either as an individual prevention modality or in combination with 
anticoagulation therapy .   
IVC filter placement is a well -established method for PE prophylaxis.  The first IVC 
filter was introduced in the late 1960s as an alternative to surgical ligation, caval 
plication, and clips.  The early filters (Mobin -Uddin Umbrella and Greenfield) re quired 
surgical cut -down for placement; Cook’s Bird’s Nest® Filter was the first percutaneously 
placed filter, and was approved under a PMA with expert advisory panel review.  All 
early filters (Mobin -Uddin Umbrella, Greenfield, Bird’s Nest®) were intended  for 
permanent placement, i.e., the filters could not be retrieved after placement.  Filter 
technology has evolved to include a variety of percutaneously placed retrievable filters, 
which were initially developed in response to the following clinical obser vations: 1) a 
need for temporary periods of PE prophylaxis and 2) potential complications of 
permanently indwelling filters.  Retrievable filters may be retrieved or left as permanent 
devices; treatment is at the discretion of the physician, with specific considerations to the 
individual medical condition of each patient.  Cook’s Günther Tulip® filter has the 
longest history of permanent and retrievable use in the US, and Cook’s Celect® filter has 
also been used as a permanent and retrievable filter for man y years.   
Despite the clinical rationale for the development of retrievable filters, in particular in 
periods of temporary high risk for PE (which includes patients with trauma and those in 
the perioperative setting, among others), the labeled filter indi cations do not adequately 
reflect use in the clinical studies performed to date or in routine clinical practice.  It 
should be noted that the expert panel recommended approval of the Bird’s Nest® for use 
in a broad population of patients considered at risk  for PE, reflective of the clinical data 
supporting the filter and more appropriate than the current labeled indication (the 
indications were changed following a 1995 letter from FDA mandating that the product 
Cook Research Incorporated  Page 15 of 56 
IVC Filter Study   
 
COMPANY CONFIDENTIAL  
CIP 12 -018-10, Version Date 01 March 2018  indications for use be modified).  It is well -documented in clinical practice guidelines that 
IVC filter placement is widely utilized for both patients with proven VTE and patients 
without proven VTE but considered at high risk for VTE.5-8  Patients with VTE receive 
filters because 1) they are at high  risk for PE and have a contraindication to or 
complication or failure of anticoagulation therapy or 2) they are at high risk for PE 
despite anticoagulation therapy, have increased risks of complications with 
anticoagulation therapy, or are noncompliant wi th anticoagulation therapy.  Patients 
without proven VTE receive filters when they are considered at risk for developing VTE 
and cannot receive effective prophylaxis or be monitored for the development of VTE 
(e.g., trauma patients, patients undergoing cer tain surgical procedures).  In each category, 
filters provide prophylactic protection against the occurrence of PE.  
Filter Efficacy  
Two randomized studies on the efficacy of IVC filters have been performed.  In the first, 
Decousus et al. randomized 400 pat ients with proximal DVT to permanent filter 
placement or no filter (patients were also assigned to two different anticoagulation 
regimens) and found that the filter group had significantly fewer events of PE ( p=0.008), 
albeit more events of DVT ( p=0.042) t hrough 8 years.23,24  Specifically, the eight -year PE 
rates were 15.1% in the no filter group and 6.2% in the filter group.  More recently, 
Rajasekhar et al. randomized 34 trauma patients to retrievable filter (Celect®) placement 
or no filter and observed one PE in the no filter group and no PE in the filter group 
through 6 months.25  Thus, the randomized data available suggest that filters do provide 
protection against PE, as intended.  
In addition to these data, a wide body of clinical literature supports filter efficacy in a 
broad range of patient populations.  These include data from primarily single and 
multicenter studies of individual filter types, and some randomized studies comparing 
outcomes with different filter types.  Based on Cook’s ongoing anal ysis of the published 
literature, IVC filter use in a broad patient population is associated with a low PE rate (an 
average of 1.7%).2,3,11 -13,19,21,23 -41  This rate is much lower than that observed in the 
PREPIC study; moreover, this rate is lower than th e expected PE rate in specific patient 
populations (for example, a literature review suggests that the PE rate in trauma patients 
without an IVC filter is approximately 4.9%).  In general, the data are supportive of the 
use of filters to prevent PE, though  there are important covariates that may impact patient 
outcomes (e.g., history of VTE, anticoagulation scheme).   
Cook Research Incorporated  Page 16 of 56 
IVC Filter Study   
 
COMPANY CONFIDENTIAL  
CIP 12 -018-10, Version Date 01 March 2018  The benefit of filter placement in specific patient populations has also been discussed in 
the literature, including:  
• A recent systematic rev iew of 24 studies describing filter placement in trauma 
patients, in which the authors concluded that (for the trauma population) filter -
related complications are infrequent (and those that do occur tend not to be 
clinically -significant) and that filter pl acement does reduce the incidence of PE 
and PE -related mortality.42 
• A recent assessment of the impact of IVC filters on in -hospital fatality due to PE 
based on the Nationwide Inpatient Sample using ICD -9-CM codes to identify 
patients with PE.  Results of t he analysis suggested that IVC filter placement 
resulted in significantly fewer in -hospital fatalities in: 1) unstable patients with PE 
(regardless of the use of thrombolytic therapy; 33% vs. 51% in patients without 
thrombolytic therapy and 7.6% vs. 18% in  patients with thrombolytic therapy; 
p<0.0001); and 2) stable patients receiving thrombolytic therapy (6.4% vs. 15%; 
p<0.0001).  The incidence of in -hospital fatality in stable patients not receiving 
thrombolytic therapy was also significantly reduced (7.2 % vs. 7.9%; p<0.0001), 
though this reduction was not as clinically -meaningful as for the other 
populations.43 
Therefore, the clinical body of evidence supports filter placement for the prevention of 
PE in a broad range of patients.  
Filter Safety  
As with an y medical implant, IVC filters are associated with a range of potential adverse 
events; these events are clearly outlined in Cook’s IFUs for its IVC filters.  Recent 
clinical practice guidelines report the incidence of adverse events for IVC filters in 
general to be as follows:7,8  
Cook Research Incorporated  Page 17 of 56 
IVC Filter Study   
 
COMPANY CONFIDENTIAL  
CIP 12 -018-10, Version Date 01 March 2018  Table 4. 1.  Incidence of adverse events for IVC filters as a class  
Adverse Event  Reported Rate  
IVC penetration  0-41% 
Clinically -significant penetration  0.4%  
Filter migration  0-18% 
Filter fracture  2-10% 
Recurrent PE  0.5-6% 
Access site thrombus  0-25% 
IVC occlusion  2-30% 
Insertion problems  5-23% 
 
These event rates are derived from events reported in the clinical literature, and are based 
on studies for various types of IVC filters and with a wide range of sample sizes (which 
directly impacts the reported event rates).  Moreover, definitions for the  events vary 
among publications; in particular, they include both those that are clinically -significant 
(i.e., those associated with patient symptoms and/or requiring an intervention) and those 
without clinical consequences.  Therefore, the data should be interpreted carefully.  
In 2010, FDA issued a public notice in which it expressed concerns related specifically to 
the number of adverse event reports for filter migration, filter embolization, filter 
fracture, and perforation of the IVC;4 notably, event r ates cannot be deduced from the 
FDA database of reported events.  In light of these concerns, FDA recommended that 
filter retrieval be considered as soon as the mechanical protection against PE is no longer 
warranted.  FDA’s recommendation is consistent wi th literature reports which suggest 
that patients may be at increased risk of adverse events when filters are left indwelling for 
extended periods of time; despite the fact that most filters are retrievable, a large 
percentage are left in place permanently .  Several publications have documented the fact 
that dedicated patient follow -up, with recurring assessment for continued risk of PE, 
results in increased rates of filter retrieval.44-47  These same authors postulate that 
increased filter retrieval rates may correlate to reduced incidence of filter complications.  
This hypothesis has yet to be verified in clinical studies, but some filter practices (both 
filter placement decisions and clinical follow -up practices) have changed in light of these 
safety conc erns.  
Recently, the SVS/SIR physician working group presented what they consider to be the 
clinically -acceptable 1 -year event rates for filter -related safety and effectiveness 
Cook Research Incorporated  Page 18 of 56

comparison to the rates in Tables 4.1 and 4.2.  Finally, these rates were utilized in the 
development of the performance goals and sample size for this study (described in further 
detail in Sections 8.1 and 8.3).

Cook’s IVC Filter Data  
Cook Incorporated has sponsored three prospective, multi -center, single arm clinical 
studies of Cook IVC filters that are currently marketed in the US.  Briefly, these include 
the IDE study of 41 US patients treated with the Günther Tulip® filter ( G000242; results 
of which supported a retrievable indication, cleared in K032426 ), a second study of 554 
US patients treated with the commer cially available Günther Tulip® filter, and a study of 
129 OUS patients treated with the Celect® filter (interim results of which supported 
permanent and retrievable indications).  Results from all three studies have been 
published in peer -reviewed journal s. 1-3  
All three studies evaluated filter safety and effectiveness (outcome measures similar to 
those listed in Tables 4.1 and 4.2) in patients at risk for developing a PE; as such, a 
variety of reasons for filter placement are captured in the studies.  Approxima tely half of 
the filter placements in these studies were associated with bariatric procedures or trauma 
cases; specifically, 28/41 patients (68.3%) in the IDE Günther Tulip® study, 329/554 
patients (59.4%) in the second Günther Tulip® study, and 53/129 pat ients (41.1%) in the

CIP 12 -018-10, Version Date 01 March 2018  Celect® study received filters for these types of indications.  Mean follow -up duration 
(with range in parentheses) was 70.4 ± 49.3 (0 -160) days for the IDE Günther Tulip® 
study, 124 ± 75.3 (3 -494) days in the second Günther Tulip® study, and 277 ± 146 (1 -
602) days in the Celect® study (note: the Celect® study included an arm specifically 
intended to assess permanent filters).  Mean filter indwell times (for retrieved filters) 
were 11.0 days in the IDE Günther Tulip® study, 58.9 days in  the second Günther Tulip® 
study, and 179 days in the retrieval arm of the Celect® study.   
The significant safety findings (including PE and those AEs associated with the safety 
endpoint specified in this clinical investigation plan) in each study are sum marized as 
follows.  In the Günther Tulip® IDE study, events included one filter misplacement and 
migration requiring immediate retrieval and placement of a new filter, one filter 
migration to the right atrium (with successful retrieval), one PE, one patie nt with a caval 
thrombosis/occlusion, and four deaths (none were device related); in addition, one patient 
had a vena cava injury following the retrieval procedure (with a normal 3 -month post -
retrieval follow -up examination).  Events in the second Günther Tulip® study included 
five PEs, one DVT, one filter fracture noted at retrieval, one vascular access site 
complication following filter implant, and 13 deaths (two were related to PE and six were 
within 30 days of filter placement).  In the Celect® study, related events included two 
PEs, one DVT, one migration (without clinical sequelae), and 26 deaths (one associated 
with a PE and eight within 30 days of filter placement); there was no difference in the 
type of events observed in the permanent and retrieva ble study arms.  The incidence of 
each type of event observed in Cook’s clinical investigations is on the low end of, or 
below, the rates reported in Tables 4.1 and 4.2 above (Table 4.3).  Moreover, the overall 
rate of events associated with the primary en dpoints of this clinical investigation (i.e., PE, 
placement success, caval thrombosis/occlusion, perforation with clinical sequelae, DVT, 
embolization, fracture, and migration) for the Günther Tulip® filter was 3.7% and the 
overall rate of events for the C elect® filter was 9.3%.

Conclusion  
Many clinical studies have been conducted on IVC filters, including Cook’s studies of its 
Günther Tulip® and Celect® filters; Cook’s study results support the safety and 
effectiveness of its filters.  In light of FDA’s ongoing concerns regarding the use, 
performance, and safety of IVC filters, this study is intended to collect additional safety 
and effectiveness data on  Cook’s IVC filters (i.e., the Günther Tulip® and Celect® filters) 
in patients in need of temporary or permanent IVC filter placement for prevention of PE.  
The study population and endpoints of interest are similar to those investigated in Cook’s 
previous  IVC filter studies, to those of interest in the literature, and to those of interest to 
FDA4 and several physician society groups.49  Results of this study will be provided to 
FDA and may be used to support expanded indications for Cook’s IVC filters, and  may 
also be compared to safety and effectiveness results associated with implantation of other 
filter types to the extent that this protocol is consistent with the PRESERVE study.

CIP 12 -018-10, Version Date 01 March 2018  5.2 Risks and Foreseeable Adverse Events and Adverse Device Effects  
The following foreseeable adverse events, which are captured in the IFUs of these 
commercially available devices, may be considered as potential risks to patients receiving 
a Cook IVC filter:  
• Damage to the vena cava  
• PE 
• Filter embolization (including embolization of fractured components)  
• Vena cava perforation/penetration  
• Vena cava thrombosis or occlusion  
• Hemorrhage  
• Hematoma at vascular access site  
• Infection at vascular access site  
• Cardiac tamponade  
• Filter malpositioning  
• Postphlebitic syndrome  
• Death  
• DVT  
In addition, participation in this clinical study is associated with the risk of additional 
radiation exposure from study imaging requirements that are above and beyond the 
standard of care.   
5.3 Methods to Minimize Risks  
The Cook IVC filters will be use d only by trained healthcare professionals who are 
experienced in the study procedure/treatment.  Patients will be selected in accordance 
with the inclusion/exclusion criteria outlined in this document.  
 
The imaging required as part of this clinical inves tigation has been recommended by 
FDA, in order to provide additional data for interpreting the occurrence of adverse 
events.  The risk of radiation exposure associated with study imaging has been minimized 
by collecting imaging data only where essential fo r the study or otherwise clinically 
indicated or per institutional standard of care.  
The device design, non -clinical testing, clinical study design, and the IFUs are intended 
to minimize the risks associated with the use of these devices.  The risks of the  study

COMPANY CONFIDENTIAL  
CIP 12 -018-10, Version Date 01 March 2018  have been minimized and the potential benefits outweigh the risks in light of the 
importance of the knowledge to be gained about the safety and effectiveness of Cook’s 
IVC filters.  
6.0 Design of the Clinical Study  
6.1 Type/Design of Study  
This prospective, multicenter, single -arm clinical study will further evaluate the safety 
and effectiveness of Cook’s commercially available IVC filters (specifically, the Günther 
Tulip® and the Cook Celect® filters) in patients in need of temporary or permanen t IVC 
filter placement for prevention of PE.  This study will enroll 320 patients in the Celect® 
filter stratum and up to 150 patients in the Günther Tulip® filter stratum  at up to 40 
clinical sites globally.  At least half of the study patients in the Cel ect® filter stratum will 
be enrolled at US sites.  Consistent with current clinical practice, the study is expected to 
evaluate the performance and safety of filters in a broad range of patients considered at 
risk for PE (i.e., in patients considered at ri sk for PE for a variety of clinical reasons).  
This could include patients ranging from those with PE or DVT and a contraindication to, 
complication of, failure of, or poor compliance with anticoagulation to patients without 
evidence of PE or DVT, but cons idered to be at risk for PE for other reasons.   
 
The results of the study will be compared to safety (i.e., freedom from major adverse 
events) and effectiveness (i.e., technical placement success and freedom from new 
symptomatic PE while a filter is indwe lling) performance goals.  
6.2 Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria  
Patient eligibility for enrollment shall be based on known information at the time of the 
procedure.  Information obtained at a later date may contradict these criteria, but this will 
not be co nsidered a violation of the CIP.  
 
Inclusion Criterion  
 
A patient may be suitable for inclusion in the study if he/she requires temporary or 
permanent IVC filter placement for the prevention of PE.

CIP 12 -018-10, Version Date 01 March 2018  6.3 Endpoints  
6.3.1  Primary Effectiveness Endpoint  
The primary effectiveness endpoint is the rate of technical placement success and 12 -
month freedom from new symptomatic PE while a filter is indwelling.  Analysis of the 
primary effectiveness end point will be performed separately for each filter type (i.e., each 
stratum).   
 
Events of symptomatic PE occurring after filter retrieval (i.e., through the 1-month post -
retrieval follow -up period) will be collected; such events will not count against the 
primary effectiveness endpoint, but will be reported as a secondary measure.   
6.3.2  Primary Safety Endpoint  
The primary safety endpoint is the rate of 12 -month freedom from major adverse events.  
Major adverse events are defined as: clinical perforation, clinical migration, clinical 
fracture, embolization of the filter or filter fragments to the heart or lungs, IVC 
thrombotic occlusion, new symptomatic DVT whi le a filter is indwelling, access site 
complications with clinical sequelae, and procedure -/device -related death.  Analysis of 
the primary safety endpoint will be performed separately for each filter type (i.e., each 
stratum).  
 
Events occurring after filter retrieval (i.e., through the 1 -month post -retrieval follow -up 
period) will be collected, but only the events of access site complications with clinical 
sequelae and procedure -related death will count against the primary safety endpoint.  
Other event s (i.e., potentially new DVT without symptoms) will be reported as a 
secondary measure.  
6.3.3  Secondary Endpoints  
The secondary endpoints include:  
• Rate of technical placement success and 12 -month freedom from new 
symptomatic PE while a filter is indwelling  for the combined patient 
population  
• Rate of 12 -month freedom from major adverse events for the combined 
patient population

in the best interest of the patient to forego the ultrasound exam so the filter may be placed immediately and/or in 
which a duplex ultrasound may not be physically possible prior to filter placement (e.g., patients with trauma to 
the pelvis), the venogram may be used to assess for thrombus  in vein segments visualized on the  venogram .  If 
segment(s) of vein are not assessed before the filter is placed, assessment s are to  be completed within  one day

CIP 12 -018-10, Version Date 01 March 2018  6.5 Measures to be Taken to Avoid or Minimize Bias  
This study is designed as a prospective clinical trial to minimize bias in analyzing the 
results.  Specifically, the study will utilize event adjudication by an independent clinical 
events co mmittee and imaging analysis by a centralized core laboratory to minimize bias 
in analyzing the results.  Patients requiring temporary or permanent IVC filter placement 
to prevent PE will be screened consecutively to mitigate selection bias.  Investigation al 
sites will maintain a screening log of patients; for patients who are excluded from the 
study, the log will indicate the primary inclusion/exclusion criterion that is violated.  A 
single institution may enroll up to 20% of the patients in each stratum t o minimize bias 
that may be introduced if the majority of patients are enrolled from one or two large 
clinical sites.  Finally, filter choice will be left to the discretion of the physician.  
7.0 Methods  
7.1 Patient C onsent  
Patients who meet the inclusion c riterion and none of the exclusion criteria will be invited 
to participate in this study.  All patients eligible for entry into the study will have the 
study explained to them, as well as potential risks and benefits of their participation in the 
study.  E ach patient (or legally authorized representative) who agrees to participate will 
be required to sign an informed consent document prior to undergoing study -specific 
testing or the filter placement procedure.  If new information is obtained after a patient  
receives treatment with the device, patients who have not exited the study will be 
informed about the new information, and will be reconsented at the discretion of the 
investigators and/or the sites’ IRBs/ECs/REBs.  
7.2 Point of Enrollment  
Patients will be  considered enrolled in the study once the filter introducer sheath is 
inserted below the skin.  
7.3 Medications  
Patients should receive medication(s) according to the institution’s standard of care 
and/or at the physician’s discretion, based on each patien t’s individual medical condition. 
The use of antiplatelet and anticoagulation medications should be recorded on 
appropriate CRFs.

COMPANY CONFIDENTIAL  
CIP 12 -018-10, Version Date 01 March 2018  7.4 Pre-procedure  
A pre -procedure clinical assessment will be completed (up to 6 weeks prior to the index 
procedure) including  documentation of medical comorbidities and assessment of 
medications.  Duplex ultrasound of the IVC, bilateral iliac veins, and bilateral lower 
extremity veins will be performed; presence of DVT will be documented on the 
appropriate CRF.  For patients in whom a CT with contrast was performed as part of 
routine care within 2  weeks of the filter placement procedure, the CT may be used to 
assess for thrombus in vein segments visualized on CT.  For cases in which a physician 
feels it is in the best interest of  the patient to forego the ultrasound exam so the filter may 
be placed immediately and/or in which a duplex ultrasound may not be physically 
possible prior to filter placement (e.g., patients with trauma to the pelvis), the venogram 
may be used to assess f or thrombus.  If segment(s) of vein are not assessed before the 
filter is placed, assessment s are to  be completed within  one day after the placement 
procedure.  Assessments of all vein segments of interest are to be completed, unless a 
patient’s injuries p revent examination of one or more vein segment(s).   
 
Patients with suspected PE should undergo appropriate assessment for the presence of 
PE, including appropriate imaging (i.e., pulmonary arteriography, cross -sectional 
imaging, or ventilation/perfusion l ung scan), according to the institution’s standard of 
care.  This imaging will be collected and results of these assessments will be documented 
on the appropriate CRF.   
7.5 Filter Placement Procedure  
• Diagnostic imaging will be performed prior to study enr ollment to verify 
anatomical study criteria.     
• Only one Cook IVC filter should be placed in each patient.  The Cook IVC filter 
should be implanted in accordance with the respective IFU (i.e., caudal to the 
renal veins).   
• Completion imaging will be perfo rmed to assess filter position (including tilt) and 
to assess the vena cava for evidence of injury.  
7.6 Post-Filter Placement/Pre -Discharge  
Post-placement care includes observation and discharge according to institutional 
standard of care and completion of  clinical and medication assessments.  In addition, a 2 -
Cook Research Incorporated  Page 30 of 56 
IVC Filter Study   
 
COMPANY CONFIDENTIAL  
CIP 12 -018-10, Version Date 01 March 2018  view device X -ray will be performed prior to hospital discharge; the X -ray should be 
performed in AP and LAT views.  Patients undergoing bedside filter placement in whom 
a 2-view device X -ray could no t be obtained prior to discharge must have a 2 -view 
device X -ray within 45 days  post-placement.  
7.7 Post-Placement Follow -up 
Follow -up windows are intended as guidelines only.  They are not absolute and are not 
intended to limit data collection due to sche duling conflicts.  
 
• 3 Months Post -Placement (90 ± 15 days): Office visit including an assessment of 
the need for continued filtration, and an assessment of medications, 
hospitalizations, and medical conditions.  
 
• 6 Months Post -Placement (180 ± 30 days):   Telephone contact by the clinical site 
to assess hospitalizations and medical conditions.  Up to three attempts should be 
made to contact the patient.  
 
• 12 Months Post -Placement (365 ± 30 days):  Office visit including an assessment 
of the need for continued fi ltration, and an assessment of medications, 
hospitalizations, and medical conditions.  An abdominal CT with contrast to 
assess filter leg interaction with the IVC, a 2 -view device X -ray to assess device 
integrity (the X -ray should be performed in AP and LA T views), and duplex 
ultrasound (IVC, bilateral pelvic veins, and bilateral lower extremity veins) to 
assess thrombus/DVT will be performed.  
 
• 18 Months Post -Placement (540 ± 60 days):   Telephone contact by the clinical 
site to assess hospitalizations and m edical conditions.  Up to three attempts should 
be made to contact the patient.  
 
• 2 Years Post -Placement (730 ± 60 days):  Office visit including an assessment of 
the need for continued filtration, and an assessment of medications, 
hospitalizations, and medi cal conditions.  An abdominal CT with contrast to 
assess filter leg interaction with the IVC will be performed.  
 
Cook Research Incorporated  Page 31 of 56 
IVC Filter Study   
 
COMPANY CONFIDENTIAL  
CIP 12 -018-10, Version Date 01 March 2018  The need for continued filtration will be assessed based on each patient’s overall medical 
condition.  The decision to proceed to a retrieval a ttempt should also be based on factors 
such as the patient’s ability and willingness to undergo the retrieval procedure and the 
physician’s assessment of the risk/benefit ratio associated with the retrieval procedure.  
If at any time during follow -up a pati ent presents with adverse clinical symptoms 
potentially related to his/her indwelling filter or the development of DVT/PE, appropriate 
assessments and treatment should be conducted according to the institution’s standard of 
care.  Clinical and imaging find ings will be documented on the appropriate CRFs.  For 
example:  
• If the physician suspects a vena cava perforation, a n abdominal  CT with contrast 
will be performed  to assess filter leg interaction with the IVC . 
• If the physician suspects DVT, the DVT will be documented by duplex 
ultrasound, contrast venography, CT, or MR venography.  
• If the physician suspects PE, the PE will be documented by pulmonary 
arteriography, cross -sectional imaging (e.g., CT, MRI), or ventilation/perfusion 
lung scan.  
7.8 Filter Retrieva l Procedure  
The Cook IVC filters may be retrieved if clinically indicated.  
 
Before retrieval, the following will be performed:  
• Two-view device X -ray to assess device integrity; X -ray should be performed in 
AP and LAT views; and  
• Venacavagram to assess filter position, presence and extent of thrombus in the 
filter, and IVC wall morphology.  
 
If a 2-view device  X-ray was collected within 30 days prior to retrieval, an additional pre-
retrieval X -ray would not be required.  The venacavagram will be collected  procedurally, 
just prior to filter retrieval.  
Filter retrieval should not be attempted in the instance that significant trapped thrombus 
(i.e., > 25% of the cone volume) is observed in the filter.  Filter retrieval should be 
performed using the Günther T ulip® Retrieval Set and in accordance with the IFU.  
Following retrieval, the IVC will be assessed by venacavagram.  
Cook Research Incorporated  Page 32 of 56 
IVC Filter Study   
 
COMPANY CONFIDENTIAL  
CIP 12 -018-10, Version Date 01 March 2018   
If the filter retrieval attempt is unsuccessful, the patient will continue his/her post -
placement follow -up schedule, indexed to the filter  placement procedure.  Another filter 
retrieval attempt can be made at a later date, depending on the patient’s medical 
condition.  
7.9 Post-Retrieval Follow -up 
If the filter retrieval attempt is successful, the patient will assume the post -retrieval 
follow -up schedule.  Follow -up windows are intended as guidelines only.  They are not 
absolute and are not intended to limit data collection due to scheduling conflicts.  
 
• 1 Month Post -Retrieval (30 ± 15 days):  Office visit including an assessment of 
medic ations, hospitalizations, and medical conditions.  
 
Suspected PE post -retrieval must be objectively confirmed by imaging (i.e. pulmonary 
arteriography, cross -sectional imaging, or ventilation/perfusion lung scan) or at autopsy 
and will not count against the  primary endpoint.  
7.10 Duration of Study and Patient Participation  
Patients will be followed until 1 months after successful filter retrieval or until study 
completion 2 years after filter placement.  Total study duration (from study initiation 
through pa tient enrollment and follow -up) is expected to be less than 5 years.  
7.11 Imaging  
An imaging manual will be provided by the sponsor.  The imaging criteria specified in 
the manual should be followed for all imaging required per this CIP.  Any imaging 
perfor med at pre -procedure, filter placement, filter retrieval, or at any time during follow -
up to evaluate potential adverse events will be recorded on the appropriate CRF and 
submitted to the data coordinating center.  
7.12 Criteria and Procedures for Withdrawa l 
A patient may decide to withdraw from the study at any time without prejudice or loss of

CIP 12 -018-10, Version Date 01 March 2018  patient from the study at any time based on medical judgment.  In all instances of 
withdrawal, data collected up to the time of patient withdrawal, including the study exit 
form, should be submitted to the data coordinating center, and should includ e the reason 
why the patient has been withdrawn from the study.  Patients withdrawn from the study 
should be followed according to institutional standard of care.   
 
In the event a patient cannot be contacted for post -treatment assessments, at least three 
attempts should be made to contact the patient, and these efforts should be documented 
on the appropriate CRF.  If a patient misses post -treatment assessments and cannot be 
located, a lost to follow -up entry should be submitted.  
7.13 Participation Endpoint s of the Study  
A patient’s participation in the study will end after any of the following:  
• Completion of all scheduled clinical and imaging evaluations to 1 month post -
retrieval or 2 years post -placement;  
• Device not implanted;  
• Patient withdrawal or lost to  follow -up; 
• Closure of the study; or  
• Patient death.  
Any data collected on the patient up to a participation endpoint (or until all queries 
involving the patient are resolved) may be used in the study.  
8.0  Statistical Considerations  
8.1 Hypotheses to be Te sted 
The study hypotheses will be tested only for patients receiving Celect® filters.  No formal 
hypotheses will be tested for patients receiving the Günther Tulip® filter; rather, summary 
statistics will be presented for patients receiving the Günther Tul ip® filter.  
8.1.1  Primary Effectiveness Hypothesis  
The primary effectiveness endpoint is the rate of technical placement success and 12 -
month freedom from new symptomatic PE while a filter is indwelling.  The analysis 
requires that the performance goal of  90% be met for technical placement success and 
freedom from new symptomatic PE at 12 months while a filter is indwelling.  The 
Cook Research Incorporated  Page 34 of 56 
IVC Filter Study   
 
COMPANY CONFIDENTIAL  
CIP 12 -018-10, Version Date 01 March 2018  performance goal was derived based on what are considered clinically acceptable rates 
for technical placement success and new sy mptomatic PE in the overall population.48  
The performance goal will be said to have been met provided the null hypothesis is 
rejected in favor of the alternative with a one -tailed exact binomial test at the 0.025 level.  
The hypothesis will be tested only  for patients receiving Celect® filters.  Given that π is 
the probability that a randomly selected patient did not experience any technical 
placement failure or new symptomatic PE within 12 months while a filter is indwelling, 
the null and alternative hypo theses are as follows.  
Null Hypothesis: The rate of technical placement success and 12 -month freedom from 
new symptomatic PE while a filter is indwelling, π, does not meet the performance goal 
(90%).  
 H0: π ≤ 90%  
Alternative Hypothesis: The rate of technic al placement success and 12 -month freedom 
from new symptomatic PE while a filter is indwelling, π, meets the performance goal 
(90%).  
 Ha: π > 90%  
8.1.2  Primary Safety Hypothesis  
The primary safety endpoint is the rate of 12 -month freedom from major adverse events.  
Major adverse events are defined as: clinical perforation, clinical migration, clinical 
fracture, embolization of the filter or filter fragments to the heart or lungs, IVC 
thrombotic occlusion, new symptomatic DVT while a filter is indwell ing, access site 
complications with clinical sequelae, and procedure -/device -related death.  The analysis 
requires that the performance goal of 80% be met for freedom from major adverse events 
at 12 months.  The performance goal was derived based on what a re considered clinically 
acceptable rates for each complication in the overall population.48 
 
The null (H 0) and alternative (H A) hypotheses are expressed as follows:  
 
 H0:  S(t) ≤ 80%  
 Ha:  S(t)   > 80%  
 
Cook Research Incorporated  Page 35 of 56 
IVC Filter Study   
 
COMPANY CONFIDENTIAL  
CIP 12 -018-10, Version Date 01 March 2018  where:  
• t is time through 12 months  
• S(t) is the true rate of freedom from major adverse events at time t.  
 
The hypothesis will be assessed using a Z-statistic. The Z-statistic is given by  
   Z = ( 𝑆̂(𝑡) – 0.8)/SE  
 where:  
 
• 𝑆̂(𝑡) = Kaplan -Meier estimate of freedom from major adverse events 
(S(t)) at 12 months  
• SE = Standard Error = V(S(t)) , where 𝑉̂(𝑆̂(𝑡)) is the estimate of the 
variance of the Kaplan -Meier estimate using the methods described by 
Peto et al.50 
 
The performance goal will said to have been met provided the null hypothesis is rejected 
in favor of the alternative if 𝑆̂(𝑡)−0.8>ZαSE , for α = 0.025.  The hypothesis will be 
tested only for patients receiving Celect® filters.  
8.2 General Statistical An alyses  
Statistical analysis will be performed using SAS® for Windows® (release 9.3 or higher) or 
other widely accepted statistical software.  Clinically -relevant baseline variables will be 
tabulated by each stratum.  Continuous variables will be reported as means and standard 
deviations unless otherwise noted.  Categorical variables will be reported as percent.  
Unadjusted 95% confidence intervals will be presented for the secondary endpoints, with 
a footnote specifying that they are unadjusted.  Survival analysis techniques such as 
Kaplan -Meier or Cox Proportional Hazards w ill be incorporated if censoring of data 
occurs.  
8.3 Sample Size  
The study is designed to enroll 320 patients in the Celect® filter stratum (to evaluate the 
safety and effectiveness hypotheses) and up to 150 patients in the Günther Tulip® filter 
stratum at  up to 40 sites globally.  At least half of the study patients in the Celect® filter 
stratum will be enrolled at US sites.  
 
For the primary effectiveness endpoint, based on what are considered clinically 
acceptable rates for technical placement success and  new symptomatic PE in the overall 
Cook Research Incorporated  Page 36 of 56 
IVC Filter Study   
 
COMPANY CONFIDENTIAL  
CIP 12 -018-10, Version Date 01 March 2018  population, a performance goal of the rate of technical placement success and 12 -month 
freedom from new symptomatic PE while a filter is indwelling was established to be 
90%.48  Additionally, based on the data from previo us Cook sponsored studies (as 
summarized in Section 4.0), the rate of technical placement success and 12 -month 
freedom from new symptomatic PE while a filter was indwelling was estimated to be 
98.4% for the Celect® filter stratum.  A sample size of 70 pati ents will be required to 
assess the primary effectiveness hypothesis for the Celect® filter stratum, with a one -
sided exact binomial test, at a type I error rate of 0.025, and a power of 0.9.  The 
calculation was performed with the SAS UnifyPow macro.  
 
For the primary safety endpoint, based on what are considered clinically acceptable rates 
for each complication in the overall population, a performance goal of the rate of 12 -
month freedom from major adverse events was established to be 80%.48  Based on the 
data from previous Cook -sponsored studies (as summarized in Section 4.0), the rate of 
12-month freedom from major adverse events was estimated to be 92.2% for the Celect® 
filter stratum.  A sample size of 88 patients will be required to assess the primary safety 
hypothesis for the Celect® filter stratum, with a one -sided exact binomial test, at a type I 
error rate of 0.025, and a power of 0.9.  The calculation was performed with the SAS 
UnifyPow macro.  
 
Based on sample size calculations, a minimum of 88 pat ients in the Celect® filter stratum 
will be required to evaluate the safety and effectiveness endpoints.  Cook intends to 
enroll 320 patients in the Celect® filter stratum; this sample size allows for an attrition 
rate of 72% (i.e., 60% of filters to be re trieved prior to 12 months and an additional 12% 
of patients who may die, withdraw, or become lost to follow -up).  The study may also 
enroll up to 150 patients in the Günther Tulip® filter stratum.  
8.4 Missing Data  
If the amount of missing data does not re sult in a reduction of analyzable patients to a 
number that is below that which is required for sufficient statistical power of the primary 
endpoints, case deletion will be the primary method to handle missing data.   
 
However, if missing data results in a  reduction of analyzable patients to a number that is 
lower than what is required for sufficient statistical power of the primary measures, then 
missing data will be addressed using multiple imputation with best available data, if 
Cook Research Incorporated  Page 37 of 56 
IVC Filter Study   
 
COMPANY CONFIDENTIAL  
CIP 12 -018-10, Version Date 01 March 2018  appropriate.  This method  will be used to predict missing endpoint and imaging data.  
Previous clinical trial experience suggests that some portion of the imaging data may not 
meet the criteria for accurate review by the core laboratory; however, it is recognized that 
the investig ator uses this information to provide the best possible care for the patient.  
Therefore, it is reasonable to substitute any missing core laboratory measurements with 
the corresponding measurements made by the investigator or institutional staff.  
 
Statisti cal imputation strategies originating from Schafer may also be used, supplemented 
with notes provided by Shafer.51,52  All missing endpoint and covariate data will be 
imputed with the values simulated from their respective empirical distributions.  The 
computations (with no covariates) will be performed using five imputed datasets and 
PROC MI and PROC MIANALYZE in SAS version 9.3, or WinBUGS 1.4 or later.  
Unless evidence suggests otherwise, missing at random data will be assumed.  
 
Additional analyses may a lso be performed to address missing data, including tipping 
point analysis.  
8.5 Site-level Poolability  
At the final analysis, poolability of data from multiple sites will be verified by examining 
the primary safety and effectiveness endpoints using logisti c regression models.  Site -
level poolability will be considered appropriate provided that these measures are similar 
among sites.  
 
It is expected that some sites may have too few patients to provide reasonable site -level 
estimates of the primary measures.  Each investigative site will be allowed to enroll no 
more than 20% of the patients in each stratum to ensure the overall results are not biased 
by the results from a single site.  Pooling of this information will be explored based on 
hospital size (large versus small, determined based on number of beds and annual number 
of discharges), site enrollment (large versus small), type of hospital (community versus 
teaching), and other group -wise strategies.  
 
It is recognized that patient baseline characteristics may differ among sites, with some 
sites routinely treating specific patient types (e.g., trauma patients).  It is anticipated that 
the primary endpoint measures may be related to covariates that reflect this.  Thus, 
observed site -specific differences among  the primary endpoints will be checked for 
Cook Research Incorporated  Page 38 of 56 
IVC Filter Study   
 
COMPANY CONFIDENTIAL  
CIP 12 -018-10, Version Date 01 March 2018  confounding with other measured covariates (e.g., age, sex).  This can be accomplished 
using logistic regression models that include site and other measured covariates as 
independent variables.  
 
Should one or more  sites be found to differ significantly from the rest, then logistic 
regression analysis will be performed with an intercept term and a covariate to 
distinguish between the unusual site(s) and those sites that are considered poolable. 
Analysis on the prima ry endpoints will be performed by constructing 95% confidence 
interval on odds ratio for the intercept term.  
8.6 Limitations of the Study  
All patients will be required to meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria specified in this 
document, which may limit the overall range of patients to which inferences may be 
applied.  Additionally, this study is not designed to provide data beyond 2 years af ter 
filter placement or beyond 1 month after filter retrieval.  
9.0 Deviations from Clinical Investigation Plan  
Investigators are not allowed to deviate from this CIP without prior authorization by the 
sponsor except under emergency situations when necessary to preserve the rights, safety, 
or well -being of study patients.  
 
Deviations (failures to follow requirements of the CIP) and noncompliances (failures to 
follow applicable regulations) will be recorded together with an explanation.  Deviations 
or noncompliances that impact the rights, welfare, or safety of patients shall be promptly 
reported to the sponsor and IRB/EC/REB as required.  
 
If appropriate, corrective and preventive actions will be discussed by the sponsor, 
investigator, and/or the IRB/E C/REB to determine a suitable course of action.  
10.0 Data Collection and Reporting  
10.1 Electronic Case Report Forms  
Patient data will be collected and entered by trained personnel at the clinical site onto 
electronic Case Report Forms (eCRFs) through an Electronic Data Capturing (EDC) 
system.  This is a secure, web -based system, allowing those with permission to access 
Cook Research Incorporated  Page 39 of 56 
IVC Filter Study   
 
COMPANY CONFIDENTIAL  
CIP 12 -018-10, Version Date 01 March 2018  data from any location at any time.  Source data are to be retained for data entered into 
the eCRF system.  Data obtained and simultaneous ly entered into the EDC system may 
also serve as source documentation.  Worksheets created from the eCRF are available to 
each site and may serve as source documentation (e.g., 18 -month telephone follow -up).  
Site personnel are required to undergo data ent ry training and will have unique login 
names and passwords in order to enter patient data.  In accordance with 21 CFR Part 11, 
the eCRF system creates a secure, computer -generated, time stamped audit trail to record 
the date and time of operator entries an d actions that create, modify, or delete electronic 
records.  
10.2 Data Reporting  
Progress  reports will be submitted to FDA  every 6 months for the first 2 years of the 
study and annually thereafter, from the date that this CIP is approved by FDA .  A final 
report will be submitted to FDA no later than three months after study completion ( i.e., 
after the last patient completes their last follow -up visit).  In the event the study is 
terminated prior to completion, a final report will be submitted to FDA no late r than three 
months after study termination.   
 
Also, as required by local regulations, progress reports and a final report at the conclusion 
of the clinical study will be submitted by the investigators and sponsor to the regulatory 
authorities and/or IRB/ EC/REB.  
11.0 Data Management and Quality Assurance  
11.1 Data Entry and Quality Assurance  
Each principal investigator or appropriately trained designee shall enter the clinical data 
into the electronic data capture system on standardized CRFs.  Investigator s will provide 
all applicable clinical data and documentation to the sponsor.  Patient data and documents 
pertaining to the study will be kept and archived by the sponsor.  Data will be reviewed 
for missing data, data consistency, and reasonableness of res ponses.  Discrepancies will 
be resolved through a formal query process involving direct contact with investigators or 
research coordinators.  The data coordinating center is responsible for database 
management, data verification, data archiving, and data r etention.

COMPANY CONFIDENTIAL  
CIP 12 -018-10, Version Date 01 March 2018  As needed to assist the sponsor in its research (e.g., during evaluation of an adverse 
event), data will be accessible to the sponsor, the participating investigators, the 
manufacturer, and companies or individuals the sponsor authorizes.  
11.2 Data Monitoring Arrangements  
The conduct of the clinical study will be supervised through a process of remote and on -
site monitoring.  The data coordinating center will remotely monitor the study for data 
completeness and for adverse events.  On -site monito ring will be implemented as 
necessary throughout the course of the study.  The investigator/institution will provide 
direct access to source data/documents for study -related monitoring, audits, IRB/EC/REB 
review, and regulatory inspection.  Written procedu res for monitoring the study are 
maintained by the data coordinating center and are summarized in Appendix B.  
12.0 Safety Monitoring and Procedures for Reporting Adverse Events  
12.1 Safety Monitoring  
An independent Clinical Events Committee (CEC) consistin g of physicians, who are not 
investigators in the study and who do not have a perceived conflict of interest with the 
conduct and administration of the study, will be established to adjudicate clinical events 
reported during the study.  This adjudication w ill be performed to assess whether the 
events were due to a pre -existing or unrelated condition, or were procedure -related, 
technique -related, and/or device -related.  
 
A central core laboratory will be used for image analysis to provide uniformly defined 
analysis of images.  
 
Regularly scheduled reviewing/monitoring of all patient data will be conducted at the 
data coordinating center, in part, for identification of adverse events and assurance that 
they are correctly reported to the CEC.   
12.2 Adverse Eve nt Reporting  
Adverse events are to be reported to the data coordinating center using the appropriate 
CRF.  In cases of serious adverse events or adverse device effects (i.e., adverse event 
with relation to the study device), completed forms should be submi tted to the data 
coordinating center as soon as possible upon knowledge of the event.

Definitions  
 
Access site complications with clinical sequelae  - Arteriovenous fistula, hematoma, or 
bleeding requiring transfusion (≥ 2 units), hospit alization (either admission or extended 
stay), or further treatment.  
 
Access site thrombus – Occlusive or nonocclusive thrombus developing at venotomy 
site after filter insertion or retrieval, documented by ultrasound or other imaging.  
 
Adverse events  – Definition may be found in applicable regulations.  
 
Adverse device effects – Definition may be found in applicable regulations.  
 
Clinical fracture  – A loss of structural integrity (breakage or separation) of the filter 
identified by imaging and associat ed with clinical sequelae and/or requiring intervention.  
 
Clinical migration  – Caudal or cranial movement of a filter resulting in surgical or 
endovascular intervention.  
 
Clinical perforation  – Protrusion of filter legs through the wall of the IVC causing 
hemorrhage or hematoma or touching, impressing, or perforating another organ (e.g., 
liver, bowel, aorta, psoas muscle, vertebral body, lymph nodes).  Acute perforation 
occurring during placement of the filter is considered a placement problem.  Documented 
using CT.  
 
Deep vein thrombosis (DVT)  – Thrombus in the deep veins, usually of the lower 
extremities or pelvis.  Documented by contrast venography, duplex ultrasound, CT, or 
magnetic resonance (MR) venography. The proximal extent of thrombus should be

COMPANY CONFIDENTIAL  
CIP 12 -018-10, Version Date 01 March 2018  Filter deformation  – Insufficient opening of filter (i.e., filter legs do not adjust 
themselves to the size of the IVC), collapse of filter, uneven distribution of filter le gs, 
bending of filter, or crossing or entangling of two or more filter legs.  
 
Filter embolization  – Post-placement movement of the filter or its components to a 
distant anatomic site completely out of the target zone (i.e., heart/lungs). Documented by 
imag ing or autopsy.  
 
Filter fracture  – Any loss of structural integrity (breakage or separation) of the filter 
identified by imaging or autopsy.  Documented by imaging or at autopsy.  
 
Filter leg interaction with the IVC1 –  
Grade 0:  Normal; filter strut confined entirely within the IVC.  
Grade 1:  Filter strut is immediately adjacent to the external aspect of the IVC wall 
(likely reflecting tenting of the IVC wall).  
Grade 2:  Filter strut is entirely outside of the IVC lumen and within the 
retroperitoneum as  evidenced by a “halo” of retroperitoneal fat around 
axially viewed strut.  
Grade 3:  Filter strut is touching, impressing, or perforating another organ (e.g., 
liver, bowel, aorta, psoas muscle, vertebral body, lymph nodes).  
 
Filter migration  – Change in fi lter position compared to its deployed position (cranial or 
caudal).  Migration will be classified as significant (i.e., > 20 mm) or insignificant  
(i.e., < 20 mm).  Documented by plain radiograph, CT, or venography.  
 
Filter tilt –  Angle of the longitudinal axis of the filter with respect to the longitudinal 
IVC axis.  Tilt will be classified as significant (i.e., ≥ 16° relative to the IVC longitudinal 
axis) or insignificant (i.e., < 16° relative to the IVC longitudinal axis).  A filter is 
consid ered free of tilt if it appears centered in the IVC.  Documented by plain radiograph 
or venography.

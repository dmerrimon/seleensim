  SYNOPSIS   
Study Title:  A Phase I/II, Randomized, Double -Masked, Vehicle -Controlled Study of the 
Safety, Tolerability, and Efficacy of AXR-270 Topical Eyelid Cream in 
Treating Posterior Blepharitis Associated w ith Meibomian Gland Dysfunction. 
Study Objectives:  The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of 
two concentrations of AXR -270 Cream (0.2% AXR -270 Cream; 2.0% AXR -
270 Cream) in treating posterior blepharitis associated with Meibomian Gland Disease ( MGD ).   
The secondary objective is to evaluate the efficacy of AXR -270 Cream in 
treating signs and symptoms of posterior blepharitis associated with MGD.  
Study Population:  Subjec ts with a diagnosis of symptomatic posterior blepharitis associated with 
MGD will be included in this trial. 
Number of 
Subjects:  Approximately one hundred and twenty -six (126) subjects  across 10 -16 sites.  
Investigational 
Products:  
 • 0.2% AXR -270 Topical eyelid Cream  
• 2.0% AXR -270 Topical eyelid Cream  
• AXR -270 Vehicle  
Route and 
Duration of Administration: AXR -270 Cream will be administered as a topical ophthalmic cream. Subjects 
will receive Investigational Product ( IP) administered in the clinic at Day 
1/Visit 2 and will self -administer either AXR -270 Cream or Vehicle once a day 
(QD) applied to upper and lower eyelid skin bilaterally for approximately 21 
days.  
Study Design:   This is a multi -center, double -masked, randomized, vehicle -controlled, two 
cohort study. Subjects will be randomized into either 0.2% AXR -270 Cream , 
2.0% AXR -270 Cream or V ehicle administered in both eyes. 
Cohort 1 : 
Approximately sixty-three (63) subjects with a diagnosis of symptomatic 
posterior blepharitis associated with MGD meeting all inclusion/exclusion 
criteria at the Screening visit (Visit 1) will be asked to discontinue their eyelid 
hygiene regimen and use only Sponsor supplied commercial sterile eyelid 
wipes between Visit 1 and Visit 2 daily  (Equalization Period) . Subjects will 
then be evaluated at Baseline/Randomization (Visit 2; Week 0/Day 1) to 
confirm they continue to meet all inclusion/exclusion and are eligible for 
randomization. Note: The daily use of  sponsor -supplied  sterile eyelid wipes is 
to be discontinued after randomization at Visit 2. All subjects within this 
Cohort will be assessed for safety and exploratory efficacy. Both Investigator 
and subje cts will be masked as to the IP . Subjects will be shown an 
instructional video on applying the investigational product  to help ensure 
consistency in application across subjects. Further, the site should reinforce to 
the subject how to self -administer the IP to the eyelids and avoid ocular

  instillation. Subjects will self -administer a pre -specified volume 
(approximately 50 milligrams per eyelid) of 0.2% AXR -270 Cream or its 
Vehicle across the epidermis corresponding  to the external surface overlying 
the tarsal plate of the upper and lower eyelids of both eyes. Refer to more 
detailed instructions in the Subject Dosing Instructions document. Blood draws 
for safety labs for all subjects will be performed prior to IP dosing  in the clinic 
at Visit 2/Day 1 . Following the in -clinic dose administration, subject s will be 
supplied with sufficient IP (2 tubes)  to apply once daily at home in the evening 
during  the treatment period. Subjects will self -administer IP QD in the 
evenings beginning on Day 2 .  
 On the following week (Visit 3 ; Week 1/Day 8), the Investigators will examine 
the subject and perform all safety and efficacy assessments (excluding safety labs and d ilated Ophthalmo scopy ).  
 Subjects will return for a Week 2 (Visit 4 ; Day 15) visit, wherein the 
Investigators will examine the subject and perform all safety and efficacy assessments (excluding safety labs and d ilated Ophthalmoscopy). Subjects  will 
return the used IP and will be instructed to use the 2
nd IP tube dispensed at 
Visit 2  to apply once daily at home in the evening for the remaining 1 week of 
treatment duration.  
 
Following the completion of the fifteenth ( 15th) subject  from Visit 4 of Cohort 
1, the Data Safety Review Committee (DSRC) will meet to review safety data and will make a recommendation about whether to allow escalation  to the 
higher (2.0%) dose of AXR -270 Cream for Cohort 2, which if recommended, 
will begin immediately upon the completion of enrollment in Cohort 1  (See 
Appendix 2) . 
 Subjects will return for a Week 3 (Visit 5 ; Day 22) visit, wherein the 
Investigators will examine the subject and perform all safety and efficacy assessments (including s afety l abs). Subjects should not dose at Visit 5/Day 22 
and following the visit, subjects  will exit the study. Remaining IP will be 
collected from every subject. (See Appendix 1 for procedures planned for this 
study) . 
 
Cohort 2 : 
Following the completion of the fifteenth subject from Visit 4 of Cohort 1, the 
DSRC  will meet to review safety data and will make a recommendation about 
whether to escalate to the higher (2.0%) dose of AXR -270 Cream for Cohort 2, 
which if recommended, wil l begin upon completion of enrollment in Cohort 1.  
 
The Screening and study visits will be conducted in the same fashion as 
described above  for Cohort 1 . Approximately sixty -three (63) subjects will be 
randomized to 2.0% AXR -270 Cream or its V ehicle.

  1. INTRODUCTION  
 
Posterior blephari tis is a condition characterized by inflammation of the posterior lid margin .  
The condition may be inclusive of MGD in which there is an alteration in the quality and 
expression of gland secretions ( Nelson, 2011). Meibomian gland dysfunction is associated 
with posterior blepharitis, plays an essential role in the health and stability of the tear film and 
in maintaining optimal ocular surfac e condition. It  is recognized as one of the most common 
pathologies seen by Ophthalmologist and is a significant contribut or to Evaporative D ry Eye 
(EDE) is  further considered the leading cause of Dry Eye D isease (DED) ( Nelson, 2011; 
DEWS II Report 2017 ). Meibomian gland dysfunction is commonly  treated on a chronic basis 
(DEWS II Report 2017)  via either  mechanical therapy (lid hygiene, lid massage and lid 
compression/expression) alone or in combination with topical or systemic antibiotics or topical cyclosporine.   
Dry Eye Disease is a w idespread dysfunction of the tears and ocular surface and is 
characterized by ocular signs such as inflammation of the ocular surface (Pflugfelder, 1999 ) 
and tear film instability ( Holly, 1973; Bron, 2001; Goto, 2003 ) resulting in corneal and 
conjunctival epithelial changes. D ry Eye Disease is a d ysfunction with etiologies inclusive of 
aqueous deficient and evaporative DED ( DEWS II Report 2017 ). These changes are 
understood t o be the underlying basis for EDE  in human subjects ( Foulks, 2003; D EWS II 
Report 2017 ).  
A number of studies and reports support the short- term use of topical corticosteroids known to 
be potent anti -inflammatory agents in the treatment of patients with DED ( Avunduk et al, 
2003; DEWS II Report 2017; Pflugfelder et al, 1999; Yang et al, 2006 ).  While topical 
ophthalmic corticosteroids are approved by the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA) for 
corticosteroid -responsive inflammatory conditions of the conjunctiva, cornea, and anterior 
globe, they are generally only recommended for short-term use, as prolonged use may result 
in adverse ocular events, including elevated Intraocular Pressure ( IOP), cataracts, and ocular 
infection (Becker, 1964; Bowling and Russell, 2011; Dinning, 1976). Short- term 
corticosteroid therapy can serve as both an important adjunct to existing chronic therapies 
(e.g., artificial tears) and can also be used to address environmental and iatrogenic induced 
breakthrough periods of inc reased ocular surface inflammation (Becker, 1964; Behrens et al, 
2006).  
Pflugfelder and colleagues ( Pflugfe lder, 2004) demonstrated that a topical corticosteroid may 
achieve the objective of a short -term treatment of acute exacerbations of DED signs or 
symptoms. They evaluated loteprednol etabonate ophthalmic suspension (0.5%) dosed 4 times 
daily versus placebo for the treatment of DED in patients with delayed tear clearance. In 
patients with at least moderate clinical inflammation, significant differences in clinical signs 
(nasal and tarsal hyperemia) between groups were observed as early as Week 2 and persisted

  through Week 4 of the study. In addition, the improvement in the redness V isual Analog S cale 
(VAS) score was consistently 20% better in the loteprednol- treated patients compared with 
the V ehicle -treated patients.  
Axero Vision, Inc. intends to develop AXR-270 Cream , for the treatment of MGD secondary 
to posterior blepharitis . Study AXR201901 wi ll evaluate the safety and tolerability of AXR-
270 Cream  in subjects with  lid margin inflammation (as characterized by eyelid margin 
hyperemia ) due to Meibomian Gland Dysfunction. Additional information about AXR-270 
Cream , including nonclinical pharmacology study results, and potential risks and benefits to 
human subjects, is found in the Investigator’s Brochure.  
AXR-270 was initially in clinical development  for asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease (COPD) and atopic dermatitis. Early testing was conducted in the European Union 
(EU), under an Investigational Medicinal Product Dossier ( IMPD ), and consisted of 
evaluation in 24 healthy male volunteers administered via topica l administration with the goal 
of identifying any blanching response in the skin at doses up to 4000ng using a method 
described by McKenzie and Stoughton ( McKenzie and Stoughton, 1962).  It was later 
delivered via inhalation to 36 healthy male subjects in a dose escalation safety study with both single and repeat doses. Additionally, a repeat dose study in 24 male steroid naive asthmatics 
and 36 mild to moderate subjects with mild asthma for one (1) month. AXR-270 was then 
evaluated in 12 healthy adult male  subjects for 14 days of oral inhalation and as a dermal 
cream for 42 days in 20 healthy volunteers and for 21 days in 25 patients with moderate or severe atopic dermatitis.  
Based on the physicochemical characteristics of Axero Vision ’s topical cream  formulation , 
reported anti- inflammatory properties of AXR-270 Cream and rationale described above, 
development of AXR-270 Cream  is proposed for ophthalmic conditions , such as MGD,  in 
which ocular inflammation is thought to be the source of pathology. 
 
1.1. DESCRIPTION OF INVESTIGATIONAL PRODUCT  
 
AXR-270 Cream (0.2% and 2.0%) contain AXR- 270 as an active pharmaceutical ingredient 
(API).  
The AXR- 270 Vehicle control has the same composition as AXR -270 Cream except that it 
does not contain AXR-270.

CONFIDENTIAL  
  1.2. JUSTIFICATION FOR ROUTE OF ADMINISTRATION AND DOSE SELECTION  
 
AXR-270 will be administered as a topical ophthalmic cream . Subjects will receive IP  
administered in the clinic at Day 1/Visit 2  and will then self -administer either AXR-270 
Cream  or Vehicle once a day ( QD) applied to upper and lower eyelid skin bilaterally for 
approximately 21 days. The concentrations of AXR -270 Cream and dosing schedule were 
chosen based on nonclinical pharmacokinetic and toxicology studies and data reflecting 
relative safety  multiples.  For details on the pharmacokinetic and toxicology studies and the 
respective safety multiples, see the Investigator’s Brochure.   
 
The purpose of using lid wipes  during the Equalization P eriod  (between Visit 1 and Visit 2) is 
to normalize baseline conditions between subjects as much as possible.  
For subjects wearing eyelid or eyelash makeup, remove makeup before IP application. (Use of 
eyelid  or eyelash  makeup may be resumed between clinic visits with the exception of the day 
of study visits). Subjects should be instructed to follow their usual routine to remove eyelid  or 
eyelash  makeup  between Visits 2 and 5  (including eyelid wipes, if applicable), ensuring that 
no new products/techniques are introduced during the treatment period . Each dose of IP 
should be applied onto the upper and lower eyelids (refer to detailed instructions in the 
Subject Dosing Instructions document).  Subjects will also view an instructional video at Visit 
2 demonstrating the proper dosing technique.  
 
Subjects should not wipe away excess cream unless there is a concern of the cream running 
onto the ocular surface. For subjects who wish to apply eyelid makeup, they should wait until 
the next morning before cleaning the eyelids and applying makeup.  
 
1.3. GCP
 COMPLIANCE   
 This clinical trial will be conducted in compliance with the protocol, International Council on 
Harmonisation (ICH)  guidelines , Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines , and other 
applicable regulatory requirements.

3.2. DESCRIPTION OF TRIAL DESIGN  
 
Design and Investigational Plan:   
This is a multi -center, double-masked, randomized, vehicle-controlled, two cohort study. 
Subjects will be randomized into either 0.2% AXR-270 Cream (approximately 42 subjects in 
Cohort 1), 2.0% AXR-270 Cream (approximately 42 subjects in Cohort 2) or Vehicle (approximately 42 subjects) administered in both eyes.  
 
Cohort 1: 
Approximately sixty -three (63) subjects with a diagnosis of symptomatic posterior blepharitis 
associated with MGD meeting all inclusion/exclusion criteria at the Screening visit (Visit 1) will be asked to discontinue their eyelid hygiene regimen and use only Sponsor supplied commercial sterile eyelid wipes between Visit 1 and Visit 2 daily  (Equalization Period).  
Subjects will then be evaluated at Baseline/Randomization (Visit 2; Week 0/Day 1) to  confirm they continue to meet all inclusion/exclusion and are eligible for randomization. Note: The use of sponsor-supplied sterile eyelid wipes is to be discontinued after randomization at Visit 2. All subjects within this Cohort will be assessed for safety and exploratory efficacy. Both Investigator and subjects will be masked as to the IP. Subjects will 
be shown an instructional video on applying the investigational  product to help ensure 
consistency in application across subjects. Further, t he site should reinforce  to the subject how 
to self -administer the IP to the eyelids and avoid ocular instillation. Subjects will self-
administer a pre -specified volume (approximately 50 milligrams per eyelid) of 0.2% AXR -
270 Cream or its Vehicle across the epidermis correspondin g to the external surface overlying 
the tarsal plate of the upper and lower eyelids of both eyes. Refer to more detailed instructions 
in the Subject Dosing Instructions document. Blood draws for safety labs for all subjects will 
be performed prior to IP do sing in the clinic at Visit 2/Day 1 . Following the in- clinic dose 
administration, subjects will be supplied with sufficient IP (2 tubes) to apply once daily at 
home in the evening during the treatment period. Subjects will self -administer IP QD in the 
even ings beginning on Day 2.

  On the following week (Visit 3; Week 1/Day 8), the I nvestigators will examine the subject 
and perform all safety and efficacy assessments (excluding safety labs and dilated 
Ophthalmoscopy).  
 
Subjects will return for a Week 2 (Visit 4; Day 15) visit, wherein the I nvestigators will 
examine the subject and perform all safety and efficacy assessments (excluding safety labs and dilated Ophthalmoscopy). Subjects will return the used IP and will be 
instructed to use the 
2nd IP tube dispensed at Visit 2  to apply once daily at home in the evening for the remaining 1 
week of treatment duration.  
 Following the completion of the fifteenth (15
th) subject from Visit 4 of Cohort 1, the Data 
Safety Review Committee (DSRC) will meet to review safety data and will make a recommendation about whether to escalate to the higher (2.0%) dose of AXR -270 Cream for 
Cohort 2, which if recommended, will begin immediately upon comple tion of enrollment in 
Cohort 1.  Subjects will return for a Week 3 (Visit 5; Day 22) visit, wherein the I nvestigators will 
examine the subject and perform all safety and efficacy assessments (including s afety labs). 
Subjects should not dose at Visit 5/Day 2 2 and following the visit, subjects and will exit the 
study. Remaining IP will be collected from every subject. (See Appendix 1 for procedures 
planned for this study).

The Screening and study visits will be conducted in the same fashion as described above for 
Cohort 1. Approximately sixty-three (63) subjects will be randomized to 2.0% AXR-270 Cream or its Vehicle.  A study schematic follows ( Figure 1 ). 
 
3.2.1. Investigational P roduct  
The AXR-270 Cream IP  is a sterile, water in oil, cream formulation in which micronized 
AXR-270 A ctive P harmaceutical  Ingredient (API ) is suspended uniformly for topical 
application to the upper and lower eyelid s at either 0.2 % or 2.0% concentrations.  
 
The IP  is packaged in laminated polyfoil tubes. Each tube will contain 5g of sterile AXR-270 
topical cream. Subjects randomized to the Vehicle  control arm will receive the same 
containers containing all components at the concentrations used in the AXR-270 Cream 
except for  the active component.

Each  randomized, double- masked IP kit contains 3 tubes of IP, each  tube  sufficient for 2 
weeks of dosing.   
IP Dispensation Instructions  
At Visit 2, randomized subjects will be assigned to an IP  Kit which contains three tubes of 
Double- Masked IP ( AXR-270 Cream  or Vehicle ). The first dose of Double-M asked IP ( AXR-
270 Cream  or Vehicle) will be self -administered by the subject at Visit 2 under supervision of 
the site staff . 
AXR-270 Cream  should be stored at 2° to  8°C ( 36° to 46°F); excursions permitted between  0° 
and 15°C ( 32° and 59°F). Transient spikes up to 25°C (77 °F) and not to exceed 24 hours are 
permitted. IP should be protected  from light and moisture.  The refrigerator will be 
temperature monitored.  IP will be supplied to subjects in coolers with gel packs to maintain 
refrigerated temperature while in transit.  
 
Timing of Self- Administration  
At Visit 2, sufficient training will be provided to the subjects to self -administer their once -
daily dose of double-masked IP. Subjects will then self -administer additional doses of IP at 
home for the remainder of the study. Two tubes of randomized double- masked IP will be 
dispensed  to each subject at Visit 2 for self -administration. The first tube will be used from 
the time of Visit 2 to the time of Visit 4. The second IP tube will be used from Visit 4 to Visit 
5 (note: if a subject is unable to come in to the clinic for Visit 4, they should begin dosing 
with the second tube on Day 15).  One tube from the kit will be kept in r eserve at the clinic. 
Refer to more detailed instructions in the Subject Dosing Instructions document.  
3.2.2. Methods to Minimize Bias  
To minimize bias, the following measures will be taken:  
• IP allocation ( AXR-270 Cream  versus Vehicle ) will be randomized and masked to the 
Sponsor , subjects, and investigat ive staff . 
• The randomization schedule will be generated by an independent unmasked 
statistician (who is not on the project team) or designee and maintained in a secure and limited -access location separate from the study Investigator and members of the 
project team.

5.2. SUBJECT WITHDRAWAL AND /OR DISCONTINUATION  
 
Any subject who wishes to discontinue IP  use or withdraw from participation in the study for 
any reason is entitled to do so without obligation. The Investigator may also discontinue any 
subject from IP  use or from study participation, if deemed necessary.  
 Investigational product use may be discontinued, and any subject may be discontinued from 
study participation at any time during the study at the discretion of the Investigator or the 
Sponsor for any reason including but not limited to: 
 
1. Occurrence of any medical condition or circumstance that exposes the subject to 
substantial risk and/or does not allow the subject to adhere to the requirements of the 
protocol. 
2. Any Serious Adverse Event ( SAE ), clinically significant AE, severe laboratory 
abnormality, intercurrent illness, or other medical condition that in dicates to the 
Investigator that continued participation is not in the best interest of the subject.  
3. Subject's decision to withdraw. 
4. Any woman who becomes pregnant while participating in the study. Information on the pregnancy and outcome will be requested . 
5. Subject’s failure to comply with protocol requirements or study related procedures.  
6. Termination of the study by the Sponsor, FDA, or other regulatory authorities. 
 In the event study discontinuation of a randomized subject is necessary, the Investigator 
should make every attempt to have the subject complete Visit 5 assessments. If a non -serious 
AE is unresolved at the time of the subject’s final study visit, an effort will be made to follow up until the AE is resolved or stabilized, the subject is lost to  follow -up, or there is some other 
resolution of the event. The Investigator should make every attempt to follow all SAEs to resolution. The reason for premature discontinuation should be entered into the e CRF and 
recorded in the subject chart.  
Subjects w ho withdraw from the study will not be replaced.

6.1. INVESTIGATIONAL PRODUCTS TO BE ADMINISTERED  
 
All subjects meeting Randomization criteria at Visit 2  will be randomized to either AXR-270 
Cream  (0.2% or 2.0%) or Vehicle. Two tubes of randomized double-masked IP  will be 
dispensed to each subject at Visit 2 for self -administration  (with one tube from each kit 
remaining at the site to serve as a back -up). The first tube will be used from the time of Visit 2 
to the time of Visit 4 . The second IP tube will be used from Visit 4 to Visit 5 (note: if a 
subject is unable to come to the clinic for Visit 4, they should begin dosing with the second 
tube on Day 15). The first  used tube of IP will be returned to the site at Visit  4. The second  
used tube of IP will be returned at Visit 5. The IP  will be stored at the site in a secure area 
with limited access at controlled refrigerated  temperature 2° to  8°C [36° to 46°F ] with 
excursions permitted between 0° and 15°C [32° and 59°F]. Transient spikes up to 25°C (77 °F) and not to exceed 24 hours are permitted.  The refrigerator will be temperature monitored.  
IP will be supplied to subjects in coolers with gel packs to maintain refrigerated temperature 
while in transit.   
Subjects will be asked to administer IP  QD in the evening (except on Day 1 when IP will be 
administered during the office visit). It is important that IP is applied to the full eyelid  as per 
detailed instructions in the Subject Dosing Instructions document. Subjects should be 
instructed to wash hands thoroughly prior to and after  administration of IP.  
The subjects will record the date and time of administration of each dose of IP at the time of 
instillation  in a dosing diary. Compliance with applica tion of IP will be reviewed and assessed 
at Visit 3 through Visit 5. 
 
6.2. C
ONCOMITANT MEDICATIONS  
 All medications that the subject has taken 1 month prior to Visit 1 and through Visit 5 or 
discontinuation from the study will be recorded in the eCRF and the subject chart. The 
generic name of the drug, dose, route of administration, duration of treatment (including start 
and stop dates), frequency, indication, and whether or not the medication was taken due to an 
AE will be recorded for each medication.  
 6.2.1. Permi tted Medications and Therapies  
 Medications and therapies not specifically excluded in Section 6.2.2 may be taken as 
necessary.    
 Omega -3 supplements are permitted if the dose is stable within 3 months of Visit 1  and 
expected to remain stable for the duration of the study.

  6.4. DRUG ACCOUNTABILITY  
 
Sponsor study monitors or designees will conduct accountability of IP  (AXR -270 Cream  or 
Vehicle ). Accountability will be ascertained by performing reconciliation between the number 
of kits/tubes  sent to the site , accounted for at the  time of reconciliation  during routine 
monitoring and at the end of the study.  
Clinical trial materials will be shipped to the investigational sites under sealed conditions.  
Shipment records will be verified by comparing the shipment inventory sheet to the actual quantity of drug received at the site. Accurate records of receipt and disposition of the IP 
(e.g., dates, quantity, subject number, dose dispensed, returned) must be maintained by the 
Investigator or his/her designee. The Subject ID format will be XXX-001, where XXX  
represents the site number and the last three digits represent the unique subject number .  
 
At the end of the study, all study materials, including any used and unused IP  (AXR-270 
Cream  or Vehicle kits ), as well as original tube containers (even if empty), will be destroyed 
or returned to the Sponsor (or designee) in accordance with Sponsor or designee’s S tandard 
Operating Procedures (SOPs) , following approval by the Sponsor. All returns of IP  will be 
documented. The study monitor or designee will verify drug accountability. All drug 
accounting procedures must be completed before the study is considered complete. 
 
6.5. M
AINTENANCE OF RANDOMIZATION AND PROCEDURE FOR BREAKING THE CODE 
 The Sponsor , the project teams at the designated Contract Research Organizations (CROs), 
and investigative staff responsible for assessments of study endpoints will be masked to IP  
assignments . In the absence of medical  need, the randomization code will not be available to 
the above individuals until after the study is completed and the database is locked. 
 
In the event of a medical need, the Investigator will treat each subject as needed. Since there 
is no specific anti dote to AXR-270 Cream, immediate emergency unmasking is not necessary.  
If the Investigator feels it is necessary to unmask a subject’s assignment after an emergency  
situation, the Investigator may call the M edical Monitor and notify the Sponsor. The IP 
assignment will be revealed on a subject -by-subject basis with the approval of the M edical 
Monitor and Sponsor , thus leaving the masking of the remaining subjects intact.  
 A randomization code will be computer- generate d by Axero Vision, Inc. or designee. 
Randomization team members will work independently of other team members at the CRO. Study personnel, study subjects, the Sponsor, and project teams at the CROs involved in the 
study will be masked to IP assignments.

  8. ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY  
8.1. SAFETY PARAMETERS  
 
Safety parameters include:  
• AE Monitoring 
• BCVA  
• Slit-l amp biomicroscopy and external eye exam   
• IOP  
• Dilated Ophthalmoscopy  
• Safety lab draw  
 
8.2. ADVERSE EVENT DEFINITIONS  
 Adverse Event  (AE) :  Any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of an IP  in 
humans, whether or not considered drug related.   
Adverse Reaction (AR) : Any AE  caused by a drug. Adverse reactions are a subset of all 
suspected adverse reactions where there is reason to  conclude that the drug caused the event.  
 
Suspected Adverse Reaction (SAR) : Any AE  for which there is a reasonable possibility that 
the drug caused the AE . For the purposes of IND safety reporting, “reasonable possibility” 
means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the AE. A SAR 
implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality than adverse reaction, which means any 
AE caused by a drug.  
 Unexpected:   An AE or SAR is considered “unexpec ted” if it is not listed in the 
Investigator ’s Brochure or is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed; or, 
if an Investigator ’s Brochure is not required or available, is not consistent with the risk 
information described in the general investigational plan or elsewhere in the current application.   
 
Life-threatening:  An AE  or SAR is considered “life- threatening” if, in the view of either the 
Investigator or Sponsor, its occurrence places the subject at immediate risk of death. It do es 
not include an AE or suspected adverse reaction that, had it occurred in a more severe form, 
might have caused death.   
 
 
 
AXR 201901  Protocol  Incorporating Amendment 02_ 03Jun2020_ FINAL    Page 44 of 80                                          
CONFIDENTIAL  
  A SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT (SAE) is any AE  or suspected adverse reaction  occurring 
at any dose that:  
 
• Results in death.  
• Is life -threatening. 
• Results in a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the 
ability to conduct normal life functions . 
• Requires inpatient hospitalization.  
• Prolongs inpatient hospitalization. 
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
• Is a significant medical event  (i.e., one that may jeopa rdize the subject or may 
require intervention to prevent one or more of the other outcomes listed above). 
 
A NON- SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT is any AE  that does not meet the definitions for 
SAE s as described above.  
 
Each  AE will be classified as SERIOUS or  NON- SERIOUS using the definitions provided 
above.  
The SEVERITY of each AE will be classified as MILD, MODERATE, or SEVERE.   
The Investigator will review each event and assess its RELATIONSHIP  to use of IP  
(unrelated, unlikely, possibly, probably, definitely). The AE  will be assessed using the 
following definitions : 
 Unrelated :  
• Event occurring before dosing.  
• Event or intercurrent illness due wholly to factors other than IP  use. 
 Unlikely :  
• Poor temporal relationship with IP  use. 
• Event easily explained by subject’s clinical state or other factors.  
 
Possible : 
 Reasonable temporal relationship with IP use. 
 Event could be explained by subject’s clinical state or other factors.  
 Probable:  
 Reasonable temporal relationship with IP use.

CONFIDENTIAL  
   Likely to be known reaction to agent or chemical group, or predicted by known 
pharmacology. 
 Event cannot easily be explained by subject’s clinical state or other factors.  
 
Definite:   
• Distinct temporal relationship with IP  use. 
• Known reaction to agent or chemical group, or predicted by known pharmacology. 
• Event cannot be explained by subject’s clinical state or other factors.   
 
8.3. PROCEDURES FOR AE REPORTING  BY THE INVESTIGATOR  
 
AEs will be monitored throughout the study and will be recorded on the e CRF with the date 
and time of onset, date and time of resolution, severity, seriousness, causality (relationship to use of IP ), treatment required , and the outcome.   
 To elicit AEs, simple questions with minimal suggestions or implications should be used as 
the initial questions at all evaluation points during the trial. For example:  
 
• How have you felt since your last assessment?  
• Have you had any health problems since your last assessment? 
 
The severity of each AE  should be categorized as mild, moderate, or severe. 
 
The causality of use of IP in relation to the AE  will be assessed by the P rincipal Investigator 
after careful medical consideration and categorized as  unrelated, unlikely, possible, probable, 
or definit e. 
 If an AE occurs, the Investigator will institute support and/or treat as deemed appropriate.   
If a non- SAE  is unresolved at the time of the last day of the study, an effort will be made to 
follow up until the AE is resolved or stabilized, the subject is lost to follow -up, or there is 
some other resolution of the event. The Investigator should make every attempt to follow SAE s to resolution. 
 8.4. S
ERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING  BY THE INVESTIGATOR  
 
Serious Adverse Event Reporting  
It is the responsibility of the Investigators or their designees to report any event of this nature 
to the Sponsor or a designee within 24 hours of the event being brought to the Investigators’

  9. STATISTICS  
9.1. STATISTICAL METHODS  
Continuous measures (e.g., age) will be summarized descriptively by the mean, standard 
deviation, median, minimum and maximum values. Categorical measures will be summarized 
by the number and percent of subjects. The statistical analyses will be performed in 
accordance with a formal Statistical Analysis Plan  (provided as a separate document). All 
study data will be listed by treatment, subject and visit (as applicable).  
9.2. ANALYSIS POPULATIONS  
The following analysis populations will be considered: 
Full Analysis Set (FAS) – The FAS includes all randomized subjects. The efficacy  analysis 
will be performed on the  FAS. Subjects in the FAS will b e analyzed as randomized.  
Per Protocol Set (PPS) – The PPS includes subjects in the FAS who do not have significant 
protocol deviations and who complete the study. Protocol deviations will be assessed prior to 
database lock and unmasking. The PPS will be analyzed using observed data only for efficacy variables. Subjects in the PPS will be analyzed as treated.  
Safety Set (SAF) – The SAF includes all randomized subjects who have received at  least one 
dose of the IP. The SAF will be analyzed for all safety  assessments. Subjects in the SAF will 
be analyzed as treated.   
The statistical analysis of safety data will be performed for the SAF. The analysis of baseline  
and efficacy data will be performed for the FAS. Sensitivity analyses may be performed on the PPS. 
9.3. S
UBJECT DISPOSITION , DEMOGRAPHIC AND BACKGROUND CHARACTERISTICS  
Subject disposition, demographic characteristics, and background variables will be 
summarized by treatment group. 
9.4. ANALYSIS OF  EFFICACY  
To assess whether AXR-270 Cream  is more effectiv e than Vehicle, exploratory efficacy will 
be performed . The unit of analysis for ophthalmic efficacy measures  depends on the measure 
itself. Some endpoints will be analyzed by eye whereas others will be analyzed by study 
eyelid, where study eye/eyelid are defined in Section 4.3.  
The following parameters will be assessed by eyelid:  
• Vascularity of eyelid margin  
• Total MGD Score  
• LGS grade

longitudinal model.  
All other paramete rs will be analyzed as categorical or discrete measures.  Frequencies and 
percentages of each category as well as a shift from baseline (Visit 2/Day 1) to each timepoint 
will be summarized.  
Analyses of all efficacy endpoints will be done using the FAS . Analyses on the study 
eye/eyelid will be repeated for all non -study eye/eyelids as supportive analyses.  Analyses may 
also be repeated on the PP S. 
9.5.  ANALYSIS OF SAFETY  
Analysis of safety data will be presented for all subjects in the Safety Population. AEs will  be 
coded using Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA, most current version) 
and categorized by system organ class using preferred terms. AEs will be tabulated by 
treatment group with respect to their Severity and relationship to the IP . Ophthalmoscopy 
findings will be summarized descriptively. IOP measurements, BCVA, dilated ophthalmoscopy, and slit-lamp biomicroscopy (including external eye exam) will be 
summarized as safety outcomes.

  APPENDIX 2:  DATA SAFETY REVIEW COMMITTEE (DSRC)  
A description of the function and membership of the masked DSRC will be detailed in 
a separate charter describing the agreed upon standard operating procedures. The 
general plan for the review and description of the committee is outlined here:  
• A review of  safety will be conducted by the DSRC after the last of those 15 
subjects has completed  Visit 4.  
• The DSRC will be minimally comprised of an independent O phthalmologist and a 
Statistician who are otherwise not involved in the conduct of the study. 
• The DSRC may request the participation of an independent S tatistician to assist in 
the assessment of the safety of the IP and the decision to continue enrolling 
subjects after the first 15 have been treated and have completed study procedures 
through Visit 4. 
• In order to maintain the integrity of the trial, unless it is absolutely necessary, the 
safety evaluation should be conducted using masked subject- specific information.  
• Upon review of the safety data obtained in the first 15 subjects in Cohort 1, the DSRC will issue a memorandum to Axero Vision , Inc. recommending one of the 
following:   
1. Continue with the low- dose Cohort 1 and expand study to high-dose Cohort 2 
upon completion of enrollment in Cohort 1. 
2. Continue with enrollment in the low-dose C ohort 1 but conduct an additional 
review of safety information from the next 15 subjects reaching the 2- week 
mid-point of the study before deciding to recommend escalation to  Cohort 2. 
3. Stop study due to safety concerns. 
• If, upon the review of the masked safety information, the DSRC requires unmasked information in order to ensure the safeguard of the interests of the study subjects, the unmasked information will be provided per the details outlined in the 
charter.  
• The DSRC will make every effort to arrive to a decision  by consensus.

  APPENDIX 3:   INVESTIGATOR -RATED ASSESSMENT OF SIGNS  OF MEIBOMIAN GLAND 
DYSFUNCTION  
 
The investigator will rate the bilateral severity of the subject’s MGD signs according to the 
following classification and for each eyelid:  
1. Total MGD Score  
A digital expression by applying pressure with thumb or forefinger will be used to express the meib omian gland of the UPPER eyelids. A cotton tip applicator is preferred but not required 
to evaluate the LOWER eyelids meibomian glands.  
The character of the secretion of 5 central glands on both the upper and lower eyelids will be evaluated for each eye. E ach of the glands will be scored from 0-3:  
0 = clear/slightly yellow  
1 = opaque/yellow, whitish, particulate 
2 = paste  
3 = none/occluded.  
The total score will thus range from 0 -15 for each eyelid. 
 
2. Eyelid Margin Vascularity  
0 = Normal – Typical vascularity for subject age  
1 = Mild vascular engorgement – Slightly dilated and pink blood vessels  2 = Moderate vascular engorgement – Slightly more dilated pink/red blood vessels  
3 = Severe vascular engorgement – Multiple significantly dilated red bloo d vessels  
4 = Very Severe vascular engorgement – Multiple significantly dilated deep red blood vessels   
3.  Bulbar Conjunctival Hyperemia  
Investigator- Rated Assessment of Bulbar conjunctival hyperemia  
Investigators will rate overall bulbar conjunctival hyperemia using the Cornea and Contact 
Lens Research Unit ( CCLRU) Grading Scale.

  APPENDIX 4:  ETDRS  BEST CORRECT ED VISUAL ACUITY  
 
Visual acuity testing should precede any examination requiring contact with the eye or 
instillation of study dyes, as is detailed in the order of assessments for each Visit in Section 5.1. Logarithm of the Minimal Angle of Resolution (LogMAR) visual acuity must be assessed 
using an ET DRS or modified ETDRS chart. Visual acuity testing should be performed with 
best correction using subject’s own corrective lenses (spectacles only) or pinhole refraction.  
An ETDRS or modified ETDRS chart may be used. If a Lighthouse chart is used (24.5” by 
25”; either reflectance or retro -illuminated), the subject must view the chart from a distance of 
exactly 4 meters (13.1 feet). If smaller reproductions (18” by 18”, e.g., Prevent Blindness) are used, the subject viewing distance should be exactly 10 feet . Reflectance wall charts should 
be frontally illuminated (60 watt bulb or a well -lit room).  
The subject should be positioned according to the elevation of the chart (either seated or standing) so that the chart is at a comfortable viewing angle. The right eye should be tested 
first. The subject should attempt to read each letter, line -by-line, left to right, beginning with 
line 1 at the top of the chart. The subject should be told that the chart has letters only, no numbers. If the subject reads a number, he or she should be reminded that the chart contains 
no numbers, and the examiner should then request a letter instead of the number. The subject 
should be asked to read slowly, about 1 letter per second, to achieve the best identification of 
each letter. He/she is not to proceed to the next letter until he/she has given a definite 
response. If the subject changes a response before he has read aloud the next letter, then the change must be accepted.  
Maximum effort should be made to identify each letter on the chart; the subject should be encouraged to guess. When it becomes evident that no further meaningful readings can be made, the examiner should stop the test. The number of letters missed or read incorrectly should be noted. 
In order to provide standardized and well -controlled assessments of visual acuity during the 
study, the same lighting conditions must be used consistently throughout the study.

  Calculations: LogMAR VA = Baseline value + (n X 0.02)  
where:   
the baseline value is the LogMAR  number of the last line read (at least 1 letter read

  APPENDIX 10:  TEAR BREAK -UP TIME (TBU T) 
TBUT will be measured at each visit. To measure TBUT, fluorescein is instilled into the 
subject’s  tear film, the subject is allowed to blink once or twice to disperse the fluorescein, 
after approximately 30 seconds  the subject is  then asked not to blink while the tear film is 
observed under a broad beam of cobalt blue illumination using a slit- lamp .   
Using a stopwatch the TBUT is recorded as the number of seconds that elapse between the last blink and the appearance of the first dry spot in the tear film. The time is measured to 
hundredth and using normal rounding rules, rounded to tenths. A TBUT under 10 seconds is 
considered abnormal.  
A total of 2 measurements are obtained and entered into the record. If the 2 measurements are 
> 2 seconds apart then a third measurement is obtained and the closest 2 measurements are 
recorded.  
NOTE:  The TBUT and the FCS may be performed right eye then left eye or staggered with 
the TBUT for the left eye being done during the waiting period before completing the FCS for 
the right eye.

APPENDIX 15:  EYELID  WIPE  INSTRUCTIONS  
 
Use 1 wipe to clean the eyelids of both eyes.  
The desired area to clean is the skin of the eyelids at the area of the eyelashes. 
Wash hands with soap and water, then dry hands. Open the packet containing the moistened wipe and place over the index finger of either hand. 
Gently close your eyelids. Forced, hard closure of the eyelids will prevent the wipe from 
cleaning the eyelash area of your eyelid.  
Using a back and forth motion gently wipe the skin of the eyelid and eye lash area for 
approximately 30 seconds. 
Use the underside of the wipe (portion of the wipe that was against the index finger) to clean 
the other eye. 
You may use the same hand or other hand to clean the other eye.

1 minute. 
• With the subject’s chin in the chinrest and the forehead against the forehead strap and 
evert the upper lid.  
•  Evaluate the lid margin anatomy starting with the Line of Marx. This should appear 
as a thin green line.  
• The width of Lid Wiper area does not have exact landmarks to identify its width on the palpebral conjunctival surface and the I nvestigator judgment is required to 
approximate the width. 
• The distal lid has rigidity due to the tarsal plate.  
• The Lid Wiper area extends proximally from the Line of Marx to the first curve in the 
conjunctival surface.

  APPENDIX 17: 
 
American Academy of Ophthalmology Recommended protocols when scheduling or 
seeing patients  
• If the office setup permits, patients who come to an appointment should be asked prior 
to entering the waiting room about fever and respiratory illness and whether they or a 
family member have had contact with another person with confirmed COVID-19 in 
the past 2 to 14 days. If they answer yes to either question, they should be sent home 
and told to speak to their primary care physician. 
• Keep the waiting room as empty as possible, advise seated patients to remain at least 6 
feet from one another. As much as prudent, reduce the visits of the most vulnerable 
patients.  
• The use of commercially available slit- lamp barriers  or breath shields  is enc ouraged, 
as they may provide a measure of added protection against the virus. These barriers do 
not, however, prevent contamination of equipment and surfaces on the patient's side of 
the barrier, which may then be touched by staff and other patients and lead to 
transmission. Homemade barriers may be more difficult to sterilize and could be a 
source of contamination. In general, barriers are not a substitute for careful cleaning 
of equipment between patients and asking those patients who cough, sneeze, or have 
flu-like symptoms to wear masks during examination. 
• To further decrease the risk of any virus transmission, ophthalmologists should inform 
their patients that they will speak as little as possible during the slit -lamp examination, 
and request that the p atient also refrain from talking.  
• For in -office procedures that require close physical proximity to the patient (e.g., 
intravitreal injection, lateral tarsorrhaphy), we recommend the patient wear a surgical 
mask or a cloth face covering  if surgical masks are in short supply, and that the 
surgeon wear a surgical mask and eye protection. In regions with high prevalence of 
COVID-19, an N95 mask for the surgeon can be considered when available. The 
CDC’s recommendations on  N95 extended use and/or reuse  should be followed.  
• The CMS and HHS have allowed for the expanded use of telehealth services during 
the COVID-19 public health crisis. For more information on telephone services, 
internet -based consultation or telemedicine exam, visit the Academy’s Coding for 
Phone Calls, Internet and Telehealth Consultations .

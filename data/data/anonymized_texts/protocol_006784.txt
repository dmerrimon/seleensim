BACKGROUND AND SCIENTIFIC JUSTIFICATION FOR CONDUCTING THE TRIAL  
The present trial is a  randomized, placebo -controlled, phase 3 trial designed to demonstrate the 
efficacy and safety of the human -derived recombinant follicle -stimulating hormone (rFSH) 
preparation FE  999049 in women aged 35-42 years undergoing controlled ovarian stimulation for  the 
development of multiple follicles for assisted reproductive technologies (ART). FE  999049 is 
expressed from a host cell line of human fetal retinal origin (PER.C6®), and is there by the first rFSH 
from a  human cell line. Ferring received marketing authorization approval for FE  999049 for the 
indication “Controlled ovarian stimulation for the development of multiple follicles in women 
undergoing assisted reproductive technologies (ART) such as an in vitro fertilisation (IVF) or 
intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) cycle” from the European Commission in 2016 . As of early

METHODOLOGY  
This will be a randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, parallel groups, multicenter trial 
assessing the efficacy and safety of  the rFSH preparation FE 999049  in subjects aged 35-42 years 
undergoing controlled ovarian stimulation for IVF / ICSI following a gonadotropin -releasing 
horm one (GnRH) antagonist protocol. The primary endpoint is the cumulative ongoing pregnancy 
rate after the fresh cycle and cryopreserved cycles initiated within 12  months from the start of 
controlled ovarian stimulation. Thereby, the trial is designed to capt ure the clinical efficacy of a 
single controlled ovarian stimulation cycle in a more complete manner by following outcomes from 
both the fresh and subsequent cryopreserved cycles. Secondary endpoints include pharmacodynamic 
parameters of FSH action as well  as efficacy and safety parameters related to controlled ovarian 
stimulation from the fresh cycle and subsequent cryopreserved cycles.  
 
Controlled Ovarian Stimulation and Fresh Cycle  
Subjects will be screened within 90 days prior to randomization for compl iance with the inclusion 
and exclusion criteria. On day 2 -3 of the menstrual cycle, subjects will be randomized in a 10:1 ratio 
to FE  999049 or placebo, and controlled ovarian stimulation will be initiated.  FE 999049 and 
placebo will be self -administered s ubcutaneously using a pre -filled injection pen.  
Subjects assigned to treatment with FE 999049 will receive a starting dose of 15 µg daily that is 
fixed for the first four stimulation days. Based on ovarian response , the dose may be adjusted by 
3 µg, with d ose increases implemented not more frequently than once every 2 days and dose 
decreases implemented per investigator’s judgement. The minimum daily dose is 6  µg, and the 
maximum daily dose is 24  µg. Subjects assigned to placebo will have the injection pen dialed to the 
same value (dose) as if administered FE 999049. Subjects can be treated with FE 999049 or placebo 
for a maximum of 20  days. Coasting, use of dopamine agonist or any other drug to prevent early 
ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) with the  exception of GnRH agonist for triggering  of 
final follicular maturation , are not allowed.  
During stimulation, subjects will be monitored by transvaginal ultrasound on stimulation days 1 and 
5 and thereafter at least every second day. When the leading foll icle reaches a diameter of ≥14  mm, 
transvaginal ultrasound will be performed daily. To prevent a premature luteinizing hormone (LH) 
surge, 250  µg GnRH antagonist (ganirelix acetate, GANIRELIX, Merck Sharp & Dohme) will be

fail to satisfy this GnRH antagonist criterion on stimulation day 5 will continue to be monitored at 
least every second day, and GnRH antagonist will be initiated  when /if the criterion is  met. The 
GnRH antagonist will be continued throughout the stimulation period. Triggering of final follicular 
maturati on will be done as soon as ≥2 follicles with a diameter of ≥17 mm are observed. If there are 
<20 follicles with a diameter of ≥12 mm, 10,000 IU human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG; 
NOVAREL, Ferring Pharmaceuticals ) will be administered. If there are ≥20  follicles with a diameter 
of ≥12 mm or the serum estradiol concentration is  ≥3,000 pg/mL  (local laboratory) , 4.0 mg GnRH 
agonist (leuprolide acetate, LEUPROLIDE ACETATE, Sandoz) will be administered, and the fresh 
blastocyst  transfer will be canceled. If after  8 days of stimulation, the investigator judges that the 
triggering criterion is not likely to be reached by day  20, the cycle will be canceled. If the triggering 
criterion is not met after 20 days of stimulation, the cycle will be canceled.  
Oocyte retrieval will take place 36h (±2h) after triggering of final follicular maturation, and oocytes 
will be inseminated by IVF or ICSI 4h (±1h) after retrieval. Rescue ICSI is not allowed. Fertilization 
and embryo development will be assessed. For subj ects who undergo triggering of final follicular 
maturation with hCG and have <20 oocytes retrieved, transfer will be performed on day 5 (blastocyst 
stage) after oocyte retrieval. Subjects will have one blastocyst transferred if at least one good -quality 
(i.e. grade 3BB or above) blastocyst is available, or one or two blastocysts transferred if no good -
quality blastocyst is available. Remaining blastocysts will be cryopreserved by vitrification. For 
subjects with ≥20 oocytes retrieved following hCG administr ation and for subjects who undergo 
triggering of final follicular maturation with GnRH agonist, no transfer will take place in the fresh 
cycle and blastocysts will instead be cryopreserved.  
A subject who fails to  reach the triggering criterion due to poor ovarian response or who has 
≤3 oocytes retrieved will be offered medication and financial support for an ART cycle with an 
approved gonadotropin preparation outside of the trial.  
Vaginal progesterone inserts (progesterone, ENDOMETRIN, Ferring  Pharmaceutica ls) 100  mg three 
times daily (TID) will be provided for luteal phase support from the day after oocyte retrieval and 
continuing until menses, negative  β human chorionic g onadotropin (βhCG  test), pregnancy loss or 
until ongoing pregnancy has been  documented . 
A serum βhCG test will be  performed 10 -14 days after transfer, clinical and vital pregnancy will be 
confirmed by transvaginal ultrasound 5 -6 weeks after transfer, and ongoing pregnancy will be 
confirmed by transvaginal or abdominal ultrasound 8-9 weeks after transfer.  
Blood samples will be collected for the purpose of evaluating the endocrine profile, clinical 
chemistry and hematology parameters as well as anti -FSH antibodies. Endocrine parameters will be  
assessed at screening, stimulation day 1, stimulation day 5, end-of-stimulation  and oocyte retrieval . 
Clinical chemistry and hematology will be  assessed at screening, end -of-stimulation , and end -of-
cycle. Anti -FSH antibodies will be  assessed on four occasions. The first sample will be  taken at the

The subsequent three samples will be  used for analysis of anti -FSH antibodies in individual subjects 
in the trial, and taken prior to dosing on stimu lation day 1 and on two occasions post -dosing: 
7-10 days after the last FE  999049 or placebo dose (this may coincide with the transfer visit) and 
21-28 days after the last FE  999049 or placebo dose (this may coincide with the βhCG test visit). 
Subjects wit h a treatment -induced anti -FSH antibody response will be followed until the response 
has become negative , returned to the pre -dosing level, or for a maximum of 1 year after the second 
post-dose sampling. These subjects will be called in for assessments 2  months after the last post -
dosing anti -FSH antibody sampling. If required, further assessments will be made at 3, 4, 6, 9 and 
12 months after the last post -dosing anti -FSH antibody sampling. The follow -up will also be 
terminated if the subject commences a n ew treatment cycle with any gonadotropin preparation.  
Local tolerability of FE 999049 and placebo following subcutaneous administration will be assessed 
by the subject three times daily:  immediately, 30  minutes and 24  hours after each injection. The 
presen ce and intensity of injection site reactions will be rated as none, mild, moderate or severe. The 
assessments will be made throughout the stimulation period and recorded by the subject in a diary.  
 
Cryopreserved Cycles  
The trial covers cryopreserved cycles  initiated within 12 months from the start of controlled ovarian 
stimulation.  Either a programmed or natural cycle can be selected for any cryopreserved cycle.  
Any p rogrammed cryopreserved cycle  will be initiated within 3 days of start of menses with 
administration of estradiol (ESTRA DIOL Tablets USP , Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. ) 2 mg TID 
or 3 mg two times daily ( BID) (or 3 mg TID at the investigator’s discretion , if a daily dose of 6  mg 
has been shown to be ins ufficient in a previous cycle) . If after 10 -12 days of estradiol treatment the 
endometrial thickness is ≥8  mm, the subject will initiate daily intramuscular  (IM)  injections of 
50 mg progesterone (PROGESTERONE Injection USP, West -ward Pharmaceutical Corp  or Watson 
Pharma, Inc. ) within the next 5 days in conjunction with the estradiol treatment. The ultrasound 
evaluation  can be repeated within 7 days if the endometrial thickness criterion is not met. In 
programmed cryopreserved cycles, transfer of one or two blastocyst s will occur on the 6th day from 
start of progesterone after warming and assessment of blastocyst survival and re -expansion. Subjects 
will have one blastocyst transferred if at least one good -quality (i.e. grade 3BB or above) blastocyst 
is availa ble, or one or two blastocysts transferred if no good -quality blastocyst is available. Luteal 
phase support (estradiol and IM progesterone) will continue to be administered until menses, 
negative βhCG test, pregnancy loss or until ongoing pregnancy has bee n documented.  
Any natural cryopreserved  cycle will be initiated 7 days after start of menses  with monitoring of 
urinary LH  on a daily basis by the subject . The day after confirmation of LH surge by serum LH 
(local laboratory)  and endometrial thickness of ≥8  mm, the subject  will start luteal phase support

+7 after warming and assessment of blastocyst survival and re -expansion. Subjects will have one 
blastocyst transferred if at least one good -quality (i.e. grade 3BB or above) blastocyst is available, or 
one or two blastocysts transferred if no good -qualit y blastocyst is available. Luteal phase support 
(vaginal progesterone) will continue to be administered until menses, negative  βhCG test, pregnancy 
loss or until ongoing pregnancy has been documented.  
Failure to achieve endometrial thickness ≥8 mm in the f irst cryopreserved cycle will result in cycle 
cancel lation, and in the programmed cycles, administration of 100 mg IM progesterone 
(PROGESTERONE Injection USP, West -ward Pharmaceutical Corp  or Watson Pharma, Inc. ) to 
induce withdrawal bleeding. In subseque nt cryopreserved cycles, b lastocyst transfer can take place 
regardless of endometrial thickness at the investigator’s discretion .  
In both programmed and natural cryopreserved cycles, a serum βhCG test is performed 10 -14 days 
after transfer, clinical and v ital pregnancy will be confirmed by transvaginal ultrasound 5 -6 weeks 
after transfer, and ongoing pregnancy will be confirmed by transvaginal or abdominal ultrasound 
8-9 weeks after transfer.  
After completion of the trial, the subject is allowed to use cry opreserved blastocysts in accordance 
with local guidelines and/or regulations.  
 
Post-trial Activities  
Post-trial activities cover pregnancy and neonatal health follow -up after the fresh cycle and 
cryopreserved cycles.  
All subjects with an ongoing pregnancy  obtained in the fresh cycle or in cryopreserved cycles 
initiated within 12  months from the start of controlled ovarian stimulation will be followed until 
delivery to collect information on live birth rate. Furthermore, data will be collected on neonatal 
health, including minor/major congenital anomalies, at birth, 4 weeks and 1 year after birth.  
 
Optional Exploratory Analyses  
For subjects who have provided a separate informed consent, a blood sample and a saliva sample for 
potential future genome sequencing will be collected on stimulation day 1, and a tongue coat sample 
for potential future microbial profiling will be collected on stimulation day 1 and at the transfer 
visit(s) in the fresh and cryopreserved cycles, as applicable.

STATISTICAL METHODS  
The primary objective of this trial is to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of FE  999049 in 
controlled ovarian stimulation . 
 
Sample Size  
The proposed sample size of 550 subjects (FE  999049:placebo = 500:50) can adequately address 
both the efficacy and safety objectives of the trial:  
• The cumulative ongoing pregnancy rate in the FE  999049 -treated subjects aged 35 -42 years 
is estimated to be approximately 30% according to results from clinical trials conducted in

Ferring Pharmaceuticals  CONFIDENTIAL  the U.S. By comparison, the pregnancy rate in the placebo arm is expected n ot to exceed 3%, 
the monthly spontaneous pregnancy rate in infertile women. Therefore, the proposed sample 
size of 550 (FE 999049: placebo = 500:50) will provide at least 99% power for the primary 
efficacy comparison.  Based on the estimated cumulative ongoi ng pregnancy rate, the 
cumulative live birth rate from the fresh and/or cryopreserved cycles is estimated to be 
approximately 27%, resulting in a power for the comparison of the cumulative live birth rate 
to be at least 99%.  
• A key pharmacodynamic parameter  in subjects aged 35 -42 years is cycle cancellation due to 
poor follicular development, which may occur in approximately 5% of the population 
exposed to gonadotropins.  
• The safety and tolerability of daily rFSH preparations as part of an ART treatment cycl e have 
been well documented for the population  studied  in previous clinical trials. OHSS was 
reported to occur in 1.7% to 3.7% of the subjects, with moderate/severe OHSS occurring in 
1.4% to 2.2% of the subjects. Other adverse events were pelvic pain, pelv ic discomfort and 
headache, with those assessed to be related to trial treatments reported in 1.5% to 7.1% of the 
subjects.  
Table 1 shows that the planned sample size of 500 subjects exposed to FE  999049 provides a 
high probability to detect a rare adverse  event or safety signal occu rring in 0.5% or more 
subjects:

Ferring Pharmaceuticals  CONFIDENTIAL   Primary Endpoint  
The hypothesis to be tested for the primary endpoint , cumulative ongoing pregnancy rate,  is: 
H0: πFE 999049  – πPlacebo  ≤ 0 against the alternative H A: πFE 999049  – πPlacebo  > 0, 
where π FE 999049  and π Placebo  denote the cumulative ongoing pregnancy rate after the fresh cycle and 
cryopreserved cycles in subjects aged 35-42 years treated with FE  999049 or placebo, respectively.  
H0 will be tested against the alternative H A by constructing  a two -sided 95% confiden ce interval for 
the difference in the cumulative ongoing pregnancy rates between the two treatment groups using the 
traditional Wald interval. If the lower limit of the two -sided 95% confidence interval is greater than 
0, the null hypothesis H 0 will be rej ected. In the case that the number of pregnancies observed in the 
placebo group is small (<5), then the one -sided Fisher’s exact test will be used.  
The primary endpoint  will be determined as soon as the subject has achieved an ongoing pregnancy, 
or when al l cryopreserved blastocysts have been exhausted, or after assessment of ongoing 
pregnancy status in cryopreserved cycles initiated within 12 months from  the start of controlled 
ovarian stimulation.  
The efficacy analysis will be based on the modified intention -to-treat (mITT) analysis set, defined as 
all subjects who were  randomized and received at least one dose of IMP (FE  999049 or placebo).

Ferring Pharmaceuticals  CONFIDENTIAL  1 INTRODUCTION  
1.1 Background  
FE 999049 is a hum an recombinant follicle -stimulating hormone (rFSH) belonging to the 
pharmaceutical class of gonadotropins. The current trial is intended to support the following indication  
being pursued for FE 999049 in the United States ( U.S.): “Development of multiple follicles and 
pregnancy after fresh and/or cryopreserved embryo transfer in ovulatory women undergoing assisted 
reproductive technology (ART)”.  
FE 999049 is expressed from a host cell line of human fetal retinal origin (PER.C6®). The PER.C6® 
cell line is well -characterized , and bio -testing of the master cell bank has demonstrated safety and 
consistency. FE  999049 is a glycoprotein which is composed of two non -covalently bound polypeptide 
chains, denoted alfa (α) and beta (β). The  α-subunit contains 92 amino acid residues with 5 intrachain -
disulphide bonds. The β -subunit contains 111 amino acid residues with 6  intrachain -disulphide bonds. 
Each subunit is N -glycosylated at two positions, and about 40% of the total mass is carbohydra tes. 
Ferring received marketing authorization approval for FE  999049 for the indication “Controlled 
ovarian stimulation for the development of multiple follicles in women undergoing assisted 
reproductive technologies (ART) such as an in vitro fertilisation  (IVF) or intracytoplasmic sperm 
injection (ICSI) cycle”  from the European Commission in 2016 . As of early 2018, FE 999049 is 
approved in 37 countries also including countries outside the Europe an Union  (EU) such as Australia, 
Switzerland , and Canada . 
Ther e are no commercially available rFSH products derived from human cell lines in the  U.S. The 
rFSH products currently approved in the U.S. for controlled ovarian stimulation in ovulatory women 
undergoing ART, e.g. follitropin alfa (GONAL -F, EMD Serono) and f ollitropin beta (FOLLISTIM, 
Merck), are derived from a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line. The amino acid sequence of 
FE 999049 is identical to the endogenous human FSH sequence and to that in existing CHO -derived 
rFSH products. Manufacturing from diffe rent cell systems leads to glycosylation heterogeneity 
between rFSH preparations. The glycosylation profile of recombinant proteins is dependent on the 
expressing cell line and the cell culture conditions. Differences in glycosylation profile, sialic acid 
pattern and isoform profile have been documented between FE  999049 and existing rFSH products 
from a CHO cell line. Comparison between the FE  999049 and the GONAL -F and FOLLISTIM 
profiles indicate differences in acidity and carbohydrate side chains. As CHO  cells lack enzymatic 
functions to construct more complex carbohydrate structures found in humans, the glycosylation 
profile of FE  999049 is more complex. In addition, FE  999049 contains both α2,3 and α2,6 sialylation 
patterns, while CHO -derived rFSH produ cts exclusively carry 2,3 linked sialic acid; this difference 
further contributes to the observed differences in glycosylation profiles between FE  999049 and CHO -
derived rFSH products.  For the purpose of clinical trials, FE 999049 is being treated as a new  
molecular entity (NME)  by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) .

Clinical Trial Protocol  
Ferring Pharmaceuticals  CONFIDENTIAL  In total, eight  previous clinical trials have been completed as part of the development program for 
FE 999049, covering four phase 1 trials, two pha se 2 trials (one conducted in EU and one in Japan) and 
two phase  3 trials. A total of 1,927 subjects were included in these trials, of whom 1,112 subjects were 
exposed to FE  999049, in a range from a single dose up to exposure in three consecutive stimulat ion 
cycles. During the phase 3 trials, 665 IVF/ICSI patients were treated with FE  999049 in 1,012 
treatment cycles. In addition, two phase 3 trials are currently ongoing; one in Japan and one in Pan -
Asia.  
The two completed phase 3 trials support the effic acy and safety of FE  999049 (ESTHER -1 / 
ESTHER -2: Evidence -based Stimulation Trial with Human rFSH in Europe and Rest of World). 
ESTHER -1 (Trial 000004)1 was a randomized, controlled, assessor -blind trial conducted in 11 
countries in women 18 -40 years und ergoing IVF/ICSI  followed predominantly by single blastocyst 
transfer . The trial was designed to demonstrate non -inferiority of FE  999049 versus an approved 
recombinant FSH preparation (GONAL -F) with ongoing pregnancy rate and ongoing implantation rate 
as co-primary e ndpoints and also to prospectively evaluate the outcome of an individualized 
FE 999049 dosing regimen based on the serum anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) concentration 
(measured by Elecsys® AMH Immunoassay, Roche Diagnostics) and body weight. The E STHER -1 
trial demonstrated non -inferiority of FE  999049 to GONAL -F for ongoing pregnancy rate and ongoing 
implantation rate for both the per -protocol (PP) and modified intention -to-treat (mITT ; randomized and 
exposed ) populations. For the overall trial pop ulation randomized and exposed to FE  999049, the 
ongoing pregnancy rate was 30.7% and the ongoing implantation rate was 35.2%. Among the women 
aged ≥35  years, the ongoing pregnancy rate with FE 999049 was 26.9% and the ongoing implantation 
rate was 30.9%. ESTHER -2 (Trial 000071)2 was a safety immunogenicity trial covering up to two 
repeated treatment cycles in subjects who did not achieve an ongoing pregnancy in ESTHER -1. The 
trial confirmed the low immunogenicity  potential with incidences of ant i-FSH antibodies after 
exposure to FE 999049  of 0.8% in cycle 2 and 1.1% in cycle 3, which was not higher than the 
incidence of 1.1% in cycle 1 (ESTHER -1) or the incidence of pre -existing anti -FSH antibodies before 
exposure to FE  999049 , which was 1.4% .2 ESTHER -2 furthermore documented the efficacy of 
FE 999049 in repeated cycles with similar ong oing pregnancy rates between FE  999049 and 
GONAL -F as well as documented the safety of FE  999049 in an extended dose range up to 24 µg 
daily.  Cryopreserved cycles using blastocysts derived from the controlled ovarian stimulation cycle in 
ESTHER -1 or ESTHER -2 and initiated within 1 year after start of stimulation in the subject’s last 
stimulatio n cycle  were followed and showed good efficacy  of FE 999049 in cryopreserved cycles with 
an ongoing pregnancy rate of 32.3%  per initiated cycle .

Clinical Trial Protocol  
Ferring Pharmaceuticals  CONFIDENTIAL  1.2 Scientific Justification for Conducting the Trial  
A clin ical development program for FE  999049 has been conducted outside the U.S. applying an 
individualized dosing regimen based on the patient’s serum AMH concentration and body  weight , and 
with a fixed dose throughout stimulation . As per FDA recommendations, the FE  999049 dosing 
regimen in phase  3 in the U.S. will not be based on AMH and body weight. Consequently, a phase 3 
program is required for the U.S. to document the effica cy and safety of FE 999049 in the dosing 
regimen applied in the present trial (see section  3.5.4 ). The present phase 3 trial will be conducted in 
the U.S.  and will meet the FDA requirements of exposure in the intended target population in the U.S.  
The trial is designed to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of FE  999049 in women aged 35-42 years 
undergoing controlled ovarian stimulation for the development of multiple follicles and pregnancy 
after fresh and/or cryopreserved cycles.  
Cryopreservation  of surplus embryos for potential use after the fresh cycle is standard practice in ART 
treatment, and serves to improve chances of pregnancy from a single stimulation cycle. The 
development of the vitrification method for freezing of embryos has resulted in significant 
improvement in post -thaw embryo survival4,5 with resulting ongoing pregnancy rates at least as good 
as those from fresh embryo transfer.6,7 As a consequence, the percentage of transfer cycles involving 
cryopreserved embryos has steadily increased in the U.S. over the last years, with a doubling from 
26.6% in 2011 to 52.4% in 2015.8,9 The higher frequency of cryopreserved cycles also reflect s an 
increase of “cryo -all” cycles (ovarian stimulation cycles with cryopreservation of all embryos), which 
when coupled to a gonadotropin -releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist trigger improves patient safety, by 
reducing the risk of early severe ovarian hypers timulation syndrome (OHSS).10 With the observed 
higher proportion of cryopreserved cycles, it becomes increasingly relevant to include these cycles in 
the assessment of pregnancy outcome following controlled ovarian stimulation. The present trial is the 
first U.S. clinical registration trial with a cumulative endpoint covering outcomes from both the fresh 
and subsequent cryopreserved cycles and thus capturing the clinical efficacy of a single controlled 
ovarian stimulation cycle in a more complete manner.  
The primary endpoint of cumulative ongoing pregnancy rate will be based on the fresh cycle and 
cryopreserved cycles initiated within 12  months of the start of controlled ovarian stimulation. The 
cumulative nature of the primary endpoint selected for this tr ial reflects the evolution in clinical 
management of infertility. Contemporary approach es have also been applied to improve the safety of 
infertility treatment, with implementation of GnRH agonist triggering in patients with excessive 
response to reduce th e risk of OHSS as well as implementation of a restrictive transfer policy guided 
by blastocyst quality and limited to no more than double blastocyst transfer to minimize the incidence  
of multiple gestation, thereby addressing the most common safety concern s.

Benefits  
Subjects who participate in this trial will undergo fertility screening procedures useful for their future 
clinical management. They will also be closely monitored and may benefit by achieving pregnancy.  If 
subjects exh ibit poor response to therapy (pre -established protocol criteria) , they will be offered 
medication and financial support for an ART cycle with an approved gonadotropin preparation outside 
of the trial.  
 
Risks  
The risks associated with ART treatment, including the risks associated with controlled ovarian 
stimulation and clinical and laboratory procedures, are explained to the subjects as part of the 
counselling prior to starting tre atment.  
FE 999049  
In the completed clinical trials of the de velopment program for  FE 999049, covering four phase  1 
trials, two phase 2 trials and two phase  3 trials, a total of 1,927  subjects  were included. Of these, 
1,112  subjects were exposed to FE  999049 in a range from a single dose up to exposure in three 
consecutive stimulation cycles. During the phase 3 trials, 665  IVF/ICSI subjects were treated with 
FE 999049 in 1,012 treatment cycles. The most frequently reported adverse drug reactions during 
1,012 treatment cycles with FE  999049 in the phase 3 program were  headache, pelvic discomfort, 
OHSS, pelvic pain, adnexa uteri pain, nausea and fatigue (all reported as common, i.e. 1% to <10%). 
Uncommon adverse drug reactions reported with FE  999049 were diarrhea , dizziness, mood swings, 
constipation, vomiting, abdomin al discomfort, breast pain, breast tenderness, vagina l hemorrhage and 
somnolence. The incidence of injection site reactions was  low after administration of FE  999049, and 
the severity of the injection site reactions was in general mild and comparable to th at observed  for 
GONAL -F. 
Concerning well -known risks associated with the use of gonadotropin products for  controlled  ovarian 
stimulation, subjects are closely monitored throughout the trial. The most serious risk associated with 
gonadotropin treatment is O HSS. OHSS manifests itself with increasing degrees of severity. 
Moderate/severe OHSS is associated with marked ovarian enlargement, fluid accumulation and other 
complications. The incidence of early OHSS can be minimized by withholding gonadotropins, 
withh olding human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) or administering GnRH  agonist for triggering of 
final follicular maturation. In the current trial , a GnRH agonist will be administered for triggering of 
final follicular maturation in subjects who might be at risk of OHSS (as per defined criteria) , and 
transfer in the fresh cycle will be cancelled . In addition, subjects with excessive ovarian response after 
triggering with hCG (as per defined criteria) will also have transfer in the fresh cycle cancelled  to

will be cryopreserved. Very rare cases of serious allergic reactions have been reported after injection of 
gonadotropins. Concerning immunogenicity, the risk of trea tment -induced anti -drug-antibodies 
following FE  999049 treatment is very low . In the ESTHER -1 and ESTHER -2 trials, the observed 
incidence of anti -FSH antibodies after treatment with FE  999049 was  1.1%  in cycle 1 , 0.8% in cycle 2 
and 1.1% in cycle 3 , which was not higher than the incidence of pre-existing anti-FSH antibodies of 
1.4% before exposure of FE  999049.2 In all instances , titers were u ndetectable  or very low and without 
neutrali zing capacity. No safety or efficacy concern has been identified with regard to immunogenicity 
with FE  999049 .  
Concomitant Fertility Medications  
Subjects will receive concomitant fertility medication as part of the fresh cycle and the cryopreserved 
cycles in this trial.  The most frequently reported adverse events with GnRH antagonist and hCG 
products are similar to those reported for FSH  preparations  and include  headache, injection site 
reactions, pelvic pain, abdominal pain, abdominal distension and allergic reactions . Further,  similar  
adverse events are expected after a single injection of GnRH agonist . Use of progesterone can cause 
skin reactions, fluid retent ion, somnolence, and arterial and venous thromboembolic events, including 
retinal thrombosis. Furthermore, the vaginal progesterone has been associated with vulvovaginal 
disorders and uterine spasms (at a frequency of 1 -2%). Intramuscular  progesterone can cause injection 
site reactions and sterile abscesses. Estrogen can cause breast tenderness, nausea, vomiting, skin 
reactions, headache, anaphylactic reactions, increase in blood pressure, and arterial and venous 
thromboembolic events, including retinal thr ombosis.  For detailed information on  adverse events , 
please refer to the respe ctive  products Prescribing Information . 
Procedures  
Subjects will undergo standard ART treatment procedures (e.g. transvaginal ultrasound, blood 
sampling, oocyte retrieval and transfer). The transvaginal ultrasound examinations may be associated 
with mild discomfort and a very rare risk of infection. The blood sampling might be associated with 
mild discomfort, bruising and a very rare risk of infection. The oocyte retrieval procedure is associated 
with discomfort and very rarely infections and bleeding. The transfer procedure is associated with mild 
discomfort and very rarel y infections and mild bleeding.  
Pregnancy -related Events  
Oocytes will be inseminated using IVF or ICSI and subsequently cultured to blastocyst stage  (day 5 or 
later depending on embryo development ). Although the frequency of cancellation of transfer is higher 
when culturing to blastocyst stage compared to cultur ing only to cleavage stage, the pregnancy rates 
per started cycle are at least as good with blastocyst transfer as with cleavage embryo transfer11 and 
may even be higher.12 A serious concern associated with ART cycles is the frequency of multiple

gestations, a restrictive transfer policy guided by blastocyst quality and limited to no more than double 
blastocyst transfer in both the fresh and the cryopreserve d cycles is mandatory in this trial. The 
incidence of miscarriage and ectopic pregnancy is higher in women undergoing controlled ovarian 
stimulation than in women conceiving spontaneously, though the risk of ectopic pregnancy is mainly 
higher in women with  a history of tubal infertility. Furthermore, the prevalence of congenital 
malformations after ART may be slightly higher than after spontaneous conceptions; this is thought to 
be due to differences in parental characteristics (e.g. maternal age , maternal and paternal genetic 
background,  and sperm characteristics) and multiple pregnancies.  
 
Benefits / Risks  
Participation in this trial does not create extra risks for the subjects  compared to routine controlled 
ovarian stimulation . The majority of subjects w ill receive active treatment, with an expected likelihood 
of conceiving similar to that in standard clinical practice. Subjects who exhibit poor response to 
therapy as per pre -established protocol criteria will be offered medication and financial support f or an 
ART cycle with an approved gonadotropin preparation outside of the trial . In conclusion, the 
evaluation of benefits and risks indicate that participation in this trial is associated with a favorable  
benefit -risk ratio.

 Overall Design and Control Methods  
This will be a randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, parallel groups, multicenter trial assessing 
the efficacy and safety of the rFSH preparation FE  999049 in subjects aged 35-42 years undergoing 
controlled ovarian stimulation for IVF / ICSI following a GnRH antagonist protocol. The primary 
endpoint is the cumulative ongoing pregnancy rate after the fresh cycle and cryopreserved cycles 
initiated within 12  months from the start of control led ovarian stimulation. Thereby, the trial is 
designed to capture the clinical efficacy of a single controlled ovarian stimulation cycle in a more 
complete manner by following outcomes from both the fresh and subsequent cryopreserved cycles. 
Secondary end points include pharmacodynamic parameters of FSH action as well as efficacy and 
safety parameters related to controlled ovarian stimulation from the fresh cycle and subsequent 
cryopreserved cycles.  
 
Controlled Ovarian Stimulation and Fresh Cycle  
Subjects w ill be screened within 90 days prior to randomization for compliance with the inclusion and 
exclusion criteria. On day 2 -3 of the menstrual cycle, subjects will be randomized in a 10:1 ratio to 
FE 999049 or placebo, and controlled ovarian stimulation will be initiated.  FE 999049 and placebo will 
be self -administered subcutaneously using a pre -filled injection pen.  
Subjects assigned to treatment with FE 999049 will receive a starting dose of 15 µg daily that is fixed 
for the first four stimulation days. Base d on ovarian response , the dose may be adjusted by 3  µg, with

implemented per investigator’s judgement. The minimum daily dose is 6  µg, and the maximum daily 
dose is 2 4 µg. Subjects assigned to placebo will have the injection pen dialed to the same value (dose) 
as if administered FE 999049. Subjects can be treated with FE 999049 or placebo for a maximum of 
20 days. Coasting, use of dopamine agonist or any other drug to prevent early OHSS with the 
exception of GnRH agonist for triggering  of final follicular maturation , are not allowed.  
During stimulation, subjects will be monitored by transvaginal ultrasound on stimulation days 1 and 5 
and thereafter at least every second  day. When the leading fol licle reaches a diameter of ≥14  mm, 
transvaginal ultrasound will be performed daily. To prevent a premature luteinizing hormone (LH) 
surge, 250  µg GnRH antagonist (ganirelix acetate, GANIRELIX, Merck Sharp & Dohme) will be 
initiat ed on stimulation day 5 for subjects with ≥3 follicles with a diameter of ≥10 mm. Subjects who 
fail to satisfy this GnRH antagonist criterion on stimulation day 5 will continue to be monitored at least 
every second day, and GnRH antagonist will be initiate d when /if the criterion is met . The GnRH 
antagonist will be continued throughout the stimulation period. Triggering of final follicular maturation 
will be done as soon as ≥2 follicles with a diameter  of ≥17 mm are observed. If there are <20 follic les 
with a diameter of ≥12 mm, 10,000 IU hCG  (NOVAREL, Ferring Pharmaceuticals ) will be  
administered. If there are ≥20  follicles with a diameter  of ≥12 mm or the serum estradiol  concentration 
is ≥3,000 pg/mL  (local laboratory) , 4.0 mg GnRH agonist (leuprolide acetate, LEUPROLIDE 
ACETATE, Sandoz) will be administered, and the fresh blastocyst transfer will be canceled. If after 
8 days of stimulation, the investigator judges that the triggering criterion is not likely to be reached by 
day 20, the cycle will be canceled. If the triggering criterion is not met after 20 days of stimulation, the 
cycle will be canceled.  
Oocyte retrieval will take place 36h (±2h) after triggering of final follicular maturation, and oocytes 
will be inseminate d by IVF or ICSI 4h (±1h) after retrieval. Rescue ICSI is not allowed. Fertilization 
and embryo development will be assessed. For subjects who undergo triggering of final follicular 
maturation with hCG and have <20 oocytes retrieved, transfer will be perfo rmed on day 5 (blastocyst 
stage) after oocyte retrieval. Subjects will have one blastocyst transferred if at least one good -quality 
(i.e. grade 3BB or above) blastocyst is available, or one or two blastocysts transferred if no good -
quality blastocyst is av ailable. Remaining blastocysts will be cryopreserved by vitrification. For 
subjects with ≥20 oocytes retrieved following hCG administration and for subjects who undergo 
triggering of final follicular maturation with GnRH agonist, no transfer will take plac e in the fresh 
cycle and blastocysts will instead be cryopreserved.  
A subject who fails to reach the triggering criterion due to poor ovarian response or who has 
≤3 oocytes retrieved will be offered medication and financial support for an ART cycle with an  
approved gonadotropin preparation outside of the trial.

confirmed by transvaginal or abdominal ultrasound 8 -9 weeks after transfer.  
Blood sample s will be collected for the purpose of evaluating the endocrine profile, clinical chemistry 
and hematology parameters as well as anti -FSH antibodies. Endocrine parameters will be  assessed at 
screening, stimulation day 1, stimulation day 5, end-of-stimulati on and oocyte retrieval . Clinical

FSH antibodies will be  assessed on four occasions. The first sample will be  taken at the screening visit 
and will be  used exclusively to re -establish the anti -drug antibody analytical assays. The subsequent 
three samples will be  used for analysis of anti -FSH antibodies in individual subjects in the trial, and 
taken prior to do sing on stimulation day 1 and on  two occasions post -dosing: 7 -10 days after the last

induced anti -FSH antibod y response will be followed until the response has become negative , returned 
to the pre -dosing level, or for a maximum of 1 year after the second post -dose sampling. These 
subjects will be called in for assessments 2  months after the last post -dosing anti -FSH antibody 
sampling. If required, further assessments will be made at 3, 4, 6, 9 and 12  months after the last post -
dosing anti -FSH antibody sampling. The follow -up will also be terminated if the subject commences a 
new treatment cycle with any gonadotrop in preparation.  
Local tolerability of FE 999049 and placebo following subcutaneous administration will be assessed by 
the subject three times daily: immediately, 30 minutes and 24 hours after each injection. The presence 
and intensity of injection site rea ctions will be rated as none, mild, moderate or severe. The 
assessments will be made throughout the stimulation period and recorded by the subject in a diary . 
 
Cryopreserved Cycles  
The trial covers cryopreserved cycles initiated within 12 months from the s tart of controlled ovarian

progesterone (PROGESTERONE Injection USP, West -ward Pharmaceutical Corp  or Watson Pharma, 
Inc.) within the next 5  days in conjunction with the estradio l treatment. The ultrasound evaluation  can 
be repeated within 7  days if the endometrial thickness criterion is not met. In programmed 
cryopreserved cycles, transfer of one or two blastocyst s will occur on the 6th day from start of 
progesterone after warmin g and assessment of blastocyst survival and re -expansion. Subjects will have 
one blastocyst transferred if at least one good -quality (i.e. grade 3BB or above) blastocyst is available, 
or one or two blastocysts transferred if no good -quality blastocyst is a vailable. Luteal phase support 
(estradiol and IM progesterone) will continue to be administered until menses, negative βhCG test, 
pregnancy loss or until ongoing pregnancy has been documented.  
Any natural cryopreserved cycle will be initiated 7 days after start of menses with monitoring of 
urinary LH on a daily basis by the subject. The day after confirmation of LH surge by serum LH (local 
laboratory) and endometrial thickness of ≥8 mm, the subject will start luteal phase support with vaginal 
progesterone i nserts (progesterone, ENDOMETRIN, Fer ring Pharmaceuticals ) 100 mg  TID. In a 
natural cryopreserved cycle, transfer of one or two blastocyst s will occur on day LH surge +7 after 
warming and assessment of blastocyst survival and re -expansion. Subjects will ha ve one blastocyst 
transferred if at least one good -quality (i.e. grade 3BB or above) blastocyst is available, or one or two 
blastocysts transferred if no good -quality blastocyst is available. Luteal phase support (vaginal 
progesterone) will continue to be administered until menses, negative βhCG test, pregnancy loss or 
until ongoing pregnancy has been documented.  
Failure to achieve endometrial thickness ≥8 mm in the first cryopreserved cycle will result in cycle 
cancel lation, and in the programmed cycles, administration of 100 mg IM progesterone 
(PROGESTERONE Injection USP, West -ward Pharmaceutical Corp  or Watson Pharma, Inc. ) to 
induce withdrawal bleeding. In subsequent cryopreserved cycles, blastocyst transfer can take place 
regardless of endometrial thickness at the investigator’s discretion.  
In both programmed and natural cryopreserved cycles, a serum βhCG test is performed 10 -14 days 
after transfer, clinical and vital pregnancy will be confirmed by transvaginal u ltrasound 5 -6 weeks after 
transfer, and ongoing pregnancy will be confirmed by transvaginal or abdominal ultrasound 8 -9 weeks 
after transfer.  
After completion of the trial, the subject is allowed to use cryopreserved blastocysts in accordance with 
local gu idelines and/or regulations.

Ferring Pharmaceuticals  CONFIDENTIAL  3.5 Discussion of Overall Trial Design and Choice of Control Groups  
 Trial Design  
The trial is designed to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of FE  999049 in controlled ovarian 
stimulation, taking into account the clinical outcome of the blastocysts transferred in the fresh cycle 
and subsequent cryopreserved cycles initiated within 12  months from start of controlled ovarian 
stimulation.  It is the first U.S. clinical registration trial  with a cumulative endpoint covering outcomes 
from both the fresh and subsequent cryopreserved cycles  and thus  capturing the clinical efficacy of  a 
single controlled ovarian stimulation cycle in a more complete manner.  Contemporary approaches have 
also been applied to improve the safety of infertility treatment, with implementation of GnRH agonist 
triggering in patients with excessive response to r educe the risk of OHSS as well as implementation of 
a restrictive transfer policy guided by blastocyst quality and limited to transfer of no more than two 
blastocyst to minimize  the incidence  of multiple gestation, thereby addressing the most common safety  
concerns.  
The trial  is a randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled trial. The double -blind, placebo -controlled 
clinical trial has a long history as  the standard for investigations of new drugs in the U.S ., including 
those for the treatment of infertility (ClinicalTrials.gov [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]). Moreover, the placebo 
response has not been rigorously characterized in the indicated trial population  undergoing ART . A 
placebo solution has been manufactured for the purpose of this trial; it is indistinguishable from the 
active FE  999049 solution and is provided in identical pre-filled injection pens. Only placebo to 
FE 999049 is used in the trial and N IMPs will be supplied to subjects both in the placebo and 
FE 999049 treatment groups as per protocol description , facilitat ing a focused comparison of 
FE 999049 versus placebo to FE  999049. Clinical considerations have been made to maximize the 
probability  for pregnancy in the placebo group, including that the criterion for starting the GnRH 
antagonist is based on follicular development and not fixed to a specific stimulation day. It will not be 
possible to distinguish between poor responders to FE  999049 a nd women in the placebo group, which 
supports the double -blinded design.  
The double -blind design will  ensure that the subjects, the investigator and other trial staff such as trial 
nurses, ultrasound technicians , local laboratory technicians  and embryolog ists, as well as central 
laboratory personnel are blinded to individual treatment allocation throughout the trial, including the 
post-trial activities. Sponsor  staff will also remain blinded to individual subject treatment allocation 
during the conduct of the trial.  
The trial will be a multi -center trial. This set -up ensures that the required number of subjects can be 
recruited within a reasonable time and also has the advantage that it should facilitate subsequent 
generalization of the results.

Clinical Trial Protocol  
Ferring Pharmaceuticals  CONFIDENTIAL  The trial c overs a f resh cycle and cryopreserved cycles initiated within 12 months from the start of 
controlled ovarian stimulation. Subjects will undergo controlled ovarian stimulation in a GnRH 
antagonist prot ocol with either FE  999049 or placebo . Subjects randomiz ed to FE  999049  will receive 
a starting dose of 15  µg daily that is fixed for the first four stimulation days. Based on  ovarian 
response , the dose may be adjusted by 3  µg, with dose increases implemented not more frequently than 
once every 2  days and dose decreases implemented per investigator’s judgement. The minimum daily 
dose is 6  µg, and the maximum daily dose is 24  µg. For subjects randomized  to placebo the injection 
pen will be dialed to the same value (dose) as if administered FE  999049 . The selection of FE 999049 
starting dose and dose adjustments  is desc ribed in detail in section  3.5.4 .  
Oocytes will be inseminated by either IVF or ICSI reflecting the procedures used in the target 
population for the proposed indication , and e mbryo development parameters will be assessed. 
Blastocyst biopsy, assisted hatching, and preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) / preimplantation 
genetic screening (PGS) are not allowed . 
The present protocol has a restrictive transfer policy guided by blastocyst quality and limited to no 
more than double blastocyst transfer in both the fresh and the cryopreserved cycles. These criteria are 
stricter  than the current American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) guidelines  for embryo 
transfer but is justifiable to reduce the risk of multipl e gestations.13 There is increasing evidence 
suggesting that late stages of embryo progression are better predictors of clinical pregnancy than early 
embryo development parameters .14 In good -prognosis patients, the transfer of blastocysts yields a 
higher l ive birth rate than that achieved with transfer of the same num ber of cleavage -stage embryos.  
Concerning cryopreserved cycles, both the option of programmed cycles and natural cycles is being 
provided. The methodology has been standardized within each appr oach.   
Subjects who achieve a n ongoing  pregnancy in the fresh cycle or in cryopreserved cycles initiated  
within 12  months from the start of controlled ovarian stimulation will be followed until live birth to 
collect information on pregnancy outcome. In addition, neonatal health dat a will be collected at birth, 
4 weeks and 1  year after birth.  
 
 Selection of Endpoints  
The primary endpoint of cumulative ongoing pregnancy rate covers outcome from both the initial 
stimulated fresh cycle  and the subsequent cryopreserved cycles  and thereby captures the clinical 
efficacy of a single controlled ovarian stimulation cycle in a more complete manner.  
It has been observed in previous clinical trials that most women who return to use their cryopreserved 
blast ocysts undergo 2 -3 cryopreserved cycles, and in this context 6  months would be a sufficient 
follow -up period if exclusively natural cycles were applied. In the present trial, the extent of

Ferring Pharmaceuticals  CONFIDENTIAL  cryopreserved cycles is 12  months due to the option of the programm ed cycle approach; this expansion 
to 12  months allows the trial to capture the greatest  potential of the blastocysts derived from a single 
controlled ovarian stimulation cycle.  
Positive βhCG, clinical pregnancy and vital pregnancy are included as secondary  endpoints in the trial. 
Additional secondary endpoints include total dose of gonadotropins and pharmacodynamic parameters  
of FSH , such as ovarian response in terms of follicular development, endocrine profile and oocytes 
retrieved, and also oocyte / blast ocyst quality , including blastocyst survival and re -expansion in the 
cryopreserved cycles . Follicular development and endocrine profile will be evaluated after the initial 
4 days of ovarian stimulation (i.e. before any potential IMP dose adjustments and before start of the 
GnRH antagonist) as well as at the end of stimulation. The endocrine profile consists of AMH, FSH, 
LH, estradiol, progesterone, inhibin A and inhibin B.  
Clinical safety endpoints cove r adverse events, clinical chemistry and hematology parameters,  local 
tolerability,  immunogenicity , OHSS and pregnancy -related events (i.e. multi -fetal gestations, 
biochemical pregnancies, spontaneous abortions, ectopic pregnancies and vanishing twins). Pr e-
defined local tolerability reactions, i.e. redness, pain, itching, swelling and bruising, will be assessed by 
the subjects on three occasions after each subcutaneous IMP injection spanning from immediately to 
24 hours after. Presence of anti -FSH antibodi es will be evaluated 7 -10 and 21 -28 days afte r the last 
administration of FE  999049 for assessment of a potential immunoglobulin M (IgM) response and a 
fully mounted immunoglobulin G (IgG) immune response, respectively.15 Technical malfunction of the 
pens used for administration of FE 999049 and placebo will also be monitored.  
Live birth is the ultimate objective for couples starting infertility treatment. Nevertheless, it can be 
justified to use ongoing pregnancy rate as an endpoint indicative of the final  treatment outcome as few 
pregnancy losses occur after confirmation of ongoing pregnancy.16 In the ESTHER -1 trial, the absolute 
difference between live birth rate and ongoing pregnancy rate was -0.7% among the women aged ≥35 
years.  In the present trial, ongoing pregnancies in the fresh and cryopreserved cycles will be followed 
until live birth , allowing for evaluation of cumulative live birth rate. Neonatal health data at birth, 
4 weeks and 1 year after birth will be collected for infants born after the fresh cycle and cryopreserved 
cycles to provide  additional safety information.  
In conclusion, the primary and secondary endpoints are appropriate for a phase 3 trial designed to 
document the efficacy  and safety of a gonadotropin intended for controlled ovarian stimulation . 
 
 Blinding  
The randomized, placebo -controlled, double -blind trial design will ensure random allocation  of eligible

3.5.4.2  Concom itant Fertility Medication  
Controlled Ovarian Stimulation and Fresh Cycle  
The doses and overall treatment regimens for the GnRH antagonist (GANIRELIX), hCG ( NOVAREL ) 
and progesterone (ENDOMETRIN) products are in line with the recommendations in the respect ive 
products’ Prescribing Information and/or standard clinical practice within ART . The GnRH agonist 
(LEUPROLIDE ACETATE) is included as an option for triggering of final follicular maturation in 
subjects with ≥20 follicles with a diameter of ≥12 mm or serum estradiol concentration  ≥3,000 pg/mL 
as this approach is associated with a decreased risk of early severe OHSS despite high ovarian 
response.20,21,22,23,24 The use of a GnRH agonist for triggering of final follicular maturation in a GnRH 
antagonist protocol is well -described in the literature and considered an acceptable alternative to cycle 
cancellation.25,26,27 Although subjects with GnRH agonist triggering do not undergo blastocyst transfer 
in the fresh cycle, the trial design with cryopreserved cycles and a cumulative ongoing pregnancy 
endpoint means that the efficacy evaluation is not compromised.

Ferring Pharmaceuticals  CONFIDENTIAL  Cryopreser ved Cycles  
For the programmed cryopreserved cycles, the doses and treatment regimens for estradiol 
(ESTRA DIOL Tablets USP ) and progesterone (PROGESTERONE Injection USP) are in line with 
standard clinical practice within ART.   
For the natural cryopreserved cycles , the dose  of progesterone (ENDOMETRIN) is in line with the 
Prescribing Information.  
 
 Selection of the Trial Population  
This trial will include women aged 35-42 years who are eligible for IVF or ICSI and who have 
undergone no more than one previous controlled ovarian stimulation cycle. The subjects have been 
diagnosed with tubal infertility, unexplained infertility, endometriosis stage I/II or have partners 
diagnosed with male factor infertility. The allowed body mass index (BMI) is 17.5 -38.0 kg/m2, thus 
including underweight, normal weight,  overweight and obese subjects.  
The exclusion criteria incorporate the contraindications for the use of gonadotropins and other 
concomitant fertility medications used in the trial.  
 
 Follow -up Procedure s 
Post-trial Activities  
Post-trial activities cover pregnancy and neonatal health follow -up at birth, 4  weeks and 1  year after 
birth, after the fresh cycle and all cryopreserved cycles initiated within 12  months from the start of 
controlled ovarian stimula tion. 
It is foreseen that the long extent of follow -up will pose challenges. While the ongoing pregnancy visit 
will take place at the trial sites, later pregnancy monitoring and delivery does not occur at the trial site 
but at the subject’s general practit ioner, OB/GYN specialist, hospital etc. Likewise, neonatal health 
follow -up is not performed at the trial sites. Efforts will be made to capture the follow -up information 
described in the protocol by use of contact logs and other measures, but instances of  missing data 
especially as the follow -up period advances  cannot be ruled out . 
 
Immunogenicity Follow -up 
As a safety precaution, subjects with treatment -induced anti -FSH antibody response will be followed 
until the response has become negative or returned to the pre -dosing level, or for a maximum of 1  year 
after the second post -dose sampling. The follow -up procedure involves frequent visits/samples in the

Clinical Trial Protocol  
Ferring Pharmaceuticals  CONFIDENTIAL  The subject can also be withdrawn from the trial at any time at the discretion of the investigato r. For 
any discontinuation, the investigator will obtain all the required details and document the date of the 
premature terminati on and the main reason in the e CRF.  
A subject that withdraws from the trial will not be replaced.  
 
Withdrawal of Consent  
If the subject withdraws her consent, data collected up to withdrawal will remain in the database, but 
no further data will be collected. Samples and recordings obtained before withdrawal may be analyzed. 
This will be described in the Informed Consent Documen ts. The subject can request destruction of 
samples which would otherwise have been kept in storage.  
 
4.5 Trial Stopping Criteria  
Occurrence of the following adverse events or abnormal laboratory values may warrant consideration 
of trial termination:  
• Life-threa tening serious adverse events ( SAEs ) with suspected causality to the IMP, including 
but not limited to OHSS ( section 8.3.1 ) 
• Formation of treatment -induced neutralizing antibodies to  FSH 
 
The internal Safety Management Team  at the sponsor will review each occurrence and provide a 
recommendation as to whether to terminate  the trial. The responsibilities and composition of the 
internal Safety Management  Team are provided in a separate charter document, available before the 
first subject’s first visit.

 Investigational Medicinal Product s 
Subjects will be randomized in a 10:1 ratio to FE  999049:placebo. The dosing regimen for FE  999049 
and placebo is described in  Table 5-1. 
 
Table 5-1 FE 999049 and Placebo Dosing Regimen  
IMP  Dosing regimen  
FE 999049  Starting do se of 15  µg daily  fixed for the first four stimulati on days. Based on the  
ovarian response , the dose may be  adjusted by 3  µg, with dose increases implemented 
not mo re frequently than once every 2  days and dose decreases i mplemented per 
investigator’s judgement . The minimum daily dose is 6 µg, and the maximum daily 
dose is 24 µg.  
Subcutaneous injection in the lower part of the abdomen . 
Placebo  to 
FE 999049  Pen will be dialed to the same value (dose) as if administered FE 999049.  
Subcutaneous injection in the lower part of the abdomen.  
 
The investigational medicinal products ( IMPs ) will be  self-administered by the subject as a daily 
subcutaneous injection in the lower part of the abdomen using a pre -filled injection pen. The start and 
end dates as well as daily dose of IMP will be recorded by  the subject in a diary.  To minimize local 
injection site reactions, it is advisable to change the injection site regularly, i.e. between the right and 
left lower part of the abdomen.  
Administration of IMP after reaching the triggering criterion is not all owed.  
For information on warnings and precautions, please refer to the Investigator’s Brochure for 
FE 999049.3

5.5 Blinding / Unblinding  
 Blinding  
The pr e-filled injection pens with FE  999049 and placebo will be identical in appearance. Likewise, 
the FE  999049 and placebo solutions will be identical in appearance.  
The IMP will be packaged according to a computer -generated randomization list. The randomization 
list will not be available t o any person involved in the conduct and evaluation of the trial until the trial 
database is declared clean and locked. Likewise, the treatment allocation information in the e CRF will 
not be accessible to investigators, other trial staff at site, central laboratory personnel, or sponsor  staff 
during the trial.  
 
 Unblinding of Individual Subject Treatment   
An emergency decoding possibility  will be available to the investigator and designated persons at 
Ferring. It is the investig ator’s responsibility to decide whether it is medically necessary to know the 
investigational product the subject receives (i.e. unblinding) to ensure the subject’s welfare and safety. 
Breaking of the blind for individual subjects in emergency situations c ould b e required in case of 
suspected  unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSARs) or in case of other important adverse events 
when the knowledge of the IMP in question is required for therapeutic decisions for the management of 
the subject.  
As far as t he emergency permits, the need to break the blind will be agreed by the investigator and 
Ferring.  Where the event requires immediate unblinding by the investigator, Ferring must be informed 
of the unblinding as soon as possible and provided with the ration ale for unblinding. The 
investigator/person who unblinds a treatment will use the eCRF in which he/she is required to enter a 
password and record the reason for unblinding before the treatment code can be broken. The e CRF 
automatically records when and by whom the code is broken.  The investigator must record the event of 
unblinding in the subject’s medical record, including the reason for unblinding, but not the treatment 
allocation if this can be avoided.  
In case of accidental unblinding, the same procedur e as for emergency unblinding must be followed, 
i.e. the person who is accidentally unblinded  will enter a password in the e CRF and must record the 
reason for unblinding, while the eCRF records when and by whom the code is broken.  In addition the 
event mus t also be recorded in the subject’s medical record.

Clinical Trial Protocol  
Ferring Pharmaceuticals  CONFIDENTIAL  If Ferring needs to unbli nd a subject’s treatment, the e CRF will be used for unblinding. It is required to 
enter a password and the reason for unblinding before the trea tment code can be broken. The e CRF 
records when and by whom the code was broken. The code break will occur according to corporate 
standard operating procedures for unplanned unblinding of trial subjects. It may be necessary to 
unblind an individual subject’s treatment for the purposes of ex pedited reporting to the relevant health 
authorities and/or IRBs. In that situation, every effort will be made to maintain blinding of Ferring 
personnel involved in data analysis and interpretation. Other personnel may be unblinded for SUSARs, 
including tr ial site staff as well as staff acting on behalf of Ferring.  
Information on whether the blind has been broken for any subjects is available in the e CRF and must 
be collected before the database is declared clean and is released to the trial statistician.  
In case the e CRF cannot be accessed by the investigator, and hence the emergency unblinding c annot 
be performed within the e CRF system, the investigator should contact Ferring Pharmacovigilance 
using the contact details given below.

If Ferring Pharma covigilance cannot access the e CRF, a ba ck-up procedure involving the e CRF vendor 
is in place.  
 
5.6 Treatment Compliance , Dispensing and Accountability  
The IMP will only be dispensed to subjects who meet the eligibility criteria and are randomized to a 
treatment group in the trial. The investigator (or his/her designated staff, e.g. trial nurse) will maintain 
a drug -dispensing log detailing the dates and quantities of  IMPs/NIMPs dispensed to, and used by, 
each subject, as well as the batch numbers, IMP/NIMP numbers or other identifier used in the trial.  
The monitor will verify the drug accountability during the trial and if applicable document any 
discrepancies.  
In or der to monitor compliance, the subjects are to return empty, partially used, and unused vials , pens, 
syringes, tablets  or inserts to the investigator at each visit. The investigator (or his/her designated staff, 
e.g. trial nurse) will reconcile and document the return on the drug accountability log. Any 
discrepancies should be discussed with the subject at the time of the return.

• Recording of adverse events (from the date of signed informed c onsent for participation in the 
trial)  
 
Subjects considered eligible for the trial based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria assessed at this 
time point may proceed to the next visit, scheduled on day 2 -3 of the subject’s menstrual cycle.  
In case of po sitive findings  of HBsAg , HCV  or HIV antibody tests  obtained at screening , it is the 
investigator’s responsibility to ensure that standard reporting and referral procedures at the sites are 
followed in line with local regulations.  
 
 Stimulation Day 1  
Subjec ts will attend the stimulation day 1 visit on day 2 -3 of their menstrual cycle.  
The following must take place prior to randomization:  
• Ensure that the subject is still eligible for participation in the trial  
• Check those inclusion and exclusion criteria that  were not possible during screening  
• Body weight  
• Urine pregnancy test – must be negative  
• Transvaginal ultrasound of uterus (endometrial thickness , echogenicity pattern)  and ovaries 
(number and size of follicles , ovarian volume )

Once the above has been completed, the followin g must be performed : 
• Hand out the diary for recording of local tolerability to the subject.   
The subject must be instructed to assess and record local tolerability after each IMP 
administration throughout the entire stimulation period . The first evaluation  of local tolerability 
reactions at the injection site is done immediately after the injection of IMP, followed by a 
second evaluation 30 min utes after injection of IMP and a third  evaluation 24  hours after 
injection of IMP (before the next day’s injection  of IMP). In case the subject has any concern 
related to an injection site reaction, the investigator should be contacted for possible further 
assessment, prior to the next IMP injection.  
• Dispense IMP according to randomization and instruct the subject on how to administer the 
IMP. The subject will self -administer the IMP (at the trial site or at home) as a subcutaneous 
injection in the lower part of the abdomen. The starting dose for the first 4 days is fixed at 
15 µg. 
 
Finally, the following must be done before the subject leaves the site : 
• Recording of use of any concomitant medication  
• Recording of adverse events

 Ongoing Pregnancy  
A transvaginal or abdominal ultrasound of the uterus will be performed 8 -9 weeks after transfer in the 
fresh cycle and in the cryopreserved cycles. Ongoing pregnancy will be defined as at least one 
intrauterine viable fetus. For ongoing pregnancies, the number of intrauterine viable fetuses will be 
recorded.  
 
 Time t o Ongoing P regnancy  
Based on the recordings of start of controlled ovarian stimulation (date) and confirmation of ongoing 
pregnancy (date), the time to ongoing pregnancy will be calculated. Furthermore, based on the 
recording of which cycle the ongoing pre gnancy occurred in, the number of cycles before achieving an 
ongoing pregnancy will be determined.  
 
 Ongoing Implantation  
Ongoing implantation is determined based on the ultrasound performed at the ongoing pregnancy visit  
in the fresh cycle and in the cryop reserved cycles . Ongoing implantation rate will be defined as the 
number of intrauterine viable fetuses 8 -9 weeks after blastocyst transfer divided by number of 
blastocysts transferred.  
 
 Clinical Pregnancy  
A transvaginal ultrasound of the uterus will be pe rformed 5 -6 weeks after transfer in the fresh cycle 
and in the cryopreserved cycles. Clinical pregnancy will be defined as at least one gestational sac, 
either intrauterine or ectopic. The inclusion of ectopic pregnancies and the lack of specification of h eart 
beat in the definition of clinical pregnancy is in line with the current International Committee 
Monitoring Assisted Reproductive Technologies (ICMART) and World Health Organization (WHO) 
glossary on ART terminology.29,d For intrauterine and ectopic pregnancies, the number of gestational 
sacs with fetal heart beat as well as without fetal heart beat will be recorded.

 Vital Pregnancy  
Vital pregnancy is determined based on the transvaginal ultrasound performed at the clinical pregnancy 
visit in the fre sh cycle and in the cryopreserved cycles. Vital pregnancy will be defined as at least one 
intrauterine gestat ional sac with fetal heart beat 5-6 weeks after blastocyst transfer.  
 
 Implantation  
Implantation is determined based on the transvaginal ultrasound performed at the clinical pregnancy 
visit in the fresh cycle and in the cryopreserved cycles . Implantation rate will be defined as the number 
of gestational sacs 5 -6 weeks after  blastocyst  transfer divided by number of blastocysts transferred.  
 
 Positive βhCG 
A blood serum βhCG test must be obtained 10 -14 days after blastocyst transfer  in the fresh cycle and in 
the cryopreserved cycles . If the test is positive according to the local laboratory’s reference ranges, this 
confirms a positive βhCG . In case of a doubtful / inconclusive βhCG result, a second test will be 
performed, preferably within 2 days , and the conclusive result recorded . 
 
 Triggering of Final Follicular Maturation , Cycle Cancellation and Transfer 
Cancellation  
The drug used for triggering of final follicular maturation , i.e. hCG or GnRH agonist , will be recorde d. 
The reason for each cycle cancellation will be recorded.  
The reason for each transfer cancellation will be recorded. Transfer cancellation due to adverse events  
such as the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities preferred terms (MedDRA PTs) ‘ovarian 
hyperfunction ’ and ‘ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome ’ in subjects with blastocysts available for 
transfer will be considered as transfer cancellations due to risk of OHSS.  Similarly, transfer 
cancellations in subjects with ≥20 oocytes retrieved will be considered as transfer cancellations due to 
risk of OHSS .

 Number and Size of Follicles during Stimulation  
Transvaginal ultrasou nd will be performed at all visits during the controlled ovarian stimulation period 
to count the number of follicles and measure the size of the follicl es. Each follicle will be measured in 
2 dimensions , and its diameter will be calculated as the  mean of the largest diameter and its 
perpendicular value . 
The total number of follicles and number of follicles with a diameter of 8-9 mm, 10 -11 mm, 
12-14 mm, 15 -16 mm, and ≥17  mm on stimulation day 5 and at end -of-stimulation will be recorded. 
Data will be recorded separately for the right and left ovary.  
 
 Number and Distribution of Oocytes Retrieved  
The number of oocytes retrieved will be recorded at the oocyte retrieval visit. The proportion of 
subjects with <4 oocytes, 4 -7 oocytes, 8 -14 oocytes, 15 -19 oocytes and ≥20 oocytes will be calculated.  
 
 Number of Metaphase II Oocytes  
Maturity stage will be assessed prior to insemination for oocytes that will undergo ICSI. Maturity stage 
will be categorized as germinal vesicle, metaphase I, metaphase II, degene rated or other.  
 
 Number of Fertilized Oocytes and Fertilization  Rate  
The number of pronuclei will be counted at 19 h (±2h)  after insemination and recorded as 0, 1, 2 or >2. 
Fertilized oocytes with 2 pronuclei (2PN) will be regarded as correctly fertilized. Fertilization rate is 
the number of 2PN oocytes divided by the number of oocytes retrieved.  
 
 Number and Quality of Blastocysts on Day 5  
The quality evaluation of blastocysts on day 5 after oocyte retrieval will consist of assessment of three 
parameters: bl astocyst expansion and hatching status, blastocyst inner cell mass grading, and 
trophectoderm grading. The scoring is based on the classification system by Gardner & Schoolcraft,30 
with the addition of D -categories for inner cell mass and trophectoderm.  
Blastocyst expansion and hatch ing status will be assessed as one  of the following:  
 An early blastocyst, blastocoel being less than half volume of that of the embryo.  
 A blastocyst with a blastocoel whose volume is half of, or greater than half of, that of the  
embryo.

Clinical Trial Protocol  
Ferring Pharmaceuticals  CONFIDENTIAL  Endometrial thickness (composed o f both layers of the endometrium) will be measured in the sagittal 
view of the uterus from the proximal and distal interfaces between the echogenic endometrium and the 
hypoechoic inner layer of the myometrium. Care should be taken not to include the hypoec hoic 
subendometrial halo and to account for the presence of any fluid in the uterine cavity (not to be 
included in the endometrial thickness value).  
Endometrial echogenicity pattern will be recorded as hypoechogenic, isoechogenic, hyperechogenic, or 
not po ssible to evaluate.  
 
 Oocyte Utilization Rate and Oocyte Efficiency Index  
Based on the recordings of the number of oocytes retrieved and the number of blastocysts transferred 
or cryopreserved, the oocyte utilization rate will be calculated.  
Based on the rec ordings of the number of oocytes retrieved and the cumulative number of ongoing 
pregnancies, the oocyte efficiency index rate will be calculated.  
 
 Blastocyst Survival and  Re-expansion after Cryopreservation  
Blastocyst survival after cryopreservation will b e assessed for all thawed blastocysts at 0h (+0.5h) after 
thawing. Furthermore, re -expansion will be assessed for all surviv ing blastocysts at 2.5h (±0.5h) after 
thawing.  
 
 Number of Cryopreserved Cycles  
A programmed  cryopreserved cycle is considered as initiated if the subject has started  estradiol 
treatment . 
A natural cryopreserved cycle is considered as initiated if the subject has started LH surge monitoring.  
The number of cryopreserved cycles initiated within 12  months from the start of controlled ovarian 
stimulation, and the number of cryopreserved cycles with blastocyst transfer will be recorded.  
 
 Circulating Levels of Endocrine Parameters  
The following endocrine parameters will be evaluated  during controlled ov arian stimulation : AMH, 
FSH, LH, estradiol , progesterone,  inhibin A and inhibin B.  
Blood samples will be drawn on stimulation  day 1, stimulation  day 5, end-of-stimulation  and oocyte 
retrieval . The sample on stimulation day 1 (baseline) will be collected pr ior to the first dose of IMP,

laboratory.  
The endocrine parameters include pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic markers of FSH therapy, 
and therefore to maintain blinding of treat ment allocation the laboratory results from samples drawn 
after stimulation day 1 will not be made available to the investigator, other trial staff at site, or sponsor 
staff.  
 
 Total Gonadotropin Dose , Number of Stimulation Days and Number of Dose 
Adjustmen ts 
The administration dates as well as daily dose of IMP will be recorded by the subject in a diary. These 
data will be used to calculate the total dose of FE 999049 or placebo  (actual and intended dose) 
administered, the number of stimulation days, and the number of dose adjustments.  
In addition, the reason for dose adjustment will be recorded by the investigator, using the following 
categories: a) inadequate follicular development, b) inadequate serum estradiol level, c) inadequate 
follicular development and inadequate serum estradiol level, d) excessive follicular development, 
e) excessive serum estradiol level, f) excessive follicular development and excessive serum estradiol 
level.

The investigator will review the laboratory results from all visits and evaluate and document whether 
the abnormal results are non -clinically or clinically significant. The laboratory report will be signed 
and dated by the investigator.  
 
 Injection Site Reactions  
Every day throughout the stimulation period, the subjects will assess the local tolerability of 
subcutaneous injections of FE  999049 and placebo at three time points relative to the daily 
administration: immediately after the injection, 30  minutes after the injection and 24  hours after the 
injection. The following injection site reactions will be assessed: redness, pain, itching , swelling and 
bruising. The presence and intensity of each injection site reaction will be rated as one of the 
following: none, mild, moderate or severe.  
The subject will record the assessments in a paper diary and the diary data will subse quently be 
transcribed to the e CRF.  
In case a subject has any concern related to an injection site reaction, the investigator should be 
contacted for possible further assessment, prior to the next IMP injection.  
 
 Anti -FSH Antibodies  
Blood samples for assessment of anti -FSH antibodies in the individual subjects in the trial will be

Ferring has developed the following assays for evaluating th e immu nogenicity of FE  999049 : 
Assay 1  A screening immunoassay, assessing the presence of anti -FSH antibodies in serum, 
using a cut -point approach with a 5% false positive rate.  
Assay 2  A confirmatory immunoassay, confirming or disconfirming the specificity of any 
positive results in assay 1, using a cut -point approach with a 1% false positive rate.  
Assay 3  A titer immunoassay determining the antibody response titer of any anti -FSH antibodies 
confirmed in assay 2.  
Assay 4  A cell -based assay qualitatively assessi ng the neutralizing  capacity of any anti -FSH 
antibodies confirmed in assay 2, using a cut -point approach with a 1% false positive 
rate. 
Assay 5  A cell -based assay determining the neutralizing  antibody response titer of any positive 
result in assay 4.  
Assay  6 A confirmatory assay based on native FSH, in order to assess cross -reactivity with 
native FSH of any anti -FSH antibodies confirmed to be specific towards exogenous FSH 
in assay 2, using a cut -point approach with a 1% false positive rate.  
 
In subjects wi th a negative pre -dosing sample, a treatment -induced anti -FSH antibody response will be 
defined as any post -dosing sample being positive in the  confirmatory assay (assay 2 ).

Ferring Pharmaceuticals  CONFIDENTIAL  In subjects with a positive pre -dosing sample, a treatment -induced anti -FSH antibody response will be 
defined as a statistically determined fold increase in titers  from the pre -dosing assessment to a post -
dosing assessment.e 
All positive samples in the co nfirmatory assay ( assay 2) will be further characterized  for titer, 
neutralizing  capacity (qualitatively and titer, if applicable) and cross -reactivity. A subject is defined to 
have treatment -induced anti -FSH antibodies with neutralizing  capacity if she ha s a positive outcome of 
assay 4 after IMP administration and if she was negative for anti -FSH antibodies with neutralizing  
capacity at pre -dosing. Ferring will report t reatment -induced neutralizing  antibodies to the F DA. 
The proportion of subjects with tre atment -induced anti -FSH antibodies and the proportion of subjects 
with treatment -induced anti -FSH antibodies with neutralizing  capacity are secondary endpoints.  
Subjects with a treatment -induced anti -FSH antibody response (both with and without neutralizi ng 
capacity) will be followed until the response is negative or has returned to pre -dosing level or after a 
maximum of 1 year. These subjects will be called in for assessments 2 months after the last post -dosing 
anti-FSH antibody sampling. If required, fur ther assessments will be made at 3, 4, 6, 9 and 12  months 
after the last post -dosing anti -FSH antibody sampling. The assessments will be terminated when two 
consecutive assessments are negative or indicate that the pre -dosing level has been reached, or aft er a 
maximum of 1 year. The assessments will also be terminated if the subject commences a new treatment 
cycle with a ny gonadotropin preparation.  
 
 Immune -related Adverse Events  
All treatment -emergent adverse events will be analyzed to identify those that potentially are immune -
related. To identify all possible cases, a broad -scope search on Standardized  MedDRA  Queries 
(SMQs), including ‘Hypersensitivity’, ‘Anaphylactic reactions’, ‘Angioedema’ and ‘Sev ere cutaneous 
adverse reactions’ will be considered. Moreover, to identify the potential cases manifested by non -
specific symptoms and not covered by these SMQs, other MedDRA PTs like ‘Musculoskeletal pain’, 
‘Asthenia’, ‘Pyrexia’, ‘Chills’, ‘Body temperatu re increased’, ‘Influenza like illness’, ‘Injection related 
reaction’, ‘Presyncope’ and ‘Syncope’ will also be taken into account. Hypersensitivity reactions 
manifested by local symptoms will be identified using the MedDRA high level term (HLT) ‘injection 
site reactions’. The SMQs may include very specific as well as less specific terms; hence a narrow -
scope search on these SMQs will be carried out to identify those cases that are highly likely to 
represent an immune -related etiology.  
 
 
e  The fold increase in titers is determined by minimum sig nificant ratio (MSR) experiments during assay validation  and 
will be stated in the validation report and the clinical trial report.

Ferring Pharmaceuticals  CONFIDENTIAL  8 ADVERSE EVENTS  
8.1 Adverse Event Definition  
An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject participating in a clinical trial. It 
includes:  
• Any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom or disease temporally associated with the use 
of the IMP, whether or not considered to be caused by the IMP.  
• Adverse events commonly observed and adverse events anticipated based on the 
pharmacological effect of the IMP.  
• Any laboratory abnormality, vital sign or finding from physical or gynecological  examination 
assessed as clinically significant by the investigator  [note: pre-existing conditions diagnosed 
through assessments and examinations at the screening visit or during the screenin g period are 
not adverse events, but are recorded as medical history].  
• Accidental injuries, reasons for any change in medication (drug and/or dose), reasons for any 
medical, nursing or pharmacy consultation, or reasons for admission to hospital or surgical  
procedures.  
 
All adverse events will be coded by Ferring Global Pharmacovigilance using MedDRA  (the version 
effective at trial start).  
 
8.2 Collection and Recording of Adverse Events  
 Collection of Adverse Events  
The investigator must monitor the condition of the subject throughout the trial from  the time of signed 
informed consent for participation in the trial until the end -of-cycle visit in the fresh cycle. In any 
cryopreserved cycle, adverse events will be recorded from cycle initiation until the end -of-cycle visit.  
The sources of adverse events cover:  
• The subject’s response to questions about her health (a standard non -leading question such as

 Recording of Adverse Events  
The investigator must record all adverse events in the Adverse Event Log  provided in each subject’s 
eCRF with information about:  
• Adverse event  
• Date and time of onset  
• Intensity  
• Causal relationship to IMP  
• Action taken to IMP  
• Other action taken  
• Date and time of outcome  
• Outcome  
• Seriousness  
 
Each of the items in the Adverse Event Log is described in detail in the following sections.  
 
Adverse Event  
Adverse events should be recorded as diagnoses, if available. If not, separate signs and symptoms 
should be recorded. One diagnosis/symptom should be entered per record.  
If a subject suffers from the same adverse event more than once and the subject recovers in between 
the events, the adverse events should be recorded separa tely. If an adverse event changes in intensity, a 
worst -case approach should be used when recording the event, i.e. the highest intensity and the longest 
duration of the event.f 
Note : a procedure is not an adverse event; the reason for conducting the proc edure is. Hospitalization is 
not an adverse event; the reason for hospitalization is. Death is not an adverse event, but the cause of 
death is (an exception is sudden death of unknown cause, which is an adverse event).  
 
 
f  Exception: if an adverse event with onset before the first IMP administration (i.e. a pre -treatment adverse event) 
worsen s in intensity, this must be recorded as two separate events. The initial adverse event should be recorded with 
outcome “not recovered” and the date and time of outcome is when the intensity changed. The second adverse event 
should be recorded with date an d time of onset when the intensity changed.

Ferring Pharmaceuticals  CONFIDENTIAL  Date and Time of Onset  
The date of o nset is the date when the first sign(s) or symptom(s) were first noted. If the adverse event 
is an abnormal clinically significant laboratory test or outcome of an examination, the onset date is the 
date the sample was taken or the examination was performe d. 
 
Intensity  
The intensity of an adverse event must be classified using the following 3 -point scale:  
Mild:  Awareness of signs or symptoms, but no disruption of usual activity.  
Moderate:  Event sufficient to affect usual activity (disturbing).  
Severe:  Inabi lity to work or perform usual activities (unacceptable).  
 
Causal Relationship to IMP  
The possibility of whether the IMP caused the adverse event must be classified as one of the following:  
Reasonable possibility :  
There is evidence or argument to suggest a  causal relationship between the IMP and the adverse event. 
The adverse event may occur as part of the pharmacological action of the IMP or may be unpredictable 
in its occurrence.  
Examples:  
• Adverse events that are uncommon but are known to be strongly associated with IMP exposure.  
• Adverse events that are not commonly associated with IMP exposure, but the event occurs in 
association with other factors strongly suggesting causation, such as a strong temporal 
association or the event recurs on rec hallenge with the IMP.  
 
No reasonable possibility : 
There is no reasonable evidence or argument to suggest a causal relationship between the IMP and the 
adverse event.  
Examples:  
• Known consequences of the underlying disease or condition under investigation.

Ferring Pharmaceuticals  CONFIDENTIAL  • Adverse events common in the trial population, which are also anticipated to occur with some 
frequency during the course of the trial, regardless of IMP exposure.  
 
Action Taken to IMP  
The action taken to the IMP in response to an adverse event must be clas sified as one of the following:  
• No change (medication schedule maintained or no action taken)  
• Discontinued  
• Interrupted  
• Dose reduced  
• Dose increased  
 
Other Action Taken  
Adverse events requiring therapy must be treated with recognized standards of medical car e to protect 
the health and well -being of the subject. Appropriate resuscitation equipment and medicines must be 
available to ensure the best possible treatment of an emergency situation.  
If medication is administered to treat the adverse event, this medic ation should be entered in the 
Concomitant Medication Log . 
 
Date and Time of Outcome  
The date and time the subject recovered or died.  
 
Outcome  
The outcome of an adverse event must be classified as one of the following:  
• Recovered (fully recovered or the condition has returned to the level observed at initiation of 
trial treatment)  
• Recovered with sequelae (resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity)  
• Recovering (the event is improving)  
• Not recovered  
• Fatal

Ferring Pharmaceuticals  CONFIDENTIAL  8.3 Adverse Events of Special Interest  
 Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome  
Symptoms and Classification  
OHSS is an adverse event of special interest during controlled ovarian stimulation. Investigators will 
record OHSS symptoms using a classification system based on Golan’s classification system31 as 
shown in Table 8-1 to grade (1, 2, 3. 4 or 5) each OHSS case.  
 
Table 8-1 Classification of Mild, Moderate and Severe OHSS (Based on Golan’s Classification 
System)  
Mild OHSS  
 Grade 1  Abdominal distension and discomfort  
 Grade 2  Features of grade 1 plus nausea/vomiting and/or diarrhea. Ovaries enlarged to 
5-12 cm.a) 
Moderate OHSS  
 Grade 3  Features of mild OHSS plus ultrasonic evidence of ascites.b)  
Severe OHSS  
 Grade 4  Features of moderate OHSS plus clinical evidence of ascites and/or hydrothorax (or 
breathing difficulties). Paracentesis due to OHSS symptoms.c) 
 Grade 5  All of the above plus change in blood volume, increased blood viscosity due to 
hemoconcentration, coagulation abnormalities, and diminished renal perfusion and 
function.d) Hospitalization due to OHSS symptoms.e) 
a)  For each ovary, the size will be the average of the greatest diameter and its greatest perpendicular diameter. Ovarian 
enlargement will be based on the average size of the right and left ovaries. The sizes of both ovaries should be 
recorded.  
b)  For subje cts with transvaginal evidence of ascites, the size of the fluid pockets in the pelvis (Douglas pouch, vesico -
uterine pouch, etc.) should be estimated by measuring the greatest diameter and its greatest perpendicular diameter, 
and multiplying these two num bers (the unit will be cm2). Peritoneal fluid is the total size of all fluid pockets in the 
pelvis.  
c)  In case of paracentesis, the volume of fluid drained should be measured.  
d)  Hemoconcentration is defined as hematocrit >45 %. Electrolyte disturbances  is defined as hyponatremia (sodium 
<135  mEq/L) and/or hyperkalemia (potassium >5.0 mEq/L). Coagulation abnormalities are defined as presence of 
thromboembolic events, abnormal prothrombin time or abnormal activated partial thrombin time. Diminished renal 
perfusion is defined as creatinine >1.2 mg/dl. Oliguria is defined as urine output less than 500  mL / 24 hours. Anuria 
is defined as failure to produce urine. If applicable, actual volume of urine output will be recorded.  
e)    Hospitalization is defined a s admission exceeding 24 hours.

Clinical Trial Protocol  
Ferring Pharmaceuticals  CONFIDENTIAL  All cases of OHSS must be reported as adverse events and followed until the adverse event has an 
outcome of recovered. Any case of OHSS that requires hospitalization (admission exceeding 24 hours) 
or surgical/medical inter vention (e.g. paracentesis) should be considered severe. All cases of severe 
OHSS should be reported as a n SAE.  
Please note, that the classification of ‘mild OHSS’, ‘moderate OHSS’ and ‘severe OHSS’ does not 
refer to the classification of an adverse event ’s intensity (also rated mild, moderate, or severe), but to 
the grades in Golan’s Classification System described above.  
Subject narratives will be prepared for all OHSS cases.  
Concerning timing, early OHSS will be defined as OHSS with onset ≤9 days afte r triggering of final 
follicular maturation and late OHSS will be defined as OHSS with onset >9 days after triggering of 
final follicular maturation.  
 
Investigations in Case of OHSS  
The investigator should report signs, symptoms and laboratory assessments used to diagnose and 
classify all cases of OHSS in the e CRF. The following investigations must be conducted when OHSS 
symptoms are first observed and repeated when there are clinically relevant changes in the OHSS 
presentation  suggestive of a worsening, i. e. higher grading :  
• Body weight  
• Ultrasound of ovarian size and if applicable, measurement of pelvic/abdominal/thoracic fluid  
• Vital signs  
• Blood sample for central lab oratory  analysis of the following:  
- Progesterone and estradiol  
- CBC (red blood cells, red blood cell morphology, white blood cells,  white blood cell 
morphology, hemoglobin, h ematocrit, mean corpuscular volume, mean corpuscular 
hemoglobin , mean corpuscular hemoglobin  concentration, platelets)  
- CHEM -20 (alanine transaminase, albumin, alkaline phosphatase, aspartate 
aminotransferase, bicarbonate, bilirubin direct, bilirubin total, blood urea nitrogen, calcium, 
chloride, cholesterol total, creatinine, gamma -glutamyl transpeptidase, glucose, lactate 
dehydrogenase, phosphorus, potassium, s odium, total protein, uric acid)  
- Coagulation parameters (prothrombin time, activated partial thrombin time)  
 
Any treatments of OHSS, e.g. intravenous administration of volume expanders, paracentesis, use of 
low-molecular -weight heparin and intravenous admi nistration of albumin, must be recorded as

 Pregnancy Losses  
The following terminology should be used for reporting of pregnancy losses as adverse events:  
Biochemical pregnancy:  Positive βhCG test but no gestational sac is observed  on later 
transvaginal ultrasound, or menstruation is reported  
 Spontaneous abortion:  Positive βhCG test but all intrauterine gestational sacs are without 
fetal heart beat as documented by ultrasound, or there are no 
viable fetuses observed by ultrasound  
 Vanishing twin:  Spontaneous disappearance of at least one intrauterine gestational 
sac with or without heart beat in a pregnancy where one viable 
fetus remains as documented by ultrasound  
 Ectopic pregnancy:  Extrauterine gestational sac with or without fe tal heart beat as 
documented by ultrasound or surgery  
 
Concerning timing, a pregnancy loss occurring before ongoing pregnancy (i.e. a positive βhCG test but 
no ongoing pregnancy at 8 -9 weeks after transfer) will be defined as an early pregnancy loss, while  a 
pregnancy loss occurring after ongoing pregnancy (i.e. at least one intrauterine viable fetus at 
8-9 weeks after transfer but no live birth) during the post -trial follow -up will be defined as a late 
pregnancy loss.  
 
8.4 Events Requiring Special Handling  
 Injection Site Reactions  
Injection site reactions after administration of IMP (FE 999049 or placebo) are only to be reported as 
adverse events if they require active management, i.e. discontinuation of IMP, additional investigations 
or treatment of the inject ion site reaction. Local tolerability of IMP constitutes a secondary endpoint 
and will be evaluated in detail based on the subjects’ recordings in the diary.  
Local tolerability reactions after administration of NIMP are to be reported as adverse events if  they 
fulfil the definition of an adverse event.

 Serious Adverse Event Definition  
Serious Adverse Events during the Trial  
An event is defined a serious  
adverse event (SAE) if it:  Guidance  
results in death  Any event resulting in a fatal outcome must be fully documented and reported, 
including deaths occurring within four weeks after the treatment ends and 
irrespective of the causal relationship to the IMP. The death of a subject 
enrolled in a trial is per se  not an event, but an outcome.  
is life-threatening  The term life -threatening refers to an adverse event in which the subject was at 
immediate risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event, 
which may have caused death if it were mor e severe.  
requires in -patient  
hospitalization or prolongation 
of existing hospitalization  The term hospitalization means that the subject was admitted to hospital or that 
existing hospitalization was extended as a result of an event. Hospitalization 
descr ibes a period of at least 24 hours. Over -night stay for observation, stay at 
emergency room or treatment on an out -patient basis do not constitute a 
hospitalization. However, medical judgement must always be exercised and 
when in doubt the case should be c onsidered serious (i.e. if case fulfils the 
criterion for a medically important event). Hospitalizations for administrative 
or social purposes do not constitute an SAE. Hospital admissions and/or 
surgical operations planned before trial inclusion are not c onsidered adverse 
events, if the illness or disease existed before the subject was enrolled in the 
trial, provided that the condition did not deteriorate during the trial.  
results in persistent or 
significant 
disability/incapacity  Disability/incapacity means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to 
conduct normal life functions. In doubt, the decision should be left to medical 
judgement by the investigator.  
is an important medical event  Medical and scientific judgment shou ld be exercised in deciding whether other 
situations should be considered serious such as important medical events that 
might not be immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospitalization 
but might jeopardize the patient or might require interv ention to prevent one of 
the other outcomes listed in the definition above. Examples of such events are 
intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic 
bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in 
hospitalization, or  development of drug dependency or drug abuse.

In connection with elective termination due to a congenital anomaly, the congenital anomaly of the 
fetus should be reported as a n SAE.  
The congenital anomaly leading to elective termination will be coded using both MedDRA and ICD -10

Serious Adverse Events during Post -trial Activities  
Pregnancy outcome will be gathered for all subjects with an ongoing pregnancy in the fresh or any 
cryopreserve d cycles initiated within 12 months from the  start of controlled ovarian stimulation. 
Furthermore, data will be collected on neonatal health, including minor/major congenital  anomalies , at 
birth, 4 weeks and 1 year after birth. These data will be reported se parately.  
The following untoward medical occurrences reported as part of this post -trial follow -up information 
will be recorded as SAEs:  
• Death of mother in connection with pregnancy or labor  
• Death of neonate / infant  
• Stillbirthh 
• Neonate admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU)  regardless of duration, or neonate / 
infant admitted to the neonatal care unit (NCU) / pediatric care unit (PCU) for more than 
2 hours  
• Congenital anomaly / birth defect  
• Medically important event  
 
In case of admission to NICU or NCU / PCU, the reason for admission must be reported as an SAE, 
rather than just the act of hospitalization.  
Congenital anomalies will be coded by Ferring using both MedDRA and ICD -10 and classified as 
minor or major.32 
 
 
g  Minor anomalies: relatively frequent structural anomaly not likely to cause any medical or cosmetic problems.  
Major abnormalities: a life threatening structural anomaly or one likely to cause significant im pairment of health or 
functional capacity and which needs medical or surgical treatment.

 Follow -up of Adverse Events with Onset during the Trial  
During the trial, the investigator must follow -up on each adverse event until it is resolved or until the 
medical co ndition of the subject is stable.  
After the subject’s last visit, the investigator must follow -up on any adverse event classified as serious 
or considered to have a reasonable possible causality to the IMP until it is resolved or until the medical 
conditio n of the subject is stable. All such relevant follow -up information must be reported to Ferring. 
Follow -up should continue until the outcome of recovered, recovered with sequelae or fatal, has been 
reached. Further, if the event is a chronic condition, the  investigator and Ferring may agree that further 
follow -up is not required.  
 
 Follow -up of Serious Adverse Events with Onset during the Post -Trial  Period  
For post -trial SAEs in neonates, where the neonate has not recovered at the 1 -year follow -up 
assessment , the investigator must follow up until the SAE has resolved. If the SAE is a chronic 
condition or the medical condition of the neonate is stable, the investigator and Ferring may agree that 
further follow -up is not required.  
 
 Collection of Serious Adverse  Events with Onset after End -of-trial 
If an investigator becomes aware of an SAE after the subject’s last visit in the trial, and he/she assesses 
the SAE to have a reasonable possible causality to the IMP or to the NIMP where Ferring is the NDA 
holder (i.e ., ENDOMETRIN  and NOVAREL ), the case will have to be reported to Ferring 
Pharmacovigilance, regardless how long after the end of the trial this takes place.

This section details the planned statistical analyses for the primary endpoint and outlines the analysis 
plan for the secondary endpoints. All analyses and further descriptions of the statistical methodology 
for the primary and secondary endpoints will be included in the statistical analysis plan (SAP). The 
SAP will be available before the first subject is randomized in the trial. A separate SAP will be 
prepared to cover the post -trial information.  
 
9.1 Determination of Sample Size  
The proposed sample size of 550 (FE 999049:placebo = 500:50) can adequately address both the 
efficacy and safety objectives of the trial:  
• The cumulative ongoing pregnancy rate in the FE  999049 -treated subjects aged 35 -42 years is 
estimated to be approximately 30% according to results from clinical trials conducted in the 
U.S.33 By comparison, the p regnancy rate in the placebo arm is expected not to exceed 3%, the 
monthly spontaneous pregnancy rate in infertile women.34 Therefore, the proposed sample size 
of 550 (FE 999049: placebo=500:50) will provide at least 99% power for the primary efficacy 
compa rison.  Based on the estimated cumulative ongoing pregnancy rate, the cumulative live 
birth rate from the fresh and/or cryopreserved cycles is estimated to be approximately 27%, 
resulting in a power for the comparison of the cumulative live birth rate to be  at least 99%.  
• A key pharmacodynamic parameter in subjects aged 35 -42 years is cycle cancellation due to 
poor follicular development, which may occur in approximately 5% of the population exposed 
to gonadotropins.  
• The safety and tolerability of daily rFSH  preparations as part of an ART treatment cycle have 
been well documented for the population studied in previous clinical trials.1,35 OHSS was 
reported to occur in 1.7% to 3.7% of the subjects, with moderate/severe OHSS occurring in 
1.4% to 2.2% of the subjects. Other adverse events were pelvic pain, pelvic discomfort and 
headache, with those assessed to be related to trial treatments re ported in 1.5% to 7.1% of the 
subjects.  
Table 9-1 shows that the planned sample size of 500 subjects  exposed to FE  999049 provides a 
high probability to detect a rare adverse event or safety signal occurring in 0.5% or more 
subjects.

Subject disposition with respect to analysis sets will be tabulated. A separate table will summarize  the 
subject disposition with respect to analysis sets by trial site. Subject attendance at selected trial visits 
and adherence to selected trial procedures will be tabulated. The number of completed and 
discontinued subjects including reason for discontinuation will also be tabulated.  
Subject disposition with respect to analysis sets will be listed for all randomized  subjects including 
information on trial completion and reason for discontinuation for non -completers. Subjects who 
discontinued from the trial will also be listed separately.

The rating of protocol deviations as ‘minor’ and ‘major’, as well as the criteria for major protocol 
deviations with the implication of exclusions from the per -protocol (PP) analysis set will be decided by 
the medical officer, medical monitor and statistic ian on the basis of a blinded review of data before 
declaration of clean file and lock of database.  
The list of major protocol deviations will be detailed and documented in the clean file document prior 
to database release. Major protocol deviations will be summarized and listed by subject.

Non-compliance to IMP is expected to be limited and will be presented in listings. Similarly, listings 
will be prepared for subjects with deviations in the NIMP schedules for the fresh and cryopreserved 
cycles.  
 
9.7 Efficacy Endpoints Assessments  
 General Considerations  
Primary Endpoint and Secondary Efficacy Endpoints  
Upon achieving statistical significance about the primary endpoint at the 0.05 alpha level, the 
cumulative live birth rate will be formally tested at the 0.05 al pha level for inferential conclusions.  
The secondary endpoints related to pregnancy and implantation parameters are considered supportive 
of the primary endpoint  (cumulative ongoing pregnancy rate) . The secondary efficacy endpoints related 
to ovarian respo nse and embryo development parameters are intended to provide additional 
characterization  of FE  999049.  
 
Analysis and Presentation of Primary and Secondary Efficacy Endpoints  
Summary tables and treatment comparisons for the primary endpoint will be presen ted for both the 
mITT and PP analysis sets. In case that the mITT and ITT analysis sets are not identical (i.e. at least 
one subject is randomized  but not exposed) the summary tables and treatment comparisons will also be 
presented for the ITT analysis set . As applicable for the secondary endpoints, summary tables and 
treatment comparisons may be presented for the mITT and PP analysis sets.  
All tabulations will be present ed by treatment group. Continuous variables will be presented with 
number of subjects,  mean, standard deviation, median, inter -quartile range, minimum, and maximum. 
Categorical variables will be presented with number and percentage of subjects within each specific 
category.

Clinical Trial Protocol  
Ferring Pharmaceuticals  CONFIDENTIAL  All statistical tests will be performed using a two -sided test at a 5% significance level. Treatment 
differences will (where appropriate) be presented with 95% confidence intervals and p -values 
corresponding to the statistical test of the hypothesis of ‘equal effect’ against the alternative of 
‘different effect’.  
Visual displays will be produced as appropriate. All primary and secondary efficacy endpoints will be 
listed. Listings will only be produced for the mITT.  
 
Multiplicity  
In order to handle the formal testing procedures for the primary endpoint of cumulative ongoin g 
pregnancy rate and the key post -trial endpoint of cumulative live birth rate, the overall type -I error will 
be controlled by the use of a hierarchical inferential approach. Statistical significance of the primary 
endpoint at the 0.05 alpha level is requi red before drawing inferential conclusions about the key post-
trial endpoint of the cumulative live birth rate. This fixed hierarchical approach will ensure a strong 
control of the overall type -I error rate at the 0.05 level.  
All additional analyses of the  primary endpoint and secondary efficacy endpoints are considered as 
supportive. Adjustments for multiplicity will therefore not be applied.  
 
Missing Data  
Missing observations for the primary endpoint of cumulative ongoing pregnancy rate will be imputed 
as ‘negative’ irrespective of the reason why data are not recorded. Similarly, for other pregnancy 
endpoints (βhCG, clinical pregnancy and vital pregnancy) missing data will be imputed as ‘negative’ 
with the exception of a later observation in that cycle co nfirming that an earlier missing observation 
was in fact ’positive’, e.g. in case of a missing βhCG test result and a confirmed clinical pregnancy in 
the same cycle then the βhCG test result will be imputed as ‘positive’.  
For subjects with transfer but mi ssing observations on the number of viable fetuses 8 -9 weeks after 
transfer the number of viable fetuses will be imputed as zero irrespective of why data is not recorded. 
For subjects with transfer but missing information on the number of gestational sacs 5-6 weeks after 
transfer, the number of gestational sacs will be imputed as the number of viable fetuses 8 -9 weeks after 
transfer.  
For subjects with cycle cancellation, the numbers of oocytes retrieved, metaphase II oocytes, fertilized 
oocytes, and blasto cysts on day 5 will be imputed as zero.

Ferring Pharmaceuticals  CONFIDENTIAL  Missing values will not be imputed for any of the other secondary endpoints, unless otherwise noted.  
 
 Primary Endpoint  
The hypothesis to be tested for the primary endpoint, cumulative ongoing pregnancy rate, is:  
H0: πFE 999049  – πPlacebo  ≤ 0 against the alternative H A: πFE 999049  – πPlacebo  > 0, 
where π FE 999049  and π Placebo  denote the cumulative ongoing pregnancy rate after the fresh cycle and 
cryopreserved cycles in subjects aged 35-42 years treated  with FE  999049 or placebo, respectively.  
H0 will be tested against the alternative H A by constructing a two -sided 95% confidence interval for the 
difference in the cumulative ongoing pregnancy rates between the two treatment groups using the 
traditional Wald interval. If the lower limit of the two -sided 95% confidence interval  is greater t han 0, 
the null hypothesis H 0 will be rejected. In the case that the number of pregnancies observed in the 
placebo group is small (<5), then the one -sided Fisher’s exact test will be used.  
The primary endpoint will be determined as soon as the subject has achieved an ongoing pregnancy, or 
when all cryopreserved blastocysts have been exhausted, or after assessment of ongoing pregnancy 
status in cryopreserved cycles initiated within 12 months from  the start of controlled ovarian 
stimulation.  
The efficacy anal ysis will be based on the mITT  analysis set, defined as all subjects who were  
randomized and received at least one dose of IMP (FE  999049 or placebo).  
 
Sensitivity Analyses  
The primary analysis will be repeated for the subjects in the PP analysis set as se nsitivity analysis, as 
well as in the ITT analysis set if the ITT analysis set differs from the mITT analysis set. The outcomes 
of these analyses are considered supportive.  
The primary analyses described above will be repeated restricted to subjects with o ocytes retrieved and 
to subjects undergoing blastocyst transfer.  
Missing data for the primary endpoint is expected to be limited due to the trial design, but may occur if 
the subject is lost to follow -up before ongoing pregnancy is assessed. If one or more  such subjects have 
a positive pregnancy test result (βhCG test, clinical pregnancy or vital pregnancy) prior to lost to 
follow -up, the impact of imputing the ongoing pregnancy will be investigated in a sensitivity analysis.

procedures and applicable regulatory requirements, maintenance of trial -related source records, 
completeness, accuracy and verifiability of eCRF entries compared to source data, verification of drug 
accountabil ity and compliance to safety reporting instructions.  
The investigator will permit the monitor direct access to all source data, including electronic medical 
records, and/or documents in order to facilitate data verification. The investigator will co -opera te with 
the monitor to ensure that any discrepancies that may be identified are resolved. The investigator is 
expected to be able to meet the monitor during these visits.  
When the first subject is randomized at the trial site, a monitoring visit will take place shortly 
afterwards. For this trial, the frequency of the monitoring visits per site will be determined by the 
enrolment rate , observed data quality, overall site performance  and will be detailed in the Monitoring 
Plan.  
The source data verification pr ocess and definition of key variables to be monitored will be described 
in detail in the Monitoring Plan for the trial.  
 
11.2 Audit and Inspection  
The investigator will make all the trial -related source data and records available at any time to quality 
assuranc e auditor(s) mandated by Ferring, or to domestic/foreign regulatory inspectors or 
representatives from IRBs who may audit/inspect the trial.  
The main purposes of an audit or inspection are to assess compliance with the trial protocol and the 
principles of ICH-GCP including the Declaration of Helsinki and all other relevant regulations.  
The subjects must be informed by the investigator and in the Informed Consent Documents that 
authorized Ferring representatives and representatives from regulatory authoritie s and IRBs may wish 
to inspect their medical records. During audits/inspections the auditors/inspectors may copy relevant 
parts of the medical records. No personal identification apart from the screening/randomization number 
will appear on these copies.  
The investigator should notify Ferring without any delay of any inspection by a regulatory authority or 
IRB.

Clinical Trial Protocol Amendment  – Summary of Changes #01  
 
Ferring Pharmaceuticals  CONFIDENTIAL   
This Protocol Amendment   
- implicatio ns for continued trial conduct -  
is issued as urgent safety measures due to COVID -19 required to protect subjects against 
immediate hazard to their health and safety and is implemented immediately   
 
 
DOCUMENT INFORMATION : 
Protocol change intended to eliminate an apparent immediate hazard to subjects.  
 
REASON FOR CHANGE TO THE CLINICAL TRIAL PROTOCOL:  
• The COVID -19 pandemic has caused extensive restrictions on the movement of local 
populations in countries worldwide and recommendations to focus health c are resources on 
essential activities only. Subsequently, clinical trial participants are experiencing increased 
difficulty in attending scheduled visits and trial sites are operating at reduced capacity.  
 
• On 17 March 2020, t he American Society for Reprodu ctive Medicine (ASRM) issued a 
guidance on patient management and clinical recommendations, including: “Suspend 
initiation of new treatment cycles…. Strongly consider cancellation of all embryo transfers 
whether fresh or frozen… Continue to care for patien ts who are currently “in -cycle” ”.  
 
• On 18 March 2020,  the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a guidance on conduct 
of clinical trials of medicinal products during the COVID -19 pandemic, including general 
considerations for how to ensure the safety o f trial participants, maintain compliance with 
GCP and minimize risks to trial integrity.  
Ferring has conducted a risk assessment, which led to this change to the clinical trial protocol. This 
document outlines the deliberations and decisions.

Clinical Trial Protocol Amendment  – Summary of Changes #01  
 
Ferring Pharmaceuticals  CONFIDENTIAL  SUMMARY OF MAIN CHANGES TO CLINICAL TRIAL PROTOCOL : 
Recruitment to the trial has been completed and all fresh cycles have been completed up to the 
ongoing pregnancy visit. The current activities are cryo preserved cycles initiated within 12 months 
from the start of controlled ovarian stimulation as well as pregnancy follow -up to birth, 4 weeks 
and 1 year after birth  in the fresh and cryopreserved cycles . 
Ferring is issuing guidance for continued trial conduct and management of subjects included in the 
trial. The table below provides guidance for how to manage the subjects according to stage in the 
trial.  
Continued trial conduct for management of subjects  included in the trial  
• Cryo preserved cycles :  
o Cycles not yet initiated :  
do not initiate until th is COVID -19 related temporary deferral of cryo preserved  cycles 
has been lifted  
o Cycles already initiated and where transfer has not occurred:  
continue per protocol and document any deviations  
o Cycles where transfer has occurred:  
continue per protocol and docu ment any deviations  
o Note:  timelines for cryo preserved  cycles will be extended by the approximate duration 
of the temporary deferral of cryo preserved  cycles required by this change to the 
protocol  
• Pregnancy follow -up:  
continue per protocol and document any  deviations   
 
In case subjects are prevented from attending scheduled visits, the investigator (or designee) will 
attempt to contact the subject by phone or other ways to inquire about potential adverse events and 
changes to concomitant medication.

Ferring Pharmaceuticals  CONFIDENTIAL  IMPLICATIONS OF CHANGE:  
The implications of the se changes to the protocol are summari zed below. The actions are 
considered urgent safety measures due to COVID -19 required  to protect subjects against immediate 
hazard to their health and safety and are there fore implemented immediately .  
 
• Trial sites, regulatory authorities and independent research boards will be informed.  
• Subjects will be verbally informed by the investigator of potential changes to the course of 
action, as applicable for the individual subject. This will be documented in the subject’s 
medical records.  
• Protocol deviations (including deviations to the aspects described in this ‘change to 
protocol’) should be avoided whenever possible except where necessary to eliminate an 
immedi ate hazard to the subject. If deviations occur they will be documented as per 
standard practice, with additional specification whether they were related to the COVID -19 
situation.  
• Ferring will continuously monitor the situation and will resume the trial a ctivities as per 
protocol when it is judged that the situation allows for this. Ferring will notify sites, 
regulatory authorities and independent research boards accordingly.

Name of Sponsor/Company:  Dow Pharmaceutical Sciences , a division of Valeant Pharmaceuticals North 
America, LLC  
Name of Investigational Product:  IDP-120 Gel  
Name of Active Ingredient s: tretinoin and benzoyl peroxide [BPO] gel, 0.05%/2.5%  
Title of Study:  A Phas e 3, Multi -Center, Randomized, Double -Blind, Vehicle -Controlled, 2 Arm, Parallel 
Group Study Comparing  the Safety and Efficacy of IDP -120 Gel and IDP-120 Vehicle Gel in the 
Treatment of Acne Vulgaris  
Number of clinical centers:  Multicenter, approximately 24-35 investigational centers  in North America  
and Latin America  
Objective :  
The primary objective of this study is to compare the  safety, efficacy  and tolerability of IDP -120 Gel and 
IDP-120 Vehicle Gel in the treatment of subjects with moderate to severe acne vulgaris . 
Methodology:  
This is a multi -center, randomized, double -blind, vehicle -controlled, 12 -week study designed to assess the 
safety, tolerability, and efficacy of IDP -120 Gel and IDP-120 Vehicle Gel at Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12. To be 
eligib le for the study subjects must be at least 9 years of age and have a clinical diagnosis of moderate to 
severe acne (defined as an EGSS score of 3 or 4), presenting with 20-50 inflammatory facial lesions 
(papules, pustules, and nodules), 25-100 non-inflammatory facial lesions (open and closed comedones), 
and < 2 facial nodules.  
Approximately 600 subjects  will be randomized  to the following treatment groups:  
• 300 Subjects to IDP -120 Gel, once -daily application  
• 300 Subjects to IDP-120 Vehicle Gel, once -daily application  
All subjects will receive once daily, topically -applied treatment to the face for 12 weeks. Subject visits 
include Screening, Baseline, Week 2, Week 4, Week 8, and Week 12, at which safety and efficacy 
assessments will be conducted.  Study drug will be dispensed to the Subjects at Baseline, Week 4 and 
Week 8. Subjects will be evaluated for drug usage compliance at each post -baseline study visit (Weeks 2, 
4, 8, and 12). Subjects will apply their treatments at home, once daily  in the evening , as instructed by the 
study coordinator or designee  at each investigational center (with the exception of study visit days, where 
study drug will be applied by the subject on -site during the study visit).   
The investigator will assess the s ubject’s face at each study visit. Information on reported and observed 
AEs will be obtained at each visit. An abbreviated physical exam and vital signs measurement will be 
performed at Baseline and Week 12  (Final Visit)  visits for all subjects. Blood samp les will be collected 
from subjects at Baseline and  Week 12, for CBC/Diff, serum chemistry, and serum pregnancy (for pre-
menses females and females of childbearing potential ). For all pre-menses females and females of 
childbearing potential (FOCBP), urine pregnancy testing will be performed at Screening, Baseline prior to 
randomization, and at Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12. All subjects will also be asked to complete the Acne -Specific 
Quality of Life Questionnaire at Baseline and Week 12 . In addition, at selected s ites, standardized 
photography of the fac e will be performed at Baseline  and Weeks 2, 4, 8 and 12.  
Number of subjects planned:  
Approximately 600 subjects  with moderate to severe acne vulgaris will be enrolled and randomized in the 
study. Subject will be  randomized  to the following treatment groups : 
• 300 Subjects to IDP -120 Gel, once -daily application  
• 300 Subjects to IDP-120 Vehicle Gel, once -daily application

 Efficacy Measurements:  
Lesion Counts  
At each visit the Evaluator will count the total number of inflammatory lesions (papules, pustules, and 
nodules) on the subject’s face. Nodules will be counted separately but will be included in the total 
inflammatory lesion count. At baseline, eligible subjects may have no more than two nodules. Nodules 
will be included in the statistical analysis of inflammatory lesion counts. All inflammatory lesions will be 
counted at the same time  rather than counting papules and pustules separately. The Evaluator will also 
count the total number of non -inflammatory lesions (open and closed comedones).  The same blinded 
evaluator should perform the lesion counts and EGSS evaluations at all visits f rom baseline to week 12 for 
the same subject . 
Inflammatory lesions  are defined as follows :  
Papule: An erythematous, raised, palpable lesion less than 5 mm in diameter  
Pustule: An erythematous, raised, likely palpable lesion containing white exudate or pus  less than 5 mm in 
diameter  
Nodule: A deep -seated, erythematous, firm lesion greater than 5 mm in diameter  
Non-inflammatory lesions  are defined as follows:  
Open comedone (blackhead): A widely dilated sebaceous follicle plugged with darkly pigmented sebum  
Closed comedone (whitehead): A small, closed sebaceous follicle distended with sebum, with a white 
appearance  
Evaluator’s Global Severity Score (EGSS)  
At each visit the severity will be determined based on evaluator -blinded evaluations of the signs and 
symptoms of acne vulgaris. Evaluations will be scored on a scale of 0 -4, with 0 being clear and 4 being 
severe.  Please see the table below for complete definitions.  
Score  Grade  Description  
0 Clear  Normal, clear skin with no evidence of acne vulgaris  
1 Almost clear  Rare non -inflammatory lesions present, with rare non -inflamed papules (papules must 
be resolving and may be hyperpigmented, though not pink -red) 
2 Mild  Some non -inflammatory lesions are present, with few inflammatory lesions 
(papules/pustules  only; no nodulo -cystic lesions)  
3 Moderate  Non-inflammatory lesions predominate, with multiple inflammatory lesions evident: 
several to many comedones and papules/pustules, and there may or may not be one 
nodulo -cystic lesion  
4 Severe  Inflammatory lesions are more apparent, many comedones and papules/pustules, there 
may or may not be up to 2 nodulo -cystic lesions  
 
Safety Assessments:  
Cutaneous safety and tolerability will be evaluated by tabulations of adverse events and Cutaneous Safety 
and Tolerability Evaluation scores (scaling, erythema,  hypo/hyperpigmentation,  itching, burning, and 
stinging) to be assessed at each study visit. Itching, burning and stinging (Cutaneous tolerability) will be 
reviewed with the subject at each study visit as a n average over the period since the previous visit. 
Scaling , erythema and hypo/hyper -pigmentation (Cutaneous Safety) will be assessed by the evaluator at 
each visit. Cutaneous tolerability signs and symptoms that result in the subject requiring a concomita nt 
therapy, interruption of treatment, or discontinuation from the study will be reported as an AE .  
At selected sites, standardized photography of the face will be performed.

 Statistical methods:  
All statistical processing will be performed using SAS® version 9.3 or later unless otherwise stated.  
Statistical significance will be based on two -tailed tests of the null hypothesis resulting in p -values of 0.05 
or less. Tests of lesion count superiority will be based on an ANCOVA with factors of treatment and 
analysis center and the respective Baseline lesion count as a covariate or on ranked data submitted to an 
ANCOVA with factors of treatment and analysis center and the respective Baseline lesion count as a 
covariate. The co -primary analysis of the dicho tomized EGSS will be based on logistic regression with 
factors of treatment group and analysis center.  The primary method of handling missing efficacy data will 
be based on estimation using the method of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC ) imputation.  
Additio nally, a model -based multiple imputation process will be used as a sensitivity analysis to the 
MCMC imputation. The absolute change in lesion count will  also be analyzed using  a repeated measures  
ANCOVA for lesion count data or repeated measures  logistic r egression model (generalized estimating 
equations) for the dichotomized EGSS.  Finally , a tipping point analysis will be performed for the primary 
endpoint s.     
Inflammatory and non -inflammatory lesion counts will be recorded for each Subject at Baseline a nd at 
Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12. The absolute and percent change from Baseline in inflammatory and non -
inflammatory lesions will be derived for each Subject at Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12.  
The EGSS will be recorded for each Subject. The EGSS will be dichotomized in to “success” and “failure” 
with a Subject considered a success if the Evaluator’s Global Severity Score at Week 2, 4, 8, and 12 is at 
least 2 grades less than baseline  and Clear or Almost Clear .  
Populations Analyzed : 
An intent -to-treat (ITT) analysis will  be conducted  on all study subj ects. The ITT population will consist 
of all randomized subjects who were dispensed  study drug . 
The safety population will be comprised of all randomized subjects who are confirmed  to have used the 
study drug  at least once. A  per-protocol (PP) analysis will also be conducted. Subjects will be eligible for 
the PP analysis if they complete the 12 -week evaluation without noteworthy study protocol violations 
(i.e., any Subject or investigator activity that could have possibly inte rfered with the therapeutic 
administration of the treatment or the precise evaluation of treatment efficacy). The PP population will 
include subjects in the safety population who do not meet any of the following criteria : 
• Failed any of the inclusion/exclusion criteria;  
• Have taken any interfering concomitant medications;  
• Did not attend the Week 12 visit ; 
• Missed more than 1 post baseline study visit prior to Week 12 ;  
• Have not been compliant with the dosing regimen (i.e. Subjects may not miss more than 
five consecutive days of dosing and must take 80 -120% of expected doses. The number of 
expected doses will be determined for each subjects based on the length of their 
participation in the study) ; 
• Out of visit window at the 12 -week visit . 
Subjects who discontinue from the study due to an adverse event related to study treatment or documented 
lack of treatment effect (and/or worsening of condition)  will be included in the PP population. Prior to 
breaking the blind, other additional criteria may be added to the list to accommodate for unforeseen events 
that occurred during the conduct of the trial that result in noteworthy study protocol violations.  
Approximately 600 subjects  with moderate or severe acne will be  enrolled and randomized to  the 
following treatment groups:  
• 300 subjects to receive IDP-120 Gel, once -daily application  
• 300 subjects to receive IDP-120 Vehicle Gel, once -daily application  
Subject demographic and baseline characteristics will be summarized by treatment group using descriptive 
statistics for the ITT, PP, and safety analysis sets.

 Efficacy  Evaluation : 
Primary efficacy  analyses will be conducted on the ITT (primary) and PP (supportive) populations.   
Secondary and supportive analyses will be conducted on the ITT popul ation.   
Primary:  
Co-primary efficacy analyses include  the absolute change  from baseline  in inflammatory and in non -
inflammatory lesions, and the dichotomized Evaluator’s Global Severity Score .  The pre -specified time 
point will be Week 12. All of the testi ng relating to the analysis of inflammatory and non -inflammatory 
lesions will use the methods introduced in Section 1 2. 
Secondary:  
Secondary efficacy endpoints include  percent change in inflammatory and non -inflammatory lesion 
counts from baseline  to Week s 12, 8 and 4 and also percentage of subjects with at least a two grade  
improvement in the Evaluator’s Global Severity Score from baseline to Week 12 .  
Supportive:  
Additional supportive efficacy endpoints includ e percent change in inflammatory and non -inflammatory 
lesions counts from Baseline at Week 2, as well as percentage  of subjects with at least a two grade 
improvement in the Evaluator’s Global Severity Score from baseline at Weeks 2, 4, and 8. 
Safety Evaluation:  
All subjects who are confirmed  to have used the study drug  at least once  will constitute the safety 
population . Safety will be evaluated by tabul ations of adverse events (AEs), Cutaneous Tolerability 
Evaluations , vital signs/abbreviated physical exams, and safety labs .  
Cutaneous Safety  Evaluation scores (erythema , scaling , and hypo/hyper -pigmentation ) and Tolerability 
(itching, burning, and stinging) will be presented with descriptive statistics at Baseline and at Weeks 2, 4, 
8, and 12 for each treatment group. Frequencies and percentag es for each outcome category will be 
included in these statistics. Mean values will be presented graphically by week and treatment group.  
Vital signs , an abbreviated physical exam, and safety labs will be conducted on all subjects at specified 
visits. For pre-menses females and females of child -bearing potential (FOCBP), urine pregnancy testing 
and serum pregnancy testing will occur at specified visits. Changes from baseline in safety laboratory 
values and vital sign measurements will be summarized with des criptive statistics for each treatment 
group at all applicable study visits. Shift tables will be presented for changes in safety laboratory values 
collected at Baseline  and Week  12 Visits . Normal ranges established by the central laboratory will be used 
to determine the shifts. A listing of all out -of-range laboratory test results at any assessment time point 
will also be provided.  
Determination of clinical significance for all out -of-range laboratory values will be made by each 
investigator and included in the listing. In addition, a listing of all clinical ly significant laboratory test 
results will be provided .  
All recorded prior and concomitant medications will be classified based on t erminology from the WHO 
Drug Dictionary. Therapies and medications data will be presented in the data listings.  
All adverse events occurring during the study will be recorded and classified on the basis of MedDRA 
terminology. Descriptions of AEs will inclu de the date of onset, the date the AE ended, the severity of the 
AE, the relationship to study drug , the action taken regarding study drug  usage, the action taken regarding 
to treat the AE, and the outcome. Adverse events will be summarized by treatment gr oup and severity.  
Each subject will be counted only once within a system organ class or a preferred term by using the 
adverse events with the highest severity within each category.  
Adverse events will be summarized by treatment group and relationship to study drug .  Each  subject will 
be counted only once within a system organ class or a preferred term by using the adverse events with the 
greatest relationship within each category .

 Comparisons among treatment groups will be made by tabulating the frequenc y of subjects with one or 
more AEs (classified into MedDRA terms) during the study.  The Fisher’s Exact test will be used to 
compare the percentage  of subjects in each treatment group who report any adverse event at a significance 
level of 0.05.  The specific system organ classes and preferred terms analyzed will be those that are 
reported by at least one percent of the subjects in any treatment group.  
All information pertaining to AEs noted during the study will be listed by subject, detailing verbati m 
given by the investigator, preferred term, system organ class, start date, stop date, severity, actions taken, 
and drug relatedness. The AE onset will also be shown relative (in number of days) to the day of initial

 5 Introduction  
Acne is a very common disorder of sebaceous follicles that usually begins at the time of the  
sharp increase in androgen production occurring in adolescence [1]. The disease is most 
prevalent amongst teenagers, but it does occur later in life, particularly in the third and fou rth 
decade. The pathogenesis is complex and involves an androgen -stimulated increase in sebum 
production, associated with follicular hyperkeratinization and obstruction of the sebaceous 
follicles. This results in abnormal desquamation of the follicular epi thelium, and is associated 
with bacterial proliferation (especially Propionibacterium acnes  (P. acnes) ) and chronic 
inflammation associated with acne. These changes in acne subjects result in enlarged 
sebaceous glands; obstruction of the follicular canal with associated sebum retention and 
distention of the follicle by tightly packed horny cells that lead to the formation clinical 
inflammatory lesions including superficial pustules such as comedones (popularly known as 
“blackheads” or “whiteheads”); and more deeply located papules, nodules and cysts [1]. The 
areas most affected by the disease include the pilosebaceous follicle s of the head and upper 
trunk, where the sebaceous glands are particularly active [2]. 
Currently, therapeutic treatment of acne is directed against 3 principal pathogenic factors of 
the disease, including the bacterial colonization of follicles, the hypersecretion of the 
sebaceous gland, and intrafollicular hypercornification that induces follicular obstruction. 
Effective treatment directed against the colonization of bacteria ( P. acnes ) in follicles has 
made use of anti -infectives such as topical benzoyl peroxide (2.5% -10%), clindamycin, and 
erythromycin and systemic tetracyclines; however, known disadvantages to this treatment 
modality include irritation and limited use due to pathogen resistance [2-5]. Effective 
treatment directed towards inhibiting sebaceous gland activit y has included oral 
corticosteroids, spironolactone, and isotretinoin in addition to anti -androgens 
(eg, cyproterone acetate). Known disadvantages to this treatment modality include being 
limited to use in females (anti -androgens), and limited to short ter m use for safety (oral 
corticosteroids). Finally, effective treatment directed against intrafollicular 
hypercornification has made use of retinoids such as oral isotretinoin and topical tretinoin or 
isotretinoin to regulate the intrafollicular keratinizati on process, inhibiting follicular 
hyperkeratinization and follicular obstruction [6]. In general, the known usefulness of oral 
retinoids (ie, oral isotretinoin) is limited by their side effects, which range from relatively 
minor effects (eg,  dryness of mucosa and skin, skin irritation, and skin scaling) to major 
toxicity syndromes (reversible hair loss, bone toxicity and teratogenicity) and may include 
varying degrees of symptoms associated with hypervitaminosis A syndrome [2, 7, 8]. 
Likewise, the efficacy of  topical retinoids such as tretinoin or isotretinoin may be limited by 
the known side effects, which include significant erythema, dryness, peeling, scaling, and 
irritation [9].

 Tretinoin and benzoyl peroxide  are retinoid prodrug s that activa te 3 members of the retinoid acid 
receptor (RAR) nuclear receptors (RARα, RARβ, and RARγ), which act to modify gene 
expression, subsequent protein synthesis, and epithelial cell growth and differentiation. Tretinoin 
and benzoyl peroxide  show  a relative sel ectivity for RARβ, and RARγ. It has not been 
established, however, whether the clinical effects of tretinoin and benzoyl peroxide  are mediated 
through activation of RARs, other mechanisms, or both. Although the mechanism of action for 
tretinoin and benzoyl  peroxide  in the treatment of acne is unknown, the drug’s 
antihyperproliferative, normalizing -of-differentiation, and anti -inflammatory effects may be 
related to the observed efficacy.  
IDP-120 Gel is packaged in a dual -chamber airless pump, with each acti ve gel contained in a 
separate cartridge. Specifically, one cartridge is filled with tretinoin (0.1%) gel, while the 
other is filled with BPO (5%) gel. The gels will be mixed (outside of the pump) immediately 
prior to topical application on affected skin. When combined, the gels dispensed from the 
pump will have a concentration of tretinoin, 0.05% (w/w) and BPO, 2.5% (w/w). This 
proposed product is the first gel formulation developed for tretinoin and benzoyl peroxide  
and will be evaluated for safety and effectiveness in treating acne vulgaris.  
6 Study Objectives and Purpose   
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate  the safety, efficacy and tolerability of a 
once -daily topical  application of IDP -120 Gel compared to IDP-120 Vehicle Gel in subjects 
with moderate to severe acne vulgaris  (a score of 3 or 4 [moderate to severe] on the 
Evaluator’s Global Severity Score ( EGSS ) scale) . 
7 Investigational plan  
7.1 Overall Study Design and Plan: Description  
This is a multicenter, randomized, double -blind, vehicle -controlled  study designed to assess 
the safety , efficacy and tolerability o f IDP -120 Gel in comparison with IDP -120 Vehicle  Gel. 
To be eligible for the study, subjects must be at least  9 years of age and older  and have a 
clinical diagnosis of moderate to severe acne vulgaris  (a score of 3 or 4 [moderate to severe] 
on the EGSS scale ). 
Approximately 600 subjects  will be enrolled into this study and randomized into one (1) of 
two ( 2) treatment groups : 
• 300 subjects  in the  IDP-120 Gel, once -daily application  group  
• 300 subjects in the  IDP-120 Vehicle Gel, once -daily application  group  
Subjects will be enrolled at approximately 24-35 independent study centers . The duration of 
treatment will be 12 weeks. Subjects will be  evaluated  at Screening, Baseline and at 
subsequent follow -up visits (Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12).

 An interactive web based response system (IWR S) will be employed to facilitate  
randomization of study subjects . Treatment assignments and study drug kit numbers w ill be 
gener ated centrally by the IWRS . At each clinical site, subject numbers will be assigned 
consecutively at the screening visit starting with 001.  
The assigned study drug will be applied topically to the face once daily  at home , in the 
evening , for 12  weeks (up to the evening prior to week 12 visit)  with the exception of study 
visit days (Baseline, Weeks 2, 4 and 8) where study drug will be applied (also by the subject) 
after the study visit is completed  at the investigational center.  The initial application will be 
applied at the investigational center as per instruction from the study coordinator or designee. 
The subjects  will be instructed to avoid exposure to direct sunlight to prevent sunburn  and 
should be instructed to use sunscr eens of at least SPF 15 and wear protective clothing ( e.g., 
hat). During post -baseline study visits (Weeks  2, 4, 8 and 12 ) the subjects will be asked to 
return the ir used pumps  of study drug and will be dispensed new pumps  of study drug (only 
Weeks 4 and 8 ; Week 2 will have no new study drug dispensed,  and Week 12 will be final 
visit) . During the study, each subject will only be permitted to use approved non-medicated 
cleansers , moisturizers  and sunscreens . 
Subjects will be asked to complete the Acne -Specif ic Quality of Life Questionnaire (Acne -
QoL, Appendix 17. 3).  The Acne -QoL will be completed at Baseline and Week 12.  
Inferential statistical analysis will not be performed on the questionnaire; the subjective 
responses will be compared between treatment g roups for trends.  
The EGSS should be completed prior to the lesion counts.  
Information on reported and observed adverse events (AEs) will be obtained at each visit. An 
abbreviated physical examination and vital sign measurements will be performed at Baseline  
and Week 12 Visits (final visit ) for all subjects.  
For all pre-menses females and female subjects of childbearing potential, urine pregnancy 
testing will be performed at Screening and confirmed at Baseline prior to randomization , and 
at Weeks 2, 4, 8 and 12 . Serum pregnancy tests will also be conducted at Baseline and Week 
12 / early termination . 
Safety laboratory testing will be conducted at Baseline and Week 12 / early termination.  
Subjects who terminate study participation early will be asked to  complete all Week 12 
assessments, as appropriate. Subjects who discontinue from the study during the treatment 
period will not be replaced.  
A “Re-screened ” subject (e.g., subject that is rescreened beyond the allowed screening period 
window)  will be considered a new subject and will need to be re -consented,  receive a new 
screeni ng number, and be entered in IWRS  as a new subject. A ll screening assessment s for 
re-screened subjects will need to be completed.

25 • Either at the investigator's request, for tolerability reasons (e .g., severe adverse 
reactions), or at the subject’s request.  
• When the requirements of the protocol are not followed.  
• When a concomitant therapy likely to  interfere with the results of the study is 
reported, or required by the subject (the investigators will report all such information 
on the source documents/ electronic case report forms ( eCRFs) and decide, in 
accordance with the sponsor, whether the subjec t is to be withdrawn).  
• When a subject is lost to follow -up. The investigators will try at least twice to reach 
the subject by telephone , email and/or text message  and will send a follow -up letter 
by certified mail before considering the subject lost to follow -up. These actions will 
be reported on the End of Study source documents , and a copy of the follow -up letter 
maintained in the investigator's file.  
All premature discontinuations and their reasons must be carefully documented by the 
investigator on source documents and the final eCRF, and, if need be, on the AE form. In any 
case, no subject who has been included and has a subject  number assigned can be replaced by 
another if they discontinue pr ematurely for whatever reason.  All data gathered on the su bject 
prior to termination will be made available to the sponsor.  
Reasons for study completion/discontinuation as listed on the final report form are defined as 
follows:  
Normal Study Completion  – Subject completes the study as planned in the protocol.  
Adve rse Event  – Complete AE form.  
Death – Complete SAE form.  
Subject Request  – Consent withdrawal, subject moved, schedule conflicts.  
Protocol Violation  – Contact the Sponsor or designee before making decision.  
Lost to Follow -Up – Document with at least 2 phon e calls , emails and/or text messages  and 
a certified letter.  
Pregnancy – Subject will discontinue study drug immediately, but will be followed to term. 
Complete pregnancy and SAE forms if applicable and report  to the same contacts using the 
same reporting procedure for an SAE under Section 11.4.6 . 
Worsening Condition  – Subject requires alternate treatment  for acne before the end of the 
study and the investigator determines it is not due to lack of efficacy.  
Lack of Efficacy  – Subject requires alternate treatment for acne after at least 2 weeks of 
study drug treatment and the risk of continuing the subject in the study outweighs the benefit 
as determined by the investigator.

who discontinue from the study during the treatment period will not be replaced.  
All subjects are free to withdraw from participating in this study at any time and for whatev er 
reason, specified or unspecified, and without prejudice. No constraints will be placed on ordinary 
subject management, and subjects, when appropriate, will be placed on other conventional 
therapy upon request or whenever clinically necessary as determin ed by their physician.  
9 Treatment  Plan  
9.1 Methods of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups  
This is a double -blinded study, in which the identity of the study drug will be unknown to 
investigator/evaluator and subjects, as well as all individuals closely associated with the study.  
Subjects will be randomized to 1 of the 2 treatment groups in a ratio of 1:1 (IDP -120 [tretinoin 
0.05% and benzoyl peroxide  2.5%] Gel: IDP-120 Vehicle Gel). Each screened sub ject will be 
assigned a unique 6 -digit study subject nu mber assigned by the investigational cen ter, which will 
consist of the 3 -digit investigational center /site number (pre-assigned by spon sor/designee)  and 
the 3 -digit chronological screening order number, starting with 001 ( e.g., 101001, 101002). The 
study d rug kit s will be assigned to subjects based on a randomization code , and a kit will be 
dispen sed to the subjects by the IR WS at Baseline, Week 4 and Week 8 visits . A study drug log 
will document the inventory and dispensing of study drug at each investigational center.  
9.2 Randomization and Blinding  
The study drugs will be packaged and labeled identically, and the study drug kits will be 
numbered sequentially and dispensed randomly via IWRS to the subjects entering the study 
within each investigationa l center. Study drug supplies will be distributed to the investigational 
centers to maintain the randomization ratio within each investigational center.  
As a double -blinded study, the investigators, the site staff, the sponsor, and the clinical monitors 
will not be aware of the treatment assigned to the individual study subjects. Delegated staff 
members at each investigational center will dispense the study drugs and will collect all used and 
unused study drug pumps  as scheduled.  
Protocol V01 -120A -302, IDP -120           Valeant Research & Development  
 
Version 3.0, 29 August 2019   CONFIDENTIAL  
27 9.3 Unblinding  
The treatment a ssignments for all enrolled subjects will be unblinded only after the conclusion of 
the study. Specifically, the blind will be broken only after all data are verified, entered into the 
database, and validated; subject evaluability assessments are performed  and entered into the 
database; and the database is locked.  
In the case of a medical emergency, the investigator can break the blind for the subject involved 
preferably by first discussing the situation with the medical monitor and the sponsor (or 
designee ) immediately. After confirmation, the investigator will be contacted with unblinding 
information by a sponsor representative  or via IWRS . The investigator will record the code break 
in the subject’s source documents.  
9.4 Prior and Prohibited Concomitant Medic ation or Therapy  
Any concomitant medication or therapy  stopped for washout as indicated below is to be 
recorded. As noted in the exclusion criteria, there are mandatory washout periods and restrictions 
during the study  for the following topical or physical  treatments on the face that have a known 
beneficial effect for acne vulgaris:  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If the subject requires topical treatment for acne on areas other than the face (e.g., chest and/or 
back), the investigator may prescribe a product that does not contain tretinoin or BPO, and note 
in the source documents and eCRF.   
In addition there is a mandatory wash out period and restrictions during the study for the 
following systemic drugs:  
Corticosteroids (including intr amuscular injections)  
(inhaled corticosteroids are allowed)  4 weeks  
Antibiotics  4 weeks  
Other systemic acne treatments  4 weeks  
Systemic retinoids  6 months  
 Topical astringents and abrasives (including comedone removal strips) on 
face 1 week  
Non-allowed moisturizers or sunscreens on the face  1 week  
Antibiotics on the face  2 weeks  
Other topical anti -acne drugs on  the face (e.g., BPO, salicylic acid)  2 weeks  
Soaps containing antimicrobials on the face  2 weeks  
Anti-inflammatory agents and corticosteroids on the face  4 weeks  
Retinoids, including retinol on the face  4 weeks  
Facial procedures, including chemical peel, microdermabrasion, light 
(PDT, LED) and laser therapy, and acne surgery  4 weeks

Version 3.0, 29 August 2019   CONFIDENTIAL  
28 Subjects using concomitant medications or therapies during the course of the study that could 
interfere with the interpretation of the study results (including but not limited to those listed 
above) should not be withdrawn, but the use of the concomitant product should be discontinued. 
No other to pical and/or physical treatment (except as noted above) other than the study drug will 
be permitted  for acne . 
Information on concomitant medications or therapies  will be recorded in the Prior and 
Concomitant Medication or Therapy source document  and eCRF . Any therapy  used by the 
subject will be considered concomitant therapy (e.g., facial procedures, surgical procedures, 
investigations and operations) , and any medication , either  over the counter (OTC) or 
prescription , used by the subject will be considere d concomitant medication (e.g., aspirin, 
Tylenol , birth control pills, vitamins ). Every attempt should be made to keep concomitant 
medication and therapy dosing constant during the study. Any change to concomitant medication 
or therapy should be noted on t he Concomitant Therapy or Medication source document and  
eCRF.  
All cleansers,  moisturizers , sunscreens  and other topical products used on the treatment area that 
are non-medicated  will be captured on  the Concomitant Therapy  source document and eCRF. 
Subjec ts must use Inve stigator approved cleansers, moisturizers , and sunscreens . 
Subjects should avoid excessive UV exposure by such activities as sun bathing or tanning 
booths . Subjects should be instructed to use sunscreens of at least SPF 15 and wear protecti ve 
clothing during the day ( e.g., hat). In addition, subjects should be instructed to not use study drug  
on skin that may have become eczematous (on the face) during the course of the study.  
9.5 Treatment Compliance  
Each subject will be instructed on the importance of returning his or her study drug at each 
applicable study visit. If a subject does not return his or her study drug, he or she will be 
instructed to return it as soon as possible. The subjects will bring the pumps  dispensed at each 
treatment visit to the next subsequent study visit. Each pump  will be weighed on a calibrated 
scale (with the cap on) to the nearest 0.1 gram  by a study coordinator or designee prior to 
dispensation and after collection. The sub ject will also be asked to complete a diary calendar and 
questioned regarding the study drug use since the previous visit in order to judge the subject’s 
compliance with applying the study drug. A subject who deviates significantly from the 
prescribed appl ication amount will be counseled. Any missed applications of study drug will be 
noted  by the subject on the diary, which will be collected and placed  in the appropriate source 
document. Missed applications will be documented in the eCRF.   
9.6 Protocol Deviatio ns and Violations  
The investigators must read the protocol thoroughly and must follow the instructions exactly.  
Protocol V01 -120A -302, IDP -120           Valeant Research & Development  
 
Version 3.0, 29 August 2019   CONFIDENTIAL  
29 A deviation from the protocol is an unintended and/or unanticipated departure from the 
procedures and/or processes approved by the sponsor and t he IRB/IEC and agreed to by the 
investigator. Deviations usually have an impact on individual subjec ts or a small group of 
subjec ts and do not involve inclusion/exclusion or primary endpoint criteria.  
A protocol violation occurs when there is non adherence  to the protocol that results in a 
significant, additional risk to the subject , when the subject  or investigator has failed to adhere to 
significant protocol requirements (inclusion/exclusion criteria) and the subject  was enrolled 
without prior sponsor  approval, or when there is non adherence to FDA regulations and/or ICH 
GCP guideline s. 
The investigator or designee must document and explain in the subjec ts’ source documentation 
any deviation from the approved protocol. The investigator may implement a deviation from, or 
a change of, the protocol to eliminate an immediate hazard to study subjec ts without prior 
IRB/IEC approval. As soon as possible after such a n occurrence, the implemented deviation or 
change, the reasons for it, and any proposed protocol amendment(s) should be submitted to the 
IRB/IEC for review and approval, to the sponsor for agreement, and to the regulatory authorities, 
if required.

10.1.1  Packaging and Labeling  
IDP-120 Gel and the IDP-120 Vehicle Gel will be supplied in subject kits . Instructions will be 
provided to the study drug technician responsible at the clinical sites. When a subject is 
randomized into the study, the kit number will be assigned to  be used for that randomized subject 
by the IWR S. Each subject kit will contain one pump , which has  30 grams  of study material. A 
new subject kit will be assigned to a subject at each of the following visits: Baseline, Week 4 and 
Week 8. The subjects will be dispensed one kit at Baseline as assigned in the IWRS . The pumps  
will be weighed on a calibrated scale (with the cap on) to the nearest 0.1 gram  prior to 
dispensing. The s ubject will bring the pump  to the next study visit  (Week 2), where it will be 
collected and weighed  to the nearest 0.1 gram  – a new pump  will not be dispensed at this visit. 
The subject will then bring the same pump  to the subsequent study visit (Week 4),  where it will 
be collected and weighed  to the nearest 0.1 gram ; one n ew pump  will be dispensed again by the 
IWRS  at Week 4 , weighed to the nearest 0.1 gram  and provided to the subject . The same will 
occur at the Week 8 visit . If the subject loses a pump  or damage s the pump , a replacement  kit 
will be dispensed  via IWRS . Each  pump  dispensing will be documented on the drug 
accountability log.    
Each subject kit (and pump ) will have a double  panel label.  Labels may contain , at a minimum,  
the following information:

10.1.2  Storage, Handling, and Disposal of Study Drug  
The study drug should be stored at  controlled room temperature 20°C to 25°C (68°F to 77°F) with 
excursions permitted between 15°C to 30°C (59°F to 86°F) , and should not be refrigerated.  All 
unused study drug will be sent back to the Sponsor or Sponsor designee upon study completion 
for documented disposal.  
10.1.3  Administration  
The assigned study drug  will be applied topically to the face once a day  at home, in the evening , 
for 12 weeks (up to the evening prior to week 12 visit ), with the exception of study visit days 
(Baseline, Weeks 2, 4 and 8) , where study drug will be applied by the subject after the study visit 
is completed at the investigational center.  Study drug will be applied as a thin layer  that is gently 
rubbed in to the skin. Study drug  use will  be limited to the face.   
The Investigator and/or trained investigational center staff member will instruct the subject on 
the proper application procedure of  the study drug to the treatment area  at the Baseline visit (see 
Appendix 17.1) . All s ubjects will be instructed to apply study drug  at approximately the sa me 
time every day in the evening  for 12 weeks  (up to the evening before the  Week 12 visit)  after 
cleansing. On study visit days (Baseline , Weeks 2, 4 and 8) subjects should be instructed to wait 
until after their study visit is completed to apply study dru g at the investigational site (note, this 
will affect evening application times on study visit days, which is acceptable . Subjects should n ot 
apply another dose of study d rug in the evening on the study visit days ). No time interval  
between dosing and meals or any other activity is specified.

Version 3.0, 29 August 2019   CONFIDENTIAL  
32 During daily application, subjects will be instructed to gently wash their face with an 
Investigator approved, non -medicated cleanser and warm (not hot) water. After washing, the 
subjects will be asked to thoroughly rinse and gently pat their face dry. The subjects should use 
the pump to dispense the study drug into their palm (two depressions of the pump into the palm 
of their hand). Study staff will highlight the importance of proper depressio n of the pump by 
using one or two fingers placed directly on the indented center of the pump head  to dispense 
study product . Upon completing two depressions of the pump and with study product in the palm 
of their hand, subjects will be instructed to blend the two colored gels in their palm until one 
uniform color is observed. This blended gel should then  be dotted on to 6 areas (chin, left cheek, 
right cheek, nose, left forehead, right forehead) on the face. After distributing the gel in this 
manner the sub ject should gently rub the gel into the skin. This amount of drug should be 
sufficient to cover the entire face excluding the mouth, eyes, inside the nose, and lips. It is 
important for the subject to treat their entire face (excluding the mouth, eyes and lips) and they 
should be instructed NOT to treat only specific lesions. They should gently smooth the test 
material  over the face evenly. The test material  should become invisible almost immediately 
following application with gentle rubbing. If this does n ot happen, the Investigator should 
instruct the subject on the use of a smaller dosage.  The subject should wash his/her hands  after 
applying the investigational product to the face . Subjects should also be instructed to place the 
cap back onto the pump aft er every use.  
The subjects will be instructed to continue using the same Sponsor /Investigator  approved non-
medicated facial cleanser , moisturizer and sunscreen and not to change products during the 
study. At each visit, subjects are to be asked if they hav e changed their cleansing routine. Facial 
makeup may be applied according to the subject’s normal daily routine; however, subjects 
should be instructed not to wear make -up during study visits as it may interfere with the 
evaluator’s assessments. Subjects m ust also agree to use non -comedogenic makeup during the 
study if they use makeup. No other products should be used on the face.  Subjects should be 
instructed to minimize sun exposure and to use Sponsor /Investigator -approved, non -medicated 
sunscreens of at least SPF 15 and to wear protective clothing during the day ( e.g., hat). Subjects 
should also be instructed to not use study treatment on skin that may have become eczematous 
(on the face) during the course of the study.  
Subjects should be instructed to s tore the study drug  at room temperature.  If a subject loses or 
misplaces the pump  cap at any point during the study, the subject should contact the study site to 
return the exposed pump  and receive a replacement  pump .   
10.2 Study Drug Accountability  
Upon recei pt of the study drug, the Investigator is responsible for ensuring that the designated 
investigational center staff member will conduct a complete inventory of study materials and 
assume responsibility for their storage and dispensing. In accordance with federal regulations, 
Protocol V01 -120A -302, IDP -120           Valeant Research & Development  
 
Version 3.0, 29 August 2019   CONFIDENTIAL  
33 the investigators must agree to keep all study materials in a secure location with restricted access. 
The Investigator will keep a record of the inventory and dispensing of all study drug. This record 
will be made available to the sponsor’s monitor for the purpose of accounting for all clinical 
supplies. Any significant discrepancy and/or deficiency must be  recorded with an explanation.  
All supplies sent to the Investigators will be accounted for and, in no case, used in any 
unauthorized situation. Pumps  will be weighed on a calibrated scale to the nearest 0.1 gram  (with 
the cap on) before dispensing to and upon return by the subjects, and weights will be recorded on 
the pharmacy log and appropriate eCRF. All used and unused supplies will be returned to 
sponsor/designee  for destruction at the conclusion of the study  as per sponsor’s direction . 
11 Study Procedure s and Evaluations  
All subject information and data obtained during the study visits will be recorded in the source 
documents, applicable study logs, and eCRFs . 
Evaluators must have appropriate, documented experience and training, or obtain approval from 
the sponsor based on experience (or through additional training organized by the sponsor).  
At each study visit, every attempt should be made to ensure that the same investigator  / evaluator 
assesses the same subject.   
11.1 Schedule of Evaluations and Procedures  
11.1.1  Visit 1: Screening Visit  (Day -35 to 0)  
The following procedures will be conducted at this visit:

11.2 Evaluation of Efficacy  
The determination of efficacy wil l be based on evaluator -blinded assessments of the signs and 
symptoms of acne vulgaris. Evaluators must be a board -certified/board -eligible dermatologist or 
have appropriate documented experience and training, and be present for formal study training 
and v alidation at the Investigator Meeting (and/or Site Initiation Visit), or obtain a waiver from 
the Sponsor based on experience (or through additional training organized by the Sponsor).  
The EGSS scores and lesion counts will be performed at each study visi t. The EGSS scores will 
be collected before  the Lesion Counts. All Subject assessments will be performed by a trained 
and validated Evaluator. Every effort should be made to have the same evaluator assess the same 
Subject at each visit. If this is not poss ible, every effort must be made for the same Evaluator to 
assess the Subject at both the B aseline and Week 12 visits.  
11.2.1  Evaluator’s Global Severity Score (EGSS ) 
The Evaluator’s Global Severity Score (EGSS) will be a static assessment that is independent of 
the baseline score. The investigator will make the assessment without referring to the baseline 
value. Every effort should be made for the same evaluator to perform each study assessment for 
the same study subject, for consistency in evaluations.  
Subjects  are eligible if they have acne with a global severity of a 3 (moderate) or a 4 (severe) on 
the EGSS a t the B aseline visit. The following scores will be used to describe the severity grade 
and subsequent score:  
Table 4.  Evaluator’s Global Severity Score  
Score Grade  Description  
0 Clear  Normal, clear skin with no evidence of acne vulgaris  
1 Almost 
Clear  Rare non -inflammatory lesions present, with rare non -inflamed papules (papules must 
be resolving and may be hyperpigmented, though not pink -red 
2 Mild  Some non -inflammatory lesions are present, with few inflammatory lesions 
(papules/pustules only; no nodulocystic lesions)

Version 3.0, 29 August 2019   CONFIDENTIAL  
40 3 Moderate  Non-inflammatory lesions predominate, with multiple inflammatory lesions evident: 
several to many comedones and papules/pustules, and there may or may not be one 
nodulocystic lesion  
4 Severe  Inflammatory lesions are more apparent, many comedones and papules/pustules, there 
may or may not be up to 2 nodulocystic lesions  
 
11.2.2  Lesion Counts  
The facial area lesion counts will be taken from the subject’s face  (including the nose) . The 
lesion count groups will be inflammatory and non -inflammatory. Facial inflammatory lesions 
(pustules, papules, and nodules) will be counted as follows: pustules and papules will be counted 
and recorded together, not separately; nodular lesions will be counted and recorded separately. 
Non-inflammatory lesions (open and closed comedones) will be counted and recorded together. 
The lesions counts will be collected at each visit and/or upon disconti nuation. The following are 
definitions of each lesion type counted:  
Inflammatory lesions  are defined as follows:  
Papule:  An erythematous, raised, palpable lesion less than 5 mm in diameter  
Pustule:  An erythematous, raised, likely palpable lesion containing white exudate or pus less  
than 5 mm in diameter  
Nodule:  A deep -seated, erythematous, firm lesion greater than 5 mm in diameter  
 
Non-inflammatory lesions  are defined as follows:  
Open comedon e (blac khead):   A widely dilated sebaceous follicle plugged with darkly  
pigmented sebum  
Closed comedone (whitehead):  A small, closed sebaceous follicle distended with sebum, with  
a white appearance  
 
11.2.3  Other Assessments  
Photography  
At select sites, photographs of the face  will be taken at Baseline and at Weeks 2, 4, 8 and 12. 
Only  subjects who provide written photographic consent for facial photographs  will be included 
in photography.  
11.3 Evaluation of Safety  
Safety assessments will be conducted at baseline and each su bsequent visit.  
11.3.1  Cutaneous Safety Evaluations  
Cutaneous safety will be evaluated through assessment of scaling, erythema, hypo -pigmentation 
and hyper -pigmentation at the drug -application site at the time of the visit. Cutaneous tolerability 
will be evaluated through assessment of selected local signs and symptoms at the drug -
application site: itching, burning and stinging,  as an average since  the last visit.

11.3.3  Medical History and Abbreviated Physical Examination  
A medical history will be taken at Screening , and confirmed and revis ed if needed, at Baseline. 
Medical histories having resolved two or more years before Baseline need not be collected unless 
considered relevant by the investigator.  
An abbreviated physical examination including measurements of heigh t and weight , and vital 
signs (blood pressure, heart rate, respiration rate, and oral temperature) wil l be performed at 
Baseline  and Week 12  (end of treatment/study ). Any abnormal physical exam findings will be 
recorded . Note: Height measurement will only be performed at Baseline . 
11.3.4  Laboratory Tests  
Clinical laboratory analyses (CBC/Diff and serum chemistry) will be conducted on blood 
samples collected from subjects at Baseline  and Week 12 visit. All results will be reported, 
including results that are abnormal. Clinicall y significant results, in the opinion of the 
investigator, should be reported as AEs.  If an AE should require laboratory testing, the results of 
the test must be obtained by the investigative site and filed in the subject’s documentation .  
For pre-menses f emales and females of childbearing potential, a serum pregnancy test will be 
conducted at Baseline and Week 12.  
11.3.5  Pregnancy Tests  
All pre-menses females and female subjects of childbearing potential will undergo serum 
pregnancy testing at Baseline  and Week 12. In addition, urine pregnancy testing wil l be 
performed at Screening, prior to randomization at Baseline, and at Weeks 2, 4, 8 and  12. The 
urine pregnancy tests will be supplied by the CRO  or CRO vendor . 
11.4 Adverse Events  
11.4.1  Definition of Adverse Event  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject 
administered a medicinal product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with 
the study drug. AEs include any unfavorable and unintended illness, sign , symptom, clinically 
significant laboratory test abnormality, or disease temporally associated with the use of a 
Protocol V01 -120A -302, IDP -120           Valeant Research & Development  
 
Version 3.0, 29 August 2019   CONFIDENTIAL  
43 medicinal product that has appeared or worsened during the course of the clinical trial, regardless 
of causal relationship to the study drug(s ) under study. AEs include any illness, sign, symptom, 
or out -of-range and clinically significant laboratory finding that has appeared or worsened during 
the course of the clinical trial, regardless of causal relationship to the study.  The collection of 
non-serious AEs and serious adverse events (SAEs) will begin following the subject's 
completion of the consent process to participate in the study.  
11.4.2  Documenting Adverse Experiences  
It is the responsibility of the investigator to document all AEs that occur du ring the course of the 
study. The AEs should be documented as a single medical diagnosis. When this is not possible, 
the AE should be documented in terms of signs and/or symptoms observed by the investigator or 
reported by the subject at each study visit.  Each AE which appears to be independent of any prior 
event will be reported separately.  
All AEs occurring after the subject signs the informed consent through the last study visit must 
be reported, regardless of whether or not the AEs are considered drug -related. All AEs, whether 
in response to a query, observed by the study site personnel, or reported spontaneously by the 
subject, will be recorded.  Any AEs deemed related to treatment reported or observed at the final 
study/treatment visit will be followed until stabilization or resolution (or up to 30 days after final 
study visit).  
At each visit during the study, the subject will be assessed for the occurrence of new and ongoing 
AEs. Cutaneous tolerability signs and symptoms that result in the subject’s req uiring a 
concomitant therapy , interruption of treatment,  or discontinuation from the study will be reported 
as an AE. The following data will be collected on all AEs and recorded on the appropriate eCRF:  
• Event name (diagnosis preferred, if unknown, record the signs/symptoms)  
• Onset date and end date  
• Maximum intensity (severity)  
• Seriousness  
• Action taken regarding study drug  
• Corrective treatment, if given  
• Outcome  
In addition, the investigator’s assessment of causality will be recorded.  
Vital sign abnormalities  are to be recorded as AEs only if they are clinically significant (for 
example: are symptomatic, requiring corrective treatment, leading to discontinuation or fulfilling 
a seriousness criterion).  
Protocol V01 -120A -302, IDP -120           Valeant Research & Development  
 
Version 3.0, 29 August 2019   CONFIDENTIAL  
44 11.4.3  Serious Adverse Events  
All AEs will be assessed as either serious or non -serious.  
An SAE or serious adverse event  is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that at any 
dose:  
• Results in death  
• Is immediately life threatening, (the term "life threatening" in the definition of 
"serious" refers to an event in whic h the subject is at risk of death at the time of the 
event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it 
were more severe)  
• Requires in patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization 
(hospitalization for elective surgery for a baseline condition is not considered an AE)  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (permanent or substantial 
disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions)  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth def ect 
• Is a medically important event that may not be immediately life threatening or result 
in death or hospitalization, but may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or 
surgical intervention to prevent one of the above listed outcomes . Examples of such 
events include, but are not limited to, allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive 
treatment in an emergency room or at home; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do 
not result in inpatient hospitalization . 
Note: A spontaneous abortion , electi ve aborti on and an ectopic pregnancy  will be considered  
SAE s, and must be reported per Reporting of SAEs under Section 11.4.6 . 
11.4.4  Assessment of Severity  
The severity assigned to an AE should be determined by the maximum severity of the AE. The 
categories described below should be used to estimate the severity of AEs:  
• Mild: Awareness  of a sign of symptom but is easily tolerated, requires no treatment 
and does not interfere with subject’s daily activities  
• Moderate: Low level of concern to the subject and may interfere with daily activities, 
but can be relieved by simple t herapeutic care

45 11.4.5  Assessment of Causality  
The investigator should assess the relationship of the AE, if any, to the study drug as either 
“Related” or “Not Related”. The following should be taken into account when assessing AE/SAE 
causality:  
Related:  There is at least a reasonable possibility that the AE/SAE is related to the study drug. 
Reasonable possibility means that there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship b etween the 
drug and the AE.  
 
Not Related:  There is little or no reasonable possibility that the AE/SAE is related to the study 
drug. This assessment implies that the AE/SAE has little or no temporal relationship to the study 
drug and/or a more likely or ce rtain alternative etiology exists.  
11.4.6  Reporting of Serious Adverse Events  
Adverse events classified as “serious” require expeditious handling and reporting to sponsor or 
designee within 24 hours of investigational center notification to comply with regulatory  
requirements.  
All SAEs, whether related or unrelated to study drug, must be immediately reported to the 
medical monitor  and CRO contact  within 24 hours of the investigator’s awareness of the event. 
All SAEs must be reported via confirmed facsimile  or email  transmission and must be submitted 
on a written SAE report form signed by the investigator within 24 hours of the investigator’s 
awareness of the event.  
The contact(s)  for reporting an SAE are: 
Investigators should not wait to receive additional information to fully document the event 
before notifying Medical Monitor  and Sponsor  of an SAE. If only limited information is initially 
available, follow -up reports are requ ired. Additional relevant information such as hospital 
records and autopsy reports should be provided to the Sponsor  as soon as they are available. 
Should the investigator become aware of an SAE (regardless of its relationship to investigational 

Protocol V01 -120A -302, IDP -120           Valeant Research & Development  
 
Version 3.0, 29 August 2019   CONFIDENTIAL  
46 product) t hat occurs within 30 days after stopping the study drug, the SAE must be reported in 
accordance with procedures specified in this protocol.  
All deaths of subjects, regardless of cause, and which are known to the Investigator will be 
reported on the appropr iate eCRF for up to 30 days after the administration of study drug, 
regardless of the Investigator's opinion regarding drug relationship. Documentation of the 
subject’s cause of death and a copy of the autopsy or hospital report will also be provided. The 
Medical Monitor  and CRO contact  must be notified within 24 hours of knowledge of the event 
by telephone (and/or facsimile/ email) of all subject deaths. Written follow -up must be received 
by the medical monitor and the Institutional Review Board /Independent  Ethics Committee 
(IRB/IEC)  within five (5) calendar days of initial notification.  
 
The investigator should take all appropriate measures to ensure the safety of the subjects, notably 
he/she should follow a subject with an SAE until the event has resolved or the condition has 
stabilized. This may imply that follow -up will continue after the subject has left the study, and 
that additional investigations may be requested by the Sponsor . When a SAE persists at the end 
of the study, the Investigator will conduc t follow -up contacts with the subject until the 
Investigator/Sponsor agree the event is satisfactorily resolved and/or stabilized. If at any time 
after 30 days after administration of study drug, the investigator becomes aware of an SAE 
which he/she feels is related to study drug or procedure, this must also be reported immediately 
(within 24 hours of knowledge of occurrence) by telephone and confirmed facsimile 
transmission/email to the Medical Monitor and Sponsor  and/or Sponsor designee.  
11.4.7  Expedited S erious  Adverse Event R eports  
An AE, whether serious or non -serious, is designated unexpected (unlabeled) if it is not reported 
in the clinical safety section of the Investigator Brochure or if the event is of greater frequency, 
specificity or severity.  
Expedited  SAE reports are those that are both unexpected based on the reference document 
(Investi gator Brochure ) and are related ( ie, the relationship cannot be ruled out) to the study 
drug. These expedited reports are subject to reporting timelines of 7 and/or 15 calendar days to 
the regulatory reporting agency(ies). The Sponsor  will notify regulatory authorities of these AEs 
and all participating investigational centers in writing for submission by the investigator to the 
IRB/IEC. This notification will be in the form of a Safety Update to the Investigator Brochure 
(ie, “15 -day letter”).  
Upon receiving such notices, the investigator must review and retain the notice with the 
Investigator Brochure and immediately submit a copy of this information to the responsible 
IRB/IEC according to local regulations. The investigator and IRB/IEC will determine if the 
informed consent requires revision. The investigator should also comply with the IRB/IEC 
procedures for reporting any other safety information.

47 11.4.8  Pregnancy  
All pre-menses females and female subjects of childbearing potential must use an effective 
method of birth control during the course of the study, in a manner such that risk of contraceptive 
failure is minimized. Abstinence is allowed as a birth control method.  
Befor e enrolling a pre-menses female or female subject of childbearing potential in this clinical 
trial, the investigator must review the following information about study participation:  
• Informed consent requirements  
• Contraceptives in current use  
Following review of this information and appropriate subject counseling, the investigator or 
designee and the subject must sign the informed consent before study enrollment.  
During the study, all female subjects of childbearing potential should be instruct ed to contact the 
investigator immediately if they suspect they might be pregnant (eg, missed or late menstrual 
period).  
If a subject or investigator suspects that the subject may be pregnant prior to study enrollment, 
the study drug must be withheld until  the results of laboratory pregnancy testing are available. If 
pregnancy is confirmed, the subject must not receive study drug and must not be enrolled in the 
study. If pregnancy is suspected while the subject is receiving study treatment, the study drug 
must immediately be withheld until the result of pregnancy testing is known. If pregnancy is 
confirmed, the study drug will be permanently discontinued and the subject will be followed 
until the pregnancy comes to term. A Pregnancy Report form will be submi tted to the sponsor, 
initially and at the end of the pregnancy, which includes the outcome of the pregnancy and any 
complications occurring during the pregnancy or the delivery.  
All confirmed pregnancies must be immediately reported to the medical monitor and CRO 
contact within 24 hours of the investigator’s awareness of the pregnancy. All confirmed 
pregnancies are to be reported on a pregnancy form using the same reporting  procedure for an 
SAE under Section 11.4.6 .  If a pregnancy is associated with an SAE, the event should be 
reported on an SAE form and a pregnancy form as per procedure outlined in Section 11.4.6 . 
12 Statistics  
All statistical processing will be performed using SAS® version 9.3 or later unless otherwise 
stated. Statistical significance will be based on two -tailed tests of the null hypothesis resulting in 
p-values of 0.05 or less . 
The primary method of handling missing efficacy data will be based on estimation using the 
method of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) imputation.  This method provides robust 
estimation when the pattern of missingness is arbitrary.   Additionally, the estimation will be done 
Protocol V01 -120A -302, IDP -120           Valeant Research & Development  
 
Version 3.0, 29 August 2019   CONFIDENTIAL  
48 for each treatment group separately so that the pattern of missing ness for one group does not 
influence the estimation of missing data for another group .  Groups of complete datasets 
following the estimation will  be concatenated to f orm analysis datasets for the comparative 
analyses  and subsequent imputation result inference with SAS PROC MIANALYZE. 
Descriptive statistics will also be derived from the multiply imputed datasets . 
Additionally, a model -based multiple  imputation process will be used as a sensitivity analysis to 
the MCMC imputation.  The absolute change in lesion count will also be analyzed using a 
repeated measures ANCOVA for lesion count data or a repeated measures logistic regression 
model (generalize d estimating equations) for the dichotomized EGSS . Finally, a tipping point 
analysis will be performed for the primary endpoint s. 
A statistical analysis plan (SAP), describing all statistical analyses will be provided as a separate 
document. The SAP will b e finalized prior to unblinding of the study treatments . 
Evaluations and Analyses  
Inflammatory lesions and non -inflammatory lesions will be recorded for each subject at Baseline 
and at Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12. The absolute and percent change from baseline of inflammatory 
lesions and non -inflammatory lesions will be derived for each subject at Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12.  
The EGSS will be recorded for each Subject. The EGSS will be dichotomized into “succ ess” and 
“failure” at Week 2, 4, 8 and 12 with a subject considered a success for those visits if the EGSS  
is at least 2 grades less than baseline and are Clear or Almost Clear.  
Subjects will be asked to complete the Acne -Specific Quality of Life Questi onnaire at Baseline 
and Week 12.  
All assessments will be  conducted for both ITT and PP.  
12.1 Assessment of Efficacy  
Primary, secondary, and supportive efficacy analyses will be conducted on the ITT (primary) 
population. Primary efficacy analyses will be conducted  on the  PP (supportive) population.  
12.1.1  Primary Efficacy  
There are three co -primary efficacy endpoints:  
• Absolute change in inflammatory lesion count from B aseline to Week 12  
• Absolute change in non -inflammatory lesion count from B aseline to Week 12  
• Percent age of subjects who achie ve at least a two-grade reduction at Week 12 from 
Baseline in the Evaluator's Global Severity Score and were Clear or Almost Clear  
12.1.2  Secondary Efficacy  
The secondary efficacy endpoints  will be the following : 
• Percent change in non-inflammatory lesion count from B aseline to Week 12  
Protocol V01 -120A -302, IDP -120           Valeant Research & Development  
 
Version 3.0, 29 August 2019   CONFIDENTIAL  
49 • Percent change in inflammatory lesion c ount from B aseline to Week 12  
• Percentage of subjects who have at least a 2 g rade reduction at Week 12 from 
Baseline in the Evaluator's Global Severity Score  
• Percent c hange in non-inflammatory lesion count from B aseline to Week 8  
• Percent change in inflammat ory lesion count from B aseline to Week 8  
• Percent change in non-inflammatory lesion count from B aseline to Week 4  
• Percent change in inflammatory lesion count from B aseline to Week 4  
12.1.3  Supportive Efficacy  
 The supportive efficacy endpoints will be as follows:  
• Percent change in non-inflammatory lesion count from B aseline to Week 2  
• Percent change in inflammatory lesion count from B aseline to Week 2  
• Percentage of subjects who have at least a 2 grade reduction at Week 8 from B aseline 
in the Evaluator's Global Severity Score  
• Percentage of subjects who have at least a 2 grade reduction at Week 4 from B aseline 
in the Evaluator's Global Severity Score  
• Percentage of subjects who have at least a 2 grade reduction at Week 2 from B aseline 
in the Evaluator's Global Severity Score  
12.1.4  Test of Superiority for Lesion Count Variables   
This section provides the basic model and statistical approach which is used in combination with 
the multiple imputation procedures described in Section 12.1.9 . Tests of superiority for the 
absolute change from Baseline in inflammatory and non -inflammatory lesions will be based on 
either parametric or non -parametric methods consistent with the statistical assumptions required 
to support the analyses. Specifically, the tests of superiority will be based on an ANCOVA with 
factors of treatment and analysis cent er and the respective Baseline lesion count as a covariate or 
on ranked data submitted to an ANCOVA with factors of treatment and analysis center and the 
respective Baseline lesion count as a covariate.  If the treatment -by-analysis center interaction 
effect is significant  at an alpha less than 0.10 , then the effect wil l be included in the model; 
otherwise it will be removed.  
A skewness test, based on the methods presented by J.H. Zar (1984)  [10], will be applied to the 
residuals resulting from an ANCOVA. A two -sided p -value for the skewness test significant at 
0.01 will imply the use of the non -parametric method. If a parametric analysis is indicated, the 
results of the parametric analysis will be considered the primary analysis. Should a non -
parametric analysis be indicated, the absolute or percent changes in inflammatory and non -
inflammatory lesions will be rank transformed prior to submitting them to the ANCOVA. 
Results of the rank -transformed analyses then will be considered the primary analy sis; however, 
results of the non -ranked transformed analyses will also be presented .

Version 3.0, 29 August 2019   CONFIDENTIAL  
50 12.1.5  Test of Superiority for EGSS  
The EGSS will be dichotomized into “success” and “failure” with a subject considered a success 
for those visits if the Evaluator’s Global Seve rity Score is at least 2 grades less than B aseline and 
are Clear or Almost Clear. The analysis of the dichotomized Evaluator's Global Severity Score 
will be based on a logistic regression test with factors of treatment group and analysis center.  
12.1.6  Statistica l Hypothesis Testing and Control of Multiplicity  
Statistical hypothesis testing for lesion count analyses will use the statistical model introduced in 
Section 12.1.4  and employs the methods of Section 12.1.9  regarding missing values. The 
analysis of the dichotomized Evaluator's Global Severity Score will be based on the logistic 
regression with factors of treatment group and analysis center and employs the methods of 
Section 12.1.9  regarding missing values.  
The overall Type I error will be controlled by requiring the three co-primary efficacy endpoints 
to be statistically significant. Specifically, failure of any one o f the primary efficacy endpoints 
will invalidate the statistical significance of the secondary efficacy endpoints.  
The following stepwise process will be conducted for testing the secondary efficacy endpoints in 
order to control for multiplicity. These tes ts will be performed for only the ITT population. The 
testing process will terminate whenever a statistical test for a step is not significant. All 
subsequent tests for the remaining steps will be considered not significant. The order of testing 
is:  
Step 
Number  Secondary Endpoint  
1 Percent change in non -inflammatory lesion count from B aseline to Week 12  
2 Percent change in inflammatory lesion count from B aseline to Week 12  
3 Percentage  of subjects who have a t least a 2 g rade reduction at Week 12 from 
Baseline in the Evaluator's Global Severity Score  
4 Percent change in non -inflammatory lesio n count from B aseline to Week 8  
5 Percent change in inflammatory lesion count from B aseline to Week 8  
6 Percent change in non -inflammatory lesio n count from B aseline to Week 4  
7 Percent change in inflammatory lesion count from B aseline to Week 4  
 
The following stepwise process will be conducted for testing the supportive efficacy endpoints in 
order to control for multiplicity. These tests will be performed fo r only the ITT population. In 
order to control for multiplicity , failure of any one of the secondary efficacy endpoints will 
invalidate the statistical significance of the supportive efficacy endpoints. The testing process

Version 3.0, 29 August 2019   CONFIDENTIAL  
51 will terminate whenever a statist ical test for a step is not significant. All subsequent tests for the 
remaining steps will be considered not significant. The order of testing is:  
Step 
Number  Supportive  Endpoint  
1 Percent change in non -inflammatory lesio n count from B aseline to Week 2  
2 Percent change in in flammatory lesion count from B aseline to Week 2

Baseline in the Evaluator's Global Severity Score  
4 Percentage  of subjects who have a t least a 2 grade reduction at Week 4  from 
Baseline in the Evaluator's Global Severity Score  
5 Percentage  of subjects who have a t least a 2 grade reduction at Week 2 from 
Baseline in the Evaluator's Global Severity Score  
 
12.1.7  Descriptive Statistics  
Descriptive statistics will  be presented for the following parameters by treatment group for both 
the ITT and PP populations:  
• Frequency and percent distributions of the Evaluator’s Global Severity Score at 
Baseline and Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12.  
• Frequency and percent distributions of the dichotomized Evaluator’s Global Severity 
Score at Baseline and Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12.  
• Descriptive statistics including mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and 
maximum will be used to summarize inflammatory and non -inflammatory lesion 
counts at Baseline and Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12.   
• Descriptive statistics including mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and 
maximum will be used to summarize the absolute and percent change in 
inflammatory and non -inflammato ry lesion counts at Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12 . 
12.1.8  Pooling Analysis  
The clinical study will be conducted under a common protocol for each investigational site with 
the intention of pooling the data for analysis.  Every effort will be made to promote consistency 
in study execution at each investigational site. The study is intended to be conducted in a manner 
such that a minimum of 5 subjects will be enrolled in each treatment arm for any investigator.  In 
the event that there are too few subjects in a treatment arm  for an investigator, then this 
investigator's data will be combined , within geographic region,  to achieve the desired sample 
size minimum per arm.  The combining of investigator's data will be accomplished by taking the 
investigator with the smallest enro llment and combining it with the investigator with the largest  
Protocol V01 -120A -302, IDP -120           Valeant Research & Development  
 
Version 3.0, 29 August 2019   CONFIDENTIAL  
52 enrollment . If there is a further need to combine data, then the data of the investigator with the 
second smallest enrollment will be combined with the investigator's data which had the second 
largest enrollment,  and so on.  This process will continue for all investigators who did not have a 
minimum of 5 subjects per treatment arm.  The process of combining investigator data that have 
insufficient subjects per treatment arm will result in redefi ning the groups of investigators for the 
purposes of statistical analyses.  These combined groups will be referred to as "analysis centers" 
in the statistical analyses based on ANCOVA and stratified logistic testing.  
Prior to investigating the treatment e ffect within the analysis centers, the magnitude of the site 
main effect will be investigated to determine if the main site -to-site variability is such that it 
could mask the analysis center effects. Thus, prior to pooling, the lesion count data at Week 12  
will be analyzed with an ANCOVA with factors of treatment group, site, and the interaction term 
of treatment group by site and also the percent of subjects with treatment success at Week 12 
will be analyzed with a logistic regression with factors of treat ment group, site, and the 
interaction term of treatment group by site. If the ses analyse s are not computationally feasible 
due to some sites having very few subjects enrolled, the low enrolling sites will be excluded 
from the se analy ses. 
The consistency of  treatment response will be investigated across the analysis centers subsequent 
to combining the data as described above.  Statistical tests will be conducted to identify if there 
are extreme analysis centers that could affect the interpretation of common statistical and clinical 
conclusions.  An analysis center by treatment interaction will be included in the primary variable 
analyses to test for parallel treatment effect at an alpha level of 0.10.  Change from baseline in 
inflammatory lesions and non -inflammatory lesions will be analyzed with an ANCOVA 
(unranked or ranked) with factors of treatment, analysis center, and treatment by analysis center 
interaction and the respective baseline lesion count variable as a covariate.  For the purpose of 
testing con sistency of treatment response, the dichotomized EGSS will be analyzed with a 
logistic regression procedure  with factors of treatment, analysis center, and treatment by analysis 
center interaction . Further examination will follow for any variables that hav e a significant 
ANCOVA or logistic regression interaction term.  In the event that the AN COVA or logistic 
regression interaction (referred to henceforth as the "appropriate test") p -value is less than or 
equal to 0.10, a sensitivity analysis that excludes analysis centers with the extreme efficacy result 
will be performed to determine the robustness of the treatment effect.  On the other hand, if the 
outcome of the appropriate test has a p -value greater than 0.10, then the conclusions from the 
pooled data w ill be considered to be free of the impact of extreme analysis centers . 
The first step in conducting a sensitivity analysis is to identify the extreme analysis center or 
centers that contribute to the statistical significance of the appropriate test.  The process involves 
submitting subsets of analysis centers to the appropriate test and observing the appropriate test p -
value for the subset.  Subsets with p -values greater than 0.10 for the appropriate test are 
considered homogeneous.  
Protocol V01 -120A -302, IDP -120           Valeant Research & Development  
 
Version 3.0, 29 August 2019   CONFIDENTIAL  
53 The search for an extre me analysis center begins by analyzing all subsets that can be created by 
excluding one analysis center.  If one or more of the subsets result in an appropriate test p -value 
greater than or equal to 0.10, then the analysis center excluded from the subset w ith the largest p -
value for the appropriate test is deemed to be the extreme analysis center.  
If all appropriate test subset p -values are less than or equal to 0.10, then the process will analyze 
the appropriate test for all subsets that can be created by excluding two analysis centers.  If one 
or more of these subsets generate appropriate test p -values larger than 0.10, then the analysis 
centers excluded from the subset with the largest appropriate test p -value are deemed the extreme 
analysis centers.  
Thus , the process of identifying the extreme analysis centers will continue in a stepwise manner 
by first excluding one, then two, then three, etc., analysis centers until the appropriate test p -
value exceeds 0.10.  
Once the extreme analysis center or centers have been identified, then the treatment p -values of 
the remaining analysis centers will be computed.  Inferences will be drawn from the treatment p -
value, as well as any pertinent observations regarding the extreme analysis center or centers.  
Additionall y, it is noted that this process excludes subjects from the analysis in a non -random 
manner and has an unpredictable impact on the power of the treatment effect test.  In the event 
that the treatment effect of the remaining subset is not statistically sign ificant, due consideration 
of the post -hoc aspects of the process will be given when the results are interpreted.  Conclusions 
will be presented by the sponsor as appropriate to the findings of the sensitivity analysis . 
12.1.9  Missing Efficacy Data Imputations  
Lesion Count Variable Missing Data Imputation  
Missing 12 week data will be estimated by multiple imputation and subsequently analyzed. 
Missing lesion count data will be derived for the analysis using the method of MCMC multiple 
imputation which does not rely  on the assumption of data missing at random. Additionally, the 
pattern of missing observations in each treatment group cannot influence the missing value 
estimation in the other because the imputation is being conducted independently for each 
treatment gr oup. 
Multiple imputation and subsequent analysis will involve 3 distinct phases with these principal 
tasks:  
 
1. Create a data set of subjects, one for each treatment group, with observed values and 
those needing estimation by MCMC.  The missing lesion count v alues in each data set 
will be filled in using the MCMC method 5 times to generate 5 data sets.  The resulting 
data sets for each treatment arm will be combined into one complete data set for each 
imputation.

2. For each complete data set, the absolute change in lesion counts will be computed. Each 
complete data set will be analyzed as specifi ed for the particular analysis.  
3. The results from these analyses will be combined into a single inference using SAS 
PROC MIANALYZE.  
A total of 4 random seeds will be needed to impute inflammatory lesion counts and non-
inflammatory lesion counts for the t wo treatment groups. Those 4 random seeds have been pre -
specified by using a random number generator:  
• Inflammatory Lesion Counts; IDP-120 Gel: Seed=  34116691  
• Inflammatory Lesion Counts; IDP -120 Vehicle: Seed=  1806432384

• Non-Inflammatory Lesion Counts; IDP -120 Vehicle: Seed= 655282615  
EGSS Missing Data Imputation  
A similar procedure will be used for the analyses based on percentage of EGSS successes 
wherein the ANCOVA analysis is replaced with a logistic regression analysis.  Specifically, 
missing 12 week EGSS values from which the dichotomized EGSS is derived will be estimated 
by MCMC which does not rely on the assumption of data missing at random. Additionally, the 
pattern of missing obse rvations in each treatment group cannot influence the missing value 
estimation in the other because the imputation is being conducted independently for each 
treatment group.  
The missing 12 -week EGSS values will be derived for the analysis using the method of Markov 
Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) multiple imputation. Multiple imputation and subsequent analysis 
will involve 3 principal tasks:  
  
1. Create a data set, one for each treatment group, of subjects with observed values and 
those needing estimation by MCMC.   The missing EGSS values in each data set will be 
filled in using the MCMC method 5 times to generate 5  data sets. The resulting data sets 
for each treatment arm will be combined into one complete data set by imputation.

point change from baselin e) will be computed. The 12 -week imputed EGSS  values will 
be rounded to the nearest integer value prior to evaluating the success rate. Each 
complete data set will be analyzed with a logistic regression with factors of treatment 
group and analysis center.  
4. The results from these analyses will be combined into a single inference using SAS 
PROC MIANALYZE.  
A total of 2 random seeds will be needed to impute EGSS  for the two treatment groups. Those 2 
random seeds have been pre -specified by using a random numbe r generator:  
• EGSS ; IDP-120 Gel: Seed=  923694678  
• EGSS ; IDP-120 Vehicle: Seed=  802843905  
12.1.10  Sensitivity Efficacy Analyses  
Sensitivity analyses for absolute change in lesion count  
The first sensitivity analysis for absolute change in lesion count will use a  repeated measures 
ANCOVA, with treatment, analysis center, and visit (ie, Week 4, Week 8) as independent factors 
and a covariate of baseline lesion count.  In this analysis, data from all post -baseline visits will 
be included with no imputation for missin g data.  
The second sensitivity analysis will use the model based multiple imputation method to impute 
missing data for the absolute change in lesion counts at Week 12.  Although the full details will 
be presented in the SAP, the multiple imputation will in volve 3 principal tasks:  
 
1. Missing values will be filled in 5 times to generate 5  data sets.  The imputation model 
used will be an ANCOVA with factors of treatment group and analysis center, and a 
covariate of baseline lesion count (ie, the imputation mo del will be the same as the 
analysis model). Appropriate modifications will be made should the analysis be based on 
a non -parametric method.  
2. Each complete data set will be analyzed with an ANCOVA with factors of treatment 
group, and analysis center, and  a covariate of baseline lesion count.  
3. Results from these analyses will be combined into a single inference  using SAS PROC 
MIANALYZE .

• Non-Inflammatory Lesion Counts: Seed=  1438330601  
Sensitivity analyses for EGSS  
The first sensitivity analysis for the dichotomized EGSS success will use a repeated measures 
logistic regression model (generalized estimating equations), with dichotomized EGSS success 
as the dependent variable and treatment, analysis center, and visit (ie, Week 4, Week 8) as 
independent factors.  In this analysis, data from all post -baseline visits will be included with no 
imputation for missing data.  
The second sensitivity analysis will use the model based multiple imputation method to impute 
missing data for the dichotomized EGSS data. Although the full details will be presented in the 
SAP, the multiple imputation will involve 3 principal tasks:  
1. Missing values will be filled in 5 times to generate 5  data sets.  The imputation model 
used logistic regression with factors of treatment group and analysis center (ie, the 
imputation model will be the same as the analysis mo del). 
2. Each complete data set will be analyzed with a logistic regression a factors of treatment 
group and analysis center.  
3. Results from these analyses will be combined into a single inference  using SAS PROC 
MIANALYZE . 
A total of 1 random seed will be  needed. The random seed has been pre -specified by using a 
random number generator:  
• EGSS:  Seed=  461039866  
Tipping Point Analys is 
A tipping point analysis of each primary endpoint will be performed as a sensitivity analysis  
for the handling of missing data.  
12.1.11 Subgroup Analyses  
Subset analyses will be conducted for the ITT populations for the subgroups of baseline global 
severity, gender, age, ethnicity , and race. Age will be dichotomized to less than the median age 
of subjects and greater than or equal to  the median age of subjects . An additional analysis will 
include age with categories of less than 18  and greater than or equal to 18. Subset analyses will 
be conducted on the variables absolute change from baseline in inflammatory lesions and non -
inflammat ory lesions at Week 12 as well as the dichotomized global severity score  at Week 12.  
These  analyses will contain only descriptive statistics .

57 12.1.12 Subject Self -Assessments  
Subjects will be asked to complete the Acne -Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire  (Appe ndix 
17.3).  Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize the data reported for the questionnaire. 
No inferential analyses will be conducted.  
12.2 Assessment of Safety  
Safety will be evaluated by tabulations of adverse events (AEs), Cutaneous Safety Evaluation, 
and Tolerability Evaluations. Cutaneous Safety Evaluation scores (erythema, scaling, and 
hypo/hyper -pigmentation) and Tolerability (itching, burning, and stinging ) will be presented with 
descriptive statistics at Baseline and at Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12 for each treatment group. 
Frequencies and percentages for each outcome category will be included in these statistics. Mean 
values will be presented graphically by week  and treatment group.  
12.2.1  Adverse Events  
All AEs occurring during the study will be recorded and classified on the basis of MedDRA 
terminology. Descriptions of AEs will include the date of onset, the date the AE ended, the 
severity of the AE, the relationship to study drug , the action taken regarding study drug  usage, 
the action taken to treat the AE, and the outcome. All reported treatment -emergent AEs (TEAEs) 
will be summarized by the number of Subjects reporting AEs, system organ class, preferred 
term,  sever ity, seriousness, and relationship to study drug . TEAEs are those AEs with an onset 
on or after the date of the first study drug application . 
Adverse events will be summarized by treatment group and severity.  Each subject will be 
counted only once within a system organ class or a preferred term by using the adverse events 
with the highest severity within each category . 
Adverse events will be summarized by treatment group and relationship to study drug .  Each 
subject will be counted only once within a syste m organ class or a preferred term by using the 
adverse events with the greatest relationship within each category.  
Comparisons among treatment groups will be made by tabulating the frequency of subjects with 
one or more AEs (classified into MedDRA terms) d uring the study.  The Fisher’s Exact test will 
be used to compare the percentage  of subjects in each treatment group who report any adverse 
event at a significance level of 0.05.  The specific system organ classes and preferred terms 
analyzed will be those  that are reported by at least one percent of the subjects in any treatment 
group . 
All information pertaining to AEs noted during the study will be listed by subject, detailing 
verbatim given by the investigator, preferred term, system organ class, start d ate, stop date, 
severity, actions taken, and drug relatedness. The AE onset will also be shown relative (in 
number of days) to the day of initial dose of the randomized study drug .

58 Serious adverse events (SAEs) will be tabulated by subject within treatment  groups . 
In addition, a list of subjects who discontinued from the study and a list of subjects who 
experienced SAEs will also be provided . 
12.2.2  Safety Lab oratory  Tests  
Changes from baseline in safety laboratory values will be summarized with descriptive statis tics 
at all applicable study visits. Shift tables will be presented for changes in safety laboratory 
values. Normal ranges established by the central laboratory will be used to determine the shifts. 
A listing of all out -of-range laboratory test results at any assessment time point will also be 
provided. Determination of clinical significance for all out -of-range laboratory values will be 
made by each investigator and included in the listing. In addition, a listing of all clinically 
significant laboratory te st results will be provided . 
12.2.3  Vital Sign Measurements  
Vital signs as well as c hanges from Baseline in vital sign measurements will be summarized with 
descriptive statistics for each treatment group at all applicable study visits .

WHO Drug Dictionary. Therapies and medications data will be presented in data listings.  
12.3 Subject  Disposition  
A tabulation of subject disposition will be provided . The tabulation will include the numbers of 
subjects who enter the study, complete the study, and discontinue the study. The reasons for 
discontinuation will be included.  
12.4 Demographics and Baseline Characteristics  
Subject demographic and baseline character istics will be summarized by treatment group for the 
ITT, PP, and safety  population s. For continuous variables (e.g. , age) comparisons among the two 
treatment groups will be conducted using a two -way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with factors 
of treatmen t group and analysis center . Ethnicity and race will be analyzed with a Cochran -
Mantel -Haenszel test stratified by analysis center . Past and current medical conditions, as well as 
history of disease will be presented in a data listing.

59 12.6 Compliance  
The number and percentage of subjects who are compliant in each treatment group will  be 
summarized descriptively. Subjects may not miss more than five consecutive days of dosing and 
must take 80 -120% of expected doses to be considered compliant. The number of expected doses 
will be determined for each subject based on the length of their participation in the study and will 
be capped at 89 days; the number of planned doses given a subject attended the Week 12 visit on 
the latest day within window.  
12.7 Interim Analyses  
No interim analyses are planned.  
12.8 Additional Statistical Considerations  
12.8.1  Analys is Populations  
Approximately 600 subjects  at least  9 years of age and older  with moderate or severe acne (a 
score of 3 or 4 [moderate to severe] on the EGSS scale ) will be enrolled and randomized in the 
study. With a 1:1 randomization ratio, it is anticipated that:  
• 300 subjects will be randomized to receive IDP -120 Gel, once -daily application  
• 300 subjects will be randomized to receive IDP-120 Vehicle Gel, once -daily 
application  
The intent -to-treat ( ITT) population will consist of all randomized subjects who were dispensed  
study drug . The safety population will be comprised of all randomized subjects who are 
confirmed to have used the study drug  at least once.  
An ITT analysis will be conducted as well as a per-protocol (PP) analysis. Subjects will be 
eligible for the PP analysis if they complete the 12 -week evaluation without noteworthy study 
protocol violations (i.e., any subject or investigator activity that could have possibly interfered 
with the therap eutic administration of the treatment or the precise evaluation of treatment 
efficacy). The PP population will include subjects in the safety population who do not meet any 
of the following criteria:  
• Failed any of the inclusion/exclusion criteria;  
• Have tak en any interfering concomitant medications;  
• Did not attend the Week 12 visit ; 
• Missed  more than 1 post baseline visit  prior to Week  12; 
• Have not been compliant with the dosing regimen (i.e. , Subjects may not miss more 
than five consecutive days of dosing an d must take 80 -120% of expected doses. The 
number of expected doses will be determined for each subject based on the length of 
their participation in the study);  
Protocol V01 -120A -302, IDP -120           Valeant Research & Development  
 
Version 3.0, 29 August 2019   CONFIDENTIAL  
60 • Out of visit window at the 12 -week visit.  
Subjects who discontinue from the study due to an ad verse event related to study treatment or 
documented lack of treatment effect (and/or worsening of condition)  will be included in the PP 
population.  Prior to breaking the blind, other additional criteria may be added to the list to 
accommodate for unforeseen events that occurred during the conduct of the trial that result in 
noteworthy study protocol violations.  
12.8.2  Sample Size Determination  
These power calculations are based primarily on the observed Week 12 results of the Phase 2 
study, V01 -120A-201. This study was a four -arm trial inclu ding IDP -120 Gel versus its 
individual gel components and Vehicle Gel and is therefore a relevant study fo r powering the 
current study.  
A sample size of 300 per treatment  arm has greater than 99% power to detect a statistically 
significant difference in non-inflammatory lesions with a significance level of 0.05. The 
estimated absolute change from baseline in treatment means were 13.3 and 8.7 for IDP -120 Gel 
versus its V ehicle  gel, respectively, with a standard deviation of  11.0.  
A sample size of 300 per treatment  arm has greater than 99% power to detect a statistically 
significant difference in non -inflammator y lesions with a significance level of 0.05 using the 
estimated absolute change from baseline in treatment means of 18.8 and 7.8 for IDP -120 Gel 
versus its Vehicle  Gel, respectively, with a standard deviation of 16.4.  
In order to achieve at least 95% power to detect a statistically significant difference in the 
percentage  of subjects who have at least a 2 grade reduction at Week 12 from Baseline in EGSS 
and are Clear or Almost Clear with a significance level of 0.05, a sample size of 293 per 
treatmen t group is required.  The estimated percentages with a 2 grade reduction at Week 12 
from Baseline in the EGSS and Clear or Almost Clear are 26.6% and 14.3% for IDP -120 Gel 
versus its Vehicle Gel respectively.  For simplicity, a sample size of 300 per treatm ent arm will 
be used.   
12.8.3  Handling of Missing Data  
The method of multiple imputation will be used (see Section 12.1.9 ). 
12.8.4  Multicenter Issues  
The study will be conducted at multiple investigational centers in North America  and Latin 
America with the intention of pooling the results for analysis.  Site specific data summaries, 
however, will be presented .

Version 3.0, 29 August 2019   CONFIDENTIAL  
61 12.8.5  Multiplicity Issues  
The overall Type I error will be controlled by req uiring the three co -primary efficacy endpoints 
to be statistically significant. Specifically, failure of any one of the primary efficacy endpoints 
will invalidate the statistical significance of the secondary efficacy endpoints. See Section 12.1.6  
for further detail.  
12.8.6  Windowing Rules  
The timing of all study visits is relative to Baseline (Day 0). The Week 2, Week 4 and Week 8 
visits should occur within ± 3 days of the scheduled times, the Week 12 visit should occur within 
-3 / +5 days of the scheduled time . 
13 Quality Control and Quality Assurance

68 • First Time Use of New Pump (“Priming”)  
o Priming occurs when a new pump is used – product may not immediately come out 
evenly, or at all, during the first depression (pressing ) of the pump head . This is normal.  
o Priming will be performed during scheduled on-site clinic visits  where new pumps will 
be dispensed (Baseline, Week 4 and Week 8), under the supervision of the clinic staff . 
o During priming, continue to press the top of the pump head until product comes out 
evenly from both of the nozzles. Product that has come out during priming will be 
discarded.  
• Once the pump has been primed and product is coming out from both nozzles evenly, the 
product is ready for use. Holding the pump at an angle onto the palm of your hand, fully push 
the pump head until two gels appear from both nozzles: one nozzle will dispense a yellow gel 
and the other nozzle will dispense a white gel ( Figure 3a ).  
• Repeat this one more time (two times total) to get two wh ite and two yellow gels  in the palm 
of your hand ( Figure 3b ). Figure 3c shows dispensed product in the palm of your hand. 
Note: if only one gel comes out (from one nozzle) or the gels do not come out evenly, please 
discard and repeat the above steps with two pumps of the head.  
• Carefully blend (mix) the white and yellow gels  using 5 to 10 small circular motions with 
your fingertip or until the colors are blended to give a visually uniform color (gel should now

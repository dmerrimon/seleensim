What are some general things you should know about research studies?  
You are being asked to take part in a research study.   To join the study is voluntary. You may refuse to 
join or you may withdraw your consent to be in the study, for any reason, without penalty. 
 Research studies are designed to obtain new knowledge. This new information may help people in the 
future.    You may not recei ve any direct benefit from being in the research study. There also may be risks 
to being in research studies. Deciding not to be in the study or leaving the study before it is done will not affect your relationship with the researcher, your health care provider, or the University of North 
Carolina-Chapel Hill. If you are a patient with an illness, you do not have to be in the research study in order to receive health care.  
 Details about this study are discussed below.   It is important that you understand t his information so that 
you can make an informed choice about being in this research study.   You will be given a copy of this 
consent form.  You should ask the researchers named above, or staff members who may assist them, any questions you have about this study at any time.  
 What is the purpose of this study?  
The primary aims of this study are to determine if genic ulate artery embolization (GAE) will reduce pain 
and disability (resulting from pain, stiffness and difficulty performing daily activities) caus ed by knee 
osteoarthritis (OA). Embolization is a procedure where physicians intentionally block the blood vessels to 
specific areas of the body to prevent blood flow to that region. By doing this, the decrease in blood flow 
will decrease the size of the area of interest. In this case, your physician will block the geniculate artery, 
which is located in the knee, with a go al to decrease the swelling  around the knee, resulting in 
improvement of pain, stiffness, and difficulty performing daily activities from  OA. Although 
embolization is used commonly throughout the body to treat bleeding and tumors, this technique has not yet been proven to improve OA in the knee, making this study experimental. 
 
You are being asked to be in the study because you have moderat e to severe pain that occurs in the knee 
even after at least 3 months of non- surgical therapies like medicines to reduce swelling, physical therapy, 
muscle strengthening, or injections of medicine, and have arthritis of of the knee that has been seen and 
identified by medical imaging like an MRI or X -ray. 
 
16-1969  Adult Consent Form  Page 2 of 9 Are there any reasons you should not be in this study?  
You should not be in this study if you have any of the following. 
 
1. Current local infection  
2. Life expectancy less than 6 months 3. Known advanced atherosclerosis (plaque that builds within the vessels that lead blood to the heart)  
4. Rheumatoid or infectious arthritis 
5. Prior knee surgery 
6. Iodine allergy  
7. Kidney disease  
8. Inability to tolerate or undergo MRI  
How many people will tak e part in this study?  
A total of approximately 20 people will take part in this study , including approximately 10 individuals 
from UNC.  
 How long will your part in this study last?  
You will be asked to participate for approximately 6 months of follow up. T his will include the GAE 
procedure and all follow up visits. Follow up visits will be scheduled at 1 day, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months. These visits will either in be in person, over the phone, or via teleconference. They will each last 
approximately 15 min to  2 hours. Prior to the procedure, you will also undergo some testing so that your 
physician can plan your procedure. This will include an MRI of the knee, which will last approximately 1 hour.   
What will happen if you take part in the study?  
During your initial visit, y ou will undergo the standard work-up for knee OA including a detailed history, 
physical exam,  Western Ontario and McMaster University Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) questionnaire, 
visual  analog scale (VAS), a knee radiograph (X -ray), an d an MRI of the knee.  This visit may be 
completed before enrolling in the study.  If you have had an MRI of your knee within 90 days of the research procedure, you will not be asked to have another MRI of the knee.  The WOMAC questionnaire 
will ask you about your symptoms, stiffness, pain and how it affects your ability to function.  The VAS is a scale that will allow us to compare you pain level over time between visits.    
 
Following this visit, y ou will be asked not to initiate any new pain therapy or escalate current therapy for 
1 month prior to  the GAE  procedure.  During this procedure, which is investigational, physicians 
intentionally block the blood vessels in the knee to prevent blood flow to that region. By doing this, the 
decrease in blood flow will decrease the size of the area of interest.   
 
You will likely be released from th e hospital the same day of your GAE procedure unless a complication 
arises that requires us to keep you over night. You may be given  pain medications that you can take as 
needed for two weeks or less following your procedure. 
 
After the procedure, you will have 4 follow -up that will be scheduled for 1 day, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 
months after the  procedure. At these visits, you will complete the WOMAC questionnaire and VAS pain 
score similar to your initial visit.  During your 1 month follow up visit, you will also receive an MRI of 
the knee. Most of these visits may be conducted in the clinic or by phone or teleconference.  However, the 
MRI will be obtained at the hospital.  Additional MRIs may be acquired during follow up visits if they are 
needed by your physician to guide your care. 
 What are the possible benefits from being in this study?  
Research is designed to benefit society by gaining new knowledge. The benefits to you from being in this 
16-1969  Adult Consent Form  Page 3 of 9 study may be that your pain , stiffness and difficulty performing daily activities associated with OA  may 
decrease. It  is also possible that you no long er may require other means to treat your OA such as 
medications or injections.   
 
What are the possible risks or discomforts involved from being in this study?  
There may be uncommon or previously unknown risks. You should report any problems to the research  
team . 
 
There is a minimal risk of a breach of your confidentiality.  In order to minimize this risk, you will not be 
identified by name in ant of our study data.  You will be identified by a study ID number.  This study ID 
number will be stored separately to protect your identity.  
 
Procedural discomfort or complications of geniculate artery embolization (GAE): You may experience 
pain or discomfort in the thigh or knee area where the catheter was placed from the development of bruising or the colle ction of a small amount of blood under the skin. If the pain or discomfort is severe or 
does not go away, you should contact your physician. In addition, there is a small risk of developing a skin infection at the thigh or knee.    
 
Non-target embolization resulti ng in ischemia of the leg, foot, or toes is a rare complication that may 
occur. Ischemia is a restriction of blood supply to the tissue that results in a lack of oxygen or glucose to 
those tissues. Non -targeted embolization is where an area outside of the area of interest is embolized 
(blocked)  and the tissue may be irreversibly damaged.  
 Additional risks that are anticipated but occur infrequently after any procedure that involves the arteries  
include infection, pain, swelling of clotted blood withi n the tissues that forms because of a leaking vessel , 
or a tear in the blood vessels. 
 
The use of the contrast agent during the study treatment procedure has a small chance of causing kidney damage.  
 Most of these complications resolve themselves without t reatment or can be treated with medications  that 
may be taken for a short period of time, such as antibiotics. If a long- term complication occurs, such as 
tissue loss, you will be referred to the appropriate physicians. Any costs associated with complications will be paid by you and/or your insurance company.

Unrelieved or worsening pain in knee: There is a chance that your knee pain may not improve or  
even  worsen after GAE. If this were to occur, you would be permitted to take more pain medication or 
undergo other pain treatments as needed. In this circumstance, the experimental treatment (GAE) will 
have failed to achieve the goal of this study.

MR Imaging: A standard screening form will be used to ensure that you have no contraindication to MR 
imaging. If you experience claustrophobia during the imagining, you may immediately stop the scan and exit the magnet.  Please let us know  if you feel uncomfortable at any time. 
 Additionally, the very r are complication of thickening or scarring of the skin and internal organs after 
gadolinium contrast injection , which is known as Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis. This complication has 
only occurred in patients will severe kidney problems.  We exclude individuals from our study that have 
kidney problems in order to keep the risk to you extremely low.  
 
Radiation: The GAE procedure in this study uses fluoroscopy, which is similar to an X- ray “movie.”  
Fluoroscopy projects the X-ray images on to a screen so that your physician can see the area of interest using these images during the procedure.  
 
The f luoroscopic procedure used in this study involves exposure to radiation. The estimated additional 
amount of radiation exposure that you will received in this study is 0.225 rem (rem is a unit used to measure doses of radiation). For comparison, the average person in the United States receives a radiation 
exposure of 0.3 rem per year from natural background sources.  The radiation dose that you will receive 
in this study is equivalent to the radiation exposure that everyone receives in 9 months from natural background radiation. 
 
This radiation exposure involves a small risk and is necessary to obtain the information desired. The radiation exposure described here is what you will get from this research study only. It does not include 
any exposure you may have received or will receive from other tests outside of this study that are a part of your medical care.  
 If you choose not to be in the study, what other treatment options do you have? 
If you decide not to participate in this study, your physician may suggest exercise and education, oral medication, creams, or surgery to replace damaged portions of the joint with a metal, plastic , or ceramic 
device.  Minor symptoms can be managed with medications like Tylenol, Ibuprofen, or Advil.  
 What if we learn about new findings or information during the study?  
You will be given any new information gained during the course of the study that might affect your willingne ss to continue your participation.  
 
How will information about you be protected?  
In order to protect your privacy, your information will be stored with a study number that is unique to you.  Your information will not be stored with your name or any other identifying information.  The file 
that links your identifiable information with your unique study ID will be stored separately from all research data.  Only a limited set of individuals among the research team will have access to your 
identifiable informa tion. 
 
Participants will not be identified in any report or publication about this study. Although every effort will 
be made to keep research records private, there may be times when federal or state law requires the 
disclosure of such records, including personal information.  This is very unlikely, but if disclosure is ever 
required, UNC- Chapel Hill will take steps allowable by law to protect the privacy of personal 
information.  In some cases, your information in this research study could be reviewed by r epresentatives 
16-1969  Adult Consent Form  Page 8 of 9 of the University, research sponsors, or government agencies (for example, the FDA) for purposes such as 
quality control or safety.  
 What will happen if you are injured by this research?  
All research involves a chance that something bad migh t happen to you.  This may include the risk of 
personal injury. In spite of all safety measures, you might develop a reaction or injury from being in this study. If such problems occur, the researchers will help you get medical care, but any costs for the 
medical care will be billed to you and/or your insurance company. The University of North Carolina at 
Chapel Hill has not set aside funds to pay you for any such reactions or injuries, or for the related medical 
care. You do not give up any of your leg al rights by signing this form. 
What if you want to stop before your part in the study is complete?  
You can withdraw from this study at any time, without penalty.  The investigators also have the right to stop your participation at any time. This could be because you have had an unexpected reaction, or have 
failed to follow instructions, or because the entire study has been stopped. 
 
Will you receive anything for being in this study?  
You will not be compensated for participating in this study. 
 Will it cost you  anything to be in this study?  
The experimental procedure and all follow up care will be paid for by the Sponsor. You and your insurance company will be responsible for all initial work- up costs associated with OA . These costs 
include a  physical exam and history, WOMAC questionnaire, VAS questionnaire, and a knee radiograph . 
Your physician may not order an MRI of your knee as a part of this standard workup.  Therefore, the costs associated with an MRI of the knee will be covered by the S ponsor.   We will work with you to 
schedule this MRI.  If you had an MRI within the past 90 days for clinical reasons, we will not repeat this scan and you would not be reimbursed for the MRI conducted before enrolling in the study.  Please note 
that y our treating physician may include other testing during this initial workup that are clinically 
indicated based on your medical history that would also be your responsibility.  Associated travel costs, 
including parking and lodging, will also be your responsib ility. 
 Who is sponsoring this study? 
This research is funded by Boston Scientific Corporation (the Sponsor).This means that the research team is being paid by the sponsor for doing the study.  In addition, Sandeep Bagla, the external site PI, has received  money from Boston Scientific Corporation for work that is not part of this study. These activities 
may include consulting, service on advisory boards, giving speeches, or writing reports. 
  
A review of these financial arrangements was conducted at the Uni versity of North Carolina at Chapel 
Hill.  They concluded that the possible benefit to the person(s) listed above is not likely to affect your 
safety or the scientific quality of the study.  If you would like more information, please ask the 
researchers listed on the first page of this form.

Full Title:  Mobile  Cognitive  Behavior Therapy  Targeting  Anxiety  Disorders  
Short  Title:  Mobile  CBT in Anxiety  
Clinical Phase:  N/A – no drug  or device  involved  
Principal  Investigator:  Faith  Gunning  
Sample Size:  N = 120 
Accrual  Ceiling: We plan  to screen  up to 300 subjects.  
Study  Population:  18-25 year  olds who  have  been  diagnosed  with an anxiety  
disorder  as per the Anxiety  Disorders  Interview  Schedule.  
Accrual  Period:  We anticipate  complete  accrual of participants  taking  up to 1 year  
Study  Design:  Participants  in this study  will use an online  Cognitive  Behavior  
Therapy program to assist with treatment of their anxiety  
symptoms. This program is being developed by Weill Cornell 
Medicine faculty as part of the University of Pennsylvania Center  
for Health Incentives and Behavioral Economics’s estab lished  
online platform called “Way to Health.” All participants in the  
study will be using the program; as this is a pilot study testing the  
feasibility of using an online CBT program plus non -monetary  
incentives.  Participants  will be told to use the program for at least  
20 minutes per  day, 2 days  per week, for up to 6 weeks.  
Participants will check in once a week in person or over the phone  
or a HIPAA- compliant virtual meeting platform. There will also be  
one follow up visit 6 weeks after they have stopped using the  
program.  
 
Study  Duration:  3 months  
Study  Agent/  
Intervention Description:  There  is no drug  or invasive  device being  used;  rather,  we are 
simply providing an online Cognitive Behavior Therapy program through an existing  online  platform  called  “Way  to Health”  
Primary  Objective:  The primary  objective  is to examine  different ways  of motivating  
people to make use of the online therapy program, and to assess  
whether social supports are as efficacious, or more efficacious,  
than a reward mechanism such as non- monetary incentives. We  
will randomize subjects to one of three conditions: a social  
support condition, a gain- framed condition in which participants  
can earn  “points”  for completing  their  assigned  sessions,  and a 
Protocol  # 1803019086  
Version  Date  12/27/2022  
Page  # 2  
  
loss- framed condition in which participants lose “points” for  
failing to complete their assigned sessions on time. We will 
compare change in anxiety from baseline to end of treatment between these three conditions.  
Secondary  Objectives:  A secondary  objective  will be to evaluate  whether  the three  
incentive conditions are associated with different levels of treatment engagement. We will measure the amount of time  
participants  use the program and administer a questionnaire  to 
assess participants’ subjective impressions of the program. We  
will compare these measures across the three incentive  
conditions.  
Exploratory  Objectives:  We will collect  neuroimaging  data  from  a subset  of participants  
who choose to participate in MRI scans and/or  
electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings pre-intervention and 
post - intervention. We will examine these scans for neural 
changes pre - to post- intervention. We will also assess associations 
between symptom improvement and time spent on different 
modules  within the program.  
Endpoints:  We will administer several  questionnaires  that will assess severity  
of symptoms of anxiety in order to assess the efficacy of the  
program over time.

1. Study  Objectives  
Describe  the specific  aims for the study.  
 
1.1 Primary  Objectives  
 
We plan to develop an online cognitive behavioral therapy program, in collaboration  
with the Center for Health Incentives and Behavioral Economics (Wharton School) that can 
be integrated into their online platform, Way to Health (https://www.waytohealth.org) that 
has been developed over the past 10 years and automates many of the research functions  
necessary for conducting randomized controlled trials of behavior interventions a nd 
strategic telehealth programs in areas related to primary care medicine. The platform is an  
efficient, scalable, and low cost way to test behavioral interventions. To date, the platform  
has supported NIH -funded interventions that focus on medication adherence; weight loss; 
monitoring of blood sugar, blood pressure and weight; physical activity; smoking cessation;  
sleep  and patient compliance.  
One of the key features of the online platform (Way to Health) is its capacity to embed 
various incentive tools such as gamification and social support to the CBT intervention. In 
this context, these incentive components are novel to the delivery of any CBT treatment. A  
main hypothesis to be tested in this objective is whether the social support component will  
have a particular advantage to increase efficacy of CBT in this age group. This social support  
component will potentially extend the benefits of a group therapy approach, including  
connection with others, support, and encouragement. To test this  hypothesis, we will  
randomize participants to one of three incentive structure conditions: a gain- framed  
incentive in which participants earn points for completing sessions, a loss -framed incentive  
in which they lose points for failing to complete sessions, and a social support incentive in  
which participants can identify a person they know to receive updates about their progress  
and support them throughout their time in the program. Participants will not be required to  
choose  a person  they  know to receive  updates  about their  use of the program;  instead, they  
can choose to have a member of the study team serve as their social support if they are  
assigned  to this  condition.  
 
1.2 Secondary  Objectives  
 
In addition to assessing efficacy of the three incentive strategies, a secondary objective  
is to evaluate the extent to which each strategy enhances engagement with the CBT  
intervention. Necessary to the real -world success of any technology -based health 
intervention is the frequency with which the user  interacts with the technology and the  
user’s perception of how helpful and easy to use it is; even the most well -designed  
treatment will not help anyone if people never use it. We hypothesize that the social  
support incentive strategy may increase use and enjoyment of the program. We will use  
both objective  data  collected  by the online  CBT program and subjective  ratings  reported by 
Protocol  # 1803019086  
Version  Date  12/27/2022  
Page  # 7  
  
study participants to evaluate differences in engagement between the gain- framed, loss - 
framed,  and social incentive conditions.  
 
1.3 Exploratory  Objectives  
 
We will collect neuroimaging data from a subset of participants who choose to  
participate in MRI scans and/or electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings  pre-intervention 
and post- intervention. We will examine these scans  for neural changes along with examining 
questionnaires and interviews to assess changes in symptoms pre - and post- intervention. 
We will also assess associations between symptom improvement  and time  spent on different 
modules  within the program.  
 
2. Background  
 
2.1 Disease  
 
The disease being researched is anxiety disorder, a category of psychiatric disorders  
that includes phobias, social anxiety, and panic disorders. It is characterized by  
stress that is disproportionate  to the potential  consequence  of an event, an inability  
to stop worrying, and general restlessness. It has a one -year prevalence of 10.6%  
and a lifetime prevalence of 16.6%. In addition, it has seen a rise in prevalence in  
younger  populations  in recent  years  (Remes,  2016).  
 
2.2 Investigational  Agent or Device  
 
The online CBT program will be developed with the consultation of a behavioral  
economics researcher at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School (Center for  
Health  Incentives  and Behavioral Economics; https://chibe.upenn.edu).  The program  
will be integrated into their established online platform (Way to Health;  
https://www.waytohealth.org) that includes various incentive tools.  Our program will 
include modules addressing, among others: psychoeducation, emotion monitoring tools,  
cognitive restructuring strategies, mindfulness practices, exposure hierarchy building  
and maintenance tools, an evolving list of weekly exposure goals, exposure exercise  
processing tool, and as -needed motivational enhancement and relapse  prevention 
modules. Module content will be continually updated based on ongoing patient 
assessment. For example, the exposure hierarchy will be an interactive tool with  
evolving fear and avoidance ratings based on weekly exposure exercises accomplished  
and anxiety data collected. These data will then inform recommendations for weekly  
exposure tasks, including when to repeat exposures and when to move on to a more  
challenging task. The online CBT platform will include an interactive dashboard to  
provide the  user with their program "stats" based on patient goals will be entered into  
the system; it will provide prescribed outcome measures for tracking progress toward

Page  # 8  
 goals.  Participants  will be told that they  must  engage  with the online  CBT platform  for at 
Protocol  # 1803019086  
Version  Date  12/27/2022  
Page  # 9  
  
least 20 -25 minutes per day, 2 days per week. They are allowed to use the program  
more  frequently than this if they want to. 
 
Although the proposed version of this app is new, the content and its structure  
are similar to how Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is commonly delivered. We have a 
collaboration with University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School (Center for Health  
Incentives and Behavioral Economics; https://chibe.upenn.edu) , who have an 
established online platform called Way to Health. Way to Health has been used to  
deliver interventions to thousands of patients. In 2017, the platform supported 38  
research projects and 11 clinical pilots. We are working closely with Kevin Volpp, M.D., Ph.D. at University of Pennsylvania who has demonstrated how incentives can increase  
adherence to mobile  interventions for weight loss, physical  activity, safe  driving,  
smoking cessation, among others (e.g. Patel, Volpp & Asch, 2018, NEJM; Patel et al.,  
2017, JAMA; Volpp et al., JAMA Internal Med). The productive team at Way to Health allows for quick development while maintaining a high level of rigor. All of our timeline  
goals as  we have  developed  this project have  been met  by the University  of 
Pennsylvania team so we are confident that we will have  timely delivery of the mobile  
application. 
 
2.3 Rationale  
 
There is a growing need for anxiety treatments designed for young adults (ages 18 - 
25 years of age). This age group uses mobile devices frequently, thus there is a clear  
opportunity to provide mobile treatment that is targeted for this age range. Mobile technology  
has been used to track mental health symptoms and also deliver mental -health services for  
adults with a variety of psychiatric symptoms (Dennis & O'Toole, 2014). Mobile -based  
interventions are advantageous in that they can provide momentary tailored interventions and collect real -time data about patient symptom severity (Burns et al. 2011). As a result, a goal of  
this work is to develop an effective mobile application for adolescents and young adults  
experiencing anxiety symptoms. The research team has an extensive background in  
understanding how adolescents and young adults may be more sensitive to certain types of rewards (i.e. social support), which will increase the pat ient's engagement with the mobile  
treatment. 
 
The mobile application will utilize a version of a traditional "gold -standard" 
behavioral therapy approach to treat anxiety disorders - cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)  
optimized for youth. Unlike many other types of psychotherapies, the standardized nature of CBT makes it compatible to be delivered in a web -based format (Spence et al., 2008). In 
addition, no current version of online CBT incorporates any behavioral interventions to enhance  
engagement and adherence to the web- based treatment protocol. The underlying scientific  
query is to understand the feasibility of online delivery of CBT and assess whether web- based  
incentive tools  enhance treatment motivation  and engagement, and assists with maintenance 
Protocol  # 1803019086  
Version  Date  12/27/2022  
Page  # 10  
  
of treatment gains and relapse prevention. This study lays the groundwork for developing and 
optimizing methods for maximizing engagement, and thus, treatment efficacy, in young adults  
with anxiety.  
  
2.4 Risk/Benefit  Assessment  
 
Since this is a pilot study, and we are only trying to determine the feasibility of a  
mobile CBT program, subjects will not be using the CBT program in place of existing  
therapies. All existing therapeutic programs that subjects are part of will continue as  
normal. Thus , this study presents very minimal risk to participants. They may find the  
mobile CBT program boring or uninteresting, but since it is based in CBT theory, it will not  
make  anxiety symptoms  worse.  
 
The optional MRI scan also presents minimal risk to participants. There will be no  
contrast used. There are no known side effects of an MRI scan. Risks include the potential  
for discomfort  from  MRI scanning.  Some  people  (about one in ten) feel claustrophobic  (fear  
closed spaces). Participants will be able t o squeeze an emergency ball to communicate that 
they  want to end the scan at any time.  
 
Risks related to the EEG recording  are also minimal. Participants may complete a  
computer task during the  EEG that includes  unpleasant (death, mutilation) and erotic 
images. These images are drawn from a widely used stimulus set (The International 
Affective Picture System (IAPS)) that has been used in many prior EEG studies, including Dr. Dimitris Kiosses’s study with suicidal patients at WCM (protocol #  1603017115) as well as 
numerous  studies outside of WCM (e.g. Albanese, 2019; Schupp, 2004; Weinberg, 2010; 
Sabatinelli, 2013). Risks include possible distress related to looking at emotional pictures or 
thinking about emotional situations;  possible fatigue or boredom as a result of performing 
similar actions repeatedly; and possible mild skin irritation (redness) where the sensors contact the participant’s scalp. Skin irritation in response to EEG recording is rare and 
temporary. Participan ts are offered breaks between the tasks and can choose to 
discontinue the EEG recording at any time.  
 
In addition, the potential benefit of this study is that a mobile CBT program is  
created and is deemed feasible in this population. This is a potentially huge benefit, as mobile  CBT programs  could serve  to enhance  current CBT practices  in patients  
with an anxiety  disorder.

5.2 Treatment  Administration  
 
Treatment  will be administered  on an outpatient  basis.  
 
Participants  will be asked to engage  with  the mobile  application  at least  2 days  a week  
Protocol  # 1803019086  
Version  Date  12/27/2022  
Page  # 18  
 for 20- 25 minutes per session. These sessions can be done at the participants’  
convenience for various  lengths  of time.  These  tasks  can be boring  or frustrating  for 
Protocol  # 1803019086  
Version  Date  12/27/2022  
Page  # 19  
  
some  people,  but participants  are allowed  to take  breaks,  or to make  sessions shorter.  
Participants  may also decide  to stop  participating  at any time.  
 
5.3 General  Concomitant  Medication  and Supportive  Care  Guidelines  
 
Participants will likely be seeking therapeutic services, medication -based as well as  
psychotherapy, outside of the research context for their anxious and depressed 
symptoms.  This will be recorded  by our protocol  but will not interfere  with  their  use of 
the mobile application. We do not foresee any possible risks associated with using the  
mobile  application in addition  to external  non-CBT therapy.  
  
5.4 Duration of Therapy  and Criteria  for Removal  from  Study  
 
In the absence of treatment delays due to adverse event(s), treatment may continue for 12 weeks  or until  one of  the following  criteria applies:  
 
The study  will take  place  for a total  of 6 weeks  but participants  will continue  to have  
access  to the mobile  device  if they  would like to after the  study is  complete.  
Participants are welcome to withdraw from the study at their own discretion. There  
are no general of specific changes in the patient’s condition that would render the  
patient unacceptable  for further  treatment in the judgement of the investigator.  
 
5.5 Duration of Follow  Up 
 
Patients will be followed for 6 weeks while they are participating in the study. There  
will also be  a follow  up appointment 6 weeks  after they  finish the study.  
 
6. Dosing  Delays/Dose  Modifications  
 
Section  6 is not applicable  for this study  as we are not administering  a drug.  
 
7. Pharmaceutical  Information 
 
This is not applicable  for this study, as we are not administering  a drug.  
 
8. Correlative/Special  Studies  
 
Section 8 is not applicable for this study as there will be no correlative/special studies  
involving  specimens.  
Protocol  # 1803019086  
Version  Date  12/27/2022  
Page  # 20  
  
9. Measurement  of Effect  
 
We will be measuring the effects of the mobile CBT program using clinical measures that  
test symptoms of anxiety and depression, namely, the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression  
and the Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety. Optional fMRI scans will also be collected. The  
MRI scans will be done  without contrast.  
 
 
10. Data  Reporting  / Regulatory  Considerations  
 
10.1 Data  Collection  
 
The data collection plan for this study is to utilize REDCap to capture treatment, 
toxicity, efficacy, and adverse event data for all enrolled patients. All data collected  
from questionnaires will be kept in the “Mobile CBT” on Weill Cornell’s secure  
REDCa p system. Additional data is stored on the Weill Cornell ITS servers, Way to  
Health  Servers,  and on Heap  Analytics  Servers.  
 
10.1.1  REDCap  
 
REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture) is a free data management software  
system that is fully supported by the Weill -Cornell Medical Center CTSC.  It is a tool  
for the creation of customized, secure data management systems that include Web-  
based  data -entry  forms,  reporting  tools,  and a full array  of security  features  
including user and group based privileges, authentication using institution LDAP  
system,  with a full audit  trail of data  manipulation  and export  procedures.  REDCap  is 
maintained on CTSC -owned servers that are backed up nightly and support 
encrypted  (SSL-based)  connections.  Nationally,  the software  is developed,  
enhanced and supported through a multi -institutional consortium led by the  
Vanderbilt  University CTSA.  
 
10.1.2  Way  to Health

10.2 Regulatory  Considerations  
 
All protocol amendments and consent form modifications will be made by the  
Principal Investigator. 
  
11. Statistical  Considerations  
 
As this study is a pilot to determine feasibility of the CBT mobile application including  
non- monetary incentives, we do not anticipate high volume data. We intend to use the  
pilot data to submit an NIH grant where we will recruit a statistician to be a part of our  
research  team.  
 
11.1 Study  Design/Endpoints  
 
No subjects will be forced to end participation in the study based on a lack of 
engagement with the mobile CBT program. We will be looking at whether  participants 
completed the protocol as intended (i.e. usage statistics across the 6 weeks). We will gather  
the qualitative data from  participants when they come  for the  weekly check -in visits.  We 
will analyze how often participants opened the mobile app, completed the exercises and  
whether they completed the 6 week protocol, and if not, at what time point they stopped participating. We have no set criteria regarding what percentage must finish the protocol;  
however, if less than 25% of participants complete the protocol as intended, we will re - 
evaluate our current procedures. Such information is a critical first step before testing the  
validity of the mobile CBT platform, which will be the scope of future proposals to the NIH.  
We will a lso be comparing  differences in efficacy and treatment engagement  between three 
different incentive  conditions. We will not be comparing  the mobile  CBT to any other type  
of treatment at this initial stage.

11.2 Sample Size/Accrual  Rate  
 
We plan on recruiting 300 subjects over the course of a year, with the anticipation 
that 120 will participate in the study to completion. This means we hope to recruit  
approximately  25 subjects  per month.  
 
11.3 Stratification  Factors 
 
There  are no planned patient stratification  factors.  
 
11.4 Analysis  of Endpoints  
 
11.4.1  Analysis  of Primary  Endpoints  
 
The primary purpose of the study is to compare change in anxious symptoms from  
baseline to Visit 7 (end of treatment with the mobile cognitive behavior mobile  
applicatio n) between the three incentive conditions. The primary measure of this  
endpoint will be the Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety (HAM -A), a 14 -item questionnaire  
measure of the severity of anxiety symptoms. The items measure both psychic anxiety 
and somatic anxiety, where higher scores indicate a greater presence of symptoms and  
lower  scores  indicate  mild  to no anxiety  symptoms.  Secondary  measures of  this 
endpoint will be the Anxiety  Sensitivity  Index  (ASI)  and the Leibowitz Social Anxiety  Scale  
(LSAS). The ASI is an 18 -item scale containing three subscales measuring physical,  
cognitive, and social concerns regarding anxiety. Higher scores reflect greater self - 
reported concern and lower scores reflect little self- reported concern. The LSAS is a 24 - 
item scal e measuring fear and avoidance across social situations. Higher scores indicate  
greater fear and avoidance severity and lower scores indicate mild to no fear or 
avoidance.  
  
11.4.2  Analysis  of Secondary  Endpoints  
 
A secondary aim of the study is to compare partic ipants’ engagement with the  
mobile app between the three incentive conditions. The primary measure of this  
endpoint is the number of sessions completed over the course of treatment. Secondary  
measures are the total time spent engaging with the app during the course of treatment 
and participants’ impressions of the program as assessed by the Mobile Application  
Rating Scale (uMARS). The uMARS is a 26 -item measure of mobile application  
engagement,  functionality, aesthetics, quality  of information,  and perceived  impact.  
Higher scores indicate greater application feasibility and lower scores indicate poorer 
application  feasibility.

11.5 Interim  Analysis 
 
No planned interim analysis.  
 
11.6 Reporting  and Exclusions  
 
Not applicable  as we will not be using  a drug  or medical device.  
 
12. Adverse Event  Reporting  Requirements  
 
Adverse event (AE) monitoring and reporting is a routine part of every clinical trial.  The 
investigator will be required to provide appropriate information concerning any findings  
that suggest  significant  hazards, contraindications,  side effects,  or precautions  pertinent to 
the safe use of the drug or device under investigation.  Safety will be monitored by  
evaluation of adverse events reported by patients or observed by inv estigators or research  
staff, as well as by other investigations such as clinical laboratory tests, x -rays,  
electrocardiographs,  etc. 
 
12.1 Adverse Event  Definition  
 
An adverse  event  (also  referred  to as an adverse  experience)  can be any unfavorable  
and unintended sign (e.g., an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease  
temporally associated with the use of a drug, and does not imply any judgment 
about causality. An adverse event can arise with any use of the drug (e.g., off- label 
use, use in combination with another drug) and with any route of administration, formulation,  or dose,  including  an overdose.  
 
12.1.1  Investigational  Agent  or Device Risks  
 
Participants will be asked to engage with the mobile application at least 4 days a week 
for 20- 25 minutes per session. These sessions can be done at the participants’  
convenience for various lengths of time. The only potential risk is that the tasks can be  
boring  or frustrating  for some  people,  but participants  are allowed  to take  breaks,  or to 
make  sessions shorter.  Participants  may also decide  to stop  participating  at any time.  
 
12.1.2  Adverse  Event  Characteristics  and Related  Attributions  
Protocol  # 1803019086  
Version  Date  12/27/2022  
Page  # 24  
  
There will be no adverse events during this study as a result of the mobile CBT  
program,  as patients  will be continuing  regular anxiety  treatments.  
 
 
12.2.3  Reporting of SAE to Insert Pharmaceutical Company Name  
N/A 
12.2.4  AE/SAE  Follow  Up 
 
Please  specify  any follow  up procedures  for any AEs/SAEs  that occur  on study.  Sample  
language  is provided below  in italic s. 
 
All SAEs and AEs reported during this study will be followed until resolution or until the  
investigator  confirms  that the AE/SAE  has stabilized  and no more  follow -up is required.  
This requirement indicates that follow- up may be required for some events after the  
patient discontinues  participation  from the  study.  
 
13. Data  and Safety  Monitoring  Plan (DSMP) 
 
• We will be using REDCap, a secure web application, to manage participant  
data. Only individuals listed as co -investigators on the protocol will hav e 
access  to this  database.  
• All data that is collected by the study team will be stored in the REDCap  
database. All questionnaire data collected for the study (see attachment) will  
be stored  in the REDCap  system.  
• Participants  can discontinue  engagement  in the study  at their  own discretion.  
The only foreseeable adverse events that may cause subjects to terminate  
protocol  treatment is that they  may  get tired  or bored  of the tasks  they  asked  
to engage in  on the mobile application.  
• The researchers  will report all adverse events and unanticipated problems to  
the monitoring  board  as soon  as they  occur.  
• The monitoring entity will review data/events annually with the continuing  
review  for the study.  
• The researchers  will terminate  the protocol  if they  receive  information from  
the monitoring  board  that they  should  do so.  
• The monitoring  entity’s  comments/reviews  will be disseminated during  the 
continuing  review.  
• The study application (CBT App) environment is stored and processed on the  
Weill Cornell  ITS server  with analytics  information  sent  to Heap  Analytics,  and 
text message communications via Way to Health. Data on IP address, phone  
carrier,  and city,  as well as use of the app is collected  on these  platforms.

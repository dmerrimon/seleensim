CONFIDENTIAL Criteria for Evaluation:  
Safety:  
Safety and tolerability of CNSA -001 as measured by severity and number of treatment -emergent 
adverse events (TEAEs), including assessment of severity of TEAEs, and changes in clinical 
laboratory  and HbA1c  tests, vital signs, and physical examinations  
Efficacy:  
The primary efficacy measure will be the  change in maximal tolerated volume consumed during the 
nutrient satiety test from Day 1  to Day 14 and Day 1  to Day 28. 
Secondary efficacy measures will consist of changes in the following from baseline to  Day 14 and 
baseline to Day 28 (±1 day):  
 GCSI  (Section  6.8, Appendix 2 ) PAGI -SYM  (Section 6.9, Appendix 2 ) subscale  
(heartburn/regurgitation, fullness/early satiety, nausea/vomiting, bloating, upper abdominal 
pain, and lower abdominal pain) scores  
 Gastric emptying as measured by the GEBT  
Statistical Methods:  
The following study populations will be analyzed:  
 Safety population: all patients who were randomized and received any amount of study drug 
(CNSA -001 or placebo ) 
 Efficacy population: all patients who were randomized, received any amount of study drug 
(CNSA -001 or placebo), an d had available  Day 1 and Day 14 nutrient satiety test maximum 
tolerated volume results  
Safety will be assessed in the Safety population . Adverse events ( AEs) will be coded using the 
Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA®). The number and p ercentage of patients 
with TEAEs will be tabulated by system organ class, preferred term, and treatment group . Severity of 
AEs and serious adverse events ( SAEs ) will be summarized similarly . Those AEs leading to 
premature discontinuation from the study dru g and the serious TEAEs will be presented in a table or a 
listing. Clinical laboratory and HbA1c  test results and vital signs will be summarized at each visit as 
will changes from baseline for each treatment group.  A frequency distribution of abnormal phys ical 
examination results will be provided.  
Efficacy will be assessed in the Efficacy population. The change s from Day 1 to Day 14 and from 
Day 1 to Day 28 in maximal tolerated volume consumed during the nutrient satiety test will be 
compared between treatm ent groups using a student’s t -test. Results from the nutrient satiety test  
through Day 14 and Day 28, the GEBT through Day 15 and Day 27 or Day 29,  and the  GCSI 
(Section  6.8, Appendix 2 ) and PAGI -SYM  (Section 6.9, Appendix 2 ) through Day 14 (+1) and 
through Day 28 (±1) will be summarized using summary statistics (number of patients, mean, 
standard deviation, median, and range) at each visit as well as changes from baseline within each 
treatment group . The 95% confidence intervals for the changes from baseline  will be provided . 
Additional analyses may be conducted, and details will be provided in the statistical analysis plan .

CONFIDENTIAL 1 INTRODUCTION 
1.1 Diabetic Gastroparesis  
Gastroparesis is characterized by delayed gastric emptying in the absence of mechanical 
obstruction; symptoms are chronic with episodic symptom exacerbation ( Parkman et al,  
2004).  Gastroparesis affects women 4  times more than men (Soykan, et al, 1998 ). Idiopathic 
gastroparesis accounts for most cases, but gastroparesis is frequently associated with diabetes 
(diabetic gastroparesis) (Soykan, et al, 1998 ; Karamanolis et al, 2007 ). Several 
cross-sectional studies have found delayed gastric emptying of solids and/or liquids in 30 % 
to 50% of patients with Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes ( Horowitz et al, 2002 ). Patients with 
diabetes mellitus commonly experience gastric and intestinal dysfunction (Feldman and 
Schiller, 1983 ).  
The actual mechanism of diabetic gastroparesis is not well known. Vagal nerve dysfunction 
and/or damage, interstitial cells of Cajal loss, and smooth muscle and enteric neuron 
dysfunction have all been implicated in the pathogenesis of diabetic gastroparesis (Stacher,  
2001; Parkman et al,  2004 ). In addition, acute hyperglycemia has the potential to slow gastric 
emptying ( Camilleri et al,  2013).  
At a molecular level, attention has been devoted to the potential role of altered nitrergic 
signaling in the enteric nervous system. Gastric motility is regulated in large part by neurons 
of the enteric nervous system located in the muscle wall ( Wood et al, 1999 ). These neurons 
are either excitatory (releasing acetylcholine) or inhibitory (releasing nitric oxide [NO] and 
vasoactive intestinal peptide). Nerves throughout the luminal gastrointestinal (GI) tract 
express neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), which generates NO, a key neurotransmitter 
in the regulation of GI motility ( Takahashi, 2003 ); it is the principal nonadrenergic 
noncholinergic inhibitory neurotransmitter in the GI tract. In diabetic rats,  which serve as a 
model for type 1 diabetes, nNOS expression was found to be impaired. This impairment in 
nNOS messenger RNA expression was associated with impaired smooth muscle relaxation in 
response to electrical stimulation of circular muscle fibers obtained from the proximal 
stomach of these rats ( Takahashi et al, 1997 ). It has been demonstrated that female diabetic 
rats had slower gastric emptying than age matched diabetic male rats, female control rats had 
greater nitrergic relaxation of circular antral muscle strips compared to male controls, and 
nitrergic relaxation was impaired in diabetic female rats but not matched diabetic male rats 
(Gangula et al, 2007 ). 
The core signs and symptoms of gastroparesis by incidence are nausea (92% to 96%), 
vomiting (68% to 88%), postprandial fullness (54% to 77%), early satiety (42% to 60%), and 
upper abdominal pain (36% to 85%) ( Soykan et al, 1998 ; Hoogerwerf et al,  1999 ; Anaparthy 
et al, 2009).  Patients may experience any combination of signs and symptoms with varying 
degrees of severity. Pain is less prevalent in diabetic gastroparesis than idiopathic 
gastroparesis. Patients with diabetic gastroparesis may experience further derangement of 
glucose control because of unpredictable gastric emptying and altered absorption of orally 
administered hypoglycemic drugs, which may,  in turn,  affect measurement of core signs and 
symptoms. Severe signs and symptoms may cause complications such as malnutrition,

CONFIDENTIAL esophagitis, and Mallo ry-Weiss tears. Gastroparesis adversely affects the lives of patients 
with the disease, resulting in decreased social interaction, poor work functionality, and 
development of anxiety or depression ( Soykan et al,  1998 ; Parkman et al,  2004 ). 
1.2 Impaired Gastric Accommodation in Gastroparesis 
Patients with diabetic gastroparesis have also been shown to have gastric hypersensitivity, 
especially in the postprandial state, and impairment of the postprandial accommodation 
response. ( Kumar et al, 2008 ). The stomach functions as 2 separate regions: the fundus acts 
as a reservoir accommodating a meal without a significant increase in intragastric pressure,  
and the distal stomach/antrum triturates gastric contents. Receptive relaxation or 
accommodation is vagally mediated resulting in the release of NO and activation of nitrergic 
myenteric neurons. Nitrergic signaling is responsible for gastric accommodation and pyloric 
relaxation in response to a meal (Ishiguchi et al, 2001 ). 
Impaired accommodation has been associated with symptoms of early satiety and weight loss 
in patients with idiopathic gastroparesis (Karamanolis et al, 2007 ). A study of patients with 
diabetic gastroparesis found that 90% of patients had impaired gastric accommodation to a 
nutrient meal (Kumar et al, 2008 ). In the distal stomach, NO is required for the propulsive 
contractions that triturate gastric contents and control of pyloric closure; lack of NO can lead 
to delayed gastric emptying and impaired gastric accommodation (Gangula et al, 2007 ). 
Several co-factors are known to be important for nNOS activity, including nicotinamide 
adenine dinucleotide phosphate hydrogen (NADPH), calcium,  and tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) 
(Werner et al, 2003 ). The homodimeric conformation of all 3 isoforms of nitric oxide 
synthase ( NOS ) is regulated by BH4 (Werner et al, 2003 ). In the absence of BH4, uncoupling 
of NO production occurs and leads to super oxide production, resulting in further impaired 
nNOS bioactivity. 
1.3 Current Treatment of Diabetic Gastroparesis  
Therapies for gastroparesis have been targeted at accelerating gastric emptying or controlling 
symptoms. Available therapies for accelerating gastric emptying are limited in number and 
efficacy. These include metoclopramide (Snape et al, 1982 ), erythromycin ( Arts et al, 2005 ), 
and domperidone (not available in the United States [US]) (Prakash and Wagstaff, 1998 ). 
There is also poor correlation between gastric emptying and baseline symptom severity 
(Karamanolis et al, 2007 ; Talley et al, 2001 ) and in response to therapeutic intervention.  In 
part, as a result of lack of understanding of the underlying pathogenesis that leads to 
alterations in GI motility and sensation, medical therapies have not been targeted at the 
underlying pathophysiology of gastroparesis.   
The first-line medical therapy for patients with diabetic gastroparesis  is generally a 
combination of an antiemetic agent in addition to the promotility drug. Unfortunately, many  
patients with diabetic gastroparesis  will not experience adequate symptom relief despite 
first-line therapy. For patients with refractory disease, options include combination prokinetic 
therapy, psychotropic medications, pyloric botulinum toxin injection, and gastric electric 
stimulation  (Fass, 2010 ; Camilleri et al, 201 3).

CONFIDENTIAL 1.4 CNSA-001 (Sepiapterin) 
Sepiapterin is 2-amino-6 -[(2S)-2 -hydroxypropanoyl]-7,8-dihydro-1H-pteridin-4 -one with a 
molecular weight of 237.2 and a molecular formula of C 9H11 N5O3. 
The chemical structure of sepiapterin is: 
 
Sepiapterin serves 
as a substrate for BH4  synthesis via the pterin salvage pathway (Mayer 
and Werner, 1995 ). Oral administration of sepiapterin was shown to be more potent (>2 fold) 
than oral administration of BH4  in increasing intracellular BH4  in normal mice ( Sawabe et 
al, 2002).  Translation of this finding to humans has been confirmed in a Phase 1 study, 
PKU-001,  conducted by Censa Pharmaceuticals.   
1.5 Rationale for Study 
BH4 biosynthesis is impaired in chronic diabetes. The mechanism of impairment is not well 
understood but is thought to be a result of hyperglycemia-induced proteasome-mediated 
degradation of GTP-cyclohydrolase, the rate-limiting enzyme in the synthesis pathway for 
BH4 (Xu et al, 2007 ).  
CNSA-001 is the first viable formulation of sepiapterin, shown to increase intracellular BH4 
(Section 1.4), intended for the treatment of female patients with diabetic gastroparesis. 
CNSA-001 was studied in a single and multiple ascending-dose study in healthy volunteers, 
the Phase 1 study, Study PKU-001. Part A of t his study assessed the safety and 
pharmacokinetics of CNSA-001 at 6  dose levels inclusive of an assessment of food effect 
(i.e., 2.5 mg/kg, 7.5 mg/kg, 20 mg/kg, 40 mg/kg, 80 mg/kg,  and 10 mg/kg [to assess food 
effect]). Additionally, Kuvan® (sapropterin dihydrochloride), a synthetic BH4 commercially 
available product,  was administered at equivalent doses for the first 3  dose levels (2.5 mg/kg, 
7.5 mg/kg, and 20 mg/kg). Dose-dependent correlations between CNSA-001 and plasma 
BH4 concentr
ations were observed with each successive dose level. Dose proportionality was 
observed between the top 2  dose levels (40 mg/kg and 80 mg/kg) and resultant BH4 
concentrations. Administration with a standard high-fat (approximately 50 percent of total 
caloric content of the meal) and high calorie (approximately 800 to 1000 calories) meal 
resulted in approximately 80% higher plasma BH4 concentrations (area under the 
concentration time curve from 0 to the last measurement [AUC 0-last] and maximum 
concentration [Cmax]) than in subjects who had fasted before receipt of CNSA-001 . 
Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) in Part A of Study PKU-001 were reported in 
26 subjects (44.1%, 26/59). The TEAEs for CNSA-001 were generally mild and consistent 
with reported adverse 
events (AEs) for Kuvan® and placebo. The frequency of TEAEs did

CONFIDENTIAL not appear to increase with increasing dose. The TEAEs that were judged to be related to 
study treatment were reported in 17 subjects: 11 subjects (26.2%, 11/42) who received 
CNSA-001, 4  subjects (44.4%,  4/9) who received Kuvan®, and 2 subjects (25.0%, 2/8) who 
received placebo. No TEAEs were severe or serious or led to discontinuation of study drug. 
Headac
he and dizziness were the most common TEAEs ,  but these TEAEs occurred at a 
similar frequency as with placebo. 
Part B of Study PKU-001 assessed multiple ascending dose s CNSA-001 in healthy 
volunteers. Data indicate CNSA-001 was well tolerated following daily doses of 5, 20,  and 
60 mg/kg/day for 7 days and that TEAEs were reported in 14 subjects (58.3%, 14/24). The 
TEAEs in subjects who received CNSA 001 were mild or moderate and consistent with the 
TEAEs in subjects 
who received placebo: TEAEs were experienced by 10 subjects (55.6%, 
10/18) who rec
eived CNSA-001 at doses from 5 mg/kg to 60 mg/kg daily for 7 days and by 
4 subjects (66.7%, 4/6) who received placebo. No TEAEs were severe, serious, or led to 
discontinuation. Of the 10 TEAEs reported in subjects who received CNSA-001, only 4 were 
judged to be related to study drug, and,  of the 4 TEAEs reported in subjects who received 
placebo, only 1 was judged to be related to study drug. Somnolence, fatigue, headache, and 
proce
dural pain (secondary to performance of 2 sequential lumbar punctures 7 days apart) 
were the most common TEAEs reported, and they occurred at a similar frequency when 
compared with placebo with the exception of fatigue and headache,  which were each 
reported in 2  subjects who received CNSA-001 (11.1%, 2/18). 
This Phase 2 pilot study will assess CNSA-001  doses of 20 mg/kg/day administered as 
10 mg/kg twice a day (BID) in comparison to placebo administered BID in female patients 
with diabe
tic gastroparesis. This study will help support the design of future Phase 2/3 
studies in patients with diabetic gastroparesis.

CONFIDENTIAL 3 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN 
3.1 Overall Study Design and Plan 
Study GAS -001 is a Phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot study of 
multiple doses of CNSA-001 (sepiapterin) powder for suspension administered orally in 
women with moderate to severe diabetic gastroparesis. This is an outpatient study in which 
up to 20  patients will be enrolled at approximately 4  centers. 
The Schedule of Events is provided in Appendix 1. The study schema is displayed in Figure 
1.  
Screening Period (Day -28 Through Day 1 Predose) 
An informed consent for
m (ICF) must be signed before any study-related procedures are 
performed. After providing consent, patients will undergo Screening procedures to determine 
study eligibility, as indicated in Appendix 1. Patients who are eligible based on Screening 
evaluations will undergo baseline evaluations before initiation of study drug (CNSA-001 or 
placebo), be randomized, and proceed to the Treatment Period.  
Treatment Period (Day 1 Through Day 14) 
Following the Screenin
g Period and completion of baseline evaluations, all randomized 
patients will take their first dose of study drug (CNSA-001 or placebo) on Day 1 while in the 
clinic. Patients will undergo procedures during the Treatment Period as indicated in 
Appendix 1. 
Study drug may be prematurely discontinued for safety reasons, as described in 
Section 6.14.1 . Patients may also withdraw from the study for any reason, as described in 
Section 6.14.2 . If a patient discontinues study drug early, the patient should return to the 
study site within 24 hours of withdrawal and complete all of the procedures outlined for the 
End of Treatment (EOT) ( Section 7.5, Appendix 1). If a patient withdraws early from the 
study before undergoing EOT evaluations, the patient will be asked to return to the study site

3.2 Rationale for Study Design and Control Group 
CNSA-001 (sepiapterin) is a new chemical entity that is an endogenous, naturally occurring 
precursor of BH4 via the pterin salvage pathway. Animal studies and data from a Phase 1 
single and multi
ple ascending-dose study in healthy volunteers conducted by Censa 
Pharmaceuticals indicate rapid intracellular conversion of sepiapterin to BH4 . It is expected 
that oral administration of CNSA-001 to women with diabetic gastroparesis will result in 
increases in both intracellular and circulating BH4 concentrations. In chronic diabetes, BH4 
biosynthesis is impaired ( Xu et al, 2007 ). 
CNSA-001 was studied in two 14 -day Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) toxicity studies,  as 
described in Section 5.3, and in a single and multiple ascending-dose study in healthy 
volunteers, Study PKU-001, as described in Section 1.5.  
Because a ll patients will receive the standard of care for diabetic gastroparesis in addition to 
their assigned study drug, the study design of a randomized study of CNSA-001 versus 

CNSA-001 (sepiapterin)                                                                                                        Censa Pharmaceuticals 
Clinical Trial Protocol: GAS- 001                                                                                                                 Page 22 
FINAL 06SEP2018 
 
CONFIDENTIAL placebo in female patients with diabetic gastroparesis will not expose patient s to the risk of 
no treatm
ent.  
This study has a double-blind design intended to reduce bias. 
3.3 Study Duration and Dates 
The study duration for each patient will be up to 75  days,  extending from Screening (Day -28 
through Day -1) through the final assessments on Day 44 (± 3 days).

CONFIDENTIAL 5 STUDY TREATMENTS 
5.1 Description of Treatments 
5.1.1 Test Product 
The test product is CNSA-001 (sepiapterin) oral powder for suspension. CNSA-001 contains 
the new chemical entity, sepiapterin. Sepiapterin is 2-amino-6 -[(2S)-2 -hydroxypropanoyl]-
7,8-dihydro-1H-pteridin-4-one with a molecular weight of 237.2 and a molecular formula of 
C9H11 N5O3. Inactive ingredients in CNSA-001 include microcrystalline cellulose, colloidal 
silicon dioxide, croscarmellose, and ascorbic acid. CNSA-001 will be suspended in Medisca® 
Oral Mix prior to dispensing it to the patient.  
5.1.2 Placebo Control 
The placebo is a ready-made suspension containing microcrystalline cellulose, colloidal 
silicon dioxide, croscarmellose, ascorbic acid,  and colorant (Yellow No. 6) that is suspended 
in Medisca® Oral Mix.  
5.2 Treatments Administered 
Patients will be randomized in a ratio of 1 :1 to the following treatment groups :  
• CNSA-001 20 mg/kg/day (1 0 mg/kg BID) for 14  days 
• Placebo BID for 14 days 
Dosing of CNSA-001 is based on the patient’s weight. The weight obtained on Day -1 will 
be used to calculate the exact amount ( mg) of CNSA-001 active ingredient (sepiapterin) 
required for each patient’s daily dose.   
The placebo is  formulated as ready-made suspension. The placebo will be administered in the 
same manner (volume) as CNSA-001 . 
Details on preparation of study drug and dosing guidelines will be provided in a pharmacy 
manual for the site and an instruction guide for patients.   
5.3 Selection and Timing of Dose for Each Patient 
All patients will be randomly assigned in a ratio of 1 :1 to receive CNSA-001 20 mg/kg/day 
(10 mg/kg BID) or placebo BID.  
The CNSA
-001 dose w as selected following completion of two 14-day GLP toxicity studies 
in the rat and marmoset. The no observed adverse effect level from both studies was set at 
1000 mg/kg/day,  which represents a human equivalent dose of 161.3 mg/kg/day based on 
allometric scaling. Consequently, the proposed dose of 20 mg/kg/day represents an 8.1 -fold 
safety margin.

FINAL 06SEP2018 
 
CONFIDENTIAL Study drug will be dispensed on Day 1 (Section 6.11) with a dosing diary in which patients 
will record all doses taken and times they were taken (Section 5.8.1 ). The first dose on Day 1 
will be taken in the clinic after patient s undergo the nutrient satiety test (Section 6.7). 
If a patient vomits after taking a dose of study drug,  the patient should wait until the next 
scheduled timepoint to take another dose.  A missed dose should be taken as soon as possible, 
but >2  doses should not be taken on the same day. 
5.4 Method of Assigning Patients  to Treatment Groups 
Patients who fulfill the eligibility criteria and provide informed consent will be randomized 
in a ratio of 1:1 to the CNSA-001  or placebo group via the randomization scheme generated 
for the study.  Patients who are randomized will be considered to be enrolled.  
5.5 Blinding 
This study has a double-blind design. The Investigator, study personnel, and patient s will not 
make any effort to determine which study drug is being received. Unblinded pharmacy (or 
other qualified site) personnel will be utilized in this study to prepare the study drug. 
Patients 
will be blinded to study drug assignment. Only in an emergency, when knowledge of 
the study drug is essential for the clinical management or welfare of a specific patient, may 
the Investigator unblind a patient’s study drug assignment. Copies of the randomization 
sequence and treatment codes will be kept in the pharmacy at the sites. If emergency 
unblinding is required, the Investigator will have immediate access to individual sealed codes 
containing treatment allocations. However, before any unblinding occurs, the Investigator is 
strongly advised to discuss options with the Sponsor’s Medical Monitor or appropriate 
Sponsor study personnel. As soon as possible and without revealing the patient’s study drug 
assignment (unless important to the safety of patients remaining in the study), the 
Investigator must notify the Sponsor if the blind is broken for any reason and the Investigator 
was unable to contact the Sponsor prior to the unblinding. The Investigator will record in 
source documentation the date and reason for revealing the blinded study drug assignment 
for any p atient and  the names and roles of personnel unblinded. 
5.6 Concomitant T
herapy 
Patients will be permitted to take:  
 Analgesics, including narcotics, if the patient has been on a stable dose of the 
medication for >30 days before randomization; dose escalation is NOT permitted 
during the study through the EOT

CONFIDENTIAL 6 STUDY PROCEDURES 
6.1 Informed Consent 
Consent forms describing in detail the study drug, study procedures, and risks are given to 
the patient,  and written documentation of informed consent is required prior to conducting 
study-related procedures. See Section 10.4 for more information on the informed consent 
process. 
6.2 Medical History and Demographic Data 
A detailed medical/surgical history will be obtained at Screening. The history will include 
specific information related to any prior or existing medical conditions or surgical procedures 
involving the following systems: dermatologic; head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat (HEENT); 
lymphatic; cardiovascular; respiratory; GI; musculoskeletal; and neurological. The medical 
history will be updated on Day 1 before the start of study drug. 
Demographic data obtained at Screening will include age, gender, and self-reported 
race/ethnicity. 
6.3 Vital Signs,  Weight, and Height 
Vital signs, including blood pressure, pulse, respiratory rate, and temperature, will be 
measured at Screening, Day 1 (predose and 2  hours postdose), and at the EOT and EOS 
visits.  Vital signs will be measured prior t o collection of laboratory samples and after patients 
have rested for 5 minutes  in the supine position. For timepoints other than Day 1, vital signs 
will be taken at an
y time during the visit after resting and laboratory sample collection.   
Weight will only be collected at Screening as necessary to determine the response to 
Exclusion Criterion #5 ( Section 4.3) and on Day -1 . Height will only be collected at 
Screening. 
6.4 Physical Examination 
A complete physical examination will be performed at Screening,  on Day 1 before start of 
study drug and at the EOT and EOS visits. The examination will assess general appearance, 
as well as dermatologic, HEENT, lymphatic, cardiovascular, respiratory, GI, 
musculoskeletal, and neurological parameters.  
6.5 Clinical Laboratory Tests and Glycosylated Hemoglobin A1c 
Clinical laboratory tests will be performed by qualified local laboratories. Blood and urine 
samples for clinical chemistry, hematology,  and urinalysis will be collected at Screening,  
Day 1 (predose),  and at the EOT and EOS visits. Patients should fast overnight prior to 
collection of blood samples (minimum of 8 hours before blood sample collection ). Blood 
samples for HbA1c will be collected at Screening and at the EOT and EOS visits. Clinically 
significant laboratory abnormalities should be followed to a satisfactory resolution, as 
determined by the Investigator.

6.6 Electrocardiogram 
At Screening, 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs) will be obtained in triplicate, with 
1 minute separating the first and second recordings and 1 minute separating second and third 
recordings. The following ECG parameters will be collected and recorded in the eCRF: RR, 
PR, QRS, QT, and QTc intervals. In addition, the ECG tracing should be reported as normal,

CONFIDENTIAL abnormal clinically significant, or abnormal not clinically significant. If abnormalities are 
noted on the ECG, these should be recorded in the eCRF. 
6.7 Nutrient Satiety Test  
For the nutrient satiety test, patients consum e 120 mL of Ensure™ every 4 minutes. At 
5-minute intervals, patients score their fullness using a rating scale that combines verbal 
descriptors on a scale graded 0 to 5 (0: no symptoms, 1: first sensation of fullness [threshold], 
2: mild, 3: moderate, 4: severe and 5: maximum or unbearable fullness). Patients are told to 
stop when a score of 5 is obtained. The actual volume of Ensure™  consumed at this point is 
the maximum tolerated volume. Symptoms are measured 30 minutes after completing the test 
with patient s scoring each symptom of bloating, fullness, nausea and pain on a visual 
analogue scale with 100-mm lines and the words “unnoticeable” and “unbearable” as 
anchors. The sum of the four 100- mm visual analogue scales provides an aggregate symptom 
score (Park, 2011 ). 
The nutrient satiety test will be administered in the clinic at Screening, on Day 1 (predose),  
and on Day 14 and Day 28 after overnight fasts and after any medications that can alter GI 
sensation or accommodation or gastric emptying have been held overnight. A nutrient satiety 
test volume of ≤600 mL at Screening is required for patients to participate in this study. 
6.8 Gastroparesis Cardinal Symptom Index 
The GCSI ( Appendix 2 ) consisting of a subset of items from the PAGI-SYM instrument 
(Section 6.9, Appendix 2 ), will be administered in the clinic at Screening and on Day 1 
(predose), Day 14 (+1 day), and Day 28 (±1 day). A GCSI score >21 at Screening, indicating 
moderate to severe sy
mptoms, is required for patients to participate in this study. 
6.9 Patient Assessment of Upper Gastrointestinal Disorders-Symptom 
Severity 
The PAGI-SYM  (Appendix 2 ) is a 20-item upper GI symptom severity instrument with 
6 subscales: heartburn/regurgitation, fullness/early satiety, nausea/vomiting, bloating, upper 
abdominal pain, and lower abdominal pain. It will be administered in the clinic on Day 1 
(predose) and on Day 14 (+1 day), and Day 28 (±1 day).  
6.10 Gastric Emptying Breath Test 
The GEBT,  which is a nonradioactive noninvasive test,  will be administered in the clinic on 
Day -1 , Day 15, and Day 27 or Day 29 after the patient has fasted overnight (a minimum of 
8 hours before test administration with the exception of 4 ounces of water up to 1 hour before 
the test). At the clinic, the patient provides baseline (premeal) breath samples and then 
consumes a standardized 230 kCal meal,  consisting of a proprietary standardized 13C-labeled 
egg component (which is rehydrated and then microwaved for 1.5 minutes) and 6 saltine 
crackers
, accompanied by 6  ounces of water. The meal is to be consumed within 10 minutes. 
Single postmeal breath samples are collected in capped glass tubes at 45, 90, 120, 150, 180, 
and 240 minutes after the meal is con
sumed and sent to the specified local laboratory for 
CNSA-001 (sepiapterin)                                                                                                        Censa Pharmaceuticals

CONFIDENTIAL analysis  by Gas Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometry. By adding 13C to the test meal, the GEBT 
can determine how fast the stomach empties the meal by measuring the rate of carbon-13 
dioxide (13CO 2) excretion arising from the digested test meal. The rate of 13CO 2 excretion 
found in the patient’s breath is proportional to the patient’s rate of gastric emptying. The 
patient’s 13CO 2 excretion rate at each breath collection time is reported using the GEBT 
metric “kPCD.” The “k” is a multiplier of 1000, and “PCD” is an acronym for percent 13C 
dose excreted (as 13CO 2). The test should not be administered to patient s with a known 
allergy to egg, wheat, or algae (Spirulina) ( Cairn Diagnostics™ ; Sutton et al, 2015 ; GEBT 
package insert, 2015 ; United States Food and Drug Administration, 2015 ).  
6.11 Dispensing Study Drug  
Study drug will be dispensed on Day 1 along with a dosing diary to record all doses taken 
and times they were taken. A sufficient supply of study drug will be dispensed for dosing 
through Day 14. Details on the preparation of study drug, dosing guidelines, and storage will 
be
 provided in a pharmacy manual for the site and an instruction guide for patients.  
6.12 Adverse Events Assessments 
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of an 
intervention in humans, whether or not considered intervention-related. 
The occurrence of an AE or serious adverse event (SAE) (Section 6.12.6 ) may come to the 
attention of study personnel during study visits and interviews of a study patient presenting 
for medical care, or upon review by a study monitor. All AEs including local and systemic 
reactions not meeting the criteria for SAEs will be captured on the appropriate eCRF. 
Information to be collected includes, but is not limited to, the event description, time of 
onset, clinician’s assessment of severity, relationship to study drug (assessed only by those 
with the training and authority to make a diagnosis), and date of resolution/stabilization of 
the event. Action taken regarding study medication (e.g., drug withdrawn, interrupted ) will 
also be collected in the eCRF. All AEs that start during the study must be documented 
appropriately regardless of relationship. All treatment-related AEs or AEs leading to 
discontinuation will be followed to an adequate resolution,  as determined by the Investigator. 
Any medical condition that is present at the time that the patient is screened will be 
considered as medical history and not reported as an AE. However, if the patient’s condition 
deteriorates at any time during the study, it will be recorded as an AE. 
Changes in the severity of an AE will be documented to allow an assessment of the duration 
of the event at each level of severity to be performed. The AEs characterized as intermittent 
require documentation of onset and duration of each episode. 
6.12.1 Reporting Timelines 
The Investigator will record all reportable events with start dates occurring any time after 
informed consent and continue through clinical study completion or, in the case of 
withdrawal, until the outcome is determined. The AEs will be assessed a t each visit and/or 
CNSA-001 (sepiapterin)                                                                                                        Censa Pharmaceuticals

FINAL 06SEP2018 
 
CONFIDENTIAL through telepho ne contact with the patient. A neut ral question, such as “How have you b een 
feeling
 since your last visit?” may be asked.  
All SAEs should be reported after the patient signs the informed consent and followed until 
resolution, stabilization,  or until the In vestigator provides su fficient evidence th at no fu rther 
information can be obta ined. 
All SAEs and pregnancies (in a patient or partner of a male patient) occurring while the 
patient is on the study or within 30 (±3) days after the patient received the last dose of study 
drug must be reported within 24 hours of the knowledge of the event by study personnel 
whether or not considered to be related to study drug. 
Deaths that occur ≥30 (±3) days after the patient’s last study dose must be reported within 
24 hours of knowledge of the event, if deemed related to study drug by the Investigator. 
Although preg
nancy is not considered an AE or SAE by regulatory definition, for this study 
pregnancies must be processed following SAE timelines (e.g., within 24 hours of knowledge 
of the pregnancy) for data transmission purposes. In the event that a pregnancy complication 
occurs,  or elective termination of a pregnancy is required for medical reasons, then the 
complication will be recorded as an AE or SAE, as appropriate. 
While elective and uncomplicated induced abortion not required for medical reasons does not 
constitute an AE or SAE (even if the patient or patient’s partner is hospitalized to undergo 
abortion), spontaneous abortion is considered a fatal event and must be reported as an AE 
and SAE,  as appropriate. 
Any pregnancy and/or suspected pregnancy that occurs during the study in a female patient 
should be reported using Pregnancy Reporting Form within 24 hours of knowledge of the 
event by study personnel. Any pregnancy and/or suspected pregnancy will be followed for 
outcome. 
If the patient has received the investigational drug prior to becoming pregnant, the patien t 
will continue the efficacy assessment and Follow-up periods and measures of safety and 
efficacy will be obtained. 
The patient will be follo wed until the outcome of the pregnancy is det ermined.  It is the 
responsibility of the In vestigator to obtain and document pregn ancy info rmation on the most 
recent Pregn ancy Report Fo rm. Fur thermore, any SAE o ccurr ing as an outco me of the 
pregnan cy must be reported according to the procedures outlined for SAE reporting.

FINAL 06SEP2018 
 
CONFIDENTIAL 6.12.2 Severity 
The intensity of each AE will be graded as follows: 
Mild:  Events require minimal or no treatment and do not interfere with the patient’s 
daily activities.  
Moderate:  Events result in a low level of inconvenience or concern with the therapeutic 
measures. Moderate events may cause some interference with functioning .  
Severe:  Events interrupt a patient’s usual daily activity and may require systemic 
drug therapy or other treatment. Severe events are usually potentially 
life-threatening or incapacitating.  
 
It is important to distinguish between serious and severe AEs. Severity is a measure of 
intensity; however, an AE of severe intensity need not necessarily be considered serious. For 
example, nausea that  persists for several hours may be considered severe nausea but may not 
be considered an SAE. Alternatively, a stroke that results in only a limited degree of 
disability may be considered only a mild stroke but would be considered an SAE. 
6.12.3 Relationship 
The Investigator’s assessment of causality must be provided for all AEs (serious and 
nonserious). An Investigator’s causality assessment is the determination of whether there 
exists a reasonable possibility that the study drug caused or contributed to an AE. For 
purposes of consistency, guidelines for assessing causality are provided below: 
CNSA-001 (sepiapterin)                                                                                                        Censa Pharmaceuticals

FINAL 06SEP2018 
 
CONFIDENTIAL Not Related  The AE is completely independent of study drug administration, and/or 
evidence  exists that the event is definitely related to another etiology. There 
must be an alternative,  definitive etiolo gy documented by the cli nician.  
No relationship between the experience and the administration of study drug; 
related to other etiologies such as concomitant medications or patient’s 
clinical state.  
Unlikely  to be 
Related  A clinical event, including an abnormal laboratory test result, whose  
temporal relationship to drug administration makes a causal relationship 
improbable (e.g., the  event did not occur within a reasonable time after 
administration of the trial medication) and in  which other drugs or chemicals 
or underlying dise ase provides plausible explanations (e.g., the  patient’s 
clinical condition, other concomitant treatments).  
Possibl y 
Related  There is some evidence to suggest a causal relationship (e.g., the event 
occurred within a reasonable time after administration of  the trial 
medication). However, other factors may have contributed to the event 
(e.g.,  the patient’s clinical condition, other concomitant events). Although an 
AE may rate only as “possibly related” soon after discovery, it can be 
flagged as requiring mor e information and later be upgraded to “probably 
related” or  “definitely related,” as appropriate.  
Probabl y 
Related  There is evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and the influence of other 
factors is unlikely. The clinical event, including an abnorm al laboratory test 
result, occurs within a reasonable time after administration of the drug, is 
unlikely to be attributed to concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals, 
and follows a clinically reasonable response on withdrawal (dechallenge). 
Rechallen ge information is not required to fulfill this definition .  
Definite ly 
Related  There is clear evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and other possible 
contributing factors can be ruled out. The clinical event, including an 
abnormal laboratory test result, occurs in a plausible time relationship to drug 
administration and cannot be explained by concurrent disease or other drugs 
or chemicals. The response to withdrawal of the drug (dechallenge) should 
be clinically plausible. The event must be pharmac ologically or 
phenomenologically definitive, with use of a satisfactory rechallenge 
procedure if necessary .  
 
These criteria, in addition to good clinical judgment, should be used as a guide for 
determining the causal assessment. If the event is believed to be unrelated to study drug 
administration, then an alternative explanation should be provided,  if available.  
6.12.4 Expectedness 
An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered “unexpected” if it is not listed in the 
Investigators’ Brochure or is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed; 
CNSA-001 (sepiapterin)                                                                                                        Censa Pharmaceuticals

FINAL 06SEP2018 
 
CONFIDENTIAL or, if an Investigators’ Brochure is not required or available, is not consistent with the risk 
information described in the general investigational plan or elsewhere in the protocol. 
The drug safety medical reviewer will be responsible for determining whether an AE is 
expected or unexpected. An AE will be considered unexpected if the nature, severity, or 
frequency of the event is not consistent with the risk information previously described for the 
study agent (e.g., Investigators’ Brochure). 
6.12.5 Clinical Laboratory Adverse Events 
Laboratory abnormalities should not be recorded as AEs or SAEs unless they are associated 
with clinical signs or symptoms or require medical intervention, as determined by the 
Investigator. However, each laboratory abnormality (e.g., clinically significant changes 
detected in hematology, serum chemistry panel, urinalysis, urine microscopic, and HbA1c 
evaluations) independent from any underlying medical condition that requires medical or 
surgical intervention, or that leads to study drug interruption or discontinuation, must be 
recorded as an AE, or SAE if applicable. If the laboratory abnormality is part of a clinical 
condition or syndrome, it should be recorded as the syndrome or diagnosis rather than as the 
individual laboratory abnormality. In addition, laboratory abnormalities or other abnormal 
test assessments (e.g., vital signs) performed that are associated with signs or symptoms must 
be recorded as AEs or SAEs if they meet the definition of an AE (or SAE) as described 
below. 
6.12.6 Serious Adverse Events 
6.12.6.1 Definition 
An SAE is defined as an AE or suspected adverse reaction occurring at any dose that results 
in any of the following outcomes: death, life-threatening AE, inpatient hospitalization or 
prolongation of existing hospitalization, a persistent or significant disability/incapacity or a 
substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions, or a congenital 
anomaly/birth defect. 
An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered ‘‘life-threatening’’ if, in the view of either 
the Investigator or Sponsor, its occurrence places the patient at immediate risk of death. It 
does not include an AE or suspected adverse reaction that, had it occurred in a more severe 
form, might have caused death. 
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require 
hospitalization may be considered an SAE when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, 
they may jeopardize the patient and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 
one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such medical events include 
allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood 
dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization, or the development of 
drug dependency or drug abuse. Medical and scientific judgment  should be exercised in 
deciding whether expedited reporting is appropriate in these other situations.

FINAL 06SEP2018 
 
CONFIDENTIAL 6.12.6.2 Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction (SUSAR) 
The Sponsor must submit a safety report for any suspected adverse reaction to study 
treatment tha
t is both serious and unexpected. Before submitting a safety report, the Sponsor 
needs to ensure that the event meets all 3  of the definitions: 
 Suspected adverse reaction 
 Serious 
 Unexpected 
If the AE does not meet all 3  of the definitions, it should not be submitted as a safety report. 
6.12.6.3 Reporting Serious Adverse Events 
The Investigator will report all SAEs to the designated drug safety team within 24 hours of 
knowledge of the event whe ther or not consid ered to be related to study d rug using the SAE 
Report Form provided. 
Although not all information required for a complete SAE Report Form may be readily 
available at the time of the event, the Investigator must include sufficient information on the 
SAE Report Form to allow for a complete medical assessment. This should include at a 
minimum the patient number, site number, detailed description of the event, seriousness 
criteria, causality/relationship to study drug, and Investigator signature. 
The designated drug safety team will acknowledge the receipt of the SAE via email to the 
clinical site. After submission of the initial report, the Investigator will provide follow-up 
information to the drug safety team as requested (e.g., concomitant medications, hospital 
discharge summary) to further evaluate the event and assure that all appropriate information 
is received. Once all information is received and the SAE has been deemed appropriate for 
closure, the SAE Report Form must be signed and dated by the Investigator. 
The Inv estigator is responsible for informing the Institutional Review Board ( IRB) of the 
SAE in acco rdance with institutional policie s and pro cedures including relevant initia l and 
follow-up info rmation about the SAE. 
Treatment-related SAEs or events leading to discontinuation of study drug will be followed 
for outcome information until resolution or stabilization. Other supporting documentation of 
the event may be requested by Censa Pharmaceuticals (or designee) and should be provided 
as soon as possible. The Medical Monitor should be contacted when the Investigator 
considers an SAE to be treatment-related.

drug] will be recorded in the eCRF and reported as described in Section 6.12.6.3 . 
6.13 Prior and Concomitant Medication Assessments 
All prescription and over-the-counter medications (including herbal medications) taken by a 
patient starting from the 30-day period before Screening through Day 28 (±1 d ay) before the 
patient leaves the clinic after completion of all EOS evaluations will be recorded. Any 
concomitant medications added or discontinued during the study will be recorded at each 
visit. 
6.14 Removal of Patients  From the Trial or Study Drug 
6.14.1 Early Discontinuation From Study Drug Administration 
Premature discontinuation of study drug administration is defined as the discontinuation of 
study drug for an individual patient before the required full course of study drug is 
completed. Reasons for premature discontinuation from study drug administration should be 
recorded on the appropriate page(s) of the eCRF and may include, but are not limited to the 
following: 
 Occurrence of an  AE, SAE, or clinically significant laboratory abnormality that, in the 
opinion of the Investigator, warrants the patient’s p ermanent discontinuation from study 
drug administration 
 In the judgment of the Investigator, the patient experiences a general or specific 
change(s) that renders the patient unsuitable for continued study drug administration 
 There is a need for concomitant medication that makes the patient ineligible for further 
study drug administrati on 
 Pregnancy 
Given the requirement for pregnancy testing in women of childbearing potential at Screening 
and the requirement for highly effective methods of contraception during the study, it is 
unlikely that pregnancies will occur during study conduct. However, study drug will be 
discontinued should suspected or confirmed pregnancy or nursing during the study drug 
administration period occur. 
Patients who prematurely discontinue study drug due to any of the above reasons will 
complete the EOT assessments within 24 hours of withdrawal.

CONFIDENTIAL 6.14.2 Withdrawal From the Study  
Patients may withdraw from the study for any reason or be withdrawn at the request of the 
Investigator or Sponsor. The reason for a patient’s withdrawal must be recorded on the 
appropriate page(s) of the eCRF. Reasons for withdrawal from the study may include, but are 
not limited to: 
• Withdrawal of consent  
• AEs or SAEs  
• Significant patient noncompliance, defined as refusal or inability to adhere to the protocol 
requirements 
• The Investigator determines that it is in the best interest of the patient to withdraw from 
study participation, due to a reason other than safety 
Each patient who withdraws from the study after receipt of any amount of study drug will be 
asked to undergo EOT a
ssessments. However, patients may withdraw consent to participate 
in this study at 
any time without penalty. Withdrawn patients who receive any amount of 
study drug, will not be replaced. Withdrawn p atients who do not receive any study drug will 
be replaced. 
6.14.3 Study Stopping Criteria 
The study may be terminated if significant violations of Good Clinical Practice (GCP) that 
compromise the ability to achieve the study objectives or compromise patient safety are 
observed at any time during the study. With regard to safety, the study may be temporarily 
suspended or terminated should the Investigator, Sponsor, or IRB determine that the safety of 
patients is significantly jeopardized. The decision for a temporary or permanent study hold 
will depend on the nature, frequency, and severity of AEs that were observed in all enrolled 
patients to date. In a temporary study hold, no additional patients will be enrolled into the 
study or dosed with study drug until the study team members (including the Investigator and 
the Medical Monitor) decide it is safe to proceed with the study.  
6.15 Appropriateness of Measurements 
Safety will be measured by AEs (including SAEs), vital signs, physical examinations, and 
clinical laboratory and HbA1c tests.  
Because treatment with BH4 is hypothesized to restore nNOS function in the control of 
gastric accommodation, the nutrient satiety test ( Section 6.7) was chosen for the primary 
endpoint for this study.  Gastric accommodation has been measured using ultrasonography 
(Undeland et al,  1998 ), single-photon emission computed tomography ( Bredenoord et al, 
2003), and barostat testing ( Coulie et al, 1998 ; Sarnelli et al, 2001 ) . Barostat studies have 
been shown to be reproducible (Sarnelli et al, 2001 ) but are invasive and not widely 
available. Satiety testing using a nutrient liquid has been shown to be reproducible (Kindt et 
CNSA-001 (sepiapterin)                                                                                                        Censa Pharmaceuticals 
Clinical Trial Protocol: GAS- 001                                                                                                                 Page 42

CONFIDENTIAL al, 2008 ) and correlate with impairment in gastric accommodation but not gastric emptying 
or visceral sensitivity ( Tack et al, 2003 ). 
The GEBT is nonradioactive,  noninvasive test of gastric emptying rate that has been 
validated against the reference method of gastric scintigraphy. It has been accepted  by the 
United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in the measurement of the rate of 
gastric emptying of solids and as an aid in the diagnosis of delayed gastric emptying 
(gastroparesis) in adult humans who are symptomatic for gastroparesis. The GEBT can 
determine how fast the stomach empties a standardized meal with a 13C-labeled egg 
component by measuring the ratio of 13CO 2 to carbon-12 dioxide (12CO 2) collected in breath 
samples at multiple time points after the meal is consumed compared to baseline. The breath 
samples are collected in capped glass tubes and sent to a specified local laboratory for 
analysis. By measuring the change in the ratio of 13CO 2 to 12CO 2 over time in comparison to 
the premeal value, the rate of 13CO 2 excretion can be calculated and the gastric emptying rate 
determined. The GEBT does not require administration by specially trained health care 
professionals or special precautions related to radiation-emitting compounds (Section 6.10).  
The GCSI ( Section 6.8, Appendix 2 ), consisting of a subset of items from the PAGI-SYM 
instrumen t (Section 6.9, Appendix 2 ) (described below), is based on reviews of the medical 
literature and results from clinician interviews and patient focus groups. Its reliability and 
validity were examined in 169 gastroparesis patients from 7 clinical centers in the US. 
Patients completed the GCSI, SF-36 Health Survey, and disability day questions at baseline 
and again at 8 weeks. Clinicians independently rated the severity of the patients' symptoms, 
and both clinicians and patients rated the changes in gastroparesis-related symptoms over the 
8weeks. For the GCSI total score, the internal consistency reliability was 0.84, and the test-
re-test reliability was 0.76. Significant relationships were observed between the clinician-
assessed symptom severity and the GCSI total score, and significant associations were found 
between the GCSI scores and SF-36 physical and mental component summary scores and 
restricted activity and bed disability days. Patients with greater symptom severity, as rated by 
clinicians, reported greater symptom severity on the GCSI. The GCSI total scores were 
responsive to changes in overall gastroparesis symptoms as assessed by clinicians 
(p = 0.0002) and patients (p = 0.002) ( Revicki et al, 2003 ). 
The PAGI-SYM  (Section 6.9, Appendix 2 ) is a 20-item upper GI symptom severity 
instrument with 6 subscales: heartburn/regurgitation, fullness/early satiety, nausea/vomiting, 
bloating, upper abdominal pain, and lower abdominal pain. To develop the instrument, 
patients with GERD (n = 810), dyspepsia (n = 767), or gastroparesis (n = 169) from the US, 
France, Ge
rmany, Italy, the Netherlands, and Poland completed the PAGI-SYM, the SF-36 
Health Survey, a disease-specific health-related quality of life measure (Patient Assessment 
of Upper Gastrointes
tinal Disorders-Quality of Life [PAGI-QOL]), and disability day 
questions. Two-week reproducibility was evaluated in 277 stable patients. Construct validity 
was evaluated by correlating subscale scores with SF-36, PAGI-QOL and global symptom 
severity scores and disability days. Internal consistency reliability ranged from 0.79 to 0.91, 
and test-retest reliability ranged from 0.60 to 0.82 for the PAGI-SYM subscales. The 
PAGI-SYM subscale scores correlated significantly with SF-36 scores (all p <0.0001), 
PAGI-QOL scores (all p <0.0001), disability days (p <0.0001), and global symptom severity

CONFIDENTIAL 9 PLANNED STATISTICAL METHODS 
9.1 General Considerations 
Descriptive statistics, including numbers and percentages for categorical variables, and 
numbers, means, standard deviations, medians, minimums, and maximums for continuous 
variables will be provided. Exploratory analyses may also be performed. Listings of 
individual patient data will be produced. Additional details can be found in the statistical 
analysis plan. 
9.2 Determination of Sample Size 
The primary objective of this study is to assess the impact of CNSA-001 on gastric 
accommodation,  as measured by nutrient satiety testing ( Section 6.7), in women with 
moderate to severe diabetic gastroparesis. A total of 10 patients will be enrolled in each 
treatment group. If it is assumed  that the standard deviation for the change from baseline in 
nutrient meal volume ingested is approximately 235  mL (data on file), and using a one-sided 
t-test at the 0.025 significance level, this trial has 80% power to detect a treatment difference 
greater than 288  mL (i.e., an effect size of 1.23) in the CNSA-001group. The study also has 
90% power to detect a treatment difference greater than 330  mL (i.e., an effect size of 1.41) 
in the CNSA-001 group. 
9.3 Analysis Populations 
Two study populations will be analyzed: 
 Safety population: all patients who were randomized and received any amount of study 
drug (CNSA -001 or placebo) 
 Efficacy population: all patients who were randomized, received any amount of study 
drug (CNSA-001 or placebo), and had available Day 1 predose and Day 14 nutrient 
satiety test ( Section 6.7) maximum tolerated volume results 
9.4 Demographics,  Baseline Characteristics, Enrollment, Protocol Deviations, 
and Patient Disposition 
Enrollment, protocol deviations, demographics (age, sex, race/ethnicity), prior and 
concomitant medications, and m edical history will be summarized by treatment group using 
descriptive statistics. Discontinuations from study drug and the study will be summarized by 
treatment group as well and the reasons for discontinuation will be listed. 
9.5 Statistical Analysis of Efficacy Variables  
Efficacy will be assessed in the Efficacy population.  
The primary efficacy measure will be the changes in maximal tolerated volume consumed 
during the nutrient satiety
 test ( Section 6.7) from Day 1 to Day 14 and Day 28. The changes 
from Day 1 to Day 14 and from Day 1 to Day 28 in maximal tolerated volume consumed

FINAL 06SEP2018 
 
CONFIDENTIAL during the nutrient satiety test will be compared between treatment groups using a student’s 
t-test.  
Secondary efficacy measures will consist of changes in the following from baseline through 
Day 14 (±1  day) and through Day 28 (±1 d ay):  
 PAGI-SYM (Section 6.9, Appendix 2 ) subscale (heartburn/regurgitation, fullness/early 
satiety, nausea/vomiting, bloating, upper abdominal pain, and lower abdominal pain ) 
scores 
 Gastric emptying as measured by the GEBT (Section 6.10) 
The primary and secondary measures will be summarized by treatment group at each visit as 
well as changes from baseline using summary statistics (number of patients, mean, standard 
deviation, median, and range) including 95% confidence intervals for changes from baseline. 
Additional analyses may be conducted, and details will be provided in the statistical analysis 
plan (SAP). 
9.6 Safety Analysis 
Safety will be assessed in the Safety population. The AEs will be coded using the Medical 
Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA®). The number and percentage of patients 
with TEAEs will be tabulated by system organ class, preferred term, and treatment group. 
Severity of AEs and SAEs will be summarized similarly. Those AEs leading to premature 
discontinuation from the study drug and the serious TEAEs will be presented in a table or a 
listing. Clinical laboratory and HbA1c test results and vital signs will be summarized at each 
visit as will changes from baseline for each treatment group. A frequency distribution of 
abnormal physical examination results will be provided. Additional details will be provided 
in the SAP.

performed. After providing consent, patients will undergo Screening procedures to determine study 
eligibility , as indicated in Appendix 1 . Patients who are eligible based on Screening evaluations 
will undergo baseline evaluations before initiation of study drug ( CNSA -001 or placebo), be 
randomized,  and proceed to the Treatment  Period.   
Treatment Period ( Day 1 Through Day 14) 
Following the Screening Period and completion of baseline evaluations , all randomized patients 
will take their  first dose of study drug (CN SA-001 or placebo) on Day  1 while in the clinic. 
Patients will undergo procedures during the Treatment Period as indicated in Appendix  1. 
End of Treatment Period ( Day 14 Through Day 15 Evaluations ) 
Patients will undergo End of Treatment (EOT) evaluations on Day  14 and Day 15 as indicated in 
Appendix 1. Prelim inary efficacy will be assessed by the changes from Day 1 in the nutrient satiety 
test on Day  14. The GCSI  (Section  6.8, Appendix 2 ) and PAGI- SYM (Section 6.9 , Appendix 2 ) 
will also be administered on Day 14 (+1 day ), and the GEBT will be conducted on Day 15. 
End of Study Period ( Day 15 After Evaluations  Through Day 28 [±1 Day] Evaluations ) 
Patients will undergo End of Study evaluations on Day 28 (±1 day) as indicated in Appendix 1. 
Prelim inary efficacy will be assessed by the changes from  Day 1  in the nutrient satiety test on 
Day 28. The GCSI  (Section  6.8, Appendix 2 ) and PAGI -SYM  (Section 6.9, Appendix 2 ) will also 
be administered on Day 28 ±1 , and the GEBT will be conducted on Day 27 or Day 29.

CONFIDENTIAL  The reference product is placebo . The placebo is a ready -made suspension containing 
microcrystalline cellulose, colloidal silicon dioxide, croscarmellose, ascorbic acid, and colorant 
(Yellow No. 6) that is suspended in Medisca® Oral Mix.  
Duration of Treatment:  
Patients will be treated for a total of 14 days.  
Criteria for Evaluation:  
Safety:  
Safety and tolerability of CNSA -001 as measured by severity and number of treatment- emergent 
adverse events (TEAEs), including assessment of severity of TEAEs, and changes in clinical 
laboratory  and HbA1c  tests, vital signs, and physical examinations  
Efficacy:  
The primary efficacy measure will be the  change in maximal tolerated volume consumed during 
the nutrient satiety test from Day 1  to Day  14 and Day 1  to Day  28. 
Secondary efficacy measures will consist of changes in the following from baseline to Day  14 and 
baseline to Day 28 (± 1 day):  
• GCSI  (Section  6.8, Appendix 2) PAGI -SYM  (Section 6.9, Appendix 2 ) subscale 
(heartburn/regurgitation, fullness/early satiety, nausea/vomiting, bloating, upper abdominal 
pain, and lower abdominal pain) scores 
• Gastric emptying as measured by the GEBT  
Statistical Methods:  
The following study populations will be analyzed: 
• Safety population: all patients who were randomized and received any amount of study 
drug (CNSA-001 or placebo) 
• Efficacy population: all patients who were randomized, received any amount of study drug (CNSA -001 or placebo), and had available Day  1 and Day  14 nutrient satiety test 
maximum tolerated volume results  
Safety will be assessed in the Safety population. Adverse events ( AEs) will be coded using the 
Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA
®). The number and percentage of patients 
with TEAEs will be tabulated by system organ class, preferred term, and treatment group . Severity 
of AEs and serious adverse events ( SAEs ) will be summarized similarly . Those AEs leading to 
premature discontinuation from the study drug and the serious TEAEs will be presented in a table or a listing. Clinical laboratory and HbA1c  test results and vital signs will be summarized at each 
visit as will changes from baseline for each treatment group.  A frequency distribution of abnormal 
physical examination results will be provided. 
Efficacy will be assessed in the Efficacy population. The changes from Day 1 to Day 14 and from 
Day 1 to Day 28 in m aximal tolerated volume consumed during the nutrient satiety test will be 
compared between treatment groups using a student’s t- test. Results from the nutrient satiety test 
through Day 14 and Day 28, the GEBT through Day 15 and Day 27 or Day 29, and the GC SI 
(Section  6.8, Appendix 2) and PAGI -SYM  (Section 6.9 , Appendix 2
) through Day  14 (+1) and 
through Day  28 (± 1) will be summarized using summary statistics (number of patients, mean, 
standard deviation, median, and ra nge) at each visit as well as changes from baseline within each 
treatment group. The 95% confidence intervals for the changes from baseline  will be provided. 
Additional analyses may be conducted, and details will be provided in the statistical analysis pla n.

CONFIDENTIAL  1 INTRODUCTION 
1.1 Diabetic Gastroparesis   
Gastroparesis is characterized by delay ed gastric emptying in the absence of mechanical 
obstruction; symptoms are chronic with episodic symptom exacerbation ( Parkman et al,  
2004).  Gastroparesis affects women 4 times more than men (Soykan, et al, 1998).  Idiopathic 
gastroparesis accounts for most cases , but gastroparesis is frequently associated with diabetes 
(diabetic gastroparesis)  (Soykan, et al,  1998; Karamanolis  et al, 2007). Several 
cross -sectional studies have found delayed gastric emptying of solids and/or liquids in 30% 
to 50% of patients wi th Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes ( Horowitz et al, 2002). Patients with 
diabetes mellitus commonly experience gastric and intestinal dysfunction  (Feldman and 
Schiller, 1983).  
The actual mechanism of diabetic gastroparesis is not well known. Vagal nerve dysfunction 
and/or damage, interstitial cells of Cajal loss, and smooth muscle and enteric neuron 
dysfunction have all been implicated in the pathogenesis of diabetic gastroparesis ( Stacher , 
2001; Parkman  et al,  2004). In addition, acute hyperglycemia has the potential to slow gastric 
emptying ( Camilleri et al , 2013).  
At a molecular level,  attention has been devoted to the potential role of altered nitrergic 
signaling in the enteric nervous system. Gastric motility is regulated in large part by neurons 
of the enteric nervous system located in the muscle wall ( Wood et al, 1999). These neurons 
are either excitatory (releasing acetylcholine) or inhibitory (releasing nitric ox ide [NO] and 
vasoactive intestinal peptide). Nerves throughout the luminal gastrointestinal (GI) tract 
express neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), which generates NO, a key neurotransmitter in the regulatio n of GI motility ( Takahashi, 2003) ; it is the principal non adrenergic 
noncholinergic inhibitory neurotransmitter in the GI tract . In diabetic rats , which serve as a 
model for type 1 diabetes, nNOS expression was found to be impaired. This impairment in nNOS messenger RN A expression was associated with impaired smooth muscle relaxation in 
response to electrical stimulation of circular muscle fibers obtained from the proximal stomach of these rats ( Takahashi et al, 1997).  It has been demonstrated that female diabetic 
rats had slower gastric emptying than age matched diabetic male rats , female control rats had 
greater nitrergic relaxation of circular antral muscle strips compared to male controls , and 
nitrergic relaxation was impaired in diabetic female rats but not matched diabetic male rats  
(Gangula et al, 2007). 
The core signs and symptoms of gastroparesis by incidence are nausea (92 % to 96% ),

upper abdominal pain (36% to 85% ) (Soykan et al,  1998; Hoogerwerf  et al , 1999; Anaparthy 
et al, 2009). Patients may experience an y combination of signs and symptoms with varying 
degrees of severity. Pain is less prevalent  in diabetic gastroparesis  than  idiopathic 
gastroparesis. Patients with diabetic  gastroparesis may experience further derangement of 
glucose cont rol because of unpredictable gastric emptying and altered absorption of orally 
administered hypoglycemic drugs, which may , in turn , affect measurement of core signs and 
symptoms. Severe signs and symptoms may cause complications such as malnutrition,

with the disease, resulting in d ecreased social interaction, poor work functionality, and 
development of anxiety or depression ( Soykan et al, 1998; Parkman et al , 2004).  
1.2 Impaired Gastric Accommodation in Gastroparesis  
Patients with diabetic gastroparesis have also been shown to have gastric hypersensitivity, 
especially in the postprandial state, and impairment o f the postprandial accommodation 
response. ( Kumar et al, 2008).  The stomach functions as 2 separate regions: the fundus acts 
as a reservoir accommodating a meal without a significant increase in intragastric pressure, 
and the distal stomach/antrum triturates gastric contents. Receptive relaxation or 
accommodation is vagally mediated result ing in the release of NO and activation of nitrergic 
myenteric neurons. Nitrergic signaling is responsible for gastric accommodation and pylor ic 
relaxation in response to a meal  (Ishiguchi et al, 2001).  
Impaired accommodation has been associated with symptoms of early satiety and weight loss in patients with idiopathic gastroparesis ( Karamanolis et al, 2007). A study of patients with 
diabetic gastroparesis found that 90% of patients had impaired gastric accommodation to a nutrient meal ( Kumar et al, 2008). In the distal stomach, NO is required for the propulsive 
contractions that triturate gastric contents and control of pyloric closu re; lack of NO can lead 
to delayed gastric emptying and impaired gastric accommodation  (Gangula et al, 2007). 
Several co -factors are known to be important for nNOS activity, including nicotinamide 
adenine dinucleotide phosphate hydrogen ( NADPH) , calcium , and tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) 
(Werner et al, 2003).  The homodimeric conformation of all 3 isoforms of nitric oxide 
synthase (NOS ) is regulated by  BH4  (Werner et al, 2003). In the absence of BH4, uncoupling 
of NO production occurs and leads to super oxide production, resulting in further impaired nNOS bioactivity. 
1.3 Current Treatment of Diabetic Gastroparesis  
Therapies for gastroparesis have been targeted at accelerating gastric emptying or  controlling 
symptoms . Available therapies for accelerating gastric emptying are limited in number and 
efficacy . These include metoclopramide  (Snape et al, 1982), erythromycin ( Arts et al, 2005), 
and domperidone (not available in the U nited States  [US] ) (Prakash  and Wagstaff, 1998). 
There is also poor correlation between gastric emptying and baseline symptom severity 
(Karamanolis et al,  2007; Talley et al, 2001) and in response to therapeutic intervention. In 
part, as a result of lack of understanding of the underlying pathogenesis that leads to 
alterations in GI motility and sensation , medical therapies have not been targeted at the 
underlying pathophysiology of gastroparesis.  
The first -line medical therapy for patients with diabetic gastroparesis  is generally a 
combination of an antiemetic agent in addition to the promotility drug. Unfortunately, many 
patients with diabetic gastroparesis  will not experience adequate symptom relief despite 
first-line therapy. For patients with refractory disease, options include combination prokinetic 
therapy, psychotropic medications, pyloric botulinum toxin injection, and gastric electric 
stimulation  (Fass, 2010; Camilleri et al , 2013).

CONFIDENTIAL  1.4 CNSA-001 ( Sepiapterin ) 
Sepiapterin is 2 -amino -6-[(2S)-2-hydroxypropanoyl]-7,8-dihydro-1H-pteridin-4-one with a 
molecular weight of 237.2 and a molecular formula of C 9H11 N5O3. 
The chemical structure of sepiapterin  is: 
 
Sepiapterin serves as a substrate for BH 4 synthesis via the pterin salvage pathway ( Mayer  
and Werner , 1995 ). Oral administration of sep iapterin was shown to be more potent (>2 fold) 
than oral administration of BH4 in increasing intracellular BH 4 in normal mice  (Sawabe et 
al, 2002).  Translation of this finding to humans has been confirmed in a Phase 1 study, 
PKU-001, conducted by Censa Pharmaceuticals .  
1.5 Rationale for Study 
BH4 biosynthesis is impaired in chronic diabetes. The mechanism of impairment is not well 
understood but is thought to be a result of  hyperglycemia -induced protea some -mediated 
degradation of GTP -cyclohydrolase, the rate- limiting enzyme in the synthesis pathway for 
BH4  (Xu et al, 2007).  
CNSA-001 is  the first viable formulation of sepiapterin , shown to increase intracellular BH4 
(Section 1.4), intended for the treatment of female patients with diabetic gastroparesis . 
CNSA-001 was studied in a single and multiple ascending -dose study in healthy volunteers, 
the Phase 1 study, Stu dy PKU -001. Part A of t his study assessed the safety and 
pharmacokinetics of CNSA -001 at 6 dose levels inclusive of an assessment of food effect 
(i.e., 2.5 mg/kg, 7.5 mg/kg, 20 mg/kg, 40 mg/kg, 80 mg/kg, and 10 mg/kg [to assess food effect]). Additionally, Kuvan
® (sapropterin dihydrochloride), a synthetic BH4 commercially 
available product , was administered at equivalent doses for the first 3 dose levels (2.5 mg/kg, 
7.5 mg/kg , and 20 mg/kg). Dose- dependent correlations between CNSA -001 and plasma 
BH4 concen trations were observed with each successive dose level. Dose proportionality was 
observed between the top 2 dose levels (40 mg/kg and 80 mg/kg) and resultant BH4 concentrations. Administration with a standard high- fat (approximately 50 percent of total 
caloric content of the meal) and high calorie (approximately 800 to 1000 calories) meal 
resulted in approximately 80% higher plasma BH4 concentrations (a rea under the 
concentration time curve from 0 to the last measurement  [AUC
0-last] and  maximum 
concentration  [C max]) than in subjects who had fasted before receipt of CNSA -001. 
Treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs) in Part A of Study PKU -001 were reported in 
26 subjects  (44.1%, 26/59). The TEAEs for CNSA -001 were generally mild and consistent 
with reported adverse events (AEs) for Kuvan® and placebo. The frequency of TEAEs did

study treatment were reported in 17 subjects : 11 subjects  (26.2%, 11/42) who received  
CNSA-001, 4 subjects (44.4%, 4/9) who received Kuvan®, and 2 subjects  (25.0%, 2/8) who 
received placebo. No TEAEs were severe or serious or led to discontinuation of study drug. 
Headache and dizziness were the most common TEAEs , but these TEAEs occurred at a 
similar frequency as with placebo.  
Part B of Study PKU -001 assessed  multiple  ascending  dose s CNSA-001 in healthy 
volunteers. Data indicate CNSA -001 was well tolerated following daily doses of 5, 20, and 
60 mg/kg/day for 7 days and that TEAEs were reported in 14 subjects (58.3%, 14/24). The 
TEAEs in subjects who received CNSA 001 were mild or moderate and co nsistent with the 
TEAEs  in subjects who received placebo: T EAEs were experienced by 10 subjects  (55.6%, 
10/18) who received  CNSA -001 at doses from  5 mg/kg to 60 mg/kg daily for 7 days and by 
4 subjects (66.7%, 4/6) who received placebo. No TEAEs were severe, serious, or led to discontinuation. Of the 10 TEAEs reported in subjects who received  CNSA -001, only 4 were 
judged to be related  to study drug , and, of the 4 TEAEs reported in subjects who received  
placebo , only 1 was judged to be related to study drug. Somnolence, fatigue, headache, and 
procedural pain (secondary to performance of 2 seque ntial lumbar punctures 7 days a part) 
were the most common TEAEs reported, and they occurred at a similar frequency when 
compared with placebo with the exception of fatigue and headache, which were each reported in 2 subjects who received CNSA -001 (11.1%, 2/18). 
This Phase 2 pilot study will assess CNSA-001 doses of 20 mg/kg /day administered as 
10 mg/kg  twice a day ( BID) in comparison to placebo administered BID in female patients 
with diabetic gastroparesis . This study will help support the design of future Phase 2/3 
studies in  patients  with diabetic gastroparesis .

3.1 Overall Study Design and Plan  
Study GAS -001 is a Phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot study of 
multiple doses of CNSA-001 (sepiapterin) powder for suspension administered orally in 
women with moderate to severe diabetic gastroparesis. This is an out patient  study in which 
up to 20 patients will be enrolled at approximately  4 centers . 
The Schedule of Events is provided in Appendix 1. The study schema is displayed in Figure  
1.  
Screening Period (Day -28 Through Day  1 Predose)  
An informed consent form (ICF) must be signed before any study- related procedures are 
performed. After providing consent, patients will undergo Screening procedures to determine 
study eligibility, as indicated in Appendix 1. Pa tients who are eligible based on Screening 
evaluations will undergo baseline evaluations before initiation of study drug (CNSA-001 or placebo) , be randomized, and proceed to the Treatment Period.  
Treatment Period ( Day 1 Through Day  14) 
Following the Scree ning Period and completion of baseline evaluations , all randomized 
patients will take their  first dose of study drug (CNSA-001 or placebo) o n Day 1 while in the 
clinic.  Patients will undergo procedures during the Treatment Period as indicated in 
Appendix 1. 
Study drug may be prematurely discontinued for safety reasons, as described in 
Section  6.14.1. Patients may also withdraw  from the study for any reason, as described in 
Section  6.14.2. If a patien t discontinues study drug early, the patient should return to the 
study site within 24 hours of withdrawal and complete all of the procedures outlined for the End of Treatment (EOT) (Section 7.5, Appendix 1). If a patient  withdraws early from the 
study before undergoing EOT evaluations, the patient will be asked to return to the study site within 24 hours of withdrawal and complete all of the procedures outlined for the EOT 
(Section 7.5, Appendix 1). If a patient withdraws from the study before undergoing End of 
Study (EOS) evaluations, the patient will be asked to return to the study site within  24 hours 
of withdrawal and complete all of the procedures outlined for the EO S (Section 7.6, 
Appendix 1).   
End of Tr eatment Period (Day 14 Through Day  15 Evaluations) 
Patients will undergo EOT evaluations on Day  14 and Day  15 as indicated in Appendix 1. 
Preliminary efficacy will be assessed by the changes from Day 1  in the nutrient satiety test 
(Section 6.7) on Day  14. The GCSI ( Section 6.8, Appendix 2) and PAGI- SYM (Section 6.9, 
Appendix 2) will also be administered on Day 14 (+1 day), and the GEBT ( Section 6.10) will

3.2 Rationale for Study Design and Control Group 
CNSA-001 (sepiapterin) is a new chemical entity that is an endogenous, naturally occurring 
precursor of BH 4 via the pterin salvage pathway . Animal studies and data from a Phase 1 
single and multiple ascending -dose study in healthy volunteers conducted by Censa 
Pharmaceuticals  indicate rapid intracellular conversion of sepiapterin to BH4. It is expected 
that oral administration of CNSA -001 to women with diabetic gastroparesis will result in 
increases in both intracellular and circulating BH 4 concentrations. In chronic diabetes, BH4 
biosynthesis is impaired ( Xu et al, 2007).  
CNSA-001 was studied in two 14-day Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) toxicity studies, as described in Section 5.3, and in a single and multiple ascending -dose study in healthy 
volunteers, Study PKU-001, as described in Section 1.5.

CONFIDENTIAL  5 STUDY TREATMENTS  
5.1 Description of Treatments  
5.1.1 Test Product  
The test product is CNSA-001 (sepiapterin) oral powder for suspension. CNSA-001 contains 
the new chemical entity, sepiapterin. Sepiapterin is 2 -amino -6-[(2S)-2-hydroxypropanoyl]-
7,8-dihydro-1H- pteridin -4-one with a molecular weight of 237.2 and a molecular formula of 
C9H11 N5O3. Inactive ingredients in CNSA-001 include microcrystalline cellulose, colloidal 
silicon dioxide, croscarmellose, and ascorbic acid. CNSA-001 will be suspended in Medisca® 
Oral Mix prior to dispensing it to the patient.  
5.1.2 Placebo  Control 
The placebo is a ready -made suspension containing microcrystalline cellulose, colloidal 
silicon dioxide, croscarmellose, ascorbic acid , and colorant (Yellow No. 6) that is suspended 
in Medisca® Oral Mix.   
5.2 Treatments Administered  
Patients will be randomized in a ratio of 1:1  to the following treatment groups :  
• CNSA-001 20 mg/kg/day  (10 mg/kg BID) for 14 days 
• Placebo BID for 14 days 
Dosing of CNSA-001 is  based on the patient’s weight . The weight obtained on Day  -1 will 
be used to calculate the exact  amount ( mg) of CNSA -001 active ingredient  (sepiapterin ) 
required for each patient’s daily dose.  
The placebo  is formulated as ready -made suspension. The placebo will be administered in the 
same manner (volume) as CNSA-001. 
Details on preparation of study drug  and dosing guidelines will be provided in a pharmacy 
manual for the site and an instruction guide for patients .  
5.3 Selection and Timing of Dose for Each Patient  
All patients will be randomly assigned in a ratio of 1:1 to receive CNSA-001 20 mg/kg/day  
(10 mg/kg  BID)  or placebo BID .  
The CNSA-001 dose w as selected following completion of two 14 -day GLP  toxicity studies 
in the rat and marmoset. The no observed adverse effect level  from both studies was set at 
1000 mg/kg/day, which represents a human equivalent dose of 161.3 mg/kg/da y based on 
allometric scaling. Consequently, the proposed dose of 20 mg/kg/day represents a n 8.1-fold 
safety margin.

CONFIDENTIAL  Study drug will be dispensed on Day  1 (Section  6.11) with a dosing diary in which patient s 
will record all doses taken and times they were taken  (Section  5.8.1). The first dose on Day  1 
will be taken in the clinic  after patient s undergo the nutrient satiety test ( Section 6.7). 
If a patient vomits after taking a dose of study drug, the patient should wai t until the next 
scheduled timepoint to take another dose. A missed dose should be taken as soon as possible, 
but >2 doses should not be taken on the same day. 
5.4 Method of Assigning Patients  to Treatment Groups  
Patients who fulfill the eligibility criteria  and provide informed consent will be randomized 
in a ratio of 1:1  to the CNSA-001 or placeb o group  via the randomization scheme generated 
for the study. Patients who are randomized will be considered to be enrolled.  
5.5 Blinding  
This study has a double-blind design. The Investigator , study personnel, and patient s will not 
make any effort to determine which study drug is being received.  Unblinded pharmacy (or 
other qualified site ) personnel will be utilized in this study to prepare the study drug. 
Patients will be blinded to study drug assignment. Only in an emergency, when knowledge of 
the study drug is essential f or the clinical management or welfare of a specific patient , may 
the Investigator unblind a patient’s study drug assignment. Copies of the randomization sequence and treatment codes will  be kept in the pharmacy at the sites . If emergency 
unblinding is required, the Investigator will have immediate access to individual sealed  codes 
containing treatment allocation s. However , before any unblinding occurs, the Investigator is 
strongly advised to discuss options with the Sponsor’s Medical Monitor or appropriate 
Sponsor study personnel. As soon as possible and without revealing the patient ’s study drug 
assignment (unless important to the safety of patients remaining in the study), the Investigator must notify the Sponsor if the blind is broken for any reason and t he Investigator 
was unable to contact the Sponsor prior to the unblinding. The Investigator will record in source documentation the date and reason for revealing the blinded study drug assignment for any patient  and the names  and roles of personnel unblinded . 
5.6 Concomitant Therapy  
Patients will be permitted to take:  
• Analgesics, including narcotics, if the patient has been on a stable dose of the medication for > 30 days before  randomization; dose escalation is NOT permitted 
during the study through the EOT

6.7 Nutrient Satiety Test  
For t he nutrient satiety test, patients  consum e 120 mL of Ensure ™ every 4 minutes. At 
5-minute intervals, patien ts score their fullness using a rating scale that combines verbal 
descriptors on a scale graded 0  to 5 (0: no symptoms, 1: first sensation of fullness [threshold], 
2: mild, 3: moderate, 4: severe and 5: maximum or unbearable fullness). Patients are  told to 
stop when a score of 5 is obtained. The actual volume of Ensure™ consumed at this point is 
the maximum tolerated volume. Symptoms are measured 30 minutes after comple ting the test 
with pat ients scoring each symptom of bloating, fullness, nausea and pain on a visual 
analogue scal e with 100- mm lines and the words “unnoticeable” and “unbearable” as 
anch ors. The sum of the four 100- mm visual analogue scales provides an aggregate symptom 
score ( Park, 2011). 
The nutrient satiety test will be administered in the clinic at Screening, on Day 1 (predose), 
and on Day  14 and Day 28 after overnight fasts and after any medications that  can alter GI 
sensation  or accommodation or gastric emptying have been held overnight. A nutrient satiety 
test volume of ≤600 mL at Screening is required for patients to participate in this study. 
6.8 Gastroparesis Cardinal Symptom Index  
The GCSI  (Appendix 2) consisting of a subset of items from the PAGI- SYM  instrument 
(Section 6.9, Appendix 2) , will be administered in the clinic at Screening  and on Day  1 
(predose), Day  14 (+1 day) , and Day  28 (±1 day) . A GCSI score >21  at Screening , indicating 
moderate to severe symptoms, is required for patient s to participate in this study.  
6.9 Patient Assessment of Upper Gastrointestinal Disorders -Symptom 
Severity  
The PAGI -SYM  (Appe ndix 2 ) is a 20-item upper GI  symptom severity instrument with 
6 subscales: heartburn/regurgitation, fullness/early satiety, nausea/vomiting, bloating, upper 
abdominal pain, and lower abdominal pain. It will be administered in the clinic on Day  1 
(predose) and on Day  14 (+1 day) , and Day 28 (± 1 day).  
6.10 Gastric Emptying Breath Test  
The GEBT, which is a nonradioactive noninvasive test, will be administered in the clinic on 
Day -1, Day  15, and Day 27 or Day  29 after the patient has fasted overnight  (a minimum of 
8 hours before test administration  with the exception of 4 ounces of water up to 1 hour before 
the test ). At the clinic , the patie nt provides baseline (premeal) breath samples and then 
consumes a standardized 230 kCal meal, consisting of a propr ietary standardized 13C-labeled 
egg component (which is rehydrated and then microwaved for 1.5 minutes) and 6 saltine 
crackers , accompanied by 6 ounces of water. The  meal is to be consumed within 10 minutes.

dioxide (13CO 2) excretion arising from the digested test meal. The rate of 13CO 2 excretion 
found in the patient’s breath is proportional to the patient’s rate of gastric emptying. The 
patient’s 13CO 2 excretion rate at each breath collection time is reported using the GEBT 
metric “kPCD.” The “k” is a multiplier of 1000, and “PCD” is an acronym for percent 13C 
dose excreted (as 13CO 2). The test should not be administered to patient s with a known 
allergy to egg, wheat, or algae ( Spirulina) ( Cairn Diagnostics ™; Sutton et al , 2015; GEBT  
package insert, 2015; United States Food and Drug Administration, 2015).  
6.11 Dispensing Study Drug   
Study drug will be dispensed on Day  1 along with a dosing diary to record all doses taken 
and times they were taken.  A sufficient supply of study drug will be dispensed for dosing 
through Day  14. Details on the preparation of study drug , dosing guidelines , and storage will 
be provided in a pharmacy manual for the site and an instruction guide for patients . 
6.12 Adverse Events Assessments  
An AE  is defined as any untoward medical occurrence associated wit h the use of an 
intervention in humans, whether or not considered intervention- related.  
The occurrence of an AE or serious adverse event ( SAE ) (Section 6.12.6) may come to the 
attention of study personnel during study visits and interviews of a study patient presenting 
for medical care, or upon review by a study monitor. All AEs including local and systemic reactions not meeting the criteria for SAEs will be captured on the appropriate e CRF. 
Information to be collected includes, but is  not limited to, the  event description, time of 
onset, clinician’s assessment of severity, relationship to study dru g (assessed only by those 
with the training and authority to make a diagnosis), and date of resolution/stabilization of 
the event. Action taken regarding study medication (e.g., drug withdrawn, interrupted) will 
also be collected in the eCRF. All AEs that start during the study must be documented 
appropriately regardless of relationship. All treatment -related AEs or AEs leading to 
discontinuation will be followed to an adequate resolution, as determined by the Investigator. 
Any medical condition that is pre sent at the time that the patient is screened  will be 
considered as medical history  and not reported as an AE. However, if the patient’s condition 
deteriorates at any time during the study, it will be recorded as an AE.  
Changes in the severity of an AE will be documented to allow an assessment of the duration of the event at each level of severity to be performed. The AEs characterized as intermittent 
require documentation of onset and duration of each episode. 
6.12.1 Reporting Timelines  
The Investigator will record all reportable events  with start dates occurring any time after 
informed consent and continue through clinical study completion or, in the case of 
withdrawal, until the outcome is determined. The AEs will be  assessed a t each v isit and/or

information can be obta ined. 
All SAEs and pregnancies (in a patient or partner of a male patient) occurring while the 
patient is on the study or within 30 (± 3) days after the patient received the last dose of study 
drug must be reported within 24 hours of the knowledge of the event by study personnel 
whether or not considered to be related to study drug. 
Death s that occur ≥30 (± 3) days after the patient’s last st udy dose must be reported within 
24 hours of knowledge of the event, if deemed related to study drug by the Investigator.  
Although pregnancy is not considered an AE or SAE by regulatory definition, for this study 
pregnancies must be processed following SAE  timelines (e.g., within 24 hours of knowledge 
of the pregnancy) for data transmission purposes. In the event that a pregnancy complication 
occurs , or elective termination of a pregnancy is required for medical reasons, then the 
complication will be record ed as an AE or SAE , as appropriate.  
While elective and uncomplicated induced abortion not required for medical reasons does not constitute an AE  or SAE (even if the patient  or patient’ s partner is hospitalized to undergo 
abortion), spontaneous abortion is considered a fatal event and must be reported as an AE 
and SAE, as appropriate.  
Any pregnancy and/or suspected pregnancy that occurs during the study in a female patient should be reported using Pregnancy Reporting Form within 24 hours of knowledge of the event by study personnel. Any pregnancy and/or suspected pregnancy will be followed for outcome. 
If the patient has received the investigational drug prior to becoming pregnant, the patien t 
will continue the efficacy assessment and Follow-up periods and measures of safety and 
efficacy will be obtained.  
The patient will be  followed until the outcome of the pregnancy is determined. I t is the 
responsibility of the Inve stigator to obtain and document pregnancy information on the most 
recent Pregnancy Report Form. Fur thermore, any S AE o ccurrin g as an outco me of the 
pregnancy must be re ported according to the procedures outlined for SAE reporting.

CONFIDENTIAL  6.12.2 Severity  
The intensity of each AE will be graded as follows:  
Mild:  Events require minimal or no treatment and do not interfere with the 
patient’s daily activities.  
Moderate:  Events result in a low level of inconvenience or concern with the therapeutic 
measures. Moderate events may cause some interference with functioning .  
Severe:  Events interrupt a patient’s usual daily activity and may require systemic 
drug therapy or other treatment. Severe events are usually potentially 
life-threatening or incapacitating.  
 
It is important to distinguish between serious and severe AEs. Severity is a measure of 
intensity; however, an AE of severe intensity need not necessarily be considered serious. For 
example, nausea that  persists for several hours may be considered severe nausea but may not 
be considered an SAE. Alternatively, a stroke that  results in only a limited degree of 
disability may be considered only a mild stroke but would be considered an SAE. 
6.12.3 Relationship  
The Investigator’s assessment of causality must be provided for all AEs (serious and 
nonserious). An Investigator’s causality assessment is the determination of whether there exists a reasonable possibility that the study drug caused or contributed to an AE. For purposes of consistency, guidelines for assessing c ausality are provided  below: 
CNSA -001 (sepiapterin)                                                                                                        Censa Pharmaceuticals

AMENDMENT 1: 09 Oct 2018 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Not Related  The AE is completely independent of study drug administration, and/or 
evidence exists that the event is definitely related to another etiology. There 
must be an alternative,  definitive etiolo gy documented by the cli nician.  
No relationship between the experience and the administration of study 
drug; related to other etiologies such as concomitant medications or 
patient’s clinical state.  
Unlikely  to be 
Related  A clinical event, including an abnormal laboratory test result, whose  
temporal relationship to drug administration makes a causal relationship improbable (e.g., the event did not occur within a reasonable time after administration of the trial medication) and in  
which other drugs or chemicals 
or underlying disease provides plausible explanations (e.g., the patient’s 
clinical condition, other concomitant treatments).  
Possibl y 
Related  There is some evidence to suggest a causal relationship (e.g., the event 
occurred within a reasonable time after administration of  the trial 
medication). However, other factors may have contributed to the event (e.g.,  the patient’s clinical condition, other concomitant events). Although 
an AE may rate only as “possibly related” soon after discovery, it can be flagged as requiring more information and later be upgraded to “probably 
related” or  “definitely related,” as appropriate.  
Probabl y 
Related  There is evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and the influence of other 
factors is unlikely. The clinical event, including an abnorm al laboratory test 
result, occurs within a reasonable time after administration of the drug, is unlikely to be attributed to concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals, and follows a clinically reasonable response on withdrawal (dechallenge). 
Rechallen ge information is not required to fulfill this definition .  
Definite ly 
Related  There is clear evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and other possible 
contributing factors can be ruled out. The clinical event, including an abnormal laboratory test result, occurs in a plausible time relationship to drug administration and cannot be explained by concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals. The response to withdrawal of the drug (dechallenge) should be clinically plausible. The event must be pharmac ologically or 
phenomenologically definitive, with use of a satisfactory rechallenge 
procedure if necessary .  
 
These criteria, in addition to good clinical judgment, should be used as a guide for 
determining the causal assessment. If the event is believed to be unrelated to study drug 
administration, then an alternative explanation should be provided, if available . 
6.12.4 Expectedness  
An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered “ unexpected ” if it is not listed in the 
Investigators’ Brochure or is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed;

AMENDMENT 1: 09 Oct 2018 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  or, if an Investigators’ Brochure is not required or available, is not consistent with the risk 
information described in the general investigational plan or elsewhere in the protocol. 
The drug safety medical reviewer will be responsible for determining whether an AE is 
expected or unexpected. An AE will be considered unexpected if the nature, severity, or frequency of the event is not consistent with the risk information previously described for the study agent ( e.g., Investigators’ Brochure). 
6.12.5 Clinical Laboratory Adverse Events  
Laboratory abnormalities should not be recorded as AEs or SAEs unless they are associated with clinical signs or symptoms or require medical intervention, as determined by the 
Investigator. However, each laboratory abnormality ( e.g., clinically significant changes 
detected in hematology, serum chemistry panel , urinalysis, urine microscopic, and HbA1c  
evaluations) independent from any underlying medical condition that requires medical or surgical intervention, or that leads to study drug interruption or discontinuation, must be recorded as an AE, or SAE if applicable. If the laboratory abnormality is part of a clini cal 
condition or syndrome, it should be recorded as the syndrome or diagnosis rather than as the individual laboratory abnormality. In addition, laboratory abnormalities or other abnormal test assessments ( e.g., vital signs ) performed that are associated w ith signs or symptoms must 
be recorded as AEs or SAEs if they meet the definition of an AE (or SAE) as described below. 
6.12.6 Serious Adverse Events  
6.12.6.1 Definition  
An SAE is defined as an AE or suspected adverse reaction  occurring at any dose that results 
in any of the following outcomes: death, life -threatening AE, inpatient  hospitalization or 
prolongation of existing hospitalization, a persistent or significant disability/incapacity or a 
substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect. 
An AE  or suspected adverse reaction is considered ‘‘life- threatening’’ if, in the view of either 
the Investigator or Sponsor, its occurrence places the patient at immediate risk of death. It 
does not include an AE  or suspected adverse reaction that, had it occurred in a more severe 
form, might have caused death. 
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospitalization may be considered an SAE when, based upon appropriat e medical judgment, 
they may jeopardize the patient and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 
one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such medical events include 
allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an  emergency room or at home, blood 
dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. Medical and scientific judg ment  should be exercised in 
deciding whether expedited reporting is appropriate in these other situations.

AMENDMENT 1: 09 Oct 2018 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  6.12.6.2 Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction (SUSAR)  
The Sponsor must submit a safety report for any suspected adverse reaction to study 
treatment that is both serious and unexpected. Before submitting a safety report, the Sponsor 
needs to ensure that the event meets all 3 of the definitions: 
• Suspected adverse reaction  
• Serious 
• Unexpected  
If the AE does not meet all 3 of the definitions, it should not be submitted as a safety report. 
6.12.6.3 Reporting Serious Adverse Events 
The Investigator will report all SAEs to the designated drug safety team within 24 hours of 
knowledge of the event whe ther or not consider ed to be re lated to study drug using the SAE 
Report Form provided. 
Although not all information required for a complete SAE Report Form may be readily 
available at the time of the event, the Investigator must include sufficient information on the SAE Report Form to allow for a complete medical assessment. This should incl ude at a 
minimum the patient number, site number, detailed description of the event, seriousness 
criteria, causality/relationship to study drug , and I nvestigator signature . 
The designated drug safety team will acknowledge the receipt of the SAE via email to the 
clinical site. After submission of the initial report, the Investigator will provide follow -up 
information to the drug safety team as requested (e.g., concomitant medications, hospital 
discharge summary) to further evaluate the event and assure that all appropriate information 
is received. Once all information is received and the SAE has been deemed appropriate for closure, the SAE Report Form must be signed and dated by the Investigator. 
The Inve stigator is responsible for in forming  the Institutional Review Board ( IRB) of the 
SAE in accordance with institution al policie s and procedure s including re levant initia l and 
follow-up information about the S AE. 
Treatment -related SAEs or events leading to discontinuation of study drug will be followed 
for outcome information until resolution or stabilization. Other supporting documentation of 
the event may be requested by Censa Pharmaceuticals (or designee) and should be provided 
as soon as possible. The Medical Monitor should be contacted when the Investigator considers an SAE to be treatment -related.  
6.12.7 Treatment -Emergent Adverse Events  
Those AEs that start at the time of or after the first dose of study drug  are TEAEs . Those AEs 
that worsen at or after the time of first dose of study dru g are also considered 
treatment -emergent. All AEs that occur on or after the ICF has been signed, including all 
TEAE s, through Day  29 will be recorded in the eCRF.

CONFIDENTIAL  All SAEs through Day 44 ±3 days [30 ±3 days after the patient received last dose of study 
drug] will be recorded in the eCRF and reported as described in Section 6.12.6.3. 
6.13 Prior and Concomitant Medication Assessments  
All prescription and over-the-counter medications (including herbal medications) taken by a 
patient starting from the 30 -day period before Screening through Day  28 (±1 day ) before the 
patient leaves the clinic after completion of all EOS evaluations will b e recorded. Any 
concomitant medications added or discontinued during the study will be recorded at each visit.  
6.14 Removal of Patients  From the Trial or Study Drug  
6.14.1 Early Discontinuation From Study Drug Administration  
Premature discontinuation of study drug administration is defined as the discontinuation of study drug for an individual patient before the required full course of study drug is 
completed.  Reasons for premature discontinuation from study drug administration should be 
recorded on the appropriate page(s) of the eCRF and may include, but are not limited to the following: 
• Occurrence of an AE, SAE,  or clinically significant laboratory abnormality that, in the 
opinion of the Investigator, warrants the patient’s permanent discontinuation from study 
drug administration  
• In the judgment of the Investigator, the patient experiences a general or specific 
change(s) that renders the patient unsuitable for continued study drug administr ation  
• There is a need for concomitant medication that makes the patient ineligible for further 
study drug administration  
• Pregnancy  
• Specific reasons related  to adverse events that have been observed in pre- and post-
marketing treatment with the same drug class of  CNSA-001 (i.e., sapropterin): 
o Hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis  
o Gastritis  
o Abnormal liver function tests in patients with liver impairment  
o Unexplained hyperactivity  
Given the requirement for pregnancy testing in women of childbearing pote ntial at Screening 
and the requirement for highly effective methods of contraception during the study, it is 
unlikely that pregnancies will occur during study conduct. However, study drug will be 
discontinued should suspected or confirmed pregnancy or nurs ing during the  study drug 
administration period occur.

AMENDMENT 1: 09 Oct 2018 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Patients who prematurely discontinue study drug due to any of the above reasons will 
complete the EOT  assessments  within  24 hours of withdrawal.  
6.14.2 Withdrawal F rom the Study  
Patients may withdraw from the study for any reason or be withdrawn at the request of the 
Investigator or Sponsor. The reason for a patient ’s withdrawal must be recorded on the 
appropriate page(s) of the eCRF. Reasons for withdrawal from the study may include, but are 
not limited to:  
• Withdrawal of consent  
• AEs or SAEs  
• Significant patient  noncompliance, defined as refusal or inability to adhere to the protocol 
requirements  
• The Investigator determines that it is in the best interest of the patient to withdraw from 
study participation, due to a reason other than safety 
Each patient who withdraws from the study after receipt of any amount of study drug will be 
asked to undergo EOT  assessments. However, patients may withdraw consent to participate 
in this study at any time without penalty. Withdrawn patients  who receive any amount  of 
study drug, will not be replaced.  Withdrawn patients who do not receive any study drug will 
be replaced.  
6.14.3 Study Stopping Criteria  
The study may be terminated if significant violations of Good C linical Practice ( GCP ) that 
compromise the ability to achieve the study objectives or compromise patient  safety are 
observed at any time during the study. With regard to safety, the study may be temporarily suspended or terminated should the Investigator, Sponsor, or IRB determine that the safety of 
patients  is significantly jeopardized. The decision for a temporary or permanent study hold 
will depend on the nature, frequency, and severity of AEs that were observed in all enrolled patients to date. For example, the study will be temporarily  or permanently halted should 
either of the following occur: 
• The presence of the same system organ class (e,g., gastrointestinal, cardiac, etc. ) 
severe AE for which no other alternative etiology can be identified, considered related to study drug, in 2 or more patients (Severity defined in Section 6.12.2). 
• The presence of life- threatening AE  or AE requiring urgent intervention in 1 or more 
patients . 
• Death related to Adverse Event.

CONFIDENTIAL  In a temporary study hold, no additional patients will be enrolled into the study or dosed with 
study drug until the study team members (including the Investigator and the Medical 
Monitor) decide it is safe to proceed with the study. 
  6.15 Appropriateness of Measurements  
Safety will be measured by AEs (including SAEs), vital signs, physical examinations, and 
clinic al laboratory and HbA1c tests .  
Because treatment with BH4 is hypothesized to restore nNOS function in the control of 
gastric accommodation, the nutrient satiety test (Section 6.7) was chosen for the primary 
endpoint for this study. Gastric accommodation has been measured using ultrasonography 
(Undeland et al , 1998), single-photon emission computed tomography ( Bredenoord et al, 
2003), and barostat testing ( Coulie et al, 1998; Sarnelli et al, 2001).  Barostat studies have 
been shown to be reproducible ( Sarnelli et al, 2001 ) but are invasive and not widely 
available. Satiety testing using a nutrient liquid has been shown to be reproducible ( Kindt et 
al, 2008) and correlate with impairment in gastric accommodation but not gastric emptying 
or visceral sensitivity  (Tack et al, 2003).  
The GEBT is nonradioactive, noninvasive test of gastric emptying rate that has been 
validated against the reference method of gastric scintigraphy . It has been accepted by the 
United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in the measurement of the rate of gastric emptying of solids and as an aid in the diagnosis of delayed gastric emptying (gastroparesis) in adult humans who are symptomatic for gastroparesis. The GEBT can determine how fast the stomach empties a standardized  meal with a 
13C-labeled egg 
component by measuring the ratio of 13CO 2 to carbon -12 dioxide (12CO 2) collected in breath 
samples at multiple time points after the meal is consumed compared to baseline. The breath 
samples are collected in capped glass tubes and sent to a specified local laboratory for 
analysis. By measuring the change in the ratio of 13CO 2 to 12CO 2 over time in comparison to 
the premeal value, the rate of 13CO 2 excretion can be calculated and the gastric emptying rate 
determined. The GEBT does not require administration by specially trained health care professionals or special precautions r elated to radiation -emitting compounds ( Section 6.10).  
The GCSI  (Section  6.8, Appendix 2), consisting of a subset of items from the PAGI- SYM 
instrument (Section 6.9, Appendix 2) (described below), is based on reviews of the medical 
literature and results from clinician interviews and patient focus groups. Its reliability and validity were examined in 169 gastroparesis patients from 7  clinical centers in the US. 
Patients completed the GCSI, SF -36 Health Survey, and disability day questions at baseline 
and again at 8 weeks. Clinicians independently rated the severity of the patients' symptoms, and both clini cians and patients rated the changes in gastroparesis -related symptoms over the 
8weeks. For the GCSI total score, the internal consistency reliability was 0.84, and the test-re-test reliability was 0.76. Significant relationships were observed between the clinician -
assessed symptom severity and the GCSI total score, and significant associations were found between the GCSI scores and SF -36 physical and mental component summary scores and 
restricted activity and bed disability days. Patients with greater symp tom severity, as rated by 
CNSA -001 (sepiapterin)                                                                                                        Censa Pharmaceuticals

The PAGI -SYM  (Section 6.9, Appendix 2) is a 20-item upper GI  symptom severity 
instrument with 6  subscales: heartburn/regurgitation, fullness/early satiety, nausea/vomiting, 
bloating, upper abdominal pain, and lower abdominal pain. To develop the instrument, patients with GERD (n  = 810), dyspepsia (n = 767), or g astroparesis (n  = 169) from the US, 
France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, and Poland completed the PAGI-SYM, the SF-36 Health Su rvey, a disease- specific health -related quality of life  measure ( Patient Assessment 
of Upper Gastrointes tinal Disorders -Quality of Life [PAGI -QOL]), and disability day 
questions. Two-week reproducibility was evaluated in 277 stable patients. Construct vali dity 
was evaluated by correlating subscale scores with SF -36, PAGI-QOL and global symptom 
severity scores and disability days. Internal consistency reliability ranged from 0.79 to 0.91, and test -retest reliability ranged from 0.60 to 0.82 for the PAGI- SYM subscales. The 
PAGI -SYM subscale scores correlated significantly with SF -36 scores (all p <0.0001), 
PAGI -QOL scores (all p <0.0001), disability days (p <0.0001), and global symptom severity 
(p <0.0001). Mean PAGI-SYM scores varied significantly in groups defined by disability days (all p <0.0001), in which greater symptom severity was associated with more disability days ( Rentz et al, 2004; Revicki et al, 2004).

CONFIDENTIAL  9 PLANNED STATISTICAL METHODS  
9.1 General Considerations  
Descriptive statistics, including numbers and percentages for categorical variables, and 
numbers, means, standard deviations, medians, minimums, and maximums for continuous variables will be provided. Exploratory analyses may also be performed. Listings of individual patient data will be produced. Additional details can be found in the statistical 
analysis plan . 
9.2 Determination of Sample Size 
The primary objective of this study is to assess the impact of CNSA -001 on gastric 
accommodation , as measured by nutrient satiety testing (Section 6.7), in women with 
moderate to severe diabetic gastroparesis . A total of 10 patients will be enr olled in each 
treatment group. If it is assume d that the standard deviation for the change from baseline in 
nutrient meal volume ingested is approximately 2 35 mL ( data on file ), and using a one-sided 
t-test at the 0.025 significance level, this trial has 80% power to detect a treatment difference greater than 288 mL (i.e., an effect size of 1.23) in the CNSA-001group. The study also has 
90% power to detect a treatment difference greater than 330 mL (i.e., an effect size of 1.41) 
in the CNSA-001 group. 
9.3 Analysis Populations 
Two study populations will be analyzed: 
• Safety population: all patients who were randomized and received any amount of study 
drug (CNSA -001 or placebo) 
• Efficacy population: all patients who were randomized, received any amount of study 
drug (CNSA -001 or placebo), and had available Day 1 predose and Day  14 nutrient 
satiety test (Section 6.7) maximum tolerated volume results  
9.4 Demographics, Baseline Characteristics , Enrollment, Protocol Deviations, 
and Patient Disposition  
Enrollment, protocol deviations, demographics (age, sex , race/ethnicity ), prior and 
concomitant me dications, and m edical history  will be summarized by treatment group using 
descriptive statistics. Discontinuations from study drug and the study will be summarized by 
treatment group as well  and the reasons for discontinuation will be listed. 
9.5 Statistical Analysis of Efficacy  Variables  
Efficacy will be assessed in the Efficacy population.  
The primary  efficacy measure will be the changes in maximal tolerated volume consumed 
during the nutrient satiety test (Section 6.7) from Day 1  to Day  14 and Day  28. The changes 
from Day 1 to Day 14 and from Day 1 to Day 28 in maximal tolerated volume consumed

CONFIDENTIAL  during the nutrient satiety test will be compared between trea tment groups using a student’s 
t-test.  
Secondary efficacy measures will consist of changes in the following from baseline through 
Day 14 (±1 day) and through Day 28 (±1 day ):  
• PAGI -SYM (Section 6.9, Appendix 2) subscale (heartburn/regurgitation, fullness/early 
satiety, nausea/vomiting, bloating, upper abdominal pain, and lower abdominal pain) scores  
• Gastric emptying as measured by the GEBT  (Section 6.10) 
The primary and secondary measures will be summarized by treatment group at each visit as well as changes from baseline using summary statistics (number of patients, mean, standard 
deviation, median, and range) including 95% confidence intervals for changes from baseline. Additional analyses may be conducted, and details will be provided in the statistical analysis plan (SAP).  
9.6 Safety Analysis 
Safety will be assessed in the Safety population. The AEs  will be coded using the Medical 
Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA
®). The number and perc entage of patients 
with TEAEs  will be tabulated by system organ class, preferred term, and treatment group. 
Severity of AEs and SAEs  will be summarized similarly. Those AEs leading to premature 
discontinuation from the study drug and the serious TEAEs will be presented in a table or a listing. Clinical laboratory and HbA1c  test results and vital signs will be summarized at each 
visit as will changes from baseline for each treatment group.  A frequency distribution of 
abnormal physical examination results will be provided. Additional detail s will be provided 
in the SAP.

participate. Study patients will be asked to carefully  review the ICF approved by Censa 
Pharmaceuticals  (or designee) and the IRB. After any needed discussion and consideration of 
study participation and before undergoing any procedures specifically for the study, the patient will sign the ICF. The ICF will be retained in the study patient’s study records, and a 
copy of the ICF will be given to the study patient . 
Patients  may decline to participate in the study and withdraw consent at any time or for any 
reason throughout the course of the study without AEs  on the quality of their medical care.  
10.5 Confidentiality  
The Investigator must assure that patients’ anonymity is strictly maintained and that their 
identities are protected from unauthorized parties. This extends to testing of biological samples and genetic tests in addition to the clinical information relating to participants. Only an identification code (i.e., not names) should be recorded on any form or document submitted to Censa Pharmaceuticals , the Contract Research Organi zation ( CRO ), or the IRB. 
The Investigator must keep logs on screened and enrolled patients . In addition, the 
Investigator must have a list where the identity of all treated patients can be found. 
The Investigator agrees that all information received from Censa Pharmaceuticals, including, 
but not limited to, the Investigator’s Brochure, this protocol, CRFs, and any other 
information related to the protocol- specified treatment of the study, remain the sole and 
exclusive property of Censa Pharmaceuticals  during the conduct of the study and thereafter. 
This information is not to be disclosed to any third party (except employees or agents directly involved in the conduct of the study or as required by law) without prior written consent from Censa Pharmaceuticals . The Investigator further agrees to take all reasonable precautions to 
prevent the disclosure by any employee or agent of the study center to any third party or otherwise into the public domain. 
The study monitor, other authorized representatives of Censa Pharmaceuticals , and 
representatives of the IRB may inspect all documents and records required to be maintained 
by the Investigator, including but not limited to, medical records (office, clinic, and hospital) 
and pharmacy records for the participant s in this study. The clinical study site’s research staff 
will permit access to such records.  
The study patient’s contact information will be securely stored at each clinical site for 
internal use during the study. At the end of the study, all records will be kept in a secure location for as long a period as dictated by local IRB and Institutional regulations.  
10.6 Study Monitoring  
A clinical monitor authorized to represent Censa Pharmaceuticals will conduct site visits to inspect study data, patient’s medical r ecords, and eCRFs in acc ordance with ICH guidelines 
GCP , and applicable regulations and guidelines. The clinical monitor will also monitor 
ongoing drug accountability and adherence to protocol procedures. Details of clinical site monitoring are specified i n a Clinical Monitoring Plan.

consistently across all participating sites and that monitors are following the Clinical 
Monitoring Plan. 
The Investigator will allow repres entatives of the Censa Pharmaceuticals and regulatory 
authorities to inspect facilities and records relevant to this study.  
10.7 Case Report Forms and Study Records  
The eCRFs will be supplied by Censa Pharmaceuticals or designee for the recording of all 
informa tion and study data as specified by this protocol. Original eCRF data should be 
handled in accordance with instructions from Censa Pharmaceuticals or designee . All eCRFs 
must be completed by the clinical study site’s research staff authorized to do so by t he 
Investigator. The Investigator is responsible for ensuring the accuracy, completeness, legibility, and timeliness of the data reported.  
Data reported in the eCRF derived from source documents should be consistent with the source documents. Source docume nts are defined as records of documentation related to 
original observations and activities of a clinical investigation. Source documents may include, but are not limited to, study progress notes, study- or patient -specific email 
correspondence, computer printouts, laboratory data, and recorded data from automated instruments. All source documents produced in this study will be maintained by the Investigator and made available for inspections by Censa Pharmaceuticals  or designee and by 
regulatory authorities. The original ICF for each participating patient shall be filed with records kept by the Investigator, and copies shall be given to the patient . 
Once all data queries and issues have been resolved for each patient the Investigator will 
electronically sign each patient’s eCRF. This signature will indicate that the data have been 
thoroughly inspected and will thereby certify the contents of the eCRF. 
Clinical data will be entered into a 21 Code of Federal Regulations ( CFR ) Part 1 1-compliant 
electronic data capture system. The data system includes password protection and internal 
quality checks, such as automatic range checks, to identify data that appear inconsistent, incomplete, or inaccurate. Clinical data will be entered by the  clinical study site’s research 
staff directly from the source documents. 
10.8 Protocol Violations/Deviations 
A protocol deviation is any noncompliance with the clinical trial protocol requirements. The 
noncompliance may be either on the part of the patient, the Investigator, or the study site 
staff. Because of  deviations, corrective
 actions are to be developed by the site and 
implemented promptly. This is consistent with the following sections in ICH E6:  
• 4.5 Compliance with Protocol, Sections 4.5.1, 4.5.2, and 4.5.3 
• 5.1 Quality Assurance and Quality Control, Section 5.1.1

submission for national or international registration. If required, national or international authorities will be provided with the name of the Investigator and his or her address, full disclosure of his or her qualifications, any potential conflicts of interests, payments, and extent of involvement. 
During site visits, the clinical monitor will review original patient records, drug 
accountability records, and additional documents as needed. During the course of the study, 
Censa Pharmaceutical ’s (or designee’s ) Quality Assu rance personnel may conduct an on- site 
audit visit. The Investigator will provide direct access to and allow verification and copying of all trial- related documents ( e.g., source data ) for trial -related monitoring, audits, IRB 
reviews, and regulatory inspections. 
10.10 Data Generation and Analysis 
Some or all of the obligations of implementing or conducting this study may be transferred 
from Censa Pharmaceuticals to the CRO.  
A case report, comprised of individual eCRFs, will be completed for every patient who signs 
an ICF and is enrolled into the study. 
All original source documentation (laboratory results, treatment records, audit query 
responses, etc.) will be retained by the Investigator or institution unless specified otherwise by the protocol. The result s as they become available will be entered on the appropriate 
eCRFs. Legible reproductions of the original laboratory reports for selected tests or variables will be submitted to Censa Pharmaceuticals  or CRO as requested.  
The eCRFs will be reviewed by a cl inical monitor who will evaluate the completeness and 
accuracy of the data. Queries will be generated for omissions, corrections, and clarifications. Data may also be reviewed in -house by a clinical auditor and data management or other 
personnel. 
Data analyses will be performed after database lock, when all queries have been resolved.  
10.11 Retention of Data  
Study documents should be retained for a minimum of 2 years after the last approval of a 
marketing application in an ICH region and until there are no pending or contemplated 
marketing applications in an ICH region or until at least 2  years have elapsed since the

(CNSA -001 or placebo), and had available  Day 1 and Day 14 nutrient satiety test 
maximum tolerated volume results  
Safety will be assessed in the Safety population . Adverse events ( AEs) will be coded using the 
Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA®). The number and percentage of patients 
with TEAEs will be tabulated by system organ class, preferred term, and treatment group . Severity 
of AEs and serious adverse events ( SAEs ) will be summarized similarly . Those AEs leading to 
premature discontinuation from the study drug and the serious TEAEs will be presented in a table 
or a listing. Clinical laboratory and HbA1c  test results and vital signs will be summarized at each 
visit as will changes from baseline for each treatment group.  A frequency distribution of abnormal 
physical examination results will be provided.  
Efficacy will be assessed in the Efficacy population. The change s from Day 1 to Day 14 and from 
Day 1 to Day 28 in m aximal tolerated volume consumed during the nutrient satiety test will be 
compared between treatment groups using a student’s t -test. Results from the nutrient satiety test  
through Day 14 and Day 28, the GEBT through Day 15 and Day 27 or Day 29,  and the  GCSI 
(Section  6.8, Appendix 2 ) and PAGI -SYM  (Section 6.9, Appendix 2 ) through Day 14 (+1) and 
through Day 28 (±1) will be summarized using summary statistics (number of patients, mean, 
standard deviation, median, and range) at each visit as well as changes from baseline within each 
treatment group . The 95% confidence intervals for the changes from baseline  will be provided . 
Additional analyses may be conducted, and details will be provided in the statistical analysis pla n.

CONFIDENTIAL  1 INTRODUCTION  
1.1 Diabetic Gastroparesis   
Gastroparesis is characterized by delay ed gastric emptying in the absence of mechanical 
obstruction; symptoms are c hronic with episodic symptom exacerbation ( Parkman et al,  
2004 ). Gastroparesis affects wo men 4 times more than men (Soykan, et al, 1998 ). Idiopathic 
gastroparesis accou nts for most cases , but gastroparesis is frequently associated with di abetes 
(diabetic gastroparesis)  (Soykan, et al,  1998 ; Karamanolis  et al, 2007 ). Several 
cross -sectional studies have found delayed gastric emptying of solids and/or liquids in 30 % 
to 50% of patients wi th Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes (Horowitz et al, 2002 ). Patients with 
diabetes mellitus commonly experience gastric and intestinal dysfunction  (Feldman and 
Schiller, 1983 ).  
The actual mechanism of diabetic ga stroparesis is not well known. Vagal nerve dysfunction 
and/or damage, interstitial cells of Cajal loss, and smooth muscle and enteric neuron 
dysfunction have a ll been implicated in the pathogenesis of diabetic gastroparesis  (Stacher , 
2001 ; Parkman  et al,  2004 ). In addition, acute hyperglycemia has the potential to slow gastric 
emptying ( Camilleri  et al, 2013).  
At a molecular level,  attention has been devoted to the potential role of altered nitrergic 
signaling in the enteric nervous system. Gastric motility is regulated in large part by neurons 
of the enter ic nervous system  located in the muscle wall ( Wood et al, 1999 ). These neurons 
are either excitatory (releasing acetylcholine) or inhibitory (releasing nitric oxide [NO] and 
vasoactive intestinal peptide). Nerves throughout the luminal gastrointestinal (GI) tract 
express neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), which generates NO, a key neurotransmitter 
in the regulatio n of GI motility ( Takahashi, 2003 ); it is the principal non adrenergic 
noncholiner gic inhibitory neurotransmitter in the  GI tract. In diabetic rats , which serve a s a 
model for type 1 diabetes, n NOS expression was found to be impaired . This impairment in 
nNOS messenger RNA  expression was associated with impaired smooth muscle relaxation in 
response to electrical stimulation of circular muscle fibers obtained from the pro ximal 
stomach of these rats ( Takahashi et al, 1997 ). It has been demonst rated that female diabetic 
rats had slower gastric emptying than age matched diabetic male rats , female control rats had 
greater nitrergic relaxation of circular antral muscle strips compared to male controls , and 
nitrergic relaxation was impaired in diabe tic female rats but not matched diabetic male rats  
(Gangula et al, 2007 ). 
The core signs and symptoms of gastroparesis  by incidence  are nausea (92 % to 96 %), 
vomiting (68 % to 88 %), postprandial fullness (54 % to 77 %), early sat iety (42 % to 60 %), and 
upper abdominal pain (36 % to 85 %) (Soykan et al,  1998 ; Hoogerwerf  et al, 1999 ; Anaparthy 
et al, 2009 ). Patients may experience any combination of signs and symptoms with varying 
degrees of s everity. Pain is less prevalent  in diabetic gastroparesis  than idiopathic 
gastroparesis. Patients with diabetic  gastroparesis may experience further derangement of 
glucose cont rol because of unpred ictable gastric emptying and altered absorption of orally 
administered hypoglycemic drugs, which  may, in turn , affect measurement of core signs and 
symptoms. Severe  signs and symptoms may cause  complications such as malnutrition,

with the disease, resulting in d ecreased social interaction, poor work functionality, and 
development of anxiety or depression (Soykan et al, 1998 ; Parkman et al , 2004 ). 
1.2 Impaired Gastric Accommodation in Gastroparesis  
Patients with diabetic gastroparesis have also been shown to have gastric hypersensitivity, 
especially in the postprandial state, and impairment of the postprandial ac commodation 
response. ( Kumar et al, 2008 ). The stomach functions as 2  separate regions: the fundus acts 
as a reservoir accommodating a meal without a significant increase in intragastric pressure , 
and the distal stomach/antrum triturates gastric contents. R eceptive relaxation or 
accommodation is vagally mediated result ing in the release of NO and activation o f nitrergic 
myenteric neurons. Nitrergic signaling is responsible for gastric accommodation  and pyloric 
relaxation in response to a meal  (Ishiguchi et al, 2001 ). 
Impaired accommodation has been associated with symptoms of early satiety and weight loss 
in patients with idiopathic gastroparesis  (Karamanolis et al, 2007 ). A study of patients with 
diabetic gastroparesis found that 90% of patients had impaired gastric accommodation to a 
nutrient meal  (Kumar et al, 2008 ). In the distal stom ach, NO is required for the propulsive 
contractions that triturate gastric contents and control of pyloric closu re; lack of NO can lead 
to delayed gastric emptying and impaired gastric accommodation  (Gangula et al, 2007 ). 
Several co -factors are known to be important for nNOS activity, including nicotinamide 
adenine dinucleotide phosphate hydrogen ( NADPH ), calcium , and tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4)  
(Werner et al, 2003 ). The homodimeric conformation of all 3 isoforms of nitric oxide 
synthase (NOS ) is regulated by  BH4  (Werner et al, 2003 ). In the absence  of BH4, uncoupling 
of NO production occurs and leads to super oxide production, resulting in  further impaired 
nNOS bioactivity.  
1.3 Current Treatment of Diabetic Gastroparesis  
Therapies for gastroparesis have been targeted at accelerating gastric emptying or controlling 
symptoms . Available therapies for accelerating gastric emptying are limited in n umber and 
efficacy . These include metoclopramide  (Snape et al, 1982 ), erythromycin  (Arts et al, 2005 ), 
and domperidone (not available in the U nited States  [US] ) (Prakash  and Wagstaff, 1998 ). 
There is also poor correlation between gastric emptying and baseline  symptom severity  
(Karamanolis et al, 2007 ; Talley et al, 2001 ) and in response to therapeutic  intervention . In 
part, as a result of lack of understanding of the underlying pathogenesis that leads to 
alterations in GI motility and sensation , medical therapies have not been targeted at the 
underlying pathophysiology of gastroparesis .  
The first -line medical therapy for patients with diabetic gastroparesis  is generally a 
combination of an antiemetic agent in addition to the  promotility drug. Unfortunately, many 
patients with diabetic gastroparesis  will not experience adequate symptom relief despite 
first-line therapy. For patients with refractory disease, options include combination prokinetic 
therapy, psychotropic medications, pyloric botulinum toxin injection, and gastric electric 
stimulation  (Fass, 2010 ; Camilleri  et al, 201 3).

molecular weight of 237.2 and a molecular formula of C 9H11 N5O3. 
The chemical structure  of sepiapterin  is: 
 
Sepiapterin serves as a substrate for BH 4 synthesis via the pterin salvage pathway (Mayer  
and Werner , 1995 ). Oral administration of sepiapterin was shown to be more potent  (>2 fold) 
than oral administration of BH 4 in increasing intracellular BH 4 in normal mice  (Sawabe  et 
al, 200 2). Translation of this finding to humans has been confirmed in a Phase 1 study , 
PKU -001, conducted by Censa  Pharmaceuticals .  
1.5 Rationale for Study  
BH4 biosynthesis is impaired in chronic diabetes. The mechanism of impairment is  not well  
understood but is thought to be a result of  hyperglycemia -induced prote asome -mediated 
degradation of GTP -cyclohydrolase, the rate -limiting enzyme i n the synthesis pathway for 
BH4  (Xu et al, 2007 ).  
CNSA -001 is the first viable formulation of sepiapterin , shown to increase intracellular BH4 
(Section 1.4), intended for the treatment of female patients with diabetic gastroparesis . 
CNSA -001 was studied in a single and multiple ascending -dose study in healthy volunteers, 
the Phase 1 study, Study  PKU -001. Part A of t his study assessed the safety and 
pharmacokinetics of CNSA -001 at 6 dose levels inclusive of an assessment of food effect 
(i.e., 2.5 mg/kg, 7.5  mg/kg, 20 mg/kg, 40 mg/kg, 80 mg/kg , and 10 mg/kg [to assess food 
effect]). Additionally, K uvan® (sapropterin dihydrochloride) , a synthetic BH4 commercially 
available product , was administered at equivalent doses for the first 3 dose levels (2.5 mg/kg, 
7.5 mg/kg , and 20 mg/kg). Dose -dependent correlations between CNSA -001 and plasma 
BH4 concentr ations were observed with each successive dose level. Dose proportionality was 
observed between the top 2 dose levels (40 mg/kg and 80 mg/kg) and resultant BH4 
concentrations. Administration with a standard high -fat (approximately 50 percent of total 
caloric content of the meal) and high calorie (approximately 800 to 1000 calories) meal 
resulted in approximat ely 80% higher plasma BH4 concentrations ( area under the 
concentration time curve from 0 to the last measurement  [AUC 0-last] and maximum 
concentration  [Cmax]) than in subjects who had fasted before receipt of CNSA -001. 
Treatment -emergent adverse events (TE AEs) in Part A of Study PKU -001 were reported in 
26 subjects  (44.1%, 26/59). The TEAEs for CNSA -001 were generally mild and consistent 
with reported adverse events (AEs) for Kuvan® and placebo. The frequency of TEAEs did

study treatment were reported in 17 subjects : 11 subjects  (26.2%, 11/42) who received  
CNSA -001, 4  subjects (44.4% , 4/9) who received Kuvan®, and 2  subjects  (25.0%, 2/8) who 
received placebo. No TEAEs we re severe  or serious or led to discontinuation  of study drug . 
Headache and dizziness were the most common TEAEs , but these TEAEs occurred at a 
similar frequency as with placebo.  
Part B of Study PKU -001 assessed  multiple  ascending  doses CNSA -001 in healthy  
volunteers . Data indicate CNSA -001 was well tolerated following daily doses of 5, 20 , and 
60 mg/kg/day for 7 days and that TEAEs were reported in 14 subjects (58.3%, 14/24). The 
TEAEs in subjects who received CNSA 001 were mild or moderate and co nsistent with the 
TEAEs  in subjects who received placebo: T EAEs were experienced by 10 subjects (55.6%,  
10/18) who received  CNSA -001 at doses from  5 mg/kg to 60 mg/kg daily for 7  days and by 
4 subjects (66 .7%, 4/6) who received placebo.  No TEAEs were severe, seriou s, or led to 
discontinuation. Of the 10 TEAEs reported in subjects who received  CNSA -001, only 4 were 
judged to be related  to study drug , and , of the 4 TEAEs reported in subjects who received  
placebo , only 1 was judged to be related  to study drug . Somnolen ce, fatigue, headache, and 
procedural pain (secondary to performance of 2 seque ntial lumbar punctures 7 days a part) 
were the most common TEAEs reported , and they occurred at a similar frequency when 
compared with placebo with the exception of fatigue and h eadach e, which were each 
reported in 2 subjects who received CNSA -001 (11.1%, 2/18).  
This Phase 2 pilot study will assess CNSA -001 doses of  20 mg/kg /day administered as 
10 mg/kg  twice a day ( BID) in comparison to placebo administered BID  in female patients  
with diabetic gastroparesis . This study will help support the design  of future Phase 2/3 
studies in  patients  with diabetic gastroparesis .

Screening Period (Day -28 Through Day 1 Predose)  
An informed consent form (ICF) must be signed before any study -related procedures are 
performed. After providing consent, patients will unde rgo Screening procedures to determine 
study eligibility, as indicated in Appendix  1. Patients who are eligible based on Screening 
evaluations will undergo baseline evaluations before initiation of study drug (CNSA -001 or 
placeb o), be randomized,  and proceed to the Treatment Period.  
Treatment Period ( Day 1 Through Day 14) 
Following the Screening Period  and completion of baseline evaluations , all randomized 
patients will take their  first dose of study drug (CNSA -001 or placebo ) on Day 1 while in the 
clinic.  Patients will undergo procedures during the Treatment Period as indicated in 
Appendix  1. 
Study drug may be prematurely discontinued for safety reasons, as described in 
Section  6.14.1 . Patients may also withdraw  from the study for any reason, as described in 
Section  6.14.2 . If a patien t discontinues study drug early , the patient should return to the 
study site within 24 hours of withdrawal and complete all of the procedures outlined for the 
End of Treatment (EOT) (Section 7.5, Appendix  1). If a patient  withdraws early from the 
study  before undergoing EOT evaluations , the patient will be asked to return to the study site 
within 24 hours of withdrawal and complete all of the procedures outlined for the EOT 
(Section 7.5, Appendix  1). If a patient withdraws from the study before undergoing End of 
Study (EOS) evaluations, the patient will be asked to return to the study site within 24  hours 
of withdrawal and complete all of the procedur es outlined for the EO S (Section 7.6, 
Appendix  1).

3.2 Rationale for Study Design and Control Group  
CNSA -001 (sepiapterin) is a new chemical entity that is an endogenous, naturally occurring 
precursor of BH 4 via the pterin salvage pathway . Animal studies and data from a Phase 1 
single and multiple ascending -dose study in healthy volunteers conducted by Censa 
Pharmaceuticals  indicat e rapid intracellular conversion of sepiapterin to BH 4. It is expected 
that oral administration of CNSA -001 to women with diabetic gastroparesis  will result in 
increases in both intracellular and circulating BH 4 concentrations. In chronic diabetes, BH4 
biosynthesis is impaired (Xu et al, 2007 ). 
CNSA -001 was studied in two 14 -day Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) toxicity studies , as 
described in Section 5.3, and in  a single and multiple ascending -dose study in healthy 
volunteers, Study PKU -001, as described in Section 1.5.

their assigned study drug, t he study design of a randomized  study  of CNSA -001 versus 

CNSA -001 (sepiapterin)                                                                                                        Censa Pharmaceuticals

CONFIDENTIAL  5 STUDY TREATMENTS  
5.1 Description of Treatments  
5.1.1 Test Product  
The test product is CNSA -001 (sepiapterin) oral powder for suspension.  CNSA -001 contains 
the new chemical entity, sepiapterin. S epiapterin is 2 -amino -6-[(2S) -2-hydroxypropanoyl] -
7,8-dihydro -1H-pteridin -4-one with a molecular weight of 237.2 and a molecular formula of 
C9H11 N5O3. Inactive ingredients in CNSA -001 include microcrystalline cellulose, colloidal 
silicon dioxide, croscarm ellose, and ascorbic acid. CNSA -001 will be suspended in Medisca® 
Oral Mix prior to dispensing it to the patient .  
5.1.2 Placebo  Control  
The placebo is a  ready -made  suspension containing microcrystalline cellulose, colloidal 
silicon dioxide, croscarmellose, ascorbic acid , and colorant (Yellow No. 6) that is suspended 
in Medisca® Oral Mix.   
5.2 Treatments Administered  
Patients will be randomized in a ratio of 1:1 to the following treatment  groups :  
• CNSA -001 20 mg/kg/day  (10 mg/kg  BID) for 14 days 
• Placebo BID for 14 days  
Dosing of CNSA -001 is based on the patient’s weight . The weight obtained on Day -1 will 
be used to calculate the exact amount ( mg) of CNSA -001 active ingredient  (sepiapterin ) 
required for each patient’s daily dose .  
The placebo  is formulated as ready -made suspension . The placebo will be administered in the 
same manner (volume) as CNSA -001. 
Details on preparation of study drug  and dosing guidelines will be provided in a pharmacy 
manual for the site and an instruction guide for patients .  
5.3 Selection and Timing of Dose for Each Patient  
All patients will be randomly assigned in a ratio of 1:1 to receive CNSA -001 20 mg/kg/day  
(10 mg/kg  BID)  or placebo  BID.  
The CNSA -001 dose was selected following completion of two 14 -day GLP  toxicity studies 
in the rat and marmo set. The no observed adverse effect level  from both studies was set at 
1000 mg/kg/day , which represents a human equivalent dose of 161.3  mg/kg/da y based on

CONFIDENTIAL  Study drug will be dispensed on Day 1 (Section  6.11) with a dosing diary  in which  patient s 
will record all doses taken and times they were taken  (Section  5.8.1 ). The first dose on Day 1 
will be taken in the clinic  after patient s undergo the nutrient satiety test  (Section 6.7). 
If a patient vomits after taking a dose of study drug , the patient should wai t until the next 
scheduled time point to take another  dose. A missed dose should be taken as soon as possible, 
but >2 doses should not be taken on the same day.  
5.4 Method of Assigning Patients  to Treatment Groups  
Patients who fulfill the eligibility criteria  and provide informed consent  will be randomized 
in a ratio of 1:1 to the CNSA -001 or placeb o group  via the randomization scheme generated 
for the study . Patients who are randomized will be considered to be enrolled.  
5.5 Blinding  
This study has a double -blind design.  The Investigator , study personnel, and patient s will not 
make any effort to determine which study d rug is being received.  Unblinded pharmacy (or 
other qualified site ) personnel  will be utilized in this study to prepare the study drug.  
Patients will be blinded to study drug assignment. Only in an emergency, when knowledge of 
the study drug is essential f or the clinical management or welfare of a specific patient , may 
the Investigator unblind a patient’s study drug assignment. Copies of the randomization 
sequence and treatment codes will  be kept in the pharmacy at the sites . If emergency 
unblinding is requ ired, the Investigator will have immedi ate access to individual sealed  codes 
containing treatment allocation s. However , before any unblinding occurs, the Investigator is 
strongly advised to discuss options with the Sponsor’s Medical Monitor or appropriate 
Sponsor study personnel. As soon as possible and without revealing the patient ’s study drug 
assignment (unless important to the safety of patient s remaining in the study), the 
Investigator must notify the Sponsor if the blind is broken for any reason and t he Investigator 
was unable to contact the Sponsor prior to the unblinding. The Investigator will record in 
source documentation the date and reason for revealing the blinded study drug assignment 
for any patient  and the names  and roles of personnel unblinded . 
5.6 Concomitant Therapy  
Patients will be permitted to take:  
• Analgesics, including narcotics , if the patient has been on a stable dose of the 
medication for > 30 days before  randomization;  dose escalation is NOT permitted 
during the study through the EOT  
• Promotility agent s, including  metoclopramide  if the patient has been on a stable dose 
of the medication > 30 days before  randomization; dose changes are NOT  permitted

6.7 Nutrient Satiety Test  
For t he nutrient satiety test , patients  consum e 150 mL of Ensure ™ every 5 minutes. At 
5-minute intervals, patien ts score their fullness using a rating scale that combines verbal 
descriptors on a scale graded 0  to 5 (0: no symptoms, 1: first sensation of fullness [threshold], 
2: mild, 3: moderate, 4: severe and 5:  maximum or unbearable fullness). Patients are  told to 
stop whe n a score of 5 is obtained. The actual volume of Ensure ™ consumed at this point is 
the maximum tolerated volume. Symptoms are measured 30 minutes after comple ting the test 
with pa tients scoring each symptom  of bloating, fullness, nausea and pain on a visua l 
analogue scale with 100 -mm lines and the words “unnoticeable” and “unbearable” as 
anch ors. The sum of the four 100 -mm visual analogue scales provides an aggregate symptom 
score  (Park, 2011 ). 
The nutrient satiety test  will be a dministered in the clinic at Screening, on Day 1 (predose) , 
and on Day 14 and Day 28 after overnight fasts and after any medications that can alter GI 
sensation  or accommodation or gastric emptying have been held  overnight . A nutrient satiety 
test volume of ≤600 mL at Screening is required for patients to participate in this study.  
6.8 Gastroparesis Cardinal Symptom Index  
The GCSI  (Appendix 2 ) consisting of a subset of items from the PAGI -SYM  instrument  
(Section 6.9, Appendix 2 ), will be administered in the clinic at Screening  and on Day 1 
(predose ), Day 14 (+1  day), and Day 28 (±1 day). A GCSI score >21  at Screening , indicating 
moderate to severe symptoms, is required for patient s to participate in this study.  
6.9 Patient Assessment of Upper Gastrointestinal Disorders -Symptom 
Severity  
The PAGI -SYM  (Appendix 2 ) is a 20-item upper GI symptom severity instrument  with 
6 subscales: heartburn/regurgitation, fullness/early satiety, nausea/vomiting, bloating, upper 
abdominal pain, and lower abdominal pain. It will be administered in the clinic on Day 1 
(predose) and on Day 14 (+1  day), and Day  28 (± 1 day).  
6.10 Gastric Emptying Breath Test  
The GEBT , which is a nonradioactive noninvasive test , will be administered in the clinic on 
Day -1, Day 15, and Day 27 or Day 29 after the patient has fasted overnight  (a minimum of 
8 hours before  test administration  with the exception of 4 ounces of water up to 1  hour before 
the test ). At the clinic , the p atient provides baseline (pre meal) breath sample s and then 
consumes a  standardized 230 kCal meal , consisting o f a proprietary standardized  13C-labeled 
egg component (which is rehydrated and then microwave d for 1.5 minutes ) and 6  saltine 
crackers , accompanied by 6 ounces of water . The meal is to be consumed within 10  minutes. 
Single postmeal breath samples are  collected in capped glass tubes at 45, 90,  120, 150, 180, 
and 240 minutes after  the meal is consumed and sent to the specified local laboratory for

CONFIDENTIAL  analysis  by Gas Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometry . By adding 13C to the test meal, the GEBT 
can determine how fast the stomach empties the mea l by measuring the rate of carbon -13 
dioxide (13CO 2) excretion arising from the digested test meal. The rate of 13CO 2 excretion 
found in the patient’s breath is proportional to the patient’s rate of gastric emptying. The 
patient’s 13CO 2 excretion rate at e ach breath collection time is reported using the GEBT 
metric “kPCD.” The “k” is a multiplier of 1000 , and “PCD” is an acronym for percent 13C 
dose excreted (as 13CO 2). The test should not be administered to patient s with a known 
allergy to egg, wheat, or algae ( Spirulina ) (Cairn Diagnostics ™; Sutton  et al, 2015 ; GEBT  
package insert, 2015 ; United States Food and Drug Administration, 20 15).  
6.11 Dispensing Study Drug   
Study drug will be dispensed on Day 1 along with a dosing diary to record all doses taken 
and times they were taken.  A sufficient supply of study drug will be dispensed for dosing 
through Day 14. Details on the preparation of study drug , dosing guidelines , and storage  will 
be provided in a pharmacy manual for the site and an instruction guide for patients . 
6.12 Adverse Events Assessments  
An AE  is defined as any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of an 
intervention i n humans, whether or not considered intervention -related.  
The occurrence of an AE or serious adverse event ( SAE ) (Section 6.12.6 ) may come to the 
attention of study personnel during study visits and interviews of a study patient presenting 
for medical care, or upon review by a study monitor. All AEs including local and  systemic 
reactions not meeting the criteria for SAEs will be captured on the appropriate eCRF. 
Information to be collected includes , but is not limited to, the  event description, time of 
onset, clinician’s assessment of severity, relationship to study drug (assessed only by those 
with the training and authority to make a diagnosis), and date of resolution/stabilization of 
the event. Action taken regarding study medication (e.g., d rug withdrawn, interrupted ) will 
also be collected in the eCRF. All AEs that start during the study must be documented 
appropriately regardless of relationship. All treatment -related AEs or AEs leading to 
discontinuation will be followed to an adequate resolution , as determined by the Investigator . 
Any medical condition that is present at the time that the patient is screened  will be 
considered as medical history  and not reported as an AE. However, if the patient’s condition 
deteriorates at any time during the study, it will be recorded as an AE.  
Changes in the severity of an AE will be documented to allow an assessment of the duration 
of the event at each level of severity to be performed. The AEs characterized as intermittent 
require documentation of onset and duration of each episode.  
6.12.1  Reporting Tim elines  
The Investigator will record all reportable events  with start dates occurring any time after 
informed consent and continue through clinical study completion or, in the case of 
withdrawal, until the outcome is determined. The AEs will be  assessed at each visit and/or

drug must be reported within 24  hours of the knowledge of the event by study personnel 
whether or not considered to be related to study drug.  
Death s that occur ≥ 30 (±3) days after the patient’s last st udy dose must be reported within 
24 hours of knowledge of the event , if deemed related to study drug by the Investigator.  
Although pregnancy is not considered an AE or SAE by regulatory definition, for this study 
pregnancies must be processed following  SAE  timelines (e.g., within 24 hours of knowledge 
of the pregnancy)  for data transmission purposes. In the event that a pregnancy complication 
occurs , or elective termination of a pregnancy is required for medical reasons, then the 
complication will be record ed as an AE or SAE , as appropriate.  
While elective and uncomplicated induced abortion not required for medical reasons does not 
constitute an AE or SAE (even if the  patient  or patient ’s partner is hospitalized to undergo 
abortion), spontaneous abortion is considered a fatal event and must be reported as an AE 
and SAE , as appropriate.  
Any pregnancy and/or suspected pregnancy that occurs during the study in a female patient 
should be reported  using  Pregnancy Reporting Form within 24 hours of knowledge of the 
event by study personnel . Any pregnancy and/or suspected pregnancy will be followed for 
outcome.  
If the patient has received the investigational drug prior to becoming pregnant, the patient 
will continue the efficacy assessment and Follow -up periods and measures of safety and 
efficacy will be obtained.  
The patient will be  followed until the  outcome of the pregnancy is determined. It is the 
responsibili ty of the Investigator to obt ain and document pregnancy information on the  most 
recent Pregnancy Report Form. Furthermore, any SAE o ccurring as an outcome of the 
pregnancy must be  reported according to the procedures outlined for SAE reporting.

AMENDMENT 2: 12 Nov 2018  
 
CONFIDENTIAL  6.12.2  Severity  
The intensity of each AE will be graded as follows:  
Mild:  Events require minimal or no treatment and do not interfere with the 
patient’s daily activities.  
Moderate:  Events result in a low level of inconvenience or concern with the therapeutic 
measures. Moderate events may cause some interference with functioning .  
Severe:  Events interrupt a patient’s usual daily activity and may require systemic 
drug therapy or other treatment. Severe events are usually potentially 
life-threatening or incapacitating.  
 
It is important to distinguish between seri ous and severe AEs. Severity is a measure of 
intensity; however, an AE of severe intensity need not necessarily be considered serious. For 
example, nausea that persists for several hours may be considered severe nausea but may not 
be considered an SAE. Alt ernatively, a stroke that results in only a limited degree of 
disability may be considered only a mild stroke but would be considered an SAE.  
6.12.3  Relationship  
The Investigator’s assessment of causality must be provided for all AEs (serious and 
nonserious). An Investigator’s causality assessment is the determination of whether there 
exists a reasonable possibility that the study drug caused or contributed to an AE. For 
purposes of consistency, guidelines for assessing causality are provided  below : 
CNSA -001 (sepiapterin)                                                                                                        Censa Pharmaceuticals  
Clinical Trial Protocol: GAS -001                                                                                                                 Page 39 
AMENDMENT 2: 12 Nov 2018  
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Not Related  The AE is completely independent of study drug administration, and/or 
evidence  exists that the event is definitely related to another etiology. There 
must be an alternative,  definitive etiolo gy documented by the clinician.  
No relationship between the experience and the administration of study 
drug; related to other etiologies such as concomitant medications or 
patient’s clinical state.  
Unlikely  to be 
Related  A clinical event, including an abnormal laboratory test result, wh ose 
temporal relationship to drug administration makes a causal relationship 
improbable (e.g., the  event did not occur within a reasonable time after 
administration of the trial medication) and in  which other drugs or chemicals 
or underlying disease provid es plausible explanations (e.g., the  patient’s 
clinical condition, other concomitant treatments).  
Possibl y 
Related  There is some evidence to suggest a causal relationship (e.g., the event 
occurred within a reasonable time after administration of the trial  
medication). However, other factors may have contributed to the event 
(e.g.,  the patient’s clinical condition, other concomitant events). Although 
an AE may rate only as “possibly related” soon after discovery, it can be 
flagged as requiring more informat ion and later be upgraded to “probably 
related” or  “definitely related,” as appropriate.  
Probabl y 
Related  There is evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and the influence of other 
factors is unlikely. The clinical event, including an abnormal laboratory test 
result, occurs within a reasonable time after administration of the drug, is 
unlikely to be attributed to concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals, 
and follows a clinically reasonable response on withdrawal (dechallenge). 
Rechallenge information is not required to fulfill this definition .  
Definite ly 
Related  There is clear evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and other possible 
contributing factors can be ruled out. The clinical event, including an 
abnormal laboratory test resul t, occurs in a plausible time relationship to 
drug administration and cannot be explained by concurrent disease or other 
drugs or chemicals. The response to withdrawal of the drug (dechallenge) 
should be clinically plausible. The event must be pharmacologi cally or 
phenomenologically definitive, with use of a satisfactory rechallenge 
procedure if necessary .  
 
These criteria, in addition to good clinical judgment, should be used as a guide for 
determining the causal assessment. If the event is believed to be  unrelated to study drug 
administration, then an alternative explanation should be provided , if available . 
6.12.4  Expectedness  
An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered “unexpected ” if it is not listed in the 
Investigators’ Brochure or is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed; 
CNSA -001 (sepiapterin)                                                                                                        Censa Pharmaceuticals  
Clinical Trial Protocol: GAS -001                                                                                                                 Page 40 
AMENDMENT 2: 12 Nov 2018  
 
CONFIDENTIAL  or, if an Investigators’ Brochure  is not required or available, is not consistent with the risk 
information described in the general  investigational plan or elsewhere in the protocol.  
The drug safety medical reviewer will be responsible for determining whether an AE is 
expected or unexpected. An AE will be considered unexpected if the nature, severity, or 
frequency of the event is not consistent with the risk information previously described for the 
study agent  (e.g., Investigators’ Brochure ). 
6.12.5  Clinical Laboratory Adverse Events  
Laboratory abnormalities should not be recorded as AEs or SAEs unless they are associated 
with clinical signs or symptoms or require medical intervention , as determined by the 
Investigator . However, each laboratory abnormality ( e.g., clinically significant changes 
detected in hematology, serum chemistry panel , urinalysis, urine microscopic , and HbA1c  
evaluations) independent from any underlying medical condition that requires medical or 
surgical intervention, or that leads to study drug interruption or discontinuation, must be 
recorded as an AE, or SAE if applicable. If the laboratory abnormality is part of a clini cal 
condition or syndrome, it should be recorded as the syndrome or diagnosis rather than as the 
individual laboratory abnormality. In addition, laboratory abnormalities or other abnormal 
test assessments ( e.g., vital signs ) performed that are associated w ith signs or symptoms must 
be recorded as AEs or SAEs if they meet the definition of an AE (or SAE) as described 
below.  
6.12.6  Serious Adverse Events  
6.12.6.1  Definition  
An SAE is defined as an AE or suspected adverse reaction  occurring at any dose that results 
in any of the following outcomes: death, life -threatening AE, in patient  hospitalization or 
prolongation of existing hospitalization, a persistent or significant disability/incapacity or a 
substantial disruption of the ab ility to conduct normal life functions, or a congenital 
anomaly/birth defect.  
An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered ‘‘life -threatening’’ if, in the view of either 
the Investigator or Sponsor, its occurrence places the patient at immediate risk of death. It 
does not include an AE or suspected adverse reaction that, had it occurred in a more severe 
form, might have caused death.  
Important medical events that may not result in death, be li fe-threatening, or require 
hospitalization may be considered an SAE when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, 
they may jeopardize the patient and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 
one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Ex amples of such medical events include 
allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood 
dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization, or the development of 
drug dependency or drug abuse.  Medical and scientific judg ment  should be exercised in 
deciding whether expedited reporting is appropriate in these other situations.

AMENDMENT 2: 12 Nov 2018  
 
CONFIDENTIAL  6.12.6.2  Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction (SUSAR)  
The Sponsor must submit a safety report for any suspected adverse r eaction to study 
treatment that is both serious and unexpected. Before submitting a safety report, the Sponsor 
needs to ensure that the event meets all 3 of the definitions:  
• Suspected adverse reaction  
• Serious  
• Unexpected  
If the AE does not meet all 3 of the definitions, it should not be submitted as a safety report.  
6.12.6.3  Reporting Serious Adverse Events  
The Investigator will report all SAEs to the designated drug safety team within 24  hours of 
knowledge of the event wh ether or not consid ered to be  related to study drug using the SAE 
Report Form provided.  
Although not all information required for a complete SAE Report Form may be readily 
available at the time of the event, the Investigator must include sufficient information on the 
SAE Report Form to allow for a complete medical assessment. This should include at a 
minimum the patient number, site number, detailed description of the event, seriousness 
criteria, causality/relationship to study drug , and Investigator signature . 
The designated drug safety team will  acknowledge the receipt of the SAE via e mail to the 
clinical site. After submission of the initial report, the Investigator will provide follow -up 
information to the drug safety team as requested (e.g., concomitant medications, hospital 
discharge summary)  to further evaluate the event and assure that all appropriate information 
is received. Once all information is received and the SAE has been deemed appropriate for 
closure, the SAE Report Form must be signed and dated by the Investigator.  
The Investigator is responsible  for informing  the Institutional Review Board ( IRB) of the 
SAE in accordance with institution al policies and procedures including relevant initi al and 
follow -up in formation about the  SAE. 
Treatment -related SAEs or events leading to discontinuation of study drug will be followed 
for outcome information until resolution or stabilization. Other supporting documentation of 
the event may be requested by Censa Pharmaceuticals (or designee ) and should be provided 
as soon as possible. The Medical Monitor should be contacted when the Investigator 
considers an SAE to be treatment -related.  
6.12.7  Treatment -Emergent Adverse Events  
Those AEs that start at the time of or after the first dose of study drug  are TEAEs . Those AEs 
that worsen at or after the time of first dose of study drug are also considered 
treatment -emergent. All AEs that occur on or after the ICF has been signed, including all 
TEAEs, through Day 29 will be recorded in the eCRF.

AMENDMENT 2: 12 Nov 2018  
 
CONFIDENTIAL  All SAEs through Day 44 ±3 days [30 ±3 days after the patient received last dose of study 
drug] will be recorded in the eCRF  and reported as described in Section 6.12.6.3 . 
6.13 Prior and Concomitant Medication Assessments  
All prescription and over -the-counter medications (including herbal medications) taken by a 
patient starting from the 30 -day period before Screening through Day 28 (±1 day) before the 
patient leaves the clinic after completion of all EOS evaluations will be recorded. Any 
concomitant medications added or discontinued during the study will be recorded at each 
visit.  
6.14 Removal of Patients  From the Trial or Study Drug  
6.14.1  Early Disco ntinuation From Study Drug Administration  
Premature discontinuation of study drug administration is defined as the discontinuation of 
study drug for an individual patient before the required full cou rse of study drug is 
completed.  Reasons for premature dis continuation from study drug administration should be 
recorded on the appropriate page(s) of the eCRF and may include, but are not limited to the 
following:  
• Occurrence of a n AE, SAE,  or clinically significant laboratory abnormality that, in the 
opinion of the Investigator, warrants the patient’s permanent discontinuation from study 
drug administration  
• In the judgment of the Investigator, the patient experiences a general or specific 
change(s) that renders the patient unsuitable for continued study drug administr ation  
• There is a need for concomitant medication that makes the patient ineligible for further 
study drug administrati on 
• Pregnancy  
• Specific  reasons related  to adverse events that have been observed in pre - and post -
marketing treatment with the sam e drug class of CNSA -001 (i.e., sapropterin):  
o Hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis  
o Gastritis  
o Abnormal liver function tests in patients with liver impairment  
o Unexplained hyperactivity  
Given the requirement for pregnancy testing in women of ch ildbearing potential at Screening 
and the requirement for highly effective methods of contraception during the study, it is 
unlikely that pregnancies will occur during study conduct. However, study drug will be 
discontinued should suspected or confirmed pr egnancy or nursing during the  study drug 
administration period occur.  
CNSA -001 (sepiapterin)                                                                                                        Censa Pharmaceuticals

AMENDMENT 2: 12 Nov 2018  
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Patients who prematurely discontinue study drug due to any of the above reasons will  
complete the EOT  assessments  within  24 hours of withdrawal .  
6.14.2  Withdrawal From the Study  
Patients may w ithdraw from the study for any reason or be withdrawn at the request of the 
Investigator or Sponsor. The reason for a patient ’s withdrawal must be recorded on the 
appropriate page(s) of the eCRF. Reasons for withdrawal from the study may include, but are 
not limited to:  
• Withdrawal of consent   
• AEs or SAEs  
• Significant patient  noncompliance, defined as refusal or inability to adhere to the protocol 
requirements  
• The Investigator determines that it is in the best interest of the patient to withdraw from 
study participation, due to a reason other than safety  
Each patient who withdraws from the study after receipt of any amount of study drug will be 
asked to undergo EOT  assessments. However, patients may withdraw consent to participate 
in this study at any time w ithout penalty.  Withdrawn patients  who receive any amount  of 
study drug,  will not be replaced.  Withdrawn p atients who do not receive any study drug will 
be replaced.  
6.14.3  Study Stopping Criteria  
The study may be terminated if significant violations of Good Clinical Practice ( GCP ) that 
compromise the ability to achieve the study objectives or compromise patient  safety are 
observed at any time during the study. With regard to safety, the study may be temporarily 
suspended or terminated should the Investigator,  Sponsor, or IRB determine that the safety of 
patients  is significantly jeopardized. The decision for a temporary or permanent study hold 
will depend on the nature, frequency, and severity of AEs that were observed in all enrolled 
patients to date. For exa mple, the study will be temporarily or permanently halted should 
either of the following occur:  
• The presence of the same system organ class (e,g., gastrointestinal, cardiac , etc. ) 
severe  AE for which no other alternative etiology can be identified, conside red 
related to study drug, in 2 or more patients  (Severity defined in Section 6.12.2 ). 
• The presence of life -threatening AE or AE requiring urgent intervention in 1 or more 
patients.  
• Death related to Adverse Event.

CONFIDENTIAL  In a temporary study hold, no additional patients will be enrolled into the study or dosed with 
study drug until the study team members (including the Investigator and the Medical 
Monitor) decide it is safe to proceed with the study.  
  
6.15 Appropriateness of M easurements  
Safety will be measured by AEs (including SAEs), vital signs, physical examinations, and 
clinical laboratory and HbA1c  tests.  
Because treatment with BH4 is hypothesized to restore nNOS function in the control of 
gastric accommodation, the nutrient satiety test (Section 6.7) was chosen for the primary 
endpoint for this study . Gastric accommodation has been measured using ultrasonography  
(Undeland et al , 1998 ), single -photon emission computed tomography (Bredenoord et al, 
2003 ), and barostat testing  (Coulie et al, 1998 ; Sarnelli et  al, 2001 ). Barostat studies have 
been shown to be reproducible  (Sarnelli et al, 2001 ) but are invasive and not widely 
available. Satiety testing using a nutrient liquid has been shown to be reproducible  (Kindt et 
al, 2008 ) and correlate with impairment in gastric accommodation but not gastric emptying 
or visceral sensitivity  (Tack et al, 2003 ). 
The GEBT  is nonradioactive,  noninvasive test of gastric emptying rate that has been 
validated against the reference method of gastric scintigraphy . It has been  accepte d by the 
United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in the measurement of the rate of 
gastric emptying of solids and as an aid in the diagnosis of del ayed gastric emptying 
(gastroparesis) in adult humans who are symptomatic for gastroparesis. The GEBT can 
determine how fast the stomach empties a standardized  meal with a 13C-labeled egg 
component by measuring the ratio of 13CO 2 to carbon -12 dioxide (12CO 2) collected in breath 
samples at multiple time points after the meal is consumed compared to baseline. The breath 
samples are collected in capped glass tubes and sent to a specified local laboratory for 
analysis. By measuring the change in the ratio of 13CO 2 to 12CO 2 over time in comparison to 
the premeal value, the rate of 13CO 2 excretion can be calculated and the gastric emptying rate 
determined. The GEBT does not require administration by specially trained health care 
professionals or special precaution s related to radiation -emitting compounds  (Section 6.10).  
The GCSI  (Section  6.8, Appendix 2 ), consisting of a subset of items from the PAGI -SYM 
instrumen t (Section 6.9, Appendix 2 ) (described below), is based on reviews of the medical 
literature and results from clinician interviews and patient focus groups. Its reliability and 
validity were examined in 169 gastroparesis patients from 7  clinical centers in the US. 
Patients completed the GCSI, SF -36 Health Survey, and disability day questions at baseline 
and again at 8 weeks. Clinicians independently rated the severity of the patients' symptoms, 
and both clini cians and patients rated the changes in gastroparesis -related symptoms over the 
8weeks. For the GCSI total score, the internal consistency reliability was 0.84, and the test -
re-test reliability was 0.76. Significant relationships were observed between the clinician -
assessed symptom severity and the GCSI total score, and significant associations were found 
between the GCSI scores and SF -36 physical and mental component summary scores and 
restricted activity and bed disability days. Patients with greater symp tom severity, as rated by 
CNSA -001 (sepiapterin)                                                                                                        Censa Pharmaceuticals

CONFIDENTIAL  clinicians, reported greater symptom severity on the GCSI. The GCSI total scores were 
responsive to changes in overall gastroparesis symptoms as assessed by clinicians 
(p = 0.0002) and patients (p  = 0.002) ( Revicki et al, 2003 ). 
The PAGI -SYM  (Section 6.9, Appendix 2 ) is a 20-item upper GI symptom severity 
instrument  with 6  subscales: heartburn/regurgitation, fullness/early satiety, nausea/vomiting, 
bloating, upper  abdominal pain, and lower abdominal pain. To develop the instrument, 
patients with GERD (n  = 810), dyspepsia (n  = 767), or g astroparesis (n  = 169) from the US, 
France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, and Poland completed the PAGI -SYM, the SF -36 
Health Su rvey, a disease -specific health -related quality of life  measure ( Patient Assessment 
of Upper Gastrointes tinal Disorders -Quality of Life [PAGI -QOL]), and disability day 
questions. Two -week reproducibility was evaluated in 277 stable patients. Construct vali dity 
was evaluated by correlating subscale scores with SF -36, PAGI -QOL and global symptom 
severity scores and disability days. Internal consistency reliability ranged from 0.79 to 0.91, 
and test -retest reliability ranged from 0.60 to 0.82 for the PAGI -SYM subscales. The 
PAGI -SYM subscale scores correlated significa ntly with SF -36 scores (all p < 0.0001), 
PAGI -QOL scores (all p <0.0001), disability days (p  <0.0001), and global symptom severity 
(p <0.0001). Mean PAGI -SYM scores varied significantly in groups d efined by disability 
days (all p <0.0001), in which greater symptom severity was associated with more disability 
days (Rentz et al, 2004 ; Revicki et al, 2004 ).

CONFIDENTIAL  9 PLANNED STATISTICAL METHODS  
9.1 Gener al Considerations  
Descriptive statistics, including numbers and percentages for categorical variables, and 
numbers, means, standard deviations, medians, minimums, and maximums for continuous 
variables will be provided. Exploratory analyses may also be perf ormed. Listings of 
individual patient data will be produced. Additional details can be found in the  statistical 
analysis plan . 
9.2 Determination of Sample  Size 
The primary objective of this study is to assess the impact of CNSA -001 on gastric 
accommodation , as measured by nutrient satiety testing (Section 6.7), in women with 
moderate to severe diabetic gastroparesis . A total of 10 patients will be enr olled in each 
treatment group. If it is assume d that the standard deviation for the change from baseline in 
nutrient meal volume ingested is approximately 2 35 mL ( data on file ), and using a one -sided 
t-test at the 0.025 significance level, this trial has 80% power to detect  a treatment difference 
greater than 288 mL (i.e., an effect size of 1.23) i n the CNSA -001group. The study also has 
90% power to detect a treatment difference greater than 330 mL (i.e., an effect size of 1.41) 
in the CNSA -001 group.  
9.3 Analysis Populations  
Two study populations will be analyzed:  
• Safety population: all patients who were randomized and received any amount of study 
drug (CNSA -001 or placebo ) 
• Efficacy population: all patients who were randomized, received any amount of study 
drug (CNSA -001 or placebo), and had available Day 1 predose and Day 14 nutrient 
satiety test (Section 6.7) maximum tolerated volume results  
9.4 Demographics , Baseline Characteristics , Enrollment, Protocol Deviations, 
and Patient Disposition  
Enrollment, protocol deviations, demographics (age, sex , race/ethnicity ), prior and 
concomitant me dications, and medical history  will be summarized by treatment group using 
descriptive statistics. Discontinuations from study drug and the study will be summarized by 
treatment group as well  and the reasons for discontinuation will be listed . 
9.5 Statistical Analysis of Efficacy  Variables  
Efficacy will be assessed in the Efficacy population.  
The primary  efficacy measure will be the change s in maximal tolerated volume consumed 
during the nutrient satiety test (Section 6.7) from Day 1  to Day 14 and Day  28. The change s 
from Day 1 to Day 14 and from Day 1 to Day 28 in maximal tolerated volume consumed

t-test.  
Secondary efficacy measures will consist of changes in the following from baseline through 
Day 14 (± 1 day) and through Day 28 (±1 day):  
• PAGI -SYM (Section 6.9, Appendix 2 ) subscale (heartburn/regurgitation, fullness/early 
satiety, nausea/vomiting, bloating, upper abdominal pain, and lower abdominal pain ) 
scores  
• Gastric emptying as measured by the GEBT  (Section 6.10) 
The primary and secondary measures will be summarized by treatment group at each visit as 
well as changes from baseline using summary statistics (number of patients, mean, standard 
deviation, median, and range) including 95% confidence intervals  for changes from baseline . 
Additional analyses may be conducted, and details will b e provided in the statistical analysis 
plan (SAP).  
9.6 Safety Analysis  
Safety will be assessed in the Safety population. The AEs  will be coded using the Medical 
Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA®). The number and perc entage of patients 
with TEAEs  will be tabulated by system organ class, preferred term, and treatment group. 
Severity of AEs and SAEs  will be summarized similarly. Those AEs leading to premature 
discontinuation from the study drug and the serious TEAEs will be presented in a table or a 
listing. Clinical laboratory and HbA1c  test results and vital signs will be summarized at each 
visit as will changes from baseline for each treatment group.  A frequency distribution of 
abnormal physical examination results will be provided.  Additional detail s will be provided

CONFIDENTIAL  Independent audits may be conducted to ensure that monitoring practices are performed 
consistently across all participating sites and that monitors are following the Clinical 
Monitoring Plan . 
The Investigator will allow representatives of the Censa Pharmaceuticals and regulatory 
authorities to inspect facilities and records relevant to this study.  
10.7 Case Report Forms and Study Records  
The eCRFs will be supplied by Censa Pharmaceuticals or designee for the recording of all 
information and study data as specified by this protocol. Original eCRF data should be 
handled in accordance with instructions from Censa Pharmaceuticals  or designee . All eCRFs 
must be completed by the clinical study site’s research staff authorized to do s o by the 
Investigator. The Investigator is responsible for ensuring the accuracy, completeness, 
legibility, and timeliness of the data reported.  
Data reported in the eCRF derived from source documents should be consistent with the 
source documents. Source documents are defined as records of documentation related to 
original observations and activities of a clinical investigation. Source documents may 
include, but are not limited to, study progress notes, study - or patient -specific email 
correspondence, comp uter printouts, laboratory data, and recorded data from automated 
instruments. All source documents produced in this study will be maintained by the 
Investigator and made available for inspections by Censa Pharmaceuticals  or designee and by 
regulatory authorities. The original ICF for each participating patient shall be filed with 
records kept by the Investigator, and copies shall be given to the patient . 
Once all data queries and issues have been resolved for each patient the Investig ator will 
electronically sign each patient’s eCRF. This signature will indicate that the data have been 
thoroughly inspected and will thereby certify the contents of the eCRF.  
Clinical data will be entered into a 21 Code of Federal Regulations ( CFR ) Part 1 1-compliant 
electronic data capture system. The data system includes password protection and internal 
quality checks, such as automatic range checks, to identify data that appear inconsistent, 
incomplete, or inaccurate. Clinical data will be entered by the  clinical study site’s research 
staff directly from the source documents.  
10.8 Protocol Violations/Deviations  
A protocol deviation is any noncompliance with the clinical trial protocol  requirements. The 
noncompliance may be either on the part of the patient , the Investigator, or the study site 
staff. Because of  deviations, corrective  actions are to be developed by the site and 
implemented promptly. This is consistent with the following sections in ICH E6:  
• 4.5 Compliance with Protocol, Sections 4.5.1, 4.5.2, and 4.5.3  
• 5.1 Quality Assurance and Quality Control, Section 5.1.1

The Investigator agrees by his/her participation that the results of this study may be used for 
submission for na tional or international registration. If required, national or international 
authorities will be provided with the name of the Investigator and his or her address, full 
disclosure of his or her qualifications, any potential conflicts of interests, payments , and 
extent of involvement.  
During site visits, the clinical monitor will review original patient records, drug 
accountability records, and additional documents as needed. During the course of the study, 
Censa Pharmaceutical ’s (or designee’s ) Quality Assu rance personnel may conduct an on -site 
audit visit. The Investigator will provide direct access to and allow verification and copying 
of all trial -related documents ( e.g., source data ) for trial -related monitoring, audits, IRB 
reviews, and regulatory inspections.  
10.10  Data Generation and Analysis  
Some or all of the obligations of implementing or conducting this study may be transferred 
from Censa Pharmaceuticals to the CRO.  
A case report, comprised of individual eCRFs, will be completed for every patient who signs 
an ICF and is enrolled into the study.  
All original source documentation (laboratory results, treatment records, audit query 
responses, etc.) will be retained by the Investigator or institution unless specified otherwise 
by the protocol. The result s as they become available will be entered on the appropriate 
eCRFs. Legible reproductions of the original laboratory reports for selected tests or variables 
will be submitted to Censa Pharmaceuticals  or CRO as requested.  
The eCRFs will be reviewed by a cl inical monitor who will evaluate the completeness and 
accuracy of the data. Queries will be generated for omissions, corrections, and clarifications. 
Data may also be reviewed in -house by a clinical auditor and data management or other 
personnel.  
Data anal yses will be performed after database lock, when all queries have been resolved.  
10.11  Retention of Data  
Study documents should be retained for a minimum of 2  years after the last approval of a 
marketing application in an ICH region and until there are no pendin g or contemplated 
marketing applications in an ICH region or until at least 2  years have elapsed since the 
formal discontinuation of clinical development of the investigational product. These 
documents should be retained for a longer period, however, if re quired by local regulations. 
No records will be destroyed without the written consent of Censa Pharmaceuticals , if

AMENDMENT 3: 21 Feb 2019 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  PROTOCOL AMENDMENT 3  (FEBRUARY 21, 2019) 
Protocol GAS -001 is amended primarily for the following reasons: 
1. Modified Inclusion Criterion # 2 to increase the upper age limit from 65 to 75 years. 
2. Modified Inclusion Criterion #4 to extend the evidence of gastric emptying to 2 years 
prior to enrol lment and to offer the possibility of retesting during screening with either 
the GES or the GEBT for patients that have historical GES or GEBT greater than 2 years 
prior to enrollment.  Consistent with FDA draft guidance, either GES or GEBT may be used to confirm delayed gastric emptying.  
3. Modified Exclusion Criterion #9 to state the method of QT correction required.  
Fridericia’s correction is being applied to ensure consistency across Censa sponsored clinical studies.  
Major changes to the protocol are as follows: 
Synopsis, Section 4.2 and Appendix 1: Modified exclusion criteria #2 and #4 to increase the 
upper age limit from 65 to 75 and to permit testing for gastric emptying with either the GES 
or the GEBT during screening, respectively. 
Synopsis and Section 4.3: Modified exclusion criterion #9 to clarify that QTc will be 
reported using Fridericia’s correction .

AMENDMENT 3: 21 Feb 2019 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  PROTOCOL AMENDMENT 2  (NOVEMBER 12 , 2018) 
Protocol GAS -001 is amended primarily for the following reasons: 
1. Modified Exclusion Criterion #9 to exclude patients with a marked baseline prolongation 
of QT/QTc interval of ≥470 msec (based on triplicate measurements taken at screening). 
2. Removed reference to Quality of Life measurements using the PAGI -SYM.  
3. Corrected wording of secondary endpoi nts to more accurately reference change resulting 
from CNSA -001 treatment. 
4. Corrected the methods of administration of the nutrient satiety test to 150mL of Ensure 
every 5 minutes. 
 
Major changes to the protocol are as follows: Synopsis and Section 4.3: Modified exclusion criterion #9 to QTc ≥470 msec. Synopsis and Section 2.2: Corrected wording of secondary endpoints to reflect an effect of 
CNSA-001 treatment.  Corrected the usage of PAGI- SYM as a symptom scale versus a 
quality of life scale.

CONFIDENTIAL  The test product is CNSA -001 (sepiapterin) oral powder for suspension. CNSA -001 will be 
suspended in Medisca® Oral Mix prior to dispensing to the patient. Patients randomized to receive 
CNSA -001 will receive  CNSA -001 20 mg/kg/day  (i.e., 10 mg/kg BID) for 14 days. 
Reference Therapy; Dose; and Mode of Administration:  
The reference product is placebo. The placebo is a ready -made suspension containing 
microcrystalline cellulose, colloidal silicon dioxide, croscarmellose, ascorbic acid, and colorant 
(Yellow No. 6) that is suspended in Medisca® Oral Mix.  
Duration of Treatment:  
Patients will be treated for a total of 14 days.  
Criteria for Evaluation:  
Safety:  
Safety and tolerability of CNSA -001 as measured by severity and number of treatment- emergent 
adverse events (TEAEs), including assessment of severity of TEAEs, and changes in clinical 
laboratory  and HbA1c  tests, vital signs, and physical examination s 
Efficacy:  
The primary efficacy measure will be the  change in maximal tolerated volume consumed during 
the nutrient satiety test from Day 1  to Day  14 and Day 1  to Day  28. 
Secondary efficacy measures will consist of changes in the following from baseline to  Day  14 and 
baseline to Day 28 (± 1 day):  
• GCSI  (Section  6.8, Appendix 2) PAGI -SYM  (Section 6.9, Appendix 2 ) subscale 
(heartburn/regurgitation, fullness/early satiety, nausea/vomiting, bloating, upper abdominal 
pain, and lower abdominal  pain) scores 
• Gastric emptying as measured by the GEBT  
Statistical Methods:  
The following study populations will be analyzed: 
• Safety population: all patients who were randomized and received any amount of study drug (CNSA-001 or placebo) 
• Efficacy population: all patients who were randomized, received any amount of study drug 
(CNSA -001 or placebo), and had available Day  1 and Day  14 nutrient satiety test 
maximum tolerated volume results  
Safety will be assessed in the Safety population. Adverse events ( AEs) will be coded using the 
Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA®). The number and percentage of patients 
with TEAEs will be tabulated by system organ class, preferred term, and treatment group . Severity 
of AEs and serious adverse events ( SAE s) will be summarized similarly . Those AEs leading to 
premature discontinuation from the study drug and the serious TEAEs will be presented in a table or a listing. Clinical laboratory and HbA1c  test results and vital signs will be summarized at each 
visit as will changes from baseline for each treatment group.  A frequency distribution of abnormal 
physical examination results will be provided. 
Efficacy will be assessed in the Efficacy population. The changes from Day 1 to Day 14 and from 
Day 1 to Day 28 in maximal tolerated volume consumed during the nutrient satiety test will be 
compared between treatment groups using a student’s t- test. Results from the nutrient satiety test 
through Day 14 and Day 28, the GEBT through Day 15 and Day 27 or Day 29, and the G CSI 
(Section  6.8, Appendix 2) and PAGI -SYM  (Section 6.9 , Appendix 2
) through Day  14 (+1) and 
through Day  28 (± 1) will be summarized using summary statistics (number of patients, mean, 
standard deviation, median, and ra nge) at each visit as well as changes from baseline within each 
treatment group. The 95% confidence intervals for the changes from baseline  will be provided. 
Additional analyses may be conducted, and details will be provided in the statistical analysis pla n.

CONFIDENTIAL  1 INTRODUCTION 
1.1 Diabetic Gastroparesis   
Gastroparesis is characterized by delay ed gastric emptying in the absence of mechanical 
obstruction; symptoms are chronic with episodic symptom exacerbation ( Parkman et al,  
2004).  Gastroparesis affects women 4 times more than men (Soykan, et al, 1998).  Idiopathic 
gastroparesis accounts for most cases , but gastroparesis is frequently associated with diabetes 
(diabetic gastroparesis)  (Soykan, et al,  1998; Karamanolis  et al, 2007). Several 
cross -sectional studies have found delayed gastric emptying of solids and/or liquids in 30% 
to 50% of patients wi th Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes ( Horowitz et al, 2002). Patients with 
diabetes mellitus commonly experience gastric and intestinal dysfunction  (Feldman and 
Schiller, 1983).  
The actual mechanism of diabetic gastroparesis is not well known. Vagal nerve dysfunction 
and/or damage, interstitial cells of Cajal loss, and smooth muscle and enteric neuron 
dysfunction have all been implicated in the pathogenesis of diabetic gastroparesis ( Stacher , 
2001; Parkman  et al,  2004). In addition, acute hyperglycemia has the potential to slow gastric 
emptying ( Camilleri et al , 2013).  
At a molecular level,  attention has been devoted to the potential role of altered nitrergic 
signaling in the enteric nervous system. Gastric motility is regulated in large part by neurons 
of the enteric nervous system  located in the muscle wall ( Wood et al, 1999). These neurons 
are either excitatory (releasing acetylcholine) or inhibitory (releasing nitric oxide [NO] and 
vasoactive intestinal peptide). Nerves throughout the luminal gas trointestinal (GI) tract 
express neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), which generates NO, a key neurotransmitter in the regulatio n of GI motility ( Takahashi, 2003) ; it is the principal non adrenergic 
noncholinergic inhibitory neurotransmitter in the GI tract . In diabetic rats , which serve as a 
model for type 1 diabetes, nNOS expression was found to be impaired. This impairment in nNOS messenger RNA  expression was associated with impaired smooth muscle relaxation in 
response to electrical stimulation of circular muscle fibers obtained from the proximal stomach of these rats ( Takahashi et al, 1997).  It has been demonstrated that female diabetic 
rats had slower gastric emptying than age matched diabetic male rats , female control rats had 
greater nitrergic relaxation of circular antral muscle strips compared to male controls , and 
nitrergic relaxation was impaired in diabetic female rats but not matched diabetic male rats  
(Gangula et al, 2007). 
The core signs and symptoms of gastroparesis by incidence are nausea (92 % to 96% ), 
vomiting (68% to 88%), postprandial fullness (54% to 77% ), early satiety (42 % to 60%), and 
upper abdominal pain (36% to 85% ) (Soykan et al,  1998; Hoogerwerf  et al , 1999; Anaparthy 
et al, 2009). Patients may experience any combination of signs and symptoms with varying 
degrees of s everity. Pain is less p revalent  in diabetic gastroparesis  than  idiopathic 
gastroparesis. Patients with diabetic  gastroparesis may experience further derangement of 
glucose cont rol because of unpredictable gastric emptying and altered absorption of orally 
administered hypoglycemic drugs, which may , in turn , affect measurement of core signs and 
symptoms. Severe signs and symptoms may cause complications such as malnutrition,

CONFIDENTIAL  esophagitis, and Mallory -Weiss tears. Gastroparesis  adversely affects the lives of patients 
with the disease, resulting in d ecreased social interaction, poor work functionality, and 
development of anxiety or depression ( Soykan et al, 1998; Parkman et al , 2004).  
1.2 Impaired Gastric Accommodation  in Gastroparesis  
Patients with diabetic gastroparesis have also been shown to have gastric hypersensitivity, 
especially in the postprandial state, and impairment of the postprandial accommodation 
response. ( Kumar et al, 2008).  The stomach functions as 2 separate regions: the fundus acts 
as a reservoir accommodating a meal without a significant increase in intragastric pressure, and the distal stomach/antrum triturates gastric contents. Receptive relaxation or 
accommodation is vagally mediated result ing in the release of NO and activation of nitrergic 
myenteric neurons. Nitrergic signaling is responsible for gastric accommodation and pyloric relaxation in response to a meal  (Ishiguchi et al, 2001).  
Impaired accommodation has been associated with symptoms of early satiety and weight loss in patients with idiopathic gastroparesis ( Karamanolis et al, 2007). A study of patients with 
diabetic gastroparesis found that 90% of patients had impaired gastric accommodation to a nutrient meal ( Kumar et al, 2008). In the distal stomach, NO is required for the propulsive 
contractions that tr iturate gastric contents and control of pyloric closure;  lack of NO can lead 
to delayed gastric emptying and impaired gastric accommodation  (Gangula et al, 2007). 
Several co -factors are known to be important for nNOS activity, including nicotinamide 
adenine dinucleotide phosphate hydrogen ( NADPH) , calcium , and tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) 
(Werner et al, 2003).  The homodimeric conformation of all 3 isoforms of nitric oxide 
synthase (NOS ) is regulated by BH4  (Werner et al, 2003). In the absence of BH4, uncoupling 
of NO production occurs and leads to super oxide production, resulting in further impaired nNOS bioactivity. 
1.3 Current Treatment of Diabetic Gastroparesis  
Therapies  for gastroparesis have been targeted at accelerating gastric emptying or controlling 
symptoms . Available therapies for accelerating gastric emptying are limited in number and 
efficacy . These include metoclopramide  (Snape et al , 1982), erythromycin ( Arts et al, 2005), 
and domperidone (not available in the U nited States  [US] ) (Prakash  and Wagstaff, 1998). 
There is also poor correlation between gastric emptying and baseline symptom severity 
(Karamanolis et al, 2007; Talley et al, 2001) and in response to therapeutic intervention. In 
part, as a result of lack of understanding of the underlying pathogenes is that leads to 
alterations in GI motility and sensation , medical therapies have not been targeted at the 
underlying pathophysiology of gastroparesis.  
The first -line medical therapy for patients with diabetic gastroparesis  is generally a 
combination of a n antiemetic agent in addition to the promotility drug. Unfortunately, many 
patients with diabetic gastroparesis  will not experience adequate symptom relief despite 
first-line therapy. For patients with refractory disease, options include combination proki netic 
therapy, psychotropic medications, pyloric botulinum toxin injection, and gastric electric 
stimulation  (Fass, 2010; Camilleri et al , 2013).

CONFIDENTIAL  1.4 CNSA-001 ( Sepiapterin ) 
Sepiapterin  is 2-amino -6-[(2S)-2-hydroxypropanoyl]-7,8-dihydro-1H-pteridin-4-one with a 
molecular weight of 237.2 and a molecular formula of C 9H11 N5O3. 
The chemical structure of sepiapterin  is: 
 
Sepiapterin serves as a substrate for BH 4 synthesis via the pterin salvage pathway ( Mayer  
and Werner , 1995 ). Oral administration of sepiapterin was shown to be more potent (>2 fold) 
than oral administration of BH4 in increasing intracellular BH 4 in normal mice  (Sawabe et 
al, 2002).  Translation of this finding to humans has been confirmed in a Phase 1 study, 
PKU-001, conducted by Censa Pharmaceuticals .  
1.5 Rationale for Study 
BH4 biosynthesis is impaired in chronic diabetes. The mechanism of impairment is not well 
understood but is thought to be a result of  hyperglycemia -induced protea some -mediated 
degradation of GTP- cyclohydrolase, the rate- limiting enzyme in the synthesis pathway for 
BH4  (Xu et al, 2007).  
CNSA-001 is  the first viable formulation of sepiapterin , shown to increase intracellular BH4 
(Section 1.4), intended for the treatment of female patients with diabetic gastrop aresis . 
CNSA-001 was studied in a single and multiple ascending -dose study in healthy volunteers, 
the Phase 1 study, Study PKU -001. Part A of t his study assessed the safety and 
pharmacokinetics of CNSA -001 at 6 dose levels inclusive of an assessment of food effect 
(i.e., 2.5 mg/kg, 7.5 mg/kg, 20 mg/kg, 40 mg/kg, 80 mg/kg, and 10 mg/kg [to assess food effect]). Additionally, Kuvan
® (sapropterin dihydrochloride), a synthetic BH4 commercially 
available product , was administered at equivalent doses for the firs t 3 dose levels (2.5 mg/kg, 
7.5 mg/kg , and 20 mg/kg). Dose- dependent correlations between CNSA -001 and plasma 
BH4 concentrations were observed with each successive dose level. Dose proportionality was observed between the top 2 dose levels (40 mg/kg and 80 mg/kg) and resultant BH4 concentrations. Administration with a standard high- fat (approximately 50 percent of total 
caloric content of the meal) and high calorie (approximately 800 to 1000 calories) meal resulted in approximately 80% higher plasma BH4 concentrations (a rea under the 
concentration time curve from 0 to the last measurement  [AUC
0-last] and  maximum 
concentration  [C max]) than in subjects who had fasted before receipt of CNSA -001. 
Treatment -emergent adverse events (TE AEs) in Part A of Study PKU -001 were reported in 
26 subjects  (44.1%, 26/59). The TEAEs for CNSA -001 were generally mild and consistent 
with reported adverse events (AEs) for Kuvan® and placebo. The frequency of TEAEs did

study treatment were reported in 17 subjects : 11 subjects  (26.2%, 11/42) who received  
CNSA-001, 4 subjects (44.4%, 4/9) who received Kuvan®, and 2 subjects  (25.0%, 2/8) who 
received placebo. No TEAEs were severe or serious or led to discontinuation of study drug. 
Headache and dizziness were the most common TEAEs , but these TEAEs occurred at a 
similar frequency as with placebo.  
Part B of Study PKU -001 assessed  multiple  ascending  dose s CNSA-001 in healt hy 
volunteers. Data indicate CNSA -001 was well tolerated following daily doses of 5, 20, and 
60 mg/kg/day for 7 days and that TEAEs were reported in 14 subjects (58.3%, 14/24). The 
TEAEs in subjects who received CNSA 001 were mild or moderate and co nsisten t with the 
TEAEs  in subjects who received placebo: T EAEs were experienced by 10 subjects (55.6%, 
10/18) who received  CNSA -001 at doses from  5 mg/kg to 60 mg/kg daily for 7 days and by 
4 subjects (66.7%, 4/6) who received placebo. No TEAEs were severe, seri ous, or led to 
discontinuation. Of the 10 TEAEs reported in subjects who received  CNSA -001, only 4 were 
judged to be related  to study drug , and, of the 4 TEAEs reported in subjects who received  
placebo , only 1 was judged to be related to study drug. Somnolence, fatigue, headache, and 
procedural pain (secondary to performance of 2 sequential lumbar punctures 7 days a part) 
were the most common TEAEs reported, and they occurred at a similar frequency when 
compared with placebo with the exception of fati gue and headach e, which were each 
reported in 2 subjects who received CNSA -001 (11.1%, 2/18). 
This Phase 2 pilot study will assess CNSA-001 doses of 20 mg/kg /day administered as 
10 mg/kg  twice a day ( BID) in comparison to placebo administered BID in female patients 
with diabetic gastroparesis . This study will help support the design of future Phase 2/3

3.2 Rationale for Study Design and Control Group 
CNSA-001 (sepiapterin) is a new chemical entity that is an endogenous, naturally occurring 
precursor of BH 4 via the pterin salvage pathway . Animal studies and data from a Phase 1 
single and multiple ascending -dose study in healthy volunteers conducted by Censa 
Pharmaceuticals  indicat e rapid intracellular conversion of sepiapterin to BH4. It is expected 
that oral administration of CNSA -001 to women with diabetic gastroparesis will result in 
increases in both intracellular and circulating BH 4 concentrations. In chronic diabetes, BH4 
biosynthesis is impaired ( Xu et al, 2007).  
CNSA-001 was studied in two 14-day Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) toxicity studies, as described in Section 5.3, and in a single and multiple ascending -dose study in healthy 
volunteers, Study PKU-001, as described in Section 1.5.  
Because all patients will receive the standard of care for diabetic gastroparesis  in addition to 
their assigned study drug, the study design of a randomized study of CNSA-001 versus 

CNSA -001 (sepiapterin)                                                                                                        Censa Pharmaceuticals

CONFIDENTIAL  5 STUDY TREATMENTS  
5.1 Description of Treatments  
5.1.1 Test Product  
The test product is CNSA-001 (sepiapterin) oral powder for suspension. CNSA-001 contains 
the new chemical entity, sepiapterin. Sepiapterin  is 2-amino -6-[(2S)-2-hydroxypropanoyl]-
7,8-dihydro-1H- pteridin -4-one with a molecular weight of 237.2 and a molecular formula of 
C9H11 N5O3. Inactive ingredients in CNSA-001 include microcrystalline cellulose, colloidal 
silicon dioxide, croscarmellose, and ascorbic acid. CNSA-001 will be suspended in Medisca® 
Oral Mix prior to dispensing it to the patient.  
5.1.2 Placebo  Control 
The placebo is a ready -made suspension containing microcrystalline cellulose, colloidal 
silicon dioxide, croscarmellose, ascorbic acid , and colorant (Yellow No. 6) that is suspended 
in Medisca® Oral Mix.   
5.2 Treatments Administered  
Patients will be randomized in a ratio of 1:1  to the following treatment groups :  
• CNSA-001 20 mg/kg/day  (10 mg/kg BID) for 14 days 
• Placebo BID for 14 days 
Dosing of CNSA-001 is  based on the patient’s weight . The weight obtained on Day  -1 will 
be used to calculate the exact amount ( mg) of CNSA -001 active ingredient  (sepiapterin ) 
required for each patient’s daily dose.  
The placebo  is formulated as ready -made suspension. The placebo will be administered in the 
same manner (volume) as CNSA-001. 
Details on preparation of study drug and dosing guidelines will be provided in a pharmacy manual for the site and an instruction guide for patients .  
5.3 Selection and Timing  of Dose for Each Patient  
All patients will be randomly assigned in a ratio of 1:1 to receive CNSA-001 20 mg/kg/day  
(10 mg/kg  BID)  or placebo BID .  
The CNSA-001 dose w as selected following completion of two 14 -day GLP  toxicity studies 
in the rat and marmoset. The no observed adverse effect level  from both studies was set at 
1000 mg/kg/day, which represents a human equivalent dose of 161.3 mg/kg/da y based on 
allometric scaling. Consequently, the proposed dose of 20 mg/kg/day represents a n 8.1-fold 
safety margin.

CONFIDENTIAL  Study drug will be dispensed on Day  1 (Section  6.11) with a dosing diary in which patient s 
will record all doses taken and times they were taken  (Section  5.8.1). The first dose on Day  1 
will be taken in the clinic  after patient s undergo the nutrient satiety test ( Section 6.7). 
If a patient vomits after taking a dose of study drug, the patient should wai t until the next 
scheduled timepoint to take another dose. A missed dose should be taken as soon as possible, 
but >2 doses should not be taken on the same day. 
5.4 Method of Assigning Patients  to Treatment Groups  
Patients who fulfill the eligibility criteria  and provide informed consent will be randomized 
in a ratio of 1:1  to the CNSA-001 or placeb o group  via the randomization scheme generated 
for the study. Patients who are randomized will be considered to be enrolled.  5.5 Blinding  
This study has a double-blind design. The Investigator , study personnel, and patient s will not 
make any effort to determine which study drug is being received.  Unblinded pharmacy (or 
other qualified site ) personnel will be utilized in this study to prepare the study drug. 
Patients will be blinded to study drug assignment. Only in an emergency, when knowledge of 
the study drug is essential for the clinic al management or welfare of a specific patient , may 
the Investigator unblind a patient’s study drug assignment. Copies of the randomization sequence and treatment codes will  be kept in the pharmacy at the sites . If emergency 
unblinding is required, the Investigator will have immediate access to individual sealed  codes 
containing treatment allocation s. However , before any unblinding occurs, the Investigator is 
strongly advised to discuss options with the Sponsor’s Medical Monitor or appropriate 
Sponsor study personnel. As soon as possible and without revealing the patient ’s study drug

6.7 Nutrient Satiety Test  
For t he nutrient satiety test, patients  consum e 150 mL of Ensure ™ every 5 minutes. At 
5-minute intervals, patien ts score their fullness using a rating scale that combines verbal 
descriptors on a scale graded 0  to 5 (0: no symptoms, 1: first sensation of fullness [threshold], 
2: mild, 3: moderate, 4: severe and 5: maximum or unbearable fullness). Patients are  told to 
stop when a score of 5 is obtained. The actual volume of Ensure™ consumed at this point is 
the maximum tolerated volume. Symptoms are measured 30 minutes after comple ting the test 
with pat ients scoring each symptom of bloating, fullness, nausea and pain on a visual 
analogue scale with 100 -mm lines and the words “unnoticeable” and “unbearable” as 
anch ors. The sum of the four 100- mm visual analogue scales provides an agg regate symptom 
score ( Park, 2011). 
The nutrient satiety test will be administered in the clinic at Screening, on Day 1 (predose), 
and on Day  14 and Day 28 after overnight fasts and after any medications that  can alter GI 
sensati on or accommodation or gastric emptying have been held overnight. A nutrient satiety 
test volume of ≤600 mL at Screening is required for patients to participate in this study. 
6.8 Gastroparesis Cardinal Symptom Index  
The GCSI  (Appendix 2) consisting of a subset of items from the PAGI- SYM  instrument 
(Section 6.9, Appendix 2) , will be administer ed in the clinic at Screening  and on Day  1 
(predose), Day  14 (+1 day) , and Day  28 (±1 day) . A GCSI score >21  at Screening , indicating 
moderate to severe symptoms, is required for patient s to participate in this study.  
6.9 Patient Assessment of Upper Gastrointestinal Disorders -Symptom 
Severity  
The PAGI -SYM  (Appendix 2 ) is a 20-item upper GI  symptom severity instrument with 
6 subscales: heartburn/regurgitation, fullness/early satiety, nausea/vomiting, bloating, upper 
abdominal pain, and lower abdominal pain. It will be administered in the clinic on Day  1 
(predose) and on Day  14 (+1 day) , and Day 28 (± 1 day).  
6.10 Gastric Emptying Breath Test  
The GEBT, which is a nonradioactive noninvasive test, will be administered in the clinic on 
Day -1, Day  15, and Day 27 or Day  29 after the patient has fasted overnight  (a minimum of 
8 hours before test administration  with the exception of 4 ounces of water up to 1 hour before 
the test ). At the clinic , the patie nt provides baseline (premeal) breath samples and then 
consumes a standardized 230 kCal meal, consisting of a proprietary standardized 13C-labeled 
egg component (which is rehydrated and then microwaved for 1.5 minutes) and 6 saltine 
crackers , accompanied by 6 ounces of water. The  meal is to be consumed within 10 minutes. 
Single postmeal breath samples are collected in capped glass tubes at 45, 90, 120, 150, 180, 
and 240 minutes after the meal is consumed and sent to the specified local laboratory for

CONFIDENTIAL  analysis  by Gas Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometry . By adding 13C to the test meal, the GEBT 
can determine how fast the stomach empties the meal by measuring the rate of carbon-13 
dioxide (13CO 2) excretion arising from the digested test meal. The rate of 13CO 2 excretion 
found in the patient’s breath is proportional to the patient’s rate of gastric emptying. The 
patient’s 13CO 2 excretion rate at each breath collection time is reported using the GEBT 
metric “kPCD.” The “k” is a multiplier of 1000, and “PCD” is an acronym for percent 13C 
dose excreted (as 13CO 2). The test should not be administered to patient s with a known 
allergy to egg, wheat, or algae ( Spirulina) ( Cairn Diagnostics ™; Sutton et al , 2015; GEBT  
package insert, 2015; United States Food and Drug Administration, 2015).  
6.11 Dispensing Study Drug   
Study drug will be dispensed on Day  1 along with a dosing diary to record all doses taken 
and time s they were taken.  A sufficient supply of study drug will be dispensed for dosing 
through Day  14. Details on the preparation of study drug , dosing guidelines , and storage will 
be provided in a pharmacy manual for the site and an instruction guide for patients . 
6.12 Adverse Events Assessments  
An AE  is defined as any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of an 
intervention in humans, whether or not considered intervention- related.  
The occurrence of an AE or serious adverse event ( SAE ) (Section 6.12.6) may come to the 
attention of study personnel during study visits and interviews of a study patient presenting 
for medical care, or upon review by a study monitor. All AEs including local and systemic reactions not meeting the criteria for SAEs will be captured on the appropriate e CRF. 
Information to be collected includes, but is  not limited to, the  event description, time of 
onset, clinician’s assessment of severity, relationship to study dru g (assessed only by those 
with the training and authority to make a diagnosis), and date of resolution/stabilization of 
the event. Action taken regarding study medication (e.g., drug withdrawn, interrupted) will 
also be collected in the eCRF. All AEs that start during the study must be documented 
appropriately regardless of relationship. All treatment -related AEs or AEs leading to 
discontinuation will be followed to an adequate resolution, as determined by the Investigator. 
Any medical condition that is pre sent at the time that the patient is screened  will be 
considered as medical history  and not reported as an AE. However, if the patient’s condition 
deteriorates at any time during the study, it will be recorded as an AE.  
Changes in the severity of an AE will be documented to allow an assessment of the duration of the event at each level of severity to be performed. The AEs characterized as intermittent 
require documentation of onset and duration of each episode. 
6.12.1 Reporting Timelines  
The Investigator will record all reportable events  with start dates occurring any time after 
informed consent and continue through clinical study completion or, in the case of 
withdrawal, until the outcome is determined. The AEs will be  assessed a t each v isit and/or

information can be obta ined. 
All SAEs and pregnancies (in a patient or partner of a male patient) occurring while the 
patient is on the study or within 30 (± 3) days after the patient received the last dose of study 
drug must be reported within 24 hours of the knowledge of the event by study personnel 
whether or not considered to be related to study drug. 
Death s that occur ≥30 (± 3) days after the patient’s last st udy dose must be reported within 
24 hours of knowledge of the event, if deemed related to study drug by the Investigator.  
Although pregnancy is not considered an AE or SAE by regulatory definition, for this study 
pregnancies must be processed following SAE  timelines (e.g., within 24 hours of knowledge 
of the pregnancy) for data transmission purposes. In the event that a pregnancy complication 
occurs , or elective termination of a pregnancy is required for medical reasons, then the 
complication will be record ed as an AE or SAE , as appropriate.  
While elective and uncomplicated induced abortion not required for medical reasons does not constitute an AE  or SAE (even if the patient  or patient’ s partner is hospitalized to undergo 
abortion), spontaneous abortion is considered a fatal event and must be reported as an AE 
and SAE, as appropriate.  
Any pregnancy and/or suspected pregnancy that occurs during the study in a female patient should be reported using Pregnancy Reporting Form within 24 hours of knowledge of the event by study personnel. Any pregnancy and/or suspected pregnancy will be followed for outcome. 
If the patient has received the investigational drug prior to becoming pregnant, the patien t 
will continue the efficacy assessment and Follow-up periods and measures of safety and 
efficacy will be obtained.  
The patient will be  followed until the outcome of the pregnancy is determined. I t is the 
responsibility of the Inve stigator to obtain and document pregnancy information on the most 
recent Pregnancy Report Form. Fur thermore, any S AE o ccurrin g as an outco me of the

CONFIDENTIAL  6.12.2 Severity  
The intensity of each AE will be graded as follows:  
Mild:  Events require minimal or no treatment and do not interfere with the 
patient’s daily activities.  
Moderate:  Events result in a low level of inconvenience or concern with the therapeutic 
measures. Moderate events may cause some interference with functioning .  
Severe:  Events interrupt a patient’s usual daily activity and may require systemic 
drug therapy or other treatment. Severe events are usually potentially 
life-threatening or incapacitating.  
 
It is important to distinguish between serious and severe AEs. Severity is a measure of 
intensity; however, an AE of severe intensity need not necessarily be considered serious. For 
example, nausea that  persists for several hours may be considered severe nausea but may not 
be considered an SAE. Alternatively, a stroke that  results in only a limited degree of 
disability may be considered only a mild stroke but would be considered an SAE. 
6.12.3 Relationship  
The Investigator’s assessment of causality must be provided for all AEs (serious and 
nonserious). An Investigator’s causality assessment is the determination of whether there exists a reasonable possibility that the study drug caused or contributed to an AE. For purposes of consistency, guidelines for assessing c ausality are provided  below: 
CNSA -001 (sepiapterin)                                                                                                        Censa Pharmaceuticals

AMENDMENT 3: 21 Feb 2019 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Not Related  The AE is completely independent of study drug administration, and/or 
evidence exists that the event is definitely related to another etiology. There 
must be an alternative,  definitive etiolo gy documented by the cli nician.  
No relationship between the experience and the administration of study 
drug; related to other etiologies such as concomitant medications or 
patient’s clinical state.  
Unlikely  to be 
Related  A clinical event, including an abnormal laboratory test result, whose  
temporal relationship to drug administration makes a causal relationship improbable (e.g., the event did not occur within a reasonable time after administration of the trial medication) and in  
which other drugs or chemicals 
or underlying disease provides plausible explanations (e.g., the patient’s 
clinical condition, other concomitant treatments).  
Possibl y 
Related  There is some evidence to suggest a causal relationship (e.g., the event 
occurred within a reasonable time after administration of  the trial 
medication). However, other factors may have contributed to the event (e.g.,  the patient’s clinical condition, other concomitant events). Although 
an AE may rate only as “possibly related” soon after discovery, it can be flagged as requiring more information and later be upgraded to “probably 
related” or  “definitely related,” as appropriate.  
Probabl y 
Related  There is evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and the influence of other 
factors is unlikely. The clinical event, including an abnorm al laboratory test 
result, occurs within a reasonable time after administration of the drug, is unlikely to be attributed to concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals, and follows a clinically reasonable response on withdrawal (dechallenge). 
Rechallen ge information is not required to fulfill this definition .  
Definite ly 
Related  There is clear evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and other possible 
contributing factors can be ruled out. The clinical event, including an abnormal laboratory test result, occurs in a plausible time relationship to drug administration and cannot be explained by concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals. The response to withdrawal of the drug (dechallenge) should be clinically plausible. The event must be pharmacol ogically or 
phenomenologically definitive, with use of a satisfactory rechallenge 
procedure if necessary .  
 
These criteria, in addition to good clinical judgment, should be used as a guide for 
determining the causal assessment. If the event is believed to  be unrelated to study drug 
administration, then an alternative explanation should be provided, if available . 
6.12.4 Expectedness  
An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered “ unexpected ” if it is not listed in the 
Investigators’ Brochure or is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed; 
CNSA -001 (sepiapterin)                                                                                                        Censa Pharmaceuticals

AMENDMENT 3: 21 Feb 2019 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  or, if an Investigators’ Brochure is not required or available, is not consistent with the risk 
information described in the general investigational plan or elsewhere in the protocol. 
The drug safety medical reviewer will be responsible for determining whether an AE is 
expected or unexpected. An AE will be considered unexpected if the nature, severity, or frequency of the event is not consistent with the risk information previously described for the study agent ( e.g., Investigators’ Brochure). 
6.12.5 Clinical Laboratory Adverse Events  
Laboratory abnormalities should not be recorded as AEs or SAEs unless they are associated with clinical signs or symptoms or require medical intervention, as determined by the 
Investigator. However, each laboratory abnormality ( e.g., clinically significant changes 
detected in hematology, serum chemistry panel , urinalysis, urine microscopic, and HbA1c  
evaluations) independent from any underlying medical condition that requires medical or surgical intervention, or that leads to study drug interruption or discontinuation, must be recorded as an AE, or SAE if applicable. If the laboratory abnormality is part of a clini cal 
condition or syndrome, it should be recorded as the syndrome or diagnosis rather than as the individual laboratory abnormality. In addition, laboratory abnormalities or other abnormal test assessments ( e.g., vital signs ) performed that are associated w ith signs or symptoms must 
be recorded as AEs or SAEs if they meet the definition of an AE (or SAE) as described below. 
6.12.6 Serious Adverse Events  
6.12.6.1 Definition  
An SAE is defined as an AE or suspected adverse reaction  occurring at any dose that results 
in any of the following outcomes: death, life -threatening AE, inpatient  hospitalization or 
prolongation of existing hospitalization, a persistent or significant disability/incapacity or a 
substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect. 
An AE  or suspected adverse reaction is considered ‘‘life- threatening’’ if, in the view of either 
the Investigator or Sponsor, its occurrence places the patient at immediate risk of death. It 
does not include an AE  or suspected adverse reaction that, had it occurred in a more severe 
form, might have caused death. 
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospitalization may be considered an SAE when, based upon appropriat e medical judgment, 
they may jeopardize the patient and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 
one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such medical events include 
allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an  emergency room or at home, blood 
dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. Medical and scientific judg ment  should be exercised in 
deciding whether expedited reporting is appropriate in these other situations.

AMENDMENT 3: 21 Feb 2019 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  6.12.6.2 Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction (SUSAR)  
The Sponsor must submit a safety report for any suspected adverse reaction to study 
treatment that is both serious and unexpected. Before submitting a safety report, the Sponsor 
needs to ensure that the event meets all 3 of the definitions: 
• Suspected adverse reaction  
• Serious 
• Unexpected  
If the AE does not meet all 3 of the definitions, it should not be submitted as a safety report. 
6.12.6.3 Reporting Serious Adverse Events  
The Investigator will report all SAEs to the designated drug safety team within 24 hours of 
knowledge of the event whe ther or not consider ed to be re lated to study drug using the SAE 
Report Form provided. 
Although not all information required for a complete SAE Report Form may be readily 
available at the time of the event, the Investigator must include sufficient information on the SAE Report Form to allow for a complete medical assessment. This should incl ude at a 
minimum the patient number, site number, detailed description of the event, seriousness 
criteria, causality/relationship to study drug , and I nvestigator signature . 
The designated drug safety team will acknowledge the receipt of the SAE via email to the 
clinical site. After submission of the initial report, the Investigator will provide follow -up 
information to the drug safety team as requested (e.g., concomitant medications, hospital 
discharge summary) to further evaluate the event and assure that all appropriate information 
is received. Once all information is received and the SAE has been deemed appropriate for closure, the SAE Report Form must be signed and dated by the Investigator. 
The Inve stigator is responsible for in forming  the Institutional Review Board ( IRB) of the 
SAE in accordance with institution al policie s and procedure s including re levant initia l and 
follow-up information about the S AE. 
Treatment -related SAEs or events leading to discontinuation of study drug will be followed 
for outcome information until resolution or stabilization. Other supporting documentation of 
the event may be requested by Censa Pharmaceuticals (or designee) and should be provided 
as soon as possible. The Medical Monitor should be contacted when the Investigator considers an SAE to be treatment -related.  
6.12.7 Treatment -Emergent Adverse Events  
Those AEs that start at the time of or after the first dose of study drug  are TEAEs . Those AEs 
that worsen at or after the time of first dose of study dru g are also considered 
treatment -emergent. All AEs that occur on or after the ICF has been signed, including all 
TEAE s, through Day  29 will be recorded in the eCRF.

AMENDMENT 3: 21 Feb 2019 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  All SAEs through Day 44 ±3 days [30 ±3 days after the patient received last dose of study 
drug] will be recorded in the eCRF and reported as described in Section 6.12.6.3. 
6.13 Prior and Concomitant Medication Assessments  
All prescription and over-the-counter medications (including herbal medications) taken by a 
patient starting from the 30 -day period before Screening through Day  28 (±1 day ) before the 
patient leaves the clinic after completion of all EOS evaluations will be recorded. Any 
concomitant medications added or discontinued during the study will be recorded at each visit.  
6.14 Removal of Patients  From the Trial or Study Drug  
6.14.1 Early Disco ntinuation From Study Drug Administration  
Premature discontinuation of study drug administration is defined as the discontinuation of study drug for an individual patient before the required full course of study drug is 
completed.  Reasons for premature dis continuation from study drug administration should be 
recorded on the appropriate page(s) of the eCRF and may include, but are not limited to the following: 
• Occurrence of an AE, SAE,  or clinically significant laboratory abnormality that, in the 
opinion of the Investigator, warrants the patient’s permanent discontinuation from study 
drug administration  
• In the judgment of the Investigator, the patient experiences a general or specific 
change(s) that renders the patient unsuitable for continued study drug administration  
• There is a need for concomitant medication that makes the patient ineligible for further 
study drug administration  
• Pregnancy  
• Specific reasons related  to adverse events that have been observed in pre- and post-
marketing treatment with the same drug class of CNSA -001 (i.e., sapropterin): 
o Hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis  
o Gastritis  
o Abnormal liver function tests in patients with liver impairment  
o Unexplained hyperactivity  
Given the requirement for pregnancy testing in women of childbearing potential at Screening 
and the requirement for highly effective methods of contraception during the study, it is 
unlikely that pregnancies will occur during study conduct. However, study drug will be 
discontinued should suspected or confirmed pregnancy or nursing during the study drug administration period occur.

AMENDMENT 3: 21 Feb 2019 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Patients who prematurely discontinue study drug due to any of the above reasons will 
complete the EOT  assessments  within  24 hours of withdrawal.  
6.14.2 Withdrawal F rom the Study  
Patients may w ithdraw from the study for any reason or be withdrawn at the request of the 
Investigator or Sponsor. The reason for a patient ’s withdrawal must be recorded on the 
appropriate page(s) of the eCRF. Reasons for withdrawal from the study may include, but are 
not limited to:  
• Withdrawal of consent  
• AEs or SAEs  
• Significant patient  noncompliance, defined as refusal or inability to adhere to the protocol 
requirements  
• The Investigator determines that it is in the best interest of the patient to withdraw from 
study participation, due to a reason other than safety 
Each patient who withdraws from the study after receipt of any amount of study drug will be 
asked to undergo EOT  assessments. However, patients may withdraw consent to participate 
in this study at any time w ithout penalty. Withdrawn patients  who receive any amount  of 
study drug, will not be replaced.  Withdrawn patients who do not receive any study drug will 
be replaced.  
6.14.3 Study Stopping Criteria  
The study may be terminated if significant violations of Good Clinical Practice ( GCP ) that 
compromise the ability to achieve the study objectives or compromise patient  safety are 
observed at any time during the study. With regard to safety, the study may be temporarily suspended or terminated should the Investigator, Sponsor, or IRB determine that the safety of 
patients  is significantly jeopardized. The decision for a temporary or permanent study hold 
will depend on the nature, frequency, and severity of AEs that were observed in all enrolled patients to date. For example, the study will be temporarily or permanently halted should 
either of the following occur: 
• The presence of the same system organ class (e,g., gastrointestinal, cardiac, etc. ) 
severe AE for which no other alternative etiology can be identified, considered related to study drug, in 2 or more patients (Severity defined in Section 6.12.2). 
• The presence of life-threatening AE or AE requiring urgent intervention in 1 or more patients.  
• Death related to Adverse Event.

CONFIDENTIAL  In a temporary study hold, no additional patients will be enrolled into the study or dosed with 
study drug until the study team members (including the Investigator and the Medical 
Monitor) decide it is safe to proceed with the study. 
  6.15 Appropriateness of Measurements  
Safety will be measured by AEs (including SAEs), vital signs, physical examinations, and 
clinical laboratory and HbA1c tests .  
Because treatment with BH4 is hypothesized to restore nNOS function in the control of 
gastric accommodation, the nutr ient satiety test (Section 6.7) was chosen for the primary 
endpoint for this study. Gastric accommodation has been measured using ultrasonography 
(Undeland et al , 1998), single-photon emission computed tomography ( Bredenoord et al, 
2003), and barostat testing ( Coulie et al, 1998; Sarnelli  et al, 2001).  Barostat studies have 
been shown to be reproducible ( Sarnelli et al, 2001 ) but are invasive and not widely 
available. Satiety testing using a nutrient liquid has been shown to be reproducible ( Kindt et 
al, 2008) and correlate with impairment in gastric accommodation but not gastric emptying 
or visceral sensitivity  (Tack et al, 2003).  
The GEBT is nonradioactive, noninvasive test of gastric emptying rate that has been 
validated against the reference method of gastric scintigraphy . It has been accepted by the 
United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in the measurement of the rate of gastric emptying of solids and as an aid in the diagnosis of delayed gastric emptying (gastroparesis) in adult humans who are symptomatic for gastroparesis. The GEBT can determine how fast the stomach empties a standardized  meal with a 
13C-labeled egg 
component by measuring the ratio of 13CO 2 to carbon -12 dioxide (12CO 2) collected in breath 
samples at multiple time points after the meal is consumed compared to baseline. The breath 
samples are collected in capped glass tubes and sent to a specified local laboratory for 
analysis. By measuring the change in the ratio o f 13CO 2 to 12CO 2 over time in comparison to 
the premeal value, the rate of 13CO 2 excretion can be calculated and the gastric emptying rate 
determined. The GEBT does not require administration by specially trained health care professionals or special precau tions related to radiation -emitting compounds ( Section 6.10).  
The GCSI  (Section  6.8, Appendix 2), consisting of a subset of items from the PAGI- SYM 
instrument (Section 6.9, Appendix 2) (described below), is based on reviews of the medical 
literature and results from clinician interviews and patient focus groups. Its reliability and validity were examined in 169 gastroparesis patients from 7  clinical centers in the US. 
Patients completed the GCSI, SF -36 Health Survey, and disability day questions at baseline 
and again at 8 weeks. Clinicians independently rated the severity of the patients' symptoms, and both clini cians and patients rated the changes in gastroparesis -related symptoms over the 
8weeks. For the GCSI total score, the internal consistency reliability was 0.84, and the test-re-test reliability was 0.76. Significant relationships were observed between the clinician -
assessed symptom severity and the GCSI total score, and significant associations were found between the GCSI scores and SF -36 physical and mental component summary scores and 
restricted activity and bed disability days. Patients with greater symp tom severity, as rated by 
CNSA -001 (sepiapterin)                                                                                                        Censa Pharmaceuticals

CONFIDENTIAL  clinicians, reported greater symptom severity on the GCSI. The GCSI total scores were 
responsive to changes in overall gastroparesis symptoms as assessed by clinicians (p = 0.0002) and patients (p = 0.002) ( Revicki et al, 2003). 
The PAGI -SYM  (Section 6.9, Appendix 2) is a 20-item upper GI  symptom severity 
instrument with 6  subscales: heartburn/regurgitation, fullness/early satiety, nausea/vomiting, 
bloating, upper abdominal pain, and lower abdominal pain. To develop the instrument, patients with GERD (n  = 810), dyspepsia (n = 767), or g astroparesis (n  = 169) from the US, 
France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, and Poland completed the PAGI-SYM, the SF-36 Health Su rvey, a disease- specific health -related quality of life  measure ( Patient Assessment 
of Upper Gastrointes tinal Disorders -Quality of Life [PAGI -QOL]), and disability day 
questions. Two-week reproducibility was evaluated in 277 stable patients. Construct vali dity 
was evaluated by correlating subscale scores with SF -36, PAGI-QOL and global symptom 
severity scores and disability days. Internal consistency reliability ranged from 0.79 to 0.91, and test -retest reliability ranged from 0.60 to 0.82 for the PAGI- SYM subscales. The 
PAGI -SYM subscale scores correlated significantly with SF -36 scores (all p <0.0001), 
PAGI -QOL scores (all p <0.0001), disability days (p <0.0001), and global symptom severity 
(p <0.0001). Mean PAGI-SYM scores varied significantly in groups defined by disability days (all p <0.0001), in which greater symptom severity was associated with more disability days ( Rentz et al, 2004; Revicki et al, 2004).

CONFIDENTIAL  9 PLANNED STATISTICAL METHODS  
9.1 General Considerations  
Descriptive statistics, including numbers and percentages for categorical variables, and 
numbers, means, standard deviations, medians, minimums, and maximums for continuous variables will be provided. Exploratory analyses may also be performed. Listings of individual patient data will be produced. Additional details can be found in the statistical 
analysis plan . 
9.2 Determination of Sample Size 
The primary objective of this study is to assess the impact of CNSA -001 on gastric 
accommodation , as measured by nutrient satiety testing (Section 6.7), in women wi th 
moderate to severe diabetic gastroparesis . A total of 10 patients will be enr olled in each 
treatment group. If it is assume d that the standard deviation for the change from baseline in 
nutrient meal volume ingested is approximately 2 35 mL ( data on file ), and using a one-sided 
t-test at the 0.025 significance level, this trial has 80% power to detect a treatment difference 
greater than 288 mL (i.e., an effect size of 1.23) in the CNSA-001group. The study also has 
90% power to detect a treatment difference greater than 330 mL (i.e., an effect size of 1.41) 
in the CNSA-001 group. 
9.3 Analysis Populations 
Two study populations will be analyzed: 
• Safety population: all patients who were randomized and received any amount of study 
drug (CNSA -001 or placebo) 
• Efficacy population: all patients who were randomized, received any amount of study 
drug (CNSA -001 or placebo), and had available Day 1 predose and Day  14 nutrient 
satiety test (Section 6.7) maximum tolerated volume results  
9.4 Demographics, Baseline Characteristics , Enrollment, Protocol Deviations, 
and Patient Disposition  
Enrollment, protocol deviations, demographics (age, sex , race/ethnicity ), prior and 
concomitant me dications, and m edical history  will be summarized by treatment group using 
descriptive statistics. Discontinuations from study drug and the study will be summarized by 
treatment group as well  and the reasons for discontinuation will be listed. 
9.5 Statistical Analysis of Efficacy  Variables  
Efficacy will be assessed in the Efficacy population.  
The primary  efficacy measure will be the changes in maximal tolerated volume consumed 
during the nutrient satiety test (Section 6.7) from Day 1  to Day  14 and Day  28. The changes 
from Day 1 to Day 14 and from Day 1 to Day 28 in maximal tolerated volume consumed

CONFIDENTIAL  during the nutrient satiety test will be compared between tr eatment groups using a student’s 
t-test.  
Secondary efficacy measures will consist of changes in the following from baseline through 
Day 14 (±1 day) and through Day 28 (±1 day ):  
• PAGI -SYM (Section 6.9, Appendix 2) subscale (heartburn/regurgitation, fullness/early 
satiety, nausea/vomiting, bloating, upper abdominal pain, and lower abdominal pain) scores  
• Gastric emptying as measured by the GEBT  (Section 6.10) 
The primary and secondary measures will be summarized by treatment group at each visit as well as changes from baseline using summary statistics (number of patients, mean, standard 
deviation, median, and range) including 95% confidence intervals for changes from baseline. Additional analyses may be conducted, and details will be provided in the statistical analysis plan (SAP).  
9.6 Safety Analysis 
Safety will be assessed in the Safety population. The AEs  will be coded using the Medical 
Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA
®). The number and perc entage of patients 
with TEAEs  will be tabulated by system organ class, preferred term, and treatment group. 
Severity of AEs and SAEs  will be summarized similarly. Those AEs leading to premature 
discontinuation from the study drug and the serious TEAEs will be presented in a table or a listing. Clinical laboratory and HbA1c  test results and vital signs will be summarized at each 
visit as will changes from baseline for each treatment group.  A frequency distribution of 
abnormal physical examination results will be provided. Additional detail s will be provided 
in the SAP.

reviews, and regulatory inspections. 
10.10 Data Generation and Analysis 
Some or all of the obligations of implementing or conducting this study may be transferred 
from Censa Pharmaceuticals to the CRO.  
A case report, comprised of individual eCRFs, will be completed for every patient who signs 
an ICF and is enrolled into the study. 
All original source documentation (laboratory results, treatment records, audit query 
responses, etc.) will be retained by the Investigator or institution unless specified otherwise by the protocol. The result s as they become available will be entered on the appropriate 
eCRFs. Legible reproductions of the original laboratory reports for selected tests or variables will be submitted to Censa Pharmaceuticals  or CRO as requested.  
The eCRFs will be reviewed by a cl inical monitor who will evaluate the completeness and 
accuracy of the data. Queries will be generated for omissions, corrections, and clarifications. Data may also be reviewed in -house by a clinical auditor and data management or other 
personnel. 
Data analyses will be performed after database lock, when all queries have been resolved.  
10.11 Retention of Data  
Study documents should be retained for a minimum of 2 years after the last approval of a 
marketing application in an ICH region and until there are no pending or contemplated 
marketing applications in an ICH region or until at least 2  years have elapsed since the 
formal discontinuation of clinical development of the investigational product. These documents should be retained for a longer period, however, if required by local regulations. No records will be destroyed without the written consent of Censa Pharmaceuticals , if

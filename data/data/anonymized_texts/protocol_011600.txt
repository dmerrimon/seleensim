 STUDY SYNOPSIS  
Title:  A Phase 3 Multi -Center, Randomized, Double -Blind, Vehicle -Controlled, Parallel 
Group Study Comparing the Efficacy  and Safety of SB206 and Vehicle Gel Once 
Daily in the Treatment of Molluscum Contagiosum  
Rationale:  Molluscum contagiosum (MC) is spread easily by close contact and 
autoinoculation from scratching or trauma. Although a single lesion of molluscum 
contagiosum is benign and generally self -limiting to about 2 months, many cases 
have an extended infection per iod, up to 2 years, due to autoinoculation. There is 
a significant unmet medical need to treat MC, considering most patients with MC 
are healthy young children and the disease is highly contagious. Ablative treatment 
often causes fear in children and may i nterfere in physician -patient relationships; 
repeated ablative treatments are difficult. Topical application of SB206 may 
accelerate resolution of MC without causing pain  and/or scar ring, decrease the 
need for ablative treatment and provide an effective, s afe and convenient treatment 
option for MC.  
Target 
Population
: Males and females, 6 months of age and older, with a minimum of 3 and a 
maximum of 70 MC lesions at Baseline.  
Number of 
Subjects:  Approximately 340 subjects randomized.  
Objectives:  This study is being conducted to evaluate the efficacy  and safety of SB206 12% 
QD for the treatment of MC.   
Dosing 
Regimen  Subjects will apply treatment once daily to all lesions identified at Baseline and 
new lesions that arise during treat ment for a minimum of 4 weeks and up to 12 
weeks. If the investigator determines all lesions are cleared at a clinic visit, the 
treatment may stop. If treatment is stopped due to clearance, subjects will continue 
regularly scheduled visits through Week 24 /ET2. Each dose of SB206 will consist 
of hydrogel thoroughly mixed with berdazimer sodium gel . Each dose of  vehicle 
will consist of hydrogel thoroughly mixed with vehicle gel. T he subject or 
caregiver will apply to the lesions  and approximately 1 cm surrounding each 
lesion.  
Periocular lesions will be treated if the lesions are at least 2 cm from the edge of 
the eye.

 Study 
Design:  This is a Phase 3 multi -center, randomized, double -blind, vehicle -controlled, 
parallel group study to be conducted in up to approximately 340 subjects  ≥6 
months of age with MC. After obtaining informed consent /assent , subjects who 
satisfy entry criteria wi ll be randomized 2:1 (active :vehicle). Subjects receiving 
current treatment for MC at the time of the Screening Visit will enter a wash out 
period of up to 14 days prior to randomization. In the event no wash out period is 
required , Screening and Baseline visit activities may be combined in to a single 
visit.  At randomization, subjects will be stratified into four strata corresponding to 
the cross -classification of household number of randomized subjects (1 subject per 
household vs 2 subjects per household) and investigator type (dermatologist vs 
other).   Households randomizing 2 subjects would receive the same treatment 
assignment for both subjects.   
Subjects or their caregivers will apply SB206 12% or Vehicle Gel once daily for 
a minimum of 4 weeks and up to 12 weeks to all lesions identified at Baseline and 
new treatable lesions that arise during the course of the study. Subjects or their 
caregivers will continue to treat the area until the next scheduled visit even if the 
lesion(s) clear. If the investiga tor determines all lesions are cleared at a clinic visit, 
the treatment may stop. If treatment is stopped due to clearance, subjects will 
continue regularly scheduled visits through Week 24/ET2 . At Weeks 2, 4, and 8 , 
the investigator will count and record the number of active (raised, treatable) 
molluscum lesions per body area. At Weeks 2, 4, and 8 , the investigator  will 
determine if new lesions have occurred since the last visit, and t he subject or 
caregiver will be instructed by the investigator  to re-initiate treatment.  
Subjects will visit the clinic at Screening /Baseline, Week 2, Week 4, Week 8, 
Week 12 , and Week 24 . Subjects will be contacted via phone on Day 2 to collect 
subject i nformation on early dose reactions. At Weeks 16 and 20, subjects will be 
contacted via phone  to capture information regarding MC recurrence  and AEs ; at 
Week 24, the subject will be seen at the site  for a final study visit  to assess scarring, 
keloid , and MC recurrence . Subjects who discontinue the study prior to the Week 
12 visit due to adverse events  (AEs)  or other reasons  will be asked to complete the 
Week 12 visit assessments; this will be recorded as an Early Termination (ET 1) 
visit. No study drug treatm ent will be provided after the Week 12 visit . Subjects 
who discontinue from the study after Week 12 but prior to Week 24 will be asked 
to come to the site to complete Week 24 assessments ; this visit will be recorded as 
an ET2 visit.

 Safety assessments incl ude Beginning of the End ( BOTE ) Inflammation Scores, 
Local Skin Reaction s (LSR s), adverse event collection , including scarring /keloid , 
and urine pregnancy tests (UPTs). Safety assessments will be completed at 
specified site visits through Week 12. After Week 12, safety information for 
ongoing  AEs and new AEs will be collected , along  with information regarding 
household MC occurrence.  
Inflammatory reaction s around the MC have been associated with imminent 
resolution of MC  (sometimes referred to as “ beginning -of-the-end” [“BOTE ”] 
sign).  In most cases, clinical features can differentiate between BOTE and LSR. 
BOTE may be associated with itch, but not pain. BOTE is usually asymptomatic, 
self-limited, localized to individual M C lesions, and does not require 
discontinuation of study treatment or additional treatment.  LSR is generally more 
diffuse, associated with significant itch or tenderness, may necessitate 
discontinuation of study treatment and  may need treatment for symptom atic relief 
(e.g. a topical corticosteroid or topical anesthetic).  For very severe LSR, systemic 
corticosteroids may be considered.  Investigators will assess the treatment area at 
each scheduled visit and use their medical judgement to differentiate betwee n 
BOTE a nd LSRs. BOTE Inflammation  Score and LSR score will be recorded at 
each visit. BOTE should not be considered an AE. When LSRs are clinically 
significant, the Investigator should report the condition as AE(s).  At Baseline (30 
min. post-dose) and Weeks 2  through  Week 12, the Investigator s will rate LSR s 
on individual features including erythema, flaking/scaling, crusting, swelling, 
vesiculation /pustulation, and erosion/ulceration .

Clinically significant  LSRs that are reported as  adverse events and/or subject 
reported intolerability (i.e. itching, pain) may result in an investigator directed 
temporary treatment hold (drug holiday), and topical corticosteroids may be used 
to treat LSRs for up to 2 weeks. The subject may re -initiate study drug treatment 
prior to the next scheduled visit. Upon re -initiation of study drug treatment, if a 
subject develops worsening LSRs, allergic contact dermatitis may be suspected. 
The investigator may take photographs of the suspected allergic contact dermatitis 
and discuss p ossible confirmation of allergic contact dermatitis with the CRO 
medical monitor. The investigator should also discuss necessity of patch testing 
with the subject/caregiver. The investigator will then discontinue the subject from 
study drug treatment and t reat the area(s) with corticosteroids for up to 2 weeks. 
If the subject provides consent/assent, the investigator will consult the contract

 research organization ( CRO ) medical monitor to implement the process for patch 
testing.  
Adverse events will be asse ssed and collected after the initiation of study drug 
treatment through the end of the subject’s last visit. Treatment related adverse 
events will be followed up until resolution or up to one year after last treatment, 
whichever  is sooner.  
Scar formation will be assessed starting at the Week 4 visit  through Week 12 and 
again  at Week 24. The investigator will map locations of the molluscum lesions at 
Baseline. Additional lesions identified through Week 12 will be added to the map. 
Using the map as a guidanc e, the investigator will assess the treated areas for 
scar/keloid  formation . The investigator will count and record the number of active 
(raised, treatable) molluscum lesion s per body area . If a scar is larger than 5mm in 
diameter and/or larger than 1 mm d eep, this will be considered an adverse event 
for the purposes of this study. In addition, keloid/hypertrophic scars will also be 
recorded as adverse events . Any scars <5mm in diameter and/or <1mm deep will 
not be considered AEs since these are considered part of the normal healing.  
If a subject’s treatment is discontinued by the investigator  or the subject because 
of an AE, that AE should be indicated as the reason for treatment discontinuation.  
All subjects will be encouraged to remain in the study throug hout the 24-week 
study duration.  
In the event of suspected allergic contact dermatitis, photographs may be taken of 
the affected area(s) and transmitted to the CRO medical monitor for review prior 
to initiating patch testing. Photography is not a protocol requirement and subjects 
must have documented consent for photographs to be taken.   
When approximately 200 subjects  (cumulative across studies MC301 and MC302 ) 
have completed 4 weeks of treatment , a Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) 
will review all available unblinded safety data  (including patch testing) .

Statistics:  Statistical Methods  
Safety and efficacy endpoints will be displayed using descriptive statistics and 
graphical displays , where applicable . For categorical variables, frequencies, and 
percentages will be presented. The denominators for percentages will be based on 
the number of subjects appropriate for the purpose of analysis. Continuous 
variables will be summarized using descriptive statistics (number of subjects, 
mean, median, standard deviation (SD), minimum, and maximum). Where 
relevant, 95% confidence intervals will be calculated. All statistical tests of the 
primary and secondary endpoints will be conducted at the 0.05 significance level 
using 2 -tailed tests. Nominal p -values will be reported for treatment comparisons 
of the exploratory endpoints.  
The study treatment period is defin ed from randomization through completion of 
Week 12/ET1 visit and the safety follow -up period is from the completion of Week 
12 through the completion of Week 24/ET2 visit.  
The analysis populations include the following:  
Safety Population  (SAF) : The Safety  population will consist of all subjects who 
receive at least one application of study medication.  
Intent -To-Treat Population (ITT):  The ITT population will consist of all 
subjects who are randomized.  
Per-Protocol Population (PP):  The PP population will co nsist of all subjects in 
the ITT population who had no significant protocol deviations that impacted the 
analyses of the efficacy endpoints.  
The primary efficacy endpoint, proportion of subjects with complete clearance of 
all treatable molluscum lesions at  Week 12 in the ITT, will be analyzed using a 
generalized estimating equation (GEE) for logistic regression  with an 
exchangeable working correlation structure . The model will include treatment, 
investigator type (dermatologist vs other), household number of randomized 
subjects (1 subject per household vs 2 subjects per household),  age and Baseline 
lesion count as factors. The odds ratio between SB206 12% and vehicle gel, 95% 
CIs for the odds ratio, and P-value for the covariate -adjusted treatment comparison  
will be presented. Only subjects who achieve complete clearance at Week 12 will 
be counted as responders for the primary analysis; all other subjects (e.g., those 
Page 12/70
16.1.1 Protocol NI -MC30 1

 who discontinue the study before achieving complete clearance) will be reported 
as failures. As a sensitivity analysis, the primary efficacy analysis will also be 
reported for the PP population.  
 
The familywise error rate with respect to the primary endpoint and secondary 
endpoint will be strongly controlled at the alpha=0.05 level using a fixed -sequence 
method  testing strategy. If the primary endpoint is not statistically significant at 
the alpha=0.05 level, the secondary efficacy endpoint will be considered not 
significant. If the primary endpoint is statistically significant at the alph a=0.05 
level, the secondary efficacy endpoint will be analyzed . 
• Proportion of all study subjects demonstrating complete clearance of all 
treatable MC at Week 8  
If the secondary efficacy endpoint fails to reach statistical significance at the 
alpha=0.05 lev el, it will be considered not statistically significant .  
The dichotomous secondary efficacy endpoint will be analyzed using the GEE 
model described for the primary efficacy endpoint.  The analyses methods to be 
used for the exploratory endpoints will be d etailed in the Statistical Analysis Plan 
(SAP).  
All safety and tolerability analyses will be based on the SAF population.  
All AEs that occur during the study will be recorded and coded using Medical 
Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) terminology . Treatment -
emergent AEs (TEAEs) are defined as AEs that occurred any time on or after the 
first in -clinic application of study drug  through the last application of study 
medication.  
Treatment -emergent AEs will be summarized by treatment group, the number of 
subjects reporting a TEAE, SOC, preferred term, severity, relationship to study 
drug (causality), and seriousness.  
Serious adverse events (SAEs) will be summarized by treatment group, severity, 
and relationship to study drug, and individual SAEs will be listed by subject. In 
addition, a list of subjects who prematurely discontinue from the study due to an 
AE will be provided.  
Urine pregnancy tests results for females 9 years old and older  will be presented 
in data listings by subject.

 Sample Size  Estimation  
The sample size assumptions for this study were informed by the completed Phase 
2 study NI -MC201 of subjects ≥2 years of age with 3 -70 MC lesions at Baseline.  
In the ITT population of the Phase 2 study, the observed rates of clearance at Week 
12 were 18% (12/66) for vehicle and 38% (18/48) for SB206 12% once daily (QD) 
and the covariate -adjusted treatment difference was 18%.  
Approximately 340 subjects, 6 months of years of age and older, with a minimum 
of 3 and a maximum of 70 lesions at Basel ine will be randomized in a 2:1 
(active:vehicle) scheme.  
A sample size of 340 subjects ( 227 subjects in the SB206 12% QD group and 113 
subjects in the vehicle group ) will provide 9 4% power for a 2 -sided alpha test of 
size 0.05 to detect an absolute difference of 18% when the vehicle response rate is 
18%. This same sample size provides 9 3% power to detect a treatment difference 
of 18% when the vehicle response rate is 2 0% and 83% powe r when the treatment 
difference is 15% and the vehicle response rate is 2 0%.

     1 INTRODUCTION AND RAT IONALE  
1.1 Background  
Molluscum contagiosum (MC) is a common skin disorder  that aﬀects mainly healthy children  
(Dohil et al, 2006) . MC has the greatest incidence in individuals aged 1 –14 years  (Schofiel d et al , 
2011) ; prevalence in children is between 5% and 1 1% (Olsen et al, 201 4).  
MC virus is an important human s kin pathogen  and can cause disﬁgurement and su ffering in 
children . In adults MC is less common and often sexually transmitted. Extensive and persistent 
skin infection with the virus can indicate und erlying immunodeﬁ ciency . MC virus  is distinct from 
other poxviruses because of its host and tissue adaptations. It infects only the skin and , rarely, the 
mucous membranes. The virus has developed e fficient mechanism s to grow in differentiating cells 
of the human epidermis and  is well adapted to human hosts  (Chen et al, 2013).   
Extensive and persistent skin infection with the virus can indicate underlying immunodeficiency. 
Patients with atopic dermatitis (AD) have an impaired skin barrier in addition to immunological 
changes which could explain the rising prevalence and high number of lesions in this population . 
Topical corti costeroids and calcineuri n inhibitors (both local immuno suppressants commonly 
applied to the skin in patients with atopic dermatitis) have been implicated as co ntributing factors 
in some patients  (Osio et al, 2011) . 
MC is transmitted between human hosts by the infectious matter discharged from the lesions. 
According to a prospective community cohort study (Olsen et al, 2015) , the mean time to 
resolution was 13.3 months (SD 8.2). Eighty (30%) of 269 cases had not resolved by 18 months;  
36 (13%) had not resolved by 24 months. Transmission to other children in the household occur 
in 102 (41%) of 250 cases  in the literature .  
Novan has conducted Study NI -MC201, a phase 2, multi -center, double -blind,  vehicle -controlled 
ascending dose, 12 -week study to assess the tolerability, safety, and efficacy of SB206 in subjects 
with molluscum contagiosum. In this study,  the safety and efficacy  of SB206 was evaluated in 256 
subjects , males or females, 2 years of age or older, with 3 to 70 MC lesions . Different 
concentrations and dosing frequency  of SB206 was tested for up to 12 weeks  and the number of 
the subjects of each  dose group were : 47 (4% BID), 48 (8% BID), 47 (12% BID), 48 (12% QD) 
and 66  (Vehicle) .   
 
The primary endpoint for Study NI -MC201  was the proportion of subjects in the modified intent -
to-treat population who achieved complete  clearance of all MC lesions a t Week 12. In th is analysis, 
8% BID  and 12% QD groups of SB206 were statistically significantly superior to vehicle in the  
proportion of subjects with complete clearance at Week 12: 20.0% (vehicle BID/QD combined), 
41.0% (8% BID: p=0.028), and 41.9%  (12% Q D: p=0.02 4). The 4% BID (13.2%, p=0.518) and 
Page 21/70
16.1.1 Protocol NI -MC30 1  
Novan: A Phase 3 Molluscum Contagiosum Efficacy and Safet y Study  Confidential  
SB206/Berdazimer Sodium Gel  Page 21 of 69 
 
 
    
    
     12% BID (35.1, p=0.144) were not statistically superior.  The efficacy signals appeared as early as 
2-4 weeks. In the  intent -to-treat (ITT) analysis, 37.5% of subjects achieved complete clearance 
when treated with  SB206 12% QD, compared to 18.2% of subjects achieving complete clearance 
with vehicle  BID/QD combined (p=0.024).   The ITT results will be the basis for the sample size 
criteria used in MC301.  
Based on the clear treatment effect shown by the pr oportion of subjects achieving complet e 
clearance of all molluscum lesions at Week 12 for SB206 12% once -daily, and favorable safety  
and tolerability profiles, Novan, Inc. (Novan) is conducting this  Phase 3 multi-center, randomized, 
double -blind, vehicle -controlled, parallel group study  of SB206 in subjects 6 months of age and 
older  with molluscum contagiosum . SB206  is a topical gel, formed by mixing berdazimer sodium 
(NVN1000 ) gel with hydrogel. Berdazimer sodium  gel contains berdazimer sodium , a nitric oxide -
releasing macromolecule containing covalently bound N -diazeniumdiolate nitric oxide donors; 
nitric oxide release from the macromolecule is initiated by mixing berdazimer sodium  gel with 
hydrogel.  
Topical formulations of berdazimer so dium at concentrations ranging from 1 -16% have been 
studied .  Over 16 00 healthy volunteers or subjects with MC, acne, genital warts or tinea pedis have 
been exposed to Vehicle and over 2700 exposed to berdazimer sodium  as of December 31, 2018 . 
In clinical studie s completed to date, topical application of berdazimer sodium  has generally been 
well-tolerated with no safety concerns identified.  
1.1.1  Preclinical Pharmacology  
During the development of SB204 (berdazimer sodium gel co -administered with hydrogel) for 
acne, SB2 06 (berdazimer sodium gel co -administered with hydrogel) for the treatment of external 
genital warts and perianal warts, SB208 (berdazimer sodium gel co -administered with hydrogel) 
for tinea pedis and SB414 (berdazimer sodium ointment co -administered with hydrogel), Novan 
has conducted over 90 nonclinical studies. In addition, specifically for SB206, Novan completed 
a 4-week daily dosing with 2 -week recovery GLP dermal bridging study in miniature swine. Under 
the conditions of this study, the No Observed Ad verse Effect Level (NOAEL) was considered to 
be greater than the nominal dose level evaluated ( ~48 mg/kg/day berdazimer sodium  which 
equates  to approximately 1.7 mg/cm2/day), administered as BID 8% SB206 Gel or QD 12% SB206 
Gel. There were no meaningful effects o n mortality/moribundity , clinical observations, physical 
examination findings, food consumption, weekly body weight or weekly body weight change, 
clinical pathology parameters, o phthalmologic or electrocardiographic examinations , or organ 
weight findings . Microscopic changes, limited to the superficial dermis and epidermis, were 
minimal to mild but had not completely resolved following the 2 -week recovery period. The 
induced changes included hyperkeratosis, epidermal hyperplasia and mononuclear dermal 
inflammation  (mononuclear cell infiltration and dermal edema ). Due to an insufficient number of 
plasma samples with quantifiable hydrolyzed n -methylaminopropyl -trimethoxy silane  (hMAP3 )

     concentrations (values above the LOQ of 5 ng/mL),  it was not possible to perform a 
noncompartmental TK analysis. There was no evidence of systemic nitric oxide exposure at any 
of the dose levels tested. This study with SB206 in miniature swi ne was successful in bridging the 
safety of topical administration of berdazimer sodium  in the SB204 formulation with the SB206 
formulation.  
For additional information refer to the Investigator ’s Brochure (IB).  
1.1.2  Pharmacokinetics  
The systemic bioavailability of berdazimer sodium after dermal administration has been 
investigated in two maximal  use studies in adults and adolescent subjects with moderate to severe 
acne vulgaris, and no quantifiable systemic exposure was observed. In a dult subjects with 
moderate to severe acne vulgaris (NI -AC101) administration of SB204 8% ( berdazimer sodium  
gel 16% co -administered with hydrogel)  or Vehicle Gel daily for 5 days to the face, chest, back, 
upper shoulders twice daily (BID) (17% body surfac e area [BSA]) showed no detectable systemic 
exposure on Day 1 or Day 5 to hydrolyzed N -methylaminopropyl -trimethoxysilane (hMAP3 ), a 
silicon containing component of the parent compound . There was no noticeable difference in 
systemic nitrate levels on Day 1  or Day 5 in subjects treated with SB204 or Vehicle Gel and no 
evidence of accumulation. Likewise, in an open -label pharmacokinetic (PK), study (NI -AC103) 
in adolescents (ages 9 -16 years) with m oderate to severe acne v ulgaris topical administration of 
SB20 4 4% was applied once daily (QD) for 21  days to 17% BSA and again no detectable systemic 
exposure to hMAP3 and no plasma nitrate concentrations outside of normal variability and 
negligible accumulation of nitrate after 21 days of dosing.  
Additionally, in a 4 -way, randomized, double -blind, cross -over study examining 
electrocardiogram (ECG) effects following SB204 application (NI -AC104), there was no 
quantifiable systemic exposure to hMAP3 and no difference in plasma nitrate levels in 48 subjects 
with modera te to severe acne treated with SB204 ( berdazimer sodium ) 4%, SB204 ( berdazimer 
sodium ) 12% or Vehicle Gel applied to 17% BSA . No changes in ECG were observed with 
therapeutic or supratherapeutic doses of SB204.  
In a 2 -week atopic dermatitis (AD) study (NI -AD101), and a 4 -week psoriasis (NI -PS101) study, 
a limited number of subjects who received SB414 6% (berdazimer sodium ointment 12% co -
administered with buffered hydrogel) demonstrated quantifiable systemic exposure to the study 
treatment at limited time p oints. Although both SB206 and SB414 have the same active 
pharmaceutical ingredient, the formulations are different: SB206 is  a gel and SB414 is  a cream . 
The cream formulation of SB414 resulted in low and not quantifiable systemic exposure to hMAP3 
observe d in the NI -AD101 and NI -PS101 studies for all but 2 subjects at 12 hours post -dose.  Note 
that SB414 formulation is cream while SB204 formulation is gel, similar to SB206.

SB206/Berdazimer Sodium Gel  Page 23 of 69 
 
 
    
    
     In the NI -MC201 study, plasma hMAPs concentrations in all PK blood samples at Week  12 or end 
or treatment were below the lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ).  
1.1.3  Potential for Drug -Drug Interactions  
Since no quantifiable  exposure has been observed to date with SB204 and SB206 clinically , the 
risk of drug -drug interactions is low.  
1.1.4  Clinical Adverse Event Profile  
As of December 31, 2018, t opical formulations of berdazimer sodium at concentrations ranging 
from 1% to 16% have been studied in 2 1 completed studies. Almost 1 600 healthy volunteers or 
subjects with acne, genital warts, tinea pedis, psoriasis and atopic dermatitis  have been exposed to 
Vehicle and over 2700 exposed to berdazimer sodium.  
Novan completed a Phase 2 ascending dose study of SB206 in 256 s ubjects with MC. No deaths 
or serious adverse events ( SAEs ) occurred during this study. Seven subjects were discontinued 
from treatment with the study drug due to an AE, all in active treatment groups (3 subjects in the 
4% BID group; 2 in the 8% BID group; and 2 in the 12%  BID group). Treatment discontinuation 
was due to application site reactions in 6 of these subjects and to worsening MC in the other. The 
active study drug (SB206) given at doses ranging from 4% BID to 12% QD was well tolerated. 
Most AEs were mild to moder ate. The only AEs that appeared to be clearly associated with SB206 
were those involving administration site reactions.  
Novan completed a Phase 2 ascending dose study assessing the tolerability, safety, and efficacy of 
SB206 in  subjects with external genit al warts (EGW) and perianal warts (PAW). In this study, 
there were no safety concerns with single daily dose application; BID application of SB206 to the 
genitalia was associated with local application site reactions in some subjects which led to 
treatment  discontinuation. The results of this study are supportive of the continued clinical 
development of SB206.  
SB204 is in development for the treatment of acne vulgaris. The acne clinical program for SB204 
includes 9 completed Phase 1 studies in healthy volun teers or subjects with acne vulgaris, 3 
completed Phase 2 studies, and the completed Phase 3 program (two 12 -week placebo -controlled 
studies and one 40 -week open label long -term safety study in subjects ages 9 years old and older). 
Based on the clinical da ta acquired to date, topical application of berdazimer sodium  to healthy 
volunteers or subjects with acne vulgaris has generally been well -tolerated with no safety concerns 
identified.  
Novan has also completed a study in subjects with tinea pedis using SB2 08. There were no safety 
concerns identified with QD dosing to one or both feet; there were no application site AEs reported.

     Novan has completed two studies in subjects with atopic dermatitis and psoriasis using SB414. In 
both studies, SB414 was generally  well tolerated and the incidence of treatment -related treatment -
emergent adverse events (TEAEs) was low. Administration site reactions were the most common 
treatment -related adverse events and tolerability (change in itch and burning/stinging) was similar  
across treatment groups. There was no evidence of meaningful trends in safety parameters.  In 
completed studies, no clinically significant changes have been observed in laboratory assessments 
in subjects treated with topical berdazimer sodium . There have b een no clinically significant 
changes in physical examination, including vital signs, in subjects treated with topical berdazimer 
sodium . 
1.1.5  Elevations in Liver Function Tests  
No clinically significant changes have been observed in laboratory assessments . 
1.1.6  Potential Risk of Testicular Injury  
In a nonclinical GLP study of fertility and  early embryonic development in rats after daily oral 
administration of berdazimer sodium  there was no adverse findings in male fertility parameters or 
reproductive parameters in either sex.  
Additionally,  since no quantifiable exposure has been observed to date  after dermal administration 
of SB204 and SB206 clinically, the risk of testicular i njury is low.  
1.1.7  Potential Risk to Fetal Development  
Oral administration of berdazimer sodium drug substance in GLP embryo -fetal developmental 
toxicity studies  in rats and rabbits showed minor effects on fetal development only at the highest 
doses.  
Additional ly, due to the lack of systemic exposure after dermal administration of SB204 clinically 
and SB206 clinically observed to date, the risk to fetal development is low.  
In prior studies using berdazimer sodium  in different diseases, there hav e been 6 reported  
pregnancies ; of those, two were completed to term with healthy babies. One woman had an elective 
termination of her pregnancy and one woman had a miscarriage. The outcome of the other two 
pregnancies is unknown.  
1.2 Study Rationale  
MC is benign and generally  self-limiting. The average duration of a single lesion is about 2 months; 
however, since the lesions spread easily by autoinoculation from scratching or trauma, the mean 
duration of infection is often more than a year.

     Nitric oxide, an endogenous small mo lecule, provides localized immunity against foreign 
organisms by acting both as a short -lived immune modulator and a direct broad -spectrum 
antimicrobial agent. Topical exogenous nitric oxide has been investigated as an antimicrobial agent 
due to its broad -spectrum activity, ability to inhibit viral replication, and the ability to readily 
diffuse through cell membranes.  
There is a significant unmet medical need to treat MC, considering most patients with MC are 
healthy young children. Ablative treatment ofte n causes fear to the children and interfere s in 
physician -patient relationships. Repeated ablative treatment s are difficult. Using anesthesia 
involves safety risk and costs. Not treating increases the potential of further dissemination of the 
disease. Prevention of further dissemination of the disease is also important from a public health 
perspective.  Topical application of SB206 may accelerate resolution of MC without causing pain  
and/or scar ring, decrease the frequency of ablative treatment , and provide an effective, convenient 
treatment option for patients with MC.  
1.2.1  Dosing Regimen  
Subjects will apply treatment once daily to all lesions identified at Baseline and new lesions that 
arise during treatment for a minim um of 4 weeks and up to 12 weeks. Each dose of SB206 will 
consist of hydrogel thoroughly mixed with berdazimer sodium gel . Each dose of  vehicle will 
consist of hydrogel thoroughly mixed with vehicle gel. Subjects will be instructed on the correct 
use of st udy drug and the amount to apply during Baseline/Day 1 according to the corresponding 
subject instructions for use that will be provided to the subject.  In addition, study personnel will 
ensure that the subjects or caregivers can identify the treatment are a(s) and know where  and how  
to apply the study drug. Dosing should be applied at home , except on the day of study visits when 
the dose should be applied in the clinic. The subject , caregiver , or study personnel  will apply to 
the lesions  and approximately 1  cm surrounding each lesion.  Periocular lesions will be treated if 
the lesions are at least 2 cm from the edge of the eye.  
If the investigator determines all lesions are cleared at a clinic visit, the treatment may stop. At 
Weeks 2, 4, and 8, the investig ator will determine if new lesions have occurred since the last visit, 
and t he subject or caregiver will be instructed by the investigator  to re-initiate treatment. If 
treatment is stopped due to clearance, subjects will continue regularly scheduled visits through 
Week 24/ET2 . Subjects will be followed for recurrence /new lesions until Week 24. For the purpose 
of this study, a recurrence  of MC will be documented as an AE.  
1.2.2  Dose Selection Rationale  
Novan completed a Phase 2 a scending dose study of SB206 in 256 s ubjects with MC. The primary 
endpoint for Study NI -MC201 was the proportion of subjects in the modified intent -to-treat 
population who achieved complete clearance of all MC lesions at Week 12. In this analysis, 8%

     BID and 12% QD group s of SB206 were statistically significantly superior to vehicle in the 
proportion of subjects with complete clearance at Week 12: 20.0% (vehicle BID/QD combined), 
41.0% (8% BID: p=0.028), and 41.9% (12% QD: p=0.024). The difference in proportion (95% 
CI) f rom vehicle was statistically significant for 8% BID (0.206 [0.022, 0.389], P = 0.028) and 
12% QD (0.204 [0.027, 0.381], P = 0.024). A sensitivity analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint 
in the ITT population produced results consistent with the primary analysis results . Secondary and 
exploratory  efficacy endpoints also support selection of 12% QD.  In the Phase 2 study, 7  subjects 
were discontinued from treatment with the study drug due to an AE, all in active treatment groups 
(3 subjects in the 4% BID gr oup; 2 in the 8% BID group; and 2 in the 12% BID group). Treatment 
discontinuation was due to application site reactions in 6 of these subjects and to worsening MC 
in the other.  No subject discontinued treatment due to AEs in the 12% QD group.  
Based on tot ality of the data, SB206 12% QD was selected for this Phase 3 study.  
2 STUDY OBJECTIVE  
This study is being conducted to evaluate the efficacy  and safety of SB206 12% QD for the 
treatment of MC.

3.4 Safety Endpoints  
Safety assessments will be performed at scheduled timepoints throughout the study and include 
physical examination, urine pregnancy test, Beginning of the End ( BOTE ) Inflammation Score, 
Local Skin Reaction  Scores  (LSRs) , concomitant medications , and adverse events  (including 
scarring /keloid  scarring ). 
4 STUDY PLAN  
4.1 Study Design  
This is a Phase 3 multi -center, randomized, double -blind, vehicle -controlled, parallel group study 
to be conducted in approximately 340 subjects wit h MC. After obtaining informed consent/assent, 
subjects who satisfy entry criteria will be randomized 2:1 (active:vehicle). Subjects receiving 
current treatment for MC at the time of the Screening Visit will enter a wash out period of up to 
14 days prior t o randomization. In the event no wash out period is required. Screening and Baseline 
visit activities may be combined into a single visit. At randomization, subjects will be stratified 
into four strata corresponding to the cross -classification of household  number of randomized 
subjects (1 subject per household vs 2 subjects per household) and  investigator type (dermatologist 
vs other).   Households randomizing 2 subjects will receive the same treatment assignment for both 
subjects. Up to two subjects from th e same household may be randomized on the same day, if both 
individually meet all inclusion/exclusion criteria.  For subjects in the same household, S creening 
can occur on different days; however, the Baseline visit must occur on the same day.

     Subjects or  their caregivers will apply SB206 12% or Vehicle Gel once daily for a minimum of 4 
weeks and up to 12 weeks to all lesions identified at Baseline and new treatable lesions that arise 
during the course of the study. Subjects or their caregivers will contin ue to treat the area until the 
next scheduled visit even if the lesion(s) clear. If the investigator determines all lesions are cleared 
at a clinic visit, the treatment may stop. At Weeks 2, 4, and 8 , the investigator will count and record 
the number of active (raised, treatable) molluscum lesions per body area. T he investigator will also 
determine if new lesions have occurred since the last visit, and the subject or caregiver will be 
instructed by the investigator to re -initiate treatment. If treatment i s stopped due to clearance, 
subjects will continue regularly scheduled visits through Week 24.  
Subjects will visit the clinic at Screening/Baseline, Week 2, Week 4, Week 8, Week 12, and Week 
24. Subjects will be contacted via phone on Day 2 to collect subj ect information on early dose 
reactions. At Weeks 16 and 20, subjects will be contacted via phone to capture information 
regarding MC recurrence  and AEs; at Week 24,  the subject will be seen at the site for a final study 
visit. Subjects who discontinue the  study prior to the Week 12 visit due to adverse events or other 
reasons will be asked to complete the Week 12 visit assessments; this will be recorded as an Early 
Termination (ET1) visit. No study drug treatment will be provided after the Week 12 visit. S ubjects 
who discontinue from the study after Week 12 but prior to Week 24 will be asked to come to the 
site to complete Week 24 assessments; this visit will be recorded as an ET2 visit.  
Safety assessments include BOTE Inflammation Scores, Local Skin Reacti on Scores  (LSRs), 
adverse event collection, including scarring /keloid  and urine pregnancy tests (UPTs). Safety 
assessments will be completed at specified site visits through Week 12. After Week 12, safety 
information for ongoing AEs and new AEs will be col lected, along with information regarding 
MC recurrence . For the purpose of this study, a recurrence  of MC will be documented as an AE.  
Inflammatory reactions around the MC has been associated with imminent resolution of MC 
(sometimes referred to as “beginn ing-of-the-end” [“BOTE”] sign). The investigator (or designated 
evaluator) will assess the presence and overall degree of inflammatory reactions at MC lesions at 
Baseline (pre -dose) and Weeks 2 -12. In most cases, clinical features can differentiate between  
BOTE and LSR. BOTE may be associated with itch, but not pain. BOTE is usually asymptomatic, 
self-limited, localized to individual MC lesions, and does not require discontinuation of study 
treatment or additional treatment. LSR is generally more diffuse, a ssociated with significant itch 
or tenderness, may necessitate discontinuation of study treatment and may need treatment for 
symptomatic relief (e.g. a topical corticosteroid or topical anesthetic). For very severe LSR, 
systemic corticosteroids may be cons idered.  Investigators will assess the treatment area at each 
scheduled visit and use their medical judgement to differentiate between BOTE a nd LSRs. BOTE 
Inflammation  Score and LSR score will be recorded at each visit. BOTE should not be considered 
an AE. When LSRs are clinically significant  at the application site , the Investigator should report 
the condition as AE(s).

     At Baseline (30 min. post -dose) and Weeks 2 through Week 12 the evaluators  will rate LSRs on 
individual features including erythema, flaking/scaling, crusting, swelling, 
vesiculation/pustulation, and erosion/ulceration  using the BOTE Inflammation Score  (Section 
7.2.3 ).  
Local Skin React ion (LSR) Score s 
Clinically significant  LSRs  report ed as AEs  and/or subject reported intolerability  (i.e. itching, 
pain)  may result in an investigator -directed temporary treatment hold (drug holiday), and topical 
corticosteroids may be used to treat LSRs for up to 2 weeks. If a drug holiday is prescribed, 
Investigational product ( IP) will still be dispensed at the clinic visit to ensure the subject may 
resume dosing prior to the next clinic visit. The subject may reinitiate study drug treatment prior 
to the next scheduled visit. Upon re -initiation of study drug treatment, if a subject develops 
worsening LSRs, allergic contact dermatitis may be suspected. The investigator may take 
photographs of the suspected allergic contact dermatitis and discuss possible confirmation of 
allergic contact dermatitis with the CRO medical monitor. The investigator should also discuss 
necessity of patch testing with the subje ct/caregiver. The investigator will then discontinue the 
subject from study drug treatment and treat the area(s) with corticosteroids for up to 2 weeks. If 
the subject provides consent/assent, the investigator will consult the clinical research organizatio n 
(CRO ) medical monitor to implement the process for patch testing.  
Adverse events will be assessed and collected after the initiation of study drug treatment through 
the end of the subject’s last visit. Treatment -related adverse events will be followed u p until 
resolution or up to one year after last treatment, whichever  occurs earlier .  
Scar formation will be assessed starting at the Week 4 visit through Week 12 and again at Week 
24. The investigator will map locations of the molluscum lesions at Baselin e. Additional lesions 
identified through Week 12 will be added to the map. Using the map as a guidance, the investigator 
will assess the treated areas for scar/keloid formation. MC  lesions may resolve with pitted scars  
(indentation), and the small scars th at maintain original MC size (<5 mm) and less than 1 mm in 
depth will heal over time. Any pitted scars <5 mm in diameter and <1 mm in depth will not be 
considered AEs since these are considered part of the normal healing process. . If a scar is larger 
than 5 mm in diameter or greater than 1 mm in depth, this will be considered an adverse event for 
the purposes of this study. In addition, keloid/hypertrophic scars will also be recorded as adverse 
events.   
If a subject’s treatment is discontinued by the inve stigator or the subject because of an AE, that 
AE should be indicated as the reason for treatment discontinuation. All subjects will be encouraged 
to remain in the study throughout the 24 -week study duration.

     In the event of suspected allergic contact derm atitis, photographs may be taken of the affected 
area(s) and transmitted to the CRO medical monitor for review prior to initiating patch testing.  
When approximately 200 subjects (cumulative across studies NI-MC302  and NI-MC302 ) have 
completed 4 weeks of treatment, a Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will review all available 
unblinded safety data (including completed patch testing  results ).

5.4 Subject Screening  
Written informed consent (assent form where required) will be obtained before any study -related 
procedures are performed. The investigator  may discuss the study and the possibility for entry with 
a potential subject without first obtainin g consent. A subject wishing to participate must give 
written informed consent /assent  prior to any study -related procedures being conducted, including 
those performed solely for the purpose of determining eligibility for study participation or 
withdrawal f rom current medication (if required prior to study entry). The investigator  has both 
the ethical and legal responsibility to ensure that each subject being considered for inclusion in 
this study has been given a full explanation of the procedures and expec tations for study 
participation.  
The site -specific informed consent forms  (ICF) /assent forms  must be forwarded to the contract  
research organization ( CRO ) for approval prior to submission to an Institutional Review Board 
(IRB) and/or Independent Ethics Co mmittee (IEC) as appropriate. Each subject will sign the ICF 
that has been approved by the same IRB responsible for protocol approval. Each ICF/assent  form 
Page 35/70
16.1.1 Protocol NI -MC30 1   
Novan: A Phase 3 Molluscum Contagiosum Efficacy and Safety Study  Confidential  
SB206/Berdazimer Sodium Gel  Page 35 of 69 
 
 
    
    
     must adhere to the ethical principles stated in the Declaration of Helsinki and will include the 
elements required by Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations in 21 CFR as well as the 
International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines, and 
applicable federal and local regulatory requirements. The ICF/assent  form (s) must also include a 
statement that Novan and the CRO (or their designees) and auditing regulatory agencies will have 
direct access to the subject’s records and medical history.  
Once the appropriate essential information has been provided to the subjec t/caregiver  and fully 
explained by the investigator  (or a qualified designee) and it is felt that the subject /caregiver  
understands the implications and risks of participating in the study, the IRB approved ICF/assent  
document shall be signed and dated by both the subject /caregiver  and the person obtaining consent 
(investigator  or designee), and by any other parties required by the IRB or other regulatory 
authorities. The subject /caregiver  will be given a copy of the signed ICF/assent  document with the 
original kept on file by the investigator . All of the above activities must be completed before any 
study related procedures are conducted.  
5.4.1  Screening Failures  
A subject is considered screened once they have a signed ICF /assent  and completed one screening 
asses sment. A screen failure subject will be any screened subject who does not get randomized to 
a treatment arm.  Subjects will be allowed to rescreen  once . 
5.5 Deviation from Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria  
Deviation from the Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria is not allowed.  Any deviation identified during 
the study should be discussed with the CRO and/or Novan . 
6 STUDY CONDUCT  
6.1 General Instructions  
Prospective subjects as defined by the eligibility criteria (Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria) will be 
considered for entry int o this study. Subjects’ ICF/assent  must be obtained prior to conducting any 
procedures. Some Baseline procedures (i.e., review of inclusion/exclusion criteria, brief physical 
exam, adverse event assessment, concomitant medication review, and UPT) must be c ompleted 
prior to randomization. Subjects who meet all eligibility criteria who do not require washout from 
any current treatment may be screened and randomized on the same day.  
After the required procedures are completed and study eligibility is confirmed, the subject will be  
randomized to treatment utilizing an Interactive Web Response System (IWRS) which will  
identify the study drug to be dispensed to the subject. The subject/caregiver will be trained on the

6.3 Discontinuation  
6.3.1  Treatment Discontinuation  
If at any time during the study the investigator  determines that it is not in the best interest of the 
subject to continue treatment, the subject’s treatment will be discontinued . The investigator  can 
discontinue the treatment for a subject at any time if medically necessary. If a subject’s treatment 
is permanently discontinued by the investigator  because of an AE, that AE should be indicated as 
the reason for treatment discontinu ation. In this case, the subject is discontinued from the 
treatment , but still participates in the study and the subject is encouraged to follow the visit  
schedule and complete all assessments.  
In addition, the investigator  may instruct the subject to temporarily halt  treatment of a specified 
region (i.e. , due to an adverse event). This treatment modification and the reason for the temporary 
drug interruption should be documented in the subject’s source documents  and eCRF . The lesions 
in the impacted area should continue to be counted in the lesion count during the  period of  
treatment modification.  
The investigator  may discontinue a subject’s treatment if the subject/caregiver has failed to follow 
study procedures or to keep follow -up appointments. Appropr iate documentation in the subject’s 
study record and the study database regarding the reason for treatment discontinuation must be 
completed.  
Reasons for an investigator ’s withdrawal of a subject from the treatment  may include, but are 
not limited to, the following:  
• Safety (e.g., sever e adverse reactions, pregnancy)  
Page 41/70
16.1.1 Protocol NI -MC30 1   
Novan: A Phase 3 Molluscum Contagiosum Efficacy and Safety Study  Confidential  
SB206/Berdazimer Sodium Gel  Page 41 of 69 
 
 
    
    
     • When a concomitant medication or treatment likely to interfere with the results of the study 
is reported, or required, by the subject , the investigator  will decide, in consultation with the 
CRO whether the subject is to be withdrawn . 
Reason(s) for discontinuation from the treatment as listed in the study record will be entered into 
the study database as follows:  
• Completed (complete clearance prior to Wee k 12) 
• Adverse Event  (including LSRs  deemed to be significant by investigator)  
• Withdrawal by Subject/ Caregiver  
• Physician Decision  
• Protocol Violation  
• Lost to Follow -Up 
• Pregnancy  
• Lack of Efficacy  
• Worsening of Molluscum Contagiosum  
• Other  
6.3.2  Study Discontinuation  
A subject /caregiver  may voluntarily withdraw from study participation at any time. If the 
subject /caregiver withdraws consent and discontinues from the study, the investigator  will attempt 
to determine the reason for discontinuation and record the reason i n the subject’s study records 
and in the study database. In the event of discontinuation  from the study , (i.e., prior to Week 
12/ET 1) every effort  should be made to have the subject return to the study center to complete the 
Week 12 evaluations  (ET1  visit). Subjects who withdraw from the study will not be replaced.  
Subjects who discontinue from the study after Week 12 but prior to Week 24 will be asked to 
return to the study center  to complete the Week 24 evaluations  (ET2 visit) . 
All subjects who fail to re turn to the study center will be contacted by  telephone to determine the 
reason(s) why the subject failed to return for the necessary visit or  elected to discontinue from the 
study. If a subject /caregiver  is unreachable by telephone after a minimum of  two documented 
attempts (one attempt on two different days), a certified letter will be sent  requesting that the

SB206/Berdazimer Sodium Gel  Page 42 of 69 
 
 
    
    
     subject contacts  the investigator . These actions will be reported on the subject’s study record  and 
a copy of the follow -up letter maintained in the investigator 's file.  
An investigator  may withdraw a subject from the study  when a subject is lost to follow -up.   
All premature discontinuations and their causes must be carefully documented in the subj ect’s 
study record and in the study database.  
All Week 12 or Week 24 evaluations should be performed at the time of premature discontinuation  
as applicable . All data gathered on the subject prior to termination will be made available to the  
CRO.  The invest igative site should make all reasonable efforts to ensure the subject returns to 
complete the appropriate termination  visit, even if the subject is not able to attend other study 
visits.  
Study completion or reason(s) for discontinuation  from the study  as listed in the study record will 
be entered into  the study database as follows:  
• Completed  Treatment Per Investigator’s Instructions and Completed All Study Visits  
• Withdrawal by Subject /Caregiver  
• Lost to Follow -Up 
Novan has the right to terminate or stop the study at any time. Should this be necessary, the  
investigator  will ensure that proper study discontinuation procedures are completed.  
7 DESCRIPTION OF STUDY  PROCEDURES  
Study procedures and their timings are summarized in the Schedule of Assessments  (refer to Table 
1). 
7.1 Efficacy Assessments  
7.1.1  Molluscum Contagiosum  Lesion Counts  
Molluscum contagiosum  is a viral infection characterized by small, discrete,  waxy, skin -colored , 
dome -shaped papules, an average of 3 –5 mm in diameter. The papules may be  umbilicated and 
contain a caseous plug.  When the lesions are squeezed or traumatized , a creamy, grey -white 
material can be extruded.  If the investigator cannot clearly differentiate the lesions  as is the case 
for agminated (clustered lesions))  this should be count ed as one  lesion . If the investigator can 
differentiate and count the umbilical tops separately,  each lesion should be counted separately. The 
Page 43/70
16.1.1 Protocol NI -MC30 1   
Novan: A Phase 3 Molluscum Contagiosum Efficacy and Safety Study  Confidential  
SB206/Berdazimer Sodium Gel  Page 43 of 69 
 
 
    
    
     investigator should be consistent with the method of recording agminated lesions throughout the 
study . 
For the purpose of this clinical trial , only active MC lesions are  counted . Treatable lesions are any 
active (raised, palpable ) MC lesion s that are dome -shaped, pearly and shiny white top centered 
papules that are at least 2 cm away from the ocular region.  
All study personnel who will perform lesion counts must pass the study training including lesion 
count training. Training on how to acc urately count  the number of MC lesions  will be provided .  
Mapping of lesions:  At every visit from Baseline through Week 12 , all lesions should be recorded 
on the body map  and will clearly note the location of each lesion or agminated lesion. The lesion 
map is intended to  assist study personnel in performing lesion counting  and scar/keloid  assessment . 
Definition of Clearance : For the purpose of this study, “c lear” means  resolution of the active 
(raised, palpable) treatable molluscum lesion (s). After resolution, the residual surface changes 
such as pitted scar (indentation) < 1 mm in depth at the molluscum lesion area (<5 mm in diameter), 
hyper or hypopigmentation may remain. As these are considered part of the normal healing, they 
will not be ca ptured as adverse events. Refer to the lesion count training for details.  
The same evaluator should perform lesion counts at Screening, Baseline, and Weeks 2, 4, 8 and 
12/ET 1. In the event that this is not possible due to unforeseen circumstances, a differ ent evaluator 
may evaluate the subject. The evaluator must pass the study training including lesion count 
training. It is particularly important to ensure the same evaluator performs  the Baseline and Week 
12/ET1  for lesion count for a subject  and also Base line and Week 24 /ET2  assessment for 
scarring/keloid  scarring . 
7.1.2  Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI)  
The Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI ) questionnaire is designed for use in adults  (i.e., 
subjects aged 16 years and above) . The questions are designed to be completed  with a one week 
recall period.  It is self-explanatory  and can be simply handed to the subject who is asked to fill it 
in without the need for detailed explanation. It is usually completed in one to two minutes.  The 
Children’s Dermatology Life Quality Index (CDLQI) questionnaire is the DLQI that is adapted 
for use in children (i.e. , subjects from age 4 up to age 16).  
Both the DLQI and the  CDLQI are calculated by summing the score of each question resulting in 
a maximum score of 30 and a minimum  score  of 0.

     7.2 Safety Assessments  
7.2.1  Physical Exam  
A brief p hysical examination will be performed to evaluat e objective anatomic findings . This 
physical examination will be performed at Baseline and  at Week 12/ET 1. Any clinically significant 
changes in the physical exam from baseline will be recorded as AEs. 
7.2.2  Pregnancy Testing  
Urine pregnancy testing for females 9 years of age and older will b e collected at Screening, 
Baseline, Week 4, Week 8 and Week 12/ET 1. In addition to having a negative UPT at Baseline , 
before the first application of study drug, females 9 years of age and older must be willing to use 
an acceptable form of birth control du ring the study. The following are considered acceptable 
methods of birth control for this study: abstinence with a documented acceptable method of birth 
control if the subject becomes sexually active, oral contraceptives, contraceptive patches, 
contracepti ve implant, vaginal contraceptive, double -barrier methods (e.g., condom and 
spermicide), contraceptive injection, Intrauterine Device (IUD), hormonal IUD, permanent 
contraception, same sex partner or partner who has had a vasectomy. Tubal ligation is not 
considered to be surgical sterilization; women with tubal ligations will be required to complete 
UPTs at the required timepoints.  
7.2.3  BOTE Inflammation Score  
Inflammatory reactions around the MC has been associated with imminent resolution of MC 
(sometimes refe rred to as “beginning -of-the-end” [“BOTE”] sign s). In most cases, clinical features 
can differentiate between BOTE and LSR. BOTE may be associated with itch ing, but not pain. 
BOTE is usually asymptomatic, self -limited, localized to individual MC lesions, a nd does not 
require discontinuation of study treatment or additional treatment.  
Investigators will assess the treatment area at each scheduled visit and use their medical judgement 
to differentiate between BOTE and LSRs. The BOTE Inflammation  Score will b e recorded at each 
visit. BOTE should not be considered an AE  since this is part of normal disease progression .

Assessment  Description  
0 No inflammation  No evidence of local inflammation  
1 Mild  Minimal erythema and/or edema  
2 Moderate  Definite erythema and/or edema with or 
without hemorrhagic crusting  
3 Severe  Erythema and edema with definite 
hemorrhagic crusting  
4 Very Severe  Strong reaction spreading beyond the 
treated area, bullous reaction, erosions  
7.2.4  Local Skin Reaction Score  
The investigator (or designated evaluator) will assess localized skin reactions (LSRs) at Baseline 
(at least 30 minutes post -dose), and at Weeks 2 , 4, 8 and  12. The individual components of LSRs 
are scored separately  on a scale of 0 -4, with higher numbers indicating more severe reactions. The 
individual components include erythema , flaking/scaling, crusting, swelling, 
vesiculation/pustulation, and erosion/ulcerati on. 
 
Compared to BOTE, LSR is generally more diffuse, associated with significant itch or tenderness, 
may necessitate discontinuation of study treatment and may need treatment for symptomatic relief 
(e.g. a topical corticosteroid or topical anesthetic). Fo r very severe LSR, systemic corticosteroids 
may be considered.  
Investigators will assess the treatment area at each scheduled visit and use their medical judgement 
to differentiate between BOTE a nd LSRs. When LSRs are clinically significant  in the opinion of 
the investigator , s/he should report the condition as an AE(s)  (e.g. application site erythema, 
application site edema) . 
In the event of an LSR, the investigator may choose to initiate a drug holiday for the  study drug  
for up to 2 weeks ; treatment with corticosteroids may be ordered during the drug holiday at the 
investigator’s discretion . For very severe LSR, systemic corticosteroids may be considered. The 
subject should be instructed how many days to hold study drug and site staff should  phone the

     subject on the planned day of resuming study drug to ensure that the LSR has resolved. If the LSR 
has not resolved , the drug holiday may be extended as long as the total period of withholding study 
drug does not exceed 2 weeks. If the LSR has re solved, the subject may resume treatment . If the 
LSR flares again after re -introduction of study drug, allergic contact dermatitis may be suspected . 
The subject may again be treated with up to 2 weeks of corticosteroid s.  
If allergic contact dermatitis is suspected, study drug should be discontinued permanently and an 
AE of allergic contact dermatitis should be recorded as the reason for discontinuation. Week 
12/ET 1 assessments should be completed at the time of discontinuation, but the subject should 
conti nue in the study and complete study -related visits through Week 24.  
Patch testing (see  Section  7.2.5  and Section 20.2) should  be offered to the subject.

7.2.5  Patch Testing  
In the event that a subject has an LSR that is felt to be suggestive of allergic contact dermatitis, 
patch testing may be initiated to confirm.  This should be offered to the subject/caregiver. If th e 
subject/caregiver consents to patch testing and once the LSR has been completely resolved  for a 
period of 2 weeks and up to 2 months, patch testing will commence . Novan will provide the patch 
testing instruction once requested from the CRO medical monito r. Additional drug product for 
Page 47/70

     patch testing may be supplied through I WRS if the currently assigned subject’s investigational 
product has been assignment was > than 60 days of the patch testing date(s).  
If allergic contact dermatitis is suspected, study dr ug should be discontinued permanently and an 
AE of allergic contact dermatitis should be recorded as the reason for discontinuation. Week 
12/ET 1 assessments should be completed at the time of discontinuation, but the subject should 
continue to participate  in the study and complete study related visits through Wee k 24.  
In the event of suspected allergic contact dermatitis, photographs may be taken of the affected 
area(s) and transmitted to the CRO medical monitor for review prior to initiating patch testing.  
See Section 20.2 for further information.  
7.2.6  Scarring /Keloid  Assessment  
Scar formation will be assessed starting at the Week 4 visit through Week 12 , and again at Week 
24. For the purposes of  this study, scar is d efined as follows: pitted scars  with ≥ 5 mm in diameter 
or ≥ 1 mm in depth, and hypertrophic/keloid scars  originated from MC lesion.  Pitted scars < 5 
mm in diameter and < 1 mm in depth  originated from MC lesion  are considered part of normal 
healing proces s and will not be captured as AEs .   
7.3 Protocol Deviations  
This study will be conducted as described in this protocol, except for in emergency situation s in 
which the protection, safety, and well -being of the subject requires immediate intervention, based  
on the judgment of the investigator  (or a responsible, appropriately trained professional designated  
by the investigator ). In the event of a significant deviation from the protocol due to an emergency,  
accident, or mistake, the investigator  or designee must contact the CRO at the earliest possible  
time by telephone. This will allow an early joint decision regarding the subject’s continuation in  
the study. This decision will be documented by the investigator  and the CRO.

     8 STUDY DRUG MANAGEMEN T 
8.1 Description  
8.1.1  Formulation  
Investigational Drug: SB206 12% Comparator Drug: Vehicle Gel  
Dosing:  
Up to a pproximately 2mL  of SB206  QD Dosing:  
Up to a pproximately 2mL  of Vehicle Gel QD 
8.1.2  Storage  
Upon receipt from Novan, or Novan’s designee, a study staff member will place all study supplies 
in a refrigerated temperature -controlled and monitored area. The SB206/Vehicle study product 
should be refrigerated  (2-8°C/36 -46°F) until dispensed.  
Access to study supplies should be strictly limited to the study staff. Neither the investigator  nor 
any member of the study staff will distribute any of the study supplies to any person not 
participating in this study.  
If a study staff member becomes aware that the study supplies have not been properly handled 
(i.e., supply arrives and was not placed in refrigerator upon receipt  or there is a temperature 
excursion during shipment ), the CRO must be contacted immediately. In  such an event, study 
supplies should be quarantined and not be administered to any subject until Novan or Novan’s 
designee provides further direction.  
It is expected that the site staff will maintain refrigerator temperature logs in the refrigerated study 
drug storage area, recording the temperature at least once each working day. Excursions in 
temperature during storage should be discussed with the CRO immediately and study supplies 
should be quarantined and not administered until Novan provides approval for use. Other supplies 
will be stored at room temperature.  
The study drug will be dispensed at the discretion of and by the direction of the designated study 
personnel in accordance with the conditions specified in this protocol. It is t he investigator ’s 
responsibility to ensure that accurate records of study drug dispensing and return are maintained.

     8.2 Packaging and Shipment  
Novan, or designee, will provide all study drug to the sites.  Sites are required to maintain all 
records of shipment  and receipt in the Investigator  Site File.  
8.3 Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups  
In this  randomized , double -blind, vehicle -controlled  study, subjects who meet study entry criteria 
will be randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio (active: vehicle) . The randomization schedule will be 
computer generated using a permuted block algorithm and will randomly allocate IP to 
randomization numbers. The randomization numbers will be assigned sequentially through a 
central  IWRS as subjects are entered into the study . At randomization, subjects will be stratified 
into four strata corresponding to the cross -classification of household number of randomized 
subjects (1 subject per household vs 2 subjects per household) and  investigator type (dermatologist 
vs other).   Households randomizing 2 subjects would receive the same treatment assignment for 
both subjects.  Approximately 340 subjects, 6 months of years of age and older, with a minimum 
of 3 and a maximum of 70 lesions at Baseline will be randomized.  
8.4 Blinding and Unblinding Treatment Assignment  
All subjects, investigator s, and study personnel involved in the conduct of the study will be blinded 
to treatment assignment, with the exception of a specified unblinded statistician who will generate 
and have access to the  randomization code. The unblinded study personnel will not otherwise 
participate in study procedures or data analysis prior to unblinding of the study data to all study 
related personnel.  
When approximately 200 subjects (cumulative across studies NI-MC302  and NI-MC302 ) have  
completed 4 weeks of treatment , a DSMB will review all available unblinded safety data  
(including patch testing) . Personnel who are not otherwise involved in the study will prepare the 
unblinde d data and summary tables for t his analysis .  
Study personnel will endeavor to safeguard the integrity of the study blind to minimize bias in the 
conduct of the study. Individual t reatment unblinding is discouraged since knowledge of the 
treatment assignme nt will not materially change the planned management of a medical emergency. 
Unblinding should be discussed in advance with the medical monitor if possible. Study personnel 
will utilize the IWRS for emergency unblinding . If the investigator  is not able to discuss treatment 
unblinding in advance, then he or she must notify the  CRO  medical monitor as soon as possible 
about the unblinding incident without revealing the subject’s treatment assignment. The 
investigator  or designee must record the date and reason for study discontinuation on the 
appropriate eCRF for that subject. In all cases that are not emergencies, the investigator  must 
discuss the event with the medical monitor prior to unblinding the subject’s treat ment assignment.

SB206/Berdazimer Sodium Gel  Page 50 of 69 
 
 
    
    
     If treatment assignment is unblinded for an individual subject, study personnel will be notified of 
that subject’s treatment assignment without unblinding the treatment assignments for the 
remaining subjects in the study. Thus, the overal l study blind will not be compromised. If a 
subject’s treatment assignment is unblinded, he or she may or may not be asked to withdraw from 
the study. The investigator  will make this decision after consultation with the medical monitor.  
8.5 Dose and Administra tion 
Subjects will apply treatment once  daily  for up to 12 weeks to all active lesions identified at 
baseline and new lesions that arise during treatment  If the investigator determines all lesions are 
cleared at a clinic visit, the treatment may stop. If t reatment is stopped due to clearance, subjects 
will continue regularly scheduled visits through Week 24 /ET2 . 
An increase in  the number of MC lesions (with or without inflammatory reaction) during the early 
treatment phase is often observed. It is important  to instruct the subject/caregiver to treat the new 
lesions as well as the existing lesions.  
Each dose will consist of berdazimer  gel or vehicle gel with hydrogel thoroughly mixed together 
by the subject or caregiver and applied to the lesions  and approxim ately 1 cm surrounding each 
lesion . Periocular lesions will be treated if the lesions are at least 2 cm from the edge of the eye . If 
a subject has more than 20 MC, a second dose of berdazimer gel or vehicle gel with hydrogel can 
be prepared to ensure appropriate coverage of all lesions.    
At the investigator’s discretion, the subject may be placed on a drug holiday for up to 2 weeks at 
a time in the event of a significant local skin reaction  (LSR) . This will be captured in the electronic 
data capture ( EDC ) system and the subject’s diary. The investigator should instruct the subject 
how long to hold study drug and the planned date to re -start treatment. Site staff should contact 
the subject on the day of the planned re -start and assess whether the LSR ha s resolved enough to 
resume treatment. If it has not resolved sufficiently, the drug holiday may be extended as long as 
the entire extension has not exceeded 2 weeks.  If the LSR flares after re -introduction of study drug, 
the study drug should be permanent ly discontinued and the EDC system updated appropriately.  
Please see Section 7.2.4  for additional information.  
8.6 Accountability  
The dispensing and return of all study dru g will be recorded on a dispensing log. The subject 
number/initials, and the initials and date of the person dispensing and receiving the returned 
medication will be documented on this form.  All study product will be weighed at the time it is 
dispensed and  when it is returned. The tube weights will be recorded in the electronic case report 
form ( eCRF ).

     Inventory records must be readily available for inspection by the trial monitor and/or auditor, and 
open to government inspection at any time.  
Study drug returned by subjects at will be held on site until accountability has been completed. 
The site will be instructed on return or destruction of used and unused clinical supplies.  
8.7 Prohibited Concomitant Medication/ Therapy  
Any medication/therapy use d by the subject following first application of study product will be 
considered a concomitant medication (e.g., aspirin, acetaminophen, birth control pills, vitamins, 
etc.). Every attempt should be made to keep concomitant medication/therapy dosing consta nt 
during the study. Any change to concomitant medications/therapies should be noted on the 
subject’s study record and in the study database. When applicable, an AE should be completed for 
any subject starting a concomitant medication/therapy after enrollm ent into the study.  
Immunosuppressive treatment  is prohibited during the study. Use of topical calcineurin inhibitors 
or steroids on MC or within 2 cm of MC lesions is prohibited within 14 days of baseline and during 
the study. Use of the following concomi tant medications to treat MC 14 days prior to baseline and 
during the study is prohibited: podophyllotoxin, imiquimod, cantharidin, sinecatechins, topical 
retinoids, oral or topical zinc, other homeopathic or over-the-counter products including, but not 
limited to, ZymaDerm  and tea tree oil, cimetidine and other histamine H2 receptor  antagonists . 
Surgical procedures to treat MC (cryotherapy, curettage, other)  are prohibited during the study . 
8.8 Compliance  
Subjects will be provided a diary to record dose s. Revi ew of subject compliance will be conducted 
at each visit and missed doses recorded on the subject diary will be recorded on the eCRF .   
No reconciliation will be performed on the diary compliance against the tube weights. Subject 
compliance will be based on calculation from the missed doses recorded from the subject diary 
only.  
9 ADVERSE EVENTS  
Adverse events will be assessed and collected after the initiation of study drug treatment through 
the end of the subject’s last visit. In order to avoid bias in eliciting AEs, subjects /caregivers  should 
be asked the following non -leading question: “ How ha ve you felt  since your last visit? ” Adverse 
events will be assessed and r eported after the subject is dosed, beginning from B aseline  through  
the end of the subject’s last visit . SAEs will be collected from the time of consent through the end 
of the subject ’s last visit. Adverse events that occur from time of consent up to the time of treatment 
administration should be recorded as medical history for all participants. Treatment -related

     adverse events will be followed up until resolution or up to one year aft er last treatment, whichever  
occurs earlier . 
9.1 Documenting Adverse Events  
All AEs (serious and non -serious) reported by the subject must be recorded on the subject’s study 
record and entered into the study database  no later than 5 days of the site’s first kn owledge . The 
site must report related SAEs to the Sponsor within 24 hours after first knowledge of the event by 
the study site. The date of onset, date ended, accurate event term, seriousness, severity, outcome, 
relationship to study drug, therapy required , and action taken regarding study drug and study 
participation will be reported for each AE.  
Significant LSRs (as judged by the investigator) and scarring (pitted scars ≥ 1mm in depth), scars 
that are larger than the original MC and/or extend outside the treatment area, and 
hypertrophic/keloid scars will be captured as adverse events.  
9.2 Assessment of Severity  
The investigator  is responsible for evaluating all AEs and determining the severity of the event.  
Severity will be categorized according to the following d efinitions:  
• Mild:  Event may be noticeable to subject; does not influence daily activities; usually does 
not require  intervention  
• Moderate:  Event may be of sufficient severity to make subject uncomfortable; 
performance of daily activities may be influen ced; intervention may be needed  
• Severe:  Event may cause severe discomfort; usually interferes with daily activities; subject 
may not be able to continue in the study; treatment or other intervention usually needed  
The investigator  will follow all subjects who experience AEs as described in  Section 9.4. 
9.3 Assessment of Causality  
Relationship of each AE to study drug  must be assessed .  
Several factors should be considered when assessing the relationship (causality) of an event to the 
study drug or administration of the study drug.  
• Alterna tive etiology – Is the event due to an underlying disease/condition being treated or 
to another known, underlying disease/condition of the participant?  
Page 53/70
16.1.1 Protocol NI -MC30 1   
Novan: A Phase 3 Molluscum Contagiosum Efficacy and Safety Study  Confidential  
SB206/Berdazimer Sodium Gel  Page 53 of 69 
 
 
    
    
     • Known relationship – Has the event been observed before in participants treated with this 
product or similar products?  
• Temporal relationship – Is there a reasonable temporal relationship between the time of 
onset for the event and the administration of the study drug?  
• Concomitant medication – Is the event a known side effect of a concomitant medication?  
Per the Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences (CIOMS) VI working group, 
the use of “cannot -be-ruled -out” to imply drug relatedness will lead to excessive over -reporting 
and excess noise in the system. It is virtually impossible to comp letely rule out the role of a drug 
in causing an adverse event in single -case reporting. Differentiating from the procedural causes 
may also be difficult. Hence, the review of aggregated controlled data is an important component 
for the determination of th e safety profile of any investigation product. Aggregate review is 
completed by the Sponsor.  
Therefore, given the above, the Investigator should assess the relatedness to the study drug using 
a standard of a reasonable possibility of a causal relationship between the study drug and the AE, 
as per the examples in the table below:  
 
Assessment of Causality  
Reasonable possibility: classification 
includes definitely, probably (likely), 
possibly related events  • Reasonable temporal sequence to drug 
administration  
• Event can be fully attributable to 
administration of the study drug  
• Known pharmacological action of the study 
drug 
• Specific tests available (positive allergy test, 
antibodies, metabolites)  
• As adverse drug reaction in the product 
information (Investigator’s  Brochure)  
• Reported in the literature as a possible side 
effect  
• Dechallenge (event abates on discontinuation 
of the study drug/without treatment)  
• Rechallenge positive (event reappears on re -
exposure to study drug)  
Page 54/70
16.1.1 Protocol NI -MC30 1   
Novan: A Phase 3 Molluscum Contagiosum Efficacy and Safety Study  Confidential  
SB206/Berdazimer Sodium Gel  Page 54 of 69 
 
 
    
    
     • Not explained otherwise by the subject’s 
clinical state or medical history or by other 
concomitant agents/therapies, etc.  
No reasonable possibility: 
classification includes definitely not, 
probably not, unlikely related events  • No reasonable temporal sequ ence to study 
drug administration  
• Event is explained by a number of other factors 
such as a subject’s clinical state, medical 
history or other concomitant agents/therapies  
• Etiology has been clarified and is in no way 
related to the study drug  
• No reason for  suspecting a causal relationship 
to the study drug and  
• Investigators have established this beyond 
reasonable doubt  
The causal relationship will be recorded on a binary scale by answering yes or no the following 
questions: is there a reasonable possibility of a causal relationship between the study drug and the 
AE? The phrase “reasonable causal relationship” means to co nvey, in general, that there are facts, 
evidence or argument that support a causal relationship to the study drug.   
9.4 Adverse Event Follow -up 
9.4.1  Follow -Up of Non -Serious Adverse Events  
Non-serious AEs that are not resolved at the time of the last scheduled study visit (Week 24/ET2) 
must be recorded in the study database as ongoing/not recovered/not resolved. No further follow -
up will occur for any AEs that are not related to the study dr ug unless this is required by a health 
authority or the Medical Monitor.   
Treatment related adverse events, including LSRs, pitted scars ≥  5 mm in diameter or ≥ 1mm in 
depth originated from MC lesion and hypertrophic scars/keloid, will be followed up unt il 
resolution or up to 1 year after last treatment, whichever is sooner.  
9.4.2  Follow -Up of Post Study Serious Adverse Events  
Serious adverse events that are identified on t he last scheduled contact (Week 24/ET2) must be 
recorded in the study database and repor ted to the CRO  according to the reporting procedures 
outlined in  Section  10. This may include unresolved previously reported SAEs, or new SAEs. The 
investigator  should  follow these SAEs until the events are resolved, or the subject is lost to follow -
Page 55/70
16.1.1 Protocol NI -MC30 1   
Novan: A Phase 3 Molluscum Contagiosum Efficacy and Safety Study  Confidential  
SB206/Berdazimer Sodium Gel  Page 55 of 69 
 
 
    
    
     up. The investigator should continue to report any significant follow -up information to the Sponsor 
and the IRB up to the point the event has been resolved. Resolution means  the subject has returned 
to the baseline state of health, or the investigator does not expect any further improvement or 
worsening of the subject’s condition.  
9.5 Pregnancy  
Females 9 years of age and older  must use an effective method of birth control during the course 
of the study and for 30 days following their final study visit. The following are considered 
acceptable methods of birth control for this study: abstinence with a documented acceptable 
method of birth control if the subject becomes sexually active, oral contraceptives, contraceptive 
patches, contraceptive implant, vaginal contraceptive, double -barrier methods (e.g., condom and 
spermicide), contraceptive injection, Intrauterine Device (IUD), hor monal IUD, permanent 
contraception, same sex partner or partner who has had a vasectomy. Tubal ligation is not 
considered to be surgical sterilization; women with tubal ligations will be required to complete 
UPTs at the required timepoints.  
A female is con sidered to be of childbearing potential unless she is post -menopausal (no menses 
for 24 consecutive months), surgically sterilized (documented hysterectomy, documented bilateral 
salpingectomy, documented bilateral oophorectomy)  or under 9 years of age . Tub al ligation does 
not meet the definition of surgically sterile.  
Before enrolling any subject in this clinical trial, the Investigator must review guidelines about 
study participation including the topics below:  
• Informed consent document  
• Pregnancy preventio n information  
• Risks to unborn child(ren)  
• Any drug interactions with hormonal contraceptives  
• Contraceptives in current use  
• Guidelines for the follow -up of a reported pregnancy  
Prior to study enrollment, all subjects must be advised of the importance of avoiding pregnancy 
during participation in this clinical study and the potential risk factors for an unintentional 
pregnancy. The subject must sign an informed consent document stating that the above -mentioned 
risk factors and the consequence s were discussed.  
Page 56/70
16.1.1 Protocol NI -MC30 1   
Novan: A Phase 3 Molluscum Contagiosum Efficacy and Safety Study  Confidential  
SB206/Berdazimer Sodium Gel  Page 56 of 69 
 
 
    
    
     During the study, females 9 years of age and older  should be instructed to contact the investigator 
immediately if they suspect they might be pregnant (e.g., missed or late menstrual cycle). Study 
drug shall be held immediately if a subje ct is suspected to be pregnant and study drug must be 
permanently discontinued if pregnancy is confirmed. The Investigator must immediately notify 
the medical monitor/CRO of any female subject who becomes pregnant any time during study 
participation, recor d the information on the pregnancy notification form and email the form to the 
CRO. Subjects found to be pregnant prior to Week 12 will stop study drug treatment, continue 
with study visits  through Week 24 and follow up with pregnancy outcome. Beyond Week 24, the 
site should follow -up with the subject periodically during the pregnancy for ongoing health and 
safety information through the end of the pregnancy, as applicable. The investigator is responsible 
for following the pregnancy through the end of the p regnancy and for providing the assessment of 
the healthy live birth or for reporting any abnormal  outcome such as stillbirth, miscarriage, or 
deformity to the CRO/Sponsor (Note: Congenital anomaly/birth defect / etc. are considered SAEs 
and require separat e reporting per  Section  10.) 
9.6 Overdose  
There is no specific antidote for SB206 .  In the event of an overdose, best supportive care should 
be utilized. Methylene blue may be used to treat subjec ts exhibiting methemoglobinemia . The 
Medical Monitor/CRO/Sponsor must be notified of any subject exhibiting signs of 
methemoglobinemia.  
10 SERIOUS ADVERSE EVEN T 
10.1 Definition of Serious Adverse Event  
A SAE is any event that meets any o f the following criteria:  
• Death  
 
• Life-threatening  event  (i.e., the subject was at immediate risk of death from the event as it 
occurred. It  does not include a reaction that if it had occurred in a more serious form might 
have caused death. For example, dru g induced hepatitis that resolved without evidence of 
hepatic failure would not be considered life threatening even though drug induced hepatitis 
can be fatal. ) 
• Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  (AEs requiring 
hospitaliz ation should be considered SAEs. Hospitalization for elective surgery or routine 
clinical procedures that are not the result of AE (e.g., elective surgery for a pre -existing 
condition that has not worsened) need not be considered AEs or SAEs. If anything, 
Page 57/70
16.1.1 Protocol NI -MC30 1   
Novan: A Phase 3 Molluscum Contagiosum Efficacy and Safety Study  Confidential  
SB206/Berdazimer Sodium Gel  Page 57 of 69 
 
 
    
    
     untoward is reported during the procedure, that occurrence must be reported as an AE, 
either 'serious' or 'non -serious' according to the usual criteria. In  general, hospitalization 
signifies that the subject has been detained (usually involving at least an  overnight stay) at 
the hospital or emergency ward for observation and/or treatment that would not have been 
appropriate in the physician's office or outpatient setting. When in doubt as to whether 
'hospitalization' occurred or was necessary, the AE should  be considered serious.)  
• Persistent or significant disability/incapacity  (if the experience results in a substantial 
and/or permanent disruption of the subject's ability to carry out normal life functions)  
• Congenital anomaly/birth defect in the offspring o f a subject who received SB206  or 
Vehicle Gel  
• Other: Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospitalization, may be considered an SAE when, based upon appropriate medical 
judgment, they may jeopardize the sub ject and may require medical or surgical intervention 
to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such events are:  
− Intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home  for allergic bronchospasm  
− Blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization  
− Development of drug dependency or drug abuse  
10.2 Reporting Serious Adverse Events  
Any SAE, whether deemed drug -related or not, must be reported to the CRO as soon as possible 
after the investigator  or coordinator has become aware of its occurrence. The 
investigator /coordinator must notify the CRO  within 24 hours of notification  of the event. When 
appropriate, Novan will notify the appropriate regulatory body of drug related SAEs.   
If a subject exper iences  an SAE or pregnancy , the investigator  must:  
1. Report the SAE or pregnancy immediately  (within 24  hours) after the Investigator  becomes 
aware of the event.  
2. Complete an SAE or pregnancy notification form and send the appropriate reporting form 
to the sa fety office  within 24 ho urs of knowledge of the event.  
3. Obtain and maintain all pertinent medical records, information and medical judgments of 
medical personnel who assisted in subject’s treatment and follow -up and document as 
appropriate.  
Page 58/70
16.1.1 Protocol NI -MC30 1   
Novan: A Phase 3 Molluscum Contagiosum Efficacy and Safety Study  Confidential  
SB206/Berdazimer Sodium Gel  Page 58 of 69 
 
 
    
    
     4. Provide a more d etailed report to both the CRO  and the IRB, if applicable, no later than 
seven days after the Investigator  discovers the event as further information becomes 
available, and when necessary update the information with follow -up information 
including outcomes . This report should include a statement as to whether the event was or 
was not related to the use of study drug . 
5. The Investigator  will notify the IRB of the SAE or pregnancy according to specific IRB 
requirements.  
6. The Investigator will collect information  on SAEs until the subject’s health has returned to 
baseline  status, until all parameters have returned to normal, or remaining health issues 
have otherwise been explained.  
7. The Investigator is responsible for following pregnancies through the end of the pr egnancy 
and for providing the assessment of the healthy live birth or for reporting any abnormal 
pregnancy outcome such as stillbirth, miscarriage, or deformity to the CRO/Sponsor.  
 
For clarity on how to record an adverse event that progresses into a serious adverse event, there 
should be two events recorded: the first event would be the beginning adverse event, and the 
second event would be the serious adverse event (i.e. only the ti me the AE qualified as serious). 
Resolution of the SAE should be recorded in the same manner, two end  dates for SAE and AE, 
where the SAE and AE may or may share the same end date.   
11 STATISTICS  
11.1 General Procedures  
The study treatment period is defined from randomization through completion of Week 12/ET1 
visit and the safety follow -up period is from the completion of Week 12 through the completion 
of Week 24/ET2 visit.  
After all subjects have completed their Week 12/ET1 visit, thus completing the Treatment Pe riod 
of the study, the database through Week 12/ET1 will be frozen and unblinded for purposes of the 
primary analysis of efficacy and safety.  While this analysis is being prepared, the subjects will 
continue through Week 24/ET2. After all subjects have co mpleted their Week 24/ET2 visit, the 
database will be locked and the follow -up data will be analyzed. Prior to unblinding and the 
primary analysis of efficacy and safety , a detailed, finalized SAP will be completed and placed on 
file. The Statistical Analy sis Plan will contain a more comprehensive explanation than that 
provided here of the methodology used in the statistical analyses, as well as the rules and data 
handling conventions used to perform the analyses and the procedure used to account for missin g 
data.  
Page 59/70
16.1.1 Protocol NI -MC30 1

SB206/Berdazimer Sodium Gel  Page 59 of 69 
 
 
    
    
     Safety and efficacy endpoints will be displayed using descriptive statistics and graphical displays , 
where applicable . For categorical variables, frequencies, and percentages will be presented. The 
denominator for  percentage will be based on the nu mber of subjects appropriate for the purpose of 
analysis.  Continuous variables will be summarized using descriptive statistics (number of subjects,  
mean, median, standard deviation [SD], minimum, and maximum). Where relevant, 95% 
confidence intervals will be calculated.  Any statistical tests will be conducted at the 0.05 
significance level using 2 -tailed tests, and nominal p -values will be reported.  
11.2 Sample Size  
Approximately 340 subjects, 6 months of  years  of age and older , with a minimum of 3 and a 
maximum of 70 lesions at Baseline will be randomized in a 2:1 (active:vehicle) scheme . The 
sample size assumptions for this study were informed by the completed Phase 2 study NI -MC201 of 
subjects ≥2 years of age with 3 -70 MC les ions at Baseline.  In the ITT population of the Phase 2 
study, the observed rates of clearance at Week 12 were 18% (12/66) for vehicle and 38% (18/48) 
for SB206 12% once daily (QD) and the covariate -adjusted treatment difference was 18%.  
A sample size of 340 subjects (227 subjects in the SB206 12% QD group and 113 subjects in the 
vehicle group) will provide 94% power for a 2 -sided alpha test of size 0.05 to detect an absolute 
difference of 18% when the vehicle response rate is 18%. This same sample size pr ovides 93% 
power to detect a treatment difference of 18% when the vehicle response rate is 20% and 83% 
power when the treatment difference is 15% and the vehicle response rate is 20%.  
11.3 Analysis Populations  
The analysis populations include the following:  
Safety Population:  The Safety population will consist of all subjects who receive at least one 
application of study medication.  
Intent -To-Treat Population (ITT):  The ITT population will consist of all subjects who are 
randomized.  
Per-Protocol Population (PP) : The PP population will consist of all subjects in the ITT 
population. who had no significant protocol deviations that impacted the analyses of the efficacy 
endpoints.

     12 STATISTICAL METHODS  
12.1.1  Demographic and Baseline Characteristics  
Subject demographic and Baseline characteristics will be summarized by treatment  group  for the 
SAF, ITT , and PP  populations . Relevant medical history, current medical conditions, and any other 
relevant information will be listed by subject.  
12.1.2  Effica cy Analysis  
The p rimary efficacy endpoint, proportion of subjects with complete clearance of all treatable 
molluscum lesions at Week 12 in the ITT, will be analyzed using a generalized estimating equation 
(GEE) for logistic regression  with an exchangeable working correlation structure . The model will 
include treatment, investigator type (dermatologist vs other), household number of randomized 
subjects (1 subject per household vs 2 subjects per household),  age and Baseline lesion count as 
factors. The odds ratio bet ween SB206 12% and vehicle gel, 95% CIs for the odds ratio, and P-
value for the covariate -adjusted treatment comparison  will be presented. Only subjects who 
achieve complete clearance at Week 12 will be counted as responders for the primary analysis; all 
other subjects (e.g., those who discontinue the study before achieving complete clearance) will be 
reported as failures. As a sensitivity analysis, the primary efficacy analysis will also be reported 
for the PP population.  
 
The familywise error rate with re spect to the primary endpoint and secondary endpoint will be 
strongly controlled at the alpha=0.05 level using a fixed -sequence method  testing strategy. If the 
primary endpoint is not statistically significant at the alpha=0.05 level, the secondary efficac y 
endpoint will be considered not significant. If the primary endpoint is statistically significant at 
the alpha=0.05 level, the secondary efficacy endpoint will be analyzed . 
• Proportion of all study subjects demonstrating complete clearance of all treatabl e MC at 
Week 8  
If the secondary efficacy endpoint fails to reach statistical significance at the alpha=0.05 level, it 
will be considered not statistically significant .  
The dichotomous secondary efficacy endpoint will be analyzed using the GEE  model descri bed 
for the primary efficacy endpoint. Other sensitivity analyses may be performed and will be 
specified in the SAP.  
The analyses methods to be used for the exploratory endpoints will be detailed in the SAP, 
including any additional exploratory analyses th at may be conducted. The SAP will be finalized 
before unblinding and database lock.

     12.1.3  Analysis of Safety  
12.1.3.1  Adverse Events  
All AEs that occur during the study will be recorded and classified on the basis of Medical 
Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) terminology. Treatment -emergent AEs (TEAEs) 
are defined as AEs that occurred any time on or after the first in -clinic application of study drug  
through the last application of study medication.  Medical history noted prior to the first study drug 
administra tion that worsen after Baseline will also be reported as AEs and included in the 
summaries.  
Treatment -emergent AEs will be summarized by treatment group, the number of subjects reporting 
a TEAE, System Organ Class (SOC ), preferred term, severity, relationship to study drug 
(causality), and seriousness.  When summarizing AEs by severity and relationship, each subject 
will be counted only once within a system organ class or a preferred term by using the event with 
the highest severity and greatest re lationship within each classification.  
Serious AEs will be summarized by treatment group, severity, and relationship to study drug, and 
individual SAEs will be listed by subject. In addition, a list of subjects who prematurely 
discontinue from the study du e to an AE will be provided.  
12.1.3.2  Physical Examination  
Changes in physical examination from baseline to end of treatment will be summarized.  Any 
clinically significant changes from Baseline will be documented as an AE.  
12.1.3.3  Urine Pregnancy Tests  
Urine pregnancy tests results for females 9 years of age and older  will be presented in data listings 
by subject.   
13 ETHICS AND RESPONSIB ILITIES  
13.1 Good Clinical Practice  
This study must be conducted in compliance with the protocol, the ICH Guidance for Indust ry E6 
Good Clinical Practice: Consolidated Guidance and the applicable regulatory requirements.  The 
investigator  must submit all essential regulatory documentation, as required by local and national 
regulations (including approval of the protocol and info rmed consent/assent form by an IRB) to 
the CRO before investigational product will be shipped to the study site.  The investigator  will 
review the final study results to confirm that to the best of his knowledge, it accurately describes 
the con duct and res ults of the study.

SB206/Berdazimer Sodium Gel  Page 62 of 69 
 
 
    
    
     13.2 Data Safety Monitoring Board  (DSMB)  
When approximately 200 subjects (cumulative across studies MC301 and MC302 ) have completed 
4 weeks of treatment, a Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will review all available unblinded 
safety data (i ncluding patch testing).  All responsibilities of the DSMB and details of data to be 
reviewed will be detailed in the DSMB charter . 
13.3 Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics Committee  
The protocol, informed consent / assent  form(s), recruitment materials, and all participant materials 
will be submitted to the Institutional Review Board (IRB) for review and approval. Approval of 
both the protocol and the consent /assent  form must be obtained before any subject  is screened . 
Any amendment to the protocol will require review and approval by the IRB before the changes 
are implemented to the study.  In addition, all changes to the consent /assent  form will be IRB -
approved; a determination will be made regarding whether a new consent needs to be obtained 
from subjects  who provided consent, using a previously appr oved consent form.  
13.4 Informed Consent  
Informed consent is a process that is initiated prior to the subject  agreeing to participate in the 
study and continues throughout the subje ct’s study participation. Consent /assent  forms will be IRB  
-approved and the subject  will be asked to read and review the document. The investigator  will 
explain the research study to the subject  and answer any questions that may arise. A verbal 
explanatio n will be provided in terms suited to the subject ’s comprehension of the purposes, 
procedures, and potential risks of the study and of their rights as research subjects . Subject s will 
have the opportunity to carefully review the written consent /assent  form  and ask questions prior 
to signing. The subjects  should have the opportunity to discuss the study with their family or 
surrogates or think about it prior to agreeing to participate. The informed consent /assent  document  
should be signed  prior to any proced ures being done specifically for the study. Subjects  must be 
informed that participation is voluntary and that they may withdraw from the study at any time, 
without prejudice. A copy of the informed consent /assent  document will be given to the subjec ts 
for their records. The informed consent process will be conducted and documented in the source 
document (including the date), and the form signed, before the subject  undergoes any study -
specific procedures. The rights and welfare of the subject s will be prote cted by emphasizing to 
them that the quality of their medical care will not be adversely affected if they declin e to 
participate in this study.

     13.5 Records Management  
It is the responsibility of the investigator  to ensure that the study center file is maintain ed in 
accordance with Section 8 – Essential Documents for the Conduct of a Clinical Trial of the ICH 
Guidance for Industry E6 Good Clinical Practice: Consolidated Guidance and 21 CFR Part 312.  
13.6 Source Documentation  
Data collection is the responsibility of t he clinical trial staff at the site under the supervision of the 
site investigator . The investigator  is responsible for ensuring the accuracy, completeness, 
legibility, and timeliness of the data reported.  
All source documents should be completed in a neat, legible manner to ensure accurate 
interpretation of data. Data recorded on the eCRF derived from s ource documents should be 
consistent with the data re corded on the source documents.  
Clinical data  will be entered into a 21 CFR Part 11 -compliant data capture system provided by the  
CRO . The data system includes password protection and internal quality ch ecks, such as automatic 
range checks, to identify data that appear inconsistent, incomplete, or inaccurate. Clinical data will 
be entered directly from the source documents.  
13.7 Study Files and Record Retention  
It is a Novan requirement that all investigator s participating in clinical studies maintain detailed 
clinical data for one of the following periods, whichever is longest:  
• Country -specific requirements; or  
• A period of at least two years following the last a pproval of a marketing application 
approved by a Regulatory Authority in an ICH region or until there are no pending or 
contemplated marketing applications in an ICH region; or,  
• A period of two years after Novan notifies the investigator  that the data will  not be 
submitted for review by any Regulatory Authority.  
The investigator  must not dispose of any records or essential documents relevant to this study 
without either (1) written permission from Novan, or (2) providing an opportunity for Novan to 
collect such records. The investigator  shall take responsibility for maintaining adequate and 
accurate electronic or hard copy source documents of all observations and data generated during 
this study. Such documentation is subject to inspection by Novan and relev ant regulatory agencies. 
If the investigator  withdraws from the study (e.g., relocation, retirement), all study -related records 
should be transferred to a mutually agreed -upon designee. Notice of such transfer will be provided 
to Novan in writing .

     14 AUDITING  AND MONITORING  
14.1 Auditing  
In addition to the routine monitoring procedures, audits of clinical research activities in accordance 
with standard operating procedures ( SOPs ) may be performed to evaluate compliance with the 
principles of GCP. A regulatory autho rity may also wish to conduct an inspection (during the study 
or even after its completion). If a regulatory authority requests an inspection, the investigator  must 
inform the CRO  immediately that this request has been made.  
Study conduct may be assessed d uring the course of the study by a Quality Assurance 
representative(s) to ensure that the study is conducted in compliance with the protocol and GCP.  
He/she will be permitted to inspect the study documents (study protocol, study records, 
investigational p roduct, original, study -relevant medical records). All subject data will be treated 
confidentially.  
14.2 Monitoring  
All aspects of the study will be monitored by the CRO or Novan according to  GCP and Standard 
Operating Procedures (SOPs) for compliance with appl icable government regulations, (i.e., 
informed consent regulations, (21 C.F.R. § 50.20, 1999), and Institutional Review Board 
regulations, (21 C.F.R. § 56.103, 1981)). Access to all records, both during the trial and after trial 
completion, should be made available to the CRO  and Novan at any time for review and audit to 
ensure the integrity of the data. The investigator  must notify the CRO  immediately if the 
responsible IRB has been disqualified or if proceedings leading t o disqualification have begun.  
The investigator  must conduct the protocol in accordance with applicable GCP regulations and 
guidelines, applicable informed consent regulations (21 C.F.R. § 50.20, 1999), and in compliance 
with the principles in the Declaration of Helsinki. Every attempt must be made to follow the 
protocol and to obtain and record all data requested for each subject at the specified times. If data 
is not recorded per protocol, the reason(s) must be clearly documented on the study records.  
Before study initiation, at a site initiation visi t or at a meeting with the investigator (s), a CRO  or 
Novan representative will review the protocol and study records with the investigator (s) and their 
staff. During the study, the study monitor will visit the site regularly to check the completeness of 
subject records, the accuracy of entries into the study database, the adherence to the protocol and 
to GCP, the progress of enrollment, to ensure that consent is being sought and obtained in 
compliance with applicable regulations, and that the investigationa l product is being stored, 
dispensed and accounted for according to specifications. The investigator  and key trial personnel 
must be available to assist the monitor during these visits.

     The investigator  must give the monitor access to relevant hospital or clinical records to confirm 
their consistency with the study database entries. No information in these records about the identity 
of the subjects will leave the study center. Monitoring standards require full verification for the 
presence of informed conse nt, adherence to the inclusion/exclusion criteria, documentation of 
AEs/ SAEs and the recording of primary efficacy and safety variables. Additional checks of the 
consistency of the study records with the study database will be performed according to the st udy-
specific monitoring plan.  
The investigator  or designee must promptly enter the data into the study database after the subject’s 
visit. The monitor is responsible for reviewing them and clarifying and resolving any data queries.  
A copy of the study rec ords will be retained by the investigator  who must ensure that it is stored 
in a secure place with other study documents, such as the protocol, the Investigator ’s Brochure and 
any protocol amendments.  
The investigator  must provide the CRO and the responsib le IRB with a study summary shortly 
after study completion.  
15 AMENDMENTS  
Protocol modifications, except those intended to reduce immediate risk to study subjects, may be 
made only by Novan . A protocol change intended to eliminate an apparent immediate hazard  to 
subjects may be implemented immediately, provided the IRB/IEC is notified within 5 days.  
Any permanent change to the protocol must be handled as a protocol amendment. The written 
amendment must be submitted to the IRB/IEC and the investigator  must await approval before 
implementing the changes. Novan  will submit protocol amendments to the appr opriate regulatory 
authorities for approval.  
If in the judgment of the IRB/IEC, the investigator , and/or Novan , the amendment to the protocol 
substantially changes the study design and/or increases the potential risk to the subject and/or has 
an impact on the subject's involvement as a study participant, the currently approved written 
informed consent form will require similar modification. In such cases, informed consent will be 
renewed for subjects enrolled in the study before continued participation.  
16 STUDY REPORT AND PUBLIC ATIONS  
Novan  is responsible for preparing and providing the appropriate regulatory authorities with 
clinical study reports according to the applicable regulatory requirements.  
The publication policy of Novan  is discussed in the investig ator's Clinical Research Agreement.

     17 STUDY DISCONTINUATIO N  
Both Novan  and the principal investigator  reserve the right to terminate the study at the 
investigator ’s site at any time. Should this be necessary, Novan  or a specified designee will inform 
the ap propriate regulatory authorities of the termination of the study and the reasons for its 
termination, and the principal investigator  will inform the IRB/IEC of the same. In terminating the 
study, Novan  and the principal investigator  will assure that adequate consideration is given to the 
protection of the subjects’ interests.  
18 CONFIDENTIALITY  
All information generated in this study is considered highly confidential and must not be disclosed 
to any person or entity not directly involve d with the study unless prior written consent is gained 
from Novan . However, authorized regulatory officials, IRB/IEC personnel, Novan  and its 
authorized representatives are allowed full access to the records.  
Subject’s will only be identified at a minimum  by unique subject numbers in the study database . 
If required, the subject's full name may be made known to an authorized regulatory agency or other 
authorized official.

     20.2 APPENDIX II  Procedure for Suspected Sensitization  
In the event that a subject has a local skin reaction (L SR) severe enough that is felt to be 
suggestive of allergic contact dermatitis, patch testing may be initiated for confirm ation after 
consultation with the CRO Med ical Monitor and with the consent of the subject/caregiver . Once 
the LSR has been completely resolved for a period of 2 weeks and up to 2 months, patch testing 
may commence. Novan will provide more detailed patch testing instruction s once requested from 
the CRO Medical Monitor.  The site will use a study drug kit already assigned to the subject in 
order to complete the testing.  
 
For patch testing:  
• Discontinue study treatment (see Section 7.2.4  regarding LSRs ) 
• Document the event as an AE and consult with the CRO Medical Monitor. Detailed 
instructions for the patch testing will be provided after discussion with the Medical 
Monitor.  
• Whe n applicable, challenge patch testing should be performed after all signs and 
symptoms of the LSR have been resolved for approximately 2 weeks to 2 months.  
• The randomized study treatment will be applied to a naïve area on the participant’s back 
or arm. Use  the subject’s most recently assigned study drug kit to obtain material for 
testing.  
• The participant will return to the site approximately 48 hours after the application of the 
patches. Approximately 30 minutes, 24 hours and 48 hours after patch removal, t he patch 
site(s) will be evaluated using the scale below  (Table 2). If the 48 -hour reading is 
equivocal, it is recommended to evaluate the site at 72 to 96 hours after rem oval. Take 
photographs if the reaction interpretation is positive or equivocal and transmit them to the 
Medical Monitor. Further instructions will be given after review of the photos.  
• At the last reading, the investigator will make the final interpretation  of any challenge 
reactions. See Table 3 below.

1. INTRODUCTION 
This document outlines the statistical methods to  be implemented during the analyses of data 
collected within the scope of Novan, Inc. protocol version 1.0 [A Phase 3 Multi-Center, 
Randomized, Double-Blind, Vehicle-Controlled, Para llel Group Study Comparing the Efficacy 
and Safety of SB206 and Vehicle Gel Once Daily in the Treatment of Molluscum Contagiosum]. The purpose of this plan is to provide specific guidelines from which the st atistical analyses will 
proceed. Any deviations from this plan will be documented in the clinical study report. 
2. STUDY DOCUMENTS 
The following study documents are used for the preparation of the statistical analysis plan (SAP): 
x Protocol version 1.0, 26Mar2019 
x Annotated electronic case report form (eCRF) version 3.0, 14Aug2019 
x Data management plan version 1.0, 12Apr2019 
3. STUDY OBJECTIVES 
The objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of SB206 12% once daily (QD) for the treatment of molluscum contagiosum (MC). 
4. STUDY DESIGN AND PLAN 
This is a Phase 3 multi-center, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled, parallel group study 
to be conducted in approximately 340 subjects ≥6 months of age with MC. After obtaining 
informed consent/assent, subjects who satisfy entry criteria will be randomized to a 2:1 (active:vehicle) scheme. Subjects receiving curren t treatment for MC at the time of the Screening 
Visit will enter a washout period of up to 14 days prior to randomization. In the event no washout period is required, Screening and Baseline visit activities may be combined into a single 
visit. At randomization, subjects will be stratified into 4 strata corresponding to the cross-classification of household number of randomly assigned subjects (1 subject per household vs 2 subjects per household) and investigator type (der matologist vs other). Households randomizing 
2 subjects will receive the same treatment assign ment for both subjects. Up to 2 subjects from 
the same household may be randomly assigned on the same day, if both individually meet all 
inclusion and exclusion criteria. For subjects in the same household, Screening can occur on different days; however, the baseline visit must occur on the same day. 
Subjects or their caregivers will apply SB206 12% or Vehicle Gel QD for a minimum of 4 weeks 
and up to 12 weeks to all lesions identified at Ba seline and new treatable lesions that arise during 
the course of the study. Subjects or their caregivers will continue to treat the area until the next 
scheduled visit even if the lesion(s) clear. If the investigator determines all lesions are cleared at 
a clinic visit, the treatment may stop. At Weeks 2, 4, 8 and 12, the investigator will count and record the number of active (raised, treatable) molluscum lesions per body area. At Weeks 2, 4,

and 8, the investigator will determi ne if new lesions have occurred  since the last visit, and the 
subject or caregiver will be instructed by the investigator to re-initiate treatment. If treatment is 
stopped due to clearance, subjects will continue regularly scheduled visits through Week 24. 
Subjects will visit the clinic at Screening/Baseline, Week 2, Week 4, Week 8, Week 12, and 
Week 24. Subjects will be contacted via phone on Day 2 to collect subject information on early 
dose reactions. At Weeks 16 and 20, subjects will be contacted via phone to capture information 
regarding MC recurrence and adverse events (AEs);  at Week 24, the subject will be seen at the 
site for a final study visit to assess scarri ng, keloid, and MC recurrence. Subjects who 
discontinue the study prior to the Week 12 visit due to AEs or other reasons will be asked to 
complete the Week 12 visit assessments: this will be recorded as an Early Termination (ET1) 
visit. No study drug treatment will be provided after the Week 12 visit. Subjects who discontinue 
from the study after Week 12 but prior to Week 24 will be asked to come to the site to complete Week 24 assessments; this will be recorded as an ET2 visit. 
Safety assessments include local skin reactions (LSRs), AE collection, including scarring/keloid, 
and urine pregnancy tests. Safety  assessments will be completed at specified site visits through 
Week 12. After Week 12, safety information for ongoing AEs and new AEs will be collected, 
along with information regarding household MC occurrence. 
Inflammatory reactions around the MC has been associated with imminent resolution of MC 
(sometimes referred to as “beginning -of-the- end” [“BOTE”] sign). The investigator (or 
designated evaluator) will assess the presence and overall degree of inflammatory reactions at 
MC lesions at Baseline (before dosing) and Week s 2 through 12. In most cases, clinical features 
can differentiate between BOTE and LSR. BOTE may be associated with itch, but not pain. BOTE is usually asymptomatic, self-limited, and localized to individual MC lesions and does not 
require discontinuation of study treatment or additi onal treatment. LSR is generally more diffuse, 
associated with significant itch or tenderness, may necessitate discontinuation of study treatment, 
and may need treatment for symptomatic relief (e.g., a topical corticosteroid or topical anesthetic). For very severe LSR, systemic cortic osteroids may be considered. Investigators will 
assess the treatment area at each scheduled visit and use their medical judgement to differentiate 
between BOTE and LSRs. BOTE Inflammation Score  and LSR score will be recorded at each 
visit. BOTE should not be considered an AE . When LSRs are clinically significant at the 
application site, the investigator shoul d report the condition as an AE(s). 
At Baseline (at least 30 minutes after dosing) an d Weeks 2 through 12, the investigators will rate 
LSRs on individual features including erythema, flaking/scaling, crusting, swelling, vesiculation/pustulation, and erosion/ulceration. At Baseline (pre-dose) and Weeks 2 through 12, 
the investigators will rate BOTE signs using the BOTE Inflammation Score.  
The following tables describe the scoring parameters for the BOTE Inflammation Score and LSR 
score.

Clinically significant LSRs that are reported as AEs and/or subject-reported intolerability (i.e., 
itching, pain) may result in an investigator-dir ected temporary treatment hold (drug holiday), and 
topical corticosteroids may be used to treat LSRs for up to 2 weeks. The subject may re-initiate study drug treatment prior to the next scheduled vi sit. Upon re-initiation of study drug treatment, 
if a subject develops worsening LSRs, allergic contact dermatitis may be suspected. The investigator may take photographs of the suspected allergic contact dermatitis and discuss possible confirmation of allergic contact dermatitis with the contract research organization ’s

(CRO) medical monitor. The investigator should also discuss the necessity of patch testing with 
the subject/caregiver. The investigator will then discontinue the subject from study drug treatment and treat the area(s) with corticosteroids for up to 2 weeks. If the subject provides consent/assent, the investigator will consult with the CRO ’s medical monitor to implement the 
process for patch testing.  
Adverse events will be assessed and collected af ter the initiation of study drug treatment through 
the end of the subject’s last visit. Treatment-related AEs will be  followed up until resolution or 
up to 1 year after last treatment, whichever is sooner.  Scar formation will be assessed starting at the Week 4 visit through Week 12 and again at 
Week 24. The investigator will map locations of the molluscum lesions at Baseline. Additional lesions identified through Week 12 will be added to the map. Using the map as a guidance, the investigator will assess the treated areas for scar/keloid formation. The investigator will count and record the number of active (raised, treatable) molluscum lesions per body area. If a new scar is noted after the subject treated with study drug, this will be considered an AE for the purposes of this study. In addition, keloid/hypertr ophic scars will also be recorded as AEs.  
If a subject’s treatment is discontinued by the investigator or the subject because of an AE, that 
AE should be indicated as the reason for trea tment discontinuation. All subjects will be 
encouraged to remain in the study throughout the 24-week study duration. 
When approximately 200 subjects (cumulat ive across studies MC301 and MC302) have 
completed 4 weeks of treatment, a data safety  monitoring board (DSMB) will review all 
available unblinded safety data (including patch testing).  5. DETERMINATION OF SAMPLE SIZE 
Approximately 340 subjects, 6 months of age and older, with a minimum of 3 and a maximum of 
70 MC lesions at Baseline will be randomized in a 2:1 (active:vehicle) scheme. The sample size 
assumptions for this study were informed by the completed Phase 2 study NI-MC201 of subjects 2 years of age and older with between 3 and 70 MC lesions at Baseline. In the Intent-to-Treat 
(ITT) Population of the Phase 2 study, the observed rates of complete clearance at Week 12 were 18% (12/66) for vehicle and 38% (18/48) for SB 206 12% QD and the covariate-adjusted 
treatment difference was 18%.  
A sample size of 340 subjects (227 subjects in the SB206 12% QD group and 113 subjects in the 
vehicle group) will provide 94% power for a 2-side d alpha test of size 0.05 to detect an absolute 
difference of 18% when the vehicle response ra te is 18%. This same sample size provides 93% 
power to detect a treatment difference of 18% when the vehicle response rate is 20% and 83% 
power when the treatment difference is 15% and the vehicle response rate is 20%.  
Since the intra-cluster correlation is estimated to be small (<10%) and the average size of 
households is expected to be capped at roughly 1.3, the sample size is still sufficient when 
considering the fact that the subjects within the household may not be independent.

6. GENERAL ANALYSIS CONSIDERATIONS 
The statistical analyses will be reported using summary tables, listings, and figures (TLFs). The 
International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) numb ering convention will be used for all TLFs. 
Unless otherwise noted, all statistical testing will  be 2-sided and will be performed at the 0.05 
significance level. Tests will be declared st atistically significant if the calculated P-value is 
≤0.05 .  
Continuous variable summaries will include the nu mber of subjects (n) with non-missing values, 
mean, standard deviation (SD), median, minimum, and maximum. Other statistics such as quartiles, confidence intervals (CIs), and number of missing values may be added as appropriate.  
Categorical variable summaries will include the fr equency and percentage of subjects who are in 
the category or each possible value. In general, the denominator for the percentage calculation will be based upon the total number of subjects in the study population within each treatment group, unless otherwise specified. The denominator for by-visit displays will be the number of subjects in the relevant study population with non-missing data at each visit.  
All summary tables will be presented by treatment group. Baseline summaries will also include 
an overall summary column.  
Individual subject data obtained from the eCRF s and any derived data will generally be 
presented by subject in data listings.
 
The analyses described in this plan are considered a priori, in that they have been defined prior to 
breaking the blind.  Any analyses performed subsequent to breaking the blind will be considered post hoc and 
exploratory. Post hoc analyses will be labeled as  such on the output and identified in the clinical 
study report.  
All analyses and tabulations will be performed using SAS
£ software Version 9.4 or higher. 
Tables, listings, and figures will be presented in RTF format.  
The process for SAS program validation and quality control (QC) for programs and outputs is documented in the Synteract working instruction “SAS programming quality control. ” 
Study-specific QC requirements can be found in Appendix C: SAS Programming QC 
Requirements. 
7. NOTATION OF TREATMENT GROUPS AND VISITS 
Analysis visits 
 Baseline is defined as the last nonmissing value recorded prior to the first application of study 
drug. If time is not recorded and the assessment was on the same day as the first application of 
Page 11/117

Novan NI-MC301 SAP Version 1.0  
study drug, then it will be assumed the assessmen t occurred prior to the application of study drug. 
The baseline record will have an analysis visit of “Baseline”.  
 
For all evaluations of all parameters, assessments will  be analyzed according to the visit at which 
they occurred (i.e., per the eCRF visit label). In order to account for the fact that the Week 12 and 
Early Termination visits are collected on the same eCRF in the database, a check against the Study 
Exit form will be made to determine if the visit is a Week 12 or an Early Termination Visit. If the 
visit is an Early Termination visi t, then the visit will be mapped according to the table below. If 
there is no corresponding Study Exit form on the sa me date, then it will be considered a Week 12 
visit. However, if there is no assessment in a give n visit, then the following visit windows will be 
applied to determine if an unscheduled visit may be used: 
 
Visit  Analysis Visit Target Study Day Study Day Analysis Window 
    
Week 2 (±3 days) Week 2 15 Day 12 to 22 
Week 4 (±5 days) Week 4 29 Day 23 to 43 
Week 8 (±5 days) Week 8 57 Day 44 to 71 
Week 12 (±5 days) Week 12 85 Day 72 to 98 
 
Days are measured from the date of randomization. Study days corresponding to measurements 
are calculated as: 
x Assessment date – date of randomization + 1, if assessment date is on or after the date of 
randomization. 
x Assessment date – date of randomization, if measurement date is before the date of 
randomization. 
In the event of multiple unscheduled records fall ing in the same analysis window, the assessment 
which is closest to the target study day will be chosen for analysis.  
8. ANALYSIS POPULATIONS 
The following subject population will be used for disposition analyses:  
x The Enrolled Population will consist of all subjects who sign informed consent. If a 
subject is randomly assigned to a treatment, then treatment assignment will be based on 
randomized treatment; otherwise, they will be deemed a screen failure and will only 
appear in the overall summary columns of output. 
Page 12/117

CONFIDENTIAL 
Novan NI-MC301 SAP Version 1.0  
The following subject population will be used for safety analyses:  
x The Safety Population will consist of all subjects who receive at least 1 application of 
study medication. Treatment assignment will be  based on the treatment actually received. 
If a subject receives any amount of SB206, then they will be summarized in the SB206 12% QD arm.  
The following subject populations will be used for efficacy analyses:  
x The ITT Population will consist of all subjects who are randomized. Treatment assignment will be based on the randomized treatment.  
x The Per-Protocol (PP) Population will consist of all subjects in the ITT Population who had no significant protocol deviations that impacted the analyses of efficacy endpoints. Final determination of subject inclusion in  the PP Population will be made prior to 
unblinding. Treatment assignment will be  based on the randomized treatment. 
9. STUDY POPULATION 
9.1 Subject Disposition 
Subject disposition information will be summarized for all subjects by treatment group. Summaries will include: the number of subject s screened, the number of subjects in each 
analysis population, the number of subjects wher e study treatment stopped, primary reason for 
study treatment stopped, the number of subjects co mpleting 12 weeks of the study (defined as 
having an end of treatment reas on of “Completed Treatment Per Protocol” or a reason of 
“Complete Clearance Prior to Week 12” and does not have a Study  Exit date prior to the 
subject’s), the number of subjects completed the study, and the primary reason for discontinuation.  
A summary of the number of subjects in each center and each population will be presented.  
9.2 Eligibility 
A listing of subjects not fulfilling any el igibility criteria will be created. 
9.3 Demographic and Baseline Characteristics 
Demographic variables include age, sex, age, ethnicity, and race. Age will be calculated in years 
relative to the informed consent date.  
Other baseline characteristics include lesion counts at  baseline, site type (d ermatologist vs other), 
number of sites and a breakdown of site type, number of randomly assigned subjects in 
household (1 subject vs 2 subjects), number of households and breakdown of household size, age 
at diagnosis of the current molluscum episode and time since diagnosis. Descriptive statistics 
will be presented for ages and other continuous variables. Frequency counts and percentages will

Novan NI-MC301 SAP Version 1.0  
be presented for sex, ethnicity, race and other categorical variables. Demographic and baseline 
characteristics will be summarized for the Safety, ITT, and PP Populations.  
9.4 Extent of Exposure 
Study drug exposure will be summarized for each treatment using the total number of 
applications, the duration of treatment, and th e number of subjects requiring a treatment 
interruption and modification. Duration of treatment is defined as the last application date minus 
the first application date plus 1. 
Study drug compliance will be su mmarized and calculated as follows: 
Compliance [%] = (Actual applications applied)/(Planned applications) ×100, where 
x Actual applications applied = Planned applications – the number of applications missed 
x Planned applications = Number of applications (days) planned up to the point of 
treatment discontinuation.  
This implies that if a subject treatment discont inues treatment prior to Week 12 due to complete 
clearance, then the number of applications takes this information into account and the subject is not penalized for having complete clearance.  
Compliance will be further summarized into 2 groups:  
1. Subjects who did not have any interruptions or modifications using the same formula as 
above, and 
2. Subjects with modifications or interruptions. F or these subjects, an adjusted compliance 
will be calculated in the following manner: the actual applications applied will be the 
same as above but the planned applications will exclude the time where the subject has 
dosing interrupted.  
9.5 Protocol Deviations 
Significant protocol deviations that could potentially affect the efficacy or safety conclusions of the study will be identified prior to database lock and unblinding  of individual subject treatment 
information. Significant protocol deviations may include, but are not limited to: 
x Randomly assigned subjects who did not satisf y selected inclusion and exclusion criteria 
x Randomly assigned subjects who developed w ithdrawal criteria during the study but were 
not withdrawn 
x Subjects who were randomized incorrectly including subjects of the same household who are randomized to different treatments  
x Subjects who received the wrong treatment 
x Subjects where the subject/site staff were unproperly unblinded

Novan NI-MC301 SAP Version 1.0  
x Week 12 Lesion Count not performed 
x Subjects who received an excluded concomitant treatment. 
The decision whether a subject is excluded from the PP Population will be made during the data 
review meeting prior to unblinding and database lock. Reasons for exclusion of a subject from 
the analysis and protocol deviations will be listed. 
A listing of all protocol deviations including the deviation designation (major or minor and 
significant or not), category, and indication of wh ether the deviation led to an exclusion of a 
subject from the PP Population will be presented in a data listing.   
Major and significant protocol deviations will  be summarized by deviation category and 
treatment group.  9.6 Medical History 
Medical history verbatim terms in the eCRFs will be mapped to system organ classes and 
preferred terms using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) Version 22.0. 
Subject incidence of unique medical history terms  by MedDRA system organ class and preferred 
term will be presented. The summary will be ordered by descending order of incidence of system 
organ class and preferred term within each system organ class. 
9.7 Prior and Concomitant Medications 
Prior and concomitant medication verbatim terms in the eCRFs will be mapped to 
anatomical/therapeutic/chemical (ATC) class and preferred names using the WHODrug Global 
B3 (version March 2019). Prior medications are those medications started prior to the first 
application of study drug. Concomitant medications  are those medications started on or after the 
date of first application of study drug or medications started prior to initial application of study 
drug and continued during the study. A medica tion can be classified as both prior and 
concomitant. If it cannot be de termined whether the medication was a prior (or concomitant) 
medication due to a partial start or stop date , then it will be counted as both prior and 
concomitant; see Appendix B for the im putation of missing dates algorithm. 
Prior and concomitant medications will be summarized for each treatment by WHODrug Global 
ATC class Level 3 and preferred name. These summ aries will present the number and percentage 
of subjects using each medication. Subjects may ha ve more than 1 medication per ATC class and 
preferred name. At each level of subject summar ization, a subject is c ounted once if he/she 
reported 1 or more medications at that level. Each  summary will be ordered by descending order 
of incidence of ATC class and preferred name within each ATC class.

10. EFFICACY ANALYSES 
The primary efficacy analysis will be based on the ITT Population. Additional supportive 
efficacy analyses will be performed using the PP Population. 
10.1 Efficacy Endpoints 
The primary efficacy endpoint is the proportion of subjects with complete clearance of all 
treatable MC at Week 12.  
The secondary efficacy endpoint is the proportion of subjects with complete clearance of all 
treatable MC at Week 8.  
Complete clearance is defined as having  a total number of lesions count of 0.  
The exploratory endpoints are the following: 
x Proportion of subjects with complete clearance of all treatable MC at Week 2 and Week 4 
visits 
x Proportion of subjects achieving at least a 75%  reduction from Baseline in the number of 
all treatable MC at each visit (Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12) 
x Percent change from Baseline in number of treatable MC at each visit (Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12) 
x Change from Baseline in number of treatab le MC at each visit (Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12) 
x Proportion of subjects who have a recurrence of MC after the first visit at which complete 
clearance was observed, defined as the total lesion count being greater than 0 at any point 
after achieving a count of 0 
x Time to complete clearance of all treatable MC, defined as the days between the date of 
first dose and the first date of clearance. Subjects who do not achieve complete clearance 
will be censored at the date of the last lesion count assessment.  
x Proportion of subjects with scarring, defined as an answer of Yes to either question on the 
Scarring/Keloid Assessment eCRF page: “Was the presence of a scar  > 1 mm deep and/or 
5 mm wide noted?”  or “Was the presence of a scar noted?” , after clearance of lesion(s) at 
each visit (Weeks 4, 8, 12, 24) 
x Proportion of subjects with keloid or hypertroph ic scar, defined as an answer of Yes to 
the Scarring/Keloid Assessment eCRF page question “Was the pres ence of a keloid or 
hypertrophic scar noted?”, after clearance of lesion (s) at each visit (Weeks 4, 8, 12, 24) 
x Change from Baseline of the composite score from age-matched (at Baseline) Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) or Children’s Dermatology Life Quality Index 
(CLDQI) assessment at Week 12

x Subject-reported spread to household members as measured by any new occurrence of 
MC in household members of subjects at each visit (Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24) 
10.2 Baseline Values 
Unless otherwise noted, baseline is defined as the last nonmissing value recorded prior to the 
first application of study drug. If time is not reco rded and the assessment was on the same day as 
the first application of study drug, then it will be assumed the assessment occurred prior to the 
application of study drug.  
10.3 Adjustments for Covariates 
The model for the primary efficacy will include adjustments for the following covariates: investigator type (dermatologist vs other), household number of randomized subjects (1 subject per household vs 2 subjects per house hold), age, and baseline lesion count. 
10.4 Handling of Dropouts or Missing Data 
In analyses based on response, a missing response will be considered a nonresponder.  
For a sensitivity analysis, subjects with missing  lesion count at Week 12 but who demonstrated 
complete clearance at the last collected lesion assessment will be counted as responders.  
10.5 Interim Analysis and Data Monitoring 
When approximately 200 subjects (cumulative across studies NI-MC301 and NI-MC302) have 
completed 4 weeks of treatment, a DSMB will  review all available unblinded safety data 
(including patch testing). All responsibilities of the DSMB and details of the analysis and data to 
be reviewed is detailed in the DSMB charter.  
10.6 Examination of Subgroups 
Subgroup analyses of complete clearance at Week 12 for investigator type (dermatologist vs other) and household number of randomized subject s (1 subject per household vs 2 subjects per 
household), and will be presented in a forest plot for the ITT Population. An additional subgroup analysis of complete clearance at Week 12 for age (≤1 year old, >1 to ≤2 years old, >2 to ≤6 
years old, >6 to ≤12 years old, >12 to ≤18 years old, >18 years old) and MC disease duration prior to baseline (≤6 months v s >6 months) will be summarized descriptively for the ITT 
Population. 
10.7 Multiple Comparison/Multiplicity 
The familywise error rate with respect to the primary endpoint and sec ondary endpoint will be 
strongly controlled at the alpha=0.05 level using a fixed-sequence method testing strategy. If the
primary endpoint is not statistically significan t at the alpha=0.05 level, the secondary efficacy

endpoint will be considered not significant. If the primary endpoint is statistically significant at 
the alpha=0.05 level, then the secondary efficacy  endpoint will be analyzed. If the secondary 
efficacy endpoint fails to reach statistical significance at the alpha=0.05 level, it will be 
considered not statistically significant.  
10.8 Multicenter Studies 
This is a multicenter study, having approximately 35 centers participating in the study. The center effects will be investigated in the primary statistical analysis model . 
11. METHODS OF EFFICACY ANALYSIS 
11.1 Primary Efficacy Analysis 
The primary efficacy comparison will test the following hypotheses: 
H
0: The proportion of subjects with complete cl earance is equal between SB206 12% QD and 
Vehicle; 
H1: The proportion of subjects with complete clearance is different between SB206 12% QD 
and Vehicle.  
 
The primary efficacy model will be the following for ߨு೔ as the probability of complete 
clearance for the ith subject in household H:

be included in the class statement with PARAM=REF and REF=Vehicle. The working 
correlation will have an exchangeable structure. The model will include a repeated statement for 
subject household with household ID in the cla ss statement. Also, the data structure will be 
ordered according to household ID and subject ID in household.

Novan NI-MC301 SAP Version 1.0  
Treatment groups will be compared using a generalized estimating equation for logistic 
regression with an exchangeable working corr elation structure. The model will include 
treatment, investigator type (dermatologist vs  other), household number of randomly assigned 
subjects (1 subject per household vs 2 subjects per household), age, and baseline lesion count as 
factors. The odds ratio between SB206 12% and vehicle gel, 95% confidence intervals for the 
odds ratio, and P-value for the covariate-adjusted trea tment comparison will be presented; 
together with predicted proportions along w ith their associated 95% confidence interval. 
As a sensitivity analysis, the above primary analysis model will be applied to the PP Population. An additional sensitivity analysis counting subjects who discontinued prior to Week 12 or have a missing lesion count assessment but who demonstr ated complete clearance at the last collected 
lesion assessment as responders will be presented. The impact of mis-stratifications may be explored via a sensitivity analysis.   
An analysis where the complete clearance response probability for any dropouts prior to Week 
12 will be varied across the following scenarios (Vehicle response probability, SB206 response probability): 
(0.1, 0.1) (0.1, 0.0)    
(0.2, 0.2) (0.2, 0.1) (0.2, 0.0)   
(0.3, 0.3) (0.3, 0.2) (0.3, 0.1) (0.3, 0.0)  
(0.4, 0.4) (0.4, 0.3) (0.4, 0.2) (0.4, 0.1) (0.4, 0.0) 
An additional sensitivity analysis will be performed in a subset of the ITT population where only 1 subject from each household is chosen base d on the subject with the highest number of 
baseline treatable MC and the oldest to break ties, if needed, to contribute to the model. A 
logistic regression model including treatment, investigator type, age, and baseline lesion counts will be utilized. 
11.2 Secondary Efficacy Analyses 
The secondary endpoint of the proportion of subjects with complete clearance of all treatable MC 
at Week 8 will be analyzed in the same manner as the primary endpoint. A sensitivity analysis 
using the PP Population will be provided.  
11.3 Exploratory Analyses 
The exploratory endpoints based on the proportio n of subjects achieving complete clearance or 
75% reduction will be analyzed in the same manner as the primary endpoint.  
Since the within-household correlation is expected to be small and the change and percent 
change from Baseline in the number of treatable MC are exploratory, they will be analyzed using a repeated measures mixed model for the respective visits with the same covariates as the primary model together with visits and treatment by visit; an unstructured covariance matrix will 
be utilized. If the calculation of the percent change  from baseline is infl uenced by outliers with 
Page 19/117

Novan NI-MC301 SAP Version 1.0  
calculated values >100%, then the influence of outliers will be avoided for analysis by censoring 
them so that all values were in the range of -100% to 100%. 
Since the within-household correlation is expec ted to be small and time to first complete 
clearance of all MC is exploratory, it will be  analyzed using Kaplan-Meier methods. The number 
and percentage of subjects achieving complete clearance, number and percentage of censored 
subjects, and Kaplan-Meier estimates of first quartile, median, and third quartile will be 
summarized by treatment group. Differences in Kaplan-Meier curves between the treatments will 
be tested for significance using a stratified log-rank test. 
The proportion of subjects with scarring and the proportion of subjects with keloid or 
hypertrophic scarring will be summarized descriptively at each visit. 
The change from Baseline of the composite scor e from age-matched (at Baseline) DLQI/CDLQI 
will be summarized descriptively and separately for each questionnaire. The scoring algorithms 
are detailed in Appendix A. Additionally, the changes from Baseline in the following subscales: 
Symptoms and Feelings, Daily Activities, Leisure, Work and School, Personal Relationships, and Treatment, for DLQI, and Symptoms and Feelings, Leisure, School or Holidays, Personal 
Relationships, Sleep, and Treatment, for CDLQI,  and each question will be summarized 
descriptively. 
The subject-reported spread of MC to household me mbers not in the study will be summarized 
descriptively including a breakdown of whether or not there was any spread and then a 
breakdown of the amount of spread within the household at each visit at the household level.  
12. OTHER ANALYSES 
The following analyses of BOTE vs lesion count/complete clearance will be presented: 
x Percent change from Baseline at Week 12 in relation to the highest BOTE score during 
treatment. 
x Complete clearance at Week 12 in relation to the highest BOTE score during treatment. 
x Percent change from Baseline at each visit in relation to BOTE score at Week 2. 
x Complete clearance at each visit in relation to BOTE score at Week 2. 
In these analyses, the BOTE scores will be analyzed in the ITT Population as follows: 
1. Dichotomized: 
a. Score of 0 or 1: No to Mild 
b. Score of 2, 3, or 4: Moderate to Very Severe 
A shift table comparing the baseline BOTE score to each scheduled postbaseline assessment will be presented for the Safety Population.

13. SAFETY ANALYSES 
All safety analyses will be based on the Safety Population. 
 A listing of all deaths will be presented. 
13.1 Adverse Events 
All AE summaries will be restricted to treatme nt-emergent AEs (TEAEs), which are defined as 
those AEs that occurred any time on or after the first in-clinical application of study drug through 
the last application of study medication and t hose existing AEs that worsened during this same 
period. If it cannot be determined whether the AE  is treatment emergent due to a partial onset 
date, then it will be counted as such; see Appendix B for the imputation of missing dates algorithm.  Verbatim terms in the eCRFs will be mappe d to preferred terms and system organ 
classes using the MedDRA Version 22.0.  
Each AE summary will be displayed by treatment group. Summaries that are displayed by 
system organ classes and preferred terms will be  ordered by descending order of incidence of 
system organ class and preferred term within  each system organ class. Summaries of the 
following types will be presented: 
x Overall summary of TEAEs that contain an overview of each item below. 
x Subject incidence of TEAEs and total number of unique TEAEs by MedDRA system 
organ class and preferred term.  
x Subject incidence of TEAEs by MedDRA system organ class, preferred term, and 
maximum severity. At each level of subjec t summarization, a subject is classified 
according to the maximum severity if the subject reported 1 or more events. Adverse 
events with missing severity will be considered severe for this summary. 
x Subject incidence of TEAEs by MedDRA system organ class, preferred term, and closest relationship to study drug (Related/Not Re lated). Related AEs are those reported as 
“Definite ,” “Probable ,” or “Possib le,” and unrelated AEs are those reported as “Unlikely” 
or “Unrelated. ” At each level of subject summarizatio n, a subject is classified according 
to the closest relationship if the subject report ed 1 or more events. Adverse events with a 
missing relationship will be considered related for this summary. 
x Subject incidence of serious TEAEs and total number of unique serious TEAEs by MedDRA system organ class and preferred term.  
x Subject incidence of TEAEs leading to study drug discontinuation by MedDRA system 
organ class and preferred term. 
x Subject incidence of TEAEs leading to death as an outcome by MedDRA system organ 
class and preferred term.

Separate listings of all AEs, all SAEs and all AE s leading to study drug discontinuation will be 
provided.  
13.2 Local Skin Reaction 
The LSR composite score will be calculated by summing up all the numerical responses (0-4) to 
each individual parameter for a composite score th at ranges between 0 and 24. The change from 
Baseline of the LSR composite score will be summarized descriptively. A table summarizing each LSR parameter (erythema, flaking/scaling, cr usting, swelling, vesiculation/pustulation, and 
erosion/ulceration) score at each scheduled postbaseline assessment will be presented. 
Additionally, a shift table comparing the baseline score for each LSR parameter to each scheduled postbaseline assessment will be presented for the Safety Population. 
13.3 Events of Special Interest 
Events of Special Interest will include subjects with any TEAE where the preferred term contains 
“application site”, subjects with at least 1 post-ba seline occurrence of moderate BOTE 
inflammation score, or subjects wi th at least 1 post-baseline LSR component score ≥ 1. A 
summary including the number and percentage of subjects with at least 1 event of special interest, AEs of interest by MedDRA system organ class and preferred term, at least 1 moderate BOTE inflammation score, and any LSR component score ≥ 1  will be provided for the Safety 
Population. The analysis will also be repeated with the LSR criteria revised to include any post-
baseline LSR component (excluding erythema) score ≥ 1. 
13.4 Urine Pregnancy Test 
Urine pregnancy test results will be included in a data listing only.  
13.5 Physical Examination 
A shift table summarizing the shift from Baseli ne to end of treatment in normal/abnormal will be 
presented.  13.6 Patch Testing 
A table summarizing any patch testing resu lts by time point will be presented.

Appendix B: Presentation of Data  and Programming Specifications  
General  
x Specialized text styles, such as bold, italics, borders, and shading will not be used in 
tables, figures, and data listings unless they add significant value to the table, figure, or 
data listing. 
x Only standard keyboard characters are to be used in tables and data listings. 
x Special characters, such as nonprintable control characters, printer-specific, or font-specific characters, will not be used  on a table, figure, or data listing. 
x Hexadecimal character representations are allowed (e.g., μ, D, ß). 
x All footnotes will be left justified and at the bottom of a page. Footnotes must be used 
sparingly and must add value to the table, figure, or data listing. 
 
Tables 
x Formal organization of tabulations may be changed during programming, if appropriate, 
e.g., tables for the different variables may be combined into a single table, or tables with more than 1 variable may be split into several tables. 
x Means and medians will be presented to 1 more decimal place than the raw data. 
Standard deviations will be presented to 2 more decimal places than the raw data. 
Minimums and maximums will be reported with the same number of decimal places as the raw data.  
x Percentages will be presented to the tenths place. 
x For frequency counts of categorical variables, categories whose counts are zero will be 
displayed for the sake of completeness. For example, if none of the subjects discontinue due to “lost to follow- up,” this reason will be included in the table with a count of 0. 
Categories with zero counts will not have zero percentages displayed. 
x Lower and upper confidence interval values must be presented to 1 decimal place more 
than the raw/derived data (i.e., to the same number of decimal places as the mean). 
x Percentiles (e.g., 25%, 75%) must be pre sented to 1 decimal place more than the 
raw/derived data. 
x For all inferential analyses, P values will be rounded to 4 decimal places (or at the 
highest level of precision) with a leading zero (0.0001). P values less than 0.0001 will be 
presented as “<0.0001 .” 
x The last footnotes will be 
- “Source: xxx ”, where xxx indicates the source table number (s) if applicable (in case aggregated 
results like mean or median are plotted) or the so urce listing(s) (in case individual responses are 
plotted) and/or source dataset(s) (e.g., AdaM).  
- “PROGRAM SOURCE: … \\xx.sas, DATA CUT OFF DATE: DDMMMYYYY, RUN DATE: 
DDMMY Y hh:mm”.  
where extract date (e.g., data cut off, database lock) is the date stamp of the data snapshot 
used.

Figures 
x Legends will be used for all figures with more than 1 variable or item displayed. 
Treatment group sizes (n=xx) will  be included, as appropriate. 
x Figures will be in black and white but can be  in color to add value to the clarity and 
readability of a figure. Lines must be wide enough to see the line after being copied. 
x For box plots, the horizontal line will represent the median, + represents the group mean, the length of the box represents the interquartile range (25
th-75th percentiles), and the 
whiskers will represent the minimum and maximum. 
x The last footnotes will be 
- “Source: xxx”, where xxx indicates the source listing number(s) and/or source  dataset(s) (e.g., AdaM).  
- “PROGRAM SOURCE: … \\xx.sas, DATA CUT OFF DATE: DDMMMYYYY, RUN DATE: 
DDMMYY hh:mm”.  
where extract date (e.g., data cut off, database lock) is the date stamp of the data snapshot used. 
 Listings 
x Formal organization of the listing may be changed during programming, if appropriate, 
e.g., additional variables may be included, change in the column order, or the listing may 
be split into multiple parts due to space constraints. 
x If not otherwise specified, all data listings w ill be sorted by sequence/treatment, center, 
subject number, visit, and date/time, as appropriate.  
x All date values will be presented in a SAS date (e.g., 29AUG2001) format.  
x All observed time values will be prese nted using a 24-hour clock HH:MM:SS format 
(e.g., 01:35:45 or 11:26). Seconds will only be reported if they were measured as part of 
the study. 
x The last footnote will be 
- “PROGRAM SOURCE: … \\xx.sas, DATA CUT OFF DATE: DDMMMYYYY, RUN DATE: 
DDMMYY hh:mm”.  
where extract date (e.g., data cut off, database lock) is the date stamp of the data snapshot used.

Missing or incomplete dates (i.e., AEs and concomitant medications) 
The most conservative approach will be systema tically considered. If the AE onset date is 
missing/incomplete, it is assumed to have occ urred during the study treatment phase (i.e., 
considered a TEAE) except if the partial onset date  or other data, such as the stop date, indicates 
differently. Similarly, a medication with partial start and stop dates could be considered as both a 
prior and concomitant treatment.  
The following algorithms will be applied to missing and incomplete start and stop dates: 
 Start Dates 
x If the day portion of the start date is missing, then the start date will be estimated to be 
equal to the date of first application of study drug, provided the start month and year are 
the same as the first application of study drug  and the stop date is either after the first 
application of study drug or completely missing . Otherwise, the missing day portion will 
be estimated as “01.” 
x If both the day and month portions of the start date are missing, then the start date will be estimated to be equal to the date of first appl ication of study drug, provided the start year 
is the same as the first application of study dru g and the stop date is either after the first 
application of study drug or completely missing. Otherwise, the event will be assumed to start on the first day of the given year (e.g., ??-???-2013 is estimated as 01-JAN-2013) or the subject’s date of birth, whichever is latest . 
x If the start date is completely missing and th e stop date is either after the application of 
study drug or completely missing, the start date will be estimated to be the first day of study drug application. Otherwise, the start date will be estimated to be the first day of the same year as the stop date or the subject’s date of birth, whichever is latest . All other 
non-AE and non-concomitant medication day calculations where only partial dates are 
available will be handled as follows: the first day of the month will be used in the calculations if the day part of a start date is  missing while January 1 will be employed if 
both the month and day parts of a start date are missing.  
Stop Dates 
x If only the day of resolution is unknown, the day will be assumed to be the last day of the month (e.g., ??-JAN-2013 will be treated as 31-JAN-2013).  
x If both the day and month of resolution are unknown, the event will be assumed to have ceased on the last day of the year (e.g., ??-???-2013 will be treated as 31-DEC-2013).  
x If the stop date is completely missing and the event is not continuing, the event will be assumed to be after first application of stud y drug and will be imputed using the last 
known date on the study.

If the start date of current molluscum episode is partial, then the following imputation will be 
made: 
x If only the day is unknown, the day will be assumed to be the first day of the month or the date of birth, whichever is later. 
x If the day and month are missing, then the start date will be estimated to be June 1
st or the 
date of birth, whichever is later. 
 
Standard Calculations 
Variables requiring calculation will be derived using the following formulas: 
x Days  – A duration expressed in days between 1 date (date1) and another later date (date2) is 
calculated using the formulas noted below: 
Duration in days = date2 – date1 + 1. 
x Months – A duration expressed in months will be calculated as (later date – earlier date + 
1)/(30.4167). 
x Years – A duration expressed in years will  be calculated as (later date – earlier date + 
1)/(365).  
x Change from Baseline – Change from Baseline will be calculated as follows: 
Change from Baseline = postbaseline value – baseline value. 
x Percent change from Baseline – Change from Baseline will be calculated as follows: 
Percent change from Baseline = (postbaseline value – baseline value)/baseline value  
× 100.

Appendix C: SAS Program ming QC Requirements  
Derived datasets are independently programmed by two programmers. The separate datasets 
produced by the 2 programmers must match 100% . Detailed specifications for the derived 
datasets are documented in the study analysis dataset specifications provided to the client at 
study conclusion.  
Tables are independently reprogrammed by a second programmer for numeric results.  
Listings are checked for consistency against corr esponding tables, figures, and derived datasets. 
Figures are checked for consistency against corresponding tables and listings, or independently 
reprogrammed if there are no corresponding tables or listings. 
The entire set of TLFs is checked for completenes s and consistency prior to its delivery to the 
client by the lead biostatistician and a senior level, or above, reviewer.

1. INTRODUCTION 
This document outlines the statistical methods to  be implemented during the analyses of data 
collected within the scope of Novan, Inc. prot ocol version 1.0 [A Phase 3 Multi-Center, 
Randomized, Double-Blind, Vehicle-Controlled, Parallel Group Study Comparing the Efficacy 
and Safety of SB206 and Vehicle Gel Once Daily in the Treatment of Molluscum Contagiosum]. 
The purpose of this plan is to provide specific guidelines from which the st atistical analyses will 
proceed. Any deviations from this plan will be documented in the clinical study report. 
2. STUDY DOCUMENTS 
The following study documents are used for the prepar ation of the statistical analysis plan (SAP): 
x Protocol version 1.0, 26Mar2019 
x Annotated electronic case report form (eCRF) version 3.0, 14Aug2019 
x Data management plan version 1.0, 12Apr2019 
3. STUDY OBJECTIVES 
The objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of SB206 12% once daily (QD) for the treatment of molluscum contagiosum (MC). 
4. STUDY DESIGN AND PLAN 
This is a Phase 3 multi-center, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled, parallel group study 
to be conducted in approximately 340 subjects ≥6 months of age  with MC. After obtaining 
informed consent/assent, subjects who satisfy en try criteria will be randomized to a 2:1 
(active:vehicle) scheme. Subjects receiving curren t treatment for MC at the time of the Screening 
Visit will enter a washout period of up to 14 days prior to randomization. In the event no washout period is required, Screening and Baseline visit activities may be combined into a single 
visit. At randomization, subjects will be stra tified into 4 strata corresponding to the cross-
classification of household number of randomly assigned subjects (1 subject per household vs 2 subjects per household) and investigator type (der matologist vs other). Households randomizing 
2 subjects will receive the same treatment assign ment for both subjects. Up to 2 subjects from 
the same household may be randomly assigned on the same day, if both individually meet all 
inclusion and exclusion criteria. For subjects in the same household, Screening can occur on different days; however, the baseline visit must occur on the same day. 
Subjects or their caregivers will apply SB206 12% or Vehicle Gel QD for a minimum of 4 weeks 
and up to 12 weeks to all lesions identified at Baseline and new treatable  lesions that arise during 
the course of the study. Subjects or their caregivers will continue to treat the area until the next 
scheduled visit even if the lesion(s) clear. If the investigator determines all lesions are cleared at 
a clinic visit, the treatment may stop. At Weeks 2, 4, 8 and 12, the investigator will count and 
record the number of active (raised, treatable) molluscum lesions per body area. At Weeks 2, 4,

and 8, the investigator will determi ne if new lesions have occurred  since the last visit, and the 
subject or caregiver will be instructed by the investigator to re-initiate treatment. If treatment is 
stopped due to clearance, subjects will continue regularly scheduled visits through Week 24. 
Subjects will visit the clinic at Screening/Baseline, Week 2, Week 4, Week 8, Week 12, and 
Week 24. Subjects will be contacted via phone  on Day 2 to collect s ubject information on early 
dose reactions. At Weeks 16 and 20, subjects will be contacted via phone to capture information 
regarding MC recurrence and adverse events (AEs); at Week 24, the subject will be seen at the 
site for a final study visit to assess scarri ng, keloid, and MC recurrence. Subjects who 
discontinue the study prior to the Week 12 visit du e to AEs or other reasons will be asked to 
complete the Week 12 visit assessments: this will be recorded as an Early Termination (ET1) visit. No study drug treatment will be provided after the Week 12 visit. Subjects who discontinue from the study after Week 12 but prior to Week 24 will be asked to come to the site to complete 
Week 24 assessments; this will be  recorded as an ET2 visit. 
Safety assessments include local skin reactions (LSRs), AE collection, including scarring/keloid, 
and urine pregnancy tests.  Safety assessments will be comple ted at specified site visits through 
Week 12. After Week 12, safety information for o ngoing AEs and new AEs will be collected, 
along with information regarding household MC occurrence. 
Inflammatory reactions around the MC has been associated with imminent resolution of MC 
(sometimes referred to as “beginning -of-the- end” [“BOTE”] sign). The investigator (or 
designated evaluator) will assess the presence a nd overall degree of inflammatory reactions at 
MC lesions at Baseline (before dosing) and Week s 2 through 12. In most cases, clinical features 
can differentiate between BOTE and LSR. BOTE  may be associated with itch, but not pain. 
BOTE is usually asymptomatic, self-limited, and localized to individual MC lesions and does not 
require discontinuation of study treatment or addition al treatment. LSR is generally more diffuse, 
associated with significant itch or tenderness, may necessitate disconti nuation of study treatment, 
and may need treatment for symptomatic relief  (e.g., a topical corticosteroid or topical 
anesthetic). For very severe LSR, systemic corticos teroids may be considered. Investigators will 
assess the treatment area at each scheduled visit and use their medical judgement to differentiate 
between BOTE and LSRs. BOTE Inflammation Score and LSR score will be recorded at each visit. BOTE should not be considered an AE. When LSRs are clinically significant at the application site, the investigator should report the condition as an AE(s). 
At Baseline (at least 30 minutes after dosing) and Weeks 2 through 12, the investigators will rate 
LSRs on individual features including eryt hema, flaking/scaling, crusting, swelling, 
vesiculation/pustulation, and erosion/ulceration.  At Baseline (pre-dose) and Weeks 2 through 12, 
the investigators will rate BOTE signs using the BOTE Inflammation Score.  
The following tables describe the scoring para meters for the BOTE Inflammation Score and LSR 
score.

Clinically significant LSRs that are reported as AEs and/or subject-reported intolerability (i.e., 
itching, pain) may result in an investigator-directed temporary treatment hold (drug holiday), and 
topical corticosteroids may be used to treat LSRs  for up to 2 weeks. The subject may re-initiate 
study drug treatment prior to the next scheduled vi sit. Upon re-initiation of study drug treatment, 
if a subject develops worsening LSRs, alle rgic contact dermatitis may be suspected. The 
investigator may take photographs of the suspected allergic contact dermatitis and discuss 
possible confirmation of allergic contact dermatitis with the contract research organization ’s

(CRO) medical monitor. The investigator should also discuss the necessity of patch testing with 
the subject/caregiver. The investigator will then discontinue the subject from study drug treatment and treat the area(s) with corticosteroids for up to 2 weeks. If the subject provides consent/assent, the investigator will consult with the CRO ’s medical monitor to implement the 
process for patch testing.  
Adverse events will be assessed and collected  after the initiation of study drug treatment through 
the end of the subject’s last visit. Treatment-related AEs will be  followed up until resolution or 
up to 1 year after last treatment, whichever is sooner.  Scar formation will be assessed starting at the Week 4 visit through Week 12 and again at 
Week 24. The investigator will map locations of the molluscum lesions at Baseline. Additional lesions identified through Week 12 will be added to the map. Using the map as a guidance, the investigator will assess the treated areas for scar/keloid formation. The investigator will count 
and record the number of active (raised, treatable) molluscum lesions per body area. If a new scar is noted after the subject treated with study drug, this will be considered an AE for the purposes of this study. In addition, keloid/hypertr ophic scars will also be recorded as AEs.  
If a subject’s treatment is discontinued by the investigator or the subject because of an AE, that 
AE should be indicated as the reason for trea tment discontinuation. All subjects will be 
encouraged to remain in the study throughout the 24-week study duration. 
When approximately 200 subjects (cumulative across studies MC301 and MC302) have 
completed 4 weeks of treatment, a data safety  monitoring board (DSMB) will review all 
available unblinded safety data (including patch testing).  
5. DETERMINATION OF SAMPLE SIZE 
Approximately 340 subjects, 6 months of age and older, with a minimum of 3 and a maximum of 
70 MC lesions at Baseline will be randomized in a 2:1 (active:vehicle) scheme. The sample size 
assumptions for this study were informed by the completed Phase 2 study NI-MC201 of subjects 
2 years of age and older with between 3 and 70 MC lesions at Baseline. In the Intent-to-Treat 
(ITT) Population of the Phase 2 study, the observed ra tes of complete clearance at Week 12 were 
18% (12/66) for vehicle and 38% (18/48) for SB206 12% QD and the covariate-adjusted treatment difference was 18%.  
A sample size of 340 subjects (227 subjects in the SB206 12% QD group and 113 subjects in the 
vehicle group) will provide 94% power for a 2-side d alpha test of size 0.05 to detect an absolute 
difference of 18% when the vehicle response rate is 18%. This same sample size provides 93% 
power to detect a treatment difference of 18% when the vehicle response rate is 20% and 83% 
power when the treatment difference is 15% and the vehicle response rate is 20%.  
Since the intra-cluster correlation is estimated to be small (<10%) and the average size of 
households is expected to be capped at roughly 1. 3, the sample size is still sufficient when 
considering the fact that the subjects within the household may not be independent.

6. GENERAL ANALYSIS CONSIDERATIONS 
The statistical analyses will be reported using summary tables, listings, and figures (TLFs). The 
International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) numb ering convention will be used for all TLFs. 
Unless otherwise noted, all statistical testing will  be 2-sided and will be performed at the 0.05 
significance level. Tests will be declared statistically significant if the calculated P-value is 
≤0.05 .  
Continuous variable summaries will include the number of subjects (n) with non-missing values, 
mean, standard deviation (SD), median, minimum, and maximum. Other statistics such as quartiles, confidence intervals (CIs), and number of missing values may be added as appropriate.  
Categorical variable summaries will include the frequency and percentage of subjects who are in 
the category or each possible value. In genera l, the denominator for the percentage calculation 
will be based upon the total number of subjects in the study population within each treatment group, unless otherwise specified. The denominator for by-visit displays will be the number of 
subjects in the relevant study population with non-missing data at each visit.  
All summary tables will be presented by treatm ent group. Baseline summaries will also include 
an overall summary column.  
Individual subject data obtained from the eCRF s and any derived data will generally be 
presented by subject in data listings.
 
The analyses described in this plan are considered a priori, in that they have been defined prior to 
breaking the blind.  
Any analyses performed subsequent to breaking the blind will be considered post hoc and 
exploratory. Post hoc analyses will be labeled as such on the output and identified in the clinical 
study report.  
All analyses and tabulations will be performed using SAS£ software Version 9.4 or higher. 
Tables, listings, and figures will be presented in RTF format.  
The process for SAS program validation and quality control (QC) for programs and outputs is 
documented in the Synteract working instruction “SAS programming quality control.”  
Study-specific QC requirements can be found in Appendix C: SAS Programming QC 
Requirements.  
The study treatment period is defined from randomization through completion of Week 12/ET1 
visit and the safety follow-up period is from the completion of Week 12 through the completion 
of Week 24/ET2 visit.  After all subjects have completed their Week 12/ET1  visit, thus completing the Treatment Period 
of the study, the database through Week 12/ET1 will be frozen and unblinded for purposes of the

primary analysis of efficacy and safety.  While this analysis is being prepared, the subjects will 
continue through Week 24/ET2. After all subjects have completed their Week 24/ET2 visit, the database will be locked and the follow-up data will be analyzed. 
7. NOTATION OF TREATMENT GROUPS AND VISITS 
Analysis visits 
 Baseline is defined as the last nonmissing value recorded prior to the first application of study 
drug. If time is not recorded and the assessment was on the same day as the first application of 
study drug, then it will be assumed the assessmen t occurred prior to the application of study drug. 
The baseline record will have a n analysis visit of “Baseline”.  
 For all evaluations of all parameters, assessments w ill be analyzed according to the visit at which 
they occurred (i.e., per the eCRF  visit label). In order to account  for the fact that the Week 12 and 
Early Termination visits are collected on the same eCRF in the database, a check against the Study 
Exit form will be made to determine if the visit is a Week 12 or an Early Termination Visit. If the visit is an Early Termination visi t, then the visit will be mapped according to the table below. If 
there is no corresponding Study Exit form on the same date, then it will be considered a Week 12 
visit. If there is no assessment in a given visit, then the following visit windows will be applied to 
determine if an unscheduled visit may be used:  
Visit  Analysis Visit Target Study Day Study Day Analysis Window 
    
Week 2 (±3 days) Week 2 15 Day 12 to 22 
Week 4 (±5 days) Week 4 29 Day 23 to 43 
Week 8 (±5 days) Week 8 57 Day 44 to 71 
Week 12 (±5 days) Week 12 85 Day 72 to 98 
 
Days are measured from the date of randomization. Study days corresponding to measurements 
are calculated as: 
x Assessment date – date of randomization + 1, if assess ment date is on or after the date of 
randomization. 
x Assessment date – date of randomization, if measurement date is before the date of 
randomization. 
In the event of multiple unscheduled records fa lling in the same analysis window, the assessment 
which is closest to the target study day will be chosen for analysis.  
8. ANALYSIS POPULATIONS 
The following subject population will be used for disposition analyses:  
Page 50/117

CONFIDENTIAL 
Novan NI-MC301 SAP Version 2.0  
x The Enrolled Population will consist of all subjects who sign informed consent. If a 
subject is randomly assigned to a treatment, then treatment assignment will be based on 
randomized treatment; otherwise, they will be deemed a screen failure and will only 
appear in the overall summary columns of output. 
The following subject population will be used for safety analyses:  
x The Safety Population will consist of all subj ects who receive at least 1 application of 
study medication. Treatment assignment will be  based on the treatmen t actually received. 
If a subject receives any amount of SB206, th en they will be summarized in the SB206 
12% QD arm.  
The following subject populations will be used for efficacy analyses:  
x The ITT Population will consist of all s ubjects who are randomized. Treatment 
assignment will be based on the randomized treatment.  
x The Per-Protocol (PP) Population will cons ist of all subjects in the ITT Population who 
had no significant protocol deviations that im pacted the analyses of efficacy endpoints. 
Final determination of subject inclusion in  the PP Population will be made prior to 
unblinding. Treatment assignment will be based on the randomized treatment. 
9. STUDY POPULATION 
9.1 Subject Disposition 
Subject disposition information will be summarized for all subjects by treatment group. Summaries will include: the number of subject s screened, the number of subjects in each 
analysis population, the number of subjects where study treatment stopped, primary reason for study treatment stopped, the numbe r of subjects completing 12 weeks of the study (defined as 
having an end of treatment reason of “Completed Treatment Per P rotocol” or a reason of 
“Complete Clearance Prior to W eek 12” and does not have a Study  Exit date prior to the 
subject’s ), the number of subjects completed the study, and the primary reason for 
discontinuation.  A summary of the number of subjects in each center and each population will be presented.  
9.2 Eligibility 
A listing of subjects not fulfilling any eligibility criteria will be created. 
9.3 Demographic and Baseline Characteristics 
Demographic variables include age, sex, ethnicity, and race. Age will be calculated in years 
relative to the informed consent date.  
Page 51/117
 
 
Novan, Inc.   Statistical Analysis Plan NI-MC301  11Sep2019  
 
TMP-SOP-0202-001-03_SAP Template  Page 13/38 
CONFIDENTIAL 
Novan NI-MC301 SAP Version 2.0  
Other baseline characteristics include lesion counts at  baseline, site type (d ermatologist vs other), 
number of sites and a breakdown of site type, number of randomly assigned subjects in 
household (1 subject vs 2 subjects), number of households and breakdown of household size, age at diagnosis of the current molluscum episode and time since diagnosis. Descriptive statistics 
will be presented for ages and other continuous variables. Frequency counts and percentages will 
be presented for sex, ethnicity, race and other categorical variables. Demographic and baseline 
characteristics will be summarized for the Safety, ITT, and PP Populations.  
9.4 Extent of Exposure 
Study drug exposure will be summarized for e ach treatment using the total number of 
applications, the duration of treatment, and the number of subjects requiring a treatment 
interruption and modification. Duration of treatment is defined as the last application date minus the first application date plus 1. 
Study drug compliance will be summar ized and calculated as follows: 
Compliance [%] = (Actual applications applied)/(Planned applications) ×100, where 
x Actual applications applied = Planned applications – the number of applications missed 
x Planned applications = Number of applications (days) planned up to the point of 
treatment discontinuation.  
This implies that if a subject treatment discont inues treatment prior to Week 12 due to complete 
clearance, then the number of applications takes this information into account and the subject is 
not penalized for having complete clearance.  
Compliance will be further summarized into 2 groups:  
1. Subjects who did not have any interruptions or modifications using the same formula as 
above, and 
2. Subjects with modifications or interruptions. F or these subjects, an adjusted compliance 
will be calculated in the following manner: the actual applications applied will be the 
same as above but the planned applications will exclude the time where the subject has 
dosing interrupted.  
9.5 Protocol Deviations 
Significant protocol deviations that could potentially  affect the efficacy or safety conclusions of 
the study will be identified prior to database lock and unblinding  of individual subject treatment 
information. Significant protocol deviations  may include, but are not limited to: 
x Randomly assigned subjects who did not satis fy selected inclusion and exclusion criteria 
x Randomly assigned subjects who developed withdrawal criteria during the study but were not withdrawn

x Subjects who were randomized incorrectly including subjects of the same household who 
are randomized to different treatments  
x Subjects who received the wrong treatment 
x Subjects where the subject/site staff were unproperly unblinded 
x Week 12 Lesion Count not performed 
x Subjects who received an excluded concomitant treatment. 
The decision whether a subject is excluded from the PP Population will be made during the data review meeting prior to unblinding and database lo ck. Reasons for exclusion of a subject from 
the analysis and protocol deviations will be listed. 
A listing of all protocol deviations including the deviation designation (major or minor and 
significant or not), category, and indication of whether the deviation led to an exclusion of a subject from the PP Population will be presented in a data listing.   
Major and significant protocol deviations wi ll be summarized by deviation category and 
treatment group.  9.6 Medical History 
Medical history verbatim terms in the eCRFs w ill be mapped to system organ classes and 
preferred terms using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) Version 22.0. 
Subject incidence of unique medical history terms by MedDRA system organ class and preferred term will be presented. The summary will be ordered by descending order of incidence of system organ class and preferred term within each system organ class. 
9.7 Prior and Concomitant Medications 
Prior and concomitant medication verbatim terms in the eCRFs will be mapped to 
anatomical/therapeutic/chemical (ATC) class and preferred names using the WHODrug Global 
B3 (version March 2019). Prior medications are those medications started prior to the first 
application of study drug. Concomitant medications are those medications started on or after the 
date of first application of study drug or medicati ons started prior to initial application of study 
drug and continued during the st udy. A medication can be classified as both prior and 
concomitant. If it cannot be de termined whether the medication was a prior (or concomitant) 
medication due to a partial start or stop date , then it will be counted as both prior and 
concomitant; see Appendix B for the imputation of missing dates algorithm. 
Prior and concomitant medications will be summarized for each treatment by WHODrug Global 
ATC class Level 3 and preferred name. These summ aries will present the number and percentage 
of subjects using each medication. Subjects may ha ve more than 1 medication per ATC class and 
preferred name. At each level of subject summar ization, a subject is counted once if he/she

reported 1 or more medications at that level. Ea ch summary will be ordered by descending order 
of incidence of ATC class and preferr ed name within each ATC class. 
10. EFFICACY ANALYSES 
The primary efficacy analysis will be based on the ITT Population. Additional supportive 
efficacy analyses will be performed using the PP Population. 
10.1 Efficacy Endpoints 
The primary efficacy endpoint is the proportion of subjects with complete clearance of all 
treatable MC at Week 12.  
The secondary efficacy endpoint is the proportion of subjects with complete clearance of all 
treatable MC at Week 8.  
Complete clearance is defined as having a total number of lesions count of 0.  
The exploratory endpoints are the following: 
x Proportion of subjects with complete clearance of all treatable MC at Week 2 and Week 4 
visits 
x Proportion of subjects achieving at least a 75%  reduction from Baseline in the number of 
all treatable MC at each visit (Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12) 
x Percent change from Baseline  in number of treatable MC at each visit (Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12) 
x Change from Baseline in number of treatab le MC at each visit (Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12) 
x Proportion of subjects who have a recurrence of MC after the first visit at which complete 
clearance was observed, defined as the total lesion count being greater than 0 at any point 
after achieving a count of 0 
x Time to complete clearance of all treatable MC, defined as the days between the date of first dose and the first date of clearance. Subjects who do not achieve complete clearance 
will be censored at the date of th e last lesion count assessment.  
x Proportion of subjects with scarring, defined as an answer of Yes to either question on the Scarring/Keloid Assessment eCRF page: “Was the presence of a scar  > 1 mm deep and/or 
5 mm wide noted?”  or “Was the presence of a scar noted?” , after clearance of lesion(s) at 
each visit (Weeks 4, 8, 12, 24) 
x Proportion of subjects with keloid or hypertroph ic scar, defined as an answer of Yes to 
the Scarring/Keloid Assessment eCRF page question “Was the pres ence of a keloid or 
hypertrophic scar noted?”, after clearance of lesion(s) at each visit (Weeks 4, 8 , 12, 24)

x Change from Baseline of the composit e score from age-matched (at Baseline) 
Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) or Children’s Dermatology Life Quality Index 
(CLDQI) assessment at Week 12 
x Subject-reported spread to household memb ers as measured by any new occurrence of 
MC in household members of subjects at each visit (Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24) 
10.2 Baseline Values 
Unless otherwise noted, baseline is defined as the last nonmissing value recorded prior to the 
first application of study drug. If time is not reco rded and the assessment was on the same day as 
the first application of study drug, then it will be  assumed the assessment occurred prior to the 
application of study drug. If a subject was randomized but not treated, then baseline is defined as 
the last nonmissing value on or before the date of randomization.  
10.3 Adjustments for Covariates 
The model for the primary efficacy will incl ude adjustments for the following covariates: 
investigator type (dermatologist vs other), household number of randomized subjects (1 subject per household vs 2 subjects per household), age, and baseline lesion count. 
10.4 Handling of Dropouts or Missing Data 
In analyses based on response, a missing re sponse will be considered a nonresponder.  
For a sensitivity analysis, subjects with missing lesion count at Week 12 but who demonstrated 
complete clearance at the last collected lesion assessment will be counted as responders.  
10.5 Interim Analysis and Data Monitoring 
When approximately 200 subjects (cumulative across studies NI-MC301 and NI-MC302) have 
completed 4 weeks of treatment, a DSMB will  review all available unblinded safety data 
(including patch testing). All res ponsibilities of the DSMB and details of the analysis and data to 
be reviewed is detailed in the DSMB charter.  
10.6 Examination of Subgroups 
Subgroup analyses of complete clearance at Week  12 for investigator type (dermatologist vs 
other) and household number of randomized subject s (1 subject per household vs 2 subjects per 
household), and will be presented in a forest plot for the ITT Population. An additional subgroup 
analysis of complete clearance at Week 12 for age (≤1 year old, >1 to ≤2 years old, >2 to ≤6 
years old, >6 to ≤12 years old, >12 to ≤18 years  old, >18 years old) and MC disease duration 
prior to baseline (≤6 months vs >6 months)  will be summarized descriptively for the ITT 
Population.

10.7 Multiple Comparison/Multiplicity 
The familywise error rate with respect to the primary endpoint and secondary endpoint will be 
strongly controlled at the alpha=0.05 level using a fixed-sequence method testing strategy. If the 
primary endpoint is not statistically significant  at the alpha=0.05 level, the secondary efficacy 
endpoint will be considered not significant. If the primary endpoint is statistically significant at 
the alpha=0.05 level, then the secondary efficacy endpoint will be analyzed. If the secondary 
efficacy endpoint fails to reach statistical significance at the alpha=0.05 level, it will be considered not statistically significant.  
10.8 Multicenter Studies 
This is a multicenter study, having approxima tely 35 centers participating in the study. The 
center effects will be investigated in the primary statistical analysis model. 
11. METHODS OF EFFICACY ANALYSIS 
11.1 Primary Efficacy Analysis 
The primary efficacy comparison will test the following hypotheses: 
H
0: The proportion of subjects with complete clearance is equal between SB206 12% QD and 
Vehicle; 
H1: The proportion of subjects with complete clearance is different between SB206 12% QD 
and Vehicle.  
 
The primary efficacy model will be the following for ߨு೔ as the probability of complete 
clearance for the ith subject in household H:

correlation will have an exchangeable structure. The model will include a repeated statement for 
subject household with household ID in the cla ss statement. Also, the data structure will be 
ordered according to household ID and subject ID in household. 
 
Treatment groups will be compared using a generalized estimating equation for logistic 
regression with an exchangeable working corre lation structure. The model will include 
treatment, investigator type (dermatologist vs  other), household number of randomly assigned 
subjects (1 subject per household vs 2 subjects pe r household), age, and baseline lesion count as 
factors. The odds ratio between SB206 12% and ve hicle gel, 95% confidence intervals for the 
odds ratio, and P-value for the covariate-adjusted trea tment comparison will be presented; 
together with predicted proportions along with  their associated 95% confidence interval. 
As a sensitivity analysis, the above primary analys is model will be applied to the PP Population. 
An additional sensitivity analysis counting subj ects who discontinued prior to Week 12 or have a 
missing lesion count assessment but who demonstra ted complete clearance at the last collected 
lesion assessment as responders will be presen ted. The impact of mis-stratifications may be 
explored via a sensitivity analysis.   
An analysis where the complete clearance response probability for any dropouts prior to Week 
12 will be varied across the following scenarios (Vehicle response probability, SB206 response probability): 
(0.1, 0.1) (0.1, 0.0)    
(0.2, 0.2) (0.2, 0.1) (0.2, 0.0)   
(0.3, 0.3) (0.3, 0.2) (0.3, 0.1) (0.3, 0.0)  
(0.4, 0.4) (0.4, 0.3) (0.4, 0.2) (0.4, 0.1) (0.4, 0.0) 
An additional sensitivity analysis will be performed in a subset of the ITT population where only 1 subject from each household is chosen base d on the subject with the highest number of 
baseline treatable MC and the oldest to break ties, if needed, to contribute to the model. A 
logistic regression model including treatment, inve stigator type, age, and baseline lesion counts 
will be utilized. 
11.2 Secondary Efficacy Analyses 
The secondary endpoint of the proportion of subjects with complete clearance of all treatable MC 
at Week 8 will be analyzed in the same manner as the primary endpoint. A sensitivity analysis 
using the PP Population will be provided.  
11.3 Exploratory Analyses 
The exploratory endpoints base d on the proportion of subjects achieving complete clearance or 
75% reduction will be analyzed in the same manner as the primary endpoint.

Novan NI-MC301 SAP Version 2.0  
Since the within-household correlation is expec ted to be small and the change and percent 
change from Baseline in the numbe r of treatable MC are exploratory, they will be analyzed using 
a repeated measures mixed model for the respective visits with the same covariates as the 
primary model together with visits and treatment by visit; an unstructured covariance matrix will 
be utilized. If the calculation of the percent change  from baseline is infl uenced by outliers with 
calculated values >100%, then the influence of outliers will be avoided for analysis by censoring 
them so that all values were in the range of -100% to 100%. 
Since the within-household correlation is expected to be small and time to first complete 
clearance of all MC is exploratory, it will be  analyzed using Kaplan-Meier methods. The number 
and percentage of subjects achieving complete clearance, number and percentage of censored 
subjects, and Kaplan-Meier estimates of first quartile, median, and third quartile will be summarized by treatment group. Differences in Kap lan-Meier curves between the treatments will 
be tested for significance using a stratified log-rank test. 
The proportion of subjects with scarring and the proportion of subjects with keloid or hypertrophic scarring will be summarized descriptively at each visit. 
The change from Baseline of the composite scor e from age-matched (at Baseline) DLQI/CDLQI 
will be summarized descriptively and separately  for each questionnaire. The scoring algorithms 
are detailed in Appendix A. Additionally, the chan ges from Baseline in the following subscales: 
Symptoms and Feelings, Daily Activities, Le isure, Work and School, Personal Relationships, 
and Treatment, for DLQI, and Symptoms and Feelings, Leisure, School or Holidays, Personal 
Relationships, Sleep, and Treatment, for CDLQI,  and each question will be summarized 
descriptively. 
The subject-reported spread of MC to household members not in the study will be summarized 
descriptively including a breakdown of whether or not there was any spread and then a 
breakdown of the amount of spread within the household at each visit at the household level.  
12. OTHER ANALYSES 
The following analyses of BOTE vs lesion count/complete clearance will be presented: 
x Percent change from Baseline at Week 12 in relation to the highest BOTE score during 
treatment. 
x Complete clearance at Week 12 in relation to the highest BOTE score during treatment. 
x Percent change from Baseline at each vi sit in relation to BOTE score at Week 2. 
x Complete clearance at each visit in relation to BOTE score at Week 2. 
In these analyses, the BOTE scores will be analyzed in the ITT Population as follows: 
1. Dichotomized: 
a. Score of 0 or 1: No to Mild

b. Score of 2, 3, or 4: Moderate to Very Severe 
A shift table comparing the baseline BOTE score to each scheduled postbaseline assessment will 
be presented for the Safety Population.  
13. SAFETY ANALYSES 
All safety analyses will be based on the Safety Population. 
 A listing of all deaths will be presented. 
13.1 Adverse Events 
All AE summaries will be restricted to treatme nt-emergent AEs (TEAEs), which are defined as 
those AEs that occurred any time on or after the first in-clinical application of study drug through 
the last application of study medication and t hose existing AEs that worsened during this same 
period. If it cannot be determined whether the AE is treatment emergent due to a partial onset 
date, then it will be counted as such; see Appendix B for the imputation of missing dates 
algorithm.  Verbatim terms in the eCRFs will be ma pped to preferred terms and system organ 
classes using the MedDRA Version 22.0.  
Each AE summary will be displayed by treatment group. Summaries that are displayed by 
system organ classes and preferred terms will be ordered by descending order of incidence of system organ class and preferred term within each system organ class. Summaries of the following types will be presented: 
x Overall summary of TEAEs that contain an overview of each item below. 
x Subject incidence of TEAEs and total number of unique TEAEs by MedDRA system 
organ class and preferred term.  
x Subject incidence of TEAEs by MedDRA system organ class, preferred term, and 
maximum severity. At each level of subject summarization, a subject is classified 
according to the maximum severity if the subject reported 1 or more events. Adverse events with missing severity will be considered severe for this summary. 
x Subject incidence of TEAEs by MedDRA system organ class, preferred term, and closest relationship to study drug (Related/Not Relate d). Related AEs are those reported as 
“Definite ,” “Probable ,” or “Possib le,” and unrelated AEs are those reported as “Unlikely” 
or “Unrelated. ” At each level of subject summarizatio n, a subject is classified according 
to the closest relationship if the subject report ed 1 or more events. Adverse events with a 
missing relationship will be considered related for this summary. 
x Subject incidence of serious TEAEs and total number of unique serious TEAEs by MedDRA system organ class and preferred term.

x Subject incidence of TEAEs leading to study drug discontinuation by MedDRA system 
organ class and preferred term. 
x Subject incidence of TEAEs leading to death as an outcome by MedDRA system organ class and preferred term. 
Separate listings of all AEs, all SAEs and all AEs leading to study drug discontinuation will be 
provided.  
13.2 Local Skin Reaction 
The LSR composite score will be calculated by summing up all the numerical responses (0-4) to 
each individual parameter for a composite score th at ranges between 0 and 24. The change from 
Baseline of the LSR composite score will be summarized descriptively. A table summarizing each LSR parameter (erythema, flaking/scali ng, crusting, swelling, vesiculation/pustulation, and 
erosion/ulceration) score at each scheduled postbaseline assessment will be presented. Additionally, a shift table comparing the baseli ne score for each LSR parameter to each 
scheduled postbaseline assessment will be presented for the Safety Population. 
13.3 Events of Special Interest 
Events of Special Interest will include subjects with any TEAE where the preferred term contains 
“application site”, subjects with at least 1 post-ba seline occurrence of moderate BOTE 
inflammation score, or subjects wi th at least 1 post-baseline LSR component score ≥ 1. A 
summary including the number and percentage of subjects with at least 1 event of special interest, AEs of interest by MedDRA system organ class and preferred term, at least 1 moderate 
BOTE inflammation score, and any LSR component score ≥ 1  will be provided for the Safety 
Population. The analysis will also be repeated with the LSR criteria revised to include any post-
baseline LSR component (e xcluding erythema) score ≥ 1 and erythema score ≥ 2 . 
13.4 Urine Pregnancy Test 
Urine pregnancy test results will be included in a data listing only.  
13.5 Physical Examination 
A shift table summarizing the shift from Baseline  to end of treatment in normal/abnormal will be 
presented.  13.6 Patch Testing 
A table summarizing any patch testing re sults by time point will be presented.

Appendix B: Presentation of Data and Programming Specifications  
General  
x Specialized text styles, such as bold, italics, borders, and shading will not be used in 
tables, figures, and data listings unless they add significant value to the table, figure, or 
data listing. 
x Only standard keyboard characters are to be used in tables and data listings. 
x Special characters, such as nonprintable control characters, printer-specific, or font-specific characters, will not be used  on a table, figure, or data listing. 
x Hexadecimal character representations are allowed (e.g., μ, D, ß). 
x All footnotes will be left justified and at the bottom of a page. Footnotes must be used 
sparingly and must add value to the table, figure, or data listing. 
 
Tables 
x Formal organization of tabulations may be changed during programming, if appropriate, 
e.g., tables for the different variables may be combined into a single table, or tables with 
more than 1 variable may be split into several tables. 
x Means and medians will be presented to 1 more decimal place than the raw data. 
Standard deviations will be presented to 2 more decimal places than the raw data. 
Minimums and maximums will be reported with the same number of decimal places as the raw data.  
x Percentages will be presented to the tenths place. 
x For frequency counts of categorical variables,  categories whose counts are zero will be 
displayed for the sake of completeness. For ex ample, if none of the subjects discontinue 
due to “lost to follow- up,” this reason will be included in the table with a co unt of 0. 
Categories with zero counts will not have zero percentages displayed. 
x Lower and upper confidence interval values mu st be presented to 1 decimal place more 
than the raw/derived data (i.e., to the same number of decimal places as the mean). 
x Percentiles (e.g., 25%, 75%) must be presented to 1 decimal place more than the 
raw/derived data. 
x For all inferential analyses, P values will be rounded to 4 decimal places (or at the 
highest level of precision) with a leading zero (0.0001). P values less than 0.0001 will be 
presented as “<0.0001 .” 
x The last footnotes will be 
- “Source: xxx ”, where xxx indicates the source table number (s) if applicable (in case aggregated 
results like mean or median are plotted) or the source listing(s) (in case individual responses are 
plotted) and/or source d ataset(s) (e.g., AdaM).  
- “PROGRAM SOURCE: … \\xx.sas, DATA CUT OFF DATE: DDMMMYYYY, RUN DATE: 
DDMMY Y hh:mm”.  
where extract date (e.g., data cut off, database lock) is the date stamp of the data snapshot used.

Figures 
x Legends will be used for all figures with more than 1 variable or item displayed. 
Treatment group sizes (n=xx) will be included, as appropriate. 
x Figures will be in black and white but can be  in color to add value to the clarity and 
readability of a figure. Lines must be wide enough to see the line after being copied. 
x For box plots, the horizontal line will represent the median, + represents the group mean, the length of the box represents the interquartile range (25
th-75th percentiles), and the 
whiskers will represent the minimum and maximum. 
x The last footnotes will be 
- “Source: xxx”, where xxx indicates the source listing number(s) and/or source  dataset(s) (e.g., AdaM).  
- “PROGRAM SOURCE: … \\xx.sas, DATA CUT OFF DATE: DDMMMYYYY, RUN DATE: 
DDMMYY hh:mm”.  
where extract date (e.g., data cut off, database lock) is the date stamp of the data snapshot used. 
 Listings 
x Formal organization of the listing may be changed during programming, if appropriate, 
e.g., additional variables may be included, change  in the column order, or the listing may 
be split into multiple parts due to space constraints. 
x If not otherwise specified, all data listings will be sorted by sequence/treatment, center, 
subject number, visit, and date/time, as appropriate.  
x All date values will be presented in a SAS date (e.g., 29AUG2001) format.  
x All observed time values will be prese nted using a 24-hour clock HH:MM:SS format 
(e.g., 01:35:45 or 11:26). Seconds will only be rep orted if they were measured as part of 
the study. 
x The last footnote will be 
- “PROGRAM SOURCE: … \\xx.sas, DATA CUT OFF DATE: DDMMMYYYY, RUN DATE: 
DDMMYY hh:mm”.  
where extract date (e.g., data cut off, database lock) is the date stamp of the data snapshot used.

Missing or incomplete dates (i.e., AEs, concom itant medications, and start dates of current 
molluscum episode and initial diagnosis) 
The most conservative approach will be syste matically considered. If the AE onset date is 
missing/incomplete, it is assumed to have occ urred during the study treatment phase (i.e., 
considered a TEAE) except if the partial onset date  or other data, such as the stop date, indicates 
differently. Similarly, a medication with partial st art and stop dates could be considered as both a 
prior and concomitant treatment. 
 
The following algorithms will be applied to missing and incomplete start and stop dates: 
 Start Dates 
x If the day portion of the start date is missing, then the start date will be estimated to be 
equal to the date of first application of st udy drug, provided the start month and year are 
the same as the first application of study drug and the stop date is either after the first 
application of study drug or completely missing. Otherwise, the missing day portion will 
be estimated as “01.” 
x If both the day and month portions of the start date are missing, then the start date will be 
estimated to be equal to the date of first application of study drug, provided the start year 
is the same as the first application of study drug and the stop date is either after the first application of study drug or completely missing. Otherwise, the event will be assumed to start on the first day of the given year (e.g., ??-???-2013 is estimated as 01-JAN-2013) or the subject’s date of birth, whichever is latest . 
x If the start date is completely missing and the stop date is either after the application of 
study drug or completely missing, the start date will be estimated to be the first day of 
study drug application. Otherwise, the start date will be estimated to be the first day of the same year as the stop date or the subject’s date of birth, whichever is latest . All other 
non-AE and non-concomitant me dication day calculations where only partial dates are 
available will be handled as follows: the first day of the month will be used in the 
calculations if the day part of a start date is missing while January 1 will be employed if 
both the month and day parts of a start date are missing. 
 
Stop Dates 
x If only the day of resolution is unknown, the day w ill be assumed to be  the last day of the 
month (e.g., ??-JAN-2013 will be treated as 31-JAN-2013).  
x If both the day and month of resolution are unknown, the event will be assumed to have ceased on the last day of the year (e.g., ??-??? -2013 will be treated as 31-DEC-2013).  
x If the stop date is completely missing and the event is not continuing, the event will be assumed to be after first application of study drug and will be imputed using the last 
known date on the study. 
 For the start dates of current molluscum episode and initial diagnosis, the day will be estimated 
as “01” if only day is missing. If both month and day are missing, then it will be estimated as 
“01-JUN- YYYY” or the subject’s date of  birth, whichever is latest.

If the start date of current molluscum episode is partial, then the following imputation will be made: 
x If only the day is unknown, the day will be assumed to be the first day of the month or the date of birth, whichever is later. 
x If the day and month are missing, then the start date will be estimated to be June 1
st or the 
date of birth, whichever is later. 
 Standard Calculations Variables requiring calculation will be derived using the following formulas: 
x Days  – A duration expressed in days between 1 da te (date1) and another later date (date2) is 
calculated using the formulas noted below: 
Duration in days = date2 – date1 + 1. 
x Months – A duration expressed in months will be calculated as (later date – earlier date + 
1)/(30.4167). 
x Years – A duration expressed in years will  be calculated as (later date – earlier date + 
1)/(365).  
x Change from Baseline – Change from Base line will be calculated as follows: 
Change from Baseline = postbaseline value – baseline value. 
x Percent change from Baseline – Change from Baseline w ill be calculated as follows: 
Percent change from Baseli ne = (postbaseline value – baseline value)/baseline value  
× 100.

Appendix C: SAS Programming QC Requirements  
Derived datasets are independently programmed by two programmers. The separate datasets 
produced by the 2 programmers must match 100%. Detailed specifications for the derived 
datasets are documented in the study analysis dataset specifications provided to the client at 
study conclusion.  
Tables are independently reprogrammed by a second programmer for numeric results.  
Listings are checked for consistency against co rresponding tables, figures, and derived datasets. 
Figures are checked for consistency against corr esponding tables and listings, or independently 
reprogrammed if there are no corresponding tables or listings. 
The entire set of TLFs is checked for completeness and consistency prior to its delivery to the 
client by the lead biostatistician and a senior level, or above, reviewer.

1. INTRODUCTION  
This document outlines the statistical methods to be implemented during the analyses of data 
collected within the scope of Novan, Inc.  protocol version 1.0 [A Phase 3 Multi -Center, 
Randomized, Double -Blind, Vehicle -Controlled, Parallel Group Study Comparing the Efficacy 
and Safety of SB206 and Vehicle Gel Once Daily in the Treatment of Molluscum Contagiosum ]. 
The purpose of this plan is to provide specific guidelines from which the statistical analys es will 
proceed. Any deviations from this plan  will be documented in the clinical study report.  
2. STUDY DOCUMENTS  
The following study documents are used for the preparation of the statistical analysis plan ( SAP): 
• Protocol version  1.0, 26Mar2019  
• Annotated electronic case report form (e CRF ) version  3.0, 14Aug 2019  
• Data management plan version 1.0, 12Apr2019  
3. STUDY  OBJECTIVES  
The objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of SB206 12% once daily (QD)  
for the treatment of molluscum contagiosum ( MC). 
4. STUDY DESIGN AND PLAN  
This is a Phase 3 multi -center, randomized, double -blind, vehicle -controlled, parallel group study 
to be conducted in approximately 340 subjects ≥6 months of age  with MC. After obtaining 
informed consent/assent, subjects who satisfy e ntry criteria will be randomized  to a 2:1 
(active:vehicle)  scheme . Subjects receiving current treatment for MC at the time of the Screening 
Visit will enter a washout period of up to 14 days prior to randomization. In the event no 
washout period is require d, Screening and Baseline visit activities may be combined into a single 
visit. At randomization, subjects will be stratified into 4 strata corresponding to the cross -
classification of household number of random ly assign ed subjects (1 subject per household  vs 2 
subjects per household) and investigator type (dermatologist vs other). Households randomizing 
2 subjects will receive the same treatment a ssignment for both subjects. Up to 2 subjects from 
the same household may be random ly assign ed on the same day,  if both individually meet all 
inclusion  and exclusion criteria. For subjects in the same household, Screening can occur on 
different days; however, the baseline visit must occur on the same day . 
Subjects or their caregivers will apply SB206 12% or Vehicle Gel QD for a minimum of 4 weeks 
and up to 12 weeks to all lesions identified at Baseline and new treatable lesions that arise during 
the course of the study. Subjects or their caregivers will con tinue to treat the area until the next 
scheduled visit even if the lesion(s) clear. If the investigator determines all lesions are cleared at 
a clinic visit, the treatment may stop. At Weeks 2, 4, 8 and 12, the investigator will count and 
record the number  of active (raised, treatable) molluscum lesions per body area. At Weeks 2, 4, 
Page 83/117
and 8, the investigator will determine if new lesions have occurred since the last visit, and t he 
subject or caregiver will be instructed by the investigator  to re-initiate trea tment. If treatment is 
stopped due to clearance, subjects will continue regularly scheduled visits through Week 2 4. 
Subjects will visit the clinic at Screening /Baseline, Week 2, Week 4, Week 8, Week 12 , and 
Week 24 . Subjects will be contacted via phone on Day 2 to collect subject information on early 
dose reactions. At Weeks 16 and 20, subjects will be contacted via phone to capture information 
regarding MC recurrence and adverse events ( AEs); at Week 24, the subject will be seen at the 
site for a final stu dy visit to assess scarring, keloid, and MC recurrence.  Subjects who 
discontinue the study prior to the Week 12 visit due to AEs or other reasons  will be asked to 
complete the Week 12 visit assessments : this will be recorded as an Early Termination  (ET1) 
visit. No study drug treatment will be provided after the Week 12 visit. Subjects who discontinue 
from the study after Week 12 but prior to Week 24 will be asked to come to the site to complete 
Week 24 assessments ; this will be recorded as an ET2 visit . 
Safety assessments include local skin reactions (LSRs), AE collection , including scarring/keloid , 
and urine pregnancy tests. Safety assessments will be completed at specified site visits through 
Week 12. After Week 12, safety information for ongoing AEs and n ew AEs will be collected, 
along with information regarding household MC occurrence.  
Inflammatory reactions around the MC has been associated with imminent resolution of MC 
(sometimes referred to as “beginning -of-the-end” [“BOTE”] sign). The investigator (o r 
designated evaluator) will assess the presence and overall degree of inflammatory reactions at 
MC lesions at Baseline ( before dosing ) and Weeks 2  through 12. In most cases, clinical features 
can differentiate between BOTE and LSR. BOTE may be associated with itch, but not pain. 
BOTE is usually asymptomatic, self -limited,  and localized to individual MC lesions and does not 
require discontinuation of study treatment or additional treatment. LSR is generally more diffuse, 
associated with significa nt itch or tenderness, may necessitate discontinuation of study treatment , 
and may need treatment for symptomatic relief (e.g. , a topical corticosteroid or topical 
anesthetic). For very severe LSR, systemic corticosteroids may be considered. Investigators will 
assess the treatment a rea at each scheduled visit and use their medical judgement to differentiate 
between BOTE and LSRs. BOTE Inflammation Score and LSR score will be recorded at each 
visit. BOTE should not be considered an AE. When LSRs are clinical ly significant at the 
application site, the investigator should report the condition as an AE(s).  
At Baseline ( at least 30 min utes after dosing ) and Weeks 2  through 12, the investigator s will rate 
LSRs on individual features including erythema, flaking/sca ling, crusting, swelling, 
vesiculation/pustulation, and erosion/ulceration . At Baseline (pre -dose) and  Weeks 2  through 12, 
the investigators will rate BOTE signs  using the BOTE Inflammation Score .  
The following tables describe the scoring parameters for t he BOTE Inflammation Score and LSR 
score.

Clinically significant LSRs that are reported as AEs and/or subject -reported intolerability (i.e. , 
itching, pain) may result in an investigator -directed temporary treatment hold (drug holiday), and 
topical corticosteroids may be used to treat LSRs for up t o 2 weeks. The subject may re -initiate 
study drug treatment prior to the next scheduled visit. Upon re -initiation of study drug treatment, 
if a subject develops worsening LSRs, allergic contact dermatitis may be suspected. The 
investigator may take photogr aphs of the suspected allergic contact dermatitis and discuss 
possible confirmation of allergic contact dermatitis with the contract research organization ’s 
Page 85/117
(CRO ) medical monitor. The investigator should also discuss the necessity of patch testing with 
the subject/caregiver. The investigator will then discontinue the subject from study drug 
treatment a nd treat the area(s) with corticosteroids for up to 2 weeks. If the subject provides 
consent/assent, the investigator will consult with the CRO ’s medical monitor to implement the 
process for patch testing.  
Adverse events will be assessed and collected after the initiation of study drug treatment through 
the end of the subject’s last visit. Treatment -related AEs will be followed up until resolution  or 
up to 1 year after last treatment, whichever is sooner.  
Scar formation will be assessed starting at the Week 4 visit through Week 12 and again at 
Week  24. The investigator will map locations of the molluscum lesions at Baseline. Additional 
lesions ide ntified through Week 12 will be added to the map. Using the map as a guidance, the 
investigator will assess the treated areas for scar/keloid formation. The investigator will count 
and record the number of active (raised, treatable) molluscum lesions per b ody area. If a new 
scar is noted after the subject treated with study drug , this will be considered an AE for the 
purposes of this study. In addition, keloid/hypertrophic scars will also be recorded as AEs.  
If a subject’s treatment is discontinued by the investigator  or the subject because of an AE, that 
AE should be indicated as the reason for treatment discontinuation.  All subjects will be 
encouraged to remain in the study throughout the 24-week study duration.  
When approximately 200 subjects (cumulative  across studies MC301 and MC302 ) have 
completed 4 weeks of treatment , a data safety monitoring board (DSMB) will review all 
available unblinded safety data  (including patch testing) .  
5. DETERMINATION OF SAMPLE SIZE  
Approximately 340 subjects, 6 months of age and older, with a minimum of 3 and a maximum of 
70 MC lesions at Baseline will be randomized  in a 2:1 (active:vehicle) scheme. The sample size 
assumptions for this study were informed by the completed Phase 2 stu dy NI -MC201 of subjects 
2 years of age  and older  with between 3 and 70 MC lesions at Baseline. In the Intent -to-Treat 
(ITT) Population of the Phase 2 study, the observed rates of complete clearance at Week 12 were 
18% (12/66) for vehicle and 38% (18/48) for SB206 12% QD and the covariate -adjusted 
treatment difference was 18%.  
A sample size of 340 subjects (227 subjects in the SB206 12% QD group and 113 subjects in the 
vehicle group) will p rovide 94% power for a 2 -sided alpha test of size 0.05 to detect an absolute 
difference of 18% when the vehicle response rate is 18%. This same sample size provides 93% 
power to detect a treatment difference of 18% when the vehicle response rate is 20% and  83% 
power when the treatment difference is 15% and the vehicle response rate is 20%.  
Since the intra -cluster correlation is estimated to be small (<10%) and the average size of 
households is expected to be capped at roughly 1.3, the sample size is still sufficient when 
considering  the fact that the subjects within the household may not be independent.  
Page 86/117
6. GENERAL ANALYSIS CONSIDERATIONS  
The statistical analyses will be reported using summary tables, listings , and figures (TLFs) . The 
International Council for  Harmoni sation (ICH) numbering convention will be used for all TLFs. 
Unless otherwise noted, all statistical testing will be 2-sided and will be performed at the 0.05 
significance level. Tests will be declared statistically significant if the calculated P-value is 
≤0.05 .  
Continuous variable summaries will include the number of subjects (n) with non -missing values, 
mean, standard deviation (SD), median, minimum, and maximum. Other statistics such as 
quartiles, confidence intervals (CIs), and number of missin g values may be added as appropriate.  
Categorical variable summaries will include the frequency and percentage of subjects who are in 
the category or each possible value. In general, the denominator for the percentage calculation 
will be based upon the total number of subjects in the study pop ulation within each treatment 
group, unless otherwise specified. The denominator for by -visit displays will be the number of 
subjects in the relevant study population with non -missing data at each visit.  
All summary tables will be presented by treatment g roup. Baseline summaries will also include 
an overall  summary column .  
Individual subject  data obtained from the  eCRFs  and any derived data will generally be 
presented by subject  in data listings.  Additionally, a listing of the subjects requir ing a narrati ve 
because they experience one of the following events: serious adverse event, death, discontinued 
the study due to an AE, hypertrophic or keloid scarring, unresolved scars, or LSR suggestive of 
allergic contact dermatitis will be presented.  
The analyses described in this plan are considered a priori, in tha t they have been defined prior to 
breaking the blind.  
Any analyses performed subsequent to breaking the blind will be considered post  hoc and 
exploratory. Post hoc analyses will be labeled as such on the output and identified in the clinical 
study report . 
All analyses and tabulations will be performed using SAS software Version 9.4 or higher. 
Tables , listings , and figures  will be presented in RTF format.  
The pr ocess for SAS program validation and quality control (QC) for programs and outputs is 
documented in the Synteract working instruction “SAS programming quality control .” 
Study -specific QC requirements can be found in Appendix C: SAS Programming QC 
Requirements . 
 
The study treatment period is defined from randomization through completion of Week 12/ET1 
visit and the safety follow -up period is from the completion of Week 12 through the completion 
of Week 24/ET2 visit.  
Page 87/117
 
After all subjects have completed their Week 12/ET1 visit, thus completing the Treatment Period 
of the study, the database through Week 12/ET1 will be frozen and unblinded for purposes of the 
primary an alysis of efficacy and safety.   While this analysis is being prepared, the subjects will 
continue through Week 24/ET2. After all subjects have completed their Week 24/ET2 visit, the 
database will be locked and the follow -up data will be analyzed.  
7. NOTATION OF TREATMENT GROUP S AND VISITS  
Analysis visits  
 
Baseline is defined as the last nonmissing value recorded prior to the first application of study 
drug. If time is not recorded and the assessment was on the same day as the first application of 
study drug, t hen it will be assumed the assessment occurred prior to the application of study drug. 
The baseline record will have an analysis visit of “Baseline”.  
 
For all evaluations of all parameters , assessments will be analyzed according to the visit at which 
they occurred (i.e. , per the eCRF visit label). In order to account for the fact that the Week 12 and 
Early Termination visits are collected on the same eCRF  in the database, a check against the Study 
Exit form will be made to determine if the visit is a W eek 12 or an Early Termination Visit. If the 
visit is an Early Termination visit, then the visit will be mapped according to the table below. If 
there is no corresponding Study Exit form on the same date, then it will be considered a Week 12 
visit. If ther e is no assessment in a given visit, then the following visit windows  will be applied  to 
determine if an unscheduled visit may be used : 
 
Visit  Analysis Visit  Target Study 
Day Study Day  Analysis 
Window  
    
Week 2 (±3 days)  Week 2  15 Day 12  to 22 
Week 4 (±5 days)  Week 4  29 Day 23  to 43 
Week 8 (±5 days)  Week 8  57 Day 44  to 71 
Week 12 (±5 days)  Week 12  85 Day 72 to 98  
 
Days are measured from the date of randomi zation. Study days corresponding to measurements 
are calculated as:  
• Assessment date – date of randomi zation + 1, if assessment date is on or after the date of 
randomi zation.  
• Assessment date – date of randomi zation, if measurement date is before the date of 
randomi zation.  
In the event of multiple unscheduled records falling in the same analysis window, the assessment 
which is closest to the target study day will be chosen for analysis.  
Page 88/117
8. ANALYSIS POPULATIONS  
The following subject population will be used for disposition analy ses:  
• The Enrolled Population will consist of all subjects who have a signed informed consent  
or assent . If a subject is random ly assign ed to a treatment , then t reatment assignment will 
be based on randomized treatment ; otherwise, they will be deemed a scr een failure and 
will only appear in the overall summary  columns of output . 
The following subject  population will be used for safety analyses:  
• The Safety  Population will consist of all subjects who receive at least 1 application of 
study medication . Treatm ent a ssignment will be based on the treatment a ctually received.  
If a subject receives any amount of SB206, then they will be summarized in the SB206 
12% QD arm.  
The following subject  populations will be used for efficacy analyses:  
• The ITT Population will consist of all subjects who are  randomized . Treatment 
assignment will be based on the randomized treatment.   
• The Per-Protocol (PP) Population will consist of all subjects in the ITT Population who 
had no significant protocol deviations that impacted the analyses of efficacy endpoints. 
Final determination of subject inclusion in the PP Population will be made prior to 
unblinding. Treatment a ssignment will be based on the randomized treatment . 
9. STUDY POPULATION  
9.1 Subject  Disposition  
Subject  disposition information will be summarized for all subject s by treatment group. 
Summaries will include: the number of subject s screened, the number of subject s in each 
analysis population , the number of subject s where study treatment stopped, primary reason  for 
study treatment stopped, the number of subject s completing 12 weeks of the study  (defined as 
having an end of treatment reason of “Completed Treatment Per Protoco l” or a reason of 
“Complete Clearance Prior to Week 12” and does not have a Study Exit date prior to the 
subject’s  Week 12 visit date ), the number of subjects completed the study , and the primary 
reason for discontinuation.  
 
A summar y of the number of subjects in each center  and each population will be presented.  
9.2 Eligibility  
A listing of subject s not fulfilling  any eligibility criteria will be created.  
Page 89/117
9.3 Demographic and Baseline Characteristics  
Demographic variables include age, sex, ethnicity, and race. Age will be calculated in years 
relative to the informed consent date.  
Other baseline characteristics include lesion counts at baseline, site type ( dermatologist vs other) , 
number of sites and a  breakdown of site type , number of random ly assign ed subjects in 
household (1 subject vs 2 subjects) , number of households and breakdown of household size, age 
at and time since initial clinical diagnosis of the current molluscum episode  and age at and time 
since onset of symptoms of current molluscum episode . Descriptive statistics will be presented 
for age s and other continuous variables. Frequency counts and percentages will be presented for 
sex, ethnicity, race  and other c ategorical variables . Demographic and baseline characteristics will 
be summarized for the Safety, ITT, and PP Populati ons.  
9.4 Extent of Exposure  
Study drug exposure will be summarized for each treatment using the total number of 
applications, the duration of treatment, and the nu mber of subjects requiring a treatment 
interruption and modification. Duration of treatment is defined as the last application date minus 
the first application date plus 1 . 
Study drug compliance will be summarized and calculated as follows:  
Compliance [%] = (Actual applications applied)/(Planned applications) ×100, where  
• Actual applications applied = Planned applications – the number of applications missed  
• Planned applications = Number of applications (days) planned up to the point of 
treatment discontinuat ion or date of Week 12 visit, whichever is later .  
This implies that if a subject treatment discontinues treatment prior to Week 12 due to complete 
clearance, then the number of applications takes this information into account and the subject is 
not penali zed for having complete clearance.  
Compliance will be further summarized into 2 groups:  
1. Subjects who did not have any interruptions or modifications using the same formula as 
above, and  
2. Subjects with modifications or interruptions. For these subjects, an  adjusted compliance 
will be calculated in the following manner:  the actual applications applied will be the 
same as above but the planned applications will exclude the time where the subject has 
dosing interrupted.  
Page 90/117
9.5 Protocol Deviations  
Significant  protocol deviations that could potentially affect the efficacy or safety conclusions of 
the study will be identified prior to database lock and unblinding  of individual subject treatment 
information.  Significant  protocol deviations may include,  but are not limited to:  
• Randomly assigned subjects who did not satisfy selected inclusion and exclusion criteria  
• Randomly assigned subjects who developed withdrawal criteria during the study but were 
not withdrawn  
• Subjects who were randomized incorrectly including subjects of the same household who 
are randomized to different treatments  
• Subjects who received the wrong treatment  
• Subjects where the subject/site staff were unproperly unblinded  
• Week 12 Lesion Count not  performed  
• Subjects who received an excluded concomitant treatment . 
The decision on the criteria for whether a subject is excluded from the PP Population will be 
made during the data review meeting  prior to unblinding and database lock . Reasons for 
exclusi on of a subject from the analysis will be listed.  
A listing of all protocol deviations including the deviation designation (major or minor  and 
significant or not ), category, and indication of whether the deviation led to an exclusion of a 
subject from the PP Population will be presented in a data listing.   
Major and significant protocol deviations will be summarized by deviation category and 
treatment group.  
9.6 Medical History  
Medical history verbatim terms in the eCRFs will be mapped to system organ class es and 
preferred terms using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA ) Version 22.0. 
Subject incidence of unique medical history terms by MedDRA system organ class and preferred 
term will be presented. The summary will be ordered by descendin g order of incidence of system 
organ class and preferred term within each system organ class . 
9.7 Prior and Concomitant Medications  
Prior and concomitant medication v erbatim terms in the  eCRFs will be mapped to 
anatomical/ therapeutic/ chemical (ATC) class  and preferred  names using the WHODrug  Global 
B3 (version March 2019 ). Prior medications are those medications started prior to the first 
application of study drug . Concomitant medications are those medications started on or after the 
date of first application of study drug  or medications started prior to initial application of study 
Page 91/117
drug and continued during the study . A medication can be classified as both prior and 
concomitant. If it cannot be determined whether the medication was a prior (or concomitant) 
medication due to a partial start or stop date , then it will be counted as both prior and 
concomitant ; see Appendix B for the imputation of missing dates algorithm.  
Prior and concomitant medications will be summarized  for each treatment b y WHO Drug  Global  
ATC class Level 3 and preferred  name. These summaries will present the number and percentage 
of subject s using each medication . Subject s may have more than 1 medication per ATC class  and 
preferred  name . At each level of subject  summarization, a subject is counted once if he/she 
reported 1 or more medications at that level. Each summary will be ordered by descending order 
of incidence of ATC class and preferred  name  within each ATC class.  
10. EFFICACY ANALYSES  
The primary efficacy analysis will be based on the ITT Population . Additional supportive 
efficacy analyses will be performed using the PP Population . 
10.1 Efficacy Endpoints  
The primary efficacy endpoint is the proportion of subjects with complete clearance of all 
treatable MC at Week 12 .  
The s econdary efficacy endpoint  is the proportion of subjects with complete clearance of all 
treatable MC at Week  8.  
Complete clearance is defined as having a total number of lesions count of 0.  
The exploratory endpoints are the following:  
• Proportion of subjects with complete clearance of all treatable MC at Week 2 and Week 4 
visits  
• Proportion of subjects achieving at l east a 95% reduction from Baseline in the number of 
all treatable MC at each visit (Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12)  
• Proportion of subjects achieving at least a 90% reduction from Baseline in the number of 
all treatable MC at each visit (Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12)  
• Proportion of  subjects  achieving at least a 75% reduction from Baseline in the number of 
all treatable MC at each visit (Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12)  
• Percent change from Baseline in number of treatable MC at each visit (Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12)  
• Change from Baseline in number of treata ble MC at each visit (Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12)  
• Proportion of subjects who have a recurrence of MC  after the first visit at which complete 
clearance was observed , defined as the total lesion count being greater than 0 at any point 
after achieving a count of 0  
Page 92/117
• Time to complete clearance of all treatable MC, defined as the days between the date of 
first dose and the first date of clearance. Subjects who do not achieve complete clearance 
will be censored at the date of the last lesion count assessment.  
• Proportion of  subjects with scarring , defined as an answer of Yes to either question on the 
Scarring/Keloid Assessment eCRF page : “Was the presence of a scar  > 1 mm deep and/or 
5 mm wide noted?”  or “Was the presence of a scar noted?” , after clearance of lesion(s) at 
each visit (Weeks 4, 8, 12, 24)  
• Proportion of subjects with kel oid or hypertrophic scar, defined as an answer of Yes to 
the Scarring/Keloid Assessment eCRF page question “Was the presence of a keloid or 
hypertrophic scar  noted?”, after clearance of lesion(s)  at each visit (Weeks 4, 8, 12, 24)  
• Change from Baseline of the composite score from age -matched (at Baseline) 
Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) or Children’s Dermatology Life Quality Index 
(CLDQI) assessment at Week 12  
• Subject -reported spread to household members as measured by any new occurrence of 
MC in household members of subjects at each visit (Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12 , 16, 20, 24 ) 
10.2 Baseline Values  
Unless otherwise noted, baseline is defined as the last nonmissing value recorded prior to the 
first application  of study drug . If time is not recorded and the assessment was on the same day as 
the first application of study drug, then it will be assumed the assessment occurred  prior to the 
application  of study drug . If a subject was randomized but not trea ted, then baseline is defined as 
the last nonmissing value on or before the date of randomization.  
10.3 Adjustments for Covariates  
The model for the primary efficacy will include adjustments for the following covariates: 
investigator type (dermatologist vs other), household number of randomized  subjects (1 subject 
per household vs 2 subjects per household), age, and baseline lesion count.  If there are not at 
least 3 responders and non -responders at each level of the stratification factors, then that 
stratification factor will be removed from the model. If there are fewer than 10 
responders/non -responders, then neither investigator type nor  household number of randomized 
subjects will be included in the model.  
10.4 Handling of Dropouts or Missing Data  
In analyses based on respon se, a missing response  will be considered a nonresponder.  
For a sensitivity analys is, subjects with missing lesion count at Week 12 but who demonstrated 
complete clearance at the last collected  lesion assessment will be counted as responders.  
Page 93/117
10.5 Interim Analys is and Data Monitoring  
When approximately 200 subjects (cumulative across studies NI-MC301 and NI-MC302) h ave 
completed 4 weeks of treatment, a DSMB will review all available unblinded safety data 
(including patch testing). All responsibilities of the DSMB and details of the analysis and data to 
be reviewed is detailed in the DSMB charter.  
10.6 Examination of Subgr oups  
Subgroup analys es of complete clearance at Week 12 for investigator type (dermatologist vs 
other) and household number of randomized  subjects (1 subject per household vs 2 subjects per 
household) , and will be presented in a forest plot  for the ITT Population.  An additional subgroup 
analysis of complete clearance at Week 12 for age ( <1 year old, ≥1 to <2 years old, ≥2 to <6 
years old, ≥6 to <12 years old, ≥12 to <18 years old, ≥18 years old) and onset of MC symptoms 
duration prior to bas eline (≤6 months vs >6 months)  will be summarized descriptively for the 
ITT Population.  
10.7 Multiple Comparison/ Multiplicity  
The familywise error rate with respect to the primary endpoint and secondary endpoint will be  
strongly controlled at the alpha=0.05 lev el using a fixed -sequence method testing strategy. If the  
primary endpoint is not statistically significant at the alpha=0.05 level, the secondary efficacy  
endpoint will be considered not significant. If the primary endpoint is statistically significant at  
the alpha=0.05 level, then the secondary efficacy endpoint will be analyzed.  If the secondary 
efficacy endpoint fails to reach statistical significance at the alpha=0.05 level, it will be 
considered not statistically significant . 
10.8 Multicenter Studies  
This is a multicenter study , having approximately 35 centers participating in the study . The 
center effects will be investigated in the primary statistical analysis model  by including the 
treatment by investigator type interaction . As exploratory a nalyses to examine the variability of 
the treatment effect across centers, the following analyses will be performed:  
• Pool the centers into self -standing center pools of at least 1 7 subjects. The pooling will 
sort by investigator type and number of randomiz ed subjects. Then, the centers with 
fewer than 17 subjects will be pooled until the self-stand ing center pool is at least 1 7 
subjects.  The treatment effect will be explored using a logistic model including treatment, 
household number of randomly assigned s ubjects, age, baseline lesion counts , and a strata 
statement which will include the pooling identified  and examining the residual score 
statistic s. To address treatment*center interaction, e ach pooling center will have a 
corresponding variable coded as 1 i f on SB206 and 0 otherwise. Some pooled centers 
may have a p -value of less than 0.05 by chance since there will be multiple pooled 
centers.  
Page 94/117
• Pool the centers using the method above b ut the self -standing center pools will contain at 
least 10 subjects . This analysis should be interpreted with caution due to the small sample 
size within pooled centers . 
11. METHODS OF EFFICACY ANALYSIS  
11.1 Primary Efficacy Analys is 
The primary efficacy comparison will test the following hypotheses:  
H0: The proportion of subjects w ith complete clearance is equal between SB206 12% QD and 
Vehicle ; 
H1: The proportion of subjects with complete clearance is different between SB206 12% QD 
and Vehicle .  
 
The primary efficacy model will be the following  for 𝜋𝐻𝑖 as the probability of complete 
clearance for the ith subject in household H: 
 
𝜋𝐻𝑖= 𝑒(𝛽0+𝛽1∗𝑋𝐻𝑖1 + 𝛽2∗𝑋𝐻𝑖2+ 𝛽3∗𝑋𝐻𝑖3+ 𝛽4∗𝑋𝐻𝑖4+ 𝛽5∗𝑋𝐻𝑖5 )
1+ 𝑒(𝛽0+𝛽1∗𝑋𝐻𝑖1 + 𝛽2∗𝑋𝐻𝑖2+ 𝛽3∗𝑋𝐻𝑖3+ 𝛽4∗𝑋𝐻𝑖4+ 𝛽5∗𝑋𝐻𝑖5 )  
 
where H = Household, i = subject  within the household, 𝛽0 is the intercept,  
𝑋𝐻𝑖1={1,𝑖𝑓 𝑡𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑡𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡  𝑖𝑠 𝑆𝐵206   
0,𝑖𝑓 𝑡𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑡𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡  𝑖𝑠 𝑉𝑒ℎ𝑐𝑖𝑙𝑒 
 
𝑋𝐻𝑖2={1,𝑖𝑓 𝑠𝑢𝑏𝑗𝑒𝑐𝑡  𝑖𝑠 𝑓𝑟𝑜𝑚  𝑎 2 𝑠𝑢𝑏𝑗𝑒𝑐𝑡  ℎ𝑜𝑢𝑠𝑒 ℎ𝑜𝑙𝑑
0,𝑖𝑓 𝑠𝑢𝑏𝑗𝑒𝑐𝑡  𝑖𝑠 𝑓𝑟𝑜𝑚  𝑎 1 𝑠𝑢𝑏𝑗𝑒𝑐𝑡  ℎ𝑜𝑢𝑠𝑒 ℎ𝑜𝑙𝑑 
 
𝑋𝐻𝑖3={1,𝑖𝑓 𝑠𝑢𝑏𝑗𝑒𝑐𝑡  𝑖𝑠 𝑓𝑟𝑜𝑚  𝑎 𝐷𝑒𝑟𝑚𝑎𝑡𝑜𝑙𝑜𝑔𝑦  𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑒
0,𝑖𝑓 𝑠𝑢𝑏𝑗𝑒𝑐𝑡  𝑖𝑠 𝑓𝑟𝑜𝑚  𝑎𝑛 𝑂𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑟 𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑒               
 
𝑋𝐻𝑖4is the subject’s basel ine lesion count, and 𝑋𝐻𝑖4is the subject’s age at baseline ; treatment will 
be included in the class statement with PARAM=REF and REF=Vehicle.  The working 
correlation will have an exchangeable structure. The  model will include a repeated statement for 
subject household  with household ID in the class statement . Also, the data structure will be 
ordered according to household ID and subject ID in household.  
 
Treatment groups will be compared  using a generalized estimating equation for logistic 
regression with an exchangeable working correlation structure. The model will include 
treatment, investigator type (dermatologist vs other), household number of random ly assign ed 
subjects (1 subject per household vs 2 subjects per household), age , and baseline lesion count  as 
factors. The odds ratio between SB206 12% and vehicle gel, 95% confidence intervals for the 
odds ratio, and P-value for the covariate -adjusted treatment comparison will be presented; 
Page 95/117
together with predicted proportions along with their associated 95% confidence interval . The 
difference in proportion confidence interval  will be calculated using the following formula:  
 
(𝑝𝑆𝐵206− 𝑝𝑉𝑒ℎ𝑖𝑐𝑙𝑒) ± 𝑧0.025∗∗ 𝑆𝐸 
 
Where the SE =  
√𝑝𝑆𝐵2062(1−𝑝𝑆𝐵206)2 𝑠𝑆𝐵2062+ 𝑝𝑉𝑒ℎ𝑖𝑐𝑙𝑒2(1−𝑝𝑉𝑒ℎ𝑖𝑐𝑙𝑒)2 𝑠𝑉𝑒ℎ𝑖𝑐𝑙𝑒2−2𝑝𝑆𝐵206(1−𝑝𝑆𝐵206)𝑝𝑉𝑒ℎ𝑖𝑐𝑙𝑒 
(1−𝑝𝑉𝑒ℎ𝑖𝑐𝑙𝑒)∗(𝑠𝑆𝐵2062+𝑠𝑉𝑒ℎ𝑖𝑐𝑙𝑒2− 𝑠𝑂𝑑𝑑𝑠  𝑅𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜2
2) 
The 𝑝𝑆𝐵206 and 𝑝𝑉𝑒ℎ𝑖𝑐𝑙𝑒 are the transformed predicted log odds at the mean of the covariates, s2’s 
are the standard errors of the predicted log odds and the odds ratio.  
As a s ensitivity analys is, the above primary analysis model will be applied to the PP Population . 
An additional sensitivity analysis  counting subjects who discontinued prior to Week  12 or have a 
missing lesion count assessment but who demonstrated complete clearance at the last collected 
lesion assessment as responders will be presented.  The impact of mis -stratifications may be 
explored via a sensitivity analysis.   
An analysis where the complete clearance response probability for each dropout prior to Week 
12 will be independently generated across the following scenarios (Vehicle response probability, 
SB206 response probability):  
 
(0.1, 0.1) (0.1, 0.0)    
(0.2, 0.2) (0.2, 0.1)  (0.2, 0.0)   
(0.3, 0.3) (0.3, 0.2)  (0.3, 0.1)  (0.3, 0.0)   
(0.4, 0.4) (0.4, 0.3)  (0.4, 0.2)  (0.4, 0.1)  (0.4, 0.0)  
 
The analysis will be produced  100 times and then the results  for the estimated log odds ratio for 
treatment and its estimated standard error from each of the imputations will be combined using 
PROC MIANALYZE.  
An additional sensitivity analysis will be performed in a subset of the ITT population where only 
1 subject  from each household is chosen to contribute to the model based on the subject with the 
highest number of baseline treatable MC and the oldest to break ties, if needed. A logistic 
regression model including treatment, investigator type, age, and baseline l esion counts will be 
utilized . 
11.2 Secondary Efficacy Analyses  
The secondary endpoint of the proportion of subjects with complete clearance of all treatable MC 
at Week 8 will be analyzed in the same manner as the primary endpoint. A sensitivity analysis 
using the PP Population  will be provided.  
Page 96/117
11.3 Exploratory Analyses  
The exploratory  endpoint s based on the proportion of subjects  achieving complete clearance or 
75%, 90%, or 95%  reduction s will be analyzed in the same manner as the primary endpoint.  
Since the within -household correlation is expected to be small and the change and percent 
change from Baseline in the number of treatable MC are explorat ory, they will be analyzed using 
a repeated measures mixed model for the respective visits with the sam e covariates as the 
primary model  together with visits and treatment by visit; an unstructured covariance matrix  will 
be utilized . If the calculation of the percent  change from baseline is influenced by outliers with 
calculated values >100%, then the influ ence of outliers will be avoided for analysis by censoring 
them so that all values were in the range of -100% to 100%.  If the model fails to converge, then 
other correlation structures will be explored.  
Since the within -household correlation is expected to be small and t ime to first complete 
clearance of all MC is exploratory, it will be analyzed using Kaplan -Meier methods. The number 
and percentage of subjects achieving complete clearance, number and percentage of censored 
subjects, and Kaplan -Meier estimates of first quartile, median, and third quartile will be 
summarized by treatment group. Differences in Kaplan -Meier curves between the treatments will 
be tested for significance using a stratified log-rank test.  
The proportion of subjects with scarring and the proportion of subjects with keloid or 
hypertrophic scarring will be summarized descriptively at each visit.  
The change from Baseline of the composite score from age -matched (at Baseline) DLQI /CDLQI 
will be summarized descriptively  and separately for each questionnaire . The scoring algorithm s 
are detailed in Appendix A.  The CDLQI will be examined in the following  Week 12  response 
categories: complete clearance, 95% reduction in lesion counts , 90% reduction in lesion counts , 
and subjects who did not achieve complete clearance . Additionally, the changes from Baseline in 
the following subscales: Symptoms and Feelings, Daily Activities, Leisure, Work and School, 
Personal Relationships, and Treatment,  for DLQI , and Symptoms and Feelings, Leisure, School 
or Holidays, Personal Relationships, Sleep, and Treatment, for CDLQI, and each question will be 
summarized descriptively.  
The subject -reported spread of MC to household members not in the study will be summarized 
descriptively including a breakdown of whether or not there was any spread and then a 
breakdown of the amount of spread within the household at each visit  at the household level .  
12. OTHER ANALYSES  
The following analyses of BOTE vs lesion count/complete clearance will be presented:  
• Percent chan ge from Baseline at Week 12 in relation to the highest BOTE score during 
treatment.  
• Complete clearance at Week 12 in relation to the highest BOTE score during treatment.  
Page 97/117
• Percent change from Baseline at each visit in relation to BOTE score at Week 2.  
• Comple te clearance at each visit in relation to BOTE score at Week 2.  
In these analyses, the BOTE scores will be analyzed in the ITT Population as follows:  
1. Dichotomized:  
a. Score of 0 or 1: No to Mild  
b. Score of 2, 3, or 4: Moderate to Very Severe  
A shift table comparing the baseline BOTE score to each scheduled postbaseline assessment will 
be presented  for the Safety Population .  
13. SAFETY ANALYSES  
All safety analyses will be based on the Safety  Population . 
 
A listing of all deaths will be presented.  
13.1 Adverse Events  
All AE summaries will be restricted to treatment -emergent A Es (TEAE s), which are defined as 
those AEs that occurred any time on or after the first in -clinical application of study drug through 
the last application of study medication and those exist ing AEs that worsened during th is same 
period . If it cannot be determined whether the AE is treatment emergent due to a partial onset 
date, then it will be counted as such ; see Appendix B for the imputation of missing dates 
algorithm . Verbatim terms in the eCRFs  will be mapped to preferred terms and system organ 
classes using the MedDRA Version 22.0.  
Each AE summary will be displayed by treatment group. Summaries that are displayed by 
system organ class es and preferred terms will be ordered by descending o rder of incidence of 
system organ class and preferred term within each system organ class.  Summaries of the 
following types will be presented:  
• Overall summary of TEAEs that contain an overview of each item below.  
• Subject  incidence of TEAEs and total number of unique TEAEs by MedDRA system 
organ class and preferred term.   
• Subject  incidence of TEAEs by MedDRA system organ class, preferred term, and 
maximum  severity.  At each level of subject  summarization , a subject  is class ified 
according to the maximum  severity if the subject  reported 1 or more events.  Adverse 
event s with missing severity will be considered severe for this summary.  
Page 98/117
• Subject  incidence of TEAEs by MedDRA system organ class, preferred term, and closest 
relation ship to study drug (Related/Not Related). Related AEs are those reported as 
“Definite ,” “Probable ,” or “Possib le,” and unrelated AEs are those reported as “Unlikely” 
or “Unrelated .” At each level of subject  summarization , a subject  is classified according 
to the closest relationship if the subject  reported 1 or more events.  Adverse event s with a 
missing relationship will be considered related for this summary.  
• Subject  incidence of serious TEAEs and total number of unique serious TEAEs by 
MedDRA system organ  class and preferred term.  
• Subject incidence of TEAEs leading to study  drug discontinuation by MedDRA system 
organ class and preferred term.  
• Subject incidence of TEAEs leading to death as an outcome by MedDRA system organ 
class and preferred term.  
Separate listings of all A Es, all SAEs and all A Es leading to study drug discontinuation will be 
provided.  
13.2 Local Skin Reaction  
The LSR composite score will be calculated by summing up all the numerical responses (0 -4) to 
each individual parameter for a co mposite score that ranges between 0 and 24. The change from 
Baseline of the LSR composite score will be summarized descriptively . A table summarizing 
each LSR parameter  (erythema, flaking/scaling, crusting, swelling, vesiculation/pustulation, and 
erosion/u lceration) score at  each scheduled postbaseline assessment will be presented.  
Additionally, a  shift table comparing the baseline score for each LSR parameter to each 
scheduled postbaseline assessment will be presented for the Safety Population . 
13.3 Events of S pecial Interest  
Events of Special Interest will include subjects with any TEAE where the preferred term contains 
“application site”, subjects with at least 1 post-baseline occurrence of moderate BOTE 
inflammation score, or subjects with at least 1 post-baseline LSR component score ≥ 1. A 
summary including the number and percentage of subjects with at least 1 event of special 
interest, AEs of interest by MedDRA system organ class and preferred term , at least 1 moderate 
BOTE inflammation score, and any LSR co mponent score ≥ 1 will be provided  for the Safety 
Population . The analysis will also be repeated with the LSR criteria revised to include any post-
baseline LSR component (excluding erythema) score ≥ 1 and erythema score ≥ 2 . 
13.4 Urine Pregnancy Test  
Urine pregnancy test results will be included in a data listing only.  
Page 99/117
13.5 Physical Examination  
A shift table summarizing the shift from Baseline to end of treatment in normal/abnormal will be 
presented.  
13.6 Patch Testing  
A table summarizing any patch testing results  by time point  may be presented.  
14. CHANGES TO PROTOCOL -SPECIFIED ANALYSES  
The following modifications  and/or clarifications to the methodology  specified in the protocol  
will be:  
• The DLQI and CDLQI will be summarized separately  
• The order of th e exploratory endpoints was updated  
• The Mean percent change in baseline endpoint was updated to be more generic in order 
to analyze the median in the case of skewness  
• Proportion of subjects with 90% and 95% clearance exploratory endpoints were added in 
order to provide additional  clinica lly meaningful  categories for analys is

Appendix B: Presentation of Data  and Programming Specifications  
General   
• Specialized text styles, such as bold, italics, borders, and shading will not be used in 
tables, figures, and data listings unless they add significant value to the table, figure, or 
data listing.  
• Only standard keyboard characters are to be used in tables and data listings.  
• Special characters, such as nonprintable control characters, printer -specific, or font -
specific characters, will not be used on a table, figure, or data listing.  
• Hexadecimal character representations are allowed ( e.g., µ, , ß). 
• All foot notes will be left justified and at the bottom of a page. Footnotes must  be used 
sparingly and must add value to the table, figure, or data listing.  
 
Tables  
• Formal organization of tabulations may be changed during programming , if appropriate, 
e.g., tables for the different variables may be combined into a single table, or tables with 
more than  1 variable may be split into several tables.  
• Means and medians will be presented to  1 more decimal place than the raw data. 
Standard deviations will be presented to 2 more decimal places than the raw data. 
Minimums and maximums will be reported with the same number of decimal places as 
the raw data.  
• Percentages will be presented to the tenths place.  
• For frequency counts of categorical variables, categories whose count s are zero will be 
displayed for the sake of completeness. For example, if none of the subject s discontinue 
due to “lost to follow -up,” this reason will be included in the table with a count of 0. 
Categories with zero counts will not have zero percentages displayed.  
• Lower and upper confidence interval  values must  be presented to  1 decimal place more 
than the raw/derived data ( i.e., to the same number of decimal places as the mean).  
• Percentiles ( e.g., 25%, 75%) must  be presented to  1 decimal place more than the 
raw/derived data.  
• For all inferential analyses, P values will be rounded to 4 decimal places (or at the 
highest level of precision) with a leading zero (0.0001). P values less than 0.0001 will be 
presented as “<0.0001 .” 
• The last footnote s will be  
- “Sour ce: xxx”, where xxx indicates the source table  number (s) if applicable (in case aggregated 
results like mean or median are plotted) or the source listing(s) (in case individual responses are 
plotted) and/or source dataset (s) (e.g., AdaM).  
- “PROGRAM SOURCE: …\\xx.sas , DATA CUT OFF  DATE: DDMMMYYYY , RUN DATE: 
DDMMY Y hh:mm”.  
where extra ct date  (e.g., data cut off, database lock)  is the date stamp  of the data snapshot 
used.  
Page 106/117
Figures  
• Legends will be used for all figures with more than  1 variable or item displayed.  
Treatment group sizes (n=xx)  will be included, as appropriate.  
• Figures will be in black and white  but can be in color to add value to the clarity and 
readability of a figure. Lines must  be wide enough to see the line after being copied.  
• For box plots, the horizontal line will represe nt the median, + represents the group mean, 
the length of the box represents the interquartile range (25th-75th percentiles), and the 
whiskers will represent the minimum and maximum.  
• The last footnote s will be  
- “Source: xxx”, where xxx indicates the source listing number(s) and/or source dataset (s) (e .g., AdaM).  
- “PROGRAM SOURCE: …\\xx.sas, DATA CUT OFF  DATE: DDMMMYYYY, RUN DATE: 
DDMMYY hh:mm”.  
where extra ct date  (e.g., data cut off, database lock)  is the date stamp of the data snapshot 
used. 
 
Listings  
• Formal organization of the listing may be changed during programming , if appropriate, 
e.g., additional variables may be included, change in the column order, or the listing may 
be split into multiple parts due to space constraints.  
• If not otherwise specified, all data  listings will be sorted by sequence/ treatment, center, 
subject  number, visit, and date /time , as appropriate .  
• All date values will be presented in a SAS date ( e.g., 29AUG2001) format.  
• All observed time values will be presented using a 24 -hour clock HH:MM:SS format 
(e.g., 01:35:45 or 11:26). Seconds will only be reported if they were measured as part of 
the study.  
• The last footnote will be  
- “PROGRAM SOURCE: …\\xx.sas, DATA CUT OFF  DATE: DDMMMYYYY, RUN DATE: 
DDMMYY hh:mm”.  
where extra ct date  (e.g., data cut off, database lock)  is the date stamp of the data snapshot 
used.

Missing or incomplete dates ( i.e., AEs, concomitant medications , and start date s of current 
molluscum episode  and initial diagnosis ) 
The most conservative approach will be systematically considered. If the AE onset date is 
missing/incomplete, it is assumed to have occurred during the study treatment phase ( i.e., 
considered a TEAE) exc ept if the partial onset date or other data , such as the stop date, indicates 
differently. Similarly, a medication with partial start and stop dates could be considered as both a 
prior and concomitant treatment.  
 
The following algorithms will be applied to missing and incomplete start and stop dates:  
 
Start Dates  
• If the day portion of the start date is missing, then the start date will be estimated to be 
equal to the date of first application  of study drug, provided the start month and year are 
the same as the first application of study drug and the stop date is either after the first 
application of study drug or completely missing. Otherwise, the missing day portion will 
be estimated as “01.” 
• If both the day and month portions of the start date ar e missing, then the start date will be 
estimated to be equal to the date of first application of study drug, provided the start year 
is the same as the first application of study drug and the stop date is either after the first 
application of study drug or  completely missing. Otherwise, the event will be assumed to 
start on the first day of the given year ( e.g., ??-???-2013 is estimated as 01 -JAN-2013)  or 
the subject’s date of birth, whichever is latest . 
• If the start date is completely missing and the stop date is either after the application of 
study drug or completely missing, the start date will be estimated to be the first day of 
study drug application . Otherwise, the start date will be estimated to be the first day of 
the same year as the stop date  or the subject’s date of birth, whichever is latest . All other 
non-AE and non-concomitant medication day calculations where only partial dates are 
available will be handled as follows: the first day of the month will be used in the 
calculations if the day part  of a start date is missing while January 1 will be employed if 
both the month and day parts of a start date are missing.  
 
Stop Dates  
• If only the day of resolution is unknown, the day will be assumed to be the last day of the 
month ( e.g., ??-JAN-2013 will be treated as 31 -JAN-2013).  
• If both the day and month of resolution are unknown, the event will be assumed to have 
ceased on the last day of the year ( e.g., ??-???-2013 will be treated as 31 -DEC -2013).  
• If the stop date is completely missing and the event  is not continuing, the event will be 
assumed to be after first application of study drug and will be imputed using the last 
known date on the study.  
 
For the start date s of current molluscum episode  and initial diagnosis , the day will be estimated 
as “01” if only day is missing. If both month and day are missing, then it will be estimated as 
“01-JUN-YYYY” or the subject’s date of birth, whichever is latest.  
Page 108/117
 
If the start date of current molluscum episode is partial, then the following impu tation will be 
made:  
• If only the day is unknown, the day will be assumed to be the first day of the month or 
the date of birth, whichever is later.  
• If the day and month are missing, then the start date will be estimated to be June 1st or the 
date of birth, whichever is later.  
 
Standard Calculations  
Variables requiring calculation will be derived using the following formulas:  
• Days  – A duration expressed in days between  1 date (date1) and another later date (date2) is 
calculated using th e formulas noted below:  
Duration in days = date2 – date1 + 1 . 
• Months – A duration expressed in months will be  calculated as (later date – earlier date + 
1)/(30.4167) . 
• Years – A duration expressed in years will be calculated as (later date – earlier date + 
1)/(365). 
• Change from Baseline – Change from Baseline will be calculated as  follows : 
Change  from Baseline  = postbaseline value – baseline value . 
• Percent change from Baseline – Change from Baseline will be calculated as  follows : 
Percent change from Baseline = (postbaseline value – baseline value )/baseline value  
× 100.

Appendix C: SAS Programming QC Requirements  
Derived datasets are independently programmed by two programmer s. The separate datasets 
produced by the 2 programmers  must match 100%. Detailed specifications for the derived 
datasets are documented in the study analysis dataset specifications provided to the client at 
study conclusion.  
Tables are independently reprogrammed by a second programmer for numeric results.   
Listings are checked for consistency against corresponding tables, figures, and derived datasets.  
Figures are checked for consistency against corresponding tables and listings, or independently 
reprogrammed if there are no corresponding tables or  listings.  
The entire set of TLFs is checked for completeness and consistency prior to its delivery to the 
client by the lead biostatistician and a senior level, or above, reviewer .

Appendix D:  List of Tables , Figures , and Listings  
The following proposal for section 14 and 16.2  is completed according to ICH E3 guidelines.  The ICH heading number s and description are in bold . 
Minor changes from this planned index do not need to be amended in the SAP.   
 
Formal organization of tabulation s may be changed during programming , if appropriate, e.g., tables for the different variables may be combined into 
a single table, or tables with more than  1 variable may be split into several tables.

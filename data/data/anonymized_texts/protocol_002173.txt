 Multiparameter Monitor Non-Invasive Blood Pressure Validation Study 
PR2019-329  
Synopsis 
 
Purpose/ Objectives of the Clinical Investigation Plan 
The purpose of this study is to provide supporti ng documentation for accuracy claims for the Vital 
Detect blood pressure monitor on the intended adult population. A modified same arm sequential 
method with dual observer auscultati on will be used to collect data.   
The procedure, data collection methods and data analysi s that are outlined in this protocol follow  
 International Standard ISO 81060-2:2018  Non-invasive sphygmomanometers — Part 2: 
Clinical investigation of automated measurement type 
 
The end goal is to provide Non-invasive Blood Pressu re (NIBP) accuracy data to support validation of 
the Vital Detect blood pressure monitor. 
Background 
Automated blood pressure cuff measurement is the standard in numerous medical settings today. 
Oscillometric devices using deflation algorithms es timate the amplitude of pressure changes as the 
cuff deflates from above the systolic pressure. The amplitude suddenly increases as the pulse breaks 
through the occlusion of the artery. As the cuff pre ssure decreases further, the pulsations increase in 
amplitude, reaching a maximum level (which approx imates the mean pressure), and then diminishes. 
Studies show that, especially in critical cases (a rrhythmia, vasoconstriction, hypertension, shock), 
oscillometric devices are more accurate and consistent than devices using other non-invasive 
measuring techniques.  
 
This study is designed to assess the accuracy of the Vital Detect blood pressure monitor with an adult 
population using a modified same arm sequential dual observer auscultation method and is 
considered investigationa l for this evaluation.  
 Summary Overview  
The Vital Detect blood pressure monitor will be evaluated in two phases, Phase 1 and Phase 2. Phase 1 will consist of 30 subjects that will approxim ate the distribution of blood pressures as outlined 
in ISO 81060-2:2018. Upon completion of Phase 1, an interi m analysis will be performed to determine 
whether or not to proceed with Phase 2. Phase 2 will test a minimum of 55 additional subjects to 
achieve a minimum of 85 subjects. The maximum number of subjects enrolled will not exceed 150 
subjects. 
 
Two trained observers, typically a Registered Nurs e (RN) or Licensed Practical Nurse (LPN), will 
observe (listen to) the Korotkoff sounds at the br achial artery of the arm. The reference blood 
pressure measuremen ts by the nurses will be performed sequentially with t he device under test. The 
nurses will complete 1 or 2 initial baseline auscu ltatory reference blood pr essure measurements and 
device under test measurements. This is followed by 3 to 8 valid paired blood pressure readings of 
auscultatory reference blood pressure measur ements alternated with device under test 
measurements. For accuracy claims, the test dev ice measurements will be compared to those made 
by the reference device. The data for the final analysis will contain no fewer than 85 subjects with a 
minimum of 255 valid paired obser vations. At least 90% of the subjects will contribute 3 paired 
observations. In this case, additional subjects shall be used to complete the minimum number of 
paired observations. 
   
Subject Inclusion to the study:  
 Subjects must be able to provide an info rmed consent or have legally authorized 
representative consent to participate.

 Risks and benefits of the Investigational device and clinical investigation 
Currently the FDA defines blood pressure devices as Class II devices CFR Section: 21 CFR 
§870.1130, Noninvasive Blood Pressure Measuremen t System.  – Cardiovascular Diagnostic 
Devices. The devices under test in this study are thereby considered non-significant risk 
devices.  
 
The device and use of the device under test does not meet the definition of significant risk device 
under 21 CFR 812.3(m)  
 For the purpose of this study: 
It is not intended as an implant. 
o The cuff is applied to the bicep and is removed following data collection, typically less 
than 1 hour  
It is not purported or represented to be for use in supporting or sustaining human life  
o These devices are not used to support or sustain human life.  
It is not used for use of substantial importance in diag nosing, curing, mitigating, or treating disease, or 
otherwise preventing impairment of human health 
 
o They are not used to diagnose, cure mitigate or treat disease.  
The device as used in this investigation does not present a serious risk to the health, safety, or 
welfare of a subject.  
o See below for discussion of risk associat ed with the device and use of the device. 
 There are no anticipated risks or adverse device effects to be assessed. There are no contraindications for use in the proposed st udy / study population (See description of Study 
Population below). There may be othe r risks to the subject associated with the device or procedure 
that are unforeseeable at this time.  
 
Blood Pressure Cuff 
 The reported risks associated with NIBP include: A) slight discomfort upon inflation of the cuff; B) 
possible bruising; C) petechial rash; and D) disco loration of the skin beneath the cuff. In rare 
instances the reported risks associated with NIBP incl ude: A) peripheral nerve injuries; B) skin tear; 
and C) compartment syndrome (swelling of muscles in the limb causing the reduction of the blood 
supply to the muscle).  
More than 3,946 adults, children, and newborn babies have had their blood pressures taken 
repeatedly in 104 studies using similar equipment.  In these previous studies, the complications of taking repeated blood pressures were temporary a nd involved either bruising/rash; for example, 
petechiae rash (less than 2.2%), skin redness/lines (0.8%), or ti ngling/discoloration in the extremity 
wearing the cuff while the cuff is inflated (0.1%).
1,2,3,4,5,6 
 
It is possible that the test subject may experience an  allergic reaction to the material in the cuff. The 
Vital USA finger cuff in th is trial utilize standard material that has undergone skin sensitivity testing.   
 ECG Electrodes 
Materials (such as the adhesives and/or gel contact) used in the electrodes may cause some skin 
irritation in some subjects.  Typical skin irritation s present with redness of skin and in some cases of 
sensitivity is an allergic reacti on.  Biocompatibility testing for su rface contact electrodes is a 
requirement of the international Standards Organization (ISO) 10993- Biological Evaluation of Medical Devices.  The risk in the use of ECG electrodes is believed to be minimal. 
  
 
Pulse Oximetry Sensor 
Pulse Oximetry Sensor placement involves positioning pulse oximetry sensors on the volunteer 
subject in the same manner that is used on hospital ized patients.  The sensors may be warm to the 
touch. Under normal operating conditions, (no faul t conditions), the sensors are not expected to

 overheat. If the sensors are too wa rm, they will be removed immediat ely.  Clip on sensors exert a 
minimal amount of pressure. They should not caus e discomfort. If the sensor s are too uncomfortable, 
they will be removed immediately.  Adhesive sensors or tape may cause some irritations to the skin in 
some subjects. Every effort will be made to minimize  products with natural rubber or late x. Products 
containing natural rubber or latex will be identified.  The risk in the use of pulse oximetry sensors is 
believed to be minimal. 
 
General Electrical Equipment 
Electrical hazards are a potential risk with all electrical equipment.  The equipment used in this study has been designed to meet applicable safety standards.  The equipment will be safety and 
functionally tested by the sponsor and instit ution (as indicated) prior to patient use. T he possibility of 
any electrical hazard is extremely remote.    
Benefits 
The benefits to the study are to the advancement of non-invasive medical monitoring of patients by 
improving Accuracy and performance of non-invasive blood pressure measurements. The only 
alternative to this study is to NOT participate.  
 
Design of the Clinical Investigation 
Method   
The Vital Detect blood pressure monitor will be evaluated as a comparat ive, single center, non-
randomized, study in a minimum of 30 subjects, conducted in 2 phases. The maximum number of 
subjects enrolled is 150 for both phases, to achieve 85 valid data sets. Each subject test is expected 
to take up to 1 hour. The overall data collection proc ess is expected to be completed across 6 weeks. 
 The Auscultator will have a normal audiogram before the study begins. All experimenters will review 
the protocol prior to test. 
 Each subject or his/her legally authorized repr esentative will be provided an IRB approved Informed 
Consent. As applicable, subjects will be told about any new information that might change their decision to participate. Subjects who have completed the informed consent and health questionnaire 
form and meet inclusion/exclusion criteria will be enrolled in the study if they meet desired blood 
pressure demographics. The study will be explained within his/her ability to understand.  
Phase 1 will enroll a minimum of 30 qualified subjects  into the study. Two tr ained observers will listen 
to the Korotkoff sounds at the brachial artery of the arm. The reference blood pressure 
measurements by the observers will be performed se quentially with the device under test. The device 
under test memory will be cleared prior to the nex t determination. In some cases, this may mean 
powering down the device to clear the previous readings. The observers will complete 1 or 2 initial 
baseline blood pressure measurements and then 3 to  8 paired NIBP measurements to be collected 
for the Accuracy evaluation will follow. Any pair of observers’ determinations wi th a difference greater 
than 4 mmHg shall be excluded. If any determinations are excluded, additional pair(s) of determinations shall be taken to ensure that  the needed number of valid test-reference  pairs is 
collected (up to a maximum of 8 paired readings). In  some cases, it may be that only 2 valid paired 
readings are achieved. This protocol allows for up to 10% of the subjects to have 2 valid paired 
observations (90% or more will contribute 3 paired ob servations). In this case, additional subjects 
shall be used to complete the minimum number of paired observations.  A minimum of 85 valid paired NIBP measurements is needed for the final Accura cy analysis. The blood pressure measurements 
will be such that reference cuff measurements will be alternated with the device under test 
measurement. The auscultator will wait a mini mum of 60 seconds between each blood pressure 
determination. Each observer’s recording of obser vations of the reference sphygmomanometer shall 
not be visible to the other observer.  The observers will record the exact measurement heard during 
auscultation and will not round the blood pressure readings.  The readings of the sphygmomanometer-under-test shall not be visible to ei ther of these observers.  Each subject test is 
expected to take up to 60 minutes for the enrollment / data collection process.

After data collection has taken place on a minimu m of 30 subjects, an interim analysis will be 
performed. At this point Vital USA will have the option to continue wi th Phase 2 of the study, as long 
as no changes were made to the device. Phase 2 will be conducted in the same manner as Phase 1 (as outlined above), enrolling a minimum of 55 additional  subjects for a total of at least 85 subjects. 
 
There are no deviations expected from this in vestigation plan, should deviations be needed, 
discussions will be conducted with the sponsoring co mpany, Principal investigator and the IRB will be 
notified per their requirements. Deviations from the study protocol will be disclosed in the final report.  
 
Endpoint / Comparator 
The primary objective of this study is to provide a validation to ISO 81060-2:2018 for non-invasive

15. Make sure the previous reading of the device- under-test is cleared prior to the next reading. 
16. For each subsequent blood pressure determination, wait at least 60 seconds between the 
readings.  
17. The observers will start with the refe rence sphygmomanometer, then device-under-test, 
alternating until three valid paired blood pressure  determinations are completed. The final reading 
should be on the reference sphygmomanometer. Make sure to wait at least 60 seconds between 
each of the readings. 
18. The reference blood pressure determinations prior to the test device and post the test device will 
be averaged for the actual reference blood pressure determination of comparison. 
19. Record each blood pressure determination and the pulse rate on the Case Report Form. 
20. A maximum number of attempts for the subject is 8 paired determinations. 
21. After three valid test-reference pair s are completed, the cuff will be removed. 
22. The auscultator will monitor the subject’s co mfort level and the cuff test site throughout the 
duration of the stud y and upon removal of the cuff.     
23. The subject will be advised during the study that he/she may stop the test at any time. 
24. All equipment will be removed from the subject. 25. The observers w ill record any final notes on the Case Report Form. The subject will be released 
with no follow-up required. 
 
 
Statistical Considerations 
There will be an interim statistical analysis following th e data collection of the first 30 subjects. The final 
analysis for the Vital Detect blood pressure monitor will contain no fewer than 85 subjects resulting in a 
minimum of 255 paired observations .  
 All data from a subject shall be excluded if any two reference systolic blood pressure determinations differ 
by more than 12 mmHg or if any two reference diasto lic blood pressure determinations differ by more 
than 8 mmHg. If an individual subject is unstable du ring the period of the test, two valid consecutive 
determination pairs may be used. No more that 10% i ndividual subjects may have fewer than three valid

Withdrawal, Early Termination or Suspension of the Investigation 
Consideration for early termination or suspensi on of the investigation is tied to unanticipated 
equipment failure or a decision by Vital  USA or Clinimark based on business reasons.   
Participation in the study is voluntary. Subjects may choose to withdraw from the study at any point. If 
a subject officially withdraws from the study, the laboratory staff w ill document the reason for 
withdrawal in the CRF.   Participation in the study may also be stopped at any time by the principal investigator or by the Sub-
investigators or sponsor. 
 The subject’s failure to cooperate fully (as determined by the investigator in his or her sole 
discretion) with the required conduct of this study. 
 The subject’s development of an illness as determi ned by the investigator in his or her sole 
discretion. 
 A determination by a Clinimark representative (in his or her sole discretion), for whatever cause, 
that the study should be discontinued. 
 A determination by the sponsor (in his or her sole  discretion), for whatever cause, that the study 
should be discontinued 
 
The collection of data for study subjec ts will cease in the following cases:  
 Subject completes all study requirements 
 Subject withdraws consent 
 Investigator’s decision that it is in subjec t’s best interest to be discontinued from the study 
 Subject death  
 Adverse event other than death requiring wi thdrawal of the subject from the study 
 Determination that the subject was ineligible for the study.  
 
There will not be any follow-up procedures for withdr awn or discontinued subjects required, unless a 
follow-up is required at the Investigator’s discretion.

Consideration for early termination or suspensi on of the investigation is tied to unanticipated 
equipment failure or a decision by the sponsor or the site. Both Sponsor and Clinimark reserve the 
right to discontinue the study at any time for administrative or other reasons. Written notice of study termination will be submitted to the investigator in advance of such terminatio n. Termination of a 
specific site can occur because of, but not limited to, inadequate data collection, low subject 
enrollment, or non-compliance with the prot ocol or other research requirements. 
 
Early termination results when the study is  closed prior to the end of the study. A study suspension is  
a temporary postponement of the study activities related to enrollment. Both are possible for the 
study. If the study is terminated or suspended,  no additional enrollment will be allowed unless 
otherwise informed by the sponsor. The current s ubjects will be followed according to the protocol. 
 
If the study is terminated prematurely or sus pended by the sponsor/investigator, the sponsor 
/investigator will promptly inform the regulatory authorities (if requ ired) of the termination and the 
reason(s). IRB/IECs will also be pr omptly informed and provided with the reason(s) for termination or 
suspension by the sponsor/ investigator. The in vestigator will promptly info rm the subjects and assure 
appropriate follow-up for the subject.  
If the investigator (or IRB/IEC) te rminates or suspends the investigation the inve stigator will promptly 
inform the institution (if required) and the IRB/IE C, and provide a detailed written explanation of the 
termination or suspension. The investigator will pr omptly inform the subjects and assure appropriate 
therapy and follow-up for the subjects. The sponsor w ill inform the regulatory authorities (if required). 
 
Withdrawal of IRB approval shall be reported to the sponsor by the inve stigator within 5 working days. 
In case of early termination of the study, all study subjects should be followed until the resolution of 
any pending adverse event(s).  
Publication Policy 
The results of this investigation will not be submitted for publication.

 SYNOPSIS 
 
This randomized, controlled, double-masked (subject and observer) clinical trial 
intends to randomize approximately 558 ma le and female subjects over 18 years 
old who have been diagnosed with op en-angle glaucoma (OAG) or ocular 
hypertension (OHT).  All subjects are require d to meet eligibility criteria at Visit 
1 (Screening) and unmedicated IOP inclusi on criteria at Visit 2 (Baseline).  The 
purpose of this study is to evaluate th e IOP-lowering effect of each of two 
investigational implanted medication treatm ents, as compared to a control topical 
medication treatment.  After completing Visit 2 (Baseline), subjects will be 
randomized in a 1:1:1 allocation to one of three study treatment arms:  model  
G2TR-  implant (test) arm, model G2TR -  implant (test) arm, and topical 
timolol (control) arm.  Postoperatively, there are 16 follow-up visits over a three-year period.  Specular microscopy photos  will be collected at selected sites.

 1 INTRODUCTION 
Glaucoma is a group of eye diseases ch aracterized by progressive, irreversible 
and largely asymptomatic vision loss caused by optic nerve damage, which is 
most commonly associated with elevat ed levels of intr aocular pressure. 
Glaucoma is a chronic condition that progresses slowly over long periods of 
time and can have a devastating impact  on a patient's vision and quality of 
life.  Reducing intraocular pressure cu rrently is the only proven treatment for 
glaucoma.  
Treatment for open-angle glaucoma ( OAG) traditionally has started with 
topical ocular hypotensive medical ther apy.  Development of more effective 
medications has increased the popularity of  this approach as  initial treatment 
compared to more invasive inci sional or drainage  device surgery. 
Furthermore, the more benign medicati on treatments preserve the ocular 
tissues in the event that more invasive  surgical approach es are eventually 
required. The various topical ocular medicatio ns available to reduce IOP include 
miotics, β-adrenergic receptor antagonists ( β-blockers), car bonic anhydrase 
inhibitors (CAIs), α-adrenergic receptor agonists ( α-agonists), and 
prostaglandin analogues (PGAs).  The P GAs are a class of ocular hypotensive 
agents that have been proven effectiv e in lowering IOP in subjects with OAG 
or OHT.  Other advantages of this cla ss of medications is that the systemic 
side effects associated with α -agonists (e.g., dry mouth, drowsiness) 
and  β - blockers (e.g., depression, fatigue, br adycardia) do not appear to be 
associated with PGAs.  Furthermore,  the ocular side effects typically 
associated with a-agonists (e.g., allergic  reactions), and c holinergic agents 
(e.g., reduced vision), do not seem to  manifest with the use of PGAs. 
However, PGAs have been shown to be associated with side  effects such as 
ocular hyperemia, iris hyperchromia, periorbital atrophy, increased eyelash 
growth, general ocular surface discomfort and headache.
1-5 These side effects 
and other factors including cost, compliance, and the difficulty of proper 
instillation, can sometimes hinder the proper use of topical medications.6,7 
Some patients may possess or develop an intolerance to topical medications or 
the preservatives in their formulations. 
The Travoprost Intraocular Implant was developed to remove or minimize the 
issue of patient compliance with topical  hypotensive medication.  This clinical 
protocol will evaluate tw o versions of the Travopro st Intraocular Implant:  
Model G2TR-  and Model G2TR .  Th e implants are identical except 
that they are designed to elute travoprost at two di fferent elution rates.

 CONFIDENTIAL   page 12 of 72 
 For the purposes of this protocol, M odel G2TR-  is the high elution rate 
implant and Model G2TR-  is th e low elution rate implant.  
These implants have the potential for pr oviding important benefits to patients. 
The long duration of drug therapy pr ovided by the implants avoids the 
problem of compliance with topical ocular hypotensive medications.  
 
  
Earlier versions of both models of th e implant have been investigated in 
clinical trials conducted in  (Pha se 1/2) as well as the United States 
(Phase 2).  The results from the U.S. Ph ase 2 trial have demonstrated that the 
Model G2TR-  and G2TR-  implants have long-term IOP-lowering 
effects and are also generally well-tolerated by study subjec ts.  These results 
support the continued evaluation of the im plant models in a Phase 3 trial.   
2 OBJECTIVE 
The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of intraocular implants that elute travoprost at two di fferent elution rates.  Specifically, the 
Travoprost Intraocular Implant Model G2TR- (high elution rate) and the 
Travoprost Intraocular Implant Model G2 TR- (low elution rate).  Both 
implants will be compared to Timolol Maleate Ophthalmic Solution, USP, 
0.5% (timolol) for reducing intraocular pr essure in subjects with open-angle 
glaucoma (OAG) or ocular hypertension (OHT). 
3 CLINICAL HYPOTHESIS 
The following are the hypotheses for the study: 
‐ Intraocular implants containing travoprost are at least as effective as 
timolol in achieving lowered intraocu lar pressure (IOP) in subjects with 
OAG or OHT. 
‐ Intraocular implants containing travoprost are well-tolerated. 
4 STUDY DESIGN 
This is a prospective, randomized, doubl e-masked, active-controlled, parallel-
group, multi-center clinical trial compar ing the efficacy and safety of the 
Model G2TR  Travoprost Intraocula r Implant and the Model G2TR-  
Travoprost Intraocular Impl ant to topical timolol in subjects with OAG or 
OHT.  Approximately 558 subjects will be  randomized in this study and will 
be followed through 3 years postoperative.

 7.2.3 CRITERIA FOR EARLY STUDY EXIT  
Subjects may voluntarily withdraw fr om the study at any time.  The 
investigator may elect to  discontinue any subject for reasons unrelated to 
the study product.  Details of a subj ect’s exit from the study should be 
recorded in the subject’s clinical reco rds.  Subjects exited after signing the 
informed consent form and prior to study completion will be handled as 
follows: 
 
7.2.3.1 Prior to Randomization 
Subjects will be ineligible for the study if they fail to meet Visit 1 
(Screening) criteria, baseline criter ia or randomization criteria as 
outlined in Section 7.2, if they withdraw consent, or if study 
randomization goals have been met. 
 
7.2.3.2 After Randomization 
Subjects may be exited (discontinued) from the study in the event of a 
condition that may cause them harm  if participation were to be 
continued.  Subjects may al so withdraw voluntarily. 
 
7.2.3.3 Lost to Follow-up 
Subjects who miss postoperative stu dy visits and cannot be contacted 
within a reasonable timeframe via letter or telephone, will be 
considered lost to follow-up.  The site will make at least three attempts 
to contact the subject via telephone.  If unsuccessful, the site will send 
a registered letter with return recei pt to the subject.  The letter will 
request the subject to cont act and return to the st udy site.  If the subject 
does not contact the site within a week after the letter was received, 
he/she will be considered lost to follow-up, and the site will send a 
second registered letter (with return  receipt) to notify the subject of 
study exit due to lack of respons e to the telephone calls and first 
registered letter.  A Study Exit CRF may then be completed for the 
subject.  
All attempts to contact the subj ect (including telephone call logs, 
copies of registered letters and re gistered letter receipts) must be 
documented and maintained with the subject’s study source 
documentation.

 9.2 Analysis Populations 
9.2.1 SAFETY POPULATION (SP) 
The safety analysis population will c ontain all subjects who are randomized 
and receive any level of treatment.  Subjects will be grouped according to 
their actual treatment received, not  according to their randomization 
assignment (as randomized). 
9.2.2 INTENT-TO-TREAT (ITT) POPULATION  
This subset includes all subjects who are randomized.  All baseline 
characteristics will be summarized based on ITT.  Subjects in the ITT will be 
analyzed according to original trea tment assignment, regardless of actual 
treatment received.  The primary analyses will be based on this ITT 
population. 
9.2.3 PER-PROTOCOL (PP) POPULATION  
The Per Protocol Population is a subset  of ITT.  It includes all the ITT 
subjects who received the treatment and medication drops based on the

to impact the primary efficacy endpoints.  
 
 
9.3 General Statistical Methods 
9.4 Safety Analyses 
No formal statistical testing will be conducted for the safety analyses.  No 
imputation will be performed for the mi ssing values.  All summaries will be 
based on the available data of the safety population.   
Descriptive statistics will be  calculated as described in Section 9.3  at each 
visit for the 3 treatment groups separatel y.  For each reported  adverse event in 
each treatment group, the percentage of eyes will be reported.  The sections 
below describe specific data handling fo r adverse events, and best spectacle 
corrected visual acuity (BSCVA). Other safety outcomes such as slit la mp examination, intraocular pressure, 
dilated fundus examination, and endot helial cell count (from specular 
microscopy at selected sites) will be su mmarized descriptively at each visit for 
the Safety Population.  Line listings for abnormal findings for individual eyes

No interim analyses are planned. 
10 ADVERSE EVENTS   
An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as  any untoward and unintended medical 
occurrence (e.g., sign, symptom, disease, syndrome, intercurrent illness) that occurs in a study subject, regardless of  the suspected cause during the study. 
Adverse events will be clearly documented on the study source document and monitored throughout the course of the study.   
Events occurring after signing the informed  consent but prior to the implant or 
sham procedure should be documented in the medical history.  Events

 observed during or after the implant or sham procedure until the final study 
visit, are to be recorded as AEs.  
Any clinically significant change in a s ubject's condition afte r receiving any of 
the study treatments, regardless of causal ity, is to be cons idered an adverse 
event, unless the change is determined to be a continuation of a pre-existing 
condition that is documented in the subj ect's medical history.  If an adverse 
event occurs, an AE form must be completed.   
An AE includes any of the following: 
 An exacerbation or an unexpected incr ease in frequency or intensity of a 
pre-existing condition, including inte rmittent or episodic conditions 
 New conditions or illnesses detected or diagnosed after the implant or 
sham procedure 
 A suspected interaction with any of the study treatments 
 Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequel ae of a suspected overdose of either 
any of the study treatments or a concomitant medication 
 Any clinically significant laboratory finding that was not present prior to 
receiving any of th e study treatments 
An AE does NOT include any of the following: 
 Anticipated day-to-day fluctuati ons of any pre-existing conditions, 
including the disease un der study (OAG and OHT). 
 Medical or surgical procedure, (e.g., co lonoscopy or hernia repair).  The 
condition that led to the procedure may be an AE, if not present in medical 
history. 
 Hospitalizations where an untoward medical occurrence did not occur 
(social or convenience ad mission to the hospital). 
 Pre-existing conditions or diseases that were pres ent before receiving any 
of the study treatments that do not wors en or that are ch ronic but stable 
 Changes in a chronic condition or diseas e that are consistent with natural 
disease progression.  (These medical  conditions should be adequately 
documented).   
 Lack of efficacy of the study treatment for the condition being 
investigated.

 AEs will be graded on a 3-point scale a nd reported in detail as indicated on 
the CRF: 
Mild: easily tolerated, causing minimal discomfort and not 
interfering with normal everyday activities 
Moderate: sufficiently discomforting to interfere with normal 
everyday activities 
Severe:  incapacitating and/or preventing normal everyday activities 
 
The relationship of each AE to study tr eatment should be determined by the 
investigator using the following explanations: 
 
Definitely Unrelated: the event is clearl y related to other factors such as the 
subject’s clinical state, therapeutic interventions, or concomitant medications administered to the subject  
Unlikely Related: the event is most lik ely produced by other factors such as 
the subject’s clinical state, therapeutic interventions, or 
concomitant medications administered to the subject; and does not follow a known res ponse pattern to the study 
medication  
Possibly Related: the event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from 
the time of drug administration; and/or follows a known response pattern to the study medication; but could have 
been produced by other factors such as the subject’s clinical state, therapeutic interventions, or concomitant medications administered to the subject  
Probably Related: the event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from 
the time of drug administration; and/or follows a known response pattern to the study me dication; and is not likely 
to have been produced by other factors such as the subject’s clinical state, therapeutic interventions, or concomitant medications administered to the subject  
Definitely Related: the event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from

 10.1 Serious Adverse Event 
Serious adverse events are defined as any findings that s uggest a significant 
hazard, contraindication, side effect, or precaution.  Any adverse event is 
considered a serious adverse event if  it results in any of the following 
outcomes: 
‐ Death 
‐ Life- or sight-threatening 
‐ Required admission to the hospital or prolongation of an existing 
hospitalization (emergency room vis its that do not result in admission 
to the hospital should be evaluate d for one of the other serious 
outcomes) 
‐ A persistent or signifi cant disability/incapacity 
‐ A congenital anomaly/birth defect 
 
The terms “mild,” “moderate,” and “severe” are measures of intensity; thus a severe AE is not necessarily serious.  For example, nausea of several hours 
duration may be rated as severe, but may not be clinically serious.  Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or 
require admission to the hospital may be  considered a serious adverse drug 
experience when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to 
prevent one of the outcome s listed above.  A life-th reatening event is any 
event that places the subject at substantia l risk of death from the event as it 
occurred; it does not refer to an even t that hypothetically might have caused 
death if it were more severe.  A si ght-threatening event is any event that 
places the subject at risk of permanently losing vision in either eye as a direct result of the event. 
 
Serious adverse events must be report ed to Glaukos immediately (preferably 
within 24 hours of knowledge of the event). 
Email:   
When new significant information (including the outcome of the event) is obtained, the investigator should info rm
 Glaukos as soon as possible.  
Depending on the nature of the AE, Gl aukos may request copies of the 
ophthalmic and medical records of the subject.  If the subject was hospitalized for a study-treatment related serious adverse event, a copy of the discharge summary must be forwarded to Glaukos as soon as possible. 
 
10.2 Unexpected Adverse Event 
An adverse event is considered “unexp ected” if it is not listed in the 
investigator brochure or is not  listed at the specificity or severity that has been 

CLINICAL PROTOCOL

 observed, or is not consistent with th e risk information described in the 
general investigational plan or protocol.   
Unexpected adverse events must be  reported to Glaukos immediately 
(preferably within 24 hours of  knowledge of the event).   
 Email: i  
When new significant information (including the outcome of the event) is 
obtained, the investigator should info rm Glaukos as soon as possible.  
Depending on the nature of the AE, Gl aukos may request copies of the 
ophthalmic and medical records of the subject.  If the subject was hospitalized for a study-treatment related unexpected adverse event, a copy of the discharge summary must be forwarde d to Glaukos as soon as possible. 
 
10.3 Suspected, Unexpected, Serious, Adverse Event (SUSAR) 
A Suspected Unexpected Serious Adve rse Reaction (SUSAR) is any AE for 
which there is evidence to suggest  a causal relationship between the 
Travoprost Intraocular Implant and the AE, and which is assessed as both 
unexpected and serious.  An unexpected  adverse reaction, i.e. any untoward 
and unintended response to any of the study treatments, is one for which the 
nature and severity is inconsistent with the applicable reference safety 
information (e.g., Invest igator’s Brochure).  
 
10.4 Adverse Events Follow-up 
Adverse events will be followed and documented until the time of complete resolution, or resolution with sequelae, or exit from the study with an assessment of the outcome.  
 
11 MAINTAINING THE MASK 
This will be a masked study, in which the treatments will be unknown to the 
subject and the site staff performing cer tain measurements.  All surgical study 
kits will be packaged in boxes labeled with the study number and unique kit 
number.  All medication st udy kits will be packaged in boxes labeled with the 
study number and unique kit number.  Th e study medications dispensed at a 
given site will be contained in bottles th at are similar in size and cap color and 
packaged in identical study kit boxes.  Both the bottles and the kit boxes will 
be labeled with the study number and unique kit number and dosing instructions.

Ethical principles for medical re search involving human subjects 
 
Adopted by the 18th WMA General Asse mbly, Helsinki, Finland, June 1964 
and amended by the: 
29th WMA General Assembly, Tokyo, Japan, October 1975 
35th WMA General Assembly, Venice, Italy, October 1983

Preamble 
1.         The World Medical Associat ion (WMA) has developed the Declaration of 
Helsinki as a statement of ethical prin ciples for medical research involving 
human subjects, including research on  identifiable human material and 
data. 
The Declaration is intended to be  read as a whole and each of its 
constituent paragraphs should be app lied with consideration of all other 
relevant paragraphs. 
 
2.         Consistent with the mandate  of the WMA, the Declaration is addressed 
primarily to physicians.  The WMA enc ourages others who are involved in 
medical research involving human s ubjects to adopt these principles. 
 General Principles 3.         The Declaration of Geneva of the WMA binds the physician with the 
words, “The health of my patient will be my first consideration,” and the International Code of Medical Ethics declares that, “A physician shall act 
in the patient’s best interest when providing medical care.” 
 4.         It is the duty of the physic ian to promote and safeguard the health, well-
being and rights of patients, including  those who are involved in medical

 research. The physician’s knowledge and conscience are dedicated to the 
fulfilment of this duty. 
 
5.         Medical progress is based on re search that ultimately must include studies 
involving human subjects. 
 
6.         The primary purpose of medical  research involving hu man subjects is to 
understand the causes, development and effects of diseases and improve 
preventive, diagnostic and therapeuti c interventions (methods, procedures 
and treatments).  Even the best prov en interventions must be evaluated 
continually through research for their safety, effectiveness, efficiency, 
accessibility and quality. 
 7.         Medical research is subject to ethical standards th at promote and ensure 
respect for all human subjects and protect their health and rights. 
 
8.         While the primary purpose of  medical research is to generate new 
knowledge, this goal can never take precedence over the rights and 
interests of individual research subjects. 
 
9.         It is the duty of physicians w ho are involved in medical research to protect 
the life, health, dignity, integrity, ri ght to self-determination, privacy, and 
confidentiality of personal inform ation of research subjects.  The 
responsibility for the protect ion of research subjects must always rest with 
the physician or other health care professionals and never with the research subjects, even though they have given consent. 
 10.       Physicians must consider th e ethical, legal and regulatory norms and 
standards for research in volving human subjects in their own countries as 
well as applicable international norms  and standards.  No national or 
international ethical, legal or regu latory requirement should reduce or 
eliminate any of the protections for research subjects set forth in this Declaration. 
 
11.       Medical research should be co nducted in a manner that minimises possible 
harm to the environment. 
 
12.       Medical research involving human subjects must be conducted only by 
individuals with the appropriate ethi cs and scientific education, training 
and qualifications.  Research on patien ts or healthy volunteers requires the 
supervision of a competent and appropr iately qualified physician or other 
health care professional.

13.       Groups that are underrepresente d in medical research should be provided 
appropriate access to participation in research. 
 14.       Physicians who combine medi cal research with medical care should 
involve their patients in re search only to the extent that this is justified by 
its potential preventive, diagnostic or therapeutic value and if the 
physician has good reason to believe th at participation in the research 
study will not adversely affect the he alth of the patients who serve as 
research subjects. 
 15.       Appropriate compensation and treatment for subjects who are harmed as a 
result of participating in research must be ensured. 
 Risks, Burdens and Benefits 16.       In medical practice and in me dical research, most interventions involve 
risks and burdens. 
Medical research involving human subj ects may only be conducted if the 
importance of the objective outweighs  the risks and burdens to the 
research subjects. 
 
17.       All medical research invo lving human subjects must be preceded by 
careful assessment of predictable risk s and burdens to the individuals and 
groups involved in the research in comp arison with foreseeable benefits to 
them and to other individuals or groups affected by the condition under investigation. 
Measures to minimise the risks must be implemented.  The risks must be 
continuously monitored, assessed and documented by the researcher. 
 
18.       Physicians may not be invo lved in a research study involving human 
subjects unless they are confident th at the risks have been adequately 
assessed and can be satisfactorily managed. 
When the risks are found to outweigh th e potential benefits or when there 
is conclusive proof of definitive out comes, physicians must assess whether 
to continue, modify or immediately stop the study.

 Vulnerable Groups and Individuals 
19.       Some groups and individuals are particularly vulnerable and may have an 
increased likelihood of being wronged or of incurring additional harm. 
All vulnerable groups and individu als should receive specifically 
considered protection. 
 
20.       Medical research with a vulnerabl e group is only justified if the research is 
responsive to the health needs or prio rities of this group and the research 
cannot be carried out in a non-vulne rable group.  In addition, this group 
should stand to benefit from the knowledge, practices or interventions that result from the research. 
 Scientific Requirements and Research Protocols 
21.       Medical research involving human subjects must conform to generally 
accepted scientific principles, be based on a thorough knowledge of the 
scientific literature, other relevant sources of information, and adequate 
laboratory and, as appropriate, animal  experimentation.  The welfare of 
animals used for research must be respected. 
 22.       The design and performance of each research study involving human 
subjects must be clearly described an d justified in a research protocol. 
The protocol should contain a statem ent of the ethical considerations 
involved and should indicate how the prin ciples in this Declaration have 
been addressed.  The protocol shou ld include information regarding 
funding, sponsors, institutional affiliati ons, potential conflicts of interest, 
incentives for subjects and information regarding provisions for treating and/or compensating subjects who are harmed as a consequence of participation in the research study. 
In clinical trials, the protocol must also describe appropriate arrangements 
for post-trial provisions.

 Research Ethics Committees 
23.       The research protocol must be submitted for consideration, comment, 
guidance and approval to the concerne d research ethics committee before 
the study begins.  This committee must  be transparent in its functioning, 
must be independent of the resear cher, the sponsor and any other undue 
influence and must be duly qualified.  It must take into consideration the 
laws and regulations of the country or countries in which the research is to 
be performed as well as applicable international norms and standards but 
these must not be allowed to reduce or eliminate any of the protections for research subjects set forth in this Declaration. 
The committee must have the right to monitor ongoing studies.  The 
researcher must provide monitoring information to the committee, 
especially information about any seri ous adverse events.  No amendment 
to the protocol may be made without  consideration and approval by the 
committee.  After the end of the study, the researchers must submit a final report to the committee containing a su mmary of the study’s findings and 
conclusions. 
 
Privacy and Confidentiality 
24.       Every precaution must be taken to  protect the privacy of research subjects 
and the confidentiality of their personal information. 
 Informed Consent 25.       Participation by individuals capable of giving informed consent as 
subjects in medical research mu st be voluntary.  Although it may be 
appropriate to consult family members or community leaders, no individual capable of giving inform ed consent may be enrolled in a 
research study unless he or she freely agrees. 
 
26.       In medical research involving  human subjects capable of giving informed 
consent, each potential subject must be adequately informed of the aims, 
methods, sources of funding, any po ssible conflicts of interest, 
institutional affiliations of the researcher, the anticipated benefits and 
potential risks of the study and th e discomfort it may entail, post-study 
provisions and any other relevant aspects of the study.  The potential subject must be informed of the right to refuse to participate in the study 
or to withdraw consent to participate at any time without reprisal.  Special 
attention should be given to the specific information needs of individual potential subjects as well as to the methods used to deliver the 
information.

 CONFIDENTIAL   page 70 of 72 
 After ensuring that the potential su bject has understood the information, 
the physician or another appropriately qualified individual must then seek 
the potential subject’s freely-given in formed consent, preferably in 
writing.  If the consent cannot be expressed in writing, the non-written 
consent must be formally documented and witnessed. 
All medical research subjects shoul d be given the option of being 
informed about the general outc ome and results of the study. 
 
27.       When seeking informed consent for participation in a research study the 
physician must be particularly cautiou s if the potential subject is in a 
dependent relationship with the physician  or may consent under duress.  In 
such situations the informed consen t must be sought by an appropriately 
qualified individual who is completely independent of this relationship. 
 
28.       For a potential research subj ect who is incapable of giving informed 
consent, the physician must seek informed consent from the legally authorised representative.  These in dividuals must not be included in a 
research study that has no likeli hood of benefit for them unless it is 
intended to promote the health of the group represented by the potential 
subject, the research cannot instead be performed with persons capable of providing informed consent, and the re search entails only minimal risk 
and minimal burden. 
 29.       When a potential research su bject who is deemed incapable of giving 
informed consent is able to give asse nt to decisions about participation in 
research, the physician must seek that assent in addition to the consent of 
the legally authorised representative.  The potential subject’s dissent should be respected. 
 
30.       Research involving subjects w ho are physically or mentally incapable of 
giving consent, for example, unconscious  patients, may be done only if the 
physical or mental condition that prev ents giving informed consent is a 
necessary characteristic of  the research  group.  In such circumstances the 
physician must seek informed consent from the legally authorised representative.  If no such representa tive is available and if the research 
cannot be delayed, the study may proceed without informed consent 
provided that the specific reasons fo r involving subjects with a condition 
that renders them unable to give inform ed consent have been stated in the 
research protocol and the study has b een approved by a research ethics 
committee.  Consent to remain in the research must be obtained as soon as 
possible from the subject or a le gally authorised representative.

31.       The physician must fully inform the patient which aspects of their care are 
related to the research.  The refusal of a patient to  participate in a study or 
the patient’s decision to withdraw from the stud y must never adversely 
affect the patient-physician relationship. 
 32.       For medical research using identifiable human material  or data, such as 
research on material or data containe d in biobanks or similar repositories, 
physicians must seek informed consen t for its collection, storage and/or 
reuse.  There may be exceptional situations where consent would be impossible or impracticable to obtain for such research.  In such situations the research may be done only after consideration and approval of a 
research ethics committee. 
 Use of Placebo 33.       The benefits, risks, burdens a nd effectiveness of a new intervention must 
be tested against those of the best proven intervention(s), except in the 
following circumstances: 
• Where no proven intervention exis ts, the use of placebo, or no 
intervention, is acceptable; or 
• Where for compelling and scie ntifically sound methodological 
reasons the use of any interventi on less effective than the best 
proven one, the use of placebo, or no  intervention is necessary to 
determine the efficacy or safety of an intervention 
• and the patients who receive any intervention less effective than the best proven one, placebo, or no intervention will not be subject to additional risks of serious or ir reversible harm as a result of not 
receiving the best pr oven intervention. 
Extreme care must be taken to avoid abuse of this option. 
 Post-Trial Provisions 34.       In advance of a clinical tr ial, sponsors, researchers and host country 
governments should make provisions for post-trial access for all participants who still need an interven tion identified as beneficial in the 
trial.  This information must also be  disclosed to part icipants during the 
informed consent process.

 Research Registration and Publicat ion and Dissemination of Results 
35.       Every research study involving human subjects must be registered in a 
publicly accessible database before recruitment of the first subject. 
 
36.       Researchers, authors, sponsors, editors and publishe rs all have ethical 
obligations with regard to the publication and dissemination of the results 
of research.  Researchers have a duty to make publicly available the 
results of their research on human subjects and are accountable for the 
completeness and accuracy of their repor ts.  All parties should adhere to 
accepted guidelines for ethical reporting.  Negative and inconclusive as well as positive results must be publ ished or otherwise made publicly 
available.  Sources of funding, institutional affiliations and conflicts of 
interest must be declared in the pub lication.  Reports of research not in 
accordance with the principles of th is Declaration should not be accepted 
for publication. 
 Unproven Interventions in Clinical Practice 37.       In the treatment of an indivi dual patient, where proven interventions do 
not exist or other known interventi ons have been ineffective, the 
physician, after seeking expert advice , with informed consent from the 
patient or a legally authorised representative, may use an unproven 
intervention if in the phy sician’s judgement it offe rs hope of saving life, 
re-establishing health or alleviati ng suffering.  This intervention should 
subsequently be made the object of research, designed to evaluate its 
safety and efficacy.  In all cases, new information must be recorded and, where appropriate, made publicly available.

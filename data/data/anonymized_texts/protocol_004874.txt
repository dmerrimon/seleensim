Study Description:  
This is a Phase 2, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, dose -ranging study to evaluate the 
efficacy, safety, and tolerability of SAGE -324 in participants  with ET. Participants, site staff, and 
sponsor personnel will be blinded to treatment allocat ions.  The study is presented schematically in 
Figure  1. 
Figure  1: Study Design  
 
Abbreviation: TETRAS = The Esse ntial Tremor Rating Assessment Scale . 
Note: The Screening Period may be extended for an additional 14 days  (total of 42 days) for subjects requiring 
additional time to taper ET medication (other than propranolol) , after approval from the sponsor . 
 
This study includes a Screening Period of up to 28 days, a 90 -day double -blind Treatment Period 
(90 days of dosing), and a 14 -day Follow -up Period. After providing informed consent, participants 
will undergo screening assessments to determine eligibility a s outlined in Table  2.  
• Screening Period: The Screening Period begins with the signing of the informed consent 
form (ICF). Eligible participants will visit the study center on Day 1 and complete additional 
eligibility and baseline assessments, as specified in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table  2). 
The Screening Period may be extended for an additional 14 days  (total of 42 days) for 
subjects requiring additional time to taper ET medication (other than propranolol) , after 
approval from the sponsor . Following completion of screening and Day  1 eligibility 
assessments, participants will be randomized to 1 of 4 treatment groups ( matching placebo or 
SAGE -324: 15 mg , 30 mg, or 60 mg, oral daily) in a 1:1:1:1 ratio , stratified by baseline 
propranolol use (adjunct therapy) .  
• Double -Blind Treatment Period:  Startin g on Day 1 , after randomization, participants will 
receive a single dose of investigational product (IP) once daily for 90 days on an outpatient 
basis, to be taken before bed, with a snack if bedtime is not within 2 hours of the evening 
meal.  Guidance on s uitable snacks will be provided. During the Treatment Period, 
participants will return to the study center for efficacy and safety assessments as specified in  
Table  2. In addition,  safety  phone call study visit s will be conducted according to Table  2, or 
more often as deemed appropriate by  the investigator, to review the current status of the 

Clinical Protocol   Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
Study 324 -ETD -202, version 6.0  CONFIDENTIAL  
 7  participant. Participants will be trained on the use of software applications and devices 
necessary to complete questionnaires or self -rated study assessments.  
Partici pants should gain experience with the study drug to see how it affects them 
before engaging in potentially hazardous activities requiring mental alertness, such as 
driving.   If participants experience any sleepiness , dizziness, or feelings of relaxation, 
or have other sedative effects, they should not engage in potentially hazardous 
activities requiring mental alertness, such as driving, until any sleepiness/sedative 
effects from the study drug have dissipated.   This is important because study 
participants may not be able to judge how these sedative effects will affect their ability 
to perform potentially hazardous activities requiring mental alertness, including 
driving.  
• Follow -Up Period:  Follow -up visits will be con ducted on an outpatient basis on Days 97 and 
104. Participants will continue to complete questionnaires as indicated in Table  2 and will 
return to the cli nic approximately 6 days after the last dose of IP (ie, Day  97) for efficacy and 
safety monitoring. Participants will return to the study center for an End of Study (EOS) Visit 
approximately 1 3 days following the last dose of IP (ie, Day 104); the Early Termination  
Visit  (ETV)  will be conducted at the time of discontinuation if this occurs any time before 
Day 104.  
No dose reductions of SAGE -324 will be permitted.  
All participants who conclude the study will be offered the opportunity to enroll in a SAGE -324 
long-term open -label study, as per the long -term open -label study’s eligibility criteria.  
Number of Participants (planned): Approximately 160 participants , with at least 104 (65%, 
26 participants per dose group) monotherapy participants and up  to 56 (35%, 14 participants per dose 
group)  adjunct therapy participants , will be randomized  to ensure at least 22 participants per arm in

 10  Investigational Product Therapy Dosage and Mode of Administration:  
SAGE -324 will be administered orally once daily, to be taken before bed, with a snack if bedtime is 
not within 2 hours of the evening meal.  
The 15 -mg dose group will receive 15 mg of SAGE -324 from Day 1 to Day 90.  
The 30 -mg dose group will receive 30 mg of SAGE -324 from Day 1 to Day 90.  
The 60 -mg dose group will receive 15 mg of SAGE -324 from Day 1 to Day 14, then 30  mg from 
Day 15 to Day 28, then 45 mg from Day 29 to Day 42, and then 60 mg from Day 43 to Day  90. 
Reference Therapy Dosage and Mode of Admin istration:  
Placebo will be administered orally once daily for 90 days.  
Duration of Treatment:  
Each participant will receive SAGE -324 or matching placebo oral tablets for 90  days.  
Statistical Methods:  
A separate statistical analysis plan (SAP) will provide a detailed description of the data analyses to be 
performed in the study. The SAP will be finalized and approved prior to database lock.  
General Considerations  
For the purpose of all efficacy and saf ety analyses where applicable, baseline is defined as the last 
measurement prior to the start of IP administration.  
Continuous endpoints will be summarized with number (n), mean, standard deviation, median, 
minimum, and maximum. In addition, change from ba seline values will be calculated at each time 
point and summarized descriptively. For categorical endpoints, descriptive summaries will include 
counts and percentages.   
Analysis Sets  
The Randomized Set is defined as all participants who are randomized.  
The Safety Set will include all participants who were administered IP.  
The Full Analysis Set will include all randomized participants who received any amount of IP and 
have a baseline and at least one postbaseline total TETRAS Performance Subscale Item 4 up per limb 
tremor score.  
 
 
The Per Protocol Set will include all participants in the Full Analysis Set without any major protocol 
deviations tha t could affect efficacy. The review of major protocol deviations will be completed, and 
the decision on whether the deviation affects efficacy will be documented before database unblinding.  
Determination of Sample Size  
The planned sample size is 160 participants, randomized in a 1:1:1:1 ratio  to each of the dose group s 
(matching placebo and SAGE -324: 15 mg, 30 mg, and 60 mg) , stratified by baseline propranolol use , 
with at least  104 (65%, 26 participants per dose group ) monotherapy  partic ipants and up to 56 (35%, 
14 participants per dose group ) adjunct therapy participants .  
The sample size of 104 participants for the monotherapy cohort  assumes a change from baseline at 
Day 91 in TETRAS upper limb Item 4 score for the placebo group of -1.2 points, a maximum 
decrease of -3.2 points from baseline for  a dose response in  the 15-mg to 60-mg dose group s with a 
standard deviation of 2.5. Under these assumptions  with a few prespecified candidate dose -response 
models, including linear, loglinear, quadratic, exponential, logistic, Emax, sigEmax and beta , a 
sample size of 2 2 evaluable participants per group would provide 80% power for demonstrating a 
nonflat  dose-response relationship  by Multiple Comparisons and Modeling  (MCP -Mod ) approach , 

Clinical Protocol   Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
Study 324 -ETD -202, version 6.0  CONFIDENTIAL  
 11  using a 1 -sided type I error rate of 0.05. Assuming a nonevaluable rate of  15% across all treatment 
groups, approximately 1 04 participants ( 26 per treatment group) will be randomized . Additional 
monotherapy participants may be enrolled if the overall nonevaluable rate is higher than 20%.  
The sample size for adjunct therapy cohort  is not based on statistical significance, but clinical 
considerat ions. Up to 56 adjunct  therapy participants (14 per dose group) are to provide some adjunct 
therapy directional data on both efficacy and safety measures.  
Additional participants may be randomized if the variances during the blinded interim analysis are 
larger than the assumptions above . However, no more than 200 participants , including adjunct therapy 
participants , will be randomized .  
Statistical Analysis of Primary Efficacy Endpoint  
The estimand for the primary and secondary efficacy endpoint is define d as follows:  
1. There are 4 treatment groups for the monotherapy participants to be evaluated: SAGE -324 
(15 mg, 30  mg, 60  mg) and placebo.  
2. The target population consists of the monotherapy participants age s 18 to 80 years and have a 
diagnosis of ET with com bined total upper limb TETRAS Performance Subscale Item 4 of at 
least 12 with the dominant upper limb score of at least 6 and baseline TETRAS ADL score of 
at least 20.  
3. The outcome for the primary efficacy endpoint is the change from baseline in TETRAS 
Performance Subscale Item 4 score on Day 91.  
4. The population -level summary measure is the dose -response of different doses of SAGE -324 
and placebo  for the mo notherapy cohort .  
5. The treatment/hypothetical policy strategy will be adopted for the primary and secon dary 
endpoint . For data collected after the intercurrent events, such as rescue medication, the 
treatment policy strategy will be used . For data not available after the intercurrent events, like 
premature discontinuation of study treatment, the hypothetica l policy strategy will be 
adopted . This means that the dose -responses of different dose groups will be analyzed using  
all observed on -study data, regardless of the occurrence of the intercurrent event, including 
use of additional medication, premature discontinuation of treatment for any reason, or other 
protocol violations.  
This will first be analyzed using a mixed -effects model for repeated measures (MMRM); the model 
will include treatment, baseline TETRAS Performance Subscale Item 4 upper limb tremor score, 
assessment timepoint, and timepoint -by-treatment as explanatory variables. All explanatory variables 
will be tre ated as fixed effects. All postbaseline clinic visits will be included in the model. An 
unstructured covariance structure will be used to model the within -participant  errors. If there is a 
convergence issue with the unstructured covariance model, Toeplitz or Autoregressive (1) [AR(1)] 
covariance structure will be used, following this sequence until convergence is achieved. If the model 
still does not converge with AR(1) structure, no results will be reported. When the covariance 
structure is not unstructure d, the sandwich estimator for the variance covariance matrix will be 
derived, using the EMPIRICAL option in the PROC MIXED statement in SAS.  
After the MMRM analysis by PROC MIXED, the estimated mean and covariance matrix will be 
passed to the MCP -Mod analysis  to test the dose -response relationship. In the analysis, multiple 
dose-response candidate models will be prespecified. The actual dose -response relationship will be 
assessed using the estimated means and covariance matrix from  MMRM analysis. A cri tical value 
will be determined from the joint multivariate normal distribution of the contrast test statistics at the 
overall one -sided alpha level of 0.05. If the test statistic exceeds this critical value, a nonflat  
dose-response relationship will be dem onstrated.  
Secondary efficacy endpoints will be analyzed similarly to the primary endpoint .

 12  Safety Analysis  
Safety and tolerability of study drug will be evaluated  in each stratum (monotherapy cohort and 
adjunct therapy cohort) and overall  using  incidence of TEAEs/serious adverse events   
and changes from baseline in vital signs, clinical laboratory evaluations , 12-lead ECG . 
Safety 
data will also be listed by participant using the Safety Set.  
 
 
Interim Analysis  
A blinded interim look at the primary and secondary endpoint data may be conducted to evaluate the 
sample size assumptions .

 24  5. INTRODUCTION  
SAGE -324 is a positive allosteric modulator of A -type γ -aminobutyric acid -gated chloride 
channel (GABA A) receptors, the major class of inhibitory neurotransmitter receptors in the brain. 
SAGE -324 is planned to be  evaluated  for multiple indications affected by activity at the GABA A 
receptor, including essential tremor  (ET) . 
Clinical studies of SAGE -324 in heal thy adults and in adults with ET, in addition to preclinical 
studies of SAGE -324, are detailed in the SAGE -324 investigator’s brochure  as well as a  detailed 
description of the chemistry, pharmacology, efficacy, and safety of SAGE -324. 
ET is a common, perma nently debilitating, neurologically determined movement disorder 
characterized by involuntary rhythmic oscillation of a body part due to intermittent muscle 
contractions . This shaking  typically occur s during voluntary  movement  (ie, when not at rest ), 
thus interfering with fine motor skills associated with daily activities ( Olanow 2008 , Deuschl 
2011 , Hopfner 2016 , NIH 2019 ). Although the pathophysiology and etiology of ET is not fully 
understood, it is postulated that approximately 50% of ET patients feature an autosomal 
dominant pattern of familial inheritance and that non -inherited cases may have toxin -based or 
other causali ty (Olanow 2008 , Hopfner 2016 ). ET is the most common movement disorder in the 
United States  and worldwide , with prevalence estimated to be approximately 2.2% of the 
population, representing a substantial societal medical burden with over an estimated 7 million 
ET patients in the US alone (Louis 2014 ). 
In general, active tasks of daily life are adversely impacted by ET, including but not limited to 
speech, handwriti ng, household tasks, and occupational demands, contributing negatively to 
psychosocial well -being, general anxiety, and overall quality of life  (Koller 1989 ). Although 
benign in term s of its effect on life expectancy, ET is a  progressive neurodegenerative condition 
whose symptoms are typically disabling, often forcing patients to change jobs or seek early 
retirement (Zappia 2013 ). In some cases, serious disability may ensue.   
Current first -line t herapies, propranolol and primidone, are the most commonly used medications 
for the treatment of ET. These therapies reduce tremor by >50% in 40% of people ( Koller 1994 ), 
while up to 30% of patients do not respond to first -line therapy o r experience intolerable adverse 
effects ( Koller 1989 ). The only Food and Drug Administration ( FDA )-approved pharmacological 
treatment for ET is propranolol, a β -adrenergi c receptor antagonist. Because of its non -selective 
mechanism of action, not all individuals with ET are able to take propranolol due to 
contraindications such as asthma, heart failure, and diabetes (propranolol Prescribing 
Information). In addition, propr anolol is not always well tolerated, mainly due to fatigue and 
similar adverse reactions, as well as rare serious adverse reactions ( Olanow 2008 , Wyeth 2010 ). 
Secondary pharmacologic approaches to the treatment of ET have included off -label use of 
anticonvulsants with limited GABA activity (eg, topiramate, gabapentin) and the use of alcohol 
(Rajput 2014 ). Notably, tolerability is a key limiting factor of propranolol, primidone, and 
similar therapies utilized by ET patients.  
Five clinical pharmacolo gy studies (324 -CLP-101, 324 -CLP-102, 324 -CLP-104, 324 -CLP-105, 
and 324 -CLP-106) and 1 efficacy study (324 -ETD -201) a re complete . The results of these 
clinical studies suggest that SAGE -324 may safely ameliorate symptoms in patients suffering 
from ET .  
Clinical Protocol   Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
Study 324 -ETD -202, version 6.0  CONFIDENTIAL  
 25  With a GABA A receptor -based mechanism of action featuring  positive allosteric modulation  
capability, SAGE -324 represents a novel approach to the treatment of ET, which may help 
address the unmet medical need of the ET population, warranting further study o f SAGE -324 as 
a potential treatment for this common movement disorder.  Hence, this double -blind, 
placebo -controlled efficacy and safety study of SAGE -324 will be conducted in adults and is 
designed to assess the effect of  15, 30, and 60 mg doses of  SAGE -324 on outcome measures 
specific to ET  . 
5.1. Dose Justification  
Sage has completed 2 studies of SAGE -324 in participants with ET with promising results:  a 
Phase 1 open -label, single, ascending -dose study ( 324-CLP-101) and a Phase 2 double -blind 
study (324-ETD -201) of once daily 60 mg of SAGE -324 or placebo for 28 days .  
One dose  (60 mg) , the highest dose from the 324-CLP-101 study , was evaluated in 
Study 324-ETD -201 to maximize the chance of seeing a pharmacodynamic effect. 
Study  324-ETD -201 met its prespecified  primary endpoint while somnolence was the most 
common adverse event  (AE) reported .  
The present study (324-ETD -202) is a 90 -day, placebo -controlled , dose-ranging study of 15, 30 , 
and 60 mg of SAGE -324 in participants with moderate to severe ET . Given the safety and 
efficacy profile of SAGE -324 to date, the widest possible exposure range of doses over a 90 -day 
period will be administered in order to determine the optimal balance of efficacy and tolerability 
over a wide range of doses.  
In order to m itigate  the AE of somnolence that was observed in Study 324-ETD -201, nighttime 
dosing will be employed for all 3 doses as well as an up-titration to the 60 mg dose (Section 7.3). 
Up-titration is a standard practice that is designed to allow participants to accommodate to the 
AE as plasma concentrations rise more slowly than they would if the target dose was 
administered from the start .  
5.2. Benefit/Risk Assessment  
Potential benefits and  risks anticipated in this study are based on available data from 5 completed 
clinical pharmacology studies (324 -CLP-101, 324 -CLP-102, 324 -CLP-104, 324 -CLP-105, and 
324-CLP-106) and 1 completed efficacy study ( 324-ETD -201), as well as toxicology studies of 
SAGE -324. Available nonclinical and clinical data are summarized in the SAGE -324 
investigator’s brochure . 
Based on the mechanism of action of SAGE -324 and the results of completed nonclinical  and 
clinical  studies of SAGE -324, participants receiving SAGE -324 may have tremor reduction and 
improved quality of life. There is also currently  no evidence of any in teraction (s) (drug -drug or 
other , including propranolol ) except for those outlined in the inclusion/exclusion criteria.  
In a Phase 2,  randomized, double -blind , placebo -controlled study (324-ETD -201), a statistically 
significant treatment difference for SAGE -324 versus placebo was observed for the primary 
efficacy endpoint ( -1.07; 95% confidence  interval: -2.14 to 0.00; p = 0.0491 ), and clinically 
meaningful effects were reported by participants. In addition, the sensitivity analyses showed 
consistency of the primary endpoint results, and subgroup analyses demonstrated a treatment 
difference for SAGE -324 versus placebo for most  subgroups. Also , a statistically significant

Study 324 -ETD -202, version 6.0  CONFIDENTIAL  
 26  reduction from baseline in The Essential Tremor Rating Assessment Scale ( TETRAS ) 
Performance Subscale item 4 upper limb tremor score at Day 29 was observed in a population 
with baseline upper limb tremor score of ≥12 (p = 0.0066). Overall, the primary endpoint 
analyses have demonstrated potentially positive and therapeutic effects of SAGE -324 in 
participants suffering from ET. 
In clinical experience to date , treatment -emergent adverse events ( TEAEs ) of somnolence, 
feeling of relaxation, and dizziness have been most frequently reported. Most of the somnolence, 
dizziness,  and feeling of relaxation  events  were mild or moderate . Severe serious adverse  events 
(SAEs) of mental  status change s were considered related to investigational product  (IP) by the 
investigator s. Some of reported  events required dose reduction or study discontinuation but  all 
events  resolved without sequalae or requir ing treatment.  Participants in the current study will be 
dosed at nighttime and a blinded up -titration to the highest dose (60  mg) will be employed to 
mitigate  the most commonly reported AE of somnolence in previous studies . Study participants 
will be closely monitored d uring  scheduled visits , via phone calls in  between clinic vis its, or 
more frequently for AE monitoring  as appropriate .  
Given the outcome of the Phase 2 study  and the unmet need in the treatment of ET , further 
investigation of SAGE -324 in patients with ET is justified based on a favorable benefit -risk 
profile .

7.1. Overall Study Design  
This study is a Phase 2, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, dose -ranging study to 
evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of SAGE -324 in participants  with ET. Participants, 
site staff, and sponsor personnel will be blinded to treatment allocations.  The study is 
schematically presented in Figure  2. 
Figure  2: Study Design  
 
Abbreviation: R = TETRAS = The Essential Tremor Rating Assessment Scale  
Note: The Screening Period may be extended for an additional 14 days  (total of 42 days) for subjects requiring 
additional time to taper ET medication (other than propranolol) , after approval from the sponsor . 
 
This study includes a Screening Period of up to 28 days, a 90 -day double -blind Treatment Period 
(90 days of dosing), and a 14 -day Follow -up Period.  After providing informed consent, 
participants will undergo screening assessments to determine eligibility as outlined in Table  2. 
Screening Period: The Screening Period begins with the signing of the informed consent form 
(ICF). Eligible participants will visit the study cen ter on Day 1 and complete additional 
eligibility and baseline assessments, as specified in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table  2). The 
Screening Period may  be extended for an additional 14 days  (total of 42 days) for subjects 
requiring additional time to taper ET medication (other than propranolol) , after approval from the 
sponsor . Following completion of screening and Day 1 eligibility assessments, participants will 
be randomized to 1 of 4 treatment groups (placebo or SAGE -324: 15 mg , 30 mg, or 60  mg, oral 
daily) in a 1:1:1:1 ratio , stratified by baseline propranolol use (adjunct therapy) .  
Double -Blind Treatment Period : Starting on Day 1 , after rand omization , participants will 
receive a single dose of IP once daily for 90 days on an outpatient basis, to be taken  before bed, 
with a snack if bedtime is not within 2  hours of the evening meal.  Guidance on suitable snacks 
will be provided. During the Trea tment Period, participants will return to the study center for 
efficacy and safety assessments as specified in  Table  2. In addition, safety  phone call study visits 
will be conducted according to Table  2, or more often as deemed appropriate by  the investigator, 
to review the current status of the participant. Participants will be trained on the use of software 
applications and devices necessary to complete questionnaires or self -rated study assessments .

 30  Participants should gain experience with the study drug to see how it affects them before 
engaging in potentially hazardous activities requiring mental alertness, such as driving.  If 
participants experience any sleepiness, dizziness, or feelings of relaxation, or have other sedative 
effects, they should not engage in potentially hazardous activ ities requiring mental alertness, 
such as driving, until any sleepiness/sedative effects from the study drug have dissipated.  This is 
important because study participants may not be able to judge how these sedative effects will 
affect their ability to per form potentially hazardous activities requiring mental alertness, 
including driving.  
Follow -up Period : Follow -up visits will be conducted on an outpatient basis on Days 97 and 
104. Participants will continue to complete questionnaires as indicated in Table  2 and will return 
to the clinic approximately 6 days after the last dose of IP (ie, Day  97) for efficacy and safety 
monitoring. Participants will re turn to the study center for an End of Study (EOS) visit 
approximately 1 3 days following the last dose of IP (ie, Day 104); the EOS visit will be 
conducted at the time of discontinuation if this occurs any time before Day 104.  
No dose reductions of SAGE -324 will be permitted.  
All participants who conclude  the study will be offered the opportunity to enroll to a SAGE -324 
long-term open -label study , as per the long -term open -label study’s eligibility criteria.  
7.2. Number of Participants  
Approximately 160 particip ants, with at least 104 (65% , 26 participants per dose group)  
monotherapy  participants and up to 56 (35% , 14 participants per dose group)  adjunct  therapy 
participants , will be randomi zed to ensure at least 22 participants per arm in the monotherapy 
cohort will complete the study .  
7.3. Treatment Assignment  
This is a randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled study. Participants will be random ized in 
a 1:1:1:1 ratio  to treatment group s (15 mg, 30 mg, 60 mg SAGE -324, or placebo) , stratified by 
baseline propranol ol use . 
SAGE -324 or matching placebo will be administered orally once daily, to be taken  before bed, 
with a snack if bedtime is not within 2 hours of the evening meal .  
The placebo dose group will receive matching placebo from Day 1 to Day 90.  
The 15 -mg SAGE -324 dose group will receive 15 mg of SAGE -324 from Day 1 to Day 90.  
The 30 -mg SAGE -324 dose group will receive 30 mg of SAGE -324 from Day 1 to Day 90.  
The 60 -mg SAGE -324 dose group will receive 15 mg of SAGE -324 from Day 1 to Day 14, then 
30 mg from Day 15 to Day 28, then 45 mg from Day 29 to Day 42, and then 60 mg from Day 43 
to Day 90.  
7.4. Dose Adjustment Criteria  
Dose adjustments are not allowed in this study.

9.1. Description of Investigational Product  
SAGE -324 is an orally administered tablet provided in 15-mg dose strengths. Participants will 
receive IP (15 mg, 30  mg, or 60 mg total dose of SAGE -324 tablets, or appearance -matched 
placebo tablets) according to the randomization schedule. Additional details regarding IP 
preparation, formulation, and storage are included in Section  10. 
9.2. Prior Medications, Concomitant Medications, Restrictions, and 
Contraception Requirements  
9.2.1.  Prior and Concomitant Medications and/or Supplements  
The start and end dates, route, dose/units, frequency, and indication for all medications and/or 
supplements taken within 30  days prior to signing the informed consent will be recorded.  In 
addition , all psychotropic medications taken in the previous 30 days prior to Screening will be 
recorded. The start and end dates, route, dose/units, and frequency fo r all medications for ET  
taken at any time prior to signing the informed consent are also recorded.  
All medications and/or supplements taken from the dosing of IP on Day 1 through the end of the 
study (including start and end dates route, dose/units, frequency, and indication) will be recorded 
on the eCRF.  Any concomitant medication determined necessary for the welfare of the 
participant may be given at the discretion of the investigator at any time during the study.  
9.2.2.  Prohibited Medications  
Use or consu mption of the following is prohibited for the timeframes specified:  
• Any e strogen -containing products that are widely absorbed into the systemic 
circulation ( eg, oral, transdermal, transvaginal, etc.) , used for any indication , are 
prohibited from Day -14 and during the study . 
• Treatment with an investigational drug or device during the 30 days or 5 half -lives (if 
known) of the investigational drug, whichever is longer, prior to Day 1  or during the 
study .  
• New treatment with tremorgenic drugs within 14 days o r 5 half -lives (whichever is 
longer) of Day  1 or during the study.  Continued use  of established treatment with 
tremorgenic drugs is permitted  if there  is no evidence of previous or current concerns 
for these medications to cause or exacerbate tremor  as determined by investigator . 
• Use of agents known to affect SAGE -324 drug metabolism (any known moderate or 
severe cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors and/or inducers) within 14 days or 5 half -
lives (whichever is longer) of Day 1 and through Day 90 of the stu dy period. Use of 
mild cytochrome inhibitors and/or inducers may be permitted.  
• Concomitant  use of sedative/hypnotic drugs  for 14 days or 5 half -lives prior to Day 1 
and during the 90-day dosing period.  
• As needed [PRN]  propranolol use during the study . 
Clinical Protocol   Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
Study 324 -ETD -202, version 6.0  CONFIDENTIAL  
 38  9.2.2.1.  Pres tudy E ssential Tremor  Medications Washout  
• Any prior ET medications  other than propranolol must be discontinued prior to the 
Screening TETRAS:  
− There must be at least 14 days or 5 half -lives (whichever is longer) washout 
period prior to the Day 1 (baseline) visit.   
− For drugs requiring down-titration, there must be the required number of days for 
down -titration plus 14 days or 5 half -lives (whichever is longer) prior to the Day 1 
(baseline) visit.  
− If necessary, screening assessments may be split between 2  visits in order  to allow 
enough  time for washout or down -titration and washout  of prior ET therapy 
during the screening period . 
• Prior ET medications may be restarted following Day 97  of the study.   
• Participants in the  adjunct  therapy cohort must be on a stable dose of propranolol 
(maximum total daily propranolol dose up to 320 mg allowed) from 3 months prior to 
Screening through Day 97 of the  study  (no additional propranolol as needed [PRN] is 
allowed) . 
9.2.3.  Other Restrictions   
• Use of any drugs of  abuse during the study period  is prohibited. Note: participants 
with a history of drug abuse prior to Screening should not be enrolled in the study.  
• Use of alcohol is limited to 2 units per  day for males and 1 unit per day for females 
starting at least 1 week prior to Day 1 and through Day 9 7 of the study.  
A unit of alcohol is defined as: 12 ounces of regular beer, 5 ounces of wine, or  
1.5 ounces of distilled spirits.   
Participant will limit alcohol use to at least 2 hours before self -administration of IP in 
the evening.  
Participant will not use alcohol starting 24 hours prior to  the scheduled in -clinic study 
visits until all assessments have been completed .  
• Participan ts should gain experience with the study drug to see how it affects them 
before engaging in potentially hazardous activities requiring mental alertness, such as 
driving.  If participants experience any sleepiness, dizziness, or feelings of relaxation, 
or have other sedative effects, they should not engage in potentially hazardous 
activities requiring mental alertness, such as driving, until any sleepiness/sedative 
effects from the study drug have dissipated.  This is important because study 
participants may  not be able to judge how these sedative effects will affect their 
ability to perform potentially hazardous activities requiring mental alertness, 
including driving.  
• Use of products that contain nicotine is maintained at prestudy levels starting at least 
1 week prior to Day 1 and through Day  97 of the study period. Participants with 
nicotine use disorder that impacts their tremor are excluded . 
Clinical Protocol   Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
Study 324 -ETD -202, version 6.0  CONFIDENTIAL  
 39  • Consumption of grapefruit juice, grapefruit, Seville oranges, pomegranates, tangelos, 
or St. John’s Wort or products containing these within 30 days prior to Day 1 and 
through Day 90 of the study period  is prohibited .  
• Use of stimulants, highly caffeinated  beverages , or dietary supplements containing 
high doses of caffeine within  14 days or five half -lives, whichever is longer, prior to 
the Day 1 visit  and through Day 90 of the study period is prohibited . Note: 
participants should not increase their regular  daily consumption of caffeine during the 
study period.  
• The use of medications other than f exofenadine for chronic allergies is recommended 
during partic ipation  in the study . 
• Use of Cala Trio bracelet for the treatment of ET from two weeks prior to Day 1 
through Day 97  is prohibited . 
9.2.4.  Acceptable Forms of Contraception  
As per the Clinical Trials Facilitation and Coordination Group (CTFG), a woman  is considered 
of childbearing potential ( WOCBP) , ie, fertile, following menarche and until becoming 
postmenopausa l unless permanently sterile. Permanent sterilization methods include 
hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy , and bilateral oophorectomy.  
A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an alternative medical 
cause. A high follicle sti mulating hormone (FSH) level in the postmenopausal range may be used 
to confirm a postmenopausal state in females  not using hormonal contraception or hormonal 
replacement therapy. However, in the absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, a single FSH 
measurement  is insufficient.  
A male is considered fertile after puberty unless permanently sterile by bilateral orchidectomy.  
Acceptable forms of highly effective contraception (ie, can achieve a failure rate of <1% per year 
when used consistently and correctly) for participants of childbearing potential or for partners of 
male participants who are of childbearing potential include  the following  list.  
• Progestogen -only oral, injectable, intravaginal, implantable, or transdermal hormonal 
contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation . The use of estrogen -containing 
contraceptives that are widely absorbed into the systemic circulation are prohibited.  
• Intrauterine device  
• Intrauterine hormone -releasing system  
• Bilateral tubal occlusion  or bilateral tubal ligation  (performed at least 3  months prior 
to screening)  
• Vasectomized partner (performed at least 3 months prior to screening)  
• Sexual abstinence (no sexual intercourse)  
Acceptable forms of contraception for male participants include:  
• Sexual abstinence (no sexual i ntercourse)  
• History of vasectomy (performed at least 3 months prior to screening ) 
Clinical Protocol   Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
Study 324 -ETD -202, version 6.0  CONFIDENTIAL  
 40  • Condom with spermicide used together with highly effective female contraceptive 
methods if the female partner(s) is of childbearing potential (see above for list of 
acceptable female contraceptive methods)  
Acceptable forms of contraception which may not be considered as highly effective include:  
• Oral progestogen -only hormonal contraception, where inhibition of ovulation is not 
the primary mode of action  
• Male or femal e condom with or without spermicide  
• Cap, diaphragm , or sponge with spermicide  
• A combination of male condom with either cap, diaphragm , or sponge with 
spermicide (double barrier methods) are also considered acceptabl e 
9.3. Intervention after the End of the Stu dy 
All participants who conclude  the study will be offered the opportunity to enroll in a SAGE -324 
long-term open --label study , as per the long -term open-label study’s eligibility  criteria . 
9.4. Treatment Adherence  
Participants will be dispensed IP starting on Day 1 and at each clinic visit for use at home prior 
to the next clinic visit  with instructions specifying that IP is to be  administer before bed, with a 
snack if bedtime is not within 2 hours of the evening meal . Treatment adherence will be 
monitored by  the site staff at each in -clinic visit by direct questioning and counting returned 
tablets  and will be documented. Details on drug accountability are included in  Section  10. 
Patients will be asked to record the dates and times of their IP dose administrations at home in a 
diary. They will also record the  number of tablets taken and if it was taken with food .  
9.5. Randomization and Blinding  
This is a randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled study. Participants will be random ized in 
a 1:1:1:1 ratio  to treatment group s (15 mg, 30 mg, 60 mg SAGE -324, or placebo) stratified by 
baseline propranolol use  (adjunct therapy) . Participants, site staff, a nd the sponsor will be 
blinded to treatment allocation  (see study schematic in  Figure  2).  
Randomization schedules will be generated by an independent sta tistician. The randomization 
schedules will be kept strictly confidential, accessible only to authorized personnel until the time 
of unblinding. The blinding of the study  will be broken after the database has been locked.  
9.5.1.  Emergency Unblinding  
During the st udy, the blind is to be broken only when the safety of a participant is at risk and the 
treatment plan is dependent on the study treatment received. Unless a participant is at immediate 
risk, the investigator should  make diligent attempts to contact the sponsor  prior to unblinding the 
IP administered to a participant. Request s from the investigator about the treatment administered 
to study participants should  be discussed with the medical monitor . If the unblinding occurs 
without the sponsor ’s knowledge, the investigator must notify the sponsor  within 24 hours of 
breaking the blind. All circumstances surrounding a premature unblinding must be clearly 
documented in the source records .  
Clinical Protocol   Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
Study 324 -ETD -202, version 6.0  CONFIDENTIAL  
 41  In all cases where study personnel are  unblinded, pertinent information (including the reason for 
unblinding) must be documented in the participant’s source documentation  and in the IRT . At 
the time of withdrawal from the study/stopping participation, if possible, an EOT and/or ET V 
should be conducted .

will be kept in the study files.  
Site st aff will access the interactive response technology ( IRT) at the Screening Visit to obtain a 
participant identification (ID) number for each participant that has signed an ICF. On Day 1, site 
staff will access the IRT and provide the necessary participant -identifying information, including 
the participant ID number assigned at Screening, to randomize the eligible participant into the 
study and obtain the IP ID number for the IP to be dispensed to that participant. The IP ID 
number and the number of tablets dispensed must be recorded.  
At subsequent IP -dispensing visit s, the investigator or designee will access the IRT, providing 
the same participant ID number assigned at Screening, to obtain the IP ID number for the IP to 
be dispensed at that visit. The IP ID number, the number of tablets dispensed, and the number of 
tablets returned by the participant at each visit must be recorded.  
If dispensing errors or discrepancies are discovered by site staff or sponsor’s designee, the 
sponsor must be notified immediat ely. 
The IP provided is for use only as directed in this protocol. The Investigator or designee must 
keep a record of all IP received, used , and returned/discarded.  
Sage Therapeutics will be permitted access to the study supplies at any time with appropriate 
notice during or after completion of the study to perform drug accountability reconciliation.  
The investigator, pharmacist, or qualified designee is responsible for drug accountability, 
reconciliation, and record maintenance (ie, receipt, reconciliation, and final disposition records).  
At the end of the study, any unused IP will be returned to Sage Therapeutics for destruction or 
destroyed locally per the site’s procedures; disposition of IP will be documented.  
10.7. Product Complaints

 45  11. EFFICACY  
11.1. Efficacy Assessments  
11.1.1.  The Essential Tremor Rating Assessment Scale  
TETRAS is a v alidated, comprehensive clinical assessment of ET (Elble 2013 ).  
The TETRAS ADL Subscale  and the TETRAS P erformance Subscale  will both be assessed at 
each clinic visit as specified in the Schedule of Assessments under TETRAS (Table  2).  
The Performance Subscale assesses  overall rating of tremor in the voice, limbs, head, face, trunk, 
while performing prespecified  tasks, and als o measures functional task capabilities, ie, 
handwriting, spirography, and holding a pen over a dot. Each of these items is rated on a scale 
from 0 (no tremor) to 4 (severe tremor). Collectively, the performance items generate an overall 
performance score from 0 to 64.  
For Item 4 upper limb tremor  of the Performance Subscale , all 3 maneuvers in the upper limb 
assessments  (subscale items 4a, 4b, and 4c) will be completed for both arms, first for the right  
arm and then for the left. Item 4 subscale ordinally rates postural (limbs extended forward 
maneuver, and wing -beating [elbows flexed] maneuver), and kinetic (finger -nose-finger 
maneuver) tremor on a 0 to 4 severity scale in 0.5 -point increments.   
The ADL Subscale assesses how ET affect s typical ADL  (ie, speech, eating, drinking, dressing, 
personal hygiene, writing, occupational impairment, social impact, and activities affected by 
upper limb tremor). It consists of 12 items that are each rated on a scale from 0  (normal activity) 
to 4 (s evere abnormality). The overall ADL score range is 0 to 48.  
The ADL composite  endpoint comprises Items 1 to 11 of the ADL Subscale and Item 6 of the 
Performance Subscale.  
Responses of  0 and 1  in TETRAS ADL Subscale item 1  to 11 and performance Subscale 6 will 
be collapsed and analyzed as a single response of 0  = normal /slightly abnormal  such that the 
scale becomes:   
0 = Normal/slightly abnormal  
1 = Mildly abnormal  
2 = Moderately abnormal  
3 = Severely abnormal  
In this study, a videographer will videotape TETRAS administration  at Screening . 
Every effort should be made for the same rater to perform all TETRAS assessments for an 
individual participant  and where possible,  other assessments conducted by a separate  site 
personnel.  
Prior medications for ET  must be discontinued prior to Screening TETRAS rating s (see 
Section  9.2.2.1  for washout periods).

 50  12. SAFETY ASSESSMENTS  
12.1. Safety Parameters  
All assessments will be conducted according to the Schedule of Assessments ( Table  2). 
Any abnormality in physical examinations, vital signs, ECGs, or clinical laboratory test results 
outsi de of the normal range will be interpreted by an investigator as clinically significant or not 
clinically significant in source documents.  
12.1.1.  Demography and Medical History  
Demographic characteristics (age, race, sex, ethnicity) and a full medical history , including 
concomitant medications and supplements , products that contain nicotine , and alcohol use , will 
be documented.  
12.1.2.  Weight and Height  
Height and weight will be measured and documented. BMI will be calculated and documented.  
12.1.3.  Physical Examination  
Complete physical examinations and a comprehensive neurological examination, including 
mental state examinations, should be performed at Screening and EOT and as clinically 
necessary . Whenever possible, the same individual should perform all physical exami nations. 
Complete p hysical examinations will include assessment of body systems (eg, head, eyes, ears, 
nose, and throat; heart; lungs; abdomen; and extremities) as well as cognitive and neurological 
examination and mental status examination. Targeted physi cal and neurological examinations 
should be performed at other times as indicated by AEs, per the investigator’s discretion.  
12.1.4.  Vital Signs  
Vital signs comprise heart rate, respiratory rate, temperature, and blood pressure. Systolic and 
diastolic blood pressu re are to be measured after the participant has been supine for at least 
5 minutes prior to the measurement. Orthostatic blood pressure and heart rate will also be 
measured after the participant has been in the supine position for at least 5 minutes and th en 
repeated approximately 1 and 3 minutes after standing . On Day 1, supine and standing blood 
pressure and heart rate will be collected in triplicate at least 15 minutes apart.  
12.1.5.  Electrocardiogram  
A 12 -lead ECG will be performed. The standard intervals (hea rt rate, PR, QRS, QT, and QT 
corrected according to Fridericia ’s formula  [QTcF ]) as well as any rhythm abnormalities will be 
recorded.  ECG s will be performed after the participant has been resting in a supine position for 
at least 5 minutes. ECG may be repeated once for confirmatory purposes if initial values 
obtained exceed the limits specified .  
When ECG measurements coincide with safety and efficacy assessments, vital signs assessment 
or blood draws, procedures should be carried out in the following o rder: vital signs, TETRAS, 
ECG, blood sample collection for  clinical laboratory assessments, and questionnaires .

 52  12.1.10.  COVID -19 Questions  
Information regarding diagnosis, isolation, and/or hospitalization due to coronavirus  disease 
2019 ( COVID -19) will be documented at the time points indicated in the Schedule of 
Assessments ( Table  2) and will be repeated as appropriate if a participant reports a COVID -19 
diagnosis during the study. The site will be allowed to follow procedures already in place for 
screening participants f or prior potential COVID -19 exposure. As a result, additional questions 
may be asked of the participant.  
Questions to be asked are as follows:  
26. Were you diagnosed with COVID -19 by a healthcare professional?  
• If the answer is “no”, no further questions.  
• If the answer is “yes”, the following questions are asked:  
− Did you have a test?  If yes, was the result positive, negative, or inconclusive?  
− Were you isolated? If yes, what were the dates of isolation?  
− Were you hospitalized?  If yes, what were the dates of hospit alization?  
27. Did you receive the COVID -19 vaccine?  
• If the answer is “no”, no further questions.  
• If the answer is “yes”, the following questions are asked:  
− What is the reported name of the COVID -19 vaccine you received?  
− Who is the manufacturer of the COVID -19 vaccine you received?  
− On what date(s) did you receive the COVID -19 vaccine?

 53  12.2. Adverse and Serious Adverse Events  
12.2.1.  Adverse Event Definition  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation participant 
administered a pharmaceutic al product and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship 
with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an 
abnormal laboratory finding), symptom or disease temporally associated with the use of a 
medic inal (investigational) product whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) 
product. In clinical studies, an AE can include an undesirable medical condition occurring at any 
time, including baseline or washout periods, even if no study treatme nt has been administered.  
A TEAE is defined as an AE with onset after the start of IP, or any worsening of a pre -existing 
medical condition/AE with onset after the start of IP and throughout the study. The term IP 
includes any Sage IP, a comparator, or a p lacebo administered in a clinical study . 
Laboratory abnormalities and changes from baseline in vital signs and ECGs are considered AEs 
if they result in discontinuation or interruption of study treatment, require therapeutic medical 
intervention, meet prot ocol specific criteria (if applicable) or if the investigator considers them to 
be clinically significant. Any abnormalities that meet the criteria for a n SAE should be reported 
in an expedited manner. Laboratory abnormalities and changes from baseline in vital signs and 
ECGs that are clearly attributable to another AE do not require discrete reporting (eg,  electrolyte 
disturbances in the context of dehydration, chemistry , and hematologic disturbances in the 
context of sepsis).  
All AEs that occur after any participant has signed the informed consent and throughout the 
duration of the study, whether or not they are related to the study, must be reported to Sage 
Therapeutics.  
Participants who discontinue the IP due to an AE, regardless of investigator -determin ed 
causality, should be followed until the event is resolved, considered stable, or the investigator 
determines the event is no longer clinically significant. Any AEs that are unresolved at the 
participant’s last AE assessment in the study are followed up by the investigator for as long as 
medically indicated, but without further recording in the eCRF. The sponsor or its representative 
retains the right to request additional information for any patient with ongoing AE(s)/SAE(s) at 
the end of the study, if j udged necessary.  
12.2.2.  Serious Adverse Event Definition  
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
• Results in death  
• Places the participant at immediate risk of death (a life -threatening event); however, 
this does not include an event that, had i t occurred in a more severe form, might have 
caused death  
• Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
• Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
• Results in a congenital abnormality or birth defect  
Clinical Protocol   Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
Study 324 -ETD -202, version 6.0  CONFIDENTIAL  
 54  An SA E may also be any other medically important event that, in the opinion of the investigator 
may jeopardize the participant or may require medical intervention to prevent 1 of the outcomes 
listed above (examples of such events include allergic bronchospasm r equiring intensive 
treatment in an emergency room or convulsions occurring at home that do not require an 
inpatient hospitalization).  
All SAEs that occur after any participant has signed the ICF and throughout the duration of the 
study, whether or not they  are related to the study, must be recorded on the SAE report form 
provided by Sage Therapeutics. Any SAE that is ongoing when the participant completes their 
final study visit, will be followed by the investigator until the event has resolved, stabilized,  
returned to baseline status, or until the participant dies or is lost to follow -up. 
A prescheduled or elective procedure or routinely scheduled treatment will not be considered an 
SAE, even if the participant is hospitalized. The site must document all of  the following:  
• The prescheduled or elective procedure or routinely scheduled treatment was 
scheduled (or on a waiting list to be scheduled) prior to obtaining the participant’s 
consent to participate in the study.  
• The condition requiring the prescheduled or elective procedure or routinely scheduled 
treatment was present before and did not worsen or progress, in the opinion of an 
investigator, between the participant’s consent to participate in the study and at the 
time of the procedure or treatment.  
12.2.3.  Relati onship to Investigational Product  
The investigator must make the determination of relationship to the IP for each AE (not related, 
related). The following definitions should be considered when evaluating the relationship of AEs 
and SAEs to the IP.  
Not Rela ted An AE will be considered “not related” to the use of the IP if there is not a reasonable 
possibility that the event has been caused by the IP. Factors pointing towards this 
assessment include but are not limited to: the lack of temporal relationship between 
administration of the IP and the event, the presence of biologically implausible 
relationship between the product and the AE, or the presence of a more likely 
alternative explanation for the AE  
Related  An AE will be considered “related” to the use  of the IP if there is a reasonable 
possibility that the event may have been caused by the product under investigation. 
Factors that point towards this assessment include , but are not limited to: a positive 
rechallenge, a reasonable temporal sequence betwe en administration of the drug and the 
event, a known response pattern of the suspected drug, improvement following 
discontinuation or dose reduction, a biologically plausible relationship between the drug 
and the AE, or a lack of alternative explanation fo r the AE  
12.2.4.  Definition of Urgent Safety Measure and Unanticipated Problem  
In accordance with Article 10(b) of Directive 2001/20/EC, some reported events may result in an 
urgent safety measure  (USM), defined as an action that the sponsor and investigator may take in 
Clinical Protocol   Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
Study 324 -ETD -202, version 6.0  CONFIDENTIAL  
 55  order to protect the participants of a study against any immediate hazard to their health or safety. 
Examples of USMs include:  
• Suspension of enrollment due to significantly higher i ncidence of death at one site  
• Additional clinical or non -clinical investigations performed due to increased 
frequency of AEs  
• Halting a clinical study for safety reasons  
In accordance with FDA Guidance 21 Code of Federal Regulations Part 312.66, some report ed 
events may qualify as an unanticipated problem  (UP), defined as a ny incident, experience, or 
outcome that meets all of the following criteria:  
• Unexpected  (in terms of nature, severity, or frequency) given (i) the research 
procedures that are described i n the protocol -related documents, such as the 
IRB-approved research protocol and informed consent document; and (ii) the 
characteristics of the population being studied; related or possibly related to an 
individual’s participation in the study; and  
• Suggest s the study may place the participant or others at a greater risk of harm 
(including physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) related to the study 
than was previously known or recognized.  
Any UP must be reported within 24 hours of awareness via e mail to Sage  and designee upon 
discovery  due to the urgent reporting requirements to regulators  and IRB(s)/IECs(s). 
12.2.5.  Recording Adverse Events  
AEs spontaneously reported by the participant and/or in response to an open question from the 
study personnel or re vealed by observation will be recorded during the study at the 
investigational site. The AE term should be reported in standard medical terminology when 
possible. For each AE, the investigator will evaluate and report the onset (date and time), 
resolution (date and time), intensity, causality, action taken, outcome and seriousness (if 
applicable), and whether or not it caused the participant to discontinue the IP or withdraw early 
from the study.  
Intensity will be assessed according to the following scale:  
• Mild: symptom(s) barely noticeable to participant or does not make participant 
uncomfortable; does not influence performance or functioning; prescription drug not 
ordinarily needed for relief of symptom(s)  
• Moderate: symptom(s) of a sufficient severity to m ake participant uncomfortable; 
performance of daily activity is influenced; participant is able to continue in study; 
treatment for symptom(s) may be needed  
• Severe: symptom(s) cause severe discomfort; symptoms cause incapacitation or 
significant impact on participant’s daily life; severity may cause cessation of 
treatment with IP; treatment for symptom(s) may be given and/or participant 
hospitalized  
Clinical Protocol   Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
Study 324 -ETD -202, version 6.0  CONFIDENTIAL  
 56  It is important to distinguish between serious and severe AEs. Severity is a measure of intensity 
whereas ser iousness is defined by the criteria under Section  12.2.2 . An AE of severe intensity 
may not necessarily be considered serious.  
12.2.6.  Reporting Serious Adverse Events  
In order to adhere to all applicable laws and regulations for reporting an SAE(s), the study site 
must notify Sage and designee within 24 hours of the study site staff becoming aware of the 
SAE(s). The investigator must complete, sign and da te the SAE report form, verify the accuracy 
of the information recorded on the SAE report form with the corresponding source documents, 
and send a copy to Sage and designee.  
Additional follow -up information, if required or available, should all be sent to Sage and 
designee within 24 hours of receipt on a follow -up SAE report form and placed with the original 
SAE information and kept with the appropriate section of the eCRF and/or study file.  
SAEs occurring after the designated follow -up time for the study, should be reported to Sage and 
designee according to the timelines noted above only if the investigator considers the SAE 
related to IP.  
Sage, or designee, is responsible for notifying the relevant regulatory authorities of certain 
events. It is the princi pal investigator’s responsibility to notify the IRB of all SAEs that occur at 
his or her site. Investigators will also be notified of all suspected unexpected serious adverse 
reactions (SUSARs) that occur during the clinical study. IRBs will be notified of  SAEs and/or 
SUSARs as required by local law.  
In addition, appropriate personnel in Sage Drug Safety and Pharmacovigilance or designee will 
unblind SUSARs for the purpose of regulatory reporting. Sage or designee will submit SUSARs 
(in blinded or unblinded  fashion) to regulatory agencies according to local law. Sage, or 
designee, will submit SUSARs to investigators in a blinded fashion.  
12.3. Pregnancy  
If a participant becomes pregnant after the first administration of IP, pregnancy information must 
be collected and recorded on the Pregnancy Form and submitted to the Sage and designee  within 
24 hours of learning of the pregnancy. Details will be collected for all pregnancies for which 
conception was likely to have occurred after the start of IP administration unti l 5 terminal half -
lives following the last administration of IP or until the completion of the study whichever is 
longer. Any pregnancy occurring in that time frame will be followed until delivery or 
termination of the pregnancy. The investigator will also  attempt to collect pregnancy information 
on any participant’s partner who becomes pregnant after the participant has received the first 
administration of IP. After obtaining the necessary signed informed consent from the pregnant 
partner directly, the inv estigator will follow the same pregnancy reporting procedures specified 
for pregnant participants.  
The participant or participant’s partner will be followed to determine the outcome of the 
pregnancy. The outcome of all pregnancies (eg, spontaneous abortion , elective abortion, normal 
birth) must be followed and documented even if the participant was discontinued from the study. 
The investigator will collect follow -up information on the participant or participant’s partner and 
the neonate, and the information  will be forwarded to Sage and designee  within 24 hours of 
Clinical Protocol   Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
Study 324 -ETD -202, version 6.0  CONFIDENTIAL  
 57  awareness . Generally, follow -up will not be required for longer than 6 to 8 weeks beyond the 
estimated delivery date. Any termination of pregnancy will be reported, regardless of fetal status 
(pres ence or absence of anomalies) or indication for the procedure.  
Pregnancy in itself is not regarded as an AE unless there is a suspicion that an IP may have 
interfered with the effectiveness of a contraceptive medication. Any complication during 
pregnancy ( eg, anemia, infections, pre -eclampsia) should be reported as an AE/SAE. If the 
outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for immediate classification as an SAE (ie, 
spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, neonatal death), the investigator should follow the pro cedures 
for reporting an SAE.  
12.4. Special Considerations  
Drug abuse is the persistent or sporadic, intentional excessive use of IP which is accompanied by 
harmful physical or psychological effects in the participant. If an event of drug abuse occurs 
during the  study, it must be reported to the sponsor and designee (see  Table  1) using the Special 
Considerations Form within 24 hours of the site becoming aware of  the event(s). If the drug 
abuse results in an AE or SAE, the AE or SAE must also be recorded and reported as described 
in Section  12.2.5  and Section  12.2.6 , respectively . 
Drug misuse refers to situations where IP is inten tionally and inappropriately used not in 
accordance with the intended use as specified in the protocol. If an event of drug misuse occurs 
during the study, it must be reported to the sponsor and designee using the Special 
Considerations Form within 24 hour s of the site becoming aware of the event(s). If the  drug 
misuse results in an AE or SAE, the AE or SAE must also be recorded and reported as described 
in Section  12.2.5  and Section  12.2.6 , respectively.  
An overdose is any dose of IP given to a participant or taken by a participant that exceeds th e 
dose described in the protocol. Overdoses are not considered AEs and should not be recorded as 
an AE on the CRF; however, all overdoses must be recorded on the Special Considerations Form 
and sent to Sage and designee within 24 hours of the site becoming  aware of the overdose. An 
overdose must be reported to Sage and designee even if the overdose does not result in an AE. If 
an overdose results in an AE or SAE, the AE or SAE must also be recorded and reported as 
described in Section  12.2.5  and Section  12.2.6 , respectively.  
A medication error is any preventable event that may cause or lead to inappropriate medication 
use or participant harm while the medication is in the control of the healthcare professional, 
participant, or consumer. All medication errors must be recorded on the Special considerations 
form and sent to the sponsor and designee within 24 hours of the site becoming aware of the 
medication error. The medication error must be reported  to the sponsor and/or designee even if 
the medication error does not result in an AE. If a medication error results in an AE or SAE, the 
AE or SAE must also be recorded and reported as described in Section  12.2.5  and Section  12.2.6 , 
respectively .

 58  13. STATISTICS  
A detailed  description of the analyses to be performed in the study will be provided in the 
statistical analysis plan (SAP). The SAP will be finalized and approved prior to database lock. 
Any changes/additions to the SAP following database lock will be described in detail in the 
clinical study report.  
13.1. Data Analysis Sets  
The Randomized Set is defined as all participants who are randomized.  
The Safety Set will include all participants who were administered IP.  
The Full Analysis Set will include all randomized participants who received any amount of IP 
and have a baseline and at least one postbaseline total TETRAS Performance Subscale Item 4  
upper limb tremor score.  
 
 
The Per Protocol Set will include all participants in the Full Analysis Set without any major 
protocol deviations that could affect efficacy. The review of major protocol deviations will be 
completed, and the decision on whether the deviation affects efficacy will be docum ented before 
database unblinding.  
13.2. Handling of Missing Data  
Every attempt will be made to avoid missing data. All participants will be used in the analyses, 
as per the analysis populations, using all nonmissing data available . Sensitivity analyses will  be 
conducted by imput ing missing data  to evaluate the treatment effect .  
13.3. General Considerations  
All participant data, including those that are derived, that support the tables and figures will be 
presented in the participant data listings. Some data may be pre sented only in participant data 
listing, some may be presented with a corresponding table or figure; these will be indicated in 
relevant sections below. All summaries will be provided by treatment group . 
For the purpose of all primary and secondary analyse s where applicable, baseline is defined as 
the last measurement prior to the start  of IP  administration . 
Continuous endpoints will be summarized with number (n), mean, standard deviation, median, 
quartile, minimum, and maximum. In addition, change from bas eline values will be calculated at 
each time point and summarized descriptively. For categorical endpoints, descriptive summaries 
will include frequency counts and percentages.  
13.4. Demographics and Baseline Characteristics  
Demographic data, such as age, race, and ethnicity, and baseline characteristics, such as height, 
weight, and BMI, will be summarized by stratum (monotherapy cohort and adjunct therapy 
cohort) using the Safety Population.  

Clinical Protocol   Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
Study 324 -ETD -202, version 6.0  CONFIDENTIAL  
 59  Medical history will be listed by participant.  
Pregnancy test results a nd drug screen results will be listed but not summarized.  
13.5. Efficacy Analysis  
The estimand for the primary and secondary efficacy endpoint  is defined as follows:  
1. There are 4 treatment groups for the monotherapy participants to be evaluated: 
SAGE -324 (15  mg, 30 mg, 60  mg) and placebo.  
2. The target population consists of the monotherapy  participants age s 18 to 80 years and 
have a diagnosis of ET with combined total upper limb TETRAS Performance Subscale 
Item 4 of at least  12 with the dominant upper limb score of  at least 6 and baseline 
TETRAS ADL sco re of at least 20.  
3. The outcome for the primary efficacy endpoint is the  change from baseline in TETRAS 
Performance Subscale Item 4 score on Day 91 . 
4. The population -level summary measure is the dose -response of different doses of 
SAGE -324 and placebo  for the monotherapy cohort .  
5. The treatment/hypothetical policy strategy will be adopted for the primary and secondary 
endpoint . For data collected after the intercurrent events, such as rescue medication, the 
treatme nt policy strategy will be used . For data not available after the intercurrent events, 
like premature discontinuation of study treatment, the hypothetical policy strategy will be 
adopted . This means that the dose -responses of different dose groups will be analyzed 
using all observed on -study data, regardless of the occurrence of the intercurrent event, 
including use of additional medication, premature discontinuation of treatment for any 
reason, or other protocol violations.  
This will first be analyzed usi ng a mixed -effects model for repeated measures (MMRM); the 
model will include treatment, baseline TETRAS Performance Subscale Item 4 upper limb tremor 
score, assessment timepoint, timepoint -by-baseline TETRAS Performance Subscale Item 4 upper 
limb tremor  score and timepoint -by-treatment as explanatory variables. All explanatory variables 
will be treated as fixed effects. All postbaseline clinic visits will be included in the model. An 
unstructured covariance structure will be used to model the within -partic ipant  errors. If there is a 
convergence issue with the unstructured covariance model, Toeplitz or Autoregressive (1) 
[AR(1)] covariance structure will be used, following this sequence until convergence is achieved. 
If the model still does not converge with  AR(1) structure, no results will be reported. When the 
covariance structure is not unstructured, the sandwich estimator for the variance covariance 
matrix will be derived, using the EMPIRICAL option in the PROC MIXED statement in SAS.  
After the MMRM analy sis by PROC MIXED, the estimated mean and covariance matrix will be 
passed to the Multiple Comparisons and Modeling (MCP -Mod) analysis to test the dose -response 
relationship. In the analysis, multiple dose -response candidate models will be prespecified . The 
actual dose -response relationship will be assessed using the estimated means and covariance 
matrix from  MMRM analysis. A critical value will be determined from the joint multivariate 
normal distribution of the contrast test statistics at the overall one -sided alpha level of 0.05. If the 
test statistic exceeds this critical value, a nonflat  dose-response relationship will be 
demonstrated.  
Clinical Protocol   Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
Study 324 -ETD -202, version 6.0  CONFIDENTIAL  
 60  Secondary efficacy endpoints will be analyzed similarly to the primary endpoint .  
13.6. Safety Analyses  
Safety and tolerabili ty of SAGE -324 will be evaluated by stratum (monotherapy cohort and 
adjunct therapy cohort ) and overall  using  incidence of  TEAEs /SAEs   and changes 
from baseline in vital signs, 12-lead ECGs . 
 Safety data will also be listed by participant using 
the Safety Set.  
13.6.1.  Adverse Events  
AEs will be coded using Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities Version 23.1 or higher. A 
TEAE is defined as an AE with onset after the first dose of IP. The analysis of AEs will be based 
on the concept of TEAEs. The incidence of TEAEs will be summari zed by System Organ Class 
and Preferred Term. In addition, summaries will be provided by intensity (mild, moderate, 
severe) and by causality (related, not related) to IP.  
Any TEAEs leading to discontinuation of treatment or withdrawal from the study and an y 
treatment -emergent SAEs will be summarized.  
All AEs and SAEs (including those with onset or worsening before the start of IP) through the 
end of the study will be listed.  
13.6.2.  Clinical Laboratory Evaluations  
Results of clinical laboratory parameters in each s cheduled visit and mean changes from baseline 
will be summarized in standard units. Normal ranges for each parameter will be provided by the 
laboratory; shift from baseline to postbaseline values in abnormality of results will be provided. 
Potentially clin ically significant values will be summarized by treatment. Clinical laboratory 
results will be listed by participant and timing of collection.  
13.6.3.  Physical Examinations  
The occurrence of a physical examination (yes/no) and the date performed will be listed by 
participant.  
13.6.4.  Vital Signs  
Vital sign results at each visit and mean changes from baseline will be summarized by scheduled 
visit. Potentially clinically significant values will be summarized by treatment. Vital sign results 
will be listed by participant and timing of collection.  
13.6.5.  12-Lead Electrocardiogram  
The following ECG parameters will be listed for ECGs for each participant: heart rate, PR, QRS, 
QT, and QTcF. ECG data will be summarized by visit. Potentially clinically significant values of 
QTcF will be su mmarized by treatment. ECG  findings will be listed by participant and visit.

than 20%.  
The sample size for adjunct therapy  cohort  is not based on statistical significance, but clinical 
considerations. Up to 56 adjunct  therapy  participants (14 per dose group) are to provide some 
adjunct therapy directional data on both efficacy and safety measures.  
A blinded interim look at the primary and secondary endpoint data may be conducted to evaluate  
the sample size assumptions .  
Additional participants  may be randomized if the variance s are larger than  the assumptions

Unless otherwise waived or addressed in another for um (eg, investigator meeting) , before  an 
investigational site can enter a participant into the study, a representative  of Sage will visit the 
investigational study site to:  
• Confirm  the adequacy of the facilities  
• Discuss with the investigator(s) and other personnel their responsibilities with regard 
to protocol adherence, IP management, GCP/ICH GCP compliance, and the 
responsibilities of Sage or its representatives. This will be documented in a Clinical 
Trial Agreement between Sage and the investigator.  
During the study, a monitor from Sage or representative will have regular contacts with the 
investigational site, for the following:  
• Provide information and support to the investigator(s)  
• Confirm that facilities remain acceptable  
• Confirm that the investigational team is adhering to the protocol, that data are being 
accurately recorded in the  eCRF s, and that IP accountability checks are being 
performed  
• Perform source data verification. This includes a comparison of the data in the CRF  
with the participant’s medical records at the hospital or practice, and other records 
relevant to the study. This will require direct access to a ll original records for each 
participant (eg, medical records, source documents,  clinic charts)  
• Record and report any protocol deviations not previously sent to Sage Therapeutics  
• Confirm AEs and SAEs have been properly documented on eCRFs and confirm any 
SAEs have been forwarded to Sage Therapeutics and those SAEs that met criteria for 
reporting have been forwarded to the IRB or IEC.  
The monitor will be available between visits if the investigator(s) or other staff needs 
information or advice.  
14.2. Audits and In spections  
Sage Therapeutics or authorized representatives of Sage Therapeutics, a regulatory authority, or 
an IRB /IEC  may visit the site to perform an audit(s) or inspection(s), including source data 
verification. The purpose of a Sage Therapeutics audit or a regulatory authority inspection is to 
systematically and independently examine all study -related activities and d ocuments to 
determine whether these activities were conducted, and data were recorded, analyzed, and 
accurately reported according to the protocol, Good Clinical Practice ( GCP )/International 
Council for Harmonisation (ICH) guidelines, and any applicable re gulatory requirements. The 
investigator should contact Sage Therapeutics immediately if contacted by a regulatory agency 
or IRB/ IEC about an inspection.

details regarding the audit process.  
The investigator must have adequate quality control practices to ensure that the study is 
performed in a manner consistent with the protocol, GCP /ICH GCP guidelines, and applicable 
regulatory requirements. The investigator is responsible for reviewing all identified protocol 
deviations. Protocol deviations that harm or increase the possibility of harm to the rights and 
welfare  of a participant  or a deviation made without prior IRB/IEC approval to eliminate an 
immediate hazard to the participant should be reported to the IRB /IEC  per the IRB /IEC ’s written 
procedures.  
The investigator is responsible for supervising any individual or party to whom the i nvestigator 
delegates study -related duties and functions conducted at the study site. When the investigator 
retains the services of any individual or party to perform study -related duties and functions, the 
investigator must ensure the individual or party is qualified to perform study -related duties and 
functions and should implement procedures to ensure the integrity of the study -related duties and 
functions performed, and any data generated.  
The investigator must maintain adequate and accurate source docu ments and study  records that 
include all pertinent observations on each of the site’s study  participants. Source data must be 
attributable, legible, contemporaneous, original, accurate, and complete. Changes to source data 
should be traceable, should not o bscure the original entry, and should be explained, if necessary 
to provide clarification.

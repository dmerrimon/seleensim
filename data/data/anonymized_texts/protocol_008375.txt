Name of Sponsor/Company: Sunovion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
Name of Investigational Product : SEP-363856 
Title of Study: A 26 -Week Open -label Safety and Tolerability Extension Study of SEP-363856 in 
Adult Subjects with Schizophrenia  
Proposed Indication : Schizo phrenia 
Study Centers:  Approximately 35 centers that have participated in Study SEP361-201  
Phase of Development: 2 
Study Objectives: 
Primary: The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the long -term safety and tolerability of 
flexibly dosed SEP -363856 (25, 50, or 75 mg/day [ie, once daily]) in adult subjects with schizophrenia 
who have completed Study SEP 361-201 by the incidence of overall adverse events (AEs), serious AE s 
(SAE s), and AEs leading to discontinuation.  
Secondary: 
•To evaluate the long- term safety and tolerability of SEP -363856 by assessing vital signs,
physical examinations (PE) , body weight and body mass index (BMI), 12- lead
electrocardiograms (ECG), clinical laboratory evaluations, and suicidal ideation and
suicidal behavior using the Columbia – Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS)
•To evaluate the long -term effectiveness of SEP -363856 using the Positive and Negative
Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total score, Clinical Global Impression -Severity (CGI -S),
PANSS subscale scores (positive, n egative, general psychopathology), Brief Negative
Systems Scale (BNSS), and Montgomery -Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS)
•To explore the long -term maintenance of response in subjects treated with SEP -363856 as
measured by the time to relapse and the rate of relapse
Other:  
•To assess whether long -term treatment with SEP -363856 is associated with extrapyramidal
symptoms as measured by the Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale (BARS), the Abnormal
Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS), and the Simpson -Angus Scale ( SAS)
•To characterize the long -term effects of SEP -363856 as measured by the Drug Effects
Questionnaire (DEQ)
•To characterize the subjective long -term effects of SEP -363856 on sleep as measured by
the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)
•To explore the effect s of SEP -363856 on cognition as assessed by the CogS tate Brief
Battery (CBB)  and the CogState Schizophrenia Battery (CSB)
•To explore the effects of SEP -363856 on func tional outcomes as measured by the UPSA -B
total score
Study Design:  
This is a 26 -week, mu ltiregional, open-label extension study designed to evaluate the long- term safety 
and tolerability of SEP-363856 for the treatment of subjects with schizophrenia who have completed 
Protocol SEP361-202, Version 34.00 SEP-363856 
Confidential and Proprietary 5 13 October 2017 the 4 -week double -blind treatment phase of Study SEP361-201. 
Subjects who m eet the entry criteria will transition immediately from Study SEP 361-201 (at Visit  7; 
assessments perf ormed at Study SEP361-201 Visit 7 will serve as the Baseline assessments for the 
present study). Informed consent will be obtained from all subjects befor e any study procedures are 
performed for the present study. 
Subjects will attend an initial visit on Day  1 (same day as Visit  7 of study SEP361-201). Subjects may 
be hospitalized for the first week of the present study, if deemed appropriate by the Investi gator. 
During the treatment period, clinic visits will occur as shown in the following figure, during which the 
procedures outlined in Table  2 will be conducted. Subjects will be seen at weekly intervals for the fir st 
4 weeks, then every 4  weeks thereafter up to week  26. Telephone calls will be made by a member of 
the clinical research staff to the subjects between scheduled study visits (between Weeks 1 and 2, and 
at Weeks 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, and 25) to monitor clinical symptoms and adverse events. If subject appears to be symptomatic, an unscheduled visit will be made as early as possible.  Subjects 
who discontinue early from the study or complete study will be required to complete the follow-up visi t 
7 days (±  2 days) post last dose of study drug. 
Study Sc
hematic 
Note: Titration up to 7 5 mg/day is permitted (but not required) on Day 4 for reasons of efficacy as an unscheduled visit.
All 
subjects will receive open -label SEP-363856 50 mg/day from D ay 1 through Day 3. Beginning on 
Day 4, flexible dosing ranging from 25 to 75 mg/day is permitted, if deemed clinically necessary (for 
reasons of safety, tolerability, or efficacy) by the Investigator. On Day  4, subjects are permitted (but 
not required) to titrate up to 75  mg/day for reasons of efficacy . Thereafter, if a dose increase is 
necessary to optimize efficacy  it should occur at regular scheduled study visits based on Investigator 
judgement. Day  4 dosing changes will occur at an unscheduled visit. T hereafter, an increase in dose 
should occur at weekly intervals in increments of one dose level at a time to a maximum dose of 75 mg/day. Dose reduction for tolerability purposes is allowed  at any time during the study. 
Safety and tolerability will be monitored throughout the study by collection of physical examination 
results, ECGs, vital signs, AEs, clinical laboratory parameters, C -SSRS, body weight, and BMI. 
Subjects who have any new significant findings or worsening of findings for suicidal ideation or behavior upon completion of the C-SSRS at any time during the study must be referred to the 
investigator for follow -up evaluation. 
Subjects who meet any discontinuation/withdrawal criteria will be terminated from the study. Upon 
termination from the study, hospitalization will be allowed for up to 7 days to stabilize the subject, if 
necessary. Prior authorization for hospitalization must be approved by the Medical Monitor. 
Effectiveness will be evaluated using the PANSS total and subscale scores, as well as CGI -S, BNSS , 
and MADRS scores.  
Subjects will provide information on subjective drug effects via administration of the DEQ. In addition, effects on movement disorders will be measured using the AIMS, BARS and SAS scales. Subjective 
effects on sleep will b e measured by the PSQI scale.  Effects on cognition will be assessed by the 
Cogstate Brief  Battery (C BB) and the CogState Schizophrenia Battery (CSB), and a functional 

Protocol SEP361-202, Version 34.00 SEP-363856 
Confidential and Proprietary 6 13 October 2017 outcome measure (UPSA -B total score).

Statistical Methods:  
The analysis of the long -term safety and tolerability, and efficacy will be based on the safety 
population, which includes all subjects who receive at least one dose of study drug during the 26- week 
OL exte nsion period.  
The primary analysis for the study is to assess the incidence of AEs, SAEs, and AEs leading to 
discontinuation. AEs, SAEs, and AEs leading to discontinuation will be summarized by the number and percentage of subjects with any AE, and AEs by system organ class and preferred term. AEs will 
be further summarized by severity and by relationship to study drug. The summary of AEs will be 
limited to those AE occurring on or after the first dose (of the 26 -week OL ex tension period) of study 
drug. 
Absolute values and changes from DB Baseline of Study SEP 361-201 and OL Baseline of Study 
SEP361-202 in clinical laboratory tests (hematology, serum chemistry, urinalysis, glucose and lipid 
panel, prolactin, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA
1c)) and in clinical ev aluations (vital signs, body 
weight, BMI, blood pressure [supine and standing], heart rate [supine and standing], 12- lead ECGs) 
will be summarized descriptively. Changes in physical examinations will also be summarized 
descriptively. The frequency and severity of suicidal ideation and suicidal behavior using the C- SSRS 
will be provided . 
Clinical response to 4  weeks of treatment with SEP-363856 is defined as meeting both of the following 
criteria: (1) a decrease in PANSS total score of ≥ 20% from baseline, and (2)  a CGI -S score ≤ 4. For 
subjects assigned to double-blind SEP-363856, clinical response will be evaluated using the Day 29 data of study SEP361-201, against the DB baseline of study SEP361-201. For subjects assigned to double-blind placebo, clinical response will be evaluated using the Day 29 data of study SEP361-202, 
against the OL baseline of study SEP 361-202. 
Relapse will be identified programmatically using the pre-defined criteria among subjects who demonstrated a clinical response to 4  weeks of treatment with SEP- 363856. The rate of relapse will be 
calculated as the proportion of subjects with a relapse in the 26 -week OL extension period, along with 
the 95% confidence interval. The time -to-relapse will be summarized descriptively and will also be 
presented by a Kaplan -Meier plot.  
Descriptive statistics will be presented  on the change in PANSS total and subscale scores, change in 
CGI-S score, change in BNSS total score, and change in MADRS  total score. Changes from DB 
Baseline of Study SEP361-201 and OL Baseline of Study SEP361-202 will be presented. The 
proportion of subjects who achieve a response, defined as a 20% or greater improvement in PANSS 
total score from the baseline, and calculated using (1) the DB Baseline of Study SEP361-201 for 
subjec ts assigned to double-blind SEP-363856,and (2) the OL Baseline of Study SEP361-202 for 
subjects assigned to double-blind placebo, will be calculated . 
Sample Size:  All subjects who complete the 4 -week double-blind treatment period of Study 
SEP361-201 are el igible  to enroll. It is anticipated that approximately 180 subjects will enter this 
open -label extension study.

c All subjects will have a safety follow -up visit 7  (± 2) days after their last dose of study drug.  
d All study drug will be taken once daily in the eve ning by mouth.  
e Telephone calls will be made by a member of the research staff to the subjects between scheduled study visits (between Weeks  1 and 2, and at Weeks  5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 
21, 23, and 25) to monitor clinical symptoms and adverse events. If subje ct appears to be symptomatic, an unscheduled visit will be made as early as possible.  
f Procedures and assessments for unscheduled visit are: drug accountability, physical and neurological examination, vital signs , ECG, clinical laboratory tests, urine dru g screen, 
PANSS, CGI -S, MADRS, BNSS, AIMS, BARS, SAS, and C -SSRS.  
g Vital signs will include supine and standing measurements of blood pressure and heart rate and respiratory rate and temperature.  
h Clinical laboratory tests include: hematology, serum chem istry, urinalysis, serum prolactin, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA 1c), and glucose and lipid panel (subjects must be 
fasted [no food or drink except water at least 8  hours] prior to collection of blood samples for glucose and lipid panel).  
i Blood samples for determination of plasma SEP-363856 and SEP-363854 concentrations  will be collected at Visit  2E, 5 E, 8E, and 11E (time and date of the 3 previous doses of 
study medication and the time of the blood sampling must be recorded). Time of food intake relative to study drug taken should be recorded.  
j Urine drug screen may be ordered at other visits as deemed clinically appropriate. These results should be discussed with the  Medical Monitor.  
k Any positive urine β -hCG test should be confirmed by a serum β -hCG te st. 
l Unscheduled BARS, AIMS, and SAS scales should be administered if a subject develops extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS ) requiring treatment. See Section  10.3.  
m Titration up to 75  mg/day is permitted (but not required) on Day  4 for reasons of efficacy  as an unscheduled visit . At the minimum Investigator will assess AEs, concomitant 
medications and perform drug accountability at Day 4 unscheduled visit, all other assessments are not required but permitted based o n Investigators judgment.  
Note : With the exception of the  DEQ and the USPA -B, all rating assessments will be performed by the rater using a tablet. In the event that a tablet is not available, the rati ng 
assessments will be performed by the rater using a paper version of the assessment.

4.1. Background  
Schizophrenia is a chronic and disabling neurodegenerative disorder characterized by a mixture 
of positive symptoms (eg, hallucinations, delusions, and thought and movement disorders), negative symptoms (eg, flat affect, anhedonia, alogia, and avolition), and cognitive deficits (eg, 
impaired memory, attention, and planning/organizing). Mood symptoms such as depression, 
anxiety, hostility, a nd excitement can also be present in patients with schizophrenia ( Patel -2007; 
NIMH -2010). Despite scientific advances, schizophrenia remains one of the most challenging 
diseases to treat due to its variable nature, the heterogeneity of clinical response, the side effects of treatment, and its association with high morbidity and mortality ( Lehman -2004; Tandon-2008; 
NIMH -2010). 
Schizophrenia has an estimated population prevalence of approximately 1% (estimated 2.4 million adults), with a diagnosed prevalence of 0.51% in the United States ( Narrow -2002; 
Wu-2006). It affects both genders equally (NIMH -2010) typically first manifesting in young 
adults, with the peak ages of onset in the early to mid 20s in men and late 20s in women (APA-2000). It is believed to be caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors 
(Minzenberg-2008). Dopaminergic, serotonergic and glutamatergic systems are believed to play 
a role in schizophrenia ( Kuroki-2008; Kim-2009).  
The current standard of care for the treatment of schizophrenia is the use of second generation antipsychotics or “atypical antipsychotics” (Lehman 2004; Kreyenbuhl-2009; NIMH -2010; 
Meltzer -2011; Nakamura -2009). These “atypicals” are thought to have fewer extrapyramidal 
side effects compared to first generation antipsychotics or “typical antipsychotics” (eg, haloperidol) ( Leucht-2009; Naber -2009 ). However some patients respond poorly to both atypical 
and typical antipsychotics and some continue to have symptoms and substantial functional/cognitive impairment ( Keefe -2006; Webber -2008 ). Very few patients return to 
Baseline (pre psychosis) function ( Schultz-1999;  Pearlson -2000; Kapur-2001). In addition, some 
atypical agents have a variety of other side effects, including weight gain, metabolic syndrome, sedation , QTc prolongation, extrapyramidal symptoms and tardive dyskinesia ( Davis -2004; 
Lieberman -2005; Newcomer -2007; Leucht 2009), which may lead to significant medical 
problems as well as contribute to poor compliance and treatment discontinuation. The large sc ale 
NIMH -CATIE schizophrenia study found that 70% to 80% of outpatients discontinue 
medications because of lack of efficacy or occurrence of side effects (Lieberman 2005) often 
leading to relapse of symptoms and need for rehospitalization ( Ascher -Svanum-2010; 
Munro-2011; Morken-2008). Clearly, an unmet need exists for new, effective, and well- tolerated 
treatments . 
4.2. Study Conduct Rationale  
SEP-363856 is a CNS-active compound, which shows broad efficacy in animal models of 
schizophrenia (positive and negative symptoms), cognition and depression. The molecular target 
responsible for the profile effects has not been completely elucidated, but may include actions at 
5 HT1A and trace amine associated 1 (TAAR1) receptors. Rat electroencephalogram (EEG) 
Protocol S EP361-202, Version4.00 SEP-363856 
Confidential and Proprietary 24 13 October 2017 studies showed that SEP-363856 suppressed rapid eye movement (REM) sleep in a dose 
dependent manner. In nonhuman primate functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) 
experiments, similar to risperidone, pretreatment with SEP -363856 also reduced the ketamine 
brain fMRI response in rhesus monkey supporting an antipsychotic- like profile. Taken together, 
these data demonstrate that SEP -363856 exhibits clear, functional CNS PD signals in rats and 
nonhuman primates. 
To date, 210 subjects have received oral doses of SEP -363856 in six Phase 1 clinical studies. 
Five Phase 1 studies have been completed (SEP361-101, SEP361-103, SEP361-105, 
SEP361-106, and SEP361-108). One Phase 1 study has been clinically completed (SEP361-104). 
The first in human clinical study, a single ascending dose study (SAD; Study SEP361-101), was designed to determine the safety, tolerability, maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and PK of a 
single oral dose of SEP-363856 in normal , healthy, adult male subjects.  
Study SEP361-103 was a randomized, double-blind, plac ebo-controlled, crossover 
polysomnography (PSG) study that investigated the e ffect of a single oral dose (50  mg and 
10 mg) of SEP -363856 on REM sleep suppression and PK in healthy adult male subjects. A 
single 50 mg oral dose of SEP-363856 suppressed REM s leep in all subjects (increased latency 
to REM sleep and reduced time spent in REM sleep) and increased NREM sleep stage 2 (N2), and NREM sleep stage 3 (N3) (deep or slow wave sleep). A single oral 10 mg dose of 
SEP-363856 also increased latency to REM sleep to a lesser extent, but did not reduce time spent 
in REM sleep. Taken together, results from these 2 studies in healthy adult male subjects 
demonstrated acceptable safety profile as well as robust CNS effect.  
Study SEP361-105 was a randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled, SAD study assessing the 
safety, tolerability, and PK of SEP-363856 in male and female subjects with schizophrenia. 
Study SEP361-106 was a 2 part, randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple 
ascending oral dose (MAD) and open- label study in male and female schizophrenic patients 
assessing the safety, tolerability, and PK of SEP-363856 in the target patient population. Results 
from this study demonstrate an acceptable safety and tolerability profile of SEP -363856 up to 
28 days in schizophrenia patients. Additionally, in Part 2, treatment with SEP -363856 at 
75 mg/day for 28  days demonstrated improvement in efficacy m easures (PANSS total score, 
CGI-S) compared with Baseline. Furthermore, ad hoc subgroup analyses showed a signi ficantly 
greater decrease from Baseline in PANSS total scores at the end of the 28 -day treatment period 
in subjects who had less frequent hospitalizations per year of illness compared with subjects who had more frequent hospitalizations per year of illness. 
Study SEP361-104 was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single dose study of the 
effects of SEP -363856 (50 mg) and amisulpride (400 mg) on BOLD- fMRI signal in healthy adult 
male and female subjects with high or low schizotype characteristics . Subjects with high 
schizotype characteristics and patients with schizophrenia share many similar features including positive, cognitive, negative and anhedonia symptoms, although in high schizotypes the features 
present in an attenuated form. In this study, fMRI was used in combination with a validated 
monetary incentive delay (MID) task to examine the single dose effects SEP -363856 on changes 
in reward processing. During the anticipation/motivational phase of the task, SEP-363856 
modulated striatum, insu la and orbitofrontal cortex brain activity, and fMRI effects of 
SEP-363856 were similar to those observed with the D2 antagonist amisulpride. During the 
outcome/hedonic phase of the task, SEP-363856 generally increased brain activity in core reward 
Protocol S EP361-202, Version4.00 SEP-363856 
Confidential and Proprietary 25 13 October 2017 areas ( striatum, insula), whereas amisulpride decreased brain activity in these same regions. 
Taken together the overall pattern of activity during MID task performance support specific 
hypotheses for the potential of SEP-363856, a novel MoA molecule, to improve positive and 
negative symptoms of schizophrenia. Overall, the known molecular pharmacology profile, animal model evidence, and clinical experience in healthy adult male and female subjects, adult 
male and female subjects with high and low schizotype characteristics, and patients with 
schizophrenia provide further support to evaluate SEP-363856 as a potential treatment for schizophrenia. 
This is an open-label extension study to further evaluate the safety and tolerability of 
flexibly -dosed SEP -363856 (25, 50 or 75 mg) over 26 weeks of treatment in adult subjects with 
schizophrenia who completed 4 weeks of double- blind treatment Study SEP 361-201. 
4.3. Risk-Benefit Assessme nt 
Overall, in previous clinical studies SEP -363856 was generally safe and well tolerated. The 
pharmacokinetic (PK) and safety profiles observed in adults from completed clinical studies support evaluation of dose levels of 25 to  75 mg /day in adults with schizophrenia. 
Schizophrenia is a life -long disorder and despite advances in drug treatment man y patients 
continue to experience symptoms with impaired quality of life. SEP -363856 has a unique 
mechanism of action and, if successful, could provide a major step forward in the treatment of 
schizophrenia. Moreover, its unique mechanism of action suggest that it has fewer side effects 
than traditional antipsychotics and, therefore, is likely to be well tolerated by subjects in this study.  
4.4. Hypothesis  
This is an open-label extension study to evaluate long- term safety and tolerability of 
SEP-363856. No stati stical hypothesis tests will be performed.

Confidential and Proprietary 29 13 October 2017 7. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
7.1. Overall Study Design  
This is a 26-week, multiregional, open- label extension study designed to evaluate the long -term 
safety and tolerability of SEP-363856 for the treatment of subjects with schizophrenia who have 
completed the 4 -week dou ble-blind treatment phase of Study SEP361-201. 
Subjects who meet the entry criteria will transition immediately from Study SEP 361-201 (at 
Visit 7; assessments performed at Study SEP 361-201 Visit 7 will serve as the Baseline 
assessments for the present stud y). Informed consent will be obtained from all subjects before 
any study procedures are performed for the present study.  
Subjects will attend an initial visit on Day  1 (same day as Visit  7 of study SEP361-201). Subjects 
may be hospitalized for the first we ek of the present study, if deemed appropriate by the 
Investigator. During the treatment period, clinic visits will occur as shown in the following 
figure, during which the procedures outlined in Table 2 will be con ducted. Subjects will be seen 
at weekly intervals for the first 4  weeks, then every 4  weeks thereafter up to week 26. Telephone 
calls will be made by a member of the clinical research staff to the subjects between scheduled study visits (between Weeks 1 an d 2, and at Weeks 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, and 25) to 
monitor clinical symptoms and adverse events. If subject appears to be symptomatic, an 
unscheduled visit will be made as early as possible. Subjects who discontinue early from the 
study or complete study will be required to complete the follow-up visit 7 days (±  2 days ) post 
last dose of study drug. 
 
Figure 1 Study Schematic  
 
Note: Titration up to 7 5 mg/day is permitted (but not required) on Day 4 for reasons of efficacy as an unscheduled visit.  
 
All subjects will receive open -label SEP-363856 50 mg/day from Day  1 through Day 3. 
Beginning on Day 4, flexible dosing ranging from 25 to 75 mg/day is permitted, if deemed 
clinically necessary (for reasons of safety, tolerability, or efficacy) by the Investigator. On Day  4, 
subjects are permitted (but not required) to titrate up to 75  mg/day  for reasons of efficacy . 
Thereafter, if a dose increase is necessary to optimize efficacy it should occur at regular scheduled study visit based on Investigator judgement. Day 4 dosing changes will occur at an 
unscheduled visit. Thereafter, an increase in dose should occur at weekly intervals in increments of one dose level at a time to a maximum dose of 75 mg/day. Dose redu ction for tolerability 
purposes is allowed at any time during the study.  

Protocol S EP361-202, Version4.00 SEP-363856 
Confidential and Proprietary 30 13 October 2017 Safety and tolerability will be monitored throughout the study by collection of physical 
examination results, ECGs, vital signs, AEs, clinical laboratory parameters, C -SSRS, body 
weig ht, and BMI. Subjects who have any new significant findings or worsening of findings for 
suicidal ideation or behavior upon completion of the C- SSRS at any time during the study must 
be referred to the investi gator for follow -up evaluation. 
Effectiveness will be evaluated using the PANSS total and subscale scores, as well as CGI -S, 
BNS S, and MADRS scores. 
Subjects will provide information on subjective drug effects via administration of the DEQ. In 
addition, effects on movement disorders will be measured using the AIMS, BARS and SAS  
scales. Subjective effects on sleep will be measured by the PSQI scale. Effects on cog nition will 
be assessed by CogState Brief Battery  (CBB) and the CogState Schizophrenia Battery ( CSB) , 
and a functional outcome measure (UPSA- B total score).  
Blood samples for determination of plasma SEP -363856 and SEP -363854 concentrations will be 
collected at Visit 2E, 5E, 8E, and 11E. POPPK  analysis will be performed using plasma 
SEP-363856 concentrations; the results of which will be reported separately.  
Subjects who meet any discontinuation/withdrawal criteria will be terminated from the study. 
Upon termination from the study, hospitalization will be allowed for up to 7 days to stabilize the 
subject, if necessary. Prior authorization for hospitalization must be approved by the Medical 
Monitor. 
7.2. Treatment Assignment and Blinding  
This is an open- label study. All subjects will receive flexible dosing with SEP-363856 (25, 50, or 
75 mg /day).  
7.2.1. Emergency Unblinding Procedures  
This is an open- label study . 
7.3. Rationale  
7.3.1. Rationale for the Study Design 
This is an open-label extension study to further evaluate the long- term safety and tolerability of 
flexibly -dosed SEP -363856 (25, 50 or 75 mg ) over 26 weeks of treatment in adult subjects with 
schizophrenia who completed 4  weeks of double- blind treatment in Study SEP361-201. 
Long -term effectiveness  of SEP-363856 will also be evaluated. 
7.3.2. Rationale for the Dosages 
In the present study, dosing of SEP -363856 at 25, 50, or 75 mg /day for 26 weeks will be utilized  
based on observed safety and tolerability in previous studies. Dosages of 50 or 75 mg /day were 
evaluated in Study SEP 361-201. Selection of this dose range was guided by the maximum 
tolerated dose (MTD) determined for single doses of SEP -363856 administered to heal thy adult 
subjects in Study SEP 361-101 (50 mg); the MTD determined for single doses administered to 
adult subjects with schizophrenia in Study SEP 361-105 (75 mg ); by the single doses 
administered to healthy adult subjects (Studies SEP361-103 and SEP 361-104 [50 mg ]) which 
Protocol S EP361-202, Version4.00 SEP-363856 
Confidential and Proprietary 31 13 October 2017 were found to have robust CNS activity). Study SEP361-108 in narcolepsy subjects  also 
demonstrated CNS activity (i.e., REM  suppression) at 25 and 50 mg . In addition, dose selection 
is supported by acceptable safety and tolerability data fro m the 7 -day (10  – 75 mg ) and open 
label 28 -day (75 mg ) MAD study (Study SEP361-106, Parts 1 and 2) in adult subjects with 
schizophrenia. 
7.4. Prevention of Missing Data  
In an effort to minimize the number of subjects who are terminated from the study prior to s tudy 
completion, the following study design and conduct elements are implemented: 
• allowance of a dose reduction (from 75 to 50 mg /day or from 50 to 25 mg /day) for drug 
tolerability purposes 
• allowance of some concomitant psychotropic medications during stud y participation  
• train the study centers on the importance of continued follow-up and on the informed 
consent process, ensuring subjects understand the commitment they are making, 
including the intent to complete the trial 
• monitor data collection for adherence during the study

10.1. Study Drug 
All study drug doses will consist of capsule(s) containing SEP -363856 administered orally.  
Subjects m ay take study drug with or without food at appr oximately the same time each evening 
before bed -time.  
Time and date of food intake must be recorded on Day 8, Day  29, Day  113, and Day  183 when 
blood samples are collected for determination of SEP -363856 and SEP -363854 concentrations. 
10.1.1. Dosage Adjustment Criteria  
All subjects will receive open -label SEP-363856 50 mg /day from Day  1 through Day 3. 
Beginning on Day  4, flexible dosing ranging from 25 – 75 mg/day is permitted , if deemed 
clinically necessary (for reasons of safety, tolerability, or efficacy) by the Investigator . On Day  4, 
subjects are permitted (but not required) to titrate up to 75  mg/day. Thereafter, if a dose increase 
is necessary to opti mize efficacy it should occur at regular scheduled study visits based on 
Investigator judgement. Day 4 dosing changes will occur at an unscheduled visit. Thereafter, an 
increase in dose should occur at weekly intervals and in increments of one dose level a t a time to 
a maximum dose of 75 mg /day. Dose reduction for tolerability purposes is allowed  at any time 
during the study. 
10.2. Treatment Compliance  
The Investigator will record the dose of the study drug and the dates of the initial and final 
administration  for each  dose. 
Compliance must be monitored closely and determined at each visit. Subjects will be instructed 
to bring all used blister cards and unused study drug with them to each visit. Compliance will be 
assessed by counting capsules and dividing the actual number of doses taken (per capsule count) 
by the number of doses the subject should have taken within a visit period and multiplying by 100. All subjects will be reminded of the importance of strict compliance with taking study 
drug for the effectiveness of treatment and for the successful outcome of the study. Subjects who miss more than 25% of scheduled doses or take more than 125% of the scheduled doses will be considered noncompliant. Evidence of noncompliance must be immediately reported to the 
Clinical Research Associate (CRA) and/or Medical Monitor.  
10.3. Concomitant Medications and Restrictions  
The following information on a ll medication  administered between  Visit 1E and Visit 11E or at 
discontinuation will be recorded on the CRF: Medication  name, dose, frequency, route,

Confidential and Proprietary 41 13 October 2017 11. STUDY ASSESSMENTS
A study schematic is presented in Figure  1. A summary of assessments to be conducted at each 
visit is  presented in Table 2. 
11.1. Demographics and Baseline Characteristics  
Demographics (date of birth, sex, ethnicity, race), height, and medical and psychiatric history 
collected at Visit 1 of Study SEP361-201 will be carried over . Prior and current medications in 
Study SEP361-201will be carried over and will also be collected  in the present study. 
11.2. Prior and Concomitant Medication Review 
See Section  10.3 for a complete description of medications permitted during the study. Site study 
staff will record all medications used to treat sch izophrenia in the eCRF. Also, the following 
parameters will be recorded for all concomitant medications: drug name, route of administration, 
total daily dose, unit, frequency, start/stop dates, indication, and whether the medication was 
started after last dose of study drug . The prior and concomitant medications will subsequently be 
coded using the World Health Organization Drug Dictionary (WHO- DD).  
11.3. Efficacy Assessments  
11.3.1. Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) 
The PANSS is an interview -based measure of the severity of psychopathology in adults with 
psychotic disorders. The measure is comprised of 30 items and 3  scales: the Positive scale 
assesses hallucinations, delusions, and related symptoms; the Negative scale assesses emotional 
withdrawal, lack of mo tivation, and similar symptoms; and the General Psychopathology scale 
addresses other symptoms such as anxiety, somatic concern, and disorientation. An anchored 
Likert scale from 1  - 7, where values of 2 and above indicate the presence of progressively mor e 
severe symptoms, is used to score each item. Individual items are then summed to determine 
scores for the 3  scales, as well as a total score. A Composite scale score (Positive scale score 
minus Negative scale score) can also be calculated to show the rel ative valence of positive and 
negative symptoms. Total time required for the PANSS interview and scoring is approximately 30 – 40 minutes ( Guy-1976, Kay-1994;  Opler -1992; Perkins-2000). PANSS raters will be 
required to meet specific training and education criteria before they are certified to rate for this study. In addition, raters will receive specific training and education regarding all of the assessments prior to study initiation.  
11.3.2. Brief Negative Symptom Scale (BNSS)  
The BNSS  is a rating scale to measur e the current level of severity of negative symptoms in 
schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder . The measure is comprised of 13 individual items  and 
5 domain scores (blunt ed affect , alogia, avolition, anhedonia, and asociality ). The 5  domain 
scores provide a summary score and the 13 individual items provide a composite total score 
(ranging from 0  to 78). Each of the items are scored  on a Likert -type 7-point scale from 0 - 6, 
where values of 0  indicates symptom is absent and a value of 6 means the symptom is a severe 
form. The number of items varies per domain. BNSS  raters will be required to meet specific 
Protocol S EP361-202, Version4.00 SEP-363856 
Confidential and Proprietary 42 13 October 2017 training and education criteria before they are certified to rate for this study. In addition, raters 
will receive specific training and education regar ding all of the assessments prior to study 
initiation.  
11.3.3. Montgomery -Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS)  
The MADRS is a clinician -rated assessment of the subject’s level of depression. The measure 
contains 10 items that measure apparent and reported sadness, inner tension, reduced sleep and 
appetite, difficulty concentrating, lassitude, inability to feel, and pessimistic and suicidal 
thoughts. Each item is scored in a range of 0 to  6 points, with higher scores indicating increased 
depressive symptoms. The Structured Interview Guide for the MADRS (SIGMA) 
(Williams -2008) will be used for the administration of the MADRS assessment. T he MADRS 
will be administered by a qualified rater at the site.  
11.3.4. Clinical Global Impressions – Severity Scale (CGI -S) 
The CGI-S is a clinician -rated assessment of the subject’s current illness state on a 7 -point scale, 
where a higher score is associated with greater illness severity. Following a clinical interview, 
the CGI-S can be completed in 1  to 2 minutes. The CGI -S will be admin istered by a qualified 
rater at the site.  
11.3.5. CogState Brief Battery (CBB) and CogState Schizophrenia Battery (CS B) 
The CBB will be completed at Visit 1E (ie, Baseline, which is the same day as Visit 7 of Study 
SEP361-201). The CBB assesses four domains. The D etection test (Attention Domain) measures 
speed of performance. The mean of the log10 transformed reaction times for correct responses 
are utilized to determine the score. Lower scores correspond to better performance. The 
Identification test (Information Processing Domain also measures speed of performance. The 
mean of the log10 transformed reaction times for correct responses are utilized to determine the 
score. Lower scores correspond to better performance. The One Card Learning test (Visual 
Learning Domain) measures accuracy of performance. Arcsine transformation of the proportion of correct responses are utilized to determine the domain score. Higher scores correspond to 
better performance. The One-back Memory test (Working Memory Domain) measures Arcsi ne 
transformation of the proportion of correct responses is  utilized to determine the domain score. 
Higher scores correspond to better performance. 
The CSB will be completed at Visit 7E (Week  12) and Visit 11E (Week  26). The CSB includes 
the four domains of the CBB and three additional domains. The Internal Shopping List (Verbal 
Learning Domain) measures the t otal number of correct responses made in remembering the list 
on three consecutive learning trials. Higher scores correspond to better performance. Groton Maze Learning (Problem Solving Domain) measures the t otal number of errors made in 
attempting to learn the same hidden pathway on five consecutive trials . Lower scores correspond 
to better performance. Social Emotional Cognition (Social Cognition Doma in) measures 
accuracy of performance. A rcsine transformation of the proportion of correct responses is 
utilized to determine the domain score. Higher scores correspond to better performance.

(USPA-B) 
University of California, San Diego, Performance- Based Skills Assessment -Brief (USPA -B) 
assesses everyday functioning in persons with serious mental illness ( Mausbach -2007). The 
UPSA -B, consists of 2 subscales (communication and fina ncial). The UPSA -Brief is a measure 
of functional capacity in which patients are asked to role-play tasks in 2 areas of functioning: 
(1) communication and (2) finances. The UPSA -Brief requires approximately 10  – 15 minutes to 
complete and will be administe red by a trained professional.  
11.4. Safety Assessments  
The Investigator or appropriate designee will review results of safety assessments on a regular 
basis and the Sponsor must be kept fully informed of any clinically significant findings either at 
baseline or subsequently during study conduct. 
11.4.1. Adverse Events  
Adverse events will be collected for each subject. Subjects should be queried in a non- leading 
manner, without specific prompting (eg, “Has there been any change in your health status since 
your last visit?”). See Section  12, Safety Reporting. 
AEs and SAEs will be monitored throughout the study at all visits. 
11.4.2. Clinical Laboratory Tests 
The clinical laboratory tests required by protocol are listed in  Section  22, Appendix III. 
Blood and urine samples will be collected for clinical laboratory tests. For detailed instructions 
regarding clinical laboratory procedures, sampling, and shipping guidelines refer to the Central 
Labor atory Instructions Manual. Samples will be processed at a central laboratory to ensure 
consistency. All clinical laboratories will be College of American Pathologists (CAP), Clinical 
Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) and/or other laboratory certific ations or 
equivalent accreditation documents. 
Any POC  (point of care) kits that are performed on site by study personnel rather than in a lab- 
must be CLIA waived and the study center  must possess a CLIA certificate of Waiver.  
11.4.3. Vital Signs  
Blood pressure and heart rate measurements will be taken in a sitting and standing position. 
Respiratory rate and temperature will also be measured and all measurements will be recorded in 
the eCRF. Clinically significant changes from the signing of the ICF should be captured as AEs in the eCRF.  
Supine systolic and diastolic blood pressures, respiratory rate, pulse rate, and oral temperature 
will be measured following 5 minutes of seated rest.  
Blood pressure and pulse rate should first be taken with the subject in the supine position after 
resting for ≥ 5 minutes. Blood pressure and pulse rate will be taken again after standing for 2 to 
4 minutes. The same arm should be used during each assessment of blood pressure and pulse rate throughout the study. If a subject develops s ymptoms consistent with orthostatic hypotension 
Protocol S EP361-202, Version4.00 SEP-363856 
Confidential and Proprietary 44 13 October 2017 (light-headedness, dizziness, or changes in sensorium upon standing) at any point, his or her 
supine and standing blood pressure and pulse rate should be collected at that time in the manner 
described above. Vital signs will be obtained prior to clinical laboratory collection and 
performance of an ECG.  
11.4.4. Electrocardiograms (E CGs) 
All ECGs will be obtained in the supine position, after the subject has been resting supine for at 
least 5 minutes. ECGs will be 12-lead with a 10-second rhythm strip. ECGs should be obtained 
prior to drawing blood samples. All attempts should be made to use the same ECG recorder for 
all visits within individ ual subjects. Refer to  Section  20 Ap pendix I for additional information. 
ECG parameters to be collected include ventricular heart rate (beats/min), QT interval (msec), PR interval (msec), QRS interval (msec) ,RR interval (msec), and overall ECG interpretation (Normal, Abnormal NCS, Abnormal CS).  
It is the responsibility of the Investigator to perform a safety review of the ECG data for changes 
from previous assessments and/or emergent cardiac dysfunction, and to determine subjects’ eligibility for or continuance in the study. Abnormalities re quire comment as NCS or CS. 
Typically, CS designated events will be reported as adverse events.  
ECGs will be reviewed, signed and dated by the Investigator  after each ECG collection. The 
same physician should review all ECG reports for a given subject whenever possible. 
The original ECG tracing will be kept with subject’s source documentation. A copy may be 
collected by the Sponsor. 
11.4.5. Physical and Neurological Examination 
Full PE as well as a neurological examination will be performed. The PE includes an assessment 
of general appearance and a review of systems (dermatologic, head, eyes, ears, nose, 
mouth/throat/neck, thyroid, lymph nodes, respiratory, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, extremities, musculoskeletal, neurol ogic, and psychiatric systems).  
The phys ical and neurological examination results at Visit 1 (screening) of Study SEP361-201 
will be carried over. All PE and neurological exam findings at screening of Study SEP361-201 will be captured in the medical history in the CRF. Any clinically significant changes from 
screening in Study SEP361-201, as determined by the Investigator, will be noted as AEs in the 
CRF.  
11.4.6. Height, Weight, and BMI 
Weight will be measured in kilograms. Weight will be measured in street clothes, without shoes 
and coat/jacket.  
Height in meters will be  carried over from study SEP361-201. Height will be measured without 
shoes. 
BMI for all visits will be derived within the Electronic Data Capture (EDC) system.  
Waist circumference will be measured in inches or centimeters and recorded in the eCRF.

Confidential and Proprietary 45 13 October 2017 11.4.7. Safety Scales  
11.4.7.1. Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) 
The AIMS is a clinician -rated assessment of abnormal movements consisting of unobtrusive 
observation of the subject at rest (with shoes removed) and several questions or instructions 
directed toward the subject. Using a severity scale ranging from 0 (none) to 4 (severe), clinicians 
rate dyskinesia in several body regions, including the facial area, extremities, and trunk. There are two items related to dental status, as well as three global i mpression items assessing overall 
severity, incapacitation, and the subject’s awareness of abnormal movements ( Guy-1976; 
Munetz-1988). The AIMS raters will be required to meet specific credential and educational criteria before they are certified to rate f or this study. The AIMS will be administered by a 
qualified rater at the site.  
11.4.7.2. Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale (BARS) 
The BARS is a rating scale geared toward assessment of neuroleptic -induced akathisia, though it 
can be used to measure akathisia associated with other drugs as well. The BARS consists of four 
items, including one item assessing objective restlessness, two items targeting subjective restlessness (awareness and related distress), and one global clinical assessment item. All items are anchored an d utilize a 4 -point scale, except for the global rating which has a 6 -point scale 
(from absence of akathisia through severe akathisia). The subjective and objective items are summed to yield a total score. The BARS can be administered in about 10 minutes (Barnes -1989; Barnes -2003). The BARS will be administered by a qualified rater at the site.  
11.4.7.3. Simpson- Angus Scale (SAS)  
The SAS is a clinician -rated assessment of neuroleptic-induced Parkinsonism consisting of 
10 items. Items are anchor -based, rated on a 5-po int scale, and address rigidity, gait 
(bradykinesia), tremor, glabellar tap, and salivation ( Siddiqui-2009; Simpson-1970). The SAS 
will be administered by a qualified rater at the site.  A modified version of the SAS will be 
utilized for this study ( SAS). 
11.4.7.4. Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale ( C-SSRS) 
The C-SSRS is a tool designed to systematically assess and track suicidal adverse events 
(suicidal behavior and suicidal ideation) throughout the trial. The strength of this suicide classification system is in  its ability to comprehensively identify suicidal events while limiting 
the over-identification of suicidal behavior. The scale takes approximately 5 minutes to 
administer. The C- SSRS will be administered by a trained rater at the site. Subjects with Type  4 
or 5 suicidal ideation during the study will be discontinued from the study and referred to a 
mental health professional ( Posner-2007). For all visits the “Since Last Visit” version of the 
C-SSRS will be used. 
11.4.7.5. Drug Effect s Questionnaire (DEQ)  
A Drug Effe cts Questionnaire designed to  assess subjective effects will be completed by the 
subject. The DEQ consist of 3 questions scored on a visual analog scale (VAS). 
Protocol S EP361-202, Version4.00 SEP-363856 
Confidential and Proprietary 46 13 October 2017 11.4.7.6. Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)  
The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) consists of 19 se lf-rated questions used to measure 
the quality and patterns of sleep in adults. It differentiates “poor” from “good” sleep quality by 
measuring seven areas (components): subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, 
habitual sleep efficiency, sl eep disturbances, use of sleeping medications, and daytime 
dysfunction over the last month ( Buysse  1989).  
11.5. Population Pharmacokinetic Assessments  
All blood samples for determination of plasma SEP-363856 and SEP-363854 concentrations will 
be obtained at the same time that other blood samples are taken whenever possible. The time and date of the 3 previous doses of study drug, date, and clock time of blood sampling must be 
recorded. Date and clock t ime of food intake must be recorded at Visit 2E, 4E, 8E, and 11E when 
blood samples are collected for determination of plasma SEP -363856 and SEP-363854 
concentrations. POPPK analysis will be performed using plasma SEP -363856 concentrations; the 
results of which will be reported separately.  The relationship between PANSS total score and 
plasma SEP -363856 exposure will be explored using population PK/pharmacodynamics (PD) 
methods, and reported separately. The impact of cytochrome (CYP) P450 CYP2D6 metabolizer 
status on SEP -363856 plasma exposure will be explored and reported separately.  See Section  23 
Appendix IV for details including instructions of processin g PK samples .

Protocol S EP361-202, Version4.00 SEP-363856 
Confidential and Proprietary 55 13 October 2017 12. SAFETY R EPORTING
12.1. Definitions 
12.1.1. Adverse Events  
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in 
humans, whether or not considered drug related . 
Untoward medical occurrences that occur between the time of signing the ICF and first drug 
administration are pre -treatment events. Those that occur after first adminis tration of study drug 
are considered AEs.  
An AE can , therefore, be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory 
finding), symptom, or disease occurring after the administration of a medicinal (investigational) 
product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal (investigational) product. AEs may include the onset of new illness and the exacerbation of pre-existing conditions. A Es will be 
collected from after first administration of study drug to the last study visit. 
The Investigator should attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, symptoms, and/or other clinical information. In such cases, the diagnosis should be documented as the AE 
and not the individual signs/symptoms. 
12.1.2. Serious Adverse Events  
A serious adverse event (SAE) is an AE that meets one or more of the following criteria:  
•Results in death.
•Is life-threatening.
•Requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization.
•Results in persistent or significant disability  or incapacity.
•Is a congenital anomaly  or birth defect.
•Is an important medical event that may jeopardize the subject  or may require a
medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.
Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive
treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions  that do
not result in inpatient hospitalization .
The term "severe" is often used to describe the severity of a specific event (as in mild, moderate, 
or severe myo cardial infarction)  (see Section  12.3); the event itself, however, may be of 
relatively minor medical significance (such as severe headache). This is not the same as 
"serious," which is based on subject /event out come or action criteria usually associated with 
events that pose a threat to a subject 's life or functioning as defined by the criteria above. 
During the study, if a subject  has a hospitalization or procedure (eg, elective surgery) that was 
scheduled befor e the study entry, ie, before informed consent for an event/condition that 
occurred before the study, the hospitalization is considered a therapeutic intervention and not the 
Protocol S EP361-202, Version4.00 SEP-363856 
Confidential and Proprietary 56 13 October 2017 result of a SAE. However, if the event/condition worsens during the study, it should be reported 
as an AE (or SAE, if the event/condition results in a serious outcome such as prolongation of 
hospitalization).  
Life-threatening means that the subject was, in the view of the Investigator, at immediate risk of 
death from the event as it occurred. This definition does not include an event that had it occurred in a more severe form might have caused death.  
SAE criteria information will be captured on the CRF. 
12.2. Objective Findings 
Clinically significant abnormal objective findings (eg, clinical laboratory value, ECG value, and 
physical examination observation) will also be recorded as  AEs. 
When a clear diagnosis is available that explains the objective findings, this diagnosis will be 
recorded as the AE, and not the abnormal objective finding (eg , viral hepatitis will be recorded as 
the AE, not transaminase elevation). If a definite diagnosis is not available, then record the sign (eg, clinically significant elevation of transaminase levels) or symptom (eg, abdominal pain) as the AE.  
Clinical laboratory test results will be reviewed by the Investigator. The Investigator must 
determine the clinical significance of all out of range values. Clinical laboratory test with possibly drug- related or clinically relevant abnormal values of uncertain causalit y may be 
repeated. Any abnormal values that persist should be followed at the discretion of the Investigator. Laboratory reports will be initialed and dated on all pages by the Investigator. 
Clinical Laboratory Tests Outside the Normal Range: Any value outside the normal range will be 
flagged for the attention of the Investigator or appropriate designee at the study center. The 
Investigator or appropriate designee will indicate whether or not the value is of clinical 
significance. If the result of any test (or repeat test, if done) from the samples taken is indicated 
as clinically significant and is not covered by the inclusion criteria in Section  8.1, the subject will 
not be allowed into the study. Additional test ing during the study may be done if medically 
indicated. If a clinically significant abnormality is found in the samples taken after dosing, 
during the study, and/or at the Follow-Up Visit, this should be recorded as an AE and the subject 
will be followed until the test(s) has (have) normalised or stabilised.  
All on -site ECG tracings and ECG over -read reports will be reviewed by the Investigator. The 
Investigator must determine the clinical significance of all abnormal ECG s. ECG with possibly 
drug- related or clinically relevant abnormal findings of uncertain causality  may be repeated . Any 
abnormal ECGs that persist should be followed at the discretion of the Investigator. ECG 
tracings will be initialed and dated on all pages by the Investigator. 
12.3. Collection and Recording of Adverse Events  
All pre -treatment events and AEs must be recorded in the subject’s study records/source 
documents in accordance with the Investigat or’s normal clinical practice. All pre -treatment 
events and AEs/all AEs must be recorded on the CRF.  
All AEs will be followed until resolution, stabilization of the condition, the event is otherwise 
explained, or the subject is lost to follow-up. 
Protocol S EP361-202, Version4.00 SEP-363856 
Confidential and Proprietary 57 13 October 2017 Each AE is to be evaluated for duration, severity , frequency , seriousness,  action taken with the 
study treatment, outcome, and causal relationship to the s tudy treatment. Definitions for severity , 
frequency , action taken with the study treatment, outcome, and causal relationship to the s tudy 
treatment  are presented below.  
The severity  of AE:  
•Mild  - Ordinari ly transient symptoms that do not influence performance of subject’s
daily activities. Other t reatment is not ordinarily indicated.
•Moderate - Marked symptoms sufficient to make the subject uncomfortable.
Moderate influence on performance of subject’s dail y activities. Other treatment may
be necessary.
•Severe - Symptoms cause considerable discomfort. Substantial influence on subject’sdaily activities. May be unable to continue the s tudy, and other treatment may be
necessary.
The frequency  of AE : 
•Once – an isolated episode.
•Intermittent  – occurs on two or more separate occasions.
•Continuous  – does not abate from date of onset to date of resolution.
The action taken  with the s tudy treatment: 
•Drug Interrupted  – Study drug stopped temporarily.
•Drug Withdrawn  – Study drug stopped permanently.
•Dose Reduced.
•Dose Increased.
•Dose Not Changed.
•Not Applicable.
•Unknown
The outcome of the AE: 
•Recovered/Resolved
•Recovering/Resolving
•Not Recovered/Not Resolved
•Recovered/Resolved with Sequelae
•Fatal
•Unknown
The causal relat ionship of the AE to the s tudy treatment: 
•Not related
Protocol S EP361-202, Version4.00 SEP-363856 
Confidential and Proprietary 58 13 October 2017 oNot related  - Improbable temporal relationship and is plausibly related to
other drugs or underlying disease.
•Related
oPossible  - occurred in a reasonable time after study drug administration, but
could be related to concurrent drugs or underlying disease.
oProbable  - occurred in a reasonable time after study drug administration, is
unlikely to be attributable to concurrent drugs or underlying disease, and there
is a plausible mechanism to implicate the study drug.
oDefinite  - occurred in a reasonable time after study drug administration and
cannot be explained by concurrent drugs or underlying disease. The adverseevent should respond to dechallenge/rechallenge, however, this is not
mandatory before assigning a definite causality.
The Medical Monitor is the initial contact person for protocol related questions or discussion of 
AEs. The contact information for the Medical Monitor as well as other emergency contact 
information can be found in Table 1 of this protocol. 
12.4. Immediately Reportable Events  
The following medical events must be immediately reported to  the Sponsor: 
•SAE
•Pregnancy
Emergency contact information can be found in T able 1. 
12.4.1. Serious Adverse Event  
If the Investigator or study center  staff becomes aware of a SAE that occurs in a study subject 
after first administration of study drug through 30 days following the last dose of the s tudy drug, 
this must be reported immediately to  the Sponsor whether considered related or unrelated to the 
study drug. SAEs must be recorded on the CRF and the data recorded should agree with that on 
the SAE form.  
Following the end of subject participation in the s tudy, the Investigator or an authorized delegate 
should report SAEs “spontaneously” to PPD -PVG if considered at least possibly related to the 
study drug.  
SAEs will be followed until resolution, loss to follow-up, stabilization of condition, or the event is otherwise explained.  
In additi on to the initial telephone notification, a n initial SAE form as applicable must be 
completed and signed and sent via fax or email  (see Table 1 ) to PPD -PVG within 24 hours of the 
Investigator or s tudy center staff b ecoming aware of the event.  The SAE form must be signed by 
the Investigator or appropriate designee. PPD -PVG provides the SAE form used to report SAEs. 
The Sponsor or designee will promptly notify all study centers and Investigators of a SAE that is 
determ ined to be expedited to the Regulatory Authorities in accordance with  applicable law (s) 
and regulation(s ). These SAEs must be promptly reported to the Institutional Review Board 
Protocol S EP361-202, Version4.00 SEP-363856 
Confidential and Proprietary 59 13 October 2017 (IRB) or Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) by the Investigator or the appropr iate person at 
the study center if required per IRB/IEC guidelines . 
For the UK, the appropriate Pharmacovigilance (PVG) group must be contacted immediately 
upon first knowledge of the incident. The immediate report should be made by the Investigator within  a very short period of time and under no circumstances should this exceed 24 hours 
following knowledge of the serious adverse event or pregnancy. 
12.4.2. Pregnancy  
Pregnancies  that occur from the time th at informed consent is signed through 90 days following 
the last dose of the s tudy drug will be collected and reported on the Pregnancy Event Form. 
If a subject  becomes pregnant during the course of the study, she will be instructed to commence 
discontinuation of the study drug. Further, t he subject (or female partner of male subject) will be 
instructed to return promptly/within 48 hours of the first notification of pregnancy to the study 
center  and undergo a serum/urine pregnancy test, as confirmation of pregnancy. If positive, the 
female pregnant subject will no longer receive any additional study drug . All pregnancies, 
whether or not the subject received any additional study drug , will be followed until resolution 
(ie, termination [voluntary or spontaneous] or birth). 
To report a pregnancy, the Pregnancy Event Form must be completed and sent via fax to 
PPD-PVG within  24 hours of the Investigator or s tudy center staff becoming aware of the 
pregnancy. The Sponsor provides the Pregnancy Event Form. If the subject received blinded study drug, unblinding of the study dr ug will be offered to the 
subject when knowledge of such treatment may have an impact on further treatment decisions. 
Otherwise, information regarding to what treatment the subject was assigned may be provided 
when the study has ended. 
Pregnancy itself is not regarded as an AE unless there is a suspicion that the study drug may have 
interfered with the effectiveness of a contraceptive medication  or other AEs were detected .

Confidential and Proprietary 60 13 October 2017 13. TERMINATION OF SUBJECT FROM
STUDY/DISCONTINUATION OF STUDY DRUG
13.1. Criteria for Subject Termination/Study Drug Discontinuation  
Subjects may be discontinued from the study drug at any time for any of the following reasons: 
•Adverse event  (specify)
•Lack of efficacy (specify)
•Withdrawal by subject (specify)
•Non-compliance with study drug (specify )
•Protocol deviation (specify)
•Death
•Progressive disease
•Pregnancy
•Other (specify)
If at any time during the course of the study, in the opinion of the Investigator, the subject may 
no longer safely participate due to a change in medical status (eg, experiences an AE, becomes 
pregnant), the subject must be discontinued from the study drug. Subjects discontinued from 
study drug will be discontinued from the study. 
The reason and information on the epoch for study drug discontinuation will be recorded on the 
appropriate CRF. In case of death, the date of death should be captured on the CRF. 
13.2. Clinical Assessments after Study Drug Discontinuation  
Subjects who have not received study drug will not be followed up on leaving the study. For subjects who have received  study drug and prematurely discontinue from the study treatment 
(i.e., do not complete through Visit 11E), every effort should be made to complete the final 
evaluation procedures, in accordance with the early termination (ET) visit described in 
Section  11.6.9. 
All subjects who discontinue from the study early will complete a follow up visit 7  (±2) days 
after th e last visit to assess any post  study discontinuation adverse effects as described in  
Section  11.6.10. 
Protocol S EP361-202, Version4.00 SEP-363856 
Confidential and Proprietary 61 13 October 2017 14. STUDY TERMINATION
The Sponsor reserves the right to discontinue the s tudy at this study center or at multiple centers  
for safety  or administrative reasons at any time  while safeguarding that early termination doe s 
not compromise subjects’ safety or well- being . In particular, a study center that does not recruit 
at an acceptable rate may be closed . Should the study be terminated and/or the study center 
closed for whatever  reason, all documentation and study drugs pertaining to the study must be 
returned to the Sponsor or its representative.  
If, in the opinion of the Investigator, clinical observations suggest it may be unsafe to continue, 
the Investigator may terminate part or the entire study after consultation with the Sponsor. 
In the event of s tudy or site termination, subjects will undergo final evaluation procedures, in 
accordance with the early termination (ET) visit described in Section  11.6.9 and safety follow-up 
visit as described in Section  11.6.10. 
Protocol S EP361-202, Version4.00 SEP-363856 
Confidential and Proprietary 62 13 October 2017 15. STATISTICS
15.1. Sample Size 
All subjects who complete the 4 -week double- blind treatment period of Study SEP361-201 are 
eligible. It is anticipated that approximately 180  subjects will enter this open -label extension 
study.  
15.2. Analysis Population  
15.2.1. Safety Population 
The safety population will consist of all subjects who receive at least one dose of study drug 
during the 26- week  open-l abel extension  period. The safety population will be used for the 
long- term safety, tolerability, and efficacy analyses . 
15.3. Data Analysis 
15.3.1. Subject Disposition  
Subject  disposition will be summarized and presented for the num ber and percentage of subjects , 
who entered the extension study , received at least one dose of the extension study treatment, and 
completed or discontinued the study (including reasons for discontinuation).  
15.3.2. Drug Exposure and Compliance  
Drug exposure and compliance during the open- label extension  period will be summarized for 
the safety population.  
Exposure (in days) wil l be calculated as: last extension study dose date - first extension study 
dose date + 1. Exposure will be summarized both as a continuous variable (i.e. mean days) and 
categorically :  
•Number and percentage of subjects with extens ion study drug exposure ≥ 1, ≥ 7, ≥ 14,
≥ 28, ≥ 56, ≥ 84, ≥ 112, ≥ 140, ≥ 168, and ≥ 182 days ;
•Number and percentage of subjects with extension study drug exposure for 1 - 6,
7 - 13, 14 - 27, 28 - 55, 56  - 83, 84 - 111, 112 - 139, 140 - 167, 168 - 181, and
≥ 182 days
Percent com pliance will be calculated as: (number of capsules  taken / number of capsules  should 
have been taken ) × 100%. Percent compliance will be calculated by visit and overall for the 
entire open -label extension period, and will be summarized both as a continuous variable (ie,  
mean percentage)  and categorically (i.e. number and percentage of subjects in each compliance 
category: non-compliant < 75%, 75% - 125%, non- compliant > 125%, and missing compliance). 
Mean  daily dose will be calculated for the entire open -label extension period as the cumulative 
dose (mg) of SEP -363856 divided by the duration of exposure (in days), where cumulative dose 
is the sum of all doses a subject received during the open- label extension period. Modal daily 
Protocol S EP361-202, Version4.00 SEP-363856 
Confidential and Proprietary 63 13 October 2017 dose will be determined as the daily dose that is taken for the most time (in terms of number of 
days)  among all doses taken . Both mean  daily dose and modal daily dose will be summarized.  
15.3.3. Important Protocol Deviations 
Important protocol deviations (IPDs) will be identified and documented based on a review of 
potentially IPDs. The potentially IPDs will be identified through programmatic checks of s tudy 
data, as well as through review of selected data listings. The potentially IPDs to be reviewed 
include, but are not limited to, subjects who: 
•Did not meet inclusion/exclusion criteria  for the open-label extension study.
•Received any disallowed concomitant medication  during the open- label extension
period.
Individual IPDs will be presented in a data listing. The number and percentage of subjects with 
IPDs will be summarized for the safety population by the type of deviation. 
15.3.4. Demographic and Baseline Characteristics  
Demographic and baseline characteristics data will be summarized for the safety population. 
Selected data (e.g. PANSS total scor e, CGI -S score, etc. ) will be summarized  at both the 
double-blind ( DB) baseline of study SEP361-201 and the open- label (OL) baseline of 
study SEP 361-202. 
Medical history will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA)  
version 18.1 or higher, and will be summarized for the safety population by presenting the 
number and percentage of subjects with at least one condition in each system organ class  (SOC) 
and preferred term  (PT). 
15.3.5. Efficacy Analyses 
Efficacy data will be summarized descriptively for the safety population. 
The absolute values of PANSS total score and subscale scores (positive, negative, and general 
psychopathology), CGI-S score, BNSS total score, and MADRS total score at both the DB baseline of study SEP361-201 and OL baseline of study SEP361-202, and at each scheduled 
post-baseline extension visit, wi ll be summarized descriptively.  
Changes from baseline in the above efficacy measures will be summarized at each scheduled 
post-baseline extension visit, based on both the DB baseline of study SEP361-201 and the OL 
baseline of study SEP361-202. 
PANSS total score and CGI -S score data will also be separately summarized by age group, 
gender, race, and geographic region (i.e. US sites vs. non-US sites). Additional subgroup factor s 
and details of the subgroup analysis will be provided in SAP. The proportion of subjects who achieve a response, defined as a 20% or greater improvement (i.e. 
decrease) in PANSS total score from the baseline at the end of the 26 -week open -label extension  
period, will be calculated based on: (1) the DB baseline of study SEP361-201 for subjects assigned to double-blind SEP-363856, and (2) the OL baseline of study SEP361-202 for subjects 
Protocol S EP361-202, Version4.00 SEP-363856 
Confidential and Proprietary 64 13 October 2017 assigned to double-blind placebo. For subjects who discontinue early, t he PANSS total score 
measured at the early termination visit will be used.  
The CBB composite score at the DB baseline of study SEP361-201 and OL baseline of study 
SEP361-202 will be calculated. The composite score based on the four domains contained in the CBB scale (i.e. attention, information processing, visual learning, and working memory) will be 
calculated from the CSB assessment result at Visit 7E (Week  12) and Visit 11E (Week  26) of 
study SE P361-202. The composite score of CSB at Visits 7E and 11E wi ll also be calculated.  
The absolute values of CBB composite score at the DB baseline of study SEP361-201 and the OL baseline of study SEP361-202, and the four- domain composite score at each scheduled 
post- baseline extension visit, will be summarized descr iptively. Changes from baseline in 
four-domain composite score will be summarized at each scheduled post- baseline extension visit, 
based on both the DB baseline of study SEP361-201 and the OL baseline of study SEP361-202. 
In addition, the absolute values of CSB composite score at Visits  7E and 11E of study 
SEP361-202 will be summarized. Change from Visit 7E in CSB composite score at Visit 11E 
will also be summarized.  
The absolute values of UPSA- B total score at the OL baseline of study SEP361 -202, and at ea ch 
scheduled post- baseline extension visit, will be summarized descriptively. Changes from the OL 
baseline in UPSA -B total score will be summarized at each scheduled post -baseline extension 
visit.  
15.3.6. Safety Analyses 
15.3.6.1. Adverse Events  
All AEs will be coded using Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA)  
version 18.1 or hi gher. AEs are untoward medical occurrences: 
•that occurred on or after the first dose of study drug,
•with a missing start date and a stop date on or after the first dose of study drug, or
•with both a missing start and stop date.
For the present  study the summary of AEs will be limited to those tha t occurred on or after the 
first dose (of the 26-week open- label extension period) of the study drug. 
AEs will be summarized by MedDRA system o rgan class  (SOC) and Preferred Term (PT).  
The following AEs wil l be summarized and presented by MedDRA SOC and PT for the Safety  
population: 
•All AEs (including number of events and subject incidence).
•AEs by severity (mild, moderate, severe).
•AEs by relati onship to the study treatment (related, or not related).
The following conventions will be followed in summarizing AEs: 
•For subject incidence summaries, each subject will be counted only once within eachSOC and within each preferred term.

the AE with the highest known severity within each body system and within each
preferred term will be include d in the summaries by severity.
•For summaries by relationship to the study drug , AEs will be grouped as “related” or
“not related.” AEs assessed as “possible,” “probable,” or “definite,” will be grouped
as “related.” If a subject reports more than one AE within the same treatment
regimen, SOC and PT, and any are related, it will be s ummarized as related.
Summaries of SAEs and AEs leading to discontinuation will also be provided. A listing of AEs, 
as well as a listing of death s, SAEs , or AEs leading to discontinuation, will be presented. 
15.3.6.2. Clinical Laboratory Assessments

DB baseline of study SEP361-201 and the OL baseline of study SEP361- 202 will be  used  in the 
calculation  of change values . For laboratory parameters with categorical outcomes, the number 
and percentage of subjects with each outcome will be presented. The data listings will flag values 
outside the reference range.  
15.3.6.3. ECGs 
Absolute values and changes from Baseline in ECG parameters will be summarized. In addition, 
the number and percentage of subjects with elevated QTc intervals (> 450 msec, > 480 msec, and 
> 500 msec) and changes from baseline in QTc intervals ≥ 30 msec and ≥ 60 msec will be 
summarized. Fridericia’s correction (QTcF) and Bazett’s correction (QTcB) will be used for QT interval correction.  Both the DB baseline of study SEP361-201 and the OL baseline of study

Frequency and severity of suicidal ideation and suicida l behavior as measured by the C-SSRS 
scale will be summarized for each visit.  
15.3.6.8. Rate of Relapse and Time to Relapse 
The relapse will be assessed in subjects who demonstrated clinical response to 4  weeks of 
treatment with SEP -363856. Clinical response is defined as meeting both of the following 
criteria : 
1) a decrease in PANSS total score of ≥ 20% from baseline, and2)a CGI -S score ≤ 4.
For subjects assigned to double-blind SEP -363856, clinical response will be evaluated using the 
Day 29 data of study SEP361-201, against the DB baseline of study SEP361-201. For subjects 
assigned to double-blind placebo, clinical response will be evaluated using the Day 29 data of 
study SEP 361-202, against the OL baseline of study SEP361-202. 
Relapse will be identified programmatically using the pre- defined criteria ( Section  6.2) among 
subjects who demonstrated a clinical response to 4 weeks of treatment with SEP -363856. The 
rate of relapse will be calculated as the proportion of subjects wi th a relapse in the 26- week 
open-label extension period out of all subjects who demonstrated clinical response, along with 
the 95% confidence interval. The time- to-relapse will be summarized descriptively and will also 
be presented by a Kaplan -Meier plot .

16.1. Data Collection/ Electronic Data Capture (EDC)  
The results from data collected during the study (except clinical laboratory test results)  will be 
recorded in the subject’s  electronic CRF.  Data will be entered into source documents prior to 
being transcribed into the CRF. This transcribing will be done once a subject has been enrolled at  
baseline (Visit 1E) . Data for screen failures will not be collected. The study centers will use an 
EDC system that is compliant with relevant FDA regulatory requirements per  21 code of federal 
regulations (CFR) Part  11. Password protected access to the EDC system will be via a secure 
website. Data queries and data corrections will be handled through the same system. All 
transactions within the EDC system are fully documented within an electronic  audit trail. Each 
set of completed CRFs must be reviewed and electronically signed and dated by the Investigator 
or delegate.

Confidential and Proprietary 78 13 October 2017 20. APPENDIX I. CARDIAC SAFETY M ONITORING  (ECG) 
1. Requirements for Testing  
Electrocardiogram ( ECG ) equipment and supplies will be provided by the centralized cardiac 
safety v endor and should be used for all in -clinic protocol ECG assessments.  
• All 12-lead ECGs will be recorded in the same manner.  
• The study center  personnel must be adequately trained in performing ECGs on the 
specific ECG equipment used in this protocol that is provide d by the cardiac safety 
vendor. 
• To the extent possible, the same ECG machine and personnel should be used to 
acquire a subject’s ECGs throughout the period of their participation in the s tudy.  
• ECGs will be recorded with at least one 10 -second single- lead tracing record ed from 
Lead II.  
2. Subject Restrictions and Instructions  
• Prior to ECG acquisition, the subject will have rested 10 minutes in the supine position and will remain so until the ECG is obtained. 
3. Reporting  
• It is the responsibility of the Investigator to perform a safety review of the ECG data 
for changes from previous assessments and/or emergent cardiac dysfunction, and to determine subjects’ eligibility or continuance in the study.  
• ECGs will be reviewed, signed and dated by the Investigator listed on the Form 
FDA 1572 (MD or DO) after each ECG collection. The same Investigator should 
review all ECG reports for a given subject whenever possible. 
• For all ECGs, a report will be provided by the cardiac safety vendor to the study 
center  for review and signature. 
• The E CG tracing will be kept with subject’s source documentation and / or CRF 
unless it is specified otherwise. The original ECG and the cardiologist’ s over -read 
will be retained at the study center . 
4. Data Standardization 
ECG data will be transmitted to a centra lized cardiac safety vendor and centrally over -read 
and interpreted using standardized procedures. 
 
Protocol S EP361-202, Version4.00 SEP-363856 
Confidential and Proprietary 79 13 October 2017 21. APPENDIX II . HIGHLY EFFECTIVE CONTRACEPTIVE  
PROCEDURES  FOR AND DURING THE STUDY 
For female subjects  
Female subject of reproductive potential agrees to remai n abstinent or use highly effective 
and reliable contraception throughout the study and for at least 30 days after the last dose of 
study drug has been taken. In the Investigator's judgment, the subject will adhere to this 
requirement.  
a. Highly effective  contraception is defined as continuous use of either two barrier 
methods (eg, condom and spermicide or diaphragm with spermicide) or a hormonal 
contraceptive. Highly effective hormonal contraceptives include the following:  
i) contraceptive implant (such as Norplant®) implanted at least 90  days prior to 
screening;  
ii) injectable contraception (such as medroxyprogesterone acetate injection) given 
at least 14  days prior to screening; or  
iii)  oral contraception taken as directed for at least 30  days prior to screening. 
b. Subjects who are of non-reproductive potential, ie, subject who is surgically sterile, 
has undergone tubal ligation, or is postmenopausal (defined as at least 12 months of 
spontaneous amenorrhea or between 6 and 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea with follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) concentrations within postmenopausal range as determined by laboratory analysis  based on study SEP361-201) are not required to 
remain abstinent or use highly effective contraception. 
For Male Subjects  
Male subjects with female partner(s) of childbearing potential must agree to avoid fathering a 
child and use highly effective  methods of birth control from screening until at least 30 days 
after the last study drug administration . Male subjects must be surgically sterile or willin g to 
use an effective method of double-barrier birth control as outlined for female subjects above.

Confidential and Proprietary 81 13 October 2017 23. APPENDIX IV. PHARMACOKINETIC SAMPLING  AND 
SAMPLE  HANDLING  GUIDELINE   
 
Please refer to the Laboratory Investigator Manual for all collection a nd shipping instructions. 
 
When blood sample for PK assessment and clinical lab sample collections share the same 
designated time points (including predose sample), the blood samples should be collected during 
the same venipuncture. 
For each defined PK sa mpling time point, collect 6  mL blood sample into a K2- EDTA treated 
tube. Invert gently 8 to  10 times. Keep the blood collection tube on wet ice, and centrifuge for 
20 minutes at ca.  x 1300 g to isolate plasma within 30  minutes of blood draw. To ensure a m ore 
homogenous sample, all plasma samples should first be transferred to 1 tube, capped and mixed 
well. Split the harvest plasma sample with approximately equal volume into 2  polypropylene 
tubes, and label as Primary and Back -up. Freeze plasma tubes in a freezer at 
approximately -20°C or lower. The date and clock time of blood collection must be recorded. 
Blood must be collected from all subjects at the time points indicated below.  
All samples will be shipped with sufficient dry ice protection.

SUBJECT 'S NAME: 
TITLE OF RESEARCH PROTOCOL : Pecto -Intercostal Fascial Block for 
Postoperative Ana lgesia after Cardiac Surgery: A Pilot Study

CCI Form: 6-2017 
PI Revision Date :   07/09/2018   
Currently, pain after surgery is treated by pain-reducing medications  called opioids that you receive 
through  a vein in your arm .  Administration of  opioids may lead to a number of adverse events like 
nausea, vomiting, sedation, decreased bowel activity, and more severe complications such as issues 
with your lungs and breathing.   
 
A regional analgesic block  (an injection of pain medicine b etween the shoulder and rib muscles ) has 
been shown to reduce pain after breast or chest trauma surgeries.  The anesthetic bupivacaine  (study 
medication ) has been Food and Drug Administration  (FDA) approved for blocks and is wid ely used .  
The efficacy of using a n analgesic block to reduce pain and opioid use after cardiac surgery has not 
been studied in enough people yet .   
 
In this study we want to determine whether use of a regional analgesic block  with bupivacaine can 
help reduce the chest  pain you m ay experience following heart surgery.  
 
STUDY PARTICIPANTS  
You have been asked to be in the study because  you are undergoing heart surgery. Approximately 80 
patients will participate in this study at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical C enter.  
 
DESCRIPTION OF STUDY DETAILS  
If you agree to be in this study, you will be asked to read and sign this consent form.  After you sign the 
consent form, the following things will happen:  
 
1. Screening Procedures :  Screening procedures are tests and proc edures that will be done to 
determine if you are eligible to take part in the research study.  For this research study, the 
screening procedures include:   
 
We will review o f your  medical records  to ensure that you are appropriate to participate in the 
study and that you don’ t not have any sensitivities  to the study medication .  
 
2. Randomization Procedures:   It is not clear at this time whether the medication  used in this  
study would affect your pain after cardiac surgery .  For this reason, the treatment plan  
offered to you will be picked by chance [like the flip of a coin].  You will not be able to choose 
which treatment you receive.  The chances of receiving either of the treatments are 
approximately equal. After the randomization, you will be assigned to on e of the following 
groups:  
 
 Group 1: Bupivacaine  
  
 Group 2: Placebo ( Salt water )

SUBJECT 'S NAME:

Postoperative Ana lgesia after Cardiac Surgery: A Pilot Study  
PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR 'S NAME: Balachundhar Subramaniam, MD

Informed Consent – Part D  
CCI Form: 6-2017 
PI Revision Date :   07/09/2018   
Depending upon the group to which you are assigned, you may receive a placebo instead of 
the study medication .  A placebo is an inactive saline solution  that looks like the study drug, 
but a placebo contains no active medication.  Placebos are used to help determine if the 
results of the study are truly from the study drug.  Neither you nor your physician will  know 
whether you will be receiving the study drug or the placebo .  However this information can be  
learned in case of an emergency.  
 
It is important to note that this study medication will be given in addition to  the regular pain 
medications you might receive after cardiac surgery.     
 
3. Research Procedures :  If you quali fy to take part in this research study, you will undergo 
these research procedures:  
 
A) Administration of the Study Medication : As part of your participation, we will be 
administering the study medication at two different time periods: 1) shortly after your 
surgery  when you are first in the intensive care unit, and 2) one day after your surgery . 
The study medication  or placebo  will be administered by a trained anesthesiologist.   
 
At each time point you  will be given a total of 2 0 cc or about two  tablespoons of study 
medication  injection on each side of your sternum  (chest) . Ultrasound will be used to 
guide the injection and confirm it is in the appropriate place between the shoulder and 
rib muscles.   
 
B) Short Daily assessment : We will ask you a few thinking an d memory questions each 
day while you are in the hospital. This will take about 3 -5 minutes.  
 
C) Data Collection  from your Medical Record : We will be accessing your medical 
records in order to obtain information on how you are doing. Specifically we will be 
looking at the pain medications administered and your reported pain scores.   This 
data is routinely collected by nurses as part of your stay in the hospital  after surgery .   
 
Other aspects of your surgery  and care after surgery will occur as they normally  would 
if you had decided not to participate in the study.   
 
4. Monitoring/Follow -Up Procedures .  Procedures performed to evaluate the effectiveness and 
safety of the research procedures are called “monitoring” or “follow -up” procedures.  For this 
research s tudy, the monitoring/follow -up procedures include:  
 
We will monitor you for four days  after surgery to see how you are doing . To do this w e will 
review your medical  records and speak with your doctors and nurses  as necessary .

RISKS AND DISCOMFORTS  
As a r esult of your participation in this study, you are at risk for side effects listed in this section.  
You should discuss these with the investigator and with your regular doctor if you choose.    
 
Ultrasound is a very safe technology, and has no additional r isks associated with it.  The risks of 
bupivacaine  include:  
 
More Common  [>5% occurrence]  
 Constipation , nausea , vomiting  
 
Less Common  [>1% but <5% occurrence]  
 Abnormal nervous system function such as excitation, depression, numbness, tingling 
sensation, se izures, drowsiness, unconsciousness . 
 Abnormal heart functions including abnormal rhythm, decreased heart rate, decreased 
blood pressure, or heart block   
 
Rare  [<1% occurrence]  
 Allergic reactions including hives, itching, redness, swelling, coughing, sneezi ng and 
breathing difficulty  
 Persistent numbness, tingling and weakness at the site of administration  
 
There is also a minor risk of hematoma  (a bruise or  collection of blood  under the skin ) associated 
with the administration of any block; however use of ul trasound to guide administration of the block 
lessens the possibility of this risk.   
 
LOSS OF CONFIDENTIALITY  
There is the potential for loss of confidentiality by participating in this study.  Every effort will be 
made to protect the confidentiality of y our identifiable information.   
 
CONFIDENTIALITY  
Information learned from your participation in this study and from your medical record may be 
reviewed and photocopied by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and/or other federal and 
state regulatory agen cies, and the Committee on Clinical Investigations , the Human Subjects 
Protection Office and others involved in research administration of the Beth Israel Deaconess 
Medical Center with protection of confidentiality so far as permitted by applicable law.  I nformation 
resulting from this study and from your  medical record  may be used for research purposes and may 
be published; however, you will not be identified by name in such publications.

 2.0 INTRODUCTION AND LITERATURE REVIEW  
2.1 Introduction  
Nasal airway obstruction affects the upper airway system causing restriction in normal airflow into 
the nasal cavity.  This nasal condition can be caused by a diversity of mucosal and structural 
disorders in the nasal cavity.  Nasal  diseases such as acute  and/or chronic  rhinosinu sitis can cause 
nasal polyps, turbinate hypertrophy and other soft tissue responses.  Structural anomalies such as 
severe septal deviation, nasal valve angle changes or nasal valve collapse are among the 
dysfunctions that are common causes of nasal obstruc tion (Udaka, Suzuki et al. 2006, Wittkopf, 
Wittkopf et al. 2008, Chandra, Patadia et al. 2009, Fraser and Kelly 2009) .  
 
Chronic nasal obstruction can elicit  many  symptoms, including congestion, stuffiness, headache, 
fatigu e, sleep disturbance, daytime sleepiness, snoring and a decline in health -related quality of life 
(QOL) (Rhee, Book et al. 2003).   In recent years, there has been growing awareness t hat nasal 
obstruction may impair various daily and social activities  (Udaka, Suzuki et al. 2006)  and result in a 
degradation of the patient’s overall quality of life (Rhee, Weaver et al. 2010) .  
 
2.2 Nasal Anatomy  
The nose is a respiratory organ that performs a prominent airflow regulatory role.  Air enters the 
nasal cavity, where it  is warmed to a temperature of ap proximately 31° C to 34 °C, regardless of 
outside temperature.  The nose  also humidifies the inspired air to  a relative humidity of 90% to 95% 
(Behrbohm 2004) .  These func tions prevent drying of the distal airways, which allows optimal gas 
exchange, and helps maintain healthy body temperature.  
 The nasal anatomy is illustrated in Figure 1.  The nasal valve area (V) represents the narrowest 
segment of the nasal airway.   It is defined as the area bounded by the caudal end of the upper 
lateral cartilage (ULC), cartilagi nous nasal septum  (S) and head of the inferior turbinate  (T) (Cole 
2003, Wexler and Davidson 2004, Weaver 2012) .  The nasal valve, which is a por tion of the nasal 
valve area, is the area of highest airway resistance  in the nasal passage .  A decrease in the cross -
section of this area leads to restriction of airflow and can cause nasal obstruction symptoms.

 The nasal valve angle is the angle between the upper lat eral cartilage and the nasal septum.  
Anatomical studies have shown that this angle classically ranges between 10° and 15° in the nose 
of Caucasian  individu als.  One of the most common causes of nasal obstruction is internal nasal 
valve dysfunction wherein the upper lateral cartilage moves towards the septum, increasing airway 
resistance upon inspiration (Cole 2003, Wexler and Davidson 2004) .  
 
 3.0 NASAL VALVE OBSTRUCTION  MEASUREMENT AND TREATMENT  
3.1 Physical Assessment  
Self-diagnosis is common with patients experiencing decreased nasal airflow.  The first -line 
treatment may be o ver-the-counter remedies such as nasal dilator sprays, humidifiers and/or 
external nasal dilator strips  (e.g., “Breathe Right” nasal strips)  which temporarily expand the 
sidewalls of the nose at the level of the nasal valve.  As these temporary solutions fail to resolve chronic nasal airway obstruction, patients may then seek  professional diagnosis from an  
otorhinolaryngology ( ENT) specialist.  
   The physician will typically conduct a  history of nasal obstruction symptoms and assessment of 
nasal pathology to rule out concomitant causes of nasal obstruction and to understand prior otorhinolaryngologic  treatment and surgical history.  Common causes of chronic decreased airway 
flow can be a response from year -round allergic and non -allergic triggers, chronic sinusitis and/or 
abnormal nasal pathology such as severe deviated septum, enlarged inferior turbi nates, nasal 
polyps, etc.  As each of these factors is ruled out and the nasal valve angle is determined to be the 
likely cause of nasal obstruction symptoms, conservative measures are discussed prior to surgical 
treatment (Jessen and Malm 1 997).   
 3.2 Nasal Obstruction Measurement  
Patients presenting with decreased airway flow with suspicion of nasal valve angle changes or compromise may be evaluated by the Cottle Maneuver to understand the direct cause of nasal airway obstruction.  This maneuver temporarily enlarges the radius of the nasal valve area 
increas ing nasal airflow as the nasal valve area  is manually widened.  A positive response can be 
an indicator that patients will respond well to a  nasal valve angle increase (Kern and Wang 1993) . 
 Figure 2 demonstrates the Cottle Maneuver in which the physician temporarily lifts  and lateralizes 
the skin around the nose  and cheek, increasing the nasal valve angle .

Nasal valve  collap se may occur during inspiration.  The modified Cottle M aneuver is effective in 
diagnosis.  A fine instrument, such as a cerumen loop, is placed gently within the nares against the 
lateral nasal wall at the level of maximal observable collapse.  The patient is then asked to breathe 
in through the nose.  Collapse is stented by the instrument, which should be held lightly to prevent 
distortion.  This maneuver may predict the potential benefit of surgical nasal valve correction  
(Constantinides, Adamson et al. 1996) .  The procedure is performed both before and after 
decongestion to determine the effect of mucosal swelling in sympto mato logy.  
 
3.3 Subje ctive Assessment  
A validated disease -specific health status instrument may be used by clinicians to measure the 
outcome of subjects treated for nasal obstruction.  One well -known and recognized tool is the Nasal 
Obstruction Symptom Evaluation ( NOSE ) Scale,  which  is a validated 5 -item instrument using a 5 -
point Likert Scale (Stewart, Witsell et al. 2004).  This outcome assessment has been used to 
measure improvements in quality of life ( QOL ) following  septoplasty, functional septorhinoplasty 
and nasal v alve surgery (Dolan 2010, Chambers, Horstkotte et al. 2015, Yeung, Hassouneh et al. 
2015, Camacho, Zaghi et al. 2016) .   
 
3.4 Current Treatments  
Nasal Valve Dilators  
Multiple devices available on the market are designe d to increase the size of the nasal passage at 
the nasal valve area.   These products target people with poor nasal breathing, snoring difficulties or 
increased nasal breathing demands (e.g., athletes ).  Adhesive external nasal dilator strips are 
applied to the skin of the nose by gently folding the strip to contour to the external nasal shape at 
the level of the nasal valve.  Flexible poly ester springs within the strip recoil outward from the bent 
position .  Because the strip is firmly adhere d to the skin, the recoil gener ates a force on the external 
nasal valve causing it to open.  These devices have been found to dilate the nasal airway 
significantly there by reducing airway resistance , and  stiffen ed the l ateral nasal wall preventing 
inspiratory collapse  (Kirkness, Wheatley et al. 2000, Peltonen, Vento et al. 2004) .  
 
Roith mann and Chapnik  (Roithmann, Chapnik et al. 1998)  found that 33 patients with nasal 
obstruction, compared with 51 healthy  controls, had significant increase in airway patency with the 
adhesive external nasal dilator strip.  All sub jects showed objective mea sures of increased patency 
and experienced subjective improvement in sensation of airflow.  
 
Another available product is the  Nozovent ™ nasal alar dilator.  This consists of a semicircle of 
plastic with flattened free edges.  The semicircle is squeezed and introduced into the nasal cavity 
with the flat free e dges lying against the nasal wall  at the level of the nasal valve.  As the plastic 
ring is rele ased it recoils outward, exert ing a lateral force on the internal nasal valve, thereby 
expanding it. Although it is not as well tolerated, increased nasal patency and decreased resistance similar to (and occasionally better than) th e external adhesive strips have been found  (Ellegard 
2006) .  While effective, nasal valve dilating devices require significant patient compliance.  
 
Surgical Therapy  
Typical surgical treatments are alar batten grafts, spreader grafts, and splay grafts, all involving implantation of a cartilage graft (typically harvested from the nasal septum or ear) or a biocompatible material (Khosh, Jen et al. 2004, Fischer and Gubisch 2006, Spielmann, White et al.

 2009) .  Suturing techniques (suspension sutures, flaring sutures) are also used alone or in 
conjunction with g rafts.   
 
Another surgical treatment is a absorbable nasal implant, LATERA®, which is used to support 
upper and lower lateral cartilage in the nose, reinforcing the nasal wall like traditional cartilage and 
polymer grafts.  
 Surgical procedures are efficac ious, but can be associated with long recovery periods and 
complications such as intranasal adhesions, scarring, infection, and graft migration, resorption or 
extrusion (Rhee, Arganbright et al. 2008, Sufyan, Ziebarth et al. 2012, Cheng, Atfeh et al. 2014) .   
 
 
4.0 CURRENT USE OF RADIOFREQUENCY ENERGY IN THE NOSE   
Radiofrequency energy has been used for decades in the fields of otorhinolaryngology, neur osurgery , 
cardiology, urology and general surgery.  
 
ENT surgeons currently use radiofrequency energy daily in numerous nasal therapies.  Radiofrequency 
turbinate reduction (RFTR), for ins tance, is a minimally invasive surgical option that can reduce tissue 
volume in a precise, targeted manner.  This technique uses radiofrequency energy to create heat within 
the submucosal tissue of the turbinate, reducing tissue volume with minimal  impact on surrounding 
tissues (Coste, Yona et al. 2001) .  Radiofrequency turbinate reduction differs fundamentally from 
traditional surgical methods by using low -power radiofrequency energy to provide a  relatively quick and 
painless procedure for tissue coagulation  and/or ablation.   
 There have been multiple studies analyzing the safety and outcomes of using radiofrequency energy in 
the RFTR  procedure.  In 2009, Hytonen,  et al . (Hytonen, Back et al. 2009)  completed a systematic 
literature review of the R FTR technique and concluded that the technique is well tolerated and effective.  
 
Numerous studies have demonstrated that radiofrequency tissue therapy in the nasal passage can be 
safe and effective in improving nasal obstruction and in preserving nasal function  (Sapci, Sahin et al. 
2003) .  Kezirian  (Kezirian, Powell et al. 2005)  reported 1 minor complication of crusting in 89  adult 
patients treated with radiofrequency ablation  of the turbinates.  The same  authors also reported no 
moderate or major complications after RF turbinate reduction based on a review of  published literature 
results .  
  5.0 PRIOR INVESTIGATIONS  
Aerin Medical has identified a patient population whose nasal obstruction is primarily due to internal nasal 
valve dysfunction, rather than hypertrophied turbinates.  A weakened upper lateral cartilage (ULC) can 
collapse or protrude into the nasal airway, causing restriction of airflow through the nasal valve area.  
Figure 3 illustrates a ULC that is protruding slightly into the nasal airway.

Figure 3.  Internal Nasal Valve Dysfunction  
(from Stupak 2011, Figure 3A)  
 
It is known that a small change in nasal airway diameter can result in significant changes in airflow; this 
has been well -described by Bloching with reference to Poiseuille’s law (Bloching 2007).  Thus, even a 
slight narrowing or collapse of the ULC (as illustrated in Figure 3 and Figure 4) can result in symptoms of 
nasal obstruction.  Since c urrent non -surgical treatments, such as adhesive external nasal dilator strips 
and nasal alar dilators, provide relief only while the dev ice is being used , and surgical treatments are not 
likely to be considered by p atients unless their condition is severe and/or they desire cosmetic revision as 
well (Dolan 2010) , there is an unmet need for a non -surgical method of strengthening, shaping and/or 
supporting an incompetent ULC.   
 Several researchers have shown through in vitro  testing that radiofrequency heating can be used to 
reshape cartilage (Keefe, Rasouli et al. 2003, Manuel, Foulad et al. 2010, Zemek, Protsenko et al. 2012) .  
Targeted radiofrequency heating of the lateral cartilaginous nasal wall, with the intent of causing tissue 
retraction and volume reduction, has also been used in patients with inspiratory nasal valve collapse (Seren 2009) .   
 
Prospective, Non Randomized Multicenter  Study  – Pivotal Trial  
 
Aerin Medical conducted a prospective, non-randomized, multicenter 26-week trial in September 2016 at 
8 study centers in the United States with the primary objective to evaluate safety and efficacy of the 
Vivaer® ARC Stylus for treating the nasal valve area to improve the symptoms in those diag nosed with 
nasal airway breathing.  Fifty subjects participated in the study.  Subjects exhibited significant symptoms 
of nasal obstruction attributed to internal nasal valve dysfunction.  The nasal valve was determined to be the primary or significant con tributor to subjects’ nasal obstruction based on clinical presentation, physical 
examination, and nasal endoscopy.  Subjects were required to have a nasal obstruction symptom 
evaluation (NOSE) score ≥60 to be included in the study.    
 
 
The Vivaer® ARC  Stylus was used to apply lateral pressure to a weakened ULC, repositioning the tissue 
while heating it and thereby widening the nasal airway (see Figure 5).  Contraction of the treated area 
during the healing process would serve to curve the treated portion of the ULC, creating a wider nasal 
airway and a stiffer nasal valve wall ( Figure 6).

Of the 50 subjects enrolled in the study, 49 underwent the procedure on both nostrils and 1 subject had 
the procedure on one nostril only.  Forty -nine subjects were available for the primary analysis at the 26 -
week evaluation.  One subject was unavailable for the 26 -week evaluation 
 Safety was evaluated by  nasal status assessment, including both a physical assessment and an 
endoscopic visual assessment of the target nasal valve area within each nostril was done at baseline, immediately prior to and after the procedure, and at each subsequent follow -up visit . Other safety 
measures were a post procedure pain assessment using a visual analog scale (VAS) and monitoring of 
medications.  
There were no deaths in the study.  There were 36 adverse events reported from 20 subjects.  None of 
the events were considered r elated to the device, although 13 were considered related to the procedure.  
Most events occurred in the period from the procedure to 4 weeks.  Two serious adverse events were reported from 2 subjects.  Neither was related to the device or procedure.  Ther e were no unanticipated 
adverse events and no adverse device effects.   
 
Primary efficacy measure and the primary efficacy endpoint was the mean NOSE score change from 
baseline at the 26 -week evaluation.  The secondary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of treatment 
responders at 26 weeks, where responders were defined as subjects with at least a 15 -point decrease in 
the NOSE score.  NOSE scores were also collected at each follow -up evaluation.  Other efficacy 
measures included alternatively defined measu res of treatment responder and a patient reported 
satisfaction questionnaire collected at the 26 -week evaluation .  The mean NOSE score at baseline was 
79.9 (SD 0.8) and all subjects had nasal obstruction categorized as either severe (46%) or extreme 
(54%).  The mean NOSE score improved to 24.7 (SD 20.4) at the 26 -week endpoint with a mean change 
from baseline of 54.8 (SD 21.9).  This improvement represented a successful outcome for the primary efficacy endpoint as the null hypothesis was rejected and as the mean improvement exceeded 15 points 
on the NOSE score (paired t -test, p<0.0001, lower 95% confidence bound=49.6). At 26 weeks, severe 
and extreme nasal obstruction rates had decreased from 100% to 10% of the subjects.  
 Ninety -six percent of subjects were t reatment responders at 4 weeks and 100% at 12 weeks.  At the 26 -
week secondary endpoint there were 3 non -responders. The 94% 26- week responder rate demonstrated 
success for this endpoint by being significantly greater than the success definition of a 55% r esponder 
rate.

 Subject opinion of the procedure was generally favorable. The mean score response on a 10 -point scale 
to each of the 5 satisfaction survey questions ranged from 7.3 to 8.7, where a higher score indicates a 
more favorable response.  
 Long Ter m Follow Up Study  
 An ongoing follow up study after the prospective, nonrandomized, multicenter 26-week (pivotal) trial was 
performed to continue to follow subjects for 2 years after the primary treatment.  The objective of the 
study was to evaluate the long-term durability of benefits associated  with the treatment procedure using 
the Vivaer® ARC Stylus for nasal airway obstruction .  The Nasal  Obstruction Symptoms Evaluation 
(NOSE) survey and a Quality of Life survey developed  by Aerin Medical were admini stered at 12, 18, and 
24 months after the subjects  treatment procedure to subjects who agreed to participate and provided 
informed consent for the  long-term data collection. Subjects completed the NOSE and Aerin Medical 
Quality of  Life surveys in person wi th a study representative, by telephone, or by mail- in response.  
 
Of the original 50 patients in  the pivotal trial, 49 were eligible to participate in the long -term follow -up 
study and 39  enrolled in the study. Subjects from all original pivotal study sites were enrolled.  
 
The mean NOSE score at baseline was 80.8 (SD 10.7) for subjects participating in this  study. All subjects 
had nasal obstruction at baseline categorized as either severe (46%) or  extreme (54%). The mean NOSE 
score for subjects i n this study had significantly  improved (p<0.001) to 24.9 (SD 21.3) at the 26 -week 
endpoint of the pivotal  study with a  mean change from baseline of 55.9 (SD 23.6). Significant 
improvement (p<0.001) in mean NOSE score was maintained through the 12 -, 18-, and 24- month 
evaluations (27.5, 32.7,  and 26.5, respectively). At 26 weeks, severe and extreme nasal obstruction rates 
had decreased from 100% to 10% (4 of 39) of subjects, and at 12 -, 18-, and 24 -months, 17%,  
26% and 17% of subjects had severe or extreme n asal obstruction, respectively.  
 Using the definition of responder of at least a 15 -point  improvement in NOSE score, 92% of subjects 
participating in this study were classified as  responders at 26 weeks and at 12 months 94% were 
classified as responders (3  subjects  were not evaluated at 12 months). There were 3 participating 
subjects classified as non-responders at 26 weeks who met responder status at 12 months and 2 
subjects classified  as responders at 26 weeks who became non -responders at 12 months. All 39 subjects 
were  evaluated at 18 months with a responder rate of 87% and at 24 months 36 of 39 subjects  
were evaluated and had a responder rate of 97% . 
 
Both the improvement in NOSE score and responder rate through 24 months continued to  meet the 
success criteria established for the 26 -week endpoint of the pivotal s tudy.  Participants in the study also 
responded favorably to the Aerin Medical Quality of Life  survey showing improvement in areas such as 
sleep quality, energy and productivity, wellbeing  and emotions, less sickness, and less frequent use of 
medication compared to prior  to having the procedure. 
 Treatment for symptoms of nasal obstruction attributed to internal nasal valve dysfunction  with the Aerin 
Medical Vivaer
® Stylus was demonstrated to provide durable relief through  24 months as determined by 
maintenance of improvement in the NOSE score mean and  responder rate similar to those achieved at 26 
weeks. Response to the Aerin Medical  Quality of Life survey provided ad ditional support for the durability 
and benefits of the treatment.

 6.0 STUDY RATIONALE  
Given the significant QOL impact of nasal obstruction, it is important to measure not only the physical 
symptoms (congestion, obstruction and ability to breathe) but also the impact of those symptoms on the 
patient’s ability to sleep and the related consequences on rest, productivity, concentration and ability to 
participate in the normal daily activities of work and life.  
 In addition to the physical benefits of increased nasal patency, there are significant quality of life benefits 
that are associated with better breathing.  After correcting nasal obstruction patients report significantly 
better sleep function (e.g. better night’s sleep; waking up during the night and diff iculty falling asleep) as 
well as better psychological function (e.g. concentration, productivity and frustration).  (Brown, Hopkins, 
et. al).  We believe that these benefits may well be durable beyond the initial six months of the study in terms of sustai ned quality of life impact.  
 
The purpose of this study is to continue to evaluate additional subjects for treatment with the Vivaer
® ARC 
Stylus  for up to 36 months post-procedure.  
 
 
7.0 SUMMARY DEVICE DESCRIPTION  
The System is comprised of the Vivaer® ARC Stylus (Figure 7, Figure 8) which is a disposable handheld 
device capable of delivering bipolar radiofrequency energy to tissue, and the Aerin Console, a FDA 
cleared generator (K 162810) with temperature control capable of de livering very low doses of energy 
(Figure 9).  The Aerin Console  with the Vivaer® ARC Stylus (Figure 9) make up the Vivaer® System.   
 
The Vivaer ® ARC Stylus  is a cleared device (K172529) and  consists of a handle, shaft and treatment tip.  
An array of bipolar electrodes is positioned on a non -conductive tip which is attached to a handle via a 
non-conductive shaft.  A temperature sensor is located on the tip to monitor tissue temperature.   The 
Stylus is attached to a temperature -controlled ra diofrequency generator 	via a flexible cable.   The Vivaer® 
ARC Stylus temporarily inserted into the nose to access the treated area. It modifies the soft tissues of 
the nasal airway through the use of low doses of radiofrequency energy.  The low -power radiofrequency 
generates heat within the submucosal tissue, creating a localized  lesion.  As the lesion heals, the tissue 
retracts and stiffens.  This decreases the nasal airflow resistance thereby improving inflow of air through 
the nose.  
 
The procedure requires local anesthesia only.   The Stylus is manufactured and supplied by Aerin Medical  
and may be used to treat both nostrils of the patient.

 The investigator or designated staff will review all aspects of the study with the patient including the 
protocol, associated documents, and the follow -up process. Once the study has been explained and any 
questions have been answered the patient will complete and sign the Informed Consent Form (ICF).   
 The initial consent process as well as re -consent, when required, may take place in person or remotely 
(e.g., via telephone or other remote platforms such as video conferencing used in compliance with site 
policy ) per the discretion of the investigator and with the agreement of the subject /consen t designee . 
Whether in person or remote, the privacy and confidentiality of the subject will be maintained. The person 
explaining  consent  (and subject /consent designee, when in person) will be located in a private area (e.g., 
clinic consult room).  
 When consent is conducted remotely, the subject /consent designee will be informed of the private nature 
of the discuss ion and will be encouraged to relocate to a more private setting if needed. The subject 
should be informed of approximately how long the process will take and what information will be presented. The subject  and person explaining  consent  will view individua l copies of the approved consent 
document on screens at their respective locations; the same screen may be used when both the person 
explaining  consent and the subject  are co- located but this is not required. When remote, c onsent will be 
documented with required signatures on the electronic document. When an electronic document with a 
digital signature is used for the documentation of consent, this study will use the Adobe Acrobat platform, 
which is 21 CFR Part 11 compliant  to obtain the required signatures.  The identity of the subject  will be 
determined by a prompt, which will require the provision of information from an official identification 
document  and to answer security questions , prior to obtaining the signature. An e lectronic signature wit h 
a timestamp will be provided by the required parties through system prompts.  Both the person explaining  
informed consent  and the subject  must  sign the electronic document .  
 Whether the consent is obtained from the subject in person or remotely, the cons ent process must 
provide sufficient opportunity for the subject to consider whether to participate and to ask questions . A 
copy (paper or electronic) of the signed and dated consent must be provided to the subject.  
 
 
9.2 PHASE 2: VIVAER
® TREATMENT

the treatment date .   
 
Study subjects will be asked to complete the following self -reported questionnaires:  
 
• NOSE Score  
• Quality of Life (QOL) Questionnaire  
 
If any changes in medication, health status or subject received another nasal procedure, the subject will be instructed to contact the study staff.   
 9.5 PHASE 5:  STUDY EXIT  
Subjects will be determined exited from the study when they complete the questionnaires for each required follow up or are determined as exited if a circumstance removes them for a specific reason earlier than planned.  Subjects meeting the study requirements as planned will be exited from the 
study a fter the 36 month  follow -up data collection .  If a subject reaches the 36 month  follow -up point  
and is experiencing new or  ongoing adverse event, the study sponsor and treating investigator 
should be contacted to discuss the need and/or methods for continued surveillance of the event .  
 Subjects that  completed the 24 -month follow -up and exited per protocol version D will be invited  to 
continue participation in the study through their 36 month post Vivaer procedure date. Subjects who 
elect to continue with the study will be asked to re -consent for their participation through 36 months.  
Subjects that decline 36-month follow -up participation  or re- consent,  will be exited from the study 
after their 24 month follow -up data collection. Reasons for declining participation in the 36 month 
extension will be recorded in the eCRF.

 Visual Assessment of Treatment Area  (Nasal Evaluation):   The treated area within each nostril 
will be visually assessed.   The use of an endosc ope for visual assessment is required.   For 
consistency in reporting across sites, a study CRF will outline specific observations to be 
assessed.   In addition, representative still photographs of each nostril will be captured at each visit 	 
 
The following assessments will be obtained from the study subjects . 
 Nasal Obstruction Severity Effectiveness (NOSE) Scale :  A validated disease specific health 
status instrument to measure the outcome of subjects treated for nasal obstruction is a well -known 
and recognized validated 5- item instrument using a 5 -point Likert Scale for patients with nasal 
obstruction.  This outco me assessment has been used to measure improvements in QOL in 
septoplasty, functional septorhinoplasty and nasal valve surgery.  
 
Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for Pain Intensity : The Pain VAS will be used to rate pain associated 
with the treatment  (Hawker, Mi an et al. 2011).   Subjects will be asked to mark their pain level on a 
10 cm line anchored by verbal descriptors: 0 = no pain and 10 = worst pain imaginable.   The study 
staff will measure with a metric ruler from the 0, the beginning of the line, to the ve rtical mark made 
by the subject.   The result, expressed in millimeters, will represent the subject’s VAS Pain Score.
 
 Adverse Event Evaluation : Subjects will be asked about any side effects or adverse experiences 
related to the Vivaer
® treatment that they may have been experienced. All device related events will 
be documented on the proper Adverse Event Log and Adverse Event data form.  
 Medications :  Updates to current medications or any new or changed medications will be asked.  
The m edication log will be updated to reflect any changes.  In addition, any medications as a result 
of intervention related to the study treatment will be documented and will correlate with the Adverse Event Case Report Form.  
 Quality of Life Questionnaire :  Study-Specific Quality of Life (QOL) Questionnaire – The QOL 
questionnaire will be used to gain  better  understanding of the impact of nasal obstruction  on the 
subject’s daily activities, feelings, symptoms and medication use.

10.0 ADVERSE EVENTS  AND PRODUCT COMPLAINTS  
10.1  Adverse Events  
Adverse events (AEs) may occur during the treatment phase or during the follow -up 
phase.   Adverse events occurring after the baseline assessment but before the treatment 
procedure will be documented in the subject’s medical record but will not count as related to the study device or procedure.    
Each adverse event will be recorded in the corresponding subject’s CRF.  Each adverse event will 
be judged by the I nvestigator as to its relationship and level of relatedness to the study device 
and/or study procedure.   In addition, the Investigator will identify the date of onset, severity and 
duration of the AE.   All adverse events will be monitored until they are ad equately resolved or 
explained.   If a subject reaches the 36 month  follow -up visit and is experiencing a new or ongoing 
adverse event, the study sponsor should be contacted to discuss the need and/or methods for continued surveillance of the event.  
The Inv estigator must submit to the Sponsor a report of any Serious Adverse Event (SAE), Serious 
Adverse Device Effect (SADE) or Unanticipated Adverse Device Effect (UADE)  within 24 hours  of 
knowledge of the event.

 12.0 RISK- BENEFIT S 
12.1 Potential Risks to Patient Confidentiality  
Risks to patient confidentiality are minimized by o nly allowing authorized individuals to access the 
EDC system, which is 21  CFR Part 11 compliant.   The validated system maintains an audit trail on 
all entries, changes or corrections to eCRFs. If a person only authorized to complete eCRFs makes 
changes to an already signed eCRF, the investigator will be required to resign the eCRF, thereby protecting the integrity of the data collection process and the data.    
 The electronically driven subject reported questionnaire system enables subject privacy protection and full data attribution through th e use of a unique username, password and provides a full audit 
trail. The system employs Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) for data  in transit, at rest and in 
system backups.  The data collection process uses encryption with, a t least, 256 -bit Secure Sockets 
Layer (SSL) and 2048 bit RSA public keys  while providing the subject a user -friendly method to 
provide patient reported outcomes ( PRO )’s.  
 
12.2 Minimization of Anticipated Risks 
Risks associated with the Vivaer
® ARC Stylus are minimized by design.  In addition, risks will be 
minimized through the use of a treating physician with a high degree of experience in nasal surgical 
and minimally invasive procedures.  The treating physician  will have receive d new customer  
training in proper use of the device prior to study start.     
12.3 Potential Benefits 
Potential benefit, associated with the Vivaer® treatment, is to offer a safe, minimally invasive 
treatment method to alleviate the symptoms of nasal obstruction.  The Vivaer® ARC Stylus 
improves nasal breathing by modifying the tissues of the nasal airway using low doses of 
radiofrequency energy. The low -power radiofrequency energy generates heat within the tissue and 
creates a coagulation lesion.  As the lesion heals, the tissue retracts and stiffens, thereby 
decreasing nasal airway obstruction and improving airflow.  
 
13.0 STUDY MANAGEMENT

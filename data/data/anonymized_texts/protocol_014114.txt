4 1.0 Introduction  
The 2011 FDA Final Rule [1]  describes the procedures for determining the static sun 
protection factor (SPF )of over -the-counter (OTC) sunscreen product s. 
 
The static SPF is defined as the ratio of the minimal erythema dose of ultraviolet (UV) 
radiation for sunscreen -protected skin to that for unprotected skin.  The minimal 
erythema dose (MED) is the lowest dose of UV radiation that produces the first 
perceptible erythem a with clearly defined borders (covering more than 50%  
of the exposure site ), 16 to 24 hours  (hrs) after UV exposure  administration.  UV 
radiation doses, expressed in Joules/ square meter (J/m2), are administered using a 
xenon arc lamp that simulates solar radiation  and satisfies the requirements of the FDA 
Final Rule [1].  
 
 
2.0 Objective 
The objective of this study is  to determine  the static SPF of three sunscreen  products 
using the methodology described in the  FDA Final Rule (2011) [1]. 
 
 
3.0 Test Product s 
Three sunscreen lip balms will be evaluated ; each has a target SPF of 15 . 
• ChapStick Lip Moisturizer Original ( ; cocoa butter fragrance)  
• ChapStick Lip Moisturizer Mint Flavour ( ) 
• ChapStick Lip Moisturizer Black Cherry Flavour  ( )  
 An SPF  Standard  (7% Padimate -O and 3% Oxybenzone) will  be evaluated  alongside 
the three test products . 
 
4.0 Study Design/Blinding  
Test treatments  (SPF standard, test products  and unprotected sites) will be  randomized 
to test sites  to ensure  blinded evaluation of erythemal response . Eligible participants 
will be assigned to treatment based on the randomization schedule  on Day 1 of the 
study . 
   
To maintain study blind ing and avoid bias, the erythema  evaluator  will not participate 
in either product application or the administration of UV doses. T reatment  application  
and UV irradiation will be carried out by different individuals on the study team.  
 Each participant will have up to 8  test sites  delineated on the skin of their back . One 
will be used on Day 1 to determine MEDuI . Assignment of the three test products , SPF 
standard and an  unprotected site ( MEDuR) to test site  shall follow the  randomization 
schedule generated by  according to SOP . If the back of a participant

5 cannot accommodate  a minimum of 6 sites (too small, unsuitable areas of anatomical 
curvature), the participant will be discontinued.  
 
Note:  A minimum of  6 test site s is required to evaluate MEDuI, MEDuR, the  3 test 
products  and the SPF standard sunscreen. Up to 8 test sites will be  drawn to provide an 
additional 2 sites should test product reapplication be necessary due to uneven/  
inconsistent application to help ensure  UV exposures can be completed for all study 
treatments. 
 
For practical reasons, the only site that may  be known to the erythema evaluator is the 
Initial Unprotected MED (MEDu I) site.  If the evaluator has questions about test site 
locations and/or exposure site locations, the evaluator may receive assist ance from the 
technician s who applied the test materials and administered the UV doses; the 
technician s should not influence the evaluator in the grading of UV responses.  
 Study duration is expected to be 3- 8 days.  
 
5.0 Participants  
Potential study participants will be recruited from  Volunteer Database per SOPs 
. 
 
The FDA Final Rule (2011) [1] requires the test panel to produce a minimum of 10 valid 
test results  for each product  tested; invalid data from a maximum of 3 participants  per 
product may be rejected  (i.e., 10–13 participants  and ≥ 10 valid results  per product ). 
Therefore, a  maximum of 23 participants will be enrolled in order to achieve the  
minimum of 10 valid results per study product required for SPF labeling [1].  
 Study participants will be healthy male and female volunteers with skin types I, II or 
III (Table 1: Fitzpatrick Skin Types ). Individual Typology Angle (ITA°) will be measured 
for each participant to determine  skin type.  No discrimination  of any kind  (e.g. social 
class, gender, skin color, ethnicity) should preclude eligible participants from 
participating in the study.

A participant may be discontinued or withdraw from study participation at any time if 
the participant or the PI  (or designee ) feels it is not in the ir best interest to continue.  
The following is a list of possible  reasons for study discontinuation . 
 
• Participant develops a condition listed in the exclusion criteria  or hypersensitivity , or 
takes a contra- indicated medication/treatment. 
• Non-compliance with the requirements of the protocol.  
• Failure to follow site staff instructions.  
• Failure to attend  scheduled study visits. 
• Adverse event  (AE) that, in the opinion of the PI , means it would be in the 
participant’s best interest to discontinue study participation.  
• Protocol violation requiring documentation of deviation.  
• Sponsor request for early termination of study.  
 Participants are free to withdraw from study participation at any time, for any reason, 
specified or unspecified, and without prejudice. Reasonable attempts will be made by 
the PI, or designee , to ascertain the  reason for withdrawal. This will be recorded  in 
source document ation and included in the f inal report.  
 5.5 Disposition of Withdrawn Pa
 rticipant s  
The date a participant is withdrawn from the study  and the reason for discontinuation 
will be recorded in source documentation. If a participant fails to return for scheduled 
study  visits, the PI , or designee,  will make every reasonable effort to contact the 
participant and determine why the y failed to attend . This information will be recorded  
in source documentation. When a participant is withdraw n (regardless of reason), the 
PI, or designee,  will encourage the participant to return to site to complete all 
evaluations which may be necessary to assure that the participant is free of untoward 
effects, and to seek appropriate follow -up for any unresol ved AEs . 
 5.6 Participant R
 eplacement  
If participants are discontinued from the study or have their data rejected because 
results are considered invalid (see Section 9.0), additional participants can be 
randomized up to a maximum of 20 randomized participants per test product, until the 
maximum number of invalid data sets (3 per test product) is reached.  Any valid data collected up to that point will continue to be used.

7.1 Day 1  
7.1.1 Enrollment  
7.1.1.1 Informed Consent  Process 
Written informed consent will be obtained from each potential partici pant prior to 
entering the study  (Informed Consent of Human Subjects, 21 CFR Part 50, Subpart B ). 
The PI will ensure  the informed consent process is  conducted in accordance with 
applicable local, state, and federal laws and regulations.  
 Prospective participants  will report to the study site  and be provided with a copy of  the 
Informed Consent  Form (ICF), with Privacy Ru le 45 CFR parts 160 and 164 (details  the 
Federal protection for the privacy of health information) , a Photo Release Form and an 
annual  HIPAA authorization form to review. Site staff will answer any questions they 
may have  about the study . If they chose to participate, site staff will obtain the 
applicable signatures on the enrollment documentation,  starting with the ICF.  Site staff 
will then complete  a Medical History/Eligibility  Questionnaire  with the participant and 
document any concomita nt medications/treatments  (year of birth, but not full date of 
birth, may be recorded in source documentation) . Enrollment procedures will be 
completed  in a private setting. Each participant will be given a signed copy of the 
Informed Consent Form. If the participant has questions about their rights, they may 
contact the IRB at any time during or after trial participation.  
 If required, site staff may consult the study physician/dermatologist regarding the 
participant ’s medications/treatments and /or responses to the  medical history/eligibility 
questionnaire to confirm qualification.  
 Participants  deemed eligible based on  inclusion/exclusion criteria will continue to the  
screening skin evaluation.  Ineligibl e participants  will be discontinued.  
 7.1.1.2 ITA/Skin type determination  
The skin of the participant’s back, between the beltline and shoulder blades, will be 
examined for uneven skin tones and blemishes using a Woods Lamp. All participant s 
will acclimate at room temperature ( as described in SOP )  for 10 mins prior to 
the skin  being examined.  ITA° will then be determined by a study technician ; mean L 
*, a*, b* values will be calculated from at least 3 measurements on the back of each 
participant .  An ITA° calculation range greater than a 10 -point difference will result in 
disqualification (example: 34.6° -45.4°).

standard  to its assigned test site  using a finger cot. A double -weighing procedure 
(weighing the syringe/pipette + product + fingercot, prior to and after application) to 
ensure the required quantity of SPF  standard is delivered. Using the fingercot and light 
press ure, the SPF standard  will be  evenly spread over the test site ; spreading time will 
be 35 ± 15 secs, depending on the ease of application . 
 7.2.2.2 Test Product Application  
The study technician will apply 80 ± 2 mg (2.0mg/cm2 ± 0.05 mg/cm2) of the test 
product to its’ assigned test site  using a fingercot. A  double -weighing procedure 
(weighing boat  + product + fingercot, prior to and after application ) to ensure the 
required quantity of product  is delivered. Using the fingercot and light pre ssure, the 
test product  will be  evenly spread over the test site; spreading  time will be 35 ± 15 
secs, depending on the ease of application.  7.2.2.3 Add
 itional Application Instruction s for All Test Materials  
• The study technician will ensure t est materials are  homogenous ( thoroughly 
mixed and/or shaken well ) prior to application  
• Test sites  may be cleaned using a dry cotton pad or equivalent  prior to test 
material application.  
• Evenness of application will be verified by observation with a Woods Lamp.   If 
non-uniformity or streaking of the test material is noted, the test site shall be 
rejected and may not be used for testing. If another test site is available, re -
application of the test material should  be attempted.  
• Test material dispensing (test  site allocation, weight (mg), spreading time , drying 
time) will be recorded in source documentation .  
• Wait at least 15 mins after applying the test materials before commencing UV 
irradiation of unprotected and protected sites .

 8.0 Statistical Analysis  
Statistical analyses will be performed by  using Microsoft Excel 365 (2021).  Since 
all methodolog ies for the summary and statistical analyses of the data collected in this 
study are specified in th e protocol , a separate Reporting Analysis Plan (RAP) will not be 
created.  Any major modification of the analys is plan will be documented as a protocol 
amendment.  
 8.1 Analysis Population  
The analysis population will include all eligible participants (qualified based on the 
inclusion/exclusion criteria) who are  randomized, received study treatment and provide 
valid results.  
 
8.2 Participant Disposition and Demography  
Participant dispositio n and demographic characteristics will be tabulated and presented 
with summary descriptive statistics (sample size, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum and maximum) for continuous variables (e.g. , age) and frequency 
distributions for categorical vari ables (e.g., sex). 
 8.3 S
PF Computation 
The SPF values of each test product (tpSPFi) and the SPF  standard  (ssSPFi)  will first be 
computed for each individual participant  (to one decimal place)  as follows:  
SPFi = MEDp/MEDu R 
 The arithmetic mean SPF and standard deviation (SD) will then be calculated 
separately for each test product and the SPF standard from valid SPFi data; the 
standard error (SE) of the mean will also be calculated (n= no. participants who 
provide valid test results).

The labeled SPF value will be determined as the largest whole number less 
than the following calculation: 
 
Labeled SPF = Mean SPF – (t * SE)  
 
For the SPF determination of the test product s to be considered valid, in compliance 
with the FDA Final Rule 2011, the SPF value of the S PF standard should fall within the 
SD range of the expected SPF (i.e. 16.3 ± 3.43 or 12.87 to 19.73). [1]  
 
8.4 Summary Analyses  
Calculations and statistical analyses will be performed in compliance with the FDA Final 
Rule (2011) [1] and reviewed by  Qualit y Assurance. I ndividual participant  results 
will be tabulated along with summary statistics, including mean  SPF, valid test data 
used in the SPF calculations, SD, SE  and t-value (as described in Section 8.3) . Passed 
or failed grades will also be listed, along with excluded participants and reasons for 
exclusion .

10.0 Adverse E vents  
The s afety population  is defined as a ll randomized participants who received at least 
one dose of a study treatment.  
  
The PI, or designated  designe e(s), is responsible for detecting, documenting and 
reporting events that meet the definition of an AE or SAE .  
 
The PI, or designated designe e(s), is responsible  for following up serious AEs (SAEs) ; 
AEs considered to be test product (or study procedure) related ; and AEs  that caused 
the participant to discontinue  or be withdrawn from the study . 
 10.1 D
efinition of an Adverse Event (AE)  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study  participant, temporally 
associated with the use of a test product, whether or not considered related to the test 
product. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally 
associated with the use of a test product.  
 
Events Meeting the AE Definition:  
• Unexpected  or unusual reactions which occur within a test site  that cannot be 
completely described by the scale in Table 8 (e.g., hives) will be recorded as AEs.  
• Any abnormal laboratory test results (hematology, clinical chemistry, or 
urinalysis) or other safety assessments (e.g., ECG, radiological scans, vital sign measurements), including those that worsen after test product administration , 
considered clinically significant in the medical and scientific judgment of the PI or medically qualified designee  (i.e., not related to progression of underlying 
disease).  
• Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre -existing condition including either 
an increase in frequency and/or intensity of the condition  after test product 
administration.  
• New conditions detected or diagnosed after test product administration, even 
though it may have been present before the start of the study .  
• Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected drug- drug interaction.

22 • Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either test  
product or a concomitant  medication. Overdose per se will not be reported as an 
AE/SAE unless it is an intentional overdose taken with possible suicidal/self -
harming intent. Such overdoses should be reported regardless of sequelae.  
• ‘Lack of efficacy ’ per se will not be reported as an AE. Such instances will be 
captured in the efficacy assessments. However, the signs, symptoms, and/or 
clinical sequelae resulting from lack of efficacy will be reported as AE if they fulfill 
the definition of an AE.

23 Events NOT meeting the AE definition:  
• Any clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings (if applicable) or other 
abnormal safety assessments which are associated with an  underlying disease, 
unless judged by the PI, or medically qualified designee,  to be more severe than 
expected for the participant's condition.  
• A medical or surgical procedure (e.g., endoscopy, appendectomy) is not an AE. 
The condition that leads to the procedure is the  AE (e.g., gastritis, appendicitis).  
• Situations where an untowa rd medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or 
convenience admission to a hospital).  
• Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations in  a pre-existing disease /condition present or 
detected at the start of the study  that did  not worsen.  
• Localized erythema caused by exposure of the skin to UV radiation is expected and will not be reported as an adverse event.  
 10.2. Definition of a Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
An SAE is a particular category of AE  where the adverse outcome is serious. If an event 
is not an AE per definition above, then it cannot be an SAE even if serious conditions are met.  
 
A serious adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence at any dose that:  
• Results in death  
• Is life -threatening  
- The term 'life -threatening' in the definition of 'serious' refers to an event in 
which the participant was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does 
not refer to an event, which hypothetically might have caused death, if it were more severe .  
• Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
- In general, hospitalization signifies that the participant has been detained 
(usually involving at least an overnight stay) at the hospital or emergency 
ward for observation and/or treatment that would not have been 
appropriate in the physician's office or outpatient setting. Complications that occur during hospit alization are AEs. If a complication prolongs 
hospitalization or fulfills any other serious criteria, the event is serious. When in doubt as to whether ‘ hospitalization ’ occurred, or was necessary, 
the AE should be considered serious.  
- Hospitalization for elective treatment of a pre -existing condition that did 
not worsen from baseline is not considered an AE.  
• Results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity

24 - The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person's ability to 
conduct normal life functions.  
- This definition is not intended to include experiences of relatively minor 
medical significance such as an uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, 
diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma (e.g., sprained ankle) which may interfere w ith or prevent everyday life functions but do not constitute a 
substantial disruption.  
• Results in congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• Other situations:  
- Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether SAE 
reporting is appropriate in other situations , such as important medical 
events that may not be immediately life -threatening or result in death or 
hospitalization , but may jeopardize the participant  or may require medical 
or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes list ed in the 
above definition. These events should usually be considered serious.  
- Examples of such events include invasive or malignant cancers, intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions th at do not result in hospitalization, or 
development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
Note: Classification of an AE as 'serious' is based on the outcome of the event and is a 
factor in determining reporting requirements.  
 10.3 Expected Events  
UV Expected Events:  
Possible/expected side effects on and/or around the test sites  associated with UV 
exposure include the following:  
• Erythema (sunburn)  
• Mild discomfort  
• Itching  
• Edema (swelling)  
• Dryness/Tightness  
• Peeling

FDA 2011 FR SPF   GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare  
  Holdings (US) LLC (GSK CH)  
25 Any expected side effects experienced by the participant  after UV exposure of the test 
sites are not to be considered AEs .  Test products may not perform up to the  expected 
protection level.  Under protection outcomes are potential anticipated events and are 
also not to be considered AEs.  However, if any of th ese parameters/outcomes appear 
to be highly exacerbated, more than normally associated with the test procedures as determined by the PI , or designee, and lead to discontinuation , the event will be 
documented as an AE.    
 
Sk
incare Product Expected Events:  
There is always the  possibility of irritation or a skin reaction to any product  applied to 
the skin .  Examples of possible skincare product reactions are:  
• Redness  
• Dryness/tightness  
• Peeling  
• Itching  
• Burning/stinging  
• Allergic  reaction  
 Any skin reaction associated with the application of a test product to the test site will 
be considered an AE and documented as such.  
  
10.4. Time Period and Frequency for Collecting AE and SAE Information  
All AEs, and therefore all SAEs , will be collected immediately after a participant  
provides consent to participate in the trial by the completion (sign ing) of the ICF and 
until 14 days following last administration of test product (or last study procedure).  
Medical occurrences that began before obtaining informed consent will be recorded in 
the source documentation as Medical History/Current Medical Conditions , not as AEs.  
 All SAEs will be recorded and reported to the Sponsor , or designee , immediately and 
under no circumstance should this exceed 24 hours. The PI , or designee,  will submit 
any updated SAE data to the Sponsor within 24 hours of it being available.  
 The PI is  not obligated to actively seek AEs or SAEs after the conclusion of study  
participation. However, if the PI  learns of any SAE, including a death, at any time after 
a participant has been discharged from the study , and they  consider the event to be 
reasonab ly related to the test product or study  participation, the PI  must promptly 
notify the Sponsor. 
 
10.5. Reporting Procedures  
The PI, or medically qualified designee , is responsible for detecting, documenting and 
reporting all events that meet the definition of an AE and remains responsible for 
following up on AEs that are serious  or considered to be related to a test  product,

26 participation in the study  or a study  procedure, or that caused the participant to 
discontinue a test product or the study .  
 
Each participant  will be questioned about AEs . Spontaneous ly report ed AEs and those 
elicited by asking non -directive questions  (such as "How do you feel ?") will be 
assessed , recorded in AE -specific source documentation and reported appropriately. 
The PI, or medically qualified designee , is to report all directly observed AEs and all AEs 
spontaneously reported by a participant . 
 Each AE should be assessed to determine if it meets the criteria for a SAE. If an SAE 
occurs,  expedited reporting will follow local and international regulations, as 
appropriate.  
 When an AE occurs, it is the responsibility of the PI, or medically qualified designee , to 
review all documentation (e.g., hospital progress notes, laboratory and diagnostics reports) related to the event. The PI,  or designee,  will record all relevant information 
regarding an AE in AE -specific source documentation and all details relating to an SAE 
on the paper SAE f orm provided.  
 
It is not acceptable for the PI, or medically qualified designee , to send photocopies of a 
participan t’s medical records to GSK CH in lieu of completion of AE -specific  source  
documentation or the SAE  form. There may be instances when copies of medical 
records are requested by GSK CH. In this instance, all participant  identifiers, except for 
the participant number, will be redacted prior to sharing with GSK CH.  
 The PI, or medically qualified designee , will attempt to establish a diagnosis of the 
event base d on signs, symptoms, and/or other clinical information. The diagnosis 
should be the documented as the AE/SAE , where known, and not the individual 
signs/symptoms (e. g., upper respiratory tract infection, seasonal allergy ; not cough, 
runny nose).  
 AEs elicited by the PI, or medically qualified designee , during study visits should be 
recorded in AE -specific source documentation  and/or using the SAE form , as 
appropriate . Care will be taken not to introduce bias when questioning a participant 
about changes in their health. Open -ended and non -directive  verbal questioning should 
be used.  
 Reporting an Adverse Event :  
AEs will be reported using AE -specific source documentation by the PI or site staff  and 
the Sponsor -supplied SAE form , when appropriate , using concise medical terminology . 
Where the same data are collected, AE -specific source documentation  and the SAE 
form must be completed in a consistent manner ; the same AE term s should be used on 
both.  
 Reporting a Serious Adverse Event :

FDA 2011 FR SPF   GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare  
  Holdings (US) LLC (GSK CH)  
27 In addition to recording the details in AE-specific source documentation , an SAE form 
should be completed, as fully as possible. Hard copies of the paper SAE form will be 
provided for the Investigator Site  Master File. Original SAE forms should be retained in 
the Investigator Trial Master File .  
 It is essential to enter the following information:  
• Protocol and participant  identifiers  
• Participant  demography  
• Description of event (s), with diagnosis if available  
• PI opinion of relationship to test  product (or study  procedure, if appropriate)  
• Criterion for seriousness  
 
The following are desirable and are of particular relevance for PI  and GSK CH 
assessment of the SAE report:  
• Date of onset of event   
• Date event  stoppe d, if relevant  
• Test product start date  
• Test product end date , if relevant  
• Action taken in relation to the test product  
• Outcome if known  
 The SAE form, completed as fully as possible, must be scanned and e -mailed to the 
GSK CH Clinical Operations Safety  Reporting email box with the GSK CH study  number 
and participant number in the title  field of the email immediately and under no 
circumstance should this exceed 24 hours  after study  site personnel learn of the 
event. The PI  will submit any updated SAE data to the sponsor immediately and 
under no circumstance should this exceed 24 hours  of it being available. The GSK 
CH Study  Manager should also be notified of the situation by telepho ne or email.  
 
Email Serious Adverse Events to:  
 
 The
 GSK CH Study Manager , or designee , will be responsible for forwarding the SAE 
form to the Case Management Group, Global Clinical Safety and Pharmacovigilance mailbox ( ). The initial report will be followed up with more 
information as relevant, or as requested by the Sponsor . 
 10.6. Evaluating Adverse Events  
Assessment of Intensity :  
The PI, or medically qualified designee , will assess intensity for each AE reported

28 during the study  and will assign one of the following categories . 
• Mild: An event that is easily tolerated by the participant , causing minimal 
discomfort  and not interfering with everyday activities.  
• Moderate:  An event that is sufficiently discomforting to interfere with normal 
everyday activities  
• Severe:  An event that prevents normal everyday activities.  
 
NOTE:  An AE classified  as ‘severe’ should not be  confused with an SAE.  
‘Severe’ is  a category utilized to classify  the intensity of an event; both non -serious AEs 
and SAEs can be classified  as ‘severe’ . For example, a headache may be ‘ severe’ 
(interferes significantly with the participant 's usual function) but would not be classified 
as ‘serious ’ unless it met one of the criteria for an SAE, as described above  (Section 
1.2.2.). An event is defined as 'serious' when it meets at least 1 of the p re-defined 
outcomes as described  in Section 1.2.2., not when it is classified  as ‘severe’. 
 
Assessment of Causality  
Causality is one of the criteria used to  determin e regulatory reporting requirements. 
For each AE (serious and non -serious), the PI, or med ically qualified designee , must 
provide an assessment of causality i n the AE -specific source documentation and, for 
SAEs,  on the SAE form.  
 The PI, or medically qualified designee , will use clinical judgment to determine 
causality, having also  consult ed the Safety Statement provided by the Sponsor for this 
study . Alternative causes, such as underlying disease(s), concomitant therapy, other 
risk factors and the temporal relationship of the event to the test product will also be 
taken into consider ation and investigated.  
 There may be situations whe re an SAE has occurred , and the PI has minimal 
information to include in the initial report to GSK  CH. The PI is requi red to  make an 
assessment of causality prior to the initial transmission of the SAE form  to GSK CH ; 
they may change their  opinion of causality in light of follow -up information and send an 
SAE follow -up report with the updated causality assessment.  
 Relationship to Test  Material  
The relationship or association of the AE to test product  will be characterized as 
‘unlikely ’, ‘possible ’ or ‘probable ’ (Table 10).  
 
A ‘reasonable possibility ’ of relationship conveys  there are facts, evidence and/or 
arguments to suggest a causal relationship, rather than a relationship cannot be ruled out. The facts , evidence and/or arguments which  suggest a causal relationship should 
be provided in the AE report .  
 
For safety analyses, AEs classified as a ‘ possible ’ or ‘probable ’ association to test 
product  shall be considered test product -related AEs.

Response to withdrawal unclear or lacking  
Unlikely  Event or laboratory test abnormality, with a time to test product 
use that makes a relationship improbable (but not impossible)  
Condition (or disease) or other products provide plausible

 10.7. Follow -up o
 f AEs and SAEs  
After the initial AE/SAE report, the PI, or medically qualified designee,  is required to 
proactively follow up with each participant  and provide further information on the 
participant 's condition. All AEs (serious and non -serious) will be followed until 
resolution, until the condition stabilizes, until the event is otherwise explained or until 
the participant is lost to follow -up.  
 The PI, or medically qualified designee,  is obligated to perform or arrange for the 
conduct of supplemental measurements and/or evaluations as may be indicated or as requested by GSK CH to elucidate as fully as possible the nature and/or causality of an  
AE. This may include additional laboratory tests or investigations, histopathological examinations or consultation with other health care professionals. New or updated 
information will be recorded on the AE CRF page and, for SAEs, on the SAE form. The 
PI, or designee,  will submit updated SAE data to GSK CH within 24 hours of receipt of 
the information.  
 
The PI is  not obliged to actively seek AEs in former study participants . However, if the 
PI learns of a SAE, including death, at any time after a participant  has been discharged 
from the trial, and considers the event reasonably related to the test product or study

The GSK CH Study Manager , o r designee , will be responsible for forwarding the 
information to the Case Management Group, Global Clinical Safety and 
Pharmacovigilance group mailbox at GSK ).  
 The PI, or medically qualified designee,  will submit any updated SAE data to GSK CH 
within the designated reporting time frames .  
 10.8. Withdrawal Due to an Adverse Event  
Withdrawal due to an AE should be distinguished from withdrawal due to other causes, 
according to the definition of an AE noted earlier, and recorded i n the appropriate AE -
specific source document. When a participant  withdraws because of an SAE, the SAE 
must be reported as already  described.  
 10.9. Regulatory Reporting Requirements for SAEs  
GSK CH has a legal responsibility to notify, as appropriate, the local regulatory authority and other regulatory authorities about the safety of a product under clinical 
investigation. Prompt notification of SAEs by the PI  to GSK CH is essential so that legal 
obligations and ethical responsibilities towards the safety of study participants  are met.  
 
GSK CH will comply with country specific regulatory requirements relating to safety reporting to the regulatory authority  and IRB, and other investigators if applicable .  
 Investigator safety reports must be prepared for suspected unexpected serious adverse 
reactions (SUSAR) according to local regulatory requirements and sponsor policy and 
forwarded to investigators , as required.  
 
An investigator who receives an investigator safety report describing a SAE or other 
specific safety information (e.g., summary or listing of SAE f rom the sponsor ) will 
review it, file it with the Safety Statement in the Investigator Trial Master File  and then 
notify the IRB, if appropriate , according to local requirements.  
 
10.10.
 Pregnancy  
Time Period for Collecting Pregnancy Information  
Pregnancy information will be collected on all pregnancies reported while a female 
participant  is taking part  in the study , from the signing of informed consent until 14 
days after last administration of te st product.  
 Action to be Taken if Pregnancy Occurs   
The PI, or designee,  will record pregnancy information on the pregnancy form supplied 
by the S ponsor . The completed form should be scan ned and e -mailed to the GSK CH 
Clinical Operations Safety Reporting email box  
within 24 hours of learning of the pregnancy . The GSK CH Study Manager , or designee ,

32 will be responsible for forwarding the pregnancy form to the Case Management Group, 
Global Clinical Safety and Pharmacov igilance mailbox . Original 
pregnancy information forms should  be ret ained in the Investigator Trial Master File . 
 The female participant  will be followed to determine the outcome of the pregnancy. 
Information on the status of the mother and infant/neonate (including concomitant medications taken by the mother during the pregnancy) will be forwarded by the PI, or 
designee,  to the GSK CH Clinical Operations Safety Reporting email box and the GSK 
CH Study Manager , or designee , will forward t his information to the Case Management 
Group, Global Clinical Safety and Pharmacovigilance group mailbox at GSK 
. Generally, follow -up will be no longer than 6 to 8 weeks after  
the estimated delivery date. Any termination of the pregnancy  will be reported.  
 While pregnancy itself is not considered to be an AE, abnormal pregnancy outcomes 
(e.g., spontaneous abortion, fetal death, stillbirth, congenital anomalies, ectopic 
pregnancy) are, and should be recorded as an SAE. Any female particip ant who 
becomes pregnant during the study  will be withdrawn. If a female participant later 
discovers they were pregnant during the study, i.e., after their participation completed, 
their data will be considered valid for statistical analysis purposes . 
 
11.0 Data Recording and Study Record Maintenance  
Safety/efficacy d ata and additional clinical observations will be recorded in source 
documentation (e.g., case report forms [CRFs]) in accordance with the ALCOA+  
principles of data integrity ; data should be a ttributable , legible , contemporaneous , 
original , accurate , complete , consistent , enduring and a vailable . Correction of data 
recorded in source documentation w ill be carried out accord ance with  SOPs . 
  Source documents will include completed ICFs,  original records of clinical/instrumental 
observations, test product disposition/product accountability, AE reports, results and 
activities necessary to reconstruct and evaluate the study . Source documents  will be 
peer-reviewed by the site  staff as per  standard practice and/or in accordance with 
 SOPs.  
 
Source  documents and other study records (e.g., protocol, protocol amendments/ 
deviations, IRB approval(s), correspondence with the Sponsor/IRB, monito r 
log/reports) will be maintained in the Investigator Trial Master File  in accordance with 
the intent and purpose of GCP guidelines, SOPs and all applicable laws and 
regulations.  
 
12.0 Ethical Review

Statistical Analysis Plan , 25 July 2018  Page 4 of 78 1. INTRODUCTION 
The following statistical analysis plan  (SAP)  provides the framework for the 
summarization of the data from this study. The SAP  may change due to unforeseen 
circumstances. Any changes made from the planned analysis within protocol, after 
the unblinding, or  locking of the database will be documented in the clinical study 
report  (CSR) . The section referred to as Table Shells within this SAP describes the 
traceability of the tables, figures, and listings (TFLs) back to the data. N ote that the 
header for this page will be the one used for the main body of the CSR.  
Any additional exploratory analyses not  addressed within this SAP  and/or driven by 
the data, or requested by Aronora, Inc., will be considered out of scope and must be 
described in the CSR.  
2. OBJECTIVES AND ENDPOINTS  
2.1 Objectives  
The primary objective of the study is to assess the safety and tolerability of single 
intravenous ( IV) bolus doses of E -WE thrombin when administered to healthy adult 
subjects.  
The secondary objective  is to assess the pharmacodynamics  (PD) of single IV bolus 
doses of E -WE thrombin when administered to healthy adult subjects. The activated 
protein C/protein C inhibitor complex (APC -PCI) will be used as a surrogate 
biomarker for drug exposure.  
2.2 Endpoints  
The primary endpoi nts of the study will be the number and severity of treatment-
emergent adverse events ( TEAEs ) following single IV bolus doses of E -WE thrombin 
and placebo. In addition, physical examinations, vital signs, electrocardiograms 
(ECGs), clinical laboratory tests (including coagulation), thrombin time, immunogenicity, and injection site reaction will be assessed throughout the study. 
The secondary endpoints  are the PD (i.e., APC -PCI) of E -WE thrombin following 
single IV bolus doses. PD will act as a surrogate for  pharmacokinetics ( PK) of E -WE 
thrombin. 
3. STUDY DESIGN  
This is a randomized, double -blind, placebo- controlled, single ascending dose (SAD) 
study conducted at one study center in the United States (US).  Four (4) cohorts of either 6 subjects (Cohort 1 [4 act ive and 2 placebo]) or 5 subjects 
(Cohorts 2, 3, and 4 [4 active and 1 placebo]) are planned for evaluation.  
Aronora, Inc.  
E-WE thrombin, Protocol Number  CA19169 
Celerion, Clinical Study Report No. C A19169 
 
Statistical Analysis Plan , 25 July 2018  Page 5 of 78 In each cohort, subjects will receive a single IV bolus of E -WE thrombin or placebo. 
Subjects will participate in only 1 cohort. 
Cohort 1 will contain a sentinel group of 2 subjects (1 placebo and 1 active) who will 
be dosed at least 28  days before the remaining group of subjects. The remaining 
subjects in Cohort 1, and subjects in each of Cohorts 2, 3, and 4 will be dosed in 2 groups separated by a t least 14 days (2 subjects in each group [Cohort 1] or 
2 subjects in the first group and 3 subjects in the second group [Cohorts 2- 4]). The 
placebo will be randomized to one of the  groups .  
Dose escalation to the next dose level (i.e., next cohort) will not take place until after the Principal Investigator (PI) has reviewed the safety data. If any findings in the safety data are of concern, then the Safety Review Committee (SRC) comprised of but not limited to, the Sponsor, medical monitor, and the PI will  convene to determine 
if adequate safety and tolerability from the previous cohort has been demonstrated to permit proceeding to the next cohort. Data from all subjects in the cohort will be used and reviewed for a dose escalation decision and a minimum of  4 subjects must 
complete the study (up to Day 14) before proceeding to the next higher dosing cohort.  
Subjects will participate in only one cohort. An attempt will be made to have at least 30% of the total subjects of a race/ethnicity minority group. An a ttempt will be made 
to include at least 2  females per cohort.  
Safety (i.e., physical examinations, vital signs, ECGs, clinical laboratory tests [including coagulation], thrombin time, immunogenicity, injection site reaction, and AEs) will be assessed throughout the study.  
Blood samples will be collected for PD asses sment  (i.e., APC -PCI) of E -WE 
thrombin.  
Blood samples will be also collected for the ADA evaluation . 
Subjects will be housed on Day - 1, at the time indicated by the clinical research unit 
(CRU ), until after the 24- hour blood draw and/or study procedures. At all times, a 
subject may be required to remain at the CRU for longer at the discretion of the PI or 
designee.  
Subjects (including those who terminate early) will return on Days 14 and 28 for follow -up (FU) procedures (coagulation sample collection, thrombin time 
measurement, and immunogenicity sample collection) and to determine if any AE has occurred since the last study visit). Subjects who terminate the study early will be asked to continue aPTT and thrombin time monitoring as scheduled until Day 28. 
Any subjects for whom aPTT and/or thrombin time did not reach ±  10% of the 
baseline value or within the normal range by Day 14, will return every 7 days 
(±2 days) until aPTT and thrombin time reach ±10% of the baseline value or within

Day 28 will be repeated) 7 days (± 2 days) after it was reached.  
The total planned duration of subject participation is approximately 56 days from 
screening to last FU . 
4. ANALYSIS POPULATIONS  
4.1 Analysis Populations  
Safety population:   All subjects who received the study drug (active or placebo) will 
be included in the safety summary. 
PD population:   All subjects receiving the study drug (active or placebo) and having 
any measurable PD  data will be included in the PD data set. The Sponsor will assess 
the real time aPTT on -site. The  protein C  samples will be processed by Celerion 
associates and then shipped to Aronora for later analysis .  
4.2 Preliminary  Data and Interim Analysis  
If there ar e safety concerns, all available blinded safety /tolerability  data (i.e., physical 
examinations, ECGs, vital signs, clinical laboratory tests [including coagulation], 
thrombin time, injection site reaction, and AEs available for all subjects who have comple ted up to Day 14 procedures) will be reviewed by the SRC prior to dose 
escalation.  
At the Sponsor’s request, unblinded safety tables, figures, and data listings may be presented to the sponsor’s medical expert and head of regulatory for the purposes of planning the next initial Phase 2 studies prior to database lock. These interim analyses 
will be performed on data that will be edit- checked and monitored. 
A safety programmer and a biostatistician at Celerion who are not involved with the present study will  be unblinded to prepare the required unblinded safety tables, 
figures, and data listings. All the personnel related to the present study will remain blinded. 
5. TREATMENT DESCRIPTIO NS 
E-WE thrombin will be supplied as sterile, non- pyrogenic, preservative -free liquid for 
IV administration. E -WE thrombin will be supplied as 0.1 mg/mL for IV use and

6.2 Real -Time aPTT  
Blood samples for real -time aPTT will be analyzed by Aronora on site. Samples will 
be collected in blood collection tubes containing 3.2% sodium citrate by a Celerion 
employee and  transferred directly to an Aronora employee for sample processing as 
per their internal procedures.  
At the end of the study, platelet poor plasma samples obtained by centrifugation of citrated blood will be shipped to the Sponsor for their internal analyses.  
Blood samples for the assessment of real -time aPTT will be co llected at predose, 
0.083, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 24 hours postdose. 
Data for real-time aPTT will not be analyzed by Celerion. 
6.3 Protein C  
Blood sample for the asse ssment of protein C will be collected at the following 
timepoints: predose, 1, 2, and 24 post dose. The protein C samples will be processed 
by Celerion associates and then shipped to Aronora for their internal analys es. 
Data for protein C will not be analyzed by Celerion. 
6.4 Data Summarization and Presentation  
All PD markers will be tabulated by dose level  and a pooled placebo group . Summary 
statistics, including the number of observations (n), arithmetic mean  (mean) , standard 
deviation ( SD), coefficient of variation ( %CV ), minimum, median, and maximum 
will be computed.  The level of precision  will be presented as follows: n will be presented without 
decimal, mean, SD, minimum, median, and maximum will be presented to 1 decimal 
place. All percentages will be presented to 1 decimal place.  
7. IMMUNOGENICITY

positive ADA.  
8. SAFETY  
No inferential statistics will be performed on the safety endpoints.  
All Case Report Form (CRF) data will be listed by subject and chronologically by assessment time points. This will include rechecks, unscheduled assessments, and early termination results.  
Applicable continuous variables will be summarized using the numbe r of 
observations (n), mean, SD, minimum, median, and maximum. Frequency counts will 
be reported for categorical data, when appropriate. The placebo subjects from all cohorts will be pooled into a single group for summarization.   
The level of precision wi ll be presented as follows: minimum/maximum in the same 
precision as in the database, mean/median in one more precision level than minimum/maximum, SD in one more precision level than mean/median, and n will be presented as an integer.  
For laboratory, ECGs , and vital signs, where individual data points are missing 
because of dropouts or other reasons, the data will be summarized based on reduced denominators. 
8.1 Subject Discontinuation 
Subject disposition will be listed and summarized by number of subjects dos ed, 
completed, and discontinued the study with discontinuation reasons by dose level, pooled placebo, and for overall the study.  
8.2 Demographics  
Demographic data will be listed and summarized. Descriptive statistics will be calculated for continuous variables  (age, weight, height, and body mass index [BMI]) 
by dose level, pooled placebo, and for overall the study. Frequency counts will be provided for categorical variables (race, ethnicity, and sex) by dose level, pooled placebo, and for overall the study. Age  will be derived from date of birth to date of 
first dosing. 
8.3 Adverse Events  
All AEs occurring during this clinical trial will be coded using the MedDRA
®, 
Version 21.0 or a later version if available. All AEs captured in the database will be listed in by -subject data listings including verbatim term, coded term, dose level, 
placebo, severity, relationship to study drug, and action; however, only treatment -

Celerion, Clinical Study Report No. C A19169 
 
Statistical Analysis Plan , 25 July 2018  Page 10 of 78 emergent AEs (TEAEs) will be summarized. Any non- drug procedure performed due 
to an AE will be listed by  subject.  
A TEAE is defined as an AE that is starting or worsening at the time of or after the 
study drug dose administration. If an AE increases in severity, that AE will be given a resolution date and time and a new record will be initiated with the new severity. If the severity of an AE remains the same or decreases, the AE will be kept open through to resolution and the maximum severity will be recorded. If the onset time of an AE is missing and the onset date is the same as the treatment dosing date  or does 
not fall on a dosing date , the AE will be considered treatment -emergent. If the onset 
date of an AE is missing, then the AE will be considered treatment -emergent. 
TEAEs will be tabulated by system organ class (SOC) and preferred term. Summary tables will include number of subjects reporting the TEAE and corresponding percentage by dose level, pooled placebo, and overall the study. The number of TEAEs will be summarized in a similar way. Percentages will be based on the total number of subjects dosed or total number of TEAEs, respectively, for each dose level, pooled placebo, or overall the study, as appropriate. In addition, the number of TEAEs will be summarized by severity and relationship to study drug. 
If present, serious adverse events (SAEs) will  be listed, displayed in a table, and a 
narrative included in the study CSR.  
8.4 Clinical Lab oratory Test s (Serum Chemistry, Hematology, Coagulation, 
 Urinalysis)  
Clinical laboratory reference ranges will be listed by laboratory group, test, sex, and 
age category, where appropriate.  
Serum chemistry, hematology, coagulation, and urinalysis will be performed at the following time points:

Statistical Analysis Plan , 25 July 2018  Page 11 of 78 • for numerical results: high (H) and low (L);  
• for categorical results: did -not-match (*).  
If a value fails the reference range, it will automatically be compared to a computer 
clinically significant (CS) range (2nd flag).  
• If the value falls within the computer CS range, it will be noted as “N” for not clinical significant.  
• If the value fails the CS range, it will be flagged with a “Y” which prompts the PI to determine how the out -of-range value should be followed using 4 PI 
flags (3
rd flag):  
o "N", not clinically significant,  
o "R", requesting a recheck,  
o "^", checking at the next scheduled visit,  
o "Y", clinically significant.  
To distinguish the PI flags from the computer CS range flags, the PI flags “N” and “Y” will be  presented as “- “ and “+” in the data listing, respectively.  
In addition, a derived flag (a 4
th flag) based on a search of the PI comments for a 
comment of “CS” or “Clinically Significant” will be used. The derived flag will be populated with “+” if the positive clinically significant determination is found in the comments for cases when the PI flag is populated with a “^” or a “R”.  
Out-of-range values and corresponding recheck results will be listed. Out -of-range 
values are considered to be values that are out -of- normal range as defined by the 
clinical laboratory. Results that are indicated as CS by the PI (either in the PI flag or in PI comments) will be also listed in a separate table.  
For all safety values that are numeric, descriptive statistics will be presented for each laboratory test by dose level, pooled placebo, and time point. Change from baseline 
will be summarized in a similar way. In addition, for the a ctivated partial 
thromboplastin t ime (aPTT) (coagulation test), the fold c hange from baseli ne will be 
calculated and summarized in a similar way. The following formula will be used  for 
the calculation : postdose/baseline. Baseline is defined as the result closest and prior to 
the dose on Day 1 (i.e., Day 1 for Coagulation and Day - 1 for the rest of tests) which 
may include unscheduled or recheck results, whichever is later. Postdose unscheduled events or rechecks will not be included in summaries. Similarly early termination results will not be included in summaries.

the results at baseline (above normal, normal, or below normal) with the respective 
postdose results. For urinalysis tests, the categories are normal and outside normal. 
8.5 Vital Signs  
Single measurements of systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, body temperature, and respiratory rate will be obtained in supine position at the following time points:

be included in summaries. Similarly early termination results will not be included in summaries.  
8.6 Electrocardiogram  
Single 12- lead ECGs (i.e., HR, PR, QRS, QT, and QTcF [i.e., QT corrected for heart 
rate using Fridericia’s correction]) will be measured at the following time points:

  Programmer Notes:  Replace Parameter1, 2 etc. with actual lab tests in the study. Sort unscheduled assessment and early termination 
chronologically with other scheduled assessments and rechecks.  Recheck should be sorted with the scheduled time point the 
recheck is for.  
 
Clinically significant lab values will be generally captured as AEs, some of which the PI may indicate in Appendix 
16.2.8.1.6  lab comments (as per GPG.03.0028 sections 2.9 and 2.10). Derive an additional flag for PI flag - /+ based on 
comments (i.e. NCS/CS). Present this derived 4
th column in all tables, and list only PI- determined out- of-range clinically 
significant lab values i n Table 14.3.4. 5.

Clinically significant lab values generally will be captured as AEs, some of which the PI may indicate in Appendix 16.2.8.1.6  lab comments (as per GPG.03.0028 sections 2.9 and 2.10). Derive an additional flag for PI flag (+) based on 
positive CS/Clinically Significant comments. Present this derived 4th column in all tables, and also list the PI-determined out- of-range clinically significant lab values in Table 14.3.4.5 .

 1 1. RCT DeƚailƐ  
This section provides a high -level overview of a ƉƵbliƐhed  RCT that the described real -world evidence study is trying to replicate 
as closely as possible given the remaining limitations inherent in the healthcare databases.  
1.1 Title 
Once -Daily Single -Inhaler Triple versus Dual Therapy in Patients with COPD ( IMPACT Trial ) 
1.2 Intended aim(s)  
To assess the effect of once -daily combination of fluticasone furoate at a dose of 100 ug, umeclidinium at a dose of ϲ2.ϱug, and 
vilanterol at a dose of 2ϱ ug (“tripl e therapy”) versus fluticasone furoate -vilanterol —at doses of 100ug and 2ϱug, respectively —on the 
annual rate of moderate or severe COPD exacerbations. (Note: RCT compares additional arm of umeclidinium -vilanterol).  
1.3 Primary endpoint for replication  
The p rimary endpoint is the rate of moderate or severe COPD exacerbations defined as an exacerbation leading to treatment with 
antibiotics or systemic glucocorticoids or one resulting in hospitalization or death.  
1.4 Required power for primary endpoint and noninfe riority margin (if applicable)  
This trial is a superiority trial. Assuming that the annual rate of moderate or severe exacerbation would be 0.ϴ0 among patients treated 
with triple therapy and 0.ϵ1 among those treated with fluticasone furoate -vilanterol, it  was determined that approximately 4000 
patients would be needed in the triple -therapy group and 4000 in the fluticasone furoate -vilanterol group to achieve ϵ0й power to 
conclude superiority of  triple therapy over fluticasone furoate - vilanterol at two si ded alpha of 0.01.  
1.5 Secondary endpoint for replication (assay sensitivity) and RCT finding  
Pneumonia (Hazard ratio, HRс1.02; ϵϱй CI, 0.ϴϳ -1.1ϵ) comparing flutica sone  furoate -umeclidinium -vilanterol vs. flutica sone  furoate -
vilanterol.  
1.6 Trial estimate  
Rate ratio, RRс0.ϴϱ (ϵϱй CI, 0.ϴ0 -0.ϵ0) comparing fluticasone furoate -umeclidinium -vilanterol vs. fluticasone furoate -vilanterol during    
ϱ2 weeks (Lipson et al., 201ϴ).

5.1 Cohort Summary  
This study will involve a new user , parallel group, propensity score -matched, retrospective cohort study design comparing triple 
therapy to fluticasone furoate -vilanterol users. The patients will be required to have continuous enrollment during a baseline 
period of 1ϴ0 days before initiation of triple therapy or fluticasone furoate -vilanterol (index date). We will restrict the analyses to 
patients with a diagnosis of COPD who have been receiving daily maintenance therapy for at least 3 months prior to index  date.  
 
5.2 Important steps for cohort formation  
New use of fluticasone furoate -umeclidinium -vilanterol (exposure), and fluticasone furoate -vilanterol (comparator) is defined as no 
use of either therapy in 1ϴ0 days prior to index date  
 
5.2.1 Eligible cohort entry dates  
Market availability of  fluticasone furoate -umeclidinium -vilanterol in the U.S. for management of COPD was approved by FDA 
on September 1ϴ, 201ϳ  
 IBM® MarketScan® : September 1ϴ, 201ϳ – December 31, 201ϴ (end of available data)  
 Optum CDM: Septemb er 1ϴ, 201ϳ – June 30 , 2020 (end of available data)  
 
5.2.2 Specify inclusion/exclusion  criteria  for cohort entry and define the index date  
Inclusion and exclusion criteria were adapted from the trial as closely as possible. Definitions for all inclusion/exclusi on are

6. VaƌiableƐ  
 
6.1 Exposure -related variables:  
 
Study drug:  
The study exposure of interest is new initiation of fluticasone furoate -umeclidinium -vilanterol.  New initiation will be defined by no use of 
fluticasone furoate -umeclidinium -vilanterol  in the prior 180 days  before treatment initiation (washout period).  
 
Comparator agent : 
New initiators of fluticasone furoate -vilanterol. New initiation will be defined by no use of fluticasone furoate -vilanterol in the prior  180 days   
before treatment initiation  
 
6.2 Preliminary Covariates:  
x Age 
x Gender  
x Combined Comorbidity Index (CCI), measured over the baseline covariate assessment period, defined as 1ϴ0 days prior to 
and including index date . 
 
Covariates listed above represent only a small subset of covariates that will ultimately be controlled for in the design and analysis. We use the 
covariates above only for initial feasibility analyses to judge whether there is likely to be sufficient overlap between trea tment gro ups to 
proceed with the study. Remaining covariates are defined only after the study has passed the initial feasibility analysis and  the initial power 
assessment and are listed in Table 1 ( Appendix B ).  
 
6.3 Outcome variables and study follow -up:  
 
6.3.1 Outcome variables  
 
Effectiveness outcome variables of interest (definitions provided in Appendix A ): 
 Primary outcome: Annual rate of moderate or severe COPD exacerbations during treatment  
 Control outcome of interest : Pneumonia  
Effectiveness research with Real World Data to support FDA’s regulatory decision making  
 
 ϲ  
6.3.2 Study follow -up 
Both as -treated (AT) and intention -to-treat (ITT) analyses will be conducted with treatment defined as the index drug on the day of cohort entry. 
Because adherence in the real -world databases is expected to be much worse than in the trial, the AT analysis is the primary analysis , as it targets 
the relative hazard of outcomes on treatment.  
The follow -up will start the day after drug initiation (i.e., cohort entry date), as described in the IMPACT, and will continue until the earliest date of 
the following ev ents:  
x The first occurrence of the outcome of interest,  
x The date of end of continuous registration in the database,  
x End of the study period,  
x Measured death event occurs,  
x Nursing home admission  
o Nursing home admissions are considered a censoring event because the data sources utilized typically provide little to no data on 
a patient, particularly on drug utilization, after admission. We will utilize this as an exclusion reason for cohorts for the  same 
reason.    
x The date of drug discontinuation, defined as the date of the last continuous treatment episode of the index d rug plus a defined 
grace period (i.e., ϲ0 days after the end of the last prescription’s days’ supply in main analyses).  
 
For the intention -to-treat (ITT) analyses, the censoring based on th e augmentation/switching and treatment discontinuation 
will be replaced with a maximum allowed follow -up time of 365 days.

correction of moderate to severe 
perioral rhytids  Study Sites  Multicenter , maximum  3 US sites 
Title  A randomized, controlled, double -blinded, within -subject (split -face), multicenter, 
prospective clinical study to compare the level of pain using the dermal filler RHA® 1 
formulated with two different anesthetics in the treatment of perioral rhytids  
Sponsor  TEOXANE  SA, Rue de Lyon 105, CH - 1203 Geneva , Switzerland  
Study Duration  Approximately  60 days  Number of 
Subjects  Maximum  30 subjects treated with 
RHA® 1 and RHA® 1-M with at least 
20% of subjects presenting Fitzpatrick 
skin type IV to VI including at least 
10% of subjects presenting Fitzpatrick 
skin type V to VI . 
Treatment Groups  Each enrolled subject will receive  injections of RHA® 1-M with MEPIVACAINE into the  
perioral rhytids of the  left or right side of the mouth , and injections of the control device (i.e., 
RHA® 1 with lidocaine) into the perioral rhytids of the contralateral side of the mouth . 
Study Design  This is a randomized, controlled, double -blinded, within -subject (split -face), multicenter, 
prospective study to investigate  whether RHA® 1-M with MEPIVACAINE is non -inferior to 
RHA® 1 with lidocaine  in terms of injection site pain felt by the subject during injection . 
At screening, t he Treating Investigator (TI) will evaluate subject s’ perioral rhytid severity 
(using the Perioral Rhytid Severity Rating Scale; PR -SRS) to confirm eligibility and to 
establish a pre -treatment score for assess ing aesthetic improvement.  
At Visit 1, RHA® 1-M with MEPIVACAINE will be administered in a random sequence (first 
or second injection) and side of the mouth  (left or right) and RHA® 1 with lidocaine will be 
administered to the other side. Study subjects and the TI injecting study devices will be 
blinded.  
The perioral area w ill be divided into 4 quadrants ( upper right , upper  left, lower right , lower 
left). There will be a no -treatment zone of approximately 8 mm between the Cupid’s bow on 
the upper lip and the same distance on the lower lip area in order to be able to assess the 
difference of the anesthetic effect between the two products. If needed to improv e cosmetic 
result , the lower perioral quadrant s will be injected , but only after both upper quadrant s have 
been injected.  
Immediately after injection  of an upper perioral  quadrant , subjects will rate injection site pain 
experienced during injection  using a 100 mm Visual Analog Scale (VAS). Injection site pain 
in each side  of the mouth will also be assessed at 15, 30, 45 and 60 minutes after the upper 
quadrant was injected.  
Additionally, subjects will assess anesthetic sensation  on each side of the mouth every hour  
until normal sensation returns . 
Safety evaluation will consist of AE assessments, a 30-day CTR  (Common Treatment 
Response)  diary, assessments of visual disturbances (i.e., Snellen visual acuity,

call performed by the study site at 72 hours after injection.  
Subjects will attend Visit 2 ( 30 days post-injection ) where efficacy and safety assessments 
will be conducted . Subject s who present with an unresolved clinically significant device 
related AE at Visit 2 will receive the optional  follow -up phone call no later than 30 days after 
Visit 2 . If the clinically significant AE remains unresolved, the Investigator will request that 
the subject  to attend the optional in-clinic follow -up visit (i.e., Visit 3)  within 5 working days . 
Follow -up of the clinically significant AE will continue until the AE is resolved or the TI 
determines that additional follow -up is not necessary.  
At study exit (i.e., Visit 2 , optional follow -up phone call,  or Visit 3) , subjects will be offered 
treatment with a commercially available dermal filler  approved for injection into the perioral 
rhytids  if they present wrinkles/lines in the no -treatment zone .  
Hypothesis  The anesthetic effect of RHA® 1-M with MEPIVACAINE will be non -inferior to RHA® 1 
with lidocaine  in terms of injection site pain felt by the subject during injection  into the upper 
perioral rhytids assessed immediately after injection  of each upper  quadrant  using a 100 mm 
Visual Analog Scale  (VAS) . 
Objectives  Demonstrate the non -inferiority of RHA® 1-M with MEPIVACAINE versus the control  
(RHA® 1 with lidocaine)  in terms of reducing pain during device injection  into the upper 
perioral rhytids . Injection p ain during injection  will be based on the 100 mm Visual Analog 
Scale (VAS), as assessed by subjects immediately after injection  of each upper perioral 
quadrant .

Device 
Administration  Depth of injection: Study device will be administ ered into the dermis, including the 
superficial dermis  at the discretion of the TI.  
Injection technique: The injection technique (e.g., linear threading, cross hatching, fan like 
administration, multiple puncture)  will be at the discretion of the TI, and will be recorded.  
The same injection technique s will be used on both sides  of the mou th. 
Injection area: For the purposes of this study, the lip will be defined as the structures within 
the vermilion border. The focus of this study is to treat perioral rhytids, and there will be no 
augmentation of the lips, but the vermilion border may be treated to ensure a satisfactory 
result of the treatment of the perioral rhytids.  
Injection volume : The maximum volume per administration of a study device into the 
perioral rhytids (upper and lower)  is 6.0 mL  (max 3.0 mL for  right side , and max 3.0 mL for 
left side ). 
No Treatment Zone:  To minimize potential overlap of anesthetic effects of each study 
device, left and right perioral areas will be separated by a “ no treatment zone ” defined as t he 
area between philtral columns  (approximately 8mm). Similarly, a no treatment zone of the 
lower perioral area will be defined as t he ~8mm area directly below the upper perioral no 
treatment zone.  
Blinding  This is a double -blinded study . Subjects and TI will be blinded to treatment allocation.  
Randomization  A randomization algorithm will provide equal balancing for the side of the mouth  and the 
order of injection  of study devices  (i.e., left or right / 1st or 2nd order).  
Visit Procedures  Refer to the Study Summary Tables and the Study Schematic for a schedule of activities.

o Lip function - a subject’s ability to suck liquid through a straw  
o Lip sensation - a subject’s ability to feel the change in sensation to touch  
o Lip movement - a subject’s ability to pronounce a preselected series of words  
• Assessment of visual disturbances ( Snellen visual acuity, confrontational visual field test, 
ocular motility).  
Primary Endpoint  Injection site pain  felt during  injection  of the upper perioral quadrant assessed by the subject 
immediately following injection  with RHA® 1-M with MEPIVACAINE compared to the 
injection site pain felt during  injection  into the contralateral upper perioral quadrant assessed 
immediately following injection  with RHA® 1 with lidocaine.  
Secondary 
Endpoints  • Injection Site Pain  in each side of the mouth  at 15, 30, 45 and 60 minutes after injection  in 
each upper perioral quadrant . 
• Duration of anesthetic effect in each side of the mouth commencing at the time of the final 
Injection Site Pain assessment.  
• Perioral Rhytid Severity Rating Scale (PR -SRS) of each side of the mouth  at Visit 1 (pre - 
and post-injection ) and at Visit 2.  
• FACE -Q assessment of each side of the mouth at Visit 1 (pre -injection ) and at Visit 2 . 
• Global aesthetic improvement (GAI) of each side of the mouth at Visit 1 ( post-injection ) 
and at Visit 2.  
• Patient Satisfaction for each side of the mouth  at Visit 1 ( post-injection ) and at Visit 2.  
• Volume injected in each upper perioral quadrant . 
• Volume injected in each side of the mouth.  
Sample Size  A minimum sample size of 10 subjects will provide >80% power at 5% significance level 
(one-sided) to detect a 10mm non -inferiority of the pain felt  in the upper perioral quadrants  
during  injection  with RHA® 1-M with MEPIVACAINE compared to pain felt during  injection  
with RHA® 1 with lidocaine.  
Due to the small number of subjects needed according to this simulation and to the variability 
in human pain tolerance,  the Sponsor increase d the sample size of the study from 10 to 30 . 
Statistical Methods  The primary endpoint will be analyzed in a non -inferiority statistical model using the pain 
felt by the subject during injection  of the upper perioral quadrants . A difference of 10mm 
between the two treatment groups will be used as the non -inferiority marg in. 
If non -inferiority is achieved, the pain felt during injection  by the subject will be analyzed in 
terms of superiority , specifically, to confirm if RHA® 1-M is superior to RHA® 1 for reducing 
pain.  
Statistical analysis of the primary endpoint will be performed using paired one -sided tests, 
with a significance level of 0.05, either parametric or non -parametric as appropriate.

1.1 Background  
Hyaluronic acid (HA) is a long -chain, repeated dimer, N -acetyl glucosamine and D -glucuronic 
acid polymer and is a major component of the extracellular matrix. HA is widely present in all 
animal species and does not differ from one species to another. Due t o this extended compatibility, 
non-human HA can be used in humans without unacceptable adverse effects.  Due to its natural 
viscoelastic and hydrogel properties, HA is widely used as matrix in tissue regeneration and 
particularly in dermal defect reconstruc tion. 
It was demonstrated that by chemically crosslinking the molecule, HA becomes resistant to 
degradation and its persistence in tissues is increased.1,2 This does not affect the carboxylic and N-
acetyl functions of the molecule and allows modification of the rheological and physical properties 
of HA while maintaining the biocompatibility of the basic polymer.3 
Dermal fillers in general, and hyaluronic acid ( HA) fillers specifically, are aesthetic devices that 
are not used for the diagnosis or treatment of any specific disease state . Rather , they are used  for 
the treatment of age -related wrinkles/folds and facial volume loss .  Specific use data are published 
on the American Society of Plastic Surgeons (ASPS)  website .  Based on Teoxane’s knowl edge of 
the aesthetic industry, it is likely that most  HA dermal filler procedures are performed by 
dermatologists , aesthetic nurses, and/or physician assistants rather than by plastic surgeons . 
However, as use statistics are not available from the various  dermatological societies, the data 
below are likely an underestimation of the total number of dermal filler procedures  performed in 
the U.S. .  It is not expected that the demographics of this indication would be substantially different 
from the ASPS data.  
The following data for 2018 w ere extracted from the ASPS website  in June 2019  
(https://www.plasticsurgery.org/news/plastic -surgery -statistics ): 
• 15.9 M cosmetic minimally invasi ve procedures, up 2% from previous year  
• 2.68 M procedures with any dermal filler, up 2% from previous year  
• 2.13 M procedures with HA, up 2% from previous year  
• 36% of all HA filler procedures were in patients ≥ 55 years old  
• 3% of all HA filler procedures we re in males  
While d ata are not available from ASPS regarding race or ethnic -specific subgroups , data from 
various HA dermal fillers clinical trials indicate that the majority of subjects are Caucasian 
females .  Historically, a pproximately 20 -25% of subjects enrolled in dermal filler studies have 
been Fitzpatrick skin types IV -VI (as per FDA requirements for minimum enrollment of darker 
skin type subjects in these studies ). As such, the percentage of darker skin types treated in  dermal 
filler studies is not necessarily representative of real world experience for patients seeking many 
dermal filler aesthetic procedures/indications, such as lip augmentation.  
RHA® 1 and RHA® 1-M dermal filler s are device s containing colorless, biodegradable, sterile, 
biocompatible, crosslinked HA of non -animal origin (i.e., bacterial fermentation using 
Streptococcus zooepidemicus ). Crosslinking is performed using 1,4 -butanediol diglycidyl ether 
(BDDE) to form a gel. RHA® 1 product contains 0.3% w/w of lidocaine hydrochloride, and RHA® 
1-M contains 0.3% w/w of MEPIVACAINE  hydrochloride. Both lidocaine and MEPIVACAINE  
are drug substance s widely used for their anesthetic properties (i.e., they block the origin and 
transmission  of nervous influx at the point of injection by stabilizing the neuronal membrane).  
TEOXANE SA                        Protocol TEO -RHA -1801  
CONFIDENTIAL  
v.1.5; 10 -Sep-2019                        Page 16 of 57 RHA® 1 and RHA® 1-M are intended for injection in the dermis and superficial dermis of the face 
to correct moderate to severe perioral rhytids.  RHA® 1 is an investigational device that has not yet 
been approved by the FDA.  TEOXANE S.A. has recently completed a pivotal clinical study (IDE 
number G160123) investigating RHA® 1 for the treatment of perioral rhytids that is intended to 
secure a Premarket Approval ( PMA ) from the FDA  for this device . All subjects in this study have 
completed their final visits, there were no UADEs or Treatment -Related SAEs, and data analysis 
is in progress . The primary endpoint was achieved.  
1.2 Rationale for Study  
Similar to lidocaine, MEPIVACAINE is a local anesthetic of the amide type . A new formulation 
of RHA® 1, substituting MEPIVACAINE for lidocaine, has been developed for specific 
commercial reasons . RHA® 1-M is identical to RHA® 1 except that the 0.3% w/w of lidocaine 
hydrochloride has been replaced with another anesthetic agent, 0.3% w/w of MEPIVACAINE 
hydrochloride. In the current study, a non -inferiority pivotal study designed to support a  PMA 
application (FDA) for RHA® 1-M with MEPIVACAINE , RHA® 1 with lidocaine (control ) will be 
compared to RHA® 1-M with MEPIVACAINE . 
1.3 Hypothesis  
The anesthetic effect of RHA® 1-M with MEPIVACAINE  will be non -inferior to  RHA® 1 with 
lidocaine  in terms of injection site pain felt by the subject during injection  into the upper  perioral 
rhytids assessed immediately after injection  of each upper quadrant  using a 100 mm Visual Analog 
Scale (VAS ).

v.1.5; 10 -Sep-2019                        Page 17 of 57 2 STUDY OBJECTIVE  
The study objective  is to demonstrate the non -inferiority of RHA® 1-M with MEPIVACAINE  
versus the control ( RHA® 1 with lidocaine) in terms of reducing pain during device injection into 
the upper perioral rhytids . Injection pain during injection  will be based on the 100 mm Visual 
Analog Scale (VAS), as assessed by subjects immediately after injection  of each upper perioral 
quadrant .

CONFIDENTIAL  
v.1.5; 10 -Sep-2019                        Page 18 of 57 3 COMPLIANCE STATEMENT  
The study will be conducted in accordance with the protocol, International Conference on 
Harmonization (ICH) and Good Clinical Practice (GCP), the Declaration of Helsinki, and the 
United States (US) Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) applicable to clinical studies (45  CFR Part 
46, 21 CFR Part 50, 21 CFR Part 56, and 21 CFR Part 312 ). In addition, the study will be conducted 
in compliance with all applicable laws and regulatory requirements relevant to the use of new 
medical devices  in the United States . 
The sites’ Principal Investigator  (also referred to as the  Treating Investigator [TI] , both terms are 
used interchangeably) is responsible for ensuring the privacy, safety and welfare of the subjects 
during and after the study, and must ensure that personnel are trained and immediately available 
in case of a medical emergency. The TI must be familiar with the background and requirements of 
the study and with the properties of the study device as described in the Investigator ’s Brochure 
and package inserts . The Principal Investigator at each site has the overall responsibility for the 
conduct and administration of the study at their site, and for contact with study site management, 
and local authorities.  ethica CRO  will facilitate and manage all interactions bet ween the site and 
the IRB.   
3.1 Variations to the Protocol  
No changes from the final approved (signed) protocol will be initiated without the prior approval 
of the FDA and the IRB except  1) when necessary to eliminate immediate hazards to the subjects 
or when the change involves only logistics or administration , or 2) minor administrative or 
typographical corrections.  The sites’ Principal Investigator s and the Sponsor must sign any 
protocol amendments.  
3.2 Investigational Sites  
Maximum  three (3) U.S. investigational sites will participate in this study. Each site will obtain 
written approval from a Central IRB prior to recruitment and enrollment of any subject into the 
study. Any changes to the s tudy procedures must be made with the mutual agreement of the 
Principal Investigator and the Sponsor, documented in an amendment to the protocol, and 
approved by the reviewing IRB.  
Each site will have one TI who will be responsible for administering all s tudy treatments,  assess ing 
safety, and conduct ing subject assessments . TIs will be specialists in the fields of cosmetic 
dermatology or plastic surgery and will have extensive experience with dermal fillers. The TI will 
function as the site’ s Principal Investigator.  Additionally, each site will have a study coordinator.  
Each site will have identified a local retina specialist who will examine subjects immediately in 
case of ophthalmic symptoms following any injection or during follow -up visits.  
3.3 Training and certification on the  Perioral Rhytids Severity Rating Scale (PR -SRS)  
The study will use a validated 4-grade photonumeric scale  measuring the  severity of perioral 
rhytids . All assessors (i.e., TIs) will be certified on the use of the PR-SRS. Specifically, a ll 
assessors will be trained on the scale then tested  using a photo  booklet with a broad range of 
perioral rhytids severit ies. An assessor will be considered certified once his /her percentage of 
agreement with the true values is ≥80%.

4.1 Study Design  
This is a randomized, controlled, double -blinded, within -subject (split -face), multicenter, 
prospective study to investigate wh ether RHA® 1-M with MEPIVACAINE is non -inferior to  
RHA® 1 with lidocaine  in terms of injection site pain felt by the subject during injection . 
At screening, the Treating Investigator (TI) will evaluate subjects’ perioral rhytid severity (using 
the Perioral Rhytid Severity Rating Scale; PR -SRS) to confirm eligibility and to establish a pre -
treatment score for assessing aesthetic improvement.  
At Visit 1, RHA® 1-M with MEPIVACAINE will be administ ered in a random sequence (first or 
second injection) and side of the mouth  and RHA® 1 with lidocaine  will be administ ered to the 
other side. Study subjects and t he TI injecting  study devices  will be blinded . 
To minimize potential interference between the effect of the anesthetic agents of each study device, 
left and right perioral areas will be separated by a “no treatment zone” defined as the area between 
the philtral columns (approximately 8 mm). Si milarly, a no treatment zone of the lower perioral 
area will be defined as the ~8 mm area directly below the upper perioral no treatment zone  (See 
Section 7.2.4).  
The perioral area will be divided into 4 quadrants ( upper right, upper left, lower right, low er left ) 
and t he sequence of injections will be performed by quadrant  as follows:  
1. Inject upper right (or left) then immediately assess injection pain during injection;  
2. Inject upper left (or right) then immediately assess injection pain during injection;  
3. Inject lower right (or left) only if needed to improve cosmetic result s; 
4. Inject lower left (or right) only if needed to  improve cosmetic results . 
Immediately after injection of an upper perioral  quadrant, subjects will rate injection site pain 
experienced during injection  using a 100 mm Visual Analog Scale (VAS). Injection site pain in 
each side of the mouth will also be assessed at 15, 30, 45 and 60 minutes after the upper quadrant 
was injected.  
Additionally, subjects will assess anesthetic sensation, on each side of their mouth, every hour 
until normal sensation returns . Should the anesthetic effect continue into the following day, the 
subject , upon waking, will continue to assess the anesthetic sensation every hour until they return 
to normal sensation ; the time for return to normal sensation for each side will be recorded.  
Safety evaluation will consist of AE assessments , lip functionality assessments, visual 
assessments,  a 30-day CTR  diary, and a follow -up call performed by the study site at 72 hours 
after injection.  
Subjects will attend Visit 2 (30 days post-injection ) during which efficacy and safety assessments 
will be conducted. Subjects who present with an unresolved clinically significant device related 
AE at Visit 2 will receive the optional follow -up phone call no later than 30 days after Visit 2. If 
the clinically significant  AE remains unresolved, the Investigator will request that the subject 
attend the optional in-clinic follow -up visit (i.e., Visit 3) within 5 working days. Follow -up of the 
clinically significant AE will continue until the AE is resolved or the TI determin es that additional 
follow -up is not necessary.

treatment with a commercially available dermal filler approved for injection into the perioral 
rhytids if they present wrinkles/lines in the no -treatment zone.  
4.2 Study Design Rationale  
4.2.1 Study Population  
Maximum  30 subjects will be enrolled  and receive study treatment . The study population includes 
female and male subjects who are 22 years old.  Additionally, enrolment will be comprised of at 
least 20 % of subjects (i.e., 6 subjects) presenting Fitzpatrick skin types IV to VI including at least 
10% of subjects  (i.e., 3 subjects)  with Fitzpatrick  Skin Type V-VI. See Section 5 for a full 
description of the inclusion and exclusion criteria.  
4.2.2 Primary Endpoint  
The primary endpoint is injection site pain during  injection into the upper perioral rhytids assessed 
immediately following injection  with RHA® 1-M with MEPIVACAINE (using a 100 mm VAS) 
compared to the injection site pain felt during  injection  into the contralateral upper perioral rhytids 
assessed immediately following injection (s) with RHA® 1 with lidocaine .

All subjects who have signed an ICF will receive a 3-digit subject number, starting at 001. Subject 
numbers will be assigned in ascend ing order and will be coupled with the site identification number 
for unique identification of each subject. The subject number will be used to identify the subject 
throughout the study. Subjects withdrawn from the study will retain their subject number; n ew 
subjects will be allocated a new subject number.  
Upon qualifying for treatment, subjects will be randomized for the side of mouth and the order of 
injection of study devices (i.e., left or right / 1st or 2nd order).  If needed to improve cosmetic results , 
the lower perioral quadrant of a side will be injected only after both upper perioral quadrant s have 
been injected.  
Subjects will be considered “enrolled” at the time of consent, and will be considered “enrolled and 
randomized” at the time of rand omization . The required sample size is based on “enrolled and 
randomized” subjects . If an enrolled subject withdraws from the study prior to being randomized, 
he/she may be replaced.  
This is a double -blinded study  in which  subjects and TIs will be blinded to treatment allocation.  
Designated site personnel will secure the randomization/treatment allocation information and any 
other record of study treatment from potential discovery by the TI or the subject. Any instance 
where the blind is opened to t he TI or subject will be documented in writing.  
If it is medically imperative to know what device was injected into the left and right perioral 
rhytids , the TI or study coordinator will contact ethica CRO  to confirm the rationale for unblinding. 
If appropriate, ethica CRO  and/or the Sponsor will approve unblinding and treatment assignments 
for that particular subject  will be disclosed . The rationale for breaking the code must be recorded 
in subjects’ medic al record and eCRF.

7.1 Study Devices  
RHA® 1-M with MEPIVACAINE : A sterile, biodegradable, biocompatible, viscoelastic, clear, 
colorless, homogenized gel implant. It consists of cross -linked hyaluronic acid produced by 
fermentation of Streptococcus zooepidemicus , formulated to a concentration of 15 mg/g and 0.3% 
w/w MEPIVACAINE in a physiologic buffer . It is supplied in individual treatment syringes with 
30G ½ inch disposable sterile needles.  
RHA® 1 with lidocaine : A sterile, biodegradable, biocompatible, viscoelastic, clear, colorless, 
homogenized gel implant. It consists of cross -linked hyaluronic acid produced by fermentation 
of Streptococcus zooepidemicus , formulated to a concentration of 15 mg/g and 0.3% w/w 
lidocaine in a physiologic buffer . It is supplied in individual treatment syringes with 30G ½ inch 
disposable sterile needles.  
For additional information regarding  RHA 1-M, please refer to TEO -RHA -1801 Investigator’s 
Brochure.  
7.2 Injection of Study Devices  
At Visit 1, each enrolled and randomized subject will receive injections of RHA® 1-M with 
MEPIVACAINE into the perioral rhytids of the upper left quadrant  or the upper right quadrant , 
and injections of the control device (i.e., RHA® 1 with lidocaine) into the contralateral upper 
quadrant. Using the same device as the upper quadrant for that side, t he lower perioral quadrant of 
a side will be injected  only after both upper perioral quadrants have been injected  and only if 
needed . 
The st udy device s will not be injected in the “no treatment zone” as defined in Section 7.2.4 .  
7.2.1 Injection Depth  
Study devices will be administ ered into the dermis, including the superficial dermis , at the 
discretion of the TI.  
7.2.2 Injection Technique  
The injection technique (e.g., linear threading, cross hatching, fan like administration, multiple 
puncture, etc.)  will be at the discretion of the TI, and will be recorded. The same injection 
technique will be used on both sides of the mouth . While inject ing on either side of the mouth, 
using any of the techniques mentioned above, the needle should not cross or inject into the no 
treatment zone.  
For the purposes of this study, the lip will be defined as the structures within the vermilion border. 
The focus  of this study is to treat perioral rhytids, and there will be no augmentation of the lips, 
but the vermilion border may be treated to ensure a satisfactory result of the treatment of the 
perioral rhytids.  
Devices will be injected using the  needle that is provided within the standard packaging of the 
device; the TI is not permitted to use a needle of different gauge or length.  
7.2.3 Supplementary Anesthesia  
Both study devices contain an anesthetic . Additional anesthesia is prohibited (e.g., EMLA,  dental 
blocks, ice, etc.). Ice may be used at the discretion of the TI for post -injection treatment for pain 
or discomfort, but only after all injection pain assessment s for both sides of the mouth have been

7.2.4 No Treatment Zone  
In order to minimize potential interference between the anesthetic agents of each study device, left 
and right perioral areas will be separated by a “no treatment zone”. The no treatment zone of the 
upper perioral area w ill be defined as t he area between  the philtral columns ( approximately 8mm). 
Similarly, a no treatment zone of the lower perioral area will be defined as t he ~8mm area directly 
below the no treatment zone of the upper perioral area (see Figure 2 below).  
Optional treatment with a commercially available product approved for injection into the perioral 
rhytids will be offered to subjects at  study exit (i.e., at Visit 2 , optional follow -up phone call,  or 
Visit 3)  in order to provide correction within the no treatment zone  should the TI and subject agree  
it is desirable .

The subject will undergo three visual assessment tests to detect rare and unintentional injection 
into a blood vessel. Subjects should be instructed to wear the same corrective eyew ear (if 
applicable) at each visit.  
The following assessments will be performed by the TI, or an appropriately trained study 
coordinator, nurse practitioner, or physician assistant:  
• Snellen visual acuity  
• Confrontational visual fields tests  
• Ocular motility  
These visual assessments will be performed:  
• Prior to initial treatment  (to serve as Baseline)  
• 30 minutes post -injection  
• Visit 2  
• Visit 3 if the AE in question is a suspected vascular event  
7.2.6 Injection Sequence  
Using a non -permanent marker, divide the perioral area into 4 quadrants (i.e., upper right, upper 
left, lower right, lower left) , and delineate the “no -treatment zone” as defined in Section 7.2.4.  
Upon qualifying for treatment, s ubjects will be randomized for the side of mouth and the order of 
injection (i.e., left or right / 1st or 2nd order).  Both u pper perioral rhytids will be injected prior to 
injection of either lower perioral rhytid.  The sequence of injection s will be performed by quadrant  
as follows:  
1. Inject upper right (or left) then immediately assess injection pain during injection;  
2. Inject upp er left (or right) then immediately assess injection pain during injection;  
3. Inject lower right (or left) only if needed  improve cosmetic results ; 
4. Inject lower left (or right) only if needed  improve cosmetic results . 
7.2.7 Treatment Volume Allowance  
The maximum volume per administration of a study device into the perioral rhytids (upper and 
lower) is 6.0 mL (max 3.0 mL for right side, and max 3.0 mL for left side).  
7.3 Labeling, Packaging and Storage  
Supplies of RHA® 1-M with MEPIVACAINE and RHA® 1 with lidocaine  will be provided to the 
sites in bulk (i.e., individual kits per subject will not be provided) . External packaging  (carton)  will 
be labeled with study information (i.e., study number, study Sponsor, name and address of 
TEOXANE , quantity, “CAUTION: Investigational device . Limited by US Federal law to

The Investigator Brochure will provide all relevant contraindications, hazards, adverse effects, 
warnings and precautions.  
The study device is to be stored at room temperature ( 2C to 25C) in a secure restricted area. 
7.3.1 Relabeling  
Real-time aging testing is in progress for  the study devices . As new test data will become available 
throughout the course of the study, the shelf life of the study devices  may be extended through the 
course of the study.  The si te monitor  and/or study coordinator  will be responsible for relabeling 
the Tyvek lid  with the new expiry date.  The site monitor and/or study coordinator will follow a 
specific procedure to perform and verify the product relabeling with the extended expiry date  (to 
be provided in a separate guidance document) . The relabeling process will be documented.  The 
study devices  may also be returned to the Sponsor to be relabeled . When the study devices  have 
reached the expiry date as indicated on its label, t he TI should segregate them and follow the 
instructions from the site monitor as to relabeling by the site monitor and/or study coordinator or 
for returning the devices to the Sponsor.   
It is the responsibility of the TI to verify that a device is within its expiry date before being used.  
The initial shelf life of the study devices  will be approximately 9 months ; however, as devices 
being subjected to real time aging are being tested periodically, the shelf -life could be extended . 
7.4 Study Device Supply and Accountability  
The study Sponsor will ensure that participating sites are provided with a sufficient supply of study 
devices for all treatments.  It is forbidden to use a study device for purposes other than defined in 
this protocol.  Syringes are single use and must not b e shared between subjects.  
Study devices must be kept in a locked area with access restricted to designated study personnel. 
The Principal Investigator or design ee will inventory and acknowledge receipt of all study device 
shipments , and ensure that the in tegrity of study devices is not jeopardized prior to use.   
Accurate accountability records will be maintained that include batch numbers, quantities 
received/returned/destroyed, as well as dates and volumes administered , and the site monitor will 
be provid ed access to the study devices and records for periodic review.  
Unused syringes  will be returned to the Sponsor at the end of the study unless other arrangements 
are agreed upon in writing. Used syringes  will be  destroyed as per each site’s standard procedures.  
7.4.1 Other Study Supplies  
Supplies that are unique to th e study will be provided by ethica CRO  (e.g., UPTs, photographic 
equipment, paper study diaries, source document worksheets, etc.). The  site is responsible for 
routine supplies related  to pre -/post-injection  care (e.g., alcohol wipes, gauze , etc.).  
7.5 Concomitant Medications and Procedures  
Any medication or procedure, including over -the-counter preparations, that the subject takes 
during the study protocol period is considered concomitant medication and will be captured on the 
Concomitant Medi cations  and Procedures  page of the eCRF.  
7.5.1 Prohibited Treatment  and Procedures

steroidal anti -inflammatory, anticoagulant, high-dose Vitamin E, fish oil , 
corticosteroids ) 
• Additional anesthesia during injections is prohibited (e.g., EMLA, dental 
blocks, ice, etc. ). Ice may be used at the discretion of the TI for post -
injection treatment for pain or discomfort, but only after all injection pain 
assessments for both sides of the mouth have been completed (i.e., at 60 
minutes post -injection).  ≥14 days before treatment  
Additionally, subjects should be advised to not use make -up below the infraorbital rim prior to 
study visits, or during the 12 hours following injection and to avoid extreme temperatures (intense 
cold, sauna, ham mam, etc.) during the week following treatment.  
Subjects will be instructed to not use laser hair removal around the lip during study. Additionally, 
subjects will be instructed to not use any hair removal products around the lip (e.g. waxing, 
bleaching, hair removal creams) for 7 da ys before a study treatment and  until V2 is complete.   
All treatment/procedures received by the subject within 30 days prior to the Baseline visit and 
throughout the treatment period, including the name of the treatment/ procedure, must be recorded 
in the eCRF with end dates, if applicable. Use of prohibited treatment/procedures must be recorded 
in the eCRF up to the extent of the prohibited tim e period indicated above.  Furthermore, previous 
use of facial aesthetic treatment/procedures must be recorded for up to 1 year prior to the Baseline 
visit.  
In the event such prohibited therapies are administered during the study period, the Medical 
Monitor  will be contacted to discuss the details of the event. Subject participation will not 
automatically be discontinued. At a minimum, the event will be documented by the site staff as a 
protocol deviation, as instructed by the Medical Monitor . Depending upon  the nature of the 
prohibited therapy and the timing relative to the determination of the primary endpoint, the 
Medical Monitor  may make a decision to discontinue the subject.

Treatment and follow -up of subjects will be recorded in a 21 CFR part 11 compliant eCRF.  Data 
will be first recorded in to the medical record and  study specific source document worksheets prior 
to entry into the eCRF.  The study c oordinator will refer to these worksheets in conjunction with 
the medical record in order to complete data entry into the eCRF.  
In order to review and electronically sign the eCRF, the T I will have an individual login  password 
that will al low them to view only the data that they have  generated.  The TI must ensure that they 
electronically sign for completed eCRF s on a timely basis.  
8.2 Subject Diar ies 
Subjects will record Common Treatment Responses (CTRs) for 30 days post-injection  using 
paper -based diaries. Data recorded in th is diary will be entered into the eCRF by the study 
coordinator.  
The CTR diary will also record the occurrence of any visual disturbances (including, but not 
limited to: any loss of vision, blurriness , double vision, pain in or around the eye, blindness, blind 
spot or shadow in the visual field, trouble moving eyes, etc.). Subjects will be inst ructed to report  
immediately  such events to the investigational site or to their health care practitioner.  
Subjects will also record “duration of  anesthetic effect” using paper -based diaries. Data recorded 
in this diary will be entered into the eCRF by the study coordinator.

Ruler (see Figure 3 below) . The VAS  Pain Scale Ruler has two sides . Using the side that shows 
faces and is labeled “Pain Assessment Tool”, subjects will move the slider to the location that 
represent s their level of pain. The site will use the other side  of the ruler  to determine the VAS 
score  (expressed in units of mm ). 
Figure 3.  VAS Ruler  
 
Immediately after injection  of an upper perioral  quadrant, subjects will rate injection site pain 
during injection . Injection site pain in each side of the mouth will also be assessed at 15, 30, 45 
and 60 minutes after the upper quadrant for that side was injected.  
The occurrence of injection site pain is not to be considered an AE unless it is in excess to that 
typically observed following injection of a dermal filler  (as determined by the TI ). 
9.3.1.2  Duration of Anesthetic Effect  
Subject s will complete a self-assessment of the duration of anesthetic  effect on each side of the 
mouth (right and left , every hour until returning to normal  sensation ) using a paper -based diary . 
The subject will respond  to the following question in their diary regarding the treatment on the left 
side and the right  side of their mouth : “Indicate the time at which you evaluate sensation and check 
the box to report if you still feel numbness (i.e., "YES" or "NO"). ” 
Subject s who  go to sleep prior to returning to normal  sensation  will re -assess anesthetic effect 
upon waking . If the anesthetic effect is absent upon waking, subjects should use the time they 
woke as the time anesthetic effect returned to normal.

Additionally, total volume required injected in each lower quadrant will be collected. Treatment 
volume will be measured to an accuracy of 0.1 mL.  
9.4 Safety  
Safet y will be evaluated through a 30-day patient Common Treatment Response ( CTR ) diary that 
captures post-injection signs/symptoms  and A E reporting  based on phone follow -ups and clinic 
visits . Safety assessment s will also include lip functionality tests performed at Visit 1 (pre and 
post-injection) and at Visit 2 as well as visual assessment tests performed at Visit 1 (before and 30 
minutes post -injection , including referral to a retina specialist i f a visual disturbance is noted p ost 
injection ), Visit 2, and at Visit 3 (if the unresolved AE is related to a vascular event).  
9.4.1 30-Day Patient Common Treatment Response Diary  
The subject will receive a diary booklet and instructions for recording his/her observations of the 
CTRs of the study treatments for the first 30 days after treatment . The diary will be dispensed  after 
treatment and will be discussed during the 72 -hour post -injection telephone follow -up. Subjects 
should complete the diary at approximately the same time each d ay (i.e., AM or PM ). 
The subject diary will capture the following CTRs  that typically occur following the injection of a 
dermal filler; specifically, redness, pain, tenderness, firmness, swelling, lumps/bumps, bruising, 
itching, discoloration , and “other” . Subjects will record the presence and the severity of each 
observed sign/symptom as: none, mild, moderate, or severe.  
In addition, the CTR diary will capture the occurrence of the following AEs:  
• Visual Disturbance (loss of vision, blurriness, dou ble vision, pain in or around the eye, 
blindness, blind spots, shadow in visual field, problems moving eyes)  
• Skin changing color around eyelids  
• Crusty or scabby skin around eyelids  
• Headache  
• Fever  
• Dizziness  
• Confusion  
• Weakness/numbness in arms or legs  
• Change s to consciousness  or alertness  
• Difficulty speaking/speech impairment  
• Face droop  
• Changes to chewing and drinking  
• Chest discomfort with irregular heart beat   
• Sensitivity to hot/cold liquids and foods  
The 30-day patient CTR  diary  will capture the daily occurrence of each CTR . The 30-day patient 
CTR diary will include a detailed glossary describing all signs/symptoms listed in the diary.  
9.4.2 72-Hour Telephone Follow -up 
The subject will be contacted by telephone by the investigational s ite approximately 72 hours 
following study injections and will be queried regarding health status and AEs. Information 
gathered will be documented in the progress notes and upon confirmation at the next clinic visit, 
data will be entered into the eCRF.  The investigational site  must attempt at least twice to contact

9.4.3 Lip Functionality  
Lip functionality testing will be conducted by the TI or study coordinator pre- and post -injection 
and at each follow -up visit . The lip functionality testing will include the following Yes/No 
evaluations:  
• Lip function: Ability to suck liquid through a straw. TI or study coordinator will be asked 
to capture Yes or No with the following question : “Can the subject drink/suck through a 
straw effectively?”  
• Lip Sensation: Ability to feel the change in the lip sensation to touch, using the two 
following tests:  
1) the monofilament test (i.e., a subject’s ability to feel the sensation of a 0.4G 
monofilament at three points on each the left and right upper lip and three points on 
each the left and right lower lip) and  
2) the cotton wisp test (i.e., a subject’s abi lity to feel the sensation of a cotton wisp at 
three points on each the left and right upper lip and three points on each the left and 
right lower lip).  
The 6 different points on each side of the mouth will be randomly tested for each of the 
two tests. Sub jects will wear a blindfold and will be asked to acknowledge sensation at 
each of the points by answering Yes or No.  
• Lip Movement: Ability to pronounce specific letters and words. TI or study coordinator 
will be asked to capture Yes or No with the followin g question: “Can the subject effectively 
pronounce the following words?”  
o Member, Simmering, Drab, Babble, Spear, Peep, Fire, Staff, Verse, Liver  
9.4.4 Visual Assessments  
Subjects will undergo three visual assessment tests to detect rare and unintentional injection into 
a blood vessel. The following assessments will be performed by the TI, or an appropriately trained 
study coordinator, nurse practitioner, or physician assistant:  
• Snellen visual acuity  
• Confrontational visual fields tests  
• Ocular motility  
9.4.5 Pregnancy  and Contraception  
A female of childbearing potential must present a negative UPT prior to injection of the study 
device. Subjects who are pregnant are excluded from the study.  
Female subjects of childbearing potential are expected  to prevent pregnancy occurring whilst on 
treatment by using effective birth control methods (e.g., oral contraceptive, condom, IUD, 
injectable contraceptive,  diaphragm  or vasectomized partner ). Male subjects have no contraceptive 
restrictions.  
9.4.6 Adverse Events 
All observed or volunteered AEs regardless of treatment group or suspected causal relationship to

CONFIDENTIAL  
v.1.5; 10 -Sep-2019                        Page 38 of 57 the study device (s) will be recorded in the eCRF . Subjects  will be questioned for the occurrence 
of any new or worsening signs or symptoms at each visit by the following methods:  
• Information volunteered by the subject  
• Open ended and non -leading questions such as: Have you had any health problems since 
your last visit?  
• Observation by the investigational team, other care providers or relatives  
9.4.6.1  Definiti on of an Adverse Event  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject administered the study device and which 
may, but does not necessarily , have a causal relationship with th e device . An AE can therefore be 
any unfavorable  or unintended sign (for example an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom or 
disease temporally associated with the use the study device, whether or not considered related to 
that device . 
AEs may include, but are not limited to, subjective or objective symptoms spontaneously offered 
by the subject, solicited via the diary and subject interviews, uncovered by review of concomitant 
medications or therapies, and/or observed by the study site staff . The TI will determine the 
description (sign, symptom, or diagnosis), onset, resolution, seriousness, severity, cause and action 
taken for any event .  
CTRs will not be considered A Es unless the duration and/or severity exceed what is typically 
observed fo llowing injection of a dermal filler, and are clinically significant as determined by the 
TI. CTRs will be reviewed by TI to ensure that CTRs are elevated to the status of an AE as 
appropriate , and will determine AE severity and the relationship to the stu dy devices . CTRs that 
are present on day 30 o f the diary (or on the last recorded day of the diary) will by default be 
elevated to the status of an AE, regardless of TI assessment . 
Disease signs and symptoms that existed prior to the study injections are not considered AEs. 
Recurring symptoms associat ed with pre -existing conditions are not considered AEs unless they 
have a clinically significant increase in severity and/or frequency , as determined by the TI . 
Clinically significant a bnormal laboratory tests (if applicable) must be recorded as an AE.  
Changes resulting from normal growth and/or development occurring at a physiologically 
appropriate time that do not vary significantly from the frequency or severity expected, for 
example , the onset of menses or menopause, are not to be considered AEs. 
9.4.7 Vascul ar Occlusion Adverse Events  
When vascular occlusion involves vessels of the eye, the event should be handled as a medical 
emergency. The injection should be stopped at once and the patient should be transferred to a  
previously identified retina specialist .  
Symptoms may include unilateral vision loss, ocular pain, headache, nausea/vomiting, lack of 
extraocular movement, ptosis, and exotropia ( one or both eyes deviate outward).   
Treatment varies from observation to di gital massage, intraocular pressure -lowering agents such 
as acetazolamide and mannitol, IV methylprednisolone, oral corticosteroids, oxygen and carbon 
dioxide therapy, antibiotics, mechanical and chemical thrombolysis, anterior chamber 
paracentesis, or ant icoagulants.

A SAE  is defined as any unfavorable medical occurrence that meets any of the following:  
1. Results in death . 
2. Is life -threatening:  “Life-threatening” refers to an event in which the subject was at risk of 
death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event, which hypothetically might have 
caused death if it were more severe . 
3. Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization:  Planned and 
routine hospital admissions for pre -existing conditions are not considered SAEs and do not 
require reporting as an AE unless the condition has worsened beyond what would reasonably 
be expected for that subject. If a subject experiences an additio nal AE that prolongs a pre -
planned hospitalization this is considered to be an SAE and should be reported as an SAE. 
Pre-planned admissions must be recorded in the subject’s source documentation.  
4. Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity . 
5. Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect  resulting from a pregnancy that occurred during the 
study . 
6. Is an important medical event:  Important medical events that may not be immediately life -
threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the subject or may require 
intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed above should usually be considered 
serious.  
A UADE  is defined as any device -related AE that meets any of the following:  
1. Is not identified in nature, severity or frequency in current literature on the product . 
2. Is life threatening, even if temporary in nature . 
3. Results in permanent impairment of a body function or permanent damage to a body structure . 
4. Necessitates medical or surgical  intervention to preclude permanent impairment of a body 
function or permanent damage to a body structure . 
5. Any device malfunction that would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury 
if the malfunction were to recur.  
9.4.9 Causality Assessmen t 
The TI’s assessment of an AE ’s relationship to the study device is part of the documentation 
process, but it is not a factor in determining what is or is not reported in the study. If there is any 
doubt as to whether a clinical observation is an AE, the event will be reported. The TI will assign 
the causality assessment according to his/her clinical experience  and the subject’s description of 
the event . The Sponsor will be responsible for the final causality judgment . The causal relationship 
should be classified according to the following criteria (not all variables need to be present to be 
indicative of relationship to the device):  
Definitely related : 
• The temporal sequence of AE onset relative to injection of study device is reasonable . 
• The AE is more likely explained by the study device or procedure than by another cause . 
• The AE shows a pattern consistent with previous knowledge of the study device . 
Probably related : 
• The temporal sequence of AE onset relative to injection of study device is reasonable .

Possibly related:  
• The temporal sequence of AE onset relative to injection of study device is reasonable . 
• The AE could have been due to another equally likely cause . 
Probably not related : 
• There is another more likely cause of the AE.  
Definitely not related : 
• The temporal sequ ence of AE onset relative to injection of study device is not reasonable . 
• There is another obvious cause of the AE . 
9.4.10  Severity Assessment  
For events reported on the AE eCRF, the TI will determine the severity classification based on 
his/her clinical experience and by using the following definitions of severity (n ote: a “severe” AE 
is not the same as a  SAE):  
• Mild:  Symptoms are barely noticeable or do not make the subject uncomfortable . The AE 
does not influence performance or functioning. Prescription drugs are not ordinarily needed 
for relief of symptom(s).  
• Moderate: Symptoms are of sufficient severity to make the subject uncomfortable. 
Performance of daily activities is influenced. T reatment of symptom(s) with prescription 
drugs or therapies may be needed.  
• Severe:  Symptoms are of sufficient severity to cause the subject severe discomfort. 
Performance of daily activities is compromised. Treatment for symptom(s) with prescription 
drugs or therapies may be needed.  
The maximal severity for the AE will be recorded, even if the AE presented as being less severe 
at some point during the event.  
9.4.11  Adverse Event Reporting  
9.4.11.1  All Adverse Events  
All AEs, whether serious or not, will be re corded from the time of informed consent until the last 
study visit, or until  30 days following the study treatment. The TI will assess all AEs and record 
details of seriousness, severity, duration, and action  taken with study device, and relationship to 
the stud y device.  
If an AE occurs, the first concern will be the safety of the study participants. All Device Related 
AEs occurring after study device administration will be followed until the event has resolved or 
stabilized or until follow -up is no longer possib le or the TI deems it unnecessary . 
The Sponsor is responsible for reporting AEs to the relevant governing authorities in the time 
frame applicable according to international and local law.  
9.4.11.2  Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) and Unexpected Adverse Device Effects  (UADEs)  
All SAEs and UADEs that occur after the time of informed consent through 7 days after subject 
completion of the study, or within 30 days following the study treatment, must be reported to ethica 
CRO within 24 hours of awareness . Initial reports must be made by contacting ethica CRO  as per 
the following:  Contact the ethica CRO  Clinical Project Manager  by telephone  and complete the

if unable to contact the ethica CRO  Clinical Project Manager , use the 2 4-hour number (514-262-
9398 ). It is the  site’s responsibility to perform the following:  
• Obtain and maintain all pertinent medical records, information, an d medical judgments from 
colleagues who assisted in the treatment and follow -up of the subject.  
• Provide ethica CRO  with a complete, written case history, including copies of supporting 
reports (e.g., progress notes, laboratory reports) and a statement as to whether the event was 
or was not related to the use of the study device.  
• With the assistance of ethica CRO , notify the governing IRB of the SAE or UADE in 
accordance with the requirements of SAE reporting stipulated by the governing IRB.  
Reporting Timelines  
UADEs:  The site must report UADE s to ethica CRO  within 24 hours of awareness of the event.  
Within 24 hours of receiving the UADE report from the site, ethica CRO  must report the UADE 
to the Sponsor . As per 21 CFR 812.46  (US) , the Sponsor must investigate the UADE and report 
the results to the FDA  and IRB within 10 working days of receiving the r eport from ethica CRO . 
• SAEs:  The site must report the SAE to the ethica CRO  within 24 hours of becoming aware 
of the event.  Within 24 hours of receiving the SAE report from the site, ethica CRO  must 
report the SAE to the Sponsor . Sponsor must investigate the SAE and , if it is device related, 
will report the results to the FDA and IRB within 10 working day s of receiving the report 
from ethica CRO . 
Study Hold Due to UADEs  
• If the Medical Monitor  determines that an UADE(s) presents an unreasonable risk to 
subjects, the Sponsor shal l put on hold all investigation or parts of investigations presenting 
that risk as soon as possible. The study hold shall occur no later than 5 working days after 
the Sp onsor makes this determination and not later than 15 working days after the Sponsor 
first received notice of the effect. The Sponsor will not resume a n on hold  investigation 
without IRB  and FDA approval.  
9.4.11.3  Reporting of Adverse Events Associated with Visual D isturbances  
One of the rare risks of dermal fillers is the unintentional injection into a blood vessel which may 
lead to stroke or blindness. The actual risk is unknown; however, the perioral rhytid area is highly 
vascularized. Therefore, any incidence of visual disturbance should be reported as follows:  
• Any incidence of visual disturbances  (including, but not limited to: any loss of vision, 
blurriness , double vision, pain in or around the eye, blindness, blind spot or shadow in the 
visual field, trouble moving eyes, etc.) should be reported to ethica CRO within 24 hours 
of becoming aware of the event. The report must include depth of injection, injection 
volume, symptoms that were observed, time to onset, time to resolution and any 
intervention(s) that were implemented. Within 24 hours of receiving the report of this 
category of AE, ethica CRO must report the event to the Sponsor  and the IRB(s) .  
• Sponsor must investigate the AE and report the results to FDA  within 10 working days of 
receiving the report from ethica CRO.

10.1 Completion  
A subject will be considered to have completed the study if he or she has completed all the 
assessments or has experienced an event that precludes further participation in the study.  
10.2 Withdrawal  
A subject will be  withdrawn from the study for any of the following reasons:  
- Lost to follow -up; 
- Withdrawal of consent;  
- The Principal Investigator believes that for safety reasons (e.g. , AE, concurrent illness) that 
it is in the best interests of the subject to be withdrawn from study participation;  
- The sub ject’s attending physician requests that the subject be withdrawn from the study;  
- The Principal Investigator or the Sponsor, for any reason, stops the study or stops the 
subject’s participation in the study.  
Protocol deviations will not lead to automatic withdrawal unless they indicate a significant risk to 
the subject’s safety. All major protocol deviations must be discussed promptly with the Medical 
Monitor . 
A subject may be  withdrawn from the study, in consultation with the Medical Monitor , for any of 
the following reasons:  
- Lack of compliance to study procedures;  
- A significant protocol deviation or violation;  
- Poor visit attendance.  
Should a subject decide to withdraw after a dministration of a study device(s), or should the 
Principal Investigator decide to withdraw the subject, the Principal Investigator (or designate) will 
complete and report the observations up to the time of withdrawal.  
All subjects who are withdrawn from t he study will be requested to come in to complete their next 
scheduled clinic  visit. The next scheduled visit may be brought forward to facilitate this. A 
complete evaluation at the time of the subject ’s withdrawal should be made.  Additionally, subjects 
who withdraw from the study will be requested to allow continued safety monitoring , either via 
telephone interviews  or clinic visits, whichever is more appropriate.  
The reason and date of withdrawal must be noted on the eCRF. If the reason for withdrawal is an 
AE or an abnormal laboratory test result, monitoring will continue until resolution or until an 
appropriate medical judgment concerning the cause or importance has been made. The specific 
event or test result(s) must be recorded on the eCR F. 
10.3 Stopping Rules  
In the case of the following SAE occurring, patient enrollment and treatment of subjects at that 
site will be suspended until a root -cause investigation (including the Medical Monitor 
consultation), is performed:  
• Vascular embolic event le ading to skin necrosis, any clinically significant change in vision  
and/or stroke.

protocol), the study may resume after appropriate corrective actions have  been successfully 
implemented (e.g., retraining of the TI or change of the TI).  
If the cause of the event was unanticipated, the entire study must  be immediately suspended, and 
subject enrolment and/or treatment will be stopped. The study will remain on -hold until the event 
can be properly characterized and an appropriate treatment strategy to avoid this unanticipated 
event be devised.  
In case of a UADE, the TI will follow the procedure as noted in Section 9.4. 11.2. The study may 
resume if the underlying p roblem can be addressed and the safety of subjects can be ensured. The 
IRB(s) will be notified if the study is stopped, and permission to resume the study will be obtained 
from the FDA and IRB prior to restarting  as described in Section 9.4. 11.2.

11.1 Primary Endpoint  
The primary endpoint will be the i njection site pain felt during  injection of the upper perioral 
quadrants assessed by the subject immediately following injection with RHA® 1-M with 
MEPIVACAINE , compared to the injection site pain felt during  injection of the contralateral upper 
perioral quadrant assessed immediately following injection with RHA® 1 with lidocaine.  
The effectiveness of RHA® 1-M with MEPIVACAINE will be demonstrated if the injectio n site 
pain during  injection of the upper perioral quadrant assessed by subject s immediately following 
injection with RHA® 1-M with MEPIVACAINE is statistically non -inferior to the injection site 
pain felt during  injection of the contralateral upper perioral quadrant assessed  by subject s 
immediately following injection with RHA® 1 with lidocaine.  
The primary endpoint will use a paired design and wil l be analyzed using hypothesis test.  
For achieving non -inferiority, the observed p value must be ≤0.05, taking account of the non -
inferiority margin.  
In case of non-inferiority, for achieving superiority of RHA® 1-M with MEPIVACAINE over 
RHA® 1 with lidocaine  in terms of reducing pain , the observed p -value must be ≤0.05.  
11.2 Secondary Endpoints  
The following secondary effectiveness  endpoints will be explored:  
1) Injection Site Pain in each side of the mouth  at 15, 30, 45 and 60 minutes after the upper  
quadrant  was injected.  
2) Duration of anesthetic effect in each side of the mouth, as assessed by subjects, commencing 
after the time of the final Injection Site Pain assessment s (i.e., at 60 minutes post -injection) . 
3) Perioral Rhytids Rating Scale ( PR-SRS)  of each side of the mouth , as assessed by the TI at 
Visit 1 (pre - and post-injection) and at Visit 2 on a subjective 4-grade scale comprised of 
“absent, mild, moderate, and severe”.  
4) Perioral Rhytids domain of the validated FACE -Q scale, as assessed by  the subject at Visit 1 
(pre-injection) and at Visit 2 . Each side of the mouth will be assessed independently.  
5) Global aesthetic improvement (GAI)  on each side of the mouth , as assessed by the TI at Visit 
1 (post -injection) and at Visit 2, on a subjective 5 -grade scale comprised of “much improved, 
improved, no change, worse, and much worse”.

The following safety endpoints will be explored:  
1) Occurrence of Common Treatment Responses (CTRs)  
2) Occurrence of Adverse Events (AEs)  
3) Lip functionality testing  
4) Visual assessments  
11.4 Analysis Populations  
Three subject analysis populations are defined: Intent -to-Treat (ITT) Population, Per Protocol (PP) 
Populat ion, and Safety (SAFT) Population. All analysis populations will be defined and 
determined prior to database closure and unblinding for the final analysis.   
11.4.1  Intent -to-Treat (ITT) Population  
The ITT Population will consist of all subjects that were randomized. The ITT principle will be 
followed in that subjects will be analyzed according to the treatment assigned to each side of the 
mouth  as per the randomization schedule . Furthermore, all sub jects in the ITT Population will be 
included in the analysis, regardless if they have missing data at the time point of interest. The ITT 
Population will be the primary population used for effectiveness  analyses.  
11.4.2  Per Protocol (PP) Population  
The PP Populat ion will consist of all study subjects who, 1) met all inclusion/exclusion criteria , 2) 
successfully completed  assessments of injection site pain felt during injection (i.e., recorded at 
Visit 1 immediately after injection(s) of each upper perioral region , and 3) who experienced no 
major protocol violations/deviations that could affect assessments of injection site pain felt during 
injection . Subjects will be analyzed according to the treatment actually received on each side of 
the mouth . 
The decision whether a protocol violation/deviation results in the exclusion of subjects from the 
PP Population will be made prior to breaking the study blind in a data review meeting.  
11.4.3  Safety (SAFT) Population  
The SAFT Population will consist of all study subjects that were randomized and received 
treatment with the study device.  
11.5 Sample Size Considerations  
Using a balance ratio, a  minimum  sample size of 10 subjects who will receive RHA®1-M with 
MEPIVACAINE on one side, and the control device on the other side, are required to detect a 
10mm non -inferiority with a power of 80%. As the primary endpoint will be assessed at the first 
study visit, no drop -outs are anticipated.  The estimated number of subjects needed  was computed 
using the following assumptions:  
• A unilateral approach  
• A first level risk α = 0.05  
• A standard deviation S = 19.74 (*) 
• A non -inferiority margin –Δ = 10  
• A left -right correlation r = 0. 83306 (**) 
• Balanced groups

v.1.5; 10 -Sep-2019                        Page 47 of 57 • No lost to follow -up anticipated  as the primary endpoint (i.e., injection pain) occurs 
during the initial study visit  
(*) Standard deviation  of pain was determined using data from the ongoing TEO -RHA -1501 clinical study of RHA® Redensity  (i.e., 
RHA®1, with lidocaine) for the treatment of perioral rhytids , during first injection (G160123) . 
(**) Correlation of pain felt during injection between sides was determined using data from split -face TEO -RHA -1302 and TEO -
RHA -1402 clinical studies of RHA® Global Action, RHA Deep Lines, and RHA Ultra Deep (aka RHA®2, RHA®3, and RHA®4, 
respectively, with lidocaine) for the treatment of nasolabial folds, at all timepoints ( G140028 and G140106 ). Data from G160123 
were not applicable as  1) it was a not a split -face design , and 2) it used  a no-treatment control group.  
Due to the small number of subjects needed according to this simulation and the variability in 
human pain tolerance, the Sponsor increased the sample size to 30 subjects . 
11.6 General Considerations  
Data will  be listed by treatment group and subject number. The safety and efficacy data will be 
summarized by treatment allocation. Descriptive statistics will consist of  mean, standard deviation, 
minimum and maximum for continuous variables, and frequency and perc ent for discrete 
variables.  
A full description of the statistical methods planned for this study will be provided in the Statistical 
Analysis Plan (SAP). The SAP will be finalized and approved by the study Sponsor prior to the 
last subject’s last visit. All programs for data output and analyses will be written in SAS version 
9.4 or higher (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC).  
Missing Values  
There will be no data imputation  performed for missing data. A nalyses will utilize available data 
as observed.  
Discontinuation and Drop -Outs  
Dropouts will not be replaced. All available data from dropouts will be included in the ITT 
analysis.  Subject disposition will be summarizing the number of subjects enrolled in  the study and 
those that discontinued the study and their reason.  
Interim Analysis  
There will be no interim effectiveness  analysis.  
11.7 Effectiveness  Analysis  
11.7.1  Primary Endpoint  
Effectiveness  of RHA® 1-M with MEPIVACAINE versus  control will first be analyzed in a non -
inferiority statistical model using the pain felt by the subject during injection. If non -inferiority is 
achieved, pain felt by the subject during injection will be tested for superiority  (i.e., t o confirm if 
RHA® 1-M is superior to RHA® 1 for reducing pain).  
The primary endpoint will use a paired -design and will be analyzed using a one -sided parametric 
or non -parametric test for paired data, as appropriate.  Due to the small sample size, n ormality of 
the observed dis tribution will be visually confirmed. If data appear normally distributed, testing 
will be conducted using the Student t -test, while testing will be conducted with the Wilcoxon  
signed -rank test if not normally distributed.  
A difference of 10mm between the two treatment groups will be used as the non -inferiority margin, 
as half of the clinically significant difference of pain felt by a subject on a 100 mm VAS pain scale ,

11.7.2  Secondary Endpoints  
Secondary endpoint statistical analysis will be performed if the non -inferiority of the primary 
endpoint is achieved. All statistical inference tests will be performed at the same significance level 
(α) of 0.05.  For categorical and continuous variables, th e two groups will be compared using two -
sided parametric or non -parametric tests for paired data, as appropriate.  Due to the small sample 
size, n ormality of the observed distribution will be visually confirmed. If data appear normally 
distributed, testing will be conducted using the Student t -test, while testing will be conducted with 
the Wilcoxon  signed -rank test if not normally distributed.  
11.8 Safety Analysis  
The SAFT P opulation will be used to summarize the safety of  the study devices and will consist 
of all treated subjects. The primary safety analysis is the calculation of the incidence of CTRs and 
adverse events in the study period . Point estimates for all CTRs, AEs and SAEs will be presented 
and two -sided exact 95% confidence interv als will be calculated for the overall incidence of AEs 
and SAEs . Tables will be generated which summarize AEs by investigator assessments of both 
relationship to treatment and severity.  
11.8.1  Adverse Events (A Es) 
Safety outcomes will be incidence rate of A Es, including UADEs, types of AEs and their 
relationship to study treatment . Severity and relationship to study treatment will be assessed  and 
recorded.  
AEs will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) dictionary. 
These events, irrespective of relationship to study medication, will be summarized by MedDRA 
system organ class  (SOC)  and MedDRA preferred term  (PT). The number of subjects reporting an 
AE, the number of A Es, and percentages of subjects in each category will be summarized. A Es by 
severity and relationship to study will be summarized in a similar way. Serious A Es will be 
summarized separately.  Specifically, t he following AE incidence tables will be provided:  
• All and possibly * related A Es sorted by SOC  
• All and poss ibly* related A Es sorted by decreasing frequency  
• SAEs: All and possibly * related SAEs sorted by seriousness criterion  
• SAEs: All and possibly * related SAEs sorted by SOC  
• UADEs: All and possibly * related  UADEs  sorted by SOC  
• Death: All and possibly * related  deaths  sorted by SOC  
* definitely probably, possibly  
Incidence rates with two -sided exact 95% confidence intervals will be calculated for the overall 
incidence of AEs and SAEs  
Statistical analysis will also be performed to evaluate the potential i mpact of the injection 
technique on the safety data.

13.1 Protocol Amendments  
No amendments to the protocol will be implemented without the prior written consent of the 
Sponsor. Should an amendment be necessary, the reviewing IRB  and FDA may require review 
and approv al prior to its implementation.  
13.2 Monitoring and Quality Assurance  
13.2.1  Information to Study Personnel  
The Principal Investigator , with the assistance of ethica CRO , is responsible for ensuring that all 
study personnel are qualified for their designated roles and for provid ing information about the 
study to all staff members involved in the study or in any element of subject management, both 
before starting the practi cal performance of the study and during the course of the study (e.g. , when 
new staff become involved).  
The ethica CRO  site monitor is responsible for initiating the site, conducting interim monitoring 
visits, ensuring site compliance with the protocol and  closing out the site at the end of the study. 
Additional information available during the study should be given as agreed upon, either by the 
Principal Investigator or the site monitor, and always when new staff members become involved 
in the study.  
13.2.2  Study  Monitoring  
ethica CRO  clinical monitors will conduct approximately two interim monitoring visits at each 
study site in order to ensure compliance to the protocol , applicable regulations,  and ICH-GCP, and 
to ensure safety of the subjects  and maintenance of adequate and accurate clinical records.  
Monitoring functions will be performed in compliance with recognized GCP  and as per the study 
specific Monitoring Plan . The Principal Investigator agrees to allow the site monitors, and other 
authorized Sponsor personnel, access to the clinical supplies, the investigational agent dispensing 
and storage area, subject medical records, laboratory data, and other source documentation of the 
study subjects.  Approximately  two on-site interim monitoring visits will be conducted at each site, 
and a dedicated close -out visit will also be conducted at each site.  
Source Document worksheets for all  subjects and eCRFs  will be reviewed in detail by the site 
monitor to ensure data integ rity. If errors or omissions are found in the course of a data audit, or if 
clarification of data is required, the eCRFs and/or worksheets in question will be corrected by the 
study coordinator and confirmed /signed for by the TI, as appropriate . Data clarification or query 
forms may be generated for omissions or clarifications, to be completed and returned to the site 
monitor.  
The dates of monitoring visits will be recorded by the site monitor in a sign -in log to be kept at the 
site. The Sponsor expect s that, during monitoring visits, the study coordinator and Principal 
Investigator will be available, the source documentation will be available, and a suitable 
environment will be provided for review of study -related documents.  
The TI and assisting staff must agree to cooperate with the site monitor to resolve any problems, 
errors, or possible misunderstandings concerning any data discrepancies detected in the course of 
these monitoring visits.  
As part of the supervision of the study progress other Sponsor  personnel may accompany the site 
monitor on visits to the study site.

According to ICH Guidelines on GCP, the Sponsor (or its designate) may audit the investigational 
site to compare raw data, source data, and associated records with the interim (if applicable) or 
final report of the study to assure that data have been accurately reported  
The Principal Investigator must accept that regulatory authorities may conduct an inspection to 
verify compliance of the study with GCP.  The Principa l Investigator should notify the Sponsor 
and ethica CRO  no later than 24 hours upon notification of being audited by the FDA  or IRB.  
13.3 Protocol Deviations  
A protocol deviation is any noncompliance with the clinical study protocol, GCP, or Manual of 
Procedures requirements. The noncompliance may be either on the part of the subject, the Principal 
Investigator,  or the study site staff. As a result of deviation s, corrective actions are to be developed 
by the site and implemented promptly.  
It is the responsibility of the site to use continuous vigilance to identify and promptly report 
deviations to ethica CRO . 
All deviations from the protocol must be addressed in  study subject source documents. A 
completed copy of the ethica CRO  Protocol Deviation Form  must be maintained in the regulatory 
file, as well as in the subject’s source document. Protocol deviations must be sent to the IRB per 
its guidelines.  
The protocol  must be rigorously adhered to; however, exceptions will be made in emergency 
situations when the protection, safety, and well -being of the subject requires immediate 
intervention based on the judgment of an Investigator.

14.1 Source Data  
The site is required to maintain adequate and accurate medical records designed to record all 
observations and other data pertinent to the study for each study subject . Source documentation is 
generally considered to be the document on which the information or data point was first recorded. 
Source documentation may include a subject ’s medical records, hospital charts, clinic charts, and 
the site’s  study files as well as the results of diagnostic tests such as X -rays, laboratory tests, an d 
electrocardiograms . 
Source Document Worksheets will be prepared by ethica CRO Inc. for this purpose and serve as 
part of the source record for a subject's study -related data. The Source Document Worksheets  will 
allow for the collection of the following information and allow for  verification of subject identity 
throughout the study : 
a. Subject’s name ; 
b. Subject’s contact information ; 
c. The date that the subject entered the study and the subject number assigned ; 
d. The study title and/or the protocol number of the study and the Sponsor’s name ; 
e. A statement of the ICF process and the date that informed consent , HIPAA , and California 
Experimental Research Subject’s Bill of Rights (if applicable) were signed ; 
f. Records of previous and current dermatological treatments and /or therapies ; 
g. Dates of all subject visits ; 
h. PR-SRS, FACE -Q, GAI, satisfaction  assessments , and pain at time of injection  (and at 15, 
30, 45 and 60 minutes after injection) ; 
i. 30-day patient CTR diaries ; 
j. Anesthetic effect duration diaries;  
k. Study device injection volumes and injection techniques ; 
l. All prescription and non -prescription concurrent medications, therapies, and treatments (up 
to 30 days prior to enrollment through the final study visit) and any changes to the list of 
medications ;

of each subject included in the study. This list should contain the subject’s full name, date of birth, 
dates of participation and identification number as per local  regulations.  
The Principal Investigator must agree to supply all details to Sponsor auditor(s) and/or regulatory 
authorities, ensuring the data is held confidentially at the site after completion of the study. A note 
will be made in the hospital or clinical medical records, if appropriate, that the subject is  
participating in a clinical study.  
The eCRF and subject s’ medical records will be reviewed by ethica CRO , representatives from 
TEOXANE  SA, the IRB , and/or the  FDA to the extent permitted by regulations.  
14.2 Case Report Form  
In this study the case report form will be an eCRF. The study coordinator must complete the eCRF 
for each subject within a timely manner of the visit occurring.  
The site monitor will review the completed eCRF  for accuracy, completeness and consistency with 
source documentation  (i.e., medical records, source document worksheets, etc.) . The site monitor 
will submit requests for correction/clarification of data (e.g., queries) to the study coordinator 
when incons istencies are identified during monitoring and source data verification or during the 
edit check process.   
All corrections and alterations of eCRF data must be made by the study coordinator in a timely 
manner and according to the instructions provided. Com pleted eCRFs  for each visit  (i.e., those 
reviewed by ethica CRO  and with no remaining queries) should then be reviewed and 
electronically signed by the  TI. In order to review and electronically sign the eCRF, the TI will 
each have his/her own login that  will allow them to view only the data that they have generated.  
A full audit trail detailing corrections and alterations made to the eCRF will be maintained.  
Upon study completion, a hardcopy of the eCRF for each subject will be provided to the site. 
14.3 Archiving of Study Documentation  
Essential documents are any records that demonstrate the compliance of the subject, Investigator s, 
Sponsor, and site monitor with the study protocol, with standards of GCP, and with all applicable 
regulatory requirements. Essential documents (including but not limited to study -related 
correspondence (including emails), subject records, subject privacy documentation, records of the 
distribution and use of  study devices , and copies of eCRFs should be retained and available for 
audit by the Sponsor’s auditor and regulatory authorities until at least 2 years after the latest among 
the following scenarios:  completion or termination of the study, the last approval of a marketing 
application, no pending or contemplated marketing applications, or formal discontinuation of 
clinical development of RHA® 1-M with MEPIVACAINE or RHA® 1 with lidocaine . These 
documents should be retained for a longer period, however, if mandated by the applicable 
regulatory requirements, by conditions imposed by the IRB, or by an agreement with the Sponsor. 
It is the responsibility of the Sponsor to inform the Principal  Investigator when these documents 
no longer need to be retained.  
The Sponsor must be notified in writing if the Principal Investigator chooses to store the records 
at a different physical address than the site address or if the Principal Investigator wis hes to 
relinquish ownership of the data so that mutually agreed -upon arrangements can be made for 
transfer of ownership to a suitably qualified, responsible person.

9.7 Statistical methods planned in the protocol and determination of 
sample size
This document contains details of the statistical methods which will be used in the phase IIIb 
clinical trial CLCZ 696B2317. The purpose of this study  is to collect safety  and tolerabilit y 
data on L CZ696 in former PARADIGM -HF patients receiving open -label investigational drug .  
For each country , the study  has a minimum duration of 12 months.  
9.7.1 Statistical and analy tical plans
The planned analysis is described in section 9 of the study  protocol. All data analyses will be 
performed using SAS®statistical software (Version 9.3) unless otherwise noted. To ensure 
consistency  across studies within the project, the RAP refers to the CSU harmonization MAP 
for heart failure (version number Final 1.0) and can be found in Novartis Clinical Research 
Docume ntation and Information sy stem (CREDI) 
9.7.1.1 Analysis sets
The following anal ysis populations will be defined for statistical anal ysis:
Enrolled set (ENR) –All patients who signed the open -label stud y informed consent. 
Safety set (SAF) –All patients who enro lled in the study  and received at least one 
dose of open- label study  medication.
All cases of prospectively  defined protocol deviations will be identified prior to clinical 
database lock and entered into a dedicated data panel as part of the locked databas e. 
All exceptional cases and problems and the final decisions on the allocation of patients to 
populations will be fully  defined and documented before database lock and will be fully 
identified and summarized in the clinical study  report according to ICH E9.
Criteria defining protocol deviations are referenced in the Data Review Plan (DRP).

9.7.1.2 Subject disposition, background and demographic characteristics
9.7.1.2.1 Subject dispositio n 
Patients who signed the CLCZ 696B2317 study  informed consent but do not meet all of the 
enrollment requirements at Visit 1 are considered screening failures.
The number and percent of patients in the enrolled set who discontinue the study  will be 
summari zed. Discontinuations will be further summarized by reasons.
The reason for screen failure will be tabulated and listed. For patients who have re-screening 
visits, the reason for screen failure in the last screening visit will be reported . 
The patients’ center and patient numbers in this study  and their corresponding center and 
patient numbers in PARADIGM- HF study  (i.e., LCZ696B2314) will be listed.
9.7.1.2.2 Patient demographics and other baseline characteristics 
Demographics and baseline data at baseline (defin ed below) will be summarized in the safet y 
set(SAF) . Continuous variables will be summarized by using n, mean, median, standard 
deviation, minimum, maximum, and categorical variables will be summarized by using 
frequency  and percentage. 
Summary  statistic s will be provided for demographics and other baseline characteristics 
including:
(continuous) Age (y ears) 
(categorical) Age group: <65 years, >=65 y ears, <75 y ears, >=75 y ears at Visit 1
(categorical) Sex
(categorical) Race
(categorical) Ethnicity
(conti nuous) Height (cm)
(continuous) Body weight (kg)
(continuous) BMI (kg/m**2)
(continuous)    Sy stolic blood pressure (SBP) mm/Hg
(continuous)    Diastolic blood pressure (DBP) mm/Hg
(continuous)    Pulse (beats/min)
Body mass index (BM I) will be calculated from the measurements of height (m) and body  
weight (kg) measured at Visit 1: BMI = weight / height2.
Relevant medical history  will be summarized by primary  system organ class and preferred 
term using frequency  tables for the safet y set.
Demographic, background, and medical histories data will be listed for the safet y set.
The above anal yses will also be performed for the ENR.

9.7.1.3 Definitions of baseline, post -baseline, and unscheduled visit 
Baseline 
In general, based on the principle described in the protocol, the baseline measurement is 
defined as the available measurement at Study  start/Visit 1. 
Post- baseline 
Any measurements taken after baseline will be considered as post- baseline measurements.
Unscheduled visit 
Unscheduled visit measurements will be taken into account for the analysis of safety 
laboratory  evaluation
9.7.1.4 Missing date handling
All patients with imputed date will be listed for date imputation validation.
9.7.1.4.1 Event date missing or partially missing
If the date of an event is not known or is incomplete, the imputation rules are:
a)If the day of the event is unknown, then the 15thday of this month will be imputed for a 
missing day ;
b)If only  the month is unknown, then July  will be used for imputation of the missing;
c)If only the year of the event is known, then the 1st  of July will be imputed for a missing 
day and month;
d)The above rules are only for general case. If there is additional information available for 
the missing date, then the information should be used and the imputation of missing date
should be treated differently . For example, if an event occurs between two visits and its 
date is missing, then the date in the middle of these visits may  be used.
9.7.1.4.2 Study drug stop date missing
If study  drug stop date is unknown or is incomplete, the imput ation rules are:
a)If only the day field of the drug stop is missing, then the missing date is imputed by using 
the 15th of the month;
b)If year and month are missing, then use thedate of completion/discontinuation of the 
open -label treatment epoch if it is non-missing and no earlier than the start date of 
treatment ;
c)If the drug stop date is completely  missing, then:
a.If patient had fatal AE (identified  as either start or end date is equal to the date of 
death and the AE is flagged as an SAE), handling rules are (in the specified order):
i.AE end date is not missing: use the AE end date to replace the missing 
drug stop date;
Novartis Confidential Page 6
RAP Module 3 2-Mar-2018 (3:26) LCZ696B 2317
ii.AE end date is completely  missing but AE onset date not missing: use the 
AE onset date to replace the missing drug stop date;
iii.AE end date ispartiall y missing (only day field is missing): use Novartis 
standard procedure to impute the AE end date, and then use the imputed 
AE end date to replace the missing drug stop date;
iv.AE end date is completely  missing and AE onset date is partial missing 
(missing the date field only): impute the AE onset date using Novartis 
standard procedure, and then use the imputed AE onset date to replace the 
missing drug stop date;
v.If both the AE onset and end dates are completel y missing then use the last 
previous non-missing visit date plus 35 days to replace the missing drug 
stop date.
b.If patients had no fatal AE, handling rules are the same with the case that year and 
month are missing.
9.7.1.5 Study medication
9.7.1.5.1 Duration of treatment exposure
Duration of the treatment exposure (in days)will be summarized by using n, mean, standard 
deviation, minimum, Q1, median, Q3, maximum for the safet y set. 
The duration of the treatment exposure for a patient, regardless of temporary  interruptions of 
usage of the stud y drug, is def ined as 
date of last study  drug intake –first study  drug date + 1.
The durations on each dose level, time from Visit 1 to the first dose of each dose level, and 
time from the first dose intake to the final top dose will also be summarized. 
Duration of t otal exposure to study  drug (excluding interruptions) will be computed as 
•date of last study  drug intake –first study  drug date + 1 –number of days of treatment 
interruption.
The duration of total exposure to study  drug will be summarized by using n, mean, standard 
deviation, minimum, Q1, median, Q3, maximum for the safet y set.

9.7.1.5.2 Doses and Dose levels
Table 9-2 Dose and dose level
  Dose level  Level  dose
0 0     0 mg
1 1   50 mg
2 2 100 mg
3 3 200 mg
Average dose and dose level will be summarized by  visit and overall study (n, mean, standard 
deviation, minimum, Q1, median, Q3, maximum). 
Average dose at a given visit will be calculated as the sum of reported doses (including zero 
doses for interruption) / Total number of patients.
The formula for the average dose level will be calculated as the sum of reported dose levels 
(including dose level 0 for interruption) / Total number of patients.
The overall average (daily) dose will be calculate d as:
1.Daily  dose for each patient will be calculated as 
∑(  .                             )×(           ) 
   
∑(  .                             ) 
   , 
The definitions of dose level iand level idose are described in Table 9-1. If a patient takes 
two different dose levels in one day (e.g., drug titrations or discontinuations due to safety 
concern), then 0.5 day  willbe count edforthe patient onboth two dose level sin the day.
2.Average dail y dose for each patient over patients.
For the average overall dose level, the formula is similar to that for overall average (daily ) 
dose by using “dose level i”.toreplace “level idose”
Frequency  and percentage of patients at each dose level will be summarized by  visit.
The last recorded treatment on the drug administration form will be presented with the 
number and percentage of patients on each dose level, including dose level 0 . 
The average dose related to the last recorded treatment will also be summarized, for both 
cases of including all patients in the SAF and excluding dose level 0 patients. 
9.7.1.5.3 Treatment exposure in subgroups
The above treatment exposure anal yses will be repeated for the following subgroups:
•Age group <65, ≥65 y ears
•Age group <75, ≥75 y ears
Novartis Confidential Page 8
RAP Module 3 2-Mar-2018 (3:26) LCZ696B 2317
•Gender ( male, female)
•Race (Caucasian, Black, Asian, Other)
9.7.1.5.4 Concomitant heart failure medications
Concomitant heart failure medications are defined as any HF medications administered after 
the enrollment date into the study . Concomitant HF medications will be summ arized by ATC 
and preferred term using frequency  tables for the safet y set.
9.7.1.6 Analysis of the primary  variable
The primary  objective of this study  is to evaluate the safet y and tolerability  of LCZ696 and to 
provide heart failure patients from PARADIGM -HF with open -label access to this 
investigational drug. The safet y evaluation will include:
•Adverse events
•Vital signs
9.7.1.6.1 Adverse events
Any adverse events (AEs) occurred during the study  period will be assessed, overall, by 
primary  system organ class, by preferred term, by maximum severity , by relationship to the 
investigational drug according to the Medical Dictionary  for Regulatory  Activities (MedDRA) .
The MedDRA version used for reporting the stud y will be described in a footnote.
Within each AE report, the following rules are applicable. If a subject reported more than one 
adverse events with the same preferred term, the adverse event with the greatest severity  will 
be presented. If a subject reported more than one adverse event within the same primary 
system organ class, the subject will be counted only once with the greatest severity  at the 
system organ class level, where applicable. 
The number and percentage of subjects reporting the following AEs will be summarized by 
primary  system organ class, preferred term. 
Overall AEs 
Serious adverse events (SAEs) 
AE of special interests (AESIs), i.e. AEs of hypotension, hyperkalemia or renal 
dysfunction
Angioedema/angioedema -like events
Deaths
AEs leading to study  drug dose adjustment/temporary  interruption or permanent 
discontinuation
AEs leading to study  drug permanent discontinuation including deaths
AESI sleading to study  drug permanent discontinuation with patients starting rescue 
medication(s) (ACEI/ARB)

RAP Module 3 2-Mar-2018 (3:26) LCZ696B 2317
The most common adverse events reported ( 1% for each preferred term in the SOC -PT table) 
will be presented in descending frequency  according to its incidence starting from the most 
common event. 
For the legal requirements of ClinicalTrials.g ov and EudraCT, two required tables on 
treatment emergent adverse events which are not serious adverse events with an incidence 
greater than 5% and on treatment emergent serious adverse events and SAE suspected to be 
related to study  treatment will be provided by system organ class and preferred term on the 
safet y set population.
If for a same patient, several consecutive AEs (irrespective of study  treatment causalit y, 
seriousness and severit y) occurred with the same SOC and PT:
a single occurrence will be counted if there is ≤ 1 day  gap between the end date of the 
preceding AE and the start date of the consecutive AE
more than one occurrence will be counted if there is > 1 day gap between the end date 
of the preceding AE and the start date of the consecuti ve AE
For occurrence, the presence of at least one SAE / SAE suspected to be related to study 
treatment / non SAE has to be checked in a block e.g., among AE's in a ≤ 1 day gap block, if 
at least one SAE is occurring, then one occurrence is calculated for that SAE.
The number of deaths resulting from SAEs suspected to be related to study  treatment and 
SAEs irrespective
9.7.1.6.2 Vital Sign 
Sitting systolic blood pressure, sitting diastolic blood pressure, and sitting pulse rate will be 
summarized by  visit with stand ard summary  statistics (n, mean, standard deviation, minimum, 
Q1, median, Q3, maximum), including changes from baseline. Baselines are defined in 
Section 9.7.1.3. Graphical mean plots for these vital signs will also be provided.
The descriptive summaries w ill be presented by  vital sign and visit. Change from baseline will 
only be summarized for subjects with both baseline and post-baseline values and will be 
calculated as:
•change from baseline = post -baseline value –baseline value
9.7.1.7 Analysis of the secondary variable
No secondary  variable defined in this study .
9.7.1.8 Supportive analy ses
For supportive purposes, the analysis of the primary  variable described in Section 9.7.1.6 will 
be applied in the following subgroups:
•Age group <65, ≥65 y ears
•Age group <75, ≥75 years
•Gender (male, female)
•Race (Caucasian, Black, Asian, Other)

9.7.2 Interim analy ses
No interim anal ysis was planned.
9.7.3 Sample size calculation
All surviving patients randomized in PARADIGM- HF can be considered for eligibility  in this 
open -label study  (CLCZ696 B2317). It is estimated that 5,000 patients (about 59% of the core 
study  population and approximately  72% of surviving patients) will meet the eligibility 
criteria and be enrolled into this open -label trial; however, since there is only one treatment 
arm in the study  and treatment -related statistical comparisons are not planned, a specific 
sample size for the study  is not required.
9.8 Changes in the conduct of the study  or planned analy ses
The following changes from the planned analyses according to the study  protocol were 
performed.

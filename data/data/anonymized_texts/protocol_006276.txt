randomization numbers 
1xxx;  subjects in Cohort 
2 will have the 
randomization numbers 
2xxx.  In a case where a 
subject needs to be 
replaced, the last 2 digits 
of the randomization 
number for replacement 
participants will be 
identical to those of the 
original participant’s 
randomization number.  
The second digit, 
however, will be replaced 
with a 2.  For example, if  Randomized 
subjects will be 
assigned with a 6 -
digit randomization 
number in the 
order in w hich they 
are enrolled.  The 
first digit of the 
randomization 
number will refer 
to the part A or B 
(1 or 2). The 
second and third 
digits will refer to 
the Cohort number.  
For example, 
subjects in Cohort 
1 of part A will 
have the 
randomization 
numbers 101xx x; 
subjects in Cohort 
2 of part A will 
have the 
randomization 
numbers 102xxx.  Changed 4 -digit 
randomization 
number to 6 -digit 
in order to 
accommodate part 
A and part B.  
 
 
 
 
Add one more 
digit to 
accommodate 
more cohorts.

 1. PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS  
Title  A Phase 1, Randomized, Double -Blinded, Single -Dose Escalation Study 
Followed by a Multiple -Dose Escalation Study of SKL 24741  in Healthy 
Subjects  
  
Clinical Phase  Phase 1  
  
Objectives  Part A  (single dose  administration ) 
Primary :  
• To evaluate the safety and tolerability of single oral ascending 
doses of SKL 24741  capsule (s) administered to healthy male 
subjects  
Secondary :  
• To evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of  SKL24741  (R-
enantiomer), SKL24742 (S -enantiomer)  (if appropriate) , and its 
possible  metabolites (if deemed necessary ) following 
administration of single oral ascending doses of SKL 24741  
capsule (s) administered to healthy male subjects  
• To assess the food effect  on the PK of SKL 24741  and SKL24742  
(if appropriate)  following administration of a single oral dose of 
SKL 24741  capsule (s) administered to healthy male su bjects  
• To assess the gender effect on the PK of SKL24741  and SKL24742  
(if appropriate)  following administration of a single oral dose of 
SKL24741 capsule(s) administered to healthy female subjects  
 
Part B  (multiple dose  administration ) 
Primary :  
• To evaluate safety and tolerability of multiple oral ascending doses 
of SKL 24741  capsule (s) administered for 14 days to healthy male 
subjects  
Secondary :  
• To evaluate the PK of SKL 24741 , SKL24742  (if appropriate) , and 
its possible  metabolites (if deemed necessary ) following 
administration of multiple oral ascending doses of SKL 24741  
capsule (s) administered to healthy male  subjects  
  
Endpoints  Primary:   
• Safety and tolerability will be based on assessment of adverse 
events, clinically significant laboratory assessments, 
electrocardiograms (ECGs), peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR),  vital 
signs  (blood pressure, heart rate , body temperature, respiratory rate ,

a Subjects will be admitted to the clinic the day prior to study drug administration.  
b Subjects will be discharged on Study Day 4 after the 72 -hour PK sample has been collected and the final assessment has been completed.  
c At screening, a separate informed consent form (ICF) will be used to obtain the subject's consent for the utilization of thei r DNA for pharmacogenomic (PGX) 
testing.  
d For dr ugs of abuse/alcohol screen, refer to Section  10.6.2 .  At the time of signing the ICF, a negative result from the breath alcohol test is required.  
e Complete physical examination should be performed at screening only. Abbreviated physical examination should be performed at all other marked study days. 
See Section  10.6.3 . 
f Height and weight will be collected, and BMI calculated at screening.  Only weight will be colle cted at FU.  
g Highlighted time points for vital signs (Section  10.6.3 ) as follows: pre -dose (baseline), 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 12 hours post -dose on Day 1.  Vital signs should be 
assessed at all other marked study days.    
h Peak expiratory flow rate will be assessed at admission (Day -1), pre -dose (baseline), 2 and 24 hours post -dose after the single dose, and FU.  
i Extensive triplicate ECGs, except for the food effect cohort, will be obtained to collect continuous 12 -lead ECG  data from pre -dose until 24 hours post -dose as 
specified.  Three replicates (triplicate) of ECG data will be collected as close as possible from -0.75, -0.5, and -0.25 hours pre -dose and 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 
and 24 hours post -dose after single dose administration.  Subjects should not eat a meal within 1 hour of digital ECG data collection.  See the instruction on 
lunch and dinner time (Section  8.3.1 ) to avoid any meal intake within 1 hour of the 6 -hour and 12 -hour post -dose ECG time points.  
j For clinical laboratory assessments,  refer to Section  10.6.2 . 
k Postmenopausal status for females of non -childbearing potentia l will be further confirmed with the follicle -stimulating hormone (FSH) serum levels that are 
consistent with postmenopausal status.  Refer to Inclusion Criteria for details (Section  8.1). 
l  Pregnancy test  (serum) will be collected at screening and admission  (Day -1) to confirm pregnancy status of  the gender effect cohort (Section  8.1). 
m  PK blood draw will be performed at pre -dose and 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 16, 18, 24, 36, 48, 60, and 72 hours post -dose following the single dose

Assessment and 
Reporting  Ongoing from the time of signing the Informed Consent Form  
(Non -treatment and Treatment emergent adverse events)  
a Subjects will be admitted to the clinic the day prior to study drug administration.  
b Subjects will be discharged on Study Day 17, after the 72 -hour PK sample from the final dose has been collected and the final assessment has been completed.  
c At screening, a separate informed consent form (ICF) will be used to obtain the subject's consent for the utilization of thei r DNA for pharmacogenomic (PGX) 
testing.  
d For drugs of abuse/alcohol screen, refer to Section  10.6.2 .  At the time of signing the ICF, a negative result from the breath alcohol test is required.

 e Complete physical examination should be performed at screening only. Abbreviated physical examination should be performed at all other marked study days.  
See Section  10.6.3 . 
f Height and weight will be collected, and BMI calculated at screening.  Only weight will be collected at FU.  
g Highlighted time points for vital signs (Section  10.6.3 ) as follows: pre -dose (baseline), 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 12 hours post -dose on Day 1; pre -dose, and at 2, 6, 
and 8 hours post -dose on Days 2 through 14.  Vital signs should be assessed at all other marked study days.  
h Peak expiratory flow rate will be assessed at admission (Day -1), pre -dose (baseline), 2 and 24 hours post -dose after the first dose (Day 1 dosing) and the last 
dose (Day 14 dosing), and FU.  
i Extensive triplicate ECGs will be obtained to collect continuous 12 -lead ECG data from pre -dose until 24 hours post -dose as specified.  Three replicates 
(triplicate) of ECG data will be collected as close as possible from -0.75, -0.5, and -0.25 hours pre -dose, and 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8 hours post -dose on Day 1, 
at pre -dose only on Days 2 through 13, and -0.75, -0.5, and -0.25 hours pre -dose and 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24 hours post -dose on Day 14.  Subjects should 
not eat a meal within 1 hour of digital ECG data collection.  See the instruction on lunch and dinner time (Section  8.3.1 ) to avoid any meal intake within 1 hour 
of the 6-hour and 12 -hour post -dose ECG time points.  
j Clinical laboratory specimens ( Section  10.6.2 ) will be obtained at pre -dose, if study drug administration occurs on the marked study days.  
k On Days 1 and 7, PK blood draw will be performed at pre -dose and 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 16, and 24 hours post -dose.  The 24 -hour post -dose PK 
plasma samples for Days 1 and 7 should be taken before dosing on Days 2 and 8, respectively.  On Days 3 to 6 and 9 to 13, PK blood draw will be performed at 
pre-dose only.  On Day 14, PK bloo d draw will be performed at pre -dose and 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 16, 18, 24, 36, 48, 60, and 72 hours post -dose 
following the final dosing (Section  10.3.1 ).  See Table  8 for PK time window.  
l PGX samples (whole blood) will only be collected from the subjects who consented for DNA testing.

 4. INTRODUCTION  
4.1. Background  
Epilepsy is a neurological disorder that is characterized by an enduring predisposition to 
generate epileptic seizures and the associated cognitive, psychological and social 
consequences (Fisher et al., 2014 ).  An epileptic seizure has a transient behavioral change 
that might be objective signs or subjective symptoms (such as loss of awareness, stiffening, 
jerking, a sensation that rises from the abdomen to the chest, a smell of burnt rubber or déjà 
vu), caused by abnormal excessive or synchronous neuronal activity in the brain (Devinsky et 
al., 2018 ).  Epilepsy is one of the most common neurologic conditions.  Almost 10% of 
people will experience a seizure during their lifetime  (Hauser and Beghi, 2008 ).  Epilepsy is 
the third leading contribut or to the global burden of disease for neurological disorders and 
affects 65 million people worldwide ( Ngugi et al., 2010 ).  About one -third of patients have 
refractory epilepsy ( i.e., seizures not controlled by two or more antiepileptic medications or 
other therapies).  Approximately 75% of epilepsy begins during childhood, reflecting the 
heightened susceptibility of the developing brain to seizures ( Stafstrom and Carmant, 2015 ).  
Although the cause of epilepsy in many patients is unknown, seizures can be the result of 
almost any insult that distu rbs brain function.  These insults include acquired causes (for 
example, after stroke or traumatic  brain injury), infectious diseases (such as 
neurocysticercosis), autoimmune diseases , and genetic mutations.  To date, over 500 genes 
associated with epilepsy have been identified (Devinsky et al.,  2018 ). 
Epilepsy is classified in terms of epilepsy syndromes and seizure types.  The latter is 
determined by the electroencephalography  (EEG ) patterns observed when the seizure is 
occurring and by the clinical seizure characteristics.  Examples of seizure  types include 
absence seizures (previously known as petit mal), simple partial seizures (previously known 
as focal motor or aura), complex partial seizures (previously known as psychomotor or 
temporal lobe ) and  generalized tonic -clonic  seizures (also known as grand mal) (Meinardi et 
al., 1985 ).  
Once seizure types are identified, this information determines the epilepsy syndrome in 
conjunction with information about cause, age of  onset, and interictal EEG abnormalities.  
Epilepsy can be basically classified as idiopathic (no apparent structural injury, probable 
genetic cause) or symptomatic (structural brain abnormality of known or unknown cause).  
Further differentiation can be m ade on whether the seizures begin in a focal region (partial 
epilepsy) or begin diffusely (generalized epilepsy).  Idiopathic generalized epilepsy is the 
most common childhood epilepsy; absence, myoclonic, and generalized tonic -clonic seizures 
may also be seen.  In adults, symptomatic partial epilepsy is most common and may cause 
simple partial, complex partial, or generalized tonic -clonic seizures (Commission on 
Classification and Terminology of the International League Against Epilepsy, 1981).  
Although t he International League Against Epilepsy updated new classification of epilepsy in 
2017, the previous classification method was used to avoid confusion in this summary.   
SKL24741 [(1 R)-2-(5-methyl -1,3,4 -oxadiazol -2-yl)-1-[3-[4-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]phenyl] 
ethanol] is a novel small molecule that is being developed by SK Life Science, Inc. for the

SKL24741                                                                  Protocol SKL24741C001 - Amendment 3.0

 treatment of epilepsy . SKL24741 is intended for oral administration and is a potent inhibitor 
of voltage -gated sodium channels  (Nav) .  SKL24741 is a chiral compound with an R -
configuration; SKL24741 displays more potent efficacy in a refractory partial -onset seizure 
(rPOS) animal model and a broader safety margin in animal studies compared to  the 
(S)-enantiomer (SKL24742).  
The first -line treatment for epilepsy i ncludes antiepileptic drugs (AEDs)  of which over 20 
drugs have been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration  (US FDA) 
and the European Medicines Agency (EMA).  However, despite the availability of many 
AEDs, approximately one -third of patients fail to achieve seizure control (Devinsky et al., 
2018 ).  Therefore, the key unmet needs are: effective drugs for drug-resistant epilepsy, 
improved tolerability of drug treatment, development of individualized treatments based on 
epilepsy syndrome, and disease -modifying therapies.  Based on the results for SKL24741 in 
in vitro  studies and animal models of rPOS  and oth er types of epilepsy, this compound has 
the potential to address these unmet needs.  
Further details regarding the SKL24741 studies are discussed in the Investigator’s Brochure . 
4.1.1.  Nonclinical Experience  
In vitro  and in vivo  nonclinical studies were conducted to investigate primary and safety 
pharmacology properties; absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) 
properties, pharmacokinetic drug interactions; and toxicology of SKL24741 according to the 
current regulatory guidance.  All definitive in vitro  safety pharmacology and pivotal 
toxicology studies were conducted in compliance with Good Laboratory Practice ( GLP ) 
regulations.   As with many neurological compounds, SKL24741 has a steep dose response 
with respect to adverse central nervous system  (CNS ) clinical signs in rats and dogs 
(Section  4.1.1.3 ). 
4.1.1.1.  Pharmacology  
A range of in vitro  mechanism of action and in vivo  efficacy studies have  been conducted to 
characterize the primary pharmacodynamics of SKL24741.   In vitro  mechanism of action 
studies were conducted with SKL24741, including radioligand binding assays, functional 
assays , and ion channel patch clamp assays to evaluate the select ivity of SKL24741 and the 
potential for off -target effects.  An extensive series of in vitro  studies were conducted to 
evaluate the effects on synaptic ion channels , including sodium, calcium, and potassium ion 
channels, as well as its effects on gamma -aminobutyric acid  (GABA ), N-methyl -D-aspartate 
(NMDA ), and hyperpolarization -activated cAMP -regulated cation 1 (HCN1 ) currents.  
Functional assays evaluating the effects of SKL24741 on serotonin  5-hydroxytryptamine 
(5-HT) receptor subtypes  showed that SKL24741 significantly (i.e., ≥50%)  inhibited 5 -HT 2A, 
5-HT 2B, 5-HT 2C, and 5 -HT 1D with half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values of 5.6, 
2.8, 66, and 81  μM, respectively.  In in vitro  electrophysiology assays with sodium channels, 
SKL 24741 exhibited state -dependent inhibition of the voltage -gated sodium channel  (Nav)  
1.6 current amplitude with an IC 50 value of 0.47  μM in the inactivated phase.  SKL24741 
also inhibited other subtypes of human voltage -gated sodium channel s (hNav) in a state -
dependent manner, including hNav1.1 (IC 50=1.7 μM), hNav1.2 (IC 50=0.7 μM), hNav1.3 
SK Life Sc ience, Inc.             IND No. 141225  
SKL24741                                                                  Protocol SKL24741C001 - Amendment 3.0  
46 
 (IC 50=1.1 μM), hNav1.7 (IC 50=0.59  μM), and Nav1.8 (IC 50=0.89  μM).  SKL24741 has a 
much higher affinity for the inactivated state rather than the resting state of Nav channels.  A 
higher affinity of SKL24741 for the inactivated state compare d to the tonic state of Nav 
channels would contribute towards a pr eferential selectivity target ing the pathological 
conditions of epilepsy with potentially less adverse side effects (Eijkelkamp et al., 2012 ).  In 
a kinetic study using human Nav1.6 channels, SKL247 41 (1  μM) significantly slowed the 
recovery time from fast inactivation of Nav1.6 channels.  These profiles of SKL24741 on 
voltage -gated sodium channels may contribute to its antiepileptic activity against bursting 
neurons under epileptic conditions .  In a preliminary study, SKL24741 displayed an 
enhancement effect of Big Potassium ( BK) channels in stably expressed human embryonic 
kidney ( HEK ) cell line.  
In vivo  pharmacology studies have demonstrated the efficacy of SKL24741 in various rodent 
models of refractory partial -onset seizures  (rPOS ), generalized tonic -clonic seizures (GTCS), 
and generalized myoclonic seizures (GMS).  SKL24741 demonstrated efficacy in th ree 
mouse and one rat model s of rPOS.  SKL24741 produced a dose -dependent protective effect 
on electroshock -induced seizure s in mice following intraperitoneal ( IP) and oral 
administration.  Although less potent than SKL24741, (S)-enantiomer chiral compound  
(SKL24742 ) and the racemate compound (SKL24505 ) also protected against seizures 
induced by 6 -Hz electrical stimulation at 44  mA in a dose -dependent manner in mice.  IP 
administration of SKL24741 also produced a dose -dependent protective effect on amygdala -
kindled seizures in male Wistar rats and significantly reduced both seizure score s and 
electroencephalographic ( EEG ) after-discharge durations  (ADD ).  In the pentylenetetrazol 
(PTZ)-induced kindling seizure test in mice, SKL24741 resulted in a significant  reduction in 
seizure score by 42 .9%.  In a pilocarpine -induced spontaneous recurrent seizure (SRS) 
model, the maxim al protection rate for SKL24741 was 50% at the highest dose tested .  In a 
GTCS model using the maximal electroshock seizure (MES) test, SKL24741 produced a 
dose-dependent seizure  protection effect in both mice and rats . 
Finally, the efficacy of SKL24741 was further demonstrated in two GMS models in male 
mice.  These models w ere induced by administration of PTZ, a non -competitive GABA A 
receptor antagonist, or methyl 6,7 -dimethoxy -4-ethyl -β-carboline -3-carboxylate 
hydrochloride  (DMCM), which binds specific benzodiazepine binding sites with high 
affinity ; both are potent convuls ants.  In both models, SKL24741 had dose -dependent 
protective effect s.  Overall, SKL24741 displays a broad spectrum of efficacy in antiepileptic 
animal models.  The results of in vivo  efficacy studies suggest that, at doses devoid of 
behavioral toxicity, S KL24741 possesses a broad anticonvulsant spectrum in rat and mouse 
seizure models predictive of efficacy against generalized seizures, partial seizures and 
especially rPOS.  
When tested against 112 CNS targets in radioligand binding assay s and 34 CNS target s in 
functional assay s, SKL24741 (50  μM) showed no significant ( i.e., ≥50%) binding affinity for 
receptors and enzymes located in the CNS with the exception of human dopamine D4.2 (66% 
inhibition), rat peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR ) (51% inhibiti on), human sigma 2 
(54% inhibition), human dopamine transporter ( hDAT ) (63% inhibition), and human 
norepinephrine transporter ( hNET ) (63% inhibition).  In functional assays, SKL24741

SKL24741                                                                  Protocol SKL24741C001 - Amendment 3.0  
47 
 showed  half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 5.6, 2.8, 65.5 and 81 μM for 4 
serotonin receptor subtypes ( 5-HT 2A, 5-HT 2B, 5-HT 2C, and 5 -HT 1D). 
In an in vitro  human ether -á-go-go related gene  (hERG ) assay in  HEK293 cells, SKL24741 
inhibited hERG potassium channel current s in a concentration -depend ent manner, with an 
IC50 of 21.1  µM.  Overall, this result indicates  low potency for the hERG channel as there 
was a substantial safety margin based on SKL24741 exposures at efficacious doses in rodent 
seizure models  (i.e., Cmax ≈ 2.5 3 μM; plasma protein b inding = 96.2 %).  Further evaluations 
using cardiac ion channels to determine cardiovascular risk showed that SKL24741 inhibited 
(concentration -dependent ) peak hNav1.5 (IC 50=20.2  μM) and late hNav1.5 (IC 50=4.91  μM) 
current s in HEK293 cells stably expressing hSCN5A and hCav1.2 current s (IC 50=17.2  μM) 
in Chinese hamster ovary ( CHO )-K1 cells.  Cardiovascular effects were also evaluated in 
vivo in a GLP  study in telemetered male dogs ; after single oral dose s of SKL24741 , there 
were no unscheduled mortalities and no SKL24741 -related changes in any of the parameters  
evaluated with the exception of decrease d QTc interval s at ≥10 mg/kg from 0.5 to 18 hours  
post-dose (up to -9 msec [-4%]). 
SKL24741 -related neurotoxicity was evaluated in non -GLP studies in mice and rats using the 
rotarod test  after oral or IP administration .  Following single IP administration  of SKL24741 
in mice and rats, the peak toxicity time was 0.5 -hour post-dose with a median neurotoxic 
dose (NTD 50) of 17.3 mg/kg .  Following single oral administration of SKL24741 in rats, the 
peak toxicity time was 1 -hour post-dose with an NTD 50 of 177 .5 mg/kg .  The effects of 
SKL24741 on locomotor activity (LMA) w ere evaluated in male rats.  There were no 
significant effects of SKL24741 on LMA up to a single oral administration of 100 mg/kg.  In 
a GLP study, the modified Irwin battery of assessments was used to evaluate the CNS effects 
of SKL24741 administered up to  40 mg/kg in male rats.  Foll owing oral administration, 
decreased extensor thrust and dilated pupils of both eyes were noted in rats administered 
≥30 mg/kg, and moderate grasping loss, moderate piloerection, and lower body temperature 
(up to -1.0°C) were noted in rats administered with 40 mg/kg.  Based on these findings, the 
no observed  effect  level (NOEL) for neurological function  in this oral study  was 15  mg/kg.  
In a GLP study, the respiratory effects of SKL24741 were evaluated in male rats using head -
out plethysmography.  SKL24741 h ad no significant effect s on tidal volume . However, there 
was a decrease in respiration rate s up to 28 breaths /minute ( -22%) and a decrease in minute 
volume up to 62 mL/minute (-28%).   All doses had similar respiratory effects, and no NOEL 
dose was observe d.  These observations are considered to be related to the pharmacological 
action of SKL24741, and the temporal response was consistent with the extended exposure  
profile of SKL24741 in rats.  
4.1.1.2.  Pharmacoki netics 
The pharmacokinetics (PK) of SKL24741 have been studied both i n vitro  and in vivo.   
Toxicokinetic (TK) evaluations were performed as a part of oral repeat ed-dose toxicity 
studies in rats and dogs for up to 28 days.  SKL24741 is intended for oral administration, 
therefore its absorption PK propertie s were evaluated in an in vitro  permeability assay and 
following single oral and intravenous ( IV) dosing in male mice, rats, and dogs.  Plasma

48 
 samples were analyzed for SKL24741 levels using high performance liquid chromatography 
coupled with tandem mass s pectrometry.   
SKL24741 demonstrated high permeability with efflux ratios of 0.916 to 0.985 in Caco -2 cell 
monolayers .  Assessments with breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) and P -glycoprotein 
(P-gp) inhibitors indicated that SKL24741 may be a substrate  of BCRP  and P -gp.  H owever, 
given the large passive permeability of SKL24741, it is unlikely that the in vivo  absorption of 
SKL24741 would be impacted by efflux due to these transporters.   
In single -dose bioavailability and PK studies in male mice, rats,  and dogs, SKL24741 was 
administered by IV bolus or oral gavage .  The elimination kinetics of SKL24741 following a 
single IV bolus dose varied slightly across species.  The highest clearance (CL) and shortest 
half-life (t ½) were observed in mice, the lowes t CL was observed in dogs and the longest t ½ 
was observed in rats.  Across species tested in the nonclinical program (mice, rats, dogs), CL 
values were 3- to 4-fold lower than the calculated values of liver plasma flow (i.e., 3.0, 1.8, 
and 1.1 L/h r/kg, respectively)  (Davies and Morris, 1993 ), indicating that SKL24741 was 
cleared slowly from the body .  Vol ume of distribution was comparable in mice and dogs and 
both were less than that observed in rats ; Such  data also indicated SKL24741 distributed 
outside of the central compartment.  For fed and fasted rats given SKL24741 orally, the 
exposures were similar between the two feeding states. The relative bioavailability  (Frel) of 
SKL24741 after oral administration in mice, fed and fasted rats, and dogs was high 
(Frel82.9%).  Based on a single -dose radiolabeled PK study, male and female rats had 
similar exposures , indicating no sex differences  following  both IV and oral doses . 
TK parameters were evaluated in non -GLP and GLP oral toxicity studies of up to 28 -day 
duration.  In general, sex differences in SKL24741 exposure, in terms of C max and area under 
the concentration -time curve from time zero to 24 hours post -dose (AUC 24hr), were less than 
2-fold in both rats and dogs , indicating no gender difference s.  In both species, exposure 
tended to increase with increasing dose levels, but dose -proportionality va ried depending on 
species and dose level s.  No accumulation was observed in rats  and dogs  following 28 days 
of oral administratio n. 
SKL24741 was highly bound to plasma proteins across species (mouse: 98%, rat: 9 6%; 
rabbit: 96%; dog: 98%; monkey: 97%; and human: 96% ; all values are approximate means ).  
Blood -to-plasma concentration ratios were approximately 0.8 to 1.0 for all species and 
concentrations , indicating SKL24741 primarily partitioned into the plasma .  In a quantitative 
whole -body autoradiogra phy study with [14C]-SKL24741 in rats , [14C]-SKL24741 was 
widely distributed to most tissues .  Although tissue concentrations of radioactivity were still 
detectable in all tissues at 72  hours post-dose, concentrations  decreased steadily between 120 
through 672  hours post -dose with most tissues at below the limit of quantitation (BLQ) by 
672 hours post -dose.  Tissue -to-blood exposure ratios in the cerebellum were 2.3 to 3.8 -fold 
indicating [14C]-SKL24741 partitioned int o the brain tissue regardless of sex or rat strain 
(same trend noted in other brain regions).  The concentration of radioactivity in pigmented 
tissues, specifically the uveal tract, had greater exposures than those observed for all other 
tissues, suggestin g an apparent  association of [14C]-SKL24741 with tissues containing 
melanin.

 In vitro metabolism studies indicated that SKL24741 had high metabolic stability in rat, 
rabbit, dog, monkey and human microsomes, and moderate metabolic stability in mouse 
micros omes.  In hepatocytes, SKL24741 showed high metabolic stability in rat s and rabbit s 
and moderate stability in m ice, dog s, human s, and monkey s.  In a  separate  hepatocyte assay, 
SKL24741 showed notably greater metabolism in monkey s, compared to other species .  A 
total of six SKL24741 metabolites were found following incubation with mouse, rat, rabbit, 
dog, monkey, and human hepatocytes.  Similar metabolic profiles were observed in 
hepatocytes from rats, rabbits, dogs, and humans, with no unique human m etabolites.  
Metabolite M1 was not observed in monkey hepatocytes but was seen in human hepatocytes 
and all other species.  SKL24741 showed low potential for covalent binding to liver proteins 
and low potential to form reactive metabolites that could bind to liver proteins .  At a 
concentration up to 100  μM, SKL 24741 had no inhibitory effect  on cytochrome P450 (CYP)  
2B6, CYP2 C8, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4 ( i.e., IC50 >100  μM for isozymes).  The IC 50 values 
CYP1A2, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19 were 21.1  μM, 99  μM, and 58.7  μM, respectively.  
Excretion of SKL24741 was evaluated following single oral administration of 
[14C]-SKL24741 in rats.  The primary route of elimination of radioactivity was in the feces , 
with high levels being recovered in the bile of cannulated rats, sugge sting that hepatic 
clearance and biliary excretion play an important role in the elimination of [14C]-SKL24741.  
4.1.1.3.  Nonclinical safety  
Nonclinical toxicology studies have been conducted in Sprague -Dawley rats and Beagle dogs 
to support oral administration of SKL24741  in humans.  In vitro  metabolite profiling data 
supported the selection of rats and dogs as the rodent and non -rodent toxicology species.  All 
pivotal studies were performed i n compliance with  GLP regulations (21 Code of Federal 
Regulations (CFR ) 58).  All doses were given once daily via oral administration to support 
clinical dosing.  
In a non -GLP study in male and female rats, single administration of ≥120  mg/kg SKL24741 
resul ted in severe clinical signs of hypoactivity and ataxia with low body carriage and/or 
lateral recumbency  and led to the unscheduled euthanasia of the 120 and 200  mg/kg animals.  
Administration of 40 or 80  mg/kg SKL24741  resulted in animals that were ataxic  or had low 
body carriage , but fully recovered by Day 2.  Administration of 80 mg/kg also led to 
decreased body weight gain and food consumption .  As clinical signs and body weight 
effects for 80 mg/kg were generally tolerable, the maximum tolerated dose ( MTD) following 
single oral administration in rats was 80  mg/kg.   
In a non -GLP 7 -day repeat -dose toxicity and TK study, male and female  rats were 
administered dose s of 0, 20, 40, or 80  mg/kg/day  SKL24741 .  Due to severe clinical signs of 
hypoactivity and a taxia  with low body carriage and/or sternal or lateral recumbence , all 
animals (main and TK animals) dosed at 80  mg/kg/day were euthanized on Day 1  within 3 
hours post -dose.  Treatment -related clinical signs of hypoactivity, ataxia, hunched posture, 
piloerection, thin appearance, or limited use of hind limbs were noted for most animals 
administered 40  mg/kg/day beginning on Day 5.  Treatment -related w eight loss and 
decreased food consumption were also observed at this dose level following the first few 
doses of SKL24741.  SKL24741 -related reduced reticulocytes and increased cholesterol were

 observed in all animals administered 40  mg/kg/day.  Based on t hese findings, the 7 -day MTD 
in rats was 40 mg/kg/day (Day  7 C max and AUC 24hr values of 7.40  µg/mL and 111  µg*h/mL, 
respectively, in males and 12.5  µg/mL and 269  µg*h/mL, respectively, in females).  
In a GLP 28 -day repeat -dose study toxicity and TK study, male and female  rats were 
administered 0, 15, 30, or 40 mg/kg/day  SKL24741.  No unscheduled mortalities were 
observed.  Clinical observations were dose -responsive and included transient ataxia and 
hypoactivity for both sexes administered  ≥30 mg/kg/day and l ow body carriage for animals 
administered 40  mg/kg/day.  Isolated incidences of hunched appearance and lateral 
recumbency were also observed at 40  mg/kg/day.  Clinical signs were considered adverse at 
40 mg/kg/day due to the nature and severity of the obse rvations.  Dose -dependent decrease in 
body weight, correlating with decreased food consumption, was observed at ≥30  mg/kg/day; 
however, these observations were not considered adverse due to their transient nature and 
reversibility.  Clinical chemistry chan ges included mild, reversible, higher cholesterol 
concentration in males and females administered ≥15  mg/kg/day and ≥30  mg/kg/day, 
respectively, which w ere not considered adverse.  SKL24741 -related increased liver weights 
were observed in males administere d ≥30  mg/kg/day and females administered ≥15 
mg/kg/day.  Microscopic liver findings of minimal centrilobular hepatocyte hypertrophy 
were observed in males and females administered ≥30  mg/kg/day.  These findings were 
consistent with potential microsomal enz yme induction in the liver, an adaptive response, and 
were considered non -adverse due to their minimal severity and partial recovery following the 
2-week recovery phase. Based on FDA recommendation, a NOAEL of 15  mg/kg/day was 
considered for calculating th e starting dose (mean combined sex C max values was 3.32 µg/mL 
and AUC 24hr 61.2 µg*h/mL ). 
In a non -GLP toxicity study, male and female dogs were administered a single dose of 20, 
60, 100, or 300 mg/kg SKL24741.  At doses ≥100  mg/kg, clinical signs of lateral (only 
300 mg/kg female) and sternal recumbency, ataxia, hypoactivity, emesis, and/or fo amy white 
vomitus, and excessive salivation were observed.  Decreased food consumption was noted in 
animals administered ≥60  mg/kg with full recovery before the next dosing occasion.   The 
MTD following single oral administration in dogs was 100  mg/kg.  
In a non-GLP 7 -day repeat -dose toxicity and TK study, male and female  dogs were 
administered 50/10, or 100/30  mg/kg/day  SKL24741.  Animals were initially administered 
50 or 100  mg/kg/day.  For the 100  mg/kg/day animals, the moribund condition of one male 
and o ne female on Day 3 resulted in the unscheduled euthanasia of these two animals.  
Together with clinical observations of body tremors, rigidity, decreased responsiveness, 
motor impairment, hypoactivity, ataxia, emesis and vomitus, and excessive salivation i n the 
other animals dosed at 50 and 100  mg/kg/day, all surviving 50 and 100  mg/kg/day animals 
had a 9 -day non -dosing period followed by dose level reduction to 10  and 30  mg/kg/day, 
respectively.  Clinical signs at these reduced dose levels were limited to a single incidence of 
emesis and vomitus in one female administered 30  mg/kg/day.  SKL24741 -related excessive 
salivation was noted after dosing at ≥10 mg/kg/day.  SKL24741 -related changes in absolute 
and/or relative organ weights were noted in animals admi nistered ≥50/10  mg/kg/day, 
including the adrenals, epididymis, heart, kidney, liver, ovaries, pituitary, prostate, spleen, 
testes, thymus, thyroid, and uterus/cervix.  Based on these findings, the 7 -day MTD for

51 
 SKL24741 in dogs was 30  mg/kg/day (Day 7 mean  combined sex C max and AUC 24hr values of 
3.20 µg/mL and 32.2  µg*h/mL, respectively).  
In a GLP 28 -day repeat -dose toxicity and TK study, male and female dogs were administered 
0, 10, 20, or 40 mg/kg/day  SKL24741.  Clinical observations included ataxia and/o r 
hypoactivity, emesis and/or vomitus, and excessive salivation in animals administered ≥10 
mg/kg/day; intermittent tremors in animals administered ≥20  mg/kg/day; decreased 
reactivity, retching, and clear oral discharge in animals administered 40  mg/kg/day ; and 
sternal recumbency on a single day in one animal administered 10 mg/kg/day.  Severity and 
frequency of clinical findings increased in a dose -proportional manner; however, the clinical 
observations were not severe enough to be considered adverse and s howed evidence of 
reversibility during the 2 -week recovery phase.  Based on FDA recommendation, a NOAEL 
of 10 mg/kg/day was considered for calculating the starting dose (mean combined sex C max 
values was 2.61 µg/mL and AUC 24hr 21.7 µg*h/mL).  
SKL24741 did not show any genotoxic potential in a GLP bacterial reverse mutation (Ames) 
assay or in a  GLP  in vitro  human lymphocyte micronucleus assay.  After oral administration 
up to 40  mg/kg SKL24741  to male Sprague -Dawley rats, there was no increase i n 
micronucleated polychromatic  erythrocytes.  Additionally, SKL24741  absorption data 
indicated that SKL24741 was not sufficiently photoreactive to result in direct phototoxicity  
in humans.   
4.1.2.  Clinical Experience  
SKL 24741  has not been studied  in humans.  
4.2. Ratio nale for Present Study  
The rationale for developing SKL 24741  is based on the nonclinical evidence indicating that 
SKL 24741  is a potent  inhibitor of  voltage -gated sodium channel s and a possible  activator of 
Big Potassium (BK) channels .  SKL24741 was shown to  have  a broad anticonvulsant 
spectrum in rat and mouse seizure models predictive of efficacy against epilepsy, including 
generalized seizures, partial seizures and especially rPOS  (Section  4.1.1.1 ). 
To date, nonclinical safety and pharmacokinetic findings indicate that SKL 24741  has a  
favorable  safety profile ( Section  4.1.1.3 ) and dose -dependent drug exposure  
(Section  4.1.1.2 ). 
This single and mu ltiple ascending dose study is  designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, 
and PK of SKL 24741  administered orally to healthy adult subjects.    
4.2.1.  Study Design Rationale  
A schematic of the proposed  study design is presented  below in Figure  1.  
The study includes a  sequential  cohort design that is intended to optimize subject safety and 
assess  tolerability, safety, and PK of SKL 24741 .  In the single -dose escalation part of the 
study (Part A), tolerability, safety, and PK of SKL 24741  will be assessed in healthy male 
subjects under fasting  condition.  At an appropriate dose based on PK results, one dose 
SK Life Sc ience, Inc.             IND No. 141225  
SKL24741                                                                  Protocol SKL24741C001 - Amendment 3.0  
52 
 cohort  will be repeated with the subjects  under fed condition , in order to evaluate the 
magnitude of the food effect on the disposition of SKL 24741 .  To assess the gender effect on 
the disposition of SKL24741 , female subjects will be treated at one dose  level  under fasting  
condition . 
Figure  1: Schematic of study design  
 
The multiple dose portion of the study (Part  B) will evaluate the tolerability , safety, and PK 
of SKL 24741  after 14 days of dosing in healthy male subjects.  Dose s, dosing regimen, and 
food status  (fasting  vs. fed)  used in Part B will be determined based on the outcome of 
Part A.  The selection of  the first dose level of SKL24741 in  Part B will be determined based 
on safety and PK information  from Part A.  
During Part A  and Part B , a sentinel dosing strategy  will be used (Section  7.2).  Safety 
reviews will be performed prior to  dose escalation from  one cohort to another (dose level 
increase) .  Dose escalation criteria and dose stopping rules (Section  7.3) will be applicable at 
any time.  
4.2.2.  Dosing Rationale  
As this study is the first -in-human  (FIH) study, the initial dose of SKL 24741  has been 
conservatively selected according to the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 
guidance document entitled “ Estimating the Maximum Safe Starting Dose in Initial Clinical 
Trials for Therapeutics in Adult Healthy Volunteers ” (FDA Guidance for Industry, 2005 ). 
The dose levels planned for the Phase 1 clinical trial are based on the overall safety and 
tolerability profile of SKL24741 established in the nonclinical program .  In the GLP 28 -day 
oral toxicity studies, the FDA -recommend ed no observed adverse effect level ( NOAEL ) 
doses of 15  mg/kg/day for rats and 10  mg/kg/day for dogs were used for the human starting 
dose calculations .  Based on the results of the  SKL24741 toxicol ogy studies, rats were 

SK Life Sc ience, Inc.             IND No. 141225  
SKL24741                                                                  Protocol SKL24741C001 - Amendment 3.0  
53 
 considered the most sensitive species . On a body surface area ( BSA ) basis , human equivalent 
dose (HED ) in rats is 15 mg/kg/day ÷ 6.2 =  2.42 mg/kg/day; HED based on the NOAEL in 
dogs is 10 mg/kg/day ÷ 1.8 = 5.56 mg/kg/day .  By applying  a 10-fold safety factor to the 
HED of 2.42 mg/kg/day for rat  NOAEL, the maximum recommended starting dose ( MRSD ) 
for a Phase 1 clinical study in healthy volunteer is 0.242  mg/kg (or 14.5 mg based on an 
assumed human weight of 60 kg [calculation = 2.42 mg/kg/day ÷ 10 (safety factor) × 60 kg]).  
Table  3 provides an overview of the NOAELs from the  28-day GLP  repeated -dose 
toxicology studies  and the  systemic exposure s at the NOAEL dos e levels .  The  HED, MRSD, 
and calculated  human starting dose  are also presented.

*NOAELs based on FDA recommendation   
Based on the se data  from the most sensitive species (rat) , the MRSD is approximately 14.5 
mg with a  10-fold safety factor applied  to the HED (HED ÷ 10).  However, a larger safety 
factor of approximately 15 was applied to the HED (HED ÷ 15) due to steep dose -toxicity 
profile in rats and dogs  (Section  4.1.1 ).  Therefore, the  starting dose of th is FIH clinic al study 
will be a single oral dose of 10 mg of SKL24741 .  With t his starting dose , a safety factor 
would be approximately 33 from the HED derived from the dog. 
The first cohort of th e single ascending dose ( SAD ) study will receive a single dose at the 
Dose 1 level (i.e., 10 mg) and subsequent cohorts will receive doses up to 1000 mg (as a 
single dose) based on the prediction from allometric scaling and in silico assessment.  
However, dose levels of SKL24741 will be adjusted if needed based on plasma exposure, 
safety and tolerability observed at each dose level during the study . 
The single -dose escalation scheme (Part A) is designed to explore a range of doses up to the 
plasma exposure observed at the NOAEL  of 10 mg/kg/day  in dogs (Day 28 mean combined 
sex C max and AUC values of 2.61 µg/mL and 21.7 µg*hr/mL, respectively ; Table  3) if the 
safety and tolerability allow reachin g this plasma exposure.  A few additional single dose 
levels beyond the dog NOAEL exposures may be considered if the safety and tolerability 
warrant a higher dose of SKL2474 1.  However, the dose escalation increment will not exceed 
1.5-fold between each do se level due to the steep dose  response observed in toxicology 
species  (Section  4.1.1 ).  The institutional review board ( IRB) will be notified prior to 
initiating these additional cohorts.  In any case, the plasma exposure in humans will not

 exceed the exposure observed at the NOAEL  of 15 mg/kg/day  in rats ( Day 28 mean 
combined sex Cmax and AUC values of 3.32 µg/mL and 61.2 µg*h r/mL, respectively).  
After the first dos e level, if drug exposure in humans differ from what is expected from  
nonclinical studies, the dose -escalation scheme  may be re -evaluated .  The dose level selected 
to assess the preliminary food and gender effect s may also be re -evaluated .  Any changes to 
the dose escalation scheme will be reviewed and  approved by the Sponsor  and submitted to 
the IRB.

 7. STUDY DESIGN  
7.1. Overview of Study Design  
This is a two-part, double -blind ed, randomized study  of SKL 24741 .  The schematic of study 
design is shown in Figure  1.  Table  4 further outlines the study design.  
Part A  is a single -dose escalation  study in healthy male subjects , except for the gender effect 
cohort  in he althy female subjects .  It is expected that a total of 66 subjects ( 60 male  and 6 
female subjects ) will be enrolled in Part A .  Each subject will be given a single oral dose of 
study drug capsule (SKL 24741  or placebo) on one occasion .  There will be 6 new subjects at 
each dose level (4  subjects randomized to SKL 24741  and 2 to placebo)  during single -dose 
escalation .  Study drug will be administered under  fasting  condition , except for one cohort 
utilized for the food effect assessment  at one of the dose levels .   
To evaluate the magnitude of the food effect on the disposition of SKL24741, a cohort of 
subjects will receive a second dose of study drug under  fed condition (Period 2)  at an 
appropriate dose level based on PK results .  After completing Period 1 (fasting ) as part of 
single dose escalation , these subjects will return to the clinical research unit ( CRU ) for a 
second confinement to receive a second single dose (same dose level ) of study drug under 
fed condition .  A washout period of at least 1 4 days is planned between fasting  and fe d 
cohorts (i.e., between Period 1 and Period 2) .  As subjects complete the Follow -up visit of 
Period 1 and then return to the CRU for re -admission ( Day -1 of Period 2 ), the same  study 
procedures will apply again  (including Day -1 procedures)  in order to initiate Period 2 . 
To assess the gender effect on the disposition of SKL24741, a set of 6 female subjects of 
non-childbearing potential will be treated at one dose level under fasting cond ition. 
At each dose level , except for the food and gender effect cohorts, a sentinel dosing strategy 
will be used  as described in Section 7.2. 
Part B  is a multiple -dose escalation study in 32 healthy male subjects .  Doses , dosing 
regimen , and food status ( fasting  vs. fed)  used in Part  B will be determined based on the 
outcome of Part A .  Dosing will extend over a 14-day period  at each dose level .  Four dose 
levels will be assessed, and s ubjects will be rand omized into one of the four dose levels .  
Each dosing co hort will have 8 new subje cts (6 subjects rando mized to SKL24741 and 2 to 
placebo ) dosed each day for 14 days (Table  4).  Daily dose level in Part B will not exceed the 
maximum dose level used in Part A.    
At each dose level, a sentinel dosing strategy  will be used as described in Section 7.2.

• Each cohort  of 8 subjects will receive the study drug each day for 14 days.  Subjects will remain 
in the clinic for a 17 -night stay  (discharged on Study Day 17) . 
• Doses, dosing regimen, and food status (fasting  vs. fed) used in Part B will be determined based 
on the outcome of Part A . 
• A sentinel dosing strategy  (Section  7.2) will be used for all cohorts  in Part B.  
A cohort of female subjects will be added to Part A for the preliminary gender effect 
assessment  as shown in Table  4.  These female subjects will need to be of non -childbearing 
potential, have undergone a sterilization procedure  at least 6 months prior to dosing  with 
official documentation (e.g., hysteroscopic sterilization, bilateral tubal ligation or bilateral 
salpingectomy, hysterectomy, or bilateral oophorectomy ), or be postmenopausal with 
amenorrhea for at least 1 year prior  to dosing and follicle -stimulating hormone (FSH) serum 
levels consistent with postmenopausal status as per Principal Investigator ’s judgment.  
7.2. Dosing strategy  
A sentinel dosing strategy  will be used in both Part A (SAD) and Part B  (MAD) , except for 
the foo d and gender effect cohorts .  The investigator and the Sponsor  will assess safety and 
tolerability data and determine whether it is acceptable to continue dosing (within cohorts) or 
to dose escalate  (between cohorts).   
Table  5 summarizes the sentinel dosing strategy  as the following .  The first 2 subjects (1 on 
SKL24741 and 1 on placebo) within each cohort  may be dosed at the same time .  
Randomization will ensure that one of these 2 subjects (sentinel subjects) receives placebo.  
If the doses are safe and tolerated, as determined by the investigator and the Sponsor , dosing 
of the remaining subjects will occur after the observation period  as specified in Table  5.

 Table  5: Sentinel Dosing Strategy  
Dose level   
(Part A and Part B)  Observation Period  and Safety Review  
First dose level  1) Two sentinel subjects (1 on SKL24741 and 1 on placebo)  
2) 14-day observation period after dosing the first subject with 
SKL24741  
3) The investigator and  the Sponsor review all available blinded safety 
data at the end of observation period . 
4) The remaining subjects dosed  within the cohort  
Second dose level and 
higher  1) Two sentinel subjects (1 on SKL24741 and 1 on placebo)  
2) 7-day observation period after dosing the first subject with SKL24741  
3) The investigator and the Sponsor review all available blinded safety 
data at the end of observation period.  
4) The remaining subjects dosed  within the cohort  
Dose escalation between the cohorts (dose increase ) will only proceed  if the safety and 
tolerability of the previous dose(s) are acceptable as judged by the investigator and the 
Sponsor .  If available/needed, PK analysis results will also be considered .  The investigator 
and the Sponsor may adjust  the observation period based on the disposition of SKL24741 .   
The initiation and the final choice of the dose level for the food and gender effect cohorts 
(single dose administration) will not be performed until the PK and safety/tolerability are 
considered to be acceptable for the dose level provided under fasting condition and in healthy 
male subjects, respectively (Part A, single dose administration)  (Figure  1 and Section  7.1). 
The investigator  and the Sponsor  will take all precautions necessary for studies at an earl y 
stage in the development of a new chemical entity.  Dose escalation criteria and dose 
stopping rules (Section  7.3) will be applicable at any time.   
7.3. Dose Escalation Criteria  
The investigator and the Sponsor will review all available blinded safety (and applicable PK) 
data in a blinding fashion at the end of each dose group before deciding to escalate to the 
next dose level.  Dose escalation decision will be jointly made by the  investigator and the 
Sponsor.  The dose level may be adjusted from the protocol planned dose, if deemed 
necessary.   
The investigator will stop dose escalation or recommend modification of the dose escalation 
if in his/her judgment, and in consultation wi th the Sponsor, such action is medically prudent 
to protect safety of the subjects.  
Study drug administration and dose escalation will be discontinued if, within a cohort, 2 or 
more subjects (for Part A) or 3 or more subjects (for Part B) experience a labo ratory

 abnormality or significant clinical event (severe or life -threatening), considered by the 
investigator to be related or possibly related to the study drug.  
The initiation and the final choice of the first dose level of Part B (multiple dose 
administ ration) will not be performed until the PK, safety, and tolerability at such 
corresponding dose level after single dose administration (Part A) are assessed and 
considered to be acceptable.   
Dose escalation  in Part A and Part B will be stopped based on th e dos e stopping rules .  The 
situations where the dose stopping  rules apply are  outlined in Table  6.  If one of the 
following situations occur s, dose will not be escalated.    
Table  6: Dose Stopping Rules  (Part A and Part B)  
Situation 1  PK futility where the magnitude of plasma exposure (AUC) of SKL24741 
increase is disproportionate and not considered meaningful regarding the 
dose increase.  
Situation 2  Safety/tolerability profile does not warrant a higher dose to be investigated.  
Situation 3  The plasma exposure of SKL2474 exceeds the dose range justified in the 
dosing rationale (Section  4.2.2 ).

 9.4.2.  Allocation of Randomiz ation Numbers  
Subjects fulfilling the eligibility criteria will be  randomized  to receive their treatment 
according to the randomization list . 
Randomized subjects will be assigned with a 6-digit randomization number in the orde r in 
which they are enrolled.  The first digit of the randomization number will refer to the part A 
or B (1 or 2). The second and third digits will refer to the Cohort number.  For example, 
subjects in Cohort 1  of part A  will have the randomization numbers  101xxx; subjects in 
Cohort 2 of part A will have the randomization numbers 102xxx.  In a case where a subject 
need s to be replaced, the last 2 digits of the randomization number for replacement 
participants will be identical to those of the original parti cipant’s randomization number.  
The fourth digit, however, will be replaced with a 2.  For example, if the original 
participant’s randomization number is 110101, then the randomization number for the 
replacement participant will be 110201. Participants who prematurely discontinue from the 
study may be replaced  at the sponsor’s discretion.  
9.5. Packaging and Labeling  
For each dos e level  in the study, SKL 24741  study drug and placebo will need to be prepared

 9.10.1.  Blinding  
For each part (Part A and Part B) of the study, eligible subjects will be assigned to their 
randomization number linked to the dosing group by an unblinded pharmacist at the clinic al 
site.  During the conduct of the study, all study personnel will be blinded to subject treatment 
assignments except for the following individuals: the bioanalytical laboratory ( SK Life 
Science, Inc.  Toxicology group or designated contract research organ ization [CRO]),  the 
statistician preparing the randomization list (C RO), the dispensing pharmacist and the 
pharmacy QC/qualit y assurance (QA) personnel, as applicable .  If a subject is unblinded for 
safety -related regulatory reporting reasons  (Section 9.10.2 ), SK Life Science, Inc.  will 
become aware of the subject's treatment assignment.  
To maintain the blind ing, the study drug will be administered in an appropriate manner 
(amber container , for instance) .  The dispensing of the study drug will be carried out by the 
unblinded clinical site personnel in a way that maintains blinding of the study .  The 
unblinded cli nical site personnel will not , otherwise , participate in the study and are not 
permitted to reveal any information to the study team, other study personnel  and subjects.   
A copy of the randomization assignment list will be made available to the pharmacist to 
allow the dispensing of the investigational product to take place.  This documentation will be 
kept in a secure location until the clinical database has been locked.   One set of sealed 
envelopes containing the randomization list will be available to t he Principal Investigator at 
the start of the study.  
9.10.2.  Unblinding  
At the initiation of the study, the study site will be instructed on the method for breaking the 
blind .  The method will be either a manual or electronic process.  
Unblinding of individual subjec t’s treatment by the investigator should be limited to medical 
emergencies or urgent clinical situations in which knowledge of the subject's study treatment 
is nece ssary for clinical management .  In such cases, the investigator must first attempt to 
contac t the study Medical Monitor  (see relevant telephone contact number provided in 
Section  12.1.3  or separate contact information document),  to discuss the  need for unblinding .  
In situations in which the investigator has tried, but is unable to reach  the study Medical 
Monitor, he/she  shou ld use his/her  best judgment, based on the nature and urgency of the 
clinical situation, and may proceed with unblinding without having successfully reached and 
discussed the situation with the study Medical Monitor .  In this case, the investigator will 
notify the Sponsor  immediately after or as soon as possible.  
Once a subject's treatment assignment has been unblinded, the medical monitor and study 
coordinator should be notified within 24  hours of unblinding of the treatment .  Information 
relating to unbli nding (e.g., reason, date) shall be clearly recorded in the subject’s study file, 
as part of relevant standard operating procedures (SOPs) .  In addition, the investigator should 
consider whether the clinical event prompting unblinding should be considered a serious 
adverse event  (SAE), according to the regulatory definitions or criteria for SAEs, and if so, 
submit an SAE report to SK Life Science, Inc.  within 24 hours ( Section  12.1).

SKL24741                                                                  Protocol SKL24741C001 - Amendment 3.0  
71 
 SK Life Science, Inc.  retains the right to break the blinding for subjects who experience 
SAEs suspected to be causally related to an investigational product and that potentially 
require expedited reporting to regulatory authorities .  In addition, SK Life Science, Inc.  may, 
for matters relating to safety concerns, unblind individual subjects at any time.  
After dosing each cohort , the safety and preliminary PK data will be provided to the Sponsor  
in a blinding fa shion.   If needed, preliminary  dataset of  drug concentration may be disclosed 
in an unblinding fashion to the Sponsor under restricted conditions  (e.g., data quality  
control ).   
9.11. Prior and Concomitant Medications  
A table of p rior and conco mitant medication restrictions is  provided in Appendix  B. 
9.11.1.  Prohibited and Prior Medications  
Subjects should stop taking  any prescription, nonprescription, and herbal medications as well 
as any dietary supplements and specific fruit products at least 14  days before the first dose of 
the study drug, per exclusion criteri on 6 in Section  8.2.  Potential subjects should only stop 
taking any prescribed medication s at the direction of a physician and consult a physician 
before stopping any regular treatment with nonprescription medications . 
If any medication has been taken between the screening and  the dose of  study drug in Part A, 
and between the screening and the first dose of study drug in Part B, regardless of when 
dosing of the medication ended , the name, dose, route, regimen , start/stop dates, and reason 
for its use will be documented in the subject's electronic case report form  (eCRF).  
9.11.2.  Concomitant Medications  
Subjects will not take any prescription, nonprescription, or herbal medications, dietary 
supplements, or fruit products listed in exclusion criteri a (Section  8.2) during the study until 
completion of the Follow -up visit assessments . 
Acetaminophen is an acceptable concomitant medication .  A maximum of 1000 mg within 
24 hours may be prescribed by the investigator or designee  when necessary .  Other 
medication to treat adverse events may be prescribed only after consultation with the SK Life 
Science, Inc.  Medical Monitor unless the medication is necessary to eliminate an apparent 
immediate hazard to a subj ect.  The investigator will notify the SK Life Science, Inc .  
Medical Monitor within 24 hours of prescribing medications to treat adverse events, if 
indicated.  
All concomitant medications (including drug name, dose, route, regimen, start/stop dates,  and 
reason for its use) administered for the time period from administration of the dose of the 
study drug in Part  A or the  first dose of study drug  in Part B  through to the Follow -up visit 
will be documented in the subject’s eCRF.

10.3.3.  Sample  Collection, Processing and Handling for PK Assessment  
Detailed procedures for the sample collection , processing and handling for PK assessment  
will be provided in a separate document  (i.e., Sample Handling Guidelines ).  The following 
Sections (Section  10.3.3.1  and Section  10.3.3.2 ) briefly summarize the sample processing 
and handling for blood and urine.  
The shipment address and assay lab contact information will be provided to the 
investigational site prior to initiation of the trial.   
Blood and urine samples may be used for metabolite and biomarker expl oratory analyses .  
Possible results from these exploratory analyses may be reported in standalone report(s) if 
deemed necessary.  
10.3.3.1.  Blood Sample Processing   
Blood (whole  blood ) will be collected via direct venipuncture or by an indwelling catheter at 
each sch eduled sample time point .  Blood samples will be collected into blood collection  
tubes containing K 2EDTA anticoagulant .  The content of the tube will be mixed gently by 
inverting 6 to 8 times (without shaking), and the sample will be placed in an upright p osition 
on wet ice until ready for centrifugation .  Blood samples should be processed to harvest 
plasma within 30  minutes of collection .  Blood samples will be centrifuged at 4 oC for 
10 minutes at approximately 2000 xg to separate plasma .  Plasma will be aliquoted into 
labeled cryogenic storage vials , followed by storage at -70 oC in an upright position  until 
shipment to the bioanalytical laboratory .  Refer to the Sample Handling Guidelines  for 
detailed sample collection, processing and handling.  
10.3.3.2.  Urine Sample Processing  
Urine collection for PK analysis at a given time interval should be collected into a urine 
container maintained in ice or refrigerated for the duration of collection .  At the end of each 
collection time interval, the total volume o f urine collected over the given time interval

SKL24741                                                                  Protocol SKL24741C001 - Amendment 3.0  
74 
 should be recorded  as part of PK data .  Refer to  the Sample Handling Guidelines  for detailed 
sample collection, processing and handling.    
10.3.4.  Bioanalysis  
Concentration of SKL 24741  (R-enantiomer) and SKL2474 2 (S-enantiomer ) in plasma and 
urine will be determined using validated liquid chromatography -mass spectrometry/mass 
spectrometry (LC -MS/MS) method s.  
Residual and/or backup p lasma and/or urine sample s may be assessed for additional 
SKL 24741  metabol ites and/or other exploratory assessments, if deemed necessary .  If 
performed , data from these assessments will be documented separately in standalone 
report(s).  
10.4. Pharmacogenomics  
Pharmacogenomic (PGX) investigations explore the role of genetic variation in  determining 
an individual’s response to drugs .  A separate i nformed consent for genotyping will be 
obtained from each subject prior to sampling.   These PGX investigation s allow evaluation of 
genes coding for proteins that are involved in the absorption, d istribution, metabolism and 
excretion (ADME) of drugs .  The gene sequences to be determined include known and likely 
functional variations of key ADME genes and incorporate more than 90% of ADME -related 
genetic markers identified by the PharmaADME group (weblink.pharmaadme.org) .  The 
pharmacogenomic data  may be included in the final  study  report , if deemed necessary.   
10.4.1.  Blood collection for PGX samples  
Blood (whole blood) will be collected  into blood collection tubes containing K 2EDTA 
antic oagulant  at the pre -dose stage (prior to any drug administration) from each subject  who 
consented for genotyping .  The content of the tube will be mixed gently by inverting 6 to 8 
times (without shaking), and the sample will be stored  in its original s ampl e tube in an 
upright position until shipment to the pharmacogenomic laboratory  or biorepository .  Whole 
blood will be stored at -70oC for the subsequent DNA extraction and genotyping .  Refer to 
Sample Handling Guidelines for detailed sample collection, processing and handling . 
10.5. Efficacy  
Not applicable.  
10.6. Safety  
Safety evaluations will include clinical laboratory assessments, vital signs, physical 
examinations, ECGs, peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR),  Columbia -Suicide Severity Rating 
Scale (C -SSRS ) (Part B only), and reporting of adverse events .  The SK Life Science, Inc.  
Medical Monitor will review these parameters on an ongoing basis during the study, in order 
to evaluate the safety of study drug dosing . 
Physical examination information collected  at screening will be captured for inclusion into 
the clinical database .  Any untoward findings identified during physical examinations will be

SKL24741                                                                  Protocol SKL24741C001 - Amendment 3.0  
75 
 captured as adverse events, if those findings meet the definition of an adverse event .  
Demographic data collect ed at screening will be included in the clinical database.  
10.6.1.  Adverse Events  
Adverse events (serious and non -serious) will be assessed, documented, and reported in 
accordance with International Conference on Harmoni zation Good Clinical Practice 
(ICH -GCP) .  Section 12.1 briefly outlines the definitions, collection periods, criteria, and 
procedures for documenting, grading, and reporting of all adverse events .  A separate 
document will be provided for the detailed eCRF completion guidelines for adverse events 
for investigators, and training will be provided.  
10.6.2.  Clinical Laboratory Assessments  
Clinical lab oratory assessments to be conducted in this study are sho wn in Table  10.  Blood 
and urine s pecimens  will be analyzed at the CRU  or its designated laboratory as appropriate .  
Clinical laboratory specimens  are to be collected under  fasting  condition  (subjects should not 
take food or fluids, except  of water, for at least 6  hours prior to s pecimen collection).  
The investigator or designee will perform an assessment of all clinical laboratory data for 
clinical significance .  Clinical laboratory paramet ers will be determined for all subjects using 
the CRU’s or designated laboratory’s routine clinical laboratory methods .  Laboratory test 
results that are abnormal and considered clinically significant must be reported as adverse 
events (Section 12.1.4 ). 
Monitoring of Laboratory Abnormalities  
In the event of unexplained or unexpected clinically significant laboratory test values, the 
investigator may choose to repeat the test(s) as soon as possible and follow until the results 
have returned to the normal range and/or an adequate explanation for the abnormality is 
found .  The investigator will clearly mark all laboratory test values that are outside the 
normal ra nge on the lab oratory  repor ts and will indicate which of these deviations are 
clinically significant .  Any abnormal laboratory result judged by the investigator to be 
clinically significant will be classified as an adverse event and will be recorded on the  
adverse event eCRF .  The investigator will also determine the severity and causality.

10.6.3.  Physical Examinations  and Vital Signs  
A full physical examination (review of all body systems) , an abbreviated (symptom -directed) 
physical examination, and vital sign evaluation  will be performed at select study visits, as 
specified in Table  1 and Table  2. 
A full physical examination includes a review of the follo wing systems: head/neck/thyroid, 
eyes/ears/nose/throat,  respiratory,  cardiovascular, lymph nodes, abdomen,  skin, 
musculoskeletal, and neurological .  Breast, anorectal, and genital examinations will be 
performed  when medically indicated .  For the conduct of the eye examination, the site’s 
standard procedures should be followed.  
Physical examinations are to be performed by the Principal Investigator  or designee  
(physician, physician a ssistant, or nurse practitioner) listed on the Form FDA 1572.  
Vital sign evaluations include blood pressure (systolic and diastolic  measurements in supine  
and standing in the same sequence in each subject , in order to allow orthostatic 
measurements ), temp erature, heart rate, respiratory rate , and arterial oxygen saturation 
(SaO 2) (using pulse oximetry) .  Additional vital sign assessments may be performed if 
clinically indicated, in the opinion of the investigator .  Clinically significant abnormal 
findings in vital signs and physical examination will be reported as adverse events.  
10.6.4.  Electrocardiograms  
For study conduct, electrocardiograms ( ECGs ) will be classified as either safety or triplicate  
ECG s at the time points indicated in Table  1 and Table  2.  Electrocardiograms will be 
recorded using the site’s standard ECG equipment .  All ECGs will be obtained using 
instruments that analyze data using the same algorithms and produce the same data for 
interpretation .  Digital ECGs will be captured and tr ansferred to the designated core 
cardiology laboratory for ECG analysis .  Collection of additional ECGs for routine safety 
monitoring at additional time points or days is at the discretion of the investigator based on 
GCP.   
ECGs will be obtained using a Mo rtara continuous 12 -lead digital ECG recorder .  The ECG 
will include all 12 -standard leads and will be recorded at a paper speed of 25 mm/sec .  
Standard ECG parameters will be measured, including  heart rate ( HR), RR, PR, QT, QTc 
intervals,  and QRS duration .  All ECGs should be collected after at least 5 minutes of supine 
rest and prior to blood sample collection .  The device will remain connected to the subject 
during the collection periods  as appropriate .  The ECG data will be transmitted wirelessly to 
the Surveyor system, which will extract ECG recordings at the protocol specified time points.  
Triplicate ECGs will be extracted approximately 1 minute apart reviewed and analyzed by 
the central ECG laboratory .  The ECG extractions will be tim e-matched to the PK samples 
but obtained before the actual sampling time to avoid changes in autonomic tone associated

 with the psychological aspects of blood collection as well as the reduction in blood volume 
subsequent to blood collection .  The continuo us ECG data will be sent to the central ECG 
laboratory for a high -resolution measurement of the cardiac intervals and morphological 
assessment .  The ECG core laboratory staff will be blinded to treatment, time, and study day 
identifiers.  
10.6.4.1.  Safety 12 -Lead ECG s 
Standard 12 -lead ECGs should be performed at  the time points indicated in Table  1 and 
Table  2, in addition to  any other time s, if clinically indicated .  The following guidelines must 
be followed:   
• The subject will be instructed to rest in the supine position for at least 5 minutes 
before having an ECG performed,  
• The ECG will be performed prior to any other procedures that may affect heart 
rate (e.g., blood draws).  
The ECG data traces will be made for safety review by the investigator and maintained with 
source documentation .  Any clinically signific ant ECG abnormalities at screening will 
exclude the subject’s participation in the study .  Thereafter, c linically significant abnormal 
findings will be reported as adverse events.  
To ensure safety of the subjects, the Principal Investigator or designee will make 
comparisons to Day -1 (baseline) measurements .  If the QTc is increa sed by >60  msec from  
the Day 1 pre-dose value  or an absolute QTc value is >500 msec for any scheduled ECG, 
2 additional ECGs wil l be collected, approximately 2 to 4 minutes apart, t o con firm the 
original measurement .  If either of the QTc values from these repeated ECGs remain  above 
the threshold value (>60  msec  increase from the Day 1 pre-dose; or is >500 msec ), a single 
ECGs must be repeated at least hourly until QTc values from 2 successive ECGs fall below 
the threshold value that triggered the repeat measurement.  
10.6.4.2.  Extensive  Triplicate ECGs  
Extensive triplicate 12-lead EC Gs, except for the food effect  cohort, will be obtained to 
collect continuous 12 -lead ECG data from pre-dose until 24 hours post -dose at the specified 
time points  (Table  1 and Table  2).  Triplicate 10 -second, 12 -lead ECG recordings  (digital 
ECGs)  will be obtained  within a 5 -minute time window around the targeted time points 
outlined in the Schedule of Assessments described in Table  1 for Part A (single  dose 
administration ) and Table  2 for Part B (multiple  dose administration ).  During the extensive 
triplicate 12 -lead ECG assessment, meal intake should be avoided within 1 hour of ECG data 
collection.  
Timing and recording t echnique for ECGs will be standardized for all subjects .  Subjects will 
be required to lie quietly in a supine position with minimal movement and minimal exposure 
to noise and other environmental stimuli for at least 5 minutes before the ECG time point in 
order to allow for quality ECG data.  All ECG data should occur in a 5 -minute time window 
around the targeted time .  If digital ECGs are artifactual and of poor quality, analyzable 10 -

80 
 second ECGs will be repeated as close as possible to targeted  time point s.  Actual time of the 
ECG recording will be used for the analysis . 
The triplicate 10 -second, 12 -lead ECG time points post-dose are guided by PK animal data 
and are based around the estimated  Tmax.  The time points may be changed depending on PK 
informatio n obtained during the study from previous cohorts.  
10.6.5.  Columbia -Suicide Severity Rating Scale   
The Columbia -Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS)  is a brief questionnaire that provides 
for the identification, quantification, and standardized assessment of the occurrences and 
severity of suicidal ideation and behavior .  The C -SSRS will be assessed only after multiple 
dose administration  (Part B).  The “Baseline (Lifetime/Recent)” version of the  C-SSRS  will 
be assessed at screening ( Appendix  C).  The C-SSRS  “Since Last Visit” version will be 
asses sed on other  study  days ( Appendix  D). 
10.6.6.  Peak Expiratory Flow  Rate  (PEFR) Measurement  
Peak expiratory flow rate ( PEFR) will be measured within a 30 -minute time window around 
the targeted time points as outlined  in the Schedule of Assessments in  Table  1 for Part A 
(singl e dose administration ) and Table  2 for Part B (multiple  dose administration ).  The peak 
expiratory flow rate (PEFR, also known as a peak flow) is the ma ximum rate that a person 
can exhale during a short maxim al expiratory effort after a full inspiration .  Measurements 
will be performed in an upright position, with lips tightly closed around the mouth  piece of 
the peak flow meter and blowing out as hard and as fast as possible into the meter.  
10.6.7.  Contraception and Pregnancy  
The effects of SKL 24741  on conception,  pregnancy, and lactation in humans are not known .  
SKL 24741  did not show any genotoxic potential in a standard battery of in vitro  (Ames,  
human lymphocyte micronucleus ) and in vivo  (rat bone marrow micronucleus) studies  (see 
Investigator’s Brochure ). 
10.6.7.1.  Cont raception  
Subjects who can father a child must agree to use 2 highly effective method s of 
contraception , including at least one barrier method , as follows .  Male s ubjects must use a 
condom with spermicide  and if subject’s female partner is of childbearing potential, she must 
use 1 of the following highly effective methods of contraception:  
• Hormonal contraception , 
• Occlusive cap (cervical cap or diaphragm) with spermicide , 
• Intrauterine device.  
For male subject s with female partner(s) of non-childbearing potential (i.e.,  post-menopausal 
or post -surgical sterilization)  at least 6  months before the first dose of study drug , no 
additional contraception method is required .

81 
 For all study subjects who can father a child with partners of child -bearing potential, all 
methods of contraception, including abstinence, must be used from the time of consent 
through 90  days afte r the last dose of study drug .  Subjects who se partners  become of child -
bearing potential during the study must agree to the contra ceptive requirements.  
10.6.7.2.  Pregnancy  
If the female partner of a subject becomes pregnant, the subject must permanently 
discontinue study treatment .  The investigator  must notify the Medical Monitor , SK Life 
Science, Inc ., and IQVIA by completing the Pregnancy R eport form, faxing and emailing the 
form as per the Table of Contact ( Table  13 and Table  14), within 24 hours of the site’s 
knowledge of the partner’s pregnancy .  The subject's treatment assignment will be unblinded, 
and if the subject was taking the active drug, the subject's partner will be followed until the 
end of pregnancy (e.g., delivery, miscarriage) and the infant exposed in-utero  will be 
followed for 1 year after birth, provided consent is obtained .  An ICF will be provided to 
explain these follow -up activities. Pregnancy does not constitute an adverse event.

This section presents a summary of the planned clinical pharmacology and safety analyses 
for this study .  Safety statistical analysis detail s will be provided in the Statistical Analysis 
Plan (SAP) for this study, and clinical pharmacologic analysis details (including the 
definition of the PK population ) will be provided in the Clinical Pharmacology Data Analysis 
Plan (CPAP), both of which will be finalized prior to clinical database lock.   
Final analyses will take place after all subjects have completed the study  and all data have 
been entered in the clinical study database.  
11.1. Sample Size and Power  
No formal sample size calculations hav e been performed .  This study utilizes the sample size, 
or the number of subjects , that is commonly employed  in early clinical pharmacology 
studies , in order to  achieve the study objectives .  Subjects who do not complete all the 
treatments and assessments specified in this protocol may be replaced .   
11.2. Analysis Populations  
• Safety  Population : All subjects who were  randomized and received  at least 1 
dose of study drug .   
• PK Population : All subjects who  receive d at least 1 dose of study drug and have 
sufficient  PK data  without  any major  protocol deviations.    
All subject (randomized or dosed) data will be presented in the subject data listings.  
11.3. Clinical Pharmacology Analysis  
11.3.1.  Pharmacokinetic Analysis  
The PK analys is of SKL24741 (R -enantiomer)  and SKL24742 (S -enantiomer) (if  
appropriate)  will be performed using non -compartmental analysis (NCA) method .   
The following PK parameters will be calculated for SKL24741 and SKL24742 (if 
appropriate)  for the plasma  concentration -time profile : Maximum concentration (Cmax), time 
to maximum concentration (tmax), area under the concentration -time curve (AUC) from 0 to 
infinity  (AUC ∞), AUC from time 0 to a given time t  (AUC t), AUC  over the dosing interval  
(AUCτ ), apparen t clearance (CL/F) , apparent volu me of distribution ( Vd/F), half-life (t½), and 
accumulation ratio (R acc).  In addition, the fraction excreted unchanged in the urine (fe) and 
renal clearance ( CL R) will be calculated, if deemed appropriate .  If SKL24741 metabolites 
are quantified in this study, appropriate PK parameters will be calculated for metabolites .  
Other PK parameters will be determined , as deemed appropriate.   
A detailed description of the planned PK analysis will be presented in the CPA P.  Statistical 
analyses  on PK data may be performed if deemed appropriate.

Statistical analysis details will be provided in the SAP for this study, which will be finalized 
prior to clinical database lock.  
11.4.1.  General Considerations  
The SK Life Science, Inc . Biometrics designated CRO will analyze the safety data derived 
from this study.  Only descriptive analyses will be performed; no statistical hypothesis testing 
will be done .  Continuous variables (e.g., age) and PK parameters will be summarized by 
means of  descriptive  statistics  (e.g., number of subjects ( n), arithmetic mean, arithmetic 
standard deviation ( SD), standard error of the mean (SEM), coefficient of variation ( CV), 
geometric mean, geometric CV, median, first and third quartile s, minimum, and maximum) .  
If the measurements in the source (raw) data are integers, then the corresponding mean  and 
median will be presented to 1 decimal place and the SD to 2 decimal places; if the 
measurements are obtained to 1 decimal place, then the mean and median will be presented 
to 2 decimal places and the SD to 3 decimal pla ces; and so forth .  Minimum and maximum 
will be displayed as reported in the source (raw) data .  Categorical variables (e.g. , presence 
of an adverse event) will be summarized  using counts and  percentages .  Percentages will be 
presented to 1 decimal place unless otherwise specified .  Statistical  analysis results will be 
presented by treatment group and as appropriate.  
All subject data, including derived, will be presented in the subject data l istings; listings will 
display all subjects who were randomized  and/or dosed with the study drug . 
11.4.2.  Background Characteristics  
11.4.2.1.  Subject Disposition  
The number and percentage of subjects in each disposition category (e.g., randomi zed,  
completing treatment per iod, completing  the Follow -up visit, and discontinuing study with a 
breakdown of the reasons for discontinuation) will be summarized by the treatment  group.  
11.4.2.2.  Demographics and Baseline Characteristics  
Demographic, parameters  and baseline characteristics will  be summarized for the Safety 
Population .  Continuous variables will be summarized by descriptive summary statistics and 
categorical variables by  the number and percentage of participants . 
11.4.2.3.  Medical History  
Medical history encompassing abnormalities and surgeries reported before the Screening 
visit will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA), 
version 19.0 or newer.  
SK Life Sc ience, Inc.             IND No. 141225  
SKL24741                                                                  Protocol SKL24741C001 - Amendment 3.0  
84 
 11.4.2.4.  Prior and Concomitant Medications  
Medications  will be coded using the World Health Organization -Drug Dictionary 
(WHO -DD) and summarized by medication class and preferred term for the Safety 
Population as frequency tables in 2  parts : 
• Prior medication:  medication received between the Screening visit and the dose of 
study drug in Part  A, and between the Screening visit and  the first dose of study drug 
in Part B, regardless of when dosing of the medication ended,  
• Concomitant medication: medication  received at or after the  dose of the study drug 
in Part  A or the  first dos e of study drug  in Part B.  
If the medication start date is on or after  the date of initial dosing of the study drug, then 
medication will be summarized as concomitant medication regardless of the medication end 
date.  If the medication end date is before  the date of initial dosing of the study drug, then 
medication will be summarized as prior medication regar dless of the medication start date .  
The prior and concomitant medication s will be summarized separately .  
11.4.2.5.  Study Drug Exposure  
Exposure to study drug in Part B  (multiple dose administration ) will be defined as total 
number of days treated with study drug d uring the study, with total days calculated as last 
day of study drug minus first day of study drug plus 1  day.  
11.4.2.6.  Study Drug Compliance  
As the study drug will be administered under direct supervision  at the study site,  no analysis 
of compliance will be perf ormed.  
11.4.3.  Efficacy Analysis  
As efficacy is not being measured in this study, no efficacy analysis will be performed.  
11.4.4.  Safety Analysis  
The overall safety profile of SKL 24741 , relative to placebo, will be assessed in terms of the 
following safety endpoints:  
• Incidence of treatment -emergent adverse events  
• Clinical  laboratory values (hematology, coagulation, clinical chemistry, urinalysis  
and chole sterol ) 
• ECG outcomes  
• Vital signs  
• Peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR)  
• Columbia -Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS)  (Part B only)

Safety analysis set.  
All safety data will also be presented in individual subject data listings.  
11.4.4.1.  Adverse Events  
Adverse events will be c oded according to Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
(MedDRA) .  The number and percentage of subjects experiencing an adverse event will be 
summarized by the MedDRA system organ class and preferred term, as well as by dose 
received .  Adverse even ts will be classified as pre -treatment or treatment -emergent.  
Pre-treatment adverse events are defined as adverse events that were reported or worsened 
after signing the ICF up to start of study medication.  
Treatment -emergent adverse events  are defined as adverse events that were reported or 
worsened on or after start of study medication through the Follow -up visit.  
Only treatment -emergent adverse events will be summarized in tables .  Treatment -emergent 
adverse events will hereafter be referred to as “adver se events.”  
The incidence of adverse events will be summarized .  Adverse event summaries will include 
the following:  
• All adverse events  (regardless of severity or relationship to study drug)  
• SAEs  
• Adverse events by  severity  
• Adverse events by  relationship t o study drug  
• Adverse events leading to discontinuations  
• Adverse events leading to deaths  
Adverse event summaries will be presented by MedDRA System Organ Class and Preferred 
Term.  A subject with multiple occurrences of the same adverse event or a continuing 
adverse event will be counted once, and only the maximum severity level will be presented in 
the severity summaries, and the worst relationship level in the relationship summaries .  
Adverse events will be listed separately for those leading to d eath, SAEs, dose interruption, 
and permanent discontinuation.  
All adverse events through the Follow -up visit will be listed in an individual subject data 
listing, including pre -treatment adverse events.

 12. PROCEDURAL, ETHICAL,  REGULATORY, AND 
ADMINISTRATIVE CONSI DERATIONS  
12.1. Adverse Event  
12.1.1.  Definition  
An adverse event (AE)  is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject 
participating in a clinical investigation .  This AE  does not necessarily need to have  a causal 
relationship with the treatment .  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended 
sign ( e.g., a clinically significant abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease 
temporally associated with the use of an investigational product, wheth er or not related to the 
investigational product.  
A suspected adverse reaction (SAR)  is any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility 
that the study treatment caused the adverse event .  ‘Reasonable possibility’ means that there 
is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the study treatment and the AE .  A 
suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality than adverse 
reaction, which means any AE caused by a study treatment.  
An AE may be:  
• A new illness,  
• Worsening of a concomitant illness or a baseline event,  
• An effect of the study treatment; it could be an abnormal laboratory value as well 
as a significant shift from baseline within normal range which the Principal 
Investigator or medical ly qualified desi gnate considers to be clinically important.  
Surgical procedures themselves are not AEs .  They are therapeutic measures for conditions 
that required surgery .  The condition for which the surgery is required is an AE, if it occurs 
or is detected during the t reatment period .  Planned surgical measures permitted by the 
clinical study protocol and the condition(s) leading to these measures are not AEs, if the 
condition(s) was (were) known before the start of study treatment .  In the latter case, the 
condition sh ould be reported as medical history.  
A serious adverse event (SAE)  or reaction is any untoward medical occurrence that at any 
dose:  
• Results in death,  
• Is life -threatening,  
• Requires nonscheduled (not routine or planned) subject hospitalization for ≥ 24 
hours  or prolongation of existing hospitalization for ≥ 24 hours,  
• Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity (defined as a substantial 
disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions),  
• Is a congenital anomaly or birth defec t, 
SK Life Sc ience, Inc.             IND No. 141225  
SKL24741                                                                  Protocol SKL24741C001 - Amendment 3.0  
89 
 • Is an important medical event  defined as an event that does not fit one of the other 
outcomes but may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical 
intervention (treatment) to prevent one of the other outcomes .  Examples include 
allergic br onchospasm (a serious problem with breathing) requiring treatment in 
an emergency room, serious blood dyscrasias (blood disorders), or 
seizure/convulsion that does not result in hospitalization .  The development of 
drug dependence or drug abuse would be ot her examples of important medical 
events.  
• All AEs that do not meet any of the criteria for seriousness should be regarded as  
non-serious AEs  
• A pre -existing condition  is one that is present at the start of the study .  A pre -
existing condition should be recorded as an AE if the frequency, intensity, or the 
character of the condition worsens during the study period.  
• At the end of the study, any new clinically significant findings/abnormalities that 
meet the definition of an AE must also be recorded and doc umented as an AE.  
12.1.1.1.  Severity  Assessment  
The investigator or the designated person will provide an assessment of the severity of each 
AE by recording a severity rating on the appropriate AE reporting page of the subject’s CRF .  
In classification of AEs, the t erm “severe” is not the same as “serious” .  Severity is a 
description of the intensity of a specific event .  The term “serious” relates to a subject/event 
outcome or action criteria, usually associated with events that pose a threat to a subject’s life 
or functioning.  
All adverse events will be graded according to the severity scale below .  General descriptions 
of each severity grade may be found in Table  11. 
Table  11: General Descriptions of Severity Scale 
Severity Scale  General Description s 
Mild  Asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; 
intervention not indicated; The AE is easily tolerated and does not interfere with 
daily activities.  
Moderate  Minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; The AE interferes with 
daily activities, but the subject is still able to function.  
Severe  Not immediately life-threatening; hospitalization or prolongation of 
hospitalization indicated; disabling; The AE is incapacitating and requires 
medical intervention.  
Every effort will be made to obtain an adequate evaluation of the severity.

 12.1.1.2.  Causality Assessment  
An asse ssment should be made of the causal relationship  of the adverse event to the study 
treatment, i.e., according to the following definitions  in Table 12. 
Table 12: Definitions of Causality Assessment  
Causality 
Assessment  Definitions  
Unrelated  The event is occurring before dosing  
The event is definitely produced  by the subject’s clinical state or by other modes of 
therapy administered to subject  
Remote  The event does not follow a reasonable (poor) temporal relationship with drug 
treatment  
And/or the event is readily explained by the subject’s clinical state or b y other 
modes of therapy administered to subject  
Possible  Reasonable temporal relationship with drug treatment  
But the event could have been produced by the subject’s clinical state or by other 
modes of therapy administered to subject  
Probable  Reasonable temporal relationship with drug treatment, abates upon discontinuation 
of drug  
And/or event cannot be reasonably explained by the known characteristics of the 
subject’s clinical state.  
Definite  Distinct temporal relationship with drug treatment , abates upon discontinuation of 
drug (de -challenge) and is confirmed by reappearance of the reaction on repeat 
exposure (re -challenge)  
Adverse events must be followed until resolution by the Principal Investigator .  Resolution is 
defined as the return to baseline status or stabilization of the condition with the expectation 
that it will remain chronic .  Adverse events that are not serious and are ongoing at the 
subject’s last visit will be followed for a maximum of 30 days .  Serious adverse event s that 
are not resolved or stabilized during this time period will be followed until resolution or 
stabilization.  
12.1.2.  Routine Reporting  
For the purposes of this study, the period of observation of adverse events for each subject 
extends from the signing of the  informed consent form until their last visit  including the 
follow -up visit  or early termination, whichever is longer .   
All events reported by the subject, observed by  the clinical staff (events , such as abnormal, 
clinically significant findings from phys ical examinations, ECG tracings, laboratory 
assessments, and vital sign measurements), or elicited by general questioning will be 
recorded in the Institution’s source document and reported as an adverse event and captured 
in the adverse events CRF .  If nec essary, every effort will be made to obtain an adequate 
SK Life Sc ience, Inc.             IND No. 141225  
SKL24741                                                                  Protocol SKL24741C001 - Amendment 3.0  
91 
 follow -up of the subjects .  Should any subject choose to withdraw early from the study, they 
will be advised of the safety precautions to be taken.  
Early Termination and End of Study ( EOS) visit asses sments should be performed , including 
the following: medical history, vital signs, physical exam, safety and clinical laboratory tests, 
ECG, peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR), Columbia -Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS), 
and adverse event/concomitant mo nitoring.  
Subjects will be questioned on their health status at the beginning of each visit and before 
their departure from the clinical site .  Open -ended questions will be asked.  
Classification will be performed by System Organ Class (SOC) and Preferred T erm (PT) 
using the  latest version of  Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA)  at the 
start of the study.  
In general, AEs occurring secondary to other events (e.g., clinical sequelae or a cascade of 
events) should be identified by their primary  cause .  For example, if severe vomiting is 
known to result in dehydration, it is sufficient to record only vomiting as SAE or AE in the 
CRF .  However, medically significant AEs occurring secondary to an initiating event that are 
separated in time should be recorded as independent events on the CRF .   
12.1.3.  Serious Adverse Reporting  
The investigator or any other study center personnel’s knowledge will notify any SAEs 
including fatal or life -threatening to SK Life Science, Inc . (SKLSI) and their designee 
IQVIA  on an SAE report form , without regard to causality, within 24  hours after becoming 
aware of its occurrence.  
If, during follow -up, any non -serious AE worsens and eventually meets the criteria for an 
SAE, that AE should be recorded as a new SAE.  
The in itial SAE report must be as complete as possible, including details of the current illness 
and SAE, and an assessment of the causal relationship between the event and the 
investigational product .  Information not available at the time of the initial report  (e.g., an 
end date for the AE, laboratory values received after the report, or hospital discharge 
summary) must be documented and an updated SAE report form should be forwarded to the 
Sponsor  and their designee IQVIA  within 24 hours of new/updated informa tion.  All follow -

At the time of the initial SAE report, the investigator should provide as much of the 
following information as possible:  
• Study identifier  
• Study site  
• Subject  number  
• A description of the event  
• Date of onset  
• Current Status  
• Whether study drug was discontinued  
• The reason why the event is classified as serious  
• Investigator’s assessment of the association between the event and study drug  
The Sponsor  will be responsible for evaluating the events for expedited reporting, and for 
reporting them to the applicable regulatory agencies.  
If reports of any new and unexpec ted AEs become available to the Sponsor  during the 
clinical portion of this study (related or not to the present study), the Sponsor  has to advise 
the clinical site, through its Principal Investigator, of those events.   
12.1.4.  Laboratory Results as Adverse Events  
The determination of whether laboratory test results are clinically significant should be made 
by a physician or by a clinical study staff member (listed on Form FDA 1572) who is 
qualified to review  and assess laboratory tests .  This determination is impo rtant, as a 
clinically significant laboratory abnormality must be associated with an adverse event, either 
directly or indirectly as explained below.  
SK Life Sc ience, Inc.             IND No. 141225  
SKL24741                                                                  Protocol SKL24741C001 - Amendment 3.0  
93 
 The criteria for determining whether an abnormal laboratory test finding should be clinically 
significant  are as follows:  
Test result is associated with clinical signs or symptoms .  If the signs or symptoms are 
related to a diagnosis that has already been documented as an adverse event, the lab 
abnormality itself generally does not have to be reported as an a dditional adverse event (e.g., 
hyperglycemia with an adverse event of new -onset diabetes; if diabetes is documented as an 
adverse event, hyperglycemia does not need to be documented separately as it is a common 
finding as part of the diabetes diagnosis) . 
Test result requires additional diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention . 
Test result leads to a change in study drug dosing or to discontinuation from the study . 
Test result is considered by the investigator to be an adverse event (i.e., any new  unfavorable 
sign/symptom, or previous condition that has increased in severity or frequency during the 
study) .   
Laboratory abnormalities that are associated with a chronic, stable medical condition (e.g., 
slightly elevated ALT in a subject with hepatitis  C that is unchanged or decreased from 
baseline) do not have to be considered clinically significant, but this judgment is left to the 
investigator.  
Note that repeating a test to confirm an abnormal result, in the absence of any of the above, 
does not mean  that a lab m ust be clinically significant .  An abnormal result that is found to be 
in error is not clinically significant and should not be reported as an adverse event.  
12.2. Administrative Requirements  
12.2.1.  Ethical Considerations  
The study will be conducted in acc ordance with the current ICH -GCP Guidelines, which are 
consistent with the ethical principles founded in the Declaration of Helsinki, and according to

the qualifications of each investigator, inspect trial site facilities, and inform the investigator 
of respon sibilities and procedures for ensuring adequate and correct study documentation.  
The investigator is required to prepare and maintain adequate and accurate case histories 
designed to record all observations and other data pertinent to the study for each st udy 
participant .  Study data for each enrolled subject will be entered into an eCRF by site 
personnel  using a secure, validated web -based electronic data capture (EDC) application 
(Section 12.5).  
Study monitors will discuss instances of missing or uninterpretable data with the i nvestigator 
for resolution .  Any changes to study data will be  made to the eCRF and do cumented via a 
database query .  An audit trail for all changes will be maintained within the clinical database.  
Study monitors will discuss instances of missing or uninterpretable data with th e investigator 
for resolution .  Any changes to study data will be made to the eCRF and documented v ia an 
electronic audit trail associated with the affected eCRF.

 12.5. Electronic Data Capture  
The Sponsor  or designee will ensure secure access to and training on the EDC application, 
sufficient to permit site personnel to enter or correct  information in the eCRFs for the 
subjects for which they are responsible.  
The eCRFs will be completed for each study sub ject.  It is the investigator’s responsibility to 
ensure the accuracy, completeness, clarity, and timeliness of the data reported in the subject’s 
eCRF .  Source documentation supporting the eCRF data should indicate the subject’s 
participation in the study  and should document the dates and details of study procedures, 
adverse events, other observations, and subject status.  
The investigator, or designated representative, should complete the eCRF as soon as possible 
after information is collected .  An explana tion should be provided for all missing data.  
The audit trail entry will show the user’s identification information, and the date and time of 
the correction .  Investigators must provide through the EDC application formal approval of 
all the information in the eCRFs and changes to the eCRFs to endorse the final submitted 
data for the subjects for which they are responsible.  
The Sponsor  or designee will retain the eCRF data  and corresponding audit trails .  A copy of 
the final archival eCRF in the form of a C D or other electronic media will be placed in the 
investigator’s study file.

    Assessment Period:   
The study drug will be administered in the morning of Day 1, Day 22, and Day 43 for Period 1, 
Period 2, and Period 3, respectively. Study drug will be administered after all pre -dose 
assessments have been comp leted. The subjects will stay at the clinical site until Day  4, Day 25, 
and Day 46 for Period 1, Period 2, and Period 3, respectively. The subjects will be discharged after completion of all scheduled assessments. Outpatient visits will be performed as out lined in 
Table  4.  
 
Follow -up:  
A follow -up visit will be performed on Day 69 (±1 day)  
 
Refer to the Schedule of Assessments ( Table  4) for further details . 
Reference therapy, dosage and mode of administration:  
Treatment A: Oral Dose of cenobamate administered as a single 200 mg tablet on Day 1 under fas ted 
conditions  
Treatment B: Oral Dose of cenobamate administered as a single 200  mg/20  mL suspension on Day 1 
under fasted conditions  
Treatment C: Oral Dose of cenobamate administered as a single 200  mg/20  mL suspension on Day 1  
under fed conditions  
Evaluation : 
Pharmacokinetics :  
Serial blood samples for PK assessments will be sampled at various time points from Day  1, Day 22, 
and Day 43 starting at pre -dose through 456  hours (20  days) following oral administration of 
cenobamate tablets or  suspension (See Table  4). 
The PK samples may be used for additional exploratory PK and/or metabolite analyses.  
Descriptive statistics and graphs will be generated for plasma concentrations and PK parameters for 
each treatment.  
The formulation effect will be tested for: Cenobamate oral suspension administered under fed and 
fasting conditions and cenobamate oral tablet administered under fasting conditions. These analyses 
will be conducted separately on C max, AUC last and AUC ∞ using a mixed model on the log 
transformed data with treatment, sequence and period as fixed effects and subject within sequence as 
random effe ct. Geometric mean ratios (GMRs) will be computed for:  
1. Cenobamate oral suspension administered under fasted conditions versus cenobamate oral 
tablet administered under fasting conditions  
2. Cenobamate  oral suspension administered under fed conditions versus cenobamate oral 
suspension administered under fasting conditions  
Additionally, for the above comparisons, the corresponding 90% confidence intervals (90% CIs) will 
be calculated. No formulation effe ct or food interaction will be concluded when the 90% CIs are 
within the reference range [0.80 – 1.25]. For each subject, the Wilcoxon signed- rank test will be used 
to test for differences in tmax.

    5. INTRODUCTION 
5.1. Background  
Cenobamate ( YKP3089) is a small molecule approved in the United States (US) for the 
treatment of partial onset seizures (POS) in adult patients.  
Refer to the most recent version of the Investigator’s Brochure (IB)1 of cenobamate for more 
details.   
5.1.1. Non-Clinical Experience 
Non-clinical testing of cenobamate suggests  a broad spectrum of antiepileptic effects, as well as 
therapeutic potential for treatment of neuropathi c pain, and possible future investigations for 
treatment of anxiety. In in vitro  electrophysiology assays, cenobamate was shown to be an 
inhibitor of the fast and slow inactivated state and persistent current of sodium channels and to 
be a positive alloste ric modulator of 6 GABA A ion channel subtypes (α1β2γ2, α2β3γ2, α3β3γ2, 
α4β3γ2, α5β3γ2 and α6β3γ2).  
Cenobamate has been assessed in a large number of  safety pharmacology and toxicology studies 
including single -dose toxicity, repeat -dose toxicity, cardiotoxicity, genetic toxicity, reproductive 
toxicity, and carcinogenicity in animals. Safety pharmacology studies showed that the doses that 
produced benef icial central nervous system (CNS) effects of cenobamate in animal models do 
not result in obvious negative effects on the CNS. No evidence of cardiovascular effects was observed by telemetric electrocardiography in male monkeys. There was no carcinogenic potential for cenobamate in transgenic rasH2 mice or Sprague Dawley rats.  
Cenobamate is extensively metabolized. The primary metabolic pathways are by glucuronidation via UGT2B7 and to a lesser extent by UGT2B4, and by oxidation via CYP2E1, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, and to a lesser extent by CYP2C19 and CYP3A4/5. 
5.1.2. Clinical Human Experience  
To date, approximately 2500 subjects have been exposed to cenobamate in the clinical 
development program. For further details about the completed and ongoing clinical studies, pleas e refer to the most recent version of the Investigator Brochure
1.  
5.1.2.1. Clinical Pharmacokinetics  
In humans, the pharmacokinetics (PK) of cenobamate has bee n studied after both single dose and 
multiple dosing in healthy subjects. The PK of cenobamate in plasma appears to be non-proportional after single oral doses ranging from 5 to 750 mg and multiple dosing ranging from 
50 to 500 mg/day. Maximum plasma conce ntration of cenobamate was generally observed 
between 1 - and 4- hours post dosing and a longer terminal half -life was observed as the 
cenobamate dose was increased (approximately 30 hours at 5- 10 mg to approximately 76 hours 
at 750 mg). Steady state is gene rally achieved after 2 weeks of treatment with once daily dosing 
of cenobamate, and the accumulation of cenobamate in plasma over the 50 -300 mg dose range 
was approximately 5- fold based on total exposure (AUC).
2 
Cenobamate is extensively metabolized and primarily eliminated in the urine (88% of the dose).3 
The disposition of cenobamate  following tablet administration  is not affected by food. The intra -
YKP3089  Protocol No. YKP3089C037 
 30  
    subject variability of cenobamate in healthy subjects is relatively low (about 14% for C max and 4-
5% for AUCs). No pharmacokinetic difference was obser ved for cenobamate between Japanese 
and non- Japanese healthy subjects.  
Multiple drug- drug interaction (DDI) studies were performed in healthy subjects. The 
coadministration of carbamazepine, divalproex and oral contraceptives did not significantly 
modify t he PK of cenobamate whereas the coadministration of phenobarbital and phenytoin 
significantly decreased cenobamate plasma exposure (AUC) by approximately 15% and 28%, 
respectively. The coadministration of cenobamate significantly decreased carbamazepine pl asma 
exposure (AUC) by approximately 25- 35%, and increased phenobarbital and phenytoin plasma 
exposures (AUC) by approximately 37% and 84%, respectively. The coadministration of cenobamate with oral contraceptives did not significantly modify ethinylestradiol plasma 
exposure (AUC) but increased slightly the exposure to norethindrone by approximately 37% for 
cenobamate oral doses up to 100 mg/day. 
After the administration of a CYP450 probe cocktail with cenobamate in healthy subjects, the 
results showed that  a 200 mg daily dose of cenobamate induced the activity of CYP2B6 and 
inhibited the activity of CYP2C19. For CYP3A, cenobamate exhibited a limited induction at 100 
mg/day whereas a more marked induction was observed at 200 mg/day. No significant effect of 
cenobamate was observed on CYP2C9 activity at 200 mg/day. 
The effect of renal impairment on the PK of cenobamate led to an increase in plasma exposure to 
cenobamate by 1.4- fold and 1.5- fold in mild and moderate renal impaired subjects, respectively. 
The ef fect of hepatic impairment on the PK of cenobamate led to an increase in plasma exposure 
to cenobamate by 1.9 -fold and 2.3- fold in mild and moderate hepatic impaired subjects, 
respectively. No clinical meaningful effect of sex or age is expected on the PK of cenobamate.  
5.1.2.2. Clinical Safety  
Cenobamate at oral doses of 100 mg and 200 mg/day was generally well tolerated with a 
predictable and consistent adverse event (AE) profile. Cenobamate at a dose of 400 mg/day required more frequent dose reductions because of  CNS related AEs and resulted in a higher 
frequency of discontinuations due to AEs. The median of the modal dose in the 400 mg arm of 
Study YKP3089C017 was 300 mg/day. Adverse events (AEs) resolved upon discontinuation of 
cenobamate.  
The most common advers e events (AEs) reported with cenobamate in adults were mild to 
moderate in severity. CNS -related AEs were dose dependent, with higher incidence reported at 
higher doses. Adverse reactions due to cenobamate may include somnolence, dizziness, fatigue, headache, diplopia, nausea, nystagmus, balance disorder, and gait ataxia. These adverse reactions 
were mild to moderate in severity and resolved spontaneously upon discontinuation of treatment. 
SAEs considered at least possibly related to cenobamate included drug reaction with eosinophilia 
and systemic reaction, dizziness, vertigo, ataxia, dysarthria, nystagmus (2 subjects), and suicidal 
ideation (2 subjects). A complete list of all SAEs during the cenobamate development program is 
available in the IB.
1 The SAEs reported with cenobamate reflect an expected pattern with 
therapy with multiple AEDs.  
In subjects taking cenobamate, the most common serious AEs (SAEs) were CNS related such as 
hospitalization for seizures, ataxia and dizziness particularly at hi gher dosages. These serious 
YKP3089  Protocol No. YKP3089C037 
 31  
    adverse events have been readily clinically identifiable. The general nature of these SAEs 
reflects an expected pattern in subjects with epilepsy. 
Adverse events (AEs) of special interest that emerged during the cenobamate devel opment 
program include rash and hypersensitivity reactions (including three cases of DRESS syndrome) 
with elevations of hepatic enzymes. Drug- induced hypersensitivity reactions with or without 
multi organ involvement (allergic reactions which may be fatal)  including DRESS syndrome 
have been seen in patients taking cenobamate. DRESS which has occurred in <0.5% of clinical trial participants taking cenobamate stands for Drug Reaction (or Rash) with Eosinophilia and 
Systemic Symptoms. This condition occurs usually in the first 8 weeks after initiation of treatment and rarely happens afterwards. In a large open label safety trial of 1339 subjects 
exposed to cenobamate at an initial dose of 12.5mg/day and titrated every two weeks to a 
maximum dose of 400mg /day no cases of DRESS were identified.  
Although two cases of highly elevated hepatic enzymes were identified, there were no cases that 
met the criteria for Hy’s Law and review of the cenobamate safety database revealed that the 
incidence of 3X 
upper l imit of no rmal (ULN)  elevation of alanine a minotransferase  (ALT ) did not 
meet the criteria for the Rezulin Rule. One of the subjects with highly elevated hepatic enzymes 
died of multi -organ failure with pancreatic, cardiac and pulmonary failure approximately one 
year after starting cenobamate and one month after initiating eslicarbazepine. Final diagnosis 
was sepsis. The other case had elevated hepatic enzymes in conjunction with DRESS syndrome. Hepatic enzymes are carefully monitored in all clinical trials.  
It is kn own that antiepileptic drugs increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior in patients 
taking these drugs for any indication. Although isolated reports of suicidal thoughts and behavior 
have been reported in studies with cenobamate, the relationship between them and cenobamate 
has not been confirmed. Patients treated in cenobamate studies are monitored for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior.  
A complete list of all SAEs  during the cenobamate development program is included in the 
current version of the IB
1. The general nature of these SAEs reflects an expected pattern  in 
subjects with epilepsy. 
5.2. Benefit-Risk Assessment  
This Phase 1 study in healthy volunteers has no direct benefit to the participating subjects. 
The results of two adequate and well -controlled studies demonstrated that 100, 200 and 400 
mg/day of cenobamate are effective for the treatment of partial onset seizures. The most common 
AEs were nervous system and gastrointestinal disorders. Adverse event s were consistent, 
predictable, and dose related. The primary safety issue identified was DRESS syndrome. Using a 
low starting dose and titration every two weeks appears to have mitigated this issue. 
Additionally, DRESS has not been reported in any cenobam ate single dose study to date. These 
safety issues are readily identifiable with a predictable course and resolved with discontinuation 
of cenobamate. Safety profile of cenobamate is comparable with other drugs in this class. 
Considering the measures taken to minimize risks to patients participating in clinical trials, the potential risks identified in association with cenobamate are justified by the anticipated benefits that may be afforded to patients with partial onset epilepsy. 
YKP3089  Protocol No. YKP3089C037 
 32  
    Any subject who reports a  rash or has a developing cutaneous reaction should be carefully 
evaluated for a drug hypersensitivity syndrome. The evaluation should include hematology and 
chemistry blood tests. If a subject reports a rash by telephone, an unscheduled visit should be performed as soon as possible. Investigators and coordinators must remind study subjects about 
the possibility of allergic reaction including rash. 
Hepatic enzymes will be carefully monitored to detect any potential liver toxicity.  
The subjects in this clinical study will receive single oral doses of 200 mg of cenobamate at 3 
occasions in fasting or fed conditions administered as either a tablet or suspension formulation. 
Thus, the overall risk to the subjects enrolled in this study is deemed acceptable. Neve rtheless, 
the subjects will be closely monitored using frequent clinical laboratory investigations and a continuous observation of their well -being.  
5.3. Rationale for Present Study  
5.3.1. Study Design Rationale  
A new oral suspension formulation of cenobamate has rece ntly been developed and will be used 
to support the cenobamate pediatric clinical program. Since a suspension formulation has not 
been used in any clinical trials to date, the pharmacokinetics (PK) of the suspension formulation 
will be investigated and com pared to tablet formulation. The relative BA assessment between 
these 2 formulations will be performed using a single 200 mg dose of cenobamate. Additionally, 
a food effect on the PK of the suspension formulation will be evaluated in this study. These 2 
assessments with the suspension formulation will provide the needed information to use 
appropriately the oral suspension formulation in future clinical studies conducted in pediatric populations. 
5.3.2. Anticipated Pharmacokinetic Behavior 
5.3.2.1. Food Effect on Cenobamate  Suspension  
A previous clinical study conducted in healthy volunteers assessing the relative bioavailability of 
an oral tablet formulation of cenobamate administered in fasting and fed conditions showed no 
statistically significant difference in the pharma cokinetics of cenobamate between the fed and 
fasted populations. As such, it is expected that the disposition of cenobamate will be comparable 
with the suspension formulation. 
5.3.2.2. Relative Bioavailability Between Cenobamate Suspension and Cenobamate 
Tablet  
The disposition of cenobamate has been previously studied after the administration of different 
oral formulations (capsule and tablet). No statistically significant differences were observed in 
the pharmacokinetics of cenobamate between these formulations. However, an oral suspension 
of cenobamate has not been tested in clinical studies to date. Therefore, the disposition of 
cenobamate as an oral liquid formulation is unknown.

7.1. Overall Study Design  
This study is an open- label, randomized, single -dose, single -center, three -period, six -sequence, 
balanced crossover study in which healthy subjects, balanced amongst gender and ethnic groups 
to the extent possible, will receive either a single oral 200 mg dose of cenobamate given as a 
tablet under fasted conditions (Treatment A), a single oral 200 mg dose of cenobamate given as an oral suspension under fasted conditions (Treatm ent B), or a single oral 200 mg dose of 
cenobamate given as an oral suspension under fed conditions (Treatment C). All subjects will be screened to ensure that inclusion and exclusion criteria are met. The study will be explained to each subject prior to providing written informed consent. 
The study will consist of a screening period followed by a dosing period where each subject will

YKP3089  Protocol No. YKP3089C037 
45 
    7.3.1. Methods for Treatment Group Assignment  
After obtaining oral and written informed consent, subjects will be s creened according to the 
inclusion and exclusion criteria (Section 8.1 and Section  8.2). Prior to dosing on Day 1, subjects 
will be randomized to receive one of three treatment schemes as outlined in Table 3. The 
randomization schedule will be generated by the statistician responsible for this study using 
SAS® software. One copy of the randomization list will be provided to the pharmacist for 
preparation of the appropriate treatment. Subjects withdra wn from the study retain their 
randomization number, if already given. New subjects must always be allotted a new 
randomization number. Once assigned, randomization numbers must not be reused within the 
study site. 
Subjects who drop- out for any reason or w ithdraw consent prior to dosing will be considered as 
screen failures. Such subjects will not receive a unique subject number. The Investigator will 
keep a screening log of all screen failure subjects, along with the reasons for their screen failure.  
7.3.2. Alloc ation of Subject Numbers  
Once a subject has signed the ICF, that subject will be assigned an 8- digit subject identification 
number (subject ID) e.g. 01001001. The first two digits is for country, the next 3 digits for site, 
and the last 3 digits for subjec t. Subject numbers will be allocated sequentially in the order in 
which the subjects are screened. Once assigned, subject identification numbers must not be reused. The subject number will ensure identification throughout the study.  
Subjects withdrawn from the study will retain their subject identification numbers. Any 
replacement subject will receive the subject number from the subject they are replacing + 100, 
e.g., replacement for 01001003 would have the subject identification number 01001103.  
Subjects  who fail screening will be allowed to re -screen only once. The re -screened subject will 
be assigned a new subject number, and the linking information for these two subject numbers will be recorded in CRF.  
7.4. Dose Adjustment Criteria  
The dose will not be adju sted in this study.  
7.4.1. Safety Criteria for Adjustment or Stopping Doses  
The dose of this study will not be adjusted. However, the Investigator may withdraw a subject at 
any time if it is determined that continuing the study would result in a significant safety risk to 
the subject.  
Subjects will be discontinued from the clinical study for any of the following reasons:  
• Females who are pregnant according to a positive pregnancy test, 
• Positive screening of alcohol and/or drugs of abuse, 
• If following the first dose , a subject develops any rash related to the study drug. 
Furthermore, participation in the clinical study could be discontinued by the Investigator in charge of the study or by SKLSI for any of the following reasons:  
YKP3089  Protocol No. YKP3089C037 
46 
    • Clinically significant abnormality on vital signs, clinical laboratory, or physical 
examination assessments, as assessed by the investigator or designee,  
• Rash or manifestation of hypersensitivity reaction such as lymphadenopathy, fever, or facial swelling related to the study dr ugs, 
• Noncompliance with the protocol requirements (e.g., blood collection deviations which may impact the PK profile),  
• The subject is uncooperative during the study, 
• Occurrence of intolerable adverse event (AE),  
• Lost to follow -up, 
• Unanticipated event which  could result in an inadequately characterized PK profile, 
such as missed blood draws, AE, or need to use concomitant medications. 
If a subject prematurely discontinues, or is discontinued from the study, the primary reason for the discontinuation will be obtained and recorded on the CRF.  
Replacement subjects may be added at SKLSI’s discretion, in agreement with the investigator. 
7.4.2. Pharmacokinetic Criteria for Adjustment or Stopping Doses  
There are no pre- defined Pharmacokinetic criteria for adjusting or stopping doses. Subject 
termination will be governed by safety, tolerability and Investigator discretion.  
7.5. Criteria for Study Termination  
SK Life Science, Inc.  (SKLSI) may te rminate the study at any time. For reasonable cause, either 
the Investigator or  the IRB may terminate the study as well. Conditions that may warrant 
termination include,  but are not limited to: 
• subjec t or investigator noncompliance,  
• unsatisfactory subject enrollment,  
• lack of adherence to protocol procedures,  
• lack of evaluable and/or comple te data,  
• potentially unac ceptable risk to study subjects, 
• decision to modify drug development plan,  
• decision by the FDA or other regulatory authority.  
Written notification that includes the reason for the protocol termination is required.

eligible for participation in this study. The study population will consist of a balanced 
representation of genders and ethnic groups to the extent possible.  
Adherence to the study design requirements, including those specified in the schedule of 
assessments ( Table 4), is essential and required for study conduct. Continued eligibility will be 
assessed upon entry into the clinic prior to the start of each visit.  
All screening evaluations must be completed and reviewed to confirm that potential subjects meet all eligibility criteria. The subject’s selected by the clinical site will be reviewed by SKLSI for 
final approval. The investigator will maintain a screening log in order to record details of all 
screened subjects and to confirm eligibility or record reasons for screening failure, as applicable.  
Subjects may be re- screened only once within an appropriate time window in case of out of range 
results.

 49  
    
 17. History of   Familial S hort QT syndrome.  
8.3. Subject Withdrawal Criteria  
Any subject may be withdrawn from the study at the discretion of the Investigator. The subject is 
also free to terminate his/her participation at any time. However, if the subject has been dosed with study medication, it is recommended to ask the subject to remain in contact with the center, 
and the investigational site should make every effort to convince the subject to return for a safety 
follow-up visit. The Investigator will also undertake to obtain more detailed information about 
any subject lost to follow -up. Subjects withdrawn from the study must not be re -included.  
8.3.1. Withdrawn Subject Data Collection  
The principal Investigator and/or desi gnee will document on the termination page of the CRF 
and in the subject’s medical records the primary reason for the subject’s withdrawal as follows:  
• Lost to follow -up: subjects who leave the clinic during the hospitalization period or 
do not attend the f ollowing visit. Intensive efforts should be made to locate and recall 
them if possible and, at a minimum, to determine their health status; 
• AE: an AE form must be completed; the type of AE should be specified;  
• Deviation from protocol;  
• Consent withdrawn;  
• Other: if none of the above -mentioned reasons are applicable, then the reason will be 
specified.  
All withdrawals will be reported immediately to SKLSI. For all dropouts, a Follow -up visit will 
be arranged for approximately 21 days after the most recent drug administration and will 
document the progress of their condition. In every case, the CRF must be filled in up to the last visit performed.  
8.3.2. Lost to Follow -Up 
A subject will be considered lost to follow -up if he or she fails to return for scheduled visits and 
is unable to be contacted by the study site. The following actions must be taken if a subject fails to return to the clinic for a required study visit:  
• The site must attempt to contact the subject and reschedule the missed visit as soon as 
possible, counsel the subject on the importance of maintaining the assigned visit 
schedule and ascertain whether or not the subject wishes to and/or should continue in 
the study;  
• In cases in which the subject is deemed lost to follow -up, the Investigator or designee 
must make every effort to regain contact with the subject (where possible, 3 telephone 
calls and, if necessary, a certified letter to the subject’s last known mailing address or local equivalent methods). These contact attempts should be documented in the subject’s medical record;  
YKP3089  Protocol No. YKP3089C037 
 
 50  
    
 • Should the subject continue to be unreachable, he/she will be considered to have 
withdrawn from the study with a primary reason of lost to Follow -up. 
8.3.3. Replacement of Subjects  
Subjects who withdraw or are withdrawn during the study for  reasons unrelated to safety may be 
replaced in order to have at least 20 evaluable subjects who completed the 3 treatment periods. In case of replacement, a subject will be assigned to the same treatment sequence as the discontinued subject. 
In case of mo derate or severe AE causing the subject to withdraw, a joint decision between 
SKLSI and the Investigator will be taken on the appropriateness of replacing the subject.

10.5.1. Timing of Doses in the Study  
10.5.1.1. Timing of Doses for Treatment A and Treatment B  
• The study drug will be orally administered to subjects in the morning after a 10- hour 
overnight fast (no food or beverages allowed except for tap wat er).  
• The study drug will be swallowed together with 240 mL tap water (room 
temperature). The study drug should be swallowed whole and should not be chewed.  
• Administration of the study drug will be supervised by the Investigator or designee. 
After drug adm inistration, a mouth and hand inspection will take place.  
• Fasting will continue until approximately 4 hours post -dose when lunch will be 
served.  
• Subjects will also be instructed not to drink fluids over a period extending from 2 
hours prior to 2 hours aft er study drug administration, except water used for study 
drug administration. 
• A dinner will be provided approximately 10 hours after dosing.  
10.5.1.2. Timing of Doses for Treatment C  
• The study drug will be orally administered to subjects in the morning approximately 30 minutes after the start of a high- calorie, high- fat meal.  
• The study drug will be swallowed together with 240 mL tap water (room temperature). The study drug should be s wallowed whole. 
• Administration of the study drug will be supervised by the Investigator or designee. 
After drug administration, a mouth and hand inspection will take place.  
• A lunch and dinner will be served approximately 4 hours and 10 hours post -dose, 
respectively.  
10.5.2. High -Calorie,  High -Fat Meal for Treatment C  
Subjects that are taking the oral suspension formulation under fed conditions (Treatment C) will 
be given a high- calorie (approximately 800 – 1000 calories) and high- fat (approximately 50% of 
total cal oric content of the meal) meal as recommended by the FDA.
4 This meal should derive 
approximately 150, 250, and 500 – 600 calories from protein, carbohydrate, and fat, respectively. 
For instance, the breakfast can contain 2 eggs fried in butter, 2 strips of bacon, 2 slices of toast 
with butter, 4 ounces of hash brown potatoes and 8 ounces of whole milk. Substitutions in this 
test breakfast can be made pro vided that the meal provides a similar amount of calories from 
protein, carbohydrate, and fat and has comparable meal volume and viscosity. The final composition of the breakfast will be reported in the clinical study report.

 Subjects receiving the high ca lorie, high- fat breakfast will need to adhere to the following 
schedule:  
• The meal will be taken about 30 minutes prior to the administration of cenobamate,  
• The meal should be eaten within 30 minutes or less, 
• Cenobamate will be administered approximat ely 30 minutes after the start of the meal.  
Water will be allowed ad libitum except for one hour before and after cenobamate 
administration, with the exception of the 240 mL of water taken with each dose. 
 
10.6. Study Drug Accountability  
The Investigator is responsible for confirming that all study drug supplies received by the study 
site are inventoried and accounted for throughout the study. A drug receipt log will be completed 
and signed by the person accepting the shipment. It is impor tant that the designated study site 
personnel count and verify that the shipment contains all the items noted in the shipment 
inventory. Any damaged study drug found in a given shipment will be documented in the study files. The Investigator must notify the SKLSI of any damaged or unusable study drug supplies. 
10.7. Study Drug Handling and Disposal  
Upon destruction of study drug, a Certificate of Destruction  (COD)  will be provided to SKLSI. 
See the Pharmacy Manual for drug handling and disposal. The clinical site  will be responsible 
for cenobamate drug disposal.

 11. PHARMACOKINETIC ASSESSMENTS  
11.1. Blood Sample Collection  
Blood samples for determination of cenobamate plasma concentrations will be collected by 
direct venipuncture into a labeled tube containing the appropria te anticoagulant as specified by 
the bioanalytical facilities. If judged necessary by the clinical staff, blood samples may be collected from an indwelling cannula (catheter).  
The complete schedule for pharmacokinetic blood sampling is presented in Table 4. The time of 
blood sample collection will be calculated according to the treatment administration schedule. 
The clock time of the dose administration wi ll be recorded (record time after all drug products 
have been swallowed). The exact actual time of blood draws will be recorded and reported for all 
subjects in the CRF. Actual blood collection times will be used for the PK analysis. Blood will 
be collected into tubes labeled with the nominal blood sampling times.  
It is important to avoid hemolysis during blood collection. In case of hemolysis, this will be 
reported in the CRF. The impact of any observed hemolysis on the plasma concentrations may be 
discuss ed with SKLSI.  
When a sampling time is close to a mealtime, the sample will be collected before the meal.  
Blood samples for PK analysis should be collected at the requested times, but the allowed windows for sample collection are presented in Table 6.  
Table  6: Acceptable Time Windows for PK Blood Sampling  
Nominal Sampling Time  Acceptable Time Windows  
Pre-dose -30 mins before dose or immediately before dosing  
0.25 to 1.5 hour post -dose ± 2 minutes

 11.2. Urine Sample Collection  
Urine will not be collected for PK assessment in this Study.  
11.3. Sample Analysis  
11.3.1. Sample Processing and Handling for PK Assessment  
Detailed procedures for the sample collection, processing and handling for PK assessment will 
be provided in a separate document (i.e., Laboratory Manual). The shipment address and assay 
lab contact information will be provided to the investigational site prior to initiation of the trial.  
11.3.2. Bioanalysis  
Blood samples will be processed, split, stored, and shipped according to the sample processing manuals supplied by the bioanalytical facilities.  
Plasma s amples will be analyzed for cenobamate concentrations using a validated liquid 
chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry method (LC -MS/MS) with a lower limit of 
quantification of 0.05 μg/mL. 
The method, data acceptance criteria, and criteria for sample re -assay will follow the 
bioanalytical facility’s SOPs and the guidelines set by the Regulatory Agencies. 
Pharmacokinetic sample analysis methods are further explained in Section  13.1.3.  
PK blood samples may be used for metabolite or methodology exploratory analyses. Possible 
results from these exploratory analyses may be reported in standalone report(s) if deemed necessary.  
11.3.3. Exploratory Pharmacogenomic Asses sments  
At the time point defined in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 4), an optional blood sample 
will be collected to explore the possible effect of g enetic variation in the PK of cenobamate. A 
separate informed consent for genotyping will be obtained from each subject prior to sampling. 
DNA will be extracted from the blood sample in order to sequence genes coding for enzymatic or transporter systems  that are involved in the absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion 
(ADME) of drugs. The gene sequences to be determined include known and likely functional variations of key ADME genes and incorporate more than 90% of ADME -related genetic 
markers id entified by the PharmaADME group (weblink.pharmaadme.org). It is not intended to 
include the pharmacogenomic data in the final CSR. However, this may be considered if deemed necessary. Possible results from these exploratory analyses may be reported in sta ndalone 
report(s) if deemed necessary.

 12. ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY  
12.1. Safety Parameters  
Safety assessments will include physical examination, vital signs, safety laboratory tests, 
continuous AE monitoring, C -SSRS review  and concomitant medication recording. Additional 
safety measurements may be performed at the discretion of the Investigator for reasons related to subject safety.  
Clinically significant physical examination findings prior to the first dose of the study treatment 
will be recorded as part of the medical  history. Clinically significant findings after the first dose 
will be recorded as AEs.  
The procedures and associated collection windows for vital signs will be as follows:  
• On days that drug product is administered, within 2 hours for pre -dose assessments 
(Days 1, 22, and 43).  
• ± 10 minutes for post -dose assessments (Days 4, 6, 9, 12, 16, 20, 25, 27, 30, 33, 37, 
41, 46, 48, 51, 54, 58, 62 and 69).  
Unless otherwise stated in this protocol, the clinical site’s standard operating procedures (SOPs), 
which are av ailable for all activities relevant to the quality of the study, will be followed during 
this study.  
The study procedures to be conducted for each subject in the study are detailed in Table 4.  
The order of the assessments when scheduled at the same theoretical time will be as follows:  
1. Vital signs;  
2. PK blood sampling;  
3. Blood and urine sampling for safety laboratory assays;  
4. Symptom oriented physical examination.  
Any deviation from the protocol procedures will be captured in the protocol deviation tracker and filed in the  Transfer Master File (TMF ). 
12.1.1. Adverse Events  
All AEs which occur during the clinical study will be reported in detail in the source do cuments 
and documented in the eCRF from Screening, throughout the clinical conduct until the final follow -up visit. SAEs will be continuously monitored starting after the time of informed consent 
through the follow -up visit. The Investigator should follow all unresolved AEs until the events 
have resolved or have stabilized, the subject is lost to follow -up, or it has been determined that 
the AE is not related to study drug or study participation. Outcome of AEs (and resolution date, 
if applicable) should be  documented on the appropriate eCRF page(s) and in the subject’s 
medical record.  
Detailed information about intensity, relationship to study drug, expectedness, serious ness 
criteria, follow -up and reporting of AEs and SAEs are provided in the further secti ons 
(Section  12.2 to Section  12.5 ).

 Special  attention must be given to findings and symptoms related to rash and/or hypersensitivity 
that might be linked to DRESS (Drug Rash with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms) 
syndrome. For details, see Section  12.5.3) . 
Pregnancy of female subjects and female partners of male subjects will be monitored along with follow -up, if warranted (s ee Section  12.1.7.7) . 
 
12.1.2. Demographic/Medical History  
The medical history will include evaluation at Screening of ears, nose, and throat, and will 
comprise any ophthalmological, cardiovascular, respiratory, musculoskeletal, gastrointestinal, 
genitourinary, neurological, endocrine, psychiatric, immunological or allergic, dermatological, and hematological disease, and family history disorder. All findings on medical history will be evaluated by the Investigator  for clinical significance.  
12.1.3. Vital Signs  
Vital sign measurements (oral body temperature, pulse rate, respiratory rate and blood pressure) are specified in Table 4. 
Blood pressure, pulse rate, and respiratory rate will be measured after being in supine position for at least 5 minutes. The allowable time frame for collecting pre -dose vital signs is within 2 
hours prior to dosing. 
Vital signs can also be monitored at any time during the study when judged necessary by the Investigator.  
12.1.4. Suicidality Assessment   
The Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS) is a brief questionnaire that provides for 
the identification, quantification, and standardized assessme nt of the occurrences and severity of 
suicidal ideation and behavior. The “Baseline/Screening Version” of the C -SSRS will be 
assessed at Screening. The C -SSRS “Since Last Visit” version will be assessed on Day - 1,20, 41 
and 69, as specified in Table  4 of the  Schedule Of Asses sments . 
12.1.5. Weight and Height  
Height will only be recorded at the Screening visit. Weight will be measured, and BMI will be calculated at time points indicated in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 4 ). 
12.1.6. Physical Examination  
A complete physical examination consisting of a review of all body systems and a symptom -
directed physical examination will be performed at time points indicated in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 4). A sy mptom -directed physical examination may be conducted at any time 
per Investigator’s discretion.  
Demographic data (date of birth, gender, race, and ethnicity), and alcohol and smoking habits 
will be recorded in the site’s source document at the Screening V isit.

12.1.8.7. Pregnancy  
Please refer to Table 8 for pregnancy tests to be collected throughout the study at times specified in Table 4. 
Pregnancy  in a female subject i n the study shall be reported to the Medical Monitor, SK Life 
Science, Inc. (SKLSI), and  IQVIA  on the Pregnancy Reporting Form, faxing and emailing the 
form as per the Table of Contact ( Table 12 to Table 14) , within 24 hours of the knowledge of its 
occurrence by the Investigator or designee (for pregnancies occurring during the course of the 
study or immediately following the end of the study). Pregnancy in itself is not regarded as an 
AE, unless there is a s uspicion that an investigational product may have interfered with the 
effectiveness of a contraceptive medication. The Investigator must discuss with the medical 
monitor/Sponsor, in conjunction with the Institutional Board (IRB), whether or not it would be  
appropriate for the subject to continue in the study. Because of the possibility that the fetus/embryo could have been exposed to the investigational product through the parent and for the subject’s safety, the pregnancy will be followed up to determine i ts outcome, including 
spontaneous or voluntary termination, details of birth, presence or absence of any birth defects, congenital anomalies, or maternal and/or newborn complications. Pregnancy complications and elective terminations for medical reasons sh ould not be reported as an AE or SAE. All reports of 
congenital abnormalities/birth defects are SAEs. Spontaneous miscarriages should also be reported and handled as SAEs. 
The pregnancy will be recorded on a Pregnancy Form and reported by the Investigator or 
designee to the Sponsor. Pregnancy follow -up will also be properly recorded to ensure quality 
and completeness of the data belonging to the investigational product and will include an 
assessment of the possible causal relation between the investigationa l product and any pregnancy 
outcome. 
12.1.8.8. Contraception for Female Subjects  
Sexually active female subjects of reproductive potential must use an approved method of 
contraception during the entire study and for 30 days after the last dose of study medication. Hormonal contraceptives alone will not be considered an adequate method of contraception.  
Women of childbearing/reproductive potential are defined as: Any female who has experienced menarche and does not meet the criteria for “Women Not of Childbearing Potential” (see below).  
Acceptable contraception methods include:  
• Hormonal contraception (f or at least 3 months prior to the Screening visit) in 
combination with a barrier method;  
• Intrauterine device (placement at least 3 months prior to the Screening visit); 
YKP3089  Protocol No. YKP3089C037 
 
 64  
    
 • Diaphragm with spermicide;  
• Cervical cap;  
• Surgical sterilization (tubal ligation at leas t 6 months prior to the Screening visit or 
partner who has had vasectomy at least 6 months prior to the Screening visit) with 
appropriate medical documentation;  
• Abstinence (however, if the subject becomes sexually active, one of the above methods must be utilized).  
Women not of childbearing potential are defined as women who are postmenopausal or permanently sterilized (e.g., tubal occlusion, hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy). Postmenopausal status is defined as absent menses for at least 12 months and confirmed serum 
follicle -stimulating hormone (FSH) levels equal to or greater than 25.8 mIU/mL at the Screening 
visit.  
12.1.8.9. Contraception for Male Subjects  
Male subjects with female partners of childbearing potential may be enrolled if they are:  
• Surgically ste rile (vasectomy) with appropriate medical documentation;  
• Practicing true abstinence;  
• Using two adequate forms of highly effective contraception including condom with 
spermicide gel/foam/cream and one additional barrier method for subject’s female 
partner l ike hormonal contraception, occlusive cap (cervical cap or diaphragm) with 
spermicide or intrauterine device.  
Contraception methods (including abstinence) must be used by male subjects from the first day 
of dosing through 90 days after the last dose of st udy drug. Subjects whose female partners 
become of child -bearing potential during the study must agree to the contraceptive requirements.  
For male subjects with female partner(s) of non -childbearing potential (i.e., post-menopausal or 
post-surgical sterilization) for at least 6  months before the first dose of study drug, no additional 
contraception method is required.  
12.2. Adverse and Serious Adverse Events  
The site staff will record all AEs observed, queried, or spontaneously reported by the subjects. 
Review of  concomitant medications will occur throughout the study. 
Should subjects choose to withdraw early from the study, they will be advised of the safety precautions that should be taken. The subjects that withdraw early from the study will be contacted by sit e personnel via phone as a follow -up one -week (± 2 days) post discharge or 
withdrawal date.  
Pregnancies identified during the study will be reported to SKLSI with 24 hours. 
YKP3089  Protocol No. YKP3089C037 
 
 65  
    
 12.2.1. Definition s of Adverse Events  
12.2.1.1. Adverse Event (AE)  
An AE  is defined as any untoward m edical occurrence in a subject participating in a clinical 
investigation . This AE  does not necessarily need to have  a causal relationship with the treatment. 
An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign ( e.g., a clinically significant 
abnorma l laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of an 
investigational product, whether or not related to the investigational product. 
An AE may be:  
• A new illness,  
• Worsening of a concomitant illness or a baseline event, 
• An effect of the study treatment; it could be an abnormal laboratory value as well as a 
significant shift from baseline within normal range which the Principal Investigator or 
medical ly qualified designate considers to be clinically important.  
Surgical procedures themselves are not AEs . They are therapeutic measures for conditions that 
required surgery .  The condition for which the surgery is required is an AE, if it occurs or is 
detected during the treatment period.  Planned surgical measures permitted by the clinical study protocol and the condition(s) leading to these measures are not AEs, if the condition(s) was 
(were) known before the start of study treatment .  In the latter case, the condition should be 
reported as medical history.  
A suspected adverse reaction  (SAR)  is any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that 
the study treatment caused the adverse event . ‘Reasonable possibility’ means that there is 
evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the study treatment and the AE . A suspect ed 
adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality than adverse reaction, which 
means any AE caused by a study treatment.  
12.2.1.2. Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
An SAE  or reaction is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
• Results in d eath,  
• Is life -threatening,  
• Requires nonscheduled (not routine or planned) subject hospitalization for ≥ 24 hours 
or prolongation of existing hospitalization for ≥ 24 hours,  
• Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity (defined as a substa ntial 
disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions),  
• Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect, 
• Is an important medical event  defined as an event that does not fit one of the other 
outcomes but may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical 
intervention (treatment) to prevent one of the other outcomes .  Examples include 
allergic bronchospasm (a serious problem with breathing) requiring treatment in an 
YKP3089  Protocol No. YKP3089C037 
 
 66  
    
 emergency room, serious blood dyscrasias (blood disorders), or seizure/convulsion 
that does not result in hospitalization .  The development of drug dependence or drug 
abuse would be other examples of important medical events.  
Neither the condition, hospitalization, prolonged hospitalization, nor surgery are reported as an 
AE in the following circumstances: 
• Hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization for diagnostic or elective surgical procedures for a preexisting condition. Surgery should not  be reported as an outcome 
of an AE if the purpose of the surgery was elective or diagnostic and the outcome was uneventful.  
• Hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization for therapy of the target disease, unless it 
is a worsening or increase in frequency of hospital admissions as judged by the 
clinical investigator.  
• An Emergency Room visit is not considered hospitalization.  
• All AEs that do not meet any of the criteria for  seriousness should be regarded as  
non-serious AEs  
• A pre- existing condition  is one that is present at the start of the study .  A pre -
existing condition should be recorded as an AE if the frequency, intensity, or the character of the condition worsens during the study period.  
• At the end of the study, any new clinically significant findings/abnormalities that 
meet the definition of an AE must also be recorded and documented as an AE. 
Detailed information about intensity, relationship to study drug, expectedne ss, serious criteria, 
follow -up and reporting of AEs and SAEs are provided in Section 12.2. 
Special attention must be given to findings and symptoms re lated to rash and/or hypersensitivity 
that might be linked to DRESS (Drug Rash with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms) syndrome. For details, see Section 12.5.3. 
12.2.1.3. Severity Assessment  
The Investigator or the designated person will provide an assessment of the severity of each AE 
by recording a severity rating on the appropriate AE reporting page of the subject’s CRF.  In classification of AEs, the term “severe” is not the same as “serious”. Severity is a description of 
the intensity of a specific event. The term “serious” relates to a subject/event outcome or action 
criteria, usually associated with events that pose a threat to a subject’s life or f unctioning. 
All adverse events will be graded according to the severity scale below. General descriptions of each severity grade may be found in Table 10  
Table  10: General Descriptions of Severity Scale  
Severity Scale  General Descriptions  
Mild  Asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; 
intervention not indicated; The AE is easily tolerated and does not interfere with 
daily activities.  
YKP3089  Protocol No. YKP3089C037 
 
 67  
    
 Moderate  Minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; The AE interferes with 
daily activities, but the subject is still able to function.  
Severe  Not immediately life -threatening; hospitalization or prolongation of 
hospitalization indicated; disabling; The AE is incapacitating and requires 
medical intervention.  
Every effort will be made to obtain an adequate evaluation of the severity. 
12.2.1.4. Causality Assessment  
An assessment should be made of the causal relationship of the adverse event to the study 
treatment, i.e., according to the following definitions in Table 11. 
Table  11: Definitions of Causality Assessment  
Causality 
Assessment  Definitions  
Unrelated  The event is occurring before dosing  
The event is definitely produced by the subject’s clinical state or by other modes of 
therapy administered to subject  
Remote  The event does not follow a reasonable (poor) temporal relationship with drug 
treatment  
And/or the event is readily explained by t he subject’s clinical state or by other 
modes of therapy administered to subject  
Possible  Reasonable temporal relationship with drug treatment  
But the event could have been produced by the subject’s clinical state or by other 
modes of therapy administered to subject  
Probable  Reasonable temporal relationship with drug treatment, abates upon discontinuation 
of drug  
And/or event cannot be reasonably explained by the known characteristics of the subject’s clinical state.  
Definite  Distinct temporal relationsh ip with drug treatment, abates upon discontinuation of 
drug (de -challenge) and is confirmed by reappearance of the reaction on repeat 
exposure (re -challenge)  
12.3. Relationship to Study Drug  
An Investigator who is qualified in medicine must make the determination of relationship to the 
investigational product for each AE (Unrelated, Possibly Related or Probably Related).  The 
Investigator should decide whether, in his or her medical judgment, there is a reasonable 
possibility that the event may have been caused by the investigational product.  If no valid reason exists for suggesting a relationship, then the AE should be classified as “unrelated.”  If there is 
any valid reason, even if undetermined, for suspecting a possible cause -and-effect relationsh ip 
between the investigational product and the occurrence of the AE, then the AE should be 
considered “related.”  
YKP3089  Protocol No. YKP3089C037 
 
 68  
    
 If the relationship between the AE/SAE and the investigational product is determined to be 
“possible” or “probable” the event will be considere d to be related to the investigational product 
for the purposes of expedited regulatory reporting.  
12.4. Recording Adverse Events  
Adverse events spontaneously reported by the patient/subject and/or in response to an open question from the study personnel or reve aled by observation will be recorded during the study at 
the investigational site. Clinically significant changes in laboratory values, blood pressure, and 
pulse need not be reported as AEs.  However, abnormal values that constitute an SAE or lead to 
disco ntinuation of administration of study drug must be reported and recorded as an AE.  
Information about AEs and SAEs will be collected from the from first administration of study 
drug through the follow up visit. The AE term should be reported in standard me dical 
terminology when possible.  For each AE, the investigator will evaluate and report the onset (date and time), resolution (date and time), intensity, causality, action taken, serious outcome (if applicable), and whether or not it caused the patient to discontinue the study. 
It is important to distinguish between serious and severe AEs.  Severity is a measure of intensity 
whereas seriousness is defined by the criteria under  Section  12.2.  An AE of severe intensity may 
not be considered serious. 
Should a pregnancy occur in a subject or a male subject’s partner, it must be reported and 
recorded on SKLSI’s pregnancy form.  Pregnancy in itself is not rega rded as an AE unless there 
is a suspicion that an investigational product may have interfered with the effectiveness of a contraceptive medication.  
The outcome of all pregnancies (spontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, normal birth or congenital ab normality) must be followed up and documented even if the patient was 
discontinued from the study. 
All reports of congenital abnormalities/birth defects are SAEs.  Spontaneous miscarriages should 
also be reported and handled as SAEs.  Elective abortions wi thout complications should not be 
handled as AEs.  
12.5. Reporting Adverse Events  
12.5.1. Routine Reporting  
For the purposes of this study, the period of observation of adverse events for each subject extends from the signing of the informed consent form until their last  visit including the follow -
up visit or early termination, whichever is longer.   
All events reported by the subject, observed by the clinical staff (events, such as abnormal, clinically significant findings from physical examinations, ECG tracings, labora tory assessments, 
and vital sign measurements), or elicited by general questioning will be recorded in the 
Institution’s source document and reported as an adverse event and captured in the adverse 
events CRF. If necessary, every effort will be made to obt ain an adequate follow -up of the 
subjects. Should any subject choose to withdraw early from the study, they will be advised of the safety precautions to be taken.  
YKP3089  Protocol No. YKP3089C037

 Early Termination and End of Study (EOS) visit assessments should be performed, including the  
following: medical history, vital signs, physical exam, safety and clinical laboratory tests, ECG, 
and adverse event/concomitant monitoring.  
Subjects will be questioned on their health status at the beginning of each visit and before their departure from the clinical site.  Open -ended questions will be asked. 
Classification will be performed by System Organ Class (SOC) and Preferred Term (PT) using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA)  with  the version specified by 
sponsor in DMP . 
In general, AEs occurring secondary to other events (e.g., clinical sequelae or a cascade of events) should be identified by their primary cause.  For example, if severe vomiting is known to 
result in dehydration, it i s sufficient to record only vomiting as SAE or AE in the CRF.  
However, medically significant AEs occurring secondary to an initiating event that are separated 
in time should be recorded as independent events on the CRF. 
12.5.2. Serious Adverse Reporting  
The Inves tigator or any other study center personnel’s knowledge will notify any SAEs including 
fatal or life -threatening to SK Life Science, Inc. (SKLSI) and their designee IQVIA on an SAE 
report form, without regard to causality, within 24 hours after becoming aw are of its occurrence.  
If, during follow -up, any non- serious AE worsens and eventually meets the criteria for an SAE, 
that AE should be recorded as a new SAE.  
The initial SAE report must be as complete as possible, including details of the current illness 
and SAE, and an assessment of the causal relationship between the event and the investigational 
product.  Information not available at the time of the initial report (e.g., an end date for the AE, laboratory values received after the report, or hos pital discharge summary) must be documented 
and an updated SAE report form should be forwarded to the Sponsor and their designee IQVIA within 24 hours of new/updated information.  All follow -up information must be reported as 
soon as the relevant informati on is available.  The notification of all SAE’s should be directed to 
the following Sponsor representatives  (Table 12 and Table 13) .

aThe SAE report must be used for reporting  
DRESS=Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms; SAE=serious adverse event; SKLSI=SK Life Science, Inc.;  
At the time of the initial SAE report, the investigator should provide as much of the following 
information as possible:  
• Study identifier;  
YKP3089  Protocol No. YKP3089C037 
 
 71  
    
 • Study site;  
• Subject numbe r; 
• A description of the event;  
• Date of onset;  
• Current Status;  
• Whether study drug was discontinued;  
• The reason why the event is classified as serious;  
• Investigator’s assessment of the association between the event and study drug. 
Any adverse event that is c onsidered serious will be reported to the IRB by the clinical site by 
telephone and/or by email within 3 working days. Any unexpected fatal or life -threatening SAE 
will be reported to the IRB by telephone and in writing within 24 hours.  
SKLSI will be respo nsible for evaluating the events for expedited reporting, and for reporting 
them to the applicable regulatory agencies.  
If reports of any new and unexpected AEs become available to SKLSI during the clinical portion 
of this study (related or not to the pres ent study), SKLSI must advise the clinical site, through its 
Principal Investigator, of those events.  
12.5.3. Rash/Hypersensitivity/DRESS Syndrome  
Drug -induced hypersensitivity reactions with or without multi organ involvement (allergic 
reactions which may be fatal) including DRESS syndrome have been seen in patients taking cenobamate. DRESS which has occurred in <1% of clinical trial participants taking cenobamate 
stands for Drug Reaction (or Rash) with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms. This condition 
occurs usually in the first 8 weeks after initiation of treatment and rarely happens afterwards.  
Symptoms of DRESS may include:  
• Rash;  
• Fever;  
• Inflammation of internal organs;  
• Lymphadenopathy;  
• Eosinophilia;  
• Thrombocytopenia.  
In order to ensure patient safety, and allo w early identification and rapid intervention in 
suspected DRESS cases, the following measures must be followed:  
• Any patient who reports a rash or is observed to have a rash should be carefully evaluated for a drug hypersensitivity syndrome; the evaluation should include hematology and chemistry blood tests. If a subject reports a rash by telephone, an unscheduled visit should be performed promptly.  
YKP3089  Protocol No. YKP3089C037 
 
 72  
    
 • At the end of their study participation, all subjects must be informed to report any 
rash, hypersensitivity reaction or DRESS related symptoms to the investigative site as soon as they experience it. 
During Study Day 4 (prior to discharge from CRU) , subjects will be provided a safety card with 
the following hypersensitivity information and will be instructed to carry with them at all times:  
• Rash may occur and may progress to Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS). 
• Rash or other signs or symptoms of hypersensitivity (e.g., fever, lymphadenopathy, and swelling) may herald a s erious medical event and that the patient should report 
any such occurrence to the investigative site immediately.  
• Instructions on whom and where to call in the event a symptom arises and information that can be provided to an emergency room in the event t he subject 
cannot reach the investigator site.  
• Reminder to check skin daily for evidence of rash for the first four months of therapy  
At the end of their study participation, all subjects must be informed to report any rash, 
hypersensitivity reaction or DR ESS related symptoms to the investigative site as soon as they 
experience it.  
In addition, please remind all patients to call your office immediately if they experience any of 
the following symptoms:  
• Rash;  
• Fever;  
• Swollen lymph nodes in your neck;  
• Abdominal  or chest pain;  
• Puffy face or ankles;  
• Yellowing of skin or eyes. 
Investigators will be instructed to identify local specialists in dermatology, cardiology, nephrology and hepatology who can be call upon onto immediately to see the patient and manage their condition if  DRESS syndrome is suspected.  
The SK Life Science, Inc . (SKLSI) and their designee (see SAE Contact Information in 
Section  12.5.2)  must be  notified immediately of any suspected cases of DRESS syndrome as an 
SAE.

 13. STATISTICS  
13.1. Statistical and Analytical Plans  
This section presents a summary of the planned clinical pharmacology and safety analyses for 
this study.  
Safety statistical analysis deta ils will be provided in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) for this 
study. Clinical pharmacology analysis details (including the definition of the PK population) will be provided in the Clinical Pharmacology Data Analysis Plan (CPAP).  
The Biostatistics De partment of the CRO or SKLSI will generate the SAP. The SKLSI Clinical 
Pharmacology Department will generate the CPAP. Both the SAP and CPAP will be finalized prior to clinical database lock. Final analyses will take place after all subjects have completed  the 
study and all data have been entered in the clinical study database.  
Any deviation from the SAP and/or CPAP will be reported in the section “Changes in Planned Analysis” in the Clinical Study Report (CSR).  
Statistical analyses will be performed using appropriate statistical software, such as SAS (Version 9.4 or above). PK parameters will be calculated using Phoenix WinNonlin (Version 8.1 or above).  
13.1.1. Sample Size and Power 
The number of subjects to be enrolled was chosen based on practical considerations and is considered sufficient for the study objectives. No formal sample size calculation was performed.  
13.1.2. Analysis Populations  
• Safety Population : All subjects who have received one dose of cenobamate   
• PK Population : All subjects who have received one dose of cenobamate and have 
sufficient quantifiable PK samples to calculate primary PK parameters appropriately. The final decision to include subjects in the PK population set took into consideration 
possible AEs affec ting the disposition of cenobamate (e.g., vomiting or diarrhea). 
Reasons supporting each decision will be clearly stated in the clinical study report. A 
sensitivity analysis may be performed if deemed necessary to support a subject’s exclusion or inclusion. 
13.1.3. Pharmacokinetic Analysis  
This section will be further detailed in the CPAP.  
13.1.3.1. Pharmacokinetic Parameters  
The PK parameters that will be derived from the cenobamate concentration versus time profiles, where data permit, are listed in  Table 16.  
The plasma PK parameters will be estimated using a non -compartmental approach. A linear -up, 
log-down approach will be used to estimate the area under the plasma concentration versus time 
curve, and the terminal half -life will be estimated where appropriate.  
YKP3089  Protocol No. YKP3089C037

Other PK parameters will be determined if deemed appropriate. Details of the PK analysis will 
be provided in the CPAP. 
13.1.3.2. Formulation and Food Effect Analysis  
An analysis of variance (ANOVA) will be used to compare suspension vs. tablet formulations 
and suspension under fed vs. suspension under fasted conditions. PK parameter (C max, AUC last, 
and  AUC ∞) values will be log -transformed for all subjects included in the PK population set and 
the ratio and corresponding 90% CIs for the ratio of the test (suspension or fed) vs . reference 
(tablet or fasted) will be compared. An absence of effect will be concluded if the 90% CIs lie 
within the 80% -  125% predefined boundaries.  
13.1.3.3. Analysis on T max 
For each subject, the Wilcoxon signed- rank test will be used to test for differences in  tmax. 
13.1.3.4. Summary and Presentation of PK Data and Parameters in the CSR  
Individual and mean plasma concentrations at each sampling time point for cenobamate will be presented in listings and tables with descriptive summary statistics including mean, geometric  
mean, range, standard deviation (SD) and coefficient of variation (CV). Individual, mean and/or 
median concentrations per treatment group will be plotted versus time on semi -logarithmic 
scales.  
Summary statistics of PK parameters including mean, geometric mean, median, range, SD and 
CV will be presented by treatment group.

examination findings, and any other parameter that are relevant for safety assessment. Full 
details of the safety analysis to be performed will be included in the SAP. 
13.2.3. Adverse Events  
Adverse events will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
(MedDRA). MedDRA terms will be used to summarize AEs by system organ class (SOC) and preferred term (PT).  
Treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs) are defined as adverse events that were started or 
worsened on or after the date of the first dose of study medication (Day 1) to the follow -up visit 
(Day 69).  
A listing of all individual AEs will be provided. Summary tables of TEAEs will be presented by SOC and PT, including a table containing the number of subjects experiencing AEs by treatment 
group, and a table containing the number of subjects experiencing SAEs by treatment group (if 
applicable). Details of the  AE summary analyses  will be described in Statistical Analysis Plan 
(SAP).  
13.2.4. Clinical Laboratory Assessment s 
All lab data will be displayed as International System of units (SI) and may be converted into 
other systems (e.g., United States customary system [USCS or USC]) for reporting and 
processing purposes, as appropriate.  
Clinical laboratory data will be listed and accompanied by an indication flag if the parameter is 
outside the reference range and a summary listing of all data assessed by the Investigator as 
clinically significant will be prepared. Clinical laboratory data will also be summarized descriptive ly.

to comply with Good Clinical Practice (GCP ) guidel ines. On- site checking of the  eCRFs for 
completeness and clarity, cross -checking with source documents, and clarification of 
administrative matters will be performed.  
The study will be monitored by SKLSI or its designee. Monitoring will be done by personal 
visits from a representative  of the Sponsor  (site monitor) who will review the eCRFs and source 
documents. The site monitor will ensure that the investigation is conducted according to protocol 
design and regulatory requirements. 
14.2. Audits and Inspections  
Authorized representatives of S KLSI, a regulatory authority, an Independent Ethics Committee 
or an Institutional Review Board may visit the site to perform audits or inspections, including source data verification.  The purpose of an SKLSI audit or inspection is to systematically and 
independently examine all study- related activities and documents to determine whether these 
activities were conducted, and data were recorded, analyzed, and accurately reported according 
to the protocol, Good Clinical Practice guidelines of the International  Conference on 
Harmonization, and any applicable regulatory requirements.  The investigator should contact SKLSI immediately if contacted by a regulatory agency about an inspection. 
14.2.1. Electronic Data Capture (EDC)  
SKLSI or designee will ensure secure access to and training on the EDC application, sufficient to 
permit site personnel to enter or correct information in the eCRFs for the subjects for which they 
are responsible.  
The eCRFs will be completed for each study subject. It is the Investigator’s responsi bility to 
ensure the accuracy, completeness, clarity, and timeliness of the data reported in the subject’s eCRF. Source documentation supporting the eCRF data should indicate the subject’s participation in the study and should document the dates and detail s of study procedures, adverse 
events, other observations, and subject status. 
The Investigator, or designated representative, should complete the eCRF as soon as possible 
after information is collected. An explanation should be provided for all missing da ta. 
The audit trail entry will show the user’s identification information, and the date and time of the correction. Investigators must provide through the EDC application formal approval of all the information in the eCRFs and changes to the eCRFs to endor se the final submitted data for the 
subjects for which they are responsible.  
SKLSI or designee will retain the eCRF data and corresponding audit trails. A copy of the final archival eCRF in the form of a CD or other electronic media will be placed in the Investigator’s study file.

 17. DATA HANDLING AND RECORDKEEPING  
17.1. Inspection of Records  
SKLSI will be allowed to conduct site visits to the investigation facilities for the purpose of 
monitoring any aspect of the study.  The Investigator agrees to allow the monitor to inspe ct the 
drug storage area, study drug stocks, drug accountability records, subject charts and study source documents, and other records relative to study conduct. 
17.2. Retention of Records  
The Investigator will maintain all study records according to ICH -GCP and /or applicable local 
regulatory require ment(s), whichever is longest. If the I nvestigator withdraws from the 
responsibility of keeping the study records, custody must be transferred to a person willing to accept the responsibility and SKLSI  must be notifie d.  
17.2.1. Screening  
After signing of the ICF/assent form, each subject will be assigned an 8- digit subject 
identification number (i.e. 01001001). The first two digits is for country, the next 3 digits is for site, and the last 3 digits is for subject.  
The subje cts who screen -fail will be allowed to re -screen only once. The re -screened subject will 
be assigned a new subject ID, and the 2 subject IDs  will be linked in the clinical database.  
17.2.2. Data Quality Assurance  
The following data quality steps will be implemente d: 
• All relevant subject data relating to the study will be recorded on eCRFs unless directly transmitted to the sponsor or designee electronically (e.g., laboratory data).  
• The investigator is responsible for verifying that data entries are accurate and cor rect 
by electronically signing the eCRF.  
• The investigator must maintain accurate documentation (source data) that supports 
the information entered in the eCRF.  
• The investigator must permit study -related monitoring, audits, EC review, and 
regulatory agency inspections and provide direct access to source data documents. 
• The sponsor or designee is responsible for the data management of this study 
including quality checking of the data. Predefined agreed risks, monitoring thresholds, quality tolerance thresholds, controls, and mitigation plans will be 
documented in a risk management register. Additional details of quality checking to 
be performed on the data may be included in a Data Management Plan.  
• A study monitor will perform ongoing source data verification to confirm that data entered into the eCRF by authorized site personnel are accurate, complete, and 
verifiable from source documents; that the safety and rights of subjects are being 
protected; and that the study is being conducted in accordance with the c urrently 
YKP3089  Protocol No. YKP3089C037 
 
 83  
    
 approved protocol and any other study agreements, ICH -GCP, and all applicable 
regulatory requirements.  
Records and documents, including signed ICFs, pertaining to the conduct of this study must be 
retained by the investigator in accordance with local regulations or institutional policies. No 
records may be destroyed during the retention period without the written approval of the sponsor. 
No records may be transferred to another location or party without written notification to the sponsor. 
17.2.3. Investig ator Documentation Responsibilities  
• All individual, subject -specific study data will also be entered into a 21 Code of 
Federal  Regulations Part 11- compliant electronic data capture (EDC) system on an 
eCRF in a timely fashion.  
• All data generated from external sources (e .g., laboratory and bioanalytical data), and 
transmitted to the sponsor or designee electronically, will be integrated with the 
subject’s  eCRF data in accordance with the Data Management Plan.  
• An eCRF must be completed for each enrolled subject who undergoes any screening 
procedures, according to the eCRF completion instructions. The sponsor, or CRO, 
will review the supporting source documentation against the data entered into the eCRFs to verify the accuracy of the electronic data. The i nvestigator will ensure that 
corrections are made to the eCRFs and that data queries are resolved in a timely 
fashion by the study staff. 
• Terms will be coded in accordance with MedDRA and WHO Drug dictionary versions specified in Data Management Plan.  
• The investigator will sign and date the eCRF via the EDC system’s electronic signature  procedure. These signatures will indicate that the investigator reviewed and 
approved the data on the eCRF, data queries, and site notifications.

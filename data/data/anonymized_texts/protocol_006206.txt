Assessment : A single pla sma sample will be collected prior to topical application of IP at the

Genomic 
Testing (Optional): A separate blood specimen will be collected at the Bas eline Visit for genomic 
testing. This specimen may be used to study genetic and genomic mechanisms involved in Gorlin Syndrome pathogenesis, disease progression, and outcome. This sample should be collected at the Baseline Visit prior to dosing, but may be collected at any time during the study, if necessary. Genomic testing will not be 
available to study participants in Denmark due to country -specific regulations.  
Statistical 
Methods : Determination of Sample Size  
The sample size in this study was determi ned based on number of nSEBs as the 
original primary endpoint. In the UK Phase 2 study, the mean number of new BCC lesions at 6 months was 0.42 in the Patidegib  Topical Gel, 2%, group with 
a standard deviation (SD) of , and a mean of  in the Vehicle group with a SD of . The effect size was 0.81. It is assumed that at 6 months, the mean number of nSEBs in the Patidegib Topical Gel, 2%, group will be , with a SD of 0.94, while at 6 months the mean and SD in the Vehicle group will be the same as in the Phase 2 study at 6 months (see Table  4) for an e ffect size of . 
At 12 months, it is assumed that the means and SDs will be twice those observed at 6 months. With these assumptions, 63 subjects in the Pat idegib 
Topical Gel, 2%, group and 63 in the Vehicle group (for a total of 126 subjects) will give  >90% power for a two- sided 0.05 level statistical significance. To 
account for a 16% drop-out rate, approximately   subjects will be 
randomized. Sample size  was calculated based on a Wilcoxon -Mann -Whitney 
test, which is conservative if the underlying di stribution is Negative Binomial.  
Given the change in primary endpoint requested by the FDA, it is acknowledged that the power for statistical significance in new BCCs may be different than what was projected before the initiation of the study, and based on nSEBs. We can however state that i f the drug effect on new BCCs is the same proportion to 
its vehicle mean as is  the drug effect on nSEBs to its vehicle mean , and if the 
coefficient of variations of new BCCs and nSEBs are similar, then the new BCC 
primary endpoint will have the same power as does nSEBs. 
 
Statistical Analysis  
The primary population for efficacy analyses will be the Intent- to-Treat (ITT) 
populat ion, with the per -protocol (PP) population for supportive ana lyses. The

12 months. This endpoint will be analyzed using a negative binomial regression 
to compare treatment grou ps with  number of BCCs at Baseline, Age  
years), gender, prior HHI therapy, and geographic region as covariates. 
Secondary endpoints that are based on number of new BCCs  or nSEBs will be 
analyzed similar  to the primary endpoint . This includes the  proportion of 
subjects with at least two  new facial BCCs and the proportion of subjects with at 
least one new facial BCC.  
The primary method of dealing with missing data will be the multiple imputation method. Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF) and observed case analyses will be done as sensitivity analyses.  
 
Safety endpoints will be summarized with means and standard errors, or 
proportions.

PROPRIETARY AND CONFIDENTIAL   Page 15 of 73 4 INTRODUCTION  
Basal cell carcinomas (BCC) are slow growing tumors of the skin. They c an be sporadic or 
inherited. B asal cell nevus (Gorlin) syndrome ( ]1) (BCNS)  is a rare autosomal 
dominant heritable  disease characterized by numerous phenotypic abnormalities, most prominent 
among which is the de velopment of numerous BCCs over a l ifetime. Reports of its prevalence 
vary; the highest estimate is . The burden of BCCs varies among Gorlin Syndrome 
patients. In general, Gorlin Syndrome patients have their BCCs treated as they become 
problematic (i.e., at risk of invasion of vital structures such as eyes, nose, or ears ), large enough 
that scarring will be particularly noticeable if treatment is delayed,  or larg e enough off the face 
such that they are uncomfortable, bleed).  
Several topically -applied drugs (e.g., imiquimod and 5 -fluoruracil) are used in the treatment of 
sporadic BCCs. Both of these can cure approximately  of the superficial subtype of BCCs, 
which generally occur off the face. However, they generally are not useful for nodular BCCs, 
which are the more prevalent subtype, especially on the face. Surgery  is the definitive treatment 
of choice for BCC which are refractory to other interventions.  
Prevention of BCCs so far has been limited to admonitions to avoid sunlight, advice which i s 
followed infrequently by patients at risk of developing sporadic skin tumors, and which has not 
been shown to produce a statistically significant reduction in BCC inc idence.  
In 1996, two groups identified the PTCH1 gene as the locus of the mutations that cause Gorlin 
Syndrome.2-4 Patients with Gorlin Syndrome have one defective heritable copy of this gene, and 
sporadic loss of the second allele is crucial to the develo pment of all of their BCCs . The PTCH1 
gene encodes the primary inhibitor of the hedgehog (HH) signaling pathway, and its function is to inhibit signaling by the next “downstream” member of the HH pathway –  
(SMO).  All Gorlin Syndrome BCCs , unlike sporadic BCCs, thus far analyzed  have loss of 
PTCH1 with out activating mutations of SMO.
5 This signaling pathway is crucial to development 
of many organs during embryogenesis but in adult life functions in only a limited number of sites, among which  is the hair follicle. The importance of aberrant HH signaling as the driver of 
BCCs was proved indisputably by the strong anti- tumor effect of small molecules that down -
regulate this pathway.  
Following identification of uncontrolle d HH signaling as the driving molecular abnormality in all 
BCCs, several anti -HH drugs have been developed for oral treatment of BCCs. T wo of these – 
vismodegib and sonidegib – have been approved for systemic treatment of advanced BCCs. The 
latter are defined as BCCs whose surgical excision likely would produc e unsatisfactory results 
(i.e., “locally advanced”) or those which have become metastatic
6. Approximately 50% of such 
BCCs fail to respond initially, frequently due to mutations in the SMOOTHENED gene, which encodes the pr otein to which these drugs bind. Of those that do respond, a significant proportion

PROPRIETARY AND CONFIDENTIAL   Page 16 of 73 develop secondary resistance, often due to mutations in the drug binding pocket of the SMO 
protein .7  
Vismodegib also has been studied for efficacy vs. BCCs in patients with Gorlin Syndrome.8 
Unlike results in advanced BCCs, essentially all Gorlin Syndrome non-advanced tumors respond 
by shrinking and eventually most disappear completely , both clinically and histologically. The 
BCCs in Gorlin Syndrome  patients fail to develop resistance and, so long as Gorlin Syndrome  
patients continue to take the drug, no nSEB s develop. The combined result of shrinkage of 
existing BCCs and blockage of the development of nSEBs  is that these patients have no need for 
surgical treatment of BCCs so long as they continue to ingest vismodegib. But because of detrimental class -specific side effects, most patients discontinue vismodegib, and most/ all of the 
clinically and histologically c leared BCCs recur to the same size as before treatment .
8 Adverse 
events (AEs)  seen with systemic hedgehog inhibitor ( HHI) include muscle spasms, alopecia, 
dysgeusia, nausea, fatigue, weight loss, diarrhoea and decreased appet ite [Vismodegib and 
Sonidegib USPI].  
Patidegib is a semi -synthetic small molecule which when given orally has good therapeutic 
efficacy  for advanced BCCs but produces the same types of AEs as do other systemic HH 
inhibitors.  
PellePharm is developing Patidegib Topical Gel, 2%, for the reduction of BCC burden in 
subjects with Gorlin Syndrome. Patidegib Topical Gel, 2%, is manufactured with excipients 
gene rally accepted as safe, is  stable in the developed gel formulation, and can be applied to mini-
pig skin without irritation.  Application of Patidegib Topical Gel, 2%, significantly reduces 
murine BCC tumor size in vivo and reduces GLI1 biomarker expression in vitro in human BCC 
tumor explants. 
Patidegib gel has been evaluated in 1 phase 1 and 2 phase 2 studie s (UK proof -of-concept study 
in patients with Gorlin syndrome; and US dose escalating study  for sporadic BCCs).

development program, including

The goal of the US dose- escalating trial (Pelle -926-202) was to evaluate patidegib topical gel’s

PROPRIETARY AND CONFIDENTIAL   Page 19 of 73 6 OVERALL STUDY DESIGN AND PLAN  
This is a global, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, stratified, ve hicle -controlled study of the 
efficacy and safety of Patidegib Topical Gel, 2%, applied topically twice daily to the face of 
adult subjects with Gorlin Syndrome . Subjects will be required to apply the IP for 12 months. 
The prima ry endpoint is a comparison between the two treatment arms of the number of new 
BCCs that develop over the 12 month period. BCCs will be imaged and tracked consistently throughout the study in order to identify new BCCs and nSEBs.  
An open- label extension s afety and tolerability study  is planned for at least 12 months duration 
following the end of this study. All subjects who complete the Month 12/Exit Visit having demonstrated adequate compliance with application of the IP without major Protocol Deviations (PDs) during the study will be eligible for participation in the extension study.  
The principal investigator (PI) or designee will be responsib le for the oversight of the study at 
their clinical trial site.   
6.1 Rationale for S tudy D esign  
The key el ements of the study design are choice of the primary endpoint, stratification, eligibility 
criteria , disease severity , a relatively longer treatment duration (12 months ) than that in the 
Phase 2 Gorlin Syndrome study (treatment duration 6 months), the methodology for 
measurement of BCCs, and the use of imaging to track BCCs .  
 Choice of Primary E ndpoint  
The primary endpoint of the study is a comparison between treatment arms of  the number of new 
BCCs  per subject that develop over the 12 month period. BCC s urgery has signi ficant morbidity 
(e.g., scarring, functional loss of eyelid, nose, ear) and most BCCs in patients with Gorlin 
syndrome are ultimately removed by surgery.  Reduction in the number of facial BCCs and in the number of resulting BCC surgeries are serious u nmet medical needs and the number of BCCs 
and number of nSEBs are therefore cons idered appropriate correlating study endpoints.  
Generally , a facial BCC of longest diameter  is considered a SEB .8 In this study , a BCC is  
considered a nSEB if the diagnosis was verified histologically, it was not a SEB at B aseline, and 
post B aseline the BCC was  either surgically removed because of the developm ent of possible 
functional facial/health impairment, as determined by the Investigator or met object ive size 
criteria (irrespective of whether or not it was surgically removed). These obj ective criteria are 
that post B aseline, the BCC has a longest diamete r  mm in longest 
diameter from Baseline.  
 Stratification  Parameters 
The study design incorporates stratification to ensure that potential Baseline confounders of 
efficacy are distributed evenly across treatment arms. The assignment of subjects into the study is being stratified based on Gender, Age and previous HHI therapy.

Phase 3 Efficacy and Safety for Reduction of Disease Burden of Basal Cell Carcinomas  
 
Pelle -926-301 , Protocol Amendment 3, 04JAN2021 
PROPRIETARY AND CONFIDENTIAL   Page 20 of 73 Gender is a potential confounder as female subjects had more tumor response compared with 
male subjects in the prior Pelle -926-202 Phase 2 study. However, both fe males and male subjects 
treated with active treatment had fewer nSEBs compared with subjects treated with vehicle. 
Female subjects may have higher topical compli ance as seen in other topical trials.9 Gender will 
be used as a stratification factor in this Phase 3 trial.  
Previous HHI therapy might also confound the assessment of efficacy. I n the trial of oral 
vismodegib for subject s with Gorlin Syndrome , the rate of  development of nSEBs was lower 
after vismodegib was discontin ued ( ) than it had been during placebo 
treatment prior to vismodegib treatment ( ).8 It is also likely that it is the 
subject s with more severe disease that ar e prescribed oral HH Is. For the se reasons, previous HHI 
therapy is a stratification parameter.  
Advanced age has been found to correlate with higher numbers of BCCs and new tumors in 
Gorlin Syndrome subject s from a natural history study .10 Age is therefore a stratification factor 
to avoid confounding age- related rates of Baseline tumor progression across treatment groups.  
 Treatment Duration 
The duration of treatment in the phase 2 UK study in Gorlin Syndrome patients (Pelle -926-201) 
was 6 months. A 12 -mon th study increases the likelihood for the occurrence of new BCCs and 
nSEBs when compared to a 6-month study. This is also appropriate given that BCC are innately slowly developing tumor s. A 12 -month safety database will also further inform the overall 
bene fit-risk of patidegib topical gel as a chronic therapy in Gorlin Syndrome. 
 BCC T racking  
The study design ensures that BCCs are tracked consistently throughout the study. The 
12 months treatment duration necessitates the  diligent tracking and photography of BCC s to 
assist the PI with tumor identification and measurement recall . This is accomplished by capturing 
standardized unmarked digital images of the face at every visit  (unmarked). M arked (annotated) 
images will also b e collected in addition to unmarked images at prespecified visits (see Table  1). 
Pelle -926-201 also included imaging to track BCCs.   
At visits prior to IP application (i.e., Screening and Baseline), a second set of digital images 
(annotated images) w ill be captured, after the BCCs on the face have been identified, labeled, 
and numbered for tracking purposes. I t is possible that in some instances at Screening and/or 
Baseline all BCCs cannot be tracked (labeled and numbered ) due to limited space for stickering 
on the face. In such situations, the BCCs will be tracked in order of decreasing (longest) BCC diameter. It is of critical importance that all SEBs are identified in the images.   
At prespecified post-B aseline visits, the PI will track and measure B CCs for a second set of 
(marked) images. For a given subject, each BCC will be given the same tracking number as

Pelle -926-301 , Protocol Amendment 3, 04JAN2021 
PROPRIETARY AND CONFIDENTIAL   Page 21 of 73 assigned prior to IP application , and all new tumors identified will be given  new sequential 
numbers.  
 BCC M easurement  
The primary endpoint re quires that all Baseline BCCs be eliminated from consideration  as new 
BCCs, and that all BCCs are identified and  tracked for growth into nSEBs or for possible clinical 
resolution . At Baseline for all BCCs that have been tracked , the longest diameter will t hen be 
measured by the Investigator using a standardized method. SEBs identified at B aseline will not 
qualify to be called nSEBs.  
At prespecified post-B aseline visits, the Investigator will identify (label and number) all BCCs 
that were tracked prior to IP application start and will identify any new BCCs that have appeared 
since start of IP application . At these pre-specified post-B aseline visits , the Investigator will 
review the BCCs and identify BCCs that may be approximately ) in 
size. The Investigator will measure the longest diameter for these BCCs, identify them as new or 
previously existing SEBs, and flag them on the label. Throughout the study for any given subject  
each BCC will have the same number .  
Qualified, trained, and blinded Image Data Quality  Reviewer  (s) will examine each set of subject 
images (1) to determine t he accuracy of mapping annotations, and (2) to rule out wild 
transcription  or transposition reporting errors in  BCC diameter . The I mage Data Quality  
Reviewer  (s) may query the Investigator, as appropriate. The Investigator may review the query 
and correct , as appropriate. The Investigator’s decision of the BCC diameter and surgical 
eligibility is final.  
 Eligibility Criteria and Disea se Severity   
Patidegib topical gel is being evaluated in subject s with Gorlin Syndrome . Gorlin Syndrome is 
typically diagnosed clinically, based on the major and minor diagnostic criteria which are 
reflected in the inclusion criteria6.  
The protocol requires that the subject must have had at least 10 ( with at least 3 on the face) 
clinically typical BCCs present within 24  months prior to Randomization (Baseline/Day  1). This 
is to ensure that subject s with moderate to severe Gorlin Syndrome who are most likely to 
benefit from treatment are enrolled.  
Additionally the subject must have at least 2 BCCs with longest diameter <5 mm present on the 
face prior to Randomization (Baseline/Day  1). This increases the possibility for developing a 
nSEB during the study.  
6.2 Dose R ationale 
The PK data from the UK Phase 2 Proof- of-Concept (Pelle -926-201) study showed 1/6 subjects 
on Patidegib Topical Gel, 4% had a detectable patidegib concentration in plasma at Week 14 
( ) and 1/6 subj ects had a detectable concentration at Week 26 ( ). No

the subject at significant risk , could confound the study results, or could interfere 
significantly with the subject’s participation in the study. This may include a history of other skin conditions (e. g., severe facial eczema) or diseases, metabolic dysfunction, 
physical examination (P E) findings, or clinical laboratory findings giving reasonable 
suspicion of a disease or condition that contraindicates use of an investigational drug or that might affect interpretation of the results of the study or render the subject at high risk 
from treatment complications.  
 
7.2 Concomitant M edications and T reatments  
All medications listed as ex clusion criteria cannot be taken concomitantly during the study.  
During the study, subjects will be allowed to use moisturizers and emollients and will be 
encouraged to use sunscreen of at least 30 SPF at least once daily on all exposed skin sites. Subject s must wait 30  minutes after IP application before applying any moisturizer, emollient, or 
sunscreen.  
Facial BCCs may be removed at the discretion of the Investig ator by the Investigator or a 
competent physician/surgeon at any time after the Baseline Visi t if the Investigator believes that 
continued growth of the BCC might have deleterious effects on the health of the subject. Non-facial BCCs may be removed at the discretion of the Investigator or PSCP.  
7.3 Study Drug Discontinuation  
The Investigator has the right to permanently discontinue IP application  of a subject at any time 
if in their opinion the continuation of the IP is deleterious to the subject’ s health or 
discontinuation is in the subject’ s best interest. If the subject becomes pregnant,  IP will be 
discontinued immediately.  
If, for any reason, a subject is discontinued during the treatment period prior to Month 12/ Exit 
Visit, evaluations should be performed at the time of early termination and the reason for 
termination will be recorded in the end of study source documentation. A t the 30 day follow up 
additional information may be collected. All data gathered on the subject will be made available 
to PellePha rm.  
7.4 Subject Withdrawal Criteria  
The Investigator may consider discontinuing a subj ect with a major protocol violation or 
deviation (e.g., failure to meet study enrollment c riteria, use of disallowed medications). 
However, an excessive rate of discontinuation can render the study uninterpretable; therefore, unnecessary discontinuation of subjects should be avoided. A protocol violation or deviation does not in itself necessarily constitute grounds for removal of the subject from the trial if the subject’s safety is not compromised.

PROPRIETARY AND CONFIDENTIAL   Page 27 of 73 8 STUDY PROCEDURES AND ASSESSMENTS  
The study will be conducted as outlined in the schedule of as sessments ( SoA) ( Table  1). All 
study visits will take place in person at the study site/clinic, except for the 30 -day safety follow-
up visit, which will be by phone call. All subject infor mation a nd data obtained during the study 
visits will be recorded in the source documents, applicable study logs, and electronic case report 
forms  (eCRFs ), as appropriate. 
Investigators (and any designee) must have appropriate, documented experience and training, or 
obtain approval from PellePharm based on experience (or through additional training organized and provided by PellePharm [or designee]). Sites will undergo a feasibility assessment, and a formal Pre -Trial Visit (PTV) conducted by the study Clini cal Research Organization ( CRO) (or 
designee). Sites that meet the requirements to conduct a study according to Good Clinical Practice ( GCP ) and applicable local and country regulatory requirements, as well as Investigator 
and site personnel with demonstrated experience and qualifications will be approved by PellePharm or designee to conduct the study. The CRO will continue the site activation process 
to assist sites to receive IRB approval and IP shipment and conduct of a Trial Initiation Visit 
(TIV) prior to the enrollment of subjects into the study for each site. In addition, at least one and 
preferably two site personnel will be trained in the image capture method by the imaging vendor 
as part of the site activation process. A  back -up image capture site staff member should be 
available as needed.  
At each study visit, every attempt should be made to ensure that the same Investigator assesses 
the same subject. PellePharm realizes that the conduct of a clinical trial involves a t eam of study 
staff who perfo rm a variety of functions under the supervision of the PI. Tasks and 
responsibilities are delegated by the PI, and the PI is responsible for the conduct of the study at their site as well the training and oversite of all site pe rsonnel and other related non- site 
personnel. There are specific tasks that PellePharm requires be done by a licensed physician with appropriate experience. As outlined below and in the SoA ( Table  1), these tasks include SEB 
biopsy procedure, assessment and reporting, BCC measurement and assessment, and recording application site reactions.  The surgical excision of the BCC may be done by the Investigator or 
may be referred to a licensed physician with appropriate experience.  
PellePharm also realizes that scheduling visits can be challenging and has allowed for flexibility 
with study visit days . It should be noted that the indicated visit day is in reference to the Baseline 
Visit. For example , the Month 8 visit is intended to be 8 months after the Baseline Visit.  A 
month will be considered to have approximately 30 days. 8.1 Study Procedures  
The SoA is provided in Table  1. Subject s should be seen for all visits on the designated day or as 
close as practicall y possible. The Baseline Visit may take place no more than 45 days after the 
Screening visit. If this period exceeds 45 days, subjects will need to be re- screened.

PROPRIETARY AND CONFIDENTIAL   Page 28 of 73 The assessments/procedures to be performed at the different visits are elaborated here.  
 Informed C onsent  
All subjects must provide written informed consent before any study related procedures are 
performed. Each subject will receive a copy of the signed consent form.  Subjects may be pre-
screened (chart review , etc.) for eligibility prior to any  study related proc edure.  
 Inclusion and Exclusion 
Following provision of informed consent from each subject, the Investigator will determine whether subjects meet the inclusion/e xclusion criteria .  
A WOCBP is defined as a woman who (a) has not undergone hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy or (b) has not been naturally post-menopausal for at least 24 consecutive months (i.e., has had no menses in the 24 preceding months).  
A WOCBP may be enrolled if she agrees to complete abstinence from sexual intercour se or the 
couple agrees to use at least 2 forms of birth control as defined by the use of a condom with 
spermicide in association with one of the following: bilateral tubal ligation, combined oral contraceptives (estrogens and progesterone), or implanted or injectable contra ceptives with a 
stable dose for at least 1 month prior to the Baseline Visit, or hormonal intra -uterine device 
(IUD) inserted at least 1 month prior to the Baseline Visit.  
 Randomization  
Details on randomization are available in  Section s 9.1 and 9.2. 
 Demographics 
Subject's date/year  of birth, gender at birth , race and ethnicity will be recorded in the eCRF , 
where allowed by local regulatory authoriti es. Race and ethnicity will not be col lected in 
countries where prohibited. 
 Medical History  
Subjects’ relevant family history of Gorlin Syndrome and medical history pertinent to eligibility criteria will be collected . Information about medical conditions that resolved 2 or more years 
prior to Screening do not need to be recorded unless considered relevant by the Investigator. 
 Prior and C oncomitant Medications 
Prior and concomitant m edications will be captured separately for BCC  (facial) and other 
indication s.  
All medications ongoing in the 12 months prior to Baseline or ongoing at any time during the study will be recorded in the eCRF. The start date for all medications that were started during the study period must be reported. Lik ewise, the end date for all m edications that were discontinued 
during the study period must be captured.

 IP A pplication  
For the first application, the subject will apply the IP at the study site under the direction of the 
Study Coordinator (or designee). The IP should be applied after all clinical assessments. Additional information on IP application is available in  Section 10.4.  
 Compliance  
The site pharmacist (or designated site personnel) will collect and weigh the previously dispensed IP tubes to assess compliance with IP dosing for the preceding month. The weight of the IP tubes will be recorded on the appropriate eCRF. See Section 9.4 and the Pharmacy Manual for full details on assessi ng compliance. 
 Unscheduled V isit  
Subjects may return to the site for unscheduled visits in the event of an AE, SAE or as deemed necessary by the Investigator. The same procedures as described in the post- Baseline Visits may 
be conducted. For other subject care management, the Investigator may refer the subject to their primary care physician and/or th eir PSCP. Data collected will be  reported in the ‘Unscheduled 
Visit’ eCRF page.  
8.2 Efficacy Assessments  
 BCC Imaging 
Digital imaging of the BCCs will be taken us ing a . Subjects with facial hair 
should be encouraged to remove or at least to clip short any facial hair so that any BCCs present within the facial hair region will be easily identifiable on the captured images. Subjects must remove ma ke-up prior to the facial exam. Photos will be taken to assess 5 views of the face in the 
same plane of an arc at a fixed distance from the face ( ). The 
unmarked and marked digital facial images will uploaded to the imaging vendor portal for 
further review.  Full details for image capture can be found in the Imag e Review Work 
Instruction . 
8.2.1.1 BCC Imaging (Unmarked)  
Take photos of the subject’s unmarked face using the camera as described above for unmarked imaging.  
8.2.1.2 BCC Imaging M arked ( Annotated)  
Following image ca pture of the subject’s unmarked face, repeat the process and annotate the 
image by:  
a. Identify ing all BCCs, dot around border and place a sticker (1, 2, etc.). Record the 
measurement of the longest diameter of each BCC.  BCCs in the region of the 
eyelids or posterior to the tragus are not numbered and tracked. 
b. Mark ing each SEB (   ) with a red dot on the sticker 
to indicate the BCC as a SEB  or nSEB.

 Biopsy  
All biopsies are to be done at the cli nical trial site. Prior to the biopsy, the image data quality  
reviewer will confirm that the BCC has been tracked consistently th roughout the study. 
However, if the surgeon or Investigator feels that continued growth of a nSEB can pose a 
significant proble m, then it can be b iopsied and removed at any time. The biopsy will be 
reviewed and reported by a licensed physician with appropri ate experience . The biopsy diagnosis 
will be captured in the eCRF.  The detailed report of the biopsy will be part of the sourc e 
document. Additionally  biopsy slides and photomicrographs will be retained at the site. The 
biopsy report, slides and photomicrographs must b e made available for the study monitor or an 
audit by the Sponsor and/or Regulator.   
If the Investigator feels t hat continued growth of a nSEB can pose a significant problem, then a 
biopsy can be done at anytime, followed by surgery as required .

The safety assessments in the study include vital signs, AEs, dermal safety , and laboratory 
assessments (Section 11.1).  
 Dermal Safety and T olerability  Events  
Safety and tolerability will be evaluated through assessment of selected local signs and 
symptoms (pain/burning, pruritus, erythema, edema, and crusting) on the face. Any local skin 
reaction that requires use of a concomitant therapy  or causes interruption or discontinuation 
of the IP should be reported as a dermal safety event . These events will be assessed for 
severity, relative to the skin reactions scale ( Table  2).

 Physical E xamination and Vital Signs  
Physical examinations (PEs) including v ital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, respiration rate, 
and temperature) will be collected and reported. He ight will be collected at the Baseline Visit 
only. C linically significant changes from B aseline will be captured as AEs. Changes in BCC  
measurements and BCC count will be captured separately as efficacy (imaging and tracking) 
assessments and not as a PE as sessment. Changes in BCC count or size will not constit ute 
AEs.  
PEs are also done at quarterly visits. Additional PEs at other visits  may be collected 
according to any signs/symptoms and/or positive findings at previous PE.  
 Laboratory A ssessments  
Routine safety laboratory tests (complete blood count/differential, urinalysis, and serum chemistry) will be performed as per the SoA (Table  1) and Appendix 17.1. Any out-of- range 
laboratory result that is considered clinically significant by the Investigator will be recorded as an AE and should be confirmed by repeat testing at the discretion of the Investigator. Clinically significant laboratory abnormalities at any visit will be followed to resolution (return to normal or to the Ba seline state) or until clinically stable as determined by the 
Investigator until the study database is closed .  
 Pregnancy T ests 
All WOCBP will have a serum pregnancy test as per the SoA (Table  1), and serum or urine 
pregnancy tests at all other study visits. If the WOCBP becomes pregnant during the course of the study, she must immediately stop applying the IP and report the finding to the Investigator. Potential teratogenicity should be discussed at each visit with  WOCBP and with 
male subjects with partners who are WOCBP.  
8.4 Other A ssessments  
 PK A ssessments  
A plasma sample will be collected prior to application of IP per the SoA  (Table  1). At 
Baseline, PK samples will be collected prior to the first dose and the date and time of the first dose will be recorded. Post -Baseline, the date and time of the last dose prior to collection of 
the PK sample must be recorded. 
 Genomic S ample  
A separate, specific signature will be required to  document a subject’s agreement to provide 
additional samples for optional genomic research. From subjects who agree to participate and provide their additional, specific consent, a blood specimen will be collected at the Baseline Visit for genomic testing . This specimen will be used to study genetic and genomic 
mechanisms involved in Gorlin Syndrome pathogenesis, disease progression, and outcome. Stored specimens may also be used to  evaluate the association of genetic and genomic

9.1 Methods of Assig ning Subjects to Treatment Groups  
This is a double-blind study. The study s ite will assign e ach consented  subject a unique 
 subject number consisting of the study site number and the  
chronological Screening order number, starting with  Site 
numbers will be assigned by country and/or region. Subjects who progress to enroll ment  in 
the study will retain their Screening  number upon Randomization.  
The IP accountability  log will be completed by the site pharmacist (or qualified designee), 
and the IP tubes will be provided in a single boxed kit containing  3 tubes of IP gel . It is 
recommended that subjects use tubes consecutively, exhausting the first tube before opening 
and beginning use of subsequent tubes.  
Subjects will be stratified for enrollment based on the following criteria:  
1. ) 
2. Gender at birth  
3. History of prior HHI therapy  ) 
9.2 Randomization and Blinding  
The IPs  will be packaged and labeled identically, and the IP  kits will be numbered and 
dispensed according to the subject’s assigned randomization number for  the study. IP  
supplies will be distributed to the study site  to maintain the randomization ratio.  
As a double- blinded study, the Investigators, the site staff, PellePharm, and the Clinical 
Monitor(s) will be blinded to the treatment assigned to individual subjects. Delegated staff 
members at the study site will dispense the IP and will collect and weigh all used and unused 
IP tubes, as scheduled.  
9.3 Unblinding  
In the case of a medical emergency, subject symptoms must be treated empirically. There is 
no known antidote for patidegib. In a medical emergency, u nblinding may not necessarily 
improve the care of the subject.  Unblinding may be considered when there are two or more identical SAEs that are 
unexpected but considered related  to study drug. Should the Inv estigator feel that unblinding 
is essential, the Investigator should endeavor to contact the PelleP harm designated Medical 
Monitor to further discuss the situation .  
9.4 Treatment Compliance  
Subjects will be required to return the IP tubes that are used and /or unused. Each subject will 
be instructed on the importance of both the application of the IP and return of the used and

the source document and eCRF.  
Any i nterruptions in the schedule of IP administration or use of prohibited concomitant 
medication  will be recorded in the eCRFs.  
9.5 Protocol Deviations  
A PD  is any change, divergence, or departure from the study design or procedures defined in 
the protocol. Majo r PDs  are a subset of PDs that might significantly affect the completeness, 
accuracy, and/or reliability of the study data or that might significantly affect a subject's 
rights, safety, or well-being.12 If a major (important) PD has been identified , it should be 
communicated to and discussed with the Medical Monitor . A corrective and preventative 
action (CAPA) plan may be required to be instituted in the case of major PDs at the site.  In 
the event of recurring major PDs , the site enro llment may be halted by the Medical Monitor, 
in consultation with PellePharm, until a CAPA plan has been instituted and the issue(s) resolved. PDs should be reported on at least an annual basis to the Central IRB or the site ’s 
local IRB/IEC.

PROPRIETARY AND CONFIDENTIAL   Page 40 of 73 that may compromise the IP shipment will require that the IP kits  are quarantined until 
review by the Study Monitor.  
For IP received undamaged, IP will be inventoried and the IP inventory/accountability log 
completed. IP will be stored in a  
in a secure and restricted location . 
Upon enrollment and randomization of a subject, the pharmacist (or designee) will s elect the 
IP kit based on the randomization number provided by the Interactive Web/Phone Randomization System ( IxRS ). The initial application of the IP will take place in the clinic 
under observation. No other IP applications at subsequent visit s will be required to be 
observed in the clinic setting. However, where it is suspected that inappropriate amounts of IP are being applied by the subject  (based on tube weights) further review of IP application in 
the clinic may be warranted.  
The subject will return  all IP gel tube s (used , partially used, and/or unused) at their 
subsequent study visit. If any IP gel tubes are lost or damaged between clinic visits, 
additional IP may be provided to the subject. The goal is to ensure that the subject has an 
adequate sup ply of IP to  be able to administer all scheduled treatments.  
Refer to the Pharmacy Manual for additional details about administration requirements, IP 
supply, and accountability procedures. 
10.3 Storage and Handling of Investigational Product 
The IP tubes should be stored  
 
10.4 Application  
The Investigator or site personnel will instruct the subject on how to apply the IP at the 
Baseline V isit and the subject will apply th e IP at that visit under observation. The IP should 
be applied to the face , which will be defined as the area extending from the anterior hairline 
to the jaw line (except the eyelids) including the  ears. If the anterior hairline is receding, 
application of  IP to  the forehead will extend no more than 9 cm above the eyebrow or 
superior orbital ridge . 
The Investigator or site personnel  will instruct the subject on the proper use of laminated 
dosing cards during the Baseline V isit. In addition to the verbal ins tructions given during the 
visit, written and/or other media IP application instructions may be provided to the subjects. 
Subjects should be encouraged to keep facial hair short enough to allow adequate application 
of IP to the face , and subjects must remove make- up prior to IP application . 
Subjects will be instructed to wash their face and hands within approximately 10 minutes 
prior to IP application.  Subjects will apply their first dose at the study site under observation.

PROPRIETARY AND CONFIDENTIAL   Page 41 of 73 Subjects will apply to the face an amount squeezed out as a specified amount on a laminated  
dosing card ( ), avoiding the eyelids (as described 
above and in the Pharmacy Manual). If no observable AEs  are noted within a  
observation period after their first application, subjects can leave the site.  Subjects will be 
advised to minimize exposure to direct sunlight while in the study and to wash their hands 
before and after application of the IP . 
 
. If an IP application has been missed or delayed such that there would be 
 between applications, the subject should not apply that dose of IP and just wait to 
apply the next dose. Th e importance of IP compliance should be discussed with the subject 
during each site visit.  
Subjects will be instructed to store their IP in a secure location away from children. WOCBP  
should not come in contact with the gel unless avoiding pregnancy. The amount of IP used by the subjects will be monitored by weighing each returned IP tube 
at all applicable study visits.  If it is suspected that inappropriate amounts of IP are being 
applied by the subject (based on tube weights) further review of IP application in the clini c 
may be warranted.  
10.5 Investigational Product  Accountability  and Disposal  
Upon receipt of the IP , the Investigator (or designee, e.g., study center pharmacist) will 
acknowledge receipt of the IP after reviewing the shipment’s content and condition. The 
Inves tigator (or designee) is responsible for ensuring that the designated study site staff 
conduct a complete inventory of study materials and assume responsibility for their storage and dispensing. The Investigator (or designee)  must agree to keep all study materials in a 
secure location with restricted access. The Investigator (or designee) will keep a record of the inventory and dispensing of a ll IPs . This record will be made available to the Study Monitor 
for the purpose of accounting for al l clinical supplies. Any significant discrepancy and/or 
deficiency must be recorded with an explanation. 
All supplies sent to the investigators will be accounted for and, in no case, used in any 
unauthorized situation. Each tube of IP adminis tered at the s tudy center will be administered 
by qualified study center staff. At each site visit, IP compliance will be discussed with the 
subject. At the end of the study, following final IP inventory reconciliation by the monitor, the study 
site will dispose of and/or destroy all supplies (including used, partially used, and/or un used 
tubes of IP ) where possible, in compliance with the site’s SOP s for IP disposal/destruction.  In 
the event that the site is unable to dispose of and/or destroy IP sup plies, the Sponsor w ill be 
notified and a third-party vendor may be contracted to manage destruction of IP supplies.

11.1 Adverse Events  
 Definition of Adverse Event  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject administered a medicinal product 
and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the medicinal (investigational) product . AEs include any unfavorable and unintended illness, sign ( e.g., including an 
abnormal laboratory finding) , symptom, clinically significant laboratory test abnormality, or 
disease associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product that has  appeared or 
worsened du ring the course of the clinical trial, regardless of causal relationship to the 
medicinal (investigational) product under study.  
Subjects will be questioned about any concurrent illness or systemic sign or symptom. Any 
incidence of  these systemic signs or  symptoms will be reported on the AE eCRF. 
Vital signs and laboratory abnormalities are to be recorded as AEs only if they are clinically significant (for example: are symptomatic, requiring corrective treatment, leading to discontinuation or fulfilling a seriousness criterion).  A laboratory abnormality that is part of 
an efficacy endpoint (e.g., histologic confirmation of BCC on a biopsy) is not to be reported 
as an AE.  
An unexpected AE is one that is not listed in the Investigator’ s Brochure (IB) or is no t listed 
at the specificity or severity that has been observed.  
 Documenting Adverse Events  
It is the responsibility of the Investigator to document in the eCRF all AEs /SAEs  that occur 
during the course of the study. AEs /SAEs  should be collected after the i nformed consent 
form is signed and usually at the Screening visit. T he AEs /SAEs  should be documented as a 
single medical diagnosis. When this is not possible, the AE /SAEs  should be documented in 
terms of signs and/or symptoms observed by the Investigator or reported by the subject at each study visit.  
All AEs /SAEs  occurring after the  subject signs the informed consent through the last study 
visit must be reported, regardless of whether or not t he AEs /SAEs  are considered drug -
related. A ll AEs /SAEs , whether in response to a query, observed by the study site personnel, 
or reported spontaneously by the subject, will be recorded. 
At each visit during the study, the subject will be assessed for the occurrence of new and 
ongoing AEs. Dermal safety and tolerability that res ult in the subject requiring a concomitant 
therapy or discontinuation from the study will be reported as an AE /SAE . The following data 
will be collected on all AEs and recorded on the appropriate e CRF:  
• Event name (diagnosis preferred, if unknown, record the signs/symptoms) 
PellePharm, Inc.  
Phase 3 Efficacy and Safety for Reduction of Disease Burden of Basal Cell Carcinomas  
Pelle -926-301, Protocol Amendment 3, 04JAN2021 
PROPRIETARY AND CONFIDENTIAL   Page 44 of 73 • Onset date and end date 
• Maximum severity  
• Seriousness 
• Action taken regarding IP 
• Corrective treatment, if given  
• Outcome 
In addition, the Investigator’s assessment of causality will be recorded   
It is not necessary to capture multiple occurrences of an AE  separately if the event recurs at 
short intervals. In such instances the end date of the AE is the date when the event resolved 
last and did not recur. If however the event recurs after long intervals, then the subsequent event may b e captured as a separate event. The PI may use his discretion to determine what 
constitutes a long or short interval between events and which event is reported once versus more than once. Furthermore, protocol defined end points (e.g new BCCs on the face, nSEBs  
on the face and BCC surgeries on the face) will be summarized as efficacy parameters and are not to be reported as AEs/ SAEs . 
In the clinical database, all AEs including SAEs are to be followed for a minimum up to the 
30 day follow up visit. In the source documents, any and all A Es including SAEs must be 
thoroughly documented to conclusion or in the opinion of the investigator, the event has 
resolved  or stabilized . 
 Serious Adverse Events 
All AEs will be assessed as either serious or non -serious. 
An SAE  or serious adverse reaction is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that at 
any dose: 
• Results in death  
• Is immediately life threatening, (the term "life threatening" in the definition of 
"serious" refers to an event in which the subject is at risk of deat h at the time of 
the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe)  
• Requires in -patient  hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization 
(hospitalization for elective surgery for a condi tion present at Screening is not 
considered an AE) 
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (permanent or substantial 
disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions)  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
PellePharm, Inc.  
Phase 3 Efficacy and Safety for Reduction of Disease Burden of Basal Cell Carcinomas  
Pelle -926-301, Protocol Amendment 3, 04JAN2021 
PROPRIETARY AND CONFIDENTIAL   Page 45 of 73 • Is a medica lly important event that may not be immediately life threatening or 
result in death or hospitalization, but may jeopardize the subject and may require 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent any of the above listed outcomes 
If the BCC surgery requires as pe r standard of care, that the patient be hospitalized, then this 
hospitalization is not an SAE. 
Note: A spontaneous abortion will be considered an SAE and must be reported per Reporting 
of SAEs under Section  11.1.6. Pregnancy in and of itself is not an SAE, but a subject who 
becomes pregnant must discontinue IP application immediately and the pregnancy will be 
followed to term (and ideally the child will be followed afterward if the subject consents) or termination . Any birth defect or other serious issue that may arise during the pregnancy or 
due to fetal exposur e will be considered an SAE.   
 Assessment of Severity  
The severity assigned to an AE should be determined by the maximum severity of the AE. The categories described below should be used to estimate the severity  of AEs:  
• Mild: Transient or mild discomfort; n o limitation in activity; no medical 
intervention/therapy required  
• Moderate:  Mild to moderate limitation in activi ty; some assistance may be 
needed; no or minimal medical intervention/therapy required  
• Severe:  Marked limitation in activity; some assistance usually required; medical 
intervention/therapy required; hospitalization or prolongation of current 
hospitalization possible; may be incapacitating or life threatening  
 Assessment of Causality  
The Investigator should assess the relationship of the AE, if an y, to the IP. The following 
should be taken into account when assessing SAE causality: 
• Positive temporal relations hip to IP , such as if the IP  was discontinued and the 
SAE resolved or the event recurred after re -introduction. 
• If there is a reasonable possibility that the AE is associated with an underlying or 
concomitant illness.  
• Possible association with previous or concomitant therapy. 
• No temporal relationship to the IP  and/or a more likely alternative etiology exists.  
• If the AE is directly related to study procedures or a lack of efficacy.  
The following classifications should be used when evaluating the relationship of AEs and 
SAEs to the investigational drug. 
1. Not Related : No relationship between the experience and the administration of IP; 
related to other etiologies such as concomitant medications or subject’s clinical state.  
2. Unlikely : The current state of knowledge indicates that a relationship is unlikely.   
PellePharm, Inc.  
Phase 3 Efficacy and Safety for Reduction of Disease Burden of Basal Cell Carcinomas  
Pelle -926-301, Protocol Amendment 3, 04JAN2021 
PROPRIETARY AND CONFIDENTIAL   Page 46 of 73 3. Possibly : A reaction that follows a plausible temporal sequence from administration of 
the IP  and follows a known response pattern to the suspected IP. The reaction might have 
been produced by the subject’s cli nical state or other modes of therapy administered to 
the subject . 
4. Probably:  A reaction that follows a plausible temporal sequence from administration of 
the IP  and follows a known response pattern to the suspected IP. The reaction cannot be 
reasonably exp lained by the known characteristics of the subject’s clinical state or other 
modes of therapy administered to the subject. 
5. Definitely : A reaction that follows a plausible temporal sequence from administration of 
the IP  and follows a known response pattern to the suspected IP  and can be confirmed 
with a positive re-challenge test or supporting laboratory data. 
 Reporting of Serious Adverse Events 
SAE s will be captured in both the clinical and safety database.  
All SAEs, regardless of cause or relationship, th at occurs after the subject first consents to 
participate in the study (i.e., signs the informed consent) and throughout the duration of the 
study and for 30 days following the last IP application will be captured in the clinical database via the eCRFs (Se ction  11.1.2).  
SAEs also will be captured i n the safety database. An initial SAE Report must be completed 
for all SAEs (irrespective of relatedness) with an onset date within 30 days from the date of last IP ap plication . An initial SAE Report must also be completed for Related SAEs 
(possibly, probably or definitely) regardless of the time elapsed from the last dose (even if the study has been closed). 
When new, significant information for an SAE is obtain ed, as well as when the outcome of 
an SAE is known, the Investigator must submit a Follow-Up Report. If the subject was 
hospitalized, a copy of the discharge summary must be included as part of the subject’s 
medical file.  For related events,  the Investigator should monitor the subject until the outcome 
of the SAE is known. This may require periodic Follow-Up Reports. 
PellePharm and the study CRO must be notified of all SAEs (regardless of ca usal 
relationship to IP) within 24 hours of the Inve stigator’s knowledge of the event by faxing or 
emailing a completed SAE report to the CRO Medical Monitor.  
If there are serious, unexpect ed AEs associated with the use of the IP, PellePharm (or 
designee) will notify the appropriate regulatory agency(ies) and all appropriate parties  as 
appropriate (e .g., IRB)  on an expedited basis. It is the responsibility of the Investigator to 
promptly notify the IRB/IEC of all unexpected SAEs involving risk to human subjects. 
 Emergency Contact  
In the event of a medical emergency (i.e., an eve nt that requires immediate attention 
regarding the treatment of a subject, operation of the clinical study, and/or the use of

Monitor to discuss the situation . 
 Expedited Serious Adverse Event Reports 
An AE, whether serious or non-serious, is designated unexpected if it is not reported in the 
reference safety section of the IB  or if the event is of greater frequency, specificity or 
severity  than so reported. 
PellePha rm will notify regulatory authorities of unexpected related S AEs and all 
participating study sites in writing for submission by the Investigator to the IRB/IEC. This notification will be in the form of a Safety Update to the IB  (i.e., “15- day letter”).  
Upon receiving such notices, the Investigator must review and retain the notice with the IB 
and immediately submit a copy of this information to the responsible IRB/IEC , according to 
local regulations. The Investigator and IRB/IEC wi ll determine if the informed consent 
requires revision. The Investigator should also comply with the IRB/IEC procedures for 
reporting any other safety information.

PROPRIETARY AND CONFIDENTIAL   Page 50 of 73 12.6.2 Efficacy Analyses  
The primary endpoint is the number of new BCCs  per subject that develop from baseline to  
Month 12. The number of new BCCs that develop from Baseline to Month 12 will be 
analyzed using a negative binomial regression to compare treatment groups with number of BCCs at Baseline, Age ), gender, prior HHI therapy, and geographic 
region str ata (North America, Europe) as covariates. PROC GENMOD of SAS will be used 
with distribution=Negbin . 
In or der to assess the impact of parametric assumptions, a  non- parametric rank analysis of 
covariance (ANCOVA, Stokes et al) will be provided as a sensitivity analysis with number of 
BCCs at Baseline, prior HHI therapy, gender, age ), and geographic 
region as covariates.   
The Negative Binomial regression  was selected as the primary method of analysis to account 
for the potential for over dispersion. Using the Negative Binomial model, the power will be 
somewhat higher than the one calcu lated using a non- parametric Wilcoxon -Mann -Whitney 
test. The proposed sensitivity  analysis , Rank ANCOVA, was selected to corroborate the 
results from the Neg ative Binomial model. If the distribution is markedly  different from 
Negative Binomial (and unknown to sufficiently allow a different parametric regression 
model), then the non-parametric ANCOVA gives type- 1 error close r to the nominal level. 
The number of  nSEBs that develop from Baseline to Month 12 will be analyzed using a 
Negative Binomial regression  to compare treatment groups with number of BCCs at 
Baseline, Age  ), gender, prior HHI therapy, and geographic region as 
covariates. Secondary endpoints that are based on number of new B CCs will be analyzed 
similar to the primary endpoint. The proportion of subjects with at least two new B CCs 
lesions and the proportion of subjects with at least one n ew B CC lesion will be analyzed 
using a logi stic regression to compare treatment groups with number of BCCs at Baseline, 
Age ), Gender, and prior HHI therapy and geographic region as covariates. 
Change in aBCCdex will be analyzed using an ANCOVA model with treatment group as a 
main effect, Baseline aBCCdex, prior HHI therapy, gender, a ge strata , and geographic region 
as covariates.  Testing of secondary endpoints will be done sequentially at a two-sided 0.05 
level .  
The primary method for dealing with missing data will be the MI method discussed in detail 
in Section  12.7.6. 
LOCF and observed case analyses will be done as sensitivity analyses.

erythema, and edema will  be summarized descriptively by treatment group and visit. 
12.7.2 Adverse Events  
Subjects will be assessed for the occurrence of new and ongoing AEs. Descriptions of AEs 
will include the dates of onset and resolution (if resolved), maximum severity, seriousness, action taken regarding the IP, corrective treatment, outcome, and Investig ator’s assessment of 
causality. All AEs will be recorded and classified using terminology from the MedDRA. All reported TEAEs, defined as any AE with an onset on or after the date of first IP  application, 
or worsening of an AE with an onset prior to first IP application, will be summarized by treatment group, the number of subjects reporting TEAEs, system organ class, preferred 
term, severity, and relationship to IP . When summarizing TEAEs by severity or relationship 
to IP , each subject will be counted only once within a system organ class or a preferred term 
using the event with the greatest severity or causality, respectively, within each category. All 
reported SAEs will be summarize d by treatment group, the number of subjects reporting 
SAEs, system organ class, preferred term, severity, and relationship to IP . 
All information pertaining to AEs noted during the study will be listed by subject and will include a verbatim description of the event as reported by the Investigator , as well as the 
preferred term,  system organ class, start date, stop date (if stopped), seriousness, severity, 
action taken regarding the IP, corrective treatment, outcome and relationship to the IP . In 
addition, a listing of subjects who prematurely discontinue from the study due to AE s will be 
provided as well as a listing of subjects who reported an SAE. 
12.7.3 Physical Examination Including Vital Sign Results  
Changes from Baseline in vital sign measurements will be summarized with descriptive 
statistics for each treatment group at all applicable study visits.  
12.7.4 Safety Laboratory Values 
Changes from Baseline in safety laboratory values will be summarized with descriptive statistics for each treatment group at all applicable study visits.  
Shift tables will be presented for changes in safety labo ratory values to summarize laboratory 
test results collected at Screening  to Baseline (Day 1) and at Months 1, 3, 6, 9, and 
Month 12/ Exit Visit. Normal ranges established by the loca l laboratory will be used to 
determine the shifts. A listing of all out-of- range laboratory test results at any assessment

laborato ry values will be made by each Investigator and reported as an AE accordingly . In 
addition, a listing of all clinically significant laboratory test results will be provided.  
12.7.5 Pregnancy Tests  
Pregnancy test results will be presented in a data listing.  
12.7.6 Handling of Missing Data  
The primary m ethod for dealing with missing data will be the MI method. The MI model will 
be detailed in the SAP. One hundred imputations will be generated using PROC MI of SAS. Fully Conditional Specification (FCS) model will be used with either new BCCs or nSEBs at prior post- Baseline visits, treatment group, number of BCCs  at Baseline, prior HHI therapy, 
gender, age strata, and geographic region as covariates to impute the data. The seed to be 
used is 20180330. The results of the 100 analyses will be transformed into a normal statistic and combined into a single analysis using PROC MIANALYZE. 
LOCF and observed case analyses will be done as sensitivity analyses.  
12.7.7 Multicenter Issues  
For the purpose of the summaries and analyses, the term ‘Center’ will be used to define each 
study site. All data collected from participating Centers will be monitored and reviewed as specified in this protocol.  
Approximately 50 Center s are planned in this study to enable a sufficient number of subjects 
to be enrolled . In the event that a  Center has low numbers of subjects enrolled, pooling of 
results for C enters may be performed. The algorithm for pooling of C enters will be described 
in the SAP . Descriptive summary statistics will be generated including Center and pooled-
Center (when appropriate) by primary and secondary efficacy endpoints.  
12.7.8 Multiplicity Issues  
Testing of secondary endpoints will be done sequentially at a two- sided 0.05 level.

Version 3.2 10.12.21 Page. 238 Abstract:
39
40 Basal-bolus insulin therapy is recommended for patients with poorly controlled type 2 
41 diabetes and HbA1c >9%. However, basal-bolus insulin is labor intensive and associated with 
42 increased risk of hypoglycemia, glycemic variability, weight gain and poor compliance. Thus, 
43 there is a critical need for a simpler treatment regimen that could overcome these limitations. 
44 IDegLira, a fixed-ratio combination (FRC) therapy consisting of insulin degludec and liraglutide, 
45 is an attractive option for this population given its proven benefits on glycemic control, weight 
46 and compliance. Accordingly, we propose a prospective randomized controlled trial comparing 
47 IDegLira and basal-bolus insulin therapy in achieving glycemic control (efficacy end-point), while 
48 preventing hypoglycemia and reducing glycemic variability and weight gain (safety end-point) in 
49 patients with uncontrolled T2D and HbA1c between ≥ 9-15%. This study aims to show that a 
50 simpler regimen using a novel FRC agent (IDegLira) can improve glycemic control, decrease 
51 hypoglycemia, reduce the burden of diabetes care, and improve satisfaction/adherence in 
52 patients with poorly controlled T2D with HbA1c between ≥ 9-15%. This open-label, treat-to- 
53 target, two-arm parallel, controlled trial will randomize (1:1 ratio) patients with T2D and HbA1c ≥ 
54 9%, treated with oral antidiabetic agents and/or basal insulin therapy (TDD ≤50 units), to 
55 lDegLira or basal-bolus insulin for 26 weeks. We will recruit a total of 150 patients from 
56 participating institutions. We anticipate recruiting 3-4 patients per week for a total recruitment 
57 period of approximately 12 months.

Version 3.2 10.12.21 Page. 359 BACKGROUND:
60
61 Extensive literature from landmark studies have shown that persistent hyperglycemia is 
62 associated with short- and long-term complications1,2. The UKPDS study, the largest study in 
63 patients with type 2 diabetes, showed that intensive glycemic control can reduce the risk of 
64 microvascular complications1-3. Sustained hyperglycemia, also known as glucotoxicity, leads to 
65 progressive loss of beta-cell function and is considered a key pathophysiological process in the 
66 development of T2D4. Patients with severe hyperglycemia may respond poorly to oral anti- 
67 diabetic agents (OAD) alone initially and frequently require insulin to achieve glycemic targets 
685,6. Current guidelines recommend to initiate therapy with basal insulin and progressively step- 
69 up to basal-bolus insulin in patients with high HbA1c >9%, particularly if symptomatic or with 
70 catabolic symptoms6-8.
71 Basal-bolus insulin regimen increases the risk of hypoglycemia, weight gain and  
72 glycemic variability9,10, which are limiting factors in achieving glycemic targets. Basal-bolus 
73 insulin regimen is also labor intensive and often requires multiple daily injections, further 
74 increasing the burden of diabetes care11-14 and decreasing patient adherence 12,13. In contrast, 
75 simplified treatment plans may improve adherence, leading to glycemic targets 
76 achievement12,13,15. Thus, there is a critical need for simpler regimens that could overcome 
77 clinical inertia, improve patient adherence, and decrease glycemic variability in patients with 
78 poorly controlled type 2 diabetes. With the advent of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM), we 
79 have recognized that hypoglycemia and glycemic variability are common events in many 
80 patients, even in patients with well-controlled T2D16-20. Despite large data supporting the efficacy 
81 and safety of combination therapy with basal insulin and GLP1-RA -including fixed-ratio 
82 combination (FRC) agents 21,22; no previous studies have compared the efficacy and safety of 
83 IDegLira in patients with very high HbA1c vs the standard-of-care with basal-bolus insulin 
84 regimen. Accordingly, this prospective randomized control trial will compare IDegLira to basal 
85 bolus insulin regimen in achieving glycemic control (efficacy end-point), while reducing 
86 hypoglycemia, glycemic variability and weight gain (safety end-point) in patients with 
87 uncontrolled T2D and HbA1c ≥9%.
88
Version 3.2 10.12.21 Page. 489 SPECIFIC AIMS:
90 Specific Aim 1:
91 1. To determine whether treatment with IDegLira will result in similar improvement in 
92 glycemic control, as measured by change in HbA1c (non-inferiority limit of 0.4%), 
93 compared to treatment with basal-bolus insulin regimen in patients with poorly 
94 controlled T2D (HbA1c ≥9-15%).
95 -Primary outcome: change in HbA1c from baseline after 26 weeks of treatment with 
96 IDegLira vs basal-bolus insulin (with metformin, unless contraindicated).
97 -Hypothesis: After 26 weeks of treatment, IDegLira will result in similar improvement in 
98 glycemic control compared to basal-bolus insulin therapy.
99 Specific Aim 2:
100 2.To determine whether treatment with IDegLira will result in lower rate of 
101 hypoglycemic events and less glycemic variability (superiority), as measured by 
102 continuous glucose monitoring (CGM), compared to basal-bolus insulin in patients 
103 with T2D and HbA1c >9-15%.
104 -Patients with poorly controlled T2D randomized to IDegLira or basal-bolus (with 
105 metformin, unless contraindicated) will have a one-week blinded CGM study performed 
106 during follow-up visits at 1, 12, and 26 weeks as well as 8-point self-monitored blood 
107 glucose (SMBG). CGM will allow better detection of hypoglycemic events, particularly 
108 asymptomatic and nocturnal hypoglycemia. It will also provide critical information on 
109 time in glycemic range and glycemic variability.
110 -Hypothesis: IDegLira will result in less hypoglycemia and glycemic variability 
111 compared to basal-bolus insulin regimen.
112 Specific Aim 3 :
113 3.To determine whether treatment with IDegLira will result in improved patient 
114 satisfaction compared to treatment with basal-bolus in patients with T2D and high 
115 HbA1c (>9-15%).
116 -Patients with poorly controlled T2D randomized to IDegLira or Basal-Bolus will 
117 complete the Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire (DTSQ) and Treatment-
118 related impact measures for diabetes (TRIM-D) survey during follow-up visits.
119 -Hypothesis: Use of IDegLira is associated with higher patient satisfaction and 
120 adherence compared to a multiple-daily injection regimen with basal-bolus insulin.

122 CURRENT STATUS OF WORK IN THE FIELD
123 Epidemiology and treatment of patients with poorly controlled T2D and HbA1c >9%
124
125
126 Based on NHANES data from 2007-2010, up to 
127 12.6% of patients with diagnosed diabetes (18.8 millions) 
128 have an HbA1c >9%23. In the Emory Health Care system, 
129 the largest academic health system in Georgia, over 
130 64,000 patients have a diagnosis of diabetes, with ~16% 
131 having an HbA1c>9% (Figure 1). The evidence on the 
132 management of patients with T2D and very high HbA1c is 
133 very limited, with most studies excluding patients with 
134 HbA1c > 10%24-27. Figure 1. HbA1c Distribution in Patients 135 with Diabetes: US and Emory Data

150 In a recent multi-national study of insulin-naïve patients with T2D, treated with or without 
151 oral agents, showed that only ~40% of patients with HbA1c > 9% were started on basal insulin. 
152 Moreover, the study showed that only 20.9% of such patients achieved HgA1c target (< 7%) at 3 
153 months after initiating basal insulin, indicating a need for coverage of prandial-related 
154 hyperglycemic excursions. Notably, failure to achieve HbA1c targets at 3 months was associated 
155 with an increased risk of not achieving HbA1c targets at 24 months, with < 30% of patients 
156 achieving glycemic targets28. This study suggests that providers delayed initiation of basal insulin 
157 as recommended by national guidelines, and frequently failed to intensify therapy to cover 
158 prandial-related hyperglycemic excursions. A recent study in ambulatory patients with T2D and 
159 high HbA1c (>10%) on metformin and sulfonylurea treatment, randomized patients to 
160 combination (COMB) therapy with exenatide plus pioglitazone vs basal-bolus insulin regimen. 
161 COMB provided greater HbA1c reduction at 6 months, with significantly less weight gain. 
162 However, the rates of hypoglycemia were unusually high, up to 56% and 83% in COMB and BB, 
163 respectively26. Our group recently validated the efficacy of a hospital discharge algorithm based 
164 on the admission HbA1c27. Among those patients with high admission HbA1c> 9% (n: 81), 54 
165 were discharged on basal-bolus insulin regimen. Mean admission HbA1c of 11.1% decreased to 
166 8.8% and to 8.0% after 4 and 12 weeks of hospital discharge (p<0.01), respectively. However, up 
167 to 44% of patients had hypoglycemia (BG < 70 mg/dl) during follow-up. Thus, there is a critical 
168 need for effective but safe and simpler anti-diabetic regimen for this high-risk population.

171 “Standards-of-Care” for Patients with Severe Hyperglycemia
Version 3.2 10.12.21 Page. 6172 Based on expert consensus, the American Diabetes Association recommends “dual 
173 therapy” for patients with HbA1c >9% to achieve glycemic targets faster than with “sequential 
174 therapy” after 3 months of not achieving such targets. Based on historical availability and with 
175 no hierarchical preference by the ADA, dual therapy includes metformin and any of the following 
176 agents: sulfonylureas (SU), thiazolidinedione (TZD), glinides (GLN) dipeptidyl peptidase-4 
177 inhibitors (DPP-4), SGLT-2 inhibitors, GLP-1 agonists and basal insulin8. Similarly, the American 
178 Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) based on expert consensus recommends the 
179 addition of insulin in patients with HbA1c >9% if symptomatic, or on maximum doses of dual 
180 therapy6. Moreover, in patients with HbA1c >8% on dual therapy and/or long history of diabetes, 
181 AACE suggests that the addition of insulin will more likely achieve glycemic targets over adding 
182 a third agent6. It was also suggested that the addition of GLP-1 to dual oral therapy may 
183 similarly help achieving glycemic targets6, but still many patients will require insulin in this 
184 scenario29,30. In patients with HbA1c > 10%, or blood glucose > 300 mg/dl, and/or symptomatic 
185 hyperglycemia (polyuria or polydipsia) and catabolic symptoms (ketosis and weight loss), the 
186 ADA recommends “combination insulin injectable therapy”. This regimen includes: basal-bolus 
187 insulin or basal plus GLP1-RA or pre-mixed insulin8. Notably, recommendations from national 
188 guidelines in this area are mostly based on expert consensus and the notion that “dual injectable 
189 therapy” for patients with HbA1c >9% may achieve glycemic targets faster than with “sequential 
190 therapy” after re-evaluation every three months, rather than based on strong clinical trials 
191 evidence6,8. Unfortunately, the evidence is very limited in patients with T2D and v e r y  high 
192 HbA1c, with most studies excluding patients with HbA1c > 10%24-27.
193
194 In clinical practice, many patients with uncontrolled T2D and HbA1c > 9% are started on 
195 basal insulin, followed by dose up-titration and addition of prandial insulin (basal bolus)–in 
196 concordance with national guidelines6,8. Intensive insulin therapy, by either continuous 
197 subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) or multiple daily insulin injections (MDI), early in the 
198 disease course of patients with T2D results in rapid glycemic control within days, suggesting 
199 that avoiding the negative effects of long-term exposure to hyperglycemia may prevent further 
200 beta-cell failure31-33. However, the basal bolus regimen increases the risk of hypoglycemia and 
201 weight gain9,10, which are well-recognized limiting factors to achieve glycemic targets. More 
202 importantly, basal bolus regimen is labor intensive and increases the burden of diabetes care, 
203 number of injections per day 11-14, which may lead to poor patient adherence, increase re- 
204 admission rates, and increased risk of hypoglycemia 12,13. Studies comparing GLP1-RA therapy
205 vs thrice-daily bolus insulin added to basal insulin plus oral agents have found similar HbA1c 
Version 3.2 10.12.21 Page. 7206 reduction30,34,35 accompanied by weight loss compared to weight gain in basal-bolus insulin 
207 regimen30,35. GLP1-RA therapy was also associated with better patient satisfaction and better 
208 quality of life34. Indeed, the combination of basal insulin and GLP1-RA is an attractive and 
209 simpler option for many patients with uncontrolled diabetes – ideally in a single daily injection 
210 from a fixed-ratio combination agent. Moreover, there is evidence suggesting that GLP-1 
211 agonist therapy may preserve beta-cell function36. Based on data from meta-analysis and 
212 randomized studies34,35,37, some authors favor this combination over basal-bolus insulin in 
213 patients with uncontrolled T2D on basal insulin38,39.
214
215 Combination of basal insulin and GLP-1 agonists – fixed-ratio combination agents
216 The combination of basal insulin and GLP1-RA therapy offers a complementary 
217 mechanism to target the main physiologic defects in T2D, by addressing fasting and prandial 
218 hyperglycemia 21,22. GLP1-RAs decrease post-prandial glycemic excursions and complement 
219 basal-insulin therapy by enhancing endogenous insulin responses in a glucose-dependent 
220 manner, inhibiting glucagon secretion, slowing gastric emptying and promoting satiety40. This 
221 combination has been shown to provide better glycemic control, less hypoglycemia, less weight 
222 gain, and reduce glycemic variability compared to basal bolus therapy or GLP1-RA 
223 alone21,22,41,42. IDegLira is a novel fixed-ratio combination of degludec 100 u/ml and liraglutide
224 3.6 mg in a pre-filled pen. IDegLira has been shown to improve glycemic control, with lower risk 
225 of hypoglycemia, less weight gain, and better patient satisfaction compared to basal-bolus or 
226 stepped-up basal therapy 43,44. Pharmacokinetics studies showed that IDegLira provided 
227 coverage over the 24-hours interval at steady levels43. In the recent DUAL V trial, IDegLira 
228 resulted in greater HbA1c reduction, weight loss and less hypoglycaemia, compared to up-
229 titration of insulin glargine in patients with T2D with HbA1c 7-10%45. More recently in the DUAL 
230 VII trial, patients with HgA1c 7-10% randomize to IDegLira had similar HbA1c reduction, but 
231 with an 89% reduction in the rate of severe or confirmed symptomatic hypoglycemia and weight 
232 loss compared to basal-bolus insulin46. Thus, IDegLira is an attractive and option for patients 
233 with severe hyperglycemia, due to potent HbA1c reduction, lower hypoglycemic risk, and 
234 flexibility of once-daily administration, compared to up to five injections per day in basal-bolus 
235 regimen. However, no previous studies have compared the efficacy and safety of IDegLira in 
236 patients with high HbA1c >9-15%.
237
238
239 SIGNIFICANCE AND INNOVATION:
Version 3.2 10.12.21 Page. 8240 The proposed study will test three innovative questions in patients with poorly controlled 
241 T2D and HbA1c >9%: 1) whether IDegLira, a novel FRC of degludec and liraglutide, results in 
242 similar glycemic control, 2) less hypoglycemia, less glycemic variability and less weight gain 
243 compared to a basal-bolus, and 3) whether IDegLira results in better patient satisfaction and 
244 treatment adherence compared to a more complex multiple-daily insulin injection regimen. If 
245 successful, this study will show that a once-a-day simpler regimen using IDegLira can improve 
246 glycemic control, decrease hypoglycemia, improve satisfaction and decrease the burden of 
247 diabetes care, which in turn will improve patient adherence. Since improvements in HbA1c 
248 strongly correlate with a reduction in the risk of microvascular and macrovascular complication3, 
249 improved glycemic control with a simpler regimen like IDegLira have the potential to reduce the 
250 burden of complications associated with T2D. In addition, we will perform professional/blinded 
251 CGM at weeks -1, 12 and 26 of follow-up. By incorporating CGM, we will improve our ability to 
252 detect asymptomatic/unrecognized and/or nocturnal hypoglycemia and assess glycemic 
253 variability17,47 compare to SMBG (standard-of-care). Since IDegLira therapy is expected to result 
254 in less clinical significant hypoglycemia (defined as interstitial glucose < 54 mg/dl), less 
255 nocturnal hypoglycemia and less glycemic variability (as measured by MAGE, %CV or SD) 
256 compared to basal-bolus, this simpler regimen could become the standard-of-care for patients 
257 with uncontrolled T2D and HbA1c > 9%.

302 investigating the efficacy and safety of lDegLira versus basal-bolus insulin in patients with T2D. 
303 Patients with HbA1c ≥ 9% treated with oral antidiabetic agents and/or basal insulin therapy 
304 (TDD ≤50 units) will be randomized in a 1:1 manner to receive IDegLira or basal-bolus insulin 
305 regimen (plus metformin unless contraindicated), as shown in Fig 2. Subjects will have contact 
306 with the study team via clinic visits or phone contacts for a total of 29-weeks, as shown in the

314 screening/run-in period, randomization visit (visit 2), 26-week treatment period (visits 4-18), and 
315 a follow-up safety visit after the end the 26-weeks treatment period (visit 19). Subjects will have 
316 contact with the study team via clinic visits or phone contacts for a total of 9 clinic visits and 9 
317 telephone contacts. This study will include patients with a known history of T2D, age 18-80, 
318 treated with oral antidiabetic agents including metformin, sulfonylurea, repaglinide/nateglinide, 
319 pioglitazone, DPP4 inhibitors, SGLT2 inhibitors, (monotherapy + basal insulin) or in combination 
320 therapy (2-3 agents), and/or on basal insulin at a total daily dose (TDD) of ≤50 units. 
321 Participants previously using basal insulin [neutral protamine hagedorn (NPH), mixed insulin, 
322 detemir or glargine insulin], will be switched to study-provided Degludec or IDegLira and/or 
323 Aspart pens. Metformin will be continued at same dose during the study, unless contraindicated. 
324 Patients previously treated ambulatory with basal-bolus insulin therapy and/or GLP1-RA will be 
325 excluded. Patients transiently treated with  basal-bolus insulin (standard-of-care treatment) 
326 during hospital admission can be included. Recommendations on insulin adjustment will be 
327 provided at each visit or phone encounter by a study physician.
328
329 Rationale for study design
330 Based on the DUAL trial program, a total of 26 weeks of treatment is sufficient to reach 
331 stable HbA1c levels, with a minimum of 12 weeks in the maintenance period. This timeline has 
332 been previously shown to be sufficient to collect data for efficacy and safety. A parallel design 
333 will allow for assessment of efficacy and safety in the shortest time in each group, compared to 
334 a cross-over design. An open label design allows us to use a simpler regimen with a single 
335 injection of IDegLira, as blinding the subjects will require a double dummy design with three 
336 extra subcutaneous injections per day, thus imposing a high burden on subjects, thereby
337 increasing the non-compliance and withdrawal rates. Patients in both arms will 
338 receive the same degree of self-monitoring and follow-up. Patients will have 
Version 3.2 10.12.21 Page. 11339 blinded CGM to avoid the bias of glycemic improvement by using real-time glucose 
340 data from CGM. The primary endpoint will use HgA1c changes, a standard 
341 laboratory test shown to correlate with risk of diabetes complication, thus limiting 
342 the assessment bias. Secondary endpoints will include rates of asymptomatic 
343 hypoglycemia or nocturnal hypoglycemia as detected by CGM, which will typically 
344 not be detected by the standard-of-care SMBG.

Version 3.2 10.12.21 Page. 13397 Treatment of subjects: 
398 Group 1) IDegLira Group
399Discontinue OADs (SU, DPPIVi, glinides, and pioglitazone), except metformin 
400 (unless contraindicated) and SGLT2i. 
401Start IDegLira at 16 dose steps (degludec 16 units/liraglutide 0.6 mg), per U.S 
402 labeling indications and/or provider discretion.
403IDegLira will be given once daily, at the same time of the day with or without food.
404IDegLira will be titrated until the maximum dose (50 steps) is reached, up to target fasting 
405 BG between 70 and 100 mg/dl (Treat-To-Target Trial protocol), see algorithm below.
406Titration will occur twice a week: 1) self-titration by patients once a week and 2) phone call/ 
407 contact by research team once a week, for the initial 8 weeks. After that, patients will self-
408 titrate study medications per dosing algorithm. 
409IDegLira will be titrated by 2-step-dose increment (2 IU of degludec and 0.072 of liraglutide), 
410 to a maximum of 8 steps per week. 
411The maximum allowed dose of IDegLira 50 dose steps provide 50 U of degludec and 1.8mg 
412 of liraglutide.
413Titration will be performed twice weekly (every 3 to 4 days) based on the previous self-
414 monitored fasting (pre-breakfast) BG measurement (mean of 3 consecutive days). Patients 
415 will be provided with self-titration algorithms for insulin adjustments.
416Subjects not at goal (fasting or mean SMBG from 3 consecutive days > 300 mg/dl) requiring
417 > 50 dose steps of IDegLira, will be considered “treatment failures”. Degludec will be added 
418 to IDegLira as “rescue” basal insulin therapy. The dose of IDegLira will remain unchanged.
419The dose of “rescue” Degludec will be recorded and titrated twice weekly to target FPG of 
420 70-100 mg/dl, per provider discretion, as shown below.

424
425Discontinue OADs (SU, DPPIVi, glinides, and pioglitazone), except metformin (unless 
426 contraindicated) and SGLT2i. 
427Insulin naïve participants will start at a daily dose of 10 units of degludec U-100 (or 
428 0.2 u/kg/d per investigator discretion). 
429Participants previously using basal insulin [neutral protamine hagedorn (NPH), mixed 
430 insulin, detemir or glargine U100] will be switched to study-provided degludec pens. 
431For participants taking basal insulin prior to randomization, the conversion dose is 
432 1:1 unit. The total daily basal dose could be the same or reduced by 20% at the 
433 investigator’s discretion. 
434Titration will be performed twice weekly based on the previous self-monitored fasting (pre-
435 breakfast) BG measurement (mean of 3 consecutive days). Titration will occur as follows: 1) 
436 self-titration by patients once a week and 2) phone call/ contact by research team once a 
437 week, for the initial 8 weeks. After that, patients will self-titrate study medications per dosing 
438 algorithm. 
439 Degludec will be given once daily at the same time, and titrate up to fasting 
440 blood glucose 70-100 mg, with no maximum dose. 
441 Basal insulin should be adjusted before adjusting pre-meal aspart, as shown 
442 below.

452 Aspart Insulin dosage:
453 Aspart will be given before meals, to target pre-meal BG < 70-100 mg/dl.
454 At the start of the trial, participants will be prescribed 4 U insulin aspart before the 
455 largest/main meal or; before each main meal (3 typical large meals per day: 
456 breakfast, lunch, and dinner, <4 times per day) per investigator discretion. 
457For insulin naïve participants or per investigator discretion, total aspart dose will 
458 calculated at 0.2 u/kg/d, and equally divided in three doses to be started before the 
459 main/largest meal or before each meal (3 typical large meals per day: breakfast, 
460 lunch, and dinner, <4 times per day), per investigator discretion. 
461If patients are started on only one dose for the largest meal, a second and third dose 
462 may be added, as detailed above. Subjects will be provided with titration algorithms. 
463 The dose adjustment of insulin aspart will be based on the pre-prandial BG of the 
464 subsequent meal or bedtime BG (i.e. the pre-dinner value will be based on the

551 Rationale for Study Population
552 The target population will include subjects with uncontrolled T2D with HbA1c ≥9%-15%, 
553 treated with oral anti-diabetic agents and low dose basal insulin (TDD ≤50 units/d), in whose 
554 treatment intensification is recommended. Subjects should have been on oral anti-diabetic 
555 agents or basal insulin for at least 90 days (with stable doses of insulin, 10% of dose 
556 fluctuations are acceptable). These subjects need intensification of therapy, and should start 
557 basal insulin and progressively step-up to basal-bolus insulin per national guidelines. However, 
558 these patients may benefit more from a simpler regimen consisting of a single daily injection, 
559 with lower risk of hypoglycaemia and less weight gain, which could improve treatment 
560 adherence. IDegLira is an attractive therapeutic option for these patients for its potency, 
561 flexibility, and potential lower risk of hypoglycaemia and weight gain.
562
563 Visit Procedures
564 Figure 2 and Table 1 provides a description of procedures to be performed at each visit 
565 during the study period. Visits will be distributed as follows: initial/screening visit/CGM baseline 
566 insertion, (visit 1), 2 weeks of screening/run-in period, randomization visit (visit 2), 26-week 
567 treatment period (visits 4-18), and a follow-up safety visit after the end the 26- weeks treatment 
568 period (visit 19). Subjects will have contact with the study team via clinic visits or phone 
569 contacts for a total of 9 clinic visits and 9 telephone contacts. If subjects cannot participate in a 
570 scheduled visit (+/- 3 days), the investigators will arrange for an urgent (as soon as possible) 
571 visit. During follow-up, we will collect the following data (as described in Table 1): glycemic 
572 data, hypoglycemia events, drug compliance, protocol adherence, body measurements, and 
573 adverse events.
574
575 Definitions:
576 CGM Hypoglycemia: CGM glucose levels < 70, < 54, < 40 mg/dl, with a duration at least 
577 15 minutes by CGM. The end of the event will be when glucose is > 70 mg/dl for 15 
578 minutes. A prolonged hypoglycemic event will be defined as CGM levels < 54 mg/dl for 
579 120 minutes or more”.52 
580 We will only analyze CGM data collected after the first 24 hours from insertion. Patients 
581 should have worn the CGM for at least > 4 days. 
582 Documented symptomatic hypoglycemia, defined as an event with typical symptoms of 
Version 3.2 10.12.21 Page. 19583 hypoglycemia confirmed by SMBG or CGM (< 70 mg/dL and < 54 mg/dL) that occurs at 
584 any time of the day
585 Incidence of asymptomatic hypoglycemia, defined as no typical symptoms reported by 
586 the subject but detected by SMBG or CGM (<70 mg/dL and < 54 mg/dL)
587 Incidence of severe hypoglycemia, defined as severe cognitive impairment requiring 
588 assistance from another person
589 Incidence of nocturnal symptomatic hypoglycemia, defined as an event with typical 
590 symptoms of hypoglycemia confirmed by SMBG or CGM < 70 mg/dL and < 54 mg/dL 
591 that occurs between 00:00 and 05:59 hrs
592 Incidence of nocturnal asymptomatic hypoglycemia, defined as no typical symptoms 
593 reported by the subject but detected by SMBG or CGM (<70 mg/dL and < 54 mg/dL) 
594 between 00:00 and 05:59 hrs
595 Confirmed hypoglycaemia includes: severe hypoglycemia and episodes with or without 
596 symptoms with biochemical confirmation of glucose < 54 mg/dL.
597 Relative hypoglycemia includes: typical symptoms but with glucose > 70 mg/dL
598
599
600 Body measurements (Visits V1, V2, V6, V10, V12, V13, V15, V17)
601
602 Body weight: Body weight should be measured in kilogram or pound, without shoes and only 
603 wearing light clothing.
604 Height: Height (without shoes) should be measured in centimeters or inches and recorded 
605 without decimals.
606 Waist and hip circumference: The waist circumference is defined as the minimal abdominal 
607 circumference located midway between the lower rib margin and the iliac crest. The hip 
608 circumference is defined as the widest circumference around the buttocks.  Three consecutive 
609 measurements of waist and hip circumference should be taken and recorded.  Mean values will 
610 be used for result analysis. The waist and hip circumferences will be measured to the nearest
611 1.5 cm (0.2 inches) using a non-stretchable measuring tape.
612 The subject should be measured in a standing position with an empty bladder and wearing light 
613 clothing with accessible waist and hip. The tape should touch skin, but not compress soft tissue 
614 and twist in tape should be avoided. The subject should be asked to breathe normally and the 
615 measurement should be taken when the subject is breathing out gently.
616 Body Mass Index (BMI): BMI will be calculated by the formula Body weight 
617 (Kg)/m2.Screening Visit: (visit 1, week -2)
618 Approximately 2 weeks prior to starting study medications, all potential study subjects will be 
Version 3.2 10.12.21 Page. 20619 screened to check their eligibility. After providing the subjects with detailed information about the 
620 trial, subjects will sign the informed consent form and will be assigned a patient identification 
621 number.
622 During this visit, investigators will perform a comprehensive assessment, including: 
623 present and past medical history (concomitant illness), diabetes history (onset, prior 
624 complications, current and prior anti-diabetes medication’s duration, allergies, or intolerances), 
625 physical examination, height, weight, vital signs, laboratory assessment (HbA1c, chemistry, 
626 pregnancy test for women of child-bearing potential (WOCBP), documentation of current 
627 medications, and prior intolerances or allergies. Investigators will notify the primary care 
628 physician that the subjects have consented to participate in the study. In WOCBP, the 
629 contraceptive methods will be documented. 
630
631 After review of all inclusion and exclusion criteria, including laboratory results, patients 
632 who do not meet all the inclusion criteria at Visit 1 will be considered screen failures and will not 
633 be randomized to participate in the study. 
634
635 During this visit, the investigator will insert the CGM to obtain baseline information 
636 (before drug exposure). During this visit, patients will receive training on CGM use and reinforce 
637 SMBG diary collection. Trained personnel will proceed with sensor insertion. After that, the 
638 sensor will be activated, the CGM session will be started. 
639
640 Eligible patients will be trained on the use of the glucose meter to monitor their BG levels 
641 (i.e. 8-point SMBG). Patients will be given diabetes diaries and associated training to record all 
642 glucose levels, insulin doses, and episodes of hypoglycemia. Subcutaneous injections 
643 administration technique will be reviewed prior to randomization to ensure good technique. 
644 Reinforcement will be provided as needed during the follow-up visits. 
645
646 Patients will be instructed in performing glucose testing at home before meals, with a 
647 minimum of 2 out of the 4 pre-meal and/or bedtime glucose measurements per day. In addition, 
648 patients must perform an 8-point SMBG for at least 1 day prior to week 0, 12, 26, as follows:
649
650
651 Time-points for 8-point SMBG profile:
652
653 The blood glucose levels should be measured and recorded in the diary (including date, 
654 actual clock time and blood glucose value) at the following time points, always starting with 
Version 3.2 10.12.21 Page. 21655 measurement before breakfast. Subjects will be instructed to collect the SMBG on a day where 
656 the subject does not anticipate unusual strenuous exercise.
657 Before breakfast
658 90 min after the start of breakfast
659 Before lunch
660 90 min after the start of lunch
661 Before dinner
662 90 min after the start of dinner
663 At bedtime
664 In the middle of the night at 3 or 4 am
665 Subject will also be instructed to check and record BG when hypoglycemia is suspected. Values
666 < 70 mg/dl should trigger an intervention, as described below (safety section).
667
668 Instructions for Run-In Period (2 weeks):
669 The main purpose of this period is to ensure that patients can comply with 8-point SMBG, pen 
670 instructions and trial recommendations.
671 Oral antidiabetic agents will be continued at same dose until randomization visit. 
672 Metformin dose will be titrated up to 1000mg twice daily or to the maximum tolerated 
673 dose, unless contraindicated, per investigator’s discretion. 
674 Basal Insulin therapy [NPH, mixed insulin, or basal insulin (glargine U100, detemir)] at 
675 TDD ≤50 units will continue at same insulin dosage until randomization. Insulin can be 
676 initiated, or dose could be increased during run-in period in those subjects with severe 
677 hyperglycemia (BG>300 mg/dL) and/or glucotoxicity per investigator’s discretion, for 
678 subject’s safety reasons. 
679 Patients will be instructed in performing glucose testing at home before meals, with a 
680 minimum of 2 out of the 4 pre-meal and/or bedtime glucose measurements per day.
681 Patient not randomized in the trial will be considered screening failures, and no data will 
682 be collected since these patients will not receive study medication.
683
684
685
686 Preparation for Visit 2 (Randomization visit)
687 Patient will be instructed to complete the 8-point SMBG, and to titrate up metformin, 
688 unless contraindicated.
689 All patients will be instructed to provide daily glucose records. In addition, they will 
Version 3.2 10.12.21 Page. 22690 perform an 8-point SMBG done prior to Visit 3 (as described above).
691 Patients who complied with the 8-point glucose testing (up to 6 points) and fulfill the 
692 eligibility criteria at Visit 2 will be randomized to participate in the study.

754 CGM visits (insertion on weeks -2, 12, 26 and collection on week 0, 14, 27)
755 All enrolled participants will have a blinded/professional CGM study performed during 
756 week -2, 12, and 26 weeks of follow-up.
757 During this visit, participants will receive training on CGM use and reinforce SMBG diary 
758 collection. Trained personnel will proceed with sensor insertion, transmitter placement and 
759 hook-up. After that, the transmitter will be activated, the CGM session will be started.
760 After 7 days, subjects will remove the sensor and return to the scheduled visit. Transmitter 
761 will be connected to the computer for data downloading. CGM summary will be reviewed to 
762 determine the quality.
763 Sensor will be stored following standard precautions. Onsite visits will be allowed for upload of 
764 the study devices and face-to-face discussion about hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia 
Version 3.2 10.12.21 Page. 24765 episodes, insulin doses, AE/SAE evaluation, and replacement of study medication, if required. 
766 Trained personnel will input required clinical and demographic data into the sensor database 
767 software. Subjects will complete an 8-point SMBG for 1 day (as shown in Table 1) prior to clinic 
768 visit. Subjects will bring their glucose meter, CGM sensor (if applicable), BG diary, to each 
769 onsite visit.
770 Visit 17 (Week 26, end-of-study)
771 Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire Status (DTSQs) and TRIM-D survey
772 Blood sampling as indicated on page 12- schedule of events during the study period, 
773 including HbA1c assessment to determine efficacy of treatment

775 self-administration
776
777 Visit 18 (week 27, case sign-off)
778 This visit should occur at least one week after the last treatment visit
779 Since degludec has a prolonged duration of action, this visit will serve to monitor for 
780 adverse events.
781 Sensor removal (after 7 days).
782 During each visit, participants will have their insulin dose titrated to achieve a fasting 
783 glucose 70-100 mg/dL as detailed in the insulin titration algorithm. Once the fasting glucose 3- 
784 day average is <100 mg/dL, insulin doses will be kept constant, unless the participant 
785 experiences recurrent or severe hyperglycemia.

790 Assessments for Efficacy
791 The primary outcome of efficacy will be determined by change of HbA1c from baseline 
792 a f t e r  2 6  w e e k s  o f  t r e a t m e n t . HbA1c will be measured by the clinical laboratory of 
793 Grady Memorial Hospital and Emory University, a NGSP-certified laboratory. Subjects will 
794 complete an 8-point SMBG for at least 1 day before the CGM visits. We will also compare the 
795 time in target range (70-180) as detected by CGM, allowing us to assess glycemic control for > 7 
796 days with frequent testing (CGM and POC BG). We will compare the rate of “responders”, 
797 defined as patients HbA1c
798 <7.0% and no hypoglycemia at week 26.
799
800 Assessments for Safety
801 The safety endpoint of the study will be incidence of hypoglycaemia, as measured by the 
Version 3.2 10.12.21 Page. 25802 current standard-of-care of POC monitoring. Subjects will complete an 8-point POC BG log 
803 before weeks -1, 12, 26. In addition, we will perform blinded/professional CGM studies for 7 
804 days, during week -1, 12, and 26. CGM will allow better detection of hypoglycemic events, 
805 particularly asymptomatic and nocturnal hypoglycemia, usually not detected by POC monitoring. 
806 It will also provide critical information on time in glycemic range and glycemic variability. We will 
807 also compare differences in glycemic variability, by SD, %CV and MAGE. GV will be calculated 
808 by mean daily standard deviation (SD) of glucose values in absolute terms, and as a percentage 
809 of variance from the overall mean (%CV). These are measures of dispersion of glucose values 
810 around a measure of central tendency, which represents the overall glucose excursion during 
811 the study. We will also analyze GV by mean amplitude of glycemic excursion (MAGE), which 
812 represents the average of all BG excursions (up or down), with a magnitude of > 1 standard 
813 deviation of all BG measures47.
814
815 Potential Risks to the Subjects:
816 Hypoglycemia. It is possible that following the proposed protocol, subjects receiving IDegLira 
817 or Basal-bolus may develop hypoglycemia, as defined above.
818 Gastrointestinal side effects, including nausea and vomiting are more common in patients 
819 treated with liraglutide compared to placebo. The frequency of nausea and vomiting is reported 
820 in up to 5-15% patients receiving IDegLira. The number of adverse events will be collected at 
821 each telephone contact or clinic visit. There have been few reported events of acute 
822 pancreatitis. Subjects should be informed of the characteristic symptoms of acute pancreatitis: 
823 persistent, severe abdominal pain. If pancreatitis is suspected, Degludec-liraglutide should be 
824 discontinued. If the investigator suspects acute pancreatitis, all suspected drugs should be 
825 discontinued until confirmatory test have been conducted and appropriate treatment should be 
826 initiated. Subjects diagnosed with acute pancreatitis (as a minimum 2 of 3: characteristic 
827 abdominal pain, amylase and/or lipase >3xUNR or characteristic findings on CT scan/ MRI 
828 should be withdrawn from the study. In a cardiovascular outcomes trial (LEADER trial) 3.1% of 
829 patients treated with liraglutide, versus 1.9% of placebo treated patients reported an acute 
830 event of gallbladder disease, such as cholelithiasis or cholecystitis. The majority of events 
831 required hospitalization or cholecystectomy. If cholelithiasis is suspected, gallbladder studies 
832 and appropriate clinical follow-up will be indicated.
833
834 Protection against Risks:
835 We will follow safeguards to minimize the risk to our subjects: a) we will carefully monitor 
836 response to medical treatment every 1-2 weeks by telephone contact and every 1-2 months 
Version 3.2 10.12.21 Page. 26837 during clinic visits, b) women of reproductive age who are sexually active will undergo a urine 
838 pregnancy tests prior to participation in the study and in-person visits as deemed by the 
839 investigator, c) female subjects who are pregnant, breast-feeding, or not willing to use 
840 appropriate contraception at time of enrollment will not be included in the study, d) patients with 
841 significant comorbidities such as chronic kidney disease greater than stage III, liver cirrhosis, 
842 gastroparesis, and pancreatic disorders will be excluded from the study. Hypoglycemia: Patients 
843 will receive diabetes education and will be instructed on hypoglycemia sign/symptoms and 
844 treatment. Patients will be asked to call the diabetes center and/or PCP in the event of 
845 hypoglycemia. If a patient develops hypoglycemia, the dose of basal insulin will be reduced (see 
846 treatment algorithm). Gastrointestinal side effects including nausea and vomiting may be 
847 expected, more commonly in patients treated with liraglutide. In subjects with suspected acute 
848 pancreatitis liraglutide and other potentially suspect medicinal products should be discontinued 
849 until confirmatory tests have been conducted and appropriate treatment initiated.
850
851 Other Assessments
852 We will assess patient satisfaction by using the DTSQs at baseline and the DTSQc at the end- 
853 of-study, as recommended by Health Psychology Research.
854 For treatment satisfaction , subjects’ responses to questions 1, 7 and 8 of the DTSQc will be 
855 used. A comparison of the score on the DTSQs from week 0 to week 24, as well as using the 
856 score on the other questions of the DTSQc, which would overcome the ceiling limitation of using 
857 the DTSQs by itself49. The Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire Status (DTSQs) form 
858 will be administered at weeks 0, 12 and the DTSQc will be administered at week 26. The 
859 amplitude of the score on the DTSQc gives the degree of change in satisfaction, while the 
860 direction (positive or negative) will provide guidance on the preference of one treatment regimen 
861 over the other one.
862 For quality of life, we will use the “Treatment-related impact measures for diabetes” (TRIM-D)” 
863 in order to determine the impact of the type of therapy on this outcome.  Subjects will be given 
864 the questionnaire at baseline, and weeks 12 and 26 to assess their quality of life and any 
865 potential impact of the treatment regimen 50.
866 Subject Compliance
867 Subject compliance will be assessed by monitoring of drug accountability. Subjects will be 
868 encouraged at every visit to adhere to the study medications and follow-up schedule. Unused 
869 trial medications will be compared with dispensed amount at each corresponding visit. If 
870 discrepancies are noted, the subject will be asked.
Version 3.2 10.12.21 Page. 27871
872 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS:
873 Sample Size Calculation
874 The primary outcome is the change in HbA1c from baseline after 26-weeks of treatment.
875 The primary hypothesis is that HbA1c change is similar between the IDegLira group and the 
876 basal-bolus group. Given the data reported for the DUAL V study, we assume the HbA1c 
877 change from baseline has a standard deviation bounded above by 0.85 (%). We assume the 
878 margin of equivalence is 0.4 (%) and the true mean difference in the primary outcome is 0 (%). 
879 Given 57 subjects per study group, based on a one-sided, two-sample t-tests, we would achieve 
880 80% power to detect non-inferiority, with alpha (type-1 error) set as 0.05. Accounting for 20% 
881 attrition rate of 20%, we need to recruit 75 subjects per group (150 in total).
882
883 Statistical Methods
884 This is a randomized, open-label study. We will first compare the primary outcome (i. e. 
885 change in HbA1c from baseline to after 26 weeks of treatment) between the two study groups 
886 using nonparametric and parametric two-sample tests, such as Wilcoxon tests and t-tests. A 
887 logarithm transformation may be employed to make the data better conform to the normality 
888 assumption. We will apply standard variable selection and model checking procedures to decide 
889 the final model.
890 Secondary outcomes include various measurements (related to glycemic control, qualify 
891 of life, adverse effects, and etc.) collected at a single or multiple time points. For continuous 
892 outcomes measured a single time point (i.e. non-longitudinal outcome), we shall analyze them 
893 following the same strategy designed for the primary outcome. For discrete non-longitudinal 
894 outcome, we will use Chi-square (or Fisher’s Exact) tests to compare them between the two 
895 study groups. This will be followed by logistic regression or Poisson (or Negative Binomial) 
896 regression to assess other potential confounders.  We will perform appropriate model selection 
897 and diagnostic procedures to ensure adequate fit to the data. For outcomes measured at 
898 multiple time points (i.e. longitudinal outcome), we will first conduct cross-sectional analyses as 
899 planned for the non-longitudinal outcomes. Next we will perform repeated measures analyses 
900 that account for with-subject correlations in the longitudinal outcomes. We will analyze 
901 longitudinal continuous outcomes based on repeated measures ANOVA followed by repeated 
902 measures linear regression, and we will analyze longitudinal discrete outcomes by using
903 repeated measures generalized linear model (GLM). If the assumption of missing completely at 
904 random (MCAR) is reasonable, we shall handle missing data by excluding them from the cross- 
Version 3.2 10.12.21 Page. 28905 sectional and the longitudinal data analyses. When MCAR assumption is questionable, we will 
906 assume missing values are missing at random and deal with them by the standard multiple 
907 imputation methods. We plan to conduct statistical analyses using SAS 9.4.
908
909 Interim Analysis
910
911 We plan to perform interim analysis on the primary safety endpoint every 6 months. The 
912 trial will be stopped if there is evidence beyond a reasonable doubt of a difference in the rate of 
913 death (two-sided alpha level, <0.01) between the treatment groups. In addition, the trial will be 
914 stopped if the rate of severe hypoglycemic events (BG <40 mg/dl) in either group is > 40%.

924 treatment of diabetes and comorbid conditions, body weight, BMI. During follow-up visits, data 
925 from SMBG, laboratory and/or CGM will be also collected. Data on adverse events will also be 
926 collected and enter into the database. Presentation of the study results at regional or scientific 
927 meetings or in publications will not identify subjects.  Access to research and confidential  
928 records will be limited to clinical investigators, research coordinators, and the IRB at Emory 
929 University.

934 regarding the study and, if interested, a member of the research staff using inclusion/exclusion 
935 criteria delineated elsewhere in the protocol will enroll patients.  Informed consent will be 
936 obtained before any trial related procedures including screening procedures. The consent form,
937 potential risks and benefits, and the rights of research participants will be explained to the 
938 participant by the investigators or research coordinator. Individuals will be asked if they have 
939 questions, and a member of the research staff will answer questions.  The principal investigator 
Version 3.2 10.12.21 Page. 29940 will also be available at all times to answer questions that participants may have during the 
941 consent procedure or during the time a participant is enrolled in the study.  The consent form 
942 will be completed in accordance with the IRB guidelines of Emory University.  A signed copy of 
943 the consent form will be provided to the participant and a copy will be placed in the file that is 
944 maintained for each participant in the study office.
945 Informed consent will follow the procedure of Emory University Institutional Review 
946 Board.  Every potential participant will be informed in writing and verbally with the important and 
947 key points of the study.   One of the investigators or research coordinators will obtain an 
948 informed consent prior to inclusion of a patient into the study.
949 The study will be conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and will be 
950 conducted in accordance with the ICH GCP guidelines. The sponsor-investigator will comply 
951 with all applicable regulatory and legal requirements, ICH GCP guidelines and the Declaration

Version 3.2 10.12.21 Page. 321040 Definitions
1041 Adverse Event (AE):
1042 An AE is any undesirable medical event occurring to a subject in a clinical trial, whether 
1043 or not related to the trial product(s). This includes events reported from the first trial related 
1044 activity after the subject has signed the informed consent and until post treatment follow-up 
1045 period as defined in the protocol. 
1046 Adverse Reaction (AR)
1047 An AR is an adverse event for which the causal relationship between the product and the 
1048 adverse event is suspected. 
1049 The following should not be recorded as AEs, if recorded as medical history/concomitant illness 
1050 on the CRF at screening:
1051 • Pre-planned procedure, unless the condition for which the procedure was planned has 
1052 worsened from the first trial related activity after the subject has signed the informed consent
1053 • Pre-existing conditions found as a result of screening procedures
1054
1055
1056 Clinical Laboratory Adverse Event:
1057 A clinical laboratory AE is any clinical laboratory abnormality regarded as clinically 
1058 significant i.e. an abnormality that suggests a disease and/or organ toxicity and is of a severity, 
1059 which requires active management, (i.e. change of dose, discontinuation of trial product, more 
1060 frequent follow-up or diagnostic investigation).
1061
1062 Serious Adverse Event (SAE):
1063 A serious AE is an experience that at any dose results in any of the following:
1064 • Death
1065 • A life-threatening* experience
1066 • In-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization
1067 • A persistent or significant disability/incapacity
1068 • A congenital anomaly/birth defect
1069 • Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening*, or require 
1070 hospitalization may be considered an SAE when, based upon appropriate medical judgement, 
1071 they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one 
1072 of the outcomes listed in this definition
1073 • Suspicion of transmission of infectious agents
Version 3.2 10.12.21 Page. 331074 *The term life-threatening in the definition of SAE refers to an event in which the subject was at 
1075 risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event which hypothetically might 
1076 have caused death if it was more severe.
1077
1078 Serious Adverse Drug Reaction (SADR):
1079 An adverse drug reaction is an adverse event (AE) for which a causal relationship to the 
1080 trial product is at least possible i.e. causal relationship is conceivable and cannot be dismissed. 
1081 Serious adverse reaction (SAR): Adverse event which fulfils both the criteria for a Serious 
1082 Adverse Event and the criteria for an Adverse Reaction.
1083
1084
1085
1086 Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction (SUSAR):
1087 An SAE which is unexpected and regarded as possibly or probably related to the 
1088 trial/study product by the investigator.
1089
1090 Medical Events of Special Interest (MESI): A MESI is (1) a medication error (e.g. wrong drug 
1091 administration or wrong route of administration) or (2) a suspected transmission of an infectious 
1092 agent via the product
1093
1094 Non-Serious Adverse Event:
1095 A non-serious AE is any AE which does not fulfil the definition of an SAE.
1096
1097
1098 Severity Assessment Definitions:
1099 • Mild: Transient symptoms, no interference with the subject’s daily activities
1100 • Moderate: Marked symptoms, moderate interference with the subject’s daily activities
1101 • Severe: Considerable interference with the subject’s daily activities, unacceptable
1102
1103
1104 Relationship to study medication Assessment Definitions:
1105 • Probable: Good reasons and sufficient documentation to assume a causal relationship
1106 • Possible: A causal relationship is conceivable and cannot be dismissed
1107 • Unlikely: The event is most likely related to an ethology other than the trial product
1108
1109
1110 The US PI, will be used to evaluate all unexpected events and adverse reactions.

1112
Version 3.2 10.12.21 Page. 341113 Outcome Categories and Definitions:
1114 • Recovered: Fully recovered or by medical or surgical treatment the condition has returned to 
1115 the level observed at the first trial related activity after the subject signed the informed consent
1116 • Recovering: The condition is improving and the subject is expected to recover from the event. 
1117 This term should only be used when the subject has completed the trial
1118 • Recovered with sequelae: As a result of the AE, the subject suffered persistent and 
1119 significant disability/incapacity (e.g. became blind, deaf, paralyzed). Any AE recovered with 
1120 sequelae should be rated as an SAE
1121 • Not recovered
1122 • Fatal
1123 • Unknown
1124
1125 Collection, Recording and Reporting of Adverse Events
1126 All events meeting the definition of an adverse event must be collected and reported 
1127 from the first trial related activity after the subject has signed the informed consent and until the 
1128 end of the posttreatment follow-up period as stated in the protocol.
1129
1130 Follow-up of Adverse Events
1131 During and following a subject’s participation in a clinical trial, the investigator will provide 
1132 adequate medical care to the study subject for any study-related adverse events, including 
1133 clinically significant laboratory values related to the study, regardless of their insurance status.
1134 All adverse events classified as serious or severe or possibly/probably related to the trial 
1135 product must be followed until the subject has recovered and all queries have been resolved.
1136 For cases of chronic conditions follow-up until the outcome category is “recovered” is not 
1137 required, as these cases can be closed with an outcome of “recovering” or “not recovered”.
1138 All other adverse events must be followed until the outcome of the event is “recovering” (for 
1139 chronic conditions), or “recovered” or until the end of the post-treatment follow-up stated in the 
1140 protocol, whichever comes first, and until all queries related to these AEs have been resolved.
1141
1142 Pregnancy
1143 Subjects will be instructed to notify the sponsor-investigator immediately if they become 
1144 pregnant.
1145 The investigator will report to Novo Nordisk any pregnancy occurring during the trial 
1146 period. Reporting of pregnancy by investigator should occur within the same timelines described 
Version 3.2 10.12.21 Page. 351147 above for reporting of Adverse Events.
1148 Pregnancy complications should be recorded as adverse event(s). If the infant has a 
1149 congenital anomaly/birth defect this must be reported and followed up as a serious adverse 
1150 event.
1151
1152 Precautions/Over-dosage
1153 We will follow safeguards to minimize the risk to our subjects: a) we will carefully monitor 
1154 capillary blood glucose and reported symptoms. To minimize significant clinical events, we will 
1155 exclude patients with history of significant liver, renal or cardiac failure in this study.
1156
1157 Hypoglycemia can occur during the treatment with insulin. Hypoglycemia will be treated 
1158 accordingly to the best local practices, and insulin will be adjusted as per a predefined 
1159 algorithm. Subjects will be instructed to not exceed the maximum dose of IDegLira of 50 
1160 steps. Subjects will be instructed to maintain good hydration, and to report the presence of 
1161 severe nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea. Insulin doses will be adjusted for hypoglycemic values.
1162
1163
1164 LIABILITY AND SUBJECT INSURANCE:
1165 No additional cost to patients or to the institution will be incurred for research purposes.
1166 Patients will not be billed for the laboratory work or any test that is being done only for study 
1167 purposes. Novo Nordisk will provide IDegLira, Degludec and Aspart at no cost to 
1168 participants. Patients will be responsible for the cost of their usual ongoing medical care, 
1169 including procedures (glucose meter supplies) and/or non-study medications that your 
1170 doctor requires as part of your usual medical care.
1171 During and following a subject’s participation in a clinical trial, the investigator and 
1172 institution will provide adequate medical care to the study subject for any study-related adverse 
1173 events, including clinically significant laboratory values related to the study at patient own cost, 
1174 regardless of their insurance status. Financial compensation for such things as lost wages, 
1175 disability or discomfort due to an injury related to the study is not available.
1176 The sponsor-investigator will be responsible for the conduct of the study and that the 
1177 sponsor-investigator agrees to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Novo Nordisk, any of its 
1178 parent companies, affiliates, or subsidiaries, and their respective officers, directors, employees, 
1179 agents, representatives, distributors, salespersons, customers, licensees, and end-users from
1180 and against any claim, suit, demand, loss, damage, expense or liability imposed by any third 
1181 party arising from or related to: (a) any breach of sponsor-investigator's obligations or 
Version 3.2 10.12.21 Page. 361182 representations; or (b) sponsor-investigator’s negligent or grossly negligent use or willful misuse 
1183 of the study drug, the results, or services derived therefrom. This indemnification shall not apply 
1184 in the event and to the extent that a court of competent jurisdiction or a duly appointed arbiter 
1185 determines that such losses or liability arose as a result of Novo Nordisk’s gross negligence, 
1186 intentional misconduct, or material breach of its responsibilities.
1187
1188 PREMATURE TERMINATION OF STUDY:
1189 The investigator may decide to stop prematurely the trial. In this case, the investigator 
1190 will notify the subjects promptly and ensure appropriate follow up. The investigator will also 
1191 notify the IRB and local regulatory authorities.
1192
1193 PUBLICATION PLAN:
1194 We anticipate completion of the study in Dec 2019.  Data will be analyzed between 
1195 October and December 2019. One abstract will be submitted to the 2020 American Diabetes 
1196 Association meeting and manuscript(s) will be submitted during the first six months of 2020. 
1197 The investigator will register the study with a publicly assessable database, such as 
1198 clinicaltrials.gov.

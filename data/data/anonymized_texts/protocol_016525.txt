 Introduction  
You are being asked to be in a medical research study. This form is designed to tell you everything you need to think about before you decide to consent (agree) to be in the study or not to be in the study.  It is entirely your choice.  If you 
decide to take part, you can change your mind later on and withdraw from the research study.  The decision to join or 
not join the research study will not cause you to lose any medical benefits.  If you decide not to take part in this study, your doctor will  continue to treat you.  
 
Before making your decision:  
• Please carefully read this form or have it read to you  
• Please listen to the study doctor or study staff explain the study to you  
• Please ask questions about anything that is not clear  
 You can take a co py of this consent form, to keep. Feel free to take your time thinking about whether you would like to 
participate. You may wish to discuss your decision with family or friends. Do not sign this consent form unless you have had a chance to ask questions and get answers that make sense to you.  By signing this form you will not give up any legal rights.  
 A description of this clinical trial will be available on www.ClinicalTrials.gov, as required by U.S. law. This website will not 
include information that ca n identify you. At most the website will include a summary of the results. You may search this 
website at any time.  
 Study Overview  
You are being asked to volunteer for a research study on how HIV -infection and HIV medicines can affect the human 
skeleton.  Other studies have shown that HIV -infection and HIV medicines (antiretroviral pills or HAART) can cause bone 
loss. This can lead to osteoporosis --- a condition that makes bone fragile (weak) and fracture easily.  This study will look 
at how HIV virus and  HIV medicines affect blood proteins that control bone strength. The study will also examine 
whether bone loss in this setting can be prevented by giving other medicines that protect the skeleton. This medicine is called Reclast® (zoledronic acid). This me dicine is not approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in 
people with normal bone. However, the FDA has approved the use of this medicine for this study (IND # 108645). If we can understand how to protect the skeleton from the side effect  of HIV medicines, we may avoid premature fracture in 
some patients receiving HAART.    You are being invited to take part because you are HIV -infected and have not received HIV medicines (HAART) in the 
past, so you might be eligible to take part in this s tudy.

   Individuals who volunteer to take part in this study will undergo the following;  
• Thorough medical evaluations during study visits  
• Begin treatment for HIV -infection with HAART  
• Have a 50:50 chance of receive one dose of bone protection medicine or its placebo before starting HAART  
• Blood draw for proteins and other measurements  
• Total body DXA scan (DXA scan is a special type of X -ray that measures bone density).    
•  
If you decide to take part in the study, it should be because you really want to volunteer.  You will not lose any benefits 
or rights you would normally have if you choose not to volunteer.  You can stop at any time during the study.  If you stop the study, you will still keep the benefits and rights you had before volunteering.  If you decide not to take part in this study, your decision will have no effect on the quality of medical care you receive.  If you volunteer to take part in this study, you will be one of 94 people to do so.

   • 3 tubes (1tablespoon full) of blood will be collected for routine lab tests required as part of standard 
medical care for your condition at 2, 12, 24, 36, 48, 72, 96, 120, and 14 4. 
• 87 ml of blood (9 tablespoon full) will be collected for study tests at each visit.  
• You will fill a brief questionnaire to assess adherence to study medications.  
• You will bring your HIV medication bottles for pill counts.  
• Each visit should last for abou t one hour  (60 minutes).   
• At weeks 12, 24, 48, 96, and 144 you will be sent to Emory University Hospital Radiology for follow up DXA -scans. 
• If during any of these visits, your lab tests show your HIV is not adequately suppressed, you may be asked to retur n within 2 weeks for additional blood tests.  
 
Your samples will be stored at the lab.  This lab will keep your samples safe and secure for testing during the study.  No one will be able to tell that these samples came from you.  The samples stored at this lab will not have any data written 
on them that could identify you.  They will not have records stored with them that could identify you.  These samples will only be used for research related to this study.  Your specimens will only be kept until the study  ends. After the 
study ends they will be destroyed.   
 If you agree, the researchers may collect an additional tablespoon (10 cc) of blood sample  for storage during this study. 
This will occur during the entry visit. Also, if you agree, the research may st ore leftover samples (blood or body fluid) for 
additional tests.   These additional samples may be used as a source of DNA for genetic testing that is not yet planned but may be done at a later date. This testing may include studies of HIV, studies of othe r diseases that affect people with HIV, studies of your 
cells, proteins, and other chemicals in your body, and studies of your DNA.   
If you allow us to do additional tests on your specimens, these specimens will be kept confidential. They will be stored i n 
a building that is secure.  They will not be stored together with information that could let someone know that they came 
from you.  Your specimens will be labeled with a unique code; your name will not be written on any specimens.   
  Risks and Discomfor ts  
I.V. Blood Draw Risk  
Blood will be drawn from your veins during the study.  The risks associated with vein punctures are uncommon and they include  
• Small blood clots in a vein, which can be painful, and  
• Infection at the site of needle puncture  
• Pain, bruising, soreness, and reaction to tapes at the site of needle insertion  
• Some people may experience a fainting spell with needle puncture  
 These risks occur only on rare occasions.  
 Low vitamin D and Blood Calcium Levels : 
Low blood calcium and vitamin D levels are common particularly among individuals with HIV -infection. Therefore, your 
blood levels of calcium and vitamin D will be checked at the beginning and regularly during the study. If one or both of them is low, study investigators will recommend that you start taking calcium and/or vitamin D supplements.

   Risk of DXA -scan:  
This research study involves exposure to radiation from x -rays from DXA procedures.   This procedure is routinely used 
for medical purposes. This radiation dose may not be necessary for your medical care and may occur only as a result of 
your participation in this study. The radiation dose that you will receive is equal to or less than the natural 
environmental radiation the average person receives in the United States annually.   The principal risk associated with a 
radiation dose is the possibility of developing a radiation -induced cancer later in life.   The risk from radiation exposure of 
this magnitude is considered to be negligible when compared to everyday risks.   
 
Women who may be pregnant should not participate in this study because of possible effects of radiation exposure on 
their unborn child. There are currently no studies that show an increase in the risk of genetic mutation in the next generation of offspring.  
  HIV Medications (Antiretroviral Therapy):  
You will be receiving HIV medicines (HAART) as part of routine care for your HIV -infection. Like any other medication, 
there are side effects associated with HIV medicines. You will be carefully monitored for these side  effects by your 
primary care provider and the study personnel.  The risks associated with these medications are listed below.  
 Immune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome (IRIS) : On rare occasion in some people with advanced HIV infection, 
signs and sympt oms of inflammation from other infections may occur soon after anti -HIV treatment is started.    
 The use of potent anti -HIV drug combinations may be associated with an abnormal placement of body fat and wasting. 
This is however infrequent.  Some of the bo dy changes include:  
• Increase in fat around the waist and stomach area  
• Increase in fat on the back of the neck  
• Thinning of the face, legs, and arms  
• Breast enlargement 
 Risks with the Use of Nucleoside Analogues (tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and emtricitabi ne are nucleoside analogues)  
 Lactic acidosis (elevated lactic acid levels in the blood) and severe hepatomegaly (enlarged liver) with steatosis (fatty liver) that may result in liver failure, other complications or death have been reported with the use of  antiretroviral 
nucleoside analogues alone or in combination. The liver complications and death have been seen more often in women on these drug regimens. Some nonspecific symptoms that might indicate lactic acidosis include: unexplained weight loss, stoma ch discomfort, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, cramps, muscle pain, weakness, dizziness, and shortness of breath. This 
side effect is rare.    Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate (Tenofovir DF, TDF, VIREAD®)  
Gilead Sciences, Inc.  
 
The following side effects have been  associated with the use of tenofovir (they are rare to infrequent):  
• Upset stomach, vomiting, gas, loose or watery stools   
• Generalized weakness  
• Dizziness  
• Depression  
• Headache  
• Abdominal pain

 NOTE:  If you are infected with both hepatitis B and HIV, you  should be aware that your liver function tests may 
increase, and symptoms associated with hepatitis (an acute inflammation of the liver) may worsen if tenofovir is stopped.   
    
NOTE: Because there is only a small amount of information on tenofovir in pr egnant women, tenofovir should be used 
during pregnancy only if clearly needed.

         pancreatit is, you may have one or more of the following: stomach pain, nausea, and  
      vomiting.  
• Abnormal heart rhythm and electrocardiogram (EKG) changes. If you develop abnormal  
      heart rhythm you may experience lightheadedness, fainting spells or an abnormal heart beat.  
 Reclast® (Zoledronic acid) : 
Reclast is a FDA approved drug for the treatment of osteoporosis (weak bone). Recast on rare occasions may cause serious side effects such as:  
• Low vitamin D and Blood Calcium Levels : 
Low blood calcium and vitamin D levels are common particularly among individuals with HIV -infection. The use 
of reclast may further lower the blood levels of these tests. Symptoms may include numbness or tingling feeling (especially around the mouth) or muscle spasms. Therefore, yo ur blood levels of calcium and vitamin D will be 
checked at the beginning and regularly during the study. If one or both of them is low, study investigators will recommend that you start taking calcium and/or vitamin D supplements.    
• Kidney Problems : 
Bloo d tests to check your kidneys will be performed regularly during the study.  
• Jaw-bone Problems (Osteonecrosis of the jaw):  
Jaw-bone problem may occur in some people and include infection, slower healing after teeth are pulled.  
• Severe muscle and joint pain:  
Below are listed side effects (adverse events) that were reported by 2% or more of patients with osteopenia (thin bone) treated with reclast 5 mg i.v. once per year. These side effects were more common in patients treated with reclast than those treated w ith placebo (saline solution).  
 Acute Phase Reaction  
The signs and symptoms of acute phase reaction following reclast infusion including,  
Fever  
Myalgia (muscle aches)  
Flu-like symptoms  
Headache  
Arthralgia  
These symptoms occurred within the first 3 days following the dose of reclast and usually resolved within 3 days of onset but resolution could take up to 7- 14 days.  
 Digestive  
Nausea (sick at the stomach)  
Constipation  
Diarrhea  
Dyspepsia (heart burn)  
Abdominal discomfort

 New Information  
It is possible that the researchers will learn something new during the study about the risks of being in it.  If this 
happens, they will tell you about it. Then you can decide if you want to continue to be in this study or not.  You may be asked to sign a new consent form that includes the new information if you decide to stay in the study.  
 Benefits   
Taking part in this study may not help you directly, but it will help us learn more about how HIV and HAART associated bone loss occur and how it can be prevented.  This knowledge may help other people in the future.  In addition, you may find out about a serious bone condition that you did not know you had.  
 Compensation  
We consider your participation in this study entirely voluntary, and appreciate your time and commitment to research.  As co mpensation for your time, inconvenience, and to assist with the cost of transportation to the Ponce Clinic, you will 
be paid fifty dollars ($50)for each completed study visit, including the screening, entry and the 13 follow up study visit . If 
you have to return to the clinic for a repeat procedure from a previous visit, you will receive $25. For those who take 
public transportation, participants will receive a two -way MARTA Pass for study visits involving a DEXA and  a one-way 
MARTA pass  for all other study  visits. If you do not finish the study, you will be paid for the visits you have completed.  
You will not be responsible for the costs of any tests directly related to this study.   
 Confidentiality

   Research Protections, the Emory Institutional Review Board, the Emory Office of Research Compliance, the Grady 
Research Oversight Committee, and the Office for Clinical Research .   
 There is a Certificate of Confidenti ality for this Study:  
 We will do everything we can to keep others from learning about your participation in the research. To further help protect your privacy, the investigators have obtained a Confidentiality Certificate.  
 What the Certificate of Confid entiality protects:   
The National Institutes of Health has given this study a Certificate of Confidentiality.  Emory or Grady Health System  
would rely on it to not give out study information that identifies you.  For example, if Emory or Grady received a 
subpoena for study records that identify you, we would say no.  The Certificate gives Emory or Grady Health System  
legal backup to say no.  It covers information about you that could harm your image or finances.  It also covers information about you that co uld harm your chances at a job or getting insurance.  
 What the Certificate of Confidentiality does not protect:    
The Certificate does not prevent you or someone other than you from disclosing your information. The Certificate does not prevent Emory or Gra dy from making the following disclosures of information about you:  
• Information to state public health offices about certain infectious diseases  
• Information to law officials if child abuse has taken place  
• Information Emory or Grady gives to prevent immediat e harm to you or others  
• Information Emory or Grady gives to the study sponsor as part of the research  
 Research Information Will Go Into the Medical Record:  
If you are or have been an Emory or Grady Health System patient, you have an Emory or Grady Health System medical 
record.  If you are not and have never been an Emory or Grady Health System patient, you do not have one.  Please note that an Emory or Grady Health System medical record will be created if you have any services or procedures done by an 
Emor y or Grady Health System provider or facility for this study. Copies of the consent form and HIPAA patient form that 
you sign will be placed in your Emory Healthcare or Grady Health System medical record.  
 Emory or Grady Health System may create study info rmation about you that can help Emory Healthcare take care of 
you. For example, the results of study tests or procedures.  These study results will be placed in your Emory or Grady 
Health System medical record. Anyone who has access to your medical record will be able to have access to all the study information placed there. The confidentiality of the study information in your medical record will be protected by laws like the HIPAA Privacy Rule. On the other hand, some state and federal laws and rules may n ot protect the research 
information from disclosure.  
 Emory and Grady Health System do not control results from tests and procedures done at other places, so these results would not be placed in your Emory or Grady Health System medical record. They will n ot likely be available to Emory or 
Grady Health System to help take care of you. Emory and Grady Health System also do not have control over any other medical records that you may have with other healthcare providers. Emory and Grady Health System will not  send any 
test or procedure results from the study to these providers.  If you decide to be in this study, it is up to you to let them know.

   Attachment 1 of Consent Form  
Sample Storage and Future Testing  
 
Please carefully read the statements below and think about your choices. No matter what you decide, it will not affect 
your care.  
 
If you agree, additional and/or left over samples will be stored and may be used for further tests. Your stored samples will be labeled only with your study number, not your name.  Storage of leftover blood is not a requirement to take part in the  study and you may take back your approval for the storage of your leftover blood, at any time.  If you want your 
stored samples destroyed during the study or after you have finished the study, you should call the study doctor or nurse and ask that these s amples be destroyed.  These samples may be held for an indefinite length of time.  We cannot 
ensure that you will be told of the results of the research done on these samples. The information that is obtained from the analysis of your blood samples may be used scientifically.  The analysis of your blood samples may contribute to the 
creation of new diagnostic tests, or other uses that may be commercially valuable.  You will receive no financial benefits and may not receive any health -related benefits from s uch developments.  
 I agree to have any of my left over samples (blood or other body fluids) stored and used for additional research. This research will be done at a later date and may include genetic testing.

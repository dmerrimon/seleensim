MC1679 6  Amendment 1 
Version date: 21Nov2017  1.0 Background  
1.1 Thyroid Cancer Overview 
Thyroid cancer incidence is rising more rapidly than for any other cancer. Thyroid 
cancers include differentiated thyroid cancers (DTC, including papillary and follicular 
variant s), medullary thyroid cancer and a highly aggressive variant, undifferentiated or 
anaplastic t hyroid cancer (ATC; Figure 1 ) (Bible and Ryder 2016).  
 
ATC is perhaps the most aggressive human cancer . Historically, fewer than 20% survive 
1 year , median overall survival is ~5 months, and it is almost universally fatal (McIver, 
Hay et al. 2001; Goutsouliak and Hay 2005; Albores -Saavedra, Henson et al. 2007 ; 
Dandekar, Harmer et al. 2009; Bible, Suman et al. 2012; Mohebati, Dilorenzo et al. 
2014). Doxorubicin is the only FDA approved medication for this malignancy, but has poor efficacy  [~5% ORR in a randomized study ( Shimaoka, Schoenfeld et al. 1985)]. 
Multimodality therapy combining surgery, radiotherapy and cytotoxic chemotherapy appears to produce improved survival, but all ATC patients are ultimately expected to 
succumb to their disease, mostly from distant metastatic disease (Bible et al., unpublished data, see Section  1.2 and Section 1.5
 and Figure 5). More effecti ve therapies are sorely 
needed.  
1.2 Current treatment strategies for Anaplastic Thyroid cancer  
Treatment for ATC is an oncologic emergency  as tumor doubling time can sometimes 
only be in days. Treatment should be instituted expeditiously,  and requires input from an 
experienced multidisciplinary team , ideally undertaken at high volume centers . ATC is 
highly aggressive and is highly invasive into neighboring anatomical structures such as 
esophagus and trachea , and therefore represent an emer gent threat to airway and to 
esophagus, as well as to vessels and nerves.  
Figure 1 . Thyroid cancer molecular pathogenesis  
MC1679 7  Amendment 1 
Version date: 21Nov2017  Surgical resection is technically difficult  in almost all ATC cases. However, there is 
evidence from several retrospective studies that surgical resection may improve survival 
in AT C patients (De Cr evoisier, Baudin et al. 2004; Akaishi, Sugino et al. 2011; Sugitani, 
Hasegawa et al. 2014 ; Kwon, Kim et al. 2016) , and it has thus been our practice to aspire 
to resection if feasible. Due to morbidity, howe ver, our practice is generally not to 
undertake laryngectomy, and instead settle for an R1 resection in cases in which para-
laryngeal disease is prominent,  as radiotherapy is uniformly administered in our practice 
after surgery in patients who elect an aggressive approach to their disease.  This reflects a 
sense that the disease is often systemic and the goal is the rapid onset of chemotherapy 
and radiation therapy, which can be delayed by complex surgical wounds or wound 
complications.  
Radiation therapy is an integral part of the treatment for ATC, both in the setting  of 
curative intention and also as part of palliative treatment, even if best supportive care is 
otherwise elected . Multiple institutions over the years have reported their experience with 
multimodal therapy  (Aldinger, Samaan et al. 1978; De Crevoisier, Baudin et al. 2004; 
Bhatia, Rao et al. 2 010; Akaishi, Sugino et al. 2011; Foote, Molina et al. 2011 ; Mohebati, 
Dilorenzo et al. 2014 ). It is unclear if accelerated or hyperfractionated radiation therapy 
incrementally improves outcomes (Heron, Karimpour et al. 2002; Dandekar, Harmer et 
al. 2009), but it has often been demonstrated from retrospective studies that radiation 
dose of >40- 50 Gy is associated with better local control and overall survival ( Akaishi, 
Sugino et al. 2011). Acute and late toxic ity associated with radiation therapy for thyroid 
cancer includes painful mucositis requiring narcotic pain medications, thick secretions, 
altered taste, dehydration, malnutrition, laryngeal edema, cartilage necrosis, esophageal stenosis, xerostomia, and feeding tube dependence. Intensity modulated radia tion therapy  
may be able to lessen the incidence and severity of these toxicities through lowering the daily dose and total dose to the oral cavity, pharyngeal, laryngeal and esophageal mucosa 
and major and minor salivary glands. 
The m ost common 
chemotherapy 
regimens included 
in chemoradiation  
ATC studies 
included taxanes, 
doxorubicin 
and/or  platinum 
agents. Doxorubicin is the 
only FDA approved agent for 
the treatment of 
ATC and has been 
used with radiatio n 
sensitizing agents in multiple studies (Aldinger, Samaan 
et al. 1978; Kim 
and Leeper 1983 ; 
De Crevoisier, Baudin et al. 2004; Derbel, Limem et al. 2011; Foote, Molina et al. 2011; Sherman, Lim

MC1679 8  Amendment 1 
Version date: 21Nov2017  et al. 2011). Ain et al. demonstrated 53% ORR to paclitaxel in patients with persistent or 
metastatic ATC (Ain, Egorin et al. 2000) , but duration of benefit was short . In recent 
studies, docetaxel has been also used in chemoradiation protocols for ATC , and has 
shown some promising effic acy (Troch, Koperek et al. 2010; Foote, Molina et al. 2011; 
Onoda, Kashiwagi et al. 2013; Onoda, Sugitani et al. 2015; Seto, Sugitani et al. 2015). 
Nevertheless, t here is no defined standard of care chemotherapeutic agent or regimen  to 
be used with radiation therapy. Use of a combination of these agents or any of these 
agents alone is reasonable, with current data  favoring use of at least a taxane. 
1.3 Immune microenvironment of Anaplastic Thyroid Cancer  
Anaplastic thyroid cancers have a high expression of PD -1/PDL -1 (~70%), high 
mutational burden, ~45% rate of BRAF V600 mutation (which promotes a suppressive 
immune environment) and ~10% rate of microsatellite instability; in combination , all of 
these characteristics make ATC a prime target for immunotherapy.  
a. We have previously  shown that nearly half of ATC tumor volume is composed of 
tumor- associated monocytes/macrophages (TAMs ) (Figure 2 ) (Ryder, Ghossein et 
al. 2008; Ryder, Gild et al. 2013) . Pre-clinical data in thyroid cancer mouse models 
demonstrate that TAMs promote tumor initiation and de-differentiation. Additionally, 
TAMs have potent immunosuppressive effects, particularly through influencing 
increased expression of PD -L1/PD -L2.  
b. Data from human tissues demo nstrate  increased gene expression of PD-1 and/or PD-
L1 in aggressive thyroid cancers, including ATC (Figure 2) by RT_PCR.  
c. We have also demonstrated increased expression of PDL -1 by immunohistochemistry 
in approximately 80% of the human ATC samples available for testing. There was no 
PD-1 expression in these tumors as well as tumor stroma ( Figure 3 ). Observed 
increased PDL -1 expression was demonstrated  by others also ( Bastman, Serracino et 
al. 2016), providing the rationale in the form of enhanced target expression for  
proposed pembrolizumab studies.   
d. ATC shows high mutational burden with significant genetic alterations. In a recent study, ~70% of the ATC patients demonstrated P53 and TERT mutations ( Landa, 
Ibrahimpasic et al. 2016 ). In another study, similar findings were noted ( Kunstman, 
Juhlin et al. 2015). Interestingly, both studies also demonstrated ~10% incidence of microsatellite instability (MSI
high) in ATC (Kunstman, Juhlin et al. 2015; Landa, 
Ibrahimpasic et al. 2016 ). Both higher mutational burden and MSI high status have 
been shown predictive of response to anti- PD-1 therapy in other cancers ( Le, Uram et 
al. 2015; Rizvi, Hellmann et al. 2015 ). 
e. There is now  also promising evidence that focal radiation therapy of solid primary or 
metastatic foci of disease, when combined with immune modulating therapies, can

Version date: 21Nov2017  1.4 Pembrolizumab 
Cancer cells are known to have the ability to evade immunosurveillance through a variety 
of mechanisms, including: reduced expression of tumor antigens, downregulation of 
MHC class I and II molecules for reduced tumor antigen presentation, secretion of immunosuppressive cytokines such TGF-beta, recruitment or induction of 
immunosuppressive cells such as regulatory T cells (Treg) or myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSC), and overexpression of certain ligands (eg, PD -L1) that inhibit the host’s 
existing antitumor immunity( Tang, Wang et al. 2014 ). Recently, antibodies targeting the 
PD-1/PD -L1 or PD -L2 pathway have shown impressive and durable clinical benefit in 
melanoma, with promising activity emerging in multiple other solid tumors.  
The programmed dea th 1 (PD -1) pathway is a negative feedback system that represses 
Th1 cytotoxic immune responses that, if unregulated, can damage the host ( Nishimura, 
Nose et al. 1999 ; Nishimura, Okazaki et al. 2001; Chen 2004) . It is up -regulated in many 
tumors and in their surrounding microenvironment. Blockade of this pathway with 
antibodies to PD -1 or its ligands has led to remarkable clini cal responses in patients with 
many different types of cancer, including melanomas, non–small -cell lung cancer, renal 
cell carcinoma, bladder cancer, and Hodgkin’s lymphoma  (Brahmer, Tykodi et al. 2012; 
Topalian, Hodi et al. 2012; Hamid, Robert et al. 2013; Herbst, Soria et al. 2014; Powles, 
Eder et al. 2014; Topalian, Sznol et al. 2014; Ansell, Lesokhin et al. 2015 ). The 
expression of PD- 1 ligands (PD -L1 or PD -L2) on the surface of tumor cells or immune 
cells is an important —but not a definitive— predictive biomarker of response to PD-1 
blockade ( Herbst, Soria et al. 2014 ; Powles, Eder et al. 2014; Taube, Klein et al. 2014; 
Topalian, Sznol et al. 2014 ; Ansell, Lesokhin et al. 2015). 
Immunotherapeutic strategies aimed at overcoming immunotolerance and improving the activation of antitumor T cells represent a new promising therapeutic approach. Among 
them, pembrolizumab is a potent and highly selective humanized monoclonal ant ibody 
(mAb) of the IgG4/kappa isotype designed to directly block the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2. In a phase I study, 655 patients with advanced melanoma were treated with pembrolizumab in four treatment cohorts using one of three 
dose schedules (10 mg/kg every two weeks, 10 mg/kg every three weeks, or 2 mg/kg every three weeks). Approximately three- fourths of patients had received prior systemic 
therapies for metastatic disease, includi ng 52 percent who had received prior ipilimumab  
(Duad, Ribas et al. 2015) . The overall objective response rate using RECIST criteria and 
central review was 33%. OS at 12 months was 66% and 49% at 24 months. Median PFS 
was 4.4 months, and 35% of patients remained progression-free at 12 months. On 
multivariate analysis, there were no significant differences in outcomes between the three 
dose schedules. Although these studies suggested that PD- L1 positivity correlated with 
increased responsiveness, absence o f PD-L1 expression did not preclude a clinical 
response. Treatment -related  toxicities  were manageable; 83 percent of patients 
experienced one or more treatment -related adverse events. The most common toxicities 
were fatigue, pruritus, rash, diarrhea, and arthralgia (36%, 24%, 20%, 16%, and 16%, respectively). Overall 14% of patients experienced Grade 3 or 4 toxicit ies, the most 
common being fatigue (2%), and there were no treatment- related deaths. 
Two phase III studies, first with  ipilimumab -refractory advanced melanoma patients who 
were randomly assigned to pembrolizumab (2 mg/kg every three weeks), pembrolizumab 
(10 mg/kg every three weeks) or chemotherapy ( carboplatin  plus paclitaxel , paclitaxel 
alone, dacarbazine, or temozolomide per inst itutional standard) ( Ribas, Puzanov et al. 
2015); and second, where  pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg d oses were compared 
with ipilimumab  (Robert, Schachter et al. 2015 ) in ipilimumab -naïve patients; resulted in 
MC1679 11  Amendment 1 
Version date: 21Nov2017  US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of p embrolizumab at a dose of 
2 mg/kg every three weeks in September 2014.  
The safety and efficacy of pembrolizumab monotherapy was recently assessed in patients 
with advanced non- small -cell lung cancer (NSCLC)  (Garon, Rizvi et al. 2015 ). Common 
side effects attributed to pembrolizumab were fatigue, pruritus, and decreased appetite. 
Among all patients, ORR was 19.4%, and the median duration of response (DOR) was 12.5 months.  
Pembrolizumab has since been shown  to be efficacious in many solid tumors including, 
head and neck cancer. KEYNOTE -012, a phase 1b trial with recurrent and metastatic 
head and neck cancers, studied the role of single agent pembrolizumab. Only patients 
who were  PD-L1+ were enrolled , but later an expansion cohort allowed PD- L1− patients 
to enroll.
 One hundred and four patients were screened and 60 patients with PD- L1-
positive squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck were enrolled and treated: 23 (38%) were HPV -positive and 37 (62%) were HPV- negative. Overall response by central 
imaging review was 18% (eight of 45 patients; 95% CI 8–32) in all patients , and was 
25% (four of 16 patients; 7–52) in HPV -positive patients and 14% (four of 29 patients; 
4–32) in HPV -negative patients ( Seiwert, Burtness et al. 2016 ). Similar results were seen 
for efficacy in the expansion cohort. Another phase 2 study, K EYNOTE -055, enrolled 
recurrent and metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinom a patients who had failed 
platinum and cetuximab therapy. This study screened 228 patients and enrolled 172. Eighty -four percent of the patients had ≥2 lines of therapy and 41% were HPV-positive. 
Again, treatment was well tolerated, and 12% of patients demonstrated grade ≥3 adverse 
events. Overall response rate (ORR) was 22% in patients who had at least 6 months of 
follow up ( Bauml, Seiwert et al. 2016).

1.5 Multimodal treatment (Mayo  Clinic ) protocol for treatment of ATC 
As mentioned above, ATC is undifferentiated carcinoma of the thyroid gland that is rare (<2% of all thyroid cancers), has historically dire prognosis, and is almost universally 
fatal (Albores -Saavedra, Henson et al. 2007; Bible and Ryder 2016), leading to a 
disproportionately high fraction of thyroid cancer -related d eaths  (Are and Shaha 2006; 
Neff, Farrar et al. 2008 ). Randomized clinical trials have seldom been initiated in ATC. 
The c ombination  of rarity of the diagnosis  and extremely limited median survival of 4 -6 
months, has made it difficult to accrue to randomized clinical trials (McIver, Hay et al. 
2001; Goutsouliak and Hay 2005; Sherman, Lim et al. 2011; Mohebati, Dilorenzo et al. 
MC1679 12  Amendment 1 
Version date: 21Nov2017  2014). Therefore, to date, doxorubicin, with its very limited efficacy, is the only FDA-
approved agent for the treatment of this malignancy. New treatment strategies and agents 
are sorely needed  – but highly challenging to develop and pilot.  
In the absence of currently available randomized data, and considering impediments in 
obtaining such data in the near future, we , at the Mayo Clinic  initiated an aggressive 
combined- modality treatment strategy offered to a selective, consecutively treated cohort 
of ATC patients at our institution. We hypothesized that implementation of practice change, embracing more uniform and aggressive multimodal therapy (MMT; including 
surgery, c ombination chemotherapy and intensity modulated radiation therapy) as 
feasible, might lead to improved survival. We carefully select patients for this treatment protocol after a thorough multidisciplinary assessment with input from medical oncology, radiat ion oncology and otorhinolaryngology. Consenting patients who are fit, have no 
stage IVC disease, and are expected to have negative margins after resection of the thyroid mass, undergo surgery. Combination chemotherapy, preferably weekly dosing, is 
initiat ed as soon as the patient has convalesced from surgery , or immediately if surgery is 
not planned. Radiation therapy with intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) is initiated after careful review and planning by radiation oncologists either as an adjuvant 
or primary therapy. This therapy obviously has its usual expected toxicities such as mucositis, dysphagia, pain, nausea, vomiting, weight loss, cytopenias , and neutropenic 
fever. Nearly half of the patients undergo feeding tube placement and require hospitalization for complications related to dehydration, mucositis, and pain control. 
However, the protocol is usually completed with close monitoring and init iation of 
mitigating measures promptly for toxicities.  
We have previously published the outcomes of 10 consecutively treated stage IVA and 
IVB ATC patients from our institution and demonstrated that with aggressive combined 
modality treatment median OS wa s dramatically improved when compared to an 
historical cohort of patients treated at our institution in the preceding 50 years (60 months 
versus 5 -6 months) (McIver, Hay et al. 2001 ; Foote, Molina et al. 2011 ). We have 
continued to use this MMT approach and have now treated 30 patients with this method. 
Eighteen (18)  were treated with best supportive care using a  short course of palliative 
radiation (palliative group). We completed the MMT in most patients. In the MMT  
cohort, surgery and chemoradiation therapy was administered to 27 (90%) and 30 (100%) 
patients respectively.  Twenty (70%) patients received ≥80% of planned chemotherapy 
doses during radiation therapy.  
Median overall survival ( OS) was 21 months, and 1 year survival was 57% (95% CI, 39-
74; Figure 5A ). However, it appears that this approach has not improved the survival of 
stage IVC patients. OS of stage IVC patients did not differ in MMT versus the palliative  
cohort (HR, 1.15, 0.4- 3.2; P=0.78; Figure 5B ). The m ajority of the patients, including the 
MMT cohort, ultimately died of distant disease. In the MMT cohort , 2 of 27 (7%) 
patients had locoregional relapse and 21 of 27 (77%) had new distant metastasis or 
progression of distant metastasis on follow up.  
MC1679 14  Amendment 1 
Version date: 21Nov2017  Thus, we hypothesize that a multimodal therapy protocol involving surgery, 
chemotherapy, and radiation therapy coupled with immunotherapy with an anti -PD1 
agent such as pembrolizumab will decrease the incidence of distant metastasis in this 
disease thus improving survival outcomes.  
1.8 Rationale for correlative studies 
1.81 Immune phenotyping the peripheral blood  
As not all patien ts respond to immunotherapeutic approaches, there is 
considerable importance for the elucidation of pre-and on-going therapy 
biomarkers that predict therapeutic responses. Tumor- driven alte rations in the 
phenotype and/or trafficking of immune subtypes from the periphery and into 
tumors may be identified by examining the peripheral blood of cancer patients 
(Gustafson, Lin et al. 2014 ). Comprehensive multi- color FACS analyses of 
whole blood using an established and published protocol has identified distinct 
immune profiles from a broad spectrum of cancer patients that may be unique or 
shared across cancer types, are distinct from healthy controls, and predict 
outcomes. For example, immune phenotyping suggests that a higher ratio of 
CD4+ T cells to CD14+HLAlo/neg monocytes (putative MDSC) in peripheral blood 
independently predicts prolonged survival in cancer patients (Gustafson, Lin et 
al. 2015). Furthermore, increased concentration of peripheral blood 
CD14+HLAlo/neg monocytes may hinder the generation of activ ated, mature DCs 
in DC vaccine protocols, perhaps contributing to mixed responses in DC vaccine 
trials (Laborde, Lin et al. 2014). Thus, the state of host immunity and the ability 
to induce anti -tumor r esponses is a critical component for immune checkpoint 
inhibitors. We  hypothesize that d ynamic immune phenotyping pre- and post 
chemoradiation (combined with pembrolizumab)  will serve as a biomarker for 
immune-driven alterations in the tumor that can be used to identify responders 
and/or to identify cell types associated with resistance that can be used to develop 
improved combination immune base strategies to improve overall response rates.  
1.82 Response evaluations using cytokines, genetics and antithyroid antibodies 
As noted above, there is a strong need to identify potential biomarkers for responses to immune -based therapeutics as well as understand toxicities or 
immune- related adverse effects (irAEs ) following immune based therapies. 
Analyses of cytokine alternations pre-and post pembrolizumab in the serum may reflect relevant immune -related alterations at the tumor site as well as 
systemically. These profiles may be used to better predict patients l ikely to 
respond to on-going pembrolizumab infusions as well as at risk for potential 
irAEs that may be minimized with early interventions.  
Thyroid autoantibody screens: ATCs often develop from differentiated thyroid 
cancers (DTC), the latter of which are often associated, at least initially, with 
clinical and/or subclinical autoimmune thyroid disease (i.e. an anti-thyroid 
response). In DTCs co -existent with autoimmune thyroid disease, overall 
outcomes are reportedly favorable from limited studies, suggest ing the presence 
of an intact anti-tumor immune response. As DTCs progress, however, to PDTC and ATCs, tumors become heavily infiltrated with TAMs that , together with 
acquired intrinsic tumor cell genetic alterations, promote an immunosuppressive 
tumor environment and tumor escape from host- mediated anti -tumor control. We 
hypothesize that development of anti-thyroid antibodies could predict the 
responders from non-responders when treated with pembrolizumab.

Version date: 21Nov2017  BRAF, P53 and TERT mutations are common in ATC and likely contribute to 
the pathogenicity  (Liu, Bishop et al. 2016 ). Molecular alterations within the 
ATCs may also identify molecular pathways associated with response and/or 
resistance to pembrolizumab ( Brauner, Gunda et al. 2016) . This may allow future 
studies where they could be targeted  to improve anti- PD-1 response and 
overcome resistance. We will therefore interrogate if these somatic mutations are 
associated with the proposed outcomes in a prospective fashion . 
1.83 Circulating Tumor Cells (CTCs)  
The load and d ecrease in CTC  numbers have been shown to be prognostic 
markers in many cancers including breast (Cristofanilli, Budd et al. 2004 ; Liu, 
Shields et al. 2009; Smerage, Barlow et al. 2014 ) and thyroid cancer ( Xu, Handy 
et al. 2016). However, data from ATC is lacking and we will aim to 
prospectively collect circulating tumor cells and correlate with outcomes.  The 
RareCyte CTC technology is a comprehensive, reproducible and highly sensitive dual-platform for collecting, identifying and analyzing CTCs that does not rely 
on EpCAM expression for enrichment. ( Campton, Ramirez et al. 2015). This 
platform allows  for mechanically precise CTC retrieval, enabling the isolation of 
DNA derived from single or pooled CTCs for advanced genomic analyses including the detection of specific mutations and targeted NGS.

candidate biomarkers for outcomes.  
2.43 To determine if pre- therapy circulating tumor cell load is associated with 
outcomes. 
2.44 To examine associations between outcomes and somatic mutational status as 
assessed by foundation medicine analysis ( for example: presen ce of BRAF, RAS, 
P53 and TERT promoter mutations ).

Version date: 21Nov2017  6.0 Registration/Randomization Procedures  
6.1 Registration 
To register a patient, access the Mayo Clinic Cancer Center (MCCC) web page and enter 
the remote registration/randomization application. The registration/randomization 
application is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Back up and/or system support contact information is available on the Web site. If unable to access the Web site, call the MCCC Registration Office a  between the hours of 8 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. 
Central Time (Monday through Friday). 
The instructions for the registration/randomization application are available on the 
MCCC web page  and detail the process for 
completing and confirming patient registration. Prior to initiation of protocol treatment, 
this p
rocess must be completed in its entirety and a MCCC subject ID number must be 
available as noted in the instructions. It is the responsibility of the individual and institution registering the patient to confirm the process has been successfully completed 
prior to release of the study agent. Patient registration via the registration/randomization 
application can be confirmed in any of the following ways: 
• Contact the MCCC Registration Office . If the
  patient was fully 
registered, the MCCC Registration Office staff can access the information from the centralized database and confirm the r egistration.  
• Refer to “Instructions for Remote Registration” in section “Finding/Displaying 
Information about A Registered Subject.” 
6.2 Verification

MC1679 28  Amendment 1 
Version date: 21Nov2017  8.0 Dosage Modification Based on Adverse Events  
Strictly follow the modifications in the following tables  until individual treatment tolerance can 
be ascertained. Thereafter, these modifications should be regarded as guidelines  to produce 
mild-to-moderate, but not debilitating, side effects. If multiple adverse events are seen, 
administer dose based on greatest reduction required for any single adverse event observed.

discretion. Permanently discontinue study drug for persistent Grade 2 adverse reactions for which treatment with study drug has been held, that do not recover to Grade 0-1 within 12 weeks of the last dose. 
8.21 Other instructions for pembrolizumab 
If pembrolizumab-related toxicity does not resolve to Grade 0-1 within 12 weeks after last administration of study drug, study therapy discontinuation is 
recommended. With Investigator agreement, patients with a laboratory adverse 
event still at Grade 2 may continue in the study only if asymptomatic and 
controlled. 
For patients who experience a recurrence of the same severe AEs listed above 
with rechallenge of pembrolizumab, a consultation with the Investigator will 
occur to determine whether the patient should continue in the study. A patient who experiences the same SAE of the same NCI CTCAE grade or higher with 
rechallenge of pembrolizumab must discontinue pembrolizumab immediately. 
Reduced dose of pembrolizumab dose (ie, below 200 mg) will not be 
administered.

9.0 Ancillary Treatment/Supportive Care  
9.1 Full supportive care  
Patients should receive full supportive care while on this study. This includes blood 
product support, antibiotic treatment, and treatment of other newly diagnosed or 
concurrent medical conditions. All blood products and concomitant medications such as 
antidiarrheals, analgesics, and/or antiemetics received from the first day of study 
treatment administration until 30 days after the final d ose will be recorded in the medical 
records.  
Suggested supportive care measures for the management of adverse events with potential immunologic etiology are outlined below. Where appropriate, these guidelines include 
the use of oral or intravenous treatmen t with corticosteroids as well as additional anti -
inflammatory agents if symptoms do not improve with administration of corticosteroids. 
Note that several courses of steroid tapering may be necessary as symptoms may worsen 
when the steroid dose is decreased. For each disorder, attempts should be made to rule 
out other causes such as metastatic disease or bacterial or viral infection, which might 
require additional supportive care. The treatment guidelines are intended to be applied 
when the investigator de termines the events to be related to pembrolizumab. 
Note: if after the evaluation the event is determined not to be related, the investigator does not need to follow the treatment guidance (as outlined below). Refer to Section 8.2 for dose modification. 
It may be necessary to perform conditional procedures such as bronchoscopy, endoscopy, 
or skin photography as part of evaluation of the event. 
9.2 Blood products and growth factors  
Blood products and growth factors should be utilized as clinically warranted and 
following institutional policies and recommendations. The use of growth factors should follow published guidelines of the Journal of Clinical Oncology, Vol 24, No 18 (June 20), 2006: pp. 2932-2947. 
9.21 Neutropenia  
MC1679 33  Amendment 1 
Version date: 21Nov2017  Prophylactic use of colony- stimulating factors including Granulocyte Colony-
Stimulating Factor (G -CSF), pegylated G- CSF or Granulocyte Macrophage 
Colony- Stimulating Factor GM -CSF is not allowed in this study. Therapeutic use 
of G- CSF is allowed in patients with Grade 3 -4 febrile neutropenia.  
9.22 Anemia  
Transfusions and/or erythropoietin may be utilized as clinically indicated for the 
treatment of anemia, but should be clearly noted as concurrent medications.  
9.23 Thrombocytopenia 
Transfusion of platelets may be used if clinically indicated. ITP should be ruled out before initiation of platelet transfusion. 
9.3 Anti-infectives  
Patients with a documented infectious complication should receive oral or IV antibiotics or other anti -infective agents as considered appropriate by the treating Investigator for a 
given infectious condition, according to standard institutional practice. 
9.4 Corticosteroids 
Patients may continue on steroid inhalation therapy. Systemic corticosteroids are known 
immunosuppressive agents that can mitigate the effects of pembrolizumab. Steroids should be generally reserved to treat side effects of pembrolizumab. Steroids can be used as primary prevention of nausea per institutional guideline s, but steroid doses should be 
reduced in subsequent cycles if nausea/vomiting is absent or very mild (see Section 9.5).  
9.5 Antiemetics  
Antiemetics may be used at the discretion of the attending physician. Nausea and vomiting should be treated aggressivel y, and consideration should be given to the 
administration of prophylactic antiemetic therapy according to standard institutional practice. Patients should be strongly encouraged to maintain liberal oral fluid intake. Volume depletion should be corrected before initiation of study drug. 
If no or minimal nausea/vomiting is reported after first dose of chemotherapy , 
investigators are strongly encouraged to reduce the dose of dexamethasone to 10 mg 
as pre -treatment anti -emetic dosing on Day 8. In addition, if nausea/vomiting 
continues to be a minimal issue, investigators are strongly encouraged to progressively decrease the pre- treatment dose of dexamethasone in subsequent 
doses (eg, 8 mg, 6 mg, 4 mg, 2 mg, or zero). 
9.6 Anti-diarrheals 
Patients should be monit ored for signs and symptoms of enterocolitis (such as diarrhea, 
abdominal pain, blood or mucus in stool, with or without fever) and of bowel perforation (such as peritoneal signs and ileus). In symptomatic patients, infectious etiologies should be ruled ou t, and if symptoms are persistent and/or severe, endoscopic evaluation should 
be considered. (See Section 9.7 for management of treatment -related enterocolitis)  
All patients who experience diarrhea should be advised to drink liberal quantities of clear fluids. If sufficient oral fluid intake is not feasible, fluid and electrolytes should be 
substituted via IV infusion. 
NOTE: Loperamide/diphenoxylate/atropines should NOT be used for diarrhea symptoms 
unless: (1) it is believed that pembrolizumab- related enterocolitis is unlikely to be present 
after detailed evaluation by gastroenterology, including endoscopy; PLUS (2) approval is documented by a gastroenterology specialist.  
9.7 Immunotherapy- related toxicities  
MC1679 34  Amendment 1 
Version date: 21Nov2017  Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of immunotherapy- related 
toxicities, which include but are not limited to the following: 
• Pneumonitis  
o For Grade 2 events, treat with systemic corticosteroids. When symptoms improve 
to Grade 1 or less, steroid taper should be started and continued over no less than 
4 weeks.  
o For Grade 3 -4 events, immediately treat with intravenous steroids. Administer 
additional anti -inflammatory measures, as needed.  
o Add prophylactic antibiotics for opportunistic infections in the case of prolonged 
steroid administrat ion. 
• Diarrhea/colitis  
Patients should be carefully monitored for signs and symptoms of enterocolitis (such as diarrhea, abdominal pain, blood or mucus in stool, with or without fever) and of bowel perforation (such as peritoneal signs and ileus).  
o All patie nts who experience diarrhea/colitis should be advised to drink liberal 
quantities of clear fluids. If sufficient oral fluid intake is not feasible, fluid and 
electrolytes should be substituted via IV infusion. For Grade 2 or higher diarrhea, 
consider GI co nsultation and endoscopy to confirm or rule out colitis. 
o For Grade 2 diarrhea/colitis, administer oral corticosteroids.  
o For Grade 3 or 4 diarrhea/colitis, treat with intravenous steroids followed by high dose oral steroids.  
o When symptoms improve to Grade 1 or less, steroid taper should be started and continued over no less than 4 weeks.  
• Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus  (if new onset, including diabetic ketoacidosis [DKA]) 
or ≥Grade 3 Hyperglycemia, if associated with ketosis (ketonuria) or metabolic acidosis (DKA)  
For T1DM  or Grade 3 -4 Hyperglycemia:  
o Insulin replacement therapy is recommended for Type I diabetes mellitus and for Grade 3 -4 hyperglycemia associated with metabolic acidosis or ketonuria.  
o Evaluate patients with serum glucose and a metabolic panel, urine ketones, glycosylated hemoglobin, and C-peptide. 
• Hypophysitis  
o For Grade 2  events, treat with corticosteroids. When symptoms improve to 
Grade 1 or less, steroid taper should be started and continued over no less than 4 weeks. Replacement of appropriate hormones may be required as the steroid dose 
is tapered.  
o For Grade 3 -4 events , treat with an initial dose of IV corticosteroids followed by 
oral corticosteroids. When symptoms improve to Grade 1 or less, steroid taper should be started and continued over no less than 4 weeks. Replacement of 
appropriate hormones may be required as the steroid dose is tapered. 
• Hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism  
Thyroid disorders can occur at any time during treatment. Monitor patients for changes in thyroid function (at the start of treatment, periodically during treatment, and as indicated based on cl inical evaluation) and for clinical signs and symptoms of 
thyroid disorders. 
o Grade 2  hyperthyroidism events (and Grade 2 -4 hypothyroidism):  
 In hyperthyroidism, non- selective beta-blockers (e.g. propranolol) are 
suggested as initial therapy.  
MC1679 35  Amendment 1 
Version date: 21Nov2017   In hypothyroidism, thyroid hormone replacement therapy, with levothyroxine 
or liothyroinine, is indicated per standard of care. 
o Grade 3 -4 hyperthyroidism  
 Treat with an initial dose of IV corticosteroid followed by oral 
corticosteroids. When symptoms improve to Grade 1 or less, steroid taper 
should be started and continued over no less than 4 weeks. Replacement of appropriate hormones may be required as the steroid dose is tapered. 
• Hepatic  
o For Grade 2  events, monitor liver function tests more frequently unt il 
returned to baseline values (consider weekly).  
 Treat with IV or oral corticosteroids 
 For Grade 3 -4 events, treat with intravenous corticosteroids for 24 to 48 
hours.  
o When symptoms improve to Grade 1 or less, a steroid taper should be started and continued over no less than 4 weeks. 
• Renal failure or nephritis  
o For Grade 2  events, treat with corticosteroids.  
o For Grade 3 -4 events, treat with systemic corticosteroids.  
o When symptoms improve to Grade 1 or less, steroid taper should be started 
and continued over no less than 4 weeks.  
9.8 Management of treatment related enterocolitis  
In patients with severe enterocolitis, pembrolizumab will be held and treatment with 
systemic corticosteroids should be initiated at a dose of 1 to 2 mg/kg/day of prednisone or equivalent. When symptoms improve to Grade 1 or less, corticosteroid taper should be started and continued over at least 1 month.  
In patients with moderate enterocolitis, pembrolizumab should be withheld and 
antidiarrheal treatment should be started. If symptoms are persistent for more than one week, systemic corticosteroids should be initiated (e.g., 0.5 mg/kg/day of prednisone or equivalent). When symptoms improve to Grade 1 or less, corticosteroid taper should be started and continued over at least 1 month. 
9.9a Concomitant Medications/Vaccinations (Allowed & Prohibited) 
Medications or vaccinations specifically prohibited in the exclusion criteria are not allowed during the ongoing trial. If there is a clinical indication for any medication or vaccinat ion specifically prohibited during the trial, discontinuation from trial therapy or 
vaccination may be required. The final decision on any supportive therapy or vaccination rests with the investigator and/or the patient’s primary physician. 
9.9a1 Acceptabl e Concomitant Medications  
All treatments that the investigator considers necessary for a subject’s welfare 
may be administered at the discretion of the investigator in keeping with the community standards of medical care. All concomitant medication will be recorded in the case report forms (CRF) including all prescription, over -the-
counter (OTC), herbal supplements, and IV medications and fluids. If changes occur during the trial period, documentation of drug dosage, frequency, route, and date may also be i ncluded on the CRF. 
All concomitant medications received within 28 days before the first dose of trial treatment and 30 days after the last dose of trial treatment should be recorded. 
MC1679 36  Amendment 1 
Version date: 21Nov2017  Concomitant medications administered 30 days after the last dose of trial 
treatment should be recorded for SAEs and ECIs as defined in Section 10. 
9.9a2 Prohibited Concomitant Medications 
The following medications are not  permitted during the screening and treatment 
phase (including retreatment for post- complete response relap se) of this trial: 
• Anti-neoplastic systemic cytotoxic chemotherapy or biological therapy 
• Immunotherapy not specified in this protocol 
• Chemotherapy not specified in this protocol 
• Investigational agents other than pembrolizumab  
• Live vaccines within 30 days prior to the first dose of trial treatment and 
while participating in the trial. Examples of live vaccines include, but are not 
limited to, the following: measles, mumps, rubella, varicella/zoster, yellow 
fever, intranasal influenza, rabies, BCG, and typhoi d vaccine.  
• Systemic glucocorticoids for any purpose other than to modulate symptoms from an event of clinical interest of suspected immunologic etiology. The use 
of physiologic doses of corticosteroids may be approved after consultation 
with the principal investigator.  
NOTE: Use of steroids during chemoradiation for controlling chemotherapy-associated nausea and docetaxel associated edema is allowed.  
Patients who, in the assessment by the investigator, require the use of any of the 
aforementioned treatments for clinical management should be removed from the 
trial. Patients may receive other medications that the investigator deems to be 
medically necessary.

†Abstinence (relative to heterosexual activity) can be used as the sole method of contraception if it is consistently employed as the sub ject’s preferred and usual lifestyle 
and if considered acceptable by local regulatory agencies and ERCs/IRBs.  Periodic 
abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, sympto-thermal, post-ovulation methods, etc.) and 
withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.  
‡If a contraceptive method listed above is restricted by local regulations/guidelines, then 
it does not qualify as an acceptable method of contraception for patients participating at sites in this country/region. 
Patients should be informed that taking the study medication may involve unknown risks 
to the fetus (unborn baby) if pregnancy were to occur during the study. In order to 
participate in the study patients of childbearing potential must adhere to the contraception 
requirement (described ab ove) from the day of study medication initiation (or 14 days 
prior to the initiation of study medication for oral contraception) throughout the study 
period up to 120 days after the last dose of trial therapy. If there is any question that a 
patient of chi ldbearing potential will not reliably comply with the requirements for 
contraception, that patient should not be entered into the study. 
MC1679 39  Amendment 1 
Version date: 21Nov2017  9.9d Use in Pregnancy  
If a patient inadvertently becomes pregnant while on treatment with pembrolizumab, the 
patient will immediately be removed from the study. The site will contact the patient at 
least monthly and document the patient’s status until the pregnancy has been completed 
or terminated. The outcome of the pregnancy will be reported to Mayo Clinic and to 
Merck w ithout delay and within 24 hours to Mayo Clinic and within 2 working days to 
Merck if the outcome is a serious adverse experience (e.g., death, abortion, congenital 
anomaly, or other disabling or life-threatening complication to the mother or newborn).  
The study investigator will make every effort to obtain permission to follow the outcome 
of the pregnancy and report the condition of the fetus or newborn. If a male subject 
impregnates his female partner the study personnel at the site must be informed imme diately and the pregnancy reported to Mayo Clinic and to Merck and followed as 
described above.  
9.9e Use in Nursing Adults 
Since many drugs are excreted in human milk, and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in the nursing infant, patients who are breast -feeding are not eligible for 
enrollment. Specific additional information follows for individual agents used in this trial. 
9.9e1 Pembrolizumab 
It is unknown whether pembrolizumab is excreted in human milk. 
9.9e2 Docetaxel and Doxorubicin 
Doxorubicin has been reported to be found in human milk; patients receiving doxorubicin injection should not breast- feed.  It is unknown if docetaxel is 
excreted inhuman milk, it is recommended that breast feeding be discontinued. 
  
MC1679 40  Amendment 1 
Version date: 21Nov2017  10.0 Adverse Event (AE) Monitoring and Reporting  
The site principal investigator is responsible for reporting any/all serious adverse events to the 
sponsor as described within the protocol, regardless of attribution to study agent or treatment 
procedure. 
The sponsor/sponsor- investigator is responsible for notifying FDA and all participating 
investigators in a written safety report of any of the following: 
• Any suspected adverse reaction that is both serious and unexpected. 
• Any findings from laboratory animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for 
human subjects, including reports of mutagenicity, teratogenicity, or carcinogenicity. 
• Any findings from epidemiological studies, pooled analysis of multiple studies, or 
clinical studies, whether or not conducted under an IND and whether or not conducted by 
the sponsor, that suggest a significant risk in humans exposed to the drug  
• Any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over the rate stated in the protocol or Investigator’s Br ochure (IB).

Definitions  
Adverse Event  
Any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether or 
not considered drug related.  
Suspe cted Adverse Reaction  
Any adverse event for which there is a reasonable possibility that the drug caused the adverse 
event.  
Expedited Reporting  
Events reported to sponsor within 24 hours, 5 days or 10 days of study team becoming aware 
of the event.  
Routine Reporting 
Events reported to sponsor via case report forms 
  
MC1679 41  Amendment 1 
Version date: 21Nov2017  Events of Interest  
Events that would not typically be considered to meet the criteria for expedited reporting, but 
that for a specific protocol are being reported via expedited means in order to  facilitate the 
review of safety data (may be requested by the FDA or the sponsor).  
Unanticipated Adverse Device Event (UADE) 
Any serious adverse effect on health or safety or any life-threatening problem or death caused by, or associated with, a device, if that effect, problem, or death was not previously identified 
in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the investigational plan or application (including a supplementary plan or application), or any other unanticipated serious problem associated 
with a device that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects  
10.1 Adverse Event Characteristics  
CTCAE term (AE description) and grade: The descriptions and grading scales found 
in the revised NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CT CAE) version 
4.0 will be utilized for AE reporting. All appropriate treatment areas should have access to a copy of the CTCAE version 4.0. A copy of the CTCAE version 4.0 can be 
downloaded from the CTEP web site: 
(http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic applications/ctc.htm
) 
a. Identify the grade and severity of the event using the CTCAE version 4.0. 
b. Determine whether the event is expected or unexpected (see Section 10.2). 
c. Determine if the adverse event is related to the study intervention (agent, treatment or 
procedure) (see Section 10.3). 
d. Determine whether the event must be reported as an expedited report. If yes, 
determine the timeframe/mechanism (see Sec tion 10.4).  
e. Determine if other reporting is required (see Section 10.5).  
f. Note: All AEs reported via expedited mechanisms must also be reported via the 
routine data reporting mechanisms defined by the protocol (see Sections 10.6 and 18.0). 
NOTE: A severe AE is NOT the same as a serious AE, which is defined in Section 10.4.  
10.2 Expected vs. Unexpected Events  
Expected events - are those described within the Section 15.0 of the protocol, the study 
specific consent form, package insert (if applicable), and/or the investigator brochure, (if 
an investigator brochure is not required, otherwise described in the general 
investigatio nal plan).  
Unexpected adverse events or suspected adverse reactions are those not listed in Section 
15.0 of the protocol, the study specific consent form, package insert (if applicable), or in the investigator brochure (or are not listed at the specificity or severity that has been 
observed); if an investigator brochure is not required or available, is not consistent with 
the risk information described in the general investigational plan. 
Unexpected  also refers to adverse events or suspected adverse reactions that are 
mentioned in the investigator brochure as occurring with a class of drugs but have not 
been observed with the drug under investigation. 
An investigational agent/intervention might exace rbate the expected AEs associated with a 
commercial agent. Therefore, if an expected AE (for the commercial agent) occurs with a higher degree of severity or specificity, expedited reporting is required. 
MC1679 42  Amendment 1 
Version date: 21Nov2017  NOTE: *The consent form may contain study specific i nformation at the discretion of the 
Principal Investigator; it is possible that this information may NOT be included in the 
protocol or the investigator brochure. Refer to protocol or IB for reporting needs.  
10.3 Attribution to agent(s) or procedure  
When a ssessing whether an adverse event (AE) is related to a medical agent(s) medical or 
procedure, the following attribution categories are utilized: 
Definite - The AE is clearly related to the agent(s)/procedure.  
Probable - The AE is likely related to the agen t(s)/procedure. 
Possible - The AE may be related to the agent(s)/procedure. 
Unlikely - The AE is doubtfully related to the agent(s)/procedure.  
Unrelated - The AE is clearly NOT related to the agent(s)/procedure.  
10.31 AEs Experienced Utilizing Investigatio nal Agents and Commercial Agent(s) 
on the SAME  (Combination) Arm  
NOTE:  When a commercial agent(s) is (are) used on the same treatment arm as 
the investigational agent/intervention (also, investigational drug, biologic, 
cellular product, or other investigational therapy under an IND), the entire 
combination (arm) is then considered an investigational intervention for 
reporting . 
• An AE that occurs on a combination study must be assessed in accordance with the 
guidelines for investigational  agents/interventions.  
• An AE that occurs prior to administration of the investigational agent/intervention must be assessed as specified in the protocol. In general, only Grade 4 and 5 AEs 
that are unexpected with at least possible attribution to the commercial agent require 
an expedited report, unless hospitalization is required. Refer to Section 10.4 for 
specific AE reporting requirements or exceptions.  
An investigational agent/intervention might exacerbate the expected AEs associated 
with a commercial agent. Therefore, if an expected AE (for the commercial agent) 
occurs with a higher degree of severity or specificity, expedited reporting is 
required.  
• An increased incidence of an expected adverse event (AE) is based on the 
patients treated for this study at their site. A list of  known/expected AEs is 
reported in the package insert or the literature, including AEs resulting from a drug overdose. 
• Commercial agent expedited reports must be submitted to the FDA via MedWatch  
3500A for Health Professionals (complete all three pages of the form).

MC1679 43  Amendment 1 
Version date: 21Nov2017  10.32 EXPECTED Serious Adverse Events: Protocol Specific Exceptions to 
Expedited Reportin g 
For this protocol only, the following Adverse Events/Grades are expected to occur within this population and do not require Expedited Reporting. These events must still 
be reported via Routine Reporting (see Section 10.6).*  
*Report any clinically importa nt increase in the rate of a serious suspected 
adverse reaction (at your study site) over that which is listed in the protocol or investigator brochure as an expedited event.  
*Report an expected event that is greater in severity or specificity than expect ed 
as an expedited event.

Specific protocol exceptions to expedited reporting should be reported 
expeditiously by investigators ONLY  if they exceed the expected grade of the 
event.  
The following hospitalizations are not considered to be SAEs because there is no “adverse event” (i.e., there is no untoward medical occurrence) associated with the hospitalization:  
● Hospitalizations for respite care  
● Planned hospitalizations required by the protocol 
● Hospitalization planned before informed consent (where the condition requiring the hospitalization 
has not changed post study drug administration) 
● Hospitalization for elective procedures unrelated to the current disease and/or treatment on this trial  
● Hospitalization for administration of study drug or insertion of access for administration of study 
drug 
● Hospitalizatio n for routine maintenance of a device ( e.g., battery replacement) that was in place 
before study entry 
● Hospitalization  or other serious outcomes for signs and symptoms of progression of the cancer.

10.43 Reporting of re -occurring SAEs 
ALL SERIOUS adverse events that meet the criteria outlined in table10.41 
MUST be immediately reported to the sponsor within the timeframes detailed in 
the corresponding table. This reporting includes, but is not limited to SAEs that re-occur again after resolution.  
10.5 Other Required Reporting 
10.51  Unanticipated Problems Involving Risks to Subjects or Others (UPIRTSOS)  
Unanticipated Problems Involving Risks to Subjects or Others (UPIRTSOS) in 
general, include any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all of the 
following criteria:  
1. Unexpected (in terms of nature, severity, or frequency) given (a) the research 
procedures that are described in the protocol -related documents, such as the 
IRB-approved research protocol and informed consent document; and (b) the 
characteristics of the subject population being studied;  
2. Related or possibly related to participation in the research (in thi s guidance 
document, possibly related means there is a reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or outcome may have been caused by the procedures 
involved in the research); and 
3. Suggests that the research places subjects or others at a greater risk of harm 
(including physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or recognized. 
Some unanticipated problems involve social or economic harm instead of the 
physical or psychological harm associated with adverse events. In other cases, 
unanticipated problems place subjects or others at increased risk of harm, but no 
harm occurs.  
Note: I f there is no language in the protocol indicating that pregnancy is not 
considered an adverse experience for this trial, and if the consent form does not 
indicate that subjects should not get pregnant/impregnate others, then any 
pregnancy in a subject/patient or a male patient’s partner (spontaneously 

MC1679 47  Amendment 1 
Version date: 21Nov2017  o Treatmen t-related secondary malignancy  
• Any malignancy possibly related to cancer treatment (including AML/MDS) 
should also be reported via the routine reporting mechanisms outlined in each 
protocol.  
10.54 Second Malignancy  
A second malignancy is one unrelated to t he treatment of a prior malignancy (and is 
NOT a metastasis from the initial malignancy). Second malignancies require ONLY 
routine reporting unless otherwise specified. 
10.55 Pregnancy, Fetal Death, and Death Neonatal  
If a female subject (or female partner of a male subject) taking investigational 
product becomes pregnant, the subject taking should notify the Investigator, and the pregnant female should be advised to call her healthcare provider immediately. The patient should have appropriate follow- up as deemed necessary 
by her physician. If the baby is born with a birth defect or anomaly, a second expedited report is required. 
Prior to obtaining private information about a pregnant woman and her infant, the 
investigator must obtain consent from the pregnant woman and the newborn 
infant’s parent or legal guardian before any data collection can occur. A consent 
form will need to be submitted to the IRB for these subjects if a pregnancy occurs. If informed consent is not obtained, no information may be collected.  
In cases of fetal death, miscarriage or abortion, the mother is the patient. In cases where the child/fetus experiences a serious adverse event other than fetal death, 
the child/fetus is the patient.  
NOTE: When submitting Mayo Expedited Adverse Event Report reports for 
“Pregnancy”, “Pregnancy loss”, or “Neonatal loss”, the potential risk of exposure 
of the fetus to the investigational agent(s) or chemotherapy agent(s) should be 
documented in the “Description of Event” section. Include any availa ble medical 
documentation. Include this form:

10.8 Merck  Additional Event Reporting Instructions 
10.81 Events of Clinical Interest (ECIs)  
ECIs are selected non-serious and serious adverse experiences that must be 
reported within 24 hours to Mayo Clinic via email and within 2 working days to 
Merck Global Safety (Attn: Worldwide Product Safety ). 
For the time period beginning when the consent form is signed until treatment allocation/randomization, any ECI, or follow up to an ECI, that occurs to any subject must be reported within 24 hours to the Sponsor and within 2 working 
days to Merck Global Safety if it causes the subject to be excluded from  the trial, 
or is the result of a protocol -specified intervention, including but not limited to 
washout or discontinuation of usual therapy, diet, placebo treatment or a 
procedure. 
For the time period beginning at treatment allocation/randomization through 90 
days following cessation of treatment, or 30 days following cessation of 
treatment if the subject initiates new anticancer therapy, whichever is earlier, any 
ECI, or follow up to an ECI, whether or not related to Merck product, must be 
reported within 24 hours to the Sponsor and within 24 hours to Merck Global Safety.  
Events of clinical interest for this trial include:  
1. An overdose of Merck product, as defined in Section 10.82, that is not 
associated with clinical symptoms or abnormal laboratory resul ts.  
2. An elevated AST or ALT lab value that is greater than or equal to 3X the 
upper limit of normal and an elevated total bilirubin lab value that is greater than 
or equal to 2X the upper limit of normal and, at the same time, an alkaline 
phosphatase la b value that is less than 2X the upper limit of normal, as 
determined by way of protocol-specified laboratory testing or unscheduled 
laboratory testing.* 
*Note: These criteria are based upon available regulatory guidance documents. 
The purpose of the crite ria is to specify a threshold of abnormal hepatic tests that 
may require an additional evaluation for an underlying etiology. 
10.82 Reporting of Overdose of Pembrolizumab 
For purposes of this trial, an overdose of pembrolizumab will be defined as any dose of 1,000 mg or greater (≥5 times the indicated dose). No specific 

MC1679 50  Amendment 1 
Version date: 21Nov2017  information is available on the treatment of overdose of pembrolizumab. In the 
event of overdose, the subject should be observed closely for signs of toxicity. 
Appropriate supportive treatment should be provided if clinically indicated. 
If an adverse event(s) is associated with (“results from”) the overdose of a Merck 
product (pembrolizumab), the adverse event(s) is reported as a serious adverse 
event, even if no other seriousness criteria are met.  
If a dose of Merck’s product (pembrolizumab) meeting the protocol definition of 
overdose is taken without any associated clinical symptoms or abnormal 
laboratory results, the overdose is reported as a non -serious Event of Clinical 
Interest (ECI), us ing the terminology “accidental or intentional overdose without 
adverse effect.”  
All reports of overdose with and without an adverse event must be reported 
within 24 hours to Mayo Clinic and within 
2 working days hours to Merck Global Safety. (Attn: Worldwide Product Safety; 
 
10.83 Addi
tional Instructions for AE Reporting to Merck  
A ser
ious adverse event is any adverse event occurring at any dose or during any 
use of Merck’s product that:  
• Results in death;  
• Is life threatening;  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity;  
• Results in or prolongs an existing inpatient hospitalization;  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect; 
• Is another important medical event  
• Note: In addition to the above criteria, adverse events meeting either of the 
below criteria, although not serious per ICH definition, are reportable to the 
Merck in the same timeframe as SAEs to meet certain local req uirements. 
Therefore, these events are considered serious by Merck for collection 
purposes. 
● Is a new cancer (that is not a condition of the study); 
● Is associated with an overdose.  
For the time period beginning when the consent form is signed until trea tment 
allocation/randomization, any serious adverse event, or follow up to a serious adverse event, including death due to any cause other than progression of the 
cancer under study that occurs to any subject must be reported within 24 hours to 
the Sponsor (Mayo Clinic) and within 2 working days to Merck Global Safety if 
it causes the subject to be excluded from the trial, or is the result of a protocol-
specified intervention, including but not limited to washout or discontinuation of usual therapy, diet, placebo treatment or a procedure.  
For the time period beginning at treatment allocation/randomization through 90 days following cessation of treatment, or 30 days following cessation of 
treatment if the subject initiates new anticancer therapy, whichever is earlier, any 
serious adverse event, or follow up to a serious adverse event, including death due to any cause other than progression of the cancer under study whether or not 
related to the Merck product, must be reported within 24 hours to the Sponsor and within 2 working days to Merck Global Safety.  
Additionally, any serious adverse event, considered by an investigator who is a qualified physician to be related to Merck product that is brought to the attention 
of the investigator at any time following consent through the end of the specified

Version date: 21Nov2017  safety follow-up period specified in the paragraph above, or at any time outside 
of the time period specified in the previous paragraph also must be reported 
immediately to the Sponsor and to Merck Global Safety. 
All p atients with serious adverse events must be followed up for outcome. 
SAE reports and any other relevant safety information are to be forwarded to the 
Merck Global Safety facsimile number:   
A copy of all 15 Day Reports and Annual Progress R eports is submitted as 
required by FDA, European Union (EU), Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices 
agency (PMDA) or other local regulators. Investigators will cross reference this 
submission according to local regulations to the Merck Investigational 
Compound Number (IND, CSA, etc.) at the time of submission. Additionally investigators will submit a copy of these reports to Merck & Co., Inc. (Attn:

MC1679 52  Amendment 1 
Version date: 21Nov2017  11.0 Treatment Evaluation Using RECIST Guideline s 
NOTE: This study uses RECIST v1.1 template dated 2/16/2011. See the footnote for the table 
regarding measureable disease in Section 11.44, as it pertains to data collection and analysis.  
Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the new international criteria 
proposed by the revised Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (R ECIST) guidelines 
(version 1.1) (Eisenhauer, Therasse et al. 2009 ) . Changes in the largest diameter (unidimensional 
measurement) of the tumor lesions and the short axis measurements in the case of lymph nodes 
are used in the RECIST guideline . 
NOTE: The primary mass and irradiated lymph nodes in neck and upper mediastinum will 
be non- measurable. 
11.1 Schedule of Evaluations  
Screening  (before surgery or chemoradiation): Baseline scan to assess the disease 
status should have been performed within 14 days prior to registration. An FDG PET -CT, 
or CT scan of neck, chest and abdomen and pelvis should be obtained. MRI of the neck is 
acceptable in lieu of CT- neck  but not preferred.  
Post-chemoradiation : The first scan after treatment initiation will be performed at the 
completion of chemoradiation. During protocol treatment scans should be performed 
every 9 weeks and then every 3 months in the observation period. Additional scans could 
be obtained at the discretion of the physician.  
11.2 Definitions of Measurable and Non -Measurable Disease  
11.21  Measurable Disease  
11.211 A non- nodal lesion is considered measurable if its longest diameter can 
be accurately measured as ≥2.0 cm with chest x-ray, or as ≥1.0 cm with 
CT scan, CT component of a PET/CT, or MRI.  
11.212 A superficial non- nodal lesion is measurable if its longest diameter is 
≥1.0 cm in diameter as assessed using calipers (e.g. skin nodules) or imaging. In the case of skin lesions, documentation by color 
photography, including a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion, is 
recommended. 
11.213 A malignant lymph node is considered measurable if its short axis is 
>1.5 cm when assessed by CT scan (CT scan slice thickness 
recommended to be no greater than 5 mm).  
11.22 Non-Measurable Disease  
11.221  All other lesions (or sites of disease) are considered non- measurable 
disease, including pathological nodes (those with a short axis ≥1.0 to 
<1.5 cm). Bone lesions, leptomeningeal di sease, ascites, pleural/ 
pericardial effusions, lymphangitis cutis/pulmonis, inflammatory breast disease, and abdominal masses (not followed by CT or MRI), are 
considered as non- measurable as well.  
Note: ‘Cystic lesions’ thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered as 
measurable lesions, if they meet the definition of measurability described above. 
However, if non- cystic lesions are present in the same patient, these are preferred 
for selection as target lesions. In addition, lymph nodes that ha ve a short axis 
MC1679 53  Amendment 1 
Version date: 21Nov2017  <1.0 cm are considered non- pathological (i.e., normal) and should not be 
recorded or followed.  
11.3 Guidelines for Evaluation of Measurable Disease  
11.31 Measurement Methods:  
• All measurements should be recorded in metric notation (i.e., de cimal 
fractions of centimeters) using a ruler or calipers.  
• The same method of assessment and the same technique must be used to 
characterize each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during 
follow-up. For patients having only lesions measuring at least 1 cm to less 
than 2 cm must use CT imaging for both pre- and post-treatment tumor 
assessments.  
• Imaging -based evaluation is preferred to evaluation by clinical examination 
when both methods have been used at the same evaluation to assess the antitumor effect of a treatment.   
11.32 Acceptable Modalities for Measurable Disease:  
Conventional CT and MRI: This guideline has defined measurability of lesions on CT scan based on the assumption that CT slice thickness is 5 mm or less. If 
CT scans have slice thickness greater than 5 mm, the minimum size for a 
measurable lesion should be twice the slice thickness.  
• As with CT, if an MRI is performed, the technical specifications of the 
scanning sequences used should be optimized for the evaluation of the type 
and site of disease. The lesions should be measured on the same pulse 
sequence. Ideally, the same type of scanner should be used and the image 
acquisition protocol should be followed as closely as possible to prior scans. 
Body scans should be performed with breath-hold scanning techniques, if 
possible. 
• PET-CT: CT portion of the PET- CT can be used for RECIST measurements 
and can be used interchangeably with conventional CT in accurately 
measuring cancer lesions over time.  
• FDG -PET: FDG -PET scanning is allowed to complement CT scanning in 
assessment of progressive disease [PD] and particu larly possible 'new' 
disease. A ‘positive’ FDG -PET scanned lesion is defined as one which is 
FDG avid with an update greater than twice that of the surrounding tissue on 
the attenuation corrected image; otherwise, an FDG- PET scanned lesion is 
considered ‘negative.’ New lesions on the basis of FDG- PET imaging can be 
identified according to the following algorithm: 
a. Negative FDG -PET at baseline with a positive FDG -PET at follow-up is 
a sign of PD based on a new lesion. 
b. No FDG -PET at baseline and a positi ve FDG -PET at follow -up:  
i. If the positive FDG- PET at follow -up corresponds to a new site of 
disease confirmed by CT, this is PD.  
ii. If the positive FDG- PET at follow -up is not confirmed as a new site 
of disease on CT at the same evaluation, additional follow -up CT 
scans (i.e., additional follow- up scans at least 4 weeks later) are 
needed to determine if there is truly progression occurring at that 
MC1679 54  Amendment 1 
Version date: 21Nov2017  site. In this situation, the date of PD will be the date of the initial 
abnormal F DG-PET scan.  
iii If the  positive FDG- PET at follow -up corresponds to a pre -existing 
site of disease on CT that is not progressing on the basis of the 
anatomic images, it is not classified as PD.  
11.33 Measurement at Follow -up Evaluation:  
• Residual  disease after chemoradiation is defined as persistent  primary 
tumor mass (FDG -avid or nonavid) or any  known distant metastatic 
disease as in AJCC stage IVC. 
• A subsequent scan must be obtained at least 4 weeks following initial 
documentation of an objective status of either complete response (CR) or partial response (PR).  
• In the case of stable disease (SD), follow -up measurements must have met 
the SD criteria at least once after study entry at a minimum interval of 8 
weeks (see Section 11.44).  
• The cytological confirmation of the neoplastic origin of any effusion that 
appears or worsens during treatment when the measurable tumor has met 
criteria for response or stable disease is mandatory to differentiate between 
response or stable disease (an effusion may be a side effect of the treatment) and progressive disease.  
• Cytologic and histologic techniques can be used to differentiate between PR 
and CR in rare cases (e.g., residual lesions in ATC after chemoradia tion can 
represent fibrotic tissue) 
11.4 Measurement of Effect  
11.41 Target Lesions & Target Lymph Nodes 
• Measurable lesions (as defined in Section 11.21) up to a maximum of 5 lesions , representative of all involved organs, should be identified as “Target 
Lesions” and recorded and measured at baseline. These lesions can be non -
nodal or nodal (as defined in 11.21), where no more than 2 lesions are from 
the same organ and no more than 2 malignant nodal lesions are selected.  
Note:  If fewer than 5  target lesions and target lymph nodes are identified (as 
there often will be), there is no reason to perform additional studies beyond those specified in the protocol to discover new lesions.  
• Target lesions and target lymph nodes should be selected on the basis of their size, be representative of all involved sites of disease, but in addition should 
be those that lend themselves to reproducible repeated measurements. It may 
be the case that, on occasion, the largest lesion (or malignant lymph node) 
does no t lend itself to reproducible measurements in which circumstance the 
next largest lesion (or malignant lymph node) which can be measured reproducibly should be selected.  
• Baseline Sum of Dimensions (BSD): A sum of the longest diameter for all 
target lesion s plus the sum of the short axis of all the target lymph nodes will 
be calculated and reported as the baseline sum of dimensions (BSD). The 
BSD will be used as reference to further characterize any objective tumor 
response in the measurable dimension of th e disease.  
MC1679 55  Amendment 1 
Version date: 21Nov2017  • Post-Baseline Sum of the Dimensions (PBSD): A sum of the longest 
diameter for all target lesions plus the sum of the short axis of all the target 
lymph nodes will be calculated and reported as the post- baseline sum of 
dimensions (PBSD). If the radiologist is able to provide an actual measure 
for the target lesion (or target lymph node), that should be recorded, even if it 
is below 0.5 cm. If the target lesion (or target lymph node) is believed to be 
present and is faintly seen but too small to measure, a default value of 0.5 cm should be assigned. If it is the opinion of the radiologist that the target lesion 
or target lymph node has likely disappeared, the measurement should be 
recorded as 0 cm.  
• The minimum sum of the dimensions (MSD) is the min imum of the BSD and 
the PBSD.  
11.42 Non-Target Lesions & Non -Target Lymph Nodes 
Non-measurable sites of disease (Section 11.22) are classified as non - target 
lesions or non-target lymph nodes and should also be recorded at  baseline. These lesions and lymph nodes should be followed in accord with 
11.433. 
11.43 Response Criteria 
11.431  All target lesions and target lymph nodes followed by CT/MRI/PET-CT/ must be measured on re- evaluation at evaluation times specified in 
Section 11.1. Specifically, a change in object ive status to either a PR or 
CR cannot be done without re- measuring target lesions and target 
lymph nodes.  
Note: Non-target lesions and non -target lymph nodes should be 
evaluated at each assessment, especially in the case of first response or 
confirmation  of response.  
11.432 Evaluation of Target Lesions 
Complete Response (CR):All of the following must be true:  
a. Disappearance of all target lesions.  
b. Each target lymph node must have reduction in short axis to 
<1.0 cm. 
Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in PBSD (sum of the 
longest diameter for all target lesions plus the sum of the short axis 
of all the target lymph nodes at current evaluation) taking as 
reference the BSD ( see Section 11.41).  
Progression (PD): At least one of the following must be true:  
a. At least one new malignant lesion, which also includes any lymph node that was normal at baseline (<1.0 cm short axis) and 
increased to ≥1.0 cm short axis during follow-up.  
b. At least a 20% increase in PBSD (sum of the longest diameter 
for all targe t lesions plus the sum of the short axis of all the 
target lymph nodes at current evaluation) taking as reference the MSD (Section 11.41). In addition, the PBSD must also 
demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 0.5 cm from the 
MSD.  
MC1679 56  Amendment 1 
Version date: 21Nov2017  c. See Section 11.32 for details in regards to the requirements for 
PD via FDG -PET imaging.  
Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR, nor 
sufficient increase to qualify for PD taking as reference the MSD.  
11.433 Evaluation of Non- Target Lesions & Non -target Lymph Nodes 
Complete Response (CR):  All of the following must be true:  
a. Disappearance of all non -target 
lesions.  
b. Each non-target lymph node must 
have a reduction in short axis to <1.0 cm.  
Non-CR/Non -PD: Persistence of one or more non- target 
lesions or non-target lymph nodes. 
Progression (PD):  At least one of the following must be 
true: 
a. At least one new malignant lesion, 
which also includes any lymph node 
that was normal at baseline (<1.0 cm short axis) and increased to ≥1.0 cm 
short axis d uring follow-up.  
b. Unequivocal progression of existing 
non-target lesions and non -target 
lymph nodes. (NOTE: Unequivocal 
progression should not normally 
trump target lesion and target lymph 
node status. It must be representative 
of overall disease status change.)

11.5 Treatment  Evaluation after Completion of S urgery and Post -operative Chemoradiation 
(Cohort A patients)  
11.51 Definition of Recurrence 
The term “recurrence” is used if cancer returns either in the locoregional area of 
the primary tumor or at distant sites following R0 or R1 resection  
11.52 How Recurrence is Determined  
Recurrence is determined radiographically and biopsy could be performed at the 
discretion of treating physician except as detailed below or when CT findings are 
equivocal in the determination of the enrolling physician.  
Locoregional recurrence : Identified by a new soft- tissue mass in the operated 
thyroid bed or regional cervical lymph nodes.  In some cases post -radiation 
changes may make it  difficult to distinguish from early tumor progression. In 
cases in which the diagnosis is ambiguous, discuss ion with the PI should occur. 
Performance of tissue biopsy should be considered prior to assigning a diagnosis 
of locoregional recurrent disease.  
 
12.0 Descriptive Factors  
12.1 Associated lympocytic/autoimmune thyroiditis: Yes  vs. no 
12.2 Coexistent diff erentiated thyroid cancer : Yes  vs. n o 
12.3 Primary tumor resected : Yes vs . no 
12.4 Prior TKI use :Yes vs. no 
12.5 Prior/remote/unrelated neck radiotherapy (therapeutic, not diagnostic) : Yes vs . no 
12.6 Prior history o f differentiated thyroid cancer: Yes  vs. no 
13.0 Treatment/Follow –up Decision at Evaluation of Patient  
13.1 Continuation of treatment  
Patients who have not had disease progression and have experienced acceptable toxicity 
are to continue treatment per protocol until confirmed PD, unacceptable toxicity or refusal. Patients with PD  will proceed  to EM and others will proceed to observation unti l 
PD. 
13.2 Progressive disease (PD)  
If radiologic imaging verifies initial disease progression per RECIST 1.1  or 
recurrence after surgery, treatment may continue at the discretion of the 
Investigator until repeat imaging ≥6 weeks later.  The Investigator’s decision to 
continue treatment while awaiting repeat imaging should be based on the subject’s 
overall clinical condition guided by the f ollowing criteria:  
• Absence of signs and symptoms indicating disease progression  
• No significant decline in ECOG performance status  
• Absence of rapid progression of disease  
MC1679 59  Amendment 1 
Version date: 21Nov2017  • Absence of progressive tumor at critical anatomical sites (eg, cord compression) 
requiring urgent alternative medical intervention  
If repeat imaging confirms disease progression due to any of the scenarios listed below, patients will be discontinued from study therapy. 
• Non-target disease resulting in initial disease progression is worse (qualitative)  
• New lesion resulting in initial disease progression is worse (qualitative)  
• Additional new lesion(s) since last evaluation 
In determining whether or not the tumor burden has increased or decreased, Investigators 
should consider all target le sions as well as non -target lesions. When feasible, study 
treatment should not be discontinued until progression is confirmed.  
If the initial docu mented progression is confirmed , patients will go to the event-
monitoring phase until death or a maximum of 5 years post -registration.  
13.3 Off protocol treatment  for reasons other than PD 
Patients who go off protocol treatment for reasons other than PD will go to the 
observation phase for 1 year and then to EM. 
13.4 Observation  
If the patient has achieved CR, PR, or SD, the patient will continue treatment per protocol 
and then observed every 3 months for 1 year. 
13.5 Duration of therapy for CR 
Patients who achieve a CR will complete therapy per protocol . After that, they should be 
observed (see 13.4 above) ever y 3 months for 1 year  and proceed to event monitoring . If 
they develop PD  during observation, then t hey will proceed  to event monitoring. 
13.6 Duration of therapy for PR or SD 
Patients who are in PR or SD will continue on therapy per protocol. Subsequent treatment is at the discretion of their attending physician  
13.7 CNS PD  
Patients who develop PD in the CNS may  receive whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) or 
gamma -knife radiotherapy and will be considered to have PD and proceed to EM. 
13.8 Non-CNS PD   
Patients who develop non-CNS PD at any time should go to event monitoring. 
These patients should be treated with alternative chemotherapy if their clinical status is good enough to allow further therapy.  
13.9b Definition of Ineligible  
A patient is d eemed ineligible  if after registration, it is determined that at the time of 
registration, the patient did not satisfy each and every eligibility criteria for study entry. 
The patient may continue treatment off- protocol at the discretion of the physician a s long 
as there are no safety concerns, and the patient was properly registered. The patient will go directly to the event -monitoring phase of the study (or off study, if applicable).  
• If the patient received treatment, all data up until the point of confirmation of 
ineligibility must be submitted. Event monitoring will be required per Section 18.0 of 
the protocol.  
• If the patient never received treatment, on -study material must be submitted. Event 
monitoring will be required per Section 18.0 of the protocol.  
MC1679 60  Amendment 1 
Version date: 21Nov2017  13.9c Definition of Major V iolation  
A patient is deemed a major violation , if protocol requirements regarding treatment in 
cycle 1 of the initial therapy are severely violated that evaluability for primary end point 
is questionable. All data up until the point of confirmation of a major violation must be 
submitted. The patient will go directly to the event-monitoring phase of the study. The 
patient may continue treatment off -protocol at the discretion of the physician as long as 
there are no safety con cerns, and the patient was properly registered. Event monitoring 
will be required per Section 18.0 of the protocol. 
13.9d Definition of Cancel  
A patient is deemed a cancel  if he/she is removed from the study for any reason before 
any study treatment is giv en. On- study material and the End of Active Treatment/Cancel 
Notification Form must be submitted. No further data submission is necessary.

14.4 Background and Methodology 
Blood/blood product samples will be collected for the following research:  
14.41  Blood for correlative research ( ). One 6 ml EDTA tube whole blood and 
one red 10 ml serum tube specimen should be collected per table 14.1 for 
analysis of circulatin g MDSCs and other circulating immune markers. These 
samples will be collected at baseline and after chemoradiation per table 14.1. This 
specimen will only be collected at Mayo Rochester; other site(s) will not 
participate in this portion of the translationa l study. Whole blood should be sent 
to the Dietz Lab, wher e processing will be completed.  
14.43  Blood for correlative research ( ).  One 10 mL whole blood sample 
will be collected in AccuCyte Blood Collection Tubes, which contain the 
proprietary RareCyte cell preservative. These will be collected at baseline, during 
and after chemoradiation per table 14.1. These samples will be shipped or 
delivered immediately at ambient temperature to Mayo Clinic Rochester and then processed through the RareCyte system within three days of collection. CTCs 
will be captured onto glass slides (8 slides per blood sample) for subsequent 
immunofluorescent staining, selection, and single cell isolation.  
Specimens will be collected at the followi ng time points:  
• Baseline   
• Prior to starting third cycle  of pembrolizumab (Cycle 3, Day 1 ±3 days)  
• Following completion of chemoradiation therapy preferably before next dose of 
pembrolizumab 
 

MC1679 63  Amendment 1 
Version date: 21Nov2017  15.0 Drug Information  
15.1 Pembrolizumab (MK-3475, SCH 900475, Keytruda®) 
15.11 Background  
Pembrolizumab is a potent humanized IgG4 monoclonal antibody with high 
specificity of binding to the PD -1 receptor, thus inhibiting its interaction with 
PD-L1 and PD-L2. Based on preclinical  in vitro  data, pembrolizumab has high 
affinity and potent receptor blocking activity for PD -1. 
15.12 Formulation   
Pembrolizumab is available as a liquid 25 mg/mL, 100 mg/vial.  
15.13 Preparation and storage  
Vials should be stored in the refrigerator at te mperatures between 2 -8°C.  
Drug concentrate is further diluted with normal saline (or 5% dextrose in the concentration range of 1 to 10 mg/mL) in IV containers made of polyvinyl 
chloride (PVC) or non -PVC material. The infusion solution in the IV bag should 
be immediately administered. Pembrolizumab solutions may be stored at room temperature for a cumulative period of up to 4 hours. This includes room 
temperature storage of reconstituted solution in vials, room temperature storage 
of infusion solution in the IV bag and the duration of infusion. 
In addition, IV bags may be stored at 2 -8 °C for up to a cumulative time of 20 
hours. If refrigerated, the vials and/or IV bags should be allowed to equilibrate to 
room temperature prior to subsequent use.  
15.14 Administration  
Pembrolizumab is administered by intravenous infusion over 30 minutes via a 0.22 micron in-line filter. The final infusion volume must be between 1 and 10 
mg/mL. Maximum rate of infusion should not exceed 6.7 mL/minute through a 
peripheral or indwelling catheter. Flush the line with 0.9% NaCL following the 
completion of the infusion.  
15.15 Pharmacokinetic information  
a) Absorption – S teady state is predicted to be acheived  after ~18  weeks of 
repeated dosing, with ~2.2- fold accumulation in exposure during administration 
Q3W relative to exposure observed following singl dose administration. The 
majority (~81%) of this accumulation has occurred by the fourth dose. In the 
dose rane studied for efficacy (2 to 10 mg/kg), pembrolizumab exposure incre ases in a dose-proportional manner, with clearance being independent of 
time or pembrolizumab concentration. b) Distribution – Pembrolizumab has a limited volume of distribution.  
c) Excretion – The systemic clearance of pembrolizumab is ~0.22 L/day and the 
terminal elimination half -life (t½) is estimated to be ~26 days. 
d) Metabolism – Pembrolizumab is catabolized by the general protein 
degradation processes; typical small molecule metabolic pthways (e.g., 
cytochrome P450 enzymes, clucuronosyltransfersases) do not contribute to its 
clearance.  
15.16 Potential Drug Interactions 
There are no known significant drug interactions. 
MC1679 64  Amendment 1 
Version date: 21Nov2017  15.17 Known potential toxicities  
Common known potential toxicities, >10% : 
Dermatologic: Pruritus, skin rash  
Gastrointestinal:diarrhea  
Neuromuscular & skeletal: Arthralgia, back pain  
Respiratory: Cough 
Less common known potential toxicities, 1% - 10%: 
Infustion related reactions  
Dermatologic: vitiligo, severe skin reactions  
Endocrine & metabolic: Hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, hyponatremia 
Gastrointestinal: Colitis , abdominal pain 
Respiratory:  Pneumonitis 
Rare known potential toxicities, <1% (Limited to important or life-
threatening):  
Secondary a drenocortical insufficiency (immune -mediated), hepatitis (including 
autoimmune hepatitis), hypophysitis, nephritis, Guillain -Barre  syndrome 
(immune-mediated), myositis (immune- mediated), pancreatitis (immune -
mediated), uveitis (immune -mediated) , and Type I diabetes mellitus.  
Two important potential risks have been identified, although the data available 
thus far for these events does not provide sufficient evidence of a causal 
relationship to pembrolizumab. The two important potential risks are: a) 
myasthenic syndrome, and b) an increased risk of severe complications (such as 
early severe graft versus host disease and venoocclusive disease) of allogeneic transplant in patients with hematologic malignancies who have previously been 
treated with PD -1 inhibitors. The Sponsor continues to monitor and collect data 
on these potential risks in order to further characterize their potential relationship to pembrolizumab.  
Two important updates from additional information from the clinical trial and 
post- marketing envi ronments include:  a) A new important risk of myocarditis.  
Cases with fatal outcome have been reported. b) Further characterization of the existing important identified risk of severe skin reactions to include cases of 
Stevens- Johnson syndrome (SJS) and t oxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), some 
with fatal outcome.  
15.18 
Drug procurement  
Pembrolizumab will be provided free of charge to study participants by Merck.  
15.19 Nursing Guidelines  
15.191 Pembrolizumab side effects vary greatly from those of traditional  
chemotherapy and can vary in severity from mild to life threatening. 
Instruct patients to report any side effects to the study team immediately. Side effects may be immediate or delayed up to months 
after discontinuation of therapy. Most side effects are reversible with 
prompt intervention of corticosteroids. 
15.192 Diarrhea can be seen however, is less common than that seen with anti -
CTLA- 4 agents. However it can be severe, leading to colonic 
perforation. Instruct patients to report ANY increase in the number of 
MC1679 65  Amendment 1 
Version date: 21Nov2017  stools and/or change in baseline, blood in the stool, abdominal pain to 
the study team immediately.  
15.193 Rash/ pruritis /dermatitis is seen. Patients should report any rash to the 
study team. Treat per Section 9.0  and monitor for effectiveness.  
15.194 Monitor LFTs closely as elevations in these levels could indicate early onset autoimmune hepatitis. Patients should also be instructed to report any jaundice, or right upper quadrant pain to the study team 
immediately.  
15.195 Pneumonitis can be seen and may be mild (only seen on imaging) to 
severe. Patients should be instructed to report any SOB, dyspnea, 
cough, chest pain, etc. to the study team immediately. Patients reporting these symptoms should have a pulse ox checked and consider 
immediate imaging per the treating MD.  
15.196 Endocrinopathies (including hypopituitarism, hypothyroidism, 
hypophysitis, and adrenal insufficiency) are seen with this agent. 
Patients may present only with the vague sense of fatigue and “not 
feeling well.” Additional symptoms may be that of nausea, sweating 
and decreased activity tolerance. Instruct patients to report these signs or symptoms immediately and obtain appropriate labs as ordered by 
MD. 
15.197 Patients who are started on steroid therapy for any side effects of 
pembrolizumab toxicity should be instructed to take the steroids as 
ordered, and not to discontinue abruptly as symptoms may return and be severe. Patients may be on steroid therapy for weeks. Instruct  
patients to report any increase or change in side effects with any dosage decrease as patients may need a slower taper.  
15.198 Fatigue is common and may or may not be associated with immune 
related side effects. Assess patient’s fatigue level prior to each cycle of 
therapy and report any changes to the study team. 
15.199a Patients should avoid receiving live vaccines within 30 days of study drug administration or per other study guidelines.  
15.199b Patients who have undergone an allogenic bone marrow t ransplant, 
have an increased risk of severe complications including early GVHD, and venoocclusive disease, if they have previously been treated with 
pembrolizumab 
15.199c Myocarditis has been reported and associated with pembrolizumab. 
Instruct patients to  report chest pain, SOB, or dyspnea to study team 
immediately and/or seek emergency medical attention.  
  
MC1679 66  Amendment 1 
Version date: 21Nov2017  15.2 Doxorubicin 
15.21 Background: 
Doxorubicin inhibits DNA and RNA synthesis by intercalation between DNA 
base pairs by inhibition of topoisomerase II and be steric obstruction. 
Doxorubicin intercalates at points of local uncoiling of the double helix. 
Although the exact mechanism is unclear, it appears that direct binding to DNA (intercalation) and inhibition of DNA repair (topoisomerase II inhibition)  result 
in blockade of DNA and RNA synthesis and fragmentation of DNA. Doxorubicin is also a powerful iron chelator; the iron-doxorubicin complex can bind DNA and 
cell membranes and produce free radicals that immediately cleave the DNA and 
cell membranes.

CYP2B 6 (moderate), 2D6 (weak), 3A4 (weak)  
Increased Effect/Toxicity: Bevacizumab, trastuzumab, and cyclophosphamide 
may enhance the cardiotoxic effect of doxorubicin. Docetaxel and paclitaxel may 
enhance the adverse/toxic effect of doxorubicin; may increase th e serum 
concentration of doxorubicin and may also increase the formation of toxic 
doxorubicin metabolites in heart tissue. Cyclosporine and sorafenib may increase 
the levels/effects of doxorubicin. CYP2D6 inhibitors may increase the 
levels/effects of doxor ubicin. CYP3A4 inhibitors may increase the levels/effects 
of doxorubicin. Doxorubicin may increase the levels/effects of CYP2B6 
substrates.  
Decreased Effect: Digoxin may diminish the cardiotoxic effect of doxorubicin. Doxorubicin may decrease the absorption and serum concentration of cardiac 
glycosides. CYP3A4 inducers may decrease the levels/effects of doxorubicin.  
Herb/Nutraceutical Interactions : Avoid St. John’s wort (may decrease 
doxorubicin levels). Avoid black cohosh, dong quai in estrogen-dependent 
tumors.

commercial supply chain or wholesaler.  
  
MC1679 68  Amendment 1 
Version date: 21Nov2017  15.29 Nurs ing Guidelines:  
15.291 Check CBC and platelet counts.  Instruct patient to watch for signs of 
infection, bleeding, and anemia. 
15.292 Advise patient that their urine may turn pink in color for approximately 
24 hours after administration of the drug. 
15.293 Adriamycin is a vesicant .  Check IV patency before and frequently 
during administration.  If extravasation occurs, refer to institutional 
guidelines. 
15.294 Hair loss occurs 2 -4 weeks after initial injection and can be complete. 
Regrowth begins 2-3 months after discontinuation. 
15.295 Beware of Adria “flare” that can occur during administration.  The 
reaction consists of an erythematous streak up the vein receiving the 
infusion.  Adjacent veins may also demonstrate red streaks.  Urticaria 
and pruritus can be associated with the reaction.  The use of 
corticosteroids and/or antihistamines has been helpful.  
15.296 Administer antiemetics to minimize nausea and vomiting.  
15.297 Assess for alterations in mucous membranes. Stomatitis occurs within 7-10 days after  injection.  It begins with burning sensation and can 
progress to ulceration, which can last 3 days. Carafate slurry may be 
useful. Adequate nutritional counseling is important. Topical 
anesthetics such as viscous Xylocaine can be used symptomatically.  
15.298 Advise patient that there is often significant malaise and fatigue  
1-2 weeks after injection.  
15.299a Adriamycin may potentiate toxicity of other antineoplastic therapies. It 
has reportedly exacerbated Cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan, CTX) induced hemorrhag ic cystitis.  
15.299b Assess heart and lung sounds.  Monitor vital signs (resting pulse). Be alerts to early signs of cardiotoxicity, i.e., dyspnea, steady weight gain, nonproductive cough, arrhythmias, tachycardia, and pulmonary rales. 
Instruct patients to  report any of these signs or symptoms to their 
health care provider. 
15.299c Document cumulative dose, which should not exceed maximum 
cumulative dose. 
15.299d Advise patient of probable facial flushing for several hours after drug administration, especially if given quickly.  
  
MC1679 69  Amendment 1 
Version date: 21Nov2017  15.3 Docetaxel (Taxotere®, TATER)  
15.31 Background 
Antineoplastic Agent, Antimicrotubular, Taxane derivative. Docetaxel promotes 
the assembly of microtubules from tubulin dimers, and inhibits the 
depolymerization  of tubulin which stabilizes microtubules in the cell. This results 
in inhibition of DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis. Most activity occurs during 
the M phase of the cell cycle.  
15.32 Formulation 
Note: Docetaxel is now available as a one- vial formulation in  two 
concentrations: 10 mg/mL and 20 mg/mL. The older formulation included 2 vials which consisted of a concentrated docetaxel vial and a diluent vial, resulting in a reconstituted concentration of 10 mg/mL. Admixture errors could occur due to 
the concentration difference between the new formulations of 10 mg/mL and 20 
mg/mL and the old formulation (10 mg/mL). Do not use the two-vial formulation 
with the one -vial formulation for the same admixture product. 
15.33 Preparation, storage, and stability 
Storage c onditions:
 Store the packaged docetaxel between 2 and 25 °C (36 and 
77°F). Retain in the original package to protect from bright light. Freezing does 
not adversely affect the product.  
One-vial formulation:  Note: One -vial formulation is available in two 
concentrations: 10 mg/mL and 20 mg/mL. Further reconstitution with diluent is 
not required. Further dilute for infusion in 250-500 mL of NS or D 5W in a non-
DEHP container (e.g., glass, polypropylene, polyolefin) to a final concentration of 0.3-0.74 mg/mL. Gently rotate to mix thoroughly. Solutions prepared from the 
one-vial formulation and diluted for infusion should be used within 4 hours of 
preparation (infusion should be completed within 4 hours). 
15.34 Administration  
Administer IV infusion over 1-hour through nonsorbing polyethylene lined (non-DEHP) tubing; in -line filter is not necessary. Note:  Premedication with 
dexamethasone 8 – 10 mg orally twice daily for 3 -5 days, beginning the day 
before docetaxel administration is recommended to decrease the incidence and severity of fluid retention and prevent hypersensitivity reactions and 
pulmonary/peripheral edema. When administered as sequential infusions, taxane 
derivatives should be administered before platinum derivatives (cisplatin, 
carboplatin) to limit myelosuppression and to enhance efficacy. Infusion should 
be completed within 4 hours of final preparation. 
15.35 Pharmacokinetic information  
Docetaxel exhibits linear pharmacokinetics at the recommended dosage range.  
Distribution : Extensive extravascular distribution and/or tissue binding; V
d: 80-
90 L/m2, V dss: 113 L (mean steady state)  
Protein binding:  ~94% to 97%  
Metabolism:  Hepatic; oxidation via CYP3A4 to metabolites  
Half -life elimination:  Terminal: ~11 hours 
Excretion : Feces (~75%, <8% as unchanged drug); Urine ( ~6%)  
  
MC1679 70  Amendment 1 
Version date: 21Nov2017  15.36 Potential Drug Interactions 
Cytochrome P450 Effect: Substrate  (major) of CYP3A4; Inhibits  CYP3A4 
(weak).  
Increased Effect/Toxicity: CYP3A4  inhibitors may increase the levels/effects of 
docetaxel. Concomitant use of docetaxel with a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor should 
be avoided. If systemic administration of a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor cannot be avoided, a 50% reduction in docetaxel dose should be considered along with 
close monitoring for docetaxel toxicity. Refer to the package insert or LexiComp
1 
for example inhibitors. When administered as sequential infusions, observational studies indicate a potential for increased toxicity when platinum derivatives 
(carboplatin, cisplatin) are administered before taxane  derivatives (docetaxel, 
paclitaxel). Taxane derivatives may enhance the adverse/toxic effect of 
anthracyclines.  
Decreased Effect: CYP3A4 inducers may decrease the levels/effects of paclitaxel. Refer to the package insert or LexiComp
1 for example inducers.  
Ethanol/ Herb/Nutraceutical Interactions : Avoid ethanol (due to GI irritation). 
Avoid St John’s wort (may decrease docetaxel levels).  
Immunosuppressants : (ex: denosumab, pimecrolimus, tacrolimus, etc.) 
docetaxel may enhance the adverse/toxic effect of immunosuppressants (risk for serious infections may increase)  
Myleosuppressived Agents: increased risk of agranulocytosis and/or pancytopenia (ex: clozapine, dipyrone) 
BCG :  Immunosuppressants may diminish the therapeutic effect of BCG 
Treatment with Docetaxel  Products May Cause Symptoms of Alcohol 
Intoxication June 2014  
The FDA is warning health care providers and patients that docetaxel injection 
products contain ethanol, which may cause patients to experience symptoms of 
alcohol intoxication during and afte r treatment. The FDA is revising the labels of 
all docetaxel drug products to warn about this risk. Health care providers should 
consider the alcohol content of docetaxel products when prescribing or 
administering the drug to patients, particularly in those whom alcohol intake 
should be avoided or minimized and when using it in conjunction with other 
medications. Patients should avoid driving, operating machinery, or performing other activities that are dangerous for one to two hours after docetaxel infusio n. 
15.37 Known potential adverse events 
Consult the package insert for the most current and complete information. 
Percentages reported for docetaxel Monotherapy; frequency may vary depending 
on diagnosis, dose, liver function, prior treatment, and premedication. The incidence of adverse events was usually higher in patients with elevated liver 
function tests.

15.38 Nursing guidelines 
15.381 Monitor CBC closely, as neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia are 
common and may be life threatening, and dose limiting.  Instruct 
patient to report any signs or symptoms of infection, any unusual 
bruising, or bleeding.  
15.382 Administer antiemetics as ordered. Evaluate for their effectiveness.  
15.383  Monitor for signs/symptoms of hypersensitivity reactions that may 
include chi lls, rigors, dyspnea, bronchospasms, etc.  Stop infusion 
immediately and administer proper emergency treatment. 
15.384 Because of the risk of anaphylaxis and development of edema, instruct patient that is imperative to take steroid premedications as ordered. 
Decrease in steroids has been recommended in this protocol. Please 
follow guidelines as mentioned in Section 9.5
. 
15.385 Instruct patient on proper oral care, as mucositis may occur.  
15.386 Advise patient about alopecia.  
15.387 Monitor liver function tests. 
MC1679 72  Amendment 1 
Version date: 21Nov2017  15.388 Drug is a vesicant.  Monitor infusion site frequently for signs of 
irritation or infiltration.  Drug extravasation causes acute streaking, 
burning pain, and discoloration at the site.  Skin may be reddened for 
several weeks and occasionally blister and/or peel.  Reactions are 
usually reversible over time.   Because of this central venous access 
may be necessary.  Discuss with MD if patient has poor peripheral venous access.  If docetaxel concentrate or dilut ed solution comes into 
contact with skin, wash with soapy water immediately.  If it comes into contact with mucosa, wash with warm water immediately.  
15.389a Instruct patient to report any signs of peripheral neuropathy to the 
health care team (pain, numbness, tingling).  
15.389b Monitor for signs and symptoms of fluid retention, weight gain, ascites 
and CHF. 
15.389c Instruct patient about possible facial flushing, rash, and skin and nail 
changes.  Monitor for signs and symptoms of hand/foot syndrome. Howeve r premedication with steroids can minimize this side effect.  
Discuss with MD possible ways to manage itching and skin changes that may occur up to a week after docetaxel administration.  Advise patients that nails may crack, peel, or fall off all together. This may be 
a chronic toxicity.  Instruct patient to keep nails clean, short and to 
avoid wearing nail polish or artificial nails.  
15.189d In case of overdose, patient should be hospitalized and vital signs 
monitored.   
 
MC1679 73  Amendment 1 
Version date: 21Nov2017  16.0  Statistical Consider ations and Methodology  
16.1 Statistical Design  
A one stage design with an interim analysis based on the Simon’s optimal design  (Simon 
1989) was chosen to demonstrate efficacy of pembrolizumab in improving overall 
survival in combination with standard chemo-radiotherapy in ATC in comparison to 
historical cohort.  This design will permit early stopping of the trial if there is strong 
evidence that the study regimen is inactive. 
16.11 Primary endpoint 
The primary endpoint is the 6- month overall survival rate  in Cohort A and B 
combined. The 6- month overall survival rate is defined as the total number of 
efficacy evaluable patients who are alive 6 months from registration divided by 
the total number of efficacy evaluable patients enrolled on study. All patients 
meeting the eligibility criteria who ha ve signed a consent form and have begun 
treatment will be evaluable for 6 - month overall survival.  
16.12 Operating Characteristics  
ATC has dismal prognosis and has the historical median OS of 6 months (Goutsouliak and Hay 2005 ; Foote, Molina et al. 2011; Sherman, Lim et al. 
2011) . It is designed as a one- sided test to detect a ≥48.5% reduction of the 
hazard rate associated with overall survival (OS) when compared to historical median OS of 6 months, favoring the addition of pembrolizumab. To evaluate 
ATC, the largest 6 -months overall survival rate where the addition of 
pembrolizumab would be considered ineffective in this population is 50%, and the smallest that would warrant further subsequent studies is 70%. The study 
design proposed below yields an 80% chance of detecting that the 6-month 
overall survival rate is at least 70% at a one-sided 0.2  significance level . 
We will have two cohorts, C ohort A, for patients who will undergo surgery and 
chemoradiation here at Mayo, and Cohort B, patients  in whom surgery is not 
indicated (mostly because of involvement of critical  structures in neck). The 
following decision rule is applied to patients in Cohort A and B combined: 
16.121 Interim Analysis: Enter 10 eligible patients. If more than 6 of the first 
10 evaluable patients enrolled are alive at 6 months then we would 
proceed with accrual. If not, patient accrual will be terminated and the 
regimen would be considered inactive in this patient population 
16.122 Final Analysis : Enter an additional 10 eligible patients. If at least 12 of 
the total 20 evaluable patients enrolled are alive at 6 months, consideration would be given to recommending this treatment for 
further testing in this patient population. If 11 or fewer patients 
enrolled are alive at 6 months, we will consider this regimen 
ineffective in this patient population. 
16.123 Overa ccrual: If more than the target number of patients are accrued, 
the additional patients will not be used to evaluate the stopping rule or 
used in any decision making process.  
16.124 NOTE: The trial will not be halted while the first 10 patient s are 
evaluated for the interim analysis. However, if the accrual is especially 
MC1679 74  Amendment 1 
Version date: 21Nov2017  rapid, we may temporarily suspend accrual to prevent missing 
important acute toxicity patterns.  
16.13 Power and Significance Level 
Assuming that the number of 6-month survivor is binomially distributed, the 
probability of declaring that this regimen warrants further studies (i.e. statistical 
power) under various tumor response rates and the probability of stopping accrual after the first stage can be tabulated as a function of t he true tumor 
response rates as shown in the following table.  
If the true 6 -month survival rate is 45% 50% 55% 60% 65% 70% 75% 
Then the probability of declaring that the 
regimen warrants further study is…  0.10 0.20 0.33 0.50 0.66 0.80 0.91 
And the probability of stopping at the 
completion of stage 1  is…  0.74 0.62 0.50 0.37 0.25 0.15 0.08 
16.14 Sample Size  
A total of 20 evaluable patients will be accrued in Cohort A and B combined per 
study design, unless the study is permanently closed at interim analysis or undue 
toxicity is observed. We anticipate accruing an additional 5 patients in order to 
account for ineligibility, cancellation, major treatmen t violation, or other reasons. 
Therefore, maximum accrual is 25 patients for this trial.  
16.15 Accrual Time and Study Duration 
No similar studies have been conducted for comparison. Based on our anecdotal 
experience from referrals of patients from outside institutions who would 
otherwise fit eligibility criteria we believe we will be able to enroll 1 patient per 
month at our institution (Mayo Clinic). We believe we can complete accrual 
within the proposed 2-year period. 
16.2 Analysis Plan  
16.21 Primary Endpoint 
16.211 Definition: The prima ry endpoint of this trial is the overall survival rate 
at 6 months. This is defined as the proportion of evaluable patients who are alive at 6 months. We consider a success to be alive. All patients 
meeting the eligibility criteria who have signed a consen t form and 
have begun treatment will be considered evaluable.  
16.212 Estimation: The proportion of successes will be estimated by the number of successes divided by the total number of evaluable patients. 
Confidence intervals for the true success proportion will be calculated. 
16.22 Definitions and analyses of secondary clinical endpoint  
Safety and tolerability of pembrolizumab with chemoradiotherapy : All adverse 
events will be graded using the NCI CTCAE Version 4.0. For each type of 
adverse event classified as either possibly, probably, or definitely related to study 
treatment, the proportion of patients experiencing a severe (G rade 3 or higher) 
adverse event will be noted per cycle. The maximum grade for each type of 
adverse event will be recorded  for each patient, and frequency tables will be 
reviewed to determine adverse event patterns.  
MC1679 75  Amendment 1 
Version date: 21Nov2017  16.23  Exploratory endpoints :  
16.231  Numbers of patients with locoregional recurrence and locoregional 
progression in the thyroid bed or regional lymph nodes will be 
summaries using descriptive statistics.  
16.232 Numbers of patients with distant metastasis will be summarized using 
descriptive statistics.  
16.24 Correlative aims:  
16.241 To evaluate the evolution of the immune profile of circulating immune 
cells in response to therapy in ATC patents, and to assess potential 
correlations with outcomes on an exploratory basis. For the  immune 
profile, a plot of the fold change versus response status will be constructed to visually assess differences between those wh ose tumor 
responded to treatment and those whose tumor did not. Wilcoxon rank sum tests will be used to examine whether fold changes in a given 
immune profile differs between whose tumor responded to treatment 
and those whose tumor did not. 
16.242 To determine if pre-therapy circulating tumor cell load might predict 
response and recurrence. Wilcoxon rank sum tests will be used to examine whether the pre -therapy circulating tumor cell load differs 
between whose tumor responded to treatment and those whose tumor did not, and between those who had recurrence versus who did not.  
16.242 To evaluate ATC PD -1 and PDL-1 staining in tumor cells and tumor 
stroma as candidate biomarkers for prognostic and/or response in ATC. Wilcoxon rank sum tests will be used t o examine whether PD-1 and 
PD L -1 staining differs between whose tumor responded to treatment 
and those whose tumor did not. 
16.242 To examine associations between tumor response and somatic 
mutational status in archived tumors, a 95% confidence interval f or the 
difference in proportion of patients who have a documented tumor 
response among those with that particular biomarker present and 
proportion of patients who have a documented tumor response among 
those without that particular biomarker present. 
16.3 Reporting and Exclusions 
16.31 Evaluation of adverse events.  
All subjects will be evaluable for adverse events from the time of their first 
treatment with pembrolizumab. 
16.32 Evaluation of response.  
All subjects included in the study must be assessed fo r response to treatment, 
even if there are major protocol treatment deviations or if they are ineligible. 
Each subject will be assigned one of the following categories: 1) complete 
response, 2) partial response, 3) stable disease, 4) progressive disease, 5 ) early 
death from malignant disease, 6) early death from toxicity, 7) early death because of other cause, or 9) unknown (not assessable, insufficient data). [ Note: By 
arbitrary convention, Category 9 usually designates the “unknown” status of any type of data in a clinical database.]  
MC1679 76  Amendment 1 
Version date: 21Nov2017  All of the subjects who met the eligibility criteria (with the possible exception of 
those who received no study medication) should be included in the main analysis 
of the response rate. Subjects in response categories 4 -9 should be considered to 
have a treatment failure (disease progression). Thus, an incorrect treatment schedule or drug administration does not result in exclusion from the analysis of 
the response rate. Precise definitions for categories 4 -9 will be protocol s pecific.  
All conclusions should be based on all eligible subjects. Subanalyses may then be 
performed on the basis of a subset of subjects, excluding those for whom major 
protocol deviations have been identified (e.g., early death due to other reasons, 
early discontinuation of treatment, major protocol violations, etc.). However, 
these subanalyses may not serve as the basis for drawing conclusions concerning 
treatment efficacy, and the reasons for excluding subjects from the analysis 
should be clearly reported. The 95% confidence intervals should also be 
provided.  
16.4 Monitoring 
The principal investigator and the study statistician will review the study periodically to 
identify accrual, toxicity, and any endpoint problems that might be developing. In 
addition, this study will be monitored according to the Mayo Clinic Cancer Center (MCCC) Data Safety Monitoring Plan that is currently in place. The MCCC Data Safety 
Monitoring Board (DSMB) is responsible for reviewing safety data for this trial at least 
twice a year, based on reports provided by the MCCC Statistical Office.  
16.41 Adverse Event Stopping Rules 
NOTE: NCI CTCAE v4.0 will be used to determine grading for adverse event stopping rules. The AE stopping rule will be applied to pat ients in C ohorts A and 
B combined. 
After first five patients are enrolled the enrollment will be suspended until all 
5 patients complete chemoradiation. After the first 5 p atient s, if we see three or 
more  patients develop any immune -related adverse events attributed  to th e 
study drug (“possible”, “probable” and “definite” only) leading to permanent  
discontinuation of the chemoradiation  then further enrollment will be 
suspended . 
NOTE: Autoimmune thyroiditis is allowed. 
16.5 Results Reporting on ClinicalTrials.gov 
At study activation, this study will have been registered within the “ClincialTrails.gov” 
website. The Primary and Secondary Endpoints along with other required information for 
this study will be reported on www.Clinica lTrials.gov
. For purposes of timing of the 
Results Reporting, the initial estimated completion date for the Primary Endpoint of this study is 3 years after the study opens to accrual. The definition of “Primary Endpoint Completion Date” (PECD) for this study is at the time the last patient registered has been 
followed for at least 6 months.  
16.6 Subset Analyses for Minorities:  
16.61 Study availability  
This study will be available to all eligible patients, regardless of gender, race or ethnic origin.  
  
MC1679 77  Amendment 1 
Version date: 21Nov2017  16.62 Statistical analysis by subset  
There is no information currently available regarding differential effects of this 
regimen in subsets defined by race, gender, or ethnicity, and there is no reason to 
expect such differences to exist. Therefore, although t he planned analyses will 
look for differences in treatment effect based on racial groupings, the sample size is not increased in order to provide additional power for subset analyses.  
16.63 Regional population 
The geographical region served by MCCC has a population which includes approximately 3% minorities. Based on prior MCCC studies involving similar 
disease sites, we expect about 3 -5% of patients will be classified as minorities by 
race and about 33% of patients will be women. Expected sizes of racial by 
gender subsets are shown in the following table:

17.4 Background and Methodology 
ATCs have a high mutation burden, that when combined with chemoradiation, may lead 
to the elaboration of tumor neoantigens, thereby inducing susceptibility to anti-tumor 
immune responses following pembrolizumab therapy. Moreover, ATCs often develop from di fferentiated thyroid cancers (DTC), the latter of which are often associated, at 
least initially, with clinical and/or subclinical autoimmune thyroid disease (i.e. an anti-thyroid response).  In DTCs, co-existent autoimmune thyroid disease, outcomes are 
generally favorable, suggesting an intact anti- thyro id/anti-tumor immune response. As 
DTCs progress to PDTC and ATCs, tumors become heavily infiltrated with TAMs that, 
together with acquired intrinsic tumor cell genetic alterations, promote an immune-
suppressive tumor microenvironment that permits rapid tumor progression. 
We hypothesize that the dynamic alterations in circulating and tumor infiltrating immune 
cell subtypes before and following chemoradiation plus pembrolizumab will inform 
clinical outcomes. T his information will be used then as biomarkers to identify 
responders to pembrolizumab as well as to develop novel immune based combination 
strategies to overcome resistance among the non -responders. 
17.41 Immunohistochemical studies  
Immunohistochemical s tudies will be performed on FFPE sections pre and post 
pembrolizumab therapy to examine alterations in : 1) tumor infiltrating immune 
cells (i.e. T cells,  TAMs, NK cells , DCs ); 2) expression of MHC class expression  
proteins; 3) PD -1 and PD -L1 expression ; 4) Ki67 proliferation index; and 
5) apoptosis markers.  
17.42 Gene expression studies  
Alterations in t issue-derived immune signatures through gene expression studies 
will be evaluated during the course of therapy to identify immune phenotypes 
associated with  tumor responses and/or those associated with resistance to 
therapies. For example, altered cytokine expression levels, may induce and/or 
impair anti-tumor immune responses which can be used to identify responders as 
well as to develop novel immune therapy combinations for non-responders.  
  
MC1679 81  Amendment 1 
Version date: 21Nov2017  17.43 Thyroid autoantibody screens 
ATCs often develop from differentiated thyroid cancers (DTC), the latter of 
which are often associated, at least initially, with clinical and/or subclinical 
autoimmune thyroi d disease (i.e. an anti -thyroid response).  In DTCs co -existent 
with autoimmune thyroid disease, overall outcomes are reportedly favorable from 
limited studies, suggesting the presence of an intact  anti-tumor immune response. 
As DTCs progress, however, to PDTC and A TCs, tumors be come heavily 
infiltrated with TAMs, that together with acquired intrinsic tumor cell gen etic 
alterations, promote an immunosuppressive tumor environment and tumor escape 
from host- mediated anti -tumor control. We hypothesize that development of anti -
thyroid antibodies could predict the responders from non-responders when 
treated with pembrolizumab. 
17.44 Circulating tumor cells  
Circulating tumor cells load and decrease in their numbers have been shown to 
be prognostic markers in many cancers in cluding breast (Cristofanilli, Budd et al. 
2004; Liu, Shields et al. 2009; Smerage, Barlow et al. 2014) and thyroid cancer (Xu, Handy et al. 2016). However, data from ATC is lacking and we will aim to 
prospectively collect circulating tumor cells and correlate with outcomes. The RareCyte CTC technology is a comprehensive, reproducible and highly sensitive 
dual-platform for collecting, identifying and analyzing CTCs that does not rely 
on EpCAM expression for enrichment. (Campton, Ramirez et al. 2015). This 
platform allows for mechanically precise CTC retrieval, enabling the isolation of 
DNA derived from single or pooled CTCs for advanced genomic analyses including the detection of specific mutations and targeted NGS.

Version date: 21Nov2017  Technical Factors  
External Beam Equipment and Beam Delivery Methods 
Megavoltage equipment capable of delivering  static intensity modulation a multileaf collimator or 
dynamic intensity modulation (using a multileaf collimator or tomotherapy) , including V MAT  is 
required.  
Treatment Planning, Imaging and Localization Requirements 
The immobilization device should at least include the head, neck , and shoulders . It is strongly 
encouraged to use a customized head and neck rest, Precise Bite, and indexed hand gr ips.   
Treatment planning CT scans will be required to define gross target volume(s), and clinical target 
volume(s). The treatment planning CT scan should be acquired with the patient in the same 
position and using the same immobilization device as for treatment.  
All tissues, including entire lung volumes (both lungs), to be irradiated must be included in the 
CT scan. CT scan thickness should be ≤0.2 cm slices through the region that contains the primary 
target volumes  including the top of the treatment table superiorly and the entire lung volumes 
inferiorly. 
The GTV and CTV, and normal tissues must be outlined on all CT slices in which the structures 
exist.  
Treatment Planning/Target Volumes  
The definition of volumes will be in accordance with the 1993 ICRU Report #50. 
The Gross Tumor Volume (GTV) is defined as all known gross disease determined from CT, 
MRI, PET/CT,  clinical information, and endoscopic findings. Grossly positive lymph nodes are 
defined as any lymph nodes >1 cm or nodes with a necrotic center. It is strongly encouraged that the radiation oncologist outlines the radiologic extent of the primary tumor and neck nodes along 
with a radiologist. Whenever possible, it is recommended that the diagnostic images be fused to 
the planning CT scan image dataset to more accurately define the GTV. To fur ther subdivide the 
GTV, gross disease at the primary site is designated as GTV -P and clinically involved gross 
lymph nodes are designated GTV-N. In situations where the patient underwent surgery prior to 
radiation therapy , the GTV is defined as the preoperative gross disease plus the post -operative 
surgical bed. 
The Clinical Target Volume (CTV): See the bulleted list below for delineation details.  
For patients without complete surgical resection: In terms of the GTV (GTV -P and GTV -N), a 
margin of ≥ 10 mm sh ould be given circumferentially around the GTV (GTV- P and GTV -N) and 
this volume will be called the CTV 66 (CTV 66-P and CTV 66-N).* This margin can be reduced to 
as low as 1 mm for tumors in close proximity to critical structures, e.g., tumors next to the sp inal 
cord. For regions deemed to be at high risk for microscopic disease, all potential routes of spread 
for primary and nodal GTVs should be delineated by the treating radiation oncologist. This is 
known as CTV for subclinical disease or CTV59.4*  CTVs wi ll not include air or normal adjacent 
organs that have not been invaded (cartilage, bone, brachial plexus, etc.) 
• For patients who have undergone a complete surgical resection: CTV
66 should include the 
preoperative gross disease at the primary disease site or any grossly involved lymph nodes as 
well as the post -operative bed. A CTV 59 4 also can be delineated if the region is at risk for 
microscopic spread and the region has not had surgery. 
• To further define the subclinical region at risk for microscopic spr ead at the primary disease 
site, CTV 59 4-P includes CTV 66-P + ≥5 mm margin and ensuring that the following is 
generously covered: tracheal -esophageal groove, levels II -VI, and upper mediastinal nodes  to

Version date: 21Nov2017  Appendix I V Pembrolizumab ECI Drug -Induced Liver Injury (DILI)  
Hepatotoxicity is injury or damage to the liver that may be associated with impaired liver 
function (Navarro and Senior 2006). Drug-induced hepatotoxicity is one of the most common causes of termination of drug development, a major reason for refusal of market authorization and for restricted use, and the single most important cause of the withdrawal of market authorization for products (Björnsson 2006). Thus, drug-induced hepatotoxicity is a major concern during the discovery, development to postauthorization phases of the product life cycle (excerpted from Draft Guidance Document, Hepatotoxicity of Heal th Products, Ministry of 
Public Health, Canada, December 2010). 
As stated in the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Guidance for Industry - 
Drug -Induced Liver Injury: Premarketing Clinical Evaluation; hepatocellular injury (usually 
detected by serum aminotransferase elevations [AT]) can be caused by drugs that rarely, if ever, cause severe DILI (e.g. aspirin, tacrine, statins, and heparin) as well as by drugs that do cause such injury. The frequency of serum AT elevations also is not a good indicator of a potential for severe DILI, because drugs such as tacrine (not a cause of severe DILI) can cause AT elevations in as many as 50 percent of patients. Very high levels of observed ATs may be a somewhat better indicator of potential for severe DIL I, but the most specific indicator is evidence of altered 
liver function accompanying or promptly following evidence of hepatocellular injury. 
The single clearest (most specific) predictor found to date of a drug’s potential for severe 
hepatotoxicity, is the occurrence of hepatocellular injury (AT elevation) accompanied by increased serum total bilirubin (TBL), not explained by any other cause, such as viral hepatitis or exposure to other hepatotoxins, and without evidence of cholestasis, together with an i ncreased 
incidence of AT elevations in the overall trial population compared to control. Increased plasma prothrombin time, or its international normalized ratio (INR), a consequence of reduced hepatic production of Vitamin K dependent clotting factors, is another potentially useful measure of liver function that might suggest the potential for severe liver injury.  
Recognition of the importance of altered liver function, in addition to liver injury, began with Hyman Zimmerman’s observation that drug -induced hepatocellular injury (i.e. AT elevation) 
accompanied by jaundice (i.e. TBL elevation) had a poor prognosis, with a 10 to 50 percent mortality from acute liver failure (in pretransplantation days) (Zimmerman 1978, 1999). This became known as "Hy's Law". This document describes the recommended process for monitoring and evaluation of subjects meeting the laboratory criteria for potential DILI defined as: 
• an elevated alanine transaminase (ALT) or aspartate transaminase (AST) lab value that is greater 
than or equal to three times (3X) the upper limit of normal  (ULN)  
and 
• an elevated total bilirubin ( TBL ) lab value that is greater than or equal to two times (2X) ULN  
and 
• at the same time, an alkaline phosphatase (ALP) lab value that is less than 2X ULN,  
as a res ult of within -protocol- specific testing or unscheduled testing.  
The protocol identifies these laboratory criteria for potential DILI as ECIs. ECIs are  selected 
adverse experiences that must be reported within 24 hours. 
Initiate close observation  as defined  below and continue follow-up until resolution. 
MC1679 96  Amendment 1 
Version date: 21Nov2017  • Repeat liver enzyme and serum bilirubin tests two (2) or three (3) times weekly. Frequency of 
retesting can decrease to once a week or less if abnormalities stabilize or study drug has been 
discontinued and t he subject is asymptomatic.  
• Obtain a more detailed history of symptoms and prior or concurrent diseases. 
• Obtain a history of concomitant medication use (including prescription and nonprescription 
medications, herbal and other dietary supplements), alcohol use, recreational drug use and special 
diets. (See Section 5 for details.)  
• Obtain a history of exposure to chemical agents or other environmental toxins. 
• Obtain additional history and complete Stage 1 workup to attempt to rule out other potential 
causes of  the transaminase elevation, including but not limited to the following: acute viral 
hepatitis types A, B, C, D, and E; autoimmune or alcoholic hepatitis; non- alcoholic steatohepatitis 
(NASH); hypoxic/ischemic hepatopathy; and biliary tract disease 
• Conside r gastroenterology or hepatology consultation

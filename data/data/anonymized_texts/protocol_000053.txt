Name of product:  Carfilzomib for Injection  
Title of study and protocol number 
and phase:  A Randomized, Open -label, Phase 3 Study in Subjects with Relapsed and 
Refractory Multiple Myeloma Receiving Carfilzomib in Combination with Dexamethasone, Comparing Once -week ly versus Twice -weekly Carfilzomib 
Dosing / 20140355  
Study objective(s):  Primary Objective  
To compare the progression -free survival  (PFS) of once -weekly carfilzomib 
dosing in combination with dexamethasone to  the PFS of twice -weekly 
carfilzomib dosing in  combination with dexamethasone in subjects with relapsed 
and refractory multiple myeloma who have received prior treatment with a 
proteasome inhibitor  and an IMiD (immunomodulatory agent).   
Secondary Objectives  
To compare the following between treatment groups:  
• Overall response rate ( ORR) 
• Overall survival (OS)  
• Safety and tolerability  
• Pharmacokinetics (PK) of carfilzomib using sparse sampling  
Exploratory Objectives  
• Intensive pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PDn) of carfilzomib in a subset of su bjects (substudy)  
• All subscales of the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Core Module (QLQ -C30), and the EORTC 
Quality of Life Multiple Myeloma Module 20 (QLQ -MY20)  
• European Quality of Life -5 Dimensions (EQ -5D- 5L); a standardized 
measure of health status developed by the European Quality of Life 
(EuroQol) Group  
• Patient reported convenience and satisfaction with the carfilzomib schedule  
• Healthcare resource utilization  
Study design:  This is an open -label, multicenter, randomized Phase 3 study comparing 
carfilzomib dosing in combination with dexamethasone administered once -weekly 
to twice -weekly carfilzomib dosing in subjects with relapsed and refractory 
multiple myeloma, previously treated with a proteasome inhi bitor  and an IMiD.  
The primary endpoint is PFS.  The study design is illustrated in the schema below.  
Eligible subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive a regimen consisting 
of either once -weekly or twice -weekly carfilzomib in combination with 
dexamethasone.   
The randomization will be stratified by:  
• The International Staging System (ISS) at study entry (Stage  1 versus 
Stage  2 or 3) per International Myeloma Working Group  (Greipp  2005).   
See Appendix  H 
• Refractory to bortezomib treatment (Yes versus No) 
• Age (<  65 versus ≥  65 years)

Study design 
(cont’d):  Study treatment will be administered in 28 -day cycles.  Subjects will receive study 
treatment determined by randomization until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or d eath (whichever occurs first).  No crossover 
between the 2  treatment groups will be allowed.  
Following termination of study treatment all subjects will be followed for disease status (if progressive disease [PD] has not been reached), subsequent antimyelom a 
treatment, and survival.  All subjects will be followed for safety at least 30 
additional days after the last study treatment administration.  All treatment -related 
adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) will be followed until resolution or stabilization.   
Study 20140355 Schema 
 
 
 
 
  
 
  
 
  
 
  
 
  
 
ECOG = Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group; IMiD = immunomodulatory agents; 
IV = intravenous(ly); ORR = overall respon se rate; OS = overall survival;  
PD = progressive disease; PFS = progression-f ree survival; PI = proteasome inhibitor; 
PO = orally . 
Subjects will be assessed for response using central laboratory results  every 
28 days (±  4 days).  Subjects are followed for disease status until confirmed PD.  
Long- term follow -up (LTFU) for disease st atus (only in cases where subjects 
discontinued treatment prior to PD) and for survival (after reaching PD) will 
continue after treatment discontinuation or until the subject has withdrawn consent for further participation, is lost to follow -up, has died, or the sponsor makes a 
decision to close the study.  For subjects who discontinued treatment before disease progression occurred (such as for an adverse event, noncompliance, etc.), disease response assessments will be performed using central laboratory results every 28 days  until disease progression.  Follow -up for survival will continue 
approximately every 12 weeks ±  28 days , or as needed, for all surviving subjects 
until study closure.  For any subject who is lost to follow -up, the study site will 
attemp t to ascertain survival information via public database search.

Efficacy 
variables:   The primary endpoint is PFS.   
Secondary endpoints are: ORR, overall survival (OS), safety  and tolerability, and 
pharmacokinetics (s parse sampling) (PK).   
Disease assessments according to the International Myeloma Working Group -Uniform Response Criteria (IMWG -URC) will be conducted at baseline 
and then every 28  days (± 4  days)  thereafter until progression.  
PK (sparse 
sampling)  For both arms, blood samples will be collected from subjects who consent to the additional testing except for those participating in the intensive PK/PDn substudy for determination of plasma concentrations of carfilzomib on C2D1.   
Intensive PK and PDn Substudy  Intensive pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PDn) samples will be obtained as a substudy (approximately n  = 15 evaluable subjects  in each arm) 
from subjects who consent to the additional testing at selected sites.  Pharmacokinetic samples will be collected on Day  15 of Cycle  1 and PDn samples 
will be collected on Days  1, 15, 16, 17, and 22 of Cycle  1.   
Health related Quality of Life (HRQL):  The following patient reported outcomes (PRO) will be collected in the study:  
• The EORTC 30 -item QLQ -C30 que stionnaire  
• The EORTC 20 -item QLQ -MY20 module specifically designed to address 
the quality of life for those with multiple myeloma  
• The EQ -5D-5L and patient reported convenience and satisfaction 
questionnaire  
QLQ -C30, QLQ -MY20 , and EQ -5D-5L questionnaires sh ould be administered 
prior to study treatment on Day  1 of Cycle  1, then every second cycle  (Cycle 1, 3, 
5, etc)  during treatment and every 12 weeks (every 84  days ± 4 days) until 
progression, or withdrawal of consent during LTFU .  Patient convenience and 
satisfaction questionnaire  will be collected at Day 1  Cycle  2 and end of treatment 
(EOT ) only.  Healthcare resource utilization will be collected for all subjects 
during the study.   Details on hospitalizations (not related to adver se events ) will 
also be co llected.

Safety variables:   Safety and tolerability will be assessed by incidence and severity of adverse 
events and changes from baseline of all relevant parameters, including laboratory values, physical examination, vital signs , and electrocardiogram ( ECG).  Severity 
of adverse events will be assessed according to the National Cancer Institute -Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI -CTCAE), 
Version 4.03.  All subjects will be monitored for adverse events for at least 30 days after the last administration of study treatment.   
Statistical 
methods and 
analyses:  Efficacy analyses will be based on the ITT (Intent -To-Treat) Population, which 
includes all randomized subjects.   
The primary endpoint, PFS, will be calculated from the time of randomi zation 
until PD or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first.  If a subject is 
alive or lost to follow -up without experiencing documented disease 
progression  by the data cutoff date, the PFS data for the subject will be 
censored at the date of last va lid disease and response assessment.  The 
distribution of PFS will be estimated using the Kaplan- Meier method.  The 
inferential comparison between treatment groups will be made using the log-rank test stratified by the randomization stratification factors.   The HR 
and its 95% CI will be estimated using a Cox proportional hazards model stratified by the same randomization stratification factors.    
The following  randomization stratification factors will be included in the model:  
• The ISS Stage at study entry ( Stage  1 versus Stage  2 or 3)  
• Refractory to bortezomib treatment (Yes versus No) 
• Age (<  65 versus ≥  65 years)  
Response and disease progression will be determined using a validated computer algorithm (Onyx Response Computational Assessment [ORCA]), 
as well as by local investigators and by an Independent Review Committee 
(IRC).  The prim ary analysis of PFS will be based on ORCA -assessed 
outcomes.  The PFS outcomes assessed by the investigator will serve as a supportive analysis of PFS, as will IRC -assessed outcomes.   
The secondary endpoint ORR is defined as the proportion of subjects 
achieving a best overal l response of PR, very good partial response (VGPR), 
complete response (CR), or stringent complete response (sCR), based on the 
IMWG -URC.   The ORR will be calculated by treatment group , and the 
associated 95% confidence interval [CI] wi ll be estimated using the 
Clopper -Pearson method.  The odds ratio (and its 95% CI) will be estimated using 
the logistic regression model.   
The duration of response (DOR), defined as time in months from the start date of 
the response to the earlier date of  documented PD or death, will be calculated for 
subjects who achieve PR, VGPR, CR or sCR.  The DOR will be censored at date of the last valid assessment for responders who have not experienced PD or death.  
The distribution of the DOR, including the median will be estimated using the 
Kaplan -Meier method based on the subjects who achieve overall response.   
The secondary endpoint of OS will be analyzed using the log- rank test stratified 
by the randomization stratification factors.  The cor responding HRs  will be 
estimated using a stratified Cox proportional hazards model.  The distribution of OS including medians will be summarized using the Kaplan -Meier method.

2 BACKGROUND INFORMATION 
2.1 INTRODUCTION 
Carfilzomib for Injection received accelerated approval from the United States Food and 
Drug Admi nistration ( US FDA) in July 2012 for the treatment of patients with multiple 
myeloma who have received at least 2 prior therapies, including bortezomib and an 
immunomodulatory agent (IMiD) and have demonstrated disease progression on or 
within 60 days  of completion of the last therapy.  The approval was based on the results 
of the Study PX-171-003 – Part 2 (A1) in 266 subjects with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma.    
Per the 2012 approved label, carfilzomib is administered intravenously (IV) over 
10 minutes , on 2 consecutive days  each week for 3 weeks ( Days  1, 2, 8, 9, 15, and 16 of a 
28-day cycle).  The recommended Cycle  1 dose is 20 mg/m
2/day with an  increase to 
27 mg/m2 on Cycle  2 Day 1 onwards.   
This study will assess the superiority of a higher dose level of carfilzomib (70 mg/m2) 
given once- weekly ( Days  1, 8, and 15) over 30 minutes in combination with 
dexam ethasone compared to the twice-weekly regimen at 20/27 mg/m2 in combination 
with dexam ethasone .  Subjects will receive the study treatment determined by 
randomization until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or mortality (whichever occurs first).  Subjects will be evaluated in long -term follow -up 
(LTFU) for health status and survival.   
2.2 MULTIPLE MYELOMA  
Multip le myeloma, a clonal neoplastic proliferation of plasma cells, is the second most 
common hematologic malignancy and accounts for approximately 72,000 annual deaths 
worldwide ( Ferlay  2010) .  There are an estimated 11,0 00 deaths per year in the US and 
more than 19,000 deaths per year in Europe (American  Cancer  Society  2014; 
Boyle  2005).  Multiple myeloma is characterized by anemia, bon e destruction, 
monoclonal gammopathy, renal failure, hypercalcemia, and increased susceptibility to infections.  The disease is systemic and chemotherapy is indicated for management of 
symptomatic myeloma.

Historically, multiple myeloma was treated with chemotherapy with the introduction of 
melphalan in the 1960s.  Subsequent treatment paradigms for the next three decades 
relied largely on combination of chemotherapy regimens with corticosteroids, with 
minimal to no incremental improvements in survival.  In the 1990s, the introduction of 
autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) after a conditioning regimen that incorporates high doses of melphalan resulted in improvements in survival.  Additional 
improvements in survival followed the advent of the IMiDs, thalidomide (Thalomid) and 
lenalidomide (Revlimid) and the proteasome inhibitor (PI) bortezomib (Velcade) 
(Kumar  2008).  Since then, these 3 agents have been used in combination with 
corticosteroids, and with chemotherapy agents (e.g., alkylating agents) (National 
Comprehensive Cancer Network 2014; Harousseau 2010).   
Despite improvements in progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS), 
patients  who have received several lines of prior therapy experience progressively lower 
rates and durations of response as resistance emerges (Kumar  2004; Durie  2012; 
Kumar  2012) ; and current therapeutic options for patients who have multiply relapsed  
and refractory disease, especially those refractory to both IMiDs and bortezomib, are limited.  A recent retrospectiv e review of 286 patients from treatment centers in the US, 
Europe, and Asia with a median of 4 prior therapies and 3.3 years since initial diagnosis 
of multiple myeloma, revealed that such patients with multiply relapsed multiple 
myeloma can anticipate a median OS of approximately 9 months ( Kumar  2012) .  
2.3 PROTEASOME BACKGROUND 
The proteasome is a multicatalytic proteinase complex that is responsible for degradation 
of a wide variety of protein substrates within normal and m alignant cells.  Intracellular 
proteins targeted for degradation by the proteasome are first ubiquitinated via the ubiquitin conjugation system.  Ubiquitinated proteins are cleaved within the proteasome 
by 1 or more of 3 separate N -terminal threonine prote ase activities: a chymotrypsin -like 
(CT-L) activity, a  trypsin -like activity, and a caspase- like activity . 
2.3.1 
CARFILZOMIB BACKGROUND (NONCLINICAL)  
Carfilzomib (formerly known as P R-171) is a tetrapeptide epoxyketone-based inhibitor of 
the 20S proteasome, prim arily of the CT -L activity , and at higher concentrations, 
Superseding  Amendment  4: 07 March  2017   CONFIDENTIAL  
Onyx Therapeutics, Inc.  Clinical Study Protocol No . 20140355  
Carfilzomib  Page 25 of 165 
of multiple 20S proteolytic activities .  Carfilzomib is a synthetic small molecule peptide 
bearing the chemical name (2S) -N-((S)-1- ((S)-4- methyl-1- ((R)-2- methyloxiran -2-yl) 
-1-oxopentan-2- ylcarbamoy l)-2-phenylethyl) -2-((S)-2- (2-morpholinoacetamido) 
-4-phenylbutanamido)-4- methylpentanamide.  The molecular formula is C 40H57N5O7 and 
the molecular weight is 719.91.  Carfilzomib, which is structurally and mechanistically 
different from the dipeptide boronic acid PI bortezomib, showed less off- target activity 
when measured against a broad panel of proteases including metallo-, aspartyl -, and 
serine proteases compared to bortezomib; the latter showed off- target inhibitory activity 
in the nanomolar range agai nst several serine proteases (Arastu -Kapur 2009).  This 
selectivity may be responsible for the reductions in myelosuppression and neuropathy 
observed in clinical and  nonclinical studies comparing carfilzomib with bo rtezomib.  
Carfilzomib primarily inhibits the CT-L activity of both the constitutive proteasome and 
the immunoproteasome ( Kuhn 2007; Demo  2007).   The importance for co -inhibition of 
multiple proteasome active sites for cytotoxicity ( CT-L, trypsin-like, and/or caspase- like) 
has been demonstrated against multiple myeloma cell lines (Britton  2009; Geurink 2013).  
Nonclinical work supported improved tolerability with increased infusion time, possibly because of the reduced maximum concentration (C
max) with a 30 -minute IV infusion 
(Yang  2011).  Correlative clinical pharmacodynamics (PDn) studies have confirmed that 
longer infusion times and higher doses of carfilzomib resulted in increased proteasome 
inhibition ( Papadopoulos 2014; Lee 2012).  Clinical e vidence for carfilzomib dose 
response has been observed in a multivariable modeling analysis comparing 20 mg/m2 
with 27 mg/m2, (Lonial 2011; Squifflet  2011) suggesting th at more effective inhibition of 
proteasome activity may improve efficacy.  An increased infusion time of 30 minutes  
enabled carfilzomib to be administered at a higher dose, with a maximum tolerated dose 
(MTD) of 56  mg/m2 in Study PX -171-007, compared to 27 mg/m2 over a 2 to 10- minute 
infusion as discussed in Section  2.3.2.  
2.3.2 CARFILZOMIB BACKGROUND (CLINICAL)  
As of 1 0 July 2015, approximately 2921 individual subjects have been treated with 
carfilzomib as participan ts in Onyx -sponsored clinical studies, and 89 subjects have been 
enrolled in studies in Japan sponsored by Ono Pharmaceutical Company.  Approximately 
Superseding  Amendment  4: 07 March  2017   CONFIDENTIAL  
Onyx Therapeutics, Inc.  Clinical Study Protocol No . 20140355  
Carfilzomib  Page 26 of 165 
3549 subjects have been treated with carfilzomib through the 76 completed or actively 
enrolling investigator-sponsored trials (ISTs) ( Carfilzomib IB ). 
There are five Phase 3 studies in multiple myeloma: PX -171-009 (ASPIRE), PX-171-011 
(FOCUS), 2011-003 (ENDEAVOR), 2012- 005 ( CLARION ), and this study, 20140355 
(A.R.R.O.W.).  Additionally , 137 subjects with solid tumors  have been treat ed with 
carfilzomib.  
These trials have explored various doses of carfilzomib either as monotherapy or in combination with other agents and in the majority of studies conducted to date, 
carfilzomib  has been administered on 2 consecutive days  for 3  weeks in a 28 -day cycle .  
Carfilzomib clinical activity has been demonstrated in these studies along with  an 
acceptable safety profile.  
Higher doses of carfilzomib administered on a tw ice-weekly schedule have been studied.  
PX-171-007, a Phase 1b/2 study, was the first to establish the MTD of single agent 
carfilzomib administered as a 30 -minute infusion in subjects  with relapsed and/or 
refractory multiple myeloma  (Papadopolous 2014 ).  Subjects received carfilzomib 
monotherapy on Days  1, 2, 8, 9, 15, and 16 of a 28- day cycle.  Cycle  1 Day  1 and Day 2 
doses were 20  mg/m
2 followed thereafter by dose escalation to 36, 45, 56, or 70 mg/m2.  
Carfilz omib  was administered later with low -dose dexamethasone (40 mg/week)  at the 
45 mg/m2 and 56 mg/m2 dose levels .  Thirty- three subjects were treated , and there were 
dose- limiting toxicities (DLTs) in 2 subjects dosed at 70  mg/m2 of renal tubular necrosis 
(Grade 3) and proteinuria (Grade 3).  The MTD was determined to be 56 mg/m2. 
In the 56 mg/m2 cohort (n = 24), the most common treatment- related adverse events 
(AEs) of any grade were nausea (54.2 %), dyspnea (50.0%), fatigue (45.8%), pyrexia 
(41.7%), and thrombocytopenia and chills (both 37.5%); a majority were Grade 1 or 2.  At this dose, hematologic AEs of thrombocytopenia (37.5%) and anemia (16.7%) were 
the most common treatment- related AEs of ≥ Grade  3.  When carfilzomib at 56 mg/m
2 
was combined with dexamethasone (n = 8), nausea (25%), fatigue (25%), and dyspnea and chills (each 12.5%) occurred less frequently than with carfilzomib alone.  The overall 
response rate (ORR) was 50% in the 56 mg/m
2 cohort where the majority of subjects 
were refractory to IMiDs and bortezomib.  The Phase 2 PX-171-003 – Part  2 (A1) study 
Superseding  Amendment  4: 07 March  2017   CONFIDENTIAL  
Onyx Therapeutics, Inc.  Clinical Study Protocol No . 20140355  
Carfilzomib  Page 27 of 165 
with single agent carfilzomib at 20/27  mg/m2 in a similar population had an ORR 
of 22.9% in the Safety population. 
As evidenced by Study PX -171-007, higher doses of carfilzomib on a twice- weekly 
schedule administered over 30 minutes  were well tolerated and efficacious  with an 
acceptable safety profile.  This led the sponsor to investigate whether higher doses of 
carfilzomib could be tolerated and be efficacious on a more convenient weekly dosing 
schedule in the CHAMPION 1 study as discussed in Section 2.5. 
Additional information on the safety and activity of c arfilzomib is described in the 
Carfilzomib IB . 
2.4 STUDY RATIONALE  
Based on the aspiration of improving the convenience of the currently approved carfilzomib dosing regimen and the recognition that higher doses appeared active and 
tolerable when given over a longer infusion time, a Phase 1b/2 Study CHAMPION 1 was 
initiated to evaluate the safety and efficacy of once- weekly carfilzomib with 
dexamethasone in subjects with relapsed myeloma, who had received 1 to 3 prior therapies.  The dose -escalation portion of the study has identified an MTD of 70 mg/m
2 
administered once-weekly over 30 minutes on Days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28- day cycle.  
Preliminary results from the ongoing Phase  2 portion of this multicenter, single -arm 
study suggested that the dose and regimen of 70 mg/m2 once- weekly appeared  to be well 
tolerated, highly active, and able to  offer a more convenient treatment regimen for 
subjects as discussed in Section 2.5. 
The rationale for this study is to compare carfilzomib  administered once weekly  in 
combination with dexamethasone, based on the CHAMPION 1 results, to twice -weekly 
carfilzomib in combination with dexamethasone in subjects with relapsed and refractory 
multiple myeloma, previously treated with a proteasome inhibitor  and an IMiD.  The 
hypothesis is that this regimen will have superior efficacy with an acceptable safety profile and a more convenient dosing regimen when compared with the US approved 
dose and schedule of carfilzomib administered at 20/27 mg/m
2 twice weekly .

Carfilzomib  Page 28 of 165 
The primary endpoint in this study is PFS.  Response rates, especially high -quality 
responses of substantial duration, are important indicators of benefit in relapsed and 
refractory multiple myeloma (Anderson 2008 ).  A number of studies have shown an 
association between deeper responses and improved survival in patients with multiple myeloma (Lonial 2014).  For these reasons, this study was ori ginally designed with 
ORR as the primary endpoint and PFS as a key secondary endpoint.  Although 
ORR remains a meaningful clinical endpoint, recent advances in antimyeloma 
therapy have altered the landscape such that PFS is now considered to be the more 
relevant regulatory endpoint in this setting .  To support regulatory interactions and 
protect the integrity of the the PFS data, the primary endpoint has been amended to 
PFS, with ORR as a key secondary endpoint.  
2.5 DOSE RATIONALE  
Carfilzomib 20/27 mg/m
2 twice -weekly is an  approved monotherapy dose 
and 20/70 mg/m2 once- weekly is the MTD that was determined in the CHAMPION 1 
study described in Section 2.5.1. 
In the proposed study, dexamethasone will be administered pri or to carfilzomib 
administration at 40  mg weekly on Days  1, 8, and 15 in both arms during all Cycles and 
on Day  22 in both arms during Cycle 1 to 9 only.  This dose and schedule of therapeutic 
dexamethasone was part of the once- weekly treatment regimen in Study CHAMPION 1.  
The equivalent weekly doses of dexamethasone in both treatment arms will enable a clear 
interpretation of the study’s primary comparison between high-dose once- weekly 
carfilzomib and standard- dose twice- weekly carfilzomib.  
Carfilzomib study treatment administration will use a step -up approach in which the first 
dose level for all subjects will be 20  mg/m2 (Cycle  1 Day  1 for the once- weekly regimen 
and Cycle  1 Days  1 and 2 for the twice- weekly regimen) and the dose le vel will then 
increase to 70 mg/m2 or 27 mg/m2 respectively, beginning on Day 8 of Cycle  1.

2.5.1 RATIONALE FOR ONCE -WEEKLY DOSING  
CHAMPION 1, a Phase 1b/2 study in subjects with relapsed multiple myeloma who had 
received 1 to 3 prior therapies  was initiated to investigate higher doses of carfilzomib  
given once- weekly  in combination with  dexamethasone, and preliminary results indicate d 
that these modifications were well tolerated and active.  In the Phase 1b dose- escalation 
portion of the study , all subjects received 20  mg/m2 carfilzomib on Cycle  1 Day  1 and 
then received the cohort- assig ned test dose on Cycle  1 Days 8 and 15.  The initial dose 
level evaluated was 45  mg/m2, with escalation to 56  mg/m2, 70 mg/m2, and 88 mg/m2 in 
Superseding  Amendment  4: 07 March  2017   CONFIDENTIAL

successive cohorts.  Subjects received 40  mg dexamethasone on Days  1, 8, 15, and 22 of 
Cycles  1 through 8 and on Days  1, 8, and 15, from Cycle  9 onward. 
No DLTs were observed during dose escalation at the dose levels of 45  mg/m2, 
56 mg/m2, or 70 mg/m2.  At the carfilzomib dose level of 88 mg/m2, 2 DLTs were 
observed during Cycle  1: 
• Dyspnea (Grade 3, Days 9 to 11)  
• Vomiting (Grade  3, Day  15)  
Per protocol, an expansion cohort of 9 additional subjects  was enrolled at the 70  mg/m2 
dose.  There was 1  DLT in the 70 mg/m2 expansion cohort: Grade 3 dyspnea ( Days  16 to 
18).  The MTD of once-weekly carfilzomib in combination w ith dexamethasone was 
determined to be 70 mg/m2. 
A total of 27 subj ects were enrolled in the Phase 1 portion of the study with a median of 
1 prior therapy.  Fifteen subjects received study treatment at a dose of 70 mg/m2.  
The majority of the 27  subjects ( 85%) received prior bortezomib and 63% of those were 
refractory to bortezomib.  The ORR in the Phase 1 population was 81% with a clinical 
benefit rate (CBR) of 93%.  The once- weekly treatment regimen of 70  mg/m2 showed 
promising activity with an ORR of 93% (95% [confidence interval] CI:  68.1 to  99.8%), 
4 subjects achieved a complete response (CR) and the CBR was 100% (95%  CI:  78.2 
to 100%).  The  median treatment duration was 8.3 months in this cohort ( Berenson  2014).  
All 27 subjects (100%) experienced at least 1 AE.  The most common (≥ 20% of 
subjects) AEs were upper respiratory tract infection, fatigue (each 52%), insomnia (44%), 
diarrhea, nausea, headache (each 41%), anemia, decreased hematocrit (each 37%), 
pyrexia (33%), constipation (30%), back pain, cough, muscle spasms, dyspnea, decreased 
red blood cell count (each 26%), arthralgia, dizziness, and pain in extremity (each 22%).  
Five serious adverse events (SAEs) were reported in the Phase 1 part of this ongoing 
study: 
• One subject at 45  mg/m2 had 2 SAEs; increased blood creatinine (Grade 3) , and 
hyponatremia (Grade 4).   
• One subject at 70  mg/m2 had pneumonia (Grade 3).   
Superseding  Amendment  4: 07 March  2017   CONFIDENTIAL  
Onyx Therapeutics, Inc.  Clinical Study Protocol No . 20140355  
Carfilzomib  Page 31 of 165 
• One subject at 88  mg/m2 had dyspnea (Grade 3).   
• One subject at 70  mg/m2 had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (Grade  3).   
All SAEs were determined to be unrelated to carfilzomib and dexamethasone , except for 
the Grade 3 dyspnea event, a DLT in a subject receiving the 88 mg/m2 dose. 
As of 0 1 May  2015, 104 subjects (Phase 1 n = 15, Phase  2 n = 89) have received at least 
1 dose of carfilzomib at the MTD.  The majority of subjects ( 82%) had received prior 
bortezomib.  A total of 48% of subjects were bortezomib- refractory, 28% were 
lenalidomide -refractory, and 16% were refractory to both.  The ORR to  date was 7 7% 
(95% CI:  6 8% to 8 5%) with a CBR of 8 4% (95% CI:  7 5% to 90%).  Median PFS was 
10.6 months (95% CI:  9.0 to 16.1).  Preliminary median carfilzomib treatment duration 
in the ongoing study is 8.3  months (range:  > 1 to 20) for the Phase 1 portion of the 
study and 7.2 months (range:  0.03 to 22.6) for the Phase 2 portion of the study 
(Berenson 2015).  
All 104 subjects experienced at least 1  AE.  The most common AEs (≥ 15% of subjects) 
were fatigue ( 52%), nausea (3 5%), headache, diarrhea (each  31%),  insomnia, upper 
respiratory tract infection  (each 30%), cough (26%), dyspnea (2 5%), anemia (24%), 
thrombocytopenia, pyrexia (each 22 %), peripheral edema (20%), and back pain  (17%).  
A total of 64 subjects ( 62%) experienced at least 1 Grade 3 or higher AE.  The most 
common (≥ 5% of subjects) Grade 3 or higher AEs were fatigue ( 11%), pneumonia (7%), 
thrombocytopenia, hypertension, acute renal failure (each 6%),  dyspnea , anemia,  back 
pain, asthenia, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (each 5%) (Carfilzomib IB ). 
The preliminary results from CHAMPION  1 demonstrated that once- weekly carfilzomib 
at 70  mg/m2 administered as a 30 -minute infusion in combination with dexamethasone in 
subjects with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma had an acceptable safety and 
tolerability profile and promising efficacy.  Eighty-nine subjects were enrolled into the 
Phase 2 portion of the study.

2.5.2 PHARMACOKINETICS AND PHARMACODYNAMICS DAT A FOR 
ONCE -WEEKLY DOSING  
Pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics ( PDn) results from CHAMPION 1 are 
supportive of the proposal to study the once- weekly 70 mg/m2 regimen as an effective 
alternative regimen for carfilzomib.  
Preliminary PK results from CHAMPION 1 indicated that a once- weekly 30 -minute 
infusion of carfilzomib had a mean terminal half- life similar to the  half-life of ≤ 1 hour 
following the approved twice-weekly dosing regimen (20/27 mg/m2 over 2 to10 minutes ). 
In ad dition, the data showed a dose-proportional increase in the mean C max and area under 
the curve (AUC) from 20 to 88 mg/m2, as indicated by the similar dose normalized values 
for C max and AUC (refer to  Table 1).  The AUC following a 70 mg/m2 dose was  
1045 ng⋅h/mL, which is higher than the total weekly AUC following the twice- weekly of 
27 mg/m2 dose (758 ng ⋅h/mL, refer to Table 2).  The mean C max following the 70 mg/m2 
dose administered as a 30 -minute infusion is 2640 ng/mL, which is lower than the mean 
Cmax of 4232 ng/mL in Study PX -171-003 – Part  2 (A1), following the IV infusion of 
27 mg/m2 over 2 to 10 minutes  (Carfilzomib IB ).

a AUC following a single 20 and 27 mg/m2 dose (2– 10 minutes infusion) is 283 and 379 ng⋅ hr/mL, 
respectively.  Total AUC per week is calculated by multiplying the single dose AUC by 2 
(e.g., 379 × 2 = 758 ng⋅h/mL).   
b Represents total AUC per week starting on Day 8 . 
An exploratory exposure response analysis indicates a statistically significant relationship  
between the 
carfilzomib average AUC during Cycle  1 and response rates (ORR and 
CBR) with higher AUC exposures associated with improved responses in subjects with 
multiple myeloma (TR-1092-171) .  No statistically significant relationships between C max 
and efficacy or safety endpoints were found.   
Prelimina ry PDn data from CHAMPION 1  revealed  that in blood and peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells (PBMCs) the 70 mg/m2 dose level resulted in a greater depth of 
proteasome inhibition, at 1-hour post dose, compared to 1 hour after the Cycle  2 Day  1 
dose i n a twice-weekly schedule of 27 mg/m2 and 56 mg/m2 (as observed in the 
Phase 1b/2 PX-171-007 study).  Chymotrypsin -like subunits (Beta 5 and latent membrane 
protein 7 [ LMP7 ]) were inhibited most strongly, followed by trypsin- like (Beta 2 and 
multicatalytic endopeptidase complex -like 1  [MECL -1]), and caspase- like (Beta 1 and 
latent  membrane protein 2 [LMP2]) subunits, respectively (refer to Figure  1). 
Together, PK and PDn results from CHAMPION 1 support the investigation of 
once- weekly 70  mg/m2 regimen as a potentially  effective alternative regimen for

withdrawal of consent, or death (whichever occurs first).   No crossover between the 
2 treatment groups before progre ssion will be allowed.  
Disease assessments will be conducted at Screening (within 21  days before 
randomization) and then every 28  days ±  4 days  after Cycle 1 Day 1 , End of Treatment 
(EOT ), and during LTFU every 28  days  ± 4 days , until PD and/or administration of 
subsequent antimyeloma therapy.  Response will be evaluated using the International 
Myeloma Working Group- Uniform  Response Criteria (IMWG -URC).  
Following termination of study treatment, all subjects will be followed for disease status  
(if PD has not been reached) , subsequent antimyeloma treatment, and survival. 
All subjects will be  followed for AEs  for at least 30 additional days after the last study  
treatment  administration .  All treatment-related AEs and SAEs will be followed until 
resolution or st abilization.    
4.2 NUMBER OF CENTERS  
Approximately 150 sites worldwide will participate.  
4.3 NUMBER OF SUBJECTS  
Approximately 460 subjects (230 subjects  per treatment group) will take part in this 
study. 
4.4 ESTIMATED STUDY DURATION AND CLOSURE  
The total study accrual period is expected to be approximately 15  months.  The interim 
analysis of PFS will occur when approximately 263 PFS events are observed.  If the 
interim analysis crosses the boundary, the trial may stop early for efficacy; 
otherwise s ubjects will be followed for disease and survival status until approximately 
350 PFS events are observed  or by end of year 2018, whichever is earlier.

the primary endpoint(s), for the purposes of conducting the primary analysis, 
whether the study concluded as planned in the protocol or was terminated early .   
The p rimary completion is anticipated  to occur when approximately 350 PFS events 
occur or end of year 2018, whichever is earlier.  The primary completion date is the 
date when data for the pr imary endpoint are last collected for the purposes  of 
conducting the primary analysis  or the end of year 2018, whichever is earlier.   
If the study concludes prior to the primary completion date originally planned in the protocol (i .e., early termination of the study), then the primary completion will 
be the date when the last subject is assessed or receives an intervention for evaluation in the study (i .e., last subject last visit).  
End of Study:  The end of study date is defined as the date when the last subject 
across all sites is assessed or receives an intervention for evaluation in the study (i.e., 
last subject last visit), following any additional parts in the study (e .g., long- term 
follow -up), as applicable.

All subjects who provide consent will be assigned a unique study number.  This number 
will be used to identify the subject throughout the clinical stu dy and must be used on all 
study documentation related to that subject. 
The Screening period commences when  the subject or a legally -authorized representative 
signs the ICF. Screening must be completed within the 21 days prior to randomization. 
7 SUBJECT RANDOMIZATION  
The primary investigator will determine the subject’s eligibility, ensuring that the results 
of the required screening procedures are consistent with all of the eligibilit y criteria 
presented in Section 5.  No eligibility waivers will be permitted.   Randomization will be 
carried out centrally through an interactive voice and web response ( IVR/ IWR) system .  
Please refer to the separate study reference manual.   
Eligible subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either:  
• Arm A:  Once -weekly carfilzomib with dexamethasone regimen  
• Arm B:  Twice -weekly carfilzomib with dexamethasone regimen  
The randomization will be stratified by the following factors:  
• International Staging System (ISS) at study entry (Stage  1 versus Stage 2 or 3) 
(Appendix H ) 
• Refractory to bortezomib treatment (Yes versus No)  
• Age (< 65 versus ≥ 65 years)  
Within each stratum defined by the stratification factors, subjects will be randomized according to a randomly permuted blocked randomization scheme. 
Study treatment will ideally commence on the day of randomization , but at l east within 
5 calen dar days  of randomization.  Initiation of study treatment (Cycle  1 
Day 1) > 5 calendar days after randomization must be approved by the study medical 
monitor.

9 DOSAGE AND TREATMENT  ADMINISTRATION 
9.1 TREATMENT REGIMEN  
Carfilzomib and dexamethasone will be administered in 28- day cycles.  All cycles will 
start 28  days (±  2 days ) afte r the start of the prior  cycle.  
In the once -weekly carfilzomib arm, intra -cycle doses of carfilzomib and dexamethasone 
may be administered within ±  2 days of the scheduled dose. However, carfilzomib must 
not be administered within the 5  days following a previous carfilzomib infusion.  Dose 
delays >  2 days are only permitted during the start of a new cycle.  
In the twice-weekly carfilzomib arm, every effort should be made to maintain the Days 1, 
2, 8, 9, 15, and 16, every 28-day schedule.  If this is not possible, then priority should be 
to maintain consecutive dosing days.  For example, if  Day  1 of a new cycle is started 
2 days later than originally scheduled, the entire cycle should shift by 2 days, such that the new Days  1, 2, 8, 9, 15, and 16 of the next cycle are maintained.   Dosing on 
nonconsecutive days should only occur under exceptional circumstances, such as interruptions due to national holidays.  There must always be at least 5 day s between the 
second dose of 1 week and the first dose of the following week ( ie, between Days 2 and 
8, and  Days 9 and 15).  Mid-cycle doses that are missed should not be made up, unless 
these parameters are maintained.  
The reason s for all cycle delays , schedule changes,  missed doses, and dose interruptions 
will b e reported.

9.2.1.1 Carfilzomib  
Carfilzomib will be administered as an IV infusion over approximately 30 minutes  in the 
once- weekly arm and over approximately  10 minutes in the twice -weekly arm . 
Carfilzomib for Injection is supplied as a lyophilized parenteral product in single- use 
vials.  The lyophilized product is reconstituted with Sterile Water for Injection (SWI), 
United States Pharmacopeia (USP), to a fin al carfilzomib concentration of 2 mg /mL.  
Mechanical infusion pumps are recommended, but gravity-dependent infusions are permitted , if the infusion duration can be reliably maintained.  Carfilzomib infusion must 
occur at a facility capable of managing hyper sensitivity reactions .  Subjects will remain at 
the investigational site  under observation for at least 1 hour following each infusion of 
carfilzomib in Cycle  1.  Carfilzomib should be administered via a dedicated IV line , 
whenever possible.  Refer to the IPIM for detailed information regarding equipment and 
flush requirements. 
9.2.1.2 Dexamethasone 
Dexamethasone will be taken PO or administered by IV infusion.  Dexamethasone will be administered at least 30  minutes (but no more than 4 hours) prior to carfilzomib 
infusion on Days 1, 8, and 15 in both treatment arms.  Dexamethasone on Day  22 should 
be taken PO , whenever possible.  Note: Dexamethasone on Day  22 in both treatment 
arms will only be administered during Cycles  1 to 9. 
9.3 DOSE MODIFICATION RULES   
In the event of a possible study treatment-related AE, the clinical investigator should assess, to the best of his/her ability , its relationship to carfilzomib and/or dexamethasone.  
Dose  reduction rules for carfilzomib  are presented in  Table 4 and  Table 5 and are often 
event -specific .   
• If a subject requires interruption of carfilzomib for more than 28 days, the subject 
should be removed from study treatment.  Exceptions must first be approved by 
the study medical monitor.   
• If a subject requires carfilzomib dose reduction, the reduced dose level will be 
continued for at least 1 complete cycle.  After that, if the reduced dose level ha s

been well tolerated, the previous dose level may b e resumed at the investigator’s 
discretion . 
• If carfilzomib is temporarily held due to an AE , dexamethasone should be 
continued, unless the investigator determines that criteria for interrupting  
dexamethasone have also been  met.  
• If carfilzomib is permanentl y discontinued due to toxicity, dexamethasone must 
also be discontinued and the subject will be followed for disease progression per 
the guidelines in Section 10.10.1. 
• If dexamethasone is permanently discontinued due to toxicity, the subject may 
continue to receive study treatment with carfilzomib at the investigator’s 
discretion.

A concomitant medication is defined as any prescription or over-the-counter preparation, 
including vitamins and supplements.  For all randomized subjects, all admini stered 
concomitant medications and therapies, from signing of the informed consent until 30 days after the last dose of study treatment, must be recorded in the designated 
electronic case report f orm (eCRF) . 
Concomitant medications required for the study or used prophylactically should be described as such in the designated eCRF.  Concomitant medications prescribed for “prn” 
or “as needed” use should not be reported, unless actually administered.  
Blood and  blood products are not considered concomitant medications and must be 
recorded on the appropriate eCRF.

until 30 days (females) or 90 days (males) after the last study drug administration.  If 
applicable, refer to the Country Specific Pregnancy and Contraceptive Supplement 
(refer  to Appendix K ). 
If a subject thinks she may be pregnant (e.g., if a menstrual period in an FCBP does not 
occur at the anticipated time), study drug treatment must be interrupted, and a urine or 
serum pregnancy test must be performed locally.  Study drug administ ration may resume 
after documen tation of a nonpregnant state. 
9.4.2 RECOMMENDED CONCOMITANT MEDICATIONS  
9.4.2.1 Antiviral Prophylaxis 
Valacyclovir  (or an equivalent antiviral agent ) is recommended for prophylaxis against

9.4.3 EXCLUDED CONCOMITANT  MEDICATIONS  AND T HERAPIES  
If an investigator deems that use of an excluded concomitant medication or therapy is 
required but does not believe that withdrawal from study treatment is indicated, he/she 
must contact the study medical monitor to determine if continued study treatment is 
acceptable.  
9.4.3.1 Anticancer Agents  
Therapy with a marketed or investigational anticancer agent that is not required per this 
protocol is prohibited, while subjects remain on study treat ment , and should be avoided 
prior to documentation of disease progression.   
9.4.3.2 Radiation Therapy 
Radiation to large marrow reserves is prohibited;  however, focal palliative radiation is 
allowed with permission from the study medical monitor.  
9.4.3.3 Myeloid Growth  Factors  
Prophylactic use of myeloid growth factors is prohibited, but they may be used for management of neutropenia, in accordance with American Society of Clinical Oncology 
(ASCO) Guidelines (Smith  2006).  
9.4.3.4 Corticosteroids   
Corticosteroids should not be used to treat concurrent medical conditions, unless the dose 
remains less than the equivalent of 4 mg/day of dexamethasone.  Short term use of higher 
doses may be permitted to treat acute exacerbations of concurrent medical conditions, but 
this must be discussed with the study medical monitor as soon as is possible. 
9.4.3.5 Plasmapheresis  
Plasmapheresis is not permitted at any time during the Screening period or while the 
subject is receiving study treatment.  If a subject  who has started s creening procedures 
requires plasmapheresis or is anticipated to require plasmapheresis during or after the Screening period, this subject will be considered ineligible.

For s ubjects requiring plasmapheresis while on study treatment, ever y attempt should be 
made to document disease status by IMWG criteria first .  Study treatment must be 
discontinued and the subject will enter LTFU. 
9.4.3.6 Novel Agents  for Non -neoplastic Conditions  
The use of novel agents for non-neoplastic conditions is prohibited throughout the 
duration of treatment and for 30 days following the last dose of study treatment. 
10 STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES  
All protocol-required tests and observations, along with their chronology, are outlined in the Schedule of Assessments (refer to  Appendix A ).  Protocol- specified  assessments  and 
procedures are summarized below.  
10.1 STUDY SPECIFIC PROCEDURES  
10.1.1 
MULTIPLE MYELOMA HIS TORY AND PRIOR LINES  OF 
THERAPY ASSESSMENT  
When documenting prior therapies for m ultiple myeloma, the following guidelines should 
be used: 
• A new line of therapy is considered to start when a planned course of therapy is 
modified to include other treatment agents (alone or in combination) as a result 
of lack of adequate response, PD (ev en if the level of progression has not yet 
met IMWG criteria for PD), relapse, or toxicity.   A new therapy is also 
considered to start when a planned period of observation off- therapy is 
interrupted by a need for additional lines of therapy.  
• An increase i n treatment administration, with the intention of recapturing 
response in a patient with evidence of disease progression on that line of therapy , is considered  to be  a new line of therapy .   
Examples of a line of therapy include:  
• Induction therapy and ste m cell transplant followed by planned maintenance 
therapy (provided there is no intervening PD) 
• Induction therapy followed by maintenance therapy (provided there is no 
intervening PD)

10.1.2 VITAL SIGNS  
Vital signs will include heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and temperature and 
will be assessed at Screenin g, prior to each administration of carfilzomib , EOT, and as 
needed to assess potential AEs.  Clinically significant abnormal vital signs will be 
reported as AEs.  
10.1.3 COMPLETE PHYSICAL EXAMINATION 
A physical examination will be performed during Screening, prior to dosing on Day 1 of 
each cycle, and at the EOT.  For Cycle  1 Day  1, the screening physical examination may 
be used if performed within 7  days prior to Cycle 1 Day  1.  Physical exam may be 
completed up to 3 days prior to Day 1 of each cycle.   At a minimu m, the physical exam 
should include constitutional, abdominal, cardiovascular, and respiratory assessments.  
Clinically significant abnormal findings identified after the signing of informed consent 
must be reported as AEs and examined more frequently, as c linically indicated.   Note: 
Clinically  significant a bnormal physical examination findings identified prior to the 
signing of informed consent should be reported as part of Medical History, not as AEs. 
BSA  is to be determined by a standard formula, such as the Mosteller Formula 
(Mosteller  1987): body surface area ( BSA ) (m²) = ([Height (cm) × Weight (kg)]/ 
3600 )½.  B ody surface area must be recalculated and used for subsequent dose 
determinations , if the  subject experiences a weight change of ≥ 20%.   Recalculations of 
BSA must be made using the same technique as used at baseline.

must be available, prior to random ization.  
10.2 MULTIPLE MYELOMA DISEASE ASSESSMENTS  
Disease response and progression assessments include (but are not limited to): SPEP,  
urine protein electrophoresis  (UPEP ), immunofixation, SFLC, bone marrow sample 
evaluation, serum calcium, plasmacytoma evalua tion, and skeletal survey.  Multiple 
myeloma assessment should be based on calendar day, regardless of cycle delay.  SPEP, 
UPEP, immunofixation, SFLC, bone  marrow evaluation, and serum calcium will all be 
conducted at the central laboratory.  
The following disease assessments must be performed at Screening:  
• SPEP, UPEP (24 -hour assessment, no substitute method is acceptable), 
and immunofixation  
• SFLC  
• Quantitative immunoglobulins  
• Beta-2 microglobulin  
Cycle  1 Day  1 before treatment begins (Screening values may be used if obtained within 
7 days prior to Cycle 1 Day 1), and every 28  days (± 4  days) thereafter, at EOT , and 
during LTFU if disease progression has not already been documented (every 28 days ± 4 
days, until PD and/or started a subsequent antimyeloma ther apy):  
•  SPEP, immunofixation 
• UPEP (24 -hour assessment, no substi tute method is acceptable), 
and immunofixation : post- Cycle  1 Day  1 measurements required only if Cycle 1

Carfilzomib  Page 60 of 165 
Day 1 UPEP ≥ 200 mg/24  hours or to confirm a disease response (for very good 
partial res ponse [VGPR] or better) or progression (if applicable) 
• SFLC : post- Cycle  1 Day 1 measurements required only for SFLC measurable 
disease or to confirm stringent complete response ( sCR) 
• Quantitative immunoglobulins  
Subjects will be instructed to collect 24 -hour urine samples for assessment of UPEP at 
Screening and as required during the study.  This collection will occur over 2 days and 
will be assessed at the central laboratory.  For further instructions , refer to the Central 
Laboratory Services Manual.   
Radiological disease assessments at baseline are collected after subject eligibility is 
confirmed and may be done after randomization (as long as they are  done before the start 
of treatment ).  Radiological disease assessments that were done per standard of ca re 
within  30 days before Cycle 1 Day  1 can be used as study baseline disease assessments.  
They  include:  
Extramedullary Plasmacytoma Assessment  
• A plasmacytoma e valuation will be conducted at b aseline, only if a lesion is 
suspected clinically . 
• If an extramedullary plasmacytoma is detected, evaluation will be repeated during 
treatment to confirm a response of PR or better or to assess for PD based on 
plasmacytoma . 
• Plasmacytomas are considered measurable if  they have a longest diameter of at 
least 1 cm and the product of cross diameter measurements is at least 1 cm2.  
Plasmacytomas of lesser size are considered unmeasurable.  Bidi mensional 
measurements must be recorded in the designated eCRF.  The same technique 
must be used to evaluate plasmacytomas throughout the duration of study 
participation and may include: palpation, ultrasound, x-ray, computed tomography (CT) scan, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), or any other technique that is considered to be standard of 
care.  
Skeletal Survey 
• Skeletal survey  will include lateral radiograph of the skull, anteroposterior and 
lateral views of the spine, and anteroposterior views of the pelvis, ribs, femora, 
and humeri.  The skeletal survey will be conducted at baseline and will be repeated if worsening clinical symptoms suggest PD, or as clinically indicated.  
• Other radiologic modalities for performing skeletal assessment (eg , low-dose CT 
scan) are acceptable, in accordance with regional standards.

10.3 MULTIPLE MYELOMA RESPONSE ASS ESSMENTS  
10.3.1 DISEASE RESPONSE AND P ROGRESSION ASSESSMEN TS 
Determination of disease response must be based on the reported val ues from the central 
laboratory .  Local laboratory results may be used for hypercalcemia (corrected calcium 
based on albumin), but a confirmatory sample should be collected and sent to the central 
laboratory for documentation. 
Investigator-determined responses must be based on results from the central laboratory  
and must be consistent with the IMWG -URC (see definitions in  Appendix G ).  
10.3.2 TUMOR RESPONSE ASSES SMENT  
The following confirmatory assessments are required for all response categories (sCR, 
CR, VGPR, PR, minimal response [MR] and PD; refer to definitions in Appendix  G: 
• All laboratory -based PD (except bone marrow sample) and all response categories 
require 2 consecutive assessments made at any time before initiation of new 
therapy.  
• All response categories require that there be no evidence of disease progression, 
including confirmation of no new bone lesions, if radiographic studies were 
performed.  
• The preferred method of confirming  CR or sCR is a bone marrow biopsy; 
however, a bone marrow aspirate is also acceptable for confirmation of CR. 
• Extramedullary plasmacytoma evaluation (if present at Screening).  Two 
consecutive radiographic tests are not required to confirm response or 
progression of extramedullary plasmacytoma. 
• In the case where a patient does not have measurable M -protein by UPEP at 
baseline (i.e., baseli ne UPEP <  200 mg/24  hours), when SPEP is consistent with 
response (i.e., ≥ PR), 2 consecutive UPEP measurements must be performed to 
confirm response. 
10.3.3 DISEASE PROGRESSION 
Disease progression will be documented in an eCRF intended to capture PD information 
and will be analyzed as a study endpoint.  Signs  and symptoms related to  disease 
progression (e.g., pathologic fracture in a subject with progressive multiple myeloma) should be reported in the appropriate e CRF as an  AE or as an SAE (if the event in 
question meets the criteria for seriousness).  Verbatim terms such as “disease progression,” “progressive disease,” etc. should not be reported as AEs or SAEs unless 
Superseding Amendment  4: 07 March  2017   CONFIDENTIAL  
Onyx Therapeutics, Inc.  Clinical Study Protocol No . 20140355  
Carfilzomib  Page 62 of 165 
the investigator considers the progression to be atypical, accelerated, or caused by the 
study drug.  Similarly deaths occurring as a result of disease progression should be 
reported on the eCRF intended to capture death information and should not be reported as 
SAEs.  
Study treatment should not be discontinued on the basis of disease progression, until PD 
has been appropriately confirmed per IMWG -URC .  Disease progression during LTFU 
must also be confirmed by these same criteria.  Co nfirmation of PD will require 
2 consecutive central laboratory evaluations that indicate PD, except in cases where PD is 
based on extramedullary lesions or hypercalcemia that is attributed solely to PD .  These 
assessments should be separated in time by at least 1 calendar day , but no more than 
28 ± 4 calendar days.  Local laboratory  results may not be used to determine or conf irm 
disease progression, except when PD is based on hypercalcemia.   The assessments 
outlined in Appendix B  are required for PD  determination . 
10.4 LABORATORY TESTS  
Laboratory tests for efficacy and safety during schedu led and unscheduled study visits, 
including screening will be performed at a central laboratory.   Additional safety 
laboratory samples must also be collected and analyzed by local laboratories if  the results 
are necessary to determine the appropriateness o f dose administration.  In rare 
circumstances, when the central laboratory is unable to provide results for tests that are needed to determine eligibility, the study medical monitor may grant permission for local 
laboratory results to be applied to the s creening requirements.  Local labs may also be 
required for management of treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs) .  Laboratory 
tests for disease assessment are described in  Section 10.2. 
Safety samples must be obtained within the 1 day prior to carfilzomib administration  and 
the results must be reviewed prior to the start of the carfilzomib infusion s on Days 1, 8, 
and 15 of Cycles 1 to 4.  Beyond Cycle 4, these labs are only required on Days  1 and 15 
of each cycle.

10.4.1 HEMATOLOGY  
Hematology assessments  (Table 8) will be performed during Screening, on Days 1, 8, and 
15 for Cycles 1 to 4 and EOT.  Beyond Cycle 4 labs will be performed on Days 1 and 15 
of each cycle.  For Cycle  1 Day  1, hematology assessments from Screening can be used, 
if they were obtained within 3 days  prior to carfilzomib administration .  For subsequent 
visits, hematology assessments may be completed up to 1 day prior to the scheduled dose.

A serum chemistry panel (Table 9) will be performed during Screening, on Days 1, 8, and 
15 for Cycles 1 to 4 and EOT.  Beyond Cycle 4, labs will be performed on Days 1 and 15 of each cycle.  For Cycle  1 Day  1, serum  chemistry assessments from Screening can be 
used, if performed within 3  days  prior to  carfilzomib administration .  For subsequent 
visits, serum chemistries may be completed up  to 1 day prior to the scheduled carfilzomib 
dose.

Coagulation tests  will be performed at a central laboratory at Screening and at EOT :  
• Prothrombin time (PT)  
• Activated partial thromboplastin time (PTT)  
• International normalized ratio (INR)  
10.4.4 PREGNANCY TESTING  
For FCBP, a serum pregnancy test that is confir med negative is required for eligibility 
determination and is to be performed at the central laboratory; FCBP is defined in 
Appendix K .  In addition to the pregnancy tests conducted for eligibility, a serum or urine 
pregnancy test must be confirmed negative locally on Day 1 of each cycle and at  EOT .  
A negative pregnancy test result must be available prior to the first dose of study 
treatment.   More frequent pregnancy tests may be conducted if required per local 
regulations or investigational sites . 
10.5 ELECTROCARDIOGRAM  
Twelve- lead electrocardiogram s (ECGs) including corrected QT -interval (QTc; 
representing the corrected duration of ventricular electrical activity) will be performed 
locally .  Electrocardiogram s will be required from  all subjects at  Screening and EOT.  
Additional ECG assessment is only required if c linically indicated.  
Superseding Amendment  4: 07 March  2017   CONFIDENTIAL  
Onyx Therapeutics, Inc.  Clinical Study Protocol No . 20140355  
Carfilzomib  Page 65 of 165 
10.6 ECHOCARDIOGRAM  
A 2-D transthoracic echocardiogram ( ECHO) is required to assess LVEF  during 
Screening and will also serve as the baseline E CHO .  If transthoracic ECHO is not 
available, multigated acquisition ( MUGA) will be acceptable for  LVEF evaluation. 
Any subject with a clinically significant cardiac AE should be evaluated by a cardiologist 
and must have a follow- up ECHO, if medically indicated.   
10.7 PATIENT REPORTED OUTCOMES 
Patient reported outcomes (PRO) are based on the following questionnaires 
(refer to Appendix J). 
All questionnaires should be
 collected on Day 1 of Cycle 1, then every second cycle 
(Cycle  1, 3, 5, etc) during treatment.  The q uestionnaires listed below should be 
completed by the subject prior to drug administration during treatment cycles:  
•EORTC QLQ -C30
•EORTC QLQ -MY20
•EQ-5D- 5L
•Patient reported convenience and satisfaction (collected Day  1 Cycle  2 and EOT
only) 
Health -related Q uality of Life (HRQL ) will be assessed by the EORTC 30 -item 
QLQ -C30 questionnaire and by the 20- item QLQ -MY20 module specifically designed to 
address the quality of life for those with multiple myeloma  (Aaronson 1993; Fayers  2001; 
Cocks 2007) .  The primary constructed scales f rom the QLC -C30 are:  
•Global H ealth Status/Quality of Life
•Physical  functioning
•Role f unctioning
•Emotional functioning
•Cognitive functioning
•Social f unctioning
•Nine additional scales can be derived:
•Fatigue
Superseding Amendment  4: 07 March  2017  CONFIDENTIAL  
Onyx Therapeutics, Inc.  Clinical Study Protocol No . 20140355  
Carfilzomib  Page 66 of 165 
• Nausea and v omiting  
• Pain  
• Dyspn ea 
• Insomnia  
• Appetite loss  
• Constipation  
• Diarrhea  
• Financial d ifficulties  
The prim ary scales from the QLQ -MY20 include disease symptoms, side effects of 
treatment, body image and future perspectives.  
The EQ-5D- 5L is a standardized measure of health status developed by the EuroQol 
Group in order to provide a simple, generic measure of he alth for clinical and economic 
appraisal (EuroQol Group  1990) .  The EQ -5D-5L version will be used in this study.  The 
EQ-5D-5L consists of a 1- page descriptive system  and a 1 -page EQ Visual Analogue 
scale (EQ V AS).  The descriptive system comprises 5 dimensions (mobility, self -care, 
usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression).  Each dimension is then scored 
on 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, and 
extreme problems.  The respondent is asked to indicate his/her health state by ticking (or 
placing a cross) in the box against the most appropriate statement in each of the 5 dimensions.  The EQ VAS records the respondent’s self-rated health on a 20 cm 
vertical, visual analogue scale with  endpoints labelled ‘the best health you can imagine’ 
and ‘the worst health you can imagine’.  This information  can be used as a quantitative 
measure of health as judged by the individual respondents. 
Patient reported convenience a nd satisfaction with the carfilzomib dosing schedule will 
be provided as a 1- page questionnaire on the tablet.  Subjects will be instructed to fill out 
the questionnaires to the best of his/her abilities .  The study coordinator will be 
responsible for signing off that the subject has completed the questionnaires.

10.8 HEALTHCARE RESOURCE UTILIZATION   
Healthcare resource utilization data related to AEs will be collected for each subject .  
These data may include inpatient care, outpatient care, surgery, and use of  other 
medications and therapeutic procedures related to AEs.  Details on hospitalizations (not 
related to AEs) will also be collected.  
10.9 CORRELATIVE STUDIES  
Samples for correlative studies will be collected only after confirmation of  study 
eligibility .  Intensive PK and PDn will be conducted as a substudy at selected sites.  
Sparse PK samples will be collected at all other sites from subjects who consent to the 
additional testing.   
10.9.1 INTENSIVE PHARMACOKINETICS/ PHARMACODYNAMICS  
SUBSTUDY  
Approximately 15 evaluable subjects in each arm will participate in the intensive PK/PDn 
substudy at select sites.  On both arms, whole blood and PBMCs will be collected from all subjects on Days 1, 15, 16, 17, and 22 of Cycle 1 at the timepoints (summarized in 
Table 10).  Directions for collection, processing, and shipping of PDn blood samples are provided in the Central L aboratory Services  Manual.  The actual time of when the PDn 
sample was collected will be recorded.

For both treatment arms, PK samples will be collected from all subjects for determination 
of plasma concentrations of carfi lzomib on treatment Day  15 of Cycle 1 at the following 
time points: 
• Predose (within 5 minutes  before the start of infusion) 
• 15 minutes  (± 5  minutes ) after the start of infusion for Arm A only  (once- weekly 
carfilzomib)  
• Immediately prior to (within 2  minutes  before) the end of infusion 
• 15 minutes  (± 5  minutes ) after the end of infusion 
• 60 minutes  (± 5  minutes ) after the end of infusion 
• 2 hours (± 5  minutes ) after the end of infusion  
The actual time of PK sample collection will be recorded.  Samples will be c ollected 
within ±  5 minute time window s around the nominal time points (except for the time 
point immediately prior to the end of infusion, for which the PK collection needs to occur 
prior to the end of infusion).  Directions for collection, processing, and shipping of PK 
samples are provided in the Central Laboratory Services Manual.  
10.9.2 SPARSE PHARMACOKINET IC SAMPLING  
Sparse PK samples will be collected from subjects who do not participate in the intensive 
PK/PDn substudy and who consent to the additional te sting.  The actual time of the PK 
sample collection will be recorded.  These samples will be assessed at a central 
laboratory.  Directions for collection, processing, and shipping of PK samples are 
provided in the Central Laboratory Services Manual .   
The sparse PK samples will be collected on Cycle 2 Day  1 at the following time points: 
• Predose (within 5 minutes  before the start of infusion) 
• 15 minutes  (± 5  minutes ) after the start of infusion  for Arm A only  (once- weekly 
carfilzomib)  
• Immediately prior to (w ithin 2 minutes  before) the end of infusion 
• 30 minutes  (± 5  minutes ) after the end of infusion 
10.10 LONG -TERM FOLLOW -UP 
There are 2 criteria which mark when subjects may enter LTFU.  Subjects may enter into LTFU when discontinuing treatment before disease progression occurs (refer to 
Superseding Amendment  4: 07 March  2017   CONFIDENTIAL  
Onyx Therapeutics, Inc.  Clinical Study Protocol No . 20140355  
Carfilzomib  Page 69 of 165 
Section  10.10.1, below), or, subjects may enter into LTFU when discontinuing due to 
disease progression (outlined in Section 10.10.2).   
10.10.1 LONG -TERM FOLLOW -UP BEFORE DISEASE PR OGRESSION  
For subjects who discontinue treatment before disease progression occurs , disease 
assessment s will be performed (using the central laboratory results) every 
28 days  ± 4 days until the subject has PD or until withdr awal of consent  (Appendix B ).  
Confirmatory PD results (refer to  Appendix G ) must be obtained prior to the initiation of 
new antimyeloma therapy.  Subject reported outcomes (PROs) including the EORTC 
QLQ -C30 and QLQ-MY20, EQ -5D- 5L and Healthcare Resource Utilization will be 
collected for these subjects who discontinue therapy prior to progression; assessments will be conducted every 12 weeks (every 84  days  ± 4 days) until progression, or 
withdrawal of consent during LTFU ( Appendix A ).  Long- term follow -up will continue 
until the subject has withdrawn consent for further participation, is lost to follow-up, has 
died, or the sponsor makes a decision to close the study.  For any subject who is lost to 
follow- up, the study site will attempt to ascertain survival information via public database 
search.  
10.10.2 
LONG -TERM FOLLOW -UP AFTER DISEASE PROGRE SSION 
(FOR  SURVIVAL)  
After completion of the EOT visit, subjects  who have discontinued due to disease 
progression will be followed for survival status, queried by telephone contact or other 
method, approximately every 12 weeks ± 28 days , or as needed until study closure. 
11 STUDY DISCONTINUATIO N 
11.1 WITHDRAWAL OF SUBJECTS FROM STU DY TREATMENT  
Subjects may withdraw from study treatment at any time.  Reasons for discontinuation include , but are not limited to: 
• Adverse event  
• Pregnancy  
• Death  
• Lost to follow-up 
Superseding Amendment  4: 07 March  2017   CONFIDENTIAL  
Onyx Therapeutics, Inc.  Clinical Study Protocol No . 20140355  
Carfilzomib  Page 70 of 165 
• Non-compliance with study requirements  
• Withdrawal of cons ent by subject  
• Study termination by Sponsor 
• Investigator decision  
• Progression of disease 
The primary reason for study treatment discontinuation will be documented in the eCRF .  
Investigators will be instructed to interview subjects to obtain the most accur ate reason 
for study treatment discontinuation , while respecti ng the privacy of the subject. 
If the reason for study treatment discontinuation is the occurrence of an AE, the subject 
will be followed by the investigator until such event(s) resolve s, stabil izes, or, according 
to the investigator’s judgment, no longer requires  follow-up.   
Study treatment discontinuation due to PD  should be recorded as “disease progression.”  
All subjects who are withdrawn from study treatment will be encouraged to complete all relevant safety assessments and continue in the LTFU period.  Subjects who discontinue 
study treatment will be followed for survival and disease status (if discontinuation is prior 
to progression) until study closure (refer to Appendix B , footnote d). 
11.2 WITHDRAWAL OF SUBJECTS FROM STUDY 
Reasons for complete withdrawal from study (treatment and all follow -up) before 
documentation of subject death include: 
• Withdrawal of consent by subject for all study procedures and study participation  
• Lost to follow-up 
• Sponsor decision  
The reason for complete withdrawal from the study will be documented in the eCRF.

11.3 STUDY TERMINATION 
Sponsor has the right to terminate this study or to terminate a study site from 
participating in the  study at any time.  Reasons for study or site termination may include , 
but are not limited to : 
• The incidence or severity of AEs in this or other carfilzomib studies indicates a 
potential health hazard to subjects 
• Subject enrollment is unsatisfactory  
• Data recording is inaccurate or incomplete 
• Investigator does not adhere to the protocol or applicable regulatory requirements 
in conducting the study 
• Investigational site non -compliance with International Conference on 
Harmonisation/G ood C linical Practice (ICH/ GCP)  
12 ADVERSE EVENTS AND SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT S  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject  administered a  study drug  and 
which is not necessarily caused by the study drug .  An AE can therefore be any 
unfavorable and unintended sign (e.g. an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally  associated with the use of a medicinal product, combination product, 
or medical device, whether or not considered related to the product.  In addition to new events, any worsening of a pre- existing c ondition that occurs after the subject signs the 
ICF for participation is considered an AE.  Worsening indicates that the pre- existing 
medical condition or underlying disease has increased in severity, frequency, and/or duration more than would be expected, and/or has an association with a significantly 
worse outcome than expected.  This includes any side effect, injury, toxicity, or 
sensitivity reaction.  All reported AEs will be coded using the current version of Medical 
Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA).  
12.1 ADVERSE EVENT REPORT ING  
12.1.1 
ADVERSE EVENT TERMINOLOGY  
When reporting an AE, accurate and standard medical terminology should be used that clearly identifies the event and the affected body system.  Use of non -standard 
terminology and/or abbreviations should be avoided to ensure accurate and complete 
Superseding Amendment  4: 07 March  2017   CONFIDENTIAL  
Onyx Therapeutics, Inc.  Clinical Study Protocol No . 20140355  
Carfilzomib  Page 72 of 165 
reporting of AEs.  Individual signs and symptoms should be reported unless they result in 
a definitive diagnosis of an event or represent a well-recognized syndrome.   
12.1.2 SEVERITY  
Whenever possible, the National Cancer Institute -Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events ( NCI-CTCAE)  Version  4.03 should be used to describe the event and to  
assess the severity of AEs (NCI 2010 ).  For AEs not adequately addressed in the 
NCI-CTCAE  Version  4.03, the following criteria should be used (see Table 11). 
Table 11 Grading for Adverse Events not Covered in the NCI -CTCAE  
Severity  Description  
GRADE 1 – Mild Asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations 
only; intervention not indicated  
GRADE 2 – Moderate  Minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age-appropriate instrumental activities of daily living (ADL)  
GRADE 3  – Severe  Medically significant but not immediately life threatening; 
hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; 
limiting self -care ADL  
GRADE 4 – Life-threatening  Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated  
GRADE 5 – Fatal  Death  
NCI-CTCAE = National Cancer Institute -Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events . 
An AE or suspected adverse reaction (ADR)  is considered “unexpected” if it is not listed 
in the current  Carfilzomib IB  or is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been 
observed.  Adverse events or suspected ADRs  that are mentioned in the IB as occurring 
with a class of drugs or as anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the drug, 
but are not specifically mentioned as occurring with particular study drug are considered 
“unexpected.”  For example, an event more specific or more severe than described in the 
IB would be considered “unexpected.”  Any condition, laboratory abnormality, or physical finding with an onset date prior to the subject signing the ICF is considered to be 
pre-existing in nature and part of the subject’s medical history and should not be 
considered an AE. 
Abnormal laboratory findings should be reported a s AEs if medical intervention or 
corrective action (e.g. , transfusions, initiation of antibiotics or other treatment regimens, 
hydration, study drug placed on hold) is required or the event is deemed clinically 
Superseding Amendment  4: 07 March  2017   CONFIDENTIAL  
Onyx Therapeutics, Inc.  Clinical Study Protocol No . 20140355  
Carfilzomib  Page 73 of 165 
significant by the treating physician.   Where applicable, clinical sequelae (not the 
laboratory abnormality) are to be recorded  as the AE. 
12.1.3 DURATION 
The start and stop date s for all AEs will be recorded.  The start date is the first date that 
the subject was aware of the AE and the end date is the date that the event has changed in 
grade, totally resolved , or returned to baseline.  Any changes in grade should be recorded 
as a separate event.  Terms such as “intermittent” or “occasional” are not appropriate 
descriptions of AEs; each time a full calendar  day elapses without the subject 
experiencing the event should result in the event stop date recorded and a new event reported if the event recurs.   
12.1.4 
CAUSALITY 
A relationship between study drug and an adverse event is considered causal if there is at 
least a reasonable possibility the adverse event was caused by carfilzomib administration, 
i.e., the relationship cannot be ruled out.  The relationship of the AE to the study drug should be assessed by the investigator taking into account the totality of the e vidence and 
in considering the variables listed below. 
The following criteria should be considered and would support a positive assessment of 
causality:   
• Time to onset plausible: There is a clinically plausible time sequence between the 
AE onset and admini stration of study treatment. 
• Biologic plausibility: There is a biologically plausible mechanism for the study 
treatment to cause or contribute to the AE .  Biologic plausibility should be 
evaluated but is not required for a positive causality assessment.  F or example, if 
there is lack of an alternative explanation for the adverse event, then a causal relationship may be positive pending a complete causality assessment.  
• Positive dechallenge or rechallenge: The event improves or diminishes upon 
withdrawal of t he study drug without the initiation of any specific treatment for 
the event (dechallenge) and/or recurs or worsens with rechallenge (when clinically feasible) . 
• Alternative explanation or confounding factors do not suggest another etiology for 
the AE: The role of concurrent or underlying illness, co- medication, procedures 
or other events need to be evaluated as possible causes of or contributing to the 
adverse event.

The following criteria should be considered and would support a non- causal association 
betw een drug administration and the adverse event. 
• The AE is more likely to be explained by the subject’s clinical state, underlying 
disease, concomitant medication, study or non- study procedure.  
• The amount, duration of exposure , or time of last dose prior to the event suggests 
the AE is not reasonably related to administration of study treatment.  
12.2 ADVERSE EVENTS REPORTING PROCEDURES  
12.2.1 GENERAL  
All AEs (e.g. , any new event or worsening in severity or frequency of a pre- existing 
condition or laboratory finding) with an onset date after the subject signs the informed 
consent for participation in the clinical trial must be promptly documented on the AE 
eCRF via the electronic data capture ( EDC ) system .  Details of the event must include 
severity, relationship to study drug(s), duration, action taken, and, for SAEs only, outcome.  Whenever  possible, reporting specific diagnose s is preferr ed when reporting 
AEs in the AE  eCRF rather than reporting individual signs and symptoms. 
All AEs will be collected from the time the s ubject signs informed consent through 
30 days  after receiving the last dose of study drug(s) .  If initiation of new anticancer 
therapy occurs within 30 days  following the last dose of study drug(s), the date of new 
anticancer therapy will be recorded on the appropriate eCRF .  In addition, the 
investigator should report any AEs that may occur after this time period which are 
assessed to have a reasonable possibility of being associated with study drug.  
All AEs that are considered related  to study drug and al l SAEs regardless of relationship 
to study drug must be followed to resolution or stabilization if improvement is not 
expected .  Adverse events which completely resolve and then recur should be recorded as 
new AE s.  For subjects who complete the EOT visit less than 30 days  following the last 
dose of study drug, a follow-up of ongoing AEs should be documented in the subject’s 
source file.  Adverse events continuing at 30 days  after the last dose of study treatment 
should have a comment in the source file by the investigator that the event has stabilized or is not expected to improve.

Onyx Therapeutics, Inc.  Clinical Study Protocol No . 20140355  
Carfilzomib  Page 75 of 165 
The investigator is responsible for evaluating all AEs, obtaining supporting source 
documents, and determining that documentation of the event is adequate.  The 
investigator may delegate these duties to subinvestigators and must ensure that these 
subinvestigators are qualified to perform these duties under the supervision of the 
investigator and that they are listed on the FDA Form 1572. 
12.3 SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT DEFINITION  
An SAE is an AE that meets 1 or more of the following criteria:  
• Death   
• Life-threatening experience defined as any adverse experience that places the 
subject, in the view of the Sponsor or investigator, at immediate risk of death at 
the time of occurrence ( i.e., it does not include a reaction that, had it occurred in 
a more severe form, might have caused death ). 
• Requires in -subject  hospitalization or prolongation of an existing hospitalization 
(except scheduled hospitalizations for a nonacute, unrelated cause such as elective surgery) . 
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (i.e. , substantial disruption 
in a subject’s ability to conduct normal activities of daily living [ADL] ). 
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect in the offspring of an exposed fema le subject 
or offspring of a female partner of a male subject . 
• Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or 
require hospitalization, may be considered a SAE when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, jeopardizes the subject and may require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent 1 of the outcomes listed in this definition. 
12.4 SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING AND DOCUMENTATION 
REQUIREMENTS  
Amgen Global Patient Safety must be notified of the occurrence of any SAE within 
24 hours of the investigator, designee, or site personnel’s knowledge of the event.  The 
SAE will be reported by completing and submitting the SAE report form through the 
EDC system.  In the event that the EDC system is not available, paper SAE report forms  
may be used to report the SAE to Amgen Global Patient Safety  (Appendix  L).  Please 
refer to the SAE Reporting Guidelines in the study reference manual.   
Follow-up reports must be submitted in a timely fashion as additional information 
becomes available.  
Superseding Amendment  4: 07 March  2017   CONFIDENTIAL  
Onyx Therapeutics, Inc.  Clinical Study Protocol No . 20140355  
Carfilzomib  Page 76 of 165 
The investigator is responsible for notifying the Institutional Review Board (IRB) or 
Independent Ethics Committees (IEC), in accordance with local regulations, of all SAEs.  
The Sponsor may request for additional source documentation pertaining to the SAE 
from the investigational site.  If a subject is permanently withdrawn from the study due to an SAE, this information must be included in the initial or follow -up SAE report in the 
eCRF.  
The Sponsor is responsible for notifying the appropriate global health authorities of 
SAEs, when  required, in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. 
Properly anonymized and de-identified documents (e.g., hospital discharge summaries, 
autopsy reports, and/or death certificates), as available will be provided to Amgen Global 
Patient  Safety . 
12.5 PREGNANCY AND LACTATION EXPOSURE REPORTING  
Pregnancy, although not considered an SAE, must be reported to Amgen Global Patient 
Safety within 24 hours of the investigator’s awareness, if the pregnancy has occurred  
within 30 days of study treatment (for female participants) or within 90 days of study treatment (for female partners of male participant s).  The pregnancy will be reported on a 
Pregnancy Notification Worksheet ( APPENDIX  M).  Amgen Global Patient Safety will 
follow-up with the investigator regarding additional information that may be requested. 
If a subject becomes pregnant while taking an Amgen  drug, the study treatment  will be 
immediately discontinued.  The investigator will discuss the risks and concerns of 
investigational drug exposure to a developing fetus and counsel the subject and/or 
pregnant partner (or ensure that such counseling is provided). 
Pregnancies will be followed through th e outcome of the pregnancy. 
If the outcome of the pregnancy meets a criterion for immediate classification as an SAE  
(e.g., spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, neonatal death, fetal or neonatal congenital 
anomaly), the investigator will report the event as an SAE.  
With authorization of the subject or female partner, newborns should be followed-up at 6 
and 12 months of age .

Carfilzomib  Page 77 of 165 
If a female subject breastfeeds during treatment with carfilzomib or up to 30  days 
following the last dose of study drug administration,  the investigator will notify Amgen 
Global Patient Safety within 24 hours of learning of her breastfeeding.  The investigator 
will discuss the risks and concerns of breastfeeding while taking an IP.  The subject will 
be required to either discontinue breas tfeeding or study treatment.  The investigator will 
complete a Lactation Notification Worksheet ( APPENDIX  N).  Amgen Gl obal Patient 
Safety will follow -up with the investigator regarding additional information that may be 
requested.  
12.6 DEATH  REPORTING  
All deaths that occur from signing of informed consent until 30 days  after the last dose of 
study drug are to be reported as SAEs (unless due to PD - refer to  Section 12.4).  
Deaths occurring after the EOT visit do not need to be reported as SAEs.  Additional 
details of the event (such as the primary and contributory causes of death) should be reported on the end of study eCRF.  
13 STATISTIC AL CONSIDERATIONS  
This section describes th e statistical considerations of the study design and summarizes 
the statistical analyses that will be conducted to assess the efficacy and safety endpoints 
in the study .  Further details will be provided separately in the Statistical Analysis Plan 
(SAP) .  If, after the study has begun, but prior to the final analysis, important changes are 
made to the primary or key secondary analyses, then the changes will be reflected in the SAP or its amendment where applicable.  The study protocol may be amended as 
appropriate.  Any other changes made to the planned analyses after the protocol and SAP 
have been finalized, along with an explanation as to when and why they occurred, will be described in the c linical study report, in which any post hoc exploratory analyses also 
will be clearly identified .  Any changes made in the analysis plan , after the primary 
inferential c omparisons between treatment groups are performed , will be exploratory in 
nature.

13.1 STUDY ENDPOINTS  
13.1.1 PRIMARY ENDPOINTS  
The primary endpoint is PFS, which is defined as the time in months from 
randomization to the earlier of disease progression  or death due to any cause . 
13.1.2 SECONDARY ENDPOINTS  
The secondary endpoints of the study are as follows: 
• ORR, defined as the proportion of subjects who achieved a confirmed  PR, 
VGPR, CR, or sCR, according to the IMWG- URC. 
• OS defined as the time in months from randomization to death due to any cause. 
• Safety and tolerability  
• Sparse PK  
13.2 STUDY POPULATIONS  
13.2.1 INTENT -TO-TREAT POPULATION  
The Intent -to-Treat (ITT) P opulation consists of all randomized subjects .  It will be the 
basis for the analysis of efficacy endpoints in this study .  Subjects in the analysis based 
on the ITT Population will be included in the treatment group to which they were 
randomized. 
13.2.2 SAFETY ANALYSIS POPULATION  
The Safety Population is defined as all randomized subjects who received at least 1 dose 
of any study drug (i.e., carfilzomib, dexamethasone).  Subjects in the analysis based on the 
Safety Population will be included in the treatment group corresponding to the actual treatment received . 
13.3 STATISTICAL METHODS  
13.3.1 
ANALYSIS OF THE CONDUCT OF THE STUDY  
The number of subjects screened, randomized, and treated will be presented.  The number 
and percentage of subjects excluded from each analysis population will be summar ized 
with reason s for exclusion.  The number of subjects who discontinue study treatment will 
be tabulated, along with the reason for discontinuation.

Onyx Therapeutics, Inc.  Clinical Study Protocol No . 20140355  
Carfilzomib  Page 79 of 165 
Subjects’ demographics and baseline characteristics, disease characteristics, prior and 
concomitant med ications, and study drug exposure and treatment compliance  will be 
summarized descriptively for each treatment group. 
The number and percentage of subjects with important protocol deviations will be 
summarized by treatment group. 
13.3.2 EFFICACY ANALYSES  
All effi cacy analyses will be based on the ITT Population, which consists of all subjects 
randomized. 
13.3.2.1 Primary Efficacy Endpoint 
The primary efficacy endpoint is PFS.  Progression- free survival will be calculated 
from the time of randomization until disease progres sion or death due to any cause, 
whichever occurs first.  If a subject is alive or lost to follow- up without experiencing 
documented disease progression by the data cutoff date, the PFS data for the subject 
will be censored at the date of last valid disease and response assessment.  Detailed 
PFS data censoring rules will be described in the SAP.  
The distribution of PFS, including median, will be estimated using the 
Kaplan- Meier method.  Progression -free survival rates at selected time points will 
be reported  by treatment group.  The 95% CI for the median and other percentiles 
of PFS will be constructed using the method of Klein and Moeschberger (1997)  with 
log-log transformation.  The 95% CIs for PFS rates were estimated using the 
method by  Kalbfleisch and Pr entice (1980)  with log -log transformation.  The 
inferential comparison between treatment groups will be made using the log -rank 
test stratified by the randomization stratification factors specified in  Section  7.  The 
hazard ratio ( HR) and its 95% CI will be estimated using a Cox proportional 
hazards model stratified by the same randomization stratification factors.  Duration of follow up for PFS will be estimated using the reverse Kaplan -Meier method 
(Schemper  1996; Smith  2006).  
Response and disease progression will be determined using a validated computer 
algorithm (Onyx Response Computational Assessment; [ORCA ]), as well as by local

median , will be estimated using the Kaplan- Meier method on the basis of  subjects 
who achieve overall response.  
13.3.2.2.2 Overall Survival 
Overall Survival will be analyzed using the same methods as for PFS.  
Overall Survival data will be right- censored at the earlier of last known alive date or data 
cutoff date for subjects who are still alive.   
The analysis of OS will be co nducted at the time of the PFS analysis (interim or 
final ), only if both PF S and ORR analyses are positive, per hierarchical testing 
procedures.  There will be  no interim analysis for OS.  Additional follow -up for OS 
may be performed.  
13.3.2.3 Control of Family- wise Type I Error Rate  
The null hypotheses for the primary efficacy endpoint, PFS , and secondary efficacy 
endpoints ( ORR and OS) will be tested using a fixed sequence hierarchical testing 
procedure to control the family- wise Type I Error rate below 1 -sided 0.025 level.  The 
family of hypotheses is ordered as follows: 1) PFS, 2) ORR, and 3) OS.  Starting with 
the hypothesis of PFS, if any hypothesis in the sequence is rejected at a 1 -sided 
significance level of 0.025, then the subsequent hypothesis will be test ed; if any 
hypothesis is accepted, then the subsequent hypotheses will not be tested. 
13.3.3 SAFETY ANALYSIS  
Safety analyses will be based on the S afety Population (defined as all randomized 
subjects who have received at least 1 dose of study treatment) . 
13.3.3.1 Adverse Events  
Treatment -emergent adverse events are defined as AEs that start on or after the first day 
study treatment is administered and within 30  days  of the last administration of study 
treatment .  The reported AE term will be coded using MedDRA and will be graded for 
severity using NCI -CTCAE V ersion  4.03.  The causal relationship between the 
occurrence of an AE and each treatment will be assessed by the investigator as related or 
not related.  
Superseding Amendment  4: 07 March  2017   CONFIDENTIAL  
Onyx Therapeutics, Inc.  Clinical Study Protocol No . 20140355  
Carfilzomib  Page 82 of 165 
Treatment -emergent adverse events  will be summarized based on the number and 
percentage of subjects experiencing events by treatment group and by MedDRA system 
organ class  (SOC) and preferred term .  In the event that a patient experiences repeated 
episodes of the same AE, the subject will be counted once within each SOC  and similarly 
counted once within each preferred term and the event with the highest severity grade 
and/or strongest causal relationship to each treatment will be used for purposes of 
incidence tabulations. 
Tabular summaries of the following will be provid ed: 
• All TEAEs  by SOC  
• All TEAEs in decreasing order of frequency 
• TEAEs by causal relationship to study drug  
• TEAEs by maximum severity grade  
• All SAEs  by SOC  
• All SAEs in decreasing order of frequency  
• TEAEs resulting in modification  (i.e., dose reduction or dose interruption) of 
study treatment  
• TEAEs resulting in discontinuation of study treatment 
• Deaths within 30 days  of the last administration of study treatment  
• All AEs, including TEAEs, will be included in individual patient listings.  
13.3.3.2 Safety Laboratory Values  
For hematology, chemistry, and other laboratory values , the baseline values , changes 
from baseline by visit, the minimum, maximum, and last observed values will be 
summarized descriptively . 
For the summary of changes from baseline by visit,  subjects w ithout a base line and/or 
post baseline value will be excluded; values from unscheduled assessments will be 
excluded.  Subjects with missing data for a scheduled assessment  time point will be 
excluded from the summary for that time point.  Laboratory results from samples taken > 30 days  after the last administration of protocol therapy will be excluded from the 
laboratory summaries .

Onyx Therapeutics, Inc.  Clinical Study Protocol No . 20140355  
Carfilzomib  Page 83 of 165 
All available laboratory data, including those excluded from summary tabulations, will be 
included in individual patient listin gs. 
Laboratory test results will be grade d using the NCI- CTCAE  (Version 4.03).  Shifts in 
laboratory toxicity grades to outside the normal range will be evaluated for selected  
laboratory parameter s by assessing the maximum increase and/or decrease observed  
during the course of study treatment relative to the baseline toxicity grade.  
The subject incidence of Grade 3 and 4 hematological laboratory abnormalit ies 
(including neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia) will be provided by treatment 
group. 
The subject incidence of Grade 3 and 4 nonhematological laboratory abnormalit ies 
(including liver function test [LFT], CrCl) will be provided by treatment group.  Similar 
analyses will be done for selected chemistry tests . 
13.3.3.3 Vital Signs  
Vital sign results (systolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulse, respiratory rate,  and 
temperature) will be summarized descriptively for baseline values and changes from 
baseline to the minimum, maximum, and last observed values.   
For the summary of changes from baseline by visit , subjects without a base line and/or 
past-baseline value will be excluded; values from unscheduled assessments will be 
excluded .  Vital sign results  taken > 30 days  after the last administration of protocol 
therapy will be excluded from all  vital sign  summaries . 
13.3.4 SPARSE PHARMACOKINET IC ANALYSES  
A sparse PK sampling strategy will be employed in this study , at a subset of study sites .  
Blood samples will be collected at specified times, processed and stored until analysis .  
Concentrations of carfilzomib will be measured in plasma using a validated assay 
method. 
The population pharmacokinetic analysis will be a cumulative analysis that will include 
population pharmacokinetic data obtained from previous Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies that

used intensive or sparse PK  sampling .  The analysis plan as well as a stand -alone 
pharmacokinetic analysis report will be prepared separately .  The population modeling 
program may be used to fit a nonlinear mixed effects model to estimate PK parameters , 
including clearance and volume of distribution, the inter- and intra- subject variability , 
and the population variability in the parameter estimates.  The PK concentrations 
obtained from subjects who participate in the sparse PK sampling, along with results 
from the intensive PK/PDn substudy and other carfilzomib studies, will be used in the 
development of a structural model.  The best model will be evaluated by goodness-of- fit 
statistics and reduction in the objective function and posterior predictive checks.  Subject characteristics such as age, gender, body weight, BSA, and race will be included in the 
model to identify potential covariates affecting PK of carfilzomib.  
Additional analyses may be performed to evaluate the relationship between the estimated PK parameters and selected safety  or clinical effect endpoints. 
13.3.5 
EXPLORATORY ANALYSES   
Exploratory analyses will be performed for the following endpoints: 
• PDn and PK endpoints 
o To characterize the PK and PDn of proteasome inhibition in both treatment 
groups in a subset of subjects.  Actua l collection times will be recorded and 
used in the analysis.  For the intensive PK/PDn substudy, individual and 
mean plasma concentration versus time data will be tabulated and plotted by 
dose level.  The PK parameter will be estimated based on noncompart mental 
methods.  The PK parameter estimates for carfilzomib will be summarized, 
including total plasma exposure (AUC, Cmax, time to maximum plasma 
concentration [tmax], total plasma clearance, and t1/2 [as appropriate for data collected]).  Estimates for these parameters will be tabulated and 
summarized (i.e., mean, standard deviation).  These estimates will be 
summarized descriptively by each arm.   
• Patient -reported outcomes 
o All subscales of the EORTC  QLQ -C30, and the EORTC QLQ- MY20  
o EQ-5D- 5L: a standardized measure of health status developed by the 
EuroQol Group  
o Patient -reported convenience and satisfaction  
• Healthcare resource utilization

13.4 HANDLING OF DATA  
13.4.1 HANDLING MISSING DATA IN DESCRIPTIVE ANALYSES  
When summarizing categorical variables, subjects with missing data are generally not  
included in calculations of percentages unless otherwise specified .  When needed , the 
category of “Missing” is created and the number of subjects  with missing data is  
presented.  
When summarizing continuous variables, subjects with missing data are n ot included in 
calculations.  No imputations are made. 
13.4.2 HANDLING MISSING OR PARTIAL LY MISSING D ATES  
Missing or partially missing dates will not be imputed at data level.  However, 
assumptions for missing or partially missing dates for important variables will be made to 
allow inclusion of appropriate data records in the analyses.  In general, the assumptions 
about the missing or partially missing dates, when needed, are made conservative to 
avoid overestimation of treatment effect and undere stimation of adverse effects.  
If a medication date or  time is missing or partially missing, and it cannot be determined 
whether it was taken prior or  concomitantly, it will be consider ed as a prior, concomitant, 
and a post- treatment medication.  
If the partial AE onset date information does not indicate whether the AE started prior to 
treatment or after the TEAE period, the AE will be  classified as treatment -emergent . 
If the start day of subsequent anticancer therapy is missing, it will be assumed to be the 
first day of the  month. 
If only the day of a death date is missing, the death will be assumed to be on the first day of the month if the last known alive date is earlier.  If the last known alive date is later 
than the first day of the month, then the death date will be assumed to be the last known 
alive date plus 1 day.

including the roles and responsibilities of the involved parties, will be described in 
the IRC Charter.  
13.7 DATA MONITORING COMM ITTEE  
An independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will be convened for this study and 
will act in an advisory capacity to the sponsor with respect to safeguarding the interests 
of study subjects through periodic safety data reviews , assessments of interim safety and 
efficacy data, and monitoring of the overall conduct of the study.  To enhance the 
integrity of the study, the DMC may also formulate recommendations relating to the 
selection, recruitment, and retention of subjects, their management, improving adherence 
to protocol treatment, and the procedures for data management and quality control.   
An Independent Statistical Reportin g Group (ISRG) will function independently of the 
Sponsor s tudy team , in support of the DMC.  The ISRG will conduct unblinded analyses, 
generate the open and closed reports to be reviewed at the DMC meetings, and serve as 
the liaison between the Sponsor an d the DMC. 
The details of the DMC , including the roles and responsibilities of the involved parties, 
will be described in the DMC Charter .   
The DMC will meet to review safety data on a periodic basis, including after 
approximately 40 subjects have completed ≥ 1 cycle and no less frequently than 
approximately every  6 months thereafter.  Unplanned safety review meetings of the DMC 
may be called at any time , if warranted , for an earlier review of safety data.   The DMC 
will also review the interim PFS analysis re sults and recommend whether the study 
should stop early for efficacy.  
13.8 INTERIM ANALYSIS  
Periodic safety review will be conducted by the DMC.  
One interim analysis will be conducted for PFS when  approximately 263 (75% of total 
350) PFS events are observed.  The objective of the interim analysis is to  monitor for 
differences between treatment arms for evidence of a substantial benefit in the 
carfilzomib once- weekly with dexamethasone arm .

of 24 hour urine sample for UPEP and immunofixation and confirmed to be negative.  
• If present at baseline, a ≥  50% reduction in the size of soft tissue plasmacytomas is 
also required.  
PRb • ≥ 50% reduction of serum M -protein and reduction in 24- hour urinary M -protein by 
≥ 90% or to < 200 mg/ 24 h  
• If the serum and urine M -protein are unmeasurable, a ≥  50% decrease in the difference 
between involved and uninvolved FLC levels is required in pl ace of the M -protein 
criteria.  
• If serum and urine M -protein are not measureable, and serum free light assay is also 
not measureable, ≥  50% reduction in plasma cells is required in place of M -protein, 
provided baseline bone marrow cell percentage was ≥  30% 
• If present at baseline, a ≥  50% reduction in the size of soft tissue plasmacytomas is 
also required

PDb Any on e or more of the following:  
• Increase of ≥  25% from lowest response value in:  
o Serum M -component and/or (the absolute increase must be ≥  0.5 g/dL)  
o Urine M -component and/or (the absolute increase must be ≥  200 mg/24  h) 
o Only in patients without measurable ser um and urine M -protein levels; the 
difference between involved and uninvolved FLC levels.  The absolute increase 
must be >10 mg/dL  
o Bone marrow plasma cell percentages  (absolute percentage must be ≥  10%)

2.65mmol/L) that can be attributed solely to the plasma cell proliferative disorder  
Source:  Durie 2006; Rajkumar 2011  (modified for protocol purposes ). 
CR = complete response; sCR = stringent complete response; FLC = serum light chain; PD = progressive 
disease; PR  = partial response; SFLC = serum free light chain; VGPR = very good partial response . 
Note: For patients without measurable protein on UPEP at baseline, UPEP will need to be repeated to confirm a 
response of VGPR or better.  
a Patients  with measurable disease in both serum (SPEP) and urine (UPEP) at study entry are required to 
meet response criteria in both UPEP and SPEP in order to qualify for a MR or better.  Conversely, it should 
be noted that criteria for PD only needs to be met, and confirmed, in one parameter.  
b All response categories (CR, sCR, VGPR, PR) require 2 consecutive assessments  made at any time before 
the institution of any new therapy, as well as no known evidence of progressive or new bone lesions if 
radiographic studies were performed.  Radiographic studies are not required to satisfy these response 
requirements.  Bone marrow, plasmacytoma, and skeletal survey assessments are not required to be 
confirmed by repeat testing.  SD requires a duration of ≥ 6 weeks.  
c Presence/absence of clonal cells is based upon the κ/λ ratio.  An abnormal κ/λ ratio by 
immunohistochemistry and/or immunofluorescence requires a minimum of 100 plasma cells for analysis.  
An abnormal ratio reflecting presence of an abnormal clone is κ/λ of > 4:1 or < 1:2. 
d Determination of PD while on study requires 2 consecutive assessments made at any time before 
classification of PD and/or the institution of new therapy.  Serum M -component increases of ≥ 1 g/dL from 
nadir are sufficient to def ine progression if nadir M -component is ≥ 5 g/dL.   
e Plasmacytomas: A definite increase in the size is defined as a ≥ 50% increase as measured serially by the 
sum of the products of the cross -diameters of the measurable lesion.  A plasmacytoma is considered  
measurable if the longest diameter is at least 1 cm and the product of the cross diameters is at least 1 cm2.  
Plasmacytomas of lesser size will be considered non -measurable.   
f The requirement for bi -directional measurements applies only to plasmacytomas.  
g The plasmacytoma specifications for PD are based on the Sponsor’s interpretation of the IMWG -URC and 
practical considerations for study execution.  
h In patients with sFLC measurable disease only, normal sFLC ratio is required for CR.

APPENDIX K COUNTRY SPECIFIC PREGNANCY AND 
CONTRACEPTIVE SUPPLE MENT  
A woman of childbearing pote ntial (WOCBP) is defined as:  
Any woman who has experienced menarche and is not postmenopausal or permanently 
sterilized.  Permanent sterilization methods include hysterectomy, bilateral 
salpingectomy, and bilateral oophorectomy.  
A postmenopausal woman is defined as:  
• Age > 55 years with cessation of menses for 12 or more months 
• Age < 55 years but no spontaneous menses for at least 2 years 
• Age < 55 years and spontaneous menses within the past 1 year, but currently 
amenorrheic (e.g., spontaneous or secondary to hysterectomy), and with 
postmenopausal gonadotropin levels (luteinizing hormone and 
follicle -stimulating hormone levels > 40 IU/L) or postmenopausal estradiol 
levels ( < 5 ng/dL) or according to the definition of "postmenopausal range" for 
the laboratory involved. 
• Underwent a bilateral oophorectomy 
Pregnancy Prevention Information 
Female Subjects  
Highly effective methods of birth control are defined as methods that achieve a failure 
rate of less than 1% per year when used consistently and correctly.  
WOCBP must use a highly effective method of birth control during treatment and for an 
additional 30 days after the last dose of protocol-required therapies.  Highly effective 
methods of birth control for female participants or their male partner include : 
• Combined (estrogen and progestogen) hormonal methods:  pills, vaginal ring, or 
skin patch. 
• Single hormonal methods (progestogen to stop the release of the egg from the 
ovary): pills, shots/injections, implants (placed under the skin by a healthcare 
provider) 
• Intrauterine device (IUD)  
• Intrauterine hormonal- releasing system (IUS)  surgery to tie both fallopian tubes 
(bilateral tubal ligation/occlusion)

• Vasectomised partner:  Provided the partner is the sole sexual partner of the 
WOCBP trial participant and that the vasectomized partner has received 
medical assessment of the surgical success.  
• Sexual abstinence:  Refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire 
period of risk associated with the study treatment.  The reliability of sexual 
abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the clinical trial and with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject.  
Male Subjects  
If the male subjects sole female partner has received medical confirmation that she is 
postmenopausal or she has had a p ermanent sterilization method (hysterectomy, bilateral 
oophorectomy, or bilateral salpingectomy) or the male subject has had a vasectomy with medical confirmation of surgical success, or his sole female partner has had a bilateral 
tubal ligation/occlusion,  additional contraceptive methods are not required during this 
study.  Otherwise, if the male subject’s female partner could become pregnant, the male 
must:  
• Practice true sexual abstinence.  (Refraining from heterosexual intercourse during 
treatment and f or an additional 90 days following the last dose of study drug 
administration.  The reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in 
relation to the duration of the clinical trial and be the preferred and usual 
lifestyle of the subject.)  
Or 
• Use a condom with spermicide during treatment and for an additional 90 days 
following the last dose of study drug administration.  (Note a condom without 
spermicide is acceptable in countries where spermicide is not commercially 
available.)

APPENDIX  O SUMMARY OF CHANGES F OR PROTOCOL 
AMENDMENT  4 AND FOR SUPERSEDING PROTOCOL  AMENDMENT  4 
Protocol Title:   A Randomized, Open- label, Phase 3 Study in Subjects with Relapsed 
and Refractory Multiple Myeloma Receiving Carfilzomib in Combination with 
Dexamethasone, Comparing Once- weekly versus Twice- weekly Carfilzomib Dosing 
 
Amgen Protocol Number 20140355 (formerly CFZ0 14) 
 
Amendment D ate: 07 March  2017 
Rationale: 
In Protocol Amendment 4, t he protocol is amended to: 
• Switch progression-free survival (PFS) from a key secondary objective/endpoint 
to the primary objective /endpoint and overall response rate (ORR) from the 
primary objective/endpoint to a key secondary objective/endpoint 
Rationale: This study was originally designed with ORR as the primary endpoint 
because response rates, especially high -quality responses of substantial duration, 
are important indicators of benefit in relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma.  
However, recent advances in antimyeloma therapy have altered the landscape such that PFS is now considered to be the more relevant regulatory endpoint in this setting.  To support regulatory interactions and protect the integrity of the 
PFS data, the primary endpoint has been  amended to PFS, with ORR as a key 
secondary endpoint. 
• Change the purpose and timing of the interim PFS analysis 
Rationale: The purpose and timing of the interim PFS analysis were amended to monitor ef ficacy and allow the possibility of stopping the trial early for effic acy. 
• Revise statistical language to align with changes in objectives/endpoints and 
purpose and timing of the interim PFS analysis 
• Update Table 12 (Stopping Boundaries for P rogression -free Survival) 
• Allow the possibility for long -term follow -up for overall survival 
• Add Section  4.4.1 (End of Study) 
• Add Section 8.4 (Product Complaints) 
• Update Table 5 (Carfilzomib Dose Modifications for Nonhematologic Toxicity)

• Add Section 9.4.2.5 (Thromboprophylaxis) 
• Add the following forms in the Appendices 
o Sample Serious Adverse Event Report Form  
o Pregnancy Notification Form  
o Lactation Notification Form 
• Update Section 2 (Background Information)  
• Correct an error in the study schema inserted into Protocol Amendment 4 (thereby 
creating a Superseding Amendment 4)  
• Make minor text clarifications, a dditions, corrections, and edits throughout the 
protocol 
In Superseding Protocol Amendment 4, the protocol is amended to: 
• Correct an error in the dexamethasone dosing in the study schema inserted into Protocol Amendment 4 
• Make minor edits throughout the protocol

The total study accrual period is expected to be approximately 15 months.  T he data cut off date 
for the primary analysis of ORR  will be 
approximately 4 months after the last subject is randomized.  Subjects will be followed for disease and survival status until approximately 350 PFS events are observed, which is expected to occur  approximately 25 months after the first 
subject is randomized.  These durations are estimated based upon the assumptions of median PFS of 8.2 months in the once -
weekly dosing arm 
and 6 months in the twice -weekly dosing arm

4.4.1  END OF STUDY 
Primary Completion: The primary completion 
date is defined as the date when the last subject is assessed or receives an intervention for the final collection of data for the primary endpoint(s), for the purposes of conducting the primary analysis, whether the study concluded as planned in the protocol or was termi nated 
early.    
The primary completion is anticipated to occur 
when approximately 350 PFS events occur or end of year 2018, whichever is earlier.  The 
primary completion date is the date when data for the p rimary endpoint are last collected for 
the purpose s of conducting the primary 
analysis  or the end of year 2018, whichever is 
earlier.   
If the study concludes prior to the primary completion date originally planned in the protocol (i .e., early termination of the study), 
then the primary completion will be the date 
when the last subject is assessed or receives an intervention for evaluation in the study (i .e., 
last subject last visit).  
End of Study: The end of study date is defined as the date when the last subject across all sites is assessed or receives an  intervention for 
evaluation in the study (i .e., last subject last 
visit), following any additional parts in the study (e .g., long -term follow -up), as applicable.  Addition of section for end

The primary efficacy endpoint is ORR.  The data 
cutoff date for the analysis of ORR is about 4 months after the last sub ject is randomized 
(approximately 19 month after the first subject was randomized).  The inferential comparison of ORR between treatment groups will be made using a logistic regression model -based test 
against the null hypothe sis that the odds ratio is  
≤ 1 at a 1 -sided significance level of 0.025.  The 
regression model will include the randomization stratification factors as covariates:  
• ISS stage at study entry (Stage 1 versus 
Stage 2 and 3)  
• Refractory to bortezomib treatment (Yes 
versus No)  
• Age (<  65 versus ≥ 65 years)

The distribution of PFS, including median, w ill 
be estimated using the Kaplan- Meier method.  
Progression -free survival rates at selected time 
points will be reported by treatment group.  The 95% CI for the median and other percentiles of PFS will be constructed using the method of Klein and Moeschbe rger (1997) 
with log -log transformation.  The 95% CIs for 
PFS rates were estimated using the method by Kalbfleisch and Prentice (1980) with log -log 
transformation.  The inferential comparison between treatment groups will be made using the log -rank test st ratified by the

Final analysis of OS will occur at the time of final 
PFS analysis.  Under the a ssumptions that the 
accrual will take about 15 months and the median OS is 14 months in the twice weekly dosing group and 17 months in the once -weekly dosing 
group (HR = 0.82), it is estimated that approximately 245 deaths will be observed at the time of t he final PFS analysis (approximately 
25 months after the first subject randomized).  An 
interim analysis of OS will occur at the time of ORR analysis.  The details of OS interim analysis are in Section 13.8 . Add:  
The analysis of OS will be conducted at the

Section: 13.8 INTERIM  
ANALYSIS, Paragraphs 2 -3 Replace:  
One interim analysis will be conducted for PFS 
and OS at the time of the analysis of ORR, which is expected to occur approximately 19  months 
after the first subject is randomized.  It  is 
estimated that approximately 262 (75% of total 350) PFS events and 171 OS events will be observed at the interim analysis.  The primary objective of the interim an alysis of PFS and OS is 
to provide necessary data to help assess the results from the analysis of the primary endpoint ORR, and it is intended that all subjects will continue to be followed for disease assessment and survival status until 350 PFS events ar e 
observed, given a positive result of the ORR analysis.  
To ensure proper control of type I error rate, the interim and final analysis of PFS and OS will be analyzed under a group sequential design framework with the stopping boundaries constructed using the alpha -spending function 
approach.  Based on the objective of the interim analysis and the considerations above, a 1 -sided 
error level of 0.0001 is assigned to the interim analysis and the remaining 1 -side error level of 
0.0249 is reserved for the final analysis.  The 
stopping boundaries are calculated using East 5.4 
and presented in  Table 12.  With:  
One interim analysis will be conducted for PFS  
when approximately 263  (75% of total 350) PFS 
events are observed.  The objective of the interim 
analysis is to  monitor for differences between 
treatment arms for evidence of a substantial 
benefit in the carfilzomib once- weekly with 
dexamethasone arm.  
To ensure proper control of type I error rate, the interim and final analysis of PFS will be analyzed under a group  sequential design framework with 
the stopping boundaries constructed using the  
O’Brien -Fleming type alpha -spending function 
approach.   The stopping boundaries  in an 
example scenario  are calculated using East  6.4 
and presented in  Table 12 .  Actual boundari es 
will be calculated on the basis of observed PFS events up to the data cut -off date for the 
interim analysis.   If the DMC recommends to 
stop the study for efficacy  after reviewing the 
interim analysis results , the sponsor will 
consider stopping the trial  and conclude that 
the carfilzomib once- weekly with 
dexamethasone arm prolongs PFS compared to the carfilzomib twice- weekly with 
dexamethasone arm.

APPENDIX O  SUMMARY OF CHANGES FOR PROTOCOL AMENDMENT 4  
Protocol Title:  A Randomized, Open- label, Phase 3 Study in Subjects with Relapsed 
and Refractory Multiple Myeloma Receiving Carfilzomib in Combination with 
Dexamethasone, Comparing Once- weekly versus Twice- weekly Carfilzomib Dosing  
 
Amgen Protocol Number 20140355 (formerly CFZ0 14) 
 
Amendment Date:  08 February 2017 
Rationale: 
The protocol is amended to: 
• Switch progression -free survival (PFS) from a key secondary objective/endpoint 
to the primary objective /endpoint and overall response rate (ORR) from the 
primary objective/endpoint to a key secondary objective/endpoint 
Rationale: This study was originally designed with ORR as the primary endpoint 
because response rates, especially high -quality responses of substantial duration, 
are important indicators of benefit in relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma.  
However, recent advances in antimyeloma therapy have altered the landscape such that PFS is now considered to be the more relevant regulatory endpoint in this setting.  To support regulatory interactions and protect the integrity of the 
PFS data, the primary endpoint has been  amended to PFS, with ORR as a key 
secondary endpoint.  
• Change the purpose and timing of the interim PFS analysis  
Rationale: The purpose and timing of the interim PFS analysis were amended to monitor efficacy and allow the possibility of stopping the trial early for efficacy. 
• Revise statistical language to align with changes in objectives/endpoints and purpose and timing of the interim PFS analysis 
• Update  Table 12 ( Stopping Boundaries for Progression- free Survival) 
• Allow the possibility for long- term follow -up for overall survival 
• Add Section 4.4.1 (End of Study) 
• Add Section 8.4 (Product  Complaints)  
• Update Table 5 (Carfilzomib Dose Modifications for Nonhematologic Toxicity) 
• Add Section 9.4.2.5 (Thromboprophylaxis) 
• Add the following forms in the Appendices

investigator should assess to the best of his/her ability its relationship to carfilzomib a nd/or 
dexamethasone.  Dose reduction 
guidelines for carfilzomib include guidelines where the dose of carfilzomib is decreased based on the observed toxicity.

should be removed from study treatment.  Exceptions to this must be discussed with the study medical monitor.  
• If the carfilzomib dose is 
reduced, the reduced dose level will be continued for at least 1 complete cycle.  If the reduced dose level is well tolerated for at 
least one complete cycle, the dose level prior to the reduction may be resumed at the investigator’s

CONFIDENTIAL    Protocol Synopsis 
Title:   A Randomized Withdrawal Double-b lind Study of Etanercept Monotherapy Compared to 
Methotrexate Monotherapy for Maintenance of Remission in Subjects With Rheumatoid Arthritis   
Study Phase:   Phase 3 
Indication:  Rheumatoid Arthritis  (RA) 
Primary Objective:   To evaluate the eff icacy  of etanercept monotherapy compared to 
methotrexate monotherapy on maintenance of remission in subjects with RA who were on 
etanercept plus methotrexate therapy .  
Secondary Objective(s):   
• To evaluate the efficacy of etanercept plus methotrexate therapy compared to methotrexate 
monotherapy on maintenance of remission 
• To evaluate the eff icacy  of 1) etanercept monotherapy compared to methotrexate 
monotherapy and 2) etanercept plus methotrexate therapy compared to methotrexate 
monotherapy on:  
o disease activity  
o disease worsening and time to disease worsening  
o remission and time to recapture remission after rescue treatment  
Hypothes is:  Etanercept  monotherapy  is superior to methotrexate monotherapy for maintaining 
remission in subjects with RA who were on etanercept plus methotrexate therapy .  
Primary Endpoint:  S implified Disease Activity Index (SDAI ) remission (≤ 3.3) at week 48 
Secondary Endpoints:   
• SDAI  score and change from baseline at all measured timepoint s 
• Disease activity score (28 joint) calculated using the erythrocyte sedimentation rate formula (DAS- 28-ESR) and change from baseline at all measured timepoints  
• Disease activity score (28 joint) using the C -reactive protein formula ( DAS-28-CRP ) and 
change from baseline at all measured timepoints  
• Clinical Disease Activity Index ( CDAI ) and change from baseline at all measured timepoints  
• SDAI remission (≤ 3.3)  at all measured timepoints  
• Boolean remission at all measured timepoints  
• Disease worsening defined as an SDAI > 3.3 and ≤ 11 during two consecutive visits at least 
2 weeks apart or SDAI > 3.3 and ≤ 11 on three or more separate visits or S DAI > 11 after 
randomization 
• Time to disease worsening defined as an SDAI > 3.3 and ≤ 11 during two consecutive visits at least 2 weeks apart or SDAI > 3.3 and ≤ 11 on three or more separate visits or 
SDAI  >  11 after randomization  
In subjects that receive rescue treatment : 
• Time to recapture SDAI remission after starting rescue treatment  
• SDAI remission at week 48 
Study Design:  This is a multicenter, randomized withdrawal , double- blind controlled study in 
subjects with RA on etanercept plus methotrexate therapy who are in very good disease control 
for 6 months prior to study entry.  The study will consist of a 30- day screening period, a 24- week 
open- label run-in period, a 48- week double- blind treatment period and a 3 0-day safety follow -up 
period.  
Approximately  358 subjects will be enrolled and approximately  250 subjects will be randomly 
assigned in a 2:2:1 ratio to one of three treatment groups:   etanercept 50 mg weekly by 
subcutaneous injection plus  oral placebo for methotrexate (n = 100), oral methotrexate 
Product:  Etanercept 
Protocol Number:  20110186  
Date:  17 October 2017  Page 4 of 74 
CONFIDENTIAL    10 to  25 mg weekly plus placebo for etanercept  (n = 100) and etanercept 50 mg weekly by 
subcutaneous injection plus oral methotrexate 10 to 25 mg weekly  (n = 50). 
Sample Size:   Approximately 358 subjects enrolled and approximately 250 subjects randomized. 
Summary of Subject Eligibility Criteria:  Subjects must be adults with a history of moderate to 
severe RA.  Subjects must be in very good RA disease control for ≥ 6 months and be in remission 
as defined by an SDAI ≤  3.3 at screeni ng and at the end of the run- in period .  Subjects must be 
on etanercept 50 mg per week plus methotrexate therapy for ≥ 6 months prior to the start of th e 
run-in period.  The methotrexate dose must be 10 to 25 mg per week for ≥ 6 months prior to the 
start of the run- in period and the dose must be stable for ≥ 8 weeks prior to the start of the run -in 
period.  If a subject is taking subcutaneous methotrexate they must switch to an equivalent oral 
methotrexate dose of 10 mg to 25 mg weekly and remain on a stable oral dose ≥  8 weeks prior to 
run-in visit  1.  For a full list of eligibility criteria, please refer to Section 4.1 through Section 4.2. 
Investigational Product 
Amgen Investigational Product Dosage and Administration:  Etanercept dosing in the 
planned study follows the recommended label dosing for subjects with RA.   During the run- in 
period open- label etanercept will be provided as a 50- mg pre- filled syringe for injection once 
weekly  for 24 weeks.  Durin g the double- blind treatment period etanercept will be provided as a 
50-mg pre- filled syringe or matching placebo for injection once weekly for 48 weeks .  
See Section  6.2.1 . 
Non-Amgen Investigational Product Dosage and Administration:  Methotrexate dosing will 
be 10 to 25 mg weekly.  During the run- in period methotrexate will be provided as 2. 5 mg tablets 
and will be taken once weekly by oral administration for 24 weeks.  During the double- blind 
treatment period, methotrexate will be supplied as 2.5 mg methotrexate capsules , or as matching 
placebo capsules and will be taken once weekly by oral administration for 48 weeks .  
See Section  6.2.2 . 
Non-investigational Product 
Non-Amgen Non -investigational Product Dosage and Administration:  Folic acid dosing will 
be 5 to 7 mg per investigator judgment  or administration according to local standard of care.  
See Section  6.3. 
Procedures:   Written informed consent must be obtained from all subjects before any screening 
procedures are performed.  The following procedures will occur per the schedule of assessments:  
medical and medication history, physical examination, physical measures, vital  signs, adverse 
event and concomitant medication assessment, tuberculosis testing, pregnancy testing, urinalysis, and blood draw for serum chemistry, hematology, hepatitis B and C testing, CRP and biomarkers , tender and swollen joint assessment and count a nd patient reported outcomes .  For 
a full list of study procedures, including the timing of each procedure, please refer to Section  
7 
and the Schedule of Assessments  (Table 1 ). 
Statistical Considerations:  The primary endpoint for this study is SDAI remission (SDAI ≤ 3.3) 
at week 48.  The proportion of subjects achieving this endpoint will be compared across  treatment 
arms  using the chi -square test .  The etanercept monotherapy  treatment arm will be compared to 
the methotrexate monotherapy arm .  Both subjects who drop out and subjects receiving rescue 
therapy due to disease worsening during the double- blind period will be considered 
non-responders.  Furthermore, the randomized subjects who did not receive any dose of any of 
the investigational products will be considered non- responders in th e primary analysis.  As a 
sensitivity analysis, subjects who receive rescue therapy or drop out will have their post -rescue 
SDAI responses set to missing and a multiple imputation technique to impute these values will be 
employed . 
Summary statistics will be provided for endpoints listed in this protocol.  For categorical 
endpoints, the summary statistics contain the frequency and percentage.  For continuous 
endpoints, the summary statistics contain number of observations , mean, standard deviation, 
standard error, median, minimum, maximum, and 95% confidence interval.  For a full description 
of statistical analysis methods, please refer to Section 10.

2. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
2.1 Disease 
RA is a chronic, systemic, autoimmune, inflammatory disease of unknown etiology that 
primarily affects the joints.  Symptoms include joint stiffness, pain, and swelling that can 
progress to deformities and loss of function of both small and large joints.  RA occurs in approximately 1% of adults worldwide in all races.  Disease onset occurs most often between the ages of 20 and 60 years, with peak occurrence at 40 to 45 years.  The prevalence of RA increases with age in both sexes, and prevalence is higher in women than men, with a ratio of approximately 2.5 to 1.0 ( Alamanos et al, 2006 ).  
2.2 Etanercept (Enbrel) Background 
Tumor Necrosis Factor ( TNF) is a naturally occurring cytokine that is involved in normal 
inflammatory and immune responses.  It plays a role in the inflammatory process of 
Product:  Etanercept 
Protocol Number:  20110186  
Date:  17 October 2017  Page 15 of 74 
CONFIDENTIAL    plaque psoriasis.  Elevated levels of TNF are found in involved tissues and fluids of 
patients with RA , psoriat ic arthritis , ankylosing spondylitis, and plaque psoriasis.  
Two distinct receptors for TNF, a 55 kilodalton protein (p55) and a 75 kilodalton protein 
(p75), exist naturally as monomeric molecules on cell surfaces and in soluble forms.  
Biological activity  of TNF is dependent upon binding to either cell surface TNF receptor.  
Etanercept is a dimeric soluble form of the p75 TNF receptor that can bind 
TNF molecules.   Etanercept inhibits binding of TNF- α and TNF -β (lymphotoxin alpha 
[LT-α]) to cell surface TNF Rs, rendering TNF biologically inactive.  
In many countries, etanercept  is indicated for the treatment of :  (1) moderately to 
severely active RA; (2)  moderately to severely active polyarticular juvenile idiopathic 
arthritis in patients aged 2 and older; (3) psoriatic arthritis; (4) active ankylosing 
spondylitis; and (5) adult patients with chronic moderate to severe plaque psoriasis .  
Refer to the specific section of the investigational brochure or product label for additional 
information related to the phys ical, chemical, and pharmaceutical properties and 
formulation(s).  
2.3 Non-Amgen Medicinal  Product Background :  Methotrexate  
Methotrexate inhibits dihydrofolic acid reductase and interferes with DNA synthesis, 
repair, and cellular replication.  I ts efficacy  in RA is well- established and is traditionally 
used as a first line agent for RA treatment.   Although methotrexate is effective, many 
patients continue to have active disease despite maximum dose therapy.  Methotrexate 
can also be used in combination with other Disease M odifying Antirheumatic Drug 
(DMARD ) including etanercept.  The combination of methotrexate and etanercept for 
treatment of RA is well -established.  
Refer to the regional manufacturer package insert for additional information. 
2.4 Rationale  
Etanercept has become a well- established agent in the management of RA .  It can be 
used either as monotherapy or in combination with methotrexate to treat RA .  Etanercept 
is commonly used in combination therapy after monotherapy with a first line agent such 
as methotrexate has failed.  Patients report lower disease activity and improved quality 
of life with the incorporation of etanercept into their traditional DMARD therapies  
(Klareskog et al , 2004 ). 
Recent studies including PRIZE ( Emery et al , 2012), PRESERVE ( Smolen et al , 2013 ), 
and DOSERA ( van Vollenhoven et al, 2013a), have characterized the role of etanercept 
Product:  Etanercept 
Protocol Number:  20110186  
Date:  17 October 2017  Page 16 of 74 
CONFIDENTIAL    on inducing and maintaining low disease activity in RA  subjects .  Importantly, these 
studies demonstrated that a significantly greater proportion of subjects taking 
combination etanercept plus methotrexate therapy are able to maintain low disease 
states compared to subjects taking methotrexate alone.  The DOSERA study importantly 
demonstrated that most patients whose disease activity worsens after drug withdrawal 
are able to return to low disease activity  (van Vollenhoven et al, 2013b). 
Other studies provide insights regarding the role of etanercept as monotherapy in the maintenance of low disease states.  In the COMET study ( Emery et al , 2010) subjects  
who achieved DAS-28 remission on combination etanercept plus methotrexate were 
randomized to continue the combination therapy or to discontinue methotrexate and be treated with etanercept alone for one year.  There was a numerically greater decrease in the percentage of subjects who maintained remission in the etanercept arm compared to 
the combination arm but the differences were relatively minor.  In the CAMEO study, 
subjects with active RA were treated for 6 months with combination etanercept plus  
methotrexate ( Pope et al , 2013 ).  After 6 months the patients were randomized to 
continue on the combination or to be treated with etanercept monotherapy for the next 18 months.  In patients who achieved low disease activity (DAS -28-ESR < 3.2) at 
month  6, the disease activity at 24 months w as similar whether they discontinued 
methotrexate or remained on combination therapy.  Combination treatment led to lower 
disease activity scores compared to etanercept monotherapy, however, in subjects with 
moderate to high disease activity at randomization (DAS -28-ESR > 3.2).  
Collectively, these studies have shown that etanercept may be required to maintain disease control and that  etanercept may be sufficient as monotherapy in maintaining 
good disease control .  Sustained disease remission with etanercept alone could 
potentially lead to a reduction in polypharmacy  and undesired side effects . 
There are some caveats to these study results that merit consideration.  In the clinical practice setting, drug reduction, whether etanercept or methotrexate , would most likely 
be considered in those patients who have been in good disease control for at least one year in duration.  The clinical trials described above, with the exception of DOSERA which was limited by its small size, were  designed to reduce or withdraw etanercept 
and/or methotrexate soon or just after inducing the target low disease state.  Duration of 
good disease control may be a factor that contributes to the proportion of subjects who 
maintain low disease after drug reduction.  Also, there were differences in the trials on the key low disease activity target for maintenance including DAS -28 Low Disease

CONFIDENTIAL    Activity (L DA) and DAS -28 remission.  Recently, the FDA released a draft guidance 
document for developing drug products  for the treatment of RA (Guidance for Industry 
Rheumatoid Arthritis:  Developing Drug Products for Treatment May 2013) which 
suggested the use of the American College of Rheumatology/European League Against 
Rheumatism criteria for remission.  The criteria include Simplified Disease Activity Index 
(SDAI ) remission (SDAI < 3.3) which is a more stringent measurement of remission 
compared to DAS -28 remission.  SDAI is considered a clinically meaningful and an 
achievable target disease activity state for mainte nance of disease control .   
The present study will evaluate the effectiveness of three separate treatment regimens on maintaining remission of RA  in patients who are well controlled and receiving 
etanercept plus methotrexate therapy for at least 12 months prior to randomization.  The three treatment arms include, etanercept monotherapy, methotrexate monotherapy and 
combination etanercept plus methotrexate therapy .  Subjects who fail to maintain 
remission and have a meaningful increase in the SDAI score duri ng the randomized 
treatment period of the trial will be rescued in a blinded fashion with combination 
etanercept plus methotrexate therapy. 
2.5 Clinical Hypothesis 
Etanercept monotherapy is superior to methotrexate monotherapy for maintaining 
remission in subjects with RA  who were on etanercept plus methotrexate therapy .  
3. EXPERIMENTAL PLAN  
3.1 Study Design 
This is a Phase 3 , multicenter, randomized withdrawal , double- blind  controlled study in 
subjects with RA on etanercept plus methotrexate who are in very good disease control 
for 6 months prior to study entry.  The study will consist of a 30- day screening period, a 
24-week open -label run- in period, a 48 -week double- blind t reatment per iod and a 30- day 
safety follow -up period.  
The study will enroll approximately 358 subjects.  During the run -in period subjects will 
receive open- label etanercept  and methotrexate at the same dose they were receiving 
during screening.   It is expected that approximately 30% of subjects will early terminate 
the run- in period.  Amgen may choo se to alter the sample size  of subjects enrolled in 
order to ensure that approximately 250 subjects are randomized to treatment.   
Product:  Etanercept 
Protocol Number:  20110186  
Date:  17 October 2017  Page 18 of 74 
CONFIDENTIAL    Approximately 250 subjects will be randomly assigned in a 2:2 :1 ratio to one of three 
treatment groups:  
• Etanercept 50 mg weekly by subcutaneous injection plus oral placebo for 
methotrexate (n = 100) 
• Oral methotrexate 10 to 25 mg weekly plus placebo for etanercept  (n = 100) 
• Etanercept 50 mg weekly by subcutaneous injection plus oral methotrexate 10 to 25 mg weekly (n = 50 ) 
Subjects randomized to the etanercept plus methotrexate group and the methotrexate 
monotherapy group will receive methotrexate at the same dose they were receiving at screening and during the run -in period.  
3.1.1  Rescue Therapy  
After randomi zation, if a subject experiences disease worsening as defined below  
he/she will initiate rescue treatment with etanercept 50 mg once weekly ( QW) plus 
methotrexate (10 to 25 mg ).  Those assigned to the etanercept plus methotrexate arm 
will continue on the assigned treatments.  Subjects will receive methotrexate at the same 
dose that they were receiving at screening.  
Original treatment assignments will remain blinded.  Dispensing of etanercept plus 
methotrexate rescue therapy will be managed via the Interactive Voice and Web 
Response System ( IXRS). 
3.1.2  Disease Worsening  
After randomization, disease worsening for the study is defined as : 
• SDAI  > 3.3 and ≤ 11 on two consecutive visits at least two weeks  apart  OR  
• SDAI > 3.3 and ≤ 11 on three or more  separate visits OR  
• SDAI > 11 at anytime  
Disease worsening may be assessed at a regularly scheduled visit or at a Disease Assessment visit as described in  Section 7.2.7 .  If subject meets the criteria for disease 
worsening then new investigational product will be re -dispensed in a blinded fashion.  
Subjects will remain on study and complete all study visits as per the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1 ). 
The overall study design is described by a study schema at the end of the 
protocol  synopsis section.  The study endpoints are defined in Section 10.1.1 .

CONFIDENTIAL    3.2 Number of Sites  
Approximately 105 sites globally  will participate in the study.  Additional regions and 
sites may be added if necessary .  Sites that do not enroll subjects within 3 months  of site 
initiation may be closed.  
3.3 Number of Subjects  
Participants in this clinical investigation shall be referred to as “ subjects”.  
The number of subjects expected to be enrolled in the study is approximately 358 of 
which approximately 250 will be randomized to the double- blind treatment  period.    
Amgen may choose to alter the sample size of enrolled subjects  to ensure that 
approximately 250 subjects are randomized to the double- blind treatment  period. 
Sample size considerations are provided in Section 10.2. 
3.4 Replacement  of Subjects 
During the double blind- treatment period, subjects who are removed from treatment or 
from the study will not be replaced. 
3.5 Estimated Study Duration 
3.5.1  Study Duration for Subjects 
The study will consist of up to a 30 -day screening, a 24-week open label run-in period, a 
48-week double- blind treatment period, and a 30- day safety follow -up period.  The 
maximal duration of trial participation for an individual subject is approx imately  82 weeks 
including the screening, run- in period, treatment period and safety follow -up.  
3.5.2  End of Study  
Primary Completion:  The primary completion date is defined as the date when the 
last subject is assessed or receives an intervention for the final collection of data 
for the primary endpoint(s), for the purposes of conducting the primary analysis, whether the study concluded as planned in the protocol or was terminated early.  
If the study concludes prior to the primary completion date originally planned in the protocol (ie, early termination of the study), then the primary completion will be the date when the last subject is assessed or receives an intervention for evaluation in the study (ie, last subject last visit).  
End of Study:   The end of study date is defined as the date when the last subject  
across all sites is assessed or receives an intervention for evaluation in the study

5. SUBJECT ENROLLMENT  
Before subjects begin participation in any study -specific activities/procedures, Amgen 
requires a copy of the site’s written institutional review board/ independent ethics 
committee (IRB/IEC ) approval of the protocol, informed consent form, and all other 
subject information and/or recruitment material, if applicable (see Section 11.2).  All 
Product:  Etanercept 
Protocol Number:  20110186  
Date:  17 October 2017  Page 25 of 74 
CONFIDENTIAL    subjects must personally sign and date the informe d consent form before 
commencement of study -specific activit ies/procedures.   
A subject is considered enrolled when the investigator decides that the subject has met 
all Part 1 eligibility criteria.  The i nvestigator is to document this decision and date, in the 
subject’s medical record and register enrollment in the I XRS.  Additionally, i t is the 
responsibility of the investigator to record the current protocol version each subject 
enrolled under.  
Upon completion of run -in period procedures the subject is evaluated by the investigator, 
and if the subject meets all Part 2 eligibility criteria he/she is subsequently randomized to 
a treatment regimen.  Subjects who do not meet Part 2 eligibility criteria will complete an  
early termination run -in visit.  
Each subject who enters into the screening period for the study (defined as the point at 
which the subject signs the informed consent form ) receives a unique subject 
identification number before any study -related activities/procedures are performed.  The 
subject identification number, assigned by I XRS, will be used to identify the subject 
throughout the clinical study and must be used on all study documentation related to that subject.  The subject identification number must remain constant throughout the entire clinical study; it must not be changed after initial assignment, including if a subject is rescreened.  This number will not necessarily be the same as the randomization number assigned for the study.  
Subjects not meeting Part 1 eligibility criteria are permitted to re-screen  up to 
2 additional times after failing the first screening . 
5.1 Randomization /Treatment Assignment  
Subjects who meet P art 2 eligibility criteria will be randomized to receive etanercept plus 
placebo for methotrexate , methotrexate plus placebo for etanercept or etanercept plus 
methotrexate in a 2:2 :1 ratio via I XRS.   
Assignment to the treatment arms will be based on a computer -generated randomization 
schedule prepared by Amgen before the start of the study.  Each randomized subject will receive a single, unique randomization number via I XRS at randomization.   The

CONFIDENTIAL    5.2 Site Personnel Access to Indi vidual Treatment Assignments  
A subject’s treatment assignment should only be unblinded when knowledge of the 
treatment is essential for the further management of the subject  on this study .  In the 
event that a subject’s treatment assignment must be unblinded by the investigator the 
subject will not be allowed to receive any further investigational product.  Refer to the 
Investigational Product Instruction Manual  (IPIM)  for a description regarding how 
responsible pharmacists and investigators will access treatment information via I XRS in 
the event that there is a need to break the treatment blind.  
Unblinding at the study site for any other reason will be considered a protocol deviation.   
The investigator  is strongly encouraged to contact the Amgen Global  Clinical Trial 
Manager  before unblinding any subject’s treatment assignment.  If not possible, the 
investigator must inform the Amgen Global  Clinical Trial Manager within 1 working day 
after the event.

Protocol Number:  20110186  
Date:  17 October 2017  Page 27 of 74 
CONFIDENTIAL    6.2.1.1  Dosage, Administration, and Schedule  
Etanercept dosing in the study will follow the recommended label dosing for subjects 
with RA  (subcutaneous injection, 50 mg once weekly).  Etanercept will be provided as a 
50-mg PFS (0.98 mL of a 50- mg/m L solution of etanercept).  Each dose of 
investigational product will consist of the complete contents of 1 syringe.  The injection 
site should be rotated with each dose.  During the open- label run -in period subjects will 
receive 1 dose of etanercept per w eek (scheduled approximately 7 days apart) for 
24 weeks.  During the double- blind treatment period, subjects will receive 1 dose of 
etanercept or matching placebo per week (scheduled approximately 7 days apart) for 
48 weeks.  Throughout the entire trial, administration of etanercept should occur on the 
scheduled dose day; however, if unavoidable, it may be given earlier or later as long as the dose is not within 2 days of the next scheduled dose.  If the dosing window is 
missed, that dose should be skipped  and the reason for the missed dose must be 
reported on the case report form .  Subsequent doses of investigational product should 
resume on the original schedule, calculated from the run- in visit 1 for the open label 
run-in period of the study and from Day 1 for the double- blind treatment period.  If 
etanercept is to be taken the day of a study visit, it must be taken after the study visit has 
occurred (ie, at the subject’s location on the scheduled dose day).  Injections of 
etanercep t will be administered by the subject or a caregiver.  The individual 
administering the dose must demonstrate to the site staff that he or she is competent to 
correctly administer the subcutaneous doses.  The first dose of etanercept in the open 
label run- in period and Day 1 in the double- blind treatment period must be administered 
at the study site.  All subsequent doses will be administered at the subject’s location on 
the scheduled dose day.  Supplies of etanercept will be dispensed to subjects for 
administration at home.  The site will instruct the subject in appropriate handling and 
storage of used and unused syringes and documentation of dosing in the subject diary.  
The dose date, quantity administered and box number of investigational product are to 
be recorded in each subj ect’s diary/  electronic case report form ( eCRF ).  Please refer to 
the Investigator’s Brochure for the most recent safety information.   A link to the United

open- label methotrexate per week (scheduled approximately 7 days apart) for 24 weeks .  
Subjects will remain on the same dose of methotrexate that they were receiving at screening.   
During the double- blind treatment period, methotrexate will be provided as 
2.5 mg capsules, or as placebo capsules, and will be taken once weekly by oral 
administration.  Subjects will receive 1 dose of methotrexate or placebo per week 
(scheduled approximately 7 days apart) for 48 weeks.  Subjects randomized to etanercept plus methotrexate therapy or methotrexate monotherapy arm will remain on the same dose that they were receiving at screening/run -in. 
Throughout the  entire trial, administration of methotrexate or matching placebo should 
occur on the scheduled dose day; however, if unavoidable, it may be given earlier or later as long as the dose is not within 4 days of the next scheduled dose.  If the dosing window is missed, that dose should be skipped and the next dose should be resumed at the scheduled time.  The reason for the missed  dose must be reported on the case 
report form.  Double or extra doses should not be taken.  The dose  date, quantity 
administered and bottle number  of methotrexate is to be recorded on the subject’s diary

6.9 Contraceptive Requirements  
Female Subjects 
Female subjects of child- bearing potential must agree to practice true sexual abstinence 
(refrain from heterosexual intercourse) or use a highly effective method of contraception 
during treatment and for an additional 6 months after the last dose of protocol required 
therapies.  
Contraceptive methods that achieve a failure rate less of less than 1% per year when used consistently and correctly are considered highly effective and may include:  hormonal (combined estrogen and progestogen or progestogen only), contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation (oral, injectable, implantable, intravaginal, or transdermal route), intrauterine device, intrauterine hormonal -releasing system, bilateral 
tubal occlusion, vasectomized partner (provided that partner is the sole sexual partner of the female participant and the vasectomized partner has received medical assessment 
of the surgical success), true sexual abstinence when this is in line with the preferred 
Product:  Etanercept 
Protocol Number:  20110186  
Date:  17 October 2017  Page 32 of 74 
CONFIDENTIAL    and usual lifestyle of the subject.  The reliability of sexual abstinence must be evaluated 
by the investigator and be the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject.   
If a female subject is suspected of being pregnant, the protocol -required therapies must 
be stopped immediately and may not be resumed until absence of pregnancy has been medically confirmed.   
Females not of child- bearing potential are defined as:  any female who has had a 
hysterectomy, OR bilateral salpingectomy, OR bilateral oophorectomy, OR are 
postmenopausal.  Postmenopausal women are those who have had no spontaneous menses for at least 2 years.  
Male Subjects 
Male subjects who have had a vasectomy and received medical assessment of surgical 
success or whose female partner has had a bilateral tubal occlusion are not required to 
use additional forms of contraception.   
Otherwise, male subjects with a partner of child- bearing potential must agree to practice 
true sexual abstinence (refrain from heterosexual intercourse) or use a condom with spermicide (if spermicide is commercially available) during treatment and for an additional 6 months after the last dose of protocol required therapies.  The reliability of sexual abstinence must be evaluated by the investigator and be the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject.   
The female partner should also consider using an acceptable method of effective 
contraction such as:  hormonal, intrauterine device, intrauterine hormonal -releasing 
system, female barrier method (diaphragm, cervical cap, contraceptive sponge; a female 
condom is not an option because there is a risk of tearing when both partners use a condom).  
Male subjects with a pregnant partner must practice sexual abstinence or wear a condom to prevent exposure of the unborn child to methotrexate through semen.  
Unacceptable methods of birth control for male and female subjects include birth control methods that are considered unacceptable in clinical trials and include:  periodic abstinence (calendar, symptothermal, postovulation methods), withdrawal 
(coitus  interruptus), spermicides only, and lactational amenorrhoea method.

CONFIDENTIAL    7. STUDY PROCEDURES  
Screening assessments and study procedures ou tlined in this section and in Table 1  can 
only be performed after obtaining informed consent.  This includes any discontinuation of 
the subject’s medic ation for the purpose of participation in this study.  
All on -study visits during the run- in period should be scheduled from run- in visit 1.  All 
on-study visits during the treatment period should be scheduled from day 1 (date of the 
first dose of investigational product) on the study.  It is very important to attempt to perform study procedures and obtain samples at the precise timepoints stipulated below.  When it is not possible to perform the study visit at the exact timepoint, the visit may be performed  within the acceptable visit window as defined in the visit -specific section 
below.  
With the exception of the screening and re- screen visits, all study procedures for a visit  
should be completed on the same day.  Any missed visits, tests not done, or 
exami nations that are not conducted must be reported as such on the eCRFs.  
Subsequent study visits should resume on the original schedule.  Missed assessments at prior visits should not be duplicated at subsequent visits.  
Any blood sample collected according to the Schedule of Assessments ( Table  1) may be 
analyzed for any of the tests outlined in the protocol and for any tests necessary to ensure subject safety.  This includes testing to ensure analytical methods produce reliable and valid data throughout the course of the study.  This may also include, but is 
not limited to, investigation of unexpected results, incurred sample reanalysis, and 
analysis for m ethod transfer and comparability.  Refer to the applicable supplemental 
laboratory manuals for detailed collection and handling procedures.

CONFIDENTIAL    7.2 General  Study Procedures 
The procedures performed at each study visit are outlined in Table 1 .  Details regarding 
each type of procedure are provided in subs equent sub -sections.   
Refer to the applicable supplemental central laboratory, I XRS, IPIM, and study manuals 
for detailed collection and handling procedures.  
7.2.1  Screening  
Informed consent must be obtained before completing any other screening procedure.  
After written informed consent is signed by the subject, the subject will be screened in 
order to assess eligibility for study participation.  The screening window is 30 days.  If a 
subject has not met all Part 1 eligibility criteria at the end of the 30 -day window, the 
subject will be registered as a screen fail.  At screening, if the subject is positive for 
hepatitis B core antibody, the confirmatory reflex testing will be performed using hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR).   Subjects  who screen fail may be 
eligible to rescreen two additional times  per Section 7.2.2 . 
7.2.2  Re-screening  
Subjects who are unable to complete or meet Part 1 eligibility criteria on initial screening will be permitted to re- screen  two additional times after the first screening visit failure.  
Re-screen subjects must first be registered as screen failed in I XRS and subsequently 
registered as a re- screen subject  with the same subject identification number .  Once the 
subject is registered as re- screened, a new 30- day screening window will begin.  
If the re -screening period begins more than 30 days after the original signing of the 
informed consent form, all screening procedures, including informed consent must be repeated.  If the re- screening occurs within  30 days after the original signing of the 
informed consent, only those criteria that were originally not met would be required to be 
repeated.  Tuberculosis testing will not need to be repeated for re -screen subjects if 
negative at the original screening.  Subjects who fail screening  for not meeting inc lusion 
criterion  114 are not permitted to re- screen.   Subjects screen failing for not meeting 
inclusion criteria 106 are permitted to re- screen 1 additional time if their initial SDAI 
screening score is <  6.0.  If a subject does not meet  inclusion criteria 106 after 
2 screening attempts no additional rescreening is permitted.  Rescreening for failure to 
meet inclusion criteria 106 must occur at least 2 weeks after the initial screening.

CONFIDENTIAL    7.2.3  Open Label Run -in Period 
Once a subject has met the Part 1 eligibility criteria evaluated during screening, the 
subject will enter the 24- week open- label run -in period.  During the run- in period, 
Part 2 eligibility criteria will be evaluated  at the regular ly scheduled run-in visits or at a 
Disease Assessme nt visit (see Section 7.2.7 ) if required.  If the subject does not meet 
the Part 2 eligibility criteria they must complete a run-in early termination visit.  
Subjec ts will initiate treatment with open- label etanercept and methotrexate at the same 
dose they were receiving at screening.  Investigational products, subject diaries, and 
related supplies will be dispensed to the subject at every regularly scheduled visit f or 
self-administration.  
All procedures during run- in visit 3 (see Table 1 ) must be completed within 7 days of the 
baseline (day 1)  visit in order to confirm the subject’s eligibility . 
7.2.4  Early Termination Run-in 
Subjects not meeting Part 2 el igibility criteria will complete a run-in early termination visit 
and will complete the procedures described in  Table  1.  
7.2.5  Baseline Visit (Day 1)  
Subjects meeting Part 1 and Part 2 eligibility criteria will be randomized  by IXRS as 
described in Section 5.  The date of first dose of blinded investigational product is 
defined as Day 1 Week 0.  All subsequent doses and study visits will be scheduled based on the Day 1 date.  Following the first blinded dose, investigational products and related supplies will be dispensed to the subject for 12 weeks of self -administration . 
7.2.6  Treatment  
Visits will occur per the S chedule of A ssessments ( Table  1) during the treatment period 
from day 1 until week 48 .  On -study visits may be completed within ± 7 days of the target 
visit date.   The procedures completed during the 48- week treatment period are those 
listed in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1 ).  Administration of investigational 
product is to be administered after all other study procedures, as applicable, during each visit that is required.  
7.2.7  Disease Assessment Visit  
Subjects can be seen at a regularly scheduled visit or at a disease assessment visit any time after screening to assess disease activity to either:  
• establish P art 2 eligibility  criteria during the run -in period OR  
• to determine if subject can receive rescue treatment after randomization

Protocol Number:  20110186  
Date:  17 October 2017  Page 38 of 74 
CONFIDENTIAL    During the double- blind randomized treatment period, if the subject meets the criteria for 
disease worsening as defined in Section 3.1.2  subjects will initiate treatment with 
etanercept and methotrexate at the same dose they were receiving during the run- in 
period.  Subjects will continue to receive etanercept plus methotrexate for the remaining 
study visits per  Table 1 .  
7.2.8  Subject End of Treatment/Early Termination  
Subjects will complete an e nd of treatment (EOT) visit at week 48 within a window of 
± 7 days of the target visit date (see Table  1).  Subjects ending the study prior to 
week  48 will be asked to complete an Early Termination visit.  
7.2.9  Safety Follow -up/End of Study  
Approximately 30 days, within a window of + 7 days of the target visit date, after the last dose of investigational products, subjects will be contacted by phone by the site staff to collect any serious adverse events (refer to  Section 9).  
7.3 Descripti on of Study Assessments and Procedures 
Assessment and procedures are further detailed in this section.  See Table 1  for 
required timepoints.  
7.3.1  Informed Consent  
All subjects or their legally authorized representative must sign and personally date the IEC/IRB approved informed consent before any study -specific  procedures are 
performed.  See Section 11.1 for further details.  
7.3.2  D emographic D ata 
Demographic data collection including sex, age, race, and ethnicity will be collected in order to study their possible association with subject safety and treatment effectiveness.  
Additionally demographic data will be used to study the impact on biomarker variability of the protocol required therapies.  
7.3.3  Medical History  
The subject ’s relevant medical and surgical history that started within 5 years or as 
necessary for chronic co -morbid conditions prior to enrollment through the start of the 
adverse event reporting period will be collected.  Medical history will include information 
on the subject’s concurrent medical conditions.  Record all findings on the medical 
history eCRF.  In addition to the medical history above, RA history should date back to 
the original diagnosis.  
Product:  Etanercept 
Protocol Number:  20110186  
Date:  17 October 2017  Page 39 of 74 
CONFIDENTIAL    7.3.4  Medica tion History 
The subject’s complete history of RA medications  will be recorded on the eCRF.  Th is 
information will include the subject’s DMARDs , NSAIDS,  corticosteroid, biologics , and 
investigational medication history.   All other medications taken within 6 months prior to 
screening will be recorded on the eCRF.  For RA medications, the following information 
will be recorded in the eCRF:  medication name, indication, dose, unit, route, frequency, 
and start and stop dates.  For all other medications, only the medication name, 
indication, and start and stop dates will be recorded in the eCRF.  
7.3.5  Physical Examination  
The screening physical examination is per standard of care.  Physical examination 
findings at screening should be recorded on the appropriate eCRF (eg, medical history ).  
The physical examination at subsequent study visits will consist of an interim examination to monitor for any changes from the screening physical examination.  Any clinically significant changes in physical examination per the Principal Investigator’s opinion should be recorded on the adverse events eCRF.   
7.3.6  Physical Measurement  
Height in inches /centimeters  and weight in pounds /kilograms  should be measured 
without shoes . 
7.3.7  Vital Signs  
The following measurements must be performed:  systolic and diastolic blood pressure, 
heart rate, respirat ory rate, and temperature.  Subject must be in a supine position in a 
rested and calm state for at least 5 minutes before blood pressure assessments are conducted.  If the subject is unable to be in the supine position, the subject should be in 
the most recumbent position as possible.  The position selected for a subject should be 
the same that is used throughout the study and documented on the vital sign eCRF.  
The body region used to assess temperature for a subject should remain consi stent 
throughout the study and documented on the vital signs e CRF.  If abnormalities are 
found and they are considered an adverse event, record on the adverse event summar y 
page.  
7.3.8  Rheumatoid Arthritis Disease Assessments 
7.3.8.1  Swollen/Tender Joint Counts 
All join t assessments will be performed by an experienced trained joint assessor who 
has been certified as trained by Amgen and must be identified on the delegation of 
authority for this responsibility .  Each subject should have their joint assessments done 
Product:  Etanercept 
Protocol Number:  20110186  
Date:  17 October 2017  Page 40 of 74 
CONFIDENTIAL    by the same assessor throughout the study  when possible and the user identification of 
the joint assessor is captured in the electronic PRO (ePRO) tablet.  If necessary, study 
visits may be rescheduled within the specified window of ± 7 days to accommodate 
when the specific assessor will be available.  The score for each joint will be recorded 
directly into the ePRO tablet which will serve as the source documentation and will not 
be transposed to the eCRF.  
Joints that have been replaced are considered inevaluable.  For the screening and 
baseline joint assessments, distal interphalangeal joints should be evaluated, but should 
not be included in the total count to determine eligibility.  
Swollen Joint Count Assessments – A total of 66 joints will be scored for presence or  
absence of swelling.  
Tender Joint Count Assessments – A total of 68 joints will be scored for presence or  
absence of tenderness.  
7.3.8.2  Physician Global Assessment of Disease A ctivity  
The global assessment of the subject’s arthritis will be assessed by eith er the joint 
assessor or the principal investigator ( PI) for the study  by completion of a visual analog 
scale (VAS) .  The VAS is 100 m m in length with “0” and “No Activity at All” on the left 
end of the line and “100” and “Worst Activity Imaginable” at the right end of the line.  The 
subject and joint assessor or the PI for the study  must complete the global assessments 
independently from each other.   
7.3.8.3  Simplified Disease Activity  Index (SDAI)  
The SDAI is the numerical sum of five outcome parameters:   tender joint count and 
swollen joint count based on a 28‐ joint assessment, patient global assessment of 
disease activity, physician global assessment of disease activity  and C ‐reactive protein 
(CRP in mg/d L).  SDAI is calcu lated by the sponsor.  
7.3.9  Patient Reported Outcomes  
PRO  assessments should be completed first (before other study procedures and 
administration of study medication) at each visit where they are required.  
7.3.9.1  Patient Global Assessment of Joint Pain  
The severity of  the subject’s joint pain will be assessed by completion of a VAS.  The 
horizontal line is 100 m m in length with “0” and “no pain at all ” on the left end of the line 
and “100” and “worst pain imaginable” on the right end of the line.  This questionnaire 
should take approximately 1 minute to complete.

CONFIDENTIAL    7.3.9.2  Patient Global Assessment of Disease Activity 
The subject’s global assessment of their arthritis disease activity will be assessed by 
completion of a VAS.  The horizontal line is 100 m m in length with “0” and  “No RA 
Activity At All” on the left end of the line and “100” and “Worst RA Activity Imaginable” on 
the right end of the line.  The subject and health care provider must complete the global 
assessments independently from each other.  This questionnaire should take 
approximately 1 minute to complete.  
7.3.9.3  Disability Index of the Health Assessment Questionnaire  
The Disability Index of the Health Assessment Questionnaire ( HAQ -DI) will be utilized to 
assess the subject’s physical function or disability according to  the subject.  The HAQ -DI 
asks about the degree of difficulty a person has in accomplishing tasks in 8 functional areas (dressing, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reaching, gripping, and errands and chores).  Responses in each functional area are  scored from 0 indicating no difficulty to 
3 indicating inability to perform a task in that area.  The study staff should not clarify any 
of the questions for the subject.  This questionnaire should take approximately 5 minutes 
to complete.  
7.3.9.4  Medical Outcomes Short  Form -36 Questionnaire (SF -36) 
The Medical Outcomes Short Form -36 Questionnaire ( SF-36) is a 36 -item instrument 
that measures general health status.  It includes 8 multi -item scales, each of which 
assess 1 of the f ollowing 8 health concepts:   1) limitation s in physical activities because 
of health problems; 2) limitations in social activities because of physical or emotional problems; 3) limitations in usual role activities because of physical health problems; 4) bodily pain; 5) general mental health (psychologic al distress and well -being); 
6) limitations in usual role activities because of emotional problems; 7) vitality (energy 
and fatigue); and 8) general health perceptions.  The SF -36 assesses the subject’s 
perception of health status over the previous month and takes about 15 minutes to complete . 
7.4 Laboratory Assessments 
All screening and on -study laboratory samples will be processed and sent to the central 
laboratory with the exception of erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), urine pregnancy, 
PPD, and Quantiferon (may be done by central or local laboratory).  The central 
laboratory will be responsible for all screening and on- study serum chemistry, 
hematology, serum pregnancy, urinalysis , high sensitivity C RP, and any other laboratory 
tests required.  ESR, urine pregnancy and PPD testing, if applicable, will be performed

CONFIDENTIAL    locally with kits provided by the central laboratory (except PPD).  The results of this 
testing will be maintained in the source documents at the site.   Amgen o r designee will 
be responsible for biomarker development and pharmacogenetic assessments, and the 
central laboratory will ship the samples to Amgen or a specialty laboratory for assay (depending on the assessment).  The central laboratory will provide a study manual that 
outlines handling, labeling, and shipping procedures for all samples.  All blood samples 
will be obtained by venipuncture before investigational product administration.  The date 
and time of sample collection will be recorded in the source documents at the site.

CONFIDENTIAL    7.4.1  Tuberculosis Testing  
National guidelines should be followed for appropriate tuberculosis screening in the 
setting of anti -TNF therapy.  
All subjects must receive either a PPD or Quantiferon test  at screening per 
Section 4.1.1 .  PPD testing should be performed unless contraindicated.  
7.4.1.1  PPD 
The PPD test must be read by a trained healthcare professional 48 to 72 hours after the 
test is placed.   PPD reader must be identified on the delegation of authority for this 
responsibility . 
7.4.1.2  Quantiferon  
If a subject does not receive a PPD test, then a Quantiferon test must be per formed per 
Section 4.1.1 .  Please refer to the central laboratory manual for instructions on sample 
collection, processing, and shipping of samples (if applicable). 
7.4.2  Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate  
ESR will be performed locally at each site and the  ESR data will be submitted to the 
central laboratory per the instructions in the study manual provided by the central 
laboratory.  The central laboratory will provide all supplies.  The screening and baseline ESR may be performed by any trained staff at the site.  Once the subject has been randomized, the ESR may only be performed by a trained individual at the site who does not perform any study assessments with subjects on the study.  Staff performing the ESR must be  identified on the delegation of authority for this responsibility .  The results 
of the ESR performed after the subject has been randomized must be maintained in a blinded fashion so that it may not be viewed by staff who perform any study assessments with  the subjects.  
7.4.3  Urine Pregnancy Test  
Urine pregnancy tests will be performed locally at each site.  The central laboratory will provide the urine pregnancy tests on visits where required.  Urine pregnancy tests must 
be given prior to dispensing investigatio nal product.  If a urine pregnancy test is positive, 
investigational product must be held; if pregnancy is confirmed, then investigational product must be discontinued.  
7.5 Biomarker Development  
Biomarkers are objectively measured and evaluated indicators of normal biologic processes, pathogenic processes, or pharmacologic responses to a therapeutic 
Product:  Etanercept 
Protocol Number:  20110186  
Date:  17 October 2017  Page 44 of 74 
CONFIDENTIAL    intervention.  Biomarker development can be useful in developing markers to identify 
disease subtypes, guide therapy, and/or predict disease severity.  
Amgen may att empt to develop test(s) designed to identify subjects most likely to 
respond positively or negatively to etanercept and/or methotrexate.  
7.6 Pharmacogenetic Studies 
If the subject consents to the optional pharmacogenetic portion of this study, DNA 
analyses may be performed.  These optional pharmacogenetic analyses focus on 
inherited genetic variations to evaluate their possible correlation to the disease and/or responsiveness to the therapies used in this s tudy.  The goals of the optional studies 
include the use of genetic markers to help in the investigation of RA  and/or to identify 
subjects who may have positive or negative response to Amgen and non-A mgen 
investigational product .  No additional samples are collected for this part of the study .  
For subjects who consent to this/these analysis/analyses , DNA may be extracted.  
7.7 Sample Storage and Destruction  
Any blood sample collected according to the Schedule of Assessments ( Table  1) can be 
analyzed for any of the tests out lined in the protocol and for any tests necessary to 
minimize risks to study subjects.  This includes testing to ensure analytical methods 
produce reliable and valid data  throughout the course of the study .  This can also 
include, but is not limited to, investigation of unexpected results, incurred sample reanalysis, and analyses for method transfer and comparability.  
All samples and associated results will be coded prior to being shipped from the site for analysis or storage.  Samples will be tracked using a unique identifier that is assigned to the samples for the study.  Results are stored in a secure database to ens ure 
confidentiality.    
If informed consent is provided by the subject, Amgen can  do additional testing on 
remaining samples (ie, residual and back -up) to investigate and better understand 
inflammatory conditions , the dose response and/or prediction of response to etanercept 
or methotrexate, and characterize aspects of the molecule (eg, mechanism of 
action/target, metabolites).  Results from this analysis are to be documented and maintained, but are not necessarily reported as part of this study.  Samples can be retained for up to 20 years.  
Since the evaluations are not expected to benefit the subject directly or to alter the treatment course, the results of pharmacogenetic , biomarker development , or other 
Product:  Etanercept 
Protocol Number:  20110186  
Date:  17 October 2017  Page 45 of 74 
CONFIDENTIAL    exploratory studies  are not placed in the subject’s m edical record and are not to be 
made available to the subject, members of the family, the personal physician, or other 
third parties , except as specified in the informed consent.  
The subject retains the right to request that the sample material be destroyed by contacting the investigator .  Following the request from the subject, the i nvestigator is to 
provide the sponsor with the required study and subject number so that any remaining blood samples and any other components from the cells can be located and destroyed.   
Samples will be destroyed once all protocol -defined procedures are completed.   
However, information collected from samples prior to the request for destruction, will be retained by Amgen.  
The sponsor is the exclusive owner of any data, discoveries, or derivative materials from 
the sample materials and is responsible for the destruction of the sample(s) at the request of the subject through the i nvestigator , at the end o f the storage period , or as 
appropriate (eg, the scientific rationale for experimentation with a certain sample type no 
longer justifies keeping the sample).  If a commercial product is developed from this 
research project, the sponsor owns the commercial product.  The subject has no 
commercial rights to such product and has no commercial rights to the data, information, 
discoveries, or derivative materials gained or produced from the sample.  See Section 11.3 for subject confidentiality.  
8. WITHDRAWAL FROM TREATMENT, PROCEDURES, AND STUDY  
8.1 Subject s’ Decision to Withdraw  
Subjects have the right to withdraw from the study at any time and for any reason without prejudice to their  future medical care by the physician or at the institution.  
Subjects can decline to continue receiving investigational product and/or other 
protocol -required therapies or procedures at any time during the study  but continue 
participation in the study .  If this occurs, the investigator is to discuss with the subject the 
appropriate processes for discontinuation from investigational product or other 
protocol -required therapies and must discuss with the subject t he options for 
continuation of the Schedule of Assessments  (Table  1) and collection of data, including 
endpoints and adverse events .  The investigator  must document the change to the 
Schedule of A ssessments  (Table 1 ) and the level of follow -up that is agreed to by the 
subject ( eg, in person, by tele phone/mail, through family/friends, in 
correspondence/communication with other physicians, from review of the medical records ). 
Product:  Etanercept 
Protocol Number:  20110186  
Date:  17 October 2017  Page 46 of 74 
CONFIDENTIAL    Withdrawal of consent for a study means that the subject does not wish to receive 
further protocol -required therapies or procedures , and the  subject does not wish to or is 
unable to continue further study participation .  Subject data up to withdrawal of consent 
will be included in the analysis of the study , and where permitted, publically available 
data can be included after withdrawal of cons ent.  The investigator is to discuss with the 
subject appropriate procedures for withdrawal from the study.  The data generated may 
potentially  not be included in the subject’s study data, except in the case of a possibly 
related serious adverse event, where data will be collected.   
8.2 Investigator or Sponsor Decision to Withdraw  or Terminate 
Subjects’ Participation Prior to Study Completion  
The investigator and /or sponsor can decide to withdraw a subject(s) from investigational 
product and/or other protocol- required therapies, protocol procedures , or the study as a 
whole at any time prior to study completion.  
Subjects may be eligible for continued treatment with Amgen investigational product (s) 
and/or other protocol -required therapies by a separate protocol or as provided for by the 
local country’s regulatory mechanism, based on parameters consistent with Section 12.1. 
8.3 Reasons for Removal From Run-in, Treatment , or Study

9. SAFETY DATA COLLECTION, RECORDING, AND REPORTING  
9.1 Definition  of Safety Events  
9.1.1  Adverse Events  
An adverse event is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical trial 
subject.  The event does not necessarily have a causal relationship with study treatment.  The investigator is responsible for ensuring that any adverse events observed by the 
investigator or reported by the subject are recorded in the subject’s medical record.   
The definition of adverse events includes  worsening of a pre -existing medical condition.  
Worsening indicates that the pre -existing medical condition or underlying disease 
(eg, diabetes, migraine headaches, gout) has increased in severity, frequency, and/or 
duration more than would be expected, and/or has an association with a significantly 
worse outcome  than expected.  A pre -existing condition that has not worsened more 
than anticipated (ie, more than usual fluctuation of disease)  during the study or involves 
an intervention such as elective cosmetic surgery or a medical procedure while on- study , 
is no t considered an adverse event.  
Product:  Etanercept 
Protocol Number:  20110186  
Date:  17 October 2017  Page 48 of 74 
CONFIDENTIAL    An adverse device effect is any adverse event related to the use of a medical device.  
Adverse device effects include adverse events resulting from insufficient or inadequate 
instructions for use, adverse events resulting from any malfunction of the device, or adverse events resulting from use error or from intentional misuse of the device.  
The investigator’s clinical judgment is used to determine whether a subject is to be 
removed from treatment due to an adverse event.  In the event a subject, or subject’s 
legally acceptable representative request s to withdraw from protocol- required therapies  
or the study due to an adverse event , refer to  Section 8.1 for additional instructions on 
the procedures recommended for safe withdrawal from protocol -required therapies or 
the study.  
9.1.2  Serious Adverse Events 
A serious adverse event is defined as an adverse event that meets at least 1 of the following serious criteria:  
• fatal 
• life threatening (places the subject at immediate risk of death) 
• requires in -patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization 
• results in persistent or significant  disability/incapacity  
• congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• other medically important serious event  
An adverse event would meet the criterion of “requires hospitalization”, if the event necessitated an admission to a health care facility (eg, overnight stay).  
If an i nvestigator considers an event to be clinically important, but it does not meet any 
of the serious criteria, the event could be classified as a serious adverse event under the criterion of “other medically important serious event”.  Examples of such events could include allergic bronchospasm, convulsions, blood dyscrasias, drug -induced liver injury 
(DILI) (see Appendix  A for drug -induced liver injury reporting criteria), or events that 
necessitate an emergency room visit, outpatient surgery, or urgent intervention.  
9.2 Safety Event Reporting Procedures  
9.2.1  Adverse Events  
9.2.1.1  Reporting Procedures for Adverse Events That do not Meet Serious 
Criteria  
The inves tigator  is responsible for ensuring that all adverse events observed by the 
investigator  or reported by the subject that occur after enrollment  through the end of 
treatment period are reported using the Event CRF. 
Product:  Etanercept 
Protocol Number:  20110186  
Date:  17 October 2017  Page 49 of 74 
CONFIDENTIAL    The investigator must assign the following  adverse event attributes:  
• Adverse event diagnosis or syndrome(s), if known (if not known, signs or symptoms),  
• Dates of onset and resolution (if resolved) , 
• Severity (and/or toxicity per protocol), 
• Assessment of relatedness to investigational product (s), and 
• Action taken.  
The adverse event grading scale used will be the Common Toxicity Criteria Version 4.0.  
The grading scale used in this study is described in Appendix  A.  The investigator must 
assess whether the adverse event is possibly related to the investigational product (s).  
This relationship is indicated by a “yes” or “no” response to the question:  Is there a 
reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by the investigational product (s)? 
The investigator is responsible for reviewing laboratory test results and determining 
whether an abnormal value in an individual study subject represents a clinically 
significant change from the subject’s baseline values.  In general, abnormal laboratory 
findings without c linical significance (based on the investigator's judgment) are not to be 
recorded as adverse events.  However, laboratory value changes that require treatment or adjustment in current therapy are considered adverse events.  Where applicable, clinical sequ elae (not the laboratory abnormality) are to be recorded as the adverse 
event.  
The Investigator is expected to follow reported a dverse events until stabilization or 
reversibility.  
If the severity of an adverse event changes from the date of onset to the date of 
resolution, record as a single event with the worst severity on the Adverse Event 
Summary CRF. 
9.2.2  Reporting Procedures for Serious Adverse Events  
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all serious adverse events observed by 
the investigator or reported by the subject that occur after signing of the informed 
consent through 30 days after the last day of the dos ing interval of investigational 
product (s) are re corded in the subject’s medical record and are submitted to Amgen.   All 
serious adverse events must be submitted to Amgen within 24 hours following the 
investigator’s knowledge of the event via the Event CRF.  
Product:  Etanercept 
Protocol Number:  20110186  
Date:  17 October 2017  Page 50 of 74 
CONFIDENTIAL    After the protocol -required reporting period defined above, the investigator does not 
need to actively monitor subjects for serious adverse events.  However, if the 
investigator becomes aware of a serious adverse event after this protocol -required 
reporting period, the investigator will report the event to Amgen within 24 hours following 
the investigator’s knowledge of  the event.  Serious a dverse events reported outside of 
the protocol -required reporting period will be captured within the safety database as 
clinical trial cases for the purposes of expedited reporting.  
If the electronic data capture (EDC) system is unavailable to the site staff to report the 
serious adverse event , the information is to be reported to Amgen via an eSAE 
Contingency Report Form within 24 hours of the investigator’s knowledge of the event.  
See Appendix  B for a sample of the S erious Adverse Event W orksheet /eSAE 
Contingency Report Form .  For EDC studies  where the first notification of a Serious 
Adverse Event  is reported to Amgen v ia the eSerious Adverse Event Contingency 
Report Form, the data must be entered into the EDC system when the system is again 
available.  
The investigator must assess whether the serious adverse event is possibly related to 
any study -mandated activity or procedure.  This relationship is indicated by a “yes” or 
“no” response to the question:  “Is there a reasonable possibility that the event may have 
been caused by a study activity/procedure”?  
The investigator is expected to follow reported serious adverse events until stabilization 
or reversibility.  
New information relating to a previously reported serious adverse event must be 
submitted to Amgen.   All new information for serious adverse events must be sent to 
Amgen within 24 hours following knowledge of the new information.  If specifically 
requested, t he investigator  may be asked to provide additional follow -up information, 
such as  discharge summar ies, medical records,  or extracts from the medical record.  
Information provided about the serious adverse event must be consistent with that recorded on the Event  CRF.  
If a subject is permanently withdrawn from protocol -required therapies because of a 
serious adverse event, this information must be submitted to Amgen.

CONFIDENTIAL    10.1.2  Analysis Sets  
10.1.2.1  Primary Analysis Set  
The primary analysis set will include all randomized subjects.  The analysis will be 
conducted according to the original randomization regardless of the actual treatment 
received during the study (as per intent -to-treat principle).  All the primary, secondary , 
and exploratory efficacy endpoints will be evaluated on the primary analysis set . 
10.1.2.2  Safety Analysis Set  
This subset will include all randomized subjects who received at least one dose of any investigational product during the study.   For all safety endpoints, subjects will be 
analyzed based on the actual treatment received.  
10.1.3  Covariates and Subgroups 
The following baseline covariates will be considered to assess their influence on the 
primary and secondary endpoints:  
• age (years)  (continuous)  
• sex (male/female)  
• race  
• ethni city (Hispanic or Latino vs Non- Hispanic or Latino)  
• disease duration (years)  
• baseline methotrexate dose 
• other covariates may be evaluated as necessary  
Subgroup analyses, which would be considered exploratory, may be performed if an 
examination of the above covariates suggests that any treatment difference for the 
primary and secondary endpoints  depends on any baseline covariates.  
10.2 Sample Size Considerations  
The sample size was determined from a hypothesis of superiority of etanercept monotherapy over methotrexate monotherapy.  The proportion of subjects achieving 
SDAI remission after 52 weeks of double- blind treatment in the PRESERVE and 
COMET studies  was used to estimate the treatment effects.  PRESERVE was a 
two-period study conducted in subjects with RA who had moderate disease activity 
despite a stable dose of oral methotrexate for a minimum of 8 weeks at the time of 
screening.   Among all su bjects who were in SDAI remission at both week 28 and 
week  36 (the last two visits of the open -label  run-in period) , the proportion of subjects 
who were still in remission after the 52- week double- blind period was 86.1% and 38.1% 
Product:  Etanercept 
Protocol Number:  20110186  
Date:  17 October 2017  Page 54 of 74 
CONFIDENTIAL    for the etanercept plus methotrexate therapy  and methotrexate monotherapy treatment 
groups , respectively .  COMET was a two -period study conducted in subjects with active 
early RA.  Among all subjects who received etanercept plus methotrexate therapy in 
Period 1 and were in SDAI remission at week 52, the last visit of Period 1, the proportion of subjects who were in still in remission after the 52 -week double- blind Period 2 was 
78.3% and 72.4%, respectively, for the etanercept plus methotrexate therapy and etanercept monotherapy treatment groups.  Given key differences noted in this study, 
including the sustained period of remission prior to withdrawal , the response rate in the 
methotrexate monotherapy arm is approximated to be higher at 50%, with the response 
rate in the etanercept monotherapy arm at approximately  72%.  It is expected that 
compared to PRESERVE, subjects in the current study will have more stable disease at the time of randomization.  Namely, s ubjects must be in very good disease control for 
6 months  prior to study entry and must be in SDAI remission at the end of a 24- week 
open- label run- in period.  
The sample size is based on the adequacy to evaluate the efficacy of etanercept monotherapy compared to methotrexate monotherapy as measured by the prima ry 
endpoint of SDAI remission at week 48 at a significance level of 0.05.  Based on a 
two-sided chi -square test with 90% power, 10 0 subjects per arm are required at 
randomization.  
Using an assumed attrition rate of 3 0% in the open- label run- in period, due to exclusion 
of subjects with disease worsening during the run -in period, or other reasons , 
approximately 358 subjects will b e enrolled in order to have approximately 250 subjects 
randomized in a 2:2:1 ratio to one of three treatment groups:  etanercept monotherapy 
(n = 100), methotrexate monotherapy (n =  100), and etanercept plus methotrexate 
combination therapy (n  = 50).  Amgen may choose to alter the sample size of subjects 
enrolled in order to ensure that approximately 250 subjects are randomized to t reatment.  
10.3 Access to Individual Subject Treatment Assignments by Amgen or 
Designees 
Blinded individuals will not have access to unblinded information until the study is 
formally unblinded.  Unblinding and potentially unblinding information should not  be 
distributed to the study team, investigators , or subjects prior to the study being formally 
unblinded (eg, the formal unblinding may occur at the final analysis rather than during 
the primary analysis) except as specified (eg, Sect ion 5.2 and Section 9.2.2 , and 
Statistical Analysis Plan  [SAP] ).

CONFIDENTIAL    10.4 Planned Analyses  
10.4.1  Primary analysis  
Primary a nalysis activities are commenced based on achieving the End of Study  
milestone described in Section 3.5.2 . 
10.4.2  Interim Analyses  
No interim analysis is planned for this study.  
10.5 Planned Methods of Analysis  
10.5.1  General Considerations 
Baseline demographics and disease characteristics will be summarized descriptively.  
Summary descriptive statistics by each treatment group will be provided.  For categorical 
endpoints, the descriptive statistics will contain the frequency and percentage.   For 
continuous endpoints, the descriptive statistics will include the number of observations, 
mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, maximum  and 95% confidence interval. 
Non-responder imputation will be employed for the missing values of the primary 
endpoint.  Secondary efficacy endpoints will be summarized using observed cases only.  
As supportive analysis, the primary endpoint will also be summarized using observed cases . 
The statistical test for the primary efficacy endpoint  will be two -sided with a significance 
level of 0.05.  
10.5.2  Primary Efficacy Endpoint  
The primary analysis for the p rimary endpoint for this study , SDAI remission at week 48 , 
will be performed using the primary analysis set.  The primary endpoint will be  measured 
by the proportion of subjects who maintain SDAI remission (SDAI ≤ 3.3) at week 48.  
SDAI remission at week 48 for the e tanercept monotherapy treatment arm will be 
compared to the methotrexate monotherapy  arm using the chi -square test.    
Both subjects who drop out and subjects receiving  rescue therapy  due to disease 
worsening during the double- blind period will be considered non -responders.  
Furthermore, the randomized subjects who did not receive any dose of any of the 
investigational products will be considered non- responders in the primary analysis.  
As a sensitivity analysis, subjects who receive rescue t herapy or that drop out will have 
their post -rescue SDAI responses set to  missing and a multiple imputation technique to 
impute these values will be employed.   The multiple imputation method is less 
Product:  Etanercept 
Protocol Number:  20110186  
Date:  17 October 2017  Page 56 of 74 
CONFIDENTIAL    conservative than the non-responder imputation method and will be prospectively 
described in more detail in the SAP.  
A subject’s SDAI score is calculated as follows:  
SDAI = 28 -joint tender joint count + 28 -joint swollen joint count + P atient Global 
Assessment of Disease Activity  + Physician Global Assessment of Disease Activity  
+ C-reactive protein (mg/dL) . 
10.5.3  Secondary Efficacy  Endpoints  
• Simplified Disease Activity Index remission (≤ 3.3) at week 48 for the etanercept 
plus methotrexate treatment arm will be compared to the methotrexate 
monotherapy arm using the chi- square test and will be presented with nominal 
p-values only (eg, no adjustment for multiplicity will be done).  
• The proportion of subjects achieving SDAI remission , SDAI continuous score and 
SDAI change from baseline at all study timepoints will be summarized by 
treatment group.  DAS28 -ESR, DAS28 -CRP  and CDAI and their changes from 
baseline will be also summarized at all study timepoints by treatment group.  
Proportion of subjects achieving Boolean remission will be tabulated at all study timepoints by treatment group.   Proportion of subjects with disease worsening 
(defined as an SDAI > 3.3 and ≤ 11 during tw o consecutive visits at least 
2-weeks apart or SDAI > 3.3 and ≤ 11 on three or more separate visits or 
SDAI > 11 after randomization) as well as  time to disease worsening will be 
evaluated.  
• In subjects that receive rescue treatment during the double- blind treatment 
period time to recaptur e of SDAI  remission after starting rescue treatment will be 
analy zed.  Additionally, the proportion of subjects  who recapture SDAI remission 
at week 48 will be summarized.  
10.5.4  Exploratory  Endpoints 
Exploratory endpoints will also be summarized by treatment group at all timepoints.  
Exploratory endpoints include 28- swollen joint count , 28-tender joint count , Physician 
Global Assessment  of Disease Activity  (0-10 VAS) , Patient Global Assessment of 
Disease Activity (0 -10 VAS) , HAQ -DI and SF-36.  
10.5.5  Safety Endpoints 
Safety analyses will be based on the safety analysis set.  Subject incidence of all treatment -emergent adverse events will be tabulated by system organ class and 
preferred term.  Tables of fatal adverse events, serious adverse events, adverse events leading to withdrawal from investigational product or other protocol -required therapies, 
and significant trea tment -emergent adverse events will also be provided.  
Laboratory parameters with grade 3 or above will be summarized by study visit and treatment group.  Vital signs will be reported in baseline summaries.  Shift tables of the

• Updates to CRFs will be automatically documented through the software’s “audit trail”.  
• To ensure the quality of clinical data across all subjects and sites, a clinical data 
management review is performed on subject data received at Amgen.  During this review, subject data are checked for consistency, omissions, and any apparent 
discrepancies.  In addition, the data are reviewed for adherence to the protocol and 
GCP.  To resolve any questions arising from the clinical data management review process, data queries and/or site notifications are created in the EDC system 
database for site resolution and subsequently closed by the EDC system or by an 
Amgen reviewer.  
• The investigator  signs only the Investigator  Verification Form for this EDC study.  
This signature indicates that investigator inspected or reviewed the data on the CRF, 
the data queries, and the site notifications, and agrees with the content.  
Amgen (or designee) will perform self -evident corrections to obvious data errors in the 
clinical trial database, as documented in the Study Specific Self -Evident Corrections 
Plan.  Examples of obvious  data errors that may be corrected by Amgen (or designee) 
include deletion of obvious duplicate data (eg, same results sent twice with the same 
date with different visit -week 4 and early termination) and clarifying “other, specify” if 
data are provided (eg, race, physical examination).  Each investigative site will be 
provided a list of the types of corrections applied to study data at the initiation of the trial and at study closeout.   
12.4 Investigator  Responsibilities for Data Collection 
The investigator  is responsible for comply ing with the requirements for all assessments 
and data collection (including subjects not receiving protocol -required therapies) as 
stipulated in the protocol for each subject in the study.  For subjects who withdraw prior to comp letion of all protocol -required visits and are unable or unwilling to continue the 
Schedule of A ssessments  (Table 1 ), the investigator can search publi cally available 
records (where permitted ) to ascertain survival status.   This ensures that the data set(s) 
produced as an outcome of the study is/are as comprehensive as possible.

12.6 Publication Policy  
To coordinate dissemination of data from this study, Amgen may facilitate the formation 
of a publication committee consisting of several investigators and appropriate Amgen staff,  the governance and responsibilities of which are set forth in a Publication Charter .  
The committee is expected to solicit input and assistance from other investigators and to collaborate with authors and Amgen staff as appropriate as defined in the Publication 
Charter .  Membership on the committee (both for investigators and Amgen staff) does 
not guarantee authorship.  The criteria described below are to be met for every 
publication.  
Authorship of any publications resulting from this study will be determined on the basis of the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors  (ICMJE ) Recommendations for 
the Conduct of Reporting, Editing, and Publications of Scholarly Work in Medical Journals , which states:  
• Authorship credit should be based on (1) substantial contributions to conception and 
design, acquisition of data, or analysis and interpretation of data; (2) drafting the 
article or revising it critically for important intellectual content; (3) final approval of the 
version to be published; (4) a greement to be accountable for all aspects o f the work 
in ensuring that questions related to the accuracy or integrity of any part of the work are appropriately investigated and resolved.  Authors  should meet conditions 
1, 2, 3 and 4. 
• When a large, multi center  group has conducted the work, the group should  identify 
the individuals who accept direct responsibility for the manuscript.  These individuals 
should fully meet the criteria for authorship defined above.  
• Acquisition of funding, collection of data, or general supervision of the research 
group, alone, does not justify authorship. 
• All persons designated as authors should qualify for authorship, and all those who 
qualify should be listed.  
• Each author should  have participated sufficiently in the work to take public 
responsibility for appropriate portions of the content. 
All publications (eg, manuscripts, abstracts, oral/slide presentations, book chapters) 
based on this study must be submitted to Amgen for review.  The Clinical Trial 
Agreement among the institut ion, investigator , and Amgen will detail the procedures for, 
and timing of, Amgen’s review of publications.

The Common Toxicity Criteria Version  4.0 is available at the following link:  
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications \ctc.htm  
General United States Food and Drug Administration Guidance on Hepatotoxicity 
Stopping and Rechallenge Rules  
As noted in Section 6.4, a Food and Drug Administr ation Guidance exists for 
drug-induced liver injury  (DILI).  This guidance is general for all investigational and 
marketed products, and is synopsized here as a reference.  It provides criteria for 
reporting, monitoring, and withholding investigational product in the event that a subject 
develops signs or symptoms of hepatotoxicity during a clinical trial.  
Criteria for Permanent Withholding of Investigational Product due to Potential 
Hepatotoxicity  
Investigational product should be discontinued permanently and the subject should be 
followed for possible dru g-induced liver injury, if ALL of the criteria below are met:  
• TBL > 2 x ULN or international normalized ratio > 1.5  
• AND increased AST or ALT from the relevant baseline value as specified below:  
Baseline AST or ALT value  AST or ALT elevation  
≤ 1.5 ULN  > 3 x ULN  
• AND no other cause for the combination of laboratory abnormalities is immediately 
apparent; important potential causes for abnormal AST/ALT or total bilirubin values 
include, but are not limited to the following:  
• obstructive gall bladder or bile duct disease  
• viral or alcoholic hepatitis (eg, hepatitis A/B/C/D/E, Epstein -Barr virus, 
cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus, varicella)  
• progression of malignancy involving the liver (note that metastatic disease to the 
liver, by itself, should not be used  as an explanation for significant AST/ALT 
elevations)  
• hypoxic or ischemic hepatopathy or congestive hepatopathy in association with significant right -sided heart failure  
• concomitant administration of other hepatotoxins, including drugs that inhibit bilirubin glucuronidation (eg, indinavir, atazanavir, irinotecan) or herbal or dietary 
supplements  
• heritable disorders causing impaired glucuronidation (eg, Gilbert’s syndrome); 
alpha- one antitrypsin deficiency  
• autoimmune hepatitis  
• nonalcoholic steatohepatitis or other “fatty liver disease”

Protocol Number:  20110186  
Date:  17 October 2017  Page 67 of 74 
CONFIDENTIAL    It should be noted that some of the circumstances above may nevertheless warrant 
discontinuation of investigational product without requiring assessment for drug- induced 
liver injury.  
Criteria for Conditional Withholding of Investigat ional Product due to Potential 
Hepatotoxicity  
For subjects that do not meet the criteria for permanent withholding of investigational product outlined above, investigational product should be withheld if ANY of the following criteria are met, and t he subject should be evaluated for drug- induced liver injury:   
• Elevation of either AST or ALT according to the following schedule:  
Baseline AST or ALT value  AST or ALT elevation  
Any > 8 x ULN at any time 
Any > 5 x ULN but <  8 x ULN for ≥  2 weeks  
Any > 5 x ULN but <  8 x ULN and unable to adhere to enhanced 
monitoring schedule  
• OR:  clinical signs or symptoms that are, in the opinion of the investigator, consistent 
with hepatitis (such as right upper quadrant pain/tenderness, fever, nausea, 
vomiting, jaundice, rash or eosinophilia >  5%).  If such signs or symptoms are 
coupled with ALT  or AST elevations >  3 x ULN, investigational product should be 
withheld.  
• OR:  total bilirubin >  3 x ULN at any time  
• OR:  alkaline phosphatase >  8 x ULN at any time  
Investigational product should be withheld pending investigation into alternative causes 
of drug -induced liver injury.  If investigational product is withheld, the subject should be 
followed according to recommendations above for possible drug- induced liver injury.  
Rechallenge may be considered if an alternative cause is discovered and the laboratory abnormalities resolve to normal or baseline.   
Criteria for Rechallenge of investigational product after Potential Hepatotoxicity  
The decision to rechallenge the subject should be discussed and agreed upon unanimously by the subject, principal investigator, and Amgen.  
If signs or symptoms recur with rechallenge, then investigational product should be permanently discontinued.  Subjects who clearly meet the criteria for permanent discontinuation should never be rechallenged.

CONFIDENTIAL    Drug -induced Liver Injur y Rep orting & Additional Assessments 
Reporting  
To facilitate appropriate monitoring for signals of DILI, cases of concurrent AST or ALT 
and TBL according to the criteria specified in Section 6.4 (3 x ULN for AST/ALT and 
2 x ULN for TBL)  require the following:  
• The event is to  be reported to Amgen as a serious adverse event within 24 hours of 
discovery or notification of the event (ie, before additional  etiologic investigations 
have been concluded)  
• The appropriate CRF (eg, Adverse Event CRF) that captures information necessary 
to facilitate the evaluation of treatment- emergent liver abnormalities is to be 
completed and sent to the Amgen.  
Other events of  hepatotoxicity and potential DILI are to be reported as serious adverse 
events if they meet the criteria for a serious adverse event defined in Section 9.2.2 . 
Additional Clinical Assessments and Observation  
All subjects in whom investigational product(s) or protocol -required therapies is/are 
withheld (either permanently or conditionally) due to potential DILI as specified above or 
who experience AST or ALT elevations >3 x ULN are to undergo a period of “close 
observation” until abnormalities return to normal or to the subject’s baseline levels.  
Assessments that are to  be performed during this period include:  
• Repeat AST, ALT, ALP, bilirubin (total and direct), and INR within 24 hours  
• In cases of TBL > 2x ULN or INR > 1.5, retesting of liver tests, BIL (total and direct), 
and INR is to be performed every 24 hours until laboratory abnormalities improve 
Testing f requency of the above laboratory tests may decrease if the abnormalities 
stabilize or the investigational product(s) or protocol -required therapies has/have been 
discontinued AND the subject is asymptomatic . 
• Initiate investigation of alternative causes for elevated AST or ALT and/or elevated 
TBL:  
− Obtain complete blood count (CBC) with differential to assess for eosinophilia  
− Obtain serum total immunoglobulin IgG, Anti -nuclear antibody (ANA), Anti 
Smooth Muscle Antibody, and Liver Kidney Microsomal antibody 1 (LKM1) to 
assess for autoimmune hepatitis  
− Obtain serum acetaminophen (paracetamol) levels  
− Obtain a more detailed history of:  
o Prior and/or concurrent diseases or illness  
o Exposure to environmental and/or industrial chemical agents

CONFIDENTIAL    o Symptoms (if applicable)  including right upper quadrant pain, 
hypers ensitivity -type reactions, fatigue, nausea, vomiting and fever  
o Prior and/or concurrent use of alcohol, recreational drugs and special diets  
o Concomitant use of medications (including non -prescription medicines and  
herbal and dietary supplements), plants, and mushrooms  
− Obtain viral serologies  
− Obtain CPK, haptoglobin, LDH, and peripheral blood smear 
− Perform appropriate liver imaging if clinically indicated  
• Obtain appropriate blood sampling for pharmacokinetic analysis if this has not 
already been collected  
• Obtain hepatology consult (liver biopsy may be considered in consultation with an 
hepatologist)  
• Follow the subject and the laboratory tests (ALT, AST, TBL, INR) until all laboratory abnormalities return to baseline or normal.  The “close observation period” is to  
continue for a minimum of 4 weeks after discontinuation of all investigational product(s) and protocol- required therapies.  
The potential DILI event and additional information such as medical history, concom itant 
medications and laboratory results must be captured in corresponding CRFs.

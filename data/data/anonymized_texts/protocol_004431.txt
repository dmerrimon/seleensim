1 PRÉCIS  
1.1 Study Title :  IMPACT -C: Improving Vaccin e Uptake in Skilled Nursing Facilities  
1.2 Objective  
SARS -CoV-2 vaccine, now being administered to  SNF residents  and staff, has highly variable 
acceptance between facilities. We need  to develop and disseminate effective strategies to 
increase vaccination immediately. For S NF residents and staff we will  develop and implement a 
scalable mu lti-pronged intervention that  educat es, builds  trust and supports the informed consent 
process aimed to increase SARS -CoV -2 vaccination. We will compare the rates of vaccination in 
staff and resident s in facilities that receive electronic messaging and education (i.e., ususal care) 
versus  rates in facilities that receive an additional multi- pronged “high touch” intervention.  
 
1.3 Design and Outcomes  
Design  
We will conduct a cluster randomized trial to compare the effect of electr onic messaging and 
education (i.e., usual care) versus a multi- pronged “high touch” intervention  to reduce vaccine 
hesitancy in SNF staff and residents  among a random sample of facilities across four SNF 
chains. As part of the “high touch” intervention, we  will identify and train  local opinion leaders . 
We will offer th ese leaders  assistance through real -time support for questions and provide 
consenting specialists . During the second wave of vaccination, we will provide the intervention 
facilities with posit ive reinforcement for staff and we will identify local champions to garner  
support and empowerment  of staff. Finally, in the intervention facilities we will provide 
additional funds to support  COVID -19 testing, in order that facilities have access to enough 
testing kits  for patient or staff who develops symptoms following vaccination. 
This trial w ill be randomized within 4  SNF chains in order to evaluate the effect of a multi -
pronged strategy to improve SARS -CoV -2 vaccine acceptance among  direct care staff and  long -
stay nursing home residents . In four  chains, eligible facilities will undergo  randomization 
between usual care versus adding  the “high touch” intervention, implemented in two waves. 
Randomization and rol l out of the intervention will occur at the  facility level.   
Outcomes  
The following outcomes related to SARS -CoV -2 vaccination will be measured  during the period 
of vaccine administration and followup:  
PRIMARY OUTCOME :  
A binary meas ure (Yes or No) indicating whether a long stay nursing home resident received any 
doses of a SARS -CoV -2 vaccine, identified by the electronic medical records (EMR)  
 
SECONDARY OUTCOMES:  
IMPACT -C Protocol v1. 5 April 7 , 2021  Number  of direct care st aff who received any  dose of a SARS -CoV -2 vaccine 
 
  
1.4 Interventions and Duration  
The entire trial will take place over 1 1-15 weeks, each intervention facility will be involved in 
approximately 1- 3 week start up activities, 6- 8 weeks of vaccine administration ( in all facilities, the 
vaccine wil l be offered on three dates approximately 3- 4 weeks a apart ), and an additional 4 weeks of data 
collection. I ntervention homes will follow the same timeline for enrollment and data collection. During 
the start -up period in the intervention facilities, the research team works with the leadership and opinion 
leaders in each SNF to optimize program roll -out within each unique environment.   
Numerous educational resources regarding vaccination already exist. Through the American Health Care 
Association (AHCA), our team plans to disseminate electronic messaging and educational material 
regarding the COVID -19 vaccine to 12 SNF chains with some 1,000 facilities including around 100,000 
direct care staff and at least 60,000 long -stay residents. This quality improvement initiative represents 
typical care practices (i.e., usual care), and it will include all facilities  in the four chains that will ta ke part 
in the trial. Select facilities within the four chains will additionally receive the “high touch” intervention, offered in two waves.  
1.5 Sample Size and  Population  
The study sample will include some 150 facilities including around 14,000 direct c are staff and 
at least 8,500 long- stay residents across 4 S NF chains.

3. STUDY OBJECTIVES  
3.1 Primary Objective  
Aim 1 : To conduct a cluster randomized controlled trial (~ 150 facilities  across 4 SNF 
chains) to compare the number  of SNF residents who receive the SARS -CoV -2 
vaccine in facilities with usual care versus facilities randomized to the  multi -pronged 
intervention.  
 H1: We hyp othesize that the intervention  will increase vaccination of S NF resident s 
by at least 10 percentage points  versus facilities usual care alone . 
 
 3.2. Secondary Objectives  
 
 
Aim 2 . To compare the number  of direct care staff who receive a ny SARS -CoV -2 
vaccination in facilities with usual care versus facilities randomized to the multi-pronged intervention.  
 
H2. We hypothesize that staff of NFs with the intervention will have at least a 10 
percentage point greater vaccin e uptake of vaccine than  staff in S NFs that do not 
participate in the high touch intervention  
 
Aim 3 . To determine whether the intervention will mitigate resident  and staff disparities 
in SARS -CoV -2 vaccination by race/ethnicity . 
 
H3. We hypothesize that within  intervention S NFs, improvement s in vaccine uptake 
will be  similar across  staff and resident  race/ethnicities.  
 
Aim 4. To assess the experiences of  opinion leade rs in intervention facilities in terms of 
their perceived barriers to intervention implementation, organizational culture, and overall experience with the intervention.  
 H4: We hypothesize that there will be a high variability in  experiences across facility 
opinion leaders that will inform the results of the trial.    
IMPACT -C Protocol v1. 5 April 7 , 2021   
4. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
Epidemiology of COVID -19 in SNFs.  COVID -19 has disproportionately affected nursing facility 
(NF) staff and residents in the U.S., with the highest rates of infection and mortality in both 
groups.[1, 2]  Facility outbreaks vary geographically  and over time .[3] Aside from morbidity, 
COVID -19 has been extremely costly for NFs due to declining admissions, purchasing of personal 
protective equipment (PPE) [4-6] and testing. It is estimated the U.S. government may pay more 
than $15 billion to cover COVID -19 costs in SNFs alone.[7]  
 
Vaccine availability . Three vaccine candidates are expected to be released in December 2020, 
with S NF direct care staff and resident s scheduled to be in the first group in the country to be 
offered the vaccine. The first two vaccines (Pfizer and Moderna) use a novel microRNA 
technology. Phase two trials have already been conducted on over 50,000 and 30,000 persons for the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, respectively, with demonstrated safety and efficacy  against 
COVID -19.[8]  
 
Staff barriers to vaccination. Despite the promise of these leading vaccine candidates in 
decreasing the rates of COVID -19 and serious illness, there are many barriers to having SNF 
staff receive the vaccine. First,  because the vaccines will all be approved by an Emergency Use 
Authorization (EUA), employers will not be able to mandate that staff receive the vaccine.  Second, in a recent survey of 1,250 Black and Latinx Americans, only 18% of Blacks and 31% of Latinx report that they would definitely get vaccinated if the vaccine were free.[9]  This is 
consistent with historical differences in rates of influenza vaccination among Black and Latinx populations relative to non- Hispanic W hites. [10] A primary reason  many Blacks/Latinx are 
hesitant to accept vaccination is a lack of trust that the vaccine is safe and in the authorities (including their employers) advocating vaccination.[9]  This is alarming in the SNF setting where 
the largest gro up of direct care workers are nursing assistants (NA), and 50% of NA identify as 
Black/Latinx. [11, 12]  A recent survey conducted by the Nationa l Association of Health Care 
Assistants (the major professional organization of NAs), confirmed that most NAs do not plan to be vaccinated for SARS -CoV -2.[13]  Finally, staff may express vaccine hesitancy give a fear of 
side effects and concern they will be unable to work. Point -of-care COVID -19 testing offers a 
practical solution to determine whether staff who exhi bit symptoms following vaccination are 
able to work; however, low resourced facilities are still having difficulty accessing an adequate supply of test kits.[14]  Therefore, we believe that without a multi- pronged intervention to reduce 
vaccine hesitancy  and dispel misinformation, vac cination rates among SNF direct care workers 
will be low , compromising efforts to protect SNF residents.  
 
Resident  barriers to vaccination. There are also major challenges to insuring that SNF resident s 
are vaccinated. First, h istorically Black SNF resident s are less likely to receive influenza and 
pneumococcal vaccines than are White resident s.[5, 6]  Most of this difference has been 
explained by inequities in offer ing the vaccine between facilities  rather than within facility 
differences , although these still remain .[15, 16]  SNFs are highly segregated along racial lines, 
with resource -poor facilities tending to have larger non- white populations . Second, the first two 
vaccines likely to be released require ultra- cold storage meaning SNFs are not equipped to store 
these vaccines. CMS has encouraged SNFs to overcome this barrier by partnering with pharmacy 
IMPACT -C Protocol v1. 5 April 7 , 2021  chains (e.g. Walgreens) that will deliver t he vaccine to staff and residents . Even though verbal 
informed consent will be allowed, knowing how many residents and staff will accept the vaccine, 
prior to the vaccine supplier being at the NH, will be critical to minimize waste and maintain 
maximal eff iciency given the finite staffing resources available to ensure all NHs are offered 
vaccine in a timely fashion. We anticipate organizing the effort and coordination with the 
pharmacy provider will be an enormous barrier for facilities, but in particular, for the resource -
poor facilities with larger Black and Latinx populations who may not have the capacity to 
systematically reach out to families to inquire about willingness to be vaccinated, obtain a verbal or written consent, and manage the documentation needed.  
 
Interventions to reduce disparities in SNFs. Our team has extensive experience in implementing 
interventions to improve healthcare and reduce racial disparities in NFs, including experience with influenza vaccinations.[17- 19] Based on our experience and a review of interventions 
targeting influenza vaccination in S NFs[20], we anticipate that a multi- pronged approach will be 
necessary to overcome these sizeable barriers and successfully implement the SARS -CoV -2 
vaccine among SNF staff and resident s. The multi -pronged approach should include the 
following components:  
1. Electronic Messaging and Education. Messaging promoting prosocial motivations (i.e., 
protecting one’s community from COVID -19) has been demonstrated  to be a stronger 
predictor of willingness to practice preventive behaviors for COVID -19 as compared 
with messaging promoting personal motivations (i.e., protecting oneself from COVID -
19).[21]   This is consistent with systematic reviews of interventions to increase influenza 
vaccination in healthcare workers. [22]  As part of a quality improvement initiative 
through AHCA, we will disseminate videos of  staff from different SNF s stating their 
reason for choosing to be vaccinated. Messages may be d isseminate d by 12 SNF chains 
by email, t ext, and on social media. Messages will have links to Frequently Asked 
Questions (FAQs) on the web as well as broader Public Service Announcements (PSAs). This electronic messaging and education will be considered the ‘usual care’ of the cluster randomized controlled trial described herein.  Only four of these 12 chains will participate in the trial itself.  
2.  Facility Opinion Leader . Our own experience in S NFs suggests that providing 
educational material by itself is less effective in changing behaviors than when a facility champion i s identified  among the direct care staff to reinforce the educational message. [23, 
24] In one trial of influenza immunization among  SNF staff, researchers noted that staff were 
typically siloed by job type,[25]  and thus, multiple leaders should ideally be selected for each 
job type. We plan to identify up to four individuals within each facility who are trusted “opinion leaders ,” and can receive training so that they may more confidently address 
criticism or questions from their peers.   
 
3. Building Trust Locally. Successful response models to prior epidemics including H1N1 and Ebola have required strong community engagement and a “bottom -up” approach.[26]  
We p lan to work with the facility opinion leaders  to identify a local well-  respected member 
IMPACT -C Protocol v1. 5 April 7 , 2021  of the community (e.g., minister, teacher, health care provider) who will help promote trust 
in the SARS -CoV -2 vaccine.  
4. Positive Reinforcement.  Health communicatio n literature suggests that it is equally if not 
more important to address positive emotions (e.g., building altruism and hope) as it is negative emotions (e.g., combatting fear and anxiety) when addressing vaccine hesitancy. [27] Providing staff goodies (e.g., buttons, T -shirts, masks) as well as promoting 
positive images on social m edia have been successful strategies in increasing influenza 
vaccination [20] and improving other health behaviors among S NF staff.  
5. Consenting Specialist.  Low-resource S NFs will have very limited time or ability to 
counsel proxies on the risks and benefits of receiving the SARS -CoV -2 vaccine. A remote 
consenting specialist could overcome this barrier.  
6.  Tes ting Supplies . Phase III trials suggest that as many as 16% of per sons will exper ience 
a fever and  approximately half experience fatigue and headache, particularly after the second 
dose.[8] The CDC has recently provided guidance on the use of point -of-care COVID -19 
testing  following vaccination that may be helpful to determine if staff are able to work or if 
residents  need to be isolated.[28, 29]  We plan to provide additional funds ($10,000) for 
facilities to use to purchase COVID -19 testing kits, so that these  facilities are able to follow 
CDC guidelines  for residents  and staff  who have symptoms after vaccination .  
 
Summary of significance.  
The significance is summarized as follows: 1. COVID -19 has disproportionately affected S NF 
workers and resident s; 2. Several SARS -CoV -2 vaccines are expected to be available starting 
December 2020, and facilities will only have a limited number of opportunities to receive the 
vaccine through a consulting pharmacy company; 3. Direct care staff, many of whom are Black and Latinx, have expre ssed considerable hesitancy regarding the safety of the vaccine; 4. There 
is a history of racial disparities in healthcare across S NFs, including a reduced tendency for 
Black residents to receive influenza vaccines; 5. Obtaining clinical consent for vaccin ation will 
be a second, major barrier to successful vaccination of resident s along with obtaining a firm list 
of staff and residents willing to be vaccinated prior to pharmacy vaccinators coming into the NH to minimize vaccine waste and ensure efficiency ; 6. Low resource facilities often house the 
largest numbers of non -white minority resident s, and it will be challenging for these facilities to 
overcome these sizeable barriers to vaccination without additional support; 7. A multi- pronged 
approach that cent ers on building trust , empowering staff opinion leaders, providing positive 
reinforcement,  easing the process of obtaining informed  consent  for the vaccine , aid in 
organizing the on- site clinic for staff and residents , and ensuring adequate testing supplies  is a 
promising strategy to improve acceptance of SARS -CoV -2 vaccination among staff and 
residents .  
   
IMPACT -C Protocol v1. 5 April 7 , 2021  5. STUDY DESIGN 
This will be a cluster randomized trial where the intervention is applied at the facility level. Our 
primary interest is the effect of this intervention on S NFs that are characterized by having a 
relatively high proportion of resident s who are Black or Lat inx. The 4 SNF chains that have been 
selected have already given assent to participate in this trial. Facilities that are ineligible (e.g., 
institutional instability) have been excluded from the list of facilities for randomization.  
 
We will then stratify  facilities into three categories based on racial composition of residents :  
 
(1) < 25% Black and Latinx residents  
(2) 25-40% Black and Latinx residents  
(3) > 40% Black and Latinx residents  
 
Facilities will undergo constrained randomization within each chain and strat um to ensure that 
the proportion of Black and Latinx residents  is balanced across the intervention arms . We will 
randomize a total of 60 SNFs to the intervention, allocated proportionally across the strata. The 
SNFs that we re removed due to institutional i nstability  will be compared separately to the 
control arm to assess potential bias due to selection into the study.  
 
The Figure below describes the random allocation of facilities:  
 
IMPACT -C Protocol v1. 5 April 7 , 2021   
 
Staff in facilities randomized to intervention arm will be informed by  corporate leadership 
that they will be participating in a program to maximize COVID 19 vaccination among staff and 
residents. They will not be informed that this is part of a trial.  Individual SNFs will be 
randomized to the intervention or usual care; randomization will be stratified by chain and by the proportion of minority residents based on three groups: <25%, 25% -40%, >40%. The research 
implementation team will not be masked to facility assignment. However, the PIs (Mor, Mitchell), the lead statistician (Dr. Goldfeld) and programmers will be masked.  
  

IMPACT -C Protocol v1. 5 April 7 , 2021  6. SELECTION AND ENROLLMENT OF PARTICIPANTS   
The four SNF chains that have been selected to participate in this trial include Vetter, Nexi on, 
Mission, and Genesis (Northeast facilities only). The interve ntion will be rolled out facility -wide . 
Participation  occur s at 3 levels.  SNFs  will be recruite d and enrolled into  the study.  Site 
administrators who agree to participate in the study will serve as gate keepers within their facility. 
Direct care staff will agree to serve as  Opinion Leader s. Resident s within the facility are eligible 
if they qualify as long -stay (defined below).  
6.1 Facility inclusion criteria  
1) Among Genesis corporation, location in the Northeast (PA, NJ, CT, MA, RI, NH , 
VT, ME) AND at least 15% of residents  identify as Black or Latinx.  
6.2 Facility exclusion criteria  
1) Evidence of institutional instability at time of recruitment 
2) Other reason (as determined by the SNF CEO) for inability to participate in the high 
touch intervention 
6.3 Resident  inclusion criteria  
1) Long- stay will be defined as residence in the same facility for at least 100 days with no 
more than 10 days outside the facility  on the date the first round of vaccines were delivered  
6.4  Resident  exclusion criteria  
1) Living in the facility for less than 100 days  
2) Resident  died/transferred during baseline and before the date the first vaccine was 
delivered to the facility  
6.5 S taff inclusion criteria  
1). Staff  (i.e., nurses , care aids , dietary, and housekeeping ) should pr ovide  care in the 
facility  during the time of any of the vaccine clinics .  
6.6 Staff exclusion criteria  
1) Not a “usual” provider within the NH (i.e. visiting hospice provider)  
6.7  Study Enrollment Procedures  
All SNF s in the four  chains are prepared to  receive electronic messaging and educational 
material (i.e., usual care)  through the  American Health Care Association ( AHCA) . Within the 4 
SNF chains that have agreed to participate in the trial, we will ask the CEOs if there are an y 
facilities that should be excluded due to leadership instability or other inability to participate in 
the  multi- pronged intervention. R emaining facilities will be randomized to additionally receive 
the  multi- pronged intervention  versus continuing usual  care.   
IMPACT -C Protocol v1. 5 April 7 , 2021  7. STUDY INTERVENTIONS ADMINISTRATION AND DURATION 
The entire trial will take place over 1 1-15 weeks : each facility in the high touch intervention will 
be involved in approximately 1 -3 week start up activities, 6- 8 weeks of vaccine administration 
(three scheduled deliveries for vaccine approximately 3 -4 weeks a part ), and 4 weeks of data 
collection. Facilities in the usual care group will follow the same timeline for enrollment and 
data collection. During the start- up period in the high touch faciliti es, the research team works 
with the leadership and opinion leaders  in each SNF to optimize program roll -out within each 
unique environment.   
7.1 Usual Care  (Electronic Messaging and Education) .  
All facilities a ffiliated with the AHCA and IMPACT Collaboratory  (12 SNF chains wi th at least 
1,000 facilities) wi ll be offered electronic messaging and education regarding the COVID -19 
vaccine. This material stems from the CDC and AMDA resources and represents a suggested 
approach to reduce vaccine hesita ncy in staff and residents /proxies  (e.g., LARs, POAs) . This 
electronic quality improvement material will be developed as part of a QI initiative and 
disseminated by AHCA to the SNF chains and using social media. Within the trial that includes 4 
of the 12 S NF chains, this will be considered ‘usual care’ in the control arm. Specific examples of 
electronic messaging and education include:  
a. Electronic Messaging – Direct care staff will be encouraged to post a selfie or short video 
encouraging others to get vacci nated. These messages will be disseminated through social 
media (e.g., Instagram). Messages will be linked with PSAs and FAQs regarding 
vaccination that reinforce the safety and efficacy of the vaccine.  
b. PSAs  – Our research team, in conjunction with AHCA, w ill produce a series of short (2- 5 
minute) video(s) designed to promote trust in the safety and efficacy of the SARS -CoV -2 
vaccine, particularly among Black and Latinx direct care workers. The videos will include direct care staff (NA and or floor nurse) g iving a short testimonial about their experience 
with vaccination and promoting altruistic feelings about vaccination for the safety of others. If possible, we will include a short testimonial from a well -respected member of 
society specifically encouragin g vaccination in SNF staff and resident s. SNF leadership 
will encourage all staff to watch these videos during the start- up period as part of regularly 
scheduled team huddles/meetings or individually. In addition, these links will be provided to all proxie s via letter or email, when they receive the FDA mandated Fact Sheet regarding 
the vaccine.  
c. FAQs - The AHCA will additionally disseminate suggested responses for  frequently asked 
questions that staff and resident s/proxies may have about the vaccine. Th is ma terial has  
been reviewed by members of the National Association of Care Health Assistants 
(NACHA). SNF leadership will distribute these widely to staff during the start- up period. 
We will encourage SNFs to include the FAQ sheet to all proxies by letter or  email as part 
of the material distributed with the vaccine Fact Sheet.  
 7.2  HIGH TOUCH MULTI -PRONGED INTERVENTION 
Among four SNF chains, we will randomize eligible facilities to receive an additional “high touch” 
intervention. These high touch facilities  will receive the electronic messaging and educational 
material described above . In addition these facilities will work with our research team on the 
following:  
 
IMPACT -C Protocol v1. 5 April 7 , 2021  1. Facility Opinion Leader . At each intervention facility, our research team will work with 
the facility administration to identify local opinion leaders among nursing assistant s 
(NA) , nurs ing, dietary , and housekeeping . The opinion leaders will participate in the 
following activities: 1) Participate in an initial informational meeting with the resear ch 
team and other facility opinion leaders ; 2) Identify a local champion who could help 
participate in educational materials; 3) Participate in the social media messaging 
described in the Electronic Messaging section above ; 4) Engage the  research team for 
support and problem solving.  
We will invite all of the opinion leaders to participate in a one hour virtual informational 
meeting with members of our research team and other facility leader s. Meetings will be 
organized by discipline (e.g., nursing, dietary ) and SNF chain. We will offer a few make-
up sessions for staff who are unable to attend.  During these meetings we will cover basic information on vaccine safety and efficacy, leaving the majority of time for an  open 
question and answer session. These ses sions will NOT be recorded. Opinion leaders  who 
participate in these meetings will be given a $50 gift card  for their time . 
Our research team will provide opinion leaders with direct contact information (email and phone number) of the study team so that they may ask questions during implementation. Insight Therapeutics will also work to identify a support team that can offer guidance and  
problem solve during implementation .  
2. Consenting Specialist.  Through Insight Therapeutics, our research team will employ 
external staff members to facilitate the clinical consent for vaccination process. Each  
facility will make up to ten referrals of residents  who were not vaccinated during the first 
of the three av ailable vaccine dates  to our consenting specialists .  Consenting specialists 
will contact each proxy, review risks and benefits of the vaccine, and answer questions. We will provide a 1- 800 number for proxies who have additional questions/hesitancy, 
and w e will offer a  group zoom call  for interested proxies to review risks and benefits . As 
indicated, this consenting process will be a clinical consent for the vaccination itself  – not 
a study -specific informed consent process to participate in research.  We a re seeking a 
waiver of informed consent for the overall intervention study.  
 
3. Building Trust Locally. The facility  opinion leaders  will be encouraged to identify well 
respected persons in the community (e.g., minister, teacher, government leader) who are willing to provide a message promoting trust in the vaccine. Through Insight 
Therapeutics, our research team will reach out to these leaders and coordinate the video messages  and implementation plan.  M essages will be distributed widely within a facility 
by email, website, text  and/or social media. Further, our research team will prepare the 
community lea ders to serve as an additional support for the facility opinion leaders 
during implementation.  
4. Positive Reinforcement.  Our research team will create and dis tribute buttons, T -shirts, 
and masks that promote awareness about vaccination (e.g., Ask me about the COVID -19 
vaccine! OR Vaccinated for You!). These items will be distributed through facility leadership at each facility, with recommendations  to give each  staff member these 
goodies  when vaccinated.  
 
IMPACT -C Protocol v1. 5 April 7 , 2021  5. Testing Supplies.  Our research team will provide funds ($10,000) t o each facility in the 
high touch intervention arm, t hat the facilit y may use to acquire additional COVID -19 
testing kits . This will enable frequent testing of any residents  and staff that experience 
symptoms following vaccination. Given that the cost of most point -of-care testing kits is 
around $50, these funds will support the cost of approximately 200 test kits. We will 
suggest that facilities follow the CDC recommendations for testing following 
vaccination. [28, 29]  Our research team will additionally facilitate kits for facilities that 
are experiencing difficulty securing the test kits.  
.  
The high touch intervention will be implemented in two waves. For the first cycle of vaccine 
administration we will focus on identifying opinion leaders and positive reinforcement . During 
the second round we will add building trust locally , a consenting specialist , and testing supplies .  
  
IMPACT -C Protocol v1. 5 April 7 , 2021  8. DATA COLLECTION ELEM ENTS AND PROTOCOL   
8.1 Facility Data  
Nursing home data are collected prior to the start of the study for descriptive purposes and to 
inform the development of a list of eligible facilities for recruitment. These include elements from  Nursing Home Compare, including: the number of beds, hospital -based, special care 
dementia unit, nursing and nursing assistant hours/resident/day, and number of deficiencies on state inspections.  
 8.2 Resident  Data  
Resident  data is already being collected for all facilities within the 4 chains as part of the RADx -
UP supplement. Existing data transfer agreements from all 4 chains have been signed and 
authorized. We  plan to use data from the electronic medical record, as  well as data f rom the 
Minimum Data Set (MDS) for this study. Resident  characteristics will be obtained during 
baseline only (that is during the 3 months before the vaccine is fi rst delivered to the f acility ) 
whereas vaccination data will be obtained during the 6- 8 weeks of implementation and 4 weeks 
of followup.. 
Demographic:   age, gender, race, ethnicity, proxy contact information (for “high touch” facilities 
only in need of consenting specialist) and relationship to resident.  
 
Medical co -morbidity : All active medical diagnoses.  History of COVID -19 infection from 
testing results and diagnoses in EMR .  
Functional status: Katz Activities of Daily Living Scale from MDS; Dementia severity (Cognitive Func tional Scale)  
 
Influenza Vaccination:  Using EMR and MDS data we will also determine if each resident  
received the influenza vaccine during the 2020 -2021 season  
SARS -CoV -2 Vaccination : Using the EMR we will determine if each resident  received any  dose 
of the SARS -CoV -2 vaccine within the vaccine implementation period and 4 weeks from the last 
date the vaccine was delivered to the facility.  
  
IMPACT -C Protocol v1. 5 April 7 , 2021  8.3. Staff data   
Each facility will provide our team with a log of aggregated staff vaccination  (counts of number 
of staff vaccinated) . We will calculate the number of eligible staff in a facility using the Kronos 
time and effort reports  along with Payroll -Based Journal data.  
For Genesis facility only, we will receive additional person level informa tion on staff 
demographics (job description, race/ethnicity) from Human Resources.  
In addition, the facility opinion leaders will be surveyed with regards to their experience of the 
intervention components. This anonymous data will be collected via a Qual trics survey sent 
directly to all opinion leaders.  
  
IMPACT -C Protocol v1. 5 April 7 , 2021  9. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  
 
9.1 General Design : The hypothesis that will be tested is whether facilities that receive the high 
touch multi -pronged intervention will achieve a greater number  of staff and residents  
vaccinated as compared with facilities randomized to usual care.  
 
9.2 Sample Size and Randomization:   
 
9.3 Outcomes  
 
Primary Outcome  – The primary  outcome will be a binary measure (Yes or No) indicating 
whether an eligible resident received any doses of the vaccine during the study period.  
 
Secondary Outcome – The secondary outcome will be the number  of staff that received any dose 
of the vaccine during the study period. This will be the  count of all eligible staff who received 
one or more doses of the vaccine.  
 
We will examine the primary outcome separately by race/ethnicity (defined as White, Black, Latinx, and Other). In one SNF chain (Genesis) we will examine the secondary outcome separately by race/ethnicity.  
 
9.4 Approach   
The treatment effect based on the primary binary outcome will be the estimated odds ratio (OR). The primary outcome will be analyzed at the individual resident level using a mixed effects generalized linear model with a binomial distribution that includes both network fixed effects, race/ethnicity strata -specific fixed effects as well as nursing home- specific random effects:  
 
𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙�𝑃𝑃(𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖=1)
1−𝑃𝑃(𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖=1)�= 𝛽𝛽0+𝛽𝛽1𝑇𝑇𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖+𝛽𝛽2(𝑆𝑆𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖=2) +𝛽𝛽3(𝑆𝑆𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖=3)+𝛼𝛼𝑖𝑖+𝑏𝑏𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 , 
 
where 𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is an indicator variable for resident i in nursing home j /network k, where 𝑘𝑘∈
 (1,2,3,4); 𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖=1 if the resident  received the vaccine and 𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖=0 otherwise . 𝑇𝑇𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is an 
indicator variable for nursing home j /network k; 𝑇𝑇𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖=1 if the nursing home is in the 
interventi on arm and 𝑇𝑇𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖=0 if in the control arm. 𝑆𝑆𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is the strata indicator,  𝑆𝑆𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖∈ (1,2,3).  𝛼𝛼𝑖𝑖 
is the network- specific fixed effect for network k. 𝑏𝑏𝑖𝑖 is the nursing home -specific random effect , 
which has a normal distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation 𝜎𝜎𝑏𝑏. The parameter 𝛽𝛽1is the 
log-OR of vaccination, comparing the odds of vaccination for those in the intervention arm with 
the odds of vaccination for those in the control arm.  
 
We wi ll estimate an odds ratio ( 𝛽𝛽̂1) along with a 95% confidence interval. We will conduct a 
two-sided hypothesis test based on 𝐻𝐻0: 𝛽𝛽1=0 𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣.𝐻𝐻1: 𝛽𝛽1≠0 using an 𝛼𝛼-level 0.05. All analyses 
will be conducted using the latest version of R (currently 4.0.3, R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria).  
 
IMPACT -C Protocol v1. 5 April 7 , 2021  We will use an intention -to-treat approach as our primary analytic approach, including all 
facilities that were randomized to the intervention regardless of implementation of the 
intervention compone nts. Additional exploratory analyses will estimate a complier average 
causal effect to assess the effect of the intervention on those SNFs who fully engage in the 
intervention.  
Because the components of the “high touch” intervention will be rolled out sequentially in waves 
(e.g., first facility champion and  positive reinforcement , then building local trust , consenting 
specialist and additional testing supplies ) we will examine the individual and additive effects of 
program components , if possible . 
 
A similar approach will be used to determine the effect of the high touch intervention on staff 
vaccination.  
 
The logistic model described for the primary analysis will be extended to include race and 
ethnicity indicators as well as interaction terms, to better understand if the treatment effect is 
heterogeneous across different subgroups of residents . 
 9.5 POWER ESTIMATE 
Using the crtpwr.2prop  function in the R package clusterPower (version 0.6.111) , we estimate 
that w ith 60 facilities in the intervention gr oup, w e will have 90% power to observe a difference 
of 10 percentage points  and 80% power to observe a difference of 8 percentage points , under the 
assumption that the probability of vaccination is 70% in the intervention facilities, an intraclass 
correlat ion of 0.05, and average cluster size of 60. This is likely a conservative estimate of the 
intraclass correlation, and we will have 80% power to observe a difference of just 6 percentage 
points if the intraclass correlation is 0.02 and other assumptions re main unchanged (see Figure).  
  

IMPACT -C Protocol v1. 5 April 7 , 2021   
10. HUMAN SUBJECT PROTECTIONS  
10.1 Sources of Data  
Resident  EMR : The residents’ EMR medical  is already being transferred at regular intervals to 
secure servers at Brown University as part of this RADx -UP supplement. This will include 
information the information regarding vaccination  and history of COVID -19 infection.  
Minimum Data Set: We already have DUAs  in place to allow use of MDS data for all 12 S NF 
chains. This  will be used to provide descriptive information about residen ts in the trial.  
Facility logs : Facilities will provide staff COVID -19 vaccination logs (binary counts of the 
number of staff vaccinated). 
Kronos and time  and effort  reporting:  We already have data transfer agreements in place for 
Kronos, and we will be us ing this data to identify the number of eligible staff in each facility.  
Payroll -Based Journal data:  This publicly available dataset via the Centers for Medicare and 
Medicaid Services will provide staffing estimates from total hours worked per day for all study 
facilities.  
Genesis Human Resources Data: We already have data transfer agreements in place to share 
demographic information on staff within the Genesis facility, including age, length of time of employment, and race/ethnicity.  
Proxy name and contac t: In the intervention homes only, our study team and credentialing 
specialists (through Insight Therapeutics) will receive referrals with the name, contact number and relationship of proxies who have not responded to the electronic informed consent reques t in 
the first round of vaccination. This information will be stored securely either in locked cabinets or behind a secure server and will NOT be distributed or used in any of the analysis.  
Opinion leader survey data: We will collect anonymous data from o pinion leaders via a Qualtrics 
survey that will examined at an aggregate level. The information will be stored securely via a secured server.  
11. POTENTIAL RISKS OF S TUDY PROCEDURES  
The study meets criteria for minimal risk. Our intervention to reduce vaccine hesitancy is based on suggestions from experts and recommendations from leading organizations, the risk of harm is low.  
We will request both a waiver of informed consent under the Common Rule and a HIPAA 
waiver of author ization under the HIPAA Privacy Act for resident and staff participation in this 
study.  
11.1 Potential Medi cal Risk to Study Participants  
Data from the Pfizer vaccine Phase II I studies suggests that the risk of adverse events from 
vaccination is low, even in re sident s over the age of 65.[8]  The most common side effects are 
arm pain, followed by fatigue, headache, chills and fever.  Although side effects of the vaccine 
IMPACT -C Protocol v1. 5 April 7 , 2021  itself are not directly related to o ur intervention, we do plan to collect and report information on 
adverse events among residents in all facilities (see description below).  
We do not anticipate any potential psycho -social risks discomforts or inconveniences of study 
procedures beyond thos e encountered in usual care practices.  The intervention provides 
information for proxies and staff about the safety and efficacy of the vaccine. The intervention 
will be rolled out at a facility level. S taff and proxies do not have to view any of the elec tronic 
material or participate in any training sessions that we will provide.  
 
The risk of loss of confidentiality is low. Our team is already collecting this data as part of 
existing data transfer agreements with provisions to keep identifiable data safe. Staff who 
participate in the Opinion Leader training sessions will need to provide their name and facility, in order to re ceive reimbursement with an e- gift card. This list of names will be kept behind a 
secure server and will NOT be distributed or used in any of the analysis. The consenting 
specialists will receive referrals with confidential information including patient an d proxy name. 
This information will be kept behind a secure server and will NOT be distributed or used in any 
of the analyses.  
 
One additional potential burden of this study is the time commitment of the S NF staff in to 
address questions raised by the electronic material we will provide. We will provide staff will a 
list of FAQs that may be helpful. In addition, for the intervention facilities we will offer some training and support  for facility opinion leaders .  
 11.3 Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
This is a study to reduce vaccine hesitancy and w e do not anticipate any study related adverse 
events to occur in this study. Separately, members of our team are monitoring adverse side 
effects of the vaccine in resident s within one S NF chain (Genesis ).  
 
AE/SAE Definitions:  
The study will adhere to the definitions for AEs and SAEs stipulated in the NIA Adverse Event 
and Serious Adverse Event Guidelines  as outlined below.  
 
AE Definition:  AE is any untoward or unfavorable medical occurrence in a human study 
participant, including any abnormal sign (e.g. abnormal physical exam or laboratory finding), symptom, or disease, temporally associated with the participants’ involvement in the research, whether or not considered related to participation in the research.  
 
 
 
SAE Definition: SAEs consist of any adverse event that results in death; requires 
hospitalization; or anaphylaxis/ meets the Centers for Disease Control definition of serious adverse events potentially associated with the vaccine ( CDC weblink
) 
Reporting Procedures  
IMPACT -C Protocol v1. 5 April 7 , 2021  The study team will collect information on SAEs (deaths, hospitalizations, and CDC defined 
potential serious related adverse events) among residents using the Electronic M edical Records 
(EMR). This information is sent securely to Brown University from some facility daily, for other 
data is transmitted weekly or monthly.  
We propose the following reporting schedule for AEs and SAEs:  
• All adverse events that are both serious (S AE) and unexpected  (i.e., have not been 
previously reported for the study's intervention) should be reported to the IRB, NIA PO and to the NIA -Appointed Safety Officer (SO) within 48 hours of the study's knowledge of 
SAE.  
• The summary of all other SAEs should be reported to NIA PO and to the SO  along with 
recruitment and retention milestones, quarterly (unless otherwise requested by the SO). The SO will make recommendations to the  DSMB and the NIA 
PO particularly regarding the  related  SAEs  and recruitment a nd retention milestones.  
Expected SAEs unrelated to the trial intervention are listed in DSMP and include death, 
hospitalization, and vaccine -related adverse reactions as per CDC  (i.e., anaphylaxis) . There 
are no expected SAEs related to the trial intervention which aims to reduce vaccine 
hesitancy . 
• The DSMB provides overall data and safety monitoring oversight for the study and makes 
recommendation to the NIA regarding study continuation.  
• All deaths will be reported to the Safety Officer, IMPACT -C Collab oratory Regulatory and 
Data Team Leader (Julie Lima PhD), Advarra IRB, NIA IMPACT Collaboratory PO (Dr. 
Partha Bhattacharya) within 24 hours  of study’s knowledge of death.  
• AEs will be reported per IRB policies and also to IMPACT Collaboratory Regulatory and 
Data Team Leader (Julie Lima PhD), Advarra IRB, NIA IMPACT Collaboratory PO (Dr. 
Partha Bhattacharya), and the IMPACT Collaboratory DSMB Chair (or the project’s Safety 
Officer at minimum every 6 months, or at a frequency requested by NIA and/or by the 
DSMB.  
 
11.2 Safety Monitoring 
As agreed upon by the NIA and overseei ng project officer, Dr. Partha  Bhattacharyya , safety 
monitoring will be the responsibility of a Data Safety Monitor  (DSM). Additionally, the project 
officer will appoint a Safety Officer. Given the urgent need to begin this study immediately, we 
will review any issues raised by the data safety monitoring officer simultaneously with IRB 
review . Similarly, given the very short timeline for vaccine administration in S NFs, we will not 
plan an interim DSM meeting, but we will provide the project officer and SO the SAE reports 
quarterly, or sooner if available , and they will notify DSMB of related SAEs .   The  DSM  may  
determine the need to stop the continuation of the study based on examination of these reports.  
12. INTERVENTION DISCONT INUATION  
The study may be discontinued at any time by the IRB, the NIA, OHRP or other government agencies as part of their duties to ensure that research participants are protected. Individual S NFs 
in the intervention arm may withdraw from study participation at any time at the discretion of their senior management or corporate supervisors. Staff and proxies  or residents  can opt out of 
IMPACT -C Protocol v1. 5 April 7 , 2021  viewing  any of the electronic material we will provide .  Facilities may choose to implement only 
some of the intervention. Variation in implementation is expected in clinical practice and as part 
of this pragmatic trial.

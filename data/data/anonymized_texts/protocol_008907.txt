1.0 OBJECTIVES  
Primary objective:  
1. Determine the response rate (2008 IWCLL/NCI -WG criteria) to treatment 
with single -agent ofatumumab in previously untreated, early -stage, high-
risk patients with CLL/SLL . 
 
Secondary objectives:  
1. Determine the time- to-progression for high-risk patients treated with 
ofatumumab.  
2. Determine the time- to-next chemoimmunotherapy or alternative therapy.  
3. Evaluate the pharmacokinetics of single- agent ofatumumab in high-risk, 
previously untreated patients with CLL/SLL . 
4. Evaluate for circulating CD20+ cells through treatment and in follow -up in 
high-risk patients treated with ofatumumab.  
5. Evaluate safety and toxicities of ofatumumab in previously untreated high-risk patients with CLL/SLL . 
 
2.0 BACKGROUND  
 Rationale  
Ofatumumab has signific ant single -agent activity in treating patients with CLL 
refractory to fludarabine and alemtuzumab (FA -ref) and fludarabine- refractory 
patients with bulky (>5cm) lymph nodes (BF -ref), as demonstrated by the interim 
analysis of the pivotal trial
1. The overall response rate ( ORR) for FA -ref (n=59) and 
BF-ref (n=79) was 58% and 47%, respectively. The median duration of response 
(median) for both populations was approximately 6 months. Treatment with ofatumumab was very well tolerated. This fully human monoclonal antibody against CD20 binds to a unique epitope composed of the small - and large- loop domains and 
is highly effective at fixing complement for complement -dependent cytotoxicity (CD C). 
In vitro  studies demonstrated higher levels of CDC against primary CLL cells and cell 
lines with ofatumumab compared to rituximab
2,3.  In addition, a phase I/II trial of 
single -agent ofatumumab in relapsed patients with CLL demonstr ated an ORR of 
50% in the 26 patients treated with ofatumumab 500 mg followed by 3 weekly doses of 2000 mg (4 total doses). This treatment was well tolerated with the most common side effect being infusion- related reactions
4. 
 Ofatumumab was combined with fludarabine (F) and cyclophosphamide (C) (O -FC) 
in a multi -center, Phase II randomized trial of 2- dose levels ofatumumab (500 versus 
1000 mg) for treatment of previously untreated patients with CLL
5.  First course 
ofatumumab was 300 mg in both dose cohorts and both cohorts received F 25 mg/m2 
and C 250 mg/m2, both daily for 3 days of each 4- wk course.  There were 31 patients 
and 30 patients randomized to the 500 and 1000mg cohorts, respectively.  This chemoimmunotherapy regimen was active and well tolerated.  There were no statistically significant differences in efficacy or safety parameters between the dose 
cohorts.  The CR rate for the 500 and 1000 mg cohorts was 32 and 50%, respectively ; the ORR for the 500 and 1000 mg cohorts was 77 and 73%, 
Protocol 2010- 0241  
March 26, 2014  
Version 8 
Page 3 of 18  
respectively.  There were  no ofatumumab infusion -related reactions  ≥ grade 3.  
Myelosuppression was the most frequent adverse event with O -FC regimen .  This is 
a promising chemoimmunotherapy regimen and merits further study  in frontline and 
previously treated patients with CLL. 
 Prior clinical trials demonstrated activity for rituximab in treating early -stage, 
treatment -naïve high-risk ( β2M ≥ 3 mg/L) CLL
6.  The treatment was 8 weekly doses 
of rituximab 375mg/m2.  Patients were previously untreated,  high-risk by elevated 
β2M (≥  3 mg/L).  There were 34 patients enrolled and treated.  The CR rate was 9%, 
nPR was 21%, and PR was 53% (ORR 82%).  The median time to treatment failure (N=34) was 27 months and the median time to progression for responders (N -28) 
was 43 months. Responses and response duration will be compared to this historical trial. Time to first chemoimmunotherapy will be evaluated based on observed versus expected (O/E) ratio using the MDACC CLL database and multivariable models with nomog rams developed to predict time to chemoimmunotherapy based in presenting 
characteristics.   Given the activity and tolerability of ofatumumab, it is an ideal 
candidate to evaluate for single- agent activity in early -stage, high- risk patients with 
CLL.  
 The o verall objective of this phase II study is to evaluate the efficacy of ofatumumab 
in treating high- risk, watch -and-wait, treatment -naïve patients with CLL/SLL to delay 
time to first chemoimmunotherapy treatment.   For this clinical trial, patients will be 
defined as high- risk for progression based on the presence of one of the following: 
Rai stage II, serum beta- 2 microglobulin ( β2M) of ≥ 3 mg/L, absolute lymphocyte 
count ≥ 25,000/µL, unmutated ( ≤ 2%) IGHV  gene or mutated IGHV3 -21, ZAP70 
positive, CD38 posit ive (≥ 30%), or 11q or 17p deletion by FISH .

 5.0 TREATMENT PLAN  
This is a single -arm, open label, phase II trial of single- agent ofatumumab.  
 Patients will re ceive ofatumumab 300 mg dose 1, then 1000 mg weekly for 7 
additional weekly doses (8 doses). All dose s will be administered at MDACC. 
Allopurinol 300 mg PO daily for the first 7 days of course 1 is recommended for tumor lysis prophylaxis.  
 There are no required prophylactic antibiotics.  Herpes virus and PCP prophylaxis may be given at the discretion of the treating physician but is recommended for patients with recent or concurrent corticosteroid use.  
 Growth factors (neutrophil, erythrocyte, platelet) may  be used at the discretion of the 
treating physician, if clinically indicated.  
 Pre-medication for each ofatumumab infusion must be given within 30 minutes to 2 
hours prior to the infusion:

infusion at the discretion of the treating physician.  
 
First Infusion of 300 mg ofatumumab 
Protocol 2010- 0241  
March 26, 2014  
Version 8 
Page 9 of 18  
The f irst dose administered of ofatumumab will be 300 mg to minimize infusion 
reactions .  The initial rate of the first infusion of 300 mg  ofatumumab (0.3mg/ml) 
should be 12mL/h.  If no infusion reactions occur the infusion rate can be increased 
every 30 minutes, to a maximum of 200 mL/h, according to Table 2.   
 
Table 2.  Infusion rate at 1st Ofatumumab Infusion  
Time  mL/hour  
0 – 30 minutes  12 
31 – 60 minutes  25 
61 – 90 minutes  50 
91 – 120 minutes  100 
121 – 150+ minutes  200 
 If an infusion reaction develops,  the infusion should be temporarily slowed or 
interrupted. Upon restart, the infusion rate should be half of the infusion rate at the time the infusion was paused. If, however, the infusion rate was 12 mL/hour before the pause, the infusion should be restarted at 12 mL/hour. Hereafter, the infusion rate may be increased according to the judgment of the investigator, in the manner described in this section.  
 Subsequent infusion of full dose (1000 mg) ofatumumab If the previous infusion was completed without grade ≥ 3 infusion- associated AEs, the 
subsequent infusion of the first full dose of ofatumumab can start at a rate of 25 mL/hour and can be doubled every 30 minutes up to a maximum of 400 mL/h, 
according to Table 3.  
 Duration of the infusion will be approximately 4 hours if this schedule is followed. If the previous infusion was completed with grade ≥ 3 infusion- associated AEs, the 
subsequent infusion should start at a rate of 12 mL/hour according to Table 3.

There are no proposed or planned ofatumumab dose reductions for toxicities. 
Toxicities will be addressed by escalating premedication, slowing the infusion rate or delaying planned dose as determined by the treating physician.  
 
6.0 PRETREATMENT EVALUATION  (To Be Done Day ≤ -21; TABLE 4 ) 
 6.1 Patients will have a complete history and physical examination.  
 6.2 Laboratory studies will include CBC, platelet count, differential count, blood 
chemistries (SMA 12) (bilirubin, creatinine, albumin, LDH), serum β-2 
microglobulin, pregnancy test for women of childbearing potential, bone 
marrow aspirate (flow cytometry) and biopsy with samples sent for morphology. Hepatitis B (HB) serologies will be performed including HBsAg,  
HBsAb, and HBcAb.  For HBcAb
+ (HBsAb+/-) individuals, HB virus DNA PCR 
will be performed.  
  6.3 Prognostic factors will be characterized including immunoglobulin heavy chain 
variable gene ( IGHV)  family and mutation status; leukemia cell expression of 
ZAP-70, CD38, and CD49d; thymidine kinase; chromosome abnormalities by 
FISH (13q del, +12, 11q del, and 17p del); and p53 expression.  If bone 
marrow evaluation is done within 3 months of enrollment, this will not need to be repeated.  In these cases, if there  is any prognostic factor information 
missing, this can be obtained from blood.  If IGHV  mutation status and ZAP70 
were previously determined at any time, they do not need to be repeated.  
 6.4 Staging CT of chest, abdomen, and pelvis will be done within 2 months  of 
treatment.  Any other appropriate radiological and radioisotope examinations should be performed as clinically indicated.  
 6.5 Pretreatment optional blood (20 ml) will be taken to isolate and store mononuclear cells, DNA, RNA, and plasma.  Also, pretreatment optional bone 
marrow will be taken (5 ml) to isolate and store cells, DNA, RNA and marrow plasma.  Not all samples will be collected in all patients at all time points.  
 7.0 EVALUATION DURING STUDY  
 7.1 Monitoring during treatment will consist of weekly (± 3 days) blood counts and 
chemistries  (through C1D50), then every 3 months (±2 weeks) during follow -
up until alternative treatment for CLL/SLL  or death, whichever occurs first.  A 
physician will see patients at least monthly ( ±5 days) during treatment.  A mid -
level provider may evaluate patients weekly ( ±2 days) during treatment (8 
weeks) when not seen by the physician.   
 7.2 Follow -up visits will include PE with vital signs, interval  history, toxicity/adverse 
event assessment,  CBC with differen tial, and SMA12.  Bone marrow 
examinations (aspirate, biopsy, and MRD evaluation) will be done at response 
Protocol 2010- 0241  
March 26, 2014  
Version 8 
Page 11  of 18  
assessment (at least 2 months after last dose of ofatumumab) to confirm 
complete remission,  then annually . 
 7.3 Patients will be followed at MDACC for all visits including follow -up, response 
assessment 3 months after the last ofatumumab dose, and at least annually.  
Patients will be considered off study when they start alternative treatment for their CLL.  
 7.4 For patients who are HBsAg
-, HBcAb+, HBsA b+/-, and HBV DNA- on enrollment 
and who proceeded with treatment, HBV DNA PCR testing will be done every 
2 months while on treatment, then every 3 months during follow -up for 6 
months.   Consult with a physician experienced in care and management of 
subjec ts with hepatitis B to manage/treat subjects who are anti -HBc positive.  
Initiate anti -viral therapy if required.  If a subject ’s HBV DNA becomes positive 
during the study, notify the GSK medical monitor.  For subjects who have not 
completed planned ofatumumab therapy, discuss with the medical  monitor the 
risks and benefits of continuing or discontinuing ofatumumab before appropriate treatment decisions are made for that individual subject.  
 7.5  Information regarding concomitant medications will not be collec ted for 
patients on this study.  This information is routinely collected and recorded as part of the patient’s electronic record.  If there is a need to refer to this, it will be available.

8.0 RESPONSE CRITERIA AND TOXICITY EVALUATION  
Responses will be assessed according to the 2008 IWCLL guidelines (Table 5)7 at 
MDACC.  Reponses will be evaluated by physical examination; CBC; CT of chest, abdomen, pelvis; and for individuals in complete remission bone marrow aspirate and 
biopsy with evaluation of residual disease (MRD) by 4- color flow cytometry at least 3 
months after completing ofatumumab.

 Non-hematologic toxicity will be assessed, summarized and g raded according to the 
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 4.0.  Hematologic toxicity will be assessed, summarized and graded according to the 2008 IWCLL Guidelines (Table 6).  
 8.1    ADVERSE EVENT DOCUMENTATION Adverse events will be documented in the medical record and entered into the case report form (CRF) according to the Leukemia –Specific Adverse Event Recording and 
Reporting Guidelines (Appendix  E). PDMS/Core will be used as the CRF report form 
for this protocol.  The Investigator or physician designee is responsible for verifying and providing source documentation for all adverse events and assigning the attribution for each event for all subjects enrolled on the trial.  The Investigator will 
sing and date the PDMS CRF toxicity pages for each patient at the completion of each course.  Following signature, the CRF will be used as source documentation for the adverse events attribution.

4 ≥ 75% < 500  
Death occurring as a result of toxicity at any level of decrease from pretreatment will be 
recorded as grade 5.  
* PLT counts must be below normal levels for grades 1- 4.  If, at any level of decrease, the 
PLT count is < 20K/ µl, this will be considered grade 4 toxicity, unless there was severe or 
life-threatening low initial PLT count (< 20K/ µl) pretreatment, in which case the patient is 
not evaluable for toxicity referable to PLT count.  
** HGB levels must be below normal levels for grades 1- 4.  Baseline and subsequent HGB 
determinations must be performed before any giv en transfusions.  
*** If the absolute neutrophil count (ANC) reaches <1000/ µl, it should be judged to be grade 
3 toxicity.  If the ANC was <1000 /µl before therapy, the patient is not evaluable for toxicity 
referable to the ANC.

10.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
This is a phase II, open label, single -arm study. Sample size calculation will be based 
on the CR rate. The objective is to demonstrate a 20% CR rate for patients treated 
with single -agent ofatumumab. A CR rate of 9% was achieved in a previous phase II 
clinical trial with single -agent rituximab in a similar patient population. Simon’s two-
stage MinMax design will be used to assess efficacy in this study. In particular, a sample size of 44 is chosen to differentiate between a good response rate of 20% and a poor response rate of 9% at the significance level of 0.10 with 80% power. In 
particular, 25 patients will be enrolled at the first stage. If there is 1 or fewer responders among 25, the trial will be terminated due to lack of efficacy; otherwise an additional 19 patients will be treated resulting in a total of 44 patients. If there are 6 or fewer responses among 44 patients, the treatment will be concluded ineffective. The probability of early termination due to futility is 0.33.  
 The probability of toxicity will be monitored based on a beta- binomial model, 
assuming a priori that p = Prob(toxicity) ~ beta(1, 1). The trial will be terminated if 
Prob(p> .15| data) ≥ .9. This rule will stop the trial if [#patients with toxicity]/[#patients 
evaluated] ≥ 3/7, 4/12, 5/17,6/22, 7/27, 8/32, 9/37, or 10/42. The operating 
characteristics for toxicity are summarized in Table 7.

Toxicity events, for purposes of safety monitoring, will be defined as ofatumumab-related grade ≥ 4 toxicity by CTCAE V 4 .0 that persist longer than 1 week despite 
holding drug and/or dose reduction.  
 Descriptive statistical analysis will be used to explore the data, including histograms or box -plots, proportions, means, standard deviations. The Fisher’s exact test or Chi -
square test will be used for the univariable analysis on categorical variables (response variable with Yes versus No, for example). The t -test or Wilcoxon test will 
be used for continuous variables. The Kaplan -Meier survival analysis will be 
performed to estimate the overall survival and event -free-survival. The log -rank test 
will be used to assess the difference of survival functions between two groups.  Toxicity will be reported by type, frequency and severity.

 13.0 SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING REQUIREMENTS  
Serious Adverse Event Reporting (SAE)  
A serious adverse event is – any adverse drug experience occurring at any dose that results 
in any of the following outcomes:  
 
• Death 
• A life -threatening adverse drug experience – any adverse experience that places the 
patient, in the view of the initial reporter, at immediate risk of death from the adverse 
experience as it occurred. It does not include an adverse experience that, had it 
occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.  
• Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization 
• A persistent or significant disability/incapacity – a substantial disruption of a person’s 
ability to conduct normal life functions.  
• A congenital anomaly/birth defect. 
  
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life- threatening, or require 
hospitalization may be considered a serious adverse drug experience when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. 
Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive 
treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not 
result in inpatient hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse (21 
CFR 31+ 2.32).  
 
• Important medical events as defined above, may also be considered serious 
adverse events. Any important medical event can and should be reported as an 
SAE if deemed appropriate by the Principal Investigator or the IND  Sponsor, 
MDACC IND Office.  
 
• All events occurring during the conduct of a protocol and meeting the definition of a 
SAE must be reported to the IRB in accordance with the timeframes and procedures 
outlined in “University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center Institutional Review 
Board Policy on Reporting Serious Adverse Events”.  Unless stated otherwise in the 
protocol, all SAEs, expected or unexpected, must be reported MDACC IND Office, 
regardless of attribution (within 5 working days of knowledge of the event).  
 
• All life -threatening or fatal events, expected or unexpected, and regardless of 
attribution to the study drug, must have a written report submitted within 24 hours 
(next working day) of knowledge of the event to the Safety Project Manager in 
MDACC IND Office.   
 
• The MDACC “Internal SAE Report Form for Prompt Reporting” will be used for reporting to MDACC IND Office.  
 
Protocol 2010- 0241  
March 26, 2014  
Version 8 
Page 18  of 18  
• Serious adverse events will be captured from the time the patient signs consent 
until 30 days after the last dose of drug. Serious adverse events must be 
followed until clinical recovery is complete and laboratory tests have returned 
to baseline, progression of the event has stabilized, or there has been acceptable resolution of the event.  
 
• Additionally, any serious adverse events that occur after the 30 day time period 
that are related to the study treatment must be reported to MDACC IND Office. 
This may include the development of a secondary malignancy.  
 
Reporting to FDA:  
 
• Serious adverse events will be forwarded to FDA by the IND Sponsor (Safety Project 
Manager MDACC IND Office) according to 21 CFR 312.32.  
 
It is the responsibility of the PI and the research team to ensure serious adverse 
events are reported according to the Code of Federal Regulations, Good Clinical 
Practices, the protocol guidelines, the sponsor’s guidelines, and Institutional Review 
Board policy.  
 
All serious adverse events will also be forwarded to GSK according to  their guidelines.

Page 106.RATIONALE AND BACKGRO UND
Tofacitinib 5 mg immediate release for mulation (IR) was approved for a twice dail y (BID) 
dosing schedule by the Food and Drug Administratio n (FDA) in November 2012 for the 
treatment of a dult patients with moderatel y to severely active rheumatoid arthrit is who have 
hadan inadequate response or intolerance to methotrexate .In February , 2016, an 11 mg 
once a day  (QD) modified release tablet (X R) for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis was 
approved in the United States.  It may  be used as monotherapy  or in c ombination with
methotrexate (MTX) or othe r conventional s ynthetic disease -modify ing antirheumatic drugs 
(csDMARD s
). Since approval, little i s known about the effect of tofacitinib on patie nt 
outcomes relative to biologic d isease -modify ing antirheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) among 
rheumatoid arthritis (RA) pati ents in the real world. Biologic DMARDs currently  approved 
for RA include: Tumor -Necrosis F actor -
alpha inhibitors (TNFi) [adalimumab (Humir a), 
etanercept (Enbrel), certolizumab pegol (Cimzia), golimumab (
Simponi), inflixi mab 
(Remicade)] and non -TNFi’swith alternative mechanisms of action [abatacept (Orencia), 
and rituximab (Rituxan), anakinra ( Kineret), tocilizumab (Actemra)]. Biologic DMARD s 
have been used for man y years to treat RA with vary ing levels of success; howeve r, no study  
has compared the effectiveness and treatment patterns of tofacitinib to bDMARD s in a real 
world setting.
A simila r comparative analy sis focusing on the earl y expe rience with tofacitin ib was 
previously  conducted. This analy sisis designed to pro vide an updated charact erization of 
medication effectiveness and health care cost and utilization in RA patients treated wit h 
tofacitinib vs. bDMARD s in the period foll owing the initial introduction of tofacitinib , as 
well as a compariso nof the tofacitini b 11 mg QD and tofacitinib 5 mg BID formulations.
7.RESEARCH QUESTION AN D OBJECTIVES
The primary and secondary objectives will be conducted among patients who are identif ied 
from the Truven Health MarketScan Research
Database.
7.1.Primary Obje ctive
To compare RA -related costs among pa tients treated with tofacitinib (IR, XR and combined 
groups) to patients treated with each of the bDM ARD s (individually , as well as to TNFi and 
to non- TNFi each combined as groups).
7.2.Secondary Objectives
Explore the differences in dem ographic and clinical c haracteristics between patients 
treated with tofacitinib vs. each individual bDMARD
.
Compare treatment patterns including dosing, concomitant med ication use,
adherence, persistence, and switching with tofacitinib v s. each individual bDMARD .
Compare all -causeand RA-related health care utilization of patients treated with
tofacitinib vs. each individual bDMARD .

Compar emedication effectiveness among patients treated with tofacitinib vs.each 
individual bDMARD .
8. RESEARCH METHODS 
8.1.Study Design
To address theobjectives, a retrospective cohort design wi ll be employ edto evaluate patient
characteristics, treatment patterns ,medication effectiveness, and health car ecost and
utilization in RA patients newly initiating tofacitinib or bDMARD s between 
01February 2016and 31 July 2019 utilizing the Truven HealthMarketScan Research
Database, seeSection 8.7below.
In choosing the January  
2014, there will have been potentially two y ears of tofa citinib 
RAprescribing , and 
it is less likely that patien ts in later-line treatment will predominate. 
8.2. Setting
This study willutilize the de- identified claims data in the Truv en Health MarketScan
Research Database.
8.2.1. Inclusion Criteria
This study will include individual s who are privately insured (Truven MarketSc an 
Commercial Claims and Encounters (CCAE) database) and with Medicare Supplemental 
insurance paid for by their employ ersand treated with tofacitinib or bDMARD sfor RA 
between 01 February  2016 and 31 J uly2019. To be included in the final study sample, 
patien
tsmust meet thefollowing inclusion criteria:
1.At least one clai m for methotrexate during the variable -length pre -index period.
2.At least one claim for tofacitinib orbDMARD sbetween
01 February  2016 and
31 July 2019 (the identification period).
Medication index date:For patients treated with bDMARD s or tofacitinib, theindex 
date will be the date of the first claim for bDMARD s or tofacitinib during the
identification period.
3.Continuously enrolled in a commer cial (CCAE) or Medicare Supplemental insuran ce 
planfor at least one yearbefore the index date through at leas t 1year after the index
date.
Note: Patients will have a variable length baseline of at least a year long. The baseline period 
will be censored at January  1, 2012 based on licen sed data av ailability .  The majority  of 
baseline measures will use data from the 12 months immediately  prior to the index date. 
Select measures will use data during the entire variable length baseline.

8.5. Period of Observation
All patients will be required to be continuously enrolled in the health plan for at least 
24 months.  Patients will have a variable length baseline period of at least 12 months. The12 months prior to the index date will be used to assess the majority of pre-indexcharacteristics. However, for select measures, eg, use of methotrexate, number of priorbDMARD therapies, and, years since first RA diagnosis, the entire variable length baseline period will be utilized.
Measures utilizing the variable length baseline are noted. All baseline periods will be
censored at January 1, 2012.  The twelve months following the index date will be used toassess outcomes including treatment patterns, and health care costs, utilization andmedication effectiveness.
8.6. Variables
8.6.1. Patient Characteristics
•Index month/year: The month and year of the patient’s index date will be identified.
•Age: Age will be defined as of the index year.
•Age groups: Patients will be assigned to one  of the following age groups: 
18–44, 45–64, and 65+.

Page 148.6.2. C linical Characteristics
Pre-index bDMARD use: The useofbDMARD sduring thepre-index period will be
identified. In addition, indicator variables will identify the specif ic bDMARD (s) used
during th e pre- index period.  A count will be creat ed to identify the number of
different bDMARD s received during the baseline. These measures will be created
during the 12 month baseline and during the e ntire variable length baseline per iod.
Pre-index csDMARD use: The use of csDMARDs (methotrexate, sulfa salazine,
hydroxy chloroquine, etc., other csDMARDs )willbeidentified during the pre -index
period. In addition, indicator variables will identify the specific medications used 
during the pre-index period.  A coun t will be created to identify the num ber o f 
different csDMARDs received during the baseline. These measures will be created 
during the 12 mont h baseline and during the entire variable length basel ine period.
Combination
vs.monotherapy: whether the patien tis treated with combination
therap y(ie,treated with anycsDMARDs ) or monotherap yat index will be
determined. Patients with ause of at least one of four specific cs DMARDs
(methotrexate, sulfasalazine, hydroxy chloroquine, leflunomide ) within 90 day s o n or 
after the index date willbeconsider ed as being treated with combination therapy .
Pre-index Quan -Charlson comorbidity score: A comorbidity score will be
calculated based onthepresence of diagnosis codes onmedical claims i nthe 
12-months pre-index period.2,3  The Quan -Charlson comorbidity score will also be
categorized intothefollowing groups: zero,onetotwo, three tofour, andfiveor 
more.
Pre-index medi cations -Themost common medications used
during the12-month
pre-and post -index periods will be identified. Themost common 25medications
received will be identified.
Opioid, non-steroidal an ti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use
-The use of weak
and/or strong opioids and/or non- steroidal anti -inflamma torydrug (NSAID) during
the 12- month pre-and 12-month post-index periods will be identified. The number of
pharmacy claims for opioids 
and/or NSAIDs and the number of daysfrom the index
date to the first opioi dand/or NSAIDs claim willbeidentified .
Opioid, NSAID use while persist ent. In addition to opioid/NSAID use during the
follow -up,use of opioids/NSAIDs while persistent and after persistence w ill be
identified inthe12-month follow -up period.
Corticost eroid use.  The use of oral corticostero idsduring the 12-month pre-and
12-month post-index periods will be identified. Inaddition, the tota l 
prednisone -equivalent dose of oral corticosteroids
will be calculated.

Page 15Note: The total dose for corticosteroids is calculated as the sum(prednisone 
equivalent dose of administered corticosteroids) divided by  the maximum of day s 
supplied for medication given on the same date, and then averaged over all da tes on 
which patient was given c orticosteroid s .
Pre-index visit with a rheumatologist.  A 0/1 flag wil l be created to determine if the
patient had an ambulatory visits (office visit or outpatient visit) in which the phy sician
was a rheumatologist in the 90 day sbefore or on the index date . Aseparate variable 
will b e created identify ingthe number of visits with a rheumatologist during the 
entire 12 -month baseline.  A flag will also be created identify ingthe presence of a
rheumatologist visit in the entire variable length baseline and th e number of visits in 
the var iable length baseline.
Disease duration .  The num ber of daysfrom the earliest claim with a diagnosis of
RA in the variable length baseline until the index date will be identified. Disease
duration will only be created during the variable length baseline .
Pre-index Out-of-pocket expenses. The patient’s total all-cause and RA -related out
of pocket healthcare cost for healthcare services in 
theoneyear before the index date
and during the entire variable length baseline period will be calculated.
Comorb idities of interest. 0/1 flags will be cre ated to identify the presence of the
following comorbidities during the 12-month baseline period.
Cardiovascular diseases ;
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) ;
Asthma ;
Kidney disea se;
Diabetes ;
Depressio n;
Anxiety ;
Liver disease ;

Non-persistence. A 0/1 flag will be created to ide ntify if the patient is not persistent
with their index bDMARD before the end of the 12month follow-up period.  
Non-persistence will be identified based ona gap in treatment with the index
medication or switching to another bDMARD .
Among patients with 1 year of follow -up, persistence through the end of the 1 yearfollow-up 
willbeidentified. Persist ence willbe identified based on the day  suppl y(or pre sumed day
supply )and fill dates of claims for the index medication (see Table 2for a listing of 
presumed da ysupplies) .
Persistence with the index medication will be defined as not having agap in therap y of at 
least 60 day sbetw eenfills/infusions.  For retail pharmacy (RX) claims the day suppl y will be 
utilized. ForHealthcare Common Procedure Codi ng System(HCPCS) claims a presumed 
daysupply derived from the product label will be utili zed. A gap of at least 60 daysbetween 
the run-outdate (service date + daysuppl y-1)and the next service date willbe considered 
non-persist ence. Patients with earlyrefills will be allowed to accumulate a s tockpile of the 
index medication of up to 14 daysfor later use.  Please see Section 8.11, for additional details 
on gap andvariables needed .
Post persistence treatment pattern s.Patients who are not persistent for the entire
follow -upperiod will be classified into the foll owing mutuall y exclusive categories
based on the first occurrence of non -persistence: switch immediate ly,discontinue
then restart, discontinue then switch, discontinue and never switch or r estart.
Switch immediate ly.Patients will be classified as switc hing immediatel yifthey
initiate a non-index bDMARD before a 60-daygap in treatment is observed for 
theindex medication.
Discontinue then restart.   Patie nts will be classified as discontin uing and then
restarting if there is agap in the index therapy  of at least 60 daysand the first
medication observed after the gap is the index medication.
Discontinu e then switch.  
Patients will be classified as discont inuing and then
switching ifthere isagapinthe index th erapy of at least 60 day sand the first 
medication observed after thegapisabDMARD (including Tofacitinib) different 
from index medication.
Discontinue without switch or restart. Patients will b e classified as discontinuing 
witho ut switch or restart if they have a gap in therapy of at least 60 daysand there are 
no claims for either the index med or a different bDMARD forthe remainder of the 
follow -up period.
Switch any time
.In addition to th e 4mutually exclusive treatment pa tterns, patients
with aswitch medication anytime during the 12- month follow -up period will be
identified.

who have aclaim for the index medication anytime after the y are considered 
non-persistent with the index treatment ( i e,includ ing after switching) durin g the
12-month follow -up,will be identified.
Medication Possession Ratio (MPR): The MPR will be evaluated as the total days
supply between the first and including the last prescriptio
n/administration divided by
the time betw eenthe first through andincluding last bDMARD prescription or 
administration dayssupply . For infus ibleproducts (except rituximab), the presumed 
days supply is in Table 2.For MPR calcu lations, multiple prescriptions having sa me 
fill date will be treated as one prescription with longest dayssuppl y; and for all 
prescriptions day ssuppl y will be c apped at end of follow -up. Also, th e MPR will be 
capped at 1.0.
Proportion of Day s Covered (PDC):
For all medications (except rituxima b) aproportion of day scovered (PDC) willbe
calculated based on total dayssuppl yover the 1yearfollow -up. The PDC w ill be
calculated by using the date of service and the day supply for each fill of the inde x 
medication. For patients thatreceive both infused andsubcutaneous (SC)
versions of medications, a presumed dayssupply will be attributed to each
infusion claim based on the product label Table 2.  Patients with early refills will 
be allowed to stockpile medications up to
amaximum of 14 day stotal forlater 
use.
For rituximab, because of the dos ing schedule PDC is not easily
 interpretable and 
may not be relevant. For purposes of inc lusion, if there are 3 or more rituximab
administrations, the patient will be considered adherent.
csDMARD adherence/addition. Adherence with or addition of a csDMARD during 
the 12 month follow -upwillbe identified.
Combination therapy patients .  For patients who initiate combination therap y
wit
hcsDMARDs a single measure of adherence will be created usi ng all claims
for csDMARDs during the 12 -month follow -up period. Adherence will be
calculated as the total day suppl ydivided by the number of day sfrom the first
claim during thefollow -
up until the end of the follow -up.
Monotherapy patients. For those who initiated monotherapy ,addition of a
csDMARD willbeevaluated
.
8.6.4. M edication Ef fectiveness
Among p atients with at least one yearof follow up, medica tion effectiveness at one year after
theindex date will be determined using the following six cri teria.4,5  Foreach of the 
6criteria, a 0/1 flag will be created. Patients who are effec tively treated for each of the 
6criteria will be considered effectivel y treated. Patients who fail any of the 6 criteria are

PFIZER CONFIDENTI AL
Page 18therefore not effe ctivel y treated. S ome of the 6 criter iacannot be measured for all of the
index medicati ons. For example, adhere nce cannot be c alculated for patients treated with
rituximab; therefore, medication effectiveness will not be calculated for patients treated with
rituximab at i ndex.
High adherenc e to index agent will be determined based on PDC > =0.8 during the 
12month follow -up perio
d. (Sensitivity  anal ysis will be conducted to determine the 
effect of different adherence threshholds, e g, 0.7, 0.9).
No increase in dose for in dex medication compared to t he starting dose. Dose
escalation will be identified per the criteria listed in Table 2.
No switching from the index medication to a (diffe rent) bDMARD or t ofacitinib. A 
switch will be defined as use of a different bDMARD or tofacitinib an y tim e during
the follow- up period.
No adding ofa new cs DMARD to the index therapy .Adding a new bDMARD will 
be considered as having at least 1 claim for any csDMARDs during follow -up and not 
having aclaim f or the s
ame csDMARD during the baseline. Changing from
1csDMARD at baseline to a different csDMARD at follow-up will be considered as 
adding a new csDMARD, ie,failing the algorithm.  (That is, a ny csDMARD present 
during the 1-year post -index and not pr esent dur ing 1 -year pre- index results in the 
patient not meeting csDMARD effectiveness crit erion).
Oral glucocorticoids. Only
National Drug Code (NDC) codes fororalglucocorticoids
will be included:
For patients with no claims for oral glucocorticoid p rescripti ons in the six months
prior to the index d ate:cannot receive 
more than 30 days oforal glucocorticoids
between ( index date + 91) to (inde x date + 365).   30daysof oral glucocorticoids
will be determined bysumming up the day suppl yof all glucoc orticoids claims
with afilldate between (index date+
91)to(index date +365).
For pat ients with claims for oral gluc ocorticoids during the six months prior to the 
index date: No increase in oral glucocorticoid dose during months 6-12 after index 
comp ared to t he 6months before the index date. Increa
se in oral glucocorticoids 
will b e deter mine d from the prednisone equiv alent dose for all glucocorticoid 
claims filled during the respective time periods.
At most one parenteral orintra-articular glucoco rticoid j oint injection on unique 
daysafter the pa tient had been on bDMARD treatmen t for m ore than three 
months between (index date +91) to (index date +365).
NOTE: 
Patients having more than one glucocorticoid injec tion code on a single 
day are consi dered to ha ve failed to meet the glucocorticoid injec tion criteria.

Page 218.6.5. Health Care Cost and Util ization
All cost and utilization measures will be identified in the 12-month pre-index period an d the
12-month post-index period.  Claims occurring on the index date will be considered partof
thepost-index period.   Baseline and follow - upcosts and the change in 12-month costs from
baseline to follow
-upwill then be examined.  Cost measures will comprise the total amount
paid by the health plan and patient.
Health care resource utilization -Health care resource utilization will be calculated
for ambulatory visits (office and outpatient), emergency department (ED) visits, and 
inpatient admissi ons.
RA-related resource health care utilization -Health care resource utilization related
to RA will be calculated for ambulatory visits, emergency room ( ER) visits, an d
inpatient admissions. Utilization willbedefined asRA-related if the claim had a
diagnosis fo r RA in anyposition and/or is for the administration of a bDMARD or 
csDMARD.
Health care costs -Health care costs will be computed as the combined health plan
and patient paid amounts. Costs will be calculated as total costs, pharmacy costs, and
medical c osts. See figure below.  ( Medical costs may be further broken down into
ambulatory costs, emergency services costs, inpatient costs, and other costs )
.
Costs will be adjusted using the annual medical care component of the Consumer 
Price Index (CP I) to refl ect inflation between 201 6(the earliest start of the pre-index
period) and 2018 (the cost of claims occurrin gin 201 9will not be adjusted).6See 
Annex 5.
Costs from other payers are o f importance for older patients duall yeligible for 
commercial and Medicare coverage. Payments from Medicare (and other payers) will
be
estimated based on coordination of benefits inform ation obtained by the health 
plan in its usual course of bu siness. This study will incorporate the amounts 
estimated to be paid b yother payers foratotal paid orallowable amount .7
RA-related health care cos ts-CPI-andcoordination ofbenefits (COB) -adjusted 
RA-relatedhealth care costs will be calculated a s total costs related to RA (treatment
and other medical claims with a diagnosis of RA). RA-related treatment costs will
include the cost of tofacitinib, bDMARD s, csDMARDs, and administration of
intravenous (I V) bDMARDs (CPT =96413 or 96415).
Medical cost s
will include all utilization with a diagnosis of RA and are also not 
treatment claims. Medical costs will comprise: inpatient costs, ambulatory costs, 
emergency services costs, administration, and other costs.

8.7. D ata Sources
8.7.1. Truven
The Truven Health MarketScan Research Databases reflects the combined healthcare service
use of individuals covered b yTruven H ealth clients (including employ ers, health plans, and
hospitals) nationwide. Truven Health builds databases comprise the healthcare experience of
the clients’ covered populations, as well as information about the populations themselves and 
the providers t hat serve them.  MarketScan Rese arch Databases provide detailed cost, 
utilization, and outcomes data for healthcare services performed in both inpatient and
outpatient settings. Inthe cla imsdatabases, the medical services are linked to outpati ent
prescr iption drug claims and person- level enrollment data using unique enrollee identifiers. 
The MarketScan Commercial Database contains thehealthcare experience ofprivatel y
insured individuals.  Cov erage is provided under a variet y offee-for-servi ce,fully capitated,
and partiall y capitat edhealth plans, including preferred provider organizations, point of
service plans, indemnit y plans, and health maintenance organizations.
Thedata that make up t heCommercial Database arestored inthefollowing tables:
T
he Inpatient Admissions Table contains records that summarize information about a
hospital admission. Truven Health constructs this table after identify ingall of the 
service records associ ated withanadmission (eg, the hospital claims, phy sician
claims, surgeon claims, andclaims from independent labs). Similar information 
(such as payments for professional services) is then summed across the claims. The
admission record includes t he pri ncipal procedure and diagnosis, Major Diagnostic 
Categor y, and Dia gnosis -Related Group. It also i ncludes all diagnoses and procedures 
(up to 14 each) found on the service records.
The Inpatient Services Table contains the individual claims that are summed to cre ate 
the inpatient admission records. An admissio n identifi er on both the Inpatient
Admissi ons and the Inpatient Services Tables identifies the claims that make up each
admission record.
The Outpatient Se rvices Table comprises services that were rend ered in adoctor’s
office, hospital outpatient facility ,or other outpatient facility .
The Facili ty Header Table contains the header records from facility claims for
inpatient andoutpatient services, including full diagnosis information.

Page 24The Outpatient Pharmaceu tical Claims Table contains outpatient prescript ion drug
data from multiple sources, inclu ding mail-order data. Each record includes National
Drug Code (NDC), therapeutic class, ingredient cost, dispensi ng fee, copayment,
deductible, total gross payment, and other data elements.
The RED BOOK™Supplement contains RED BOOK variables that en hance
prescription drug anal yses.  These variables are linked to the Outpatient
Pharmaceutical Claims Table byNDC.
The Annual Enrollment Summary Table provide s asingle record per year for each
enrollee, showing enrollm entstart and
enddates and, forsome demographic 
variables, the most prevalent demographic and plan information; for other variables,
monthly values are included.
The Enrollment Detail Table provides a single record per month of enrollment for 
each enrollee, with detailed demographic inform ation.
The Population Aggregate Table provides average counts of the covered (insured)
population to use fo r rate -supported analy sis.  The counts arerecorded byseveral
demographic variables (eg, age group, gender, region,etc.).
The MarketScan Medicare S
upplemental Database contains the healthcare experience 
of individuals with Medicare supplemental insuran ce paid for byemploy ers. Both the
Medicare -covered portio n of payment (represented as Coordination of Benefits 
Amount, or COB) and the employ er-paid portion are included in this database. The
tables that make upthe Medicare Supplemental Database are the same as those that 
make up the Commercial Database .
Claims are not included in the database until they have been adjudicate d; there is a lag of 
appro ximately  six months after the close of acalendar year or aquarter between services
provided andtheir inclusion intheResearch Databases. However, the Ear lyView Database 
has a 90- daylag that includes paid amounts f or 100 percent ofprescription drugs ,
approximately 85percent of physician office visits, and a pproximately 70percent of hospital
claims.
The MarketScan Early View Database includes all of th e compon ents found in the standard 
MarketScan Commercial and M edicare Supplemental Databases. Itincludes standardized
inpatient,
outpatient, pharmaceutical, andhealth -plan enrollment data. TheMarketScan
EarlyView Database captures healthcare services incurred up to 90 daysbeforedata release 
and includes only adjudicate d claims. However, the me dical component of care for some 
patients will not be complete, since some claims (particularly  inpatient claims) take longer to 
be adjudicated. Because this study isexamining only comorbidities prior to and treatments
during or prior to tofacitinib initiation fully adjudicated claims are not required and all 
available data will be used including Commercial, Medicare Supplemental, and Earl yView

8.13. Limitations of the Researc h Methods
8.13.1. Claims
Limitations that are general to claims database analy sesand specific to this study should be
noted. First, diagnosis of autoimmune conditions will be identified using ICD
-10-CM
diagnosis codes, whic
haresubje cttopotential miscoding. Second, the baseline period for
this study will be 12 months long.  Therefore, patients treated with abDMARD inthe
baseline canbeconsidered tobecontinuing users ofbDMARD therap y;however, patients 
with no bDMA RDuse in the baseline may have just been off therap y for the 12 months prior. 
Lastl y,this study will include an examination of me dication effectiveness at 1yearamong all
bDMARD users. Effectiveness will be measured using a validated algorithm; howeve r, the
algorithm wasnotvalidatedforallmedications being included. Specificall y, tofacitinib was

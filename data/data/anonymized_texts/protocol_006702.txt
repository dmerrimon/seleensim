Protocol PRO00047510 Rev. 1.0 
Confidential and Proprietary to Phase Diagnostics, Inc  5 of 13  BACKGROUND / RATIONALE Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as MERS and SARS-CoV. A novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was discovered in December 2019 and has resulted in millions of confirmed human infections worldwide1. COVID-19, the disease brought on by the virus, produces symptoms in infected patients that are similar to the other viral respiratory diseases including fever, cough, and shortness of breath2. The median incubation time is estimated to be approximately 5 days with symptoms estimated to be present within 12 days of infection3. As the number of SARS-CoV-2 infections continues to increase, there is growing demand for diagnostic tests that can produce rapid, accurate and accessible results.  To help address this need, the goal of the project is to develop a low-cost, non-invasive rapid point-of-care diagnostic test for the qualitative detection of SARS-CoV-2 in respiratory specimens. Current methodology for detecting SARS-CoV-2 is a molecular-based test that utilizes RT-PCR. This is a laborious process that requires expensive equipment and reagents, special training, and can take hours until test results are available. The PHASE Diagnostics rapid test is a qualitative lateral-flow immunoassay to determine the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in respiratory samples in a single hand-held device, with a time-to-result of 15 minutes. PRODUCT DESCRIPTION AND INTENDED USE  The INDICAID Rapid Antigen Test Kit includes 25 individually sealed single-use Test Devices, 25 Buffer Solution Vials, and 25 sterile Nasal Swabs.  A Quick Reference Instruction Sheet is provided with each test kit.  The INDICAID COVID-19 Rapid Antigen Test (INDICAID Rapid Test) is a lateral flow immunoassay (LFA) intended for the qualitative detection of nucleocapsid protein antigen from SARS-CoV-2 in direct nasal swabs from individuals suspected of COVID-19 by their healthcare provider within the first 7 days of symptom onset.   In the USA, testing is limited to laboratories certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA), 42 U.S.C. §263a, that meet the requirements to perform moderate, high, or waived complexity tests. The INDICAID Rapid Test)is intended for use at the Point of Care (POC), i.e., in patient care settings operating under a CLIA Certificate of Waiver, Certificate of Compliance, or Certificate of Accreditation.  The test is intended for use by medical professionals or trained personnel specifically instructed and trained in the techniques of in vitro diagnostic procedures and proper infection control procedures, and individuals similarly trained in point of care settings but who are not laboratory professionals.    
Protocol PRO00047510 Rev. 1.0 
Confidential and Proprietary to Phase Diagnostics, Inc  6 of 13  Positive results are for the identification of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid antigen. This antigen is generally detectable in upper respiratory samples during the acute phase of infection. Positive results indicate the presence of viral antigens, but clinical correlation with patient history and other diagnostic information is necessary to determine infection status. Positive results do not rule out bacterial infection or co-infection with other viruses. The agent detected may not be the definite cause of disease. Laboratories within the United States and its territories are required to report all positive results to the appropriate public health authorities.   Negative results should be treated as presumptive, do not rule out SARS-CoV-2 infection and should not be used as the sole basis for treatment or patient management decisions, including infection control decisions. Negative results should be considered in the context of a patient’s recent exposures, history and the presence of clinical signs and symptoms consistent with COVID-19, and confirmed with a molecular assay, if necessary, for patient management.    PRINCIPLE OF TEST The INDICAID Rapid Test is a chromatographic rapid test (approximately 20 minutes) that uses a sandwich immunoassay design to directly and qualitatively detect the presence or absence of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein. The results of the test are visually interpreted.  After collecting the swab, the patient’s sample is placed in the Buffer Solution Vial containing an extraction buffer. The sample is dispensed into the sample well of the test device and migrates through the test strip that contains antibodies conjugated to a chromophore (detector particle). This antibody-chromophore conjugate will bind to the nucleocapsid protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus if present in the sample. The sample continues to flow through the test strip and is trapped by capture antibodies, which can be visually observed by the presence of the test line (“T”). STUDY OVERVIEW The purpose of this study is to evaluate the clinical performance of the INDICAID Rapid Test. This will be established by determining the positive percent agreement (PPA), negative percent agreement (NPA), and overall percent agreement (OPA) between the results of the test under investigation and an EUA-approved RT-PCR test, using clinical samples collected from COVID-19 symptomatic individuals. A minimum of 30 RT-PCR SARS-CoV-2 positive and 30 negative patients are required to assess the clinical performance. STUDY OBJECTIVE The objective of this study is to assess the clinical performance of the INDICAID Rapid Test device in the hands of the intended user at the point-of-care (POC) setting.

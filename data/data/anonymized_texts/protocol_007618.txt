DOCUMENT HISTORY  
 
Document  Date of Issue Overall Rationale 
Amendment 03 17-Apr-2023 Protocol amended to widen the allowable range of body 
mass index (BMI) in the inclusion criterion to facilitate 
recruitment of participants with end stage renal disease (ESRD). 
Amendment 02 24-Nov-2022 Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp. underwent an entity name 
and address change to Merck Sharp & Dohme LLC, Rahway, NJ, USA. This conversion resulted only in an 
entity name change and update to the address. 
Updates were also made to the statistical analysis language. 
Amendment 01 23-Nov-2021 Protocol amended per regulatory agency request to add the 
exclusion of UGT2B17 and CYP2C19 dual poor 
metabolizers.

PROTOCOL AMENDMENT SUMMARY OF CHANGES  
Amendment : 03 
Overall Rationale for the Amendment :  
The upper limit of the BMI is being increased from 40 to 46 kg/m2. This increase in the upper limit of the BMI is to facilitate 
recruitment. Based on review of the site database of eligible participants, the Sponsor was inform ed that many of the ESRD patients 
have BMIs that exceed 40  kg/m2. The upper limit of the BMI for the Sponsor clinical database for MK-6482, that includes adult 
patients with von Hippel- Lindau (VHL) who require therapy for associated renal cell carcinoma (R CC), is 52 kg/m2. Therefore, the 
Sponsor has clinical experience with the use of MK -6482 in patients with BMIs exceeding 40 kg/m2. Based on a population 
pharmacokinetic ( PK) model, body weight (which is highly correlated with BMI) does not have a clinically meaningful effect on the 
PK of MK-6482. 
Related sections within the protocol were updated to reflect this change, as noted in chronological order below. 
Summary of Changes Table : 
Section # and Name  Description of Change Brief Rationale  
5.1.1 Inclusion Criteria 
for Participants With Healthy Renal Function The BMI upper limit in criterion #3 was increased.  
from: Have a BMI 18.0 -40.0 kg/m
2, inclusive, at 
prestudy (screening). See Section 8.3.1 for criteria on rounding to the nearest whole number. BMI = weight (kg)/height (m)
2. BMI must be 
within ± 20% of the mean BMI in the ESRD 
group. 
to: Have a BMI 18.0-46.0 kg/m2, inclusive, at 
prestudy (screening). See Section 8.3.1 for criteria 
on rounding to the nearest whole number. 
BMI = weight (kg)/height (m)2. BMI must be Inclusion criterion for BMI widened to facilitate recruitment of participants with ESRD . As the 
participants with healthy renal function are 
required to match the demographics of the 
participants with ESRD, the BMI of the healthy participants  was also widened .

from: To address the primary estimation objective 
and compare participants with ESRD before and 
after HD to participants with normal renal function, a two sided 90% CI for the difference in 
means (ESRD before HD – normal renal function, 
ESRD after HD – normal renal function) will be 
calculated for each PK parameter using the mean 
square error from the model a nd referencing a 
t-distribution . 
to: To address the primary estimation objective 
and compare participants with ESRD before and after HD to participants with normal renal 
function, a two sided 90% CI for the difference in 
least-squares means (ESRD before HD – normal 
renal function, ESRD after HD – normal renal function) will be calculated for each PK parameter using the aforementioned model.

2 INTRODUCTION  
MK-6482 (belzutifan) is a potent oral small molecule inhibitor of HIF -2α, that is indicated 
for the treatment of adult patients with VHL -RCC, CNS hemangioblastomas, or pancreatic 
neuroendocrine tumors not requiring immediate surgery. MK -6482 is also being evaluated as 
a treatment option for patients with solid tumor and patients with advanced RCC. HIF -2α is a 
transcription factor that is overexpressed in many cancers and promotes tumorigenesis. 
HIF-2α forms a heterodimeric com plex with HIF -1β (also called ARNT), and subsequently 
binds to hypoxic response elements of target genes which regulate hypoxic signaling, tumor 
cell growth and survival. MK-6482 binds to HIF-2α, preventing its heterodimerization with HIF-1β, and resulting in decreased transcription and expression of HIF-2α target genes. The 
proposed therapeutic dose of MK -6482 is 120 mg once daily. 
2.1 Study Rationale  
The purpose of this study is to determine the impact of markedly impaired renal function on the single -dose PK of MK-6482. 
In vitro, MK-6482 is a substrate of UGT2B17, CYP2C19 and CYP3A4. Both UGT2B17 and 
CYP2C19 are polymorphic enzymes and the relative contribution of these 2 enzymes to the elimination of MK -6482 has been elucidated by multiple approaches. The collective results 
of these analyses indicate that UGT2B17 is the major route of elimination in individuals who express this enzyme, while CYP2C19 is also a relevant clearance pathway. The overall contribution of CYP3A4 to MK-6482 metabolism is anticipated to be minor in individuals 
with intact UGT2B17 and CYP2C19 enzyme activity. A human ADME study (MK-6482-
008) is currently ongoing, and is anticipated to confirm that hepatic metabolism represents a 
major elimination pathway (>20% of the absorbed drug) for MK-6482. 
Renal excretion is not anticipated to represent a major clearance route for MK -6482. 
However, impaired renal function has been demonstrated to alter drug metabolism and 
transport pathways in the liver and gut, and these effects are more prominent i n patients with 
severely impaired renal function  (Dreisbach,  2009). As an example, CYP2C19 activity was 
reported to be reduced by 25% in patients with chronic renal impairment characterized by a GFR <50 mL/min ( Dreisbach,  2009). There are no published reports on the impact of renal 
impairment on UGT2B17 activity. Furthermore, since nephron-sparing surgery is often the treatment of choice for amenable RCC lesions, VHL -RCC patients may undergo multiple 
sequential renal surgeries, which can  lead to progressive worsening of renal function. In a 
retrospective analysis of 72 VHL patients with a median follow -up period of 61.5 months, 
30% of patients who underwent RCC surgery developed chronic kidney disease while 5% of patients developed ESRD and required HD (Kwon et al., 2014).

2.2.1 Pharmaceutical and Therapeutic  Background 
MK-6482 is a pote nt and selective inhibitor of HIF -2α both in vitro  and in vivo . HIF-2α is 
known to form a heterodimeric complex with HIF-1β, which is also referred to as ARNT; the 
heterodimer can then bind to hypoxic response elements in target genes and induce their transcription. The PAS domains of HIF are essential for heterodimerization of the HIF-2α:HIF-1β subunits, a prerequisite for target gene induction. A unique ligand-binding 
pocket has been identified in the PAS-B domain of HIF-2α ( Scheuermann et al.,  2013). 
MK-6482 binds in this pocket, thereby disrupting HIF-2α:ARNT heterodimerization and 
directly inhibiting the function of HIF-2α. 
In tumor cells in which HIF -2α is activated, MK-6482 blocks the transcription of several 
genes involved in oncogenesis, including cyclin D1, VEGF- A, and the glucose transporter 
SLC2A1. MK -6482 has showed antitumor activity in mouse VHL-deficient tumor xenograft 
models with nearly complete regression of established  tumors after oral administration of 
MK-6482 at 0.3 mg/kg bid. No activity was observed with MK -6482 treatment in 
VHL-proficient ccRCC tumors. MK-6482 showed no off- target activity against a panel of 
76 receptors and 8  ion channels (at concentrations up to 12.5 µM), and no off- target activity 
at 10 µM against a panel of 40  protein kinases and 2 protein phosphatases. 
2.2.2 Preclinical and Clinical Studies 
2.2.2.1 Preclinical Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism  
MK-6482 PK was evaluated in mice, rats, dogs, and monkeys. MK-6482 has low aqueous 
solubility and high permeability (BCS Class 2) and is well absorbed following oral 
administration in animals at clinically relevant doses. The oral bioavailability of MK -6482 
was shown to be high in mice (approximately 100%), moderate in dogs and monkeys (33% and 53%, respectively), and low in rats (18%). The in vitro plasma protein binding of MK‑6482 ranged from 45 to 61% across species (45% in human plasma). 
Following an oral dose of [
14C]MK-6482 in rats, radioactivity distributed rapidly  to most 
tissues and was reversible. The mean overall recovery of dose ranged from 93.9% to 97.1%. 
Biliary excretion accounted for 85% and 80.2% of the radioactive dose in bile-duct cannulated male  and female rats, respectively.  
In vitro and in vivo metabolism studies for MK -6482 revealed primarily oxidation and 
O-glucuronidation biotransformation pathways. The oxidation biotransformation pathways were greatest in rats, and similar between humans and dogs. PT3317, the primary metabolite 
of MK-6482 found in dog and monkey plasma samples, was confirmed by chemical 
synthesis to be a glucuronide. UGT reaction phenotyping with recombinant UGTs was used 
to determine that PT3317 formation is mediated by UGT2B17, which is mainly expressed in the small intestine. Imp ortantly, PT3317 has no activity against HIF -2α.

Urinary excretion was found to be a minor pathway for elimination of MK-6482 (≤4% of 
dose) and PT3317 (≤13% of dose) for rats, dogs, and monkeys.

the Sponsor. The IB should be reviewed in conjunction with this study protocol. 
2.2.2.2 Preclinical Toxicology  
MK-6482 was not genotoxic in the in vitro bacterial mutagenicity assay (Ames), nor in the 
in vitro micronucleus assay, indicating a low genotoxic risk from MK-6482 exposure. 
The in vivo safety pharmacology assessments of the cardiovascular, central nervous, and 
respiratory systems included in general toxicology studies did not yield any adverse findings. 
The cardiovascular  system was assessed by hemodynamic and electrocardiographic 
parameters in the GLP 28 -day and 13- week repeat -dose toxicity studies in dogs, and no 
change from baseline was observed with MK -6482 treatment. 
The toxicity of orally administered MK -6482 was eva luated in 28 -day and 13- week repeat 
dose GLP studies in rats and dogs. Effects on the RBC compartment were observed 
consistently in both species, where RBC count, HGB, and HCT levels were decreased by 
approximately 30 to 50 % at all doses. The effects on the RBC compartment were reversed once MK-6482 administration stopped and are considered an “on- target” pharmacologic 
activity of HIF -2α antagonism on EPO production. 
In the rat toxicity studies with MK -6482, off- target organ toxicity was identified in the  male 
reproductive system. The MK- 6482 related effects involved testes (smaller/soft testes and 
decreased weight associated with hypo -spermatogenesis, germ cell degeneration and 
multinucleated giant cells), and epididymis (oligospermia), and were not rever sible within 
26-week recovery periods. These findings were associated with decreased sperm motility and 
sperm counts, and increased number of abnormal sperms in the sperm analysis. No effects on 
sperm evaluation and histopathology of testes/epididymides were observed in male dogs. No 
effects on the female reproductive organs were observed in either rats or dogs.  
In a preliminary embryofetal toxicity study where pregnant rats were administered MK -6482, 
a significant level of post implantation loss indicative  of embryofetal lethality and/or reduced 
fetal body weight, reduced ossification, and malformations in surviving fetuses was observed at an exposure close to the clinically relevant exposure at 120 mg/day.  
A summary of MK -6482 nonclinical toxicology is contained in the IB supplied by the 
Sponsor. The IB should be reviewed in conjunction with this study protocol.

2.2.2.3 Clinical Studies  
As of a cutoff date of 15- JUN-2021, MK -6482 has been administered as single or multiple 
doses to a total of 135 healthy participants. In addition, MK -6482 is being evaluated as 
monotherapy or in combination with other anticancer treatments in participants with solid 
tumors.  
Based on the overall integrated safety summary of MK -6482 monotherapy (N=181) across 
MK-6482-001 and MK-6482-004 studies, the adverse drug reactions identified for MK-6482 
include anemia due to decreased EPO, fatigue, nausea, dyspnea, hypoxia, and dizziness. 
Most anemia events were ≤Grade 2. Anemia is an on- target effect of MK -6482 because of 
the impact of HIF on EPO expression and reduction in EPO and HGB levels with MK-6482 
administration. Anemia has been medically managed with erythropoiesis stimulating agent administration and/or blood transfusion as indicated  and dose interruption/reduction. 
Hypoxia is manage d by oxygen supplementation as indicated and dose 
interruption/reduction. Anemia due to decreased EPO and hypoxia should be closely monitored and medically managed as indicated. 
Single MK-6482 doses up to 200 mg have been evaluated in 4 completed single-dose Phase 1 
studies in healthy participants, and multiple daily doses up to 7 days of 120 mg have been administered to healthy participants in the completed  midazolam DDI study (MK-6482-009). 
MK-6482 was generally well tolerated in these studies. All reported AEs were categorized as 
either mild or moderate in intensity. In healthy participant studies, there have been no SAEs and no discontinuations due to AEs attributed to MK-6482 treatment. There have been no reports of anemia, hypoxia, or fatigue in the completed healthy participant studies. In 
addition, no clinically significant reductions in HGB or HCT have occurred in healthy 
participants in the 4 completed single-dose Phase 1 studies. Mean red uctions in HGB and 
HCT of about 12% from baseline were observ ed in the completed mi dazolam DDI study 
(MK-6482-009) after multiple daily doses of 120 mg, consistent with the anticipated 
on-target effect of EPO suppression for MK-6482. 
A summary of the MK -6482 clinical development program is contained in the IB supplied by 
the Sponsor. The IB should be reviewed in conjunction with this study protocol. 
2.2.3 Ongoing Clinical Studies  
There are 14 ongoing clinical studies with MK-6482 which include: 5 Phase 1 studies, 
1 Phase 1 b/2 study, 5 Phase 2 studies, and 3 Phase 3 studies. The Phase 1 studies include an 
assessment of safety, tolerability, PK, pharmacodynamic properties, and anti- tumor activity 
of MK-6482 in participants with advanced solid tumors (MK-6482- 001); investigation of 
absorption, metabolism, excretion, and mass balance of MK -6482 in healthy participants 
(MK-6482-008); evaluation of MK-6482 as monotherapy and in combination with lenvatinib 
with or without pembrolizumab in China participants with advanced RCC (MK-6482-010); evaluation of safety and tolerabili ty of MK-6482 in participants with advanced ccRCC

(MK-6482-018); and evaluation of the impact of crystalline drug substance on MK-6482 PK 
in healthy participants (MK -6482-019). The Phase 1b/2 study is an evaluation of immune and 
targeted combination therapies in participants with RCC (MK -3475-U03). The Phase 2 
studies include an evaluation of efficacy and safety of MK -6482 in patients with VHL- RCC 
an evaluation of efficacy and safety of MK -6482 in combination with cabozantinib in adult 
participants with adv anced ccRCC (MK -6482-003); evaluation of efficacy and safety of 
MK-6482 in patients with VHL- RCC (MK-6482-004); evaluation of efficacy and safety of 
MK-6482 in patients with advanced RCC (MK-6482-013); evaluation of efficacy and safety 
of MK-6482 monothera py in participants with advanced pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma 
or pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor (MK-6482-015); and evaluation of efficacy and safety of 
pembrolizumab plus lenvatinib in combination with MK-6482 in multiple solid tumors (MK-6482-016). The ongoing Phase 3 studies include an evaluation of the efficacy and 
safety of MK -6482 in patients with advanced RCC (MK-6482-005); evaluation of MK-6482 
in combination with lenvatinib versus cabozantinib in participants with advanced RCC (MK-6482-011); and an evaluation of the efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab in 
combination with MK-6482 and lenvatinib, versus pembrolizumab and lenvatinib in participants with advanced ccRCC (MK -6482-012). In the ongoing trials, MK-6482 appears 
to have a tolerable and manageable safety profile with low numbers of discontinuations due to an AE and most AEs being mild to moderate in severity.   
One case of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome resulting in death was reported in 
MK-6482-005 for a participant with advanced RCC, who received MK -6482 120 mg daily 
for approximately 2 weeks. The participant was also reported as experiencing disseminated intravascular coagulation, hepatic failure, hypocalcemia and sepsis. T he Sponsor considers 
that there is no conclusive evidence to support a causal relationship between MK-6482 and 
the aforementioned events since there were several confounding factors in the causality 
assessment reported for these AEs, including but not limited to prior/concomitant 
medications,  and possible concurrent illnesses. However, the 
Sponsor cannot definitively exclude the possibility of a causal  relationship between MK-
6482 treatment and the reported events . Of note, more than 600 participants with solid 
tumors/advanced RCC have received MK-6482 as monotherapy or in combination with other 
anticancer treatments and no other case of multiple organ failure has been reported. The 
Sponsor will continue to monitor the safety profile of MK -6482 in the clinical program . 
2.3 Benefit/Risk Assessment  
Participants in clinical studies will not receive direct benefit from treatment during 
participation as clinical studies are designed to provide information about the safety and properties of an investigational medicine. An indirect health benefit to the pa rticipants 
enrolled in this study is the free medical tests received at the prestudy (screening) visit  and 
during the study. 
Additional details regarding specific benefits and risks for participants participating in this 
clinical study may be found in the accompanying IB and informed consent documents.

4 STUDY DESIGN 
4.1 Overall Design 
This is a nonrandomized, parallel-group, single- site, open -label study of MK -6482 in 
participants with ESRD and healthy matched control participants.  
Screening of participants will occur within 28  days prior to first study intervention 
administration . 
A total of approximately 12 adult male (vasectomized  or surgically sterilized ) and female 
(nonchildbearing potential only) participants will be enrolled: 6 participants with ESRD and 
6 healthy matched control participants with normal renal function.

Assignment to renal function group will be as follows: 
Group N eGFR (mL/min/1.73m2) 
ESRD 6 a Require dialysis 
Healthy matched control 6 a ≥ 90 b 
a. At least 2 UGT2B17 IM s and at least 2 EM s will be enrolled per group.  
b. The eGFR based on the MDRD equation will be calculated at screening. Baseline eGFR will be 
assessed during the screening period  for study eligibility. If a repeat measurement is obtained, the 
mean of the two values will be used to assess study eligibility.  At the discretion of the 
investigator, a measured CLcr as determined by a 24 -hour urine collection may be used to 
determine eligibility for enrollment. Participants with an eGFR (using the MDRD equation) up to 
10% below 90  mL/min/1.73 m2 (ie, ≥81 mL/min/1.73 m2) may be eligible for the study if their 
measured CLcr (based on a 24 -hour urine collection) is ≥90 mL/min . 
Following enrollment of the ESRD group, the healthy control group will be enrolled. Each 
healthy control participant will be matched to the mean age (± 15 years), BMI (± 20%), sex (with a similar male/female ratio in each group), and UGT2B17 genotype (at least 2 IMs and 
2 EMs) of participants with ESRD. If a UGT2B17 PM ESRD participant is enrolled in the study, a UGT2B17 PM healthy matched control participant should be included in the control group. If after reasonable efforts, a UGT2B17 PM healthy matched control participant cannot 
be enrolled, an additional ESRD participant (ie, a 7
th ESRD participant), who is not 
UGT2B17 PM, will be enrolled. This additional ESRD participant should be matched to the 
mean age (± 15 years) and BMI (± 20%) of the other 6 ESRD participants. The final healthy 
matched control participant (ie, the 6th healthy control participant), who is also not UGT2B17 
PM, should also be matched to the mean age (± 15 years), BMI (± 20%), and sex (with a similar male/female ratio in each group) of the 6 ESRD participants (ie, not including the 7
th 
ESRD participant). 
ESRD participants will receive a single oral dose of 120 mg MK-6482 on 2 separate 
occasions. In Period 1, ESRD participants will receive a single oral dose o f 120 mg 
MK-6482 immediately following completion of their normally scheduled HD, followed by 
72 hours of blood sampling for PK assessment of MK-6482. For participants following a 
Monday, Wednesday, Friday HD schedule, MK -6482 will be administered immediately 
following their Friday HD session. For participants following a Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday 
HD schedule, study intervention will be administered immediately following their Saturday HD session. The participant’s next regularly scheduled HD session (either Monday or Tuesday) should initiate immediately following the 72-hour blood draw. If HD must be initiated before 72 hours postdose, a sample for MK- 6482 analysis will be collected prior to 
HD. There will be a washout period of at least 7 days between MK -6482 administrations  in 
each period .

In Period 2, ESRD participants will receive a single oral dose of 120 mg MK-6482 
approximately 2 hours prior to their normally scheduled HD followed by 72 hours blood 
sampling for PK assessment of MK -6482. For participants following a Monday, Wednesday, 
Friday HD schedule, MK -6482 will be administered approximately 2 hours prior to their 
Friday HD session. For participants following a Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday HD schedule, 
MK-6482 will be  administered approximately 2 hours prior to their Saturday HD session. 
The 4-hour HD session should initiate immediately following the 2-hour PK blood draw. A 
pre-dialyzer plasma sample will be collected at the start of HD. During this dialysis session, 
pre- and post- dialyzer plasma samples will be collected approximately every 30 minutes 
during HD for MK-6482 analysis.  
Healthy matched control participants will receive a single oral dose of 120 mg MK-6482, 
followed by 72 hours of blood sampling for PK ass essment of MK -6482. 
Safety will be monitored throughout the study. 
Because this is a Phase 1 assessment of MK -6482 in humans, the PK, pharmacodynamic, and 
safety profiles of the compound are still being elucidated. This protocol is therefore written 
with flexibility to accommodate the inherent dynamic nature of Phase 1 clinical studies. Refer to Section 8.11.6 for examples of modifications permitted within the protocol 
parameters.  
Specific procedures to be performed during the study, including prescribed times and associated visit windows, are outlined in Section  1.3 of the SoA. Details of each procedure 
are provided in Section  8. 
4.2 Scientific Rationale for Study Design 
The primary objective of this trial is to investigate the impact of markedly impaired renal function on MK -6482 PK. MK -6482 is anticipated to be eliminated predominantly by hepatic 
metabolism. Although renal excretion is not anticipated to represent a major clearance route for MK-6482, impaired renal function can alter drug metabolism and transport pathways in 
the liver and gut. Since these effects are more prominent in patients with  severely 
compromised renal function, this study will evaluate and compare MK -6482 PK in ESRD 
patients requiring HD  to healthy control participants with normal renal function that are 
reasonably matched to the mean demographic parameters of participants wi th ESRD to 
control for the influence of covariates. In addition, the impact of HD on MK-6482 PK will also be assessed.

4.2.1 Rationale for Endpoints 
4.2.1.1 Pharmacokinetic Endpoints  
The primary endpoints for this study will include the PK parameters of AUC0 -inf and Cmax 
of MK-6482. Plasma PK parameters included in this primary endpoint will be evaluated and 
compared between participants with ESRD before and after HD compared to participants 
with healthy renal function, using GMR and CI to assess differences between these two 
groups.  
The secondary endpoint of this study is to evaluate the extent of MK -6482 removal by HD 
from plasma  (CLD, plasma). The plasma parameter included in this secondary endpoint will be 
evaluated and compared between participants with ESRD before and after HD compared to 
participants with healthy renal function. 
4.2.1.2 Safety Endpoints  
Safety and tolerability of MK -6482 monotherapy has been studied in Phase 1 and Phase 2 
clinical studies. Overall, MK -6482 has a tolerable and manageable safety profile wit h low 
numbers of discontinuations due to an AE and most AEs being mild to moderate in severity. 
The most common adverse drug reactions identified based on the integrated aggregate safety 
assessment  in VHL-RCC and RCC patients  of all available information include: hypoxia, 
anemia, fatigue, dyspnea, and dizziness. Therefore, the standard safety monitoring of AEs , 
physical examinations, 12-lead ECGs, pulse oximetry, vital signs, clinical safety laboratory 
tests (hematology, serum  chemistry, and urinalysis), obtained throughout the study are 
appropriate to assess safety and tolerability of MK -6482 in this study. 
4.2.1.3 Planned Exploratory Biomarker Research  
4.2.1.3.1 Planned Genetic Analysis  
Genetic variation may impact a participant’s response to therapy, susceptibility to, severity, 
and progression of disease. Variable response to therapy may be due to genetic determinants that impact drug ADME; mechanism of action of the drug; disease etiology; and/or 
molecular subtype of the disease being treated. Therefore, where local regulations and IRB/IEC allow, a sample will be collected for DNA analysis from consenting participants.  
DNA samples may be used for research related to the study intervention(s), the disease under study, or related diseases. They  may also be used to develop tests/assays including diagnostic 
tests related to the disease under study, related diseases, and study intervention(s). Genetic research may consist of the analysis of 1 or more candidate genes, the analysis of genetic markers throughout the genome, or analysis of the entire genome. Analysis may be conducted if it is hypothesized that this may help further understand the clinical data.

PROTOCOL/AMENDMENT N O.:  021-03    
 
 
 
MK-6482-021-03 FINAL PROTOCOL  17-APR-2023 
 
 
 
The samples may be analyzed as part of a multistudy assessment of genetic factors involved 
in the response to understand study disease or related conditions. 
In addition to studying variation across the human genome, UGT2B17 and CYP2C19 
polymorphisms will be investigated specifically for their impact on MK -6482 PK and drug 
response. 
4.2.1.4 Future Biomedi cal Research  
The Sponsor will conduct FBR on DNA specimens for which consent was provided during this clinical study.  
Such research is for biomarker testing to address emergent questions not described elsewhere 
in the protocol and will only be conducted on specimens from appropriately consented 
participants. The objective of collecting/retaining specimens for FBR is to explore and 
identify biomarkers that inform the scientific understanding of diseases and/or their 
therapeutic treatments. The overarching goal is to use such information to develop safer, more effective drugs/vaccines, and/or to ensure participants receive the correct dose of the correct drug/vaccine at the correct  time. The details of FBR are presented in Appendix 6. 
4.3 Justification for Dose  
The proposed clinical dose for MK-6482 is 120 mg daily, which will be evaluated in this study. Single MK-6482 doses up to 200 mg, which was associated with a 1.6- fold increase in 
AUC compared to 120 mg, have been previously administered to healthy participants and were generally well tolerated. Furthermore, multiple daily doses of up to 240 mg daily and 120 mg twice daily have been administered to patients with advanced solid tumors.  
Renal impairment was not identified as a significant covariate based on a  population PK 
analysis using MK-6482 concentration data across multiple MK-6482 clinical studies, which 
was anticipated since renal clearance represents a minor elimination pathway for MK -6482 in 
humans. 
4.4 Beginning and End-of-Study Definition  
The overall s tudy begins when the first participant (or their legally acceptable representative) 
provides documented informed consent. The overall study ends when the last participant 
completes the last study -related contact, withdraws consent, or is lost to follow -up (ie, the 
participant is unable to be contacted by the investigator). 
A study may be paused during review of newly available preclinical/clinical safety, PK, 
pharmacodynamic, efficacy, or biologic data or other items of interest, prior to a final 
decision on continuation or termination of the study. It may be necessary to keep the study 
open for gathering/reviewing of additional supportive data to optimally complete the

objective(s) of the study. If necessary, the appropriate amendment(s) to the protocol and /or 
appropriate communication(s) will be generated. If the decision has been made to end the 
study following this review period, the study end will be defined as the date of the Sponsor 
decision, and this end of study date supersedes the definitions outlined above. The Competent Authority(ies) and IRB(s)/IEC(s) will be apprised of the maximum duration of the study beyond the last participant out and the justification for keeping the study open. 
4.4.1 Clinical Criteria for Early Study Termination  
There are no prespecified criteria for terminating the study early . 
5 STUDY POPULATION 
Vasectomized or surgically sterilized male participants and female participants of 
nonchildbearing potential between the ages of 18 and 75 years (inclusive) will be enrolled in 
this study.  
Participants with normal renal function will match to the mean demographic parameters of 
the ESRD group. Healthy control participants will be matched for the mean age (± 15 years), mean BMI (± 20%), sex ( with a similar male/female ratio in each group), and UGT2B17 
genotype (at least 2 IMs and 2 EMs)  of the ESRD group. If a UGT2B17 PM ESRD 
participant is enrolled in the study, a UGT2B17 PM healthy matched control participant should be included in the contro l group. If after reasonable efforts, a UGT2B17 PM healthy 
matched control participant cannot be enrolled, an additional ESRD participant (ie, a 7
th 
ESRD participant), who is not UGT2B17 PM, will be enrolled. This additional ESRD participant should be matched to the mean age (± 15 years) and BMI (± 20%) of the other 6 ESRD participants. The final healthy matched control participant (ie, the 6
th healthy control 
participant), who is also not UGT2B17 PM, should also be matched to the mean age (± 15 years), BMI  (± 20%), and sex (with a similar male/female ratio in each group) of the 
6 ESRD participants (ie, not including the 7
th ESRD participant). 
Prospective approval of protocol deviations to recruitment and enrollment criteria, also known as protocol waivers or exemptions, is not permitted.

All supplies indicated in Table 1 will be provided per the “Sourcing” column depending on 
local country operational requirements. If local sourcing, every attempt should be made to 
source these supplies from a single lot/batch  number where possible (eg, not applicable in the 
case where multiple lots or batches may be required due to the length of the study, etc). 
Refer to Section 8.1.9 for details regarding administration of the study intervention. 
6.2 Preparation/Handling/Storage/Accountability  
6.2.1 Dose Preparation  
There are no specific calculations or evaluations required to be performed to administer the 
proper dose to each participant. The rationale for selection of doses to be used in this study is 
in Section  4.3. 
6.2.2 Handling, Storage, and Ac countability  
The investigator or designee must confirm appropriate temperature conditions have been maintained during transit for all study intervention  received, and any discrepancies are 
reported and resolved before use of the study intervention . 
Only participants enrolled in the study may receive study intervention, and only authorized site staff may supply or administer study intervention. All study intervention s must be stored 
in a secure, environmentally controlled, and monitored (manual or aut omated) area in 
accordance with the labeled storage conditions with access limited to the investigator and authorized site staff.  
The investigator, institution, or the head of the medical institution (where applicable) is responsible for study intervention accountability, reconciliation, and record maintenance (ie, receipt, reconciliation, and final disposition records). 
For all study sites, the local country Sponsor personnel or designee will provide appropriate 
documentation that must be completed for drug accountability and return, or local discard and destruction if appropriate. Where local discard and destruction is appropriate, the 
investigator is responsible for ensuring that a local discard/destruction procedure is 
documented. 
The study site is respo nsible for recording the lot number, manufacturer, and expiry date for 
any locally purchased product (if applicable) as per local guidelines unless otherwise 
instructed by the Sponsor. The investigator shall take responsibility for and shall take all steps  to maintain appropriate 
records and ensure appropriate supply, storage, handling, distribution, and usage of study 
interventions in accordance with the protocol and any applicable laws and regulation s.

6.3 Measures to Minimize Bias: Randomization and Blinding  
6.3.1 Intervention Assignment   
Each participant will be assigned a unique identification number upon screening. Participants 
who complete the study screening assessments and meet all the eligibility criteria will be 
assigned a unique allocation number at the ti me of initial study intervention administration , 
different from the screening number, and will receive the study intervention. 
Participants will receive the treatment (s) as depicted in Table 2.

Healthy participants  6 120 mg MK -6482 Not applicable  
a There will be at least 7 days of washout between study intervention administration s in each 
period. 
 
6.3.2 Stratification  
No stratification based on age, sex, or other characteristics will be used in this study.  
6.3.3 Blinding 
This is an open -label study; therefore, the Sponsor, investigator, and participant will know 
the intervention administered.  
6.4 Study Intervention Compliance  
A qualified designee will be responsible for monitoring the administration of the timed oral 
doses. A mouth check will be performed by the qualified designee to ensure that the participants have swallowed the study intervention. Once a participant has finished the dosing water, the qualified designee will use a flashlight and a tongue depressor to check the participant’s mouth. Participants’ hands will also be verified to ensure that the study 
intervention was ingested. 
Interruptions from the protocol-specified treatment plan require consultation between the 
investigator and the Sponsor and written documentation of the collaborative decision on participant management.

and is able to withhold the use within 4 hours prior to initial administration of the study 
intervention. 
Any medication (including over- the-counter) that would significantly alter eGFR, which, by 
the determination of the i nvestigator, might interfere with the study (eg, cimetidine) must be 
discontinued at least 2 weeks (or 5 half -lives of the compound, whichever is longer) prior to 
initial administration of the study intervention .  
Phosphate binders containing aluminum, calcium, or lanthanum salts; iron supplements or other metal cations;H2 -receptor antagonists (H2RAs [except cimetidine]); or multivitam ins 
containing iron or zinc must be withheld at least 8 hours prior to each administration of the study intervention and at least 4 hours postdose. 
Concurrent use of any prescription or nonprescription medication, or concurrent vaccination, 
must first be discussed between the investigator and Sponsor before administration, unless 
appropriate medical care necessitates that therapy or vaccination should begin before the investigator and Sponsor can consult. The participant will be allowed to continue in the study if both the Sponsor and the investigator agree. 
Participants with Normal Renal Function Only  
If a participant does not discontinue all prior medications within 14 days or 5 half- lives of 
study intervention administration, they may be included in the study if the investigator can 
rationalize that the specific use of a prior medication is not clinically relevant within the context of the study. 
Concurrent use of any prescription or nonprescription medication, or concurrent vaccination, 
must first be dis cussed between the investigator and Sponsor before administration, unless 
appropriate medical care necessitates that therapy or vaccination should begin before the 
investigator and Sponsor can consult. The participant will be allowed to continue in the study if both the Sponsor and the investigator agree. 
All Participants

7 DISCONTINUATION OF STUDY INTERVENTION AND PARTICIPANT 
WITHDRAWAL  
7.1 Discontinuation of Study In tervention  
In clinical studies with a single intervention, discontinuation of study intervention can only occur before the intervention. Therefore, healthy matched control participants who receive a single-dose intervention cannot discontinue study intervention.  
For ESRD participants only:  
Discontinuation of study intervention does not represent withdrawal from the study. 
As certain data on clinical events beyond study intervention discontinuation may be 
important to the study, they must be collected through the participant’s last scheduled 
follow-up, even if the participant has discontinued study intervention. Therefore, all 
participants who discontinue study intervention before completion of the protocol- specified 
treatment period will still continue to participate in th e study as specified in Section 1.3 and 
Section 8.1.10, or if available, a PCL. 
Participants may discontinue study intervention at any time for any reason or be discontinued from the study intervention at the discretion of the investigator should any untoward effect occur. In addition, a participant may be discontinued from study intervention by the investigator or the Sponsor if study intervention is inappropriate, the study plan is violated, or for administrative and/or other safety reasons. Specific details regarding procedures to be performed at study intervention discontinuation are provided in Section  8.1.10. 
A participant must be discontinued from study intervention, but continue to be monitored in the study, for any of the following reasons: 
• The participant or participant’s legally acceptable representative requests to discontinue study intervention. 
• The participant has a medical conditi on or personal circumstance which, in the opinion of 
the investigator and/or Sponsor, placed the participant at unnecessary risk from continued administration of study intervention. 
• The participant has a positive drug screen at any time during the course of the study (with 
the exception for positive drug screen due to prescription drug use that is approved by the 
investigator and Sponsor) . The drug screen can be confirmed by a recheck at the 
discretion of the investigator after discussion with the Sponsor. 
7.2 Participant Withdrawal From the Study  
A participant must be withdrawn from the study if the participant or participant’s legally acceptable representative withdraws consent from the study.

PROTOCOL/AMENDMENT N O.:  021-03    
 
 
MK-6482-021-03 FINAL PROTOCOL  17-APR-2023 
 
 
If a participant withdraws from the  study, they will no longer receive study intervention or be 
followed at scheduled protocol visits. 
Specific details regarding procedures to be performed at the time of withdrawal from the 
study, as well as specific details regarding withdrawal from FBR, are outlined in 
Section 8.1.10. The procedures to be performed should a participant repeatedly fail to return 
for scheduled visits and/or if the study site is unable to contact the participant are outlined in Section 7.3. 
7.3 Lost to Follow-up 
If a participant fails to return to the clinic for a required study visit and/or if the site is unable 
to contact the participant, the following procedures are to be performed: 
• The site must attempt to contact the participant and reschedule the missed visit. If the 
participant is contacted, the participant should be counseled on the importance of 
maintaining the protocol -specified visit schedule.  
• The investigator or designee must make every effort to regain contact with the participant 
at each missed visit (eg, telephone calls and/or a certified letter to the participant’s last known mailing address or locally equivalent methods). These contact attempts should be documented in the participant’s medical record.  
• Note: A participant is not considered lost to follow -up until the last scheduled visit for the 
individual participant. The missing data for the participant will be managed via the prespecified statistical data handling an d analysis guidelines. 
8 STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES  
• Study procedures and their timing are summarized in the SoA.  
• Adherence to the study design requirements, including those specified in the SoA, is essential and required for study conduct. 
• The investigator is responsible for ensuring that procedures are conducted by 
appropriately qualified (by education, training, and experience) staff. Delegation of 
study-site personnel responsibilities will be docu mented in the Investigator Trial File 
Binder (or equivalent).  
• All study-related medical decisions must be made by an investigator who is a qualified 
physician. 
• All screening evaluations must be completed and reviewed to confirm that potential participants meet all eligibility criteria. The investigator will maintain a screening log to record details of all participants screened and to confirm eligibility or record reasons for screening failure, as applicable.

MK-6482-021-03 FINAL PROTOCOL  17-APR-2023 
 
 
• Procedures conducted as part of the participant’s routine clinical management (eg, blood 
count) and obtained before signing of ICF may be used for screening or baseline purposes 
provided the procedure met the protocol- specified criteria and were performed within the 
time frame defined in the SoA.  
• Additional evaluations/testing may be deemed necessary by the investigator and or the 
Sponsor for reasons related to participant safety. In some cases, such evaluation/testing 
may be potentially sensitive in nature (eg, HIV, hepatitis C), and thus local regulations 
may require that additional informed c onsent be obtained from the participant. In these 
cases, such evaluations/testing will be performed in accordance with those regulations. 
The maximum amount of blood collected from each ESRD participant and healthy 
participant over the duration of the study will not exceed 313.5  mL and 148 mL, respectively 
(Appendix 8 ). 
Repeat or unscheduled samples may be taken for safety reasons or for technical issues with the samples.  
8.1 Administrative and General Procedures 
8.1.1 Informed Consent  
The investigator or medically qualified designee (consistent with local requirements) must 
obtain documented informed consent from each potential participant (or their  legally 
acceptable representative) prior to participating in this clinical study or FBR . If there are 
changes to the participant’s status during the study (eg, health or age of majority requirements), the investigator or medically qualified designee must ensure the appropriate 
documented informed consent is in place.  
8.1.1.1 General Informed Consent  
Informed consent given by the participant or their  legally acceptable representative must be 
documented on a consent form. The form must include the study protocol number, study 
protocol title, dated signature, and agreement of the participant (or their legally acceptable 
representative ) and of the person conducting the consent discussion. 
A copy of the signed and dated ICF  should be given to the participant (or their legally 
acceptable representative)  before participation in the study. 
The initial ICF, any subsequent revised ICF, and any written information provided to the 
participant must receive the IRB/IEC’s approval/favorable opinion in advance of use. The 
participant or their legally acceptable representative should be informed in a timely manner if 
new information becomes available that may be relevant to the participant’s willingness to 
continue participation in the study. The communication of this information will be provided and documented via a revised consent form or addendum to the original consent form that 
captures the participant’s or the participant’s legally acceptable representative’s dated 
signature.

8.1.6.2 Concomitant Medications  
The investigator or qualified designee will record medication, if any, taken by the participant 
during the study. 
8.1.7 Assignment of Screening Number 
All consented participants will be given a unique screening number that will be used to 
identify the participant for all procedures that occur before intervention allocation . Each 
participant will be assigned only 1 screening number. Screening numbers must not be reused for different participants.  
Any participant who is screened multiple times will retain the original screening number assigned at the initial Screening Visit. Specific details on the screening/rescreeni ng visit 
requirements are in Section 8.11.1. 
8.1.8 Assignment of Treatment/ Allocation Number  
All eligible participants will be allocated , by nonrandom assignment, and will receive a 
treatment/allocation  number. The treatment/ allocation  number identifies the participant for 
all procedures occurring after treatment allocation. Once a treatment/ allocation  number is 
assigned to a participant, it can never be reassigned to anothe r participant.  
A single participant cannot be assigned more than 1 treatment/ allocation  number. 
8.1.9 Study Intervention Administration  
Administration of study intervention will be monitored by the investigator and/or study staff. 
The pharmacy at the CRU will provide each dose in individual unit dose containers for each 
participant  and for each study period (as applicable) , as per the allocation scheme.  
Participants will be instructed not to crush, split, or chew the study intervention.  
8.1.9.1 Timing of Dose Administr ation 
ESRD Participants  
On Day 1  of Period 1, 120 mg (3x40 mg tablets) MK-6482 will be administered at Hour 0, 
immediately following completion of their normally scheduled HD. On Day 1 of Period 2, 
120 mg (3x40 mg tablets) MK -6482 will be administered at Hour 0, approximately 2 hours 
prior to their normally scheduled HD.

All Participants  
The study intervention will be administered with 240  mL of water following at least a 
10-hour fast and participants will continue to fast for at least 4  hours postdose. See 
Section 5.3.1 for additional information on meal restrictions throug hout the study. 
The exact clock time of study intervention administration will be recorded. 
8.1.10 Discontinuation and Withdrawal  
The investigator or study coordinator must notify the Sponsor when a participant has been 
discontinued/withdrawn from the study and/or intervention. If a participant discontinues for 
any reason at any time during the course of the study and/or intervention, the participant may 
be asked to return to the clinic (or be contacted) for a poststudy visit as per the number of 
days described in  Section 8.11.4 to have the applicable procedures conducted. However, the 
investigator may decide to perform the poststudy procedures at the time of discontinuation or 
as soon as possible after discontinuatio n. If the poststudy visit occurs prior to the safety 
follow-up time frame as specified in Section 8.4.1, the investigator should perform a 
follow-up telephone call at the end of the follow-up period ( Section 8.4.1) to confirm if any 
AEs have occurred since the poststudy clinic visit. Any AEs that are present at the time of discontinuation/withdrawal should be followed in accordance with the safety requirements outlined in Section  8.4. 
8.1.10.1 Withdrawal From Future Biomedical Research  
Participants may withdraw their consent for FBR. Participants may withdraw consent at any 
time by contacting the study investigator. If medical records for the study are still available, the investigator will contact the Sponsor using the designated mailbox (clinical.s pecimen.management@ MSD.com). Subsequently, the participant’ s consent for 
FBR will be withdrawn. A letter will be sent from the Sponsor to the investigator confirming the withdrawal. It is the responsibility of the investigator to inform the participant of completion of withdrawal. Any analyses in progress at the time of request for withdrawal or already performed before the request being received by the Sponsor will continue to be used as part of the overall research study data and results. No new analyses would be generated 
after the request is received.  
If the medical records for the  study are no longer available (eg, if the investigator is no longer 
required by regulatory authorities to retain the study records) or the specimens have been 
completely anonymized, there will no longer be a link between the participant’s personal 
information and their specimens. In this situation, the request for specimen withdrawal cannot be processed.

ESRD participants will be admitted to the CRU on Day -1 of each period, at the time 
indicated by the CRU, and will be housed until after the 72 hours postdose and/or study 
procedures on Day 4. As per CRU preference, parti cipants may be confined throughout the 
study (ie, washout periods). 
Healthy participants will be admitted to the CRU on Day -1 , at the time indicated by the 
CRU, and will be housed until after the 72 hours postdose and/or study procedures on Day 4.  
All participants may be admitted earlier than Day  -1 for testing not related to study protocol 
as per CRU requirements (eg, COVID -19 testing). 
At all times, a participant may be required to remain at the CRU for longer at the discretion 
of the investigator or designee. 
8.1.13 Calibration of Equipment  
The investigator or qualified designee has the responsibility to ensure that any device or 
instrument used for a clinical evaluation/test during a clinica l study that provides information 
about inclusion/exclusion criteria and/or safety or efficacy parameters shall be suitably calibrated and /or maintained to ensure that the data obtained are reliable and/or reproducible. 
Documentation of equipment calibration must be retained as source documentation at the study site. 
8.2 Efficacy/Immunogenicity  Assessmen ts 
There are no direct efficacy assessments in this study.  
8.3 Safety Assessments  
Details regarding specific safety procedures/assessments to be performed in this study are provided. The total amount of blood to be drawn over the course of the study (from prestudy [screening] to poststudy [follow-up] visits), including approximate blood volumes drawn by 
visit and by sample type per participant, can be found in Section  10.8 (Appendix 8). 
Planned time points for all safety assessments are provided in the SoA. 
8.3.1 Physical Examinations  
A complete physical examination will be conducted by an investigator or medically qualified

BMI 
BMI equals a person’s weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared 
(BMI=kg/m2). BMI will be rounded to the nearest whole number according to the standard 
convention of 0.1 to 0.4 round down and 0.5 to 0.9 round up. 
Body weight and height will be obtained with the participant’s shoes off and jacket or coat 
removed. 
8.3.2 Vital Signs  
• Single measurements of T, RR, BP , and HR, will be measured as outlined in SoA 
(Section 1.3). Additional vital signs may be taken at any other times, if deemed 
necessary.  
• BP and HR measurements will be performed with participants in a seated position for at 
least 5 minutes before assessing vital signs, except when they are supine or semi -reclined 
because of study procedures and/or AEs (eg, nausea, dizziness) or if deemed necessary 
by the investigator or designee. 
8.3.3 Electrocardiograms  
• Single 12-lead ECG will be obtained and reviewed by an investigator or medically qualified designee (consistent with local requirements) as outlined in the SoA (Section 1.3 using an ECG machine that automatically calculates the HR and measures 
PR, QRS, QT, and QTc intervals. Additional ECGs may be taken at any other times, if deemed necessary by the investigator or des ignee.  
• ECGs will be performed with participants in a supine position, for at least 5 minutes before the measurement. All ECG tracings will be reviewed by the investigator or designee.  
• Special care must be taken for proper lead placement by qualified personnel. Skin should 
be clean and dry before lead placement. Participants may need to be shaved to ensure proper lead placement. Female participants may need to remove interfering garments.  
• The correction formula to be used for QTc is Fridericia. 
• If a participant demonstrates an increase in QTc interval ≥60 msec compared with the 
predose baseline measurement, the ECG will be repeated twice within 5 minutes. The median value of the QTc interval from the 3 ECGs will represent the value at that time point. If the median QTc interval increase from baseline for any postdose time point is 
≥60 msec, the participant will continue to be monitored by repeat 12- lead ECGs every 
15 minutes for at least 1 hour or until the QTc is within 60 msec of baseline. If 
prolongation of the QTc interval ≥60 msec persists, a consultation with a study 
cardiologist may be appropriate and the Sponsor should be notified.

MK-6482-021-03 FINAL PROTOCOL  17-APR-2023 
 
 
• If a participant demonstrates a QTc interval ≥500 msec on a postdose ECG, the ECG will 
be repeated twice within 5 minutes. The median value of the QTc interval from the 
3 ECGs will represent the value at that time point. If the median QTc interval is 
≥500 msec, the Sponsor should be notified and the ECGs should be reviewed by a 
cardiologist. The participant should be te lemetry monitored (until the QTc is <500 msec) 
or should be considered for transfer to a location where closer monitoring and definitive care (eg, a CCU or ICU) is available.  
• If at any time the QRS duration is prolonged ≥200 msec (and change is not considered rate related or pacing induced), then the Sponsor should be notified. The ECGs should be reviewed by a cardiologist and the participant should be considered for transfer to a 
location where closer monitoring and definitive care (eg, a CCU or ICU) is available.  
• If the participant has unstable hemodynamics, or has any clinically significant 
dysrhythmias noted on telemetry, the participant should be immediately transferred to an 
acute care setting for definitive therapy.  
• If prolongation of the QTc is noted, concomitant medications that prolong QTc should be 
held until the QTc is within 60 msec of baseline and the QTc is <500 msec. 
• A cardiologist may be consulted by the investigator as needed to review ECG tracings 
with significant abnormalities.  
8.3.4 Pulse Oxime try 
Pulse oximetry will be obtained as outlined in the SoA (Section  1.3). Each participant will 
have a baseline pulse oximetry (oxygen levels as saturation [%] and HR) reading done at 
check-in. 
Readings may be taken at other times, if deemed necessary by the investigator or designee. 
Any oxygen saturation reading deemed clinically significant by the investigator or designee 
will be documented. 
8.3.5 Hemodialysis  (for ESRD Participants Only)  
ESRD participants will receive HD as per their regular schedule.  
Period 1: For p articipants following a Monday, Wednesday, Friday HD schedule, study 
intervention will be administered immediately following their Friday HD session. For 
participants following a Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday HD schedule, study intervention will 
be administe red immediately following their Saturday HD session. The participant’s next 
regularly scheduled HD session (either Monday or Tuesday) should initiate immediately 
following the 72-hour blood draw.

be administered approximately 2 hours prior to their Saturday HD session. The HD session 
should initiate immediately following the 2 -hour PK blood draw. The HD period will be of 
approximately 4 hours. A pre-dialyzer plasma sample will be collected at the start of HD. 
Blood samples collected during HD will be collected from both the pre -dialyzer and 
post-dialyzer blood lines. 
The blood flow, dialysate flow, and the make and model of the dialyzer will be recorded. 
8.3.6 Clinical Safety Laboratory Assessments  
Refer to Appendix 2 for the list of clinical laboratory tests to be performed and to the SoA for 
the timing and frequency. 
• The investigator or medically qualified designee (consistent with local requirements) 
must review the laboratory report, document this review, a nd record any clinically 
relevant changes occurring during the study in the AE section of the e CRF. The 
laboratory reports must be filed with the source documents. Clinically significant 
abnormal laboratory findings are those which are not associated with the underlying 
disease, unless judged by the investigator to be more severe than expected for the participant ’s condition. 
• All protocol -required laboratory assessments, as defined in Appendix 2, must be 
conducted in accordance with the laboratory manual and the SoA. 
• If laboratory values from nonprotocol- specified laboratory assessments performed at the 
institution’s local laboratory require a change in study participant management or are considered clinically significant by the investigator (eg, SAE or AE or dose modification), then the results must be recorded in the appropriate eCRF (eg, SLAB).  
• For any laboratory tests with values considered clinically significantly abnormal during participation in the study or within 1 day after the last dose of study intervention , every 
attempt should be made to perform repeat assessments until the values return to normal or baseline or if a new baseline is established as determined by the investigator . 
 
8.3.7 Photograph of Rash 
Photographs of any rash are highly recommended to be taken immediately, along with any 
additional information that may assist the investigator to evaluate the skin reaction, skin 
eruption, or rash occurrence in determining etiology and relationship to the study intervention. 
8.4 Adverse Events, Serious Adverse Events, and Other Reportable Safety Events  
The definitions of an AE or SAE, as well as the method of recording, evaluating, and 
assessing causality of AE and SAE and the procedures for completing and transmitting AE, SAE, and other reportable safety event reports can be found in Appendix 3.

AEs, SAEs, and other reportable safety events will be reported by the participant (or, when 
appropriate, by a caregiver, surrogate, or the participant's legally authorized representative). 
The investigator and any designees  are responsible for detecting, documenting, and reporting 
events that meet the definition of an AE or SAE as well as other reportable safety events. 
Investigators remain responsible for following up AEs, SAEs, and other reportable safety 
events for outcome according to Section  8.4.3. 
The investigator, who is a qualified physician, will assess events that meet the definition of 
an AE or SAE as well as other reportable safety events with respect to seriousness, 
intensity/toxicity and causality . 
8.4.1 Time Period and Frequency for Collecting AE, SAE , and Other Reportable 
Safety Event Information  
AEs, SAEs, and other reportable safety events that occur after the participant pro vides 
documented informed consent, but before intervention allocation, must be reported by the 
investigator for randomized participants only if the event causes the participant to be excluded from the study, or is the result of a protocol-specified intervention, including, but not limited to washout or discontinuation of usual therapy, diet, placebo, or a procedure. 
From the time of intervention allocation through 14  days after cessation of intervention, all 
AEs, SAEs and other reportable safety events must  be reported by the investigator. 
Additionally, any SAE brought to the attention of an investigator any time outside the period 
specified in the previous paragraph also must be reported immediately to the Sponsor if the event is considered related to study  intervention. 
Investigators are not obligated to actively seek AEs or SAE s or other reportable safety events 
in former study participants. However, if the investigator learns of any SAE, including a death, at any time after a participant has been discharged from the study, and the investigator considers the event to be reasonabl y related to the study  intervention  or study participation, 
the investigator must promptly notify the Sponsor. 
All initial and follow -up AEs, SAEs, and other reportable safety events will be recorded and 
reported to the Sponsor or designee within the time frames as indicated in Table 3. 
Exception: A positive pregnancy test at the time of initial screening is not a reportable event 
unless the participant has received study intervention.

8.4.2 Method of Detecting AE s, SAEs, and Other Reportable Safety Events 
Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting AEs and/or SAEs and other 
reportable safety events. Open -ended and nonleading verbal questioning of the participant is 
the preferred method to inquire about AE occurrence. 
8.4.3 Follow-u p of AE, SAE, and Other Reportable Safety Event Information  
After the initial AE/SAE report, the investigator is required to proactively follow each 
participant at subsequent visits/contacts. All AE s, SAEs, and other reportable safety events, 
including pregnancy and exposure during breastfeeding, ECIs, cancer, and overdose will be followed until resolution, stabilization, until the event is otherwise explained, or the participant is lost to follow -up (as defined in Section  7.3). In addition, the investigator will 
make every attempt to follow all nonserious AEs that occur in allocated participants for 
outcome. Further information on follow-up procedures is given in Appendix 3. 
8.4.4 Regulatory Reporting Requirements for SAE  
Prompt notification (within 24 hours) by the investigator to the Sponsor of SAE is essential 
so that legal obligations and ethical responsibilities towards the safety of participa nts and the 
safety of a study intervention  under clinical investigation are met.

PROTOCOL/AMENDMENT N O.:  021-03    
 
 
MK-6482-021-03 FINAL PROTOCOL  17-APR-2023 
 
 
The Sponsor has a legal responsibility to notify both the local regulatory authority and other 
regulatory agencies about the safety of a study intervention under clinical investigation. The Sponsor will comply with country- specific regulatory requirements and global laws and 
regulations relating to safety reporting to regulatory authorities, IRB/IECs, and investigators.  
Investigator safety reports must be prepared for SUSAR s according to local regulatory 
requirements and Sponsor policy and forwarded to investigators as necessary. 
An investigator who receives an investigator safety report describing an SAE or other 
specific safety information (eg, summary or listing of SAE) fr om the Sponsor will file it 
along with the IB and will notify the IRB/IEC, if appropriate according to local requirements.  
8.4.5 Pregnancy and Exposure During Breastfeeding  
Although pregnancy and infant exposure during breastfeeding are not considered AEs, any 
pregnancy or infant exposure during breastfeeding in a participant (spontaneously reported to the investigator or their designee), including the pregnancy of a male participant’s female partner, that occurs during the study are reportable to the Sponsor. 
All reported pregnancies must be followed to the completion/termination of the pregnancy. 
Any pregnancy complication will be reported as an AE or SAE. 
The medical reason (example: maternal health or fetal disease) for an elective termination of 
a pregnancy w ill be reported as an AE or SAE. Prenatal testing showing fetus will be born 
with severe abnormalities/congenital anomalies that leads to an elective termination of a 
pregnancy will be reported as an SAE for the fetus. 
Pregnancy outcomes of ectopic pregnancy, spontaneous abortion, missed abortion, benign 
hydatidiform mole, blighted ovum, fetal death, intrauterine death, miscarriage, and stillbirth must be reported as serious events (Important Medical Events). If the pregnancy continues to term, the outcome (health of infant) must also be reported. 
8.4.6 Disease-r elated Events and/or Disease-r elated Outcomes Not Qualifying as 
AEs or SAEs  
Not applicable. 
8.4.7 Events of Clinical Interest  
Selected serious and nonserious AEs are also known as ECIs and must be reported to the 
Sponsor. 
Events of clinical interest for this study include:  
1. An overdose of Sponsor's product, as defined in Section  8.5. 
08RR0F

PROTOCOL/AMENDMENT N O.:  021-03    
 
 
MK-6482-021-03 FINAL PROTOCOL  17-APR-2023 
 
 
2. An elevated AST or ALT laboratory value t hat is greater than or equal to 3X the ULN 
and an elevated total bilirubin laboratory value that is greater than or equal to 2X the 
ULN and, at the same time, an alkaline phosphatase laboratory value that is less than 2X the ULN, as determined by way of protocol-specified laboratory testing or unscheduled laboratory testing.*  
*Note: These criteria are based on available regulatory guidance documents. The purpose of the criteria is to specify a threshold of abnormal hepatic tests that may require an 
additional evaluation for an underlying etiology. The study- site guidance for assessment 
and follow up of these criteria can be found in the Investigator Study File Binder (or 
equivalent). 
It may also be appropriate to conduct additional evaluation for an underlying etiology in 
the setting of abnormalities of liver blood tests including AST, ALT, bilirubin, and alkaline phosphatase that do not meet the criteria noted above. In these cases, the decision to proceed with additional evaluation will be made through consultation between the study investigators and the Sponsor Clinical Director. However, abnormalities of liver blood tests that do not meet the criteria noted above are not ECIs for this study. 
3. An AE of anemia  
4. An AE of hypoxia 
5. An AE of dyspnea 
 
8.5 Treatment of Overdose  
For purposes of this study, an overdose will be defined as any dose of any drug administered 
as part of the study exceeding the dose prescribed by the protocol. It is up to the investigator or the reporting physician to decide whether a dose is to be considered an overdose, in consultation with the Sponsor. 
8.6 Pharmacokinetics  
Plasma samples for evaluation of MK -6482 PK will be collected at scheduled time points as 
delineated in the SoA.  
The decision as to which plasma samples collected will be measured for evaluation of PK 
will be collaboratively determined by the Sponsor. If indicated, these samples may also be 
measured and/or pooled for assay in an expl oratory manner for metabolites.  
8.6.1 Blood Collection for Plasma MK -6482 
Sample collection, storage, and shipment instructions for plasma samples will be provided in the Study Operations Manual.

8.8 Biomarkers  
Collection of samples for other biomarker research is also part of this study. The following 
samples for biom arker research are required and will be collected from all participants as 
specified in the SoA:  
• Blood for genetic analysis 
8.8.1 Planned Genetic Analysis Sample Collection  
The planned genetic analysis sample will be drawn for UGT2B17 and CYP2C19 genotyping and for planned analysis of the association between genetic variants in DNA and drug 
response. If the IRB/IEC does not approve of the planned analysis of the association between 
DNA variation and drug response, or if there is a local law or regulation prohibiting the same, data analysis will be limited to UGT2B17 and CYP2C19. Leftover extracted DNA will be stored for FBR if the participant provides documented informed consent for FBR. 
Sample collection, storage, and shipment instructions for planned genetic ana lysis samples 
will be in the operations/laboratory manual.  
8.9 Future Biomedical Research Sample Collection  
If the participant provides documented informed consent for FBR, the following specimens 
will be obtained as part of FBR:  
• Leftover DNA for future research

8.11 Visit Requirements  
Visit requirements are outlined in Section 1.3. Specific procedure- related details are provided 
in sections below . 
8.11.1 Screening  
Approximately 28 days before ( initial) administration of study intervention, potential 
participants will be evaluated to determine that they fulfill the entry requirements as set forth 
in Section  5. 
Participants may be rescreened after consultation with the Sponsor. Rescreening should include all screening procedures listed in the SoA, including consent review. Rescreen procedures cannot be conducted the day prior to intervention allocation if there are Day -1 procedures planned per protocol.

8.11.2 Treatment Period  
Refer to the SoA ( Section 1.3). 
8.11.3 Participants  Discontinued From Study Intervention Continuing to be 
Monitored in the Study  
At any point if a participant discontinues from study intervention or the study but continues 
to be monitored in the study, all study procedures specified in the SoA may be completed at the discretion of the investigator and with Sponsor agreement. 
8.11.4 Poststudy (Follow- up) 
All participants who received at least one administration of study intervention (including 
participants who terminate the study early) will return to the CRU approximately 14  days 
after the last administration of study intervention for poststudy (follow-up) procedures, and 
to determine if any AE has occurred since the last study visit. If the poststudy visit occurs 
less than 14 days after administration  of study intervention, a subsequent follow-up telephone 
call should be made at 14 days post administration of study intervention to determine if any 
AEs have occurred since the poststudy cli nic visit. 
8.11.5 Critical Procedures Based on Study Objectives: Timing of Procedure  
For this study, the blood sample collection for MK-6482 is the critical procedure.  
At any postdose time point, the blood sample for MK-6482 need s to be collected as close to 
the exact time point as possible. All other procedures should be completed as close to the prescribed/scheduled time as possible. Study procedures can be performed before or after the prescribed/scheduled time.  
The order of priority can be changed during the study with joint agreement of the investigator and the Sponsor Clinical Director.  
Any nonscheduled procedures required for urgent evaluation of safety concerns take precedence over all routine scheduled procedures.  
The following variance in procedure collection times will be permitted.  
• PK Collection as outlined in Table 4 .

8.11.6 Study Design/Dosing/Procedures Modifications Permitted Within Protocol 
Parameters  
This is a Phase 1 assessment of MK -6482 in humans, and the PK, pharmacodynamic, and 
safety profiles of the compound are still being elucidated. This protocol is written with some flexibility to accommodate the inherent dynamic nature of Phase 1 clinical studies. Modifications to clinical or laboratory procedures currently outlined may be required to achieve the scientific goals of the study objectives and/or to ensure appropriate safety monitoring of the study participants.  
• Instructions to take study intervention with or without food or drink may also be modified based on newly available data 
• Modification of the PK/pharmacodynamic sample processing and shipping details based 
on newly available data  
The PK sampling scheme currently outlined in the protocol may be modified during the study 
based on newly available PK data (eg, to obtain data closer to the time of peak plasma concentrations). If indicated, these collected samples may also be assayed in an exploratory manner for metabolites and/or pharmacodynamic markers. 
Up to an additional 50 mL of blood may be drawn for safety and/or PK analyses. The total 
blood volume withdrawn from any single participant will not exceed the maximum allowable volume during their  participation in the entire study ( Appendix 8).  
The timing of procedures for assessment of safety procedures (eg, vital signs, ECG, safety laboratory tests, pulse oximetry, etc) may be modified during the study based on newly available data. Additional safety laboratory tests may be added to blood samples previously

drawn to obtain additional safety information. These changes will not increase the number of 
study procedures for a given participant during the ir participation in the entire study.  
It is understood that the current study may use some or none of the alterations described above. Any alteration made to this protocol to meet the study objectives must be detailed by 
the Sponsor in a letter to the Study File and forwarded to the investigator for retention. The 
letter may be forwarded to the IRB/IEC at the discretion of the investigator. 
9 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  PLAN 
Data will be handled and processed  according to Celerion SOPs, which are written based on 
the principles of GCP. 
9.1 Statistical Analysis Plan Summary  
This section contains a brief summary of the statistical analyses for this study. Full detail is 
in the SAP to be provided separately. 
Detailed methodology for summary and statistical a nalyses of the data collected in this study 
will be documented in an SAP. The SAP will be prepared by Celerion and agreed upon with 
the Sponsor. This document may modify the plans outlined in the protocol; however, any major modifications of the primary endpoints definition and/or its analysis will also be 
reflected in a protocol amendment. Additional statistical analyses other than those described 
in this section may be performed if deemed appropriate. 
9.2 Responsibility for Analyses  
The statistical analysis o f the data obtained from this study will be conducted by the Data 
Management and Biometrics department at Celerion.  
If, after the study has begun, changes are made to the statistical analysis stated below, then 
these deviations to the plan will be listed, along with an explanation as to why they occurred, 
in the CSR.  
9.3 Hypotheses/Estimation  
Primary Estimation: 
Estimation : The plasma PK (AUC0 -inf and Cmax) of MK-6482 following a single oral 
120 mg dose of MK- 6482 to participants with ESRD before and after HD will be estimated 
and compared to each other and to those in healthy matched control participants.  
Secondary Estimation: 
Estimation : The extent to which MK-6482 is removed by HD from the plasma 
(eg, CLD,  
plasma) will be estimated.

MK-6482-021-03 FINAL PROTOCOL  17-APR-2023 
 
 
9.4 Analysis Endpoints  
The primary PK endpoints will be AUC0- inf and Cmax of MK-6482 following a single oral 
dose of MK-6482 to participants with ESRD before and after HD to each other and to those 
in healthy matched control participants.  
Additional PK endpoints will include AUC0-last, AUC0 -24, AUC%extrap, Cmax, C24, 
Tmax, apparent terminal t½, λz, CL/F, and Vz/F. 
For ESRD participants in Period  2, the secondary PK endpoint for plasma MK-6482 will 
include CLD, plasma. Additional PK endpoints for ESRD participants in Period 2 will include 
Ca, Cv, AUC(2 -6)Ca, and AUC(2 -6)Cv. 
9.5 Analysis Populations  
The following populations are defined for the analysis and reporting of data. All participants 
will be reported, and their data analyzed, accord ing to the study intervention(s) they actually 
received. 
All Participants as Treated (APaT): The All Participants as Treated Population consists of all 
participants who received at least one dose of study intervention. This population will be 
used for assessments of safety and tolerability.  
Per-Protocol (PP) : The Per-Protocol Population consists of the subset of participants who 
comply with the protocol sufficiently to ensure that generated data will be likely to exhibit the effects of treatment, according to the underlying scientific model. Compliance covers 
such considerations as exposure to treatment, availability of measurements and absence of important protocol deviations. Important protocol deviations will be identified to the extent possible prior to unblinding by individuals responsible for data collection/compliance, and its analysis and interpretation. Any participants or data values excluded from analysis will be identified, along with their reason for exclusion, in the CSR. At the end of the study, all participants who are compliant with the study procedure as aforementioned and have 
available data considered sufficient to exhibit the effect of treatment will be included in the 
Per-Protocol dataset. This population will be used for the PK analyses. 
9.6 Statistical Methods  
9.6.1 PK Descriptive Statistics  
Individual values will be listed for each plasma PK parameter by group and analyte, and the 
following (non-model- based) descriptive statistics will be provided: N (number of 
participants with non -missing data), arithmetic mean, standard deviation, arithmetic percent 
CV (calculated as 100 x standard deviation/arithmetic mean), median, minimum, maximum, geometric mean, and geometric percent CV (calculated as 100  x sqrt(exp(s
2) – 1), where s2 is 
the observed variance on the natural log -scale.

MK-6482-021-03 FINAL PROTOCOL  17-APR-2023 
 
 
9.6.2 Renal Function Assessment  
The following renal function parameters will be calculated for each participant.  
1. BSA normalized eGFR  
The MDRD (Modification of Diet in Renal Disease) equation will be used to estimate 
GFR standardized  to a BSA of 1.73 m2: 
eGFR (mL/min/1.73m2) = 175 × standardized serum creatinine (mg/dL)-1.154× age-0.203 × 
(0.742 if female) × (1.212 if Black or African American).  
2. BSA un-normalized eGFR  
The MDRD equation provides an estimate of GFR standardized to a BSA  of 1.73 m2, and 
it is therefore necessary to multiply this estimate by each participant’s ratio of BSA/1.73 
to determine the participant specific BSA un -normalized GFR:  
eGFR (mL/min) = eGFR (mL/min/1.73m2) × [BSA (m2) / 1.73]. 
The BSA of an individual is calculated using the following equation:  
BSA (m2) = [weight (kg)0.425 × height (cm)0.725] × 0.007184. ( Dubois and Dubois, 1916, 
Wang et al., 1992) Note:  The participants categorized into different renal categories based on BSA 
normalized eGFR may not fall into the same renal categories after re -categorization b ased 
on BSA un- normalized eGFR.  
3. CLcr using the C-G Equation 
CLcr will be estimated using the following equation: 
CLcr 
 = {[140 - age(yr)] × [body wt (kg)] × (0.85 if female)} / [72 × serum creat 
(mg/dL)] 
Note:  The participants categorized into different renal categories based on eGFR using 
MDRD equation may not fall into the same renal categor ies after re -categorization  based 
on CLcr by C-G equation. 
9.6.3 PK Statistical Analysis  
Separately for each PK parameter, individual values of MK-6482 AUC0-inf, AUC0 -24, and 
Cmax will be natural log -transformed and evaluated with a linear mixed  effects model 
containing a fixed  effect for population (participants with ESRD before and after HD, control 
participants with normal renal function). An unstructured covariance matrix will be used to allow for unequal population variances and to model the correlation betw een repeated 
08RR0F

PROTOCOL/AMENDMENT N O.:  021-03    
 
 
MK-6482-021-03 FINAL PROTOCOL  17-APR-2023 
 
 
measures (before and after HD) within each ESRD participant via the REPEATED and 
SUBJECT statement in SAS PROC MIXED. Kenward and Roger’s method will be used to calculate the denominator degrees of freedom for the fixed effect (DDFM=KR). Ninet y 
percent (90%) CIs for the least squares means for each population will be constructed on the 
natural log scale and will reference the t -distribution. Exponentiating the least- squares means 
and their corresponding 90% confidence limits will yield estimates for the population 
geometric means and confidence intervals about the geometric means on the original scale. 
Sample SAS code is given below: 
proc mixed  data=data;  
class population subject;  
model lnpk = population /ddfm=kr;  
repeated population/ subject=subject type=UN;  
lsmeans population /cl alpha=0.10; 
lsmeans population/pdiff alpha=0.10;  
run;  
 
To address the primary estimation objective and compare participants with ESRD before and after HD to participants with normal renal function, a two sided 90% CI for the difference in 
least-squares means (ESRD before HD – normal renal function, ESRD after HD – normal 
renal function) will be calculated for each PK parameter using the aforementioned model. 
These confidence limits will be exponentiated to obtain the 90% CI  for the ratio of geometric 
means (ESRD before HD/normal renal function, ESRD after HD/normal renal function) for 
each PK parameter. The same approach will be used to address the secondary estimation 
objective. The extent to which MK-6482 is removed from plasma by HD will be evaluated with the difference in means (ESRD before HD – ESRD after HD), the geometric mean ratio 
(ESRD before HD/ESRD after HD) and their 90% CIs. A sensitivity analysis may be 
performed without PMs  at UGT2B17 or CYP2C19 if applicable as deemed clinically 
appropriate.  
Figures showing summary plasma concentration- time profiles by population for MK -6482 
(linear plot with arithmetic mean (±SD) for concentration and semi- log plot with arithmetic 
mean) will be provided. A table showing summary PK parameter values with GMs (%GCV) 
by population, will be provided for MK -6482 AUC0-inf, AUC0 -24, Cmax, Tmax, and 
apparent terminal t½. A table showing the GMR (ESRD before HD /normal renal function, 
ESRD after HD/normal renal function, ESRD before HD/ESRD after HD) and corresponding 90% CI will be provided for PK parameters, AUC0 -inf and Cmax .  
Individual values will be listed for each PK parameter for MK -6482 (AUC0-inf, AUC0 -last, 
AUC0-24, AUC%ext rap ([percentage of AUC0- inf obtained by extrapolation from 24 hours 
to ∞], λz [ terminal elimination rate constant], Cmax, Tmax, CL/F, Vz/F, λz, apparent 
terminal t½, CLD, 
plasma [dialysis clearance based on plasma], Ca [concentration in plasma 
samples from the pre- dialyzer line during the dialysis period ], and Cv [concentration in 
plasma samples from the post -dialyzer line during the dialysis pe riod]. The following 
(non-model- based) descriptive statistics will be provided: N (number of participants with

non-missing data), arithmetic mean, standard deviation, arithmetic percent CV (calculated as 
100 x standard deviation/arithmetic mean), median, m inimum, maximum, geometric mean, 
and geometric percent CV (calculated as 100 x sqrt(exp(s2) - 1), where s2 is the observed 
variance on the natural log -scale). Descriptive statistics may be provided based on UGT2B17 
and/or CYP2C19 phenotypes separately. 
Individual participant PK parameter values will also be plotted against BSA normalized 
eGFR and against BSA un-normalized eGFR, using different symbols to identify participants 
from each population. For this analysis, eGFR may be calculated as the mean of the two 
values determined at the prestudy (screening) visit . Plots of PK parameters versus CLcr  
obtained from C-G equation may be provided. Additionally, plots of PK parameter values 
versus age and BMI may be provided. PK conce ntration listings for MK -6482 in plasma, 
including Ca and Cv  concentrations, will be provided for each participant; AUC(2-6)Ca 
(plasma AUC values determined from Ca versus time profile during the dialysis period from 
2 hours to 6 hours postdose using ‘linear up, log down’ calculation method option in 
WinNonlin), AUC(2 -6)Cv (plasma AUC values determined from Cv versus time profile 
during the dialysis period from 2 hours to 6 hours postdose using ‘linear up, log down’ 
calculation method option in WinNonlin) f or MK-6482 during HD in P eriod 2 will be 
provided for each ESRD participant. 
9.6.4 Safety Analysis 
All AEs, vital signs, ECGs, pulse oximetry, and clinical safety laboratory values will be 
listed for each participant and tabulated by population. Summary statistics for the clinical 
safety laboratory tests, vital signs, and/or ECGs may also be computed and provided, as 
deemed clinically appropriate.  
9.7 Interim Analyses  
Not applicable. 
9.8 Multiplicity  
Not applicable. 9.9 Sample Size and Power Calculations  
The sample size selected to evaluate the effect of renal impairment on the PK of MK -6482 
was not chosen to satisfy any a priori statistical requirement. This sample size (N=6 per 
group) has historically been shown to be sufficient for studies of this type and should provide adequate data to support the planned analyses. Nevertheless, estimates of the expected precision of the estimates, based on these sample sizes and the known variability obtained from renal PK studies are presented below.  
The precision of t he estimated GMRs (ESRD before or after HD / normal renal function) of 
PK parameters obtained from this study can be assessed by calculating the half -width of the

90% CIs expected for the given sample size and assumed variability. The observed 
between-participant coefficients of variation were 62.44% (~0.574 standard deviation on the 
log scale) and 56.29% (~0.525 standard deviation on the log scale) for AUC0- inf from 
food-effect study (Protocol MK-6482-002) and comparative bioavailability study (Protocol 
MK-6482-006), respectively. Assuming a sample size of 6 participants per population and 
observed between-participant SD is 0.574 on the log scale, then the half width of the 90% CI 
of GMR for MK-6482 AUC0 -inf on the log scale will be 0.545. The lower and upper 90% 
confidence limits for the GMR will be given by OBS/1.72 and OBS*1.72 for AUC0 -inf, 
where OBS is the observed GMR. Thus, for example, if the observed GMR for AUC0 -inf 
was 1.50, then the approximate 90% CI for the GMR would be [0.87, 2.59]. 
Similarly, the observed between -participant coefficients of variation were 26.04% 
(~0.256 SD  on the log scale) and 25.25% (~0.249 SD  on the log scale) for Cmax from 
Protocol MK -6482-002 and Protocol MK -6482-006, respectively. Assuming a sample siz e of 
6 participants per population and observed between-participant SD is 0.256 on the log scale, 
then the half width of the 90% CI of GMR for MK -6482 Cmax on the log scale will be 
0.243. The lower and upper 90% confidence limits for the GMR will be given by OBS/1.28 and OBS*1.28 for Cmax. Thus, for example, if the observed GMR for Cmax was 1.50, then the approximate 90% CI for the GMR would be [1.18, 1.91].

10 SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION AND OPERATIONAL 
CONSIDERATIONS  
10.1 Appendix 1: Regulatory, Ethical, and Study O versight Considerations 
10.1.1 Code of Conduct for Clinical Trials 
Merck Sharp & Dohme LLC, Rahway, NJ, USA  (MSD) 
Code of Conduct for Interventional Clinical Trials  
I. Introduction 
A. Purpose 
MSD, through its subsidiaries, conducts clinical trials worldwide to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of our 
products. As such, we are committed to designing, implementing, conducting, analyzing, and reporting these trials 
in compliance with the highest ethical and scientific standards. Protection of participants in clinical trials is the 
overriding concern in the design and conduct of clinical trials. In all cases, MSD clinical trials will be conducted 
in compliance with local and/or national regulations (including all applicable data protection laws and  
regulations), and International Council for Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice (ICH -GCP), and also in 
accordance with the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.  
B. Scope 
Highest ethical and scientific standards shall be endorsed for all clinical interventional investigations sponsored by 
MSD irrespective of the party (parties) employed for their execution (eg, contract research organizations, collaborative research efforts). This Code is not intended to apply to trials that are observational in nature, or 
which are retrospective. Further, this Code does not apply to investigator-initiated trials, which are not under the 
full control of MSD.  
II. Scientific Issues  
A. Trial Conduct  
1. Trial Design  
Except for pilot or estimation trials, cl inical trial protocols will be hypothesis -driven to assess safety, efficacy 
and/or pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic indices of MSD or comparator products. Alternatively, MSD may conduct outcomes research trials, trials to assess or validate various endpo int measures, or trials to 
determine patient preferences, etc.  
The design (ie, participant population, duration, statistical power) must be adequate to address the specific 
purpose of the trial  and shall respect the data protection rights of all participan ts, trial site staff and, where 
applicable, third parties . All trial protocols are and will be assessed for the need and capability to enroll 
underrepresented groups. Participants must meet protocol entry criteria to be enrolled in the trial.  
2. Site Selection 
MSD’s clinical trials are conducted globally in many different countries and in diverse populations, including 
people of varying age, race, ethnicity, gender, and accounting for other potential disease related factors. MSD selects investigative sites  based on medical expertise, access to appropriate participants, adequacy of facilities 
and staff, previous performance in clinical trials, as well as budgetary considerations. Prior to trial initiation, sites are evaluated by MSD personnel (or individuals acting on behalf of MSD) to assess the ability to 
successfully conduct the trial.

PROTOCOL/AMENDMENT N O.:  021-03    
 
 
MK-6482-021-03 FINAL PROTOCOL  17-APR-2023 
 
 
Where appropriate, and in accordance with regulatory authority guidance, MSD will make concerted efforts 
to raise awareness of clinical trial opportunities in various communities. MSD will seek to engage 
underrepresented groups and those disproportionately impacted by the disease under study. MSD will support 
clinical trial investigators to enroll underrepresented groups and expand access to those who will ultimately 
use the products under investigation.  
3. Site Monitoring/Scientific Integrity 
Investigative trial sites are monitored to assess compliance with the trial protocol and Good Clinical Practice 
(GCP). MSD reviews clinical data for accuracy, completeness, and consisten cy. Data are verified versus 
source documentation according to standard operating procedures. Per MSD policies and procedures, if  
potential fraud, scientific/research misconduct , privacy incidents/breaches  or Clinical Trial-related 
Significant Quality Issues are reported, such matters are investigated. When necessary, appropriate corrective 
and/or preventative actions are defined and regulatory authorities and/or ethics review committees are 
notified. 
B. Publication and Authorship  
Regardless of trial outcome, MSD commits to publish the primary and secondary results of its registered trials of 
marketed products in which treatment is assigned, according to the pre -specified plans for data analysis. To the 
extent scientifically appropriate, MSD seeks to publish the results of other analyses it conducts that are important 
to patients, physicians, and payers. Some early phase or pilot trials are intended to be hypothesis -generating rather 
than hypothesis testing; in such cases, publication of results may not be appropriate since the trial may be underpowered and the analyses complicated by statistical issues such as multiplicity. 
MSD’s policy on authorship is consistent with the recommendations published by the International Committee of 
Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE). In summary, authorship should reflect significant contribution to the design and 
conduct of the trial, performance or interpretation of the analysis, and/or writing of the manuscript. All named 
authors must be able to defend the trial results and conclusions. MSD funding of a trial will be acknowledged in 
publications. 
III. Participant Protection  
A. Regulatory Authority and Ethics Committee Review (Institutional Review Board [IRB]/Independent Ethics 
Committee [IEC]) 
All protocols and protocol amendments will be submitted by MSD for regulatory authority 
acceptance/authorization prior to implementation of the trial or amendment, in compliance with local and/or 
national regulations.  
The protocol, protocol amendment(s), informed consent form, investigator’s brochure, and other relevant trial documents must be reviewed and approved by an IRB/IEC before being implemented at each site, in compliance 
with local and/or national regulations. Changes to the protocol that are required urgently to eliminate an 
immediate hazard and to protect participant safety may be enacted in anticipation of ethics committee approval. 
MSD will inform regulatory authorities of such new measures to protect participant safety, in compliance with local and/or national regulations.  
B. Safety 
The guiding principle in decision -making in clinical trials is that participant welfare is of primary importance. 
Potential participants will be informed of the risks and benefits of, as well as alternatives to, trial participation. At a minimum, tr ial designs will take into account the local standard of care.  
All participation in MSD clinical trials is voluntary. Participants enter the trial only after informed consent is obtained. Participants may withdraw from an MSD trial at any time, without any  influence on their access to, or 
receipt of, medical care that may otherwise be available to them.

MK-6482-021-03 FINAL PROTOCOL  17-APR-2023 
 
 
C. Confidentiality 
MSD is committed to safeguarding participant confidentiality, to the greatest extent possible , as well as all 
applicable data protection rights. Unless required by law, only the investigator, Sponsor (or individuals acting on 
behalf of MSD), ethics committee, and/or regulatory authorities will have access to confidential medical records 
that might identify the participant by name.  
D. Genomic Research  
Genomic research will only be conducted in accordance with a protocol and informed consent authorized by an 
ethics committee.  
IV. Financial Considerations  
A. Payments to Investigators  
Clinical trials are time - and labor-intensive. It is MS D’s policy to compensate investigators (or the sponsoring 
institution) in a fair manner for the work performed in support of MSD trials. MSD does not pay incentives to enroll participants in its trials. However, when enrollment is particularly challenging,  additional payments may be 
made to compensate for the time spent in extra recruiting efforts.  
MSD does not pay for participant referrals. However, MSD may compensate referring physicians for time spent 
on chart review and medical evaluation to identify potentially eligible participants.  
B. Clinical Research Funding  
Informed consent forms will disclose that the trial is sponsored by MSD, and that the investigator or sponsoring 
institution is being paid or provided a grant for performing the trial. However, the local ethics committee may 
wish to alter the wording of the disclosure statement to be consistent with financial practices at that institution. As noted above, all publications resulting from MSD trials will indicate MSD as a source of funding.  
C. Funding for Travel and Other Requests 
Funding of travel by investigators and support staff (eg, to scientific meetings, investigator meetings, etc.) will be 
consistent with local guidelines and practices.  
V. Investigator Commitment 
Investigators will be expected to review MSD’s Code of Conduct as an appendix to the trial protocol, and in signing the 
protocol, agree to support these ethical and scientific standards. 
 
10.1.2 Financial Disclosure  
Financial disclosure requirements are outlined in the US Food and Drug Admi nistration 
Regulations, Financial Disclosure by Clinical Investigators (21 CFR Part 54). It is the 
Sponsor’s responsibility to determine, based on these regulations, whether a request for financial disclosure information is required. It is the investigator’s/subinvestigator’ s 
responsibility to comply with any such request. 
The investigator/subinvestigator(s) agree, if requested by the Sponsor in accordance with 
21 CFR Part 54, to provide their  financial interests in and/or arrangements with the Sponsor 
to allow for the submission of complete and accurate certification and disclosure statements.

MK-6482-021-03 FINAL PROTOCOL  17-APR-2023 
 
 
The investigator/subinvestigator(s) further agree to provide this information on a 
Certification/Disclosure Form, frequently known as a financial disclosure form, provided by 
the Sponsor. The investigator/subinvestigator(s) also consent to the transmission of this information to the Sponsor in the United States for these purposes. This may involve the transmission of information to countries that do not have laws prote cting personal data.  
10.1.3 Data Protection 
The Sponsor will conduct this study in compliance with all applicable data protection 
regulations. 
Participants will be assigned a unique identifier by the Sponsor. Any participant records or 
datasets that are transferred to the Sponsor will contain the identifier only; participant names 
or any information that would make the participant identifiable will not be transferred.  
The participant must be informed that their personal study-related data will be used by the 
Sponsor in accordance with local data protection law. The level of disclosure must also be explained to the participant.  
The participant must be informed that their medical records may be examined by Clinical Quality Assurance auditors or other authorized personnel appointed by the Sponsor, by appropriate IRB/IEC members, and by inspectors from regulatory authorities. 
10.1.3.1 Confidentiality of Data  
By signing this protocol, the investigator affirms to the Sponsor that information furnished to 
the investigator by the Sponsor will be maintained in confidence, and such information will be divulged to the IRB , IEC, or similar or expert committee; affiliated institution and 
employees, only under an appropriate understanding of confidentiality with such board or committee, affiliated institution and employees. Data generated by this study will be considered confidential by the investigator, except to the extent that it is included in a publication as provided in the Publications section of this protocol. 
10.1.3.2 Confidentiality of Participant Records 
By signing this protocol, the investigator agrees that the Sponsor (or Sponsor representative), 
IRB/IEC, or regulatory authority representatives may consult and/or copy study documents to verify worksheet/e CRF data. By signing the consent form, the participant agrees to this 
process. If study documents will be photocopied during the process of verifying worksheet/e CRF information, the participant will be identified by unique code only; full 
names/initials will be masked before tra nsmission to the Sponsor. 
By signing this protocol, the investigator agrees to treat all participant data used and disclosed in connection with this study in accordance with all applicable privacy laws, rules and regulations.

10.1.3.3 Confidentiality of IRB/IEC Information 
The Sponsor is required to record the name and address of each IRB/IEC that reviews and 
approves this study. The Sponsor is also required to document that each IRB/IEC meets 
regulatory and ICH GCP requirements by requesting and maintaining records of the names 
and qualifications of the IRB/IEC members and to make these records available for 
regulatory agency review upon request by those agencies. 
10.1.4 Publication  Policy 
The results of this study may be published or presented at scientific meetings. The Sponsor 
will comply with the requirements for publication of study results. In accordance with 
standard editorial and ethical practice, the Sponsor will generally support publication of 
multicenter studies only in their entirety and not as individual site data. In this case, a 
coordinating investigator will be designated by mutual agreement. 
If publication activity is not directed by the Sponsor, the investigator agrees to submit all 
manuscripts or abstracts to the Sponsor before submission. This allows the Sponsor to protect proprietary information and to provide comments. 
Authorship will be determined by mutual agreement and in line with I CMJE authorship 
requirement s. 
10.1.5 Compliance with Study Registration and Results Posting Requirements  
Under the terms of th e FDAAA of 2007 and the EMA clinical trial Directive 2001/20/EC, the 
Sponsor of the study is solely responsible for determining whether the study and its results 
are subject  to the requirements for submission to http://www.clinicaltrials.gov, 
www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu or other local registries. MSD, as Sponsor of this study, will review this protocol and submit the information necessary to fulfill these requirements. MSD 
entries are not limited to FDAAA or the EMA clinical trials  directive mandated  trials. 
Information posted will allow participants to identify potentially appropriate studies for their 
disease conditions and pursue participation by calling a central contact number for further information on appropriate study locations and study- site contact information. 
By signing this protocol, the investigator acknowledges that the statutory obligations under FDAAA, the EMA clinical trials directive, or other locally mandated registries are that of the 
Sponsor and agrees not to submit any information about this study or i ts results to those 
registries.  
10.1.6 Compliance with Law, Audit, and Debarment 
By signing this protocol, the investigator agrees to conduct the study in an efficient and diligent manner and in conformance with this protocol; generally accepted standards of G CP

all applicable federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations relating to the  conduct of the 
clinical study.  
The Code of Conduct, a collection of goals and considerations that govern the ethical and 
scientific conduct of clinical investigations sponsored by MSD, is provided in this appendix 
under the Code of Conduct for Clinical Trials . 
The investigator agrees not to seek reimbursement from p articipants, their insurance 
providers, or from government programs for procedures included as part of the study reimbursed to the investigator by the Sponsor. 
The investigator will promptly inform the Sponsor of any regulatory authority inspection 
conducted for this study. 
The investigator agrees to provide the Sponsor with relevant information from inspection 
observations/findings to allow the Sponsor to assist in responding to any citations resulting from regulatory authority inspection and will provide the Sponsor with a copy of the proposed response for consultation before submission to the regulatory authority.  
Persons debarred from conducting or working on clinical studies by any court or regulatory 
authority will not be allowed to conduct or work on this Sponsor’s studies. The investigator will immediately disclose in writing to the Sponsor if any person who is involved in 
conducting the study is debarred or if any proceeding for debarment is pending or, to the best 
of the investigator’s knowledge, threatened. 
10.1.7 Data Quality Assurance 
All participant data relating to the study will be recorded on printed or electronic CRF unless 
transmitted to the Sponsor or designee electronically (eg, laboratory data). The investigator or qualified designee is responsible for verifyi ng that data entries are accurate and correct by 
physically or electronically signing the CRF.  
Detailed information regarding Data Management procedures for this protocol will be provided separately. 
The investigator must maintain accurate documentation (source data) that supports the 
information entered in the e CRF. 
The investigator must permit study -related monitoring, audits, IRB/IEC review, and 
regulatory agency inspections and provide direct access to source data documents. 
Study documentation will be promptly and fully disclosed to the Sponsor by the investigator 
upon request and also shall be made available at the study site upon request for inspection, copying, review, and audit at reasonable times by representatives of the Sponsor or any regulatory authorities. The investigator agrees to promptly take any reasonable steps that are requested by the Sponsor or any regulatory authorit ies as a result of an audit or inspection to 
cure deficiencies in the stud y documentation and worksheets/e CRFs.

The Sponsor or designee is responsible for the data management of this study including 
quality checking of the data. 
Study monitors will perform ongoing source data review and verification to confirm that data 
entered into the eCRF by authorized site personnel are accurate, complete, and verifiable 
from source documents; that the safety and rights of participants are being protected; and that 
the study is being conducted in accordance with the currently approved protocol and any 
other study agreements, ICH GCP, and all applicable regulatory requirements.  
Records and documents, including participants’ documented informed consent, pertaining to the conduct of this study must be retained by the investigator for 15 years after study 
completion unless local regulations or  institutional policies require a longer retention period. 
No records may be destroyed during the retention period without the written approval of the 
Sponsor. No records may be transferred to another location or party without written 
notification to the S ponsor. 
10.1.8 Source Documents  
Source documents provide evidence for the existence of the participant and substantiate the 
integrity of the data collected. The investigator/institution should maintain adequate and accurate source documents and study records that  include all pertinent observations on each 
of the site’s participants. Source documents and data should be attributable, legible, 
contemporaneous, original, accurate, and complete. Changes to source data should be 
traceable, should not obscure the original entry, and should be explained if necessary (eg, via an audit trail). Source documents are filed at the investigator’s site.  
Data reported on the CRF or entered in the eCRF that are transcribed from source documents must be consistent with the source documents or the discrepancies must be explained. The investigator /institution  may need to request previous medical records or transfer records, 
depending on the study. Also, current medical records must be available.

10.3 Appendix 3: A dverse Events: Definitions and Procedures for Recording, 
Evaluating, Follow-u p, and Reporting  
10.3.1 Definition of AE  
AE definition 
• An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant, temporally 
associated with the use of study intervention, whether or not considered related to the 
study intervention. 
• Note: An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an 
abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally 
associated with the use of a study intervention. 
• Note: For purposes of AE definition, study intervention (also referred to as  Sponsor’s 
product) includes any pharmaceutical product, biological product, vaccine, diagnostic 
agent, medical device, combination product, or protocol specified procedure whether investigational or marketed  (including placebo, active comparator product, or run-in 
intervention) , manufact ured by, licensed by, provided by, or distributed by the Sponsor 
for human use in this study. 
 
Events meeting the AE definition 
• Any abnormal laboratory test results (hematology, clinical chemistry, or urinalysis) or other safety assessments (eg, ECG, radiological scans, vital signs measurements), including those that worsen from baseline, considered clinically significant in the medical and scientific judgment of the investigator. 
• Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent preexisting condition including either an increase in frequency and/or intensity of the condition. 
• New conditions detected or diagnosed after study intervention administration even though it may have been present before the start of the study. 
• Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected drug-drug interaction. 
• Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study intervention or a concomitant medication. 
• For all reports of overdose (whether accidental or intentional) with an associated AE, the AE term should reflect the clinical symptoms or abnormal test result. An overdose 
without any associated clinical symptoms or abnormal laboratory results is reported using the terminology “accidental or intentional overdose without adverse effect.”

PROTOCOL/AMENDMENT N O.:  021-03    
 
 
MK-6482-021-03 FINAL PROTOCOL  17-APR-2023 
 
 
Events NOT meeting the AE d efinition 
• Medical or surgical procedure (eg, endoscopy, appendectomy): the condition that leads to 
the procedure is the AE. 
• Situations in which an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or convenience admission to a hospital). 
• Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of preexisting disease(s) or condition(s) present or 
detected at the start of the study that do not worsen. 
• Surgical procedure(s) planned prior to  informed consent to treat a preexisting condition 
that has not worsened. 
• Refer to Section 8.4.6 for protocol-specific exceptions.  
10.3.2 Definition of SAE  
If an event is not an AE per definition above, then it cannot be an SAE even if serious conditions are met. 
An SAE is defined as any untowar d medical occurrence that, at any dose:  
a. Results in death  
b. Is life-threatening  
• The term “life -threatening ” in the definition of “serious” refers to an event in which 
the participant was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an 
event, which hypothetically might have caused death, if it were more severe. 
c. Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
• Hospitalization is defined as an inpatient admission, regardless of length of stay, even if the hospitalization is a precautionary measure for continued observation. (Note: Hospitalization for an elective procedure to treat a preexisting condition that has not worsened is not an SAE.) A preexisting condition is a clinical condition that is 
diagnosed prior to  the use of an MSD product and is documented in the participant’s 
medical history. 
d. Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct 
normal life functions.  
• This definition is not intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical 
significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma (eg, sprained ankle) that may interfere with or prevent everyday life functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption. 
e. Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect 
• In offspring of participant taking the product regardless of time to diagnosis.

f. Other important medical events  
• Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether SAE 
reporting is appropriate in other situations such as important medical events that may 
not be immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may 
jeopardize the participant or may require medical or surgical in tervention to prevent 1 
of the other outcomes listed in the above definition. These events should usually be considered serious. 
• Examples of such events include invasive or malignant cancers, intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization, or development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 
 
10.3.3 Additional Events Reported  
Additional events that require reporting  
In addition to the above criteria, AEs meeting either of the below criteria, although not serious per ICH definition, are reportable to the Sponsor. 
• Is a cancer  
• Is associated with an overdose  
10.3.4 Recording AE and SAE  
AE and SAE r ecording 
• When an AE/SAE occurs, it is the responsibility of the investigator to review all 
documentation (eg, hospital progress notes, laboratory, and diagnostics reports) related to 
the event.   
• The investigator will record all relevant AE/SAE information on the AE eCRFs/worksheets at each examination.  
• It is not acceptable for the  investigator to send photocopies of the participant’s medical 
records to the Sponsor in lieu of completion of the AE e CRF page.   
• There may be instances when copies of medical records for certain cases are requested by 
the Sponsor. In this case, all participant identifiers, with the exception of the participant 
number, will be blinded on the copies of the medical records before submission to the Sponsor.  
• The investigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, symptoms, and/or other clinical information. In such cases, the diagnosis (not the individual signs/symptoms) will be documented as the AE/SAE.

Assessment of i ntensity /toxicity 
• An event is defined as “serious” when it meets at least 1 of the predefined outcomes as 
described in the definition of an SAE, not when it is rated as severe. 
 
• The investigator will make an assessment of intensity for each AE and SAE (and other 
reportable safety event) reported during the study and assign it to 1 of the following 
categories:  
- Mild: An event that is easily tolerated by the participant, causing minimal discomfort, 
and not interfering with everyday activities (for pediatric studies, awareness of symptoms, but easily tolerated).  
- Moderate: An event that causes sufficient discomfort to inter fere with normal 
everyday activities (for pediatric studies, definitely acting like something is wrong). 
- Severe: An event that prevents normal everyday activities. An AE that is assessed as 
severe should not be confused with an SAE. Severe is a category used for rating the 
intensity of an event; and both AE and SAE can be assessed as severe (for pediatric studies, extremely distressed or unable to do usual activities).  
Assessment of causality 
• Did the Sponsor’s product cause the AE? 
• The determination of the likelihood that the Sponsor’s product caused the AE will be provided by an investigator who is a qualified physician. The investigator’s signed/dated initials on the source document or worksheet that supports the causality noted on the AE form, ensures tha t a medically qualified assessment of causality was done. This initialed 
document must be retained for the required regulatory time frame. The criteria below are intended as reference guidelines to assist the investigator in assessing the likelihood of a relationship between the test product and the AE based upon the available information. 
• The following components are to be used to assess the relationship between the 
Sponsor’s product and the AE ; the greater the correlation with the components and 
their respective elements (in number and/or intensity), the more likely the Sponsor’s 
product caused the AE: 
- Exposure:  Is there evidence that the participant was actually exposed to the 
Sponsor’s product such as: reliable history, acceptable compliance assessment ( pill 
count, diary, etc), expected pharmacologic effect, or measurement of 
drug/metabolite in bodily specimen? 
- Time Course:  Did the AE follow in a reasonable temporal sequence from 
administration of the Sponsor’s product? Is the time of onset of the AE compatible 
with a drug- induced effect (applies to studies with investigational medicinal 
product)? 
- Likely Cause:  Is the AE not reasonably explained by another etiology such as 
underlying disease, other drug(s)/vaccine(s), or other host or environmental factors. 
- Dechallenge:  Was the Sponsor’s product discontinued or dose/exposure/frequency 
reduced?

◦ If yes, did the AE resolve or improve? 
◦ If yes, this is a positive dechallenge.  
◦ If no, this is a negative dechallenge.  
(Note: This criterion is not applicable if: (1) the AE resulted in death or permanent 
disability; (2) the AE resolved/improved despite continuation of the Sponsor’s 
product; (3) the study is a single -dose drug study; or (4) Sponsor’s product(s) is/are 
only used 1 time.) 
- Rechallenge:  Was the participant re -exposed to the Sponsor’s product in this study? 
◦ If yes, did the AE recur or worsen? 
◦ If yes, this is a pos itive rechallenge.  
◦ If no, this is a negative rechallenge. 
(Note: This criterion is not applicable if: (1) the initial AE resulted in death or permanent disability, or (2) the study is a single-dose drug study; or (3) Sponsor’s 
product(s) is/are used only 1 time.) 
NOTE: IF A RECHALLENGE IS PLANNED FOR AN AE THAT WAS SERIOUS AND MAY HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY THE SPONSOR’S PRODUCT, OR IF RE -EXPOSURE 
TO THE SPONSOR’S PRODUCT POSES ADDITIONAL POTENTIAL SIGNIFICANT 
RISK TO THE PARTICIPANT THEN THE RECHALLENGE MUST BE APPROVED IN 
ADVANCE BY THE SPONSOR CLINICAL DIRECTOR, AND IF REQUIRED, THE 
IRB/IEC.  
• Consistency with study intervention profile: Is the clinical/pathological presentation of 
the AE consistent with previous knowledge regarding the Sponsor’s product or drug class 
pharmacology or toxicology? 
• The assessment of relationship will be reported on the eCRFs/worksheets by an 
investigator who is a qualified physician according to their best clinical judgment, including consideration of the above elements. 
• Use the following scale of criteria as guidance (not all criteria must be present to be indicative of a Sponsor’s product relationship). 
- Yes, there is a reasonable possibility of Sponsor’s product relationship: 
◦ There is evidence of exposure to the Sponsor’s product. The temporal sequence of the AE onset relative to the administration of the Sponsor’s product is reasonable. The AE is more likel y explained by the Sponsor’s product than by 
another cause.  
- No, there is not a reasonable possibility of Sponsor’s product relationship: 
◦ Participant did not receive the Sponsor’s product OR temporal sequence of the AE onset relative to administration of th e Sponsor’s product is not reasonable 
OR the AE is more likely explained by another cause than the Sponsor’s product. (Also entered for a participant with overdose without an associated AE.)

• The investigator must review and provide an assessment of causali ty for each AE/SAE 
and document this in the medical notes. 
• There may be situations in which an SAE has occurred and the investigator has minimal 
information to include in the initial report to the Sponsor. However, it is very important 
that the investigato r always make an assessment of causality for every event before the 
initial transmission of the SAE data to the Sponsor.  
• The investigator may change their opinion of causality in light of follow-up information 
and send an SAE follow-up report with the upda ted causality assessment.  
• The causality assessment is 1 of the criteria used when determining regulatory reporting 
requirements.   
Follow-up of AE and SAE  
• The investigator is obligated to perform or arrange for the conduct of supplemental measurements and/o r evaluations as medically indicated or as requested by Sponsor to 
elucidate the nature and/or causality of the AE or SAE as fully as possible. This may include additional laboratory tests or investigations, histopathological examinations, or 
consultation with other health care professionals.   
• New or updated information will be recorded in the e CRF. 
• The investigator will submit any updated SAE data to the Sponsor within 24 hours of 
receipt of the information.  
10.3.5 Reporting of AEs , SAEs, and Other Reportable Safety Events to the Sponsor  
AE, SAE, and other reportable safety event reporting to Sponsor via e lectronic data 
collection tool 
• The primary mechanism for reporting to the Sponsor will be the EDC tool. 
- Electronic reporting procedures can be found in the EDC data entry guidelines (or 
equivalent). 
- If the electronic system is unavailable for more than 24 hours, then the site will use the paper AE Reporting form. 
◦ Reference Section 8.4.1 for reporting time requirements.  
• The site will enter the SAE data into the electronic system as soon as it becomes 
available.  
• After the study is completed at a given site, the EDC tool will be taken off- line to prevent 
the entry of new data or changes to existing data. 
• If a site receives a report of a new SAE from a study participant or receives updated data on a previously reported SAE after the EDC tool has been taken off-line, then the site can 
report this information on a paper SAE for m or by telephone (see next section).  
• Contacts for SAE reporting can be found in the Investigator Study File Binder (or 
equivalent).

SAE reporting to the Sponsor via p aper CRF  
• If the EDC tool is not operational, facsimile transmission or secure e -mail of the SAE 
paper CRF is the preferred method to transmit this information to the Sponsor.  
• In rare circumstances and in the absence of facsimile equipment, notification by 
telephone is acceptable with a copy of the SAE data collection tool sent by overnight mail or courier service.  
• Initial notification via telephone does not replace the need for the investigator to complete and sign the SAE CRF pages within the designated reporting time frames. 
• Contacts and instructions for SAE reporting and paper reporting procedures can be found 
in the Investigator Study File Binder (or equivalent).

Women of Nonchildbearing Potential (WONCBP)  
Women in the following categories are considered WONCBP:  
• Premenopausal female with 1 of the following: 
- Documented hysterectomy  
- Documented bilateral salpingectomy 
- Documented bilateral oophorectomy 
For individuals with permanent infertility due to an alternate medical cause other than 
the above (eg, Mullerian agenesis, androgen insensitivity), investigator discretion 
should be applied to determining study entry. 
Note:  Documentation can come from the site personnel’s review of the participant’s 
medical records, medical examination, or medical history interview.  
• Postmenopausal female 
- A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an alternative 
medical cause.  
◦ A high FSH level in the postmenopausal range may be used to confirm a 
postmenopausal state in women not using hormonal contraception or HRT. 
However, in the absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, confirmation with two 
FSH measurements in the postmenopausal range is required.  
- Females on HRT and whose menopausal status is in doubt must discontinue HRT to 
allow confirmation of postmenopausal status before study enrollment.

Research  
1. Definitions  
a. Biomarker: A biological molecule found in blood, other body fluids, or tissues that is a sign of a normal or abnormal process or of a condition or disease. A biomarker may 
be used to see how well the body responds to a treatment for a disea se or condition.
1  
b. Pharmacogenomics: The investigation of variations of DNA and RNA characteristics 
as related to drug/vaccine response.2 
c. Pharmacogenetics: A subset of pharmacogenomics, pharmacogenetics is the influence 
of variations in DNA sequence on drug/vaccine response.2 
d. DNA: Deoxyribonucleic acid. 
e. RNA: Ribonucleic acid.  
 
2. Scope of Future Biomedical Research3, 4 
The specimens consented and/or collected in this study as outlined in Section  8.9 will be 
used in various experiments to understand: 
• The biology of how drugs/vaccines work 
• Biomarkers responsible for how a drug/vaccine enters and is removed by the body 
• Other pathways with which drugs/vaccines may interact 
• The biology of disease 
The specimen(s) may be used for future assay development and/or drug/vaccine 
development. 
It is now well recognized that information obtained from studying and testing clinical 
specimens offers unique opportunities to enhance our understanding of how individuals respond to drugs/vaccines, enhance our understanding of human disease and ultimately 
improve public health through development of novel treatments targeted to populations 
with the greatest need. All specimens will be used by the Sponsor or those working for or 
with the Sponsor. 
3. Summary of Procedures for Future Biomedical Research
3, 4 
a. Participants for Enrollment  
All participants enrolled in the clinical study will be considered for enrollment in future biomedical research . 
b. Informed Consent  
Informed consent for specimens (ie, DNA, RNA, protein, etc) will be obtained during 
screening for protocol enrollment from all participants or legal guardians, at a study 
visit by the investigator or their designate. Informed consent for future biomedical 
research should be presented to the participants on the visit designated in the SoA. If 
delayed, present consent at next possible Participant Visit. Consent forms signed by

MK-6482-021-03 FINAL PROTOCOL  17-APR-2023 
 
 
the participant will be kept at the clinical study site under secu re storage for 
regulatory reasons.  
A template of each study site’s approved informed consent will be stored in the 
Sponsor’s clinical document repository. 
c. eCRF Documentation for Future Biomedical Research  Specimens 
Documentat ion of participant consent for future biomedical research  will be captured 
in the eCRFs. Any specimens for which such an informed consent cannot be verified 
will be destroyed. 
d. Future Biomedical Research  Specimen(s)  
Collection of specimens for future biomedical research  will be performed  as outlined 
in the SoA. In general, if additional blood specimens are being collected for future biomedical research , these will usually be obtained at a time when the participant is 
having blood drawn for other study purposes. 
4. Confidential Participant In formation for Future Biomedical Research
3, 4 
In order to optimize the research that can be conducted with future biomedical research  
specimens, it is critical to link participants ' clinical information with future test results. In 
fact, little or no resear ch can be conducted without connecting the clinical study data to 
the specimen. The clinical data allow specific analyses to be conducted. Knowing participant characteristics like sex, age, medical history and intervention outcomes are 
critical to understa nding clinical context of analytical results.  
To maintain privacy of information collect ed from specimens obtained for future 
biomedical research , the Sponsor has developed secure policies and procedures. All 
specimens will be single-coded per ICH E15 guidelines as described below.  
At the clinical study site, unique codes will be placed on the future biomedical research  
specimens. This code is a random number which does not contain any personally identifying information embedded within it. The link (or key) between participant identifiers and this unique code will be held at the study site. No personal identifiers will appear on the specimen tube. 
5. Biorepository Specimen Usage
3, 4 
Specimens obtained for the Sponsor will be used for analyses using good scientific practices. Analyses u sing the future biomedical research  specimens may be performed by 
the Sponsor, or an additional third party (eg, a university investigator) designated by the Sponsor. The investigator conducting the analysis will follow the Sponsor’s privacy and confidentiality requirements. Any contracted third party analyses will conform to the specific scope o f analysis outlined in future biomedical research  protocol and consent . 
Future biomedical research  specimens remaining with the third party after specific 
analysis is performed will be reported to the Sponsor.

6. Withdrawal From Future Biomedical Resea rch3, 4 
Participants may withdraw their consent for FBR and ask that their biospecimens not be 
used for FBR. Participants may withdraw consent at any time by contacting the study 
investigator. If medical records for the study are still available, the investigator will contact the Sponsor using the designated mailbox (clinical.specimen.management@ MSD.com). Subsequently, the participant's specimens 
will be flagged in the biorepository and restricted to study use only. If specimens were 
collected from study  participants specifically for FBR, these specimens will be removed 
from the biorepository and destroyed. Documentation will be sent to the investigator 
confirming withdrawal and/or destruction, if applicable. It is the responsibility of the 
investigator to inform the participant of completion of the withdrawal and/or destruction, 
if applicable. Any analyses in progress at the time of request for withdrawal/destruction 
or already performed before the request being received by the Sponsor will continue to be 
used as part of the overall research study data and results. No new analyses would be 
generated after the request is received.  
If the medical records for the study are no longer available (eg, if the investigator is no 
longer required by regulatory authoriti es to retain the study records) or the specimens 
have been completely anonymized, there will no longer be a link between the 
participant’s personal information and their specimens. In this situation, the request for withdrawal of consent and/or destruction cannot be processed. 
7. Retention of Specimens
3, 4 
Future biomedical research  specimens will be stored in the biorepository for potential 
analysis for up to 20 years from the end of the study. Specimens may be stored for longer if a regulatory or governmental authority has active questions that are being answered. In this special circumstance, specimens will be stored until these questions have been 
adequately addressed. 
Specimens from the study site will be shipped to a central laboratory and then shipped to 
the Sponsor- designated biorepository. If a central laboratory is not utilize d in a particular 
study, the study site will ship directly to the Sponsor-designated biorepository. The specimens will be stored under strict supervision in a limited access facility which 
operates to assure the integrity of the specimens. Specimens will be destroyed according to Sponsor policies and procedures and this destruction will be documented in the biorepository database. 
8. Data Security
3, 4 
Databases containing specimen information and test results are accessible only to the authorized Sponsor representatives and the designated study administrator research personnel and/or collaborators. Database user authentication is highly secure, and is accomplished using network security policies and practices based on international standards to protect against unauthorized access.

9. Reporting of Future Biomedical Research Data to Participants3, 4 
No information obtained from exploratory laboratory studies will be reported to the 
participant, family, or physicians. Principle reasons not to inform or return results to the participant include: lack of relevance to participant health, limitations of predictive 
capability, and concerns regarding misinterpretation. 
If important research fin dings are discovered, the Sponsor may publish results, present 
results in national meetings, and make results accessible on a public website in order to  
rapidly report this information to doctors and participants. Participants will not be 
identified by name in any published reports about this study or in any other scientific publication or presentation. 
10. Future Biomedical Research Study Population
3, 4 
Every effort will be made to recruit all participants diagnosed and treated o n Sponsor 
clinical studies for future biomedical research . 
11. Risks Versus Benefits of Future Biomedical Research3, 4 
For future biomedical research , risks to the participant have been mini mized and are 
described in the future biomedical research  informed consent. 
The Sponsor has developed strict security, policies, and procedures to address participant 
data privacy concerns. Data privacy risks are largely limited to rare situations involving 
possible breach of confidentiality. In this highly unlikely situation, there is risk that the information, like all medical information, may be misused. 
12. Questions  
Any questions related to the future biomedical research  should be e mailed directly to 
clinical.specimen.management@MSD .com.

10.9 Appendix 9: Algorithm for Assessing Out of Range Laboratory Values 
For all laboratory values obtained at prestudy (screening) visit and/or predose evaluation: 
A. If all protocol-specified laboratory values are normal, the participant may enter the study. 
B. If a protocol specified laboratory value is outside of the parameter(s) outlined in the 
inclusion/exclusion criteria (including a repeat if performed), the participant will be 
excluded from the study. 
C. If ≥1 protocol- specified laboratory value not specified in the inclusion/exclusion criteria 
is outside the normal range, the following choices are available:  
a. The participant may be excluded from the study. 
b. The participant may be included in the study if the abnormal value(s) is NCS (the 
investigator must annotate the laboratory value “NCS” on the laboratory safety 
test source d ocument). 
c. The participant may be included in the study if the abnormality is consistent with a pre-existing medical condition which is not excluded per protocol (eg, elevated 
eosinophil count in a participant with asthma or seasonal allergies), the medical  
condition should be annotated on the laboratory report. 
OR 
d. The abnormal test may be repeated (refer items a. and b. below for continuation of algorithm for repeated values).  
a. If the repeat test value is within the normal range, the participant may enter the study. 
b. If the repeat test value is still abnormal, the study investigator will evaluate the potential participant with a complete history and physical examination, looking especially for diseases that could result in the abnormal laboratory value in ques tion. If such diseases can be ruled out, 
and if the abnormal laboratory value is not clinically relevant, then the participant may enter the study. 
D. If there is any clinical uncertainty regarding the significance of an abnormal value, the participant will be excluded from the study.

ABSTRACT  
Context:  Ivacaftor has been a  novel FDA approved therapy for patients with CF and gating 
mutations who are 2 years and older.  The FDA has recently approved Ivacaftor for use in 
children 6 months of age and above. Our Investigator Initiated Study is designed to 
evaluate the nutritional, growth and GI impact of ivacaftor treatment for this unique younger 
(6 month s to 2 years ) patient cohort and for whom FDA approval for treatment is  now 
approved . This proposal directly extends our previous highly informative nutrition and 
weight gain investigation of ivacaftor treatment in the older patient cohort.  
Objectives : The primary aims of the study are to evaluate the impact of 12 weeks of 
ivacaftor treatment in 6 month  to 2 year old  subjects with CF and gating mutati ons growth 
status and gut health and function in n=18 children with protocol evaluations at baseline 
(pre-treatment) and 6 and 12 weeks after clinically prescribed ivacaftor treatment has 
begun . Other outcomes of significant clinical interest in young pati ents with CF will be 
explored. All subjects will be evaluated at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, and will 
be recruited both regionally and nationally to ensure timely enrollment.  
Study Design : Observational prospective study with evaluations befo re and after 12 weeks 
of ivacaftor treatment.   An interim assessment at 6 weeks will also be included.  
Setting/Participants : Eighteen subjects ages 6 month s  to 2 years  of age cystic fibrosis and 
CFTR gating mutations who are in a general state of good health from cystic fibrosis 
centers  in US and Canada .  
Study Interventions and Measures : Subjects will be evaluated before and after ivacaftor 
treatment for sleeping energy expenditure, BMI Z score , gut health and function  as 
indicated by plasma fatty acid s, fecal elastase and fecal calprotectin .  Dietary intake, growth 
status and velocity, and serum fat soluble vitamins, bile acids and calprotectin will also be 
assessed.

PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS  
Study Title  Nutritional Impact of Ivacaftor Treatment in 6 month  to 2 Year  Old 
Children with CF Gating Mutations   
Funder  Vertex Pharmaceutical and CHOP Center for Human Phenomic 
Science and Nutrition Center  
Study Rationale       Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disease caused by mutations in 
the gene encoding the CF transmembrane conductance regulator 
(CFTR), a chloride channel in many types of cells. Most CF 
mutations either reduce the number of CFTR channels at the cell 
surface (synthesis and processing mutations) or impair channel 
function (gating or conductance mutations).  Ivacaftor (Kalydeco®, 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc.) was the first of a new class of drugs 
that improved CFTR gating dysfunction1-3.  For such mutations 
(G551D, G178R, S549N, S549R,  G551S, G970R, G1244E, 
S1251N, S1255P, G1349D) that permit CFTR expression at the cell 
membrane but compromise its activity, ivacaftor increases the 
probability that the chloride channel is open and active.  In 
randomized, double -blind, placebo controlled trials, ivacaftor 
treatment in individuals (ages 6 to adulthood) with at least one 
G551D mutation resulted in clinically significant improvements in 
weight and body mass index (BMI), pulmonary function, and patient 
reported quality of life outcomes (QOL)3,4.  Lung function and 
weight changes occurred over eight weeks, then plateaued and 
were sustained over 48 weeks.  
     In the initial trials ivacaftor treatment in indi viduals with at least 
one G551D mutation resulted in rapid and sustained weight gain, 
increased FEV 1%, decreased pulmonary exacerbations, decreased 
sweat chloride concentration reflective of increased CFTR activity, 
and improved patient reported health -related QOL outcomes3-5. 
Ivacaftor has shown similar benefit in younger children and has 
been approved for use in children 6 months of age and older . 
Ivacaftor was found to be safe and effective in 33 children in the 
KIWI study completed 24 weeks of treatment in the KIWI study, 
with significant reductions in sweat chloride concentration, and an 
average increase in weight Z score of 0.2±0.3 and BMI z score of 
0.4±0.46.  Some exocrine pancreatic function restoration was 
demonstrated in these young children, as  Davies et al.6 
     In our recent longitudi nal observational study of 23 subjects 
(ages 5 to 61 years), we identified several mechanisms for weight 
gain with 3 -month ivacaftor treatment including decreased resting 
energy expenditure (REE), gut inflammation and dietary fat 
malabsorption, resulting i n a positive energy balance and weight 
gain. Weight gain in this study was 2.5 kg and was associated with 
a significant decrease in REE percent predicted of 5.5%, and in 
fecal calprotectin of 30 ug/g stool, a measure of gut inflammation7-9. 
     Several outcomes related to improved energy balance are 
considered in this proposal. Building on our results in older 
    
   
18-015299                                                                                                               10/28 /2019   vii 
subjects, we will once again focus on the importance of  determining 
the effect of ivacaftor treatment on clinically important non -
pulmonary outcomes. Our primary aim in this study of young 6 
month   to 2 year old children is to determine if 12 -week ivacaftor 
treatment results in decreased sleeping energy expend iture (REE) 
and improved growth status by BMI Z score . Our secondary aim is 
to determine improvement in gut health and function associated 
with fat digestion, including increased total plasma fatty acids and 
fecal elastase, and decreased fecal calprotectin .  Exploratory aims 
include investigating the impact of ivacaftor treatment on dietary 
intake, length, weight and head circumference status and growth 
velocity, and on serum fat soluble vitamins, bile acids and 
calprotectin.    
Study Objective(s)       We propose a longitudinal study design to determine whether 12 
weeks of treatment with ivacaftor results in improvement in sleeping 
energy expenditure (SEE), growth status as BMI Z score, and gut 
health and function in n=18 children ages 6 months   to 2 yea rs with 
at least one CFTR gating mutation. We anticipate that these 
changes will accompany meaningful improvements in dietary 
intake, growth status and growth velocity, and serum fat soluble 
vitamins, bile acids and serum calprotectin in these young childr en.       
 
PRIMARY AIMS  
H1:  Ivacaftor treatment will result in a significant reduction in SEE 
as percent predicted over 12 weeks compared to baseline, thereby 
increasing the energy available for weight gain and physical 
activity.  
H2: Ivacaftor treatment w ill result in significantly increased BMI Z 
score over 12 weeks compared to baseline.  
SECONDARY AIMS  
H3:  Ivacaftor treatment will result in significantly improved gut 
health and function resulting in better dietary fat absorption as 
indicated by increased  total plasma fatty acids and fecal elastase 
and decreased fecal calprotectin over 12 weeks compared to 
baseline.  
EXPLORATORY AIMS  
To determine the impact of ivacaftor treatment over 12 weeks 
compared to baseline in:  
 Dietary intake of calories and percent calories from fat  
 Growth status for length, weight, head circumference and 
growth velocity  
 Serum fat soluble vitamins A, D, E and K, bile acids, and 
serum calprotectin  
Study Design  
 We propose a longitudinal study design to assess sleeping energy 
expenditure, improvement in BMI Z score, and improved gut health 
and function in n=18 children ages 6 months   to 2 years with CF

count and serum pre-albumin will be assessed (CHOP Clinical 
Laboratory).  
Dosing will likely be interrupted by the CF clinical care team in 
subjects with ALT or AST of greater than 5 times the upper limit of 
normal (ULN).  
Subjects will be as ked about all adverse events at the 6 and 12 
week protocol visits and during the bi -weekly phone calls, and rate d 
by intensity (mild, moderate, severe). Serious adverse events will 
be reported as per various policies  in a timely manner to CHOP IRB  
and CHPS.  
 
Statistical And 
Analytic Plan  Primary Aims:  The goals of the primary aims of this study are to 
determine whether  ivacaftor treatment improves SEE and BMI Z 
score. Secondary Aims:  The goal of the secondary aim is to 
determine whether ivacaftor improves gut health and function as 
measured by total  plasma fatty acids, fecal elastase and fecal 
calprotectin  (ug/g stool) . Analysis of efficacy for the primary and 
secondary outcomes will be based on change from baseline (before 
treatment) in SEE% predicted (Schofield), BMI Z scores, total 
plasma fatty acids, fecal elastase and fecal calprotectin. The 
differences between baseline and 12 weeks continuous outcomes 
will initially be compared u sing paired -t-tests if continuous variables 
are normally distributed and nonparametric tests (Wilcoxon sign 
rank) if they are not. Subsequently, mixed effects longitudinal 
models will be performed to assess change over all three time 
points (baseline, 6 an d 12 weeks), adjusting for potential covariates 
such as age, sex, and adherence to treatment. Chi -squared tests 
will be used for comparison of categorical variables before and after 
ivacaftor treatment. Using similar methods, exploratory analyses 
will exam ine improvement in dietary intake of calories and fat, in 
growth status (weight, length, and head circumference Z scores) 
and growth velocity (both absolute and Z scores), serum fat soluble 
vitamins, bile acids, and calprotectin.   
DATA AND SAFETY 
MONITOR ING PLAN Safety will be formerly monitored weekly by the study team. The 
study protocol will be carried out in accordance with OHRP 
guidelines and requirements. SAEs that are unanticipated, serious, 
and possibly related to the study intervention will be reported to the 
study sponsor, IRB, CHPS, and members of the research and 
clinical teams in accordance with requirements. Anticipated SAEs 
or those unrelated to the study intervention will be reported to the 
same individuals/entities in accordance with req uirements. There 
will be ongoing collection of data on adverse events and 
compliance to the treatment protocol throughout the study by 
research staff and which will be summarized and reviewed monthly 
by the study Principal Investigator and the Study Team.  Out of 
range non -clinically significant laboratory data will be reviewed 
continually by the PI and the study team.

1 BACKGROUND INFORMATI ON AND RATIONALE  
1.1 Introduction  
 Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disease caused by mutations in the gene encoding the CF 
transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), a chloride channel in many types of cells. 
Most CF mutations either reduce the number of CFTR channels at the cell surfac e 
(synthesis and processing mutations) or impair channel function (gating or conductance 
mutations). Ivacaftor (Kalydeco®, Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc.) was the first of a new class 
of drugs that improved CFTR gating dysfunction1-3.  For such mutations (G551D, G178R, 
S549N, S549R, G551S, G970R, G1244E, S1251N, S1255 P, G1349D) that permit CFTR 
expression at the cell membrane but compromise its activity, ivacaftor increases the 
probability that the chloride channel is open and active.  In randomized, double -blind, 
placebo controlled trials, ivacaftor treatment in indiv iduals (ages 6 to adulthood) with at 
least one G551D mutation resulted in clinically significant improvements in weight and body 
mass index (BMI), pulmonary function, and patient reported quality of life outcomes 
(QOL)3,4.  Lung function and weight changes occurred over eight weeks, then plateaued 
and were sustained over 48 weeks.  
In the initial trials ivacaftor treatment in individuals with at least one G551D mutation 
resulted in rapid and sustained weight gain, increased FEV 1%, decreased pulmonary 
exacerbations, decreased sweat chloride concentration reflective of increased CFTR 
activity, and improved patient reported health -related QOL outcomes3-5.   In the STRIVE 
study of 161 adolescents and adults (12+ years old), subjects gained 3.1 kg after 48 weeks 
of treatment compared to 0.4 kg for those on placebo3.  In the ENVISION study of 52 
younger growing children (6 to 11 years old)4, subjects gained 3.7 kg after 24 weeks of 
ivacaftor vs.1.8 kg for placebo. In both studies, weight gain and improved lung function 
occurred rapidly with a weight plateau by 16 weeks or earlier. In people with non -G551 
gating mutations (KONNECTION study, 6+ years old)10, BMI Z scores improved 0.24 after 
eight weeks of treatment compared to -0.04 for placebo.  A long term ivacaftor o pen-label 
phase that followed the STRIVE and ENVISION studies (PERSIST study)11 as well as 
observational studies have shown persistence and stabili ty of weight gain and improvement 
in nutritional status over two or more years12,13. 
Ivacaftor has shown similar benefit in younger children and has been approved for use in  
children 6 months and older. . Ivacaftor was  found to be safe and effective in 33 children in 
the KIWI study completed 24 weeks of treatment in the KIWI study, with significant 
reductions in sweat chloride concentration, and an average increase in weight Z score of 
0.2±0.3 and BMI z score of 0.4±0.46.  Some exocrine pancreatic function restor ation was 
demonstrated in these young children, as Davies et al.6 noted an increase in fecal elastase 
concentrations in a small sample of children  after 24 weeks ivacaftor treatment.  Prior to 
treatment, 93% were PI with fecal elastase concentrations of <50 µg/g, and after treatment 
this increased 100 µg/g on average.  Furthermore, in the KLIMB study, a long -term follow -
up to the KIWI study, the inc reased fecal elastase concentrations were sustained with mean 
increase of 129 µg/g after 84 weeks of treatment14.  These results suggest that exocrine 
pancreatic function early in life may be partially restored with ivacaftor6,15.   
In a recent open -label Phase 3 trial  (the ARRIVAL study)16,17 in 18 children ages 1 to 2 
years of age with CFTR gating mutations (G551D, G178R, S549N, S549R, G551S, 
   
   
18-015299                                                                                                               10/28 /2019   2 
G1244E, S1251N, S1255P, G1439D, or R117H) who completed 24 -weeks of treatment, 
ivacaftor was safe and effective in significantly reducing swe at chloride concentrations from 
104.1 to 31.5 mmol/L, and improving (restoring) pancreatic function as indicated by 
increasing fecal elastase from 182 to 357 ug/g stool. Ivacaftor’s impact on growth status or 
velocity for weight and BMI in these young chil dren was not reported. Changes in energy 
expenditure with ivacaftor treatment in these young children has also not yet been explored. 
This current application will directly ddress gaps in knowledge related to the important non -
pulmonary outcomes that are c linically very important in very young children.   
     In our recent longitudinal observational study of 23 subjects (ages 5 to 61 years), we 
identified several mechanisms for weight gain with 3 -month ivacaftor treatment including 
decreased resting energy  expenditure (REE), gut inflammation and dietary fat 
malabsorption, resulting in a positive energy balance and weight gain. Weight gain in this 
study was 2.5 kg and was associated with a significant decrease in REE percent predicted 
of 5.5%, and in fecal c alprotectin of 30 ug/g stool, a measure of gut inflammation7-9. For the 
16 subjects with PI, dietary fat absorption as measured by coefficient of fat absorption 
(CFA) improved 3%7,8,18.  Dietary fat intake increased significantly in all subjects7, and 
energy intake increased, particularly in those from Italy8.  In subjects <20 years of age, 
improved weight and BMI status was accompanied by beneficial effects on muscle mass, 
muscle function and QOL. Improvement in pancreatic function (fecal elastase) was seen in 
5 of 7 subjects with PS. Whether a simil ar improvement in REE, growth status and gut 
health and function related to improved fat absorption in young children with CFTR gating 
mutations is not known.  
     Several outcomes related to improved energy balance are considered in this proposal. 
Buildin g on our results in older subjects, we will once again focus on the importance of 
determining the effect of ivacaftor treatment on clinically important non -pulmonary 
outcomes. Our primary aim in this study of young 6 month  to 2 year old children is to 
determine if 12 -week ivacaftor treatment results in decreased sleeping energy expenditure 
(REE) and improved growth status by BMI Z score. Our secondary aim is to determine 
improvement in gut health and function associated with fat  digestion, including increased 
total plasma fatty acids and fecal elastase, and decreased fecal calprotectin.  Exploratory 
aims include investigating the impact of ivacaftor treatment on dietary intake, length, weight 
and head circumference status and gro wth velocity, and on serum fat soluble vitamins, bile 
acids and calprotectin.   
   In addition to reduced dietary fat absorption, altered fatty acid metabolism has been 
shown in CF and PI19,20, and may be linked to CFTR dysfunction, and little is known of 
changes with CFTR modulator treatment. In the GOAL study, change in serum fatty acid 
concentrations with ivacaftor treatment were explored. Serum arachi donic acid levels 
decreased while linoleic and docosahexenoic acid levels did not change in 40 subjects with 
G551D CFTR mutation21. We previously demonstrated a significant increase in total plasma 
fatty acids from 8.5±1.6 to 10.2±3.6 mmol/L (P<0.01) with 3 -month treatment of a fat -based 
nutritional supplement: linoleic, lauric, palmitoleic, oleic and docosatetraenoic acids all 
significantly increased as well19. We propose to assess a plasma fatty acid panel that 
includes concentrations for 22 individual fatty acids a s well as total fatty acids, as an 
indicator of change in fat absorption.  
   Serum calprotectin is a marker for whole body inflammation including lung and gut 
inflammation in CF, and other chronic inflammatory diseases22-24, and will be assessed 
along with fecal calprotec tin. Improvements in length, weight and head circumference 
status will likely result from an expected reduction in SEE in these children associated with 
   
   
18-015299                                                                                                               10/28 /2019   3 
ivacaftor treatment. Furthermore, comparisons of metabolic profiles in children with CF and 
their healt hy counterparts, showed that the children with CF had profiles indicating bile acid 
processing abnormalities25.  Whether ivacaftor treatment results in improved fatty acid 
profiles, gut and systemic inflammation (fecal and serum calprotectin), bile ac ids and fat 
soluble vitamin status as markers of improved fat absorption in young children with CFTR 
gating mutations is not known and represent novel and clinically meaningful outcomes in 
young children with CF.  
We propose a longitudinal study design to d etermine whether 12 weeks of treatment with 
ivacaftor results in improvement in SEE, growth status as BMI Z score, and gut health and 
function in 18 children ages 6 months  to 2 years with at least one CFTR gating mutation. 
There will be a mid -treatment evaluation at 6 weeks to explore the pace of the change in 
the primary and secondary outcomes. To plan the study, we assume that 1/3 of subjects 
will be recruited locally within a  150 mile radius of Philadelphia and the remaining 2/3 from 
other CF Centers in North America and will travel to Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia 
(CHOP) for three protocol visits, each visit lasting 2 or 3  days, conducted at our Center for 
Human Phenomi c Science (CHPS) and Nutrition and Growth Laboratory.  
The primary aims  of this study are to determine whether ivacaftor treatment reduces SEE 
and increases BMI Z score.  Secondary aims  are to determine if ivacaftor treatment 
improves gut health and functio n resulting in better fat absorption as indicated by increased 
total plasma fatty acids and fecal elastase, and decreased fecal calprotectin. Exploratory 
aims  are to examine the impact on dietary intake, growth status and velocity, serum fat 
soluble vitami ns, serum bile acids, and serum calprotectin as a measure of systemic 
inflammation.   
 
1.2 Compliance Statement  
This study will be conducted in full accordance all applicable Children’s Hospital of 
Philadelphia Research Policies and Procedures and all applicable Federal and state laws 
and regulations including 45 CFR 46 .  All episodes of noncompliance will be documented.  
The investigators will perform the study in accordance with this protocol, will obtain consent  
and will report unanticipated problems involving risks to subjects or others in accordance 
with The Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia IRB Policies and Procedures and all federal 
requirements. Collection, recording, and reporting of data will be accurate and will ensure 
the privacy, health, an d welfare of research subjects during and after the study.  
2 STUDY OBJECTIVES  
We propose a longitudinal study design to determine whether 12 weeks of treatment with 
ivacaftor results in improvement in sleeping energy expenditure (SEE), growth status as 
BMI Z score, and gut health and function in n=18 children ages 6 months  to 2 years with at 
least one CFTR gating mutation. We anticipate that these changes will ac company 
meaningful improvements  in dietary intake, growth status and growth velocity, and serum 
fat soluble vitamins, bile acids and serum calprotectin in these young childr en.

2.1 Primary Aims  
H1:  Ivacaftor treatment will result in a significant reduction in SEE as percent predicted 
over 12 weeks compared to baseline, thereby increasing the energy available for weight 
gain and physical activity.  
H2: Ivacaftor treatment w ill result in significantly increased BMI Z score over 12 weeks 
compared to baseline.  
2.2 Secondary  Aims 
H3:  Ivacaftor treatment will result in significantly improved gut health and function resulting 
in better dietary fat absorption as indicated by increased  total plasma fatty acids and fecal 
elastase and decreased fecal calprotectin over 12 weeks compared to baseline. To 
determine if treatment with Ivacaftor results in increased dietary fat absorption using three 
methods:  
2.3 Exploratory Aims  
1) To determine the imp act of ivacaftor treatment over 12 weeks compared to baseline in:  
a) Dietary intake of calories and percent calories from fat  
b) Growth status for length, weight, head circumference and growth velocity  
c) Serum fat soluble vitamins A, D, E and K, bile acids, and calprotectin  
3 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
3.1 General Schema of Study Design  
3.1.1  Screening Phase  
Subjects (n=18) will be recruited to participate in the study from a pool of subjects with at 
least one CFTR gating mutation .  Given our previous success in enrolling subjects  with CF 
from both local CF Centers and more distant Centers who traveled considerable distances 
to participate in our research protocols, we expect that enrollment will be achieved in a 
timely fashion. The plan to initiate treatment and the clinical eligi bility for treatment is 
determined by the subject’s family and the CF care team.  
Potential subjects will be screened using the protocol inclusion and exclusion criteria.  The 
CF Center s around the country and Canada  will provide the study with resources that will 
aide in recruitment efforts (i.e. to help to identify subjects with “gating” mutations) . The 
subject’s CF care team will be contacted to confirm eligibility for the study and this will 
include obtaining medical information from the team and subje ct’s medical record.  To 
collect medical data for screening purposes, a verbal or in person consent from 
parents/guardians will be obtained.  
Parental/guardian permission (informed consent) will be obtained prior to any study rel ated 
procedures being perform ed.  
3.1.2  Study Enrollment  Phase  
Eligible subjects will be enrolled into the study and come to CHOP for the study visits. Refer 
to Table 1 for list of assessments and the study timeline for the pace of recruitment.  
3.1.3  Follow -up Phase  
Their initial baseline visit (Visit 1) will occur before clinicall y prescribed ivacaftor treatment 
has begun . The exact date of the start of medication will vary for families as they obtain 
   
   
18-015299                                                                                                               10/28 /2019   5 
their medication.  Subjects will return to CHOP for the 6 week visit (Visit 2) and the 12 week  
visit (Visit 3 and final) after subject /family  has confirmed the timing of the start of ivacaftor 
treatment . There may be a delay between the baseline visit and the 6 week visit based 
upon when treatment begins. For most families, the total duration of the  study will be from 4 
to 6 months. The duration of the study from start of ivacaftor treatment until last study visit 
will be 12 weeks.  For each of the 6 and 12 week visits following the start of ivacaftor 
treatment, there will be a window of ±2 weeks for  the visit to occur (i.e. 6 week visit may 
occur between 4 and 8 weeks, and 12 week visit between 10 and 14 weeks post ivacaftor 
treatment).   
Refer to Table 1 for list of assessments and the study timeline for the visit schedule.  
3.2 Study Duration, Enrollment and Number of Sites  
3.2.1  Duration of Study Participation  
The study duration for subject  participation from enrollment to the last study visit will range 
from 4 to 6 months . The baseline visit will occur prior to the start of ivacaftor treatment.  
From  the start of the clinically prescribed ivacaftor treatment to the last study visit will be 12 
weeks  with a window of ±2 weeks . 
3.2.2  Total Number of Study Sites/Total Number of Subjects Projected  
The study will be conducted at one investigative site  in the Unit ed States.  
Recruitment will stop when 18 subjects are enrolled.  It is expected that 18 subjects will be 
enrolled to produce 16 evaluable subjects.  
3.3 Study Population  
3.3.1  Inclusion Criteria  
 Cystic fibrosis with  at least one CFTR gating mutation of these ten ( G551D, G178R, 
S549N, S549R, G551S, G1244E, S1251N, S1255P, G1439D, or R117H).  
 Age: 6 months to 2 years of age  
 In their usual state of good health  
 A clinical decision has been made for subject to begin ivacaftor treatment.  
 Family committed to the 4 to 6 month stu dy protocol with visits to CHOP that will last 
2-3 days for the baseline  visit (Visit 1)  prior to ivacaftor treatment  and the 12 week  
visit (Visit 3) after clinically prescribed ivacaftor treatment has begun , and will last up 
to 2 days for the 6 week  visit (Visit 2) after ivacaftor treatment has begun . 
 Note that ivacaftor is now approved by the FDA for 6 month  to 2 year old children 
for the additional 28 CFTR mutations known to be responsive to ivacaftor 
potentiation, these will also be co nsidered. With our limited sample size, the 
mutations that have shown the strongest improvement with treatment will be given 
priority for enrollment.  
3.3.2  Exclusion Criteria  
 On parenteral nutrition  
 Use of any inhibitor or inducer medications  of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A

4 STUDY PROCEDURES  
4.1 Screening  
Subjects will be screened using the protocol inclusion and exclusion criteria.  Written (in  
person) or v erbal (via phone) parental/guardian permission will be obtained prior to 
scheduling any study screening related procedures . Informed written consent  will be 
obtained at the baseline visit  prior to conducting any research procedures.   
All subjects will be enrolled in their usual state of good health defined as no 
hospitalizations, emergency room or unscheduled acute illness clinic visits, and with activ ity 
levels and food intake considered typical by the subject and their care provider for two or 
four weeks prior to the baseline visit .    
4.2 Observational Period  
Many of the protocol assessments could occur  on any of the visit days (i.e. questionnaires, 
spot stool sample) . Below is the best estimate of how each day will proceed. The baseline 
(Visit 1) and the 12 week (Visit 3) visit after ivacaftor treatment has begun  are nearly 
identical with the exception of obtaining informed consent which will occur at Visit 1 Day 1 
prior to any assessments being done or specimens being collected.  For the 6 week (Visit 
2) and 12 week (Visit 3) visits that will occur after confirmation of the timing of the start of 
clinicall y prescribed ivacaftor treatment, there will be a ±2 week window for the visit. (i.e. 6 
week visit may occur between 4 and 8 weeks, and 12 week visit between 10 and 14 weeks 
post ivacaftor treatment).   
The description provided here applies to subjects who are not local to CHOP and who will 
be traveling to Philadelphia from other regions of the US and Canada and staying at a local 
hotel for one  or two  night s depending on the time of their scheduled research procedures.  
For non-regional families , Day 1 of eac h Visit is the day of arrival to CHOP and first night of 
their hotel stay.  
If the subject is local to CHOP, we will still require a Day 1 visit for in -person written consent 
for Visit 1, however, for Visits 2 and 3, Days 1 and 2 can be combined to compl ete study 
protocol procedures,  and they will come in to CHOP from home for the major study protocol 
days: Day 2 for Visit 2 and Day 2 and again on Day 3 (if needed) for Visit 3.

may also withdraw subjects who violate the study plan, or to protect the subject for reasons 
of safety o r for administrative reasons.  It will be documented whether or not each subject 
completes the clinical study. If the Investigator becomes aware of any serious, related 
adverse events after the subject completes or withdraws from the study, they will be 
recorded in the source documents and on the CRF.  
5 STUDY EVALUATIONS AN D MEASUREMENTS  
5.1.1  Medical Record Review  
Variables that may be abstracted from the medical chart (paper or electronic) : 
 Date of birth  
 Sex 
 CF genotype  
 Medications  
 History of liver disease, CF related diabetes , GI disease or abdominal surgery  
5.1.2  Laboratory Evaluations  
Plasma Total Fatty Acids: A total plasma fatty acid panel will be assessed (ARUP 
Laboratories) to measure change  in status of 22 fatty acids.  
Fat Soluble Vitamins : Serum vitamin A and vitamin E assessed at Craft Technologies 
Laboratories. Serum vitamin D determined using Liquid Chromatography -Tandem Mass 
Spectrometry (CHOP).  As a measure of vitamin K status, % undercarboxylated osteocalcin 
(Gundberg Lab, Yale Univ ersity) will be assessed.  
Serum Bile Acids:  Total serum bile acids and 14 bile acid concentrations will be assessed 
by liquid chromatography tandem mass s pectrometry (ARUP Laboratories)  
Serum Calprotectin: Serum calprotectin will be obtained as a marker of lung and gut 
inflammation22,23 using a Buhlmann MRP8/14 ELISA kit (Alpco,  Salem, NH)).  
Safety Assessment : As part of safety assessment, a comprehensive metabolic panel 
including the ALT and AST liver enzymes, complete blood count and serum pre-albumin will 
be assessed (CHOP Clinical Laboratory).  
   
   
18-015299                                                                                                               10/28 /2019   10 
5.1.3  Study Assessments  
Sleeping Energy Expenditure:  The primary outcome for the assessment of energy 
expenditure is sleeping energy expenditure (SEE). Using indirect calorimetry, SEE and 
respiratory quotient will be assessed using a computerized metabolic cart Vmax ENCORE 
at each protoco l visit while the child is asleep. SEE will be assessed in the morning if 
possible and careful note of previous feeding of the child, including the time of day, amount 
of food, and feeding interval prior to test.  SEE is compared to predicted values derive d 
from the World Health Organization that adjust for age, sex and weight26 and Schofield 
equations that adjust for age, sex, weight and length27.  SEE as kcal/d will also be assessed 
by adjusting for both fat free mass (FFM) and fat  mass (FM) obtained from skinfold 
measurements. Anthropometric Assessment : The outcomes for weight gain, growth and 
nutritional status will be length, weight, BMI, and head circumference Z scores. Measures of 
body composition will also be conducted to dete rmine relative muscle and fat stores. All 
anthropometric techniques will follow those described by Lohman et al28. Weight (0.1 kg) 
will be measured on a digital electronic scale (Seca, Munich, Germany), length (0.1 c m) on 
an infantometer, (Holtain, Crymych, UK), and head circumference (0.1 cm) using an 
insertion tape. Skinfold thickness will be measured (0.1 mm) at the triceps, biceps, 
subscapular, and supra -iliac sites with a skinfold caliper (Holtain, Crymych, UK) t o assess 
subcutaneous fat stores. Mid upper arm circumference measured with a non -stretchable 
fiberglass tape (0.1 cm) (McCoy, Maryland Heights, MO). All measurements will be used to 
generate age -sex-specific Z scores for length,  weight, BMI, head circumf erence, arm 
circumference, triceps and subscapular skinfolds using WHO reference data29,30.  Z scores 
for growth velocity will also be calculated for the 12 week period using the WHO reference 
data31, and will provide a novel approach  to growth response.  
Body Composition : Total body composition, total FFM and FM and percent body fat (%FAT) 
and regional fat deposition, will be assessed by skinfold measurements.  
Fecal Elastase I:  Pancreatic function will be assessed at both visits by obtaining spot stool 
samples with fecal elastase 1 to determine the level of pancreatic enzyme activity32,33. 
Subjects wi ll be provided with the stool collection kit and proper instructions and supplies, 
and will bring a stool sample back the next day. The stool sample will be stored at -20oC, 
and analyzed with an enzyme -linked immunosorbent assay kit sent to ARUP Laboratory  
(Salt Lake City, UT).  
Fecal Calprotectin : Spot stool samples will be obtained to determine fecal calprotectin, a 
marker for gut inflammation (CHOP Laboratories), determined using a QUANTA Lite® 
ELISA kit.  
Dietary Intake : Three day weighed food record will  be obtained and calories, macro - and 
micro -nutrient content averaged over the three days. Families will be trained by staff and 
provided with scales, spoons and all supplies necessary for the collection of the dietary 
data.  Detailed verbal and written in structions will be provided to ensure that the recording 
procedures are clearly understood. Also assisting with this will come from the Center for 
Human Phenomic Science (CHPS) staff and Bionutrition Unit system34,35. Dietary intake of 
all nutrients will be analyzed using Nutrition Data System for Research software version 
2012 developed by the National Coordinating Center (NCC, University of Minnesota. 
Minneapolis, MN)36.   
Health Questionnaire : The questionnaire will be administered by interview by the research 
staff, and will consist of two sections. The Health History  section has general questi ons 
about the subject’s health history including documentation of medical history, recent 
hospital admissions and illnesses, medications, and nutrient supplement use. A section 
describes aspects of environment  such  household size , insurance for child and w hether on

Medicaid.  In addition to family contact information (name, address, phone numbers), 
contact information from two non -household contacts will be collected to maintain contact 
with the subject in the event that the family cannot be contacted at the ir primary residence.  
Adherence:  Questionnaire at the 6 and 12 week in  person visit regarding adherence to 
treatment will be administered. Phone calls will be made to all families at the 3 and 9 week 
time points and at the 12 -week in  person visit after iva caftor treatment has begun to 
assess adherence to treatment, to trouble -shoot any barriers to adherence, and also to 
collect information on adverse events experienced within the past four weeks.  Adherence 
to treatment with ivacaftor treatment and pancreat ic enzyme medication use will be 
assessed.  
Adverse Events  Calendar : Families will be asked about all adverse events for their child at 
the 12 week protocol visit and during the phone calls  at 3 and 9 weeks , and rate by intensity 
(mild, moderate, severe). Serious adverse events will be reported as per various policies in 
a timely manner to CHOP IRB, and CHPS.  
5.2 Safety Evaluation  
As part of safety assessment, a comprehensive metabolic panel including the ALT a nd AST 
liver enzymes, complete blood count and serum pre-albumin will be assessed (CHOP 
Clinical Laboratory).  
Dosing will likely be interrupted  by the CF clinical care team  in subjects with ALT or AST of 
greater than 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) .  
Subjects will be asked about all adverse events at the 6 and 12 week  protocol visits and 
during the phone calls  at 3 and 9 weeks , and rate by intensity (mild, moderate, severe). 
Serious adverse events will be reported as per various policies in a timely  manner to CHOP 
IRB, and C HPS. 
6 STATISTICAL CONSIDER ATIONS  
6.1 Statistical Methods  
Analysis will begin with descriptive analyses of the study sample using means, standard 
deviations, medians, and ranges for continuous variables, and frequency distributions for 
categorical variables. Descriptive statistics and exploratory graphing such as frequencies, 
means, standard deviations, box plots, and scatter plots will be used to assess the 
normality of the data in terms of the presence of skew and/or outliers.  
6.1.1  Analysi s of Primary  & Secondary  Aims  
Data Analysis:   Analysis will begin with descriptive analyses of the study sample using 
means, standard deviations, medians, and ranges for continuous variables, and frequency 
distributions for categorical variables. Descripti ve statistics and exploratory graphing such 
as frequencies, means, standard deviations, box plots, and scatter plots will be used to 
assess the normality of the data in terms of the presence of skew and/or outliers. Primary 
Aims:  The goals of the primary a ims of this study are to determine whether ivacaftor 
treatment improves SEE and BMI Z score. Secondary Aims:  The goal of the secondary aim 
is to determine whether ivacaftor improves gut health and function as measured by total  
plasma fatty acids, fecal el astase and fecal calprotectin  (ug/g stool). Analysis of efficacy for 
the primary and secondary outcomes will be based on change from baseline (before 
treatment) in SEE% predicted (Schofield), BMI Z scores, total plasma fatty acids, fecal 
elastase and fecal  calprotectin. The differences between baseline and 12 weeks continuous 
   
   
18-015299                                                                                                               10/28 /2019   12 
outcomes will initially be compared using paired -t-tests if continuous variables are normally 
distributed and nonparametric tests (Wilcoxon sign rank) if they are not. Subsequently, 
mixed effects longitudinal models will be performed to assess change over all three time 
points (baseline, 6 and 12 weeks), adjusting for potential covariates such as age, sex, and 
adherence to treatment. Chi -squared tests will be used for comparison of cate gorical 
variables before and after ivacaftor treatment. Using similar methods, exploratory analyses 
will examine improvement in dietary intake of calories and fat, in growth status (weight, 
length, and head circumference Z scores) and growth velocity (both  absolute and Z scores), 
serum fat soluble vitamins, bile acids, and calprotectin.   
6.2 Sample Size and Power  
Sample Size and Power:  This is a longitudinal study of the effects of ivacaftor treatment on 
outcomes before and after 12 -week treatment.  The sample  size of 16 subjects to complete 
the study has been determined as adequate to have the power to test the primary 
outcomes of decrease in SEE percent predicted value (7% change), an increase in BMI Z 
score of 0.3, and secondary outcomes of measures of gut h ealth and function; an increase 
in plasma total fatty acids from 8.5 to 10.5 mmol/L, an increase in fecal elastase of 120 ug/g 
stool, and a decrease in fecal calprotectin ( -30 ug/g stool change). Using STATA, power 
calculations were generated, with α=0.05,  for paired data (n=16) within the same sample 
(before and after 12 weeks of treatment) using the changes described above for the primary 
outcomes and secondary outcomes.  
Primary outcomes : A sample size of 16 subjects results in 86% power to see a decreas e of 
7% in SEE (i.e. from 115 to 108) with a standard deviation of the change of 9%, using a 
paired t -test two -sided significance level. We demonstrated a change of similar magnitude 
in REE in 24 subjects with CF gating mutation after 3 -mo treatment with i vacaftor7,9. For 
growth status, 16 subjects will provide 85% power to detect an increase in BMI Z score  of 
0.3 with a standard deviation of 0.4. In the KIWI study of 2 to 5 year old children with CFTR 
gating mutation treated with ivacaftor for 24 weeks, a BMIZ score increase of 0.4±0.4 was 
demonstrated6. We showed a BMI Z score increase over 12 weeks of 0.3±0.4 in our recent 
study of 18 children (5 t o 19 years) with 12 -week ivacaftor treatment7. 
Secondary outcomes:  A sample of 16 subjects will provide 80% power to detect an 
increase in total plasma fatty acids  from 8.5 to 10.5 mmol/L with a standard deviation of 
2.8%, will provide  88% power to detect an increase in fecal elastase  of 120 ug/g stool with 
a standard deviation of 150 ug/g stool, and will provide 85% power to detect a decrease in 
fecal calprotectin  of 30 ug/g stool with a standard deviation of the change of 40 ug/g stool.  
We previously demonstrated a 3 -month increase in plasma total fatty acids of this 
magnitude in subjects with CF receiving a fat -based nutritional supplement19. Davies et al6 
demonstrated a change of 100 ug/g stool in  fecal elastase with 24 -week ivacaftor treatment 
in for 2 to 5 year old children with CFTR gating mutations in the KIWI study, and an even 
greater increase of 164 ug/g stool fecal elastase was shown in 1 to 2 year old children 
participating in the ARRIVAL study16. We have previously demonstrated a 3 -month 
decrease of 30 ug/g s tool in fecal calprotectin with ivacaftor treatment in 5 to 61 year old 
people with CFTR gating mutations7. The standard devi ations of 9% for SEE, 40 ug/g stool 
for fecal calprotectin, 150 ug/g stool for fecal elastase and 0.4 for BMI Z score are 
reasonable estimates of the variability expected in changes for these variables from our 
experience with 3 -12 month changes in these m easures in previous longitudinal clinical 
trials we have conducted for changes in children and adults with CF7,18,19,37,38.  In addition, 
our recent experience with SEE measures in 1 year old healthy children showed a standard 
deviation of 8% in SEE percent predicted values39 (personal communication).  
   
   
18-015299                                                                                                               10/28 /2019   13 
     We plan for up to 12% attrition over the 12 weeks. By enrolling 18 subjects we can 
account for attrition and also allow for the possibility of greater variability in the SEE, BMI Z 
scores and gut health and function measures.  
7 STUDY MEDICATION (ST UDY DEVICE OR OTHER STUDY  INTERVENTION)  
7.1 Description  
This is an observational study of subjects who will be assessed before and after ivacaftor 
use.  The study  will not provide the ivacaftor to the subjects.  It will be clinically prescribed 
by the sub ject’s home CF care provider and the subject will not beg in the ivacaftor 
treatment until after all Baseline (Visit 1) study visit procedures have been completed.  
8 SAFETY MANAGEMENT  
8.1 Clinical Adverse Events  
Clinical adverse events (AEs) will be monitored throughout the study.  
8.2 Adverse Event Reporting  
Since the study procedures are not greater than minimal risk, SAEs are not expected. If any 
unanticipated problems related to the research involving risks to subjects or others happen 
during the course of this study (including SAEs) these w ill be reported to the IRB in 
accordance with CHOP IRB SOP 408: Unanticipated Problems Involving Risks to Subjects. 
AEs that are not serious but that are notable and could involve risks to subjects will be 
summarized in narrative or other format and submit ted to the IRB at the time of continuing 
review.  
9 STUDY ADMINISTRATION  
9.1 Data Collection and Management  
Data Management : The CHPS will work with the study team to create case report forms, 
set up REDcap database, and provide training for data entry and quality assurance. 
REDcap, a secure, web -based database, provides real time calculations, error detection 
and an automated export procedure for seamless data downloads to Excel, SAS and Stata. 
REDcap and all study computers are password protected and allow  for storage of direct 
identifiers and de -identified data in a single database. Subjects will be assigned a unique 
identification number to insure confidentiality. Biological specimens are stored, identified 
using unique numbers in locked CHPS freezer. Rou tine backup to a secure server, 
including images of forms, the main study database, and files created for analysis, and 
analysis programs will be archived daily. Source documents will be stored in locked 
cabinets in secure research facilities with locked d oors and security alarm with 24 hour 
security guard response.  
We will establish a database to store study data using standard software (e.g. RedCap). 
The database will be designed to perform automatic computations, such as exact age 
based upon birth date a nd date of exam, and averaging anthropometric measures, which 
are recorded in triplicate. Reports containing the number of subjects enrolled and data 
entered for each subject are generated and reviewed each month by the PI.  The  PI, or 
study staff, will re view all data collection forms on an ongoing basis for data completeness 
and accuracy as well as protocol compliance. Following data entry, all primary and 
   
   
18-015299                                                                                                               10/28 /2019   14 
secondary endpoint data will be verified against original source documents.  Data 
verification will be performed by someone other than the individual originally collecting and 
entering the data.   
All subjects will be assigned a unique identification number that will be used to insure strict 
confidentiality. The databases are secured with password protect ion to insure 
confidentiality and security. The informatics manager receives only coded information 
which is entered into the database under those identification numbers. Electronic 
communication with outside collaborators involves only unidentifiable info rmation.  A 
master list containing PHI and subject ID number will be kept separate from the data forms 
and the database that will only have a study ID number. The master list will be on a 
separate  password protected  file on CHOP’s secured server . All sourc e documents 
including case report forms, laboratory results, and subject study binders will be kept in 
secured locations  on the 14th floor of the Roberts Center for pediatric Research .  The file 
cabinets and the study -specific room will be locked with acce ss to study personnel only, 
and the outer hallway is also locked with limited access to CHOP research personnel.  
Routine backup to the main study database, files created for analyses, and analysis 
programs will be completed. The main study database will be  archived on a daily basis and 
stored on a CHOP secured server. The Informatics Core of the CHPS  will create case 
report forms, set up the database in RedCap, and provide oversight for data entry and 
quality assurance for this study.  
There is no set time for destroying the information that will be collected for this study .  
9.2 Confidentiality  
Medical history information will be obtained at baseline.  All of the materials collected are 
for research purposes only, and data will be kept in s trict confidence. No information will be 
given to anyone without permission from the subject or parent/guardian of the subject. This 
will be stated in the consent form.  Confidentiality is assured by use of identification codes. 
All data, whether generated  in the laboratory or at the bedside, will be identified with a 
identification code unique to the subject.  
To maintain confidentiality, private health information will be collected, accessed and stored 
in accordance with Institutional policies and HIPAA g uidelines, including the use of 
multilevel password protection and enforcement of system user privileges on the database. 
To minimize the risk of disclosure, all direct identifiers will be removed as soon as possible 
and codes will be substituted for perso nal identifiers. Records of individuals are stored with 
ID numbers and a code with no discernible personal identifiers. Code lists and data files will 
be stored in separate, secure locations. Data will be accessed and stored on password -
protected computers  on the CHOP network . To maintain confidentiality, codes will be used 
in the database, presentations and publications. The Investigator and other site personnel 
will not use such data and records for any purpose other than conducting the study . 
9.3 Regulatory and Ethical Considerations  
9.3.1  Data and Safety Monitoring Plan  
Safety will be formerly monitored weekly by the study team and PI. The IRB and CHPS  will 
also monitor safety. The study protocol will be carried out in accordance with OHRP and 
NIH guidelines and r equirements. SAEs that are unanticipated, serious, and possibly 
related to the study w ill be reported to the IRB, CHPS , all members of the research team, 
the clinical care team, and sponsor in accordance with requirements.   
   
   
18-015299                                                                                                               10/28 /2019   15 
9.3.2  Risk Assessment  
There is minimal  risk to the subject associated with delaying clinically prescribed ivacafto r 
treatment until all procedures for the baseline visit (Visit 1) have been completed.  
The procedures in this study involve the potential risks related to the drawing of blood.  
The risks of drawing blood are rare, and minimal.  There is a small risk of pain, infection 
and local irritation associated with the blood draw . However, this is considered a minimal 
risk and skilled pediatric research nursing staff will  perform phlebotomy . Each subject will 
have approximately 18cc (approximately 1.2 tablespoons ) of blood d rawn at baseline (Visit 
1) and 12 week  (Visit 3) study visit , and 5 cc( 1 teaspoon) at the 6 week visit  (Visit 2) , and 
no more than 5mL/kg over an eight week period.    
The sleeping energy expenditure assessment using the metabolic cart poses minimal risk 
to the subjects. There is minimal risk associated with anthropometric measurements, 
sharing dietary intake, demographic information, health history and medical informati on.   
Collection and storage of stool is associated with a small risk of fecal contamination. 
However, for safety and convenience, subjects will be provided with proper stool collection 
instructions and supplies (gloves, disposable collection containers, s torage freezer 
container).  
Private health information will be collected, accessed and stored according to HIPAA 
guidelines, including the use of multilevel password protection and enforcement of system 
user privileges on the database. To minimize the risk of disclosure, all direct identifiers will 
be removed as soon as possible and codes will be substituted for personal identifiers. 
Records of individuals are stored with ID numbers and a code with no discernible personal 
identifiers. Code lists and data fil es will be stored in separate, secure locations. Data will 
be accessed and stored on password -protected computers. To maintain confidentiality, 
codes will be used in the database, presentations and publications.  
If clinically significant results  are found  as a results of this research study, subjects/families 
will be informed and consent to share findings with their clinical care team will be obtained.  
Once consent to share medical information is obtained, the subject’s clinical care team will 
be contacte d by the study team and the results transferred for appropriate follow -up. 
In the event of a serious adverse event during the study protocol, it will be reported to Dr. 
Stallings (Principal Investigator), the IRB and CHPS, all study team members and sponso r 
as directed by policies and procedures and in accordance with requirements. With the 
approval of families, the information will be provided to their care providers as directed.  
9.3.3  Potential Benefits of Study Participation  
We cannot ensure a direct benefit t o the subjects or their families as a result of 
participating in this study. Participants and their families may benefit from knowing that 
they will contribute to a clinical research study that is important to the health of people with 
CF in the U.S. and a round the world.  
9.3.4  Risk -Benefit Assessment  
The research we propose is justified, considering that the risk associated with participation 
is minimal compared to the potential and anticipated benefits. The benefits of participation 
clearly outweigh the risks, in view of the positive and long -lasting benefits of the study to 
the larger population of people living with CF.  
   
   
18-015299                                                                                                               10/28 /2019   16 
9.4 Recruitment Strategy  
It is expected that all subjects will be recruited by word of mouth and at the 
recommendation of the subjects ’ CF Care Te am. The CF Foundation, CF Centers  and CF 
support organizations around the country and Canada will provide the study with resources 
that will aide in recruitment efforts (i.e. to help to identify young subjects with “gating” 
mutations). Subjects will be rec ruited after introduction by the subject’s CF Care Team. In 
this initial discussion of the study, we plan to have the subject’s CF Care Team use the 
Family Recruitment Flyer, which leaves them with information about the study as well as 
contact information  for the study team. The Family Recruitment Flyer will be used as a tool 
that explains the study in easier terminology, since the flyer sent to other CF Centers has a 
lot more complicated and confusing information that could potentially be overwhelming for  
families. The flyer explains to the family why they and their child are being recruited and 
what the purpose of the study is, and leaves the family with contact information for our 
study team if they want to reach out. Once a family has expressed interest  in participating  a 
CHOP -based research team member will contact the family  via telephone  or in person  and 
continue the introduction of the study to families . Written (in  person) or v erbal (via phone) 
consent will be acquired to collect medical information  to determine eligibility.  For verbal 
screening consent, a waiver of documentation of consent, a waiver of assent and an 
alteration of HIPAA to obtain verbal consent and HIPAA authorization for screening over the 
phone will be in place.  A waiver of verbal  assent is requested due to the fact that the child 
is too young to provide it .In the event that a non -English speaking family is approached for 
screening, an interpreter will be used either by phone  or in person depending upon whether 
the screening takes place  verbally over the phone or in person to present the study in a 
language understandable to the subjects/families. The interpreter can be conferenced into 
the phone call for the consent process.  The screening consent will include the Study 
Summary  Docu ment for interpreter documentation attesting to statements on the summary 
document. This document will be faxed or emailed (using secure email) to the interpreter to 
sign and sent back electronically if the process takes place by phone. All members of the 
team will be available to discuss the details and answer any study related questions as they 
arise. Once interest and eligibility are determined, procedures to set up enrollment will 
begin.  
9.5 Informed Consent/Assent  and HIPAA Authorization  
At entry into the study, parent(s) or legal guardian of the subjects will be asked to review 
the study informed consent form (ICF) .  The Project Coordinator  or other member of the 
clinical research team will meet with the  family on Day 1 of Visit 1  to review the form, to 
confirm the subject understands the study, and to answer any questions that the subject or 
parent/guardian might have.  After all study -related questions are answered and subjects 
and families have had time to consider their decisio n, the Project Coordinator  or member of 
the clinical research team will obtain fully informed, written consent from parent(s) or legal 
guardian of the subjects. Again, in the event of enrollment of a non -English speaking 
subject/family, an interpreter will  be used to present the study and the consent document in 
a language understandable to the family. The main ICF will include a Study Summary 
Document for interpreter documentation attesting to statements on the summary document,  
If the interpreter is not in person but is instead conferenced in by phone, then a copy of this 
attestation document will be faxed or emailed (using secure email) to the interpreter to sign 
and return to the team electronically.  The consent will be signed in the presence of a team 
member. The families will be given a printed copy of the signed, informed consent.   The 
subjects will be too young to assent to this study.  
   
   
18-015299                                                                                                               10/28 /2019   17 
9.5.1  Waiver of Documentation of Consent /Assent and Alteration of HIPAA 
Authorization  
Full waivers of consent will only be  sought for the verbal screening component of the study. 
The rights and welfare of the subject will not be adversely affected because during the 
verbal consent process it is explained to the subject that we are recording their health 
information to determi ne eligibility for the study. Study staff stress during the verbal consent 
that the screening is voluntary, but necessary if they wish to participate, and that they can 
decline and stop the process at any point. A written informed consent will be obtained upon 
study entry before any study procedures are performed.  
9.6 Payment to Subjects/Families  
We will compensate  subjects/families via bank card (ClinCard) at a standard rate  of $150 
per research visit day  to offset incurred expenses, including compensation for time, food, 
and babysitting expenses. The baseline and 12 -week visits will require 2 or 3  days and one 
or two overnight stays to complete the protocol. For the baseline  (Visit 1)  and 12 week (Visit 
3) visits, we have assumed that half the families will receive  $150 to complete the visit and 
study protocol procedures and half will require a n additional day to complete procedures,  
and will receive $300. For the 6 -week visit  (Visit 2) , all families will receive  $150 as an 
additional day will not be an option . The average compensation t o complete the study is 
$600 , with a minimum of $450 and maximum compensation of $750 .  If the subject/family 
total compensation exceeds $600 in one calendar year, they will  be provided with a W9 
form.  
Summary of Range of Payment  
       Each  Visit  If Additional day required  
Visit 1 (Baseline)  $150  $300  
Visit 2 (6 -weeks)  $150  $150*  
Visit 3 (12 weeks)  $150  $300  
            $450 (minimum)              $750 (maximum)  
*The compensation for Visit 2 (6 weeks) will always be $150 as there is no additional day 
option . 
Subjects/Families will be compensated $150 for each visit for your time and effort 
associated with the study protocol procedures . Since  one important test (sleeping energy 
expenditures [SEE] ) for this Baseline Visit 1 require s you to be very still, it is planned to be 
conducted during a nap. If the SEE is not completed in one day than an additional da y may 
be needed.   
If subjects are not loc al to CHOP, they will stay in a nearby hotel for either 1 or 2 nights 
depending upon time of research procedures and whether a Day 3 is needed to complete 
the SEE .  Subjects will also be reimbursed to cover the costs of travel  and parking 
Subjects/  families will provide  official  receipts for these items. The 12 -week Visit 3 plan is 
the same as Visit 1. The 6 -week Visit  2 requires one day of research study procedures.   
For all subjects not from the Philadelphia area, we have assumed that the cost of travel will  
paid for the subject and one family member to accompany the subject for about half of the 
subjects and for two people to accompany the subject for the other half of subjects. The 
overnight stays will also be paid for the family at a hotel nearby  to CHOP.  
   
   
18-015299                                                                                                               10/28 /2019   18 
Travel expenses that are considered reimbursable are: miles to/from CHOP for subjects 
who are traveling regionally (miles to/from the airport or train station, parking at the airport 
or train station  (at a rate of $20/day) , cab to and from the a irport or train station, checked 
bags.  All expenses will be reimbursed with official receipts by bank card ( ClinCard ) 
payment request.   
 
10 PUBLICATION  
The research data obtained through the study outlined in this protocol  will be shared with 
the research community, both through oral presentation at scientific meetings, and in 
written form, as published manuscripts.  Reported factual material (primary data on which 
summary statistics and tables are based), commonly accepted  in the scientific community 
as necessary to document and support research findings, will be provided in a timely 
fashion upon request by members of the scientific community to the principal investigator 
for a period of 3 years following acceptance for pub lication. The CHOP investigators will 
have access to the complete study data.

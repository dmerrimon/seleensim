STUDY 
PROCEDURES:  
 
 
 
 Initially 6 patients will be enrolled in a safety lead -in. If dose 
limiting toxicity is seen during the first 2 cycles in 2 or more 
subjects, the study will be reviewed by the data safety monitoring 
MONOCLONAL ANTIBODY -BASED SEQUENTIAL THERAPY FOR DEEP REMISSION IN MULTIPLE 
MYELOMA

 board that m ay recommend protocol amendment . If less than  2 
subjects develop dose -limiting toxicity during the first 2 cycles of 
therapy accrual will continue at the initial dose level.  
With approval of protocol amendment 2 (PA2) and change on dose 
and schedule of carfilzomib (from 6 to 3 doses per cycle), the n ext 6  
patients starting therapy wi ll be considered to be in a safety lead -in 
at the new dose and schedule and followed the same procedure 
outlined above. Once a new dose and schedule is declared safe, 
previously enrolled patients will switch from 6 doses of carfilzomib 
to 3 doses of carfilzomib per cycle.  
Subjects are expected to transition from induction therapy, to 
consolidation therapy and from consolidation therapy to 
observation/ maintenance therapy according to MRD status. 
Autologous hematopoietic ce ll transplantation (auto -HCT) is the 
initia l step in consolidation therapy. Subjects not eligible for auto -
HCT (per investigator’s assessment) or who choose to defer auto -
HCT will receive four additional cycles of consolidation therapy as 
“replacement” for  auto-HCT. Each cycle of therapy has duration of 
4 weeks, except for auto -HCT that is expected to last 16 weeks 
(including recovery)  
 
INDUCTION  THERAPY  
Screening  – Subjects likely to meet eligibility criteria will be 
offered participation in the study after the investigator verifies UAB 
CTNMO  registration. Subjects will sign informed consent prior to 
any protocol associated procedure. Screening procedures are 
outlined in Table 7 and will ensure that subject 1) meets all the 
eligibility criteria, 2) obtain disease assessment to allow efficacy

MYELOMA   
Confidential   February 12 , 2022 
 Page 8 of 126 measurements, 3) assess baseline toxicity, and 4) provide 
identification  samples for subsequent MRD assessment . 
KRdD Inductio n Therapy - The total duration of induction is 4 
cycles  of 28 -day duration each . In all cycles patients will receive 
dexamethasone 40 mg oral on days 1,8,15 and 22 and lenalidomide 
25 mg ( see adjustment for renal impairment in Table 5 ) daily from 
days 1 -21.  During cycle 1 of induction therapy, subjects will be 
treated on a distinct schedule to avoid overlap of toxicities 
associated with first dose of daratumumab and toxicities associated 
with first dose of carfilzomib. During cycles 1 and 2 subjects will 
receive daratumumab 16 mg/kg on days 1,8,15 and 22.  During 
cycles 3 and 4 subjects will receive daratumumab 16 mg/kg on day 
1 and 15 of each cycle. Carfilzomib will be administered at dose of 
20 mg/m2 on day 8 of first cycle and at dose of 56 mg/m2   on days 
15 of first cycle and days 1 ,8,15 of subsequent induction cycles.   
Response assessment - Response assessment based on serum and 
urine protein electrophoresis , serum and urine immunofixation and 
serum free light chains will occur at the end of cyc les 2 and 4 of 
induction. Bone marrow aspiration with MRD ass essment  (in 
subjects found to be MRD -informative based on clone identification 
sample) will be  performed at the end of cycle 4 (hereafter referred to 
as induction MRD ).  
CON SOLIDATION THERAPY   
Auto-HCT  – Upon completion of induction therapy patients will 
proceed with standard of care auto -HCT  (consolidation 1) . 
Hematopoietic progenitor cell mobilization will be performed 
utilizing growth -factors with or without the addition of plerixafor 
using sta ndard practices. The use of chemotherapy mobilization is 
not allowed as it may add toxicity, delay transplant and post -
MONOCLONAL ANTIBODY -BASED SEQUENTIAL THERAPY FOR DEEP REMISSION IN MULTIPLE 
MYELOMA   
Confidential   February 12 , 2022 
 Page 9 of 126 transplant recovery. Chemotherapy mobilization may be employed 
after failure of initial mobilization attempt and after discussion with 
study PI. Subjects who are transplant eligible  (as determined by 
investigator) , but choose to defer transplant, will collect 
hematopoietic progenitor cells and them proceed to KRdD 
consolidation. Auto -HCT conditioning therapy with consist of 
Melphalan 200mg/ m2 administered as  single dose on day -2 or -1. 
Supportive care following auto -HCT will follow standard of care 
institutional practices. Subjects will resume consolidation therapy 
not earlier than 90 days and ideally not later than 112 days after 
auto-HCT.  
 
KRdD consolidat ion therapy - The total duration of KRD 
consolidation  (consolidat ions 2 and 3)  will be up to 8  cycles ( up to 
12 cycles for patients who don’t undergo auto -HCT)  of 28 -day 
duration each . In all cycles patients will receive dexamethasone 40 
mg oral on days 1,8 ,15 and 22 and lenalidomide 25 mg ( see 
adjustment  for renal impairment in Table 5 ) daily from days 1 -21, 
daratumumab 16 mg/kg on day 1  and 15 on the first two cycles of 
consolidation and on day 1 on remaining cycles  and carfilzomib 56 
mg/m2  on days 1,8 ,15. 
Response assessment - Response assessment based on serum and 
urine protein electrophoresis, serum and urine immunofixation and 
serum free light chains will occur 60-80 days after auto -HCT and at 
the end of each even  cycle during KRdD consolidation. Bone 
marrow aspiration with MRD assay (in subjects found to be MRD -
informative based on clone identification sample) will be performed 
60-80 days after auto -HCT (or on day 1  of cycle 3 of KRdD 
consolidation #1 for patients not undergoing auto -HCT) , hereafter 
MONOCLONAL ANTIBODY -BASED SEQUENTIAL THERAPY FOR DEEP REMISSION IN MULTIPLE

 Page 10 of 126 referred to as consolidation -1 MRD , and, when applicable,  on day  1 
of cycles 3  KRdD  consolidation (cycle 7 for subjects who did not 
undergo auto -HCT ) hereafter referred  to as consolidation -2 MRD  
and on day 1 of cycle 7 of KRdD consolidation (cycle 1 1 for 
subjects who did not undergo auto -HCT) hereafter referred to as 
consolidation -3 MRD  . This approach of assessing MRD at the 
beginning of the third cycle of each 4 -cycle “block” of KRdD 
allows patients who have become confirmed MRD( -) to effectively 
receive two full cycles of consolidation (the third and fourth cycle in 
the block) before hav ing therapy discontinued.  
 
OBSERVATION/ MAINTENANCE THERAPY  
 
Transition to observation/ maintenance therapy  – Subjects will 
start observation/ maintenance therapy after completing the entire 
planned consolidation therapy or after obtaining a confirmed MRD( -
), defined as ≤10-5 MM-associated molecules  in 2 consecutive tests, 
that is induction -MRD plus consolidation -1 MRD or consolidation -1 
MRD plus consolidation -2 MRD or consolidation -2 MRD and 
consolidation -3 MRD . 
MRD negative observation cohort – Subjects who obtain  
confirmed  MRD( -) assessment  in either consolidation -1 MRD or 
consolidation -2 MRD or consolidation -3 MRD will be managed in 
the MRD  (-) observation  cohort . In this cohort, subjects will be 
observed without MM -directed therapy and undergo monitoring, 
including MRD surveillance  during an active surveillance phase (72 
weeks) . Subjects who test positive for MRD at any  of the 
subsequent surveillance MRD assessments while off therapy are 
encouraged to start standard of care maintenance lenalidomide as 
discussed for MRD(+) cohort.  
MONOCLONAL ANTIBODY -BASED SEQUENTIAL THERAPY FOR DEEP REMISSION IN MULTIPLE 
MYELOMA   
Confidential   February 12 , 2022 
 Page 11 of 126 MRD negative cohort d isease assessment - Response assessment 
based on serum and urine protein electrophoresis, serum and urine 
immunofixation and serum free light chains will occur at a 
minimum of every 8 weeks for the first 24 weeks and every 16 
weeks thereafter . Bone marrow aspiration with MRD surveillance 
will be performed 24 and 72 weeks after  start of observation.   
MRD positive  maintenance  cohort – Subjects who are not 
evaluable for MRD status or  don’t have confirmed MRD( -) at the 
end consolidation -3 will not receive more experimental  therapy 
beyond consolidaton -3 and will  be observed  in the MRD(+) cohort. 
In this cohort  subjects will be monitored for overall and 
progression -free survival. It is highly recommended that subjects 
receive standard of care lenalidomide maintenance. Recomme nded 
starting regimen is lenalidomide  10 mg/day continuously until 
progression or intolerance , with dose  modifications and  adjustments 
being performed at treating physician  discretion .  
MRD positive cohort d isease assessment - Response assessment 
based on s erum and urine protein electrophoresis, serum and urine 
immunofixation and serum free light chains  is strongly 
recommended not  less often than every 16  weeks until disease 
progression .

STATISTICAL 
METHODS:  
 Due to limited  data on the safety of the specific combination of 
agents being studied in the induction phase, a safety lead -in was 
performed and include d 6 subjects. No dose limiting toxicity was 
seen during the first 2 cycles in 2 or more subjects (in fact, none of 
the first 6 subjects experienced dose limiting toxicity). The study 
MONOCLONAL ANTIBODY -BASED SEQUENTIAL THERAPY FOR DEEP REMISSION IN MULTIPLE 
MYELOMA   
Confidential   February 12 , 2022 
 Page 13 of 126 was reviewed by the data safety monitoring board that 
recommended accrual will continue at the initial dose level.  
Using Simon’s optimal two -stage design  (optimal design) , a total of 
67 evalu able patients will achieve 80% power to detect  at least 15% 
more M RD negative subjects in the experimental intervention  
compared to the historical benchmark (  60% M RD negative  rate at a 
KRd  + auto -HCT trial) aiming to achieve  at least 75% M RD 
negative upon completion of consolidation in the current protocol .  
Twenty seven patients will be enrolled in the first stage; the trial 
will be terminated if 17 or fewer  patients become MRD negative in  
the first stage. If the trial goes on to the second stage, an additional 
40 evaluable patients (total of 6 7 evaluable patients) will be studied. 
If the total number of subjects to become MRD negative is less than 
or equal to 46, the intervention will be c onsidered futile. By 
accounting for 20% of either subject  drop out or not informative for 
MRD , a total of 82 eligible patients will be require d.  
Upon approval of protocol amendment 4, as long as protocol has not 
met criteria for early stop at first stage and does not meet criteria for 
futility upon completion of second stage, accrual will continue to a 
total of 123 patients, being 77 standard risk (SR) and 44 high risk 
(HR) patients. The expansion will enable the exploratory objective 
to describe  PFS on HR  and SR patients with confirmed MRD ( -) 
status.

1.1 DISEASE SPECIFIC BACKGROUND  
 
Multiple Myeloma (MM) is a malignant plasma cell disorder with no standard curative 
therapy (1) . Symptomatic MM is characterized by a clonal  proliferation of plasma cells 
preceding clinical findings that include bone lesions, fractures, anemia, renal failure and 
hypercalcemia. (2) MM is the second most common hematologic malignancy in the US with 
30,330 expected new cases in 2016 (3).  
For decades, low doses of melphalan and prednisone was the cornerstone of MM 
treatment. However, complete responses under this regime n are rare, and the median time for 
progression is not higher than 15 months (4, 5). A first significant advance in the management of 
MM was the upfront use of high doses of melphalan wi th autologous hematopoietic cell 
transplantation ( auto-HCT ), typically after short induction therapy.  Such treatment has allowed 
for improved response rates, progression free survival and  prolonged survival in MM (6-9) and its 
value has been recently confirmed even in the setting of modern induction therapy (10, 11). High 
dose melphalan with AHSCT  therefore  remains  a fundamental therapeutic modality as part of the 
initial therapy for patients with newly diagnosed MM . 
Induction therapy for patients with newly diagnosed MM (NDMM) has also evolved 
substa ntially. The use of the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib in the setting of 3 -drug regimens 
has produced remission rates in >90% of patients, is well tolerated, and prolongs survival over 
non-bortezomib containing regimens in patients who proceed to auto -HCT  as well as patients 
who remain on conventional therapy (12, 13).   
A major change in paradigm in upfront myeloma therapy has been the transition from 
fixed duration of therapy to continuous therapy, of ten in the format of single agent maintenance 
therapy a fter either conventional induction (14, 15) or induction followed by auto -HCT 
consolidation (14, 16, 17). This approach has impacted the duration of remission and, in a subset 
of studies, also overall survival (15, 16).  
Despite impressive r ates of complete remissions  with induction therapy  and 
implementation of maintenance therapy , the vast majority of MM patients will experience a 
relapse and eventually succumb to the disease, typically after several additional lines of therapy. 
This observ ation highlights the discrepancy between obtaining complete response to therapy by 
MONOCLONAL ANTIBODY -BASED SEQUENTIAL THERAPY FOR DEEP REMISSION IN MULTIPLE 
MYELOMA   
Confidential   February 12 , 2022 
 Page 26 of 126 traditional response criteria and o btaining definitive  disease  eradication as well as the need to 
develop more active treatment regimens and better tools for response assess ment.   
 
1.2 MINIMAL RESIDUAL DISEASE IN MM  
 
More recently, the development and validation of minimal residual disease (MRD) 
assessment by next generation sequencing (NGS) has allowed identification of group of patients 
with very distinct prognosis according to  the burden of disease despite being all in the same 
traditional category of hematologic response (18-20).  
The DFCI/IFM 2009 trial treated patients with a combination of bortezomib, 
lenalidomide and dexamethasone (VRD) as induction , followed by randomization between 
immediate and deferred auto -HCT with subsequent VRD consolidation in both arms and 
lenalidomide maintenance (11). Patients with pre maintenance MRD( -)  had much improved 
progression free survival (>80% at 2 years) than patients MRD(+) , identifying a subset of 
patients who may be cured from the disease and validating a disease assessment tool that may be 
employed for response -adapted therapy (18, 21). MRD assessment by NGS is currently available 
in the US as ClonoSEQ ® test . 
 Other modalities of MRD assessment in MM i nclude flow cytometry and allele -specific 
polymerase chain reaction. These modalities are currently less attractive as a management tool 
due to lower sensitivity , limited cross -validation , limited applicability  and/or higher cost.  
In a recent consensus paper the International Multiple Myeloma Working Group 
(IMWG) defined MRD negative status as < 10-5 cells by flow cytometry or NGS. In this study 
we intend to also report MRD negative rates according to IMWG definition, however for MR D-
adapted therapy we will utilize the more conservative approach of requiring confirmed (2 
consecutive tests) MRD negativity (  ≤ 10-5) to drive abbreviation and discontinuation of therapy.  
Functional imaging as FDG -PET scan can add to bone marrow -based MRD  testing by 
indicating residual foci of myeloma in bone and soft tissue and has been correlated with 
prognosis (22).  
While initial series using higher threshold for MRD detection indicated that MRD and 
cytogenetic abnormalities both contribute to post -remission prognosis (23, 24), more recent series

MYELOMA

 Page 27 of 126 using more sensitive MRD assays indicate that elimination of MRD may trump even the initial 
cytogenetic risk classification (21, 25).  
 
 
1.3 CARFILZOMIB  BACKGROUND  
 
The proteasome is a multicatalytic  proteinase complex that is responsible for degradation 
of a wide variety of protein substrates within normal and transformed cells.  Intracellular proteins 
targeted for degradation by the proteasome are first ubiquitinated via the ubiquitin conjugation 
system.  Ubiquitinated proteins are cleaved within the proteasome by one or more of three 
separate threonine protease activities: a chymotrypsin -like activity, a trypsin -like activity, and a 
caspase -like activity.   
Carfilzomib (PR -171, Kyprolis® ) is a tetrapeptide ketoepoxide -based inhibitor specific 
for the chymotrypsin -like active site of the 20S proteasome.  Carfilzomib is structurally and 
mechanistically distinct from the dipeptide boronic acid proteasome inhibitor bortezomib 
(Velcade®).  In addition, when measured against a broad panel of proteases including metallo, 
aspartyl, and serine proteases, carfilzomib demonstrated less reactivity against non -proteasomal 
proteases when compared to bortezomib (26, 27). 
Carfilzomib was initially approved in the US after demonstrating single agent activity in 
patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma (28, 29), initially at the dose of 27 mg/m2 
on days 1,2,8,9 , 15 and 16 of each 28 -days cycle, with the dose being reduced to 20 mg/m2 on 
the first cycle.  
Subsequently, the dose of carfilzomib has been escalated in an attempt to improve anti -
myeloma activity. In a phase 1 study, the maximal tolerated dose of single agent carfilzomib was 
found to be 56 mg /m2 utilizing the traditional schedule and longer infus ion time (30 
minutes) (30). This regimen led to 55% overall response rate in an independent phase 2 trial of 
heavily pretreated patients (31). The toxicity profile of higher dose of carfilzomib was not clearly 
distinct from the initial dosing with the most common grades 3 or 4 adverse events (AEs) being 
lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia,  hypertension, pneumonia and heart failure.   
MONOCLONAL ANTIBODY -BASED SEQUENTIAL THERAPY FOR DEEP REMISSION IN MULTIPLE 
MYELOMA   
Confidential   February 12 , 2022 
 Page 28 of 126 The Endeavor trial was the first to directly compare two proteasome inhibitors, namely 
bortezomib and carfilzomib , in patients with relapsed MM and 1 -3 prior lines of therapy (32). 
Bortezomib was administered by subcutaneous (79%) or intravenous (21%) routes and 
conventional schedule and doses  in combination with dexamethasone (Vd) . Carfilzomib was 
administered at convent ional schedule but in higher doses, 20 mg/m2 on days 1 and 2 of first 
cycle and 56 mg/m2 thereafter  also in combination with dexamethasone (Kd) . Kd led to higher 
rate of response and median improvement in PFS by 9.3 months. Patients treated with Kd were 
more likely to develop grade 3 or higher heart failure (5% vs. 2%) but less likely to develop 
grade 3 or higher peripheral neuropathy (2% vs. 8%)  than patients treated with Vd . 
Investigators have also explored the use of higher doses of carfilzomib on a less  intense 
schedule, allowing for greater convenience. The Champion 1 study explored weekly carfilzomib 
(i.e. days 1,8,15 of each 28 day cycle) as single agent and found the dose of 70 mg/m2 to be the 
maximum tolerated, leading to objective responses in 77% of patients with relapsed and 
refractory MM (33). More recently, the ARROW study compared weekly carfilzomib at 70 
mg/m2 with the traditional schedule at 27 mg/m2 in patients with relapsed and refractory MM and 
found the weekly dose to have similar safety profile and more prolonged progression -free 
survival (34).  
 
1.3.1 CARFILZOMIB COMBINATION WITH LENALIDOMI DE AND 
DEXAMETHASONE  
 
 
Prior phase 1 and 2 studies demonstrated the safety and efficacy of the combination of 
lenalidomide  (revlimid®) , dexamethasone and carfilzomib in treating patients with rela psed 
myeloma (35). Aspire was a large international phase 3 trial comparing this triple combination 
(KRd) vs. lenalidomide plus dexamethasone (Rd) in patients with relapsed o r refractory MM and 
1-3 prior lines of therapy (36). Carfilzomib was administered on days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15 and 16 of each 
28-days cycle at 20 mg/m2 on days 1 and 2 of first cycle and 27 mg/m2 thereafter, reduced to 
days 1,2,15 and 16 after cycle 12 and discontinued after cycle 18. KRd was superior to Rd in 
progression -free survival (primary endpoint), overall response rate and, importantly, also quality 
of life. Patients randomized to KRd were more likely to develop hypertension (grade 3 or higher 
4.3% vs. 1.8%) and congestive heart failure (grade 3 or higher 3.8 vs 1.8%).

MYELOMA

 Page 29 of 126 The KRd combinations has also been tested  in the treatment of patients with newly 
diagnosed MM producing 61% of stringent CR and 24 -month PFS rate of 92%  in one study (37). 
In another study including a subset of pa tients with smoldering MM, the combination of 
carfilzomib, lenalidomide and dexamethasone led to 100% of VGPR or better. Importantly, 
among the 67% of patients who achieved MRD negative status by NGS, none progressed in the 
first 12 months of therapy  (19). 
 
 
1.4 DARATUMUMAB  BACKGROUND  
 
Daratumumab is a human IgG1 kappa monoclonal antibody directed at CD38, a 
transmembrane protein that is overly expressed on plasma cells and malignant myeloma cells, 
while having low expression on normal lymphoid, myeloid, as well as epithelial tissue. (38) 
Functionally, daratumumab directly targets CD38 -expressing tumor cells and promotes antibody -
dependent cell -mediated cytotoxicity, antibody -dependent cellular phagocytosis, complement -
dependent cytotoxicity and apoptosis. (39) Preclinical data has demonstrated robust  antitumor 
activity in xenograft models, including those with lenalidomide and bortez omib resistant cell 
lines. (39) Daratumumab (Dar zalex®) is approved for treatment of relapsed MM, or newly 
diagnosed  transplant ineligible  MM, in combination w ith bortezomib, melphalan and prednisone . 
 
1.4.1 DARATUMUMAB SINGLE AGENT  
 
The phase 1/2 GEN501 study of daratumumab monotherapy enrolled consecutive cohorts 
receiving daratumumab from 0.005 to 24 mg/kg/dose (40) and identified 16mg/kg as the ideal 
dose with main toxicity being infusion -related events (IREs), mostly pyrexia, cough, dizziness, 
and bronchospasm. Efficacy was reported for the doses of 8mg/kg and 16 mg/kg and patients 
receivin g the 16mg/kg dose had improved ORR (36%) and PFS (5.6 months) compared with the 
8mg/kg.  
The MMY2002 “Sirius” study randomized patients with 3 or more prior lines of therapy 
including a PI and an IMiD or double refractory to PI and IMiD  to be treated with  single agent 
MONOCLONAL ANTIBODY -BASED SEQUENTIAL THERAPY FOR DEEP REMISSION IN MULTIPLE 
MYELOMA   
Confidential   February 12 , 2022 
 Page 30 of 126 daratumumab at either 8mg/kg or 16 mg/kg every week for 8 weeks , then every other week for 
16 weeks and every week afterwards. Overall 106 patients w ere accrued to the 16 mg/kg arm. 
IREs were seen in 42% of patients, mostly during first infusion. In the 16 mg/kg arm the overall 
response rate was 29.2% and median duration of response was 7.4 months (41). 
1.4.2 DARATUMUMAB COMBINATION S 
 
In the phase 1/2 GEN 503 study, patients with relapsed MM received daratumumab in 
combination with l enalidomide and dexamethasone. Among the 32 patients who received 
daratumumab at 16mg/kg , the ORR was 88%, with 53% reaching VGPR or better. Grade 3 or 4 
neutropenia was seen in 75% of subjects, but febrile neutropenia was uncommon. IREs occurred 
in 56% of patients with only 6% being grade 3 (38).  
The synergistic effect of daratumumab and IMiDs was further demonstrated with the 
combination of daratum umab, pomalidomide and dexamethasone in 77 patients with at least 2 
prior lines of therapy including prior treatment with lenalidomide and bortezomib. IREs occurred 
at a rate (61%) similar to daratumumab single agent or in combination with lenalidomide and  
dexamethasone. Neutropenia was the most common grade 3 or higher toxicity (55%). Objective 
responses were seen in 59% of patients, including 58% of the double refractory patients (42).  
Two randomized phase 3 trial have further solidified the benefit of daratumumab 
combinations with IMIDs or with PI. In the CASTOR tr ial patients with relapsed and refractory 
MM were randomized to receive bortezomib and dexamethasone with or without the addition of 
daratumumab. The rate of VGPR or better was higher in the daratumumab arm (59.2% vs. 
29.1%, P<0.001) as was median progress ion-free survival (not reached vs. 7.2 months, HR 0.39, 
P<0.001 (43). Using an IMID backbone, The POLLUX trial randomized  patients with relaps ed 
MM and at least one prior line of therapy to receive lenalidomide plus dexamethasone with or 
without daratumumab. The rate of VGPR or better was higher in the daratumumab arm (75.8% 
vs. 44.2%)  and media progression -free survival was not reached for the daratumumab arm vs.

MYELOMA   
Confidential   February 12 , 2022 
 Page 31 of 126 The KRd  combination can induce high frequency of deep and durable remissions in 
patients with MM, particularly when consolidation is provided with auto -HCT.  In fact a recent 
comparison between KRd conventional treatment and KRd followed by auto -HCT indicates 
further improvement in the depth of remissions with auto -HCT (sCR at 18 months 87% vs. 
55%) (45). There is limited overlapping toxicity between daratumumab and any of the agents in 
KRd. Additionally, there is strong evidence of synergism between daratumumab and IMiDs. We 
therefore hypothesize  that the combination of KRd plus daratumumab (KRdD), particularly in 
combination with auto -HCT, will be safe and lead to deep remission in a large proportion of 
patients with newly diagnosed MM. In fact, a phase 1 study has explored the use of KRdD in 
newly diagnosed MM patients and found the combination to be safe and highly active (46).    
Similar to the paradigm established in other  hematologic malignancies that are 
considered curable, the achievement of MRD( -) status is necessary for long term disease control 
in MM. Patients with sustained MRD( -) status may be able to undergo more abbreviated 
treatment and safely discontinue therapy  without disease recurrence, while patients who remain 
MRD(+) are more likely to benefit from continuous therapy.  
Therefore , this study assesses the safety and efficacy of induction therapy with KRdD, 
followed by auto -HCT and post-transplant  KRdD consolid ation , with duration of therapy 
determined by achievement of MRD( -) status , and treatment discontinuation in  confirmed  MRD 
(-) patients. Since continuous therapy is considered the current standard of care for patients with 
newly diagnosed MM, the study wil l assess the feasibility of monitoring for MRD resurgence 
(≥10-5) on confirmed  MRD(-) patients off therapy providing the opportunity for those subjects to 
proceed with SOC maintenance lenalidomide if resurgence of MRD.

 Page 33 of 126 3 EXPERIMENTAL PLAN  
3.1 STUD Y DESIGN  
This is a Single arm, multi -center, open label phase 2 trial with safety lead in and 
response -adapted therapy   
3.1.1 INDUCTION THERAPY  
The maximal tolerated dose of weekly carfilzomib when administered in combination 
with dexamethasone, lenalidomide and daratumumab has not been determined. The dose of 
56mg/m2 was chosen as a one level dose reduction from the dose of carfilzomib utilized as single 
agent in the ARROW trial, therefore accounting for the possib ility of added toxicity when 
carfilzomib is used in combination (34).  
Therefore, upon approval of PA2  6 subjects were  enrolled in a safety lead in cohort that 
received  induction therapy with the following regimen, with a target dose of carfilzomib of 56 
mg/m2: 
Cycle 1  
 Dexamethasone 40 mg PO days 1,8,15 and 22  
 Lenalidomide 25 mg PO daily, days 1 -21 
 Carfilzomib 20 mg/m2 day 8 ; Carfilzomib 56 mg/m2 day  15 
 Daratumumab 16 mg/kg days 1, 8, 15 and 22  
Cycle 2  
 Dexamethasone 40 mg PO days 1,8,15 and 22  
 Lenalidomide 25 mg PO daily, days 1 -21 
 Carfilzomib 56 mg/m2 days 1, 8 , and 15 
 Daratumumab 16 mg/kg day s 1, 8, 15 and 22  
Cycles 3 -4 
Dexamethasone 40 mg (or LTD) PO days 1,8,15 and 22

 Page 34 of 126  Lenalidomide 25 mg (or LTD) PO daily, days 1 -21  
 Carfilzomib 56 mg/m2  (or LTD)  days 1,  8, and 15  
 Daratumumab 16 mg/kg days 1,15  
 
-If < 2  subjects experience  a DLT during the first two cycles in the safety lead -in cohort, 
the regimen would  be considered safe and enrollment would  proceed with individuals being 
treated at the same dose level.  
-If  2 or more subjects experience d a DLT during the first two cycles in the safety lead -in 
cohort, the study would be reviewed by the data safety monitoring board that may recommend 
protocol amendment.   
No DLT was verified during the first 2 cycles of the initial 6 subjects enrolled under PA2. 
Therefore the data safety monitoring board considered the combination regimen safe and 
authorized subsequent enrollment.  
Response assessment based on serum and urine protein electrophoresis, serum and urine 
immunofixation and serum free light chains will occur at the end of cycles 2 and 4 of induction. 
Bone marrow aspiration with MRD assay (in subjects found to be MRD -informative based on 
clone identification sample) will be performed at the end of cycle 4 (hereafter referred to as 
induction MRD ).  
 
3.1.1.1  Definition of DLT  
For the safety lead -in cohort , the occurrence of any of the below toxicities during the first  
2 cycles of therapy will be considered dose -limiting toxicities  when definitively, probably or 
possibly attributed to study drug : 
1) Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count < 1 000/mm3) with fever . 
2) Grade 4 neutropenia lasting more than 7 days.  
3) Grade 4 thrombocytopenia (< 25,000/mm3) with bleeding or lasting more than 7 days.

5) Grade 3 toxicity other than hematological toxicity,  fever, chills, dyspnea, rash, fatigue, 
flu-like syndrome, pain, anorexia, glucose intolerance , alkaline phosphatase elevation or  
hypertension . 
6) Death from any cause.  
3.1.2 CONSOLIDATION  
Upon completion of 4 cycles of induction therapy , patients  will proceed with standard of 
care auto -HCT , hereafter called consolidation 1 . Hematopoietic progenitor cell mobilization will 
be performed utilizing growth -factors (G -CSF, Pegfilgrastim or similar) with or without the 
addition of plerixafor using standar d practices at the enrolling site.  
 
The use of chemotherapy mobilization is not allowed as it may add toxicity, delay 
transplant and post -transplant recovery. Chemotherapy mobilization may be employed after 
failure of initial mobilization attempt and afte r discussion with study PI.  
 
Subjects who are transplant eligible, but choose to defer transplant, will collect 
hematopoietic progenitor cells and them proceed to KRdD consolidation  (also labeled 
consolidation block 1). Subjects that are considered by the  investigator not to be transplant 
eligible will proceed to KRdD consolidation block 1 without hematopoietic progenitor cells 
collection.  
 
Auto -HCT conditioning therapy with consist of Melphalan 200mg/m2 administered as 
single or divided dose on day -2 and/or -1. Supportive care following auto -HCT will follow 
standard of care institutional practices. Subjects will resume consolidation therapy not earlier 
than 90 days and ideally not later than 112 days after auto -HCT.  
 
Subjects undergoing KRdD as consolid ation  block  1 will receive  4 28-day cycles 
consisting of : 
Dexamethasone 40 mg (or LTD) PO days 1,8,15 and 22

Subjects not achieving confirmed  MRD( -) status during consolidation block 1 (i.e. <10-5 
on induction -MRD and consolidation -1 MRD ) will undergo consolidation  block  2 and, if still not 
confirmed  MRD( -)(i.e. <10-5 on consolidation -1 MRD and consolidation -2 MRD) they will 
undergo consolidation  block  3. Consolidations block 2 and block 3 consist each of a block of 4  
28-day cycles of KRdD as outlined:  
Dexamethasone 40 mg (or LTD) PO days 1,8,15 and 22  
 Lenalidomide 25 mg (or LTD) PO daily, days 1 -21  
 Carfilzomib 56 mg/m2 (or LTD) days 1,  8, and 15  
Daratumumab 16 mg/kg days 1 (days 1 and 15 in the first two cycles of consolidation 
block 2 for patients who underwent auto -HCT as consolidation block 1)  
 
Response assessment based on serum and urine protein electrophoresis, serum and urine 
immunofixation and serum free light chains will occur 60-80 days after auto -HCT and at the end 
of each even cyc le during KRdD consolidation  (for consolidations 1,2 and 3) . Bone marrow 
aspiration with MRD assay (in subjects found to be MRD -informative based on clone 
identification sample) will be performed 60-80 days after auto -HCT (or on day  1 of cycle 3 of 
KRdD co nsolidation  block  1 for patients not undergoing auto -HCT), hereafter referred to as 
consolidation -1 MRD , and, when applicable, on day 1 of cycles 3  KRdD  of consolidation  
block  2 hereafter referred to as consolidation -2 MRD and on day 1 of cycle 3 of KRdD

consolidation therapy or after obtaining confirmed MRD( -)(≤10-5 MM-associated in two 
consecutive tests ) assessment on consolidation -1 MRD , consolidation -2 MRD  or consolidation -3 
MRD .  
 
3.1.3.1  MRD negative cohort  
 
Subjects who obtain confirmed MRD( -) assessments  in consolidation -1 MRD , 
consolidation -2 MRD  or consolidation -3 MRD   will be observed  in the  confirmed  MRD( -
)cohort.  
Subjects will enter an active surveillance phase when they will  undergo response 
assessment based on serum and urine protein electrophores is, serum and urine immunofixation 
and serum free light chains not less often than every 8 weeks for the first 24 weeks after 
discontinuation of therapy and not less often than every 16 weeks afterwards.  Subjects will 
undergo active surveillance for resurg ence of MRD (≥10-5) by undergoing bone marrow aspirate

3.2 NUMBER OF CENTERS  
 
UAB  (P.I. Dr. Luciano Costa) will be the coordinating center for the study  with 
participation of up to 6 additional sites . 
3.3 NUMBER OF SUBJECTS  
 
Six subjects were  enrolled in the safety lead -in cohort. Additional subjects (estimated 
between 2 7 and 32), necessary for 2 7 MRD evaluable subjects will be enrolled in the first stage 
of the study. If more than 17 MRD evaluable subject reach MRD( -) status at completion of 
consolidation, additional subjects will be enrolled in the second stage for a total of 82 (and 
estimated 68 MRD evaluable) subjects in the study.  As long as this experimental therapy is not  
declared futile at end of second stage, the study will  be expanded  to enroll additional 41 subjects 
(total 123) to enable description  of PFS in HR and SR patients reaching confirmed MRD (-) and 
undergoing treatment discontinuation.

3.6 MINIMAL RESIDUAL DISEASE ASSESSMENT S 
 
MRD assessment by ClonoSEQ ® requires an initial marrow sample  containing  myeloma 
cells for identification of myeloma -specific sequences in IGH -VDJ, IDH -DJ and/or IGK. During 
screening a fresh bone marrow sample or archive, non -stained bone marrow aspirate slide  (“ID 
sample”)  will be sent to Adaptive biotechnologies  to be assessed for the presence of myeloma -
speci fic sequences.  
For all samples with MRD assessment, MRD will be reported quantitatively as 
proportion of multiple myeloma -associated sequences. For treatment assignment and clinical 
trial outcome reporting, we will consi der MRD( -) if the burden of MM -assoc iated molecules  is < 
10-5. 
Subjects who achieve  confirmed  MRD( -) status with < 10-5 MM associated molecules 
during consolidation will undergo FDG PET/CT scan prior to starting the active surveillance 
phase in the  MRD( -) cohort. FDG PET/CT will be interpre ted by the enrolling site  and report

no area of FDG uptake greater than mediastinal blood pool or surrounding normal tissue . 
3.6.1 TIME POINTS OF SAMPLE COLLECTION  
 
Subjects with informative sequences found on initial “ID sample” will be considered 
“MRD informative” and will undergo MRD assessment at the following time points : 
-At the end of 4th cycle of induction (Induction MRD)  
-After recovery of auto -HCT or on the  3rd cycle of KRdD consolidation ( consolidation -1 
MRD)   
-When applicable, on day 1 of cycles 3 of KRdD of consolidation  block 2 (consolidation -
2 MRD)  and consolidation  block  3 (consolidation -3 MRD)  
-For subjects underg oing observation  in the MRD( -) cohort, after 24 and 72 weeks in the 
observation  phase.  
  
3.6.2 SAMPLE COLLECTION AND SHIPMENT  
  
At each of these time points a sample for MRD will obtained through bone marrow 
aspirate.  Samples will be sent to Adaptive biotechnology for Clono SEQ ® testing. Samples will 
not be retained for future analysis.

6.1 DRUG PREPARATION AND ADMINISTRATION   
6.1.1 CARFILZOMIB  
 
• Carfilzomib for Injection is supplied as a lyophilized parenteral product in single -use vials. 
The lyophilized product is reconstituted with Water for Injection to a final carfilzomib 
concentration of 2 mg/mL prior to administration.  The dose will be calculated using the 
subject’s actual BSA at ba seline.  Subjects with a BSA > 2.2 m2 will receive a dose based 
upon a 2.2 m2 BSA.   
• At the discretion  of the investigator, patients thought to be at particularly high risk for the 
development of TLS, based on high tumor burden , oral  hydration  will be enco uraged , at least 
48 hours before each dose of carfilzomib  (6 to 8 cups of liquid per day) continuing up to the 
time of treatment.   
• IV hydration will  be given immediately prior to carfilzomib.  This will consist of 250 to 500 
mL normal saline or other appr opriate IV fluid. The goal of the hydration program is to 
maintain robust urine output (eg, ≥ 2 L/day).  Subjects should be monitored periodically 
during this period for evidence of fluid overload . On the days the subject receives both 
daratumumab and carf ilzomib, the infusion of daratumumab will replace the hydration to be 
given prior to carfilzomib . 
• If the subject has a dedicated line for carfilzomib administration, the line must be flushed 
with a minimum of 20  mL of normal saline prior to and after drug administration.     
• Carfilzomib will be given as an IV infusion over approximately 30 minutes  (±10 minutes) . 
The dose will be administered at a facility capable of managin g hypersensitivity reactions.   
• Carfilzomib will be provided by Amgen .

6.3 SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS  
 
• A “first dose effect” has been seen with carfilzomib, which is notable for fever, chills, rigors, 
and/or dyspnea occurring during the evening following the first day of infusion and an 
increase in cr eatinine on the following day, which may be the clinical sequelae of rapid 
tumor lysis and/or cytokine release.    
MONOCLONAL ANTIBODY -BASED SEQUENTIAL THERAPY FOR DEEP REMISSION IN MULTIPLE 
MYELOMA   
Confidential   February 12 , 2022 
 Page 63 of 126 • Carfilzomib will be generally administered on the same day of daratumumab administration. 
Carfilzomib should be administered after completion  of daratumumab administration. 
Therefore, subjects will have received 20 mg of dexamethasone as premedication prior to 
daratumumab. In the event of patient receiving carfilzomib but not daratumumab in a given 
day, d examethasone at least 4 mg IV will be ad ministered prior to carfilzomib.  
• Should a “first dose  carfilzomib  effect” occur,  treatment with high dose glucocorticoids (e.g. 
methylprednisolone 50 –100 mg) is recommended.  In addition, intravenous fluids, 
vasopressors, oxygen, bronchodilators, and acet aminophen should be available for immediate 
use and instituted, as medically indicated.  
• CrCl changes induced by carfilzomib are mostly transient, reversible, and non -cumulative. 
All subjects should be well hydrated.  Clinically significant electrolyte abn ormalities should 
be corrected prior to dosing with carfilzomib. Renal function must be monitored closely 
during treatment with carfilzomib.  Serum chemistry values, including creatinine, must be 
obtained and reviewed prior to each dose of carfilzomib. Car filzomib must be held for 
subjects with a CrCl < 15 mL/min at any time during study participation.  
• Carfilzomib is associated with increased risk of cardiac events that are, at least in part, linked 
to increase in blood pressure. Intense blood pressure monitoring is required for patients being 
treated with carfilzomib. All subjects will receive a blood pressure monitoring log where 
daily blood pressure measurements will be recorded. The log will be reviewed at each 
clinical visit and hypertensio n will be actively managed by the investigator  
• Subjects with active or suspected infection of any kind that required systemic treatment 
should not be dosed with carfilzomib , lenalidomide or daratumumab  until the infection has 
resolved (and preferentially the course of antibiotics has been completed ).  
• Carfilzomib treatment can cause nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or constipation sometimes 
requiring the use of antiemetic or antidiarrheal medications.  Fluid and electrolyte 
replacement should be administered to prevent dehydration.  
• Lenalidomide, a thalidomide analogue, can cause limb abnormalities. If lenalidomide is used 
during pregnancy, it may cause birth defects or embryo -fetal death. Pregnancy must be 
excluded before start of treatment.  
MONOCLONAL ANTIBODY -BASED SEQUENTIAL THERAPY FOR DEEP REMISSION IN MULTIPLE 
MYELOMA   
Confidential   February 12 , 2022 
 Page 64 of 126 • Lenalidomide is assoc iated with increase in risk of venous and arterial thromboembolism. 
Anti-thrombotic prophylaxis with aspirin or anticoagulation is required.  
• Lenalidomide can impair stem cell mobilization. Stem cell collection is recommended after 
no more than 4 cycles of therapy containing lenalidomide for subjects who are consider 
adequate candidates for hematopoietic progenitor cell transplantation.  
• Daratumumab is associated with risk of infusion -related reactions  (mostly fever, cough, 
dizziness, bronchospasm)  in approxi mately 40% of patients. These reactions are mostly 
grades 1 and 2 and occur during first infusion. See guidelines for management of 
daratumumab infusion -related reactions in  6.3.2 . 
• The treatment with melphalan as outlined in this protocol constitutes stand ard of care. The 
dose of 200mg/m2 of melphalan is myeloablative, therefore subjects are expected to develop

neutropenic fever and anemia requiring transfusion of red  blood cells.  
• Melphalan at the doses employed in this protocol will cause nausea, vomiting and mucositis

6.3.1 GUIDELINES FOR MONITORING, PROPHYLAXIS, AND TREATMENT OF 
TUMOR LYSIS SYNDROME (TLS)  
 
TLS, which may be associated with multiorgan failure, has been observed in some 
patients with MM who have been treated with carfilzomib , lenalidomide and dexamethasone, 
alone or in combination, during first or second cycles of therapy .  
 
The following safety measures are mandatory for all subjects.  In  addition, MM subjects 
with high tumor burden (e.g., Durie -Salmon or ISS  Stage II/III) or rapidly increasing M -protein 
or light chains or compromised renal function (CrCl < 50 mL/min) should be considered  to be at 
particularly high risk. Please see section  6.1.1  for hydration requirements.  
6.3.1.1  Laboratory Monitoring  
 
MONOCLONAL ANTIBODY -BASED SEQUENTIAL THERAPY FOR DEEP REMISSION IN MULTIPLE 
MYELOMA   
Confidential   February 12 , 2022 
 Page 65 of 126 Appropriate c hemistries, including creatinine and complete blood counts (CBC) with 
platelet count, should be obtained and reviewed prior to carfilzomib dosing.  Results of 
laboratory studies must be reviewed and deemed acceptable prior to administering the 
carfilzomib dose.  Subjects with laboratory abnormalities consistent with lysis of tumor cells 
(e.g., serum creatinine ≥ 50% increase, LDH ≥ 2 -fold increase, uric acid ≥ 50% increase, 
phosphate ≥ 50% increase, potassium ≥ 30% increase, calcium ≥ 20% decrease) prior to  dosing 
should not receive the scheduled dose.  Subjects with such abnormalities should be re -evaluated 
again within the next 24 hours (or sooner, if clinically indicated) and then periodically as 
clinically indicated.    
6.3.1.2   Management of Tumor Lysis Syndrom e 
 
If TLS occurs, cardiac rhythm, fluid, and serial laboratory monitoring should be 
instituted.  Correct electrolyte abnormalities, monitor renal function and fluid balance, and 
administer therapeutic and supportive care, including dialysis, as clinically indicated.  
All cases of TLS must be reported to Amgen  as a Serious Adverse Event (SAE) through 
the normal process within 24  hours of the clinical site becoming aware of the event.  
 
 
6.3.2 GUIDELINES FOR MONITORING, PROPHYLAXIS, AND TREATMENT OF 
DARATUMUMAB INFUSION -RELATED REACTION (IRR)  
 
Daratumumab infusion -related reactions occur in approximately 40% of patients 
receiving first dose of daratumumab. Most reactions are grade 1 or 2, but se rious, including life -
threatening reactions have occurred.  
Common manifestations of IRR are pyrexia, cough, bronchospasm, dizziness,  urticaria  
reduction in blood pressure.  
6.3.2.1  Prevention  
All patients receiving daratumumab will receive preinfusion medication consisting  of: 
• Dexamethasone 20 mg IV;  
MONOCLONAL ANTIBODY -BASED SEQUENTIAL THERAPY FOR DEEP REMISSION IN MULTIPLE 
MYELOMA   
Confidential   February 12 , 2022 
 Page 66 of 126 • Acetaminophen  650 to 1000 mg PO  
• Antihistamine given IV or PO (diphenhydramine 25 to 50 mg or equivalent).  
• Montelukast 10 mg PO the day before and day of infusion.  
For subjects with a higher risk of respiratory complications, the following postinfusion 
medications should be considered:  
• Antihistamine given IV or PO (diphenhydramine 25 to 50 mg or equivalent) on 
the first and second day after all the i nfusions  
• Short -acting beta 2 adrenergic receptor agonists such as salbutamol aerosol.  
 
 
6.3.2.2  Management of infusion -related reactions  
 
Subjects should be carefully observed during daratumumab infusions. Trained study staff 
at the  clinic should be prepared to intervene in case of any infusion reactions, and resources 
necessary  for resuscitation (eg, agents such as epinephrine and aerosolized bronchodilator, also 
medical  equipment such as oxygen tanks, tracheostomy equipment, and a defibrillator) mus t be 
available  at bedside. Attention to staffing should be considered when multiple subjects will be 
dosed at the  same time.  If an infusion -related reaction develops, then the infusion should be 
temporarily interrupted or  slowed down. Subjects who experien ce adverse events during the 
infusion must be treated  according to the investigator’s judgment and best clinical practice. The 
following guidelines  apply:  
• Subjects should be treated with acetaminophen, antihistamine, or corticosteroids 
as needed.  Intraveno us saline may be indicated. For bronchospasm, urticaria , or 
dyspnea, subjects may  require antihistamines, oxygen, corticosteroids, or 
bronchodilators. For hypotension,  subjects may require vasopressors.  
• In the event of a life -threatening infusion -related r eaction (which may include 
pulmonary or  cardiac events) or anaphylactic reaction, daratumumab should be 
MONOCLONAL ANTIBODY -BASED SEQUENTIAL THERAPY FOR DEEP REMISSION IN MULTIPLE 
MYELOMA   
Confidential   February 12 , 2022 
 Page 67 of 126 discontinued and no  additional daratumumab should be administered to the 
subject. Aggressive symptomatic  treatment should be applied.  
• If an infusion is paused or the infusion rate is decreased, then a longer -than-
anticipated  infusion time may occur. Overnight stays at the hospital because of 
slow infusion times  should not be reported as serious adverse events.  
• For IRR grades 1 and 2 the then t he infusion should  be paused. When the 
subject’s condition is stable, the infusion may be restarted at the  investigator’s 
discretion. Upon restart, the infusion rate should be half of that employed before  
the interruption. Subsequently, the infusion rate m ay be increased at the 
investigator’s discretion.  If the subject experiences a Grade 2 or higher event of 
laryngeal edema, or a Grade 2 or higher  event of bronchospasm that does not 
respond to systemic therapy and does not resolve within  6 hours from onset , then 
the subject must be withdrawn from treatment.   
• For IRR grade 3 or higher the infusion must be stopped and  the subject must be 
observed carefully until resolution of the adverse event. If the intensity of  the 
adverse event decreases to Grade 1 or 2 w ithin 2 hours, then the infusion may be 
restarted at  the investigator’s discretion. Upon restart, the infusion rate should be 
half of that employed  before the interruption. Subsequently, the infusion rate may 
be increased at the investigator’s  discretion .  
 
 
6.4 CONCOMITANT MEDICATIONS  
 
Concomitant medication is defined as any prescription or over -the-counter preparation 
including vitamins and supplements.  Concomitant medications should be recorded from 14 days 
before Day -3 through the end of the subject’s st udy participation.  Any change in concomitant 
medications must be recorded.

special situations including pregnancies and product quality complaints  for J&J Medicinal 
Product and for Amgen Medicinal Product  regardless of causality and special situations 
excluding those from subjects not exposed to a J&J medicinal product and/or Amgen medicinal 
product,  quality complaints with or without an adverse event as described in this protocol will be 
reported from the time a subject has signed and dated an Informed Consent Form (ICF) until  30 
days after th e last documented use of product under study within the study. All subsequent AEs 
and SAEs will be collected after this period if the Principal Investigator considers the AE/SAE to 
be causally -related to the study drug.

9.3 ADVERSE EVENTS DEFINITIONS  
 An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study subject 
administered a medicinal (investigational or non -investigational) product. An adverse event does 
not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment. An adverse event can therefore be 
any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abno rmal finding), symptom, or disease 
temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational or non - investigational) 
product, whether or not related to that medicinal (investigational or non -investigational) product. 
(Definition per International  Conference on Harmonisation [ICH])  
This includes any occurrence that is new in onset or aggravated in severity or frequency 
from the baseline condition, or abnormal results of diagnostic procedures, including laboratory 
test abnormalities.  
An unexpected AE is any adverse drug event, the specificity or severity of which is not 
consistent with the current IB or prescribing information for a marketed compound.   Also, 
reports which add significant information on specificity or severity of a known, already 
documented AE constitute unexpected AEs.   For example, an event more specific or more severe 
than described in the IB would be considered “unexpected”.    
Whenever possible, the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) 
version 4.0 should be used  to describe the event and for assessing the severity of AEs (see 
Appendix  A).  Any events representing a change in the CTCAE Grade need to be reported on the 
AE case report form.  This includes any change in laboratory values.   
For AEs not adequately add ressed in the CTCAE, the severity Table  10 below may be 
used:

Table 10 - Adverse Event Severity  
Severity  Description  
GRADE 1 – Mild  Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or 
diagnostic observations only; intervention not 
indicated.  
GRADE 2 – Moderate  Moderate; minimal local or noninvasive 
intervention indicated; limiting age -appropriate 
instrumental activities of daily living (ADL).  
GRADE 3 – Severe  Severe or medically significant but not life -
threatening; hospitalization or prolongation of 
hospitalization indicated; disabling; limited self -care 
ADL.  
GRADE 4 – Life-threatening   Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention 
indicated.  
GRADE 5 – Fatal  Death related to AE.  
 
Any condition, laboratory abnormality, or physical finding with an onset date prior to the 
subject signing consent for study participation is considered to be pre -existing in nature and part 
of the subject’s medical history.  
9.4 CAUSALITY  
Using the following c riteria, the relationship of the AE to the study drug should be assessed as 
follows:   
Yes:  The event is suspected to be related if:  
• there is a clinically plausible time sequence between onset of the AE and administration 
of study treatment; and/or  
• there  is a biologically plausible mechanism for the study treatment to cause or contribute 
to the AE; and/or  
• the event responds to withdrawal of the study medication (dechallenge) and/or recurs 
with rechallenge (when clinically feasible); and/or  
• the AE cannot be reasonably attributed to concurrent/underlying illness, other drugs, or 
procedures  
No:  
• the AE is more likely to be explained by the subject’s clinical state, underlying disease, 
concomitant medication, study or non -study procedure; and/or  
MONOCLONAL ANTIBODY -BASED SEQUENTIAL THERAPY FOR DEEP REMISSION IN MULTIPLE 
MYELOMA   
Confidential   February 12 , 2022 
 Page 79 of 126 • the time of occurrence of the AE is not reasonably related to administration of study 
treatment; and/or  
• the event is unlikely to be related to the investigational product(s)  
9.5 ADVERSE EVENTS OF SPECIAL INTEREST  (DARATUMUMAB)  
 
All Adverse events of special interest are events that Janssen Scientific Affairs, LLC  
(J&J)  is actively monitoring as a result of a previously identified signal (even if non -serious). 
These adverse events are:  
• Infusion reactions : ≥ grade 3  
• Infections : ≥ grade 4  
• Cytopenias : ≥ grade 4  
• HBV reactivation  
• Other malignancies  
 
Any Adverse Event of Speci al Interest that is to be reported to the COMPANY should be 
recorded on a Serious Adverse Event Report From and be reported to the COMPANY within 24 
hours of knowledge of the event.  
9.6 UNLISTED (UNEXPECTED ADVERSE EVENTS/REFERENCE SAFETY 
INFORMATION  
 
An adve rse event is considered unlisted if the nature or severity is not consistent with the 
applicable product reference safety information. For a medicinal product(s) with a marketing 
authorization, the expectedness of an adverse event will be determined by whe ther or not it is

MYELOMA   
Confidential   February 12 , 2022 
 Page 80 of 126  
 
All AEs (e.g., any new event or worsening in severity or frequency of a pre -existing 
condition or laboratory finding) with an onset date after the subject signs consent for study 
participation must be promptly documented on the appropriate summary.  Details of the event 
must include severity, relationship to stu dy drug, duration, action taken, and outcome.  Serious 
adverse events (SAEs) will be recorded on the appropriate form.  
 
All AEs that are considered related to study drug must be followed to resolution or 
stabilization if improvement is not expected.  
 
AEs should be reported from the time the subject signs consent through 30 days post -last 
dose of study drug or initiation of a new anti -cancer therapy, whichever occurs first.  In addition, 
the Investigator should report any AE that may occur after this time p eriod that is believed to 
have a reasonable possibility of being associated with study drug.  If a subject is registered but 
discontinues the study prior to receiving any study drug, AEs must be reported through the end -
of-study visit.  AEs which  completel y resolve and then recur should be recorded as a new AE.  
For subjects who complete the end of study visit less than 30  days following their last dose of 
study drug, a follow up of ongoing AEs should be attempted by telephone and documented in the 
subject’ s source document.  AEs continuing at 30 days post -last dose should have a comment in 
the source document by the Investigator that the event has stabilized or is not expected to 
improve.  
 
The experimental approach encompassed in this protocol governs induc tion therapy and 
post auto -HCT consolidation and maintenance therapy. Auto -HCT itself is standard of care 
treatment with well known toxicity profile. Therefore AEs that occur after initiation of auto -HCT 
and before initiation of post auto -HCT consolidation  are not reportable unless they occur within 
30 days of last dose of carfilzomib, daratumumab or lenalidomide.

 Page 81 of 126 The Principal Investigator is responsible for evaluating all AEs, obtaining supporting 
documents, and determining that documentation of the even t is adequate.  Adverse events will be 
assigned a severity grade using the NCI -CTCAE grading scale v4.0.   
 
All Grade 3 and 4  adverse events  must be recorded as AEs on the CRF.  Grade 1 and 2 
adverse events should only be recorded if considered clinically significant by the Investigator.  
 
The Principal Investigator may delegate these duties to Sub -investigators and must ensure 
that these Sub -investigators are qualified to perform these duties under the supervision of the 
Principal Investigator and that they  are listed on the FDA Form 1572.

 Page 82 of 126 9.8 SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS DEFINITIONS  
 
A serious adverse event (SAE) based on ICH and EU Guidelines on Pharmacovigilance 
for Medicinal Products for Human Use is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
• Results in  death  
• Is life -threatening  
(The subject was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event that 
hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe.)  
• Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• Is a suspected transmission of any infectious agent via a medicinal product  
• Is medically important*  
 
*Medical and scientific ju dgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited 
reporting is also appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be 
immediately life threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the subject 
or may require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above. 
These should usually be considered serious.  
Any death for any reason occurring within 30 days of the subject receiving study drug, 
regardless of the subject hav ing discontinued from the study must be reported to the 
Janssen Scientific Affairs and Amgen Global Safety  as an SAE.

 Page 83 of 126  
 
9.8.1 HOSPITALIZATION   
 
 For reports of hospitalization, it is the sign, symptom or diagnosis which led to the 
hospitalization that is the serious event for which details must be provided.  
Any event requiring hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization that occurs 
during t he study must be reported as a serious adverse event, except hospitalizations for the 
following:  
• Hospitalizations not intended to treat an acute illness or adverse event 
(e.g., social reasons such as pending placement in long -term care facility)  
• Surgery or procedure planned before entry into the study. [Note: 
Hospitalizations that were planned before the start of data collection and where the 
underlying condition for which the hospitalization was planned has not worsened will not 
be considered ser ious adverse events. Any adverse event that results in a prolongation of 
the originally planned hospitalization is to be reported as a new serious adverse event.]  
• [For convenience the investigator may choose to hospitalize the subject for 
the duration of t he treatment period.]  
 
9.8.2 LIFE -THREATENING CONDITIONS   
 
 Disease progression should not be recorded as an adverse event or serious adverse event 
term; instead, signs and symptoms of clinical sequelae resulting from disease progression/lack of 
efficacy will b e reported if they fulfill the serious adverse event definition.

(DARATUMUMAB)  
 
All SAEs occurring from the time that the subject signs consent for study participation 
through 30 days after the last  administered dose of study drug will be reported.  All SAEs, 
regardless of relationship to study drug, must be followed to resolution or to stabilization if 
improvement or resolution is not expected.  
If a subject is permanently withdrawn from the study be cause of a SAE, this information 
must be included in the initial or follow -up SAE report as well as the appropriate form for Study 
Discontinuation.  
The PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR  is responsible for notifying the appropriate 
Regulatory Agencies, when required, and in accordance with applicable laws and regulations of 
any Expedited Safety Reports.  Generally, these are all SAEs that are judged to be unexpected 
and related to study drug(s), as specified in ICH E2B guidelines: Clinical Safety Data 
Management Data E lements for Transmission of Individual Case Safety Reports .   However, 
certain Regulatory Agencies may have additional requirements for expedited safety report 
submissions . 
This submission of IND Safety Reports (North America) or Suspected Unexpected 
Serio us Adverse Reactions (SUSARS [Europe]) will be cross referenced according to local 
regulations to Janssen Investigational Compound Number (IND, CSA, etc)  at the time of 
submission.

medicinal product  
 
These safety events may not meet the definition of an adverse event; however, from a 
Janssen Scientific Affairs, LLC perspective, they are treated in the same manner as adverse 
events. Special situations should be record ed on the Adverse Event page of the CRF.  
 
Any special situation that meets the criteria of a serious adverse event should be recorded 
on a Serious Adverse Event Report Form and be reported to Janssen Scientific Affairs, LLC 
within 24 hours of becoming awar e of the event.  
 
 
 
9.9.4 PREGNANCY  
 
 All initial reports of pregnancy must be reported to Janssen Scientific Affairs, LLC by 
the PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR within 24 hours of becoming aware of the event using the 
Serious Adverse Event Form. Abnormal pregnancy outcomes (e.g. spontaneous abortion, fetal 
death, stillbirth, congenital anomaly, ectopic pregnancy) are considered serious adverse events 
and must be reported using the Serious Adverse Event Form.  
 
Any subject who becomes pregnant during the st udy must be promptly withdrawn from 
the study and discontinue further study treatment.  
Because the effects of daratumumab on sperm are unknown, pregnancies in partners of 
male subjects exposed to daratumumab will be reported by the PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR 
within 24 hours of their knowledge of the event using the Serious Adverse Event Form.  
Depending on local legislation this may require prior consent of the partner.

9.10.1  PREGNANCY  
 
 If a subject or spouse or partner of a subject becomes pregnant while enrolled in this 
clinical trial or up to three months following administration of carfilzomib, Amgen Drug Safety 
must be notified within 24 hours of the Investigator, designee, or site p ersonnel learning of the 
pregnancy (See Amgen Drug Safety and Pharmacovigilance Contact information above).  If the 
subject is pregnant, carfilzomib must be withheld.   
 
Females of childbearing potential should be advised to avoid  becoming pregnant while 
being treated with carfilzomib. If pregnancy occurs during this time, patients should be apprised 
of the potential hazard to the fetus. Carfilzomib should only be used du ring pregnancy if the 
potential benefits to the mother outweigh the potential risks to the fetus.  Carfilzomib can cause 
fetal harm when administered to  a pregnant woman. Carfilzomib caused embryo -fetal toxicity in 
pregnant rabbits at doses that were lower than in subjects receiving the recommended doses. If 
carfilzomib is used during pregnan cy , or if the subject becomes pregnant while taking 
carfilzomib, she should notifu the investigstor or study staff immediately.   
 
Subjects, spouses, or partners will be followed through the outcome of the pregnancy.  
The Investigator will be required to notify Amgen of the pregnancy and discuss follow -up with 
the subject . It is not known if carfilzomib will reduce the efficacy of oral contraceptives. Due to 
an increased risk  of venous thrombosis associated with carfilzomib, subjects currently using oral 
MONOCLONAL ANTIBODY -BASED SEQUENTIAL THERAPY FOR DEEP REMISSION IN MULTIPLE 
MYELOMA   
Confidential   February 12 , 2022 
 Page 96 of 126 contraceptives , or a hormonal method of contraception associated with a risk of thrombosis 
should consider an alternative method of contraception.   
 
All pregnancies are considered a SAE and will require expedite reporting. Investigators 
will follow the out come of the pregnancy for (spontaneous abortion,(any congenital anomaly 
detected in an aborted fetus is to be documented), stillbirth, neonatal death, or congenital 
anomaly  . 
 
Males of reproductive potential sho0uld be advised to avoid fathering a child wh ile being 
treated with carfilzomib.  The potential for carfilzomi b to be transferred via semen and its effect 
on sperm is unknown. Male subjects treated with carfilzomib   and/or their female partners (if of 
childbearing potential) should use effective cont raceptive methods or abstain from sexual 
activity while treated with carfilzomib and for 90 days after treatment. Male subjects shou9ld 
refrain from donating sperm while on carfilzomib and for 90 days after treatment.  
If pregnancy occurs during this time,  patients should be ap prised of the potential hazard to the 
fetus.  
Male subjects should be advised to inform the investigator or study staff immediately in 
the event that their female partner becomes pregnant during the study. Upon receipt of this 
informa tion, the investigator should notify Amgen of the pregnancy and discuss follow -up 
regarding the pregnancy outcome with the subject.  
 
No studies of carfilzomib have been conducted in breastfeeding women. Carfilzomib 
should not be used during breastfeeding.  Breastfeeding women and women planning on 
breastfeeding may not participate in clinical trials with carfilzomi b.  
 
It is not known whether carfilzomib is present i n human breast milk. Due to the  potential 
for adverse effects in nursing infants from carfil zomib , a decision should be made whether to 
discontinue nursing or to discontinue carfilzomib, taking into account the potential benefit of 
carfilzomib to the mother. If a woman breastfeeds during the study, she must inform the 
investigator or study staff  immediately. The investigator should notify Amgen that the subject 
has breastfed the infant and discuss the follow -up with the subject.

Due to limited  data on the safety of the specific combination of agents being studied in 
the induction phase, a safety lead -in was performed and include d 6 subjects. No dose limiting

 Page 99 of 126 toxicity was seen during the first 2 cycles in 2 or more subjects (in fact none of the first 6 
subjects experienced dose limiting toxicity). The study was reviewed by the data safety 
monitoring board that recommended accrual will continue at the initial dose level.  
 
The initial sample size considerations is based on Simon’s optimal two -stage design  
(optimum design) to estimate the rate of MRD negative cases upon completion of consolidation 
and reduce the early futility of the study. A  total of 6 7 evaluable patients wi ll be enrolled that 
will achieve 80% power (and alpha=0.05) to test  the primary hypothesis, i.e.  at least 15% more 
MRD negative in the experimental intervent ion than in the benchmark, ~60 % MRD negative in 
the KRD - auto-HCT  trial(45) and at least 75% MRD negative in the current protocol.  Twenty -
seven  patients will be enrolled in the first stage; the trial will be terminated if 17 or fewer  
patients become MRD negative in the first stage. Based on the null hypothesis that P<=0. 60 
versus the alternative that P>=0. 75, there is 69% probability  of early termination  if P=P0 .  If the 
trial goes on to the second stage, an additional 4 0 evaluable patients (total of 6 7 evaluable 
patients) will be studied. If the total number of subjects to become MRD negative is less than or 
equal to 46, the intervention will be considered futile. By accounting for ~20% of either patients 
drop out or subjects not informative for MRD, a total of 82 eligible patients will be required.  The 
size of the study (n=67 info rmative subjects) will provide two -sided 95% confidence intervals 
for MRD negative estimate from 62.5% in lower limit to 84.4% in upper limit using Clopper -
Pearson exact method for one proportion assuming the MRD negative rate is 75%  
10.3.1  STATISTICAL CONSIDERAT IONS  FOR STUDY EXPANSION  
 
As of August 2019 80 patients have been enrolled, 45 have  reached end of induction 
therapy and 25 have reached end of consolidation 1. Seventy -seven  of 80 patients (96%) are 
MRD evaluable (vs. ~80% originally estimated). Of the 23 patients who are MRD evaluable and 
are beyond consolidation 1, 18 (78%) have reached primary endpoint (vs. 75% originally 
estimated).  The proportion of patients reaching primary endpoint is expected to increase as 
patients advance to consolidation 2 and 3 . Therefore, with 18/23 patients already meeting 
primary endpoint, the study did not meet criteria for early termination  during first stage of 
Simon’s two stage design. (17 or fewer patients reaching primary endpoint among the first 27 
evaluable).

MYELOMA   
Confidential   February 12 , 2022 
 Page 100 of 126  
Upon  approval of protocol ammendment #4, the trial will be expanded to include a total 
of 123 patients (therefore 41 patients in addition to the 82 patients anticipated in original 
protocol and amendments 1, 2 and 3) in order to enable the exploratory objectiv e. Accrual will 
only continue if the study does not meet criteria for futility upon completion of Simon’s 
second stage (i.e. 46 or fewer patients reach primary endpoint  at completion of second stage 
among the first 67 MRD evaluable  patients ).    
 
The explo ratory objective is to describe progression -free survival (PFS)of high -risk [HR; 
i.e. myeloma cells harboring del17p or t(4;14) or t(14;16) ]and standard risk (SR) patients 
reaching confirmed MRD negative status (10-5) and  discontinuing therapy. High-risk patients 
account for a minority subset of patients with NDMM (currently at 27.5% in this study, 15 -20% 
in most trials for NDMM) and are also less likely to achieve MRD negative status upon therapy. 
Therefore, in order to f ulfill the exploratory objective of the study, some enrichment of the 
cohort for high -risk patients is necessary. In order to estimate the optimal accrual of HR and SR 
patients we assumed the rate of MRD evaluable patients to be 95% (consistent with curren t 
findings), the proportion of SR patients who achieve confirmed MRD negative status to be 85% 
and the proportion of HR  patients who achieve confirmed MRD negative status to be 75%. 
Different scenarios utilizing these parameters are displayed in Table 11.  The scenario with 65% 
patients evaluable for exploratory objective being SR and 35% being HR patients provides the 
best balance between HR enrichment and duration of enrollment. This scenario anticipates a total 
of 77 SR and 46 HR patients being accrued  (Figure below) so effectively 37.4% of accrued 
patients being HR  (46/123) to yield 62 SR and 33 HR patients with confirmed MRD negative 
status and evaluable for exploratory objective.

Upon activation of protocol ammendment #4 the UAB CTNMO  will ensure that 
enrollment does not exceed 77 standard risk patients and 46 high risk patients. Once accrual 
target is reached for one of the risk categories (e.g SR) accrual will only continue in the other 
risk category.  
 
 Based on data from patients reaching MRD negativity followed by observation described 
from the IFM 2009 trial (21), we estimate the 2 -year PFS (from discontinuation of therapy) of 
patients with confirmed MRD negativity to  be ≥ 75% for both HR and SR patients. Table 12 
provides confidence interval for  a few  different possibilities of 2 -year PFS for HR and SR 
cohorts.

10.4 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  
 
10.4.1  GENERAL STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  
  
Continuous endpoints will be summarized using descriptive statistics, which will include 
the number of patients with a valid measurement (n), mean, standard deviation, median, 
minimum, and maximum. All categorical endpoints will be summarized using frequen cies and 
percentages. The safety endpoints will be listed and/or summarized by relevant time points, as 
appropriate. In general, the baseline value for efficacy and safety variables is the last non -
missing value before the first dose of study treatment. Da ta listings will be created to support 
each table and to present all data.  Statistical analysis  will be done with SAS v.10.3.  
 
10.4.2  MISSING DATA HANDLING  
 
No imputation of values for missing data will be performed except that missing or partial 
start and end d ates for AEs and concomitant medication will be imputed according to pre  
specified, conservative imputation rules. Subjects lost to follow -up (or drop out) will be included 
in statistical analyses to the point of their last evaluation.  
 
10.4.3  ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY  
 
 
All enrolled subjects who receive ≥ 1 dose of study drug will be included the safety 
analysis. Safety assessments will consist of monitoring and recording DLTs, AEs and SAEs; 
measurements of protocol -specified hematology, clinical ch emistry, urinalysis, and other 
MONOCLONAL ANTIBODY -BASED SEQUENTIAL THERAPY FOR DEEP REMISSION IN MULTIPLE 
MYELOMA   
Confidential   February 12 , 2022 
 Page 104 of 126 laboratory variables; measurement of protocol -specified vital signs; and other protocol -specified 
tests that are deemed critical to the safety evaluation of the study drug(s).  
 
Safety summaries will include summaries in the f orm of tables and listings. The 
frequency (number and percentage) of treatment emergent AEs will be reported by Medical 
Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) System Organ Class and Preferred Term. 
Summaries will also be presented by the severity of  the AE (per Common Terminology Criteria 
For Adverse Events [CTCAE],v4.03) and by relationship to study drug.  
 
Laboratory shift tables containing counts and percentages will be prepared by treatment 
assignment, laboratory parameter, and time. Summary table s will be prepared for each laboratory 
parameter. Figures of changes in laboratory parameters over time will be generated.  
Results of vital sign assessments and physical exams will be tabulated and summarized.  
 
Additional analyses will include summaries of  subject demographics, baseline 
characteristics, compliance, and concurrent treatments. Concomitant medications will be coded 
and tabulated according to the World Health Organization Drug Dictionary (WHODRUG).  
 
 
10.4.4  ANALYSIS OF EFFICACY PARAMETERS  
 
 
The primary endpoint of M RD (-) rate will be estimated along with two -sided 95% CI 
using Clopper -Pearson exact method. The same method will be used to estimate rate of negative 
MRD at completion of induction; rate of conversion from positive to negative MRD wi th auto -
HCT , rate of attainment  of CR upon completion of consolidation  and rate and kinetics of 
conversion from negative MRD to positive MRD upon treatment discontinuation.  
 
Time -to-event endpoints will be analyzed using Kaplan -Meier product limit methods to 
estimate the survival distribution, median time -to-event with 95% confidence interval, patients at 
MONOCLONAL ANTIBODY -BASED SEQUENTIAL THERAPY FOR DEEP REMISSION IN MULTIPLE 
MYELOMA   
Confidential   February 12 , 2022 
 Page 105 of 126 risk, patients with an event, patients censored and survival probabilities at selected time points. 
Progression -free survival (PFS) is defined as the inte rval from the start of therapy to the earlier 
of the following events: documentation of objective disease progression  (appendix B), initiation 
of any non -protocol anti -myeloma therapy with exception of single agent lenalidomide in dose 
up to 15 mg/day (acc epted maintenance therapy)  or death from any cause. For the exploratory 
objective of describing PFS for patients with confirmed MRD negative status who discontinue 
therapy, PFS will be defined as the interval from discontinuation of therapy (and initiation  of 
observation) until the earliest of the following events:  documentation of objective disease 
progression  (appendix B), initiation of any anti -myeloma therapy or death from any cause.  
Kaplan -Meier methods will be used to estimate the event -free curves an d corresponding qua rtiles 
(including the median). Data from surviving, non -progressing subjects will be censored at the 
earliest of the time of initiation of antitumor treatment other than the study treatment or the last 
time that lack of disease progression was objectively d ocumented.  
 
Overall survival (OS) is defined as the time from date of enrollment until date of death 
due to any cause. Subjects who are known to be alive or whose survival status is unknown will 
be censored at the date last known to be alive. Subjects who  are completely lost to follow -up for 
survival will be censored at enrollment date. The analysis methods for overall survival will be 
similar to those described for progression free survival.  
 
10.4.5  INTERIM AND SAFETY ANALYSIS  
 
There will be continuous monitori ng for safety.  A sequential probability ratio test 
(SPRT) approach will be used (49).  If there is strong evidence that the rate of grade 4 non-
hematologic toxicities is 0.30 or above,  as compared to a null rate of 0.15, the enrollment  will be 
halt and a full DSMC review will be conducted.   The stopping boundary is based on the 
likelihood ratio comparing the null rate of 0.30 versus the alternative rate of 0.15 using binomial 
likelihood s.  If the ratio favoring a rate of 0.30 (vs. 0.15) ever exceeds 10, then the study will be 
stopped.  A likelihood ratio of 10 is similar to a significance level of 0.05.

13.1 PROTOCOL AMENDMENTS AND STUDY COMPLETION  
13.1.1 PROTOCOL AMENDMENTS  
No modifications will be made to the protocol without the agreement of the sponsor -
investigator. Changes that significantly affect the safety of the patients, the scope of the 
investigation, or the scientific quality of the study will require Institutional Review Board 
approval prior to implementation, except whe re the modification is necessary to eliminate 
apparent immediate hazard to human subjects.  Any departures from the protocol must be fully 
documented in the protocol deviation case report form and the source documentation .  
13.1.2 STUDY COMPLETION  
The foll owing data and materials are required by UAB CTNMO , Amgen and Janssen  
before a study can be considered complete or terminated:  
1. Copies of protocol amendments and IRB approval/notification, if appropriate.  
2. Copies of the IRB final report, documentation of su bmission to the IRB.  
3. A summary of the study prepared by the Principal Investigator (Study report, 
manuscript and/or abstract).  
4. All regulatory documents (e.g.,  updated curriculum vitae for each Principal 
Investigator, updated U.S. FDA Form 1572 for each si te). 
13.2 STUDY DOCUMENTATION AND ARCHIVE  
13.2.1 DATA RECORDING  
The Clinical Research Coordinator and Investigator will be responsible for the recording 
of all data on the electronic Case Report Forms ( eCRFs)  on OnCore system .  
The Investigator will provide ac cess to his/her original records to permit a representative 
from the funding or auditing institution(s) to verify the proper transcription of data.  Data 
submission will be electronically via Fax or email .

13.2.2 RECORD RETENTION  
Federal law requires tha t an Investigator maintain all study records for two years after the 
investigation is discontinued.  
13.3 STUDY MONITORING AND DATA COLLECTION  
13.3.1 MONITORING  
UAB CTNMO will be responsible for the monitoring of study patient data and records. 
Monitoring will be performed centrally. All monitoring reports will be kept by the UAB 
CTNMO to ensure that all reports are contained in a central study file. The CTNMO manager or 
UAB internal auditor will be responsible for conducting the review of monitoring packets. A 
final monitoring report will be generated and issued to the site and will be kept in the central 
study file by the  UAB CTNMO . 
13.3.1.1  Frequency of Reviews  
The each patient at each participating center will have their eligibility criteria reviewed 
prior to enrollment by the UAB CTNMO .  
During the course of the study, each site will be selected for an audit  by the UAB Quality 
Assurance Committee  approximately once a yea r. Audit will include 10% of the subjects 
enrolled at the site . In addition to the once yearly QA audit, monitoring for each patient entered 
into this trial will be 100%. Sites are to send source information on each patient to the UAB 
CTNMO office where a shadow chart will be maintained on each subject for this trial.  Source 
will be verified to data entered into the OnCore  database.  
13.3.2 PROTOCOL DEVIATIONS AND SAFETY REPORTING  
A Protocol Deviation is any variance from the protocol involving a subject or subjects 
that is not approved by the IRB prior to its initiation or implementation, and occurs when a 
member of the study team departs from the IRB -approved protocol in any way w ithout the 
investigator first obtaining IRB approval.  
MONOCLONAL ANTIBODY -BASED SEQUENTIAL THERAPY FOR DEEP REMISSION IN MULTIPLE 
MYELOMA   
Confidential   February 12 , 2022 
 Page 117 of 126 Any protocol deviation or serious adverse event will be reported by the subsite within 24 
hours  of notification. Protocol Deviations will be reported by completion of the hard copy 
Protocol Deviation Re port form.  Serious Adverse Events will be reported by completion of a 
MedWatch 3500A form and hard copy Serious Adverse Event form. For both Protocol 
Deviations and Serious Adverse Events, all required forms and any supporting clinical 
documentation shoul d be submitted to the UAB CTNMO office within 10 days of notification.  
13.3.3 DATA SAFETY MONITORING BOARD  
The University of Alabama Comprehensive Cancer Center Data Safety Monitoring Board 
will have oversight of the protocol. The UAB CCC  DSMB will meet a t a minimum on a monthly 
basis to discuss hematology related trials.  
In addition, all protocol deviations and SAEs as defined above will be reviewed by the 
UAB CCC  DSMB for review during the DSMB monthly meetings. The coordinating center will 
review protocol deviation and SAE events for form completion and provide assistance in 
communicating to the subsite if more information is warranted. The UAB CTNMO  will report  
the event report to the UAB CCC  DSMB so that the information can be reviewed at the next 
available DSMB meeting. During the DSMB review, the DSMB can make recommendations for 
any further study action.  
 
13.3.4 DATA COLLECTION   
Data collection will be manag ed by the UAB CTNMO staff via the study database which is 
housed and maintained at UAB Cancer Center.   
 
 
Time sensitive information such as patient registration, serious adverse events reporting, 
and protocol deviation reporting will be collected via compl eted hard copy form. These forms 
are available  from the UAB CTNMO. . Information collected will be reviewed and processed by 
the UAB CTNMO . 
The data will be initially reviewed for quality assurance purposes to identify any 
discrepancies or missing data. Th e staff of the UAB CTNMO  will notify the participating site of 
MONOCLONAL ANTIBODY -BASED SEQUENTIAL THERAPY FOR DEEP REMISSION IN MULTIPLE 
MYELOMA   
Confidential   February 12 , 2022 
 Page 118 of 126 any data queries and manage the overall data quality of the study. If data received relates to a 
serious adverse event or protocol deviation, the information will be processed for report to the  
UAB CCC  DSMB for review. The sponsor - investigator, Luciano Costa, MD and the assigned 
statistician,  will also have access to study data for quality assurance and analysis purposes. 
During the course of the study, data quality will be monitored by random inspection of the 
completed forms by a designated monitor.  Any problems detected will be discussed with the PI. 
If necessary, re -training of data collectors will be conducted.  
All data should be substantiated by clinical source documents organized within a patient 
research record. ICH Good Clinical Practices are to be followed.   The study will be subject to a 
yearly internal audit via the UAB CCC Quality Assurance Committee  at a minimum and audits 
may occur more frequently at the request o f the QA Committee .

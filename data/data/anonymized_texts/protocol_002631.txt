conduction system abnormalities.  
13. Any serious medical or psychiatric illness that could, in the 
investigator’s opinion, potentially interfere with the 
completion of treatment according to this protocol.  
Study Rationale  We earlier hypothesized and demonstrated that tocilizumab  could 
attenuate the incidence of aGVHD after MAC and RIC alloHCT, 
using matched sibling or unrelated donor. In this study, we 
hypothesize that longer term IL -6 inhibition through treatment  with 
tocilizumab  by repeated dosing would mediate a beneficial effect not 
only on the risk of aGVHD, but also on chronic GVHD. This will be 
achieved by administering an additional dose of tocilizumab  at Day 
+100 post -alloHCT, besides the pretransplant dose, as done in our 
previous clinical trial, thereby providing total prophylaxis against 
both acute and chronic GVHD.  
Primary Objectives  1. Determine the probability of GVHD/relapse- free survival 
(GRFS) defined as survival without grade III -IV acute GVHD, 
IIT-Chhabra- Proactive  7 Version No. 4  
  Version Date: 09/19 /2019  systemic therapy -requiring chronic GVHD, relapse, or death 
at 12 months after matched related/unrelated donor bone 
marrow or peripheral blood alloHCT using myeloablative 
conditioning (MAC).  
Secondary Objectives  1. C umulative incidence of mild, moderate and severe chronic 
GVHD (by NIH criteria) and limited or extensive chronic 
GVHD (by conventional criteria).   
2. C umulative incidence of grade II -IV acute GVHD at Days 
+100 and +180 . 
3. C umulative incidence of grade III -IV acute GVHD at Day s    
           +100  and +180. 
4. I ncidence of primary and secondary graft failure.  
5. Probability of  non-relapse mortality post -alloHCT.  
6. Cumulative incidence of  relapse/progression of the primary  
            malignancy.  
7. Probability of PFS post -HCT. 
8. Probability of OS post-HCT. 
9. T cell and myeloid chimerism kinetics following alloHCT at 
Day + 28. 
10.     Immune reconstitution following alloHCT at Day  +28, Day 
+100, Day +180, and Day +365 . 
11.   Patient -reported Quality of Life assessments at baseline 
(enrollment), Day s +28, +100, +180 and +365 post-
transplant.   
12a. Effect of GVHD prophylaxis on gut microbiome 
diversity: Difference in the level of microbiome 
diversity during transplant.  
12b. Association of baseline gut microbiome diversity wit h 
development of aGVHD, cGVHD,  and over all 
survival. 
Endpoints  Primary endpoint: The primary endpoint of this trial is GRFS. An 
event for this outcome is defined as grade III -IV acute GVHD, 
systemic therapy requiring chronic GVHD, relapse, or death . 
Patients who are alive without GVHD will be censored at the last 
follow- up.  
Secondary endpoints:  
• Acute GVHD 
• Chronic GVHD  
• Hematopoietic Recovery

Study Design  This is a phase II open -label trial designed to evaluate the efficacy 
of tocilizumab  in improving GRFS after allogeneic hematopoietic cell 
transplantation (alloHCT) for hematologic malignancy.  
Study Agent/
Intervention 
Description  Patients enrolled on the clinical trial will rec eive tacrolimus initiating 
at Day -1 at doses to maintain therapeutic levels per institutional 
preference and continued until at least Day +90 post -transplant. 
Methotrexate will be administered intravenously and dosed at 15 
mg/m2 Day +1 and 10 mg/m2 Days +3, +6 and +11. Tocilizumab  will 
be administered intravenously at a dose of 8 mg/kg on Day  -1 and  
at day +100 (+/ - 14 days).  
Number of Subjects  32 
Subject Participation 
Duration  Patients will be followed for at least 12 months following alloHCT.  
Duration  of Follow up  Patients will be followed indefinitely for survival following alloHCT.  
Estimated Time to 
Complete Enrollment:  The estimated accrual period is 18 months . 
Statistical Methodology:  
 The sample size was selected to achieve 80% power to detect an 
increase in GRFS at 12 months to 40% compared to a historical 
control value of 20% at a one- sided 5% significance level. Based on 
asymptotic z -test for proportions, 29 patients with a known outcome 
are needed (i.e ., known GVHD, relapse, or death status at 12 
months).  Accounting for the drop out rate of 10%, a total of 32 
patients will be enrolled on the study.  
Analysis of primary endpoint  
The GRFS will be estimated using the Kaplan- Meier estimator and 
plotted with a 95% confidence band. An event f or this outcome is 
defined as grade III -IV acute GVHD, chronic GVHD requiring 
IIT-Chhabra- Proactive  9 Version No. 4  
  Version Date: 09/19 /2019  systemic therapy, relapse or death . Patients who are alive without 
GVHD will be censored at the last follow- up. The 12- month GRFS 
will be compared to the prespecified historical control value of 20% 
using a one- sided z-test. 
Analysis of secondary endpoints  
Demographic and other baseline data , such as disease 
characteristics, as well as outcome measures , will be presented 
overall and separately for URD and MRD patients. Categorical  data, 
such as gender, race, etc., will be presented by frequencies and 
percentages. Descriptive summary statistics (e.g. , frequency, mean, 
median, range and standard deviation) will be used to present 
numeric data.  
Time -to-event outcomes with and without competing risks will be 
analyzed using Kaplan- Meier and Nelson- Aalen estimates, 
respectively, and presented with 95% confidence intervals. Binary outcomes will be analyzed using proportions with 95% confidence 
intervals.

*Indicate evaluations are currently performed as standard of care at the MCW  BMT  program .  
1, 2 CBC with differential, comprehensive metabolic panel will be performed as appropriate during hospitalization for alloHCT and on clinic visits and 
at minimum performed on days indicated on the schedule of events.  CBC will be checked weekly until neutrophil and platelet recovery.  
3 Infectious disease titers include: CMV, hepatitis panel (hepA ab, hepB SAb, hepB SAg, hepB Core Ab, hepC Ab), HIV and HTLV I/II antibody . 
4 Evaluation of the malignant disease: for acute leukemia, CML and MDS this includes a bone marrow aspirate and biopsy for morphology, 
cytogenetics/ FISH and molecular testing as appropriate. For lymphomas , this includes imaging studies, which will be done according to institutional 
practices, or the same as prior to transplant, for matter of comparison.  
5 Pregnancy test must be performed < 30 days before the start of the transplant conditioning for females of childbearing potential and may be 
performed per institutional practices.  (Serum or Urine)  
6 GVHD assessments performed per the standard operating procedures at the MCW BMT Program, and at minimum on Day  + 28, +56, +100 , +180, 
+365.  The GVHD assessment will include a review of all abnormalities experienced during the entire assessment period  and t he highest grade  
for each abnormality ( whether attributed to GVHD or not ) during the assessment period will be recorded.  
7 The AE assessment will include a review of all  toxicities  including infections  experienced during the entire assessment period and the highest 
grade for each AE during the assessment period will be recorded on the AE forms.

10 LVEF to be estimated by MUGA or transthoracic echocardiogram.   
11 First stool sample for microbiome studies will be collected after admission in the hospital pre- transplant. Subsequent samples will be collected on 
Day+1±2, D ay+7 ±2, D ay+15± 2, Day+21± 2, and until neutrophil engraftment (last stool sample will be collected after neutrophil engraftment).  
12 Stool sample will also be collected at the time of onset of acute or chronic GVHD.   
† Tocililzumab will be dose at  8 mg/kg (maximum dose of 800 mg) once on the Day -1 approximately 24 hours prior to the estimated time of the 
hematopoietic cell infusion, and subsequently, on Day +100 (+/ - 14 days, i.e., Days +86 to +114) post -alloHCT. The weight used to calculate the 
dose will be within 7 days of first dose of tocilizumab. Only i f the patient’s weight has changed >10% (over the baseline weight), then the dosage of 
tocilizumab (for the second dose) will be changed depending on the weight checked within 14 days prior to the second dose.

1.1 Graft -versus- Host Disease 
Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (alloHCT), a curative therapy for hematologic 
malignancies, acts by mediating immunologic graft-versus- tumor effects against the malignancy. 
Unfortunately, these immune responses can also be directed toward normal host tissues, resulting in acute graft -versus -host disease (GVHD) . 
1 GVHD is classified as either acute or 
chronic GVHD , based on clinical characteristics . 2 According to the clinical definitions, classic 
acute GVHD (aGVHD) develops within 100 days posttransplant with distinctive clinical features in the skin, gastrointestinal (GI) tract, or liver. However, manifestations of aGVHD can reoccur, persist, or present after Day 100 posttransplant and is then classified as recurrent, persistent or 
late onset aGVHD. Classical chronic GVHD is not limited to a specific organ system and can 
present at any time after transplantation. The diagnosis of chronic GVHD is based on consensus criteria for each organ system involved. While some clinical features are diagnostic (e.g., bronchiolitis obliterans and sclerotic features of the skin), other manifestations require additional clinical and/or histological criteria to be fulfilled. Some patients may also present as 
an overlap syndrome with clinical features of both acute and chronic GVHD (cGVHD). Scoring systems have been developed to grade the severity of aGVHD , based on the involvement of 
skin, GI tract and liver: Glucksberg scale (grading aGVHD from I to IV) is most widely used 
3 
(see Appendix A). Importantly, aGVHD, although T- cell dependent, is known to be mediated, at 
least in part, by inflammatory cytokines . 4 By contrast, the mechanistic pathway in cGVHD 
involves Th17 differentiation 5 and germinal center B cells . 6 
 The development of GVHD is a three -step process, each involving different subsets of immune 
cells. 
7,8 The first step is activation of the innate immune system; this results in a state of 
systemic inflammation prior to the introduction of donor T cells. The chemotherapy and/or radiation used in the conditioning therapy invoke tissue damage with release of proinflammatory cytokines, e.g., IL- 1, TNF -α, IFN -γ and IL -6. These cytokines perpetuate GVHD through direct 
cytotoxic effects on host tissues , 
9-11 activation and/or priming of immune effector cells 12 and 
differentiation of proinflammatory and pathogenic alloantigen- specific T cell populations (i.e. , 
TH1 and TH17 cells) from naïve T cell precursors . 4,13,14 Damage to the GI barrier allows 
increased translocation of microorganisms from the gut microbiome, with subsequent increased levels of circulating lipopolysaccharide, as well as molecules with pathogen- and damage -
associated molecular patterns (PAMPs/DAMP s). 
15 Consequently, antigen- presenting cells 
IIT-Chhabra- Proactive  18 Version No. 4  
  Version Date: 09/19 /2019  (APC) secrete proinflammatory cytokines and present host , as well as pathogen peptides on 
their major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules. A reduction of pretransplant 
inflammation (e.g., using reduced intensity conditioning (RIC), reduction of gut microbiome levels) and the presence of genetic factors associated with reduced inflammatory responses are associated with a reduced risk of GVHD and transplant -related mortality (TRM) . 
16-18 
 The second step is characterized by alloreactive T cell activation, proliferation and differentiation as a response to the presentation of host antigens by host APC in a proinflammatory context. Stimulation of specific T helper cell subsets is thought to be important for the initiation of later cytotoxic T -cell mediated tissue damage . 
7,8 Th1 cells release IFN -γ and express the 
transcription factors STAT4 and STAT1/T -bet. 19,20 This Th1 polarization seems to be important 
for the development of aGVHD, especially in the GI tract . 11 Th2 cells characterized by 
expression of the transcription factor GATA -3 and secretion of anti -inflammatory cytokines IL -4, 
IL-10, and IL -13 21 also may play a role in GVHD pathogenesis . 11,22,23 Th17 cells are 
characterized by the expression of the transcription factor RORγt and IL -17 secretion, 24 and are 
thought to be important for aGVHD severity 25 and early transplant -related severe lung injury . 26 
A majority o f early posttransplant circulating TCRαβ+ CD4+ and CD8+ T cells release IL -6 at 
relatively high levels together with classical proinflammatory cytokines , such as IFN -γ and 
TNFα. 27 Finally, T regulatory cells (Tregs) are a Th subset characterized by expression of the 
transcription factor FOXP3 and high IL- 2R (CD25) expression. These cells play an important 
regulatory role by actively suppressing immune responses through their release of the anti -
inflammatory cytoki nes IL- 10, TGF -β and IL- 35, 28 and through direct interaction with other T cell 
subsets. Tregs are suppressed during GVHD, and resolution of GVHD is associated with 
restoration of the Treg function. 29 The inflammatory environment in GVHD is promoted by the 
absence of an effective Treg response as both a relative and an absolute decline of Tregs in the 
peripheral blood and target tissues have been demonstrated in most studies . 13,30-32 The strong 
association between a proinflammatory milieu and the absence of an effective counter -
regulatory response suggests that the inflammatory environment prevents or inhibits Treg reconstitution during GVHD.  
 
The third step of GVHD development is characterized by local action of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells triggered by the local release of chemokines during the two first steps. These cells mediate 
direct cytotoxic effects upon target cell recognition, including secretion of perforin/granzyme and 
FAS- ligand. Other T cell subsets contribute to the organ -specific manifestations of GVHD 
IIT-Chhabra- Proactive  19 Version No. 4  
  Version Date: 09/19 /2019  through polarization of macrophages toward a proinflammatory (M1) phenotype that further 
increases tissue damage through the release of oxidants and proinflammatory cytokines , 
including TNF- α and IL-6. 33,34 
 A combination of a calcineurin inhibitor (tacrolimus (Tac) or cyclosporine (CSP)) and 
methotrexate (MTX) has been an accepted standard for prevention of GVHD. Despite 
prophylaxis, the incidence of grade II –IV acute GVHD (aGVHD) is 35  to 50% 
35 and the rate of 
chronic GVHD is 40 to 60%. The occurrence of GVHD after alloHCT results in increased 
transplant -related mortality (TRM), which also affects overall survival (OS) 36. The risk increases 
with unrelated or partially HLA- matched donors due to the greater genetic disparity between 
donor and recipient. Thus, new therapeutic treatment strategies are needed for prevention of 
acute, as well as chronic GVHD.  
 1.2 Interleukin-6 
IL-6, a glyco sylated protein with a molecular weight of 21 -28 kDa,
37 is a pleiotropic cytokine that 
is produced by a variety of cell types, including T cells, B cells, fibroblasts, endothelial cells,  
macrophages, monocytes and keratinocytes . 38 Macrophages and monocytes appear to be the 
main sources of IL- 6 during acute inflammation, while T cells seem to be a major contributor 
during chronic inflammation. 39 The systemic (serum/plasma) levels usually range from 1.8 to 14 
pg/ml in healthy individuals . 40,41 During inflammation, a more than 105- fold increase can be 
observed, often correlating with disease sev erity. 42 IL-6 is essential for maturation, proliferation, 
differentiation and maintenance of B cells/plasma cells and several proinflammatory T- cell 
subsets.  
 With respect to GVHD biology, IL -6 sits at the crossroads where the fate of naïve T cells to 
become proinflammatory T cells or Tregs is determined. In the presence of IL- 6 and 
transforming growth factor -
β (TGF -β), naïve T cells differentiate into TH17 cells, whereas in its 
absence, Tregs are induced. 43,44 IL-6 produced by dendritic cells after activation through Toll -
like receptors is, in addition, abl e to inhibit the suppressive function of Tregs . 45,46 Thus, IL- 6 
appears to have a pivotal role in directing the immune response toward an inflammatory phenotype and away from a regulatory response. Second, IL -6-signaling is crucial for trafficking 
of immune  cells to inflamed tissues and lymphoid organs. This is caused both by altered 
expression of adhesion molecules by endothelial cells and by expression of their ligands by immunocompetent cells. Third, IL- 6 has important functions in GVHD target organs, and there 
IIT-Chhabra- Proactive  20 Version No. 4  
  Version Date: 09/19 /2019  may, therefore, be a risk of combined injury during GVHD (e.g., GVHD -induced immunologic 
damage, pharmacologic toxicity and IL -6 inhibition). Finally, IL -6, together with TNF- α released 
from macrophages , has been reported to directly/independently contribute to tissue damage in 
GVHD. 33  
 
The importance of IL -6 in GVHD is also supported by clinical studies showing increased 
incidence and severity of GVHD in patients with elevated plasma levels of IL-6, 47,48 and in those 
with a recip ient or donor IL- 6 genotype that results in increased IL -6 production. 49,50 IL-6 also is 
important in regulation of stem cells and tissue regeneration in several organs . 2 This has been 
best demonstrated for hematopoiesis, liver cells, GI mucosa and muscle cells. Impaired IL- 6 
function in these organs is associated with reduced regeneration after injury, and IL -6 
dysregulation during chronic inflammation can contribute to organ dysfunction.  
 
Signaling through IL- 6 occurs by its binding to a low -affinity IL -6 receptor (IL- 6R). 51 IL-6R exists 
both in a membrane- bound (mIL -6R) and a soluble form (sIL- 6R). The binding of IL- 6 to IL- 6R 
induces homodimerization of gp130 cell membrane protein for intra-cellular signal transduction.
52 mIL-6R is only expressed by a limited number of cell types, including 
hepatocytes, hematopoietic cells (neutrophils, naïve T cells, macrophages) and a subset of intestinal epithelial cells. IL- 6R signaling can be initiated in these cells through the membr ane-
associated complex of IL -6, IL-6R and gp130. This is called classical signaling and is often 
associated with tissue regeneration and anti -inflammatory effects . 
2,52 IL-6R can also be shed 
from the membrane, generating a soluble form of the receptor , which can bind IL- 6 and induce 
an intracellular response in any tissue expressing gp130 through a process called trans -
signaling. 53,54 Thus, cells that do not express the IL- 6R themselves can be IL- 6 responsive and 
this seems important for many of the proinflammatory effects of IL-6. 37 sIL-6R is mainly formed 
through cleavage of mIL -6R by a disintegrin and metalloprotease (ADAM) 10 and 17 proteases. 
sIL-6R is constitutively released by liver and hematopoietic cells, but activation of ADAM17 
during inflammation causes a rapid local increase in sIL- 6R levels. The trans -signaling pathway 
is highly inflammatory, while classic signaling in cells directly expressing IL- 6R is crucial for the 
differentiation of donor T cells down a Th17 pathway, which is capable of mediating GVHD . 37,55 
 
Gp130 is noncovalently associated with the Janus kinases (JAKs) JAK1, JAK2 and TYK2. 
Following receptor ligation, the JAKs are auto -phosphorylated, and they also phosphorylate 
gp130. This phosphorylation provides docking sites for phosphorylation of STAT1, STAT3 and 
IIT-Chhabra- Proactive  21 Version No. 4  
  Version Date: 09/19 /2019  the tyrosine phosphatase SHP -2. Phosphorylated STAT3 dimerizes and is translocated to the 
nucleus where it acts as a transcription factor . 56 SHP-2 activates the RAS/RAF/MAPK/ERK 
pathway, whereas gp130 activation also leads to activation of the PI3K -AKT pathway together 
with the transcriptional regulator YAP1. Most of the IL -6 effects seem to be STAT3- mediated. 
STAT3 is controlled by a negative feedback mechanism; it induces expression of SOCS 
proteins and activation of the SHP- 2 phosphatase. SOCS3 then binds with high affinity to the 
same phosphorylated binding site on gp130 as JAK1/2 and thereby inhibits further intracellular 
signaling. IL- 6 signaling is also inhibited by internalization and degradation of the receptor 
complex and internalization of gp130 prevents further signaling.  
 1.3 IL- 6 Blockade and GVHD:  Preclinical Studies  
The role of IL- 6 in acute and chronic GVHD has been investigated in several mouse models. 
Givon et al. 
57 examined the effect of IL- 6 on bone marrow reconstitution after syngeneic and 
alloHCT and found that posttransplant treatment with subcutaneous recombinant IL- 6 
significantly supported white blood count reconstitution and improved survival in syngeneic and allogenic models transplanted with a low stem cell dose. In contrast, mice receiving IL -6 showed 
increases in both the severity of and mortality from GVHD. Chen et al.  
58 observed increased 
systemic IL -6 and IL- 6R levels early after both syngeneic and allogeneic transplantation. These 
levels returned to baseline over time in the syngeneic group, whereas IL- 6 levels remained high 
in mice developing GVHD. Both IL -6 and IL -6R expression increased in the liver and colon and 
the highest IL- 6R mRNA levels were observed in these two organs.  
 Selective IL -6 knockout in neither recipient nor donor cells were sufficient to protect from GVHD. 
However, GVHD treatment with anti -IL-6 resulted in significantly l ess weight loss, less 
histopathological evidence of damage to colon, liver and lungs, and significantly increased Treg levels in the spleen. The increased Treg levels were not dependent on an intact thymus; rather the IL- 6 blockade increased peripheral generation of Treg cells and reduced the levels  of Th1 
and Th17 cells. Similar results were shown by Noguchi et al. ; 
59 treatment with an anti -IL-6 
antibody reduced liver enzyme levels and occurrence of organ failure and was associated with reduced infiltration of Th1 and Th17 cells, increased Tregs and improved survival.  
 Tawara et al. 
60 investigat ed the effect of IL -6 derived from donor T cells. Selective IL -6 
knockout in donor/graft T cells was associated with less severe GVHD and prolonged survival. Pretransplant anti -IL-6 treatment also significantly improved survival and clinical as well as 
IIT-Chhabra- Proactive  22 Version No. 4  
  Version Date: 09/19 /2019  histopathologic severity of GVHD, but the Tregs were not altered. Importantly, the GVT effect 
was maintained despite the reduction in GVHD. The systemic cytokine levels and the levels of 
circulating cells were not altered. Selective ablation of IL -6 in recipi ent bone marrow cells did not 
reduce the incidence or severity of GVHD.  
 
Organ -specific effects of IL -6 in GVHD have been investigated in mouse models. Varelias et al. 
26 examined the role of IL -6 in idiopathic pulmonary syndrome (IPS) after alloHCT and 
demonstrated that local IL- 6 secretion induced Th17 cell differentiation that was necessary for 
disease development. IPS could be prevented by IL- 17 knockout or using anti -IL-17 antibody. 
Le Huu et al. 61 investigated the role of IL- 6 in a sclerodermatous cGVHD model and observed 
increased IL- 6 during disease progression. Treatment with anti -IL-6 antibody prior to 
manifestations of scleroderma significantly decreased the severity, while no reduction was 
observed when IL -6 blockade was started after the onset of cGVHD. Treatment with anti -IL-6 
was associated with a significant increase in the number of splenic Treg cells, whereas the 
expression of IFN -γ, TNFα, IL -6, IL-18, TGF -β1, CCL2, CCL3 and CCL5 in affected skin was 
significantly reduced.  
 
The role of STAT3 in the regulation of activation and differentiation of Tregs and Th17 cells after alloHCT has been investigated in several mouse models (i.e., STAT3- knockout mice) and in 
vitro models. Emerging evidence also suggests that activation of STATs in B cells is also 
important for GVHD . 
62 Several important observations suggest that targeting of IL -
6/JAK2/STAT3 signaling may be effective in preventing GVHD . 63-67 As has been demonstrated 
in our previous clinical trial, IL -6 blockade using tocilizumab  is an effective GVHD preventative 
strategy since IL -6 and STAT3 activation are closely linked to the development of  both Th17 
and Treg cells, and since early STAT3 phosphorylation posttransplant seems to precede development of GVHD . 
66 Currently available clinical data indicate that IL -6 blockade is most 
effective when used as GVHD prophylaxis, whereas manifest GVHD is likely less susceptible to the effects of IL -6 blockade.  
 1.4  Tocilizumab  
Tocilizumab (Actemra
TM) is a humanized anti -IL-6R antibody that blocks IL -6 signaling and has 
been FDA  approved for the treatment of severe active rheumatoid arthritis. It has been shown to 
have remission- inducing efficacy in patients with moderate- to-severe rheumatoid arthritis, 
systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis and multicentric Castleman’s disease. 68,69 A pilot phase I/II 
IIT-Chhabra- Proactive  23 Version No. 4  
  Version Date: 09/19 /2019  study in patient with active Crohn’s disease also suggested benefit when administered on every 
two-week basis . 70 Tocilizumab is generally well tolerated in patients with rheumatoid arthritis; 
the most commonly reported side effects being dyslipidemia (21– 25%), increased liver 
transaminases (5– 6%) and transient decreases in neutrophil counts . 71-73 IL-6 blockade inhibits 
the acute phase response and may thereby mask signs of acute severe infections. Although 
some studies in rheumatoid arthritis have shown a higher rate of infections in patients treated 
with tocilizumab , 71,72 this could not be confirmed in a large multicenter study . 73  
 1.4.1 Tocilizumab and Treatment of GVHD  
Murine studies of GVHD have shown that treatment with an anti -IL-6R antibody is able to 
significantl y reduce GVHD -associated mortality and pathologic damage. 
58 In addition to a few 
case reports and abstracts, 2 two published case series report the effects of tocilizumab  in the 
treatment of steroid -refractory aGVHD . 74,75 
 
Drobyski et al. 75 published a series of eight  patients who received toci lizumab  for steroid-
refractory aGVHD. Responses were observed in four of six patients with severe aGVHD that 
had failed to respond to first, and in most cases, second- line therapies. Five patients had grade 
IV GVHD (four GI and one skin), while one patient  had grade II GI and one had grade III liver 
GVHD. One of these patients died early after tocilizumab  administration and was not evaluable, 
one patient did not respond, three patients were classified as partial responders, and two patients were considered complete responders. In one of the patients with partial response, tocilizumab  was discontinued for the possibility of causing worsening of preexisting 
hyperbilirubinemia. Infections were responsible for the major adverse events associated with 
tocilizumab , with a total of 13 documented infections. Roddy et al. 
74 reported the effect of 
tocilizumab  in patients with steroid- refractory aGVHD, including seven patients with grade IV 
and two with grade III. Two patients were classified as complete responders, and two patients  
had mixed response with persistence of severe aGVHD in one organ but resolution in other 
organs, and four patients did not respond. In this series, four  patients had infectious events with 
two deaths being reported, but no liver toxicity was observed.  1.4.2 Tocilizumab and GVHD prophylaxis  
A phase I/II study conducted by Kennedy et al. assessed if tocilizumab  could attenuate the 
incidence of acute GVHD 
76 when given as adjunct to the GVHD prophylactic regimen. Eligible 
patients were 18  to 65 years old and underwent T- replete HLA -matched alloHCT with either 
IIT-Chhabra- Proactive  24 Version No. 4  
  Version Date: 09/19 /2019  total body irradiation (TBI) -based myeloablative (MAC) or RIC using unrelated or sibling donors. 
One intravenous (IV) dose of tocilizumab  (8 mg/kg, capped at 800 mg, over 60 mins’ infusion) 
was given the day before alloHCT along with standard GVHD prophylaxis (cyclosporine [5 
mg/kg per day on Day s –1 to +1, then 3 mg/kg per day to maintain therapeutic levels (trough 
levels of 140–300 ng/mL) for 100 days plus methotrexate [15 mg/m²  on Day 1, then 10 mg/m² 
on Days 3, 6 and 11]). The primary endpoint was incidence of grade 2– 4 aGVHD at Day 100, 
assessed and graded , as per the Seattle criteria. Immunological profiles were compared with a 
non-randomized group of patients receiving alloHCT, but not treated with tocilizumab . A total of 
48 patients receiving CSP+MTX as GVHD prophylaxis were enrolled into the study. The incidence of grade II –IV aGVHD in patients treated with tocilizumab  at Day 100 was 12% (95CI 
5–24), and the incidence of grade III –IV aGVHD was 4% (1 –13). Grade II –IV aGVHD involving 
the skin developed in five (10%) patients of 48 treated with tocilizumab , involving GI tract in four 
(8%) patients; there were no reported cases involving the liver. Low incidences of grade II –IV 
aGVHD were noted in patients receiving both TBI -based MAC (12% [95% CI 2–34) and 
fludarabine and melphalan RIC (12% [4– 27]). There were  no reports of graft failure and immune 
reconstitution was preserved in tocilizumab  recipients, but with suppression of known 
pathogenic STAT3- dependent pathways. The addition of tocilizumab  appeared generally safe 
with no increase in graft rejections, time to neutrophil engraftment, chimerism posttransplant, or early relapse compared with historical controls. Only three patients experienced severe liver 
toxicity during the first month after transplantation. This study showed that inhibition of IL -6 
superim posed on the calcineurin inhibitor -based GVHD prophylaxis is a potential strategy to 
reduce the incidence of acute GVHD without compromising immune reconstitution . 
76 
 
A phase II study of tocilizumab  was conducted by Drobyski et al.  in alloHCT patients using 
matched related/unrelated donor and receiving Tac/MTX for GVHD prophylaxis . 77 Tocilizumab 
was administered IV as a single dose of 8 mg/kg the day before alloHCT. A total of 35 patients 
were enrolled in the study and all received busulfan- based conditioning (Flu/BU4, Flu/BU2 or 
BU/CY). The majority of patients (83%) received peripheral blood grafts. The primary endpoint 
is grade II –IV GVHD during the first 180 days posttransplant. The median follow -up of surviving 
patients was 12 months (range 5– 16). The incidence of grades II –IV and III –IV aGVHD at D ay 
100 was 14 % (95CI 5– 30%) and 3% (95CI 0 –11%), respectively. In the first 100 days post -
alloHCT, there were no cases of acute GVHD of lower GI tract and only one patient developed 
grade IV aGVHD of skin. Five patients died from relapse between 140  to 270 days 
posttransplant, while five patients died as a result of TRM (GVHD, n=2; infection, n=2; IPS 
IIT-Chhabra- Proactive  25 Version No. 4  
  Version Date: 09/19 /2019  (n=1). TRM was 9% (95CI 2– 20%) and relapse was 17% (95CI 7– 31%) at six months. In 
addition, we performed a matched (1:4) case- control analysis with contemporary controls  
(n=130)  from the Center for International Blood and Marrow  Transplant Research (CIBMTR) 
from 2000  to 2014 that were identified according to the same eligibility criteria for the trial except 
for the use of Tac/MTX as GVHD prophylaxis and were matched for age, Karnofsky 
Performance Score (KPS), disease and donor type. The incidence of grades II –IV aGVHD at 
Day +180 was significantly lower in the tocilizumab /Tac/MTX cohort when compared with  the 
CIBMTR Tac/MTX control population (17 % vs. 4 5%, P=0.001 ). Corresponding probabilities of 
grade II –IV aGVHD -free survival at six months, which was the primary objective of the study, 
were 69% and 4 2% (P=0.0 01 by stratified log rank test). There w ere no differences in relapse, 
TRM, DFS or OS at six  months between the two groups. These two prospective studies thus 
show that tocilizumab  has promising activity in preventing aGVHD, particularly lower GI tract 
GVHD and late onset aGVHD.  
 1.5 Success of allogeneic transplant: relapse versus non- relapse m ortality  
AlloHCT used for the treatment of hematologic malignancies is associated with two main risk 
factors for poor outcomes: transplantation- related mortality (also referred to as NRM) and 
mortality from disease relapse (relapse -related mortality). Effo rts to mitigate one cause of 
mortality have often compromised the other. For example, efforts to reduce GVHD risk by T- cell 
depletion of the allograft can lower transplantation -related morbidity/mortality, but can also 
increase relapse risk . 
78,79 Similarly, efforts at reducing relapse with intensified pre -transplant 
conditioning regimen can lead to increased mortality from organ dysfunction, infections, or GVHD. 
80 Therefore, clinical trials are needed that evaluate the post -transplant outcomes by 
focusing on both NRM and relapse risk concurrently, rather than having only one as the primary objective. In addition, both endpoints NRM and relapse mortality do not reflect non -lethal 
morbidity. Because of these concerns, a composite endpoint such as GRFS would be ideal to assess all significant and relevant endpoints in a study evaluating a new clinical strategy with the potential to impact outcomes after alloHCT. 
81 The events for GRFS include grade III -IV 
acute GVHD, systemic therapy -requiring chronic GVHD, relapse, or death in the first year post -
HCT. GRFS, therefore, represents ideal recovery from HCT (at one  year) and a measure of 
cure without ongoing morbidity.  
 
Using a cohort of 628 adult patients treated with tacrolimus and methotrexate as GVHD prophylaxis between 2006 and 2009, data from the Center for International Blood and Marrow 
IIT-Chhabra- Proactive  26 Version No. 4  
  Version Date: 09/19 /2019  Transplant Research determined that the 1 -year probability of GRFS was 23% (95% confidence 
interval [CI] 20- 26). 81 In other words, only approximately one -quarter of patients transplanted 
for hematologic malignancy survived without at least one of these major complications during 
the first 12 months after alloHCT.  
 
We earlier hypothesized and demonstrated that tocilizumab  could attenuate the incidence of 
aGVHD after MAC and RIC alloHCT , using matched sibling or unrelated donor . 77 In this study, 
we hypothesize that longer term IL- 6 inhibition through treatment with tocilizumab  by repeated 
dosing would mediate  a beneficial effect not only on the risk of aGVHD, but also on chronic 
GVHD. This will be achieved by administering an additional dose of tocilizumab  at Day +100 
post-alloHCT, besides the pretransplant dose, as done in our previous clinical trial, thereby  
providing total prophylaxis against both acute and chronic GVHD.  
 
1.6 Studies of the Microbiome in Transplant  Patients  
The microbiome, consisting of a varied community of microbes (bacteria, viruses, fungi, microeukaryotes, and sometimes multicellular parasites), exists in niches across the human 
body. The  skin, lung,  nares,  vagina,  and gastrointestinal tract are among  the most  heavily  
colonized,  with the largest number of microorganisms inhabiting the colonic lumen. While the 
majority  of the over trillion  organisms  that live within a healthy human colon are nonpathogenic 
members of the phyla Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, and Proteobacteria, alterations in the balance of these microorganisms have been associated with adverse outcomes ranging from GVHD and infection to relapse post -HCT. 
82 This clinical association between intestinal 
microorganisms and HCT outcomes has been investigated for decades – and has informed the 
still controversial practices of infection prophylaxis, gut decontamination, the “neutropenic diet,” 
and isolation of patients in laminar air flow rooms. Single- institution studies have demonstrated 
that low microbial diversity in the stool after allogeneic HCT is associated with poor survival . 83,84 
Additionally, specific alterations have been associated with increased risk of acute GVHD, 
infectious outcomes and most recently, relapse . 85-87 While these findings are compelling, the  
generalizability  of these  proposed microbial  biomarkers  is unclear.  This is particularly important 
as there is known geographic variation of the intestinal microbiome and practice variability  in 
antibiotic  use for prophylaxis  and treatment  from institution  to institution,  in part due to different  
antibiograms.  
IIT-Chhabra- Proactive  27 Version No. 4  
  Version Date: 09/19 /2019  Novel methods in microbiome research are likely to facilitate translational breakthroughs – these 
methods allow (1) detailed taxonomic classification of microorganisms at the strain level, (2) 
metabolic characterization of the small molecules and proteins that a microbial community makes, (3) measurement of microbial genomic evolution in clinical time courses, and (4) culturing of previously fastidious organisms from the microbiome for in vitro investigation and 
cultivation as potential therapeutic live bacterial clinical interventions. Given recent reports 
suggesting that alterations in the microbiome can impact the efficacy of immunologic therapies, it is imperative that the link between the microbiome and transplant  outcomes is 
investigated.
88,89  
1.6.1 Microbiome and Outcomes after Allogeneic Transplantation using Tocilizumab as 
GVHD prophylaxis  
The study will test the secondary hypothesis that the use of IL- 6 blockage (tocilizumab) which 
has been shown to lower gastrointestinal GVHD rates preserves the gut microbiome diversity 
(determined by 16s rRNA sequencing analysis of the sequential stool sample collected pre - and 
post-transplant until neutrophil engraftment). Additional analyses on patient samples will be 
conducted to answer the key question concerning the impact of the gut microbiome on transplant outcome. Aliquots preserved additionally will establish a cohort of stool samples collected prospectively for future sequencing by shotgun metagenomic sequencing and metabolomic analysis.  
2. HYPOTHESIS A ND OBJECTIVES 
We earlier hypothesized and demonstrated that tocilizumab  could attenuate the incidence of 
aGVHD after MAC and RIC alloHCT , using a matched sibling or an unrelated donor . 90 In this 
study, we hypothesize that longer term IL -6 inhibition through treatment with tocilizumab  by 
repeated dosing would mediate a beneficial effect not only on the risk of aGVHD, but also on chronic GVHD. This will be achieved by administering an additional dose of tocilizumab  at Day 
+100 post -alloHCT, besides the pretransplant dose, as done in our previous clinical trial, 
thereby providing total prophylaxis against both acute and chronic GVHD.  
The study will test the secondary hypothesis that the use of IL- 6 blockage (tocilizumab) which 
has been shown to lower gastrointestinal GVHD rates preserves the gut microbiome diversity (determined by 16s rRNA sequencing analysis of the sequential stool sample collected pre - and 
post-transplant until neutrophil engraftment). Additional analyses on patient samples will be 
conducted to answer the key question concerning the impact of the gut microbiome on 
IIT-Chhabra- Proactive  28 Version No. 4  
  Version Date: 09/19 /2019  transplant outcome. Aliquots preserved additionally will establish a cohort of stool samples 
collected prospectively for future sequencing by shotgun metagenomic sequencing and metabolomic analysis.

  Version Date: 09/19 /2019  3 STUDY DESIGN  
 
3.1 General  Description 
This is a phase II, open -label, single- arm trial designed to evaluate the efficacy of tocilizumab  in 
improving the GVHD and relapse- free survival.  
 
3.1.1 Number  of Subjects  
Thirty -two (32) patients.  
 
3.2 Primary Endpoint(s)  
The primary endpoint of this trial is GRFS. An event for this outcome is defined as grade III –IV 
acute GVHD, systemic therapy requiring chronic GVHD, relapse or death. Patients who are 
alive without GVHD will be censored at the last follow- up.  
 
3.3 S econdary  Endpoint(s)  
3.3.1 Acute GVHD  
Cumulative incidences of grades II –IV and III –IV acute GVHD will be determined at Day  +100 
and Day +180 post -HCT. Acute GVHD will be graded according to Appendix  1. The time of 
onset of grade II –IV acute GVHD and time to development of the highest grade until Day +180 
will be recorded. Development of acute GVHD will be considered an event for this endpoint. Death but not disease relapse will be considered a competing even t. 
 3.3.2 Chronic  GVHD 
The cumulative incidence of chronic GVHD by NIH Consensus criteria will be determined. Development of chronic GVHD or death will be considered events for this endpoint. The highest grade of chronic GVHD will be recorded. In addition,  the time of onset of chronic GVHD and the 
time to highest chronic GVHD grade will be recorded. Death but not disease relapse will be considered a competing event.  
 3.3.3 Hematopoietic  Recovery 
Hematopoietic recovery will be assessed according to neutrophil and platelet counts recovery after HCT. Neutrophil recovery or engraftment is defined as achieving an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥500/mm
3 for three consecutive measurements on three different days. The first of 
the three days will be designated the day of neutrophil engraftment. The competing event is 
IIT-Chhabra- Proactive  30 Version No. 4  
  Version Date: 09/19 /2019  death without engraftment. Platelet recovery is defined by either the first day of a sustained 
platelet count >20,000/mm3 for three  days with no platelet transfusion in the preceding seven 
days . The fir st day of sustained platelet count above these thresholds will be designated the day 
of platelet engraftment.  
 
3.3.4 Graft  Failure 
Graft failure will be assessed as a secondary endpoint, including primary and secondary graft 
failure. Primary graft failure is defined as no neutrophil recovery to > 500 cells/μL by Day 28 
post-HCT. Secondary graft failure will be assessed according to neutrophil count after initial 
hematologic recovery. Secondary graft failure is defined as initial neutrophil engraftment followed by subsequent decline in absolute neutrophil counts <500 cells/μL, unresponsive to 
growth factor therapy, but cannot be explained by disease relapse or drugs.  
 3.3.5 Nonrelapse Mortality (NRM)  
NRM is defined as death after alloHCT without relapse. The cumulative incidence of NRM will be estimated at Day  +100 and one  year after alloHCT. An event for this endpoint is death 
without evidence of disease progression or relapse. Disease progression or relapse will be considered a competing event.  
 3.3.6  Disease  Relapse or Progression  
Relapse is defined by either morphological, cytogenetic or radiologic evidence of the pretransplant hematologic malignancy. Institution of any therapy to treat persistent, progressive or relapsed disease, including the withdrawal of immunosuppressive therapy or donor 
lymphocyte infusion, will be considered evidence of relapse/progression. NRM will be 
considered a competing event.  
 3.3.7  Progression- Free Survival  
The event for this endpoint is relapse/progression or death. The time to this event is measured 
from transplant to death or relapse/progression, whichever comes first. Patients who are alive and disease- free will be censored at last follow -up. 
 3.3.8 Overall  Survival   
The event for this endpoint is death from any cause. The time to this event is measured from the 
time of transplant to death from any cause or for surviving patients, to last follow -up. Survivors 
IIT-Chhabra- Proactive  31 Version No. 4  
  Version Date: 09/19 /2019  will be censored at last follow -up. 
 
3.3.9   Incidence of Infections  
The incidence of grade≥3 (CTCAE v 5) viral, fungal and bacterial infections until day+180 will be 
determined. The cumulative incidence of CMV viremia post -alloHCT will be described.  
 3.3.10  Donor  Cell Chimerism  
Chimerism will be evaluated using sorted whole blood in CD3+ and CD33+ fractions. Mixed chimerism is defined as the presence of donor cells, as a proportion of total cells to be >5% and <95%. Full donor chimerism is defined as ≥95% of donor cells. Donor cells of ≤5% will be considered as graft rejection. Donor cell chimerism will be assessed for all patients at Day  +28 , 
and Day +100 for both CD3+ and CD33+ fractions. The proportion of patients with each level of 
chimerism listed above will be described. CD3+ donor cell chimerism will be used to define the donor/recipient chimerism status.  
 3.3.11  Immune Reconstitution  
Quantitative assessments of peripheral blood CD3, CD4, CD8, CD19 and CD56 positive lymphocytes will be done through flow cytometric analysis at Day s +28, + 100, +180, and +365. 
 3.3.12 Patient -Reported  Quality of L ife (PR-QoL)  Endpoints  
The QoL endpoints of this study are depressive symptoms, anxiety, fatigue, sleep, and pain at baseline, Day +28, Day +100, Day +180, and D ay +365 post -transplant.  
• Depression:  This will be addressed through the General Depression subscale of the 
IDAS and includes 20 questions with a scoring range of 20- 100 (mean in community 
dwelling adult of 44.99 and standard deviation of 14.75).18 
• Anxiety:  Anxiety will be assessed using two subscale items of the IDAS including panic 
(health population mean = 12.58, SD = 5.26) and traumatic intrusions (healthy population mean = 7.60, SD = 4.20).
18  
• Fatigue:  The FSI will be utilized to assess fatigue; a score of 3 or greater on items 
assessing fatigue in the past week (average of items 1 -3; FSI Composite) indicates 
clinically mea ningful fatigue.19, 20 The FSI can also be evaluated using the average rating 
of the degree to which fatigue interfered with some general activities (0- 10; FSI 
Interference); participants’ ratings of the number of days in the past week they felt fatigued ( 0-7; FSI Days); and participants’ rating of what percent of each day in the past 
IIT-Chhabra- Proactive  32 Version No. 4  
  Version Date: 09/19 /2019  week, on average, they felt fatigued (0 -100; FSI Percent).20 Individuals scoring at or 
above the cutoff also report significantly greater scores on these other subscales.  
• Sleep: Sleep will be assessed using the PSQI, with a score of >5 considered disturbed 
sleep as adjusted for cancer populations.21, 22 
• Pain:  The BPI assesses pain intensity as well as pain- related interference in function.23, 
24 BPI Pain Severity score ranges from 0- 40 (first four items), and the BPI Pain 
Interference score is a mean of the last 7 items (5a- 5g) with a range of 0- 10. 
3.3.13  Microbiome  
The gut microbiome taxonomic diversity will be evaluated using 16S ribosomal RNA amplicon 
sequencing. Data will be generated per standard protocols  91. Resultant sequencing data will be 
quality  filtered,  adapter  sequences  will be trimmed, and sequences  will be analyzed using the 
QIIME pipeline 92. Shannon diversity will be calculated 93. 
 
Guidelines for reporting of Depression and/or Suicidal Ideation:  
Should the patient endorse any thoughts of suicidality or self harm per the IDAS, the study co-
investigator for this portion of the ancillary testing (Dr. Jennifer Knight) will contact them by phone and standard of care referrals will be made. Should completion of the study surveys 
prompt participants to want treatment for any of the other symptoms, participants will be offered 
a referral for appropriate care through the Quality of Life Center at the Froedtert Cancer Center.  
 
3.4 Prima ry Completion  
The study will reach primary completion 18  months from the t ime the study opens to accrual.  
 
3.5 Study  Completion  
The study will reach study completion 30 m onths from the time the study opens to accrual.

5.3.2 GVHD  Assessment  
Patients will be monitored for development of acute and chronic GVHD , per standard operating 
procedures at the MCW BMT Program, but at minimum on Day s +28 (+/ -7), +56 (+/ -7), +100 
(+/-14), +180 (+ /-14), +365 (+/ -28) post -HCT. Diagnosis of acute GVHD may not necessitate 
biopsy confirmation in at least one involved organ, but would be preferred. When more than one organ is involved, biopsy confirmation of all involved organs is recommended but not necessary. 
IIT-Chhabra- Proactive  38 Version No. 4  
  Version Date: 09/19 /2019  With liver -only GVHD, biopsy confirmation is strongly recommended. Acute GVHD will be 
assessed by consensus criteria (Appendix 2) 95 and chronic GVHD diagnosis and grading will 
be according to NIH Criteria 96,97. Please see Appendix 2.  
Independent GVHD adjudication is mandated in the study. Acute and chronic GVHD will be 
adjudicated by an independent Faculty Research Committee (FRC) -appointed review panel. 
Protocol PIs will be blinded to the adjudication panel and will not be permitted to gr ade or modify 
GVHD assessments. GVHD case report forms (CRFs) will be completed by treating MDs/NPs/APPs in real time , as indicated in study calendar. FRC adjudication panel will grade 
GVHD, using a calendar -driven approach ( Days +100 and +180 for aGVHD and Days +180 and 
+365 for chronic GvHD).  
 5.3.3 Clinical Grading of Chronic GVHD (Appendix)  
 
• None. 
• Mild chronic GVHD involves only one or two  organs or sites (except the lung: see 
below ), with no clinically significant functional impairment (maximum of score 1 in all 
affected organs or sites) . 
• Moderate chronic GVHD involves: (1) at least one  organ or site with clinically significant 
but no major disability (maximum score of 2 in any affected organ or site) or (2) three or 
more organs or sites with no clinically significant functional impairment (maximum score of 1 in all affected organs or sites). A lung score of 1 will also be considered moderate chronic GVHD.  
• Severe chronic GVHD indicates major disability caused by chronic GVHD (score of 3 in any organ or site). A lung score of 2 or greater will also be considered severe chronic GVHD.  
• Presence of limited or extensive chronic GVHD will be also be recorded.  
 
5.4 Study  Withdraw al Proc edures  
5.4.1 Duration of Therapy  
In the absence of treatment delays due to adverse events, treatment may continue for or until:  
 Disease progression. 
 General or specific changes in the patient’s condition render the patient unacceptable for 
further treatment in the inv estigator’s judgment.

6  TREATMENT PLAN 
6.1 Conditioning Regimens  
Eligible patients will receive myeloablative conditioning at the discretion of the treating 
physician.  
It is recommended that adjusted ideal body weight be used when calculating conditioning 
regimen chemotherapy doses. One exception is fludarabine, which uses actual body weight.  
Ideal Body Weight (IBW) Formulas:  
Males IBW = 50 kg + 2.3 kg/inch over 5 feet . 
Females IBW = 45.5 kg +  2.3 kg/inch over 5 feet . 
Adjusted Ideal Body Weight Formula:  
AIBW = IBW + [(0.40) x (ABW - IBW)]  
IIT-Chhabra- Proactive  40 Version No. 4  
  Version Date: 09/19 /2019  6.2  Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation  
Bone marrow or mobilized peripheral blood graft will be the graft source in this study.  
6.2.1  Peripheral Blood Progenitor Cells (PBPC) Mobilization and Collection  
PBPC mobilization and collection will be done according to standard operating procedures from 
MCW BMT program .  
Target CD34 cell doses are between 5– 10 x 106 per kg recipient body weight .  
The transportation of the PBPC product from unrelated donors shall be done in accordance with NMDP standards.  
6.2.2 PBPC  Infusion  
PBPC grafts will be infused according to standard operating procedures from MCW BMT program at Day 0. For recipients of related donor PBPC, whose donors require a third day of 
collection ( Day +1), these cells will be infused separately from the D ay –1 and Day 0 collections 
on Day +1.  
 6.3 Tacrolimus /Methotrexate/Tocilizumab  
6.3.1 Tacrolimus  
Tacrolimus will be given per standard operating procedures from the MCW BMT program, The 
dose should be adjusted accordingly to maintain a suggested level of 5– 10 ng/mL. The dose of 
tacrolimu s may be switched to oral at a 1:3 dose equivalence and rounded to the nearest 0.5 
mg at the discretion of the treating physician. If patients are on medications which alter the metabolism of tacrolimus (e.g. , azoles), the initial starting dose and subsequent doses should 
be altered , as per institutional practices. Tacrolimus taper can be initiated at a minimum of 90 
days post -HSCT , if there is no evidence of active GVHD. The rate of tapering will be done 
according institutional practices,  but patients should be off tacrolimus by Day 180 post -HSCT , if 
there is no evidence of active GVHD.  
 6.3.2 Methotrexate  
Methotrexate will be administered, per institutional practices .. Dose reduction of MTX due to 
worsening creatinine clearance after initiation of conditioning regimen, high serum levels or development of oral mucositis is allowed, according to institutional practices.  
IIT-Chhabra- Proactive  41 Version No. 4  
  Version Date: 09/19 /2019   
6.3.3 Tocilizumab  
Tocilizumab will be administered intravenously (IV) at a dose of 8 mg/kg (maximum dose of 800 
mg) once on the D ay -1 approximately 24 hours prior to the estimated time of the hematopoietic 
cell infusion , and subsequently , on Day +100 (+/ - 14 days, i.e., Days +86 to +114)  post-alloHCT.  
The weight used to calculate the dose will be within 7 days of first dose of tocili zumab. Only if 
the weight has changed >10% (over the baseline weight), then the dosage of tocilizumab (for the second dose) will be changed depending on the weight checked within 14 days prior to the second dose.  The infusion will be administered over 60 minutes through a dedicated IV line and 
must not be administered by IV bolus . Commercially available tocilizumab will be utilized for the 
study.  
 6.3.3.1 Contraindications to Tocilizumab dosing on Day s +100 (range, Day +86 to +114) : 
1) Grade 4 (according to CTCAE version 5 hematologic or nonhematologic events (which have 
life-threatening consequences and require urgent treatment). Dosing will be allowed upon 
recovery to grade ≤3. Transfusion to increase platelet and hemoglobin is allowed. Grade 3 febrile neutropenia and grade 3 increased AST/ALT/bilirubin are also contraindications to dosing of tocilizumab ; recovery to grade 2 or lower would allow for tocilizumab  dosing within 
the time frame of D ay +86 through Day +114. 
2) Disease (relapse or progression of the primary malignancy) for which treatment is indicated.  
3) Donor leukocyte infusion (DLI) prior to planned second dose of tocilizumab  for any 
indication: infection, disease control or to address mixed chimerism .

IIT-Chhabra- Proactive  42 Version No. 4  
  Version Date: 09/19 /2019   
6.4.2  Prophylaxis against Infections  
Patients will receive infection prophylaxis according to standard operating procedures of the MCW BMT program.  
 
6.5 Participant  Risks  
See section 7.2, known AEs.  
 
6.6. Quality of Life  (QoL)  Assessments  
6.6.1. Instruments  
Participants will complete a battery of self -report surveys at the following time points: baseline, 
Day +28, Day +100, Day +180 and Day + 365 post-transplant  (total of 5 time points). The self -
repor t surveys to be completed include: Inventory of Depression and Anxiety Symptoms (IDAS; 
depression and anxiety), Fatigue Symptom Inventory (FSI; fatigue), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality 
Index (PSQI; sleep), and Brief Pain Inventory (BPI; pain).  QoL measures will be administered to 
English -speaking patients. All QoL assessments will be completed by patients on a single day, 
during the routine clinic visit associated with the corresponding study time point. QoL at each 
time point will be summarized  using simple descriptive statistics (mean, SD). Change in patient -
reported outcomes from enrollment to Day 100, 6 and 12 months will be calculated. The primary objective is to compare alteration in Q oL symptoms between this cohort receiving two doses of 
tocilizumab and the prior tocilizumab cohort receiving only one dose of tocilizumab. PR -QoL 
outcomes among survivors at each time point will be compared in an initial analysis using two sample t -statistics. The missing data pattern of the QoL measurements will be examined using 
graphical techniques and logistic regression models conditional on survival.  
Should patients endorse any thoughts of suicidality or self -harm per the IDAS, study Co- I and 
Psycho- Oncology Medical Director, Dr. Jennifer Knight, will contact them by phone.  Should 
completion of the study surveys prompt participants to want treatment for any of the other symptoms, participants will be offered a referral for appropriate care through the Quality of Life Center at the Froedtert Hospital Cancer Center.  
7  ADVERSE EVENTS: DEFINITIONS  AND REPORTING 
REQUIREMENTS 
7.1 Definitions  
IIT-Chhabra- Proactive  43 Version No. 4  
  Version Date: 09/19 /2019  7.1.1 Adverse Event (AE) and Serious Adverse Events (SAE)  
An AE is defined as any abnormal laboratory value(s) or test result(s), even when they do not 
induce clinical signs or symptoms or require therapy’, as per 21 CFR 312.32(a). The investigator 
and his or her team will follow the Medical College of Wisconsin policies related to adverse event reporting. This information may be found on the 
Human Research Protection Program 
website .  
 Serious AE (SAE) means any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
• Death.  Results in death.  
• Life threatening . Is life threatening (refers to an AE in which the patient was at risk of 
death at the time of the event . It does not refer to an event which hypothetic ally might 
have caused death if it were more severe).  
• Hospitalization . Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of an existing 
hospitalization. 
• Disability/incapacity. Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity. 
(Disability is d efined as a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal 
life functions).  
• Medically important event . This refers to an AE that may not result in death, be 
immediately life threatening, or require hospitalization, but may be considered ser ious 
when, based on appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the patient, require 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above, or involves 
suspected transmission via a medicinal product of an infectious agent . Examples of such 
medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse; any organism, virus, or infectious particle (e.g., prion protein transmitting Transmissible 
Spongiform Encephalopathy), pathogenic or nonpathogenic, is considered an infectious agent .  
Clarification should be made between a serious AE (SAE) and an AE that is considered severe in intensity (Grade 3 or 4), because the terms serious and severe are NOT synonymous . The 
general term severe is often used to describe the intensity (severity) of a specific event; the event itself, however, may be of relatively minor medic al significance (such as a Grade 3 
headache) . This is NOT the same as serious, which is based on patient/event outcome or action 
IIT-Chhabra- Proactive  44 Version No. 4  
  Version Date: 09/19 /2019  criteria described above and is usually associated with events that pose a threat to a patient’s 
life or ability to function. A severe AE (Grade 3 or 4) does not necessarily need to be considered 
serious . For example, a white blood cell count of 1000/mm3 to less than 2000 is considered 
Grade 3 (severe) but may not be considered serious . Seriousness (not intensity) serves as a 
guide for defining regulatory reporting obligations . 
 
7.1.2 Unanticipated Problem Involving Risk to Subject or Other (UPIRSO)  
The investigator and his or her team will follow the Medical College of Wisconsin policies related to unanticipated problems involving risks to subjects or others. This information may be found 
on the Human Research Protection Program website
.  
 
 
7.1.3 AE  Attribution and Grading  
Adver se Event Grading  
Grade  Description  
0 No AE (or within normal limits).  
1 Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic 
observations only; intervention not indicated.  
2 Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention (e.g., 
packing cautery) indicated; limiting age -appropriate 
instrumental activities of daily living (ADL).  
3 Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -
threatening; hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization 
indicated; disabling; limiting s elf-care ADL.  
4 Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated.  
5 Death related to AE  
 
 Adverse Event Attribution 
Attribution is an assessment of the relationship between the AE and the medical intervention.  
 
IIT-Chhabra- Proactive  45 Version No. 4  
  Version Date: 09/19 /2019  Relationship  Attribution  Description  
Unrelated to investigational 
agent/intervention  Unrelated  The AE is clearly NOT  related  to the 
intervention  
Unlikely  The AE is doubtfully related  to the 
intervention  
Related to investigational 
agent/intervention  Possible  The AE may be related  to the 
intervention  
Probable  The AE is likely related  to the 
intervention  
Definite  The AE is clearly related  to the 
intervention  
 
Relationship Assessment:  In- Depth Definitions 
For all collected AEs, the clinician who examines and evaluates the subject will determine the 
adverse event’s causality based on temporal relationship and his/her clinical judgment. The degree of certainty about causality will be graded using the categories below : 
Definitely Related: There is clear evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and other possible 
contributing factors can be ruled out. The clinical event, including an abnormal laboratory test result, occurs in a plausible time relationship to drug administration and cannot be explained by concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals. The response to withdrawal of the drug (dechallenge) should be clinically plausible. The event must be pharmacologically or 
phenomenologically definitive, with use of  a satisfactory rechallenge procedure if necessary.  
Probably Related : There is evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and the influence of 
other factors is unlikely. The clinical event, including an abnormal laboratory test result, occurs 
within a reasonable time sequence to administration of the drug, is unlikely to be attributed to concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals, and follows a clinically reasonable response on withdrawal (dechallenge). Rechallenge information is not required to fulfill this definition.  
Possibly Related : There is some evidence to suggest a causal relationship (e.g., the event 
occurred within a reasonable time after administration of the trial medication). However, the influence of other factors may have contributed to the event (e.g., the subject’s clinical condition, 
other concomitant events). Although an adverse drug event may rate only as “possibly related” 
soon after discovery, it can be flagged as requiring more information and later be upgraded to “probably related” or “definitely related”, as appropriate.  
Unlikely : A clinical event, including an abnormal laboratory test result, whose temporal 
relationship to drug administration makes a causal relationship improbable (e.g., the event did not occur within a reasonable time after administration of the trial medication) and in which other 
IIT-Chhabra- Proactive  46 Version No. 4  
  Version Date: 09/19 /2019  drugs or chemicals or underlying disease provides plausible explanations (e.g., the subject’s 
clinical condition, other concomitant treatments).  
Unrelated : The AE is completely independent of study drug administration, and/or evidence 
exists that the event is definitely related to another etiology. There must be an alternative, definitive etiology documented by the clinician.

the annual renewal of the protocol .   
 7.4 Monitoring and Recording an Adverse Event   
Definition . Any clinically relevant deterioration in laboratory assessments or other clinical 
finding is considered an AE .  
Reporting source . AEs may  be spontaneously reported by the patient and/or in response to an 
open question from study personnel or revealed by observation, physical examination or other diagnostic procedures .  
Prior to the trial . Planned hospital admissions or surgical procedures for an illness or disease 
that existed before the patient was enrolled in the trial are not to be considered AEs unless the 
condition deteriorated in an unexpected manner during the trial (e.g., surgery was performed 
earlier or later than planned) .  
Pretreatment events following signed informed consent.  For serious pretreatment events, 
the investigator must determine both the intensity of the event and the relationship of the event to study procedures.  Treatment events.  For serious AEs, the investigator must determine both the intensity of the 
event and the relationship of the event to study drug administration.  
Not serious AEs . For non- serious AEs, the investigator must determine both the intensity of the 
event and the relationship of the event to study drug administration.  
Follow -up of Adverse Events  
IIT-Chhabra- Proactive  48 Version No. 4  
  Version Date: 09/19 /2019  All adverse events will be followed with appropriate medical management until Day+180 or until 
they are resolved, if they are related to the study treatment. 
 7.4.1 Procedure  for Reporting Drug Exposure  during Pregnancy and Birth Events  
If a woman becomes pregnant, or suspects that she is pregnant, while participating in this study, she must inform the investigator immediately and permanently discontinue the study drug. The sponsor -investigator must noti fy the DSMC by email. The pregnancy must be followed for the 
final pregnancy outcome.  
If a female partner of a male patient becomes pregnant during the male patient’s participation in this study, the sponsor -investigator must also immediately notify the DS MC by email. Every 
effort should be made to follow the pregnancy for the final pregnancy outcome.  
 7.4.2 Subject  Complaints  
If a complaint is received by anyone on the study staff, it will be discussed with the study staff and will be addressed on a case -by-case basis. The PI will b e notified of any complaints. 
Complaints will be reported to the IRB if indicated .  
If the s ubject has questions about his or her  rights as a study subject, wants to report any 
problems or complaints, obt ain information about the study  or offer input , the subject can call 
the Medical College of Wisconsin/Froedtert Hospital research subject advocate at 414 -955-
8844. This information is provided to the subject in their consent .  
A product complaint is a verbal, written or electronic  expression that implies dissatisfaction 
regarding the identity, strength, purity, quality or stability of a drug product .  Study staff, who 
identify a potential product complaint situation should immediately contact the sponsor and report the event. Whenever possible, the associated product should be maintained in accordance with the label instructions pending further guidance from a sponsor representative. Product complaints in and of themselves are not Reportable Events . If a product complaint 
results in  an SAE, an SAE form should be completed.  
 
7.4.3 Routine  Reporting Procedures for AEs  
Expedited Reporting Procedures for SAEs , SARs,  UPIRSO s and DLTs . 
 
IIT-Chhabra- Proactive  49 Version No. 4  
  Version Date: 09/19 /2019  Since this is an investigator -initiated study, the principal investigator, also referred to as the 
sponsor -investigator, is responsible for reporting serious adverse events (SAEs) to any 
regulatory agency and to the sponsor- investigator’s IRB.  
 
Signs or symptoms reported as adverse events will be graded and recorded by the i nvestigator, 
according to the CTCAE. When possible, signs and symptoms indicating a common underlying pathology should be noted as one comprehensive event .  
 The investigator will assess all adverse events and determine reporting requirements to the Medical College of Wisconsin Cancer Center ( MCWCC) DSMC and MCW IRB . 
 
Only grade 1 and 2 adverse events  related to the study drug and all grade 3,  4 and 5 adverse 
events  regardless of attribution  will be entered into OnCore®. 
 Reporting to the Data and Safety Monitoring Committee  (DSMC)  
Regardless of the causality, all unexpected grade 3, and all grade 4, and 5 SAEs , as well as any 
others requiring expedited reporting as defined in this protocol must be reported to the MCWCC 
DSMC within five  calendar days of study staff’s knowledge.  
Report Method:  The investigator will use email to report SAEs  and applicable AE  to the DSMC. 
The SAE report must include event term(s), serious criteria, and the sponsor -investigator’s or 
sub-investigator’s determination of both the intensity of the event(s) and the relationship of the 
event(s) to study drug administration. Intensity for each SAE, including any lab abnormalities, 
will be d etermined by using the NCI CTCAE  v5 as a guideline whenever possible.  
The criteria are available online at http://ctep.cancer.gov/reporting/ctc.html . 
 
Reporting to  MCW Institutional Review Board  (IRB)  
The principal investigator must report events  to the MCW IRB within five business days of his 
awareness of the event.

IIT-Chhabra- Proactive  51 Version No. 4  
  Version Date: 09/19 /2019  8  PHARMACEUTICAL INFORMATION 
8.1  Actemra® (Tocilizumab ) 
8.1.1  Product Description 
Single -use vials containing tocilizumab , preservative free, sterile concentrate solutions (20 mg/ml) for IV 
infusion are available in the following sizes:  80 mg, 200  mg and 400 mg.  The solution is colorless to pale 
yellow with a pH of approximately 6.5.   
Classification:   Immunomodulatory . 
Tocilizumab is a recombinant humanized interleukin- 6 receptor inhibiting monoclonal antibody. Tocilizumab  
binds to both soluble and membrane bound IL -6 receptors and results in the blockade of interleukin- 6 
signaling through these receptors.  
Pharmacokinetics :   
Pharmacokinetic studies indicate that tocilizumab  undergoes biphasic elimination from the circulation. In 
rheumatoid arthritis patients treated with 4 and 8 mg/kg every four weeks, the central volume of distribution was 
3.5 L and the peripheral volume of distribution was 2.9 L with a volume of distribution at steady state of 6.4 L . 
Tocilizumab dosed at 8 mg/kg resulted in a mean steady state area under the curve (AUC), minimum 
concentration (Cmin) and a maximum concentration (Cmax) of 35 + 15 mg∙hr/ml, 9.74 + 10.5 mcg/ml and 183 
+ 85.6 mcg/ml respectively . Tocilizumab  AUC, Cmin and Cmax increased with increasing body weight with an  
86% higher exposure in patients greater than 100 kg. As a result, doses exceeding 800 mg (max dosing weight 
100 kg) per infusion are not recommended.  
 
The total clearance of tocilizumab  is concentration dependent and is represented by the both the linear 
clearance and the nonlinear clearance . Upon saturation of the nonlinear clearance pathway, the main 
determining factor is linear clearance. The reported linear clearance in the pharmacokinetic studies  is estimated 
to be 12.5 mL/h. The concentration dependent half -life is up to 11 days for the 4 mg/kg dose and up to 13 days 
for the 8 mg/kg dose every four weeks at steady state.  
 
Special populations. Pharmacokinetic analysis in adult rheumatoid arthritis patients did not demonstrate a 
change in kinetics based  on age, gender or race. The effects of renal and hepatic impairment have not been 
assessed.  
 Contraindications:  
Side Effects:   Complete and updated adverse event information is available in the Investigational Drug 
Brochure and/or product package insert.  
Tocilizumab side effects include:  
 
 
IIT-Chhabra- Proactive  52 Version No. 4  
  Version Date: 09/19 /2019  • Hypersensitivity reactions  
• Respiratory: upper respiratory tract infections, nasopharyngitis, bronchitis  
• Gastrointestinal: mouth ulceration, upper abdominal pain, gastritis, gastrointestinal perforations  
• Hepatic: transaminases elevation 
• Neurologic: headache, dizziness  
• Cardiovascular: hypertension 
• Dermatologic: skin rash  
• Serious infections (See Section 8.1.5)  
 
8.1.2  Solution Preparation  
Using aseptic technique, utilize a 100 -ml bag of 0.9% sodium chloride injection USP and withdraw a volume 
equal to the volume of the tocilizumab  solution required for the dose. Next, withdraw the calculated volume of 
tocilizumab  solution necessary for the dose from the vials and slowly inject t he tocilizumab  to the infusion bag. 
The final solution volume should be 100ml . Gently invert the IV bag to mix the solution. Inspect the prepared 
IV solution for particulates.  
 
8.1.3  Route of  Administration  
The infusion will be administered over 60 minutes through a dedicated IV line and must not be administered by IV bolus.  
8.1.4  Storage Requirements  
Vials should be stored under refrigeration at 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F) . Do not freeze. Protect the vials from 
light by storage in the original package unt il time of use . Inspect vials visually for particulates and discoloration 
prior to use and discard if particulates or discoloration is noted.  Do not use beyond the expiration date on the 
container, package or prefilled syringe. Storage of prepared IV solution:  The solution may be stored under refrigeration or at room temperature for up to 24 hours and should be protected from light. 
 
8.1.5 Warnings  and Precautions  
Serious Infections . The product information labeling contains a black box warning regarding t he risk of 
serious infection. Most patients who developed these infections were taking concomitant immunosuppressants , such as methotrexate or corticosteroids . Serious infections leading to hospitalization or 
 
 
IIT-Chhabra- Proactive  53 Version No. 4  
  Version Date: 09/19 /2019  death, including tuberculosis, bacterial, invasive fungal, viral and other opportunistic infections have occurred 
in patients receiving tocilizumab . Viral reactivation and cases of herpes zoster exacerbation were reported in 
clinical trials . If a serious infection develops, tocilizumab  should be withheld until the infection is controlled.  
Gastrointestinal P erforations . Events of GI perforation have been reported in clinical trials, primarily as 
complications of diverticulitis . Patients presenting with new onset abdominal symptoms should be evaluated 
promptly.  
Laboratory Parameters . Neutropenia, decreases in platelets, transaminase elevations and increases in lipid 
parameters (total cholesterol, LDL and triglycerides) have been reported in relation to the use of tocilizumab . 
Drug Interact ions. Elevated levels of IL- 6 and other cytokines have been associated with reduced expression 
of some cytochrome (CYP) P450 enzymes . Tocilizumab, through IL -6 inhibition, has the potential to affect 
expression of multiple CYP enzymes by restoring their activity to a higher level than that in the absence of tocilizumab . Monitoring of drugs that are metabolized by CYPs with narrow therapeutic index or where the 
dose is individually adjusted is advised. Caution should be exercised when tocilizumab  is coadministered with 
CYP3A4 substrate drugs where decrease in effectiveness is undesirable, e.g., oral contraceptives, 
atorvastatin etc . The effect of tocilizumab  on CYP450 enzymes may occur within approximately two weeks of 
starting therapy and persist for several  weeks after stopping therapy.  
 
8.1.6 Availability  
This drug is commercially available, but will be paid for by the study .  
 
8.1.7 Investigator and Site Responsibility for Drug Accountability.  
Accountability for the study drug is the responsibilit y of the principal investigator/designee. The investigator will 
ensure that the drug is used only in accordance with this protocol. Drug accountability records indicating the 
drug’s delivery date to the site, inventory at the site, use by each patient, and disposal of the drug (if applicable) 
will be maintained by the clinical site. Accountability records will include dates, quantities, lot numbers, expiration dates (if applicable), and patient numbers. 
9 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
9.0 Study Populations  
The Full analysis set (FAS) will consist of all eligible patients enrolled in the study. This population will be used 
for the efficacy analyses.  
The Safety set (SS) will consist of all eligible patients enrolled in the study who received at least one dose of 
the study medication.  
 
 
IIT-Chhabra- Proactive  54 Version No. 4  
  Version Date: 09/19 /2019  9.1 Study  Endpoints  
Analysis of Primary Endpoint  
The primary analysis will be performed on the FAS population using the intention- to-treat principle including all 
patients enrolled in the trial. The GRFS will be estimated, using the Kaplan -Meier estimator and plotted with a 
95% confidence band . An event for this outcome is defined as grade III –IV acute GVHD, chronic GVHD 
requiring systemic therapy, relapse or death. Patients who are alive without GVHD will be censored at the last 
follow- up. The 12- month GRFS will be compared to the prespecified historical control value of 20% , using a 
one-sided z -test. 
 
Analysis of Secondary Endpoints  
Demographic and other baseline data, such as disease characteristics, as well as outcome measures , will be 
presented overall and separately for URD and MRD patients. Categorical data, such as gender, race, etc., will be presented by frequencies and percentages. Descriptive summary statistics (e.g. , frequency, mean, 
median, range and standard deviation) will be used to present numeric data.  
Time -to-event outcomes with and without competing risks will be analyzed, using Kaplan- Meier and Nelson-
Aalen estimates, respectively, and presented with 95% confidence intervals. Binary outcomes will be analyzed, using proportions with 95% confidence intervals. 
Effect of GVHD prophylaxis on microbiome diversity: Difference in the level of microbiome diversity detected at pre - and post -transplant . Microbiome diversity will be compared at each time point using Mann- Whitney 
tests. Association of pre-transplant  microbiome diversity with development of aGVHD, cGVHD, and overall 
survival (corrected for GVHD  prophylaxis): This analysis will use the pre -transplant  stool microbiome cohort; 
diversity will be grouped by tertiles or if a more appropriate classification is identified in the analysis, that may be used instead. Acute GVHD (grade 2 -4 or 3 -4) and chronic GVHD (any or moderate- severe) will be described 
in each group using cumulative incidence with death or relapse as a competing event, and compared between groups using Gray’s test. Overall survival will be described using the Kapl an-Meier estimator and compared 
between groups using the log- rank test. Multivariate models will be constructed in a similar manner as for the 
primary endpoint using Fine and Gray models for aGVHD and cGVHD, and using Cox models for OS.  
 Missing data  
Patients who are lost to follow -up will be censored at the day of the last contact with known status as 
appropriate for each outcome (for example, last day known alive for overall survival, and last day known alive without relapse or GVHD for GRFS).  
 
 
 
 
IIT-Chhabra- Proactive  55 Version No. 4  
  Version Date: 09/19 /2019  9.2 Study  Design  
The study is designed as a phase II, open- label, single- center trial to evaluate a novel GVHD prophylaxis 
regimen, Tac/MTX/ tocilizumab . The primary endpoint of the study is GRFS, GVHD/ relapse- free surviva l at 12 
months posttransplant.  
 
9.3 Accrual  Rate 
It is estimated that 18 months of accrual will be adequate to enroll the targeted sample size.  
9.4 Sample  Size Justification  
The sample size was selected to achieve 80% power to detect an increase in GRFS at 12 months to 40% 
compared with an historical control value of 20% at a one- sided 5% significance level. Based on asymptotic z -
test for proportions, 29 patients with a known outcome are needed (i .e., known GVHD, relapse or death status 
at 12 months).  We will recruit 32 subjects to allow for approximately 10% loss to follow -up by 1 year . Patients 
who have received at least one dose of tocilizumab would still be followed if they are withdrawn from the study.  
  
9.5 Stopping Rules 
 
Formal statistical toxicity monitoring will be in place for 100 -day overall mortality. Based on program 
experience, a 100 -day mortality rate <10% is expected. The monitoring boundary was selected to provide a 
10% probability of declaring excessive mortality , if the true probability is 10%. The following table shows the 
number of 100- day mortality events that would trigger a safety review depending on the number of evaluable 
patients . For the purposes of the safety monitoring patients in the safety set who are alive with at least 100 
days of follow -up or have died within 100 days are considered evaluable.

10 DATA  AND SAFETY MONITORING PLAN (DSMP) 
Data and Safety Management Overview  
The MCW CC DSMC and the MCW IRB  will approve p rotocol -specific DSM plans . A local, investigator -
initiated trial will be required to be continuously monitored by the principal investigator of the study with safety 
and progress reports submitted to the DSMC .  
The D SMP for this study will involve  the following entities : 
 
10.1 Study  Team  
The study team minimally consists of the principal investigator, the clinical research coordinator , regulatory 
specialist  and the study biostatistician. While subjects are on treatment, the principal i nvestigator  will meet 
regularly with the research coordinator and the study biostatistician to review study status . This review will 
include but not be limited to  reportable SAEs and UPIRSOs  and an update of the ongoing study summary that 
describes study progress in terms of the study schema. The appropriateness of further subject enrollment and the specific intervention for a next subject enrollment is  addressed. All meetings including attendance are 
documented .  
 10.2 Quality  Assurance   
The MCWCC Clinical Trials O ffice (MCWCC CTO)  provides ongoing quality assurance audits . Quality 
Assurance: This protocol  was classified as intermediate risk and will be reviewed internally by the MCW 
Cancer Center Clinical Trials Office Quality Assurance Staff according to the current version SOP, 6.5.2 Internal Quality Assurance Reviews.  
10.3 Clinical  Trials Office  
The MCWCC CTO provides administrative assistance and support to the DSMC.

  Version Date: 09/19 /2019   
10.4 DSMC  
The MCWCC  places the highest priority on ensuring the safety of patients participating in clinical tri als. Every 
cancer interventional trial conducted at MCW includes a plan for safety and data monitoring.  
More information can be found related to the MCWCC Data and Safety Monitoring Plan at the MCWCC website ( Data and Safety Monitoring Plan
).  
This study will be reviewed by the MCWCC DSMC. A summary of the MCWCC DSMC activities are as follows:  
 Review the clinical tria l for data integrity and safety  
 Review all unexpected grade 3, and all grade 4, and 5 adverse events, as well as any others requiring expedited reporting as defined in this protocol (Grades 4 and 5 events must be reported to the DSMC 
within five  calendar days of study staff’s knowledge.)   
Grade ≤4 hematological AEs occurring within the first 28 days post -transplant will be routine reported 
to the DSMC . 
 Review all DSM reports  
 Submit a summary of any recommendations related to study conduct  
 Terminate the study if deemed unsafe for patients  
A copy of the MCWCC Data and Safety Monitoring Plan and membership roster will be maintained in the study research file and updated as membership changes. The committee will review reports from the study P I 
twice annually (or more frequently if needed) and provide recommendations on trial continuation, suspension 
or termination as necessary.  
Any available DSMC letters will be submitted to the IRB of record as required. 
11 REGULATORY COMPLIANCE, ETHICS  AND STUDY MANAGEMENT  
11.1 Ethical  Standard  
This study will be conducted in accordance with the ethical principles that have their origin in the  Declaration 
of Helsinki as stated in 21 CFR §312.120(c)(4); consistent with GCP and all applicable regulatory requirements.  
 
11.2 Regulatory  Compliance 
This study will be conducted in compliance with:  
 The pr otocol  
 Federal regulations, as a pplica ble, including: 21 CFR 50 (Protection of Human Subjects/Informed 
Consent); 21 CFR 56 (Institutional Review Boards)  and §312 (Investigational New Drug Application ; 
and 45 CFR 46  Subparts A (Common Rule), B (Pregnant Women, Human Fetuses and Neonates), C 
 
 
IIT-Chhabra- Proactive  58 Version No. 4  
  Version Date: 09/19 /2019  (Prison ers), and D (Children), GCP/ICH guidelines, and all applicable regulatory requirements. The 
IRB must comply with the regulations in 21 CFR §56 and applicable regulatory requirements.  
11.3  Prestudy Documentation   
Prior to implementing this protocol at MCWCC, the protocol, informed consent form, HIPAA authorization and 
any other information pertaining to participants must be approved by the MCW IRB.  
 11.4 Institutional  Review Board  
The protocol, the proposed informed consent form and all forms of participant information related to the study (e.g. advertisements used to recruit participants) will be reviewed and approved by the MCW  Institutional 
Review Board. Prior to obtaining approval, the protocol must be approved by the Medical College of 
Wisconsin Cancer Center Scientific Review Committee . The initial protocol and all protocol amendments must 
be approved by the IRB prior to implementation.  
 
Informed Consent Process 
Informed consent is a process that is initiated prior to the individual’s agreeing to participate in the study and continues throughout the individual’s study participation. Extensive discussion of risks and possible benefits of this therapy will be provided to the subjects and their families. Consent forms describing in detail the study 
interventions/ products, study procedures  and risks are given to the subject and written documentation of 
informed consent is required prior to starting intervention/administering study product.  
Consent forms will be IRB approved and the subject (and Legally Authorized Representative, if necessary ) will 
be asked to read and review the document. Upon reviewing the document, the investigator will explain the 
research study to the subject and answer  any questions that may arise. In accordance with 46 CR 46.111, t he 
subject will sign and date the informed consent document prior to any procedures being done specifically for the study.  
A witness should only sign when required, per FH/MCW IRB policy. If a witness signs the document when not required, the study staff should document in the legal medical record (or note to file) the relationship to the patient and why a witness signed. (i.e. , “Although not required, the subject’s spouse was present during the 
consenting process and signed as the witness.” Or “Although not required, hospital staff was present for consenting process and signed as a witness.”) 
The subjects will  have the opportunity to discuss the study with their surrogates or think about it prior to 
agreeing to participate. The subjects may withdraw consent at any time throughout the course of the trial .  
A copy of the informed consent document will be given to the subjects for their records. The rights and welfare 
of the subjects will be protected by emphasizing to them that the quality of their medical care will not be adversely affected if they decline to participate in this study.  If there are changes to the consent form, all 
revisions will be reviewed with study subject at the next appropriate opportunity. Patients that require reconsenting will be defined in the IRB approved amendment submission. The process for obtaining informed 
 
 
IIT-Chhabra- Proactive  59 Version No. 4  
  Version Date: 09/19 /2019  consent will again be performed. Study subjects will not be reconsented for continuing reviews.  The MCWCC 
CTO will follow the MCW/FH IRB’s policy for subjects  who demonstrate limited English proficiency or limited 
literacy .  
After the subject’s visit in which the consent is signed, it is documented in the clinic chart that the consent has 
been signed and that all questions have been answered to the subject’s satisfaction after adequate time for 
review of the consent. It is also documented that a copy of the consent is given to the subject. The original 
consent is kept with the subject’s study file, and a copy of the consent is sent to the OCRICC office, which  will 
then submit to HIM a copy of the signed consent to be scanned into EPIC, the legal medical record.  
 11.5  Subject Confidentiality  and Access to Source Documents/Data  
Subject confidentiality is strictly held in trust by the sponsor -investigator, participating investigators, and any 
staff, [and the sponsor(s) and their agents]. This confidentiality includes the clinical information relating to participating subjects, as well as any genetic or biological testing.  
The study protocol, documentation, data, and all other information generated will be held in strict confidence. 
No information concerning the study, or the data will be released to any unauthorized third party without prior 
written approval of the principal investigator . 
The conditions for maintaining confidentiality of the subjects’ records are required for the life of the data. 
These rules apply equally to any and all MCWCC projects.  
One risk of taking part in a research study is that more people will handle the personal health information collected for this study. The study team will make every effort to protect the information and keep it confidential, but it is possible that an unauthorized person might see it. Depending on the kind of information being collected, it might be used in a way that could embarrass the subject or affect his/her ability to get insurance.  
While data are being collected and after all data have been collected but are still in the process of being 
analyzed, the subject’s data/PHI are  stored in the locked Clinical Research office in the Clinical Trials Office. 
Databases in which the study subject information is stored and accessed are password protected, allowing for limited access by authorized personnel only. Data/PHI kept in the Case Report Forms contain the study 
identifiers, subject initials, date of birth and date of service.  
The principal investigator  will allow access to all source data and documents for the purposes of  monitoring, 
audits, IRB review  and regulatory inspections .  
The study monitor or other authorized representatives of the principal investigator  may inspect all documents 
and records required to be maintained by the investigator, including but not limited to, medical records (office, 
clinic, or hospital) and pharmacy records for the subjects in this study. The clinical study site will permit 
access to such records.  
 
 
 
IIT-Chhabra- Proactive  60 Version No. 4  
  Version Date: 09/19 /2019  11.6 Protection of Human Subjects  
11.6.1 Protection  from Unnecessary Harm  
Each clinical site is responsible for protecting all subjects involved in human experimentation. This  is 
accomplished through the IRB  mechanism and the informed consent process. The IRB  reviews all proposed 
studies involving human experimentation and ensures that the subject’s rights and welfare are protected and 
that the potential benefits and/or the importance of the knowledge to be gained outweigh the risks to the 
individual. The IRB also reviews the informed consent document associated with each study in order to 
ensure that  the consent document accurately and clearly communicates the nature of the research to be done 
and its associated risks and benefits.  
 11.6.2 Protection  of Privacy 
As noted, patients will be informed of the extent to which their confidential health inform ation generated from 
this study may be used for research purposes. Following this discussion, they will be asked to sign informed consent documents. The original signed document will become part of the patient’s medical records, and each 
patient will receive a copy of the signed document.  
 
11.7 Changes in the Protocol  
Once the protocol has been approved by the MCW IRB, any changes to the protocol must be documented in the form of an amendment . The amendment must be signed by the i nvestigator and approved by IRB  prior to 
implementation.  
If it becomes necessary to alter the protocol to eliminate an immediate hazard to patients, an amendment may be implemented prior to IRB approval . In this circum stance, however, the Investigator must then notify the IRB 
in writing within five working days after implementation.  
The IRB  may provide, if applicable regulatory authority(ies) permit, expedited review and approval/favorable 
opinion for minor change(s) in ongoing studies that have the approval /favorable opinion of the IRB. The 
investigator will submit all protocol modifications to the sponsor and the regulatory authority(ies) in accordance with the governing regulations.  
Changes to the protocol may  requi re approval from the sponsor . 
Any departures from the protocol must be fully documented in the source documents.  
 11.8 Investigator  Compliance   
The investigator will conduct the study in compliance with the protocol given approval/favorable opinion by the 
IRB and the appropriate regulatory authority(ies).  
Onsite Audits  
Auditing is essential to ensure that research conducted at the Medical College of Wisconsin (MCW) Cancer 
Center is of the  highest quality and meets MCW and regulatory agency standards.   
 
 
IIT-Chhabra- Proactive  61 Version No. 4  
  Version Date: 09/19 /2019  Regulatory authorities, the IRB and/or sponsor may request access to all source documents, data capture 
records and other study documentation for on- site audit or inspection. Direct access to  these documents must 
be guaranteed by the investigator, who must provide support at all times for these activities.  
12 DATA  HANDLING  AND  RECORD KEEPING

APPENDIX 4 . GUT MICROBIOME STUDY: STOOL SAMPLE COLLECTION AND 
PROCESSING

Sample Information Management for Microbiota Studies   
 
Each stool sample will be given a unique identifier.   
 
For example:  
Patient 0001 and has sample A and B. Patient 0002 has sample A.   
Sample IDs: MCW_0001- A, MCW_0001- B, MCW_0002- A  
  
As we acquire, aliquot, and store samples, we will not to try to squeeze additional information 
(metadata), such as date or day of collection or patient initials into the sample ID.  Such 
additional information becomes very difficult to deal with later and statistical software programs 
can’t deal with them well. Please don’t name samples things like “Pt 002 Week 3” or “Pt 002 pre-
transplant” or “Pt JFK (Day - 2)”.  If a patient has more than one transplant, day and week 
designations are problematic. Another problem with this sort of a sample- naming scheme leads 
to discrepancies between the target time point (e.g. day 30) and the actual timepoint collected 
(e.g. day 32)  
  
The following approach is recommended:   
Keep the names of samples simple and then keep a separate table of sample metadata, as below:

Stool Sample Collection, Processing, and Shipping 
 
Sample Collection  
 
  Suggested collection days:  
                   Inpatient: twice weekly (e.g. Mondays  and Thursdays) – once pre- transplant and 
weekly (+/ - 2 days) post -transplant until after neutrophil engraftment .  
 
Tube Preparation  
     Please aliquot into sturdy tubes that can withstand cold temperatures2. Standard urine- or 
sputum -collection cups crack at freezing temperatures and should not be used.   
     If labeling tubes by hand, please use an alcohol -proof marker3. Sharpie, etc. will dissolve in 
the ethanol used during DNA extraction.   
     If using printed labels, please ensure that they will not peel, crack, or smear at freezing 
temperatures4, 5.  
  
Aliquoting  
     Aliquoting should be done as soon as possible after sample is received.  
     For solid or semi -solid samples, use a clean disposable spatula6 to transfer stool into 
cryovials2.  
o  Prepare 5 aliquots of ~0.5 mL each.  
o  For more liquid samples, can transfer up to 1 mL material.  
     For liquid samples, use transfer pipette7 to prepare 1.5 mL aliquots of material.  
     All aliquots should be stored at -80 until shipping.

Clinical phase Ia/Ib
Trial rationale BI 905711 is a tetravalent bispecific antibody targeting both 
TRAILR2 and CDH17 and is designed to selectively induce apoptosis in CDH17 expressing tumour cells via CDH17- dependent clustering of TRAILR2. The combination of TRAILR2/CDH17 antibody with chemotherapy aims to increase the apoptotic signal by the activation of both the intrinsic and the extrinsic apoptosis pathways in cancer cells. In relevant preclinical GI cancer models including colorectal cancer and pancreatic adenocarcinoma, BI 905711 showed efficacy as single agent and in combination with chemotherapy agents like capecitabine, irinotecan, paclitaxel and oxaliplatin. Moreover, pro-apoptotic priming with irinotecan followed 24 hours later by BI 905711 led to a synergistic effect as compared to co-administration on the same day (data on file). These data are consistent with published data demonstrating that pre-treatment with chemotherapy eg. cisplatin and irinotecan, sensitizes cancer cells to TRAILR2 agonistic antibodies and the sequential administration might overcome resistance (see section 1.3for more details).
The first-in-human trial 1412-0001 is assessing BI 905711 as monotherapy in patients with advanced or metastatic GI cancers. In Phase Ia, 45 patients (26 with CRC, 19 with non-CRC GI cancers) have received BI 905711 (dose range 0.02–4.8 mg/kg). No safety concerns or dose-limiting toxicities have been observed to date and the MTD was not reached.Based on safety, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic profiles, as well as preliminary antitumor activity of BI 905711, three dose levels (0.6 mg/kg, 1.2 mg/kg and 2.4 mg/kg) given biweekly or one dose level (0.6 mg/kg) given weekly were selected for assessment of BI 905711 monotherapy in 1412-0001 expansion phase 1b.
Trial objective(s) Phase Ia:
∀To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the 
recommended dose for expansion (RDE) of BI 905711 in

Statistical methods Phase Ia: Dose escalation is guided by a BLRM with overdose control 
that will be fitted to binary toxicity outcomes (DLTs). The estimate of parameters will be updated as data are accumulated using the BLRM. Available safety data from BI Study 1412-0001 can be incorporated into the prior derivation meta-analytic predictive (MAP) approach.
Phase Ib: Primary and secondary endpoints will be analyzed
descriptively. If additional DLTs are observed during the safety run-in phase, a separate BLRM with overdose control will be used to re-estimate the recommended dose for PDAC cohort.

(*)Each treatment Cycle has a duration of 14 days. 
(**) Patients who discontinue trial treatment should undergo the End of Treatment (EoT) visit as soon as possible (Day 0-14 after tr eatment discontinuation). 
If assessments due at EoT are not completed, they may be performed at the End of Residual Effect Period (EoR) visit, which is a lso considered the first Follow-Up 
(FUP) Visit. 
(***)The End of Residual Effect Period (EoR) visit (FUP #1) should occur 30 (+5) days after the last dose of treatment (see Section 6.2.3.2 ).
(##) FUP visits For Progressive Disease (PD)
If a patient does not have documented progression prior to or at the EoR visit he/she will continue to have regular FUP visits for PD which will occur per the imaging 
schedule. Assessments will be performed as indicated in the Flow Chart.
The FUP visits for PD will end at the earliest once one of the following events is met:
∀Confirmation of Disease progression
∀Start of a new anti–cancer therapy 
∀Death
∀Lost to Follow-Up
∀End of whole trial as specified in Section 8.6.
The following will be obtained and/or performed during the FUP visits for progression.
∀Perform tumor assessment including physical examination and imaging. 
∀ECOG performance score
∀Treatment date with any subsequent anti-cancer drug / therapy including the name and type of the anti-cancer drug and/or best s upportive care (if applicable).
∀Outcome (date of and reason for death [if applicable], in case the patient had PD the actual date of PD shall be recorded)
(##) FUP for survival status
Once the FUP visits for progression end for patients with either a confirmation of disease progression or have started a new an ti-cancer therapy, the FUP for survival 
status will start and be performed approximately every 12 weeks (+/-7 days) in person, by telephone or via written corresponden ce until death, lost to follow-up, 
withdrawal of consent, or end of the whole trial (see Section 6.2.3.3 and 8.6).
The following patient status information will be collected during the FUP timepoints for survival status:
∀Date of contact
∀Further anti-cancer treatment including surgery and radiotherapy: regimen and drug name, start and stop dates.
∀For each reportable serious adverse event / AESI, the investigator should provide the information with regard to concomitant me dication and the medication 
administered to treat the adverse events on the appropriate CRF pages and the SAE form including trade name, indication and dat es of administration

1. Written informed consent must be obtained before any protocol specific screening assessments are performed. Re-consenting may become necessary when new 
relevant information becomes available and should be conducted according to the Sponsor’s instructions. Separate consent is to b e obtained for optional biomarker 
sampling
2. Cycle 1, Day 1: Inclusion and exclusion criteria must be confirmed prior to first dose.
From Cycle 2 Day 1 onwards: Eligibility for further treatment should be confirmed prior to each dosing day (Day 1 of each cycle) by confirming the patient h as not 
met any criteria for protocol discontinuation as described in section 3.3.4.1 and absence of any adverse event requiring treatment delay or discontinuation (section 
4.1.5.2 and 4.2.3 ). 
3. A full physical exam is inclusive of vitals, body weight and height. With the exception of height (performed only at Screening) , a full physical is to be performed at 
Screening, at Day 1 of each cycle, at EoT, EoR and at further FUP visits for progression if applicable. Physical exam does not need to be repeated at Cycle 1 Day 1 if 
completed within the previous 24hours . See Section 4.1.5.1 for additional timepoints for assessing signs and symptoms of IRR and CRS on drug administration days. 
Patients should also be assessed for any new neurological signs and symptoms. See section 4.2.4.5 .
4. For all cycles including cycle 1, weight can be collected up to 3 da ys prior to the visit. If the patient’s weight changes by ≤10% compared to the reference weight, the 
dose (in mg) may remain the same for subsequent cycles. If the wei ght changes by >10% the dose will be recalculated and the new  weight will be used as the reference 
weight.
5. ECOG assessment to be performed at Screening, and Day 1 of each cycle, at EoT, EoR and at further FUP visits for progression if applicable . ECOG does not need to 
be repeated at Cycle 1 Day 1 if screening ECOG was completed within 72hours of Cycle 1 Day 1.
6. A urine pregnancy test is mandatory for female patients of childbearing potential and must be performed within 72 hours prior to start of study treatment (Day 1) at 
every 2 cycles and at EoT. If a urine pregnancy test is positive, a serum pregnancy test must be performed and resulted as nega tive prior to trial drug administration.
7. ECG to be performed at Screening, Day 1 of Cycles 3 and at EoR. An ECG can be added as well as repeated as clinically indicated  per investigator’s discretion.
8. Dispensing of BI 905711 will be performed via the Interactive Response Technology (IRT). BI 905711 dose administrations must always be at least 14 days 
apart. Patients will remain under surveillance for at least 6 hours after the end of infusion during the first, second and third admin istrations of BI 905711. During the 
post-infusion observation period, body temperature, pulse rate and blood pressure will be measured at the end of the infusion a nd every 2 hours (± 15 minutes) 
thereafter.See Section 4.1.5.1 for additional details of this observation period. 
8.1. The infusion of FOLFIRI (or Liposomal Irinotecan plus 5-FU/Leucovorin (PDAC only)) with or without bevacizumab will be don e per local labels (See 
section 4for more details of background administration)

001-MCS-40-106_RD -03 (19.0) / Saved on: 05 Nov 20209. Safety Lab testing will be performed locally and includes blood for Hematology, Biochemistry, Hepatitis and Coagulation, as wel l as Urinalysis. Refer to protocol 
Section 5.2.3 for specific laboratory requirements.
- Safety lab tests performed during screening do not need to be repeated at Cycle 1 Day 1 if performed within 10 days prior to t reatment start and there is no 
clinical reason to repeat lab tests.
- During Cycle 1, safety labs should be performed on Day 3 (pre-dose), 4-6 hours post BI 905711 administration, on Day 4 (24 hr t imepoint), and on Day 10.
- During subsequent Cycles, safety labs on Day 1 should be performed within 48 hours prior to Day 1. During Cycle 2 and 3, safet y lab should be performed on 
Day 1 and Day 3.  
- All safety lab tests can be repeated at any other time points, if clinically indicated, at investigator’s discretion.- Safety labs are also performed at EoT and EoR visit and may be repeated if clinically indicated. 
- At the Screening visit only, patients are to be tested for Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) and Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) infection which  includes hepatitis B surface 
   antigen (HbsAg), Hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc), HBV-DNA, as well as HCV RNA. Results for hepatitis virus infection obtai ned in routine diagnostics 
   are acceptable if done within 14 days before the informed consent date. Also refer to exclusion criteria for criteria for act ive infection.
10. For detailed information about pharmacokinetics (PK), Anti-drug antibodies (ADA), Neutralizing anti-drug antibodies (Nab), cell  death biomarkers, and circulating 
tumor DNA (cfDNA) sampling timepoints and handling procedures, refer to Appendix 10.2. ADA sampling may be amended based on available data. If the 
patient will not continue treatment in the next cycle, pre-dose sampling scheduled for Day 3 of the next cycle (see Appendix 10 .2) needs to be performed at the 
EoT visit. For cfDNA, first sample should be collected at baseline (Cycle 1, Day 1) before start of trial treatment. For subseq uent cfDNA sample collection 
refer to Section 5.4.1 and Appendix 10.2 for more details on collection time points.
11. Tumor tissue collection during Screening:
For Phase Ia-
oFor all patients : Provision of an archived tumor tissue specimen is mandatory during screening . A fresh biopsy is only mandatory for patients who do not 
have archival tissue. 
For Phase Ib-
oFor all patients : Provision of archival tumor tissue or fresh biopsy is mandatory for all patients prior to treatment start on Day 1. Fresh bio psy sample 
should be provided if the archival tissue tested is greater than 6 months old from collection to start of treatment on this stu dy. Even if fresh biopsy 
conducted, provision of an archived tumor tissue is recommended. For Non-CRC patients , CDH17 expression measurement by archival tumor tissue or 
fresh biopsy sample must be completed prior to treatment start on Day 1.
Only non-significant risk procedures per the investigator’s judgment will be used to obtain any biopsies specified in this stud y. For CRC patients only, in case a fresh 
tumor biopsy cannot be obtained, the recruitment of the patient may proceed on a case-by-case basis after agreement between the  investigator and BI. In such a case, an 
archived tumor tissue specimen needs to be submitted.
12. For Phase Ib only: On-treatment tumor tissue collection at Cycle 2 Day 5, 48 h±4 after administration of BI 905711(optional) and/or at disease pro gression (EOT) 
(optional) for a patient in which a fresh biopsy has been successfully obtained before first study treatment.

001-MCS-40-106_RD -03 (19.0) / Saved on: 05 Nov 202013. CRC patients only: [18F]FDG-PET/CT should be pe rformed during screening and no later than 14 days (±7 days) prior to treatment start (Cycle 1 Day 1) af ter 
eligibility has been confirmed. A second [18F]FDG-PET/CT w ill be performed at the 8-w eek (±7 days) tumor assessment timepoint. It may be performed together with 
standard CT assessment if feasible. See section 5.4.2.6 for additional [18F]FDG-PET/CT details including patient fasting and voiding requirements.
14. After the patient’s end of trial, the investigator does not need to actively monitor the patient for new AEs but should report any occurrence of cancer and trial  drug 
related SAEs and trial drug related AESIs of which the investigator may become aware of by any means of communication, e.g. phon e call. Those AEs should be 
reported on the BI SAE form but not on the CRF, see Section 5.2.6.2.1 .
15. Tumor assessment should include CT scans or MRI of the chest, abdomen, pelvis and, if clinically indicated, imaging of any othe r known or suspected sites of 
disease (e.g. brain, bone). The same radiographic procedure must be used throughout the study. Tumor assessment does not need to  be performed at the Screening visit if 
there are valid results available from assessments which were performed as part of routine clinical practice within 28 days pri or to start of treatment. Repeat tumor 
assessment will be performed every 8 weeks (± 7 days) until progression or start of further treatment for disease.In the event of early discontinuation for reasons other than progressive disease or interruption/delay of treatment, the tumor assessment schedule should not be changed. 
If the patient finishes study treatment without having progressive disease, tumor assessment/imaging must be performed at the ti me of treatment discontinuation, unless 
it has been done within the past 4 weeks. CEA, CA19.9, etc., tumor marker levels should be obtained at baseline, every 2 cycles and at every protocol-specified tumor assessment timepoint in CRC and PDAC 
patients, respectively. 
16.Only in cases where the Investigator (or the treating physician or both) suspects cardiac disease with negative effect on the EF , will the EF be measured during 
screening using an appropriate method according to local standards to confirm eligibility (e.g., echocardiogram, multi-gated ac quisition scan). A historic measurement of 
EF no older than 6 months prior to first administration of study drug can be accepted provided that there is clinical evidence that the EF value has not worsened since 
this measurement in the opinion of the Investigator or of the treating physician or both.
17.  PRO-CTCAE should be conducted on Day 1 (allowance -1 day) of each cycle until Cycle 5, and Day 10 (allowance ±2 day) of cycle 1 and cycles 3. From Cycle 5, 
PRO-CTCAE should be conducted on Day 1 (allowance -1 day) of every 2 cycles (Cycle 7, 9, 11 and so on).

001-MCS-40-106_RD -03 (19.0) / Saved on: 05 Nov 20201. INTRODUCTION
1.1 MEDICAL BACKGROUND
Tumor cell death and apoptosis can be induced by activation of the extrinsic apoptosis 
pathway via targeting TRAIL (TNF Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand) receptors ( R16-
1878 ). TRAILR2 represents a valid target for anti-cancer treatment, but conventional 
TRAILR2 antibodies have not been successful in the clinic so far due to insufficient agonistic 
properties or liver toxicity ( P16-04691 )(R17-2985 ). 
Published data suggest that activation of TRAIL receptor depends not only on binding of the 
ligand to the receptor but requires also a hyperclustering of the receptor that is critical for apoptosis induction ( R17-2986 ). Agonistic properties of TRAILR2 antibodies can be highly 
enhanced by antibody immobilisation via binding of their Fc part on the solid surface in-vitro
or FcR cross-linking on membrane of the tumor infiltrating immune cells in-vivo (R17-2987 ). 
1.2 DRUG PROFILE
Mode of action
BI 905711 is a tetravalent bispecific molecule targeting both TRAILR2 and Cadherin 17 
(CDH17), and it is designed to selectively induce apoptosis in CDH17 expressing tumor cells via the CDH17-dependent clustering of TRAILR2 ( R17-4112 ). CDH17 is a cell surface 
molecule expressed in gastrointestinal (GI) adenocarcinomas ( R18-1615 )(R17-4114 ).
In humans, CDH17 is also present on normal cells of the stomach, intestine, pancreas and gall 
bladder, but it is not expressed in normal liver tissue. Normal GI tissues were shown to be resistant to TRAILR2-induced apoptosis ( R16-4563 ) while liver tissue may be sensitive to 
TRAILR2 activation ( R16-1795 ). 
The L234A/L235A mutations were incorporated into the BI 905711 molecule to specifically 
avoid CDH17-independent cross-linking by ablating binding to Fc #R and complements. BI 
905711 has the potential to avoid hepatotoxicity associated with clustering of TRAILR2 and apoptosis induction in the liver (R16-1795) due to the lack of detectable CDH17 protein in normal liver tissue ( R17-2598 ). Moreover, the non-neoplastic tissues with CDH17 expression 
as listed above, should be spared from apoptosis and tissue damage due to their low 
sensitivity to TRAILR2 activation ( R17-4113 , R16-4563 ). For a more detailed description of 
the BI 905711 pharmacologic profile, refer to the current Investigator’s Brochure (IB) 
(c16856466 ).
Key pharmacokinetic (PK) characteristics
Preliminary PK results from the Phase I FIH study 1412-0001, using planned PK sampling 
timepoints, were available for patients treated in at dose levels 1-8 (0.02 mg/kg-4..8 mg/kg,

001-MCS-40-106_RD -03 (19.0) / Saved on: 05 Nov 2020total N=42 patients in 1412-0001 clinical trial. Following intravenous administration of BI 
905711, peak plasma concentrations occurred around the end of the infusion at 0.5 h. Terminal Half life was about 3 days at 1.2 mg/kg dose and above. Inter-patient variability was evident. The maximum plasma concentrations (Cmax) were comparable between cycle 1 and cycle 3.The systemic exposure (AUC
0-336) values of BI 905711 were comparable between cycle 1 and 
cycle 3. Thus, no accumulation was seen between cycle 1 and cycle 3 at the analyzed dose levels between cycle 1 and cycle 3.
Distribution
No dedicated distribution studies have been performed. 
Metabolism
BI 905711 is a protein and is expected to undergo protein catabolism in humans to peptides 
and amino acids. Dedicated metabolism studies were not conducted for BI 905711.
Excretion
The molecular weight of BI 905711 is approximately 201 kDa, which is above the renal
filtration cut-off threshold (approximately 60 kDa). Dedicated excretion studies were notconducted.
Pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions
BI 905711 is a protein, and its clearance is through protein catabolism. BI 905711
is not an immune modulator and is not expected to impact expression and production ofcytochrome P450 enzyme or certain drug transporters that may affect indirectly the exposureof co-administered small molecules. Therefore, pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactionbetween BI 905711 and co-administered small molecules is not expected. 
Residual Effect Period (REP)
The expected REP of BI 905711 is 30 days (+ 5 days). This is the period after the last dose 
with measurable drug levels and/or pharmacodynamic effects still likely to be present.
Data from non-clinical studies
BI 905711 demonstrated high preclinical anti-tumor activity in-vitro and in-vivo in CDH17 
positive tumor cell lines. A short summary is given below. For more details, refer to the current IB ( c16856466 ).
The sensitivity to BI 905711 of a panel of 24 CDH17-positive CRC cell lines was evaluated
and is shown in Figure 1.2: 1 . A V-shaped dose-response is predicted for this bi-specific 
antibody where concentrations above the optimum will favour individual target recruitment, 
thus preventing TRAILR2 cross-linking and therefore reducing efficacy. Within the range of concentrations tested, different cell lines showed a reduced efficacy when using higher than optimal doses. Importantly, despite differences in CDH17 and TRAILR2 protein expression levels and the intrinsic sensitivity to TRAILR2 agonists among these cells, there was a common concentration range inducing the maximal effect in all tested cells (Figure 1.2: 1)

BI 905711 was also tested in CDH17 negative liver-derived cells, and Hep G2 was used as a 
surrogate for TRAIL sensitive hepatocytes. In Hep G2 cells, no significant effect of BI 905711 decreasing cell viability was observed. The potent tetrameric nanobody agonist targeting TRAILR2 (EX 77749) was used as a reference for sensitivity to TRAILR2 agonists. As expected for a CDH17-independent molecule, a significant effect of EX 77749 decreasing cell viability was observed independently of the absence of CDH17 membrane expression (Figure 1.2: 2 ).

BI 905711 in vivo efficacy was demonstrated in the COLO 205 xenograft tumor model, 
where a single dose administration (0.3, 1, 5 and 15 mg/Kg) led to significant growth inhibition for all treatment groups. The GP2d cell line was selected as a second CRC xenograft tumor model for in vivo profiling of BI 905711. Compared to COLO 205 derived 
tumor samples, CDH17 distribution in GP2d derived tumor samples was more similar to those of metastatic CRC patients. BI 905711 was initially administered at doses of 1.67, 5 and 15 mg/kg. After a single dose, BI 905711 administered at 1.67 mg/kg led to sustained tumor regressions for most of the tumors from day 6 until day 36 (end of the experiment). In a follow up study, BI 905711 was administered at lower doses (0.05, 0.2, 0.8, and 1.67mg/kg). Similar to the 1.67mg/kg group, BI 905711 administered at 0.8 mg/kg as a singledose led to sustained tumor regressions for most of the tumors from day 3 until day 29. Theminimal efficacious dose was defined as 0.2 mg/kg with only a few regressions as compared 
to the 1.67 and 0.8 mg/kg groups but still demonstrated statistically significant tumor growth
inhibition at the end of the experiment.
To evaluate the combination potential of BI 905711 with chemotherapeutics, in vivo efficacy 
experiments in several CRC and gastric-esophageal xenograft tumor models were performed(P19-11314 , P20-10420 ). Combination of BI 905711 with irinotecan or paclitaxel or 
oxaliplatin, resulted in a statistically significant tumor growth control, as compared with 
vehicle and either compound as monotherapy.

001-MCS-40-106_RD -03 (19.0) / Saved on: 05 Nov 2020Preclinical toxicology
Preclinical toxicology is fully described in the IB ( c16856466 ). BI 905711 intravenously 
administered once per week to cynomolgus monkeys for 6 weeks up to dose levels of 100 
mg/kg produced no overt adverse effects. No changes in clinical pathology (hematology, clinical chemistry, urinalysis), ophthalmology, or immunophenotyping were observed, nor were any alterations to body weight or food consumption apparent. The majority of treated monkeys displayed ADAs to BI 905711 at the end of the 6-week drug phase, which slightly reduced total exposure (AUC
0-168) when compared to the first administration.
BI 905711-related effects in the 6-week monkey study were limited to microscopic findings
in the brain (choroid plexus, meninges of the cerebrum, and/or cerebral cortex) at ≥ 30 
mg/kg, and in the spinal cord (meninges, gray matter) and kidney (glomerulus) at 100 mg/kg. Changes in the brain and spinal cord were characterized by minimal to mild perivascular mononuclear cell infiltrates that contained admixed eosinophils. In animals allowed a 4-week recovery phase, changes in the choroid plexus and meninges of the brain remained apparent, but no findings were noted in the spinal cord. The perivascular accumulation of mononuclear 
cell infiltrates may represent immune responses originating within the Virchow-Robin space, 
continuous with the subarachnoid space and outside of the blood-brain barrier. In the kidney, glomerulopathy was observed in monkeys at the end of treatment and recovery phases and was considered related to BI 905711 administration, although no alterations to serum blood urea nitrogen and creatinine or urinary protein were observed. Immunohistochemical (IHC)staining of affected tissues revealed granular deposits containing human IgG (BI 905711) and/or monkey IgG in the kidneys of animals displaying glomerulopathy. These deposits are 
consistent with immune complex formation, deposition, and clearance in monkeys that have generated ADA in response to administration of a heterologous protein. An immune complex-mediated basis for the perivascular mononuclear cell infiltrates with admixed eosinophils in the brain and/or spinal cord could not be confirmed by IHC staining.No hemolytic or local effects due to BI 905711 intravenous injection were noted. BI 905711 did not cause in vitro cytokine release (c16856466).
Data from clinical studies
The first-in-human trial 1412-0001 assessing BI 905711 as monotherapy in patients with 
treatment-refractory GI cancers has been initiated in several countries and is currently ongoing.
For a more detailed description of the BI 905711 profile (limited clinical data are available so 
far), refer to the current IB (c16856466).  
1.3 RATIONALE FOR PERFORMING THE TRIAL
Efficacy of current standard of care therapies for GI cancers at advanced or metastatic stage 
is limited. The majority of these patients die due to resistance to therapy, thus there is a need to develop new treatment approaches.
BI 905711 is a tetravalent bispecific antibody targeting both TRAILR2 and CDH17, and is 
designed to selectively induce apoptosis in CDH17 expressing tumour cells via CDH17-dependent clustering of TRAILR2. CDH17 is a membrane protein that is expressed only in

potential to avoid liver toxicity.
The potential indications for BI 905711 include GI adenocarcinomas expressing CDH17 
including but not limited to: CRC, gastric, oesophageal, pancreatic and biliary tract cancers as indicated in Table 1.3: 1. CRC consistently expresses CDH17 at a high or intermediate level by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in both primary tumors and metastatic sites ( R17-2598 , 
R18-1615 ). High CDH17 expression in metastatic CRC samples was confirmed in a BI 
prevalence study and showed CDH17 expression in 100 % of the samples analyzed (n=39), 
and 97% of the samples showed CDH17 expression on over 50% of the tumor cells (77% of samples with >90% positive cells). Expression of CDH17 in gastric, oesophageal, and pancreatic adenocarcinomas and biliary tract cancers is more variable.

BI 905711 can potentially activate TRAILR2 on both CDH17 positive tumor cells and 
adjacent tumor cells (cis- and trans-activation). BI 905711 can therefore induce TRAILR2 activation in the CDH17 negative cells if surrounded by CDH17 positive cells.
BI 905711 showed efficacy in relevant GI cancer preclinical models as single agent and in 
combination with chemotherapy agents like capecitabine, irinotecan, paclitaxel and oxaliplatin.
Chemotherapy combinations commonly used in first- and second-line treatment of CRC 
include leucovorin calcium, fluorouracil (5-FU) and irinotecan (FOLFIRI regimen), or leucovorin, 5-FU and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX regimen) with or without an anti- angiogenic agents such as bevacizumab, or, if RAS wild type, an EGFR antibody. 
Second-line treatment options in metastatic pancreatic cancer depend on the therapies

on prior gemcitabine-based treatment), gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel, FOLFOX, or single agent gemcitabine or 5-FU, ( R20-3885 ).
Chemotherapy induces apoptosis via activation of the intrinsic pathway while 
TRAILR2/CDH17 antibody induces apoptosis via the activation of the extrinsic pathway.Thus, the combination of BI 905711 with FOLFIRI (+/- bevacizumab) should increase the apoptosis signal by the activation of both intrinsic and extrinsic apoptosis pathways in cancer cells. An increased efficacy of BI 905711 in combination with chemotherapy has been observed in CRC GP2d xenograft models ( c16856466 ). BI 905711 plus irinotecan or 
oxaliplatin showed increased efficacy in the CRC GP2d xenograft models as compared to 
single agents. The combination with irinotecan showed the deepest and longest tumor growth control. Moreover, the efficacy of the sequential administration of irinotecan and BI 905711 was analysed in preclinical models by measuring the induction of caspase cleavage in tumor tissue at baseline and at several timepoints on treatment. The results showed that pro-apoptotic priming with irinotecan followed, 24 hours later, by the administration of BI 
905711 led to the highest synergistic effect (cCasp3 activation) as compared to co-
administration on the same day (data on file). These data are consistent with published data demonstrating that pre-treatment with chemotherapy eg. cisplatin or irinotecan, sensitizes cancer cells to TRAILR2 agonistic antibodies and the sequential administration might overcome resistance ( R21-2020 , R21-2040 , R21-2041 ).
The first-in-human trial 1412-0001 is assessing BI 905711 as monotherapy in patients with
advanced or metastatic GI cancers. In Phase Ia, 45 patients (26 with CRC, 19 with non-CRC GI cancers) have received BI 905711 (dose range 0.02–4.8 mg/kg). No safety concerns or dose-limiting toxicities have been observed to date (c16856466) and the MTD was not reached. Based on safety, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic profiles, as well as preliminary antitumor activity of BI 905711, three dose levels (0.6 mg/kg, 1.2 mg/kg and 2.4 mg/kg) given biweekly or one dose level (0.6 mg/kg) given weekly were selected for assessment of BI 905711 monotherapy in 1412-0001 expansion phase 1b.
As of Apr 2022, 37 out of 45 (82.2%) patients treated with BI 905711 monotherapy (dose 
range 0.02 mg/kg-4.8 mg/kg) experienced at least 1 adverse event (AE). Most of the reported AEs were consistent with known signs and symptoms of advanced colorectal, biliary and pancreatic cancers. 15 out of 45 patients experienced grade 1-3 drug-related AEs consisting of general disorders and administration site conditions, and gastrointestinal disorders. A total of 11 patients experienced SAEs, and 2 events were considered drug-related by the investigators.
There were no dose-limiting toxicities identified and there was no pattern of any anticipated 
adverse effects (see section 7 of the current BI 905711 investigator’s brochure). There were 4
AEs leading to dose reduction and/or discontinuations of study medication. In addition, there 
was no evidence of any dose/(adverse) effect relationship regarding both frequency as well as severity.

In order to address future scientific questions, patients will be asked to voluntarily donate 
biospecimens for banking (please see Section 5.5). If the patient agrees, banked samples may 
be used for future biomarker research and drug development projects, e.g. to identify patients 
that are more likely to benefit from a treatment or to experience an adverse event (AE), or to gain a mechanistic or genetic understanding of drug effects and thereby better match patients with therapies.
Based on available preliminary data from phase I clinical studies (1412.1 and 1412.3), the 
decision was made to terminate BI 905711 (TRAILR2/CDH17) development program. This decision is not related to any safety concerns or unfavorable benefit/risk balance, but to the lack of predictive biomarkers and the limited efficacy particularly in the context of the 
evolving treatment landscape for advanced CRC and other GI cancers.
The purpose of CTP v4.0 is to reduce the study related activities to the minimum required to 
monitor patient safety and to avoid undue burden on patients.
1.4 BENEFIT - RISK ASSESSMENT
1.4.1 Benefits
Most patients with advanced or metastatic GI cancers have limited effective treatment 
options, develop resistance to currently available therapies, and succumb to their disease. BI 905711 in combination with chemotherapy (+/- bevacizumab) can potentially provide a new therapeutic option for these patients as suggested by its efficacy in relevant preclinical GI cancer models and further supported by extensive pharmacology and toxicology preclinical data.
1.4.2 Risks
TRAILR2 agonistic antibodies, both as single agents and in combination with chemotherapy, 
have been extensively tested in the clinic and showed a good safety profile with the exception of TAS266 ( R16-1795 ). The majority of these compounds did not induce dose limiting 
toxicities (DLTs) in phase I trials with no established maximum tolerated dose (MTD). 
Treatment-related adverse events (AEs) reported with these compounds mostly included GIAEs (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, stomatitis, decreased appetite) and elevation of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and pancreatic amylase ( R16-1793 , 
R16-1794 , R17-2590 , R17-2600 , R17-2601 , R16-4524 , R17-2606 , R18-2222 ). There is 
limited clinical experience with the second generation of compounds inducing TRAILR2 
clustering independently of FcR interactions. Phase I data of the TRAILR2 binding tetramer (TAS 266) reported reversible liver toxicity at the first administered dose level leading to TAS 266 discontinuation from further development ( R16-1795 ). Published pre-clinical and

may have contributed to the observed liver toxicity ( R16-1800 , R18-2222 ). Another 
TRAILR2 agonist (ABBV-621) currently under clinical investigation reported mainly liver 
and GI AEs with no defined MTD, and 1 partial response out of 24 patients each in CRC and pancreatic cancer patients ( R18-2222 ). A bi-specific compound targeting TRAILR2 and FAP 
(RG 7386) has completed phase I with no reported DLTs and MTD ( R18-1695 ).
So far AEs reported were consistent with known signs and symptoms of an end-stage CRC 
population. A total of11 patients experienced SAEs, and 2 events were considered drug-related by the investigator. There were no dose-limiting toxicities identified and there was no pattern of any anticipated safety topics (acc section 7 of the current BI 905711 investigator’s brochure).

patients experienced Grade 1-2 infusion-related reaction (IRR).
The safety data will be closely monitored throughout this trial, and a Data Review Committee 
(DRC) will be implemented for this purpose.

clinical relevance
for this trialSummary of data, rationale for the risk Mitigation strategy
Investigational Medicinal Product: BI 905711
The anticipated AEs based on the BI 905711 mode of action, pharmacological data and results of preclinical 
toxicology studies are described below; For more details, refer to the IB ( c16856466 ).
Injury of GI 
tissues expressing CDH17BI 905711 may potentially cross-link 
TRAILR2 to CDH17 in GI tissues and induce apoptosis and injury. No signs of GI injury were observed in preclinical 
toxicology studies in cynomolgus monkeys 
up to the highest administered dose. In-vitro data suggest that normal human colon epithelial cells are insensitive to TRAILR2 induced apoptosis, but their sensitivity can 
be increased during inflammation or viral 
infection ( R16-4563 , R17-2592 ). Based on 
above considerations, possible anticipated 
AEs of BI 905711 may include nausea, anorexia, diarrhea, vomiting, pancreatitis, increase in pancreatic amylase, abdominal 
pain and/or other GI tract related 
signs/symptoms.Patients with inflammatory bowel 
disease or bowel infection, or history of chronic pancreatitis should not participate in clinical trials with BI 
905711. Guidelines for management of 
nausea, diarrhea and vomiting is provided in Section 4.2.4.3 .

relevance for 
this trialSummary of data, rationale for the risk Mitigation strategy
Drug-induced 
liver injuryLiver tissue is reported as the most sensitive 
non-cancerous tissue to TRAILR2 mediated apoptosis ( R16-1795 , R16-1793 ). Human 
hepatocytes do not express CDH17 and in 
Hep G2 cells used as a surrogate for TRAIL 
sensitive hepatocytes, no significant effect 
of BI 905711 on cell viability was observed. However, liver damage cannot be excluded particularly in patients with liver metastases. Timely detection, evaluation, and 
follow-up of alterations in selected liver laboratory parameters to ensure patients´safety will be implemented.
Renal Injury A 6-week GLP toxicology study in monkeys 
showed glomerulopathy at the highest tested dose of 100 mg/kg. These finding were not accompanied by clinical or biochemical 
changes in renal function. There was no 
proteinuria and no increase in serum creatinine or blood urea nitrogen (BUN). The relevance of these renal findings 
for humans is unknown. Patients will be monitored for changes in renal functions by routine measurement of 
creatinine and urea in blood and 
protein in urine. See section 4.2.4.6
Infusion-related 
reaction (IRR)As with any mAb, hypersensitivity reactions 
with BI 905711 are possible. BI 905711 is a humanized bi-specific antibody with atypical format which may induce IRR via multiple 
mechanisms. Recent data with a bi-specific 
antibody targeting TRAILR2 and FAP, and a TRAILR1/R2 agonist (ABBV-261) reported an incidence of 9% and 8% of grade 1-2 infusion reactions respectively but no grade ≥3 (R18-1695 , R20-0970 ).Patients with a known hypersensitivity 
to the trial medications or their excipients are excluded.
Management guidelines for IRR are 
provided in Section 4.2.4.1
Cytokine release 
syndrome (CRS) 
and immune-mediated reactionsCRS is a supra-physiologic response 
resulting in the activation or engagement of 
T cells and / or other immune effector cells, which can be serious or life-threatening. The TRAIL pathway has been implicated in inflammation, in some preclinical experiments, but the clinical relevance of 
these findings is unknown ( R18-2770 ). BI 
905711 did not induce any cytokine release 
using a standard in vitro assay ( c16856466 ). 
There was no CRS reported in historical 
studies with conventional TRAILR2 
agonists ( R16-1793 , R16-1794 , R17-2590 , 
R17-2600 , R17-2601 , R16-4524 , R17-
2606 ).The risk of CRS cannot be excluded, 
and patients should be followed for 
possible occurrence of CRS. Guidelines are provided in Section 4.2.4.2

Tumor Lysis 
Syndrome (TLS)BI 905711 induces apoptosis within a short 
time frame in-vitro and leads to tumor 
regression in-vivo in preclinical models. Theoretically, TLS can occur.Patients should be monitored for 
occurrence of TLS particularly after 
the first administration of BI 905711. Guidelines are provided in Section 4.2.4.4
Neurological adverse eventsA six-week GLP toxicology study in 
monkeys showed minimal to mild perivascular eosinophilic/monocyte cell 
infiltrations in brain and spine at doses of 
30mg/kg and 100mg/kg with no apparent clinical neurological finding in affected animals. More details are described in section 1.2and the IB (c16856466)Relevance of these findings for 
humans is unknown. Human exposure to the highest planned dose of 4.8 
mg/kg is estimated to be 3 to 4-fold 
below exposure in monkeys at the 30 mg/kg (NOAEL). CDH17 is an epithelial protein and it is not expressed in brain tissue. No neurological AE related to BI 905711 
have been observed in preclinical 
studies and in ongoing FIH phase I trial. Thus, BI905711 is not expected to induce neurological adverse events.Patients who develop new 
neurological symptoms or deficits 
need to undergo neurological investigations including a brain MRI, and treatment with BI 905711 must be interrupted or discontinued. Guidelines for management of potential 
neurological toxicities are provided in 
Section 4.2.4.5 and their relationship 
to ADA will be assessed in this trial.
ADA (anti-drug 
antibodies) related adverse reactionsADA to BI 905711 were observed in 
monkeys and were considered an immune response to a humanized monoclonal antibody. The presence of ADA in monkeys 
is not indicative of a similar response in 
humans (c16856466). BI 905711 may lead 
to development of ADA in humans, and its occurrence will be explored in this study (see Section 5.3.2 ). The consequence of 
ADA on safety is currently unknown, 
however there is a single preclinical report 
indicating the possibility of ADA-mediated clustering of TRAILR2 and its potential contribution to liver injury ( R17-2603 ).Patients will be followed for 
development of liver injury, and possible contribution of ADA to liver injury will be assessed.

infectionDue to the underlying disease, exposure 
to intensive anti-cancer treatments 
and/or immunosuppressive therapies, patients in this trial may be immuno-compromised and at higher risk for infection and/or severe illness from COVID-19.A Benefit-Risk assessment in the context 
of the COVID-19 pandemic for patients 
treated with BI 905711 has been performed. Based on its mode of action, BI 905711 is not expected to have a relevant impact on the susceptibility to or 
the course of a COVID-19 infection. In 
case of a confirmed infection, continued use of trial treatment will be left to the investigator’s benefit-risk assessment on a case-by-case basis. Withdrawing treatment in a cancer patient who may 
have few or no alternative treatment 
options requires a careful, individual evaluation.
Trial procedures
Tumor Biopsy There is an added risk for pain, swelling, 
bleeding for those patients who will 
undergo tumor biopsies. As the results from the biopsy will provide more information which will assist clinical 
decisions for future patients, the benefit 
is assumed to outweigh the risks.Biopsies will only be performed when 
deemed safe by the investigator and if the platelet count is sufficient to allow for haemostasis.
Background therapy
Irinotecan, Leucovorin, Fluorouracil, BevacizumabRefer to the most recent approved local 
labels.The investigator must review the label for 
each background therapy and implement any additional required safety monitoring to reduce the risk to the patient.
1.4.3 Discussion
There may be a potential benefit, eg. improved disease control and survival while 
maintaining quality of life, to patients from the addition of BI 905711 to FOLFIRI (or Liposomal Irinotecan plus 5-FU/Leucovorin) in pancreatic cancer, or to FOLFIRI plus bevacizumab in CRC.
The first in human (FIH) Phase I study of BI 905711 (1412-0001) currently being conducted 
in Asia, Europe and USA, is investigating the recommended phase 2 dose, safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics, and preliminary efficacy of BI 905711 as monotherapy in patients with advanced or metastatic GI cancers. At the initiation of trial 1412-0003, the FIH monotherapy study 1412-0001 will be still ongoing, and the available preliminary safety data in monotherapy will serve as a reference for the starting and

The DRC will assess trial data to ensure the overall safety of enrolled patients. The DRC will 
also provide the investigators and the Sponsor with advice about the overall conduct of the trial (refer to Section 8.7).
The Sponsor will continuously assess the risks and benefits based on accumulating data from 
all clinical trials with BI 905711. Any significant change in risk-benefit ratio will be communicated to investigators and patients. 
In summary, this trial will implement multiple safety measures to mitigate possible risks for 
participating patients. It is assumed that participation in this study and treatment with BI 905711 in combination with the background treatment may potentially provide patients with clinical benefit at an acceptable risk.

001-MCS-40-106_RD -03 (19.0) / Saved on: 05 Nov 20203.1.1 Dose escalation phase (Phase Ia)
Phase Ia is an open-label, non-randomized dose escalation study of BI 905711 in combination 
with FOLFIRI and bevacizumab in patients with CRC. Refer to Figure 3.1: 1 . The objective 
of the phase Ia is to determine the MTD/RDE.
A Bayesian logistic regression model (BLRM) with overdose control ( R13-4803 ) will be 
used to determine the MTD. The BLRM estimates the MTD by updating the probability of 
observing a DLT for each dose level in each dose escalation cohort. At any time during the trial, it will not be permitted to escalate to a dose which does not fulfil the escalation with overdose control (EWOC) criterion.
The MTD evaluation period is defined as a two 14-day treatment cycle (from cycle 1 
Day 1 until the day before cycle 3 Day 1, or end of the REP in case of discontinuation before start of cycle 3).
Patients will receive increasing doses of BI 905711 in combination with FOLFIRI plus 
bevacizumab until either the MTD or the RDE in the absence of MTD, is reached. 
Incremental dose increases of BI 905711 in successive patient cohorts will be no more than 100% of the previous dose level. 
At each dose level, all patient cohorts will include at least 3 patients. In the case that only 2 
out of 3 patients in a cohort are evaluable and neither has experienced a DLT within the MTD evaluation period, dose-escalation can occur based on the data from these 2 patients. 
As soon as all patients at a dose level have either experienced a DLT or have completed the 
MTD evaluation period without experiencing a DLT, a BLRM with overdose control will be re-run with the newly accumulated data. Based on the estimates from the model and on additional information (i.e. PK and PD as available), the DRC will reach a joint recommendation of the next dose level to be investigated, the size of the next cohort, as well as the potential recommendation to expand the size of the recruiting cohort.
If DLTs are observed in the first two consecutive patients of a previously untested dose level, 
subsequent enrolment to this dose cohort will be stopped. The BLRM will be re-run to confirm whether the dose level still fulfils the EWOC criterion. Based on this information, the DRC will evaluate whether the next patients will be enrolled at the same dose level or at a lower dose level including intermediate dose levels.
No further dose escalation will take place after the criterion for MTD is fulfilled. Further 
patients may be included to confirm this MTD estimate, i.e. to confirm that the EWOC criterion is still fulfilled. The DRC can declare any dose fulfilling the EWOC criterion as the RDE, independent of the MTD estimate. The RDE will not exceed the MTD. Any DLTs occurring after the MTD evaluation period will be considered for the evaluation of the RDE.If no DLT is observed, the DRC may decide to declare the RDE based on PK/PD and efficacy endpoints, and overall safety profile.

001-MCS-40-106_RD -03 (19.0) / Saved on: 05 Nov 20203.1.2 Dose expansion phase (Phase Ib)
Phase Ib is an open label study with the main objective to assess the safety and efficacy of BI 
905711 in combination with chemotherapy (with or without bevacizumab) in 2 expansion cohorts. PK will be further characterised and the RP2D will be determined.
Phase Ib will consist of 2 cohorts of patients with 2 different tumor types as described below. 
Refer to Figure 3.1: 1 for the planned randomized CRC cohort and single arm PDAC cohort.
3.1.2.1 Randomized CRC expansion cohort
This is an open label, randomized cohort of approximately 60 CRC patients. Patients will be 
randomized in a 2:1 ratio into either:• Arm A = BI 905711 (at the RDE from Phase Ia) plus FOLFIRI and bevacizumab 
or
• Arm B = FOLFIRI plus bevacizumab 
3.1.2.2 Single Arm PDAC expansion cohortThis is an open label single arm cohort of approximately 20 patients with CDH17-positive 
PDAC. 
A safety run-in will be included in which the first 6 patients will be treated with BI 905711 (at the RDE from Phase Ia) plus FOLFIRI (or Liposomal Irinotecan plus 5-FU/Leucovorin), to confirm the RDE based on DLTs assessed during the MTD evaluation period as defined for the Phase Ia, prior to enrolling further patients.
3.1.3 Enrolment stopping rules
All safety information will be carefully analysed by the sponsor. Enrolment will be 
temporarily stopped if a clinically relevant AE occurs which meets both of the following criteria: 
∀associated with evidence suggesting a reasonable possibility that the investigational 
drug caused the AE
∀occurs at a frequency or with severity that suggest that the risk-benefit profile of the 
investigational drug should be reassessed 
If the DRC determine that the above criteria are met, the enrolment to the trial will be 
temporarily stopped to allow for in-depth analysis of the safety profile of BI 905711 plus the applicable background treatment. The benefit-risk profile will be re-assessed by the DRC to determine if the trial should be continued as planned, or permanently discontinued or will continue with modification to the trial protocol. The purpose of any modifications to the protocol will be to mitigate patient-risk and ensure that the benefit-risk assessment for continued investigation of BI 905711 plus applicable background treatment remains positive. The DRC will also consider and provide guidance for the management of patients who are already receiving study treatment. The outcome of the analysis and the recommendations will

001-MCS-40-106_RD -03 (19.0) / Saved on: 05 Nov 2020be shared with all involved Health Authorities prior to a planned re-start of enrolment. In case 
the benefit-risk assessment is no longer considered positive, the trial will be discontinued.
3.2 DISCUSSION OF TRIAL DESIGN, INCLUDING THE CHOICE OF 
CONTROL GROUP(S)
FOLFIRI in combination with Bevacizumab is indicated for first- and second-line treatment 
of CRC, including those who have progressed on a first-line bevacizumab-containing regimen. FOLFIRI (or Liposomal Irinotecan plus 5-FU/Leucovorin) is a second-line treatment option for patients with PDAC.
In Phase Ia, the selection of dose levels and patient cohort size will be guided by a BLRM 
with overdose control. An EWOC design will increase the chance of treating patients at efficacious doses while reducing the risk of overdosing. This design is based on practical experience and is an efficient method due to its ability to identify the dose with a desired toxicity rate and its allocation of a greater proportion of patients to doses at, or close to, that desired dose ( R13-4802 , R13-4804 , R13-4805 ). The use of BLRM for Phase I trials has also
been advocated by the EMA guideline on small populations ( R07-4856 ) and by the FDA 
(R13-4881 ).
3.3 SELECTION OF TRIAL POPULATION
This is an international multi-center trial.
For phase Ia (dose escalation) approximately 20 patients are planned to be entered at 
approximately 4-5 sites. The total number of patients will depend on the number of dose levels to be tested and the size of the dose escalation cohorts. 
For phase Ib, approximately 80 patients are planned to be entered at sites that participate in 
the dose escalation part of the study as well as additional sites that will be initiated as needed to fulfill the planned enrolment. If participating sites are unable to recruit patients, additional sites may be opened, and under-performing sites may be closed.
Screening of patients for this trial is competitive, however in Phase Ia, recruitment slots will 
be assigned by the Sponsor. Screening for the trial will stop at all sites at the same time once a sufficient number of patients has been screened. Investigators will be notified about screening completion and will then not be allowed to screen additional patients for this trial.Any patients already in screening at the time of screening completion, will be allowed to continue to receive treatment if eligible.
A log of all patients enrolled into the trial (i.e. who have signed informed consent) will be 
maintained in the Investigator Site File (ISF) irrespective of whether they have been treated or not.If retrospectively it is found that a patient has been entered in error (=did not meet all inclusion criteria or met one or more exclusion criteria), the sponsor or delegate should be contacted immediately. Based on an individual benefit-risk assessment a decision will be made whether continued trial participation is possible or not.

4.1.3 Selection of doses in the trial and dose modifications
A dose of 0.6 mg/kg of BI 905711 was selected as a starting dose for this combination trial 
because this dose level as well as the next dose level (i.e. 1.2 mg/kg) were considered safe and well tolerated (i.e. no observed DLTs or AEs of CTCAE grade >1) as assessed in the monotherapy dose escalation trial 1412-0001 in 4 patients each with CRC (data on file).
The dose of BI 905711 will be escalated in patient cohorts at the provisional dose levels (as 
shown in Table 4.1.3: 1 ) until the MTD or the monotherapy recommended dose (as 
established in trial 1412-0001) is reached. The dose level tested will never exceed the highest 
dose level deemed safe by the DRC in the monotherapy trial 1412-0001.
BI 905711 dose levels may be escalated up to 4.8 mg/kg which is based upon the 
pharmacodynamic modeling. Based on the available safety data and statistical model evaluation, exploration of doses higher than 4.8 mg/kg and up to 9 mg/kg, may be considered. The selection of the dose levels higher than 4.8 mg/kg that may be tested will be

meetings, the clinical course including all safety information, PK and pharmacodynamics biomarker data as available, for each patient in the current dose cohort, will be described. Updated safety data on other ongoing patients, including data beyond the MTD evaluation period, will be discussed as well. Based on the data, a decision on the next dose level of BI 905711 is made. Incremental dose increases in successive cohorts will be no more than 100%of the previous dose level.
Dose escalation will continue until identification of the MTD or recommended dose for 
expansion (RDE) in case no MTD is established, or safety concerns arise, or the trial is terminated for other reasons.

001-MCS-40-106_RD -03 (19.0) / Saved on: 05 Nov 20204.1.4 Method of assigning patients to treatment groups
Recruitment into the trial will be conducted in a controlled manner. Patient numbers will be 
assigned via Interactive Response Technology (IRT) upon registration of screening. 
In both phase Ia and Phase Ib, each eligible patient will be assigned and receive the 
appropriate dose for their assigned cohort.
In both phases, BI 905711 will be assigned via IRT. Each medication vial will have a unique 
medication number. The medication number assigned will be documented in the CRF. Note that the medication number is different from the patient number (the latter is generated during screening via the IRT System).
For phase Ib, patients in the CRC expansion cohort, will be randomized via IRT into one of 2 
arms; (BI 905711 + FOLFIRI +Bevacizumab arm) or (FOLFIRI +Bevacizumab arm) with 2:1 randomization ratio. The dose level of BI 905711 is determined at phase 1a. 
4.1.5 Drug assignment and administration of doses for each patient
BI 905711 will be prepared and handled according to the 1412-0003 ‘Preparation and 
Handling Instructions” which will be filed in the ISF. Each patient will receive the appropriate trial medication and dose for their assigned dose cohort.
IMP (BI 905711 and background therapy for Phase Ib CRC cohort, if considered as IMP per 
local regulations )will be assigned via IRT for each treatment cycle. Upon notification that a 
patient will be treated in the study, the pharmacy will prepare the trial medication at the 
assigned dosage for administration to the patient.
The Cycle 1 Day 3 dose of BI 905711 will be calculated using the Cycle 1 Day 1 weight or 
up to 3 days prior as the reference weight. If the patient’s weight changes by ≤10% compared 
to the reference weight, the dose (in mg) may remain the same for subsequent cycles. If the weight changes by >10% the dose will be recalculated and the new weight will be used as the reference weight.
All IMP as well as background treatment will be given as an intra-venous infusion by 
authorised site staff in a specialised unit where emergency care can be provided. Appropriate drugs and medical equipment to treat anaphylactic reactions must be immediately available, and study personnel must be trained to recognise and treat anaphylaxis. 
No routine premedication will be required for BI 905711 i.v. infusions. (refer to Section 
4.2.2.1 ). Refer to section 4.2.2.1 for premedication for background therapy.
The BI 905711 i.v. infusion should take place over 30 minutes (+/-10 minutes), unless there 
is a necessity of administration rate reduction according to the protocol (e.g., in case of infusion-related reaction). If a patient’s weight is ≤50 kg, the infusion duration may be less 
than 30 minutes depending upon the infusion rate and the patient’s condition.

001-MCS-40-106_RD -03 (19.0) / Saved on: 05 Nov 2020Priming and flushing should not be included in the administration duration. Total storage 
time for ready-to-use solution at room temperature should not exceed 150 minutes between preparation and end of infusion time. 
Observation period for CRS/IRR
∀Patients will remain under surveillance for at least 6 hours after the end of infusion after 
the first, second and third administrations of BI 905711. During the post-infusion observation period, body temperature, pulse rate and blood pressure will be measured at the end of the infusion and every 2 hours (± 15 minutes) thereafter.
∀If no adverse signs or symptoms, e.g. infusion-related reactions, are observed during the 
first 3 administrations, the duration of the post-infusion observation period may be reduced to 4 hours for subsequent administrations. Body temperature, pulse rate and blood pressure will be measured at the end of the infusion, then after 2 and 4 hours (± 15 minutes).
∀After 6 administrations in the absence of infusion-related reactions, the post-infusion 
observation period can be reduced to 2 hours at investigator’s discretion. Body temperature, pulse rate and blood pressure will be measured at the end of the infusion, then after 2 hours (± 15 minutes). 
4.1.5.1 Administration of FOLFIRI with or without bevacizumab
Background therapy FOLFIRI (or Liposomal Irinotecan plus 5-FU/Leucovorin) in patients 
with PDAC and FOLFIRI in combination with bevacizumab in patients with CRC will be administered in accordance to respective NCCN Guidelines ( R21-2007 , R21-2008 ).
See Section 4.2for background treatment for dose escalation (Phase Ia) and dose expansion 
(Phase Ib).
4.1.5.2 Criteria for receiving further treatment
Eligibility for further treatment should be confirmed prior to dosing on Day 1 of each cycle
(and on Day 3 prior to administration of BI 905711 for clinical criteria only) by confirming the patient has not met any criteria for protocol discontinuation as described in section 3.3.4.1
and absence of any adverse event requiring treatment discontinuation (section 4.2.3 ).
To continue treatment the following criteria must be met:
∀Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1.5 x 109/L, ≥ 1.5 x 103/μL, or ≥ 1500/mm3
∀Platelets ≥ 75 x 109/L, ≥ 75 x 103/μL, or ≥ 75000/mm3
∀Adequate renal function: for bevacizumab, proteinuria should be monitored per local 
site practice.

continue treatment beyond progression due to clinical benefit and after agreementwith Sponsor).
If the criteria are not met but the patient is recovering, the patient should continue to be 
assessed regularly and the next dose of treatment may be delayed for up to 28 days until the criteria are met. Dose modification may be appropriate (see Section 4.1.5.3 ).
4.1.5.3 Dose modifications
Individual patients must not receive a higher dose than assigned to them at the start of the 
trial. Dose escalation is allowed in cases where the dose has been reduced in error. At the time the recommended doses for expansion are determined by DRC, patients that are on any other dose levels may be adapted to the recommended dose at investigator's discretion. The dose cannot be escalated if the dose has been previously reduced for toxicity reason.
Dose modification of BI 905711 and FOLFIRI (or Liposomal Irinotecan plus 5-
FU/Leucovorin (PDAC only)) regimen should be based on the worst preceding toxicity. Dose adjustment should not be considered for bevacizumab and leucovorin.
Subsequent doses should be adjusted as suggested in Table 4.1.5.3:1.

Erythropoietic therapy is allowed when used in accordance with the American Society of 
Clinical Oncology/American Society of Hematology or the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines. In Japan, erythropoietic therapy is not approved for anemia caused by cancer chemotherapies.
COVID-19 Vaccination and other preventive measures
The decision on COVID-19 vaccination of a BI study patient must be taken based on an 
individual Benefit-Risk Assessment by the investigator after thorough discussion with the patient. This assessment should consider the approved labels of the respective vaccines as well as the provisions given in the protocol, including the time point when the vaccination should be given or a potential delay of the vaccination or of the study treatment.
The package insert for approved COVID-19 vaccinations should be carefully reviewed for 
local guidance considering acute moderate/severe febrile illness, and the risk of an anaphylactic reaction to the vaccine. Furthermore, the diminished response to the vaccine needs to be considered for immunocompromised conditions which may be observed in BI 905711 treated patients.
It is important to encourage to continue taking precautions such as wearing a mask, 
maintaining social distancing and washing hands frequently, even after a patient receives a COVID-19 vaccine. These precautions will be necessary until public health experts advise otherwise.

ovulation (oral [approved in Japan], intravaginal [unapproved in Japan], transdermal [unapproved in Japan]).
∀Progestogen-only hormonal birth control that prevents ovulation (oral, injectable, 
implantable) [unapproved in Japan].
∀Intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine hormone-releasing system (IUS).
∀Bilateral tubal occlusion
OrPatients must abstain from male-female sex. This is defined as being in line with the 
preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. Periodic abstinence e.g. calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods; declaration of abstinence for the duration of exposure to study drug; and withdrawal are not acceptable.
Breast feeding should be interrupted from the start of study treatment through 6 month after 
the last study treatment
4.2.4 Dose modification and management of adverse events
4.2.4.1 Management of infusion-related reactions
Infusion-related reactions (IRR) involve the immune system; however, they can have 
different mechanisms. Some are allergic in nature and are usually mediated by immunoglobulin E while others are not classical allergic reactions (so-called anaphylactoid reactions e.g. caused by cytokine release). Although infusional reactions can be allergic or nonallergic, clinical symptoms are difficult to distinguish and require rapid assessment and immediate management to avoid severe adverse events, including fatality.
If an infusion-related reaction of ≥ CTCAE Grade 3 occurs, trial treatment must be 
permanently discontinued.

001-MCS-40-106_RD -03 (19.0) / Saved on: 05 Nov 2020If symptoms of an infusion-related reaction of CTCAE Grade 2 occur, which do not qualify 
as DLT according to Section 5.2.7 the infusion should be temporarily stopped. Institute 
medical management (e.g. glucocorticoids, epinephrine, bronchodilators, or oxygen) for 
infusion reactions as needed. Upon recovery, the following guidance must be followed.
∀If at least 50% of the planned dose of BI 905711 was administered, no further BI 
905711 will be administered until the next scheduled dose.
∀If less than 50% of the planned dose of BI 905711 was administered due to an 
infusion-related reaction, a further dose of 50% of the intended total dose may be administered on the following day and after recovery to baseline for at least 24 hours. Administration may occur within up to 2 days after the original planned dose (Subsequent treatments, FOLFIRI+bevacizumab + BI905711 or FOLFIRI (or Liposomal Irinotecan plus 5-FU/Leucovorin) + BI 905711 should be also delayed so that the interval between BI 905711 is 14 days). Refer to Appendix 10.2 for 
details regarding PK collection. Remaining solution from the original dose must 
be discarded, and a new kit must be dispensed to prepare the dose of 50% of the intended total dose. 
∀During the first re-exposure, patients must remain under observation for at least 6
hours post start of infusion. If required, patients may be hospitalised for a longer observation period at the investigator’s discretion.
∀Premedication must be used for all subsequent treatment infusions. The 
recommended premedication is:
oAcetaminophen/Paracetamol 650 mg - 1000 mg p.o., or equivalent
oAntihistamine p.o. or i.v., equivalent to Diphenhydramine 50 mg i.v.
oGlucocorticoid i.v., equivalent to prednisolone 50-100 mg 
∀The infusion rate for further treatment cycles may be adapted according to 
Investigator decision, but any adaption of the infusion rate must be agreed with the sponsor. Total storage time for ready-to-use solution at room temperature should not exceed 150 minutes between preparation and end of infusion time. See section 4.1.5
If infusion reactions and/or hypersensitivity reactions occur in a substantial proportion oftreated patients without premedication, the DRC may decide that all future patients treated in the trial must receive premedication (as described above) prior to BI 905711 infusion; the dosage and schedule of premedication will be aligned and will take into account any local clinical standards. Such a decision will be communicated to all investigators in writing.Premedications should be recorded in the eCRF.
For bevacizumab refer to table 4.1.5.3.3 for guidance in case of infusion reactions and/or 
hypersensitivity reactions.
For irinotecan, liposomal irinotecan and 5-FU refer to local approved label for guidance in case of infusion reactions and/or hypersensitivity reactions.

001-MCS-40-106_RD -03 (19.0) / Saved on: 05 Nov 20204.2.4.2 Management of CRS, other IRRs and events with similar signs/symptoms
CRS is a supra-physiologic response following any therapy that results in the activation or 
engagement of endogenous or infused T cells and/or other immune effector cells. Symptoms can be progressive, include fever at the onset, and may include hypotension, hypoxia, capillary leak syndrome and end organ dysfunction. Other signs/symptoms of CRS can be e.g. tachypnea, headache, tachycardia, rash, nausea, vomiting, increased transaminases, and increased bilirubin. CRS can be serious or life threatening.
CRS signs/symptoms may occur quickly during or after administration, or after several hours 
or days. Occurrence of such signs/symptoms temporally related to administration of trial medication, requires immediate management and rapid diagnosis to avoid severe complications.
The manifestations of CRS overlap with those of other types of IRRs, infection, capillary leak 
syndrome and haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis/macrophage activation syndrome (HLH/MAS). IRRs can be allergic or non-allergic (due to release of histamine or cytokines, 
respectively). Mixed type reactions may occur. CRS, other IRRs and events with similar 
signs/symptoms are difficult to distinguish.
Patients must remain under observation for potential signs and symptoms of CRS (e.g. 
hypotension, rash, tachypnea, hypoxia, tachycardia, fever, nausea, fatigue, headache, myalgias and malaise) for at least 6 hours following the end of infusion of BI 905711. If no signs or symptoms of CRS are observed during the first 3 administrations, the duration of observation may be reduced to 4 hours for subsequent administrations. After 6 administrations, in the absence of potential signs and symptoms of CRS, the observation period can be reduced to 2 hours at investigator’s discretion. During all post infusion observation periods, body temperature, pulse rate and blood pressure must be monitored as described in section 4.1.5 .
In case of CRS, other IRRs or events with similar signs/symptoms, appropriate measures 
depending on the type and severity of the reaction should be taken by the investigator according to international standards ( R19-0311 , R20-2020 ), best medical judgement, and 
local guidelines. Supportive therapy including antipyretics, intravenous fluids, and low dose 
vasopressors may be used. In patients who do not respond to these treatments, corticosteroids and/or interleukin 6 receptor antagonists ( R15-0031 , R18-1685 , R18-1686 ) may be required 
and patients should be monitored closely, preferably in an intensive care unit.
In the event of CTCAE ≥ Grade 3 CRS, study treatment must be permanently discontinued. 
In the event of CTCAE Grade 2 CRS, the guidance for handling a CTCAE Grade 2 infusion-related reaction must be followed (Section 4.2.4.1 ).
Appropriate drugs and medical equipment to treat CRS, other IRRs and events with similar 
signs/symptoms must be immediately available, and trial personnel must be trained to recognise and treat such events. The trial site must have immediate access to emergency resuscitation teams and equipment in addition to the ability to admit patients to an intensive care unit, if necessary.

The occurrence, severity and duration of diarrhea, vomiting and nausea, and the outcomes of 
these events will be documented in detail in the eCRF. Further tests and examinations e.g. colonoscopy, gastroscopy should be performed according to the severity of the symptoms in order to document and obtain more information about the extent of possible injury due to BI 905711. If severe injury to GI tissues is excluded, these events could be managed symptomatically according to Tables 4.2.4.3: 1 and 4.2.4.3: 2 .

4.2.4.4 Tumor lysis syndrome
All patients have to be assessed for clinical or laboratory suspicion of tumor lysis syndrome. 
To prevent tumor lysis syndrome, patients should remain appropriately hydrated throughout the administration period. For details of laboratory assessment, refer to Section 5.2.3 . In case 
tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) is observed, patients should be managed according to local or 
available guidelines ( R10-4517 ).

001-MCS-40-106_RD -03 (19.0) / Saved on: 05 Nov 20204.2.4.5 Neurological adverse events
Toxicology studies in cynomolgus monkeys showed that BI 905711 at high doses induced 
minimal to mild monocytic/eosinophilic cells infiltrates in CNS ( c16856466 ). Clinical 
significance of these findings for humans is currently unknown. Human exposure to the 
highest planned dose of 4.8 mg/kg is estimated to be 3 to 4-fold below exposure in monkeys at the 30 mg/kg. As CDH17 is not expressed in brain tissue, BI905711 is not expected to induce neurological adverse events. No neurological AE related to BI905711 or background therapy have been observed so far. Patients shall be monitored for possible neurological toxicity. Patients who develop worsening or new neurological signs/symptoms CTCAE grade ≥ 2 should undergo full neurological investigation including a brain MRI. Treatment 
with BI 905711 must be interrupted or permanently discontinued unless alternative etiology is documented e.g. new metastases in the CNS, metabolic disturbances, sepsis, infection, hypoxia, tumor lysis syndrome, trauma, adverse effect of concomitant medications. Additional workup may be performed if clinically indicated e.g. lumbar puncture.
4.2.4.6 Renal adverse eventsToxicology studies in cynomolgus monkeys showed that BI 905711 at high doses induced 
minimal to mild glomerulopathy with no proteinuria or increase of serum creatinine and urea 
(c16856466 ). Clinical significance of these findings for humans is currently unknown. 
Patients will be followed periodically for kidney function by measurement of serum 
creatinine and a qualitative urine protein. Patients with a 2+ or greater protein reading on a urine dipstick should be followed by a 24 hour urine collection for a quantitative protein.Patients with proteinuria ≥ CTCAE grade 3 (>3.5 g/24 hours) should interrupt BI 905711. 
Continuation of treatment with BI 905711 at a reduced dose may be considered if proteinuria recovers to ≤ grade 1 within 3 weeks.
Patients receiving bevacizumab should suspend administration for urine protein levels ≥2
g/24 hours and resume when proteinuria is <2 gm/24 hours. Bevacizumab must be permanently discontinued in patients with nephrotic syndrome.
4.3 TREATMENT COMPLIANCE
BI 905711 and background therapy will be administered as an intravenous infusion at the 
clinical site under the supervision of trained site personnel. Therefore, actual dosing is expected to follow the protocol. The doses administered will be recorded in the eCRF and any irregularities in dosing will also be documented in the eCRF by the investigator or designee.

5.1 ASSESSMENT OF EFFICACY
Tumor response and progression will be evaluated by investigator review in this study 
according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) guideline (Version 1.1) (R09-0262 ).
Tumor assessment will be performed per institutional practice. Only the overall response and 
disease progression will be collected in the eCRF. 
Tumor assessments should include computed tomography (CT) scans or MRI of chest, 
abdomen, and pelvis. If clinically indicated, imaging of any other known or suspected sites of disease (e.g. brain, bone) should be performed. 
5.2 ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY
Safety will mainly be evaluated by severity and incidence of AEs, graded according to 
National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 5.0 ( R18-1357 ). Criteria for DLT are described in Section 5.2.7 .
5.2.1 Physical examination
A complete physical examination will be performed as per institutional practice. It includes at 
a minimum general appearance, neck, lungs, cardiovascular system, abdomen, extremities, and skin.Measurement of height (cm) and body weight (kg) and the evaluation of ECOG performance score will be performed at the time points specified in the flowchart .
The results must be included in the source documents available at the site. 
5.2.1.1 Body WeightBody weight measurements should be done on the same scale for each patient. In order to get 
comparable body weight valu es, body weight  measurements should be performed per the 
following:• shoes and coat/jackets should be taken off• pockets should be emptied of heavy objects (i.e. keys, coins etc)
5.2.2 Vital signs
Vital signs will be evaluated as per institutional practice, prior to blood sampling.
This includes systolic and diastolic blood pressure, body temperature and pulse rate (electronically or by palpation count for 1 minute) in a seated position after 2 minutes of rest. The results must be included in the source documents available at the site.

Safety laboratory parameters to be assessed are listed in Table 5.2.3: 1 and will be performed 
by a local laboratory as per institutional practice
The site will file the respective reference ranges in the ISF. 
Patients do not have to be fasted for the blood sampling for the safety laboratory. It is the responsibility of the investigator to evaluate the laboratory reports. Clinically relevant 
abnormal findings as judged by the investigator will be reported as adverse events (please refer to section 5.2.6 ).
In case a treatment course is delayed due to an adverse event, the patient should visit the site 
at least once a week for assessment of safety laboratory and adverse events. More frequent visits may be appropriate as assessed by the investigator.
Additional parameters may be measured if they are part of the standard panel of the 
institution laboratory. The sponsor and investigator may discuss and agree that individual 
parameters will not be measured if they are not part of the standard panel of the institution 
laboratory. The investigator should complete additional evaluations of laboratory tests as clinically indicated. Any abnormal and clinically relevant finding from these investigations will be reported as an Adverse Event.
In case the criteria for hepatic injury are fulfilled, a number of additional measures will be 
performed (please see Section 5.2.6.1.4 and the DILI Checklist provided in the eDC system
and ISF. The amount of blood taken from the patient concerned will be increased due to this 
additional sampling.

5.2.6 Assessment of adverse events
5.2.6.1 Definitions of AEs 
5.2.6.1.1 Adverse eventAn AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation 
subject administered a medicinal product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment.
An AE can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether considered related or not.
The following should also be recorded as an AE in the CRF and BI SAE form (if applicable):
∀Worsening of the underlying disease if certain conditions are met – refer to section 
5.2.6.2.4
∀Worsening of pre-existing conditions other than the underlying disease.
∀Changes in vital signs, ECG, physical examination and laboratory test results, if they 
are judged clinically relevant by the investigator.
If such abnormalities already exist prior to trial inclusion, they will be considered as baseline 
conditions and should be collected in the eCRF only.
5.2.6.1.2 Serious adverse eventA serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as any AE, which fulfils at least one of the 
following criteria:
- results in death,- is life-threatening, which refers to an event in which the patient was at risk of death at 
the time of the event; it does not refer to an event that hypothetically might have caused death if more severe,
- requires inpatient hospitalisation or prolongation of existing hospitalisation- results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity,- is a congenital anomaly / birth defect,- is deemed serious for any other reason if it is an important medical event when based 
on appropriate medical judgement which may jeopardise the patient and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the

001-MCS-40-106_RD -03 (19.0) / Saved on: 05 Nov 2020above definitions. Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency 
room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalisation or development of dependency or abuse. 
For Japan only: An event that possibly leads to disability will be handled as ‘deemed serious 
for any other reason’ and, therefore, reported as an SAE.
5.2.6.1.3 AEs considered “Always Serious”In accordance with the European Medicines Agency initiative on Important Medical Events, 
Boehringer Ingelheim has set up a list of AEs, which by their nature, can always be considered to be “serious” even though they may not have met the criteria of an SAE as defined above.The latest list of “Always Serious AEs” can be found in the eDC system. A copy of the latest list of “Always Serious AEs” will be provided upon request. These events should always be reported as SAEs as described in section 5.2.6.2 .
Every occurrence of cancer of new histology must be classified as a serious event regardless 
of the time since the discontinuation of the trial medication and must be reported as described 
in 5.2.6.2 , subsections “AE Collection” and “ AE reporting to sponsor and timelines ”.
5.2.6.1.4 Adverse events of special interest
The term adverse events of special interest (AESI) relates to any specific AE that has been 
identified at the project level as being of particular concern for prospective safety monitoring and safety assessment within this trial, e.g. the potential for AEs based on knowledge from other compounds in the same class. AESIs need to be reported to the sponsor’s Pharmacovigilance Department within the same timeframe that applies to SAEs, please see Section 5.2.6.2.2 .
The following are considered as AESIs:
Potential Severe DILI
A potential severe Drug Induced Liver Injury (DILI) that requires follow-up is defined by the 
following alterations of hepatic laboratory parameters: 
For patients with normal ALT and AST levels at baseline:
∀An elevation of AST (Aspartate Aminotransferase) and / or ALT (Alanine 
Aminotransferase) ≥3-fold ULN combined with an elevation of total bilirubin ≥2-fold 
ULN measured in the same blood sample, or in samples drawn within 30 days of each 
other, or
∀ALT and / or AST elevations ≥10-fold ULN.
For patients with abnormal aminotransaminase levels between >1 and <3 x ULN at

∀Aminotransferase elevations ≥5-fold the baseline value.
For patients with abnormal aminotransaminase levels between ≥3 x ULN and <5 x ULN 
at baseline:
∀An elevation of AST and / or ALT ≥2-fold the baseline value combined with an 
elevation of bilirubin ≥2-fold ULN or ≥2-fold the baseline value (if bilirubin is 
elevated at baseline); measured in the same blood sample or in samples drawn within 30 days of each other; or;
∀Aminotransferase elevations ≥3-fold the baseline value.
These lab findings constitute a hepatic injury alert and the patients showing these lab 
abnormalities need to be followed up according to the “DILI checklist” provided in the ISF.
In case of clinical symptoms of hepatic injury (icterus, unexplained encephalopathy, 
unexplained coagulopathy, right upper quadrant abdominal pain, etc.) without lab results (ALT, AST, total bilirubin) available, the investigator should make sure these parameters are analysed, if necessary, in an unscheduled blood test. Should the results meet the criteria of hepatic injury alert, the procedures described in the DILI checklist should be followed.

Any medical event fulfilling the criteria of DLT (see Section 5.2.7 ) should be reported as an 
AESI.
Infusion-related reactions
The following AEs, when occurring with a temporal relationship to the infusion, are 
considered as potential infusion-related reactions and should be reported as AESIs, regardless of their CTCAE grade:
• Infusion-related reaction (synonyms: infusion reactions , infusion-like reactions)
• Allergic reaction• Anaphylaxis• Cytokine-release syndrome• Any other event which the investigator considers as a potential infusion-related 
reaction.
5.2.6.1.5 Intensity (severity) of AEs
The intensity (severity) of AEs should be classified and recorded in the CRF according to the 
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 5.0(R18-1357 ).
5.2.6.1.6 Causal relationship of AEs
Medical judgement should be used to determine the relationship between the adverse event 
and the BI investigational compound, considering all relevant factors, including pattern of reaction, temporal relationship, de-challenge or re-challenge, confounding factors such as concomitant medication, concomitant diseases and relevant history. 
Arguments that may suggest that there is a reasonable possibility of a causal relationship 
could be:
∀The event is consistent with the known pharmacology of the trial drug.
∀The event is known to be caused by or attributed to the drug class.
∀A plausible time to onset of the event relative to the time of drug exposure.
∀Evidence that the event is reproducible when the drug is re-introduced.
∀No medically sound alternative aetiologies that could explain the event (e.g. pre-
existing or concomitant diseases, or co-medications).

5.2.6.2 Adverse event collection and reporting5.2.6.2.1 AE CollectionThe investigator shall maintain and keep detailed records of all AEs in the patient files.
The following must be collected and documented on the appropriate CRF(s) by the 
investigator:
• From signing the informed consent onwards until the individual patient’s EoR visit (FUP 
#1)): all AEs (non-serious and serious) and all AESIs.
• After the individual patient’s EoR visit until the individual patient’s end of trial:
cancers of new histology and exacerbations of existing cancer, all trial drug related SAEs and all trial drug related AESIs.
• After the individual patient’s end of trial: 
the investigator does not need to actively monitor the patient for new AEs but should onlyreport any occurrence of cancer of new histology and trial drug related SAEs and trial drug related AESIs of which the investigator may become aware of by any means of communication, e.g. phone call. Those AEs should be reported on the BI SAE form (see Section 5.2.6.2.2 ), but not on the CRF.
The rules for Adverse Event Reporting exemptions still apply, please see Section 5.2.6.2.4 .
5.2.6.2.2 AE reporting to the sponsor and timelines
The investigator must report SAEs, AESIs, and non-serious AEs which are relevant for the 
reported SAE or AESI, on the BI SAE form to the sponsor’s unique entry point within 24 hours of becoming aware of the event, the country specific process will be specified in the ISF. The same timeline applies if follow-up information becomes available. In specific occasions, the investigator could inform the sponsor upfront via telephone. This does not replace the requirement to complete the BI SAE form.
With receipt of any further information to these events, a follow-up SAE form has to be 
provided. For follow-up information the same rules and timeline apply as for initial information. All (S)AEs, including those persisting after individual patient’s end of trial must

further information can be obtained.
5.2.6.2.3 PregnancyIn rare cases, pregnancy might occur in a clinical trial. Once a patient has been enrolled in the 
clinical trial and has taken trial medication, the investigator must report any drug exposure during pregnancy in a trial participant immediately (within 24 hours) by means of Part A of the Pregnancy Monitoring Form to the sponsor’s unique entry point.
Similarly, potential drug exposure during pregnancy must be reported if a partner of a male 
trial participant becomes pregnant. This requires written consent of the pregnant partner.Reporting and consenting must be in line with local regulations. The ISF will contain the trial specific information and consent for the pregnant partner.
The outcome of the pregnancy associated with the drug exposure during pregnancy must be 
followed up and reported to the sponsor’s unique entry point on the Pregnancy Monitoring Form for Clinical Studies (Part B).The ISF will contain the Pregnancy Monitoring Form for Clinical Studies (Part A and B).
As pregnancy itself is not to be reported as an AE, in the absence of an accompanying SAE 
and / or AESI, only the Pregnancy Monitoring Form for Clinical Studies and not the SAE form is to be completed. If there is an SAE and / or AESI associated with the pregnancy an SAE form must be completed in addition.
5.2.6.2.4 Exemptions to AE reporting
Collection and reporting of PD
The outcome progressive disease (PD) is used to assess trial endpoints for the analysis of 
efficacy. It will be recorded on the appropriate page of the eCRF. 
If the disease progression does not meet standard seriousness criteria (see section 5.2.6.1.2 ), 
then it is exempt from AE reporting, and will only be recorded on the appropriate page of the 
eCRF. 
For example, asymptomatic disease progression detected on a routine scan would be exempt 
from AE reporting, even if disease progression is on the “always serious” list. However if there is evidence suggesting a causal relationship between the investigational drug(s) and the progression of the underlying malignancy, the event must be recorded as an SAE on the AE page in the eCRF and reported as an SAE on the SAE Form.
If disease progression meets the standard seriousness criteria (see section 5.2.6.1.2 ) it will be 
recorded on the AE page in the eCRF and on the SAE form and SAE reporting process will 
be followed.
Lab values meeting the potential severe DILI definition in section 5.2.6.1.4 must always be 
reported as AESI, even if the most likely cause is disease progression. No exemption to AE 
reporting applies.

All DLTs will be agreed upon by the DRC after review of the data from each cohort. Only DLTs occurring in the first two cycles are necessary for dose-escalation decisions made by the DRC. DLTs observed during the MTD evaluation period will be considered for MTD determination. However, all AEs and SAEs meeting criteria of DLT observed in all treatment cycles will be considered for determining a RP2D.
Replacement of patients for DLT evaluation during MTD evaluation period
For the definition of DLT, it is essential that patients are sufficiently treated according to
supportive care standards described in Section 4.1.5.1. Patients with treatable AEs (eg. 
nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea) that are not sufficiently treated do not qualify for DLT and 
need to be replaced, if this occurs in the first two Cycles. Dose escalation will be determined based on all safety information of all treated patients including those who do not complete the first two cycles for reasons other than a DLT. Criteria for replacement of patients during the MTD evaluation period is described in Section 3.3.4.1.1 .

PHARMACOKINETICS
5.3.1 Assessment of pharmacokinetics
The evaluation of BI 905711 concentrations will be performed according to BI standards and 
processes.
Pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles of BI 905711 will be investigated after the first and after
repeated doses. Standard PK parameters as listed in Appendix 10.1 will be calculated, if data 
allows and if scientifically reasonable. Noncompartmental PK parameters will be calculated 
based on actual sampling times using a validated PK software (Phoenix® WinNonlin® 6.3). 
Individual concentration data and the PK parameters calculated thereof will be tabulated and 
graphically displayed. Statistical analyses will be performed as described in Section 7.3. A 
patient’s PK data will be flagged and excluded from the statistical analyses in case of 
protocol deviations relevant to the evaluation of PK (to be decided no later than in the Blinded Report Planning Meeting) or in case of PK non-evaluability (as revealed during data 
analysis, based on internal procedures). Reasons for exclusion of a patient’s data will be 
documented in the Clinical Trial Report (CTR). PK data may be additionally analyzed using a population PK approach. If required, modelling activities will be planned and documented separately according to internal and external guidelines and SOPs.
Preliminary PK and Immunogenicity analyses can be performed as necessary e.g. as 
additional information for the DRC. In contrast to the final PK and Immunogenicity analysis, the preliminary analyses will be based on planned sampling times rather than on actual times; no supplementary patient information, e.g. on AEs or concomitant medication, will be used in these analyses, and the outputs will not be validated. Minor numerical discrepancies between preliminary and final results may therefore occur.
The presence of ADA to BI 905711 will be assessed at pre-dose and regularly during 
treatment according to the sampling scheme in Appendix 10.2
5.3.2 Methods of sample collection
Effective from CTP v4.0, PK and ADA/Nab samples are no longer collected for ongoing 
patients.
Details of the sample collection, preparation, storage and shipment are described in the 
ISF/laboratory manual.
The timepoints for collection of PK and ADA/Nab samples are given in Appendix 10.2.
Date and clock time of drug administration(s) and PK sampling will be recorded in the CRFs.Exact time points of plasma sampling will be documented in the CRFs or sent as electronic files to the Trial Data Manager.The samples may be used for further methodological investigations, (e.g. stability testing for PK, or to further characterise ADA/Nabs response or to address Health authority questions

will be generated by these additional investigations. After analysis of PK samples, leftover samples may be used to explore the effect of high mannose glycoforms on the PK of BI 905711. It is not intended to include the results from such analysis in the clinical trial report. The results may be provided in a stand-alone report.
The study samples will be discarded after completion of additional investigations including 
high mannose assessment but not later than 5 years after the final study report has been signed.
5.3.4 Pharmacokinetic - pharmacodynamic relationship
No formal analysis of a pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship is planned.
Exploratory PK/PD relationship may be investigated depending on the suitability of the data.In addition, exploratory correlation may also be made between drug concentrationand AEs. If required, modeling activities will be planned and documented separatelyaccording to internal and external guidelines and SOP.
5.4 ASSESSMENT OF BIOMARKER(S)
Effective from CTP v4.0, biomarker samples, tumor biopsies samples and [
18F]FDG-PET are 
no longer collected for ongoing patients.
This section refers to exploratory biomarkers. Established biomarkers of efficacy and safety 
are described and discussed in Sections 5.1and 5.2.
The study of biomarkers will be mostly exploratory hypothesis-generating and will be used to 
expand our understanding of the disease and trial drug. The following biomarkers are planned to be examined in this trial (for detailed sampling times, refer to Appendix 10.2 and
Flowchart ):
∀Determination of CDH17 expression (see Section 5.4.2.1 ).
∀Determination of cell death biomarkers in plasma and tumor tissue, including but not
limited to: activated caspase 3/7, at screening, baseline and on treatment as an indicator for apoptosis induction in the body (see Section 5.4.2.2 ).
∀Quantification of cell-free tumor DNA levels in patients plasma at baseline and after
treatment as an indicator for apoptotic tumor cells and tumor burden (see Section 5.4.2.3 ).
∀Measurement of gene expression in tumor biopsies taken at baseline and on treatment
addressing a potential correlation with treatment response (see Section 5.4.2.5 ).

assess tumor cell apoptosis induced by the study drug (see Section 5.4.2.6)
As medical knowledge in this field is constantly evolving, other tissue/blood biomarkers that
may become relevant e.g. as predictive markers of treatment response may also be exploredvia available tissues/blood. The list of biomarkers planned to be studied during the trial maychange based on assay validity, new information in the literature or insights from earlyanalyses.
The biomarker analyses will be performed by Boehringer Ingelheim or laboratories 
authorized by Boehringer Ingelheim.
Data obtained from the biomarker analysis will not be disclosed to patients because the
analysis is exploratory. If consent is withdrawn, all data that had already been collected up to the time of withdrawal of consent will still be used.
5.4.1 Drug interaction biomarkers
Please refer to Section 1.2
5.4.2 Pharmacodynamics and patient selection biomarkers
5.4.2.1 Determination of CDH17 protein/mRNA expression
CDH17 protein expression will be measured in an IHC assay using FFPE tumor material.
Where feasible samples will also be evaluated for CDH17 mRNA expression using appropriate technologies.
After eligibility has been confirmed, all CRC patients will be enrolled in the trial irrespective 
of CDH17 expression. Where feasible, the CDH17 expression data from all patients will be used for retrospective correlation with treatment response or clinical outcome in phase Ia and phase Ib and will help to determine a threshold for possible patients´ selection based on CDH17 expression.
For Non-CRC patients CDH17 expression will be used as part of the enrolment criteria in 
phase Ib. Only non CRC patients showing positive CDH17 expression will be entered in the trial. Where feasible, the CDH17 expression data will be used for retrospective correlation with treatment response or clinical outcome in order to refine the threshold of expression that could be used for patient selection. 
Due to science continually evolving, it may be necessary to perform additional biomarker 
assessments using tumor tissue material remaining after completion of assessments described in Section 5.4.2. Such assessments may include but are not limited to the measurement of proteins relevant to TRAILR2 engagement in the tumors.

Possible other cell death biomarkers in plasma, including but not limited to e.g. caspase-cleaved CK18 (M30) and/or total CK18 (M65) may also be measured.
5.4.2.3 Quantification of cell-free tumor DNA levels in plasmaAnalysis of cell-free DNA (cfDNA), including ctDNA (circulating tumor DNA) provides a
non-invasive technique that may help early detection of tumor response. Quantification andmutation analysis will be performed in cfDNA extracted from pre-treatment, on treatment and post-treatment plasma samples prepared from whole blood.
5.4.2.4 Immunohistochemical analysis of apoptosis induction and tumor cell 
proliferation in tumor tissue
Protein expression in tumor tissue collected pre and on treatment will be assessed by 
Immunohistochemistry in Phase Ib to indicate potential treatment effects on tumor cell apoptosis and proliferation. Protein markers to be analyzed include, but are not limited to, cleaved caspase 3 and Ki67. 
5.4.2.5 Assessment of gene expression and cancer-related gene mutation in tumor 
biopsies
Gene-expression analysis and assessment of cancer-related gene mutation will be performed 
in tumor biopsies. The purpose of this analysisis to study the biology of the tumors at baseline (prior to first treatment). If feasible data will be used for retrospective correlation with treatment response or clinical outcome in phase Ia and phase Ib. Furthermore, should on treatment samples be attained changes induced by the treatment intervention will be investigated via gene expression analysis.
Details on biopsy sample collection and shipment will be provided in the Laboratory Manual
and the ISF.
5.4.2.6 [
18F]FDG-PET/CT
To evaluate tumor cell death and apoptosis induced by BI 905711, [18F]FDG-PET/CT is
intended to be used as a sensitive non-invasive PD marker measuring drug-induced changes in metabolic activity of the tumor. [
18F]FDG-PET/CT will be performed in CRC patients in 
both phase Ia and phase Ib.
Two scans will be performed during the study; one during screening (baseline) and one on 
treatment (at the 8 week ( ±7 days) tumor assessment timepoint). The PET scan may be 
performed together with CT scan if feasible. The PET scan at screening should preferably be 
performed no later than 14 days (±7 days) prior to first treatment.

001-MCS-40-106_RD -03 (19.0) / Saved on: 05 Nov 2020To undergo a [18F]FDG-PET/CT examination, patients should fast before i.v. injection of
[18F]FDG. At the time point of [18F]FDG injection, plasma glucose level of the patient will be 
assessed. Immediately after [18F]FDG injection, patients must be advised to remain seated or 
to lie down and relax for approximately one hour before start of PET/CT scanning. Patients should be asked to void immediately prior to the PET/CT scan to reduce bladder activity.
Radiation dosimetry
The effective dose of [18F]FDG is 0.019 mSv/MBq (approximately 6-8 mSv per scan) ( R18-
3386 ). The organ receiving the largest radiation dose is the bladder (0.13 mGy/MBq) (R18-
3386). National regulations must be complied with in regard to the administration of 
radioactive substances and the CT exposure for the purpose of this study.
Image analysis
Visual, semi-quantitative and quantitative image interpretation will be performed (SUV
parameters). Treatment response will be scored according to standard guidelines e.g. EORTC response criteria ( R14-1470 ).
Further details regarding [18F]FDG-PET/CT imaging will be outlined in the Imaging Manual.

The information collected using PRO instruments can lend supportivearguments to the clinical activity or tolerability of a therapy and describe the extent to which patients’ physical, emotional and social well-being are affected by treatment. Patient-reported symptom data will be measured with the Patient Reported Outcomes version of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (PRO-CTCAE) ( R18-2068 )
Questionnaires will be completed at the time points specified in the Flow Chart . Paper
questionnaires should be completed at the site by patients prior to seeing the clinician,
prior to clinical assessment, prior to any treatment at the clinic, and before provision of
any new information about their disease status so that the responses are not influenced
(biased). The responses recorded on the questionnaires will not be recorded as adverseevents. Adverse events are collected during protocol specified study visits with the clinician.
The questionnaire generally takes about 10 minutes to complete. Patients will receive
the questionnaire in their native language in countries where validated translationsexist. The answered questionnaires will be entered into the CRF by the site personnel.
PRO-CTCAEPRO-CTCAE is a patient-reported outcome measure developed to evaluate symptomatic
toxicity in patients in cancer clinical trials. It was designed to be used as a companion tothe CTCAE criteria, the standard lexicon for adverse event reporting in cancer trials. 
5.7 APPROPRIATENESS OF MEASUREMENTS
All methods used are standard. Determination of MTD is based on toxicities graded 
according to CTCAE version 5.0 ( R18-1357 ). The CTCAE criteria are commonly used in the 
assessment of AEs in cancer patients. RECIST 1.1 ( R09-0262 ) is used for evaluation of 
response. These criteria are well-established and scientifically accepted.
PRO-CTCAE has been developed and validated in accordance with FDA and EMA guidance 
for patient-reported outcome measures.

001-MCS-40-106_RD -03 (19.0) / Saved on: 05 Nov 20206. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN
6.1 VISIT SCHEDULE
Patients must satisfy all inclusion and exclusion criteria prior to treatment administration (see
Section 3.3). Details of any patient who is screened for the study but is found ineligible must 
be entered in an enrolment log (see ISF) and documented in the eCRF. All patients are to 
adhere to the visit schedule as specified in the Flowchart . 
If a patient misses a visit during which there is no treatment administration planned, the visit 
should be rescheduled as soon as possible and the delayed visit documented with the actual date and the reason for the delay. The scheduling of subsequent visits must not be altered, so if it is not possible to reschedule prior to the next planned visit, the missed visit should be skipped.
If a patient is hospitalised for administrative reasons to allow treatment and PK sampling this 
will not be considered an SAE, unless any other criteria for an SAE are fulfilled.
In addition to the scheduled assessments, unscheduled visits and unscheduled assessments for 
safety reasons may be performed at any time according to clinical need.
In the event of force majeure or other disruptive circumstances (e.g. pandemic), sites should 
adhere to the required protocol procedures as close as possible, however the investigational plan as per this clinical trial protocol may not be feasible at a site. The patient may also be unable or unwilling to attend a clinic visit. The investigator must assess the risk-benefit for the individual patient and in agreement with the Sponsor may decide to implement alternative solutions (i.e. virtual patient visits and assessments) if this is in the best interest of the patient. Patient safety must be ensured when determining if a visit may be remote. The implementation of any alternative solutions will depend on patient’s consent, operational feasibility, local law and regulations. If alternative methodology is implemented, the deviations from the original plan will be precisely documented.
6.2 DETAILS OF TRIAL PROCEDURES AT SELECTED VISITS
Refer to the Flow Charts and Section 5for details on the procedures performed at each visit.
6.2.1 Screening period
Following informed consent, the patient will undergo screening assessments as indicated in 
the Flowchart.The assessments required during the screening period do not need to be conducted on the same day but must be conducted within a time interval of 28 days prior to the Cycle 1 Day1. Screening assessments may be repeated as long as they fall within the 28 day screening visit window. If more than one screening assessment is available, the latest assessment prior to the start of treatment must be used to assess eligibility.

001-MCS-40-106_RD -03 (19.0) / Saved on: 05 Nov 2020Rescreening for non CRC patients will be allowed if CDH17 positivity is confirmed.
A patient who has been declared as a “screening failure” may be re-screened once.In this situation patients will be handled as new patients i.e. sign a new informed consent, allocate a new patient number, and undergo full screening assessments to assess eligibility.
Tumor assessments performed prior to informed consent as part of routine clinical practice 
can be accepted if they meet the requirements of the protocol. For example, during the screening period, a tumor assessment does not need to be performed if there are valid results available from assessments which were performed within 28 days prior to start of treatment.
Demographics to be collected during the screening period
∀During the screening visit, demographics information will be collected. This includes: 
age on the day of informed consent (in years).
∀Sex (male, female in order to describe the subject`s sex at birth), 
∀Gender identity (male, female, other in order to describe how the subject self-
identifies regardless of their genotypic or phenotypic sex)
∀For women: of childbearing potential yes / no in order to characterize the patient 
population and as a basis for contraception requirements.
∀Ethnicity and race in order to sufficiently characterize the patient population and to support possible subgroup analyses unless not acceptable according to local regulations.
Baseline Conditions
Baseline conditions and concomitant therapies present during screening will be recorded in
the eCRF.
Medical History:
A general medical history and a detailed oncological disease history will be collected.
The oncological history to be reported on the eCRF will include:
∀Date of first histological diagnosis
∀The primary tumor site
∀Staging and grading information
∀The number and location of metastatic sites
∀Previous treatment for the tumor, including any surgery, radiotherapy, and/or 
systemic therapy including start and stop dates and outcome.
∀Any known genomic alterations such as but not limited to BRAF, KRAS, HER2,
BRCA, and the immune markers status (i.e. microsatellite instability and/or DNA mismatch repair deficiency).
∀The date of tumor progression after previous lines of treatment will be recorded if 
known, including start and end dates and outcome.

Subsequent visits and assessments during the treatment period are performed as described in the Flowchart . 
See Section 4.1.5.2 for criteria for receiving further treatment.
Patients may continue on treatment for unlimited cycles until criteria for stopping treatment 
are met (See Section 3.3.4.1 ).
PK, biomarkers, other speciality samples collected for reasons other than safety may be 
discontinued if the sponsor decides that sufficient information has been collected. 
6.2.3 Follow-up period and trial completion
The post treatment period will consist of an End of Treatment (EoT) visit, a 30-day safety 
follow-up visit (EoR) as well as follow-up visits for disease progression (PD) and overall survival (OS).
6.2.3.1 End of treatment (EoT) visitThe EoT visit will be performed as soon as possible but not later than 14 days after 
permanent discontinuation of trial medication for any reason or e.g. when the investigator 
decided with the patient to permanently discontinue the trial medication or became aware that 
the trial medication had been terminated. The EoT assessments will be performed instead of the next planned visit as noted in the Flow Charts.
6.2.3.2 End of Residual Effect Period (EoR)
The End of Residual Effect Period (EoR) visit (FUP #1) should occur no earlier than 30 days 
(+ ≤ 5 days) after the last dose of treatment in order to evaluate safety. Assessments will be 
performed as noted in the Flow Charts
6.2.3.3 Follow-up for progressive diseaseThe end of study is defined as EOR. No further follow-up visits after EOR are required, 
unless follow-up is for S(AE) that occurred before EOR period. 
If death date is known, this should be reported in the CRF.  
6.2.3.4 Follow-up for overall survival status
Effective from CTP v4.0, this section is not applicable.

written correspondence. If a patient cannot be contacted for survival status, information may also be obtained by other means in accordance with informed consent language and local regulations (e.g. contact with patients’ health care providers, public sources, e.g. death registry, obituary listing, etc.) when it is available and verifiable. The last follow-up visit will be considered the “end-of-trial” visit.The following patient status information will be collected during the FUP timepoints for survival status:
∀Date of contact
∀Further anti-cancer treatment including surgery and radiotherapy: regimen and drug 
name, start and stop dates.
∀For each reportable serious adverse event / AESI, the investigator should provide the 
information with regard to concomitant medication and the medication administered to treat the adverse events on the appropriate CRF pages and the SAE form including trade name, indication and dates of administration
∀Outcome event (e.g. death: Record date of and reason for outcome event / death [if 
applicable])

001-MCS-40-106_RD -03 (19.0) / Saved on: 05 Nov 20207. STATISTICAL METHODS AND DETERMINATION OF
SAMPLE SIZE
7.1 NULL AND ALTERNATIVE HYPOTHESES
The statistical analyses in this trial are descriptive and exploratory. No formal statistical test 
will be performed.
7.2 PLANNED ANALYSES
7.2.1 General considerations
No per protocol set will be used in the analysis. However, important protocol deviations
(iPDs) will be summarised. Adherence to the protocol will be assessed by the trial team. iPDscategories will be specified in the iPD specification document. IPDs will be identified at trial oversight meetings and documented in the iPD log. The iPD categories will be updated as needed.
For determination of the MTD, only MTD evaluable patients with be considered. For 
analyses of secondary and further endpoints, all patients in the treated set (i.e., patients treated with at least one dose of trial medication) will be used if not specified differently. Any other analysis set will be defined in the TSAP.
7.2.2 Handling of intercurrent events
The expected intercurrent events of interest are:
- treatment discontinuation during the MTD evaluation period- progressive disease during the MTD evaluation period- death during the MTD evaluation period- dose reduction during the MTD evaluation period- any events that cause missed visits during the MTD evaluation period
The strategy for handling intercurrent events in this trial is as follows: 
If the intercurrent event follows criteria defined in section 3.3.4.1.1 then the patient will be 
considered not evaluable for MTD and will not be considered in the primary analysis, 
otherwise the patient should still be considered in the primary analysis. This corresponds to a principal stratum strategy. 
7.2.3 Primary objective analyses
Phase Ia dose escalation:
This trial will be performed as an open label. 
The primary objective in phase Ia is to determine the MTD and the recommended dose for expansion (RDE) of BI 905711 in combination with FOLFIRI plus bevacizumab. MTD is defined as the highest dose with less than 25% risk of the true DLT rate being equal or above 0.33 (EWOC criterion). Dose-escalation for each group will be guided by a two-parameter Bayesian Logistic Regression Model (BLRM), escalating with overdose control (EWOC)

001-MCS-40-106_RD -03 (19.0) / Saved on: 05 Nov 2020(R13-4803 ; R13-4806 ). 
The Bayesian logistic regression model (BLRM) is formulated as follows:
Xd~ Binomial (n d, πd),
logit(πd) = log(α) + β*log(d/d*), 
where logit( π) = log(π/(1-π)).
Xddenotes the random variable describing the observed number of DLTs in n dpatients at the 
dose d.
πdrepresents the probability of having a DLT in the the MTD evaluation period at dose d, d* 
= 3.6 mg/kg is the reference dose, allowing for the interpretation of α as the odds of a DLT at 
dose d*, and θ = (log(α), log(β)) with α, β > 0 is the parameter vector of the model.
The estimated probability of a DLT at each dose level from the model will be summarized 
using the following intervals:
Under toxicity: [0.00, 0.16)
Targeted toxicity: [0.16, 0.33)Over toxicity: [0.33, 1.00]
The BLRM-recommended dose for the next dose cohort is the dose level with the highest 
posterior probability of the DLT rate falling in the target interval of [0.16, 0.33) among the doses fulfilling the EWOC principle. With the EWOC criterion, it should be unlikely (i.e. posterior probability <25%) that the DLT rate at the recommended dose will exceed 0.33. The maximum allowable dose increment for each escalation step shall not be more than 100%. 
The MTD will be considered reached if one of the following criteria is fulfilled: 
∀the posterior probability of the true DLT rate in the target interval [0.16, 0.33) of the 
MTD is above 0.5
∀OR at least 12 patients have been treated in phase Ia, of which at least 6 at the MTD. 
The DRC may recommend stopping the dose escalation phase after the criterion for MTD is 
fulfilled. 
Prior derivation:By the time BLRM is analyzed, safety data for BI 905711 are expected to be available from
BI Study 1412-0001. The information can be incorporated into the prior derivation meta-analytic predictive (MAP) approach. The safety data for BI 905711 in 1412-0001 dated April 15
th2021 can be found in Table 7.2.3:1 , and is used in prior derivation.

The prior may be updated once the data in trial 1412-0001 has been updated. The prior used 
for each BLRM analysis for the DRC meetings will be documented in the DRC minutes, the prior used for the final analysis will be documented in the TSAP.
Phase Ib Dose Expansion:
A safety run-in will be performed for the first 6 patients in the PDAC expansion cohort. After 
the first 6 patients have been treated for at least two cycles, the DRC will assess the overall safety profile and confirm the RDE of BI 905711 plus FOLFIRI (or Liposomal Irinotecan plus 5-FU/Leucovorin) in PDAC cohort. If additional DLTs are observed during the safety run-in phase, a separate BLRM with overdose control will be used to re-estimate the recommended dose for PDAC expansion cohort. The available data from CRC cohorts can be incorporated into the model by a meta-analytic predictive (MAP) approach.
The primary endpoint in the dose-expansion part is objective response (OR) derived from the 
data of all cycles. Descriptive analyses will be conducted for this endpoint.
Details will be specified in the TSAP.

Secondary time-to-event endpoints will be analyzed by Kaplan-Meier estimates. Other
secondary endpoints will be analyzed descriptively. Details of the secondary endpoint analyses will be specified in the trial statistical analysis plan (TSAP).
7.2.5 Further objective analyses
PK analyses are specified in Section 5.3.1 and will be calculated by means of 
noncompartmental analysis. Descriptive statistics will be used to evaluate plasma 
concentration data and PK parameters. Further details on analysis will be described in the TSAP.
Biomarker analysis are specified in Section 5.4. Exploratory analysis will be used to evaluate 
potential patient selection biomarkers and pharmacodynamic changes triggered by treatment 
intervention between baseline and on-treatment samples. All analysis will be further described in the TSAP.
The precise level of tumor markers could be expressed as median, mean, and range values 
including changes over time. Pearson correlation analysis could be used as acorrelation 
analysis of CEA and CA19-9. Further details and decisions on the analysis will be described in the TSAP.
PRO data collected using the PRO-CTCAE questionnaire will be analysed descriptively,
including changes over time. Further details on analysis will be described in the TSAP.
7.2.6 Safety analyses
Adverse events will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Drug Regulatory Activities 
(MedDRA). Standard BI summary tables and listings will be produced. All adverse events with an onset between start of treatment and end of the REP will be assigned to the on-treatment period for evaluation.
All treated patients will be included in the safety analysis. In general, safety analyses will be 
descriptive in nature and will be based on BI standards. No hypothesis testing is planned.
Statistical analysis and reporting of adverse events will concentrate on treatment-emergent 
adverse events, i.e. all adverse events occurring between start of treatment and end of the REP. Adverse events that start before first drug intake and deteriorate under treatment will also be considered as ‘treatment-emergent’.
Frequency, severity, and causal relationship of adverse events will be tabulated by system 
organ class and preferred term after coding according to the current version of the Medical Dictionary for Drug Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) at database lock.

be done via comparison of laboratory data to their reference ranges. Values outside the reference range as well as values defined as clinically relevant will be summarised. Treatment groups will be compared descriptively with regard to distribution parameters as well as with regard to frequency and percentage of patients with abnormal values or clinically relevant abnormal values.
Vital signs, physical examinations, or other safety-relevant data observed at screening, 
baseline, during the course of the trial and at the end-of-trial evaluation will be assessed with regard to possible changes compared to findings before start of treatment.
7.2.7 Other analyses
Not applicable
7.2.8 Interim analyses
In the Phase Ia, interim safety evaluations will be performed as considered necessary. In 
particular safety evaluations, after each dose cohort, will be performed by the DRC. Based on 
this, the DRC will recommend the next dose level as well as the corresponding cohort size.
In the phase Ib, if any DLTs observed in patients enrolled in phase Ib, the BLRM will be run 
to confirm if the dose level still fulfills the overdose risk control.
No formal interim analysis of efficacy data is foreseen, although efficacy data, PK and 
biomarker data when available may be considered as part of the regular evaluation of trial data.
No formal interim analysis is planned for PK and immunogenicity.Preliminary, exploratory analysis of PK and if applicable of immunogenicity may be 
performed prior to database lock during study conduct based on all evaluable data at the time of analysis. In contrast to the final calculations, the preliminary, exploratory analysis will be based on planned sampling times rather than on actual times, regardless of whether actual times were within the time windows or not. Therefore, minor deviations in preliminary and final results may occur. No formal preliminary PK and immunogenicity report will be written.
7.3 HANDLING OF MISSING DATA
Plasma concentration - time profiles 
Concentration data identified with NOS (no sample), NOR (no valid result), NOA (not to the lag phase) will be ignored and not replaced by zero at any time point (including the lag phase).

limit of quantification), NOR, NOS, NOA are included).
Pharmacokinetic parameters
In the non-compartmental analysis, concentration data identified with NOS, NOR, and NOA will not be considered. BLQ values in the lag phase will be set to zero. The lag phase is defined as the period between time zero and the first time point with a concentration above the quantification limit. All other BLQ values of the profile will be ignored.
Every effort will be made to include all concentration data in an analysis. If not possible, a 
case-to-case decision is required whether the value should only be excluded from half-life estimation or the complete analysis.
If a concentration is only excluded from half-life determination, it will be used for all other 
calculations (e.g., descriptive statistics) and for graphical presentation.
If a concentration value is excluded from all calculations, it will not be presented graphically 
or used for the calculation of descriptive statistics and parameter determination. However, the excluded concentration itself will be listed in the clinical trial report associated with an appropriate flag. If the actual sampling time is not recorded or is missing for a certain time point, the planned time will generally be used for this time point instead. Pharmacokinetic parameters which cannot be determined will be identified by "not calculated" (NC).
In general, no imputation will be performed on missing efficacy data. Missing baseline 
laboratory values will be imputed by the respective values from the screening visit. No other imputations will be performed on missing data although every effort will be made to obtain complete information on all AEs, with emphasis on potential DLTs.
7.4 RANDOMIZATION
Randomization will be performed in the CRC cohort of phase Ib part of this trial only. 
The randomization list will be generated using a validated system. Randomization ratio is 2:1 for BI 905711 with FOLFIRI plus bevacizumab and FOLFIRI plus bevacizumab arms. 
The randomization list will be generated using a validated system. Access to the 
randomization codes will be controlled and documented.
7.5 DETERMINATION OF SAMPLE SIZE
No formal statistical power calculations to determine sample size were performed for this 
trial. The sample size for dose escalation relies on the assumption of dose-toxicity correlation model. Up to 20 patients in dose escalation group are planned to be enrolled into the dose escalation phase based on the expected dose levels that are going to be investigated. However, the actual number of patients will depend on the number of dose cohorts tested. 
In phase Ib 2
ndline CRC cohort, 60 patients will be enrolled. Specifically, 40 patients will be 
treated with BI 905711 in combination with FOLFIRI + bevacizumab as treatment arm, and

considered sufficient to limit the error probability of observing more than 15% difference in response rate to no more than around 6% if the true response rates are constant 30% in both arms. With this number of patients, the probability of observing a 15% increase in ORR from treatment arm to control arm will be at least around 75% under the scenario where ORR was assumed to be 20% higher in treatment arm than control arm.
In phase Ib 2
ndline PDAC cohort, 20 patients will be enrolled. Historical control response
rate for 2L PDAC is around 15% (chemotherapy only). The probability of observing 5 or more responders from 20 patients is no more than 17% assuming no additional benefit from investigational combination.

responsibility of the treating physician of the patient.
The investigator will inform the sponsor immediately of any urgent safety measures taken to 
protect the trial patients against any immediate hazard, as well as of any serious breaches of the protocol or of ICH GCP.The Boehringer Ingelheim transparency and publication policy can be found on the following web page: trials.boehringer-ingelheim.com. The rights of the investigator and of the sponsorwith regard to publication of the results of this trial are described in the investigator contract. As a rule, no trial results should be published prior to finalisation of the Clinical Trial Report.
The certificate of insurance cover is made available to the investigator and the patients, and is
stored in the ISF.
8.1 TRIAL APPROVAL, PATIENT INFORMATION, INFORMED CONSENT
This trial will be initiated only after all required legal documentation has been reviewed and 
approved by the respective Institutional Review Board (IRB / Independent Ethics Committee (IEC and competent authority according to national and international regulations. The same applies for the implementation of changes introduced by amendments.Prior to patient participation in the trial, written informed consent must be obtained from each patient (or the patient’s legally accepted representative) according to ICH-GCP and to the regulatory and legal requirements of the participating country. Each signature must be personally dated by each signatory and the informed consent and any additional patient-information form retained by the investigator as part of the trial records. A signed copy of the informed consent and any additional patient information must be given to each patient or the patient’s legally accepted representative.

001-MCS-40-106_RD -03 (19.0) / Saved on: 05 Nov 2020The patient must be given sufficient time to consider participation in the trial. The 
investigator or delegate obtains written consent of the patient’s own free will with the informed consent form after confirming that the patient understands the contents. The investigator or  delegate must sign (or place a seal on) and date the informed consent form. If a trial collaborator has given a supplementary explanation, the trial collaborator also signs (or places a seal on) and dates the informed consent.Re-consenting may become necessary when new relevant information becomes available and should be conducted according to the sponsor’s instructions.The consent and re-consenting process should be properly documented in the source documentation.
8.2 DATA QUALITY ASSURANCE
A risk-based approach is used for trial quality management. It is initiated by the assessment 
of critical data and processes for trial subject protection and reliability of the results as well as identification and assessment of associated risks. An Integrated Quality and Risk Management Plan or alternative plan, in line with the guidance provided by ICH Q9 and ICH-GCP E6, for fully outsourced trials, documents the rationale and strategies for risk 
management during trial conduct including monitoring approaches, vendor management and 
other processes focusing on areas of greatest risk.Continuous risk review and assessment may lead to adjustments in trial conduct, trial design or monitoring approaches. A quality assurance audit / inspection of this tr ial may be conducted by the sponsor, sponsor’s 
designees, or by IRB / IEC or by regulatory authorities. The quality assurance auditor will have access to all medical records, the investigator’s trial-related files and correspondence, and the informed consent documentation of this clinical trial.
8.3 RECORDS
CRFs for individual patients will be provided by the sponsor. For drug accountability, refer to 
section 4.1.9 .
8.3.1 Source documents
In accordance with regulatory requirements, the investigator should prepare and maintain 
adequate and accurate source documents and trial records that include all observations and other data pertinent to the investigation on each trial patient. Source data as well as reported data should follow the “ALCOA principles” and be attributable, legible, contemporaneous, 
original and accurate. Changes to the data should be traceable (audit trail).
Data reported on the CRF must be consistent with the source data or the discrepancies must 
be explained.The current medical history of the patient may not be sufficient to confirm eligibility for the trial and the investigator may need to request previous medical histories and evidence of any diagnostic tests. In this case, the investigator must make at least three documented attempts to retrieve previous medical records. If this fails, a verbal history from the patient, documented in their medical records, would be acceptable.

001-MCS-40-106_RD -03 (19.0) / Saved on: 05 Nov 2020Copies of source documents may be collected for safety review (i.e. CT/MRI, ECG). Before
sending or uploading those copies, the investigator must ensure that all patient identifiers (e.g. 
patient’s name, initials, address, phone number, social security number) have properly been removed or redacted from any copy of the patients’ source documents.If the patient is not compliant with the protocol, any corrective action e.g. re-training must be documented in the patient file.For the CRF, data must be derived from source documents, for example:
∀Patient identification: gender, year of birth (in accordance with local laws and 
regulations)
∀Patient participation in the trial (substance, trial number, patient number, date patient
was informed)
∀Dates of patient’s visits, including dispensing of trial medication
∀Medical history (including trial indication and concomitant diseases, if applicable)
∀Medication history
∀Adverse events and outcome events (onset date (mandatory), and end date (if 
available))
∀Serious adverse events (onset date (mandatory), and end date (if available))
∀Concomitant therapy (start date, changes)
∀Originals or copies of laboratory results and other imaging or testing results, with 
proper documented medical evaluation (in validated electronic format, if available)
∀Completion of patient’s participation in the trial” (end date; in case of premature 
discontinuation document the reason for it).
∀Prior to allocation of a patient to a treatment into a clinical trial, there must be 
documented evidence in the source data (e.g. medical records) that the trial participant meets all inclusion criteria and does not meet any exclusion criteria. The absence of records (either medical records, verbal documented feedback of the patient or testing conducted specific for a protocol) to support inclusion / exclusion criteria does not make the patient eligible for the clinical trial.
8.3.2 Direct access to source data and documents
The investigator / institution will allow site trial-related monitoring, audits, IRB / IEC review 
and regulatory inspections. Direct access must be provided to the CRF and all source documents / data, including progress notes, copies of laboratory and medical test results, which must be available at all times for review by the CRA, auditor and regulatory inspector (e.g. FDA). They may review all CRFs and informed consents. The accuracy of the data will be verified by direct comparison with the source documents described in section 8.3.1 .T h e  
sponsor or delegate will also monitor compliance with the protocol and GCP.
In the event of force majeure or other disrupting circumstances (e.g. pandemic, war, please 
see section 6). Site access may be restricted thus limiting the ability to perform standard site
monitoring activities on site such as on-site source data review and source data verification.

monitoring to the extent possible, based on a documented risk assessment and in alignment with local regulations
8.3.3 Storage period of records
Trial site(s):
The trial site(s) must retain the source and essential documents (including ISF) according to 
contract or the local requirements valid at the time of the end of the trial (whatever is longer).Sponsor:
The sponsor must retain the essential documents according to the sponsor’s SOPs.
8.4 EXPEDITED REPORTING OF ADVERSE EVENTS
BI is responsible to fulfil their legal and regulatory reporting obligation in accordance with
regulatory requirements. Exemptions from expedited reporting are described in section 5.2.6.2.4 .
8.5 STATEMENT OF CONFIDENTIALITY AND PATIENT PRIVACY
Data protection and data security measures are implemented for the collection, storage and 
processing of patient data in accordance with the principles 7 and 12 of the WHO GCP 
handbook.To ensure confidentiality of records and personal data, only pseudonymised data will be transferred to the sponsor by using a patient identification number instead of the patient’s name. The code is only available at the site and must not be forwarded to the sponsor. In case patient’s records will be forwarded e.g. for SAE processing or adjudication committees, personal data that can identify the patient will be redacted by the site prior to forwarding.Access to the patient files and clinical data is strictly limited: personalised treatment data may be given to the patient’s personal physician or to other appropriate medical personnel responsible for the patient’s welfare. Data generated at the site as a result of the trial need to be available for inspection on request by the participating physicians, the sponsor’s representatives, by the IRB / IEC and the regulatory authorities.
A potential data security breach will be assessed regarding the implications for rights and 
privacy of the affected person(s). Immediate actions as well as corrective and preventive actions will be implemented. Respective regulatory authorities, IRBs / IECs and patients will be informed as appropriate.
8.5.1 Collection, storage and future use of biological samples and corresponding 
data 
Measures are in place to comply with the applicable rules for the collection, biobanking and 
future use of biological samples and clinical data, in particular

10.1 PHARMACOKINETIC ANALYSES
If feasible, the following PK parameters of BI 905711 will be evaluated using non
compartmental analysis methods.
After the first doses:
• Cmax (maximum measured concentration)
• AUC0-∞ (area under the concentration-time curve over the time interval from zero 
extrapolated to infinity)• AUC0-tz (area under the concentration-time curve over the time interval from 0 up to the last quantifiable data point)• tz (time point of the last quantifiable plasma concentration)• %AUCtz- ∞ (the percentage of the AUC0- ∞ that is obtained by extrapolation)
• AUCt1-t2 (area under the concentration time curve over the time interval t1 to t2)• tmax (time from dosing to the maximum measured concentration)• Cpre,N (the pre-dose concentration of the analyte in plasma immediately before administration of the Nth dose after N-1 doses were administered)• t1/2 (terminal half-life)• CL (total clearance of the analyte)• Vz (apparent volume of distribution during the terminal phase)• Vss (volume of distribution after intravenous infusion)
If feasible, the following additional PK parameters may be determined after repeated doses 
[If steady state can reasonably be assumed, the parameters will be denoted with ss as shown; otherwise, they will be denoted with the dose number of the last dose]:
• Cmax,ss (maximum measured concentration at steady state)
• Cmin,ss (minimum concentration at steady state)• tmin,ss (time to reach minimum concentration at steady state)• Cavg (average concentration at steady state)• Cpre, N,ss (pre-dose concentration at steady state immediately before administration of the next dose)
• AUCτ,ss (area under the concentration-time curve at steady state over a uniform dosing 
interval τ)
• AUCt1-t2,ss (area under the concentration time curve over the time interval t1 to t2 at steady state)• tmax,ss (time from last dosing to maximum concentration at steady state)• tz,ss (time of last measurable concentration within the dosing interval τ at steady state)
• λz,ss (terminal rate constant at steady state)
• t1/2,ss (terminal half-life at steady state)• MRTinf,ss (mean residence time in the body after intravenous infusion at steady state)• CLss (total clearance at steady state)• Vz,ss (volume of distribution during the terminal phase after multiple intravascular administrations at steady)

aThe following windows of time are allowed for PK sampling:
1. Pre-dose (PTM -0:05): within 1 hour before next drug infusion/drug administration.
2. 7h: within ± 15 min of designated time
3. 24- 48h: within ±60 min of designated time.4. 168h ±24 hourTime windows are specified for procedural reasons; deviations do not automatically lead to exclusion of samples from data evaluation.
bIn the event that infusion duration is >60 minutes longer than planned, the subsequent time points for PK blood 
collection on the day of drug infusion should be adjusted accordingly. 
cOne blood sample to isolate genomic DNA will be obtained at C1V1 before treatment. 6 plasma samples will 
be collected to isolate circulating nucleic acids (e.g. cfDNA) from plasma: at C1V1 before treatment, C1D10, 
C3D1, C4D1, C5D1 and EOT after treatment.
dPK, ADA and NAB sampling is to be collected pre-dose (-0:05) at Day 3 of Cycle 14 and every 3 months 
thereafter (Cycle 20, Cycle 26, etc.)..
eIf the patient will not continue treatment in the next scheduled cycle, pre-dose sampling scheduled for Day 3 of 
the next cycle needs to be performed at the EOT visit. 
fPer section 4.2.4.1 , if less than 50% of the planned dose of BI 905711 was administered due to an infusion-
related reaction, a further dose of 50% of the intended total dose may be administered on the following day and 
after recovery to baseline for at least 24 hours. If this scenario occurs, the PK sample should be collected just before the start of the further infusion. A second PK sample should also be collected before the end of the further infusion.Treatment

introduced in Section 7including prior specifications for the model. After patients in each 
cohort have completed at least the MTD evaluation period, the prior distribution will be 
updated with the accumulated DLT data from the MTD evaluation period. Posterior probabilities for the rate of DLTs will be summarised from the BLRM. Selection of the next dose level will be based on these probabilities as well as on other safety and laboratory data.
The purpose of this statistical appendix is to present performance metrics (operating 
characteristics) that illustrate the precision of the design in estimating the MTD under various dose-toxicity relationships through computer simulation. These results are summarised in Table 10.3:3 . In addition, recommendations of the next dose level by the BLRM with 
overdose control principle are also provided under various hypothetical outcome scenarios to 
show how it facilitates on-trial dose-escalation decisions (see Table 10.3: 1 ). For simplicity 
reasons, a cohort size of 3 patients who are all evaluable is assumed.
The simulations for scenarios and operating characteristics were produced using R version 
4.0.2 and Jags version 4.3.0.
Hypothetical data scenarios for dose escalation
Hypothetical data scenarios are shown in Table 10.3: 1. These scenarios reflect potential on-
trial data scenarios and related escalation as allowed by the model, the probability of overdose for the current dose level, as well as the next potential dose level and related probabilities of DLT rate falling into the under toxicity, target toxicity and over toxicityintervals. 
For example, Scenario 1 represents the case where 3 patients were treated in 1412-0003 trial 
with no DLTs and the current dose level in 1412-0003 trial is 0.6 mg/kg. Given this information, the posterior probability of over-dose for the current dose level in 1412-0003 trial is 0.008, which is under the EWOC threshold. In this case, the BLRM recommendation is to escalate to 1.2 mg/kg.
Scenario 2 shows to stay at the current dose level and enroll more patients when the first DLT 
occurs out of 3 patients in the first dose level cohort. 
Similarly, in scenario 3 when no DLT occurs out of 3 patients in the first two cohorts, the 
BLRM recommends escalating to the next dose level. 
Scenarios 4, 8 and 9 show examples of staying at the current dose level with 1 DLT out of 3 
patients and continue to observe more patients. The probability of over-dose for the current dose level in scenario 4 trial is 0.104, which is under the EWOC threshold. 
Scenarios 6, 7 show that with 0 DLT up to the current dose level, the model's 
recommendation is to escalate to the next dose level which over-dose is under control.

001-MCS-40-106_RD -03 (19.0) / Saved on: 05 Nov 2020Operating characteristics are a way to assess the long-run behaviour of a model. Under an 
assumed true dose-toxicity curve, metrics such as the probability of recommending a dose with true DLT rate in the target interval can be approximated via simulation. Table 10.3:2describes 5 assumed true dose-toxicity scenarios which were used to assess the operating characteristics of the model. These scenarios reflect a wide range of possible cases as follows:
∀Scenario 1: aligned with prior means
∀Scenario 2: high-toxicity scenario
∀Scenario 3: low-toxicity scenario
∀Scenario 4: non-logistic dose-toxicity scenario
∀Scenario 5: low-toxicity followed by high-toxicity
∀Scenario 6: high toxicity followed by extremely toxic scenario
Table 10.3: 2 Probability of having a DLT under the assumed dose-toxicity scenarios
Scenario/Dose 0.6 1.2 2.4 3.6 4.8
1: Prior information (mean) 0.06 0.1 0.18 0.28 0.38
2: High toxicity 0.1 0.2 0.25 0.39 0.45
3: Low toxicity 0.01 0.02 0.04 0.1 0.18
4: Non-logistic 0.05 0.12 0.2 0.3 0.4
5: Low-high 0.02 0.07 0.3 0.36 0.45
6: Extremely toxic 0.32 0.36 0.40 0.45 0.50
Note: Probabilities in bold indicate the true DLT rates which fall into the targeted toxicity 
interval [0.16, 0.33).
For each of the five scenarios, 1000 trials were simulated. Each cohort consisted of 3 patients 
and dose escalation complied with the following rules: escalate to the dose which maximises the probability of the targeted toxicity region and satisfies the overdose criterion if it is ≤ 
100% increase from the current dose. 
The MTD was considered reached when the rules in Section 7.1are fulfilled. If the MTD 
could not be reached, because already the first specified dose level was too toxic, or none of 
the dose levels revealed any DLTs, the simulated trial was stopped.
The simulation assessed how often a dose was declared as MTD with true DLT rate in the 
under-, targeted- or over-dose range. The average, minimum and maximum number of patients per trial and the average number of DLTs per trial are reported. Results are shown inTable 10.3: 3 .

In Scenario 1, which reflects the case that the true dose-toxicity is aligned with the prior 
expectations regarding toxicity probabilities, 62.1% of the simulated trials choose the correct dose as MTD, that is a dose as MTD with the assumed true DLT rate in the target dose range.
In Scenario 2 (high-toxicity scenario), the starting dose level has 10% probability of 
observing DLTs in the first cohort. This would result in 7% of the simulated trials stopping due to too high toxicity. 
Scenario 3 (low-toxicity scenario) shows that only the highest dose level falls in the target 
dose range. In this case, 43.3% of the simulated trials choose a dose as MTD, which the assumed true DLT rate is within the under-dose range. 56.7% of the simulated trials result inan MTD with the assumed true DLT rate in the target-dose range. And the probability of declaring an over toxic dose as MTD is 0%.
When the true dose toxicity curve does not follow logistic function, as shown in Scenario 4, 
the percentage of declaring a dose as MTD with the assumed true DLT rate in the target dose range is 58.7%.
In scenario 5, the probability of declaring MTD with the assumed true DLT rate in the target 
dose range is 49.6%. 
In scenario 6, due to extremely high toxicity, the probability of stopping the trial is 60.6%.

001-MCS-40-106_RD -03 (19.0) / Saved on: 05 Nov 2020The mean patient numbers range from 9.2 patients (Scenario 6) to 19 patients (Scenario 3)
and the maximum number of patients was 45. Therefore, the patient numbers are as expected and increase when moving away from the high-toxicity scenario.Overall, by reviewing the OC presented in Table 10.3: 3 , it can be seen that the model is 
robust to different scenarios of true dose-toxicity curves. In general, the model is 
conservative due to the overdose control criteria. In all scenarios, the probabilities of recommending a dose with true P(DLT) ≥ 33% as MTD are much smaller than probabilities 
of recommending a dose with true P(DLT) between 16% and 33% as MTD.
On-study recommendations based on the model are consistent with the clinical decision-
making process and should be considered in conjunction with other available clinical information by the BI clinical trial team and trial investigators in deciding the dose levels to be tested in order to determine the MTD estimate.
R version 4.0.2 and RStudio 1.3.959 version were used for the simulations.

This decision is not related to any safety concerns or unfavorable benefit/risk balance, but to the lack of predictive biomarkers and the limited efficacy particularly in the context of the evolving treatment landscape for advanced CRC and other GI cancers. 
The purpose of CTP v4.0 is to reduce the study 
related activities to the minimum required to monitor patient safety and to avoid undue burden on patients.”

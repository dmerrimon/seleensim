Name of Investigational Product:  IDP-126 Gel 
Name of Active Ingredients:  Fixed combination of clindamycin phosphate 1.2% , benzoyl peroxide 
(BPO)  3.1%, and adapalene 0.15%  
Title of Study:  A Phase 3, Multic enter, Randomized, Double -Blind, Vehicle -Controlled, Parallel -Group 
Clinical Study Comparing the Efficacy and Safety of IDP-126 Gel in the Treatment of Acne Vulgaris  
Number of Clinical Centers : Multicenter, approximately 15 study centers in North America   
Objective:  
The primary objective of this study is to compare the efficacy, safety and tolerability of IDP -126 Gel in 
subjects with moderate to severe acne vulgaris . The safety and efficacy of once daily application of 
IDP-126 Gel will be compared to IDP -126 Vehicle  Gel. 
Methodology:  
This is a multicenter, randomized, double -blind, vehicle -controlled, 12- week study designed to assess the 
safety, tolerability, and efficacy of IDP -126 Gel in comparison IDP -126 Vehicle  Gel at Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 
12. To be eligible for the study, subjects must be at least 9 years of age and have a clinical diagnosis of 
moderate to severe acne (defined as an Evaluator’s Global Severity Score [ EGSS] of 3 or 4), presenting 
with 30-100 inflammatory facial lesions  (papules, pus tules, and nodules),  35-150 non-inflammatory facial 
lesions (open and closed comedones), and ≤  2 facial nodules .      
All subjects will receive once daily, topically  applied  treatment to the face for 12 weeks. Subject visits 
include Screening, Baseline, Week 2, Week 4, Week 8, and Week 12, at which safety and efficacy 
assessments will be conducted  (Screening and Baseline may occur on the same day if no washout is 
required) . Study drug will be dispensed to the s ubjects at the Baseline, Week 4 , and Week 8  study visits . 
Subjects will be evaluated for drug usage compliance at each post  baseline study visit s (Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 
12). Subjects will apply their treatments at home, once daily  (in the evening), as instructed by the study 
coordinator or designee at each study cen ter.  
The investigator will assess the subject’s face at each study visit. Information on reported and observed 
AEs will be obtained at each visit. An abbreviated physical examination and vital sign  measurement s will 
be performed at Baseline and Week 12 (end of study ) for all subjects. Blood samples wil l be collected  
from subjects at Baseline  and Week 12, for CBC/Diff and serum  chemistry. For all female subjects of 
childbearing potential (FOCBP), urine pregnancy testing will be performed at Screening, Basel ine (prior 
to randomization ), and at Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12. Additionally , serum pregnancy testing will be performed 
at Baseline and Week 12.  
In addition, at selected study center s, standardized photography of the face will be performed at Baseline, 
and Weeks  4, 8 and 12.  
Number of subjects planned:  
Approximately 180 subjects will be randomized in a  2:1 ratio to the following treatment groups:  
• 120 Subjects to IDP -126 Gel ( clindamycin phosphate 1.2% /BPO 3.1%/adapalene 0.15% ) 
• 60 Subjects to IDP -126 Vehicle  Gel

 Reference therapy, dosage and mode of administration:  
• IDP-126 Vehicle  Gel applied once daily for 12 weeks.  
Criteria for evaluation:  
Co-Primary efficacy:  
IDP-126 Gel will be compared to IDP -126 Vehicle Gel. 
Co-primary endpoints are:  
(1) Absolute  change from Baseline to Week 12 in - inflammatory lesion counts  
(2) Absolute  change from Baseline to Week 12 in - non-inflammatory lesion counts,   
      and,  
(3) Percent age of subjects who achieve at least a two -grade reduction from baseline and are Clear or 
Almost Clear at Week 12 in the EGSS. 
Secondary efficacy:  
• Percent change  in inflammatory lesion count from Baseline to Week 12  
• Percent  change  in non -inflammatory  lesion count from B aseline to Week 12  
• Percentage of subjects who have at least a 2 grade reduction at Week 12 from Baseline in the 
Evaluator’s Global Severity Score  
• Percent change in inflammatory lesion count from Baseline to Week 8  
• Percent change in non -inflammatory lesion count from Baseline to Week 8  
• Percent change in inflammatory lesion count from Baseline to Week 4  
• Percent change in non -inflammatory lesion count from Baseline to Week 4  
 
Supportive Efficacy:  
• Percent change in inflammatory lesion count from Baseline to Week 2  
• Percent change in non -inflammatory lesion count from Baseline to  Week 2  
• Percentage of subjects who have at least a 2 grade reduction at Week 8 from Baseline in the 
Evaluator’s Global Severity Score  
• Percentage of subjects who have at least a 2 grade reduction at Week 4 from Baseline in the Evaluator’s Global Severity Sc ore 
• Percentage of subjects who have at least a 2 grade reduction at Week 2 from Baseline in the Evaluator’s Global Severity Score  
Efficacy Measurements:  
Lesion Counts  
At each visit , the e valuator will count the total number of inflammatory lesions (papules , pustules, and 
nodules) on the subject’s face. Nodules will be counted separately , but will be included in the total 
inflammatory lesion count. At baseline, eligible subjects may have no more than 2 nodules. Nodules will 
be included in the statistical analysis of inflammatory lesion counts. All inflammatory lesions will be counted at the same time rather than counting papules and pustules separately. The evaluator will als o 
count the total number of non-inflammatory  lesion s (open and closed comedones). The  same blinded 
evaluator should perform the lesion counts and EGSS evaluations at all visits from baseline to week 12 for the same subject.  
Inflammatory lesions  are defined as follows:  
Papule: An erythematous, raised, palpable lesion less than 5 mm in diameter  
Pustule: An erythematous, raised, likely palpable lesion containing white exudate or pus less than 5 mm in 
diameter  
Nodule: A deep -seated, erythematous, firm lesion greater than 5 mm in diameter  
Non-inflammatory  lesions  are defined as follows:

 Open comedone (blackhead): A widely dilated sebaceous follicle plugged with darkly pigmented sebum  
Closed comedone (whitehead): A small, closed sebaceous follicle distended with sebum, with a white 
appearance  
 
Evaluator’s Global Severity Score (EGSS)  
At ea ch visit , the severity will be determined based on evaluator- blinded evaluations of the signs and 
symptoms of acne vulgaris. Every effort should be made to have the same evaluator assess the same 
subject at each visit. If this is not possible, the same eva luator should assess the subject at both the 
Baseline and Week 12 visits. Evaluations will be scored on a scale of 0 -4, with 0 being clear and 4 being 
severe. Please see the table below for complete definitions.  The EGSS should always be completed prior 
to the lesion counts . 
Score  Grade  Description  
0 Clear  Normal, clear skin with no evidence of acne vulgaris  
1 Almost clear  Rare non-inflammatory  lesions present, with rare non -inflamed papules (papules must 
be resolving and may be hyperpigmented, though not pink -red) 
2 Mild  Some non-inflammatory  lesions are present, with few inflammatory lesions 
(papules/pustules only; no nodulocystic lesions)  
3 Moderate  Non-inflammatory  lesions predominate, with multiple inflammatory lesions evident: 
several to many comedones and papules/pustules, and there may or may not be 
1 nodulocystic lesion  
4 Severe  Inflammatory lesions are more apparent, many comedones a nd papules/pustules, there 
may or may not be up to 2 nodulocystic lesions  
 
Safety Measurements:  
Safety evaluations will include the following:  
• The percent of subjects who experience a cutaneous reaction (erythema, scaling, 
hypo/hyper -pigmentation, itching, burning, or stinging) graded at a level of 3 at any point in 
the study following the first application of study drug.  
• The percent of subjects who experience a cutaneous adverse event (AE) irrespective of severity grade at any point in the study fo llowing the first application of study drug.  
• Changes from baseline in all safety laboratory values and vital sign measurements as summarized using descriptive statistics by treatment group and study visit.  
• Subjects will be assessed for the occurrence of ne w and ongoing AEs.  
Cutaneous safety and tolerability will be evaluated by tabulations of AEs and Cutaneous Safety and 
Tolerability Evaluation scores (scaling, erythema, hypo/hyper- pigmentation, itching, burning, and 
stinging) to be assessed at each study visit.  Itching, burning and stinging (cutaneous tolerability) will be 
reviewed with the subject at each study visit as an average over the period since the previous visit. 
Scaling, erythema, and hypo/hyper -pigmentation (cutaneous safety) will be assessed by the evaluator at 
each visit. Cutaneous tolerability signs and symptoms that result in the subject requiring a concomitant therapy, interruption of treatment, or discontinuation from the study will be reported as an AE.

 Statistical Methods  
All statistic al processing will be performed using SAS® version 9.3 or later unless otherwise stated.  
Statistical significance will be based on two -tailed tests of the null hypothesis resulting in p -values of 0.05 
or less. Tests of lesion count superiority will be bas ed on an ANCOVA with factors of treatment and 
analysis center and the respective Baseline lesion count as a covariate or on ranked data submitted to an 
ANCOVA with factors of treatment and analysis center and the respective Baseline lesion count as a covar iate. The co -primary analysis of the dichotomized EGSS will be based on logistic regression with 
factors of treatment group and analysis center. The primary method of handling missing efficacy data will be based on estimation using the method of Markov Cha in Monte Carlo (MCMC) imputation.  
Additionally, a model -based multiple imputation process will be used as a sensitivity analysis to the 
MCMC imputation. The absolute change in lesion count will also be analyzed using a repeated measures ANCOVA for lesion count data or repeated measures logistic regression model (generalized estimating equations) for the dichotomized EGSS. Finally, a tipping point analysis will be performed for the primary endpoints.     
Inflammatory and non -inflammatory lesion counts will be recorded for each Subject at Baseline and at 
Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12. The absolute and percent change from Baseline in inflammatory and non -
inflammatory lesions will be derived for each Subject at Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12.  
The EGSS will be recorded for each  Subject. The EGSS will be dichotomized into “success” and “failure” 
with a Subject considered a success if the Evaluator’s Global Severity Score at Week 2, 4, 8, and 12 is at 
least 2 grades less than baseline and Clear or Almost Clear.  
Populations Analyzed:  
An intent -to-treat (ITT) analysis will be conducted. The ITT population will consist of all randomized 
subjects who received study drug.  
All subjects who are randomized and receive at least 1 confirmed dose of study drug will be included in 
the safety population . A per -protocol (PP) analysis will also be conducted. Subjects will be eligible for the 
PP analysis if they complete the 12 -week evaluation without noteworthy study protocol violations ( i.e., 
any subject or investigator activity that could  have possibly interfered with the therapeutic administration 
of the treatment or the precise evaluation of treatment efficacy). The PP population will include subjects 
in the ITT population who do not meet any of the following criteria: 
• Failed any of the inclusion/exclusion criteria.  
• Have taken any interfering concomitant medications.  
• Did not attend the Week 12 visit,.  
• Missed more than 1 post baseline study visit prior to Week 12 
• Have not been compliant with the dosing regimen (i.e., subjects may not miss more than 5 consecutive days of dosing and must take 80% -120% of expected doses). The number of expected 
doses will be determined for each subject based on the length of their participation in the study.  
• Out of visit window at the Week 12 visit.  
Subjects who discontinue from the study due to an adverse event related to study treatment or documented 
lack of treatment effect (and/or worsening of condition)
 will be included in the PP population. Prior to 
breaking the blind, other additional criteria may be added to the list to accommodate for unforeseen events that occurred during the conduct of the trial that result in noteworthy study protocol violations.  
Approximately 180 subjects  with moderate or severe acne will be  enrolled and randomized to  the 
follow ing treatment groups:  
• 120 s ubjects to receive IDP-126 Gel, once -daily application  
• 60 subjects to receive IDP -126 Vehicle Gel, once -daily application  
Subject demographic and baseline characteristics will be summarized by treatment group using descriptive 
statistics for the ITT, PP, and Safety analysis sets.

 Efficacy  Evaluation : 
Primary efficacy  analyses will be conducted on the ITT (primary) and PP (supportive) populations.   
Secondary and supportive analyses will be conducted on the ITT population.   
Primary:  
Co-primary efficacy analyses include  the absolute change  from baseline  in inflammatory and in non -
inflammatory lesions, and the dichotomized Evaluator’s Global Severity Score.  The pre -specified time 
point will be Week 12. All of the testing relating to the analysis of inflammatory and non -inflammatory 
lesions will use the methods introduced in Section 1 2. 
Secondary:  
Secondary efficacy endpoints include percent change in inflammatory and non -inflammatory lesion 
counts from baseline  to Weeks 12, 8 and 4 and also percentage of subjects with at least a two grade 
improvement in the Evaluator’s G lobal Severity Score from baseline to Week 12.  
Supportive:  
Additional supportive efficacy endpoints includ e percent change in inflammatory and non -inflammatory 
lesions counts from B aseline at Week 2 , as well as p ercentage of subjects with at least a two grade 
improvement in the Evaluator’s Global Severity Score from baseline at Weeks 2,  4, and 8. 
Safety Evaluation:  
All subjects who receive medication and are confirmed to have dosed at least once will constitute the 
safety population. Safety will be evaluated by tabulations of AEs, Cutaneous Safety and Tolerability 
Evaluations, vital signs/abbreviated physical examinations, and safety laboratory results.  
Cutaneous Safety and Tolerability  Evaluatio n scores (erythema, scaling, hypo/hyper -pigmentation, 
itching, burning, and stinging) will be presented with descriptive statistics at baseline and at Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12 for each treatment group. Frequencies and percentages for each outcome category will be included in these statistics. Mean values will be presented graphically by week and treatment group.  
Vital sign measurements, an abbreviated physical examination, and safety laboratory results will be 
conducted on all subjects at specified visits. For pre-menses females and FOCBP, urine pregnancy  and 
serum pregnancy  testing will occur at specified visits. Changes from baseline in safety laboratory values 
and vital sign measurements will be summarized with descriptive statistics for each treatment group at all 
applicable study visits. Shift tables will be presented for changes in safety laboratory values to summarize 
laboratory test results collected at Baseline  and Week 12. Normal ranges established by the central 
laboratory will be used to determine the shifts. A listing of all out- of-range laboratory test results at any 
assessment time point will also be provided.  
Determination of clinical significance for all out -of-range laboratory values will be made by each 
investigator and included in the listing. In addition, a listing of all clinically significant laboratory test results will be provided.  
All previous and concomitant medications will be classified based on terminology from the World Health 
Organization Drug Dictionary. Previous therapies and concomitant medications data will be presented in the data listings.  
All AEs occurring during the study will be recorde d and classified using the Medical Dictionary for 
Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) terminology. Descriptions of AEs will include the date of onset, the date the AE ended, the severity of the AE, the relationship to study drug, the action taken regarding study drug  
usage, the action taken to treat the AE, and the outcome. Adverse events will be summarized by treatment 
group and severity. Each subject will be counted only once within a system organ class or a preferred term 
by using the AEs with the highest severity within each category.  
Adverse events will be summarized by treatment group and relationship to study drug. Each subject will be counted only once within a system organ class or a preferred term by using the AEs with the greatest relationship within e ach category.

 The percentage of subjects reporting AEs will be summarized by treatment group for AEs occurring in at 
least 5% of subjects (either treatment group). The percentage of subjects for each treatment group will be compared using a Fisher’s Exact test.  All information pertaining to AEs noted during the study will be 
listed by subject, detailing the verbatim descriptions given by the investigator, preferred term, system organ class, start date, stop date, severity, actions taken, and drug relatednes s. The AE onset will also be 
shown relative (in number of days) to the day of initial dose of the randomized study drug . 
Serious adverse events (SAEs) will be tabulated by subject within treatment groups.  
In addition, a list of subjects who discontinued f rom the study and a list of subjects who experienced 
SAEs will also be provided.  
Subject Self -Assessments

 5 Introduction  
Acne is a very common disorder of sebaceous follicles that is most prevalent among 
teenagers, usually triggered by the increase in androgen production occurring at puberty (Krakowski 2008) . Although acne generally resolves by the age of 25, approximately 3% to 
8% of adults 25 to 44 years of age present with acne ( Goodman 2006, White 1998) . The 
pathogenesis is complex and appears to involve 4 primary features: stimulation of sebum gland acti vity, bacterial proliferation (especially Propionibacterium acnes), abnormal 
follicular hyperkeratinization and resultant obstruction of the sebaceous follicles, and the release of inflammatory mediators ( Thiboutot 2009) . These changes in acne patients result in 
the formation of clinical inflammatory lesions including superficial pustules such as comedones (popularly known as “blackheads” or “whiteheads”) and more deeply located papules, nodules, and cysts ( Krakowski 2008) . The areas most affected by the disease include 
the pilosebaceous follicles of the head and upper trunk, where the sebaceous glands are particularly active ( Webster 2002) . 
Given the complexity of the pathogenic mechanisms that lead to acne, for maximum efficacy, consensus guidelines recommend the use of combination therapy consisting of medications with different, but complementary, mechanisms of action ( Thiboutot 2009) . In 
particular, the guideline s advocate the use of a retinoid and an antibiotic (eg, clindamycin 
phosphate) or antibacterial (eg, benzoyl peroxide [ BPO ]) as first -line and maintenance 
therapy in patients with both inflammatory and non- inflammatory  lesions ( Ghali 2009, 
Thiboutot 2009) .  
Although antibiotics like clindamycin were among the first effective treatments for acne, recent acne management guidelines discourage the use of antibiotics as monotherapy due to the development of bacterial resistance ( Nast 2012 , Thiboutot 2009) . The guidelines also 
recommend limiting both the frequency and duration of antibiotic use for acne, and to use antibiotics in conjunction with BPO to minimize the development of resistance at sites of application ( Thiboutot 2009) . Topically applied BPO is keratolytic, comedolytic, and 
anti-inflammatory, and  has bactericidal activity against Propionibacterium acnes  (Gollnick 
2003, Harper 2010, Tanghetti 2009) . To date, there is no evidence of P acnes  resistance to 
BPO ( Harper 2010 ). Further, the combination of BPO with chemical s tructures that contain a 
tertiary amine within their structure, such as clindamycin, increases the generation of BPO radicals and thereby creates a real biologic synergism ( Burkhart 2008)  that contributes to 
their complementary effects on acne pathogenesis.  
Retinoids (eg, adapalene, tretinoin, tazarotene) are anticomedogenic, anti -inflammatory, and 
inhibit microcomedone formation ( Ghali 2009, Zaenglein 2008) . Topical, daily retinoid 
monotherapy is used to inhibit the formation of comedones and usually clear even severe comedonal acne within a few months ( Shalita 2001) . Adapalene, a synthetic retinoid, is a

 naphthoi c acid derivative with retinoid -like properties. In the cell, adapalene can bind 
specifically to retinoic acid nuclear (and not cytosolic) receptors to exert its effects 
(Zaenglein 2008) . Biochemical and pharmacological profile studies  have demonstrated that 
adapalene is a modulator of cellular differentiation, keratinization, and inflammatory processes (Piskin 2007) . Topical formul ations of adapalene have been used to treat acne in 
the United States (US) for more than 20 years. 
Retinoids have also been paired with antibiotic/BPO fixed-dose combination products 
(Bowman 2005, Del Rosso 2007, Kircik 2007, Tanghetti 2006)  and, consistently across 
studies of these products, regimens t hat included a topical retinoid were more effective than 
regimens that did not ( Thiboutot 2009) . Adapalene (0.1% gel and cream formulations) has a 
lower  irritation potential relative to other retinoids ( Dosik 2005a , Dosik 2005b)  and is 
therefore well suited for use in combination topical regimens, particularly those containing BPO, which is also potentially irritating (Del Rosso 2007) .  
Thus, treatment with a combination of topical clindamycin phosphate, BPO, and adapa lene 
can be expected to provide optimal overlapping benefits for maximal efficacy: each of these agents has some degree of anti -inflammatory activity; both the antibiotic and BPO decrease 
P acnes  proliferation ( Weiss 2004) ; BPO is also keratolytic ( Harper 2010) ; and adapalene 
additionally regulates keratinization ( Zaenglein 2008 ).  
A fixed -dose combination treatment is optimal to enhance patient adherence due to 
simplified application regimens (eg, once daily versus sequential morning/evening administration  of each active agent ) and also to preclude substance incompatibilities due to 
application errors (eg, oxidation by using incompatible single agents) (Thielitz 2013) . Of 
note, when an adapalene 0.1% gel and a clindamycin 1.2%/BPO 5% fixed-dose combination gel were combined in equal amounts by weight, there was no resultant instability of any of the active components for up to 24 hours ( Bikowski 2006) .  
The current study is intended to evaluate the safety and efficacy of IDP-126 Gel , a novel 
fixed -dose combination of clindamycin phosphate, BPO, and adapalene (1.2 %/3.1%/0.15%), 
relative to its vehicle for the treatment of acne vulgaris in subjects 9 years of age and older.

 6 Study Objectives and Purpose   
The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of once daily  
application of IDP-126 Gel  compared with vehicle  (IDP -126 Vehicle Gel) in subjects with 
moderate to severe acne vulgaris.  
7 Investigational Plan 
7.1 Overall Study Design and Plan: Description 
This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled, parallel -group study 
designed to assess the safety , efficacy and tolerability of IDP-126 Gel in comparison with 
vehicle gel. To be eligible for the study, subjects must be at least  9 years of age or older , and 
have a clinical diagnosis of moderate to severe acne vulgaris ( a score of 3  or 4 [moderate to 
severe] on the Evaluator’s Global Severity Scale [ EGSS ]), presenting with 30-100 
inflammatory  facial lesions (papules, pustules, and nodules), 35-150 non- inflammatory  facial 
lesions (open and closed comedones), and ≤  2 facial nodules.  
Approximately 180 subjects will be enrolled into this study and randomized into 1 of 
2 treatment groups  in a 2:1  ratio:  
• 120 subjects to receive IDP-126 Gel , once daily  application  
• 60 subjects  to receive IDP-126 Vehicle Gel , once daily  application  
Subjects will be enrolled at approximately  15 independent study centers. The duration of 
treatment will be 12 weeks. Subjects will be evaluated at Screening, Baseline, and at subsequent follow-up visits (Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12). 
An interactive web based Interactive R esponse Technology (IRT) will be employed to 
facilitate randomization of study subjects. Treatment assignments and study drug kit numbers 
will be ge nerated centrally by the IRT. At each study  center , subject numbers will be 
assigned consecutively at the Screening visit , starting with 001. 
The assigned study drug will be applied topically to the face once daily  at home, in the 
evening,  for 12 weeks  (up to the evening prior to the Week 12 visit), with the exception of 
study visit days (Baseline, Week 2, 4 and 8) where study drug will be applied (also by the subject) after the study visit is completed, at the investigational center . The initial applicatio n 
will be done at the investigational center  as per instruction from the study coordinator or 
designee. The subjects will be instructed to avoid exposure to direct sunlight in order to prevent sunburn. Use of sunscreens with at least a sun protection factor (SPF) of 15 and protective clothing ( eg, a hat)  is recommended when exposure cannot be avoided. Subjects 
will apply their daily treatments at home as explained by the study coordinator or designee at each study center. During post baseline study visits (Weeks 2, 4, 8 and 12), the subjects will be asked to return the ir used pumps of study drug and will be dispensed new pumps of study

 drug ( new pumps dispensed on Weeks 4 and 8 only ; Week 2 will have no new study drug 
dispensed; and Week 12 will be final visit) . During the study, each subject will only be 
permitted to use approved, non- medicated  cleansers , moisturizers , and sunscreens . 
During the study, s ubjects will be asked to complete the  Acne -Specific Quality of Life 
questionna ire (Acne-QoL, Appendix  17.3). The Investigator assessments (EGSS, lesion 
counts) will be conducted independently of this  subject self -assessment . The EGSS should be 
completed prior to the lesion counts.  The Acne -QoL questionnaire will be completed at 
Baseline and Week 12 . Inferential statistical analyse s will not be performed on the 
questionnaire; the subjective responses will be compared between treatment groups for 
trends. Information on reported and observed adverse events (AEs) will be obtained at each visit. An abbreviated physical examination, along with vital sign measurements , will be 
performed at Baseline and Week 12 (end of study , final visit) for all subjects . 
Blood samples will be collected from subjects at Baseline and Week 12 for CBC/Diff and 
serum chemistry.  For all female subjects of childbearing potential (FOCBP) , urine 
pregnancy testing will be performed at Screening, confirmed at prior to randomization at 
Baseline, and then repeated at Weeks 2, 4, 8 and 12. Serum pregnancy test will also be 
conducted at Baseline and Week 12. 
Subjects who terminate their study participation early will be asked to complete all Week 12 assessments, as appropriate. Subjects who discontinue from the study during the treatment period will not be replaced.

26 • When the requirements of the protocol are not followed. 
• When a concomitant therapy likely to interfere with the results of the study is 
reported  or required by the subject (the investigators will report all such information 
on the source documents/e CRFs  and decide, in accordance with the Sponsor, whether 
the subject is to be withdrawn). 
• When a subject is lost to follow-up. The investigators will try twice to reach the subject by telephone , email and/or text message,  and will send a follow- up letter by 
certified mail before considering that the s ubject is lost to follow -up. These actions 
will be reported on the End of Study source documents and the fi nal e CRF and a copy 
of the follow- up letter will be maintained in the investigator’s file.  
All premature discontinuations and their associated reasons must be carefully documented by the 
investigator on source documents and the final eCRF, and, if need be, on the AE form. In any 
case, no subject who has been included and has a n assigned  study number can be replaced by 
another if the subject discontinues pr ematurely for whatever reason.  All data gathered on the 
subject prior to termination will be made available to the Sponsor. 
Reasons for study completion/discontinuation as listed on the f inal r eport form are defined as 
follows: 
Normal Study Completion  – Subject completes the study as planned in the protocol. 
Adverse Event  – Complete an AE form.  
Death – Complete a serious adverse event (SAE)  form.  
Subject Request  – Consent withdrawal, subject moved, schedule conflicts. 
Protocol Violation  – Contact the Sponsor or designee before making decision. 
Lost to Follow- Up – Document with 2 phone calls, emails and/or text messages,  and a 
certified letter.  
Pregnancy  – Subject will discontinue study drug immediately, but will be followed to term. 
Complete a pregnancy form.  
Worsening Condition  – Subject requires alternate treatment for acne before the end of the 
study and the investigator determines it is not due to lack of efficacy.  
Lack of Efficacy  – Subject requires alternate treatment for acne after at least 2 weeks of 
study drug treatment and the risk of continuing the subject in the study outweighs the benefit 
as det ermined by the investigator.  
Withdrawal by Parent/Guardian – An indication that the study participant has been 
removed from the study by the parent or legal guardian; includes consent withdrawal, subject moves, schedule conflicts, etc.  
Study Terminated by Sponsor – An indication that a clinical study was stopped by its Sponsor. 
Other – Specify in the comments section of the e CRF.

27 Subjects who terminate study drug early will be asked to complete all Week 12 assessments and 
procedures prior to commencement of any alternative therapy for acne (if possible). Subjects 
who discontinue from the study during the treatment period will not be replaced. 
All subjects are free to withdraw from participating in this study at any time and for whatever 
reason, specified or unspecified, and without prejudice. No constraints will be placed on ordinary subject management, and subjects, when appropriate, will be placed on other conventional therapy upon request or whenever clinically necessary as determined by their physician. 
9 Treatment  Plan  
9.1 Methods of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups  
This is a double-blind study in which the identity of the study drug will be unknown to the investigator/evaluator and all subjects, as well as all individuals closely associated with the study.  
Eligible s ubjects will be randomized to 1 of the 2 study drug groups in a ratio of 2:1 ( IDP-126 
Gel : IDP-126 Vehicle Gel ).  
The study center will assign e ach screened subject a unique 6-digit study subject number. The 
number will consist of the 3 -digit study center number (pre -assigned by S pons or/designee) and 
the 3 -digit chronological screening number, starting with 001 (eg, 101001, 101002). The  
randomization system will assign the study drug kit to subjects based on a randomization code ; 
the kit will be dispen sed to the subjects at Baseline and Weeks 4 and 8 by the study center staff . 
A study drug log will document the inventory, dispensing , and collecting  of study drug at each 
study center.  
9.2 Randomization and Blinding  
The study drugs will be packaged and labeled identically, and the study drug kits will be numbered sequentially and dispensed randomly to the subjects entering the study within each study center . Study drug supplies will be distributed to the study center s to maintain the 
randomization ratio within each study center .  
As a double-blind study, the investigators /evaluators , the study center  staff, the Sponsor, and the 
clinical monitors will not be aware of the treatment assigned to the individual study subjec ts. 
Delegated staff members at each study center  will dispense the study drugs and will collect all 
used and unused study drug pumps as scheduled.  
9.3 Unblinding  
The treatment assignments for all enrolled subjects will be unblinded only after the conclusion of the study. Specifically, the blind will be broken only after all data are entered into the database, verified, and validated; subject evaluability assessments are performed and the database is locked. 
Protocol V01- 126A -301           Bausc h Health  
 
 
Version 1.0, 14 October 2019   CONFIDENTIAL  
28 In the case of a medical emergency, the investigator can break the blind for the subject involved, 
preferably by first discussing the situation with the m edical monitor and the Sponsor (or 
designee) immediately. After confirmation, the investigator will be contacted with unblinding information by a Sponsor r epresentative. The investigator will record the code break in the 
subject’s source documents. 
9.4 Prior and Prohibited Concomitant Medication or Therapy  
Any concomitant medication or therapy stopped for washout as indicated below is to be 
recorded. As noted in the exclusion criteria, there are mandatory washout periods and restrictions 
during the study for the following topical treatments/physical treatments  on the face that have a 
known beneficial effect for acne vulgaris:  
Topical astringents and abrasives on the face  1 week  
Non-allowed moisturizers or sunscreens on the face  1 week  
Antibiotics on the fac e 2 weeks  
Other topical anti -acne drugs on the face  2 weeks  
Soaps containing antimicrobials on the face  2 weeks  
Anti-inflammatory agents and corticosteroids on 
the fac e 4 weeks  
Retinoids, including retinol on the face  4 weeks  
Chemical peel/Microdermabrasion on the face  4 weeks  
Light ( e.g. LED , PDT ) therapy on the face  4 weeks  
Acne surgery  4 weeks  
Laser therapy on the face  4 weeks  
 
If the subject requires topical treatment for acne on areas other than the face,  the investigator 
may prescribe a product that does not contain adapalene, clindamycin phosphate,  or BPO. Any 
such medications must be noted in source documents and the eCRF.  
In addition, there is a mandatory washout period and restriction on use during the study for the 
following systemic drugs: 
Corticosteroids (including intramuscular injections ; 
inhaled corticosteroids are allowed)  4 weeks  
Antibiotics  4 weeks  
Other systemic acne treatments  4 weeks  
Systemic retinoids  6 months  
 
Subjects using concomitant therapies during the course of the study that could interfere with the interpretation of the study results (including, but not limited to , those listed above) should not be 
withdrawn, but the use of the concomitant product should be discontinued. Examples of products/procedures that are prohibited during the course of the study include (but not limited to) acne surgery, use of comedone removal strips, and use of comedogenic products (makeup, shaving products). With the exception of the study drug and the treatments listed  above, no other 
topical/physical  treatment for acne will be permitted.  
Protocol V01- 126A -301           Bausc h Health  
 
 
Version 1.0, 14 October 2019   CONFIDENTIAL  
29 Information on concomitant medications or therapies  will be recorded in the Prior and 
Concomitant Medication or Therapy source document and eCRF . Any therapy used by the 
subject will be considered concomitant therapy (e.g., facial procedures, surgical procedures, 
investigations, and operations), and any medication, both over-the- counter (OTC) or 
prescription, used by the subject will be considered concomitant medication (eg,  aspirin, Tylenol, 
birth control pills, vitamins). Every attempt should be made to keep concomitant medication / 
therapy dosing constant during the study. Any change to concomitant medication / therapy should be noted on the Concomitant T herapy or Medication source document and e CRF.  
All cleansers , moisturizers , sunscreens, and other topical products used on the treatment area that 
are no t medicated  will be captured on the Prior and Concomitant Therapy source document and 
eCRF. Subjects must use investigator-approved, non- medicated  cleansers , moisturizers , and 
sunscreens . 
Subjects should avoid excessive ultraviolet ( UV) exposure by such activities as sun bathing or 
tanning booths. Use of  sunscreens with at least SPF 15 and protective clothing during the day 
(eg, a  hat) are recommended when exposure cannot be avoided.  
9.5 Treatment Compliance  
Each subject will be instructed on the importance of returning his or her study drug at each applicable study visit. If a subject does not return his or her study drug at a particular study visit, he or she will be instructed to return it as soon as possible. The subjects will bring the pump(s) dispensed at each specified study visit to the next subsequent study visit. Each pump will be weighed on a calibrated scale (with the cap on, and to the nearest tenth  of a gram ) by a study 
coordinator or designee prior to dispensing and after collecting . The subject will also be asked to 
complete a diary calendar and will be questioned regarding study drug use since the previous visit in order to judge the subject’s compliance with applying the study drug. A subject who deviates meaningfully  from th e prescribed applic ation amount will be counseled. Any missed 
applications of study drug will be noted by the subject on the diary, which will be collected and placed  in the appropriate source document. Missed applications will be documented in the e CRF.   
9.6 Protocol Deviations and Violations 
The investigators must read the protocol thoroughly and must follow the instructions exactly. 
A deviation from the protocol is an unintended and/or unanticipated departure from the 
procedures an d/or processes approved by the S ponsor and the Institutional Review Board 
(IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC)  and agreed to by the investigator. Deviations usually 
have an impact on individual subjects  or a small group of subjects  and do not involve 
inclusion/exclusion or primary endpoint criteria. 
A protocol violation occurs when there is non- adherence to the protocol that results in a 
substantial, additional risk to the subject, when the subject or investigator has failed to adhere to 
Protocol V01- 126A -301           Bausc h Health  
 
 
Version 1.0, 14 October 2019   CONFIDENTIAL  
30 critical  protocol requirements ( eg, inclusion/exclusion criteria) and the subjec t was enrolled 
without prior Sponsor approval, or when there is non-adherence to FDA regulations and/or ICH 
GCP  guidelines. 
The investigator or designee must document and explain in the subject’s  source documentation 
any deviation from the approved protocol. The investigator may implement a deviation or protocol change to eliminate an immediate hazard to a study subject  without prior IRB/IEC 
approval. As soon as possible after such an occurrence, the implemented deviation or change, the reasons for it, and any proposed protocol amendment(s) to prevent future occurrences,  should be 
submitted to the IRB/IEC f or review and approval, to the Sponsor for agreement, and to the 
regulatory authorities, if required.

10.1.1 Packaging and Labeling 
IDP-126 Gel and IDP-126 Vehicle Gel  will be supplied in subject kits. Instructions will be 
provided to the designated study drug technician at each  study center . When a subject is 
randomized into the study, the IRT-specified  kit number will be assigned to be used for that 
randomized subject. Each subject kit will contain one pump, containing 50 g of study material. 
One pump will be dispensed to the subject at each dispensing visit: Baseline, Week 4 , and Week 
8. Each pump will be weighed on a calibrated scale, prior to dispensing (with the cap on, and to the nearest tenth  of a gram ). After weighing the pump and prior to first use of the study drug 
pump, the pump will need to be actuat ed approximately  10 times until the gel begins to dispense.  
The pump is actuated by depressing the pump head using one or two fingers. This is to remove the air from the p ump prior to product dispensing and is known as “priming the pump”. Priming 
the pump must occur at each dispensing visit (or if/when a replacement pump is issued).  
The s ubject will bring the pump to the next study visit (Week 2) , where it will be collected and  
weighed  (with the cap on, and to the nearest tenth of a gram ) – a new pump wil l not  be 
dispensed at this visit, and the original pump will be returned to the subject. The subject will then bring the same pump to the subsequent study visit (Week 4), where it will be collected and weighed (with the cap on) to the nearest 0.1 gram ; one new pump will be dispensed again by the 
IRT at Week 4, weighed (with the cap on) to the nearest 0.1 gram  and provided to the subject. 
The same will occur at the Week 8 visit. If the subject loses a pump (lost or damaged pump), another kit will be dispensed via IRT under an unscheduled visit. When weighing the subject’s returned pump, if the cap is missing, a cap should be borrowed from another pump for weighing purposes; after weighing the pump with the borrowed cap, the cap should be returned to its

Version 1.0, 14 October 2019   CONFIDENTIAL  
32 origi nal pump. All used and unused study drug pumps will be collected and weighed at the final 
study visit (Week 12). All dispensing and collecting of study drug pumps will be documented on 
the study drug accountability log .  
Each subject kit (and pump) label  will have a double panel. Labels may contain , at a minimum,  
the following information: 
• Protocol Number 
• Kit Number  
• Contents 
• Instruction s for use  
• Space for entry of subject number 
• Space for entry of date dispensed  
• The sponsor name, Bausch Health Americas, Inc. 
• The quantity of product (50 g) 
• A statement reading, “For external use only; a void contact with eyes and lips” 
• A statement reading, “Store  at 2-8 °C (36-46 °F) prior to dispensing. Once dispensed, 
the product should be stored at room temperature up to 25°C (77°F) and assigned a 5-
week use by date. Do not freeze. ” 
• A statement reading, “Caution: New Drug Limited by Federal Law to Investigational Use”  
As we intend to have sites in regions outside the US, additional information may be included on the labels  as necessary  per a specific regions local requirements . 
10.1.2 Storage, Handling, and Disposal of Study Drug  
At the investigational center, the study drug should be stored at 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F), and should not be frozen . Once opened  and dispensed to the s ubject , the study drug should be stored 
at room temperature up to 25°C (77°F). All empty, partially used and unused study drug will be returned  to the Sponsor or designee upon study completion of the study for documented disposal. 
10.1.3 Administration  
The study drug  will be applied topically to t he face once daily  at home in the evening , at least 30 
minutes before bedtime , for a period of 12 weeks, with the exception of study visit days 
(Baseline, Week  2, 4, and 8) where study drug will be applied by the subject after the study visit 
is completed at the investigational center . The study drug will be applied as a thin coating that is 
gently rubbed into the skin. Study drug use will be limited to the face.  
The investigator and/or trained study center  staff member wi ll instruct the subject on the proper 
study drug application procedure during  the Baseline visit (see Appendix  17.1) . All subjects will 
be instructed to apply the study drug at approximately the same time every day for 12 weeks , 
Protocol V01- 126A -301           Bausc h Health  
 
 
Version 1.0, 14 October 2019   CONFIDENTIAL  
33 after cleansing  with an investigator -approved cleanser. On study visit days (B aseline, Weeks 2, 
4, and 8) subjects should be instructed to wait until the end of their study visit to apply study 
medication at the investigational site ( Note: T his will affect evening application times on study 
visit days, which is acceptable. Subjects should not apply another dose of study drug in the evening on the study visit days). No time interval between dosing and meals or any other activity is specified. S tudy center  personnel oversight of a subject’s  on-site application of study drug is 
required  at Baseline, Week 4 and Week 8, to ensure training /reinforcement  of proper application 
technique.  
During daily application, s ubjects will be instructed to gently wash their face s with a n 
investigator-approved, non- medicated  cleanser and warm (not hot) water. After washing, the 
subjects will be asked to thoroughly rinse and gently pat their faces dry. The subjects should use 
the pump to dispense one pea size amount of the study drug onto the fingertip.  The study drug gel should be dotted onto 6 areas  of the face: the chin, left cheek, right cheek, nose, left forehead, 
and right forehead. After distributing the gel in this manner, the subject should gently rub the gel 
into the skin. This amount of drug should be sufficient to cover the entire face excluding the mouth, eyes, inside the nose, and lips. It is important for the subject to treat their entire face (excluding the mouth, eyes and lips) and they should be instructed NOT to treat only specific lesions. The subjects  should gently smooth the study drug over the face evenly. The study drug 
should become invisible almost immediately following application with gentle rubbing. If this does not happen, the investigator should instruct the subject on the use of a smaller dosage. The subject should wash his/her hands after applying the study drug to the face.  Subjects should also 
be instructed to place the cap back onto the pump after every use. 
At each study visit, study staff will review the subject instructions for application of study drug 
to ensure proper use and compliance with application. The subjects will be instructed to continue using the same i nvestigator -approved, non- medicated  facial cleanser , moisturizer , and sunscreen, 
and not to change products during the study. At each visit, subjects are to be asked if they have changed their cleansing routine. Facial makeup may be applied according to the subject’s normal 
daily routine; however, subjects should be instructed not to wear makeup during study visits as it 
may interfere with the evaluator’s assessments. Subjects must also agree to use non -
comedogenic makeup during the study if they use makeup. No other products should be used on the face.  Subjects should be instructed to minimize sun exposure and to use investigator-
approved, non- medicated  sunscreens of at least SPF 15 and to wear protective clothing during 
the day ( eg, a hat)  if exposure cannot be avoided.  
Subjects should be instructed to store the study drug at room te mperature.  If a subject loses or 
misplaces the pump cap at any point during the study, the subject should contact the study center  
to return the exposed pump and receive a replace ment  pump.

34 10.2 Study Drug Accountability  
Upon receipt of the study drug, the investigator is responsible for ensuring that the designated 
study center  staff member will conduct a complete inventory of the study drugs and assume 
responsibility for their appropriate storage and dispensing. In accordance with federal 
regulations, the investigators must agree to keep all study drugs  in a secure location with 
restricted access. The i nvestigator will keep a record of the inventory, dispensing, and collecting 
of all study drugs . This record will be made available to the Sponsor’s monitor for the purpose of 
accounting for all study drugs . Any significant discrepancy and/or deficiency must be recorded 
with an explanation. 
All supplies sent to the investigators will be accounted for and, in no case, used in any 
unauthorized situation. Pumps will be weighed on a calibrated scale (with the cap on, and to the 
nearest tenth  of a gram ) before dispensing to and upon return by the subjects, and weights will be 
recorded on the pharmacy log and appropriate eCRF. All used and unused supplies will be returned to Sponsor/designee for destruction at the conclusion of the study. If a subject 
loses/misplaces a cap, the pump should still be weighed using a cap from another pump/kit.  
11 Study Procedures and Evaluations  
All subject information and data obtained during the study visits will be recorded in the source documents, applicable study logs, and e CRFs . 
Evaluators must have appropriate, documented experience and training, or obtain approval from the S ponsor based on experience (or through additional training organized by the Sponsor). 
At each study visit, every attempt should be made to ensure that the same investigator/evaluator assesses the same subject.   
11.1 Schedule of Evaluations and Procedures  
11.1.1 Visit 1: Screening Vi sit (Day −35 to Day 0) 
The following procedures will be conducted at this visit: 
1. Obtain written informed consent prior to performing any study procedures. Subjects 
less than the age of consent must sign an assent form, and the parent or legal guardian must sign the informed consent form. 
2. Assign the subject a 6-digit subject number by accessing  IRT. The number will consist 
of the 3- digit study center number (pre -assigned to your study center ) and the 3- digit 
sequential  order screening number assigned by IRT (eg,  101001, 101002; in this 
example study center  number is 101).  
3. Record the subject’ s demographic information. 
4. Record the subject’ s medical history.

(past 6 months for systemic retinoids). Record any therapies that will be used 
concomitantly during the study.  
6. Perform an abbreviated physical examination, including height and weight, and measure vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, respiration rate, and oral temperature).  
Note: height will only be measured at Screening, and not at subsequent study visits.  
7. Assess the subject using  the EGSS, followed by inflammatory and  non- inflammatory  
lesion counting to determine eligibility .  
8. Perform a urine pregnancy test for all females who  are premenses  and FOCBP . The 
urine pregnancy tests will be supplied by the CRO/designee.  
9. Verify that the subject meets the applicable inclusion/exclusion criteria as outlined in Sections  8.1 and 8.2.  
10. Discuss allowed cleansers, moisturizers , and sunscreens, and record any cleanser, 
moisturizer , and sunscreen use (Appendix  17.2).  
11. If subject wears makeup, remind the subject not to wear makeup during any future 
visits . 
12. If the subject requires a washout, schedule the Baseline visit to occur after the washout 
is complete. If no washout is required, the Screening and Baseline visits may occur on

11.2 Evaluation of Efficacy 
The determination of efficacy will be based on evaluator -blinded assessments of the signs and 
symptoms of acne vulgaris. Evaluators must be a board- certified/board -eligible dermatologist or 
have appropriate documented experience and training, and be presen t for formal study training 
and validation at the Investigator Meeting (and/or Site Initiation Visit), or obtain a waiver from 
the Sponsor based on experience (or through additional training organized by the Sponsor).  
The EGSS assessments and lesion counts will be performed at each study visit. The EGSS 
assessments will be collected before  the lesion counts. All s ubject assessments will be performed 
by a trained and validated evaluator. Every effort should be made to have the same evaluator assess the same  subject at each visit. If this is not possible, the same evaluator should assess the 
subject at both the Baseline and Week 12 visits.  
11.2.1 Evaluator’s Global Severity Score 
The EGSS will be a static assessment that is independent of the baseline score. The in vestigator 
will make the asses sment without referring to the baseline value. Every effort should be made for 
the same evaluator to perform each study assessment for the same study subject, for consistency 
in evaluations.  
Subjects are eligible if they have acne vulgaris with a global severity of 3 (moderate) or 
4 (severe) on the EGSS at the B aseline visit. The following scores will be used to describe the 
sever ity grade and subsequent score:

Score  Grade  Description  
0 Clear  Normal, clear skin with no evidence of acne vulgaris  
1 Almost 
Clear  Rare non-inflammatory  lesions present, with rare non inflamed  papules (papules must be 
resolving and may be hyperpigmented, though not pink- red) 
2 Mild  Some non-inflammatory  lesions are present, with few inflammatory lesions 
(papules/pustules only; no nodulocystic lesions)  
3 Moderate  Non-inflammatory  lesions predominate, with multiple inflammatory lesions evident: 
several to many comedones and papules/pustules, and there may or may not be 1 nodulocystic lesion  
4 Severe  Inflammatory lesions are more apparent, many comedones and papules/pustules, there  may 
or may not be up to 2 nodulocystic lesions  
 
11.2.2 Lesion Counts  
The facial area lesion counts will be taken from the subject’s face (including the nose). The 
lesion count groups will be inflammatory and non- inflammatory. Facial inflammatory lesions 
(pustules, papules, and nodules) will be counted as follows: pustules and papules will be counted and recorded together, not separately; nodular lesions will be counted and recorded separately. Non-inflammatory  lesions (open and closed comedones) will be counted and recorded together. 
The lesion  counts will be collected at each visit and/or upon discontinuation.  The following are 
definitions of each lesion type counted: 
Inflammatory lesions  are defined as follows:  
 
Papule:  An erythematous, raised, palpable lesion less than 5 mm in diameter  
Pustule: An erythematous, raised, likely palpable lesion containing white exudate or pus less  
than 5 mm in diameter  
Nodule: A deep -seated, erythematous, firm lesion greater than 5 mm in dia meter  
 
Non-inflammatory lesions  are defined as follows:  
 
Open comedon e (blackhead):   A widely dilated sebaceous follicle plugged with darkly  
pigmented sebum  
Closed comedone (whitehead): A small, closed sebaceous follicle distended with sebum, with  
a white appearance  
11.2.3 Other Assessments  
Photography 
At select study center s, photographs of the face will be taken at Baseline and at Weeks 4, 8 , and 
12. Only subjects who provide written photographic consent for facial photographs will be 
included in photography. 
11.3 Evaluation of Safety

local symptoms ( i.e., symptoms present at the study drug application site) that include itching , 
burning, and stinging . The subject will self -assess all tolerability symptoms; the assessment will 
be based on an average over the period since the previous study visit. 
Tolerability symptoms that result in the subject’s requiring a concomitant therapy, interruption of 
treatment, or discontinuation from the study, will be reported as an AE. 
Itching: 
0 – None   No itch ing

11.3.3 Medical History and Abbreviated Physical Examination 
A medical history will be taken at Screening , and confirmed and revised if needed, at Baseline. 
Medical histories having resolved 2 or more years before Baseline need not be collected unless 
considered relevant by the i nvestigator.  
An abbreviated physical examination including measurements of weight and vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, respiration rate, and oral temperature) wi ll be performed at Screening , 
Baseline and Week 12 ( end of treatment/study ); height will also be measured , but only at the 
Screening visit. Any abnormal physical exam ination  findings will be recorded and evaluated for 
AE reporting  
11.3.4 Laboratory Tests 
Clinical laboratory analyses ( CBC/Diff and serum chemistry ) will be conducted on blood 
samples collected from subjects at Baseline and Week 12. All results will be reported, including results that are abnormal. Clinically significant results, in the opinion of the  investigator, should 
be reported as AEs. If an AE should require laboratory testing, the results of the test must be obtained by the study center  and filed in the subject’s documentation.  
For pre- menses females and FOCBP , a serum pregnancy test will be c onducted at Baseline and 
Week 12.  
11.3.5 Pregnancy Tests  
All females who are pre- menses and FOCBP  will undergo serum pregnancy testing at the 
Baseline and W eek 12  study visits, and urine pregnancy testing at Screening, prior to 
randomization at Baseline, and at Weeks 2, 4, 8 and 12. The urine pregnancy tests will be 
supplied by the CRO/designee.

44 11.4 Adverse Events  
11.4.1 Definition of Adverse Event  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject 
administered a medicinal product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the study drug. AEs include any unfavorable and unintended illness, sign, symptom, clinically significant laboratory test abnormality, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal pro duct that has appeared or worsened during the course of the clinical trial, regardless 
of causal relationship to the study drug(s) under study. AEs  include any illness, sign, symptom, 
or out-of- range and clinically significant laboratory finding that has a ppeared or worsened during 
the course of the clinical trial, regardless of causal relationship to the study. The collection of AEs will begin following the subject's completion of the consent process to participate in the study.  
11.4.2 Documenting Adverse Experiences  
It is the responsibility of the investigator to document all AEs that occur during the course of the study. The AEs should be documented as a single medical diagnosis. When this is not possible, the AE should be documented in terms of signs and/or symptoms observed by the investigator or reported by the subject at each study visit. Each AE which appears to be independent of any prior event will be reported separately.  
All AEs occurring after the subject signs the informed consent through the last study visit must be reported, regardless of whether or not the AEs are considered study drug -related. All AEs, 
whether in response to a query, observed by the study center  personnel, or reported 
spontaneously by the subject, will be recorded. Any AEs deemed rel ated to treatment reported or 
observed at the final study/treatment visit will be followed until stabilization or resolution  
At each visit during the study, the subject will be assessed for the occurrence of new and ongoing 
AEs. Cutaneous safety and tolerability signs and symptoms that result in the subject’s requiring a 
concomitant therapy , interruption of treatment, or discontinuation from the study will be reported 
as an AE. The following data will be collected on all AEs and recorded on the appropriate e CRF:  
• Event description (diagnosis preferred, if unknown, record the signs/symptoms) 
• Onset date and end date 
• Maximum intensity (severity)  
• Seriousness 
• Action taken regarding study drug 
• Corrective treatment, if given  
• Outcome 
In addition, the investigator’s assessment of causality will be recorded.  
Protocol V01- 126A -301           Bausc h Health  
 
 
Version 1.0, 14 October 2019   CONFIDENTIAL  
45 Vital sign and laboratory abnormalities are to be recorded as AEs only if they are clinically 
significant (for example: are symptomatic, requiring corrective treatment, leading to 
discontinuation or fulfilling a se riousness criterion).  
11.4.3 Serious Adverse Events  
All AEs will be assessed as either serious or nonserious. An SAE  is defined as any untoward 
medical occurrence that , at any dose:  
• Results in death . 
• Is immediately life threatening, (the term “life thr eatening” in the definition of 
“serious” refers to an event in which the subject is at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe) . 
• Requires subject  hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization 
(hospitalization for elective surgery for a baseline condition is not considered an AE). 
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (permanent or substantial 
disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions). 
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect . 
• Is a medically important event that may not be immediately life threatening or result 
in death or hospitalization, but may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention  to prevent one of the above listed outcomes ; examples of such 
events include, but are not limited to, allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization . 
Note: A spontaneous abortion will be considered an SAE, and must be reported to the Sponsor within 24 hours of your awareness of the event as outlined under Section 11.4.6. 
11.4.4 Assessment of Severity  
The severity assigned to an AE should be determined by the maximum severity of the AE. The 
categories described below should be used to estimate the severity of AEs:  
• Mild: Transient or mild discomfort; no limitation in activity; no medical 
intervention/therapy required. 
• Moderate: Mild to moderate limitation in activity; some assistance may be needed; no or minimal medical intervention/therapy required . 
• Severe: Marked limitation in activity; some assistance usuall y required; medical 
intervention/therapy required; hospitalization or prolongation of current 
hospitalization possible; may be incapacitating or life threatening .

Version 1.0, 14 October 2019   CONFIDENTIAL  
46 11.4.5 Assessment of Causality  
The investigator should assess the relationship of the AE, if any, to the study drug as either 
“Related” or “Not Related .” The following should be taken into account when assessing AE/SAE 
causality:  
• Related: There is at least a reasonable possibility that the AE/SAE is related to the 
study drug. Reasonable possibility means that there is evidence to suggest a causal 
relationship  between the drug and the AE. 
• Not Related: There is little or no reasonable possibility that the AE/SAE is related to 
the study drug. This assessment implies that the AE/SAE has little or no temporal 
relationship to the study drug and/or a more likely or certai n alternative etiology 
exists.  
The following should be considered when assessing AE/SAE causality: 
• Positive temporal relationship to study drug, such as if the study drug was withdrawn 
and the SAE resolved, or the event recurred after re-introduction 
• If there is a reasonable possibility that the AE is associated with an underlying or concomitant illness  
• Possible association with previous or concomitant therapy 
• No temporal relationship to the study drug and/or a more likely alternative etiology exists.  
• Is the AE is directly related to study procedures or there is a lack of efficacy  
11.4.6 Reporting of Serious Adverse Events  
Adverse events classified as “serious” require expeditious handling and reporting to sponsor or 
designee within 24 hours of study center  notification to comply with regulatory requirements.  
All SAEs, whether related or unrelated to study drug, must be immediately reported to the medical monitor and CRO contact within 24 hours of the investigator’s awareness of the event. All SAEs must be reported via confirmed facsimile  or email  transmission and must be submitted 
on a written SAE report form signed by the investigator within 24 hours of the investigator’s awareness of the event.

Investigators should not wait to receive additional information to fully docum ent the event 
before notifying medical monitor and Sponsor of an SAE. If only limited information is initially 
available, follow-up reports are required. Additional relevant information such as hospital records and autopsy reports should be provided to the Sponsor as soon as they are available. Should the investi gator become aware of an SAE (regardless of its relationship to study drug ) 
that occurs within 30 days after stopping the study drug, the SAE must be reported in accordance with procedures specified in this protocol. 
All deaths of subjects, regardless of cause, and which are known to the Investigator will be 
reported on the appropriate eCRF for up to 30 days after the administration of study drug, regardless of the Investigator's opinion regarding drug relationship. Documentation of the subject’s cause of d eath and a copy of the autopsy or hospital report will also be provided. The 
Medical Monitor and CRO contact  must be notified within 24 hours of knowledge of the event 
by telephone (and/or facsimile/email) of all subject deaths. W ritten follow -up must be r eceived 
by the medical monitor and the IRB/IEC  within five ( 5) calendar days of initial notification.  
 
The investigator should take all appropriate measures to ensure the safety of the subjects, notably 
he/she should follow a subject with an SAE until the event has resolved or the condition has stabilized. This may imply that follow -up will continue after the subject has left the study, and 
that additional investigations may be requested by the Sponsor. When a SAE persist s at the end 
of the study, the i nvestigator will conduct follow -up conta cts with the subject until the 
investigator/Sponsor agree the event is satisfactorily resolved and/or stabilized. If at any time 
after 30 days after administration of study drug, the investigator becomes aware of an SAE which he/she feels is related to study drug or procedure, this must also be reported immediately (within 24 hours of knowledge of occurrence) by telephone and confirmed facsi mile 
transmission/email to the medical monitor and Sponsor and/or Sponsor designee. 
11.4.7 Expedited Serious A dverse E vent Reports  
Expedited SAE reports are those that are both unexpected based on the reference document 
(Investigator Brochure) and are related (i.e.,  the relationship cannot be ruled out) to the study 
drug. The Sponsor will notify regulatory authorities of these AEs and all participating study center s in writing for submission by the investigator to the IRB/IEC. This notification will be in 
the form of a safety u pdate to the Investigator Brochure ( i.e., a “15 -day letter”).  
Upon receiving such notices, the investigator must review and retain the notice with the Investigator Brochure and immediately submit a copy of this information to the responsible IRB/IEC according to local regulations. The investigator and IRB/IEC will determin e if the 
informed consent requires revision. The investigator should also comply with the IRB/IEC procedures for reporting any other safety information.

48 11.4.8 Pregnancy  
All pre -menses females and FOCBP must use an effective method of birth control during the 
course of the study, in a manner such that risk of contraceptive failure is minimized. Abstinence 
is allowed as a birth control method. 
Before enrolling a pre -menses female or FOCBP  in this clinical study , the investigator must 
review the following informatio n about study participation: 
• Informed consent requirements 
• Contraceptives in current use 
Following review of this information and appropriate subject counseling, the investigator or 
designee and the subject must sign the informed consent /assent  before study enrollment. 
During the study, all pre -menses females and FOCBP  should be instructed to contact the 
investigator immediately if they suspect they might be pregnant (eg, missed or late menstrual period). 
If a subject or investigator suspects that the subject may be pregnant prior to study enrollment, 
the study drug must be withheld until the results of laboratory pregnancy testing are available. If pregnancy is confirmed, the subject must not receive study drug and must not be enrolled in the study. If pregnancy is suspected while the subject is receiving study drug , the study drug must 
immediately be withheld until the result of pregnancy testing is known. If pregnancy is confirmed, the study drug will be permanently discontinued and the subject will be followed until the pregnancy comes to term. A Pregnancy Report F orm will be submitted to the sponsor, 
initially and at the end of the pregnancy, which includes the outcome of the pregnancy and any complications occurring during the pregnancy or the delivery.  If any SAEs are associated with 
the pregnancy, including spontaneous abortion/miscarriage, an SAE form must be filled out in addition to the Pregnancy Report Form and submitted as per section  11.4.6.  
All confirmed pregnancies must be immediately reported to the medical monitor and CRO contact within 24 hours of the investigator’s awareness of the pregnancy. All confirmed pregnancies are to be reported on a pregnancy form using the same reporting procedure for an SAE under Section 11.4.6.  
12 Statistics  
All statistical processing will be performed using SAS® version 9.3 or later unless otherwise 
stated. Statistical significance will be based on 2- tailed tests of the null hypothesis resulting in 
p-values of 0.05 or less. 
The primary method of handling missing efficacy data will be based on estimation using the 
method of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) imputation.  E stimation will be done for each 
treatment group separately so that the pattern of missing ness for one group does not influence the 
estimation of missing data for another group.  Groups of complete datasets following the 
Protocol V01- 126A -301           Bausc h Health  
 
 
Version 1.0, 14 October 2019   CONFIDENTIAL  
49 estimation will be concatenated to f orm analysis datasets for the comparative analyses  and 
subsequent imputation result inference with SAS PROC MIANALYZE. Descriptive statistics 
will also be derived from the multiply imputed datasets . 
Additionally, a model- based multiple imputation process will be used as a sensitivity analysis to 
the MCMC imputation.  The absolute change in lesion count will also be analyzed using a 
repeated measures ANCOVA for lesion count data or a repeated measures logistic regression model (generalized estimating equatio ns) for the dichotomized EGSS. Fi nally, a tipping point 
analysis will be performed for the primary endpoints. 
A statistical analysis plan, describing all statistical analyses will be provided as a separate 
document. The SAP will be finalized prior to unblinding of the study treatments. 
Evaluations and Analyses 
Inflammatory lesions and non- inflammatory lesions will be recorded for each subject at Baseline 
and at Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12. The absolute and percent change from baseline of inflammatory lesions and non-inflammatory lesions will be derived for each subject at Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12. 
The EGSS will be recorded for each Subject. The EGSS will be dichotomized into “success” and 
“failure” at Week 2, 4, 8 and 12 with a subject considered a success for those visits if the EGSS is at least 2 grades less than baseline and are Clear or Almost Clear.  
Subjects will be asked to complete the Acne- Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire at Baseline 
and Week 12. 
12.1 Assessment of Efficacy  
Primary, secondary, and supportive efficacy analyses will be conducted on the ITT (primary) 
population. Primary efficacy analyses will be conducted on the PP (supportive) population. 
12.1.1 Primary Efficacy  
There are three co-primary efficacy endpoints : 
• Absolute change in inflammatory lesion count from B aseline to Week 12  
• Absolute change in non- inflammatory  lesion count from B aseline to Week 12  
• Percent age of subjects who achieve at least a two -grade reduction from baseline and 
are Clear or Almost Clear at  Week 12 in the EGSS.  
12.1.2 Secondary Efficacy  
The secondary efficacy endpoints will be the following : 
• Percent change in inflammatory lesion count from Baseline to Week 12  
• Percent change in non -inflammatory lesion count from Baseline to Week 12  
• Percentage of subjects who have at least a 2 grade reduction at Week 12 from 
Baseline in the EGSS  
• Percent change in inflammatory lesion count from Baseline to Week 8

50 • Percent change in non -inflammatory lesion count from Baseline to Week 8  
• Percent change in inflammatory lesi on count from Baseline to Week 4 
• Percent change in non -inflammatory lesion count from Baseline to Week 4  
12.1.3 Supportive Efficacy  
The supportive efficacy endpoints will be as follows: 
• Percent change in inflammatory lesion count from Baseline to Week 2  
• Percent change in non- inflammatory lesion count from Baseline to Week 2  
• Percentage of subjects who have at least a 2 grade reduction at Week 8 from Baseline 
in the EGSS  
• Percentage of subjects who have at least a 2 grade reduction at Week 4 from Baseline in the EGSS  
• Percentage of subjects who have at least a 2 grade reduction at Week 2 from Baseline in the EGSS  
12.1.4 Test of Superiority for Lesion Count Variables  Evaluator's Global Severity Score 
This section provides the basic model and statistical approach which is used in combination with 
the multiple imputation procedures described in Section 12.1.9 Tes ts of superiority for the 
absolute change from Baseline in inflammatory and non-inflammatory lesions will be based on either parametric or non -parametric methods consistent with the statistical assumptions required 
to support the analyses. Specifically, the tests of superiority will be based on an ANCOVA with factors of treatment and analysis center and the respective Baseline lesion count as a covariate or on ranked data submitted to an ANCOVA with factors of treatment and analysis center and the respective Baseline lesion count as a covariate.  If the treatment -by-analysis center interaction 
effect is significant at an alpha less than 0.10, then the effect will be included in the model; otherwise it will be removed.  
A skewness test, based on the methods pr esented by  Zar (1984) will be applied to the residuals 
resulting from an ANCOVA. A 2-sided p- value for the skewness test significant at 0.01 will 
imply the use of the nonparametric method. If a parametric analysis is indicated, the results of the parametri c analysis will be considered the primary analysis. Should a nonparametric analysis 
be indicated, the absolute of percent changes in inflammatory and non- inflammatory  lesions will 
be rank transformed prior to submitting them to the ANCOVA. Results of the rank transformed analyses then will be considered the primary analysis; however, results of the nonrank transformed analyses will also be presented.  
12.1.5 Test of Superiority for EGSS  
The EGSS will be dichotomized into “success” and “failure” with a subject considered a success for those visits if the Evaluator’s Global Severity Score is at least 2 grades less than Baseline and are Clear or Almost Clear. The analysis of the dichotomized Evaluator's Global Severity Score will be based on a logistic regression test with factors of treatment group and analysis center.

51 12.1.6 Statistical Hypothesis Testing and Control of Multiplicity  
Statistical hypothesis testing for lesion count analyses will be conducted as described in this 
section and will employ the methods of Section 12.1.9 regarding missing values. The analysis of the dichotomized Evaluator's Global Severity Score will be based on the logistic regression with factors of treatment group and analysis center and employs the methods of Section 12.1.9 
regarding missing values.  
The overall Type I error will be controlled by requiring the three co -primary efficacy endpoints 
to be statistically significant. Specifically, failure of any one of the primary efficacy endpoints 
will invalidate the statistical significance of the secondary efficacy endpoints.  
The following stepwise process will be conducted for testing the secondary efficacy endpoints in order to control for multiplicity. These tests will be performed for only the ITT population. The testing process will terminate whenever a statistical test for a step is not significant. All subsequent tests for the remaining steps will be considered not significant. The order of testing is:  
Step 
Number  Secondary Endpoint  
1 Percent change in non -inflammatory lesion count from Baseline to Week 12  
2 Percent change in inflammatory lesion count from Base line to Week 12  
3 Percentage of subjects who have at least a 2 grade reduction at Week 12 from 
Baseline in the EGSS  
4 Percent change in non -inflammatory lesion count from Baseline to Week 8  
5 Percent change in inflammatory lesion count from Baseline to Week 8  
6 Percent change in non -inflammatory lesion count from Baseline to Week 4  
7 Percent change in inflammatory lesion count from Baseline to Week 4  
 
The following stepwise process will be conducted for testing the supportive efficacy endpoints in 
order to control for multiplicity. These tests will be performed for only the ITT population. In order to control for multiplicity, failure of any one of the secondary efficacy endpoints will invalidate the statistical significance of the supportive efficacy endpoints. The testing process will terminate whenever a statistical test for a step is not significant. All subsequent tests for the remaining steps will be considered not significant. The order of testing is:  
Step

12.1.7 Descriptive Statistics  
Descriptive statistics will be presented for the following parameters by treatment group for both 
the ITT and PP populations: 
• Frequency and percent distributions of the EGSS  at Baseline and Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 
12. 
• Frequency and percent distributions of dichotomized (two -grade reduction from 
baseline and are Clear or Almost Clear; two - grade reduction from baseline) EGSS at 
Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12. 
• Descriptive statistics including mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum will be used to summarize inflammatory and non -inflammatory lesion 
counts at Baseline and Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12.   
• Descriptive statistics including mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and 
maximum will be used to summarize the absolute and percent change in 
inflammatory and non-inflammatory lesion counts at Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12. 
12.1.8 Pooling Analysis  
The clinical study will be conducted under a common protocol for each investigational site with the intention of pooling the data for analysis.  Every effort will be made to promote consistency in study execution at each investigational site. The study is intended to be conducted in a manner such tha t a minimum of 15 subjects will be enrolled for any investigator  (i.e., approximately at 
least 10 subjects in the IDP-126 Gel  arm and at least 5 subjects in the Vehicle Gel  arm) .  In the 
event that there are too few subjects for an investigator, then this investigator's data will be combined, within geographic region (i.e., US, Canada), to achieve the desired sample size minimum per arm.   The combining of investigator's data will be accomplished by taking the 
investigator with the smallest enrollment and combining it with the investigator with the largest enrollment. If there is a further need to combine data, then the data of the investigator with the second smallest enrollment will be combined with the investigator's data which had the second largest enrol lment, and so on.  This process will continue for all investigators who did not have a 
minimum of 15 subjects .  The process of combining investigator data that have insufficient 
subjects per treatment arm will result in redefining the groups of investigato rs for the purposes of 
statistical analyses.  These combined groups will be referred to as "analysis centers" in the statistical analyses based on ANCOVA and stratified logistic testing.  
Prior to investigating the treatment effect within the analysis cent ers, the magnitude of the site 
main effect will be investigated to determine if the main site -to-site variability is such that it 
Protocol V01- 126A -301           Bausc h Health  
 
 
Version 1.0, 14 October 2019   CONFIDENTIAL  
53 could mask the analysis center effects. Thus, prior to pooling, the lesion count data at Week 12 
will be analyzed with an ANCOVA with factors of treatment group, site, and the interaction term of treatment group by site and also the percent of subjects with treatment success at Week 12 will be analyzed with a logistic regression with factors of treatment group, site, and the interaction term of treatment group by site. If the ses analyses are  not computationally feasible 
due to some sites having very few subjects enrolled, the low enrolling sites will be excluded from th ese analy ses. 
The consistency of treatment response will be investigated across the analysis centers subsequent to combining the data as described above.  Statistical tests will be conducted to identify if there are extreme analysis centers that could affe ct the interpretation of common statistical and clinical 
conclusions.  An analysis center by treatment interaction will be included in the primary variable analyses to test for parallel treatment effect at an alpha level of 0.10.  Change from baseline in inflammatory lesions and non- inflammatory lesions will be analyzed with an ANCOVA 
(unranked or ranked) with factors of treatment, analysis center, and treatment by analysis center interaction and the respective baseline lesion count variable as a covariate.   For the purpose of 
testing consistency of treatment response, the dichotomized E GSS will be analyzed with a 
logistic regression procedure with factors of treatment, analysis center, and treatment by analysis center interaction. Further examination will f ollow for any variables that have a significant 
ANC OVA or logistic regression interaction term.  In the event that the AN COVA or logistic 
regression interaction (referred to henceforth as the "appropriate test") p-value is less than or equal to 0.10, a sensitivity analysis that excludes analysis centers with the extreme efficacy result will be performed to determine the robustness of the treatment effect.  On the other hand, if the outcome of the appropriate test has a p-value greater than 0.10, then the conclusions from the pooled data will be considered to be free of the impact of extreme analysis centers . 
The first step in conducting a sensitivity analysis is to identify the extreme analysis center or centers that contribute to the statistical significanc e of the appropriate test.  The process involves 
submitting subsets of analysis centers to the appropriate test and observing the appropriate test p-
value for the subset.  Subsets with p-values greater than 0.10 for the appropriate test are 
considered homo geneous.  
The search for an extreme analysis center begins by analyzing all subsets that can be created by excluding one analysis center.  If one or more of the subsets result in an appropriate test p- value 
greater than or equal to 0.10, then the analysis c enter excluded from the subset with the largest p -
value for the appropriate test is deemed to be the extreme analysis center.  
If all appropriate test subset p -values are less than or equal to 0.10, then the process will analyze 
the appropriate test for all  subsets that can be created by excluding two analysis centers.  If one 
or more of these subsets generate appropriate test p -values larger than 0.10, then the analysis 
centers excluded from the subset with the largest appropriate test p -value are deemed the extreme 
analysis centers.  
Protocol V01- 126A -301           Bausc h Health  
 
 
Version 1.0, 14 October 2019   CONFIDENTIAL  
54 Thus, the process of identifying the extreme analysis centers will continue in a stepwise manner 
by first excluding one, then two, then three, etc., analysis centers until the appropriate test p-value exceeds 0.10.  
Once the extreme analysis center or centers have been identified, then the treatment p -values of 
the remaining analysis centers will be computed.  Inferences will be drawn from the treatment p -
value, as well as any pertinent observations regarding the extreme analysis  center or centers.  
Additionally, it is noted that this process excludes subjects from the analysis in a non-random 
manner and has an unpredictable impact on the power of the treatment effect test.  In the event that the treatment effect of the remaining subset is not statistically significant, due consideration of the post-hoc aspects of the process will be given when the results are interpreted.  Conclusions will be presented by the sponsor as appropriate to the findings of the sensitivity analysis. 
12.1.9 Miss ing Efficacy Data Imputations 
Lesion Count Variable Missing Data Imputation 
Missing 12 -week data will be estimated by multiple imputation and subsequently analyzed. 
Missing lesion count data will be derived for the analysis using the method of Markov Chain 
Monte Carlo (MCMC) multiple  imputation method.  The pattern of missing observations in each 
treatment group will not influence the missing value estimation in the other because the 
imputation is being conducted independently for each treatment group. 
Multiple imputation and subsequent analysis will involve 3 distinct phases with these principal 
tasks:  
1. Create a data set of subjects, one for each treatment group, with observed values and 
those needing estimation by MCMC.  The missing lesion count values in ea ch data set 
will be filled in using the MCMC method 5 times to generate 5 data sets.  The resulting 
data sets for each treatment arm will be combined into one complete data set for each 
imputation.  
Syntax:  
proc mi data=datain out=dataout seed=&seed. nimpute=5<options>; 
 where trtpn=(1, or 2); 
 mcmc chain=multiple; 
 var baseline week2 week4 week8 week12; 
run; 
2. For each complete data set, the absolute change in lesion counts will be computed. 
Each complete data set will be analyzed as specified for the p articular analysis.  
3. The results from these analyses will be combined into a single inference using SAS 
PROC MIANALYZE.  
A total of 4 random seeds will be needed to impute inflammatory lesion counts from non-
inflammatory lesion counts for the two treatment g roups. Those 4 random seeds have been pre-
specified by using a random number generator:

• Non-Inflammatory Lesion Counts; IDP -126 Vehicle: Seed= 292539299  
EGSS Missing Data Imputation 
A similar procedure will be used for the analyses based on percentage of EGSS successes 
wherein the ANCOVA analysis is replaced with a logistic regression analysis.  Specifically, missing 12 week EGSS values from which the dichotomized EGSS is derived will be estimated by (MCMC) . The pattern of missing observations in each treatment group will not influence the 
missing value estimation in the other because the imputation is being conducted independently for each treatment group. 
The missing 12 week EGSS values will be derived for the analysis using the method of Markov 
Chain  Monte Carlo (MCMC) multiple imputation. Multiple imputation and subsequent analysis 
will involve 3 principal tasks: 
1. Create a data set, one for each treatment group, of subjects with observed values and 
those needing estimation by MCMC.  The missing EGSS values in each data set will be 
filled in using the MCMC method 5 times to generate 5 data sets. The resulting data 
sets for each treatment arm will be combined into one complete data set by imputation.  
Syntax:

  where trtpn=(1, or 2); 
  mcmc chain=multiple; 
  var baseline week2 week4 week8 week12; 
run; 
2. For each complete data set, the dichotomous success rate (clear or almost clear with a 
2-point change from baseline) will be computed. The 12-week imputed EGSS values 
will be rounded to the nearest integer value prior to evaluating the success rate. Each complete data set will be analyzed with a logistic regression with factors of treatment 
group and analysis center. 
3. The results from these anal yses will be combined into a single inference using SAS 
PROC MIANALYZE.  
A total of 2 random seeds will be needed to impute EGSS for the two treatment groups. Those 2 
random seeds have been pre-specified by using a random number generator:

56 The first sensitivity analysis for absolute change in lesion count will use a repeated measures 
ANCOVA, with  treatment, analysis center, and visit (ie, Week 2, Week 4, Week 8) as 
independent factors and a covariate of baseline lesion count.  In this analysis, data from all post-baseline visits will be included with no imputation for missing data.  
The second sens itivity analysis will use the model based multiple imputation method to impute 
missing data for the absolute change in lesion counts at Week 12.  Although the full details will be presented in the SAP, the multiple imputation will involve 3 principal tasks: 
1. Missing values will be filled in 5 times to generate 5 data sets.  The imputation model 
used will be  regression with factors of treatment group and analysis center, and a covariate of baseline lesion count (ie, the imputation model will be the same as the 
analysis model). Appropriate modifications will be made should the analysis be based 
on a non- parametric method.  
2. Each complete data set will be analyzed with an ANCOVA with factors of treatment 
group, and analysis center, and a covariate of baseline lesion count. 
3. Results from these analyses will be combined into a single inference using SAS PROC

A total of 2 random seeds will be needed. Those 2 random seeds have been pre- specified by 
using a random number generator: 
• Inflammatory Lesion Counts : Seed= 486490207  
• Non-Inflammatory Lesion Counts: Seed= 1889770192  
Sensitivity analyses for EGSS 
The first sensitivity analysis for the dichotomized EGSS success will use a repeated measures 
logistic regression model (generalized estimating equations), w ith dichotomized EGSS success 
as the dependent variable and treatment, analysis center, and visit (ie, Week 2, Week 4, Week 8) as independent factors.  In this analysis, data from all post- baseline visits will be included with 
no imputation for missing dat a. 
The second sensitivity analysis will use the model based multiple imputation method to impute missing data for the dichotomized EGSS data. Although the full details will be presented in the SAP, the multiple imputation will involve 3 principal tasks: 
1. Missing values will be filled in 5 times to generate 5 data sets.  The imputation model 
used logistic regression with factors of treatment group and analysis center (ie, the 
imputation model will be the same as the analysis model).  
2. Each complete data set will be analyzed with a logistic regression a factors of treatment 
group and analysis center.

Tipping Point Analysis 
A tipping point analysis of each primary endpoint will be performed as a sensitivity analysis 
for the handling of missing data. 
12.1.11 Subgroup Analyses 
 Subset analyses will be conducted for the ITT populations for the subgroups of baseline global 
severity, gender, age, ethnicity, race and geographical region . Age will be dichotomized to less 
than the median age of subjects and greater than or equal to the median age of subjects. An additional analysis will include age with categories of less than 18 and greater than or equal to 18. Subset analyses will be conducted on the variables absolute change from baseline in inflammatory lesions and non- inflammatory lesions at Week 12 as well as the dichotomized 
global severity score at Week 12.  These analyses will contain only descriptive statistics.  
12.1.12 Subject Self -Assessments 
Subjects will be asked to complete the Acne- Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire (Appendix 
17.3).  Descri ptive statistics will be used to summarize the data reported for the questionnaire. 
No inferential analyses will be conducted.  
12.2 Assessment of Safety  
All safety assessments will be conducted using the safety analysis set.  
Safety will be evaluated by tabulations of AEs , and Cutaneous Safety and Tolerability 
Evaluations. Cutaneous Safety Evaluation scores (erythema, scaling , hypo/hyper- pigmentation ) 
and Tolerability (itching, burning, and stinging) will be presented with desc riptive statistics at 
Baseline and at Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12 for each treatment group. In addition, the percent of subjects who experience a cutaneous reaction graded at a level of 3 at any point in the study following the first application of study drug will be tabulated. Frequencies and percentages for 
each outcome category will be included in these statistics. Mean values will be presented graphically by week and treatment group. 
12.2.1 Adverse Events  
All AEs  occurring during the study will be recorded and classified on the basis of Medical 
Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) terminology. Descriptions of AEs will include 
the date of onset, the date the AE ended, the severity of the AE, the relationship to study drug , 
the action taken regarding study dru g usage, the action taken to treat the AE, and the outcome.

58 Treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs) are those events with an onset on or after the date 
of the first study drug application. All reported TEAEs will be summarized by the number of 
subjects reporting TEAEs, system organ class, preferred term, severity, seriousness, and 
relationship to study drug.  
Adverse events will be summarized by treatment group and severity. Each subject will be counted only once within a system organ class or a preferred term by using the AEs with the highest severity within each category . 
Adverse events will be summarized by treatment group and relationship to study drug . Each 
subject will b e counted only once within a system organ class or a preferred term by using the 
AEs with the greatest relationship within each category.  
The percentage of subjects reporting AEs will be summarized by treatment group for AEs occurring in at least 5% of subjects (either treatment group). The percentage of subjects for each treatment group will be compared using a Fisher’s Exact test.  
All information pertaining to AEs noted during the study will be listed by subject, detailing the verbatim term given by the investigator, preferred term, system organ class, start date, stop date, 
severity, action taken, and drug relatedness. The AE onset will also be shown relative (in number of days) to the day of initial dose of the randomized study drug . 
Serious adverse even ts will be tabulated by subject within treatment groups.  
In addition, a list of subjects who discontinued from the study and a list of subjects who experienced SAEs will also be provided. 
12.2.2 Safety Laboratory Tests  
Changes from baseline in safety laboratory v alues will be summarized with descriptive statistics 
at all applicable study visits. Shift tables will be presented for changes in safety laboratory 
values. Normal ranges established by the central laboratory will be used to determine the shifts. A listing  of all out-of- range laboratory test results at any assessment time point will also be 
provided. Determination of clinical significance for all out-of- range laboratory values will be 
made by each investigator and included in the listing. In addition, a lis ting of all clinically 
significant laboratory test results will be provided.  
12.2.3 Vital Sign Measurements  
Changes from baseline in vital sign measurements will be summarized with descriptive statistics 
for each treatment group at all applicable study visits.  In addition, shifts in vital sign results 
(normal to abnormal, abnormal to normal, etc., based on the normal ranges) from Baseline to 
Week 6 (or ET) will be summarized using shift tables.  
Individual vital sign test results will be presented in a by -subject l isting. A listing of all out-of-
range vital sign measurements at any assessment time point will also be provided.

59 12.2.4 Concomitant Medications  
All recorded prior and concomitant medications will be classified based on terminology from the 
World Health Organizat ion (WHO)  Drug Dictionary. T herapies and medications data will be 
presented in data listings. 
12.3 Subject  Disposition  
A tabulation of subject disposition will be provided. The tabulation will include the numbers of 
subjects who enter the study, complete the study, and discontinue the study. The reasons for discontinuation will be included. 
12.4 Demographics and Baseline Characteristics  
Subject demographic and baseline characteristics will be summarized by study drug group using 
both the ITT , PP, and the Safety  analysis sets . For continuous variables (e g, age) , comparisons 
among the two  study drug groups will be conducted using a two -way analysis of variance with 
factor s of treatment  and analysis center . Ethnicity and race will be analyzed with a Cochran -
Mantel -Haenszel test stratified by analysis center . Past and current medical conditions, as well as 
history of disease, will be presented in a data listing and not be compared statistically.  
12.5 Protocol Deviations 
All protocol deviations will be reported to the Sponsor and recorded throughout the study. A tabulation of protocol deviations will be included in a data listing . 
12.6 Compliance  
The number and percentage of subjects who are compliant in each treatment group will be summarized descriptively. Subjects may not miss  more than five consecutive days of dosing and 
must take 80-120% of expected doses to be considered compliant. The number of expected doses will be determined for each subject based on the length of their participation in the study and will be capped at 89  days; the number of planned doses given a subject attended the Week 12 visit on 
the latest day within window.  
12.7 Interim Analyses  
No interim analyses are planned.  
12.8 Additional Statistical Considerations  
12.8.1 Analysis Sets  
Approximately 180 subjects at least  9 years of age and older with moderate or severe acne ( a 
score of 3 or 4 [moderate to severe] using the EGSS ) will be enrolled and randomized in the 
study. With a 2:1  randomization ratio, it is anticipated that: 
• 120 subjects to receive IDP-126 Gel , once dail y application  
Protocol V01- 126A -301           Bausc h Health  
 
 
Version 1.0, 14 October 2019   CONFIDENTIAL  
60 • 60 subjects to receive IDP-126 Vehicle Gel , once daily  application  
The ITT analysis set  will consist of all randomized subjects who received study drug . The safety 
analysis set  will be comprised of all randomized subjects who are confirmed to have dosed at 
least once. 
An ITT analysis will be conducted, as well as a PP analysis. Subjects will be eligible for the PP 
analysis if they complete the 12 -week evaluation without noteworthy study protocol violations 
(i.e., any subject or investigator ac tivity that could have possibly interfered with the therapeutic 
administration of the study drug or the precise evaluation of study drug efficacy). The PP 
analysis set  will include subjects in the safety analysis set  who do not meet any of the following 
criteria:  
• Failed any of the inclusion/exclusion criteria . 
• Have taken any interfering concomitant medications . 
• Did not attend the Week 12 visit 
• Missed more than 1 post baseline study visit prior to Week 12. 
• Have not been compliant with the dosing regimen (i.e., s ubjects may not miss more 
than 5 consecutive days of dosing and must take 80%-120% of expected doses; t he 
number of expected doses will be determined for each subject based on the length of their participation in the study) . 
• Out of vi sit window at the 12-week visit. 
Subjects who discontinue from the study due to an adverse event related to study treatment or documented lack of treatment effect (and/or worsening of condition)  will be included in the PP 
population. Prior to breaking the blind, other additional criteria may be added to the list to accommodate for unforeseen events that occurred during the conduct of the study that result in noteworthy study protocol violations.  
12.8.2 Sample Size Determination  
The power cal culations are based primarily on the observed Week 12 results of the Phase 2 
study, V01-126A-201. This study was a five-arm study including IDP-126 Gel versus each of the 
dual components and Vehicle Gel and is therefore a relevant study for powering the current study.  
A sample size of 120 for the active treatment arm and 60 for the vehicle treatment arm has 
greater than 99% power to detect a statistically significant difference in inflammatory lesions 
with a significance level of 0.05. The estimated absolute change from baseline in treatment means were 29.9 and 19.6 for IDP -126 Gel versus its Vehicle gel, respectively, with a standard 
deviation of 12.0. 
A sample size of 120 for the active treatment arm and 60 for the vehicle treatment arm  has 
greater than 9 9% power to detect a statistically significant difference in non -inflammatory 
Protocol V01- 126A -301           Bausc h Health  
 
 
Version 1.0, 14 October 2019   CONFIDENTIAL  
61 lesions with a significance level of 0.05 using the estimated absolute change from baseline in 
treatment means of 35.5 and 21.8 for IDP -126 Gel versus its Vehicle Gel, respectively, with a 
standard deviation of 16.4. 
In order to achieve at least 9 9% power to detect a statistically significant difference in the 
percentage of subjects who have at least  a 2 grade reduction at Week 12 from Baseline in EGSS 
and are Clear or Almost Clear with a significance level of 0.05, a sample size of 120 for the 
active treatment arm and 60 for the vehicle treatment arm  is required.  The estimated percentages 
with a 2 grade reduction at Week 12 from Baseline in the EGSS and Clear or Almost Clear are 52.5% and 8.1% for IDP -126 Gel versus its Vehicle Gel respectively . 
12.8.3 Handling of Missing Data 
 The method of multiple imputation will be used (see  Missing Efficacy Data Imputations  
section ). 
12.8.4 Multicenter Issues  
The study will be conducted at multiple study center s in North America with the intention of 
pooling the results for analysis. Site specific data summaries, however, will be presented.  
12.8.5 Multiplicity Issues  
The overall Type I error will be controlled by requiring the three co- primary efficacy endpoints  
to be statistically significant. Specifically, failure of any one of the primary efficacy endpoints will invalidate the statistical significance of the secondary efficacy endpoints. See Section  12.1.6 
for further detail  about control of Type I error across primary and secondary endpoints. 
12.8.6 Windowing Rules  
The timing of all study visits is relative to Baseline (Day 0). The Week 2, Week 4, and Week 8 visits should occur within ± 3 days of the scheduled times, the Week 12 visit should occur within −3/+5 days o f the scheduled time.  
13 Quality Control and Quality Assurance  
13.1 Study Monitoring

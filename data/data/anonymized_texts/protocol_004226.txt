 Introduction 
 Given the recently published criteria for hypertension ( HTN ), a blood pressure (BP) >130/80 
mmHg, more Americans are likely to face the challenge of managing this chronic  condition.1 It is 
projected that HTN prevalence among  U.S. adult s will increase from 32% to 46%.2 African 
Americans ( AAs) are disproportionately affected  by HTN when compared to all other racial -ethnic 
groups ,3 and they experience  greater  disease severity (heart attack , stroke)  compared to other 
racial -ethnic groups .3,4 Factors associated with nonadherence to HTN self -management include 
low income, limited access to health  care,  and or the  lack of HTN knowledge ,.4-7 Substantial 
evidence has demonstrated the important role of community support in improving patients' 
management of chronic illnesses.8-11 However, such community support programs rarely  offer 
technology -based intervention ( TBI) as a delivery method  to improve HTN self -management .10 
 
Therefore, this proposal  construct s community partnerships with civic, health, and social 
organizations (Cleveland Council of Black Nurses  and American Heart Association)  to modify 
and evaluate TBI  to promote medication adherence to antihypertensive therapy and improve BP 
control among AA s with HTN. We  propose to adapt and evaluate the efficacy of a multicomponent 
program for HTN self- management referred to as COACHMAN. The proposed project has two 
phases: (1) a community engagement phase , and (2) a pilot evaluation phase. Consistent with the 
principles of community participatory action research,9,12 the project design will include  having  
stakeholders provide feedback on the key feature of COACHMAN to enhance its feasibility and 
acceptability . In addition, we  will generate data on the efficacy of the intervention that will inform 
stakeholders . We will gain information on how  to allocate community resources to promote HTN 
self-management using technology , as well as provide data needed for future federal  grant 
proposal s. A series of informal session s and qualitative interviews will be conducted with 
stakeholders and participants in phase one of the proposed project , and a pilot trial of 
COACHMAN will be conducted  thereafter  on AAs with HTN. 
 
COACHMAN innovatively integrates TBI  with community  resources and enable s participants 
to monitor their blood pressure, access web-based education, mobile application  medication 
management , and receive exposure to behavioral counseling  from  community  health worker to 
support self -managing their HTN .12,13 Our central hypothesis  is that COACH MAN (evidenced -
based strategies  of HTN education, behavioral skills training, and social support) would be more 
effective than usual care at motivating AA s with HTN to improve BP control. A secondary 
hypothesis  is that the COACHMAN intervention w ill result in improved BP control. Thus, the 
aims of this study are:  
 
Aim 1.  Identify key content, design, and resources from a community of stakeholders, including determining facilitators and barriers of HTN management among AAs that 
will inform the development of COACH MAN using  qualitative research methods .  
Aim 2.  Evaluate the feasibility  and acceptability  of COACHMAN to improve BP control .  
Aim 3.  Compare the difference in BP control between COACHMAN and EUC.  
 
Impact : The long -term goal of this project is to generate evidence that will inform interventional 
research that reduces the cardiovascular disease risks and  suboptimal or poor HTN self -
managemen t in this vulnerable  AA population. Cleveland is ideal to conduct this research, as  
Ohio is ranked 15
th nationally for prevalence of HTN, with even higher rates observed in AAs.14 
3 
 A. RESEARCH STRATEGY  
Significance. African Americans (AA s) have higher rates of hypertension ( HTN)  incidence, as 
well as cardiovascular disease (CVD) morbidity and mortality compared to all other racial- ethnic 
cohorts.1-4 HTN is the most influential contributor to incidence of adverse CVD events.15,16 
COACHMAN targets barriers to hypertension (HTN) knowledge, medication adherence, problem - 
solving skills, patient -provider communication, and social support  in an effort to improve blood 
pressure (BP) control. If demonstrated to be effective, COACHMAN will be  practical, scalable, 
and highly generalizable to a wide variety of individuals and serve as a linkage from community 
to clinic in the Cleveland area.  
  
Barriers to BP control and HTN self -management are multifactorial. Poor adherence to anti -
hypertensive therapy ( AHT ) is estimated to occur in 43 -78% of patients prescribed AHT, with 
50% discontinuation after a year, and notably worse and sooner in AAs.3 Recent research now 
recommends lower BP goals.17,18 Evidence  suggests that inability to achieve BP control likely 
arises from a complex interaction of patient, provider, and system -level barriers.6,19 For this 
patient -focused project, the key barriers for BP control and HTN self -management are competing 
health priorities, lack of awareness of  HTN knowledge, lack of confidence to self -manage HTN, 
depression, and lack of social support.20 
  
The use of technology for self -management of chronic disease is evolving.21 Contrary to the 
popular belief that AA s use less technology,22 AA smartphone use is 81% compared to 74% of the 
total population, and AA s spend close to 56 hours a month using apps or mobile Internet browsers 
on their smartphones.22,23 The proposed COACHMAN intervention represents a conceptual 
progress ion of the digital age and leverages technology for education and training, including the 
benefits of convenience, cost, and the ability to remotely deliver a highly focused, short -duration, 
HTN self -management intervention. Preliminary Work.  In one study, our research team conducted 
a 90-minute focus group session to explore AA s’ (N=21) experiences with using technology 
(mobile devices and apps) for HTN self -management,24,25 The majority of the participants owned 
smartphones and used this tec hnology to communicate; seek, acquire, and share information; 
engage in entertainment; and organize and manage time. Participants expressed concerns about 
not being informed or trained to integrate technology for HTN self -management.26  
  
Community engagem ent in HTN self -management. Substantial evidence has demonstrated the 
importan ce of community support in improving patients ’ management of chronic illnesses.11 
Programs that incorporate multiple strategies such as  involving  prominent community member s 
as well as trustworthy health educators  and providing  convenient, low cost, and culturally  tailored 
interventions are more likely to engage AAs .11,27 Unfortunately, such programs rarely  offer 
technology -based intervention ( TBI) as a delivery method. We propose to evaluate the feasibility 
and acceptability of a TBI among AA s with HTN. PI  Dr. Carolyn Still has already begun informal 
sessions with community partners (National Black Nurses Association and A merican Heart 
Association ) as well as hypertension experts to develop this grant proposal and to obtain input to 
begin the initial design of t he TBI for HTN self -management for AA s.  
 
B. INNOVATION. Many communities have begun HTN screening or provider/system initiatives  
to improve BP control. However, such programs have not focused on effective  patient engagement 
strategies with TBIs for self -managing HTN. This proposal addresses those gaps by leveraging 
4 
 successful  and replicable community programs with the addition of TBIs to advance the science 
of HTN self -management.     
 
C. APPROACH . A 
convenience sample of 
AAs with uncontrolled 
HTN will be conducted to 
obtain data on study variables and outcomes  at 
baseline, 8 weeks, and 12 
weeks.  The primary      
outcome is change in BP 
from baseline to three  
months. A secondary 
outcome will be the 
proportion of participants 
achieving BP < 130/80 
mm Hg at three months. 
Ryan and Swain’s Individual and Family 
Self-Management 
Theory ,28 (Figure 1)  guides the m ajor constructs of this study . Community s takeholders w ill be 
engaged throughout the project for continual input to refine and implement study intervention (see 
Statement of Work). The initial phase  of this inquiry will begin by conducting informal sessions 
and focus groups to assess motivators  as well as barriers to HTN management (Aim 1) followed 
by implementation of COACHMAN. Dr. Cheryl Killion  (Nursing Professor at C ase Western 
Reserve University)  has extensive expertise in community participatory research  and will provide 
qualitative method support. 
  
Study Intervention. The COACHMAN intervention  is comprised of  four components : 1) self -
monitoring blood pressure ( SMBP ), 2) web -based education  (adapted from the American Heart 
Association ’s Check, Change, Control ),12 3) training/support for Medisafe application, and 4)  
nurse counseling. Study investigators will also use forged and ongoing relationships with the 
Cleveland Council of Black Nurses ( CCBN) and other community partners to engage in all aspects 
of this study and serve as Community Health Worker s (CHWs).10 The Enhanced Usual Care 
(EUC) group  will receive one education session on SMBP and printed materials from the 
American Heart Association on “The Facts About High B lood Pressure” and the DASH Diet . All 
participants will receive study -provided automated home BP monitors (Omron  10 Series).  
  
Setting and Sample.  Given that this is a  pilot study , a sample size of 40 is considered adequate. 
Participant inclusion criteria are as follows : (1) self-identify ing as AA; (2) a ged 30 years or  older ; 
(3) diagnosed with HTN ( BP > 140/90 mm  Hg) and taking at least one antihypertensive 
medication ; (4) able to read/understand English; and ( 5) own a smartphone with a data plan, with 
the capability to download the Medisafe app  and view videos . Exclusion criteria  are: (1) history of 
cognitive impairmen t, and (2) currently using medication management app.

 Recruitment and Retention.  Various recruitment strategies  such as fliers, brochures, and target 
ads through social media platforms (Facebook, ResearchMatch.org), as well as advertisements at 
community events  and clinics ,29 will be used simultaneously . In addition, our community partners 
will assist recruitment. Our study population will be recruited from University Hospitals and from 
community outreach engagement. We anticipate limited difficulty in recruiting participants due to the Dr. Still’s experience in clinical research  and long- term working relationship with the 
participants and providers, as well as continued work with other c ardiovascular trials. We will 
recruit three participants per week over a 4 -month (December -April) period. 
While Dr.  Still has 
experience with recruiting and managing clinical trials, she is an Early Stage Investigator  (without 
NIH grant awards) in her sec ond year as an Assistant Professor (tenure  track) in the School of 
Nursing at Case Western Reserve University.

6 Data Collection and Procedures . Study v ariables, measures, and data collection points  are shown 
in Table 1  (page 5) . After consent is obtained, participants will be randomized to COACHMAN or 
EUC with a 1:1 ratio . At baseline and 12 week visits, we will conduct biometric health screening 
test (h eight, weight, and blood samples). A trained RA  will provide subjects assigned to 
COACHMAN a structured 30 -minute training session on how to use study website and Medisafe 
on smartphone. For those subjects assigned to EUC, the RA will provide education mat erials. 
Follow- up phone sessions on medication adherence and additional training will be provided by the 
CCBN trained as CHWs.  
Fide
lity of the intervention  “dose” (delivered, received, enacted) will be monitored  regularly 
throughout the study by obtaini ng measures  of subject responses to medication reminders, receipt 
of behavior change, and attendance to follow- up visit s.  
S
tatistical Analysis. For Aims 1 and 2,  focus group sessions and key informant interviews will be 
transcribed verbatim and analyz ed with NVivo 10 or a similar software package using principles 
of inductive content analysis. For Aim 3,  the primary analysis compares BP levels between the 
COACHMAN intervention and the EUC group across three  time points (baseline, 8 , and 12 
weeks). We will use a repeated measures analysis of variance (RMANOVA) built around a two  
group by three time points to assess mean differences across time, group differences, and the 
interaction of time X group.42  
 
Study Timeline.  Months 1-2 : Project start -up, finalize online web- based system, begin 
recruitment. Months 2-5 : Recruitment, randomization, enrollment; begin intervention delivery; 
Months 3-9:  Continue intervention delivery; data collection and system monitoring and retention; 
Months 9-12 : Data cleaning, analysis, dissemination.   
P
otential Problems and Alternative Strategies. Due to the pilot nature of this study, each 
participant will be required to use their own data plan. As noted in preliminary studies, a majority 
of participants own or have cell phones in our qualitative study. Thus, we expect few exclusions related to cell phone ownership.  Participants will receive a total of $215, which is intended to cover any costs incurred from cell phone usage, and overall study participati on. This pilot trial is 
intended to inform the design of a larger clinical trial, including its scalability, especially in terms of cost s that are not more than we anticipate , or pose a problem for participant or retention. Future 
trials will provide study  phones with prepaid data plans for those individual s with limited 
resources.

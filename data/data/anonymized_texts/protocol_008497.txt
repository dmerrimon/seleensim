Main Rationale for the Amendment  
The main rationale  for this amendment is to provide an optional booster dose with 
mRNA -1273.214, a bivalent (Omicron -containing) adaptation of the original COVID -19 vaccine  
(mRNA -1273)  used in this study , at least 3 months after Dose 2 to all participants who have not 
received a booster dose yet after their primary series with mRNA -1273.  
The summary of changes table provided below describes the major changes made to 
Amendment  9 relative to Amendment  8, including the sections modified and the corresponding 
rationales. The synopsis of the protocol  has been modified to correspond to changes in the body 
of the protocol. Minor copy edits and administrative updates were made throughout the protocol 
to align with new content as well as for clarity , readability  and/or accuracy.

3.1 (General Design)  Specified all participants who 
have not yet received a booster 
dose will be offered a booster 
dose with mRNA -1273.214 
(instead of mRNA -1273).  To provide an optional booster 
dose,  mRNA -1273.214, a  
bivalent (Omicron -containing) 
adaptation of the original 
COVID -19 vaccine 
(mRNA -1273) used in this 
study . 
Updated Table 4 to include  
mRNA -1273.214 in the column 
titled booster dose.  To state the doses for the 
mRNA -1273.214 optional

Added the text in the Study 
Progression section:  
Part 1 and  Part 2 participants 
who have not yet received a 
booster dose with mRNA -1273, 
nor a non -study vaccine booster 
dose  will be offered an optional 
booster dose lower than the 
chosen primary series for each 
age group (Table 4 ), at least 
3 months after Dose  2 of 
mRNA -1273.  To provide explanation that the 
optional booster dose , 
mRNA -1273.214 , will be at 
lower doses than the primary 
series.  
3.3 (Justification for Dose,

Overall Study Design  
This is a Phase 2/3, three -part, open -label, dose -escalation, age de -escalation and randomized, 
observer -blind, placebo -controlled expansion study intended to infer the effectiveness of 
messenger RNA [ mRNA ]-1273 in children aged 6 months to < 12 years. The study population 
will be divided into 3  age groups ( 6 years to < 12 years, 2 years to < 6 years, and 6 months to 
< 2 years), and up to 3 dose levels (25, 50, and 100 µg) of mRNA -1273 will be evaluated (and 
a third dose or an optional booster of 10 or 25 µg).  
The study will be conducted in 3 parts. Part 1 of the study will be open -label and consist of 
dose-escalation and age de -escalation in approximately 1,275 participants to select the dose for 
each age group with the highest number enrolled in the oldest age group. Part 2 of the study 
will be a placebo -controlled observer -blind evaluation of the s elected dose in up to 
12,000  participants (up to 4,000 participants each in the 6 years to < 12 years, 2 years to 
< 6 years, and the 6  months to < 2 years of age groups). Part 3 will be an open -label alternative 
dosing assessment in approximately 300 parti cipants in the 6 year to < 12 year old age group 
to assess reactogenicity and immunogenicity of a lower dose regimen. No participants in Part 
1 will participate in Part 2 or Part 3 of the study, and no participant in Part 2 will participate in 
Part 3 of th e study.  
In order to expedite the study of the safety of mRNA -1273 in school -aged children 6 years to 
< 12 years of age; Part 1 will enroll a total of approximately 375 participants per dose (both at 
the 50 and 100  µg dose levels) in this age group ( 6 years to < 12 years). The first 75 of these 
participants per dose will be included in the safety evaluation for dose -escalation and age de -
escalation as well as the immunogenicity assessment needed for dose selection, as applicable. 
Additionally, approximately  300 participants per dose will be enrolled to assess for any 
adverse event ( AE) occurring at 1% or higher. The sample size for Part 2 in this age group 
(6 years to < 12 years) will be adjusted to approximately 1700  participants. Conversely, 
approximately 75 participants in the middle age group ( 2 years to < 6 years) will be enrolled 
per dose in Part 1 for safety and dose selection and Part 2 will utilize the dose selected in Part 
ModernaTX, Inc.

Confidential  Page 14 1 to inform on AEs occurring at a frequency of 1% or greater. In the youngest  age group (6 
months to < 2 years), approximately 150  participants will be enrolled per dose in Part 1 for

Part 1 of the study will be open  label.  The study will begin with enrollment of approximately 
375 participants in the 6 years to < 12 years age group (Study Arm 1) and dosing with 50 µg 
of mRNA -1273. After at least 75  participants in Study Arm 1 have completed Day 8 (1 week 
after Dose 1 of mRNA -1273 50  µg), an internal safety team  (IST) will review the available 
safety data and provide a recommendation whether to escalate the dose to 100  µg in the 
6 years to < 12 years age group (Study  Arm 2; n = 375) and independently whether to begin 
dosing at the 50 -µg dose level in the 2 years to < 6 years age group (Study Arm 3; n = 75). 
After at least 75  participants in Study Arm  1 reach Day 36 (1 week after Dose 2 of 
mRNA -1273 50 µg), the IST wil l again review the available safety data and provide a 
recommendation whether to administer Dose 2 of mRNA -1273 100 µg in Study Arm 2 and 
whether to administer Dose 2 of mRNA -1273  50 µg in Study Arm 3. Simultaneously, the 
enrollment - of the remaining 300 planned participants for both Study Arm 1 and Study Arm 2 
will be ongoing. A preliminary safety and immunogenicity data review of Study Arm 1, and 
Study Arm 2 as applicable, will aid in the selection of a dose level for Part 2. Once a ll or a 
subset of participants from each of Study Arms 1 and 2 reach Day 57 (1 month after Dose 2 of 
mRNA -1273), an interim analysis may be conducted to review the safety and immunogenicity 
data. Cumulative safety data for approximately 300  participants at  the selected dose level will 
be reviewed by the Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) before enrollment in Part 2, and 
the DSMB safety review recommendation will enable the expansion of the 6 years to 
< 12 years age group (Part 2) to receive either mRNA -1273 at the selected dose level (Study 
Arm 8; n = 3,000) or placebo (Study Arm 9; n  = 1,000). The primary analysis of 
immunogenicity in Part  2 for Study Arm 8 (mRNA -1273 recipients) will be conducted after 
the pre -specified Immunogenicity Subset of participan ts reaches Day 57, and safety analysis 
will be conducted after a subset or all participants in Study Arms 8 and 9 reach Day 57.  
Part 3 of the study will be open  label. A total of approximately 300 participants in the 6 year to 
< 12 year old age group will be enrolled to receive 3 total doses of mRNA -1273 at 25 µg, 
given as the primary series doses at Day 1 and Day 29 followed by a third dose on Day  149/ 
ModernaTX, Inc.  
mRNA -1273 -P204 Protocol Amendment 9  mRNA -1273  
Confidential  Page 16 (BD) -Day 1 (at least 3 months and up to 5 months after the second dose in the primary series). 
The primar y analysis of immunogenicity and safety in Part 3 for Study Arm 14 will be 
conducted after all treated participants reach Day 57 (for primary series). The primary analysis 
of immunogenicity and safety for the third dose will be conducted after all particip ants who 
received a third dose reach Day  177/BD -Day 29.  
For the middle age group ( 2 years to < 6 years), progression in Part 1 will be as follows: After 
75 participants in Study Arm 3 have completed Day 8 (1 week after Dose  1 of mRNA -1273 
50 µg), an IST will review the available safety data and provide a recommendation whether to 
escalate the dose to 100 µg in the 2 years to < 6 years age group (Study Arm 4; n  = 75) and 
whether to begin dosing in the 6 months to < 2 years age group at the 25 -µg dose level (Study 
Arm 5; n = 150). After the 75  participants in Study Arm 3 reach Day 36 (1 week after Dose 2 
of mRNA -1273 50  µg), the IST will review the available safety data and provide a 
recommendation whether to administer Dose 2 of mRNA -1273 100  µg in Study Arm 4 and 
whether to administer Dose 2 of mRNA -1273 25  µg in Study Arm 5. An optional Arm 7 may 
be enrolled in this age group (approximately 75  participants) at the 25 -µg dose if the 100 -µg 
dose is eliminated at any point during dose -escalation process, to maintain dose ranging for 
this age group. A preliminary safety and immunogenicity data review of all applicable arms 
will aid in the selection of a dose level for Part 2. Once all or a subset of participants in all 
applicable arms reach Day 57 (1  month after Dose 2 of mRNA -1273), an interim analysis may 
be conducted to review safety and immunogenicity data. A preliminary safety and 
immunogenicity data review of all applicable arms will aid in the selection of a dose level for 
Part 2 and f or expansion of the 2 years to < 6 years age group (Part  2) to receive either 
mRNA -1273 at the selected dose level (Study Arm 10; n = up to 3,000) or placebo (Study 
Arm 11; n = up to 1,000). The primary analysis of immunogenicity in Part 2 for Study Arm  10 
(mRNA -1273 recipients) will be conducted after a pre -specified Immunogenicity Subset of 
participants reaches Day 57, and safety analysis will be conducted after a subset or all 
participants in Study Arms 10 and 11 reach Day  57. 
For the youngest age group (6 months to < 2 years) progression in Part 1 will be as follows: In 
Study Arm 5, after 150 participants have completed Day 8 (1 week after Dose 1 of 
mRNA -1273 25 µg), an IST will review the available safety data and provide a 
recommendation whether to esc alate the dose to 50 µg (Study Arm 6; n = 150). After the 
150 participants in Study Arm 5 reach Day  36 (1 week after Dose 2 of mRNA -1273 25  µg), 
the IST will review the available safety data and provide a recommendation whether to 
administer Dose 2 of mRNA -1273 50 µg in Study Arm  6. Once all or a subset of participants 
in Study Arms 5 and 6 reach Day 57 (1 month after Dose  2 of mRNA -1273), an interim 
analysis may be conducted to review the tolerability and immunogenicity data at each dose 
ModernaTX, Inc.  
mRNA -1273 -P204 Protocol Amendment 9  mRNA -1273  
Confidential  Page 17 level. A prelimina ry safety and immunogenicity data review of Study Arm 5  and Study Arm 6 , 
as applicable, will aid in the selection of a dose level for Part 2 and allow for expansion of the 
6 months to < 2 years age group (Part 2) to receive either mRNA -1273 at the selected  dose 
level (Study Arm  12; n  = up to 3,000) or placebo (Study Arm 13; n  = up to 1,000). The 
primary analysis of immunogenicity in Part 2 for Study Arm 12 (mRNA -1273 recipients) will 
be conducted after the pre -specified Immunogenicity Subset of participants  reaches Day  57, 
and safety analysis will be conducted after a subset or all participants in Study Arms  12 and 13 
reach Day 57.  
In general, if a decision is made not to proceed with administration of the higher dose and/or 
the second injection at a given d ose level (eg, due to safety concerns), the participants 
scheduled to receive the higher dose may receive a lower dose, and the participants who had 
received the higher dose level as their first injection will likely be given the next lower dose 
level that  was tolerated for their second injection. The dose level not tolerated in the older age 
group will not be administered in any of the younger age groups. Within an age group, if one 
of the dose levels is found to have an unacceptable tolerability profile, the age group may 
progress to Part 2 at a lower dose level.  
Part 1 and Part 2 participants who have not yet received a booster dose with mRNA -1273 , nor 
a non -study vaccine booster dose will be offered an optional booster dose of mRNA -1273.214 
lower than the chosen primary series for each age group , at least 3 months after Dose 2 of 
mRNA -1273.  
The final analysis will be performed when participants (Study Arms 1 to 14) conclude the 
safety follow -up at 12 months after their last dose (either Dose 2 or booste r dose).  
The goal of the study is to support an indication for use of mRNA -1273 50 or 100  µg IM, 
given as 2  injections, approximately 28 days apart (pandemic dosing) or for the use of mRNA -
1273 25  µg given as 3 injections, approximately 28 days (primary se ries) and at least 3  months 
and up to 5 months (third dose) apart (lower dosing) in the 6 years to < 12 years age group; 
mRNA -1273 25, 50, or 100 µg IM, given as 2  injections, approximately 28 days apart in the 
2 years to < 6 years age group; and mRNA -1273  25 or 50  µg IM, given as 2  injections, 
approximately 28 days apart in the 6  months to < 2 years age group. In addition, the study will 
provide support for the indication of a booster dose, given at the lower dosage level of the 
primary series, at least 6 months , as applicable,  after Dose 2. The basis for demonstrating 
vaccine effectiveness is proposed to be met by measuring serum antibody responses in the 
study participants. The approach to inferring vaccine effectiveness will depend on whether an 
accepted  serum antibody threshold conferring protection against coronavirus disease 2019 
(COVID -19) has been established. If an antibody threshold of protection has been established, 
effectiveness will be inferred based on the proportion of study participants with  serum 
ModernaTX, Inc.  
mRNA -1273 -P204 Protocol Amendment 9  mRNA -1273  
Confidential  Page 18 antibody levels (on Day  57) that meet or exceed the antibody threshold. If an antibody 
threshold of protection has not been established, effectiveness will be inferred by 
demonstrating noninferiority for each age group ( 6 years to < 12 years, 2 years to < 6 years, 
and 6  months to < 2 years in Study  P204) compared with young adult (18 to 25 years of age) 
participants enrolled in the ongoing clinical endpoint efficacy trial (Study  P301) by both 
geometric mean (GM) values and seroresponse rate  (SRR) . 
This study in children 6 months to < 12 years of age will monitor all participants for a total of 
12 months following the second dose of vaccine or placebo, or 12 months following their 
booster dose  or third dose , if applicable. Safety assessments will inclu de solicited adverse  
reactions ( ARs) 7 days after each injection (ie, the day of injection and 6 subsequent days), 
unsolicited AEs (28 days after each injection), and medically attended adverse events 
(MAAEs), serious adverse events ( SAEs ), and adverse eve nts of special interest (AESIs) 
(including multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children [MIS-C] and myocarditis and/or 
pericarditis) through the entire study period.  
Blood samples will be collected from participants in Part 1, Part 2, and Part 3 of the st udy for 
assessment of immunogenicity. If a Day 1 (baseline) blood sample cannot be obtained in either 
Part 1, Part 2, or Part 3, the participant will be considered either a screen failure due to 
inability to satisfy inclusion criterion 3 or could be resche duled for rescreening. Participants 
may be rescreened 1 time, either within the same screening period for Part 1 or Part 2 or in a 
new screening period of Part 2 or Part 3 if the initial screening was in Part 1 or Part  2, 
respectively. If the participant i s rescreened and a blood sample still cannot be obtained, then 
he/she will be considered a screen failure due to inability to satisfy inclusion criterion  3. Blood 
samples will also be tested for the development of antibodies directed against nonvaccine 
antigen (eg, antibodies against the nucleocapsid protein), which will signify infection with 
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS -CoV -2). The incidence of SARS -
CoV -2 infection among vaccine recipients and placebo recipients will be compared t o assess 
the potential for mRNA -1273 to reduce the rate of infection in vaccine recipients. In addition, 
all participants will be monitored for symptoms of COVID -19 and scheduled for illness visits 
if concerning symptoms occur, and a nasal swab will be col lected at the illness visit  while Part 
2 remains blinded for any age group. Once the trial is unblinded for all age groups and thus no 
placebo comparator group is available going forward, illness visits for COVID -19 symptoms 
or exposures and convalescent v isits will no longer be required.

Internal Safety Team  
An IST will  review safety data throughout Part 1 of the study. For Part 1 dose escalation and 
age de -escalation, based on the review of all available safety data through at least Day 8 
(1 week after Dose 1 of mRNA -1273) for at least 75 participants at each dose level  within the 
6 years to < 12 years and 2 years to < 6 years age group, the IST will recommend whether 
dose escalation and age de -escalation are appropriate. This process will then be repeated for all 
participants in the 25 and 50 µg dose levels within the l ower age group of 6 months to 
< 2 years of age. An IST review of all available safety data through at least Day 36 (1 week 
after Dose 2 of mRNA -1273 at each dose level) of at least 75 participants will be required 
prior to the administration of the second injection of the next higher dose. In addition, the IST 
will escalate any safety concerns to the DSMB. The frequency of IST meetings will be 
described in more detail in the IST charter.  
Data Safety Monitoring Board  
Safety oversight will be under the direction of a DSMB composed of external independent 
consultants with relevant expertise. Members of the DSMB will be independent from study 
conduct and free of conflict of interest. The DSMB will meet at pre -specified timepoints 
during the study to assess  safety throughout study conduct. For the 6 years to < 12 years age 
group, the DSMB will review cumulative safety data for approximately 300 participants 
enrolled at the selected dose level in Part 1 before enrollment begins in Part 2. For both the 
middle age group ( 2 years to < 6 years) and the youngest age group (6 months to < 2 years) the 
DSMB will review cumulative safety data in both younger age groups ( 2 years to < 6 years; 6 
months to < 2 years) combined and at all dose levels administered in Part 1 before start of Part 
2 (blinded phase) for each age group. The DSMB will operate under the rules of an approved 
charter that will be written and reviewed at the organizational meeting of the DSMB. Details 
regarding the DSMB composition, responsibilities, p rocedures, and frequency of data review 
will be defined in its charter.  
If any of the study pause rules  are met, the Sponsor will immediately suspend further 
enrollment and/or study dosing and the DSMB will convene on an ad hoc basis. The DSMB 
will review all available unblinded study data (as applicable) to help adjudicate any potential 
study pauses and make recommendations on further study conduct, including requesting 
additional information, recommending stopping the study, recommending changes to study 
conduct and/or the protocol, or recommending additional operational considerations due to

The C ardiac Event Adjudication Committee (CEAC)  consisting of pediatric and adult 
cardiologists will review suspected cases  of myocarditis, pericarditis, or myopericarditis to 
determine if they meet US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) criteria of 
“probable ” or “confirmed ” event, and to assess severity and enable the DSMB to make 
recommendations to the Sponsor t o continue vaccine dosing. The CEAC will operate under the 
rules of an approved charter that will be written and reviewed at the organizational meeting of 
the CEAC. Details regarding the CEAC composition, responsibilities, procedures, and 
frequency of data  review will be defined in its charter.  
In Part 2 (blinded phase), the Sponsor ’s medical monitor may escalate to the DSMB chair if 
any safety concerns are identified, as described in the DSMB charter.  
Study Duration: The study duration for each participan t will be variable depending on 
whether they choose to receive a booster  (or third dose  in Part 3)  or not; without a booster 
dose, it will be approximately 14 months, which includes 1 month for screening (Day -28 to 
Day -1), 1 month for dosing (on Day 1 and Day 29), and 12 months of follow -up after the 
second dose to monitor for safety, tolerability, reactogenicity, immunogenicity, and efficacy. 
With a booster dose given, the study duration will be up to 24 months.  
Number of Participants:  
Part 1: Approximately 1,275 participants (approximately 750 participants in the 6 years to 
< 12 years age group, approximately 225 participants 2 years to < 6 years age group, and 
approximately  300 participants in the 6  months to < 2 years age group) . 
Part 2: Up to 12,000 participants (up to 3,000 participants each exposed to mRNA -1273 and 
1,000  participants exposed to placebo in the 6 years to < 12 years, 2 years to < 6 years, and 6

Safety Assessments:  
Safety assessments will include monitoring and recording of the following for each participant  
as applicable per SoA . 
• Solicited local and systemic ARs that occur during the 7 days following each injection 
(ie, the day of injection and 6 subsequent days). Solicited ARs will be recorded daily 
using electronic diaries (eDiary).  
• Unsolicited AEs observed or reported during the  28 days following each injection (ie, 
the day of injection and 27 subsequent days).  
• AEs leading to discontinuation from dosing and/or study participation from Day  1 
through the last day of study participation.  
• MAAEs from first dose on Day  1 through the en tire study period.  
• SAEs from first dose on Day  1 through the entire study period.  
• AESIs including MIS -C and myocarditis and/or pericarditis, through the entire study 
period.  
• Physical examination findings.  
• Assessments for SARS -CoV -2 infection from Day  1 through study completion.  
• Details of all pregnancies in female participants will be collected after the start of study 
treatment and until the end of their participation in the study.  
Blood Collections for Immunogenicity Assessments  and Biomarker Samples : 
The following analytes will be measured in blood samples for immunogenicity assessments  
and biomarker samples : 
• Serum neutralizing antibody (nAb) titer against SARS -CoV -2 as measured by 
pseudovirus and/or live virus neutralization assays.  
• Serum binding antibod y (bAb) titer as measured by enzyme -linked immunosorbent 
assay specific to the SARS -CoV -2 S protein.  
• Serologic markers for SARS -CoV -2 infection using a nonvaccine antigen -based blood 
test. 
Efficacy Assessments:  
Vaccine effectiveness for children 6 months to < 12 years of age will be inferred based on 
ModernaTX, Inc.  
mRNA -1273 -P204 Protocol Amendment 9  mRNA -1273  
Confidential  Page 26 serum antibody responses obtained on Day 57 (28 days after the second injection of 
mRNA -1273). Inference will be based on assessing the antibody responses against th e 
following:  
1.  If available at the time of analysis , antibody responses will be assessed against an 
accepted serum antibody threshold conferring protection against COVID -19. 
2.  If an accepted threshold of protection is not available , noninferiority of the GM value 
of serum antibody and SRR  of children 6  months  old to < 12 years old (Study  P204) 
compared with the GM value of serum antibody and SRR  from young adults (18 to 25 
years of age) enrolled in the ongoing clinical endpoint efficacy trial (Study P301) wil l 
be assessed.  
Statistical Methods:  
Hypothesis Testing:  
If an accepted antibody threshold of protection against COVID -19 is established for the 
primary immunogenicity endpoint, the null hypothesis is that the percentage of participants on 
mRNA -1273 with serum antibody above the established threshold at Day  57 is ≤  70% 
(ie, H0: percentage of participants on mRNA -1273 with serum antibody at Day  57 above the 
established threshold ≤  70%).  
For each age group, the study will be considered to meet the immunogeni city endpoint if the 
95% confidence interval (CI) of percentage of participants on mRNA -1273 rules out 70% 
(lower bound of the 95% CI is >  70%).  
The null hypotheses may be updated when the information on an acceptable antibody 
threshold becomes available. In this case, the null hypothesis update will be provided in the 
statistical analysis plan (SAP) . 
If an accepted serum antibody threshold of protection against COVID -19 is not available for 
the primary immunogenicity endpoint, immune response as measured b y GM value and SRR  
in each age group based on Day 57 antibody levels will be compared with Day 57 antibody 
levels from young adults (18 to 25 years of age) in Study P301. Noninferiority tests of 2 null 
hypotheses based on 2 coprimary endpoints will be perf ormed, respectively.  
Part 1 or 2 Hypothesis Testing for Primary Series in Each Age Group  
Coprimary endpoint 1: antibody GM value at Day 57  
The null hypothesis H10: immunogenicity response to mRNA -1273, as measured by antibody 
GM value at Day 57, is inferior in children (in age groups 6 months to < 2 years, 2 years to 
ModernaTX, Inc.

Confidential  Page 27 < 6 years, and 6 years to < 12 years) compared with that in young adults (18 to 25  years of 
age) us ing mRNA -1273 Study  P301 data.  
The noninferiority in antibody GM value in an age group in children compared with that in 
young adults (18 to 25 years of age) is demonstrated by meeting both success criteria:  
- The lower bound of the 95%  CI of the geometric m ean ratio (GMR) ruling out 0.67 
(lower bound ≥ 0.67) using a noninferiority margin of 1.5, AND  
- The GMR point estimate ≥ 0.8 (minimum threshold).  
The GMR is the ratio of the GM value of SARS -CoV -2-specific antibody in children in an 
age group receiving mRNA -1273 in this Study P204 compared with the GM value of 
young adults (18 to 25 years of age) receiving mRNA -1273 in Study P301 at Day  57. 
Coprimary endpoint 2: antibody seroresponse rate at Day 57  
A definition of seroresponse will be provided in the SAP bas ed on forthcoming information 
about assay performance.  
The null hypothesis H20: immunogenicity response to mRNA -1273 as measured by SRR  at 
Day 57 is inferior in children compared with that in young adults (18 to 25 years of age) in 
Study  P301.  
The noninferiority in SRR  in an age group in children compared with that in young adults (18 
to 25  years of age) is demonstrated by meeting both success criteria:  
- The lower bound of the 95% CI of the SRR  difference ruling out -10% (ie, lower 
bound ≥ -10%) using the noninferiority margin of 10%, AND  
- The SRR  difference point estimate ≥ -5% (minimum threshold)  
The SRR  difference is defined as the SRR  in children receiving mRNA -1273 minus the 
SRR  in young adu lts of 18 to 25 years of age receiving mRNA -1273 from Study P301.  
The study would be considered to meet the primary immunogenicity endpoint in an age group 
if the noninferiority in the age group compared with the young adults (18 to 25 years of age) is 
demonstrated based on both coprimary endpoints.

The null hypothesis H20: immunogenicity response to mRNA -1273 booster dose as measured 
by SRR at BD -Day 29 in children in Study P204 is inferior compared with SRR at Day 57 
(28 days after Dose 2) following the primary series of mRNA -1273 in adults (18  to 25 years of

the noninferiority margin of 10%. The SRR difference is defined as the SRR at BD -Day 29 in 
Study P204 minus the rate at Day 57 (28 days after Dose  2) following the primary series of 
mRNA -1273 in adults in Study P301. The SRR is defined as a titer change from baseline (pre -
Dose 1) below the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) to ≥ 4 × LLOQ, or at least a 4 -fold 
rise if baseline is ≥ LLOQ.  
Booster dose primary immunogenicity objective for an age group in Part 2 will be considered 
to be met if the noninferiority in an age group compared with the adults (18 to 25 years of age) 
is demonstrated based on both coprimary endpoints.

Justification of using Immunogenicity Subset of adults (≥ 18 years of age) from Study P301 as 
a comparator for hypothesis testing  
In Phase 3 pivotal S tudy P301 with more than 30,000 participants enrolled, vaccine efficacy 
(VE)  against symptomatic COVID -19 based on adjudication committee assessment starting 
14 days after second injection in the per protocol  (PP) Set was demonstrated with VE estimate 
of 93.2% (95% CI: 91.0, 94.8) in adults ≥ 18 years in the final efficacy analysis (04 May 2021 
database lock) in the blinded phase. In a random sample stratified by baseline SARS -CoV -2 
status (negative vs. positive), age group ( < 65 vs. ≥ 65 years) and race/et hnicity (minority vs. 
non-minority), there were n=1055 participants ≥ 18 years of age in the PP Immunogenicity 
Subset who received mRNA -1273 100 µg with baseline negative SARS -CoV -2 status. The 
observed pseudovirus neutralizing antibody (PsVNA) ID50 geomet ric mean titers (GMT)  at 
Day 57 was 1081.1 (95% CI:  1019.8, 1146.1) for adults ≥ 18 years in Study P301.  
A separate random subset of young adults 18 to 25 years of age from Study P301 (n=305 in 
the PP Immunogenicity Subset receiving mRNA -1273 100 µg, of wh ich n=296 have PsVNA 
assay results reported at Day 57) was selected for the purpose of immunobridging adolescents 
in Study P203 and children in Study P204 to young adults in Study P301. This subset of young 
adults with observed PsVNA ID50 GMT of 1301.3 (95 % CI: 1172.3, 1444.5)  at Day 57  was 
planned and used as a comparator in the primary immunogenicity analysis testing the 
noninferiority of immunogenicity in adolescents in Study P203 and children in Study P204.  
The observed Day 57 GMT of 1301.3 in young adu lts 18 to 25 years is approximately 1.2 -fold 
higher compared with 1081.1 in adults ≥ 18 years of age with high VE established (VE

mRNA -1273 -P204 Protocol Amendment 9  mRNA -1273  
Confidential  Page 31 estimate of 93.2% [95% CI: 91.0, 94.8]). The data suggest that adults ≥ 18 years of age may 
also be considered as a reference for immunobridging analyses.  
If a comparator age group of adults ≥ 18 years from Study P301 is used in a primary 
immunogenicity noninferiority hypothesis testing for children in Study P204, a sensitivity 
analysis may be performed by using different age group(s) (eg, 18 to 25 years, ≥ 65 years) 
from Study  P301 as a comparator.  
Power and Sample Size:  
The initial age groups in Part 1 are for estimation purposes. With approximately 750 
participants (approximately 375 participants at each dose level of mRNA -1273) in the initial 
6 years to < 12 years age group, there is at least a 90% probability to observ e at least 1 
participant with an AE at a true AE rate of 1% for a given dose level. In each of the younger 
age groups ( 2 years to < 6 years and 6  months to < 2 years), the safety assessment will occur 
during the conduct of Part  2 after approximately 375 pa rticipants have been exposed to 
mRNA -1273 at the dose level selected for Part 2.  
The sample size in the expansion (Part 2) is considered to be sufficient to support a safety 
database in the pediatric participants 6 months to < 12 years of age. With up to 
3,000 participants each in the 6 years to < 12 years, 2 years to < 6 years, and 6 months to 
< 2 years of age groups exposed to mRNA -1273 at a given dose level in Part 2, the study has 
at least a 95% probability to observe at least 1 participant with an AE a t a true 0.1% AE rate 
for a given dose level.  
The sample size in the lower dosing assessment (Part 3) is approximately 300 children 6 years 
to < 12 years of age receiving mRNA -1273 25  µg. There is at least a 90% probability to 
observe at least 1 participan t with an AE at a true AE rate of 1% in this group.  
A subset of Full Analysis Set (FAS) participants (Immunogenicity Subset) in each age group 
will be selected for measuring immunogenicity data. The immunogenicity samples of the 
Immunogenicity Subset will be processed, and the analysis of primary immunogenicity 
endpoint will be based on the PP Immunogenicity Subset.  
If a threshold of protection is available, for the primary immunogenicity endpoint, with 
approximately 289 participants on mRNA -1273 in the PP Immunogenicity Subset of an age 
group, there will be at least 90% power to rule out 70% with a 2 -sided 95% CI (lower bound 
of the 95%  CI > 70%) for the percentage of mRNA -1273 participants exceeding the accepted 
threshold if the true rate of participants e xceeding the threshold is 80%.  
If an acceptable antibody threshold of protection against COVID -19 is not available at the 
time of analysis for the primary immunogenicity endpoint, noninferiority tests of the 2 null

• Assuming approximately 25% of participants in the Immunogenicity Subset in Part 2 
will not meet the criteria to be included in the PP Immunogenicity  Subset, 
approximately 528 participants in Part 2 (~396 receiving mRNA -1273 and ~132

Immunogenicity Analyses:  
The primary analysis population f or immunogenicity will be the PP Immunogenicity Subset, 
unless specified otherwise. The primary objective of this study is to use the immunogenicity 
response to infer efficacy in participants aged 6 months to < 12 years at the dose level selected 
for expan sion. For this objective, analyses of immunogenicity will be performed for each 
pediatric age group separately at the selected dose level based on the participants in the PP 
Immunogenicity Subset. For each pediatric age group, participants in the applicabl e study part 
in the PP Immunogenicity Subset may be used for immunogenicity primary analysis. 
Participants from Part 1 and Part 2 who receive the same mRNA -1273 dose level selected for 
expansion may be combined for immunogenicity analyses. If the same dose  level is selected 
for expansion for more than one age group, these age groups may be combined for 
immunogenicity analyses.  
An accepted antibody threshold of protection against COVID -19 may be available based on 
data from other mRNA -1273 studies or externa l data. If such a threshold of protection against 
COVID -19 is available, the number and percentage of participants with antibody greater than 
or equal to the threshold at Day  57 will be provided with a 2 -sided 95% CI using the 
Clopper -Pearson method. For a n age group, if the lower bound of the 95% CI on the 
mRNA -1273 group is > 70%, the primary immunogenicity endpoint of this study will be 
considered to be met for that age group.  
The number and percentage of participants with serum antibody greater than or equal to the 
threshold with 2 -sided 95% CI will be provided at each postbaseline time point. The CI will be 
calculated using the Clopper -Pearson method.

mRNA -1273 -P204 Protocol Amendment 9  mRNA -1273  
Confidential  Page 37 If an accepted serum antibody threshold of protection against COVID -19 is not established, 
immune respo nse as measured by GM value and SRR  in each age group based on Day 57 
antibody levels will be compared with that in young adults (18 to 25 years of age) using data 
from Study P301. An analysis of covariance model will be carried out with antibody at Day 57  
as dependent variable and a group variable (a pediatric age group in Study  P204 versus young 
adults [18 to 25 years of age] in Study P301) as the fixed variable for each pediatric age group. 
The GM values of the pediatric age group at Day 57 will be estim ated by the geometric least 
square mean (GLSM) from the model. The GMR (ratio of GM values) will be estimated by the 
ratio of GLSM from the model. The corresponding 2 -sided 95% CI will be provided to assess 
the difference in immune response between the ped iatric age group (Study  P204) compared 
with the young adults (18 to 25 years of age) in Study P301 at Day 57. For each pediatric age 
group, the noninferiority of GM value will be considered demonstrated if:  
- The lower bound of the 95% CI of the GMR is ≥ 0.6 7 based on the noninferiority 
margin of 1.5, AND  
- The GMR point estimate > 0.8 (minimum threshold).  
For Part 1 or Part 2 booster dose primary immunogenicity analysis of GM in children 
receiving mRNA -1273 booster dose, an analysis of covariance model will be  performed to 
assess the difference in  the immune response (Ab level) between  BD-Day 29 in children 
receiving mRNA -1273 booster dose in Study P204  and Day 57 in young adults  (≥ 18-25 years  
of age ) receiving mRNA -1273 primary series in Study  P301 . In the analysis of covariance 
model, antibody titers at BD-Day 29 in P204 children and titers at Day 57 in P301  young 
adults  will be a dependent  variable, and a group variable (children in Study P204  and young 
adults in Study P301 ) will be the fixed effect.  The GMT will be estimated by the GLSM from 
the model , and its corresponding 95% CI will be provided for each group. The GMR (ratio of 
GMTs) for children in Study P204  with respect to young adults in Study P301  will be 
estimated by the ratio of GLSM from the mo del and the corresponding 95% CIs will be 
provided. The 95% CI for GMR will be used to assess the between -group difference in 
immune response at BD -Day 29 in children in Study P204  compared with Day 57 following 
the primary vaccine series in young adults i n Study P301.  The noninferiority of post -booster 
GM in children will be considered demonstrated if the lower bound of the 95% CI of the GMR 
is ≥ 0.67 based on the noninferiority margin of 1.5.  
For Part 3 primary series primary immunogenicity analysis of GM  in children 6 years to 
< 12 years of age receiving mRNA -1273 25 µg , which is half of the 50 µg dose level used in 
Part 2 for the same age group, the noninferiority hypothesis testing of GM in children 
compared with adults ≥  18 years of age from Study P301 will be performed using an analysis 
of covariance model as describe d above. The noninferiority of GM in children in Part 3 will be

the noninferiority margin of 1.5, where the 1 -alpha can be 97.5% or 95% depending on the 
alpha leve l of 0.025 or 0.05 used for the hypothesis testing. A sensitivity analysis may be 
conducted by using different age group(s) (eg, 18 to 25 years, ≥  65 years) from Study  P301 as 
a comparator.  
For Part 3 third dose primary immunogenicity analysis of GM in chi ldren receiving a third 
mRNA -1273 dose, an analysis of covariance model will be performed to assess the difference 
in the immune response at BD -Day 29 between children receiving mRNA -1273 third dose in 
Study P204 and Day 57 in adults (≥18 years of age) rec eiving mRNA -1273 primary series  in 
Study  P301. In the analysis of covariance model, antibody titers at BD -Day 29 in P204 
children and titers at Day 57 in P301  young adults  will be a dependent variable, and a group 
variable (children in Study  P204 and adult s in Study  P301) will be the fixed effect. The GMT 
will be estimated by the GLSM from the model , and its corresponding 95% CI will be 
provided for each group. The GMR for children in Study  P204 with respect to adults in Study  
P301 will be estimated by the ratio of GLSM from the model and the corresponding 95% CIs 
will be provided. The 95% CI for GMR will be used to assess the between -group difference in 
immune response at BD -Day 29 in children in Study  P204 compared with Day 57 after the 
primary vaccination series in adults in Study  P301.  The noninferiority of post -third dose GM 
in children will be considered demonstrated if the lower bound of the (1 -alpha) CI of the GMR 
is ≥ 0.67 based on the noninferiority margin of 1.5.  
The number and percentag e of participants with seroresponse due to vaccination will be 
provided with 2 -sided 95% CI using the Clopper -Pearson method at each postbaseline time 
point with Day  57 being of the primary interest in the analyses for the mRNA -1273 primary 
series in Part  1 or Part 2. The SRR  difference with 95% CI (using Miettinen -Nurminen score 
method) at Day 57 will be provided between children receiving mRNA -1273 primary series in 
Study P204 Part 1 or Part 2 and young adults of 18 to 25  years of age receiving mRNA -1273 
primary series in Study P301. For each pediatric age group in Part 1 or Part 2, the 
noninferiority of SRR  will be considered demonstrated if:  
- The lower bound of the 95% CI of the SRR  difference is ≥ -10% based on the 
noninferiority margin of 10%, AND  
- The SRR difference point estimate ≥ -5% (minimum threshold).  
For Part 1 or Part 2 booster dose primary immunogenicity analysis of seroresponse in children 
receiving mRNA -1273 booster dose  (as applicable) , the SRR with 95% CI (using Clopper -

age) in Study  P301 will be computed. The SRR is defined as a titer change from baseline (pre -
Dose 1) below the LLOQ to ≥ 4 × LLOQ, or at least a 4 -fold rise if baseline is ≥ LLOQ. The 
noninferiority of SRR in children receiving mRNA -1273 booster dose will be considered  
demonstrated if the lower bound of the 95% CI of the SRR difference is ≥ -10% based on the 
noninferiority margin of 10%.  
For Part 3 primary series primary immunogenicity analysis of seroresponse in children 6 to 
< 12 years of age receiving mRNA -1273 25 µg  which is half of the 50 µg dose level used in 
Part 2 for the same age group, the noninferiority hypothesis testing of SRR in children 
compared with adults ≥ 18 years of age from Study P301 will be performed using the analysis 
of SRR as described above. Th e SRR  difference with (1 -alpha) CI at Day 57 will be provided 
between children receiving mRNA -1273 primary series in Study P204 Part 3 and adults of ≥ 
18 years of age receiving mRNA -1273 primary series in Study P301. The 1 -alpha can be 
97.5% or 95% dependi ng on the alpha level of 0.025 or 0.05 used for the hypothesis testing. 
The noninferiority of SRR in children receiving mRNA -1273 25 µg primary series in Part 3 
will be considered demonstrated if the lower bound of the (1 -alpha) CI of the SRR difference 
is ≥ -10% based on the noninferiority margin of 10%. A sensitivity analysis may be conducted 
by using different age group(s) (eg, 18 to 25 years, ≥  65 years) from Study P301 as a 
comparator.  
For Part 3 third dose primary immunogenicity analysis of serorespon se in children receiving a 
third dose of mRNA -1273, the SRR with (1 -alpha) CI (using Clopper -Pearson method) will be 
summarized, where the 1 -alpha can be 97.5% or 95% depending on the alpha level of 0.025 or 
0.05 used for the hypothesis testing. The SRR di fference with (1 -alpha)% CI (using Miettinen -
Nurminen score method) to compare post -third dose SRR at BD -Day 29 in children in Study 
P204 with the primary series SRR at Day 57 (28 days after Dose 2) in adults (≥ 18 years of 
age) in Study P301 will be compu ted. The SRR is defined as a titer change from baseline (pre -
Dose 1) below the LLOQ to ≥  4 × LLOQ, or at least a 4 -fold rise if baseline is ≥ LLOQ. The 
noninferiority of SRR in children receiving a third dose of mRNA -1273 in Part 3 will be 
considered demon strated if the lower bound of the (1 -alpha) CI of the SRR difference is ≥ -
10% based on the noninferiority margin of 10%.  
In addition, the GM value of anti -SARS -CoV -2-specific antibody with corresponding 95% CI 
will be provided at each time point. The 95% CIs will be calculated based on the t -distribution 
of the log -transformed values then back transformed to the original scale. For each age group,

maximum will also  be provided.  
Multiplicity Adjustment Between Age Groups:  
A hierarchical sequential hypothesis testing (fixed -sequence method) will be used to adjust 
multiplicity to preserve the family -wise Type I error rate (alpha = 0.05), starting with the 
oldest age gr oup, followed by the middle age group, and then followed by the youngest age 
group. The primary series immunogenicity coprimary endpoint hypotheses for the oldest age 
group ( 6 years to < 12 years of age) will be tested first at alpha level of 0.05 in Part 1 
expansion  or Part 2 . If the testing in the oldest age group is statistically significant (meeting 
the noninferiority success criteria of the coprimary endpoints), the alpha level of 0.05 will be 
passed to the testing of the primary series coprimary endpo int hypotheses in the middle age 
group ( 2 years to < 6 years of age) in Part 2. If the testing in the middle age group is 
statistically significant at alpha level of 0.05, then the alpha 0.05 is preserved for testing the 
primary series coprimary endpoint h ypotheses in the youngest age group (6  months to 
< 2 years of age) in Part 2.  
If the hypothesis testing is statistically significant for all the primary series primary 
immunogenicity endpoints in Part 2, the alpha 0.05 is preserved for the hypothesis testi ng for 
the booster dose primary immunogenicity endpoint in Part 1 or Part 2, starting in the oldest 
age group ( 6 years to < 12 years of age), then the middle age group ( 2 years to < 6 years of 
age), followed by the youngest age group (6  months to < 2 years of age) for booster dose in 
appli cable age groups in Part 1 or Part 2. The testing will continue through the sequence only 
until an endpoint is not statistically significant (did not meet specified noninferiority success 
criteria of any primary endpoint) in Part 1 or Part 2, in which case the testing will stop. If the 
hypothesis testing for all the booster dose primary endpoints in Part 1 or Part 2 is statistically 
significant (meeting the noninferiority success criteria of the primary endpoints), the alph a 
level of 0.05 will be passed to the hypothesis testing in Part  3. 
In Part 3, half of the type I error rate 0.05 by alpha -splitting will be initially allocated to the 
hypothesis testing for the primary series immunogenicity coprimary endpoints, which will  be 
tested initially at alpha level of 0.025. The second 0.025 will be reserved for Part 3 third dose 
hypothesis testing, and a fallback method will be used if applicable.  
• If the testing of the primary series coprimary endpoints in Part 3 is statistically significant 
at alpha level of 0.025 (meeting the noninferiority success criteria of the coprimary 
endpoints), a total of alpha 0.05 will be preserved for the hypothesis testing of the Part 3 
third dose immunogenicity coprimary endpoints.  
ModernaTX, Inc.  
mRNA -1273 -P204 Protocol Amendment 9  mRNA -1273  
Confidential  Page 41 • If the hypothesis testing of the primary series coprimary endpoints in Part 3 is not 
statistically significant at alpha level of 0.025 (not meeting any of the specific 
noninferiority success criteria of the coprimary endpoints), the remaining alpha level of 
0.025 reserved w ill be used for the hypothesis testing of the Part 3 third dose 
immunogenicity coprimary endpoints. Further, if the hypothesis testing of the third dose 
coprimary endpoints in Part 3 is statistically significant at alpha level of 0.025, the unused 
alpha 0. 025 will be passed back to re -testing of primary series coprimary endpoint 
hypothesis in Part 3 at alpha level of 0.025+0.025=0.05 (a fallback method).  
Efficacy Analyses:  
To evaluate the incidence of COVID -19 after vaccination with mRNA -1273 or placebo, th e 
incidence rate will be provided by vaccination group, dose level, and age group, calculated as 
the number of cases divided by the total person -time. Participants in Part 1 and Part 2 of the 
study and in different age groups who receive the same mRNA -1273  dose level (if applicable) 
may be combined in the analysis.  
For serologically confirmed SARS -CoV -2 infection or COVID -19, regardless of 
symptomatology or severity, infection rate will be provided by vaccination group, dose level,

The secondary efficacy analyses will be performed on the PP Set, with sensitivity analyses in 
FAS, modified Intent -to-Treat ( mITT ) Set, and modified Intent -to-Treat -1 (mITT1 ) Set. 
Analyses of  the efficacy endpoints in Part 2 will be performed for the randomized blinded 
phase. Additional exploratory analyses will be conducted in the blinded and unblinded phases 
for participants randomized to mRNA -1273 in Part 2, and in the unblinded phase for 
participants who are originally randomized to the placebo arm and cross -over to mRNA -1273

1.1 Study Rationale  
Coronaviruses (CoVs) are a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common 
cold to more severe diseases, such as Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and severe 
acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Coronaviruses are zoonotic, meaning that they are 
transmitted between animals and people. An outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019  (COVID -
19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  (SARS -CoV -2) began in Wu han, 
Hubei Province, China in December 2019 and has spread throughout China and to over 215 other 
countries, territories, and areas, including the United States ( WHO  2020a ). On 11  Mar 2020, the 
World Health Organization (WHO) o fficially declared COVID -19 a pandemic. As of 
30 Jan 2021, the WHO dashboard ( WHO  2020b ) reported that there have been more than 2.1 
million COVID -19 deaths worldwide. As of 29  Jan 2021, the US Centers for Disease Control 
and P revention (CDC) reported over 25 million cases of COVID -19 in all 50 states and 5 
jurisdictions, with 431,619  attributed and probable deaths (CDC  2020a ). While the CDC reports 
that the highest risk of disease burden is in older  adults and populations with certain underlying 
comorbid conditions such as heart disease, diabetes, and lung disease, a substantial burden in 
children is now being recognized. Evidence is emerging (described below) to suggest that 
children <  18 years of a ge, particularly adolescents, may be disproportionately contributing to 
the number of new cases as schools re -open at varying degrees of in -person learning. As of 
29 Jan 2021, the CDC reported 2,125,186 cases of COVID -19 in children less than 18  years of 
age (11.1% of all US cases) and 267  deaths (approximately  0.1% of all US deaths; CDC  2020b ). 
During incubation, those infected can also transmit the virus before developing symptoms 
(Chen  et al 202 0). Person -to-person transmission occurs primarily via direct contact or through 
droplets spread by coughing or sneezing from an infected individual, whether symptomatic or 
not (Chen  et al 2020 ; Licciardi et al 2020 ; Rothan and Byrareddy 2020 ; Shen et al 2020 ). 
SARS -CoV -2 can also be transmitted via the fecal -oral pathway ( Cruz and Zeichner 2020 ). 
During the COVID -19 pandemic, children throughout much of the world have had school 
attendance limited in an attempt to control infection. Therefore, the main source of infection for 
SARS -CoV -2 in children, with or without clinical symptoms, is infected household contacts.  
Indeed, a retrospective cohort study of high school students, parents and siblings of students, 
teachers, and staff conducted in France in early April 2020 suggests that there was little to no 
transmission from infected students to other students or schoo l staff. Rather, a high prevalence of 
antibodies against SARS -CoV -2 among families suggests familial clustering of COVID -19 cases 
(Fontanet  et al 2020 ). 
ModernaTX, Inc.  
mRNA -1273 -P204 Protocol Amendment 9  mRNA -1273  
Confidential  Page 54 A recent report of COVID -19 trends in school -aged children in the United States from 
01 Mar 2020 to 19  Sep 2020 indicates that 37% of laboratory -confirmed cases of COVID -19 in 
school -aged children occurred in children 5 to 11 years of age while 63% occurred in adolescents 
12 to 17  years of age ( Leeb e t al 2020 ). The weekly incidence among adolescents was 37.4 cases 
per 100,000 compared with 19.0 cases per 100,000 for younger children. Among school -aged 
children with laboratory -confirmed COVID -19, 58% reported at least one symptom and 5% 
reported no sym ptoms, although information on symptoms was missing or unknown for 37%. 
Overall, 1.2% of school -aged children with COVID -19 were hospitalized, 0.1% required 
intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and <  0.01% died of COVID -19. Furthermore, at least one 
underl ying condition was reported in 3% of adolescents and 2% of younger children. Chronic 
lung disease, including asthma, was most commonly reported (55%), followed by disability 
(neurologic or neurodevelopmental disorders, intellectual or physical disability, and vision or 
hearing impairment; 9%), immunosuppressive conditions (7%), diabetes (6%), psychological 
conditions (6%), cardiovascular disease (5%), and severe obesity (4%) ( Leeb  et al 2020 ). Based 
on the COVID -NET report, in 42. 3% of children with at least 1 underlying condition, the most 
prevalent conditions were obesity (37.8%), chronic lung disease (18.0%), and prematurity 
(15.4%) ( Kim et al 2020 ). Of particular interest is the phenomenon known as  multisystem 
inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS -C) (PICS 2020 ). Since those early reports, a number of 
articles have been published describing a hyperinflammatory syndrome with features of 
Kawasaki disease in children and a dolescents infected with SARS -CoV -2 (Belhadjer et al 2020 ; 
Dufort et al 2020 ; Verdoni et al 2020 ). Targeted surveillance in the United States from March 
through May 2020 revealed 186  patients across 26 states who met a pre -specified case definition 
of MIS -C (Feldstein  et al 2020 ). The median age was 8.3 years (interquartile range: 3.3 to 12.5 
years). Most (73%) were previously healthy, and 70% were positive for SARS -CoV -2 by reverse 
transcriptase polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR) or antibody testing. The condition affected a 
variety of organ systems, most commonly the gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, hematologic, 
mucocutaneous, and res piratory systems. More recently, the Brighton Collaboration has drafted a 
manuscript proposing case definitions of MIS -C based on 5 levels of diagnostic certainty ( Vogel 
et al 2020 ). 
Evidence suggests that there is substantial b urden of COVID -19 in younger age groups. Another 
study examined the age distribution of COVID -19 in the United States from May to August 2020 
based on 3 indicators: COVID -19-like illness -related emergency department visits, positive 
RT-PCR results for SARS -CoV -2, and confirmed COVID -19 cases ( Boehmer et al 2020 ). These 
authors report an estimated mean COVID -19 incidence during this time period of 179.3 cases per 
100,000 in individuals 10 to 19  years of age. Finally, a recent re port describes an adolescent 
(13 year old female), whose only symptom was nasal congestion, yet she was the index case in 
an outbreak of COVID -19 linked to a family gathering that ultimately crossed 4  states and 
ModernaTX, Inc.  
mRNA -1273 -P204 Protocol Amendment 9  mRNA -1273  
Confidential  Page 55 included 5  households and 11  individuals ( Schwartz et al 2020 ). A June COVID -19 outbreak in a 
Georgia overnight camp demonstrated that children 6 to 19 years of age are susceptible to 
SARS -CoV -2 infection and transmission ( Szablewski et  al 2020 ). In addition, in the second half 
of July, Rhode Island childcare programs reported 52 confirmed and probable childcare -
associated COVID -19 cases, 30 (58%) cases of which were among children with a median age of 
5 years ( Link -Gelles  et al 2020 ). This suggests that adolescents and children can serve as the 
source of COVID -19 outbreaks, even when their symptoms are mild, as in these cases.  
There is currently no approved vaccine against SARS -CoV -2 for children. In Decem ber 2020, 
following review of safety and efficacy data observed to date, the Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA) granted Emergency Use Authorization  (EUA)  to 2 messenger RNA ( mRNA )-based 
SARS -CoV -2 vaccines, including mRNA -1273, for adults.  In January 2022,  the FDA has 
approved the Biologics License Application (BLA) for SPIKEVAX (mRNA -1273) to prevent 
COVID -19 in individuals 18 years of age and older.  In October 2021, the FDA granted EUA to 
an mRNA -based SAR S-CoV -2 vaccine in children aged 5 to 11  years old . To address prevention 
of pediatric COVID -19 as well as to potentially help curb SARS -CoV -2 transmission, there is an 
urgent public health need for rapid development of SARS -CoV -2 vaccines in children.  
The objective for this Phase 2/3 study is to evaluate  the safety, tolerability, reactogenicity, and 
effectiveness of up to 3 dose levels (25, 50, and 100  µg) of mRNA -1273 vaccine administered as 
2 doses 28  days apart  (and an optional booster dose  at 10 or 25 µg) (Section  3.1) to healthy 
children 6 months to < 12 years of age divided into 3 age groups ( 6 years to < 12 years, 2  years  
to < 6 years, and 6 months to < 2 years) , as well as a lower dose three -dose series of 25 µ g in 
children 6 years to < 12 years  old. Another Phase  2/3 study to evaluate the safety and 
reactogenicity of a single dose level (100  µg) of mRNA -1273 vaccine administered as 2  doses 
28 days apart to an adolescent population (12 t o < 18 years of age)  as well as a booster dose  is 
ongoing.  
1.1.1 Background  and Overview  
The Sponsor has developed a rapid -response proprietary vaccine platform based on a mRNA 
delivery system. The platform is based on the principle and observations that cells in vivo  can 
take up mRNA, translate it, and then present viral antigen(s) on the cell surface. The delivered 
mRNA does not enter the cellular nucleus or interact with the genome, is nonreplicating, and is 
expressed transiently. Messenger RNA vaccines have b een used to induce immune responses 
against infectious pathogens such as cytomegalovirus ( [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ), human metapneumovirus 
and parainfluenza virus type  3 ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ), and influenza virus ( [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  and 
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ).

Confidential  Page 56 The Sponsor is using its mRNA -based platform to develop a novel lipid nanoparticle 
(LNP) -encapsulated mRNA -based vaccine against SARS -CoV -2 (mRNA -1273). mRNA -1273  
encodes for the full -length spike (S) protein of SARS -CoV -2, modified to introduce 2 proline 
residues to stabilize the S  protein (S2P). It has been confirmed that the stabilized SARS -CoV -2 
S2P expresses well and is in the prefusion conformation ( Wrapp  et al 2020 ). The CoV S  protein 
mediates attachment and entry of the virus into host cells (by fusion), making it a primary target 
for neutralizing antibodies (nAb) that prevent infection ( Corti et al 2015 ; Wang et al 2015 ; 
Yu et al 2015 ; Johnson et al 2016 ; Chen et al 2017 ; Wang  et al 2018 ; Kim et al 2019 ; 
Widjaja  et al 2019 ; Corbett et al 2020a ; Ju et al 2020 ; Robbiani et al 2020 ). 
1.1.2 Nonclinical Studies  
The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) Vaccine Research Center and 
the Sponsor performed nonclinical studies in young and aged wild -type mice, Syrian Golden 
hamsters, and rhesus macaques (nonhuman primates [NHPs]) to evaluate dos e-ranging responses 
to mRNA -1273 (immunogenicity) and high -dose virus SARS -CoV -2 challenge (protection) and 
to address the theoretical concern of enhanced respiratory disease (ERD) mediated by 
vaccine -induced antibody responses and/or T helper cell (Th) 2 -directed T -cell responses 
observed with other vaccines against viral respiratory diseases ( Graham 2020 ). 
Nonclinical animal studies demonstrated that mRNA -1273 is immunogenic in all species 
assessed, with a dose -dependent respo nse in immunoglobulin G (IgG) binding antibody (bAb) 
titers and a correlation that is statistically significant between bAb and nAb activity. In addition, 
antigen -specific T -cell responses were observed in studies in mice and NHPs. The Th1 -directed 
cluster  of differentiation (CD) 4 and CD8 T -cell responses were measured after boost in animals 
that were vaccinated with mRNA -1273. In various animal models, immunological measurements 
suggested that Th1 responses predominated, IgG2a/c/IgG1 ratios were favorable , and high levels 
of SARS -CoV -2 nAb were observed, suggesting that ERD after mRNA -1273 administration 
would be unlikely . In addition to measuring the immune response, mice, hamsters, and NHPs 
were challenged with high -dose SARS -CoV -2 virus. In these studie s, dose levels were included 
that were predicted to be optimal (fully protective) and suboptimal (subprotective). At higher 
doses, mice and NHPs were fully protected from viral replication in both lungs and nasal 
passages. At subprotective dose levels, ani mals either remained fully protected or had reduced 
viral lung burden post challenge versus control animals ( Corbett et al 2020a ; Corbett et al 
2020b ). 
Overall, nonclinical animal studies d emonstrated that mRNA -1273 is safe and well tolerated, is 
immunogenic, fully protects animals from challenge at optimal dose levels, and does not result in 
ERD at protective or subprotective dose levels.

proprietary lipid used in the mRNA -1273 LNP formulation.  
A detailed review of nonclinical experience with mRNA -1273 vaccine is provided in the 
investigator’s brochure (IB).  
1.1.3 Clinical Studies  
The mRNA -1273 vaccine is currently bei ng evaluated in 4 ongoing trials.  
The first is a safety and immunogenicity Phase 1 study ( [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ) sponsored and 
conducted by the Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (DMID; investigational new 
drug [IND] app lication 019635) of the NIAID. The Phase  1 study is an open -label dose -ranging 
study of mRNA -1273 in healthy adult male and nonpregnant female participants in 3  age groups: 
18 to 55 years, inclusive (60  participants); 56  to 70  years, inclusive (30  particip ants); and 
≥ 71 years (30  participants). Participants were randomly assigned to 1 of 4  dose levels of 
mRNA -1273: 25  μg, 50  μg, 100  μg, and 250  μg. Each participant received the same dose by 
intramuscular (IM) injection (0.5  mL) of mRNA -1273 on Days  1 and 2 9 in the deltoid muscle. 
Blood samples were obtained at baseline, Days 8, 15, 29 (prior to Dose 2), 36, 43, and 57, as 
well as 3, 6, and 12 months after the second vaccination (Days 119, 209, and 394, respectively). 
Safety monitoring is ongoing for 12  mont hs after the second injection.  
On 14 Jul 2020, a preliminary report of findings in this Phase 1 study through Day  57 for the 
18- to 55 -year age -cohort (25, 100, and 250 µg dosage groups) was published ( Jackson et al 
2020 ). After the second injection, serum viral neutralizing activity was detected by 2 methods in 
all 42  participants evaluated (of 45 enrolled), with values that were comparable to or greater than 
the geometric mean titers (GMT) measured in the convalescent s erum samples. Regarding safety, 
no serious adverse events (SAEs) were reported and no study -halting rules were triggered. In 
general, solicited systemic adverse reactions ( ARs) were more common after the second 
injection. Solicited ARs that occurred in mor e than half the participants included fatigue, chills, 
headache, myalgia, and pain at the injection site. While none of the participants (N=  45) at any 
dose level experienced fever following the first dose, mild fever was observed in 5  participants 
(33%), moderate fever was observed in 1 participant (6.7%), and no participants experienced 
severe fever at 100  µg following the second dose. Data on 40 older adults > 55  years of age who 
received 2  doses of either 25 or 100  µg in the same Phase 1 DMID study were  recently published 
(Anderson  et al 2020 ). After the second injection, serum neutralizing activity was detected in all 
participants by multiple methods with binding and neutralizing antibody titers similar to those 
ModernaTX, Inc.  
mRNA -1273 -P204 Protocol Amendment 9  mRNA -1273  
Confidential  Page 58 reported i n adults 18 to 55  years of age and above the median for convalescent serum. Solicited 
ARs were predominantly mild or moderate in severity and most frequently included fatigue, 
chills, headache, myalgia, and pain at the injection site. Specifically, regardi ng fever, no 
participant reported fever of any severity following the first injection. Following the second 
injection, 2  participants in the 100 -µg dose group reported fever categorized as mild. All 
participants have been vaccinated, and safety and immunog enicity follow -up is ongoing. Indeed, 
immunogenicity data through 119 days after the first vaccination for 34  participants revealed 
binding and neutralizing GMTs that exceeded the median GMTs in a panel of convalescent sera 
from 41  controls. No SAEs were n oted, no study -halting rules were met, and no new related 
adverse events (AEs) were reported after Day  57 (Widge et al 2021 ). 
Additionally, an ongoing, placebo -controlled, dose -finding Phase 2a study (mRNA -1273 -P201; 
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ) conducted by the Sponsor under IND  19745 aims to evaluate the safety, 
reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of mRNA -1273 administered as 2  doses 28 days apart at 
dose levels of 50 and 100  µg. The study is being conducted in 60 0 healthy adults in 2 age 
cohorts: 18  to 54 years of age (300 participants) and at least 55  years of age (300  participants). 
All participants were randomly assigned in a ratio of 1:1:1 to receive either placebo or mRNA -
1273 at 1 of 2  doses, either 50 µg or  100 µg. The study was designed to begin with parallel 
enrollment of all 300 participants in Cohort 1 (≥ 18 to < 55 years old) and a sentinel group of 50 
participants in Cohort 2 (≥ 55 years old). An independent safety monitoring committee (SMC) 
reviewed a ll blinded and unblinded safety data through Day 57 (1 month after Dose 2) for both 
cohorts and found the vaccine tolerable, saw no safety concerns, and recommended continuing 
the study as planned. The study is now completely enrolled, and all dosing is co mplete; 
participants are undergoing additional serologic testing and safety follow -up. 
The 100 µg dose level is currently being investigated in a large Phase 3 efficacy study 
(mRNA -1273 -P301; [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ) in approximately 30, 000 adults 18  years of age and older, 
randomly assigned 1:1 to receive either vaccine or placebo. Recently published data show ed a 
vaccine efficacy (VE) of 94.1% against symptomatic COVID -19 illness with onset at least 14 
days after the second injection ( Baden et al 2021 ). Although moderate transient reactogenicity 
occurred more frequently in the mRNA -1273 group, SAEs were rare , and the incidence was 
similar between the 2 groups. On 18  Dec 2020, the Moderna  COVID -19 vaccine was a uthorized 
by the US FDA for emergency use in individuals ≥  18 years of age. The participants in this 
Phase 3 study are currently undergoing assessments for long -term safety and durability of VE. 
Finally, a Phase 2/3, randomized, observer -blind, placebo -controlled study (mRNA -1273 -P203) 
conducted by the Sponsor under IND 19745 is evaluating the safety, reactogenicity, and 
effectiveness of mRNA -1273 in healthy adolescents 12 to < 18 years of age. This study began 
enrolling in December 2020 and enrolled 3,740 participants randomly assigned 2:1 to receive

followed for 12 months after the last dose . 
A detailed review of the clinical experience with LNPs containing S M-102 (mRNA vaccines and 
placebo) is provided in the IB.  
1.2 Benefit/Risk Assessment  
1.2.1 Potential  Benefits From Participation  
The following benefits may accrue to participants:  
• The mRNA -1273 vaccine may be an effective vaccine against COVID -19 in the study 
population  as well as the rare but serious  complication of  MIS-C (Zambrano et al 2022 ). 
• Participants will have a baseline (Day  1) evaluation for SARS -CoV -2 infection and 
ongoing surveillance for COVID -19 throughout the study.  
• The study will contribute to the development of a vaccine against COVID -19 for children 
6 months to < 12 years of age.  
1.2.2 Risks From Study Participation and Their Mitigation  
Immediate systemic allergic reactions (eg, anaphylaxis) can occur following any vaccination. 
These reactions are very rare and are estimated to occur once per 450,000  vaccinations for 
vaccines that do not contain allergens such as gelatin or egg protein ( Zent et al 2002 ). As a 
precaution, all participants wil l remain under observation at the study site for at least 30  minutes 
after injection.  
Vasovagal syncope (fainting) can occur before or after any vaccination, is usually triggered by 
the pain or anxiety caused by the injection and is not related to the subs tance injected. Therefore, 
it is important that standard precautions and procedures are followed to avoid injury from 
fainting.  
Intramuscular injection with other mRNA vaccines manufactured by the Sponsor containing the 
SM-102 LNP commonly results in a tra nsient and self -limiting local inflammatory reaction. This 
typically includes pain, erythema (redness), or swelling (hardness) at the injection site, which are 
mostly mild to moderate in severity and usually occur within 24  hours of injection. In the large  
Phase 3 efficacy study of mRNA -1273 described above, delayed injection site reactions occurred 
with an incidence of approximately 1%. These reactions typically began 8  days or more 
following injection, were mostly not severe,  and were rarely observed afte r the second dose.  
The majority of local and systemic solicited ARs observed after injection with mRNA -1273 at 
the 100 -µg dose level have been mild to moderate in severity ( Section  1.1.3 ). The most 
ModernaTX, Inc.  
mRNA -1273 -P204 Protocol Amendment 9  mRNA -1273  
Confidential  Page 60 commonly reported systemic ARs were headache, myalgia, fatigue, chills, and fever. In the 
majority of cases, the reactions resolved spontaneously within several days.  
Laboratory abnormalities (including in creases in hepatic enzymes and serum lipase levels) 
following injection were observed in clinical studies with similar mRNA -based vaccines. These 
abnormalities were without clinical symptoms or signs and returned toward baseline (Day  1) 
values over time. T he clinical significance of these observations is unknown. Further details are 
provided in the current IB.  
There is a theoretical risk that active vaccination to prevent SARS -CoV -2 infection may cause a 
paradoxical increase in the risk of severe COVID -19. This possibility is based on the rare 
phenomenon of vaccine -associated ERD, which was first seen in the 1960s with 2  vaccines made 
in the same way (formalin -inactivated whole virus) and designed to protect children against 
infection with respiratory syncyt ial virus ( Chin et al 1969 ) or measles virus ( Fulginiti et al 1967 ). 
It is noteworthy that these vaccines were the result of a completely different formulation and 
with an entirely different mechanism of action than mRNA -based vaccines such as mRNA -1273. 
Disease enhancement has also been proposed as a possible explanation for cases of more serious 
disease associated with dengue vaccination ( Thomas and Yoon 2019 ; WHO 2019 ). There is no 
evidence to suggest  that mRNA -1273 causes enhanced disease even after widespre ad use  in the 
general population post -authorization.  Data from the ongoing Phase 3 study suggests no 
evidence of enhanced disease  either , as fewer cases of severe COVID -19 and COVID -19 were 
observed in participants who received mRNA -1273 than in those who received placebo.  
In order to address this theoretical risk, animal studies have been performed in young and aged 
wild-type mice and rhesus macaques (NHPs). These studies were designed to capture 
immunogenicity endpoints that would be predictive of ERD and  also to evaluate if, at protective 
or subprotective dose levels of mRNA -1273, evidence of disease enhancement would be 
observed after challenge of the animals with SARS -CoV -2. These nonclinical studies 
demonstrated that mRNA -1273 is safe and well tolerate d in different animal species; is 
immunogenic; drives a robust SARS -CoV -2-specific Ab, neutralization, and Th1 -directed CD4 
T-cell response; fully protects animals from challenge at dose levels as low as 1  μg/dose in mice 
and 30  μg/dose in NHPs; and does n ot lead to ERD at protective or subprotective dose levels 
(Corbett et al 2020a ; Corbett et al 2020b ). Clinical immunogenicity data from the DMID Phase  1 
study of mRNA -1273 demonstrated high le vels of nAbs and Th1 -polarized CD4 T -cell responses 
(Jackson et al 2020 ), consistent with the immunogenicity observed in the nonclinical studies. 
These data suggest that the risk of paradoxical ERD, while not eliminated, is li kely to be low.  
In the context of the EUA  of mRNA -1273 for individuals aged 18 years and older, there have 
been very rare reports of myocarditis and pericarditis occurring after vaccination with Moderna  
COVID -19 Vaccine. The majority of the cases have been  reported in young males shortly after 
ModernaTX, Inc.  
mRNA -1273 -P204 Protocol Amendment 9  mRNA -1273  
Confidential  Page 61 the second dose of the vaccine. These are typically mild cases and individuals tend to recover 
within a short time following standard treatment and rest ( Gargano et al, 2021 ). 
1.2.3 Overall Benefit/Risk Conclusion  
Based on the Phase 3 data and the results of the Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies described above, the 
Sponsor intends to study 3 dose levels (25, 50, and 100 µg) in the proposed Phase 2/3 study in 
participants 6 months to < 12 years of age  (and an optional booster of 1 0 or 25 µg) . Briefly, the 
proposed study is designed to dose escalate and age de -escalate through 3 sequential age groups 
(6 years to < 12 years, 2 years to < 6 years, and 6  months to < 2 years). Participants at each dose 
level will receive 2  doses at that  dose level approximately 28  days apart. The mRNA -1273  
primary series  dose levels that will be evaluated in each age group are given in Table  1.

Abbreviations: mRNA  = messenger RNA.  
1  For Part 3, the 25-µg dose will be evaluated as an alternative (lower dose) dosing regimen with a primary series 
(2 doses) followed by a third dose (1 dose)  
2  The 25-µg dose will be evaluated if 100 µg is eliminated at any point during the dose -escalation process to 
maintain dose ranging for this age group.  
The study will be conducted in 3 parts. Part 1 of the study will be open -label and consist of 
dose-escalation  and age de -escalation to select the dose for each age group. Part 2 of the study 
will be a placebo -controlled observer -blind evaluation of the selected dose in each age group.  
Part 3 of the study will be open -label and consist of an exploration of a lower  dose for any age 
group given as a 3-dose regimen (primary series followed by a third dose) . 
Immunogenicity data from participants who receive the mRNA -1273 vaccine at the selected dose 
level will be used to infer vaccine effectiveness. All participants will be followed up for 
12 months after receipt of the second injection  or 12 months after their booster  or third dose, if 
applicable, whichever is longer . 
Safety will be monitored throughout the study ( Section  7.5). 
Given that the preliminary data from Phase  1 to 3 studies have shown no significant safety 
concerns and robust immunogenicity, mRNA -1273  may be used to address the current 
COVID -19 outbr eak as a result of its uniquely rapid and scalable manufacturing process. In 
particular, a safe and effective vaccine against SARS -CoV -2 in children will help facilitate a 
return to school as an additional step towards normalization of daily activities.

3.1 General Design  
This is  a Phase 2/3, t hree-part, open -label, dose -escalation, age de -escalation and randomized, 
observer -blind, placebo -controlled expansion study intended to infer the effectiveness of 
mRNA -1273 in children aged 6 months to < 12 years. The study population will be divided into 
3 age groups ( 6 years to < 12 years, 2 years to < 6 years, and 6 months to < 2 years), and up to 
3 dose levels (25, 50, and 100 µg) of mRNA -1273 will be evaluated  (and a third dose or  an 
optional booster of 10 or 25 µg) . 
The study will be c onducted in 3 parts. Part 1 of the study will be open -label and consist of 
dose-escalation and age de -escalation in approximately 1,275 participants to select the dose for 
each age group with the highest number enrolled in the oldest age group ( Table  3). Part 2 of the 
study will be a placebo -controlled observer -blind evaluation of the selected dose in up to 
12,000  participants (up to 4,000 participants eac h in the 6 years to < 12 years, 2 years  to 
< 6 years, and the 6  months to < 2 years of age groups). Part 3 will be an open -label alternative 
dosing assessment  in approximately  300 participants in the 6 year to < 12 year old age group to 
assess reactogenicity and immunogenicity of a lower dose regimen . No participants in Part 1 will 
participate in Part 2  or Part 3  of the study , and no participant in Part 2 will participate in Part 3 of 
the study . 
In order to expedite the study of the safety of mR NA-1273 in school -aged children 6 years to 
< 12 years of age; Part 1 will enroll a total of approximately 375 participants per dose (both at 
the 50 and 100  µg dose levels) in this age group ( 6 years to < 12 years). The first 75 of these 
participants per do se will be included in the safety evaluation for dose -escalation and age 
de-escalation as well as the immunogenicity assessment needed for dose selection, as applicable. 
Additionally, approximately 300 participants per dose will be enrolled to assess for a ny AE 
occurring at 1% or higher. The sample size for Part 2 in this age group ( 6 years to < 12 years) 
will be adjusted to approximately 1700  participants. Conversely, approximately 75 participants 
in the middle age group (2  years to < 6 years) will be enro lled per dose in Part 1 for safety and 
dose selection and Part  2 will utilize the dose selected in Part 1 to inform on AEs occurring at a 
frequency of 1% or greater. In the youngest age group (6  months to < 2 years), approximately 
150 participants will be enrolled per dose in Part 1 for safety and dose selection and Part 2 will 
utilize the dose selected in Part 1 to inform on AEs occurring at a frequency of 1% or greater. 
For details, please refer to Section  7.5. 
The study will begin with the oldest age group ( 6 years to < 12 years) and age de -escalate as 
described under Study Progression. Each age group will begin with Part  1 and may advance to 
Part 2 and Part  3 independently. For details, please refer to the study schematic in Figure  1.

Part 1 of the study will be open -label. The study will begin with enrollment of approximately 
375 participants in the 6 years to < 12 years age group (Study Arm 1) and dosing with 50 µg of 
mRNA -1273. After at least 75  participants in Study Arm 1 have completed Day 8 (1 week after 
Dose 1 of mRNA -1273 50  µg), an internal safety team (IST) will review the available safety data 
and provide a recommendation whether to escalate the d ose to 100  µg in the 6 years to 
< 12 years age group (Study Arm 2; n = 375) and independently whether to begin dosing at the 
50-µg dose level in the 2 years to < 6 years age group (Study Arm 3; n = 75). After at least 
75 participants in Study Arm  1 reach D ay 36 (1 week after Dose 2 of mRNA -1273 50 µg), the 
IST will again review the available safety data and provide a recommendation whether to 
administer Dose 2 of mRNA -1273 100 µg in Study Arm 2 and whether to administer Dose 2 of 
mRNA -1273 50 µg in Study Arm 3. Simultaneously, the enrollment of the remaining 
300 planned participants for both Study Arm 1 and  Study Arm 2 will be ongoing. A preliminary 
safety and immunogenicity data review of Study Arm 1, and Study Arm 2 as applicable, will aid 
in the selecti on of a dose level for Part 2. Once all or a subset of participants from each of Study 
Arms 1 and 2 reach Day 57 (1 month after Dose 2 of mRNA -1273), an interim analysis may be 
conducted to review the safety and immunogenicity data. Cumulative safety data for 
approximately 300  participants at the selected dose level will be reviewed by the Data Safety 
Monitoring Board (DSMB) before enrollment in Part 2, and the DSMB safety review 
recommendation will enable the expansion of the 6 years to < 12 years age grou p (Part 2) to 
receive either mRNA -1273 at the selected dose level (Study Arm  8; n = 3,000) or placebo (Study 
Arm 9; n  = 1,000). The primary analysis of immunogenicity in Part  2 for Study Arm 8 
(mRNA -1273 recipients) will be conducted after the pre -specifie d Immunogenicity Subset of 
participants reaches Day 57, and safety analysis will be conducted after a subset or all 
participants in Study Arms 8 and 9 reach Day 57.  
Part 3 of the study will be open -label. A total of approximately  300 participants in the 6 year to 
< 12 year old age group will be enrolled to receive 3 total doses of mRNA -1273 at 25 µg, given 
as the primary series doses at Day 1 and Day 29 followed by a third dose on Day  149/booster 
dose ( BD)-Day 1 (at least 3 months and up to 5 months after the second dose in the primary 
series). The primary analysis of immunogenicity and safety in Part 3 for Study Arm 14 will be 
conducted after all treated part icipants reach Day 57 (for primary series) . The primary  analysis of 
immunogenicity and safety  for the third dose will be conducted after all participants who 
received a third dose reach Day  177/BD-Day 29.  
For the middle age group ( 2 years to < 6 years), progression in Part 1 will be as follows: After 
75 participants in Study Arm 3 have completed D ay 8 (1 week after Dose  1 of mRNA -1273 
50 µg), an IST will review the available safety data and provide a recommendation whether to 
ModernaTX, Inc.  
mRNA -1273 -P204 Protocol Amendment 9  mRNA -1273  
Confidential  Page 72 escalate the dose to 100 µg in the 2 years to < 6 years age group (Study Arm 4; n = 75) and 
whether to begin dosing in the 6  months to < 2 years age group at the 25 -µg dose level (Study 
Arm 5; n = 150). After the 75  participants in Study Arm 3 reach Day 36 (1 week after Dose 2 of 
mRNA -1273 50  µg), the IST will review the available safety data and provide a recommendation 
whether to administer Dose 2 of mRNA -1273 100  µg in Study Arm 4 and whether to administer 
Dose 2 of mRNA -1273 25  µg in Study Arm 5. An optional Arm 7 may be enrolled in this ag e 
group (approximately 75  participants) at the 25 -µg dose if the 100-µg dose is eliminated at any 
point during dose -escalation process, to maintain dose ranging for this age group. A preliminary 
safety and immunogenicity data review of all applicable arms will aid in the selection of a dose 
level for Part 2. Once all or a subset of participants in all applicable arms reach Day  57 (1  month 
after Dose 2 of mRNA -1273), an interim analysis may be conducted to review safety and 
immunogenicity data. A preliminary  safety and immunogenicity data review of all applicable 
Arms will aid in the selection of a dose level for Part  2 and for  expansion of the 2 years to 
< 6 years age group (Part 2) to receive either mRNA -1273 at the selected dose level (Study Arm 
10; n = up  to 3,000) or placebo (Study Arm 11; n = up to 1,000). The primary analysis of 
immunogenicity in Part 2 for Study Arm  10 (mRNA -1273 recipients) will be conducted after a 
pre-specified Immunogenicity Subset of participants reaches Day 57, and safety analysi s will be 
conducted after a subset or all participants in Study Arms 10 and 11 reach Day  57. 
For the youngest age group (6 months to < 2 years) progression in Part 1 will be as follows: In 
Study Arm 5, after 150 participants have completed Day 8 (1 week af ter Dose 1 of mRNA -1273 
25 µg), an IST will review the available safety data and provide a recommendation whether to 
escalate the dose to 50 µg (Study Arm 6; n = 150). After the 150  participants in Study Arm 5 
reach Day  36 (1 week after Dose 2 of mRNA -1273  25 µg), the IST will review the available 
safety data and provide a recommendation whether to administer Dose 2 of mRNA -1273 50 µg 
in Study Arm  6. Once all or a subset of participants in Study Arms 5 and 6 reach Day 57 
(1 month after Dose  2 of mRNA -1273),  an interim analysis may be conducted to review the 
tolerability and immunogenicity data at each dose level. A preliminary safety and 
immunogenicity data review of Study Arm 5  and Study Arm 6 , as applicable, will aid in the 
selection of a dose level for Pa rt 2 and allow for expansion of the 6 months to < 2 years age 
group (Part 2) to receive either mRNA -1273 at the selected dose level (Study Arm  12; n  = up to 
3,000) or placebo (Study Arm 13; n  = up to 1,000). T he primary analysis of immunogenicity in 
Part 2  for Study Arm 12 (mRNA -1273 recipients) will be conducted after the pre -specified 
Immunogenicity Subset of participants reaches Day 57, and safety analysis will be conducted 
after a subset or all participants in Study Arms 12 and 13 reach Day 57 . 
In gener al, if a decision is made not to proceed with administration of the higher dose and/or the 
second injection at a given dose level (eg, due to safety concerns), the participants scheduled to 
receive the higher dose may receive a lower dose, and the particip ants who had received the 
ModernaTX, Inc.  
mRNA -1273 -P204 Protocol Amendment 9  mRNA -1273  
Confidential  Page 73 higher dose level as their first injection will likely be given the next lower dose level that was 
tolerated for their second injection. The dose level not tolerated in the older age group will not be 
administered in any of the yo unger age groups. Within an age group, if one of the dose levels is 
found to have an unacceptable tolerability profile, the age group may progress to Part 2 at a 
lower dose level.  
Part 1 and Part 2 participants who have not yet received a booster dose with  mRNA -1273, nor a 
non-study vaccine booster dose will be offered an optional booster dose lower than the chosen 
primary series for each age group (Table 4), at least 3 months after Dose 2 of mRNA -1273.  
The final analysis will be performed when participants (Study Arms 1 to 1 4) conclude the safety 
follow -up at 12 months  after their last dose (ei ther Dose 2 or booster dose) . 
The goal of the study is to support an indication for use of mRNA -1273 50 or 100  µg IM, given 
as 2 injections, approximately 28 days apart (pandemic dosing) or for the use of mRNA -1273 
25 µg given as 3 injections, approximatel y 28 days (primary series) and at least 3  months  and up 
to 5 months  (third dose) apart ( lower  dosing) in the 6 years to < 12 years age group; mRNA -
1273 25, 50, or 100 µg IM, given as 2  injections, approximately 28 days apart in the 2 years to 
< 6 years age  group; and mRNA -1273 25 or 50  µg IM, given as 2  injections, approximately 
28 days apart in the 6  months to < 2 years age group. In addition, the study will provide support 
for the indication  of a booster dose, given at the lower  dosage level of the primar y series,  at least 
6 months , (as applicable) , after Dose 2. The basis for demonstrating vaccine effectiveness is 
proposed to be met by measuring serum antibody responses in the study participants. The 
approach to inferring vaccine effectiveness will depend  on whether an accepted serum antibody 
threshold conferring protection against COVID -19 has been established. If an antibody threshold 
of protection has been established, effectiveness will be inferred based on the proportion of study 
participants with ser um antibody levels (on Day 57) that meet or exceed the antibody threshold. 
If an antibody threshold of protection has not been established, effectiveness will be inferred by 
demonstrating noninferiority for each age group ( 6 years to < 12 years, 2 years to < 6 years, and 
6 months to < 2 years in Study  P204) compared with young adult (18 to 25 years of age) 
participants enrolled in the ongoing clinical endpoint efficacy trial (Study  P301) by both 
geometric mean (GM ) values and seroresponse rate ( SRR ). The st atistical parameters to infer 
effectiveness are described in Section  2. 
This study in children 6 months to < 12 years of age will monitor all parti cipants for a total of 
12 months following the second dose of vaccine or placebo , or 12 months following their booster  
or third  dose, if applicable . If a COVID -19 vaccine is authorized or licensed for a specific age 
group before the end of the study, pleas e refer to Section 3.3 for unblinding and/or cross -over 
plans. Safety assessments will include solicited ARs 7 days after each injection (ie, the day of 
injection and 6 subsequent days), unsolicited A Es (28 days aft er each injection), and medically 
ModernaTX, Inc.  
mRNA -1273 -P204 Protocol Amendment 9  mRNA -1273  
Confidential  Page 74 attended adverse events (MAAEs), SAEs, and adverse events of special interest (AESIs) 
(including MIS -C and myocarditis and/or pericarditis) through the entire study period.  
Blood samples will be collected from participants  in Part 1 , Part 2 , and Part 3  of the study for 
assessment of immunogenicity as specified in Section 3.1.1.2 . If a Day 1 (baseline) blood sample 
cannot be obtained in either Part 1 , Part 2 , or Part 3 , the participant will be considered either a 
screen failure due to inability to satisfy inclusion criteri on 3 or could be rescheduled for 
rescreening . Participants  may be  rescreened 1 time, either within the same screening period for 
Part 1 or Part  2 or in a new screening period of Part 2  or Part 3  if the initial screening was in Part 
1 or Part  2, respectively . If the participant is rescreened and a blood sample still cannot be 
obtained, the n he/she will be considered a screen failure due to inability to satisfy inclusion 
criterion  3. Blood samples will also be tested for the development of antibodies directed against 
nonvaccine antigen (eg, antibodies against the nucleocapsid protein), which  will signify infection 
with SARS -CoV -2. The incidence of SARS -CoV -2 infection among vaccine recipients and 
placebo recipients will be compared to assess the potential for mRNA -1273 to reduce the rate of 
infection in vaccine recipients. In addition, all pa rticipants will be monitored for symptoms of 
COVID -19 and scheduled for illness visits if concerning symptoms occur, and a nasal swab will 
be collected at the illness visit  while Part 2 of the trial is still blinded for an y age group . Once the 
trial is unb linded for all age groups and thus no placebo comparator group is available going 
forward, illness visits for COVID -19 symptoms or exposures and convalescent visits will no 
longer be required.  
3.1.1 Study Periods  
This study involves up to 8  scheduled visits including up to 6 in -person visits (if screening and 
baseline are done separately) and 2 telemedicine visits (Visit 2 and Visit 4; remote visit by means 
of telecommunication technology). An additional in clinic visit (Visit 4S) will be conducted for a 
coho rt of participants from selected Vaccine and Treatment Evaluation Units (VTEU) sites on 
Day 43 (2 weeks after Dose 2 of mRNA -1273 or placebo) for exploratory serology and 
cell-mediated immunity (CMI; S  protein -specific T -cell responses) in Part 2 of the st udy. 
If participants in Parts 1 and 2 decide to receive a booster  dose, the booster  study visit schedule  
(Table 15) and blood draw schedule  (Table  16) will be utilized . 
The study duration for each pa rticipant will vary depending on whether they choose to receive a 
booster or not;  without a booster dose, it will be approximately 14 months, which includes 
1 month for screening (Day  ˗28 to Day  -1), 1 month for dosing (on Day  1 and Day  29), and 
12 months of follow -up after the second dose to monitor for safety, tolerability, reactogenicity, 
immunogenicity, and efficacy.  With a booster given , the study duration will be up to 24 months.  
ModernaTX, Inc.  
mRNA -1273 -P204 Protocol Amendment 9  mRNA -1273  
Confidential  Page 75 For Study Arm 14, the study duration will be up to 1 7 months, which include s 1 month for 
screening (Day -28 to Day -1), at least 5 months for dosing (on Day 1, Day 29, and a third on 
Day 149/BD-Day 1), and 12 months for follow -up after the third dose of investigational 
product  (IP). 
All scheduled study visit s should be completed within the respective visit windows. If the 
participant is not able to attend a study site visit as a result of the COVID -19 pandemic 
(self-quarantine or disruption of study site activities following business continuity plans and/or 
local government mandates for “stay at home” or “shelter in place”), a telemedicine visit should 
be conducted in place of the study site visit. The telemedicine visit should encompass all 
scheduled visit assessments that can be completed remotely, such as a ssessment for A Es and 
concomitant medications (eg, as defined in scheduled safety telephone calls). Home visits will be 
permitted for all nondosing visits, with the exception of screening, if a participant cannot visit 
the study site as a result of the COV ID-19 pandemic. Home visits must be permitted by the study 
site institutional review board (IRB) and the participant’s parent(s)/ legally authorized  
representatives ( LAR[s]) via informed consent and have prior approval from the Sponsor (or its 
designee).  
This study will be conducted in compliance with the protocol, Good Clinical Practice ( GCP), and 
all applicable regulatory requirements ( Section  10.2.1 ). 
3.1.1.1  Screening Period  
After providing informed consent/assent, participants will undergo screening assessments to 
determine study eligibility. Screening assessments ( Table  12 and Table 17) must be completed 
after the participant’s parent (s)/LAR(s) signs the informed consent form (ICF) and the 
participant, where applicable, signs the assent form. The investigator will review study entry 
criteria to determine participant eligibility during the screening period.  
Screening Visit and Day 1 may  be combined on the same day. Additionally, the Screening Visit 
may be performed over multiple visits if performed within the 28 -day screening window 
(Table  12 and Table 17). 
Eligible participants will enter the Treatment Period.  
3.1.1.2  Treatment and Follow -up Period  
On Day  1, after the completion of the scheduled assessments ( Table  12 and Table 17), 
participants will be administered a single IM dose of the IP mRNA -1273 (25, 50, or 100  µg) or 
placebo. Placebo will be administered only to those participating in Part 2 of the study. The 
procedure s for IP administration will be detailed in the mRNA -1273 -P204 Pharmacy Manual. 
Participants will be closely monitored for safety and will remain at the study site for observation 
ModernaTX, Inc.  
mRNA -1273 -P204 Protocol Amendment 9  mRNA -1273  
Confidential  Page 76 for at least 30  minutes after dosing. On Day  29, the second dose of IP will be administered. If the 
visit for the second dose (Day 29) is disrupted and cannot be completed at Day 29 (+7 days) as a 
result of the COVID -19 pandemic (self -quarantine or disruption of study site activities following 
business continuity plans and/or loca l government mandates for “stay at home” or “shelter in 
place”), the visit window may be extended to Day 29 + 21 days. When the extended visit 
window is used, the remaining study visits should be rescheduled to follow the intervisit  interval 
from the actual date of the second dose. Participants will be monitored for 12  months after the 
second dose of IP  (or booster)  or 12 months after their third dose (Part 3)  of IP, if applicable and 
whichever is longer  for safety , immunogenicity assessments , and biom arker samples . 
To test for the presence of SARS -CoV -2 by RT -PCR, nasal swab samples will be collected 
before the injections on Day  1, Day  29, Day 43 (if applicable  per SoA ), Day  57, Day 209, and 
Day 394. For Part 3, participants will have a nasal swab samp le collected before the injections on 
Day 1, Day 29, Day 57, Day 149/BD -Day 1, Day  177/BD -Day 29, Day  329/BD -Day 181, and 
Day 514/BD -Day 366, according to the schedule of assessments (SoA ; Table  12 and Table 17). 
Participants who test positive at baseline may receive Dose 2 as long as they remain 
asymptomatic at the time of dosing.  
During the course of the study  while any age group remains blinded , participants who meet pre -
specified disease criteria that suggest possible SARS -CoV -2 infection will be asked to contact 
the study site to arrange for a prompt, thorough, and careful assessment, including a nasal swab 
sample to be tested for the presence o f SARS -CoV -2 by RT -PCR. Confirmed, symptomatic 
cases of SARS -CoV -2 infection will be captured as MAAEs and , if severe, reported in an 
expedited time frame to the Sponsor ( Section  7.4.4 ). Once the study is unblinded for every age 
group and COVID -19 surveillance is discontinued, only COVID -19 events for which the 
participants sees a health care provider will be reported (as per standard AE reporting).  
All participants will be monitored for safety and reactogenicity. All participants in Part  1 of the 
study will provide blood specimens for immunogenicity on Day  1 (prior to the first dose) and 
will also provide additional samples after the second dose of m RNA -1273 at Day  57, Day  209, 
and Day  394, except for the expansion of Arms 1 and 2 (N=  ~300  participants per arm) who 
have a scheduled Day 1 blood draw and a voluntary blood draw on Day 57 only. Participants in 
each age group in Part  2 will be assigned to 1 of 5 phlebotomy cohorts. Participants in 3 of these 
5 cohorts will provide blood specimens for immunogenicity at the following time points: Day  1 
(prior to randomization and before the first dose), Day 57, and one of Day 29 (prior to the second 
dose), Da y 209, or Day  394 (such that each participant provides a total of 3 blood samples only). 
Participants in the Cohort D  (remainder of the age group) will provide a blood sample at Day  1 
(prior to randomization and before the first dose) and within 4 days of receiving Dose 2 at 
Day 30 (+3 days ) for storage and potential future biomarker testing. For participants already

Confidential  Page 77 enrolled in Cohort D prior to  Protocol Amendment 4, this blood draw will be optional and 
confirmed at time of re -consenting; for all participa nts newly enrolled into Cohort D under 
Amendment 4, it will be mandatory.  
A fifth cohort of participants (selected VTEU sites only) will provide blood samples for 
assessment of exploratory serology and CMI (S  protein -specific T -cell responses) on Day  1 
(prior to randomization and before the first dose), Day 43, Day  209, and Day  394. Table 14 
provides the blood sampling schedule for Part 2 of the study.  
Optional Booster Doses:  
All participants in Part 1 and Part 2 who choose to receive a booster dose will provide blood 
specimens for immunogenicity  and serostatus on BD -Day 1 (prior to booster dose). Subgroups of 
participants  who receive a booster dose wil l also provide one more blood specimen post -booster  
(see Table  16 for details).  
All participants in Part 3 of the study will provide blood specimens for immunogenicity on Day  1 
(prior to the first dose) and will also provide additional samples at Day 57, Day 149/BD-Day 1 
(prior to third dose), and one month after the third dose on Day 177/BD-Day 29 . The first  
150 participants ( Sub-Cohort F) will also have a blood draw on  Day 329/BD-Day 18 1; the 
second 150 participants  (Sub-Cohort G) will also have a blood draw on Day 514/BD -Day 366. 
Participants and their parent(s)/LAR(s) will be instructed on the day of the first dose (Day 1) and 
reminded on the day o f the second dose (Day  29) and day of booster /third  dose (BD -Day 1) how 
to document and report solicited local or systemic ARs in a provided electronic diary (eDiary). 
Solicited ARs, unsolicited A Es, MAAEs, A Es leading to withdrawal, AESIs, and SAEs will be 
assessed as described in Section  7.1, according to the time points in in the SoAs ( Section  10.1). 
An unscheduled visit may be prompted by reactogenicity issues, or new or ongoing AEs, and 
while Part 2 of the trial is still blinded for any age group, illness visit criteria for COVID -19. 
Illness visit criteria for COVID -19 will be applicable while Part 2 of the trial is still blinded.  
While Part 2 is still blinded for any age group, if  a participant meets the pre -specified criteria of 
suspicion for COVID -19, th e participant will be asked to return within 72 hours or as soon as 
possible to the study site for an unscheduled illness visit, to include a nasal swab sample (for RT -
PCR testing to evaluate for the presence of SARS -CoV -2 infection) and other clinical 
evaluations. If a study site visit is not possible, a home visit may be arranged to collect the nasal 
swab sample and conduct clinical evaluations. The study site may collect an additional nasal 
swab sample for SARS -CoV -2 testing to be able to render appropri ate medical care for the study 
participant as determined by local standards of care. Additionally, clinical information will be 
carefully collected to evaluate the severity of the clinical case.  
ModernaTX, Inc.  
mRNA -1273 -P204 Protocol Amendment 9  mRNA -1273  
Confidential  Page 78 While Part 2 of the study is still blinded for any age group,  a convalescent visit may be 
scheduled approximately 28 days (+7 days) after diagnosis of COVID -19 if there are doubts 
about the initial diagnosis (at the discretion of the investigator) . At this visit, a blood sample for 
potential immunologic assessment o f SARS -CoV -2 infection will be collected.  
Once the trial is unblinded for all age groups and thus no placebo comparator group is available 
going forward, illness visits for COVID -19 symptoms or exposures and convalescent visits will 
no longer be required.  
For treatment and follow -up assessments of placebo participants in the case that a COVID -19 
vaccine is authorized or licensed for a specific age group during conduct of the trial, please refer 
to Section 3.3. 
3.2 Scientific Rationale for Study Design  
This Phase 2/3 study in children 6 months to < 12 years of age is planned to understand the 
tolerability and immunogenicity of mRNA -1273 in a pediatric population. This study follows a 
pivotal Phase 3 study (Study P301) in 30,000 adults 18 years and older to demonstrate the 
tolerability, safety, and high efficacy of mRNA -1273 (100 µg on Days 1 and 29) against 
COVID -19. This pediatric study is intended to confirm safety in children between 6 months and 
12 years of age and bridge immunogenicity between children and young adults (18 to 25  years of 
age) enrolled in the pivotal adult Phase 3 study (Study P301). It is necessary to demonstrate 
noninferiority of t he induced immune response in children compared with that in adults to infer 
vaccine effectiveness in this age group.  
Part 1 of the study is designed to dose escalate and age de -escalate through 3 age groups ( 6 years 
to < 12 years, 2 years to < 6 years, and 6 months to < 2 years). Each age group will begin dosing 
with the lowest dose planned for that group. Dose -escalation and age de -escalation will progress 
only after confirming the safety of a dose level in each age group after each IP injection. The 
placebo-controlled dose -expansion Part 2 of the study will begin only after an interim analysis is 
performed for safety and immunogenicity in each of the age groups at the selected dose level.  
With SARS -CoV -2 expected to be circulating in the general populatio n during the study, a 
pre-defined subset of participants will provide blood samples for antibody analysis starting on 
Day 29 and continuing through 12 months after the last dose of IP. In addition, participants will 
have nasal swab samples collected  at dif ferent points throughout the study, as outlined in the 
SoA ( Table  12 and Table 17). Furthermore, a nasal swab sample and a blood sample will be 
taken to confirm the diagnosis of SARS -CoV -2 via RT -PCR and serology, respectively, if there 
are any signs or symptoms or an MAAE suggesting SARS -CoV -2 infection in a participant. 
Additionally, clinical information will be carefully collected to evaluate the severi ty of the 
clinical case.  
ModernaTX, Inc.  
mRNA -1273 -P204 Protocol Amendment 9  mRNA -1273  
Confidential  Page 79 As it is possible that participants are naturally exposed to SARS -CoV -2 through community 
exposure, the nasal swab samples collected before study injection and the serologic assays for 
antibody responses to nonvaccine antigen(s) ma y help discriminate between natural infection and 
vaccine -induced antibody responses, should such discrimination be needed.  
An optional booster dose  will be offered  to participants in Part 1 and Part 2 of the study. While 
this study is primarily designed to assess a 2-dose primary series of mRNA -1273 in children 
6 months to < 12 years, the emergence of the recent SARS -CoV -2 variant of concern ‘Omicron’ 
has shown in adul ts that protection from infection after 2 doses is less than after booster doses, 
although 2 doses still protect well against severe disease, hospitalization, and death  (Johnson et 
al 2021 ). In Part B of Study mRNA -1273 -P201 i n which participants who had received 2 doses 
of 50 µg or 100 µg of mRNA -1273 6 -8 months prior were administered a 50  µg booster of 
mRNA -1273, participants demonstrated enhanced immune responses compared with pre-boost 
levels and met the noninferiority cri teria stipulated in the FDA Guidance on EUA for Vaccines 
to Prevent COVID -19. In addition, interim results from Study mRNA -1273 -P205 show that a 
50 µg booster of mRNA -1273 increased neutralizing antibody levels against Omicron 
approximately 37 -fold compare d with pre-boost levels.  
3.3 Justification for Dose, Control Product, and Choice of Study Population  
Based on the Phase 3 data and the results of the Phase 1 and 2 studies described in Section  1.1.3 , 
the Sponsor intends to study 3 dose levels (25, 50, and 100 µg) in the Phase 2/3 study in children 
6 months to < 12 years of age. On 18  Dec 2020, the mRNA -1273 vaccine (100 µg dose) was 
autho rized by the US FDA for emergency use in individuals ≥ 18 years of age.  
As there are no licensed SARS -CoV -2 vaccines available for children 6 months to 1 2 years of 
age at time of enrollment  in each age group , 0.9% sodium chloride will be used as a placebo 
control for the safety and immunogenicity assessments . The mRNA -1273 vaccine and  placebo 
injections will look different, so administration will be blinded in Part 2  (Section  8.1). 
If a COVID -19 vaccine (mRNA -1273 or other) is authorized or licensed, eligible study 
participants (by virtue of their age) will be offered the opportunity to unblind via a phone call 
and learn what treatment they received, ideally after they have reached at least study Day  57. 
Participants who learn that they have received mRNA -1273 will continue in the study and will 
be followed per protocol . If a participant previously received placebo the participant will be 
offered cross -over vaccination with mRNA -1273 (first injection), followed by a 
second  mRNA -1273 injection 28  days thereafter . The remainder of study visits will subsequently 
be performed as shown in the SoA for cross -over vaccination with mRNA -1273 if any COVID -
19 vaccine is authorized or licensed  for participant’s age group (Table  13). All participants will 
continue to be followed until their end -of-study visit. In addition, participants who received a 
ModernaTX, Inc.  
mRNA -1273 -P204 Protocol Amendment 9  mRNA -1273  
Confidential  Page 80 lower dose in Part  1 than was ultimately approved for their respective  age group in Part  2, will be 
eligible for a booster dose with the optimal dose once authorization or approval of mRNA -1273 
has been granted for their age group.  If a decision is made to go outside the protocol to receive 
an EUA vaccine  for the primary ser ies, the partic ipant will be discontinued  from the study . 
In case of EUA being granted for mRNA -1273, the participants will have 4 months from date of 
EUA to elect to cross -over to mRNA -1273 within the study. Four months after the EUA date, 
cross -over will  only be allowed under special circumstances (such as intermittent COVID -19 that 
would mandate a 90 -day waiting period) and will  need to be discussed with the Sponsor on a 
case-by-case basis.  
In case of an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) being granted fo r children <5 years in the 
US, Canadian participants in the relevant age group will also qualify for unblinding and cross -
over vaccination if they wish to as of the same date, even if Health Canada has not authorized 
another COVID -19 vaccine yet in Canada . 
Participants under 6 years of age in Part 2 who have reached at least 6 months follow  up after 
Dose 2 will be eligible for unblinding via a telephone call to learn which  treatment they received . 
Participants  who received p lacebo will be offered the option  of cross -over vaccination with 
mRNA -1273 at that point as described above.  
Participants who initially  received mRNA -1273  as their primary series  will be offered a booster 
dose with mRNA -1273.214  at least  3 months after Dose 2 , and those who received placebo and 
received cross -over vaccination for the primary series with mRNA -1273  will also be offered a 
booster  with mRNA -1273.214  at least 3 months after cross -over Dose 2. The dosage level for 
booster doses will be lower than the chosen primary series for each age group, since the experience 
with adult boosters shows that a lower dose will allow for reductions in reactogenicity  profile and 
dose sparing while still inducing a  high level of neutralizing antibodies. Booster dose levels per 
age group can be found in  Table 4. 
In order to allow for more comprehensive dose ranging , an additional open -label part, Part  3, is 
added per request by the health authorities . Part 3 will explore a lower dose given as a primary 
series followed by a planned third dose of the same dosage level as the primary series  after at 
least 3 month s and up to 5 months .

(normal saline), as detailed in the mRNA -1273 -P204 Pharmacy Manual.  
5.3.2 Administration of Study Vaccine  
In Part 1 and Part 2, each participant will receive 2 doses of IP by IM injection approximately 
28 days apart (Day  1 and Day  29). Part 1 and Part 2 participants who did not previously receive 
any booster doses will be offered a booster dose of IP by IM injection at least 3 months after 
Dose 2.  
For Part  3, each participant will receive 3 doses of IP by IM injections approximately 28 days 
apart for the 2 primary doses of the primary series followed by a third dose at least 3 months  and 
up to 5 months  after receipt of the second dose of the primary series (Day 1, Day 29, and 
Day 149/BD -Day 1). The IM injections will be administered into the deltoid muscle or 
anterolateral thigh (per investigator’s discretion), according to their assigned regimen and 
according to the procedures specified in the mRNA -1273 -P204 Pha rmacy Manual.  
At each visit when IP is administered, participants will be monitored for a minimum of 
30 minutes after administration. Assessments will include body temperature measurements (oral 
preferred for participants > 4 years of age, tympanic preferr ed for participants ≤ 4 years of age, 
but other methods acceptable in context of COVID -19 precautions) and monitoring for local or 
systemic reactions . 
Eligibility for the subsequent dose of IP will be determined by following the criteria outlined in 
Sectio n 6. 
The study sites will be appropriately staffed with individuals with basic cardiopulmonary 
resuscitation training/certification. Either on -site resuscitation equipment and personnel or 
appropr iate protocols for the rapid transport of participants to a resuscitation area or facility are 
required.  
5.3.3 Study Vaccine Delivery and Receipt

Further description of the IP and instructions for the receipt, storage, preparation, administration, 
accountability, and destruction of the IP are described in the mRNA -1273 -P204 Pharmacy 
Manual.  
5.3.4 Study V accine Packaging and Labeling  
The Sponsor will provide the investigator (via the study site pharmacy) with adequate quantities 
of IP. The sterile IP is packaged in 10R glass vials with a 6.3 -mL or an 8.0-mL fill volume. The 
IP will have all required labeli ng per regulations and will be supplied to the pharmacy in an 
unblinded manner.  
The IP will be packaged and labeled in accordance with the standard operating procedures of the 
Sponsor or its designee, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Title 21, Good Manufa cturing 
Practice guidelines, International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) GCP guidelines, guidelines 
for Quality System Regulations, and applicable regulations.  
5.3.5 Study Vaccine Storage  
The IP must be stored at -15°C to -25°C in a secure area with limited ac cess and be protected 
from moisture and light until it is prepared for administration ( Section  5.3.1 ). The freezer should 
have automated temperature recording and a 24 -hour alert system in place that allows for rapid 
response in case of freezer malfunction. There must be an available backup freezer. The freezer 
must be connected to a back -up generator, or an alternate plan must be in place in the event of a 
power failure. In addition, IP accountability study staff are required to keep a temperature log to 
establish a record of compliance with these storage conditions. The study site is responsible for 
reporting any IP that was not temperatur e controlled during shipment or during storage. Such IP 
will be retained for inspection by the monitor and disposed of according to approved methods.  
5.3.6 Study Vaccine Accountability  
It is the investigator’s responsibility that the IP accountability study staf f maintain accurate 
records in an IP accountability log of receipt of all IP, study site IP inventory, IP dispensing, IP 
injections, and return to the Sponsor or alternative disposition of used and unused IP vials.  
A study site monitor will review the inve ntory and accountability log during study site visits and 
at the completion of each part of the study. Additional details are found in the mRNA -1273 -P204 
Pharmacy Manual.  
ModernaTX, Inc.  
mRNA -1273 -P204 Protocol Amendment 9  mRNA -1273  
Confidential  Page 88 5.3.7 Study Vaccine Handling and Disposal  
A study site monitor will reconcile the IP invent ory during the conduct and at the end of each 
part of the study for compliance. Once fully reconciled after each monitoring visit at the study 
site, and completion of each age cohort or at the end of the study, the IP can be destroyed at the 
investigationa l site or by a Sponsor -selected third party, as appropriate.  
Vaccine may be destroyed at the study site only if permitted by local regulations and authorized 
by the Sponsor. A certificate of destruction must be completed and sent to the Sponsor or 
designee . 
5.4 Study Treatment Compliance  
All doses of IP will be administered at the study site under direct observation of medically 
qualified study staff and appropriately recorded (date and time) in the eCRF. Qualified study site 
staff will confirm that the partici pant has received the entire dose of IP. If a participant does not 
receive IP or does not receive all of the planned doses, the reason for the missed dose will be 
recorded. Data will be reconciled with study site accountability records to assess compliance . 
Participants who miss the second dose due to noncompliance with the visit schedule and not due 
to a safety pause will still be required to follow the original visit and testing schedule as 
described in the protocol and their regimen schedule. Unless cons ent/assent is withdrawn, a 
participant who withdraws or is withheld from receiving the second dose will remain in the study 
and complete all safety and immunogenicity assessments required through the participant’s last 
scheduled study visit.  
The study site  staff are responsible for ensuring that participants comply with the allowed study 
visit windows. If a participant misses a visit, every effort should be made to contact the 
participant and complete a visit within the defined visit window. If a participan t does not 
complete a visit within the time window, that visit will be classified as a missed visit and the 
participant will continue with subsequent scheduled study visits. All safety requirements of the 
missed visit will be captured and included in the s ubsequent visit.  
5.5 Prior and Concomitant Medications  
5.5.1 Prior Medications and Therapies  
Information about prior medications (including any prescription or over -the-counter medications, 
vaccines, or blood products) taken by the participant within the 28  days bef ore his/her 
parent(s)/LAR(s) provided informed consent and the participant provided assent (or as 
designated in the inclusion/exclusion requirements) will be recorded in the participant’s eCRF.  
 
ModernaTX, Inc.  
mRNA -1273 -P204 Protocol Amendment 9  mRNA -1273  
Confidential  Page 89 5.5.2 Concomitant Medications and Therapies  
At each study visit, st udy site staff must question the participant and/or the participant’s 
parent(s)/LAR(s) regarding any medications taken and vaccinations received by the participant 
and record the following information in the eCRF:  
• All nonstudy vaccinations administered wit hin the period starting 14 days before the first 
dose of IP and through 14 days after the last dose of IP.  
• Seasonal influenza vaccine administered for the current influenza season (typically 
October through April in the Northern Hemisphere).  
• All concomitan t medications taken through 28 days after each dose of IP. Antipyretics 
and analgesics taken prophylactically (ie, taken in the absence of any symptoms in 
anticipation of an injection reaction) will be recorded as such.  
• Any concomitant medications used to prevent or treat COVID -19 or its symptoms.  
− Note: if any participant who has received at least one dose of mRNA -1273  received 
another COVID -19 vaccine outside of the trial (eg, as a booster dose ), please record 
this under concomitant medications; the partic ipant may remain in the trial and will 
continue to be followed per protocol.  
• Any concomitant medications relevant to or for the treatment of an SAE or an MAAE.  
Participants will be asked in the eDiary if they have taken any antipyretic or analgesic to trea t or 
prevent fever or pain within 7 days after each IP dose, including on the day of dosing. Reported 
antipyretic or analgesic medications should be recorded in the source document by the study site 
staff during the post -injection period of the study visits or via other participant interactions 
(eg, telephone calls).  
Data regarding nutritional supplements, eg, vitamins, probiotics, and herbal supplements, will 
not be collected.  
Concomitant medications (including vaccinations) will be coded using the WH O Drug 
Dictionary. If a participant takes a prohibited drug therapy, the investigator and the contract 
research organization’s (CRO’s) medical monitor will make a joint decision about continuing or 
withholding further injection of the participant based on the time the medication was 
administered, the drug’s pharmacology and pharmacokinetics, and whether use of the medication 
will compromise the participant’s safety or interpretation of the data. It is the investigator’s 
responsibility to ensure that details  regarding concomitant medications are adequately recorded 
in the eCRF.

mRNA -1273 -P204 Protocol Amendment 9  mRNA -1273  
Confidential  Page 90 5.5.3 Conco mitant Medications and Vaccines That May Lead to the  Elimination of a 
Participant from Per Protocol Analyses 
The use of the following concomitant medications and/or vaccines will not require withdrawal of 
the participant from the study but may determine a participant’s eligibility to receive a second 
dose or be included in the per  protocol (PP) analysis (analysis sets are described in Section  8.4): 
• Any investigational or nonregistered product (drug or vaccine) other than the IP used 
during the study period.  
• Immunosuppressants or other immune -modifying drugs administered chron ically 
(ie, > 14 days in total) during the study period. For corticosteroids, receipt of prednisone 
or the equivalent at a dose of ≥ 1  mg/kg/day (or ≥ 10  mg/day if participant 
weighs  > 10 kg) is not permitted. Inhaled, nasal, and topical steroids are allow ed. 
• Long -acting immune -modifying drugs administered at any time during the study period 
(eg, infliximab).  
• Immunoglobulins and/or any Ab -containing blood products administered during the 
study period.  
5.6 Intervention After the End of the Study  
Any SAE, including death, occurring after the end of the study, and considered to be caused by 
the IP must be reported to the Sponsor.

Confidential  Page 91 6 DELAYING OR DISCONTI NUING STUDY TREATMEN T AND 
PARTICIPANT WITHDRAW AL FROM THE STUDY  
6.1 Criteria for Delay of Vaccine Administration  
6.1.1 Individual Participant Criteria for Delay of Study Vaccination  
Body temperature (oral preferred for participants > 4 years of age or tympanic preferred for 
participants ≤  4 years of age, but other methods are acceptable in context of COVID -19 
precautions) must be measured on dosing visits before vaccine administration. The following 
events constitute criteria for delay of injection, and if any of these events occur at the time 
scheduled for dosing, the participant may receive the study injection at a later date within the 
time window specified in the SoA s (Section  10.1), or the participant may be discontinued from 
dosing at the discretion of the investigator ( Section  6.2): 
• Acute moderate or severe infection with or without fever at the time of dosing  
• Fever, defined as body temperature ≥ 38.0°C/≥  100.4°F at the time of dosing  
Participants with a minor illness without fever, as assessed by the investigator, can be 
vaccinated.  
Participants with a fever of ≥ 38.0°C/ ≥ 100.4°F will be contacted within the time window 
acceptable for participation and re -evaluated for e ligibility. If the investigator determines that the 
participant’s health on the day of dosing temporarily precludes injection, the visit should be 
rescheduled within the allowed interval for that visit.  
If a participant was  exposed to a household contact ( excluding school or other exposures) who 
tested positive for SARS -CoV -2 after the participant received the first dose, the administration of 
the second dose may be delayed to allow for at least 14 days between the positive test or the last 
day of symptoms (if present) of the  household contact and Dose 2 as long as the participant 
remains asymptomatic.  
If a participant tests positive for SARS -CoV -2 after having received Dose 1 but remains 
asymptomatic and the second dose is due before 14 days after the posit ive test, administration of 
the second dose may be delayed to allow for at least 14 days between the participant’s positive 
test and Dose 2 as long as participant remains asymptomatic.  The same applies for the interval 
between Dose 2 /cross -over Dose 2  and a booster dose /third dose . 
If a participant tests positive for SARS -CoV -2 after having received Dose 1 and develops 
symptoms of COVID -19, the participant may still receive a second dose, but the second dose 
should be delayed until approximately 90 days aft er diagnosis with COVID -19. The same applies 
for the interval between Dose 2 /cross -over Dose 2  and a booster dose /third dose . 
ModernaTX, Inc.  
mRNA -1273 -P204 Protocol Amendment 9  mRNA -1273  
Confidential  Page 92 If a participant takes a prohibited drug therapy, an injection could be delayed within the visit 
window based on the joint decisio n of the investigator and the CRO’s medical monitor 
(Section  5.5.2 ). 
If unforeseen circumstances out of the control of the participant ’s family or the study site 
(eg, extreme weather , such as hurricanes) render it impossible for the participant to receive the 
second dose within the specified window, Dose 2 may be delayed at the principal investigator ’s 
discretion but should be administere d as soon as possible  thereafter . 
6.2 Discontinuing Study Vaccination  
Participants can discontinue study injection (ie, refuse the second dose) for any reason, without 
prejudice to further treatment the participant may need to receive.  
The investigator, in con sultation with the Sponsor’s medical monitor, may withhold a participant 
from further injection under the following circumstances:  
• The participant becomes pregnant.  
• The participant’s parent(s)/LAR(s) withdraw consent or the participant withdraws 
assent.  
• An RT-PCR result from an illness visit ( Section 7.1.5 ) is positive for SARS -CoV -2 and 
the participant is symptomatic at the time of next injection.  
• The participant develops, during the course of the study, symptoms or conditions listed 
in the exc lusion criteria ( Section  4.2). 
• The participant experiences an AE (other than solicited reactogenicity) after injection 
that is considered by the in vestigator to be related to IP ( Section  7.4.9 ) and is of Grade  3 
(severe) or greater severity.  
• The participant experiences an AE or SAE that, in t he judgment of the investigator, 
requires IP withdrawal due to its nature, severity, or required treatment, regardless of the 
causal relationship to vaccine.  
• The participant experiences  an AESI (eg, MIS -C and myocarditis and/or pericarditis).  
• The participant experiences a clinically significant change in general condition that, in 
the judgment of the investigator, requires vaccine withdrawal.  
• The participant experiences anaphylaxis (described in Section 7.4.4 ) clearly related to 
IP. 
• The participant experiences generalized urticaria related to IP.  
ModernaTX, Inc.  
mRNA -1273 -P204 Protocol Amendment 9  mRNA -1273  
Confidential  Page 93 The reason(s) for withdrawal from further injection will be recorded in the eCRF.  
If a participant takes a prohibited drug therapy, the investigator could withhold the second  dose 
based on a joint decision of the investigator and the CRO’s medical monitor ( Section  5.5.2 ). 
Every reasonable attempt should be made to follow -up with participants for safety throughout 
the entire scheduled study period according to their regimen, even if the participant does not 
receive the second  dose or  misses one or more visits. Unless the participant’s parent(s)/LAR(s) 
withdraw consent or the participant withdraws assent, they are expected to remain in the study 
and complete all scheduled visits and assessments.  
6.3 Participant Discontinuation/Withdrawal from the Study  
Participants who withdraw or are withdrawn from the study will not be replaced. A “withdrawal” 
from the study refers to a situation wherein a participant does not return for the final visit 
planned in the protocol.  
The participant’s parent(s) /LAR(s) can withdraw consent or the participant can withdraw assent 
and withdraw from the study at any time, for any reason, without prejudice to further treatment 
the participant may need to receive. The investigator will request that the participant comp lete all 
study procedures pending at the time of withdrawal.  
If a participant desires to withdraw from the study because of an AE, the investigator will try to 
obtain agreement to follow -up with the participant until the event is considered resolved or sta ble 
and will then complete the end of the study eCRF.  
Information related to the withdrawal will be documented in the eCRF. The investigator will 
document whether the decision to withdraw a participant from the study was made by the 
participant or by the i nvestigator, as well as which of the following possible reasons was the 
cause for withdrawal:  
• AE (specify)  
• SAE (specify)  
• Death  
• Lost to follow -up (LTFU)  
• Physician decision (specify)  
• Pregnancy  
• Protocol deviation  
• Study terminated by Sponsor  
ModernaTX, Inc.  
mRNA -1273 -P204 Protocol Amendment 9  mRNA -1273  
Confidential  Page 94 • Withdrawal of consent by participant’s parent(s)/LAR(s) or withdrawal of assent by the 
participant (specify)  
• Other (specify)  
Participants who are withdrawn from the study because of AEs (including AESIs and SAEs) 
must be clearly distinguished from participants who are w ithdrawn for other reasons. 
Investigators will follow -up with participants who are withdrawn from the study as result of an 
SAE or AE until resolution of the event.  
A participant who withdraws from the study may request destruction of any samples taken and  
not tested, and the investigator must document this in the study site study records.  
If the participant’s parent(s)/LAR(s) withdraw consent or the participant withdraws assent for 
disclosure of future information, the Sponsor may retain and continue to us e any data collected 
before such a withdrawal of consent/assent ( Section  10.2.10 ). 
The Sponsor will continue to retain and use all research data th at have already been collected for 
the study evaluation, unless the participant has requested destruction of these samples. All 
biological samples that have already been collected may be retained and analyzed at a later date 
(or as permitted by local regul ations).  
Unblinding of still blinded participants based only on parental/LAR request and not related to a 
safety event or health concern before the participant has reached at least 6 months of follow  up 
after Dose 2 will not be permitted  to protect the data integrity of the blinded portion of the study. 
If a parent/LAR wishes to withdraw their child from the study, they may withdraw at any time 
but will only be able to learn the treatment group assignment once their child has reached at le ast 
6 months o f follow  up after Dose 2 or an unblinding trigger for the entire applicable age group is 
reached (eg, EUA granted for mRNA -1273 or a competitor vaccine) . 
6.3.1 End-of-Study Visit ( Prior to Day 394  or Day 5 14/BD -Day 366 ) 
Once a participant withdraws from the study, the investigator  (or delegate) should confirm all 
ongoing AEs have been addressed and answer any additional questions the participant may have; 
this may be done via a telephone call. The communication should be documented in the source. 
The End -of-Study/Study Discontinuation eCRF page must be completed.  
6.4 Study Pause Rules  
The investigators, study medical monitor, and Sponsor will monitor for events that could trigger 
a study pause. Study pause rule criteria, event s, and thresholds are described in Table  5.

enrolled participants in 
an age group  
61,2 Any ≥ Grade 3 or higher unsolicited AE that 
cannot be reasonably attributed to a cause other 
than vaccination  At least 2 participants 
and ≥  5% of the enrolled 
participants in an age 
group  
Abbreviations: AE = adverse event; AR = adverse reaction; COVID -19 = coronavirus disease 2019; ICU = intensive 
care unit; SAE = serious adverse event; SARS -CoV -2 = severe acute  respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.  
1  “Individual AR” is defined as 1 AR type, eg, pain, erythema, or headache could each be an “individual AR.”  
2  Events  in participants receiving booster doses will be considered  separate ly from the events during the primary 
vaccination series.  
If any of the thresholds for a study pause is met, the Sponsor will immediately suspend further 
enrollment and/or study dosing by notifying all investigators. Such a suspension will remain in 
force until the threshold events are  reviewed by the DSMB and a recommendation to continue is 
provided to the Sponsor.  
The investigator or designee is responsible for reporting to the Sponsor, via the electronic  data 
capture (EDC) system, each event that potentially meets any pause rule criterion within 24  hours 
of observation. If an SAE assessed as related to IP by the investigator is reported at any point, the 
Sponsor ’s medical monitor is responsible for a rapi d assessment (with the Sponsor’s Medical and 
Safety team) of whether pause rule # 2 has been met; the Sponsor medical monitor may consult 
with the DSMB chair as an independent entity to make that determination, as described in the 
DSMB charter.  
The Sponsor  will inform the DSMB of any event that meets any pause rule criterion. The DSMB 
will review all available study data to help adjudicate such events in accordance with the DSMB 
charter.  
ModernaTX, Inc.  
mRNA -1273 -P204 Protocol Amendment 9  mRNA -1273  
Confidential  Page 96 The Sponsor will notify the Center for Biologics and Evaluation Resear ch within 48  hours in the 
event of a study pause. In the event of a study pause, all safety and immunogenicity assessments 
will continue per protocol. The window allowance for injection visits may be extended by an 
additional 7 days (ie, + 21 days) for aff ected participants at the discretion of the Sponsor.  
6.5 Lost to Follow -up 
A participant  will be considered LTFU if he or she repeatedly fails to return for scheduled visits 
without stating an intention to withdraw consent/assent and is unable to be contacted by the 
study site. The following actions must be taken if a participant fails to ret urn to the clinic for a 
required study visit:  
• The study site staff must attempt to contact the participant and reschedule the missed 
visit as soon as possible, counsel the participant and his/her parent(s)/LAR(s) on the 
importance of maintaining the assign ed visit schedule and ascertain whether the 
participant wishes to and/or should continue in the study.  
• Before a participant is deemed LTFU, the investigator or designee must make every 
effort to regain contact with the participant (where possible, 3 teleph one calls and, if 
necessary, a certified letter to the participant’s last known mailing address or local 
equivalent methods). These contact attempts (eg, dates of telephone calls and 
registered letters) should be documented in the participant’s medical rec ord. 
• A participant who continues to be unreachable or continues to be noncompliant with 
study visits or procedures will be considered to have withdrawn from the study.  
• A participant should not be considered LTFU until due diligence has been completed.

Confidential  Page 97 7 STUD Y ASSESSMENTS AND PR OCEDURES  
Before performing any study procedures, all potential participants and/or participants’ 
parent(s)/LAR(s) will sign an ICF (as detailed in Section  10.2.6 ). Participants will undergo study 
procedures at the time points specified in the SoA s (Section  10.1). A participant can also be  seen 
for an unscheduled visit at any time during the study. An unscheduled visit may be prompted by 
reactogenicity issues, illness visit criteria for COVID -19 (as applicable while Part 2 of study is 
still blinded for any age group) , or new or ongoing A Es. The study site also has the discretion to 
make reminder telephone calls or send text messages to inform the participant and/or 
participant’s parent(s)/LAR(s) about visits, review eDiary requirements, or follow -up on ongoing 
or outstanding issues.  
In accor dance with “FDA Guidance on Conduct of Clinical Trials of Medical Products during 
COVID -19 Public Health Emergency” ( DHHS 2020 ), investigators may convert study site visits 
to home visits or telemedicine visits with the approva l of the Sponsor. Such action should be 
taken to protect the safety and well -being of study participants and study site staff or to comply 
with state or municipal mandates.  
General considerations for study assessments and procedures include the following:  
• Protocol waivers or exemptions are not allowed. The study procedures and their timing 
must be followed as presented in in the SoAs  (Section  10.1). Adherence to the study 
design requirements is essential and required for study conduct.  
• Immediate safety concerns should be discussed with the Sponsor immediately upon 
occurrence or awareness to determine if the participant should continue study treatment 
or participation in the study.  
• All screening evaluations must be completed and reviewed to confirm that potential 
participants meet all eligibility criteria. The investigator will maintain a screening log to 
record details of all participants screened and to confirm eligib ility or record reasons for 
screening failure, as applicable.  
• Procedures conducted as part of the participant’s routine clinical management 
(eg, pregnancy test) and obtained before signing of the ICF may be utilized for screening 
or baseline assessments pr ovided the procedures met the protocol -specified criteria and 
were performed within the time frame defined in in the SoAs  (Section  10.1). 
 
 
 
ModernaTX, Inc.  
mRNA -1273 -P204 Protocol Amendment 9  mRNA -1273  
Confidential  Page 98 7.1 Safety Assessments and  Procedures  
Safety assessments will include monitoring and recording of the following for each participant, 
according to the SoAs ( Section  10.1): 
• Solicited local and systemic ARs (Section  7.4.3 ) that occur during the 7 days fo llowing 
each injection (ie, the day of injection and 6 subsequent days). Solicited ARs will be 
recorded daily using eDiary ( Section  7.1.1 ). 
• Unsoli cited A Es observed or reported during the 28  days following each injection (ie, the 
day of injection and 27 subsequent days). Unsolicited AEs are defined in Section  7.4.1 . 
• AEs leading to discontinuation from dosing and/or study participation from Day  1 
through the last day of study participation.  
• MAAEs ( Section  7.4.4 ) from first dose on Day  1 through the entire study period.  
• SAEs ( Section  7.4.2 ) from first dose on Day  1 through the entire study period.  
• AESIs ( Section  7.4.5 ) including MIS -C and myocarditis and/or pericarditis, through the 
entire study period.  
• Physical examination findings ( Section  7.1.4 ). 
• Assessments for SARS -CoV -2 infection from Day  1 through study completion 
(Section  7.1.5 ). 
• Details of all pregnancies in female participants after the start of study treatment and until 
the end of their participation in the study ( Section  7.4.6 ). 
7.1.1 Use of Electronic Diaries  
At the time of consent, participants’ parent(s)/LAR(s) must confirm they will be willing to 
complete an eDiary using either an application downloaded to their smartphone or using a device 
that is provided at the time of enrollment. Before enrollment on Day  1, participants’ 
parent(s)/LAR(s) will be instructed to download the eDiary application or will be provided an 
eDiary device to record solicited ARs (Section  7.4.3 ) on Day  1. Based on availability, 
smartphone devices may be provided to those participants’ parent(s)/LAR(s) who do not have 
their own device to use for eDiary activities.  
At each injection visit, parti cipants’ parent(s)/LAR(s) will be instructed (Day  1) or reminded 
(Day  29, BD -Day 1 , if applicable ) on thermometer (oral/tympanic) usage to measure body 
temperature, ruler usage to measure injection site erythema and swelling/induration (hardness), 
and asse ssment for localized axillary swelling or tenderness on the same side as the injection 
arm/thigh.  
ModernaTX, Inc.  
mRNA -1273 -P204 Protocol Amendment 9  mRNA -1273  
Confidential  Page 99 At each injection visit, participants’ parent(s)/LAR(s) will record data into the eDiary starting 
approximately 30  minutes after injection under the supervisi on of the study site staff to ensure 
successful entry of assessments. The study site staff will perform any retraining as necessary. 
Participants’ parent(s)/LAR(s) will continue to record data in the eDiary after they leave the 
study site, preferably in th e evening and at the same time each day, on the day of injection and 
for 6 days following injection.  
Participants’ parent(s)/LAR(s) will record the following data in the eDiary:  
• Solicited local and systemic reactogenicity ARs, as defined in Section  7.4.3 , that occur on 
the day of each vaccine administration and during the 7 days after vaccine administration 
(ie, the day of injection and 6 sub sequent days). If a solicited local or systemic AR 
continues beyond Day  7 after vaccination, the participant’s parent(s)/LAR(s) will be 
prompted to capture details of the solicited local or systemic AR in the eDiary until it 
resolves or the next IP injecti on occurs, whichever occurs first. Capture of details of ARs 
in the eDiary should not exceed 28  days after each vaccination. Adverse reactions 
recorded in the eDiary beyond Day  7 should be reviewed by the study site staff either 
during the next scheduled t elephone call or at the next study site visit.  
• Daily oral ( for participants > 4 years of age ) or tympanic (for participants ≤  4 years of 
age) body temperature measurement should be performed at approximately the same time 
each day using the thermometer pro vided by the study site. If body temperature is taken 
more than once in a given day, only the highest temperature reading should be recorded.  
• Measurement, as applicable, for solicited local ARs (injection site erythema and 
swelling/induration); the size me asurements will be performed using the ruler provided 
by the study site.  
• Any medications taken to treat or prevent pain or fever on a day of injection or for the 
next 6  days.  
The eDiary will be the only source document allowed for solicited systemic or loc al ARs 
(including body temperature measurements). Participants’ parent(s)/LAR(s) will be instructed to 
complete eDiary entries daily. The participant’s parent(s)/LAR(s) will have a limited window on 
the following day to complete assessments for the previou s day; quantitative temperature 
recordings and measurement of any injection site erythema or swelling/induration reported on 
the following day may be excluded from the analyses of solicited ARs. 
Any new safety information reported during safety telephone c alls or at study site visits 
(including a solicited reaction) that is not already captured in the eDiary will be described in the 
source documents as a verbally reported event. An event reported in this manner must be 
described as a solicited event and ent ered on the solicited AR eCRF.  
ModernaTX, Inc.  
mRNA -1273 -P204 Protocol Amendment 9  mRNA -1273  
Confidential  Page 100 Study site staff will review eDiary data with participants’ parent(s)/LAR(s) at telemedicine visits 
7 days after each injection.  
The eDiary will also be used every 4  weeks, starting at Day  71 through Day  183 and again 
startin g at Day  223 through Day  363 for Parts 1 and 2 and starting Day 71 through Day 183 and 
again starting at Day 191 through Day 303  for Part 3 , to capture the occurrence of A Es, MAAEs, 
SAEs, AESI, or A Es leading to withdrawal.  
As specified in the SoAs ( Section  10.1), where applicable, the eDiary will prompt the 
participant’s parent(s)/LAR(s) to complete an eDiary questionnaire that collects the following 
data:  
• Changes in health since last completing the questionnaire or since in contact with the 
study site  
• Any MAAEs, AESIs, or SAEs  
• Known close contact with someone in the household who has known COVID -19 or 
SARS -CoV -2 infection. Per the CDC, “close contact” to someone with COVID -19 is 
defined as follows:  
− Being within 6 feet for a total of 15 minutes or more  
− Providing care at home  
− Having direct physical contact (hugged or kissed them)  
− Sharing eating or drinking utensils  
− Being sneezed or coughed upon or getting re spiratory droplets on the participant  
• Any experience of symptoms of COVID -19 
If an eDiary record results in identification of relevant safety events according to the study 
period or of symptoms of COVID -19, a follow -up safety telephone call will be trigger ed. 
Completion of eDiary questionnaires will alternate with safety telephone calls ( Section  7.1.2 ) as 
the procedure for safety follow -up approximately every 4 weeks; these safety telephone calls will 
take place from Day 85 through Day  197 and again from Day  237 through Day  377 ( Table  12). 
For Part 3, these safety telephone calls will take place from Day 85 through Day 197 and again 
from Day 205 through Day 317 (Table 17). 
Ancillary Supplies for Participant Use  
Study sites will distribute Sponsor -provided oral or tympanic thermometers and rulers for use by 
participants’ parent(s)/LAR(s) in assessing body temperature and injection site reactions for

may be provided to those participants’ parent(s)/LAR(s) who do not have their own device to use 
for eDiary activities.  
7.1.2 Safety Telephone Calls  
A safety telephone call is a telephone call made to the participants’ parent(s)/L AR(s) by trained 
study site personnel. This call will follow a script, which will facilitate the collection of relevant 
safety information. Safety telephone calls follow a schedule for each participant as indicated in 
in the SoAs ( Section  10.1). The participants’ parent(s)/LAR(s) will be interviewed according to 
the script about the occurrence of A Es, MAAEs, SAEs, AESI, A Es leading to study withdrawal, 
concomitant m edications associated with those events, and any nonstudy vaccinations 
(Section  7.4.7 ). In addition, study personnel will collect information on known participant 
exposure to someone with known COVID -19 or SARS -CoV -2 infection and on participant 
experience of COVID -19 symptoms. All safety information collected from the telephone contact 
must be documented in source documents as described by the par ticipant’s parent(s)/LAR(s) and 
not documented on the script used for the safety telephone contact. As noted in Section  7.1.1 , an 
unscheduled foll ow-up safety telephone call may be triggered if an eDiary record results in 
identification of a relevant safety event.  
7.1.3 Safety Laboratory Assessments  
No scheduled laboratory assessments for safety are planned. This is based on the absence of 
clinically sign ificant abnormal laboratory findings in the Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies of 
mRNA -1273 in adults.  
A point -of-care urine pregnancy test will be performed, if deemed appropriate by the 
investigator, at the Screening Visit and before each vaccine dose in female  participants of 
childbearing potential. At any time during the study, a pregnancy test either via blood or point -
of-care urine can be performed, at the discretion of the investigator.  
Febrile participants at dosing visits (fever is defined as a body tempe rature ≥  38.0°C/≥  100.4°F) 
may have visits rescheduled within the relevant study visit windows. Afebrile participants with 
minor illnesses may receive the IP at the discretion of the investigator.  
7.1.4 Physical Examinations  
A full physical examination, includin g body temperature (oral preferred for participants > 4 years 
of age, tympanic preferred for participants ≤ 4 years of age, but other methods are acceptable in 
context of COVID -19 precautions), length/height and weight, will be performed at the Screening 
Visit or on Day 1. For p articipants receiving booster doses, symptom -directed physical 
examination  will be performed on BD -Day 1.  The full examination will include assessment of 
ModernaTX, Inc.  
mRNA -1273 -P204 Protocol Amendment 9  mRNA -1273  
Confidential  Page 102 skin, head, ears, eyes, nose, throat, neck, lungs, heart, abdomen, lymph nodes,  and 
musculoskeletal system/extremities. Any clinically significant finding identified during a study 
visit should be reported as an MAAE.  
Symptom -directed physical examinations will be performed  per the SoAs found in Section  10.1 
(Appendix 1)  and may be performed at other time points at the discretion of the investigator. 
Body temperature (oral/tympanic) should be measured on each injection day prior to injection. 
On each injection day before injection and again 7 days after injection (ie, the day of injection 
and 6 subsequent days), the injection site should be examined. Any clinically significant finding 
identified during a study visit should be reported as an MAA E. 
Participants who are febrile (body temperature ≥ 38.0°C/≥ 100.4°F) before injection on Day 1 or 
Day 29 must have the visit rescheduled within the relevant visit window to receive the injection. 
Afebrile participants with minor illnesses may be injected at the discretion of the investigator.  
Body mass index will be calculated for children ≥ 2 years of age at the Screening Visit only.  
7.1.5 Assessment for SARS -CoV -2 Infection  
Study participants will have nasal swab samples collected for SARS -CoV -2 testing at the time 
points specified in in the SoAs ( Section  10.1). 
While Part 2 of the study is still blinded for any age group, a  study illness visit (study si te visit or 
home visit) will be arranged within 72  hours or as soon as possible if a participant experiences 
any of the following:  
• Signs or symptoms of SARS -CoV -2 infection as defined by the CDC ( CDC  2020b ) 
• MAAE suggesting a SARS -CoV -2 infection  
For asymptomatic children, a  study visit (study site visit or home visit) will be arranged 
approximately 7  days after the diagnosis of COVID -19 in a household, if  a participant 
experiences the following:  
• Exposure (close contact [defini tion in Section  7.1.1 ]) to an individual in the household 
confirmed to be infected with SARS -CoV -2. For the purpose of calculating the day of the 
study visit, 7 days will be calculated from the first day of illness or positive COVID -19 
test, whichever day is earlier, in a household contact.  
A negative l ocal diagnostic test (NAAT)  may be us ed to satisfy the study visit, provided that the 
participant rema ins asymptomatic for COVID -19 and the test is collected at least 5 days after the 
index case in a household.  
In accordance with CDC guidance on COVID -19 testing, exposure visits are not required for 
participants who are within 90 days of a COVID -19 illness  (from the date of positive COVID -19 
ModernaTX, Inc.  
mRNA -1273 -P204 Protocol Amendment 9  mRNA -1273  
Confidential  Page 103 test). Illness visits should still be performed, even if within 90 days of a previous COVID -19 
infection, for participants with signs/symptoms consistent with COVID -19. 
During a surge in SARS -CoV -2 infections across the  US and Canada and given the changing 
practice of using home tests to diagnose SARS -CoV -2 infections, the following alternative 
process may be used for assessment of SARS -CoV -2 infection:  
If an illness visit is not feasible due to COVID -19 related restrict ions at site or in the wider 
community, a telehealth visit or phone call combined with a local diagnostic test to be recorded 
under an unscheduled visit eCRF page, can substitute for a clinic visit.  
If due to COVID -19 related restrictions in the community,  the participant’s LAR performed a 
home test rather than obtaining a test performed by a health care professional, the following 
process should apply:  
• If the participant is asymptomatic but was exposed to a positive household member, and 
the home test obta ined within the appropriate window (4 -6 days post -exposure) was 
negative , the investigator may report the result of the home test under the local 
diagnostic lab page as an unscheduled visit and forego the illness visit.  
• If the participant reports symptoms but home test was negative , the investigator may 
report symptoms as ‘URI’ or other appropriate AE and report the negative home test on 
the local diagnostic lab page for an unscheduled visit, and forego the illness visit.  
• If the participant reports symptoms , or is asymptomatic after a household exposure, and 
the home test was positive , the investigator should encourage the family to seek 
confirmatory PCR -based testing at a local testing center or return to site for an illness 
visit.  
− If a local confirmatory P CR-based test is obtained, the investigator may report the 
result under an unscheduled visit and forego the illness visit.  
− If due to COVID -19 related restrictions at the site or in the community, neither a local 
test nor an illness visit is feasible, the i nvestigator may report the result of the home 
test under the local diagnostic lab page as an unscheduled visit and forego the illness 
visit. 
If the participant had a known exposure (close contact) to COVID -19 (eg, exposure to someone 
with confirmed COVID -19 in the household ), it will be captured in the COVID -19 exposure 
form.  
Additionally, clinical information will be carefully collected to evaluate the severity of the 
clinical case.  
ModernaTX, Inc.  
mRNA -1273 -P204 Protocol Amendment 9  mRNA -1273  
Confidential  Page 104 At each study illness visit, an initial assessment will be performed to de termine general 
appearance. This initial assessment may be performed by physicians, advanced practice nurses, 
physician assistants, or registered nurses. If indicated, a physical examination by a study 
clinician (MD, DO, NP, or PA experienced in pediatric examination) may occur.  
The study illness visit (study site visit or home visit) may collect additional clinical information, 
including assessments such as updated medical history, physical examination, blood sampling 
for clinical laboratory testing,  and nasal swab sampling for viral RT -PCR to evaluate the severity 
of the clinical case. Radiologic imaging studies may be conducted. Study site may also collect an 
additional nasal  swab sample for SARS -CoV -2 testing to be able to render appropriate medical 
care for the study participant as determined by local standards of care. All findings will be 
recorded in the eCRF.  
If participants are confirmed to have SARS -CoV -2 infection, the  investigator will notify the 
participant’s parent(s)/LAR(s) and the participant’s primary care physician of the diagnosis via 
fax or other Health Information Portability and Accountability Act compliant electronic data 
transfer (eg , e-mail if applicable).  If the study participant does not have a primary care physician, 
the investigator will assist them to obtain one. The participant will also be instructed on infection 
prevention measures consistent with local public health guidance. Laboratory test result s for 
SARS -CoV -2 infection in study participants should be submitted to state or local public health 
departments according to local policy. The investigator must either directly report to state or 
local public health department or obtain confirmation from the participant’s primary care 
physician that the positive test was reported.  
Any confirmed symptomatic SARS -CoV -2 infection that occurs in participants will be captured 
as an MAAE along with relevant concomitant medications and details about severity, 
seriousness, and outcome. Additionally, a convalescent visit may be scheduled approximately 
28 days (+ 7 days) after diagnosis ( Section 7.3.3 ) if ther e are any doubts about the initial 
diagnosis (at the discretion of the principal investigator [ PI]). At this visit  a blood sample for 
potential immunologic assessment of SARS -CoV -2 infection will be collected.  
If a participant tests positive at baseline bu t remains asymptomatic  and there are doubts about the 
validity of the positive test , Day 29 visit can be used as the convalescent visit to obtain a 
convalescent blood sample  (at the discretion of the PI) ; the second dose may still be administered 
as long a s participant remains asymptomatic and no other concerns arise.  
Once the trial is unblinded for all age groups and thus no placebo comparator group is available 
going forward, illness visits for COVID -19 symptoms or exposures and convalescent visits will 
no longer be required.  COVID -19 will then be reported under regular AE reporting as per SoA.

Confidential  Page 105 7.2 Blood Collections for Immunogenicity Assessments and Biomarker 
Samples  
Blood samples for immunogenicity assessments  and biomarker samples  will be collected at the 
time points indicated in in the SoAs ( Section  10.1). The following analytes will be measured:  
• Serum nAb titer against SARS -CoV -2 as measur ed by pseudovirus and/or live virus 
neutralization assays.  
• Serum bAb titer as measured by enzyme -linked immunosorbent assay specific to the 
SARS -CoV -2 S protein.  
• For Part 1, testing for serologic markers for SARS -CoV -2 infection using a nonvaccine 
antigen -based blood test at Day 1 (prior to the first dose), Day 57, Day 209, and Day  394. 
For Part 2, participants in each age group will be assigned to 5 phlebotomy cohorts. Blood 
sampling will be performed in 3 of these 5 cohorts for immunogenicity at 3 of the following time 
points: Day 1 (prior to randomization and the first dose), Day 57, and one of Day 29 (prior to the 
second dose), Day 209, and Day 394. Participants in the Cohort D  (remainder of the age group) 
will provide a blood sample at Day 1 (prior to r andomization and the first dose) and within 4 
days of receiving Dose 2 at Day 3 0 (+3 days) for storage and potential future biomarker testing  
(may include cardiac biomarkers) . For participants already enrolled in Cohort D prior to  
Amendment 4, this blood draw will be optional and confirmed at time of re -consenting; for all 
participants newly enrolled into Cohort D under Amendment 4, it will be mandatory.  A fifth 
cohort of participants at selected VTEU sites only, will provide blood samples for  assessment of 
exploratory serology and CMI on Day  1 (prior to randomization and the first dose), Day  43, 
Day 209, and Day 394.  
All participants in Part 3 of the study will provide blood specimens for immunogenicity on Day  1 
(prior to the first dose) and w ill also provide additional samples at Day 57, Day 149/BD-Day 1, 
one month after the third dose on Day 177/ BD -Day 29. The first 150 participants 
(Sub-Cohort  F) will also have a blood draw on Day 3 29/BD-Day 18 1; the second 
150 participants ( Sub-Cohort G) will also have a blood draw on  Day 5 14/BD-Day 366. 
All p articipants  in Part 1 and Part 2 who choose to receive a booster dose  will provide a blood 
specimen for immunogenicity  and serostatus  on BD -Day 1 ; a subgroup of participants will also 
provide one addi tional blood specimen fo r immunogenicity. Please see Table  16 for details.  
Sample aliquots will be designed to have backup samples, if possible; vial  volumes will likely be 
adequate for future testing needs. The actual time and date of each sample collected will be 
recorded in the eCRF, and unique sample identification will be utilized to maintain the blind at 
the laboratory at all times and to allow f or automated sample tracking and housing. Handling and

Confidential  Page 106 preparation of the samples for analysis, as well as shipping and storage requirements, will be 
provided in a separate study laboratory manual.  
Measurement of bAb and nAb levels will be performed in a laboratory designated by the 
Sponsor.  
According to the ICF section ( Section  10.2.6 ), serum from immunogenicity testing may be used 
for future resea rch, which may be performed at the discretion of the Sponsor to further 
characterize the immune response to SARS -CoV -2, additional assay development, and the 
immune response across CoVs.  
The planned volume of blood to be sampled per participant in Part 1 , Part 2 , and Part 3  (serology 
cohorts) for each age group for immunogenicity assessments in 1 day is as follows:  
• 6 months to < 2 years: approximately 8  mL 
• 2 years to < 6 years: approximately 16  mL 
• 6 years to < 12 years: approximately 24  mL 
The planned volum e of blood to be sampled per participant at the Day 3 0 (+3 days)  blood draw 
for storage and potential future biomarker testing for Cohort D in Part 2 is as follows:  
• All ages: approximately 4 mL  
The planned volume of blood to be sampled per participant in the exploratory serology and CMI 
cohort for each age group in 1 day is as follows:  
• 6 months to < 2 years: approximately 9  mL 
• 2 years to < 6 years: approximately 9  mL 
• 6 years to < 12 years: approximately 17  mL 
Note:  If less than 8  mL of blood  is obtained fo r any given child at baseline, except for Cohort  D 
for 6  months  to < 2 years, where 4 mL can be obtained,  the child cannot  be enrolled.  
Blood volumes for Booster phase:  
• BD-Day 1 (pre -booster)  and post -booster  draw for 2 year to < 12-year-old children  (at 
time of booster ): approximately 8 mL . 
• BD-Day 1 (pre -booster) and post -booster draw for 6  months to < 2 year-old children  (at 
time of booster ): approximately 4 m L.

7.3.1 Vaccine Effectiveness Assessments  
Vaccine effectiveness for children 6 months to < 12 years of age will be inferred based on serum 
antibody responses obtained on Day 57 (28 days after the second injection of mRNA -1273). 
Inference will be based on assessing the antibody responses against the following:  
1.  If available at the time of analysis , antibody responses will be assessed against an 
accepted serum antibody threshold conferring protection against COVID -19. 
2.  If an accepted threshold of protection is not available , noninferiority of the GM value of 
serum an tibody and SRR  of children 6 months to < 12 years of age (Study  P204) 
compared with the GM value of serum antibody and SRR  from young adults (18 to 
25 years of age) enrolled in the ongoing clinical endpoint efficacy trial (Study P301) will 
be assessed. The  statistical parameters to infer effectiveness are described in  Section  8. 
COVID -19: 
To be considered as a case of COVID -19 for the evaluation of the efficacy endpoint, the 
following case definition must be met:  
• The participant must have at least 1 nasal swab (or respiratory sample, if hospitalized) 
positive for SARS -CoV -2 by RT -PCR AND  
• ONE of the following:  
− Fever (temperature ≥ 38ºC/≥  100.4ºF) or chills (of any duration, including ≤  4 hours)  
− Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing (of any duration, including ≤  48 hours)

mRNA -1273 -P204 Protocol Amendment 9  mRNA -1273  
Confidential  Page 110 Once the trial is unblinded for all age  groups and thus no placebo comparator group is available 
going forward, COVID -19 surveillance will be discontinued,  and COVID -19 cases will be 
reported under standard AE reporting per SoA only.  
While Part 2 is still blinded for any age group, s urveillance for COVID -19 symptoms will be 
conducted via biweekly telephone calls or eDiary prompts as specified in Section 7.1.1  and 
Figure  2; starting after participant enrollment and continuing throughout the study.  
If there is no response to an eDiary prompt for 2 days, the study site staff w ill contact the study 
participant by telephone.  
According to the CDC, as of 22 Dec 2020 ( CDC 2020c ), patients with COVID -19 have reported 
a wide range of symptoms ranging from mild symptoms to severe illness. Throughout the stu dy 
while Part 2 for any age group is still blinded , to survey for COVID -19, the following pre -
specified symptoms that meet the criteria for suspicion of COVID -19 will be elicited weekly 
from the participant, and the presence of any one of these symptoms (i n the absence of an 
alternative diagnosis) lasting at least 48  hours (except for fever and/or respiratory symptoms) 
will result in the study site staff arranging an illness visit to collect a nasal swab for SARS -CoV -
2 within 72  hours.  
• Fever (temperature ≥ 38ºC/≥  100.4ºF) or chills (of any duration, including ≤ 48 hours)  
• Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing (of any duration, including ≤ 48 hours)  
• Cough (of any duration, including ≤ 48 hours)  
• Fatigue  
• Muscle or body aches  
• Headache  
• New loss of taste or smell  
• Sore throat  
• Congestion or runny nose  
• Abdominal pain  
• Nausea or vomiting

It is important to note that some of the symptoms of COVID -19 overlap with soli cited systemic 
ARs that are expected after vaccination with mRNA -1273 (eg, myalgia, headache, fever, and 
chills). During the first 7 days after vaccination, when these solicited ARs are common, 
investigators should use their clinical judgment to decide if a nasal swab should be collected. The 
collection of a nasal swab prior to the first dose on Day 1, prior to the second dose on Day  29, 
and then at all subsequent study visits (Day 43 [if visit is applicable], Day 57, Day  209, and 
Day 394) can help ensure t hat cases of COVID -19 are not overlooked.  If the participant decides 
to receive the optional booster dose, nasal swabs should be collected as described in  Table 15.

Confidential  Page 112 Any study participant who reports respiratory symptoms during the 7 -day period after 
vaccination without an alternative diagnosis should be evaluated for COVID -19. 
For children with febrile illnesses, if an alternative diagnosis is identified (eg, positive urine 
culture, streptococcal pharyngitis, cellulitis), the investigator may decide to omit the illness visit.  
Identification of an alternative viral agent (such as respiratory syn cytial vir us or influenza by 
rapid testing) does not satisfy this requirement, as co -infections with SARS -CoV -2 may occur.  
An investigator may elect to omit the illness visit if standard of care testing prior to the illness 
visit reveals a negative COVID -19 nucleic acid amplification test performed at a Clinical 
Laboratory Improvement Amendment s (CLIA) -certified or CLIA -waived laboratory  and the 
principal investigator  can obtain a copy of the negative test . Home testing kits cannot be used to 
satisfy this testing req uirement. Standard of care evaluation of household contacts that reveals a 
negative COVID -19 is not sufficient to omit an illness visit in the study participant . 
During the course of the study  when Part 2 for any age group is still blinded  participants wit h 
symptoms of COVID -19 will be asked to return within 72  hours or as soon as possible to the 
study site or trained staff from the study site will conduct a home visit as soon as possible to 
collect a nasal swab sample (for RT -PCR) for evaluation of COVID -19. Both study site visits 
and home visits are referred to as illness visits ( Section 7.1.5 ). Additionally, a convalescent visit 
may be scheduled approximately 28  days (+7  days) after diagnosis ( Section 7.3.3 ) if there are 
any doubts about the initial diagnosis (at the discretion of the investigator) . At this visit, a blood 
sample will be collected for potential immunologic assessment of SARS -CoV -2 infection.  
Once the trial is un blinded for all age groups and thus no placebo comparator group is available 
going forward, illness visits for COVID -19 symptoms or exposures and convalescent visits will 
no longer be required.  
Cases are defined as participants meeting clinical criteria ba sed both on symptoms for 
COVID -19 and on RT -PCR detection of SARS -CoV -2 from samples collected within 72  hours 
of the study participant reporting symptoms meeting the definition of COVID -19. Participants 
who are hospitalized for COVID -19 without the opport unity for a clinic or home visit will also 
be considered cases, assuming that the symptomology criteria for COVID -19 are met and a 
respiratory sample is positive for SARS -CoV -2 by RT -PCR at a certified laboratory.  
Investigators are encouraged to try to obt ain a respiratory sample during the course of 
hospitalization or immediately after hospital discharge as an unscheduled visit for submission to 
the study central laboratory, if feasible. The investigator should determine if the criteria for 
severe COVID -19 have been met.  
Severe COVID -19 is defined in Section 7.3.1 . 
ModernaTX, Inc.  
mRNA -1273 -P204 Protocol Amendment 9  mRNA -1273  
Confidential  Page 113 All clinical findings will be recorded in the eCRF. While COVID -19 surveillance is on going, a ll 
confirmed cases of symptomatic  COVID -19 will be captured as MAAEs, along with relevant 
concomitant medications and details about severity, seriousness, and outcome, and will be 
reported immediately to the Sponsor or designee ( Section  7.4.4 ). Once COVID -19 surveillance is 
discontinued, COVID -19 cases will be reported as per standard AE reporting (only if medically 
attended, SAEs or leading to discontinuation from study or vaccination).  
7.3.3 Follow -up/Convalescent Period After Diagnosis with COVID -19 
Any confirmed symptomatic  COVID -19 occurring in a participant will be captured as an MAAE 
along with relevant concomitant medications and det ails about severity, seriousness, and 
outcome. Additionally, a convalescent visit may be scheduled approximately 28  days (+  7 days) 
after diagnosis  if there are any doubts about the initial diagnosis (at the discretion of the PI) . At 
this visit, a blood sa mple for potential immunologic assessment of SARS -CoV -2 infection will 
be collected ( see the SoAs [ Section 10.1]). The investigator should determine if the criteria for 
severe COVID -19 have been met. If the participant is hospitalized, study site personnel will try 
to obtain medical records and SARS -CoV -2 diagnostic results. If the participant is later 
discharged from the hospital during the 28 -day period fol lowing diagnosis of COVID -19, the 
study site personnel will arrange for a resumption of the protocol schedule.  
Children hospitalized with possible or confirmed MIS -C may also have the same convalescent 
visit scheduled approximately 28 days (+7 days) after onset of hospitalization  at the 
Invest igator’s discretion . At this visit, a blood sample for potential immunologic assessment of 
SARS -CoV -2 infection will be collected (see the SoAs [ Section  10.1]). 
Once the trial is unblinded for all age groups and thus no placebo comparator group is available 
going forward, convalescent visits will no longer be required.  
7.4 Safety Definitions and Related Procedures  
7.4.1 Adverse Event  
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in 
humans, whether or not considered drug related.  
Events Meeting the Adverse Event Definition  
• Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre -existing condition including either an 
increase in frequency and/or intensity of the condition.  
• New conditions detected or diagnosed after the first dose of IP even though they may 
have been present before the start of the study.  
ModernaTX, Inc.  
mRNA -1273 -P204 Protocol Amendment 9  mRNA -1273  
Confidential  Page 114 Events NOT Meeting the Adverse Event Definition  
• Medical  or surgical procedure (eg, endoscopy, appendectomy): the condition that leads to 
the procedure should be the AE.  
• Situations in which an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or 
convenience admission to a hospital).  
• Planned procedures (eg, tonsillectomy or pressure -equalization tubes) that occur during 
the study period but were planned prior to enrollment will not be considered AE unless 
complications arise.  
An AR is any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that the vaccine caused the AE 
(Section  7.4.9 ). For the purposes of IND safety reporting, “reasonable possibility” means that 
there is evidence to suggest a causal relati onship between the vaccine and the AE.  
An unsolicited AE is any AE reported by the participant that is not specified as a solicited AR in 
the protocol or is specified as a solicited AR but starts outside the protocol -defined period for 
reporting solicited ARs (ie, the day of each dose of injection and the 6  days after the day of 
dosing ). 
7.4.2 Serious Adverse Events  
An AE (including an AR) is considered an SAE if, in the view of either the investigator or 
Sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes:  
• Deat h 
A death that occurs during the study or that comes to the attention of the investigator 
during the protocol -defined follow -up period must be reported to the Sponsor, whether or 
not it is considered related to the IP.  
• Is life -threatening   
An AE is conside red life -threatening if, in the view of either the investigator or the 
Sponsor, its occurrence places the participant at immediate risk of death. It does not 
include an AE that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.  
• Inpatient hosp italization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
In general, inpatient hospitalization indicates the participant was admitted to the hospital 
or emergency ward for at least one overnight stay for treatment that would not have been 
appropriate in the  physician’s office or outpatient setting. The hospital or emergency 
ward admission should be considered an SAE regardless of whether opinions differ as to 
the necessity of the admission. Complications that occur during inpatient hospitalization 
will be re corded as A Es; however, if a complication/AE prolongs hospitalization or 
ModernaTX, Inc.  
mRNA -1273 -P204 Protocol Amendment 9  mRNA -1273  
Confidential  Page 115 otherwise fulfills SAE criteria, the complication/AE will be recorded as a separate SAE. 
Note: 24 -hour observation admissions, typically used to extend the period of observation 
from an emergency department or urgent care visit, will not be considered inpatient 
hospitalization unless they are converted to hospital admission after the 24 hours of 
observation have expired.  
• Persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of  the ability to conduct 
normal  life functions  
This definition is not intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical 
significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and 
accidental trauma (eg, sprained ankle) t hat may interfere with or prevent everyday life 
functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption.  
• Congenital anomaly or birth defect  
• Medically important event   
Medical judgment should be exercised in deciding whether SAE reporting is appropriate 
in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be immediately 
life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization but that jeopardize the participant or 
require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes list ed in the 
above definition. These events should usually be considered serious. Examples of such 
medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an 
emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result i n 
inpatient hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
7.4.3 Solicited Adverse Reactions  
The term “reactogenicity” refers to the occurrence and intensity of selected signs and symptoms 
(ARs) that occur after IP injection. The eDiary wi ll solicit daily participant reporting of ARs 
using a structured checklist ( Section  7.1.1 ). Participant’s parent(s)/LAR(s) will record such 
occurr ences in an eDiary on the day of each dose of injection and for the 6  days after the day of 
dosing.  
Severity grading of reactogenicity will occur automatically based on participant entry into the 
eDiary according to the grading scales presented in Table  8 and Table 9, modified from the 
Toxicity Grading Scale for Healthy Adult and Adolescent Volunteers Enrolled in Preventative 
Vaccine Clinical Trials ( DHHS 2007 ). 
If a solicited local or systemic AR continues beyond Day 7 after vaccination, the participant’s 
parent(s)/LAR(s) will be prompted to capture details of the solicited local or systemic AR in the 
eDiary until it resolves or the next IP injection occurs, whichever occurs fi rst. Capture of details 
of ARs in the eDiary should not exceed 28 days after each vaccination. Adverse reactions 
ModernaTX, Inc.  
mRNA -1273 -P204 Protocol Amendment 9  mRNA -1273  
Confidential  Page 116 recorded in the eDiary beyond Day  7 should be reviewed by the study site staff either during the 
next scheduled telephone call or at the next s tudy site visit. All solicited ARs (local and 
systemic) will be considered related to the IP.  
After booster doses with mRNA -1273.214, local or systemic ARs will only be reported if they 
are medically attended, considered serious or lead to discontinuation from the study. No eDiaries 
will be used after booster doses with mRNA -1273.214.

participant’s eCRF:  
• Solicited local or systemic AR that results in a visit to a healthcare practitioner (HCP; 
otherwise meets the definition of an MAAE)  
• Solicited local or systemic AR leading to the participant withdrawing from the study or

Confidential  Page 119 • Solicited local or systemic AR that otherwise meets the definition of an SAE  
7.4.4 Med ically Attended Adverse Events  
An MAAE is an AE that leads to an unscheduled visit to an HCP. This would include visits to a 
study site for unscheduled assessments (eg, abnormal laboratory test result follow -up, 
COVID -19 [Section  7.3.1 ]) and visits to HCPs external to the study site (eg, urgent care, primary 
care physician). Investigators will review unsolicited A Es for the occurrence of any MAAE. 
Unsolicited A Es will be captured on the AE page of the eCRF.  
While COVID -19 surveillance is ongoing, a ll confirmed symptomatic  COVID -19 cases 
(Section  7.3.1 ) will be recorded as MAAEs . Any severe COVID -19 cases will be reported to the 
Sponsor or designee immediately and in all circumstances within 24 hours, using the SAE 
Mailbox, the SAE Hotline, or the SAE Fax line ( Section  7.4.11 ). The investigator will submit 
any updated COVID -19 case data to the Sponsor within 24  hours of it being available.  
Once COVID -19 surveillance is discontinued, COVID -19 related AEs will be reported per 
standard AE reporting for the respective SoA.  
All suspected cases of anaphylaxis should be recorded as MAAEs and reported as an SAE, based 
on criteria for a medically important event, unless the event meets other serious  criteria. As an 
SAE, the event should be reported to the Sponsor or designee immediately and in all 
circumstances within 24 hours as per Section  7.4.11 . The investigator will submit any updated 
anaphylaxis case data to the Sponsor within 24 hours of it being available. For reporting 
purposes, a participant who displays signs/symptoms consistent with anaphylaxis as described 
below should be reported as  a potential case of anaphylaxis. This is provided as general guidance 
for investigators and is based on the Brighton Collaboration case definition ( Rüggeberg et al 
2007 ). 
Anaphylaxis is an acute hypersensitivity reaction wi th multi -organ -system involvement that can 
present as, or rapidly progress to, a severe life -threatening reaction. It may occur following 
exposure to allergens from a variety of sources.  
Anaphylaxis is a clinical syndrome characterized by:  
Sudden onset AND  
Rapid progression of signs and symptoms AND  
Involves 2 or more organ systems, as follows:  
− Skin/mucosal: urticaria (hives), generalized erythema, angioedema, generalized 
pruritus with skin rash, generalized prickle sensation, red and itchy eyes

loss of consciousness or decreased level of consciousness, evidence of reduced 
peripheral circulation  
− Respiratory:  bilateral wheeze (bronchospasm), difficulty breathing, strid or, upper 
airway swelling (lip, tongue, throat, uvula, or larynx), respiratory distress, persistent 
dry cough, hoarse voice, sensation of throat closure, sneezing, rhinorrhea  
− Gastrointestinal:  diarrhea, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting  
7.4.5 Adverse Events of Sp ecial Interest  
An AESI is an AE (serious or nonserious) of scientific and medical concern specific to the 
Sponsor’s product or program for which ongoing monitoring and immediate notification by the 
investigator to the Sponsor is required and documentation in the form of a case narrative. Such 
events may require further investigation to characterize and understand them. Refer to 
Section  10.4, Appendix 4 for a list of AESIs pertinent to this study. All AESIs will be collected 
through the entire study period and must be reported to the Sponsor or designee immediately and 
in all circumstances within 24 hours of becoming aware of the event via th e EDC system. If a 
site receives a report of a new AESI from a study participant or receives updated data on a 
previously reported AESI and the eCRF has been taken offline, then the site can report this 
information on a paper AESI form using the SAE Mailbo x, the SAE Hotline, or the SAE Fax 
line ( Section 7.4.11 ). 
Acute Myocarditis and/or Pericarditis  
All suspected cases of probable and confirmed myocardi tis, pericarditis, or myopericarditis 
should be recorded as an AESI and reported as an SAE, if the event meets seriousness criteria. 
As an SAE, the event should be reported to the Sponsor or designee immediately and in all 
circumstances within 24 hours as per Section  7.4.11 . The investigator will submit any updated 
myocarditis, pericarditis or myopericarditis case data to the Sponsor within 24 hours of it being 
available. For reporting purposes, a participant who displays signs/symptoms consistent with the 
CDC case definition as described below ( Gargano et al, 2021 ), should be reported as a potential 
case of confirmed or probable myocarditis, pericard itis, or myopericarditis.  
Acute M yocarditis  Case Definition  
Presence of ≥ 1 new or worsening of the following clinical symptoms (persons who lack the 
listed symptoms but who meet other criteria may be classified as subclinical myocarditis 
[probable or conf irmed]):  
• Chest pain/pressure/discomfort  
ModernaTX, Inc.

Infants and children aged < 12 years might instead have ≥ 2 of the following symptoms:  
• Irritability  
• Vomiting  
• Poor feeding  
• Tachypnea  
• Lethargy  
AND  
For PROBABLE CASE:  
Presence of ≥ 1 new finding of the following:  
• Troponin level above upper limit of normal (any type of troponin)  
• Abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG ) or rhythm monitoring findings consistent 
with myocarditis  
o To meet the ECG or rhythm monitoring criterion, a probable case must include at 
least one of the following:  
▪ ST segment or T -wave abnormalities  
▪ Paroxysmal or sustained atrial, supraventricular, or ventricular 
arrhythmias  
▪ AV nodal conduction delays or intraventricular conduction defe cts 
• Abnormal cardiac function or wall motion abnormalities on echocardiogram  
• cMRI finding consistent with myocarditis ( Ferreira et al, 2018 ) 
AND  
• No other identifiable cause of the symptoms and findings  
For CONFIRMED CASE:  
• Histopathologic confirmation of myocarditis (using Dallas criteria [ Aretz, 1987 ])

Confidential  Page 122 OR 
• cMRI findings consistent with myocarditis in the presence of troponin level above upper 
limit of normal (any type of troponin)  
AND  
• No other identifiable cause of the symptoms and findings  
Acute Pericardi tis Case Definition  
Presence of  ≥ 2 new or worsening of the following clinical features (Adler, et al 2015) : 
• Acute chest pain (Typically described as pain made worse by lying down, deep 
inspiration, or cough; and relieved by sitting up or leaning forward,  although other types 
of chest pain may occur)  
• Pericardial rub on examination  
• New ST -elevation or PR -depression on EKG  
• New or worsening pericardial effusion on echocardiogram or MRI  
Myopericarditis Case Definition  
Participants who meet criteria for both my ocarditis and pericarditis may be described under 
myopericarditis.  
An independent Cardiac Event  Adjudication Committee (CEAC)  consisting of pediatric and 
adult cardiologists will review suspected cases of myocarditis, pericarditis, or myopericarditis to 
determine if they meet CDC criteria of “probable” or “confirmed” event, and to assess severity 
and enable the DSMB to make recommendations to the Sponsor to continue vaccine dosing. The 
CEAC  will operate under the rules of an approved charter that will be wr itten and reviewed at 
the organizational meeting of the CEAC . Details regarding the CEAC  composition, 
responsibilities, procedures, and frequency of data review will be defined in its charter.  
MIS -C Case Definition  
Investigators will also be asked to repor t, as an AESI, clinical signs/symptoms consistent with 
the CDC case definition of MIS -C (CDC 2020d ): 
• An individual aged < 21 years presenting with fever, laboratory evidence of 
inflammation, and evidence of clinically severe illness requiring hospitalizati on, with 
multisystem (>  2) organ involvement (cardiac, renal, respiratory, hematologic, 
gastrointestinal, dermatologic, or neurological)  
AND

WITH OR WITHOUT  
• Positive for current or recent SARS -CoV -2 infection by RT -PCR, serology 
(non-S protein -based), or antigen test or COVID -19 exposure within the 4 weeks prior to 
the onset of symptoms:  
o Fever ≥  38.0°C/≥  100.4ºF for ≥  24 hours, or report of subjective fever lasting 
≥ 24 hours  
o Including, but not limited to, one or more of the following: an elevated C -reactive 
protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, fibrinogen, procalcitonin, d -dimer, 
ferritin, lactic acid dehydrogenase, or interleukin 6; elevated neutrophils; reduced 
lymphocytes; or low albumin  
Some participants may fulfil l full or partial criteria for Kawasaki disease but it should be 
reported if they meet the case definition for MIS -C. Consider MIS -C in any pediatric death with 
evidence of SARS -CoV -2 infection.  
7.4.6 Recording and Follow -up of Pregnancy  
Female participants who have a positive pregnancy test at Screening should not be enrolled; 
participants who have a positive pregnancy test any time during the study should receive no 
further dosing with IP but should be asked to remain in the study and be monitored for safety.  
Details of all pregnancies in female participants will be collected after the start of study 
treatment and until the end of their participation in the study.  
• If a pregnancy is reported, the investigator should inform the Sponsor within 24 hours of 
learning of the pregnancy and should follow the procedures outlined in this section.  
• Abnormal pregnancy outcomes (eg, spontaneous abortion, fetal death, stillbirth, 
congenital anomalies, ectopic pregnancy) are considered SAEs.  
Pregnancies occurring in participants after enrollment must be reported to the Sponsor or 
designee within 24 hours of the study site learning of its occurrence, using the SAE Mailbox, the 
SAE Hotline, or the SAE Fax line ( Section  7.4.11 ). If the participant agrees to submit this 
information, the pregnancy must be followed to determine the outcome, including spontaneous 
or voluntary termination, details of the birth, and the presence or a bsence of any birth defects, 
congenital abnormalities, or maternal and/or newborn complications. This follow -up should 
occur even if the intended duration of the safety follow -up for the study has ended. Pregnancy 
report forms will be distributed to the st udy site to be used for this purpose. The investigator 
ModernaTX, Inc.

Confidential  Page 124 must immediately (within 24  hours of awareness) report to the Sponsor any pregnancy resulting 
in an abnormal outcome according to the procedures described for SAEs.  
7.4.7 Eliciting and Documenting Adverse Ev ents 
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all A Es and SAEs are recorded in the eCRF and 
reported to the Sponsor.  
Solicited ARs will be collected from Day 1 through 7 days after each dose (ie, the day of 
injection and 6 subsequent days). Other (unsolicited) A Es will be collected from Day 1 through 
28 days after each dose.  
Both MAAEs and SAEs will be collected from participants as specified  in the SoAs 
(Section  10.1) until the end of their participation in the study. Any A Es that occur before 
administration of IP will be analyzed separately from A Es that occur after vaccine 
administration.  
At every study  site visit or telephone contact, participants or parent(s)/LAR(s) will be asked a 
standard question to elicit any medically related changes in the participant’s well -being 
(including COVID -19 symptoms). Participants or parent(s)/LAR(s) will also be asked if the 
participant has been hospitalized, had any accidents, used any new medications, changed 
concomitant medication regimens (both prescription and over -the-counter medications), or had 
any nonstudy vaccinations.  
In addition to participant observations, physical examination findings or data relevant to 
participant safety classified as an AE will be documented on the AE page of the eCRF.  
After the initial AE/SAE report, the investigator is required to proactively follow each participant 
at subsequent visit s/contacts. All A Es and SAEs will be treated as medically appropriate and 
followed until resolution, stabilization, the event is otherwise explained, or the participant is 
LTFU (as defined in Section  6.5). 
7.4.8 Assessment of Intensity  
An event is defined as “serious” when it meets at least one of the predefined outcomes as 
described in the definition of an SAE ( Section  7.4.2 ), NOT when it is rated as severe.  
The severity (or intensity) of an AR or AE refers to the extent to which it affects the participant’s 
daily activities. The Toxicity Grading Scale for Healthy Adult and Adolescent Volunteers 
Enrolled in Preventative Vaccine Clinical Trials ( DHHS 2007 ), modified for use in children 
37 months to < 12 years of age ( Table  8) and 6 months to ≤ 36 months of age ( Table 9), will be 
used to categorize local and systemic reactogenicity events ( solicited ARs) and body temperature 
ModernaTX, Inc.  
mRNA -1273 -P204 Protocol Amendment 9  mRNA -1273  
Confidential  Page 125 measurements observed during this study. Specific criteria for local and systemic rea ctogenicity 
events are presented in Section  7.4.3 . 
The determination of severity for all unsolicited A Es should be made by the investigator based 
upon medical judgment and the definitions of severity, as follows:  
• Mild: These events do not interfere with the participant’s daily activities.  
• Moderate: These events cause some interference with the participant’s daily activities and 
require limited or no  medical intervention.  
• Severe: These events prevent the participant’s daily activity and require intensive 
therapeutic intervention.  
Study staff should elicit from the participant or the parent(s)/LAR(s) the impact of AEs on the 
participant’s activities of daily living to assess severity and document it appropriately in the 
participant’s source documentation. Changes in the severity of an AE should be documented in 
the participant’s source documentation to allow an assessm ent of the duration of the event at 
each level of intensity to be performed. An AE characterized as intermittent requires 
documentation of onset and the duration of each episode. An AE that fluctuates in severity 
during the course of the event is reported once in the eCRF at the highest severity observed . 
7.4.9 Assessment of Causality  
The investigator’s assessment of an AE’s relationship to IP is part of the documentation process 
but is not a factor in determining what is or is not reported in the study.  
The inve stigator will assess causality (ie, whether there is a reasonable possibility that the IP 
caused the event) for all AEs and SAEs. The relationship will be characterized using the 
following classifications:  
Not related:  There is not a reasonable possibility  of a relationship to the IP. Participant did not 
receive the IP OR the temporal sequence of AE onset relative to administration of the IP is not 
reasonable OR the AE is more likely explained by a cause other than the IP.  
Related:  There is a reasonable pos sibility of a relationship to the IP. There is evidence of 
exposure to the IP. The temporal sequence of AE onset relative to the administration of the IP is 
reasonable. The AE is more likely explained by the IP than by another cause.  
7.4.10  Reporting Adverse Even ts 
The investigator is responsible for reporting all A Es that are observed or reported at the times 
specified in the SoAs ( Section  10.1), regardless of their relationship to IP or their clinical 
significance. If there is any doubt as to whether a clinical observation is an AE, the event should 
be reported.  
ModernaTX, Inc.  
mRNA -1273 -P204 Protocol Amendment 9  mRNA -1273  
Confidential  Page 126 All unsolicited AEs reported or observed during the study will be recorded on the AE page of the 
eCRF. Inf ormation to be collected includes type of event, time of onset, investigator -specified 
assessment of severity (impact on activities of daily living) and relationship to IP, time of 
resolution of the event, seriousness, any required treatments or evaluation s, and outcome. The 
unsolicited AEs resulting from concurrent illnesses, reactions to concurrent illnesses, reactions to 
concurrent medications, or progression of disease states must also be reported. All AEs will be 
followed until they are resolved or sta ble or judged by the investigator to be not clinically 
significant, including ongoing SAEs after study completion. The Medical Dictionary for 
Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) will be used to code all unsolicited AEs. 
Any medical condition that is present at the time that the participant is screened but does not 
deteriorate should not be reported as an unsolicited AE. However, if it deteriorates at any time 
during the study, it should be recorded as an unsolicited AE.  
7.4.11  Reporting SAEs  
Prompt notification by the investigator to the Sponsor of an SAE is essential so that legal 
obligations and ethical responsibilities towards the safety of participants and the safety of a study 
intervention under clinical investigation are met.  
Any AE considered serious by the inves tigator or that meets SAE criteria ( Section  7.4.2 ) must be 
reported to the Sponsor immediately (within 24  hours of becoming aware of the SAE) via the 
EDC system. The investigator will assess whether there is a reasonable possibility that the IP 
caused the SAE. The Sponsor will be responsible for notifying the relevant regulatory authorities 
of any SAE as outlined in the 21 US CFR Parts 312 and 320. The investigator is responsible for 
notifying the IRB directly.  
If the eCRF is unavailable at the time of the SAE, the following contact information is to be used 
for SAE reporting:  
• SAE Mailbox  : Safety_Moderna@iqvia.com  
• SAE Hotline (United States and Canada): +1 -866-599-1341  
• SAE Fax line (United States and Canada): +1 -866-599-1342  
Regulatory reporting requirements for SAEs are described in Section  7.4.15 . 
The investigator and any qualified designees are responsible for detecting, documenting, and 
recording events that meet the definition of an AE, including SAEs, and remain responsible for 
following up AEs that are serious, considered related to IP  or study procedures, or that caused 
the participant to discontinue the  study.

mRNA -1273 -P204 Protocol Amendment 9  mRNA -1273  
Confidential  Page 127 7.4.12  Time Period and Frequency for Collecting AE, AESI, and SAE Information  
Medical occurrences that begin before the start of IP dosing but after obtaining informed 
consent/assent will be recorded in the Medical History/Current Medical Conditions section of the 
eCRF and not in the AE section; however, if the condition worsens at any time during the study, 
it will be recorded and reported as an AE.  
Adverse events may be collected as follows:  
• Observing the participant  
• Receiving an unsolicited complaint from the participant or participant’s parent(s)/LAR(s)  
• Questioning the participant or participant’s parent(s)/LAR(s) in an unbiased and 
nonleading manner  
Solicited ARs will be collected from the day of injection through 6  days after each dose. Other 
(unsolicited) AEs will be collected from the day of injection through 28  days after each dose.  
Serious AEs (including AESIs) will be collected from the start of IP dosing un til the last day of 
study participation.  
All SAEs and AESIs will be recorded and reported to the Sponsor  or designee immediately and 
in all circumstances within 24  hours of becoming aware of the event via the EDC system. If a 
site receives a report of a ne w SAE or AESI from a study participant or receives updated data on 
a previously reported SAE or AESI and the eCRF has been taken offline, then the site can report 
this information on a paper SAE or AESI form using the SAE Mailbox, the SAE Hotline, or the 
SAE Fax line ( Section  7.4.11 ). 
An abnormal value or result from a clinical or laboratory evaluation can also indicate an AE if it 
is determined by the investigator to be clinically significant (eg, leads to dose modification or 
study drug discontinuation, or meets any serious criteria). If this is the case, it must be recorded 
in the source document and as an AE on the appropriate AE form(s). The evaluat ion that 
produced the value or result should be repeated until that value or result returns to normal or is 
stabilized and the participant’s safety is not at risk.  
Investigators are not obligated to actively seek AEs or SAEs after end of the study particip ation. 
However, if the investigator learns of any SAE (including a death) at any time after a participant 
has withdrawn from or completed the study, and the investigator considers the event to be 
reasonably related to the IP or study participation, the inv estigator must promptly notify the 
Sponsor.

mRNA -1273 -P204 Protocol Amendment 9  mRNA -1273  
Confidential  Page 128 7.4.13  Method of Detecting AEs and SAEs  
Electronic diaries have specifically been designed for this study by the Sponsor. The diaries will 
include prelisted AEs (solicited ARs) and intensity scales; they will also include blank space for 
the recording of information on other AEs (unsolicited AEs) and concomitant 
medications/vaccinations.  
The investigator is responsible for the documentation of AEs regardless of treatment group or 
suspected causal relationship to IP. For all AEs, the investigator must pursue and obtain 
information adequate to determine the outcome of the AE and to assess whether the AE meets 
the criteria for classification as an SAE requiring immediate notificati on to the Sponsor or its 
designated representative.  
Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting AEs and/or SAEs. Open -ended and 
nonleading verbal questioning of the participant and participant’s parent(s)/LAR(s) is the 
preferred method to inqui re about the occurrence of AE.  
7.4.14  Follow -up of AEs and SAEs  
After the initial AE/SAE report, the investigator is required to proactively follow each participant 
at subsequent visits and contacts.  
All AEs and SAEs will be treated as medically appropriate and f ollowed until resolution, 
stabilization, the event is otherwise explained, or the participant is LTFU, as defined in 
Section  6.5. 
7.4.15  Regulatory Reporting Requirements for SAEs  
• Prompt notification by the investigator to the Sponsor of an SAE is essential so that legal 
obligations and ethical responsibilities towards the safety of participants and the safety of 
a study intervention under clinical in vestigation are met.  
• The Sponsor has a legal responsibility to notify both the local regulatory authority and 
other regulatory agencies about the safety of a study intervention under clinical 
investigation. The Sponsor will comply with country -specific reg ulatory requirements 
relating to safety reporting to the regulatory authority, IRBs, and investigators.  
• Investigator safety reports must be prepared for suspected unexpected serious adverse 
reactions  according to local regulatory requirements and Sponsor p olicy and forwarded to 
investigators as necessary.  
• An investigator who receives an investigator safety report describing an SAE or other 
specific safety information (eg, summary or listing of SAEs) from the Sponsor will

to local requirements.  
7.5 Safety Monitoring  
The CRO’s medical monitor, the Sponsor’s medical monitor, and the individual study site 
investigators will monitor safety throughout the study . 
7.5.1 Internal Safet y Team  
An IST will review safety data throughout Part 1 of the study.  For Part 1 dose -escalation and age 
de-escalation, based on the review of all available safety data through at least Day 8 (1  week 
after Dose  1 of mRNA -1273) for at least 75 participants at each dose level within the 6 years to 
< 12 years and 2 years to < 6 years age group, the IST will recommend whether dose -escalation 
and age de -escalation are appropriate. This process will then be repeated for all participants in 
the 25 and 50 µg dose l evels within the lower age group of 6 months to < 2 years of age. An IST 
review of all available safety data through at least Day  36 (1  week after Dose 2 of mRNA -1273 
at each dose level) of at least 75 participants will be required prior to the administration of the 
second injection of the next higher dose. In addition, the IST will escalate any safety concerns to 
the DSMB. The frequency of IST meetings will be described in more detail in the IST charter.  
7.5.2 Data Safety Monitoring Board  
Safety overs ight will be under the direction of a DSMB composed of external independent 
consultants with relevant expertise. Members of the DSMB will be independent from study 
conduct and free of conflict of interest. The DSMB will meet at pre -specified timepoints dur ing 
the study to assess safety throughout study conduct. For the 6 years to < 12 years age group, the 
DSMB will review cumulative safety data for approximately 300 participants enrolled at the 
selected dose level in Part 1 before enrollment begins in Part 2. For both the middle age group 
(2 years to < 6 years) and the youngest age group (6 months to < 2 years) the DSMB will review 
cumulative safety data in both younger age groups (2 years to < 6 years; 6 months to < 2 years) 
combined and at all dose levels administered in Part  1 before start of Part 2 (blinded phase) for 
each age group. The DSMB will operate under the rules of an approved charter that will be 
written and reviewed at the organizational meeting of the DSMB. Details regarding the DSMB 
compositi on, responsibilities, procedures, and frequency of data review will be defined in its 
charter.  
If any of the study pause rules, described in Section  6.4, are met, the Sponsor will immediately 
suspend further enrollment and/or study dosing and the DSMB will convene on an ad hoc basis. 
The DSMB will review all available unblinded study data (as applicable) to help adjudicate any 
potential study pauses and make recommendations on further study conduct, including

Confidential  Page 130 requesting additional information, recommending stopping the study, recommending changes to 
study conduct and/or the protocol, or recommending additional operational considerations due to 
safety issues that arise during the study.  
The CEAC  consisting of pediatric and adult cardiologists will review suspected cases of 
myocarditis, pericarditis, or myopericarditis to determine if they meet CDC criteria of “probable” 
or “confirmed” event, and to asse ss severity and enable the DSMB to make recommendations to 
the Sponsor to continue vaccine dosing. The CEAC will operate under the rules of an approved 
charter that will be written and reviewed at the organizational meeting of the CEAC . Details 
regarding t he CEAC  composition, responsibilities, procedures, and frequency of data review will 
be defined in its charter.  
In Part 2 (blinded phase), the Sponsor medical monitor may escalate to the DSMB chair if any 
safety concerns are identified, as described in the  DSMB charter.  
7.6 Treatment of Overdose  
As the study treatment is to be administered by a healthcare professional, it is unlikely that an 
overdose will occur. Dose deviations will be tracked as protocol deviations ( Section  10.2.8 ). 
7.7 Pharmacokinetics  
Pharmacokinetic parameters will not be evaluated in this study.  
7.8 Pharmacodynamics  
Pharmacodynamic parameters will not be evaluated in this study.  
7.9 Biomarkers  
Immunogenicity assessments are presented in Section  7.2. Biomarkers will not be evaluated in 
this study.

Confidential  Page 131 8 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  PLAN  
This section summarizes the planned statistical analysis strategy and procedures for the study. 
The details of statistical analysis will be provided in the statistical analysis plan (SAP), which 
will be finalized before the clinical database lock for the study. If changes are made to primary 
and/or key secondary objectives and hypotheses or the statistical methods related to those 
hypotheses after the study has begun but prior to any data unblinding, t hen the protocol will be 
amended (consistent with ICH Guideline E9). Changes to other secondary or exploratory 
analyses made after the protocol has been finalized, along with an explanation as to when and 
why they occurred, will be listed in the SAP or cli nical study report (CSR) for the study. Ad hoc 
exploratory analyses, if any, will be clearly identified in the CSR.  
8.1 Blinding and Responsibility for Analyses  
Part 1 of this study will be open -label, blinding procedures will not be applicable.  
Part 2 of this  study will be conducted in an observer -blind manner. The investigator, study staff, 
study participants, study site monitors, and Sponsor personnel (or its designees) will be blinded 
to the IP administered until study end, with the following exceptions:  
• Unblinded pharmacy personnel (of limited number) will be assigned to vaccine 
accountability procedures and will prepare and administer mRNA -1273 (or placebo) to 
all participants. These pharmacy personnel will have no study functions other than study 
vaccine management, documentation, accountability, preparation, and administration. 
They will not be involved in participant evaluations and will not reveal the identity of IP 
to either the participant or the blinded study site personnel involved in the conduct of  the 
study unless this information is necessary in the case of an emergency.  
• Unblinded study site monitors, not involved in other aspects of monitoring, will be 
assigned as the IP accountability monitors. They will have responsibilities to ensure that 
study sites are following all proper IP accountability, preparation, and administration 
procedures.  
• An unblinded statistical and programming team will perform the primary analyses in 
Part 2 (Section  8.6.2 ). Sponsor team members will be pre -specified to be unblinded to the 
primary analysis results and will not communicate the results of primary analysis to the 
blinded investigators, study site staff, clinic al monitors, or participants.  
The dosing assignment will be concealed by having the unblinded pharmacy personnel prepare 
the IP in a secure location that is not accessible or visible to other study staff. An opaque sleeve 
over the syringe used for injectio n will maintain the blind at the time of injection, as the doses 
containing mRNA -1273 will look different from those of placebo. Only delegated unblinded 
ModernaTX, Inc.  
mRNA -1273 -P204 Protocol Amendment 9  mRNA -1273  
Confidential  Page 132 study site staff will conduct the injection procedure. Once the injection is completed, only the 
blind ed study staff will perform further assessments and interact with the participants. Access to 
the randomization code will be strictly controlled at the pharmacy.  
Part 3 is open label; however, if blinded administration is ongoing at the site, blinded proce dure 
for Part 2 still applies.  
Blinded staff will be allowed to transport and administer vaccines  if the site is no longer 
enrolling blinded participants in the study and if  no second doses are pending for curre nt blinded 
participants. This does not change  the requirement for dose preparation by unblinded pharmacy 
staff.  
The planned study analyses are described in Section  8.6. 
8.1.1 Breaking the Blind  
A pa rticipant’s treatment assignment may be unblinded (Part 2 of the study) in the event of an 
SAE or other severe event, or if there is a medical emergency requiring the identity of the 
product to be known to properly treat a participant. If a participant bec omes seriously ill or 
pregnant during the study, the blind will be broken if knowledge of the administered vaccine will 
affect that participant’s dosing options. In the event of a medical emergency requiring 
identification of the vaccine administered to an  individual participant, the investigator will make 
every attempt to contact the Sponsor medical lead to explain the need for opening the code 
within 24  hours of opening the code. The investigator will be responsible for documenting the 
time, date, reason for the code break, and the names of the personnel involved. If a COVID -19 
vaccine is authorized or licensed for a specific age group before the end of the study, please refer 
to Section 3.3 for unblinding and/or cross -over plans.  
Participants under 6 years of age in Part 2 who have reached at least 6 months follow  up after 
Dose 2 will be eligible for unblinding via a telephone ca ll to learn which treatment they received. 
Participants  who received p lacebo will be offered the option of cross -over vaccination with 
mRNA -1273 at that point . 
In addition to the aforementioned situations where the blind may be broken, the data will also b e 
unblinded to a statistical team at specified time points for interim analyses as outlined in 
Section  8.6.1 . 
Unblinding of still blinded participant s based only on parental/LAR request and not related to a 
safety event or health concern before  reaching at least 6 months follow up after Dose 2 will not 
be permitted to protect the data integrity of the blinded portion of the study. If a parent/LAR 
wishes to withdraw their child from the study, they may withdraw at any time but will only be 
able to learn the treatment group assignment once their c hild has reached at least 6 months of 
ModernaTX, Inc.

Confidential  Page 133 follow -up after Dose 2 or an unblinding trigger for the entire applicable age group is reached (eg , 
EUA granted for mRNA -1273 or a competitor vaccine . Participants who turn 5  years old will be  
eligible for unblinding a nd cross -over as of their 5th birthday given the availability of an 
authorized COVI D-19 vaccine for  5-year-old children  outside of  the study  since October 29, 
2021 . 
8.2 Statistical Hypothesis  
If an accepted antibody threshold of protection against COVID -19 is established for the primary 
immunogenicity endpoint, the null hypothesis is that the percentage of participants on 
mRNA -1273 with serum antibody above the established threshold at Day  57 is ≤  70% 
(ie, H0: percentage of participants on mRNA -1273 with serum antibody at Day  57 above the 
established threshold ≤  70%).  
For each age group, the study will be considered to meet the immunogenicity endpoint if the 
95% confidence interval (CI) of percentage of participants on mRNA -1273 rules out 70% (lower 
bound of the  95% CI is >  70%).  
The null hypotheses may be updated when the information on an acceptable antibody threshold 
becomes available. In this case, the null hypothesis update will be provided in the SAP.  
If an accepted serum antibody threshold of protection ag ainst COVID -19 is not available for the 
primary immunogenicity endpoint, immune response as measured by GM value and SRR  in each 
age group based on Day 57 antibody levels will be compared with Day 57 antibody levels from 
young adults (18 to 25 years of age) in Study P301. Noninferiority tests of 2 null hypotheses 
based on 2 coprimary endpoints will be performed, respectively.  
Part 1 or 2 Hypothesis Testing for Primary Series in Each Age Group  
Coprimary endpoint 1: antibody GM value at Day 57  
The null hyp othesis H10: immunogenicity response to mRNA -1273, as measured by antibody 
GM value at Day 57, is inferior in children (in age groups 6 months to < 2 years, 2 years to 
< 6 years, and 6 years to < 12 years) compared with that in young adults (18 to 25  years  of age) 
using mRNA -1273 Study  P301 data.  
The noninferiority in antibody GM value in an age group in children compared with that in 
young adults (18 to 25 years of age) is demonstrated by meeting both success criteria:  
- The lower bound of the 95%  CI of the geometric mean ratio (GMR) ruling out 0.67 
(lower bound ≥ 0.67) using a noninferiority margin of 1.5, AND  
- The GMR point estimate ≥ 0.8 (minimum threshold).  
ModernaTX, Inc.  
mRNA -1273 -P204 Protocol Amendment 9  mRNA -1273  
Confidential  Page 134 The GMR is the ratio of the GM value of SARS -CoV -2-specific antibody in children in an 
age group receiving mRNA -1273 in this Study P204 compared with the GM value of young 
adults (18 to 25 years of age) receiving mRNA -1273 in Study P301 at Day 57.  
Coprimary endpoint 2: antibody seroresponse rate at Day 57  
A definition of seroresponse will be provided in the SAP based on forthcoming information 
about assay performance.  
The null hypothesis H20: immunogenicity response to mRNA -1273 as measured by SRR  at Day 
57 is inferior in children compared with that in young adults (18 to 25 years of age) in 
Study  P301 . 
The noninferiority in SRR  in an age group in children compared with that in young adults (18 to 
25 years of age) is demonstrated by meeting both success criteria:  
- The lower bound of the 95% CI of the SRR  difference ruling out -10% (ie, lower bound 
≥ -10%) using the noninferiority margin of 10%, AND  
- The SRR  difference point estimate ≥ -5% (minimum threshold)  
The SRR  difference is defined as the SRR  in children receiving mRNA -1273 minus the SRR  
in young adults of 18 to 25 years of age receiving mRNA -1273 from Study P301.  
The study would be considered to meet the primary immunogenicity endpoint in an age group if 
the noninferiority in the age group compared with the young adults (18 to 25 years of age) is 
demonstrated based on both coprimary endpoints.  
Part 1 or Part 2 Hypothesis Testing for mRNA -1273 Booster Dose  
Booster dose coprimary endpoint 1: antibody GM at BD -Day 29  
The null hypothesis H10: immunogenicity response to mRNA -1273 booster dose as measured by 
Ab GM at BD -Day 29 in children in Study P204 is inferior compared with Ab GM that at Day 
57 (28 days after Dose 2) in the primary series of mRNA -1273 in adults (18  to 25  years of age) 
in Study P301.  
The noninferiority in Ab GM at BD -Day 29 in children receiving mRNA -1273 as a booster dose 
in Study P204 compared with Ab GM at Day 57 in the primary series in adults (18  to 25  years of 
age) in Study P301 will be demonstrated by the GMR 95% CI lo wer bound ≥ 0.67 using a 
noninferiority margin of 1.5. The GMR is defined as the ratio of GM value of Ab at BD -Day 29 
in Study P204 compared with Ab GM val ue at Day 57 (28 days after Dose  2) following the 
primary series of  mRNA -1273 in Study  P301.

Confidential  Page 135 Booster dose coprimary endpoint 2: antibody seroresponse rate  at BD -Day 29  
The null hypothesis H20: immunogenicity response to mRNA -1273 booster dose as measured by 
SRR at BD -Day 29 in children in Study P204 is inferior compared with SRR at Day 57 (28 days 
after Dose 2) following the primary series of mRNA -1273 in adults (18  to 25 years of age)  in 
Study P301.  
The noninferiority in SRR at BD -Day 29 in children receiving mRNA -1273 as a booster dose in 
Study P204 compared with SRR at Day 57 (28 days after Dose  2) following the primary series of 
mRNA -1273 will be demonstrated by the SRR 95% CI lower bound ≥  -10% using the 
noninferiority margin of 10%. The SRR difference is defined as the SRR at BD -Day 29 in Study 
P204 minus the rate at Day 57 (28 days after Dose  2) following the primary series of 
mRNA -1273 in adults in Study P301. The SRR is defined as a titer change from baseline (pre -
Dose 1) below the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) to ≥ 4 × LLOQ, or at least a 4 -fold rise 
if baseline is ≥ LLOQ.  
Booster do se primary immunogenicity objective for a n age group in Part 2 will be considered to 
be met if the noninferiority in the age group compared with the adults ( 18 to 25 years  of age ) is 
demonstrated based on both coprimary endpoints.  
Part 3 Hypothesis Testing for Primary Series  
Primary series coprimary endpoint 1: antibody GM value at Day 57  
The null hypothesis H10: immunogenicity response to mRNA -1273, as measured by antibody 
GM value at Day 57, is inferior in children compared with that in adults (≥  18 years of age) using 
mRNA -1273 Study P301 data.  
The noninferiority in antibody GM value in children in Part 3 compared with that in adults 
(≥ 18 years of age) is demonstrated by meeting the following success criterion:  
• The lower bound of the (1-alpha)  CI of the GMR ruling out 0. 67 (lower bound ≥ 0.67) 
using a noninferiority margin of 1.5. 
The 1 -alpha can be 97.5% or 95% depending on the alpha level of 0.025 or 0.05 used for the 
hypothesis testing. The GMR is the ratio of the GM value of SARS -CoV -2-specific antibody in 
children receiving mRNA -1273 in this Study P204 compared with the GM value of adults 
(≥ 18 years of age) receiving mRNA -1273 in Study P301 at Day 57.

Confidential  Page 136 The noninferiority in SRR  in children receiving mRNA -1273 in Part 3 compared with that  in 
adults (≥  18 years of age) is demonstrated by meeting the following success criterion:  
• The lower bound of the (1-alpha) CI of the SRR  difference ruling out -10% (ie, lower 
bound ≥ -10%) using the noninferiority margin of 10% . 
The 1 -alpha can be 97.5% o r 95% depending on the alpha level of 0.025 or 0.05 used for the 
hypothesis testing. The SRR  difference is defined as the SRR  in children receiving mRNA -1273 
minus the SRR  in adults of ≥  18 years of age receiving mRNA -1273 from Study P301.  
Part 3 primary series  primary immunogenicity objective will be considered to be met  if the 
noninferiority in children  compared with the adults (≥  18 years of age) is demonstrated based on 
both coprimary endpoints.  
Part 3 Hypothesis Testing for Third Dose  
Third dose coprimary endpoint 1: antibody GM at BD -Day 29  
The null hypothesis H10: immunogenicity response to mRNA -1273 third dose as measured by Ab 
GM at BD -Day 29 in children in Study P204 is inferior compared with Ab GM that at Day  57 
(28 days after Dose 2) in the primary series of mRNA -1273 in adults ( ≥ 18 years of age) in Study 
P301 . 
The noninferiority in Ab GM at BD -Day 29 in children re ceiving mRNA -1273 as a third dose in 
Study P204 compared with Ab GM at Day 57 in the primary series in adults ( ≥ 18 years  of age ) 
in Study P301 will be demonstrated by the GMR (1-alpha) CI lower bound ≥ 0.67 using a 
noninferiority margin of 1.5 , where the 1 -alpha can be 97.5% or 95% depending on the alpha 
level of 0.025 or 0.05 used for the hypothesis testing . The GMR is defined as the ratio of GM 
value of Ab at BD -Day 29 in Study P204 compared with Ab GM value at Day 57 (28  days after 
Dose  2) following the primary series of mRNA -1273  in Study  P301.  
Third dose coprimary endpoint 2: antibody seroresponse rate  at BD -Day 29  
The null hypothesis H20: immunogenicity response to mRNA -1273 third dose as measured by 
SRR at BD -Day 29 in children in Study P204 is inferior compared with SRR at Day 57 (28 days 
after Dose 2) following the primary series of mRNA -1273 in adul ts (≥ 18 years of age) in Study 
P301.

noninferiority margin of 10% , where the 1 -alpha can be 97.5% or 95% depending on the alpha 
level of 0.025 or 0.05 used for the hypothesis testing . The SRR difference is defined as th e SRR 
at BD -Day 29 in Study P204 minus the rate at Day 57 (28 days after Dose  2) following the

Confidential  Page 137 primary series of mRNA -1273  in adults in Study P301. The SRR is defined as a titer change 
from baseline (pre -Dose 1) below the LLOQ  to ≥ 4 × LLOQ, or at least a 4-fold rise if baseline is 
≥ LLOQ.  
Part 3 third dose primary immunogenicity objective will be considered to be met if the 
noninferiority in the age group compared with the  adults ( ≥ 18 years of age) is demonstrated 
based on both coprimary endpoints.  
Justif ication of using  Immunogenicity Subset  of adults (≥  18 years of age) from  Study  P301 as a 
comparator for hypothesis testing  
In Phase 3 pivotal Study P301  with more than 30,000 participants enrolled , VE against  
symptomatic COVID -19 based on adjudi cation committee assessment starting 14 days after 
second injection in the PP Set was demonstrated with VE estimate of 93.2% (95% CI: 91.0, 94.8)  
in adults ≥ 18 years in the final efficacy analysis  (04 May 2021  database lock ) in the blinded 
phase . In a random s ample stratified by baseline SARS -CoV -2 status  (negative vs. positive) , age 
group ( < 65 vs . ≥ 65 years) and race/ethnicity (minority vs. non -minority) , there were  n=1055  
participants ≥ 18 years  of age  in the PP Immunogenicity Subset  who received mRNA -1273 
100 µg with baseline negative SARS -CoV -2 status . The observed pseudovirus neutralizing 
antibody ( PsVNA ) ID50 GMT at Day 57 was 1081.1 (9 5% CI:  1019.8, 1146.1)  for adults 
≥ 18 years  in Study  P301 . 
A separate random subset of young adults 18 to 25 years of age  from Study P301  (n=305 in the 
PP Immunogenicity Subset receiving mRNA -1273 100 µg,  of which  n=296 have  PsVNA assay 
results reported at Day 57)  was selected for the purpose of immunobrid ging adolescents in Study 
P203 and children in Study P204 to young adults in Study P301. This subset of young adults 
with observed PsVNA ID50 GMT of 1301 .3 (95% CI: 1172 .3, 1444 .5) at Day 57  was planned 
and used as a comparator in the primary immunogenicity analysis testing the noninferiority of 
immunogenicity in adolescents in Study P203 and children in Study P204.  
The observed Day 57  GMT of 1301.3 in young  adults 18 to 25 years is approximately 1.2-fold 
higher compared with 1081.1  in adults ≥  18 years  of age with high VE established  (VE estimate 
of 93.2% [95% CI: 91.0, 94.8]) . The data  suggest that adults  ≥ 18 years of age  may also be 
considered as a reference  for immu nobridging analyses. 
If a comparator age group of adults ≥  18 years from Study P301 is used in a primary 
immunogenicity noninferiority hypothesis testing for children in Study P204, a sensitivity 
analysis may be performed by using different age group(s) (eg, 18 to 25 years, ≥  65 years) from 
Study  P301 as a comparator.

The initial age groups in Part 1 are for estimation purposes. With approximately 750 participants 
(approximately 375 participants at each dose level of mRNA -1273) in the initial 6 years to 
< 12 years age group, there is at least a 90% probability t o observe at least 1 participant with an 
AE at a true AE rate of 1% for a given dose level. In each of the younger age groups ( 2 years to 
< 6 years and 6  months to < 2 years), the safety assessment will occur during the conduct of 
Part 2 after approximatel y 375 participants have been exposed to mRNA -1273 at the dose level 
selected for Part 2. For further details, please refer to Section 7.5.2 . 
The sample size in the expansion (Part 2) is considered to be sufficient to support a safety 
database in the pediatric participants 6 months to < 12 years of age. With up to 3,000  participants 
each in the 6 years to < 12 years, 2 years to < 6 years, and 6 months to < 2 years of age groups 
exposed to mRNA -1273 at a given dose level in Part 2, the study has at least a 95% probability 
to observe at least 1 participant with an AE at a true 0.1% AE rate for a given dose level.  
The sample size in the lower  dosing assessment (Part 3) is approximately 300 children 6 years to 
< 12 years of age receiving mRNA -1273  25 µg. There is at least a 90% probability to observe at 
least 1 participant with an AE at a true AE rate of 1% in this group.  
A subset of Full Analy sis Set (FAS) participants (Immunogenicity Subset) in each age group  will 
be selected for measuring immunogenicity data. The immunogenicity samples of the 
Immunogenicity Subset will be processed, and the analysis of primary immunogenicity endpoint 
will be based on the PP Immunogenicity Subset.  
If a threshold of protection is available, for the primary immunogenicity endpoint, with 
approximately 289 participants on mRNA -1273 in the PP Immunogenicity Subset of an age 
group , there will be at least 90% power to  rule out 70% with a 2 -sided 95% CI (lower bound of 
the 95%  CI > 70%) for the percentage of mRNA -1273 participants exceeding the accepted 
threshold if the true rate of participants exceeding the threshold is 80%.  
If an acceptable antibody threshold of prot ection against COVID -19 is not available at the time 
of analysis for the primary immunogenicity endpoint, noninferiority tests of the 2 null 
hypotheses based on the 2 coprimary endpoints will be performed, respectively. The sample size 
calculation for each  of the 2 noninferiority tests was performed, and the larger sample size was 
chosen for the study.

unless specified otherwise. The primary objective of this study is to use the immunogenicity 
response to infer efficacy in participants aged 6 months to < 12 years at the dose level selected 
for expansion. For this objective, analyses of immunogenicity will be performed for each 
pediatric age group separately at the selected dose level based on the participants in the PP 
Immunogenicity Subset. For each pediatric age group, participants in the applicable study part  in 
the PP Immunogenicity Subset may be used for immunogenicity primary analysis. Participants

mRNA -1273 -P204 Protocol Amendment 9  mRNA -1273  
Confidential  Page 144 from Part 1 and Part 2 who receive the same mRNA -1273 dose level selected for expansion may 
be combined for immunogenicity analyses. If the same dose level is selected for expansion for 
more than one age group, these age groups may b e combined for immunogenicity analyses.  
An accepted antibody threshold of protection against COVID -19 may be available based on data 
from other mRNA -1273 studies or external data. If such a threshold of protection against 
COVID -19 is available, the number and percentage of participants with antibody greater than or 
equal to the threshold at Day  57 will be provided with a 2 -sided 95% CI using the 
Clopper -Pearson method. For an age group, if the lower bound of the 95% CI on the 
mRNA -1273 group is > 70%, the p rimary immunogenicity endpoint of this study will be 
considered to be met for that age group.  
The number and percentage of participants with serum antibody greater than or equal to the 
threshold with 2 -sided 95% CI will be provided at each postbaseline tim e point. The CI will be 
calculated using the Clopper -Pearson method.  
If an accepted serum antibody threshold of protection against COVID -19 is not established, 
immune response as measured by GM value and SRR  in each age group based on Day  57 
antibody level s will be compared with that in young adults (18 to 25 years of age) using data 
from Study P301. An analysis of covariance model will be carried out with antibody at Day  57 as 
dependent variable and a group variable (a pediatric age group in Study  P204 ver sus young 
adults [18 to 25 years of age] in Study P301) as the fixed variable for each pediatric age group. 
The GM values of the pediatric age group at Day 57 will be estimated by the geometric least 
square mean (GLSM) from the model. The GMR (ratio of GM values) will be estimated by the 
ratio of GLSM from the model. The corresponding 2 -sided 95% CI will be provided to assess the 
difference in immune response between the pediatric age group (Study  P204) compared with the 
young adults (18 to 25 years of age)  in Study P301 at Day 57. For each pediatric age group, the 
noninferiority of GM value will be considered demonstrated if:  
- The lower bound of the 95% CI of the GMR is ≥ 0.67 based on the noninferiority margin 
of 1.5, AND  
- The GMR point estimate > 0.8 (minim um threshold).  
For Part 1 or  Part 2 booster dose primary immunogenicity analysis of GM in children receiving 
mRNA -1273 booster dose , an analysis of covariance model will be performed to assess the 
difference in  the immune response (Ab level) between  BD-Day 29 in children receiving mRNA -
1273 booster dose (third dose) in Study P204  and Day 57 in young adults (≥18 -25 years of age) 
receiving mRNA -1273 primary series  in Study P301 . In the analysis of covariance model, 
antibody titers at BD-Day 29 in P204 children and titers at Day 57 in P301 young adults will be a 
dependent  variable, and a group variable (children in Study P204  and young adults in Study 
ModernaTX, Inc.  
mRNA -1273 -P204 Protocol Amendment 9  mRNA -1273  
Confidential  Page 145 P301 ) will be the fixed effect . The GMT will be estimated by the GLSM from the model , and its 
correspond ing 95% CI will be provided for each group. The GMR (ratio of GMTs) for children

GLSM from the model , and the corresponding 95% CIs will be provided. The 95% CI for GMR 
will be used to assess the between -group difference in immune response at BD -Day 29 in 
children in Study P204  compared with Day 57 after the primary vaccine series in young adults in  
Study  P301. The noninferiority of post -booster GM in children will be  considered demonstrated 
if the lower bound of the 95% CI of the GMR is ≥  0.67 based on the noninferiority margin of 
1.5. 
For Part 3 primary series primary immunogenicity analysis of GM in children 6 years to 
< 12 years of age receiving mRNA -1273 25 µg whi ch is half of the 50 µg dose level used in 
Part 2 for the same age group, the noninferiority hypothesis testing of GM in children compared 
with adults ≥  18 years of age from Study P301 will be performed using an analysis of covariance 
model as described ab ove. The noninferiority of GM in children in Part 3 will be considered 
demonstrated if the lower bound of the (1-alpha)  CI of the GMR is ≥ 0.67 based on the 
noninferiority margin of 1.5, where the 1 -alpha can be 97.5% or 95% depending on the alpha 
level of  0.025 or 0.05 used for the hypothesis testing . A sensitivity analysis may be conducted by 
using different age group(s) (eg, 18 to 25 years, ≥  65 years) from Study  P301 as a comparator.  
For Part 3 third dose primary immunogenicity an alysis of GM in children receiving  a third  
mRNA -1273 dose, an analysis of covariance model will be performed to assess the difference in 
the immune response at BD -Day 29 between children receiving mRNA -1273 third dose in  Study  
P204 and adults (≥18 years  of age ) receiving mRNA -1273 booster dose (third dose) in Study  
P301. In the analysis of covariance model, antibody titers at BD -Day 29 in P204 children and 
titers at Day 57 in P301 young adults will be a dependent variable, and a group variable (children 
in Study  P204 and a dults in Study  P301) will be the fixed effect . The GMT will be estimated by 
the GLSM from the model and its corresponding 95% will be provided for each group. The 
GMR for children in Study  P204 with respect to adults in Study  P301 will be estimated by the 
ratio of GLSM from the model and the corresponding 95% CIs will be provided. The 95% CI for 
GMR will be used to assess the between -group difference in immune response at BD -Day 29 in 
children in Study  P204 compared with Day 57 following the primary vaccine series in adults in 
Study  P301.  The noninferiority of post -third dose  GM in children will be considered 
demonstrated if the lower bound of the (1-alpha)  CI of the GMR is ≥ 0.67 based on the 
noninferiority margin of 1.5.  
The number and percentage of  participants with seroresponse due to vaccination will be provided 
with 2 -sided 95% CI using the Clopper -Pearson method at each post baseline  time point with 
Day 57 being of the primary interest  in the analyses for the mRNA -1273 primary series in Part  1

will be provided between children receiving mRNA -1273  primary series  in Study P204 Part 1  or 
Part 2 and young adults of 18 to 25  years of age receiving mRNA -1273 prim ary series in Study 
P301 . For each pediatric age group  in Part 1 or Part 2 , the noninferiority of SRR  will be 
considered demonstrated if:  
- The lower bound of the 95% CI of the SRR  difference is ≥ -10% based on the 
noninferiority margin of 10%, AND  
- The SRR  difference point estimate ≥ -5% (minimum threshold).  
For Part 1 or  Part 2 booster dose primary immunogenicity analysis of seroresponse in children 
receiving mRNA -1273 booster dose  (as applicable) , the SRR with 95% CI (using Clopper -
Pearson method) will be  summarized. The SRR difference with 95% CI (using Miettinen -
Nurminen score method) to compare post -booster SRR at BD -Day 29 in children in Study P204 
with the primary series SRR at Day 57 (28 days after Dose 2)  in adults (18 to 25 years  of age ) in 
Study P 301 will be computed. The SRR is defined as a titer change from baseline (pre -Dose 1) 
below the LLOQ to ≥  4 × LLOQ, or at least a 4 -fold rise if baseline is ≥ LLOQ. The 
noninferiority of SRR in children receiving mRNA -1273 booster dose will be considered 
demonstrated if the lower bound of the 95% CI of the SRR difference is ≥ -10% based on the 
noninferiority margin of 10%.  
For Part 3 primary series primary immunogenicity analysis of seroresponse in children 6 to 
< 12 years of age receiving mRNA -1273 25 µg w hich is half of the 50 µg dose level used in 
Part 2 for the same age group, the noninferiority hypothesis testing of SRR in children compared 
with adults ≥ 18 years of age from Study P301 will be performed using the analysis of SRR as 
described above. The SRR  difference with (1-alpha)  CI at Day 57 will be provided between 
children receiving mRNA -1273 primary series in Study P204 Part 3 and adults of ≥ 18 years of 
age receiving mRNA -1273 primary series in Study P301. The 1 -alpha can be 97.5% or 95% 
depending  on the alpha level of 0.025 or 0.05 used for the hypothesis testing. The noninferiority 
of SRR in children receiving mRNA -1273 25 µg primary series in Part 3 will be considered 
demonstrated if the lower bound of the (1-alpha)  CI of the SRR difference is ≥  -10% based on 
the noninferiority margin of 10%. A sensitivity analysis may be conducted by using different age 
group(s) (eg, 18 to 25 years, ≥  65 years) from Study P301 as a comparator.  
For Part 3 third dose  primary immunogenicity an alysis of seroresponse  in children receiving  a

Dose 1) below the LLOQ to ≥  4 × LLOQ, or at least a 4 -fold rise if baseline is ≥ LLOQ.  The 
noninferiority of SRR in children receiving  a third dose of  mRNA -1273 in Part 3 will be 
considered demonst rated if the lower bound of the (1-alpha)  CI of the SRR difference is ≥ -10% 
based on the noninferiority margin of 10%.  
In addition, the GM value of anti -SARS -CoV -2-specific antibody with corresponding 95% CI 
will be provided at each time point. The 95% C Is will be calculated based on the t -distribution of 
the log -transformed values then back transformed to the original scale. For each age group , the 
geometric mean fold‑ rise (GMFR)  of specific nAb and bAb with corresponding 95%  CI at each 
postbaseline time point over preinjection baseline at Day 1 and an earlier time point if applicable 
will be provided. Descriptive summary statistics including median, minimum, and maximum will 
also be provided.  
Multiplicity Adjustment Between Age Groups:  
A hierarchical  sequential hypothesis testing (fixed -sequence method) will be used to adjust 
multiplicity to preserve the family -wise Type I error rate (alpha = 0.05), starting with the oldest 
age group, followed by the middle age group, and then followed by the youngest  age group. The 
primary series  immunogenicity coprimary endpoint hypotheses for the oldest age group ( 6 years 
to < 12 years of age) will be tested first at alpha level of 0.05  in Part 1 expansion  or Part 2 . If the 
testing in the oldest age group is statist ically significant (meeting the noninferiority success 
criteria of the coprimary endpoints), the alpha level of 0.05 will be passed to the testing of the 
primary series coprimary endpoint hypotheses in the middle age group ( 2 years to < 6 years of 
age) in Part 2 . If the testing in the middle age group is statistically significant at alpha level of 
0.05, then the alpha 0.05 is preserved for testing the primary series coprimary endpoint 
hypotheses in the youngest age group (6  months to < 2 years of age)  in Pa rt 2. 
If the  hypothesis  testing is statistically significant for all the primary series primary 
immunogenicity endpo ints in Part 2, the alpha 0.05 is preserved for the hypothesis testing for the 
booste r dose primary immunogenicity endpo int in Part 1 or Part 2, starting in the oldest age 
group ( 6 years to < 12 years of age), then the middle age group ( 2 years to < 6 years of age), 
followed by the youngest age group (6  months to < 2 years of age) for booster dose in applicable 
age groups in Part 1 or Part 2. The testing will continue through the sequence only until an 
endpoint is not statistically significant (did not meet specified noninferiority success criteria of 
any primary endpoint) in Part 1 or Part 2, in which case the testing will stop.  If the hypo thesis 
testing for all the boost er dose primary endpoints in Part 2 is statistically significant (meeting the 
noninferiority success criteria of the primary endpoints), the alpha level of 0.05 will be passed to 
the hypothesis testing in Part 3. 
ModernaTX, Inc.  
mRNA -1273 -P204 Protocol Amendment 9  mRNA -1273  
Confidential  Page 148 In Part 3, half of the type I error rate 0.05 by alpha -splitting will be initially allocated to the 
hypothesis testing for the primary series immunogenicity coprimary endpoints, which will be 
tested initially at alpha level of 0.025. The second 0.025 will be reserved  for Part 3 third  dose 
hypothesis testing, and a fallback method will be used if applicable.  
• If the testing of the primary series coprimary endpoints in Part 3 is statistically significant at 
alpha level of 0.025 (meeting the noninferiority success criteria of the coprimary endpoints), 
a total of alpha 0.05 will be preserved for the hypothesis testing of the Part 3 third  dose 
immunogenicity coprimary endpoints.  
• If the hypothesis testing of the primary series coprimary endpoints in Part 3 is not statistically 
significant at alpha level of 0.025 (not meeting any of the specific noninferiority success 
criteria of the coprimary endpoints), the remaining alpha level o f 0.025 reserved will be used 
for the hypothesis testing of the Part 3 third  dose immunogenicity coprimary endpoints. 
Further, if the hypothesis testing of the third  dose coprimary endpoints in Part 3 is 
statistically significant at alpha level of 0.025, t he unused alpha 0.025 will be passed back to 
re-testing of primary series coprimary endpoint hypothesis in Part 3 at alpha level of 
0.025+0.025=0.05 (a fallback method).  
8.5.4 Efficacy Analysis  
To evaluate the incidence of COVID -19 after vaccination with mRNA -1273 or placebo, the 
incidence rate will be provided by vaccination group, dose level, and age group , calculated as the 
number of cases divided by the total person -time. Participants in Part  1 and Part 2 of the study 
and in different age group s who receive the same mRNA -1273 dose level (if applicable) may be 
combined in the analysis.  
For serologically confirmed SARS -CoV -2 infection or COVID -19, regardless of 
symptomatology or severity, infect ion rate will be provided by vaccination group, dose level, and 
age group. The same analysis will be conducted for asymptomatic SARS -CoV -2 infection.  
The secondary efficacy analyses will be performed on the PP Set, with sensitivity analyses in 
FAS, modifie d Intent -to-Treat ( mITT ) Set, and modified Intent -to-Treat -1 (mITT1 ) Set. 
Analyses of the efficacy endpoints in Part 2 will be performed for the randomized blinded phase. 
Additional e xploratory analyses will be conducted in the blinded and unblinded phases  for 
participants randomized to mRNA -1273 in Part 2, and in the unblinded phase for participants 
who are originally randomized to the placebo arm and cross -over to mRNA -1273 after use of 
any COVID -19 vaccine is authorized  or licensed for the participant’s age group .

Subgroup analyses will be performed as described in the SAP.  
8.6 Study Analyses  
8.6.1 Interim Analyses  
Part 1: Interim analyses may be performed  after all or a subset of participants (with 
immunogenicity samples collected for D1 and D57) have completed Day  57 within an age group 
in Part 1 (one optional interim analysis for each age group, 3 interim analyses total for the 3  age 
groups in Part 1). A nalyses of safety and immunogenicity may be conducted at each interim 
analysis.  
Part 2: An interim analysis of immunogenicity and safety will be performed after all or a subset 
of participants have completed Day 57 (1 month after the second dose) in Part 1 or Part 2 within 
an age group. This interim analysis will be considered the primary analysis of immunogenicity 
for a given age group. Another interim analysis on safety may be performed after a different 
subset or all participants have completed Day 57 in  an age group . Additional  interim analys is of 
immunogenicity and safety may be performed after all or subset of participants who receive 
booster dose have completed BD -Day 29 after the booster dose in an age group.  
Part 3: An interim analysis of immunogeni city and safety will be performed after all or a subset 
of participants have completed Day 57 (1 month after the second dose) in Part 3 within an age 
group. This interim analysis will be considered the primary analysis of immunogenicity  for the 
primary ser ies in a given age group. A second interim analysis of immunogenicity and safety will 
be performed after all or a subset of participants have completed Day 177/BD-Day 29 (1 month 
after third  dose).  
An interim analysis of safety for mRNA -1273.214 booster may be performed after all or subset 
of mRNA -1273.214 recipients have completed 6 months of follow -up after the booster dose.  
8.6.2 Final Analysis  
The final analysis of all endpoints will be performed after participants have completed all 
planned study procedure s. Results of this analysis will be presented in a final CSR, including 
individual listings.  
Additional information about all study analyses may be provided in the SAP.

Note:  In accordance with FDA Guidance on Conduct of Clinical Trials of Medical Products during COVID -19 Public Health Emerge ncy (FDA March 2020), 
investigators may convert study site visits to home visits or telemedicine visits (with the exception of Screening, Day 1, an d Day 29) with the approval of the 
Sponsor.  
1. Screening Visit and Day 1 may be combined on the same day. Additi onally, the Screening Visit may be performed over multiple visits if performed 
within the 28 -day screening window.  
2. If the visit for the second dose (Day  29) is disrupted and cannot be completed at Day 29 (+7 days) as a result of the COVID -19 pandemic (self -
quarantine or disruption of study site activities following business continuity plans and/or local government mandates for “s tay at home” or “shelter in 
place”), the visit window may be extended to Day  29 + 21 days. When the extended visit window is used,  the remaining study visits should be 
rescheduled to follow the intervisit interval from the actual date of the second dose. Refer to Section 6.1.1  for individual participant criteria for delay of 
study vaccination.  
3. To be conducted during Part 2 of the study in a cohort of participants at selected VTEU sites only.  
4. All scheduled study visits should be completed within the respective visit windows. If the participant is not able to attend a study site visit as a result of 
the COVID -19 pandemic (self -quarantine or disruption of study site activities following business continuity plans and/or local government mandates for 
“stay at home” or “shelter in pla ce”), a telemedicine visit should be conducted in place of the study site visit. The telemedicine visit should encompass 
all scheduled visit assessments that can be completed remotely, such as assessment for AEs and concomitant medications (eg, a s defined in scheduled 
safety telephone calls). Home visits will be permitted for all nondosing visits, with the exception of Screening, if a partic ipant cannot visit the study site 
as a result of the COVID -19 pandemic. Home visits must be permitted by the study sit e IRB and the participant’s parent(s)/LAR(s) via informed consent 
and have prior approval from the Sponsor (or its designee).  
5. Safety follow -up via an eDiary questionnaire will be performed every 4 weeks from Day  71 to Day  183 and again from Day  223 to Day 363. 
6. Safety follow -up via a safety telephone call will be performed every 4 weeks from Day  85 to Day  197 and again from Day  237 to Day  377. 
7. A full physical examination, including body temperature (oral [for participants > 4 years of age] or tympanic [f or participants ≤ 4 years of age]), 
length/height, and weight, will be performed at the Screening Visit or on Day  1. Symptom -directed physical examination will be performed on Day 1, 
Day 29, Day 43 (if the visit is applicable), Day  57, Day  209, and Day  394 and may be performed at other time points at the discretion of the 
investigator. Body mass index will be calculated only at Screening Visit. Body temperature (oral/tympanic) should be measured  on each injection day 
prior to injection. On each injection da y before injection and again 7 days after injection, the injection site should be examined. Any clinically 
significant finding identified during a study visit should be reported as an MAAE. Participants who are febrile (body tempera ture ≥  38.0°C/≥ 100.4°F)  
before injection on Day  1 or Day  29 must have the visit rescheduled within the relevant visit window to receive the injection. Afebrile participants with 
minor illnesses may be injected at the discretion of the investigator.  
8. Pregnancy test at Screening an d Day  1 and before the second study injection will be a point -of-care urine test and will be performed if deemed 
appropriate by the investigator. At the discretion of the investigator, a pregnancy test either via blood or point -of-care urine test can be pe rformed at any 
time during the study.  
9. On Day 1, sample must be collected prior to randomization and dosing. If a Day 1 (baseline) blood sample cannot be obtained i n Part 1, the participant 
will be considered either a screen failure due to inability to sati sfy inclusion criterion 3 or could be scheduled for rescreening. Participants may be 
rescreened 1 time, either within the same screening period for Part 1 or for a new screening period for Part 2 later in the s tudy. If the participant is 
rescreened and a b lood sample still cannot be obtained, then he/she will be considered a screen failure due to inability to satisfy inclusion c riterion 3.

each age group will be assigned to 1 of 5 phlebotomy cohorts ( Table 14). Participants in 3 of these 5 cohorts will pro vide blood specimens for 
immunogenicity at the following time points: Day 1, Day 57, and one of Day 29, Day 209, or Day 394 (such that each participan t provides a total of 3 
blood samples only). Participants in the Cohort D (remainder of the age group) wil l provide a blood sample at Day 1 (prior to randomization and the 
first dose) and within 4 days of receiving Dose 2 at Day  30 (+3 days) for storage and potential future biomarker testing. A fifth cohort of participants 
(selected VTEU sites only) will provi de blood samples for assessment of exploratory serology and CMI (S  protein -specific T -cell responses) on Day 1, 
Day 43, Day 209, and D394. Table 14 provides the blood sampling schedule in Part 2 of the study. If a Day 1 (baseline) blood sample cannot be 
obtained in either Part 1 or Part 2, the participant will be considered either a screen failure due to inability to satisfy i nclusion criterion 3 or co uld be 
rescheduled for rescreening. Participants may be rescreened 1 time, either within the same screening period for Part 1 or Par t 2 or in a new screening 
period of Part 2 if the initial screening was in Part 1. If the participant is rescreened and a bl ood sample still cannot be obtained, then he/she will be 
considered a screen failure due to inability to satisfy inclusion criterion 3.  
11. Part 2, Cohort D participants only, one ~4 mL blood draw. For participants already enrolled in Cohort D prior to Protoco l Amendment 4, this blood 
draw will be optional and confirmed at time of re -consenting; for all participants newly enrolled into Cohort D under Amendment 4, it is mandatory.  
12. The nasal swab sample (collected before dosing on injection day) will be used to a scertain the presence of SARS -CoV -2 via RT -PCR.  
13. An unscheduled visit may be prompted by reactogenicity issues or new or ongoing AEs.  
14. At each injection visit, participants’ parent(s)/LAR(s) will record data into the eDiary starting approximately 30 minutes after injection under the 
supervision of the study site staff to ensure successful entry of assessment. Participants’ parent(s)/LAR(s) will continue to  record entries in the eDiary 
after they leave the study site, preferably in the evening and at the same time each day, on the day of injection and for 6  days following injection. If a 
solicited local or systemic AR continues beyond Day 7 after vaccination, the participant’s parent(s)/LAR(s) will be prompted to capture details of the 
solicited local or system ic AR in the eDiary until the AR is resolved or the next IP injection occurs, whichever occurs first. Capturing details of AR s in 
the eDiary should not exceed 28  days after each vaccination. Adverse reactions recorded in eDiaries beyond Day  7 should be rev iewed by the study site 
staff either during the next scheduled telephone call or at the next study site visit.  
15. Trained study site personnel will call all participants to collect information relating to any MAAEs, SAEs, AEs leading to st udy withdrawal and 
information on concomitant medications associated with those events and any nonstudy vaccinations. In addition, study personne l will collect 
information on known participant exposure to someone with known COVID -19 or SARS -CoV -2 infection and on any COVID -19 symptoms the 
participant may experience.  
16. All concomitant medications and nonstudy vaccinations will be recorded through 28 days after each injection; all concomitant medications relevant to or 
for the treatment of an SAE or MAAE will be recorded from Day  1 through the final visit (Day  394). Non -Study COVID -19 vaccines should be 
reported through EOS.  
17. In addition to MIS -C and myocarditis and/or pericarditis , a list of AESIs pertinent to this study may be referenced in the list of AESIs that is maintained 
by the Sponsor and provided to each investigator. All SAEs and AESIs will be reported to the Sponsor or designee immediately and  in all circumstances 
within 24 hours of becoming aware of the event via the EDC system. If a site receives a report of a new SAE o r AESI from a study participant or 
receives updated data on a previously reported SAE or AESI and the eCRF has been taken offline, then the site can report this  information on a paper 
SAE or AESI form using the SAE Mailbox, the SAE Hotline, or the SAE Fax line ( Section 7.4.11 ). 
18. For Part 1, only the first approximately 75 participants in Study Arm 1 and Study Arm 2 will have postbaseline scheduled bloo d draws; the 300 
participants in each of the expansion part of Study Arm 1 and Study Arm 2 may have an optional blood draw on Day 57. All part icipants in Study Arms 
3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 will have postbaseline blood draws on Day 57, Day 209 and Day 394.

• Participant unblinds and has received mRNA -1273:  
− Participant remains in the study and continues with study visits as per SoA  Table  12. 
− Cohort D participants:  
1. If they cross -over after Day 30, they will  have already had this blood draw.  
2. If they cross -over between Dose 1 and Dose 2, they will NOT need to have the Day 30 blood draw.

2. Cross -over to mRNA -1273 (following Table  13- through Day 57 safety follow -up call)  
• A pregnancy test should be done for participants that are post -menarche prior to Dose 1 and Dose 2.  
• For the remainder of the study visits, as noted in  Table  13, the participants will be followed for MAAEs, SAEs,  
and AESIs and concomitant medication relevant to, or for the treatment of MAAEs and SAEs.  
• Participants will continue being followed for safety, which includes COVID -19 surveillance, using electronic 
eDiaries and safety follow -up calls that w ill continue to trigger from the participant’s original (placebo) 
administration date.  
• Participants will have a clinic visit at study Day 209 from the original (placebo) administration date. At this visit, 
they will have a symptom -directed physical exam,  if necessary, illness visit or convalescent visit work -up, if 
applicable, and a nasal swab. No blood samples will be required for this visit.  
• Participants will have a clinic visit at study Day 394 from the original (placebo) administration date. At this  visit, 
they will have a symptom -directed physical exam, if necessary, illness visit or convalescent visit work -up, if 
applicable, and a nasal swab.  
In summary:  No immunogenicity or serology samples will be required for cross -over participants unless they are part of a 
convalescent visit work -up or if they choose to receive a booster dose (as per  Table 15, they will require a BD -Day1 baseline blood 
draw. )

examined and the associated lymph nodes should be evaluated . At visits BD -3 (BD -D29), BD -4 (BD -D181) and BD -6 (BD -D366), a symptom -directed 
physical examination may be performed at the discretion of the investigator. Any clinically significant finding identified during a study visit should be 
reported as a MAAE. A n oral or tympanic temperature should be taken on the day of injection (BD -D1). Participants who are febrile (body temperature 
≥ 38.0°C/100.4°F) before dosing (BD -D1) must be rescheduled to receive the injection. Afebrile participants with minor illnesses can be vaccinated at 
the discretion of the investigator.  
3. Pregnancy test at BD -D1 before the booster dose injection will be a point -of-care urine test and will be performed if deemed appropriate by the 
investigator. At the discretion of the investigator, a pregnancy test either via blood or point -of-care urine test can be performed at any time during the 
study.  
4. Sample should be collected prior to dosing on BD -D1. 
5. Selected subgroups only; for details, see Table  16. Participants in sub -Cohort E original mRNA -1273 will have a blood sample for CMI  and exploratory 
serology . 
6. Post-dosing, participants will have a 30 -minute observation period. If any concerni ng symptoms occur, investigator may check vital signs during this 
period (however, no routine vital signs necessary after vaccination , except temperature as per 30 -minute eDiary,  if no concerning symptoms).  
7. An unscheduled visit may be prompted by reactogenicity issues  or new or ongoing AEs.  
8. The nasal swab sample must be collected prior to injection at the BD -1 visit.  
9. Trained study personnel will call all participants to collect information relating to any unsolicited AEs, MAAEs (including a ny signs  and symptoms of 
COVID -19), AESI, AEs leading to withdrawal, SAEs, information on concomitant medications associated with those events, and any nons tudy 
vaccinations.  
10. Age at time of enrollment determines which eDiary the participant will use. Diary entries  will be recorded by the participant at approximately 
30 minutes after injection while at the study site with instruction provided by study staff. Study participants will continue to  record entries in the eDiary 
each day after they leave the study site, pr eferably in the evening, on the day of injection and for 6 days following injection. If a solicited local or 
systemic AR continues beyond Day 7 after vaccination, the participant will be prompted to capture details of the solicited lo cal or systemic AR in the 
eDiary until the AR resolves; capture of details of ARs in the eDiary should not exceed 28 days after vaccination. Adverse re actions recorded in 
eDiaries beyond Day 7 should be reviewed either via telephone call or at the following study visit. Review of eDiary will occur on BD -D8 and BD -D29.  
11. All concomitant medications relevant to or for the treatment of an SAE, AESI, or MAAE will be recorded from screening through  the final visit. Non -
study COVID -19 vaccines will be recorded through EOS.

1. Screening Visit and Day 1 may be combined on the same day. Additionally, the Screening Visit may be performed over multiple v isits if performed 
within the 28 -day screening window.  
2. If the visit for the second dose (Day  29) is disrupted and cannot be completed at Day 29 (+7 days) as a result of the COVID -19 pandemic (self -
quarantine or disruption of study site activities following business continuity plans and/or local government mandates for “s tay at home” or “shelter in 
place”), the visit window may be extended to Day  29 + 21 days. When the extended visit window is used, the remaining study visits should be

Confidential  Page 171 rescheduled to follow the intervisit interval from the actual date of the second dose. Ref er to Section 6.1.1  for individual participant criteria for delay of 
study vaccination.  
3. All scheduled study visits should be completed within the respective visit windows. If the participant is not able to attend a study site visit as a result of 
the COVID -19 pandemic (self -quarantine or disruption of study site activities following business continuity plans and/or local government mandates for 
“stay at home” or “shelter in place”), a telemedicine visit should be conducted in place of the study site visit. The telemedicin e visit should encompass 
all scheduled visit assessments that can be completed remotely, such as assessment for AEs and concomitant  medications (eg, as defined in scheduled 
safety telephone calls). Home visits will be permitted for all nondosing visits, with the exception of Screening, if a partic ipant cannot visit the study site 
as a result of the COVID -19 pandemic. Home visits must be permitted by the study site IRB and the participant’s parent(s)/LAR(s) via informed consent 
and have prior approval from the Sponsor (or its designee).  
4. Safety follow -up via an eDiary questionnaire will be performed every 4 weeks from Day  71 to Day  183 a nd again from Day  191 to Day  303. 
5. Safety follow -up via a safety telephone call will be performed every 4 weeks from Day  85 to Day  197 and again from Day  205 to Day  317. 
6. A full physical examination, including body temperature (oral [for participants > 4 yea rs of age] or tympanic [for participants ≤ 4 years of age]), 
length/height, and weight, will be performed at the Screening Visit or on Day  1. Symptom -directed physical examination will be performed on Day 1, 
Day 29, Day  57, Day  149, Day  329, and Day 514 an d may be performed at other time points at the discretion of the investigator. Body mass index will 
be calculated only at Screening Visit. Body temperature (oral/tympanic) should be measured on each injection day prior to inj ection. On each injection 
day b efore injection and again 7 days after injection, the injection site should be examined. Any clinically significant finding i dentified during a study 
visit should be reported as an MAAE. Participants who are febrile (body temperature ≥  38.0°C/≥ 100.4°F) be fore injection on Day  1 Day  29, or Day 149 
must have the visit rescheduled within the relevant visit window to receive the injection. Afebrile participants with minor i llnesses may be injected at 
the discretion of the investigator.  
7. Pregnancy test at Screen ing and Day  1 and before the second and third study injection will be a point -of-care urine test and will be performed if deemed 
appropriate by the investigator. At the discretion of the investigator, a pregnancy test either via blood or point -of-care urin e test can be performed at any 
time during the study.  
8. On Day 1, sample must be collected prior to randomization and dosing. If a Day 1 (baseline) blood sample cannot be obtained i n Part 3, the participant 
will be considered either a screen failure due to i nability to satisfy inclusion criterion 3 or could be scheduled for rescreening. Participants may be 
rescreened 1 time. If the participant is rescreened and a blood sample still cannot be obtained, then he/she will be consider ed a screen failure due to 
inability to satisfy inclusion criterion 3.  
9. On Day 149, sample must be collected prior to dosing.  
10. Sub-Cohort F only, see Table 18 for details.  
11. Sub-Cohort  G only, see Table 18 for details.  
12. The nasal swab sample (collected before dosing on injection day) will be used to ascertain the presence of SARS -CoV -2 via RT -PCR.  
13. An unscheduled visit may be prompted by reactogenicity issues, or new or ongoing AEs.  
14. A convalescent visit may be scheduled approximately 28 days (+7 days) after diagnosis of COVID -19 if there are any doubts about initial diagnosis ( at 
investigator’s discretion). At this visit, a blood sample for potential immunologic assessment of SARS -CoV -2 infection will be collected.  
15. At each injection visit, participants’ parent(s)/LAR(s) will record data into the eDiary starting approximately 30 minutes after injection under the 
supervision of the study site staff to ensure successful entry of assessment. Participants’ parent(s)/LAR(s) will continue to  record entries in the eDiary 
after they leave the study site, preferably in the evening and at t he same time each day, on the day of injection and for 6  days following injection. If a 
solicited local or systemic AR continues beyond Day 7 after vaccination, the participant’s parent(s)/LAR(s) will be prompted to capture details of the 
solicited local o r systemic AR in the eDiary until the AR is resolved or the next IP injection occurs, whichever occurs first. Capturing detai ls of ARs in 
the eDiary should not exceed 28  days after each vaccination. Adverse reactions recorded in eDiaries beyond Day  7 shoul d be reviewed by the study site 
staff either during the next scheduled telephone call or at the next study site visit.

10.2.10  Sample Retention and Future Biomedical Research  
The retention period of laboratory samples will be 20 years, or as permitted by local regulations, 
to address further scientific questions related to mRNA -1273 or anti -respiratory virus immune 
response. In addition, identifiable samples can be destroyed at any time at the request  of the 
participant. During the study, or during the retention period, in addition to the analysis outlined 
in the study endpoints, exploratory analysis may be conducted using other Ab -based 
methodologies on any remaining blood or serum samples, including samples from participants 
who are screened but are not subsequently enrolled and samples collected and stored from 
Cohort D in Part 2. These analyses will extend the search for other potentially relevant 
biomarkers to investigate the effect of mRNA -1273, a s well as to determine how changes in 
biomarkers may relate to exposure and clinical outcomes. A decision to perform such 
exploratory research may arise from new scientific findings related to the drug class or disease, 
as well as reagent and assay availab ility.

Woman of Childbearing Po tential (WOCBP)  
Females of childbearing potential are those who are considered fertile following menarche and 
unless permanently sterile (see below). If fertility is unclear (eg, amenorrhea in adolescents or 
athletes) and a menstrual cycle cannot be confir med before first dose of IP, additional evaluation 
should be considered.  
Women in the following categories are not considered WOCBP:  
1. Premenarchal  
2. Surgically sterile female with one of the following:  
a. Documented complete hysterectomy  
b. Documented surgical sterilization  
For individuals with permanent infertility due to an alternate medical cause other than the 
above (eg, Mullerian agenesis, androgen insensitivity), investigator discretion should be 
applied in determining study entry.  
Note: Documentation can come from the study site personnel’s review of the 
participant’s medical records, medical examination, or medical history interview.  
Contraception Guidance:  
Adequate female contraception is defined as consistent and correct use of an FDA -approved 
contracep tive method in accordance with the product label, for example:  
Barrier method (such as condoms, diaphragm, or cervical cap) used in conjunction with 
spermicide  
Intrauterine device  
Prescription hormonal contraceptive taken or administered via the oral (pill ), transdermal 
(patch), subdermal, or IM route  
Note: While complete abstinence is accepted  as adequate female contraception in this age 
group, periodic abstinence (eg, calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation methods) and 
withdrawal are not  acceptable methods of contraception.

10.5.1  Amendment  8, 23 May  2022  
Main Rationale for the Amendment:  
The main purpose of this amendment is to  unblind recipients receiving placebo who are under 
6 years of age 6 months following their second vaccine dose so that they could be provided the 
option of receiving the crossover vaccine. Given the positive interim analysis data for this age 
group, and t he pending regulatory review, at least 6 months of blinded follow up is deemed 
appropriate, and milestone unblinding will be implemented at this point.  
The summary of changes table provided below describes the major changes made to Amendment 
8 relative to Amendment 7, including the sections modified and their corresponding rationales. 
The synopsis of Amendment 8 has been modified to correspond to changes in the body of the 
protocol. Minor copy edits and administrative updates were made throughout the protoc ol to 
align with new content as well as for clarity  and/or accuracy.

reasons other than safety or 
health concerns after 6 months 
after Dose 2 will be allowed.  To allow participants who 
received placebo in the primary 
series to receive mRNA -1273.  
6.4 (Study Pause Rules [Table 
5]) Added a footnote to specify that 
the events in participants 
receiving boosters will be 
considered separately from the 
events during the primary 
vaccination seri es. To clarify how pause rule events 
will be analyzed.  
7.1.1 (Use of Electronic Diaries)  Added that symptom -directed 
physical examination will be 
performed on BD -Day 1 for 
participants who receive 
boosters.  To clarify when participants 
receiving boosters will have 
physical examination.

participants.  To clarify when the blind should 
be maintained.  
8.1.1 (Breaking the Blind)  Clarified that participants who 
turn 5 years old during the study 
will be eligible for unblinding.  Because of the availability of an 
authorized COVID -19 vaccine 
for 5 -year-old children.  
8.2 (Statistical Hypothesis)  Added the description of 
hypothesis testing for BD for the 
participants in Part  1. To specify that participants in

10.5.2  Amendment  7, 18 Feb 2022  
Main Rationale for the Amendment:  
ModernaTX, Inc.  
mRNA -1273 -P204 Protocol Amendment 9  mRNA -1273  
Confidential  Page 199 The main purpose of this amendment is to introduce an optional booster dose for all participants 
in Part 1 (all age groups) and for 6 to < 12 year old participants in Part 2 of the study. While this 
study is primarily desi gned to assess a 2 -dose primary series of mRNA -1273 in children 6 
months to < 12 years, the emergence of the recent SARS -CoV -2 variant of concern ‘Omicron’ 
has shown in adults that protection from infection after 2 doses is less than after booster doses, 
although 2 doses still protect well against severe disease, hospitalization, and death. The optimal 
time after Dose 2 for a booster dose is not known, and recommendations currently range between 
3 to 6 months post Dose 2 around the world for adults who have  received the mRNA -1273 
primary series. This amendment will allow participants (Part 1 [all age groups] and for 6 
to < 12 year old participants in Part 2 of the study) to be offered a booster dose 6 months after 
Dose 2 or cross -over Dose 2, depending on wh ether they received mRNA -1273 at the time of 
enrollment or whether they received placebo followed by cross over vaccination with 
mRNA -1273. Given the staggered enrollment in Part 1 and Part 2, as well as timing of cross -
over, this will allow for the collec tion of data across a range of boost intervals.  
The dosage level of the booster dose will be based on age at time of booster and will be a lower 
dose than the primary series. Per the experience in adults (for whom the booster dosage level is 
currently half  of the primary series), giving a lower booster dose allows for a robust response in 
neutralizing antibodies while reducing reactogenicity and allows for dose sparing, without 
compromising efficacy.

SARS -CoV -2 variant of concern 
‘Omicron’ has shown in adults  
that protection from infection after 
2 doses is less than after booster 
doses, although 2 doses still 
protect well against severe

and this edit was made to clarify 
that only severe CO VID-19 cases 
need to be reported as indicated.  
Global  Terminology change: The “booster 
dose” for Part 3 was changed to 
“third dose.”  This was done to differentiate 
between the third dose design in 
Part 3 versus the booster dose 
being offered to select pa rticipants 
in Parts 1 and 2.

studying the safety, tolerability, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of a lower dose level and 
regimen for 6 years to < 12 year old children that could be implemented. The addition of an 
Open -Label Study Arm 14 for this age group with a sample size of approximately 
300 participants who will receive two doses of 25 µg one month apart followed by a booster at 
least 3 m onths after the second dose will allow for assessment of reactogenicity and

10.5.4  Amend ment 5 , 29 Sep 221  
Main Rationale for the Amendment:  
This amendment is considered to be non -substantial based on the criteria set forth in Article 
10(a) of Directive 2001/20/European Commission (EC)  of the European Parliament and the 
Council of the European Union.  
The main rationale for this amendment is to simplify the process for potential cross -over 
vaccination given the increased sample size of the study and to ensure retention in the study for 
safety follow -up, incorporate Clarification Memo #8, align with the Cardiac Event Adjudication 
Committee (CEAC) charter, and clarify the Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) safety data 
review process for the younger age groups (2 to < 6 years; 6 months to < 2 years) to match the 
process in the older age group (6 to < 12 years) and allow DSMB review of Part 1 (open -label 
phase) data before start of Part  2 (blinded phase) for the younger age groups. Additional updates 
were made to clarify the statistical analy sis plan, including the inferred efficacy analysis and 
interim analyses.  
The summary of changes table provided below describes the major changes made to Amendment 
5 relative to Amendment 4, including the sections modified and corresponding rationales. The 
synopsis of Amendment 5 has been modified to correspond to changes in the body of the 
protocol. Minor copy edits and administrative updates were made throughout the protocol to 
align with new content as well as for clarity, readability, and/or accuracy.

days).  
Section 3.3 (Justification for 
Dose, Control Product, and 
Choice of Study Population), 
Appendix 1 (Schedule of 
Assessments)  Made updates to Section 3.3 to 
clarify the justification for the 
choice of study population, 
including unblinding of eligible 
study particip ants, placebo 
recipient cross -over vaccination, 
booster dose eligibility for 
participants who received a lower 
dose in Part 1 than was ultimately 
approved for their respective age 
group in Part 2, and study 
discontinuation for participants 
receiving an EUA  vaccine outside 
the protocol.  
 
In accordance with changes made 
to Section 3.3, updated text and 
Table 11 in Appendix 1 to clarify 
placebo recipient cross -over 
vaccination.  Given the increase in sample size, 
unblinding via clinic visit is no 
longer feasibl e and will instead be 
performed over the phone, if 
desired by the family. To ensure 
retention in the study for safety 
follow -up, cross -over vaccination 
will be offered to all placebo 
recipients per their request if any 
COVID -19 vaccine (mRNA -1273 
or other)  becomes authorized or 
licensed for their age group.  
Section 4.2 (Exclusion 
Criteria)  Added text to exclusion criteria  #8 
to provide context related to the 
influenza vaccine.  For incorporation of Clarification 
Memo #8.  
Section 6.1.1 (Individual 
Participant Criteria for Delay 
of Study Vaccination)  Provided text in Section 6.1.1 to 
describe additional reasons to delay 
study vaccination for participants.  For incorporation of Clarification 
Memo #8.  
Section 7.3.3 
(Follow -up/Convalescent 
Period After Diagnosis with 
COVID -19) Deleted text, “Study participants 
will be monitored by trained study 
site personnel for a 28 day period 
after diagnosis.”  For accuracy.  
 
Section 7.4.5 (Adverse 
Events of Special Interest), 
Section 7.5.2 (Data Safety 
Monitoring Board)  Clarified that the CEAC will 
review suspected cases of 
myocarditis/pericarditis to 
determine if they meet CDC 
criteria of “probable” or 
“confirmed” event and to assess 
severity, but recommendations to 
the Sponsor to continue vaccine 
dosing will be m ade by DSMB.  To align with CEAC charter.

DSMB review and scope for 
younger age groups (2 to < 6 years; 
6 months to < 2 years) from 
separate reviews in each age group 
with data f rom Part 1 and Part 2 
during the conduct of Part  2 to one 
review of all available Part 1 safety 
data for all doses used in < 6 years 
before start of Part 2 for each age 
group.  To allow the DSMB to review 
data from Part 1 (open -label 
phase) for all doses us ed in < 6 
year old participants before 
starting Part 2 for 2 to < 6  years 
and 6 months to <  2 years age 
groups.  
Section 8.5.4 (Inferred 
Efficacy Analysis)  Added text to explain the 
following: 1) analyses of efficacy 
endpoints in Part 2 will be 
performed f or the randomized 
blinded phase, and 2) additional 
exploratory analyses will be 
conducted in the blinded and 
unblinded phases for participants 
randomized to mRNA -1273 in Part 
2, and in the unblinded phase for 
participants who are originally 
randomized to t he placebo arm and 
cross -over to mRNA -1273 after 
use of any COVID -19 vaccine is 
authorized or licensed for the 
participant’s age group.  For clarification.  
Section 8.6.1 (Interim 
Analyses)  Updated description of Part 2 to 
indicate that an interim analysis  of 
immunogenicity and safety will be 
performed after all or a subset of 
participants have completed Day 
57 (1 month after the second dose) 
in Part 1 or Part  2 within an age 
group.  For clarification.  
Appendix  1 (Schedule of 
Assessments; Table 10 and

Main Rationale for the Amendment:  
The main rationale for this amendment is to introduce an additional blood draw within 4 days 
after the second dose for participants in Cohort D in Part 2 in each age group. The samples will 
be stored for potential future analysis per a request from the FDA. For participants already 
enrolled in Cohor t D prior to protocol amendment 4 implementation at the site, this blood draw 
will be optional and confirmed at time of re -consenting; for all participants newly enrolled into

Main Rationale for the Amendment:  
The main rationale for this amendment is to add a case definition for myocarditis and pericarditis 
as well as guidance for reporting and assessing suspected case s for this study, given the recent 
emergence of a temporal association between mRNA vaccine administration and signs and 
symptoms of myocarditis/pericarditis.  
In addition, the sample size for each age group in Part 2 (blinded part) is increased to allow for a 
95% probability to detect a rare adverse event occurring at a rate of 1 in 1,000.

protocol.  To include AESI list in the protocol 
instead of a separate document.  
10.5.7  Amendment 2,  17 Jun 2021  
Main Rationale for the Amendment:  
The main rationale for this amendment is to add an optio nal blood collection on Day  57 for 
participants in the expansion part of Arm 1 and Arm 2 to gather additional data on 
immunogenicity. The handling of potential unblinding requests in Part 2 is further clarified. In 
addition, the decision in Part 1 to not e valuate the 100 -µg dose in participants less than 2  years 
old is integrated into this amendment by removing Arm 7 (6 months to <  2 years, 100  µg dose) 
from this age group. The change in dose level is based on moderate, increased reactogenicity 
observed in Arm 2 (6 to <  12 years of age, 100 µg), which led to the decision to not evaluate the 
100-µg dose in the 2 to <  6 years age group. In order to maintain dose -ranging in the 2  to < 6

General Design  Clarified that preliminary safety and 
immunogenicity data of Arm 1 (6 to < 
12 years of age, 50  µg) and Arm 2 (6 to 
< 12 years of age, 100  µg), as 
applicable, will aid in the selection of a 
dose level for Part  2. Tolerability and safety data will be 
available from both doses (50 and 100 
µg) and will be an essential metric for 
dose selection. Additionally, 
immunogenicity data from the 50 -µg 
dose (a dose lower than the 100 -µg 
dose assessed in the P301 adult efficacy 
trial) will allow for assessment of t he 
likelihood of the 50 -µg dose to meet 
noninferiority criteria. These data will 
allow an informed dose selection 
decision for Part 2.  
Protocol Synopsis 
and Section 3.1 
General Design  Revised the age group and dose level of 
Arm 7 (6  months to <  2 years of  age, 
100 µg) to 2 to <  6 years and 25  µg of 
mRNA -1273. Arm 7 was made optional, 
the 25 -µg dose will be evaluated if 100 -
µg dose is eliminated at any point during 
the dose -escalation process, to maintain 
dose ranging.  The 100 -µg dose was not evaluated in 
participants aged <  2 years based on the 
internal safety team recommendation. 
The dose level and age group of Arm 7 
was revised to maintain dose -ranging in 
the 2 to <  6 years age group by adding a 
lower dose than originally planned 
(25 µg).

(mRNA -1273 or other) is authorized or 
licensed, eligible study participants will 
be offered the opportunity to unblind, 
and a nasal swab and a blood sample 
will be collected. Participants who 
received mRNA -1273 will continue in 
the study. If a participant previously 
received placebo and mRNA -1273 is 
authorized for use in the participant’s 
age group, the participant will be offered 
unblinding followed b y a cross -over 
vaccination with mRNA -1273. If 
mRNA -1273 is not yet authorized for 
the relevant age group, but an alternative 
vaccine is authorized, previous placebo 
recipients may seek the alternative 
vaccine and withdraw from study.  To clarify plans for u nblinding 
requests.

Protocol Synopsis 
and Section 7.5.2 
Data Safety 
Monitoring Board  Clarified that the DSMB will review 
safety data from a subset of 
approximately 300 participants at the 
selected dose level in the 6 to <  12 years 
age group rather than the full safety set 
for Arm 1 and Arm 2 from Part  1 
(N = 750 participants) before allowing 
the start of enrollment in Part 2.  Dose selection will be based on safety 
data from approximately 300 
participants. Approximately 300 
participants will have reached Day  43. 
This will expedite expansion of the 
study. The safety review will still allow 
for detection of an AE occurring at a 
rate ~ 1% (N  = ~ 375 participants per 
group remains the same).  
Protocol Synopsis

Data Safety 
Monitoring Board  For both the middle age group (2 to < 6

10.5.8  Amendment 1,  30 Apr 2021  
Main Rationale for the Amendment:  
The main purpose of this amendment is to allow a Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) safety 
review when approximately 375 children have received mRNA -1273 in each age group, before 
expanding enrollment to each fu ll age cohort. This review will allow assessment of less frequent 
adverse events (AEs), occurring at a rate of approximately 1 in 100. Per this amendment, this 
will be achieved in different ways for each of the 3 age groups:  
1. For the 6 to < 12 years of age group: To expedite this formal safety review in school -aged 
children, an additional 300 participants will be enrolled to each dose level in Part  1 (ie, to 
have n = 375 per dose group), and the DSMB will review Day 57 safety data for all 375 
participants in  each dose group before advancing this age group to Part 2.  
2. For the 2 to < 6 years and 6 months to < 2 years of age groups: DSMB safety review will 
occur within Part 2, at a time when it is anticipated that a total of approximately 
375 participants (accoun ting for the 3:1 randomization to vaccine or placebo in the 
blinded Part 2) have been exposed to mRNA -1273 at the dose level selected for Part  2. 
DSMB will occur when Day 57 safety data from this subset is available for review.

Criteria)  Language was added to clarify that 
the height and weight of children <  2 
years of age must both meet or 
exceed the 3rd percentile according to 
WHO Child Growth Standard at the 
Screening Visit.  Height and weight are better 
measures of growth than BMI 
for children <  2 years of age.  
Protocol Synopsis and 
Section 4.1 (Inclusion 
Criteria)  The heading before criterion 7, 
“Special inclusion criteria for 
children 6 months to < 2 years of 
age” was updated  to “Special 
inclusion criteria for children 6 
months to < 12 months of age”.   Exclusion of prematurity is 
considered relevant only for 
children under 12  months of age 
in the context of mRNA 
vaccines (not live vaccines).  
Protocol Synopsis and 
Section 4.2 (Exclusion 
Criteria)  A note was added to the exclusion of 
febrile seizures to indicate that a 
history of a simple, single febrile 
seizure is allowed for children 
6 years and older in Part 2 of the 
study.  The risk of febr ile seizures is 
most relevant for children up to 
6 years of age. Once the safety 
data has been reviewed in Part  1, 
children 6 years of age and older 
can be included even with a 
history of a single, simple febrile 
seizures.  
Protocol Synopsis, Section 
3.1 (General Design), 
Section 5.2 
(Randomization), and 
Section 8.3 (Power and 
Sample Size)  The sample size was increased from 
750 to 1,350 participants in Part 1.  
 
Sample size in Part 2 was adjusted in 
the 6 to < 12 years of age group from 
2,000 to 1,700 (mRNA -1273 arm 
~1,275 participants; placebo arm 
~425 participants).  To reflect changes per main 
rationale for Amendment.

between age groups was added.  To reflect updates for the 
statistical plan.  
Section 3.3 (Justification for 
Dose, Control Product, and 
Choice of Study Population)  Language was updated to indicate 
that if immunogenicity criteria are 
successfully met in P204 age cohorts, 
blinded placebo participants will be 
given the opportunity to receive the 
mRNA -1273 vaccine, and 
participant s who received a lower 
dose than the dose receiving 
Emergency Use Authorization will 
be provided a booster with the 
‘optimal dose’ for a given age group.  To describe the planned 
approach to dosing placebo 
recipients and lower dose 
recipients in case of Eme rgency

Section 7.1.5 (Assessment 
for SARS -CoV -2 infection)  Language was updated to include 
further clarification on procedures to 
follow when participant is exposed to 
an individual with confirmed 
SARS -CoV -2 infection. A definition 
of last exposure was also added.  
 
Language was added to clarify that 
an initial assessment will be 
performed at a study illness visit to 
determine general appearance, and to 
provide details as to whom may 
perform the assessment.  To provide a clear definition of 
last exposure, and the processes 
and timing to follow when a 
participant is exposed to a 
confirmed SARS -CoV -2 
infected person.  
 
Clarification of which providers 
can perform initial assessmen ts 
for illness visits.

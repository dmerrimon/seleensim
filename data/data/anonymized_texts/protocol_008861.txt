Nam e of Study Drug:   Upadacitinib Phase of Developm ent:  2
Nam e of Active Ingredient:   Upadacitinib Date of Protocol Synopsis:   01December 2020
Protocol Title:   Phase 2 Study, Multicenter, Open -Label Extension (OLE) Study in Rheumatoid 
Arthritis Subjects who have Completed a Preceding Phase 2 Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) w ith 
Upadacitinib (ABT -494)
Objective:
Main Study
To evaluate the long -term safety, tolerability, and efficacy of upadacitinib RA subjects who have 
completed Study M13 -550 or Study M13 -537 Phase 2 RCT with upadacitinib.
Optional Vaccine Sub -study:   To assess the impact of upadacitinib treatment (15 mg QD or 30 mg QD) 
with a stable background of MTX on immunological responses following administration of Prevnar 13®
pneumococcal vaccine in RA patients (Appendix O).
Investigators:   Multicenter
Study Site s:  118 sites
Study Population:   Adult female and male RA subjects who have completed the Last Visit (Week 12) 
of Study M13 -550 or Study M13 -537 Phase 2 RCT w ith upadacitinib, and who have met all of the 
specified inclusion and exclusion criteria.
Number of Subjects to be Enrolled:   494 subjects have been enrolled in this OLE study.
Methodology:
This is an extension study to assess the long -term safety, tolerability, and efficacy of upadacitinib in RA 
subjects who have completed Study M13 -550 or Study M13 -537 RCT w ith upadacitinib.  On ly those 
subjects who have met all of the specified inclusion and exclusion criteria will have an option to enter 
into the OLE study to receive upadacitinib, as long as the subject is willing and the Investigator believes 
that continuing the therapy with u padacitinib is appropriate.
All eligible subjects will be assigned to upadacitinib 6 mg BID immediately after or up to 30 days 
following the Last Visit (Week 12) of Study M13 -550 or Study M13 -537.  Subjects who are unable to 
tolerate 6 mg BID w ill be disco ntinued from the study.  At Week 6, if a subject fails to achieve at least 
20% improvement from RCT Baseline in both Tender Joint Count (TJC) and Sw ollen Joint Count 
(SJC), upadacitinib dose should be increased to 12 mg BID as long as the Investigator has no safety 
concerns.  After 6 w eeks of treatment with upadacitinib 12 mg BID, the improvement in TJC and SJC 
will be re- assessed at next scheduled visit (Week 12).  If the subject on 12 mg BID fails to achieve at 
least 20% improvement in both TJC and SJC fr om RCT Baseline the subject w ill be discontinued.  At 
Week 12, the same process will be follow ed.  If a subject still on 6 mg BID fails to achieve at least 20% 
improvement from RCT Baseline in both TJC and SJC, upadacitinib dose should be increased to 12 m g 
BID.  The improvement in TJC and SJC will be re -assessed after 6 w eeks of treatment with 12 mg BID 
at Week 18 (an optional study visit).  Subjects who fail to achieve at least 20% improvement from RCT 
Baseline in both TJC and SJC with 12 mg BID at Week 1 8 will be discontinued.

Methodology (Continued):
After Week 12, if a subject fails to show at least 20% improvement from RCT Baseline in TJC and SJC 
at 2 consecutive scheduled study visits then the subject will be discontinued.
Starting at Week 6 and during any scheduled or unscheduled visits thereafter, upadacitinib dose may be 
increased from 6 mg BID to 12 mg BID (or 30 mg QD from January 2017, see below  for more details) if 
a subject fails to achieve Low Disease Activity (LDA) status (CDAI > 10) and has no safety concerns 
per Investigator's judgment.
At any visit, upadacitinib dose may be decreased back to 6 mg BID (or 15 mg QD from January 2017) 
per Investigator's judgment if there are safety and/or tolerability concerns due to an adverse event or 
reaching one of the protocol specific toxicity management thresholds.  Dose increase back to 12 mg BID 
(or 30 mg QD from January 2017) is not allow ed.
From  January 2017, all subjects who are at Week 72 or beyond will receive a once -daily tablet 
formulation.   Subjects who are on 6 mg BID capsule dosing w ill be transitioned to 15 mg QD tablet 
dosing.  Subjects who are on 12 mg BID capsule dosing will be transitioned to 30 mg QD tablet dosing.  
The capsule formulation will not be available to subjects once the transition to tablet formulation has 
occurred.  Please see additional details in Section 5.1.  Starting with Amendment 5, subjects who are 
receiving 30 mg QD open -label upadacitinib will have the option to decrease the dose to 15 mg QD 
based on investigato r's discretion.

3.0 Introduction
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic s ystemic inflammatory  disease of unknown 
etiology .  The hallmark feature of patients affected by  RA is an inflammatory  process 
manifested b y persistent symmetric pol yarthritis of sy novial joints, and oftentimes 
includes sy stemic inflammatory  manifestations in extra -articular organ s ystems.  Earl y 
therap y with disease -modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) is the standard of care, 
although a significant proportion of patients either do not achieve disease remission or 
become refractory  to available therapies as the disease progresses.  Novel therapies are 
therefore requir ed to complement the available interventions to address the unmet need in 
the treatment of patients with RA.  Evidence suggests that inhibition of the Janus 
activated kinase (JAK) -mediated pathway s is a promising approach for the treatment of 
patients with this chronic disorder.1
The JAK family  is composed of 4 famil y members:  JAK1, 2, 3, and Tyrosine ki nase 2 
(Tyk2).  These cy toplasmic ty rosine kinases are associated with membrane cy tokine 
receptors such as common gamma -chain (CGC) receptors and the gl ycoprotein 
130(gp130) transmembrane proteins.2  Almost 40 cy tokine receptors signal through 
combinations of these four JAKs and their seven downstream substrates of the Signal 
Transduction Activators of Tr anscription (STAT) family .3  Activation of these 
JAK-related pathway s initiates expression of survival factors, cy tokines, chemokines and 
other molecules that facilitate leukocy te cellular trafficking and cell proliferation which 
contribute to inflammatory  and autoimmune disorders.
JAK3 and JAK1 are components of the CGC cy tokine receptor complexes and blo ckade 
of either inhibits signaling b y the inflammatory  cytokines interleukin (IL) -2, 4, 7, 9, 15 
and 21.3  Furthermore, other pathologicall y relevant cytokines such as IL -6 are known to 
recruit JAK1, JAK2 and Ty k2 upon binding to its receptor, with IL -6 appearing to signal 
predominantly  via JAK1.4,5  Hen ce, the JAK family has evoked considerable interest in 
the area of inflammatory  diseases leading for the development of various JAK inhibitors 
with different selectivity  profiles against JAK1, JAK2, JAK3 and Tyk2.  Tofacitinib 
(Xeljanz®; Pfizer®) is a non -selective JAK inhibitor that targets all 4 members of the JAK

family ; the rank order of cellular potency  is JAK3, JAK1, JAK2 and Ty k2.1  Tofacitinib is 
approved in the United States and is indicated for treatment of adult patients with 
moderatel y to severel y active RA who have had an inadequate response or intolerance to 
MTX.9  The approved dose is 5 mg BID and it can be used as monotherap y or in 
combination with MTX or other non-biologic disease -modify ing antirheumatic drugs 
(DMARDs).  Recently  tofacitinib was approved in Japan, Russia, and Switzerland.
Upadacitinib is a novel JAK1 inhibitor being developed for the treatment of adult patients 
with moderatel y to severely activ e RA, either alone or in combination with methotrexate 
(MTX) or other non -biologic DMARDs.  Based on in vitro selectivity  assay s and in -vivo
animal models, upadacitinib has demonstrated that inhibiting JAK1 with minimal impact 
on JAK2 is feasible at effica cious drug exposure levels.  Thus, the enhanced selectivity  of 
upadacitinib has the potential for an improved benefit/risk profile in treating patients with 
RA by  mitigating JAK2 inhibitory  effects on ery thropoiesis and my elopoiesis.  Also, the 
minimum of activity  of upadacitinib against JAK3, which is involved in IL -15 signal 
transduction cascade, could potentially  minimize a decrease in NK cell counts observed 
with tofacitinib clinical development program that may have contributed to increased 
incidences of viral infection, re -activation of herpes zoster, and malignancies.
The toxicology  profile of upadacitinib has been evaluated in multiple chronic studies in 
rats and dogs.  Briefl y, nonadverse findings in rats included mild decreases in red blood 
cell counts, hemoglobin and dose -dependent decreases in circulating l ymphocy tes.  At 
very high doses of upadacitinib (50 to 100 mg/kg/day) the adverse findings included 
mortality  as well as tubular degeneration/regeneration in the kidney  and liver necrosis.  In 
dog studies there were dose -related decreases in hemoglobin and red cell mass (red blood 
cell counts, hemoglobin concentration, hematocrit) and microscopic findings in popliteal 
lymph nodes (mixed cell inflammation in inter -digital skin of paws and draining lymph 
nodes) considered secondary  to potential upadacitinib -related immunomodulation.  A 
detailed summary  of the pre -clinical toxicology  results can be found in the current 
Investigator's Brochure.6

There have been two clinical studies of upadacitinib.  The clinical conduct of 
Study M13 -401, a single -dose ascending dose study of upadacitinib at 1 mg up to 48 mg, 
has been completed.  This study  also included an assessment of the effect of food on the 
pharmacokinetics of upadacitinib.  Preliminary  results indicated that food had no effect on 
the exposure (AUC) of upadacitinib.  Therefore, upadacitinib can be administered with or 
without food in the present study .
Preliminary  results after multiple ascending doses of upadacitinib in healthy volunteers 
are available from Study  M13 -845.  The randomized, double -blind, placebo controlled 
study  was designed to eval uate the safet y, tolerability and PK of upadacitinib at four dose 
levels of 3 mg, 6 mg, 12 mg and 24 mg BID.  In each dose group, 8 subjects were 
randomly  assigned to receive upadacitinib and 3 subjects received placebo administered 
twice dail y (BID) for 1 4 consecutive day s.  No serious or fatal adverse events or AEs 
leading to discontinuation were reported during the study.  Treatment -emergent adverse 
events (TEAE) were reported in 7 (58.3%) subjects receiving placebo and in 
11(34.3%) subjects receiving A BT-494 with the overall incidence of TEAEs at 
2(25.0%), 2 (25.0%), 3 (37.5%) and 4 (50%) of subjects experienced TEAEs in the 3 mg, 
6 mg, 12 mg and 24 mg dose groups, respectivel y.  All TEAEs were considered mild 
(Grade 1) in severity  and reported to have a reasonable possibility  of being related to 
study  drug except 2 events in one subject in the placebo group were considered as having 
no reasonable possibility  of being related.  The most common TEAEs in the upadacitinib 
treatment groups (n =32) were hea dache (15.6%), abdominal pain (6.3%), diarrhea 
(6.3%), and nasophary ngitis (6.3%).  No clinicall y meaningful changes in laboratory 
values, vital signs or ECG findings were observed during the stud y.
Preliminary  results indicated that at stead y state, upada citinib had minimal to no 
accumulation with a median T maxof approximately 2 hours and an effective half -life of 
approximately  3 hours.  Upadacitinib exposure was approximately  dose -proportional 
across the dose range studied.  Approximately 19% to 21% of u padacitinib was excreted 
as unchanged parent in the urine during a dose interval in the stead y state.

3.1 Differences Statement
This OL E study  is designed to collect long -term safety , tole rability , and efficacy  data.  
Collecting long- term safety  data is important to assess the risk to benefit profile of 
upadacitinib.  All subjects who have completed the Last Visit (Week 12) of 
Study M13 -550 or Study  M13 -537 upadacitinib Phase 2 RCT (12 – 24weeks) will have 
an opportunity  to enroll into this OL E study .  This is the first study  with upadacitinib of 
treatment durations longer than 24 weeks.
3.2 Benefits and Risks
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, s ystemic, autoimmune disease characterized by
inflammation of the articular sy novial membrane.  If left untreated, RA causes damage to 
cartilage, bone, and adjoining tissues which ultimately leads to severe disability , impaired 
function, and marked reduction in the quality  of life of subjects.  The p revalence of RA in 
the general population is approximately  1%, and increases with age in both genders, with 
women being more prone for developing RA than men.
The etiology  of RA has not been fully  elucidated, but based on the pathologic mechanisms 
of RA, s everal pro -inflammatory  pathway s and cy tokines such as TNF, interferon gamma, 
IL-1 and other interleukins have been identified in promoting s ynovial inflammation and 
bone and cartilage destruction.  Clinical efficacy in targeting these proinflammatory 
cytokines and downstream signaling pathway s has been well validated in RA.  Several 
inhibitors of Janus activated kinases (JAKs), a family  of intracellular t yrosine kinases that 
transduces cy tokine -mediated signals, demonstrated proof of concept first with cur rently 
marketed tofacitinib and with other emerging second generation JAK inhibitors that are in 
the clinic for reducing the signs and s ymptoms in RA subjects.11,12
The JAK family  of tyrosine kinases com prises 4 members, JAK1, JAK2, JAK3 and 
TYK2.  The second generation of JAK inhibitors currentl y in development for RA

display s a vary ing potency  and selectivity  directed at members of the JAK family .1  
Tofacitinib is a non- selective JAK inhibitor targeting JAK1, JAK2 and JAK3, but most 
potently  inhibits JAK3.1  Although tofacitinib improves the clinical signs and symptoms 
of RA, questions remain surrounding t he safety  profile regarding the incidences of serious 
infection, malignancies, herpes zoster, and hematologic adverse events.
Data from clinical studies in RA subjects with tofacitinib showed reduced levels of 
hemoglobin, absolute l ymphocytes counts, and t otal white blood cell counts in some 
subjects and also increased serum creatinine; total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol (LDL -C), 
and HDL cholesterol (HDL -C); and liver transaminases (ALT and AST).7,8  The i ncreases 
in serum creatinine, lipids, and liver transaminase values typically have been 
asymptomatic, reversible, and were not associated with any  overt declines in renal or 
hepatic function.
Upadacitinib is a novel JAK1 selective inhibitor with minimal in hibitory  effects on JAK2 
and JAK3, which could potentially  minimize some of the reported safety  concerns with 
non-selective JAK inhibitors which are thought to be mediated b y inhibition of JAK2 and 
JAK3 signaling pathways.  I nitiation of Phase 2 studies wi th upadacitinib was feasible 
based on acceptable safety and tolerability profile of upadacitinib in single ascending dose 
and multiple ascending dose studies in healthy  volunteers.  The current OLE study
 will 
allow the collection of long -term safety  data t o better assess the risk to benefit profile of 
upadacitinib.
In view of the COVID -19 pandemic, the benefit:risk profile of various 
immunomodulatory  therapies on COVID -19 is being evaluated.  At this time, the effects 
of upadacitinib on the course of COVID -19 are not well defined.
4.0 Study  Objective
The primary  objective is to evaluate the long -term safet y, tolerabilit y, and efficacy of 
upadacitinib in RA subjects who have completed Study  M13 -550 or Study  M13 -537 
Phase 2 RCT with upadacitinib.

5.0 Investigational Plan
5.1 Overall Study Design and Plan:  Description
This is a Phase 2, multicenter, OLE stud y to assess the long -term safety , tolerability , and 
efficacy  of upadacitinib in RA subjects who have completed Study M13- 550 or 
Study M13 -537 Phase 2 RCT with upadaciti nib.  This study  is designed to enroll up to 
500 subjects.  Subjects will be treated for approximately 312 weeks.
Only  those subjects who have met all of the specified inclusion criteria and none of the 
exclusion criteria will have an option to enter into the OLE study  to receive upadacitinib, 
as long as the subject is willing and the Investigator believes that continuing therap y with 
upadacitinib is appropriate.
All eligible subjects will be assigned to upadacitinib 6 mg BID immediately after or up to 
30days following the Last Visit (Week 12) of Study  M13 -550 or Study  M13 -537 Phase 2 
RCT.
Subjects who are unable to tolerate 6 mg BID will be discontinued from the study .
At Week 6, if a subject fails to achieve at least 20% improvement from RCT Baseline in 
both Tender Joint Count (TJC) and Swollen Joint Count (SJC), upadacitinib dose should 
be increased to 12 mg BID as long as the Investigator has no safet y concerns.  After 
6weeks of treatment with upadacitinib 12 mg BID, the improvement in TJC and SJC will 
be re -assessed at next scheduled visit (Week 12).
If the subject on 12 mg BID fails to achieve at least 20% improvement in both TJC and 
SJC from RCT Baseline the subject will be discontinued. 
At Week 12, the same process will be followed.  If a subject st ill on 6 mg BID fails to 
achieve at least 20% improvement from RCT Baseline in both TJC and SJC, upadacitinib 
dose should be increased to 12 mg BID.  The improvement in both TJC and SJC will be 
re-assessed after 6 weeks of treatment with 12 mg BID at Week 18 (an optional study  
visit).

EudraCT 2013 -003530 -33
29
Subjects who fail to achieve at least 20% improvement from RCT Baseline in both TJC 
and SJC with 12 mg BID at Week 18 will be discontinued. 
After Week 12, if a subject fails to show at least 20% improvement from RCT Baseline in 
both TJC and SJC at 2 consecutive scheduled study visits, the subject will be 
discontinued.
Starting at Week 6 and during an y scheduled or unscheduled visits thereafter, upadacitinib 
dose may  be increased from 6 mg BID to 12 mg BID (or 30 mg QD from January  2017, 
see below) if a subject fails to achieve Low Disease Activity  (LDA) status (defined b y 
CDAI  > 10) and has no safet y concerns per Investigator's judgment.
At any  visit, upadacitinib dose may  be decreased back to 6 mg BID (or 15 mg QD from 
January 2017) per Investigator's judgment if there are safet y and/or tolerability  concerns, 
due to an adverse event or reaching one of the protocol specific toxicity  management 
thresholds.  Dose increase back to 12 mg BID (or 30 mg QD from January  2017) is not 
allowed.
From January  2017, all subjects who are at Week 72 or bey ond will receive a once -daily  
tablet formulation.  Subjects who are on 6 mg BID capsule dosing will be transitioned to 
15 mg QD tablet dosing.  Subjects who are on 12 mg BID capsule dosing wil l be 
transitioned to 30 mg QD tablet dosing.  The capsule formulation will not be available to 
subjects once the transition to tablet formulation has occurred.
Starting with Amendment 5, subjects who are receiving 30 mg QD open -label 
upadacitinib will have the option to decrease the dose to 15 mg QD based on 
investigator's discretion.
The change to once daily tablet formulation in this study  is based on extrapolation of 
pre-clinical efficacy  models and anal yses of PK, pharmacod ynamic, safety , and efficacy  
data from the Phase 1 studies in healthy volunteers (single and multiple ascending dose 
Studies M13- 401 and M13 -845, respectively ) and completed Phase 2b randomized, 
controlled studies (RCTs) in RA subjects (Studies M13 -537 and M13 -550).  The doses

selecte d, 15 mg QD and 30 mg QD, are expected to approximate the exposures achieved 
with the 6 mg BID and 12 BID immediate release formulations, respectively, which 
should be efficacious with an acceptable safet y profile.  Preliminary results from an 
ongoing rela tive bioavailability  study  demonstrated that single 15 mg and 30 mg doses of 
the once- daily  formulation provide comparable AUC and significantly  lower C maxthan 
single doses of 12 mg immediate release (I R) formulation (AUC equivalent to 6 mg BID 
dose teste d in Phase 2) and 24 mg IR formulation (AUC equivalent to 12 mg BID dose 
tested in Phase 2), respectively , under fasting conditions.  At steady -state, the once -daily  
dose of 15 mg QD is predicted to achieve comparable dail y AUC and C max, and 
non-inferior C trough to 6 mg BID IR formulation.  In the Phase 2 RCTs, the 6 mg BID dose 
was shown to achieve the near maximum efficacy .  The once -daily dose of 30 mg QD is 
predicted to achieve comparable daily AUC and C max, and non -inferior C trough to 12 mg 
BID IR form ulation.  In the Phase 2 RCTs, the 12 mg BID dose was clearl y shown to 
achieve the plateau of efficacy .

5.2.4 Contraception Recommendations
Contraception Recommendation for Females
A woman who is postmenopausal or permanentl y surgically  sterile (bilateral 
oophorectomy, bilateral salpingectomy or h ysterectomy ) is not considered to be a woman 
of childbearing potenti al and is not required to follow contraception recommendations.  
Postmenopausal is defined as: 
Upadacitinib
M13 -538 Protocol Amendment 6
EudraCT 2013 -003530 -33
38
●Age ≥ 55 y ears with no menses for 12 or more months without an alternative 
medical cause; or
●Age < 55 years with no menses for 12 or more months without an alter native 
medical cause AND an FSH level > 40 m IU/mL.
A woman who does not meet the definition of postmenopausal or permanently  surgicall y 
sterile is considered of childbearing potential and is required to practice at least one of the 
following highly effective methods of birth control that is effective from Study  Day  1 (or 
earlier) through at least 30 days after the last dose of study drug.
●Combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception (oral, 
intravaginal, transdermal) associated with the inhibition of ovulation, initiated 
at least 1 month prior to Study  Day  1.
●Progestogen -only hormonal contraception (oral, injectable, implantable) 
associated with inhibition of ovulation, initiated at least 30 days prior to Study 
Day 1.
●Bilateral tubal occlusion/ligation.
●Vasectomized partner(s), provided the vasectomized partner has received 
medical confirmation of the surgical success and is the sole sexual partner of 
the women of childbearing potential trial participant.
●Intrauterine device (IUD).
●Intrauterine hormone -releasing s ystem (IUS).
●True abstinence:  Refraining from heterosexual intercourse when this is in line 
with the preferred and usual lifesty le of the subject (periodic abstinence 
[e.g., calendar, ovulation, sy mptothermal, post -ovulation methods] and 
withdrawal are not acceptable).
If required per local practices, male or female condom with or without spermicide OR 
cap, diaphragm or sponge with spermicide should be used in addition to one of the highly 
effective birth control methods list ed above (excluding true abstinence). 
Upadacitinib
M13 -538 Protocol Amendment 6
EudraCT 2013 -003530 -33
39
If, during the course of the study , a woman becomes surgicall y sterile or post -menopausal 
and complete documentation is available, contraception measures as defined above are no 
longer required.
Contraception Recommendation for Males
There are no contraception requirements for male subjects or their female partner(s).  
It is important to note that subjects taking concomitant csDMARDs (i.e., methotrexate, 
sulfasalazine, hy droxy chloroquine, chloroquine and leflunomide) the duration of 
contraception and requirement not to donate sperm after discontinuation of these 
prescribed csDMARDs should be based on the local label.

j. Adverse Events ending prior to first dose in Study M13 -538 will be recorded in preceding RCT trials.  Ongoing Adverse Events from preceding RCT trials after first dose in 
Study M13 -538 will be recorded in Study M13 -538.
k. For women of childbearing potent ial, urine pregnancy test will be performed monthly at home between scheduled study visits.  The results of these tests will be verbally 
communicated (via telephone) to the site.  If a urine pregnancy test is positive, the subject must stop dosing, come in to clinic and have blood drawn for a serum pregnancy 
test that will be analyzed at the central laboratory.  A urine pregnancy test will be performed at all scheduled study visits as specified in Table 2, on all female subjects of 
childbearing potential.  If urine pregnancy test (which is performed at the site) is negative, begin or continue dosing.  If urine pregnancy test is positive at any visit, withhold 
dosing and perform a serum pregnancy test for confirmation.  The serum pregnancy test will be sent to and performed by the ce ntral laboratory.  Pregnant subjects must be 
discontinued from the study.  In the event a pregnancy test comes back border line or indeterminate, a repeat test is required.
l. Fasting status for each subject should be documented in the source documents.  Fasting is NOT required for this study.
m. Blood samples for PK will be collected at any time during the visit, and preferably within 1 to 8 hours after the last dose.  The exact date, time and number of capsules of the 
last 2 doses of study drug taken prior to the pharmacokinetic sample collection will be recorded to the nearest minute starti ng with the dose prior to PK collec tion.

Due to a state of emergency  or pandemic situation like COVID -19, subject visits may  be 
conducted via phone or video conference.  In these situations, if a visit by  phone or video 
conference occurs at one of the designated stud y visits specified tocomplete phy sical 
examination, the complete phy sical examination will be performed at the next f easible 
visit.   A sy mptom -directed phy sical examination may  be performed at any visits when 
necessary .
Physician Global Assessment of Disease Activity Visual Analog Scale (VAS)
At visits specified in Table 2, the Phy sician will rate global assessment of subject's current 
disease activity  ranging from 0 to 100 independent of the subject's self -assessment 
(Appendix D) using the Visual Analog Scale, which consists of a horizontal 100 mm line 
anchored at either end b y opposite adjectives reflecting the spectrum/severity of the 
parameters assessed.
Due t o a state of emergency or pandemic situation like COVID -19, subject visits may  be 
conducted via phone or video conference. In these situations, the Phy sician Global 
Assessment of Disease Activity  will be completed by  the ph ysician at the next feasible 
visit.
Tender Joint Count (TJC) and Swollen Joint Count (SJC) Assessment
Tender Joint Count (TJC)
An assessment of 68 joints ( Appendix C) will be done for tenderness b y pressure 
manipulation on phy sical examination at visits specified in Table 2.  Joint pain/tenderness 
will be classified as:  present ("1"), absent ("0"), replaced ("9") or no assessment ("NA").
Swollen Joint Count (SJC)
An assessment of 66 joints ( Appendix C) will be done by directed ph ysical examination at 
visits specified in Table 2.  The joints to be examined for swelling are the same as those  
Upadacitinib
M13 -538 Protocol Amendment 6
EudraCT 2013 -003530 -33
52
examined for tenderness, except the hip joints are excluded.  Joint swelling will be 
classified as present ("1"), absent ("0"), replaced ("9") or no assessment ("NA").
If a patient receives an intra -articular injection during the stud y, the injected joint(s) 
should be scored as "NA = no assessment" for 90 days following injection.
If possible, the TJC and SJC should be performed by an independent joint assessor who 
should not perform an y other study  related procedures, as much as possible.  I n order to 
minimize variability , the same independent joint assessor should evaluate the subject at 
each visit for the duration of the trial.  A back- up independent assessor, who is trained and 
competent in performing such assessments, should be identified.  It is the responsibility  of 
the Principal Investigator to ensure all assessors are qualified to perform joint assessments 
and that all train ing is documented.  If the independent assessor is not available, the 
pre-identified back -up assessor will perform such assessments.
Due to a state of emergency  or pandemic situation like COVID -19, subject visits may  be 
conducted via phone or video confere nce.  In these situations, the TJC and SJC will be 
performed at the next feasible visit by the independent joint assessor, if possible.
Pregnancy Test
●For women of childbearing potential, urine pregnancy test will be performed 
monthly  at home between sched uled stud y visits.  The results of these tests will 
be verball y communicated (via telephone) to the site.  If a urine pregnancy test 
is positive, the subject must stop dosing, come in to clinic and have blood 
drawn for a serum pregnancy  test that will be a nalyzed at the central laboratory .  
A urine pregnancy  test will be performed at all scheduled study  visits as 
specified in Table 2, on all female subj ects of childbearing potential.  If urine 
pregnancy  test (which is performed at the site) is negative, begin or continue 
dosing.  If urine pregnancy  test is positive at any  visit, withhold dosing and 
perform a serum pregnancy  test for confirmation.  The se rum pregnancy  test 
will be sent to and performed by  the central laboratory.  Pregnant subjects must 
be discontinued from the study .  In the event a pregnancy  test comes back 
borderline, a repeat test is required. 
Upadacitinib
M13 -538 Protocol Amendment 6
EudraCT 2013 -003530 -33
53
At each visit, the study  staff should revi ew the pregnancy  avoidance recommendations 
with each subject of childbearing potential and male subjects with a partner of 
childbearing potential, and document this discussion in the subject's source records.
Female subjects who are either postmenopausal, defined as:
●Age ≥ 55 y ears with no menses for 12 or more months without an alternative 
medical cause; or
●Age < 55 years with no menses for 12 or more months without an alternative 
medical cause AND an FSH level > 40 IU/L.
and/or surgicall y sterile (bilate ral oophorectomy  or hy sterectom y) are exempt from 
pregnancy  testing.
In the event a urine pregnancy  test may not be performed at the protocol specified visits
due to study  modifications related a state of emergency  or pandemic situation like 
COVID- 19, it c an be performed b y subjects at a local laboratory or it is possible for the 
Investigator to arrange a shipment from the study  site directly  to the subject's home of 
urine pregnancy  test kits to have the urine pregnancy  test done at home (see 
Section 5.3.1.1 -Sub-Section "Study  Drug Dispensing, Dosing, and Compliance "for 
details). Home urine pregnancy  test should be performed monthly , regardless of ability  to 
obtain other laboratory  samples.
If, during the course of the study , a woman becomes surgicall y sterile or post -menopausal 
and complete documentation as described as above is available, pregnancy  testing will no 
longer be required.
A breastfeeding or pregnant female will not be eligible for participation or continuation in 
this study .

TB Testing
For subjects with a negative QuantiFERON -TB Gold (or PPD) test at screening of the 
preceding RC T, an annual QuantiFERON -TB Gold (or protein purified derivative [PPD]) 
re-test will be required at visits indicated in Table 2.  All subjects will be assessed for 
evidence of increased risk for TB b y a questionnaire ( Appendix L).
Subjects with a negative QuantiFERON®-TB Gold test OR negative PPD TB skin test 
AND no new evidence of increased TB risk based on the questionnaire may continue in 
the study .
Subjects with documentation of prior positive result of QuantiFERON -TB Gold Test (or 
equivalent) and/or PPD are not required to repeat either test d uring the study  and should 
be considered positive .
If the QuantiFERON -TB Gold test is indeterminate, the QuantiFERON -TB Gold test 
should be performed locally  (or through the central laboratory  if not locall y available) to 
rule out a positive test result.  If testing remains indeterminate or is positive, then the 
subject is considered to be positive for the purpose of this study.  If the local testing result 
is negative, then the patient is considered to be negative.
●Interpretation of a positive annual TB te st in low risk subjects:  I n cases where 
the QuantiFERON -TB Gold Plus test by  the central laboratory  is positive and 
the Investigator considers the subject at low risk for TB and has no clinical 
suspicion of TB, the Investigator may  perform a local QuantiF ERON -TB Gold 
Plus test (or repeat testing through the central laboratory  if not locall y 
available) to confirm the positive test result.  I f the repeat testing result is 
negative, the Investigator may  consider the test to be negative based on his/her 
clinic al judgment; if the repeat testing result is positive or indeterminate, the 
test is considered positive.
●An equivalent Interferon Gamma Release Assay  (IGRA) (such as T -SPOT TB 
test) may  be substituted for the QuantiFERON -TB Gold Plus. 
Upadacitinib
M13 -538 Protocol Amendment 6
EudraCT 2013 -003530 -33
55
If one of the annual tests has a positive test result (seroconversion), a chest x -ray (CXR) 
needs to be performed as soon as possible to aid in distinguishing active versus latent TB.  
Expert consultation can be considered per Investigator's discretion.  An y positive TB 
scree n after the patient has started the stud y should be reported as an adverse event (AE).
Subjects with evidence of active TB infection will be discontinued from the trial.
For subjects with seroconversion on anannual TB test, if a CXR cannot be done due to
state of emergency  or pandemic situation like COVID -19, the Investigator should contact 
the AbbVie TA MD to determine if the subject may continue on study drug.  CXR should 
be performed as soon as restrictions allow at the study site or local hospital/fac ility.   
If the subject is experiencing signs or s ymptoms suspicious for TB or something has 
changed in the subject's medical history to warrant a repeat test before the next scheduled 
annual TB re -test, the case must be discussed with the AbbVie Therapeu tic Area Medical 
Director.
Obtain a CXR for subjects with newly  identified positive PPD or QuantiFERON -TB Gold 
test and every  48 weeks for subjects with TB risk factors as determined b y the TB risk 
assessment form ( Appendix H) or for subjects living in areas endemic for TB.  An y 
positive TB test result after the subject has started study drug should be reported as an 
adverse event (AE).
The results of the TB test(s) will be retained at the site as the original source 
documentation.
TB Prophylaxis
If the subject has evidence of latent TB infection (newly positive TB test and the subject 
has a CXR not suggestive of active TB), proph ylactic treatment mu st be initiated (per 
local guidelines).  The prophy laxis needs to be completed.
Of note:  Rifampicin or rifapentine is not allowed for TB prophylaxis

QuantiFERON -TB Gold Test
QuantiFERON- TB Gold test will be performed at visits specified in Table 2.  The 
analyses will be performed by  a certified laboratory .
OR
TB Skin Test
A PPD skin test (alternatively, also known as a TB Skin Test) will be performed a s 
specified in Table 2according to standard clinical practice.  The TB Skin Test should be 
read b y a licensed healthcare professional between 48 and 72 hours after administration.  
A subject who does not return within 72 hours will need to be rescheduled for another 
skin test.  The reaction will be measured in millimeters (mm) of induration and induration 
equal to or greater than 5 mm for RA subjects i s considered a positive reaction.  The 
absence of induration will be recorded as "0 mm" not "negative."
Chest X- Ray (CXR)
A CXR (posterior -anterior and lateral views) is required at the visits indicated in Table 2
for those subjects with new TB risk factors per the latent TB risk factor questionnaire 
(Appendix L), or for those subjects living in areas endemic for TB or for those subjects 
with a newl y positive PPD or QuantiFERON -TB Gold.  Subjects can have a CXR any  
time during the stud y as warranted based on the opinion of the I nvestigator.
A radiol ogist must perform an assessment of the CXR.  The Principal Investigator will 
indicate the clinical significance of an y findings and will sign and date the report.  In the 
assessment of the CXR, the Principal Investigator or their delegate must indicate th e 
presence or absence of (1) calcified granulomas, (2) pleural scarring/thickening, and 
(3)signs of active TB.
Due to a state of emergency  or pandemic situation like COVID -19, subject visits may  be 
conducted via phone or video conference.  In these situat ions, if a visit requires  
Upadacitinib
M13 -538 Protocol Amendment 6
EudraCT 2013 -003530 -33
57
completion of a CXR , the CXR will be performed at the next earliest feasible visit , unless 
the Investigator has determined, based on clinical judgement, that a CXR is required to 
ensure that it is safe to continue study drug administration .In this case, CXR should be 
performed as soon as restrictions allow at the study site or local hospital/facility.   
12-Lead Electrocardiogram (ECG)
An ECG will be performed for all subjects at Weeks 0, 48, 96 and every 48 weeks 
afterward s (Wk 132, Wk 180, Wk 228 and Wk 276), until the end of the study  or as 
clinically indicated during the study .  An ECG may  be administered at any  time during the 
study  based on the opinion of the Investigator.
Due to a state of emergency  or pandemic situat ion like COVID -19, subject visits may  be 
conducted via phone or video conference.  In these situations, if a visit requires 
completion of an ECG, the ECG will be performed at the next earliest feasible visit, 
unless the Investigator has determined, based o n clinical judgement, that an ECG is 
required to ensure that it is safe to continue stud y drug administration. In this case, the 
ECG should be performed as soon as restrictions allow at the study  site or local 
hospital/facility .   
hsCRP
Blood samples for high-sensitivity  C-reactive protein (hsCRP) will be obtained at the time 
points specified in Table 2.
Pharmacokinetic (PK)
Blood collection will be pe rformed at the scheduled study  visits as specified in Table 2.
Clinical Laboratory Tests
Samples will be obtained at minimum for the clinical laborator y tests outlined in Table 3.  
A certified central laboratory will be utilized to process and provide results for the clinical  
Upadacitinib
M13 -538 Protocol Amendment 6
EudraCT 2013 -003530 -33
58
laboratory  tests.  All ab normal laboratory  tests that are considered clinically significant b y 
the investigator will be followed to a satisfactory resolution.
The central laboratory  chosen for this study  will provide instructions regarding the 
collection, processing and shipping of these samples.
The fasting status will be recorded in the study source documentation.
If travel restrictions or other changes in local regulations due to state of emergency  or 
pandemic situation like COVID -19prevent the subject from having blood drawn f or 
laboratory  testing at the study  site, it is possible for the Investigator to arrange for subjects 
to have laboratory  work done at a local lab, hospital, or other facility to ensure the safet y 
assessments are conducted per protocol. Local lab results sh ould be obtained along with 
reference ranges and kept within the subjects' source documentation.  L ocal lab results 
should be reviewed b y the investigator or designee as soon as possible and documented in 
the eCRF.
If laboratory  samples cannot be obtained, study  drug administration may  be continued 
provided labs have been obtained within the prior 3 months, the investigator has reviewed 
the laboratory  results and confirmed and discussed with the subject that there is no safet y 
concern for the subject to con tinue use of the study drug in the absence of current lab 
results.  The subject should be scheduled for laboratory draws as soon as feasible and no 
later than the next scheduled visit in order to continue the study drug administration.
If laboratory  results are not available within the prior 3 months/two consecutive 12 -week 
intervals, study  drug dispensation is not allowed until the required laboratory tests are 
completed to ensure the safet y assessments are conducted per protocol. 
Bloo d and samples will be obtained for the laboratory  tests as specified in Table 2.  Blood 
draws should be performed after all clinical assessments and qu estionnaires (HAQ- DI, 
Patient's Assessment of Pain, FACIT, etc.), and vital sign determinations are obtained and 
before stud y drug administration during a visit.

5.4 Removal of Subjects from Therapy  or Assessment
5.4.1 Discontinu ation of Individual Subjects
A subject may  withdraw from the study  at any  time.  The Investigator may  discontinue 
any subject's participation for an y reason, including an adverse event, safety concerns or 
failure to compl y with the protocol.
Subjects will be withdrawn from the stud y immediately if an y of the following occur:
●Clinically  significant abnormal laboratory  results or adverse events, which rule 
out continuation of the study  medication, as determined by  the Investigator and 
the AbbVie Therapeutic A rea Medical Director .
●Serious infections (e.g., sepsis) which would put the subject at risk for 
continued participation in the trial as determined by the Investigator in 
consultation with the AbbVie Therapeutic Area Medical Director .
●The Investigator belie ves it is in the best interest of the subject.
●The subject requests withdrawal from study  drug or the study . 
Upadacitinib
M13 -538 Protocol Amendment 6
EudraCT 2013 -003530 -33
67
●Inclusion and exclusion criteria violation was noted after the subject started 
study  drug, when continuation of the study  drug would place the subj ect at risk 
as determined b y the AbbVie Therapeutic Area Medical Director .
●Introduction of prohibited medications or dosages when continuation of the 
study  drug would place the subject at risk as determined by  the AbbVie SDP.
●Subject is non- compliant with TB proph ylaxis (if applicable) or develops active 
TB at an y time during the study.
●The subject becomes pregnant while on stud y medication.
●Subject has known malignancy , except for localized non -melanoma skin 
cancer.  Discontinuation for carcinoma in- situ o f the cervix is at the discretion 
of the Investigator.
●Subject is diagnosed with lupus -like sy ndrome, multiple sclerosis or 
demy elinating disease (including myelitis).
●Subject is significantl y non-compliant with study  procedures which would put 
the subject at risk for continued participation as determined by  the Investigator .
●Subject has failed to achieve at least 20% improvement from Baseline (RCT 
period) in TJC and SJC with upadacitinib as described in Section 5.1.
●Confirmed diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolus or 
non-cardiac, non- neurologic arterial thrombosis.
●Subject develops a gastrointestinal perforation (other than due to appendicitis 
or mechanical injury ).
If, during the course of study  drug administration, the subject prematurel y discontinues 
study  drug use, the procedures outlined for the premature discontinuation visit should be 
completed as soon as possible, preferabl y within 2 weeks of stud y drug discontinuation 
and preferabl y prior to the initiation of another therap y.  However, these procedures 
should not interfere with the initiation of any new treatments or therapeutic modalities that 
the Investigator feels are ne cessary  to treat the subject's condition.  Following 
discontinuation of the study  drug, the subject will be treated in accordance with the 
Investigator's best clinical judgment. 
Upadacitinib
M13 -538 Protocol Amendment 6
EudraCT 2013 -003530 -33
68
A final visit (a telephone call is sufficient if a site visit is not possible) will occur for all 
subjects participating in the OLE stud y, approximately 30 days after the last dose of study  
medication to determine the status of an y ongoing AEs/SAEs or the occurrence of an y 
new AEs/SAEs.
During the COVID- 19 pandemic, it has been necessary  to employ  mitigation strategies to 
enable the Investigator to ensure subject safet y and continuity of care. 
During a state of emergency  or pandemic situation like COVID -19,the Investigator 
should contact the sponsor TAM D before discontinuing a subject from the study or stud y 
drug for a reason other than "planned per protocol," to ensure all acceptable mitigation 
steps have been explored.
All attempts must be made to determine the date of the last study  drug dose and the 
primary  reason for premature discontinuation.  The information will be recorded on the 
appropriate eCRF page.
For subjects that are considered lost to follow -up, reasonable attempts must be made to 
obtain information on the final status of the subject.  At a minimum, two phone calls must 
be made and one certified letter must be sent and documented in the subject's source 
documentation.
Subjects who discontinue the study  prematurel y will not be replaced.
5.4.2 Discontinuation of Entire Study
AbbVie may  terminate t his study  prematurel y, either in its entirety or at an y study  site, for 
reasonable cause provided that written notice is submitted in advance of the intended 
termination.  The investigator may  also terminate the study  at his/her site for reasonable 
cause, after providing written notice to AbbVie in advance of the intended termination.  
Advance notice is not required by either part y if the study is stopped due to safet y 
concerns.  If AbbVie terminates the study for safety reasons, AbbVie will immediately  
Upadacitinib
M13 -538 Protocol Amendment 6
EudraCT 2013 -003530 -33
69
notify the investigator b y telephone and subsequently  provide written instructions for 
study  termination.
5.5 Treatments
5.5.1 Treatments A dministered
Treatments administered during this OLE include upadacitinib 6 mg BID, 12 mg BID, 
(15mg QD or 30 mg QD from January  2017).  All subjects start treatment with 6 mg 
BID.  Dose adjustments are allowed as described in Section 5.1.
Subject receiving 6 mg BID will dose with two 3 mg capsules twice a day .
Subjects receiving 12 mg BID will dose with one 12 mg capsule twice a day.
Subject receiving 15 mg QD will dose with one 15 mg tablet once a day .
Subject receiving 30 mg QD will dose with one 30 mg tablet once a day .
Study drug will be taken orally beginning at Baseline/Week 0 in OL E.  Subjects will be 
instructed to take study  drug at approximately the same times each day .  The study  drug 
can be taken with or without food.  Subjects will continue their weekl y stable dose o f 
MTX and folic acid.  AbbVie will not supply  MTX or folic acid.
If a subject is unable to come to the study  site to pick up their study  drug due to state of 
emergency  or an y pandemic like COVID- 19, a direct -to-patient (DTP) study  drug 
shipment can be made from the study  site to the subject if allowed b y local regulations.  
AbbVie will submit any  required notifications to the regulatory  authority  as applicable.  
Refer to Section 5.3.1.1 for details on DTP shipment of study  drug.

5.5.1.1 Packaging and Labeling
Upadacitinib will be packaged in bottles containing 100 capsules or 100 tablets per bottle.  
Each bottle (kit) label will contain a unique kit number.  This kit number is assigned to a 
subject via IRT and encodes the appropriate stud y drug to be dispensed at the subject's 
corresponding stud y visit.  Each kit will be labeled as required per country requirements.
Labels must remain affixed to the bottles (kits) and must not be concealed by  any 
over-labeling.  All blank spaces on the label will be completed b y site staff prior to 
dispensing to the subjects.
5.5.1.2 Storage and Disposition of Study Drugs
The study  drug must be stored at controlled room temperature (15° to 25°C/59° to 77°F).  
The investigational products are for investigational use only  and are to be used only  
within the context of this study .  The study drug supplied for this study must be 
maintained under adequate security and stored under the conditions specified on the label 
until dispensed f or subject use or returned to AbbVie.
5.5.2 Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups
This is an open -label study .  The upadacitinib treatment is the same for all subjects so that 
there is no assignment of subjects to treatment groups.  As a subject is co nfirmed for 
Baseline (Week 0) in OLE to be appropriate for participation in the study, the site will  
Upadacitinib
M13 -538 Protocol Amendment 6
EudraCT 2013 -003530 -33
71
enter the subject's number from Study M13 -550 or Study  M13 -537, based on which study  
the subject was enrolled in, into I VRS (Interactive Voice Response S ystem)/I WRS 
(Interactive Web based Response Sy stem) to obtain study  drug.  All eligible subjects will 
be assigned to upadacitinib 6 mg BID immediately after or up to 30 day s following the 
Last Visit (Week 12) of Study M13 -550 or Study  M13 -537 using an Intera ctive Voice 
Response Sy stem/Interactive Web Response Sy stem (IVRS/I WRS).  Before the study  is 
initiated, the telephone number and call -in directions for the IVRS/IWRS will be provided 
to each site.  From Week 6 in OL E, subjects will receive subsequent trea tment as 
described in Section 5.5.1 .
5.5.3 Selection and Timing of Dose for Each Subject
Subjects should take study drug as outlined in Section 5.5.1.
On scheduled study visit days, subject should follow their regular routine for study drug 
administration.
Each subject's dosing schedule should be clo sely monitored by  the site at each study  visit 
by careful review of the subject's dosing diary  (Appendix K).
Capsule Formulation:
If a subject should forget to take his/her study drug dose at his/her regularly scheduled 
dosing time, he/she should take the forgotten dose as soon as he/she remembers the dose 
was missed as long as it is at least 6 hours before his/her next scheduled dose.  If a subject 
only remembers the missed dose within 6 hours before next scheduled dose, the subject 
should skip the missed dose and take the next dose at the schedul ed time.  
Tablet Formulation:
If a subject should forget to take his/her study drug dose at his/her regularly scheduled 
dosing time, he/she should take the forgotten dose as soon as he/she remembers the dose 
was missed as long as it is at least 10 hours before their next scheduled dose.  If a subject  
Upadacitinib
M13 -538 Protocol Amendment 6
EudraCT 2013 -003530 -33
72
only remembers the missed dose within 10 hours before next scheduled dose, the subject 
should skip the missed dose and take the next dose at the scheduled time.
If the subject experiences a study  drug interrup tion > 30 day s, they  should notify  their 
investigator, and the investigator will determine if study  drug should be restarted or if the 
subject should be discontinued from the study.
Subjects who, in the opinion of the Investigator, develop adverse events t hat require stud y 
drug interruption and/or reach protocol specified toxicity  management thresholds can 
have the stud y drug interrupted for up to 30 days while recovering from the adverse event.
5.5.4 Blinding
This is an open -label study .
5.5.5 Treatment Compliance
Theinvestigator or his/her designated and qualified representatives will 
administer/dispense study drug onl y to subjects enrolled in the study in accordance with 
the protocol.  The stud y drug must not be used for reasons other than that described in the 
protocol.
Subject dosing will be recorded on a subject dosing diary ( Appendix K).  Subjects will be 
instructed to return all drug containers (even if e mpty ) to the stud y site personnel at each 
clinic visit.  The study  site personnel will document compliance in the study source 
documents.  Subjects will be counseled on missed doses of medication.  If the subject 
does not return the dosing diary, used and unused study  drug bottles the site should 
question the subject and obtain as much information as possible as to the dosing of the 
study  drug.
The information should be documented on the source documents as per "best recollection" 
and when possible, re -verified when the dosing diary  is returned before completing on the 
applicable eCRF page.

73
5.5.6 Drug A ccountability
The Investigator or his/her representative will verify that stud y drug supplies are received 
intact and in the correct amounts.  This will be document ed by  signing and dating the 
Proof of Receipt or similar document and b y registering the arrival of medication through 
the IRT.  The original Proof of Receipt Note and the faxed I RT confirmation sheet will be 
kept in the site files as a record of what was received.
In addition, an I RT will be used to document investigational product accountability  
including but not limited to date received, the lot number, kit number(s), date dispensed, 
subject number and the identification of person dispensing the drug.
All empty /used study  drug packaging will be inventoried by  the site.  Empty /used study  
drug packaging should be returned b y the subject at each visit for accountability  and 
compliance purposes and new packaging issued as necessary .  Site staff will complete 
study  drug accountabilit y via I RT by  using source documents, subject dosing diaries, and 
by visually inspecting the packaging whenever possible.  After drug accountability  and 
monitor reconciliation has been completed, used packaging and unused study drug will be 
destroy ed on site according to local procedures or regulations or returned to the 
destruction depot (for those sites that do not meet AbbVie's documentation requirements 
for on -site destruction).  The use of a third part y vendor for drug destructio n must be 
preapproved b y AbbVie.  For sites performing on -site drug destruction or using a third
party  vendor for drug destruction, a cop y of the destruction methodology and date of 
destruction should be maintained at the site's facility .
Monitors will rec oncile the site's processes, source documents, subject's dosing diaries, 
IRT or site accountability records, and destruction records to assure site compliance.
5.6 Discussion and Justification of Study  Design
Subjects who have completed Study  M13 -550 or Study  M13 -537 RCT with upadacitinib 
will be allowed to enroll in the OL E study  to continue to receive upadacitinib for up to 
approximately  312 weeks.  The primary objective of OLE study  is to collect long -term  
Upadacitinib
M13 -538 Protocol Amendment 6
EudraCT 2013 -003530 -33
74
safet y and tolerability data for upadacitinib.  All subjects who roll over into the OLE will 
be assigned to upadacitinib 6 mg BID initially, regardless of treatment assignment during 
RCT period, and the basis of this design is to preserve the blinding of treatment 
assignment in the RCT period.  All subjects assigned to 6 mg BID initially will have an 
option to increase the dose to 12 mg BID (or 30 mg QD from January  2017) throughout 
the treatment period if a subject is unable to achieve low disease activity with upadacitinib 
6 mg BID.  At an y time during the treatment period, the upadacitinib dose can be 
decreased back to 6 mg BID (or 15 mg QD from January  2017) per Investigator's 
judgment if there are safety  and tolerability  concerns.  Those subjects who are unable to 
achieve at least 20% improvement in both SJC and TJC (minimum clinical efficacy ) at 
defined time -points will be permanently  discontinued.  This design allows for collection 
of long -term safety  data and avoids continued treatment of those subjects who do not 
respond to study  medication.
From Janu ary 2017, all subjects who are at Week 72 or beyond will receive once -daily 
tablet formulation (15 mg QD or 30 mg QD).  Preliminary  results of a bioequivalent study  
demonstrated that single 15 mg and 30 mg doses of the once -daily formulation provide 
compar able AUC, but significantly  lower C maxthan single doses of 12 mg immediate 
release (IR) formulation (equivalent to 6 mg BID dose) and 24 mg IR formulation 
(equivalent to 12 mg BID dose), respectivel y.  At steady -state, the once -daily  dose of 
15mg QD is p redicted to achieve comparable daily  AUC, lower or comparable C max, and 
comparable C trough to 6 mg BID IR formulation, and the once -daily  dose of 30 mg QD is 
predicted to be equivalent to 12 mg BID IR.
Subjects who are on 6 mg BID (IR) capsule dosing will be transitioned to 15 mg QD 
tablet dosing.  Subjects who are on 12 mg BID dosing will be transitioned to 30 mg QD 
dosing.  Capsule formulation will not be available to the subjects after transition to tablet 
formulation.
Starting with Amendment 5, subjects who are receiving 30 mg QD open -label 
upadacitinib will have the option to decrease to the 15 mg QD dose based on 
investigator's discretion.

5.6.1 Appropriateness of Measurements
Standard statistical, clinical, and laboratory  procedures will be utilized in this study .  All 
efficacy  measurements in this study  are standard for assessing disease activity  in subjects 
with RA.  All clinical and laboratory  procedures in this study  are standard and generally  
accepted.
5.6.2 Suitability  of Subject Population
This OL E study  will enroll subjects who have completed Study M13 -550 or 
Study M13 -537 RCT with upadacitinib.  Only  those subjects who have met all of the 
specified inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria will have an option to enter into the 
OLE study  to receive upada citinib, as long as the subject is willing and the Investigator 
believes that continuing the therap y with upadacitinib is appropriate.
5.6.3 Selection of Doses in the Study
All subjects will be assigned to upadacitinib 6 mg BID at the beginning of OL E study .  
During the course of OLE treatment period the upadacitinib dose can be increased to 
12mg BID based on clinical efficacy  assessment and as long as the Investigator has no 
safet y concerns.  From January 2017, all subjects who are at Week 72 or beyond will 
receive once -daily tablet formulation.  Subjects who are on 6 mg BID dosing will be 
transitioned to 15 mg QD dosing.  Subjects who are on 12 mg BID dosing will be 
transitioned to 30 mg QD dosing.  The capsule formulation will not be available to 
subjects once the transition to tablet formulation has occurred.
The change in dose selection in this study  is based on extrapolation of pre -clinical 
efficacy  models and analy ses of PK, pharmacodynamic, safet y, and efficacy data from the 
Phase 1 studies in healthy volu nteers (single and multiple ascending dose 
Studies M13- 401 and M13 -845, respectively ) and completed Phase 2b randomized, 
controlled studies (RCTs) in RA subjects (Studies M13 -537 and M13 -550).  The doses 
selected, 15 mg QD and 30 mg QD, are expected to app roximate the exposures achieved 
with the 6 mg BID and 12 BID immediate release formulations, respectively, which  
Upadacitinib
M13 -538 Protocol Amendment 6
EudraCT 2013 -003530 -33
76
should be efficacious with an acceptable safet y profile.  Preliminary results from an 
ongoing relative bioavailability  study  demonstrated that single 15 mg and 30 mg doses of 
the once- daily  formulation provide comparable AUC and significantly  lower C maxthan 
single doses of 12 mg immediate release (I R) formulation (AUC equivalent to 6 mg BID 
dose tested in Phase 2) and 24 mg IR formulation (AUC equivalent to 12 mg BID dose 
tested in Phase 2), respectively , under fasting conditions.  At steady -state, the once -daily  
dose of 15 mg QD is predicted to achieve comparable dail y AUC and C max, and 
non-inferior C trough to 6 mg BID IR formulation.  In the Phase 2 RCTs, the 6 mg BID dose 
was shown to achieve the near maximum efficacy .  The once -daily dose of 30 mg QD is 
predicted to achieve comparable daily AUC and C max, and non -inferior C trough to 12 mg 
BID IR formulatio n.  In the Phase 2 RCTs, the 12 mg BID dose was clearl y shown to 
achieve the plateau of efficacy .
Study  drug will be given for approximately  312 weeks and will not exceed a dose of 
30mg dail y.

6.3 Definitions
6.3.1 Adverse Event
An adverse event (AE) is defined as an y untoward medical occurrence in a patient or 
clinic al investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not 
necessarily  have a causal relationship with this treatment.  An adverse event can therefore 
be an y unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding),
symptom, or disease temporally  associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) 
product, whether or not the event is considered causally related to the use of the product.
Such an event can result from use of the drug as stipulated in the protocol or labeling, as 
well as from accidental or intentional overdose, drug abuse, or drug withdrawal.  An y 
worsening of a pre -existing condition or illness is considered an adverse event.  
Worsening in severity  of a reported adverse event should be reported as a new adverse 
event.  Laboratory  abnormalities and changes in vital signs are considered to be adverse 
events only  if they  result in discontinuation from the study , necessitate therapeutic 
medical intervention, (meets protocol specific criteria [see Secti on 6.10 regarding toxicity  
management]) and/or if the investigator considers them to be adverse events.
An elective surgery /procedure scheduled to occur during a stud y will not be considered an 
adverse event if the surgery /procedure is being performed for a pre -existing condition and  
Upadacitinib
M13 -538 Protocol Amendment 6
EudraCT 2013 -003530 -33
78
the surgery /procedure has been pre -planned prior to study  entry .  However, if the 
pre-existing condition deteriorates unexpectedl y during the study (e.g., surgery performed 
earlier than planned), then the deterioration of the condition for which the elective 
surgery /procedure is being done will be considered an adverse event.
6.3.2 Serious A dverse Events
If an adverse event mee ts any  of the following criteria, it is to be reported to AbbVie as a 
serious adverse event (SAE) within 24 hours of the site being made aware of the serious 
adverse event.
Death of Subject An event that results in the death of a subject.
Life-Threatening An event that, in the opinion of the investigator, would have 
resulted in immediate fatality  if medical intervention had not 
been taken.  This does not include an event that would have 
been fatal if it had occurred in a more severe form.
Hospitalization or 
Prolongation of 
HospitalizationAn event that results in an admission to the hospital for an y 
length of time or prolongs the subject's hospital stay.  This 
does not include an emergency  room visit or admission to an 
outpatient facility .
Congenital Anom aly An anomaly detected at or after birth, or an y anomaly that 
results in fetal loss.
Persistent or 
Significant 
Disability/IncapacityAn event that results in a condition that substantially 
interferes with the activities of daily living of a study subject.  
Disability  is not intended to include experiences of relativel y 
minor medical significance such as headache, nausea, 
vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma 
(e.g., sprained ankle).

Important Medical 
Event Requiring 
Medical or Surgic al 
Intervention to 
Prevent Serious 
OutcomeAn important medical event that may  not be immediately  
life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization, but 
based on medical judgment may  jeopardize the subject and 
may require medical or surgical intervent ion to prevent an y 
of the outcomes listed above (i.e., death of subject, 
life-threatening, hospitalization, prolongation of 
hospitalization, congenital anomal y, or persistent or 
significant disability /incapacity ).  Additionally , any  elective 
or spontaneous abortion or stillbirth is considered an 
important medical event.  Examples of such events include 
allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an 
emergency  room or at home, blood dy scrasias or convulsions 
that do not result in inpatient hospitalization, or the 
development of drug dependency or drug abuse.
For serious adverse events with the outcome of death, the date and cause of death will be 
recorded on the appropriate case report form.
6.4 Adverse Events of Special Interest
The following AEs of special interest will be monitored during the study  (see detailed 
toxicity  management in Section 6.10):
●Serious infections, opportunistic infection s, herpes zoster, and active TB;
●Malignancy (all t ypes) ;
●Adjudicated Gastrointestinal perforations;
●Adjudicated c ardiovascular events (e.g., major adverse cardiovascular event 
[MACE]);

●Adjudicated cardiac, e mbolic and thrombotic events (non -cardiac, non- CNS).
6.5 Adverse Event Severity
The Investigator will classify  adverse events according to the Rheumatology  Common 
Toxicity  Criteria v.2.0 ( Appendix M).10
6.6 Relationship to Study Drug
The investigator will use the following definitions to assess the relationship of the adverse 
event to the use of stud y drug:
Reasonable 
Poss ibilityAfter consideration of factors including timing of the event, 
biologic plausibility , clinical judgment, and potential alternative 
causes, there is sufficient evidence (information) to suggest a 
causal relationship. 
No Reasonable 
PossibilityAfter consideration of factors including timing of the event, 
biologic plausibility , clinical judgment, and potential alternative 
causes, there is insufficient evidence (information) to suggest a 
causal relationship.
For causality  assessments, events assessed as having a reasonable possibility  of being 
related to the stud y drug will be considered "associated."  Events assessed as having no 
reasonable possibility  of being related to study  drug will be considered "not associated."  
In addition, when the investig ator has not reported a relationship or deemed it not 
assessable, AbbVie will consider the event associated.
If an investigator's opinion of no reasonable possibility  of being related to study  drug is 
given, an Other cause of event must be provided by the investigator for the serious 
adverse event.
6.7 Adverse Event Collection Period
All adverse events reported from the time of stud y drug administration (Day 1) until 
30days following discontinuation of study  drug administration will be collected, whether  
Upadacitinib
M13 -538 Protocol Amendment 6
EudraCT 2013 -003530 -33
81
solic ited or spontaneously reported b y the subject.  I n addition, serious adverse events will 
be collected from the time the subject signed the study -specific informed consent.
Adverse event information will be collected as shown in Figure 2, and recorded on the 
appropriate eCRFs.

6.9 Pregnancy
Pregnancy  in a study  subject or the partner of an enrolled subject must be reported to 
AbbVie within 24 hours after the site becom esaware of the pregnancy .  Subjects who 
become pregnant during the study  must be discontinued (Section 5.4.1 ).
Information regarding a pregnancy  occurrence in a study  subject and the outcome of the 
pregnancy  will be collected after obtaining proper consent.
Pregnancy  in a stud y subject is not considered an adverse event.  However, the medical 
outcome of an elective or spontaneous abortion, stillbirth or congenital anomaly is 
considered a serious adverse event and must be reported to AbbVie within 24 hours of the 
site becoming aware of t he event.
Subjects should avoid pregnancy  throughout the course of the study , starting with the 
Screening Visit through 30 days after the last study drug administration.  Results of a 
positive pregnancy  test or confirmation of a pregnancy  will be assessed starting with the 
Screening Visit through the final study visit.
6.10 Toxicity  Management
The toxicity  management of the AEs including AEs of special interest consists of safet y 
monitoring (review of AEs on an ongoing basis, and periodical/ad hoc review of safety  
issues by  a safet y data monitoring committee), interruption of stud y drug dosing with 
appropriate clinical management if applicable, and discontinuation of the subjects from 
study  drug.  The management of specific AEs and laboratory  parameters is descri bed 
below.
Serious Infections:   Subjects should be closely monitored for the development of signs 
and sy mptoms of infection during and after treatment with study  drug.  Study  drug should 
be interrupted if a subject develops a serious infection or a serious opportunistic infection.  
A subject who develops a new infection during treatment with study drug should undergo 
prompt diagnostic testing appropriate for an immunocompromised subject.  As  
Upadacitinib
M13 -538 Protocol Amendment 6
EudraCT 2013 -003530 -33
85
appropriate, antimicrobial therap y should be initiated, and the su bject should be closel y 
monitored.  Study  drug may  be restarted once the infection has been successfully  treated.  
If study  drug administration is interrupted for more than 30 day s, the subject should be 
discontinued from the study .  Subjects who develop a ctive tuberculosis must be 
permanentl y discontinued from study drug.
COVID -19:  Interrupt study  drug in subjects with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID -19.  
Consider interrupting study  drug in subjects with signs and/or s ymptoms and suspicion of 
COVID- 19.  The COVID -19 eCRF must be completed.
Herpes zoster:   If a subject develops herpes zoster, consider temporaril y interrupting 
study  drug until the episode resolves.
Gastrointestinal Perforation:   If the diagnosis of gastrointestinal perforation is 
confirmed, ( other than appendicitis or mechanical injury ) the subject must be discontinued 
from study  drug.
Cardiovascular Events:   Subjects presenting with potential cardiovascular events should 
be appropriatel y assessed and carefull y monitored.  These events will be reviewed and 
adjudicated b y an independent Cardiovascular Adjudication Committee in a blinded 
manner.
Thrombosis Events: Subjects who develop s ymptoms of thrombosis should be promptly  
evaluated and treated appropriatel y.  If the diagnosis of deep vein th rombosis, pulmonary  
embolus or non- cardiac, non -neurologic arterial thrombosis is confirmed, the subject 
should be discontinued.  
Malignancy:   Subjects who develop malignancy other than NMSC or carcinoma in situ 
of the cervix must be discontinued from stu dy drug.  Information including 
histopathological results should be queried for the confirmation of the diagnosis.  Periodic 
skin examination is recommended for subjects who are at increased risk for skin cancer. 
Upadacitinib
M13 -538 Protocol Amendment 6
EudraCT 2013 -003530 -33
86
Muscle -related symptoms:   If a subject expe riences s ymptoms suggestive of my ositis or 
rhabdom yolysis consider checking CPK and aldolase, with clinical management and/or 
study  drug interruption as deemed appropriate b y the treating ph ysician.
ECG Abnormality: Subjects must be discontinued from stud y drug for an ECG change 
considered clinically  significant and with reasonable possibility  of relationship to study  
drug OR a confirmed absolute QTcF value > 500 msec.
Management of Select Laboratory Abnormalities:  For an y given laboratory 
abnormality , the Investigator should assess the subject, appl y the standard of care for 
medical evaluation and treatment, following an y local guidelines.  Specific toxicity  
management guidelines for abnormal laboratory  values are described in Table 5
(confirmation b y repeat testing is required) and may require an appropriate supplemental 
eCRF to be completed.  All abnormal laboratory tests that are considered clinically 
significant b y the Investigator will be followed to a satisfactory resolution.  If a repeat test 
is required per Table 5, the repeat testing must occur as soon as possi ble.

Hemoglobin  If hemoglobin < 8 g/dL, interrupt study drug dosing and confirm by repeat testing 
with new sample.
 If hemoglobin decreases ≥ 3.0 g/dL from baseline without an alternative etiology, 
interrupt study drug dosing and confirm by repeat testing with new sample. 
 If hemoglobin decreases ≥ 3.0 g/dL from baseline and an alternative etiology is 
known, the subject may remain on study drug at the investigator's discretion.
 If confirmed, continue to withhold study drug until hemoglobin value returns to 
normal reference range or its baseline value.
Absolute neutrophil 
count (ANC) If confirmed < 1,000/µL, interrupt study drug dosing until ANC value returns to 
normal reference range or its Baseline value.
 Discontinue study drug if confirmed < 500/µL by repeat testing with new sample.
Absolute lymphocytes 
counts (ALC) If confirmed < 500/µL by repea t testing with new sample, interrupt study drug 
dosing until ALC returns to normal reference range or its Baseline value.

Laboratory Parameter Toxicity Management Guideline
AST or ALT  Interrupt study drug immediately if confirmed ALT or AST > 3 × ULN by repe at 
testing with new sample and either a total bilirubin > 2 × ULN or an international 
normalized ratio > 1.5. 
oA separate blood sample for INR testing will be needed to measure INR at the 
time of repeat testing for ALT or AST.  A repeat test of INR is not needed for 
determination if above toxicity management criteria are met. 
 Interrupt study drug immediately if co nfirmed ALT or AST > 3 × ULN by repeat 
testing with new sample along with appearance of fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right 
upper quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, rash, and/or eosinophilia (> 5%).  
 Interrupt study drug immediately if confirmed ALT or AST > 5 × ULN by repeat 
testing with new sample for more than 2 weeks. 
 IfALT or AST > 8 × ULN , interrupt study drug immediately, confirm by repeat 
testing with a new sample and contact the TAMD . 
Subjects who meet any of the above criteria should be evaluated for an alternative 
etiology of the ALT or AST elevation and managed as medically appropriate.  If 
applicable, the alternative etiology should be documented in the eCRF.  If ALT or AST 
values r eturn to the normal reference range or its Baseline value, study drug may be 
restarted.  If restarting study drug, documentation should include reason that rechallenge 
is expected to be safe.  If after clinically appropriate evaluation, no alternative etio logy 
for ALT or AST elevation is found or the ALT or AST elevation has not resolved or is 
not trending down toward normal, the subject should be discontinued from study drug 
 For subjects with HBc Ab+ (irrespective of HBs Ab status) and negative HBV 
DNA at screening who develop the following should have HBV DNA by PCR 
testing performed within one week: 
oALT > 5 × ULN OR
oALT or AST > 3 × ULN if an alternative cause is not readily identified.  
 A positive result for HBV DNA PCR testing in these subjects will require 
immediate interruption of study drug and a hepatologist consultation should occur 
within one week for recommendation regarding subsequent treatment.  
For any confirmed ALT or AST elevations > 3 ULN, complete supplemental hepatic 
eCRF.

Serum Creatinine  If serum creatinine is > 1.5 × the baseline value and >ULN, repeat the test for 
serum creatinine (with subject in an euvolemic state) to confirm the results.  If the 
results of the repeat testing still meet this criterion, then interrupt study drug and re -
start study drug once serum creatinine returns to ≤ 1.5 × baseline value and ≤ ULN
 If confirmed serum creatinine ≥ 2 mg/dL, interrupt study drug and re -start study 
drug once serum creatinine returns to normal reference range or its baseline value.
 For the above serum creatinine elevation scenarios, complete supplemental renal 
eCRF.
Creatine Phosphokinase  If confirmed CPK value ≥ 4 × ULN and there are no symptoms suggestive of 
myositis or rhabdomyolysis, the subjects may continue study drug at the 
investigator's discretion.
 If CPK ≥ 4 × ULN accompanied by symptoms suggestive of myositis or 
rhabdomyolysis, interrupt study drug and contact AbbVie Therapeutic Area 
Medical Director.
 For the above CPK elevation scenarios, complete supplemental CPK eCRF.
* Local requirements may apply.  Refer to Appendix Nfor local requirements (United Kingdom).
If the subject must undergo elective surgery , the study  drug should be interrupted at least 
1 week prior to the surgery .  If the subj ect must undergo emergency  surgery , the study  
drug should be interrupted at the time of the surgery.  The stud y drug can recommence 
once the ph ysician has examined the surgical site and determined that it has healed and 
there is no sign of infection.
6.11 Cardi ovascular A djudication Committee
An independent committee of ph ysician experts in cardiovascular adjudication will be 
utilized to assess cardiovascular and e mbolic and thrombotic (non -cardiac, non -CNS)
adverse events as defined by  the Cardiac Adjudication Committee charter.

○Work I nstability  Scale for RA (RA -WIS), 
○EuroQoL -5D (EQ -5D).
The proportion of subjects achieving Low Disease Activity  (LDA) o r Clinical Remission 
(CR), and the proportion of subjects achieving CR will be evaluated at Weeks 6, 12, 24, 
36, 48, 60, 72, 84, 96 and every 24 weeks thereafter until the end of the study.  The 
criteria will be based on DAS28 [CRP] or CDAI  as follows:
DAS28 [CRP] CDAI
LDA 2.6 ≤ to < 3.2 2.8 < to ≤ 10
CR < 2.6 ≤ 2.8
DAS28 [CRP] score will be determined based on a continuous scale of combined 
measures of TJC, SJC, Patient's Global Assessment of Disease Activity  (PtGA) (in mm), 
and hsCRP (in mg/L ).
DAS28 [CRP] = 0.56 √("TJC28" )+ 0.28 √("SJC28" )+ 0.36 ln (CRP + 1) +
0.014 PtGA + 0.96,
where √ is square root and ln is natural log.  A score > 5.1 generally means high disease 
activity ; 2.6 ≤ DAS28 [CRP] < 3.2 generally  means low disease activity  (LDA); DAS28 
[CRP] < 2.6 is generall y considered clinical remission (CR).
Clinical Disease Activity I ndex (CDAI) is a composite index (without CRP) for assessing 
disease activity .  CDAI is based on the simple summation of the counts of SJC28 and 
TJC28 along with Patient's Global Assessment (VAS [0 – 10 cm]) (PtGA) and Physician's 
Global Assessment (VAS [0 –10 cm]) (PhGA) for estimating disease activity.
CDAI  = TJC28 + SJC28 + PtGA + PhGA.

In this stud y, the level of disease activity is interpreted as remission (CDAI ≤ 2.8), low 
(2.8 < CDAI ≤ 10), moderate (10 < CDAI ≤ 22), or high (CDAI > 22).
8.1.5.2 Efficacy  Analysis 
The efficacy  anal yses will be conducted with the analy sis set described in Section 8.1.1
andthe observed cases (OC).  The OC anal ysis will not impute values for missing 
evaluations, and thus a subject who does not have an evaluation on a scheduled visit will 
be excluded from the OC anal ysis for that visit. 
Frequencies and relative frequencies ( percentages) of ACR20/50/70 will be summarized 
with 95% confidence intervals at each post -baseline time point.  
The proportion of subjects achieving Low Disease Activity  (LDA) or Clinical Remission 
(CR), and the proportion of subjects achieving CR will be evaluated at Weeks 6, 12, 24, 
36, 48, 60, 72, 84, 96 and every 24 weeks thereafter until the end of the study.  
Frequencies and relative frequencies will be reported with 95% confidence intervals by 
visit, and will be summarized based on DAS28 [CRP] and C DAI criteria respectively .
For each of the change from baseline measurement, namely, TJC, SJC, Patient's Global 
Assessment of Disease Activity , Phy sician's Global Assessment of Disease Activity , 
Patient's Assessment of Pain (VAS), HAQ -DI, hsCRP, DAS28 [CRP] disease activit y 
score, and CDAI, the mean, standard deviation, median, and range will be reported at each 
post-baseline time point.  For Patient Reported Outcomes variables including change from 
baseline anal yses of FACIT, RA- WIS, and EQ- 5D, the mea n, standard deviation, median 
and range will be summarized by  visit.  Confidence intervals at an overall level of 95% 
will be provided.
The impact of time between completion of RCT and roll -over to OLE will be explored.

8.1.6 Safety  Analysis
8.1.6.1 General Considerations
All subjects who receive at least one dose of upadacitinib in this OL E study  will be 
included in the safet y analy sis.  Incidence of adverse events, serious adverse events, 
premature discontinuation, and changes from Baseline in vital signs, ph ysical examination 
results, and clinical laboratory values will be analyzed b y visit.  Treatment -emergent 
adverse events will be tabulated by s ystem organ class and by  MedDRA preferred term.  
Mean change from Baseline for laborat ory and vital signs data will be summarized by  
visit.  For anal yses purposes, baseline for vital signs, phy sical examination results, and 
clinical laboratory  results for subjects will be the data collected at the visit immediately  
prior to starting double -blind treatment.  In an alternate assessment for summarizing the 
safet y and laboratory data, baseline data will be assumed to be the data collected at the 
visit immediately  prior to starting treatment with active upadacitinib.
Incidence of adverse events, changes in vital signs, physical examination results, and 
clinical laboratory values will be anal yzed.
Treatment emergent adverse events will be tabulated by s ystem organ class (SOC) and by  
the Medical Dictionary  for Regulatory  Activities (MedDRA) preferre d term.  Mean 
change from baseline for laboratory  and vital signs data will be summarized by  visit.
Missing safet y data will not be imputed.
The impact of time between completion of RCT and roll -over to OLE will be explored.
8.1.6.2 Analysis of Adverse Events
8.1.6.2.1 Trea tment -Emergent A dverse Events
Adverse events (AEs) will be coded using the Medical Dictionary  for Regulatory  
Activities (MedDRA) dictionary .  Treatment -emergent adverse events, defined as AEs 
that began or worsened in severit y after initiation of open- label study  drug upadacitinib in  
Upadacitinib
M13 -538 Protocol Amendment 6
EudraCT 2013 -003530 -33
98
this OL E study , will be tabulated b y system organ class (SOC) and MedDRA preferred 
term.
Adverse events starting more than 30 day s following discontinuation of study  drug will 
not be included in summaries of treatment -emergent AEs.  Adverse events starting more 
than 30 day s following discontinuation of study  drug will be summarized separatel y as 
post-treatment AEs.
When summarizing adverse events b y relationship or severit y, if a subject has an event 
with unknown severit y or relationship then the subject will be counted in the 
severit y/relationship categories of "unknown" even if the subject has a second occurrence 
of the same event with a severit y/relationship present.  The only  exception is if the subject 
has a second occurrence of the same event with the most extreme severit y (i.e., "severe") 
or a relationship category of "reasonable possibility."  In this case, the subject will be 
counted under these most extreme severit y/relationship categories.
The AEs of special interest (i ncluding but not limited to serious infection, opportunistic 
infection, herpes zoster, TB, gastrointestinal perforations, malignancies, MACE, renal 
dysfunction, anemia, increased CPK, drug -related hepatic disorders and thrombotic and 
embolic events) will be summarized.
Subjects reporting more than 1 AE for a given MedDRA preferred term will be counted 
only once for that term using the most severe incident in each stud y period.  Subjects 
reporting more than 1 t ype of event within an SOC will be counted only  once for that 
SOC.
Frequencies and percentages of subjects with treatment- emergent AEs will be 
summarized as follows:
●Any event
●By system organ class, and preferred term
●By system organ class, preferred term and maximum relationship 
Upadacitinib
M13 -538 Protocol Amendment 6

●Any event and b y system organ class and preferred term for adverse events 
with a relationship of "reasonable possibility "
●Any event and b y system organ class and preferred term for adverse events of 
special inte rest
All AEs leading to premature discontinuation of study drug will be presented in listing 
format.
A listing of treatment -emergent AEs grouped b y SOC and MedDRA preferred term with 
subject ID numbers will be generated.
The post -treatment AEs will be summarized in the same way as the treatment -emergent 
AEs described above.
8.1.6.2.2 Serious A dverse Events and Death
All treatment -emergent serious adverse events, adverse events leading to death, and 
adverse events leading to discontinuation will also be presented in listing format.  In 
addition, SAEs will be summarized by  SOC and MedDRA preferred term.
8.1.6.3 Analysis of Laboratory  and Vital Sign Data
Changes from baseline to minimum value, maximum value and final values in continuous 
laboratory  and vital sign parameters will be summarized.  
Vital signs and laboratory data will be described by  statistical characteristics and 
frequency  of abnormal values.  Frequencies and percentages of subjects with laboratory  
shifts from baseline to the final values using normal ranges t o define categories (low,  
Upadacitinib
M13 -538 Protocol Amendment 6
EudraCT 2013 -003530 -33

beyond the normal values will be listed.  L ow or high laboratory  values will also be 
flagged in the data listings.
8.1.7 Pharmacokinetic and Exposure -Response A nalyses
Individual upadacitinib plasma concentrations at each study visit will be tabulated and 
summarized with appropriate statistical methods.  Upadacitinib pharmacokinetics may be 
evaluated using population PK modeling approach.  The relationshi p between 
upadacitinib exposure and clinical efficacy  or safety  response(s) may  be explored.  The 
data from this study  may  be combined with the data from other studies of upadacitinib for 
the exposure -response analy sis.  Data from this study  may  not be ana lyzed separately .  
Results of the population PK and exposure -response anal yses may  be presented in a 
separate report prior to regulatory filing of upadacitinib for treatment of RA.
Additional analy ses will be performed if useful and appropriate.
8.1.8 Statistica l Analysis of Biomarker Data
Summary  statistics for the pharmacod ynamic biomarkers and disease response biomarkers 
at baseline and post -treatment time points, in addition to change from baseline at each 
time will be provided; this will include mean, standa rd deviation, median, quartiles, and 
range for each group.  Appropriate graphical visualizations such as association of each 
biomarker to the relevant efficacy  endpoints, pairwise correlations between biomarkers, 
trellis/3D plots that condition on baseline factors, etc., will be provided.  The association 
of biomarkers to the efficacy  and safet y endpoints will be explored for each biomarker 
one at a time, and also for combinations of biomarkers via some multivariate predictive 
modeling algorithms.  Pairwise correlations and graphical summaries will be provided.  
Optimal multivariate combinations of biomarkers that associate with efficacy endpoints, 
subject response/non -response (with respect to appropriate clinical endpoints), and also 
with safet y endpoints will be explored via a variety of statistical predictive modeling 
algorithms.  Also cut -points for individual biomarkers and optimal combinations of 
biomarkers that differentiate the subject response with respect to efficacy/safet y endpoints  
Upadacitinib

procedures, AbbVie may engage wi th study  site personnel in efforts to ensure the safet y 
of subjects, maintain protocol compliance, and minimize risks to the integrity of the stud y 
while try ing to best manage subject continuity  of care.  This may  include alternative 
methods for assessment s (e.g. ,virtual site visits), alternative locations for data collection 
(e.g., use of a local lab instead of a central lab), and shipping investigational product 
and/or supplies direct to subjects to ensure continuity  of treatment where allowed.  In all 
cases, these alternative measures must be allowed by  local regulations and permitted by  
IRB/IEC.  Investigators should notify  AbbVie if any  urgent safet y measures are taken to 
protect the subjects against any  immediate hazard.
9.3 Subject Information and Consen t
The investigator or his/her representative will explain the nature of the study to the 
subject, and answer all questions regarding this study.  Prior to an y stud y-related 
screening procedures being performed on the subject, the informed consent statement will 
be reviewed and signed and dated b y the subject, the person who administered the 
informed consent, and any other signatories according to local requirements.  A cop y of 
the informed consent form will be given to the subject and the original will be p laced in

10.2 Case Report Forms
Case report fo rms (CRF) must be completed for each subject enrolled in this study .  These 
forms will be used to transmit information collected during the study to AbbVie and 
regulatory  authorities, as applicable.  The CRF data for this study  are being collected with 
an electronic data capture (EDC) s ystem called Rave®provided by  the technology  vendor 
Medidata Solutions I ncorporated, NY, USA.  The EDC sy stem and the study -specific 
electronic case report forms (eCRFs) will comply with Title 21 CFR Part 11.  The 
documentat ion related to the validation of the EDC sy stem is available through the 
vendor, Medidata, while the validation of the study -specific eCRFs will be conducted by  
AbbVie and will be maintained in the Trial Master File at AbbVie.
The investigator will document subject data in his/her own subject files.  These subject 
files will serve as source data for the stud y.  All eCRF data required by this protocol will 
be recorded b y investigative site personnel in the EDC system.  All data entered into the 
eCRF will be supported by  source documentation.
The investigator or an authorized member of the investigator's staff will make an y 
necessary  corrections to the eCRF.  All change information, including the date and person 
performing the corrections, will be available vi
a the audit trail, which is part of the EDC 
system.  For an y correction, a reason for the alteration will be provided.  The eCRFs will 
be reviewed periodicall y for completeness, legibility , and acceptability  by AbbVie 
personnel (or their representatives). AbbVie (or their representatives) will also be allowed 
access to all source documents pertinent to the study  in order to verify  eCRF entries.  The 
principal investigator will review the eCRFs for completeness and accuracy and provide 
his or her electronic signature and date to eCRFs as evidence thereof.
Medidata will provide access to the EDC s ystem for the duration of the trial through a 
password -protected method of internet access.  Such access will be removed from

the investigator to mak e paper printouts from that media.
The adverse events electronic data capture eCRF data segments of:  alternative etiology, 
severit y, frequency and relationship to study  drug, may  also be used as source and will 
require Investigator approval on the eCRF.
Electronic Patient Reported Outcomes (ePRO)
Patient reported data must be completed for each subject enrolled in this study.  Some of 
these data are being collected with an Electronic Patient Reported Outcome (ePRO) tool 
called Trialmax, provided by  the tec hnology  vendor CRF Health of Lansdale, PA, USA.  
The ePRO sy stem is in compliance with Title 21 CFR Part 11.  The documentation related 
to the sy stem validation of the ePRO tool is available through the vendor, CRF Health, 
while the user acceptance testing of the study -specific ePRO design will be conducted and 
maintained at AbbVie.
The subject and ph ysician will enter the data on an electronic device; these data will be 
uploaded to a server.  The data on the server will be considered source, maintained and
managed b y CRF Health.
Internet access to ePRO data will be provided b y CRF Health for the duration of the trial.  
This access will be available to the investigator and delegated personnel.  Such access will 
be removed at the end of the site's participati on in the study .  Data from the ePRO tool 
will be archived on appropriate data media (CD -ROM, etc.) and provided to the 
investigator at that time as a durable record of the site's ePRO data.  I t will be possible for 
the investigator to make paper printouts from that media.
The ePRO data will be collected electronicall y via a tablet device into which the subject 
and phy sician will record required information.  The electronic device will be 
programmed to allow data entry  for onl y the visits specified in the p rotocol and will not 
allow for patients or ph ysician to complete more than one of the same assessments at any 
one visit.  Data entered on the device will be immediatel y stored to the device itself and

The objective of this sub- study  is to assess the impact of upadacitinib treatment (15 mg 
QD and 30 mg QD) with background MTX on immunologi cal responses to Prevnar 13®
in RA patients.
16.1 Overall Sub -Study Design and Plan:  Description
This sub- study  will evaluate humoral immune response following Prevnar 13®
administration in RA subjects enrolled in the main Study  M13 -538 treated with either 
upadacitinib 15 mg QD or 30 mg QD on a stable dose of background MTX.  I mmune 
response will be measured at three timepoints (pre -vaccination, 4 weeks post -
vaccination, 
and 12 weeks post-vaccination).  Enrollment will continue until approximately  
150subjects have been recruited to participate.
Subjects must be on a stable dose of:
●upadacitinib (15 mg QD or 30 mg QD as assigned in the main study ) for a 
minimum of 4 weeks prior to the Vaccination visit and for at least 4 weeks 
afterwards.
●background methotrexate for a minimum of 4 weeks prior to the Vaccination 
visit and forat least 4 weeks afterwards.
The subject's background anti -rheumatic medications (oral or parenteral corticosteroids, if 
applicable) should also remain stable for a minimum of 4 weeks after the Vaccination 
visit.
At the Vaccination visit, subjects who have provided a written informed consent for the 
sub-study  will be assessed for eligibility .  If eligible, blood samples for the measurement

allowed at an y time after the collection of the Sub -Study  Week 4 post -vaccination titer 
sample.
16.2.4 Efficacy  and Safety  Assessments/Variables
The study  will include a Vaccination visit, followed by  a visit 4 weeks post -vaccination 
for the short -term assessment of immunological responses to Prevnar -13®, and a 
visit12weeks post- vaccination visit for the long -term assessment of immunological 
responses to Prevnar -13®.
Vaccination Visit
The Vaccination visit (Sub- study  Week 0) should occur during an y scheduled main study 
visit.  At this visit, subjects will be rev iewed against the sub- study  inclusion and exclusion 
criteria (Refer to Section 16.2.1 and Section 16.2.2).  Activities for the sub- study  should 
occur onl y after all procedures for the main study visit have been completed, with the 
vaccination occurring at the very  end of sub -study  visit.  Subj ects enrolled into this sub -
study  will have a blood draw for the assessment of pre -vaccination antibodies levels 
specific to Prevnar -13®.  Afterwards, subjects will be administered Prevnar -13®as per the 
local label requirements.  The vaccination should oc cur at the end of the Vaccination visit 
after all other procedures, including procedures from main study  visit, are completed.

The central laboratory  chosen for this study  will provide instructions regarding the 
collection, processing and shipping of these samples.
Post-Vaccination Visits
Subjects should return to the site for 4 week and 12 week post -vaccination visits (Sub-
study  Week 4 and Sub -Study  Week 12) to complete the sub -study  procedures identified in 
Table 6.  The 12 week post -vaccination visit should coincide with the subject's regularl y 
scheduled main stud y visit.  At the 4 -week post -vaccination visit, blood will be drawn for 
the assessment of humoral immune responses to Prevnar -13®and assessment of adverse 
events will be performed.  At the 12 -week post -vaccination visit, in addition to the main 
study  procedures, collection of blood samples to measure immune response to Prevnar -
13®will occur.

16.2.5 Statistical A nalysis of Efficacy
Primary Variables
1. Proportion of subjects with satisfactory  humoral response to Prevnar 13®at the 
Week 4 visit of the sub -study  (4 weeks post -vaccination).
Satisfactory  humoral response to Prevnar 13®is defined as greater than or equal to 
(≥)2-fold increase in antibody  concentration from the vaccination baseline in at least 6 
out of the 12 pneumococcal antigens (1, 3, 4, 5, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F and 23F).
Secondary Variables
1. Proportion of subjects with satisfactory  humoral response to Prevnar 13®at the 
Week 12 visit of the sub- study  (12 weeks post -vaccination).
2. Geometric Mean Fold Rise (GMFR) of anti -pneumococcal antibody  levels to each 
of the 12 pneumococcal antigens above vaccination baseline values at Week 4 and 
Week 12 of the sub -study
16.2.6 Statistical Methods and Determination of Sample Size
Statistical and Analytical Plans
All efficacy  analy ses will be carried ou t using the Full Anal ysis Set population of the 
Vaccine Sub
-study , which includes all enrolled subjects who were vaccinated and 
received at least one dose of study  drug after vaccination during the sub -study .  Subjects 
will be classified into upadacitinib 15 mg QD dose group or upadacitinib 30 mg QD dose 
group based on their upadacitinib dose at the vaccination visit.
The proportion of subjects achieving Satisfactory Humoral Response will be summarized 
by count and percentages for each upadacitinib dose group at 4 weeks post -
vaccination

and 12 weeks post- vaccination.  95% confidence intervals for each upadacitinib dose 
group will be provided.
At 4 weeks post -vaccination and 12 weeks post -vaccination, the geometric mean fold rise 
(GMFR) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals of anti -pneumococcal antibodies as 
compared with pre -vaccination will be summarized for each upadacitinib dose group.  
Calculations will be done using logarithmicall y transformed assay results, and then back -
transformed to the original scale. 
All efficacy  analy ses will be based on observed cases.  No multiplicity  adjustment is 
planned for an y anal ysis in this vaccine sub -study .
Determination of Sample Size
A total sample size of approximately  150 subjects is planned for the sub -study , where 
approximately  100 subjects are expected to be on upadacitinib 15 mg QD dose.  
Assuming a satisfactory  humoral response rate of 60%, the planned sample size of 
approximately  100 subjects for upadacitinib 15 mg QD group will provide a margin of 
error o f approximately  10% for this dose group when using a 95% confidence interval.

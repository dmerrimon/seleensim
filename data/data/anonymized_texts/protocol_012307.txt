Study Design and 
Methodology  This is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, parallel-grou p, 
three -arm, placebo-controlled, therapeutic equivalence study with 
clinical end -points. The study will compare the efficacy and safety of 
Test Product “Oxymetazoline hydrochloride Cream, 1%” 
(manufactured by Actavis Laboratories, Salt Lake City, UT ) with that 
of an approved topical formulation RHOFADETM (Oxymetazoline 
hydrochloride  Cream, 1%) marketed by Allergan, in healthy males 
and non -pregnant females diagnosed with moderate to severe 
persistent facial erythema of rosacea.  Both the test and the reference 
formulations will also be compared to a placebo (vehicle) formu lation 
to test for supe riority. 
Subjects with a conﬁrmed diagnosis of moderate to severe persistent 
facial erythema of rosacea  will be randomized to either Test Group 
(Oxymetazoline hydrochloride Cream, 1%); Reference Group 
(RHOFADETM, Oxymetazoline hydrochloride Cream, 1%) ; or 
Placebo Group  (Vehicle Cream). 
The study subject will receive treatment for approximately 29  days 
from the Baseline visit to the EoT visit. There will be 4 study visits, 3 
to the study site  and 1 telephone follow-up: Screening  
visit, Baseline (Day 1 ) visit, Telephone Follow-up (Day 14 ) visit, 
and EoT (Day 29 ) visit. 
At screening a written Informed Consent Form (ICF) has to be signed 
by the subject and the eligibility criteria of the subject will  b e  
evaluated by clinical assessmen ts.   
 
 
 Subjects shou ld sign 
ICF prior to start of any study procedures, complete washout, a nd

 return to the clinic to conduct the remainder of the screening 
procedures.  
Study subject numbers will be assigned to study subjects  sequentially 
in the order in which study subjects are enrolle d into the study.  
After the screening visit, each qualified subject will return t o the clinic 
on Day  1 for confirmation of eligibility. Eligible subjects will be 
assigned  to one of the three study treatment groups as per the 
computer -generated randomization schedule, and the assigned study 
medication will be dispensed by the study site staff. Since thi s is a 
double -blind study, neither the study team at the site nor the subject s 
will know the treatment t he subject is assigned . 
The subject will be instructe d to apply a pea- size amount of the study 
treatment to cover the entire face (forehead, chin, nose, and each 
cheek  [avoiding the eyes and lips]), once daily preferably, at the same 
time each da y, up to and including the day before scheduled Visit 4 
(Day  29±2).  
 
 On Day 1 visit and Day 29±2 visit, the subject will apply the 
assigned medication at the clinic under the supervision  of an 
Independent Dispenser ( unblinded to the treatment the subject is 
receiving ).  
 
 From Day 2 up to and including the day before scheduled 
Visit 4 (Day 29 ), the subject will be asked to apply the assigned 
medication once daily preferably, at the same time each day,  and 
complete the subject diary, h anded over by the study site staff at 
Baseline visit.  
 
The subject will note the date and time of 
application of the study  medication, any AE experienced, and any 
concomitant medication taken or changes from the existing ones,  i n  
the subject diary  from Visit 2 (Day 1) to Visit 4 (Day 29 ). A phone 
call will be made around Day 14 to follow up for any change in 
concomitant medications, and check on complianc e of study 
medication usage .

 x Equivalence testing 
Therapeutic equivalence will be concluded if the 90% confidence  
interval for the difference between test and reference products (πT –  
πR) of the treatment success rates at all timepoints 3, 6, 9, and 12 
hours post-application on Day 29 falls within the acc eptance range of 
[-0.20, +0.20] using PP population.  
x Superiority testing  
A two -sided exact Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel t est, stratified by clinical 
site, will be applied to test the difference between treatment success

equivalence analysis (superiority of Test Product and Reference  
Product over Placebo) will be established if active treatment s uccess 
rate is higher than and statistically significantly different from (p-
value < 0.05) that of the Placebo group for each active treatme nt using 
the mITT population.  No adjustment will be made for multiplicity.

 1 INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND 
1.1 Rationale for the Study 
This therapeutic equivalence study with clinical endpoint is de signed to determine the 
therapeutic equivalence of “Oxymetazoline hydrochloride Cream, 1% ” (manufactured by 
Actavis Laboratories, Salt Lake City, UT) with the reference li sted drug (RLD) 
RHOFADETM (Oxymetazoline hydrochloride Cream, 1%) marketed by Allergan, in healthy 
males and non-pregnant females diagnosed with moderate to sever e persistent facial 
erythema of rosacea. 
1.2 Overview of Study Indication 
Rosacea is a common, chronic dermatological condition of uncert ain etiology that is 
characterized by a myriad of clinical manifestations, including  persistent erythema (which 
may be accompanied by facial stinging and burning), facial edema, superficial 
telangiectasias, recurrent papules and pustules, facial phymas (most commonly rhinophyma), 
and ocular manifestations.[1,2] In a recent meta-analysis, the global prevalence of rosacea wa s 
found to affect 5.46% of the adult population.[3] It is estimated to affect more than 16 million 
Americans, yet only a small fraction is being treated.[4] Its onset is typically between the ages 
of 30 and 50, and women are affected 2 to 3 times more often th an men.[5] Of all the clinical 
manifestations of rosacea, facial flushing and persistent eryth e m a  a r e  a m o n g  t h e  m o s t  
common and are often associated with psychological distress.[6,7,8] Although the precise 
etiology and pathogenesis of erythematous rosacea remain uncert ain, it is hypothesized that 
abnormal flushing and persistent erythema result from a progres sive dysregulation in the 
cutaneous vasomotor response (i.e ., persistently dilated facial  blood vessels).[9] 
While rosacea is not curable, it is a treatable condition; trea tment goals include alleviation of 
signs and symptoms, improvement of appearance, and delay or pre vention of advancement of 
the condition. Effective treatments have been developed to trea t papulopustular rosacea using 
topical anti-infective agents such as sulfonamides, metronidazo le, azelaic acid, ivermectin 
and tetracyclines.[2,10] 
Conspicuous facial redness may have a deep impact on a patient' s self-esteem and quality of 
life. Surveys of rosacea patients conducted by the National Ros acea Society indicate that 
more than 90% had lowered self-esteem and self-confidence; of r osacea patients with severe 
symptoms, 88% said the condition had adversely affected their p rofessional interactions. 
Nearly 51% said they had even m issed work because of their cond ition.[4] 
Most topical pharmacologic agents approved by the United States  Food and Drug 
Administration (US FDA) for treatment of papules and pustules o f rosacea have no effect on 
persistent facial erythema. Oxymetazoline, an alpha 1A-adrenoceptor agonist, is approved by 
the US FDA to treat persistent facial erythema of rosacea. A lo ng-term safety and dermal 
tolerability of once daily application of oxymetazoline over 52 weeks has been established. No clinically relevant rebound effect was observed; efficacy wa s observed at day 1 through 
52 weeks and response rates increased throughout the study.
[11] 
1.3 Reference Product Information (RHOFADETM)[12] 
Oxymetazoline is an alpha 1A-adrenoceptor agonist and vasoconstrictor of the cutaneous 
microvasculature that is US FDA approved for the topical treatm ent of persistent facial 
erythema associated with rosacea in adults. [12] 
 
1.3.1 Dosage and administration 

TEVA Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc . 
Protocol No.: OXY2018-01 Version No.: 3.0;  29 JAN 2020 
 
Confidential  Page 25 of 102  
 Oxymetazoline cream is for topical use only. A pea-sized amount  of oxymetazoline cream, 
once daily should be applied in a thin layer to cover the entir e face (forehead, nose, each 
cheek, and chin) while avoiding the eyes and lips. Hands should  be washed immediately after 
applying the cream. [12] 
1.3.2 Pharmacokinetics 
Absorption  
The pharmacokinetics of oxymetazoline cream was evaluated follo wing topical 
administration in a thin layer to cover the entire face in adul t subjects with erythema 
associated with rosacea. The median weight of cream for each do se administration was 0.3 g. 
Plasma oxymetazoline concentrations were measurable in most of the subjects. Following the 
first dose application, the mean ± standard deviation (SD) peak  concentrations (C max) and 
area under the concentration-time curves from time 0 to 24 hour s (AUC 0-24h) were 60.5 ± 
53.9 pg/mL and 895 ±798 pg*hr/mL, respectively. Following once daily applications for 28 
days, the mean ± SD C max and AUC 0-24h were 66.4 ± 67.1 pg/mL and 1050 ± 992 pg*hr/mL, 
respectively. [12] 
 Distribution  
An in vitro  study demonstrated that oxymetazoline is 56.7% to 57.5% bound to human 
plasma proteins. [12]  
 Metabolism  
In vitro  studies using human liver microsomes showed that oxymetazoline  w a s  m i n i m a l l y  
metabolized, generating mono-oxygenated and dehydrogenated prod ucts of oxymetazoline. 
The percentage of parent drug oxymetazoline remaining was 95.9% after a 120-minute 
incubation with human liver microsomes. [12]  
 Excretion  
The excretion of oxymetazoline following administration of oxymetazoline hydrochloride 
cream has not been characterized in humans. [12]  
Pharmacokinetic Interactions 
In vitro studies using human liver microsomes demonstrated that  oxymetazoline up to the 
tested concentration of 100 nM had no inhibition on the activities of the cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoenzymes 1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, and 3A4/5. Trea tment of cultured 
human hepatocytes with up to 100 nM oxymetazoline did not induc e CYP1A2, CYP2B6, or 
CYP3A4.
 [12]  
1.3.3 Drug interactions 
Anti-hypertensives/Cardiac Glycosides   
Alpha-adrenergic agonists, as a class, may impact blood pressur e. Caution should be taken in 
using drugs such as beta-blockers, anti-hypertensives and/or ca rdiac glycosides. 
Caution should also be exercised in subjects receiving alpha 1 adrenergic receptor antagonists 
such as in the treatment of ca rdiovascular disease, benign pros tatic hypertrophy, or Raynaud's 
disease. [12]  
Monoamine Oxidase (MAO) Inhibitors 
Caution should be taken with subjects taking MAO inhibitors tha t can affect the metabolism 
and uptake of circulating amines. [12]

 1.3.4 Adverse effects 
Clinical Studies Experience  
A total of 489 subjects with persistent facial erythema associa ted with rosacea were treated 
with oxymetazoline cream once daily for 4 weeks in 3 controlled  clinical trials. An additional 
440 subjects with persistent facial erythema associated with ro sacea were also treated with 
oxymetazoline cream once daily for up to one year in a long-ter m (open-label) clinical trial. 
Adverse reactions that occurred in at least 1% of subjects trea ted with oxymetazoline cream 
through 4 weeks of treatment are presented below. [12]

In the long-term (open-label) clinical trial, the rates of adve rse reactions over a one-year 
treatment period were as follows: worsening inflammatory lesion s of rosacea (3%), 
application site dermatitis (3% ), application site pruritis (2% ), application site pain (2%), and 
application site erythema (2%). Subjects with persistent erythe ma along with inflammatory 
lesions were allowed to use additional therapy for the inflamma tory lesions of rosacea. [12] 
 
1.3.5 Contraindications 
None [12] 
1.3.6 Warnings and precautions 
Potential Impacts on Cardiovascular Disease  
Alpha-adrenergic agonists may impact blood pressure. Oxymetazol ine cream should be used 
with caution in subjects with severe or unstable or uncontrolle d cardiovascular disease, 
orthostatic hypotension, and uncontrolled hypertension or hypot ension. Subjects with 
cardiovascular disease, orthostatic hypotension, and/or uncontr olled 
hypertension/hypotension should be advised to seek immediate me dical care if their condition 
worsens. [12]  
 Potentiation of Vascular Insufficiency  

TEVA Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc . 
Protocol No.: OXY2018-01 Version No.: 3.0;  29 JAN 2020 
 
Confidential  Page 27 of 102  
 Oxymetazoline cream should be used with caution in subjects with cerebral or coronary 
insufficiency, Raynaud’s phenomenon, thromboangiitis obliterans , scleroderma, or Sjögren’s 
syndrome. Subjects should be advised to seek immediate medical care if signs and symptoms 
of potentiation of vascular insufficiency develop. [12]  
 Risk of Angle Closure Glaucoma  
Oxymetazoline cream may increase the risk of angle closure glau coma in subjects with 
narrow-angle glaucoma. Subjects should be advised to seek immed iate medical care if signs 
and symptoms of acute angle closure glaucoma develop. [12] 
1.3.7 Use in specific populations 
Pregnancy  
Risk Summary  
There are no available data on oxymetazoline cream use in pregn ant women to inform a drug 
associated risk for major birth defects and miscarriage. A lite rature article describing 
intranasal decongestant use in pregnant women identified a potential association between 
second-trimester exposure to oxymetazoline (with no decongestan t exposure in the first 
trimester) and renal collecting system anomalies. In animal reproduction studies, there were no adverse developmental effects observed after oral administra tion of oxymetazoline 
hydrochloride in pregnant rats and rabbits at systemic exposure s up to 3 times and 73 times, 
respectively, the exposure associated with the maximum recommen ded human dose. The 
estimated background risks of major birth defects and miscarria ge for the indicated 
population are unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or 
other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pr egnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, 
respectively.
 [12] 
Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions  
Following repeated use of oxymetazoline hydrochloride solution nasal spray for the treatment 
of nasal congestion at a dose 5 times higher than recommended, one case of fetal distress was 
reported in a 41-week pregnant patient. The fetal distress reso lved hours later, prior to the 
delivery of the healthy infant. The anticipated exposures for the case are 8- to18-fold higher than plasma exposures after topical administration of oxymetazo line cream.
 [12] 
Human Data   
No adequate and well-controlled trials of oxymetazoline cream h ave been conducted in 
pregnant women. Across all clinical trials of oxymetazoline cre am, two pregnancies were 
reported. One pregnancy resulte d in the delivery of a healthy c hild. One pregnancy resulted in 
a spontaneous abortion, which was considered to be unrelated to the trial medication. A literature article summarizing the results of exploratory analy ses of intranasal decongestant 
use during pregnancy identified a potential association between  second-trimester exposure to 
oxymetazoline hydrochloride solution (with no decongestant expo sure in the first trimester) 
and renal collecting system anomalies.
 [12] 
Lactation  
No clinical data are available to assess the effects of oxymeta zoline on the quantity or rate of 
breastmilk production, or to establish the level of oxymetazoline present in human breastmilk post-dose. Oxymetazoline was detected in the milk of lactating rats. The developmental and 
health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother’s clinical need

 for oxymetazoline cream and any potential adverse effects on th e breastfed child from 
oxymetazoline cream or from the underlying maternal condition. [12] 
Pediatric Use  
Safety and effectiveness of oxymetazoline cream have not been e stablished in pediatric 
subjects below the age of 18 years. [12] 
Geriatric Use  
One hundred and ninety-three subjects aged 65 years and older r eceived treatment with 
oxymetazoline cream (n = 135) or vehicle (n = 58) in clinical t rials. No overall differences in 
safety or effectiveness were observed between subjects > 65 yea rs of age and younger 
subjects, based on available data. Clinical studies of oxymetaz oline cream did not include 
sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine wh ether they respond 
differently from younger subjects. [12]

 2 OBJECTIVES 
2.1 Primary Objective 
The primary objective of this clinical study is to establish th e therapeutic equivalence  
between Test Product (Oxymetazoline hydrochloride Cream, 1%, ma nufactured by Actavis 
Laboratories, Salt Lake City, UT) and Reference Product (RHOFAD ETM Cream, 1%, 
Allergan) using the primary endpoint (proportion of subjects wi th treatment success at all 
time-points 3, 6, 9, and 12 hours post application on Day 29) ,  in subjects with moderate to 
severe persistent facial erythema of rosacea. 
(1) To evaluate study sensitivity, the Test and Reference products will be statistically 
evaluated with regard to their superiority (P < 0.05) over placebo for the primary 
endpoints 
2.2 Safety Objectives 
 
(1) To monitor adverse events (AEs) and assess the safety and toler ability of Test Product 
and Reference Product in subjects with moderate to severe persi stent facial erythema of 
rosacea. 
3 STUDY DESIGN 
3.1 Design Overview  
This is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, parallel-grou p, three-arm, placebo-
controlled, therapeutic equivalence study with clinical end-poi nt. The study will compare the 
efficacy and safety of Test Product “Oxymetazoline hydrochloride Cream, 1% ” 
(manufactured by Actavis Laboratories, Salt Lake City, UT) with that of an approved topical 
formulation RHOFADETM (Oxymetazoline hydrochloride Cream, 1%) marketed by Allergan, 
in healthy males and non-pregnant females diagnosed with modera te to severe persistent 
facial erythema of rosacea. Both the test and the reference for mulations will also be 
compared to a placebo (vehicle) formulation to test for superio rity. 
Subjects with a conﬁrmed diagnosis of moderate to severe persistent facial erythema of 
rosacea will be randomized to one of  the three treatment groups  as follows: 
Test Group:  Oxymetazoline hydrochloride Cre am, 1%, to be applied once dail y preferably, 
and at the same time each day, for 29 days. 
Reference Group:  RHOFADETM (Oxymetazoline hydrochloride Cream, 1%), to be applied 
once daily preferably, and at the same time each day, for 29 da ys.

2), Telephone Follow-up (Day 14 ) visit (Visit 3), and EoT (Da y 29 ) visit (Visit 4).  
At screening, a written Informed Consent Form (ICF) has to be s igned by the subject and the 
eligibility criteria of the subject will be evaluated by clinic al assessments.  If necessary, 
subjects will be allowed to conduct screening procedures on two separate days in order to 
allow for enough time to complete the adequate washout period r equired for medications, 
makeup use, etc. Subjects should sign ICF (prior to the start o f any study procedures), 
complete washout, and return to the clinic to conduct the remai nder of the screening 
procedures. 
After the screening visit, each qualified subject will return t o the clinic on Day 1 for 
confirmation of eligibility. Eligible subjects will be assigned  to one of the three study 
treatment groups as per the computer-generated randomization sc hedule, and the assigned 
study medication will be dispensed by the study site staff.  Si nce this is a double-blind study, 
neither the study team at the site nor the subjects will know the treatment the subject is 
assigned. 
Treatment will be initiated at the clinic on Day 1 after collec ting baseline measurements for 
both CEA and SSA for facial erythe ma as per the scales defined (Table 3-1). 
The subject will be instructed to apply a pea-size amount of th e study treatment to cover the 
entire face (forehead, chin, nose, and each cheek [avoiding the  eyes and lips]), once daily 
preferably, at the same time each day, for 29 days. On Day 1 vi sit and Day 29 visit, the 
subject will apply the assigned medication at the clinic under the supervision of an 
Independent Dispenser, unblinded to the treatment the subject i s receiving.  
 
From Day 2 to Day 28, the subject will be asked to apply the assigned 
medication once daily preferably, at the same time each day, an d complete the subject diary, 
handed over by the study site staff at Baseline visit. The subj ect will note the date and time of 
application of the study medication, any AE experienced, and an y concomitant medication 
taken or changes from the existing ones, in the subject diary f rom Day 1 to Day 29. 
A phone call will be made by the site to the subject around Day  14 to follow up for any  
change in concomitant medications, adherence to study restrictions, overall well-being of the 
subject, and check on compliance of study medication usage.  
Key assessments 
The schedule of visits and the assessments to be performed at e ach visit are presented in 
Table 6-1. Assessments should be performed by the same evaluato r throughout the study 
whenever possible. 
Efficacy Measurements  
Efficacy measurements include Investigator’s  assessment of the severity of facial erythema 
using the CEA scale and subject’s assessment of the severity of facial erythema using the 
SSA scale, at Pre-dose, 3, 6, 9, and 12 hours on Day 1 and Day 29. The CEA and SSA scales 
are shown in Table 3-1.

Safety/Tolerability Safety of the subject will be m onitored and evaluated continuously throughout the study, after 
application of the first dose of assigned study treatment. Safe ty will be assessed by close 
monitoring and timely assessment of: Vital signs: Blood pressure, heart rate and body temperature wi ll be recorded at screening; at 
pre-dose and 12 hours on Day 1; and at pre-dose and 12 hours on  Day 29. 
Adverse event monitoring: Subjects will be questioned about any  adverse events along with 
investigator evaluation of any application site reactions (including application site dermatitis, 
application site pruritis, application site erythema, and appli cation site pain, scaling or 
burning) at, Day 1 and Day 29. 
Pregnancy tests: A urine pregnancy test at screening visit and on Day 1 and Day 29 visits will 
be done for women of childbearing potential.  Physical examination:
 The Investigator will examine the subject for any physical 
abnormalities at screening and Day 29 for the following body sy stems: general appearance, 
head, eyes, ears, nose, throat, heart/cardiovascular, lungs, ab domen, neurologic, extremities, 
back, musculoskeletal, lymphatic, skin, and other findings. The  subject’s height and weight 
will be recorded at screening only. 
3.2 Primary Endpoints 
The primary efficacy endpoint will be used to address the prima ry objective, which aims at 
demonstrating therapeutic equivalence between Test Product and Reference products. 
The primary efficacy endpoint is the proportion of subjects wit h treatment success at all time-

postmenopausal. Female subjects of childbearing potential (WOCBP) are defined as 
sexually mature women without prior hys terectomy, or who have had any evidence of 
menses in the past 12 months. However, women who have been amenorrheic for the past 
12 or more months are still considered to be of childbearing potential, if the amenorrhea is possibly due to other causes, including prior chemotherapy, anti- estrogens, or ovarian suppression. Postmenopausal women (defined as women who have been amenorrheic for at least 12 consecutive months, in the appropriate age group, without other known or 
suspected primary cause) or women who have been sterilized surgically or who are 
otherwise proven sterile (i.e., total hysterectomy, or bilateral oophorectomy with surgery 
at least 4 weeks prior to randomization) are not considered WOCBP. Subjects who have undergone tubal ligation are NOT considered as surgically sterile. 
5. Female subjects of childbearing potential must be willing to us e an acceptable form of 
birth control from the day of the first dose administration to 30 days after the last 
administration of IP. For the purpose of this study the followi ng are considered acceptable

Depo-Provera
® (medroxyprogesterone acetate-stabilized for at least 3 months) ; vaginal 
contraceptive; contraceptive implant; double barrier methods (e.g. condom and 
spermicide); Nuvaring vaginal hormonal birth control, intra-ute rine device (IUD), or 
abstinence with a second method of birth control should the sub ject become sexually 
active.  
6. Moderate to severe persistent facial erythema associated with r osacea, defined as a grade 
of ≥3 on the CEA scale as assessed by the Investigator at Screening and on Baseline 
(Day 1) visit prior to study drug application (Table 3-1).

 5.2 Treatment Assignment (Randomization) 
The kit number will correspond to a computer-generated randomiz ation schedule assigning 
that number to one of the three study treatment groups.
 
The study subject numbers will be assigned to study subjects se quentially in the order in 
which study subjects are enrolled into the study. 
 
5.3 Dosage and Administration 
The study medication will be dispensed to the subjects on Day 1  at the study site. Subjects 
will gently wash their face with a mild, non-medicated cleanser  ), rinse 
with warm water and pat dry. The subjects will be asked to appl y a pea-size amount of the 
assigned study treatment cream to cover the entire face [forehe ad, chin, nose, and each cheek 
(avoiding the eyes and lips)], once daily, preferably at the sa me time each day, for 29 days. 
Subjects will be instructed to a void applying the study medicat ion to the eyes, eyelids, lips, 
mouth, scalp, neck, ears, and any membrane of the inner nose, o r open wounds. Subjects will 
be required to wash their hands be fore and after each applicati on of study treatment.

 5.6 Blinding 
This is a double-blinded clinical end point bioequivalence stud y. Study medications will be 
provided in similar cartons to maintain study blinding.  
If necessary, for the safety and proper treatment of the subjec ts, the Investigator can unblind 
the subject’s treatment assignment to conduct appropriate follow-up care. Whe never possible, 
the Sponsor or medical monitor will be notified before unblinding the study medication. The 
date and signature of the person breaking the code as well as t he reason for breaking the code 
and any associated AEs w ill be recorded in the subject’s source documentation. 
The Investigator, staff at the s tudy site, study monitors, and data analysis/management 
personnel will be blinded to the treatment assigned to the subj ect. The study site will have at 
least one Independent Dispenser. The role of the unblinded Independent Dispenser will be to dispense and collect study med ication to/from the subjects, mai ntain dispensing records, and 
ensure the study medication logs are complete and accurate. The  Independent Dispenser will 
also be responsible for observing and supervising the administration of the study medication by the subject on clinic visits, Day 1 and Day 29.  The subject  will be requested not to discuss 
the appearance of the study medication with the Investigator or  study staff outside of the 
Independent Dispenser. Independent dispenser should not partici pate in any activities other 
than the activities defined in this section. To ensure that inf ormation that could potentially 
bias handling of data is not disclosed, the packaging team will  hold the randomization 
scheme until after database lock.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
At the conclusion of the study, after the database has been loc ked, each site will be sent the 
study randomization scheme (respective to their site) that shou ld be retained with the study 
documents in the event of an FDA inspection along with evidence  of when the randomization 
scheme was provided.

 5.7 Assessment of Compliance 
A subject diary will be provided to all subjects on Day 1 where it is required to document the 
date and time of application of the study medication. In the su bject diary, subjects will also 
note any AE observed and any concomitant medication taken or ch anges. 
Compliance will be determined from the subject diary, which the  subject will be trained and 
instructed to use to record the application of study medication each day, as well as all missed 
applications. The number of misse d and additional applications will be captured on the 
compliance page of the CRF. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
5.8 Study Medication Replacement 
In the event of loss/spillage, extra tubes of study medication may need to be dispensed.  See 
IMP manual for details. 
Before dispensing the replacement study medication, the informa tion will be recorded on the 
Study Medication Accountability Log. 
5.9 Accountability of Study Medication 
It is the responsibility of the Investigator to ensure that the  accountability of the IP is 
maintained at the study site where study medication is stored and dispensed.  
A Drug Accountability Log will assist study site staff in maint aining inventory records of 
study medication.  
The study medications will be dispensed only by an appropriately Independent dispenser. 
Study subjects must return used/unused IP to the Independent Di spenser. Any remaining drug 
supplies can be accounted for and noted in the Drug Accountabil ity Log. The original Drug 
Accountability Log must remain at the study site and a copy should be provided to the study monitor after the study. See IMP manual for details. 
5.10 Retention of Study Medication Samples 
Retention samples should be randomly selected from the drug sup plies received prior to 
dispensing to subjects.

Unscheduled Visit and Early Discontinuation Visit 
Unscheduled visit may occur as necessary, for any reason, if in  the Investigator’s  opinion it is 
warranted. If the Unscheduled Visit is due to an AE, the Invest igator will determine whether 
additional visits are needed. Relevant and clinically significant laboratory data and AEs 
obtained at the unscheduled visits should be entered into the e CRF and recorded in the source 
documentation as necessary.  
If a study subject is discontinued from the study during an Uns cheduled Visit, the 
Unscheduled Visit will be referred to as an Early Discontinuati on Visit and all procedures 
scheduled for Day 29 Visit will be performed. If the Unschedule d Visit is not an Early 
Discontinuation Visit (i.e., the study subject will continue to  take part in the study), then the 
reason for unscheduled visit is documented and required procedu res at the discretion of 
Investigator considering the reason for visit, will be performe d.

 6.5.2 Adverse events 
Incidence of all AEs reported during the study will be summariz ed using the current version 
of Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) dictio nary by treatment group, 
body system, severity, and relationship to the study drug. No i nferential statistical analyses 
are planned. 
6.5.2.1 Definitions 
Adverse event (AE) 
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject, regardle ss of whether it has a causal 
relationship with this treatment. 
In this study, any AE occurring after the subject has signed th e ICF until the end of follow-up 
period should be recorded and reported as an AE. An AE can, therefore, be any unfavorable and unintended physica l sign, symptom, or 
laboratory parameter that develops or worsens in severity durin g the course of this study, or 
significant worsening of the disease under study or of any conc urrent disease, whether or not 
considered related to the study drug. A new condition or the wo rsening of a pre-existing 
condition will be considered an AE. Stable chronic conditions ( such as arthritis) that are 
present before study entry and do not worsen during this study will not be considered AEs. 
Accordingly, an AE can include any of the following: 
x intercurrent illnesses 
x physical injuries 
x events possibly related to concomitant medication 
x significant worsening (change in nature, severity, or frequency ) of the disease under study 
or other preexisting conditions drug interactions 
x events occurring during diagnostic procedures or during any was hout phase of this study 
 
Worsening of the disease under study will be measured by evalua tion of pain, inflammation 
lesions of rosacea, dermatitis, pruritus and erythema at the application site. The evaluation of 
pain and inflammation should be recorded as an AE only if the p resentation and/or outcome 
is more severe than would normally be expected from the normal course of the disease in a 
particular subject. 
A treatment-emergent AE (TEAE) i s any AE that occurs after init iation of study medication, 
or any event already present that worsens in either intensity o r frequency following exposure 
to study medication. Serious adverse event (SAE) 
A SAE is an AE occurring at any dose that results in any of the following outcomes or 
actions: 
x death 
x a life-threatening AE (i.e., the subject was at immediate risk of death from the event as it 
occurred; does not include an event that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might 
have caused death)

 x in-subject hospitalization or prol ongation of existing hospital ization means that hospital 
in-subject admission and/or prolon gation of hospital stay were required for treatment of 
an AE, or that they occurred as a consequence of the event. Hos pitalizations scheduled 
prior to study entry will not be considered SAEs, unless there was worsening of the 
preexisting condition during the subject’s  participation in this study. 
x persistent or significant disability or incapacity (refers to a  substantial disruption of one’s  
ability to conduct normal life functions) 
x a congenital anomaly/birth defect 
x an important medical event that may not result in death, be lif e-threatening, or require 
hospitalization, but may jeopardize the subject and may require  medical intervention to 
prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples  o f  s u c h  e v e n t s  a r e  
intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergi c bronchospasm; blood 
dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization ; or the development of drug 
dependency or drug abuse. Note: A ny suspected transmission of a n infectious agent via a 
medicinal product is considered an important medical event. 
x An AE that does not meet any of the criteria for seriousness li sted above will be regarded 
as a non-SAE. 
Other significant adverse events  
When tested, marked hematological and other laboratory abnormal ities (other than those 
meeting the definition of serious) and any events that led to a n intervention, including 
withdrawal of test drug/IP treatment, dose reduction, or significant additional concomitant 
therapy, other than those reported as SAEs, should be collected in the CRF and summarized in the Clinical Study Report (CSR). 
6.5.2.2 Classifications for adverse event assessment 
All AEs will be assessed and docu mented by the Investigator acc ording to the categories 
detailed below. 
Seriousness 
For each AE, the seriousness must be determined according to th e criteria given in Section 
6.5.2.1. Intensity 
The severity of each adverse event must be recorded as 1 of the  choices on the following 
scales. Mild: No limitation of usual activities 
Moderate: Some limitation of usual activities 
Severe: Inability to carry out usual activities Causal relationship 
The assessment of the causal relationship between an AE and the  administration of treatment 
is a decision to be made by the investigator, who is a qualified physician, based on all 
information available at the time of the completion of the eCRF.

 Causality should be assessed separately for each study treatmen t as detailed in the eCRF. If 
the investigator feels that the event cannot be firmly attribut ed to one of the study treatments  
(e.g., owing to a suspected underlying interaction), the same a ssessment will be documented 
for each study treatment. 
Adverse events will be assessed for the relationship to the stu dy drug (causality) according to 
the following scale: 
 
TERM  DEFINITION  CLARIFICATION  
No 
Reasonable 
Possibility 
(not relate d) This category applies to those 
adverse events which, after careful 
considerati on, are clearly due to 
extra neous causes (disease, 
environment,  etc.) or to those 
adverse  events, which after careful 
medical  consideration at the time 
they are evaluated, are judged to 
be unrelated to the test drug. An adverse experience  may be considered “No 
Reasonable  Possibility ” if it is clearly due to 
extraneous  causes or when (must have two): 
• It does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence 
from the administration of the test drug. 
• It could readily have been produced by  t h e  
subject’s  clinical state, environmental or toxic 
factors, or other modes of therapy administered to 
the subject. 
• It does not follow a known pattern of response to 
the test drug. 
• It does not reappear or worsen when the drug is re-
administered.  
Reasonable 
Possibility (related)
 This category applies to those 
adverse  events for which, after 
careful  medical consideration at 
the t i m e  t h e y  a r e  evaluated, a 
connection  with the test drug 
administration  cannot be ruled out 
with certainty or felt with a  h i g h  
degree  of certainty to be related to 
the test drug. An adverse experience may be considered “Reasonable 
Possibility  related ” if or when (at least two of the 
following):  
• It follows a reasonable temporal sequence from 
administration of the drug. 
• It could not be reasonably explained by the known 
characteristics of the subject’s  clinical state, 
environmental or toxic factors, or other modes of 
therapy administered to the subject. 
• It disappears or decreases on cessation or reduction 
in dose. There are important exceptions when an 
adverse event does not disappear upon 
discontinuation of the drug, yet drug relatedness 
clearly exists. 
• It follows a known pattern of response to the  test  
drug. 
 
 Expectedness 
An AE which is not included in the adverse events section of th e relevant Safety Information 
Reference by its specificity, severity, outcome or frequency is considered an unexpected 
adverse event. 
The reference safety information for this study is to be found in Appendix II.

 When applicable, t he sponsor’s  Pharmacovigilance Department will determine the 
expectedness for all serious adverse events. CRO and investigat ors will not determine the 
expectedness. 
 
Action taken with study treatment 
Any action on study treatment to resolve the AE is to be documented using the categories 
listed below. 
The study treatment action should be recorded separately for ea ch study treatment as detailed 
in the eCRF. 
x Drug withdrawn 
x Drug interrupted 
x Dose reduced 
x Dose not changed

 For AE recording, the study period is defined for each subject as that time period from 
signature of the ICF through the end of the study.  
All AEs that occur during the defined study period must be reco rded on the source 
documentation, regardless of the s everity of the event or judge d relationship to the study 
drug. For SAEs, the SAE Form must also be completed, and the SA E must be reported 
immediately (see Section 12). Th e Investigator does not need to  actively monitor subjects for 
AEs once the study has ended. Ho wever, SAEs occurring in a subj ect after the treatment of 
that subject has ended should be reported to the Sponsor if the  Investigator becomes aware of 
them. At each contact with the subject, the Investigator or designee must question the subject about 
AEs by asking an open-ended question such as, “Have  you had any unusual symptoms or 
medical problems since the last visit? If yes, please describe.”  All reported or observed signs 
and symptoms will be recorded individually, except when conside red manifestations of a 
medical condition or disease state. A precise diagnosis will be recorded whenever possible. 
When such a diagnosis is made, all related signs, symptoms, and any test findings may be 
recorded collectively as a single diagnosis on the CRF and, if it is a SAE, on the SAE Form. 
The onset and end dates and times, action taken regarding study  drug, treatment administered, 
and outcome for each AE must be  recorded on the source document ation. 
The relationship of each AE to study drug treatment and study p rocedures, and the severity 
and seriousness of each AE, as judged by the Investigator, must  be recorded as described 
above. 
Subjects will be evaluated at ea ch site visit for any signs/sym ptoms of application site 
dermatitis, application site pruritus, application site erythem a, application site pain, and 
application site scaling or burning.  The Investigator’s assessment of Application Site 
Reactions will be captured in the following format within the s ource documents:

 The clinical course of each AE will be monitored at suitable in tervals until resolved or 
stabilized or returned to baseline, until the subject is referr ed for continued care to a health 
care professional or until a deter mination of a cause unrelated  to the study drug or study 
procedure is made. 
Adverse events will be coded according to MedDRA and reported w ith respect to severity, 
duration, relationship to study medication(s), seriousness and action taken. 
6.5.2.4 Reporting of serious adverse events 
To satisfy regulatory requirements, all SAEs (as described in S ection 6.5.2.1) that occur 
during the study period, regardless of judged relationship to t reatment with the study drug, 
must be reported to the Sponsor or CRO by the Investigator. The  event must be reported 
within 24 hours of when the Investigator learns about it. Compl eting the SAE form and 
reporting the event must not be delayed, even if not all the in formation is available. 
 
 
PLEASE NOTE THAT EMAIL IS THE PREFERRED MEANS OF COMMUNICATION.  
The CRO should inform the Pharmac ovigilance (PhV) unit if the w hole study is early 
discontinued due to safety reasons. It is the responsibility of the CRO to report a SAE to the FDA within proper time constraints 
as per the Guidance for Industry and Investigator ’s Safety Reporting Requirements for 
Investigational New Drugs (INDs) and Bioavailability/Bioequival ence (BA/BE) Studies – 
DEC 2012. Confirmation of submission of this report must then b e provided to Actavis, Inc.

 up clinical trial subjects in order to determine the final outc ome. If follow-up cannot be 
completed until release of CRF by the Investigator the individu al CRF will be released and 
transferred to the Clinical Data Management. In this case, foll ow-up information will be 
documented separately in the subject ’s record and outcome including a short description on 
follow-up procedures performed must be sent to the Sponsor. 
It is the Investigator’s responsibility to assure that subjects experiencing adverse rea ctions 
will receive definitive treatme nt for any adverse reaction, if required. Details of follow-up 
care are to be provided (i.e., if tr eatment or hospitalization is required).  
 
6.5.4 Pregnancy 
If a subject becomes pregnant during the study, the Investigato r will notify the Sponsor 
immediately after the pregnancy is confirmed and the subject ex its from the study after 
appropriate safety follow-up. 
All pregnancies of women participating in the study that occur during the study, or within 30 
days of completion of the study, are to be reported immediately  to the individual identified in 
the clinical study personnel contact information section of thi s protocol, and the Investigator 
must provide the Sponsor with the pregnancy form. The process f or reporting a pregnancy is 
the same as that for reporting a SAE (also see Section 6.5.2.4) .  
Any female subject becoming pregnant during the study will disc ontinue treatment. The 
Investigator will notify the subject’s physician that the subject may have b een treated with an 
investigational medication (oxymetazoline or vehicle), follow t he progress of the pregnancy 
to term, and document the outcome of the pregnancy (including spontaneous or voluntary 
termination). 
If the pregnancy continues to term, the outcome (health of the infant up to 8 weeks of age), 
including details of birth and presence or absence of any birth  defect, congenital 
abnormalities, or maternal and newborn complications, will be reported to the Sponsor. Any 
complication of pregnancy during the study and any complication  of pregnancy that the 
Investigator becomes aware of after termination from the study will be reported as an AE or 
SAE, as appropriate. 
If the pregnancy does not conti nue to term, one of the followin g actions will be taken: 
x For a spontaneous abortion, report as an SAE. 
x For an elective abortion due to developmental anomalies, report  as an SAE. 
x For an elective abortion not due to developmental anomalies, re port on the pregnancy 
form; do not report as an AE. 
 
6.6 Other Procedures and Variables 
6.6.1 Physical examination 
The physical examination (by means of inspection, palpation, au scultation) will be performed 
by the Investigator or the designated physician at the study site on the day of screening and 
Day 29. All clinical signs and symptoms that can be brought int o context with the underlying

 disease, the treatment to be administered or any relevant comor bidities (if present) should be 
assessed during the physical examination. 
At a minimum, the subject will be examined for the following as pects/symptoms but will not 
be commented on, unless there is an issue: 
x General appearance 
x Skin (paleness, jaundice, redness / rash, acneiform changes) 
x Hand and feet (signs of hand-foot syndrome / palmar-plantar ery throdysesthesia) 
x Eyes (accommodation, double images, abnormal sensitivity to lig ht, jaundice) 
x Ears, nose, throat (presence of petechial bleedings, gingiva bl eeding) 
x Head and neck 
x Lungs 
x Heart/ cardiovascular 
x Abdomen (pain, tenderness, peristal tic, ascites, organomegaly) 
x Lymph nodes 
x Musculoskeletal system and spine 
x Arms and legs (petechial bleedings, ulcer, signs of thrombosis) 
x Neurological examination  
Other clinical signs and symptoms may be investigated as well i f clinically indicated. The 
subject’s height and weight will  be recorded at screening only.   
 
6.6.2 Vital signs 
Blood pressure, heart rate and body temperature will be recorded by a member of the 
Investigator’s team at screening; at pre-dose and 12 hours on Day 1; and at pr e-dose and 12 
hours on Day 29.   
Blood pressure (millimeters of mercury [mmHg]) and heart rate ( beats per minute [bpm]) will 
be measured during the physical examination after 5 minutes res t in sitting position. Blood 
pressure and heart rate will be obtained preferably using the s ame arm and same equipment 
each time. If one arm has higher blood pressure than the other,  that arm should be used for 
further blood pressure measurements (all further blood pressure  measurements should be 
done in the same arm). 
Body temperature will be measured using the oral or tympanic thermometer with digital 
display and recorded in the eCRF in degree Celsius (°C). Prefer ably the same method will be 
used each time.  
If clinically indicated at the Investigator’s discretion, additional vital sign assessments may 
be performed at unscheduled time points.

 7 STATISTICAL AND ANAL YTICAL PLANS 
The sections described here highlight the sample size determina tions and planned analyses 
for this study. SAS Version 9.4 or higher will be used to perfo rm all the statistical analyses. A 
Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) that expands the statistical se ction of the protocol will be 
approved prior to locking the database. The SAP will provide de scriptions of the statistical 
methods, hypotheses, analysis populations to be analyzed, and t ext with table and listing 
shells. The SAP will serve as a companion to the protocol and w ill serve as the de facto 
documentation of the proposed statistical evaluation. 
The continuous data will be summarized by treatment groups usin g descriptive statistics 
(number of subjects (n), mean, standard deviation (SD), median,  minimum, and maximum). 
Categorical data will be summarized by treatment groups using f requency count (n) and 
percentages (%). 
All statistical tests will be c onducted at the 5% significance level, unless indicated otherwise. 
7.1 Sample Size Rationale

7.5 Comparability of Study Groups at Baseline 
The number and percentage of all the subjects entering and comp leting the study will be 
provided across treatment groups. Similarly, summarization of the primary reasons for 
discontinuation will be provided. The listing of subjects who d iscontinued from analysis 
population along with reasons of discontinuation will be presen ted. Descriptive statistics for 
various continuous demographic variables age (in years), height  (in cm) and weight (in kg) 
will be provided. The frequency count (n) and percentages (%) f or categorical variables will 
be provided by treatment groups for intent-to-treat (ITT) popul ation. Other baseline data will 
be tabulated and listed appropriately. Medical history will be coded using MedDRA terms. 
The frequency count and percentage of subjects will be summariz ed according to the coded 
terms of System Organ Class (SOC) and preferred term across all  the treatment groups for

 safety population. Listing for all the demographic and baseline  characteristics will be 
provided. No inferential analyses are planned. 
7.6 Safety Assessment 
Safety analyses will be performed on the safety population. No inferential analyses are 
planned. 
The extent of exposure will be su mmarized using descriptive sta tistics. Subject exposure to 
the study medication will be characterized by study duration an d treatment duration. Study 
duration will be defined as number of days from the date of fir st dosing to the date of EoT 
visit (Day 29); if the date of EoT visit is missing, the date o f the last visit will be used (i.e., 
date of study visit minus date of first dosing plus 1). Treatme nt duration will be defined as 
number of days from the date of first dosing to last dose (i.e. , date of last dose minus date of 
first dose plus 1). Study duration and  treatment duration will  be summarized using 
descriptive statistics by treatment group. Adverse events will be coded using preferred terms and primary SOC from the current 
version of MedDRA. The AEs and SAEs are considered to be treatm ent-emergent if they 
have started or worsened after first application of any study d rug up until the EoT visit. The 
incidence of TEAEs, treatment-emergent SAEs (TESAEs) and drug-r elated TEAEs and 
TESAEs will be summarized by treatment group in frequency table s. The maximum severity 
of a TEAE/TESAE experienced by a subject will be determined by the most severe rating 
recorded on the eCRF for the subject’s given TEAE. TEAEs leadin g to study discontinuation 
and treatment-related TEAEs leadi ng to study discontinuation wi ll be summarized by 
preferred term within primary SOC. Individual subject listings will be generated for TEAEs 
and TESAEs, including subject age, sex, and race, sorted by pri mary SOC, preferred term, 
onset and stop date, onset day relative to the most recent dose , relationship, and severity.
Adverse events will also be collected both for the screening an d baseline period (which will 
be referred to as pretreatment AEs). A listing of pretreatment AEs (including any SAEs) will 
be presented. Incidence of concomitant medications will be summarized by trea tment group. A listing by 
subject of all abnormal physical examination values will be pro vided. The vital signs (body 
temperature, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure and heart rate), will be 
reviewed by the Investigator or qualified delegate and will be summarized by descriptive 
statistics. 
7.7 Efficacy Assessment   
The efficacy analysis will be performed on all the subjects in mITT and PP population. Analyses will 
be conducted with the PP population for equivalence determinati on, and analyses with the mITT 
population will be for supportive  superiority purposes. The SAP  will provide descriptions of the 
statistical methods, hypotheses, and analysis populations to be  analyzed.  
7.7.1 Analysis of primary endpoint  
x Equivalence testing  
Therapeutic equivalence will be concluded if 90% continuity-cor rected confidence interval 
for the difference between test and reference products (πT –  πR) of the treatment success 
rates at all timepoints 3, 6, 9, and 12 hours post-application on Day 29 falls within the 
acceptance range of [-0.20, +0.20] using PP population.

 x Superiority testing  
A frequency distribution of subjects with at least a 2-grade de crease (improvement) on CEA 
scores by time point on Day 1 and Day 29 and by treatment group  will be tabulated. A two-
sided exact Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test, stratified by clinical site, will be applied to test 
the difference between treatment success rates at all post-appl ication timepoints on Day 29 
of Test or Reference Product and Placebo. The sensitivity of th e equivalence analysis 
(superiority of Test Product and Reference Product over Placebo ) will be established if 
active treatment success rate is higher than and statistically significantly different from (p-
value < 0.05) that of the Placebo group for each active treatme nt, using the mITT 
population. No adjustment will be made for multiplicity. 
Detailed statistical methods will be explained in SAP.  
8 ETHICS

9.3 Case Report Forms (CRFs) 
Electronic Data Capture (EDC) technology will be utilized. Elec tronic CRFs (eCRFs) will be 
prepared for all data collection fields. Study subjects will be  identified by initials, birth date 
and subject number, if applicable. Corrections to the CRF will generate an automated audit 
trail including date and timestamp, full name of the person mak ing the correction and original 
entry. The user will document the reason for the change which i s also maintained in the audit 
trail. CRFs may be reviewed and signed manually / electronicall y by properly trained and 
authorized individuals. The EDC platform will be compliant with  21 CFR (Code of Federal 
Regulations) part 11 security and audit trail requirements. 
CRFs must be kept current to reflect the study subject’s status at each phase during the course 
of the study. Study subjects are not to be identified on CRFs b y name; appropriately coded 
identification (i.e., study subject study number) and the study  subject’s  initials must be used. 
The Investigator must keep a separate log of the study subject’s  names and addresses. 
Source documents such as the clinic chart are to be maintained separately from the eCRF (in 
order to allow data verification. Due to the potential for erro rs and inaccuracies in entering 
data into CRFs, originals of laboratory and other test results must be kept on file with the 
study subject’s source document. Source documents and copies of test results m ust be 
available at all times for inspection by the study monitor. 
9.4 Primary Source Documents 
The Investigator must maintain primary source documents support ing significant data for 
each study subject’s  medical notes. These documents, which are considered “source  data”,  
should include documentation of: 
x Demographic information 
x Evidence supporting the diagnosis/condition for which the study  subject is being studied 
x General information supporting the study subject’s  participation in the study 
x General history and physical findings 
x Hospitalization or Emergency Room records (if applicable) 
x Each study visit by date, including any evaluations, relevant f indings/notes by the 
Investigator(s), occurrence (or lack) of AEs and changes in med ication usage, including 
the date the study drug commenced and completed. 
x Any additional visits during the study 
x Any relevant telephone conversations with the study subject reg arding the study or 
possible AEs 
x An original, signed ICF for study participation 
x Subject ’s diary 
The Investigator must also retain all study subject specific pr intouts/reports of

The study may be subject to audit by the Sponsor, Sponsor Repre sentative or by regulatory 
authorities. If such an audit occurs the Investigator must agre e to allow access to required 
subject records. By signing this protocol, the Investigator gra nts permission to personnel from 
the Sponsor, its representatives and appropriate regulatory aut horities for on-site monitoring 
of all appropriate study documen tation, as well as on-site revi ew of study procedures. 
The following should also be  available for review: 
1. Study Subject Screening/Enrollment Log – reflecting the reason any study subject 
screened for the study was found to be ineligible and start and  end dates for all study 
subjects  
2. Delegation of Authority / Study Personnel Signature Log – all site personnel will be listed 
along with their responsibilities and signatures; to be maintai ned at the site throughout the 
study 
3. Monitoring Log – the date and purpose of all monitoring visits by the Sponsor/d esignee 
will be documented 
4. Drug Inventory/Packing Slip – reflecting the total amount of drug shipped to the site and 
received and signed for by the Investigator 
5. Drug Accountability Log – reflecting the total amount of IP dispensed to and returned by  
each study subject 
6. Informed Consent Form – which must be available for each study subject and be verified  
for proper documentation 
7. All correspondence 
Monitoring visits will be arranged in advance at a mutually acc eptable time with site 
personnel. Sufficient time must be allowed by the site personne l for the monitoring of CRFs 
and relevant source documents. The Study Coordinator and/or Inv estigator should be 
available to answer questions or resolve data clarifications. A dequate time and space for these 
visits should be made available by the Investigator. At the end of the study, a closeout monitoring visit will be pe rformed. 
9.6 Audits and Inspections 
During the course of the study and/or after it has been complet ed, one or more site visits may 
be undertaken by auditors as authorized representatives of the Sponsor. The purpose of the 
audit is to determine whether o r not the study is being conduct ed and monitored in 
compliance with the protocol, recognized GCP guidelines and all  applicable regulations. 
Additionally, the study may be inspected by regulatory agencies . These inspections may take 
place at any time during the study or after the study.

 9.7 Modifications to the Protocol 
The procedures defined in the protocol and in the eCRF/paper CR F will be carefully 
reviewed to ensure that all parties involved with the study fully understand the protocol. In 
order to ensure the validity of the data, no deviations from th e protocol, with minimal 
exceptions, may be made unless the issue is broad enough to war rant revision of the protocol. 
Such revisions must be submitte d to and have documented approva l from the Sponsor and the 
IRB prior to implementation. All amendments to the protocol, wh ich involve substantial 
changes in study design, procedure or analyses, will be submitt ed to appropriate regulatory 
authority for prior approval. 
The only circumstance in which an amendment may be initiated wi thout prior IRB approval 
is to eliminate apparent immedia te hazards to a study subject o r study subjects. However, the 
Investigator must notify the Sponsor and the IRB as soon as pos sible. 
9.8 Completion of Study 
The Investigator is required to forward CRFs and all other rele vant data and records to CRO. 
The Investigator will complete and report (submission of CRFs) his/her study in satisfactory 
compliance with the protocol as soon as possible after the comp letion of the study. 
The Investigator must submit a final report to the IRB and CRO within one (1) month of 
study completion or discontinuation. A CSR will be prepared in accordance with ICH-GCP and Sponsor r equirements. In the event 
the study is prematurely terminated for medical reasons, the pr incipal Investigator or his/her 
authorized designee will produce an abbreviated safety report.

 11 CONFIDENTIALITY, USE OF INFORMATION, AND 
PUBLICATION 
All information supplied by the Sponsor in connection with this  study and not previously 
published, is considered confide ntial information. This informa tion includes, but is not 
limited to, data, materials (i.e., the clinical protocol, CRFs) , equipment, experience (whether 
of a scientific, technical, engi neering, operational or commerc ial nature), designs, 
specifications, know-how, product uses, processes, formulae, co sts, financial data, marketing 
plans and direct selling systems, customer lists and technical and commercial information 
relating to customers or business projections used by the Spons or in its business. Any data, 
inventions or discoveries collected or developed, as a result o f this study is considered 
confidential. This confidentia l information shall remain the so le property of the Sponsor, 
shall not be disclosed to any un authorized person or used in an y unauthorized manner without 
written consent of the Sponsor and shall not be used except in the performance of the study. 
The information developed during the course of this clinical st udy is also considered 
confidential and will be used by the Sponsor in connection with  the development of the drug. 
The information may be disclosed as deemed necessary by the Spo nsor. To allow the use of 
the information derived from this clinical study, the Investiga tor is obliged to provide the 
Sponsor with complete test results and all data developed in th e study. The information 
obtained during this study may be made available to other Inves tigators who are conducting 
similar studies.

 12 PREMATURE TERMINATION OF STUDY/SUBJECT 
A subject may terminate from the study early for any reason at any time without any 
disadvantages. In this case, the Investigator should make every  effort to have the subject 
return to the next scheduled visi t to perform all required Stud y Completion/Early Termination 
visit activities and to collect and reconcile all test articles . If the subject does not return for 
the Study Completion/Early Termination visit, the site should f ully document the reason for 
early termination. All data, including the date and primary rea son for termination, must be 
recorded on the Study Completion/Early Termination CRF, and sou rce document. 
Any subject who experiences an AE may be terminated from the st udy or from study 
treatment at any time at the discretion of the Investigator. In  this case, the subject should be 
followed at the discretion of the Investigator until the resolu tion or stabilization of the AE. 
All applicable data should be recorded in the AEs section of th e CRF. If a subject terminates 
from the study early for multiple reasons that include AEs, the  Study Completion/Early 
Termination CRF should indicate that early termination was rela ted to an AE.  
An exception to this requirement will be the occurrence of an A E that in the opinion of the 
Investigator is not severe enough to warrant early termination but that requires the use of a 
prohibited medication, thereby requiring discontinuation of the  subject. In such a case, the 
reason for discontinuation would be the need to take a prohibit ed medication, not the AE. 
The Investigator must inform the clinical project physician/cli nical leader/Principal 
Investigator as soon as possible of all subjects who are being considered for early termination 
due to AEs. Additional reports must be provided when requested.  
The Sponsor reserves the right to terminate the study at any ti me for administrative reasons. 
The study may also be terminated by regulatory authorities or b y the Investigator for his/her 
site following consultation with the Sponsor. Following a decis ion to discontinue the trial, the 
Investigator will immediately inform both the study subjects an d the IRB responsible for this 
trial within 10 working days, stating the reasons for discontin uation of the study and, 
furthermore, advise them in writing of any potential risks to the health of study subjects or 
other persons. It is Sponsor’s  responsibility to report the premature termination of the stud y 
to the regulatory agencies within 15 days providing them with t he reasons for the trial 
discontinuation and advising them in writing of any potential r isks to the health of study 
subjects or other persons. The CRO may notify the regulatory ag ency on behalf of the 
Sponsor.

64th WMA General Assembly, Fortaleza, Brazil, October 2013 
Preamble 
1. The World Medical Association (WMA) has developed the Declar ation of Helsinki as a statement of 
ethical principles for medical research involving human subject s, including research on identifiable human 
material   and data. 
The Declaration is intended to be read as a whole and each of i ts constituent paragraphs should be applied with 
consideration of all other relevant paragraphs. 
2. Consistent with the mandate of the WMA, the Declaration is a ddressed primarily to physicians. The WMA 
encourages others who are invol ved in medical research involvin g human subjects to adopt these principles. 
General Principles 
3. The Declaration of Geneva of the WMA binds the physician with the words, “The health of my patient 
will    be my first considerati on,” and the Inter national Code of Medical Ethics declares that, “A p hysician shall 
act in        the patient’s best interest when providing medica l    care.”  
4. It is the duty of the physician to promote and safeguard the  health, well-being and rights of patients, 
including those who are involved in medical research. The p hysician’s knowledge and c onscience are dedicated to 
the fulfilment of this duty. 5. Medical progress is based on research that ultimately must i nclude studies involving human subjects. 
6. The primary purpose of medical research involving human subj ects is to understand the causes, 
development and effects of diseases and improve preventive, dia gnostic and therapeutic interventions (methods, 
procedures and treatments). Even the best proven interventions must be evaluated continually through research for 
their safety, effectiveness, e fficiency, accessibility and qual ity. 
7. Medical research is subject to ethical standards that promot e and ensure respect for all human subjects and 
protect their health and rights.

Version No.: 3.0;

Confidential  Page 82 of 102 
 8. While the primary purpose of medical research is to generate new knowledge, this goal can never take 
precedence over the rights and interests of individual research  subjects. 
9. It is the duty of physicians who are involved in medical res earch to protect the life, health, dignity, 
integrity, right to self-deter mination, privacy, and confidenti ality of personal information of research subjects. The 
responsibility for the protection of research subjects must always rest with the physician or other health care professionals and never with the research subjects, even though  they have given consent. 
10. Physicians must consider the ethical, legal and regulatory norms and standards for research involving 
human subjects in their own countries as well as applicable int ernational norms and s tandards. No national or 
international ethical, legal or regulatory requirement should r educe or eliminate any of the protections for research 
subjects set forth in this Declaration. 
11. Medical research should be c onducted in a manner that minim ises possible harm to the environment. 
12. Medical research involving human subjects must be conducted only by individuals with the appropriate 
ethics and scientific education, training and qualifications. R esearch on patients or healthy volunteers requires the 
supervision of a competent and appropriately qualified physicia n or other health care professional. 
13. Groups that are underrepresen ted in medical research should  be provided appropriate access to 
participation in research. 
14. Physicians who combine medical research with medical care s hould involve their patients in research only 
to the extent that this is justified by its potential preventiv e, diagnostic or therapeutic value and if the physician 
has good reason to believe that participation in the research s tudy will not adversely affect the health of the 
patients who serve as research subjects. 
15. Appropriate compensation a nd treatment for subjects who are harmed as a result of participating in 
research must be ensured. 
Risks, Burdens and Benefits 
16. In medical practice and in medical research, most intervent ions involve risks and burdens. 
Medical research involving human subjects may only be conducted  if the importance of the objective outweighs 
the risks and burdens to the research subjects. 
17. All medical research involving human subjects must be prece ded by careful assessment of predictable 
risks and burdens to the individuals and groups involved in the  research in comparison with foreseeable benefits 
to them and to other individuals or groups affected by the cond ition under investigation. 
Measures to minimise the risks must be implemented. The risks m ust be continuously monitored, assessed and 
documented by the researcher. 18. Physicians may not be involved in a research study involving human subjects unless they are confident 
that the risks have been adequa tely assessed and can be satisfa ctorily managed. 
When the risks are found to outweigh the potential benefits or when there is conclusive proof of definitive outcomes, physicians must assess whether to continue, modify or  immediately stop the study. 
Vulnerable Groups and Individuals 
19. Some groups and individuals are particularly vulnerable and  may have an increased likelihood of being 
wronged or of incurring additional harm.

Protocol No.: OXY2018-01  
 
 
Version No.: 3.0;     
29 JAN 2020 
 
Confidential  Page 83 of 102 
 All vulnerable groups and individuals should receive specifical ly considered protection. 
20. Medical research with a vulnerable group is only justified if the research is responsive to the health needs 
or priorities of this group and the research cannot be carried out in a non-vulnerable group. In addition, this group 
should stand to benefit from the knowledge, practices or interv entions that result from the research. 
Scientific Requirements and Research Protocols 
21. Medical research involving human subjects must conform to generally accepted scientific principles, be 
based on a thorough knowledge of the  scientific literature, oth er relevant sources of i nformation, and adequate 
laboratory and, as appropriate, a nimal experimentation. The wel fare of animals used for research must be 
respected. 
22. The design and performance of each research study involving  human subjects must be clearly described 
and justified in a research protocol. 
The protocol should contain a statement of the ethical consider ations involved and should indicate how the 
principles in this Declarati on have been addressed. The protoco l should include information regarding funding, 
sponsors, institutional affiliations, potential conflicts of in terest, incentives for subjects and information regarding 
provisions for treating and/or compensating subjects who are ha rmed as a consequence of participation in the 
research study. In clinical trials, the protocol  must also describe appropriate  arrangements for post-trial provisions. 
Research Ethics Committees 
23. The research protocol must be submitted for consideration, comment, guidance and approval to the 
concerned research ethics committee before the study begins. Th is committee must be transparent in its 
functioning, must be independent of the researcher, the sponsor  and any other undue influence and must be duly 
qualified. It must take into consideration the laws and regulat ions of the country or countries in which the research 
is to be performed as well as a pplicable international norms an d standards but these must not be allowed to reduce 
or eliminate any of the protections for research subjects set f orth in this Declaration. 
The committee must have the r ight to monitor ongoing studies. The researcher must provide monitoring 
information to the committee, especially information about any serious adverse events. No amendment to the 
protocol may be made without consideration and approval by the committee. After the end of the study, the 
researchers must submit a final report to the committee contain ing a summary of the study’s findings and 
conclusions. 
Privacy and Confidentiality 
24. Every precaution must be taken to protect the privacy of re search subjects and the c onfidentiality of their 
personal information. 
Informed Consent 
25. Participation by individuals capable of giving informed con sent as subjects in medical research must be 
voluntary. Although it may be appropriate to consult family members or community leaders, no individual capable of giving informed consent may be enrolled in a research study unless he or she freely  agrees. 
26. In medical research involving human subjects capable of giv ing informed consent, each potential subject 
must be adequately informed of the aims, methods, sources of fu nding, any possible conflicts of interest, 

 
 
TEVA Pharmaceuticals USA,Inc.  
Protocol No.: OXY2018-01  
 
 
Version No.: 3.0;

Confidential  Page 84 of 102 
 institutional affiliations of the researcher, the anticipated b enefits and potential risks of the study and the 
discomfort it may entail, post-study provisions and any other r elevant aspects of the study. The potential subject 
must be informed of the right to refuse to participate in the s tudy or to withdraw consent to participate at any time 
without reprisal. Special attent ion should be given to the spec ific information needs of individual potential 
subjects as well as to the methods used to deliver the informat ion. 
After ensuring that the potential subject has understood the information, the physician or another appropriately 
qualified individual must then seek the potential subject’s fre ely-given informed consent, preferably in writing. If 
the consent cannot be expressed in writing, the non-written con sent must be formally documented and witnessed. 
All medical research subjects should be given the option of being informed about the general outcome and results of the study. 
27. When seeking informed consent for participation in a resear ch study the physician must be particularly 
cautious if the potential subject is in a dependent relationshi p with the physician or may consent under duress. In 
such situations the informed consent must be sought by an appro priately qualified individual who is completely 
independent of this relationship. 
28. For a potential research subject who is incapable of giving informed consent, the physician must seek 
informed consent from the legally authorised representative. Th ese individuals must not be included in a research 
study that has no likelihood of benefit for them unless it is intended to promote the health of the group represented by the potential subject, the re search cannot instead be perfor med with persons capable of providing informed 
consent, and the research entails only minimal risk and minimal  burden. 
29. When a potential research subject who is deemed incapable o f giving informed consent is able to give 
assent to decisions about participation in research, the physic ian must seek that assent in addition to the consent of 
the legally authorised representative. The potential subject’s dissent should be respected.  
30. Research involving subjects who are physically or mentally incapable of giving consent, for example, 
unconscious patients, may be don e only if the physical or menta l condition that prevents giving informed consent 
is a necessary characteristic of the research group. In such ci rcumstances the physician must seek informed 
consent from the legally authorised representative. If no such representative is available and if the research cannot be delayed, the study may proceed without informed consent prov ided that the specific reasons for involving 
subjects with a condition that re nders them unable to give info rmed consent have been s tated in the research 
protocol and the study has been a pproved by a research ethics c ommittee. Consent to remain in the research must 
be obtained as soon as possible from the subject or a legally a uthorised representative. 
31. The physician must fully inform the patient which aspects o f their care are related to the research. The 
refusal of a patient to participate in a study or the patient’s  decision to withdraw from the study must never 
adversely affect the patient-physician relationship. 
32. For medical research using identifiable human material or d ata, such as research on material or data 
contained in biobanks or similar r epositories, physicians must seek informed consent for i ts collection, storage 
and/or reuse. There may be exceptional situations where consent  would be impossible or impracticable to obtain 
for such research. In such situations the research may be done only after consideration and approval of a research 
ethics committee. 
Use of Placebo 
33. The benefits, risks, burdens and effectiveness of a new int ervention must be tested against those of the best 
proven intervention(s), except in the following circumstances:

Protocol No.: OXY2018-01  
 
 
Version No.: 3.0;     
29 JAN 2020 
 
Confidential  Page 85 of 102 
 Where no proven intervention e xists, the use of placebo, or no intervention, is acceptable; or 
Where for compelling and scientifically sound methodological reasons the use of any intervention less effective 
than the best proven one, the us e of placebo, or no interventio n is necessary to determine the efficacy or safety of 
an intervention 
and the patients who receive any intervention less effective th an the best proven one, p lacebo, or no intervention 
will not be subject to additional risks of serious or irreversi ble harm as a result of not receiving the best proven 
intervention. Extreme care must be taken to avoid abuse of this option. 
Post-Trial Provisions 
34. In advance of a clinical trial, sponsors, researchers and h ost country governments should make provisions 
for post-trial access for all participants who still need an in tervention identified as beneficial in the trial. This 
information must also be disclosed to participants during the i nformed consent process. 
Research Registration and Publication and Dissemination of Resu lts 
35. Every research study involving human subjects must be regis tered in a publicly acce ssible database before 
recruitment of the first subject. 36. Researchers, authors, sponsors, editors and publishers all have ethical obligations with regard to the 
publication and dissemination of t he results of research. Researchers have a duty to make publicly available the 
results of their research on hu man subjects and are accountable  for the completeness and accuracy of their reports. 
All parties should adhere to accepted guidelines for ethical re porting. Negative and inconclusive as well as 
positive results must be published or otherwise made publicly a vailable. Sources of funding, institutional 
affiliations and conflicts of interest must be declared in the publication. Reports of research not in accordance 
with the principles of this Declaration should not be accepted for publication. 
Unproven Interventions in Clinical Practice 
37. In the treatment of an individual patient, where proven interventions do not exist or other known interventions have been ineffec tive, the physician, after seeki ng expert advice, with informed consent from the 
patient or a legally authorised representative , may use an unproven intervention if in the physician’s judgem ent it 
offers hope of saving life, re-establishing health or alleviati ng suffering. This intervention should subsequently be 
made the object of research, designed to evaluate its safety an d efficacy. In all cases, new information must be 
recorded and, where appropriate , made publicly available.

 Because clinical trials are conducted under varying conditions,  adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a 
drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. 
A total of 489 subjects with persistent facial erythema associated with rosacea were treated with RHOFADE once daily 
for 4 weeks in 3 controlled clinical trials. An additional 440 subjects with persistent facial erythema associated with 
rosacea were also treated with RHOFADE once daily for up to one  year in a long-term (open- label) clinical trial. Adverse 
reactions that occurred in at least 1% of subjects treated with  RHOFADE through 4 weeks of treatment are presented in 
Table 1 below.

 Risk Summary 
There are no available data on RHOFADE use in pregnant women to  inform a drug-associated risk for major birth 
defects and miscarriage. A literature article describing intran asal decongestant use in pregnant women identified a 
potential association between second-trimester exposure to oxym etazoline (with no decongestant exposure in the first 
trimester) and renal collecting system anomalies [see Data] . In animal reproduction studies, there were no adverse 
developmental effects observed after oral administration of oxy metazoline hydrochloride in pregnant rats and rabbits at 
systemic exposures up to 3 times and 73 times, respectively, th e exposure associated with the maximum 
recommended human dose (MRHD) [see Data] . The estimated background risks of major birth defects and mis carriage 
for the indicated population are unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse 
outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectiv ely. 
 
Clinical Considerations 
Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions 
Following repeated use of oxymetazoline hydrochloride solution nasal spray for the treatment of nasal congestion at a 
dose 5 times higher than recommended, one case of fetal distres s was reported in a 41-week pregnant patient. The fetal 
distress resolved hours later, prior to the delivery of the hea lthy infant. The anticipated exposures for the case are 8- 
to18-fold higher than plasma exposures after topical administra tion of RHOFADE. 
Data 
Human Data 
No adequate and well-controlled trials of RHOFADE have been con ducted in pregnant women. Across all clinical trials of 
RHOFADE, two pregnancies were reported. One pregnancy resulted in the delivery of a healthy child. One pregnancy 
resulted in a spontaneous aborti on, which was considered to be unrelated to the trial medication. A literature article 
summarizing the results of exploratory analyses of intranasal d econgestant use during pregnancy identified a potential 
association between second-trimester exposure to oxymetazoline hydrochloride solution (with no decongestant exposure 
in the first trimester) and renal  collecting system anomalies. 
 
Animal Data 
Effects on embryo-fetal development were evaluated in rats and rabbits following oral administration of oxymetazoline 
hydrochloride during the period of organogenesis. Oxymetazoline  hydrochloride did not cause adverse effects to the fetus 
at oral doses up to 0.2 mg/kg/day in pregnant rats during the p eriod of organogeneisis (3 times the MRHD on an AUC 
c o m p a r i s o n  b a s i s ) .  O x y m e t a z o l i n e  h y d r o c h l o r i d e  d i d  n o t  c a u s e  a d verse effects to the fetus at oral doses up to 1 
mg/kg/day in pregnant rabbits during the period of organogeneis is (73 times the MRHD on an AUC comparison basis). 
Maternal toxicity, such as decre ased maternal body weight, was produced at the high dose of 1 mg/kg/day in pregnant 
rabbits and was associated with findings of delayed skeletal os sification. 
 
In a rat perinatal and postnatal  development study, oxymetazoli ne hydrochloride was orally administered to pregnant rats 
once daily from gestation day 6 through lactation day 20. Mater nal toxicity was produced at the high dose of 0.2 
mg/kg/day (3 times the MRHD on an AUC comparison basis) in preg nant rats and was associated with an increase in 
pup mortality and reduced pup body weights. Delayed sexual maturation was noted at 0.1 and 0.2 mg/kg/day (2 times the MRHD and 3 times the MRHD on an AUC comparison basis, respectiv ely). Oxymetazoline hydrochloride did not have 
any adverse effects on fetal development at a dose of 
0.05 mg/kg/day (one-half of the MRHD on an AUC comparison basis ).

 8.2 Lactation  
No clinical data are available to assess the effects of oxymeta zoline on the quantity or rate of breastmilk production, or 
to establish the level of oxymetazoline present in human breast milk post-dose. Oxymetazoline was detected in the 
milk of lactating rats. The developmental and health benefits o f breastfeeding should be considered along with the 
mother’s clinical need for RHOFADE an d any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from RHOFADE or from 
the underlying maternal condition. 
 
8.4 Pediatric Use 
Safety and effectiveness of RHOFADE have not been established in pediatric patients below the age of 18 years. 
 
8.5 Geriatric Use 
One hundred and ninety-three sub jects aged 65 years and older r eceived treatment with RHOFADE (n = 135) or vehicle 
(n = 58) in clinical trials. No overall differences in safety o r effectiveness were observed b etween subjects > 65 years of 
age and younger subjects, based on available data. Clinical stu dies of RHOFADE did not include sufficient numbers of 
subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond dif ferently from younger subjects. 
 
10 OVERDOSAGE 
RHOFADE is not for oral use. If oral ingestion occurs, seek med ical advice. Monitor patient closely and administer 
appropriate supportive measures as necessary. Accidental ingest ion of topical solutions (nasal sprays) containing 
imidazoline derivatives (e.g., oxymetazoline) in children has r esulted in serious adverse events requiring hospitalization, 
including nausea, vomiting, lethargy, tachycardia, decreased re spiration, bradycardia, hypotension, hypertension, 
sedation, somnolence, mydriasis , stupor, hypothermia, drooling,  and coma. Keep RHOFADE out of reach of children.

 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 
12.1 Mechanism of Action 
Oxymetazoline is an alpha 1A adrenoceptor agonist.  Oxymetazol ine acts as a vasoconstrictor.  
 
12.2 Pharmacodynamics 
The pharmacodynamics of RHOFADE has not been studied. 
 
12.3 Pharmacokinetics 
Absorption 
The pharmacokinetics of oxymetazoline was evaluated following t opical administration of RHOFADE in a thin layer to 
cover the entire face in adult subjects with erythema associate d with rosacea. The median weight of cream for each dose 
administration was 0.3 g. Plasma oxymetazoline concentrations w ere measurable in most of the subjects. Following the 
first dose application, the mean ± standard deviation (SD) peak  concentrations (Cmax) and area under the concentration-
time curves from time 0 to 24 hours (AUC 0-24hr ) were 60.5 ± 53.9 pg/mL and 895 ±798 pg*hr/mL, respectively. Following 
once daily applications fo r 28 days, the mean ± SD Cmax and AUC 0-24hr were 66.4 ± 67.1 pg/mL and 1050 ± 992 
pg*hr/mL, respectively. Following twice daily applications (twi ce the recommended frequency of application) for 28 days, 
the mean ± SD C max and AUC 0-24hr were 68.8 ± 61.1 pg/mL and 1530 ± 922 pg*hr/mL, respectively. 
Distribution 
An in vitro study demonstrated that oxymetazoline is 56.7% to 5 7.5% bound to human plasma proteins. 
Metabolism 
In vitro studies using human liver microsomes showed that oxyme tazoline was minimally metabolized, generating 
mono-oxygenated and dehydrogenated products of oxymetazoline. T he percentage of parent drug oxymetazoline 
remaining was 95.9% after a 120-mi nute incubation with human li ver microsomes. 
Excretion 
The excretion of oxymetazoline f ollowing administration of RHOF ADE has not been characterized in humans. 
Drug Interaction 
In vitro studies using human liver microsomes demonstrated that  oxymetazoline up to the tested concentration of 100 
nM had no inhibition on the activities of the cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoenzymes 1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, and 
3A4/5. Treatment of cultured human hepatocytes with up to 100 n M oxymetazoline did not induce CYP1A2, CYP2B6, or 
CYP3A4. 
 
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 
13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility 
Oxymetazoline hydrochloride was not associated with an increase d incidence of neoplastic or proliferative changes in 
transgenic mice given oral doses of 0.5, 1.0, or 2.5 mg/kg/day oxymetazoline hydrochloride for 6 months. 
Oxymetazoline hydrochloride revealed no evidence of mutagenic o r clastogenic potential based on the results of two in 
vitro genotoxicity tests (Ames assay and human lymphocyte chrom osomal aberration assay) and one in vivo gentoxicity 
test (mouse micronucleus assay).

 Effects on fertility and early embryonic development were evalu ated in rats following oral administration of 0.05, 0.1, or 0.2 
mg/kg/day oxymetazoline hydrochloride prior to and during matin g and through early pregnancy. Decreased number of 
corpora lutea and increased post-implantation losses were noted  at 0.2 mg/kg/day oxymetazoline hydrochloride (3 times 
the MRHD on an AUC comparison basis). However, no treatment rel ated effects on fertility or mating parameters were 
noted at 0.2 mg/kg/day oxymetazo line hydrochloride (3 times the  MRHD on an AUC comparison basis). 
 
14 CLINICAL STUDIES 
RHOFADE was evaluated for the treatment of persistent erythema associated with rosacea in two identical, 
randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled, parallel-group cl inical trials. The trials enrolled 885 subjects aged 18 
years and older. Overall, 90% of subjects were Caucasian and 79 % were female. Subjects applied either RHOFADE 
or vehicle once daily for 29 days. 
Disease severity was graded by the clinician using a 5-point cl inician erythema assessment (CEA) scale and by the 
subject on a similar 5-point subject self-assessment (SSA) scale, on which subjects scored either “moderate” or “severe” 
on both scales. 
CEA and SSA were measured over a 12-hour period at equally-spac ed timepoints (hours 3, 6, 9, and 12) post- dose on 
Days 1, 15, and 29. The primary efficacy endpoint was defined a s the proportion of subjects with at least a 2-grade 
reduction in erythema (improvement) from baseline (pre-dose on Day 1) on both the CEA and SSA measured at hours 
3, 6, 9, and 12 on Day 29. The results from both trials on the composite endpoint for Day 29 are presented in Table 2.

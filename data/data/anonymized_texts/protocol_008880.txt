2. INTRODUCTION 
 
2.1. Study Background and Rationale 
 
Catheter -associated urinary tract infections (CAUTI) are one of the most common hospital -acquired 
infections (HAI), accounting for more than 15% HAIs in the United States.1 On October 1, 2008, the 
Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) s topped reimbursing hospitals for treatment of 
preventable HAIs.2 Subsequently, hospitals have implemented CAUTI prevention bundles to reduce 
these largely  preventable,  costly,  and morbid  infections. Guidelines for the prevention of CAUTI  focus 
on the follo wing  four aspects  of prevention: appropriate device  utilization,  aseptic insertion  technique, 
proper care/maintenance of the catheter, and timely removal of the urinary  catheter.  
 
Several interventions seeking to reduce CAUTIs have studied the impact of chlorhexidine gluconate 
(CHG) bathing in the intensive care unit (ICU) but have not found a significant effect.3-7 Though one 
study did find a significant reduction in high-level  (>50,000 colony- forming  units) candiduria and any 
level of bacteriuria with CHG bathing, the study did not evaluate the impact on CAUTI rates, nor did it investigate the effect of perineal care and maintenance following catheter insertion.
8 Additionally, 
the expanded  use of CHG  carries  with it the potential for development of CHG -resistant  bacteria which 
could compromise its use for surgical site infection  prevention. 
 
Few studies have exclusively  investigated  the effect  of catheter  care and maintenance on CAUTI  rate. 
ReadyCleanse® meatal and perineal cleansing cloth by Medline Industries, Inc. (hereafter 
ReadyCleanse®) is a set of five prepackaged cloths including a gender -specific, five- step cleansing 
process  clearly  described  on label  that is designed  to minimize  transfer  of bacteria to the patient  during 
catheter care. Moreover, it does not contain ingredients that are bactericidal or bacteriostatic, thereby 
reducing the risk of compromising interventions such as CHG prior to surgery due to overuse. Thus, 
ReadyCleanse® provides an easy-to-use, efficient,  and standardized  means  of conducting catheter  care 
that may significantly reduce CAUTI rates compared to  standard-of- care.  
 
2.2. Risk/Benefit  Assessment  
 
ReadyCleanse® cloths are currently marketed products in the United States that are intended for 
meatal and perineal care, including when a patient has an indwelling urinary catheter (IUC)  inserted. 
In this study, ReadyCleanse® cloths will be used strictly in accordance with their current labeling. 
ReadyCleanse® cloths were evaluated for safety through a repeat insult patch testing (RIPT) study in 
adults and a pediatric safety in use study. Based on the results of the RIPT study, it was concluded 
that ReadyCleanse® cloths  did not have potential for eliciting dermal irritation or inducing 
sensitization.9 Based on the results of the pediatric safety in use study, it was concluded that 
ReadyCleanse® cloths did not demonstrate a potential to cause  skin irritation  for the study duration.10 
Taken together, the risk to patients through use of the ReadyCleanse® cleansing cloths is minimal.  In 
terms of benefit, it is possible that patients in this study may directly receive a benefit. The majority 
of satellite hospitals within the main site currently use soap -and-water for their catheter care and 
maintenance, which has the potential to become contaminated and transfer bacteria to the patient,

 especially when the cleansing is not done in a standardized, systematic way. I f the use of 
ReadyCleanse® cloths and the cleansing process described on label does reduce CAUTI, as is 
hypothesized, many patients in the study may have had a CAUTI prevented. Additionally, the 
reduction of CAUTI with the use of ReadyCleanse® could furthe r develop global best practices for 
catheter care and maintenance to avoid CAUTIs. In sum, the benefits in this study outweigh the 
minimal risk presented to participants in the study.  
 
3. OBJECTIVES AND ENDPOINTS  
 
 
OBJECTIVES  ENDPOINTS  JUSTIFICATION FOR  
ENDPOINTS  
Primary    
Evaluate if ReadyCleanse® 
cleansing cloths reduce CAUTI 
when used to perform catheter care 
and maintenance.  The primary endpoint will be 
incidence of CAUTI, measured per 
1000 catheter  days.  The rate during the 
intervention will be compared to the 
historical rate for the facilities for the 
period preceding the intervention.  This endpoint was 
chosen as it is a direct 
measure of the objective 
of the study, using well - 
accepted  criteria.  
Secondary    
Evaluate if use of ReadyCleanse® 
cloths reduces bacteria counts in 
urine. This may provide a 
mechanistic account of any 
reduction in CAUTI. Number of colony forming units 
(cfu/ml) of bacteria in urine from a 
random sub- sample of participants in 
the interve ntion, compared to a 
random sample collected prior to the 
intervention beginning.  This endpoint is a  direct 
measure the objective, 
using well -accepted 
methodology. 
Exploratory  
Evaluate the financial impact of 
using ReadyCleanse® cloths as the  
standard -of-care for catheter care 
and maintenance.  Cost savings  in dollars  through 
avoided CAUTIs, taking into account  
the cost of the product over the 
standard -of-care.  Common measure of 
financial savings used  
in Health Economics 
Outcomes Research  
Gain feedback from healthcare 
professionals on the use of the 
product. Healthcare professionals who 
administer the intervention will be 
asked to fill out a questionnaire 
(Appendix 11.2) about their 
experience with the product. Mean  
values from  a four-choice scale  will be 
computed for descriptive  purposes.  Common  survey

 4. STUDY DESIGN AND INTERVENTION 
4.1. Overall  Design  
 
This is an open-label, superiority study intended to determine if IUC care and maintenance with a 
prepackaged cloth and standardized cleansing process (ReadyCleanse® Meatal and Perineal 
Cleansing  Cloth) can reduce CAUTI  relative  to standard -of-care.  Four  northern  suburban Chicago 
acute- care hospitals, all within the same system (NorthShore University Health System), will 
implement ReadyCleanse® as the standard -of-care for catheter care and maintenance. An initial 
training period of six weeks will first occu r, during which medical staff will be trained on the 
appropriate use of the product, and have several  weeks  to become accustomed  to it. Following this 
six-week training period, data will be collected on incidence of CAUTI prospectively for the 
duration until all expected catheter days (42,672) have been completed. The incidence rate of 
CAUTI  during the intervention  period will be compared  to the incidence rate for a similar  number 
of catheter  days prior to the six-week  training  period. A significant reduction  in CAUTI  rate during 
the intervention period will be taken as evidence of the ReadyCleanse® cloths and standardized 
cleansing process likely reducing CAUTI. The end of the study will coincide with the 42,672 
catheter days, at which point the study should be adequately powered (see Section 8). 
 
The choice of using a retrospective control was due to balancing the need for a high volume of 
catheter days in order to adequately power the study, and conducting the study in a reasonable 
timeframe (see section 8). During the intervention period, all four hospitals will continue using 
their baseline CAUTI bundle prevention measures, and no additional new interventions will take 
place during the study period. Also, given that this study is using the ReadyCleanse® cloths per 
their intended use and implementing the intervention simultaneously across the entire  hospital 
system, it takes the form of a quality improvement initiative whereby the use of a retrospective 
control is commonly used. Nonetheless, conclusions drawn from this study will emphasize the 
intervention as a whole, such as staff training on how to use the cloths, instructions for how often 
to use the cloth, as well as the properties of the ReadyCleanse® cloths and standardized cleansing 
process, in order to make the appropriate conclusion given the known limitations of the use of a 
retrospective co ntrol. 
 
4.2. Investigational Product  
 
The intervention in this study will be the implementation of ReadyCleanse® cloths and the 
standardized cleansing process detailed on label as the new procedure for catheter care and 
maintenance across all four hospitals. Th is cloth is a currently marketed product which contains a 
pH-balanced, hypoallergenic solution. ReadyCleanse® cloths are specially designed for 
comprehensive meatal and perineal care to reduce the risk of developing a catheter -associated 
urinary tract infe ction (CAUTI). Each package contains five ReadyCleanse® cloths and a 
standardized cleansing protocol available on label. A copy of the product labeling and cleansing 
protocol is available in Appendix 11.1. Cleansing  with ReadyCleanse® cloths and the standardized 
procedure will take place twice during a 24 -hour period and after an incontinent episode.

 4.3. Control Group  
 
A retrospective control group will be used to compare the efficacy of the intervention. The 
standard -of-care for catheter care and  maintenance at NorthShore hospitals is soap- and-water 
cleansing. Thus, the ReadyCleanse® cloth and cleansing process will be compared to soap -and- 
water  cleansing.  The ICU of one of the hospitals recently  switched  to using a different  method for 
catheter  care.  Consequently, data from  this unit will  not be added  to the retrospective dataset,  but 
this unit will participate in the intervention and have their prospective data pooled with the other 
units and hospitals. 
 
4.4. Study  Intervention  
 
The study intervention will consist of two phases. An “Educational Intervention” will serve as a 
wash -in period and will take place in the first six weeks of the study; during this period of time 
clinical staff at all four hospitals will be trained on the proper usage of ReadyCleanse® and will 
gain experience using it in the clinical  setting  before  data collection  begins. The second  phase will 
be a 42,672- catheter day -period, where data on CAUTI incidence will be collected while the 
ReadyCleanse® cloth and standardized process is in use for catheter care and maintenance.  Figure  
4.1 depicts the flow of the intervention.

5.3. Other Considerations 
 
Given  that this intervention will become the new standard -of-care with respect  to catheter  care and 
maintenance in the hospital system, as is appropriate given the product’s indications for use, we 
will not be screening participants (other than age), actively recruiting, or obtaining informed consent. All HIPAA rules will be strictly observed at all times in order to minimize any breaches of patient privacy and confidentiality (please see Section 9 for more  details).  
 
6. STUDY PROCEDURE  
6.1. Events Prior to  Intervention  
 
Clinical staff at the sites will receive training by a Medline Industries, Inc. Clinical Research 
Associate (CRA) and/or Clinical Product Specialist on the use of the ReadyCleanse® cloths and 
the standardized cleansing procedure prior to the start of Ready Cleanse® cloth use. Medline staff 
will offer training  sessions to NorthShore health  care providers who perform  IUC routine catheter 
care (e.g. patient care technicians, staff nurses, etc.) during all shifts at each hospital to ensure 
effective and consistent use of the product. The training  will also be offered  to NorthShore Clinical 
Care Coordinators, Nurse Educators, and Study Research Nurses, along with NorthShore clinical 
research staff. Nurse Educators will be responsible for training newly hired personnel or any staff 
that could not attend  the training sessions;  Nurse  Educators should document all training  sessions. 
Training materials will be a combination of a Medline -produced product use video, review of 
ReadyCleanse® cloth package instructions, and pre -printed handouts. Medline staff members will 
be available to assist if any questions arise from the healthcare providers during the course of the 
study. ReadyBath Intelligent Warmers (Appendix 11.1), which are used to ke ep the 
ReadyCleanse® cloths warm to enhance patient comfort, will be placed on the floors. Positioning 
of the ReadyBath Warmers will be jointly determined by Medline and each of the four study hospital IPs in conjunction with the NorthShore research staff;  in some instances it may not be 
possible to place ReadyBath Warmers due to spatial constraints. As the warming of the product is not essential to its efficacy, this is not anticipated to present a problem in interpreting the study 
results.  
6.2. Wash- in Period/ Educational Intervention 
 
The first six weeks of the study will be dedicated to ensuring all staff members who perform 
catheter care and maintenance are adequately trained on the process of using the ReadyCleanse® 
cloths and to gain experience in using them. Training will take place as described in 6.1. Once trained, staff will begin using ReadyCleanse
® cloths and the standardized cleansing process for 
perineal care. During this period, no data will be collected pertaining to the efficacy of the 
interventio n.

 Following the Educational Intervention, all hospital staff will be sufficiently trained in the use of 
ReadyCleanse® and the 42,672- catheter day -data collection period will begin. All participants 
requiring an IUC during their hospital stay will be considered enrolled in the study, and assigned 
a subject number. A master list linking subject numbers to patient name and medical record 
number will be maintained in a secure electronic database by the staff at No rthShore University 
Health System. This database will be maintained at the research site at all times.  
 
During this time, use of ReadyCleanse® cloths and the standardized cleansing procedure will be 
the standard -of-care for catheter  care and maintenance;  patients  will undergo routine perineal  care 
for a minimum of twice per day and after each incontinent episode. The specific cleansing 
procedure for ReadyCleanse® is provided in Appendix 11.1.2. 
 
6.3.1.  Data Collection  Procedures  
 
6.3.1.1.  Prospective Data  Collection  
 
During the data collection period, the Study Coordinator at the university health 
system will extract the relevant data from all patients who had an IUC during their hospital admission. Data will be extracted from the participant’s Electronic Health Record  (EHR) in Epic (www.epic.com) and transferred into both an Excel 
spreadsheet and a paper Case Report Form (CRF) by NorthShore study staff; a sample of the CRF is provided in Appendix 11.5. The following data will be collected for each participant enrolled in the study and entered into his/her CRF: 
 
Demographic and general health information 
 
 Age 
 Gender  
 Race  
 Hospital within NorthShore system  
 Hospital room during stay

CAUTI data  
 
 Additional data will be collected on each participant who develops a CAUTI, 
including a urine culture. The full list of additional data collected on patients with a CAUTI is available sample CRF found in Appendix 11.5. This additional data collection  is part of the standard  practice within  the NorthShore 
University Health System for anyone who develops a CAUTI.  
 
6.3.1.1.1.  CAUTI  Definition  
 
Patients will be deemed to have had a CAUTI using the criteria currently defined  by the Centers  for Disease Control (CDC),  which  can be found here: 
https://www.cdc.gov/nhsn/pdfs/ps cmanual/7psccauticurrent.pdf  
 
6.3.1.1.2.  Urine  culture 
 
Quantitative urine cultures  will be obtained from patients with IUC in-situ 
for at least 5 -7 days. Twenty randomly selected IUC specimens will be 
obtained during the Educational Intervention period and another 20 samples 
during the study. Urine will be collected by the research coordinator from the IUC and transported to the research microbiology laboratory at NorthShore in a sterile,  leak-proof container  labeled  with patient’s  study ID 
number. 1ul and 10ul loops will be used to streak a blood agar plate and 
MacConkey agar plate. Both plates will be incubated at 35°C in a non- CO
2 
incubator and inspected for growth of bacteria after 18- 24 hours of 
incubation. Individual bacterial colonies will be identified using Mat rix 
Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization- Time of Flight (MALDI -TOF) mass 
spectrometry and quantity of organism calculated. The CRF specific to this 
portion of the study is provided in Appendix 11.6. Finally, all participants 
who develop a CAUTI  will have a urine culture performed  to determine  the 
causative bacteria and susceptibility  pattern. 
 
6.3.1.1.3.  HCP  Feedback  
 
Information pertaining to HCP acceptance of the product will be collected online in Survey Monkey; a link to the survey will be provided via e -mail. 
Appendix 11.2 provides the form that will be entered into Survey Monkey 
for HCPs  to complete.  This will take place  approximately  in Month 3 of the 
study. All participating HCPs will be sent an email (Appendix 11.7)  asking 
them to fill out an anonymous survey. The survey will be used to gain feedback  from  HCPs  on the use of the product. It will be stressed  that the

 survey is anonymous and the HCPs decision whether or not to participate 
will not affect th eir current or future status at NorthShore. Only one 
feedback  survey  questionnaire will be completed  per HCP  regardless  of the 
amount of care provided. 
 
 
6.3.1.2.  Retrospective Data Collection  
 
The CAUTI rate during the retrospective portion of the study is already collected; this rate will be compared to the CAUTI rate during the prospective portion of the study. Additionally, the CRF in 11.5 will be completed for any patient who had an IUC and developed a CAUTI in the similar number of catheter days as that of the 
intervention period, prior to the six -week training period. . These data will be 
extracted from the participants EHR from the sites electronic data warehouse and entered onto the CRF i n the same fashion as the prospective data collection. Data 
from CRFs for participants in the retrospective arm will be transferred to the same electronic database as the prospective data for statistical analysis.  
 
6.3.2.  Compliance with  Intervention/Auditing 
 
During the study, random on- site observations of perineal care will be performed by 
research study coordinators. The study coordinators will directly observe the performance of perineal care for 10 IUC patients at each hospital and adherence to the written protocol will be determined. For sites that have adherence rates below the 90th percentile, we will acquire an additional 10 more observations to reduce the effect of sampling error. Observations of perineal care will be performed during the first seven months of the data collection portion of the intervention, with a goal that all audits are complete within three months. 
 
Due to extension  of the study,  the second  (and subsequent, if required) set of audits will be 
executed by Medline Industries, Inc., in corroboration with NorthShore University Health 
System
. 
 
7. SAFETY  ASSESSMENT  
Given that the intervention in this study utilizes a low -risk product in accordance with its intended 
use and labeling, the safety risk to participants is minimal. Participants will b e routinely monitored 
as they will be in the acute -care setting during the study, and will have their perineum and meatus 
inspected regularly for any signs of irritation. Adverse Events, as described below, will be collected 
for all participants and review ed by the PI.

 During this st udy, the ReadyCleanse® cloth will be used in accordance with its labeling 
and intended use, presenting minimal risk to the participants. Consequently, the 
definitions for Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events listed below will be used in the course of this study. 
 
7.1.1.  Definition  of Adverse Events (AE)  
 
If the condition of the participant’s perineal skin and soft- tissue deteriorates  unexpectedly, 
per the PI’s interpretation,  or if there is a new condition that the PI determines  is not related 
to the baseline health condition but could be related to the use of the study product, it will be recorded as an AE.  
 
7.1.2.  Definition of Serious Adverse Events (SAE)  
 
Any AE that results in any of the following outcomes: Death, life -threatening event, 
requires or prolongs inpatient hospitaliza tion, results in persistent or significant disability 
or incapacity, results in a congenital anomaly or birth defect, results in an important medical or event or requires medical intervention to prevent one of these outcomes. All AEs that are identified as  per 7.1.1 will have Investigator determination of SAE and will 
have documented appropriate medical care for the event available in the EHR.  
 
7.2. Classification of an Adverse Event  
 
7.2.1.  Severity of  Event 
 
The severity of all adverse events will be graded on a scal e of one through five according to the most 
recent version of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events guideline, where each grade represents a unique clinical description based on this general guideline: 
 
• Grade 1: Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observation only; 
intervention not indicated.  
• Grade 2: Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limited age - 
appropriate instrumental activities of daily  living.  
• Grade  3: Severe or medically  significant  but not immediately  life-threatening; hospitalization 
or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting activities of daily living 
involving self-care.  
• Grade 4: Life threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated  
• Grade 5: Death related to  AE 
 
7.2.2.  Relatedness of  Event

 All adverse  events  (AEs) must have their relationship  to study intervention assessed  by the PI 
who examines  and evaluates  the participant  based  on temporal  relationship  and his/her clinical 
judgment. The degree of certainty about causality will be graded using the categories below. 
 
• Unrelated : This category applies to those adverse events which, after careful consideration, 
are clearly and incontrovertibly due to extraneous causes (disease, environment, etc.) 
• Possible : This category applies to those adverse events for which, after careful medical 
consideration at the time they are evaluated, a connection with the Investigational Product 
administration appears unlikely but cannot be ruled out with certainty.  
• Probable : This category applies to those adverse events which, after careful medical 
consideration at the time they are evaluated, are felt with a high degree of certainty to be related to the Investigational Product. 
• Definite : This category  applies to those adverse events  which, after careful  consideration, are 
clearly and incontrovertibly due to the Investigational Product. 
 
7.2.3.  Expectedness  
 
The PI will be responsible for determining whether an AE is expected or unexpected. An AE will be considered unexpected if the nature, severity, or frequency of the event is not consistent with the risk information previously described for the study intervention. One AE that may occur during the study is mild irritation at the cleansing site.  
 
7.2.4.  Relatedness of Event Time Period & Frequency of Event Assessment and Follow- Up 
 
All AEs and SAEs will be captured on the appropriate reporting form. Information to be  
collected includes event description, time of onset, clinician’s assessment of severity, relationship to study product (assessed only by those with the training and authority to make a diagnosis), and time of resolution/stabilization of the event. All AEs  and SAEs as 
defined in section 7.1 occurring while on study must be documented appropriately regardless of relationship. All AEs will be followed to adequate resolution. 
 
Changes  in the severity  of an AE will be documented to allow  an assessment  of the duration 
of the event at each level of severity. Changes in severity will necessitate a new CRF to document the new level of severity. AEs characterized as intermittent require documentation of onset and duration of each episode.  
 
The PI will record  all reportable events  with start dates  occurring  any time after the start of 
the Educational Intervention through the end of the study or resolution of the AE/SAE, whichever is  later.

 All non- serious AEs as per 7.1.1will be recorded on the Adverse Event form (Appendix 
11.3), and reported to the IRB as per IRB reporting requirements. 
 
7.2.6.  Serious Adverse Event Reporting 
 
The study investigator shall complete an SAE Form (Appendix 11.4) and s ubmit to the 
study sponsor and to the reviewing Institutional Review Board (IRB) as soon as possible, 
but in no event  later than 48 hours after the investigator  first learns  of the effect.  The study 
sponsor is responsible for conducting an evaluation of the SAE and shall report the results 
of such evaluation to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and to all reviewing IRBs within 10 working days after the sponsor first receives notice of the effect. Thereafter, the sponsor shall submit such additional reports concerning the effect as FDA  requests.  
 
 
8. STATISTICAL  CONSIDERATIONS  
8.1. Sample Size  Determination  
 
The primary  outcome will be measured  as number of CAUTIs  per 1000 catheter  days. Given this 
type of data, a Poisson regression model will be used to model CAUTI incidence, with the 
dichotomous predictor variable pertaining to the intervention serving as the critical test for the hypothesis. To determine how many catheter days would be needed to adequately power the 
study, a power analysis was conducted using G*Power 3.1.9.2, with the following parameters:  
 
• Baseline CAUTI Rate : 0.89/1000 catheter days (entered as .00089/day) 
o Baseline rate reflects CAUTI rate for NorthShore University Health System in  2016. 
• Hypothesized reduction in CAUTI : 50% 
• Alpha : 0.05 (one- tailed)  
• Power:  80% 
• Mean Exposure: 1 day (the actual exposure will vary by participant, but entering 1 day 
can be used t o determine number of catheter days rather than number of 
participants).  
• R
2 other X:  0% 
• X distribution : Binomial 
• X parm Π : 0.5 
 
The result from this analysis indicated that 83,426 catheter days would be needed to adequately power the study at 80%. NorthShore Hospital University System averages approximately 32,000 catheter days annually, which can be reduced to 2,667 per month. Thus, total number of catheter days required for collecting retrospective data and prospective data would be 85,344 catheter days. The 42,672 (85,344- catheter days/2) catheter days of prospective data in 
comparison to a similar number of catheter days of retr ospective data will provide data required 
for conducting the analysis.

8.2. Statistical  Analysis 
8.2.1.  Primary  Endpoint 
 
The primary endpoint will be the comparison of CAUTI rates during the intervention period 
compared to the retrospective control period. This will be tested by modeling the likelihood 
of developing a CAUTI as a function of intervention status using Poisson regression, with 
the number of catheter days serving as the offset. A significant value for the parameter representing  the interven tion will serve as the test for the impact  of the intervention. Formally, 
the hypothesis is:  
 
H
0: β1 ≥ 0 
H1: β1 < 0 
 
Where β 1 represents the beta- parameter for the dichotomous predictor variable pertaining to 
the intervention, with the retrospective control group coded as 0 and the prospective intervention group coded as 1. 
 
The 95% confidence interval for the incidence rate ratio will also be presented.  
 
Given that the retrospective and prospective portions of the study cover a significant period of catheter  days,  it is not expected  that the two groups will vary on demographic variables  or 
other key variables such as length -of-time the catheter is inserted, hospital unit during 
admission, etc. Thus, testing the incidence rate ratio will be sufficient for determining if a there is a significant difference in the CAUTI rate between the two time periods. 
 
In the event  of over-dispersion of the data,  negative  binomial regression  may be implemented 
to account  for the over- dispersed  data.  Missing  data on the primary  endpoint is not anticipated 
to be a concern, given that government reporting requirements dictate that CAUTI rates be reported, which only requires an analysis of catheter days and number of CAUTIs. Participants who are discharged with an IUC or w ho expire during their admission will have 
their catheter  days as well  as any infections that occurred  prior to discharge or death  counted 
in the analysis.  
 
8.2.2.  Secondary  Endpoint 
 
The secondary endpoint will be an analysis of bacteria in the urine, comparing a random sub-sample of the study sample during the intervention to a random sub- sample of 
participants  during the beginning of the Education Intervention. Samples  of urine from  the 
Education Intervention and those taken during the intervention will be compared in two ways. The number of individual bacterial species isolated from the cultures will be compared between the two groups, as well as cfu/ml of bacteria present, which will be quantified as follows:

 1. No bacterial growth 
2. 100-500 cfu/ml 
3. 500-10,000 cfu/ml 4. 10,000-50,000 cfu/ml 5. 50,000-100,000 cfu/ml 6. ≥100,000 cfu/ml  
 
Parametric or non -parametric measures, depending on the normality of the distribution, 
will be used to compare the two groups’ mean values on these two measures, with the 
hypothesis that use of ReadyCleanse
® may reduce the amount of bacteria in the urine, 
providing a mechanistic account of how it may reduce CAUTI. 
 
8.2.3.  Exploratory Endpoints 
 
8.2.3.1.  Healthcare Professional  Feedback  
 
The data analysis  for the healthcare professional feedback  survey  in Appendix 11.2 
will be descriptive in nature. Survey responses will be assigned a numeric value, 
with “strongly disagree” = 1, “disagree” = 2, and so on. Mean values for each response will be calculated, and sub- analyses will  be conducted stratifying the 
values by education, experience and age. These data will be collected approximately in Month 3 of the study. At the completion of the data collection, these data will be analyzed and may be presented externally. No other data from the study will be analyzed and no changes will be made to the study based on this feedback without a protocol amendment. As HCP feedback on the device in this setting  is independent of whether  the intervention reduces  CAUTI,  analyzing  these 
data does not create an issue of multiple comparisons for the primary endpoint and 
therefore does not require p- value adjustment.  
 
8.2.3.2.  Financial  Analysis  
 
In order to investigate any financial savings from the use of ReadyCleanse®, we 
will undertake a fi nancial analysis taking into account savings from avoided 
CAUTIs offset by the increased cost in using the ReadyCleanse® product and 
warmer as compared to soap -and-water. Government data on the estimated cost of 
a CAUTI will be used for these calculations.

 The intervention used in this study, ReadyCleanse® Meatal & Perineal Cleansing Cloth, is 
a currently  marketed  device with labeling  and indication  for use in meatal  and perineal  care 
as part of the standard catheter care and maintenance that occurs for all patients with 
urinary catheters. Consequently, this study entails minimal risk to the participant. Therefore, participant consent will not be obtained for this study. The addition of urine 
collection does not necessitate informed consent either, as the urine will be collected  from 
the Foley catheter bag, which otherwise would have been discarded. As described in Section 9.1.3, all measures for protecting participant privacy and confidentiality will be in 
place.  
 
9.1.2.  Study Discontinuation and Closeout 
 
9.1.2.1  Study Discontinuation 
 
This st udy may be temporarily suspended or prematurely terminated if there is 
sufficient reasonable cause. Written notification, documenting the reason for study 
suspension or termination, will be provided by the suspending or terminating party 
to the PI, sponsor, and IRB. If the study is prematurely terminated or suspended, the Principal  Investigator (PI) will promptly inform the Institutional Review  Board 
(IRB)  and sponsor and will provide the reason(s)  for the termination  or suspension. 
 
Circumstances that may warrant termination or suspension include, but are not limited to:  
 
• Determination of unexpected, significant, or unacceptable risk to participants as determined by Adverse Event review  
• Insufficient compliance to protocol requirements  
• Data that are not suff iciently complete and/or evaluable  
 
The study may resume once concerns about safety, protocol compliance, and data quality are addressed, and satisfy the sponsor and/or IRB. 
 
9.1.2.2  Study Closeout 
 
Upon completion of the study, Medline and/or its designees will notify the site of 
closeout related  procedures  and will coordinate with the site the return  of equipment 
and/or any unused ReadyCleanse® cloths. Medline CRA will communicate  closely 
with the Investigator at that time point and will review all close out steps and 
materials. All study data, related study documents, unused study product, and 
warmers will be returned to the Sponsor. Sponsor will provide the facility with a 
summary of the activities  and findings after the final analysis of the data has been 
completed. The site will also notify the IRB that the study has  completed.

 9.1.3.  Confidentiality and Privacy  
 
Participant confidentiality and privacy is strictly held in trust by the participating 
investigators, their staff, and the sponsor. This confidentiality is extended to cover testing of biological samples in addition to the clinical information relating to  participants. 
Therefore, the study protocol, documentation, data, and all othe r information generated 
will be held in strict confidence. No information concerning the study or the data will be released to any unauthorized third party without prior written approval of the sponsor. All study data and study records will be managed and stored in accordance with the site’s HIPAA  compliant policies  on data storage  and security.  All electronic transmission  of data 
will adhere to HIPAA Security  Rules.  
 
The study monitor, other authorized representatives of the sponsor, representatives of the Institutional Review Board (IRB), and regulatory agencies may inspect all documents and records  required  to be maintained  by the investigator, including but not limited  to, medical 
records (office, clinic, or hospital) and pharmacy records for the participants in this study. The clinical study site will permit access to such  records.  
 
A master list linking subject numbers to patient name and medical record number will be 
maintained in a secure electronic database by the staff at NorthShore University Health System. This database will be maintained at the site at all times. The Sponsor may need access to the master list linking subject numbers to patient name in the eve nt of an AE or 
other suitable event. Please note that this list will only contain information on the patients in the study who have indwelling urinary catheters; this does not refer to NorthShore employees participating in the healthcare worker survey desc ribed in Section 6.3.1.1.3. 
 
Participants of the healthcare worker survey will not be assigned a subject ID. They will be emailed a link to the survey provided in Section 11.2 and asked to participate; as indicated in Section 11.7, this email will convey that participation is strictly  voluntary and 
no repercussions will occur should they choose not to participate. The only information provided to the Sponsor regarding the NorthShore employees will be that which they provide in response to the survey in 11.2. All of this information is de-identified to ensure privacy and confidentiality. 
 
The study participant’s contact information will be securely stored at each clinical site for internal use during the study. At the end of the study, all records will continue to be kept in a secure loc ation  for at least a period of two years,  or longer  if dictated  by the reviewing 
IRB, Institutional policies, sponsor requirements, or ICH/GCP and FDA requirements. The PI will agree to notify sponsor of any intent to move or destroy these documents. 
 
Study participant research data, which is for purposes of statistical analysis and scientific 
reporting, will be maintained at the research sites. The research site will export summary files for statistical analysis to Medline Industries, Inc. These files will not include the

 participant’s contact or identifying information. Rather, individual participants and their 
research data will be identified by a unique study identification number. The demographic data available on each participant (age, gender, and general clinical measures) will be generic enough as to not reveal the participant’s identity. The study data entry and study management systems used by clinical sites and by Medline Industri es, Inc. research staff 
will be secured and stored in an access controlled locked drawer (any paper forms) and password protected (electronic records). At the end of the study, all study databases that are not already de -identified will be de -identified an d archived at the Medline Industries,

9.1.5.  Safety  Oversight 
 
Given that this is a post -market study on a device used in accordance with its labeling, 
there is minimal safety  risk to participants.  Consequently, the PI will review  AEs and SAEs 
regularly and make any necessary safety determinations as  needed.  
 
9.1.6.  Clinical Monitoring 
 
The CRA will confirm that the rights and well- being of subjects are protected, the 
reported trial data are accurate, complete, and verifiable from source documents, and will confirm the conduct of the trial by the Investigator and site is in compliance with the protocol, GCP, and regulatory requirements as well as any applicable institution or IRB and federal  or local  processes.  Monitoring will occur  at minimum every  two months 
during the study duration or more frequently if: 
 
• The volume or quality of data is large or there is a backlog of review due to unexpected  issues 
o This would also include any large volume of CRFs to be reviewed 
• The site compliance with the protocol or compliance with expected ICH/GCP and regulatory requirements is lacking or there are continuing unresolved compliance issues  
• There are unexpected AE/SAE or subject safety concerns  noted 
• There are any unexpected inco nsistencies with study product management

 • There is a request for more frequent monitoring by the site 
• Any mutually agreeable situation as determined by NorthShore and Medline  
 
The frequency of routine monitoring may be increased  to a longer interval  after three 
monitoring cycles if on- site situations support this change. CRA will discuss this 
with Medline Associate Director or Clinical Manager and will inform the PI prior  to 
implementation.  
 
Monitoring activities will include subject eligibility, source data review, CRF 
completion verification, product accountability, site continued suitability, PI study oversight, compliance,  etc. and all general  monitoring activities  as outlined in FDAs 
Code of Federal Regulations and ICH/GCP guidelines that guide that activity.  
 
Medline may, on occasion, contract with external CROs to provide CRA services and those CRAs are authorized to act on behalf of Medline. 
 
It is expected that the site will be compliant with any institutional SOPs during the execution of the protocol and evidence of that compliance should be readily documented and verifiable by the CRA.  
 
The CRA will generate an internal Medline visit report that will be filed with the Medline trial master  file and will provide the PI a detailed  follow-up letter  after each 
monitoring visit that will outline the completed monitoring activities as well as any identified areas of concern and the expected/applicable corrections needed.  Medline 
reserves  the right  to perform  audit of the study activities  – either  routine or for- cause  
– as needed and may also perform clinical monitoring audit as well.  
 
9.1.7.  Data handling and Record Keeping  
 
9.1.7.1  Data Collection and Management  Responsibilities  
 
Data collection is the responsibility of the clinical trial staff at the site under the supervision of the site investigator. The investigator is responsible for ensuring the 
accuracy, completeness, legibility, and timeliness of the data reported. 
 
All source documents of any kind (electronic, paper, etc.) should be completed in accordance with Good Documentation Practices (GDP) to ensure accurate interpretation of data. CRFs will be created for each subject for the prospective portion of the study. CRFs will be generated retrospectively only for patients that developed a CAUTI.  The CRF  for each subject will be populated from  the subject’s 
EHR. The CRA will verify the data entered into the CRF with the site source regardless of the type of source. The site will be responsible for developing a written process that ensures the CRA is able view the source data.

 Data from the CRFs will be entered by NorthShore study staff into a Microsoft 
Excel spreadsheet for statistical analysis. Data in the Excel database will be transferred to and analyzed with SAS, which allows for internal quality checks, such as automatic range checks, to identify data that appear inconsistent, incomplete, or inaccurate. Medline Industries, Inc. will be responsible for overseeing final data analysis and confirmation of results.  
 
9.1.7.2  Study Records Retention  
 
Study documents should be retained until at least two years have elapsed since the formal discontinuation of the study intervention or as required by any applicable FDA guidelines or for a longer period if required by local regulations. No records will be destroyed without the written consent of the sponsor, if applicable. It is the responsibility of the sponsor to inform the investigator when these documents no longer need to be retained. The Investigator is required to notify Medline if the location of the stored documents is changed after it is defined at the time of the Close Out Visit at study  end. 
 
9.1.8.  Protocol Deviations 
 
A protocol deviation is any noncompliance with the clinical trial protocol, International Conference on Harmonization Good Clinical Pra ctice (ICH GCP), or Manual of 
Procedures (MOP) requirements. The noncompliance may be either on the part of the participant, the investigator, or the study site staff. As a result of deviations, corrective actions are to be developed by the site and implemented promptly. These practices are consistent with ICH GCP: 
 
4.5 Compliance with Protocol, sections 4.5.1, 4.5.2, and 4.5.3 5.1 Quality Assurance and Quality Control, section 5.1.1 5.20 Noncompliance, sections 5.20.1, and 5.20.2. 
 
It is the responsibility  of the site investigator to use continuous vigilance to identify and 
report deviations on a routine basis. All deviations must be addressed in study source documents, and reported  to Medline Industries, Inc. Protocol deviations must be sent to the 
reviewi ng Institutional Review Board (IRB) per their policies. The site investigator is 
responsible for knowing and adhering to the reviewing IRB requirements. A copy of the IRB reporting process for protocol deviations will be provided to the CRA by the site and will be filed with the site research materials related to the  study.

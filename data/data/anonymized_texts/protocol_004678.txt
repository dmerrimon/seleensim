 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
2.1. Current imaging of prostate cancer  
Prostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer and second leading cause of 
cancer death in American men .1 Existing conventional imaging (CT, MRI and bone 
scans) has a low sensitivity in detecting local recurrence or metastatic disease.2 The 
one exception is NaF PET/CT for the detection of osseous metastasis. Due to this 
limitation, numerous approaches to stage patients have been evaluated.  
C-11 and F -18 Choline PET imaging have been frequently used, as prostate cancer 
exhibits increased  choline uptake that has been associated with increased cell 
membrane proliferation and increased levels of choline kinase .3 Choline uptake is 
increased in comparison to FDG in both androgen dependent and independent prost ate cancer patients .
4 Choline ha s also been shown to be sensitive for the 
detection of recurrent tumor , although sensitivity is somewhat lower  in patients with 
PSA (prostate specific antigen) values of less than 1.0 ng/ml .5 There are two forms of 
choline that are used in imaging prostate  cancer, C -11 and F -18 choline. C-11 choline 
has a short half -life of 20 minutes, which limits its detection for metastatic disease but 
results in improved local detection due to decreased urinary activity at the time of imaging. F-18 choline has significa nt urinary excretion that limits evaluation of the 
prostate but, but has been shown to have better detection rates for distant metastatic 
disease.
6 C-11 choline has limited sensitivity for osseous metastasis, possibly due to 
page 8 of 35 the decreased uptake time.7 Additionally, the sensitivity of C -11 choline is limited in 
patients with PS A values < 1.0 ng/ml .8-10 Although choline PET may be limited in 
sensitivity, it clearly shows more  lesions than cross section imaging or bone scan in 
patients with known disease .11  In 2012, the Mayo Clinic obtained a new drug 
application approval from the FDA for the use of C -11 choline.  
A separate approach is to image prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA).  PSMA 
is expressed on the majority of prostate cancer cells, and so is  an ideal target  to 
image.  The initial imaging approach to target PSMA was done  using Indium -111-
capromab (Prostascint), a murine monoclonal antibody.12,13 Although there was early 
promise for the detection of nodal metastasis ,14 the agent does not  adequately 
visualize osseous metastasis15 and has limited sensitivity, a lthough combination with 
SPECT/CT does improve lesion detection.16 One main limitation to In -111-capromab 
is tha t it takes a prolonged time to localize to the target tissue, which relates to both 
the size of the monoclonal antibody and its slow pharmacokinetics . Additionally, 
Prostascint also recognizes an intracellular epitope, so the antibody must cross the 
membra ne to be effective. This likely only occurs in permeable dead or dying tumor 
cells.  
Because of the limitations of In -111 capromab, there have been continued effort s to 
develop agents that target the extracellular domain of the PSMA protein. The Ga -68 
labeled PSMA -HBED- CC compound has become of particular interest due to two 
important publications . The first study demonstrate d that PSMA -HBED- CC has a 
higher sensitivity for the detection of disease than F -18 choline in a head- to-head 
intra-patient comparison that included 37 patients .17 The second paper looked at the 
sensitivity of PSMA -HBED- CC in detect ing metastatic lesions in patients with 
recurrent prostate cancer .18 Their results demonstrated a detection rate of 50% for 
patients with a PSA less than 1 ng/ml, and detection rate above 85% for patients with 
a PSA greater than 2 ng/ml.  These detection rates are signif icantly higher than that 
reported by groups using choline.5 
2.2. 68Ga PSMA -HBED -CC (68Ga PSMA -11) 
Current evidence regarding detection rate of  biochemical recurrence (BCR)  with 
68Ga-HBED- CC PSMA PET/CT  from two recent papers : 
• Detection rate was 50% when PSA was below 0.5 ng/mL, 69% for PSA 0.5–2.0 ng/mL, and 86% when PSA was above 2.0.19  
• Detection rate was 57.9% for PSA 0.2 to <0.5 ng/mL, 72.7% for PSA 0.5 to <1, 93.0% for 1 to <2.0, and 96.8% for ≥ 2.0.20  
2.3. Prior human subjects experience  
Safety . No adverse drug reactions have been  reported in the literature for 68Ga 
PSMA -HBED- CC. As a PET tracer, the drug should remain pharmacologically inert 
and not perturb the biological system. Afshar -Oromieh and colleagues17,18 as well as 
Green et al.21 have cl early stated that no adverse events or pharmacologic events were 
observed during their studies. Adverse events were not discussed in other reviewed 
studies20,22 -28 or case reports.29,30 In total, these papers provide data regarding more 
than 1200 subjects without any noted adverse reactions.  
page 9 of 35 Efficacy. To date, there  have been 11 studies17,18,20,23,24,26,27,38 -41 describing use of 
68Ga PSMA -HBED- CC and 4 clinical trials.21,25,28 Tables with key information of 
reviewed pap ers are provided (Tables 6- 1, 6-2, and 6-3) in the body of the IND 
application. 
Maurer et al.  (2014) [Germany].23 The purpose of this retrospective study was 
to investigate th e diagnostic efficacy of 68Ga PSMA -HBED- CC -PET imaging 
when compared against radical prostatectomy , templated lymph node 
dissection , and conventional imaging (CT, MRI). The primary inclusion 
criterion was  intermediate -to-high risk prostate cancer schedule d to undergo 
radical prostatectomy. The only exclusion criterion  was presence, or history, of 
a secondary malignancy. A total of 130 patients were reviewed. A contrast 
enhanced diagnostic CT was performed at the same imaging session as the PET 
scan. A double -trained board certified radiologist -nuclear medicine physician 
blinded to post -operative histopathological results analyzed all the imaging data 
sets (68Ga PSMA -PET/CT and PET/MR). Conventional imaging was read prior 
to the 68Ga PSMA -PET data. Results y ielded a patient -based ROC AUC of 
0.835 (95% CI 0.763 – 0.908) for 68Ga PSMA -PET and an AUC of 0.691 (95% 
CI 0.592 -0.789) for conventional imaging. For 68Ga PSMA -PET patient -based 
sensitivity was 65.9 %, specificity was 98.9%, and overall accuracy of 88.5%. 
In contrast, conventional imaging had a patient -based sensitivity of 43.9%, 
specificity of 85.4%, and an overall accuracy of 72.3%. On a template -based 
analysis driven by lymph node dissection, the 68Ga PSMA -PET sensitivity was 
calculated as 78.2%, specificity as 99.1%, and accuracy as 95.7%. Conventional 
imaging resulted in a sensitivity of 29.1%, specificity of 97.2%, and accuracy of 86.1%.  
Van Leeuwen et al.  (2014) [Australia].25 The purpose of this prospective trial 
was to assess accuracy of 68Ga PSMA -HBED- CC -PET/CT for lymph node 
staging in intermediate - and high -risk prostate cancer. Criteria for selection 
included planned radical prostatectomy, trea tment naïve, negative bone scan, no 
concurrent (or history of) a secondary malignancy, and at >5% risk of metastatic lymph nodes. Patients with suspected extra -nodal disease on prior 
contrast -enhanced CT were excluded. 
68Ga PSMA -HBED- CC PET/CT was 
performe d <4 weeks before the radical prostatectomy and lymph node 
dissection. A total of 30 men were enrolled and evaluated. A non- contrast 
enhanced CT was performed at the same imaging session of the 68Ga PSMA -
HBED- CC -PET. Images were analyzed by two nuclear medicine physicians; it 
is not stated if the physicians were blinded to the pathologic results or if the 
scan interpretations were completed prior to surgery. Results yielded a patient -
based specificity of 95%, sensitivity of 64%, positive predictive value o f 88%, 
and negative predictive value of 82%. Lymph node analysis yielded specificity of 100%, sensitivity of 58%, PPV of 94% and NPV of 98%. The mean size of 
true-positive metastatic lymph nodes was 4.7 mm (± 1.4mm) and false -negative 
size was 2.7mm (± 1.3mm).  
Eiber et al.  (2015)  [Germany].20 The purpose of this retrospective study was to 
investigate the detection rate of 68Ga PSMA -HBED- CC PET/CT in men with 
page 10 of 35 biochemical recurrence (PSA ≥ 0.2 ng/mL). Only men who had undergone a 
radical prostatectomy, had not received chemotherapy, and had a diagnostic CT 
done with the PSMA imaging study were included. Men undergoing 
antiandrogen therapy (n=70) were included. A total of 248 subjects were 
included in the analysis. The active comparato r was the diagnostic CT done 
simultaneously with the PET imaging. Scans were interpreted by a board 
certified radiologist and a board certified nuclear medicine physician. The 
reviewers were not blinded. No significant detection effect was observed with 
antiandrogen use (p=0.0783). PSMA was able to identify additional areas of 
disease involvement in 61 subjects (24.6%) whereas CT showed additional regions in 17 subjects (6.9%). A significant limitation of the study was a lack of 
histopathology for outcome c omparisons. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and 
negative predictive values are not provided.  
Afshar -Oromieh et al.  (2015)  [Germany].18 The purpose of this retrospective 
study was to analyze the diagnostic value of 68Ga PSMA -HBED -CC PET/CT in 
a large cohort with multiple variables. The cohort was designed to align with a generalized population; men were included if they had suspected progressive 
disease following conventional therapy (radiation therapy and/or radical prostatectomy, n=292) or to determine metastatic disease burden prior to initial 
therapy (n=27). Of those with suspected recurrence, 86 were on antiandrogen 
therapy. A non- contrast enhanced diagnostic CT scan was performed at the 
same imaging session as the PET scan; additionally, a low -dose attenuation 
scan was performed for the 
68Ga PSMA -HBED -CC PET. Scans were 
interpreted by two board- certified nuclear medicine physicians. N o adverse 
events or clinically detectable pharmacological effects were noted in any of the 
subjects following injection of the PSMA -HBED- CC radiotracer. A total of 901 
tumor lesions were observed in 319 subjects. Lesion- based analysis yielded 
sensitivity o f 76.6%, specificity of 100%, negative predictive value of 91.4%, 
and positive predictive value of 100%. Because all patients were assumed to 
have tumor and therefore could not be considered ‘true negative,’ the authors did not provide a per -patient calcul ation.  
Green et al.  (2017)  [Indiana University School of Medicine, Indiana, US]. The 
purpose of this small study was to estimate human radiation dosimetry for 68Ga 
PSMA -HBED -CC under approval of an RDRC research protocol. Both 
biodistribution and pharmacokinetics were evaluated in subjects (n = 9). Administered dose of 
68Ga PSMA -HBED- CC was 3.04 mCi and images were 
acquired at 15 minutes post -injection, 60 minutes  post -injection, and 90 minutes 
post-injection. Subjects reported no symptoms or adverse reactions following 
radiopharmaceutical administration. Organ dose estimates were provided for 22 
organs and for whole body. 
It should be noted that radiolabeled PSMA ligands have been shown to be taken up by rectal carcinoma,
31 gastrointestinal stromal tumors,32 renal cell carcinoma,33 
pancreatic serous cystadenoma,34 stromal hyperplasia of the breast,35 B-cell follicular 
non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma,36 and Paget disease.37 
page 11 of 35 Summary. To date, a prospective, well -controlled clinical trial evaluating the 
efficacy of 68Ga PSMA -HBED- CC PET/CT has not been performed for prostate 
cancer. Robust trials for both initial diagnosis as well as those men with suspected 
recurrence needs to be designed and performed. Current retrospective review of 68Ga 
PSMA -HBED- CC PET/CT done in foreign nations suggests strong effi cacy of the 
68Ga PSMA -HBED- CC radiotracer. Currently, three clinical trials are underway –  
two foreign, one domestic.42-44 Additional pivotal phase 3 trials should be completed 
in the U.S. to determine effectiveness in the generalized population and determine requirements for implementation if found to  be effective.  
2.4. Rationale  
Imaging and staging of prostate cancer is critical for surgical and treatment planning. We aim to image patients with suspected metastatic prostate cancer using Gallium -68 
labeled HBED -CC PSMA (
68Ga PSMA -HBED- CC) in order to determ ine its utility.  
We plan to utilize this data to obtain further approvals of the 68Ga PSMA -HBED- CC 
compound, so that this agent will become widely available for clinical imaging in 
prostate cancer patients.   
68Ga PSMA -HBED- CC has been shown to be superior to choline based Carbon- 11 
and Fluorine -18 PET imaging agents for the staging of prostate cancer . However,  
68Ga PSMA -HBED- CC was not patented and therefore no company or private entity 
will make the investment required to bring it to market.  In the vacuum of availability, 
academic groups are taking the lead in order to collect the necessary data for future 
FDA approval.  
The rate of prostatectomy is increasing in high- risk prostate cancer patients (1), which 
means  that there is an increasing unmet need to detect regional and distant metastases 
prior to surgery. Two published studies to date using 68Ga PSMA -HBED- CC PET in 
intermediate to high -risk patients prior to prostatectomy, demonstrat ed a per patient 
sensitivity for nodal metastases of 64- 66% (2,3), much improved compared to 
conventional imaging modalities. We aim to study the ability of 68Ga PSMA -HBED-
CC to detect pelvic nodal disease in intermediate and high -risk preprostatectomy 
patients .

5.4.6. Results dissemination.  Results will be shared with the subject’s urol ogist 
and will be included in the subject’s medical record.  
5.5. Visual I nterpretation of PET data  (Internal blinded reads ) 
Regions of suspected disease will be graded on a two -point scale by each reader 
(0=Negative or 1=Positive). A region will be judged as positive if at least one lesion 
in this region is visually positive. Regions are defined in Table 12.1. in Section 12.  
Criteria for visual interpretation positive for disease are detailed  in Section 1 2. 1.1. 
5.5.1. Lymph nodes . Considered positive if 68Ga PSMA -HBED- CC uptake is 
focal and greater than adjacent background. Pelvic lymph nodes will be 
subclassified  according to their localization as follows: R/L obturator, R/L 
page 14 of 35 external iliac, R/L internal iliac , and other  pelvic nodes  (total of 7 
subgroups). 
5.5.2. Visceral lesions . Considered positive if the 68Ga PSMA -HBED- CC uptake 
is focal and greater than physiologic background activity of the involvement 
organ or anatomic site.  
5.5.3. Bone lesions . Considered positive if the 68Ga PSMA -HBED- CC uptake is 
focal and greater than physiologic bone marrow.  
5.6. Post-Imaging Prostatectomy  
Prostatectomy and pelvic nodal dissection will be  performed  at the discretion of 
referring physican after reviewing imaging results. Nodal dissection should follow 
standard of care.  
5.6.1. Negative imaging. Subjects  without evidence of positive nodal or 
metastatic disease on 68Ga PSMA -HBED- CC PET imaging will u ndergo 
radical prostatectomy and pelvic nodal dissection . The pelvic nodal 
dissection will be performed regardless of imaging results. 
5.6.2. Positive imaging. The urologist will be informed of the location of any 68Ga 
PSMA -HBED- CC PET positive  (or suspicious)  regional pelvic node s prior 
to surgery. The surgeon should attempt to capture the suspicious node 
during the nodal dissection. 
5.6.3. Nodal dissection. Nodes will be marked by location using the standard 
procedures. For example, if the urologist removed left and ri ght nodal 
regions separately, the subject will have two nodal regions (left/right). If the 
nodes are removed  in six groups (bilateral internal/external/obturator nodes), 
the subject will have six nodal regions analyzed.  
5.6.4. Pathology: Specimens from prostatectomy will be evaluated for the 
presence of nodal metastasis.  This will be reported on a per patient basis , 
and by region as positive or negative. The pathology report should list the 
number of nodes counted during the exam.  
5.6.5. Immunohistochemical staining  (IHC) (optional).  Although not routinely 
performed during standard practice, IHC staining for PSMA of tumor specimens (primary and lymph node metastases) is preferred.  
5.7. Post-Prostatectomy Procedures  
5.7.1. PSMA -positive with negative pathology. Subjects  with 68Ga PSMA -
HBED- CC positive nodes without positive nodes on pathology, may be 
rescanned with CT (or MRI) to determin e if the suspicious node was 
thought to be removed.  Additionally, clinicans will have the option to order 
a 2nd 68Ga PSMA -HBED -CC PET/CT as described in Section 6.4.4. 
5.7.2. PSMA -positive osseous or metastatic lesions.  68Ga PSMA -HBED- CC 
positive osseous or distant metastatic lesions will be followed by other 
imaging (bone scan, NaF PET, CT or MRI) at the treating physician’s discretion and local standard of care.  
5.7.3. Biopsy. Biopsies to determine metastas es or provide information for re -
staging shoul d be performed at treating physician’s discretion and per local 
page 15 of 35 standard of care.  
5.7.4. CT or MRI.  Subjects should undergo routine standard of care imaging.  
5.7.5. Positive disease identified by either 68Ga PSMA -HBED- CC PET/CT or 
follow -up conventional imaging will tri gger locally performed anatomic 
measurement of lesion size(s) on both the baseline CT or MRI, and the 
follow -up CT or MRI of suspected site of disease.  
5.8. General Concomitant Medication and Supportive Care Guidelines  
In general, subjects may receive full concomitant and supportive care throughout this 
trial with the following considerations: 
• Subjects may not receive any other approved or investigational anti -neoplastic 
therapies for the treatment of prostate cancer from time of consent through 
prostatectomy.  
5.9. Follow -Up  
5.9.1. Active follow -up. Subjects will be actively followed for acute adverse 
events for 10 radioactive half -lives rounded up to the calendar day ( as per 
the established standard ). Since Gallium- 68 has a half -life of 67.71 minute s 
the active follow -up will be a minimum of 1 calendar day.  
5.9.2. Long term follow -up. After the active follow -up period, the subject will 
return to standard follow -up with their physician. Subject’s outcome should 
be followed through passive chart review. Data collected must minimally  
include subsequent PSA measurements, and any evidence of disease 
progression. Contact with  subject and/or subject’s treating physicians may 
occur to better define treatment outcomes. 
5.10. Criteria for removal from study  
• Consent . Subjects must be able to continue to provide consent for this study. If a 
treating physician or study team member believes a subject can no longer provide 
prospective consent, the investigator will be contacted to determine if the subject 
can provide consent and is able to continue on study. 
• Refusal to continue treatment . In this event, the reasons for withdrawal will be 
documented.  
 PATIENT ASSESSMENTS  
6.1. Post-consent Baseline Data Collection  
Post-consent, the following data should be collected 
6.1.1. Pathology. A copy of the pathology report documenting the Gleason score 
should be obtained.  Also, obtain a copy of any pathology reports 3 months 
prior to the 68Ga PSMA -HBED- CC PET/CT . 
6.1.2. Bone scan.  If a bone scan was performed within 3 months  of 68Ga PSMA -
HBED- CC PET/ CT, obtain a copy of the images and the report.  
6.1.3. MRI . If an MRI was performed within 3 months  of 68Ga PSMA -HBED- CC 
PET/CT, obtain a copy of the images and the report. 
6.1.4. CT scan . If a CT was performed within 3 months  of 68Ga PSMA -HBED- CC 
page 16 of 35 PET/CT, obtain a copy of the images and the report.

PET/CT should be obtained.  
6.2. Pre-Imaging Assessments (Baselines)  
6.2.1. Constitutional adverse events. A baseline evaluation  will be obtained  prior 
to injection and  graded according to NCI’s Common Toxicity Criteria 
(CTCAE v4) . 
6.2.2. Vital signs . Heart rate, blood pressure, and temperature will be obtained 
immediately before and after injection of 68Ga PSMA -HBED- CC, in a 
supine position.   
6.3. Post-Imagi ng Assessments 
6.3.1. Vital signs . Heart rate, blood pressure, and temperature will be obtained 
when subject is supine immediately after the  imaging session. 
6.3.2. Constitutional adverse events.  Prior to discharge from the PET Imaging 
Center  the subject will be assesse d for untoward medical event(s) that have 
occur red since injection of 68Ga PSMA -HBED- CC.  These will be graded 
with CTCAE.  
6.3.3. Symptom review . Subject will be contacted by telephone or in person 
between 1 to 3 business days after PSMA -HBED -CC imaging to screen for 
adverse events. Subject must be contacted at least once after 24  hours  post-
injection.  
6.4. Follow -up 
6.4.1. Pathology. Results from pathology ordered per standard of care up to 12 
months post 68Ga PSMA -HBED- CC PET/CT,  will be  obtained  for study 
analysis.    
6.4.2. Follow -up imaging . Conventional imaging ordered per standard of care up 
to 12 months post 68Ga PSMA -HBED- CC PET/CT,  will be  obtained  for 
study analysis.  If the 1st Ga-68 PSMA -HBED -CC PET/CT scan shows 
lesions outside the pelvic region AND i f imaging is N OT obtained per 
standard of care the research study will obtain a CT (abdomen and pelvis w/ 
contrast if contrast not contraindicated).  Readers will be unblinded to all 
results and will be specifically informed of the location of the 68Ga PSMA -
HBED- CC PET positive lesions so follow -up measurements may be 
performed on the same lesions. 
6.4.3. Laboratory. Results from laboratory reports related to prostate cancer 
monitoring (e.g. PSA levels) ordered per standard of care up to 12 months 
post 68Ga PSMA -HBED- CC PET/CT,  will be  obtained  for study analysis.  
6.4.4. Second 68Ga PSMA -HBED -CC PET/CT (if medically indicated) . If the 
1st 68Ga PSMA -HBED- CC PET/CT scan shows lymph nodes  or visceral 
(soft tissue) lesions  positive for prostate cancer disease, but surgery or 
biopsy results in negative pathology; the subject  may be asked to return  to 
complete  a 2nd Ga-68 PSMA -HBED- CC PET/CT imaging visit.

 ADVERSE EVENTS: REPORTING REQUIREMENTS  
This study will also be monitored by internal oversight specialists at the University of Iowa. 
The Data and Safety Monitoring Plan of the Holden Comprehensive Cancer Center provides standard operating procedures to monitor all clinical cancer trials at the  UIHC. All 
investigator -initiated trials are automatically monitored by the Data and Safety Monitoring 
Committee (DSMC). A detailed data and safety monitoring plan for this study is on file with the DSMC . This study has been assigned as a risk level 4 as a n IND phase 2b/3 study. 
9.1. Determination of Reporting Requirements  
The clinical research team is responsible for collecting and recording the research data. As these results are collected, all toxicities and adverse events will be identified 
and reported to t he principal investigator (PI). The PI will determine final relationship 
of the event to the investigational products (
68Ga PSMA -HBED- CC):  
• Grade 1 and 2 events do not require attributions assigned. 
• Grade 3 and higher adverse events require attribution assigned to 68Ga PSMA -
HBED- CC. 
• All serious adverse events (SAEs) require attribution to 68Ga PSMA -HBED- CC.  
Toxicity will be graded according to NCI’s Common Toxicity Criteria (CTCAE v4). 
The principal investigator will have final responsibility for dete rmining the attribution 
of toxicity as it is related to the investigational product.  
9.2. Institutional Review Board reporting requirements  
Adverse events that meet criteria of both serious and attributed  (possible, probable, or 
definite) to the study agent. Thus:  
• Serious adverse events only  
• Attributable to 68Ga PSMA -HBED- CC 
Report to the IRB via HawkIRB within 10 business days of event  
page 18 of 35 9.3. FDA reporting requirements [ M. Graham , sponsor]  
Adverse events that meet criteria of serious, unexpected, and attributed  (possible, 
probable, or definite) to 68Ga PSMA -HBED- CC must be reported to the sponsor or 
the sponsor’s appointed designee:  
• Serious adverse events only [21 CFR 312.32]  
• Attributable to 68Ga PSMA -HBED- CCwith a causal r elationship as described [21 
CFR 312.32 (c)(1)(i)]  
• Unexpected, as defined by the FDA: “…not listed in the investigator brochure or 
is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed; or, if an 
investigator or, if an investigator brochure  is not required or available, is not 
consistent with the risk information described in the general investigational plan 
or elsewhere in the current application, as amended.”  
9.4. Routine Adverse Event Reporting Requirements to DSMC  
For non- serious adverse even ts, documentation must begin at radiotracer injection  
and continue through 24 hours post injection.  
Routine adverse events will be reported by submission of an adverse events log to the 
DSMC at the time of DSMC review.  
9.5. Serious  Adverse Event Reporting to DSMC  
Serious adverse events occurring after 68Ga PSMA -HBED- CC injection  will require a 
notification to the DSMC within 1 busines s day of learning of the event. The SAE 
capture window will be from the administration of 68Ga PSMA -HBED- CC through 
24 hours aft er administration . Serious adverse events that occur after this window are 
reportable if they are deemed reasonably attributed to the investigational drug, 68Ga 
PSMA -HBED- CC . 
 CLINICAL TRIAL  MONITORING  
Clinical trial monitoring will be conducted to ensure that the rights and well -being of human 
subjects are protected, that the reported trial data are accurate, complete, and verifiable, and that the conduct of the trial is in compliance with the currently approved protocol and/or 
amendment, with good clinical practice (GCP), and with applicable regulatory 
requirement(s).

 EFFICACY ASSESSMENTS  
Determination of efficacy requires two primary assessments.  
The first assessment is the clinical read of the 68Ga-PSMA -HBED- CC PET/CT scan. Trained 
readers will identify lesions positive for prostate cancer disease, and based on these results, 
will categorize specifically defined anatomical regions of the subject (Table 1 2.2) as positive 
for disease by 68Ga-PSMA -HBED- CC PET/CT. Crite ria are described in Section 1 2.1 below. 
The second assessment is the reference standard determination of disease positivity or negativity also performed on the same specifically defined anatomical regions (Table 1 2.2).  
The reference standard definitions are described below, and consist of a combination of pathological confirmation, conventional imaging follow -up evidence, and serial PSA 
measurements. Criteria are described in Section 1 2.2 below. 
For purposes of endpoints, four major regions are identified for final analysis as defined in 
Table 1 2.1. Each region is divided into subregions as defined in Table 12.2. All primary data 
from 
68Ga-PSMA -HBED -CC PET interpretations, pathology results, and conventional 
imaging results, will be collected per the subre gions defined below. The final region 
assignments and results will be derived from the subregion data as applicable.

page 22 of 35 12.1. 68Ga-PSMA -HBED -CC PET  Results Definition  
Imaging interpretation 68Ga-PSMA -HBED- CC PET:  
Local Interpretations:   PET images will initially be interpreted by a board certified 
nuclear medicine physician or a board- certified radiologist experienced in reading 
PET at the time of the imaging study at the institution that the study is being 
performed. These interpretati ons will not be used for evaluation of the primary 
endpoint.  
Blinded  Read Logistics:  Imaging data will be de -identified. PET data will be 
interpreted by two  different readers in a random order at separate reading sessions. 
Cross sectional imaging (CT or M RI) from the 68Ga-PSMA -HBED- CC PET will be 
available for anatomic correlate. The blinded readers will be blinded to all other 
imaging results and all other clinical data.  
Reader Positivity and Negativity Definition:  Sub- regions defined in Table 1 2.2 will 
be graded for the presence of suspected disease on a two -point scale by each reader 
(0=Negative or 1=Positive). A region will be judged as positive if at least one lesion 
in this region is visually positive.. 
12.1.1. Criteria for visual interpretation:  
Sub-regions  of suspected disease will be graded on a two -point scale by each 
blinded reader (0=Negative or 1=  Positive). A region will be judged as positive 
if at least one lesion in this region is visually positive.  
 Lymph nodes will be considered positive if the 68Ga-PSMA -
HBED- CC uptake is focal and greater than blood pool (adjacent 
or mediastinal blood pool).  
- Lymph nodes will be classified further by region: pelvic, 
retroperitoneal, thoracic and other.  Additionally, pelvic lymph 
nodes will be sub- classified accord ing to their localization as 
follows: R/L obturator, R/L external iliac, R/L internal iliac and other (total of 7 subgroups).  These pelvic sub-regions will 
be correlated with reference standard results in these sub -
regions, however this sub- region data wi ll not be directly used 
for evaluation of the primary or secondary endpoints, but for exploratory analysis. 
 Visceral lesions will be considered positive if the 68Ga-PSMA -
HBED- CC uptake is focal and greater than physiologic 
background activity of the involvement organ or anatomic site. 
- Visceral lesions will be classified further by major organ: lung, 
liver, pancreas... as defined in Table 2 .  These sub -regions will 
be correlated with reference standard results in these sub -
regions, however this sub- region da ta will not be directly used 
for evaluation of the primary or secondary endpoints, but for 
exploratory analysis. 
 Bone lesions will be considered positive if the 68Ga-PSMA -
page 23 of 35 HBED- CC uptake is focal and greater than physiologic bone 
marrow.  
- Bone lesions will be classified by further by region: spine, ribs, 
pelvis, extremities, skull, sternum, and clavicle , as Defined in 
Table 1 2.2.  These sub- regions will be correlated with 
reference standard results in these sub- regions, however this 
sub-region data will  not be directly used for evaluation of the 
primary or secondary endpoint s, but for exploratory analysis .  
 Prostate bed and prostate lesions will be considered positive if 
the 68Ga-PSMA -HBED- CC uptake is focal and greater than 
physiologic background activity of the involvement organ or anatomic site.  
12.2. Reference standard definition:  
12.2.1. Histopathology/Biopsy will be the primary determinate of tissue positivity and negativity for prostate cancer diseas e. Pathology date, organ, and 
location as well as any notes related to the pathology will be obtained from the subject  chart.  The anatomical r egion/sub- region the pathology occurred 
in will be assigned by the investigator team : 
68Ga-PSMA -HBED- CC positive findings are aimed to be confirmed by 
histopathology/biopsy if clinically feasible.  Pathology performed 60 days before or after the 
68Ga-PSMA -HBED- CC PET will be available for 
correlation.  
Histopathological procedures and biopsies will be performed as cli nically 
indicated and as per institutional protocol. 
 Lymph Nodes, Visceral Lesions, and Bone Lesions positive for disease by pathology.  
− Lesions with positive pathologic confirmation will be regarded as positive for disease. The regionality of the resected tissue will be assigned into respective regions and sub- regions as described above in 
Table 1 2.2. 
 Lymph Nodes and Visceral Lesions negative for disease by pathology. 
− Tissue removed and negative for pathology are considered negative for prostate cancer disease, unless subsequent conventional imaging or 
68Ga-PSMA -HBED- CC PET imaging demonstrates that targeted tissue 
were not resected. In this case:  
i. Subjects can be rescanned with dedicated CT, MRI, or 68Ga-
PSMA -HBED- CC PET/CT to determine if the suspicious 68Ga-
PSMA -HBED- CC tissue was removed. If the tissue is 
confirmed as removed, this is considered negative for disease.  
page 24 of 35 ii. If 68Ga-PSMA -HBED- CC PET/CT positive tissue is still 
present, a needle biopsy can be pursued at the discretion of the 
treating physician. Ima ges of the procedure will be reviewed to 
determine if the correct tissue was biopsied.  
- If the 68Ga-PSMA -HBED- CC PET/CT positive tissue was 
biopsied, a negative pathologic finding of the biopsied 
tissue is considered negative for disease.  
- If the 68Ga-PSMA -HBED -CC PET/CT positive tissue was 
biopsied, a positive pathologic finding of the biopsied 
tissue is considered positive for disease.  
- If biopsy or re -biopsy is not performed, or the wrong tissue 
was biopsied, change in node size as measured by conventional imaging and as defined below will be the criteria by which disease status will be defined.  
 Bone lesions:  Given the high rate of false negative biopsies for osseous metastases in subject s with prostate cancer, subject s with 
negative bone biopsies of 
68Ga-PSMA -HBED- CC PET positive 
lesions will be further evaluated:  
- If pathology demonstrates an alternative diagnoses that is known to be 
68Ga-PSMA -HBED- CC positive (eg Renal Cell 
Carcinoma metastases, Paget’s disease), then this will be considered negative f or disease.  
- If pathology is indeterminate, then follow -up imaging as 
described below will be performed as per clinical standards at the site.  
 Although not routinely performed during standard practice, immunohistochemical staining for PSMA of tumor specimen s 
(primary and lymph node metastases) may be performed, although not required.  
 All regions not sampled for biopsy/histopathology will be designated as indeterminate for disease by pathology. Conventional imaging follow -up may be used in these cases to 
determine tissue status.  
12.2.2. Follow -up Imaging will be used as a secondary assessment for prostate 
cancer in the event pathology information is not available:  
All subject s will be tracked for follow -up conventional imaging between 3 -12 
months post 68Ga-PSMA -HBED -CC (dedicated CT, MRI and/or bone scan) as 
per site standard of care.  If no follow -up imaging has been performed within 
the 9 months following the 68Ga-PSMA -HBED -CC scan, then the research 
study will pay for an additional follow -up CT scan to be performed in the 9- 12 
page 25 of 35 month window post -68Ga-PSMA -HBED- CC scan.  Follow up imaging will only 
be performed on subjects that have positive 68Ga-PSMA -HBED -CC findings 
because conventional imaging assessment for disease is primarily targeting 
suspicious lesions identified by 68Ga-PSMA -HBED- CC PET/CT. Interpretation 
of follow -up imaging will be performed by local read. Preferably, the follow -up 
conventional imaging should be the s ame modality/modalities as the initial 
staging work -up to allow for reproducible and accurate comparisons.  
Conventional imaging standards as described below will be used to determine 
tissue positive for prostate cancer disease. Conventional imaging will not be used to determine negative prostate cancer disease regions due to its inherently low negative predictive value.  
Tissue positive for
 prostate cancer disease based on follow -up imaging:  
 Lymph nodes  will be assessed by change in size.  
i. Positive for dise ase:  
a. -For subject s undergoing systemic treatment (alone or in 
combination with targeted treatment): If on post -treatment 
follow -up imaging within 3- 12 months, visually suspicious 
lymph nodes seen on CT or MRI decrease by more than 30% in 
short axis diamet er and PSA declines by more than 50%. 
- If PSA increases by more than 25% (PCWG3 definition of 
recurrence)  on systemic therapy, then an increase in the 
size of lesion by more than 20% in the short axis diameter 
will be considered a positive for disease.  
b. In subjects with localized suspected lymph node(s) receiving 
targeted treatment without concomitant systemic treatment there are two ways to achieve positive for disease designation:  
- If the subject shows a decrease of PSA by greater than 50% after targeted treatment and the lymph node does not enlarge (change in size less than 20% in the short axis diameter or less than 3 mm increase in short axis diameter) [OR] 
- If on post -treatment follow -up imaging within 3- 12 months, 
lymph nodes seen on CT or MRI decrease by more than 30% in short axis diameter (with a minimum of 3 mm in 
change in size)  
c. For untreated subject s: If on follow -up imaging within 3- 12 
months, lymph nodes seen on CT or MRI increase by more than 20% in short axis diameter (with a minimum of 3 mm in change in size).  
page 26 of 35 ii. Negative for disease:  
- Conventional Imaging follow -up will not be used for 
assessment of negativity for disease.  
iii. Indeterminate for disease  
- Regions with no lymph nodes determined to be positive by the 
conventional imaging criteria described a bove and without 
pathology will be designated regions indeterminate for prostate cancer disease.  
- Subjects that have had neither pathology sampling, nor 
conventional imaging follow up will have all regions 
designated as indeterminate for disease by reference standard.  
 Visceral lesions (non -lymph node soft tissue or organ)  and 
prostate bed and prostate lesions will be assessed by change in size.  
i. Positive for disease:  
a. For subject s undergoing systemic treatment (alone or in 
combination with targeted treatment): If on post -treatment 
follow -up imaging within 3- 12 months, visually conspicuous 
lesions seen on CT or MRI decrease by more than 30% in long 
axis diameter and PSA declines by more than 50%. 
- If PSA increases by more than 25% (PCWG3 definition of 
recurrence) on systemic therapy, then an increase in the size of lesion by more than 20% in the long axis diameter will be considered positive for disease.  
b. In subjects with localized suspected lesions(s) receiving targeted treatment without concomitant sys temic treatment 
there are two ways to meet positive disease criteria:  
- If the subject demonstrates a decrease of PSA by greater than 50% after targeted treatment [ OR] 
- If on post -treatment follow -up imaging within 3- 12 months, 
lesions seen on CT or MRI decre ase by more than 30% in 
long axis diameter (with a minimum of 3 mm in change in size)  
c. For untreated subject s: If on follow -up imaging within 3- 12 
months, lesions seen on CT or MRI increase by more than 20% 
page 27 of 35 in long axis diameter (with a minimum of 3 mm in change in 
size).  
ii. Negative for disease:  
- Conventional Imaging follow up will not be used for 
assessment of negativity for disease  
iii. Indeterminate for disease  
- Regions with no visceral lesions determined to be positive by 
the conventional imaging criteria descr ibed above and without 
pathology will be designated as visceral regions indeterminate for prostate cancer disease.  
- Prostate bed and prostate regions not determined to be positive 
by the conventional imaging criteria described above and 
without pathology wi ll be designated as prostate regions 
indeterminate for prostate cancer disease.  
- Subjects that have had neither pathology sampling, nor conventional imaging follow up will have all prostate and visceral regions designated as indeterminate for disease by reference standard.  
 Bone lesions will be considered:  
i. Positive for disease on baseline assessment:  
- Any positive sclerotic lesion on the CT portion of the 68Ga-
PSMA -HBED- CC PET or on a separate CT obtained ≤  30 days 
before or after the PET/CT.  
- Focal uptake on t he baseline bone scan performed within one 
month of 68Ga-PSMA -HBED -CC PET.  
- Any MRI lesion in bone read as positive on the initial MRI 
performed within one month of 68Ga-PSMA -HBED -CC PET.  
ii. Positive for disease on follow up:  
- Any new positive sclerotic lesion on CT within 12 months of 
68Ga-PSMA -HBED- CC PET scan  
- Any new MRI bone lesion within 12 months of 68Ga-PSMA -
HBED- CC PET scan   
- Any new focal uptake in bone within 12 months of 68Ga-
PSMA -HBED- CC PET scan  
page 28 of 35 - In subjects with localized suspected bone lesion(s) receiving 
targeted treatment without concomitant systemic treatment: 
- If the subject demonstrates a decrease of PSA by greater than 
50% after targeted treatment.  
iii. Negative for disease:  
- Conventional Imaging follow up will not be used for 
assessment of negativity for disease  
iv. Indeterminate for disease:  
- Regions with no bone lesions determined to be positive by the 
conventional imaging criteria described above and without pathology will be designated bone regions indeterminate for prostate cancer disease.  
 STATISTICAL  CONSIDERATIONS  
13.1. Statistical Justification  
This study is a pilot study to determine target sensitivity for 68Ga PSMA -HBED- CC 
for the detection of prostate cancer in the pre -prostatectomy  population. Based upon 
literature, we anticipate sensiti vities of > 80% in this patient population, but there are 
uncertainties, particularly related to the proposed reference standard. We plan to use 
the results of this pilot study, potentially combined with reported results from other 
sites across the US perf orming similar studies (same patient population, same 
methods, same reference standard definitions…) to determine most -appropriate 
primary endpoint sensitivities for a larger University of Iowa study to follow this one, 
so as to appropriately statistically  power the larger study. 
The primary objective of this pilot study is to obtain preliminary information on the 
sensitivity of physician reads for Ga -68 PSMA pre -prostatectomy; physicians’ ability 
to correctly identify prostate cancer and metastates via Ga- 68 PSMA relative to our 
pathology/conventional imaging reference standard. Due to the lack of clinical 
experience with this radiopharmaceutical, this pilot study is meant to gain meaningful 
information of the sensitivity of this agent in this patient popul ation to generate 
hypotheses for further trials. 
To evaluate sensitivity, patients must undergo both Ga -68 PSMA imaging and 
evaluation for prostate cancer  by pathology, follow -up conventional imaging, or both. 
Sensitivity is defined as: 
 
𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆 𝑡𝑡=𝑆𝑆𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑆𝑆𝑛𝑛 𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜 𝑆𝑆𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑆𝑆  𝑝𝑝𝑜𝑜𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆  (𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇)

13.2. Primary Endpoint:   
The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value s of 68Ga PSMA -
HBED- CC PET /CT for the detection of disease on a per patient basis will be 
summarized by descriptive statistics.  
No statistical significance will be generated due to the pilot nature of the project.  
The below criteria will be used for evaluation of a per patient basis with nodal 
regional correlation (Primary endpoint 1):  
13.2.1. True positive patient:  
 68Ga PSMA -HBED -CC PET /CT positive for a regional node 
by internal blind  reader: pathology at prostatectomy is positive 
for a regional node that  correlates in location to the  PET images 
(location on pathology is determined by the urologist at the time 
of the surgery). Only one node needs to correspond between imaging and pathology for a patient to be considered a true positive. 
 68Ga PSMA -HBED -CC PET /CT positive for regional nodes 
by internal blind  reader, pathology negative for regional nodes, 
imaging after prostatectomy demonst rates the same node was not 
removed at surgery, and follow -up biopsy or imaging 
demonstrates presence of nodal disease as defined in Section 12.2.1.2 . 
 Conventional imaging c riteria for positive node on follow -up 
imaging : imaging within 3 -12 months, the node decreases by 
more than 30% (for patients undergoing systemic treatment or focal therapy at this site) or increase by more than 20% in short axis diameter in the absence of treatment (with a minimum of 3 mm in change in size) as defined in Section 12.2.2 .1 . 
13.2.2. True negative patient : 
 68Ga PSMA -HBED -CC PET /CT negative for regional nodes  
by internal blind reader; pathology at prostatectomy negative 
for regional nodes as defined in Section 12.2.1.2 . 
13.2.3. False positive patient:  
 68Ga PSMA -HBED -CC PET /CT positive for  regional nodes  
page 30 of 35 by internal blind  reader, pathology at prostatectomy is 
negative, and imaging after prostatectomy demonstrates that 
node is no longer present as defined in Section 12. 2.1.2. 
 68Ga PSMA -HBED -CC PET /CT positive for regional node  
by internal blind  reader, but pathology at prostatectomy is 
positive for node but in a different nodal region than the node seen on PSMA PET. 
13.2.4. False negative patient : 
 68Ga PSMA -HBED -CC PET /CT negative for regional nodes  
by internal blind  reader, but pathology at prostatectomy is 
positive for regional nodes. 
13.2.5. Non-evaluable patient :  
 Any subject that does not have sufficient data to meet the criteria for definition of true positive patient, true negative patient, false positive patient, or false negative will be c lassified as non -
evaluable.  
 Patients with extrapelvic nodal metastases will not be included in this analysis for the primary endpoint if patients do not undergo prostatectomy.  
13.3. Secondary Endpoints:     
Analysis plan for Secondary Endpoints: We will report t he sensitivity, specificity, 
positive and negative predictive value of 68Ga PSMA -HBED- CC PET/CT over all 
imaged regions as well as sub- classified  by the following regions :  
• extra- pelvic nodal metastases  
• visceral metastases  
• osseous metastases  
No statistical significance will be generated due to the pilot nature of the project.  
Follow -up for extra -pelvic nodal metastases, visceral metastases and osseous 
metastases are defined as below:  
13.3.1. True positive region  
 68Ga PSMA -HBED -CC PET CT positive for extra -pelvic nod e 
metastases  by internal blind  reader – and pathology (if 
available) positive for that node, or, extra -pelvic node positive 
for disease by imaging as defined in Section 12.2.2.1. 
 68Ga PSMA -HBED -CC PET /CT positive for visceral 
metastases  by internal blind  reader – and pathology (if 
available) positive for that visceral lesion, or, visceral lesion 
positive for disease by imaging as defined in Section 12.2.2.2. 
 68Ga PSMA -HBED -CC PET /CT positive for osseous 
metastases by internal blind reader - and pathology (if 
available) positive for that osseous lesion, or, osseous lesion 
page 31 of 35 positive for disease by imaging as defined in Section 12.2.2.3. 
13.3.2.  True negative region  
 68Ga PSMA -HBED -CC PET negati ve for extra -pelvic node 
metastases  by internal blind  reader – and pathology (if 
available) negative for disease, and, extra -pelvic node not 
positive  for disease by imaging. 
 68Ga PSMA -HBED -CC PET negative for visceral metastases  
by internal blind reader – and pathology (if available) negative 
for disease, and, visceral lesion not positive  for disease by 
imaging. 
 68Ga PSMA -HBED -CC PET negative for osseous metastases  
by internal blind  reader - and pathology (if available) negative 
for disease, and, osseous lesion not positive  for disease by 
imaging. 
13.3.3. False positive region:  
 68Ga PSMA -HBED -CC PET positive for extra- pelvic nodes  
by internal blind reader, pathology (if available) is negative, 
and imaging after prostatectomy demonstrates that node is not 
positive  for disease.

regional node  by internal blind  reader, but 
pathology (if available) is positive for node but in 
a different nodal region than the node seen on PSMA PET.

visceral lesion  by internal blind  reader, but 
pathology (if available) is positive for visceral lesion but in a different region than the visceral region seen on PSMA PET. 
 68Ga PSMA -HBED -CC PET positive for osseous lesion  by 
internal blind  reader, pathology (if available) is negative, and 
imaging after prostatectomy demonstrates that the osseous lesion is not positive  for disease  
 68Ga PSMA -HBED -CC PET positive for 
osseous lesion  by internal blind  reader, but 
pathology (if available) is positive for osseou s 
lesion but in a different region than the osseous region seen on PSMA PET. 
13.3.4. False negative region : 
 68Ga PSMA -HBED -CC PET negative for extra- pelvic nodes

for that node, or, extra -pelvic node positive for disease by 
imaging as defined in Section 12.2.2.1. 
 68Ga PSMA -HBED -CC PET negative for extra- pelvic nodes  
by internal blind  reader, and pathology (if available) positive

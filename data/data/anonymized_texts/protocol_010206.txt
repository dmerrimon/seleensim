SUMMARY  
The goal of this prospective, post- market study is to measure  AEON™ Endostapler performance  for 
laparoscopic bariatric surgery against the Endo GIA ™ Reloads with Tri- Staple™ Technology  from 
Medtronic . Stapler performance will be evaluated primarily by incidence and degree of staple line 
bleeding from endoscopic images, evaluated by  a blinded  third -party . The study will include 60 total 
consecutive cases of individuals undergoing a planned laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy  (LSG) . The LSG 
procedure will be performed according t o institutional standard -of-care and all subjects will undergo 
standard preoperative evaluation as well as post -operative care. Relevant data will be collected using the 
Data Collection sheet which should be filled out following each procedure by a member of the surgical or 
nursing team.

STUDY DETAILS 
Patients will be screened based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria below and will be consecutively 
evaluated for study enrollment. Each case will be randomly assigned to one of the two FDA approved 
endoscopic staplers. For the purposes of this study, the surgeons will either use the AEON™ Endostapler 
or the Endo GIA™ Reloads with Tri- Staple™ Technology  and Ultra Universal Handle  from Medtronic . 
Enrollment will be contingent on meeting these criteria, and the use of either the AEON™ Endostapler  or 
the Endo GIA™ Reloads with Tri -Staple™ Technology from Medtronic . Study participation will begin once 
the subject signs the consent form and will end af ter the one-month  postoperative follow up visit.  
 
Selection of Subjects : 
Inclusion Criteria  
• Patients undergoing planned laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy  
• Informed consent for study obtained and signed from each subject  
Exclusion Criteria  
• Planned open surgica l approach  
• Use of staple line reinforcement material (buttress)  
• Revision or other bariatric procedure  
• Patients with a bleeding disorder : known coagulopathy, or Platelets <100,000, or PTT > 
45sec, or PT> 15sec, or INR>1.5   
• Patients with active  HIV or Hepatitis B  
• Patients under the age of 18 on the date of the surgery  
• Patients who are pregnant  
• Patients using tobacco products  within the last 2 weeks prior to surgery date  
• Patients using cortisone or related products  within the last 2 weeks prior to surgery date  
 
Withdrawal of Subjects: 
Subjects are free to withdraw from the study at any time for any reason. Every effort will be made to 
determine why any subject withdraws from the study prematurely and this information will be recorded  
in the Clinical Study  Report .  
In addition, subjects may be withdrawn from the study by the P rincipal Investigator  in consultation with 
the Sponsor for the following reasons:  
• Adverse event  
• Protocol violation  
• Loss to follow -up  
If a subject withdraws prematurely, all data normally collected by study completion should be collected 
at the time of premature discontinuation or at the scheduled discharge. All subjects who withdraw from 
the study with an ongoing adverse event must be f ollowed until the event is resolved or deemed stable. 
At the discretion of the PI, additional follow up visits may be done for subject safety.  
Withdrawn subjects will be replaced, until 60 subjects complete the study.  
 
Primary Outcome Measure:

episodes per group and emesis material (bloody or non -bloody)  
• Correlation of number of reloads used and specimen lengths and maximum widths as 
measured by pathology examination  
• Correlation of reload color used with observed bleeding and patient’s stomach thickness 
by path exam  
• Correlation of outcome parameters with BMI, visceral fat, gender and age  
• Need for clipping the staple line prior to completion of the staple line  
 
 
 
 
  
Steps and Procedures:  
The study will include 60 total consecutive cases, randomized for stapler type: 30 with the AEON™ 
Endostapler and 30 with Endo GIA™ Reloads with Tri- Staple™ Technology . Surgeries will be performed by  
Dr. Yannis Raftopoulos .  
All patients will undergo the s tandard preoperative evaluation pathway. Patients must sign informed 
consent for the operation.  
All firings with the AEON™ Endostapler will be done with THICK MODE for the purposes of this study  and 
shall conform to the AEON™ Instructions for  Use.  All firings with the Endo GIA™ Reloads with Tri -Staple™ 
Technology and Ultra Universal Handle  should be done according to the Endo GIA ™ Instructions for Use.  
To measure incidence and degree of staple line bleeding, a  third -party blinded evaluator will be used. No 
sutures , cautery  or clips shall be applied during stapling  for staple line bleeding , unless required at 
surgeon’s discretion.  Following the last firing, a member of the surgical or nursing team or the research 
coordinator present for the case will count 10  seconds and then capture image s with the laparoscope . If 
bleeding from the staple line requires control prior to the last firing, an additional image should be 
captured before applying sutures, cautery, clips, etc. Five pictures will be obtained from each case: the pylorus, distal sleeve near the distal end of the staple line , mid-sleeve  at the incisura angularis , proximal 
sleeve and GEJ near the proximal end of the staple line.  These photographs will be sent by the research 
coordinator to the third -party  evaluator either electronically or by mail. The third -party  evaluator will be 
blinded to the device of each case. Upon receipt of photographs, the evaluator will evaluate staple line 
bleeding according to a provided Bleeding Severity Scale for Laparoscope  Images  (Appendix A)  and record 
results in the Bleeding Severity Evaluation Sheet  (Appendix E). 
At the end of each  case , the surgical team will fill out the relevant sections of the Data Collection Sheet  
(Appendix C) . 
Gastroscopy will be performed, per standard protocol, at the beginning of the case to suction all gastric contents and decompress the stomach as well at the completion of the sleeve gastrectomy. Evaluation 
for intraluminal bleeding will be performed  at th e last gastroscopy  according to Appendix E. During the 
last gastroscopy,  no suctioning of the gastric contents will be performed until evaluation for bleeding is 
made and pictures are obtained.  The gastroscopy will be performed before any use of clipping a t the 
staple line unless for circumstances judged by the surgeon to be medically necessary to do so before the 
endoscopy. These instances will also be recorded.  Five pictures will be obtained from each case: the 
pylorus, distal sleeve near the distal end o f the staple line, mid-sleeve  at the incisura angularis , proximal 
sleeve and GEJ near the proximal end of the staple line.  These  photographs will also be sent to the third -
party evaluator for evaluation of staple line bleeding  according to a provided Bleed ing Severity Scale for 
Endoscope Images (Appendix B) . Results will be recorded in the Bleeding Severity Evaluation Sheet 
(Appendix E). 
The determination of laparoscopic and endoscopic staple line bleeding will be based on the picture with the highest bleed ing severity score for laparoscopic and endoscopic evaluation separately.  Every effort 
will be made that all pictures prior to any suctioning of the staple line laparoscopically or endoscopically.  
All typical post -operative care will continue, including im mediate post -operative care  prior to hospital 
discharge  as well as the standard post -operative evaluation . A hemoglobin level will be checked at the 
recovery room and at 5am on postoperative day #1 per standard protocol. This hemoglobin must be 
drawn from the upper extremity opposite from the one with the IV running fluids or at the same extremity 
with the IV running fluids but distal to the IV.  For each  post -operative period, a member of the surgical or 
nursing team will fill out the relevant  sections of the Data Collection Sheet (Appendix C) . 
There will be no follow up study data collected after this point, however the patients will continue the 
standard follow up regimen per the physician’s practice.  
 
Surgery Locations : 
Surgeries will take p lace at Holyoke Medical Center  (575 Beech St, Holyoke, MA 01040) . 
 
Termination of the Study : 
The Principal Investigator reserves the right to terminate the study in the interest of subject welfare. The 
Sponsor may terminate the study for administrative reasons.  
Should the study be terminated, all documentation pertaining to the study must be returned to the Sponsor.  Any actions required to assess or maintain study subject safety will continue as required, despite termination of the study by the Sponsor.  
 
Protocol Deviations:  
Deviations from the protocol  will be assess ed as “minor” or “major” in agreement with the Sponsor. 
Major deviations from the protocol may lead to the exclusion of a subject from data analysis and will be 
considered on a case -by-case basis.  
The Investigator will not deviate from this protocol for any reason without prior written approval f rom 
the Sponsor, except in cases of medical emergencies. The Investigator may deviate from the protocol 
without prior approval only when the change is necessary to eliminate an apparent immediate hazard to 
a subject.  In that event, the Investigator will notify the Sponsor immediately by phone, notify the IRB, and confirm notification to the Sponsor in writing within 5 working days after the ch ange is 
implemented.  
 
Risks:  
There are no additional risks to the patients participating in the study other than the known risks of the 
chosen procedure the sleeve gastrectomy. These known risks will be explained to the participating 
patients through the standard consent used for this  procedure. In addition, there are no known additional 
risks from the use of either stapler. Both staplers are FDA approved and the surgeon -investigator of this 
study as well as the OR staff is very familiar with both staplers and loads. The surgeon has us ed both 
staplers and loads extensively in the past (>20 bariatric cases) and he is past the learning curve for either one.  
Statistics:  
This is an open -label study  (since the patient will be blinded and the evaluation for the primary outcome 
will be done b y a third party blinded to the stapler used) . Formal sample size calculations were not 
performed  as the purpose of the study is to demonstrate non -inferiority . The number of subjects was 
chosen based on feasibility and is considered sufficient to meet the study objectives.  
Detailed methodology for summary and statistical analyses of the data collected in this study will be 
documented in the Clinical Study Report.  T-test and chi -square test will be used for univariate analysis of 
continuous and categorical d ata respectively. Regression analysis may be used to identify the 
independent effect of several parameters on primary or secondary outcomes if there are statistically significant differences in univariate analysis.  
 
Direct Access to Source Data/Documents: 
The Principal Investigator will ensure that the Sponsor, IRB, and regulatory authorities will have direct 
access to all study sites, source data/documents, and reports for the purpose of monitoring and 
auditing. In the event that other study -related monito ring should be done by other parties, those parties 
will be required to sign a confidentiality agreement prior to any monitoring or auditing.

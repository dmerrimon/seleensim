PRODUCT  JZP-110 [(R)-2-amino -3-phenylpropylcarbamate 
hydrochloride]  
TITLE A Twelve -week, Double -blind, Placebo -controlled, 
Randomized, Parallel -group, Multicenter Study of the Safety 
and Efficacy of JZP -110 [(R)-2-amino -3-
phenylpropylcarbamate hydrochloride] in the Treatment of 
Excessive Sleepiness in Subjects with Narcolepsy  
STUDY NUMBER  14-002 
STUDY PHASE  Phase 3  
LOCATION  This trial will be conducted at approximately 60  sites in North 
America  and Europe . 
PRIMARY 
OBJECTIVE  To evaluate the efficacy of JZP -110 administered once daily 
for up to 12 weeks in doses of 75, 150, and 300 mg compared 
to placebo in the treatment of excessive sleepiness in adult 
subjects with narcolepsy.  
SECONDARY 
OBJECTIVES  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of JZP -110 
administered once daily for up to 12 weeks in doses of 75, 150, and 300 mg compared to placebo  in the treatment of 
excessive sleepiness in adult subjects with narcolepsy . 
To characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) of JZP -110 in 
subjects with narcolepsy using sparse sampling methods.  
DESIGN  
              This trial is a 12 -week, randomized, double -blind, placebo -
controlled, multicenter, 4- treatment parallel group study of the 
safety and efficacy of JZP -110 in the treatment of excessive 
sleepiness in adult subjects with narcolepsy as defined by The International Classification of S leep Disorders, Third Edition 
(ICSD -3) or Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental 
Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5). Following the successful completion of Screening and Baseline visits, stratified randomization on the basis of the presence or absence of cataplexy will occur. Subjects will be assigned to receive 
JZP-110 75, 150, or 300 mg or placebo in a 1:1:1:1 ratio once 
daily over a 12-week Treatment Phase. Subjects randomized to the 150 mg dose will initially receive 75 mg from Day 1 through Day 3 of the first week of the Treatment Phase and will receive 150 mg starting  on Day 4.  Subjects randomized 
to the 300 mg dose will initially re ceive 150 mg from Day 
1 through Day 3 of the first week of the Treatment Phase and will receive 300 mg starting  on Day 4. Subjects randomized to 
the 75 mg group will not require titration. 
During the Treatment Phase, subjects will return to the 
investigati ve site to complete efficacy and safety assessments

 at the end of Weeks 1, 4, 8, and 12; the Week 4 and 12  visits 
will include an overnight stay at the investigational site for 
nocturnal polysomnography (PSG) followed by a Maintenance of Wakefulness Test ( MWT) , and the Week 8 
Visit will include 24 -hour ambulatory blood pressure 
monitoring . Subjects will take their final dose of study drug at 
the Week 12 visit prior to the Week 12 visit assessments. Subjects will return at the end of Week 14 for follow-up assessments. Unless there are any outstanding safety issues that require follow-up, subjects will be discharged from the 
study at the Week 14 visit. 
Efficacy will be assessed by changes in the mean sleep 
latency on the first 4 trials of a 5 -trial, 40 -minute MWT  and 
by changes in the mean Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS)  score 
as co -primary endpoints, percentage of patients improved on 
the Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIc) as a key 
secondary endpoint , and Clinical Global Impression of 
Change (CGIc), Fun ctional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire 
Short Version (FOSQ -10), 36-Item Short Form Health Survey 
(SF-36v2), EuroQoL EQ -5D- 5L, and the Work Productivity 
and Activity Impairment Questionnaire: Specific Health 
Problem V2.0 (WPAI:SHP) as other endpoints. 
Four blood samples will be collected from each subject for PK 
evaluations; one sample during the Week 1 visit, one sample during the Week 4 visit, and two samples during the Week 8 visit. The samples collected at the Week 1 and Week 8 visits 
will be within 1 -8 hours of dosing. The samples collected at  
the Week 4 visit will be within 8 -12 hours after dosing. 
Safety will be assessed by the incidence of observed and reported adverse events (AEs), and changes in physical examination findings, electrocardiograms (E CGs), clinical 
laboratory tests, vital sign measurements, 24-hour ambulatory 
blood pressure monitoring at the Week 8 visit, and the Columbia- Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS). Safety 
will be assessed throughout the study. 
ESTIMATED 
DURATION OF STUDY Up to 31 days for Screening and Baseline visits, 12 weeks for 
the Treatment Phase, and 2 weeks for a Safety Follow -up (t he 
2 week Safety Follow-up visit is not required for subjects who 
enter the Open -label Safety Study [14-005] at the Final Clinic 
Visit) . 
It is estimated that enrollment across all sites will be 
completed in 12  months.  
STUDY POPULATION  Subjects must have a documented diagnosis of narcolepsy  
according to the ICSD -3 or DSM -5 and have sleepiness and 
an inability to stay awake as demonstrated by objective and

 subjective criteria.  
Approximately 240 subjects are planned for enrollment. 
Approximately 60 subjects will be randomized to each treatment group . These sample sizes  will provide at least 80% 
power to detect a difference of 6 minutes in the mean sleep latency time as determined from the MWT ( mean  of the first 
four trials) and a difference of 4  points on the ESS changes 
from Baseline to Week 12 between each JZP -110 treatment 
group and placebo. This calculation assumes common standard deviations of 10 minutes for the MWT and 6 points for the ESS changes from Baseline and a tw o-sided 
significance level of 0.05 using a t- test.

TEST PRODUCT, 
DOSE, AND MODE OF 
ADMINISTRATION JZP-110 [ (R)-2-amino -3-phenylpropylcarbamate 
hydrochloride] will be supplied as 75 mg, 150 mg, and 300 mg tablets that will be overencapsulated in identical opaque gelatin capsules. The doses of JZP-110 will be based on the free base of the molecule. Subjects will be instructed to take a single oral daily dose of  study drug in the morning, on 
an empty stomach, within one hour of awakening. Subjects will also be instructed to abstain from eating or drinking 
(except for water) for 30  minutes after taking the study drug.  
REFERENCE 
THERAPY, DOSE, AND MODE OF 
ADMINIST RATION  Placebo tablets will also be overencapsulated in opaque 
gelatin capsules that will be identical to those used for the active JZP -110 treatments. Mode of administration will be the 
same as for the test product above.  
DURATION OF 
TREATMENT  The treatment duration of the study for each subject will be 
approximately 12 weeks.  
EFFICACY 
ASSESSMENTS  
 Co-primary Efficacy Endpoints:  
• MWT: Change in the mean  sleep latency time (in 
minutes) as determined from the first four trials of a 40-minute MWT from Baseline to Week 12 
• ESS: Change in ESS score from Baseline to Week  12  
Key Secondary Efficacy Endpoint: 
• PGIc: Percentage of subjects reported as improved 
(min imally, much, or very much) on the PGIc at 
Week  12 
PHARMACOKINETIC 
ASSESSMENTS  Concentration data for JZP -110 will be tabulated by sampling 
time point and will be included in a population PK analysis. 
The population PK model will be used to characterize JZP-110 PK profile in narcolepsy patients and to explore 
exposure -efficacy correlations.  
SAFETY 
ASSESSMENTS  Safety and tolerability evaluations will consist of treatment -
emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and changes in clinical 
laboratory tests (chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis), vital signs, 24- hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, 12- lead 
ECGs, physical exams, and C -SSRS assessments.  
STATISTICAL 
ANALYSIS  For the analysis of t he co -primary efficacy endpoints, a 
mixed -effect repeated measures (MMRM) model will be used 
as the primary method of analysis. This model will include fixed effects for treatment (i.e., dose group), time (as a discrete factor), treatment -by-time interaction, baseline v alue 
of the efficacy endpoint, and randomization stratification factor . SAS procedure PROC MIXED will be used to carry 
out this analysis. All available data will be included in the model. An unstructured covariance matrix will be used to 
model the correlat ion among repeated measurements. The

 estimates of treatment difference vs. placebo and their 95% 
confidence intervals will be presented. In addition to the 
MMRM model, an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model will be used to analyze MWT and ESS to provide sensitivity analyses. This ANCOVA model will include the effect for treatment (i.e., dose group) as a fixed effect, and baseline 
value of the efficacy endpoint as the covariate.  
The chi -squared test will be used to test the hypotheses 
associated with the analysis of PGIc.

 1 INTRODUCTION 
JZP-110 [(R)-2-amino -3-phenylpropylcarbamate hydrochloride] is a phenylalanine derivative 
(previously known as ADX-N05, R228060, and YKP10A) that is currently being 
investigated as a potential treatment for excessive daytime sleepiness in narcolepsy and obstructive s leep apnea (OSA) . Nonclinical data indicate that JZP -110 is a wake-promoting 
agent that lacks the noradrenergic releasing effects of amphetamines (EDMS  PSDB -4956838, EDMS -PSDB -2735318, EDMS -PSDB -5305783) and does not 
produce rebound hypersomnia in rodent models ( Hasan et al . 2009 ). Pharmacologically, 
JZP-110 appears to be a low-potency reuptake inhibitor at dopamine and norepinephrine 
transporters.  
JZP-110 was originally synthesized by SK Life Science (South Korea). The molecule has 
been under development for the treatment of depression and for the treatment of excessive sleepiness in narcolepsy under various sponsors. Jazz Pharmaceuticals intends to complete development of JZP-110 for the treatment of excessive sleepiness in adult patients with narcolepsy and in adult patients with OSA by demonstrating increased ability to stay awake 
throughout the day using the validated maintenance of wakefulness test (MWT) and decreased subjective sleepiness using the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) . 
Narcolepsy is a life-long neurologic disease for which no cure has been identified. It affects an estimated 0.02% to 0.067% of the population worldwide, approximately 1 in 2000 individuals in the United States ( Ohayon 2007, Majid & Hirshkowitz 2010), and 4.7 of 
10,000 (0.047%) individuals in the general population of five European countries (United Kingdom [ UK], Germany, Italy, Portugal, and Spain) ( Ohayon et al. 2002). The 
symptomatology of this condition is well described in the literature, with consensus on the five core sym ptoms of narcolepsy: excessive daytime sleepiness, cataplexy, sleep paralysis, 
sleep -related (hypnagogic and hypnopompic) hallucinations, and disrupted nighttime sleep 
(DNS) (Morgenthaler et al. 2007), with excessive daytime sleepiness  and cataplexy being the 
most common symptoms.  
Based on the interim analysis of a survey conducted in 2013 by Wake Up Narcolepsy, Inc., a nonprofit organization working to improve the diagnosis and treatment of narcolepsy, excessive daytime sleepiness was the symptom most commonly endorsed as having the most significant impact on patients’ lives (77% of patients) ( Unite Narcolepsy 2013). Wake Up 
Narcolepsy, Inc., conducted the survey through a special patient education and engagement initiative called Unite Narcolepsy. The surv ey, which is the largest survey ever conducted by 
a narcolepsy patient organization (1,350 individuals, including more than 1,000 people diagnosed with narcolepsy by a physician), was conducted in preparation for a public meeting held by the FDA on Patient-Focused Drug Development for narcolepsy. At the meeting, patients surveyed “overwhelmingly” selected daytime sleepiness as their narcolepsy symptom having the most significant impact on their daily lives (93% was displayed on the webcast clicker count) ( FDA Narcolepsy Public Meeting 2013 ). These surveys demonstrate 
that a clear unmet medical need remains for the adequate treatment of excessive sleepiness in narcolepsy and that patients with narcolepsy endorse the symptom of excessive sleepiness as having the most significant impact on their daily lives.

 Currently approved medications to improve wakefulness and to treat excessive daytime 
sleepiness in narcolepsy include dextroamphetamine (Dexedrine®), methylphenidate 
(Ritalin®), sodium oxybate (Xyrem®), modafinil (Provigil®), and armodafinil (Nuvigil®). 
Each of these medications has limitations, including those related to efficacy and safety. Dextroamphetamine and methylphenidate are C -II stimulant medications with high potential 
for abuse. Sodium oxybate is a C-III CNS depressant that requires twice nightly dosing. 
Modafinil and armodafinil do not appear to adequately promote wakefulness throughout the day with once daily dosing (Harsh et al. 2006, Schwartz et al. 2003).  
As a result of the findings of signif icant decreases in excessive sleepiness (lower ESS scores) 
and significant increases in the ability to stay awake throughout the day (higher MWT sleep latencies) when adult patients with narcolepsy were treated with JZP -110, as well as the 
urgent clinical need reported by patients for therapies that better treat the excessive 
sleepiness that significantly impacts their daily lives ( Unite Narcolepsy 2013, FDA 
Narcolepsy Public Meeting 2013), Jazz Pharmaceuticals is conducting this study with JZP-110 to gener ate efficacy, safety , and pharmacokinetic (PK) information in this 
population. 
1.1 Background and Rationale 
The MWT is the standard objective measure of an individual’s ability to remain awake during the daytime in a darkened, quiet environment and is commonly used to assess response to treatment (International Classification of Sleep Disorders, Third Edition [ICSD -3], American Academy of Sleep Medicine [AASM 2014] ). Previous studies of 
modafinil and armodafinil in patients with narcolepsy have demonstrated sta tistically 
significant increases in mean sleep latency using a 20- minute  MWT with maximal 
differences in the means between drug and placebo groups ranging from 2.3 to 4.5 minutes 
(US Modafinil in Narcolepsy Multicenter Study Group 1998, US Modafinil in Nar colepsy  
Multicenter Study Group 2000, Harsh et al. 2006). In contrast, data for the 300 mg dose of JZP-110 from t he Phase 2a Study ADX -N05 201 using a 40- minute MWT resulted in a 
maximal difference in the means between drug and placebo of 11.8 minutes. Sim ilarly, data 
from the Phase 2b Study ADX-N05 202 resulted in maximal differences in the means of 
8.1 and 10.7 minutes between 150 mg or 300 mg JZP-110 and placebo, respectively, on a 40 minute MWT . These data suggest that doses of 150 and 300 mg JZP-110 could serve a 
significant unmet medical need to treat excessive sleepiness and to increase patients’ ability to stay awake throughout the day beyond what has been demonstrated with current available therapies.  
Another limitation of modafinil and armodafinil is that the therapeutic effects of these drugs 
do not appear to last throughout the day and are markedly reduced by the fifth trial of a 5- or 6-trial, 20- minute MWT  (Schwartz et al. 2003, Harsh et al. 2006, Roth et al. 2006). For 
example, the effects of  200 and 400 mg modafinil diminished throughout the day, and the 
mean changes from baseline in sleep latency were almost zero on the fifth and sixth trials of a 6-trial, 20- minute  MWT (5 -7 
PM) when modafinil was given once daily in the morning 
(Schwartz et  al. 2003). Modafinil does appear to last throughout the day if given in split 
doses, which is not an approved dosing regimen (Schwartz et al. 2003;  Provigil Prescribing  
Information ).

Page 19 of 101 
  
Similarly , the effects of 150 and 250 mg armodafinil began to diminish by the fifth trial of a 
6-trial, 20- minute MWT, resulting in a mean change from baseline in sleep latency of almost 
zero for 250 mg armodafinil at 1700 hours (5 PM) (Harsh et al. 2006). In addition, the effects 
of 150 and 250 mg modafinil on mean sleep lat ency across the last three trials (3 -7 PM) were 
not statistically different from placebo (for the individual doses or when combined) at the end of this 12-week trial (Harsh et al. 2006). 
In contrast to the limited  effects of modafinil and armodafinil on sleep latency on the fifth 
trial of a 20-minute MWT  (Schwartz et al. 2003, Harsh et al. 2006), data from the 12-week, 
Phase 2b study of JZP-110 (ADX-N05 202) in 93 subjects with narcolepsy (44 subjects 
randomized to receive JZP -110) showed that the mea n change from baseline in sleep latency 
on the fifth trial of a 5 -trial, 40-minute MWT was 8.2 minutes for the 300 mg dose of JZP-
110 (significantly greater than placebo at p=0.0007). The mean change from baseline on the fifth trial of a 5 -trial, 40-minute  MWT was also significantly greater than placebo (p=0.0002) 
for the 150 mg dose of JZP-110 at 5.4 minutes. T he 4- and 12- week JZP -110 studies found 
no unexpected drug- related toxicities and demonstrated that JZP -110 was  safe and well 
tolerated  in narcoleps y patients  under the parameters tested. Taken together, these data 
suggest that JZP-110 might offer an important advance in the treatment of excessive sleepiness in narcolepsy by increasing patients’ ability to stay awake throughout the day.  
1.2 Nonclinical E xperience  
Nonclinical studies have been conducted to characterize primary pharmacology, secondary and safety pharmacology, abuse liability, absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and 
toxicology of JZP -110. 
JZP-110 was extensively absorbed and showed high oral bioavailability (71 to 100%) in 
mice, rats, and dogs. In humans, bioavailability was >90% as evidenced by plasma AUC for parent drug essentially matching AUC for total radioactivity in a human mass balance study, along with urinary recovery of >90% of the dose as unchanged drug. Plasma protein binding was low (8 to 17%) in mouse, rat, rabbit, dog, and human plasma. In the in vitro metabolism studies, no notable inhibition of CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C 9, CYP2C19, 
CYP2E1 and CYP3A4 occurred (15%) with concentrations up to 1000 μM. Notable inhibition of CYP1A2 (73%) and CYP2D6 (56%) activity was observed only at the highest concentration (1000 μM) investigated. However, this level of inhibition is unlikel y to result 
in clinically significant drug -drug interactions with CYP1A2 or CYP2D6 substrates. The 
plasma C
max level after oral administration to humans at 400 mg/day is approximately 7.6 μM 
(1482 ng/mL). JZP- 110 (5 to 100 μM) did not inhibit P-glycoprotein–mediated transport. 
More detailed information is provided in the JZP- 110 I nvestigators B rochure . 
1.3 Clinical Experience  
At the start of the Phase 3 program, nine clinical studies ( six Phase 1 and three Phase 2a 
studies) had been conducted in 262 healthy sub jects and 602 subjects (two of whom did not 
receive study drug) with major depressive disorder (MDD). Of these 8 62 subjects,

Page 20 of 101 
 555 received JZP -110, 185 received placebo, and 122 received paroxetine. Two Phase 2 
studies have been conducted in 126 subjects wi th narcolepsy, in which 77 subjects received 
JZP-110 and 49 subjects received placebo. 
1.3.1  Pharmacokinetics of JZP -110 
JZP-110 is eliminated primarily via the renal route, with at least 90% of the dose being 
excreted as unchanged drug within 48 hours. Following repeated doses administered once or 
twice daily, JZP -110 exposure was dose proportional, absorption (t max: 1.3 to 2.5 hours) and 
elimination (t ½: 6 to 7.6 hours) were rapid, and steady state was reached in 3 days. 
Pharmacokinetics were linear over the mu ltiple -dose (14 day) range of 200 to 1000 mg/day. 
Limited accumulation and no enzyme induction were evident.  
Doses of JZP-110 previously studied in human subjects have ranged from 50 to 1200 mg per 
day in healthy subjects, from 200 to 900 mg per day in subjects with MDD, and have included 150 and 300 mg in subjects with narcolepsy.  
1.3.2  Efficacy of JZP -110 in Clinical Studies of Narcolepsy  
Two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies were conducted in 126 adult 
subjects with narcolepsy. In these studies, once daily doses included 150 and 300 mg/day JZP-110; the doses were based on the free base of the molecule.  
Study ADX-N05 201 was a 4-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study of JZP-110 150 and 300 mg given once daily in adult subj ects with narcolepsy (N=33). The 
primary efficacy endpoint was the change from Baseline in the mean  sleep latency time (in 
minutes) averaged across the first four trials of the MWT at the end of 2 weeks of treatment. At the end of 2 weeks of treatment, the mean  sleep laten cy on the MWT increased by 
12.7 minutes for the JZP-110 300 mg/day treatment period versus 0.9 minutes for the placebo period. The difference in mean change from Baseline was both statistically and clinically 
significant in favor of the active treatment period (mixed model analysis of variance; p=0.0002). All secondary endpoints in this study were also positive including the mean change in the ESS . 
Study ADX-N05 202 was a 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study of JZP-110 150 and 300 mg given once daily in adult subjects with narcolepsy (N=93). The 
primary efficacy endpoints were the change from Baseline in the mean  sleep latency time (in 
minutes) averaged across the first four trials of the MWT and the Clinical Glo bal Impression 
of Change ( CGIc ) scores for JZP -110 versus placebo at the last (Week 12) assessment at the 
300 mg dose . At Week 12/Last Assessment, the mean  sleep latency increased by 
12.8 minutes for the JZP-110 group (300 mg/day) versus 2.1 minutes for the placebo group. The difference in mean change from Baseline was both statistically and clinically significant 
in favor of the active treatment group (two- sample t-test; p<0.0001). All secondary endpoints 
in this study were also positive.

 1.3.3  Safety of JZP -110 in Clinical Studies of Narcolepsy  
In Study ADX -N05 201, 1 week of treatment with JZP-110 150 mg/day followed by an 
increase to 300 mg/day for a second week was safe and well tolerated. The most common 
treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs) with JZP -110 treatment included nausea (12%), 
chest discomfort (9%), headache (9%), anxiety  (6%), decreased appetite (6%), initial 
insomnia (6%), insomnia (6%), and muscle tightness (6%). None of these events were reported during placebo treatment. There were no deaths, treatment -emergent serious AEs 
(SAEs ), or discontinuations due to AEs. Severe TEAEs were limited to two subjects (one 
with intermittent nausea and one with insomnia). JZP- 110 treatment was associated with a 
modest effect on heart rate and blood pressure , and TEAEs suggested a profile of effects 
consistent with those of a wake- promoting drug (decreased appetite, headache, anxiety, 
insomnias, and gastrointestinal complaints). Palpitations were reported by one subject (3%) and chest pain was reported by 3 subjects (9%; all reported as non- cardiac pain) while on 
JZP-110. There were no reports of palpitations or chest pain while subjects were on placebo. 
In Study ADX -N05 202, the JZP-110 dose regimen of 150 mg/day for 4 weeks followed by 
300 mg/day for 8 weeks appeared to be safe and well tolerated. The most common TEAEs with JZP -110 treatment included headache (16%), nausea (14%), insomnia (14%), decreased 
appetite  (14%), diarrhea (11%), and anxiety (11%) ; all of these events were more common in 
the combined JZP-110 group than in the placebo group. There were no deaths in this study. Treatment -emergent SAEs occurred in two subjects (both in the JZP-110 group): one subject 
had conversion disorder and one ha d acute cholecystitis. T hree subjects (6.8%) in the 
JZP-110 group and two subjects (4.1%) in the placebo group had TEAEs that led to study 
discontinuation. It appears likely that JZP-110 is causally associated with insomnia, decreased appetite, anxiety, ir ritability, palpitations, and perhaps nausea and diarrhea.  
In the ADX-N05 202 study, JZP- 110 treatment was associated with small effects on placebo -
corrected changes in heart rate (both measured and from ECGs), blood pressure, and quantitative ECG parameters  (mean heart rate increased from Baseline at 2 hours after dosing 
by 3 to 5 beats per minute (bpm) with little or no change at 9 to 10 hours after dosing; mean 
PR, QRS, QT, QTcB and QTcF demonstrated no significant changes). There were no clinically sig nificant effects on the ECG parameters of PR, QRS, QTcF or QTcB in any 
subject.  Palpitations were reported by 4 subjects (9%) and chest pain was reported by 
2 subjects (both appeared to be non- cardiac pain) while on JZP -110. There was one report of 
palpita tions and one report of chest pain from subjects who were on placebo in the ADX-N05 
202 study. There were two subjects who had TEAEs that were related to vital signs: mildly elevated blood pressure beginning on Day 17 in one subject on JZP- 110 and elevated  blood 
pressure at the Week 4 visit and intermittent elevated systolic and diastolic pressures 
beginning at the Week 6 visit in one subject on placebo. There were two subjects who had TEAEs related to ECG findings: one subject had a TEAE of “heart rate increased” on JZP-110 that may have been related to ECG -derived measurements, and another subject on 
placebo was reported to have a TEAE of “occasional ventricular premature complexes.”

 1.3.4  Safety of JZP -110 in Clinical Studies of Major Depression and in Healthy 
Subjects  
Three randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies (SKUP - 9801, R228060- USA-
10, and R228060- MDD-201) have been conducted in a total of 600 adult subjects with MDD. 
In these studies, doses ranged from 100 to 900 mg/day JZP-110 with the dose based on the 
hydrochloride salt of the drug. These studies did not demonstrate efficacy for JZP -110 in 
treating MDD.  
• Study SKUP -9801 was an 8-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group pilot 
study in adults with MDD of low (100 to 300 mg/da y; N=8), intermediate (400 to 
600 mg/day; N=9), and high (700 to 900 mg/day; N=10) doses (given twice daily) of JZP-110 versus placebo (N=8) (total N=35) ( EDMS -PSDB -2275504).   
• Study R228060- USA- 10 was a 3 -week, double-blind, placebo- controlled, parallel -group 
study to assess the tolerability of JZP -110 200 mg/day (100 mg morning, 100 mg evening) 
and 500 mg/day (300 mg morning, 200 mg evening) in adult subjects with MDD (N=77), with efficacy as an exploratory objective ( R228060- USA-10).  
• Study R228060- MDD- 201 was a large-scale (27 centers, N=488), 6-week, double-blind, 
active- (paroxetine) and placebo -controlled, parallel-group study of JZP-110 100 and 200 mg 
given twice daily in adult subjects with MDD (N=488) ( EDMS -PSDB -3696001).  
Most of the 219 healthy subjects and 600 subjects with MDD reported adverse events (AEs), the majority of which were mild or moderate. The AEs from these 219 healthy subjects do not include data from a recently completed Phase 1 human abuse liability study in 43 subjects because data analysis from that study is ongoing (preliminary data will be  
included in the JZP- 110 Investigators Brochure) . The most common TEAEs that occurred 
≥5% and more often with JZP-110 than placebo across doses of 200 to 1200 mg/day included: insomnia (34%), headache (23%), dizziness (16%), anorexia  (16%), dry mouth 
(16%), nervousness (15%), nausea (14%), palpitation (11%), agitation (10%), abdominal pain (10%), anxiety  (9%), fatigue (9%), concentration impaired (8%), and diarrhea (6%). 
There were no deaths.  One healthy JZP -110-treated subject (1000 mg/day) reported a serious 
adverse event (SAE, confusion) that was considered unrelated to study drug. Four JZP-110-treated subjects with MDD reported SAEs: cellulitis (100 to 300 mg/day), aggravated depression (200 mg/day), aggravated depression and suicidal ideation (400 mg/day), and myocardial infarction (200 mg). The myocardial infarction was the only SAE that was classified as possibly related to study drug (see the JZP- 110 I nvestigators Brochure for 
additional information on this SAE).  
In addition, there were reports of mostly mild cardiovascular AEs in other studies (see the 
JZP-110 Investigators Brochure for additional information). Palpitations were reported by 
one subject in each of the YUKIC 9603-01 and SKUP -9801 studies and by seven subjects in 
the MDD -201 study. Chest pain was reported by one subject in the YUKIC 9603-01 study 
and by four subjects in the MDD-201 study. T-wave inversions were observed in one subject in each of the YUKIC -9603 and YUKIC-9702- 01 studies  and in three subjects in the 
MDD-201 study (which includes the myocardial infarction  described above) . Ventricular

 ectopy (seen on 12- lead ECG) was repo rted in one patient in YUKIC-9702-01 and one 
patient in MDD -201. One patient reported orthostatic hypotension and two patients reported 
hypertension in MDD-201, all three on JZP-110. There were occasional ECG reports of 
intermittent fascicular blocks, intraventricular conduction defects, and 1st degree AV block, about equally common in JZP-110 and controls, and rarely new and sustained. These were usually considered not clinically significant findings or adverse events.  
Three healthy subjects (two on 200 mg and one on 800 mg JZP-110) and two subjects with 
MDD (both on 500 mg JZP-110) had treatment- emergent reversible elevations of liver 
enzymes (alanine aminotransferase and/or aspartate aminotransferase) of 1.1 to 4.1 × the upper limit of normal (ULN). Two placebo- treated subjects also  developed mild elevations in 
liver enzymes. There were no other findings in laboratory safety tests.  
1.4 Summary of Potential Benefits and Risks 
The potential benefits of JZP -110 to subjects randomized to the 150 mg or 300 mg treatment 
arms in this study are expected to be a clinically significant increase in the ability to stay 
awake and a clinically significant decrease in subjective sleepiness . These benefits are 
anticipated from the MWT and ESS data, respectively, from previous studies of JZP-110 in narcolepsy patients . However, not every subject in the 150 or 300 mg treatment arms is 
anticipated to benefit. It is not known if the 75 mg dose will provide a clinical benefit. Placebo is not anticipated to provide any benefit; however, s ome patients receiving placebo 
might benefit from their participation in the study.  
The risks to subjects in this study who are randomized to the 150 mg or 300 mg treatment arms are expected to be similar to those seen in prior clinical studies  that evaluated the 
effects of 150 mg and 300 mg JZP -110 in narcolepsy patients ( Section 1.3.3). It is not known 
if the 75 mg dose will be associated with the same type or magnitude of AEs that were 
associated with the higher doses that were previously studied. Risks for subjects who are 
randomized to the placebo treatment arm may include those associated with untreated 
narcolepsy symptoms.  
Subjects treated with JZP-110 might also experience small increases in blood pressure and 
heart rate in the first 8 hours after dosing. To date those increases have been on the order of 
up to 5 beats per minute, up to 6 mmHg in systolic blood pressure, and up to 3 mmHg in diastolic blood pr essure.  In a recently completed thorough QT study, JZP-110 did not cause 
QT interval prolongation above the threshold of regulatory concern when given at either the 300 mg or 900 mg dose (International Conference on Harmonisation [ICH] E14 Clinical Evaluat ion of QT/QTc Interval Prolongation and Proarrhythmic Potential for Non-
Antiarrhythmic Drugs, 2005).

 2 STUDY OBJECTIVES  
2.1 Primary Objective   
To evaluate the efficacy of JZP -110 administered once daily  for up to 12 weeks in doses of 
75, 150, and 300 mg compared to placebo in the treatment of excessive sleepiness in adult 
subjects with narcolepsy. 
2.2 Secondary Objectives  
To evaluate the safety and tolerability of JZP -110 administered once daily  for up to 12 weeks 
in doses of 75, 150, and 300 mg compared to placebo in the treatment of excessive sleepiness in adult subjects with narcolepsy. 
To characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) of JZP -110 in subjects with narcolepsy using 
sparse sampling methods. 
3 STUDY DE SIGN 
3.1 Overall Study Design and Plan 
The Schedule of Events is presented in Appendix 1, and the Study Schema in Figure  1. 
This trial is a 12 -week, randomized, double-blind, placebo -controlled, multicenter, 
4 treatment parallel group study of the safety and efficacy of JZP -110 in the treatment of 
excessive sleepiness in adult subjects with narcolepsy as defined by The ICSD-3 or the 
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5). Following the 
successful completion of Screening and Baseline visits, stratified randomization on the basis of the presence or absence of cataplexy will occur. Subjects will be assigned to receive 
JZP-110 75, 150, or 300 mg or placebo in a 1:1:1:1 ratio once daily over a 12- week 
Treatment Phase. Subjects randomized to the 150 mg dose will initially receive 75 mg from Day 1 through Day 3 of the first week of the Treatment Phase and will receive  150 mg 
starting  on Day 4. Subjects randomized to the 300 mg dose will initially receive 150 mg from 
Day 1 through Day 3 of the first week of the Treatment Phase and will receive  300 mg 
starting  on Day 4. Subjects randomized to the 75 mg group will not require titration.  
During the Trea tment Phase, subjects will return to the investigative site to complete efficacy 
and safety assessments at the end of Weeks 1, 4, 8, and 12; the Week 4 and 12 visits will include an overnight stay at the investigational site for nocturnal polysomnography ( PSG) 
followed by an MWT , and the Week 8 Visit will include 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure 
monitoring. Subjects will take their final dose of study drug at the Week 12 visit prior to the Week 12 visit assessments. Subjects will return at the end of Week 14 for follow-up assessments. Unless there are any outstanding safety issues that require follow -up, subjects 
will be discharged from the study at the Week 14 visit. 
Efficacy will be assessed by changes in the mean sleep latency on the first 4 trials of a 5 trial, 
40-minute MWT and by changes in the mean ESS score as co -primary endpoints, percentage 
of patients improved on the Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIc) as a key secondary

(FOSQ -10), 36-Item Short Form Health Survey Version 2 (SF -36v2 ), EuroQoL EQ -5D- 5L, 
and the Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire: Specific Health Problem V2.0 (WPAI:SHP) as other  endpoints. 
Four blood samples will be collect ed from each subject for PK evaluations; one sample 
during the Week 1 visit, one sample during the Week 4 visit, and two samples during the Week 8 visit. The samples collected at the Week 1 and Week 8 visits will be within 1 -8 hours 
of dosing . The sample collected  at the Week 4 visit will be within 8 -12 hours after dosing.  
Safety will be assessed by the incidence of observed and reported AEs, and changes in physical examination findings, ECGs, clinical laboratory tests, vital sign measurements, 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring  at the Week 8 visit , and the Columbia- Suicide 
Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS). Safety will be assessed throughout the study.

 3.1.1  Rationale for Study Design and Control Group 
This study was designed to be consistent with the United States (US) Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) Guidance for Industry on Providing Clinical Evidence of Effectiveness for Human Drug and Biological Products, with The International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH)  Guidance on The Extent of Population Exposure to Assess Clinical Safety for 
Drugs Intended for Long- Term Treatment of Non -Life-Threatening Conditions, and with the 
ethical principles given in these guidances which have their origins in the Declaration of Helsinki. The inclusion of a placebo control group in this study is necessary to determine the efficacy and safety of this new investigational medicinal product.  
3.2 Study Duration and Dates 
Each subject will participate for u p to 31 days for Screening and Baseline evaluations, for 
12 weeks in the Treatment Phase, and for 2 weeks in the Safety Follow- up Phase  (the 2 week 
Safety Follow-up visit is not required for subjects who enter the Open- label Safety Study 
[14-005] at the Final Clinic Visit) . It is estimated that enrollment across all sites will be 
completed in 12 months.

 5 STUDY TREATMENTS  
5.1 Description of Treatments 
5.1.1  JZP-110 
The investigational m edicinal product JZP -110 [(R)-2-amino -3-phenyl propylcarbamate 
hydrochloride] will be supplied as 75 mg, 150 mg, and 300 mg tablets (based on the free base 
of the molecule) that will be overencapsulated in an opaque gelatin capsule . The tablet s 
contain the excipients hydroxypropyl cellulose and magnesium stearate, and  a polymer film 
coat (Opadry®). The capsule back fill will be microcrystalline cellulose  (MCC). 
JZP-110 is not a controlled substance under the United States Controlled Substances Act or 
under the United Nations Convention on Psychotropic Substances. 
5.1.2  Placebo  
Placebo tablets are composed of mannitol, MCC, and magnesium stearate, and a polymer 
film coat (Opadry®). Placebo tablets will be overencapsulated in the same opaque gelatin 
capsules that will be used for the active JZP-110 treatments. M CC will be used as the capsule 
back fill. 
5.2 Treatments Administered  
Subjects will receive JZP -110 75, 150, or 300 mg or placebo once daily  as a single gelatin 
capsule over a Treatment Phase of 12 weeks. 
 
5.3 Selection and Timing of Dose for Each Subject 
Data from the ADX -N05 201 and ADX-N05 202 trials that were conducted in patients with 
narcolepsy demonstrated that doses of 150 mg and 300 mg JZP-110 increased  the mean sleep 
latency on the first four trials of  the MWT by 9.5 and 12.8 minutes from baseline, 
respectively , and increased the sleep latency on the fifth trial of the MWT by 5.4 and 
8.2 minutes from baseline, respectively. Based on these findings and the safety and 
tolerability profiles of 150 and 300 mg JZP -110 in adult patients with narcolepsy in these 
trials, this study will further evaluate of the safety and efficacy of 150 and 300 mg, in addition to a lower dose of 75 mg JZP -110 given once a day in the morning.  
In this study, s ubjects will be rand omized 1:1:1:1 to receive either JZP-110 75, 150, 300 mg, 
or placebo as described in Section 5.5. Subjects will be instructed to take a single daily  dose 
of study drug in the morning, on an empty stomach within one hour of awakening. Subjects will also be instructed to abstain from eating or drinking (except for water) for 30 min utes 
after taking the study drug. If a subject fails to take the study drug within an hour of 
awakening, the subject should be instructed to take the study drug, if he/she is able to do so, at least 12 hours before his/her anticipated bedtime. If the subject cannot take the study drug at least 12 hours before his/her anticipated bedtime, the subject should not take the study drug for that day.

well as the titration experience in clinical trials to date . Steady state levels of JZP -110 are 
reached within 3 days ( Section 1.3.1). In the previous ADX- N05 201 and ADX -N05 202 
studies in narcolepsy patients, subjects received 150 mg JZP-110 for 1 or 4 weeks, respectively, prior to receiving 300 mg JZP-110. In this study, subjects randomized to receive the 300 mg dose will initially receive 150  mg from Day 1 through Day 3 of the first week of 
the Treatment Phase and will receive 300 mg starting on Day 4. This titration schedule is 
similar to those that were used in previous studies of JZP-110 in MDD ( Section 1.3.4). 
Although previous studies have shown that the 150 mg dose is tolerated as a starting dose in patients with narcolepsy , subjects randomized to receive the 150 mg dose in this study will 
initially receive 75  mg from Day  1 through Day 3 of the first week of the Treatment Phase 
and will receive 150 mg starting  on Day 4 to evaluate whether titration to the 150 mg dose in 
this study will result in fewer AEs as compared to a starting dose of 150 mg without titration . 
Subjects randomized to the 75 mg or placebo groups will not require titration.  
5.4 Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups 
Following the successful completion of Screening and Baseline visits, stratified randomization on the basis of the presence or absence of cataplexy will be used to assign 
subjects in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to one of the following four treatment groups: JZP -110 75, 150, or 
300 mg, or placebo. The investigator will access an Inter active Voice Response System 
(IVRS) or an Interactive Web Response System (IWRS) to randomize subjects. 
5.5 Randomization 
A statistician selected by Jazz Pharmaceuticals will prepare and retain the master randomization code for the entire study. This statistician will not be involved in the analysis of this study. A copy of the master randomization code will be provided to the head of the Quality Department at Jazz Pharmaceuticals, or a designee in the Quality Department. The Head of Quality at Jazz Pharmaceuticals will sequester the master randomization code. Unless there is an emergency that requires the release of the subject ’s assigned treatment, the 
code will not be broken or released until all study data are collected and accepted for analysis.    
 
5.6 Blinding 
A double-blind approach will be used during the Treatment Phase. All study drugs will be prepared in identical opaque gelatin capsules to ensure adequate blinding. All study personnel will be blinded to the study treatments.  
5.7 Prior and Concomitant Therapy 
During the Screening Phase, p rior (30 days) and concomitant medication use and any 
therapies for the treatment of narcolepsy since diagnosis will be recorded on  the case report 
form (CRF ).

 Any medications that are included under the exclusion criteria for entry into the study must 
be discontinued prior to the Baseline visit as specified in  Section 4.3 and are prohibited for 
use throughout the study as well. 
Subjects may continue to take their usual medications during the study other than the 
excluded medications described in Section 4.3. All drugs other than study drugs that are 
taken during the course of study (approved or unapproved; prescription, over-the-counter [including health and dietary supplements], or illicit drugs) will be documented in the concomitant medications  CRF. Jazz Pharmaceuticals  must be notified in advance (or as soon 
as possible thereafter) of any instances in which excluded therapies are administered.  
 
5.8 Restrictions 
5.8.1  Prior Therapy  
Subjects may continue prescription and OTC medications with the exception of the excluded  
medications described in  Section 4.3. Subjects being treated with medications for narcolepsy 
must be tapered off these medications prior to the Baseline visit.  
5.8.2  Fluid and Food Intake  
Subjects will be instructed to take a single oral daily dose of study drug in the morning, on an 
empty stomach, within one hour of awakening. Subjects will also be instructed to abstain 
from eating or drinking (except water) for 30 min utes after taking the study drug.  Subjects 
will be encouraged not to increase caffeine use during the study. 
The day after the overnight stay at Weeks 4 and 12, study drug will be administered at the 
investigative site with approximately 240 mL wa ter (subjects may receive an additional 
240 mL of water if necessary).  
Subjects will also be given a light breakfast and light lunch at times indicated in the Schedule 
of Events ( Appendix 1) and Section s 7.2, 7.4, and  7.7. On days when blood samples for 
clinical laboratory tests are drawn, the blood samples will be drawn prior to breakfast (i.e., fasting). On visits for Weeks 4 and 12, the light breakfast sh ould be served approximately 
30 minutes after dosing and should be consumed within 15-20 minutes. Caffeine consumption will not be allowed during the Baseline and Week 4 and 12 visits.  
5.8.3  Other  Restrictions  
On the nights that PSGs are being conducted, subjects will remain in bed, and if they need to 
go to the toilet during the night they may  be assisted by the lab tech or other study staff 
member. On the day following the PSG, subjects should be seated in bed in a darkened room during the MWT trials ( Section 6.12.1). In between the MWT trials, subjects will be free to 
move about while staying at the sleep lab. At other times during the study there are no restrictions on activity. Cigarette smokers will be allowed to smoke one cigarette in the 
evening prior to initiation of the PSG, one cigarette in the morning at least 1 hour prior to the

5.9 Investigational Medicinal Product Treatment Compliance 
Study drug will be dispensed and collected at clinic visits and, if applicable, at intervals 
specified by State or local regulations. Subjects will be instructed to return any unused drug 
to the study site. Treatment compliance will be  assessed at each clinic visit based on the day 
of the visit and the amount of study drug that is returned to the site. Overall treatment compliance will be calculated at the end of the trial when th e trial is unblinded. PK data may 
be used to interpret findings of non- compliance  
5.10 Packaging and Labeling 
Jazz Pharmaceuticals will provide the clinical sites with a supply of clinical trial material (study drug) as described in Section 5.1. Clinical trial material will consist of tablets that have been overencapsulated in opaque gelatin capsules and packaged in blister cards .

 6 STUDY PROCEDURES  
6.1 Informed Consent 
All subjects will provide written informed consent before the performance of any study 
related procedures.  Each subject  will be given a copy of his or her signed informed consent 
form (ICF).  
Each subject ’s chart will include his or her signed ICF. After the conclusion of the study and 
the CRF has been monitored, the ICF will be kept in the I nvestigator’s central study file. 
Regulatory authorities may check the existence of the signed ICF in this central study folder.  
6.2 Demographics 
Demographic information will be collected at Screeni ng (Visit 1) as permitted by regional or 
national regulations. Demographics will include the date the subject signed the informed 
consent, and the subject’s age (as indicated by date of birth, month and year of birth, year of 
birth, or age at screening), sex, ethnicity, and race.   
6.3 Medical History  
A complete medical history for each subject will be collected during the Screening Phase. The information will include, but is not limited to, symptoms of narcolepsy (current and past, including symptoms experienced prior to any narcolepsy treatment); conc omitant medication 
use; any medications used for the treatment of narcolepsy since diagnosis; any prior reaction 
to drugs; history and treatment (if any) of cardiovascular, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal, immunologic, neurologic, or psychiatri c disease; reproductive status; and 
confirmation of relevant inclusion and exclusion criteria. Any updates to the medical history 
will be assessed at the Baseline Visit.   
6.4 Physical Examination 
A full review of body systems should be obtained for each subjec t during the Screening 
Phase and at the Final Visit (Week 12) or early termination. Physical examinations will 
include a full examination of body systems (except genitourinary), height (at screening only), and body weight measurements. Height and weight should be assessed in ordinary indoor clothes with out shoes. A qualified investigator or designee should perform the examination. 
6.5 Vital Signs  
Vitals signs (systolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulse, respiratory rate, and body temperature) will be obtained at every clinic visit after the subject has been resting and seated 
for at least 5  minutes.  For blood pressure and pulse rate measurement, the subject should be 
seated comfortably with the back supported and the upper arm bared without constrictive clothing. The subject’s legs should not be crossed. The arm should be supported at heart level, and the bladder of the cuff should encircle at lea st 80% of the arm circumference. 
Neither the subject nor the observer should talk during the measurement.

 A minimum of 2 blood pressure and pulse rate measurements should be taken, and the 
measurements should be separated by approximately 5 minutes. If the re is >5 mm Hg 
difference between the first and second blood pressure measurement (systolic or diastolic reading), an additional measurement should be taken ( Pickering et al. 2005). Vital signs will 
be recorded on the CRF. 
The mean of the two or three blood pressure assessments taken at the Screening visit will be 
used to meet entrance criteria to the study . Body temperature, respiratory rate, and blood 
pressure and pulse will be obtained on admission to the site the evenings before the PSG 
nights at Baseli ne and the end of Weeks 4 and 12; at Week 8; and at the Follow -up visit or at 
Early Termination . 
On the Baseline MWT day  (Day -1), body temperature, respiratory rate, blood pressure, and 
pulse measurements will be taken approximately 30 minutes after awakening (prior to the 
start of the MWT). Blood pressure and pulse will also be taken approximately 2, 3, 5, 7, 9, 
and 11 hours after awakening. 
On MWT days at the end of Weeks 4 and 12 (or Early Termination if PSG/MWT  is 
performed), body temperature, respiratory rate, blood pressure, and pulse will be taken 
approximately 1 hour before dosing (shortly before the first MWT trial) . Blood pressure and 
pulse will be taken at approximately 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 (approximately 10 minutes after completion of t he last MWT trial)  hours after dosing. The schedule of assessment for vital 
signs  during PSG/MWT visits  is described in Section 7 and  Appendix 2.  
6.6 24-Hour Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring  
Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring is a non-invasive method of obtaining blood pressure readings over a 24 -hour period while the subject is in his/her own environment. Subjects will 
undergo 24-hour blood pressure monitoring after discontinuation of excluded  medication (at 
least 5 half -lives) during the Screening Period and at Week 8. Blood pressure and pulse 
readings taken at 30 -minute intervals will be recorded  over a period of 24 hours. A manual 
with instructions for ambulatory blood pressure monitoring will be provided separately. 
6.7 Electrocardiography 
Standard 12- lead ECG s will be recorded with the subject resting supine for at least 5 minutes. 
ECG s will be performed at Screening, Baseline, and at every clinic visit. The schedule of 
ECG assessment is described in Section 7 and Appendix 2. 
6.8 Polysomnography (PSG) 
A PSG followed by a n MWT will be performed at Baseli ne and at Weeks 4 and 12 (or Early 
Termination if the subject is willing and able to take study drug for the assessments) . If a 
subject is allowed to be rescreened, a repeat PSG and MWT will not be required if the results of the previous PSG and MWT in the study meet the current inclusion/exclusion criteria  and 
there have been no changes to medical history or concomitant medications that would likely affect the MWT results .

 The PSG and MWT procedures will be performed according to standard protocols, which 
will be provided in a manual to each site. The manual will include all parameters to be 
recorded, methods, and a scoring appendix. Oxygen saturation will be monitored according to the study center’s standard procedures. Standard PSG parameters will be reco rded. All 
polysomnographic data will be read by a central reader.  
An experienced sleep technologist must be present to monitor the PSG during PSG nights. 
6.9 Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) 
At the Screening Visit, the Baseline/ Screening Version  of the C- SSRS will be administered 
to subjects to exclude any individuals with active suicidal ideation or behavior  
(Appendix 10). The C -SSRS is a  widely used measure of suicidal ideation and behavior . The 
instrument reliably predicts a potential suicide attempt in those who had previously attempted 
suicide and is able to determine clinically meaningful points at which a person may be at risk for an  impending suicide attempt ( Posner et al. 2011).  Suicidal ideation will be assessed for 
lifetime and over the past 12 months, and suicidal behavior will be assessed for lifetime and 
over the past 5 years with  the Baseline/Screening Version of the C -SSRS. The Since Last 
Visit Version of the C -SSRS will be administered to subjects at every clinic visit after their 
Screening Visit including the Baseline and Follow-up visits  (Appendix 12). 
6.10 Clinical Laboratory Tests  
6.10.1  Laboratory Parameters  
Subjects will be in a seated or supine position during blood collection. Screening labs may be repeated one time.  Clinical laboratory tests to be conducted are listed in Table  1. 
The clinical laboratory tests will be performed at a central laboratory. An authorized back-up laboratory, as indicated on the Form FDA  1572 or equivalent, may be used if necessary as an 
emergency laboratory. The investigator will supply Jazz Pharmaceuticals or its designee with the back -up laboratory’s current licensure and laboratory reference ranges.   
Please note exclusionary clinical laboratory parameters listed in the exclusion criteria  
(Section 4.3). In addition, any laboratory parameter that is out of range and considered 
clinically significant (as determined by the investigator) at the end of treatment must be re -
evaluated. The investigator will provide an explanation of all clinically significant 
observations. These findings will be reported as adverse events. 
At Screening, the investigator will calculate the estimated creatinine clearance rate using the 
Cockcroft- Gault formula (FDA Guidance for Industry. Pharmacokinetics in Patients with 
Impaired Renal Function – Study Design, Data Analysis, and Impact on Dosing and Labeling, May 1998).  
 
CLcr (mL/min)  = [140 – age (years) ] x weight (kg) x (0.85 if female)   
                                                72 x serum creatinine (mg/dL)  
 If serum creatinine is reported in µmol/L , the value should be divided by 88.4 for conversion 
to mg/dL.

6.10.2.2  Blood Samples for Pharmacokinetic (PK) Analysis  
Blood samples to measure plasma JZP -110 concentrations will be collected at four time 
points per subject as described in Table 2 and Section  6.13.1. These b lood samples will be 
drawn within the time windows indicated in Section 6.13.1 and dispensed into labeled 
K2EDTA tubes. The actual time of blood collection for all samples will be recorded  on the 
CRF . The blood samples will be collected and processed according to the PK lab manual 
provided to the sites, and the plasma samples will be shipped to the bioanalytical laboratory 
on dry ice as directed by Jazz Pharmaceuticals . 
The bioanalysis will be performed by a central bioanal ytical laboratory.  
6.11 Dispensing Study Drug 
Study drug will be dispensed to subjects at the end of the Baseline visit and at the end of the 
Week 1, 4, and 8 visits or at alternative intervals if necessary to comply with State and local 
laws and regulations . Subjects will be instructed to begin  daily dosing with the new supply of 
study drug the day after the completion of the Baseline, Week 1, Week 4, and Week 8 visits. Subjects will a lso be provided with dosing instructions consistent with the restrictions 
described in Section 5.8. On the day after the overnight PSG and on the morning of the 
MWT at Weeks 4 and 12 (or Early Termination if PSG/MWT is performed) , study drug will 
be administered by qualified study site personnel as described in Section 7 and Appendix 2. 
6.12 Efficacy Assessments  
6.12.1  Maintenance of Wakeful ness Test (MWT)  
The MWT is the standard objective measure of an individual’s ability to remain awake during the daytime in a darkened, quiet environment and is commonly used to assess response to treatment ( Doghramji et al. 1997, Mitler et al. 1982, AASM 2014 ). A five -trial, 
40 m inute MWT will be performed  at Baseline and at the Week  4 and 12 visits (or Early 
Termination if the subject is willing and able to take study drug for the assessments) on the 
morning after an overnight PSG according to a standard protocol, which will be provided in a manual to each site.  
Each MWT during the study should be started at approximately the same time  of the day. 
During the MWT trials, s ubjects should be seated in bed in a darkened room with their back

 and head supported by a bedrest (bolster pillow) such that their neck is not uncomfortably 
flexed or extended  (Littner et al. 2005) . Subjects will be instructed to sit still and remain 
awake for as long as possible during each of the 5  40-minute trials separated by 2 -hour 
intervals. Following a light breakfast, the subject will be allowed to relax prior to initiating 
the first MWT trial. The first MWT trial should occur approximately 2 hours after “lights on” at the Baseline visit and approximately 1  hour after dosing with study drug at all other visits 
at which the MWT will be conducted. If the subject falls asleep  during a trial , they will be 
awakened and instructed to remain awake until the next trial. If the subject does not fall asleep, then the specific trial is terminated at 40 minutes and a sleep latency of 40 minutes is recorded . The subject is then instructed to remain awake (and will be awoken if they fall 
asleep) until the next trial.   
Data from the MWT should be recorded and saved electronically, and any technician notes 
should also be maintained for potential transfer to Jazz Pharmaceuticals  at the end of t he 
study.  
6.12.2  Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS)  
The ESS is a self -administered questionnaire with 8 questions asking the subject how likely 
they would be to doze off or fall asleep in different situations. Responses range from 0 = would never doze to 3 = high chance of dozing ( Appendix 6). Subjects will be asked to 
complete the ESS with regard to the level of sleepiness they experienced over the past 7 days  
at the Baseline and Week 1, 4, 8, and 12 visits (or Early Termination). It provides a measure 
of a person’s general level of daytime sleepiness, or their average sleep propensity in daily life. The ESS is a validated measure with high specificity and sens itivity for assessing 
subjective sleepiness in narcolepsy ( Johns 1991, 2000, Broderick et al. 2013).   
6.12.3  Clinician Global Impression of Severity (CGIs)  
The CGIs is a 7 -point Likert -type rating scale and a widely used assessment in clinical 
psychopharmacology trials to assess severity of illness ( Appendix 13). The responses of this 
investigator -completed scale range from 1 = normal, no signs of illness to 7 = among the 
most extremely ill patients. The Investigator will rate his/her impression of the severity of the 
subject’s current condition at B aseline relative to his/her experience with this patient 
population.  
6.12.4  Clinician Global Impression of Change (CGIc)  
The CGIc is a 7 -point Likert -type rating scale and a widely used assessment to assess 
efficacy in clinical drug trials. Investigators will rate their impression of any change in  the 
subject’s condition f rom baseline  (before the subject started treatment) on a 7- point scale 
ranging from 1 = very much improved to 7 = very much worse at the Week  1, 4, 8, and 12 
visits (or Early Termination) (Appendix 14).   
6.12.5  Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIc)

 treatment on a 7- point scale ranging from 1 = very much improved to 7 = very much worse at 
the Week 1, 4, 8, and 12 visits (or Early Termination) ( Appendix 15) . 
6.12.6  Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire Short Version (FOSQ -10) 
The FOSQ is a 30 -item disease specific quality of life questionnaire to determine functional 
status in adults; measures are designed to assess the impact of disorders of excessive 
sleepiness on multiple activities of everyday living and the extent to which  these activities 
are improved by effective treatment  (Weaver et al . 1997). The FOSQ -10 is a short version of 
the original 30- item FOSQ that has been shown to perform similarly to the longer version 
(Chasens et al . 2009). The FOSQ -10 has been shown to exhibit high internal consistency, and 
effect sizes and pre- and post -treatment differences that are highly correlated with the longer 
version (Chasens et al . 2009). Subjects will complete the FOSQ -10 at the Baseline and 
Week  1, 4, 8, and 12 visits (or Early Termination) ( Appendix 7). 
6.12.7  36-Item Short Form Health S urvey Version 2 (SF-36v2 ) 
The SF -36v2 is a multi-purpose, short-form health survey with 36 questions. It yields an 
8-scale profile of functional health and well -being scores as well as psychometrically -based 
physical and mental health summary measures and a preference -based health utility index 
(Hays & Stewart  1992, Ware & Sherbourne 1992). Subjects will complete the SF -36v2 at the 
Baseline and Week 4, 8, and 12 visits (or Early Termination) ( Appendix 8). 
6.12.8  EuroQoL EQ -5D-5L 
The EQ -5D- 5L is a standardized instrument for use as a measure of health outcome that 
includes a descriptive system consisting of 5 dimensions (mobility, self- care, usual activities, 
pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression) and an EQ visual analogue scale (VAS) (EuroQol 
Group, 2013). It is applicable to a wide range of health conditions and treatments, it provides 
a simple descriptive profile and a single index value for health status. The EQ-5D- 5L 
includes five levels of severity for each of the 5 dimensions of the descriptive system and was developed to improve the instrument’s reliability and sensitivity and to reduce ceiling effects. Subjects will complete the EQ -5D- 5L at  the Baseline and Week 1, 4, 8, and 12 visits 
(or Early Termination) ( Appendix 9).  
6.12.9  Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire: Specific  Health 
Problem V2.0 (WPAI:SHP)  
The WPAI :SHP  questionnaire is a 6-item self -administered questionnaire that measures work 
time missed and work and activity impairment because of a specified health problem during 
the past 7  days. The WPAI:SHP will be used with “narcolepsy” as the specified health 
problem. The validity of the WPAI has been established in a number of diseases 
(Reilly  et al. 1993). Subjects will complete the WPAI:SHP at the Baseline and Week 1, 4, 8, 
and 12 visits (or Early Termination) ( Appendix 11).

 6.12.10  Cataplexy Diary  
Subjects who experience cataplexy will complete a daily cataplexy frequency diary 
(Appendix 3) to record the occurrence and number of cataplexy attacks that they had each 
day beginning after discontinuation of narcolepsy medication  and throughout the 12- week 
Treatment Phase of the study . The study staff will review the diary at each study visit and 
discuss it with the subject at each phone contact.  
6.13 Pharmacokinetic Assessments  
6.13.1  Blood Samples  
Four blood samples will be collected from e ach subject for PK evaluations . One sample will 
be collected at Week 1 and two samples will be collected at Week 8 (one sample at the 
beginning of the visit and one sample at the end of the visit before the subject leaves the clinic)  within 1 -8 hours after dosing to characterize the absorption phase of the PK curve. 
One sample will be collected at Week 4 within 8-12 hours after dosing on the day that 
subjects check in for the overnight PSG to characterize the trough of the PK curve . PK 
samples should be taken within the time windows indicated. The actual time of blood 
collection for all samples and the exact time that the subject dosed on each morning that 
samples are collected will be recorded . To the extent  possible, investigators  should schedule 
the Week 8 clinic visit in the morning to facilitate characterization of the absorption phase of 
the PK curve. 
6.13.2  Pharmacokinetic Parameters  
Four blood samples will be collected from each subject for an assessment of population PK parameters  using sparse sampling . These data may be pooled with PK data from other 
JZP-110 studies to establish a population PK model. This approach is expected to permit 
characterization of the JZP-110 PK profile , specifically in the narcolepsy patient population. 
6.14 Adverse Event Reporting 
6.14.1  Adverse Events (AEs)  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, 
whether or not considered related to study drug or procedure.  
Adverse events include, but are not limited to: (1) a worsening or change in nature, severity, 
or frequency of conditions present at the start of the study; (2) subject deterioration due to primary illness; (3) intercurrent illness; (4) drug interaction; and/or (5) abnormal clinically significant laboratory values.  
• Symptoms of the underlying medical condition of narcolepsy  are not considered as 
adverse events unless there is an exacerbation  of the symptoms from baseline. 
• During the study, clinically significant adverse changes in  ECGs, routine laboratory 
tests, and physical examinations are considered AEs. Any subject complaint associated with such an abnormal finding will also be reported as an AE.

Page 43 of 101 
 All AEs, whether observed by the investigator, reported by the subject, determined from 
laboratory findings, or other means, will be recorded on the AE CRF, with each individual AE to be listed as a separate entry on the AE CRF.  
Subjects should be questioned in a general way, without asking about the occurrence of any  
specific symptom. The investigator should attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, symptoms, and/or other clinical information. In such cases, the diagnosis, not the individual signs/symptoms,  should be documented as the AE.  
Following questioning and evaluation, all AEs, whether believed by the investigator to be 
related or unrelated to the study drug or procedure, must be documented in the subject’s 
medical records, in accordance with the investigator’s normal clinical practice,  and on the 
AE CRF. Each AE is to be evaluated for duration, severity , seriousness, and causal 
relationship to the study drug or procedure.  
6.14.1.1  Severity  Assessment 
Adverse events will be classified by the investigator as mild, moderate, or severe as defined  
below. When the severity  of the AE changes over time, the change in severity  will be  
recorded  on the AE CRF as a new AE , and the original AE will stop when the new AE starts. 
Mild  Symptom(s) barely noticeable to subject or does not make subject 
uncomfortable; does not influence performance or functioning; prescription drug not ordinarily needed for relief of symptom(s) but may be given. 
Moderate  Symptom(s) of a sufficient severity to make subject uncomfortable; 
performance of daily activities is  influenced; treatment for symptom(s) may 
be needed.  
Severe  Symptom(s) causes severe discomfort; symptom(s) incapacitate or 
significantly affect subject’s daily life; treatment for symptom(s) may be given and/or subject hospitalized.  
 
6.14.1.2  Serious Adverse Events and Seriousness Assessment  
An SAE is an AE that fulfills any of the following criteria, as per Title 21 CFR 312.32 and ICH E2A.II.B. Events meeting the following seriousness criteria must be reported to Jazz Pharmaceuticals or its designee using the S AE Report form within 24 hours of the site being 
notified of the event. The event must also be entered on the AE CRF. 
• Is fatal (results in death)  
• Is life -threatening (Note: the term “life -threatening” refers to an event in which the 
subject was at immediate risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an 
event that could hypothetically have caused death had it been more severe) 
• Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongs existing hospitalization  
• Results in persistent or significant incapacity or disability, defined as substantial 
disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions 
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect

 • Is medically significant or requires intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed 
above   
− Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or 
require hospitalization may be considered an SAE when, based on appropriate 
medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to  prevent one of the outcomes listed above in the definition 
of an SAE.  
− Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring 
intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or 
convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization, and the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 
• Suspected transmission of an infectious agent via a medicinal product [for EU sites only; EMA Guideline on Good Pharmacovigilance Practices (GVP) Module VI] 
 Hospitalization is NOT  considered an SAE if: 
• It is planned prior to subject entering trial  
• It is for social reasons and respite care in the absence of any deterioration in the subject’s 
general condition  
• It is elective in nature and not related to worsening of an underlying condition 
 
Complications that occur during hospitalizations are AEs. If a complication prolongs the 
hospitalization, it is an SAE.  
 
“In-patient hospitalization” means the subject has been formally admitted to a hospital for 
medical reasons, for any length of time. Emergency room care without admission to a hospital is considered outpatient care. 
 
Overdose, medication errors, and drug misuse of the study drug are SAEs only if any of the seriousness criteria are met. Details of signs and symptoms, clinical manag ement, and 
outcome should be reported. 
6.14.1.3  Causal Relationship to Study Drug or Procedure  
The investigator’s assessment of an AE’s relationship to study drug or procedure is required. 
The relationship or association of the study drug or procedure in causing or contributing to 
the AE will be characterized using the following classification and criteria:

 Related  
or 
Suspected to be Related to Study Drug or Procedure Some temporal relationship exists between the event and the 
administration of the study drug or procedure and the event is 
unlikely to be explained by the subject’s medical condition, other therapies , or accident.   
The AE follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the study drug or procedure and at least one of the following 
instances of clinical evidence: 
• Follows a known or suspected response pattern to the 
study drug or procedure . 
• Is confirmed by improvement upon stopping the study 
drug or procedure or decreasing the dose (dechallenge).  
• Reappears upon repeated exposure (rechallenge) if 
medically appropriate.  
There is a reasonable possibility that the study drug or procedure 
caused the event —i.e., there is evidence to suggest a causal 
relationship. In such case, the AE is considered an adverse reaction  
(AR). A suspected  AR has a lesser degree of certainty about causality 
than an AR. 
Not 
Related 
to Study Drug or Procedure Event can be readily explained by other factors such as the subject’s 
underlying medical conditions, concomitant therapy, or accident; or there is no temporal relationship between study drug or procedure and the event. 
A reasonable possibility or clinical evidence that the study drug or 
procedure caused the event is lacking.  
 
6.14.1.4  Other Immediately Reportable Experiences  
The following immediately reportable experiences may occur during participation in this 
clinical trial and must be entered on the AE CRF and SAE Report form and reported within 
24 hours of first knowledge of the event by study personnel to the appropriate Jazz Pharmaceuticals contact or designee: 
• Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) with a 3-fold or 
greater elevation above the upper limit of normal (ULN) in addition to an elevation of 
serum total bilirubin greater than two times the ULN , with no other identifiable etiology 
• Liver enzyme (AST, ALT) value greater than or equal to 5 times the ULN  
 
As with other SAEs ( Section 6.14.1.2), immediately reportable experiences must be reported 
on the SAE Report f orm, which should be completed as thoroughly as possible and signed by 
the investigator or his/her designee before transmittal to the contact provided on the form. 
The investigator must provide his/her assessment of causality to study drug or procedure at 
the time of the initial report. Where the investigator does not provide causality assessment of 
the SAE at the time of  the initial report, the event by default will be presumed “Related.” If

 the investigator’s assessment of causality changes, then a follow -up SAE form must be 
submitted.  
The source document to determine expectedness of an SAE, is the JZP-110 Investigator’s  
Brochure.  
6.14.1.5  Adverse Event s Recording and Reporting 
The investigator must report to Jazz Pharmaceuticals or its designee all AEs that occur during 
the study from the time written informed consent is obtained until the final study visit or early termination, regardless of their relationship to study drug or procedure. 
6.14.1.6  Follow -up of Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
Adverse events assessed as not related to study drug or procedure, including clinically significant laboratory tests, ECGs, or physical examination findings, must be followed until the event resolves, the condition stabilizes, the event is otherwise explained, or the final study visit occurs, whichever comes first. AEs and SAEs assessed as related to study drug or procedure will be followed for as long as necessary to adequately evaluate the subject’s safety, or until the event stabilizes, or the subject is lost to follow up. If resolved, a resolution date should be provided, and for SAEs, a follow- up SAE Report form must be submitted 
indicatin g the resolution date. The investigator is responsible for ensuring that follow-up 
includes any supplemental investigations indicated to elucidate the nature and/or causality of the AE. This may include additional clinical laboratory testing or investigations, examinations, histopathological examinations, or consultation with other health care professionals as is practical.  
6.14.2  Post- Study Reporting Requirements  
If an investigator becomes aware of an SAE within 30 days after the last dose of study medication, the event must be documented and reported as described in Section 6.14.1.2. 
Any AE or SAE assessed as related to study drug or procedure by the investigator must be reported regardless of time after study termination.  
6.14.3  Pregnancy   
If a subject or a male subject’s par tner becomes pregnant any time after the first dose of 
study drug is taken until 30 days after the last dose of study drug is taken , the pregnancy 
form should be used to report the pregnancy to Jazz Pharmaceuticals or its designee. 
Pregnancy of a subject or a male subject’s partner is an immediately reportable event and 
should be reported within 24 hours of first knowledge of the event by study personnel to the appropriate Jazz Pharmaceuticals contact or designee. The pregnancy of a subject or a male 
subjec t’s partner will be followed until the outcome of the pregnancy is known, and in the 
case of a live birth, for 6  months following the birth of the child. The infant follow-up form 
should be used to report information regarding the status of the infant.

 6.14.4  Emergency Unblinding  
A subject’s treatment assignment should only be unblinded when knowledge of the treatment 
is necessary for the immediate medical management of the subject or to ensure subject safety 
in the trial. In the case of an immediate medical em ergency, an Investigator or his/her 
designee will be able to unblind a subject at any time via the IVRS. Every attempt should be made to contact Jazz Pharmaceuticals or its designee before unblinding a subject as long as this does not compromise the safety of the subject. If a request for unblinding is received from an Investigator, the Medical Director/Medical Monitor will discuss with the Investigator the rationale for the request. If the treatment assignment is unblinded, then any broken blinding code mu st be clearly justified and explained by a comment in the source 
documentation, along with the date on which the code was broken and the identity of the person authorizing the unblinding. In addition, the study biostatistician will document the occurrence of investigator- initiated unblinding in the section of “Documentation of Statistical 
Method” in the final study report. Subjects for whom the blind is broken will be withdrawn from the study. 
If the request for unblinding is related to the occurrence of an  SAE, all procedures for the 
reporting of an SAE must be followed ( Section 6.14). The blinded SAE will be reviewed by 
Jazz Pharmaceuticals Drug Safety to assess the expectedness and relationship to the study 
drugs and to assess whether there is a potential safety concern for the individual subject or the other subjects in the study.  
6.15 Removal of Subjects from the Trial or Study Drug 
All subjects are f ree to withdraw from participation in this study at any time, for any reason, 
and without prejudice. The investigator must withdraw any subject from the study if the subject states that he/she wants to stop participating in the study.  
The investigator, Jaz z Pharmaceuticals or its designee may remove a subject from the study 
at any time and for any reason.  
If any of the following criteria are met during the study, study drug administration must be 
stopped and the subject discontinued from the study: 
• Suicide risk reported or assessed by C- SSRS 
• 3-fold or greater elevation above the upper limit of normal (ULN) of alanine 
aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) accompanied by an elevation of serum total bilirubin greater than two times the ULN  
• Liver enzyme (AST, ALT) value greater than or equal to 5 times the ULN  
• Creatin ine ≥2 mg/dL  
• Positive urine drug screen 
• Positive pregnancy test  
• Subject demonstrates a QTc value above 500 msec  (determinations should be based on at 
least two ECG recordings performed in close temporal proximity)  
• Subject experiences a serious a dverse event that is  considered  related to study drug  or 
procedure

For all subjects who prematurely discontinue, an attempt should be made to perform all early termination assessments (same assessments as those performed at the final study visit). Subjects should be asked to return 2 weeks later for a safety follow-up vis it.  
The specific reason for the discontinuation should be carefully documented on the termination CRF . If a subject withdraws informed consent, the specific reason for 
withdrawing the informed consent should be stated. 
Adverse events resulting in termination will be followed to the satisfactory resolution and 
determination of outcome as ascertained by the investigator (and/or Jazz Pharmaceuticals or its designee). The data will be recorded on the CRF.  
6.15.1  Handling of Early Terminations  
If a subject terminates early from the study, either at his or her request or at the investigator’s 
discretion, the investigator will record the reason(s) for early termination on the relevant CRF page and notify Jazz Pharmaceuticals  immediately. All subjects who terminate from the 
study early should undergo final study visit assessments indicated in Section 7.9. 
It is vital to obtain follow -up data on any subject who terminated because of an AE, 
abnormal laboratory test, or ECG finding. In any case, every effort must be made to undertake safety foll ow-up procedures. 
6.15.2  Jazz Pharmaceuticals’ Termination of Study  
Jazz Pharmaceuticals reserves the right to discontinue the study at any time for clinical or administrative reasons.  
Such a termination must be implemented by the investigator, if instructed to d o so by Jazz 
Pharmaceuticals in a time frame that is compatible with the subject’s well-being. 
 
6.16 Appropriateness of Measurements 
The MWT is a validated objective measure of the ability to stay awake for a defined period 
of time and is particularly useful fo r determining efficacy of treatment  (Doghramji et al. 
1997, Mitler et al. 1982). The ESS is a validated measure with high specificity and sensitivity 
for assessing subjective sleepiness in narcolepsy ( Johns 1991, 2000;  Broderick et al. 2013). 
Additionally, t he CGIc , PCIc , SF-36v2, FOSQ -10, EQ-5D- 5L and the WPAI:SHP have been 
used extensively in clinical trials  to assess efficacy and quality of life. 
Sparse samples (4 samples per subject) are being drawn at various time points following drug administration to use a population approach to characterize the PK profile of JZP -110 in the 
narcolepsy patient population.  
The use of vital signs including 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring , clinical 
laboratory tests, standard AE reporting, and the questionnaires that have been selected to assess the safety of the study drug are appropriate since they are routinely used to assess the safety profile of d rugs in clinical studies and pertinent to known risks of JZP-110. The

 C-SSRS is able to determine clinically meaningful points at which a person may be at risk for 
an impending suicide attempt ( Posner et al. 2011).  
7 STUDY ACTIVITIES  
Visit windows and approx imate times for assessments are provided below and in Appendix 1 
and Appendix 2. In the case that an efficacy assessment is missed, not conducted w ithin the 
specified time window, failed, or conducted incorrectly, the investigator may conduct the 
assessment outside of the specified time window or repeat the assessment only with prior permission from Jazz Pharmaceuticals. Scheduled safety assessments should always be 
conducted, even if outside of the specified time windows, and the time of their conduct should be recorded. Sites should complete informed consent procedures and collect a signed ICF from the subject prior to the conduct of any study proce dures ( Section 6.1). 
7.1 Screening Clinic Visit(s)  
7.1.1  Screening Visit 1, Days -31 to -3 
Subjects may be screened over a maximum period of 29 days.  
• Review the inclusion ( Section 4.2) and exclusion ( Section 4.3) criteria.  
• Obtain demographics ( Section 6.2) and a medical history, including past (prior to any 
narcolepsy treatment) and current symptoms of narcolepsy ( Section 6.3). 
• Record all prior and concomitant medications, including OTC medications, health , 
and dietary supplements taken during the 30 days before Screening ; also record any 
medications used for the treatment of narcolepsy since diagnosis ( Section s 4.3 and 
5.7). 
• Perform a physical examination including a full examination of body systems 
(excluding a full genitourinary exam) and a brief neurological examination. Record 
height and weight in ordinary indoor clothes (without shoes) ( Section 6.4).

 • After screening procedures have been completed and eligibility criteria have been 
confirmed, provide eligible subjects with instructions on how to discontinue any 
excluded medications.  (See Section 4.3). 
• Dispense Cataplexy Diary and instruct on use (for subjects who have cataplexy; 
diaries should be completed for at least 7 days prior to the Baseline visit). 
• Dispense the 24 hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring equipment after demonstrating how it should be used. Provide instructions for use, guidance for when 
and how the subject should record 24 hour ambulatory blood pressure following medication washout, and instructions for returning the equipment. 
• Schedule a Baseline visit after the Investigator has thoroughly review ed results of all 
screening procedures and has confirm ed all eligibility criteria . 
7.1.2  Rescreening  
Subjects may be allowed to rescreen if the rescreening is approved by the M edical Monitor. 
Subjects who are approved for rescreening must be re- consented and must repeat all 
screening procedures in Section 7.1.1. For subjects who are being rescreened , a repeat PSG 
and MWT are not required at Visit 2 if the results of the previous PSG and MWT mee t the 
current inclusion/exclusion criteria  and there have been no changes to medical history  or 
concomitant medications  that would likely affect the MWT results . 
7.2 Baseline Clinic Visit  
Visit 2, Days -2 and -1 
After a subject  has successfully completed the screening procedures he or she will return to 
the investigative site for an overnight stay  to co mplete  his or her baseline procedures. If the 
subject is being rescreened and does not require a repeat PSG and MWT, perform all other Visit 2 procedures listed below (with the exception of the repeated vital signs during the MWT conduct and the provision of meals) during a single visit on one day. If a subject is being rescreened and does require a repeat PSG and MWT, perform all procedures for Visit 2 as listed below.  
On admission to the inv estigative site in the evening (Day -2), complete the following:  
• Obtain weight in ordinary indoor clothes (without shoes). 
• Obtain a urine sample for a pregnancy test for all females of childbearing potential 
(see footnote of Table 1 for definitions of childbearing potential). 
• Obtain a urine sample for a urine drug screen  (Section 6.10.2.1 and Table 1) . 
• Obtain vital signs (systolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulse and respiratory rate, and oral temperature) including at least two sets of blood pressure and pulse rate 
measurements  in the seated position, as described in Section 6.5. 
• Administer the C -SSRS Since Last Visit version and record the results ( Section  6.9). 
• If the Baseline visit occurs outside of the screening window (i.e. , >29 days after the 
Screening Visit ), obtain blood samples for serum chemi stry, hematology tests and a

 7.9 Early Termination Clinic Visit 
If a su bject intends to withdraw and is willing and able to safely take additional study drug, 
schedule a clinic visit and complete all final visit assessments indicated at the Final Visit 
Week 12 ( Section 7.7), except for assessing whether the subject is interested in participating 
in Study 14-005. Subjects who withdraw from this study are not eligible for Study 14-005. 
If a subject withdraws  and is unable or unwilling to take additional study drug, the following 
safety and final assessments should be conducted.  
• Obtain  weight in ordinary indoor clothes (without shoes). 
• Obtain a urine sample for a pregnancy test for all females of childbearing  
potential ( Section 6.10, Table 1 footnote for definitions of childbearing potential). 
• Obtain a urine sample for urinalysis and urine drug screens ( Section 6.10.2.1 and  
Table 1).  
• Obtain vital signs ( systolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulse and respiratory 
rate, and body temperature), including at least two sets of blood pressure and 
pulse rate measurements  in the seated position , as described in Section 6.5. 
• Obtain a 12- lead ECG after the subject has been resting supine for at least 
5 minutes ( Section 6.7). 
• Obtain fasting blood samples for laboratory serum chemistry and hematology 
tests (see Section 6.10.2.1 and  Table 1).  
• Provide a light breakfast after blood samples are collected.  
• Administer the C -SSRS Since Last Visit version and record the results 
(Section  6.9). 
• Collect study drug and assess compliance ( Section 5.9).  
• Review the Cataplexy Diary (if the patient has cataplexy) ( Section 6.12.10).  
• Record all AEs on the AE CRF that occurred since the last visit or phone contact 
(Section 6.14). 
• Record all concomitant medications on the concomitant medications CRF that were taken after the last visit or phone contact  (Section 5.7).

(excluding a full genitourinary exam) and a brief neurological examination  
(Section 6.4). 
• Schedule a 2 -week Follow -up visit if the subject is willing to continue with 
follow-up procedures ( Section 7.8). 
7.10 Discontinuations 
If a subject is withdrawn before completing the study, the reason for withdrawal will be entered on the appropriate CRF. The specific reason for the withdrawal should be ca refully 
documented on the CRF. For instance, rather than stating “withdrew informed consent”, the specific reason for withdrawing the info rmed consent should be stated. Whenever possible

 and reasonable, the evaluations that were to be conducted during the final study visit should 
be performed at the time of premature discontinuation as noted above.  
It is vital to obtain follow -up data on any subject who terminated because of an AE, 
abnormal laboratory test, or ECG finding.  In any case, every effort must b e made to ensure 
safety follow -up procedures are completed.  
8 QUALITY CONTROL AND ASSURANCE  
The study will be conducted according to GCP guidelines and according to national law. 
Quality Assurance audits may be performed at the discretion of Jazz Pharmaceuticals.  
9 PLANNED STATISTICAL METHODS   
9.1 General Considerations 
All study data will be summarized by treatment using descriptive statistics. Categorical variables  will be reported as frequency and percent (e.g., gender, race). Continuous variables 
will be reported as number of subjects, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum (e.g., age, weight).
 All summaries, statistical analyses, and individual subject data 
listings described below will be completed using Version 9.3 or later of th e SAS Statistical 
Analysis System (SAS Institute, Inc. Cary, NC).  
9.2 Tests of Hypotheses and Significance Levels 
The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of JZP -110 administered once 
daily for up to 12 weeks in doses of 75, 150, and 300 mg compared to placebo in the treatment of excessive sleepiness in adult subjects with narcolepsy.  To address this  
objective , pairwise treatment difference between each of the 3 doses and placebo will be 
tested.  The family -wise error rate will be control led at a significance level  of 0.05. To 
address the multiplicity issue due to the multiple efficacy  endpoints and doses, a fixed 
hierarchical testing sequence will be employed ( Section  9.10). 
9.3 Determination of Sample Size 
Approximately 240 subjects are planned for enrollment. Approximately 60 subjects will be randomized to each treatment group. A sample size of 54 subjects per group will provide at least 80% power to detect a difference of 6 minutes in the mean  sleep latency time as 
determined from the MWT ( mean  of the first four trials) and a difference of 4  points on the 
ESS changes  from Baseline to Week 12 between each JZP -110 treatment group and placebo. 
This calculation assumes common standard deviations of 10 minutes for the MWT and 6 points for the ESS changes from B aseline and  a two -sided significance level of 0.05 using a

 9.4 Analysis Populations 
The Safety Population will consist of all subjects who received at least one dose of study 
medication. This population will be analyzed for safety evaluation and will be presented in 
the tables and listings of safety data.  
 The Modified Intent- to-Treat ( mITT) Population will include subjects who received at leas t 
one dose of study medication and have baseline and at least one post -baseline evaluation of 
MWT or ESS.  This population will be evaluable for the co -primary endpoints. This 
population will also be analyzed for other efficacy endpoints. If a subject in the m ITT 
Population does not ha ve an assessment for a particular secondary efficacy endpoint, that 
subject will b e excluded in the analysis of that endpoint. 
 The Per -Protocol population will include subjects who completed the trial according to 
protocol specifications without a major violation. The type of protocol violations that will 
result in exclusion from the P er-Protocol Population will be identified in the statistical 
analysis plan.  This population will be identified before unblinding the study, and will only be used in a secondary analysis of the co-primary endpoints. 
 The PK Population will include subjects who have evaluable PK data for the population PK analysis.  
9.5 Demographics and Baseline Characteristics 
Demographics and baseline characteristics will be summarized for the Safety Population, the 
mITT Population, and the Per -Protocol Population. The summaries of data will include 
frequencies  and percentages for  categorical variables and mean, standard deviation, median, 
minimum, and maximum for continuous variables.  
9.6 Handling of Dropouts and Missing Data 
For the analysis of the co -primary efficacy  parameter  of MWT and ESS, the key secondary 
efficacy parameter of  PGIc , and secondary efficacy parameter of CGIc, multiple imputation 
methods will be used to impute the missing data in order to assess the sensitivity of the results.  These methods will be described in the statistical analysis plan.  
The assumptions important to the validity of these imputation methods will be examined and discussed in the final study report where the sensitivity analysis is presented. 
9.7 Pooling of Investigation Centers 
Data f rom all investigational centers will be pooled for primary analyses . Data may also be 
pooled by region of country as appropriate for exploratory analyses.

9.10 Multiplicity Issue 
To addres s the multiplicity issue of multiple endpoints and dose groups, the fixed 
hierarchical testing sequence in Figure 2 will be used . The testing  will begin with  the 
comparison of 300 mg dose versus placebo for the co-primary efficacy endpoints MWT and ESS.  Since they are co -primary endpoints, both have to be significant at the 0.05 level 
before the test can  proceed to the next level. The testing will stop when a significant level 
exceeds 0.05. This gate keeping approach will control the family- wise error rate at 0.05 for 
the comparisons of the three JZP-110 doses versus placebo in MWT, ESS, and PGIc. The dose(s) that show (s) significant differen ce versus  placebo in both MWT and ESS will be 
considered efficacious doses and additional testing to characterize the time course of efficacy will be performed (Section 9.11) .

9.11 Efficacy Analys es 
Efficacy analyses will be performed for the mITT Analysis Population. The p er-protocol 
analysis will only be used in a secondary analysis of the co-primary endpoints. For the 
analysis of the co -primary efficacy endpoints , a mixed -effect repeated measures (MMRM) 
model will be used as the primary method of analysis. This model will include fixed effects for treatment (i.e. , dose group), time (as a discr ete factor), treatment -by-time interaction, 
baseline value of the efficacy endpoint , and randomization stratification factor . SAS 
procedure PROC MIXED will be used to carry out this analysis. All available data will be included in the model. An unstructure d covariance matrix will be used to model the 
correlation among repeated measurements. The estimates of treatment difference versu s 
placebo and their 95% confidence intervals will be presented. In addition to the MMRM model, an analysis of covariance (ANCO VA) model will be used to analyze MWT and  ESS  
to provide sensitivity analyses. This ANCOVA model will include the effect for treatment as a fixed effect, and baseline value of the efficacy endpoint as the covariate.  
The chi -squared test will be used to test the hypotheses associated with the analysis of the 
key secondary efficacy endpoint of P GIc and the secondary efficacy endpoint of CGIc  at 
Week 12 .  
For the time course efficacy analysis, the dose(s) that show(s) significant difference versus  
placebo i n both MWT and ESS will be considered efficacious dose(s). For each of these 
doses, additional testing to characterize the time course of efficacy using MWT will be performed.  The mean and standard error of the mean MWT data will be displayed graphically for the dose and placebo. Pairwise comparison vs. placebo for each of the 
5 MWT trials will be conducted at a significance level of 0.05. Characterizing the time 
MWT and ESS

 course of efficacy will begin with identifying the first trial that demonstrates significant 
difference from placebo. If such a trial is identified, the treatment difference at the next trial will be examined. If the treatment difference for the next trial is also significant at the 0.05 level, the treatment will be considered efficacious at the time of the next trial. This procedure will continue as long as significance for each subsequent trial is observed or until trial 5 is examined.  
For the other MWT and ESS endpoints, FOSQ-10 endpoints, SF-36v2 endpoints, EQ VAS endpoints, EQ -5D- 5L Index endpoints, and WPAI:SHP endpoints, a similar MMRM model 
will be used as the method of analysis ; the other PGIc and CGIc endpoints, and EQ -5D- 5L: 
EQ-5D Dimensions endpoints will be analyzed using the chi- squared test.  
No sensitivity analyses and no multiplicity adjustments will be employed for these endpoints. 
9.12 Safety Analys es 
Safety analyses will be performed for the Safety Analysis Population. No formal statistical testing will be performed for the safety analyses.  
9.12.1  Adverse Event s 
Adverse events will be coded usi ng the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities system 
to classify events under primary system organ class and preferred term.  
The number and percent of subjects who experienced TEAEs, TEAEs related to study drug, or SAEs; who died during the study; or who discontinued study drug or withdrew from the study due to an AE will be summarized by treatment. Results will be presented by system organ class and preferred term. The overview will also report TEAEs by maximum severity.  
A TEAE is defined as an AE th at either began after first study drug dose or worsened after 
the first dose. When determining the percent of subjects who experience an AE, multiple increases in severity are only counted as one AE. For example, a subject who develops a mild headache after the first study drug dose (that was not present during screening or at baseline), which subsequently worsens to moderate, then severe, is only counted once under the preferred term of headache. The increase in severity will be accounted  for in the maximum 
severity analysis.  
For all AE summaries, if a subject has more than one AE within a preferred term, the subject is counted only once at the maximum severity and with the closest relationship to study drug. If a subject has more than one AE within a syste m organ class, the subject is similarly 
counted once when reporting results for that system organ class. 
All AE data will be listed. The information presented will include subject number, treatment, 
primary system organ class and preferred term, date of on set, severity, relationship to study 
drug, action taken, and stop date (if available).

 Appendix 4  DSM-5 Criteria for Psychiatric Disorders 
The following selected psychiatric DSM- 5 criteria are pres ented as a resource, if needed 
when screening subjects. The full DSM Edition 5 (DSM-5) criteria for psychiatric conditions 
should be consulted for diagnoses not listed here. 
Bipolar and Related Disorders  
Bipolar I Disorder  
For a diagnosis of bipolar I disorder, it is necessary to meet the following cr iteria for a manic 
episode. The manic episode may have been preceded by and may be followed by hypomanic 
or major depressive episodes. 
Manic Episode 
A. A distinct period of abnormally and persistently elevated, expansive, or irritable mood 
and abnormally and persistently increased goal -directed activity or energy, lasting at 
least 1 week and present most of the day, nearly every day (or any duration if hospitalization is necessary).  
B. During the period of mood disturbance and increased energy or activity, three (or more) 
of the following symptoms (four if the mood is only irritable) are present to a significant 
degree and represent a noticeable change from usual behavior:  
1. Inflated self -esteem or grandiosity. 
2. Decreased need for sleep (e.g., feels rested after only  3 hours of sleep). 
3. More talkative than usual or pressure to keep talking. 
4. Flight of ideas or subjective experience that thoughts are racing. 
5. Distractibility (i.e., attention too easily drawn to unimportant or irrelevant external stimuli), as reported or observed. 
6. Increase in goal -directed activity (either socially, at work or school, or sexually) or 
psychomotor agitation (i.e., purposeless non- goal-directed activity).  
7. Excessive involvement in activities that have a high potential for painful consequences (e.g., engaging in unrestrained buying sprees, sexual indiscretions, or foolish business investments). 
C. The mood disturbance is sufficiently severe to cause marked impairment in social or occupational functioning or to necessitate hospitalization to prevent harm to self or others, or there are psychotic features.  
D. The episode is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication, other treatment) or to another medical condition. 
 Hypomanic Episode 
A. A distinct period of abnormally and persistently elevated, expansive, or irritable mood and abnormally and persistently increased activity or energy, lasting at least 4 consecutive days and present most of the day, nearly every day. 
B. During the period of mood disturbance and increased energy and activity, three (or more) of the following symptoms (four if the mood is only irritable) have persisted, 
represent a noticeable change from usual behavior, and have been present to a 
significant degree: 
1. Inflated self -esteem or gran diosity.

 3. Disorganized speech (e.g., frequent derailment or incoherence). 
4. Grossly disorganized or catatonic behavior. 
5. Negative symptoms (i.e., diminished emotional expression or avolition). 
B. An episode of the disorder lasts at least 1 month but less than 6 months. When the 
diagnosis must be made without waiting for recovery, it should be qualified as 
“provisional.” 
C. Schizoaffective disorder and depressive or bipolar disorder with psychotic features 
have been ruled out because either 1) no major depressive or manic episodes have 
occurred concurrently with the active-phase symptoms, or 2) if mood episodes have 
occurred during active-phase symptoms, they have been present for a minority of the 
total duration of the active and residual periods of the illness.  
D. The disturbance is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a 
drug of abuse, a medication) or another medical condition. 
Schizophrenia  
Diagnostic Criteria  
A. Two (or more) of the following, each present for a significant portion of time during a 
1-month period (or less if successfully treated). At least one of these must be (1), (2),

1. Delusions. 
2. Hallucinations.  
3. Disorgani zed speech (e.g., frequent derailment or incoherence).  
4. Grossly disorganized or catatonic behavior. 
5. Negative symptoms (i.e., diminished emotional expression or avolition). 
B. For a significant portion of the time since the onset of the disturbance, level of 
functioning in one or more major areas, such as work, interpersonal relations, or self-
care, is markedly below the level achieved prior to the onset (or when the onset is in 
childhood or adolescence, there is failure to achieve expected level of interpersonal, 
academic, or occupational functioning). 
C. Continuous signs of the disturbance persist for at least 6 months. This 6-month period 
must include at least 1 month of symptoms (or less if successfully treated) that meet 
Criterion A (i.e., active-phase symptoms) and may include periods of prodromal or 
residual symptoms. During these prodromal or residual periods, the signs of the 
disturbance may be manifested by only negative symptoms or by two or more 
symptoms listed in Criterion A present in an attenuated form (e.g., odd beliefs, 
unusual perceptual experiences).  
D. Schizoaffective disorder and depressive or bipolar disorder with psychotic features 
have been ruled out because either 1) no major depressive or manic episodes have 
occurred concurrently with the active-phase symptoms, or 2) if mood episodes have 
occurred during active-phase symptoms, they have been present for a minority of the 
total duration of the active and residual periods of the illness. 
E. The disturbance is not attributable to the physiological effe cts of a substance (e.g., a 
drug of abuse, a medication) or another medical condition. 
F. If there is a history of autism spectrum disorder or a communication disorder of 
childhood onset, the additional diagnosis of schizophrenia is made only if prominent

(depressive or manic) during the lifetime duration of the illness.  
C. Symptoms that meet criteria for a major mood episode are present for the majority of the 
total duration of the active and residual portions of the illness.

Some people have difficulty performing everyday activities when they feel tired or sleepy.  The 
purpose of this questionnaire is to find out if you generally have difficulty carrying out certain 
activities because you are too sleepy or tired.  In this questionnaire, when the words “sleepy” or 
“tired” are used, it means the feeling that you can’t keep your eyes open, your head is droopy, 
that you want to “nod off”, or that you feel the urge to take a nap.  T hese words do not refer to 
the tired or fatigued feeling you may have after you have exercised.  
DIRECTIONS : Please put a (X) in the box for your answer to each question.  Select only one 
answer for each question.  Please try to be as accurate as possible.  All information will be kept

This scale is intended to be used by individuals who have received training in its administration. The questions contained in 
the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale are suggested probes. Ultimately, the determination of the presence of suicidal 
ideation or behavior depends on the judgment of the individual administering the sc
ale. 
 
 
Definitions of behavioral suicidal events in this scale are based on those used in The Columbia Suicide History Form ,

(Check all that apply, so long as these are separate events; must ask about all types)   
Lifetime Past __ 
Years 
Actual Attempt:   
A potentially self -injurious act committed with at least some wish to die, as a result of act.  Behavior was in part thought of as method to kill 
oneself. Intent does not have to be 100%.  If there is  any intent/desire to die associated with the  act, then it can be considered an actual suicide 
attempt.  There does not have to be any injury or harm , just the potential for injury or harm. If person pulls trigger while gun is in 
mouth but gun is broken so no injury results, this is considered an atte mpt.   
Inferring Intent: Even if an individual denies intent/wish to die, it may be inferred clinically from the behavior or circums tances. For example, a 
highly lethal act that is clearly not an accident so no other intent but suicide can be inferred (e.g ., gunshot to head, jumping from window of a 
high floor/story). Also, if someone denies intent to die, but they thought that what they did could be lethal, intent may be inferred.  
Have you made a suicide attempt?  
Have you done anything to harm yourself?  
Have you done anything dangerous where you could have died?  
What did you do?  
Did you______ as a way to end your life?  
Did you want to die (even a little) when you_____?  
Were you trying to end your life when you _____?  
Or Did you think it was possible you could have died from_____?  
Or did you do it purely for other reasons / without ANY intention of killing yoursel f (like to relieve stress, feel better,  
get sympathy, or get something else to happen )?  (Self-Injurious Behavior without suicidal intent)

SUICIDAL BEHAVIOR  
(Check all that apply, so long as these are separate events; must  ask about all types ) Since Last 
Visit 
Actual Attempt:   
A potentially self -injurious act committed with at least some wish to die, as a result of act.  Behavior was in part thought of as method to kill oneself. Intent 
does not have to be 100%.  If there is any intent/desire t o die associated with the act, then it can be considered an actual suicide attempt. There does not 
have to be any injury or harm , just the potential for injury or harm. If person pulls trigger while gun is in mouth but gun is broken so no injury results , 
this is considered an attempt.   
Inferring Intent: Even if an individual denies intent/wish to die, it may be inferred clinically from the behavior or circums tances. For example, a highly 
lethal act that is clearly not an accident so no other intent but sui cide can be inferred (e.g. , gunshot to head, jumping from window of a high floor/story). 
Also, if someone denies intent to die, but they thought that what they did could be lethal, intent may be inferred.

 Appendix 16  Diagnostic Criteria for Narcolepsy 
ICSD-3 Diagnostic Criteria for Narcolepsy  
Narcolepsy Type 1  
Criteria A and B must be met: 
A. The patient has daily periods of irrepressible need to sleep or daytime lapses into 
sleep occurring for at least three months.  
B. The presence of one or both of the following: 
1. Cataplexy (as defined under Essential Features) and a mean sleep latency of 
≤8 minutes and two or more sleep onset REM periods (SOREMPs) on an 
MSLT performed according to standard techniques. A SOREMP (within 15 
minutes of sleep onset) on the preceding nocturnal polysomnogram may 
replace one of the SOREMPs on the MSLT. 
2. CSF hypocretin-1 concentration, measured by immunoreactivity, is either 
≤110 pg/mL or <1/3 of mean values obtained in normal subjects with the same 
standardized assay.  
Note  
If narcoleps y type I is strongly suspected clinically but the MSLT criteria of B1 are 
not met, a possible strategy is to repeat the MSLT.  
 
Narcolepsy Type 2  
Criteria A -E must be met  
A. The patient has daily periods of irrepressible need to sleep or daytime lapses into 
sleep occurring for at least three months.  
B. A mean sleep latency of ≤ 8 minutes and two or more sleep onset REM periods 
(SOREMPs) are found on a MSLT performed accord ing to standard techniques. A 
SOREMP (within 15 minutes of sleep onset) on the preceding nocturnal 
polysomnogram may replace one of the SOREMPs on the MSLT. 
C. Cataplexy is absent.  
 D. Either  CSF hypocretin -1 concentration has not been measured or  CSF hypo cretin -
1 concentration measured by immunoreactivity is either > 110 pg/mL or  > 1/3 of 
mean values obtained in normal subjects with the same standardized assay.2 
E. The hypersomnolence and/or MSLT findings are not better explained by other causes 
such as insufficient sleep, obstructive sleep apnea, delayed sleep phase disorder, or 
the effect of medication or substances or their withdrawal.  
Notes  
1. If cataplexy develops later, then the disorder should be reclassified as narcolepsy type 1. 
2. If the CSF Hcrt-1 concentration is tested at a later stage and found to be either ≤ 110 
pg/mL or < 1/3 of mean values obtained in normal subjects with the same assay, then the 
disorder should be reclassified as narcolepsy type 1.

 DSM-5 Diagnostic Criteria for Narcolepsy  
A. Recurrent periods of an irrepressible need to sleep, lapsing into sleep, or napping 
occurring within the same day. These must have been occurring at least three times 
per week over the past 3 months.  
B. The presence of at least one of the following:  
1. Episodes of cataplexy, defined as either (a) or (b), occurring at least a few times per 
month:  
a. In individuals with long-standing disease, brief (seconds to minutes) episodes of 
sudden bilateral loss of muscle tone with maintained consciousness that are 
precipitated by laughter or joking.  
b. In children or in individuals within 6 months of onset, spontaneous grimaces or 
jaw-opening episodes with tongue thrusting or a global hypotonia, without any 
obvious emotional triggers. 
2. Hypocretin deficiency, as measured u sing cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) hypocretin -1 
immunoreactivity values (less than or equal to one-third of values obtained in healthy 
subjects tested using the same assay, or less than or equal to 110 pg/mL). Low CSF 
levels of hypocretin -1 must not be observed in the context of acute brain injury, 
inflammation, or infection.  
3. Nocturnal sleep polysomnography showing rapid eye movement (REM) sleep latency 
less than or equal to 15 minutes, or a multiple sleep latency test showing a mean sleep 
latency less than or equal to 8 minutes and two or more sleep-onset REM periods.

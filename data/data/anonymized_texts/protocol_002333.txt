Study 19385A –Clinical Study Protocol Page 6of 98Study Methodology
This is an inte rventional, open -label, fixed-dose multiple administration study to evaluate the long -term 
treatment with eptinezumab in patients with cCH.
The target population for this study is defined as patients with cCH, based on the International Headache 
Society International Classification of Headache Disorders third edition (IHS ICHD -3) classification, with 
documented evidence of cCH prior to screening and confirmed via prospectively -collected information in the 
eDiary during the Screening Period.
The total study duration from the Screening Visit to the Safety Follow -up (SFU) Visit is approximately 
60weeks and includes Screening Period (4 weeks), Treatment Period (48 weeks), and SFU Period (8 weeks).
Eligible patients will receive four infusions with eptinezumab 4 00 mg at 12 -week intervals at Day 0 (Visit 2), 
at the end of Weeks 12 (Visit 5), 24 (Visit 8) and 36 (Visit 11), administered as an intravenous (IV) infusion 
over 45 minutes (+15 minutes).
The SFU Visit will take place at Week 56 (Visit 15) that is 20 weeks (5 half -lives) after the last eptinezumab 
administration.
Patients who withdraw from the study, except for those who withdraw their consent, will be asked to attend a 
Withdrawal Visit as soon as possible and a further SFU Visit, scheduled 20 weeks (5half-lives) after the last 
eptinezumab administration.
Patients who are withdrawn from the treatment will be given the opportunity to remain in the study at the 
discretion of the investigator. Patients will be expected to attend all scheduled study visits and procedures 
except eptinezumab administration. If patients refuse, they will be asked to attend a Withdrawal Visit as soon 
as possible and a further SFU Visit, scheduled 20 weeks (5 half -lives) after the last eptinezumab 
administration.
Eligibility will be assessed during the Screening Period and before the first administration of eptinezumab at 
the Baseline Visit (Day 0 /Visit 2).
Study visits:
The following visits will be site visits: Screening Visit at Week -4 (Visit 1), Investigational Medicinal 
Product (IMP) Visits at Weeks 0, 12, 24 and 36 (Visits 2, 5, 8 and 11), Completion Visit at Week 48 
(Visit 14) and SFU Visit at Week 56 (Visit 15) or Withdrawal Visit, if applicable.
All other study visits will be phone contact visits.
In exceptional situations to be approved by the Contract Research Organisation’s ( CRO ) medical monitor, 
site visits may only consist of blood and urine sampling ( for clinical safety laboratory tests, exploratory
eptinezumab quantification, ADA including NAb, and exploratory biomarkers) , ECG, vital signs, physical 
and neurological examination s, adverse events recording, and eptinezumab administration, while the 
remaining assessments (eDiary, electronic patient -reported outcomes [ePROs], C -SSRS, and investigator 
evaluations) can be conducted remotely as virtual clinic visits in line with the Un ited States Food and Drug 
Administration (US FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA) guidance .
Patients will be assigned an eDiary at the beginning of the Screening Period (Visit 1, Week -4) and will be 
required to complete it:
Daily -during the Screenin g Period (from Week -4 to Day 0) and during the first 4 weeks that follow each 
eptinezumab infusion (Weeks 1 to 4, 13 to 16, 25 to 28, and 37 to 40).
Weekly -for Weeks 5 to 12, 17 to 24, 29 to 36, and 41 to 48.
During the study visits with eptinezumab infusion, eDiary and ePROs must be completed prior to infusion and 
prior to any interaction with the clinical site staff.
At these visits, safety assessments will be performed before and after the infusion. Safety assessments before 
eptinezumab infusion consi sts of vital signs including body temperature, weight, concomitant medications, 
adverse events, ECG, blood sampling (for clinical safety laboratory tests , exploratory eptinezumab
quantification, and ADA including NAb), urine sampling (for clinical safety l aboratory and pregnancy tests) 
and C-SSRS. Safety assessments after eptinezumab infusion consists of vital signs including body 
temperature, and adverse events.

Study 19385A –Clinical Study Protocol Page 10of 98Assessment Details
The assessments are summarised in Panel 2. Details for selected assessments which are non -standard/require 
more explanation/description are provided below. All scales used to assess efficacy and pharmacoeconomic 
information in this s tudy, are patient -reported instruments.
eDiary
Patients will complete a cluster headache eDiary daily during the Screening Period (from Week -4 to Day 0) 
and during the first 4 weeks that follow each eptinezumab infusion (Weeks 1 to 4, 13 to 16, 25 to 28, and 37 to 
40) and weekly for Weeks 5 to 12, 17 to 24, 29 to 36, and 41 to 48. The eDiary consists of applications and 
reports which will be used to derive the cluster headache endpoints and abortive medication use. The eDiary 
will be distributed to each pa tient at the Screening Visit after patient training on eDiary use by the clinical site 
staff. The eDiary data from the 4 -week Screening Period will be used to determine eligibility criteria, baseline 
cluster headache characteristics and eDiary compliance. Ongoing evaluation of eDiary compliance will be 
performed by the clinical site based on eDiary reports.
Sleep Impact Scale (SIS)
The SIS is a patient -reported scale to assess quality of life resulting from sleep disturbance. The SIS domains 
cover sleep imp act on daily activities, emotional well -being, emotional impact, energy/fatigue, social well -
being, mental fatigue, and satisfaction with sleep. Each item is rated on a scale ranging from 1 (always/all of the 
time/very satisfied) to 5 (never/none of the ti me/very dissatisfied). Scores by domains are ranging from 0 to 
100; items within each domain are summed and transformed using a formula. A higher score indicates better 
quality of life.
Health Care Resource Utilization (HCRU)
Cluster headache -specific HCRU information will be collected in terms of outpatient health care professional 
visits, emergency room visits, hospital admissions, as well as duration of hospital stays during the past 4 weeks . 
Clinical site personnel and patients will be instructed to cap ture utilization that takes place outside of visits 
associated with their participation in the clinical study.
Statistical Methodology
The following analysis sets will be used to analyse and present the data:
all-patients -enrolled set (APES) -all-patients -enrolled
all-patients -treated set (APTS) -all patients in the APES who receive infusion with eptinezumab
full-analysis set (FAS) -all patients in the APTS who ha vea valid assessment of the baseline number of 
monthly attacks and a post-baseline assessment of number of monthly attacks.
The safety and tolerability analyses, and the exposure, disposition, and demographics and baseline 
characteristics will be based on the APTS. The efficacy analyses will be based on the FAS.
Primary a nalysis
The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the long -term safety and tolerability of eptinezumab in 
patients with cCH. This will be evaluated based on the collected data on adverse events, vital signs, weight, 
ECGs, clinical safety laboratory test values, C- SSRS, ADA and NAbs. Adverse events will be summarised for 
the full study and by 3- month periods, absolute values and changes from baseline for vital signs, weight, 
ECGs, clinical safety laboratory test values will be summarised by visit. Th e number of patients exceeding the 
PCS values will be tabulated. The incidence, kinetics and magnitude of ADA and NAb response(s) will be 
evaluated.
Secondary analysis
Details on derivations and imputations of eDiary data (daily or weekly data entries) , as well as sub -group 
analyses, will be described in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).
For continuous endpoints, descriptive statistics for absolute values and changes from baseline ,when 
appropriate ,will be provided by visit. In addition, continuous end points will be modelled using mixed models 
for repeated measurements (MMRM) including baseline score, visit and baseline interacting with visit, if 
applicable. The estimated means, standard errors and confidence intervals (CIs) will be provided by visit. F or 
response variables the counts, percentages and CI will be presented by visit.

No formal testing will be done. 
Sample Size Considerations
In line with the International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) E1 guideline,1thisstudy aims at providing data 
in 100 patients exposed to eptinezumab for 1 year. Dodick (2020),2in patients suffering from cCH included in a 
12-week study, reports less than 4% withdrawals. In the European Union Drug Regulating Authorities Clinical 
Trial s (EudraCT )report for study [STUDY_ID_REMOVED],3in patients suffering from cCH, approximately 7% of 
patients dropped out from the first 12
-week period; the withdrawals due to the “sponsor terminated study” are 
not included as a reason for withdrawal. As the wi thdrawal rate for a long- term study like the current study is 
unknown, 125 patients are planned to be enrolled and treated, allowing for 100 patients to complete, with a 
withdrawal rate of 20%. The withdrawal rate will be monitored during the study conduct , and if a clear 
deviation from the assumed withdrawal rate is observed, the number of patients enrolled and treated might be 
increased to ensure that data is available for a sufficient number of patients with long -term exposure.

aThis visit should be a site visit.
bFor phone visits, the patient will be contacted for eDiary compliance check, to ensure that the selected assess-
ments have been com pleted and for collection of relevant information such as adverse event s and concomi-
tant medications.
cThe SFU Visit should be scheduled 20 weeks (5 half -lives) after the last eptinezumab administration.
dPatients who withdraw from the study , except for those who withdraw their consent, will be asked to attend a 
Withdrawal Visit as soon as possible.
eIf the date of a clinic visit or phone contact does not conform to the schedule, subsequent visits should be 
planned to maintain the visit schedule relative to the Baseline Visit (Day 0/Visit 2).

At the Screening Visit, the patient will be asked to sign the main Informed Consent Form (ICF) , and the ICF
for blood sampling for pharmacogenetics (optional). Depending of the country requirements, the number of

Study 19385A –Clinical Study Protocol Page 16of 98ICFs may be different. Under exceptional circumstances, the discussion with the patients about the Informed 
Consent Form(s) can be done as a virtual clinic visit and the Informed Consent Form(s) can be provided re-
motely in line with the US FDA and EMA guidances. According to the EMA guidance, this could comprise 
contacting the patients via phone or video -calls and obtaining oral consents, to be documented in the patients' 
medical records, supplemented wi th email confirmation. Any consent obtained this way should be docu-
mented and confirmed by way of normal consent procedures at the earliest opportunity when the patients are 
back at the clinical sites.
gPatients must have adequately documented records or reliable history of cCH and previous treatment for cCH
within the 12 months prior to the Screening Visit. See protocol (sectio n 12) for definition of adequately docu-
mented records.
hDuring the Treatment Period, ePROs which are scheduled in alignment with a clinic visit can be completed in 
the clinic or in the remote setting within 3daysprior to the scheduled clinic visit date. ePROs which are 
schedu led in alignment with a phone contact must be completed in the remote setting and can be completed 
on the day or within 3daysprior to the scheduled phone contact date.
iAt the Screening Visit, the patient must be assisted with the provisioning and training of the eDiary and 
ePROs. Details will be provided in a separate training module.
jPatients must complete the eDiary daily during t he Screening Period (from Week -
4 to Day 0) and during the 
first 4 weeks that follow each eptinezum ab infusion (Weeks 1 to 4, 13 to 16, 25 to 28, and 37 to 40) and 
weekly for Weeks 5 to 12, 17 to 24, 29 to 36, and 41 to 48 .
kPatients must complete the daily eDiary and ePRO entries prior to infusion and prior to any interaction with 
theclinical site st aff.
lIn addition to the eDiary compliance checks performed at the defined study visits, ongoing evaluation of eDi-
ary compliance will be performed by the clinical site (based on eDiary reporting) and more frequent contact 
with patients may be performed in case of non -compliance.
mAt IMP Visits, twoblood samples will be collected for exploratory eptinezumab quantification and explora-
tory biomarkers –one sample prior to the eptinezumab infusion and one sample 1hour after the end of the 
infusion.
nInfusion must be preceded by the assessment of vital signs (including body temperature ), weight, concomi-
tant medications, adverse events, ECG, blood sampling (for clinical safety laboratory tests , exploratory epti-
nezumab quantification, ADA including N Ab, and exploratory biomarkers ), urine sampling (for clinical 
safety laboratory and pregnancy tests) and C -SSRS. Vital signs must be assessed prior to blood sampling.
oVital signs (including body temperature )and adverse events must be checked both prior to and after infusion. 
Vital signs must be assessed prior to blood sampling.
pPhysical and neurological examinations for all clinic visits after the Screening Visit are to be conducted at the 
discretion of the investigator. If these examination s are conducted at an IMP Visit, these must be performed 
prior to the infusion.
q C-SSRS will be administered by the authori sed rater at the clinic.
rBiobank may be excluded or optional per local regulation.
sExploratory gene expression profiling (ribonu cleic acid [ RNA ]) and metabolomics/proteomics, including 
blood sampling for exploratory eptinezumab quantification, ADA biobanking and exploratory biomarkers, is 
covered by the main Informed Consent Form .
tSampling for pharmacogenetics is optional and cov ered by a separate Informed Consent Form .
uBlood samples for safety ADA/NAb assessments and ADA biobanking (possible future analysis) will be
drawn at Day 0/Visit 2, prior to the second eptinezumab infusion (Week 12/Visit 5), prior to the third epti-
nezumab infusion (Week 24/Visit 8), prior to the fourth eptinezumab infusion (Week 36/Visit 11), Comple-
tion Visit (Week 48/Visit 14), SFU Visit (Week 56/Visit 15). A Withdra wal Visit (if the patient withdraws) 
sample will only be drawn for the safety ADA/NAb assessments when applicable.
vPatients must be monitored during the infusion and for a period of 1hour from the end ofinfusion. Patients
will be requested to stay long er should the investigator or designee determine this is clinically warranted.
wThe eDiary closeout will take place at Completion Visit (Week 48/Visit 1 4) / Withdrawal Visit (for patients 
who withdraw). Details will be provided in a separate training modu le.

Study 19385A –Clinical Study Protocol Page 27of 981Introduction
1.1 Background
1.1.1 Overview
Chronic cluster headache (cCH) is a rare but disabling primary headache disorder 
characterized by attacks of intense unilateral headache, frequently associated with autonomic 
symptoms such as lacrimation, conjunctival injection, and nasal congestion ( International 
Headache Society International Classification of Headache Disorders third edition [IHS 
ICHD -3]).4The diagnosis of cCH is distinctly recognized and defined by the ICHD -3. The 
natural course of illness of cCH can be conceptualized as cluster headache attacks occurring 
for 1 year or longer without remission, or with remission periods lasting less than 3 months.
The social impact of cluster headache is considerable5and is associated with considerable 
direct and indirect economic consequences.6Cluster headache has a prevalence of 0.1% with 
a 2 to 6 times higher average incidence rate for males compared to females.7Howeve r, the 
ratio might be lower due to misdiagnosis of cluster headache in females compared to males.8
The life time prevalence of cluster headache , based on a meta -analysis, showed a mean 
prevalence of 124 per 100,000, where episodic form was 6 times more prevalent than the 
chronic form.7
There are significant unmet needs for just about every clinical aspect of cluster headache , 
particularly related to the severity of the disease , the diagnostic challenges and the available 
treatment options. Most patients experiencing cluster headache attacks rate their pain intensity 
as near to or at the worst pain imaginable (using a 10- cm Visual Analog Scale [VAS] ) .9
The pharmacological armamentarium in cluster headache consists of acute / abortive 
therapies, transitional therapies and preventive treatments. First line of acute treatment is 
sumatriptan administered subcutaneously10, 11, 12and inhalation of 100% oxygen.13, 14, 15, 16
Transitional therapies are often used to relieve the patient until the preventive agents are 
adequately titrated, and consists of oral steroids or greater occipital nerve (GON) blocks.17, 18
The currently available preventive pharmacological treatments are unspecific, insufficient, 
and hampered by side -effects. Preventive treatment aims to reduce attack frequency with 
verapamil being first -choice, but only 50 to 80% of cluster headache patients are responders;19
and its use is hampered by side- effects since many patients need high doses. Other preventive 
treatments are less attractive due to their side- effect profile, the scarcity of evidence20, 21and 
high cost.22In the clinic, several types of treatment are combined in the effort to provide relief 
to the patients and improve the quality of life.
Increased plasma or serum levels of calcitonin gene -related peptide (CGRP) have been 
associated with painful syndromes such as migraine and cluster headache .23Cluster headache 
patients have higher CGRP levels compared to migraine patients and healthy controls.24As in 
migraine,25CGRP levels are altered during attacks. Recently, a provocation study supported 
the central role of CGRP involvement in cluster headache as infusion of CGRP induced 
attacks in patients with cCH and in patients with episodic cluster headache in an active b out.26

Study 19385A –Clinical Study Protocol Page 28of 98Eptinezumab is a humanised monoclonal antibody (mAb) that inhibits the action of CGRP 
and is approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) as the first 
and only intravenous (IV) preventive treatment for migraine. Results from t wo 
placebo- controlled, Phase III studies showed that eptinezumab led to asignificant reduction in 
the number of monthly migraine days in patients with migraine: both in episodic and chronic 
migraine (study ALD403 -CLIN -006,27and ALD403 -CLIN -011,28respect ively). The IV
administration of eptinezumab and its fast onset of action make it a good candidate for 
treatment of patients with cluster headache because an early effect is needed due to the 
relatively short duration and intense severity of the attacks. C luster headache and migraine 
share some similarities, including the active role of CGRP in the disease biology, and put 
together with the clinical efficacy in migraine, the evidence supports the hypothesis of 
eptinezumab being effective in the treatment of cluster headache .
The following sections 1.1.2 and1.1.3 provide a brief overview of the nonclinical and clinical 
data currently avai lable for eptinezumab . Refer to the current version of the Investigator’s 
Brochure29for more detailed information.
1.1.2 Nonclinical Data
Data from the comprehensive program of nonclinical studies support the clinical mechanism 
of action and safety of eptinezum ab.
To demonstrate the ability of eptinezumab to block CGRP -driven vasodilation in vivo , several 
primary pharmacodynamic animal studies were conducted in rat, cynomolgus monkey and 
rabbit. The administration of eptinezumab was well tolerated at doses up to 100 mg/kg, the 
highest dose administered, and inhibited increases in dermal blood perf usion induced by 
either topical capsaicin (rats and monkey) or intradermal β -CGRP challenge (rabbit). The 
pharmacodynamic effects were dose -dependent and occurred from 0.1 mg/kg. The 
appropriateness of the nonclinical species has been established in vitro (rat and rabbit). Across 
species (including human), eptinezumab has a binding affinity in the low picomolar range for 
α-and β -CGRP and has been shown to functionally inhibit α -and β -CGRP with high 
specificity.
Intravenous administration of eptinezumab, either as a single -or multiple -dose for 1 -month 
duration up to 100 mg/kg/dose in rats or monkeys, or multiple -dose for 6- months duration up 
to 150 mg/kg/dose in monkeys, was well tolerated. No mortality or adverse findings attributed 
to the pharmacological a ctivity of eptinezumab were observed in the single -or repeat- dose 
studies in rats or cynomolgus monkeys. As determined during a 6 -month chronic toxicity in 
cynomolgus monkeys, the no-observed -adverse -effect level ( NOAEL ) of 150 mg/kg/dose 
supports a 103-f old or 123 -fold safety margin by maximum observed concentration (C max) or 
area under the curve ( AUC )for the highest dose, 300 mg, of eptinezumab administered by IV 
infusion every 12 weeks in humans.
Overall, following IV administration in the nonclinical studies, eptinezumab exposure was 
generally dose proportional, and the plasma -concentration profiles were consistent for IV 
administration with the rapid achievement of C maxfollowed by a mono -exponential decline.

Study 19385A –Clinical Study Protocol Page 29of 98The volume of distribution (V c) for eptinezumab is generally limited to the vascular 
compartment.29
In conformance with applicable guidance documents, a complete package of 
reproductive/deve lopment toxicity studies were conducted. In these studies, administration of 
eptinezumab by IVinjection to pregnant female rats or rabbits at 75 or 150 mg/kg/dose was 
well tolerated. No effects on male or female reproductive function or performance, fertility or 
early embryonic development in rats were observed. No parental effects or evidence of 
embryo -lethality, fetotoxicity, or teratogenicity in rats or rabbits were observed.
The local tolerance of eptinezumab was assessed following multiple -dose studie s in rats and 
cynomolgus monkeys utilizing eptinezumab administered IV. No gross observations 
including erythema and oedema , or toxicologically significant histological changes at the 
injection site(s) were noted in either species for any dose route at con centrations up to 
100mg/mL eptinezumab.
Biologics in general have minimal risks regarding drug- drug interactions;30therefore, drug 
interactions with eptinezumab and concomitant medications are not expected, and nonclinical 
studies evaluating the potentia l for interactions with drugs that may be co- administered with 
eptinezumab were not performed.
1.1.3 Clinical Data
The clinical program of eptinezumab in migraine patients is composed of five completed 
studies to date; including two pivotal placebo -controlled studies (Phase III study in frequent 
episodic migraine [ALD403 -CLIN -
006],27and Phase III study in chronic migraine 
[ALD403 -CLIN -
011]).28A Phase III study (18903A)31has been conducted to assess 
treatment of eptinezumab in patients experiencing an acute attack of migraine.
A further global Phase I II placebo
-controlled study is initiated to evaluate the efficacy and 
safety of eptinezumab in patients with episodic cluster headache ( 19386A). This study is 
designed to demonstrate a statistically significant effect of eptinezumab on number of attacks 
during the cluster headache bout
.
Eptinezumab is admini stered by IV infusion, which bypasses extravascular absorption routes 
and renders 100% bioavailability. The time required to achieve therapeutic concentrations for 
eptinezumab is rapid and maximum observed C maxis typically observed at the end of infusion.
The low plasma clearance (0.15 L/d) and protracted terminal- elimination half -life (t ½) of 
27 days for eptinezumab support a sustained duration of effect and infrequent, once every 
12weeks dosing in migraine preventive treatment.
Eptinezumab is not metabo lized by cytochrome P450 enzymes. Therefore, interactions by 
eptinezumab with concomitant medications that are substrates, inducers, or inhibitors of 
cytochrome P450 enzymes are considered unlikely.32Nevertheless, the co- administration of 
eptinezumab in c ombination with sumatriptan was investigated in Study ALD403- CLIN001.29
The co -administration of sumatriptan did not appear to alter the single dose pharmacokinetic

Study 19385A –Clinical Study Protocol Page 30of 98(PK)of eptinezumab. Similarly, the PK of sumatriptan was not impacted upon by the 
co-administration of eptinezumab.
Results from the two pivotal, placebo -controlled, Phase III studie s showed that eptinezumab 
at doses of 100 mg or 300 mg administered by IV infusion every 12 weeks (2 infusions) led to 
significant reductions in monthly migraine days in patients with episodic or chronic migraine 
(ALD403 -CLIN -006 and AL D403 -CLIN -011).27,28Both eptinezumab 3 00 mg and 100 mg 
groups achieved the primary efficacy endpoint and all key secondary endpoints in the 
prespecified statistical hierarchy. The therapeutic benefit resulting from administration of 
eptinezumab for the preventive treatment of migraine in adult s is robust and clinically 
meaningful, as demonstrated by the results of the 75% and 50% migraine responder analyses. 
Administration of eptinezumab 100 or 300 mg resulted in a rapid, migraine preventive effect 
that was established on the day after the firs t infusion and maintained over the 12 -week 
dosing cycle. Both eptinezumab doses were associated with a consistent pattern of statistically 
significant and clinically meaningful efficacy across these endpoints compared with placebo.
The safety of eptinezumab has been evaluated in more than 2,400 subjects in doses up to 
1000 mg. Long- term data with eptinezumab is limited; however, in study ALD403 -CLIN -013 
a total of 100 patients have been treated with the 300 mg dose and completed the study at 
Week 104 and no new significant findings have been identified during the long- term 
follow -up.In patients with migraine, nasopharyngitis and hypersensitivity reactions, including
anaphylactic reactions, are considered adverse drug reactions for eptinezumab. In the pivotal 
Phase III studies (ALD403
-CLIN -006 and ALD403 -CLIN -011) hypersensitivity reactions 
were reported with multiple related adverse event terms, such as hypersensitiv ity, 
angioedema, urticaria, flushing/hot flush, rash and pruritus. These events were reported in 
approximately 4% of patients on 300 mg eptinezumab, 3% of patients on 100 mg 
eptinezumab and 1% of patients on placebo. Serious hypersensitivity reactions have been 
reported, including anaphylactic reactions on rare occasions. In most cases, the events 
developed during or within minutes of the infusion and subjects recovered following drug 
discontinuation and adequate treatment.
The safety findings to date indic ate that eptinezumab is well tolerated and demonstrates a 
favourable risk-benefit profile based on review of nonclinical, clinical, and scientific literature 
data.
1.2 Rationale for the Study
Cluster headache is an excruciatingly painful primary headache disorder, which places an 
exceptional burden on those affected. Few, if any, medical disorders are more painful than 
cluster headache . Patients describe the pain of a single attack as being worse than anything 
else they have experienced. The severity of the pai n has earned it the sobriquet “suicide 
headache”. Most patients w ith cluster headache have suicidal thoughts, but relatively little 
have self -harmful behaviour.33
There are significant unmet needs for just about every clinical aspect of the patient with 
cluster headache , particularly related to the severity of the disease and treatment options. Most

Study 19385A –Clinical Study Protocol Page 31of 98patients experiencing cluster headache attacks rate their pain intensity as near to or at the 
worst pain imaginable (using a VAS).9
Due to the high unmet need for new, effective, fast onset and better tolerated therapies for
cluster headache , Lundbeck is planning to conduct a study in order to evaluate the long -term 
treatment with eptinezumab in patients with cluster headache .The study will evaluate, in an 
open -label design, the potential of eptinezumab to reduce the number of cluster headache 
attacks and severity of pain in a population of patients with cCH. The study will also provide 
supportive data to the ongoing Phase III study on the efficacy of eptinezumab in episodic 
cluster headache ( 19386A), to demonstrate that eptinezumab isa safe therapeutic option for 
cluster headache . The results from a Phase III study with galcanezumab in episodic cluster 
headache ,43and its approval by the US FDA in this indication, prove the principle that mAbs, 
targeting CGRP, can be beneficial in cluster headache . Thus eptinezumab, which has similar 
biological properties and a faster onset of action in patients with migraine, is considered a 
viable therapeutic option to alleviate the symptoms of the diseas e in patients with cluster 
headache .

Study 19385A –Clinical Study Protocol Page 34of 98This study will be conducted in compliance with the protocol, Good Clinical Practice ,35and 
applicable regulatory requirements.
An overview of the study design is presented in Panel 1.
The target population for this study is defined as patients with cCH, based on the IHS ICHD -
3 
classification,4with documented evidence of cCH prior to screening and confirmed via 
prospectively- collected information in the eDiary during the Screening Period.
The total study duration from the Screening Visit to the Safety Follow -up (SFU) Visit is 
approximately 60 weeks and includes Screening Period (4 weeks), Treatment Period 
(48weeks), and SFU Period (8 weeks).
Eligible patients will receive four infusions with eptinezumab 400 mg at 12 -week intervals at 
Day 0 (Visit 2), at the end of Weeks 12 (Visit 5), 24 (Visit 8) and 36 (Visit 11), administered 
as an IV infusion over 45 minutes (+15 minutes).
The SFU Visit will take place at Week 56 (Visit 15) that is 20 weeks (5 half -lives) after the 
last eptinezumab administration.
Patients who withdraw from the study, except for those who withdraw their consent, will be 
asked to attend a Withdrawal Visit as soon as possible and a further SFU Visit, scheduled 
20weeks (5 half -lives) after the last eptinezumab administration.
Patients who are withdrawn from the treatment will be gi ven the opportunity to remain in the 
study at the discretion of the investigator. Patients will be expected to attend all scheduled 
study visits and procedures except eptinezumab administration. If patients refuse, they will be 
asked to attend a Withdrawal Visit as soon as possible and a further SFU Visit, scheduled 20 
weeks (5 half -lives) after the last eptinezumab administration .
Eligibility will be assessed during the Screening Period and before the first administration of 
eptinezumab at Day 0 (Visit 2) as described in Panel 2.
The following visits will be site visits: Screening Visit at Week -4 (Visit 1), Investigational 
Medicinal Product (IMP) Visits at Weeks 0, 12, 24 and 36 (Visits 2, 5, 8 and 11), Completion 
Visit at Week 48 (Visit 14) and SFU Visit at Week 56 (Visit 15) o r Withdrawal Visit, if 
applicable. All other study visits will be phone contact visits.

3.2 Rationale for the Study Design
The current study is planned as fixed -dose, multiple infusions study with an open -label 
design. The duration of the Treatment Period is chosen to allow generation of long -term 
exposure safety and tolerability data in patients with cCH, upon multiple infusions with 
eptinezumab 400 mg . The duration of the Screening P
eriod is chosen to inform on the 
baseline disease activity in a pop ulation of patients with cCH who are managed according to 
the established standards of care.
The proposed study population are patients with cCH. Episodic cluster headache and cCH 
share common pathophysiology and overlapping clinical symptoms with the majo r 
differences between the two forms of cluster headache residing in the duration of the “active” 
and “remission” periods and, very important from a clinical point of view, patients with cCH 
have a very poor response to preventive medications.38The distinc tions in two separate forms 
is, in some cases, solely virtual as when exacerbations lengthen, remissions shorten or more 
clusters occur than usual, the sufferers might be switching from episodic to chronic cluster 
headache .39Unhealthy lifestyle factors like smoking, alcohol overuse and high body mass 
index (BMI) are common for patients with episodic cluster headache and cCH and several

Study 19385A –Clinical Study Protocol Page 36of 98lifestyle related diseases like metabolic disease, gastric ulcer, menstrual diseases in women 
and visual disorders are bei ng more frequently reported in cCH than in episodic cluster 
headache .40Therefore 1 -year exposure to eptinezumab of patients with cCH, is considered an 
acceptable conservative approach to generate safety and tolerability data to adequately 
support the data , generated in the ongoing Phase III study in episodic cluster headache
sufferers (19386A) . In addition, the patients with cCH are the patient population, in need for 
long-term treatment to alleviate the symptoms of cluster headache .
Asthe current study w ill provide long -term safety data to support data from the ongoing 
Phase III study in episodic cluster headache sufferers ( 19386A), the same dose of 400 mg 
eptinezumab will be administered in both studies. This dose has been selected based on the 
fact that cluster headache patients have higher CGRP levels compared to migraine patients 
and healthy controls24, and a higher frequency of attacks compared to patients with migraine, 
suggesting that a higher dose of eptinezumab compared to the dose(s) approved for migraine 
prevention, is needed to allev iate features of the disease, related to the CGRP pathobiology. 
This together with PK and safety data from the completed Phase I studies in the migraine 
program,29in which eptinezumab was dosed up to 1000 mg and without any major safety 
findings, support that eptinezumab 400 mg can be safely used in the current study. This is in 
line with the dose considerations in the galcanezumab study in episodic cluster headache43
which investigated the efficacy and safety of a dose which is almost three -folds the 
galcanezumab dose recommended for the treatment of migraine .41, 42
Fulfilment of criteria for cCH, according to the eligibility criteria in this protocol, will be 
confirmed via prospectively collected information in the eDiary during the screening period ,
that is CHattack frequency of minimum 14 CHattacks for the 28 -dayScreening Period . The 
lower limit for CHattack frequency is in line with t he IHS ICHD -3 criteria for CH. Clinical 
site staff will be given access to the eDiary data .Prior to enrolment , the investigator will 
review the data in the eDiary Eligibility Repo rt to determine if the eligibility criteria are 
fulfilled.
Due to the high dose administered, the infusion time of eptinezumab is increased to 
45minutes in order to minimize the potential risk of hypersensitivity reactions associated 
with biologics.44
All patients will receive four infusions of eptinezumab 400 mg at 12 -week intervals. Given 
the eptinezumab half -life and proven efficacy over 12 weeks in migraineurs, it is considered 
that all patients will be exposed to eptinezumab for a period of approximately 1 year. 
Abortive and preventive treatments, as well as transitional therapies are allowed , or allowed 
with restrictions, during t he study, hence no patient will be denied access to standard 
treatments.
The sample size is chosen to support assessment of the safety and tolerability of long -term 
exposure to eptinezumab in patients with cluster headache . The number of patients treated 
will ensure that a sufficient number of patients will have been treated for 1 year, so the 
long-term exposure safety and tolerability of eptinezumab 400 mg can be assessed.1

Study 19385A –Clinical Study Protocol Page 37of 98The mean change from baseline in the number of cluster headache attacks is included to 
assess whether a symptom reduction is seen. This matches the primary endpoint from the 
ongoing placebo- controlled study in episodic cluster heada che(19386A), which is the change 
from baseline in number of weekly attacks (Weeks 1 –2), evaluated at Week 2 . Secondary 
endpoints evaluating sleep disturbances, health- related quality of life, as well as work 
productivity, are included in the study to evaluate the treatment effect beyond the reduction in 
number of cluster headache attacks.
Blood sampling will be required at several time points during the study to evaluate standard 
safety laboratory parameters, ADA including NAbs.
3.3 Benefit -Risk Assessment
Benefits
It has been shown that mAbs targeting CGRP provide clinical benefit in patients with episodic 
cluster headache.43Therefore, eptinezumab, which is also a mAb targeting CGRP with 
documented fast onset of action in patients in need of preventive treatment for migraine, is 
considered a viable therapeutic option to provide a fast reduction in the number of clu ster 
headache attacks in patients with cCH. The intravenous formulation offers a route of 
administration with 100% bioavailability that allows for rapid CGRP inhibition.
Risks
No safety data, specific to the use of eptinezumab in patients with cluster head ache is 
available. However, the safety of eptinezumab has been investigated in over 2,400 healthy 
subjects and patients with migraine at doses up to 1000 mg and the analyses show that 
eptinezumab is safe and well tolerated (see the current version of the Investigator’s 
Brochure29for more detailed information) . No important identified risks or important 
potential risks that could alter the benefit -risk profile of eptinezumab have been identified to 
date. Nasopharyngitis and hypersensitivity reactions , including anaphylactic reactions, are 
considered adverse reactions for eptinezumab. In the pivotal studies in migraine, 
hypersensitivity reactions were reported with multiple related adverse event terms, such as 
hypersensitivity, angioedema, urticaria, flushing/hot flush, rash and pruritus. Most 
hypersensitivity reactions occurred during the infusion and were not serious. Serious 
hypersensitivit y reactions have been reported, including anaphylactic reactions on rare 
occasions. In all cases, the patients recovered upon standard of care treatment.
With regard to the safety of the eptinezumab 400 mg dose, the safety of eptinezumab in 
patients with m igraine and in healthy subjects has been explored at doses up to 1000 mg, with 
no observable difference in the safety profile compared to the eptinezumab 100 mg and 
300mg doses, which are the doses approved by the US FDA and in Canada for preventive 
treatment of migraine. In addition, the treatment effect and safety of eptinezumab 400 mg is 
currently being investigated in patients with episodic cluster headache in an ongoing pivotal 
study (19386A).

Study 19385A –Clinical Study Protocol Page 38of 98The safety of study subjects is monitored throughout the s tudy via periodic collection of 
adverse events, vital signs, laboratory tests, ECGs and other safety assessments such as 
evaluation of the suicidality (C -SSRS). Although there was no evidence of impact of ADA 
development on efficacy or safety in any of the previous clinical studies, in the current study 
blood sampling for ADA including NAbs will be assessed prior to the first eptinezumab 
infusion, at Weeks 12, 24, 36, 48 and 56 (Safety Follow-up) , and at Withdrawal Visit when 
applicable . To monitor patient safety, safety data will be reviewed on an ongoing basis and 
evaluated regularly by the Lundbeck Safety Committee . This will ensure that prompt actions 
are taken, if needed.
Risk -mitigation
Based on the biological plausibility and the inherent risk, hypers ensitivity reactions are 
possible with any infused protein.44In order to minimize the risk of hypersensitivity reactions 
due to the higher dose of eptinezumab (400 mg considered justified in patients with cluster 
headache based on the higher CGRP levels) compared to doses used in migraine (100 mg or 
300 mg), the minimum duration of the eptinezumab infusion must be 45 minutes 
(45+ 15 minutes, according to the study protocol).
Furthermore, eptinezumab is administered in a clinical facility at the study site under medical 
supervision with appropriate measures for adequate treatment in place. Per protocol, patients 
are required to be monitored during the infusion and for a period of 1 hour from the 
end-of-infusion. Patients will be requested to stay longer should the investigator determine 
this is clinically warranted.
In addition to the above, the following risk mitigations are also taken for hypersensitivity 
reactions:
History of severe drug allergy or hypersensitivity or known hypersensitivity to 
IMP/excipients is an exclusion criterion.
Serious/severe hypersensitivity is a criterion for withdrawal from treatment.
In the context of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19), Lundbeck and the CRO will 
continue to follow each participating country’s guidance for t ravel, social distancing, 
minimum number of people in an indoor location at any time, personal protective equipment, 
and remote consenting procedures. Should further restrictions be imposed in any country that 
could impact patients’ ability to attend visit s, and/or clinical site staff’s ability to continue to 
resource the study to an adequate level, Lundbeck and the CRO will adapt their approach to 
patient enrolment and return visits. These mitigations will include, but not limited to:
Including a home nurs ing vendor to ensure the continuation of IMP Visits, including 
eptinezumab administration and post -infusion monitoring (if logistically possible and 
acceptable by the country -specific law). The administration via the home nursing vendor 
will have the same medical supervision and equipment/treatment in place needed to ensure 
patient’s safety as similar to the clinical facility at the study site.
Risk assessment (per country or site level) of enrolling new patients.

Study 19385A –Clinical Study Protocol Page 39of 98Benefit -Risk Assessment
Cluster headache is an excruciatingly painful primary headache disorder, which places an 
exceptional burden on those affected. There are significant unmet needs for the patient with 
cluster headache, particularly related to the severity of the disease and the lack of available 
fast onset, and better tolerated therapies.
The safety of eptinezumab, as investigated in patients with migraine and in healthy 
volunteers, shows that eptinezumab is safe and well tolerated. The risks for study subjects are 
further mitigated by measures in the protocol and safety monitoring of study subjects 
throughout the study.
H. Lundbeck A/S considers the benefit -risk profile of Study 19385A to be acceptable based 
on the nonclinical and clinical data for eptinezumab.
4Ethics
4.1 Ethical Rationa le
This study will evaluate the long -term safety and tolerability of eptinezumab in patients with 
cCH.
The dose of 400 mg eptinezumab is selected, based on the fact that cluster headache patients 
have higher CGRP levels compared to migraine patients and he althy controls24, suggesting 
that a higher dose of eptinezumab is needed to alleviate features of the disease, related to the 
CGRP pathobiology. The published results of the galcanezumab study in episodic cluster 
headache43which investigated the efficacy and safety of a dose, higher, compared to the 
approved galcanezumab dose for the treatment of migraine do not suggest any safety concerns 
and provide further support for the dose selection.41, 42
The patients will be fully informed about the study, including the risks and ben efits of their 
participation in the study.
The patient may withdraw from the study at any time, for any reason, specified or unspecified 
and without penalty or loss of benefits to which the patient is otherwise entitled. Unscheduled 
visits can be made, and immediate withdrawal is possible. Throughout the study, signs of 
suicidal risk will be assessed and the patients at risk will be withdrawn from the study.
In general, safety data with eptinezumab have not raised any clinical safety concerns from the 
compl eted Phase III studies in migraine. However, it cannot be ruled out that eptinezumab
could have adverse effects that have not yet been reported. Blood sampling will be required at 
several time points during the study to evaluate standard safety laboratory parameters. 
Although there was no evidence of impact of ADA development on efficacy or safety in any 
of the previous clinical studies, in the current study the ADA response will be assessed prior 
to the first eptinezumab infusion and
, at Weeks 12, 24, 36, 48 and 56 (SFU), and at 
Withdrawal Visit when applicable .

Study 19385A –Clinical Study Protocol Page 40of 98The risks associated with this study are considered adequately elucidated in the nonclinical 
and clinical studies, well controlled by cautionary measures in the study design, and 
well-balanced with the potential benefits of the treatment with eptinezumab, a potentially safe 
and effective treatment for episodic cluster headache .
In accordance with Good Clinical Practice ,35qualified medical personnel at Lundbeck or the 
CRO will be readily available to advise on study -related medical questions. Medical 
monitoring will be performed throughout the study. Safety da ta will be reviewed regularly by 
the Lundbeck Safety Committee to ensure that prompt action is taken, if needed.
In accordance with Good Clinical Practice ,35the investigator will be responsible for all 
study -related medical decisions.
Information on race will be collected, if allowed according to the country -specific law. 
Collecting information on race will allow the evaluation of treatment effects including safety 
evaluations in the overall population as well as investigations of the potential impact of

Risks Related to the Coronavirus Disease 2019
Lundbeck and the CRO have performed a review of the protocol, the participant population, 
and study design and conclude that the risks with regards to theCOVID -19 are minimized 
both for patients participating in the study and clinical site staff conducting the study in line 
with the US FDA and EMA guidances .36, 37The risks for the patients remain well controlled 
and balanced with the potential benefits of the treatment. This is based on the foll owing:
Patients participating in the clinical study will not attend visits in an area of the hospital 
that would be high risk for COVID -19 patients to be treated or seen.
The protocol has flexibility for re -screening and Screening Period extension to further 
enable sites and patients to continue the study in case of quarantine or lockdowns.
Patient visits to site will be limited to seven onsite visits over a time span of 60 weeks and 
all further contact will be conducted by phone. 
In exceptional situations to be approved by 
the CRO ’s medical monitor, site visits may only consist of blood and urine sampling ( for 
clinical safety laboratory tests, exploratory eptinezumab quant ification, ADA including 
NAb, and exploratory biomarkers) , ECG, vital signs, physical and neurological 
examinations, adverse events recording, and eptinezumab administration, while the 
remaining assessments (eDiary, ePROs, C-SSRS, and investigator evaluati ons) can be 
conducted remotely via a virtual clinic visit. Consequently, this reduces the burden on the 
clinical site to manage recurring visits around the potential restrictions for number of 
people allowed on site at any one time.
Study allows the flexib ility at Screening Visit to allow for review and signature of 
Informed Consent Form (s)via virtual clinic visit and Screening Visit assessments may be 
extended over several days, if needed. For other visits, patients are allowed to complete 
eDiary and ePRO s in the remote setting ( that is , at home), thus reducing the time that the 
patient needs to spend on site and minimizing burden for clinical site staff at a given visit.

Study 19385A –Clinical Study Protocol Page 41of 98The percentage of onsite targeted source data verification required for the study is 
approximately 30%, which, along with the number of visits for this study, substantially 
decreases the amount of time clinical research associates (CRAs) are expected to spend on 
site. Further, re mote source data verification is allowed in some cases as described in 
section 12.
Lundbeck and the CRO will continue to follow each participating country’s guidance for 
travel, social distancing, minimum number of people in an indoor location at any time, 
personal protective equipment , and remote consenting procedures
. Should further restrictions 
be imposed in any country that could impact patients’ and CRAs’ ability to attend visits, 
and/or clinical site staff’s ability to continue to resource the study to an adequate level, 
Lundbeck and the CRO will adapt their appro ach to patient enrolment, return visits and data 
monitoring by CRAs. These mitigations will include, but not limited to:
Including a home nursing vendor to ensure the continuation of IMP Visits (if logistically

An adaptation of the onsite data monito ring scheme to increase remote monitoring and 
consideration of remote source data verification.
Risk assessment (per country or site level) of enrolling new patients.
Any adaptations to the already approved protocol procedures and monitoring approach will be 
implemented in in line with the US FDA and EMA guidances.36, 37
Lundbeck and the CRO will assess on a site -by-site basis whether restrictions, e ither at a 
country or site level, would mean it would not be within the best interest of the potential 
patient or the clinical site staff to activate the clinical site at a particular time point. This 
would be based on, but not limited to, the following:
Country/area lockdowns.
A site’s ability to undertake non -essential clinic visits.
A site’s ability to adequately resource the study.
CRO -implemented restrictions for employee safety for travel and onsite visits.
4.2 Informed Consent

the investigator has obtained written informed consent from the patient.
It is the responsibility of the investigator ,or person designated by the investigator, to obtain
written informed consent from the patient . If the informed consent process may be delegated, 
the requirements for the delegates must be documented prior to the start of the study. National 
laws must always be adhered to when allowing potential delegation. Any delegation must be

provided remotely in line with the US FDA and EMA guidances.36, 37According to the EMA 
guidance, this could comprise contacting the patients via phone or video -calls and obtaining 
oral consents, to be documented in the patients' medical records, supplemented with email 
confirmation. Any consent obtained this way should be documented and confirmed by way of 
normal consent procedures at the earliest opportunity when the patients are back at the clinical 
sites.37
Re-screening of the Screening Visit is allowed under certain circumstances. Refer to 
section 8.2.3 .
The investigator must identify vulnerable patients, that is, patients whose willingness to 
participate in this study might be unduly influenced by the expectation, regardless of whether 
it isjustified, of benefits associated with participation, or of a retaliatory response from senior 
members of a hierarchy in case of refusal to participate. Patients thus identified must be 
excluded from participation in the study. Vulnerable patients include pregnant and 
breastfeeding women, minors, patients that cannot read and understand the Informed Consent 
Form(s) , patients hospitalised without consent or deprived of liberty due to legal or 
administrative decision, as well as patients under legal guardian ship and unable to provide 
their consent.
Prior to obtaining written informed consent, the investigator or a designee must explain to the 
patients the aims andmethods of the study and any reasonably expected benefits and 
foreseeable risks or inconvenience s to the patients.
The patients must be informed:
that their participation in the study is voluntary and that they are free to withdraw from the 
study at any time without justifying their decision ;
of the possibility of withdrawing consent (section 8.7);
of the possibility to remain in the study even after treatment withdrawal (that is to attend 
all visits and perform all procedures ex cept eptinezumab administration) ;
of their right to request a copy of their personal data from the study via the investigator ;
of their right to receive information about the study results from the investigator on the

A patient must be withdrawn from the study if:
the patient withdraws his or h er consent (defined as a patient who explicitly takes back his 
or her consent) ; section 8.7states how the patient’s data will be handled;
the patient has been enrolled in error;†
the patient fails to comply with study procedures;
the patient is lost to follow -up (defined as a pati ent who fails to comply with scheduled 
study visits or contact, who has not actively withdrawn from the study, and for whom no 
alternative contact information is available [this implies that at least two documented 
attempts have been made to contact the pa tient]);
the patient is at significant risk of suicide (defined as answering "yes" to suicidal ideation 
questions 4 or 5 or answering "yes" to suicidal behaviour on the C -SSRS at any time 
during the study.
A patient must be withdrawn from treatment if:
the investigator considers it, for safety , lack of efficacy, and/or study compliance reasons, 
in the best interests of the patient that he or she be withdrawn from treatment;
the patient becomes pregnant;
the patient has a serum ALT or AST value >3 times t he upper limit of the reference range 
and a serum total bilirubin value >2 times the upper limit of the reference range;
the patient has a serum ALT or AST value >5 times the upper limit of the reference range 
that is confirmed by re -testing <2 weeks later ;
the patient has a QT cF interval >500 ms; the decision to withdraw the patient may be 
postponed until a repeat ECG is taken, if ECG is taken within 24 hours;
the patient experiences an anaphylactic reaction or another serious and/or severe 
hypersensitivit y reaction to the eptinezumab infusion, as assessed by the investigator. If the 
event occurs during the infusion, the infusion must be discontinued immediately.
Patients who withdraw will not be replaced.
†If patient has been enrolled in error and has not been administered eptinezumab , the patient must be 
withdrawn. Withdrawal of patients enrolled in error and who have received eptinezumab should be 
based on a case-by-case evaluation of the individual risk/benefit. The decision about the 
administration of the second dose of eptinezumab will be based on an individual risk/benefit 
assessment as judged by the investigator.

asked to attend a Withdrawal Visit as soon as possible and a further SFU Visit, scheduled 
20weeks (5 half -lives) after the last eptinezumab administration.
Patients who are withdrawn from the treatment will be given the opportunity to remain in the 
study at the discretion of the investigator. Patients will be expected to attend all scheduled 
study visits and procedures except eptinezumab administration. If patients refuse, they will be 
asked to attend a Withdrawal Visit as soon as possible and a further SFU Visit, scheduled 
20weeks (5 half -lives) after the last eptinezumab administration.
6.3 IMP, Formulation, and Strength
The IMP supplied by Lundbeck in this study is:
Eptinezumab 100 mg/mL (1mL/vial) as concentrate for s olution for infusion.
400 mg eptinezumab will be dispensed as 4 vials of 100 mg/mL (1mL/ vial), concentrate for 
solution for infusion. 4 x 1 mL of 100 mg/mL concentrate for solution for infusion is added to 
100 mL of 0.9% normal saline, intravenously.
Doses will be administered intravenously over a period of 45 (+15) minutes by the 
investigator or designee.
If the infusion is not completed or temporarily interrupted, the reason for the interruption 
must be recorded in the electronic case report form (eCRF) and in the patient’s medical 
records . If theinvestigator stops or pauses the infusion due to a potential safety or tolerability 
issue, an Adverse Event should be recorded.
Further instructions on preparation and procedures associated wi th administering the IV can 
be found in the Pharmacy Manual and Infusion Guidelines .
6.4 Manufacturing, Packaging, Labelling, and Storage of IMP
The IMP will be manufactured, packaged, labelled, released (by a qualified person [ QP]), and 
distributed in accorda nce with the principles of Good Manufacturing Practice , under the 
responsibility of Lundbeck.
The IMP will be provided in a patient kit containing 4 single -use vials (as a concentrate for 
solution for infusion).
The wording on the labels will be in accorda nce with Good Manufacturing Practice regarding 
labelling and national and/or local regulatory requirements. If additional information is to be 
added when the IMP is dispensed to the patients, this will be clearly stated on the labels, and 
the investigator will be instructed to do so.
No manipulation, repackaging, or relabelling of IMP is permitted after QP release by 
Lundbeck, unless a repackaging/relabelling agreement exists, and the documentation is

made.
The IMP will be identified using a unique kitIMP number.
The IMP must be stored in a safe and secure location, and in accordance with the storage 
conditions specified on the label.
6.5 Method of Assigning Patients to Treatment
Interactive response technology (IRT) will be used in this study. Each patient will be assigned 
a screening number by the IRT, and that number will be used to identify the patient 
throughout the study. Assignment of IMP will be carrie d out in the IRT. Further information 
can be found in the Pharmacy Manual .
6.6 IMP Accountability
IMP accountability is documented in the IRT.
The investigator and the pharmacist must agree to only dispense IMP to patients enrolled in 
the study. The investigat or or the pharmacist must maintain an adequate record of the receipt 
and distribution of the IMP. This record must be available for inspection at any time.
7Concomitant Medication
Concomitant medication is any medication other than eptinezumab that is taken during the 
study from up to 3months prior to the Screening Visit until the SFU Visit.
The concomitant medications that are disallowed or allowed with restrictions during the study 
are summari sed in Appendix II .
Abortive therapy for cluster headache is allowed for the entire duration of the study (refer to 
list of therapies in Appendix II ).Specific transitional and preventive treatments for c luster 
headache are allowed with restrictions (refer to list of therapies in Appendix II )
Details of all concomitant medication (prescription and ov er-the-counter) taken < 3months 
prior to the Screening Visit must be recorded in the eCRF at the first visit. Any changes 
(including reason for changes) in concomitant medication must be recorded at each 
subsequent visit.
For any concomitant medication for which the dose wasincreased due to worsening of a 
concurrent disorder after enrolment in the study, the worsening of the disorder must be 
recorded as an adverse event.
For any concomitant medication initiated due to a new disorder after enrolment in the study, 
the disorder must be recorded as an adverse event.

Study 19385A –Clinical Study Protocol Page 51of 98Use of Coronavirus Disease 2019 Vaccine
There is currently no data indicating that eptinezumab may interact with or impair the body´s 
immunological response to the COVID -19 vaccines. Hence, there ar e no indications for safety 
concerns of concomitant use of the COVID -19 vaccines with eptinezumab. As such, 
COVID -19 vaccination is allowed during the eptinezumab studies with the guidance measures 
as described below.
If possible, a time window of at least 14 days should be allowed between COVID -19 
vaccination and the Screening Visit. If the patient has recently received a COVID- 19 vaccine, 
the investigator should judge if the patient can be administered eptinezumab inf usion at the 
scheduled visit based upon the patient’s individual response to the COVID -19 vaccine. As a 
precautionary measure, the COVID -19 vaccine should not be given within ±3 days of 
eptinezumab infusion.
In the current study, if a patient is administer ed a COVID -19 vaccine (or any other 
prophylactic vaccine or other concomitant medication), this should be captured as 
concomitant medication in the eCRF, including the date that the vaccine was given. The name 
of the manufacturer and, if applicable, whethe r it was the “first” or “last” vaccination should 
also be added, in a bracket for example.
All adverse events, including those judged by the investigator to be related to the COVID -19 
vaccine, must be captured in the eCRF on the Adverse Event Form . A causa lity assessment, 
including an alternative causality as relevant, must be provided on the Adverse Event Form .
8Study Visit Plan
8.1 Overview
An overview of the procedures and assessments to be conducted during the study and their 
timing is presented in Panel 2. Further details are in section 9.
The study consists of a Screening Period (4 weeks), a Treatment Period (48 weeks), and a 
Safety Follow -up Period (8 weeks). After the Screening Period, the patient will attend the 
Baseline Visit (Day 0/Visit 2), which is the first visit of the Treatment Period. All patients 
will receive four IVinfusions with eptinezumab 400 mg administered at
12-week intervals at 
Day 0 (Visit 2), at the end of Weeks 12 (Visit 5), 24 (Visit 8) and 36 (Visit 11) . For all 
patient s, who complete the study, a SFU Visit will be conducted 20 weeks (5 half -lives) after 
the last infusion of eptinezumab, that is at Week 56. For patient s who withdraw from the 
study ,the SFU Visit will be conducted 20 weeks (5 half -lives) after their last eptinezumab 
infusion
.
The following visits will be site visits:
Screening Visit at Week -4(Visit 1)
Baseline Visit at Week 0 (Day 0/Visit 2) –first eptinezumab infusion

eptinezumab infusion)
Completion Visit at Week 48 (Visit 14)
SFU Visit at Week 56(Visit 1 5)
Withdrawal Visit (if applicable) 
-Patients who withdraw, except for those who withdraw 
their consent, will be asked to attend a Withdrawal Visit as soon as possible and a further 
SFU Visit, scheduled 20 weeks (5 half -lives) after the last eptinezumab administration.
All other study visits will be phone contact visits.
Patients will be given an eDiary at the Screening Visit (Visit 1, Week -4)and must be trained 
by the clinical site staff in its use and compliance requirements. Patients will complete eDiary 
entries daily during the Screening Period (from Week -4 to Day 0) and during the first 4 
weeks that follow each eptinezumab infusion (Weeks 1 to 4, 13 to 16, 25 to 28, and 37 to 40) , 
and weekly for Weeks 5 to 12, 17 to 24, 29 to 36, and 41 to 48 .Patients must complete the 
daily eDiary and ePRO entries prior to infusion and prior to any interaction with the clinical 
site staff . At each clinic visit and phone contact, a compliance check of the eDiary data will be 
conducted by the clinical site staff. In addition to the eDiary compliance checks per formed at 
the defined study visits, ongoing evaluation of eDiary compliance will be performed by the 
clinical site (based on eDiary reporting) and more frequent contact with patients may be 
performed in case of non -compliance.
If the date of a clinic visit or phone contact does not conform to the schedule, subsequent 
visits should be planned to maintain the visit schedule relative to the Baseline Visit 
(Day 0/Visit 2).
In exceptional situations to be approved by the CRO ’s medical monitor, site visits may on ly 
consist of blood and urine sampling ( for clinical safety laboratory tests, exploratory
eptinezumab quantification, ADA including NAb, and exploratory biomarkers) , ECG, vital 
signs, physical and neurological examinations, adverse events recording, and ep tinezumab 
administration, while the remaining assessments (eDiary, ePROs, C
-SSRS, and investigator 
evaluations) can be conducted remotely as virtual clinic visits in line with the US FDA and 
EMA guidances .36, 37
During the Treatment Period, ePROs which are scheduled in alignment with a clinic visit can
be completed in the clinic or in the remote setting within 3daysprior to the scheduled visit 
date. ePROs which are scheduled in alignment with a phone contact must be completed in the 
remote setting and can be completed on the day or within 3daysprior to the scheduled phone 
contact date.
After completing or withdrawing from the study, the patient must be treated in accordance 
with usual clinical practice.

Study 19385A –Clinical Study Protocol Page 53of 988.2 Screening Visit (Visit 1)
Signed informed consent must be in place before any study -related assessments are performed 
and may be obtained at the Screening Visit.
At the Screening Visit, the patient will be asked to sign the main Informed Consent Form and 
theInformed Consent Form for blood sampling for pharmacogenet ics (optional). Depending 
of the country requirements, the number of ICFs may be different. Under exceptional 
circumstances, the discussion with the patients about the Informed Consent Form (s)can be 
done as a virtual clinic visit and the Informed Consent Form(s) can be provided remotely in 
line with the US FDA and EMA guidances .36, 37According to EMA guidance, this could 
comprise contacting the patients via phone or video -calls and obtaining oral consents, to be 
documented in the patients' medical records, supplemented wit h email confirmation. Any 
consent obtained this way should be documented and confirmed by way of normal consent 
procedures at the earliest opportunity when the patients are back at the clinical sites.37
After the Screening Visit ,a review of the data is required by the CRO medical monitor prior 
to the Baseline Visit (Day 0/Visit 2), to advise if the patient appears eligible and 
recommended to continue with the study procedures .
Re-screening for the Screening Visit is allowed according to criteria outlined in section 8.2.3.
For women of childbearing potential, a pregnancy test must be performed at the Screening 
Visit using serum beta -human chorionic gonadotropin (β -
hCG). The investigator must check 
and document current contraceptive methods. If relevant to do so, contraceptive therapy 
should be initiated if agreed by the patient and if there are no contraindications for the 
initiation of contraception.
At the Screening Visit, the patient willbe assisted with the provisi oning and training of the 
eDiary and ePROs by the clinical site staff . Details will be provided in a separate user manual. 
See section 9.2.1.2 for fu rther details on eDiary.
The Screening Visit assessments may be extended over several days if needed. The date of the 
first assessment (except Informed Consent Form ) should be entered in eCRF as the visit date.
In this case, eDiary must be provided to the patient on the date of that first assessment, which 
is considered as the first day of the 28 -day Screening Period.
8.2.1 Pre-
Screening
Each site must record in a pre-screening log which patients attended the Screening Visit.
8.2.2 Patient Identification Card
Each patient will be provided with a patient identification card that states, at a minimum, the 
name of the IMP, the study number, the patient identification number, the investigator’s 
name, and an emergency telephone number providing 24 -hour service.

8.2.3 Re-Screening Visit
The Re -Screening Visit must be conducted as a visit to the clinical site. Re-screening is only 
allowed for patients with a complete Screening Visit and who fail to meet one or more of the 
following selection criteria:
1.If the diagnosis of cCH as defined by IHS ICHD -3 classification4cannot be confirmed 
due to disease duration of less than 12 months during the maximum duration of the 
Screening Period, including the potential 1 -week extension of this period granted by 
the CRO ’smedical monitor (Inclusion criterion N° 8).
2.
If the patient does not have during the Screening Period, based on prospectively -collected 
information in the eDiary, a cluster headache attack frequency of minimum 14 cluster 
headache attacks for the 28 -day Scre ening Period (Inclusion criterion N°10).
3. If the patient has demonstrated poor compliance with the eDiary during the maximum 
duration of the Screening Period, including the potential 1 -week extension of this 
period granted by the CRO ’s medical monitor, due to well documented reasons 
(sickness, travels, technical eDiary issues ,or others) (Inclusion criterion N°11).
4. If the patient does not fulfil Exclusion criterion N°3 (previous participation in a clinical 
study <30 days or has taken any investigational products within 5 plasma half -lives 
(whichever is longer) prior to the Screening Visit.
5.If the patient does not fulfil Exclusion criterion N°1 8(Disallowed medications or 
medications allowed with restrictions), refer to Appendix II :
The required duration of a washout period for a medication t hat is disallowed prior to 
screening, or,
A stable usage period for a medication that is allowed with restrictions prior to 
screening.
The patient must already have either started the washout prior to screening or be on the 
allowed dosage as part of their standard clinical care. Washout or change in dosage may 
not be done specifically for inclusion into this study, but only if clinically indicated.
6.Patients with uncontrolled high blood pressure at the Screening Visit (Exclusion criteria 
N°16 and 19): may be considered for re -screen once their blood pressure is controlled in 
the opinion of the investigator; any use of antihypertensive medication and dose must be 
stable for at least 2 months prior to the Re-Screening Visit.
7.Patients with a BMI ≥39 kg/m2(Exclu sion criterion N°20).
8.A patient has answered "yes" to suicidal ideation questions 4 or 5 of the C
-SSRS or "yes" 
to suicidal behaviour within the past month (Exclusion criterion N°24) . These screen- fail 
patients may be considered for re -screen if the following conditions are met:
The patient was referred to an appropriate mental health professional and received 
treatment.
At least 6 months has elapsed since the screen- fail.

investigator to be at significant risk for suicide.
9.For patients affected by COVID -19during the Screening Period, that is being in 
quarantine with a positive COV ID-19 test with or without symptoms or other reasons 
related to COVID -19 which impacts the patients study participation, there will be an 
option of re -screening upon approval from the CRO ’s medical monitor .
At the new Screening Visit, the patient must sign new Informed Consent Form (s). At the new 
Screening Visit, the patient will be assigned a new screening number. A re -screened patient 
must have a complete new Screening Visit, and all the eligibility criteri a must be re -assessed 
at the new Screening Visit.
The decision and the planning for re -screening must be based on a discussion between 
patients and investigators . Due to the short enrolment period, re-screening will only be 
possible if the study is still e nrolling patients. Authorisation for re- screening may only be 
granted by the CRO ’s medical monitor after a thorough review of all data from the original 
Screening Visit.
The following information will also be recorded in the eCRF at the new Screening Visit :
that the patient has previously been screened for the study ;
that re -screening has been authori sed by the CRO ’s medical monitor;
the screening number that was assigned to the patient at the original Screening Visit .
If a patient is re -screened, no data f rom the original Screening Visit will be used.
A patient may only be re -screened once.
8.2.4 Extension of Screening Period
Extension of the Screening Period is only allowed for patients with a complete Screening 
Visit and who fail to meet one or more of the following selection criteria:
1. If the patient does not have during the Screening Period, based on prospectively collected 
information in the eDiary, a cluster headache attack frequency of minimum 14 cluster 
headache attacks for the 28 -day Screening Period ( Inclusion criterion N°10).
2.If the patient has demonstrated poor compliance with the eDiary during the 4 -week

8.3 Baseline Visit (Day 0/Visit 2) + IMP infusion
The Baseline Visit (Day 0/Visit 2) also includes eptinezumab administration and will occur 4 
weeks after the Screening Visit. Inclusion and exclusion criteria review must be done prior to
dosing at the Baseline Visit (Day 0/Visit 2).
Ablood sample for pharmacogenetics (optional) shall be taken prior to eptinezumab infusion.
For procedures preceding and following eptinezumab administration, see section 8.4.
8.4 IMP Visit s (Visits 2, 5, 8 and 11) + IMP infusion
At IMP Visits, the patients will receive an eptinezumab infusion. See section 6.1and Infusion 
Guidelines for further instructions on procedures associated with administering IV 
eptinezumab .
eDiary and ePRO must be completed prior toinfusion and prior to any interaction with the

Blood samples for biobanking ( gene expression profiling, and metabolomics/proteomics ) 
shall be drawn prior to the first and the third eptinezumab infusion at Visits 2 and 8.
Patients will be requested to stay longer should the investigator or designee determine this is 
clinically warranted. After the infusion, the patients will be under observation, but not 
confined to bed, unless the investigator decides, based on the patient’s condition, that it is in 
the best interest of the patient to be confined to bed.
8.5 Phone Contacts (Visits 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10, 12, 13)
The patient will be contacted via phone for eDiary compliance checks to ensure that selected 
ePROs assessments have been completed and for collection of relevant information such as 
adverse events and concomitant medication.
Acompliance check of eDiary data will be conducted by the clinical site staff and the patient 
will be assisted with re -training if necessary. In addition to the eDiary compliance checks 
performed at the defined study visits, ongoing evaluation of eDiary compliance will be 
performed by the clinical site (based on eDiary reporting) and more frequent conta ct with 
patients may be needed in the case of non- compliance. See section 9.2.1.2 for further details

remote setting and can be completed on the day or within 3 days prior to the scheduled pho ne 
contact date.
Only the clinical site staff trained and listed in the delegation log will conduct phone contacts 
and hence be allowed to call the patient. Each phone contact must be documented in medical 
notes and used for source data verification when c ompleting the eCRF and for subsequent 
monitoring.
Phone contacts should be planned to maintain the visit schedule relative to the Baseline Visit

At the Completion Visit, the patient must be assisted with the closeout of the eDiary.
Blood samples for biobanking (gene expression profiling, and metabolomics/proteomics) 
shall be drawn at the Completion Visit.
8.7 Withdrawal Visit
Three different scenarios c an occur , depending on whether the patients withdraw from the 
study, from treatment or withdraw their consent.
Patients who withdraw from the study prior to the Completion Visit (Week 48/Visit 14) , 
except for those who withdraw their consent, will be asked to atte nd a Withdrawal Visit as 
soon as possible and a further SFU Visit, scheduled 20 weeks (5 half -lives) after the last 
eptinezumab administration .
Patients who are withdrawn from the treatment prior to the Completion Visit (Week 48/Visit 
14) will be given the opportunity to remain in the study at the discretion of the investigator. 
Patients will be expected to attend all scheduled study visits and procedures except 
eptinezumab administration. If patients refuse , they will be asked to attend a Withdrawal Visit 
as soon as possible and a further SFU Visit, scheduled 20 weeks (5 half -lives) after the last 
eptinezumab administration.
No new information will be collected from patients who withdraw from the study or decide to 
withdraw , except information collected in relation to the scheduled Withdrawal Visit and SFU 
Visit or needed for the follow -up of adverse events (section 10.5).
The reason for withdrawal mus t be recorded in the eCRF , and the investigator must ask 
specifically whether withdrawal was due to an adverse event .
For a patient who withdraws consent:
if the patient withdraws consent during a site visit and then agrees to it being the final visit, 
the investigator will complete the visit as a Withdrawal Visit and all the data collected up 
to and including that visit will be used ;
if the patient withdraws consent during a telephone conversation, the investigator will ask 
the patient if he or s he will attend a Withdrawal Visit. If the patient:
agrees to attend a Withdrawal Visit, all the data collected up to and including that visit 
will be used ;
refuses to attend a Withdrawal Visit, the investigator should attempt to follow the 
patient’s safety and future treatment; any information collected will only be recorded in 
the patient’s medical records ;
if the patient explicitly requests that the patient’s data collected from the time of 
withdrawal of consent onwards not be used, this will be respected .

Study 19385A –Clinical Study Protocol Page 59of 988.8 Safety Follow -up Visi t (Visit 15)
The SFU Visit must be conducted as a visit to the clinical site. The SFU Visit should be 
conducted 20 weeks (5 half -lives) after the last eptinezumab administration.
The SFU Visit will be conducted to capture adverse eve ntsthat occur after the 
Completion/Withdrawal Visit, as well as to follow up on the outcome of adverse events 
ongoing at the Completion/Withdrawal Visit.
Patients who withdraw from the study , except for those who withdraw their consent, will be 
asked to a ttend a Withdrawal Visit as soon as possible after withdrawal, and a further SFU 
Visit, scheduled 20 weeks (5 half -lives) after the last eptinezumab administration.
For adverse events that were ongoing at the Completion/Withdrawal Visit and that resolved 
during the SFU Period, the stop date must be recorded. For non -serious adverse events still 
ongoing at the safety follow -up, the Ongoing Adverse Event checkbox on the Adverse Event 
Form must be ticked. Serious adverse events (SAEs) must be followed until re solution or the 
outcome is known.
The safety follow -up for patients who withdraw consent must be performed, if at all possible; 
any information collected will be recorded in the patients’ medical records.
8.9 Unscheduled Visit
Unscheduled visits can be completed if required as either site visit or telephone visits. At
these visits, clinical safety laboratory tests, ECG, vital signs, physical examination,
neurological examination , C-SSRS, body m easurement , mental health consultation
information or pregnan cy tests can be performed. In case of any additional tests performed not 
covered by the existing tests specified in the protocol and the eCRF, the results can be 
reported in connection with an AE reporting ( see section 10)or documented in the medical 
records, as applicable.

9.1.2 Diagnostic Assessments
IHS ICHD -3 guidelines4sections 3.1and 3.1. 2 for cCH are the diagnostic criteria to be used 
when assessing patient eligibility. Fulfilment of criteria for cCH according to the inclusion 
criteria in this protocol will be confirmed via prospectively- collected information in the 
eDiary during Screening Period , that is CHattack frequency of minimum 14 attacks during
the 28 -day Screening Period . The lower limit for CHattack frequency is in line with the 
IHS ICHD -3 criteria for CH. 
Definition of an eDiary Complian tDay: A Compliant Day is defined as any day where :
a headache event is reported 
orevening diary is completed confirming patient didnot have any new headache to report
Prior to enrolment , the investigator will review the data in the eDiary Eligibility Report to

episodic cluster headache (secondary cCH). In some patients change occurs from cCH to 
episodic cluster headache .4
9.1.3 Drug Screen
A urine drug screen will be performed at the central laboratory for the Screening Visit only. A 
positive result must be discussed with the CRO ’smedical monitor.
9.2 Efficacy Assessments
Efficacy assessments include the eDiary to record daily /weekly cluster headache data and 
ePROs (PGIC, SIS ).
Patients will record cluster headache data on an eDiary from the Screening Period (Visit 1, 
Week -4) until the Completion Visit (Week 48/Visit 14):
On a daily basis during the Screening Period (from Week -4 to D ay 0) and during the first 
4 weeks that follow each eptinezumab infusion (Weeks 1 to 4, 13 to 16, 25 to 28, and 37 to 
40);
On a weekly basis for Weeks 5 to 12, 17 to 24, 29 to 36, and 41 to 48.
Patients will complete the PGIC and SIS along with the pharmac oeconomic assessment 
ePROs (see section 9.3). It is preferable that the scheduled time of the day for the assessments 
is as consistent as possible acr oss all the study visits.
ePROs will be completed in alignment with clinic visits and phone contacts (see Panel 2):
ePROs which are scheduled in alignm ent with a clinic visit:
can be completed in the clinic or in the remote setting within 3daysprior to the 
scheduled clinic visit date. On the day of IMP Visit s(Day 0/Visit 2, Week 12/Visit 5, 
Week 24/Visit 8, and Week 36/Visit 11 ), patients must complete the ePROs prior to 
infusion and prior to any interaction with the clinical site staff .
ePROs which are scheduled in alignment with a phone contact :
must be completed in the remote setting and can be completed on the day or within

Study 19385A –Clinical Study Protocol Page 63of 98TheCOA tools will be administered in the local language. Only those provided by Lundbeck 
that have been validated in the language to which they have been translated will be used in 
this study.
The following COA tools will be used for efficacy assessments:
eDiary -to assess th e number of daily /weekly cluster headache attacks, pain severity and 
medication use ( that is the start and stop dates of cluster headache attacks and use of 
abortive cCH medications).
PGIC -to assess overall change in the severity of illness following tre atment.
SIS -to assess quality of life resulting from insomnia as caused by cluster headache
attacks .
9.2.1.2 eDiary
At the Screening Visit (or at the date of the first assessment if assessments are extended over 
several days) , the patient willbe assisted with t he provisioning of the eDiary and willbe 
trained in eDiary use and compliance requirements by designated clinical site staff . Patients 
will be instructed to complete the eDiary on a daily basis, during the Screening Period (from 
Week -4 to Day 0) and during the first 4 weeks that follow each eptinezumab infusion (Weeks 
1 to 4, 13 to 16, 25 to 28, and 37 to 40) , and on a weekly basis for Weeks 5 to 12, 17 to 24, 29 
to 36, and 41 to 48. The eDiary close outmust be performed while the patient is on site.
Details will be provided in a separate eDiary Training Module.
The content of the cluster headache diary is developed on key characteristics as mentioned in 
the definition of cCH (see section 9.1.2 ). The eDiary consists of applications and reports 
which will be used to derive the cluster headache endpoints and abortive medication use . The 
patient should record for each day /week if they experienced any c luster headache attacks. For 
each experienced cluster headache attack, the start date and time will be collected. The patient 
will record further daily /weekly information regarding the severity of pain associated to 
cluster headache and intake of cluster headache abortive medication. Cluster headache items 
will be assessed with a yes/no response; and severity of pain will be rated on an ordinal scale 
ranging fr om 0 to 4 (headache pain ratings: 0=none/barely any pain; 1=mild; 2=moderate; 
3=severe; 4=excruciating).48Additional details regarding the questions that patients will 
answer can be found in the eDiary Training Module .
The Screening Visit will correspond to the day of eDiary distribution and will start the 28-day 
eDiary Screening Period. Any patient found to be ineligible for the study during Screening 
Period will not be enrolled . An eDiary Eligibility Report will be used to review baseline 
cluster headach eattack days and eDiary compliance during the Screening Period for the 
eligibility assessment of:
a minimum 14 cluster headache attacks for the first 28days of Screening Period
compliance by entry of cluster headache data for at least 24out of the first28days of 
Screening Period .

Study 19385A –Clinical Study Protocol Page 64of 98On the Baseline Visit (Day 0/Visit 2), patients must ensure to complete eDiary recording of 
cluster headache attacks that ended prior to infusion ( that is for cluster headache attacks 
which are ongoing or not yet recorded in t he eDiary).
On each day during the first 4 weeks that follow each eptinezumab infusion, the patient will 
be asked to record eDiary data for the day. On Weeks 5 to 12, 17 to 24, 29 to 36, and 41 to 48 , 
anduntil the Completion Visit (Week 48/Visit 14)/Withd rawal Visit , the patient will be asked 
to record eDiary data for the week.
Clinical study s ite staff will be given access to the eDiary data. Compliance data (based on 
eDiary reporting) will be made available throughout the study to the clinical site staff for 
review on a regular basis. At least 24 out of the first 28days compliance is needed during the 
Screening Period. At each clinic visit and phone contact , a compliance check of eDiary will 
be conducted by the clinical site staff. Additionally, ongoing evaluation of eDiary compliance 
will be performed by the clinical site and more frequent contact with patients may be needed 
in case o f non -compliance. All follow -up with patients regarding eDiary compliance should 
be documented in the source records.
9.2.1.3 Patient Global Impression of Change
The PGIC is a single patient -reported item reflecting the patient’s impression of change in 
their dise ase status since the Baseline Visit (Day 0/Visit 2) (that is, in relation to activity 
limitations, symptoms, emotions, and overall quality of life). The item is rated on a 7 -point 
scale, where a high score indicate improvement (very much improved; much imp
roved; 
minimally improved; no change; minimally worse; much worse; very much worse). It takes 
approximate 1 minute to complete the scale.
9.2.1.4 Sleep Impact Scale
The SIS49is a patient -reported scale to assess quality of life resulting from sleep disturbance. 
The SIS questionnaire includes 35 items belonging to 7 domains to assess sleep impact on: 
daily activities (5 items); emotional well -being (4 items); emotional impact (4 items); 
energy/fatigue (5 items); social well
-being (6 items); mental fatigue (3 items) ; and satisfaction 
with sleep (8 items). Each item, for 6 out of the 7 domains, is rated on a 5- point scale ranging 
from 1 (“always” or “all of the time”) to 5 (“never” or “none of the time”), whereas 
satisfaction with sleep is rated on a 5 -point scale ran ging from 1 (very satisfied) to 5 (very 
dissatisfied). Each domain yields a score ranging from 0 to 100; items within each domain are 
summed and transformed using a formula . A higher score indicate sbetter quality of life 
(reverse scoring for the satisfact
ion with sleep domain). It takes approximately 10 minutes to 
complete the SIS.
9.2.1.5 External Clinical Outcome Assessments Monitoring Oversight

Study 19385A –Clinical Study Protocol Page 70of 98The investigator must review (initial and date) the res ults of the clinical safety laboratory tests 
as soon as possible after receipt of those results. Out-of- range values must be interpreted by 
the investigator as “not clinically significant” or “clinically significant” with a comment 
concerning the planned f ollow -up. Tests for clinically significant out -of-range values must be 
repeated, or an appropriate clinical follow -up must be arranged by the investigator and 
documented on the laboratory report, until the value has stabilized or until the value has 
return ed to a clinically acceptable value (regardless of relationship to the eptinezumab ). A 
patient with a value that is out -of-range at the Completion Visit (Week 48/Visit 14) or 
Withdrawal Visit and considered clinically significant must be followed in accordance with 
usual clinical practice . If the clinically significant out -of-range clinical safety laboratory test 
value has not normalized or stabilized or a diagnosis or a reasonable explanation has not been 
established by the SFU Visit, the investigator must decide whether further follow -up visits are 
required (this may include an additional medical examination and/or additional blood 
sampling). Any out -of-range values followed after the last protocol -specified contact with the 
patient will be documented in t he patient’s medical records.
9.6.3 Vital Signs
The investigator may appoint a designee (for example, nurse or paramedic) to measure vital 
signs, provided this is permitted according to local regulations. The investigator must take 
responsibility for reviewing t he findings.
Pulse rate and blood pressure will be measured using a standard digital meter. Pulse rate and 
blood pressure will be measured in the following order: supine, sitting, and standing after the 
patient has rested in each position for at least 3 minutes.
At IMP Visits, vital signs including body temperature will be assessed both prior to and after 
infusion. When coinciding, vital signs including body temperature must be assessed prior to 
blood sampling.
9.6.4 Height and Weight
The patient’s height will be measured once at the Screening Visit.
The patients will be weighed wearing light clothing and no shoes. A similar amount of 
clothing must be worn on each occasion. At IMP Visits, weight is assessed prior to infusion.
9.6.5 Electrocardiograms
A standard 12 -lead ECG will be recorded using digital ECG recording equipment provided to 
the investigator or, upon agreement, to an external cardiology centre. The ECGs will be 
transferred digitally to a central ECG laboratory for evaluation. The investigator will be 
provided with the results and a cardiological interpretation of the ECG fr om the central ECG 
laboratory.
The results from the central ECG laboratory will include the PR, QRS, QT, and QT cintervals.

administration. The investigator has the fina l decision on the interpretation of the ECG 
results.
9.6.6 Physical and Neurological Examinations
Physical and neurological examinations for all clinic visits after the Screening Visit willbe 
conducted at the discretion of the investigator. If these examination s are conducted at an IMP 
Visit, these must be performed prior to the infusion.
The investigator may appoint a designee to be primarily responsible for performing the 
physical and neurological examinations, such as physician assistant or nurse practitioner (as 
applicable), provided this is permitted according to local regulations. The investigator’s 
designee must be properly trained and have experience in performing these examinations. The 
investigator must take responsibility for revie wing the findings. Whenever possible, the same 
individual should perform all the physical examinations.
The physical examination must, at a minimum, include an examination of appearance, 
extremities, skin, head, neck, eyes, ears, nose, throat, lungs, chest , heart, abdomen (including 
the renal regions), and musculoskeletal system .
9.6.7 Columbia -Suicide Severity Rating Scale
The C -SSRS is a semi -structured interview developed to systematically assess suicidal 
ideation and behaviour of patients participating in a c linical study.52The C -SSRS has 
5questions addressing suicidal ideation, 5 sub -questions assessing the intensity of ideation, 
and 4 questions addressing suicidal behaviour. For this study, the following versions of the 
scale are used: the “Baseline/Screen ing” version (lifetime and 1 -month assessment) and the 
“Since last visit” version (for all subsequent visits). It takes approximately 5 to 10 minutes to 
administer and rate the C -SSRS.
The C -SSRS must be administered in the local language.
The C -SSRS is a paper and pencil measure that should only be administered by a qualified 
rater and the investigator review must be documented in the patient’s medical records .For 
each individual patient, the same certified rater should preferably rate the patient throughout 
the study. In case of unforeseen circumstances, certified back -up raters should be available 
throughout the study. Any exceptions must be discussed and approved by Lundbeck and/or its 
designee.
Rater training and certification will be conducted by the CRO as agreed with Lundbeck. 
Raters will complete their designated training curriculum based on their initial qualification 
status and assigned role. Only raters who qualify on study- specific Rater Certification 
Programme will be authori sed to admin ister the C -SSRS in the study. Documentation of 
training and certification will be provided to raters for archiving in the investigator site file 
and in the sponsor TMF. No patient must be rated before the documentation has been

9.6.8 Anti- Drug Antibody including Neutralizing Antibody Assessm ents
Blood samples for ADA, including NAb assessments (maximum total volume 15 mL), will be 
collected in accordance with Panel 2
.The blood sampling a nd handling procedures are 
described in the study- specific Laboratory Specification Manual .
The serum samples will be analysed by a contracted laboratory under the responsibility of 
Department of Bioanalysis - Biologics, H. Lundbeck A/S, according to a protocol approved 
by Lundbeck.
9.7 Biobanking
9.7.1 General Considerations
This study includes collection of blood samples for long- term storage and use in a possible 
future explorative research study, that may help to increase our understanding of the aetiology 
of neurological diseases, such as migraine and the molecular basis of the drug response.
Although the potential future exploratory analyses will help to increase our understanding of 
the aetiology of cCH and the molecular basis of the drug response, the effor ts described in this 
protocol are strictly research based. Therefore, as the complex interactions between genes and 
disease are currently not characterized to a level that translates to a meaningful clinical 
advantage, individual results from the exploratory analyses will not be given to either the 
study participants or the investigator . For the same reasons, individual results will not be 
added to the patients’ medical records.
The patients will have no direct benefit from the exploratory analyses.
To ensu re privacy protection, the blood samples for RNA gene expression profiling, 
proteomics/metabolomics analysis and future ADA assessments will be single -coded using 
the patient’s screening number. The blood samples for the pharmacogenetic biomarker 
analysis will be double -coded, that is one code key will be stored at the clinical site and the 
other at Lundbeck. To link a DNA sample to a specific subject, both code keys are needed.
The blood samples collected for the possible future exploratory analysis may be shared with 
academic and public institutions and other companies. However, Lundbeck will retain full 
control of the samples and their use in accordance with the information in the Patient 
Information Sheet and a Material Transfer Agreement . Furthermore, the results based on the 
analysis of the samples may be pooled across studies to increase the statistical power of the 
analyses.

10Adverse Events
10.1 Definitions
10.1.1 Adverse Event Definitions53
Adverse event –is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or cl inical study patient 
administered a medicinal product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship 
with this treatment.
An adverse event can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign (including clinically 
significant out -of-range value s from relevant tests, such as clinical safety laboratory tests, 
vital signs, ECGs), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal 
product, regardless of whether it is considered related to the medicinal product.
A worsening of a pr e-existing or chronic condition is considered an adverse event and must be 
reported as such. Medical conditions, which existed prior to the time of informed consent into 
the clinical study are part of the patient's medical history and are not considered an adverse 
event. Unchanged, chronic, non -worsening or pre -existing conditions from the time of 
informed consent are not adverse events and should not be reported as such.
Adverse events (serious and non- serious) must be collected, recorded, and reported to 
Lundbeck from the time the patient has signed the Informed Consent Form (s)at the Screening 
Visit until the Safety Follow -upVisit .

Study 19385A –Clinical Study Protocol Page 76of 98Serious adverse event –is any adverse event that:
results in death
is life -threatening (this refers to an event in which the patient was at risk of death at the 
time of the event; it does not refer to an event that hypothetically might have caused death 
had it been more severe)
requires inpatient hospitalisation or prolongation of existing hospitalis ation
results in pe rsistent or significant disability/incapacity
is a congenital anomaly/birth defect
is medically important (this refers to an event that may not be immediately life -threatening 
or result in death or hospitalis ation, but may jeopardize the patient or may req uire 
intervention to prevent any of the SAEs defined above)
Examples of medically important events are intensive treatment for allergic bronchospasm; 
blood dyscrasia or convulsions that do not result in hospitalis ation; or development of drug 
dependency or drug abuse.
Planned hospitali sations or surgical interventions for a condition that existed before the 
patient signed the Informed Consent Form (s)and that did not change in intensity are not 
adverse events. Emergency room visits that do not result in admission to the hospital are not 
necessarily SAEs; however, they must be evaluated to determine whether they meet any of the 
SAE definitions (for example, life -threatening or other serious [medically important] event) .
Non-serious adverse event –is any a dverse event that does not meet the definition of an SAE.
If there is any doubt as to whether an adverse event meets the definition of an SAE, a 
conservative viewpoint must be taken, and the adverse event must be reported as an SAE.
Suspected unexpected se rious adverse reaction (SUSAR) –is any adverse event that is 
assessed as serious, unexpected (its nature or intensity is not consistent with the current 
version of the Investigator’s Brochure29), and related to a medicinal pro duct by either the 
investigator or Lundbeck.
Overdose –is a dose received by a patient that exceeds the dose prescribed to that patient. 
Any overdose (and associated symptoms) m ust, at a minimum, be recorded as a non- serious 
adverse event.
10.1.2 Adverse Event Assessment Definitions
Assessment of Intensity
The investigator must assess the intensity of the adverse event using the following definitions, 
and record it on the Adverse Event Form :
Mild – the adverse event causes minimal discomfort and does not interfere in a significant 
manner with the patient’s normal activities.

Final
2.0
CLI_02068699
H. Lundbeck A/S
Confidential
Study 19385A –Clinical Study Protocol Page 77of 98Moderate – the adverse event is sufficiently uncomfortable to produce some impairment of 
the patient’s normal acti vities.
Severe –the adverse event is incapacitating, preventing the patient from participating in the 
patient’s normal activities.
Assessment of Causal Relationship
The investigator must assess the causal relationship between the adverse event and 
eptinezumab using the following definitions, and record it on the Adverse Event Form and the 
Serious Adverse Event Form (if applicable):
Probable –the adverse event has a strong temporal relationship to eptinezumab or recurs 
on rechallenge, and another aetiology is unlikely or significantly less likely.
Possible –the adverse event has a suggestive temporal relationship to eptinezumab , and an 
alternative aetiology is equally or less likely.
Not related –the adverse event has no temporal relationship to eptinezumab or is due to 
underlying/concurrent disorder or effect of another drug (that is, there is no causal 
relationship between eptinezumab and the adverse event).
An adverse event is considered causa lly related to the use of eptinezumab when the causality 
assessment is probable or possible .
Assessment of Outcome
The investigator must assess the outcome of the adverse event using the following definitions, 
and record it on the Adverse Event Form and th e Serious Adverse Event Form (if applicable):
Recovered –the patient has recovered completely, and no symptoms remain.
Recovering –the patient’s condition is improving, but symptoms still remain.
Recovered with sequelae – the patient has recovered, but some symptoms remain (for 
example, the patient had a stroke and is functioning normally, but has some motor 
impairment).
Not recove red –the patient’s condition has not improved, and the symptoms are 
unchanged (for example, an atrial fibrillation has become chronic).
Death .
10.1.3 Management of Reactions to Study Drug
There are no specific antidotes to an infusion of eptinezumab.
A medical e mergency should be treated appropriately by the investigator using proper 
standard of care, according to their typical clinical practice and local guidelines for that 
emergency condition.
Should a medical condition arise that the investigator believes is r elated to the study drug, 
clinical judg ement should be used to provide the appropriate response including the

reaction or another severe and/or serious hypersensitivit y reaction during eptinezumab
infusion, as assessed by the investigator, the infusion must be discontinued immediately (see 
section 6.2) and appropriate therapy instituted. Any events believed to be allergic reactions 
should be discussed with the medical monitor.
Theclinical site will have the possibility to collect, at the time of the event, additional blood 
specimens using the immune respons e lab kit, per the laboratory manual. This assessment 
includes serum histamine, serum tryptase, immunoglobulin E, and complement components .
10.2 Pregnancy
Although not necessarily considered an adverse event, a pregnancy in a patient in the study 
must be recor ded on an Adverse Event Form , as well as on a Pregnancy Form (paper), even if 
no adverse event associated with the pregnancy has occurred. Pregnancies must be reported to 
Lundbeck using the same expedited reporting timelines as those for SAEs.
Once complet ed, Pregnancy Form (paper) shall be sent to:
Fax: +45 36 30 99 67
email: ICSRquery@lundbeck.com
If sent by email, the investigator must ensure that the Pregnancy Form is sent password 
protected and that the password is sent in a separate email.
An uncompl icated pregnancy should not be reported as a SAE; hospitali sation for a normal 
birth should not be reported as an SAE. If, however, the pregnancy is associated with a SAE, 
the appropriate serious criterion must be indicated on the Serious Adverse Event For m. 
Examples of pregnancies to be reported as SAEs (medically important) are spontaneous 
abortions, stillbirths, and malformations.
The investigator must follow up on the outcome of the pregnancy and report it on a 
Pregnancy Form (paper). The follow -up must include information on the neonate at least up 
until the age of 1 month.
If required by local regulations, the patient and her partner will be asked to sign a separate 
Informed Consent Form in case of pregnancy.
10.3 Recording Adverse Events
Adverse events (including pre -treatment adverse events) must be recorded on an Adverse 
Event Form . The investigator must provide information on the adverse event, preferably with 
a diagnosis, or at least with signs and symptoms; start and stop date s(and s tart and stop time 
if the adverse event lasts less than 24 hours or occurs on the day of eptinezumab
administration); intensity; causal relationship to eptinezumab ; action taken; and outcome. If 
the adverse event is not related to eptinezumab , an alternati ve aetiology must be recorded, if 
available. If the adverse event is an overdose, the nature of the overdose must be stated (for

changes during the course of the adv erse event, this must be recorded on the AE Intensity Log .
If the adverse event is serious , this must be indicated on the Adverse Event Form . 
Furthermore, the investigator must fill out a Serious Adverse Event Form and report the SAE 
to Lundbeck immediatel y (within 24 hours) after becoming aware of it (see section 10.4).
If individual adverse events are later linked to a specific diagnosis, the diagnos is should be 
reported and linked to the previously reported adverse events.
10.4 Reporting Serious Adverse Events
The investigator must report SAEs to Lundbeck immediately (within 24 hours) after 
becoming aware of them by completing a Serious Adverse Event Form within the eCRF 
Rave®.
The initial Serious Adverse Event Form must contain as much information as possible and, if 
more information about the patient’s condition becomes available, the Serious Adverse Event 
Form must be updated with the additional informa tion.
If the investigator cannot report the SAE in Rave®, then he or she must complete and sign the 
Serious Adverse Event Fallback Form and send it to:
Fax: +45 36 30 99 67
email: ICSRquery@lundbeck.com
When Rave is available again, the site must enter the SAE information into Rave.
If sent by email, the investigator must ensure that the SAE Fallback Formis sent password 
protected and that the password is sent in a separate email.
Lundbeck will assume responsibility for reporting SAEs to the autho rities in accordance with 
local requirements.
It is the investigator’s responsibility to be familiar with local requirements regarding reporting 
SAEs to the EC or IRB and to act accordingly.
Lundbeck will assume responsibility for reporting SUSARs to the a uthorities in accordance 
with local requirements. In those Member States of the European Union that have 
implemented the European Union Clinical Trials Directive54, Lundbeck will also assume 
responsibility for reporting SUSARs to the ECs.
Lundbeck will ass ess the expectedness of SAEs and inform the investigator(s) about SUSARs 
in the SUSAR listings.

Study 19385A –Clinical Study Protocol Page 80of 9810.5 Treatment and Follow -up of Adverse Events
Patients with adverse events must be treated in accordance with usual clinical practice at the 
discretion of the inves tigator.
Non-serious adverse events must be followed up until resolution or the SFU Visit, whichever 
comes first. At the SFU Visit, information on new adverse events , if any, and stop dates for 
previously reported adverse events must be recorded.
The inves tigator must follow up on all SAEs until the patient has recovered, stabilized, or 
recovered with sequelae, and report to Lundbeck all relevant new information using the same 
procedures and timelines as those for the initial Serious Adverse Event Form .
SAE s that are spontaneously reported by a patient to the investigator after the SFU Visit must 
be handled in the same manner as SAEs that occur during the study considering relation to 
IMP. These SAEs will be recorded in the Lundbeck safety database.
The inve stigator must follow up on p atients with a clinically significant out -of-range clinical 
safety laboratory test value at the Completion Visit (Week 48/Visit 14) or Withdrawal Visit in 
accordance with usual clinical practice. If the clinically significant ou t-of-range clinical safety 
laboratory test value has not normalized or stabilized or a diagnosis or a reasonable 
explanation has not been established by the SFU Visit, the investigator must decide whether 
further follow -up visits are required (this may inc lude an additional medical examination 
and/or additional blood sampling). If further follow- up visits are made, these must be 
documented in the patient’s medical records and not in the eCRF.
Patients who withdraw due to an elevated AST or ALT value (see se ction 6.2) must be 
followed until the values normalize or stabilize or a diagnosis or a reasonable explanation has 
been established. Additional medical examinations (for example, ultrasound scanning an d/or 
sampling for serology, conjugated bilirubin, prothrombin time) should be considered. A 
gastroenterology or hepatology consultation should also be considered.
11Data Handling and Record Keeping
11.1 Data Collection
11.1.1 Electronic Case Report Forms
eCRFs will be used to collect all the data related to the study, except the external data 
described in section 11.1.3 .
The eCRFs use third party software (Rave®) to capture data via an online system on a 
computer. When the investigator enters data in the eCRF (ideally during the visit or as soon as 
possible [<3 days] thereafter), the data will be recorded electronically in a central database 
over encrypted lines, an d all entries and modifications to the data will be logged in an audit

Written instructions for using the system will be provided along with the training.
Electronic signatures will be used where signatures are required on pages and/or visits. 
Automated data entry checks will be implemented where appropriate; other data will be 
reviewed and evaluated for accuracy by Lundbeck and/or representatives from the CRO . All 
entries, corrections, and changes must be made by the investigator or a delegate.
11.1.2 Patient Binders
11.1.2.1 Use of Patient Binders
APatient Binder will be provided for each patient. The Patient Binder contains different 
types of source documents, organi sed by visit and type. A ballpoint pen with waterproof ink 
must be used to enter information in the Patient Binder .
11.1.2.2 Serious Adverse Event Fallback Forms
Serious Adverse Event Fallback Forms must be used when the eCRF cannot be accessed.
11.1.3 External Data
All electronic data will be transferred by the designated vendor and kept in a secure 
designated storage area outside the eCRF:
eDiary data
ePRO data
ECG results
Clinical safety laboratory data
Biobanking data: RNA, metabolomics/proteomics, ADA including NAb, DNA (optional)
Biomarker analysis results
Eptinezumab quantification results
11.2 Retention of Study Documents at the Clinical Site
11.2.1 eCRF Data
If a site closes before the study has been completed, the investigator will continue to have 
read- only access to the eCRF until the study has been completed . After the study has been 
completed, all user access to the eCRF will be revoked . Renewed access to the eCRF will be 
given if corrections or update sto the database are required.
At the end of the study, the clinical site will be provided with all data related to the clinical 
site (including eCRF data, queries, and the audit trail) using a secure electronic medium; the 
secure storage of these data at the clinical site is the responsibility of the investigator. When

eCRF will be revoked. If, for some reason, the data are not readable for the full retention 
period ( 25years or in accordance with national requirements, whichever is longer ), the 
investigator may request that the data be re -sent.
11.2.2 Other Study Documents
The investigator must keep the investigator’s set of documents in the investigator site file for 
at leas t 25years after the Clinical Study Report has been approved or in accordance with 
national requirements, whichever is longer. Lundbeck will remind the investigator in writing 
of this obligation when the Clinical Study Report Synopsis is distributed to the clinical site.
If off -site storage is used, a study
-specific binder will remain at the clinical site after the other 
study -specific documents have been shipped for off -site storage. This binder is considered 
part of the investigator site file and must be kept in a secure place by the clinical site for the 
required period of time. The binder must contain, at a minimum, the following documents: a 
copy of the Investigator Site File Index , a certified copy of the Patient Identification Co de 
List, and a Retrieval Form .
When the required storage period has expired, the documents may be destroyed in accordance 
with regulations.
12Monitoring Procedures
Prior to allowing patients to participate in the study, the investigator must sign a source da ta 
agreement that identifies the source documents (original documents, data, and records) at the 
clinical site. The document will also list which data may be recorded directly on the eCRFs.
Only patients with cCH may be enrolled in the study. The patient’s medical records are the 
most comprehensive source to document the patient’s diagnosis. Thus, it is required that the 
investigator obtains copies of medical records for each patient. In case the investigator does 
not have medical records for a patient at his/her own clinic, the investigator must obtain 
copies/written summary of relevant medical records from the previous treating physician and 
include the pertinent documentation in the patient’s medical records at the clinical site. If 
original medical records are unavailable, any properly documented communication with the 
treating physician, letters, written summaries, photocopies of medical records, pharmacy 
records and specific letter templa tes may be used to document the cCH diagnosis and 
previous acute medication use for cCH, covering a period of at least 12 months prior to the 
Screening Visit and general medical history prior to the study. Information about changes in 
the patient’s medical history, treatment for cCH and other concomitant medication that might 
occur between the Screening Visit and the Baseline Visit must be obtained, using the above

monitoring of the eCRFs, the clinical site’s recruitment rate, and the compliance of the 
clinical site to the protocol and Good Clinical Practice . In addition, the CRA will be available 
for discussions by telephone.
Source data verification requires t hat the CRA be given direct access to all the source 
documents. Direct access includes permission to examine and verify any records that are 
important for the evaluation of the study.
Due to COVID -19, if the clinical site is closed to the CRO ’s monitor forsafety measures, 
remote source data verification may be done in exceptional cases, if allowed per local and site 
regulations.
13Audits and Inspections
Authori sed personnel from Medical, Regulatory and Clinical Quality Assurance, 
H.Lundbeck A/S, and quality assurance personnel from business partners may audit the study 
at any time to assess compliance with the protocol and the principles of Good Clinical 
Practice and all other relevant regulations.
The investigator must be aware that representatives from reg ulatory authorities may also wish 
to inspect source data, such as medical records. The investigator must notify Lundbeck, 
without delay, of an announced inspection by a regulatory authority.
During audits and inspections, the investigator must permit direc t access to all the source 
documents, including medical records and other documents pertinent to the study .
During audits and inspections, the auditors and inspectors may request relevant parts of 
medical records. No personal identification apart from the screening number swill appear on 
these copies.
Patient data will not be disclosed to unauthori sed third parties, and patient confidentiality will 
be respected at all times.
14Protocol Compliance
Lundbeck has a “no -waiver” policy, which means that permission will not be given to deviate 
from the protocol.
If a deviation occurs, the investigator must inform the CRA and they must review, discuss, 
and document the implications of the deviation.

Study 19385A –Clinical Study Protocol Page 84of 9815Study Termination
Lundbeck or a pertinent regulatory authority may terminate the study or part of the study at 
any time. The reasons for such action may include, but are not limited to:
safety concerns ;
proven lack of efficacy of anti -CGRP agents in clinical studie s sponsored by Lundbeck or 
competitors.
If the st udy is terminated or suspended, the investigator must promptly inform the patients 
and ensure appropriate therapy and follow -up. Furthermore, the investigator and/or Lundbeck 
must promptly inform the EC or IRB and provide a detailed written explanation. The 
pertinent regulatory authorities must be informed in accordance with national regulations.
If the risk/benefit evaluation changes after the study is terminated, the new evaluation must be 
provided to the EC or IRB if it will have an impact on the planned follow -up of the patients 
who participated in the study. If so, the actions needed to protect the patients must be 
described.
16Statistical Methodology
16.1 Responsibilities
Biostatistics, H. Lundbeck A/S will perform the statistical analyses for the Clinical Study 
Report .
16.2 Analysis Sets
The following analysis sets will be used to analyse and present the data:
all-patients -enrolled set (APES) -all-patients -enrolled
all-patients -treated set (APTS) -all patients in the APES who receive infusion with 
eptinezumab
full-analysis set (FAS) -all patients in the APTS who ha vea valid assessment of the
baseline number of monthly attacks and a post- baseline assessment of number of monthly 
attacks
The safety and tolerability analyses, and the exposure, disposition, and demographics and 
baseline characteristics will be based on the APTS. The efficacy analy ses will be based on the 
FAS.
16.3 Descriptive Statistics
In general, summary statistics (n, arithmetic mean, standard deviation, median, lower and 
upper quartiles, minimum and maximum values) will be presented for continuous variables 
and counts and, if releva nt, percentages will be presented for categorical variables.

Patient disposition will be summarised and include the number of patients in the APTS who 
completed or withdrew from treatment, as well as the number of patients in each analy sis set 
(APES, APTS, and FAS).
The number of patients who withdrew from the study will be summaris ed by primary reason 
for withdrawal and all reasons for withdrawal.
16.5 Demographics and Baseline Characteristics
Demographics (sex, age, and race), baseline char acteristics (height, weight, and BMI), 
baseline efficacy variables, and other disease characteristics will be summari sed by visit .
16.6 Recent and Concomitant Medication
Recent and concomitant medication will be summari sed by anatomical therapeutic chemical 
(ATC
)code and generic drug name by visit .
16.7 Exposure and Compliance
Exposure and compliance will be calculated per patient and summari sed by visit.
The number of patients infused and patients who had their infusion interrupted will be 
summarised by visit. Pati ents whose infusion took more than 60 min utes and patients who had 
their infusion interrupted will be listed with period, infusion start date/time and end date/time, 
and reasons if any.
16.8 Efficacy Analyses
16.8.1 General Efficacy Analysis Methodology
All confidence intervals ( CIs) will be 95% CIs, unless otherwise specified.
Baseline number of weekly attacks will be derived from eDiary data collected in the 
Screening Period (Week -4 to Day 0).
16.8.2 Analysis of the Secondary Endpoints
Details on derivations and imputations of eDiary data (daily or weekly data entries) , as well as 
sub-group analyses, will be described in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) .

The estimated means, standard errors and CIs will be provided by visit. For response variables 
the counts, percentages and CIwill be presented by visit.
16.8.3 Testing Strategy
No formal testing will be done.
16.9 Safety Analyses
The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the long -term safety and tolerability of 
eptinezumab in patients with cCH. This will be evaluated based on the collected data on 
adverse events, vital signs, weight, ECGs, clinical safety laboratory test values, C -SSRS, 
ADA and NAbs.
16.9.1 Analysis of Adverse Events
Adverse events will be classified according to the time of onset of the adverse event:
pre-treatment adverse event – an adverse event that starts on or after the date the patient 
signed the Informed Consent Form (s)and prior to the date o f first dose of eptinezumab
treatment -emergent adverse event (TEAE) –an adverse event that starts or increases in 
intensity during or after administration of the first dose of eptinezumab
Adverse events, sorted by system organ class ( SOC ) and preferred term, will be summaris ed 
for the full study and by 3 -month periods.
Allocation of TEAEs to Study Periods
TEAEs may be allocated to study periods (these will be defined in the Statistical Analysis 
Plan ).
16.9.2 Analysis of Other Safety Endpoints
Absolute values and change from baseline for vital signs, weight, ECGs, clinical safety 
laboratory test values will be summarised by visit. The number of patients exceeding the PCS 
values will be tabulated. The incidence, kinetics and magnitude of ADA and N Abresponse (s) 
will be evaluated.

Study 19385A –Clinical Study Protocol Page 87of 9816.11 Sample Size and Power
In line with the ICH E1 guideline,1the study aims at providing data in 100 patients exposed to 
eptinezumab for 1 year. Dodick (2020),2in patients suffering from cCH included in a 
12-week study, reports less than 4% withdrawals. In the European Union Drug Regulating 
Authorities Clinical Trials ( EudraCT )report for study [STUDY_ID_REMOVED],3in patients suffering 
from cCH, approximately 7% of patients dropped out from the first 12
-week period; the 
withdrawals due to the “sponsor terminated study” are not included as a reason for 
withdrawal. As the withdrawal rate for a long- term study like the current study is unknown, 
125 patients are planned to be enrolled and treated, allowing for 100 patients to complete, 
with a withdrawal rate of 20%. The withdrawal rate will be monitored during the study 
conduct, and if a clear deviation from the assu med withdrawal rate is observed, the number of 
patients enrolled and treated might be increased to ensure that data is available for a sufficient 
number of patients with long -term exposure.

OVERALL RATIONALE FO R THE REVISED PROTOCOL 03
As of 23-August -2018, enrollment into theCA209602 study  was permanent ly closed due to 
insufficient benefit observed based on the interim futility analysis ofprogressi on free survival 
(PFS). Subjects rando mized to the nivolumab+p omalidomide (NPd)or nivolumab+elotuzumab 
+pomalidomide (NEPd )arms may continue treatm ent based on investigator’s judgement of 
continued clinical benefit. The s tudy will close af ter all  enrolled subjects com plete safet y follow-
up (i.e., 100 days after the last subject has discont inued study treatm ent). To align with this change ,
study  assessments have been modified : all efficacy assessments will now be based on investigator 
evaluat ion rather than by an independent review commi ttee (IRC), bone marrow aspirate collectio n 
time- points and samples are reduce  
 as of Revised Protocol 03.
Addit ional changes include update of the Nivo lumab Management Al gorithms (Appendix 5) and 
Pomalidomi de Pregnancy Risk Prevent ion Plan(Appendix 6)and a minor modification of 
Appendix 3: Definit ions of Response and Progressio n Criteria.

Clinical Protocol CA209602
BMS -936558 nivolumab
A cycle is defined as 28 day s. Treatment with stu dy drug continues until disease prog ression, unacceptable toxicity , 
or subject meets other criteria for discontinuation of study drug outlined in Section 3.5.
Study Phase: 3
Research Hypothesis: .The additio n of nivolumab to pomalidomide and dexamethasone will increase the clinical 
benefit represented by increased progression free survival (PFS) and higher response rate compared to poma lidomide 
and dexamethasone in subjects with relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma.
Objectives : 
Primary Objectives
The primary objective isto compare progression free survival (PFS) between N -Pd and Pd arms , by investigator .
Secondary Objective s
To estimate overall survival (OS) within N -Pd and Pd arms 
To assess the time to objective response (TTR) within N -Pd and Pd arms by investigator
To assess the duration of objective response (DOR) within N -Pd and Pd arms by investigato r
To compare ORR between N -Pd and Pd arms, by investigator .
Exploratory Objectives
To evaluate efficacy  of NE-Pd in subjects with relapsed and /orrefra ctory multiple Myeloma within NE -Pd arm
through the assessment of ORR and PFS
To evaluate efficacy of NE-Pd in subjects whocross ed over from the control arm (Pd) to the exploratory arm 
(NE-Pd) through the assessment of ORR and PFS
Toassess safet y and tolerability
Study Design : 
This is a phase 3 multicenter, randomized, open label study designed to evaluate the clinical benefit and safety of the 
combinatio n the rapy of Nivolumab, pomalidomide, and dexamethason e (N-Pd the investigational arm -armA) , when 
compared to pomalidomide and dexamethasone (Pd ; the control arm -arm B ) in subjects with relapsed and/o r refractory 
multiple myeloma (rrMM). Revised Protocol 0 1 included a n exploratory third arm evaluating the clinical benefit and 
the safety of the combination therapy  of elotuzumab, nivolumab, pomalid omide and dexamethasone (NE-Pd, the 
exploratory arm -arm C ) in the same patient population. Additionally, subjects randomized to the Pd arm were allowed 
to cross over to this exploratory NE-Pd arm at the time of progression. Cross over was stopped as of 1 September 
2017. Enrol lment in the NE -Pd exploratory arm was stopped as of Protocol version 02 All subjects already randomized 
to the NE-Pd arm, or who crossed over from the Pd to the NE-Pd arm will continue on study as long as they have 
clinical benefit and do not meet the study discontinuation criteria.

Initially, the study was designed toenroll approximately 417subjects for a total of 348subjects to be randomized
(assum ing 20% screen failure rate) to N-PdandPd in a 1:1 ratio. Randomization wasperformed with the following 
stratification factors: a) number of lines of prior therapy (2 vs3+); AND b) ISS stage (1 -2 vs 3 ).
Subjects were to continue treatment as long as the subject has clinical benefit from the treatment and does not meet 
criteria for treatment discontinuation.
As of 23-August -2018, the further enrollment of CA209602 study was permanently closed due to the insufficient 
benefit observed based on the interim futility analysis of PFS. A total of 170 subjects were randomized into the st udy: 
75 to NPd, 71 to Pd and 24 to NE -Pd arms. Subjects randomized to the NPd or NEPd arms may  continue  treatment 
based on investigator’s  judgement  of continued clinical benefit. Study will be closed after all subjects complete safety 
follow -up (i.e., 100 days after the last subject has discontinued study treatment). 
The study  design schematic is presented below:
Study Population: Subjects who are diagnosed with refractory  or relapsed multiple myeloma defined as:
1.Must have received 2 prior lines of therapy which must have included an immune modulatory drug (IMiD) 
and a proteasome inhibitor (PI) alo ne or in combination. Subject must have received at least 2consecutive 
cycles of an IMiD and at least 2 consecutive cycles of a PI. The dose of the pri or IMiD (eg ,lenalidomide) to 
which the subject has relapsed or been refractory  must be the induction dose and NOT a maintenance dose 
(Note: adjusted induction dose for intolerance reasons or for renal impairment is accepted).
2.Documented refractory or rela psed and refractory (R/R) multiple myeloma
3.Refractory ( lack of response or progressed on or within 60 days of the last dose of treatment) to their last line 
of treatment . Lack of response is defined as not having achieved at least PR.i
4.Subjects must have failed treatment with a proteasome inhibitor and an IMID in one of the following ways :
a.“Refractory ” = Refractory ( lack o rresponse or progressed on treatment or within 60 days of the last 
dose of treatment, regardless of the achievement of initial response) to a proteasome inhibitor and 
an IMiD .Lack of response is defined as not having achieved at least PR.i

Study Assessments :Tumo r response assessmen t by IMWG criteria will be evaluated during the trial for all 
randomized subjects. The primary endpoint PFS will be based on the investigator .
Statistical Considerations :
Sample Size: 
In Revised Protocol 02, t he planned sample size for this study was revised to approximately 348 randomized subjects 
randomized at a 1:1 ratio to N -Pd vs Pd. The sample size of the study  accounts for the primary  efficacy endpoint of 
PFS. PFS will be evaluated for treatment effect at the overall alpha level of 0.05 (two-sided) with 90% power with 
twointerim analy ses, with the first one for early futility and the second for efficacy .
The study requires at least 262 PFS events to ensure that a two-sided 5% type I error sequential test procedure with 
twointerim analy ses will have 90% p ower to detect a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.667, corresponding to a median PFS of 
6 vs 4 months for the N -Pd and Pd arms, respectively.
On 23 -August -2018 , the Sponsor (BMS) decided to permanently discontinue enrol lment based on insufficient clinical 
benefit ob served at an interim futility analysis for PFS. A total of 170 subjects have been randomized in the study .
Endpoints:
Primary  Endpoints:
The primary objective in the study will be measured by the primary endpoint PFS by investigator within the N -Pd and 
Pdarms.

Analyses:
PFS Analysis Timepoints
At the time of PFS analyses, as assessed by investigator , the distribution of PFS in N -Pd group will be compared 
with the Pd arm via a two -sided, log -rank test stratified by prior lines of therapy and ISS stage at study entry . The 
hazard ratio (HR) and the corresponding 100x(1 -adjusted alpha)% confidence interval (CI) will be estimated in a 
stratified Cox proportional ha zards model using treatment as a single covariate. 
PFS curves, PFS medians with two-sided 95% CIs, and PFS rates at at select milestone with 95% CIs will be 
estimated using Kaplan -Meier methodology.
Analy sis of OS
At the time of PFS analyses, OS will be summarized by the Kaplan -Meier product limit method within each arm. 
Median values along with two -sided 95% CIs based on the log log transformation, will be calculated. Additional 
details of OS analysis will be inclu ded in the SAP
Analy sis of ORR by investigator
Investigator -determined ORR analy ses will be conducted using a two sided Cochran Mantel Haenszel (CMH) 
test stratified by prio r lines of therapy  and ISS stage at study entry  to compare N -Pd to Pd arm. Associa ted odds 
ratios and 95% CIs will be calculated. Additionally , ORRs and corresponding 95% exact CIs will be calculated 
using the Clopper Pearson method for N -Pd and Pd arms
Analy sis of DOR and TTR
DOR and TTR will be computed for subjects who achieve sCR, CR, VGPR, or PR as assessed by investigator
according to modified IMWG criteria . Median values of DOR, alo ng with two -sided 95% CI, will be calculated 
using KM product -limit method. Summary statist ics of TTR will be provided. More detailed analy sis of DOR 
and TTR will be described in the statistical analysis plan (SAP) .
Details on the testing procedure will be described in SAP.
Safety Analysis
The safety analy sis will be performed in all treated subjects. Descriptive statistics of safety  will be presented using 
Natio nal Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0 by treatment 
group. Adverse Events (AE), drug-related AEs, Serious Adverse Events (SAE) and drug-related SAEs will be 
tabulated using worst grade per NCI CTCAE v.4.0 criteria by system organ class and preferred term. On-study lab 
parameters including hematology, chemistry, liver function and renal function will be summarized using worst grade 
per NCI CTCAE v.4.0 criteria.

1 I NTRODUCTION AND STUDY RATIONALE
1.1 Multiple Myeloma 
Amo ng hematol ogic malignancies, multiple myeloma (MM) is the second most prevalent blood 
cancer after non-Hodgkin lympho ma, representing 10% of hematol ogic malignancies. In the 
United States there are an est imated 26,850 new cases and 11,240 deaths predicted for 20151.The 
incidence of MM in Europe is 4.5 to 6.0/100,000/year and the mortalit y is 4.1/100,000/y ear1.The 
incidence of MM increases with advancing age and the median age of diagnosis in the US is 
70years1and in Europe between 65 and 70 y ears1.
MM is a germinal center -derived tumor with mainly a post -switch B -cell phenoty pe characterized 
by extensive gene hypermutati on in a patte rn suggesting ant igen select ion.It is the m ost frequent 
primary  neoplasm o f the bone marrow. Pathologically, it stems from an e xpansio n of a sing le clo ne 
of abnorm al terminally different iated B cells (plasma cells) that produce a monoclonal 
immunogl obulin (M -protein) and replace the normal bone marrow, leading to hy pofunctioning o f 
the bone marrow, osteolyt ic bone lesio ns, hypercalcemia, and renal disease2.
1.2 Current Treatment Regimens and Unmet Medical Need
Current ly approved treatments commo nly used for patients with relapsed / refractory MM include 
prote asome inhibitor (PI) based therapies (eg, bortezomib, carfilzo mib), immune modulatory  drug 
(IMiD) based therapi es (thalido mide, lenalido mide, or pomalido mide) and histone deacet ylase 
inhibitors.3,4More recent ly an oral proteasome inhibitor ( ixazomib ) as well as new drug classes, 
elotuzum ab (anti-SLAMF7 monoclonal antibody) and daratum umab (anti-CD38 monoclonal 
antibody ) have also been approved for treatm ent of rrMM. There is no cure and current therapi es 
can only slow disease progressi on, prolong survival, and minimize symptom s. While recent 
advances in the use of high-dose chemo therapy, targeted therapeuti cs, and stem  cell transplantati on 
have improved overall and event -free survival, the majorit y of patients with myelo ma will relapse 
and disease progression is expected for all but a small percentage.5Mult iple myelo ma is associa ted 
with morbidi ty and m ortali ty, thus reflecting a significant unmet medical need.
1.3 Study Rationale
1.3.1 Rationale for Nivolumab Development in Multiple Myeloma 
Multiple myelo ma (MM) is characterized by immune suppression in the bone marrow (BM) 
microenvironment which supports immune evasio n and a growth advantage for malignant plasma 
cells. The nature of this suppression involves many cell types that have been implicated in 
inhibit ing immune responses to con trol myeloma cell growth. In part, PD-L1 has been shown to 
play a role in mediat ing inhibit ion of both adaptive and innate immunit y in t he bone marrow milieu 
of MM patients. As PD-L1 is over-expressed on MM cells and other cells in the BM 
microenvironment from MM patients, its receptor PD-1 is also found over-expressed on both 
CD8+ T and some NK cell subsets. Therefore PD-L1 mediated suppression of PD1+ T and NK 
cells is one potenti almechanism in place to confer immune escape.

PD-L1 in MM
1)PD-L1 on myelo ma cells:
While PD-L1 is seldo m found on normal plasma cells, myelo ma cells frequent ly express PD-L1 
and this expressio n is further enhanced when cultured with bone marrow stromal cells 
(BMSCs).6,7,8Limit ed data to date also suggests that PD -L1 expressio n on myelo ma cells may be 
increased with disease burden, stage and at time of relapse suggest ing a possible mechanism for 
immune escape from current therapies .9
Figure 1.3.1 -1: PD-L1 expression in myeloma cells.
a., b:PD-L1 expression is increased on B M my eloma cells in MM patients
c:PD-L1 expression on BM plasma cells may be increased with disease stage
d:increase in PD -L1 on BM plasma cells associated with progression (within individual patients).6,9
2)PD-L1 on immune cells in MM:
PD-L1 can also m ediate suppressi on of  immune effector functi on through i ts expressi on on other 
cells in the BM of MM patients. PD-L1 is found to be over-expressed on both MDSCs 
(myeloid-derived suppressor cells) and pDCs (plasmacy toid dendri tic cells) in the BM of MM 
patients and this expressio n has been shown to drive suppressio n of both CD8+ T and NK and cell 
responses in vitro.8,10
PD-1 in MM
PD-1 plays a role in maintaining T cell homeostasis and its expression on T cells is generally 
associ ated with an antigen-activated or an exhausted phenoty pe.Increased frequency of PD-1+ 
Tcell subsets have been reported in many tum or types including MM.8,11Increased frequency o f 
PD1+ NK cells have also been observed in the BM of MM patients.8,12Therefore expressio n of 
PD-1 on cytolytic immune cells such as CD8+ Tand NK cells (Figure 1.3.1 -2) represents a 
possible mechanism of how PD-L1-expressing tumor cells and suppressive immune cells can 
inhibit effector cell funct ion conferring immune escape and growth of myelo ma cells.12

Effects of PD-1 and/or PD-L1 blockade in enhancing immune cell function and killing of 
myeloma cells.
The PD -1/PD -L1 axis imposes an inhibitory mechanism to reduce effector cell funct ion and killing 
of mye loma cells. This state of inhibit ion is mediated in part through tumor cell PD -L1 suppressio n 
of effector cells.Blocking antibodies targeting PD-1 or PD-L1 (or both) can directly enhance 
effector cell funct ion and killing of myeloma cells in vit ro (Figure 1.3.1 -3).Addit ionally, 
PD-1/PD -L1-blocking antibodies can inhibit suppressive mechanisms in vit ro mediated by 
PD-L1+ MDSCs and pDCs, and overcome bone marrow stromal cell (BMSC) -induced growth of 
myelo ma cells.8

Nivo lumab is a fully human, IgG4 (κ) isotype mAb that binds PD- 1 on activated immune cells a nd 
disrupts engagement of the receptor with its ligands PD-L1(B7 -H1/CD274) and 
PD-L2(B7 -DC/CD273), thereby  abrogating inhibit ory signals and augm enting the host anti tumor 
response. 
Nivo lumab has demonstrated clinical activit y as monotherapy  in subjects with a  v ariety of 
malignancies including lung, melanoma, renal cell carcinom a and in lympho mas, responses have 
been reported for diffuse large B -cell lympho ma, follicular lympho ma, head and neck cancer, and 
Hodgkin’s lympho ma.
Approximately  8,000 subjects have received nivolumab monotherapy  in single- or multip le-dose 
Phase 1/2/3 studies or studies with nivo lumab in combinat ion with other therapeuti cs (ipilimumab, 
cytotoxi c chem otherapy , anti  angiogenics, and targeted therapi es).The safet y profile is generally 
consistent across completed and ongoing clinical trials, with no maximum tolerated dose (MTD) 
reached at any monotherapy  dose tested up to 10 mg/kg. There was no pattern in the incidence, 
severit y, or causalit y of AEs to nivo lumab dose level. The safet y profile of nivo lumab combinat ion 
therapy  varies with the agent combined with nivo lumab, but is generally consistent with the safet y

than that observed with either agent alone. For nivolumab monotherapy and combinat ion therapy , 
most high -grade events were manageable wit h use of corticosteroids and/or horm one replacement  
therapy .
Nivo lumab is indicated for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma as 
both a single agent and in co mbinat ion with ipilimumab. Nivo lumab is also approved for non-small 
cell lung cancer fo llowing failure on or after platinum based therapy, as well as for advanced rena l 
cell carcino ma following treatm ent with an ant i-angiogenic therapy .Opdivo (nivo lumab) is 
approved for use in multiple countri es including the United States (US Dec 2014), the European 
Unio n (EU June 2015) and Japan (Jul 2015). 
1.3.1.1 Rationale for Nivolumab dose and frequency
The nivolumab dose of 240 mg every 2 weeks (Q2W) was selected based on clinical data and 
modeling and simulat ion approaches using populatio n PK (PPK) and exposure -response analyses 
of data fro m studies in mult iple tumor types (melanoma, non -small -cell lung cancer [NSCLC], and 
renal cell carcino ma [RCC]) wher e body  weight norm alized dosing (mg/kg) has been used.
PPK analyses have shown that the PK of nivolumab is linear with proporti onal exposure over a 
dose range of 0.1 to 10 mg/kg, and no differences in PK across ethnicit ies and tumor ty pes were 
observed. Nivolumab clearance and volume of distribut ion were found to increase as the body 
weight increases, but less than the proporti onal with increasing weight, indicat ing that mg/kg 
dosing represents an over-adjustment for the effect of body weight on nivolumab PK. The PPK 
model previously devel oped using data from NSCLC subjects has recent ly been updated, using 
data from 1544 subjects from 7 studies investigating nivolumab in the treatm ent of melanoma, 
NSCLC, and RCC. In this dataset, the median (minimum -maximu m) weight was 77 kg 
(35kg -160 kg) and thus, an approximately  equivalent dose of 3 mg/kg for an 80 kg subject, 
nivolumab 240 mg Q2W was selected for future studi es. To predi ct rel evant summary  exposures 
of nivolumab 240 mg Q2W, the PPK model was used to simulate nivolumab 3 mg/kg Q2W and 
240mg Q2W. In the simulat ions, the simulated patient populat ions consisted of 1000 subjects per 
treatm ent arm randomly sampled from aforem entioned pooled database of cancer subjects. 
Because no differences in PK were noted across ethnicit ies and tumor types, these simulated 
melano ma and NSCLC data will be applicable to subjects wi th other tum or ty pes. The simulated 
measure of exposure of interest, time- averaged concentrati ons (Cavgss) for 240 mg Q2W are 
predi cted to be si milar for all subjects in reference to 80 kg subjects receiving 3 mg/kg Q2W.
Nivo lumab is safe and well  tolerated up to 10 m g/kg Q2W dose level. Adverse events have been 
broadly  consistent across tumor types following monotherapy  and have not demonstrated clear 
dose-response or exposure -response relationships. Addit ionally, the simulated median and 95th 
predi ction interval of  nivolumab summary exposures across body  weight range (35 -160 kg) are 
predi cted to be maintained below the corresponding observed highest exposure experienced in 
nivolumab ie, 95th percentile fo llowing nivo lumab 10 mg/kg Q2W fro m clinical study CA209003. 
Thus, while subjects in the lower body weight ranges woul d have greater exposures than 80 kg 
subjects, the exposures are predicted to be within the range o f observed exposures at doses (up to

10 m g/kg Q2W) used in the nivo lumab clinical program, and are not considered to put subjects at 
increased risk. For subjects with greater body  weights, the simulated ranges of exposures are also 
not expected to affect efficacy, because the exposures predi cted following administration of a 
240mg Q2W are on the flat part of the exposure -response curves for previously invest igated 
tumors, m elano ma and NSCLC. Given the similarity of nivo lumab PK across tumor types and the 
similar exposures predicted fo llowing administration of 240 mg flat dose compared to 3 mg/kg, it 
is expected that the safet y and efficacy  profile of 240mg nivolumab will be similar to that of 
3mg/kg nivo lumab. Thus nivo lumab 240 mg e very 2 weeks over 30 minutes for the first 4 months 
will be used this study .
At 4 months after init iation o f treatm ent, subj ects will be switched from nivo lumab 240 mg ever y 
2weeks to nivol umab 480 mg every  4 weeks (Q4W), which provides a more convenient dosing 
regimen for subjects. Based on PK mo deling and simulat ions, administration of nivo lumab 480mg 
Q4W will be started after steady  state is achieved with 240 mg Q2W and is predi cted to provide 
Cavgss similar to 240 mg Q2 W. While 480 mg Q4W is predicted to provide greater (approximately 
20%) maximum steady  state concentrations and lower (approximately 10%) steady  state trough 
concentrations, these exposures are predicted to be within the exposure ranges observed at doses 
up to 10 mg/kg Q2W used in the nivolumab clinical program, and are not considered to put subjects 
at increased risk. Similar to the nivo lumab 240 mg Q2W dosing regimen, the exposures predicted 
following administration of nivo lumab 480 mg Q4W, are on the flat part of the exposure -response 
curves for previously  invest igated tumors, melanoma and NSCLC, and are not predicted to affect 
efficacy . Based on these data, nivolumab 480 mg Q4W is expected to have similar efficacy  and 
safet y profiles to nivo lumab 240 mg Q2W.
1.3.1.2 Rationale for Nivolumab 30 Minute Infusion
Long infusion times place a burden on subjects and treatment centers. Establishing that nivo lumab 
can be safely administered using shorter infusio n times of 30 minutes duration in subjects will 
diminish the burden provided no change in safety profile. Previous clinical studi es show that 
nivolumab has been administered safely  over 60 minutes at doses ranging up to 10mg/kg over 
long treatm ent duration. In Study  CA209010, (a Phase 2, randomized, doubl e blinded, 
dose-ranging study  of nivolumab in subjects with advanced/metastatic clear cell RCC) a dose 
associ ation was observed for infusio n site reactio ns and hypersensit ivity react ions (1.7% at 
0.3mg/kg, 3.7% at 2 mg/kg and 18.5% at 10 mg/kg). All the events were grade 1-2 and were 
manageable. An infusion durat ion of 30 minutes for 240 mg and 480 flat doses of nivolumab 
(~60% of  the dose provided at 10 mg/kg) are not expected to present safet y concerns compared 
to the prior experience at 10 mg/kg nivo lumab dose infused over a 60 minute duration.
1.3.2 Rationale for Elotuzumab Development in Multiple Myeloma 
Elotuzumab (BMS -901608, HuLuc63) is a first-in-class, immunostimulatory , humanized 
immunogl obulin G1 (IgG1) monoclonal  antibody  (mAb) targeted against Signaling Lymphocy te 
Activation Molecule Famil y 7 (SLAMF7, also called CS1), a glycoprotein highly  expressed on 
myelo ma cells independent of cytogeneti c abnormalit ies. SLAMF7 is also expressed on natural 
killer (NK) cells and at lower levels on other immune cell subsets. SLAMF7 has not been detected

on hematopoiet ic stem  cells, nor on other normal solid organ tissues. Elotuzum ab binding to 
SLAMF7 di rectly activates NK cells, but not myelom a cells.13,14Elotuzum ab bound to myel oma 
cells via SLAMF7 further activates NK cells via Fc receptors, thereby enabl ing select ive killing 
of myeloma cells wit h minimal effects on normal tissue.15
Elotuzumab dem onstrates a dual mechanism that includes: 1) direct NK cell act ivation and 2) NK 
cell-mediated Antigen Dependent Cellular Cytotoxicit y (ADCC).
In a Phase 2 trial of elotuzum ab combined with lenalido mide and dexamethasone for 
relapsed/refractory  myeloma subjects, the obj ective response rate was 84% and median PFS was 
29months.16
Risks associated with elotuzumab in early phase studies appear to be limited primarily to infusio n 
reacti ons. These infusio n react ions are mitigated with the use of  a standard regimen of histamine 
blocking agents, acetaminophen and corticosteroids. Investigator -determined infusio n reacti ons 
were reported in 11% of subjects in the phase 2 tri al.
Phase 3 Tri al of Elotuzum ab in relapsed/refractory MM
The study  CA204004 is an ongoing Phase 3, rando mized, open -label trial invest igating the 
combinat ion of elotuzum ab with lenalidomide/low -dose dexamethasone (E-Ld) versus 
lenalido mide/low -dose dexameth asone alone (Ld) in subjects with previously  treated relapsed or 
refractory  multiple myelo ma. The primary  objectives of this study  were to com pare the ORR and 
PFS of E -Ld versus Ld. In total , 646 subj ectswere randomized and 635 were treated. At the time
of the interim analysis data cut-off, 179 (elotuzumab group, 35%; control group 21%) were still 
on-treatment. The median follow up was 24.5 months and in the elotuzum ab group, subjects
received a median of 19 (range, 1 to 42) treatm ent cycles over a median of 17 months versus 
14 (range, 1 to 40) over 12 months in the control group.
Hazard ratio for progression -free survival  was 0.70 (95% confidence interval, 0.57 to 0.85; 
P=0.0004). 1 -year progression -free survival rate in the elotuzumab group was 68%, ver sus 57% in 
the control  group; 2-year rate was 41% versus 27%. Medi an progressi on-free survival in the 
elotuzum ab group was 19.4 months versus 14.9 months in the control group. Overall response rate 
in the elotuzumab group was 79% versus 66% in the control group (P=0.0002).
In the 635 treated subjects , adverse events of any grade occurr ed in 99% of patients. In the 
elotuzum ab group, 34% of the patients experienced grade 3 to 4 neutropenia versus 44% in the 
control  group; 77% versus 49% of pat ients had grade 3 to 4 lymphopenia, respect ively. The mo st 
commo n non-hematol ogic toxicities (>30% of patients) included infect ions, fatigue, pyrexia, 
diarrhea, constipation, and cough. The most common grade 3 to 4 non -hematol ogic toxicit ies were 
fatigue and pneum onia. In the elotuzum ab group, infections were reported for 81% of patients 
versus 74% in the control  group. When adjusted for the longer drug exposure in the elotuzum ab 
group, infect ion rates were equal in both groups (incidence rate per 100 patient years, 197).
Consequent ly, despi te the higher rate of lymphopenia observed in the elotuzum ab group, there 
were no apparent untoward clinical manifestations.

In the elotuzum ab group, study drug toxicity was the primary  cause of death in 5 (2%) patients 
versus 6 (2%) in the control  group .
Thirty-five (6%) patients had a second primary malignancy: 22 (7%) in the elotuzumab group and 
13 (4%) in the control  group. The incidence rates of second hematol ogic malignancies were 
ident ical in the elotuzum ab and control  groups (2% in each group); rates of second solid tumors 
were 3% versus 2%, respect ively, and rates of non-melano ma sk in cancers were 3.1% versus 1.5%, 
respectively . When adj usted f or exposure to study  therapy , the inci dence rates of second primary 
malignancies per 100 patient -years were similar at 3.5 versus 2.8, respectively. 
Thirty-three (10%) patients receiving elotuzum ab had an infusion reacti on, including pyrexia, 
chills, and hypertension. Infusio n reacti ons were mostly grade 1 to 2; 1% were grade 3 reacti ons 
and none were grade 4 to 5. Most infusio n reactions occurred in the first 2 cycles of study therapy 
(range cycle 1, day 1 to cycle 11, day 281); five patients had an infusio n reacti on after cycle 2. 
Infusio n of elotuzum ab was interrupted in 15 (5%) patients owing to an infusio n react ion, for a 
median durati on of 15 minutes. Infusio n reactions resolved in all pat ients; however, 2 (1%) patients 
discontinued due to an infusio n reaction.
Elotuzumab may be detected in the serum  protein electrophoresis (SPEP) and serum 
immunofixat ion assays of myeloma patients and could interfere with correct response 
classificat ion.A small  peak in the early gamma region on SPEP that is IgGƙ on serum 
immunofixat ion may potentially be attributed to elotuzum ab, particularly in patients whose 
endogenous myelo ma protein is IgA, IgM, IgD, or lambda light chain restricted. This interference 
can impact the determinat ion of complete response and possi bly relapse from complete response 
in patients with IgG kappa myelo ma protein .
Elotuzumab w as approved in co mbinat ion with lenalido mide and dexamethasone for the treatment 
of patients with multiple myelo ma who have received one to three prior therapi es (FDA, 
November -2015) and in MM pati ents who have received at l east one pri or therapy  (EMA, 201 6).

1.3.2.1 Rationale for Elotuzumab dose and frequency
The dose of 10 mg/kg on D1, 8, 15 & 22 of Cycles 1 and 2 then on D1 & 15 during Cyc les3 and 4, 
used in this protocol , is the FDA approved dose and regimen of el otuzum ab in combinat ion with 
lenalido mide and dexamethasone.
Clinical Phase I and IIa studies suggests that the trough serum concentrations of elotuzum ab in 
subjects treated with 10 and 20 mg/kg doses are above the target levels ie, 70 g/ml, which is 
predi cted based on preclinical models. Following elotuzum ab dosing of 10 and 20mg/kg in 
combinat ion with lenalido mide/dex, the observed steady -state Cmin values consistent ly remained 
above 70 g/mL, the minimum efficaci ous trough concentrati ons18. Elotuzum ab dosing also 
resul ted in > 95% saturation of SLAMF7 on bone marrow plasma cells at doses 10mg/kg (Figure

Lenalidomide/ Dexamethasone (HuLuc63 1703)
Beginning at Cycle 5, elotuzumab will be administered at 20 mg/kg once ever y 4weeks. Increasing 
elotuzum ab dose and decreasing the administration of elotuzumab frequency to every 4 weeks will 
continu e to provide Cmin,ss above 70 ug/ml ,and will be more convenient for patients on long 
term therapy and therefore requi re fewer schedul ed clinic visits. With 20mg/kg Q4W, the 
simulated Cave,ss is 301ug/ml, which is similar to the 10mg/kg dosing regimen with Cave,ss 
value of 297 ug/ml. In addit ion, with the estimated Cmin,ss (geometric mean) is 141 ug/ml, and it 
remains above 70 ug/ml, which is the minimum trough concentration at which maximum efficacy 
was seen in preclinical studies and is suffic ient to maintain saturation of SLAMF7 by elotuzumab. 
Furthe r, with the 20 mg/kg Q4W dosing, the Cmax,ss (geo metric mean) is est imated as 556 ug/ml, 
which is higher than the Cmax,ss of 401 ug/ml at the 10 mg/kg dose. However, in the PPK analysis 
of elotuzum ab combinat ion with len/dex, there was no relat ionship betw een el otuzum ab exposure 
and Grade 3+ AEs hazard ratio. The point estimate indicated no increase in hazard ratio with 
increasing exposure over the range of exposures observed wi th a 10 mg/kg dosing regimen. This 
exposure-safety  analysi s indicates that incre asing exp osure may have limited im pact on the safet y

trials (HuLuc63 -1703, CA204009) and 1 ongoing tri al (CA204112). In the phase 2 porti on of  the 
HuLuc63 -1703 trial, 31 subjects had the infusio n rate escalated up to 5mL/min 
(approximately 1hour infusio n). Of the total 3412 elotuzum ab infusio ns administered, 
1127 (33%) infusio ns were given at 5 m L/min. Nearly all the su bject tol erated the faster infusi on

among the 41% of subjects and 19% of infusio ns administered at the faster rate of 5 ml/min.
In the CA204112 study , the infusio n rate was escalated to 5mL/min starting C1D15 . As of 
13Oct2015, 70 subjects were treated with a median of 6 cycles (1 -13). A total of 2 subjects (3%) 
experienced infusio n react ions (pyrexia, grade 1, and infusio n related reaction, grade 2). No grade 
3 -4 infusio n reaction was reported. Of the total of 1113 elotuzumab infusions, 968 infusions were 
given at 5mL/min with no reported infusio n reacti ons. The 2infusio n reacti ons observed were 
reported at the infusio n rate of 2mL/min.
The 5 ml/min infusio n rate for elotuzum ab will be utilized in this trial based on its safet y across 
several prior studies.
1.3.3 Rationale for Pomalidomide in Multiple Myeloma 
Pomalidomi de, a derivative of thalido mide with immuno modulatory  properti es, is approved as a 
treatm ent opti on for subje cts wi th relapsed or ref ractory  multiple myelo ma who have received at 
least two prior therapies including lenalido mide and bortezomib and who have demonstrated 
disease progressi on on or wi thin 60 days of completion of the last therapy .
Phase 3 Tri al of Pom alidomide in Third Line
Thephase 3 study  (MM- 003/NIMBUS® trial) evaluated the combinat ion of pomalidomi de with 
low-dose dexamethasone vs high -dose dexamethasone in refractory  or relapsed and refractory  MM 
subjects. A total  of 302 pati ents were randomly assi gned to receive pom alidom ide plus low-dose 
dexamethasone and 153 high -dose dexamethasone. 
Pomalidomi de was dosed at 4 mg orally on Days 1-21 of  each 28 day cycle and dexamethasone 
was given at a low dose of 40 mg/day on days 1, 8, 15, and 22, orally or at a high dose of 40mg/day
on da ys 1–4, 9–12, and 17–20, orally .Treatment continued until disease progressi on or 
unacceptable toxicit y. The primary  endpoint of the study was progressi on-free survival (PFS).
Efficacy data from this phase 3 study  shows that median PFS with pomalido mide plus low-dose 
dexamethasone was 4.0 months (95% CI 3.6–4.7) versus 1.9 months (1.9–2.2) with high-dose 
dexamethasone (HR 0.48 [95% CI 0.39–0.60]; p<0.0001) favoring the pomalidomide plus low 
dose dexamethasone arm. The median overall survival was also significant ly longer in the 
pomalidomide plus low-dose dexamethasone group than in the high dose dexamethasone group 
(12.7 months [95% CI 10.4–15.5] vs 8.1 months [6.9–10.8]; HR 0.74 [0.56 –0.97]; p=0.0285). 
Overall response rate after a median follow-up of10.0 months was docum ented in 31% of 
302patients in the pomalidomide plus low-dose dexamethasone group versus 10% of 153 in the 
high-dose dexamethasone group (odds ratio [OR] 4.22 [2.35 –7.58]; p<0.0001). 
Regarding safet y, the most common grade 3 –4 hemat ologi cal adverse events in the pomalido mide 
plus low dose dexamethasone and high-dose dexamethason e groups were neutropenia (48% vs 
16% respectively), anaemia (33% vs 37%), and thrombocy topenia (22% vs 26%). Grade 3–4 
non-hematol ogical adverse events in the pomalidomide plus low-dose dexamethasone and

high-dose dexamethasone groups included pneumoni a (13% vs 8%), bone pain (7% vs 5%), and

The dose of pomalido mide in this study  will be 4 mg orally on Days 1 -21 of  each 28 day  cycle in 
combinat ion with low dose dexamethasone (40 mg/day on days 1, 8, 15, and 22, orally for patients

1.3.4 Rationale for combining Nivolumab and Pomalidomide in Multiple 
Myeloma 
The exact mechanism(s) needed to sensit ize BM T cells from  MM patients to PD-1 blockade is 
unknown but in part may require a reversal of T cell senescence that has been observed in MM19.
In fact, one report presents data supporti ng the capaci ty of low concentrati ons of  lenalido mide to 
improve several of the T cell abnorm alities of immunosenescence, suggest ing it may be a 
beneficial therapy  for restorati on of  T cell -dependent immunit y,especially  in the elderly which is 
the target demographic for most patients with MM. However, this observat ion has not been 
validated with T cells fro m the phenoty pes ascribed above to MM patients .19Therefore, in addit ion 
to the MoAs described for PD-1/PD -L1 blockade and IMiDs in restoring immune surveillance, 
perhaps IMiDs may also contribute to the reversal  of T cell  senescence a nd may at least parti ally 
sensit ize these co mpromised T cells to PD -1 blockade.
Due to the overlap in rationale for blocking PD -1 versus blocking PD -L1, m ost of  the pre -clinica l 
data supports that both approaches generate similar resul ts with regards to enhancing 
TandNKcell function and enhancing the killing of myeloma cells. However, there are some 
subtle yet distinct differences between these two approaches (Figure 1.3.4 -1). Blocking PD-1 
inhibits both PD-1: PD-L1 and PD-1: PD-L2 interacti ons. Antibodies directed toward PD-L1 
woul d block interacti ons wi th PD-1 but would not impair PD -L2interacti ons wi th PD-1.

Phase 2 Tri al of PD-1 Inhibitor with Pomalido mide in 3rd Line Myelo ma
An ongoing phase 2 study  single arm is evaluating the safet y and efficacy of a similar PD-1 
inhibitor (pembrolizumab) in combination with pomalidomide and low dose dexamethasone in 
relapsed/refractory  multiple myelo ma pat ients.
Of the first 24 pati ents, 75% had pri or autol ogous transplantation and 96% were refractory  to last 
therapy . All patientshad received both IMiD s and Proteosom e inhibitors; 75% were double 
refractory  to both IMiD s and Proteosom e inhibitors and additional 21% were refractory  to 
lenalido mide alone. Patients had received a median of 3 lines of prior th erapy  (range: 1-6). The 
median time fro m MM di agnosis to study  entry  was 4 years (range: 1.2 -15).
Preliminary safet y and efficacy data for the first 24 subjects demonstrated no infusio n-related 
reacti ons. Hematol ogic toxicities (grade 3) were neutropeni a (29%), lymphopenia (17%) and 
thrombocy topenia (8%). Non-hematol ogic adverse events included (Grade 2; 3): 
fatigue (n=12; 1), constipation (n=10; 0), dyspnea (n=9; 2), itching (n=6; 0), muscle spasms (n=6; 
0), infect ion(n=4; 3), hyperglycemia (n=5; 0), edema (n= 4; 0), fever(n=3; 0), palpitat ion(n=2 ; 
1), rash (n=3; 1) and hypotension (n=3; 0). Events of clinical significance, autoimmune mediated, 
included hypothy roidism (n=2), transaminit is (n=2), and pneumo nitis(n=1). Four patients had 
pomalidomide dose reductions due to rash, neutropenia, palpitations and fatigue. Two patients 
died; one af ter cy cle 1 (progressive disease) and one during cycle 2(sepsis). Objective responses 
(modified IMWG criteria) were observed in 11 of 22 evaluable patients (50%) including: near 
complete response (n=3), very good partial response (n=2), partial response (n=6); additionally, 
3patients had minimal response, 6 had stable disease and 2 progressed. At a median follow up of 
16 weeks; 17 of 22 patients continued on the study. 
Phase 1 Tri al of PD-1 Inhibitor with Lenalido mide in Myelo ma
Another ongoing phase 1 study  combining the PD1 inhibitor pembro lizumab with lenalido mide 
and dexamethasone in patients with relapsed/refractory  multiple myelo ma has demonstrated a 
tolerable safet y profile of the PD1 inhibitor and IMiDcombinat ion. Am ong the fi rst 17 evaluable 
subjects, sixteen (94%) experienced at least 1 adverse event (AE) of any grade related to study 
treatm ent and 10 (58%) experienced grade 3/4 treatm ent-related AEs. No death or treatm ent 
discontinuat ion for toxicity has been observed. The most frequent treatm ent-related AEs were: 
thrombocy topenia (47%), neutropenia (41%), fatigue (29%), and anemia, hyperglycemia, and 
muscle spasms (23% each). No DLTs were observed in the 10-mg lenalido mide coho rt. In the 
25-mg lenalido mide cohort, 3 patients (3/13) experienced a dose-limit ing toxicity (DLT): 
neutropeni a (grade 3 and grade 4), infectious pneum onia (grade 3), and tumor lysis syndro me 
(grade 3) with hyperuricemia (grade 4). All patients recovered from the DLTs without treatm ent 
discontinuat ion. Based upon these data the MTD/MAD was defined as pembro lizumab 200mg 
fixed dose in combinat ion with lenalido mide 25 mg and low-dose dexamethasone 40mg. The 
preliminary efficacy  was also promising in this study  with 76% ORR reported so far.

1.3.5 Rationale for combining Elotuzumab and Pomalidomide in Multiple 
Myeloma 
Combining elotuzum ab with lenalido mide, a thalido mide analog with immuno modulatory
properties, is well tolerated and was proven to result a statist ically and clinically meaningfu l 
improvement over lenalido mide/dexamethasone alone in a phase 3 trial. 
Pomalidomi de, in the same class as lenalido mide, is approved as a treatm ent option for subjects
with relapsed or refractory  multiple myelo ma who have received at least two prior therapi es
including lenalido mide and bortezomib and have demonstrated disease progression on or within
60days of co mpletion of the last therapy .
In in vit ro cellular assays, pomalidomide inhibited proliferat ion and induced apopto sis of
hematopoiet ic tumor cells. Addit ionally , pomalidomide inhibited the proliferat ion of
lenalido mide -resistant multiple myelo ma cell lines and synergized with dexamethasone in both
lenalido mide -sensi tive and lenalido mide -resistant cell lines to induce tumor cell apoptosis.
Pomalidomi de enhanced T cell-and natural  killer (NK) cell-mediated immunit y and inhibited
producti on of  pro-inflammatory cytokin es (e g, TNF -and IL -6) by  monocytes20.
Since pomalido mide may enhance the activit y of NK cells, which are central to the main biological 
activit y of elotuzum ab, combining both drugs is likely to enhance elotuzum ab-mediated 
antibody -dependent cell-mediated cytotoxi city (ADCC) towards primary myelo ma cells in a 
similar way  to that observed wit h lenalido mide.
Figure 1.3.5 -1illustrates resul ts from pre-clinical data (Robbins et al, unpublished) showing the 
combinat ion of elotuzum ab wi th pom alidomi de +/ -dexamethasone (SCID -ICR mice wi th OPM2 
xenograft) i s similar to the combination of elotuzumab and lenalidomide that has been previously 
reported21. Therefore, in pre-clinical models of M M, the combin ation of 
elotuzum ab/po malidomide enhances the killing of SLAMF7+ myelo ma cells in vivo greater than 
either agent alone. Addit ionally, low doses of dexamethasone do not appear to impair NK function 
in this model and adds to the anti -myelo ma act ivity of the combinat ion in this model.

1.3.6 Rationale for combining Elotuzumab and Nivolumab in Multiple 
Myeloma 
It has been previously shown in pre-clinical models that elotuzumab activit y towards MM cells 
can be improved by agents that enhance NK cell activity, either through agoni zing activating 
molecules or blocking inhibitory  molecules on the surface of NK cells22.Consistent with this 
rationale, PD -1 expressio n has been shown on both T cells and NK cells in bone marrow samples 
from MM patients, therefore blocking the PD-1/PD -L1 axis may also contribute to increased 
elotuzum ab activity towards killing myelo ma cells. Figure 1.3.6 -1shows that in pre-clinical  in 
vivo models, the combinat ion of elotuzum ab and a murine surrogate antibody of nivolumab 
demonstr ates enhanced reducti on of tumors in mice.23These resul ts were generated in a 
completely immune competent syngeneic mouse tumor model therefore the net anti -tumor activit y 
observed can be mediated by  both innate (NK) a nd adaptive (T cell) immunit y.

1.6 Product Development Background
1.6.1 Clinical Summary
1.6.1.1 Summary of Nivolumab Clinical Pharmacokinetics
The pharmacokinet ics (PK) of nivolumab were studi ed in subjects over a dose range of 0.1 to 
10mg/kg administered as a single dose or as mult iple doses of nivo lumab every 2 or 3 weeks. The 
geom etric mean (% CV%) clearance (CL) was 9.5 mL/h (49.7%), geometric mean volume of 
distribut ion at steady state (Vss) was 8.0 L (30.4%), and geom etric mean eliminat ion half-life 
(t1/2) was 26.7 days (101%). Steady -state concentrations o f nivo lumab were reached by 12 weeks 
when administered at 3 mg/kg Q2W, and systemic accum ulation was approximately  3-fold. The 
exposure to nivolumab increased dose proportionally over the dose range of 0.1 to 10mg/kg 
administered every 2 weeks. The clearance of nivol umab increased wit h increasing body  weight. 
The PPK analysis suggested that the fo llowing factors had no clinically important effect on the CL 
of nivo lumab: age (29 to 87 years), gender, race, baseline LDH, PD -L1. A PPK analysis suggested 
no difference in CL of nivo lumab based on age, gender, race, tumor type, baseline tumor size, and 
hepat ic impairment.
Although ECOG status, baseline glomerular filtratio n rate (GFR), albumin and body  weight had 
an effect on nivolumab CL, the effect was not clinically meaningful. Addit ionally, PPK and 
exposure response analyses have been performed to support use of 240mg Q2 W do sing in addit ion 
to the 3 mg/kg Q2W regimen. Using the PPK model, exposure of  nivo lumab at 240 mg flat dose 
was ident ical t o a dose of 3 mg/kg for subjects weighing 80 kg, which was the approximate media n 
body  weight in nivo lumab clinical trials (see Sect ion1.3.1.1 ).

1.6.1.2 Summary of Relevant Clinical Data
Nivo lumab Phase 1 Monotherapy  Resul ts in hematol ogical malignancies including Myelo ma
Preliminary safet y data f rom an ongoing Phase 1 study  for pati ents wi th a vari ety of hematol ogic 
malignancies (CA209039) suggested that the safety for these malignancies seems similar to that 
for solid tum ors. As of 02-May-2015, data were available for 105 patients, including 27 subjects 
with MM, treated with Nivo lumab monotherapy. Treatment with nivolumab in patients with 
hematol ogical malignancies has been well tolerated and toxicities have been generally 
manageable. There was 1 DLT (Dose Limit ing Toxi city) at the 1 mg/kg dose level in a patient

with multiple myelo ma who experienced Grade 3 pneumo nia and Grade 3 pneumo nitis. There was 
1 DLT at the 3 m g/kg dose l evel in a pat ient with small lymphocy tic lymphom a who experienced 
Grade 3 hy pereosinophilia and Grade 3 diplopia. The MTD was not reached.
Adverse events were reported in 104 of 105 (99%) patients and Grade 3 events in 64 (61%) 
patients. Related AEs were reported in 72 (68.6%) patients. Those that occurred in more than 5% 
of patients included: fat igue (16.2%), rash (10.5%), pneumonit is (9.5%), pruritus (9.5%), diarrhea 
(8.6%), py rexia (8.6%), decreased appetite (7.6% ), thrombocytopenia (6.7%), l eukopenia (5.7%), 
lymphopenia (5.7%), hypocalcaemia (5.7%) and lipase increased (5.7%). Related Grade 3 events 
were reported in 23 (21.9%) patients; the most commo n of which was leukopenia that occurred in 
4 (3.8%) patients. twenty  five (23.8%) patients discontinued therapy due to AEs, 15 of which were 
related to study  therapy. A total of 37 (35.2%) patients died: 28due to disease, 8 due to other 
causes, and 1 due to drug toxi city. Drug -related pneum onitis was observed in 10 patients (9.5%): 
Seven pat ients had Grade 1 or 2 pneumonit is; 2 had Grade 3; one patient had Grade 4.
Preliminary efficacy  results in 27 relapsed/refractory  multiple myelo ma patients have 
demonstrated stable disease amo ng 63% of patients with the remainder progres sion on single agent 
nivolumab.
1.7 Overall Risk/Benefit Assessment
Multiple myelo ma (MM) is the second most prevalent blood cancer after non -Hodgkin lympho ma, 
represent ing 10% of hematol ogic malignancies. While recent advances in the use ofhigh-dose 
chemotherapy, targeted therapeuti cs, and stem  cell transplantati on have improved overall and 
event -free survival, the majorit y of patients with myel oma will relapse and disease progressi on is 
expected for all but asmall percentage24. The subjects treated in this trial will receive an 
anti-myeloma regimen of pomalidomide + dexamethasone which dem onstrated improvements in 
PFS, overall survival, andoverall response in patients with refractory  or relapsed and refractory 
multiple myelo ma, including patients with disease refractory  to both bortezomib and 
lenalido mide25.
Pomalidomi dehas gained U.S. FDA and EMA approval  in this popul ation of MM patients at a 
dose of 4 mg, which is the dose being used in this trial.Pomalido mide is an analogue of 
thalido mide, which is known to cause severe life -threatening human birth defects. Because of this 
potenti al toxicity and to avoid fetal exposure, pomalido mide is only available under a special 
restri cted distributi on program Pomalyst REMS. Subjects must follow the local commercia l 
Pomalidomi de Pregnancy Risk Prevent ion Plan.  For th ose countries where local Pomalidomi de 
Pregnancy Prevent ion Program  does not exist, subjects must follow the Pomalido mide Global 
Pregnancy Prevent ion Plan for clinical trials(Appendix 6).All invest igators and subjects must 
fully comply with and participate in the pregnancy prevent ion program  in order to parti cipate in 
this trial.
Nivo lumab is approved in multiple solid tumor indicat ions based on its favorable benefit/risk 
assessment. In hematological malignancies including mult iple myelo ma, nivo lumab mo notherapy 
was generally well tolerated and toxicity profile was similar to that observed in solid tumors. 
Nivo lumab has the potential  for clinically relevant unique AEs potenti ally caused by an

inflammatory  mechanism. These include pulmo nary toxicity, hepatotoxicit y, diarrhea/co litis, 
endocrinopathies, and nephrotoxi city. To date, these unique AEs have been manageable with 
frequent monitoring, prom pt diagnosis, and initiation of corticosteroi ds, dose interrupti on, and 
adequate supportive care. The management algorithms of the immune related AEs are included in 
Appendix 5.
Emerging preliminary  data on safet y and efficacy  of the PD1 inhibitor pembro lizum ab in 
combinat ion with IMiDs (pom alidomide and lenalido mide) in relapsed/refractory  multiple 
myelo ma patients have demonstrated a clinical benefit and was well tolerated. Being a PD1 
inhibit or, nivolumab is expected to have an acceptabl e tolerance profile in combination with 
pomalidomide similar to that of pembro lizumab. 
Elotuzumab has proven activi ty in relapsed/refractory  multiple myelo ma patients in combinat ion 
with IMiD s. The addition of elotuzum ab to lenalido mide and low dose dexamethasone has 
signifi cantly pro longed the PFS compared to lenalidomide and low dose dexamethasone.
Elotuzumab as monotherapy  or in combinat ion with immunomodulatory  agents such as
thalido mide or lenalido mide is well tolerated. Safety data from theongoing rando mized phase 3 
study  of lenalido mide and dexamethasone with or without elotuzumab in pat ients with relapsed or 
refractory  multiple myelo ma (Eloquent 2) has shown thatelotuzumab was well tolerated in 
combinat ion with lenalido mide/dexamethasone, with minimal incremental toxicit y and no new 
safet y signals. The safet y profile of elotuzumab was consistent across IMiD combinat ion studi es 
(thalido mide and lenalido mide). Key elotuzum ab adverse events have been infusio n related 
events26.These have all been managed by medicat ions and resolved in less than24 hours. The 
frequency  and intensit y of infusio n related adverse events has been mit igated with prem edicati ons, 
including corticosteroi ds, histamine -1 and -2 antagonists, and acetaminophen. Guidelines for the 
management of infusi on reacti ons are al so provi ded in this protocol .
Since lenalido mide and pomalido mide are in the same class of drugs, and have a similar safet y and 
pharmacokinet ic profile, elotuzum ab is expected to elicit a similar safet y profile in combinat ion 
with pomalidomide as it did in the lenalido mide -elotuzumab and thalido mide -elotuzum ab 
combinat ions.
Because nivolumab and elotuzum ab have non-overl apping toxicity profiles, the combinat ion of 
both drugs with pomalidomide and dexamethasone is not expected to increa se toxi cities.
Based on the above assessment, the potenti al benefi t of combining nivolumab and elotuzum ab 
with pomalidomi de and dexamethason eappears to outwei gh the potenti al risk. The overall 
risk/benefit assessment supports the evaluat ion of these combi nations in this setting.
It is possible that unforeseen or unant icipated adverse events may  occur. In order to minimize the 
overall risks to participat ing subjects, the protocol has inclusio n-exclusion criteria appropriate to 
the popul ation, and specific follow-up safet y assessments. Adverse events and serious adverse 
events will be reviewed on an ongoing basis by the Medical Moni tor and the Sponsor’s 
pharmacovigilance group to look for trends and safety  concerns. Addit ionally, to ensure subjects’ 
safet y, an independe nt Data Monitoring Co mmittee (DMC) will also be established to monitor the

safet y of subjects treated with the combination regimens regul arly and ident ify any early safety 
signal.
Recent safet y concerns of increased risk of mortalit y and severe adverse events have been reported 
from two studi es with pembro lizumab, an anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody  not approved for 
treatm ent of m ultiple myel oma, in combinat ion with IMiD (l enalido mide and pomalido mide) and 
dexamethasone (https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/Dr ugSafet y/ucm574305.ht m). In light of these safet y 
concerns, on 1 September 2017 the FDA requested that CA209602 be placed on partial  clinical 
hold. As a consequence, as of 1- September -2017, enro llment in thisstudy  was stopped, as well as 
the cross -over ofsubjects rando mized to the Pd control  arm into the exploratory  NE-Pd arm. 
Subjects on treatm ent as of 1-September -2017 who were deriving clinical benefit can continue 
treatm ent and must be monitored as per protocol requi rements. As of Revised Protocol 02,the 
exploratory  NE-Pd arm  is rem oved from the study desi gn, and enrollment in the study  is focused 
on the investigational (N -Pd) and control  (Pd) arms. 
At FDA request, an interim PFS futility analysis based on the 12 -April -2018 database lock was 
perfor med t o compare PFS between NPd and Pd arms. Based on the results of this fut ility analysis, 
on 23- August -2018 Bristol -Myers Squibb (BMS) has decided to permanent ly discontinue 
enrollment in to the study due to insufficient evidence. The number of deaths tha t have occurred in 
the Arm NEPd (50%) were hi gher com pared to those in the Arm NPd (29%) and Arm Pd (23%). 
Three additional subjects in Arm Pd who crossed over to Arm NE-Pd havedied due to disease 
progression, result ing in a total of 19 (27%) deaths in A rm Pd. 
Amo ng all treated subjects, the rates of serious adverse events [SAE] were higher in patients in  
Arm N-Pd (58%) and Arm  NE-Pd (63%) compared to patients in Arm Pd (50%).
Deaths were mostly due to disease progressi on. Non-progression related causes of death are 
variable, with no dist inct pattern or unifying mechanism. One death due to study drug toxicit y was 
observed on the NPd arm due to pneumonit is complicated by pneumocyst is infection.

3 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN
3.1 Study Design and Duration
This is a phase 3 mu lticenter, randomized, open label study  designed to evaluate the clinical benefit  
and safety of the combinat ion therapy  of Nivolumab, pomalidomide, and dexamethasone (N-Pd 
the invest igational arm A), when com pared to pomalidomide and dexamethaso ne (Pd; the control 
armB) in subjects wi th relapsed and/or refractory  multiple myelo ma (rrMM). 
Up to Revised Protocol  01,the study  design included an exploratory  third arm evaluat ing the 
clinical benefit and the safet y of the combinat ion therapy of elotuzum ab, nivolumab, 
pomalidomide and dexamethasone (NE-Pd, the exploratory  arm-[arm C]) in the same patient 
popul ation. Addit ionally , subjects randomized to the Pd arm were allowed to cross over to this 
exploratory  NE-Pd arm at the time of progression. Cros s over was stopped as of 1 September 2017. 
Enrol lment in the NE-Pd exploratory  arm was stopped as ofRevised Protocol 02.All subjects 
already randomized to th e NE-Pd arm, or who crossed over from the Pd to th e NE-Pd arm will 
continue on study  as long as they have clinical benefit and do not m eet the study  discont inuat ion 
criteria. 
Initially, the study  was designed to enroll approximately 417 subjects for a total o f 348 subjects to 
be rando mized (assuming 20% screen failure rate) to N-Pd and Pd arms in a 1:1 ratio. 
Randomization wasperformed with the fo llowing stratificat ion factors: a) number of lines of prior 
therapy  (2 vs 3+); AND b) ISS stage (1- 2 vs 3).

Subjects were to continue treatm ent as long as the subject has clinical benefit from the treatm ent 
and does not meet criteria for treatment discont inuation.
As of 23 -August -2018, any addit ionalenrollment of CA209602 study was permanent ly closed due 
to the insufficient benefit observed based on the interim futility analysis of PFS. A total of 170 
subjects were rando mized into the study : 75 to NPd, 71 to Pd and 24 to NE-Pd arms. Subjects 
rando mized to the NPd or NEPd arms may continue treatment based on invest igator’s judge ment  
of continued clinical benefit. Study will be clo sed after all subjects complete safet y follow-up (i.e., 
100 day s after the l ast subject has discont inued study treatment).

3.3.3 Women of Childbearing Potential
Women of childbearing potenti al (WOCBP) is defined as any female who has experienced 
menarche and who has not undergone surgical sterilizat ion (hyste rectomy  or bilateral 
oophorectomy ) and is not postm enopausal . Menopause is defined as 12 m onths of  amenorrhea in 
a woman over age 45 years in the absence of other bio logical  or phy siological  causes. In addition, 
females under the age of 55 y ears must have a serum  follicle st imulat ing horm one, (FSH) l evel > 
40mIU/mL to confirm menopause.
*Females treated with horm one replacement therapy , (HRT) are likely to have artificially 
suppressed FSH levels and may requi re a washout period in order to obtain a physio logic 
FSH level. The duration of the washout period is a funct ion of the type of HRT used. The duration 
of the washout period below are suggested guidelines and the invest igators shoul d use their 
judgement in checking serum FSH levels. 
1 week minimum for v aginal horm onal products (rings, creams, gels)
4 week minimum for transdermal products
8 week minimum for oral products

Other parenteral products may require washout periods as long as 6 mo nths. If the serum FSH level 
is > 40 mIU/ml at any time during thewashout period, the wom an can be considered 
postm enopausal.
3.4 Concomitant Treatments
3.4.1 Prohibited and/or Restricted Treatments
Any systemic, anti-myelo ma therapy other thanthe study  drugs isprohibi ted while on study 
therapy . Concomitant steroids, other than weekly  dexamethasone or steroids allowed (as defined 
in eligibilit y criteria) are prohibi ted unless used to treat an adverse event. Guidelines for select ion 
and use of other concomitant medications shoul d be derived from the pomalidomide and 
dexamethasone prescribing informat ion. 
Avoid co-administration of pomalidomide with strong inhibitors of CYP1A2 unless medically 
necessary . Co-administration of pomalidomide with drugs that are strong inhibitors of CYP1A2 
(eg, cipro floxacin, enoxacin and fluvoxamine) and CYP3A4/5 (eg, ketoconazo le) or P-gp could 
increase pomalido mide exposure and shoul d be avoided, unless medically necessary,28, 29. The

Subjects are permitted the use of topical, ocular, intra-articular, intranasal, and inhalat ional 
corticosteroi ds (with minimal systemic absorpti on). Adrenal replacement steroi d doses > 10 mg 
daily  prednisone are permitted. A brief (less than 3 weeks) course of corticosteroi ds for 
prophylaxis (eg, contrast dye allergy) or for treatm ent of non-autoimmune condit ions (eg, delayed -
type hypersensit ivity reacti on caused by a contact allergen) is permitted
Per the ASCO 2007 Clinical Pract ice Guidelines30,bisphosphonate therapy  should be administered 
for a period of 2  y ears. At 2  years, the invest igator should seriously  consider discont inuing 
bisphosphonates in subjects with at least stable disea se, al though further use is at the discret ion of 
the invest igator.
Routine clinical pract ice for monitoring and prevent ion of osteonecrosis of the jaw 
(ie,comprehensive dental  exam, treating active oral  infect ions, eliminat ing sites of  high risks for 
oralinfection, excellent oral hygiene and avoiding invasive dental procedures while on treatment) 
must be fo llowed.
Erythropoi etin (EPO) or erythropoiesis st imulat ing agents (prior and ongoing use according to 
the package insert and inst itutional guidelines)

of Clinical  Oncol ogy guidelines (American Soci ety of Clinical  Oncology 2006).
3.4.4 Surgery and Radiation
Use of radiotherapy or surgical intervent ion must be recorded on the appropri ate Case Repor t 
Form .
Localized radiat ion therapy  to a site of pre-exist ing disease may be permitted while on study . 
Following approval  by the medical monitor, the subject may continue with protocol  therap y 
without interruption during the course of palliat ive radiat ion therapy  if the invest igator believes 
that the ri sk of  excessive bone marrow suppressio n or other toxi city is acceptable, and it is in the 
best interest of the subject to do so.
If the subject develops a definite increase in the size of existing bone lesions or soft tissue 
plasmacy tomas that m eets the criteria for disease progression (see Appendix 3) treatm ent m ust be 
discontinued for progressive disease regardl ess of whether radiat ion therapy  is initiated 
(Secti on3.5).
Kyphopl asty, vertebropl asty, or em ergency  orthopedi c surgery  is permi tted.

3.5 Discontinuation of Subjects following any Treatment with Study Drug 
Subjects MUST discont inue invest igational product (and non-invest igational product at the 
discreti on of  the invest igator) for any o f the following reasons:
Subject’s request to stop study  treatm ent
Progressive Disease according to IMWG criteria
Any clinical adverse event (AE), laboratory abnormalit yor intercurrent illness which, in the 
opinio n of the invest igator, indicates that continued participat ion in the study is not in the best 
interest of the subject
Terminat ion of the study  by Bristol -Myers Squibb ( BMS )
Loss of ability to freely  provide consent thro ugh imprisonment or involuntarilyincarceration 
for treatm ent of ei ther a psychiatric or physical (eg, infect ious di sease) illness
Subjects who receive any non-protocol  specified systemic anti-myelo ma therapy  before 
docum ented progression will be discont inued from all study treatment (including 
pomalidomide and dexamethasone); however, tumor assessments will continue at 4 week 
intervals until documented progression.
Subjects experi encing a Grade 4 infusion react ion related to elotuzumab must discontinue 
elotuzum ab only. Subjects may continue nivolumab, pomalidomide and dexamethasone 
treatment. Refer to Section 4.5.4 .
Subjects experiencing angioedema, Grade 4 rash, exfo liative or bullous rash, Stevens Johnson 
syndro me, or toxic epidermal necro lysis must discontinue pomalidomide and nivolumab . 
Subjects m aycontinue on el otuzum ab and dexamethasone.
Subjects experiencing a 56 day delay  in all study drugs (nivo lumab, pomalidomide, 
dexamethasone, and elotuzumab) due to an adverse event(s) related to study treatment must be 
discontinued from study  drug. Subjects experiencing delays unrelated to study  therapy, for 
example due to radiat ion therapy, may delay study treatment up to 84 days. Further delays ma y 
be allowed after discussio n with the BMS Medical Monitor.
Subjects experiencing a Grade 3 or 4 infusion react ion related to nivol umab must discontinue 
nivolumab only. Subjects may continue elotuzum ab, pomalidomide and dexamethasone 
treatm ent. Refer to Section 4.5.4 for addit ional reasons to discontinue nivolumab dosing 
perm anent ly.
In the case of pregnancy, the invest igator must immediately notify the BMS Medical 
Moni tor/desi gnee of this event and treatment with the IMPs would immediately be stopped .In 
most cases, the study drug will be permanent ly discontinued in an appropriate manner. Please call 
the BMS Medical  Monitor within 24 hours of awareness of the pregnancy. If the invest igator 
determines a possible favorable benefit/risk ratio thatwarrants continuat ion of study drug
(ie,allow ing restart of study drug if patient chose to terminate the pregnancy) , a discussio n 
between the invest igator and the BMS Medi cal Monitor/desi gnee must occur so permission can 
be granted.
All subjects who discont inue study  drug should comply with protocol  specified follow-up 
procedures as outlined in Section 5. The only excepti on to thisrequi rement is when a subject 
withdraws consent for all study  procedures including post -treatm ent study  follow-up or l oses the

a psy chiatri c or phy sical illness).
If study  drug is discont inued prior to the subject’s completion of the study , the reason for the 
discontinuat ion must be docum ented in the subject’s medical records and entered on the 
appropriate case report form (CRF) page.
3.6 Post Study Drug Stud y Follow up
PFS and OS are key endpo ints of the study . Post treatm ent study  follow-up is essent ial to 
preserving subject safet y and the integri ty of the study . Subjects who di scont inue study  treatm ent 
prior to progression must continue to be fo llowed for c ollecti on of protocol -defined PFS. Subjects 
who discont inue study  therapy must also continue to be followed for overall survival  data until 
death or the conclusio n of the study .
BMS m ay request that survival data be collected on all treated/randomized subj ects outsi de of  the 
protocol  defined window, Table 5.1 -3. A t the time of  this request, each subject will be contacted 
to determine their survival status unless the subject has withdrawn consent for all contacts or is 
lost to foll ow-up. 
3.6.1 Withdrawal of Consent
Subjects who request to discont inue study  drug will remain in the study  and must continue to be 
followed for protocol specified fo llow-up procedures. The only exception to this is when a subject 
specifically withdraws consent for any further contact with him/her or persons previously 
authori zed by subject to provide this informat ion. Subjects shoul d notify the investigator of the 
decisio n to withdraw consent from future follow-up in writing , whenever possible. The 
withdrawal  of consent shoul d be explained in detail in the medical records by  the invest igator, as 
to whether the withdrawal  is from further treatment with study  drug only or also from study 
procedures and/or post treatment study fo llow-up, and entered on the appropriate CRF page. In the 
event that vi tal status (whether the subject is alive or dead) is being measured, publicly available 
inform ation shoul d be used to determine vi tal status only as appropriately  directed in accordance 
with local law.
3.6.2 Lost to Follow -Up
All reasonable efforts must be made to locate subjects to determine and report their ongoing status. 
This includes follow-up wi th persons authorized by  the subjec t as noted above. Lost to fo llow-up 
is defined by the inabilit y to reach the subject after a minimum  of three docum ented phone calls, 
faxes, or emails as well as lack of response by subject to one registered mail letter. Allattem pts 
shoul d be documented in the subject’s medical records. If it is determined that the subject has died, 
the site will use permissible local methods to obtain the date and cause of death.
If investi gator’s use of third -party  representative to assist in the fo llow-up porti on of the study has 
been included in the subjec t’s inform ed consent, then the i nvest igator may use a Sponsor -retained 
third-party  representative to assist site staff with obtaining subject’s contact information or other 
public vital status data necessary to complete the follow -up porti on of the study. The site staff and 
representative will consult publicly available sources, such as public healt h registries and

4.1 Investigational Product
An invest igational product, also known as invest igational medicinal product in some regions, is 
defined a pharmaceut ical form of an active substance or placebo being tested or used as a reference 
in a clinical study , including products already with a market ing authorization but used or 
assembled (formulated or packaged) different ly than the authori zed form, or used for an 
unauthori zed indication, or when used to gain further information about the authorized form.
The invest igational product shoul d be stored in a secure area according to local regulat ions. It is 
the responsibilit y of the investigator to ensure that invest igational product is only dispensed to 
study  subjects. The invest igational product must be dispensed only from official study  sites by 
authori zed personnel according to local regulat ions.
In thi s protocol , investigat ional products are: nivolumab solution for IV i nfusi onand e lotuzumab 
powder for solution for infusi on.
4.1.1 Elotuzumab
Before administration the drug product should be stored and prepared as per the instructions in 
pharmacy manual or elotuzum ab invest igator brochure. The dose of elotuzum ab to be administered 
to a subject will be calcu lated by multiplying the subject’s weight (kg) by 10mg/kg (Cycles 1 
through 4) andby 20 mg/kg (Cycles 5 and beyo nd). The subject’s predose weight on Day 1 of 
each cycle will be used to calculate the dose for each cycle. Each dose should be infused as per
instructi ons in the elotuzum ab invest igator brochure. The infusio n start and stop time will be 
recorded in the CRF. If the infusio n is stopped mid -session for any reason, the stop/start time must  
be recorded together with an explanat ion.
4.1.2 Nivolumab
Nivo lumab will be administered at a dose of 240 mg as an intravenous infusio n over 30 minutes 
every 2 weeks (Days 1 and 15 of each 28 day cycle) during Cycles 1 through 4. Starting Cycle 5 
and beyo nd, nivolumab will be administered at a dose of 480 mg as an intravenous infusi on over 
30 minutes every 4 weeks (Day 1 of each 28 day cycle) .Please refer to the nivo lumab invest igator 
brochure and/or pharmacy manual for guidelines on drug preparation and administrati on.Flush

4.2 Non-Investigational Product
Other medications used as support or escape medication for preventative, diagnosti c, or therapeutic 
reasons, as components of the standard of care for a given diagnosis, may be considered as 
non-invest igational products.
In this protocol , non-investigational product(s) are: Pomalido mide (Pom alyst) capsules 1mg, 
2mg, 3 mg, and 4 mg, dexamethasone tablets and concentrate for solution for IV infusio n, or 
products used for Elotuzum ab prem edicati on (Secti ons4.5.1.3. 6 and 4.5.1.3. 7) or

4.2.1 Pomalidomide
Pomalidomi de is an analogue of thalido mide. Thalidomide is a known human teratogen that causes 
severe life-threatening human birth defects. If pomalidomide is taken during pregnancy , it may 
cause birth defects or death to an unborn baby. Females must not get pregnant: (1)for at least 
4weeks before starting pomalido mide, (2)while taking pomalido mide, (3)during any 
interrupti ons in pomalidomide treatm ent and (4)for at least 4 weeks after their last dose of 
pomalidomide. Furtherm ore, subjects taking pomalido mide shoul d refrain from donating blood 
(until at least 90 days) or sperm (unt il at least 4 weeks ) after last dose of pom alidomide. 
Because of this potenti al toxicity and to avoid fetal exposure to pomalido mide, pomalidomide is 
only available under a special restricted distribut ion program . Each risk management program is 
country  or region specific. Under these programs, only prescribers and pharmacists registered with 
the program can prescribe and dispense the product. In addition, pomalido mide must only be 
dispensed to subjects who are registered and meet all the condi tions of the local pomalido mide 
risk management program or meet all the condi tions of the Pomalidomide Pregnancy  Risk 
Prevent ion Plan(Appendix 6). Subjects who have the potenti al of pregnancy must be instructed 
about contraception and undergo the scheduled pregnancy tests. 
Subjects shoul d not break, chew or open the capsules. Pomalidomi de shoul d be taken in 
accordance with local label .
WOCBP must have negat ive pregnancy  testing and use contracepti on methods before initiating 
pomalidomide.
The trade name of pomalido mide may vary in other countries. In such cases, refer to country trade 
name.
4.2.2 Dexamethasone
Dexamethasone tablets and so lution for IV infusio n isconsidered Non-IP/Non -IMP for this study. 
Marketed product will be utilized for this study  and shoul d be stored in accordance with the 
package insert or summary of product characterist ics (SmPC).
4.3 Storag e and Dispensing
The product storage manager shoul d ensure that the study  drug is stored in accordance with the 
environmental condi tions (temperature, light, and humidit y) as determined by BMS. If concerns 
regarding the qualit y or appearance of the study d rug arise, the study drug should not be dispensed 
and contact BMS immediately.
Procedures for proper handling and disposal o f anticancer drugs should be considered.
Study  drug not supplied by  BMS need to be stored in accordance with the package insert.
Investigational product documentation (whether supplied by BMS or not) must be maintained that 
includes all processes requi red to ensure drug is accurately administered. This includes 
docum entati on of drug storage, administration and, as applicable, storage temperatures, 
reconstitution, and use of required processes (eg, required diluents, administration sets).

4.4 Method of Assigning Subject Identification
4.4.1 Subject Identification
Subjects will be ident ified and informed consent obtained. Subjects must be enro lled into the study 
by the interactive web response system  (IWRS) to obtain the subject number. The following 
inform ation is required for subject enrollment:
Date of Birth
Site number
Date that informed consent was ob tained
Once it has been determined that a subject is eligible for rando mizat ion, the site will enter in to the 
IWRS to obtain the treatment assignment. Subjects will be rando mized to pomalido mide + 
dexamethasone + nivolumab (N-Pd invest igational arm) or pomalido mide + dexamethasone 
(PdControl arm) in a 1:1 rati o. The rando mizat ion will be carried out via perm uted bl ocks wi thin 
each stratum and stratified by the fo llowing factors:
a)number of lines of prior therapy  (2 vs 3+)
b)ISS stage (1 -2 vs. 3)
Addit ional details will be included in the IWRS manual including instructions for subjects at the 
time of cross -over to NE -Pd.

Consult the Medi cal Moni tor for further guidance regarding alternat ive premedicat ions fo r subjects 
allergic or intol erant to any  premedicat ion or to determine if locally used equivalent medications 
are acceptable.
On weeks of elotuzum ab infusio n, the dexamethasone dose will be split into a PO and IV 
administration which will also serve as premedicatio n for elotuzum ab.
Intravenous and PO dexamethasone doses are calculated to provide a total dose that is 
bioequivalent to an oral dose of 40 mg (subjects who are 75 years old) or 20 mg (in subjects who 
are > 75 y ears ol d). (Dexam ethasone 8 m g IV i s approximately  bioequivalent to 11 mg PO).
In addition, the following must also be administered 45 to 90 minutes before initiating the 
elotuzum ab:
H1 blocker: diphenhydramine (25 - 50 mg po or IV) or equivalent
H2 blocker: ranit idine (50 m g IV) or equivalent (eg, 150 mg po)
Acetaminophen (650 -1000 mg po).

Subjects with Grade 4 infusio n react ion, see Secti on 4.5.2.1.3.
4.5.2 Manageme nt of Infusion Reactions
4.5.2.1 Guidelines for Elotuzumab Infusion in Subjects with Infusion Reactions
4.5.2.1.1 Grade 1 Infusion Reaction
For Grade 1 elotuzum ab infusio n-related reactions, by definit ion, do not require intervent ion. 
However, increased monitoring is reco mmended.
4.5.2.1.2 Grade 2 or 3 Infusion Reaction
Infusion reactions during the elotuzumab infusion : For a Grade 2 or 3 elotuzum ab 
infusio n-related reacti on, the infusio n must be interrupted. The subject shoul d be treated as 
clinically indicated with one or more of  the following medicat ions or intervent ions: antiemetics, 
antihistamines, analgesics, corticosteroids, leukotriene inhibitors, oxygen inhalat ion, epinephrine, 
bronchodilators, or other supportive measures as indicated.
Once the elotuzum ab infusio n-related reaction has resolved to Grade 1, the infusio n can be 
restarted at 0.5 mL/minute. If symptom s do not recur after 30minutes, the infusio n rate may be 
increased in a stepwise fashio n (0.5 mL/minute every  30minutes or per investigator’s discretion ) 
to the rate at which the infusio n react ion occurred. If no recurrence of the infusio n react ion, the 
escalat ion regimen according to the table above can be resumed.
Subjects who experience an infusio n reaction require vital signs to be monitore d every 30 minutes 
for 1 or 2 hours after the end of the elotuzumab infusio n (or as clinically indicated per 
investigator’s discret ion). If the elotuzumab infusio n react ion recurs, the infusio n must be stopped 
and not restarted on that day . Appropri ate the rapy shoul d be administered to address the subject’s 
signs and symptoms. The infusio n can be reattempted at the next protocol defined infusio n time 
point at the invest igator’s discretion wit h additional premedicati on as described in Table 4.5.1.3 -
5.
Infusion reactions after the completion of elotuzumab infusion : Should a Grade 2or 3infusio n 
reacti on occur following completion of an elotuzumab infusio n, the subject shoul d be treated as 
above.
Elotuzumab infusions on subsequent weeks after a prior Grade 2 or 3 infusion reaction : 
Subjects with a priorGrade 2 or 3 infusio n react ion during Cycle 1 shoul d have the subsequent 
infusio n started at 0.5 mL/min. The infusio n rate may be escalated in a stepwi se fashion 
(0.5mL/minute every 30minutes) to the rate at which the infusio n react ion occurred. If no 
Grade 2 infusio n reacti on occurs, the escalati on regimen may be resumed and the next infusi on 
may be init iated as pl anned per the regimen.
Contact the Medical Monitor with any quest ions regarding elotu zumab infusio n rate escalat ion.

Acute symptom s shoul d be managed as described in Section 4.5.2.1.2 . Elotuzumab must be 
perm anent ly discont inued. Subjects may continue with nivolumab, pomalido mide and 
dexamethasone per protocol.
4.5.2.1.4 Treatment of Nivolumab -Related Infusion Reactions
Since nivolumab contains only human immunoglobulin protein sequences, it is unlikely to be 
immunogenic and induce infusio n or hy persensi tivity react ions. However, if such a reaction were 
to occur, it might manifest with fever, chills, rigors, headache, rash, pruri tus, arthal gias, 
hypotension, hypertensio n, bronchospasm, or other allergic -like react ions. All Grade 3 or 
4infusio n reactions should be reported within 24 hours to the study medical mo nitor and reported 
as an SAE if it meets the criteria. Infusio n react ions shoul d be graded according to NCI CTCAE 
(Versi on 4.0) gui delines.
Treatment recommendations are provi ded below and may be modified based on local treatment 
standards and guidelines, as appropriate:
For Grade 1symptom s: (mild react ion; infusion interrupti on not indicated; intervent ion not 
indicated):
Remain at bedside and monitor subject until recovery  from symptom s. The following 
prophylact ic prem edicati ons are recommended for future infusio ns: diphenhydramine 50 mg 
(or equivalent) and/or acetaminophen/paracetamol 325 to 1000 m g at l east 30 minutes before 
additional nivo lumab administrations.
For Grade 2 symptoms: (moderate reaction required therapy or infusio n interruption but responds 
prom ptly to symptomat ic treatm ent (eg, antihistamines, non-steroi dal anti-inflammatory drugs, 
narcoti cs, corticosteroi ds, bronchodilators, IV fluids); prophylact ic med ications indicated for 
24hours):
Stop the nivo lumab infusio n, begin an IV infusion of normal saline, and treat the subject with 
diphenhydramine 50 mg IV (or equivalent) and/or acetaminophen/paracetamo l 325 to 
1000 mg; remain at bedside and monitor subj ect u ntil resolution of symptom s. Corti costeroi d 
and/or bronchodilator therapy  may also be administered as appropriate. If the infusio n is 
interrupted, then restart the infusio n at 50% of the original infusio n rate when symptoms 
resolve; if no further co mplications ensue after 30 minutes, the rate may be increased to 100% 
of the original infusio n rate. Monitor subject closely . If symptom s recur, then no further 
nivolumab will be administered at that visit.
For future infusio ns, the following prophylacti c prem edications are recommended: 
diphenhydramine 50 mg (or equivalent) and/or acetaminophen/paracetamo l 325 to 1000 mg 
shoul d be administered at least 30 minutes before nivolumab infusio ns. If necessary , 
corticosteroi ds (up to 25 m g of SoluCortef or equivalent) ma y be used.

solution for subcutaneous administration or 0.1 to 0.25 mg of a  1:10,000 solution injected 
slowly for IV administration, and/or diphenhydramine 50mg IV with methylpredniso lone 
100mg IV (or equivalent), as needed. Subject shoul d be monitored until the Investi gator is 
comfortable that the symptoms will not recur ,nivolumab will be perm anently discont inued. 
Invest igators should follow their institutional guidelines for the treatm ent of anaphyla xis. 
Remain at bedside and monitor subject until recovery  of the symptoms.
In case of late-occurring hypersensit ivity symptoms (eg, appearance of a l ocalized or generalized 
pruri tus within 1 week after treatm ent), symptomat ic treatment may be given (eg, oral 
antihistamine or corticosteroids).
4.5.3 Management Algorithms for Immune Related Adverse Events
Immuno-oncol ogy (I-O) agents are associated with AEs that can differ in severit y and durati on 
than AEs caused by other therapeuti c classes. Nivo lumab is considered an immuno -oncol ogy agent 
in this protocol . Early recogni tion and management of AEs associ ated with immuno -oncol ogy 
agents may mitigate severe toxicity. Management Algorithms have been devel oped to assist 
investigators in assessing and managing t he fo llowing groups of AEs:
Gastrointestinal
Renal
Pulmo nary
Hepati c
Endocrinopathy
Skin
Neurol ogical
The above al gorithms are found in Appendix 5 and in the nivo lumab Invest igator Brochure.
4.5.4 Dose Delay, Interruption, or Discontinuation, All Subjects
If the dose of one drug in the regimen (ie, pomalido mide, dexamethasone, nivolumab or 
elotuzum ab) is interrupted, or discont inued, the treatm ent with the other drugs may continue as 
scheduled. However, if dexamethasone is interrupted or discontinued discuss o ngoing elotuzumab 
administration with the medical mo nitor (applicable for NE -Pd arm only).
Each cycle is 28 days. While dose delays (within the allowed window determined below for 
nivolumab and elotuzum ab) or interruptions are permitted, the start of each cycle cannot be 
delayed and is fixed (ie, anchored) relative to Cycle 1 Day 1. Adjustments to the Cycle1 Day 1 
anchored schedule should not be perform ed. Should the start of a cy cle be delayed, it is expected 
the following cy cle begin as anchored to Cycle 1 Day  1. For example, if a subject is unable to start 
Cycle (X) until 3 days after the anchored start date, all assessments shoul d be recorded on Cycle

shoul d be skipped, not delayed, if not given wit hin the allowed window.
Subjects may continue on study  therapy even if components of the study  therapy must be 
discontinued.
Please consult the BMS Medical Moni tor or any questions regarding dose interruption or study
therapy  discont inuat ion.
4.5.4.1 Elotuzumab
In Cycles 1 to 2, elotuzum ab doses that fall outsi de of  the pre-specified window of -1to3days 
must be skipped.
Beginning with Cycle 3 and beyo nd, elotuzum ab dosing may be delayed for up to 1 week. If unable 
to admin ister within 1 week, then the dose shoul d be skipped and resumpt ion of the elotuzum ab 
continues per the protocol defined schedule.
Subjects experi encing a Grade 4 infusio n react ion related to elotuzum ab must permanent ly 
discontinue elotuzumab.
4.5.4.2 Dexamethason e
Dexamethasone interrupti on shoul d be performed as clinically indicated at the discret ion of the 
investigator.
For subjects receiving elotuzumab, the weekly dexamethasone that coincides wit h or is temporally 
closest to the next elotuzum ab dosing must be administered as part of the prem edicati on for 
elotuzum ab per the guidance inSecti on4.5.1.3.2 .
4.5.4.3 Pomalidomide
Pomalidomi de interrupti on shoul d be performed as clinically indicated at the discreti on of the 
investigator.
Subjects shoul d be instructed that if a dose of pomalidomide has been missed and it has been less 
than 12 hours since the subject’s regular dosing time, to take pomalido mide as soon as the subject 
remembers. If i t has been m ore than 12 hours, the dose m ust be ski pped. Subjects shoul d not take 
2doses at the same time .
4.5.4.4 Nivolumab
For subj ects being dosed in the nivolumab 240 mg Q2W part of  the study , they may be dosed no 
less than 12 days from the previ ous dose. Nivo lumab can be delayed within a 3 day window of 
Day 1 and Day  15 as l ong as the 12 day  interval  between 2 nivo lumab 240 m g doses is respected. 
Doses that fall outside the allowed window should be skipped.
For subjects being dosed in the nivo lumab 480 mg Q4W part of the study, for the first dose, it ma y 
be dosed no less than 12 days from the previous dose and for subsequent doses it should be dosed 
no less than 21days fro m the previous dose. Nivo lumab can be delayed wit hin a 7 day window of 
Day 1 as l ong as the 12 day  and 21 day  intervals for the first 480 mg dose and subsequent 480 mg

5.1.1 Retesting During Screening or Lead -in Period
Retesting of laboratory  parameters and/or other assessments within any single screening will be 
permitted (in addit ion to any  parameters that require a confirmatory  value).
Any new result will override the previous resul t (ie, the mo st current result prior to Randomizat ion) 
and is the value by which study  inclusio n will be assessed, as it represents the subje ct’s most 
current, clinical state.
Laboratory  param eters and/or assessments that are included in Table 5.1 -1, Screening Procedural 
Outline may be repeated in an effort to find all possible well -qualified subjects. Consultation with 
the Medi cal Moni tor m ay be needed to i dentify  whether repeat testing of any part icular parameter 
is clinically  relevant.

5.3 Safety Assessments
Only data for the procedures and assessments specified in this protocol  should be submi tted to 
BMS. Addit ional procedures and assessments may be performed as part of standard of care; 
however, the data for these assessments should remain in the subject’s medical record and should 
not be provided to BMS, unless specifically requested from the Sponsor. Safet y assessments must 
be done prior to dosing. The local safety labs (com plete blood coun t, chemistry panel ) and 
procedures m ay be collected or perform ed up to 3 days pri or to the visi t. For subjects who ski p a 
dose, l ocal safet y labs results must be collected at least once pe r cycle. 
All subjects will be assessed for safet y. Safety evaluations include assessments of AEs, clinical 
laboratory  tests (hematology , chemistry ), vital sign measurements, and physical examinat ion wit h 
assessment of ECOG PS. Invest igators are responsible for monitoring the safet y of subjects who 
have entered this study  and for alerting the Sponsor to any  event that seem s unusual , even if this 
event may be considered an unant icipated benefit  to the subject. The invest igator is responsible 
for appropri ate m edical care of subjects during the stu dy.

5.3.1 Assessment sfor the Study
Any incidental findings of potenti al clinical relevance that are not direct ly associated with the 
objectives of the protocol  should be evaluated and handled by the Study  Investigator as per 
standard m edical/clinical judgment.
5.3.2 Vital Signs, Physical Measurements, and Physical Examination
Vital signs (body  temperature, seated blood pressure, heart rate will be recorded as outlined in 
Table 5.1-1, Table 5.1-2,Table 5.1-3, andTable 5.1-4. Blood pressure and heart rate shoul d be 
measured after the subject has been seated qui etly for at l east 5 minutes prior to dosing. Subjects 
will have vital signs measured once at each visit. Subjects ran domized to the NE-Pd arm will have 
additional vital signs during Cycle 1 only, as fo llows: 
Prior to pre -medication administrati on
Prior to the start of the elotuzumab infusio n
Thirty minutes after the start of elotuzum ab infusio n
At the end of the elotuzumab infusio n
Post infusio n vital signs will be measured at 30 minutes.
Subjects who experience a Grade 2 infusion react ion require vital signs to be mo nitored every 
30 minutes for 1 - 2 hours after the end of the elotuzum ab infusio n (at the invest igator’s 
discreti on).
Weight will be measured at study visits as indicated in Table 5.1 -1, Table 5.1 -2,Table 5.1 -3, Table 
5.1-4.
A full physical examinat ion will be performed at the screening visit, whereas a targeted exam will 
occur at Day 1 and during on-treatm ent up to 3 days prior to d osing and post-treatm ent visits. A 
targeted physical examinat ion may be performed by a qualified professional guided by the 
examiner’s observat ions and/or subject complaints on new or changed condi tions, symptom s, or 
concerns. Targeted phy sical exam includes assessment of heart, lung, and abdo men.
5.3.3 Performance Status
Perform ance assessment will be performed as indicated in Table 5.1-1, Table 5.1-2,Table 5.1-3, 
andTable 5.1-4using ECOG performance scale and criteria as described in Appendix 2. The 
assessment shoul d be completed prior to any study -related procedures, treatm ent or clinicia n 
assessment.
5.3.4 Cardiac Assessments

5.4 Efficacy Assessments
Efficacy endpoints will be based on analysis o f serum and ur ine electrophoresis (SPEP and UPEP), 
sFLC (for those wi th sFLC only disease ), corrected cal cium (serum calcium and serum albumin), 
imaging and bone marrow assessments, all at predefined intervals as specified in Table 5.1-1, 
Table 5.1-2,Table 5.1-3andTable 5.1-4. Assessments done at local labs versus central  labs are 
indicated in Table 5.1 -1, Table 5.1 -2, Table 5.1 -3, and Table 5.1 -4. Assessments for SPEP, UPEP 
and sFLC will be based on central lab results, whereas assessments of bone marrow, bone lesio ns, 
extram edullary  plasmacy tomas, and corrected calcium will be based on local analysis at the site.
5.4.1 Primary Efficacy Assessment
IMWG Response criteria in Appendix 3will be used for the efficacy analysis. For the purposes of 
this study , all subjects’ tumor assessments by myelo ma laboratory  tests (SPEP M protein and 
UPEP M protein quant ificat ion, corrected calcium (calcium and albumin), and serum free light 
chain) should be re -evaluated per the protocol -stated frequency relat ive to the date of first dose of 
study  drug until confirmed disease progression based on Appendix 3, irrespective of dose delays 
or treatm ent cycle. If subject does not have documented disease progression as defined in 
Appendix 3at the time of study drug discontinuation, then disease assessments must continue 
to be performed according to the same schedule described above until confirmed disease 
progression even if a subsequent anti-myeloma treatment is initiated prior to disease 
progression confirmation . Subjects will be followed every 12 weeks, or more frequent ly, after 
disease progressi on for survival, subsequent myelo ma therapy , and devel opment of second 
primary  malignancy.
All efficacy  laboratory  assessments (SPEP, UPEP, serum/urine immunofixat ion, and sFLC) 
shoul d be done through the central laboratory, except corrected calcium (serum calcium and seru m 
albumin), and bone marrow assessments for plasma cell percentag e and light chain restri ction 
(clonali ty by IHC or flow cytometry). All bone marrow aspirate and core biopsy samples for

disease assessment shoul d be assessed locally .  
For any  SPEP, UPEP, or 
sFLC assessment performed locally, in lieu of a central  lab assessment, (ie, if the subject cannot 
complete a visit at the study siteafter treatm ent discontinuat ion), M protein abso lute quantificat ion 
(eg, g/dL or g/L) or sFLC (eg, mg/L or mg/dL) must be performed. Any laboratory  samples 
analyzed locally, including for efficacy, must be entered on the appropriate CRF/eCRF as 
requested by  the Sponsor to properly assess efficacy  per protocol  criteria.
5.4.2 Labo ratory Assessments for Myeloma
All laboratory  efficacy assessments must be perform ed until confirmed disease progressi on or 
withdrawal of consent, even if the subject is discont inued fro m study  therapy  and has started new 
myelo ma therapy . Confirmat ion of PR and PD is requi red on 2 consecutive assessments .
Elotuzumab may be detected in the serum  protein electrophoresis (SPEP) and serum 
immunofixat ion assays of myeloma patients and could interfere with correct response 
classificat ion.A small  peak in the earl y gamma region on SPEP that is IgGƙ on serum 
immunofixat ion may potentially be attributed to elotuzum ab, particularly in patients whose 
endogenous myelo ma protein is IgA, IgM, IgD, or lambda light chain restricted. This interference 
can impact the determ ination of complete response and possi bly relapse from complete response 
in patients with IgG kappa myelo ma protein. It is likely  that nivolumab may also be detected by 
SPEP and immuno fixation but this is st ill under investigation. Serum  or peripheral bloo d samples, 
collected during the study, may be analyzed for the presence of mo noclonal  antibody  interference.
1)Serum : SPEP for M protein quant ificat ion, total serum  protein, serum  immuno fixation, and 
quant itative immunoglobulin assay .
a.Serum  Immuno fixation (IFE) is requi red at baseline and to confirm CR regardl ess of 
whether measurable M -protein was present at baseline.
b.Subjects with measurable disease in SPEP will be assessed for response based on SPEP 
and not by  the serum  FLC assay .
c.Subjects with measurable disease in both SPEP and UPEP will be assessed for response 
based on these two tests and not by the serum FLC assay .
d.Subjects wi th FLC only  disease (i.e. serum  and urine IFE negative )shou ld be monitored 
by sFLC only; SPEP, UPEP and IFE are required only to code CR in those subjects
e.Subjects with measurable disease by sFLC only, but with non-measurable serum  M-
protein, will be monitored by sFLC assay for response. However, thei r SPEP shoul d also 
be monitored for progression. 
2)Serum free light chain (sFLC) : 
a.Subjects without measurable serum M -protein (i e, < 0.5 g/dL (5 g/L)) or urine M -protein 
(ie,<200 m g (0.2 g) per 24 hours) and with measurable invo lved sFLC are considered 
oligosecretory and must have s FLC assessed at each cycle until confirmed progres sion.
Please note that SPEP and UPEP should st ill be followed in those patient s.
b.In subjects with measurable disease in serum &/or urine,  sFLC must be assessed atime 
of serum  and urine IFE negativit yto assess for sCR
3)Urine : 24-hour urine collect ion forM protein quant ification and immuno fixation. 24-hour

Disease assessments for CR/sCR confirmation will be performed at the local lab. These include 
but are not limited to plasma cell percentage and light chain restri ction, per IMWG criteria (See 
Appendix 3).

5.4.3 Imaging Assessments for Myeloma
5.4.3.1 Skeletal Survey
Skeletal survey , by conventi onal radiography , for metastati c disease will be performed within 
28days of rando mizat ion in all subjects. Skeletal survey will be performed on study  if clinically 
indicated (development of com pressi on fracture does not excl ude response). Use of conventi onal 
or low dose CT scan (i e, of the spine) or MRI bone survey  is acceptable. If imaging is perform ed 
on treatm ent for assessment of progression, the site must use the same modalit y of imaging as used 
in screening. The number and location of skeletal lesions and whether they are lytic shoul d be 
recorded on the eCRF. On treatm ent survey shoul d record whether there is an increase in the
number or size of ly tic lesions.
5.4.3.2 Assessment of Extramedullary Plasmacytoma
Com puted tomography  or MRI should be performed at screening, if clinically  indicated or if 
patient had a previous extramedullary  or bone pl asmacy toma. To minimize unnecessary radia tion 
in myelo ma subjects where progression is primarily based on serum and urine M -protein, on study 
assessments shoul d only be performed if clinically  indicated (ie, pain, concern for disease

progression), whether or not present at baseline . In subjects w ith baseline plasmacyto ma, imaging 
follow-up shoul d be done regul arly per invest igator’s discretion . Imaging confirmat ion of 
disappearance of plasmacy toma is requi red at time of CR/sCR if it was not confirmed before .
A sum of the products of the longest diameters and longest perpendicular diameter for all 
measurable lesions will be calculated at screening. This sum will be used as the reference for on 
study  assessments by  which to characteri ze the objective tumor response.
All tumor measurements must be made in millimeters. All docum ented measurable and 
non-measurable lesions are to be followed throughout the trial. All assessments to be used for 
tumor response evaluati on, including the baseline assessment, m ust be perf ormed using the same 
method for repeat assessment. CT and MRI scanning are the preferable methods of assessment. 
Conventional CT and MRI shoul d be performed with contiguous cuts of 10mm or less or with 
cuts of 5  (or 10) mm if spiral CT scanning is used. Imaging- based evaluat ion is preferred to 
evaluat ion by clinical examinat ion. Evaluat ion by chest x-ray is less preferable than CT or MRI, 
and should only be used for well -defined lesio ns surrounded by aerated lung. Clinical examinat ion 
is only acceptable when lesio ns are superficial, such as a skin nodule or palpable lymph node. Skin 
lesions must be docum ented by a photograph with a ruler. Ultrasound is not acceptable for 
docum entati on of  measurable disease.
Duplicate copies o f all imaging studies used for tumor response evaluat ion will be made available 
for review by the Sponsor upon request.
Measurable disease are lesio ns that can be accurately measured in 2 dimensio ns and both diameters 
must be 20 mm when evaluated by standard CT scanning or 10 mm when evaluated by spiral 
CT scanning or MRI. The minimum diameter size should be at least twice the slice thickness.
Non-measurable disease are all other lesio ns (or sites of disease), including those that are too small 
(ie, do not meet above criteria), occur within a previously irradiated area (unless they are 
docum ented as new lesio ns since the completion of radiation therapy), bone lesions, 
leptom eningeal disease, ascites, pleural or pericardial effusi on (exception for effusions 
docum ented by cytology as not malignant or present at baseline wi thout progression), lymphangit is 
cutis/pulm onis, abdominal masses that are not pathol ogically/cy tologically confi rmed and 
followed by imaging techniques, and cyst ic lesio ns.
5.4.4 Definitions of Response and Progression Criteria
See Appendix 3for definit ions ofresponse and progression. All criteria are derived from 
IMWG32,33,34. All response and progressi on categori es require 2 consecutive assessments to 
confirm response and progression before init iation of any new therapy.
NB: Table in Appendix 3 is inclusive ofmultip leresponse category  definit ions; however, the 
protocol /CRF is not reporting on all of these response categori es.

5.9 Results of Central Assessments
All efficacy  laboratory  assessments shoul d be perform ed by the central  laboratory . Invest igative 
site staff will receive reports of the results on an ongoing basis for treatment decisio ns and patient  
manage ment throughout the study. If the invest igator chooses to perform any addit ional serum and 
urine myelo ma lab tests locally, the results must be reported in the CRF .
6 ADVERSE EVEN TS
An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any new untoward medical occurrence or worsening of a 
preexist ing medical condi tion in aclinical invest igation subject administered study  drug and that 
does not necessarily have a causal  relationship with this treatm ent. An AE can therefore be any

unfavorable and unint ended sign (such asan abnormallaboratory  finding ), symptom , or disease 
temporally  associ ated with the use of study  drug, whether or not considered related to the study 
drug.
The causal relat ionship to study drug is determined by a physician and should be used to assess all 
advers e events (AE). The ca usal relati onship can be one of the fo llowing:
Related: There is a reasonable causal  relationship between study  drug administration and 
the AE.
Not related: There is not a reasonable causal  relationship between study  drug 
administration and the AE.
The term "reasonable causal relat ionship" means there is evidence to suggest a causal relat ionship. 
Adverse events can be spontaneously reported or elicited during open -ended quest ioning, 
examinat ion, or evaluat ion of a subject . (In order to prevent reporting bias, subjects should not be 
questioned regarding the specific occurrence of one or more AEs.)
BMS will be reporting adverse events to regulatory authorit ies and ethics committees according to 
local applicable laws includin g European Directive 2001/20/EC and FDA Code of Federal 
Regulations 21 CFR Parts 312 and 320.
6.1 Serious Adverse Events
A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose :
resul ts in death
is life-threatening (defined as an event in which the subject was at risk ofdeath at the time of 
the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothet ically might have caused death if it were 
more severe)
requi res inpat ient hospitalizat ion or causes prolongation of exist ing hospitalizat ion (see NOTE 
below)
resul ts in persistent or significant disabilit y/incapaci ty
is a congenital ano maly/birth defect
is an important medical event (defined as a medical event(s) that may not be immediately 
life-threatening or result in death or hospitalizat ion but, based upon appropriate medical and 
scientific judgment, may jeopardi ze the subject or may requi re intervent ion [eg, medical, 
surgi cal] to prevent one of the other serious outcomes listed in the definit ion above.) Examples 
of such events include, b ut are not limi ted to, intensive treatm ent in an em ergency room  or at 
home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsio ns that do not result in 
hospi talizati on.) Potenti al drug induced liver injury  (DILI) is also considered an important 
medical event. (See Section 6.6for the definit ion of potenti al DILI.)
Suspected transmission of an infectious agent (eg, pathogenic or nonpathogenic) via the study  drug 
is an SAE.

Although pregnancy , overdose, cancer, and potent ial drug induced liver injury (DILI) are not 
always serious by regulatory definit ion, these events must be handled as SAEs. (See Section 6.1.1
for reporting pregnancies).
Any component of a study endpo int that is consider ed related to study therapy (eg, death is an 
endpo int, if death occurred due to anaphylaxis, anaphylaxis must be reported) shoul d be reported 
as SAE (see Section 6.1.1 for reporting details ).

The fo llowing hospi talizati ons are not consi dered SAEs in BMS clinical studies:
a visit to the emergency room or other hospital department < 24 hours, that does not result 
in admissio n (unless considered an important medical or life -threatening event)
elective surgery, planned prior to signing consent
admissio ns as per protocol for a planned medical/surgical procedure
routi ne healt h assessment requiring admissio n for baseline/trending of health status 
(eg,routine co lonoscopy )
medical/surgical admissio n other than to rem edy ill healt h and planned pri or to entry  into 
the study . Appropri ate docum entati on is requi red in these cases
admissio n encountered for another life circumstance that carries no bearing on health status 
and re quires no medical/surgical interventi on (eg, lack of  housing, economic inadequacy, 
caregiver respi te, family ci rcumstances, administrative reason )
Admissio n for administration of anticancer therapy  in the absence of any other SAEs 
(applies to oncology  protocols)
6.1.1 Serious Adverse Event Collection and Reporting
Secti ons 5.6.1 and 5.6.2 of the nivo lumab and elotuzumab Invest igator Brochure (IB) containsthe 
Reference Safety Informat ion to de termine expectedness of serious adverse events for expedited 
reporting . Following the subject’s written consent to participate in the study , all SAEs, whether 
related or not related to study drug, must be collected, including those thought to be associ ated 
with protocol -specified procedures . All SAEs must be collect ed that occur during the screening 
period and within 100 days of discont inuat ion of dosing or within 30 days of the last visit for 
screen failures. For subjects rando mized and never treated with study  drug, SAEs shoul d be 
collected for 30 days fro m the dat e of rando mizat ion.
The investigator must report any SAE that occurs af ter these time periods and that is believed to 
be related to study  drug or protocol -specified procedure. 
The investigator mustreport any SAE that occurs after these time periods and that is believed to 
be related to study  drug or protocol -specified procedure. 
An SAE report mustbe completed for any event where doubt exists regarding its seriousness. 
If the invest igator believes that an SAE is not related to study drug, but is potent ially related to the 
condi tions of the study  (such as withdrawal of previous therapy  or a complicat ion of a  study 
procedure), the relat ionship mustbe specified in the narrative section o f the SAE Report Form.

SAEs, whether related or not related to study  drug, and pregnancies must be reported to BMS 
(ordesignee) within 24 hours of awareness of the event. SAEs must be recorded on the SAE Report 
Form; pregnancies on a Pregnancy Surveillance Form  (electroni c or paper forms). The preferred 
method for SAE data reporting collection is through the eCRF. The paper SAE/pregnancy 
surveillance forms are only intended as a back -up option when the eCRF system is not functioning.
In this case, the paper forms are to be transmitted via email or confirmed facsimile (fax) 
transmissio n to:
SAE Email Address: Refer to Contact Informat ion list.
SAE Facsimile Number: Refer to Contact Informati on list.
For studies capturing SAEs through electronic data capture (EDC), electroni c submissi on is the 
requi red method for reporting. Inthe event the electroni c system  is unavailable for transmissio n, 
paper forms must be used and submitted immediately. When paper forms are used, the original 
paper form s are to rem ain on si te.
SAE Telephone Contact (required forSAE and pregnancy reporting): Refer to Contact
Inform ation list.
If only limited informat ion is initially available, follow -up reports are required. (Note: Foll ow-up 
SAE reports mustinclude the same invest igator term(s) init ially reported.) 
If an ongoing SAE changes in its intensity or relationship to study drug or if new informat ion 
beco mes available, the SAE report must be updated and submitted within 24 hours to BMS 
(ordesignee) using the same procedure used for transmitt ing the init ial SAE report.
All SAEs must be followed to resol ution or stabilization.
A SUSAR (Suspected, Unexpected Serious Adverse React ion) is a subset of SAEs and will be 
reported to the appropriate regulatory  authori ties and invest igators following local and global 
guidelines and require ments.
6.2 Nonserious Adverse Events
Anonserious adverse event is an AE not classified as serious.
6.2.1 Nonserious Adverse Event Collection and Reporting
The collect ion of nonserious AE informat ion should begin at init iation of study drug until 100 days 
from the last dose of study drug. Nonserious AE inform ation shoul d also be collected from the 
start of a placebo lead -in per iod or other observat ional period intended to establish a baseline status 
for the subjects.
Nonserious AEs shoul d be followed to resol ution or stabilizat ion, or reported as SAEs if they 
beco me serious (see Section 6.1.1 ). Follow-up is also requi red for nonserious AEs that cause 
interrupti on or d iscont inuat ion of study drug and for those present at the end of study treatment as 
appropriate. All ident ified nonserious AEs must be recorded and described on the nonseri ous AE 
page of the CRF (paper or electronic).

6.4 Pregnancy
If, following initiation of the study  drug , it is subsequent ly discovered that a study subject is 
pregnant or m ay have been pregnant at the time of study  exposure, including during at least time 
to washout plus one ovulatory cycle ( 30 days) for a total of 23 weeks , or plus one spermatogenesis 
cycle (90 days) for a total  of 31 weeks after product administration (for pati ents in arms A and C; 
4 week duration needed for arm B), the investigator must immediately notify the BMS Medical 
Moni tor/desi gnee of this event and co mplete and forward a Pregnancy Surveillance Form to BMS 
Designee within 24 hours of awareness of the event and in accordance with SAE reporti ng 
procedures described in Secti on6.1.1 .Refer to pomalidomide pregnancy  risk preventi on plan f or 
additional information (Appendix 6). 
In most cases, the study drug will be permanent ly discontinued in an appropriate manner (eg, dose 
tapering if necessary  for subject safet y).Please call  the BMS Medical  Moni tor wi thin 24 hours of 
awareness o f the pregnancy .
The invest igator must immediately notify  the BMS (or designee) Medical Moni tor of  this event

6.5 Overdose
An overdose is defined as the accidental or intent ional administrati on of any dose of a product that 
is considered both excessive and medically important. All occurrences of overdose must be 
reported as an SAE (see Secti on6.1.1 for reporting details.).
Of note, doses up to 20mg/kg of elotuzumab and doses of up to 10mg/kg of nivo lumab have been 
safely administered in prior studies. 
6.6 Potential Drug Induced Liver Injury (DILI)
Wherever possible, timely confi rmation of initial liver-related laboratory  abnormalit ies shoul d 
occur prior to the reporting of a potential DILI event. All occurrences of potential DILIs, meet ing 
the defined criteria, must be reported as SAEs (see Section 6.1.1 for reporti ng details).
Potenti al drug induced liver injury  is defined as: 
1.AT (ALT or AST) elevation > 3 times upper limit of normal (ULN )
AND
2.Total  bilirubin > 2 times ULN, wit hout init ial findings o f cholestasis (elevated serum alkaline 
phosphatase)
AND
3.No other immediately apparent possible causes of AT elevat ion and hyperbilirubinemia, 
including, but not limi ted to, vi ral hepatitis, pre -exist ing chronic or acute liver disease, or the 
administration of other drug(s) known to be hepatotoxic.
6.7 Other Safety Considerations
Any significant worsening noted during interim or final physical examinat ions, electrocardiogram, 
x-ray filming ,any other potenti al safet y assessment required or not required by protocol  should 
also be recorded as a nonserious or serious AE, as appropr iate, and reported accordingly.
Second primary malignancies (SPMs) will be collected throughout the study  which includes 
assessments during survival  follow-up. All SP Ms that occur during thescreening period and within 
60days of discontinuation of dosing will be reported as an SAE regardless of relat ionship to study 
drug. Addit ionally , any  SPM that occurs after this ti meframe and considered related to study drug 
will be reported as an SAE. All other SPMs will be collected and reported on a separate CRF page.
Immune-mediated adverse events (IMAEs) are AEs consistent with an immune -mediated
mechanism or immune -mediated co mponent for which non -inflammatory  etiologies (eg, infect ion
or tum or progressi on) have been ruled out. IMAEs can include events with an al ternate etiology
which were exacerbated by the induct ion of autoimmunit y. Informat ion supporting the assessment
will be co llected on the subject’s case report form.

7 DATA MONITORING COMM ITTEE AND OTHER EXTE RNAL 
COMMITTEES
An independent data monitoring co mmittee (DMC) will be established before the first subject is
treated to provide oversight of safet y and study conduct. The DMC will review safet y and efficac y 
data at periodic intervals.
The first comprehensive safet y review will occur after the first 42 treated subjects (ie,the first 
6subjects in the exploratory arm) have been fo llowed for 1 month
An independent review commit tee (IRC) had been set up to review blinded responses and 
progression criteria in each subject. However, after enrollment was discont inued, it was decided 
to discont inue efficacy assessment by IRC.
Separate charter swill provide further guidance an d describe the activit ies of the secommit tees.
8 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS
8.1 Sample Size Determination
Prior to Revised Protocol 02, the study  planned to rando mize 406 subjects at a 3:3:1 ratio to N -Pd 
vs Pd vs NE-Pd. Also, subjects random ized to the Pd control arm were allowed to cross -over to 
the expl oratory  NE-Pd arm  upon progressi on. As of  1 September 2017, cross -over wasno longer 
permitted and as of Revised Protocol 02, the explo ratory  NE-Pd arm  was cl osed to enrollment.
In Revised Protocol  02, the planned sample size for thi s study  was revised toapproximately 348 
rando mized subjects rando mized at a 1:1 ratio to N-Pd vs Pd. The sample size o f the study accounts 
for the primary  efficacy endpoint of PFS. PFS will be evaluated for treat ment effect at the overall 
alpha level of 0.05 (two -sided) with 90% power with twointerim analys es, with the first one for 
early  futility and the second for efficacy .
The study requires at least 262 PFS events to ensure that a two-sided 5% type I error sequent ial 
test procedure with twointerim analys es will have 90% power to detect a hazard ratio (HR) of 
0.667, corresponding to a median PFS of 6 vs 4 months for the N-Pd and Pd arms, respect ively.
East versi on 6.3 was used for sample size/power computation.

8.3 Endpoints
8.3.1 Primary Endpoint
The primary  object ivesin the study  will be measured by  the primary  endpoint of PFS assessed by 
investig atorwithin the N- Pd an d Pd arms.
8.3.1.1 Progression Free Survival
PFS is defined as the time from randomization to the date of the first documented tumor 
progression or death due to any cause. PFS will be determined by an invest igator, based upon 
laboratory  data (eg,SPEP/IFE, UPEP/IFE, bone marrow disease assessment, serum  FLC) as 
defined bythe IMWG criteria.Subjects who die without a reported prior progression will be 
considered to have progressed on the date of their death. Subjects who did not progress or die wi ll 
be censored on the date of thei r last efficacy assessment. Subj ects who di d not have any  on study 
efficacy  assessments and di d not di e will  be censored on the date they  were randomized. Subjects 
who started any subsequent anti-cancer therapy  without a prior reported progression will be 
censored at the last efficacy assessment prior to subsequent anti -cancer therapy .

OS will be censored on the last date a subject was known to be alive. 
Object ive Response Rate (ORR) 
Object ive response rate is defined as the proporti on of rando mized subjects who achieve a best 
overall response of stringent complete response (sCR) , com plete response (CR), very good partial 
response (VGPR), or partial response (PR) using the IMWG criteria.
Time to Response (TTR)
Time to Response (TTR) is defined as the time from the date of  rando mizat ion to the date of the 
first sCR, CR, VGPR, or PR. TTR will be evaluated for responders (BOR is either sCR, CR, 
VGPR, or PR) only .
Durati on of  Response (DOR)
Durati on of  Response (DOR) is defined as the time between the date of first response to the date 
of the first objectively docum ented tumor progress ion as assessed by independent review 
committee according to modified IMWG criteria or death due to any cause prior to subsequent 
anti-cancer therapy. Subjects who neither progress nor die will be censored on the date of their last  
tumor assessment prior t o subsequent anti-cancer therapy. DOR will be evaluated for responders 
(BOR i s either sCR, CR, VGPR, or PR) only .
8.3.3 Exploratory Endpoint(s) 
Within the NE-Pd arm, the following endpo ints are considered as exploratory  endpo ints, ORR ,
PFS, DOR, and TTR by  investigator .
For subjects who cross ed-over from the control  arm(Pd) to the exploratory  arm (NE-Pd), the 
following endpo ints are considered as exploratory efficacy  endpo ints, ORR, PFS, DOR, and TTR

8.5 Interim Analyses
Interim Analysis for PFS Futilit y 
At FDA’s request on 21- June-2018, a formal PFS interim analysis for futilit y was conducted in 
August 2018 based on the database lock on 12 -April-2018. The investi gator assessed progression 
events (NPd and Pd arms) were used in this analysis. Prior to runni ng the fut ility analysis, a fut ility 
criteria was defined based on condit ional power assuming 85 events (30% informat ion fraction).  
The stoppi ng criteria for futility was that the condi tional power under observed trend is strictly 
less than 1%. This woul dcorrespond to a HR (NPd vs. Pd) boundary  of 0.995 and the 
corresponding condit ional power under al ternat ive would be 67.8%, ie if alternat ive hypothesis is 
true (HR = 0.667), there is st ill 67.8% chance that the study  will be posi tive at the final analysis. 
Subsequently, after conducting the interim analysis, the decisi on was made to permanently 
discontinue enrolment based on insufficient clinical benefit observed at an interim fut ility analysis 
for PFS. All futility analyses were conducted by  the unblind ed independent statistics vendor.

9.1 Compliance
9.1.1 Compliance with the Protocol and Protocol Revisions
The study  shall be conducted as described in this approved protocol . All revisi ons to the protocol 
must be discussed with, and be prepared by, BMS. The invest igator should not implement any 
deviat ion or change to the protocol without prior review and docum ented approval/favorable 
opinio n from the IRB/IEC of an amendment, except where necessary to eliminate an immediate 
hazard(s) to study  subjec ts. 
If a deviat ion or change to a protocol is implemented to eliminate an immediate hazard(s) prior to 
obtaining IRB/IEC approval/favorable opinio n, as soon as possible the deviat ion or change will be 
submitted to:
IRB/IEC for review and approval/favorabl e opinio n
BMS
Regulatory  Authori ty(ies), if required by  local regul ations
Docum entati on of approval signed by the chairperson or designee of the IRB(s)/IEC(s) must be 
sent to BMS.
If an amendment substant ially alters the study  design or increases the pote ntial risk to the subject: 
(1) the consent form must be revised and submi tted to the IRB(s)/IEC(s) for review and 
approval /favorable opinio n; (2) the revised form must be used to obtain consent from subjects 
currently enrolled in the study  if they are affe cted by the amendment; and (3) the new form must 
be used to obtain consent from new subjects prior to enrollment.
If the revisio n is done via an administrati ve letter, investi gators m ust inform  their IRB(s)/IEC(s).
9.1.2 Monitoring
BMS representatives will revie w data centrally to identify potential issues to determine a schedule 
of on-site visi ts for targeted revi ew of study  records. 
Representatives of BMS must be allowed to visit all study  site locati ons peri odically to assess the 
data qualit y and study  integrity. On site they will review study records and directly co mpare them 
with source docum ents, discuss the conduct of the study  with the invest igator, and verify that the 
facilit ies remain acceptable. CRF pages and/or electronic files may serve as the source documents:
such as outcome assessments.
In addit ion, the study may be evaluated by BMS internal auditors and government inspectors who 
must be allowed access to CRFs, source documents, other study files, and study  facilit ies. BMS 
audit reports will be kep t confident ial.
The investigator must notify BMS prom ptly of any inspect ions scheduled by regulatory authori ties, 
and prompt ly forward copi es of  inspect ion reports to BMS.

9.1.2.1 Source Documentation
The Investi gator is responsible for ensuring that the source data are accurate, legible, 
contemporaneous, ori ginal  and attributable, whether the data are hand -written on paper or entered 
electroni cally. If source data are created (first entered), modified, maintained, archived, retrieved, 
or transmitted electroni cally via computerized systems (and/or any other kind of electronic 
devices) as part of regulated clinical trial activities, such system s must be compliant with all 
applicable laws and regulati ons governing use of electronic records and/or electronic signatur es. 
Such systems may include, but are not limited to, electronic medical/healt h records (EMRs/EHRs), 
adverse event tracking/reporting, protocol  required assessments, and/or drug accountabilit y 
records).
When paper records from such systems are used in plac e of electronic format to perform regulated 
activit ies, such paper records should be certified copies. A certified copy  consists of a copy of 
original  informat ion that has been verified, as indicated by a dated signature, as an exact copy 
having all o f thesame attri butes and informat ion as the original. 
9.1.3 Investigational Site Training
Bristol-Myers Squibb will provi de quali ty invest igational staff training prior to study  initiation. 
Training topics will include but are not limited to: GCP, AE reporting, stu dy details and procedure,

9.2.3 Case Report Forms
An investigator is required to prepare and maintain adequate and accurate case histories designed 
to record all observat ions and other data pertinent to the invest igation on each individual treated 
or entered as a control in the invest igation. Data that are derived from source documents and 
reported on the CRF must be consistent with the source documents or the discrepancies must be 
explained. Addit ional clinical informat ion may be collected and analyzed in an effort to enhance 
understanding o f product safe ty. CRFs may  be requested for AEs and/or laboratory  abnorm alities 
that are reported or ident ified during the course of the study .
For si tes using the BMS electronic data capture tool, electronic CRFs will be prepared for all data 
collect ion fields except for fields specific to SA Es and pregnancy, which will be reported on the 
electroni c SAE form and Pregnancy Surveillance f orm, respectively .If electroni c SAE form is not 
available, a paper SAE form can be used. Spaces may be left blank only in those circumstances 
permitted by  study -specific CRF co mpletion gu idelines provided by BMS . 
The confidentialit y of records that could ident ify subjects must be protected, respecting the privacy 
and confidentialit y rules in accordance wi th the applicable regulato ry requi rement(s).
The invest igator will maintain a signature sheet to document signatures and init ials of all persons 
authori zed to m ake entri es and/or corrections on CRFs. 
The co mpleted CRF, SAE/pregnancy CRFs, must be pro mptly reviewed, signed, and dat ed by the 
investigator or qualified physician who is a subinvesti gator and who is delegated thi s task on the 
Delegati on of Authori ty Form.For electronic CRFs, review and approval /signature is completed 
electroni cally through the BMS electroni c data captur e tool . The invest igator must retain a copy 
of the CRFs including records of the changes and corrections.
Each individual electronically signing electronic CRFs must meet BMS training requirements and 
must only access the BMS electronic data capture tool u sing the uni que user account provi ded by 
BMS . User accounts are not to be shared or reassigned to other individuals.

APPENDIX 1 DEFINITION OF L INES OF THERAPY
Line of Therapy (from Internati onal Myel oma Working Group (Raj kumar, 2011)) is defined as 
one or more cycles of a planned treatment program . This may consist of one or more planned 
cycles of single -agent therapy  or combinat ion therapy, as well as a sequence of treatm ents 
administered in a planned manner. For example , a planned treatm ent approach of induct ion 
therapy  followed by autol ogous stem  cell transplantati on, followed by maintenance is considered 
one line of therapy . Each subsequent line of therapy  starts when a planned course of therapy is 
modified to include other treatm ent agents (alone or in combinat ion) as a resul t of disease 
progression, relapse, or toxicity. A new line of therapy also starts when a planned period of 
observat ion off therapy  is interrupted by  a need for addi tional treatm ent for the disease.

APPENDIX 3 DEFINITIONS OF RESPONSE AND PROGRESSION CRITERIA
NB: The table below is inclusive of multiple response category definitions; however, the  
protocol/CRF is not reporting on all of th ese response categories. The standard IMWG  
response criteria have been limited to the eligible patient population in the study.
Table 1: IMWG criteria for response assessment including criteria for 
minimal residual disease
Response SubcategoryResponse criteriaa
IMWG MRD criteria (requires a complete response as defined below)
Sustained MRD-
negativeMRD negativity in the marrow (NGF or NGS, or both) and by imaging as defined 
below, confirmed minimum of 1 year apart. Subsequent evaluations can be used to 
further specify the duration of negativity (eg, MRD-negative at 5 years)b
Flow MRD-negativeAbsence of phenotypically aberrant clonal plasma cells by NGF on bone marrow 
aspirates using the EuroFlow standard operation procedure for MRD detection in 
multiple myeloma (or validated equivalent method) with a minimum sensitivity of 1 
in 10⁵nucleated cells or higher1
Sequencing MRD-
negativeAbsence of clonal plasma cells by NGS on bone marrow aspirate in which presence of 
a clone is defined as less than two identical sequencing reads obtained after DNA 
sequencing of bone marrow aspirates using the LymphoSIGHT platform (or validated 
equivalent method) with a minimum sensitivity of 1 in 10 ⁵nucleated cells or higher
Imaging-positive MRD-
negativeMRD negativity as defined by NGF or NGS plus disappearance of every area of 
increased tracer uptake found at baseline or a preceding PET/CT or decrease to less 
mediastinal blood pool SUV or decrease to less than that of surrounding normal 
tissuec
Standard IMWG response criteria
Stringent complete
responseComplete response as defined below plus normal FLC ratio and absence of clonal 
cells in bone marrow biopsy by immunohistochemistry ( κ/λ ratio ≤4:1 or ≥1:2 forκ 
and λ patients, respectively, after counting ≥100 plasma cells)d
Complete responsee Negative immunofix ation on the serum and urine and disappearance of any soft tissue 
plasmacytomas and < 5% plasma cells in bone marrow aspirates
Very good partial 
responseeSerum and urine M-pro tein detectable by immunofixati on but not on electrophoresis 
or ≥90% reduction in serum M-protein plus urine M-protein level < 100 mg per 24 h
Partial response≥50% reduction of serum M-protein plus reduction in 24 h urinary M-protein by 
≥90% or to < 200 mg per 24 h;
If the serum and urine M-protein are unmeasurable, a ≥50% decrease in the difference 
between involved and uninvolved FLC levels  is required in place of the M-protein 
criteria;
If serum and urine M-protein are unmeasurable, and serum-free light assay is also 
unmeasurable, ≥50% reduction in plasma cells is required in place of M-protein,
provided baseline bone marrow plasma-cell percentage was ≥30%. In addition to 
these criteria, if present at baseline, a ≥50% reduction in the size (SPD)fof soft tissue

plasmacytomas is also required
Minimal response25% but 49% reduction of serum M -protein and reduction in 24- h urine M -protein 
by 50 –89%. In addition to the above listed criteria, if present at baseline, a 50% 
reductio n in the size (SPD)fof soft tissue plasmacytomas is also required
Stable diseaseNotrecommended for use as an indicator of response; stability of disease is best 
described by providing the time -to-progression estimates. Not meeting criteria for
complete response, very good partial response, partial response, minimal response, or 
progress ive disease
Progressive diseasegAny one or more of the following criteria:
1.Increase of 25% from lowest confi rmed response value in one or more of the 
following criteria:
a)Serum M -protein (absolute increase must be 0.5 g/dL);
b)Serum M -protein increase 1g/dL, if the lowest M component was 5 
g/dL;
c)Urine M -protein (absolute increase must be 200 mg/24 h);
d)In patients without measurable serum and u rine M -protein levels, the 
difference between involved and uninvolved FLC levels (absolute increase 
must be >10 mg/dL);
2.Appearance of a new lesion(s), 50% increase from nadir in SPDfof > 1 lesion, 
or 50% increase in the longest diameter of a previous lesion > 1 cm in short 
axis;
IMWG=International Myel oma Working Group. MRD=minimal residual disease. NGF= next-generation flow. 
NGS=next -generation sequencing. FLC=free light chain. M -protein=myeloma protein. SPD=sum of the products of 
the maximal perpendicular diameters of measured lesions. FCM=flow cytometry . SUV max=maximum standardised 
uptake value. MFC=mul tiparameter flow cytometr y. 18F-FDG PET=18F -fluorodeoxyglucose PET. 
aAll response categories require two consecutive assessments made any time before starting any new 
therapy ; for MRD there is no need for two consecutive assessments, but information on MRD after each 
treatment stage is recommended (eg, after induction, high-dose therapy /ASCT, consolidation, maintenance). 
MRD tests should be initiated only at the time of suspected complete response.  All categories of response and 
MRD require no known evidence of progressive or new bone lesions if radiographic studies were performed. 
However, radiographic studies are not required to satisfy  these response requirements except for the requirement 
of FDG PET if imaging MRD -negative status is reported. Each category, except for stable disease, will be 
considered unconfirmed until the confirmatory test is performed. The date of the initial test is considered as the 
date of response for evaluation of time dependent outcomes such as duration of response.
bSustain ed MRD negativity  when reported should also annotate the method used (eg, sustained flow MRD -
negative, sustained sequencing MRD -negative).
cCriteria used by Zamagni and colleagues,2and expert panel (IMPetUs; Italian Myeloma criteria for PET Use).3, 4
Baseline positive lesions were identified by presence of focal areas of increased uptake within bones, with or 
without any underlying lesion identified by CT and present on at least two consecutive slices. Alternatively, an 
SUVmax=2·5 within osteolytic CT areas >1 cm in size, or SUVmax=1·5 within osteolytic CT areas 1 cm in 
size were considered positive. Imaging should be performed once MRD negativity  is determined by MFC or 
NGS.

dPresence/absence of clonal cells on immunohistochemistry is based upon the //L ratio. An abnormal κ/λ ratio 
by immuno histochemistry requires a minimum of 100 plasma cells for analysis. An abno rmal ratio reflecting 
presence of an abnormal clone is κ/λ of > 4:1 or < 1:2.
eWhen the only method to measure disease is by serum FLC lev els: complete response can be defined as a normal 
FLC ratio of 0·26 to 1·65 in addition to the complete response criteria listed previously. Very good partial 
response in such patients requires a 90% decrease in the difference between involved and uninvo lved FLC 
levels
fPlasmacy toma measurements should be taken from the CT portion of the PET/CT, or MRI scans, or dedicated CT 
scans where applicable. For patients with only skin involvement, skin lesions should be measured with a ruler. 
Measurement of tumou r size will be determined by the SPD
gPositive immunofixatio n alone in a patient previously classified as achieving a complete response will not be 
considered progression. In the case where a value is felt to be a spurious result per physician discretion (eg, a 
possible laboratory error), that value will not be considered when determining the lowest value.

APPENDIX 5 NIVOLUMAB MANAGEMENT ALGORITHMS
These general guidelines const itute guidance to the Investi gator and may be supplemented by 
discussio ns with the Medical Moni tor representing the Sponsor. The guidance applies to all 
immuno -oncol ogy agents and regimens.
A general princi ple is that different ial diagnoses shoul d be diligen tly evaluated according to 
standard medical pract ice. Non-inflammatory  etiologies shoul d be considered and appropriately 
treated.
Corti costeroi ds are a primary therapy for immuno -oncol ogy drug-related adverse events. The 
oral equivalent of the recommended IV doses may be considered for ambulatory  patients with 
low-grade toxi city. The lower bioavailabilit y of oral corti costeroi ds shoul d be taken into account 
when switching to the equivalent dose of oral corticosteroids.
Consultat ion with a medical or surgi cal specialist , especially prior to an invasive diagnostic or 
therapeuti c procedure, is recommended.
The frequency and severit y of the rel ated adverse events covered by  these algori thms will  depend 
on the immuno -oncol ogy agent or regimen being used.

APPENDIX 6 POMALIDOMIDE PREGNAN CY RISK PREVENTION P LAN
Appendix 6only applies to participants in certain countries or regions.
All participants must follow either the local pomalidomide risk management program or the 
Pomalidomi de Pregnancy Risk Preve ntion Plan.
1 POMALIDOMIDE PREGNANCY PREVENTION PLAN FOR SUBJECTS IN
CLINICAL TRIALS
The Pregnancy Preventi on Plan (PPP) applies to all subjects receiving pomalido mide within a 
clinical trial. The fo llowing PPP documents are included : 
1.The Pomalidomide Risks of Fetal Exposure, Pregnancy Testing Guidelines and Acceptable 
Birth Control  Methods docum ent (Section 2) provides the fo llowing informat ion:
Potenti al risks to the fetus associated with pomalidomide exposure
Definit ion of Female of Childbearing Potenti al (FCBP) / female not of childbearing 
potenti al (FNCBP)
Requi rements for counseling of all subjects receiving pomalidomide about pregnancy 
precauti ons and the potential risks of fetal exposure to pomalido mide
Acceptable birth control methods for both female subjects of childbearing potenti al and 
male subjects receiving po malidomide in the study
Pregnancy testing requirements for subjects receiving pomalido mide who are FCBP
2.The Pomalidomide Educat ion and Counseling Guidance Docum entfor each gender (female 
and male (Secti on3and Section 4respect ively) must be completed and signed by a trained 
counselor at the participat ing clinical center prior to each dispensing of pomali domide.  A 
copy  of this docum ent m ust be maintained in the subject’s records for each dispense.
3.The Pomalidomide Informati on Sheet (Section 4) will be given to each subject receiving 
pomalidomide. The subject must read thi s doc ument pri or to s tarting pom alidomide and each 
time the subject receive sa new supply of pomalidomide .

2 POMALIDOMIDE RISKS O F FETAL EXPOSURE, PR EGNANCY TESTING 
GUIDELINES AND ACCEP TABLE BIRTH CONTROL MET HODS 
2.1 Risks Associated with Pregnancy
Pomalidomi de was teratogenic in both rats and rabbits when administered during the period of 
organogenesis. Pomalido mide is an analogue of thalido mide. Thalido mide is a known human 
teratogen that causes severe life-threatening human birth defects. If pomalido mide is taken 
during pregnancy, it can cause birth defects or death to an unborn baby.
The teratogeni c effect of pomalidomide in humans cannot be ruled out. Therefore, a pregnancy 
prevent ion program  must be fo llowed.
2.1.1 Definition of Females of C hildbearing Potential (FC BP)
A FCBP is a female who: 1) has achieved menarche at some point, 2) has not undergone a 
hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy or 3) has not been naturally  postm enopausal 
(amenorrhea following cancer therapy does not rule out childbearing potenti al) forat least 24 
consecut ive months (ie, has had menses at any  time in the preceding 24 consecut ive months).
2.1.2 Definition of Females Not of Childbearing Potential
Females who do not meet the above definit ion of FCBP should be classified as FNCBP.
2.2 Counseling
2.2.1 Fema lesof Childbearing Potential
For a FCBP, pomalidomide is contraindicated unless all of the following are met (ie, all FCBP 
must be counseled concerning the following risks and requi rements prior to the start of 
pomalidomide):
She understands the potential teratogeni c risk to the unborn child
She understands the need for effect ive contracepti on, without interrupti on, 28 days before 
starting pomalidomide, throughout the entire durati on of pomalidomide, during dose 
interrupti ons and for at l east 28 day s after the last dose of pom alidomide
She understands and agrees to inform the Investi gator if a change or stop of method of 
contraception is needed
She m ust be capable of complying with effect ive contraceptive measures
She is inform ed and understands the potenti al consequences of pregnancy and the need to 
notify her study  doctor immediately if there is a risk of pregnancy
She understands the need to commence pomalidomide as soon as it is dispensed following a 
negat ive pregnancy test
She understands and accepts the need to undergo pregnancy testing based on the frequency 
outlined in this plan (Section 2.4) and in the Informed Consent
She acknowl edges that she understands the hazards pomalidomide can cause to an unborn 
fetus and the nece ssary  precaut ions associated with the use of pomalido mide.

The Investigator must ensure that a FCBP:
Com plies with the condi tions of the pregnancy prevent ion plan, including confirmat ion that 
she has an adequate level of understanding
Acknowledges the afor ementioned requirements.
2.2.2 Females Not of Childbearing Potential
For a FNCBP, pomalidomide is contraindicated unless all of the following are met (ie, all 
FNCBP must be counseled concerning the following risks and requi rements prior to th e start of 
pomalidom ide):
She acknowl edges she understands the hazards pomalidomide can cause to an unborn fetus 
and the necessary  precaut ions associated with the use of pomalido mide.
2.2.3 Males
The effect of pomalido mide on sperm devel opment is not known and has not been studied. The
riskto an unborn baby infemales of child bearing potenti al whose male partner is receiving
pomalido mide is unknown at thi s time. Therefore, male subjects taking pom alidomide must m eet 
the following condi tions(ie, all males must be counsel ed concern ing the following risks and 
requi rements pri or to the start of pomalidomide study  therapy ):
Understand the potential teratogeni c risk if engaged in sexual  activi ty with a pregnant f emale 
or a FCBP
Understand the need for the use of a condom  even if he has had a vasectomy , if engaged in 
sexual activit y with a pregnant female or a FCBP l.
Understand the potential teratogenic risk if the subject donates semen or sperm.
2.3 Contraception
2.3.1 Female Subjects of childbearing Potential
Females of childbearing potenti al enrolled in this protocol  must agree to use two reliable forms 
of contraception simul taneously or to practice complete abstinence (True abstinence is 
acceptable when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifest yle of the subject. Periodic 
abstinence [eg calendar, ovulation, symptothermal or post-ovulation methods] and withdrawal 
are not acceptable methods of contracepti on.) from heterosexual contact during the following 
time periods related to this study : 1) for at least 28 days before starting pomalidomide; 2) while 
taking pomalido mide; 3) during dose interrupti ons; and 4) for at least 28 days after the last dose 
of pom alidomide.
The two methods of reliable contracepti on must include one highly effect ive method and one 
additional effective (barrier) method. If  the below contraception methods are not appropriate for 
the FCBP, she must be referred to a qualified provider of contraception methods to determine the 
medically effect ive contracepti on method appropriate to the subject. The following are example s 
of highly  effect ive and addit ional effective methods of contraception:

Tubal ligat ion
Partner’s vasectomy
Examples of a dditional effect ive methods:
Male condom
Diaphragm
Cervical Cap
Because of the increased risk of venous thrombo embo lism in subjects with multiple myelo ma 
taking pomalidomide and dexamethasone, combined oral contraceptive pills are not 
recommended. If a subject is currently using combined oral contracepti on the subject shoul d 
switch to another one of the effect ive methods listed above. The risk of venous 
thromboembo lism continues for 4to 6weeks after discont inuing combined oral contracepti on. 
The efficacy of contraceptive steroids may  be reduced during co -treatm ent wi th dexamethasone.
Implants and levonorgestrel -releasing intrauterine systems are associ ated with an increased risk 
of infect ion at the time of inserti on and irregular vaginal bleeding. Prophylact ic antibiotics 
shoul d be considered particularl y in subjects with neutropeni a.
2.3.2 Male Subjects
Male subjects must practice complete abstinence (True abstinence is acceptable when this is in 
line with the preferred and usual lifest yle of the subject. Periodic abstinence [eg calendar, 
ovulation, symptothermal or post -ovulation methods] and wit hdrawal are not acceptab le methods 
of contracepti on.) or agree to use a condo m during sexual contact with a pregnant female or a 
FCBP while taking pomalido mide, during dose interruptions and for at least 28 days after the last 
dose of pomalido mide, even if he has undergone a succ essful  vasectomy .
2.4 Pregnancy testing
Medically supervised pregnancy tests with a  m inimum sensi tivity of 25 mIU/mL must be 
perform ed for FCBP.
Females of childbearing potenti al must have two negative pregnancy tests (sensit ivity of at least 
25 mIU/mL) prior to starting pomalidomide. The first pregnancy test must be performed within 
10 to 14 days prior to the start of pomalidomide and the second pregnancy test must be 
perform ed within 24 hours prior to the start of pomalidomide. The subject may not receive 
pomalidomide until the study  doctor has verified that the resul ts of these pregnancy tests are 
negat ive.
Females of childbearing potenti al with regular or no menstrual  cycles must agree to have 
pregnancy tests weekly for the first 28 days of study participation and then every 28 days while

4 POMALIDOMIDE INFORMA TION SHEET 
FOR SUBJECTS ENROLLED IN CLINICAL RESEARCH STUDIES
Please read this Pom alidomi de Informati on Sheet before y ou start taking pom alidomide and each 
time you get a new supply . This Pomalidomi de Inform ation Sheet does nottake the place of an 
inform ed consent to participate in clinical research or tal king to your study  doctor or healthcare 
provi der about y our medical  condi tion or your treatm ent.
What is the most important information I should know about pomalidomide?
1.Pomal idomide may cause birth defects (deformed babies) or death of an unborn baby. 
Pomalidomi de is similar to the medicine thalidomide. It is known that thalido mide causes 
life-threatening birth defects. Pomalido mide has not been tested in pregnant women but may 
also cause birth defects. Pomalidomi de was found to cause birth defects when tested in 
pregnant rats and rabbits.
If you are a female who is able to become pregnant:
Do not take pomalidomide if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant
You must practic e complete abstinence from sexual contact with a male or use two 
reliable , separate forms of effective birth control at the same time: 
for 28 days before starting pomalidomide
while taking pomalidomide
during breaks ( dose interrupti ons) of pomalido mide
for at least 28 days after the last dose of pomalidomide
You must have pregnancy testing done at the following times:
within 10 to14 day s prior to the first dose of pomalidomide
24 hours prior to the first dose of pomalido mide
weekly for the first 28 day s
if you have regul ar menstrual  periods: every  28 days after the first month
if you have i rregular m enstrual  periods: every  14 days after the first month
if you miss y our peri od or have unusual menstrual bleeding
28 days after the last dose of pomalido mide (14 and 28 days after the last dose if 
menstrual periods are irregular)
Stop taking pomalidomide if you become pregnant during treatment
If you suspect you are pregnant at any time during the study , you must stop 
pomalidomide immediately and immediately inform your study doctor. The study 
doctor will report all cases of pregnancy to Celgene Corporation. 
Do not breastfeed while taking pomalidomide and for at least 28 days after the last 
dose of pomalidomide
The study  doctor will be able to advise you where to get addit ional advice on 
contraception.

If you are a female not able to become pregnant :
In order to ensure that an unborn baby is not exposed to pomalidomide, y our study  doctor 
will confirm that y ou are not abl e to becom e pregnant.
If you are a male:
The effect of pomalidomide on sperm devel opment is not known and has not been 
studi ed. The risk to an unborn baby in females whose male partner is receiving 
pomalidomide is unknown at this time.
Male subjects (including those who have had a vasectomy ) must practice complete 
abstinence or must use a condom  during sexual contact with a pregnant female or a 
female that can beco me pregnant:
While y ou are taking pomalidomide
During breaks ( dose interruptions )of pomalido mide
For at least 28 days after the last d ose of pomalidomide   
Male subjects should not donate sperm or semen while taking pomalidomide, 
during breaks (dose interrupti ons) and for at least 28 days after the last dose of 
pomalidomide. 
If you suspect that your partner is pregnant any time during t he study, you must 
immediately inform your study doctor. The study doctor will report all cases of 
pregnancy to Celgene Corporation. Your partner should call their healthcare 
provider immediately if they become pregnant.

APPENDIX 7 REVISED PROTOCOL SUM MARY OF CHANGE HISTO RY
Overall Rationale for the Revised Protocol 02, 22 -May -2018
Revised Protocol  02 incorporates changes requi red by the FDA per the partial clinical hold that 
was based on safety concerns from pembro lizuma b studies Keynote 183 and 185. Study  design 
and object ive changes to reflect endpo ints adequacy  in light of these safet y concerns were also 
incorporated. Addit ional changes include the revisi on of efficacy assessments in the protocol  to 
align wit h the current International Myelo ma Working Group (IMWG) guidance  
 
Revisio ns pertain to both present and future subj ects.
The revisi ons of Revised Protocol  02 shoul d be implemented once IRB/IEC/HA approval  is 
received.
Summary of key changes of Revised Protocol 02
Section Number & Title Description of Change Brief Rationale
Title page Change in BMS study personnel. Administrative change
Title page, SynopsisElotuzumab has been removed from the 
title of the study. Title updated to reflect the removal of 
the exploratory NE -Pd arm. 
Synopsis, Investigational 
Product(s), Dose and Mode 
of Administration, 
Duration of Trea tment with 
Investigational Product(s)Explo ratory  Arm (NE -Pd: Arm C) is 
closed to enrollment.To focus enrollment on the 
investigational and control arms, the 
exploratory NE -Pd arm was removed.
Synopsis Objectives
Section 1.5 Objective(s)Changed objectiv e response rate (ORR) 
from primary to secondary objective.
Promoted overall survival (OS) from 
exploratory objective to secondary 
objective. Based on pembrolizumab data, BMS 
deemed ORR as a co -primary  
endpoint for an accelerated approval 
strategy  is no lo nger adequate. 
Progression free survival (PFS) is a 
clinically relevant surrogate endpoint 
for efficacy.
As the gold standard for efficacy, OS 
was upgraded to secondary objectives.
Synopsis, Study  Design, 
Study Schema
Section 3.1 Study Design 
and Duration
Figure 3.1 -1 Study Design 
SchematicExplo ratory  NE-Pd arm is removed 
from study design.
Cross -over was removed.
Sample size and randomization ratio 
were updated to reflect that only N -Pd 
and Pd arm are continuing enrollment.
Study schema was updated.To focus enrollment on the 
investigational and control arms, the 
exploratory NE -Pd arm was 
removed. 
Cross -over was stopped as of 1 Sept 
2017 per the FDA request.

Summary of key changes of Revised Protocol 02
Section Number & Title Description of Change Brief Rationale
Synopsis, Statistical 
Considerations 
Section 8 Statistical 
ConsiderationsUpdated Sample Size Determination to 
reflect the change in study design (ie, 
removal of NE -Pd arm). 
Updated Populations for Analyses, 
Endpoints, Efficacy Analyses, and 
Interim Analyses for efficacy to reflect 
the changes in study objectives (ie, 
primary  objective changed from co -
primary  (ORR and PFS) to PFS only).
Added an I nterim analysis for futility 
(ie, 50% of total events within N -Pd and 
Pd arms)Statistical considerations section was 
updated to reflect the changes in study 
design and study objectives.
Section 1.7 Overall 
Risk/Benefit AssessmentAdd information on the safety risk 
concerns from the pe mbrolizumab studies 
and how they affected this study.Language was added to inform study 
investigators of the safety risks 
concerns from the pembrolizumab 
studies communicated by the FDA, 
the partial clinical hold placed on the 
study by the FDA in light o f these 
concerns, and the stopped cross -over 
from the control Pd arm to the 
exploratory NE -Pd arm that FDA 
required amongst the hold conditions.
Section 3.3.2 Exclusion 
Criteria
Criterio n 2 Medical 
Histor y and Co ncurrent 
Diseases c)Updated to active syst emic infection Systemic added for clarification
Section 3.3.2 Exclusion 
Criteria 3. Prior Therapy or 
SurgeryNew exclusion criteria of plasmapheresis 
within 4 weeks of randomization.Plasmapheresis may interfere with 
eligibility assessments for measurable
disease and with quantification of 
baseline value for M protein/ sFLC 
necessary for accurate response 
assessment. This exclusion criterion 
was inadvertently omitted in earlier 
protocol version.
New criterion added: subjects who have 
received a live / attenuated vaccine within 
30 days of first treatment are excluded.Updated exclusion for nivolumab 
protocols.
Section 3.4.1 Prohibited 
and/o r Restricted 
TreatmentsAny live / attenuated vaccine (eg 
varicella, zoster, yellow fever, rotavirus, 
oral polio and measles, mumps, rubella 
(MMR)) is prohibited during treatment 
and until 100 days post last dose.Update for nivolumab protocols.
Section 4.5.1.1.1 
PomalidomideRem oved requirement for pomalidomide
administration at least 2 hours prior to 
nivolumab dosing.To align with pomalidomide package 
insert.

 1. Introduction  
The purpose of this statistical analysis plan (SAP)  is to provide detail s of the statistical 
analyses and reporting that are outlined in the study protocol, which is dated on Oct 12, 2017 
and titled “ Multicenter, Open -Label, Interventional Stu dy on the Safety and Tolerability of 
Oxymetazoline and Energy -Based Therapy in Subjects with Rosacea ”.  This SAP  should be 
reviewed in conjunction with the study protocol. Information contained in the protocol will not be restated  unless it is essential  for the descriptions in  this SAP . In case of any 
discrepancies (for example, the definition of the Safety Analysis Population) between the protocol and the SAP, the SAP will supersede the protocol, as the SAP is intended to be more 
specific and precise with respect to statistical analysis and reporting .  Any amendment s to the 
SAP will be made prior to datab ase lock. Any additional analyses not described in the final 
SAP or deviations from the final SAP will be documented in the clinical study report.  
This study is a Phase 4 study sponsored by Alle
 rgan Plc. This study  is a multicenter, 
interventional, open- label safety and tolerability study to evaluate the safety and tolerability 
of oxymetazoline HCl cream 1.0% when used as an adjunctive treatment to energy-based 
therapy for subjects with moderate to severe persistent facial erythema associated with rosacea.  
 Approximately 45 subjects will be enrolled into this  stud
 y at 4 clinical sites in the United 
States . The duration of the study for each subject is 10 weeks. This includes a screening 
period of up to 2 weeks, a treatment period of 8 weeks, comprising of daily dosing of study drug and 2 energy-based therapy sessions, followed by a final exit visit at Week 8 (Day 56). 
 
There will be  no inter
 im analysis. O ne final analysis is planned for this study. The final 
analysis will be performed at the completion of the study. Database lock will be executed for the final analysis.  
 
 
1.1 Primary Study Objectives and Design  
1.1.1 Study Design  
This is a multicenter, interventional,  single -arm, open -label safety and tolerability study . 
 
Sample size calcul ation a nd power consideration are discussed in Section 8.2 of the study 
protocol. A total of 45 subjects with rosacea- associated moderate to severe persistent facial 
erythema will be enrolled into this study. Subjects  will be screened for eligibility, and will be 
consented for the study entry. 
 
4 
  
On Day 1, a ll subje cts will receive one  of the fo llowing energy -based therapies: Potassium 
Titanyl Phosphate (KTP), Pulsed Dye Laser (PDL) or I ntense Pulsed  Light (IPL) . After a  2-
day washout, oxymetazoline HCl cream  1.0% will be applied once- daily starting from Day 3 
up through Day 27. On Day 29, all subjects will receive a second energy -based therapy , 
followed by a 2-day washout and then once daily application of ox ymetazoline HC1 cream 
1.0% up through Day 56.  
1.1.2 Primary Objectives  
The primary objective is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of oxymetazoline HCl cream 
1.0% when used as an adjunctive treatment to energy- based therapy for subjects with 
moderate to severe persistent facial erythema associated with rosacea.     
 
1.1.3 Secondary and Other Objectives  
The secondary objective is to evaluate preliminary measures of efficacy of oxymetazoline 
HCl cream 1.0% when used as an adjunctive treatment to energy -based therapy for subjects 
with moderate to severe persistent facial erythema associated with rosacea.  
  
2. Analysis Populations and Data Conventions  
2.1 Analys is Populations  
To adequately describe the appropriate statistical analyses,  four analys is populations are 
defined as follows: • Enrolled Population: consists of all subjects who signed an informed consent form (ICF
), thus deemed as enrolled for the study. 
• Safety  Ana lysis Population: consists of all enrolled subjects who met the eligibility 
criter ia and  had an energy- based therapy and  received at least one dose of study drug as 
treatment in this study.   
• Evaluable Population: consists of all safety subjects who had at least one baseline effic
acy assessments  at Day 1 or prior to Day 1 and had at le ast one post- treatment efficacy 
assessment s between Day 3 and Day 56, inclusive. 
•       Per Protocol Population: consists of all evaluable subjects who have not had any 
sig
nificant violations of the protocol , including but not limiting to significant deviations 
from the scheduled visit windows.  
 
5 
  
Unless specified otherwise, the enrolled population will be used for subject disposition, 
demog
raphics, and baseline characteristics summaries; the safety analysis population will be 
used for safety analyses , and the evaluable population will be used for the efficacy analyses. 
Efficacy analyses may be repeated on the per protocol population if significant protocol 
violations are found prevalent in the evaluable population.  
 Note that in  the cont
 ext of this analysis plan (including the T able/ Listing/F igure  mockup 
shells), the terms safety analysis p opulation and safety population are interchangeably used, 
and subjects in the safety population can be calle d safety subjects  and subjects in the 
evaluable population can b e called evaluable subjects.   
 
 
2.2 Visit and Timepoint Windows  
There is no plan to program matically  derive visit/timepoint windows. The  scheduled 
visits /timepoints as recorded on the electronic Case Report Form (CRF) will be  directly  taken 
as the analysis vi sits/timepoints and will be used in reporting and analyses.  The analysis 
visits include  the Screening Visit, the Baseline (Day 1) Visit, the Day 3 Visit, the Day 29 
Visit, the Day 31 Visit and the Day 5 6 (Exit Visit). The analysis timepoints corresponding to 
each visit on and after Day 1 include the Pre -Dose and the Post- Dose.  Also r efer to Table 1  
Schedule of Assessments and Procedures (page 18 ) of the P rotocol (Oct 12, 2017) for 
scheduled visits/timepoints.     
 If there are multiple observations of sa me ass
 essment within the same  scheduled 
visit/timepoint window, all values of multiple observations will be included for listing, but 
only the mean value of multiple observations will be used for the by -visit/timepoint summary 
or analysis .  Assessment outside the scheduled visit /timepoint window will be marked as 
unscheduled as sessment, and will be used for listing only.  
  
2.3 Data Conventions 
 
2.3.1   Study day 
For each subject, t he refe rence start date (also referred to as Day 1)  is the da te when the 
subject had  an energy -based therapy.  Study day  will be calculated  using visit date and the 
 
6 
 reference start date as follows: (1) study day = visit date – reference start date + 1, for any 
visit date ≥ refer ence start date.  (2) study day = visit date – reference start date, for any visit 
date < reference start date.  
 
2.3.2   Imputation for missin g measurement or assessment data  
On some certain  p arameters , a subject has  multiple assessments  prior to the initiation of  the 
energy -based therapy at Day 1. Specifically, th ose parameters include vital sign 
measurements,  urine pregnancy tests,  Clinician’s Telangiectasia A ssessments (CTA) , 
Satisfaction assessment s for Rosacea facial redness,  FACE -Q satisfaction with skin scale.  
The baseline values for subjects on  those  parameters will be derived using the rule of Last 
Observation Carried Forward ( LOCF ) as follows: The value immediately prior to the 
initiation of  energy -based therapy at Day 1 will be used as the baseline value; if that value is 
missing  or does not exist, then  the value at screening will be used.  On other parameters, a 
subject  has one single assessment or measurement during screening or prior to the initiation 
of the energy -based therapy  at Day 1, then the single value will simply  be used as the 
baselin e value for the subject.     
 
There is no imputation of missing values for any p ost-baseline measurement s or assessment s. 
All data summaries and analyses of post -baseline data will be conducted using observed 
cases.  
 
2.3.3   Study end date  for pa tient  
Study end date for each  individua l patient  is de fined as the date of comp letion of last 
assessment on  the Day 56  visit or the date of the early withdrawal visit in case of earlier  
discontinuation from treatment.  Note that subject s who are discontinued earlier from 
treatment for whatever  reasons will be invited to attend the early  withdrawal visit for the end-
of-study data collection.   
 
2.3.4   Study completer  
Study completers are defined as  those evaluable subjects who have completed the last 
assessment on the Day 56 visit.   
 2.3.5   Other conventions  
Summary statistics  (us
 ed inter changeably with the term descriptive statistics)  for continuous 
data include sample size (N), mean, standard deviation (SD), median, minimum, and 
maximum. Categorical variables will be summar ized using sample size (N), frequency and 
percentages of patients. In calculating the percentage, unless specified other wise, the count of 
 
7 
 subjects “at risk” will be used  as denominator.   Ordinal variables will be handled as 
categorical variables when  presenting summary statistics using ordinal variables.    
 
Change from baseline is calculated as fol low- up minus baseline. Percentage change from 
baseline is calculated as change from baseline divided by baseline value, then multiplied by 100. If baseline value is zero, percentage change from baseline will be undefined. If baseline 
value is missing, percentage change from baseline will be missing.  
 
Data will be pooled across clinical sites/centers  for
  analyses  with an except ion of one patient 
enrollment table.   
 The International Syste
 m of Units (Système international d'unités or SI ) is the current 
international standard metric system.  The SI units will be  use d for the reporting in all  
Tables/Figures/Listings  for this study.   
 All statistical analysis and repo rting 
 will be performed using SAS® version 9.3 or higher. 
     
3. Disposition and Exit Status  
3.1 Scre ening Log Data  
Subject  eligibility c riteria  (including both inclusion and exclusion criteria) and date of 
informed consent will be listed for  the enrolled  popula tion. Note that date of informed 
consent will be included in the subject disposition listing.   
3.2 Disposition and Exit Status  
Reasons for exclusion from safety population will summarized  and will be listed for the 
enrolled population. Subject  disposition wil l be listed  for the enrolled population.  
  
4. Demographics and Baseline Characteristics 
4.1 Demogr aphics  
All patient demographic and baseline characteristic data will be summ arized using 
descriptive statistics for the enrolled  population and the safety population. 
 
8 
  
Age (years) captured at enroll ment will be summarized as a continuous variable. Other 
continuous variables to be presented include weight, height and body mass index (BMI)  and 
baseline vital signs  (i.e., blood pressure, pulse rate, and oral body temper ature) .  Categorical 
or ordinal variables to be presented include sex, race, ethnicity, the t ype o f energy -based 
therapy on Day 1 and Fitzpatrick skin phototype. 
 Demographic tables will also be presented for the safety  popul
 ation stratified by the p resence 
or absence of Treatment -Emergent Adverse Events (TEAE)  during the study, and by whether  
having had at least 1 -grade worsening from baseline in Clinician’s Telangiectasia 
Assessments (CTA)  at any timepoint in the study.  
 All demographic  data
  will be liste d.  
 
4.2 Prior Medications 
Prior medications are defined as any medication which is  administered any time prior to the 
initiation of the energy -based therapy  treatment at Day 1  regardless when the medication 
stops.  Prior medications will be coded by the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) class
ification system according to the World Health Organization (WHO) Drug WHODDE 
March  2016 or later . Medications will be summarized by ATC class (level 2) and subclass 
preferred term (PT) for all patients in the safety analysis cohort.   The summary tables will show the frequency count and percentage of patients with at least 
1 usage of
 medications on the subclass level within each ATC  class, sorted alphabetically. 
Percentages will be calculated using the number of patients in the safety population as the 
denominator.  
All prior  medications will be listed.  
 
 
4.3 Concomitant Medications  
Concomi tant medications encompass  any medication that  is administered any time after the 
initiation of the energy -based therapy, regardless of when the medication starts or  stops. Note 
that concomitant medication includes on-going prior medications. i.e., medicinal products 
 
9 
 that are administered  prior to the initiation of the energy -based therapy at Day 1 and is still 
being used during the study.   
 
Any concomitant medication will be recorded at each visit, including the medication name, dose, unit
, frequency, route of administration, indication, and medication start and end dates. 
 Concomitant medications will be coded by the ATC classification system according to the WHO Dru
g WHODDE Mar ch 2016 or later . Medications will be summarized by ATC class 
(level 2) and subclass (PT) for all patients in the safety analysis cohort.  
 The summary tables will show the frequency count and percentage of patients with at least 1 usage of
 medication on the subclass level within each A TC class , sorted alphabetically. 
Percentages will be calculated using the number of patients in the safety population as the 
denominator. 
 All concomitant medications will be listed.  
 
Prohibited Medications are listed in Section 5.6.10.1 of the Protocol.  Prohibited concomitant 
medicat
ions that were inadvertently administered will be summarized similarly as that for 
concomitant medications.  Listing will also be provided for prohibited medications that were  
inadvertently administered.   
 Per Section 5.6.10.2 of the Protocol, t reatme
 nts by laser, light-source, or other energy based 
therapies to the face, other  than those treatments performed as part of the study, are not 
permitted during the study . Dermatological treatments on the face (e.g., facial peels, 
microdermabrasion, exfoliating treatments) are prohibited for the duration of the study.  The 
use of any of such treatments is considered as a deviation (violation) of protocol per this S AP.  
Listing of protocol deviation (violation) will be provided. 
 
 
4.4 Medical History  
Descriptions of medical history findings will be coded using Medical Dictionary for 
Regulato ry Activities (MedDRA) version 20.1 or later. Medical history  will be summarized 
for the safety population by the number and percentage of patients within each system organ 
class (SOC) and PT, sorted descending overall frequency.  
 
10 
 Medical history will be listed for all patients in the safety population. Medical history data 
listings will be sorted by patient number, start date, SOC, PT  and verbatim term . 
 
 
5. Efficacy Analyses  
For this study, efficacy a nalyse s will be  exploratory in nature.  Certain efficacy analyses will 
be conducted to evaluate the effect  of daily application of oxymetazoline 1.0% cream 
adjunctive to energy -based therapy  on Clinician Erythema Assessment ( CEA ), rosacea facial 
redness and subject’s satisfaction rating.  These analyses as described below will be based  on 
the eva
luable population.  
  
5.1 Collection of Efficacy Me asurements  and Derivation of 
Efficacy Variable s 
The following measurements and variables are of the primary interest.  
 
• Measurement: CEA ;  
Vari
able:  Improvement on CEA from baseline.  An improvement is defined by a 
negat
ive change from baseline.   
 
• Measurement : Satis faction rating  per the Satisfaction Assessment for Rosacea Facial 
Rednes
s; 
Variable: Proportion of subjects who rate “Satisfied” or “Very Satisfied”.     
• Measurement : Satis
 faction rating  per the FACE -Q Satisfaction with Skin Scale ; 
Var
iable: P roporti on of subjects who rate “Somewhat Satisfied” or “Very Satisfied”.   
  
• Measurement: Rosacea facial redness using DIA of standardized facial photographs;  
Vari
able: Percentage change from baseline in rosacea facial redness.  
 
5.2 Analyses of Eff icacy Variable (s) 
There is no statistical testing of hypotheses  pertaining to  efficacy  variables. S tatistical 
inference will be limited to the constructio n of distribution- free 95% CI for the median  
percentage change from baseline variables, since these percentage change variables are 
known for the deviation from normality in distribution.  The d istribution -free  95% CI  for the 
 
11 
 median will be calculated  using SAS® procedure Proc Univariate.  In this section, s ummary  
tables mainly in the forms of descriptive statistics will be presented  for the  above- specified  
efficacy  and patient repo rted outcomes (PRO) variables .  
 
• The number and percentage of subjects with at least a 1 -gra de improvement on the 
CEA  from baseline, by visit/timepoint.  
• Summary statistics of CEA by visit/time point. 
•
 Proportion of subjects indicating Satisfied or Very Satisfied with treatment on the 
Items
 of Satisfaction Assess ment for Rosacea Facial Redness, by visit.   There are two 
items (questions) . See Appendix 14.2 of the Protocol.  Item 1 (Question 1) is: Right 
now, how satisfied are you with the appearance of your facial redness?  Item 2 
(Question 2) is: Right now, how satisfied are you with the appearance of the amount of redness on your face?   This summary will be  repeated for each of the two items.  
• Prop ortion of subjects indicating Somewhat Satisfied or Very Sati sf
 ied with treatment 
on the FACE -Q Satisfaction with Skin Scale, by visit. There are 12 questions on the 
FACE -Q Satisfaction assessments regarding the subjects’ rating of their satisfaction 
with skin. See Appendix 14.3 of the Protocol. This summary will be repeate d for the 
response to each of the 12 questions, and for the average response to the 12 questions.  
• Percentage change from baseline in  rosac ea facial redness using  Digital Image 
Analysis ( DIA) of standardized facial photographs, by visit/timepoint. This summary 
table will be presented if the rosacea facial redness data are obtained and such facial redness can be quantified.  This summary table for the percentage change from baseline in rosa cea facial redness will be provided.  
 
5.3 Other Analyses of Efficacy Variable(s)  
Not applicable.  
 
5.4 Subgroup Analyses for Efficacy Variables  
Not applicable.

 6. Safety Analyses  
All safety analyses  will be based on the safety population. Safety will be assessed primarily 
in terms of the frequency count and the binominal in cidence proportion of the adverse events  
of interest . The binomial incidence proportion for a given event  of inte rest during a certain 
period is defined as the number of unique patients who have experienced the event of interest 
in the period divided by the number of patients in the safety population, then multiplied by 
100.  Note that, for the calculation of the incidence proportion, the numerator is counted at 
subject level. Specifically, if a s ubject has experienced the event (s) of interest (at a given 
summarization level) more than once during the period, he/she is counted only once into the numerator. The binomial incidence proportion of an event is also called the percentage of 
subjects who have had such an event. The two terms are used interchangeably.  The 95% CIs 
for binomial incidence proportion will also be calculated using the Cl opper and Pearson 
exact method (via SAS
® procedure Proc Freq).     
 
 
6.1 Exposure to Study Treatment(s)  
Treatment duration in days will be calculated as:  Date of last dose  of study medication  - 
Date of the initiation of the energy -based therapy + 1.  Treatment duration will be 
summarized using descriptive statistics.  Number of energy -based therapies  administered and 
number of days in which Oxymetazoline 1.0% cream had been applied over the study period 
will be summarized using descriptive statistics.   
 
Partial or missing start/end dates will be handled as per Section  2.3.3. 
 All tr
eatment data will be listed.  
  
6.2 Adver se Events  
Adverse event s will be coded using MedDRA version 20.1 or later to give a PT and a SOC 
term for each event.  
 An adverse event ( AE) is de
 fined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical 
investigation al patient administered a pharmaceutical ( investigational) product and which 
does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment.      
 
13 
 All AE s will be included in by-subject AE listings. A separate listing will be created with all 
the distinct levels of SOC  and PT, and the verbatim investigator description reported in the 
study. Sorting will be by earliest observed SOC, PT within SOC and then verbatim 
description.  A treatment- emerg
 ent adverse event ( TEAE ) is a post- baseline AE where (i) there is no pre-
treatment AE of the s ame MedDRA primary SOC and PT ; or (ii) the maximum severity 
during the post- baseline period is greater than the maximal severity of any pre- treatment AE 
of the same MedDRA primary SOC and PT during the screening/baseline period .  Note that 
the post- baselin e period of the study starts upon the initiation of the energy- based therapy at 
Day 1.   Any AEs reported after signing of the Informed Consent Form and prior to the energy- based 
t
herapy on Day 1 are considered pretreatment AEs (PTAEs)  
 Relationship to stu dy dru
 g is categorized as ‘related’, ‘possibly related’, ‘unlikely related’, 
‘not related’ , and ‘not assessable’. Relationship to trial medication as per investigator is not 
expected to be missing after data cleaning . However, if relationship is confirmed as missing, 
the AE will be considered as treatment related as per PI.  
 An overall summary of frequency count and the binomial incidence proportion with  
associ
ated 95% CI s will be presented  to describe the incidents of TEAE s. Note that 95% CIs 
of the binom ial incidence proportion will be presented  for the overall summary analyses of 
TEAEs , but not fo r the by -visit/timepoint analyses .  Percentages and corresponding 95% CI s 
will be displayed to 1  decimal place.  
 Each type of AE will
  be tabul ated by SOC and P T within SOC.  The SOC and PT within 
SOC will be  sorted by descending frequency . If a subject  has multiple occurrences (start and 
stop) of an event associated with a specific SOC and PT, a patient will only be counted once 
in the incidence count for the SO C level and once at each PT within the SOC level.  
 
The incidence of all TEAEs  by SOC and PT will be presented for the following categories: 
• Any TEAE  
• An
y TEAE  related to energy- based therapy and leading to discontinuation of study 
medication  
• Any TEAE  r elated to treatment (i.e., study medication  or energy-based therapy or 
both)  
 
14 
 • Any TEAE by maximum severity  
• Any PTAE  
 
 The f
ollowing listings will be provided: 
• Listing of all TEAE  
• Listing of patients with TEAEs related to energy -based therapy and leading to  
            discontinuation of study medication  
• Listing of patients with TEAEs le ading to discontinuation of treatment 
 
6.3 Serious Adverse Events  
A serious adverse event (SAE) is any AE occurring at any dose that results in any of the 
following outcomes: death, a life- threatening AE, inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of 
existing hospitalization, a persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or a congenital 
anomaly/birth defect. Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -
threatening, or require hospitalization may be considered a SAE  when, based upon 
appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Allergan 
considers all cancer AEs as SAEs . In addition, an abortion (spontaneous or non-spontaneous) 
is also considered a SAE . Any pre -planned surgery or procedure should be clearly 
documented in the source documents at the center by the medically qualified investigator at the time of the patient’s entry into the study. If it has not been documented at the time of the 
patient’s entry into the study, then it should be documented as a SAE  and reported to Allergan.  
 If an unexpected AE is serious and suspecte d, it is a
  suspected “unexpected ” serious adverse 
reactions (SUSAR). See Sectio n of 7.1.2.1.2 of the Protocol for details , such as what is 
considered as “unexpected”.     An overall summary of frequency count and the binomial incidence proportion with  the 
as
sociated 95% CIs will be presented  to describe the incidents of treatment emergent 
SAE s. Note that 95% CIs of the binomial incidence proportion will be presented for the 
overall summary analyses of SAE, but not for the by -visit/timepoint analyses.  Percentages 
and corresponding 95% CIs will be displayed to 1  decimal place.   
 The incidence of all treatment -emergen
 t SAEs by SOC  and PT within SOC will be presented 
for the following categories: 
 
15 
 • Any SAE  
• Any SAE  rel ated to energy -based therapy and leading to discontinuation of study 
medication  
• Any SAE  rel ated to treatment (i.e., study medication or energy-based therapy or both) 
• Any SAE by maximum severity  
• Any SUSAR  
 
  The f
ollowing listings will be provided: 
• Listing of subjects who died 
• Listing of  su bject s with treatment -emergent SAEs  
• Listing of subjects with treatment -emerg ent SAEs  related to energy -based therapy  
            and leading to discontinuation of study medication          
• Listing of patients with treatment -emer gent SAEs  leading to discontinuation of 
treatment  
• Listing of patien ts wi th any SUSAR

 6.4 Dermal Tolerability Assessments  
Subject -assessed  pruritus (i tching), stinging/burning and dermatologist- assessed  
dryness and scaling will be summarized  and displ ayed in terms of frequenc y count and 
proportion of subjects who report ed at least a 1 -grade worsening in severity from baseline at 
any time points over the study period.  
 For all dermal tolerability assessments, the scale  (grad
 e) was:  0 = none, 1 = mild, 2 = 
moderate, 3 = severe. A subject is classified  as having had a at least 1- grade worsening from 
baseline for a timepoint if his change from baseline value ≥  1 for the timepoint.  The 
denominator used for calculating the proportion is the number of safety subjects who have baseline and at least one data of  post- baseline d ermal tolerability assessments.  
 There is no testing of any hypothesis or interval estimation of proportions with respect to  
derma
l tolerability assessment s.   
 
Frequency count and proportion of subjects having had at least  1-grade worsening from 
baseline in  dermal tolerability assessment parameters  will be repeated  and displayed by 
visit/timepoint. Summary statistics  of dermal tolerability assessment parameters will also be 
presented by visit/timepoint.  
 
6.5 Clinic ian’s Telangiectasia  Assessments (CTA)  
Clinician’s Telangiectasia Assessments (CTA)  will be summarized and displayed in terms of 
frequency count and proportion of subjects who report at least a 1-grade worsening in 
severity from baseline at any time point over the study period.   For CTA , the scale was:  0 = clear skin , 1= al
 most clear, 2 = mild, 3 = moderate, 4 = severe.  
A subject is classified as having had a at least 1-grade worsening from baseline for a 
timepoint if his change from baseline value ≥  1 for the timepoint.  The denominator used for 
calculating the proportion is the number of safety subjects who have baseline and at least one 
data of  post- baseline CTA .  
 There is no testing of any hypothesis or interval estimation of the proportions wit h resp
 ect to 
CTA .   
 Frequency count and proportion of subjects having had at least
  a 1-grade worsening from 
baseline in CTA will also be presented  by visit/timepoint. Summary statistics of CTA will 
also be presented by visit/timepoint.

6.6 Vital Signs  
Vital signs (e.g., systolic/diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, respiration rate, and body temperature) will be summarized by visit/timepoint using descriptive statistics.    
6.7 Other Safety Analyses  
All positive results of pregnancy tests will be listed.  
6.8 Subgroup Analyses for Safety Variables  
Not applicable.  
 
7. Pharmacokinetic, Biomarker, Genomic, or Immunogenicity Data 
Analyses 
Not applicable.  
 
8. Health Outcomes Data Analyses 
Analyses of c ertain patient report ed outcome (PRO) measurements are described in Secti on 
5.2.  No other health outcomes data analyses will be conducted.  
 
9. Interim Analyses  
There is no interim analysis planned for this study.  
10. Data Collected but not Analyzed 
Not Applicable.  
 
11. Deviations from Protocol  
The modified Intent- to-Treat Population a s defin ed in the Protocol (Oct 12, 2017) will not be 
used for reporting and analyses, since the i ntent-to-t reat principle is  commonly confined to 
randomized trials.  Instead, an evaluable p opulation, which is applicable for non-randomized 
trials, is defined in the SAP (See Section 2.1) and will be used for efficacy summaries.  
 
18 
 Another deviation from the Protocol is that per protocol analysis population is defined and 
added into the SAP, and efficacy analyses will be repeated on the per protocol population i f 
more than 20% of the evaluable subjects have had major protocol violations.

13. Amendment(s)  
Per protocol analysis population is defined and added to the SAP of Version 1.1.  The per 
protocol population consists of all evaluable subjects who have not had any significant 
violations of the study protocol.  Patients who have had significant violations of the study protocol will be identified before the analyses on the per protocol population being 
performe d. Efficacy analyses will  be repeated on the per protocol population if more than 
20% of the evaluable subjects have had major protocol violations.  
 As those specified in the study protocol, major protocol violations (deviations) may include, 
but ar
e not limited to: 
 
19 
 (1) Inclusion/Exclusion criteria violations.  
(2) Inadequate compliance with study drug. 
(3) P
rohibited medications and treatments taken.  Ref er to the Protocol sub-sections 5.6.10.1 
and 5.6.10.2 for the list of prohibited medications and treatments.  
 (4) Significant deviations from the study drug administration schedule.  Speci fically, if a 
subject had ever deviated by more than 7 days from the  scheduled visit windows, the subject 
will be considered as having had a major protocol violation. 
 The final list of the major protocol deviations will be defined during the da ta rev
 iew meeting 
and before the final study database lock day.

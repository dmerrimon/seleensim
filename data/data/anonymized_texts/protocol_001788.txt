a Rollover subjects from Part A or Part B to Part C n eed to complete 1 year of treatment in Part C before entering 
the Extension Phase.  
b Subjects in Part C are eligible to re ceive combination treatment for a maximum of 2 years of treatment in total 
(the initial phase plus the Extension Phase of Part C). Subjects may continue ALKS 4230 as a monotherapy 
beyond the maximum of 2 years of treatment — both in Part B by continuing treatment or in Part C by 
switching to monotherapy.  
Note ( Figure 1 A ): If a dose higher than 6 μg/kg of ALKS 4230 is found to be tolera ble for Part A, that dose may 
be used in Part B or Part C.  
 
Part A  
In the dose-escalation part of the study, subjects with advanced solid tumors will receive ALKS 4230 
by IV administration daily for 5 days, followed by a period off treatment in repeating cycles. During 
Cycle 1, the period off treatment will be 9 days, resulting in a cycle length of 14 days (2 weeks). Cycle 
2 and subsequent cycles will have a period off treatment of 16 days, resulting in a cycle length of 21 days (3 weeks) for each cycle. For the first 2 treatment cycles, subjects will receive ALKS 4230 as 
inpatients at a medical facility with access to medical support measures and to the intensive care unit, i f 
needed. In the absence of DLTs, subjects who remain in the study may receive subs equent doses of 
ALKS 4230 on an outpatient basis. 
In dose escalation, cohorts in the study will use a standard 3+3 study design with 3 to 6 subjects per 
cohort to receive AL KS 4230 at dose levels described in  Figure 1. The starting dose of 0.1 µg/kg/day 
was selected based on the minimal anticipated biologic effect level. Doses in subsequent cohorts will be increased until the optimal b iologic dose is ide ntified or the maximum tolerated dose is reached. 
Additional dose levels will be considered if the RP2D or maximum tolerated dose (MTD) has not been 
reached within the proposed dose range. 
During dose escalation, each cohort will be evaluated for safety and tolerability using a 3+3 study 
design with allowance for over-enrollment with 4 to 7 subjects and a minimum of 3 evaluable subjects 
per cohort to receive IV ALKS 4230 at the specified dose and schedule. If none of the 3 subjects 
experi ences a DLT, then t he next dose level will open for enrollment. If 1 of the 3 subjects experiences 
a DLT, then 3 additional subjects will be enrolled at the same dose level. If no additional DLTs are observed, then the next dose level will open for enrollm ent. 
If 2 or more s ubjects experience DLTs at a dose level, no further dose escalations will occur. One or 
more lower dose level(s) may be tested in search of the MTD, defined as the dose level immediately below that in which ≥2 of 6 subjects experience DL Ts. Prior to any do se escalation, a teleconference of 
the Safety Review Committee (SRC), to include at a minimum the study investigators who have enrolled subjects and the Sponsor’s Medical Monitor, will be convened to review the safety data from 
the current cohort and to de cide if  dose escalation is warranted . An interim review of the safety data to 
guide the selection of the RP2D is planned prior to the start of Part B of the study using data from 
subjects enrolled in Part A.  
 
Part B  
After the RP2D is determined, the second part of the study (ie, Part B) will begin. In this part of the 
study, up to 41 subjects with melanoma and up to 41 subjects with RCC may be enrolled to receive 
ALKS  4230 at the RP2D. Enrollment to these cohorts will follow a partial response (unconf irmed)  
Simon’s two -stage design enrollment as outlined below. Response assessments will be based on the 
RECIST guidelines.

a No more than 5 ocular melanoma subjects may be enrolled into this cohort. 
 
Part C  
In the third part of the study (Part C), subjects will receive ALKS 4230 in combination with 
pembrolizumab. Part C will run independently of and concurrently with monotherapy Part A and 
Part B.  
A 3- to 6- subject run- in phase will be utilized to assess the saf ety of ALKS 4230 in combination with 
pembrolizumab. During the safety run-in phase, subjects may be enrolled with any tumor type as 
described in the nonrollover cohorts. Rollover subjects (Cohort 4) are not eligible to participate in the 
safety run-in phas e of Part C.  
During the safety run-in phase, the first 3 subjects will receive ALKS 4230 at the dose level of 
1 µg/kg/day. The first subject enrolled at the 1 µg/kg/day dose level will be monitored as a sentinel 
subject. This sentinel subject will be obser ved for safet y for a period of 7 days (the sentinel period) 
from first dose of ALKS 4230. If the sentinel subject tolerates treatment adequately during this period, 
then up to 2 additional subjects may be enrolled into the 1 µg/kg/day dose level. If all 3 subjects 
tolerate therapy adequately through their first 21-day cycle as assessed by the SRC, then the study will 
progress to the 3 µg/kg/day dose level. At the discretion of the SRC, an additional 3 subjects may be enrolled at the 1 μg/kg/day dose level t o further ass ess safety prior to opening enrollment at the 
3 μg/kg/day dose level.  
Once the safety run -in phase at the 1 µg/kg/day dose level is complete and the SRC has agreed to 
proceed to the 3 µg/kg/day dose level, the first subject will be enrolled at the 3 µg/kg/day dose level 
and will be observed for 7 days as a sentinel subject. If this subject tolerates treatment adequately for 
7 days, then up to 2 additional subjects may be enrolled in the following week. If the second and third subjects tolerat e the 3 µg/kg/day dose level adequately for 7 days, then 3 additional subjects can be 
enrolled beginning the following week.  
If the first 6 subjects tolerate therapy adequately for their first 21- day cycle as assessed by the SRC, 
then enrollment into expa nsion Cohorts C1, C2, C3, and C4 will be open without restriction in the rate 
of enrollment
 at the dose determined by the SRC. 
Up to 20 subjects will be enrolled into each of Cohorts C1, C2, and C3 based on their tumor type and 
prior treatment with programm ed death receptor -1/programmed death ligand- 1 (PD -L1) pathway 
inhibitors as described in the inclusion criteria. Subjects with RCC or melanoma will not be eligible for enrollment in Cohorts C1, C2, or C3. Subjects on ALKS 4230 monotherapy in Part A or Part B who 
have e xperienced disease progression after a minimum of 2 cycles or stable disease (SD) after a 
minimum of 4 cycles and who are expected to tolerate treatment with combination therapy are eligible for treatment in Part C, Cohort C4. Subjects who have partial response (PR) or complete response (CR) on monotherapy are ineligible to rollover unless subsequently demonstrating progressive disease. 
Subjects will receive  200 mg of pembrolizumab every 3 weeks in combination with ALKS 4230 by IV 
administrati on daily for 5 days, followed by a period off treatment of 16 days, resulting in a cycle 
length of 21 days (3 weeks) for each cycle.

Should monotherapy doses above 6 µg/kg/day ALKS 4230 be shown to be tolerated, then the dose of 
ALKS 4230 in the combination arms may be increased. In Cohorts C5, C6, and C7, up to 53 subjects with melanoma, up to 42 subjects with non–small -cell lung cancer  (NSCLC), and up to 36 subjec ts 
with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck may be enrolled to receive ALKS 4230 in combination with pembrolizumab at the ALKS 4230 RP2D. Enrollment to these cohorts will follow a 
PR (unconfirmed) Simon’s two -stage enrollment as outlined below. Re sponse assess ments will be 
based on the RECIST and iRECIST guidelines.

Extension Phase (Part B and Part C only)  
An Extension Phase is planned for subjects receiving clinical benefit from the treatment who are 
completing or have completed 1 year of treatment in Part B or in Part C. The Extension Phase will 
allow for assessment of long -term effectiven ess, immunogenicity, and safety information in subjec ts 
receiving ALKS  4230 monotherapy or ALKS  4230 in combination with pembrolizumab, while 
minimizing the burden of repeated assessments for subjects and investigators.  
Subjects completing 1 year of treatment will enter the Extension Phase after Cycle 18. The subjects 
who are already beyond 1 year of treatment will enter the Extension Phase immediately and will start 
following the Schedule of Assessments of the Extension Phase ( Table  8). The 1 -year treatment period

Page 8 before the Extension Phase is non -cumulative, ie, in case of rollover from Part A or Part B to Part  C, 
subjects need to complete 1 year of treatment in Part C before entering the Extension Phase.  
Subjects in Part C are eligible to receive combination treatme nt for a maximum of 2 years of treatment 
in total (the initial phase plus the Extension Phase of Part C). Subjects may continue ALKS 4230 a s a 
monotherapy beyond the maximum of 2 years of treatment — both in Part B by continuing treatment 
or in Part C by switching to monotherapy. Subjects will remain on the same dose and schedule when 
entering the Extension Phase. 
Number of Subjects Planned:   
Part A: Approximately 36 to 54 subjects  
Part B: Approximately 42 to 82 subjects with melanoma or RCC Part C: Up to  191 subjects  
Main Criteria for Inclusion:  Eligible subjects must be aged ≥18 years, and the subjects (or the 
subject’s legal representative) must be willing and able to provide informed consent. In Part A, all 
subjects must have an advanced solid tumor (including lymphomas) that is refractory or intolerant to 
established therapies known to provide clinical benefit for the malignancy in question, or be in the 
judgment of their physician intolerant of established therapies. In Parts B and C, all subjects must have 
an advanced solid tumor and have had the minimum prior lines of therapy as defined by the specific cohort into which the subject will enroll. Treatment with prior immunotherapy is permitted, with the 
exception of subjects enrolling into C3, the PD-1/L1 approved tumor types (PD- 1/L1 treatmen t naive) 
cohort, C5, the Melanoma cohort, and C7, the Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Head and Neck cohort 
who are not permitted to have received prior treatment with an anti- PD-1/L1 therapy. For Part A of the 
study, the subject must have a diagnosis of an advanced solid tumor. For Part B of the study, the 
subject must have a diagnosis of melanoma or RCC and meet other inclusion/exclusion criteria 
specified for Part B cohorts. The subject must be ambulatory with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1 and an estimated life expectancy of at least 3 months. Subjects must 
otherwise meet all inclusion/exclusion criteria specified in Section  7. All subjects must be recovered 
from the effects of any previous chemotherapy, immunotherapy, other previous systemic anticancer therapy, radiotherapy, or surgery (ie, toxicity no worse than Grade 1 [Grade 2 alopecia and 
treatment -associated perip heral neuropathy are acceptable]). Subjects in the dose-expansion part  of the 
study (Part B) and in the combination therapy part of the study (Part C) must have at least one lesion 
that qualifies as a target lesion based on RECIST guidelines. 
Subjects must  wait at least 5 half -lives or 4 weeks (whichever is shorter) following prior therapy before 
enrollment into the study. Shorter wait periods may be permitted after discussion with the Medical 
Monitor. Subjects enrolled in the combination therapy part (Part C) of the study must have completed 
the last dose of any broa d spectrum antibiotic at least 30 days prior to first dose (Cycle 1, Day 1).  
For enrollment into Parts B and C, subjects must agree to provide archival tumor tissue biopsy 
sample(s), if availabl e. The archival tumor tissue sample does not have to be obtain ed prior to 
enrollment into the study; however, every effort should be made to submit the archived tissue within 
30 days of study enrollment. 
Subjects should be willing and able to meet contraceptive requirements listed in Section  8.4.2 during 
the study and for 90 days after the last dose (for subjects in Part A and Part B) and 4 months aft er the 
last dose (for subjects in Part C). Females of childbearing potential must have a negative urine or serum 
pregnancy tes t within 7 days of the start of treatment, and on Day 1 before the first dose is 
administered.  
For monotherapy expansion cohorts (Part B) and the combination therapy part of the study (Part C), 
subjects must meet the following criteria to enroll into the cohorts identified below.

Rec
onstituted ALKS 4230 is administered via a 30- minute IV  infusion once daily for 5 consecutive 
days, followed by 9 days off for Cycle 1 (Parts A and B) and 16 days off for all subsequent cycles.  
In Part C, on days where ALKS 4230 is administered in combination with pembrolizumab, 
ALKS  4230 should be administer ed by infusion 60 (±30) minutes after the completion of 
pembrolizumab infusion. 
Pembroli zumab is to be administered as an IV infusion over 30 minutes in a dose of 200 mg every 
3 weeks.  
Sites should make every effort to target infusion timing to be as clos e to 30 minutes as possible for 
either drug. However, given the variability of infusion pumps from site to site, a window 
between -5 minutes and +10 minutes is permitted for ALKS 4230 and pembrolizumab (ie, infusion 
time is 30 minutes [ -5 minutes/+10 minut es]). 
Pembrolizumab is to be obtained from the study sites’ pharmacies, from commercial supplies, or 
provided by Sponsor.  
 
Duration of Treatment: In Parts A and B, Cycle 1 consists of 5 consecutive days of treatment with 
ALKS  4230 followed by 9 days off treatment, for a total of 14 days. Cycle 2 and all subsequent cycles 
of treatment consist of 5 consecutive days of treatment with ALKS 4230 followed by 16 days off 
treatment, for a total of 21 days for each cycle. Subjects may continue additional cycles of  treatment 
until evidence of progressive disease, intolerance to ALKS 4230, removal by the Investigator, 
withdrawal of consent, or any other criteria for study removal. 
In Part C, all cycles of treatment consist of pembrolizumab administration every 3  week s in 
combination with 5 consecutive days of treatment with ALKS 4230 followed by 16 days off treatment, 
for a total of 21 days for each cycle. Subjects may continue additional cycles of treatment until evidence of progressive disease, intolerance to ALKS  4230, removal by the Investigator, withdrawal of 
consent, or any other criteria for study removal. For Part C, subjects who discontinue one drug (eg, due to unacceptable toxicity that cannot be managed by dose modification) must discontinue the entire study treatment.  
In the Extension Phase, the treatment duration of monotherapy with ALKS 4230 may be extended until 
disease progression or until the subject meets any other criteria for treatment discontinuation  
(Section  7.3). Subjects in Part C are eligible to receive combination treatment for a maximum of 
2 years  of treatment in total (the initial phase plus the Extension Phase of Part C) for as long as the 
subject appears to be deriving clinical benefit (ie, objecti ve response or SD) and has tolerated therapy 
well. Subjects may continue ALKS 4230 as a monotherapy beyond the maximum of 2 years of 
treatment — both in Part B by continuing treatment or in Part C by switching to monotherapy, at the 
joint discretion of the  Investigator and Sponsor and if they do not meet any other criteria for 
discontinuation. 
Antitumor  Activit y: Tumor  assessments will be performed throughout study treatment and analyzed 
using RECIST and iRECIST guidelines.

Page 22 5. INTRODUCTION 
Alkermes Inc. (Alkermes) is developing ALKS 4230 for the treatmen t of subjects with advanced 
malignancies.  
Cancer is widely recognized as a prominent cause o f illness and death. Approximately 
14.1 million cancer cases and 8.2 million cancer deaths occurred in 2012 worldwide ( Torre et al, 
2015). It is projected that in the United States in 2015, over 1.6 million new cancer cases wi ll 
arise and over half a million patients will die of the disease ( Siegel et al, 2015 ). 
The potential of immu notherapy to bring clini cal benefit to patients with advanced cancer has 
been recognized for over a century, beginning with the demonstration of activity of Coley’s 
toxins, published in 1893 ( Parish 2003). The field advanced further during the 1980s and 1990s, 
with the FDA granting approval for interferon-α for the treatment of various malignancies intron 
(Intron A USPI ) and interleukin- 2 (IL -2, also known as aldesleukin) for the treatment of 
metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and metastatic melanoma ( Proleukin USPI ). Mor e 
recently there has been substantial progress in the field through the blockade of immune checkpoints using monoclonal antibodies. The firs t of th ese to be approved by the FDA was the 
anticytotoxic T-lymphocyte associated protein-4 antibody ipilimumab, approved for patients 
with unresectable or metastatic melanoma in 2011 and more recently in combination with 
nivolumab for patients with unres ectable or metastatic me lanoma (Yervoy USPI ). The 
antiprogrammed death receptor -1 (PD -1) antibodies pembrolizumab and nivolumab were both 
approved in the United States initially for patients with unresectable or metastatic me lanoma 
who had already r eceived other FDA -approved therapies and then subsequently for patients with 
unresectable or metastatic melanoma and in certain patients with non –small- cell lung cancer 
(NSCLC; Keytruda [pembrolizumab] USPI ; Opdivo [nivolumab] USPI ). Opdivo
® [nivolumab] 
was recently app roved for patients with advanced RCC who have received prior antiangiogenic 
therapy. Despite this progress, many tumors do not respond to PD-1 pathway inhibitor therapy, 
and many subjects who have responded go on to have progression in their tumors. Opport unities 
remain within the field of immunotherapy for novel anticancer agents or novel combinations of 
these agents. Combination of PD-1 pathway inhibition with c ytokine therapy s uch as 
ALKS  4230 might enhance the antitumor effect of anti- PD-1 monotherapy. The first published 
clinical evidence of combination PD-1 pathway inhibition and cytokine therapy came from a study of IL-15 superagonist ALT-803 and nivolumab t reatment, which y ielded encouraging 
antitumor activity in patients with PD -1 pathway inhibitor relapsed and refractory NSCLC 
(Wrangle et al 2018 ). Several clinical studies (eg,  [STUDY_ID_REMOVED], [STUDY_ID_REMOVED], 
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED], and [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) are currently underway to further assess the safety and antitumor activity of combination therapy with these two classes of agents, including a 
combination study of NKTR-214 (a pegylated IL-2) with nivolumab, which has reported 
antitumor re sponses in immunotherapy treatment naive patients ( Diab 2017).  
ALKS 4230 is an engineered fusion protein composed of a circularly permuted IL-2 and IL-2 
receptor (IL -2R) α designed to selectively activate the intermediate- affin ity IL -2R, but not the 
high- affinity IL -2R. The intermediate- affinity IL -2R is expressed predominantly on effector 
lymphocytes, which play an important role in driving antitumor immune responses. In contrast, IL-2 preferentially activates the high -affinity IL -2R, driving the expansion of high- affinity 
IL-2R-expressing cell types including immunosuppressive CD4 + regulatory T cells (T
regs), which 
limit anticancer activity by recombinant human IL -2 (rhIL -2, aldesleukin). The high- affinity 
 Alkermes, Inc.  
Protocol ALK4230-A101 v 13.0 CONFIDENTIAL  
Page 23 IL-2R is also expressed on vascular and pulmonary endothelial cells and may contribute to 
rhIL-2-mediated toxicity via capi llary leak syndrome. Thus, selective activation of the 
intermediate -affinity IL -2R by ALKS 4230 has the potential to provide enhanced tumor killing 
as well as improved safety and tolerability. Pharmacology data supports the thesis that 
ALKS  4230 signals through the intermediate- affinity IL -2R leading to the expansion and 
activation of effector cells while minimizing the expansion and activation of immunosuppressive 
CD4 + T regs. 
ALK4230-A101 is a Phase 1/2 study of ALKS 4230 administered intravenously as monotherapy 
and in combination with pembrolizumab in subjects with advanced solid tumors. 
Based on a minimal anticipated biological effect level dose of 0.1 µg/kg/day and projected 
minimal efficacious dose of 0.7 to 1.6 µg/kg/day, the proposed doses to be evaluated in the Phase 1/2 FIH study by cohort escalation design are 0.1, 0.3, 1, 3, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 14 µg/kg/day. 
If the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) has not been reached within the proposed dose range, 
additional dose escalation will be considered. Following the identification of the RP2D, ALKS  4230 will be evaluated in a dose-expansion phase as monotherapy (Part B).  
In Part C (the combination therapy part of the study), ALKS 4230 will be evaluated at the 1, 3, and 6 μg/kg/day dose levels in combination with pembrolizumab (if a dose higher than 6 μg/kg of ALKS 4230 is found to be tolerable for Part A, that dose may be used in Part C). If the data 
from this initial study are promising, it is expected that ALKS 4230 and/or ALKS 4230 in 
combination with pembrolizumab will progress into further Phase 2 and/or Phase 3 studies. Depending on the data from Phase 1 or later studies, ALKS 4230 may be further tested in studies that combine it with other anticancer agents.  
ALKS 4230 will be studied under IND 128,159. This study will be conducted according to the protocol, Good Clinical Practice (GCP) requirements, and other applicable regulatory requirements.  
5.1. Nonclinical Pharmacology Evaluation  
ALKS 4230 has been studied using in vitro  and in vivo  nonclinical methods to characterize its 
pharmacology. Results from selected studies are briefly described below. 
5.1.1. In Vitro Primary Pharmacology 
ALKS 4230 was designed to selectively bind to and activate the intermediate- affinity IL -2R, and 
not the high- affinity IL -2R. The potency of activation of the intermediate- affinity IL -2R and 
high- affinity IL -2R by ALKS 4230 relative to rhIL-2 was evaluated

5.2. Nonclinical Pharmacokinetic Evaluation  
The pharmacokinetics (PK) of ALKS 4230 were determined in male cynomolgus monkeys after 
single intravenous (IV) administration (Study Number AK -4230-01) at 0.03, 0.1, or 0.3 mg/kg. 
After a  single IV bolus administration, the PK of ALKS 4230 was characterized by a mean 
serum clearance of 11.9 to 16.6 mL/h/kg and mean steady-state volume of distribution of 80 to 138 mL/kg. The mean elimination half-life ranged from 20 to 34 hours and the mean residence time ranged from 6.7 to 8.2 hours. Systemic exposure to ALKS 4230 (maximum drug 
concentration in serum [C
max] and area under the curve from time zero to infinity) increased with 
increase in dose; the increase in area under the curve from time ze ro to infinity appeared to be 
slightly less than dose proportional over the dose range of 0.03 to 0.3 mg/kg. 
The toxicokinetics of ALKS 4230 and anti-ALKS 4230 antibody data were det ermined in cluster 
of differentiation (CD)-1 mice and cynomolgus monkeys a s part of the pivotal repeat -dose 
toxicity studies.  
After QD IV (30 -second infusion) administration of ALKS 4230 to CD-1 mice for up to 
28 consecutive days in the repeat -dose pivotal toxicity study, ALKS 4230 exposures (C max and 
area under the curve from t ime zero to 24 hours postdose) increased with increase in dose; the 
increase in exposures was generally dose proportional over the dose range of 0.03 to 
0.3 mg/kg/day. No sex difference in ALKS 4230 exposures and no accumulation of ALKS 4230 was observed i n CD- 1 mice after repeat -dose administration of ALKS 4230. Overall, 31 out of 
the 90 toxicity animals (34.4%) dosed with ALKS 4230 tested positive for anti- ALKS  4230 
antibodies. The direct impact of anti -ALKS 4230 antibody development on ALKS 4230 
toxicokinetics could not be determined as the presence of anti-ALKS 4230 antibodies were evaluated in samples collected from the toxicity animals and not from the toxicokinetic animals.  
After IV (30 -minute infusion) administration of ALKS 4230 to cynomolgus monkeys QD for 
35 consecutive days or for a total of 15 doses (3 cycles of daily dosing for 5 days followed by 
9 days of no dosing) in the pivotal repeat-dose toxicity study, ALKS 4230 exposures (C
max and 
area under the curve from time zero to 24.5 hours postdos e) increased with the increase in dose. 
The increase in ALKS 4230 exposures was generally dose proportional over the dose range of 1 to 30 µg/kg/day evaluated in the daily dosing regimen and over the dose range of 10 to 
300 µg/kg/day evaluated in the cycle dosing regimen with the exception of a greater than dose proportional increase in ALKS 4230 exposure from 100 to 300 µg/kg/day in male monkeys. No 
sex difference in ALKS 4230 exposures and no accumulation of ALKS 4230 were observed in 
monkeys after repeat -dose administration of ALKS 4230. Overall, 11 out of the 40 animals 
(27.5%) dosed with ALKS 4230 tested positive for anti-ALKS 4230 antibodies. However, the 
presence of anti -ALKS 42 30 antibodies in animals that were positive for anti-ALKS 4230 
antibodies did not appear to impact the ALKS 4230 concentration profile or exposure. Also, the 
prevalence of anti -ALKS 4230 antibodies did not appear to be dose related. 
The starting dose for the ALKS 4230 FIH Phase 1/2 clinical study is proposed to be 0.1 µg/kg based upon the minimal anticipated biological effect level approach recommended by the 

 Alkermes, Inc.  
Protocol ALK4230-A101 v 13.0 CONFIDENTIAL  
Page 26 regulatory agency ICH Guidance: S9 Nonclinical Evaluation ( International Council for 
Harmonisation 2010). This starting dose is projected to result in an immediate postinfusion 
concentration (C max) of 0.0031 µg/mL. The projected minimal efficacious dose  in humans for 
activation of IL-2R complex ranges from 0.7 to 1.6 µg/kg and is projected to result in a C max 
range of 0.016 to 0.038 µg/mL. Therefore, the proposed doses to be evaluated in the FIH Phase 1/2 study are 0.1, 0.3, 1, 3, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 14 µg/kg. In comparison, the no-observed-adverse- effect –level for the cycle dos ing regimen in the pivotal repeat-dose 
toxicology study in monkeys is 100 µg/kg; the observed C
max on the last day of dosing was 
2.43 µg/mL in males and 2.61 µg/mL in females. In addition, the C max at the proposed starting 
dose of 0.1 µg/kg (0.0031 µg/mL) is about 3-fold lower than the lowest concentration of 
ALKS  4230 (0.01 µg/ mL) tested in the ProStorm® Cytokine Release Assays at which only slight 
elevations were observed for IL -6, IL -8, and interferon-γ in a small number of donor samples, 
similar to those in the low -response control across the concentration range evaluated. Th erefore, 
0.1 µg/kg is considered a safe starting dose for the FIH study. If the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or the RP2D has not been reached within the proposed dose range, additional dose escalation will be considered.  
5.3. Nonclinical Toxicology Studies  
5.3.1. General Toxicology Studies 
The nonclinical toxicology studies were carried out to evaluate ALKS 4230 safety and to inform the selection of a safe FIH starting dose. Relevant species sele ction was contingent on 
exploratory pharmacology work. Species used in the general toxicology program were CD-1 mice and cynomolgus monkeys for rodent and nonrodent species, respectively. 
Targets/target organs identified in general toxicology studies included lung, liver, and spleen as 
noted with microscopic pathology. Mortality was seen in nonpivotal dose range-finding in CD-1 
mice at 0.6 mg/kg/day, the pivotal CD-1 mouse study at 0.3 mg/kg/day, and in the pivotal 
monkey study at 0.3 mg/kg/day. Clinical observations of hypoactivity, inappetence, and gastrointestinal effects (vomiting, soft feces) were noted in monkeys at doses ≥0.3 mg/kg/day. 
Mortality in mice and monkeys was attributed to lung findings of mononuclear cell infiltrate in 
mouse at ≥0.3 mg/kg/day and moderate hemorrhage peribronchial/perivascular in the 1 monkey death at 0.3 mg/kg/day. 
5.3.2. In Vivo General Toxicology 
In toxicology studies in both mouse and monkey, ALKS 4230 target organs were lung, liver, and 
spleen. Increased lymphocytic and/or mononuclear cell infiltrations were observed in the Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) and non-GLP studies in both species. Mononuclear cell infiltrates 
were noted in other tissues as well but without clinical pathology or clinical observations. These findings were not considered adverse in animals receiving low doses of ALKS 4230 beca use 
these animals survived to termination and the extent of cellular infiltration was reduced during 
recovery. In mice treated at higher doses, fatalities were attributed to cellular  infiltration in the 
lungs. One female monkey died early in the GLP study. Her death was attributed to moderate 
peribronchial/perivascular hemorrhage in the lung. The no- observed -adverse- effect –level  in 
mouse was determined to be 0.1 mg/kg/day. The no -obse rved-adverse- effect –level  in monkey 
 Alkermes, Inc.  
Protocol ALK4230-A101 v 13.0 CONFIDENTIAL  
Page 27 was determined to be 0.001/0.03 mg/kg/day for daily dosing and 0.1 mg/kg/day for cyclical 
dosing. 
Systemic exposure is dose-dependent in both animal species. In the GLP monkey study, 
formation of anti-ALKS 4230 antibodies did not alter serum PK or toxicokinetic profiles. 
ALKS 4230 exposure in the GLP studies of mouse and monkey are more than 700-fold higher 
than the exposure that is expected in the FIH Phase 1/2 study at the starting dose of 0.1 μg/kg/day. This dose is projected to deliver a postinfusion concentration (C
max) of 
0.0031 μg/mL.

7.3. Subject D iscontinuation From Treatment  
A subject may choose to withdraw or may be discontinued from treatment at any time if the 
subject, Investigator, or Sponsor determines that it is not in the best interest of the subject to 
continue participation. Reasons for withdrawal or discontinuation include: 
• Unacceptable toxicity that cannot be managed by dose modification 
• Pregnancy  
• Immune confirmed progressive disease (iCPD) by iRECIST or clinical progression (worsening of symptoms or declining performance status) 
• Severe noncompliance as judged by the Investigator and/or Sponsor 
• Study terminated by Sponsor 
• Subject request (Note: All reasonable efforts should be made to encourage subjects to remain on study for follow-up evaluations even if they withdraw from treatment) 
• Physician’s decision  
• Death  
For Part C, subjects who discontinue 1 drug (eg, due to unacceptable toxicity that cannot be managed by dose modification) must discontinue the entire study treatment. 
Subjects who request to discontinue treatment will be asked to continue the study visits and 
assessments as outlined in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 5, Table 6, Table 7, and Table 8). 
The ET/EOT v isits must be completed for all subjects regardless of whether they actually return 
to the clinic for those visits. However, if a subject completes Cycle 9 and is then lost to follow-up or withdraws consent, the site must complete the ET/EOT as well as end of study (EOS) CRFs accordingly. 
7.4. Subject Discontinuation From Study  
Subjects may be discontinued from the study for any of the following reasons: 
• With drawal of consent by the subject, who is at any time free to discontinue his or her 
participation in the study 
• Death  
• Lost to follow-up 
• Sponsor decision to terminate study 
If a subject withdraws or is discontinued from the study for any reason, any ongoing 
treatment -related AEs will be followed until resolution, until deemed stable by the Investigator, 
or until the subject is deemed by the Investigator to be lost to follow-up.  
In the event that a subject chooses to withdraw from the study, the Investigator should make a 
reasonable effort to ascertain the reason(s) for withdrawal, while fully respecting the subject’s 
 Alkermes, Inc.  
Protocol ALK4230-A101 v 13.0 CONFIDENTIAL  
Page 36 rights. Enrolled subjects are to be asked to return to the clinic for an early termination visit. The 
early termination visit should be scheduled as close as possible to the subject’s last dose and will 
mimic the assessments scheduled to be conducted at the end of treatment (EOT) visit. Subjects who withdraw from or are discontinued from the study will also be asked to complete the safety 
follow-up visits. The EOS visits must be completed for all subjects regardless of whether they 
actually return to  the clinic for those visits. For example, if a subject completes Cycle 9 and is 
then lost to follow-up or withdraws consent, the site must still compl ete the EOS CRF 
accordingly. 
If the subject fails or refuses to return to the study center, an attempt must be made to contact the 
subject by telephone to assess as many safety and antitumor activity parameters as possible. If a 
subject is lost to follow-up, attempts should be made to contact the subject to determine the 
reason for discontinuation. For subjects who are lost to follow- up, at least 3  documented 
attempts, including one via certified mail, should be made to contact the subject before 
considering the subject lost to follow-up. 
The Investigator must maintain a record of all subjects who fail to complete the study. A full explanation of the reason for study withdrawal or discontinuation will be made on the 
appropriate electronic case report  form (eCRF). The reason for discontinuation will be 
documented. 
7.5. Replacement of Subjects  
In the dose- escalation p art of the study, subjects without a DLT who receive fewer than 10 doses 
through Cycle 2, Day 15 (C2D15) will be considered unevaluable for DLT assessment and will 
be replaced at the same dose level if the minimum number of evaluable subjects has not been reached for the cohort. However, the subject may remain in the study if the Investigator feels the 
risk/benefit ratio is acc eptable. There will be no replacements of subjects other than subjects who 
are considered unevaluable for DLT assessment.  
Subjects w ho discontinue for any reason, including disease progression, prior to the completion 
of the C2D15 visit in the dose-expansion part of the study (Part B) or in the combination therapy 
part of the study (Part C) will be replaced.  
Data from subjects who are replaced will be included in the data analysis.

Page 37 8. STUDY DESIGN  
8.1. Overall Study Design and Plan  
This is a global, multicenter, o pen-label, sequential groups Phase 1/2 study. The study will have 
three parts: Part A, a dose-escalation monotherapy part; Part B, a dose-expansion monotherapy 
part; and Part  C, a combination therapy part with pembrolizumab.  
In Part A of the study, subjects with advanced solid tumors will receive ALKS 4230 by IV administration daily for 5 days, followed by a period off treatment in repeating cycles. During 
Cycle 1, the period off treatment will be 9 days, resulting in a cycle length of 14 days (2 weeks). 
Cycle 2 and subsequent cycles will have a period off treatment of 16 days, resulting in a cycle length of 21 days (3 weeks). For the first 2 treatment cycles, subjects will receive ALKS  4230 as 
inpatients at a medical facility with access to medical support measures and to the intensive care unit, if needed. In the absence of DLTs, subjects who remain in the study may receive subsequent doses of ALKS 4230 on an outpatient basis. 
In dose escalation, cohorts in the study will use a standard 3+3 study design with 3 to 6 subjects 
per cohort to receive ALKS 4230 at dose levels described in Figure 1. Th e starting dose of 
0.1 µg/kg/day was selected based on minim al anticipated biological effect level. Doses in 
subsequent cohorts will be increased according to Table 1 until stopped for DLTs or an MTD is 
reached. Additional dose levels will be considered if the RP2D or MTD has not been reached 
within the proposed dose range.  
During dose escalation, each cohort will be evaluated for safety and tolerability using a 
3+3 study design with allowance for over- enrollment wi th 4 to 7 subjects and a minimum of 
3 evaluable subjects per cohort to receive IV ALKS 4230 at the specified dose and schedule. If 
none of the 3 subjects experiences a DLT, then the next dose level will open for enrollment. If 
1 of the 3 subjects experi ences a DLT, then 3 additional subjects will be enrolled at the same 
dose level. If no additional DLTs are observed, then the next dose level will open for enrollment. 
If 2 or more subjects experience DLTs at a dose level, no further dose escalations will occur. 
One or more lower dose level(s) may be tested in search of the MTD, defined as the dose level immediately below that in which ≥2 of 6 evaluable subjects experience DLTs. Prior to any dose 
escalation, a teleconference of the Safety Review Committee ( SRC), to include at a minimum the 
study investigators who have enrolled subjects and the Sponsor’s Medical Monitor, will be 
convened to review the safety data from the current cohort and to decide if dose escalation is warranted.

Page 39 If dose e scalation is not felt to be warranted, an intermediate dose between the current dose and 
the prior dose may be explored. Alternative dosing frequency (dosing less than 5 consecutive 
days in each treatment cycle) may also be explored depending on safety, PK, and pharmacodynamic observations during the dose-escalation portion of the study. 
Dose -limiting toxicity will be defined by any of the following events possibly, probably, or 
definitely related to ALKS 4230 that are observed during the interval from Cycle 1, Day 1 
through C2D15: 
• Grade 4 Neutrophil Count Decreased (neutropenia) that has not recovered to Grade 2 (≥1000 cells/µL) within 15 days of the start of the cycle or requires an urgent 
intervention (eg, use of hematopoietic colony- stimulating factors) or is associated 
with clin ically significant infection. Dosing with ALKS 4230 in the current cycle will 
not be stopped due to neutropenia in the absence of urgent intervention or clinically 
significant infection.  
• Febrile neutropenia (ANC <1000 cells/µL with temperature >38.3°C [100.9°F]) that persists for more than 48 hours or requires an urgent intervention (eg, use of hematopoietic colony- stimulating factors) or is associated with clinically significant 
infection  
• CTCAE Grade 4 thrombocytopenia that does not recover to Grade ≤2 within 15 days 
of the start of the treatment cycle  
• Thrombocytopenia equivalent to a platelet count <30,000 with clinically significant 
bleeding 
• Any Grade 3 c ardiac or central nervous system toxicity  
• Liver transaminase elevation hig her than 8 × ULN that does not recover to Grade ≤2 
or baseline within 1 week or total bilirubin higher than 6 × ULN that does not recover to Grade ≤2 or baseline within 1 week 
• Grade 4 hypoalbuminemia 
• Fever >40°C (>104°F) sustained for >24 hours 
• Hypotension requiring the use of pressors (eg, phenylephrine or dopamine, administered for the purpose of increasing blood pressure) or prolonged hospitalization (>48 hours) for hypotension requiring medical intervention 
• Grade 3 or higher electrolyte abnormalities th at do not recover to Grade ≤1 within 
48 hours following medical management 
• Increase in amylase or lipase that meets one of the following criteria:  
− Asymptomatic Grade 4 elevation  
− Asym ptomatic Grade 3 elevation that does not resolve within 14 days 
− >3× ULN wi th acute severe abdominal pain (other mild symptoms at Grade 3 will 
not be considered as DLTs)

Protocol ALK4230-A101 v 13.0 CONFIDENTIAL  
Page 40 • Grade 3 or higher nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea lasting longer than 48 hours despite 
maximum supportive care. 
• Any other Grade 4 nonhematologic toxicity or any other Grade 3 non- hematologic 
toxicity that does not resolve to Grade ≤ 2 within 96 hours, except fatigue or anorexia. Fatigue and anorexia are not considered DLTs. 
• Any other toxicity or AE not defined above that results in subject removal from the study or discontinuation of dosing by the Investigator. Dose delays during Cycle 2 or later are not considered DLTs.  
Any laboratory value that meets the DLT criteria as described above must be confirmed with a second laboratory result for DLT criteria to be met. 
Subjects without a DLT who receive fewer than 10 doses through C2D15 will be replaced at the 
same dose level if the minimum number of evaluable subjects has not been reached for the 
cohort. However, the subject may remain in the study if the Investigator fee ls the risk/benefit 
ratio is acceptable.  
Under certain circumstances an individual subject may be permitted to have his/her dose 
escalated (ie, intrapatient dose escalation). Refer t o Section  9.6 for further deta ils. 
Subjects may remain on treatment until criteria for treatment discontinuation are met as described in Section  7.3. Subjects may remain on study until criteria for study discontinuation 
are met as described i n Section  7.4. Note: all reasonable efforts should be made to encourage 
subjects to remain on study for follow-up evaluations even if they withdraw from treatment. For Part C, subjects who discontinue 1 drug (eg, due to unacceptable toxicity that cannot be managed by dose modification) must discontinue the entire study treatment. 
In the Extension Phase, the treatment duration of monotherapy with ALKS 4230 may be 
extended until disease progression or until the subje ct meets any other criteria for treatment 
discontinuation ( Section  7.3). Subjects in Part C are eligible to receive combinat ion treatment for 
a maximum of 2 years of treatment in total (the initial phase plus the  Extension Phase of Part C) 
for as long as the subject appears to be deriving clinical benefit (ie, objective response or SD) 
and has tolerated therapy well. Subjects m ay continue ALKS 4230 as a monotherapy beyond the 
maximum of 2 years of treatment — both in Part B by continuing treatment or in Part C by 
switching to monotherapy, at the joint discretion of the Investigator and Sponsor and if they do 
not meet any other criteria for discontinuation. 
An interim review of the safety data to guide the selection  of the RP2D is planned prior to the 
start of Part B of the study using data from subjects enrolled in Part A. After the RP2D is determined, the second part of the study (ie, Part B) will begin. In this part of 
the study, up to 41 subjects with melanoma (including no more than 5 ocular melanoma subjects) and up to 41 subjects with RCC may be enrolled  to receive ALKS  4230 at the RP2D. Enrollment 
to these cohorts will follow a PR (unconfirmed) Simon’s two-stage design enrollment as outlined in Table 2. Response assessments will be based on the RECIST guidelines.

a No more than 5 ocular melanoma subjects may be enr olled into this cohort.  
The RP2D will be equal to or less than the MTD and its associated dosing schedule and will be 
selected based on the safety, PK, pharmacodynamics, and preliminary antitumor activity data observed during dose escalation. 
An independent data monitoring committee (IDMC) will review accumulating safety and 
efficacy data at regular intervals  and monitor overall study conduct beginning in the second stage 
(N2) of Part B cohorts and Part C C5, C6, and C7 cohorts (see Section  14.6 for detail s). 
In the third part of the study (Part C), subjects will receive ALKS 4230 in combination with pembrolizumab. Part C will run independently of and concurrently with monotherapy Part A and Part B.  
A 3- to 6-subje ct run -in phase will be utilized to assess  the safety of ALKS 4230 in combination 
with pembrolizumab. During the safety run-in phase, subjects may be enrolled with any tumor 
type as described in the nonrollover cohorts. Rollover subjects (Cohort 4) are not eligible to 
participate in the safety run -in phase of Part C.  
During the safety run-in phase, the first 3 subjects will receive ALKS 4230 at the dose level of 
1 µg/kg/day. The first subject enrolled at the 1 µg/kg/day dose level will be monitored as a 
sentinel subject. This sentinel subject will be observed for safety for a period of 7 days (the 
sentinel period) from first dose of ALKS 4230. If the sentinel subject tolerates treatment 
adequately during this period, then up to 2 additional subjects may be enrolled into the 
1 µg/kg/day dose level. If all 3 subjects tolerate therapy adequately through their first 21-day cycle as assessed by the SRC, then the study will progress to the 3 µg/kg/day dose level. At the 
discretion of the SRC, an additional 3 subjec ts may be enrolled at the 1  μg/kg/day dose level to 
further assess safety prior to opening enrollment at the 3 μg/kg/day dose level. 
Once the safety run -in phase at the 1 µg/kg/day dose level is complete and the SRC has agreed to 
proceed to the 3 µg/kg/day dose level, the first subject will be enrolled at the 3  µg/kg/day dose 
level and will be observed for 7 days as a sentinel subject. If this subject tolerates treatment 
adequately for 7 days, then up to 2 additional subjects may be enrolled in the following week. If 
the second and third subjects tolerate the 3 µg/kg/day dose level adequately for 7 days, then 
3 additional subjects can be enrolled beginning the following week.  
If the first 6 subjects tolerate therapy adequately for their first 21 -day cycle as assessed by the 
SRC, then enrollment into expansion Cohorts C1, C2, C3, and C4 will be open without 
restriction in the rate of enrollment at the dose determined by the SRC.

Page 42 Up to 20 subjects will be enrolled into each of Cohorts C1, C2, C3 based on their tumor type and 
prior t reatment with PD -1/PD-L1 pathway inhibitors as described in the inclusion criteria. 
Subjects with RCC or melanoma will not be eligible for enrollment in Cohorts C1, C2, or C3. Subjects on ALKS 4230 monotherapy in Part A or Part B who have experienced disease progression after a minimum of 2 cycles or SD after a minimum of 4 cycles and who are expected to tolerate treatment with combination therapy are eligible for treatment in Part C, Cohort C4. Subjects who have PR or CR on monotherapy are ineligible to rollover unless subsequently demonstrating progressive disease. 
Subjects will receive  200 mg of pembrolizumab every 3 weeks in combination with ALKS 4230 
by IV administration daily for 5 days, followed by a period off treatment of 16 days, resulting in 
a cycle length of 21 days (3 weeks) for each cycle.  
Once a RP2D is determined for monotherapy, enrollment into Cohorts C5, C6, and C7 will open. 
Should monotherapy doses above 6 µg/kg/day ALKS 4230 be shown to be tolerated, then the dose of ALKS 4230 in the combination arms may be increased. In Cohorts C5, C6, and C7, up to 53 subjects with melanoma, up to 42 subjects with NSCLC, and up to 36 subjects with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck may be enrolled to receive ALKS 4230 in  combination with 
pembrolizumab at the RP2D. Enrollment to these cohorts will follow a PR (unconfirmed) Simon’s two -stage enrollment as outlined below. Response assessments will be based on

Extension Phase (Part B and Part C Only) 
An Ext ension Phase is planned for subjects receiving clinical benefit fro m the treatment who are 
completing or have completed 1 year of treatment in Part B or in Part C. The Extension Phase 
will allow for assessment of long -term effectiveness, immunogenicity, an d safety information in 
subjects receiving ALKS 4230 monotherapy or ALKS  4230 in combination with 
pembrolizumab, while minimizing the burden of repeated assessments for subjects and investigators. 
Subjects completing 1 year of treatment will enter the Exte nsion Phase after Cycle 18. The 
subjects who are already beyond 1 year of treatment will enter the Extension Phase immediately 
and will start following the Schedule of Assessments of the Extension Phase ( Table 8 ). The 
1-year treatment period before the Extension Phase is non-cumulative, ie, in case of rollover 
from Part A or Part B to Part  C, subjects need to complete 1 year of treatment in Part C before 
entering the Extension Phase.  
Subjects in Part C are eligible  to receive combination treatment for a maximum of 2 years of 
treatment in total (the initial phase plus the Extension  Phase of Part C). Subjects may continue 
ALKS 4230 as a monotherapy beyond the maximum of 2 years of treatment - both in Part B by 
continuin g treatment or in Part C by switching to monotherapy. Subjects will remain on the same 
dose and schedule when entering the Extension Phase.

d During dosing in Cycle 1 and Cycle 2, vital signs should be collected pretreatment, during the infusion, at end of infusion, and after t he infusion at the 
following time points: 0.5 hour (±15 minutes), 1 hour (±15 minute s), 2 hours (±15 minutes ), 3 hours (±15  minutes), 4 hours (±15 minutes), 6 hours 
(±15  minutes), 8  hours (±15 minutes), 12 hours (±15 minutes), and 16 hours (±15 minutes). For Cycle 3 and beyond, vital signs are to be collected during the 
following time points: pretreatment, middle of infusion, end of infusion; and after the infusion at the following time points: 0.5 hour (±15 minutes), 1 hour (±15 
minutes), and 2 hours (±15 minutes). Blood pressure, puls e, and respiratory rate should be measured after the subject has been resting in a seated or supine 
position for at least 5 minutes. Section  8.3.6 for further details.  
e These assessments are performed if t he subject is hospitalized for monitoring due to neutropenia as per protocol. Subjects who are being monitored for 
neutropenia may be discharged from the hospital when they  have recovered per guidance in protocol Section  9.7. 
f Height is to be done only at screening. For the Day 1 visit, weight may be recorded up to 72 hours prior to Day 1.  
g Triplicate ECG to be obtained on Cycle 1 Day 1, Day 5, and Day 8. Timing for ECG assessments is provided in Section  8.3.8 . 
h Single ECGs to be obtained at screening, on Day 1 of each subsequent cycle (Cycle 2 and beyond), and at EOT visit. Timing for ECG assessments is provided 
in Section  8.3.8 . 
i Blood and urine samples for laboratory assess ment will be collected. On do sing days, samples must be collected prior to dosing. For Cycle 1 Day 1, blood and 
urine assessment does  not need to be repeated if performed at screening within 7 days of Cycle 1 Day 1. Samples for laboratory assessments may be drawn up 
to 72 hours prior to dosing on Day 1. See Section  8.3.10, Table  10 for assessments.  
j Serum tumor m arkers as appropriate. After Cycle 2, done only for even -numbered treatment cycles (eg, Cycles 4, 6, etc). See Section  8.3.10  for ass essments.  
k A preg nancy test (urine or serum) must be given to all women of childbearing potential before each treatment cycle begins. Pregnanc y test r esults must be 
confirmed as negative before the first dose of each cycle is administered for all cycles. Pregnancy testing may be performed up to 72 hours prior to dosing on 
Day 1.  
l Tumor imaging should include all appropriate radiographic procedures to document the full extent  of the subject’s known disease according to RECIST and 
iRECIST guidelines. Assessments are to be done at the end of Cycle 2 but before the next treatment cycle. For subsequent cycles, assessments are to be done at 
the end of each even -numbered treatment cycle (eg, Cycles 4, 6) but before the next treatment cycle. Tumor imaging should be done during the last week of the 
cycle. 
m Subjects will have tumor imag ing scans every 9 weeks during the Follow- up Assessment Period (until the subject discontinues from the study or starts a new 
therapy).  
n ALKS 4230 will be given daily for Day 1 to 5 for each treatment cycle. For Cycles 1 and 2 for all  dosing levels, all doses will be administered to subjects as 
inpatients at a medical facility with access to medical support measures and to the intensive care unit, if ne eded. Discharge is typically on Day 6 for Cycles 1 
and 2. Dosing in subsequent cycles may be done as an outpatient. Anytime  ALKS 4230 is administered, antipyretics should be administered prior (at least 
15 minutes) to the infusion and should only be withheld at the discretion of the Investigator.  
o PK samples will be  collected on Day 1 and Day 5 of Cycle 1 and Cycle 2 at predose, at the completion of the infusion, and 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16 hours afte r the start 
of the infusion. Additional samples will be collected at predose on Days  2 through 4 and on Day 6 (24 hours post Day 5 dosing), Day 8 (Cycle 1 and Cycle 2), 
and Day 15 (Cycle 2 only). All 16- hour samples and the Day 6 (ie, Day 5, 24 hour) sample are optional. For Cycle 3 and beyond, all PK samples will be 
collected at predose and at the end of the infusion on Days 1, 3, and 5. All PK samples should be drawn from the arm opposite of the arm used to infuse study 
drug. Do not take PK samples from a  central line used to infuse study drug. Details regarding PK sample draw windows are provided in Table  11 in

g Single ECG to be obtained. Timing for ECG assessments is provided in Section 8.3.8 . 
h Blood and urine samples for laboratory assessment will be collected. On dosing days, samples must be collected prior to dosing  (predose samples should be 
collected prior to first administration of any study drug, either pembrolizumab or ALKS 4230). For Cycle 1 Day 1, blood and uri ne assessments do not need to 
be repeated if performed at screening within 7 days of Cycle 1 Day 1. Samples for laboratory assessments may be drawn up to 72 hours prior to dosing on 
Day 1. See Section 8.3.10 , Table 10 for assessments. 
i In the event of Grade 4 neutropenia (where ANC <100/µL) or Grade 3 or higher febrile neutropenia the subject should be hospita lized for monitoring and 
assessments, managed as described in Section 9.7 . 
j After Cycle 2, done only for even-numbere d treatment cycle (eg, Cycles 4, 6, etc). 
k A pregnancy test (urine or serum) must be given to all women of childbearing potential before each treatment cycle begins. Pre gnancy test results must be 
confirmed as negative before the first dose  of each cycle is administered for all cy cles. Pregnancy testing may be performed up  to 72 hours prior to dosing on 
Day 1. 
l Tumor imaging should include all appropriate radiographic procedures to document the full extent of the subject’s known diseas e according to RECIST and 
iRECIST guidelines. For those subjects in the Part C rollover coho rt (Cohort 4), who were initially enrolled into study Part A or Part B, the baseline tumor 
image is reset to for Part C will be the screening scan for Part C (not the previous screening scan from Part A or Part B). Ass essments are to be done at the end 
of Cycle 2 but before the next treatment cycle. For subsequent cycles, assessments are to be done at the end of each even-numbered treatment cycle (eg, Cycles 
4, 6) but before the next treatment cycle. Tumor imagin g should be done during the last week of the cycle. 
m Subjects will have tumor imaging scans every 9 weeks during the Follow-up Assessment Period (until the subject discontinues fr om the study or starts a new 
therapy).

8.3.12. Tumor Imaging and Disease Assessments 
Disease assessments will be made at the time point(s) specifie d in Table 5, Table 6, Table 7, and 
Table 8. Assessments will be based on Investigator review of t he radiographic or photographic 
images as defined by RECIST and iRECIST. Tumor images wil l be collected and stored 
centrally. Centralized readings may be used to assess scans beginning in the second stage (N2) of 
Part B cohorts and Part C C5, C6, and C 7 cohorts. 
8.3.13. Adverse Event Monitoring  
Adverse events will be collected from the time a subject signs the informed consent document 
until the completion of the final study visit (see Table  5, Table 6, Table 7, and Table 8) . Adverse 
events and serious AEs (SAEs) are defined in Section  13.1 and Section  13.2, respectively.

Protocol ALK4230-A101 v 13.0 CONFIDENTIAL  
Page 70 Section  13.4 provides guidance on the monitoring and reporting requirements for AEs. 
Section  13.5 provides guidance on the reporting requirements for SAEs. 
See Section  8.1 for the monitoring and definitions of DLTs. 
8.3.14. Tumor Tissue Assessments (Opt ional) 
Biopsies of tumors in subjects with accessible lesions are taken at baseline and at time points 
specified in Table 5, Table 6, and Table 7. This is optional for subjects.  
The on-treatment biopsy should be t aken  at the same site as the baseline biopsy if feasible.  
8.4. Study Requirements and Restrictions  
8.4.1. Inpatient Treatment  
All subjects participating in the dose -escalation (Part A) portion of the study will stay at a 
medical facility with immediate access to inten sive care unit and medical support measures for 
the dosing days of the first 2 cycles of therapy and will be discharged 24 hours after the last dose if medically stable. This will apply to all subjects at each dose level in the dose -escalation 
portion of t he protocol. If a subject experiences an AE/SAE of concern to the Investigator or a 
DLT in any cycle, the Investigator may choose to administer the next dose or next cycle of doses in an inpatient setting, if continued dosing is deemed appropriate for that subject. In the absence 
of any of the events that define a DLT, subjects may receive subsequent cycles after Cycl e 2 of 
ALKS  4230 in an outpatient setting. Dosing in subsequent cycles may also be administered to 
subjects as inpatients, if necessary based on the opinion of the Investigator.  
Inpatient treatment and observation are not mandatory for Part B or Part C of the study. 
Subjects should be hospitalized for monitoring (for either Part A, Part B, or Part C) in the event 
of Grade 4 neutropenia (where A NC < 100/µL) or Grade 3 or higher febrile neutropenia, as 
outlined in Section  9.7. 
Any subject in any part of the study may be admitted to the hospital for observation and safety monitoring at any time during the study if the I nvestigator believes it to be in the best interest of 
the subject.  
8.4.2. Contraception and Pregnancy  
All WOCBP and all men (if their sexual partners are WOCBP) must use at least two methods of contraception, at least one of which is considered highly e ffective, during the study and 90 days 
after the final dose of study drug (for subjects in Part A and Part B) or 4 months after the final dose of study drug (for subjects in Part C), if heterosexually active. A woman is considered as a WOCBP (fertile) foll owing menarche and until becoming postmenopausal unless permanently 
sterile. Permanent sterilization methods include total hysterectomy and/or bilateral salpingectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy. A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an alternative medical cause. A high follicle -stimulating hormone (FSH) 
level in the postmenopausal range may be used to confirm a postmenopausal state in women not using hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement therapy. However, in the absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, a single FSH measurement is insufficient. A man is considered fertile after puberty unless permanently sterile by bilateral orchiectomy. 
 Alkermes, Inc.  
Protocol ALK4230-A101 v 13.0 CONFIDENTIAL  
Page 71 Highly effective methods of contraception include the following: 
• Combined (containing estrogen and progestogen) hormonal contraception associated 
with inhibition of ovulation. Delivery may be oral, intravaginal, or transdermal. 
• Progestogen-only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation. Delivery may be oral, injectable, or impla ntable.  
• Intrauterine device  
• Intrauterine hormone- releasing system  
• Bilateral tubal ligation or occlusion  
• Bilateral vasectomy (provided that the male has a medical assessment of surgical success)  
• True sexual abstinence (defined as refraining fr om h eterosexual intercourse during 
the entire period of risk, in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject) 
All female subjects of childbearing potential will receive a pregnancy test (serum or urine) at screening and a negative result mus t be confirmed  before the first dose in each cycle of 
treatment. If a subject becomes pregnant while participating in the study, she will be 
discontinued from study drug immediately. The early termination and safety follow- up visits will 
be scheduled and t he pregnancy w ill be reported to Alkermes. Pregnancies in female partners of 
male subjects should also be reported and will be followed in the same manner. Additional 
follow-up may be required. 
In the event of a pregnancy, a Pregnancy Report Form must be submi tted to Alkermes (fax 
number in Section  13.5) within 24 hours of awareness of the pregnancy, irrespective of whether 
an AE has occurred. The pregnancy will be followed until completion or termination. If the 
outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for classification as an SAE it should be reported following the SAE procedure (see Section  13.5).  
8.4.3. Concomitant and Prohibited Medications  
All intercurrent medical condi tions will be treated at the discretion of the Investigator according 
to acceptable community standards of medical care. All concomitant medic ations and treatments 
will be documented on the eCRF. 
The following treatments are not permitted during the study: 
• Any other investigational treatment  
• Any other systemic antineoplastic therapy including, but not limited to, cytotoxic 
chemotherapy, immunotherapy, targeted agents, hormonal therapy (except luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone antagonists or agonists for pro state cancer started at least 
3 months before Cycle 1, Day 1 of ALKS 4230) or monoclonal antibody therapy 
• Radiotherapy, including systemic ally administered radioisotopes; only palliative 
radiotherapy to a nontarget lesion is allowed at the discretion of th e Medical Monitor 
 Alkermes, Inc.  
Protocol ALK4230-A101 v 13.0 CONFIDENTIAL  
Page 72 • Hematopoietic growth factors. In Part A, hematopoietic growth factors are prohibited 
during the DLT evaluation period. A t all other times in Part A, and at all time in 
Parts  B and C, hematopoietic growth factors may be used as clinica lly indicated.  
• Pharmacologic doses of corticosteroids (greater than 10 mg of prednisone daily, or 
equivalent); topical, ophthalmological, and inhalational corticosteroids are permitted. 
Use of glucocorticoids for the purpose of treating immune- mediated AEs  is permitted 
(see Section 9.8) but may result in discontinuation from study based on consultation 
between the Investigator and the Medical Monitor.  
Medroxyprogesterone or megestrol acetate may be given to subjec ts without breast cancer as an 
appetite stimulant and bisphosphonates or denosumab may be administered to subjects with bone metastases if started 60 days before study entry. 
As ALKS 4230 is a protein, there are no anticipated metabolic drug- drug interacti ons. 
8.4.3.1. Premed ication 
Antipyretics are required throughout the ALKS 4230 treatment period. To reduce the potential 
for infusion- related fever or chills, premedication with an antipyretic agent ( nonsteroidal 
anti-inflammatory drugs and acetaminophen) is requir ed at least 15 minutes prior to ALKS  4230 
administration and should continue for at least 12 hours after the last dose of ALKS 4230 unless 
the Investigator has a rationale to withhold it from the subject. 
8.5. Definition of End of the Study  
A subject will have fulfilled the requirements for study completion if/when the subject has 
completed all study periods, including the Safety Follow-up Period and Follow -up Assessments 
or the last scheduled visit as indicated in the Schedule of As sessments ( Table 5, Table 6, Table 7, 
and Table 8).  
The end of the study will be the last subject’s last visit (if applicab le, the last phone call with the 
Investigator during the Safety Follow-up Period and Follow- up Assessments) as indicat ed in the 
Schedule of Assessments ( Table 5, Table 6, Table 7, and Table 8).  
8.6. Protocol Deviations 
Should a protocol deviation occur, the Sponsor must be informed as soon as possible.  Protocol 
deviations and/or violations and the reasons they occurred will be included in the clinical study 
report. Reporting of protocol deviations to the Institutional Review Board (IRB) or independent 
ethics committee and in accordance with applicable Regulatory Authority mandates is an Investigator resp onsibility.

Page 73 9. TREATMENT OF SUBJECTS  
9.1. Study Drug Dose and Administration  
9.1.1. ALKS 4230 Dosing and Administration 
ALKS  4230 will be administered IV as a 30-minute infusion through a 0.22 µm in- line filter for 
5 consecutive days, followed by a period off treatment i n repeating cycles. During Cycle 1 of 
Parts A and B, the period off treatment will be 9 days, resulting in a cycle length of 14 days 
(2 weeks). Cycle 2 and subsequent cycles will have a period off treatment of 16 days, resulting in 
a cycle length of 21 day s (3 weeks) for each cycle. Infusion for each dosing day of each cycle 
should begin within 3 hours (plus or minus) of the infusion start time for Day 1 of that cycle. Emergency resuscitation equipment should be available. For the first 2 treatment cycles of Part A, ALKS  4230 will be administered inpatient in a medical facility with access to medical 
support measures and to the intensive care unit, if needed. Subjects may be discharged on Day 6 of each of the first 2  treatment cycles if medically stable. In the absence of DLTs, subsequent 
treatment cycles may be administered on an outpatient basis. For Part B and Part C of the study, administration of ALKS 4230 may be done in an outpatient setting  
In Part C,  on days where ALKS 4230 is administered in combina tion with pembrolizumab , 
ALKS 4230 should be administered as an infusion 60 (±30) minutes after the completio n of 
pembrolizumab infusion. For Part C, a subject’s ALKS 4230 dose may be reduced by one dose 
level as needed at the discretion of the Investigato r. Study drug dose adjustments for all subjects 
are described in Section  9.6. 
Sites should make every effort to target infusion timing to be as close to 30 minutes as possible. However, given the variability of infusion pumps from site to site, a window betw een -5 minutes 
and +10 minutes is permitted (ie, infusion time is 30 minutes [ -5 minutes/+10 minutes]). 
ALKS 4230 may be infused using peripheral or central venous access per local standards of care and the tre ating Investigator’s judgment. All subjects should have adequate intravenous access to 
allow the immediate management of toxicities. Subjects who do not have adequate peripheral venous access should have a central venous access device placed per local standards of care.  
Amount of drug administered is based on subjects’ body weight as measured at Day 1 (-72 hours) of each cycle. 
Sites must have written procedures in place detailing the healthcare personnel required to be on 
site during subject dosing, the availa bility of equipment and medications necess ary to treat an 
emergency (should it occur) and the process for transferring a subject to a medical facility if necessary.  
9.1.2. Pembrolizumab Dosing and Administration  
Pembrolizumab is to be administered as an IV in fusion over 30 minutes in a dose of 200 mg 
every 3  weeks, for up to 2 years as long as subjects are deriving clinical benefit (ie, objective 
response or SD), in accordance with the prescribing information ( Keytruda [pembroli zumab] 
USPI ). Subjects will be monitored for at least 1  hour for potential acute reactions to 
pembrolizumab prior to administration of ALKS 4230, as described in Section  9.1.1. 
 Alkermes, Inc.  
Protocol ALK4230-A101 v 13.0 CONFIDENTIAL  
Page 74 Sites should make every effort to tar get infusion timing to be as close to 30 minutes as possible. 
However, given the variability of infusion pumps from site to site, a window between -5 minutes 
and +10 minutes is permitted (ie, infusion time is 30 minutes  [-5 minutes/+10 minutes]). 
Pembr olizumab is to be obtained from the study sites’ pharmacies, from commercial supplies or 
provided by Sponsor in countries where pembrolizumab is not yet approved.  
 
9.2. Infusion-Related Reactions  
ALKS 4230 may be associated with infusion-related reactions, including pyrexia, tachycardia, 
and chills with onset 3-6 hours postinfusion. Infusion- related reactions should be treated at the 
discreti on of the Investigator.  
 
Refer to Section  8.4.3.1 for guidance around medications used for pretre atment.  
Infusion-related reactions associated with the use of pembrolizumab should be managed in 
accordance with the prescribing information for pembrolizumab ( Keytruda [pembrolizumab] 
USPI ). 
9.3. Treatment Adherence  
ALKS 4230 and pembrolizumab will be administered at a medical facility or study center by 
study staff; ther efore, compliance is ensured. The clinical research associates will confirm study 
drug was administered and documented in subject’s eCRFs during site visits. 
9.4. Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment  
Randomization is not planned for this open-label study. 
9.5. Blinding  
Not applicable for this open-label study. 
9.6. Study Drug Dose Adjustments and Stopping Rules  
9.6.1. Adverse Events Observed After Dose- Limiting Toxicity Observation Period  
Subjects who are part of the first dose cohort who experience an event that meets the defi nition 
of a DLT during Cycle 1 or Cycle 2 will be removed from the study. Beyond C2D15, if a subject 
experiences a DLT, a dose reduction of one level ( Table 1) may be allowed and treatment 
continued at this reduced dose for all subsequent cycles. If a subject has another DLT at the 
reduced level, another dose reduction may be allowed if, in the Investigator’s opinion, 
benefit -risk assessment warrants continuing ALKS 4230. The Investigator should consult with 
the Medi cal Monitor for approval to continue to treat at reduced dose. A subject who experiences 
a third DLT after 2 dose reductions should be discontinued from study treatment.

9.6.3. Intrapatient Dose Escalation 
Under the circumstances described below, an individual subject may be per mitted to have his/her 
dose escalated (ie, intrapatient dose escalation) upon th e mutual agreement of the Investigator 
and the Medical Monitor. Such escalations would increase the subject’s dose to the 
protocol-defined dose level that is one level higher than the subject’s current dose level. For such escalation to be considered for a subject, the following criteria must be met: 
• The subject must have tolerated his/her current dose level without experiencing a DLT;  
• The higher dose level being considered for the subject must have had its cohort 
enrolled and determined by the SRC to not e xceed the MTD and;  
• The Investigator must believe that the dose escalation is in the best interest of the subject.  
A subject may have more than one dose escalation. The above cr iteria must be met for each 
escalation.  
For subjects in Part C Cohorts C1, C2, C3, or C4, intrapatient dose escalation may be considered for subjects who had been assigned to the 1 μg/kg/day dose level or the 3 μg/kg/day dose level 
and adequately tolerated  combination therapy. Escalation to a dose of 6 μg/kg/day or above may 
be considered after the SRC has determined the dose level to be adequately tolerated.

Protocol ALK4230-A101 v 13.0 CONFIDENTIAL  
Page 82 11. ASSESSMENT OF ANTITUMOR ACTIVITY  
Tumor Assessments  
Antitumor activity will be determined by the measurement of extent of known disease at baseline 
and approximately every 5 to 6 weeks, following each even- numbered treatment cycle. 
Appropriate radiological procedures (computed tomography scanning, magnetic resonance 
imaging, radionuclide imaging) should be conducted to evaluate areas of disease. Superficial 
skin tumors will be measured with calipers and photographed for evaluation. It is requested that the initial method of meas urement be mai ntained throughout the course of the study. The 
determination of response will be conducted according to the standard RECIST and iRECIST criteria for Parts A, B, and C.  
Refer to the guidelines for RECIST, tumors are assessed as CR, PR, SD, o r PD.  
Refer t o the guidelines for iRECIST, tumor s are assessed as immune CR (iCR), immune PR 
(iPR), immune SD (iSD), or immune PD (iPD).  
For purposes of this study, subjects must meet the definition for SD/iSD for a minimum of 12 weeks before this assessment can be determined. 
In studies with immunothe rapeutic agents, CR, PR, or SD have been shown to occur after an increase 
in tumor burden characterized as PD by RECIST criteria. The conventional response criteria such as 
RECIST may not adequately assess the activity of  immunotherapeutic agents. PD evalu ated 
radiologically may not mean therapeutic failure, as responses to immune therapies may occur after 
conventional PD. The appearance of measureable antitumor activity may take longer for  immune 
therapies than for cytotoxic therapies. With immunotherapeut ic agents, there should be allowance for 
clinically insignificant PD, defined as small new lesions in the presence of other responsive lesions, which may occur even though the subject is responding to the immunotherapy. S table disease may 
also represent an titumor activity with iRECIST. Therefore, RECIST and iRECIST will be used to 
ensure a more comprehensive evaluation of tumor response for ALKS 4230.  
The ORR/iORR is the number of subjects exhibiting a CR/iCR or PR or iPR divided by the 
number of subjects evaluable for antitumor activity. Duration of response will also be 
determined. The ORR/iORR will be calculated separately for subjects in the dose -escalation 
portion of the study (Part A), in the dose-expansion part of the study (Part B), and in the 
combination therapy part of the study (Part C). Tumor images will be collected and stored 
centrally. Centralized readings may be used to assess scans beginning in the second stage (N2) of Part B  cohorts and Part C C5, C6, and C7 cohorts.

PHARMACODYNAMICS, AND IMMUNOGENICITY  
12.1. Pharmacokinetics  
Serum samples for evaluation of ALKS 4230 PK will be obtained from each subject at 
predetermined time points. A valid ated electrochemiluminescence metho d using the Meso Scale 
Discovery platform will be used for the quantitation of ALKS 4230 in human serum. 
Noncompartmental PK analysis will be performed to estimate the PK parameters for 
ALKS  4230. 
Remaining serum PK samples obtained during scheduled PK blood draws in Part C, as noted in Table 7, may be analyzed for pembrolizumab concentrati ons at a future date.  
12.2. Immunogenicity 
Serum samples for evaluation of anti-ALKS 4230 antibody induction will be obtained from each subject at predetermined time points. A validated electrochemiluminescence method using the 
Meso Scale Discovery platform will  be used for the detection of antidrug antibodies to 
ALKS  4230 in human serum. The assessment of immune-response induction for each study 
subject will be based on the comparison of the predose and postdose sample results. 
12.3. Pharmacodynamics and Biomarkers  
The pharmacodynamic response of various biomarkers will be assessed in blood and serum 
samples co llected from all subjects in the study. Additional biomarker analyses may be 
performed on tumor tissue samples, which are optional for study subjects. 
12.3.1. Blood-Base d Biomarkers  
The pharmacodynamic effect of ALKS 4230 is assessed by measuring circulating CD8 + T cells, 
Tregs, and NK cells in peripheral blood by flow cytometry from each subject at predetermined 
time points.  
In addition, serum samples will be obtained from each subject at predetermined time points. 
Concentration of multiple proinflammatory cytokines including interferon-γ, tumor necrosis factor -α, IL -1β, IL-6, and IL-10 will be determined.  
Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) will also be measured at predetermined time points. 
12.3.2. Tumor Tissue Biomarkers  
12.3.2.1. Tumor Biopsies  
Collection of fresh tumor samples via biopsy is optional during the study. Subjects with 
accessible tumors who are willing to undergo biopsy should provide samples at baseline and 
while on treatment around C2D8. A punch biopsy is preferred for tissue collection from 
melanoma subjects.  
These samples will be analyzed by immunohistochemistry and/or immunofluorescence for markers of immune activation. They can also be used for gene expression analysis usi ng method 
 Alkermes, Inc.  
Protocol ALK4230-A101 v 13.0 CONFIDENTIAL  
Page 85 such as NanoString. Comparison of on- treatment versus baseline results can be used to  
demonstrate the pharmacologic impact to tumor microenvironment. The analysis of the baseline 
tumor tissues will be used for correlative analysis. Refer to the Laboratory Manual for tumor sample handling and processing information.
 
12.3.2.2. Archived Tumor  
Subjects enrolled in the dose-expansion monotherapy part (Part B) or combination therapy part 
(Part C) of the study must agree to provide archival tumor tissue biopsy sam ple(s), if available. 
The archival tumor tissue sample does not have to be obtained prior to enrollment into the study, 
however every effort should be made to submit the archived tissue within 30 days of study 
enrollment. For subjects who have av ailable samples of formalin -fixed, paraffin -embedded 
tumor tissue, 15 unstained glass slides of tissue sections will be provided, to be analyzed. These 
samples will be analyzed by immunohistochemistry and/or immunofluorescence for markers of 
immune activation. They can also be used for gene expression analysis using method such as NanoString. Comparison of on- treatment versus baseline results can be used to demonstrate the 
pharmacologic impact to tumor microenvironment. The analysis of the baseline tumor ti ssues 
will be used for correlative analysis. Refer to the Laboratory Manual for tumor sample handling and processing information.

Page 86 13. ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY  
Safety will be assessed on the basis of:  
• Reporting of AEs 
• Collection of vital signs (ie, systolic and dia stolic blo od pressure, pulse, respiratory 
rate, and body temperature) and weight 
• Clinical laboratory parameters (ie, hematology, chemistry, and urinalysis; see 
Section  8.3.10) 
• ECG parameters (overall assessment; heart rate; RR, PR, QRS, and QTc intervals) 
13.1. Definition of Adverse Event  
An AE is any untoward medical occ urrence in a subject or clinical investigation subject 
administered a pharmaceutical pr oduct. The occurrence, which may or may not have a causal 
relationship with the investigational treatment, may include any clinical or laboratory change that does not commonly occur in that subject and is considered clinically significant. Thus, an AE 
can be any unintended and unfavorable physical sign, laboratory parameter, or symptom that 
develops or worsens in severity during the course of this study, or significant worsening of the 
disease under study or of any concurrent disease, regardless of relationship to investigational treatment.  
Illnesses present before the subject si gning the informed consent form (ICF) are considered to be 
preexisting conditions and are documented on the medical history eCRF. Any new or preexisting 
conditions that worsen during the study are entered on the AE eCRF. Disease progression is not 
considered as an AE or SAE. Death resulting from disease progression should not be reported as an SAE.  
All out-of- range laboratory values will be deemed as clinically significant or not clinically 
significant by the Investigator, and may or may not be an AE. An abnormal lab value may be considered an AE under the following conditions: 
• It is clinically significant  
• It is an SAE (eg, it requires hospitalization)  
• It requires medical intervention  
• It requires a change or delay in the administration of study drug or permanent discontinuation of study drug 
Clinically significant values will be considered AEs and recorded as such on the eCRFs. 
Laboratory values that do not meet one of the above criteria are not required to be reported as 
AEs.  
Pregnancy is not considered an AE, although a subject will be withdrawn from the study if a 
pregnancy occurs. As described in S ection  8.4.2, the pregnancy must be reported to Alkermes 
and additional follow-up may be required. 
 Alkermes, Inc.  
Protocol ALK4230-A101 v 13.0 CONFIDENTIAL  
Page 87 13.2. Definition of Seri ous Adverse Event  
An SAE is any AE, occurring at any dose and regardless of causality that: 
• Results in death  
• Is life-threatening. The subject is at immediate risk of death from the reaction as it 
occurs. This does not include reaction that, had it occurred in a more severe form, 
might have caused death.  
• Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization.  
• Results in persistent and significant disability/incapacity (eg, a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct norm al life functions)  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect 
Important medical events that may not result in death, be immediately life -threatening, or require 
hospitalization may be considered to be SAEs when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject or subject and may require intervention to prevent one of the other outc omes listed above.  
Admission to a hospital or an inpatient unit for a nonmedical reason (ie, social stay admission) during the study in the absence of untoward m edical occurrence will not be considered as an 
SAE, but will be reported as an AE. 
Hospitalization due to worsening of behavioral health related issues should be reported as an 
SAE.  
13.3. Relationship to Study Drug  
The assessment of study drug relationship to each AE will be reported on the appropriate source document (and SAE form, in the event of an SAE) by the Investigator (or designated subinvestigator) according to his/her best clinical judgment. The criteria listed in Table 14 should 
be used to guide this assessment. Please note that not all criteria must be p resent to be indicative 
of a particular drug relationship. All study drugs are considered “test drugs” for the purposes of 
the definitions listed in the table.  
For subjects participating in Part C of the study, AE causality relationships will be attribute d to 
both pembrolizumab and ALKS 4230 unless it is explicitly stated otherwise by the Investigator (eg, if the AE occurs immediately after pembrolizumab is admin istered and prior to ALKS 4230 
administr ation).

Adverse event data collection wil l begin after a subject signs the ICF and will continue until 
30 days after the final dose of study drug. Any SAE that the Investigator attributes to study drug 
with onset any time after the 30 -day period must be reported. Subjects with ongoing AEs will be 
followed by the Investigator until the AE has resolved or returned to the baseline level. 
The Investigator, Medical Monitor, and Sponsor will review the collect ed da ta regularly for 
evidence of AEs. All subjects will be assessed routinely for AEs as outlined in the study 
schedule. All AEs observed will be graded using NCI CTCAE version 4.03 or higher. Refer to 
the NCI CTCAE website for descriptions of Grades 1 through 5 for AEs.  
Subjects will be instructed by the Investigator or designee to report the occurrence of any AE. All volunteered, elicited, and observed AEs are to be recorded on the AE eCRFs.

Page 89 The Investigator will assess all AEs regarding any causal relat ionship to the study drug (see 
Section  13.3), the intensity (severity) of the event, action taken, and subject outcome. Refer to 
the NCI CTCAE website fo r descriptions of AE severities. 
All AEs will be followed u ntil resolution, until deemed stable by the Investigator, or until the 
subject is deemed by the Investigator to be lost to follow-up. 
For clinical study safety reporting purposes, the most recent version of the Investigator’s 
Brochure will be used as the r eference document to designate event expectedness. For AEs 
associated with pembrolizumab, the prescribing information for pembrolizumab should be used as the reference document to designate event expectedness ( Keytruda [pembrolizumab] USPI ). 
Withdrawal from the study as a result of an AE and any therapeutic measures that are taken shall 
be at the discretion of the Investigator. If a subject withdraws from the study for any reason, any 
ongoing AEs will be followed until resolution, until deemed stable by the Investigator, or until 
the subject is deemed by the Investigator to be lost to follow-up.

14.1. Determination of Sample Size  
The number of subjects planned to be enrolled in this study is expected to be approximately 
140 to 327. This is based on an assumption of approximately 36 to 54 subjects to be enrolled in 
Part A, 42 to 82 subjects to be enrolled in Part B, an d up to 191 subjects to be enrolled in Part C 
(Table 15).  
Table 15: Number of Subjects Expected in Each Study P eriod  
Study Peri od Number of Subjects  
Part A  N=36 -54 (assuming 6 or 7 dose levels)  
Part B  N=42 -82 
Part C new subjects  N=Up to 191 
Part C rollover subjects  Not applicable  
Part C safety run -in subjects treated 
at 1 μg/kg/day dose level N=3-6 
Total number of subjects exposed to 
ALKS  4230 N=140-327 
Note: Part C rollover subjects do not contribute the total number of subjects exposed to ALKS  4230.  
In Part A of the study, the number of subjects per dose level is illustrated in Table 1. The number 
of subjects to be enrolled in Part A will depend upon the number of dose escalations, which in 
turn will depend upon the safety profile of ALKS 4230. If 6 or 7 dose levels are enrolled, then 
the number of subjects participating in Part A is expected to be approximately 36 to 54. 
Part B is designed to enroll subjects in each of 2 cohorts based on tumor type and prior therapy. 
The sample size of each cohort was chosen based on methodology described by Simon regarding optimal 2-stage designs for Phase 2 studies ( Simon 1989). The intention in this study is to enroll 
cohorts that correspond to the first stage of such a design. The assumed alpha is 0.05 and power is 90%. Enrollment to these cohorts will follow a PR (unconfirmed) Simon’s two-stage design enrollment as outlined below. Response assessments will be based on the RECIST and iRECIST guidelines.

optim al 2-stage designs for Phase 2 studies ( Simon 1989). The intention in this study is to enroll 
cohorts that correspond to the first stage of such a design. The assumed alpha is 0.15 and power 
is 85%. Any of the following Part C coh orts may be stopped early if inadequate activity is 
observed: 
• PD-1/L1 unapproved tumor types cohort (zero responses in the first 15 subjects) 
• PD-1/L1 approved tumor types (PD -1/L1 pretreated) cohort (zero responses in the 
first 15  subjects)  
• PD-1/L1 approved tumor types (PD-1/L1 treatment naive) cohort (≤3 objective 
responses in the first 20 subjects)  
The Part C rollover cohort (Cohort 4) is designed to provide access to ALKS 4230 in combination with pembrolizumab for subjects initially enrolled into stu dy Part A and Part B. It is 
estimated that between 0 and 54 subjects may potentially enter this cohort. Participation in the rollover cohort does not contribute to the overall number of subjects exposed to ALKS 4230. The rollover cohort will close to enrol lmen t if the other Part C cohorts have closed early due to 
insufficient antitumor activity.

14.3.3. Antitumor Evaluable Population  
The antitumor evaluable population will consist of subjects who complete 2 cycles of therapy and have at least one follow-up scan.  
14.4. Statistical Analysis  
14.4.1. Subject Disposition, Baseline D emographi cs, and Treatment Characteristics  
14.4.1.1. Subject Disposition

14.4.2. Antitumor Activity Analyses 
Antitumor activity analyses will be based on  the anti tumor population. 
14.4.2.1. Overall Response Rate  
The evaluation of ORR will be based on Investigator review of the radiographic or photographic images, as defined according to RECIST 1.1. In addition, central review may be assessed for 
select cohorts (N2 o f Part B cohorts and N2 of Part C C5, C6, and C7 cohorts). Overall response 
 Alkermes, Inc.  
Protocol ALK4230-A101 v 13.0 CONFIDENTIAL  
Page 93 rate is defined as t he proportion of subjects with objective evidence of CR or PR among the 
number of subjects evaluable for antitumor activity. 
At the analysis stage, the best ORR  will be assigned for each subject as the best response 
recorded after initiation of study treatment, taking into account any requirement for confirmation. 
If applicable, responses recorded after disease progression or initiation of new anticancer 
treatmen t will be  excluded. 
The ORR will be calculated separately for those subjects in the dose- escalat ion portion of the 
study (Part A), in the dose-expansion portion of the study (Part B), and in the combination therapy part of the study (Part C). 
Summarization  of ORR w ill be presented by frequency, percentage, and 95% confidence interval 
(CI). The CI wil l be obtained using an exact approach given the small sample size. 
Sum of the Diameters of all lesions reported at each visit will be graphed by spider plot 
(% change over  time) and waterfall plot (best % change). The swimmer plot will be used to 
display t he characteristics of the responses in subjects.  
14.4.2.2. Immune Overall Response Rate  
The Investigator is asked to consult Seymour et  al 2017 for full description of iRECIST . iRECIST 
is based on RECIST 1.1. Responses assigned using iRECIST have a prefix of “i” (ie, immune) to 
differentiate them from responses assigned using RECIST 1.1. The principles used to establish 
objective tumor response are l argely unchanged from RECIST 1.1, but the major change for 
iRECIST is the concept of resetting the bar if RECIST 1.1 progression is followed at the next assessment by tumor shrinkage.  
iRECIST defines iUPD (immune unconfirmed progressive disease) on the ba sis of RECIST 1.1 
principles. If the criteria for iUPD have never been met, principles follow RECIST 1.1. 
However, if the criteria for iUPD have been met, the next timepoint response could be iUPD, 
iSD, iPR, or iCR, or iCPD (immune confirmed progressive di sease). 
For iRECIST, the best overall response (iBOR) is the best timepoint response recorded from the 
start of the study treatment until the end of the study treatment, taking into account any 
requirement for confirmation. Immune overall response rate wil l be bas ed on iBOR.  
The iBOR will be calculated separately for those subjects in the d ose-escalation portion of the 
study (Part A), in the dose-expansion portion of the study (Part B), and in the combination therapy part of the study (Part C). A spider plot , waterfall plot, and swimmer plot will be used to 
display the characteristics of the  responses in subjects. 
14.4.2.3. Disease Control Rate 
Disease control rate is defined as the proportion of subjects with objective evidence of CR, PR, or SD at Cycle 4 or later.  
The DCR  will be calculated separately for those subjects in the dose- escalation portio n of the 
study (Part A), in the dose-expansion portion of the study (Part B), and in the combination therapy part of the study (Part C).

14.4.2.4. Immune Disease Control Rate  
Immune disease control rate is defined as the proportion of subjects with objective evidence of 
iCR, iPR, or iSD a t Cycle 4 or later.  
The iDCR will be calculated separately for those subjects in the dose-escalation portion of the 
study (Part A), in the dose-expansion portion of the study (Part B), and in the combination therapy part of the study (Part C). 
Summarizati on of iDCR will be presented by frequency, percentage, and 95% CI. The CI will be 
obtained using an exact approach given the small sample size. 
14.4.2.5. Duration of Response (Part B and Part C) 
Duration of response, defined as the time from the first documentation of response (CR or PR) to 
the first documentation of objective tumor progression or death due to any cause. Subjects who 
are alive and progression free as of the analysis cut -off date will be censored at their last 
evaluable tumor response assessment befor e initiation of any new anticancer treatment. Subjects 
with two or more consecutive missing response assessments prior to death or a visit with documented progression will be censored at the last date of tumor assessment when the subject was documented to be progression free. Subjects who never achieve CR or PR prior to starting any new anticancer treatment at a lesion site will be excluded from the analysis.  
The rate of response will be calculated for RECIST responders.  
For Part B, the DOR will be calculat ed as follows (in weeks): 
(date of PD/death in Part B – date of first response (CR or PR) in Part B + 1)/7  
For Part C, the DOR will be calculated as follows (in weeks):  
(date of PD/death in Part C – date of first response (CR or PR) in Part C + 1)/ 7 
The distribution of DOR will be estimated for Part B and Part C using Kaplan- Meier 
methodology. The median point estimate DOR will be provided along with the two-sided 95% 
CIs based on the antitumor evaluable population with subjects who experienced CR or PR. 
Kaplan-Meier curves will be provided. 
14.4.2.6. Immune Duration of Response (Part B and Par t C) 
Immune duration of response, defined as the time from the first documentation of response (iCR or iPR) to the first documentation of objective tumor progression or de ath due to any cause. 
Subjects who are alive and progression free as of the analysis cut -off date will be censored at 
their last evaluable tumor response assessment before initiation of any new anticancer treatment. Subjects with two or more consecutive missing response assessments prior to death or a visit 
with documented progression will be censored at the last date of tumor assessment when the

14.4.2.7. Durable Response Rate (Part B and  Part C)  
Durable response rate is defined as the percentage of subjects with an objective response 
(complete or partial response per RECIST1.1) lasting continuously for 6 months and starting any 
time within 12 months of initiating the study drug. T he DRR w ill be summarized by each tumor 
type. Summary of DRR will be presented by frequency, pe rcentage, and 95% CI. The CI will be 
obtained using an exact approach given the small sample size.  
Immune durable response rate (iDRR) is defined as the percentage of s ubjects with an objective 
response (complete or partial response per iRECIST) lasting continuously for 6 months and 
starting any time within 12 months of initiating the study drug. The iDRR will be summarized by 
each tumor type. Summary of iDRR will be pre sented by frequency, percentage, and 95% CI.

14.4.2.8. Progression -free Survival (Part B and Part C)  
Progression-free survival, defined as the time from the first dose of ALKS 4230 to the f irst 
documentation of objective tumor progression or death due to any cause. Subjects who do not have disease progression or have not died will be censored at the last known time that the subject 
was progression free. If a subject begins a new anti cancer t reatment (either systemic or local) 
prior to documented progression or death, or a subject is removed from the study due to 
undocumented clinical disease progression, then the subject will be censored at the last 
assessment where the subject was documented  as progression free prior to the intervention. 
Subjects with two or more consecutive missing response assessments prior to a visit with 
documented progression (or death) will be censored at the last date of tumor assessment when the subject was documented  to be progression free.  
For Part B, the PFS will be calculated as follows (in weeks):  
(date of PD/death in Part B – first dose date in Part B + 1)/7  
For Part C, the PFS will be calculated as follows (in weeks):  
(date of PD/death in Part C– first dose dat e in Part C + 1)/7  
The survival distribution of PFS will be estimated using Kaplan- Meie r methodology. The 
median PFS will be provided along with the two-sided 95% CIs based on the antitumor evaluable population. In addition, Kaplan- Meier curves wil l be provided. The 6-month and

The Investigator is responsible for submitting all protocol changes and SAE reports to the IRB 
according to local procedures. At a minimum, all SAEs requiring an investigational new drug safety report must be immediately reported. 
All relevant correspondence from the IRB will be forwarded by the respective study center to the Sponsor in a timely fashion. 
17.2. Ethical Conduct of the Study  
This study will be conducted in accordance with the protocol, the ICH Guideline E6, and all  
applicable local regulatory requirements. GCP is an international ethical and scientific  quality 
standard used for designing, conducting, recording, and reporting studies involving the participation of human subjects. Alkermes is committed to comp lying with this standard to 
provide assurance that the rights, safety, and well-being of study subjects will be protected, consistent with the principles having their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. 
17.3. Written Informed Consent  
The Investigator (or auth orized designee) at each center will ensure that the subject (or the 
subject’s legal representati ve) is given full and adequate oral and written information about the 
nature, purpose, and potential and possible risks and benefits of the study. Each prospec tive 
subject will receive an IRB -approved ICF that summarizes the pertinent study information and 
will be given ample time to read the form and ask questions about the study. All information is to 
be provided in a language understandable to the subject and must not include any language that 
waives the subject’s legal rights. Prospective subjects must also be informed of their right to withdraw consent without prejudice at any time during the study. If the subject chooses to 
participate, he or she must sign and date the ICF before any study- specific procedures are 
conducted. 
All subjects will be informe d of their rights to privacy and will be made aware that the study data 
will be submitted to Alkermes, the IRB, the contract research organization if applicable, and to 
regulatory authorities for review and evaluation for the duration of the study and unti l the project 
has been approved for marketing, or is withdrawn from investigation. They will also be informed 
that the study monitor may inspect their medical records to verify the accuracy and completeness 
of the study records and results. 
Significant changes to the protocol or product safety information may require a revision of the 
ICF, which must be reviewed and approved by the IRB, and then signed by all applicable  study 
participants.

An overview of study data handling and record-keeping procedures and restrictions is provided 
in the subsequent sections; please refer to the CSA for further details. 
18.1. Data Capture  
As stated in Section  16.1, this study will use eCRFs for capturing data. All entries, corrections, 
and alterations will be made by the Investigator or other authorized study personnel. All data entries will be verified for accuracy and correctness by independent monitors. The electronic data capture system  maintains a full audit trail.  
A copy of all images (computed tomography scan, magnetic resonance imaging scan, or photographs) will be stored with the source documents at the study site. 
A copy of all laboratory reports w ill rema in with the source documents at the study center. All 
out-of- range laboratory values will be deemed as clinically significant or not clinically 
significant by the Investigator. Clinically significant values will be considered AEs and recorded 
as su ch on the eCRFs.  
Adverse events wi ll be coded using Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities. Concomitant 
medications will be categorized using the World Health Organization Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical classification system.  
18.2. Inspection of Records  
Alkermes or its representative will be allowed to conduct site visits to the investigational 
facilities for the purpose of monitoring any aspect of the study. The Investigator agrees to allow 
the monitor to inspect the drug storage area, study drug stocks, drug accountability records, 
subject charts and source documents, and other records relative to study conduct. 
18.3. Retention of Records  
Retention and storage of essential clinical study documents (eg, worksheets, drug accountability forms, and other administrative documentation) shall be governed by the terms and conditions of the site’s CSA and in accordance with ICH guidelines/local regulatory requirements as follows: 
Essential documents should be retained until at least 2 years after the last approval of a 
marketing  application in an ICH region and until there are no pending or contemplated marketing 
applications in an ICH region, or at least 2 years have elapsed since the formal discontinuation of clinical development of the investigational product. These documents should be retained for a 
longer period, however, if required by the applicable regulatory requirements or by the terms of 
the CSA. It is the responsibility of the Sponsor to inform the Investigator/institution as to when 
these documents no longer need to be retained.  
Subjects’ medi cal files should be retained in accordance with the applicable legislation and in 
accordance with the maximum period of time permitted by the hospital, institution, or private practice.

Version 1. 1 (Date: 22 January 201 5) PRÉCIS  
 
Objectives : Determine the feasibility and acceptability of a combined treatment for veterans  with 
comorbid chronic pain and opioid misuse or dependence, as well as assess mechanisms of change 
during the combined intervention.  A secondary objective is to examine weekly progress on specific 
therapy targets (e.g., pain acceptance, self -compassion, opioid craving) in the interventions in order to 
identify potential mechanisms of change and to identify the choice of intermediate endpoints for a larger 
randomized clinical trial. Approach —To test the feasibility of recruitment and retention, as well as study 
weekly progress on treatment targets, within a randomized clinical trial (RCT) of Acceptance and 
Commitment Therapy (ACT) + Mindfulness -Based Relapse Prevention  (MBRP) or treatment as usual for 
chronic pain and opiate misuse.   
 
Design and Outcomes: Veterans with chronic pain and opiate misuse, abuse, or dependence who are 
receiving long -term opioid therapy (i.e., 90+ days) will be recruited from the Raymond G Murphy 
Veterans Affairs (VA) Medical Center in Albuquerque, NM.  Treatment will begin in Year 1 and conclude 
in Year 2 with follow -up assessment lasting through the first quarter of Year 3.  At the time of enrolling in 
the trial, individuals will participate in a baseline assessment including self -report and behavioral 
measures.  Participants ( n = 120) will then be randomized to one of two treatment conditions: (1) 
treatment services -as-usual (i.e., standard care) or (2) standard care with eight weeks of group ACT plus 
four weeks of group MBRP.  Participants will complete assessments at baseline (entry into the study), 
weekly during the first three months of the study (during treatment), three months after entry in the study 
(end of treatment), and nine months after entry in the study (six months after treatment conclusion).   
 
Self-Report and Behavioral Assessment Batteries —Self-report and behavioral assessments will be used 
to evaluate study hypotheses.  For the follow -up assessments we will use contact information collected 
at baseline to contact participants by phone one week prior to their scheduled follow -up date.  
Participants will be reminded about procedures and scheduled to complete all assessments at the VA .  
 
Demographic Information ( Pre-treatment, Post -treatment, and 6 month follow -up assessment) : Patient 
demographics ( e.g., gender, age, educational achievement) and pain -related information (e.g., 
duration, location, history of treatment) will be collected during the pre -treatment assessment. We will 
re-assess pain -related information and treatment history at post -treatment and the 6 -month follow -up 
assessment.  
 
Clinical Outcome Measures ( Pre-treatment, Post -treatment, and 6 month follow -up assessment) :  
Given the relevance of interference from pain on key aspects of functioning in those with chronic pain, 
we will utilize the NIH PROMIS toolkit measures for pain behavior1 and pain interference2. Both 
PROMIS measures have evidence of excellent psychometric properties in chronic pain. We will also 
collect information on current opioid misuse using the Current Opioid Misuse Measure, a measure of 
aberrant opioid -related behaviors over the past month3. The recommended cut -score of 12 has 
adequate sensitivity (77%) and specificity (77%) for a current diagnosis of prescription drug abuse3. 
Finally, current pain intensity , as well as least, most, and average over the past seven days,  will be 
assessed via 0 -10 numerical ratings scales and disability will be assessed via the Sickness Impact 
Profile4. 
 
Weekly Self -Report Progress Measures (20 minutes per week) :  In order to examine our secondary 
objective concerning mechanisms of change during treatment, we will collect weekly data during the 12 
weeks of treatment to assess for change in specific therapy targets that are hypothesized to change 
during treatment.  These weekly progress measures will include three self-report questionnaires, each of 
which has evidence for mediating treatment outcomes in either ACT for chronic pain5 or MBRP for 
substance use disorder6,7.  These measures include : 
 
1. Chronic Pain Acceptance Questionnaire (CPAQ8).  The CPAQ is a 20 -item measure of acceptance 
and willingness to have chronic pain.  It is perhaps the most widely used measure of pain acceptance in 
 
A pilot study of integrated treatment for Veterans with chronic pain and opiate misuse   6 of 76 
 
Version 1. 1 (Date: 22 January 201 5) the literature and its  psychometric properties, factor structure, and sensitivity to treatment are well 
established9,10.   
 
2. Self-Compassion Scale (SCS11).  The SCS is a 26 -item questionnaire which evaluates numerous 
aspects of mindfulness and self -compassion.  Initial psychometric evaluations of the measure have 
provided support for its reliability and validity11.   
 
3. Penn Alcohol/Drug Craving Scale (PACS12).  A modified version of the PACS will be used to assess 
both alcohol and drug craving.  The PACS is a 5 -item measure including questions about frequency, 
intensity, and duration of craving, and an overall rating of craving for the previous week.  The PACS has 
demonstrated good psychometric properties in our prior studies, including internal consistency reliability 
(α=.87) and criterion validity6,7. 
 
In addition to these three questionnaires, the weekly progress measure will also include items to assess 
mindfulness practice (days/times per day) and homework assignment completion , as well as items 
relating to pain intensity,  distress intensity, willingness to experience pain, and engagement in valued 
activity13. 
 
Interventions and Duration : Intervention Conditions —All participants will continue to receive standard 
care for chronic pain within the VA.  In addition, one -half of participants will be randomized to also 
receive ACT plus MBRP.  Standard Care :  Participants in a ll conditions will receive standard treatment as 
usual  at the VA , as indicated by the individual’s treatment plan which will not be manipulated by the 
research team.  Consistent with national and VA standards14,15, care at the recruitment sites typically 
consists of noninvasive interventions, such as analgesic pain medications (e.g., opioids, NSAIDs, anti -
epileptics), topical solutions (e.g., lidocaine), physical therapy, and massage, as well as limited invasive 
interventions (e.g., injections, radiofrequency denervation).   Acceptance and Commitment Therapy 
(Weeks 2 –9): The ACT intervention is based on the standardized and manualized protocol of Vowles and 
Sorrell16, which consists of weekly 90 -minute group meetings over eight weeks. The protocol has been 
successfully used in previous clinical trials (e.g., 17,18) and is currently available on the VA’s Evidence -
Based Practice SharePoint  website.  Over the course of the group meetings, participants will identify 
areas of meaningful functioning that have been adversely impacted by pain, learn methods to enhance 
pain willingness  in the service of these meaningful areas, and practice present -focused awareness skills.  
Group sessions will include discussions of the impact of pain and distress avoidance, identify ing 
alternative s to this avoidance  and establish  plans for behavior change, demonstration and role -playing 
exercises, and homework assignments.  Participants will be provided with a treatment manual to help 
guide and inform practice outside of group sessions. Table 1 provides an outline of session content for 
the eight week ACT intervention. We anticipate enrolling approximately  eight patients per group. 
Mindfulness Based Relapse Prevention (Weeks 10 –13):  The MBRP program is a standardized group 
psycho -educational intervention that consists of weekly 90 -minute group meetings spanning four19 to 
eight  weeks20.  For the current study, we will use the four -week program, which will eliminate 
redundancy with the ACT protocol (the eight -week MBRP group has some redundancy with ACT) and 
will also expand upon the 8 weeks of ACT by focusing on reactivity to substance cues, opioid  misuse, 
and nonjudgmental awareness.  Briefly, participants will be instructed in mindfulness techniques aimed at 
increasing concentration, improving awareness, and cultivating a nonjudgmental and accepting attitude 
toward craving and automatic thought patterns.  Group sessions include discussions of mindfulness as a 
means of coping with craving and painful cognitions, role -playing exercises, meditation practice, and 
homework assignments.  Each participant will be given audio CDs developed specifically for MBRP for 
independent practice outside of the group sessions.   
 
Sample Size and Population : This study will recruit veterans with chronic pain ( n = 120) who are 
currently misusing, abusing, or dependent on prescription opioids .  Participants will be recruited from the 
Co-Occurring Disorders Clinic (a specialty clinic for patients with chronic pain and evidence of 
problematic opioid use), as well as the Ambulatory Care and Primary Care Clinics of Raymond G. 
Murphy VA Medical Center in Albuquerque, New Mexico.

Version 1. 1 (Date: 22 January 201 5) 1. STUDY OBJECTIVES  
 
1.1 Primary Study Aims :  Determine the feasibility of an integrated psychosocial treatment 
(ACT + MBRP) in veterans with chronic pain with evidence of opioid -related problems. Chronic 
pain patients ( n = 120) who are receiving opioid therapy and who are identified as opioid misusing, 
abusing, or dependent will be recruited from the Albuquerque Veterans Administration (VA) Hospital.  
Participants will be randomized to receive standard care or standard care in addition to ACT+MBRP.  
Hypothesis 1: Feasibility of recruitment : Given the high prevalence of both chronic pain and opioid -
related problems in VA populations, we hypothesize it will be possible to recruit our target sample size ( n 
= 120) within a 15 -18 month timeframe.  
Hypothesis 2: Feasibility of retention : Drop -out rates will be consistent with other trials of similar 
psychosocial interventions for chronic pain (i.e., < 20%5,21–23). 
 
1.2 Secondary Study Aims : To examine weekly progress on specific therapy targets (e.g., pain 
acceptance, self-compassion , opioid craving) in the interventions in order to identify potential 
mechanisms of change and to identify the choice of intermediate endpoints for a larger 
randomized clinical trial.  
Hypothesis 1: Evidence of treatment mechanisms : The combined ACT+MBRP treatments will be 
associated with changes in treatment mechanisms specified within the therapeutic models and in a 
manner consistent with that of previous work on ACT and MBRP, in comparison with standard care.  
Hypothesis 2: Selection of intermediate endpoints : Weekly progress measures will  
provide data indicating  measures of treatment -specific mechanisms that are most sensitive to change.  
We hypothesize that acceptance of pain discomfort will be most sensitive to change in ACT and that 
reductions in reactivity to substance craving will be most sensitive to change in MBRP.  
  
2. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
 
2.1 Background on Condition, Disease, or Other Primary Study Focus  
 
Prescription drug abuse and opioid use disorders are a significant public health problem in the United 
States .  According to the most recent data from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health24, 
approximately 13% of the U.S. population (more than 34 million people) aged 12 or older reported 
lifetime nonmedical use of prescription pain relievers.  Likewise, in 2011, nearly two million Americans 
reported abuse or dependence on prescription pain relievers  within the past year .  Since 1999 , there has 
been a 300% increase in overdose deaths caused by prescription opioids , with 14,800 overdose deaths 
in 2008 alone .25 Overdose deaths due to opioids are more common than overdose deaths due to cocaine 
and heroin combined26.  The societal costs of prescription opioid misuse, abuse, and dependence was 
estimated at $55.7 billion in 2007, with workplace and healthcare costs accounting for 91% and criminal 
justice approximately 9% of those costs27.   
 
Substantial increases in morbidity and mortality associated with opioid misuse are particularly relevant in 
the case of chronic pain, a common healthcare concern in primary and specialist care settings28,29 
costing approximately $100 billion annually in the United States30,31.  The available evidence suggests 
opioids are increasingly used in the treatment of chronic pain32 with a recently published study indicating 
that 61% of 26,000 primary care patients surveyed were on long -term (i.e., 90+ consecutive days) 
chronic opioid therapy33.  Unfortunately, aberrant opioid use behaviors, such as opioid dependence and 
overuse or use of other substances, are quite common, occurring in up to 25% of patients on long -term 
opioid therapy34,35.  Furthermore, while comprehensive psychosocial treatments that address pain -related 
distress and disability have a strong evidence base36, patients meeting criteria for opioid dependence are 
at risk for poorer outcomes and noncompletion37.  Therefore, development of interventions that address 
the core issues of distress and disability as well as aberrant opioid use are a high priority.   
 
 
A pilot study of integrated treatment for Veterans with chronic pain and opiate misuse   8 of 76 
 
Version 1. 1 (Date: 22 January 201 5) In military veterans, the issues of chronic pain and opioid -related problems seem even more pronounced.  
Chronic pain is common, distressing, and debilitating, particularly in those that have served since the first 
Gulf War, with prevalence estimates reaching as high as 68%38–42.  As in civilian healthcare settings, 
opioids are commonly - and increasingly - used in the treatment of chronic pain in veterans38,43, with one 
recent large scale study indicating that two -thirds (978 of 1 ,478) of veterans with a chronic pain diagnosis 
were prescribed opioids as part of their treatment44.  Furthermore, in that same study, half of those 
prescribed opioids (478 of 978) were receiving in excess of 180 mg total daily morphine milligram 
equivalents , a level that represents a substantial increase in overdose risk in comparison with lower 
dosages45.  There is evidence of a vicious cycle of comorbidity amongst chronic pain, opioid abuse, and 
adverse events in veterans46,47.  For example, in one study of over 6 ,000 veterans, the mere presence of 
a chronic pain diagnosis almost doubled the risk of prescription drug abuse (OR: 1.9; 95% CI: 1.4 -2.5)48, 
while another large scale survey of over 15 ,000 veterans indicated a prescription for opioids for chronic 
pain was related with an increased risk of adverse clinical outcome (e.g., accidents resulting in wounds, 
opioid -related accidents, overdose, violence -related injuries) in a manner that was independent of mental 
health diagnoses or other prescribed medications43.  Clinicians in Veteran Affairs (VA) hospitals are well 
aware of these issues and have noted both frustration and uncertainty in treating chronic pain patients, 
as well as the lack of evidence -based approaches that simultaneously treat problems related to both 
chronic pain and opioid misuse49,50.   
 
2.2 Study Rationale  
 
In combination, the above data highlight the need for focused treatment development, especially in 
veterans who served in the recent conflicts, including Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF), Operation Enduring 
Freedom (OEF), and Operation New Dawn (OND).  T wo promising approaches are Acceptance and 
Commitment Therapy (ACT) for chronic pain and Mindfulness -Based Relapse Prevention (MBRP).  ACT 
for chronic pain decreases problematic pain avoidance behaviors and enhances engagement in effective 
and meaningful activities which contribute to fewer pain -related restrictions in functioning over the longer 
term51.  Mindfulness -Based Relapse Prevention (MBRP) for substance use disorders may be an ideal 
behavioral intervention for helping individuals cope with the desire, or “craving,” to use opioids , as well as 
the automatic tendency to use opioids when experiencing pain.  MBRP for substance use disorders was 
designed to target these behaviors, with the ultimate goal of reducing problematic substance use52,53.   
 
While there have been no direct examinations of ACT and MBRP in combination, research in ACT and 
MBRP separately presents a number of parallel, compatible findings which support their efficacy.  We 
therefore hypothesize that their combination in veterans experiencing chronic pain and opioid -related 
difficulties will be both appropriate and feasible.  Further, we hypothesize that the combination of these 
treatments will affect specific therapy targets (e.g., pain acceptance and opioid craving) in a manner 
consistent with existing trials.   
 
ACT and MBRP are each promising interventions with good efficacy data7,54 and are likely to 
complement one another in treating this population.  Thus, the proposed research is significant in that we 
are proposing to empirically test a combination of interventions that could greatly decrease pain 
interference, improve functioning, and decrease opioid misuse among the very large number of veterans 
treated for chronic pain.   
 
3. STUDY DESIGN  
 
As noted above, the primary objective of the study is to d etermine the feasibility and acceptability of a 
combined treatment for veterans with comorbid chronic pain and opioid misuse or dependence, as well 
as assess mechanisms of change during the combined intervention.  Participants will include v eterans 
with chronic pain and opiate misuse, abuse, or dependence who are receiving long -term opioid therapy 
(i.e., 90+ days) and who are receiving treatment from the Raymond G . Murphy Veterans Affairs (VA) 
Medical Center in Albuquerque, NM.  Treatment will begin in Year 1 and conclude in Year 2 with follow -

Version 1. 1 (Date: 22 January 201 5) up assessment lasting through the first quarter of Year 3.  At the time of enrolling in the trial, individuals 
will participate in a baseline assessment including self -report and behavioral measures. Participants ( n = 
120) will then be randomized to one of two treatment conditions: (1) treatment services -as-usual (i.e., 
standard care) or (2) standard care with eight weeks of group ACT plus four weeks of group MBRP.  
Participants will complete assessments at baseline (entry into the study), weekly during the first three 
months of the study (during treatment), three months after entry in the study (end of treatment), and nine 
months after entry in the study (six months after treatment conclusion).  The trial design is shown in 
Figure 1.   
 
Figure 1.  Proposed Trial Design  
Based on the preliminary data described above and our experience in working with chronic pain patients 
who misuse/abuse their prescription opioids , we hypothesize that the combination of ACT with MBRP 
may be particularly suited for treating this population.  Other interventions (e.g., cognitive -behavioral 
therapy, exercise therapy) were also considered; however, our recent work has suggested that both ACT 
and MBRP may be superior or more suitable in comparison to these other interventions.  Also, ACT and 
MBRP are theoretically aligned, which makes their combination more seamless than other interventions 
that are not theoretically aligned.  Several research designs incorporating ACT and MBRP were also 
considered (e.g., including an MBRP -only condition, a wait -list control group, or a no -treatment control 
group); however, these designs were ruled out because 1) MBRP was designed and has been 
empirically supported as an after -care intervention and has not been empirically studied as a stand -alone 
intervention for chronic pain, and 2) wait-list and no -treatment control groups were considered unethical 
for a treatment seeking population already enrolled in treatment.  We hypothesize that training in ACT 
will help reduce pain interference and improve functioning and that the addition of the MBRP mindfulness 
skills to ACT will help individuals with chronic pain who currently meet criteria or are at high risk for opi oid 
misuse to reduce patterns of opioid misuse until they are no longer of clinical concern.  
 
4. SELECTION AND ENROLLMENT OF PARTICIPANTS  
 
Recruitment Sites and Participants — This study will recruit veterans with chronic pain ( n = 120) who are 
misusing, abusing, or dependent on prescription opioids .  Participants will be recruited from the Co-
Occurring Disorders Clinic (a specialty clinic for patients with chronic pain and evidence of problematic 
opioid use), as well as the Ambulatory Care and Primary Care Clinics of the Raymond G. Murphy VA 
Medical Center  in Albuquerque, New Mexico.   
 
The Albuquerque VA is an ideal recruitment site for the present study for several reasons. First, it has 
approximately 321,140 veterans enrolled in Primary and Ambulatory Care and facility records indicate 
that nearly a quarter of these are currently prescribed chronic opioid therapy as defined by a prescription 
of 90 or more days.  Second, the issue of comorbid chronic pain and problematic opioid use has been 
identified as a priority within this VA, such that a specialty medication management clinic has been 
established.  This clinic receives approximately 25 referrals per month, with only approximately 30% of 
these appropriate for the primary treatment option of Buprenorphine (an opioid agonist)50.  These data 
suggest that there is a large proportion of patients who are seeking help for chronic pain with potential 
opioid misuse who are in need of intervention beyond the currently available treatment options. These 
individuals, as well as veterans in Primary and Ambulatory Care, may be appropriate for recruitment into 
the present study. Finally, the close proximity and history of collaboration between the University of New

progress. Historically, Veterans treated at the Albuquerque VA are primarily male, average 62 years of 
age, and are of considerable racial/ethnic diversity, including over 40% Hispanic and about 10% Native 
Americans.   
 
Recruitment methods: The study PI and the research team will work closely with staff in Co-Occuring 
Disorders, Primary and Ambulatory Care clincs at the VA Medical Center. In -service seminars will be 
held to explain the purpose of the study and eligibility criteria to hospital staff at the beginning of the 
study and periodically throughout the recruiting period. An IRB approved recruitment flyer will also be 
distributed to these clinics (see Microsoft Publisher attachments to protocol materials for IRB approved 
flyer and informational brochure ). 
 
Before a patient is contacted  by the study team , the patient’s primary clinician will be asked to: a) confirm 
patient is between the ages of 21 -65; b) confirm a chronic pain diagnosis of six months or longer; c) 
review medications to confirm that patient has been prescribed opioids for ninety days or longer; d) 
confirm that patients pain severity level has been four or greater over the past seven days on a 0 to 10 
scale, where 0 is no pain and 10 is worst pain possible and e) provide the patient with the study flier 
describing the study and invite the patient to meet with the research team to learn about the study and 
be screened for eligibility.  If the patient expresses interest in the study and requests that the study team 
contact him/her for screening, the primary clinician will then alert the study PI via the electronic medical 
record or with PKI encrypted email containing name and last four indicating that the patient is interested 
in being contacted for screening.  No assessments will be administered for research purposes, including 
screening, until the patient has signed the informed consent.  
 
Once potential participants have made voluntary contact with the investigators (e.g. after seeing a 
study flier at the VA facility) or once a member of the research team makes contact with potential 
participants after they express interest to their treatment providers, a full screening will take place 
via telephone to confirm eligibility for the study (using the Telephone Screening Form, which 
contains all exclusion and inclusion criteria listed in section 5). In order to inquire about PHI 
relevant to al l inclusion and exclusion (i.e., designated special population membership) criteria, 
the investigators have obtained a HIPPA waiver  from the governing IRB . Further, details of the 
study will also be discussed to better inform potential participants about the study requirements. 
Potential participants will be free to ask any questions about the study. At no time during the 
telephone screen is identifiable information collected that can link answers  to the potential 
participant. If participants meet the above eligibility criteria and remain interested in taking part in 
the study, an appointment will be set up to meet with the participant at the data collection site, 
which take place in a private office. At this appointment, the participant will complete all baseline 
assessment information. In the event that a potential participant is ineligible or declines to take 
part in the study, any protected health information will be destroyed pursuant to VA information 
security policy.  The electronic medical record will be utilized to alert the primary care provider that 
a patient on his/her panel has been enrolled in the study and which  study arm the patient was 
assigned to.  The payment schedule as according to the section of the Protocol on Participant 
Compensation will be clearly explained to potential participants during the consent process and 
following assignment into study condition.  
 
4.1 Inclusion Criteria  
 
All participants must meet the following inclusion criteria: 1) be between 21 and 65 years old; 2) have 
had chronic pain for >6 months in duration; 3) averaged 4 or greater on usual pain intensity over the past 
week on a scale of 0 –10 with medication;  4) daily use of prescribed opioids for chronic pain for at least 
90 consecutive days preceding assessment;  5) identified as having current opioid misuse [Current Opioid 
Misuse Measure (COMM) score of  > 12]3 or meeting diagnostic criteria for opiate abuse or dependence 
based on the Structured Clinical Interview for the DSM (SCID)56; 6) consent to randomization of 
 
A pilot study of integrated treatment for Veterans with chronic pain and opiate misuse   11 of 76 
 
Version 1. 1 (Date: 22 January 201 5) treatment to usual care with or without ACT+MBRP; 7) be willing to consent to assessment procedures 
and to be contacted for follow -ups; and 8) the ability to read written English.  
 
4.2 Exclusion  Criteria  
 
With regard to exclusionary criteria, participants will not be eligible for study participation if they: (1) meet 
diagnostic criteria for current substance abuse/dependence on a drug other than opioids , (2) meet 
diagnostic criteria for a current or past DSM diagnosis of schizophrenia, delusional disorder, psychotic or 
dissociative disorders, (3)  are currently prescribed medications for opioid addiction (e.g., 
Buprenorphine/Naloxone/Suboxone). , or (4) history of suicide attempts or inpatient hospitalization for risk 
of suicide in the past six month. In addition, we will screen for significant suicidal ideation (e.g., marked 
intent or established plan) using a self -report measure at the baseline, post -treatment, and follow -up 
assessments. If significant ideation exists, the study RA will contact the VA’s Acute Psychiatric Clinic, 
which provides on -call and immediate consultation and liason  services for the VA. The service is often 
consulted when significant ideation is identified.  
 
During the study period, participants may become ineligible and may be involuntarily removed. The 
conditions for removal are detailed in the Consent Form. These conditions are summarized as follows: 
(1) Individuals may be removed if the study team discerns a significant worsening of stress or mood 
symptoms  as a result of study participation , (2) if an participant is incarcerated, they cannot attend 
treatment sessions and will be remvoved, (3) if an individual becomes pregnant, their primary care 
provider will wean them off of opioids (due to documented birth defect risk associated with opioid use) 
which will render the participant ineligible for the study as they will no longer be taking opioids, and (4) if 
the participant displays behaviors that are deemed overly disruptive to other participants in the treatment 
group.  
 
4.3 Study Enrollment Procedures   
 
A brief screening questionnaire that inquires about eligibility criteria will be administered via telephone to 
patients receiving opioid therapy as part of their treatment for chronic pain at the VA who are interested 
in participating in the research study.  Interested individuals who meet initial screening criteria will be 
seen at the VA for an in -person screening where the procedures and voluntary nature of the study will be 
fully explained.  Participants will meet with a trained Research Assistant (RA) in a  private assessment 
office at the VA for the opioid use and psychiatric screening and to obtain Human Research Protections 
Office (HRPO) approved informed consent.  The in -person screening will consist of self -reported opioid 
misuse behaviors on the COMM , as well as a structured clinical interview using the Substance Use 
Disorders model of the SCID, which will enquire about opioid use patterns.  
 
Anticipated wait time from screening to baseline assessment and randomization.  After the initial 
screening, eligible participants will be scheduled for an in person assessment to complete informed 
consent and baseline assessments. This assessment will occur within 14 days (and ideally within 7 days) 
of screening. Immediately following completion of informed consent and assessment, participants will be 
randomized to treatment condition.  
 
Anticipated wait time from randomization to intervention beginning . We plan to begin at least one new 
group per month, therefore, wait time for most participants is anticipated to be less than one month from 
the time of study enrollment. As noted, we have planned for recruitment of eight individuals per month, 
which corresponds to our target group size. Should recruitment be faster than expected, we can 
accommodate up to ten individuals in each group to keep waiting times to a minimum. Furthermore, by 
the third month of providing intervention , we will be running three treatment groups at any one point in 
time (as each group will receive treatment for three months total). If the participant backlog surpasses six 
individuals (which is sufficient to compose a group for treatment), we will be able to add a fourth 
treatment group.

5. STUDY INTERVENTIONS  
 
5.1 Interventions, Administration, and Duration   
 
Intervention Conditions —All participants will continue to receive standard care for chronic pain within the 
VA.  In addition, one -half of participants will be randomized to also receive ACT plus MBRP.  
 
Standard Care :  All conditions will also receive standard treatment as usual, as indicated by treatment 
plan and not manipulated by the research team.  Consistent with national and VA standards14,15, care at 
the recruitment sites typically consists of noninvasive interventions, such as analgesic pain medications 
(e.g., opioids, NSAIDs, anti -epileptics), topical solutions (e.g., lidocaine), physical therapy, and massage, 
as well as limited invasive interventions (e.g., injections, radiofrequency denervation).   
 
Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (Weeks 2 –9):  The ACT intervention is based on the standardized 
and manualized protocol of Vowles and Sorrell16, which consists of weekly 90 -minute group meetings 
over eight weeks. The protocol has been successfully used in previous clinical trials (e.g., 17,18) and is 
currently available on the VA’s Evidence -Based Practice Sharepoint website.  Over the course of the 
group meetings, participants will identify areas of meaningful functioning that have been adversely 
impacted by pain, learn methods to enhance pain willingess in the service of these meaningful areas, 
and practice present -focused awareness skills.  Group sessions will include discussions of the impact of 
pain and distress avoidance, identify alternative to this avoidance and establish plans for behavior 
change, demonstration and role -playing exercises, and homework assignments.  Participants will be 
provided with a treatment manual to help guide and inform practice outside of group sessions. Table 1 
provides an outline of session content for the eight week ACT intervention. We anticipate enrolling 
approximatley eight patients per group.   
 
Table 1: Overview of ACT Treatment Sessions  
Session  Objectives and Content  
1 a. Treatment orientation and overview . 
b. Review treatment history and evaluate it in terms of how it has worked relative to patient’s 
 goals and expectations.  
 
2 a. Review interactions among thoughts, feelings, and action, which often serve to make one 
 another worse (e.g., become a “vicious cycle”).  
b. Exercises to attempt to control thoughts and/or emotions. Review patient experiences about 
 the difficulty inherent in control attempts.  
c. Introduce the idea that changes in action may mean changes that directly contribute towards 
 meaningful and successful living (i.e., values), rather than changes in  stubborn, avoidant, or 
 “just do it” way s. 
d. Introductory awareness training practice consisting of 2 short exercises (sitting and breathing) 
 and 1 longer exercise (breathing). All exercises followed by discussion to review experience.  
 
3 a. Values clarification exercises. Emphasis on identification and awareness. May include analysis 
 of ways in which patients’ lives have not been as values -oriented as they would like since pain, 
 and the effort to control it, has begun.  
b. Awareness training (breathing). Emphasis on awareness and “just noticing”, including noticing 
 distractions.  
 
4 a. Continued values clarification, emphasis on personal values versus those that are dictated by 
 others.

Version 1. 1 (Date: 22 January 201 5) b. Discussion of barriers and exercises exploring possibilities for values -based action with 
 continuing aversive experiences. Exercises relating to willingness and unwillingness to have 
 discomfort.  
c. Introduction to effective goal setting, as related to values.  
d. Awareness of body sensations exercise, followed by discussion.  
 
5 a. Discussion of activity pacing and activity cycling . 
b. Exercises to raise awareness of language -based influences on action, including those that are 
 arbitrary or fail to work over the longer term. Purpose  is to increase awareness of these 
 processes and highlight opportunities for choosing to behave in ways consistent or inconsistent 
 with identified values.  
c. Awareness exercise (body awareness, including awareness of pain). Fewer cues and 
 guidance by therapist during exercise. Followed by discussion of experience.

 of honest, non -avoidant observation.  
c. Discussion of effective communication.  
 
7 a. Awareness exercise, pertaining to the ways in which humans add additional, often 
 unnecessary, distress onto already distressing situations.  
b. Continued discussion of willingness, especially related to meaningful living.  
c. Walking mindfulness exercise, preferably outside of treatment room.

Mindfulness Based Relapse Prevention (Weeks 10 –13):  The MBRP program is a standardized group 
psycho -educational intervention that consists of weekly 90 -minute group meetings lasting from four19 to 
eight weeks20.  For the current study, we will use the four -week program, which will eliminate redundancy 
with the ACT protocol (the eight -week MBRP group has some redundancy with ACT) and will also 
expand upon the eight  weeks of ACT by focusing on reactivity to substance cues, opioid misuse, and 
nonjudgmental awareness.  Briefly, participants will be instructed in mindfulness techniques aimed at 
increasing concentration, improving awareness, and cultivating a nonjudgmental and accepting attitude 
toward craving and automatic thought patterns.  Group sessions include discussions of mindfulness as a 
means of coping with craving and painful cognitions, role -playing exercises, meditation practice, and 
homework assignments.  Each participant will be given audio CDs developed specifically for MBRP for 
independent practice outside of the group sessions.

Session  Objectives and Content  
9 a. Treatment orientation and overview . 
b. Introduce the concept of “automatic pilot” in relation to opioid use and the tendency to act upon 
 cravings, pain, or other negative -affective states without awareness.  
c. Discussion of triggers for opiate use that include situations, thoughts, emotions, and  
 sensations (including pain),  
d. Mindfulness exercise to increase awareness in daily life.

 and negative thoughts leading to opiate misuse and craving.  
c. Introduce the “SOBER” breathing space as an exercise that can be used to deal with 
 craving and other discomfort in the moment.  
12 a. Review home practice of the SOBER breathing space and triggers/challenges over past 
 week.  
b. Discuss lifestyle balance and increasing daily activities that are nurturing, while reducing 
 depleting activities or those activities that can trigger opiate misuse.  
c. Create reminder cards with people to call and alternative activities to prevent opiate misuse.  
d. Preparation for incorporating mindfulness into daily life and building a support network.  
e. Concluding meditation and closing discussion of skills learned throughout the past 12 
 weeks.

Version 1. 1 (Date: 22 January 201 5) 5.2 Handling of Study Interventions   
 
Interventions will be delivered in a group format . The target number of participants for each group will be 
up to eight  individuals, although it is possible to conduct the group with as few as four participants or as 
many as ten. Both interventions will be manualized as described in section 5.1 above. Due to the nature 
of the intervention, blinding to condition will not be possible.  
 
Number of therapists: There will be a minimum of two study therapists for each group (one the RA paid 
on the grant and the other a volunteer RA). Study therapists will be appointed through the University of 
New Mexico’s (UNM) graduate program in clinical psychology . The volunteer RA will receive practicum 
credit through UNM in lieu of payment. All therapists will be advanced post-Masters degree doctoral 
students (i.e. with necessary approval of the UNM’s Clinical Committee to engage in clinical work) who 
will have received four and one half days of training (32.5 hours total) in ACT (provided by Dr. Vowles ; 
training completed January 2015 ) and MBRP (provided by Dr. Bowen ; training completed December 
2014 ). Prior to leading any treatment sessions, therapists will be required to demonstrate a minimum 
level of competency, as outline by ACT and MBRP training guidelines.  Instructors will also receive 
weekly supervision from an outside supervisor with specific expertise in ACT and MBRP.  
 
5.3  Concomitant Interventions   
 
Standard care, which will be received by all participants, will proceed as indicated by the patient’s pre -
existing treatment plan (as determined by their primary care of speciality pain treatment provider). As 
noted above, standard care will be consistent with national and VA standards14,15, and will therefore 
typically include noninvasive interventions, such as analgesic pain medications (e.g., opioids, NSAIDs, 
anti-epileptics), topical solutions (e.g., lidocaine), physical therapy, and massage, as well as limited 
invasive interventions (e.g., injections, radiofrequency denervation).   
 
Prohibited  interventions, as noted in section 4.2 above will include: (1) active treatment for substance 
abuse/dependence for a drug other than opiates opioids (as this active treatment would indicate current 
criteria for substance abuse/dependence for that other drug); (2) current prescription of medication for 
opioid addiction (e.g., Buprenorphine/Naloxone/ Suboxone, Methadone).  
 
5.3.1  Allowed Interventions  
 
All interventions noted in section 5.3 as “standard care” will be allowed. Aside from the medications 
noted in section 5.3 (e.g., Buprenorphine/Naloxone/Suboxone, Methadone) , there will be no drug 
restrictions (e.g., opioids, NSAIDs, anti -epileptics, anti -depressants are all allowed).   
 
5.3.2  Required Interventions  
 
N/A 
 
5.3.3  Prohibited Interventions  
 
No interventions for pain treatment will be prohibited.  
 
5.4 Adherence Assessment  
 
In relation to the primary aims of this study, concerning recruitment and retention, no pre -determined 
adherence requirement will be established. We will track treatment attendance for all participants and 
examine it as part of our evaluation. We have no plans to exclude patients for non -adherence, nor do we 
have plans to restrict re -entry into treatment following a period of absence.

Version 1. 1 (Date: 22 January 201 5) 5.4.1 Therapist Adherence: Treatment fidelity in ACT will be assessed using the ACT Core 
Competency Rating Form (ACT -CCR)57 and in MBRP will be assessed using the MBRP Adherence and 
Competence Scale (MBRP -AS)58.  Inter -rater reliability of adherence ratings will be ascertained by 
double coding randomly selected practitioner audiotapes throughout the course of the 12 -week 
treatment.  Therapists who consistently fail to meet the criteria rating on adherence checklists will be 
decertified and will be required to undergo remedial training before they are allowed to resume seeing 
participants.

6.2 Description of Evaluations   
 
6.2.1  Screening Evaluation  
 
Screening  
 
Once potential participants make contact with the study team to voice interest in taking part in the study, 
a brief screening questionnaire that inquires about eligibility criteria will be administered via telephone. 
The screening questionnaire will determine if the participant is:  
 
(a) Between 21 and 65 years of age.  
(b) Has experienced pain daily for at least the past 6 months  
(c) Has been taking prescribed opioids for the treatment of chronic pain daily for at least the past 3 
 months  
(d) Experiencing average weekly pain of a four or greater on a 0 -10 scale of pain intensity  
 
Each of these criteria will be evaluated by “yes/no” responses from potential participants  and responses 
recorded on our IRB -approved telephone script assessing these details (see Appendix I). 
 
Consenting Procedure  for Screening  
 
There will be two consenting procedures. The first will be part of the telephone screening evaluation. Our 
IRB has approved the telephone script and determined that verbal consent to complete the screening  is 
allowed.  
 
The consent for screening and screening procedure will take place within a single telephone 
conversation. Study RAs will complete the procedure . All study RAs have completed the appropriate 
Human Subject’s Protection Training (completion certificates on file with our local IRB).  
 
For most participants, screening will be completed < 30 days prior to entry into the treatment study (as a 
new course of treatment will begin each month). In some cases, participant preference may delay entry 
into treatment.

Version 1. 1 (Date: 22 January 201 5) 6.2.2  Enrollment, Baseline, and/or Randomization  
 
Study consenting, enrollment, baseline assessment, and randomization will all take place during a clinic 
visit. All procedures will be completed by study RAs.  
 
Consenting Procedure  for Enrollment  
 
This study will follow the Informed Consent Process for Research  (UNM HRP -090).  Each  participant ’s 
consenting process will be recorded by the study RA. The consent document will be stored in a locked 
cabinet in Co-I Gilliam’s office in the VA. No minors will be involved in this study, thus parental/guardian 
permission and minor assent is not relevant. None of the identified groups of vulnerable populations are 
included in this study.  
 
The informed consent process will take place in a private office , and  participants will have the opportunity 
to choose their seating, read the consent form , and ask any questions they may have at the beginning of 
the data collection session. Signed consent forms will be transported in a locked file separate from other 
paper measures. Participants will be reminded that their involvement in this study is completely 
voluntary, and that they can withdraw it any time without any negative repercussions whatsoever (e.g., 
with regard to clinical care or healthcare access). They will also be explicitly told that they may leave any 
question blank for questionnaires or unanswered for the clinical interview if they do not feel comfortable 
answering.   See Appendix II for the consent form.  
 
Non-English Speaking Participants  – Individuals who do not speak or understand English will not be 
recruited to the study. While we recognize the limitations of this approach, practical considerations 
necessitate the inclusion of only those who are able to speak or understand English.  
 
Enrollment date will be recorded on a case report form , which will also include documentation of 
inclusion/exclusion criteria . See Appendix III for case report form and site screening & enrollment log.  
 
Baseline Assessments  (Appendix IV)  
 
Demographic Information :  
- Patient demographic s (e.g ., gender , age, educational achievement)  
- Pain-related information (e.g., duration, location, history of treatment)  
Opioid Use :  
- Current Opioid Misuse Measure (COMM) - We will also collect information on current opioid 
misuse using the COMM , a measure of aberrant opioid -related behaviors over the past month3. 
The recommended cut -score of 12 has adequate sensitivity (77%) and specificity (77%) for a 
current diagnosis of prescription drug abuse3.  
 
- Structured Clinical Interview for DSM -IV (SCID) – The Substance Abuse and Dependence 
module of the SCID will be conducted with all participants.  
 
Clinical Outcome s:  
- Pain Behavior - PROMIS Bank v1.0 Pain Behavior  
 
- Pain Interference - PROMIS Bank v1.0 Pain Interference  
 
- Disability – Sickness Impact Profile  (SIP) – The SIP is a measure of health -related disability4. It 
has demonstrated utility in chronic pain settings and provides a detailed assessment of 
 
A pilot study of integrated treatment for Veterans with chronic pain and opiate misuse   19 of 76 
 
Version 1. 1 (Date: 22 January 201 5) functioning across multiple domains. The SIP has been widely used in chronic pain settings and 
has demonstrated sensitivity to intervention5,59,60. 
 
- Pain intensity, including current and least/most/usual over the past week, will be assessed via a 
0 (no pain) -10 (maximum possible pain) numerical rating scale  (NRS) . Assessing pain intensity 
via NRS is a widely -used and well -established method in studies of pain61,62. 
 
Randomization  
  
Randomization will occur following baseline assessment.  We will use a random order variable -sized 
block randomization procedure with block sizes of 2, 4, and 6.  The investigators will be blind to the size 
of each block and randomization allocation.  
 
6.2.3  Blinding  
PI Vowles and Co -I’s Witkiewitz (study statistician) , Gilliam, and Cardon will be blinded. Unblinded staff 
will include the Research Coordinator from the Biomedical Institute of New Mexico (BRINM) and 
Graduate Research Assistant as these individuals will handle randomization and deliv ery of treatment, 
respectively. These individuals will have no access to data and no involvement in data monitoring or 
analyses.  
 
6.2.4 Follow -up Visits  
  
Weekly Assessments  (Appendix IV)  
  
As noted, participants will complete assessments measures at each week’s visit. Measures will include:  
 
- Chronic Pain Acceptance Questionnaire (CPAQ8).  The CPAQ is a 20 -item measure of 
acceptance and willingness to have chronic pain.  It is perhaps the most widely used measure of 
pain acceptance in the literature and its  psychometric properties, factor structure, and sensitivity 
to treatment are well established9,10.   
 
- Self-Compassion Scale (SCS11).  The SCS is a 26 -item questionnaire, which evaluates numerous 
aspects of mindfulness and self -compassion.  Initial psychometric evaluations of the measure 
have provided support for its reliability and validity11.   
 
- Penn Alcohol/Drug Craving Scale (PACS12).  A modified version of the PACS will be used to 
assess both alcohol and drug craving.  The PACS is a 5 -item measure including questions about 
frequency, intensity, and duration of craving, and an overall rating of craving for the previous 
week.  The PACS has demonstrated good psychometric properties in our prior studies, including 
internal consistency reliability (α=.87) and criterion validity7,63. 
 
6.2.5 Completion/ Final Evaluation  
 
Six months following the last treatment session, all participants will again complete:  
 
- Pain-related information (e.g., duration, location, history of treatment)  
- Opioid Use - COMM   
- Pain Behavior - PROMIS Bank v1.0 Pain Behavior  
- Pain Interference - PROMIS Bank v1.0 Pain Interference  
- Disability – SIP

The Study Completion Record is in Appendix V.  
 
6.2.5.1 Participant Compensation  
 
Remuneration for each of the assessments is as follows: Participants will receive $60 for completion of 
the baseline session, $5 per week for completing weekly assessments during active treatment ($60 
total), $50 for completing the end of treatment assessment (week 13), and $50 for completing the six -
month follow -up (week 37), totaling $220. Individuals who complete all assessments will be given a $50 
bonus at the 6 -month follow -up, for a maximum compensation of $270.  
 
Participant costs per year are as follows:  
 
Year 1: $9,680  (64 baseline, 64 X $60=$3840; 64 weekly treatment, 64 X $60=$3840; 40 
post-treatment; 40 X $50=$2000 ). 
Year 2: $19,520  (56 baseline, 56 X $60=$3360; 56 weekly treatment, 56 x $60= $3360; 80 
post-treatment, 80 X $50=$4000; 88 six month follow -up, 88 X $50=$4400; 
88 bonus six month maximum completion, 88 X $50=$4400 ). 
Year 3: $3,200  (32 six month  follow -up, 32 X $50=$1600; 32 bonus six month maximum 
completion, 32 X $50=$1600 ). 
 
The participant compensation record is displayed in Appendix VI.  
 
7. SAFETY ASSESSMENTS  
 
No vulnerable classes of human participants will be targeted for recruitment, although it is possible that 
participants may, for example, become pregnant during the trial or be incarcerated. We do not foresee 
that the intervention conditions will cause harm to the fetus or distress the pregnant participant. 
In the case that a participant is incarcerated during the course of the study, the research team 
will make every attempt to provide the opportunity for completing assessments only if continued 
assessment presents no more than minimal risk and if adequate assurances can be made that 
parole boards will not take into account prisoners’ participation in the research in making 
decisions regarding parole or probation. Further, each prisoner must be clearly informed in 
advance that participation in the research will have no effect on his or her parole.   
 
Sources of Material : Research material will consist of data collected from participants using structured 
clinical interview and self -report questionnaires. The structured clinical interview will be conducted during 
the baseline assessment to evaluate for mood, anxiety, or psychotic disorders, as well as the presence 
of substance use disorders (prescribed opioid and otherwise). The self -report questionnaires will assess 
a range of relevant constructs, including demographic information (e.g., age, gender, educational 
history), pain -related details (e.g., location, duration, current and past treatments), hypothesized 
treatment mechanisms (i.e., pain acceptance, self -compassion, alcohol and drug craving), and aspects 
of current and past functioning and substance use behaviors (i.e., pain behavior, pain interference, 
aspects involved in current opioid use).  
 
A linkage between personal identification numbers (PINs) and individually identifiable private information 
(participants’ names and contact information) is necessary to facilitate follow -up communication. Great 
care will be taken to maintain the confidentiality of data provided by participants. All data collected on 
participants will be identified with a randomly generated, unique personal identification number (PIN). Commented [KV2]: Added Depression? BCMDI with suicide

A pilot study of integrated treatment for Veterans with chronic pain and opiate misuse   21 of 76 
 
Version 1. 1 (Date: 22 January 201 5) Master lists of PINs and individually identifiable private information will be stored in locked file cabinets 
and computers with restricted access, and will be available only to research staff on this project. The 
linkage and the individually identifiable private information will be destroyed at the earliest opportunity 
consistent with conduct of the research. All data will be collected specifically for the proposed research 
study.  
 
Potential Risks : Risks to participants are primarily psychological in nature and may include discomfort 
associated with answering sensitive questions (e.g., about mental health and substance abuse). The 
information requested may be viewed as private, and therefore the questions may be perceived as 
intrusive. The act of completing assessment materials may cause participants to become cognizant of 
certain behaviors and personal problems which may cause distress. In the event that a  participant 
becomes overly anxious, he or she will be evaluated for risk by a licensed mental health clinician. 
Participants are also asked to report on potentially illegal behaviors such as use of illicit and controlled 
substances. Answers to these questions could pose social and legal difficulties if this information were 
linked to their identity and became known to someone outside of the research team.  
 
The therapies employed in the current study, ACT and MBRP, do not involve any known risks. Both 
interventions have been empirically validated. However, participants could become anxious or distressed 
during a session, or they could arrive in crisis to a session. Should this occur , the therapist will abort the 
scheduled materials for that day and implement crisis reduction therapy. In the event of an emergency , 
therapists will be able to reach the PI or study Co -I’s (all of whom are licensed clinical psychologists , with 
the exception of Dr . Cardon, who is a licensed physician ) or another designated licensed psychologist 
who is on call for this purpose. Therapists will always have a list of licensed VA psychologists to call in 
the event of an emergency. This practice is standard in the VA and is used, for example, when trainee 
psychologists are in need of consultation or assistance.  
 
Finally, there is the risk that some participants may not benefit from the interventions.  
 
Adverse events will be identified and reported initially to Dr. Gilliam, as part of his role as VA Co -I. Dr. 
Gilliam will be responsible for the assessment, intervention and treatment (if necessary) of these adverse 
events and for the reporting of adverse events to the required oversight entities (i.e., Institutional IRB). 
The known potential risks will be described in the informed consent document and protocol. Study team 
members will no longer have access to paper or electronic records when they are no longer part of the 
research team.  
  
We believe this research does not cross the threshold of Minimal Risk for participants for the 
following reasons:  
 
1. There are no known substantial risks associated with questionnaire completion or with 
engagement in psychotherapy. While these activities may result in transient increases in 
distress, the evidence base reliably indicates that any distress associated with questionnaire 
completion is not sustained and engagement in psychotherapy is associated with decreases 
in distress for the majority of participants.  
2. Participant identifying information will not be stored beyond record of consent, which will not 
include a record of whether an individual provided full data/achieved completion of study 
procedure.  
3. Participants will not be informed of the results of any assessment procedure.  
4. Participant treatment providers, family members, friends, etc. will not be informed of the 
results of any assessment procedure.  
 
The approving IRB body has agreed with our risk assessment and granted us permission to conduct the 
study.

Version 1. 1 (Date: 22 January 201 5)  
7.1 Specification of Safety Parameters  
 
Recruitment and Informed Consent : The investigators have taken several steps to protect participants 
against potential risks inherent to the proposed research. First, every effort will be made to protect the 
confidentiality of participant records. We will obtain a Certificate of Confidentiality from the Federal 
government, because we are asking participants about the use of illegal drugs. However, complete 
confidentiality can never be absolutely guaranteed because records may be examined by personnel from 
the UNM Human Research Protections Office and because accidents or other unforeseen circumstances 
sometimes occur despite the best protections put in place. Participants will be informed of this possibility 
prior to signing any consent forms for this study. All records will be kept strictly confidential and will not 
be inspected by any other agency except if required by law. Only research staff and staff of the UNM 
Human Research Protections Office will have access to PHI. Signed consent forms will be kept 
separately from any documents containing Personal Health Information (PHI) or participants’ unique ID 
numbers. The database linking ID numbers to participants’ identity will be kept separately from all PHI 
and ID numbers and only the PI and research staff on this study will have access to this link. Any hard 
copies of data (e.g., consent forms, audiotapes of sessions) will be kept in double locked rooms 
designated for the storage of PHI. Data will be destroyed 7 years after the last publication. The results of 
this research may be presented at meetings or in publications, however participants’ identities will not be 
disclosed. All computers with ID -coded data will be encrypted and password protected.  
 
Distress.  Potential psychological risks, including discomfort associated with disclosure of information, 
feelings of compromised privacy and distress that may be caused by increased awareness of one’s 
opiate misuse, will be addressed in the consent form. Participants will be encouraged to contact 
investigators and/or study staff if they have any concerns about their participation or if they experience 
any psychological distress. All study investigators are clinical psychologists with extensive experience in 
the treatment of chronic pain  and substance abuse and/or substance misuse, abuse, or dependence. 
They will train and supervise research staff and the study therapists to utilize data provided at each 
assessment point as well as clinical judgment to monitor and evaluate the condition of participants. 
Therapists will always have a list of licensed psychologists to call in the event of an emergency. If a 
participant discloses suicidal or homicidal intentions or ongoing child or elder abuse, the therapist will 
notify the licensed psychologist on call who will evaluate the participant for risk and follow the NM state 
law regarding mandated reporting. Therapists will disclose these limits of confidentiality to participants at 
their first therapy session. If a participant arrives for treatment or assessment in an intoxicated state, the 
therapist or research assistant will reschedule their session and be advised not to drive and seek 
appropriate transportation back to their homes. All participants will be informed of the right to withdraw 
from the study at any time and still receive full compensation for their time.  
 
 
7.2 Methods and Timing for Assessing, Recording, and Analyzing Safety Parameters  
 
N/A 
 
7.3 Adverse Events  and Serious Adverse Events  
 
As noted above, we deem the risk of adverse events to be negligible within this study. Adverse events 
can include a breach of study procedures (e.g., use of an expired consent form), distress requiring the 
services of a healthcare provider, or inadvertent breach of confidentiality.  
 
There is no evidence that participation in this treatment trial will increase risk of a serious adverse event.  
 
All adverse events will be recorded and reported within 5 days of occurrence, as required by our IRB of 
record (https://spa.unm.edu/common/documents/irb -guidelines.pdf).

Version 1. 1 (Date: 22 January 201 5)  
7.4 Reporting Procedures  
 
The PI of the study ( Dr. Vowles) will be responsible for reporting all adverse events to the IRB of record. 
The IRB uses the “Click” system ( http://hsc.unm.edu/som/research/hrrc/click.shtml ), which includes a 
reporting mechanism that is sent directly to the IRB. For any adverse events, a course of remediation will 
be proposed (e.g., in the event of a protocol violation, safeguards will be put in place to decrease the 
probability of repeated violation) to the IRB, although the IRB itself will approve/disapprove the 
remediation.  
 
7.5 Follow -up for Adverse Events  
 
All AE’s will be reported to the IRB of record within five days. Follow -up remediation will occur within five 
days of the IRB’s response or decision.  
 
7.6 Safety Monitoring   
 
We have established a Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) , consisting of three individuals. The first 
member is Professor Barbara McCrady , who is a Distinguished Profess or within the Department of 
Psychology at UNM and also  director of the Center on Alcoholism, Substance Abuse,  and Addictions 
(CASAA). She brings with her 40 years of experience conducting funded clinical trials with substance 
abusing populations . The second member is Professor Ronald Yeo, a Regents’ Professor within the 
Department of Psychology at UNM. Dr Yeo also has extensive experience working with complex clinical 
populations, chiefly schizophrenia and brain injury. He is also a member of the UNM Institutional Review 
Board (IRB) and has expertise in research ethics. The third and final member is Dr J Scott Tonigan, a 
Research Professor within the Department of Psychology and CASAA, as well as Chair of the UNM IRB. 
Dr Tonigan brings with him significant expertise in trial design and research ethics. He also is a highly 
accomplished statistician. Please see biosketches  for all three members of the DSMB in Appendix VII.  
 
8. INTERVENTION DISCONTINUATION  
 
- Participant choosing to discontinue.  
-  
- Because this is a feasibility trial, we will not discontinue intervention based on non -attendance.  
 
No other discontinuation criteria are identified.   
 
9. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 
9.1 General Design Issues   
 
Preliminary Analyses :  Data will be analyzed for missing cases to detect any bias across research groups 
that might result from differential attrition and/or response omission.  For example, participant 
characteristics to include gender, minority status, age, drinking history, pain duration and intensity, 
educational achievement, and previous treatment experiences will be compared for those participants 
retained in the study versus those lost to attrition.  Furthermore, the data will be examined for both 
missing cases and outlier scores on measures.  Variable distributions will be checked for normality and if 
necessary, transformations will be performed to normalize the distributions.  We will compare 
demographics and primary study measures at baseline between randomized treatment groups, using 
Analyses of Variance (ANOVA) for continuous variables (or Kruskal -Wallis if parametric assumptions are 
violated) and using chi -square tests for categorical variables.  Subsequent analyses will adjust for 
significant baseline differences among the randomized groups at α = 0.05.

Version 1. 1 (Date: 22 January 201 5) Analyses to Test Primary Aim Hypotheses :  The primary analyses for Aim 1 will be descriptive, including 
calculating the percent of individuals enrolled in the study versus those eligible and the percent of 
individuals who remain in the study.  We will pay particular attention to issues of retention, as the 
treatment program will occur over 12 weeks and this length may impact treatment completion (previous 
programs of ACT alone, which have lasted eight  weeks, have had drop -outs of < 20%17,21). Therefore, 
we will define multiple levels of treatment retention, including partial treatment completion (% of 
individuals who do not complete all sessions), treatment dropout (% of individuals who dropout of 
treatment but continue to do assessments), research dropouts (% of individ  
uals who remain in treatment, but do not complete research assessments), and treatment + research 
dropouts (% of individuals who do not complete treatment for research assessments).  We will further 
break down the enrollment and retention calculations by examining enrollment/retention differences by 
treatm  
.ent group, gender, age race/ethnicity, and initial severity using cross -classification tables.   
 
Analyses to Test Secondary Aim Hypotheses .  The primary goal of Aim 2 is to identify potential 
mechanisms of change and intermediate endpoints for future randomized clinical trials comparing 
ACT+MBRP to standard care.  We will accomplish this goal by examining initial level and changes in 
targeted mechanisms over time during the course of treatment, as well as the association between 
changes in targeted mechanisms during treatment and 6 -month follow -up measures of clinical outcomes.  
Targeted mechanisms will include (1) pain acceptance (2) psychological flexibility, (3) experiential 
avoidance, (4) opioid craving, and (5) reactivity to pain and craving, and will be examined using latent 
growth curve models with fixed effects of treatment and random effects of time.  These analyses will 
provide an estimate of the initial level of each targeted mechanism (i.e., intercept) and the change in the 
targeted mechanisms over time (slope).  Clinical outcome measures will include pain interference, pain 
behavior, and opioid misuse  and will be examined using mediation analyses within the context of latent 
growth curve modeling64, as we have done in prior studies63,65.  Specifically, as shown in simplified form 
in Figure 2, we will examine whether initial level (intercept) or changes (slope) in the targeted 
mechanisms (“M” in figure 2) during treatment mediate the effect of treatment on 6 -month clinical 
outcomes, controlling for baseline levels of the outcomes.  These analyses will also provide a test of Aim 
2 Hypothesis 2, which is to identify those measures that are most sensitive to change (measures with the 
largest slope).  Identifying measures that are more sensitive to change will help us in identifying 
intermediate endpoints for a larger RCT.  Validation of intermediate endpoints is challenging and it is 
often recommended that meta -analytic methods be used66, but alternative methods have been 
developed that allow for the evaluation of endpoints in mental -health clinical trials67.

models will be estimated using the product of coefficients method68, which provides an estimate of the 
mediated effect by multiplying regression coefficients for the regression of the mediators (e.g., slope of 
targeted mechanism) on treatment condition (i.e., a -path or α) and for the regression of the clinical

Version 1. 1 (Date: 22 January 201 5) outcome on the mediators (i.e., b -path or β).  We will use bootstrapping to obtain 95% confidence 
intervals of the mediated effect69.  We will use maximum likelihood estimation for all analyses, which 
provides the variance -covariance matrix for all available data and is the preferred method for estimation 
when some data are missing70.  Attrition analyses will determine whether there are any differences in 
study variables between those with missing and complete data.  Study variables associated with missing 
data will be covaried in all analyses.   
 
 
9.2 Sample Size and Randomization  
 
Statistical Power for Secondary Aims :  We estimated statistical power for the mediation analyses using 
parameter estimates from prior studies of mediation following ACT for chronic pain5 and following MBRP 
for substance use disorders7,63 to estimate the effect sizes for the behavioral measures in the current 
study.  Following ACT, numerous behavioral measures significantly mediated changes in disability, 
depression, pain -related anxiety, medical visits, and number of classes of prescribed analgesics, with 
large mediation effect sizes.  The prior studies of MBRP have found that experiential avoidance, 
awareness, and nonjudgment significantly mediated the association between treatment and changes in 
craving (α = 0.56; β = -0.43) and that craving significantly mediated the association between treatment 
and changes in substance use (α = -0.20; β =0.71).  Based on these effect sizes and power estimates for 
testing mediation derived from a simulation study71, we will have power greater than 0.80 to detect 
significant mediating effects with the proposed sample size of 120.   
 
Examining mechanisms of change assumes that treatment influences change in the clinical outcome 
measures at follow -up, thus we also estimated the power to detect a main effect of treatment on the 
clinical outcome measures.  Effect size estimates were drawn from prior studies of ACT for patients with 
chronic pain5,23,60,72 and MBRP for substance use disorders52,63,73.  The effect sizes for ACT in 
comparison to treatment as usual or active treatment for chronic pain have ranged from 0.29 to 1.09.  
The effect sizes for MBRP in comparison to treatment as usual for substance use and craving have 
ranged from 0.21 to 0.52.  Based on these studies, we estimate a minimum average effect size of 
d=0.25.  Using a mixed -effects linear model with α=0.05 (two -tailed test), three repeated assessments 
(baseline, end of treatment, 6 -month follow -up), and a correlation among repeated measures of 0.43 
(based on prior studies) we will need 60 subjects per condition (total n = 120) for 80% power to detect a 
main effect of ACT+MBRP in comparison to standard care.   
 
Treatment Assignment Procedures  
 
We will use a random order variable -sized block randomization procedure with block sizes of 2, 4, and 
6. The investigators will be blind to the size of each block and randomization allocation.  
 
9.3  Definition of Populations  
 
Because of the primary aim of feasibility, and corresponding dependent variables of recruitment and 
retention, we do not plan to differentiate ITT and per protocol populations for the analyses.  
 
9.4 Interim Analyses  and Stopping Rules  
 
We have no plans for interim analyses.  
  
9.5 Outcomes  
 
Please see response to Section 9.1 above. We have no plans for outcomes to be reviewed and 
adjudicated by a committee.  Commented [KV4]: Blocking

9.5.1 Primary Outcome   
 
The outcome for Aim 1 will be descriptive, including calculating the percent of individuals enrolled in the 
study versus those eligible and the percent of individuals who remain in the study.  We will pay particular 
attention to issues of retention, as the treatment program will occur over 12 weeks and this length may 
impact treatment completion (previous programs of ACT alone, which have lasted eight  weeks, have had 
drop-outs of < 20%17,21. The assessment of this latter primary outcome will occur at each treatment 
meeting (as this is the only way to assess retention) and follow -up. 
 
9.6 Data Entry and Analyses   
 
Data will be entered into the Statistical Package for Social Sciences Software (SPSS; IBM Corp). We will 
update the software license yearly so that the most recent version is used (currently version 22 is used). 
We will use an audit trail for entry, which will include a “sign -in” mechanism, where each session of data 
entry will be recorded. Recorded information within this mechanism will include the RA doing data entry, 
as well as case numbers entered and descriptive information with regard to the data entered (e.g., 
“cases 14 -19; post -treatment data entered”. A new database will be saved and individually labeled after 
each session of data entry (e.g., NCCIH R34 – Jan.22.2015).  
 
In addition to responses to section 9.1 and 9.2, where details regarding the data analyses can be found, 
the following information addresses the queries listed in the instructional set for completing this protocol. 
We do not anticipate any confounding variables, although we will assess for the role of gender, age, 
ethnicity, educational achievement, pain duration, and pain location in influencing dependent variables.  
 
10. DATA COLLECTION AND QUALITY ASSURANCE  
 
10.1 Data Collection Forms   
 
All data will be collected by study RAs in a pen -and-paper format. Each participant’s  data will be coded 
with their Personal ID number (PID).  
 
10.2 Data Management   
 
All initial data storage will be performed by study RAs. It will be double entered and checked for 
accuracy. All data will be stored initially at the Albuquerque VA on a password -protected computer in a 
locked office within a patrolled area (Co -I Dr. Gilliam’s office ). Once all data are collected and ready for 
analysis, data will be transported to the Department of Psychology onto a password -protected  computer 
in a locked office suite (PI Dr. Vowles’ laboratory space) for data analysis. At the time of transport , data 
will be de -identified and a back -up copy will be kept on the VA premises. All data collection forms are 
displayed in Appendix IV and detailed in Section 6. 2. 
 
10.3 Quality Assurance  
 
10.3.1   Training  
 
 
All staff will complete the human participants protection training required by the University of New Mexico 
(UNM). The University uses the “CITI” training program (Collaborative Institutional Training Initiative; 
https://www.citiprogram.org/ ). All study members have completed the “Social and Behavioral Research” 
Training program, which includes 13 modules, including:

foresee any reasonable risk of Serious Adverse Events). See Appendix V III for all forms.  
 
10.3.5   Monitoring  
 
We will monitor data and safety issues throughout the study. See Data and Safety Monitoring Log in 
Appendix IX. The study RA will be responsible for completion of the log, which will be reviewed by the 
Steering Committee at their monthly meeting.  
 
As noted in section 7.6, we have also established a DSMB. The DSMB will meet at least yearly to review 
Data and Safety Monitoring Logs. In addition, all adverse events will be reported to the DSMB on a 
monthly basis to allow for ad hoc DSMB meetings should the Board determine they are necessary. Any 
Serious Adverse Event will be reported to the DSMB within 5 days and will occasion a meeting of the full 
Board to review the event within 30 days.

“The purpose of this screening interview is to see if you meet the criteria for taking part in our treatment 
study for people with chronic pain. This interview will take approximately 10 minutes . I am going to go 
through a list of questions. You may choose not to answer these questions. You also may choose to stop 
participating in this interview at any time; if you want to stop, please tell me. Information about you that 
you give me during this interview will be kept as confidential as possible as required by law.  
 
You can choose if you want or do not want to take part in this research  screening procedure – it is up to 
you. If you refuse to answer the questions or stop answering them at any time, there will be no penalty, 
and you will not lose any benefits to which you otherwise would be entitled.  
 
The risk to taking part in this interview is small. The screening interview is not designed to ask you for 
sensitive personal information, but it is possible that some people may feel uncomfortable answering 
these questions with a person they do not know. If you qualify to take part in the study and are interested  
in taking part, then I will record your name and information; this will be kept confidential, but there is a 
small risk that people outside of the research team could learn this information. If you are not interested  
in the study, then I will destroy the personal information you give me.  
 
There are no benefits to you to taking part in this screening interview. However, it is possible that the 
information from the study that we will be doing may help researchers to learn more and may benefit 
others in the future.  
 
If you do not want to answer these questions, you have other choices. You can talk to your doctor about 
chronic pain and treatment options. Your choice to participate or not participate in this screening 
interview will not affect your treatment in any way.  
                                                                                
You will not be paid for answering questions in this interview since it is only to see whether you qualify to 
take part in the study.  
 
If you have any questions, concerns or complaints at any time about the research study, Dr . Wes 
Gilliam,  or his/her associates will be glad to answer them at (505) 265 -1711. If you would like to speak 
with someone other than the research team, you may call the UNMHSC HRPO at (505) 272 -1129.”

A. Personal Statement  
I am an applied statistician trained in the tradition of NIH funded RCT’s investigating addiction -
focused interventions. I also have a long -standing commitment to the formal psychometric 
development of self -report questionnaires and semi -structured interviews in addictions research. 
Since 1993 I have served as an NIH measurement consultant, work that has contributed to the 
dissemination of two clinician -based assessment reference/training manuals. I also serve as the 
chair of the main campus Institutional Review Board for the University of New Mexico. I am facile in 
the application of the proposed analytic methods described in this application, and I have published 
extensively in the areas of moderated and mediated effects within the context of psychosocial 
interventions for substance abuse. I have substantial experience working with data safety and 
monitoring and am well -qualified to serve in this capacity on this project.

Review of the AA Literature: Clinical and Research Implications.  
This review is applying meta -analytic techniques to summarize the AA literature 1993 -2010. Initial 
efforts to identify relevant articles are now in progress. Analyses will first focus on the associations 
between AA attendance, drinking, and secondary outcomes.  The review will also report the 
magnitude of associations for mediation pathways in MOC research on AA, e.g. spirituality and social 
support. The moderating effects of study and sample characteristics will be reported, e.g., dual 
diagnosis, and the relative effectiveness of different therapeutic approaches to facilitate 12 -step 
attendance will be documented.

 Mechanisms of Change: Alcohol Behavioral Couple Therapy  
This study will identify if spousal behavior in couples therapy in the first therapy session predicts later 
drinking.  Other aims will test if couple interactions change through the course of therapy, how such 
changes may predict drinking, and how pretreatment couple characteristics moderate relationships of 
interest.  Existing audiotapes of 186 first session and 136 mid - treatment sessions from four 
randomized clinical trials of ABCT will be coded. Dr. Tonigan is a Co -I on this project and is 
responsible for the primary data analyses.

This is a naturalistic follow -up study of adolescents with substance abuse problems. The project has 
three primary aims: (1) to validate the “Helping Others” questionnaire, (2) to investigate faith -based 
mechanisms for sustaining service over time, and (3) to examine health and social outcomes in 
relation to youth involvement in service. Administered by Case Western University, Dr. Tonigan is a 
consultant on the project.

A Transtheoretical Model of AA -related Behavior Change  
This single -group longitudinal study recruited 253 AA -exposed adults from community -based AA and 
outpatient treatment.  Prospective hypotheses about the relative importance of change readiness, 
self-efficacy, perceived social group dynamics, and AA -specific change mechanisms, e.g., spirituality, 
have been tested with preliminary reports provided at RSA in 2009 and 2010.  Several papers are 
now under review reporting findings out to the 24 month follow -up.  An extended 5 year follow -up is 
currently in progess.

12-step Facilitation Adapted for the Dually Diagnosed  
This study adapted the 12 -step manual developed for Project MATCH for use with dually diagnosed 
clients (N = 121).  The primary objective of this adapted manual was to facilitate attendance in Double 
Trouble (DT), a mutual -help program for dually diagnosed substance abusers.  Follow -up was done at 
3, 6, 9, and 12 months, and attendance and commitment to DT and AA was closely monitored and 
documented.  The project is now in the data analysis phase. Dr. Tonigan is a Co -I on this project.

Therapeutic Mechanisms in AA  
This study investigated the plausibility that causal mechanisms identified in the core AA literature 
accounted for AA -related benefit, i.e., reduced anger and selfishness and increased spirituality. We 
recruited 130 alcohol dependent adults from community -based AA and outpatient treatment with 
limited treatment and AA histories and interviewed them at intake, 3, 6, and 9 -months.  Preliminary 
results have been reported at RSA in 2010 and several papers are now under peer -review.

Section 7.1Inclusion CriteriaInclusion criteria #6 on life expectancy 
of the patient made not applicable .While investigators are 
still expected to use 
their best judgment in 
enrolling patients who 
they expect could 
remain on study 
reasonably long enough 
to assess safety and 
efficacy of study 
treatments, it was 
determined that being 
able to quantitate life 
expectancy is quite 
difficult, thus it was 
removed as a specific 
criterion for inclusion.

Section 7.2Exclusion Criteria
Section 8.5Excluded Concomitant 
Medications and ProceduresThe 14 -day period of time off systemic 
steroids before C1D1 start was reduced 
to 7 days.Because these steroids 
have a short half -life, a 
shorter wash -out period 
is better justified and 
optimal.

was updated to require resolution of 
symptoms and completion of any 
COVID -19 treatments within 7 days of 
enrollment or retreatment with study 
drugs. In the text about asymptomatic 
patients who test positive for 
COVID -19 during screening or 
enrollment ,the language was updated 
to require a 7-day waiting period from 
the time of po sitive test before
enrollment or retreatment. In addition, 
a negative COVID -19 polymerase 
chain reaction test is no longer a 
requirement for enrollment or 
retreatment in symptomatic or 
asymptomatic patients unless required 
per local guidelines. Also i nclud ed 
consultation with medical monitor.In response to evolving 
COVID -19 testing 
recommendations and

CONFIDENTIAL2.0 STUDY SUMMARY
Name of Sponsor(s) : Takeda Development Center Americas, Inc. Compound: TAK -676
Title of Protocol: An Open -Label, Phase 1, Dose -Escalation Study to 
Evaluate the Safety and Preliminary Antitumor Activity of TAK -676 With 
Pembrolizumab Following Radiation Therapy in the Treatment of Non –
Small -Cell Lung Cancer, Triple -Negative Breast Cancer, or Squamous -Cell 
Carcinoma of the Head and Neck that Has Progressed on Checkpoint 
Inhibitors.EudraCT No. : Not applicable
Study Number: TAK -676-1003 Phase: 1
Study Design:
This is an open -label, phase 1, dose escalation study to evaluate the safety, tolerability , and preliminary antitumor 
activity  of TAK-676 and pembrolizumab following radiation therapy in the treatment of non –small - cell lung cancer 
(NSCLC), triple -negative breast cancer (TNBC), or squamous -cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) patien ts 
who have progressed on checkpoint inhibitors (CPIs).
Approximately 65 patients with metastatic NSCLC, TNBC, or SCCHN will be enrolled in this study, to achieve a 
maximum of 55 dose -limiting toxicity  (DLT) evaluable patients. All patients will receive 8 Gy × 3 doses of 
image -guided radiation therapy, followed by intravenous (IV) administration of pembrolizumab and TAK -676. 
Pembrolizumab will be administered at 200 mg IV on Day 1 of ever y 21-day  cycle, with a minimum for 40 hours 
between the last fraction of radiation therapy and the initiation of IV pembrolizu mab. TAK -
676 will be administered 
in a dose -escalating fashion following the Bayesian Optimal INterval (BOIN) design, with an explorable dose range of 
0.2 to 9.0 mg administered on Days 1, 8, and 15 of ever y 21-day  cycle. Patients will only receive TAK -676 with 
pembrolizumab at dose levels that were previously deemed safe in the dose -finding phase 1 study TAK -676-
1002. 
Three patients will be enrolled in the initial cohort at the previously identified starting dose level of TAK -676. 
Subsequent cohorts will e nroll 2 to 3 patients per escalation/de -escalation guidelines. Administration of 
pembrolizumab (every 3 weeks) and TAK -676 (weekly) will continue until disease progression, intolerance to 
pembrolizumab or TAK -676 (defined as the development of a treatment -emergent adverse event [TEAE] that is at 
least possibly related to pembrolizumab or TAK -676 and for which dose discontinuation is recommended), or 
withdrawal of consent, whichever occurs first. 
Primary Objective:
The primary objective is:
To determine th e safety and tolerability of TAK -676 administered in combination with pembrolizumab following 
radiation therapy in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC, TNBC or SCCHN.
Secondary Objectives:
The secondary objectives are:
To determine the reco mmended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of TAK -676 administered in combination with 
pembrolizumab following radiation therapy. RP2D can be equal to or lower than the maximum tolerated dose 
(MTD).
To assess the preliminary antitumor activity of TAK -676 administered in combination with pembrolizumab 
following radiation therapy, both locally (in the radiation field) and systemically (nonirradiated lesions).
To evaluate the dose -responsive impact on T -cell infiltration in nonirradiated tumors following TAK -676 
administered in combination with pembrolizumab following radiation therapy.
Patient Population: Healthy male or female patients aged 18 years or older, with advanced NSCLC, TNBC, or 
SCCHN, who have progressed on CPIs.
Number of Patients:

Main Criteria for Evaluation and Analyses:
The primary endpoints are:
Frequency and severity of treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs).
Number of patients with DLTs.
Number/percent age of patients with 1 or more treatment -emergent serious adverse event (TESAE).
Number/percentage of patients with 1 or more TEAE leading to dose modifications and treatment 
discontinuation.
Safety endpoints will be evaluated according to the NCI CTCAE, V ersion 5.0.
The secondary endpoints are:
Response assessments are per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST )v.1.1 by investigator.
Overall response rate (ORR): confirmed complete response [cCR] + confirmed partial response [cPR].
Duration o f response (DOR) for all tumor lesions assessed by RECIST v.1.1. 
Time to response (TTR) for all tumor lesions assessed by RECIST v.1.1
Response assessments are per modified intratumoral immunotherapy Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
by investigator.
Overall response rate (ORR): cCR + cPR.
Overall response rate for tumors lying within the radiation field (ORRirradiated): confirmed complete response 
[cCRirradiated] + confirmed partial response [cPRirradiated] of tumor lesions lying within the radiation field.
Overall response rate for tumors lying outside the radiation field (ORRnonirradiated): confirmed c omplete 
response [cCRnonirradiated] + confirmed partial response [cPRnonirradiated] of tumor lesions lying outside of 
the radiation field.
DOR for tumors lying within the radiation field (DORirradiated), and for those lying outside of the radiation field 
(DORnonirradiated).
TTR for tumors lying within the radiation field (TTRirradiated), and for those lying outside of the radiation field 
(TTR nonirradiated).
The following endpoint will be assessed to evaluate T-cell infiltration into the tumo r between pretre atment and 
on-treatment biopsies:
– Cell infiltration evaluated by immunohistochemistry.
Statistical Considerations:
Dose escalation of TAK -676 will follow BOIN design to inform dose escalation decision and potential MTD 
estimation. Three patients will be enrolled in the initial cohort at the previously identified starting dose level of

Protocol Incorporating Amendment No. 2 18 February 2022
CONFIDENTIALTAK -676. Subsequent cohorts will enroll 2 to 3 patients per the escalation/de -escalation guidelines. The target toxicity 
rate is ϕ= 0.3. It is generally expected that at lea st 3 patients will enroll per cohort. However, if no DLTs have been 
identified in the TAK -676 + pembrolizumab dose level that has already been evaluated in the dose -finding phase 1 
TAK -676-1002 study, the sponsor, in agreement with the TAK -676-1003 investi gators, may opt to enroll a 2 -patient 
cohort at that same [radiation] + TAK -676 + pembrolizumab dose level being evaluated in the TAK -676-1003 study. 
To guide dose escalation decisions, if the observed DLT rate at the current dose is ≤0.236, the next cohor t of patients 
will be treated at the next higher dose level; if it is ≥0.358, the next cohort of patients will be treated at the next lower
dose level; if it is within 0.236 and 0.358, additional patients will be enrolled in this dose level. For the purpos e of 
overdose control, dose j and higher levels will be eliminated from further examination if Pr(p j>0.3 | data) >0.95, w here 
pjis the true DLT rate of dose level j. When the lowest dose is eliminated, the dose escalation will be stopped for 
safety. Dose escalation will continue until the maximum sample size (55 DLT -evaluable patients) is reached or the 
number of DLT evaluable pat ients treated at the current dose reaches 9. Isotonic regression method will be used on the 
cumulative DLT rate for each dose level to determine the MTD, defined as the highest TAK -676 dose in combination 
with radiation therapy and pembrolizumab that does not result in unacceptable toxicities.
Dose Escalation/De -escalation Rule for the BOIN Design
Number of patients treated at the current dose 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
Escalate if number of DLT ≤ 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 2
Deescalate if number of DLT ≥ 1 1 2 2 2 3 3 3 4
Eliminate if number of DLT ≥ NA NA 3 3 4 4 5 5 5
Number of DLT is the number of patients with at least 1 DLT.
Other dose escalation decisions, evaluation of intermediate doses, expansion of an existing dose level, and stopping 
the dose escalation early are all permissible following discussions between the sponsor and the investigators, if such 
measures are needed for patient safety, or for a better understanding of the dose -related toxicity, exposure, and/or 
pharmacodynamics. Other non -DLT safety and ava ilable clinical, pharmacokinetic, or biomarker data will also be 
considered to inform subsequent dose recommendations, dose escalation decisions, and potential MTD and RP2D 
estimation.
Safety will be evaluated by the frequency of AEs, severity and types of AEs, AEs leading to dose modifications and 
treatment discontinuations, and other safety endpoints using the safety analysis set. The incidence of DLTs will be 
tabulated using the DLT -evaluable analysis set. ORR, ORRirradiated, and ORRnonirradiated will be summarized 
using descriptive statistics with 95% CI for the response -evaluable analysis set. DOR, DORirradiated, 
DORnonirradiated, TTR, TTRirradiated, and TTRnonirradiated will be analyzed descriptively using Kaplan -Meier 
method for response -evaluable ana lysis set.
Sample Size Justification: Approximately 65 patients with metastatic NSCLC, TNBC, or SCCHN will be enrolled in 
this study, to achieve a maximum of 55 DLT evaluable patients. They will receive pembrolizumab administered at 
200mg IV on Day 1 of ever y 21-day cycle, and TAK -676 admini stered in a dose -escalating fashion following the 
BOIN design, with an explorable dose range of 0.2 to 9.0 mg administered on Days 1, 8, and 15 of ever y 21-day cycle.

CONFIDENTIAL4.0 INTRODUCTION
Overco ming T cell inhibit ion in the tumor microenvironment (TME) with checkpo int inhibitors 
(CPIs) has proven to be a successful strategy to produce long -term benefit in a significant number 
of patients wi th metastati c solid tumors. Despite th ese advances, many  patients with advanced 
cancer are either refractory  to CPIs or relapse after a period of tumor control, eventually 
succumbing to their disease. Evolving data suggest that reduced interferon (IFN) signaling, 
immune escape through human le ukocy te antigen loss, as well as altered antigen presentation may 
contribute to CPI resistance (Jenkins et al. 2018 ; Minn and Wherry  2016 ; Sharma et al. 
2017) . Furthermore, an emerging consensus acknowledges that CPI resistance (relapse or 
refractory  in nature) m ay also be driven by tumor immunophenoty pe, specifically those tumors 
harboring an immunosuppressive or “immune desert” phenotype. Accordingly, one possible 
strategy  to overcom e these elements of resistance is to stimulate innate immune cells (myelo id 
cells, including ant igen-presen ting dendrit ic cells [DCs], granulocytes, eosinophils, neutrophils, or 
monocy tes/macrophages, as well as lymphoid cells, including gamma/delta T cells, natural killer 
[NK] cells, and NK T Cells) to condit ion the TME, thus turning immuno logically  “col d” tum ors 
into “hot” tum ors in which adapt ive immune responses can be effect ively activated.
Study  TAK -
676-1003 intends to evaluate the safety , tolerabilit y, and preliminary efficacy  of 
radiation therapy fo llowed by the co mbinat ion of pembro lizumab and the Stimulator of Interferon 
Genes (STING) agonist TAK- 676 as a m eans to stimulate an immune -mediated antitumor 
response in otherwise immuno logically col d tum ors.
4.1 STING Signaling and Innate and Adaptive Immune Response
STING i s a cy tosolic protein cri tical for the induct ion of t ypeI IFN -dependent innate immunit y 
(Ishikawa et al. 2009 )and is specifically  activated in the presence of cyclic dinucleotides (CDNs) 
derived from bacteria or produced by  cyclic GMP -AMP s ynthase (cGA S) (Sun et al. 2013; Wu et 
al. 2018 ). Emerging evi dence i ndicates th at the cGAS -STING pathway  plays an important role 
specifically in driving tumor surveillance (Corral es and Gajewski 2015 ). The presence of cytosolic 
DNA in tumor cells leads to cGAS -dependent production of the second messenger 2′,3′-cyclic 
guanosine monophosphate –adenosine monophosphate (cGAMP), which may subsequent ly be 
transmitted to professio nal ant igen-present ing cells in the TME. Ultimately, this leads to induct ion 
of type I IFNs in DC s (Marcus et al. 2018 ). Type I IFNs and downstream regulated 
cytokines/chem okines serve as a potent “alert” to immune cells, including T cells and NK cells 
that may  prime ant itumor responses. Downregulat ion of cGAS via epigenet
ic silencing has been 
reported in so me human tum ors, underscoring the potential significance of STING signaling in 
immune evasio n (Konno et al. 2018 ).
4.2 Radiation Therapy and the Innate and Adaptive Immune Response
Radiotherapy is a pillar of cancer treatment with approximately 50% of cancer patients receiving 
radiotherapy  at som e point in the course of their disease (Delaney et al. 2005 ). In the setting o f 
metastati c disease of so lid tumors, including non– small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), triple -negat ive 
breast cancer (TNBC), and squamous cell carcinoma of head and neck (SCCHN), radiotherapy  is

CONFIDENTIALoften used wi th palliat ive intent. Techno logical advances have a llowed radi otherapy  to be 
delivered more precisely wit h such techniques as 3D conformal radiotherapy , image -guided 
intensity-modulated radi otherapy , and stereotactic ablat ive radiotherapy (Ahmad et al. 2012 ). 
With the increasing use of CPIs in these pat ients and the available evidence that radiat ion may 
enhance the immune response through activat ion of the STING pathway, there is much enthusiasm 
about combining radiat ion and CPI with the goal of improving tre atment outcom es (Vatner et al. 
2014) . Radiotherapy  has often been thought of as immunosuppressive due to the large treatment 
fields depleting peripheral lymphocytes through direct cell killing (Yovi no et al. 2013
). However, 
there is clinical evidence that focal radiat ion in conjunct ion with immune checkpoint blockade 
(ICB) can lead not only to reduced tumor size in the radiation field but also to a sy stemic di sease 
response, termed the “abscopal response,” in pat ients with metastati c disease, including NSCLC 
(Form enti et al. 2018 ; Vatner et al . 2014 ). This is thought to be through the release of tumor 
antigens by radiat ion-induced cell death in the context of endogenous adjuvants that facilitate 
priming of ant itumor lymphocy tes (Golden et al . 2012 ). This mechanism o f radiation-induced 
immunogenicit y invo lves the facilitat ion of tumor antigen uptake by DC and cross -presentation on 
major histocompatibilit y complex I, which is shown to be upre gulated by radiotherapy  in 
preclinical models (Formenti and Dema ria 2013 ; Reits et al . 2006 ). This enhanced presentation of 
antigens released by cytotoxic radiotherapy potentiates cross -priming of tumor -specific 
lymphocy tes in the lymph nodes, which may potentially prime an exhausted immune system in 
patients who are progressing on immunotherapy .
Local  radiotherapy  has been demonstrated to stimulate antitumor immune responses by increasing 
both apoptosis of tumor cells and subsequent antigen presentat ion and corresponding expression 
of immuno modulatory  genes (Liao et al. 2004 ). Local radiat ion may also work through a different  
mechanism, that of altering the TME to promote greater infiltration by immune effector cells 
(Lugade et al. 2008 ; Matsum ura et al. 2008 ; Zhang et al. 2007 ). Several studies have observed that 
the rapid reduct ion of tumor burden after ablat ive radiat ion therapy  depends on T cell responses 
(Gupta et al. 2012 ; Lee et al. 2009 ). Ablat ive radiation also increases T cell priming in draining 
lympho id tissues and reduces both the primary tumor and distant metastasis in a CD8 T cell –
dependent fashio n (Figure 4.a).
Preclinical tumor models have demonstrated that the immunogenic consequences of radiat ion are 
dependent on the cGAS/STING pathway  (Deng et al . 2014b ). Radi ation-induced DNA damage 
leads t o the generation of cytosolic DNA, which is sensed by cGAS. cGAS then catalyzes the 
producti on of  cGAMP, which act ivates STING in tumor cells and nearby DCs, result ing in 
downstream induct ion of IFN -β (Deng et al . 2014b ; Vanpouille -Box et al . 2017 ). IFN- β leads to 
enhanced ant igen uptake by DCs and cross -presentation to T cells (Deng et al . 2014b ). This 
recent ly redefined mechanism has bridged the tumor DNA damage response and host cell 
cytosoli c DNA -sensing pathways in the context of radiotherapy  (Figure 4.a).
The efficacy o f radiotherapy has been shown to depend on the host immune response, particularly 
the adaptive immune response. By  inducing apoptosis/necrosis of tumor tissues and subsequent 
release of DNA fragments and other danger signals, local high- dose radiation promotes 
inflammat ion (Apetoh et al. 2007) . The potential role of t ype I IFN in bridging the inflammat ion 
induced by  radiat ion has been invest igated, demonstrating that type I IFNs result in a

CONFIDENTIALtumor-reducing adapt ive immune response (Burnette et al. 2011 ) (Figure 4.a). It has also been 
shown that radiat ion increases the production of IFNβ in the TME. The implications of this 
increase are significant. The therapeutic effect of radiat ion is diminished in an IFNα/β receptor 
knocko ut host (Burnette et al. 2011 ).
Preclinical work i n tum or-bearing mice treated with radiat ion and intratumoral STING agonists 
inject ion provi des evidence for an immune -mediated combinat ion benefit. Deng et al. 
demonstrated that intratumoral delivery  of the STING agoni st 2′3′-cGAMP potenti ates the 
response of MC38 tum ors to radiation, and this combinat ion benefit is dependent on the presence 
of STING in the host mice (Deng et al. 2014b ). Similarly, a synthetic STING agoni st (RR -CDG) 
delivered intratumorally to Panc02 tumors potentiated the effects of radiation to these tumors, and 
the combination resulted in systemic T cell –mediated tumor suppression, including at distant 
tumor sites (Baird et al . 2016 ).

Cytosolic DNA sensing orchestrates tumor immunity during radiotherapy. Radiation results in the 
upregul ation of “find -me” and “eat -me” signals from tumor cells. During phagocytosis in mye loid 
cells, the DNA fragments hidden in irradiated tumor cells are re leased from phagosomes to 
cytoplasm, acting as a danger signal. The cy clase cGAS binds this DNA, becomes cataly tically 
active, and generates cGAMP as a second messenger. cGAMP binds to STING, which in turn

crosspriming of CD8 T cells, leading to tumor control. 
Because ty pe I IFN i s a potent inducer of programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD -L1), it was 
postul ated that (i ) radi ation resistance could be due to the engagement of T cell –negat ive 
regul atory  pathways, especially IFN -induced PD -L1 upregulation inside the tumor tissues; and (ii) 
anti-programmed cell death ligand 1 (ant i-PD-L1) treatment could overco me resistance to 
radiation therapy , further helping in eradicating t he tumor (Deng et al. 2014a ). Thi s has led to 
postul ating that programmed cell death protein 1 (PD -1)/PD -L1 inhibitors may be effect ive in 
potenti ating the effect of radiat ion therapy .
4.3 Radiation Therapy in Combination With CPI 
Multiple tri als have studi ed the combination of varying doses and schedules of radiation therapy  
with CPIs (primarily  pembrolizumab, i pilimumab, and nivo lumab) in metastatic so lid cancers, 
provi ding a preliminary  understanding of the ant itumor activit y andsafety  profile of this 
combinat ion. The principal trials in this area are summarized in Table 4.a. The side effect profiles 
of combinat ion radi ation the rapy and CPIs were generally  considered safe and tol erable, and 
mirrored those seen wit h CPIs alone, although with the addit ion of ant icipated local toxicit y from  
radiation (see Section 4.6.1 and Table 4.bfor addi tional details). As detailed in  Table 4.a, a wi de 
range of stereotactic radiat ion regimens have been utilized in these studies (20 –60 gray [Gy] in 3 –
5 fractions, given before or concurrent ly wit h CPI), with no clear superiorit y of one sched ule over 
another. The majorit y of the studi es listed in
 Table 4.ashowed a modest overall response rate 
(ORR) (8% -36%), but only two of these trials wer e randomized prospective trials co mpar ing CPI 
alone to CPI wi th stereotacti c radiat ion therapy  (24 Gy  or 27 Gy  given over 3 fractions (McBride 
et al. 2018 ; Theelen et al. 2019 )). Unfortunately, neither of these rando mized contro lled trials 
produced statist ically significant results, failing to clarify the optimally immunogenic 
dose/schedule for stereotactic radiat ion in this setting.

CONFIDENTIALIn vivo antitumor activit y of TAK -676 was also assessed in A20 tumors in BALB/c mice 
(syngeneic murine B Cell lymphoma model). TAK -676 exhib ited stati stically significant 
(p<0.001) antitumor activit y against the A20 tumor at both 1 and 2 mg/kg dose levels on a 
Q3D ×3 schedule. In 1 of 10 mice, complete regressio n was observed at 1 mg/kg, and in 2 of 
10mice, complete regressions were observed at 2 mg/kg.
The effect of TAK -676 on immune cell populat ions was evaluated in tumor -draining lymph nodes 
of C57BL/6J mice bearing B16F10 tumors (syngeneic murine melanoma model) by  flow 
cytometry. The resul ts dem onstrated DC activat ion within the lymph no des. In addit ion to 
DCactivat ion, T cell expansion and acquisit ion of effector T cell funct ions were al so observed in 
both the TME and local tumor -associ ated lympho id tissue.
4.4.1.2 Nonclinical Pharmacology of TAK -676 and CPIs
Com pelling nonclinical data also su pport the potential o f a systemic STING agonist when 
administered in combinat ion wit h systemic CPIs. In the A20 syngeneic model, the combinat ion of 
TAK -676 (0.25 to 0.5 mg/kg; Q3D ×3) and an anti –mouse PD -1 blocking antibody  (10 mg/kg; 
Q3D × 3 followed by once per week [QW] × 3) synergist ically suppressed tumor growth. 
Nonclinical synergy between STING agonism and CPIs has also been reported for other STING 
agonists (Ager et al. 2017; Ghaffari et al. 2018 ; Kinkead et al. 2018 ). The combinat ion of 
TAK -676 wi th an ant i–mouse PD -1 ant ibody  in tum or-bearing mouse models did not result in 
synergistic toxicit y, as assessed by increased or mortalit y enhanced body weight loss (BWL) whe n 
compared wi th TAK -676 al one. Addit ional details about the nonclinical pharmaco logy of 
TAK -676 can be found in the IB.
4.4.1.3 Nonclinical Pharmacology of TAK -676 With or Without CPI With Rad iation Therapy
Nonclinical evidence for the added benefit of STING agonism in co mbinat ion with radiati on has 
been generated in the EMT6 murine breast carcinoma model using 2 dist inct regimens of radiat ion 
treatm ent: 10 Gy  × 1 delivered by  focal beam radi ation with manual  posi tioning of tum or in the 
radiation field, and 8 Gy  × 3 delivered by focal beam radiat ion with volumetric image guidance 
from computed tomography (CT) scans. 
In the studies utilizing 10 Gy  × 1 delivered by  focal beam  radiat ion, combinat ion benefit with 
TAK -676 was demonstrated on several treatment schedules in 2 studies. In the first study , 
TAK -676 (1 m g/kg) was administered Q3D × 3, and 10 Gy  radiation was delivered in a single 
fraction, starting 2 days before, on the same day , or 2 day safter ini tiation of  TAK -676 dosing. In 
each case, the combinat ion of TAK -676 and 10 Gy radiat ion had an addit ive effect on growth 
inhibit ion of irradiated tumors compared with the effect of TAK -676 or radi ation alone. A second 
study  in EMT6 tum or-bearing mice also demonstrated addit ive effects of TAK -676 and radiation 
on growth inhibit ion of irradiated tumors (10 Gy  radiation delivered 1 or 2 days before, on the 
same day, or 1 or 2 days after init iation of TAK -676 on a Q3D × 3 schedule). In the first study , the 
combinat ion was well tolerated with no treatment -related m ortali ty, and BWL was wi thin 
acceptable limits for all groups. However, in the second study , 2 of 50 mice receiving 10 Gy × 1 
radiation and 1 mg/kg TAK -676 were remo ved from the study due to B WL. Co mpared wit h these

4.4.2 Nonclinical Pharmacokinetics
The absorption, distribut ion, metabo lism, and eliminat ion properti es of TAK -676 were 
characterized both in vitro and in vivo in BALB/c mice bearing A20 syngeneic tumors, 
Sprague Dawl ey rats, and cyno molgus monkeys after IV dosing. TAK -676 had high clearance in 
rats and moderate clearance in monkeys. The vo lume of distribut ion at steady  state after IV 
administration (V ss) of TAK -676 was moderate in rats and monkeys. TAK -676 showed little to no 
partitioning into red bl ood cells (RBCs). TAK -676 protein binding was low in mouse, dog, 
monkey, and human matrices and was moderate in rat plasma. TAK -676 had low clearance in 
hepatocy tes and was stable in serum isolated from mice, rats, dogs, monke ys, and humans. No 
unique human metabo lite was observed in the in vitro hepatocy tes and serum  incubat ions. 
TAK -676 was m ainly  eliminated as parent compound in bile duct –cannulated rats and monkeys, 
and the contribut ion of metabo lism to the clearance pathwa y in bile duct –cannulated monkeys was 
considered minimal. TAK -676 has l ow cellular permeabilit y in human colonic adenocarcino ma 
cells.
TAK -676 i s a substrate for organic anio n
-transporting polypept ide (OATP) 1B1, OATP1B3, and 
multidrug resistance associate d protein 2 but is not likely a substrate for P -glycoprotein and breast 
cancer resistance protein. While the OATP inhibit ors m ay affect pl asma drug l evels of TAK -676, 
the impact of OATP1B1 po lymo rphism on TAK -676 exposure is ant icipated to be low. 
Neverthe less, as a precautionary measure, concomitant use of clinical inhibitors of OATP1B1 and 
OATP1B3 should be avo ided before the first dose of study  drug(s) and during the study .
The drug- drug interaction (DDI) poten tial of TAK -676 with cytochrome P -450 (CYP) inhibitors 
or inducers is unlikely  because the contribut ion of metabo lism to the clearance pathway is 
anticipated to be minimal. The DDIs of TAK -676 as CYP or transporter inhibitors or inducers is 
unlikely  at the currently  predicted dose. TAK -676 was proj ected to have moderate plasma 
clearance (0.562 L/h/kg), moderate Vss (0.376 L/kg), and short plasma half -life (0.85 h) in 
humans based on the allo metri c scaling fro m mo nkeys. Addit ional details about the nonclinical 
pharmacokinet ics (PK) of TAK -676 can be f ound in the IB.
4.4.3 Nonclinical Toxicology
A battery  of nonclinical studies, including in vitro studies for off -target liabilit ies, genotoxicit y, 
cytokine rel ease in human who le blood, species selection, liver toxicit y, and phototoxi city; and in 
vivo studi es (up to 2 weeks in duration) in rats and monkeys (including safet y pharm acology 
endpo ints), have been co mpleted to assess the potent ial toxicologic profile of TAK -676. 
Sprague Dawl ey rats and cyno molgus monkeys were selected as relevant toxico logy species, as 
TAK -676 has been shown to activate the STING pathway in these species. IV bolus administration 
was selected for the toxico logy program , as it was considered the best opportunit y for observing 
potenti al toxicities, including cy tokine release syndrome (CR S) if i t were to occur. In addit ion, to 
proactively  evaluate any  potenti al for inject ion site findings, which may occur with longer 
exposures of TAK -676 at the inject ion site (ie, if infusio nal dosing was used in the clinical

CONFIDENTIALstudi es), an IV infusio n arm  was added to the GLP -compliant toxi city studi es at the highest doses 
tested in both rats (40 mg/kg; approximately  10-minute infusion) and monkeys (0.13 mg/kg; 
approximately  30-and 10 -minute infusio n in males and approximately 10 -minute infusio n in 
females) . On the basis of toxicit y occurring at a lower nominal dose, with corresponding lower 
systemic exposures in monkeys co mpared wit h rats, the monkey is considered more sensit ive than 
rat as a toxico logy species. Pivotal toxicit y studies in rats and mo nkeys (BIW administration for 
2-week duration; 5 total doses) were conducted in compliance wit h GLP Regulat ions for 
Nonclinical Laboratory  Studi es of  the Uni ted States (US) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 
Code of Federal Regulat ion (CFR), Ti tle 21, Part 58 (2 1CFR Part 58) and Organisat ion for 
Economic Cooperation and Development Principles of GLP, where applicable. Several studies 
were exploratory in nature and, although were not conducted in full co mpliance with all aspects of 
GLP regulat ions, are considered scient ifically reliable, as they fo llow standard work practices and 
standard operating procedures.
4.4.3.1 Summary of Nonclinical Toxicology 
TAK -676 was not m utagenic, cl astogenic, or phototoxic as evaluated in in vitro assays and has a 
low risk for off -target, central nervous system, cardiovascular, or hepatotoxic liabilit ies. Increases 
in  levels were observed in an in vitro human cy tokine rel ease assay  in whol e 
blood and suggest a potential TAK -
676–related ri sk for CRS and inflammatory -and 
immun e
-related toxi cities in humans.
4.4.3.2 Observed Toxicity in Rats
TAK -676 was well tol erated in 2 exploratory  single -dose studies in Sprague Dawley  rats at doses 
up to 33.6 mg/kg (IV bolus) and in an exploratory  intermittent repeat- dose toxicit y study  in rats 
(BIW for 4 doses or QW for 3 doses) at doses up to 4.1 mg/kg (IV bolus). In the GLP repeat -dose 
toxicity study  in rats, TAK -676 was administered IV BIW (5 total doses) at 10, 20, and 40 mg/kg 
via bolus (approximately  1-2minutes). In addition, IV infusio n arm s, where rats were 
administered either vehicle (50 mM citrate buffer, 0.5% sodium chloride in sterile water for 
inject ion) or TAK -676 at 40 m g/kg BIW (over approximately  10 minutes using an indwelling 
catheter), were also included to evaluate the potential for inject ion site findings, which may occur 
with longer exposures of TAK -676 at the inject ion site. The tol erabili ty of TAK -676 decreased 
with repeated administration, causing removal o f animals earlier at 40 mg/kg (slow bo lus and 
infusio n) on Days 4 thro ugh 11 (animals received 2 to 4 doses) and on Day 15 at 10 and 20 mg/kg 
(after the 5th dose). In dead and/or moribund animals, TAK -676–related decreases in body weight 
and weight gain were observed that correlated with decreases in food consumption and cli nical  
observat ions of feces changes (loose, soft, liquid, or muco id); other observed signs included 
evidence of poor grooming (y ellow and/or brown stained, ungroomed, or erected fur); weakness, 
decreased act ivity, hunched posture, prostrate and/or lateral recumbency; co ld to touch; 
generalized pale skin; bilateral pale eyeballs; and/or partially  closed eye(s). Clinical pathology  
evaluat ion reflected an acute phase response (increases in neutrophil counts, 
alpha
-2-macroglobulin, and triglycerides, and decrea ses in albumin and cholesterol). Addit ionally, 
decreases in lymphocy tes, l eukocy tes, pl atelets, and red cell counts, and

CONFIDENTIAL4.5.1 Rationale for the Selected Patient Population
This study  will enroll adult patients with histologically  confirmed advanced or m etastati c solid 
tumors who have received or been o ffered all established standard of care (SOC) treatm ent options 
for which they  are eligible and whose disease previously progressed while on CPIs in a prior line 
of therapy . This patient populat ion represents a tradit ional cohort for phase 1 studies containing a 
new regimen wit hout a well -defined, bio marker -driven or tumor -specific tar get. This pat ient 
popul ation often has the most favorable balance between patient risk and benefit for a phase 1 
study . During dose escalation, this study  will collect tum or tissue and bl ood sam ples to i dentify 
potenti al pharm acody namic bio markers to suppo rt future patient select ion or enrichment.
This tri al specifically  recrui ts pati ents who are refractory  to or have developed resistance to 
anti-PD-1/ant i-PD-L1 therapies. There is preclinical evidence that the addit ion of a STING agonist 
may reverse the mechanisms of resistance in tumors with prior exposure to anti -PD-1/anti -PD-L1 
therapi es. Addi tionally, m ouse m odels of TAK -676 combined wi th radiation demo nstrate an 
added benefit from this co mbination. Thus, while it is unknown whether the addit ion of ra diation 
therapy  to the com binat ion of ant i-PD-1 ant ibody  and TAK -676 will provi de meaningful  clinical 
benefit, thi s regimen represents a promising approach to addressing CPI recalcitrance. Tumor 
responses in this group of patients may provide early insight into the clinical benefit produced by  
the combination o f TAK -676 and pembro lizumab fo llowing radiat ion therapy  for pati ents in 
which CPI alone is not sufficient to drive or maint ain a sustained clinical response.
4.5.1.1 NSCLC
NSCLC is the leading cause of cancer mortalit y in the US wi th an estimated 140,000 patients 
dying of the disease this year, which is greater than the number of cancer mortalit ies from colon, 
breast, and prostate cancer combined (Siegel et al. 2019 ). The majorit y of NSCLC patients present 
with metastati c disease. Recent ly, immunotherapy  with or wi thout chem otherapy  (depending on 
PD-L1 expression) has beco me the proven preferred first or second -line systemic therapy in 
patients without actionable tumor driver mutations (Borghaei et al. 2019 ; Gandhi et al. 2018 ; Reck 
et al. 2019 ). Similarly, radiat ion therapy  plays an important role in the m anagement of advanced 
NSCLC, whether in early or late -stage disease . Unfortunately, despite the overall success of ICB, 
the vast majorit y of patients eventually develop resistance to immunotherapy and have disease 
progression.
4.5.1.2 TNBC
TNBC represents up to 20% of all breast cancers and is defined by a lack of estrogen and 
progesterone receptor expressio n and the absence of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 
overexpressio n and/or amplificat ion (Foulkes et al . 2010 ). The lack of hormone expressio n 
precl udes the use of endocrine therapy , the backbone of treatment in metastatic hormone 
receptor -positive breast cancer. Thus, chemotherapy is the traditional mainstay  of treatm ent in 
meta static TNBC, with short -lived responses and limited prognosis in this patient populat ion (Li et 
al. 2017 ). There has thus been much excitement about the potential use of ICB in TNBC (Adams et 
al. 2019a ). Init ial studi es have sh own obj ective response rates, many wit h durabilit y, with ICB 
monotherapy  of up to 23% in first -line pat ients with PD -L1 posit ive tumors (Adams et al. 2019b ).

CONFIDENTIALNotably, the IMPASSION 130 phase 3 trial evaluated nab -pacli taxel  +/-atezolizumab in 902 
previously untreated metastatic TNBC and showed improved progression -free survival (PFS) of 
7.2 m onths in the atezolizumab arm co mpared with 5.5 months in the placebo arm  (p<0.002); 
median overall survival was 21.3 months in the atezolizumab arm versus 17.6 months wit h 
placebo (p =0.08), and an even greater benefit was seen in the PD -L1-posit ive populat ion (Schmid 
et al. 2018 ). Although this study init ially received accelerated approval for first -line use in pat ients 
with metastati c TNBC and posit ive PD -L1 expressio n levels, thi s approval has since been 
withdrawn ,further highlight ing the challenges in treating this type o f breast cancer. In contrast, 
recent results fro m the phase 3 Keynote -355 tri al showed a si gnificant increase in PFS (9.7 vs 5.6 
months; p = 0.0012) for patients with metastatic TNBC and a co mbined pos itive score ≥10 who 
were treated with pembro lizumab plus chemotherapy  (nab -pacli taxel, pacli taxel , or 
carbopl atin/gemcitabine) versus chemotherapy alo ne. On the basis of this study , pembrolizumab 
in co mbinat ion with chemotherapy for the treatm ent of patien ts with locally recurrent unresectable 
or metastati c TNBC whose tumors express PD -L1 (CPS ≥10) has been granted accelerated 
approval . Currently, once a patient progresses on either atezolizumab plus nab -pacli taxel or 
pembro lizumab plus chemotherapy, they m ay have the opti on of  being treated i n a later line with 
the ant ibody  drug conjugate, sacituzumab govitecan, but beyo nd this, the treatment options remain 
limited.
4.5.1.3 SCCHN
In 2020, an estimated 53,260 new cancers o f the oral cavit y and pharynx are expected to be 
diagnosed, and 10,750 people will die o f the disease. Key  risk factors for SCCHN are smoking, 
alcoho l consumpt ion, human papillo mavirus, and Epstein -Barr virus. Only  29% of  patients are 
diagnosed wi th localized disease that i s curable by surgery  alone. SCCHN has a predominant ly 
locoregi onal pattern of recurrence, with only 25% of patients presenting wit h distant metastases at 
recurrence, and this mostly to the lungs. Chemoradiat ion therapy  plays a cornerstone role in the 
treatm ent of l ocally advanced S CCHN both in a first -line definit ive or postoperative setting 
(National  Com prehensive Cancer Network 2020 ; Quon et al. 2017 ; Sher et al . 2017 ). More 
recent ly, pembrolizumab was FDA -approved in the first -line setting for the treatm ent of metastatic 
or unresectable SCCHN as mo notherapy  for pati ents wi th posi tive PD -L1 expression and in 
combinat ion with platinum and fluorouracil in pat ients whose tumors are PD- L1 negative. 
Nivo lumab is also approved for use in the second -line setting after progression on a 
platinum -containing agen t. Although the rol e of pembrolizumab combined wit h radi ation therapy  
is current ly being studied (Yu and Lee 2019 ), there is an unmet clinical need for those patients who 
have progressive disease (PD) while on CPI and chemotherapy.
4.5.2 Rationale for Dose of Radiation Therapy
As noted in Section 4.2, multiple studi es have evaluated the com binat ion of radiat ion therapy  and 
CPIs in me tastatic so lid malignancies. Dosing regimens in these studies have ranged fro m 20 to 60 
Gy given over 3 to 5 fractions. The ORRs seen in nonirradiated lesions (abscopal effect) in these 
studi es is generally modest, with rates ranging fro m 8% to 45%. Only t wo of these studies included 
rando mized controls (McBride et al. 2018 ; Theelen et al. 2019 ), and neither of these studies 
showed stati stically significant differences in response rates between the CPI m onotherapy  and

CONFIDENTIALcombined CPI plus stereotactic radiat ion cohorts. Consequent ly, it is impossible to definit ively 
state a radi ation dose and schedule that is optimally  immunogenic in this setting. Nonetheless, 
three of the most promising trials fro m Table 4.autilized a commo n radi ation therapy  regimen 
with 24 Gy given over 3 equal fractions, either concomitant ly with CPI (pembro lizumab (Sundahl 
et al. 2019b )or nivo lumab (
Sundahl et al. 2019a) ) or precedin g CPI (pembrolizumab (Theelen et 
al. 2019 )). Two studies by Sundahl et al. evaluated the concomitant use of stereotactic body  
radiation therapy  (SBRT) of 8 Gy  × 3 wi th either pembro lizumab or nivo lumab (RT given before 
the second cy cle of CPI) in bladder cancer and melano ma, respect ively (Sundahl  et al . 2019a ; 
Sundahl et al. 2019b) . Although small, each of these trials showed an ORR in the nonirradiated 
lesions of  approximately 45%. Addit ionally, the rando mized phase 2 PEMBRO -RT tri al noted 
above evaluated SBRT at 8 Gy  × 3 fo llowed by pembrolizumab in advanced NSCLC. While the 
resul ts of this study  did not reach stati stical significance, there was an observed improvement in 
ORR in nonirradiated lesio ns(36% vs 18%, p =0.07), median PFS (6.6 vs 1.9 months, p =0.19), 
and mOS (15.9 vs 7.6 months, p =0.16), suggesting the need for further explorat ion of this 
approach. These results, as well as the tolerable safety  profile seen in these and other studies 
utilizing SBRT at 8 Gy × 3 doses ( Table 4.b) (Maity et al. 2018 ; McBride et al. 2018 ; Voorwerk et 
al. 2019 ), support the use of this dosing schedule as a safe and adequately  immunogenic regimen.
Addit ionally, recent preclinical data appear to favor fract ionated radiotherapy  (8 Gy  × 3) over 
20Gy ×1 due to the abilit y of the 8 Gy  ×3 regimen to generate a level o f cytosolic DNA which 
activates cGAS and STING, resul ting in upregulation of the ty pe I IFN pathway  and consequent 
activat ion of ant igen-present ing DCs in the tumor. In contrast, the 20 Gy ×1 regimen upregulates 
the exonuclease Trex1, leading to cy tosolic DNA degradation and prevent ing the activat ion of 
cGAS and i ts downstream  effects (Vanpouille -Box et al . 2017 ).
4.5.3 Rationale for Proposed Starting Dose of TAK -676
To appropriately balance the potential risk of developing acute adverse events (AEs) fro m immune 
stimulat ion in the cance r pati ent popul ation and the potential for pharmaco logic act ivity at the 
starting dose, the maximum reco mmended starting dose (MRSD) from the GLP -compliant 2- week 
repeat -dose monkey toxicit y study  (most sensi tive species) and the minimum ant icipated 
biological effect l evel (MABEL) were consi dered in select ing the starting dose of TAK -676. 
Please refer to the IB for addit ional details.
The dose of 0.2 mg TAK -676 corresponds to the MABEL. Furthermore, the dose of 0.06 mg/kg 
was considered both the HNSTD and N OAEL in the GLP -compliant 2 -week toxicit y study  in 
cyno molgus monkeys. Using this dose, the estimated MRSD in humans was 0.19 mg. This 
estimat ion was based both on body  surface area and AUC calculat ions and includes the 1/6th 
safet y factor calculat ion per ICH S9 and i s quasi -concordant with the MABEL-based dose 
calculat ion.
4.5.3.1 Dose Range
The proposed dose range for TAK -676 in the dose escalat ion phase of the study  is 0.2 to 9.0 mg 
administered on Days 1, 8, and 15 of every 21 -day cy cle.

infusio n once weekly  alone or in combinat ion with pembrolizumab, will provide init ial clinical 
data on the safet y and tol erabili ty of TAK -676 + pembrolizumab. In the combination arm o f the 
FIH study, TAK -676 is administered in a dose -escalat ing fashio n (starting at 0.2 mg IV on Days 1, 
8, and 15 of a 21
-day cycle) al ong wi th pembrolizum ab at the fixed dose of 200 mg IV every  3 
weeks. Safet y data was to be obtained fro m at least 2 dose cohort s of the FIH combination arm 
before administering TAK -676 with pembro lizumab fo llowing radiat ion therapy in this study. The 
dose escalat ion phase of the TAK -676-1002 FIH study  is ongoing and no dose-limit ing toxicit ies 
(DLTs )or preliminary safet y/tolerabilit y concerns were observed at the preplanned interim safet y 
data review at 1.2 mg TAK -676 or through 0.8 mg TAK -676 in combinat ion with pembro lizumab, 
confirming that it is safe to proceed with enrollment in this study  at th e proposed starting dose 
level. Dose escalat ion in the FIH study  is ongoing at higher dose levels, and t he highest proposed 
dose in this study  will not exceed the hi ghest dose level determined to be safe in the FIH study .
4.5.4 Rationale for Paired Biopsies and Blood Draws
Tumor and bl ood ti ssues will be collected to assess changes over time in the tumor and the innate 
and adapt ive immune response fo llowing treatment with radiat ion, pembrolizumab, and TAK -
676.
4.5.4.1 Tumor Biopsies
Tumor biopsies of nonirradiated tumorsat baseline and on -treatm ent will be collected to determine 
modulat ion of the innate and adaptive immune response in the TME, including evaluat ion of T cell 
diversit y. These samples m ay also be evaluated for tumor mutational burden and to determine 
treatm ent effects in cancer cells and immune cells.
Induct ion of an innate and/or adaptive immune response in the tumor will be assessed by 
measuring levels of mRNA and protein using RNA sequencing and slide -based assays for 
evaluat ion of levels o f tumor infiltr ating lymphocytes and activat ion states of innate and adapt ive 
immune cell subsets. Addit ional analyses related to resistance, response or disease 
characterizat ion may be done on collected biopsies.
To minimize the risk of performing invasive procedures on patients at TAK -676 dose l evels wit h 
no measurable pharmacodynamic act ivity, paired biopsies of nonirradiated tumors will be required 
only for pati ents on dose l evels o f TAK -676 that have demo nstrated evidence of 
pharmacodynamic act ivity in peri pheral bl ood (refer Section 9.4.15.1 ). Addit ionally , once the 
tumor biopsies are m andated, safely accessible paired biopsies will be co llected fro m all pat ients 
during dose escalat ion and addit ional pat ients are expected to be added if an expansio n phase i s 
supported ,to achi eve a greater than 0.8 predicted posterior probabilit y of increased immune 
infiltrat ion within the tum or (refer to Appendix K). However, pai red bi opsies are highly  desired 
and strongly  encouraged in all pat ients, regardless of dose level, if the lesions are deemed safely 
accessible. The specific anatomical location of the biopsy before resection must be specified.

CONFIDENTIAL4.5.4.2 Blood
Blood sam ples will be collected to demonstrate STING pathway  activati on and act ivation of an 
innate and/or adaptive immune response. This will be assessed by measuring levels of select 
plasma chemokines and cy tokines (eg, IP -10), detection of a STING agonism/t ype I IFN gene 
signature, changes in the number, percentage, or activat ion state of immune cell subsets in the 
blood, and changes in T cell clo nality.
4.5.5 Rationale for PK Assessments
Serial plasma PK of TAK -676 will be assessed. The PK data collected on these occasions will 
coincide wit h phar macodynamic assessments. PK data in conjunct ion with pharmacodynamic data 
can help in the understanding of the PK -pharm acodynamic relationship of TAK -676. Such data 
may also be useful in building mathematical models to describe the PK -pharm acodynamic and/or 
PK-safet y/efficacy relat ionship of TAK -676 that can eventually be used to predict the time course 
of PK and pharmacodynamic effects of TAK -676. This informat ion may also help provide context 
for safet y findings from the study  and can be helpful in selecting the recommended phase 2 dose 
(RP2D) and schedule for TAK -676.
4.6 Potential Risks and Benefits
The potential effects listed below are based on pub licly available data on the effects of radiat ion as 
well as other clinical studies that have evaluated radiat ion in combinat ion with pembro lizumab. 
The potential risks associated with TAK -676 administration are reviewed below and in further 
detail in the I B. 
4.6.1 Potential Risks and Effects of Radiation in Combination with Pembrolizumab
Multiple clinical studi es have reported on the safety  of the combinat ion of radiation therapy  and 
pembro lizumab ( Table 4.b). Overall, the combinat ion was found to be safe wit h AEs similar to 
those commo nly associated wi th pembro lizumab. Most of the observed AEs were of Grade 1 and 
2, including dermat itis reported in 29% of patients in 1 study. AEs of Grade 3 in severit y were 
reported infrequently, including fatigue, lymphopenia, infect ion, pneumo nitis, infusio n-related 
reacti on and wei ght loss. Rare Grade 4 AEs were observed, including Grade 4 adrenal 
insufficiency in 1 study .
An increased rate of radiat ion necrosis in pat ients with brain metastases from melanoma who 
received stereotactic radiosurgery  (SRS) and CPI was reported. No reports of radiat ion necrosis 
were noted in pat ients with NSCLC, TNBC, or SCCHN recei ving radiat ion therapy  in 
combinat ion with pembrolizumab or other CPIs. In 1 study  evaluat ing pembro lizumab and 
multisite stereotactic body  radiotherapy  in 79 pati ents wi th advanced so lid tumors, toxicit y was 
generally low; however, when toxicit y was obser ved, i t appeared to be in the region that was 
irradi ated, which m ade i t difficul t to di stinguish between toxicit y of combinat ion therapy  versus 
radiation alone (Luke et al. 2018) . A retrospective review of 133 patients treated with palliat ive 
radiotherapy  and anti –PD-1 showed a 4% Grade 3 or higher immune -related AE rate, and toxicit y 
was not related to anatomic locat ion of R T (Bang et al. 2017 ). Addi tional pote ntia

To minimize the risk of coagulopathy , pati ents treated wi th TAK -676 will have their coagulation 
funct ion monitored according to the study  evaluat ion schedule and on an ad hoc basis as needed.
4.6.3 Potential Risks and Effects Seen With Other STING Ag onists
Addit ional risks have been reported with other STING agonists and are described below. Alt hough 
these ri sks were not observed in TAK -676 animal studies, they  shoul d be carefully  monitored.
There were no relevant findings from nonclinical toxico logy studi es indicat ing a potential for 
skin-related toxi cities. Skin rashes are commo nly associ ated wi th activat ion of t ype I IFN. 
Patients wi th congeni tal STING activat ing mutations (STING -associ ated vasculopathy wit h 
onset in infancy -like disorder) have skin lesions, incl uding telangiectati c lesions on nose and 
cheeks and vio laceous, scaling atrophic plaques on hands, and vascular inflammat ion in skin 
biopsy.
No cardi ovascular liabilit ies were i dentified for TAK -676 based on in vitro results from a 
hERG or hu man stem  cell–cardi omyocyte calcium transient proarrhy thmia assay . In addi tion, 
there were no changes in qualitat
ive ECG parameters or heart rate in evaluated monkeys 
following repeated administration of TAK -676 at doses up to 0.13 mg/kg. However, literatu re 
data indicate that CDNs can impact hyperpo larization-activated cyclic nucleotide -modulated 
channels that regulate the rhy thmic firing of neurons and cardiac my ocytes; thus, potenti ally 
affect ing cardiac repo larization (Lolicato et al. 2014 ).
4.6.4 Potential Risks and Effects of TAK -676 in Combination With Pembrolizumab
Nonclinical toxico logy studi es evaluat ing the combinat ion of TAK -676 and pembrolizumab were 
not conducted and are not warranted per ICH S9. Pembro lizumab is a monoclonal ant ibody  that 
binds to the human PD -1 receptor and blocks the interaction of PD -1 with PD-L1/PD -L2. 
TAK -676 at 0.25, 0.5, or 1 mg/kg was administered to tumor-bearing mice Q3D (Days 2, 5, and 9) 
alone or in combinat ion with 10 m g/kg ant i-mouse PD -1 antibody (Q3D×3 fo llowed by  QW×3). 
Com pared wi th treatm ent wi th TAK -676 al one, synergist ic toxicit y, as assessed by increased 
mortalit y or m ore si gnificant decreases in body  weigh t was not observed in mouse tumor -bearing 
models administered TAK -676 in co mbinat ion with an ant i-mouse PD -1 ant ibody . TAK -676 and 
pembro lizumab both activate the immune system, so known PD -1 immunotherapy -related 
toxicities (such as pneumo nitis, colit is, hepat itis, dermat itis, infusio n-related reacti ons, 
endocrinopathies, and nephrit is) observed fo llowing the administration of pembro lizumab may be 
enhanced when combined wit h TAK -676. Details regarding the full safet y profile of

Pembrolizumab
Radiation -related AEs (including inflammatory  reacti ons, infect ions and abscess within the 
radiation field) may occur or be en hanced when radiat ion is combined wit h TAK -676 and 
pembro lizumab.
Nonclinical toxico logy studi es evaluat ing the combinat ion of TAK -676 and radi ation were not

Nonclinical Pharmacology Studies of Antitumor Activit y of TAK -676 in Combination With 
Radiation in Syngeneic Mouse Models:
Tolerabilit y, as assessed by enhanced mortalit y and BWL, was monitored in pharmaco logy studies 
in tum or-bearing mouse models where focal radiatio n was administered in co mbinat ion with 
TAK-676, with or without an ant i-PD-1 antibody. A regimen of 10 Gy × 1 radiation was delivered 
with the RS 2000 Small Animal Irradiator using a lead box to provide shielding, with a small ho le 
to provi de access to the tum or. A regimen o f 8 Gy  × 3 radi ation was delivered with the SARRP 
(Small Animal Radiat ion Research Platform) with 3D volumetric image guidance for target 
localizat ion and dose delivery , which minimizes exposure to nontargeted tissues and organs and 
allows higher total doses of radiat ion to be delivered to the tumor.
Tolerabilit y of TAK -676 at 1 m g/kg in combinat ion with a single fract ion of 10 Gy  was 
assessed in 2 pharmaco logy studi es in the EMT6 mouse breast cancer model and in 1 study in 
the A20 m ouse lymphom a model.
–In 1 study , TAK -676 at 1 mg/kg was administered to EMT6 tumor -bearing mice on a 
Q3D×3 schedule (Days 2, 5, and 8) alone or in combinat ion with 10 Gy radiat ion on 1 of 5 
different day s (Day  0, 1, 2, 3, or 4). A radiat ion alo ne arm, where 10 Gy  radiation was 
given once on Day  2 was also included. All groups contained 10 mice each. Transient 
BWL was observed in all groups. Maximum mean BWL in single agent groups was 4.1% 
and 2.3% for TAK -676 and radiation respectively, while maximum mean BWL in the 
5combination groups ranged from 7.0 % to 10.1%. BWL resulted in the removal o f 2 of 
50mice receiving TAK -676 in co mbinat ion with 10 Gy  radiation. These mice, which 
received TAK -676 + 10 Gy  radiation on Day  4, were rem oved from  the study  on Days 11 
and 33.
–In another study , TAK -676 at 1 m g/kg was administered to EMT6 tumor -bearing mice 
Q3D×3 (Day s 2, 5, and 8) alone or in co mbination with 10 Gy radiat ion on 1 of 3 different 
days (Day 0, 2, or 4). Radiat ion alone arms, where 10 Gy radiat ion was given once on Da y 
0, 2, or 4 were also included. All groups con tained 10 mice each. Transient BWL was 
observed in all treatment groups but was considered tolerable as mean BWL was <11% in 
all groups and no mice met criteria for removal from study  due to BWL. Maximum mean 
BWL in single agent groups was 1. 7% and 0.9% to 5.2% for TAK -676 and radiat ion 
groups respectively, while maximum mean BWL in the 3 combinat ion groups ranged fro m 
9.4% to 11%.

Q3D×3 (Day s 2, 5, and 8) alone or in combination with 10 Gy radiat ion on 1 of 3 different 
days (Day 0, 2, or 4). Radiat ion alone arms, where 10 Gy radiat ion was given once on Da y 
0, 2, or 4 were also included. Transient BWL was observed in all groups which received 
TAK -676 or radi ation as si ngle agents or i n combinat ion. Maximum mean BWL in single 
agent groups was 4.9%, 8%, 9.7%, and 9.3% for TAK -676, Day  0 radi ation, Day  2 
radiation, and Day 4 radiation respect ively. BWL in these single -agent groups resulted in 
the rem oval of  1 mouse (of 10) on Day  11 that received 10 Gy  radiat ion on Day  4. In 
combinat ion groups, BWL was addit ive, result ing in a maximum  mean BWL of 14.3%, 
13.6%, and 15.6% for TAK -676 + radiat ion on Day 0, 2, or 4, respectively. In combinat ion 
groups, BWL resulted in the early removal of 5 of 10 mice (on Day s 4 and 7) wi th 
TAK -676 + 10 Gy radiat ion administered on Day 0, 1 of 10 mice (on Day 9) with TAK -676 
+ 10 Gy  radiati on administered on Day 2, and 3 of 10 mice (on Day s 7 and 9) wi th 
TAK -676 + 10 Gy  radiati on administered on Day 4.
Tolerabilit y of TAK -676 in co mbinat ion with 8 Gy × 3 wi th or wi thout anti -PD-1 ant ibody  
treatm ent was assessed in a study  in EMT6 tum or-bearing mice. In this study , radiati on was 
administered once daily for 3 consecut ive days, fo llowed 48 hours lat er by  TAK -676 dosed at 
0.25 or 1 mg/kg on a Q3D×3 schedule, alo ng with an ant i-PD-1 ant ibody dosed Q3D×3 on the 
same days as TAK -676. The regimen of 8 Gy  × 3 followed 48 hours later by  TAK -676 at 1 
mg/kg was also evaluated with an isoty pe control  antibody  instead of an ant i-PD-1 ant ibody . 
For com parison, the study  included groups to test single agent effects of 8 Gy  × 3 radi ation, 
anti-PD-1 ant ibody , and TAK -676 at 0.25 m g/kg and 1 m g/kg, and a group which received 
8Gy × 3 radi ation followed by  anti-PD-1 antibody. All groups contained 8 mice each. 
Transient BWL was observed in all treatment groups. Maximum mean BWL in single -agent 
groups was 3.7%, 1.6%, 7.8%, and 0.2% for radiatio n, 0.25 mg/kg TAK -676, 1 mg/kg 
TAK -676, and ant i-PD-1 groups, respectively. Ma ximum mean BWL in the group which 
received radiation and ant i-PD-1 was 3.8%. In the groups that received 8 Gy × 3 fo llowed by 
TAK -676 at 1 m g/kg, wi th anti-PD-1 or i sotype control , the m aximum  mean BWL was 9.0% 
and 9.9%, respectively. Maximum mean BWL of t he group receiving 8 Gy  × 3 wi th 
0.25 mg/kg TAK -676 and ant i-PD-1 was 1.8%. The combinat ion was considered tolerable as 
no mice were removed for BWL during the study .
Taken together, these results indicate that in EMT6 tumor -bearing mice, TAK -676 at 1 mg/k g was 
well tolerated in combinat ion with 8 Gy × 3 radiat ion delivered through an advanced image -guided 
system  to minimize norm al tissue radi ation exposure. BWL was <10% and no treatment -related 
mortalit y was observed. The addit ion of an ant i-PD-1 antibody  to thi s regimen did not result in 
additional BW L or m ortali ty. In EMT6 mice, TAK -676 at 1 mg/kg was also generally well 
tolerated in co mbinat ion with 10 Gy  × 1 radi ation delivered without image guidance, with 7% to 
11% m aximal mean BWL in 8 combinat ion gro ups (n =80 mice total), with the except ion of the 
removal of 2 mice due to BWL. In contrast, A20 tumor -bearing mice treated with TAK -676 at 1 
mg/kg and 10 Gy  × 1 radiat ion did not tol erate the regimen, experiencing more BWL than seen in

AEs will be assessed, and laboratory  values, vital signs, ECGs, and other clinically  indicated 
examinat ions will be obtained to evaluate the safety and tolerabilit y of the study  drugs in 
combinat ion with radiati on. Toxi city will be evaluated according to NCI CTCAE, Version 5.0. 
DLTs are defined in Section
 8.2. A DLT will be defined as any  of the treatm ent-emergent AEs 
(TEAEs) described in the safet y eva luation section that occur during Cycle 1 and are considered by 
the invest igator to be at least possibly related to TAK -676 in co mbinat ion with pembro lizumab

determinat ion of RP2D of TAK - 676.
Radiological evaluat ions (CT scan and/or magnet ic resonance imaging [MRI] as clinically 
indicated) will be emplo yed to assess the status of the patient’s underlying disease. Before
radiation therapy , the radi ology oncol ogist and m edical oncol ogist shoul d agree on the target 
lesions i dentified for irradiation using the baseline imaging assessments . Banked formalin fixed 
paraffin -embedded tumor tissue or a minimum number of unstained slides of the tumor tissue will 
be co llecte d, if available, fro m all enrolled pat ients to assess baseline features such as gene 
mutati ons, gene signatures, tumor mutation burden, immune cell content, or bio markers of 
response or resistance to treatment that may emerge fro m future nonclinical or cli nical  studies. All 
patients wi th a safely accessible lesion outside the radiat ion field and in who m a fresh tum or 
biopsy enrolling at dose levels of TAK -676 which have been shown to have pharmacodynamic 
activit y will have mandatory  tumor biopsy  performed a s per Schedule of Events (SOE)

Serial blood sam ples will  be collected for ci rculating bio markers (peripheral proteins, cy tokines, 
and chemo kines, incl uding IP -10, an IFN -inducible chemokine), immunophenotyping, mRNA 
expressio n, receptor sequencing, and cell -free DNA. An evaluat ion of disease response will be

All patients will attend an end of treatment (EOT) visit 30 days (+10 days) after receiving their la st 
dose of study drug or before the start of subsequent systemic ant icancer therapy, whichever occurs 
first, to permi t detecti on of  any delayed TEAEs and to resolve any  ongoing events. If a patient is 
not able to return for the EOT visit, the EOT assessmen ts may be perform ed at the time of 
treatm ent discont inuat ion following discussio n wit h the sponsor. Patients with unreso lved TEAEs 
will cont inue the periodic safet y follow-up unt il complete resol ution or stabilizati on (established

treatm ent for reasons other than PD will cont inue follow -up every 12 ±1 weeks fro m the EOT visit  
until the occurrence of PD, loss to fo llow-up, consent withdrawal, the start of subsequent systemic 
antineoplastic therapy, study terminat ion, or death, whichever occurs first (Section 9.8).
6.3.2 End of Study/Study Completion Definition and Plann ed Reporting
The ant icipated duration of this study will be approximately 30 mo nths (from first patient first visit  
to last pati ent last visit) . The final data cutoff for the CSR will be conducted after all patients have 
been discont inued fro m treatm ent or transferred to a long- term safet y study  or a similar program 
(Secti on 6.3.5 ).
Patients previously discont inued from study treatment will undergo the EOT visit but will cont inue 
to be fo llowed every  12 ±1 weeks fro m the EOT visit as described in Sect ion 9.8.

under the supervisio n of the invest igator or ident ified subinvestigator(s).
Invest igational medicinal product(s): radiat ion therapy , pembrolizumab, TAK -676.
8.1 Study Drug Administration
8.1.1 Radiation Treatment Regimen 
Before radiat ion therapy , the radi ology oncol ogist and medical oncologist should agree on the 
target lesio ns ident ified for irradiat ion using of the baseline imaging assessments .
Radiation therapy  with daily  image guidance will be administered using a fractionated dose of 
8Gy × 3.
All pat ients will receive radiation therapy and pembro lizumab in addit ion to an escalat ing dose of
TAK -676.
The radi ation must be administered between Day -8 and Day -2with a minimum  of 40 hours 
between the last fract ion of radiat ion and init iation of IV pembro lizumab and TAK -676. At least 1 
and up to 3 lesio ns may be radiated, if indicated for pallia tive reasons. If the init ial planned dose of 
8 Gy  × 3 results in intolerable local AEs when given in co mbinat ion with TAK -676 and 
pembro lizumab, the radiat ion dose m ay be reduced to 8 Gy  × 1 in subsequent cohorts.
The radi ation treatment and planning proce ss will proceed as follows:
1.Immobilizat ion.
a)Patients will  be posi tioned in a stable and comfortable posit ion, allowing accurate 
reproducibilit y of the target posit ion from treatment to treatment.
b)A variety  of immo bilizat ion systems may be used, including s tereotacti c frames, 
patient-customized rigid pillo ws, and thermoplast ic masks.
2.Radiation CT simulat ion.
a)The treatment planning process will include CT based simulat ion with axial imaging ever y 
1 to 3 mm to cover the area(s) of interest.
b)IV and/or oral cont rast during the planning CT is optional.

CONFIDENTIAL3.Internal mot ion management.
a)Internal tumor and organ motion (eg, due to breathing) must be accounted for during the 
simulat ion and pl anning process.
b)For targets (eg, lung, liver, adrenal and thoracic/upper abdominal lymph node targets) that 
have significant motion, 4D -CT planning is mandatory .
c)Acceptable motion management includes reliable abdo minal compressi on, linear 
accelerator beam gating wit h the respiratory  cycle, tum or tracking, and act ive 
breath -holding techniques.
4.Daily target localizat ion.
a)Image-guided radi ation therapy  is mandatory .
b)Contours: Tumor contours will be defined by the physician and radiation onco logy staff:
i.Gross tum or vol ume (GTV): This is the target gross tumor as defined by the treating 
radiation oncol ogist wi th the help of positron emission tomography , MRI, and 
diagnosti c CT wi th contrast as appropriate.
ii.Internal target volume (ITV): Delineat ion of an ITV is mandated when a 4D -CT is 
requi red.
iii.Clinical tum or vol ume (CTV): An optional 0 -to 1-cm margin on GTV is allowed 
when determining the CTVs at the treating radiation onco logist’s discret ion to 
account for any  uncertaint y or microscopi c disease. This margin may  be expanded 
based on clinical judgment with permissio n of the principal investigat or.
iv.Planning tumor vo lume (PTV): A 3 to 5 mm PTV margin will be uniformly added to 
the CTV and will also be included to account for set -up variat ion, as appropriate to 
each individual lesio n.
v.Organs at risk (OARs): For the 8 Gy × 3 dose level, several cont ours of the OAR will 
be defined by the physician and/or treatment planner if visible wit hin the axial slices 
within 2 cm  of the PTV as per inst itutional guidelines and indicated in Table 8.aor 
unless noted below:
Spinal cord: In cases where the PTV overlaps the vertebral column and the dose 
fractionation is greater than 8 Gy  × 1, the spinal cord will be delineated with the 
aid of interventi onal radi ology myel ogram  or fused MRI. Otherwi se, the spinal 
cord will be contoured based on the bony limits o f the spinal canal. The spinal 
cord shoul d be contoured starting at least 5 cm above the superior extent of the 
PTV and continuing on every CT slice to at lea st 5 cm below the inferior extent of 
the PTV.
Heart/peri cardium : The heart will be contoured along with the pericardial sac. 
The superior aspect will begin at the level o f the inferior aspect of the pulmo nary 
artery  passing the midline and extend inferiorl y to the apex of the heart.

TAK -676 infusio n will start 1 hour (+15 minutes) after the end o f pembrolizumab infusion on Day 
1 of each cycle.
TAK -676 will be provided as a solut ion containing 3 mg/3 mL TAK -676 drug substance as free 
base. TAK -676 inject ion 3 m g/3 m L as free base solut ion needs to be diluted for in fusion at the 
clinical site (refer to the Pharmacy Manual).
TAK -676 will be administered IV on a dosing schedule of Days 1, 8, and 15 of a 21 -day cycle. 
Alternate dosing schedules of administration in combinat ion with pembro lizumab may also be 
considered d uring dose escalat ion if the collective data including safety, PK, and 
pharmacodynamics support it, without requiring a protocol amendment.
Administrati on shoul d always be perform ed on schedul e; however, if extenuat ing circumstances 
prevent a patient from beginning treatment on a particular dosing day, a -1/+2
-day window will be 
allowable for all cycles except for Cycle 1. During subsequent cycles, if the Day 1 dose schedule is 
altered, i t is preferred to also shift the Day 8 and Day 15 doses and maintain a 21-day cycle. If the 
Day 8 or Day  15 dose scheduled is altered, it is preferred to return to the original schedule for the 
subsequent dose. If a patient misses a dose outside of this window, that dose will be considered 
missed and dosing will resume at th e next scheduled dosing timepo int. Based on emerging data 
(eg, severit y of infusi on-related reacti ons), infusio n time may  be adj usted to l ess than or greater 
than 60 minutes upon agreement with the sponsor and invest igators. The infusio n may be slowed 
or stopped and restarted for any  infusi on-related reacti ons. All infusio n times must be recorded. 
Prem edicat ion for infusio n is no t recommended init ially, but also may be added based on emerging 
data and upon agreement with the sponsor and investigators.
For a dministrations of TAK -676, vi tal signs will  be m easured immediately  before the start of the 
infusio n (within 30 minutes), 30 minutes after start of infusio n (±5 minutes), at the end of infusio n 
(±10 minutes), 2 hours post infusio n (±30 minutes), any t ime w hen clinically indicated, and before 
discharge (if different from and not overlapping with the timepo ints above). Vital signs should be 
measured and recorded at any  time if the patient develops symptoms associated with potential 
risks o f TAK -676 and/or pem brolizumab. The frequency and timing of vital sign mo nitoring may  
be modified based on emerging data and agreement between sponsor and investigators.

8.3 Dose Escalation Rules 
Dose escalat ion of TAK -676 will fo llow BOIN design to inform dose escalation decisio ns and 
potenti al MTD estimat ion. Three patients will be enro lled in the init ial cohort at the previously 
ident ified starting dos e level of TAK -676. Subsequent cohorts will enroll 2 to 3 patients per the 
escalat ion/de-escalati on guidelines outlined in Table 6.a. The target toxicit yrate is ϕ= 0.3. It is 
generally expected that at least 3 patients will enroll per cohort. However, if no DLTs have been 
ident ified in the TAK -676 + pembrolizumab dose level that has already been evaluated in the 
dose-finding phase 1 TAK -676- 1002 study , the sponsor, in agreement with the TAK - 676-1003 
investigators, may  opt to enroll  a 2-patient cohort at that same [radiation] + TAK -676 + 
pembro lizumab dose level being evaluated in the TAK -
676-1003 study . To gui de dose escalat ion 
decisio ns, if the observed DLT rate at the current dose is ≤0.236, the next cohort of patients will be 
treated at the next higher dose level; if it is ≥ 0.358, the next cohort of patients will be treated at the 
next lower dose level; if it is wit hin 0.236 and 0.358, addit ional patie nts will be enrolled in this 
dose l evel. For the purpose of overdose control, dose j and higher levels will be eliminated from 
further examinat ion if Pr(p j>0.3 | data) >0.95, where p jis the true DLT rate of dose level j. When

be considered to inform subsequent dose recommendat ions, dose escalation decisio ns, and 
potenti al MTD/RP2D est imation.
8.4 Dose Modification Guidelines
Decisio ns regarding which study  drug requi res dose m odificat ion will be dependent upon the 
toxicity, its onset, and i ts time course. The causal relat ionship o f any reported events (AEs or 
SAEs) should be assessed by the invest igator in relation to radiat ion, TAK -676, and 
pembro
lizumab. After discussio n between the investigator and the sponsor, alternat ive dose 
modificati ons m ay be reco mmended to maximize exposure of study treatment while protecting 
patient safet y. Discussio ns and agreements will be documented.
General Principles
Treatment with TAK- 676 in co mbination wit h pembrolizumab fo llowing radiat ion therapy  will 
occur i n 21-day cycles. Toxi cities are to be assessed according to the NCI CTCAE, Version 5.0. 
All toxicit ies that occur during the study  will be actively  managed foll owing the SOC unless 
otherwi se specified in the protocol. The causal relationship of any reported eve nts (AEs or SAEs) 
shoul d be assessed by the invest igator in relat ion to radiat ion therapy , pembrolizumab, and/or 
TAK -676. Pati ents experiencing AEs attributed to TAK -676 in combinat ion with pembro lizuma b 
may cont inue study  treatm ent and m aintain the same d ose, have doses held, have doses of 
TAK -676 reduced, or permanent ly discont inue from the study . Pati ents who have the TAK -676 
dose held due to a treatm ent-related or possibly related AE may resume study drug after reso lution 
of the AE, and m ay ei ther maintain the same dose level or have doses of TAK -676 reduced after 
consultation with the sponsor. When a dose reduction occurs, the TAK -676 dose will be reduced to 
the next lower dose that has been established as a safe dose during dose escalat ion. If init ial dose 
adjustm ent does not provi de sufficient relief, the dose of TAK -676 can be further reduced if the 
treating physician considers that the patient is benefit ing fro m study treatment. If TAK -676 dosing 
is delayed for more than 21 day s for TAK -676–related o r possibly  related toxici ties, despi te 
supportive treatment per standard clinical pract ice or more than 2 dose reductions are required in a 
patient, thi s pat ient will have study  treatm ent discont inued.

CONFIDENTIALFor AEs that occur during the study  but are not relate d to TAK -676 or pembro lizumab, the dose 
modificati on of  TAK -676 and/or pembro lizumab, in principle, is not required. However, these 
situations should be discussed with the medical mo nitor. Depending on medical condit ions and the 
possibilit y of potential wo rsening of toxicit ies by the continued administration of TAK -676 and/or 
pembro lizumab, invest igators can decide to have the TAK -676 and/or pembrolizumab dose held 
or reduced (in the case of TAK -676) until the reso lution of the AE in consultat ion with the sponsor, 
as needed.
Dose m odificat ion gui delines for toxi cities are described in Table 8.fand  Table 8.gfor TAK - 676 
based on the nature and severit y of AEs and causalit y determinat ion by invest igators. Further 
clarificati on can be obtained in consultat ion wit h the sponsor. The pembrolizumab dose cannot be 
reduced; it may only be skipped (ie, patient is not dosed), interrupted (ie, dosing is paused during 
infusio n), or di scont inued.
8.4.1 Criteria for Administering a Subsequent Dose/Starting a New Cycle
Treatment with TAK- 676 in co mbination wit h pembrolizumab will use a cycle l ength of 21 days. 
For a subsequent dose of TAK -676 to be administered or a new cy cle of  treatm ent to begin, the 
patient m ust m eet the following criteria: 
ANC ≥1000/µL, pl atelet count ≥75,000/µL, and hemoglo bin ≥8.0 g/dL.
Total  bilirubin ≤1.5 times the inst itutional ULN. For patients with Gilbert’s disease, ≤3 mg/dL.
Serum  ALT and AST ≤3.0 times the ULN (or ≤5.0 times the ULN with presence of liver 
metastases).
Albumin ≥3.0 g/dL.
Estimated creatinine clearance using the Cockcroft -Gaul t formula ≥30 mL/min.
Oxygen saturation of ≥92% on room  air.
Before administering a subsequent dose or starting a new treatment cycle, TAK -676–related 
and/or pembro lizumab -related AEs or clinically  significant l aboratory  abnorm alities must have 
returned to G rade ≤1 or baseline, except for alopecia, Grade 2 peripheral neuropathy, and/or 
autoimmune endocrinopathies with stable endocrine replacement therapy . For clinically 
significant lab values that occur during the study  but are not rel ated to TAK -676 or 
pembr olizumab, the dose modificat ion of TAK -676 and/or pembrolizumab, in principle, is not 
requi red. However, these situations should be discussed and documented with the medical mo nitor 
before administering a subsequent dose.
If the pat ient fails to meet the a bove
-cited cri teria for retreatment, treatment should be held (in the 
case of a subsequent dose) or delayed (in the case of starting a new cycle) by 1 week, at the end o f 
which the patient will be re -evaluated to determine whether the criteria for retreatm ent have been 
met. If criteria are subsequently met, the previous dose will be considered “missed” wit hin that 
cycle. If a dose reduction is considered, TAK -676 will be reduced by 1 dose level, see Section 8.4.

8.4.3 Criteria for Dose Modification o f Pembrolizumab
Dosing o f pembrolizumab cannot be reduced; it can only be skipped, interrupted, or discont inued. 
Refer to the pembrolizumab prescribing label for recommended dose modificat ion and/or 
discontinuat ion guidelines.
8.4.4 Criteria for Dose Modification of TAK -676
Dosing of TAK -676 should be reduced according to the dose modificat ion recommendat ions listed 
in Table 8.ffor nonhematologic tox icity and  Table 8.gfor hematologic toxicit ies. If indicated, 
TAK -676 dose should be reduced by at least 1 dose level (or by 50% if the pat ient is recei ving the 
first dose l evel). For Grade 1 and Grade 2 toxicit ies, the investigator may  consider m aking a dose 
adjustm ent to TAK -676 or pembro lizumab or both agents as clinically indicated by  the nature of 
toxicity. For Grade ≥3 AEs, dose adjustments to both TAK -676 and pembro lizumab must be made 
as indicated in the fo llowing tables and/or prescribing informat ion for pembro lizumab. During this 
study , further adj ustment to dose modificat ion guidelines m ay be m ade fo llowing discussio n with 
the sponsor and study  investigators.
If the init ial dose adjust ment does not provide sufficient relief, the dose of TAK -676 can be further 
reduced by another dose level wit h agreement by the sponsor if the treating physician believes that 
the pati ent is receiving benefit. Once a dose i
s reduced, i t will not be re -escalated. However, if 
further evaluat ion reveals that the AE that led to the dose reduction was not TAK -676 related, or 
there were other circumstances contributing to the AE that are unlikely to recur, the dose may be 
re-escalated to the original dose level after discussion with the sponsor and the treating physician. 
A pat ient can have up to 2 dose level reduct ions of TAK -676 as a single agent or in combinat ion 
due to AEs, but further reductions are not permitted (the patient shoul d discontinue study  drug in 
this case).

8.8 Management of Clinical Events 
Therapies that are required to manage AEs and control cancer symptoms are allowed base d on 
standard clinical pract ice, unless specifically  excluded. Supporti ve care agents, such as G -CSF, 
blood products (RBC and platelet transfusio ns), and pain medications are permitted as needed per 
ASH/ASCO guidelines or local inst itutional pract ice. Howe ver, these agents should not be used in 
this study in a manner that would eit her help establish eligibilit y for the study or support escalatio n 
of study  drug dose during dose escalat ion. If dose alterations are necessary  because of the events 
detailed belo w, pl ease refer to Secti on 8.4.
In the sections below, guidance is provided for the management of some AEs that could be 
expected based on observat ions in nonclinical toxicology or because of the mechanism o f action o f 
TAK -676, pembro lizumab, or radiat ion. This guidance is not expected to replace invest igator 
judgment in the management of AEs.
Notably, for any  clinically  significant Grade ≥3 AEs, refe rral to an appropri ate subspecialist 
shoul d be considered.
8.8.1 Pulmonary Vasculature Toxicity/Noncardiogenic Pulmonary Edema
TAK -676 administration was associated with pulmonary  changes in mo nkeys (please refer to the 
IB for details) that could resemble vascul ar leak or noncardiogenic pulmo nary edema in humans. 
To m onitor for this potential side effect and minimize the clinical risk to patients, the following 
will be performed for patients enrolled:
Vital signs will  be collected before, during and aft er administration of TAK -676.
On T AK-676 dosing days in Cycle 1, an addit ional postdose physical examinat ion will include 
an assessment of the respiratory  system . 
Oxygenat ion shoul d be carefully  monitored and maintained as clinically  indicated. Careful 
diagnosis and aggressive correction of pulmo nary symptoms should occur quickly.

Although TAK -676 is not a bio logic agent, i ts immune -activating properties may produce AEs in 
the category  of infusio n-related reactions. If an infusion -related reacti on were to occur, it could 
present as fever, chills, rigors, headache, rash, flushing, pruritus, arthralgias, hypotensio n or 
hypertensio n, bronchospasm, or other symptoms.

8.8.4 Infusion Site Care
Lesio ns at the inject ion site, which may include inflammat ion or necrosis, represent a potential risk 
and were observed as microscopic changes only  in a non -GLP experiment in rats. Local 
institutional guidelines m ust be applied to stress proper administration and prevent ion of 
accidental  extravasat ion of TAK -676. Usage of an IV port or central access is highly  
recommended. The IV line should be flushed as directed in the Pharmacy Manual at the end of 
each infusio n accordi ngly to local procedures. Patients should be instructed to report any 
discomfort, pain, or swelling at the infusio n site. Monitoring at the beginning and during the 
infusio n for any  disco mfort, pain, or swelling must be ensured. If extravasat ion occurs, th e 
infusio n must be di scont inued immediately, and supportive measures or inst itutional guidelines 
applied. There is no known antidote to TAK -676.

8.8.6 Nausea and/or Vomiting
This study will not init ially emplo y prophylact ic antiemet ics before the first dose of the study drug 
during dose escalat ion. However, a patient who develops nausea or vomit ing will be act ively 
managed by  employing optimal  antiemetic treatment based on local standard practice. 
Addit ionally , anti emet ics may be used prophylact ically as clinically indicated fo llowing the 
occurrence of a first event of study  drug –related or possibly related nausea and/or vomit ing. An 
optimal ant iemetic regimen is defined as one that emplo ys a neurolept ic, a 5 -HT 3serotonin 
receptor antagonist, or an NK -1 antagoni st may be added. Steroi d use shoul d be avo ided unl ess it

shoul d follow evolving consensus guidelines for management of immune mediated toxicit ies 
(Brahmer et al. 2021 ; Brahmer et al. 2018 ).
8.8.7 Diarrhea
This study  will not ini tially emplo y prophylact ic ant idiarrheals. However, there is no prohibit ion 
against their use in the management of a patient who develops diarrhea. Patients will be instructed 
to take antidiarrh eal medicati on(s) at the physician’s discret ion unt il they are diarrhea -free for at 
least 12 hours. Fluid intake should be maintained to avo id dehydrat ion. If the diarrhea is thought to 
be immune mediated or immune -mediated colit is is suspected, management shoul d follow 
evolving consensus guidelines for management of immune mediated toxicit ies (Brahmer et al . 
2021; Brahmer et al. 2018 ).
8.8.8 Skin Conditions/Rash
It is recommended that for all severit y grades of cutaneous events, the diagnostic work -up should 
include:
Evaluat ion of a pertinent history  and physical examinat ion.
Ruling out any  other eti ology of the skin problem (including infect ion, another drug side 
effect, a skin condit ion linked to another systemic disease or unrelated primary skin disorder).
Evaluat ion of laboratory  values, including a blood cell count, liver and kidney  tests.
Directed serol ogic studi es if an autoimmune condit ion is suspected.

8.8.10 Management of Pembrolizumab Immune -Mediated AEs
Pembrolizumab can cause immune -mediated reactions, including pneumo nitis, colit is, hepatit is, 
endocrinopathies, nephrit is, skin advers e reacti ons, and infusio n-related reactions. Monitoring o f 
these AEs is required through 90 days after the last dose of study drug or the start of subsequent 
anticancer therapy , whichever occurs first. Patients with AEs that are suspected to be related to 
pembro lizumab should be evaluated by appropriate methodology , incl uding physical  
examinat ions, laboratory  tests, and imaging. Dosing of pembro lizumab should be interrupted 
based on the guidance in Sect ion 8.4. Treatment of these AEs should fo llow evo lving consensus 
guidelines for management of potential immune CPI-related AEs(Brahmer et al. 2018 )and will be 
based on SOC, local inst itutional guidance, the WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS section of 
the package insert, and the proper use guidance of pembro lizumab.
8.8.11 Management of Radiation -Associated AEs
There i s a potential for synergist ic toxicit y with combinat ion use of radiat ion and pembro lizumab 
with or wi thout TAK -676. Increased inflammation or radiation burn in the radiat ion field will be 
treated with local measures as per i nstitutional guidelines. Antibiot ics (local or systemic) m ay be 
used if there is a clinical suspicio n of infect ion.
8.8.12 Management of COVID -19–Positive Patients
A consensus plan of action has been developed for the management of patients within the context 
of the COVID -19 pandemic. During the screening period ,a patient who exhibit s symptom s 
consistent with COVID -19 (eg, fever, shortness of breath, sore throat) will undergo COVID -19 
testing as per institutional guidelines. A pat ient with a negative test result will undergo further 
diagnosti c work -up and management at the discret ion of the site investigator. If a patient tests 
positive for COVID -19 during the screening period, enrollment should be paused during which 
time the invest igator, in consultat ion with the sponsor, will determine the appropriate course of 
action for that pati ent. For patients with symptoms and/or requiring treatment, symptoms should 
have reso lved to baseline and treatment should be completed at least 7 days before enro llment (a 
negat ive te st for severe acute respiratory  syndrom e coronavi rus-2 [SARS -CoV -2] by polymerase 
chain react ion
(PCR )may also be documented if required by local inst itutional guidelines). 
Asymptomat ic pat ients who test posit ive should wait at least 7 days fro m the posit ive test result to

9.4.14.1 Special Allow ances to RECIST v.1.1 and Treatment Beyond Progression
9.4.14.1.1 Irradiated and Nonirradiated Response
In order to meet the secondary  object ive of this study, investigators (or designee) are asked to not 
only assess overall  response at each timepo int using RECIST v.1.1, but also to assess both the 
irradi ated and noni rradiated response at each timepoint as depicted in Figure 9.aaligning with 
principles akin to th ose of  itRECIST (where intratumoral therapy  references are l argely  replaced 
with radiation therapy )(Goldmacher et al . 2020 ).

itRECIST

TI: target irradiated; T -NI: target nonirradiated; NT -I: nontarget irradiated; NT -NI: nontarget nonirradiated
According to the inclusio n criteria, pati ents m ust have at least 2 measurable lesio ns (ie ,>10mm 
longest di ameter for extranodal lesio ns, >15 mm short axis for lymph nodes), with at least one 
inside and at least one other outside of the radiation field. As stated in Sect ion 8.1.1, 1 l esion and 
up to 3 lesio ns may be radiated. For the purposes of response assessment, inves tigators are asked to 
evaluate response using both RECIST v.1.1 and modified itRECIST.

CONFIDENTIALThe principles of RECIST v.1.1 still apply  whereby  select ion of target lesio ns in a previously 
irradi ated area or in an area subjected to other loco -regional therapy, unless there has been 
demonstrated progression in the lesio n(s),is discouraged ;therefore ,irradiated lesions in this study 
will not be con sidered part of the RECIST v.1.1 assessment. No more than 5 target lesio ns in total 
and no more than 2 per organ may be selected in accordance with RECIST v.1.1. The same lesio ns 
ident ified as target and nontarget at screening, before radiat ion administrat ion, will be fo llowed at 
each subsequent response assessment.
For response assessment using modified itRECIST, lesio n measurements should be performed per 
RECIST v.1.1 per guidelines on size and reproducibilit y, except that i t is acceptable to select the 
irradi ated l esions as target l esions. Baseline l esions are categorized as target irradiated (T -I), 
target, nonirradiated (T -NI), nontarget irradiated (NT -I), and nontarget nonirradiated (NT- NI) 
according to an algorithm ( Figure 9.a). The same target and nontarget lesio ns selected as part of 
the RECIST v.1.1 assessment at screening may be used for the nonirradiated target or nontarget 
lesions selected under the modified itRECIST assessment. One and up to 3lesions m ay be 
irradi ated. At l east 1lesion must be T-I,while the remaining 2may be T-Ior NT-I. One to 3
measurable lesio ns are designated as T- I and are used to evaluate the irradiated lesio n response.
One to 5measurable lesio ns are designated as T- NI. The i rradi ated response i s based ent irely on 
T-I lesio ns aggregating the sum of the largest diameter for all o f the irradiated target lesio ns, while 
the nonirradiated response is based ent irely on T -NI lesions aggregating the sum o f the largest 
diameter for all of the nonirradiated target lesio ns.Overall target lesio n response, nontarget lesio n 
response, and new lesio n appearance are defined as they  are f or RECIST v.1.1 and combined 
similarly  to determine the itRECIST overall response for each visit. The overall response should 
include all lesio ns classified as target at baseline ( sum of diameters of T-I and T -NI combined v s
sum of diameters at baseline and at nadir), all nontarget lesio ns (NT -I and NT -NI) combined 
(classified as absent, present, or collectively showing unequivocal progressio n),and new lesio ns.
9.4.14.1.2 Treatment Beyond Progression
RECIST v.1.1 criteria and not modified itRECIST criteria will be used to evaluate considerat ions 
for treatmen t beyo nd progression. When assessing response, special considerat ion should be give n 
to the tum or response characterist ics associated with immunotherapy:
1.Measurable tumor size reduct ion may take longer with immunotherapy  than wi th a cy totoxi c 
regimen.
2.Resp onse to immunotherapy  may occur after appearance of PD, as assessed per conventional 
RECIST v.1.1 (see Appendix H). In particular, small, new lesio ns m ay appear in the presence 
of other responsive target lesio ns (pseudo -progressio n).
3.Durable stable disease (SD) may represent antitumor activit y of immunotherapy .
Therefore, allowances to RECIST v.1.1 will be implemented in this study  as described below.
Accumulating data indicate it is possible that some patients treated with immunotherapy  may 
derive clinical benefit bey ond ini tial RECIST -defined PD. The protocol therefore accommodates 
an option to keep patients on treatment beyond such init ial progression i f specific criteria are met.

CONFIDENTIALAccordingly , patients will be permitted to continue treatment beyond init ial RECIST v.1.1 -defined 
PD if the fo llowing criteria are met:
1.Invest igator -assessed overall clinical benefit fro m continued treatment with pembro lizumab 
and/or TAK -676. The assessment of clinical benefit should consider whether the patient is 
clinically deteriorating and unlikely to receive further benefit fro m continued treatment.
2.Tolerance of study  drug(s).
3.Stabl e performance status.
4.Treatment bey ond apparent progression will not delay an imminent intervent ion to prevent 
serious com plicat ions of PD (eg, central nervous system metastases).
5.Patient-provided written informed consent describing any reasonably foreseeable risks or 
discomforts, or other alte rnative treatment options.
The decisio n to continue treatment beyo nd init ial RECIST v.1.1 -defined progression should be 
discussed with the Takeda medical mo nitor and documented in the study records. Then, the patient  
may remain on the study  and continue to receive monitoring according to the protocol- defined 
SOEs. Treatment should be discont inued permanent ly upon documentation of further PD. If the 
patient experiences rapid clinical deterioration as perceived by  the invest igator within 8 weeks of 
original  PD and before addit ional radiographic assessment, the invest igator can discontinue the 
study  treatm ent wi thout obj ective evidence of disease progression and report it as “symptomatic 
deteri oration.”
Patients who con tinue study  therapy  beyond initial RECIST v.1.1- defined progression will be 
considered to have invest igator -assessed PD at the time of the init ial progression event, if the 
progression is confirmed on the subsequent scan as detailed in SOE 
(Appendix A).

9.4.15.2.2 Fresh Paired Tumor Biopsy
All patients with a safely  accessible lesi on outsi de the radiat ion field who enroll at dose levels of 
TAK -676 that have been show n to have pharmacodynamic act ivity will have m andatory  tumor 
biopsy performed at screening and during Cycle 1 between Days 15 and 21 if, in the opinion o f the 
investigator, such a biopsy would not place the patient at an unjust ifiable risk. Pharmacodynamic
activit y is defined as evidence o f TAK -676– mediated stimulat ion of the innate and/or adaptive 
immune system in the blood (refer to Section
 9.4.15.1 )and/or clinical response (CR/PR) in at least 
1 pati ent from ongoing clinical studies. Dosing cohorts may  be backfilled, as needed, to achieve 
this object ive. Once pharmacodynamic act ivity is observed ,biopsies will be required fro m all 
patients wi th safel y accessible nonirradiated lesio ns enro lled in dose escalat ion. The number of 
patients proj ected to be needed to support a statist ically supported posterior probabilit y is outlined 
in Appendix K. Tum or biopsies are opti onal, but strongly  encouraged, for patients enrolling at 
lower dose levels. 
The tum or tissue biopsy  at screening should be performed at least 2 days after the last dose of any 
prior antineoplastic therapy and within 3 weeks before the first dose of radiat ion. Screening biopsy 
shoul d be perform ed only when the patient is considered otherwise eligible. The paired tumor 
biopsies should be performed on a lesio n not targeted for irradiat ion and, when possible, c ollected 
from the same l esion (pre -and post -treatm ent). Patients with a tumor biopsy obtained less than or 
equal  to 3 m onths before init iation of radiation therapy  on tri al will  not be requi red to undergo a 
repeat pretreatment biopsy, assuming 1) adequate tumor tissue is available for analysis 
(form alin-fixed, paraffin-embedded block preferred) and 2) no additional ant ineoplastic agents 
were administered since the time of the biopsy .
Tumor biopsy  procedures m ust be perform ed according to standard site prac tice. The accessible 
lesion bi opsied shoul d not have been previously  irradi ated. The tum or biopsy  procedure will be 
perform ed by  core needle, under radiological guidance if indicated, or surgically  if the si te of 
disease is superficial and palpable or visi ble. For tum or biopsies, at least 3 ti ssue cores of 1 cm 
each obtained using an 18 -gauge end -cut needl e are requested. These paired biopsies will be used 
to evaluate changes in bio markers fo llowing treatment with radiat ion and pembro lizumab in 
combinat ion with TAK -676, including the modulatio n of the tumor immune cell profile and 
impact on the tumor. The specific anatomical locatio n of the biopsy should be noted upon

The fo llowing bio marker and pharmacodynamic measures will be tested:
Plasma Sample for Circulat ing Bio markers 
Plasma sam ples will be collected to monitor the treatment -induced changes in peripheral 
biomarkers, including cy tokines and chemokines (for example IP -10, an IFN -inducible 
chemokine). The changes in cytokines and chemokines will be used to identify potential 
pharmacodynamic act ivity. Additional analysis may  explore whether l evels of any  of these 
biomarkers correlate with probab ility of response or of adverse reactions to radiation and 
pembro lizumab in co mbinat ion with TAK -676.
Blood Sam ple for Imm unophenoty ping
Blood sam ples will be collected for assessment of immunophenoty pic changes in circulat ing 
immune cells induced by radiati on and pembrolizumab in combinat ion with TAK -676. These 
blood sam ples will  be analyzed for the presence and changes in immune cell state by  
immunophenoty ping; including, but not limited to B and T lymphocy tes, m onocy tes, NK cells, 
and DCs.
Blood Sam ple for RNA 
Blood sam ples f or RNA will be collected for sequencing or expression analysis to monitor gene 
expressio n changes as a pharmacodynamic effect of radiat ion and pembro lizumab in combinat ion 
with TAK -676 where acceptable by law. The induction of t he STING agonism/t ype I IFN gene 
signature will  be evaluated as part of this analysis. Addit ional blood sam ples collected at select 
centers m ay be analyzed by single cell RNA sequencing to determine changes in gene expressio n 
within part icular cell t ypes o f interest, including T cells, NK cells, and monocy tes.
Blood Sam ple for Receptor Sequencing
To m onitor for induction o f an adapt ive immune response, blood samples will be co llected to 
sequence T cell and B cell receptors where acceptable by  law. Cl onali tyand diversit y of the 
receptors m ay be evaluated wi th any significant changes being associated with an expanded or 
contracted cellular populat ion.
Plasma Sample for Cell -Free DNA
Plasma sam ples will be collected for evaluation of cell -free DNA where accept able by  law. From  
the cell -free DNA, ci rculat ing tumor DNA may be evaluated to assess tumor mutations.

As detailed in the SOE 
(Appendix A), a buccal epithelial cell sample will be collected during 
screening to extract DNA as a control sample for DNA mutation analysis fro m banked tum or

Patients will  be considered to have completed study  treatm ent if they  discontinue pembrolizumab 
and/or TAK -676 f or any  of the reasons outlined in Section 9.7.
9.7 Discontinuation of Treatment With Study Drug and Patient Replacement
Patients will be informed that they have the right to discontinue study treatment at any time for any 
reason, without prejudice to their medical care. A patient’s participation in the study  may also be 
discontinued at any  time at the di scret ion of the Investigator. It is possible that 1 study  drug is 
perm anent ly discont inued due to treatment -related AEs, while the patient continues to receive the 
other study  drug and rem ains on treatm ent. Di scontinuat ion of treatment occurs only when both 
study  drugs are required to be discont inued due to AEs or upon the occurrence of any o f the other 
non-AE c riteria.
Treatment with radiation and/or study drugs may be discont inued for any o f the fo llowing reasons:
AE 
Protocol  deviat ion (after discussion wit h sponsor).
PD (tum or progressi on docum ented as assessed per RECIST v.1.1): as noted previously , 
patients who meet the criteria for PD per RECIST v.1.1 may  cont inue to stay  on study  if they 
are clinically  benefi tting (see Section 9.4.14.1 ). In these patien ts, treatm ent di scont inuat ion 
shoul d occur when a subsequent scan confirms the init ial PD, unless there are earlier clear 
signs of rapid clinical progressio n (clinical progressio n is defined as no imaging test performed 
to assess tumor status, but the inve stigator considers that patient decline is caused by tumor 
progression).
Symptom atic deteri oration (the patient presents a decline in health that recommends 
terminating treatment, and tumor imaging is performed and does not qualify for PD).
Initiation of  another sy stemic ant icancer treatment.
Pregnancy (patient must be discontinued).

Once both study drugs have been discont inued, all stud y procedures outlined for the EOT visit will 
be co mpleted as specified in the SOE ( Appendix A). If a patient is not able to return for the EOT 
visit, the EOT assessments may  be perform ed at the time of treatment discont inuat ion. The 
primary  reason for study  drug discont inuat ion will be recorded on the eCRF. If the reason for 
ending treatment is also the reason for end of study (EOS) (for example, death), the EOS eCRF 
shoul d be com pleted.
Patients not receiving all required doses of radiat ion, TAK -676, and pembro lizumab through 
Cycle 1 for reasons other than DLTs will not be considered DLT evaluable but may remain on 
study . If a patient is DLT inevaluable , patient replacement may not be mandatory. In this case, the 
decisio n for pati ent repl acement can be determined based on the number of DLT -evaluable 
patients in the cohort, as agreed between the sponsor and investigators.
In the case of study  terminat ion by the sponsor, eligible patients may  have cont inued access to 
TAK -676/pembro lizumab as described in Sect ion 6.3.5 .
9.8 Posttreatment Follow -up Assessme nts
Some pat ients may discont inue study drug for reasons other than PD; these patients will remain in 
the study  for follow-up and will be fo llowed every  12 weeks (±1 week) from the EOT visit until 
the occurrence of PD, loss to fo llow-up, consent wit hdrawal , the start of subsequent systemic 
antineoplastic therapy, study terminat ion, or death, whichever occurs first. Survival status, date of 
disease progressi on based on available local data, and subsequent anticancer therapies will be 
collected during this fo llow-up period. This information may be co llected by methods that include, 
but are not limited to, telephone, email, mail, or retrieval fro m online or other databases (eg, Socia l 
Securi ty indexes).
The EOS eCRF is to be completed when the patient discont inues fro m the follow
-up period. 
Note: Related SAEs must be reported to the Global Pharmacovigilance department or designee. 
This includes deaths or SAEs that the invest igator considers related to study drug that occur during 
posttreatment fo llow-up. Refer to Secti on 10.0 for details regarding definit ions, docum entati on, 
and reporting of SAEs.
9.9 Completion of Study (for Individual Patients)

At this time, the EOS eCRF should be completed.
9.10 Study Compliance
Radiation treatment and study  drug (s)will be administered or dispensed only to eligible pat ients 
under the supervisio n of the invest igator or ident ified subinvestigator(s). The appropriate study  
personnel will maintain records of study  drug receipt and dispensing.
Tests and procedures shou ld be performed on schedule; however, unless otherwise specified, 
occasi onal changes are allo wable wi thin a 3 -day window for holidays, vacat ions, and other 
administrative reasons. If extenuat ing circumstances prevent a patient fro m beginning treatment or 
completing a scheduled procedure or assessment wit hin this t ime, the patient may continue the 
study  only  with the wri tten permissio n of the medical mo nitor. If an AE occurs after study 
radiation treatment (irrespect ive of causalit y) that leads to a delay  inthe start of pl anned study  
drug(s) administration on Cycle 1 Day 1, Cycle 1 Day 1 may be delayed for up to 1 week fo llowing 
discussio n with the Medi cal Moni tor or desi gnee. Any Cycle 1 Day  1 delays bey ond this 
timeframe would require addit ional approval f rom the Medi cal Monitor or designee.
Allowable windows on dosing days are described in Section 8.1.3 .
If a dose of TAK -676 is held for up to 21 days for reasons unrelated to toxicit y, the patient may be 
discontinued fro m the study  following a discussio n between the investigator and the sponsor.
10.0 ADVERSE EVENTS
10.1 Definitions
10.1.1 Pretreatment Event Definition
A pretreatment event is any untoward medical occurre nce in a patient or subject who has signed 
inform ed consent to participate in a study  but before administration of any  study  medicati on; it 
does not necessarily  have to have a causal relat ionship wit h study  parti cipat ion.

CONFIDENTIAL10.1.2 AE Definition
AE m eans any  untoward medical occurrence in a patient administered a pharmaceut ical product; 
the untoward medical occurrence does not necessarily have a causal relat ionship with this 
treatm ent. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory  finding), symptom, or disease temporally  associ ated wi th the use of a m edicinal 
(invest igational) product whether or not it is related to the medicinal product. This includes any 
newly occurring event or a previous condit ion that has increased i n severit y or frequency since the 
administration of study  drug.
All abnorm al laboratory  values will be reviewed by the investigator but only those abnormal 
values that lead to discont inuat ion or del ay in treatment, dose m odificat ion, therapeutic 
intervent ion, or are considered by the invest igator to be a clinically significant change fro m 
baseline will be assessed as AEs.
10.1.3 SAE Definition
SAE m eans any untoward medical occurrence that at any  dose:
Results in death.
Is life-threatening (refers to an AE in which the patient was at risk of death at the time of the 
event. It does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were 
more severe).
Requi res inpat ienthospitalization or prolongation of an existing hospitalization (see 
clarificati on in the paragraph in Sect ion 10.2 on planned hospitalizat ions).

substant ial disrupt ion of a person’s abilit y to conduct normal life functions).
Is a congenital ano maly/birth defect.
Is a medically important event . This refers to an AE that may  not resul t in death, be 
immediately  life-threatening, or require hospitalization, but may be considered serious when, 
based on appropriate medical judgment, it may jeopardize the patient, require medical or 
surgi cal interventi on to prevent 1 of the outcomes listed above, or involves suspected 
transmissio n via a medicinal product of an infect ious agent. Examples of such medical events 
include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, 
blood dyscrasias or convulsio ns that do not result in inpatient hospitalizat ion, or th e 
development of drug dependency  or drug abuse; any  organism , virus, or infecti ous parti cle 
(eg,prion protein transmitt ing transmissible spongiform encephalopathy), pathogenic or 
nonpathogenic, is considered an infect ious agent. In addit ion to the above examples, any event 
that the investigator considers to be medically important will be considered an SAE.
In thi s study , intensi ty for each AE, including any  laboratory  abnorm ality, will be determined 
using the NCI CTCAE, Versi on 5.0. Clarificat ion should be made between an SAE and an AE that 
is considered severe in intensit y (Grade 3 or 4) because the terms serious and severe are NOT

CONFIDENTIALsynonymous. The general term severe is often used to describe the intensit y (severit y) of a specific 
event; the event itself, however, may be of relatively minor medical significance (such as a Grade 
3 headache). This is NOT the same as serious , which is based on patient/event outcome or action 
criteria described above and is usually associated wit h events that pose a threat to apatient’s life or 
abilit y to funct ion. A severe AE (Grade 3 or 4) does not necessarily need to be considered serious. 
For example, a white blood cell count of 1000/mm3to less than 2000/mm3is considered Grade 3 
(severe) but may not be considered serious. Seriousness (not intensit y) serves as a guide for 
defining regulatory  reporti ng obligat ions.
10.2 Procedures for Recording and Reporting AEs and SAEs
All AEs spontaneously reported by  the pati ent or in response to an open question fro m study  
personnel or revealed by observation, physical examinat ion, or other diagnostic procedures will be 
recorded on the appropriate page of the eCRF (see Section 10.3 for the period of observat ion). Any 
clinically relevant deterioration in laboratory assessments or other clinical finding is considered an 
AE. When possible, signs and symptoms indicating a com mon underlying patho logy shoul d be 
noted as a single comprehensive event.
Regardless o f causalit y, SAEs (as defined in Sect ion 10.1.3 ) must be reported (see Section 10.3 for 
the period of observation) by the investiga tor to the Takeda Global Pharmacovigilance depart ment 
or desi gnee wi thin 24 hours of becoming aware of the event. This should be done by transmitting 
an electronic data capture (EDC) SAE report. If transmissio n of an EDC SAE report is not feasible 
within 24 hours of becoming aware of this event, then a Takeda paper-based SAE form should be 
submitted via fax at the fax numbers provided belo w. The SAE form, created specifically  by 
Takeda, will be provided to each clinical study  site. A sam ple of the paper -based SAE form  and 
processing direct ions are found in the Study  Manual . Inform ation in the SAE report or form must 
be consistent with the data provided on the eCRF. 
In case of faxing a paper -based SAE form, site personnel need to confirm successful transmiss ion 
of all pages and include an email address on the fax cover sheet so that an acknowledgment of 
recei pt can be returned via email wit hin 1 business day .
FaxNumbers:
United States and Canada: + 1 -800-963-6290
Rest of World: + 1

Email submissi on of SAE forms with a PDF attachment should only be used in the case where fax 
is not possible, and EDC is not feasible wit hin 24 hours of receiving the event. In case of email, site 
personnel need to confirm successful transmissio n by awaiting an acknowl edgment of the recei pt 
via email wit hin 1 business day.

If SAEs are reported via fax or by email, EDC/RAVE must be updated as soon as possible wit h the 
appropriate informat ion.
If informat ion not availab le at the time of the first report becomes available at a later date, then the 
investigator will transmit a fo llow-up EDC SAE report (or a paper -based SAE form if an EDC 
SAE report is not feasible) or provide other documentation immediately wit hin 24 hours of receipt. 
Copi es of  any relevant data from the hospi tal notes (eg, ECGs, l aboratory  tests, di scharge 
summary, postmortem results) should be sent to the addressee, if requested.
All SAEs should be fo llowed up unt il reso lution or perm anent outcome of the event. The timelines 
and procedure for follow -up reports are the same as those for the init ial report.
Planned hospital admissio ns or surgical procedures for an illness or disease that existed before the 
patient was enrolled in the study  are not to be cons idered AEs unless the condition deteriorated in 
an unexpected manner during the study; eg, surgery  was perform ed earlier or l ater than planned.
For both serious and nonserious AEs, the invest igator must determine both the severit y (toxi city 
grade) of the e vent and the relat ionship of the event to study drug administration. 
Severit y (toxi city grade) for each AE, including any  laboratory  abnorm ality, will  be determined 
using the NCI CTCAE, Version 5.0. The cri teria are provided in the Study  Manual.
Relations hip of the event to study  drug administratio n (ie, its causali ty) will be determined by  the 
investigator responding y es (rel ated) or no (unrelated) to this quest ion: Is there a reasonable 
possibilit y that the AE is associated with the study  drug/s?
10.3 Monitor ing of AEs and Period of Observation
AEs, both nonserious and serious, will be mo nitored throughout the study  as fo llows:
All AEs will be reported from the time of signing of the informed consent through 30 days 
after the administration o f the last dose of study  drug(s) or before init iation of new anticancer 
therapy  (whichever com es first) and recorded in the eCRFs.
AEs that the invest igator considers to be immune -mediated will be reported through 90 days 
after the administration o f the last dose of study  drug(s) or before init iation of new anticancer 
therapy  (whichever com es first) and recorded in the eCRFs.
SAEs will be reported to the Takeda Global Pharmacovigilance department or designee from 
the time of signing o f informed consent through 30 days after administration of the last dose of 
study  drug(s) or before init iation of new ant icancer therapy (whichever comes first) and 
recorded in the eCRF. 
Only related SAEs occurring greater than 30 day s after the l ast dose of study  drug(s) (until 
patient complete s the study or init iates new ant icancer therapy) must be reported to the Takeda 
Global Pharm acovigilance department or designee.

A product com plaint is a verbal, written, or electronic expression that implies dissat isfaction 
regarding the identit y, strength, puri ty, quali ty, or s tabilit y of a drug product. Individuals who 
ident ify a potential product complaint situat ion shoul d immedia tely report this via the phone 
numbers or email addresses provided in the Study  Manual .
A medicat ion error is a preventable event that involves an ident ifiable pat ient and l eads to 
inappropriate medicat ion use, which may  resul t in patient harm. Overdoses a nd underdoses 
constitute medicat ion errors. Individuals who identify  a potenti al medicat ion error (including 
overdose) situation should immediately report this via the phone numbers or email addresses 
provi ded in the Study  Manual.
Product complaints and me dicat ion errors in and of themselves are not AEs. If a product complaint

is important that the invest igator and other study  personnel are available during the monitoring 
visits and that sufficient time is devoted to the process.
14.2 Protocol Deviations
The invest igator should not deviate fro m the protocol , except where necessary  to eliminate an 
immediate hazard to study subjects. Should other unexpected circumstances arise that will requ ire 
deviat ion from protocol -specified procedures, the investigator should consult with the sponsor or 
designee (and IRB or IEC, as required) to determine the appropriate course of action. There will be 
no exempt ions (a prospectively approved deviat ion) fro m the inclusio n or exclusio n criteria.

CONFIDENTIALThe site should document all protocol deviat ions in the subject’s source documents. In the event of 
a significant devi ation, the si te shoul d notify  the sponsor or i ts desi gnee (and IRB or EC, as 
requi red). Si gnificant deviat ions include, but are not limited to, those that invo lve fraud or 
misconduct, increase the healt h risk to the subject, or confound interpretation of the primary stud y 
assessment.
The sponsor will assess any protocol deviat ion; if it is likely to aff ect to a si gnificant degree the 
safet y and ri ghts of  a subject or the reliabilit y and robustness o f the data generated, it may be 
reported to regulatory  authori ties as a seri ous breach of GCP and the protocol.
14.3 Quality Assurance Audits and Regulatory Agency Inspections
The study  site also m ay be subject to qualit y assurance audi ts by  the sponsor or desi gnees. In this 
circumstance, the sponsor -designated audi tor will  contact the si te in advance to arrange an 
auditing visit. The auditor may ask to visit the fa cilities where laboratory  samples are collected, 
where the medication is stored and prepared, and any other facilit y used during the study . In 
addition, there is the possibilit y that this study may be inspected by regulatory agencies, including 
those of fo reign governments (eg, the US FDA, the United Kingdo m [UK] Medicines and 
Healthcare products Regul atory  Agency  [MHRA], the Pharmaceut icals and Medical Devices 
Agency of Japan [PMDA]). If the study site is contacted for an inspect ion by a regulatory body, t he 
sponsor should be notified immediately. The investigator and inst itution guarantee access for 
qualit y assurance auditors to all study  documents as described in Section 14.1.
15.0 ETHICAL ASPECTS OF T HE STUDY
This study  will be conducted wi th the highest respect for the individual participants (ie, patients) 
according to the protocol, the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration o f 
Helsinki, and the ICH Harmonised Tripart ite Guideline for GCP. Each investigator will conduct 
the study  according to applicable local or regional regulatory  requi rements and align his or her 
conduct in accordance with the responsibilit ies of the invest igato r that are listed in Appendix B. 
The principles of Helsinki are addressed through the protocol and through appendices containing 
requi rements for informed consent and invest igator responsibilities.
15.1 IRB and/or IEC Approval
IRBs and IECs must be constituted according to the applicable requirements of each participat ing 
region. The sponsor or designee will require documentation noting all names and titles of members 
who make up the respect ive IRB or IEC. If any member of the IR B or IEC has direct participat ion 
in this study , written notificat ion regarding his or her abst inence fro m voting must al so be 
obtained. Those American sites unwilling to provide names and tit les of all members because of 
privacy  and conflict of interest c oncerns should instead provide a Federal wide Assurance number 
or com parable number assigned by  the US Department of Healt h and Human Services.
The sponsor or designee will supply relevant documents for submissio n to the respective IRB or 
IEC for the proto col’s review and approval. This protocol, the IB, a copy of the ICF, and, if 
applicable, subject recruit ment materials and adverti sements and other documents required by all

CONFIDENTIALapplicable laws and regulations must be submitted to a central or local IRB or IEC for approval. 
The IRB’s or IEC’s written approval o f the protocol and subject informed consent must be 
obtained and submitted to the sponsor or designee before commencement of the study , ie, before 
shipment of the sponsor -supplied drug or study -specific screening act ivity. The IRB or IEC 
approval  must ref er to the study  by its exact protocol  title, number, and versio n date; ident ify 
versio ns of other documents (eg, ICF) reviewed; and state the approval date. If required by country 
or regi onal regulat ions or procedures, approval from the com petent regulatory  authori ty will be 
obtained before commencement of the study  or impl ementati on of  a substant ial amendment. The 
sponsor will notify  site once the sponsor has confirmed the adequacy  of site regul atory  
docum entati on and, when applicable, the sponsor has received permissio n from the com petent 
authori ty to begin the study . Unt il the site receives notification, no protocol activit ies, including 
screening, may  occur.
Sites m ust adhere to all requirements stipulat ed by  their respect ive IRB or IEC. This may include 
notification to the IRB or IEC regarding protocol amendments, updates to the ICF, recruit ment 
materi als intended for viewing by  subjects, l ocal safety reporting requirements, reports and 
updates regarding the ongoing review of the study  at intervals specified by the respect ive IRB or 
IEC, and submissio n of the invest igator’s final status report to IRB or IEC. All IRB and IEC 
approval s and rel evant docum entati on for these i tems must be provi ded to the spons or (or 
designee).
Patients incent ives should not exert undue influence for participat ion. Payments to subjects must 
be approved by the IRB or IEC and sponsor.
15.2 Patient Information, Informed Consent, and Patient Authorization
Written consent documents will e mbody  the elements of informed consent as described in the 
Declaration of Helsinki and the ICH Guidelines for GCP and will be in accordance with all 
applicable laws and regulations. The ICF describes the planned and permitted uses, transfers, and 
disclosures of the patient’s personal and personal health informat ion for purposes of conducting 
the study. The ICF and the patient informat ion sheet (if applicable) further explain the nature of the 
study , its obj ectives, and potential risks and benefit s, and the date informed consent is given. The 
ICF will detail the requirements of the participant and the fact that he or she is free to withdraw at 
any time wit hout giving a reason and wit hout prejudice to his or her further medical care.
The investigator is respon sible for the preparation, content, and IRB or IEC approval of the ICF 
and, if applicable, the patient authorization form. The ICF, patient authorizat ion form (if 
applicable), and patient information sheet (if applicable) must be approved by both the IRB o r IEC 
and the sponsor before use.
The ICF, patient authorization form (if applicable), and patient informat ion sheet (if applicable) 
must be written in a language fully co mprehensible to the prospective pat ient. It is the 
responsibilit y of the invest igator to explain the detailed elements of the ICF, patient authorizat ion 
form (if applicable), and patient informat ion sheet (if applicable) to the patient. Information should 
be given in both oral and wr itten form whenever possible and in the manner deemed app ropriate by

CONFIDENTIALthe IRB or IEC. If the patient is not capable of rendering adequate written informed consent, then 
the pati ent’s l egally acceptable representative may provide such consent for the patient in 
accordance with applicable laws and regulat ions.
The patient, or the patient’s legally acceptable representative (if acceptable at site), must be given 
ample opportuni ty to (1) inquire about details of the study and (2) decide whether to participate in 
the study. If the patient, or the patient’s legally acce ptabl e representative, determines that he or she 
will part icipate in the study , then the ICF and patient authorizat ion form (if applicable) must be 
signed and dated by  the patient, or the patient’s legally  acceptable representative, at the time of 
consent and before the patient enters into the study. The patient or the patient’s legally acceptable 
representative should be instructed to sign using their legal names, not nicknames, using a 
ballpo int pen wi th either blue or bl ack ink. The investigator must als o sign and date the ICF and 
patient authori zation (if applicable) at the time of consent and before the patient enters into the 
study; however, the sponsor may  allow a designee of the invest igator to sign to the extent 
permitted by  applicable law.
Once signed, the ori ginal  ICF, pati ent authori zation form (if applicable), and pat ient informat ion 
sheet (if applicable) will be stored in the investigator’s site file. The investigator must document 
the date the patient signs the informed consent in the patien t’s medical record. Copies of the signed 
ICF, the si gned patient authorizat ion form (if applicable), and pat ient information sheet (if 
applicable) shall be given to the patient.
All revised ICFs must be reviewed and signed by relevant patients or the relev ant pati ent’s legally 
acceptable representative in the same manner as the original informed consent. The date the 
revised consent was obtained should be recorded in the patient’s medical record, and the patient 
shoul d receive a copy  of the revised ICF.
15.3 Patient Confidentiality
The sponsor and designees affirm and upho ld the principle of the patient’s right to protection 
against invasio n of privacy. Throughout this study , a pati ent’s source data will be linked to the 
sponsor’s clinical study  database or docum entati on only via a unique ident ificat ion number. As 
permitted by all applicable laws and regulat ions, limited patient attributes, such as sex, age, or date 
of birth, and patient initials may be used to verify the pat ient and accuracy  of the pati ent’s unique 
ident ificat ion number.
To com ply with ICH Guidelines for GCP and to verify co mpliance with this protocol, the sponsor 
requi res the investigator to permit its monitor or designee’s monitor, representatives fro m any 
regul atory  authori ty (eg, US FDA, UK MHRA, Japan PMDA), the sponsor’s designated auditors, 
and the appropriate IRBs and IECs to review the patient’s original medical records (source data or 
docum ents) including, but not limited to, laboratory test resul t reports, ECG reports, admissio n and 
discharge summaries for hospital admissions occurring during a patient’s study participat ion, and 
autopsy  reports. Access to a patient’s original medical records requires the specific authorizat ion 
of the pati ent as part of the informed consent process (see Se ction
 15.2).

15.4 Publication, Disclosure, and Clinical Trial Registration Policy
15.4.1 Publication 
The investigator is obliged to provide the sponsor with complete test results and all data derived by 
the invest igator from the study . During and after the study , only  the sponsor m ay make study  
inform ation available to other study  invest igators or to regulatory  agencies, except as required by  
law or regul ation. Except as otherwise allowable in the clinical study  site agreement, any  public 
disclosure (including publicly accessible websites) related to the protocol or study  resul ts, other 
than study  recrui tment m aterials and advert isements, is the sole responsibilit y of the sponsor.
The sponsor ma y publish any data and informat ion fro m the study (including data and informatio n 
generated by  the invest igator) without the consent of the invest igator. Manuscript authorship for 
any peer -reviewed publicat ion will appropriately reflect contribut ions to th e production and 
review of the document. All publicat ions and presentations must be prepared in accordance with 
this secti on and the clinical study  site agreement. In the event of any discrepancy between the 
protocol  and the clinical study  site agreement, the clinical study  site agreement will  prevail.
15.4.2 Clinical Trial Registration
To ensure that information on clinical trials reaches the public in a timely manner and to comply 
with applicable laws, regulations, and guidance, Takeda will, at a minimum, regist er intervent ional 
clinical trials it sponsors anywhere in the world on ClinicalTrials.gov or other publicly accessible 
websites on or before start of study , as defined byTakeda policy / s tandards . Takeda contact 
inform ation, along wi th invest igator’s cit y, state (for Americas investigators), country , and 
recrui ting status will be registered and available for public viewing. 
As needed, Takeda and invest igator/site contact information may be made p ublic to support 
participant access to trials via registries. In certain situations/registries, Takeda may assist 
participants or potential part icipants in finding a clinical trial by  helping them  locate tri al sites 
closest to thei r homes by providing the investigator name, address, and phone number via 
email/phone or other methods preferred by  callers requesting trial informat ion. Once pat ients 
receive invest igator contact informat ion, they may call the site requesting enrollment into the trial. 
The invest igative sites are encouraged to handle the trial inquiries according to their established 
patient screening process. If the caller asks addit ional quest ions beyo nd the topic of trial 
enrollment, they should be referred to the sponsor. 
Any invest igator who objects to Takeda providing this informat ion to callers must provide Takeda 
with a wri tten noti ce request ing that their informat ion not be listed on the registry site.

policy/ standard s, applicable laws, and/or regulat ions. 
Data Sharing
The sponsor is committed to responsible sharing of cl inical data with the goal of advancing 
medical science and improving pat ient care. Qualified independent researchers will be permitted 
to use data collected from pat ients during the study to conduct addit ional scient ific research, which 
may be unrelated to the study  drug or the patient’s disease. The data provided to external 
researchers will not include informat ion that i dentifies pat ients personally.
15.5 Insurance and Compensation for Injury
Each patient in the study  must be insured in accordance with the regul ations applicable to the site 
where the patient is participat ing. If a local underwriter is required, then the sponsor or sponsor’s 
designee will obtain clinical study  insurance against the risk o f injury to clinical study pat ients. 
Refer to the clinical study  site agreement regarding the sponsor’s policy on patient compensation 
and treatment for injury . If the invest igator has questions regarding this po licy, he or she should 
contact the sponsor or sponsor’s designee.

bMedical history  will include smoking/vaping history  and available baseline disease characteristics, such as disease type, sta ging, and PD -L1 expression. Complete 
physical examination (including assessment of the following systems: skin, head, eyes, ears, nose, throat, respiratory, cardiovascular, GI, neurological condition, 
blood and lymphatic, and musculoskeletal) will be collected at screening. The -C1D1 physical examination and medical history are not required if the screening 
physical examination was c onducted and medical history obtained within 3 days before administration of study drug(s). Postscreening physical examinatio ns will 
be symptom -or finding -directed and will be performed predose and at any time point based on clinical need. On dosing days in Cy cle 1, an additional postdose 
physical examination will include an assessment of the respiratory and neurologic systems.
cWeight will be collected at screening and predose on days specified.
d Vital sign measurements (heart rate, blood pressure, temp erature, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation) should be performed as specified and should be performed 
before the first fraction of radiation therapy. During Cycle 1, vital signs will be measured immediately before the start of the pembrolizumab infusion and before the 
start of TAK -676 infusion (within 30 minutes), 30 minutes after start of TAK -676 infusion (±5 minutes), at the EOI (±10 minutes), 2 hours postinfusion (±30 
minutes), any time when clinically indicated including if the patient develops any sig ns or sy mptoms associated with potential risks of TAK -676 and/or 
pembrolizumab, and before discharge (if different from and not overlapping with the timepoints above). 
eECOG performance status should be performed before the first fraction of radiation th erapy.
fSafety ECGs should be performed at screening and C1D1 predose. A qualified person will interpret the ECGs locally. Additional ECGs may be obtained as 
clinically indicated at any time during the study at the discretion of the investigator. When the timing of ECG or vital signs measurements coincides with the timing 
of a blood draw (eg, PK sample), the ECG measurements and vital signs measurements should be completed first, followed by blo od sampling. 
g Radiographic assessments including CT with con trast (or MRI if clinically indicated) of the disease burden will be made at screening/baseline (within 28 days 
before the first dose of radiation) and will be performed to assess disease response using RECIST v.1.1. criteria once at end of Cycle 2 (Day 15 to 22 [predose]), then 
at the end of ever y 3 cycles (Days 15 to 22 [predose]) up to the end of the first year, and then at the end of ever y 6 cycles (+7 days) thereafter until PD or the start of 
alternative therapies. If the patient has had an appropriate CT or MRI scan performed within 28 days of the first dose of radiation, the results of that scan may be 
used for tumor lesion measurements at screening.
hThe radiation must be administered between Day -8 and Day -2with a minimum of 40 hours between the last fraction of radiation and initiation of pembrolizumab . 
Note: There is no Day 0. For more information, refer to Section 8.4.2 .
iHematology, chemistry, thyroid function and C -reactive protein, CPK, and ferritin blood samples for C1D1 may be collected within 3 days before dosing to ensure 
patient eligibility on study Day 1. Repeat baseline chemistry and hematol ogy labs should be obtained on the day of first dose of radiation if more than 2 weeks have 
elapsed between screening labs and the first dose of radiation.

by the investigators and the sponso r.
k Dosing of pembrolizumab will be a minimum 40 hours after the last fraction of radiation. Note: There is no Day 0. 
lA serum or urine pregnancy test will be performed for women of childbearing potential at screening, on Day 1 of each cycle, a nd at the EOT assessment. A serum 
or urine pregnancy test must be performed before the first fraction of radiation therapy or pred ose on C1D1 if no pregnancy test had been performed within the prior 
10 days with negative results available.
mThyroid function tests will be performed at screening, Cycle 1, every other cycle (eg, C3, 5, 7, 9, 11) and EOT.
nUrinalysis samples will be co llected at screening and predose on Day 1 of each cycle and analyzed at the site’s local laboratory.
oPatients enrolling at dose levels of TAK -676 which have been shown to have pharmacodynamic activity in ongoing clinical studies will have mandatory tumor
biopsies performed at screening and on Cycle 1 Days 15 through 21, between 4 and 144 hours post -TAK -676 administration. Tumor biopsies are optional, but 
encouraged from patients enrolling at lower dose levels. The tumor tissue biopsy at screening should b e performed at least 2 days after the last dose of any prior 
antineoplastic therapy and within 3 weeks before the first dose of radiation. Screening biopsy should be performed only when the patient is considered otherwise 
eligible. The tumor biopsies shoul d be performed on a nonirradiated site. Patients with a tumor biopsy obtained less than or equal to 3 months before initiatio n of 
TAK -676 (Day 1), will not be required to undergo a repeat pretreatment biopsy, assuming: 1) adequate tumor tissue is available for analysis (FFPE block preferred) 
and 2) no additional antineoplastic agents were administered since the time of the biopsy.
pPlasma samples to monitor changes in peripheral biomarkers, including cytokines and chemokines should be collected at screeni ng, predose on Day 1 of indicated 
cycles, and during cycle 1 at the additional timepoints specified in Table 2 to monitor effects of TAK -676 on Day 1 and Day 15.
qBlood samples to analyze the presence and changes in immune cell state by immunophenotyping s hould be collected at screening and predose on Day 1 of 
indicated cycles. In cycle 1 only, there arean additional collection sat 6 hours post -EOI of TAK -676 on C1D1 and C1D15 and predose on C1D15 .

TAK -676 administration, not pembrolizumab. The timing of the morning visits should occur at appro ximately the same time as previous dosing days. The date/time 
of the start and end of infusions should be recorded accurately.
bPatients enrolling at dose levels of TAK -676 which have been shown to have pharmacodynamic activity in ongoing clinical studies will have mandatory tumor 
biopsies performed at screening and on Cycle 1 Days 15 through 21, between 4 and 144 hours post -TAK -676 administration. Tumor biopsies are optional but 
encouraged from patients enrolling at lower dose levels. The tumor tissue bio psy at screening should be performed at least 2 days after the last dose of any prior 
antineoplastic therapy and within 3 weeks before the first dose of radiation. Screening biopsy should be performed only when the patient is considered otherwise 
eligible. The tumor biopsies should be performed on a nonirradiated site. Patients with a tumor biopsy obtained less than or equal to 3 months before initiation of 
TAK -676 (Day 1), will not be required to undergo a repeat pretreatment biopsy, assuming: 1) adequate tumor tissue is available for analysis (FFPE block preferred) 
and 2) no additional antineoplastic agents were administered since the time of the biopsy.
cTo be collected from patients only at select centers at screening and on C1D15 predose and C1D15 6 ho urs post dose. Screening sample should be collected only 
when the patient is considered otherwise eligible.
dPK samples are always collected from the contralateral arm (not the same arm as infusion arm).

CONFIDENTIALAppendix EBOIN Design
The Bayesian Optimal INterval (BOIN) design (Liu and Yuan 2015 )will be used to guide the dose 
escalat ion decisio ns and MTD est imation. This trial was designed and will be conducted using the 
software BOIN that is available at www.trialdesign.org. 
The target toxicit y rate is 0.3. During the study , if the observed DLT rate at the current dose is 
≤0.236, the next cohort of patients will be treated at the next higher dose level; if it is ≥0.358, the 
next cohort will be treated at the next lower dose level; if it is wit hin 0.236 and 0.358, addit ional 
patients will be enro lled in this dose level. For the purpose of overdose control, a dose level and all 
the dose l evels above it will be eliminated fro m further examinat ion if its posteri or probabilit y of 
exceeding the target toxicity rate is greater than 0.95. If the lo west d ose level is eliminated, stop the 
escalat ion for safet y. Unless such early stop happens, dose escalation will cont inue unt il the 
maximum sample size is reached, or escalation will be stopped if the number of pat ients treated at 
the current dose reaches 9 a nd the recommendat ion is to retain at the current dose level. The dose 
escalat ion algorithm is described as the fo llowing steps:
Step 1. Patients in the first cohort are treated at lowest dose level.
Step 2. Decide the dose level for the next cohort according to the rule shown in Table 1. Please 
note the fo llowing when using Table 1:
1.“Eliminate” means that the current dose level and all higher dose levels are eliminated to 
prevent treating any  future pati ents at these overly  toxic dose levels.
2.When a dose l evel is eliminated, automat ically de -escalate to the next lower level. When the 
lowest dose l evel is eliminated, stop the dose escalation for safet y. In thi s case, no dose level 
shoul d be selected as the MTD.
3.If none of the actions (ie, escalat ion, de-escalat ion, or eliminat ion) is triggered, the next cohort 
will be treated with the current dose.
4.If the current dose is the lowest dose level and the rule indicates a de -escalation, treat the next 
cohort at the lowest dose level unless the number of DLTs reaches the eliminat ion boundary, at 
which po int the dose escalat ion should be terminated for safet y.
5.If the current dose is the highest dose and the rule indicates an escalat ion, treat the next cohort 
at the highest dose. 
Step 3. Repeat Step 2 un til the maximum sample size is reached or until a certain number of 
patients (n = 9) have already been treated with the current dose level and the recommendat ion is to 
retain at the current dose level.

DLT: dose -limiting toxicity; NA: not applicable.
Number of DLTs is the number of patients with at least 1 DLT.
After the dose escalat ion is complete, the MTD is selected based on isotonic regressio n as 
specified in (Liu and Yuan 2015 ). Specifically , the dose i s selected as the MTD for which the 
isotoni c estimate of the toxicit y rate is closest to the target toxicit y rate. If there are ties, the higher 
dose l evel is selected when the isotonic est imate is lower than the target toxicit y rate; the l ower 
dose l evel is selected when the isotonic est imate is greater than or equal to the target toxicit y rate.
The operating characterist ics of the BOIN design are evaluated with simulat ions assuming various 
distribut ions of toxicit y across dose levels shown in Table 2.

CONFIDENTIALAppendix HResponse Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST Version 1.1)
All sites of  disease, target, and nontarget lesions must be assessed at baseline. Object ive disease 
status is to be recorded at each evaluat ion using the response categories and definit ions provided in 
this secti on.
All sites of  measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesio ns per organ, 5 lesions in total, 
representative of all invo lved organs, shoul d be ident ified as target lesio ns at baseline. Target 
lesions shoul d be selected based on size (longest lesions) and suitabilit y for reproducible repeated 
measurements. Measurements must be provided for target site of measurable lesio ns.
Disease Response Criteria for Target and Nontarget Lesions
Evaluation of Target Lesions
CR: Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or 
nontarget) must have reduction in short axis to <10 mm.
PR: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the LD of target lesions, taking as reference the 
baseline sum LD.
PD: At least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD of target lesions, taking as reference the 
smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of 1 or more new 
lesions. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an 
absolute increase of at least 5 mm.
SD: Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, 
taking as reference the smallest sum LD since the treatment started.
Evaluation of Nontarget Lesions
CR: Disappearance of all nontarget lesions and normalization of tumor marker level. All 
lymph nodes must be non -pathological in size (<10 mm short axis).
Non-CR/Non -PD: Persistence of 1 or more nontarget lesion(s) or/and maintenance of tumor marker level 
above the normal limits.
PD: Unequivocal progression of existing non -target lesions. (Note: the appearance of 1 or 
more new lesions is also considered progression).
Source: (Eisenhauer et al. 2009 ). 
CR: complete response; LD: longest diameter; PD: progressive disease; PR: partial response; SD: stable disease.

Special Allowances to RECIST v.1.1 : As described in Section 9.4.14.1 , accumulat ing evidence 
indicates a minorit y of patients treated with immunotherapy  may derive clinical benefit despite 
initial evidence of PD. Patients will be permitted to continue study treatment beyond init ial 
RECIST v.1.1 defined PD as long as they me et the cri teria outlined in Sect ion 9.4.14.1 . All 
decisio ns to continue treatment beyo nd init ial progressio n must be discussed wit h the medical 
monitor and documented in the study  records.

CONFIDENTIALAppendix KStatistical Considerations for Paired Biopsies
While biopsies are requested of all pat ients with safely  accessible nonirradiated/abscopal lesions 
(in the opi nion of the invest igator), safely accessible biopsies will become ma ndatory  once 
evidence of peripheral immune act ivation is observed during dose escalat ion. Pending successful 
completion of the dose escalat ion phase o f the study, it is ant icipated that addit ional pat ients will 
be evaluated in future dose expansion. In the future dose expansio n cohort, we hope to demonstrate
abiologically and statist ically meaningful increase of T -cell infiltrat ion into tumors after treatm ent 
of TAK -676 + pembrolizumab + radiation. A certain number of paired patient biopsies (fro m a 
single indicati on and dose level) in the escalat ion and expansio n cohorts may be needed to achieve 
our desired statist ical confidence. To evaluate that, we surveyed the literature for the level o f T-cell 
infiltrat ion into tumors treated with immune onco logy agen ts in various tumor types (Chalabi et al. 
2020; Ferrarotto et al. 2020 ; Steel e et al. 2018 ; Tumeh et al. 2014 ). Evaluat ion of published results 
suggest that CPItreatm ent-mediated T -cell infiltration can resul t in approximately 1.5
-to 3-fold 
increas es in CD8 T cells wit hin the tumor microenviroment via the evaluation of pretreatment and 
posttreatment biopsies and yields an est imated coefficient of variat ion of 80% to 180% in majorit y 
of the studi es. On the basis o fthese data, we assumed a 2.5
-fold increase and a coefficient of 
variat ionof 130% to project the minimum number of paired biopsies that are needed to achieve a 
0.8 posterior probabilit y of achieving a 1.5 -fold increase in T cells aftertreatm ent,with a 
probabilit y of success of 80%. On the basis o fthese assumptions, we projected that 11 pairs of 
high qualit y and interpretable biopsies are needed. The total number of patients biopsied within an 
indicat ion needed to support this statist ical goal is expected to be greater than 11 patients and will 
be based on biopsy qualit y and interpretabilit y (refer to Stati stical Analysis Plan for addit ional 
details).

1 Section 2.0 STUDY SUMMARY
Secondary Objectives
Section 5.1.2 Secondary ObjectivesIn the objective describing antitumor 
activity , replaced the term “abscopal 
effect” with “nonirradiated lesions.”Updated text 
throughout protocol 
from “abscopal” to 
“nonirra diated” and 
from “local” to 
“irradiated” for a more 
accurate description, 
since patients are also 
being treated with 
systemic therapies as 
opposed to just 
radiation therapy.

established standard of care (SOC) 
treatment options for which they were 
eligible in addition to having
progressed on checkpoint inhibitors 
in a prior line of therapy. Clarification to address

Section 5.2.2 Secondary Endpoints
Table 6.b Primary and Sec ondary  
Endpoints for DisclosuresRenamed response assessments to 
replace “local” or “localized” with 
“irradiated” and to replace “abscopal” 
with “no nirradiated” as follows: 
irradiated response rate 
(ORRirradiated); nonirradiated 
response rate (ORRnonirradi ated); 
confirmed complete response 
(cCRirradiated) and confirmed partial 
response (cPRirradiated) of tumor 
lesions ly ing within the radiation 
field; confirmed complete response 
(cCRnonirradiated) and confirmed 
partial response (cPRnonirradiated) 
of tumor l esions lying outside of the 
radiation field; duration of response 
for tumors lying within the radiation 
field (DORirradiated) and for those 
lying outside of the radiation field 
(DORnonirradiated); and time to 
response for tumors lying within the 
radiation field (TTRirradiated), and 
for those lying outside of the 
radiation field (TTRnonirradiated).Since patients are 
being treated with 
systemic therapies, 
changed “abscopal” to 
“nonirradiated” and 
“local” to “irradiated” 
for a more accurate 
description.

However, if no DLTs have been 
identified in the TAK -676 + 
pembrolizumab dose level that has 
already  been evaluated in the 
dose-finding phase 1 TAK -676-1002 
study, the sponsor, in agreement with 
the TAK -676-1003 investigators, 
may opt to enroll a 2 -patient cohort at 
that same [radiation] + TAK -676 + 
pembrolizumab dose level being 
evaluated in the TAK -676-1003 
study.Clarification of dose 
escalation procedures.

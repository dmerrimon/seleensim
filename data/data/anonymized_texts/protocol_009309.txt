2.0		BACKGROUND 	
 Bone marrow transplantation (BMT) is a standard treatment option for an increasing number of malignant and non-malignant disorders.  To reconstitute hematopoiesis after an intensive myeloablative therapy, the transplantation of plur ipotential hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) is 
required.  Such HSCs are typically  recovered from the bone marrow of  related or unrelated donors or 
the bone marrow or apheresed peripheral blood of the patients themselves [1].  Unfortunately, suitable marrow is frequently not available [2].  E ither the patient's own marrow is contaminated with 
tumor cells or potential allogeneic marrow donors are unsuitable most often on the basis of HLA mismatch.   Human umbilical cord blood (UCB) is an alternative source of HSCs that is capable of 
reconstituting hematopoiesis  after intensive myeloa blative therapy [3-10]. 
 
2.1  Umbilical Cord Blood Transplantation (UBCT)  
As a result of the early successes with umbilical  cord blood transplantation (UCBT) from sibling 
donors, pilot programs for the bank ing of unrelated donor UCB were  initiated in many countries 
around the world.  Known benefits of banked UCB in clude: 1) rapid availability, 2) absence of donor 
risk, 3) absence of donor attrition, an d 4) very low risk of transmissi ble infectious diseases, such as 
CMV and EBV, and 5) low risk of acute GVHD despite HLA mismatch.  UCB is particularly 
beneficial for patients of ethnic and racial minority descent for whom adult marrow and blood donors 
often cannot be identified.

2.2.1 Single Unit UCBT  [11].   
Between 1994 and 2001, 102 consecutive patients (m edian age 7.4 years) received a single, 
unrelated UCB unit after a myeloablative condi tioning for malignant (n  = 65; 68% high-risk) 
and non-malignant diseases (n = 37).  Me dian infused cell dose of UCB was 3.1 x 107 NC/kg 
(range 0.7-57.9), and 2.8 x 105 CD34+ cells/kg (range 0.4-39.1) .  Fourteen percent had an 
HLA matched unit and 86% had a 1-3 HLA-match.  Neutrophil recovery occurred at a median 
of 23 days (range 9-54) after UCBT with cumu lative incidence of engraftment of 88% (95% 
CI: 81-95) by day 42. Speed and likelihood of ne utrophil recovery were  strongly associated 
with cell dose, with markedly inferior engraftm ent (72% at a median of 34 days) in patients 
receiving a CD34+ cell dose <1.7 x 105 cells/kg.  
 
The incidences of grade II-IV  and III-IV acute GVHD were 39% (95% CI: 29-49) and 11% 
(95% CI: 5-17), respectively, at day 100, with 10%  (95% CI: 4-14) of patients having chronic 
GVHD at 1 year. One year transplant-related mortality (TRM) was 30% (95% CI: 21-39) which was strongly associated with CD34+ ce ll dose.  The probabilities of 1 and 2-year 
survival were 58% (95% CI: 49-70) and 47% (9 5% CI: 36-57), respectively.  Importantly, 
with a graft cell dose >1.7 x 10
5 CD34+ cells/kg, survival was 70%  (95% CI: 49-90) at 1 year. 
 
The principal conclusions of  this study were: 1) an adequate cell dose (>1.7 x 105 CD34+ 
cells/kg or >2.5 x 107 nucleated cells/kg) consistently engraft; 2) GVHD is low despite HLA 
mismatch;  3) survival and risk of relapse are co mparable to that observed after BMT,  and; 4) 
cell dose significantly limits the applicability of UCB, particularly in adult size recipients. 
 2.2.2  Multi-Unit UCBT  [12].   
Since cell dose has been cl early identified as a major limitation, often preventing the 
consideration of UCB for adult recipients, we have explored the possibility of infusing two partially HLA matched units to augment cell dose.  Between 2000 and 2005, we have increasingly utilized two UCB un its rather than one, particular ly in adults and adolescents 
who cannot find a suitable single UCB unit.  The underlying hypothesis of the original study 
(MT2000-15) was that the addition of the second  unit would enhance the engraftment and the 
speed of hematopoietic recovery.  We have analyzed of the results in the firs t 31 adult and adolescent patients [median age 24 
years (range: 13-53); median weight 73 kg (range: 48-120)] with high-risk hematologic malignancy who were transplanted with tw o partially HLA-matched UCB units after a 
myeloablative conditioning. Patient brea kdown by diagnosis was: acute myelogenous 
leukemia (AML, n=15), acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL, n=12), chronic myelogenous 
leukemia (CML, n=3) and non-Hodgkin Lymphoma  (NHL, n=1). The median total infused 
dose 3.7 x 10
7 nucleated cells per kilogr am (range 1.1-6.3) and 4.9 x 105 CD34 per kilogram 
(range, 0.9-14.5).  In this study, 100% of evaluable patients (i.e ., survived for 21 days [n=29]) engrafted at a 
median of 23 days (range 14-41).  This compares favorably with a 65-75% incidence of engraftment reported for adults [9, 10].  In each case, one unit predominated.  Thus far, no

 February 6, 2013     Page 9 of 26   CPRC #2005LS043   factor (nucleated cell dose, CD 34+ cell dose, HLA-match, ABO, sex, order infusion) predicts 
which unit will eventually be responsible for long term marrow recovery. The incidence of 
platelet recovery (>50,000/uL) was 73% (95% CI, 51- 95) at day 180. Incidence of grades II-
IV and III-IV acute graft-versus-host dise ase (GVHD) was 65% (95% CI, 42-88) and 17% 
(95% CI, 2-32) at day 100.  Disease-free surv ival remains 72% at 1 year for patients 
transplanted in CR with no relapse in this cohort (median follow up: 1.2 years). 
 
These data indicate that: 1) double unit UCBT is safe in terms of engraftment (bi-directional 
immune rejection between the uni ts was never observed);  2) one unit always predominates 
within the first 100 days;  3) >90% of adults will be able to identify two units that are partially 
HLA matched with the patient and each other;  4) incidence GVHD is similar to that observed 
after single UCBT; and  5) surviv al exceeds that of historical data with a single UCB unit.    
 As a result of these promising early data, we plan  to extend this trial in order to 1) confirm the 
initial observations and 2) establish survival outcomes and relapse risk for individual disease 
groups.

2/day IV x 3 days, total dose 75 mg/m2 (days –8 to –6)  
 
6.2.2 Cyclophosphamide   
 
Cyclophosphamide will be administered as a 2 hour intravenous infusion with a high volume 
fluid flush and mesna per institutiona l guidelines on days -7 and -6.  
 Cyclophosphamide 60mg/kg/day IV x 2 days , total dose 120 mg/kg (days –7 and –6) 
 Dosing is calculated based on Actual Body Weight (ABW) unless ABW > 30 kg above Ideal 
Body Weight (IBW), in which case the dose should  be computed using adjusted body weight. 
Ideal body weight is calculated using Devine's formula or per institutional gui delines: 50 kg + 
(2.3 kg x (height in inches - 60)) for men; 45.5 kg + (2.3 kg x (height in  inches - 60)) for 
women. Adjusted body weight  = IBW + 0.5(ABW - IBW) 
 
6.2.3 Total Body Irradiation (TBI)  
 
The recommended TBI is 165 cGy given twice daily for a total dose of 1320 cGy (days -4 to –1).  Recommended TBI Guidelines are describe d in Appendix III. TBI may be delivered by 
local guidelines provided the effective dose is equivalent to what is recommended in the TBI 
Guidelines.    
 
6.3 Immunosuppressive Therapies 
 
All patients will receive GVHD prophylaxis with 2 drugs as follows:  
6.3.1 Cyclosporine (CSA) 
Cyclosporine A (CSA) will start day -3 and wi ll be administered PO/IV maintaining a trough 
level between 200 and 400 ng/mL. For adults the initial dose will be 2.5 mg/kg IV over 1 hour 
every 12 hours. For children < 40 kg the initial dose will be 2.5 mg/kg IV over 1 hour every 8 
hours.  CSA dosing will be monitored and altered as clin ically appropriate per institutional pharmacy 
guidelines.  Dose adjustments will be made on the basis of toxicity and/or low CSA levels.  
 Patients will receive CSA until day +100.  If no GVHD, the dose will be tapered 10% per 
week beginning on day 101, to discon tinue at approximately day +180.

 February 6, 2013     Page 14 of 26   CPRC #2005LS043   6.3.2 Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) 
 
Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) 3 gram/day IV/PO for patients who are ≥ 40 kg divided in 2 
or 3 doses. Pediatric patient (<40 kilograms) w ill receive MMF at the dose of 15 mg/kg/dose 
every 8 hours beginning day -3.  MMF dosing will  be monitored and altered as clinically 
appropriate based on institutional guidelines.  Patients will be eligible for MMF dosing and 
pharmacokinetics studies.  Stop MMF at day +30 or  7 days after engraftment, whichever day is later, if no acute GVHD. 
(Definition of engraftment is 1
st day of 3 consecutive days of absolute neutrophil count 
[ANC] > 0.5 x 109 /L).  
 If no donor engraftment, do not stop MMF.  If  no evidence of donor engraftment on the day 
+21 bone marrow biopsy, notify URD search coor dinator to pursue back -up UCB and arrange 
day +28 bone marrow biopsy per current inst itutional slow engraf tment guidelines. 
 If the patient has acute GVHD requiring systemic  therapy, MMF may be stopped 7 days after 
initiation of systemic therapy for acute GVHD.  
 
6.4 Umbilical Cord Blood Transplantation (UCBT) 
 
Cord blood products are thawed and filtered ( 170-micron) in the Molecular and Cellular 
Therapeutics (MCT) Lab using the method of Rubinstein et al.  
 
Infusion will be per current institutional policie s.  The infusion of the first UCB unit should 
begin within 15 minutes, and no later than 30 minut es after arrival on the Unit.  If 2 units are 
used, both cords will be infused within 30-60 minutes of each other as deemed clinically safe 
by the BMT attending or designee.   
6.5 Growth Factor   
 
All patients will receive G-C SF 5 mcg/kg/day IV (dose rounded to vial size) based on the 
actual body weight IV beginning on day +1 after UCB infusion.  G-CSF will be administered 
daily until the ANC exceeds 2.5 x 10
9/L for three consecutive days and then discontinued.  If 
the ANC decreases to <1.0 x 109/L, G-CSF will be reinstituted.

9.0		ADVERSE 	EVENT	MONITORING 	and	REPORTING 	
 
Toxicity and adverse events will be classified  according to NCI's Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events V 3.0 (CTCAE) and reported on the sc hedule below.   A copy of the CTCAE can be 
downloaded from the CTEP home page http ://www.eortc.be/services/doc/ctc/ctcaev3.pdf 
9.1 Definitions  
The following definitions are based on the Code  of Federal Regulations Title 21 Part 312.32 
(21CFR312.32(a)). 
  
MT2005-10: UCBT Using A Myeloablative Prep    
              
 February 6, 2013     Page 19 of 26   CPRC #2005LS043   Adverse Event:   Any untoward medical occurrence asso ciated with the use of a drug in 
humans, whether or not c onsidered drug related.  
 
Suspected Adverse Reaction:  Any adverse event for which th ere is a reasonable possibility 
that the drug caused the adverse event.   Life-Threatening Adverse Event Or Life-T hreatening Suspected Adverse Reaction:  An 
adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is cons idered “life-threatening”  if, in the view of 
either the investigator or sponsor, its occurrence places the patient or subject at immediate risk 
of death. 
   
Serious Adverse Event Or Serious Suspected Adverse Reaction:  An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is consid ered “serious” if, in the view of either the investigator or 
sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes:  
 Death 
 A life-threatening adverse event 
 Inpatient hospitalization or prol ongation of existing hospitalization 
 A persistent or significant in capacity or substantial disrup tion of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions 
 A congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
 Unanticipated (unexpected) problems/events  as defined by the University Of Minnesota 
IRB are those that are not already described as potential risks in the consent form, not listed in 
the Investigator’s Brochure or not  part of an underlying disease. 
 
Event Attribution Categories: 
CTCAE does not define an AE as necessarily  ‘caused by a therapeutic intervention.’ The 
clinical investigator must assign attribution for an adverse ev ent after naming and grading of 
the event. 
 
Attribution Description 
Unrelated The AE is clearly NOT related to the intervention 
Unlikely The AE is doubtfully related to the intervention Possible The AE may be related to the intervention Probable The AE is likely related to the intervention Definite The AE is clearly re lated to the intervention   
 
UPIRTSO: Federal regulations [45CFR46.103(b)(5 ) and 21CFR56.108(b)(1)] require the 
IRB to ensure that researchers promptly repor t “any unanticipated prob lems involving risk to 
subjects or others” (UPIRTSOs).  The University of Minnesota IRB defines a UPIRTSO as any problem or event which in the opinion of the local researcher wa s unanticipated, reflects 
new or increased risk to the subjects and at le ast possibly related to th e research procedures.  
 In addition, the IRB has defined the following problems/events as reportable within 10 
working days using the UPRITSO form found on the IRB website: 
MT2005-10: UCBT Using A Myeloablative Prep    
              
 February 6, 2013     Page 20 of 26   CPRC #2005LS043    Any accidental or unintentional change to the IRB-approved protocol that increases 
risk or has the potential to recur  
 Any deviation from the protocol taken without  prior IRB review to eliminate apparent 
immediate hazard to a research subject  
 Any publication in the literature, safety m onitoring report (including Data and Safety 
Monitoring Reports), interim result or othe r finding that indica tes an unexpected 
change to the risk/benefit ratio of the research  
 Any breach in confidentiality that may i nvolve risk to the subject or others  
 Any complaint of a subject that cannot be resolved by the research staff  
 Any other possibly related event which in the opinion of the investig ator constitutes an 
unanticipated risk  
 
Expedited (Rapid) Reporting:  Certain events may require rapid notification to entities 
providing patient safety oversight (e.g. IRB) as detailed in section 9.2.  For the IRB this is 10 
working days.   
 
9.2 Adverse Event Monitoring  
All subjects will be monitored from the initia tion of any study treatment through day 100 as it 
is expected that most serious adverse events will occur during this period.   
 After day 100, monitoring for adverse events wi ll become less frequent based on the schedule 
in section 7.0.  However, the investigator is obligated, upon knowledge of, to report any event meeting the definition of UPIRTSO and re quires expedited reporting per section 9.3. 
 
9.3 Required Reporting  
The reporting period for this study is from in itiation of any study treatment through day +100; 
however after day +100, the investigator must report upon knowledge any study treatment 
related event meeting the expedi ted reporting criteria below. 
 
The SAE Coordinator will provid e the Cancer Center’s Data and Safety Monitoring Council

11.0  STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
 
11.1 Objectives 
 
11.1.1 Primary objective 
The principal aim of this study is to estimate one year overall survival of UCBT after a 
myeloablative preparative regimen for the combined experience of single unit UCB 
transplants and double unit UCB transplants.  
11.1.2 Secondary objectives 
 the incidence of transplant-related mortality (TRM) at 6 months after UCBT 
 the pattern of chimerism at multip le time points after double UCBT 
 the incidence of neutrophil engraftment at day 42 after UCBT  
 the incidence of platelet engr aftment at 1 year after UCBT 
 the incidence of acute graf t-versus-host disease (GVHD)  grade II-IV and grade III-
IV at day 100 after UCBT 
 the incidence of chronic GVHD at 1 year after UCBT  
 the disease free survival at 1 and 2 years after UCBT  
 the incidence relapse at 1 and 2 years after UCB T  
 
11.2 Statistical Analysis 
Survival and progression-free survival will be estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Non-relapse 
mortality, relapse, neutrophil and platelet engraf tment, acute and chronic GvHD will be estimated by 
cumulative incidence using competing risk methods. 95% confidence intervals will be used to show 
precision for the estimates. 
MT2005-10: UCBT Using A Myeloablative Prep    
              
 February 6, 2013     Page 22 of 26   CPRC #2005LS043    
In order to show that survival  after double unit UCB tr ansplants are no worse than single unit UCB 
transplants, a non-inferiority test will be pe rformed. The null and alternative hypotheses will be: 
 
Ho: 1 year survival for double UCB ≤ 1 year survival for single UCB – 0.2 (20%) 
Ha: 1 year survival for double UCB  1 year survival for single UCB – 0.2 (20%) 
 Comparison of the single UCB cohort will be made to a historical  cohort using a superiority test. 
 
H
o: 1 year survival for new cohort = 1 year survival for old cohort 
Ha: 1 year survival for new cohort > 1 year survival for old cohort by at least 0.2(20%) 
 For inferences of 1 year survival among patients that have been followed for at least 1 year, 
comparisons will be made by a normalized Z-test for non-inferiority. A Chi-square test will be used for the superiority comparison. Comparisons in wh ich patients have not been followed for the 
complete follow-up period will be completed by the Log-rank test. Univariate comparisons of factors other than the number of units will be stratified by the number of units. Cox regression will be utilized to correct for any potential confounders.   
11.3 Rationale for Sample Size 
In order to achieve a precise estimate of the probab ility of survival at one year post transplant we 
would like to have an estimate of survival with a 95% confidence in terval that has a band width of 
less than 0.10. We expect to enroll approximately  300 patients over the 10 year study period. We will 
also be able to use 40 patients from the pr evious study using this same conditioning regimen. 
Assuming that the proportion surviving at one year is 65%, the 95% confidence interval should have 
a band width of approximately 0.08. This is assuming that there are no patients lost to follow-up and 
that all patients have been followed for at least on e year post transplant at the time of analysis.  
 
Based on the accrual goal of 300 patients, the equivale nce test will have a power of 97% and a type I 
error of 5%. The superiority test will have a power of 83% and a type I error of 5%. 
 
We expect 50% to be double unit UCBT.   
11.4 Gender and Ethnicities Statement  
This study is open to both males and females and to all racial/ethnic groups. The patient enrollment 
pattern is expected to be similar to that of other hematological maligna ncy studies. It is not 
anticipated that the outcome will be affected by either race or gender.  The study will not have 
separate accrual targets for different subgroups.  
 
12.0 RECORDS RETENTION 
 The investigator will retain study records, including source data, copies of CRF’s and all study correspondence in a secure facility for at least 6 years af ter the study file has b een closed with the

Patients will be considered evaluable acute GVHD if  they demonstrate donor cell engraftment and 
survive to day 28.  Organ involvement will be staged using the criteria outlined in the table below.  
Biopsy of each organ site at diagnosis or major ch ange in disease activity will be performed unless 
clinical circumstances make it impossible.  Consensus Clinical Stage and Grade of Acute GVHD (Przepiorka et al, 1995) 
Stage Skin Liver Lower 
Gastrointestinal Tract Upper Gastrointestinal Tract 
1 Maculopapular rash <25% of body surface Bilirubin 2.0 – 3.0 mg/dl Diarrhea 500 – 1000 mL/day or 280 – 555 mL/m
2 No protracted nausea and vomiting 
2 Maculopapular rash 25-50% body surface Bilirubin 3.1 – 6.0 mg/dl Diarrhea 1000 – 1500 mL/day or 556 – 833 mL/m
2 Persistent nausea, vomiting or anorexia
3 Generalized erythroderma Bilirubin 6.1 – 15.0 mg/dl Diarrhea >1500 mL/day or    >833 mL/m
2  
4 Generalized erythroderma with bullous formation and desquamation Bilirubin > 15 mg/dl Severe abdominal pain, with or without ileus, or stool with frank blood or melena  
 
Grading for Treatment Criteria 
 
Mild GVHD = Skin stage I-II only (E quivalent to Seattle Grade I). 
 Moderate GVHD = Skin stage I-III and/or liver I-IV and/or Gastrointestinal tract (GI)   I-III and/or 
Upper GI (UGI).  (Equivalent to Seattle Grade II, III).  Severe GVHD = Any stage IV along w ith severe clinical illness. 
 Patients progressing during initial th erapy or not improving sufficiently after 2 courses of therapy are 
to be treated as severe GVHD.  
Acute GVHD treatment may be by institutional guidelines. The recommended treatment for patients 
demonstrating moderate or severe GVHD (Grade II- IV) is methylprednisol one at 48 mg/m2/day or 
prednisone 60 mg/m2/day followed by a taper which starts a day 8 of acute GVHD therapy.  If there 
is no response in 7 days or there is progressi on of the disease, ATG 15 mg/kg every 12 hours for 5 
days will be added.

Fractionated Total Body Irradiation (In Lateral Position): 
 
1320 cGy administered in an 8 fractions of 165 cG y each with 2 fractions being given each day. 
 
Total body irradiation is given at a dose rate of 10-19 cGy/minute pr escribed to the midplane of the 
patient at the level of the umbilicus.  The total body irradiation will be delivered with right and left lateral fields, with the patient supine on 
a specially designed couch.  Based on measurements of transverse thicknesses, aluminum compensators will be used to ensure that the dose homogeneity across the field is within 10 % of the pres cribed dose.  Usually head/neck, 
leg and lung compensators are used (although ba sed on calculated mid-mediastinal doses, lung 
compensators are often not needed).  Total body irradiation will be delivered with a lin ear accelerator using 6, 18, 24 MeV X-rays.  The 
energy used will be based on the calculated dose to the midline at points up and down the patient's torso.  The lowest energy that gives 90-100% of the prescription point dose will be used. 
 A beam "spoiler" will be used to ensure a full skin dose.  Half value layer lung and kidney blocks will not be utilized. 
 Testicular boosts should be used for all males wi th ALL (and according to institutional practice for 
other diseases).  The testicular boost is given in a single 400 cGy fraction with either electrons 
prescribed to Dmax or photons prescribed to the mi dplane of the scrotum.  If  electrons are used, the 
energy for the testicular boost depends on the thickness of the testicles and is chosen so that the D90 
corresponds > to the posterior surface of  the scrotum.

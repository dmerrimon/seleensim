1. OBJ ECTIVES  
 
 
1.1 Study Design  
 
This is a 2 -arm, randomized, double -blinded multi -center phase II trial to estimate the 
cumulative incidence of venous thromboembolic events  (VTE)  and major hemorrhage in 
hospitalized cancer patients receiving enoxaparin thromboprop hylaxis. Hospitalized cancer 
patients  considered  to be at  high risk of thro mbosis (based on malignancy diagnosis  and Padua 
risk factors) will be randomized to standard dose enoxaparin daily versus wei ght-adjusted 
enoxaparin  daily for up to 14 days.  
 
1.2 Prima ry Objectives  
 The primary objectives of the study are to estimate the cumulative incidence  of VTE and 
major hemorrhage in hospitalized cancer patients receiving standard dose or weight -
adjusted  enoxaparin.  
 
1.3 Exploratory Objectives  
 Compare rates of symptoma tic VTE  between enoxaparin arms  at day 14  
 Evaluate the performance of clinical scoring models (ie. Padua, IMPROVE, and Khorana  
Score ) in predicting thrombotic risk in hospitalized cancer patients  
 Assess the prognostic value of biomarkers (e.g. D -dimer and  microparticles) to predict 
thrombosis in hospitalized cancer patients  
 
2. BACKGROUND  
 
2.1 Study Disease (s) 
 
Venous thromboembolism is estimated to account for up to 5% of all deaths during 
hospitalization. [1] Recog nizing the burden on healthcare and the preventable nature of venous 
thromboembolic events during hospitalization, U.S. Government agencies are working to 
improve the rates of prescribed thromboprophylaxis. The Agency for Healthcare Research and 
Quality id entified thromboprophylaxis as the number one patient safety practice [2], the Surgeon 
General issued a Call to Action [3], and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services is 
targeting hospital thr omboprophylaxis in a national health -care quality initiative. Major 
professional organizations including the American Society of Clinical Oncology, National 
Comprehensive Cancer Network, American College of Chest Physicians, and European Society 
of Medical  Oncology have all issued strong recommendations for the prescription of 
pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis of hospitalized cancer patients. [4-7] And yet, despite the 
association between cancer -thrombosis and increase d in-hospital cancer mortality, the absolute 
benefit, toxicity and even appropriate dosing of routine thromboprophylaxis in cancer patients is 
unknown.  In the three phase III registration trials comparing low molecular weight heparins with 
placebo in hospi talized medical patients, only 6% of patients carried a diagnosis of cancer and 
there was no statistical benefit for thromboprophylaxis in the subgroup analysis of cancer 
patients included in these trials. [8] This p hase II trial will establish point estimates on the risk of 
DF/HCC Protocol #:  15-547 
Protocol Version Date:  08.28.18 
6 VTE and hemorrhage in preparation for  a planned phase III clinical trial to assess the risks and 
benefits of anticoagulation in cancer patients at increased  risk for thrombosis .  
 
Risk factors for  thrombosis in hospitalized cancer patients    
In analysis of a large hospital discharge database that included over 1 million cancer patients, the 
overall incidence of venous thromboembolic events (VTE) was 4.1% per hospitalization with 
considerable varia tion according to presence of concomitant thrombotic risk factors. [9]  For 
instance, in 26,118 patients with pan creatic cancer the rate of VTE was 8.1% per hospitalization 
whereas the rate was 1.4% in the 50,898 patients with head and neck malignancy. Other higher 
risk tumors included ovary (5.6% rate of VTE), lung (5.1%), stomach (4.9%), and non -Hodgkin 
lymphoma (4 .6%). Independent risk factors for thrombosis during hospitalization included 
primary site of cancer, age, chemotherapy, and comorbidities (e.g. infection, pulmonary, renal 
disease).  
 
Prediction models have been developed to identify which populations of hospitalized patients are 
at highest risk of thrombosis but these have not been specifically developed for hospitalized 
cancer populations. In the widely cited Padua Prediction Score, independent risk factors for VTE 
include cancer, prior history of VTE, r educed mobility, hereditary thrombophilia, recent surgery 
or trauma, obesity, elderly, and comorbidities (e.g. infection, acute coronary syndrome, 
respiratory failure). [10] Among the 659 low risk patients (Padua Sco re of <4) not receiving 
pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis, only one patient (0.2%) was diagnosed with VTE during 
hospitalization. By comparison, the rate of thrombosis was 7.5% among the 469 high -risk 
patients (Padua Score > 4).  
 
Risk -benefit assessment fo r thromboprophylaxis for hospitalized cancer patients  
In a recent  systematic review and meta -analysis of cancer patients enrolled in randomized phase 
III clinical trials. [8] Only 307 cancer patients were enrolled am ong the three major registration 
clinical trials involving low molecular weight heparins (or fondaparinux) versus placebo. The 
pooled relative risk of VTE was 0.91 (95% CI, 0.21 -4.0) with two trials demonstrating a non -
significant reduction of thrombosis i n cancer patients while the third trial demonstrated a 
statistically significant increase in thrombosis in patients receiving thrombopropylaxis with 
fondaparinux. Fondaparinux has been shown previously in randomized clinical trials to prevent 
thrombosis fo llowing cancer surgery and thus these results are unlikely to point simply to the 
ineffectiveness of a single thromboprophylactic agent. In all studies the incidence of thrombosis 
was higher in the cancer subgroup receiving thromboprophylaxis compared with  non-cancer 
patients. It is evident that anywhere from 1 in 5 to 1 in 20 hospitalized cancer patients are 
diagnosed with VTE despite receiving recommended thromboprophylaxis.  
 
2.2 Study Agent (Enoxaparin)  
 
Enoxaparin is a low molecular weight heparin with ant ithrombotic properties approved by the 
Federal Drug Administration for prevention of deep vein thrombosis following abdominal or 
orthopedic surgery and in medical patients with restricted mobility during acute illness.  
 
Enoxaparin administered subcutaneous ly achieves steady -state activity levels predicted by 
single -dose pharmacokinetics. After repeated subcutaneous administration of 40mg once daily, 
DF/HCC Protocol #:  15-547 
Protocol Version Date:  08.28.18 
7 the steady state is reached on day 2 with an average exposure ratio of 15% higher than after a 
single dose. E noxaparin is primarily metabolized in the liver by desulfation and/or 
depolymerization to lower molecular weight species with much reduced biological potency. 
Renal clearance of active fragments represents about 10% of the administered dose and total 
renal  excretion of active and non -active fragments 40% of the dose. In the elderly, the apparent 
clearance of enoxaparin following multiple subcutaneous doses is similar to younger subjects. A 
linear relationship exists between activity and creatinine clearance .  
 
Standard dose e noxaparin for thromboprophylaxis in medical patients:  
In a double blind multicenter parallel group study, enoxaparin at 20mg or 40mg once a day for 
14 days was compared to placebo in medical patients with severely restricted mobility. [11] 
Patients were enrolled with the following diagnosis: congestive heart failure (NYHA class III or 
IV), acute respiratory failure or complicated chronic respiratory insufficiency, acute infection, or 
acute rheumati c disorder. A total of 1073 patients were treated on the study for a maximum of 14 
days (median 7 days). Enoxaparin administered at 40mg once daily was associated with a 
significant reduction in thromboembolic events compared with placebo (5.5 vs 14.9, P<. 001). 
The lower (20mg) dose of enoxaparin was not associated with a reduction in thromboembolic 
events (12.2%). Enoxaparin (40mg) was well tolerated with 6 of 360 patients suffering a major 
hemorrhagic event compared with 4 of 362 treated with placebo. The re were 8 cases of 
thrombocytopenia in the placebo group and 2 in the enoxaparin (40mg) treated group. There 
were no significant differences in the groups for any other adverse outcomes.    
 
Modified dose enoxaparin thromboprophylaxis in cancer patients.  
The pharmacokinetic profile of low molecular weight heparins are known to be dependent on 
body weight. [12] Compared with fixed dose enoxaparin at 40mg, weight adjusted dose of 
enoxaparin of 1mg/kg yields significantly greater peak anti -Xa activity, anti -IIa activity and 
inhibition of thrombin generation. [12, 13]    Notably, there is randomized trial data to support the 
safety and efficacy of enoxaparin at 1mg/kg daily for thromboprophylaxis in cancer patients. The 
CONKO -004 trial randomized over 300 patients with advanced pancreatic cancer to 
chemotherapy  alone or chemotherapy with enoxaparin 1mg/kg daily for 3 months. At 3 months, 
they observed an approximate 85% risk reduction in the incidence of VTE in the arm 
randomized to intermediate dose enoxaparin (P=0.001) without an increase in major hemorrhage 
(P=1.0). [14] 
 
2.3 Rationale  
 
Based on the av ailable evidence , it is apparent that an accurate assessment of risk versus benefit 
for primary thromboprophylaxis of hospitalized cancer patients is not possible. It is also evident 
that hospitalized cancer patients commonly receive pharmacologic thrombop rophylaxis without 
attention to the presence or absence of thrombotic risk factors. In highest risk cancer patients, 
current pharmacologic regimens are inadequate with as many as 20% patients suffering from 
thromboembolic events.  The principle goals of thi s phase II  clinical trial are to establish  a more 
accurate point estimate of rate of VTE in high risk cancer patients receiving standard, fixed -dose 
low molecular weight  heparin thromboprophylaxis and to develop a point estimate of 
hemorrhage using interme diate -dose enoxaparin prophylaxis in higher risk patient s.

2.4 Correlative Studies Background  
 
Evaluation of Padua, IMPROVE, and Khorana risk models in hospitalized cancer patients.  
Published risk models have been developed to identify a collective group of  risk factors that 
identify patient populations considered to be at sufficiently high risk of thrombosis to warrant 
thromboprophylaxis. The IMPROVE scoring model was developed using a database of 15,000 
patients from 12 countries.  A multiple regression an alysis identified independent risk factors for 
VTE in acutely ill hospitalized medical patients. [15] The incidence of thrombosis following 
hospitalization was 11% in patients with IMPROVE scores >5. The four indepen dent risk factors 
at admission comprising the scoring model are: previous history of VTE (3 points), known 
thrombophilia (3 points), age>60 years (1 point), and cancer (1 point). The Khorana score was 
developed for cancer outpatients receiving chemotherapy . Abnormal pre -chemotherapy complete 
blood count indices (white blood cell > 11x109/L, hemoglobin < 10 g/dL, and/or platelet count > 
350x109/L) are independently associated with thrombosis in cancer outpatients and are elements 
of the Khorana risk score. [16-18] In order to evaluate the performance of the Khorana score in 
predicting thrombotic risk for hospitalized cancer patients, we will calculate the Khorana score 
utilizing laboratory data (e.g. blood counts) upon admission.  The Khorana score will be 
calculated for all patients following completion of the study during the data analysis phase. As 
this scoring system was not specifically developed for cancer patients, we will explore whether 
improved specificity can b e achieved while retaining sensitivity to identify patients at greatest 
risk for VTE.  
 
Microparticles and risk of thrombosis in cancer patients.  
Microparticles are vesicular structures measuring less than 1 m in size and are derived from a 
number of cells within the vascular compartment including leukocytes, platelets, red blood cells, 
and endothelial cells. [19] Initial interest in exploring the association between tissue factor 
bearing microparticles and thrombosis was based on observations that tissue factor bearing 
microparticles bind to a developing thrombus and play a role in fibrin  propagation in vivo. [20] 
Utilizing an impedance -based flow cytometer specifically modified for microparticle  
measurement, we observed that tissue factor bearing microparticles are elevated in cancer 
patients diagnosed with VTE (adjusted OR 3.72, P=0.01) and appear to be derived from the 
underlying tumor. [21] The association between tissue factor bearing microparticles and cancer 
associated thrombosis has now been reported by several groups, including in a mouse model of 
vascular injury. [22-25] A randomized, multi -center phase II clinical trial (MicroTEC Trial ) 
substantiated the prognostic role of tissue factor bearing microparticles and VTE in cancer 
patients. [26] The cumulative incidence of VTE in cancer patients with elevated tissue factor 
bearing microparticles randomized to observation was 27% compared with 5%  in those 
receiving enoxaparin (Gray’s test P=0.06) while 7 .2% of those cancer patients with low levels of 
tissue factor bearing microparticles were diagnosed with VTE without thromboprophylaxis. 
Notably, the cumulative incidence of VTE was 43% at 2 month in patients with both elevated 
levels of D -dimer and tissue  factor bearing microparticles compared with 4.2% for all other 
study subjects (Gray’s test P value = 0.0001). [26] Planned correlative studies include the 
measurement of tissue factor bearing microparticles as well as the population of tissue factor 
bearing microparticles co -expressing P -selec tin glycoprotein 1(PSGL -1).

5. TREATMENT PLAN  
 
5.1 Treatment Regimen  
 
Treatment Overview : 
 
Eligible participant s will be randomized to standard dose enoxaparin at 40 mg once daily (Arm 
A) versus weight -based enoxaparin at 1 mg/kg once daily (Arm B). On study enoxaparin  will be 
administered for up 14 days  during hospitalization . Physicians and participant s will be double -
blinded to e noxaparin dosing during hospitalization (or up to 14 days) . After  the day 14 
assessment, treatment arms will be un -blinded in order to appropriately schedule a bilateral lower 
extremi ty ultrasound for participant s enrolled onto  Arm A at day 17 .  
 
Note that patients who are discharged and re -admitted prior to day 14 will resume study 
procedures and enoxaparin administration per initial randomization.  
 
 
 
Arm A:  
DF/HCC Protocol #:  15-547 
Protocol Version Date:  08.28.18 
13 Participant s will receive enoxaparin 40 mg subcutaneously once daily.  
 
Arm B:  
Participant s will receive enoxaparin at 1mg/kg subcutaneously once daily with maximum dose of 
100 mg daily . Participant s who weigh more than 100kg will be capped at 100mg.  
 
Participants who receive at least one dose of treatment post -randomization w ill be considered 
evaluable for the study.  
 
5.2 Pre-Treatment Criteria  
 
In order to proceed with day 1 administration of enoxaparin, platelet count must be > 50,000/l 
and CrCl must be > /= 50 ml/min. All other laboratory assessments performed within 48 hours o f 
enrollment may be used to determine eligibility and do not need to be repeated.  
 
5.2.1 Cycle 1, Day 1  
Enoxaparin syringe will be dispensed by research pharmacy. Baseline assessments for symptoms 
of VTE or hemorrhage will be recorded. All doses of enoxaparin w ill be recorded along with 
time of administration.  
 
5.2.2 Day 7 + 1 days 
Enoxaparin will be ordered on a daily basis and study labs will be continued for those study 
subjects who remain hospitalized. Assessment for evidence of major hemorrhage or VTE will be 
recorded by study staff  if the participant  remains hospitalized . 
 
5.2.3 Day 14  -4, + 7 days 
Enoxaparin should be continued until either hospital discharge or day 14. After receiving the 
final dose of enoxaparin no additional doses of enoxaparin on study will be adm inistered.  
Assessment for evidence of major hemorrhage or VTE will be recorded. After  the day 14 clinical 
assessment, s tudy staff will become unblinded to treatment allocation in order to appropriately 
schedule a bilateral lower extremity ultrasound for s tudy subjects on Arm A  (see 5.3 below) . For 
participant s who remain hospitalized, study subjects should continue with standard 
pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis  per the discretion of the treating physician.  Day 14 symptom 
assessment can be performed by phon e. 
 
   
5.3 Off treatment procedures (unblinding)  
 
Following the completion of the day 14 assessment, study staff will contact a clinical research 
pharmacist at BIDMC. Criteria for off treatment will be reviewed and then the study staff will be 
informed as to w hether the participant  was previously assigned to Arm A (standard enoxaparin) 
versus Arm B (weight -based enoxaparin). For participant s randomized to Arm A, a bilateral 
ultrasound will be scheduled (see study calendar) to evaluate for asymptomatic deep vein  
thrombosis.

7. ADVERSE EVENTS:  LIS T AND REPORTING REQU IREMENTS  
 
Adverse event (AE) monitoring and reporting is a routine part of every clinical trial.  The 
following list of reported and/or poten tial AEs (Section 7.1) and the characteristics of an 
observed AE (Section 7.2) will determine whether the event requires expedited  reporting  in 
addition  to routine  reporting.  
 
 
7.1  Definitions  
 
Adverse Event (AE)  
 
An adverse event (AE) is any undesirable sign , symptom or medical condition 
or experience that develops or worsens in severity after starting the first dose of 
study treatment or any procedure specified in the protocol, even if the event is 
not considered to be related to the study. All related adver se events will be 
followed until resolution.  
 
Abnormal laboratory values or diagnostic test results constitute adverse events 
only if they induce clinical signs or symptoms or require treatment or further 
diagnostic tests.  
Serious adverse event (SAE)  
 
A serious adverse event (SAE) is any adverse event, occurring at any dose and 
regardless of causality that:  
 Results in death  
 Is life -threatening. Life -threatening means that the person was at 
immediate risk of death from the reaction as it occurred, i.e., it  does not 
include a reaction which hypothetically might have caused death had it 
occurred in a more severe form.  
 Prolongs inpatient hospitalization (i.e prolonged a hospitalization beyond 
the expected length of stay).  
 Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity. Disability is 
defined as a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal 
life functions.  
 Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect; or  
 Is an important medical event when, based upon appropriate medical 
judgment, it may  jeopardize the participant and require medical  or surgical 
DF/HCC Protocol #:  15-547 
Protocol Version Date:  08.28.18 
18 intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. Examples of 
such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive 
treatment in an emergency room or at home; blood dyscras ias or 
convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization, or the 
development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
 
Events not considered to be serious adverse events are hospitalizations for:  
routine treatment or monitoring of the studied indication , not associated with any 
deterioration in condition, or for elective procedures elective or pre -planned 
treatment for a pre -existing condition that did not worsen. Emergency outpatient 
treatment for an event not fulfilling the serious criteria outlined ab ove and not 
resulting in inpatient admission respite care.  
 
Expectedness  
 
Adverse events can be 'Expected' or 'Unexpected.'  
Expected adverse event  
 
Expected adverse events are those that have been previously identified as 
resulting from administration of the agent. For the purposes of this study, an 
adverse event is considered expected  when it appears in the current adverse event 
list or is included in the informed consent document as a potential risk.    
 
Refer to Section 6.1 for a listing of expected adve rse events associated with the 
study agent(s).  
Unexpected adverse event  
  
For the purposes of this study, an adverse event is considered unexpected  when it 
varies in nature, intensity or frequency from information provided in the current 
adverse event list  or when it is not included in the informed consent document as 
a potential risk.  
   
7.2 Expected Toxicities  
 
7.2.1 Adve rse Events List for enoxaparin  
 
Enoxaparin can be associated with an increased risk of hemorrhage including life 
threatening retroperitoneal, gast rointestinal, or intracranial hemorrhages. Cases of 
epidural or spinal hematomas have been reported with the associated use of 
enoxaparin and spinal/epidural anesthesia or spinal puncture resulting in long -term or 
permanent paralysis. The risk of these eve nts is higher with the use of post -operative 
indwelling epidural catheters or by the concomitant use of additional drugs affecting 
hemostasis such as NSAIDs. The rate of major bleeding episodes following 
enoxaparin (40mg daily) in medical patients with sev erely restricted mobility during 
DF/HCC Protocol #:  15-547 
Protocol Version Date:  08.28.18 
19 acute illness was <1%.  
 
Thrombocytopenia can occur with the administration of enoxaparin. Moderate 
thrombocytopenia (platelet counts between 100,000/mm3 and 50,000/mm3) occurred 
at a rate of 1.3% in patients given enoxapar in, 1.2% in patients given heparin, and 
0.7% in patients given placebo in clinical trials. Platelet counts less than 50,000/mm3 
occurred at a rate of 0.1% in patients given enoxaparin, in 0.2% of patients given 
heparin, and 0.4% of patients given placebo i n the same trials. Thrombocytopenia of 
any degree should be monitored closely. Cases of heparin -induced thrombocytopenia 
with thrombosis have also been observed in clinical practice. Some of these cases 
were complicated by organ infarction, limb ischemia, or death.  
 
Asymptomatic increases in aspartate (AST [SGOT]) and alanine (ALT [SGPT]) 
aminotransferase levels greater than three times the upper limit of normal of the 
laboratory reference range have been reported in up to 6.1% and 5.9% of patients, 
respect ively, during treatment with enoxaparin. Similar significant increases in 
aminotransferase levels have also been observed in patients and healthy volunteers 
treated with heparin and other low molecular weight heparins. Such elevations are 
fully reversible and are rarely associated with increases in bilirubin.  
 
Mild local irritation, pain, hematoma, ecchymosis, and erythema may follow 
subcutaneous  injection of enoxaparin.  
 
 
7.3 Adverse Event Characteristics  
 
 CTCAE term (AE description) and grade:  The descriptio ns and grading scales found 
in the revised NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 
4.0 will be utilized for AE reporting.  All appropriate treatment areas should have access 
to a copy of the CTCAE version 4.0.  A copy of the CTCA E version 4.0 can be 
downloaded from the CTEP web site 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm . 
 
 For expedited reporting purposes on ly:   
- AEs for the agent (s) that are  listed above  should be reported only if the adverse event 
varies in nature, intensity or frequency from  the expected  toxicity  information which 
is provided . 
- Other AEs for the protocol  that do not require expedited report ing are outlined in the 
next section  (Expedited Adverse Event  Reporting ) under the sub -heading of Protocol -
Specific Expedited Adverse Event Reporting Exclusions.  
 
 Attribution  of the AE:  
- Definite – The AE is clearly related  to the study treatment.  
- Probable – The AE is likely related to the study treatment.  
- Possible – The AE may be related  to the study treatment.  
- Unlikely – The AE is doubtfully related to the study treatment.  
DF/HCC Protocol #:  15-547 
Protocol Version Date:  08.28.18 
20 - Unrelated – The AE is clearly NOT related  to the study treatment.  
 
7.4 Expedited Adverse  Event Reporting   
 
7.4.1 Investigators must  report to the Overall PI  any serious adverse event (SAE ) attributed to 
heparin (definite, probable or possible)  that occur s after the initial dose of study 
treatment, during treatment, or within 30 days of the last dos e of treatment on the local 
institutional SAE form.  
 
7.4.2 For multi -institution studies where a DF/HCC investiga tor is serving as the Overall 
Principal Investigator , each participating institution  must  abide by the reporting 
requirements set by the DF/HCC  as defined below . This applies to any medical event 
equivalent to an unexpected grade 2 or 3 with a possible, pr obable or definite attribution, 
unexpected grade 4 toxicities, and grade 5 (death) regardless of study phase or 
attribution.  
 
7.4.3 DF/HCC Expedited Repor ting Guidelines  
 
Investig ative sites within DF/HCC and  DF/PCC will report SAEs directly to the DFCI 
Office for Human Research Studies (OHRS) per the DFCI IRB  reporting policy .  
 
Other investigative sites  will report SAEs to their respective IRB according t o the local 
IRB’s policies and procedures in reporting adverse events. A copy of the submi tted 
institutional SAE form should  be forwarded to the Overall PI  within the timeframes 
detailed in the table below.

7.6 Expedited Reporting to Hospital Risk Management  
 
Participating investigators will report to their local Risk Management office any participant 
safety reports or sentinel events that require reporting according to institutional policy.  
 
7.7 Routine Adverse Event Reporting  
 
All Adverse Events must  be reported in routine study data submissions  to the Overall PI  on the 
toxicity case report f orms . Because of the established toxicity profile o f enoxaparin, only 
attributable AE will need to be recorded.  AEs reported through expedited processes (e.g.,  
reported to the IRB, FDA, etc.)  must also be reported in routine study data submissions.  
 
 
8. PHARMACEUTICAL  INFORMATION  
 
A list of the adverse events  and potential risks associated with enoxaparin  administered in this 
study can be found in Section 7.1.  
 
 
8.1 Enoxaparin  
 
8.1.1 Description  
 
Enoxaparin sodium is obtained by alkaline depolymerization of heparin benzyl ester 
derived from porcine intestinal mucosa. Ma ximum anti -Factor Xa and anti -thrombin 
(anti-Factor Iia) activi ties occur 3 to 5 hours after subcutaneous  injection. Mean absolute 
bioavailability of enox aparin, after 1.5 mg/kg given subcutaneously , based on anti -Factor 
Xa activity is approximately 100% i n healthy subjects. After repeated subcutaneous 
administration of 40 mg once daily, the steady state is reached on day 2 with an average 
exposure ratio about 15% higher than after a single dose. Steady -state enoxaparin activity 
levels are well predicted by  single -dose pharmacokinetics. Following subcutaneous  
dosing, the apparent clearance (CL/F) of enoxaparin is approximately 15 mL/min of 
enoxaparin. Enoxaparin is primarily metabolized in the liver by desulfation and/or 
depolymerization to lower molecular w eight species with much reduced biological 
potency. Total renal excretion of active and non -active fragments represents 40% of the 
dose.  
 
DF/HCC Protocol #:  15-547

9. BIOMARKER, CORRELATIVE , AND SPECI AL STUDIES  
 
DF/HCC Protocol #:  15-547 
Protocol Version Date:  08.28.18 
23 9.1 Biomarker Studies  
 
We previously demonstrated the predictive value of circulating tissue factor bearing 
microparticles in cancer outpatients. We will evaluate if the number of tissue factor bearing 
microparticles upon hospitalization predicts t hrombotic risk. Microparticles will be isolated from 
plasma by differential centrifugation. We modified an impedance -based flow cytometry system 
(Beckman Coulter SC Quanta) in order to address the shortcomings of standard light scatter 
based flow cytometry  in the measurement of small (<1 m) particles. [21] Using this 
methodology we observed a si gnificant correlation between elevation in tissue factor bearing 
microparticles and the development of cancer -associated thrombosis. [21, 26]   
 
Based on animal models suggesting that tumor derived tissue factor beari ng microparticles 
accumulate at the site of a developing thrombus through the binding of PSGL -1 with P -selectin, 
we will evaluate whether subpopulations of TF -bearing microparticles are associated with 
thrombosis in hospitalized cancer patients. By flow cy tometry , we will determine the percentage 
of TF -bearing microparticles co -expressing the PSGL -1, MUC1, and/or CD14 antigens.  
 
D-dimer is a degradation product of cross -linked fibrin and is the most widely utilized sensitive 
biomarker to exclude venous thr omboembolic events. [27, 28]  Utility of D -dimer alone to predict 
thrombosis in cancer patients is limited due to poor specificity especially using standard cut -
offs.[29] D-dimer will be measured by using a commercially available immunoassay (Roche 
Diagnostics).  We will analyze the association between thrombosis and elevated D -dimer values 
based on standard cutoff of >500ng/L, 75th percentile based on measurements using stored 
plasma from cancer patients [21, 29]  or age adjusted -cutoff which was recently demonstrated to 
improve assay specificity in a large cohort of patients (including 429 patients with active 
malignancy). [28] In order not to confound study outcomes, D -Dimer measurements will be 
performed centrally at BIDMC after the completion of the trial and will not be recorded in the 
participant ’s medical record.

11. MEASUREMENT OF EFFEC T 
 
Venous Thromboembolism (VTE)  
 
Cumulative incidence of venous thromboembolic events is the primary endpoint  for Arm A and a 
secondary endpoint for Arm B.  The co mposite en dpoint includes objectively confirmed 
proximal or distal l ower extremity DVT, subsegmental or larger pulmonary embolism ; or fatal 
PE diagnosed by autopsy . All other venous or arterial events will be re corded and analyzed as 
secondary endpoints  (including central line associated DVT) . 
 
Participant s presenting with symptoms compatible with DVT and/or PE will undergo 
radiographic imaging with compression ultrasound, VQ lung scan, or spiral CT. Confirmed 
episodes of VTE will be managed by the treating physician per standard of practice.  
 
Presence of any of the following will be considered diagnostic for a VTE:  
 New non -compressibility of lower extremity deep venous segments by compression

Major Hemorrhage  
Adhering to published guidelines, the criteria of major hemorrhage in non -surgical participant s 
is:[30] 
o Fatal bleeding, and/or  
o Symptomatic bleeding in a critical area or organ such as intracranial, 
intraspinal, intraocular, retroperitoneal, intra -articular or pericardial, or 
intramuscular with compartment syndrome, and/or  
o Bleeding causing a fall in hemoglobin level >2 g/L or  
o Bleeding leading to a transfusion of > 2 units of packed red blood cells.   
 
 
Response Re view  
 
VTE:  A blinded -centralized  independent adjudication of VTE qualifying for the primary 
outcome will be performed  at BIDMC . The review committee will be comprised of two 
independent radiologists who will review all lower extremity ultrasounds as well a s any other 
imaging that identifies a new thromboembolism. Any disagreements will be settled by 
consensus.

13. STATISTICAL CONSIDER ATIONS  
 
 
13.1 Study Design/Endpoints  
 
The primary aim of randomized phase II trial is to estimate the cumulative incidence of VTE and 
major hemorrhage in hospitalized cancer patients receiving standard dose or weight adjusted 
enoxaparin.  
 
13.2 Sample Size , Accrual Ra te and Study Duration  
 
The documented incidence of VTE in cancer patients in randomized clinical trials ranges 
considerably (3 -17%) on pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis at standard prophylactic dosing. [8] 
With the ad ditional incorporation of tumor -specific thrombotic risk assessment, we anticipate the 
incidence of VTE for high risk cancer patients receiving fixed standard dose  enoxaparin will be 
greater than 10%, especially with inclusion of protocol -mandated lower ex tremity ultrasounds.  
 
We plan to enroll a total of 50 high risk cancer patients between Beth Israel Deaconess Medical 
Center  and Cleveland Clinic  Foundation , of which 25 will be randomized to standard dose  
enoxaparin. Assuming a cumulative incidence of th rombosis at day 1 7 is 12% (90% binomial 
confidence interval 3.3to 28.2%),While we anticipate an increased risk of major hemorrhage 
observed in cancer patients compared to that of general medical patients, we expect these events 
to be rate. Point estimates of hemorrhage endpoints at Day 14 will be provided along with the 
90% exact binomial confidence intervals . The point estimate will serve to inform sample size 
calculations for a larger phase III clinical trial.  
 
 
The trial will only be open at BI DMC and C leveland Clinic and we anticipate enrolling 3patients 
per month.  
 
Participants who receive at least one dose of treatment post -randomization will be considered 
evaluable for the study.

13.3 Stratification Factors  
 
Randomization will be stratified for hospital ( BIDMC and  CCF)  and risk of cancer based on 
Khorana model : very high risk (stomach, pancreatic), high risk (lung, lymphoma, gynecologic, 
bladder, testicular), and standard risk (all others).  
 
13.4 Interim Monitoring Plan  
 
We plan an interim analysis for safety with the D SMB at any point the number of hemorrhages 
on Arm B is more than 2 greater than observed on Arm A .  (We note that the arms are unblinded 
on day 14, so this plan does not compromise the integrity of the study.)    If the true rate of 
hemorrhage on Arm B is 2 %, the probability of observing 2 or more such events in 25 patients is  
0.09    In this setting, we will also provide the DSMB with the rates of hemorrhage on Arm A, as 
this study will provide the best available estimate of the rate of hemorrhage with stan dard dosing 
enoxaparin.  Efficacy data will also be provided, so that the DSMB can weigh benefit against 
risk. 
There is no  plan to adjust the planned enrollment if the event rates are lower than anticipated. 
The reason being is that the primary goal is eva luate point estimates of VTE and hemorrhage  in 
order to plan for a larger trial rather than adequately power for the direct comparison between 
fixed dose enoxaparin and intermediate -dose enoxaparin in the current study . 
 
13.5 Analysis of Primary Endpoints  
 
Cumu lative incidence of  VTE at day 17 (in arm A) and major hemorrhage endpoints at day 14 
(both arms) will be calculated  along with their 90% exact binomial confidence intervals.  
 
DF/HCC Protocol #:  15-547 
Protocol Version Date:  08.28.18 
30 13.6 Analysis of Exploratory Objectives  
 
13.6.1  Efficacy analysis : Although the study is not  formally powered to determine efficacy, we 
will perform a secondary analysis to preliminarily compare the cumulative incidence of 
symptomatic VTE (data collected prior to unblinding) for the standard dose (Arm A)  
versus intermediate dose enoxaparin  (Arm B) . Accordingly, assuming a VTE event rate 
of 25% which is towards the upper end of the binomial confidence interval in the 
standard enoxaparin arm compared with a 0% event rate in the intermediate dose 
enoxaparin arm, the power of the study is 0.7 4 with a o ne-sided  of 0.05.  The 
cumulative incidence rate of VTE at day 1 7 will be estimated using the competing risk 
method, where VTE is the primary event and death is considered the competing 
event. [31] 
 
13.6.2  Prediction models: For each of the three scoring systems (Padua, Khorana, IMPROVE), 
we plan to assess the 2 by 2 contingency table distributions while changing the score cut -
offs (such as a Padua score >6 or an IMPROVE scores >5 or a Khorana score >3) in 
order to evaluate wheth er the classification probabilities (particularly specificity and 
sensitivity) change based on the chosen cut -off. The goal is to see if we can determine a 
more stringent cut -off (compared to a Padua score >4) by considering the Padua scoring 
system and/or the other 2 scoring systems to further refine hospitalized cancer patients at 
high risk of VTE. We aim at maintaining 100% sensitivity, while improving the 
specificity of the refined risk model. We fully recognize that based on the limited number 
of patien ts enrolled that we will have limited power to determine definitively whether the 
additional risk models can reliably improve specificity without impacting sensitivity. 
Therefore, we do not plan on utilizing these data to refine the inclusion/exclusion cri teria 
for the planned phase III trial, but rather will confirm the findings within the phase III 
trial through stratification at time of randomization.  
 
DF/HCC Protocol #:  15-547 
Protocol Version Date:  08.28.18 
31 13.6.3  Biomarkers : The primary analysis of each of the biomarkers is to identify whether any of 
the pre -defin ed cutoff values are sensitive for VTE in the high risk cancer patients 
randomized to fixed -dose enoxaparin. Biomarkers such as tissue factor bearing 
microparticles and D -dimer have previously demonstrated low positive predictive values 
but high negative p redictive values in cancer cohorts. [26, 28, 29]  The combination of 
high tissue factor bearing microparticles (>3.5x104 microparticles/µl, the top tercile of 
tissue factor -bearing microparticle concentrations from th e reference specimens) and 
elevated D -dimer further improved the sensitivity and specificity of the individual 
assays. [26] We will evaluate whether any of the individual biomarkers or combination of 
biomarkers are s ensitive to identify all VTE diagnosed in the high risk cancer patients 
randomized to fixed -dose enoxaparin. We plan to assess the 2 by 2 contingency table 
distributions using the pre -defined cut -off values in order to evaluate the classification 
probabili ties (particularly specificity and sensitivity) based on the chosen cut -off. The top 
tercile of tissue factor -bearing microparticle concentrations and D -dimer or the age -
adjusted D -dimer cut -off of the study cohorts will be also considered to evaluate the 
classification probabilities of the classification model. Fine and Gray univariate 
regression models will be used to assess the impact of each biomarker classification on 
the risk of developing VTE. In addition, using regression models we aim at assessing 
whether there is an association between the scores in the scoring systems and the 
biomarkers. As this is the initial exploratory evaluation of PSGL -1+ microparticles and 
thrombosis, additional validation in the phase III trial will be required.  
 
13.7 Reporting  and Exclusions  
 
13.7.1  Evaluation of T oxicity  
All participants will be evaluable for toxicity from the time of the first dose of enoxaparin.  
 
13.7.2  Evaluation of the Primary Efficacy Endpoint  
All participants will be assessed for primary endpoints as long as received  at least 1 dose of 
enoxaparin following randomization .  
 
 
14. PUBLICATION PLAN

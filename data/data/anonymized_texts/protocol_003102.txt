Amendment 2  6 October 2021  
Amendment 1  25 February 2021  
Original Protocol  16 October 2020  
Amendment 5: 
This amendment is considered substantial based on the criteria defined in Article  10(a) of 
Directive 2001/20/EC of the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union 
because of significant  changes in the conduct or management  of the study . 
Overall rationale for the current Amendment:   
The purpose of this amendment is to remove Dose 3 administration before the start of 
Season 3  for participants in the NH and to add a blood sample at Visit 5NH for all 
participants who are not in the reactogenicity and immunogenicity subset .  
The results of VE Analysis 3 evaluating efficacy and safety of RSVPreF3 OA 
investigational vaccine up to the end of Season 2 in the NH, showed that  a single dose of 
the RSVPreF3 OA investigational  vaccine was efficacious against RSV -confirmed LRTD 
and severe LRTD  over 2 RSV seasons . The VE against RSV -confirmed LRTD was 
67.18% [97.5% CI: 48.19, 80.04]. The VE against severe LRTD was 78. 83% (95% CI: 
52.59, 91.96).  
The study also evaluated efficacy following an annual revaccination schedule. Over 
2 seasons, the VE in participants who received a second dose of the vaccine before 
Season 2 was similar to the VE in participants who had receive d a single dose of vaccine 
prior to Season 1 with VE of 67.12% (97.5% CI: 48.09, 80.00) against RSV -confirmed 
LRTD. These data suggest that a revaccination administered approximately 12 months  
after the first dose does not confer additional benefit for the  overall population.  The 
optimal timing for revaccination still needs to be determined . 
Safety and reactogenicity data post -Dose 2 were consistent with previous  results from the 
Phase 3 program.  Based on available reactogenicity and safety data  up to the end of 
Season 2 in the NH (DLP 31 March 2023) , with a median follow -up time from Dose 1 up 
to DLP of approximately 18.2 months, and from Dose 2 up to DLP of approximately 
6.7 months, the RSVPreF3 OA investigational vaccine showed a clinically acceptable 
safety profile in adults ≥  60 YOA. The reactogenicity of the RSVPreF3 OA 
investigational  vaccine was similar following each dose, with most of the solicited events 
being mild to moderate and of short duration . No safety concerns were identified with 
currentl y available data.

212494 (RSV OA=ADJ -006) 
Protocol Amendment 5 Final  
12 July 2023  8 Based o n these observation s, the study design was modified to remove the next planned 
dose of the study intervention (Dose 3 pre -Season 3 ) in the NH. The clinical development 
program will continue to evaluate long -term follow -up and the optimal timing for 
revaccination .  
To evaluate further the correlation between humoral immune response and protection, an 
additional blood sample has been added at Visit 5NH for all participants  who are not in 
the reactogenicity and immunogenicity subset . 
This amendment does not impact participants enrolled in the SH as they have completed 
the 2 doses of study intervention as per study design.  
Minor editorial changes for consistency and clarity have also been made and 
typographical errors have been correcte d. 
Other updates are described in the table below :

Protocol Amendment 5 Final  
12 July 2023  9 List of main changes in the protocol and their rationale  
Section # and  title Description of change  Brief rationale  
Title page; sponsor approval page; 
investigator agreement page  
3. Objectives and endpoints  
7.1 Discontinuation of study 
intervention  
9.4.4.4 Quality of life  ‘Annual revaccination doses’ has been changed to ‘Ann ual revaccination’ and 
‘Annual revaccinations’ has been changed to ‘Annual revaccination’.  As Dose 2 pre -Season 2 administered 12 months 
post-Dose 1 did not confer additional benefit in 
prevention of RSV -confirmed LRTD, the study 
design was modified to rem ove the next planned 
dose of the study vaccine (Dose 3 pre -Season 3). 
These sections were thus updated to reflect this 
change.  
1.1 Synopsis  
2.1 Study rationale  
2.2 Background  
4.2.2 Rationale for the use of Placebo  Clinical development status of GSK’s RSVPreF3 OA investigational vaccine has 
been updated.  
Marketing authorization approval of the study vaccine has been added.  As GSK’s RSVPreF3 OA investigational vaccine is 
now approved for use, the clinical development 
status of the study vaccine was modi fied from 
‘developing’ to ‘developed’ and the market 
authorization approval details have been added.  
1.3 Schedule of activities  
(Table 1, Table 2, Table 4 and 
Table  5) For Table 1 , table title  has been revised to indicate that activities listed in this t able 
is applicable  for participants in the NH who have their Visit 5NH before the approval 
of the current Protocol Amendment 5. 
A new table has been added for the schedule of activities for participants in the NH 
who will have their Visit 5NH after the approval of the current Protocol 
Amendment  5 (Table 2).   
Intervals between study visits/contact for participants in the NH have been modified.  
Corrections have been made in the table footnotes to align with the changes made 
in the tables.  
Section has been  updated to reflect that a b lood sample will be taken at Visit 5NH 
from all participants in the NH who have their Visit 5NH after the approval of the 
current Protocol Amendment  5. 
Option for use of paper questionnaire for atrial fibrillation has been remov ed. 
Corrections in the footnotes were made to algin with the changes made in the table.  To align with the changes made to the study 
design with respect to  removal of Dose 3 (pre -
Season 3) and study procedures related to Dose 3 
administration.  
Blood samples collection  from all participants  in the 
NH at Visit 5 NH (pre -Season 3) was added  to allow 
for further assessment of correlation between 
humoral immune response and protection.  
As only electronic questionnaires will be used for 
follow -up of at rial fibrillation, the option for paper 
questionnaire was removed.  
2.3 Benefit/Risk assessment  
2.3.2 Benefit assessment  Updated to clarify the current status of VE assessment and clinical benefit provided 
to participants . Since initial protocol approval, VE data has 
become available at VE Analysis 3. This section 
was thus updated to reflect this information.

12 July 2023  10 Section # and  title Description of change  Brief rationale  
3 Objectives and endpoints  The secondary confirmatory objectives have been modified to indicate that efficacy 
would be assessed for only 1 annual rev accination before Season 2.  
The term ‘pre -Dose 3’ has been removed from the secondary and tertiary 
immunogenicity endpoints.  To align with the changes made to the study 
design with respect to  removal of Dose 3 (pre -
Season 3) and study procedures related t o Dose 3 
administration.  
3 Objectives and endpoints  Tertiary endpoint pertaining to assessment of correlate of protection has been 
modified in indicate that RSVPreF3 IgG -binding antibody concentration will also be 
assessed at pre -Season 3 for all particip ants in the NH.  To allow for further assessment of correlation 
between humoral immune response and 
protection.  
4 Study design  
4.1 Overall study design (Figure 1)  Study design has been updated to clarify that at Visit 5NH (pre -Season 3) 
participants who will have their Visit 5NH before the approval of Protocol 
Amendment 5 will receive the study intervention as planned according to their 
group allocation. Participants having their Visit 5NH after approval of the current 
Protocol Amendment 5 will not receiv e any study intervention at pre -Season 3 visit 
(Visit 5NH).  
Dose 3 at V isit 5NH (pre -Season 3), Visit 6NH and Contact 5 have been removed 
from the study design figure.  To align with the changes made to the study 
design with respect to  removal of Dose 3 (pr e-
Season 3) and study procedures related to Dose 3 
administration.  
4.1 Overall study design  
8.1.3.2 Biological samples for 
immunogenicity assessment  
8.1.5 Immunological read -outs 
8.1.7 Immunological correlates of 
protection  
9.4.5.4.1 Correlate of protect ion This section have been updated to reflect that a blood sample will be collected from 
all participants in the NH at Visit 5NH (pre -Season 3).  
Volume of blood sample to be collected from participants in the NH has been 
added.  To allow for further assessment of correlation 
between humoral immune response and 
protection.  
4.2 Scientific rationale for the study 
design  Updated to include the rationale for removing Dose 3 administration from the study 
design.  To support the changes made to the study des ign 
with respect to  removal of Dose 3 and study 
procedures related to Dose 3 administration.  
6.1 Study intervention administered  
6.3.2 Randomization to study 
intervention  
6.3.4 Allocation of participants to 
assay subsets  
6.5 Concomitant therapy  
7.1.2 Contraindications to subsequent 
vaccine administration  Updated to reflect that for participants in the NH who ha ve their Visit  5NH after the 
approval of the current Protocol Amendment 5, administration of Dose 3 at 
Visit 5NH (pre -Season 3) as well as all study procedures related to Dose 3 
administration have been cancelled.  As Dose 2 administered 12 months post -Dose  1 
did not confer additional benefit in prevention of 
RSV-confirmed LRTD, the study design was 
modified to remove the next planned dose of the 
study vaccine (Dose 3 pre -Season 3).

footnote and Visit 7NH was erro neously indicated as Visit 6NH.   To correct typographical error.  
8.3.1 Time period and frequency for 
collecting AE, SAE and other safety 
information  Safety information related to Dose 3 administration, collected at Day 1 - 4, Day 30 
and Month 6 post -Dose 3 have been removed for participants in NH who have their 
Visit 5NH after the approval of the curr ent Protocol Amendment 5 and will not 
receive any study intervention at pre -Season 3 visit (Visit 5NH).  To align with changes in the study design related to

modified to indicate that efficacy would be assessed for only 1 annual revaccination 
before Season 2.  
The term ‘pre -Dose 3’ has been removed from the secondary  and tertiary 
immunogenicity endpoints.  
A note  has been added  to clarify that participants who received Dose 3 of the study 
vaccine will not be included in the evaluation of VE of the annual revaccination over 
3 season.  
The expected total number of RSV LRTD cases and the power for each analysis 
provided in Table 28 have been updated.  
The expected number of RSV -confirmed LRTD cases for the evaluation of VE of 
the annual revaccination for Season A3NH provided in Table 30 h ave been 
updated.  This section has been updated to align with the 
changes made in the secondary confirmatory 
objectives.

Protocol Amendment 5 Final  
12 July 2023  22 1. PROTOCOL SUMMARY  
1.1. Synopsis  (Amended, 12 July 2023 ) 
Rationale:  
GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals SA (GSK)  has developed  a new  RSV PreFusion protein 
F3 Older Adult ( RSVPreF3 OA ) vaccine against RSV -associated (subtypes A and B) 
disease in adults ≥ 60 years of age ( YOA ).  
The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the efficacy of the RSVPreF3  OA 
investigational vaccine in the prevention of reverse -transcriptase polymerase chain 
reaction (RT -PCR) -confirmed lower respiratory tract disease (LRTD) caused by RSV A 
and/or B in adults ≥ 60 YOA, following a single dose of the RSVPreF3 OA vaccine and 
following annual revaccination doses. The vaccine cross -protection against RT -PCR -
confirm ed LRTD caused by human metapneumovirus (hMPV) will also be evaluated . In 
addition, the safety and immunogenicity of the vaccine will be assessed  after each dose . 
Surveillance for acute respiratory illness  (ARI) will be carried out during the entire study 
via spontaneous reporting by the study participant (starting on the first vaccination day 
[Visit 1 ]) and via scheduled site staff contacts  (as of Visit 2 onwards) . 
Based on the first results obtained in the Phase 1/2 dose formulation selection study for 
the RSVPreF3 OA investigational vaccine (RSV  OA=ADJ -002), RSVPreF3  recombinant 
antigen 120 µg adjuvanted with AS01 E as a single dose was selected for further 
evaluati on in the Phase 3 program.  
Objectives and endpoints:  
Refer to Table 8 in Section 3 for an overview of the study objectives and endpoints . 
1.2. Schema  
Refer to Figure  1 for an overview of the study design.  
1.3. Schedule of activities  (Amended, 12 July 2023 ) 
For participants who will have the Visit 5NH ( pre-Season 3 visit) taking place 
BEFORE the approval  of this Protocol Amendment 5 , the study procedures should be 
performed according to the previously approved protocol amendment version . Refer to 
Table 1 for details .  
For participants who will have the Visit 5NH ( pre-Season 3 visit) taking place AFTER 
the approval  of this Protocol Amendment 5 , the study procedures should be performed 
according to the current Protocol Amendment 5 : Dose 3 administration should be 
cancelled as  well as other procedures related to Dose 3 administration. Visit 6NH and 
Contact 5 should be cancelled  for these participants . Blood sample should be collected 
for all participants at Visit 5NH . Refer to Table 2 for details .  
Timeframe  for Visit 5NH are defined in Table  5.

Protocol Amendment 5 Final  
12 July 2023  26 1. Study visits should preferably be done on site or in the LTCF. If deemed necessary, study visits can be done at home. For the  study contacts, multiple formats can be proposed by 
the study site. These conta cts may be done via e -mail, text message, fax or phone call for example, or via a visit for LTCF participants. The most appropriate format should b e 
agreed between site staff and the study participant. Text messages, e -mail and fax may be used as a screeni ng to check if the participant has anything to report. If the participant 
answers yes for at least one of the items of interest, a phone call must be done to get the details on the event(s). Receipt of the message must be confirmed by the participant or 
caregiver, as applicable.  
2. Contacts 1, 3 and 5 must not be performed before the 6 -month post -vaccination time point to allow collection of safety data up to at least 6  months after each vaccination for each 
participant. These contacts can be combined with ano ther contact or visit.  
3. Freely given and written informed consent must be obtained from each study participant prior to participation in the study . The participant’s informed consent may be obtained prior 
to Visit 1 . In addition, participants should sign th e ICF addendum for revaccination (Protocol Amendment 3) at Visit 3.  
4. In case the participant does not agree to continue the study for the annual revaccination, the study conclusion page of the e CRF should be completed.  
5. Any vaccination administered up to 1 y ear before administration of the first  study vaccine dose should be recorded in the eCRF. Administration of Shingrix  at any timepoint (even if 
longer than 1 year before the first study vaccination) should be recorded in the eCRF.  
6. If deemed necessary by the  investigator.  
7. The blood samples at Visits 1, 3 and 5NH  should be taken prior to vaccine administration.  
8. These blood samples should only be taken from participants in the reactogenicity and immunogenicity subset.  
9. A paper diary will be distributed to all st udy participants on each vaccination day (at Visits 1, 3 and 5NH). All participants will record unsolicited AEs and concomita nt 
medications/products on the day of each vaccination and for 29  subsequent days (Days 1 -30). In addition, participants in the rea ctogenicity subset will be asked to record solicited 
events on the day of each vaccination and for 3  subsequent days (Days 1 -4). 
10. SAEs related to study participation, or to a concurrent GSK medication/vaccine should be collected from the time of consent o btained (prior to administration of the first  study 
vaccine dose) up to study end.  
11. Atrial fibrillation (AF) will be considered as adverse events of special interest (AESI) in this study and will be additional ly reported in the AF follow -up questionnaire (ele ctronic) in 
eCRF. The collection of AF will be performed following the AE/SAE reporting periods. For AF that were reported before the imp lementation of the Protocol Amendment 4, additional 
available information should be encoded in the specific AF follow -up questionnaire retrospectively .

2. INTRODUCTION  
2.1. Study r ationale  (Amended , 12 July 2023 ) 
GSK  has developed a new RSVPreF3 OA  vaccine against RSV -associated (subtypes A 
and B) disease in adults ≥ 60 YOA . 
The purpose of the current study is to demonstrate the efficacy of the RSVPreF3 OA 
investigational vaccine in the prevention of RT -PCR -confirmed LRTD caused by RSV A 
and/or B in adults ≥ 60 YOA, following a single dose of the RSVPreF3 OA vaccine and 
follow ing annual revaccination. The vaccine cross -protection against RT -PCR -confirmed 
LRTD caused by human metapneumovirus (hMPV) will also be evaluated . In addition, 
the safety and immunogenicity of the vaccine will be assessed  after each dose . 
The rationale for the study design is presented in Section 4.2. 
2.2. Background  (Amended , 12 July 2023)  
RSV is a ribonucleic acid (RNA) virus of which 2  antigenically distinct sub types  exist, 
referred to as RSV A and RSV B [ Borchers , 2013]. RSV is a highly contagious human 
pathogen that cause s respiratory tract infections  in people of all ages. In temperate 
climates throughout the world, RSV predictably causes fall -winter  epidemics . In (sub) 
tropical regions, viral activity is more endemic , and outbreaks are less temporally 
focused.  
CONFIDENTIAL  
212494 (RSV OA=ADJ -006) 
Protocol Amendment 5 Final  
12 July 2023  39 As the global population ages, the morbidity and mortality of respiratory infections 
appear to be steadily increasing  in the older adult  popul ation [ Lee, 2013; Binder , 2017] . 
Based on epidemiological data collected prospectively in 2008 -2010 in 14 countries 
worldwide (including North America, Europe and East Asia), the average percentage of 
documented RSV infection s in older adults ( ≥ 65 years) with influenza -like illness is 
7.4%, with values between 0% and  17.1% across countries [ Falsey , 2014].  In 2015, an 
estimated 1.5  million episodes of RSV -related acute respiratory illness occurred in older 
adults in industrialized countries; approximately 14.5% of these episodes involved a 
hospital admission [ Nam , 2019]. Further information on RSV incidence and disease 
burden  can be found in the Investigator’s Brochure (IB).  
Previous infection with RSV does not prevent subsequent infections. Therefore, re -
infection with RSV occurs throughout an individual’s lifetime and is common in all age 
groups [ Simoes , 1999; Krilov , 2011]. Generally, these re -infections go undiagnosed 
becau se they usually manifest as common acute upper respiratory tract infections . 
However, in more vulnerable individuals (e.g. , immunocompromised  person s or older 
adults), re -infections can also lead to severe disease [ Graham , 2011].  
hMPV is a n RNA pneumovirus related to RSV, sharing similar genomic/structural 
organizations and associated clinical manifestations [ ICTV , 2019]. Similar to RSV, 
hMPV is a highly contagious human pathogen causing upper and lower respiratory tract 
infections in people of all ages. In older adults , clinical manifestations can be 
asym ptomatic or ranging from mild upper respiratory tract infections to severe 
pneumonia [ Walsh , 2008]. Older adults aged 65 years or above are at increased ris k of 
severe hMPV disease and hospitalization [ Falsey , 2003; Walsh , 2008; Widmer , 2012].  
Rates of intensive care unit admissions, mechanical ventilation, length of hospital or 
intensive care unit stay were simi lar for hMPV, RSV and influenza infected adults [Haas , 
2013; Walsh , 2008; Widmer , 2012 ]. 
At the time of initiation of this study, no vaccine nor other prophylac tic treatment was 
available against RSV or hMPV in older adults. Since then, GSK’s RSVPreF3 OA 
investigational vaccine was first approved for use in an adults ≥ 60 YOA in the US on 3 
May 2023, followed by the European Union on 6 June 2023.  
The RSVPreF3 OA investigational vaccine was administered for the first time to adults 
60–80 YOA according to a 0, 2 -month intramuscular vaccination schedule in another 
clinical study (RSV OA=ADJ -002). The vaccine formulation and schedule used in the 
present study , i.e., RSVPreF3 recombinant antigen,  120 µg adjuvanted with AS01 E as a 
single dose,  was selected based on safety and immunogenicity data from the 
RSV  OA=ADJ -002 study.  In addition, the Phase 1 study RSV OA=ADJ -003 has been  
conducted in Japan to evaluate the safety , reactogenicity and immunogenicity of the 
RSVPreF3 OA investigational vaccine (RSVPreF3 recombinant antigen, 120 µg 
adjuvanted with AS01 B) in 40 healthy ethnic Japanese adults 60 -80 YOA . No safety 
concerns were identified so far.  
Please refer to the current IB for information regarding pre -clinical and clinical studies  of 
the RSVPreF3 OA investigational vaccine .

Protocol Amendment 5 Final  
12 July 2023  40 2.3. Benefit/Risk a ssessment  
In this study, up to  12 500 participants will be exposed to at least one dose of the 
RSVPreF3  OA investigational vacc ine, whereas up to 12  500 participants will receive a 
placebo  (refer to Section 9.2 for more details on the number of participants to be 
enrolled) . 
2.3.1.  Risk assessment  
Information about the reasonably expected adverse events (AEs) and the known and 
expected benefits and potential  risks (potential syncope, hypersensitivity) of the 
RSVPreF3 OA investigational vaccine or the adjuvant system (potential immune -
mediated diseases [pIMDs]) can be found in the IB and the Development Safety Update 
Report (DSUR).  
Intramuscular vaccination co mmonly precipitates a transient and self -limiting local 
inflammatory reaction. This may typically include pain at injection site, erythema and 
swelling.  
In addition to potential risks related to the vaccine, there may be risks related to the blood 
sampling  planned in the study:  
• Pain and bruising may occur at the site where blood is drawn; as a mitigation 
strategy, a topical analgesic may be applied to the site where blood will be taken.  
• Syncope (fainting) can occur following or even before any blood draw as  a 
psychogenic response to the needle insertion.  
For details of study procedures, dose and study design justification, refer to Section s 1.3 
and 4, respectively . 
2.3.2.  Benefit assessment  (Amended, 12 July 2023)  
At the start of this study, the efficacy of the RSVPreF3 OA investigational vaccine was 
not demonstrated yet. Hence it was unknown if t he participants receiving the RSVPreF3 
OA investigational vaccine would  benefit from this vaccination . Since then,  the efficacy 
of RSVPreF3 OA investigational vaccine was demonstrated and the study primary 
confirmatory objective was met. One dose of RSVPreF3 OA investigational vaccine has 
shown a favorable benefit/risk profile . The vaccine was approved for use in an a dults 
≥ 60 YOA in the US on 3 May 2023, followed by the European Union on 6 June 2023.   
The VE Analysis 3 data showed that revaccination administered approximately 12 
months after Dose 1 did not confer additional benefit in prevention of RSV -confirmed 
LRTD  for the overall population of adults ≥ 60 YOA, while the second dose of vaccine 
has a clinically acceptable safety profile. The clinical development program will 
continue to evaluate longer term follow -up and the optimal timing for potential 
revaccination . 
CONFIDENTIAL  
212494 (RSV OA=ADJ -006) 
Protocol Amendment 5 Final  
12 July 2023  41 Another benefit for all study participants may include gaining of information about their 
general health status through the medical evaluations/assessments associated with this 
study (i.e., physical examination).  
2.3.3.  Overall Benefit /Risk conclusion  
The RSVPr eF3 OA investigational vaccine is in clinical development. Considering  the 
measures  taken  to minimize the risk to participants in this study, the potential risks are 
justified by the potential benefits linked to the development of this vaccine.

pre-Season 3 visit (Visit 5NH ). These participants had received 1 additional 
dose before Season  2.  
− Participants from the SH will receive 1 additional dose before Season 2.  
• Safety monitoring:  An IDMC , in addition to the existing GSK’s Safety Review 
Team (SRT) , will oversee the safety of the study participants and study conduct  
(refer to Section 8.2.3 ). 
• ARI s urveillance : Surveillance for ARI detection  will be carried out during the 
entire study, via spontaneous reporting by the study participant (starting on the  first 
vaccination  day* [Visit 1]) and via scheduled site staff contact s (starting from Visit 2 
onwards)  with different frequencies of contact during the RSV seasons and the inter -
season periods  (refer to Section 8.1.1 ). Swab samples will be taken in all participant s 
meeting pre -specified criteria for ARI case definition  (refer to Section  4.2.1 ). 
Diagnosis and treatment of each ARI should be performed according to the local 
standard of care.  
* For detailed information on activities involved in ARI surveillance, refer to Table

4.1.1.  Overview of the recruitment plan  
The aim is to enroll between at least  16 000 and up to 23  000 participants in the NH and 
between 1  500 to 2  000 participants in the SH with a rando mization  ratio of 1:1:1:3 for 
Part 1 of the study ( RSVPreF3 Lot 1/2/3 v ersus Placebo) and a rando mization  ratio of 1:1 
for Part 2 ( RSVPreF3 Lot 4 v ersus Placebo) before Season 1 . Refer to Section 9.2.1  for 
details on the sample size calculation.  
The recruitment plan may be adapted based on the actual number of participants enrolled 
in each hemisphere or within each sex. In case a hemisphere or country would fall behind 
in participant recruitment (in a specific age group or overall), a redistribution of the 
enrol lment target per hemisphere/country may be made to allow the other participating 
country(ies) to enroll additional participants in an effort to ensure full and timely 
enrol lment of the overall ta rgeted number of participants specified in this protocol.  
The procedures for participants identification/recruitment ha ve to be approved by the

Protocol Amendment 5 Final  
12 July 2023  52 4.1.2.  Enrol lment  rules  
Overall, participants will be enrolled in 3 age categories reflecting  an approximate age 
distribution  in the general population with a balance between males and females . It is 
therefore intended to enroll:  
• Approximately  40% of participants 60-69 YOA, approximately 30% of participants 
70-79 YOA and approximately 10% of participants  ≥ 80 YOA. The remaining 20% 
can be distributed freely a cross the 3 age categories . 
• Approximately 40% of participants from each sex; the remaining 20% can be 
distributed freely  between the 2 sexes . 
Participants from both community dwelling (CD) and long -term care facilities (LTCFs ) 
may be enrolled.  
Allocation of participants to the reactogenicity and immunogenicity subset:  
Participants contributing to the reactogenicity and immunogenicity subset will be 
recruited from a selected number of countries and selected number of sites  in Part 1. In 
the selected sites, the investigator will allocate the first participants in each age categor y 
to the reactogenicity and immunogenicity subset until the allocated target is reached.  
4.2. Scientific rationale for study design  (Amended, 12 July 
2023)  
The study is designed as a Phase 3, observer -blind, placebo -controlled study enrolling 
adults  ≥ 60 YOA, who will be followed  up for 3 consecutive RSV seasons in the NH and 
at least 2 consecutive  RSV seasons in the SH. The study population will be represent ative 
of the global population beyond 60 YOA . Older adults living in the community (CD 
participants ) and LTCFs residents (LTCF participant s) with medically stable conditions  
may be enrolled . Please refer to Section 10.5.2  (Glossary of terms ) for the definition of 
CD participants and LTCF.  
There is uncertainty about the persistence of the immune response to the RSVPreF3 OA 
investigational vaccine administered as a single dose and the level of immune response 
that may be required for protection. In addition, older adults may require repeated dosing 
to maintain protection against the RSV disease over several se asons. This study has been 
designed to consider the possibility of a decline in the immune response and level of 
protection through the assessment of annual revaccination  doses administered before the 
start of each season.  
For that reason, the study will not only evaluate the efficacy, immunogenicity, safety and 
reactogenicity profile following a single dose vaccination regimen of the RSVPreF3 OA 
investigational vaccine in adults ≥60 YOA, but will also evaluate the efficacy, safety and 
reactogenicity of add itional vaccine dose s through annual revaccination . The RSV_1dose 
group will  allow the evaluation of multi -year protection of a single dose of the RSVPreF3 
OA vaccine  and the RSV_annual group will allow the evaluation of VE of annual 
revaccination  doses of the RSVPreF3 OA vaccine.

Protocol Amendment 5 Final  
12 July 2023  53 The results of VE Analysis 3 evaluating the efficacy and safety up to the end of 
Season  2 in the NH , showed that 1 dose of the RSVPreF3 OA vaccine is efficacious 
against RSV -LRTD and severe LRTD at least over 2 RSV seasons, and  that a second 
dose of the study vaccine administered before Season 2 did not confer additional 
benefit in prevention of RSV -confirmed LRTD. Safety and reactogenicity data post -
Dose 2 were consistent with previous results from the Phase 3 program.  
Based on  this observation , the study design was modified to remove the next annual 
revaccination dose of study vaccine (Dose 3 pre -Season 3) in the NH. The clinical 
development program will continue to evaluate long term follow -up and the optimal 
timing for revacc ination.  
4.2.1.  Case definitions for evaluation of vaccine efficacy  
All participants reporting at least 2 ARI symptoms /signs  meeting the ARI case definition 
(see Table 10) will be followed  up for ARI assessment. Diagnosis and treatment of each 
ARI should be performed according to the local standard of care. RT-PCR testing for 
RSV/hMPV will be performed at GSK clinical laboratory or designated laboratory . 
Therefore, all participants with ARI will be requested to follow all study procedures and 
study contacts defined for the ARI surveillance (i.e., reporting of ARI symptoms /signs , 
ARI visit and follow -up contacts , completion of QoL questionnaires, etc.).

Protocol Amendment 5 Final  
12 July 2023  55 4.2.2.  Rationale for the use of placebo  (Amended , 12 July 2023)  
As there was no licensed RSV vaccine available  at the time of initiation of this study , a 
placebo group (receiving saline solution) is used as control for the efficacy, 
safety /reactogenicity  and immunogenicity assessments.  
4.2.3.  Rationale for s tudy blinding  
Given the difference in reconstitution and visual appearance of the RSVPreF3 OA 
investigational vaccine  and the saline solution used as placebo , double blinding is not 
possible , and the study wi ll be conducted in an observer -blind manner.  Please refer to 
Section 10.5.2  (Glossary of Terms) for the definition of observer -blind.  
Further i nformation on blinding and unblinding is provided in Section 6.3.5 . 
4.3. Justification for dose   
Based on the results  up to 1 -month post -Dose 2 from study  RSV  OA=ADJ -002, a single 
dose regimen (0.5 mL) and the 120 µg RSVPreF3/AS01 E formulation were selected for 
further evaluat ion in the Phase 3 clinical program . The RSV OA=ADJ -002 study was 
designed to assess the immunogenicity of a 2 -dose AS01 -adjuvanted o r unadjuvanted 
vaccine administered according to a 0 -, 2-month schedule with the aim to maximize the 
immune response against RSV and vaccine efficacy over several seasons. Based on the 
data from clinical development programs for AS01 -adjuvanted protein ant igen vaccines 
in OA, such as Shingrix  and the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) 
investigational vaccine, it was expected that immunological responses would reach 
higher levels 1 -month post -Dose 2 as compared with 1 -month post -Dose 1. However, th e 
RSV  OA=AD J-002 results demonstrated that the second dose given 2 months after the 
first dose had no added value in terms of humoral and/or cellular  immune responses. The 
humoral response, both in terms of RSV  A neutralizing geometric mean titers (GMTs ) 
and RSVPreF3 -binding IgG geometric mean concentrations ( GMCs ), peaked 1 month 
after the first dose, and the second dose d id not increase the level observed after first 
dose.  For the rationale of the annual revaccination s, please refer to Section 4.2. 
The results from study  RSV  OA=AD J-002 demonstrated statistically significant 
superiority of the 120 µg formulations in terms of RSV  A neutralizing titers over at least 
one of the 30 µg and 60 µg formulation s with the same adjuvant content or unadjuvanted. 
An increase in the RSVPreF3 -binding  IgG GMCs and fold increase over baseline was 
also observed with increase in antigen dose from 30  µg to 120 µg.  The data demonstrated 
an immunologic benefit of any AS01 E or AS01 B formulations over unadjuvanted 
formulations in terms of frequency of RSVPreF3 -specific CD4+ T  cells expressing at 
least 2 markers. Importantly, despite lower baseline observe d in OA, the AS01 -
containing formulations induced CD4+ T cells frequencies at a close or similar level as in 
Young Adults, that is not observed with the unadjuvanted formulations.  
There was no safety concern detected in unadjuvanted groups to be linked to the 
RSVPreF3 antigen assessed for the first time in OA. T he acceptable safety/reactogenicity 
profile in all 120 µg groups, together with the immunological benefit demonstrated for 
the 120 µg antigen dose, supports the selection of a 120 µg based formulatio n. The 
CONFIDENTIAL  
212494 (RSV OA=ADJ -006) 
Protocol Amendment 5 Final  
12 July 2023  56 results also showed that al l the AS01 -adjuvanted formulations evaluated are considered 
to have a clinically acceptable safety profile . The AS01 -adjuvanted formulation with the 
lowest reactogenicity profile, i.e., the AS01 E-based formulation, was selected . The 
immunological response observed after 1 vaccine dose of the AS01 E-based formulation is 
considered adequate for a RSVPreF3 OA candidate vaccine.  
4.4. End of Study definition  
A participant is considered to have completed the study if he/she returns for the last visit 
or is available for the last scheduled procedure/contact  as described in the protocol.  
End of Study (EoS): Release of the l ast testing results of samples collected at the last ARI 
visit. In these cases, EoS must be achieved no later than  8 months after Last Participant 
Last Visit (Visit 7NH/Visit 5SH) . 
5. STUDY P OPULATION  
5.1. Inclusion c riteria  for enrol lment  
Adherence to these criteria as specified in the protocol is essential. Inclusion criteria 
deviations are not allowed because they can jeopardi ze the scientific integrity or 
regulatory acceptability of the study or participant safety.  
All participants must satisfy ALL of the following criteria at study entry:  
• Male or female  participants  ≥ 60 YOA at the time of first vaccination, who live in 
the community (CD participants) or in a LTCF ( LTCF participants ). 
Please refer to Section 10.5.2  (Glossary of Terms) f or the definition of  CD 
participants and  LTCF.  
• Participants who, in the opinion of the investigator, can and will comply with the 
requirements of the protocol (e.g. completion of the diary cards and questionnaires, 
attend regular phone calls/study site visits, perform self -swabbing , ability to access 
and utilize a phone or other electronic communications ). 
Note: In case of physical incapacity that would preclude the self -completion of the 
diary cards and/or questionnaires, either site staff can assist th e participant (for 
activities performed during site visits) or the participant may assign a caregiver to 
assist him/her with this activity  (for activities performed at home or in the LTCF ). 
However, at no time, the site staff or caregiver will evaluate the  participant’s health 
status while answering diaries and/or questionnaires or make decisions on behalf of 
the participant. Refer to Section 10.5.2  for the definition of caregiver.  
• Written or witnessed informed consent obtained from the participant prior to 
performance of any study specific procedure.  
• Participants who are medically stable in the opinion of the investigator at the time of 
first vaccination. Participants with chronic stable medical conditions with or without 
specific treatment, such as diabetes, hypertension or cardiac disease, are allowed to 
participate in this study if considered by the investigator as medically stable .

12 July 2023  58 study vaccine administration, with the exception of inactivate d and subunit influenza 
vaccines which can be administered up to 14 days before or from 14 days after each 
study vaccination.  
Note: In case an emergency mass vaccination for an unforeseen public health threat 
(e.g.: a pandemic) is recommended and/or organi zed by the public health 
authorities, outside the routine immunization program, the time period described 
above can be reduced if necessary for that vaccine provided it is used according to 
the local governmental recommendations and that the Sponsor is not ified 
accordingly.  
• Previous vaccination with a n RSV vaccine.  
• Administration of long -acting immune -modifying drugs or planned administration at 
any time during the study period (e.g. , infliximab ). 
• Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products or plasma derivatives 
during the period starting 90 days before the first study vaccine administration or 
planned administration during the study period.  
• Chronic administration (defined as more than 14 consecutive days in total) of 
immunosuppressants or ot her immune -modifying drugs during the period starting 
90 days prior to the first study vaccine administration  or planned administration 
during the study period. For corticosteroids, this will mean prednisone ≥ 20 mg/day, 
or equivalent. Inhaled and topical steroids are allowed.  
5.2.3.  Prior/Concurrent clinical study e xperience  
• Concurrently participating in another clinical study, at any time during the study

30 September in SH.  
5.3. Caregiver support  
Study participants may decide to assign a caregiv er to help them fulfilling the study 
procedures. Please refer to Section 10.5.2  for the definition of a caregiver.  
A caregiver can be appointed  by the participant at any time during the study, when the 
participant feels it’s necessary. Each caregiver should receive the caregiver information 
letter before providing support to the study participant. Ideally, a single caregiver should 
be appointed b y the participant but, in some situations, it may happen that several 
caregivers will support a study participant throughout the conduct of the study (for 
example in LTCF setting). This should be recorded in the source documents.  
Caregivers may help the st udy participants with performing some practical study 
procedures such as receiving or making phone calls to study staff, planning study visits, 
transcribing responses to questionnaires and diaries, performing the nasal swab, 
transportation to and from the study site, etc. However, at no time, the caregiver should 
evaluate the participant’s health status while answering diaries and/or questionnaires or 
make decisions on behalf of the participant. At the time of recruitment, the study staff 
should inform the participant of the possibility to appoint a caregiver. Then, at each study 
visit with the exception of the end of study visits (Visit 7NH/Visit 5SH) , the site staff 
should check with the participant if he/she wishes to appoint a caregiver or if there were 
or will be changes in caregiver.  
Please refer to the SPM for additional information on the appointment of a caregiver .

After completing all prerequisite procedures prior to vaccination, one dose of study  
vaccine will be prepared and administered as shown  in Table 11 for Dose 1 and Table 12 
for the annual revaccination. Refer to Section 4.1 for the schedule of vaccine 
administration.  
Note that the RSVPreF3 OA investigational vaccine must be reconstituted before 
administration. Refer to the SPM for instructions on study vaccine reconstitution.  
The participants must be observed closely for at least  30 minutes after the administration 
of the vaccine. Appropriate medical treatment  must be readily available during the 
observation period in case of anaphylaxis and/or syncope.  
For Dose 1:  
The RSVPreF3 study groups will receive adjuvanted vaccine consisting of unique 
combinations of RSVPreF3 antigen lots, i.e., Lot 1, Lot 2, Lot 3 or L ot 4, and 
extemporaneously reconstituted with AS01 E adjuvant lots, i.e., Lot A, Lot B, Lot  C and 
Lot D. It will result in 4 unique combinations. Before Season 1 in Part 1, the first 
3 unique combinations (Lot 1/Lot A, Lot 2/Lot B, Lot 3/Lot C) will be assi gned 
randomly to the participants in the first 3 RSVPreF3 OA investigational vaccine lot 
groups. Before Season 1 in Part 2, the RSVPreF3 group will receive the 4th unique 
combination (Lot 4/Lot D) . Refer to Section 4.1 for details on the study design and 
Section 6.3.2  for details on the randomizati on. 
For the annual revaccination:  
The RSV_annual group  will receive an additional dose of RSVPreF3 OA vaccine before 
each subsequent RSV season  while the RSV_1dose and Placebo groups will receive 1 
dose of placebo at the same timepoint s*. Refer to Section 4.1 for details on the study 
design.

The study vaccine  must be stored in a safe, locked place  at the temperature specified on 
the vaccine label. The storage temperature should be continuously monitored with 
calibrated (if not validated) temperature monitoring device(s) and recorded. Only 
authorized  study personnel sho uld be allo wed access to the study vaccine . Storage 
conditions will be assessed by a sponsor study contact during pre -study activities. Refer 
to the section on Study Supplies in the SPM for more details on storage and handling of 
the study vaccine .

Protocol Amendment 5 Final  
12 July 2023  63 6.3.2.  Randomi zation to study intervention  (Amended, 12 July 2023)  
For Dose 1, the randomization will be stratified by part:  
• In Part 1, the study participants will be randomly assigned in a 1:1:1:3 ratio to 1 of 
the 4  study groups a t Visit 1 (Day 1).  
• In Part 2, the study participants will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to 1 of the 
2 study groups at Visit 1 (Day 1).  Part 2 will be initiated when the vaccine lots for 
Part 1 are no longer available at the study sites.  
To allow GSK to take advantage of greater rates of recruitment in this multi -center study 
and to thus reduce the overall study recruitment period, an over -randomization of 
supplies will be prepared.  
At Visit 3 (pre -Season 2), all participants who received 1 of the RSVP reF3 vaccine lots  
will be re -randomized in a 1:1 ratio into 2  sub-groups (RSV_annual group and 
RSV_1dose group) to receive annual revaccination  (Dose 2 and Dose 3 * in NH and Dose 
2 in SH) . 
* Participants in the NH who will have their Visit 5NH after  the approval  of the 
current Protocol Amendment 5 will not receive any study intervention at pre -Season  3 
visit (Visit 5NH).  
The randomization of supplies within blocks will be performed at GSK, using MATerial 
EXcellence (MAtEx), a program developed for use in St atistical Analysis System (SAS) 
(Cary, NC, United States [US]) by GSK. Entire blocks will be shipped to the study 
centers/warehouse(s).  
6.3.3.  Intervention allocation to the participant  
An automated internet -based system (Source data Base for Internet Randomization 
[SBIR]) will be used for randomization and for identification of intervention material. 
For Dose 1  in Part 1, t he system’s randomization algorithm will use a  stratification by 
subset (participants included in reactogenicity/immunogenicity sub set or not)  and a 
minimization procedure accounting for center, age and region within each subset . For 
Dose 1 in Part  2, the system’s randomization algorithm will use a minimization procedure 
accounting for center, age and region . Minimization factors will  have equal weight in the 
minimization algorithm.  
The intervention numbers will be allocated by component.  
Upon providing the participant identification number and the participant’s category for 
all minimization factors, the randomization system will determine the study group and 
will provide the intervention  number to be used for the vaccination.  
CONFIDENTIAL  
212494 (RSV OA=ADJ -006) 
Protocol Amendment 5 Final  
12 July 2023  64 When all participants will be randomized for their Dose 1 in the SBIR system, a re -
randomization will be run as follows:  
• The randomization file related to Do se 1 will be extracted from SBIR.  
• A re-randomization of the participants included in the RSVPreF3 groups will be 
prepared to identify which of those participants will be allocated to the RSV_annual 
groups or to the RSV_1dose groups in a 1:1 ratio.  
This re -randomization will be accounting for:  
− The different stratification and minimization factors used for the initial 
randomization: part (Part 1 or Part 2), subset (participants included in 
reactogenicity/immunogenicity subset or not), center, age and region;  
− The RSVPreF3 OA investigational vaccine lot allocated for Dose 1 (Lot 1, 2, 3 
or 4).  
• The updated randomization file including the allocation of participants to one of the 
2 groups for each lot (RSV_annual group  or RSV_1dose group) will be uploaded in 
SBIR . 
The re -randomization file will be prepared by an unblinded independent statistician. It 
will not be accounting for any data collected in the eCRF, but only for data collected in 
SBIR for the allocation to the initial study group.  
Upon providing the parti cipant identification number, the randomization system will 
provide the intervention  number to be used for the re -vaccination doses.  
When SBIR is not available, please refer to the SBIR user guide or SPM for specific 
instructions.  
Refer to the SPM for addi tional information relative to the intervention number  
allocation.  
6.3.4.  Allocation of participants to assay subsets  
Evaluation of solicited events and the humoral immune response  will be performed in a  
subset of participant s, referred to as r eactogenicity and immunogenicity subset . This 
subset will include a pproximately 1800 participant s (corresponding to ~ 7% of the total 
study population) from the 3 RSVPreF3  OA investigational vaccine lot groups and 
placebo group  (1:1:1:3  ratio) in Part 1 , including participan ts from NH and SH, as 
indicated in  Table 13.

Participants contributing to the reactogenicity and immunogenicity subset will be 
recruited from a selected number of  countries and selected number of sites. In the 
selected sites, the investigator will allocate the first participants in each age category to 
the reactogenicity and immunogenicity subset until the allocated target is reached.  
At time of randomization for D ose 1, the subset will be entered in SBIR as stratification 
factor. A randomization blocking scheme (1:1:1:3 ratio) will be used to ensure that 
balance between interventions is maintained. The randomization algorithm will use a 
minimization procedure accou nting for center, age and region within the subset. All 
minimization factors will have equal weight in the minimization algorithm.  
6.3.5.  Blinding and unblinding   
Data will be collected in an observer -blind manner. To do so, vaccine will be prepared 
and administe red by qualified study personnel (unblinded) who will not participate in 
data collection, evaluation  or review of any study endpoint (i.e. , reactogenicity, safety, 
efficacy).  
The unblinded study personnel are allowed to transcribe source data into the eCRF 
without interpretation or generation of data.  
The laboratory in charge of the sample testing will be blinded to the intervention 
assignment. Codes will be used to link the participant and study (without any link to the 
intervention attributed to the participant) to each sample.  
At different analyses, there will be a risk of individual unblinding. Given that summary 
safety results may unblind some specific participants (e.g. , an AE occurring only in a 
single g roup), anyone having access to these analyses could become unblinded regarding 
that specific case. In order to maintain the whole team (Central, Local, Investigators) and 
participants blinded at the individual participant level , a firewall team will be set  up. This 
firewall team will  allow all analyses until the implementation of Protocol Amendment 4  
to be performed and results reported to the relevant authorities while the study blind is 
maintained.  In case no participant is reported in 1 group (e.g. , a certain event being only 
reported in participants in the other  study group), the blinding of results is managed by an 
CONFIDENTIAL  
212494 (RSV OA=ADJ -006) 
Protocol Amendment 5 Final  
12 July 2023  66 Independent External Statistician (IES).  In this situation, exact results per group are not 
provided  to the blinded team members and the investigators . The firewall team will 
review the results before they are distributed to the study team, to prevent these data 
potentially leading to unblinding at participant level of the study team. Further details of 
this approach can be found in the firewall charter.  
For analyses planned a s of the implementation of Protocol Amendment 4, GSK RSV OA 
team members  will be unblinded at the individual participant level  in order to support the 
regulatory activities and study  results  interpretation , with the exception of GSK  RSV OA 
team members  involved in clinical evaluation (i.e. , personnel involved in data review and 
validation , ARI/LRTD case adjudication, lab oratory  testing) , study participants, 
investigators and site perso nnel involved in  the clinical evaluation of the participants , 
who will remain blinded at the individual participant level up to end of study. In case no 
participant is reported in 1 group (e.g. , a certain event being only reported in participants 
in the other study group), exact results per group will not be provided to blinded team 
members and the investigators. The firewall team will no  longer be active.  
A participant may continue in the study if that participant’s intervention assignment is 
unblinde d (see Sections 6.3.5.1  and 6.3.5.2 ). 
6.3.5.1.  Emerge ncy unblinding   
Unblinding a participant’s individual intervention number should occur ONLY in case of 
a medical emergency when knowledge of the intervention is essential for the clinical 
management or welfare of the participant.  
The emergency unblinding process enables the investigator to have unrestricted, 
immediate and direct access to the participant’s individual study intervention  via SBIR . 
As back -up process, the investigator has the option of contacting a GSK Helpdesk (refer  
to the Table 14) if he/she needs help performing the unblinding (i.e. , he/she cannot access 
SBIR ). 
A non -investigator physician (e.g. , physician from emergency room) or 
participant/caregiver member may also request emergency unblinding either via the 
investigator (preferred option) or via the GSK Helpdesk (back -up process). The 
patient/participant card lists contact information for both the investigator and GSK 
Helpdesk.  
GSK’s Global Safety staff may unblind the intervention assignment for any participant 
with a n SAE. If the SAE requires that an expedited regulatory report be sent to one or 
more regulatory agencies, a copy of the report, identifying the participant’s intervention 
assignment, may be sent to investigators in accordance with local regulations and/or GSK 
policy.

6.3.5.2.  Emergency unblinding prior to regulatory reporting of SAEs  
GSK policy (which incorporates ICH E2A guidance, the EU Clinical Trial Directive and 
US Federal Regulations) is to unblind the report of any unexpected SAE and which is 
attributable/suspected to be attributable to the study vaccine, prior to regulatory reporting. 
Vaccines Clinical Safety and Pharmacovigilance (VCSP) is responsible for unblinding 
the intervention assignment in accordance with the specified timeframes for expedited 
reporting of SAEs (refer to the Section  10.3.10.1 ). 
In addition, GSK VCSP staff may unblind the intervention assignment for any participant 
with a Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction (SUS AR) or a Serious Adverse 
Event  that is fatal or life -threatening. If the SAE requires an expedited regulatory report 
be sent to 1 or more regulatory agencies, a copy of the report, identifying the participant’s 
intervention assignment, may be sent to inves tigators in accordance with local regulations 
and/or GSK policy.

As this is an observer -blind study, vaccine preparation and administration will be done by 
authorized medical personnel who will not participate in any of the st udy clinical 
evaluation assays. Vaccination will be performed under medical supervision. The date of 
each dose administ ration  will be recorded in the source documents and in the eCRF.  
6.5. Concomitant therapy  (Amended, 12 July 2023 ) 
At each study visit/contact,  the investigator or delegate should question the participant 
about any medications/products taken and vaccinations received by the participant.  
The following concomitant medication(s)/product(s)/vaccine(s) must be recorded in the 
eCRF:  
• All concomitant med ication, except vitamins and dietary supplements, administered 
during the 30 -day period following each dose of study vaccine (Day 1 to Day 30 
after each dose).  
• All concomitant vaccination during the entire study period.  
• All concomitant medication including  vaccines/products which may explain/cause/be 
used to treat an SAE/pIMD as defined in Section s 8.3.1  and 10.3.8 . These  must also 
be recorded on the Expedited Adverse Event report.  
• For all  AF AESIs (including serious and non -serious) , concomitant  drugs which 
could be associated with development or worsening of AF must  be reported in the 
AF follow -up questionnaire.  
• Any prophylactic medication (e.g. , analgesics, antipyretics) administered on each  
study vaccination day (Day 1 , pre-Season 2  and pre -Season 3 *) in the absence of 
ANY symptom and in anticipation of a reaction to the vaccination.  
* Not applicable for participants in the NH who will have their Visit 5NH after the 
approval  of the current Protocol Amendment 5 and will not receive any study 
intervention at pre -Season  3 visit (Visit 5NH) .  
• All concomitant medications taken for the treatment of an ARI (including prescribed 
drugs [e.g. antibiotics] and self -treatment) or for an ARI -related complication.  
• All concomitant medications including vaccines/products leading to discontinuation 
of the study intervention or an elimination from the analysis (refer to Section 5.2.2  
for details).  
Refer to  Table 15 for an overview of the timing for recording of concomitant medication 
during the study.

7. DISCONTINUATION OF S TUDY INTERVENTION AN D 
PARTICIPANT DISCONTI NUATION/WITHDRAWAL  
7.1. Discontinuation of study intervention  (Amended , 12 July 
2023)  
‘Discontinuation’ of study intervention means any participant who has not received all 
planned doses of vaccine. A participant who discontinued study intervention may, if 
deemed appropriate by the investigator, continue other study procedures (e.g. , subsequent 
dose, efficacy, safety or immunogenicity) if planned in the study pro tocol.  
The primary reason for premature discontinuation of the study intervention will be 
documented in the eCRF based on the following:  
• Adverse event requiring expedited reporting to GSK  
• Unsolicited non -serious AE  
• Solicited event  
• Not willing to be vaccinated  
• Other (specify).  
Refer to Section 7.1.2  for contraindications to subsequent vaccination. Refer to Section  
10.5.2  (glossary of terms) for the definition of intervention.  
Participants who do not consent for the annual revaccination will be considered 
withdrawals from the study.  
7.1.1.  Criteria for temporar y delay for enrol lment and/or vaccination  
Study vaccine  administration may be postponed within the permitted time frame for each 
study vaccination within eac h country until transient circumstances cited below are 
resolved:  
• Acute disease and/or fever at the time of vaccination. Fever is defined as a 
temperature ≥ 38.0°C/100.4°F by any route. The route  for measuring temperature 
can be oral , axillary or tympanic . 
CONFIDENTIAL  
212494 (RSV OA=ADJ -006) 
Protocol Amendment 5 Final  
12 July 2023  71 • Participants with symptoms suggestive of active Coronavirus Disea se 2019 (COVID -
19) infection (e.g. fever, cough, etc.). The return to the site of the participant will 
follow the specific guidance from local public health and other competent authorities 
(e.g., free of symptoms, COVID -19 negative testing,  etc.). 
• Particip ants with known COVID -19 positive contacts within the past 14 days may be 
vaccinated  at the discretion of the investigator at least 14 days after the exposure if 
the participant  remains symptom free.  
• Participants with a minor illness (such as mild diarrh ea, mild upper respiratory 
infection) without fever may be vaccinated at the discretion of the investigator.  
• In case of administration of inactivated and subunit influenza vaccines: 
Postponement of study vaccine  administration  within given protocol timelines to 
allow respect of  the 14 day -interval between flu vaccination and study vaccine  
administration . 
Refer to Table  5 and Table 6 in Section 1.3 for the allowed time intervals  in Northern and 
Southern hemisp heres, respectively . 
7.1.2.  Contraindications to subsequent vaccine administration  
(Amended, 12 July 2023)  
Participants must be evaluated to confirm that there are no contraindications  for 
subsequent vaccination before administering each additional study vaccine dose.  
Participants who meet any of the criteria listed below or criteria listed in Sections 5.2.1 , 
5.2.2  and 5.2.3  should not receive  additional  vaccinations . However, these participants 
should be encouraged to continue other study procedures at the discretion of the 
investigator (Section 10.3.8.2 ). The relevant criteria for discontinuing vaccination must 
be recorded in the eCRF.  
• Participants  who experience any SAE judged to be possibly or probably related to 
the study vaccine or non -study concomitant vaccines, including hypersensitivity 
reactions.  
• Participants who develop any new condition which, in the opinion of the 
investigator, may pose additional risk to the participant if he/she continues to 
participate in the study.  
• Occurrence of  a new pIMD  or the exacerbation of an existing pIMD that, in the 
opinion of the investigator, exposes the participant to unacceptable risk from 
subsequent vaccination. In such cases, the investigator should use his/her clinical 
judgment prior to administer ing the next dose of the vaccine. Refer to Section 
10.3.5.1  for the definition of pIMDs.  
Note: This section  is not applicable at pre -Season 3 visit for participants  in the NH  who 
will have their Visit 5NH after the approval  of the current Protocol Amendment 5 and

Protocol Amendment 5 Final  
12 July 2023  72 7.2. Participant discontinuation/withdrawal from the study  
A participant i s considered a ‘withdrawal’ from the study when no study procedure has 
occurred, no follow -up has been performed and no further information has been collected 
for this participant from the date of withdrawal/last contact.  
From an analysis perspective, a ‘w ithdrawal’ from the study refers to any participant who 
did not return  for the concluding visit  foreseen in the protocol.  Investigators will attempt 
to contact those participants who do not return for scheduled visits or follow -up. All data 
and samples col lected until the date of withdrawal/last contact of the participant will be 
used for the analysis.  
The primary reason for study withdrawal will be documented in the eCRF based on the 
list below:  
• AEs requiring expedited  reporting to GSK (refer to Section 10.3.10.1  for details)  
• Unsolicited non -serious  AE 
• Solicited event  
• Withdrawal by participant, not due to an AE* 
• Migrated/ moved from the study area  
• Lost to follow -up 
• Sponsor study termination  
• Other (specify) . 
* If a participant is withdrawn from the study because he/she has withdrawn consent and 
provided the reason for its withdrawal, the investigator must document this reason in the 
eCRF.  
Participants who are withdrawn from the study because of SAEs/AEs must be clearly 
distinguished from participants who are withdrawn for other reasons. Investigators will 
follow participants who are withdrawn from the study as result of an SAE/AE until the 
event is resolved (see Section 10.3.8.2 ). 
7.3. Lost to follow -up 
A participant will be considered ‘lost to follow -up’ if he or she fails to return for 
scheduled visits and is unable to be contacted by the study site.  
Please refer to the SPM for a description of the actions to be taken before considering the 
participant as lost to follow -up.

12 July 2023  73 8. STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND PROC EDURES  
(AMENDED , 12 JULY 2023)  
Study p rocedures and their timing s are summari zed in  Table 1 and Table 2 for 
participants in NH, Table 3 for participants in SH and Table  4 for ARI surveillance 
(Section  1.3). The intervals between study visits are  provided in Table  5, Table 6 and 
Table 7, respectively.  Study visits should preferably be done on site or in the LTCF. If 
deemed necessary  and not possible for study participant to come to site , study visits can 
be done at home.  
Adherence to the protocol is required for study conduct.  
Protocol waivers or exemptions are not allowed unless necessary for the management  of 
an immediate safety concern . 
Immediate safety concerns should be discussed with the sponsor as soon as they occur or 
when the study team is aware of them. The purpose of this communication is to 
determine if the participant(s) should discontinue the study intervention.  
The SPM provides the investigator and site personnel with administrative and detailed 
technical information that does not impact participant safety.  
During special circumstances (e.g., COVID -19 pandemic), the specific guidance from 
local public health and other competent authorities regarding the protection of 
individuals’ welfare must be applied. For the duration of such special circumstances, the 
following measures may be implemented for enrolled participants:  
• Safety follow -up may be made by a telephone call, other means of virtual contact or 
home visit  (from the site staff or from home care service system) , if appropriate.  
• Diary cards may be transmitted fro m and to the site by electronic or conventional 
mail or collected at the participant’s  residence . 
• Visits for suspected ARI may take place in a different location* other than the study 
site or at participant’s home. If this is not feasible, then the medical  evaluation of 
ARI may take place virtually with documentation of ARI symptom s and other 
relevant ARI information  by phone or other means of virtual live contact . 
• Biological samples may be collected at a different location* other than the study site 
or at participant’s home. Biological samples should not be collected if they cannot be 
processed in a timely manner or appropriately stored until the intended use.  
• Throat and/or nasal swab samples collected at ARI visits may be taken by someone 
else than the site staff (for example , a swab sample may be taken by the participant 
or caregiver)  with site staff supervision and guidance , if required by local 
regulations.  
CONFIDENTIAL

Protocol Amendment 5 Final  
12 July 2023  74 • If despite best efforts it is not possible to perform the ARI visit  within the interval 
pre-defined in the protocol (see Table 7) (for example in case of suspected COVID -
19 infection and pending  COVID -19 test result, or self -quarantine) , then the interval 
for this visit may be extended up to maximum 14 days after ARI onset  (i.e., until 
Day 15, refer to Figure 3 for ARI flow) . In any case , the participant should be 
encour aged to take the self -swab as per  protocol (i.e., preferably within 48 hours 
after ARI onset but not later than 5 days after ARI onset) to maximize the chance to 
detect the virus.  
* It is the investigator’s responsibility to identify an alternate location.  The investigator 
should ensure that this alternate location meets ICH GCP requirements, such as 
adequate facilities to perform study procedures, appropriate training of the staff and 
documented delegation of responsibilities in this location. This alterna te location should 
be covered by proper insurance for the conduct of study on participants by investigator 
and staff at a site other than the designated study site. Refer to EMA Guidance on the 
Management of Clinical Trials during the COVID -19 (Coronavirus ) pandemic (version 
2, 27 March, 2020) for more details.  
Refer to the SPM for further details on decentralized clinical trial solutions.

8.1.1.1.  ARI surveillance period and methods  
Surveillance for detection of ARI episodes will be carried out during the entire study , via 
spontaneous reporting by the study participant (starting on the day of first vaccination* 
[Visit  1]) and by scheduled site staff contacts (starting from Visit 2 onwards)  with 
different frequencies of contact during the RSV seasons and the inter -season periods . 
Based on the observed RSV circulation during the season , the ARI surveillance and/or 
the DLP for analyses could be adapted for the ongoing and/or  subsequent seasons . Refer 
to Figure 2 for details on ARI surveillance.  ARI episodes will be captured via 2 
complementary methods: 1)  spontaneous reporting by the participant (see Section 
8.1.1.4 ) scheduled site staff contacts (see Section 8.1.1.4 ). 
* For detailed information on activities involved in ARI surveillance , refer to  Table  4. 
Swab samples will be taken in all participants meeting pre -specified criteria for ARI case 
definition (see Table 10 in Section 4.2.1 ). Diagnosis and treatment of each ARI should be 
performed according to the local standard of care.

12 July 2023  75 8.1.1.1.1.  Nasal self -swab training with the study participant  
At Visit 2, the study participants may be invited to practice a nasal self -swab in the 
presence of site staff to guide them through the instructions and the procedure. The n asal 
self-swab training can be repeated at any subsequent visit if the participant raises the need 
for a new training. This swab should be discarded after the training, it should not be sent 
to the central laboratory . 
ARI surveillance starts as of Visit 1,  however no nasal self -swab will be requested from 
the participant for ARI episode s occurring before Visit 2.  
8.1.1.2.  Definitions for ARI surveillance  
• ARI onset (Day 1):  will be defined as the first day when the study participant 
presents at least 2 concomitant  ARI symptoms /signs  meeting the ARI case definition  
(see Table 10 in Section 4.2.1 ). The ARI case must be confirmed by the 
investigator/ site staff  or delegate during the ARI visit.  
Note: The start and end date of each individual symptom  and the presence/absence of 
each sign  will be recorded in the eCRF. It may happen that the start date of an 
individual symptom/sign is before  the ARI onset date, if the first symptom/sign 
started before the second symptom/sign needed to reach the ARI case definition.  
• ARI end: will be defined a s the first day when all ARI symptoms/signs of the 
participant have returned to baseline or when they diminished  significantly as judged 
by the investigator . 
• New ARI episode: An ARI episode will be considered as a new episode only after 
the resolution of the previous one. Between 2 ARI episodes, there must be at least 
7 days free of symptoms/signs (or at baseline level) or at least 7 days with 
significantly diminished symptoms/ signs as judged by the investigator.  
• Complications: The following complications of interest will be collected through 
the entire study, starting on the first vaccination day (Visit 1) . The relationship of 
these complications to an ARI episode will be asses sed by the investigator.  
− Respiratory complications : 
• Pneumonia : A clinical diagnosis of pneumonia based on signs and 
symptoms, with or without chest radiograph that demonstrates a new or 
progressive infiltrate.  
• New diagnosis of COPD or exacerbation of COPD : A new diagnosis of 
COPD or, in a participant with previously diagnosed COPD, a worsening of 
COPD necessitating to increase the dosage or modify the treatment 
administered.  
• New diagnosis of asthma or exacerbation of asthma : A new diagnosis of 
asthma or, in  a participant with previously diagnosed asthma, a worsening 
of asthma necessitating to increase the dosage or modify the treatment 
administered.  
CONFIDENTIAL  
212494 (RSV OA=ADJ -006) 
Protocol Amendment 5 Final  
12 July 2023  76 • Other respiratory complications: Other diagnosis of respiratory illness , 
including new diagnosis or exacerbation of a pre -existing respiratory 
disease (e.g. , emphysema, chronic bronchitis) . 
− Non-respiratory complications:  
• New onset or worsening congestive heart failure (CHF),  
• Myocardial inf arction (MI),  
• Stroke , 
• Diabetes , 
• Other non -respiratory complications judged related to an ARI episode by 
the Investigator.  
8.1.1.3.  ARI capture and follow -up 
ARI episodes will be captured via 2 complementary methods: 1) spontaneous reporting 
by the participant  and 2) scheduled site staff contacts . 
Each ARI episode (including if several episodes occur in the same participant) will be 
assigned a sequential case number. All relevant ARI information will be reported in a 
specific ARI eCRF screen.  
8.1.1.4.  Spontaneous reporting by the participant  
Participants wil l be instructed to contact spontaneously the investigator/site staff 
promptly if they experience at least 2 ARI symptoms/signs (see Table 10 in Section 
4.2.1 ). The surveillance for ARI will start on the first vaccination day (Visit 1). At Visit 
1, participants will be provided with instruction materia l to guide them in the detection of 
ARI symptoms/signs.  At Visit 2, participants will be invited to practice  nasal self -swab 
collection (refer to Section 8.1.1.1.1 ). Note that no nasal self -swab will be requested from 
the participant for ARI episode s occurring before Visit 2.  
At each study visit/contact, participants should be reminded to contact the 
investigator/site staff if they experience respirator y symptoms meeting the ARI case 
definition.  
8.1.1.5.  Scheduled site staff contacts  (Amended, 12 July 2023 ) 
As of Visit 2 onwards, t he site staff will contact the participants regularly during the 
entire study to check if they have experienced any respiratory symptoms meeting the ARI 
case definition (see Table 10 in Section 4.2.1 ). These contacts will be performed:  
• every 2 weeks during the RSV seasons,  
• every month during the inter -season periods.  
The RSV seasons defined for this study are from 1  October to 30  April in NH  and from 
1 March to 30  September in SH.

NH: Northern hemisphere; SH: Southern hemisphere.  
In some SH countries, recruitment might start during an RSV Season (Season 0).  
Surveillance for ARI will be carried out during the entire study, via spontaneous reporting by the study participant 
(starting on the day of  first vaccination [Visit 1]) and by scheduled site staff contact s (starting from V isit 2 onwards)  with 
different frequencies of contact during the RSV seasons and the inter -season periods.  
The site staff surveillance contacts will be performed: every 2 weeks during the RSV seasons (Solid blue ) and every 
month during the inter -season per iods (Shaded blue). The RSV seasons defined for this study are: from 1  October to 
30 April in NH and from 1  March to 30  September in SH.  Based on the observed RSV circulation during the season , 
the ARI surveillance and/or the DLP for analyses could be adap ted for the ongoing and/or subsequent seasons.  
Note: If following the sample size re -assessment an additional cohort needs to be enrolled before the next season in 
NH (see Section 9.2.3 ), similar ARI surveillance will apply up to the end of the third season for those participants. 
Study Year 1 corresponds to the year in which the enrollment started for the cohort.  
* The last study visit in SH (Visit  5 SH) will occur  approximately 2 months after the start of Season 3 in SH ; yet the site 
staff surveillance contacts will be performed monthly during these last months ( i.e., continuation of the inter -season 
frequency of contacts).  
Multiple formats can be proposed by the site staff to organize the se surveillance contacts. 
This may be done via e -mail, text message , fax or phone call for example, or via a visit 
for LTCF participants. The most appropriate format should be agreed between  site staff 
and the study participant. Text messages, e -mail and fax may be used as a screening to 
check if the participant has anything to report. If the participant answers yes for at least 
one of the items of interest, a phone call must be done to get t he details on the event(s). 
Receipt of the message must be confirmed by the participant or caregiver, as applicable.  
At each scheduled  contact, participants will be asked if they have experienced:  
• Any symptoms/signs  meeting the ARI case definition (see Table 10 in Section 4.2.1 ). 
• Any of the following respiratory complications:  
− Pneumonia  
− New diagnosis of COPD or exacerbation of COPD  
− New diagnosis of asthma or exacerbation of asthma

12 July 2023  79 Figure 3 ARI capture and follow -up 
 
The ARI visit should preferably be done on site or in the LTCF. If deemed necessary , the ARI visit can be done at 
home.  ARI follow -up contacts on Day 15, Day 29 and the additional follow -up contact can be done via phone calls or 
visit to the LTCF.  
Nasal self -swab  collection  and completi on of  daily health questionnaires are not applicable for ARI episodes reported 
before  Visit 2. 
* In special circumstances (for example in case of suspected COVID -19 infection and pending  COVID -19 test result, or 
self-quarantine ) and if it is not possible to perform the ARI visit within 6 days after ARI onset (i.e. , within Day 3 to Day 
7), then the interval for this visit may be extended up to maximum 14 days after ARI onset (i.e. , until Day 15) . If the ARI 
visit takes place between Da y 10 and Day 15 , then the first follow -up contact may be skipped.  
In case of at least 2 concomitant  ARI symptoms /signs  identified by the participant, the 
following visits and contacts will take place ( refer to  Table 7 for the interval s allowed for 
each contact):  
• Participant’s call (Day 2):  Within 24 hours of the appearance of at least 
2 concomitant ARI symptoms/signs , the participant should call the site st aff. During 
the phone call:  
− Record ARI symptoms /signs : The site staff will record the ARI 
symptoms /signs  reported by the participant in the eCRF and record the onset 
date of each symptom mentioned during the call.  
− Schedule ARI visit:  The site staff  will organize an ARI visit within the per  
protocol window.  (Refer to the note for special circumstances in the ARI visit 
detailed below).  
− Reminders for participant procedures : The participant should be reminded by 
site staff  to take a nasal self -swab  (Note: this is not applicable for ARI episodes 
reported before Visit 2) . The self -collected swab should be done preferably 
within 48  hours of ARI onset but not later than 5 days after ARI onset. The

the swab sample. The self -swab should be returned to the study site within 
2 days after collection or, if not feasible within 2 days, the swab should be 
returned to site as soon as possible . 
− Reminder to start completing the daily health questionnaires : The 
questionnaires  should be completed from the participant’s call (Day 2) until the 
end of the ARI episode or for maximum 14 consecutive days (i.e., from Day 2 
until Day 15 at the latest)  (Note: this is not applicable for ARI episod es reported 
before Visit 2) . Each study site should define upfront the most appropriate 
method(s) for collection of questionnaires completed by the participant (via 
mail, service courier, or other).  
• ARI visit (Days 3 -7)*: The ARI visit should take place soon after ARI onset, ideally 
48 hours after ARI onset, but no later than 6 days after ARI onset. Ideally, and in 
most cases, the ARI visit should be scheduled at least 1 day after the participant’s 
self-swab ** (i.e., the nasal  self-swab taken by the participant and the nasal and throat 
swab  samples taken by the qualified site staff should not be done on the same day).  If 
for logistical or  medical reason s the ARI visit must be schedule d on the same day 
than the participant call, it is recommended to take the nasal and throat swab during 
the visit and to omit the self-swab ** taken by the participant , but this should remain 
exceptional . 
* Note: In special c ircumstances, (for example in case of suspected COVID -19 
infection and pending  COVID -19 test result , or self -quarantine ) and if it is not 
possible to perform the ARI visit within 6 days after ARI onset (i.e. , within Day 3 to 
Day 7) , then the interval for ARI visit may be extended up to maximum 14 days after 
ARI onset (i.e. , until Day 15) . If the ARI visit occurs within 7 to 9 days  after ARI 
onset  (i.e., within Day 8 to Day 10), then the remaining follow -up contacts (i.e. , Day 
15 and Day 29 ) should be performed  as described below. If the ARI visit occurs 
between 10 to 14 days a fter ARI onset  (i.e., within Day 11 to Day 15) , then the first 
follow -up contact  (i.e., Day 15  contact ) can be skip ped; the next contact will be  the 
Day 29 contact. In any case , the participant should be encouraged to take the self -
swab as per  protocol (i.e., preferably within 48 hours after ARI onset but not later 
than 5  days after ARI onset) to maximize the chance to detect the virus.  
** Note: the nasal self -swab collection is not applicable for ARI episodes reported 
before Visit 2.  
During the ARI visi t the following procedure should be performed  (refer also to 
Table  4 in Section 1.3): 
− Physical examination, body temperature and vital signs:  refer to Section 
8.2.2 . 
− Pulse oximetry:  refer to Section 8.2.2.4 . 
− Confirmation of ARI:  The investigator  or designee  will confirm if the event 
meets the ARI case definition ( see Table 10 in Section 4.2.1 ). 
If the ARI is NOT confirmed , the investigator or design ee will rec ord the 
alternative diagnosis in the eCRF. No other swab sample should be taken and 
other ARI -related procedures should not be performed. The participant should 
CONFIDENTIAL  
212494 (RSV OA=ADJ -006) 
Protocol Amendment 5 Final  
12 July 2023  81 be instructed to stop completing the daily health questionnaires . Refer to the 
SPM for details on the handling of self -swab samples and the daily health  
questionnaires in case ARI is not confirmed. The management of the participant 
illness should  follow local standard of care.  
If the ARI is confirmed  (i.e., the event met the ARI case definition) , the 
investigator or designee  will record the ARI information in the eCRF and follow 
all ARI -related procedures ( see Table  4 in Section 1.3). The ARI episode should 
be treated accordingly to local standard of c are. 
− Record ARI information: The investigator or designee will assess clinical 
signs and/or symptoms of ARI , record the onset date of each symptom 
diagnosed/mentioned during the visit  and record the presence/absence of each 
sign detected based on auscultat ion. The investigator should provide a clinical 
diagnosis and assess the intensity of the ARI according to the intensity grading 
provided in Table 16 . 
If any laboratory testing is performed locally for the identification of respiratory 
pathogens for the ARI, the date of the testing, method of test, specimen material 
type, the results and the references of commercial PCR diagnostic kit (if 
applicable) should be recorded in the eCRF.  
Table 16 Intensity grading for ARI /LRTD  episode  
Mild = An ARI/LRTD episode  which is easily tolerated by the participant, causing minimal 
discomfort and not interfering with everyday activities.  
Moderate  = An ARI/LRTD episode  which is sufficiently discomforting to interfere with normal everyday 
activities.  
Severe  = An ARI/LRTD episode  which prevents normal, everyday activities. Such an event would, 
for example, prevent attendance at work and would necessitate the administration of 
corrective therapy.  
− Record date of self -swab:  The site staff  will record in the eCRF the date when 
the self -swab was taken by the participant  (Note: this is not applicable for ARI 
episodes reported before Visit 2) . 
− Nasal and throat swab sampling:  For each ARI reported after the first 
vaccination visit (Visit 1), q ualified staff from the study team will collect one 
swab of cells and secretions from each nostril and one swab from throat. After 
collection , both swabs will be placed in the same tube. Full details for obtaining 
nasal and throat sample are provided in the SPM.  
The swab samples will allow to assess the potential RSV and hMPV infections 
by RT -PCR at a sponsor or sponsor -designated laboratory.  
− Record treatment presc ribed/self -treatment:  Any medication taken for ARI 
(including self -medication) since ARI onset until resolution of the episode will 
be recorded in the eCRF with medical indication and start/end dates of the 
treatment. The same will be applicable to medication (s) prescribed to treat any 
ARI-related  complications.

12 July 2023  82 − Collection of HCRU:  Each participant will be asked to answer questions on 
healthcare utilization since ARI onset until resolution of the episode . Refer to 
Section 8.10.2  for an overview of HCRU data to be recorded in the participant’s 
eCRF.  
− HR-QoL questionnaires:  Participants will be asked to complete HR -QoL 
questionnaires (EQ-5D and SF -12) during the ARI visit.  All HR-QoL 
questionnaires will be completed by the participant (or with the assistance of 
their caregiver in case of physical incapacity)  in the presence of site staff . 
− Reminders:  The participants should be reminded to contact the site staff  if the 
ARI worsen s. The need for additional visit s or contacts for the medical 
management of the ARI should be assessed by the investigator  and follow the 
local standard of care.  
The p articipant will also be reminded to complete the daily health questionnaires  
until the end of the ARI or for maximum 14 days  (Note: this is not applicable for 
ARI episodes reported before Visit 2) . 
− Recording of A Es, SAEs and other events of interest:  refer to Section 8.3. 
− Distribution of new material:  At each ARI visit (regardless , if the ARI is 
confirmed or not) , the site staff should distribute new self -swabbing material and 
new daily health  questionnaires to the study partic ipant for the next ARI episode  
(Note: this is not applicable for ARI episodes reported before Visit 2) . 
• ARI follow -up contact (Day 15):  Each ARI episode will be followed  up by the 
investigator/ site staff  through an ARI follow -up contact (phone call or visit to the 
LTCF) approximately  14 days after ARI onset. If due to special circumstances (for 
example a suspected COVID -19 infection or pending  COVID -19 test result, or self -
quarantine) , the ARI visit occurs between 10 to 14 days after ARI onset (i.e. , within 
Day 11 to Day 15) , then the first follow -up contact (i.e. , Day 15 contact) can be 
skipped; the next contact will be the Day 29 contact . 
− ARI follow -up information  will be recorded in the eCRF: onset and end date of 
each symptom (includin g new symptoms) should be captured.  Any update on 
the diagnosis, the medication taken to treat the ARI and ARI intensity will be 
recorded. For each ARI the maximum intensity should be recorded.  
If any laboratory testing is performed locally for the identif ication of respiratory 
pathogens for the ARI, the date of the testing, method of test, specimen material 
type, the results and the references of commercial PCR diagnostic kit (if 
applicable) should be recorded in the eCRF.  
− Daily health questionnaires : The participant will be reminded to complete the 
daily health questionnaires  until Day 15 at the latest in case the ARI is still 
ongoing. The participant should also be reminded when to stop completing the 
questionnaires  and how the completed questionnaires sh ould be returned to the 
site (Note: this is not applicable for ARI episodes reported before Visit 2) . 
− HCRU  should also be recorded.  
− Recording of A Es, SAEs and other events of interest:  refer to Section 8.3.

12 July 2023  83 • If the ARI ended before the follow -up call, the ARI outcome should be recorded and 
the scheduled  surveillance contacts should resume for that participant.  
• ARI closure contact (Day 29): If the ARI eve nt was still ongoing at the first ARI 
follow -up contact, t he investigator/ site staff  will contact again the participant 
approximately 28  days after ARI onset to check on the resolution of the ARI episode. 
ARI follow -up information and ARI closure will be recorded and the scheduled 
surveillance contacts should resume for that participant.  
• Additional follow -up contact: For participants with complication(s) lasting beyond 
the ARI closure  contact, additional follow -up contacts will be done approximatel y 
every 2 weeks post ARI closure contact until the resolution of the 
ARI/ complication(s) or until study end.  
• If between the different ARI visit/contacts, the participant was seen by another 
healthcare provider (HCP) for the ARI, the investigator/site staff  should attempt to 
get maximum information on the ARI episode, diagnosis and results of any 
laboratory test done for identification of respiratory pathogens.  
• Re-starting scheduled  surveillance contacts after ARI end:  Once an ARI event 
has ended, the surveillance contacts should resume for that participant. The first 
surveillance contact should be planned : 
− within maximum 14 days after the last ARI follow -up contact if the last FU 
contact was done during the RSV seasons, or  
− within a maximum of 30 days i f it’s during the inter -season period . 
8.1.1.6.2.  Other routes to capture ARI episodes  
In some situations, the site staff  might be informed of an ARI that was not immediately 
reported by the participant. The s ite staff  could become aware of these ARI during a 
surveil lance contact , via the participant’s call (later than 24  hours after ARI onset) , via 
the participant’s caregiver  or via the LTCF staff or hospital staff , for example.  
If the participant was seen by another healthcare provider (HCP) for the ARI, the 
investi gator/site staff should attempt to get maximum information on the ARI episode, 
diagnosis and results of any laboratory test done for identification of respiratory 
pathogens.  
Note that if an ARI event meets the definition of AE or SAE it should also be repo rted as 
AE/SAE according to the specified follow -up periods described in Section 10.3.8 . If an 
ARI is a suspected , probable  or confirmed COVID -19 case  as per WHO case definitions  
[WHO , 2020] , the COVID -19 specific eCRF page should be completed.  
a. If, at the time of notification, the ARI is still ongoing and is reported within the 
interval allowed for ARI visit:  
− The site staff should encourage the participant to take a nasal self -swab* and to 
complete the daily health  questionnaires ***. The site staff will organize an ARI 
visit within the per  protocol window **. Refer to Section 8.1.1.6.3  for guidance

8.1.2.  Immunogenicity assessments   
The immunogenicity of the vaccine will be evaluated by assessing the humoral immune 
response at different timepoints.  
Serological assays for the characterization  of the humoral immune response include 
ELISA for measurement of IgG antibodies binding to the RSVPreF3 protein and 
neutralization assay for determination of functional antibodies against RSV A  and 
RSV  B. RSVPreF3 IgG -binding ELISA and neutralization testi ng for RSV A  and RSV  B 
will be performed for participants included in the reactogenicity and immunogenicity 
subset. To evaluate the correlation between humoral  immune  response and protection, 
RSVPreF3 IgG -binding ELISA will also be tested on participants w ith RSV -confirmed 
disease and in a subset of control participants. A correlate  of protection might also be 
investigated by testing  the same subset by other relevant assays  such as neutralization 
assay (s) and system s serology . 
Additional assessments, includ ing but not limited to ELISA or other relevant assays for 
hMPV serological testing,  may be conducted.

CONFIDENTIAL  
212494 (RSV OA=ADJ -006) 
Protocol Amendment 5 Final  
12 July 2023  98 The investigator or designee will record and immediately report all SAEs to the sponsor 
or designee via the Expedited AE Reporting Form. This reporting should, under no 
circumstances, occur later than 24 hou rs after the investigator becomes aware of an SAE, 
as indicated in Section 10.3.10 . The investigator will submit any updated SAE data to the 
sponsor within 24  hours of it being available.  
A post -study AE/SAE is defined as any event that occurs outside of the AE/SAE 
reporting periods defined in  Table  23 . Investigators are not obligated to actively seek 
AEs or SAEs in former study participants. However, if the investigator lea rns of any 
SAE, including a death, at any time after a participant has been discharged from the 
study, and he/she considers the event to be reasonably related to the study vaccine, the 
investigator will promptly notify the Study Contact for Reporting SAEs mentioned in  
Table 25. 
8.3.2.  Method of detecting AEs and SAEs and other events  
Methods of detecting and recording AE/SAE/ AESI  (including pIMD s and AF)  are 
detailed in Section  10.3.8 . The assessment of AE/SAE intensity, causality and outcome 
are provided  in the Section 10.3.9 . 
Open -ended and non -leading verbal questioning of the participants is the preferred 
method of acquiring information related to an AE/ SAE/ AESI ( including pIMD s and AF) . 
8.3.3.  Regulatory r eporting requirements for SAEs  and other events   
Once an investigator (or designee) becomes aware that a study participant has 
experienced a n SAE/ AESI  (including pIMD s and AF) , he/she must report it to GSK 
using the required documentation, and within the timeframes, mentioned in  Table 24. 
This is essential for meeting legal obligations and ethical responsibilities f or participant 
safety and the safety o f a study intervention  under clinical investigation.  
For SAEs/ AESIs  (including pIMD s and AF) , the investigator will always provide an 
assessment of causality at the time of the initial report, as defined in Section  10.3.9.2 . 
Local regulatory requirements and sponsor policy for the preparation of an investigator 
safety report for Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions (SUSAR) must be 
followed. These reports will be forwarded to investigators as necessary.  
The sponsor has a legal responsibility to notify local authorities and other regulatory 
agencies about the safety of a study intervention under clinical investigation. The sponsor 
will comply w ith country -specific regulatory requirements related to safety reporting to 
the regulatory authority, IRB/IEC, and investigators.  
Please refer to Section 10.3.10  for further details regarding the reporting of SAEs/ AESI s 
(including pIMD s and AF) .

The investigator (or designee) must provide the participant with a “participant card” 
containing information about the clinical study. The participant must be instructed to 
keep the participant card in his/her possession at all times throu ghout the study. In an 
emergency, this card serves to inform the responsible attending physician/caregiver that 
the participant is in a clinical study and that relevant information may be obtained by 
contacting the investigator.  
8.4. Frailty status assessment  
To characterize the study population and determine if frailty may influence the safety , 
efficacy  or immune response following administration of the study vaccine, the 
participants’ frailty status will be assessed at study entry (refer to Section 10.5.2  for the 
definition of frailty) . Data should be recorded in the eCRF . 
The frailty status will be determined using the Gait speed test  (refer to the SPM for 
details ).

12 July 2023  101 8.10.1.  Completion of HR -QoL questionnaires  
The EQ -5D and  SF-12 questionnaires will be distributed and explained by the 
investigator or site staff and will be completed by all participants in the presence of site 
staff at Visit 1 (Day 1), Visit 3 (pre -Season 2) and Visit 5NH  (pre-Season 3) and at the 
ARI visit f or participants with ARI. Completeness of these questionnaires will be 
checked by the site staff in presence of the participant.  
In addition, the daily paper health questionnaires will be distributed to all participants at 
Visit 2 (Day 31 post -Dose 1), Vis it 3 (pre -Season 2) and Visit 5NH (pre -Season 3).  
The daily health questionnaires include:  
• The Influenza patient -reported outcome  (FLU -PRO) questionnaire , 
• The Patient Global Impression of Severity  (PGI -S), 
• The Patient Global Impression of Change  (PGI -C). 
The 3 questionnaire s will be explained by the investigator or site staff and a first copy  
will be completed by all participants in the presence of site staff  at Visit 2 as a baseline 
measurement . For each  ARI episode , participants will be required to complete a copy of 
the health  questionnaire s at home daily starting from the day  after the ARI onset until 
resolution of the episode or for a maximum of 14  days.  (Note: completion of the daily 
health questionnaires  is not a pplicable for ARI episodes reported before Visit 2) . 
Note:  
• In case of physical incapacity that would preclude the self -completion of the  
questionnaires, either site staff can assist the participant (for questionnaires 
completed during site visits) or the participant  may designate a caregiver for 
transcribing responses to the questionnaire. However, at no time, the caregiver /site 
staff will evaluate the participant ’s health status, answer questionnaires or make 
decisions on behalf of the participant . Refer t o Section 10.5.2  for definition of 
caregiver.  
• In case the questionnaire was completed with the assistance of a caregiver /site staff , 
this should be recorded on the questionnaire.  
Please refer to the SPM for  more information on the questionnaires, including data 
collection.  
8.10.2.  HCRU 
For all participants reporting an ARI episode, scheduled and unscheduled healthcare use 
linked to the ARI will be recorded in the eCRF. This will include:  
• Number of physician visits  (General practitioner or specialist) , 
• Emergency department visits,  
• Intensive care unit admissions,

9. STATISTICAL CONSIDER ATIONS  
9.1. Statistical hypotheses  
9.1.1.  Primary objective  
The primary objective of VE of  a single dose of the RSVPreF3 OA investigational 
vaccine in the prevention of RSV -confirmed LRTD during the first season in adults ≥ 60 
years will be evaluated using a 1 -sided test at alpha=2.5% level : 
• Criterion : VE will be demonstrated if the LL of the 2 -sided 95% CIs is above 20%.  
VE Analysis 1 : 
The final analysis of the primary objective will be case -driven . It will be performed when 
at least 56 cases of RSV -confirmed LRTDs have been  accrued in the primary cohort for 
efficacy.  
This analysis will also include data from participants enrolled in SH  available at that 
time. 
If the number of cases triggering VE Analysis 1 ( at least 56 cases) is not achieved at the 
end of Season 1 in NH, an optional  interim analysis might  be performed when  at least 
35 cases have been accrued  (at the end of Season 1 in NH  or later) . In that case, an 
adjustment of the Type  I error will be done in order to maintain the overall significance 
level at 2.5%. The Wan g-Tsiatis approach which is an alpha spending method giving 
boundaries between O’Brien -Fleming and Pocock boundaries will be used [ Wang , 1987] 
to determine the adjusted alpha levels for the interim (α1) and the final (α2) analyses . If 
the interim analysis is performed, then the final analysis will be performed when at least 
60 cases a re accrued in the primary cohort for efficacy  or when all data associated to the 
primary objective are available . 
Table 26 provides the 1 -sided adjusted alpha levels obtained using the Wang -Tsiatis 
method with Δ = 0.3, depending on the quantity  of information accumulated at the time 
of interim analysis ( using gsDesign package in R).

9.1.2.  Secondary objectives  (Amended , 12 July 2023)  
The confirmatory secondary objective s are the following:  
• To demonstrate the efficacy of a single dose of the RSVPreF3 OA investigational 
vaccine in the prevention of RSV -confirmed LRTD in adults ≥ 60 YOA over several 
seasons.  
Criterion: The LL of the 2 -sided CI for VE is above 20%.  
• To demonstrate the efficacy of a single dose of RSVPreF3 OA investigational 
vaccine followed by 1 annual revaccination  before Season 2  in the prevention of 
RSV -confirmed LRTD in adults ≥ 60 YOA over several seasons.  
Criterion: The LL of the 2 -sided CI for VE is above 20%.  
• To demonstrate the efficacy of a single dose and 1 annual revaccination  before 
Season 2  of RSVPreF3 OA investigational vaccine in the prevention of RSV -
confirmed LRTD for each RSV subtype (A and B) separately in adults ≥ 60 YOA 
over 3 seas ons. 
Criterion: The LL of the 2 -sided CI for VE is above 0%.  
VE Analysis 2 after Season 1 in NH : 
The confirmatory secondary objective assessing VE of a single dose of  the RSVPreF3 
OA vaccine in the prevention of RSV -confirmed LRTD in adults ≥  60 years after 
Season  1 in NH will be evaluated conditionally to the success of the primary objective 
(success indicated by the black arrows in Figure 4) using a 1 -sided test at alpha=2.5% 
level.  
VE Analysis 2 will be performed when participants in NH have been followed until the 
end of the first season in NH (30 April) , i.e., when all ARI with ons et visit and swabs 
collected until the end of the season (30  April) are adjudicated and RSV qRT -PCR results 
are available.  
CONFIDENTIAL

Protocol Amendment 5 Final  
12 July 2023  104 VE Analysis 2 will be performed if at least 1 additional RSV -confirmed ARI has been 
reported since VE Analysis 1 and if there are at least 2 -3 weeks between the data lock 
point dates of the 2 analyses.  
VE of a single dose  over 2 and 3 seasons:  
• The confirmatory secondary objective assessing VE of a single dose with RSVPreF3 
OA vaccine in the prevention of RSV -confirmed LRTD in adults ≥  60 years after 
Season 2 in NH (S1+S2NH) will be evaluated conditionally to the success of the 
previous objective evaluating VE after Season 1 in NH (see  Figure 4). A Bonferroni 
adjustment of alpha for multiplicity will be applied. Therefore, this analysis will be 
done using a 1 -sided test at alpha=1.25% level.  
• The confirmatory secondary objective asse ssing VE of a single dose with RSVPreF3 
OA vaccine in the prevention of RSV -confirmed LRTD in adults ≥  60 years after 
Season 3 in NH (S1+S2+S3NH) will be evaluated conditionally to the success of the 
single dose objective after Season 2 (see  Figure 4). This analysis will be done using a 
1-sided test at alpha=1.25% level.  
• The confirmatory secondary objective assessing VE of a single dose with RSVPreF3 
OA vaccine in the prevention of RSV -confirmed LRTD for each RSV subtype (A 
and B) separately  in adults ≥  60 years after Season 3 in NH (S1+S2+S3NH) will be 
evaluated conditionally to the success of the RSV objective of single dose after 
Season 3. This analysis will be done using a 1 -sided test at alpha=1.25% level.  
Analysis will be case -driven and will be performed if at least 61 cases are accrued 
for each subtype (RSV A and RSV B). The RSV A objective will be tested first, and 
if demonstrated, the RSV B objective will also be tested (see  Figure 4). 
VE of the 1 annual revaccination  given before Season 2  over 2 and 3 seasons:  
• The confirmatory secondary objective assessing VE of the annual revaccination  
given before Season 2  with RSVPreF3 OA vaccine in the prevention of RSV -
confirmed LRTD in adults ≥  60 years after Season 2 in NH (S1+A2NH) will be 
evaluated conditionally to the success of the previous objective evaluating VE after 
Season 1 i n NH (see  Figure 4). A Bonferroni adjustment of alpha for multiplicity 
will be applied. Therefore, this analysis will be done using a 1 -sided test at 
alpha=1.25% leve l. 
• The confirmatory secondary objective assessing VE of the annual revaccination  
given before Season 2  with RSVPreF3 OA vaccine in the prevention of RSV -
confirmed LRTD in adults ≥  60 years after Season 3 in NH (S1+A2+A3NH) will be 
evaluated conditionally t o the success of the annual revaccination objective after 
Season 2 (see Figure 4). This analysis will be done using a 1 -sided test at 
alpha=1.25% level.  
• The confirmat ory secondary objective assessing VE of the annual revaccination  
given before Season 2  with RSVPreF3 OA vaccine in the prevention of RSV -
confirmed LRTD for each RSV subtype (A and B) separately  in adults ≥  60 years 
after Season 3 in NH (S1+A2+A3NH) will be  evaluated conditionally to the success 
of the RSV objective of annual revaccination after Season 3 (see Figure 4).

adjusted alpha level α1 and the final analysis will be performed when at least 60 cases are 
accrued (or when all data associated to the primary objective are available) using a 1-
sided test at adjusted alpha level α2  (see Table 26). 
If an interim analysis is performed, the  adjusted alpha level s used for testing of the 
secondary confirmatory objectives will be evaluated by simulations and will be further 
described in the Statistical Analysis Plan ( SAP). 
9.2. Sample size determination  
The study will enroll up to  25 000 participant s, distributed as follows : 
• Between at least 16 000 and up to 23 000 participants in the NH, and  
• Between 1  500 and 2 000 participants in the SH.  
Approximately 1  800 participant s will be included in the reactogenicity and 
immunogenicity subset with 1  620 participant s in NH and 180 participant s in SH.  
The sections below describe the assumptions and methodology used for the sample size 
calculation.  
Withdrawals will not be replaced.  
9.2.1.  Primary objective: Vaccine efficacy  
The overall Type I error is equal to 2.5% (1 -sided alpha=0.025). The sample size has 
been calculated based on the number of cases needed to demonstrate a VE against 
RSV  confirmed LRTD during the first season in NH, with the criterion of a LL of the 
95% CIs >20%.  
Hypothesis to show VE can be written as follows:  
H0: VE  20% versus Ha: VE >20%  
CONFIDENTIAL  
212494 (RSV OA=ADJ -006) 
Protocol Amendment 5 Final  
12 July 2023  107 And can also be translated using proportions:  
H0 : p ≥ p0 = 0.4444 versus Ha  : p < p0  
Using a 1-sided exact binomial test (Pass 2019, Exact test for on e proportion, 1 -sided 
alpha=0.025), at least 56 cases of RSV -confirmed LRTDs  are needed in the primary 
cohort for efficacy to have at least 90% power to demonstrate a significant VE (LL of 
95% CI >  20%), assuming a true VE of 70% (p=0.2308).  
Therefore, a ssuming an attack rate of RSV -confirmed LRTD around 0.6% during the first 
season, and that approximately 10% of the vaccinated participants will be non -evaluable 
for the primary analysis of efficacy, a minimum of 16  000 participants has to be enrolled 
to reach the expected number of cases in NH.  
However, due to the potential impact of COVID -19 pandemic measures on the RSV 
circulation and the difficulty to estimate the attack rate for the first season of the study, 
the sample size could be increased up to 23 000 participants in NH to mitigate the risk of 
a lower attack rate, as shown in  Table 27. 
Table 27 Total sample size to be enrolled in the NH to ensure at least 90% 
power to demonstrate the primary objective depending on attack 
rate, assuming a non -evaluable rate of 10%

 0.45%  21 500 
 0.42%  23 000 
 0.4%  24 000 
If an interim analysis is performed, the power to demonstrate the primary objective with 
at least 35 cases at interim is at least 54% (see Table 26). For the final analysis, at least 
60 cases will be needed (at adjusted alpha level= α2 , see Table 26), to have at least 90% 
power to demonstrate the primary objective.  
9.2.2.  Secondary objectives  (Amended , 12 July 2023)  
Table 28 provides the expected total number of RSV LRTD cases and the power for each 
analysis assuming:  
• a minimum sample size of 16  000 participants in NH  and of 1500 participants in SH , 
• a maximum sample size of 23  000 participants in NH and of 2000 participants in SH,  
• a non -evaluable rate of 10% for the efficacy analysis , 
• a dropout rate of 20% between each season,  
• an attack rate  of 0.6% at each season for RSV -confirmed LRTDs , 
• a VE against RSV -confirmed LRTDs of 70% over 1 season after Dose 1  (Season  1) 
and after 1 revaccination dose  (Season 2) , VE of 65% at Season 3.

For the confirmatory secondary objective of VE against RSV -confirmed LRTD for each 
RSV subtype (A and B ) separately after 3 seasons in NH , the analysis will be case -driven 
and will be performed if the trigger is reached for both RSV A and RSV B separately. 
The trigger has been computed to have 90% power to demonstrate each objective 
sequentially:  
• For VE of a single dose: at least 61 cases are needed to have at least 90% power to 
demonstrate a significant VE (LL of 97.5% CI >0%);  
• For VE of annual revaccination: at least 49 cases are needed to have at least 90% 
power to demonstrate a significant VE (LL of 97.5 % CI >0%).

9.2.3.  Sample size re -assessment  
The number of RSV -confirmed LRTD cases for the primary objective will be monitored 
on an ongoing basis during Season 1. This wi ll be performed in a blinded way by 
counting the total number of cases reported overall in the pooled RSV and Placebo 
groups.  
If the total number of cases reported up to early April  is low compared to the trigger for 
analysis (at least 56 cases), a second cohort (new participants) might be enrolled before 
the next season in NH, in order to continue the accrual of the cases at the next season 
(Season 1 of second  cohort) and to increas e the number of cases needed to demonstrate 
the primary objective.  
At the time of evaluation, the following rule will be applied for the enrol lment of the 
second cohort:  
• If the total number of cases is greater than 50 cases or lower than 12 cases:  No 
enrollment of second cohort. The monitoring will continue and VE Analysis 1 will 
be performed as described in Section 9.1.1 . 
• If the total number of cases is included in [ 12, 50 cases]: Enrol lment of a second 
cohort. In that case, new participants in NH will be enrolled and vaccinated before 
the next season in NH. The monitoring will continue and VE Analysis 1 will be 
performed as described in Section 9.1.1 . 
The study will be extended and will end when participants of the second cohort have 
been followed up to 3 consecutive RSV seasons.  
CONFIDENTIAL  
212494 (RSV OA=ADJ -006) 
Protocol Amendment 5 Final  
12 July 2023  110 According to feasi bility of enrol lment of this second cohort before the next season, it is 
estimated that a maximum number of 10  000 participants might be enrolled in the second 
cohort.  
GSK can decide to cancel this re -enrol lment if the final analysis (at least 56 cases) is 
performed at the end of Season 1 in NH or if the interim analysis is successful.  
The participants in this second cohort will be randomized in 3 study groups: RSV_annual 
group, RSV_1dose group and Placebo gr oup, according to a 1:1:2 randomization ratio, 
and they will follow the same study procedures as participants of the first cohort.  
The system’s randomization algorithm will use a minimization procedure accounting for 
center, age and region . Minimization fa ctors will have equal weight in the minimization 
algorithm.  
9.2.4.  Reactogenicity subset  
Solicited events  information will be collected for a subset of participants using paper 
diaries . Approximately 1800 participants will be included in the reactogenicity subset  
from  both NH and SH  (see Table 13). 
Table 31 presents the probability to observe at least one event, depending on the true AE 
rate, for 900 participants per group as well as for smaller subsets, as reactogenicity 
analysis might be done on several subgroups (e.g. , by age category, region). A subset of 
900 participants per group would provide a probability of 98.9% to observe at least one 
event with a true incidence rate of 0.5%.

Analysis set  Description  
Enrolled set  Participants who agreed to participate in a clinical study after completion of the 
informed consent process *. 
Exposed Set (ES)  All participants who received at least the first dose of the study intervention. The 
allocation in a group is done in function of the administered intervention.  
Per Protocol Set for 
immunogenicity (PPSi)  All participants who received at least the first dose  of the study intervention to which 
they were randomized, h ave post -vaccination immunogenicity data available, and did 
not meet protocol deviations that lead to exclusion.  
Solicited Safety Set  All participants who received at least the first dose of  the study intervention (E xposed 
Set) and have solicited safety d ata. 
*All participants enrolled and included in the database will be part of the enrolled set.  
Exposed Set Dose 2 and Exposed Set Dose 3 including all participants who received 
the 2nd and the 3rd dose, respectively , will also be used to report analysis on post -Dose 
2/3 data.  
In addition, the following populations will be defined for efficacy analyses  (refer to 
Section 9.4.3  for detailed information on the analysis set) : 
• Modified Exposed Set (mES) : the mES will be the primary population for efficacy 
analysis  on RSV -confirmed cases . It will include all participant s who received at 
least the first dose of the study intervention (ES) and who did not report a n RSV -
confirmed ARI prior to Day 15  after each vaccination. The allocation in a group is 
done in function of the administered intervention.  
mES will be defined by  dose as follows:  
• mES: participants who received Dose 1 and who did not report RSV ARI within 
15 days post -Dose 1,  
• mES Dose 2: participants who received Dose 2 and who did not report RSV ARI 
within 15 days post -Dose 2,  
• mES Dose 3: participants who received  Dose 3 and who did not report RSV ARI 
within 15 days post -Dose 3.  
Note that participants who received a third dose of RSVPreF3 OA investigational 
vaccine will not be included in the primary evaluation of annual revaccination 
over 3 seasons. Details will b e provided in the SAP.  
• Per Protocol set for efficacy (PPSe):  the PPSe will include all participants included 
in the mES who:  
− received at least the first dose of the study vaccine to which they were 
randomized,  
− did not have protocol deviations leading to ex clusion.  
The list of protocol deviations leading to exclusion from PPS will be defined in the SAP 
prior to study start.

outcomes (i.e., EQ -5D, SF -12 and daily health qu estionnaires ): 
• mES RSV -confirmed ARI cases:  All participants in the mES -RSV  who have an 
RT-PCR -confirmed RSV case . 
• mES RSV -confirmed LRTD cases:  All participants in the mES -RSV  who have an 
RT-PCR -confirmed RSV -LRTD case.  
9.3.1.  Criteria for elimination from analysis  
9.3.1.1.  Intercurrent medical conditions and concomitant 
medications/products/vaccines that may lead to elimination of a 
participant from per  protocol analyses  
If the participant meets one of the criteria mentioned in Section 5.2.1  (medical 
conditions) or Section 5.2.2  (concomitant therapy) , he/she may be eliminated from the 
PPSe and PPSi . 
In addition, participants may be eliminated from the PPSi if, during the study, they incur 
a condition that has the capa bility of altering their immune response (intercurrent medical 
condition) or are confirmed to have an alteration of their initial immune status.  
9.4. Statistical analyses  
The SAP will be finalized prior to First Participant First Visit and will include a more 
technical and detailed description of the statistical analyses described in this section. This 
section is a summary of the planned statistical analyses of the most important endpoints 
including primary and key secondary endpoints.  
For all statistical analys es described in this section, the 4 RSVPreF3 vaccine lots will be 
pooled and results will be presented for RSVPreF3 group, RSV_annual group or 
RSV_1dose group versus Placebo group.  
9.4.1.  General considerations  
9.4.1.1.  Demography  
For a given participant and a given demog raphic variable, missing measurements will not 
be replaced.  
9.4.1.2.  Efficacy  
All reported ARI cases will be reviewed by blinded, qualified GSK staff members to 
determine whether certain investigator -reported events meet the definition of efficacy 
endpoints (LRTD a nd severe LRTD), using pre -defined endpoint criteria. This review 
will be made on clinical criteria (signs/symptoms) and independently of the results of the 
RSV RT-PCR . 
CONFIDENTIAL  
212494 (RSV OA=ADJ -006) 
Protocol Amendment 5 Final  
12 July 2023  113 Detailed information on this adjudication process, including for data obtained by 
metho dologies which are not protocol -specified or for missing data, will be described in 
the adjudication charter.  
For a given participant and a given efficacy measurement, missing or non -evaluable 
measurements will not be imputed for the primary analysis. The missing endpoint and 
censoring are supposed to occur independently, and the pattern of the missingness being 
either Completely At Random (MCAR) or Missing At Random (MAR) only.  
The potential RSV or hMPV infections, including the potential infection to Aden ovirus, 
Enterovirus and Parainfluenza viruses, will be assessed by RT -PCR testing of swab 
samples (see Table 19). Swab samples that are positive for RSV and/or hMPV by  RT-
PCR will be tested by a multiplex PCR (panel of viruses) for detection of potential viral 
co-infection.  
A case that is positive by the quantitative RT -PCR for RSV A and/or RSV B will be 
counted as an RSV -confirmed case, whatever the result for RSVA/B t ested by multiplex 
RT-PCR, for hMPV or other respiratory virus tested by multiplex RT -PCR (co -infection).  
A case that is positive by multiplex RT -PCR for hMPV will be counted as a hMPV -
confirmed case, whatever the result for RSV A/B or other respiratory vi rus (co -infection).  
The events linked to primary and secondary efficacy outcomes will be identified and in 
case multiple events are observed for the same participant, only the first event will be 
considered for the primary analysis of all primary/secondary  endpoints.  
Therefore, for the primary analysis of the primary objective, the number of RSV -
confirmed LRTD will be computed on the first occurrence of qRT -PCR -confirmed RSV 
A and/or RSV B associated LRTD, starting on Day 15 after the first  vaccination for 
analysis on the mES -RSV  and the PPSe.  
For analysis on the ES, the analysis will include the first occurrence of the RSV -
confirmed LRTD case reported after the first  vaccination (starting from Visit 1).  
9.4.1.3.  Immunogenicity  
• Any missing or non -evaluable immunogeni city measurement will not be replaced. 
The descriptive analysis performed for each assay at each time point will exclude 
participants with a missing or non -evaluable measurement.  
• The geometric mean titers/concentrations (GMTs/GMCs) will be computed by 
taking the anti -logarithm of the arithmetic mean of the log 10 transformed 
titers/concentrations.  
• A seronegative participant will be defined as a participant whose antibody 
titer/concentration is below the cut -off value of the assay. A seropositive participant 
is a participant whose antibody titer/concentration is greater than or equal to the cut -
off value of the assay.  
CONFIDENTIAL  
212494 (RSV OA=ADJ -006) 
Protocol Amendment 5 Final  
12 July 2023  114 • Antibody titers/concentrations below the assay cut -off will be given an arbitrary 
value of half the assay cut -off for the purpose of GMT/GMC cal culation. Antibody 
titers/concentrations above the upper limit of quantification (ULOQ) of the assay 
will be given an arbitrary value of the ULOQ for the purpose of GMT/GMC 
calculation.  
• The mean geometric increase (MGI) is defined as the geometric mean of the within 
participant ratios of the post -vaccination titer/concentration over the pre -vaccination 
titer/concentration.  
9.4.1.4.  Reactogenicity/Safety   
• For a given participant and the analysis of solicited events within 4 days post -
vaccination, missing or non -evalu able measurements will not be replaced. Therefore, 
the analysis of solicited events will include only vaccinated participants with 
documented solicited safety data (i.e., paper diary completed).  
• For analysis of unsolicited AEs, SAEs, AESIs (including pIMDs  and AF)  and 
concomitant medications, all vaccinated participants will be considered. Participants 
who did not report an event or concomitant medication will be considered as 
participants without the event or the concomitant medication respectively.  
9.4.1.5.  Qualit y of life  
• The FLU -PRO version 2.0 is a 32 -item daily diary assessing influenza signs and 
symptoms across 6 body systems: Nose (4 items), Throat (3 items), Eyes (3 items), 
Chest/Respiratory (7 items, i.e., LRTI), Gastrointestinal (4 items), and 
Body/Systemi c (11 items). Respondents are asked to rate each sign or symptom on a 
5-point ordinal scale, with higher scores indicating a more frequent sign or symptom. 
For 27 of the items, the scale is as follows: 0 (“Not at all”), 1 (“A little bit”), 
2 (“Somewhat”), 3 (“Quite a bit”), and 4 (“Very much”). For 2 items, severity is 
assessed in terms of numerical frequency, i.e., vomiting or diarrhea (0 times, 1 time, 
2 times, 3 times, or 4 or more times); with the final 3 items; frequency of sneezing, 
coughing, and coug hed up mucus or phlegm evaluated on a scale from 0 (“Never”) 
to 4 (“Always”). The FLU -PRO total score is computed as the mean score across all 
32 items comprising the instrument. Total scores can range from 0 (symptom free) to 
4 (very severe symptoms).  
In addition, a score assessing the symptoms associated with upper respiratory 
systems will be computed as the mean score across the 10 items that make up the 
Nose, Throat and Eyes domains.  
Six individual domain scores will also be computed, representing sympt om severity 
in each of the assessed body areas: Nose, Throat, Eyes, Chest/Respiratory (i.e., 
LRTD), Gastrointestinal and Body/Systemic. Each domain score is calculated as the 
mean of all items comprising that domain, with scores ranging from 0 to 4.  
• The PG I-S and the PGI -C are 2 patient -reported questions on the severity of 
symptoms and the change in symptoms, respectively. The PGI -S classifies the 
severity of symptoms into 5 categories (No symptoms, Mild, Moderate, Severe, 
CONFIDENTIAL  
212494 (RSV OA=ADJ -006) 
Protocol Amendment 5 Final  
12 July 2023  115 Very  severe). The PGI -C classifie s the change in symptoms from the previous day 
into 7 categories (Much better, Somewhat better, A little better, About the same, 
A little worse, Somewhat worse and Much worse).  
• The EQ -5D health utility questionnaire, described through 5 dimensions scores ( i.e., 
mobility, self -care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression) will be 
converted into generate health profiles, i.e., a respondent who responds 1 (no 
problem/no symptom) to all 5 items has a profile “11111” and similarly a participant  
who responds with the highest level of difficulty or symptom to all items has a 
profile “33333”. These profiles are subsequently converted to a continuous single 
index utility score using a 1 to 1 matching.  
• The SF -12 questionnaire is a multi -purpose healt h survey with 12 questions. The SF -
12 covers 8  HR-QoL domains (physical functioning, role physical, bodily pain, 
general health, vitality, social functioning, role emotional and mental health). From 
these domains, summary scores for the physical component and mental component 
are computed. Scale scores will be constructed following the summated ratings and 
standardized SF -12 scoring algorithms.  
9.4.2.  Demographics and participants disposition  
Demographic characteristics (age at first vaccination in years, BMI, sex , race, ethnicity, 
geographical hemisphere location (Northern/Southern), type of residence (CD/LTCF), 
vital signs, comorbidities, frailty status and smoking status) will be summarized by group 
using descriptive statistics:  
• Frequency tables will be generate d for categorical variables such as race;  
• Mean, median, standard deviation and range will be provided for continuous data as 
age. 
The number of doses of the study vaccine administered will be tabulated by group.  
The distribution of participants will be tabulated as a whole and per group, for each age 
category, for each country and for each subset.  
The following age categories will be considered in the analysis: ≥65 years, ≥70 years, 
≥80 years, 60 -69 years, 70 -79 years.  
Withdrawal status will be summarized by group using descriptive statistics:  
• The number of participants enrolled into the study as well as the number of 
participants excluded from PP analyses will be tabulated.  
• The numbers of withdrawn participants will be tabulated according to the  reason for 
withdrawal.  
Participant disposition in the ES, mES and PPS (PPSi and PPSe) will be reported as a 
whole and per group, and for each age category.

12 July 2023  116 9.4.3.  Primary endpoint  
The primary efficacy analysis will be performed on the mES -RSV. In addition, a sec ond 
analysis will be performed on the PPSe and on the ES  to complement the primary 
analysis.  
The primary analysis of VE in terms of occurrence of RSV -confirmed LRTD will be 
evaluated using the conditional exact binomial method based on the Poisson model 
[Chan , 1998]. This method computes an exact CI around the rate ratio (ratio of the event 
rates in the vaccine versus control groups). The analysis will consider t he exact inference 
on the relative risk, adjusted by age categories and regions, conditionally to the total 
number of cases observed and time at risk. VE is defined as 1 minus the relative risk.  
For the primary analysis on the mES -RSV and the analysis on t he PPSe, the time at risk 
will correspond to the period starting on Day 15 after the first  vaccination up to the first 
occurrence of event or up to censoring.  
For the analysis on the ES, the full period after the first vaccination up to the first 
occurrenc e of event or censoring will be considered for the time at risk.  
During the surveillance period, all events related to the efficacy endpoints will be 
collected (see Section 8.1.1 ), but only the first event of RSV -confirmed LRTD will be 
considered for the primary analysis of efficacy endpoints.  
For a given participant, the first occurrence of LRTD will be considered as a confirmed 
RSV  positive  case for primary efficacy analysis if : 
• At least 1 sample is tested positive for RSV A and/or RSV B by GSK qRT -PCR, or  
• At least 1 sample is tested positive for RSV A and/or B by an external PCR test 
(non-GSK), if a GSK qRT -PCR result is not available.  
A sensitivity analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint will be performed considering the 
RSV cases confirmed by the GSK qRT -PCR only, i.e. , excluding the ones identified by 
an external laboratory.  
A second sensitivity analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint will be p erformed 
excluding RSV cases with respiratory co -infections (e.g. , hMPV, SARS -CoV -2, FLU, 
etc.).  
The methodology will be detailed in the SAP.  
9.4.4.  Secondary endpoints  
9.4.4.1.  Efficacy (Amended, 12 July 2023)  
The primary analysis of secondary efficacy endpoints will be performed on the mES  (see 
details in Section 9.3). In addition, for secondary confirmatory objectives, a second 
analysis will be performed on the PP Se and on the ES  to complement the primary 
analysis.  
CONFIDENTIAL  
212494 (RSV OA=ADJ -006) 
Protocol Amendment 5 Final  
12 July 2023  117 The ES will be the primary population for secondary efficacy endpoints not related to 
RSV.  
The same methodology as described for the primary endpoint (see Section  9.4.3 ) will be 
used to analyze the secondary efficacy endpoints described below. For the analysis over 
2 or 3 seasons, the model will include season as covariate, in addition to age category and 
region. The first occurrence of the event meeting the case definition according to the 
endpoint will be considered for the primary analysis of those secondary efficacy 
endpoints.  
Analysis of secondary efficacy endpoints will be performed at each VE analysis when 
applicable (see Section  9.5.1 ). 
The following endpoints will be evaluated following a single dose of the RSVPreF3 OA 
investigational vaccine and following 1 annual revaccination dose  given before Season 2 . 
Note that participants who received a third d ose of RSV PreF3 OA investigational  
vaccine will not be included in the primary evaluation of annual revaccination over 3 
seasons. Secondary analysis of the annual revacc ination on participants who received 
3 doses of RSV PreF3 OA  investigational  vaccine might be performed depending on the 
number of participants who will receive the Dose 3.  Details will be provided in the SAP.  
Confirmatory objectives  
• VE against RSV -confirme d LRTD over 3 seasons: VE will be evaluated at the end of 
Season 1 in NH, over 2  seasons at the end of Season 2 in NH and over 3  seasons at 
the end of Season 3 in NH.  
• VE against RSV -confirmed LRTD by RSV subtype over 3 seasons: on RSV A and 
RSV B qRT -PCR -confirmed cases separately. This will be evaluated after the end of 
Season 3 in NH.  
Other secondary objectives

PCR -confirmed cases separately.  
• VE against hMPV -confirmed LRTD, up to the end  of Season 1.  
• VE against RSV -confirmed LRTD  by age category: on participants ≥65 YOA, 
≥70 YOA and ≥80 YOA at the time of first vaccination.  
VE will also be computed for participants in 60 -69 YOA and 70 -79 YOA.  
• VE against RSV -confirmed LRTD by season:  
− VE du ring Season 1 in NH and SH, including first occurrence of cases reported 
during Season 1 from Day 15 after the first vaccination;  
− VE during Season 2 in NH and SH, including first occurrence of cases reported 
during Season 2 and excluding from the analysis participants who already 
reported an RSV -confirmed LRTD before the start of Season 2;  
CONFIDENTIAL  
212494 (RSV OA=ADJ -006) 
Protocol Amendment 5 Final  
12 July 2023  118 − VE during Season 3 in NH and SH (partial Season 3 in SH), including first 
occurrence of cases reported during Season 3 and excluding from the analysis 
participants who al ready reported an RSV -confirmed LRTD  before the start of 
Season 3.  
The time at risk for the analysis by season will be the period from the start of the 
corresponding season until the event, until the end of the season or until the last 
contact date for dro p-out participants.  
• VE against RSV -confirmed LRTD by year:  
− VE during the first year post -vaccination (Year 1) in NH and SH, including first 
occurrence of cases reported from Day 15 post -Dose 1 up to Dose 2 
administration;  
− VE during the second year post-vaccination (Year 2) in NH and SH, including 
first occurrence of cases reported from Day 15 post -Dose 2 up to 12 months 
post-Dose 2  in NH and SH, or up to Dose 3 administration in NH ; 
− VE during the third year post -vaccination (Year 3) in NH and SH, in cluding first 
occurrence of cases reported from 12 months  post-Dose 2 in NH up to study 
end. 
• VE against RSV -confirmed LRTD by baseline comorbidities: using the Charlson 
Comorbidity Index and according to comorbidities of interest:  
− COPD,  
− Asthma,  
− Any chronic  respiratory/pulmonary disease,

respiratory diseases,  
− Hospitalization due to RSV -confirmed respiratory diseases and due to 
complication related to RSV -confirmed respiratory diseases,  
CONFIDENTIAL  
212494 (RSV OA=ADJ -006) 
Protocol Amendment 5 Final  
12 July 2023  119 − Complications related to RSV -confirmed ARI,  
− Complications related to any ARI.  
• VE over time: The evolution of VE of a single dose of the RSVPreF3 OA vaccine 
against RSV -confirmed LRTDs over time will be explored using the Cox 
proportional hazard regression model. The model assumes that the ratio between 2 
hazards (vaccine versus placebo) does not depend on time.  This assumption will be 
checked by a test based on the Schoenfeld residuals. In addition, the VE analysis will 
be performed by splitting participants in 2 groups according to the  time of 
vaccination . 
For all RSV -confirmed ARI and LRTD cases, descriptive statistics will also be computed 
to summarize the number of episodes reported, the duration of the RSV episodes, the 
occurrence of each reported symptoms and signs, including the n eed for oxygen 
supplementation, and the occurrence of cases according to severity (see Section 8.1.1.6.1  
for severity assessment).  
9.4.4.2.  Immunogenicity  
The primary analysis of immunogenicity will be performed on the PPSi for participants 
included in the immunogenicity and reactogenicity subset.  
If in any study group the percentage of vaccinated participants with serological results 
excluded from the PPSi is more than 5%, a second analysis based on the ES for 
participants in the reactogenicity and immunogenicity subset will be performed to 
complem ent the PPSi analysis.  
An immunogenicity analysis based on ES will include all vaccinated participants 
included in the reactogenicity and immunogenicity subset for whom immunogenicity data 
are available.  
For each group, each immunological assay and at each  time point that blood samples are 
collected, the following analysis will be tabulated:  
• Percentage of participants with antibody titers/concentrations above pre -defined 
assay cut -offs and their 95% CIs;  
• GMT/GMCs and their 95% CIs;  
• Distribution of antibody titers/concentrations using reverse cumulative curves;  
• MGI with 95% CI.  
9.4.4.3.  Safety   
Reactogenicity analysis will be performed on the Solicited Safety set, for participants 
included in the immunogenicity and reactogenicity subset.  
All other safety analyses will  be performed on all participants included in the ES.  
CONFIDENTIAL  
212494 (RSV OA=ADJ -006) 
Protocol Amendment 5 Final  
12 July 2023  120 Reactogenicity analyses will include the following summaries by group:  
• The number and percentage of participants with at least one administration site event 
(solicited and unsolicited), with at least on e systemic event (solicited and 
unsolicited) and with any AE (solicited and unsolicited) with an onset during the 4 
day or 30 -day follow -up period after vaccination will be tabulated with exact 95% CI 
after each dose. The same computations will be done for  Grade 3 AEs, for Grade  3 
non-serious AEs and for AEs resulting in a medically attended visit.  
Those analyses will present all solicited and unsolicited AEs, including SAEs (unless 
otherwise specified) and will be performed on the ES.  
• The number and percen tage of participants reporting each individual solicited 
administration site or systemic event (any grade, Grade 3 and resulting in medically 
attended visit) with an onset during the 4 -day follow -up period after vaccination will 
be tabulated with exact 95%  CI after each dose.  
• For fever, the number and percentage of participants reporting fever by half degree 
(°C) cumulative increments and fever resulting in medically attended visit with an 
onset during the 4 -day follow -up period after vaccination will be ta bulated after each 
dose. In addition, the prevalence of any and Grade 3 fever will be presented 
graphically over time after each dose.  
• The number of days with solicited events reported with an onset during the 4 -day 
follow -up period will be tabulated after  each dose for each individual solicited event 
using descriptive statistics (mean, min, Q1, median, Q3, maximum).  
Safety analyses will include the following summaries by group on the ES:  
• The number and percentage of participants with any unsolicited AEs wi th an onset 
during the 30 -day follow -up period with its exact 95% CI will be tabulated after each 
dose by group and by MedDRA Primary System Organ Class (SOC), High Level 
Term (HLT)  and Preferred Term (PT) . Similar tabulation will be done for Grade 3 
unsol icited AEs, for any causally related unsolicited AEs, for Grade 3 causally 
related unsolicited AEs and for unsolicited AEs resulting in a medically attended 
visit.  
The analyses of unsolicited AEs will include SAEs (unless otherwise specified).  
• The verbatim  reports of unsolicited AEs, including SAE, will be reviewed by a 
qualified person and the signs and symptoms will be coded according to the 
MedDRA Dictionary for Adverse Reaction Terminology. Every verbatim term will 
be matched with the appropriate Prefer red Term.  
• The number and percentage of participants with at least one report of SAE classified 
by MedDRA Primary SOC, HLT and PT and reported from vaccination up to

12 July 2023  122 9.4.4.4.  Quality of life  
All analysis of patient -reported outcomes (i.e., EQ -5D, SF -12 and the daily health 
questionnaires) for RSV -confirmed cases will be carried out on the mES RSV -confirmed  
ARI cohort or  mES RSV -confirmed LRTD cohort, as appropriate . Data will be analyzed 
using descriptive statistics for the multi -item SF -12, EQ -5D and FLU -PRO  scales for 
each study group at each time point.  
Descriptive statistics of the EQ -5D, SF -12 and FLU -PRO scales completed pre -Seasons 1 
and 2 will be presented for the mES.  
For each confirmed case of RSV, the maximum score for FLU -PRO scale scores (e.g. , 
Chest and upper respiratory) during the first RT -PCR-confirmed RSV episode during the 
first 7 days from the onset of ARI symptoms will be calculated. The maximum FLU -PRO 
scores (e.g. , Chest and upper respiratory) during the first 7 days from the onset of ARI 
symptoms will be compared between study groups u sing a Wilcoxon non -parametric test.  
Estimated Least Squares mean FLU -PRO total score during the first 7 days from the 
onset of RSV -ARI episode for participants with RT -PCR -confirmed RSV, will be 
analyzed using a repeated measures analysis of variance (ANO VA) model. The model 
will be fitted including terms for age category, region and study group by time 
interaction. The least squares mean (LSMEANS) estimates for time by study group and 
the difference in least squares means and associated P -values will be o btained from the 
ANOVA model. The PROC MIXED procedure in SAS will be used to carry out the 
ANOVA, with all terms fitted as fixed effects.  
The study group difference in LSMEANS of the SF -12 physical functioning scores and 
EQ-5D utility score at the initial  ARI visit will be estimated using repeated measures 
mixed effects model including the timepoints: pre -season, initial ARI visit, and pre -next-
season visit. The model will include age categories and region as fixed effects.  
The endpoints will be evaluated following a single dose of the RSVPreF3 OA 
investigational vaccine and following the annual revaccination dose.  
9.4.5.  Tertiary/exploratory endpoints  
9.4.5.1.  Efficacy (Amended, 12 July 2023)  
The same methodology as described for the primary and secondary endpoints (see 
Sections 9.4.3  and 9.4.4.1 , respectively) will be used to analyze the te rtiary endpoints. 
The following endpoints will be evaluated following a single dose of the RSVPreF3 OA 
investigational vaccine and following the annual revaccination given before Season 2 : 
• VE against RSV and/or hMPV -confirmed LRTDs,  
• VE against hMPV -confirmed LRTDs up to the end of Season 2 and Season 3,  
• VE against severe hMPV -confirmed LRTDs according to the case definition 1 and 
case definition 2,  
CONFIDENTIAL  
212494 (RSV OA=ADJ -006) 
Protocol Amendment 5 Final  
12 July 2023  123 • VE against hMPV -confirmed ARI,  
• VE against RSV -confirmed ARI by subtype, by age category and by sea son, 
• VE against RSV -confirmed ARIs by baseline comorbidities: using the Charlson 
index and according to comorbidities of interest (as listed in Section  9.4.4.1 ), 
• VE in the prevention of any death (all -cause mortality) during the RSV seasons.  
The evolution of VE of a single dose of RSVPreF3 OA vaccine against RSV -confirmed 
ARI over time will be explored using the Cox proportional hazard regression model. The 
model as sumes that the ratio between 2 hazards (vaccine versus placebo) does not depend 
on time. This assumption will be checked by a test based on the Schoenfeld residuals. In 
addition, the VE analysis will be performed by splitting participants in 2 groups 
accor ding to the time of vaccination.  
The number and percentage of participants who reported more than 1 case of the 
following event will be tabulated by group, by season and also in consecutive seasons: 
any ARI, any LRTD, RSV -confirmed ARI, RSV -confirmed LRTD (according to the case 
definitions).  
The number and percentage of participants with other viral pathogens (detected by 
multiplex RT -PCR) co -existing with RSV or hMPV among RT -PCR -confirmed RSV or 
hMPV ARI episodes will be tabulated by group.  
9.4.5.2.  Analysis of HCRU  
Descriptive analysis of HCRU will be performed for participants with RSV -confirmed 
ARI or with any ARI and will be reported by group:  
• The n umber/percentage of participants who were hospitalized during the ARI 
episode or complication related to ARI,  
• The number/percentage of participants who received antibiotics for the treatment of 
ARI or complication related to ARI.  
For any other count variables that will be reported (e.g. , any medication or any medical 
visit), the number and percentage of events/parti cipants will be presented by group.  
9.4.5.3.  Quality of life  
The maximum PGI -S score during the first 7  days from the onset of ARI symptoms for 
the first RT -PCR -confirmed RSV LRTD episode will be calculated. The maximum PGI -
S score during the first 7 days from the onset of ARI symptoms will be compared 
between study groups using a Wilcoxon non -parametric test.

9.4.5.4.1.  Correlate of protection  (Amended , 12 July 2023)  
An exploratory analysis will be implemented in attempt to correlate the humoral immune 
response  to the RSVPreF3 OA investigational vaccine with protection against RSV -
confirmed disease.  
For that purpose, blood samples for humoral immune response will be collected from all 
participants at pre -Dose 1 (Day 1) , 1-month post -Dose 1 (Day 31) and at Visit 5NH*  and 
may be tested for correlate of protection analysis in all participants with RSV -confirmed 
disease and in a subset of control participants.  
There are 2 main strategies to define a subset of control: case -cohort and nested case 
control. For the same  number of participants, both methods provide similar results. 
However, the case -cohort strategy has the advantage to be more flexible in terms of data 
exploration and modelling [ Borgan , 2000].  
Statistical analysis will be done in several steps:  
1. Identification of Correlate of Risk: identify immunological response that correlates 
with the endpoint used to measure VE.  
2. Validation of Correlate of Protection, whic h is a correlate of risk that is validated to 
predict a certain level of protection from the targeted endpoint.  
3. Evaluation of a cut -off for protection: identify a “protective threshold” or humoral 
immune response level that distinguishes protected and unpr otected individuals.  
Further details on the methodology to assess the correlate of protection will be given in a 
separate SAP.  
* The blood sample at Visit 5NH is applicable after approval  of the current  Protocol 
Amendment 5.  
9.4.5.4.2.  Within groups analysis  
The immu nogenicity analysis will also be performed by age category (≥  65 YOA, 
≥ 70 YOA, ≥ 80 YOA, 60 -69 YOA, 70 -79 YOA), by hemisphere (NH and SH), by 
region and by baseline frailty status.  
9.4.5.5.  Safety  
The reactogenicity and safety analysis will also be performed by age category ≥  65 YOA, 
≥ 70 YOA, ≥  80 YOA, 60 -69 YOA, 70 -79 YOA), by hemisphere (NH and SH) and by 
region.  
The analysis of reactogenicity (solicited administration site and systemic events) will also 
be performed by baseline frailty status.

12 July 2023  125 9.5. Interim analyse s 
The optional interim analysis is described in the below sequence of analyses.  
9.5.1.  Sequence of analyses (Amended, 12 July 2023 ) 
This section is presenting the timing for each analysis. More information on the statistical 
link between the confirmatory objectives can be found in Section 9.1 (Figure 4). 
Analyses to evaluate objectives and endpoints will be performed in several steps:  
1. VE Analysis 1 – Season 1 (Primary Objective):  
The final analy sis of the primary objective will be case -driven. It will be performed when 
at least 56 cases of RSV -confirmed LRTDs have been accrued in the primary cohort for 
efficacy.  
An optional interim analysis might be performed if the number of cases triggering VE 
Analysis 1 (at least 56 cases) is not achieved at the end of Season 1 in NH. This interim 
analysis will be performed if at least 35 cases have been accrued (at the end of Season 1 
in NH or later). In that case, an adjustment of the Type  I error will be don e in order to 
maintain the overall significance level at 2.5%. The Wang -Tsiatis approach which is an 
alpha spending method giving boundaries between O’Brien -Fleming and Pocock 
boundaries will be used [ Wang , 1987] to determine the adjusted alpha levels for the 
interim (α1) and the final (α2) analyses . The final analysis will be performed when at 
least 60 cases are accrued or when all data associated to the primary objective are 
available.  
All data related to efficacy, safety and immunogenicity objectives available at that time 
will also be analyzed.  
2. VE Analysis 2 – End of Season 1 in NH:  
A second VE analysis will be performed when participants in NH have been follow ed 
until the end of the first season in NH (30 April).  
All analysis generated at VE Analysis 1 will be performed at VE Analysis 2 in order to 
have an end of Season 1 analysis, if at least 1 additional RSV -confirmed ARI has been 
reported since VE Analysis 1  and if there are at least 2 -3 weeks between the database cut-
off dates of the 2 analyses.  
If data related to endpoints not available at VE Analysis 1 become available at end of 
Season 1, the analysis might be performed at VE Analysis 2.  
All data related t o efficacy and immunogenicity objectives available at that time will also 
be analyzed.  
3. Safety analysis:  
An analysis of safety will be performed when all safety data up to 6  months post -Dose 1 
will be available for all participants in NH and SH.  
CONFIDENTIAL  
212494 (RSV OA=ADJ -006) 
Protocol Amendment 5 Final  
12 July 2023  126 4. VE Analysis  3: end of Season 2  in NH  
A fourth analysis will be performed to evaluate the efficacy, safety and  immunogenicity 
objectives over 2 seasons, when all participants in NH have been followed until the end 
of second season (S2) in NH . 
All the analyses described above  will be performed on data as complete and as clean as 
possible, by an unblinded IES. The unblinded analyses will be shared with an unblinded 
committee independent from the project (firewall). Access to individual intervention 
codes and labo ratory data will be restricted to the IES in charge of the analyses.  
The firewall will review the unblinded summaries to prevent the potential risk of 
unblinding at participant level. If the summary results may lead to the unblinding of some 
specific parti cipants (e.g., in case an event occurred only in 1 group), the blinding of 
results will be managed by the IES. In this situation, exact results per group will not be 
provided to the study team. Only blinded data will be released to the blinded study team 
members and investigators. Further details of this approach can be found in the firewall 
charter. The firewall team will no longer be active as of the implementation of Protocol 
Amendment 4 as of which point study statisticians will perform the analyses and  manage 
the blinding of results for blinded study team members and investigators.  
No individual data listings with the participant numbers information will be disseminated 
to the investigators at this point of time.  
5. VE Analysis 4: end of Season 2 in NH and  SH 
An analysis will be performed to evaluate the efficacy, safety and immunogenicity 
objectives over 2 seasons, when all participants in NH and SH have been followed until 
the end of second season (S2) in SH.  
6. VE Analysis 5: end of Season 3 in NH  
An analysis will be performed to evaluate the efficacy, safety and immunogenicity 
objectives over 3 seasons, when all participants in NH have been followed until the end 
of third season (S3) in NH.  
7. VE Analysis  6: End of Study analysis  
This analysis will be pe rformed at the end of the study, i.e., when all participants (except 
drop-outs) will have completed the last study visit: end of Season 3 (S3) in NH (Visit 
7NH) and end of study in SH (Visit 5SH).  
Individual data listings will only be generated at this sta ge. 
9.6. Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) (Amended)  
Unblinded evaluation of safety data will be performed by an IDMC on a regular basis. In 
preparation of the IDMC meetings, unblinded analyses will be performed by an IES to 
maintain the study blind.  Only the outcomes and recommendations of the IDMC will be 
communicated to the study team. Operational details will be provided in the IDMC 
Charter.

12 July 2023  127 A firewall team will be set up in order to allow the planned analyses to be performed and 
results shared wi th the IDMC, while the study blind is maintained to the whole team and 
participants. All details of this approach can be found in the firewall charter.  As of 
implementation of the Protocol Amendment 4, the firewall team will no longer be active.

10.2.1.  Laboratory assays for immune response  
RSV A /B neutralization assay  
The serum neutralization assay is a functional assay that measures the ability of serum 
antibodies to neut ralize RSV entry and replication in a host cell line.  
Virus neutralization is performed by incubating a fixed amount of RSV A strain (Long, 
ATCC No. VR -26) or RSV -B strain (18537, ATCC No. VR -1580) with serial dilutions of 
the test serum. The serum -virus m ixture is then transferred onto a layer of Vero cells 
(African Green Monkey, kidney, Cercopitheus aethiops, ATCC CCL 81) and incubated 
for 2 days to allow infection of the Vero cells by non -neutralized virus and the formation 
of plaques in the cell layer. Following a fixation step, RSV -infected cells are detected 
using a primary antibody directed against RSV (Polyclonal anti -RSV A /B IgG) and a 
secondary antibody conjugated to horse radish  peroxidase (HRP), allowing the 
visualization of plaques after colorati on with TrueBlue  peroxidase substrate. Viral 
plaques are counted using an automated microscope coupled to an image analyzer 
(Scanlab system with a Reading software). For each serum dilution, a ratio, expressed as 
a percentage, is calculated between the number of plaques a t each serum dilution and the 
number of plaques in the virus control wells (no serum added). The serum neutralizing 
titer is expressed in ED60 (Estimated Dilution 60) and corresponds to the inverse of the 
interpolated serum dilution that yields a 60% reduc tion in the number of plaques 
compared to the virus control wells, as described by others [ Barbas , 1992; Bates , 2014]. 
The ED60  neutralizing t iters will also be converted in concentration in International Units 
per milliliter (IU/mL). Secondary standard calibrated against the international reference 
(NIBSC 16/ 284) will be included in the runs.  
RSVPreF3 protein IgG ELISA  
Responses to the RSVPreF3 antigen will be evaluated by an indirect ELISA allowing the 
detection and the quantification of RSVPreF3  IgG binding antibodies in human serum 
samples.  
The principle of  these assays is as follows: RSVPreF3 protein antigen will be adsorbed 
onto a 96 -well polystyrene microplate. After washing and blocking steps, dilutions of 
serum samples, controls and standards will be added to the coated microplate. A 
reference standard curve will be prepared using a pool of commerci al human serum 
containing anti -RSV antibodies. After incubation, the microplate will be washed to 
remove unbound primary antibodies. Bound IgG will be detected by the addition of a 
secondary anti -human antibod y (total IgG -specific), conjugated to HRP. Bound 
antibodies are quantified by the addition of the HRP substrate, tetramethylbenzidine 
(TMB) and hydrogen peroxide, whereby a colored product develops proportionally to the 
amount of anti -RSVPreF3 protein tota l IgG antibodies present in the serum sample. The 
optical density of each sample dilution is then interpolated on the reference standard. The 
corresponding antibody concentration, corrected for the dilution factor, is expressed in 
arbitrary ELISA Laborator y Units per milliliter (ELU/mL).

and/or hMPV -related immune responses.  
10.2.2.  Laboratory assays for molecular biology  
Quantitative RT-PCR able to discriminate RSV  A and RSV  B subtypes  
Briefly, RSV A and RSV B RNAs extracted from the nasal/throat swabs are detected in a 
duplex RT-PCR format using specific amplification primers and fluorescent probes 
designed in the RSV N gene, encoding the RSV nucleocapsid protein. The process 
involves nucleic acids extraction, conversion of RNA to complementary 
deoxyribonucleic acid by reverse transcription and detection by real -time PCR reaction 
using a calibration curve (absolute quantitation). The RSV viral load is reported as copies 
of RSV R NA per mL of sample.  
Qualitative multiplex RT-PCR for detection of a panel of viruses including hMPV  
A qualitative multiplex RT-PCR assay is used for the detection and identification of 
multiple respiratory virus nucleic acids in the nasal/throat swabs. Th e following virus 
types and subtypes can be identified in the assay:  
• Human adenovirus (AdV)  
• Human metapneumovirus (hMPV)  
• Human enterovirus (HEV)  
• Human parainfluenza virus including at least types 1, 2, 3 and 4 (PIV1, PIV2, PIV3 
and PIV4) . 
Qualitative multiplex RT-PCR for detection of additional respiratory viruses  
A qualitative multiplex RT-PCR assay is used for the detection and identification of 
multiple respiratory virus nucleic acids in the nasal/throat swabs. The following virus 
types and subtypes can be identified in the assay:  
• Influenza A virus (Flu A)  
• Influenza B virus (Flu B)  
• Human respiratory syncytial virus A (RSV A)  
• Human respiratory syncytial virus B (RSV B)  
• Human Influenza A virus subtype H1 (Flu A -H1) 
• Human Influenza A virus s ubtype H3 (Flu A -H3) 
• Human Influenza A virus subtype H1pdm09 (Flu A -H1pdm09)  
• Human bocavirus ½/3/4 (HBoV)  
• Human rhinovirus A/B/C  
• Human coronavirus including at least 229E, NL63, OC43 and SARS -CoV-2 species

sample.  
10.3.  Appendix 3: Adverse Events: definitions  and procedures for 
recording, evaluating, follow -up, and reporting  
10.3.1.  Definition of an Adverse Event (AE)  
• An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical study participant, 
temporally associated with the use of study intervention, whether o r not considered 
related to the study intervention.  
• NOTE: An AE can therefore be any unfavo rable  and unintended sign (including an 
abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally 
associated with the use of study interventi on. 
10.3.1.1.  Events meeting the AE definition  
• Significant or unexpected worsening or exacerbation of the condition/indication 
under study.  
• Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre -existing condition including either an 
increase in frequency and/or intensity of the condition.  
• New conditions detected or diagnosed after study vaccine administration even 
though they may have been present prior to the start of the study.  
• Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected interaction.  
• Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study 
vaccine or a concurrent medication (overdose per se should not be reported as an 
AE/SAE).  
• Signs or symptoms temporall y associated with study vaccine  administration.  
• Signs, symptoms that require medi cal attention (e.g. , hospital stays, physician 
visits and emergency room visits).  
• Pre- or post - intervention events that occur as a result of protocol -mandated 
procedures (i.e. , invasive procedures, modification of participant’s previous 
therapeutic regime n). 
• Clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings or other abnormal assessments 
that are present at baseline and significantly worsen following the start of the study 
will also be reported as AEs or SAEs.  
• AEs to be recorded as solicited events  are de scribed in the Section  10.3.3 . All 
other AEs will be recorded as UNSOLICITED AEs.  
CONFIDENTIAL  
212494 (RSV OA=ADJ -006) 
Protocol Amendment 5 Final  
12 July 2023  135 10.3.1.2.  Events NOT  meeting the AE definition  
• Situations where an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (e.g. , social and/or 
convenience admission to a hospital, admission for routine examination).  
• Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of pre -existing disease(s) or condition(s) 
present or detected at the start of the study that do not worsen.  
• Pre-existing conditions  or signs and/or symptoms present in a participant prior to 
the first study vaccination . These events will be recorded in the medical history 
Section of the eCRF.  
• Hospitali zation for elective treatment of a pre -existing condition (known or 
diagnosed prior to informed consent signature) that did not worsen from baseline.  
• Clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings or other abnormal assessments 
that are associated with the disease being studied, unless judged by the investigator 
as more severe than ex pected for the participant’s condition, or that are present or 
detected at the start of the study and do not worsen.  
10.3.2.  Definition of a Serious Adverse Event ( SAE) 
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that:  
a. Results in death . 
b. Is life -threatening  
Note: The term ‘life -threatening’ in the definition of ‘serious’ refers to an event in 
which the participant was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer 
to an event, which hypothetically might have caused death, had it been more 
severe.  
c. Requires hospitali zation or prolongation of existing hospitali zation  
Note: In general, hospitali zation signifies that the participant has been admitted at 
the hospital or emergency ward for observation and/or treatment that would not 
have been appropriate in the physician’s office or in an out -patient setting. 
Complications that occur during hospitali zation are also considered as AEs. If a 
complication prolongs hospitali zation or fulfil ls any other serious criteria, the 
event will also be considered serious. W hen in doubt as to whether 
‘hospitali zation’ occurred, or was necessary, the AE should be considered serious.  
d. Results in disability/incapacity  
Note: The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to 
conduct normal life functions.  This definition is not intended to include 
experiences of relatively minor medical significance such as uncomplicated 
headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrh ea, influenza -like illness, and accidental trauma 
(e.g., sprained ankle) which may interfere or prevent  everyday life functions but 
do not constitute a substantial disruption.  
e. Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect in the o ffspring of a study participant.  
CONFIDENTIAL  
212494 (RSV OA=ADJ -006) 
Protocol Amendment 5 Final  
12 July 2023  136 f. Other situations  
Medical or scientific judg ment  should be exercised in deciding whether reporting 
is appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be 
immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospitali zation but may 
jeopardi ze the participant or may require medical or surgical intervention to 
prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the above definition. These should also 
be considered serious. Examples of such events are invasive or malignant cancers, 
intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home fo r allergic bronchospasm, 
blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitali zation.  
10.3.3.  Solicited events  
a. Solicited administration  site events  
The following administration site events will be solicited  from participants in the 
reactogenicity and im munogenicity subset : 
Table 33 Solicited administration site  events  
Pain  
Erythema  
Swelling  
b. Solicited systemic  events  
The following systemic events  will be solicited  from participants in the reactogenicity 
and immunogenicity subset : 
Table 34 Solicited systemic events  
Fever  
Headache  
Fatigue  
Myalgia  
Arthralgia  
Note: Participants  will be instructed to measure and record the oral , axillary or tympanic  
body temperature in the evening. Should additional temperature measurements be 
performed at other times of day, participants  will be instructed to record the highest 
temperature in the paper diary card . 
10.3.4.  Unsolicited  adverse events  
An unsolicited AE is an adverse event that was not solicited and that was spontaneously 
communicated by a participant  who has signed the informed consent. Unsolicited AEs 
include serious and non -serious AEs.  
Potential unsolicited AEs may be medically attended (i.e., sympto ms or illnesses 
requiring a hospitali zation, or emergency room visit, or visit to/by a health care provider). 
The participants will be instructed to contact the site as soon as possible to report 
CONFIDENTIAL  
212494 (RSV OA=ADJ -006) 
Protocol Amendment 5 Final  
12 July 2023  137 medically attended event(s), as well as any events that, tho ugh not medically attended, 
are of participant concern. Detailed information about reported unsolicited AEs will be 
collected by qualified site personnel and documented in the participant’s records.  
Unsolicited AEs that are not medically attended nor perce ived as a concern by participant 
will be collected during interview with the participants  and by review of available 
medical records at the next visit.  
10.3.5.  Adverse events of special interest (AESIs)   
Adverse events of special  interest (AESIs)  collected during this study include potential 
immune -mediated diseases (pIMDs ) and AF. 
10.3.5.1.  Potential immune -mediated diseases   
pIMDs are a subset of AESIs that include autoimmune diseases and other inflammatory 
and/or neurologic disorders of interest which may or may not have an autoimmune 
etiology . AEs that need to be recorded and reported as pIMDs include those listed in 
Table 35 (refer to Section 10.3.8.1  for reporting details).  
However, the investigator will exercise his/her medical and scientific judg ment  to 
determine whether other diseases have an autoimmune origin (i.e. , pathophysiology 
involving systemic or organ -specific pathogenic autoantibodies) and should also be 
recorded as a pIM D.

to be less likely.  
For each case of AF reported in the AE or SAE section in the eCRF, additional 
information will be collected in a specific ‘AF follow -up questionnaire’ eCR F screen.  
10.3.6.  Clinical laboratory parameters and other abnormal assessments 
qualifying as AEs or SAEs  
In the absence of a diagnosis, abnormal laboratory findings (e.g. , clinical chemistry, 
hematology , urinalysis) or other abnormal assessments the investigator considers 
clinically significant will be recorded as an AE or SAE if they meet the definition of an 
AE or SAE (refer to the Sections 10.3 and 10.3.2 ). 
The investigator will exercise his or her medical and scientific judg ment  in deciding 
whether an abnormal laboratory finding or other abnormal assessment is clinically 
significant.

Not applicable  for the study population . 
10.3.8.  Recording and follow -up of AEs, SAEs , AESIs  (including pIMD s 
and AF) (Amended, 12 July 2023 ) 
The participants will be instructed to contact the investigator immediately should the 
participants manifest any signs or symptoms they perceive as serious.  
When an AE/SAE /AESI  (including pIMDs and AF)  occur s, it is the responsibility of the 
investigator to review all documentation (e.g. , hospital progress notes, laboratory and 
diagnostics reports) relative to the event. The investigator will then record all relevant 
information regarding an AE/SAE /AESI (including pIMDs and AF)  in the eCRF. The 
investigator is not allowed to send photocopies of the participant’s medical records to 
GSK instead of appropriately completing the eCRF. However, there may be instances 
when copies of medical records for certain c ases are requested by GSK. In this instance, 
all participant identifiers will be blinded on the copies of the medical records prior to 
submission to GSK.  
The investigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis pertaining to the event based on 
signs, symptom s, and/or other clinical information. In such cases, the diagnosis should be 
documented as the AE/SAE /AESI  (including pIMDs and AF)  and not the individual 
signs/symptoms.  
A paper diary  will be used in this study to capture solicited administration site or 
systemic events in participants in the reactogenicity and immunogenicity subset and 
unsolicited AEs  in all participants . The participant should be trained on how and when to

complete the paper diary him/herself, he/she may be helped by a caregiver (refer to 
Section 10.5.2  for the definition of caregiver).  
Any individual(s) who performs the measurements of administration site or systemic 
events and who will enter the information into the paper diary , e.g. the study caregiver , 
should have received a  caregiver  information letter  explaining the role of the care giver 
prior to completing the diary card . If any other individual  than the participant  is making 
entries in the paper diary , their identity should be documented in the participant’s source 
record . 
• Collect and verify completed diary cards during discussion with the participant on 
Visit 2 (Day 31 post -Dose 1) , Visit 4 (Day 31 post -Dose 2)  and Visit 6NH (Day  31 
post-Dose3) *. 
• Any unreturned diary cards will be sought from the participant  through telephone 
call(s) or any other convenient procedure.  
• The investigator or delegate will transcribe the required information into the eCRF in 
English.  
* Not applicable for participants in the NH who will have their Visit 5NH after the 
approval  of the current Protocol Amendment 5 and will not receive any study 
intervention at pre -Season 3 visit (Visit 5NH).  
Refer to the SPM for more information regarding the use of the paper diary . 
10.3.8.1.  Time period for col lecting and recording AEs, SAEs , AESIs  (including 
pIMD s and AF)   
Refer to Table 23 in Section 8.3.1  for an overview of the protocol -required reporting 
perio ds for AEs, SAEs  and pIMDs.  AF reporting will follow the same reporting periods 
as for AEs and SAEs . 
All solicited events with an onset during the 4-day period following each study vaccine 
administration in participants enrolled in the reactogenicity and immunogenicity subset 
must be recorded into the paper diary, irrespective of intensity.  
All unsolicited AEs with an onset during the 30-day period fol lowing each study vaccine 
administration in all participants must be recorded into the paper diary, irrespective of 
intensity or whether or not they are considered vaccination -related. All other AEs 
occurring within this time frame should be recorded into the appropriate section of the 
eCRF, irrespective of intensity or whether or not they are considered vaccination -related.  
Non-serious AF with an onset during the 30-day period following each study vaccine 
administration will be collected.  
SAEs , serious AF and pIMDs will be collected and recorded from the day of vaccination 
up to 6  months post -vaccination for each dose.

Protocol Amendment 5 Final  
12 July 2023  144 All SAEs and pIMDs considered vaccination -related, any fatal SAEs and AEs/SAEs 
leading to withdrawal from the study will be collected and re corded from the time of 
receipt of first study vaccine until the participant is discharged from the study . In 
addition, SAEs related to study participation or to a concurrent GSK medication/vaccine 
will be collected from the time of consent obtained until the participant is discharged 
from the study.  
10.3.8.2.  Follow -up of AEs, SAEs , AESIs  (including pIMD s and AF)   
After the initial report of an AE/SAE/ pIMD  or any other event of interest for the study, 
the investigator is required to proactively follow each participant at subsequent 
visits/contacts. All SAEs , AESIs  (including pIMDs  and AF)  (as defined in Section 
10.3.5 ), will be followed until the event is resolved, stabili zed, otherwise explained, or 
the participant is lost to follow -up. 
Refer to Section 10.3.10  for timeframes and further inform ation on how to report SAEs, 
pIMDs and other events.  
10.3.8.2.1.  Follow -up during the study   
AEs (serious or non -serious) , AESIs  (including pIMDs and AF) documented  at a 
previous visit/contact and defined as not recovered/not resolved or recovering/resolving 
will be reviewed at subsequent visits/contacts until the end of the study or the participant 
is lost to follow -up. 
If participant dies during participation in the  study or during a recogni zed follow -up 
period, GSK will be provided with any available post -mortem findings, including 
histopathology.  
10.3.8.2.2.  Follow -up after the participant is discharged from the study   
The investigator will provide any new or updated relevant information on previously 
reported SAE /pIMD  to GSK using a paper/electronic Expedited Adverse Events Report , 
as applicable . For AF cases, the investigator will provide any new or updated relevant 
information on previously reported AF to GSK using a paper/e lectronic Expedited 
Adverse Events Report and the AF follow -up questionnaire as applicable.  
The investigator is obliged to perform or arrange for the conduct of supplemental clinical 
examinations/tests and/or evaluations to elucidate the nature and/or causality of the AE or 
SAE as fully as possible.  
10.3.8.3.  Updating of SAE , AESI  (including pIMD  and AF) information after 
removal of write access to the participant’s eCRF   
When additional SAE , AESI  (including pIMD  and AF)  information is received after 
removal of w rite access to the participant’s eCRF, new or updated information should be 
recorded on the appropriate paper report, with all changes signed and dated by the 
investigator. The updated report should be faxed to the Study Contact for Reporting 
SAEs (refer t o the Section 8.3.4  or to GSK Clinical Safety and Pharmacovigilance 
department within the defined reporting time frames specified in  the Table 24.

10.3.9.1.  Assessment of intensity  
The intensity of the following solicited events  will be assessed as described:  
Table 36 Intensity scales for solicited event s in ad ults 
Event  Intensity grade  Parameter  
Pain at the injection site  0 None  
 1 Mild: Any pain neither interfering with nor preventing 
normal every  day activities  
 2 Moderate: Painful when limb is moved and interferes with 
every  day activities  
 3 Severe: Significant pain at rest. Prevents normal every  
day activities  
Erythema  at the injection site Record greatest surface diameter in mm  
Swelling at the injection site  Record greatest surface diameter in mm  
Temperature*   Record temperature in °C/°F  
Headache  0 Normal  
 1 Mild: Headache that is easily tolerated  
 2 Moderate: Headache that interferes with normal activity  
 3 Severe: Headache that prevents normal activity  
Fatigue  0 Normal  
 1 Mild: Fatigue that is easily tolerated  
 2 Moderate: Fatigue that interferes with normal activity  
 3 Severe: Fatigue that prevents normal activity  
Myalgia  0 Normal  
 1 Mild: Myalgia that is easily tolerated  
 2 Moderate: Myalgia that interferes with normal activity  
 3 Severe: Myalgia that prevents normal activity  
Arthralgia  0 Normal  
 1 Mild: Arthralgia that is easily tolerated  
 2 Moderate: Arthralgia that interferes with normal activity  
 3 Severe: Arthralgia that prevents normal activity  
* Fever is defined as a temperature ≥ 38.0°C/100.4°F by any route.  The route for measuring temperature can be oral, 
axillary or tympanic . 
The maximum intensity of local injection site erythema/swelling and fever will be scored 
at GSK as follows:  
Intensity grade  Erythema/Swelling  Fever  
0  20 mm  < 38.0°C (100.4°F)  
1 > 20 -  50 mm  ≥ 38.0°C (100.4°F) -  38.5°C (101.3°F)  
2 > 50 -  100 mm  > 38.5°C (101.3°F) -  39.0°C (102.2°F)  
3 > 100 mm  > 39.0°C (102.2°F)  
The investigator will assess the maximum intensity that occurred over the duration of the 
event for all unsolicited AEs (including SAEs) recorded during the study. The assessment 
will be based on the investigator’s clinical judg ment . 
CONFIDENTIAL  
212494 (RSV OA=ADJ -006) 
Protocol Amendment 5 Final  
12 July 2023  146 The intensity should be assigned to 1 of the following categories:  
1 (mild)  = An AE which is easily tolerated by the participant, causing 
minimal discomfort and not interfering with everyday activities.  
2 (moderate)  = An AE which is sufficiently discomforting to interfere with 
normal everyday activities.  
3 (severe)  = An AE which prevents normal, everyday activities  
(In adults, such an AE w ould, for example, prevent attendance at 
work and would necessitate the administration of corrective 
therapy.)  
An AE that is assessed as Grade 3 (severe) should not be confused with an SAE. Grade 3 
is a category used for rating the intensity of an event; and both AEs and SAEs can be 
assessed as Grade 3. An event is defined as ‘serious’ when it meets 1 of the pre -defined 
outcomes as described in the Section  10.3.2 . 
10.3.9.2.  Assessment of causality  
The investigator must assess the relationship between the study vaccine  and the 
occurrence of each unsolicited AE/SAE using clinical judg ment . Where several different 
vaccines/products were administered, the investigator should specify, when possible, if 
the unsolicited AE/SAE could be causally related to a specific vaccine/product (i.e. , 
investigational, control/placebo or co -administered vaccine). When causal relationship to 
a specific vaccine/product  cannot  be determined, the investigator should indicate the 
unsolicited AE/SAE to be related to all products.  
Alternative plausible causes, such as natural history of the underlying diseases, 
concomitant therapy, other risk factors, and the temporal relationship of the event to the 
study vaccine  will be considered and investigated. The investigator will also consult the 
IB to determine his/her assessment.  
Causality should be assessed by the investigator using the following question:  
Is there a reasonable possibility that the unsolicited AE may have been caused by the 
study vaccine?  
YES  : There is a reasonable possibility that the study vaccine  contributed to 
the AE.  
NO : There is no reasonable possibility that the AE is causally related to the 
administrat ion of the study vaccine. There are other, more likely causes , 
and administration of the study vaccine  is not suspected to have 
contributed to the AE.  
If an event meets the criteria to be determined as ‘serious’ (see Section  10.3.2 ), additional 
examinations/tests will be performed by the investigator to determine ALL possible 
contributing factors for each SAE.  
Possible contributing factors include:  
• Medical history.  
CONFIDENTIAL  
212494 (RSV OA=ADJ -006) 
Protocol Amendment 5 Final  
12 July 2023  147 • Other medication.  
• Protocol -required procedure.  
• Other procedure not required by the protocol.  
• Lack of efficacy of the vaccine, if applicable.  
• Erroneous administration.  
• Other cause (specify).  
There may be situations when an SAE has occurred , and the investigator has minimal 
information to include in the initial report to GSK. However, it is very important to 
record an assessment of causality for every event before submitting the Expedited 
Adverse Events Report to GSK.  
The causality assessment  is one of the criteria used when determining regulatory 
reporting requirements. The investigator may change his/her opinion of causality after 
receiving additional information and update the SAE information accordingly.  
10.3.9.3.  Medically attended visits  
For each solicited event and unsolicited AE the participant experiences, the participant  
will be asked if he/she received medical attention defined as hospitali zation, or an 
otherwise unscheduled visit to or from medical personnel for any reason, including  
emergency room visits. This information will be recorded in the eCRF.  
10.3.9.4.  Assessment of outcomes  
The investigator will assess the outcome of all unsolicited AEs (including SAEs) 
recorded during the study as:  
• Recovered/resolved.  
• Recovering/resolving.  
• Not recov ered/not resolved.  
• Recovered with sequelae/resolved with sequelae.  
• Fatal (SAEs only).  
10.3.10.  Reporting of SAEs , AESIs  (including pIMD s and AF)  
10.3.10.1.  Events requiring expedited reporting to GSK  
Once an investigator becomes aware that an SAE has occurred in a study part icipant, the 
investigator (or designee) must complete information in the electronic Expedited Adverse 
Events Report WITHIN 24 HOURS. The report will always be completed as thoroughly 
as possible with all available details of the event.  
CONFIDENTIAL  
212494 (RSV OA=ADJ -006) 
Protocol Amendment 5 Final  
12 July 2023  148 Even if the investig ator does not have all information regarding an SAE, the report 
should still be completed within 24 hours. Once additional relevant information is 
received, the report should be updated WITHIN 24 HOURS. The investigator will always 
provide an assessment of  causality at the time of the initial report.  
Refer to the Table 24 for the details on timeframes for reporting of SAEs/ AESIs  
(including  pIMD s and AF) . 
The investigator will be required to confirm the review of the SAE causality by ticking 
the ‘reviewed’ box in the electronic Expedited Adverse Events Report within 72 hours of 
submission of the SAE.  
Refer to the Section 10.3.10.2  for the back -up system in case the electronic reporting 
system does not work.  
10.3.10.2.  Back -up system in case facsimile or electronic reporting system does 
not work  
In rare circumstances if the electron ic reporting system does not work, the investigator 
(or designee) must fax completed, dated and signed paper Expedited Adverse Events 
Report to the Study Contact for Reporting SAEs (refer to the Sponsor Information ) or to 
GSK Clinical Safety and Pharmacovigilance department within 24 hours.  
Investigator (or designee) must complete the electronic Expedited Adverse Events Report 
within 24 hours u pon electronic reporting system is resumed. The information reported 
through the electronic SAE reporting system will be considered valid for regulatory 
reporting purposes.

trial if he or she has “participated as a subject in a clinical trial targeting healthy people 
within the last 6 months.”  
Therefore, in order to comply with this local requirement, investigators from Republic of 
Korea should carefully check, before enrolling each participant in the study, that they 
have not participated in any other clinical study targeting healthy people within the last 
6 months prior to enrollment/first study vaccination.  
10.4.3.2.  Safety monitoring   
In addition, the following points  should be noted  concerning  safety monitoring : 
• No safety “holding rules” or criteria for pausing or ear ly termination have been 
defined for this study.  
• An Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) has been put in place and will 
be in charge of reviewing unblinded safety data on an agreed schedule.  
• It will be at the IDMC discretion to recommend, if deemed  necessary, that the study 
recruitment is paused or terminated based on their unblinded data reviews.  
• In addition to the IDMC reviews, GSK’s SRT will perform regular  reviews of 
blinded data and may request  the IDMC to perform ad -hoc unblinded reviews if an y 
potential safety  concern is suspected based on blinded data.  As of the 
implementation of Protocol Amendment 4, SRT will review unblinded safety data.

10.5.2.  Glossary of terms   
 
Adverse event:  Any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical 
investigation participant, temporally associated with the use 
of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to 
the medicinal product.  
An adverse event (AE) can therefore be any unfavo rable  and 
unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), 
sympt om, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally 
associated with the use of a medicinal product. For marketed 
medicinal products, this also includes failure to produce 
expected benefits (i.e. , lack of efficacy), abuse or misuse.  
Adverse event of 
special interest:  An adverse event of special  interest (serious or non -serious) 
is one of scientific and medical concern specific to the 
sponsor’s product or program , for which ongoing monitoring 
and rapid communication by the investigator to the sponsor 
can be ap propriate. Such an event might warrant further 
investigation in order to characteri ze and understand it. 
Depending on the nature of the event, rapid communication 
by the trial sponsor to other parties (e.g., regulators) might 
also be warranted.  
Blinding:  A procedure in which one or more parties to the trial are 
kept unaware of the intervention assignment in order to 
reduce the risk of biased study outcomes. The level of 
blinding is maintained throughout the conduct of the trial, 
and only when the data are cleaned to an acceptable level of 
quality will appropriate personnel be unblinded or when 
required in case of a serious adverse event . 
In an observer -blind study, the participant, the site and 
sponsor personnel involved in the clinical evaluation of the 
participants are blinded while other study personnel may be 
aware of the intervention  assignment.  
Caregiver:  A ‘caregiver’ is a person w ho has a continuous caring role 
for a participant or may be a person having substantial 
periods of contact with a participant and/or is engaged in 
his/her daily health care (e.g. , a relative of the participant 
including family members or friends, a nurse o r LTCF staff

In the context of this study, a caregiver can be appointed by 
the participant to oversee and support the participant’s 
compliance with protocol -specific procedures (such as 
trans cribing responses to questionnaires and diaries, 
receiving phone calls, planning study visits, performing the 
nasal self -swab, etc.). However, at no time, the caregiver 
should evaluate the participant’s health status while 
answering diaries and/or question naires or make decisions 
on behalf of the participant.  
Certified copy:  A copy (irrespective of the type of media used) of the 
original record that has been verified (i.e. , by a dated 
signature or by generation through a validated process) to 
have the same information, including data that describe the 
context, content, and structure, as the original.  
Community Dwelling

considered as AESI in this study and additional 
information on these events is to be reported in the 
AF follow -up questionnaire in electronic case 
report form  (eCRF).  An imbalance in cases of AFs in 
the 30 -days post Dose 1 was 
observed. These safety data 
were reviewed by the SRT and 
the IDMC, and no safety signals 
were identified. However, GSK is 
of the opinion that a detailed 
assessment of all AF cases is 
required.

12 July 2023  176 Section 2.1. Study rationale  
GSK  is developing  an investigational vaccine  has developed a new RSVPreF3 OA  
vaccine against RSV -associated (subtypes A and B) disease in adults ≥ 60 YOA .  
The purpose of the current study is to demo nstrate the efficacy of the RSVPreF3 OA 
investigational vaccine in the prevention of RT -PCR -confirmed LRTD caused by RSV A 
and/or B in adults ≥ 60 YOA, following a single dose of the RSVPreF3 OA vaccine and 
following annual revaccination doses . The vaccine  cross -protection against RT -PCR -
confirmed LRTD caused by human metapneumovirus (hMPV) will also be evaluated.  In 
addition, the safety and immunogenicity of the vaccine will be assessed after each dose.  
Section 2.2. Background  
At the time of initiation of this study, There is currently  no vaccine or nor other 
prophylactic treatment was available against RSV or hMPV in older adults. Since then, 
GSK’s RSVPreF3 OA investigational vaccine was first approved for use in an adults ≥  
60 YOA in the US on 3 May 2023, followed by the European Union on 6 June 2023  
Currently available treatment for RSV and hMPV infections in this age group is generally 
supportive in nature.  
Section 2.3.2.  Benefit assessment  
At the start of this study, the eff icacy of the RSVPreF3 OA investigational vaccine was 
not demonstrated yet. Hence it was unknown if  tThe participants receiving the 
RSVPreF3 OA investigational vaccine may not directly  would  benefit from this 
vaccination because the vaccine efficacy (VE) has not been assessed yet . Since then, the  
efficacy of RSVPreF3 OA investigational vaccine was demonstrated and the study 
primary confirmatory objective was met.  One dose of RSVPreF3 OA vaccine has 
shown a favorable benefit/risk profile.  The vaccine was ap proved for use in an adults 
≥ 60 YOA in the US on 3 May 2023, followed by the European Union on 6 June 2023.  
The VE Analysis 3 data showed that revaccination administered approximately 12 
months after Dose 1 did not confer additional benefit in prevention of RSV -confirmed 
LRTD for the overall population of adults ≥ 60 YOA, while the second dose of vaccine 
has a clinically acceptable safety profile. The clinical development program will 
continue to evaluate longer term follow -up and the optimal timing for po tential 
revaccination.  Hence, it is not known whether the RSVPreF3 OA investigational vaccine 
is effective in protecting against RSV disease.  
An indirect benefit is that the information obtained in this study will aid the development 
of an RSV vaccine, whi ch is intended to prevent disease associated with RSV infection in 
older adults.

12 July 2023  184 Section 4.2. Scientific rationale for study design  
The study is designed as a Phase 3, observer -blind, placebo -controlled study enrolling 
adults ≥ ³ 60 YOA, who will be followed up for 3 consecutive RSV seasons in the NH 
and at least 2 consecutive RSV seasons in the SH.  
The results of VE Analysis 3 evaluating the efficacy and safety up to the end of Season 
2 in the NH , showed that 1 dose of the RSVPreF3 OA vaccine is efficacious against 
RSV -LRTD and severe LRTD at least over 2 RSV seasons, and that a second dose of 
the study vaccine administered before Season 2 did not confer additional benefit in 
prevention of RSV -confirmed LRTD. Safety and reactogenicity data post -Dose 2 were 
consistent with previous results from the Phase 3 program.  
Based on this observation , the study design was modified to remove the next annual 
revaccination dose of study vaccine (Dose 3 pre -Season 3) in the NH. The clinical 
development program will continue to evaluate longer term follow -up and the optimal 
timing for revaccination.  
Section 4.2.2.  Rationale for the use of placebo  
As there is was currently  no licensed RSV vaccine available at the time of  initiation of  
this study , a placebo group (receiving saline solution) is will be used as control for the 
efficacy, safety/reactogenicity and immunogenicity assessments.  
Section 6.1. Study interventions administered  
After completing all prerequisite procedures prior to vaccination, one dose of study 
vaccine will be prepared and adminis tered as shown in Table 10 for Dose 1 and Table 11 
for the annual revaccination doses . Refer to Section 4.1 for the schedule of vaccine 
administration.  
For the annual revaccination doses : 
The RSV_annual group will receive an additional dose of RSVPreF3 OA vaccine before 
each subsequent RSV season  while the RSV_1dose and Placebo groups will receive 1 
dose of placebo at the same timepoints *. Refer to Section 4.1 for details on the study 
design.  
* Participants in the NH who will have their Visit 5NH after  the approval  of the 
current Protocol Amendment 5, will not receive any study intervention at pre-Season 3

* The last study visit in SH (Visit 54 SH) will occur approximately 2 months after the start of Season 3 in SH; yet the 
site staff surveillance contacts will be performed monthly during these last months (i.e., continuation of the inter -
season frequency of contacts).  
Section 8.1.3.2.  Biological samples for immunogenicity assessment  
A blood s ample will be taken from all participants in both hemispheres at pre -Dose 1 
(Day 1) , and 1-month post -Dose 1 (Day 31) and from all participants at Visit 5NH*  to 
allow the evaluation of a potential correlate of protection.  In addition, the immune 
response t o the RSVPreF3 OA investigational vaccine will be further evaluated at other 
timepoints in a subset of participants (see Table 18).  
The overall volume of blood that will be collected during the entire study period is as 
follows:  
• ~60 mL (3 x 20 mL) for participants in the reactogenicity and immunogenicity 
subset from SH,  
• ~80 mL (4 x 20 mL) for participants in the reactogenicity and immunogenicity

12 July 2023  191 Section 9. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
9.1.2.  Secondary objectives  
• To demonstrate the efficacy of a single dose of RSVPreF3 OA investigational 
vaccine followed by 1 annual revaccination s before Season 2  in the prevention of 
RSV -confirmed LRTD in adults ≥ 60 YOA over several seasons.  
Criterion: The LL of the 2 -sided CI for VE is above 20%.  
• To demonstrate the efficacy of a single dose and 1 annual revaccination  before 
Season 2  doses  of RSVPreF3 OA investig ational vaccine in the prevention of RSV -
confirmed LRTD for each RSV subtype (A and B) separately in adults ≥ 60 YOA 
over 3 seasons.  
Criterion: The LL of the 2 -sided CI for VE is above 0%.  
VE of the 1 annual revaccination given before Season 2  over 2 and 3  seasons:  
• The confirmatory secondary objective assessing VE of the annual revaccination 
given before Season 2  with RSVPreF3 OA vaccine in the prevention of RSV -
confirmed LRTD in adults ≥  60 years after Season 2 in NH (S1+A2NH) will be 
evaluated conditional ly to the success of the previous objective evaluating VE after 
Season 1 in NH (see Figure 4). A Bonferroni adjustment of alpha for multiplicity 
will be applied. Therefore, this analysis will be done using a 1 -sided test at 
alpha=1.25% level.  
• The confirmat ory secondary objective assessing VE of an the annual revaccination 
given before Season 2  with RSVPreF3 OA vaccine in the prevention of RSV -
confirmed LRTD in adults ≥  60 years after Season 3 in NH (S1+A2+A3NH) will be 
evaluated conditionally to the success  of the annual revaccination objective after 
Season 2 (see Figure 4). This analysis will be done using a 1 -sided test at 
alpha=1.25% level.  
• The confirmatory secondary objective assessing VE of an the annual revaccination 
given before Season 2  with RSVPreF3  OA vaccine in the prevention of RSV -
confirmed LRTD for each RSV subtype (A and B) separately  in adults ≥  60 years 
after Season 3 in NH (S1+A2+A3NH) will be evaluated conditionally to the success 
of the RSV objective of annual revaccination after Season 3 (see Figure 4).  
Analysis will be case -driven and will be performed if at least 49 cases are accrued 
for each subtype (RSV A and RSV B). The RSV A objective will be tested first, and 
if demonstrated, the RSV B objective will also be tested (see Figure 4).  
Note that participants who received a third dose of RSVPreF3 OA investigational 
vaccine will not be included in the evaluation of annual revaccination over 3 seasons.

Study Design Overview  Synopsis  
Title  Open -label Extension  Study to Evaluate Longer -Duration Response to the NTX100 
Neuromodulation System for Patients with Medication -Refractory Primary Restless Legs 
Syndrome (RLS)   
Study Device NTX100 Neuromodulation System (“NTX100”), a n investigational device developed by 
Noctrix Health, Inc .  NTX100  is an external (non -implantable) neurostimulation device that is  
worn bilaterally on the lower legs .   
Subjects  are instructed to self- administer stimulation on each night that RLS symptoms  are 
present, as needed , to reduce and relieve RLS symptoms.   Multiple stimulation sessions may 
be applied with a maximum of 120min per night.  
Study Objective  To assess longer -duration  efficacy, tolerability, and adherence for  patients with moderate to 
severe medication -refractory RLS with the NTX100 Neuromodulation System  (NTX100) .   
Study Population  This study will enroll adults with primary moderate -severe medication -refractory RLS who 
previously completed  the RESTFUL Study  (Advarra IRB  Protocol # Pro00050412 ). 
Study Design  Arm 1  (Direct Roll -Over Extension)  – For subjects who successfully complete The RESTFUL 
Study at or after the  initiation of CT-05 at a given clinical site .  Arm 1 involves a 24 -wk extension 
period of NTX100 device use followed by a n 8-wk period without device use.  
Arm 2  (Control Group) – For subjects who  successfully  complete the RESTFUL  Study prior to  
the initiation of CT -05 at a given site or for subject s who choose  not to enroll  into Arm 1 . 
Subj ects enrolled in Arm 2  will not receive treatment with the NTX100  device. Arm  2 involves 
follow -up phone calls to access  RLS progression and medication usage at 8 -wks, 16 -wks, and 
24-wks from the last date of RESTFUL study  participation.  
Arm 3  (Delayed Extension) – For subjects who successfully complete the RESTFUL Study prior 
to the initiation of CT-05 at a given clinical site . Arm 3 involves a 24 -wk extension period of 
NTX100 device use followed by a n 8-wk period without device use.  The sponsor will notify 
each site once Arm 3 is open to enroll study subjects  for that site .

1. Background  
A clinical need has been identified of improved treatment for those suffering with primary idiopathic 
restless legs syndrome (RLS). Patients with RLS have a strong urge with sensations of tingling/pain, 
usually in their legs, and often present with a primary complaint of not being able to fall asleep regularly.  This leads to significant quality of life degradation, depression, daytime sleepiness, lack of 
productivity and a host of downstream effects associated with lack of quality sleep.  
1.1. Restless leg syndrome: Background  
Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a sensorimotor disorder that is characterized by a distressing urge to move the legs and in some cases, other parts of the body such as arms  [1].  The diagnosis is made by 
a response to five hallmark identifying criteria instituted by the Internat ional Restless Legs Syndrome 
Society (IRLSS) [2], as quoted below:  
“1. An urge to move the legs usually but not always accompanied by or felt to be caused by 
uncomfortable and unpleasant sensations in the legs.  
2. The urge to move the legs and any accompan ying unpleasant sensations begin or worsen during 
periods of rest or inactivity such as lying down or sitting.

3. The urge to move the legs and any accompanying unpleasant sensations are partially or totally relieved 
by movement, such as walking or stretch ing, at least as long as the activity continues.  
4. The urge to move the legs and any accompanying unpleasant sensations during rest or inactivity only 
occur or are worse in the evening or night than during the day.  
5. The occurrence of the above features  are not  solely accounted for  as symptoms primary to another 
medical or a behavioral condition (e.g., myalgia, venous stasis, leg edema, arthritis, leg cramps, positional 
discomfort, habitual foot tapping).”  
Diagnostically, RLS is considered either primary , often occurring within families, or secondary, 
developing in association with other conditions (such as iron deficiency anemia, pregnancy or end -
stage renal disease).  
1.2. Epidemiology  
In the United States, RLS is believed to affect more than 10 million adults and an estimated 1.5 million 
children and adolescents [3].  About one -third of those with RLS symptoms are bothered sufficiently 
enough to seek medical attention. Epidemiologic studies also show that women are at least 50% more susceptible to RLS than me n and RLS is more common in older adults, although it can occur in some 
as early as the pre -school years.  
1.3. Clinical treatments available  
The current standard of care involves initial prescription of dopaminergic medications –  such as 
Requip, Mirapex, and N eupro  – which initially provide symptomatic relief but often become 
ineffective over continued usage  [4].  Tolerance to these medications is rapid and well- documented  
[5]; approximately 10% of patients per year become refractory to these medications, and fewer than 
20% patients have sustained benefits lasting 10 years or longer [6]. It is also now understood that 
dopaminergic medications cause what is known as “augmentation ”, or paradoxical progressive 
worsening of RLS symptoms that is much faster than the natural progression of the condition.  Due to augmentation, patients on dopaminergic medications require increasingly higher doses [7]. Maximal 
dosage is limited by an inc reasing risk of side -effects at higher doses, which include compulsive 
behaviors including substance abuse, hypersexuality, and gambling [8] .  As a result of these downsides 
of dopaminergic agents, a minority of clinicians are starting to prescribe gabapen tinioids (e.g. 
Horizant) as an alternative first -line of treatment; these medications do not typically lead to

augmentation but confer risks such as respiratory depression [9],  dizziness, and somnolence during 
the day.  
For the large subpopulation of patien ts who become refractory to dopaminergic medications – 
typically due to augmentation –  there are no FDA approved treatment options and no safe treatment 
options.  As a result of tolerance, augmentation, and dosage limitations, RLS patients often continue 
to suffer from moderate -severe RLS symptoms while continuing to be reliant on high doses of 
dopaminergic medications to provide a small degree of relief.  To address the massive unmet need, 
the leading clinicians involved with RLS advocate prescribing off -label opioids  [10].  The leading 
options – oxycodone and methadone, have well documented risks, which include addiction, 
dependence, overdose, and occasionally death.  This situation is especially concerning because 
primary RLS typically starts in middle ag e or earlier and persists throughout life, thus patients may end 
up reliant on opioids for the final decades of their lives.   
 
1.4. Investigational  Procedure  
The investigational device  – the NTX 100 Neuromodulation System –  is a non -invasive nerve peripheral 
stimulation (NPNS) device developed by Noctrix Health, Inc . (Sponsor)  and designed to bilaterally 
stimulate the common peroneal nerve. Stimulation electrodes are positioned superficially and 
bilaterally on the lower legs over the head of the fibula bone, a position where the peroneal nerve is closest to the skin.  This nerve target innervates regions of the lower extremities commonly associated with RLS symptoms.  
1.5. Rationale  
The NTX 100 Neuromodulation System is a NPNS devic e that is inspired by the temporary symptomatic 
relief that RLS patients experience during voluntary movement of their lower extremities.  One of the fundamental diagnostic criteria for RLS is the fact that patients report short -lived symptomatic relief 
during voluntary movement of their legs and feet  [2].  This is conceptually similar to the gate -control 
theory mechanism of pain relief, wherein activation of large sensory fibers suppresses pain signals.  However, for RLS, it appears th at muscle activation is especially effective –  activating sensory fibers

of the affected region of the body (e.g. via rubbing or touching) does not typically result in similar 
relief.  
Non -invasive electrical stimulation is known to elicit muscle activatio n – this feature is used by two 
types of approved medical devices –  powered muscle stimulators (21 CFR 890.5850) and external 
functional neuromuscular stimulators (21 CFR 882.5810).  However, these devices tend to have 
distracting side -effects including pa resthesia and phasic muscle twitches, and thus are incompatible 
with sleep and inappropriate for use in treating a sleep condition such as RLS.  In contrast, the NPNS  
investigational device tested here produces waveforms that are designed  to generate muscl e 
activation without these paresthesia and phasic muscle twitches.  Therefore, this technology may be compatible with sleep.  
The NTX 100 Neuromodulation System stimulates the peroneal nerve at its most superficial position 
over  to the head of the fibula bon e to activate muscles of the lower leg including the tibialis anterior 
at intensity levels that are comfortable and non -distracting.  Such  comfortable tonic muscle activation 
is designed to suppress  RLS symptoms in a manner similar to  voluntary movement – but unlike 
voluntary movement, may be compatible with sleep .  Moreover, the output waveforms and intensities 
of the NTX100 Neuromodulation System are similar to Functional Electrical Neuromuscular 
Stimulators  and Transcutaneous Electr ic Nerve Stimulation (TENS) Devices for treatment of pain, two 
classes of devices designated nonsignificant risk per 21 CFR 812.3.  Therefore, there is a reasonable 
expectation that  the NTX 100 Neuromodulation System will lack significant risks.  
This study evaluates the effects of NPNS  on the symptoms of RLS  during in-home subject- administered 
stimulation.  This approach is useful for  evaluating  safety, usability, tolerability, and preliminary 
efficacy in a realistic environment -  thus identifying  any and all barriers to effective and tolerable use.  
1.6. The RESTFUL Study  
The Sponsor of this study previously received IRB approval for “ A Multi -Center, Randomized, Double -
Blind, Sham- Controlled Study to Evaluate the NTX100 Neuromodulation System for Patients with 
Medication -Refractory Primary Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) –  The RESTFUL study ” 
(Advarra IRB  Protocol  #Pro00050412), which has the objective of providing comparative evidence 
assessing clinically meaningful benefit in the treatment of patients with moderate to severe

medication -refractory RLS with the NTX100 Neuromodulation System.  The enrollment for “The 
RESTFUL study” began in May 2021, and is currently  enrolling subjects as of November 2021.  The 
current  study  is intended as an extension to the RESTFUL  Study and thus  is limited to subjects who 
previously completed the  RESTFUL Study .   
2. Regulatory Status  
The Sponsor  has determined that the investigational device in this study – the NTX100 
Neuromodulation System –  is a nonsignificant risk device under 21 CFR §812.2(b) .  In previously 
approved  investigational protocol s RLS-SNS01 and CT -03, Western IRB confirmed that earlier NTX100 
Neuromodulation System prototypes -  with comparable stimulation output -  were nonsignificant risk 
devices . The investigational protocol CT -04 uses the same NTX100 Neuromodulation System 
prototy pe planned for  use in this  study , which was also approved as  an nonsignificant risk d evice study 
by Advarra IRB on March 25, 2021. Therefore, an approved Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) 
from FDA is not required to legally perform the study described  herein in the US.   
The rationale for the nonsignificant risk  determination is that the NTX100 Neuromodulation System 
has equivalent risks and comparable electrical stimulation parameters to Transcutaneous Electric 
Nerve Stimulation (TENS) Devices for trea tment of pain (except for chest pain/angina),” which are 
Nonsignificant risk (NSR) device per the FDA guidance on Significant Risk and Nonsignificant Risk Medical Device Studies [ 11]. 
3. Objective  
The study objective is to assess longer -duration efficacy, tolerability, and adherence for patients with  
moderate  to severe medication -refractory RLS with the NTX100 Neuromodulation System (NTX100).   
4. Study Design  
Subjects who have previously completed The RESTFUL  Study are consented to o ne of three Arms, the 
design of which is illustrated in the flowchart below (Figure 1).  Arm 1 is a Direct Roll -Over Extension, 
Arm 2 is a Control, and Arm 3 is a Delayed Extension.   A subject may be asked to participate in Arm 3 
after completing Arm 2.

• Arm 1  (Direct Roll -Over Extension) – Arm 1 is only an option for s ubjects who successfully 
complete The RESTFUL  Study after enrollment to CT-05 begins  at a given clinical site ; Arm 1 
involves a 24 -wk extension period of NTX100 device use followed by a n 8-wk period without 
device use.  
• Arm 2  (Control Group) – Arm 2 is an option for subjects  who successfully complete the 
RESTFUL  Study before  enrollment to CT-05 begins  at a given clinical site  or subjects who 
decline to participate in Arm 1. Subjects enrolled in Arm 2 will not receive treatment with the 
NTX100 device.  Arm 2 involves  follow -up phone calls to access  on RLS progression and 
medication usage at 8 -wks, 16 -wks, and 24 -wks after the e nd of The RESTFUL Study .  Subjects 
who are consented more than 8 -wks after The RESTFUL  Study completion  will only complete 
the remaining follow -ups (e.g. subjects consented 12 -wks after The RESTFUL  Study will only  
complete the 16 -wk and 24 -wk follow -ups).  
• Arm 3  (Delayed Extension) –  Arm 3 is only an option for subjects who  successfully  complete 
The RESTFUL Study before enrollment to CT -05 begins at a given clinical site; like Arm 1, Arm 
3 involves a 24 -wk extension period of NTX100 device use followed by a n 8-wk period without 
device use.  Enrollment in Arm 3 of the study  begins a fter a  fixed delay upon  close -out of the 
RESTFUL  Study; the fixed delay will be >= 24 -wks and <= 52 -wks, will be the same value for all 
subjects (+/ - 2-wks), and will be determined based on investigational device availability and 
other constraints.  The sponsor will notify each site once Arm 3 is open to enroll study subjects  
for that site .

legs over the head of the fibula bone, a position where the peroneal nerve is close  to the skin.  This 
nerve target innervates regions of the lower extremities commonly associated with RLS 
symptoms.  
8.2.2.  Dosage and dosage regimen  
The dosage regimen depends on the intensity , timing, and duration of stimulation:  
1. Intensity .  The setpoint stimulation intensity may be the lesser of (a) the maximal intensity that 
the subject reports is non- distracting and comfortable, as determined in the calibration  session 
described in the instructions for device use  and (b) the maximal intensity for each set of 
stimulation parameters, as determined based on device output capabilities.   Subjects may be 
allowed to adjust stimulation intensity from the setpoint stimulation intensity , but only within a 
limited pre -progra mmed range.  For example,  the subject  may increase intensity if symptoms are 
severe or reduce intensity if symptoms are mild.  
2. Timing . Subject s may  be instructed to administer stimulation primarily after  RLS symptoms 
become noticeable and before the RLS symptoms become severe.  
3. Duration . Each session of stimulation may last  30 minutes.  Stimulation may be activated for up 
to 120 minutes per day  (e.g., up to 4 x 30 -minute sessions) , depending on the timing, duration, 
and severity of RLS symptoms for the specific subject.    
8.3.  Contraindications  
The following are contraindications to device usage:  
• Diagnosis of e pilepsy or other seizure disorder,  
• Active medical device  implant anywhere in the body , including but not limited to 
pacemakers , spinal cord stimulators, deep brain stimulators  
• Metal implant at the site of study device application 
• Known allergy to device materials (or severe previous reaction to medical adhesives or 
bandages)  
• Cellulitis, open sores , or acute injury at or near the lo cation of device electrode application

9. Risks  
9.1. Investigational device risks  
NPNS devices such as NTX100 Neuromodulation System  result in a known potential for the following 
anticipated observations, which are typically mild to moderate , transient in nature , and resolve over 
time.  
o Mild skin irritation from use of adhesive electrodes and/or secondary attachment 
mechanism.  
o Discomfort, paresthesia, or otherwise irritating or uncomfortable sensations during active electrical stimulation.   
 This risk is reduced by calibrating the stimulation intensity.  
o Temporary interference with sleep while wearing the device:  
 For some individ uals, device may be uncomfortable, thus interfering with sleep 
while wearing the device.  
 For some individuals, this device may interfere with preferred sleep positions, 
thus interfering with sleep during usage.  
o Temporary increase in RLS symptoms while wear ing the device:  
 For some individuals, this device may interfere with voluntary leg movements 
used to relieve RLS symptoms, thus leading to a temporary increase in RLS symptoms.  
 In some cases, this device may otherwise lead to a temporary increase in RLS symptoms during active stimulation for other reasons.  
• This risk may be  reduced by calibrating the stimulation intensity  and/or 
adjusting the schedule of stimulation.  
10.  Adverse Events  
Anticipated observations (e.g. common treatment effects) and adverse events occurring during the 
study will be recorded. Descriptions of anticipated observations and AEs will include the date of onset, 
the date it ended, the severity, the relationship to study device, and the outcome.  All reported AEs

will be summarized by the nu mber of subjects reporting AEs, system organ class  (where applicable) , 
severity, seriousness, and relationship to study device.  
The study Investigator and Coordinator will evaluate, characterize and record in the  electronic Case 
Report Form  (eCRF) all adverse events (AEs) occurring in all subjects from the time of enrollment to 
study exit (or premature withdrawal).  Adverse events unresolved at study exit will be followed by the 
Investigator until resolution occurs or at least 30 days after the subject’s participation in the study is 
complete.  AEs may be reported spontaneously by the subject or detected by the Investigator or 
Coordinator.  AEs should be evaluated for diagnoses not just symptoms (i.e., “angina”, not “chest pain”).  
In addition to verbatim terms, the Sponsor may  categorize all AEs using MedDRA preferred terms (PT) 
and system organ classes (SOC).  Analysis may  report both verbatim and MedDRA terms.  
10.1. Adverse Event Definitions  
An adverse event  (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence, indepe ndent of its association with the 
investigational device.  AEs also include any adverse laboratory signs or physical exam findings.   
A serious adverse event  (SAE
1) is any AE that:  
• led to a death,  
• led to a serious deterioration in the health of the subject that:  
• resulted in a life -threatening illness or injury,  
• resulted in a permanent impairment of a body structure or a body function,  
• required in -patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization,  
• resulted in medical or surgical inte rvention to prevent permanent impairment to body 
structure or a body function  
• or led to fetal distress, fetal death or a congenital abnormality or birth defect.  
A device- related SAE  is an event meeting the SAE definition above that is also rated as probably or 
definitely related the investigational device. No device -related SAEs have been reported in prior

studies.  Note that a n elective or pre -planned hospitalization for a condition that did not worsen during 
the study is not an AE . 
An unanticipated serious  adverse device effect  (USADE) is any SAE that is caused by, or associated 
with, a device, if that effect, problem, or death was not previously identified in nature, severity, or 
degree of incidence in the investigational plan or application (including a supplementary plan or application) . 
10.2. AE Severity and Relatedness  
Each AE occurring in the study will be characterized by the study Investigator as to severity ( Table  1) 
and relatedness ( Table  2). 
 
Table 1.  AE Severity Grading System.

Grade  Relationship of 
AE to study 
device  Description  
5 Definite  An event that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from 
administration of the study device; that follows a known or 
expected response pattern to the study device; and that is confirmed by improvement on stopping.  
4 Probable  An event that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from 
administration of the study device; that follows a known or expected response pattern to the study device; and that is unlikely to have been caused by concurrent/underlying illness 
or other drugs, procedures, or other causes.  
3 Possible  An event that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from 
administration of the study device; that follows a known or expected response pattern to the study device; but may have 
been caused by concurrent/underlying illness, drug s
, procedure, 
or other causes.  
2 Unlikely  An event that does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence 
from administration of the study device; that does not follow a 
known or expected response pattern to the study device, or 
most likely was caused by concurrent/underlying illness, drug s, 
procedure, or other causes, because of their known effects.  
1 Not related  An event almost certainly caused by concurrent/underlying 
illness, drug s, procedure, or other causes.  
* AE s occurring before treatment with the study device will be categorized as unrelated to the study 
device.  
10.3. Adverse Event Reporting  
Investigators must report all SAEs to the study Sponsor and governing IRB within 3 business days or 
according to local IRB guid elines .  Investigators should call the study  sponsor  immediately upon 
becoming aware of the occurrence of an SAE.   The sponsor  will contact  the independent medical 
reviewer, to assist in assessing any safety concerns, if needed. The Investigator should be a ble and 
willing to provide further information on the specific event when requested by the study Sponsor.   If 
the Investigator learns of an SAE that occurs within 1 month after the subject completes the study,

he/she should notify the Sponsor.  Investigato rs must also report all AEs to the governing IRB as 
determined by that IRB . 
Prompt AE evaluation:  
• protects the safety of study subjects;  
• aids in understanding the overall safety profile of the device;  
• prompts, if necessary, modification to the study protocol  
• allows improvements in study design or procedures; and  
• adheres with standard good clinical practices.  
11.  Device Tracking  
The Sponsor will send the  investigational devices  to the  Investigator. The Investigator must house 
study devices in a secure location.   
The Investigator must carefully and completely track receipt, use and disposition of all investigational 
devices. The Sponsor will track sending and receiving of devices.  The  Sponsor will monitor site device 
accountability periodically.  
If a Sponsor representative or designee is present at the time of use, he/she may directly take 
possession of used device(s). All devices will be returned to the Sponsor after the study is complete.  
The investigational device may include components that are consumable or semi- consumable and 
may be replaced on a periodic or as -needed basis.  Such device replacement can occur via an in -
person exchange or via delivery to the subject  via courier fro m the site . 
12.  Device Deficiencies and Malfunctions  
Throughout the study, the Investigator and study staff will report and document all device deficiencies and malfunctions related to the identity, quality, durability, reliability, safety or performance of t he 
device.  This includes reporting of device deficiencies/malfunctions that did not lead to an AE but could have if: 1) suitable action had not been taken, 2) intervention had not been made, or 3) 
circumstances had been less fortunate.  If possible, the I nvestigator should return devices suspected 
of deficiency or malfunction to the Sponsor for analysis.

The IRB -approved consent form must include all elements required by FDA, state, and local 
regulations, and may include appropriate additional elements.  
The Investigator/designee will explain the study to each potential subject and the subject must 
indicate voluntary consent by signing and dating the approved informed consent form. The Investigator must provide the subject with a copy of the consent form in a language the subject understands. The Investigator will maintain documentation that informed consent was obtained prior to the initiation of any study -specific procedures.  
Withdrawal of IRB approval of the Investigator’s part in th e investigation must be reported to the 
Sponsor within 5 working days.  
13.4. Protocol Compliance  
The Investigator will comply to the extent possible with the IRB -approved protocol.  All deviations 
from the protocol must be documented.  The Investigator will noti fy the Sponsor immediately if a 
deviation from the protocol was required to protect subject safety.  
13.5. Protocol Revisions  
Revisions to the study protocol can be made only by the study Sponsor. A revised protocol can be put into place only after governing IRB approval.  All administrative letters must be submitted to 
the IRB for their information.  
New or altered consent forms  required by the IRB due to a protocol change must be signed by all 
subjects currently enrolled in the study and must be used for any subsequent subject enrollment.  
13.6. Study Monitoring  
Representatives of the Sponsor will conduct either on-site or virtual oversite visits for all study 
sites to perform monitoring and data management functions, and provide participating sites with 
relevant contact information, as necessary.  Study monitors may change periodically over the

course of this study.  All monitors will be qualified to perform their assigned responsibilities, and 
participating investigators/site personnel will be notified of any changes as they occur.    
On-site and/or remote  monitoring of all participating sites will be frequent enough to assure 
continued acceptability of the data by assessing site compliance with the study protocol, 
adherence to data collection procedures, and maintenance of study records.  Scheduled site visits 
will include, but are not limited to, the following:  
• Site initiation visit : prior to enrolling subjects, an on -site or remote  initiation visit will be 
conducted by clinical study personnel to review this study protocol and discuss e CRF 
completion and transmittal procedures.  Alternatively, a meeting may be conducted for several sites at a common location.  
• Interim monitoring site visit : on-site and/or remote  monitoring visits will be conducted at all 
sites to assess the progress of the study and identify any concerns that result from review of the study records, study management documents, or subject informed consent documents.  To assure the integrity of the data, a representative number of individual subject records and 
other supporting documents will be compared to e CRFs completed at the site to determine 
that:  
o The study protocol is being followed, and only eligible subjects are being enrolled; 
variances, if they occur, are recorded and reported as appropriate.  
o Informed consent is properly documented.  
o Adverse events are being reported appropriately.  
o Information recorded on e CRFs is complete, accurate and legible.  
o Subjects failing to complete the clinical study and the reason for failure are properly 
recorded.  
• Final monitoring/Close -out site visit : a final visit to participating sites may be made by the study 
monitor, if necessary. Any ongoing responsibilities will be discussed with the investigator and/or site personnel as appropriate.

Page 30 of 54 
 
At the close of the study at an investigational site, appropriately trained personnel appointed by 
the Sponsor will perform a clos e-out process via the telephone or on- site.  The purpose of this visit 
is to collect all outstanding study data documents, ensure that the investigator's files are accurate 
and complete, review record retention requirements, ensure final accounting of all investigational 
devices shipped to the investigator, provide for appropriate disposition of any remaining supplies, and ensure that all applicable requirements are met for the study.  The observations and actions made during the intervention will be docume nted and communicated to the investigator.  
Representatives of government regulatory authorities may also evaluate the study records, source documents, Investigator, study staff and facilities.  
The Investigator should immediately notify the Sponsor of any a udits of this study by any 
regulatory agency, and must promptly provide copies of any audit reports.  
13.7. Safety Reporting  
The Sponsor is responsible for ongoing safety evaluation in this study protocol.  Sponsor activities regarding safety include:  
• classificat ion of all AEs  
• review of all AEs reported in the study  
• confirm site’s classification of AEs in terms of severity and relatedness to the study device  
• review of severity and relatedness with the study Investigator, especially when there is disagreement between the Investigator and the sponsor  
• review of device deficiencies and malfunctions, including determination and documentation 
of whether deficiencies/malfunctions could have led to an SAE  
• ensuring the reporting of all SAEs and device deficiencies/malfunctions that could have led to 
an SAE to the IRB and, if required, regulatory authorities in a timely fashion  
• informing all site Investigators in writing of all SAEs at all sites in a timely fashion  
• updating the risk analysis and assessment o f corrective or preventive actions potentially 
required as a result of new information obtained in the investigation

The Sponsor will evaluate all serious adverse events against US reporting requirements (Medical 
Device Reporting, 21 CFR 812) and Medical Device Directive (vigilance incident reporting) as per 
its standard operating procedures.  The Sponsor will investigate each SAE to determine whether the event represents an unanticipated serious adverse device effect (USADE, see Section 7).  The 
Sponsor w ill report any event to regulatory authorities, Investigators and reviewing IRBs/ECs as 
necessary. If an investigation shows that a USADE presents an unreasonable risk to subjects, the Sponsor will terminate all investigations or parts of investigations presenting that risk as soon as possible. The Sponsor will only resume a terminated investigation after corrective actions have taken place, site Investigators are informed and IRBs/ECs have been notified and given approval to resume the study.  
13.8. Electronic Case Report Forms /Electronic Data Capture  
The study will use an electronic data capture (EDC) system to implement electronic case report forms (eCRF).  Data collected throughout the duration of the study will be entered directly into 
the EDC system.  The system will allow compliance with 21 CFR 11  Electronic Signatures.  All CRF’s 
are housed in the EDC system.  The Investigator and Coordinator will be trained in use of the eCRF prior to study initiation. Retraining in use of EDC can occur at any time. The EDC system will be validated prior to use  and after any modification is made . Each eCRF will be designed to 
accommodate the specific features of the trial design.  Modification of a e CRF will only be made if 
deemed necessary by the study sponsor.  
An eCRF is required and should be completed for each  included subject. The Investigator has 
ultimate responsibility for the collection and reporting of all data entered on the e CRFs and 
ensuring that they are accurate, authentic/original, attributable, complete, consistent, legible, timely (contemporaneous) , enduring and available when required. The eCRFs  must be signed by 
the investigator to attest that the data contained therein are true.

The site will be provided with general eCRF Completion Guidelines which will assist in data entry 
and data issues/questions. All persons allowed to enter or change e CRF data must appear on the 
Delegation of Responsibilities Log.  
The Sponsor will remotely monitor  the eCRFs to identify possible data errors.   The system will have 
a query mechanism whereby the site Coordinator can respond to Sponsor queries. All data 
discrepancies will be resolved prior to database lock.   
13.9. Quality Assurance Audits  
Sponsor representatives or designees may conduct site quality assurance (QA) audit s during the 
study.  The Investigator must agree to provide the auditor with direct access to all relevant 
documents and discuss any findings with the auditor.  
In the event of an inspection by the FDA or other regulatory author ities, the Investigator must give 
the inspector direct access to relevant documents and to discuss any findings with the inspector. The Investigator must notify Sponsor in the event of a FDA site audit.  
13.10.  Records Retention  
The Investigator must maintain all study records (including device disposition, informed consents, supporting  documents, correspondence, regulatory documents, contracts etc.) for at least 2 years 
after study completion.  At the Investigator’s discretion, a ll records may be sent to the Sponsor for 
permanent storage.  
The Investigator must contact the Sponsor or designee prior to destroying any records associated with this study.  If the Investigator withdraws from the study, all study -associated records must be 
transferred to a mutually agreed upon designee. Written notification of such a transfer must be given to the Sponsor or designee.

16. Study Procedures  
16.1. Overview  
Arms 1 and 3 involve a 24 -week extension of in -home investigational device usage for subjects who 
previously completed the  RESTFUL  Study, followed by an 8 -week period without investigational device 
usage to assess the progression of RLS following cessation of treatment.  Two separate arms are 
employed to maximize the number of subjects eligible for any extension phase (Arm 1 and Arm 3) 
while also maximizing the number of subjects who can proceed directly to the extension phase (Arm 1 only).   Notably, in the R ESTFUL  Study, subjects will have already completed either 4 -weeks of device 
usage (Sham   Active) or 8 -weeks (Active   Active) d epending on randomization.  Since site staff 
were  blinded to RESTFUL Study treatment assignment, no procedures in this protocol will be affected 
by RESTFUL Study treatment assignment.   
 Arm 2 serves as a control arm with matched duration to the 24 -week pe riod of investigational device 
usage; this arm is designed to the assess the changes to medication and RLS symptoms that occur under the conventional standard of care, in the absence of investigational device intervention.  
Although the duration of Arm 2 states 24 -weeks, each subjects participation will v ary, since the 24 -
week period also includes the time between when the subject exits  the RESTFUL study and when the y 
enroll in Arm 2 of the CT -05 study. For example, subjects who are consented more than 8 -wks after 
RESTFUL Study completion will only complete the remaining follow -ups (e.g. subjects consented 12 -
wks after the RESTFUL Study will only complete the 16 -wk and 24 -wk follow -ups).  
 
16.2. Comparison of Study Arms  
Arms 1 and 3 involve identical procedures, wit h the following exceptions:  
• Eligibility  
a. [Arm 1] Only open to subjects who complete the RESTFUL  Study after  this protocol 
opens to enrollment at a given site - and thus can directly enter this protocol.

Any reproduction in part or whole without the written permission of Noctrix Health, Inc. is prohibited.     
Page 36 of 54 
 
b. [Arm 3] Only open to subjects who completed the RESTFUL  Study before  this protocol 
opens to enrollment at a given site -  and thus have some delay before entering this 
protocol).  Subjects who have completed Arm 2 remain eligible for Arm 3.  
• Delay  
a. [Arm 1] T here is typically no delay between RESTFUL  Study completion and Arm 1 
entry .  A delay of  up to  2-days is permitted if needed.  
b. [Arm 3] There is a fixed delay between R ESTFUL  Study completion and Arm 3 entry .  
The fixed delay will be >= 24 -wks and <= 52 -wks,  will be the same value for all subjects 
(+/- 2-wks), and will be determined based on investigational device availability and 
other constraints.   
• Baseline  
a. [Arm 1] Baseline refers to RESTFUL  Study entry (Eval 1 of R ESTFUL  Study).  
b. [Arm 3] Baseline refers to  entry to this protocol (Eval 1 of this protocol).  
• Assessments at Eval 1  
a. [Arm 1] The IRLS and MOS- Sleep data from are not administered at Eval 1, because 
they are administered on the same day at Restful Study Eval 11.  
b. [Arm 3] The IRLS and MOS- Sleep are administered at Eval 1.  
 
Arm 2 differs significantly from Arm 1 and 3 : 
• Eligibility  
a. [Cohort 2A] Subjects  who completed the RESTFUL  Study after  this protocol opens to 
enrollment are eligible for Arm 2 only if they decide not to participate in Arm 1 .  All 
subjects in this group are first given the choice to participate in Arm 1 without 
knowledge of the alternative Arm 2.  
b. [Cohort 2B] All  subjects who completed R ESTFUL  Study  less than 24 -wks before  this 
protocol opens to enrollment are eligible for Arm 2.

a. [Cohort 2A] There is typically no delay between RESTFUL Study completion and Arm 2  
entry .  A delay of  up to  2-days is permitted if needed.  
b. [Cohort 2B] There is a variable delay between R ESTFUL  Study completion and Arm 2 
entry, depending on the time that the subject completed the Restful Study.  Subjects 
will be enrolled either 8 -wks, 16 -wks, or 24 -wks after completion of the R ESTFUL  Study, 
+/- 1-wk. 
• Completion  
a. Both Cohorts 2A and 2B are completed 24- wks after completion of the R ESTFUL  Study 
+/- 1-week.  Therefore, the duration of study participation in Arm 2 depends on the 
delay between R ESTFUL  Study completion and enrollment in this study.  
• Baseline  
a. For both Cohorts 2A and 2B, baseline  refers to R ESTFUL  Study entry (Eval 1 of Restful 
Study).

16.3. Recruitment  
Enrollment is limited to subjects who have completed the R ESTFUL  Study and meet the inclusion and 
exclusion criteria in Section 7.  A pre -screening call may  be completed to assess eligibility  prior to the 
in-person visit  and may be performed by  a sponsor -appointed representative .  Eligibility will be 
contingent on sche duling constraints, such as research facility and research staff availability . 
16.3.1.  Order of recruitment  
For Arm 1, eligible subjects  at a given site  will be recruited in the order that they complete the 
RESTFUL  Study, with the constraint that subjects will only be eligible if they complete the R ESTFUL  
Study after enrollment to this study opens at that site.  
For Arm 3, if e nrollment or enrollment rate for a specific Arm and/or a specific site is limited –  
such as  by device availability, research facility and research staff availability, or other constraints  
– then eligible subjects at a given site will be invited to this study  in the order that they complete d 
the RESTFUL  Study.   
These  procedure s are intended to m inimize selection bias  in recruitment .  The actual order of 
enrollment for each Arm may differ  depending on the responsiveness of each given subjec t that 
is invited and the ability of the subject and site to schedule Eval 1 for that subject  in a timely 
man ner. 
 
16.4. Informed consent Process  
All subjects must be provided a consent form describing the study with sufficient information for 
subjects to make an informed decision regarding their participation.  The informed consent form will 
clearly indicate the Arm to which the subject is providing consent.  If a given subject completes more 
than one Arm (e.g. Arm 2 followed by Arm 3), the subject wi ll complete a separate consent form prior 
to enrollment in each Arm.  
Subject s must sign the IRB approved informed consent prior to participation in any study specific 
procedure , with the exception of pre -screening . The subject must receive a paper or elect ronic copy 
of the signed and dated consent document. The signed copy of the consent document must be

retained in the study binder in paper or electronic  format.  The schedule of visits and procedures is 
provided in Table  4 (Arms 1 and 3) and Table 6 (Arm 2) .   
If a study  site has a formal process  for eConsent, the y may elect to obtain informed consent virtually . 
Sites who do not currently have a process may elect to use the eConsent service provided by the EDC 
vendor.   
16.5. Screening  
Potential subject s will be sc reened for eligibility  based on the criteria in Section 7 above .  A potential 
subject  who signs the study consent and is eligible  will be assigned the same  study ID number  assigned 
to them  during t he RESTFUL  Study , will be considered enrolled,  and will count towards the study’s 
sample size.    
16.6. Device calibration  
During the RESTFUL Study , the stimulation intensity of the investigational device was calibrated 
separate ly for each subject and for each leg.   The calibration process is designed to identify the 
maximally effective settings that are comfortable for each subject.  For Arm 1 and Arm 3, the same settings from the  RESTFUL Study will be used, except in cases where the subject’s responses indicate 
that these intensity levels are too high or too low.  In that case, the calibration process may be 
repeated either in full or in an abbreviated manner.  The sponsor may administer the calibration and/or assist in administering the calibration.  
Each time new stimulation units are provided to a subject during this study, such as with replacement devices, they must be programmed with the specific calibrated settings corresponding to that subject.  
16.7. Baseline Assessments   
Since this is an extension study to the  RESTFUL  Study, many of the baseline assessments for a given 
subject in Arm 1 and Arm 2 will refer to assessments completed during the RESTFUL Study , including 
the following : IRLS [12], Subject characterization, Medic al history , Refractory characterization, MOS-
Sleep (Medical Outcomes Study Sleep Scale [13]) , and Concomitant medications .  Subjects who have 
a delay between their participation of the RESTFUL study and the CT -05 Extension Study ( e.g. Arm 3  
participants ) will have some or all baseline assessment (s) repeated or re -affirmed.  
16.8. Device training

Page 40 of 54 
 
Subjects will have already received training on device usage in The RESTFUL  Study.  For subjects in 
Arm 3, due to the delay between The RESTFUL Study and A rm 3, training reminders may be needed 
on proper usage of the device, including positioning of the devices  on their legs.  Instrument(s) 
designed for marking the human skin (body -marking pen or temporary tattoo) may  be employed to 
mark the locations of electrode placement.   Device calibration may be adjusted during device training 
based on subjective feedback from the subject.  
16.9. Study Treatment Description  
For Arms 1 and 3 (but not Arm 2), s tudy subjects are instructed to self- administer treatment  nightly 
as needed  – typically after RLS symptoms start and before RLS symptoms become severe.  The 
instructions for timing of device use may be adjusted based on the timing of RLS symptoms 
experienced by the subject.  Once activated, a single session of treatment may run for approximately 
30 minutes and then turn off automatically.  Up to 120 total minutes per night  may be use d.  If device 
battery life limits  the number of uses per night, the following two timings of use may  be prioritized: 
(1) at bedtime, to reduce symptoms and thus help with sleep initiation, and (2) when waking up in the middle of the night, to reduce symptoms and thus help with sleep re -initiation.   Device intensity is 
typically set to the calibrated levels, but intensity may be increased if RLS symptoms are especially 
severe or decreased such as if RLS symptoms are mild.  
16.10.  Concomitant Medications and Treatments  
Concomitant medications and treatments are tracked throughout the study based on subject reported data.  For Arms 1 and 3 (but not Arm 2), s tudy subjects are instructed to maintain a stable dose and 
schedule of all concomitant medications and treatments for RLS and of all concomitant medications 
and treatments that affect RLS symptoms, including  antidepressants, sleep medications, or sedative 
antihistamines .   
16.11.  Leg movement data collection  
The NTX100 Neuromodulation System  may have the capability to collect data on leg movements, such 
as by using accelerometers and/or gyroscope sensors, while the subject is wearing the devices.  These 
data may be collected during this study and used for subsequent ana lysis and development.

The following evaluation calls and/or visits are scheduled, as outlined in Table s 4 and 6  below . A 
window of +/ - 4 days may be utilized on office follow- ups and a window of +/ - 2 days for any phone 
follow -up, as needed.   To reduce self -selection bias, is important to incentivize maximal participation 
of subjects from the R ESTFUL  Study in this study.  One method to incentivize participation is to reduce 
the requirement for in -person visits, which can be especially challenging for subjects who do not live 
within a short distance of the clinical site.    
 
Arms 1 and 3:  
Evaluation 1 : In-person  visit for e nrollment, including consent, screening,  and assessments.   For 
Arm 1, consent & screening will typically occur on the same visit as Eval 11 for the R ESTFUL  Study.  
If the subject’s schedule does not permit completion of assessments during this office visit, then

16.13.  Device replacement  in Arms 1 and 3 
The investigational device may include components that are consumable or semi -consumable and 
may be replaced on a periodic or as -needed basis.  Such device component replacement may  occur 
via an in -person exchange or via delivery to the subject.  At entry to Arm 1, subjects may continue 
using investigational device  components from the R ESTFUL  Study prior to replacement –  which may 
require one additional visit for in -person exchange or may be conducted via delivery to the subject.

Typically, at Evals 4 and 6, stimulation unit replacement will occur and device log data will be 
downloaded to assess q uantitative complianc e and usage data  and follow -up with the subject 
regarding usage data.  To facilitate this process, subjects will be encouraged to attend an in -person 
visit.  For subjects who live further from the site and/or cannot easily travel to the site, replacement 
device  component s will be deliver ed to the subject and the subject will return used stimulation units 
to the site  for device log data analysis .  For these subjects, the Eval may be split into two parts, where 
the second part is conducted upon receipt of stimulation units at the site and involv es a call to follow -
up with the subject regarding usage data . 
Each time new stimulation units are provided to a subject during this study, they must be programmed with the specific calibrated settings corresponding to that subject.  
 
16.14.  Administration of assessments  
o PGI-I (Patient Global Impressions – Improvement Scale). T he subject will determine  the 
ratings, and the examiner should be available to clarify any misunderstandings the subject may 
have about the questions. The examiner or the subject may  mark  the subject’s answers on the 
form.  
o CGI-I (Clinical Global Impressions –  Improvement Scale) .  The CGI -I is completed by the 
Investigator  after conduct ing a short interview with the subject regarding their RLS symptoms 
over the past week compared to baseline.  The Investigator will  not be permitted  access to the 
subject’s IRLS responses  but will be permitted access to the subject’s PGI -I responses.  
o IRLS.  The subject will determine the ratings, and the examiner should be available to clarify 
any misunderstandings the subject may have about the questions. The examiner or the subject may mark the subject’s answers on the form.  
o MOS -Sleep .  The subject will determine the ratings, and the examiner should be available to 
clarify any misunderstandings the subject may have about the questions. The examiner or the subject may mark the subject’s answers on the form.

o SF-36. The subject will determine th e ratings, and the examiner should be available to clarify 
any misunderstandings the subject may have about the questions. The examiner or the subject 
may mark the subject’s answers on the form.  
o The Weekly Questionnaire  will be completed by the subject .   
o The Bi-weekly Questionnaire  will be completed by the subject  every 2 weeks during Weeks 
25-32 of Arms 1 and 3.   
o Subject characterization  will be completed by the examiner (site staff) based on information 
from the subject .  Subject characterization information may be transferred from the database 
for the RESTFUL Study, if such information is available and has not changed.  
o Medical history  will be completed by the examiner (site staff) based on information from the 
subject. Medical history information may be transferred from the database for t he RESTFUL 
Study, if such information is available and has not changed.  
16.15.  Study Exit  
Study exit will occur at the conclusion of Eval # 9.  At study exit , the Investigator/coordinator will 
complete the study exit e CRF.  Adverse events unresolved at study exit will be followed by the 
Investigator until resolution occurs or at least 30 days after the subject’s participation in the study is 
complete.  
16.16.  Subject Discontinuation  
A subject may be removed  from the study prior to completion for any of the following reasons:  
• Voluntary withdrawal of consent  
• Adverse event preventing further study participation  
• Investigator believes risk of further subject participation outweig hs benefit  
• Persistent non- compliance or lost to follow -up 
• Pregnancy  
• Subject no longer meets inclusion criteria  
• [For arms 1 and 3 only] S ubject makes a significant change to  dosage of medications known to 
interfere with sleep or RLS symptoms, including sleep medications, antidepressants, sedative 
antihistamines.

• [For arms 1 and 3 only] Insufficient device availability  (see 16.16.1 below)  
16.16.1.  Discontinuation related to device avail ability  
As noted in Section 11, the investigational device may include components that are consumable 
or semi- consumable and may be replaced on a periodic or as -needed basis.  In the unlikely event 
that investigational device supply becomes insufficient to  replenish the consumable components 
of the devices for all subjects enrolled in the study, enrollment will be paused and device replacement will continue in a normal manner until the device supply for the study is exhausted (or nearly exhausted).  At that point, remaining subjects will be removed from the study at their 
next scheduled device replacement timepoint.  
Additionally, it is possible that some patterns of device use or misuse may lead to a reduction in the functional lifespan of the investigational device below 8 -weeks.  If this is suspected for a 
specific subject, that subject may be removed from the study.  
 
The Investigator  or research staff  will complete a study exit form in the e CRF for any subject who 
prematurely discontinues from the study.  If discontinuation was the result of an AE, the AE will also be recorded in the e CRF.  
Upon discontinuation, subjects will receive partial compensation commensurate with their completed 
Phase s. 
16.6. Study Termination  
The Sponsor may terminate the study as a whole or at individual study sites under the following 
circumstances:  
• Suspicion of risk to subjects, including occurrence of high rate of known AEs or unexpectedly 
high rate of unexpected AEs  
• Poor site compliance with the study protocol  
• Inadequate site enrollment  
• Obtaining new scientific knowledge that shows that the study is no longer valid or necessary  
• Persistent non- compliance with IRB or regulatory requirements  
• Persistent failure to comply with obligations arising from the clinical trial agreement

• Insufficient availability of investigational devices  
• Other business reasons (e.g., insolvencies or business entity liquidation)  
The sponsor will document reasons for study suspension and notify relevant site Investigators  and 
governing IRBs.  If suspension occurred because of a safety issue, all Investigators will be notified. 
When terminating the study, the sponsor and Investigator will assure that adequate consideration is 
given to the protection of the subjects’ interests.   
17.  Study Endpoints and Analysis Overview  
17.1. Treatment of data from  the RESTFUL Study  
CT-05 is an extension of the RESTFUL Study and Arms 1 and 2 involve a direct roll -over from the RESTFUL 
Study into CT -05.  Therefore, data from the RESTFUL Study (CT -04) will be used to define the Baseline for 
Arms 1 and 2 and may be used to define subgroup analyses and demographic  characterization.  
17.2. Efficacy  
17.2.1.  Primary Efficacy Endpoint  
Arm 1 : The  primary outcome measure will be responder rate on the CGI -I scale at Week 2 4 of Arm  1 
relative to entry  to the RESTFUL Study .   
Arm 3 : The primary outcome measure will be responder rate on the CGI -I scale at Week 24 of Arm 3 
relative to CT -05 study entry.   
Responder rate for the 7 -point CGI -I scale will be defined as the proportion of responses of “Much 
Improved” or “Very Much Improved”.   
17.2.2.  Key Secondary Efficacy Endpoints  
Arm 1:  
1. PGI-I responder rate (defined as for CGI -I) at Wk-24 relative to entry to t he RESTFUL Study . 
2. Mean reduction in IRLS  score  at Week 24 of Arm 1 relative to entry to t he RESTFUL Study . 
3. Mean reduction in MOS -II score at Week 24 of Arm 1 relative to entry to the RESTFUL Study . 
4. Mean reduction in MOS -I score at Week 24 of Arm 1 relative to entry to the RESTFUL Study .

05 study  entry . 
Definition and instructions for calculation of the Medical Outcomes Study Sleep Problems Index I and II 
are described in [ 13]. 
 17.2.3.  Efficacy Analysis  
A Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) will be developed prior to completion of the first subject in Arm 1  or 3, 
which will include  a plan for efficacy analysis.   The following analyses are planned:  
• Primary s tatistical analysis may  be conducted separately for subjects in Arms 1 and Arm 3.   
Additional pooled analysis across Arms 1 and 3 may also be conducted.   
• Subgroup analysis form Arms 1 and 3 may  be conducted based on the following criteria:  
o Responders at Week -8 of The  RESTFUL  Study, as defined by CGI -I of 1 or 2.  
o Non -responders at Week -8 of The  RESTFUL  Study, as defined by CGI -I of 3 or above . 
• Missing data may  be addressed with the use of multiple imputation.   
• Appropriate statistical techniques will be employed to test statistical significance.   
• If there is success on the primary endpoint, then secondary endpoints will be tested in order, 
according to the fix ed-sequence method, until failure.  
The analysis cohort for the primary efficacy endpoint are subjects who are enrolled  and undergo the 
assigned treatment.   
The Per Protocol analysis will exclude subjects  for whom one or more of the  following apply : 
1. Dropou t or removal from the study.  
2. Incomplete or missing data for the endpoint.

3. Clinically significant change in dose or schedule of medication that affects RLS symptoms .  
4. New medical information available after randomization indicates an exclusion criterion.  
5. Other protocol deviation occurs that is deemed clinical ly significant by the investigator.   
6. Device usage at or after bedtime on fewer than two -thirds of the nights with RLS symptoms at 
or after bedtime, as reported by the subject on the Weekly  Questionnaire assessments.  
7. Missing two or more  follow -ups (Follow -ups completed out- of-window are not considered 
“missing”)  
8. Zero total device uses.  
17.2.4.  Additional efficacy analyses  
Comparison of Arm 1 (investigational device) to Arm 2 (control)  
Arm 1 and Arm 2 both cover the same period of time –  the 24 -wks after completion of the RESTFUL 
Study).  Arm 1 involves continual open- label usage of the investigational device throughout this time 
period, whereas Arm 2 (control) involves no usage of the i nvestigational device.   Comparison of the 
data from these arms will be used to assess how continued use of the devices over 24 -weeks impacts 
RLS symptoms, sleep, and medication use relative to the typical standard of care over 24 -weeks.  
• For Arm 2, baseline will be defined as entry to CT -04 Restful Study and similar analyses will be 
conducted as in Arm 1.   
• Results from Wk -24 of Arm 2 (no device usage) will be compared to results from Wk -24 of Arm 1 
(device usage), to assess the effect of continued device usage on the following outcomes:  
o Changes in RLS symptoms, as measured by CGI -I, PGI- I, and IRLS  
o Changes in Sleep, as measured by MOS- II and MOS -I 
o Changes in quality of life, as measured by SF -36 
o Changes in the dose and type of concomitant medications prescribed and/or administered  to 
treat RLS  
Changes to symptom severity over time  
• Linear regression of PGI -I over all weeks of Active treatment*  
• Linear regression of IRLS over all weeks of Active treatment *

• Linear regression of Frequency of RLS symptoms over all weeks of Active treatment * (based on 
IRLS question #7)  
• Linear regression of MOS- II over all weeks of Active treatment *  
• Linear regression of MOS- I over all weeks of Active treatment * 
* For Arm 1, this starts  at the beginning of Active treatment in the RESTFUL Study .  For Arm 3, this 
starts at entry to Arm 3 . 
 
Additional s ubgroup analys es 
• Subjects assigned to Sham control for Weeks 1 -4 of t he RESTFUL  Study  
• Subjects assigned to Active treatment for Weeks 1 -4 of the RESTFUL  Study  
 
17.3. Safety  
17.3.1.   Safety Endpoints  
The safety endpoint will be a descriptive analysis of adverse events (AEs) for both study arms, 
classified and tabulated by seriousness, relationship to the device, and severity.  
17.3.2.  Safety Analysis  
Frequency charts of adverse events occurring at any time during the study will be produced.  The 
proportion of subjects in Arms 1 and 3 reporting on e or more adverse events between study entry 
and Week 24  will be pooled and tabulated.  Similar analyses will be done for SAEs and device -
related SAEs. Safety analysis will include all subjects who were treated.  A Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) will be developed prior to completion of the first subject in Arm 1 or 3 , which may  include 
additional  plan s for safety analysis.      
17.4. Compliance  
Compliance will be assessed during the first 24 -wks of Arm 1 and Arm 3.  Subjects will be instructed 
to use devices each nights that they report experiencing RLS symptoms.  Therefore, percentage compliance w ith device usage will be calculated using the fol lowing formula:  
100%*(nights of compliant use)/(total nights with patient -reported RLS symptoms)

• Nights of compliant use  will be measured based on digital tracking of the timing and duration of 
each NPNS device usage.  In cases where digital tracking log s are incomplete or unavailable, the 
data will not be included in the compliance analysis.  
• A “night of compliant use ” will be defined as a minimum of 25 minutes of active NPNS stimulation 
between noon  and noon  during an Assessment week.   
• “Total assessment nights with RLS symptoms” will be defined as the total nights spent by all 
subjects in Assessment weeks when the subject reports RLS symptoms on the Weekly  
questionnaire.   
• If a subject is discontinued from the study for reasons unrelated to subject response to treatment, 
compliance data will only be assessed up until the time of discontinuation.  Such reasons could include lack of device availability, personal reasons, or adverse event unrelated to the study device.  
17.5. Exploratory Analysis  
Additional statistical analysis that is exploratory in nature may be performed  with CT-05 data alone 
and/or with pooled data from CT-05 and from t he RESTFUL Study.  
18. Remote procedures  
 
During and after the COVID- 19 pandemic, replacing some in -person visits with remote interactions may 
be necessary, for example to reduce risk to subjects and/or to comply with local, state, or federal 
regulations.  In such cases, the study records will indicate which in -person visits were replaced with 
remote interactions.   The allowable study duration may be expanded as needed to allow delay intervals for mailing and receiving programmed devices.  
In such cases, one of more of the following approaches may be taken:  
1. Remote calibration and training.  Remote calibration and training, where possible, will be coordinated by mailing a calibration/training device to the subject, conducting calibration and training via a video call using the calibrat ion/training device, and then mailing programmed

devices to the subject using the settings determined during the calibration.  Alternatively, the 
same devices used in the study may be used for calibration/training.  
2. Remote follow -up visits.  Remote follow -up visits, where possible, will be completed via call or 
video call, during which the required study assessments will be administered.   
3. Devices may be returned using a pre -paid mailing label, as needed.  
4. Remote consent.  Remote consent procedures will follo w the recommendations set forth in the 
“FDA Guidance on Conduct of Clinical Trials of Medical Products during COVID -19 Public Health 
Emergency ” [14].   For example, or more of the following procedures listed in the guidance will be 
used to confirm consent:  
a. eConsent via a compliant digital platform;  
b. confirmation of consent by an impartial witness via three -way call or video conference;  
c. remote explanation of consent followed by in- person signature of informed consent 
document (to minimize duration of in- perso n interaction).

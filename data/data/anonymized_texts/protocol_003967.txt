Exploratory Objectives  
(Each DB Period) : •  
 
  
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
  
 
 
  
  
Number of Patients:  Approximately 100 patients will be randomized. Patients who 
discontinue study participation prior to completing the study 
will not be replaced.  
  
Study Design : This is a randomized, 2 DB treatment period  dosing study, to 
be conducted at multiple centers in the United States . 
Previously diagnosed patients with a history of episodic 
migraine (as defined by International Classification of 
Headache Disorders, 3rd edition [beta version]1 [ICHD-3] ), 
who experience an average of 2 to 8 migraine attacks per 
month for at least the past 12 months, with no more than 
14 headache days per month, and with 48 hours of 
headache- free time between migraine headaches , will be 
randomized in a 1:1 ratio in both DB periods  to receive either 
DFN- 02 (sumatriptan nasal spray) 10 mg or a matching 
placebo.   
There will be a screening period to evaluate whether the 
patient fit s the migraine inclusion criteria and does  not have 
medication overuse.  Patients with at least a 12- month 
medical history of acute migraine will be eligible for

 enrollment in the treatment period. Patients will con tinue to 
take their normal migraine medication during this screening 
period.  
Randomized patients  will be instructed to use the study 
medication in 1 migraine attack as soon as (and no more than 
within 1 hour after) experiencing moderate to severe pain 
(defined as headache pain rating  of Grade 2 [moderate] or 
Grade  3 [severe] on pain severity scale of 0 to 3 ). Patients will 
return to the study site within 2 to 7 days in the DB1 treatment 
period and, if continuing to be eligible, will be re -randomized 
into a DB2 treatment period t o receive either DFN -02 
(sumatriptan nasal spray ) 10 mg or a matching placebo to 
treat 1 migraine attack at any pain level. They will then return 
to the study site within 2 to 7  days of their second treatment 
for study completion as sessments. Once randomized, the 
total duration of each patient’s participation in the study would be up to 10 weeks.  
After using the first dose of study medication in their migraine 
attack , patients will have the option to take another dose of 
study medication for the same attack if they experience relief 
but feel it is insufficient , or, if required, take rescue medication  
more than 2 hours after  the first dose and after completing in 
the electronic diary ( eDiary ) the 2 hours postdose 
assessments. No more than 2 doses of study medication will 
be taken in a 24- hour period . Rescue medication will be 
decided between the Investigator  and the patient.  
During both treatment periods, data regarding the study 
medication effect on pain and symptoms and the associated 
impact on function and the patient’s satisfaction with the study 
medication will be collected.  Patients will record criteria in 
real-time in an eDiary that will include, but is not limited to, the 
date and time of each migraine attack, the occurr ence of 
aura, predose pain level, date and time of study medication 
use, postdose pain level, symptoms and functional disability, 
treatment satisfaction , and date and time of rescue 
medication. The eDiary will be reviewed for compliance and 
rescue medicati on. Data will be entered into the electronic 
case report form (eCRF). After study  completion or early 
termination, patients should be referred to their usual 
healthcare professional to resume pre- study standard of care, 
as per the Investigator discretion.  
  
Treatment:  For the DB1 treatment period, all patients will be randomly 
assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either  DFN- 02 10 mg or a 
matching placebo t o be used in 1 migraine attack as soon as 
(and no more than within 1 hour after) experiencing moderate 
to severe pain. Eligible p atient s will then be re- randomized in 
a 1:1 ratio into the DB2 period to receive either DFN- 02 
10 mg or a matching placebo to treat another migraine attack

 at any pain level . In each treated migraine attack , study 
medication may be repeated once (if needed) , more than 2 
hours  after the initial dose and after completing in the eDiary 
the 2 hour s postdose assessments . 
  
Study Duration:  The duration of study participation will be up to approximately 
13 weeks, including a screening period of approximately 
3 weeks ( wherein patients may be randomized earlier than 3 
weeks provided they meet inclusion/exclusion criteria and 
headache assessment criteria; the screening period may also 
be extended based on Investigator judgment and in 
consultation with the Medical Monitor), 2  DB treatment 
periods with up to 4 weeks (each period) for patients to 
experience and treat migraine attack s, and 2 to 7 days for 
patients to retu rn to the site after treatment. The 2 DB 
treatment periods combined would total up to 10  weeks.  
  
Study Population:  Male and female patients 18 to 75 years of age, inclusive, 
previously diagnosed with ICHD -3 episodic migraine who 
experience 2 to 8 migraine attacks per month for at least the 
past 12 months, with no more than  14 headache days per 
month , and  with at least 48  hours of headache- free time 
between migraine headaches , will be included. Migraines can 
be with or without aura, but the aura cannot last longer than 
60 minutes.  
Patients with medication overuse, patients who use 
mini- prophylaxis for menstrual migraine, patients who have 
been on unstable doses of migraine prophylactic medications 
30 days prior to and through screening, and patients with 
migralepsy will be excluded.  See inclusion and exclusion 
criteria for addit ional study entry requirements. 
  
Primary Efficacy Endpoint 
(DB1 period) : Proportion of patients who are pain -free at 2 hours after the 
first dose of study medication compared between DFN -02 
and placebo ( defined as a reduction from predose moderate 
[Grade 2] or severe [Grade  3] pain to none [Grade 0])  
  
Secondary Endpoints:  Proportion of patient s who are pain -free at 2 hours after the 
first dose of study medication compared between DFN -02 
and placebo (any pain level) (DB2 period)  
 (Each DB Period):  
• Proportion of patients who are pain- free at 10,
  15, 20, 30, 
60, and 90 minutes  postdose 
• Proportion of patients who have pain relief at  10, 15, 20, 
30,
 60, 90 and 120 minutes postdose

 4 Introduction  
Migraine headache is a disabling neurological disorder with clinical findings of headache, 
often associated with nausea, photophobia, and phonophobia. In the United States ( US), 
about 17 % of all women and 6% of all men suffer from m igraine.2  
Although the exact mechanism of migraine headache is not known, the pathophysiology is 
related to alteration in the neurochemical balance of the brain to trigemin al-vascular 
activation and release of vasoactive peptides . Radiological investigations in migraine 
patients are characterized by hyperexcitation of neuronal networks in the occipital lobe of the 
cortex , the brainstem, and the trigeminal nerve ganglion.3,4 
Clinically, migraine with aura occurs in 5 phases: prodrome, aura, headache, resolution, and postheadache.  The prodr 
ome phase is associated with nonspecific symptoms such as 
fatigue,  muscle pain in the neck and head, cognitive impairment, anxiety, and irritability. 
Auras are focal  neurological changes typically of a visual or somatosensory nature, lasting 
less than 60 minutes.  Auras are considered to occur as the result of electrical disturbances 
in the brain. Auras occur in approximately 15% of migraine attacks. The headache phase 
can be divided into mild, moderate,  and severe phases. The mild phase is the peri od of time 
from headache awareness to the onset of  moderate pain.  
 
In general, the headache phase lasts  4 to 72 hours. The postheadache phase 
lasts up to 48 hours and is characterized with symptoms  similar to those of the prodrome.5,6 
Typical clinical characteristics of migraine headache are unilateral location, pulsating quality, 
moderate or sev
ere pain, aggravation by routine physical activity, and association with 
nausea and/or photophobia and phonophobia. It is important to initiate pharmacotherapy as 
early as possible to abort the migraine before it becomes severe and more resistant to 
treatment .7 
Several therapies such as triptans, ergot alkaloids, nonsteroidal anti -inflammatory  drugs 
(NSAIDs), aspirin and caffeine combinations, and/or opioids are used by physicians for the treatment of acute migraine. Migraine- specific therapies, such as triptans or ergot alkaloids, 
have become the treatment of choice when patients respond poorly to NSAIDs or 
combination regimens of aspirin and caffeine. For most migraine sufferers, triptans are the 
drug class of choice both from efficacy and tolerability perspecti ves.
8  
Sumatriptan, a 5 -hydroxy- tryptam ine (5- HT) 1B/1D receptor agonist  developed by 
GlaxoSmithKline,  is marketed under the brand name of Imitrex®. Sumatriptan is one of the 
most commonly used triptans for the treatment of acute migraine headache. Oral, intranasal, 
and subcutaneous injectable formulations of sumatriptan are approved by the US Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA) and are available on the market . The relative bioavailability for 
Imitrex  following subcutaneous administration is significantly higher compared to intranasal 
or oral administration .9-11 The therapeutic response rate at 2 hours is dependent upon the 
mode of administration— subcutaneous 70%, oral 59%, and intranasal 61% .12  
The onset of action with subcutaneous sumatriptan (10 minutes) is faster than with 
intranasal (30 to 
45 minutes) or oral (45 to 60 minutes) delivery .9,10,13,14 The intranasal route 
of delivery for sumatriptan can be preferable compared to the oral or subcutaneous routes 
due to the slow rate of absorption of the oral form and invasiveness of self -injection. 
However, even with sumatriptan nasal spray, the issue of a relatively slow rate of absorption and lower bioavailability remains .

 Dr. Reddy’s has developed a nasal formulation of DFN -02 composed of sumatriptan and 
 a permeation enhancer. The safety and 
effectiveness of sumatriptan have been well established.9,10  is a permeation- enhancing 
excipient that belongs to a class of nonionic surfactants  classified as alkylglycosides , which 
consists of alkyl chains of various lengths  linked to a sugar moiety, have been studied for 
their ability to promote increased bioavailability  of drugs via the nasal, oral, and ocular 
routes .15 The mechanisms by which alkylglycosides exert  their permeation- enhancing effects 
on the nasal epithelium in vivo are unclear. The permeation enhancement properties of   
have been characterized for several therapeutic compounds in development and have been 
discussed in a number of journal publications15-21 (  drug master file , reference data  on 
file). 
 
  
 
  
 
 
One 
pivotal Phase 1 study (DFP- 02-CD-009)26 and four pilot Phase 1 studies 
(DFP -02-CD-008,22 2419/11,23 1931/09 ,24 and 2010/1025) have been conducted in a total of 
154 healthy adult male and female volunteers at a dose range of 5 mg to 20 mg. DFN -02 
was generally well -tolerated without any clinically meaningful changes in laboratory 
parameters or vital signs.  
Overall, the pharmacokinetic ( PK) data suggest t hat sumatriptan achieved peak plasma 
concent ration rapidly at approximately 10 minutes following 10 mg DFP -02 intranasal spray, 
approximately 5 minutes sooner than that of the 4 mg and 6 mg Imitrex injections . This 
profile may lead to improved onset of therapeutic benefit for patients  suffering from  migraine 
headaches.  
In addition, in one Phase 3 open -label clinical sa fety study (DFP -02-CD-010),27 167 patients 
used DFN- 02 (studied as DFP- 02) to treat migraine attacks for up to 6 months. Overall, 
4 patients experienced 5 serious adverse events ( SAEs ). Three of the SAEs  were 
treatment -emergent (one subject each; diverticulitis, pyelonephritis and menometrorrhagia) , 
and all 5 SAEs were considered by the Investigator to be not related to study medication.  No 
new safety results were noted; the study results are currently being summarized and will be 
reported in the next version of the Investigator’s Brochure.  
In summary, DFN- 02 is being developed f or the treatment of acute migraine headaches with 
and without aura.  Nonclinical and clinical studies to date have demonstrated acceptable 
tolerability, as well as a favorable PK profile, to allow further characterization in terms of 
safety tolerability and efficacy.

6 Investigational Plan 
6.1 Overall Study Design and Plan  
This is a randomized, 2 DB treatment period dosing study, to be conducted at multiple 
centers in the US. Previously diagnosed patients with a history of episodic migraine ( as 
defined by International Classification of Headache Disorders, 3rd edition [beta version]1 
[ICHD-3] ), who experience an average of 2 to 8 migraine attacks per month for at least the 
past 12 months, with no more than 14 headache days per month, and with 48 hours of 
headache- free tim e between migraine, will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio in both DB periods  to 
receive either  DFN- 02 (sumatriptan nasal spray ) 10 mg or a matching placebo.  
There will be a screening period to evaluate whether the patient fit s the migraine inclusion 
criteria pursuant to ICHD- 3, and does  not have medication overuse.  Patients with at least a 
12-month medical history of acute migraine will be eligible for enrollment in the treatment 
period. Patients will continue to take their normal migraine medication during thi s screening 
period.  
During the screening period, the electronic diary ( eDiary ) will be dispensed in order for the 
patient to enter information for daily check -in, record at least 1 migraine attack , and rescue 
medication use, to determine the patient’s ability to properly use the eDiary . If eligible and 
randomized, patients in the DB1 treatment period will be instructed to use the study 
medication in 1 migraine attack as soon as (and no more than within 1 hour after) 
experiencing  moderate to severe migraine pain (defined as headache pain rating of Grade  2 
[moderate] or Grade 3 [severe] on a pain severity scale of 0 to 3 ). If the patient  is not able to 
use study medication for the first migraine after randomization, they should be instructed to 
use the study medication for the next attack. Those patients who do not experience a 
migraine attack , and/or who do not treat any migraine attack with study medication or record 
eDiary data, will not be allowed to continue into the DB2 treatm ent period, and will be 
discontinued. After treating a migraine attack with study medication, patients should be 
instructed to contact the site within 24 hours of the treated migraine (or the next working day) 
to schedule their next visit.  
Patients will re turn to the s tudy site within 2 to 7 days in the DB1 treatment period and, if 
continuing  to be eligible, will be re -randomized into a DB2 treatment  period to treat 
1 migraine attack at any pain level. They will then return to the study site within 2 to 7 days 
of the second treatment. Once randomized, the total duration of each patient’s participation in the study would be up to 10 weeks.  
If after taking the first dose of study medication a patient does not 
 experience sufficient relief , 
he/she may take a second dose of study medication for the same attack, or take  rescue 
medication more than 2 hours after taking the first dose of study medication, and only after 
completing in the eDiary the 2 hours postdose assessment . If a patient does not experience

 any relief at all from the first dose of study medication after 2 hours, he/she should not take a 
second dose, but may take rescue medication instead, if needed. Rescue medication will be 
decided between the Investigator  and the patient. No more than 2 doses of study medication 
will be taken in a 24- hour period. 
During both DB treatment per iods, data regarding the migraine attack, study medication 
effect and the associated impact on migraine pain, symptoms, function, rescue medication, 
and the patient’s satisfaction will be collected by the patient in real -time in an eDiary . See 
Section 10.2.1.4.1  for eDiary assessment criteria. The eDiary will be reviewed for 
compliance and rescue medication, and data will be entered into the  electronic case report 
form (eCRF). After  study completion or discontinuation, patients should be referred to their 
usual healthcare professional to resume pre- study standard of care, as per the Investigator 
discretion.  
Figure 6-1 Trial Design  
 
6.2 Discussion of Study Design  
The curr
ent study design was chosen to determine the efficacy of  DFN -02 for the treatment 
of acute migraine pain. A screening period will allow sufficient time for screening laboratory 
test results availability and verification that patients meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria.  
Patients will be randomized in a blinded fashion to receive DFN- 02 or placebo and 
self-admi
nister when experiencing a migraine attack to determine whether  DFN- 02 can 
relieve migraine pain, and symptoms and disability  compared with placebo. For the first 
treated acute migraine attack  (DB1 treatment period) , patients will treat moderate or severe 
pain to meet regulatory requirements for efficacy determination; for the second attack  (DB2 
period) , patients  will treat migrain e at any pain level to determine if efficacy is achieved 
throughout the pain level range. Patients are allowed to use a second dose of study medication or take rescue medication more than 2 hours after taking the first dose of study 
medication in the attac k, as described in Section  6.1 and Section 9.5.2 , to opti
 mize patient 
comfort wh
ile support ing clinically relevant data collection. 
7 Selection of Patients and Criteria for Withdrawal

DBP >  90 mmHg ), whether on treatment or not, will be excluded. 
Patients  who had high or uncontrolled BPs in the past  and are  currently controlled with given 
therapies  would be eligible for this study.  
Independent of past history, if a patient  has a sustained resting SBP >  140 mmHg and/or 
DBP > 90 mmHg at Visit 1 (V1) or Visit 2 (V2), those patients should be excluded. Any 
patient without  a known history of hypertension that presents at screening with SBP > 140 
mmHg and/or DBP >  90 mmHg should be excluded if the BP reading is due to suspected 
hypertension or another pathological conditi on, not if due to a transient fluctuation, based on 
the Investigator’s evaluation. If the Investigator believes the BP is falsely elevated, they 
should repeat the assessment 2 to 3 times with the patient in a semi- reclined position in a 
quiet room. Patient s with persistent elevations , despite repeat assessments , should be 
excluded and referred to an appropriate healthcare provider for further assessment .

 7.4 Removal of Patients  from Therapy or Assessments  
Patient s are free to withdraw from the study at any time without providing any reason(s) f or 
withdrawal and without prejudice to further treatment. If a patient is to be withdrawn from the 
study by the Investigator, the Investigator should first alert the Medical  Monitor, if safety 
allows, or as soon as possible thereafter.  
Patient s may be withdrawn from the study  for any of the  following reasons, and the date and 
reason(s) for withdrawal will be documented in the eCRF: 
1. A patient develops any significant illness, or needs to undergo any acute major 
surgery, du
ring the course of the study.  
2. A patient was enrolled and observed to violate any protocol requirement that 
may affect 
the outcome of the study.  
3. A patient withdraws consent.  
4. The Inves
tigator deems it may not be safe or proper for the patient  to continue i n 
the study.  
 A patient who becomes pregnant at any time during the study must be discontinued.  
Patient s prematur 
ely withdrawing from the study after entering the treatment period will be 
encouraged to complete the early termination (V4/ET) evaluations according to this  protocol.  
In the event that a patient  disconti nues prematurely from the study due to a treatment -
emergent adverse event  (TEAE) or serious TEAE, the TEAE or serious T EAE will be 
followed until it resolves (returns to normal or baseline values) or stabilizes, or until it is 
judged by the Investigator to be no longer clinically significant.  
Once a patient  is withdrawn, they may not re -enter the study.  
Reasonable efforts will be made to contact patient s who are lost to follow -up. At a minimum, 
2 attempts by telephone contact and a certified letter should be sent . These attempts to 
contact must be documented in the patient ’s file.  
The Sponsor has the right to terminate the study at any time in the event  of SAEs , or if 
spec
ial circumstances occur relating to the study medication that the Sponsor deems 
unfeasible to continue the study. In this event, the Investigators  will be informed of th e 
reason for study termination.

9 Administration of Study Treatments  
9.1 Method of  Assigning Patient s to Treatment Groups 
The DF N-02-CD-012 study  is a randomized, 2 DB treatment periods , placebo- controlled 
study. Treatment sequences will be assigned randomly in each DB period with a 1:1 ratio to 
receive either DFN -02 or matching placebo ( Figure 6-1). 
9.1.1  Screening (Vis
it 1) 
After written informed consent is obtained and the patient has been confirmed as qualifying 
to 
enter the screening period, the Investigator  or designee will contact the designated 
interactive web response system (IWRS)  to obtain a unique patient  identification (ID) number  
to be used throughout the study . This patient ID number will not be reused for any other 
participant in the study . This unique  identifier  comprises the numerical order of the patients 
screened and will be used to identify the patient  on the eCRF. 
9.1.2  Randomization  (Visit 2)  
Once a pa
tient’s eligibility for enrollment  has been confirmed at the end of the screening 
period, the Investigator (or designee) should contact the IWRS  centralized randomization 
center to receive the patient study medication kit assignment . Patients who do not meet 
eligibility criteria will be registered as screen failures. It is important that the study  staff 
reconfirm the patient’s willingness to continue in the study prior to randomizing the patient to 
a treatment.  
The planned treatment given to individual patients will be determined by a randomization 
scheme prepared by 
the biostatistics group of INC Research. For both DB periods, all 
patients will receive intranasal DFN- 02 10 mg  or a matching placebo  in a randomized 1:1 
treatment sequencing. As detailed in Section 6.1, patients  will treat 1 migr aine attack  in the 
DB1 treatment period and, if eligible, be re -randomized to enter into the DB2 treatment 
period. The IWRS will assign the appropriate study medication kit to each patient  for each 
treatment period. If a patient discontinues from the study after randomization, the patient ID 
number will not be reused, and the patient will not be allowed to re -enter the study.  Patients 
will be required to return unused study medication and t he eDiary  provided by the site.  
9.2 Selection of Doses in the Study  
The human dos
e range of DFP- 02 evaluated in the piv otal study (DFP -02-CD-009)26 and the 
4 pilot studies (DFP -02-CD-008, 2419/11, 1931/09, 2010/10), was based upon doses of the 
marketed intranasal formulations of Imitrex nasal spray .22-25 The concentration of 0  
 was chosen based on early development work (data on file) to optimize the PK profile 
of sumatriptan.  These studies indicated no safety, tolerability, or clinically meaningful 
changes in vital signs and laboratory parameters.  The highest single- dose of sumatriptan in

 DFN- 02 for current and future clinical studies is 10 mg.  The safety and tolerability of this 
dose was evaluated in a long -term safety study (DFP -02-CD-010)27 that showed no new 
safety findings.  
9.3 Selection and Timing of Dose for Each Patient  
At the end of the screening period, eligible patients will be randomized to receive study 
medication (DFN- 02 or
 a matching placebo) as described in Section 6.1. Information about 
use of study medicat
ion, predos e and postdos e assessments , and any rescue medication 
taken during the study will be recorded in the eDiary. For dosing information, see 
Section 8.1.  
9.4 Blinding  
In order to bli
nd the study treatment,  study medication ki ts with identical labeling appearance 
will be assigned unique kit numbers by IWRS and the kits will distributed by  
 to the site  prior to the start of dosing. 
This is a DB study. All ra ndomization data will be kept strictly confidential and accessible 
only to authorized personnel until the time of unblinding after database lock at the end of 
study . Blinding is critical to the integrity of this clinical study; however, in the event of a 
medical emergency for an individual patient, in which knowledge of the treatment assignment is critical to the patient’s management, the blind for the patient may be broken by the Investigator  (or designee)  by contacting IWRS. Before unblinding, the Investigator  (or 
designee)  should have determined that the treatment information is necessary to decide the 
patient’s immediate management, and must make every effort to contact the Medical Monitor 
prior to unblinding. In many cases, especially if the emergency is clearly not related to study 
treatment, the problem may be properly managed without unblinding by assuming that the patient is receiving active treatment. In cases of accidental unblinding or when the Medical 
Monitor cannot be contacted prior to unblinding, the Medical Monitor should be contacted as 
soon as possible after the breaking of the blind and every attempt to preserve the blind for all 
other study staff should be made .  
9.5 Prior and C oncomitant Therapy 
Inves
tigators should document in the eCRF all prior medications for neurological illnesses 
and conditions that the
 patient  has experienced anytime in the past, and other prior 
medications that were taken within 1 year prior to screening. In addition, all concomitant and 
ongoing medications are to be documented in the eCRF.  (See also Section 7.3 exclusion 
criteria and Sect
ion 9.5.3  prohibited and allowed medications .) 
9.5.1  Medication
 History  
No change in any p
rophylactic migraine medications will be allowed during the study.  
Patient s will be able to continue their prescribed medications for mild, chronic medical 
conditions as lon
g as the doses of these medications have been stabilized for at least 
30 days prior to screening and the medications are not otherwise prohibited or restricted in 
the protocol.  See Section 9.5.3  for prohibited and allowed medications.

 • Monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors : at least 15 days prior to randomization 
• Antipsychotics: at least 15 days  prior to randomization (if used for non- psychiatric 
conditions, should be evaluated on a case -by-case basis with the Medical Monitor ) 
• Investigational drug (s) or device(s):  at least 30 days prior to randomization, or 3 months 
if associated with central nervous system  
• Participated in a central nervous  system c linical trial: at least 3 months prior to 
randomization 
 
9.5.2  Rescue Medication  
If a patient  does
 not experienc e sufficient relief with the first dose of the study medication, 
he/she may take a second dose of study medication or take rescue medication after 2 hours 
or more after taking the first dose of study medication and only after completing in the eDiary 
the 2 hour s postdose assessments . If a patient  does not experience any relief at all from the 
first dose of study medication after 2 hours, he/she should not take a second dose, but may 
take rescue medication instead, if needed.  
If a patient  gets a mig raine attack, the first dose of the study medication should not be taken 
if the patient  has treated an episodic migraine attack acutely with any other medication within 
the past 48 hours , or if the patient  has used an analgesic for non- migraine pain acutely 
within the past 48 hours.  
The specific rescue medication will initially be decided mutually between the Investigator and the patient  prior 
 to or at V 2, but may be adjusted as needed during the treatment period, with 
the Investigator ensuring that prohibited medications (as listed below) are not assigned and consulting with the Medical Monitor , if needed. Rescue medication will not be provided by 
the Sponsor, and its use should be managed by the patient  and their Investigator. Rescue 
medication related decisions should be detailed in the source documents.  
Rescue medication, including NS
 AIDs or other migraine medications , prescription or 
non-prescription drugs, vitamins, herbal, and dietary supplements (including St John’s Wort) , 
should be taken as described above.  Patients  should not take prohibited medications listed 
in Section 9.5.3  as a rescue medication.  
9.5.3  Prohibited 
and Allowed Med ications  
The following medications should not be taken during the study: 
• MAO inhibitors  
• Triptans (except study medication) and other 5 -HT1 recept or agonists  
• Ergotamine or ergot -type medicati ons 
• Antipsychotics  (for any reas on) 
• Opioids  are prohibited  if  used for ≥ 4 days per month. Additional caution should be 
exercised with use of tramadol. To ensure patient safety in the study, patients should not 
take tramadol and triptan drugs concomitantly due to the risk of serotonin syndrome. If a 
patient has taken study medication, they should not take tramadol for at least 24 hours; if 
a patient has taken tramadol, they should not take study medication for at least 48 hours , 
or for at least 5 half-lives of tramadol, whichever is longer . 
 
SSRIs, SNRIs, tricyclic antidepressants, and steroids for chronic conditions are allowed 
during the study if the dose is stable for at least 3 months prior to randomization and is not

medication or be contraindicated in the Imitrex product label or package insert. 
Patients  will be instructed to refrain from using illicit substances (including marijuana) during 
the study.  Plea
se refer to Section 7.3 for exclusion criteria .  
9.6 Treatment Compliance  
Patient
s will be instructed by the study site staff on the proper administration of study 
medication to ens
ure compliance. Written instructions for use of study medication will be 
distributed to the Investigator sites, and patients should be confirmed to have, or be provided with, the instructions every time study medication is dispensed.  
See Section 6.1 and Section 9.5
 .2 for detai ls on timing of dosing with study medication and 
use of rescue
 medication .  
At the end of the DB1 treatment period (V2),  patients will be required to return all used and 
unused study medication from DB1 before any study medication f or the DB2 treatment 
period will be dispensed. 
At V4 /ET, patients will be required to return all used and unused study medication, study 
medication containers, and completed eDiary . 
10 Study Procedures  
10.1 Duration of Treatment  
The duration of study participation will be up to approximately 13 weeks, including a screening per
iod of approximately 3 weeks ( wherein patients may be randomized earlier 
than 3  weeks provided they meet inclusion/exclusion criteria and  headache assessment 
criteria; the screening period may also be  extended  beyond 3 weeks based on Investigator 
judgment and in consultation with the Medical Monitor), 2 DB treatment periods with up to 
4 weeks (each period) for patients to experience and treat migraine attack s, and 2 to 7 days 
for patients to return to the site after treatment. The combined  2 DB treatment periods would 
total up to 10 weeks. Migraine attacks and associated treatment and assessments will be 
recorded in an eDiary  (see Section 10.2.1.4.1 ). 
10.1.1  Data Recording U sing eDiary  
Th
e daily eDiar y will be us ed to record migraine attack assessment data in real -time by 
patients  as described in Section 6.1 and Section 10.2.1.4.1 , and as  shown i n Table 10-2 . I t is 
compulsory f
or all patients to check -in the eDiary every day during the entire study period to 
ensure presence and functionality. If a patient does not check -in consistently or if he/she 
does not report a migraine attack in the eDiary for 2 to 3 weeks, it is recommended that they 
should be contacted by study staff to check if the patient  has technical difficulties or confirm 
they have not experienced a migraine.

2 Patients who do not complete both DB periods will complete an ET visit.  
3 Patients may be randomized earlier than 21 days during this period if they meet inclusion/exclusion criteria and headache assessment criteria. The screening period may 
also be extended based on Investigator judgment and in consultation with the Medical Mo nitor. 
4 Prior to eDiary dispensing, initial screening should determine to the extent possible that the patient may be eligible for the study and is able, willing, and understands after 
being instructed how to use the eDiary. The eDiary will be dispensed once , and information for a t least 1 migraine attack should be entered if the patient is randomized; 
the eDiary should continue to be used throughout the DB periods. At V2 and V3, randomized patients will be re- instructed on the eDiary to ensure real -time entry of 
predose a nd postdos e assessments and the level of migraine pain to treat Grade 2 [moderate] or Grade 3 [severe] for DB1 treatment period, and any  pain level for the 
DB2 treatment period.  
5 At screening (V1), complete physical examination will be performed and recorded in the source document that includes examination of head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat 
[HEENT], heart, lungs, a bdomen, skin, cervical and axillary lymph nodes, neurological, and musculoskeletal systems. At all subsequent visits, symptom -driven limited 
physical examination will be performed and recorded.  Any subsequent untoward change during the study will be recorded as an AE.  
6 Weight only.  
7 At screening, patients with a history of hypertension that is uncontrolled (i.e., SBP > 140 mmHg and/or DBP > 90 mmHg), whether on treatment or not, will be excluded. 
Patients who had high or uncontrolled BPs in the past and are currently controlled with given therapies would be eligible for this study. Independent of past history, if a 
patient has a sustained resting SBP > 140 mmHg and/or DBP > 90 mmHg at V1 or V2, they should be excluded. Any patient without  a known history of hypertension that 
presents at screening with SBP > 140 mmHg and/or DBP > 90 mmHg should be excluded if the BP reading is due to suspected hypertension or another pathological 
condition, not if due to a transient fluctuation, based on the Investigator’s evaluation. If the Investigator believes the BP is falsely elevated, they should repeat the 
assessment 2 to 3 times with the patient in a s emi-reclined position in a quiet room. Patients with persistent elevations, despite repeat assessments, should be excl uded 
and referred to an appropriate healthcare provider for further assessment.  
8 Serum pregnancy test will be performed at screening (V1) for all female patients  of childbearing potential  (or at any other time during the study if needed to confirm a 
susp ected pregnancy from a positive urine pregnancy test). 
9 Urine pregnancy tests will be performed at all study visits after screening for  all female  patient s of childbearing potential . 
10 Patients will be instructed by the study site staff on the proper administration of study medication to ensure compliance. Written instructions for use of the study 
medication will be distributed to Investigator sites, and patients should be confirmed to have, or be provided with, the instructions every time study medication is 
dispensed.  
11 Unused study medication, including empty study medication containers, should be returned by patients. Unused study medication should not be redispensed.  
12 When the patient experiences a migraine episode, they should contact the site within 24 hours  of treating with study medication to schedule their next visit. The eDiary 
will be used to record all migraine attacks treated with study medication during the study period.  
13 Screening eDiary information will be kept in the source document . It is compulsory for all the patients to check -in the eDiary every day during the entire study period. If a 
patient does not check- in consistently or does not report a migraine attack in the eDiary for 2 to 3 weeks, it is recommended they should be cont acted by study staff to 
check if the patient has technical difficulties or confirm they have not experienced a migraine.  
14 Arrangements should be made by the site for a timely return of the eDiary device for patients who screen fail.

CONFIDENTIAL  10.2.1.4.1  eDiary Assessments  
Patient s will be provided with an eDiary at s creening (V1) to collect at least 1 migraine 
episode data and, if randomized (V2), to continue to collect migraine date and time (for 
migraine attacks treated with study medication) and any non- study medication used to 
treat migraine in the study. At V2 and V3, patients will be re- instructed on the eDiary 
usage to ensure real -time entry of predose  and postdose recordings. (Predos e 
migraine assessments will be allowed to be recorded retrospectively in the event a 
patient  did not follow the instructions .) All patient s should be instructed to return the 
eDiary to the study site.  
At baseline (V2), patient s wil l complete the PPMQ -R questionnaire in the eDiary ; 
record the migraine pain start and end (date and time) when they get the migraine; 
record the baseline pain level ; record the functional disability  scale ; and record 
presence of symptoms and MBS (among nausea, photophobia, and p honophobia)  just 
before taking the study medication.  
At postdose, patient s will  record time to meaningful pain relief (based on their 
perception) , and time to pain- free after study medication within 2 hours postdose. 
Patient s will also record their  functional disability at 2 hours and 24 hours postdose, 
and their pain level and presence of MBS at 10, 15, 20, 30  minutes, and at 1, 1.5,  2, 
and 24 hours postdose. Patient s will record their  treatment satisfaction at 2 hours 
postdose, and complete the PPMQ -R questionnaire again at 24 hours postdose. 
Patient s will also record study medication dosing and use of rescue medication in the 
eDiary  at applicable timings.  
The following eDiary assessments will be recorded by the patient in accordance with 
Table 10.2.  
• Migraine 
pain and symptoms: 
o Migraine pain start and end (date and time) 
o Level of headache pain predose and at various time points after  (0 = none; 
1 = mild; 2 = moderate; 3 = severe)  
o Time t o meaningful pain relief (based on patient ’s percepti on) and time to 
pain- free after study medication 
o Migraine symptoms and MBS other than pain (nausea, photophobia, 
phonophobia, at predose,
 and at various time points, postdose)  
o  
• PPMQ -R: The PPMQ -R is a self -adm inistered satisfaction measurement for 
acute migraine treatment.   
• Functional disability scale (0 = no disability, able to function normally; 
1 = performance 
of daily activities mildly impaired, can still do everything but 
with difficulty; 2 = performance of daily activities moderately impaired, unable to 
do some things; 3 = performance of daily activities severely impaired, cannot do all or most things, bed rest may be necessary ).  
• Overall treatment satisfaction, measured by ask
 ing questions to the patient s, and 
the answer s will be assessed on a 7- point scale (1 = very satisfied, 2 = satisfied, 
3 = somewhat satisfied, 4 = neither satisfied nor dissatisfied, 5 = somewhat 
dissatisfied, 6 = dissatisfied, and 7 = very dissatisfied).  
• Study medication and rescue use. 
Visits may
 be scheduled as needed for AE management. Adverse event and 
concomitant medi
cation review should be performed at each unscheduled visit.

CONFIDENTIAL  10.2.2  Efficacy  Assessments  
All efficacy data will be collected in the eDiary. The efficacy assessments are shown in 
Section 10.2.1
.4.1 and Section 11.4. 
The pri
mary efficacy endpoint  is the proportion of  patients who are pain- free (defined 
as a reduction from predose moderate [Grade 2] or severe [Grade 3] pain to none 
[Grade 0]) at 2 hours after the first  dose of study medication compared between 
DFN- 02 and placebo.  
Secondary and exploratory ef ficacy endpoints  are listed in Section 11.4.2  and Section 
11.4.3 , respec
tively.  
10.2.3  Safety Assessments  
Safety assessment s, performed according to the schedule of assessments,  include the 
following:  
• Physical examination 
• Serum/ urine pregnancy  test in female patients of childbearing potential  
• Clinical laboratory evaluations ( hematology , clin ical chemistry, and urinalysis ) 
• Vital signs measurement (sitting SBP/DBP, pulse rate, and body temperature)  
• Recording of 12-lead ECG s 
• AEs  
• Concom
itant medication review  (including con firmation and recording of 
medications entered into the eDiary in the eCRF) 
 
Any protocol -specified safet y assessment may be repeated or conducted unscheduled 
as necessary to ensure patient safety.  
10.2.3.1  Physical Examination  
A complete phy
sical examination will be performed at screening (V1) by the 
Investigator ,
 or medically qualified designee,  and will includ e examination of the head, 
eyes, ears, nose, and throat [HEENT], heart, lungs, abdomen, skin, cervical and 
axillary lymph nodes, neurological, and musculoskeletal systems. All findings will be 
kept in the source  document . At all subsequent visits, symptom -driven limited physical 
examination will be performed and recorded . Any subsequent untoward change during 
the study will be recorded as an AE. In addition, medical history will be recorded at 
screening, including smoking history, if applicable.  
10.2.3.2  Pregnancy 
All female patients of childbearing potential will be required to undergo a serum 
pregnancy tes
t (hCG) at screening (V1), and a urine pregnancy test (beta hCG) at all 
subsequent study visits . All patients confirmed to be pregnant at any time during the 
study should be immediately discontinued. Patients of childbearing potential will be 
required to use an acceptable form of birth control from screening through the end of participation in the study. Although pregnancy is not an SAE, the procedures to report 
pregnancies will be the same as the procedures detailed for reporting SAEs ( Section 
10.2.3.7). Any pregnancy that occurs in a female patient (or female partner of a male patient) during
 the study, or within 30 days after taking the last dose of study 
medication, should be reported to  Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories as described in Section 
10.2.3.7. Pregnancies will be followed to the end of the pregnancy, whether successful

Pregnancy test: Serum pregnancy test will be performed on all female patien ts of childbearing potential at 
screening visit (or at any other time during the study if needed to confirm a suspected pregnancy  after a 
positive urine pregnancy test ). A urine  pregnancy test will be performed onsite at other time points for all 
female  patient s of childbearing potential .  
Hematology  (including HbA1c), clinical chemistry , and urinalysis  may be repeated during the study as 
needed to evaluate a patient’s condition. Tests not specified in the protocol may be allowed after 
discussion with t he Sponsor’s Medical Monitor  or de signee . 
 
Hematology  (including HbA1c ), TSH, clinical chemistry, urinalysis, laboratory, urine

CONFIDENTIAL  Blood pressure measurements are to be taken in the same arm for the duration of the 
study. Body weight (without shoes) will be recorded at screening and V 4/ET, and 
height (without shoes) will be recorded at screening only.  
Start and stop dates of last menstrual cycle for  all females o f childbearing potential will 
be recorded at screening and at each study visit.  
Vital sign measurements will be repeated if clinically significant per the Investigator’s judgment or
 if machine/equipment errors occur. Out -of-range blood pressure, pulse 
rate, and body temperature measurements will be repeated at the Investigator’s discretion. Any confirmed clinically significant vital sign measurement in the 
Investigator’s opinion must be recorded as medical history or an AE, as applicable.   
10.2.3.5  Twelve -Lead Electrocardi
 ogram  
A 12-lead resting ECG will be performed at screening (V1), and at every study visit. 
Each  ECG will be reviewed by the Investigator.  Tracings will be printed, signed, and 
dated by the Investigator and kept in the patient’s file. The overall interpretation and 
determination of the clinical relevance of ECG findings will be the responsibility of the 
Investigator and will be recorded in the patient’s eCRF.  
10.2.3.6  Adverse Events  
Adverse Event D efinition 
A
n AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study patient  
administered
 a study medication and which does not necessarily have a causal 
relationship with this treatment.  A TEAE is an AE  with a start date on or after the initial 
dose of study medication and up to 5 days after the last dose of study medication. An 
AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of the 
study medication , whether or not related to the study  medication. This includes an 
exacerbation of pre -existing conditions or events, intercurrent illnesses, drug 
interaction , or the significant worsening of the indication under investigation that is not 
recorded elsewhere in the eCRF . Anticipated fluctuations of pre -existing conditions, 
including the disease under study , that do not represent a clinically significant 
exacerbation or worsening need not be considered AEs . Migraine headaches will not 
be captured as AEs.  Migraine headaches will be captured by the patient in the eDiary  
provided to them .  
For the purpose of the site’s data col lection responsibilities, any untoward event that 
started or worsened after the informed consent form (ICF) was signed  until the final 
end-of-study visit (inclusive)  is to be considered an AE.  
It is the responsibility of the Investigator  to document all AEs that occur during the 
study.  Adverse events  will be elicited by asking the patient  a non -leading question, for 
example, “Have you experienced any new or changed symptoms since we last asked/since your last visit?”  Adverse events  should be reported on the appropriate 
page of the eCRF .

CONFIDENTIAL  Assessment of Severity 
Each AE will be assigned a category by the Investigator  as follows:  
Mild An 
AE that is easily tolerated by the patient , causes minim al 
discomfort , and does not interfere with everyday activities.  
Moderate An AE that is sufficiently discomforting to interfere with normal 
everyday acti
vities; intervention may be needed.  
Severe An AE that prevents normal everyday activities; treatment or other 
intervention usual
ly needed.  
If there is a change in severity of an AE, it must be recorded as a separate event. 
Assessment of C ausality 
Every
 effort will be made by the Investigator  t o assess the relationship of the AE, if any, 
to the study medication. Causality should be assessed using the categories presented 
in the following table:  
Not Related  The event is clearly due to extraneous causes (e .g., diseases, 
environment ), which should be s pecif ied if known ; or the event is 
most likely produced by other factors such as the patient ’s clinical 
state, therapeutic interventions , or concomitant therapy and does 
not follow a known response pattern to the study medication.  
Possibl y Related  The event is temporally rel ated to study medication use but can be 
explained by another etiology. Information on the effect of study 
product withdrawal may be lacking.  
Probabl y Related  The event is temporally related to study medication use and is 
consistent with known effects of the study medication and/or improves upon withdrawal of the study medication.  
Definitely Related  The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of 
study medication administration and/or follows a known response pattern to the study medicati on and could not have been produced 
by other factors such as the patient ’s clinical state, therapeutic 
intervention, or concomitant therapy and either occurs immediately 
following study medication administration or improves on stopping 
the medication or th ere is a positive reaction at the application site.  
Action Taken  
The Investigator  will report  the act ion taken in the appropriate section of the eCRF , as 
follows:  
• Dose not changed  
• Drug interrupted  
• Drug withdrawn  
• Not applicable 
• Unknown 
Follow -up of Adverse Events

CONFIDENTIAL  have ongoing AEs at the time of study completion or ET should be followed up for 
30 days  after receiving the last dose of study medication or until the event s resolve, are 
stabilized, or determined to be chronic, whichever occurs first.  
Documentation and Reporting of Adverse Event s 
Adverse events  will be reported and documented in accordance with the procedures 
outlined in this section . Adverse event s will be reported from the time of informed 
consent  through V4/ET and documented on the r elevant eCRF  pages.  The following 
data should be documented for each AE: 
• Description of the symptom event  
• Classificat
ion of “serious” or “not serious ” 
• Severity  
• Dat
e of first occurrence and date of resolution (if applicabl e) 
• Action taken  
• Causal relationship 
• Outcome of event (unknown, recovered, not yet recovered, recovered with 
sequelae, death 
[with date and cause reported]).  
10.2.3.7  Serious Adverse Events 
Serious Adverse Event Def
inition  
An S
AE is any untoward medical occurrence or effect that, at any  dose:  
• Results  in death.  
• Is li
fe-threatening . An AE is li fe-threatening if the patient  is at immediate risk of 
death from the event as it occurs (i.e., it does not include a reaction that might 
have caused death if it had occurred in a more serious form) . 
• Requires or prolongs i npatient hospitaliz ation. C omplicat ions occurring during 
hospitaliz ation are AEs and are SAEs if they cause prolongation of the current 
hospitalization.  Hospitaliz ation for elective treatment of a pre -existing 
non-worsening condition is not, however, considered an AE.  The details of such 
hospitaliz ations must be recorded on the medical history or physical examination 
page of the eCRF . 
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity . An AE is incapac itating or 
disabling if it results in a substantial or permanent disruption of the patient ’s ability 
to carry out normal life functions. 
• Is a c ongenital anom aly/birth defect. 
In addition, medical and scientific judgment  is required to  decide if prompt notification is 
required in situations other  than those defined for SAEs above (i.e. , any event that the 
Investigator  regards as serious that did not strictly meet the criteria above but that may 
have jeopardiz ed the patient  or required intervention to prevent one of the outcomes 
listed above, or that would suggest any significant hazard, contraindication, side effect , 
or precaution that may be associated with the use of the study medication ). 
Reporting of S erious Adverse Events 
Patient
s should report all SAEs that occur during the clinical study, or within 30 days of 
receiving the
 last dose of study medication, to the Investigator . It is the responsibility of 
the Investigator  to follow the procedures  described below,  whether or not the SAE is 
considered to be related to the study medication.

CONFIDENTIAL  At the first occurrence of an SAE, the Investigator  should complete an SAE report and 
notify the Sponsor  within 24 hou rs of occurrence of the SAE. An SAE report consists of 
the SAE form, the concomitant medication form, and any available supporting 
documentation (e.g. , hospital discharge summary). A copy of the SAE form must be 
emailed within 24 hours  to the attention of Dr.  at: 
Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories  Inc. 
 
 
 
 
Th
e Invest
igato
r should not wait to receive additional information to fully document the 
event before notification of an SAE, though additional information may be requested.  
Where applicable, information from relevant laboratory results, hospital case records , 
and autopsy reports should be obtained.  
Instances of death, congenital abnormality , or an event that is  of sufficient clinical 
concern to influence the overall assessment of s afety, if brought to the attention of the 
Investigator  at any time after cessation of study medication administration and linked 
by the Investigator  to this study, should be reported to the study Medical Monitor .  
The Sponsor and/or INC Research will prom ptly notify all relevant parties of findings 
that could adversely affect the safety of patients, influence patients’ desire to continue 
in the study, impact the conduct of the study, or alter the Institutional Review Board 
(IRB) approval of the study. In addition, INC  Research, on behalf of the Sponsor, will 
expedite the reporting to all concerned Investigators and to the IRB (where required) of 
all adverse reactions that are both serious and unexpected. The Sponsor will  expedite 
the reporting of all adverse reactions that are both serious and unexpected and for which there is a reasonable possibility of their being caused by the study medication, to 
the regulatory authorities as soon as possible but in no case later than 15 calendar days after becoming aware of their occurrence through an IND Safety Report 21 CFR 
320.31(d)(3).  
If the AE is fatal or life -threatening, and w
 ith reasonable possibility of its being related 
to the study medication, the Sponsor must also notify the FDA as soon as possible, but 
in no case later than 7 calendar days after becoming aware of its occurrence, by 
telephone or fax pursuant to 21 CFR 320.31(d)(3).  
If the patient  took one or more sus pect medicinal product(s) other than the study 
medication, the relevant manufacturer(s) of this medicinal product(s) will be informed 
about the SAE by the Sponsor if the Investigator assesses there is a reasonable 
possibility the concomitant drug caused the SAE. The Investigator must provide their causality assessment for any concomitant medication taken by the patien t. 
Follow -up of Adverse Events 
All follow -up reports 
will be subject to the same reporting timelines as the Initial 
Reports. Within 24 hours of receipt of new information, the updated follow -up SAE 
form, along with any supporting documentation (e.g., patient discharge summary or 
autopsy reports), should be faxed or emailed to the Sponsor.  
The Sponsor must be notified within 5 days if any patient is wit hdrawn or discontinued 
study medication use due to an AE.

of the study medication received would affect the treatment of the 
emergency). For a medical emergency, the blind must only be broken following 
discussion on a case- by-case basis, at the discretion of the Investigator/treating 
physician/Sponsor.  
If the blind is broken, the date, time, and reason must be recorded in the patient ’s 
source rec
ord, eCRF, and any associated AE report.  
If an Investigator, site personnel performing assessments, or patient  is unblinded, the 
unbl
inding incident and unblinded patient  must be listed as a major protocol deviation.  
A patient  for whom the blind is broken will discontinue study medication and be 
scheduled for
 a safety follow -up visit and then discontinued from the study. The patient  
will be encouraged to stay in the study until the AE is resolved or stabilized.  
For all SAEs observed in the study considered to be drug related ,  a suspected 
unexpected serious adverse reaction (SUSAR) will be reported by the Sponsor to the 
FDA as an unblinded IND Safety Report. All Investigators and the IRB will receive 
blinded reports. However, on the request of the IRB, the Sponsor will send unblinded 
reports directly to the IRB.  
Laboratory and Vital Signs Variables  
Vital signs and laboratory abnormalities should be reported as AEs if they are 
considered to be 
clinically significant, as per the Investigator’s judgment. If an abnormal 
laboratory value is associated with clinical signs and symptoms, the sign/symptom 
should be reported as an AE , and the associated abnormal laboratory result should be 
considered additional information.  
Pregnancy  
Although pregnancy is not an SAE, the procedures to report pregnancies will be the 
same as the p
rocedures detailed above for reporting SAEs.  
Female patient s should not be pregnant when entering the study and must not become 
pregnant during the study; please see Section 10.2.3.2  for additional details. Following

CONFIDENTIAL  administration of study medication, any known cases of pregnancy in female patient s 
or male patient s who impregnate their female partners will be reported to the Sponsor 
within 24 hours of occurrence. All female patie nts will be withdrawn from the study and 
administration of study medication will be stopped. The pregnancy will be reported 
immediately by phone and by faxing/emailing a completed Pregnancy Report to the 
Sponsor (or designee) within 24 hours of knowledge of the event. The pregnancy will not be processed as an SAE; however , the Investigator will follow the patient  until 
completion of the pregnancy and must assess the outcome in the shortest possible time but not more than 30 days after completion of the preg nancy. The Investigator 
should notify the Sponsor (or designee) of the pregnancy outcome by submitting a follow -up Pregnancy Report. If the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for 
immediate classification of an SAE (e.g., spontaneous or therapeutic abortion [any 
congenital anomaly detected in an aborted fetus is to be documented], stillbirth, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly), the Investigator will report the event by phone 
and by faxing a completed SAE form to the Sponsor (or designee) within 24 hours of 
knowledge of the event.  
Overdose 
The Investigator must notify the Sponsor of any occurrence of overdose with study 
medication wit
hin 24 hours of becoming aware of the overdose. More than 4 doses 
within 2 hours will be considered as an overdose for this study. In the event an overdose leads to an SAE, it will be reported to the regulatory board, and medical 
management will be done by the Investigator  on a case- by-case basis.  
No gross overdoses in clinical practice have been reported. Coronary vasospasm was 
observed after 
intravenous administration of Imitrex Injection. Overdoses would be 
expected from animal data (dogs at 0.1 g/kg, rats at 2 g/kg) to possibly cause 
convulsions, tremor, inactivity, erythema of the extremities, reduced respiratory rate, cyanosis, ataxia, mydriasis, and paralysis. The elimination half -life of sumatriptan is 
about 2 hours, therefore , monitoring of patients after overdose should continue for at 
least 10 hours or while symptoms or signs persist. It is unknown what effect 
hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis has on the serum concentrations of sumatriptan.

10.2.3.8  Unexpected Adverse Reactions  
Unexpected Adverse React
ion Definition  
An unexpected adverse reaction is any untoward and unintended response that is 
related to the ad
ministration of a  study medication  at any dose that is not consistent 
with the applicable product information (e.g., In vestigator’s B rochure for an 
unauthorized study medication or summary of product characteristics for an authori zed 
product).  
All SUSARs will be subject to expedited reporting.  The Sponsor  and/or INC Resear ch 
shall ensure that all relevant information about a SUSAR that is fatal or life- threatening 
is reported to the relevant competent authorities and the IRB within 7 days after 
knowledge by the Sponsor  of such a case and that relevant follow -up information is 
comm unicated within an additional 8 days.  All other SUSARs will be reported to the 
FDA and the IRB  within 15 days after knowledge by the Sponsor  of such case s. The 
Investigator  should follow up on each SUSAR until the event is resolved or until, in the 
opinion of the Investigator, the event is stabili zed or determined to be chronic.  
Post-study SUSARs that occur within 30 days after the patient  has completed the 
clinical study must be reported by the Investigator  to the Sponsor .

CONFIDENTIAL  Warnings and Precautions  
The following warnings and precautions  have been issued for s umatriptan : 
Sumatriptan should not be given to patients with documented ischemic or vasospastic 
CAD. It i
s strongly recommended that sumatriptan  not be given to patients in whom 
unrecognized CAD is predicted by the presence of risk factors (e.g., hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, smoker, obesity, diabetes, strong family history of CAD, female with surgical or physiological menopause, male over 40 years of age) unless a 
cardiovascular evaluation provides satisfactory clinical evidence that the patient is 
reasonably free of CAD and ischemic myocardial disease or other significant 
underlying cardiovascular disease. If, during the cardiovascular evaluation, the 
patient’s medical history or ECG investigations reveal findings indicative of, or consistent with, coronary artery vasospasm or myocardial ischemia, sumatriptan 
should not be administered.  For further details, please refer to the full Imitrex product 
insert.  
10.2.4  Appropriateness of M easurements

details will be provided in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP), which will be finalized before database lock  and unblinding of the data. 
In general, descriptive statistical methods will be used to sum marize the d
 ata from this 
study , with hypothesis testing performed for the primary and all secondary  efficacy 
endpoints . Unless stated otherwise, the term “descriptive statistics” refers to number of 
patient s (n), mean,  median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum for continuous 
data and frequencies and percentages for categorical data. The term “treatment group” 
refers to treatment assignment: DFN- 02 10 mg or placebo. All data collected during the 
study will be included in patient  data listings. Unless otherwise noted, the data will be 
sorted first by treatment assignment, patient  number , and then by date within each 
patient  number.  
All statistical analyses are described in Section 11.6. Unless specified otherwise, all 
statistic
al testing and  confidence intervals will be 2- sided and will be performed using a 
significance (alpha) level of 0.05.  
All statistical analyses will be conducted with the SAS® software package version 9.3 or 
higher.  
11.1 Statistical Analysis  Plan 
A S
AP will be created and approved prior to database lock. This document will provide 
further detail
s regarding the definition of analysis variables and analysis methodology 
to address all study objectives . The SAP will serve as a compliment to the protocol and 
supersedes it in case of differences.

11.6.1  Primary Eff
icacy Analysi s 
Efficacy analysis for primary, secondary, and exploratory endpoints will be based on 
the FAS population.  
The pr
imary efficacy endpoint , the proportion o f patients who are free from headache 
pain at 2 hours after the first dose of study medication taken for a migraine attack with 
moderate to severe  headache pain during the DB1 treatment period, will be analyzed 
using Fisher’ s exact test. The response rate will be calculated as the number of 
patients who are pain- free at 2 hours postdose divided by the number of patients with 
non-missing assessment at 2 hours postdose. The number of patients with non-missing 
assessment, the number of patients with response, the response rate, and the p- value 
for comparing DFN -02 10 mg v ersus  placebo will be presented.  
Analysis  will be performed using the  last obse rvation carried forward ( LOCF ) and 
observed data in the FAS population and PP population.  
Additional sensitivity analyses and data handling rules for missing data of the primary  
endpoint will be docum
ented in detail in the SAP.

CONFIDENTIAL  11.6.2  Secondary Efficacy Analysis  
The secondary endpoints for proportion of patients who are free from headache pain, 
for proporti
on of patients with their MBS  absent, for proportion of patients who are free 
from nausea, photophobia, and phonophobia, for proportion of patients who have pai n 
relief , for p roportion of patients  who have sustained pain freedom, and for proportion of 
patients  who use a second dose of the study medication or rescue medication, will be 
analyzed using Fisher’s exact test similarly to the described analysis for the primary 
endpoint.  
The secondary endpoints for time to m eaningful pain relief  and time to pain freedom  
will be analyzed using Kaplan- Meier product -limit method.  
The secondary endpoints for the change in f unctional disability score at 2 hours and 
24 hours after the first dose of study medication will be analyzed using Wilcoxon 
signed- rank test. The secondary endpoints for treatment satisfaction at 2 hours 
postdose as measured on the 7- point scale, and at 24 hours postdose as measured by 
the PPMQ -R, will be analyzed using the Wilcoxon rank -sum test.

6.4 Subgr
oup Analysis  
Subgroup analyses 
of the efficacy data will be perf ormed as needed and details to be 
documented in the SAP. All subgroup analyses will be exploratory.  
11.6.5  Additional Efficacy A nalyses  
Additional ef
ficacy analyses will be performed on the PP population. Further stati stical 
details and possible other analyses will be provided in the SAP.  
11.6.6  Safety Analysis  
All AEs w
ill be coded using the latest version of the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory 
Activities (MedDR
A) version 19.0 or higher. A TEAE is an AE with a start date on or 
after the initial dose of study medication and up to 5 days after the last dose of study 
medication. Only TEAEs will be included in summary tables. Migraine headaches will 
not be captured as AEs. Migraine headaches will be captured by the patient in the 
eDiary provided to them  at screening. The information will then be entered into the 
appropriate eCRF page. 
The incidence of all TEAEs will be tabulated by treatment received. These TEAEs will 
be classified by 
system organ class ( SOC ) and preferred term ( PT). For incidence 
reporting, if a patient reported more than one AE that was coded to the same SOC or PT, the patient will be counted only once for that specific SOC or PT.  
An overview of AEs, which includes patient incidence of TEAEs, headache or 
migraine- related 
TEAEs, study medication- related TEAEs, and SAEs, will be 
presented. The patient incidence of TEAEs, headache- or migraine -related TEAEs, 
study medication -related TEAEs, and SAEs will be summarized by SOC and PT.

CONFIDENTIAL  Treatment -emergent adverse events will also be summarized in a table by severity. For 
TEAEs presented by severity, the worst severity during the study  will be presented for 
each patient, SOC, and PT.  
Treatment -emergent advers e events will also be summarized in a table by relationship 
to study medication. For TEAEs presented by relationship to study medication, the 
strongest relationship to study medication during the study  will be presented for each 
patient, SOC, and PT.  
All AEs will also be presented in a by -patient data list ing.  
All prior and concomitant medications will be classified using the Anatomical 
Therapeutic Che
mical (ATC) classification and preferred drug names from the World 
Health Organization Drug Dictionary (WHO -DD), version March 2016 or later. 
Medications will be considered concomitant if they were taken at any time between the 
date of first dose and the date of last dose of study medication, inclusive. Medications 
will be considered as prior if stopped before the date of first dose of study medication 
during the DB1 treatmen t period. 
Prior and concomitant medications will be summarized in separate tables  b y ATC level 
2 and preferred drug name for the safety population. 
One combined listing w ill be provided for prior and concomitant medications. An 
identifier will be provided to show if a medication is prior or concomitant.  
Electrocardiograms, clinical laboratory data, and vital signs measurements will be 
summarized by
 treatment group and time point along with the change from baseline 
(V2). All ECG data, clinical laboratory data, vital signs, physical examinations, study medication use, and concomitant medication use will also be presented in by -patient 
data listings. 
11.7 Interim Analyses  
No interim anal
ysis is planned.  
11.8 Determination of Sample Size 
One hundr
ed patients will be rando mized for the DB 1 treatment period. Patients who 
discontinue participation without completing the study protocol will not be replaced.  
The primary endpoint is the comparison of the proportion of patient s who are pain- free 
at
 2 hours after the first dose of study medication. It is assumed that 15% of placebo 
and 42% of DFN -02 (treated) patient s will be pain- free at 2 hours. A sample size of 
50 patient s in each DB1 dosing arm  will provide 81% power to detect this assumed  
difference between placebo and DFN -02 at a 5% (2- sided) level of significance.  
12 Quality Assurance and Quality Control  
12.1.1  Audit and Inspection  
The s tudy site and study docum entation may be subjec t to quality a ssurance audit 
during the course of the study by t he Sponsor , INC Research , or its nominated

CONFIDENTIAL  12.1.2  Monitoring  
Source documents for this study include the eDiary  and study files stored at the site. 
Electronic  CRF d ata collection must be completed for each patient  who signs an ICF. 
In accordance with cGCP and International Conference on Harmonisation ( ICH) 
guidelines,
 the study monitor will carry out source document verification at regular 
intervals to ensure that the data collected in the eCRF  are accurate and reliable.  The 
frequency of monitoring visits will be determined by the rate of patient  recruitment.  
The following will be reviewed, at a minimum,  at these visi ts: 
• Compliance with the protocol  
• Consent procedure  
• Source documents  
• AE procedures  
• Storage and accountability of study medication materials  
The monitori
ng visits also provide the Sponsor  with the opportuni ty to ensure the 
Investigator ’s obligations and all applicable ICH or health authority regulation 
requirements are being fulfilled.  
The Investigator  must permi t the Medical M onitor, the IRB, the Sponsor ’s internal 
auditors , and represent atives from regulatory authorities direct access to all study -
related documents and pertinent hospital or medical records for confirmation of data 
contained within the eCRFs. All efforts to protect p atient  confidentiality will be upheld. 
An electronic medical record may be the source document; however, the study  site 
must provide a SOP that demonstrates the electronic medical record system is 
compliant with applicable regulations and details  the review and approval of data 
entries by the principal Investigator . 
Protocol deviations identified by the site or the study monitor  should be reported to the 
IRB according to the  IRB’s reporting guidelines . All deviations will be recorded in the 
INC Research clinical trial management system and will be categorized as major or minor prior to data analysis.  
12.1.3  Data Management and Coding 
INC Research  w
ill be respons ible for activities associated with the data management of 
this study. This will include setting up a relevant database (Medidata RAVE) and data transfer  mechanisms, along with appropriate validation of data and resolution of 
queries. Data generated within this clinical study will be handled according to the 
relevant SOPs of the data management and biostatistics departments of INC 
Research. 
Study site staff will enter 
 data directly into the electronic data capture (EDC) system by 
completing the eCRF  via a secure internet connection. Data entered into the eCRF 
must be verifiable against source documents at the study site. Any changes to the data 
entered into the EDC system will be recorded in the EDC audit trail , which  is compliant  
with FDA Code of Federal Regulations  21 Part 11. 
Data entered into the eCRF will be validated as defined in the data validation plan. 
External data c
hecks will be programmed where appropriate (e .g., for laboratory data,

CONFIDENTIAL  ECGs) as well as for cr oss table checking between eCRFs (e .g., AE and concomitant 
medication forms).  
Medical coding will use MedDRA  version 19.0 or higher for concomitant diseases and 
AEs, and WHO -DD version March 2016 or later  for medications.  
Missing or inconsistent data will be queried electronically in the EDC system  to the 
Investiga
tor for clarification. Subsequent modifications to the database will be 
documented.  
13 Records and Supplies  
13.1 Drug Accountability  
Upon receipt of the study medication, the Investigator  (or designee) w ill conduct an 
inventory of the supplies and verify that study medication supplies are received intact 
and in the correct amounts before  completing a supplies receipt.  The Investigator  will 
retain a copy of this receipt at the study  site and provide the original receipt to the study 
monitor , to be stored in the trial master file. The inventory of supplies at the study site 
may be checked at any time during the study by the monitor. 
It is the responsibility of the Investigator  ( or designee) to ensure that the study 
medication has been correctly documented for the amount received, dispensed, and 
return ed on the dispensing log that will be provided.  A full drug accountability log , 
provided by INC Research,  will be maintained at the study  site at all times.  The study 
monitor will arrange regular collection of used and unused study medication returned 
by the patient . The study monitor will also perform an inventory of study medication at 
the c lose-out visit to the study site. All discrepancies must be accounted for and 
documented.  
13.2 Financing and Insurance 
Financing and i
nsurance of this study will be outlined in a separate agreement . 
14 Ethics 
14.1 Institutional Review Board 
Before initiation of the study at the study site, the  protocol, all protocol amendments, 
the ICF, screenshots of eDiary assessments , and any other relevant study 
documentation will be submitted to the IRB . Written approval of the study and all 
relevant study information must be obtained before the study site can be initiated or the 
study medication  released to the Investigator . Any necessary extensions or renewals of 
IRB approval must be obtained, in particular, for changes to the study such as 
modification of the protocol, the  ICF, the written information provided to patient s and/or 
other procedures.  INC Research will submit relevant study documentation to the 
central IRB on behalf of the study sites.  
In the event that a study site uses a local IRB, it is t he responsibili ty of the site 
Investigator to obtain written approval of the study and all relevant study information 
prior to the initiation of study activities. Extensions or renewals of local IRB approval or 
approvals of changes to the ICF or other written information provided to patients will be 
the responsibility of the site Investigator.

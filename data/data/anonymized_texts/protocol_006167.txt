Title of Study
Interventional, open -label, flexible -dose long -term safety study of Lu AF35700 in adult patients with 
schizophrenia
Study Site(s) a nd Number of Patients Planned
120 sites are planned in approximately 15 countries (in -/out-patient clinics). The selected sites will be preferably 
the sites which participated in the study 16159A or in the study 16323A.
Approximately 400 patients with schi zophrenia are planned to be enrolled w ith the following assumptions: 270 
patients who will have completed the study 16159A, 30 patients who will have completed the dosing period of 
the study 16323A and 100 additional patients with schizophrenia for whom a switch of antipsychotic treatment 
can be potentially beneficial . The distribution of the number of patients may be adjusted based upon the 
recruitment rate in each group.
Objectives
Primary objective:
to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the long -term treatment with Lu AF35700.
Exploratory objectives :
to evaluate the long -term safety and tolerability of daily and weekly doses of Lu AF35700 in patients with 
schizophrenia during the 52 -week treatment period
to evaluate the therapeutic effect iveness of daily and w eekly doses of Lu AF35700 in patients with 
schizophrenia over a period of 52 w eeks on:
psychotic symptoms
negative symptoms 
global clinical impression
remission rate
quality of life and functioning
treatment satisfaction
health care resource ut ilisation
Study Methodology
This study is a multi -national, multi -site, open -label, flexible -dose, long -term (52 -week) safety study in 
patients with schizophrenia who have participated and completed a study investigating Lu AF35700 including 
studies 16159 A and 16323A, or in patients with schizophrenia for whom a switch of antipsychotic treatment 
can be potentially beneficial according to the investigator’s clinical judgement (either due to sub -optimal 
symptom control or lack of tolerability of their curren t antipsychotic treatment).
The recruitment of patients who need to change their antipsychotic treatment can start in a given site only after 
the recruitment of the patients in the study 16159A or in the study 16323A is completed.
The adjustment of Lu AF35 700 dosing regimen (10 mg/day or 20 mg/day) during the course of the study will 
be left to the investigator’s clinical judgement. 
For patients who have completed the study 16159A, the daily dosing regimen (10 mg/day or 20 mg/day) can 
be sw itched to w eekly dosing regimen (70 mg/week) according to the investigator’s clinical judgement. The 
number of patients under w eekly dosing regimen will be limited to 50 patients by IVRS/IWRS.
For patients who completed study 16159A (16159A -patients)
The Baseline Visit o f this long -term safety study ( study 16159B) w ill take place at the same visit as the Visit 
12 (Primary Outcome Visit, end of Week 16) of the study 16159A.
After the baseline assessment, for eligible patients, the treatment with Lu AF35700 w ill be initiated at daily 
H.Lundbeck A/S 
Confidential
Page 3of 87dose of 10 mg at Day 1 of study 16159B. In addition, for 16159A- patients , the treatment (Lu AF35700, 
risperidone or olanzapine) received during study 16159A will be tapered down in a blinded fashion and will 
be completed in 7 days. 
At the end o f the first week (Week 1 Visit), all patients will be treated w ith 10 mg/day Lu AF35700 only. 
From  the Week 1 Visit, according to the investigator’s clinical judgement, the 10 mg/day dose can be 
increased to 20 mg/day based on the patient’s response. Ther eafter, the 20 mg/day dose can be reduced to 
10mg/day based on the pat ient’s tolerability to treatmen t.This can occur at scheduled or unscheduled visits.
From the Week 8 Visit , the switch from Lu AF35700 daily dosing regimen to Lu AF35700 w eekly dosing 
regimen can be performed at any consecutive visit according to the investigator’s clinical judgment . The first 
weekly tablet will be taken 7 days after the last daily tablet. The Lu AF35700 w eekly dosing regimen can be 
switched back to a daily dosing regime n of 10 mg/day for tolerability reasons or to 20 mg/day for w orsening 
of the patient’s clinical status. This can occur at scheduled or unscheduled visits. T he first daily tablet will be 
taken 7 days after the last weekly tablet.
For patients who completed the dosing period of the study 16323A (16323A-patients)
The Baseline Visit of study 16159B w ill take place at the same visit as the last day of the dosing period of 
study 16323A.
After the baseline assessment, for eligible patients, the treatment with Lu AF35700 w ill be initiated at daily 
dose of 10 mg at Day 1 of study 16159B. In addition, for 16323A- patients , the treatment (Lu AF35700 or 
quetiapine) received during study 16323A will be tapered down in a blinded fashion and will be completed in 
7 days.
Atthe end of the first week (Week 1 Visit), all patients will be treated w ith 10 mg/day Lu AF35700 only. 
At visits following the Week 1 Visit, according to the investigator’s clinical judgement, the 10 mg/day dose 
can be increased to 20 mg/day based on the patient’s response. Thereafter, the 20 mg/day dose can be reduced 
to 10 mg/day based on the patient’s tolerability to treatment. This can occur at scheduled or unscheduled 
visits.
For other patients who can potentially benefit from treatment with Lu AF35 700 (Other Patients)
After the baseline assessment, for eligible patients, the current antipsychotic treatment will be tapered down 
and completed in 7 days, while the treatment with Lu AF35700 w ill be initiated at a 10 mg/day dose at Day 1.  
The 10 mg/day dose will be maintained during the first week of study 16159B.
At the end of the first week (Week 1 Visit), all patients will be treated w ith 10 mg/day Lu AF35700 only. 
At visits following the Week 1 Visit, according to the investigator’s clinical judgeme nt, the 10 mg/day dose 
can be increased to 20 mg/day based on the patient’s response. Thereafter, the 20 mg/day dose can be reduced 
to 10 mg/day based on the patient’s tolerability to treatment .This can occur at scheduled or unscheduled 
visits.
For all p atients 
Safety and effectiveness assessments will be performed at the end of Weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32,

randomisation in study 16159A and Baseline in study 16159B. Summaries will be prepared overall and by the 
previous treatment (treatment group in the studies feeding into this extension study or previous treatment for 
patients not included in any Lu AF35700 study before). 
Specific tables of adverse events seen shortly after initiation of the weekly dosing regimen w ill be prepared.
The statistical methodo logy will be detailed in a Statistical Analysis Plan.
Sample Size Considerations
No formal sample size calculation has been performed for the present study. 
Approximately 400 patients with schizophrenia are planned to be enrolled in total in order to pro vide relevant 
long-term safety data. It is assumed that about 270 patients will come from study 16159A, 30 patients from 
study 16323A, and an additional 100 patients who need to change their antipsychotic treatment will be 
included. The distribution of the number of patients may be adjusted based upon the recruitment rate in each 
group. With approximately 400 patients included, it will be possible to obtain solid information on long -term 
safety of treatment with Lu AF35700. 
To ensure sufficient exposure to the daily dosing regimen, the number of patients who completed 
study 16159A and who can be treated w ith the weekly dosing regimen will be limited to 50 patients.

Page 8of 87Ethical Rationale for Study and Study Design
This open -label long -term study will provide lo ng-term data of Lu AF35700 for the treatment of patients with 
schizophrenia who have completed studies 16159A or 16323A or for treatment of patients for whom a switch 
to an antipsychotic treatment with Lu AF35700 can be beneficial according to the investigator’s clinical 
judgement (either due to sub -optim al symptom control or lack of tolerability). 
The design of the study is in accordance w ith the Declaration of Helsinki (ethical principles for medical 
research involving human subjects).
The follow ing aspe cts of the current study design will serve as safeguards for the safety and w ell-being of the 
enrolled patients:
At each visit, the investigator will evaluate safety, tolerability, and benefit of treatment, and decide whether 
the patient will continue in t he study.
Safety follow -up contact will be performed 6 w eeks after the last dose of Lu AF35700 (whether it will be a 
Primary Outcome or Withdrawal Visit) to ensure a proper follow -up of the enrolled patients.
The patient may withdraw  from the study at any time, for any reason, specified or unspecified and w ithout 
penalty or loss of benefits to which the patient is otherwise entitled. Unscheduled visits can be made and 
immediate withdraw al is possible if his/her condition worsens.
The patient w ill be fully i nformed about the study including the risks and benefits of his/her participation in 
the study.

directly to the Baseline Visit. The ICF must be signed before any study related activities take place .
b.For 16159A -patien ts, the Baseline Visit will be performed the same day as the Primary Outcome Visit of 
study 16159A. For 16323A -patients , the Baseline Visit will be performed the same day as the last day of the dosing 
period of study 16323A. The inclusion/exclusion criteria are confirmed based on the evaluation of thelatest data 
available in the study 16323A or 16159A as applicable .
c.This visit should take place as soon as possible after the patient withdraws from the study treatment. 
d.The Safety Follow -up Visit will be don e 6 weeks (+3 days) after the last dose of IMP. This visit can be a telephone 
contact, unless a nSAE has occurred since last visit or unless there was a clinically significant abnormal safety 
laboratory test value at the last visit. In such cases, safety f ollow -up(s) must be scheduled to allow for a medical 
examination and/or blood sampling. Further S afety Follow -up Visits beyond 6 weeks may be needed as judged by the

and not in the CRF).
e.If the date of a patient visit does not conform to the study plan, subsequent visits should be planned to maintain the visit 
schedule relative to the Baseline Visit. The number of days between 2 visits sho uld not exceed the number of days for 
which the patient has been dispensed IMP.
f.For 16159A -patients and16323A -patients, the data will be linked respectively from the Screening Visit in the study

to be transferred by the investigator to the eCRF , when applicable .
m.Only for adverse events ongoing at the Primary Outcome /Withdrawal Visitand new SAEs.
n.Only to be taken if the laboratory test was clinicall y significantly abnormal at the Primary Outcome /Withdrawal Visit.
o.Prolactin results will remain blinded throughout the study.
p.For 16159A -patients , additional ECGs will be done; 1 ECG recording before the daily dose is switched to weekly 
dosing (preferably on the day the decision of switchin g from daily to weekly dosing i s taken) and 1 ECG recording the 
day after the first weekly dose is taken.
q.The first dose of IMP should be taken after the Baseline Visit is completed . All treatment assignment and subsequen t 
IMP assignment is done via the IVRS/IWRS. The IVRS/IWRS will be assessed at the unscheduled visit only if the dose 
adjustment requires dispensing of IMP.
r.The dose of IMP can be increased for efficacy or decreased for tolerability at scheduled or unschedu led visits from 
Week 1 Visit.

1.1 Background
1.1.1 Overview
Schizophrenia is a severe, complex, chronic, and disabling ps ychiatric disorder with a lifetime 
prevalence of around 1%.1Schizophrenia is characterised b y profound disturbances in 
thinking, perception, and emotion and the clinical manifestation of the disease encompasses a 
wide range of s ymptoms such as positive sy mptoms (for example, delusions, hallucinations, 
and disorganised behaviour), negative s ymptoms (for example, affective flattening, social 
withdrawal, anhedonia, and poverty of speech), and symptoms of cognitive impairment (for 
example, impaired executive functioning, working memory , and attention deficits). 
Numerous antips ychotics have been developed which all rel y on the same underl ying 
mechanism, namel y interfering with dopamine receptors, and more specifically, dopamine D 2
receptor antagonism. Therapies with phenothiazines, such as haloperidol and thiothixene, are 
effective but induce extra py ramidal sy mptoms (EPS) such as dy stonia, muscle rigidity , 
tremor, and akathisia.2Long-term effects, which develop after months to y ears o f therap y, 
also include tardive d yskinesia. The above -mentioned drugs are referred to as ty pical or 
conve ntional antips ychotics and the adverse effects appear to be directly  related to the 
dopamine D 2receptor blockade in the basal ganglia,3whereas the an
tipsy chotic effect of these 
compounds is dependent on reducing dopamine D 2mediated neurotransmission in the 
mesolimbic tracts (including the nucleus accumbens, stria terminalis, and the olfactory  
tubercle).
Lu AF35700 is a novel deuterated compound with a ffinity  for dopaminergic, serotonergic, 
and α -adrenergic receptors. The receptor binding profile and the pharmacological properties 
derived from animal experiments indicate that Lu AF35700 possesses antipsy chotic activity  
combined with a benign tolerabilit y profile.
The following sections 1.1.2 to1.1.6 provide an overview of the nonclinical and clinical data 
currentl y available for Lu AF35700. Refer to the Investigato r’s Brochure4for more detailed 
information .
1.1.2 Nonclinical Pharmacology Data
Lu AF35700 is a novel deuterated compound with affinity  for serotonergic, dopaminergic, 
and α -
adrenergic receptors, and acts as an antagonist of those receptor ty pes.  The multi-
receptor profile of Lu AF35700 is believed to have an antipsy chotic effect.
Lu AF35700 has similar high affinity for the human serotonergic 5- HT 2A and 5 -HT 6 receptors.  
Like “at ypical antipsychotics”, the affinity  for the human 5 -HT 2Areceptor is substantiall y 
H.Lundbeck A/S 
Confidential
Page 22of 87higher than for the dopamine D 2receptor.  Distinctively , Lu AF35700 has higher affinity  for 
the human dopamine D 1receptor than it has for the human dopamine D 2receptor.
The in vitro receptor profile of high affinit y for 5 -HT 2Aand 5 -HT 6receptors and low affinit y 
for dopamine D 2receptors was confirmed b y in vivo occupancy  studies.  The predicted 
stead y-state concentration resulting in 50% target occupancy  (EC 50) was calculated based on 
in vivo occupancy  and pharmacokinetic (PK) data from rats.  The EC 50for 5 -HT 6(12 ng/mL) 
and 5 -HT 2A(20 ng/mL) receptors is equipotent and much lower than for dopamine D 1
(115 ng/mL) and dopamine D 2(255 ng/mL) receptors.
The potent binding to dopamine D 1receptors combined with a lower affinity  for the dopamine 
D2receptors is believed to result in a beneficial efficacy  profile and a tolerability  profile 
without the troublesome adverse effects associated with extensive dopamine D 2receptor 
blockade, such as extrapy ramidal sy mptoms (EPS), hy perprolactinaemia, sexual dy sfunction, 
and dy sphoria/anhedonia.  Furthermore, given the lack of muscarinic receptor blockade, it is 
expected that Lu AF35700 will not have a negative impact on cognitive performance related 
to muscarinic receptor inhibition.
In animal models, Lu AF35700 inhibited conditioned avoidance responding (CAR), 
amphetamine -induced hyperactivity , and phency clidine (PCP) -induced hy peractivity  at doses 
having no sedative or motor inhibiting effects, indicative of antipsy chotic potential combined 
with few side effects .
Lu AF36152 is the major metabolite of Lu AF35700 and has a pharmacological in vitro and 
in vivo profile which is similar to that of L u AF35700 although it is less potent in vivo .
1.1.3 Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism in Animals
The absorption, distribution, me tabolism, and excretion (ADME) properties of Lu AF35700 
have been characterised in the animal species used for safety  assessment:  Lu AF35700 is well 
absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract (94% in the rat) and the time to maximum observed 
concentration ( tmax) is 0.5 to 1 hour post- dose in rats and dogs.  It is distributed throughout all 
tissues, including the brain.  The protein binding of L u AF35700 is high (95% to 98%) in 
plasma from mice, rats, rabbits, dogs, and humans.  The main route of excretion in rats and 
dog is via the faeces.
Overall, the metabolic pathway s across species are similar and all metabolites observed in 
humans were observed in at least one animal species used for safet y evaluation. Relative 
abundance measurements in plasma following multiple oral administration s showed that the 
potential relevant human metabolites have been adequatel y safet y tested in the animal toxicity 
studies in line with the regulatory  recommendations.

1.1.4 Nonclinical Safety Studies
Safety  pharmacology  studies were conducted with L u AF35700 to examine the effect on the 
major phy siological functions (central nervous sy stem [CNS ], cardiovascular, and respiratory 
systems) in rats and dogs.  The tolerability  and toxicity  of Lu AF35700 was evaluated by  oral 
treatment for up to 13 weeks in mice, 26 weeks in rats, and 39 weeks in dogs.  The potential 
genotoxicity  of Lu AF35700 was eva luated in vitro and in vivo.   The effect of L uAF35700 on 
fertility  and earl y embryonic development was assessed in the rat, and foetal developmental 
toxicity  was assessed in rats and rabbits. 
Both Lu AF35700 and its major metabolite L
u AF36152 show high affinity to cardiac ion 
channels in in vitro systems.  I n a manual patch clamp assay , both compounds inhibited the 
human ether -à-go-go-related gene (hERG) ion channel with concentrations resulting in 50% 
inhibition (I C50) of 0.060 µM and 0.177 µM for Lu AF 35700 and Lu AF36152, respectivel y.
In dogs, electrocardiogram (ECG) waveform morphology  changes (ventricular ectopic beats) 
were observed in the cardiovascular safet y pharmacology study and in the 4 -week oral 
toxicity  study  but ventricular ectopic beats w ere not seen in dogs after 13 and 39 weeks of 
dosing.  An increase in QT cinterval was observed at the highest dose during Weeks 6 and 13 
in the 13- week oral toxicity  study , but QT cprolongation was not observed in the 39- week 
toxicity  study ; although these ECG changes could not be clearl y attributed to treatment, a 
drug-related effect cannot be excluded.
The principal target organs identified in the repeated dose toxicity  studies were the central 
nervous s ystem (clinical observations in mice, rats, and dog s), the rodent mammary  gland 
(prolactin -mediated effects in female mice, male, and female rats), the rodent female 
reproductive organs (prolactin -mediated effects on uterus in rats, and vagina in mice and rats), 
the lungs (phospholipidosis in rats), and th e heart (ECG changes in dogs). 
Lu AF35700 was not genotoxic in standard regulatory  in vitro and in vivo genotoxicity  tests. 
The no
-observed-adverse- effect levels (NOAELs) established in the toxicity  studies were 
20(males)/30 (females) mg/kg/day  in the m ouse, 40 (males)/80 (females) mg/kg/day  in the 
rat, and 3 mg/kg/day  in the dog.  The overall NOAEL  at 3 mg/kg/day  Lu AF35700 was 
established based on a reduced weight gain and an effect on the ECG (QT cprolongation and 
ventricular ectopic beats) at the highest dose in dogs. 
The behavioural and clinical observations in the animals and the toxicological target organs 
defined were as predicted from the pharmacological and chemical properties of Lu AF35700.  
Apart from the potential risk of ECG changes, no oth er effects of Lu AF35700 are considered 
relevant for humans at exposure levels corresponding to those achieved the highest dose 

H.Lundbeck A/S

Page 24of 87tested in the mouse, rat and dog.  Please refer to the Investigator’s Brochure4for the exposure 
ratios.
It is concluded that the toxicological effects of Lu AF35700 were well characterised in the 
toxicology , genotoxicity , and reproductive toxicology  studies and the results support that 
LuAF35700 can safel y be administered to humans at the proposed dose levels.
1.1.5 Clinical Data
1.1.5.1 Overview of Studies
Currently , three studies with L u AF35700 have been completed in healthy subjects 
(studies 14198A, 15867A, and 15868A).  One study  in patients has been completed 
experimentally  (study 14754A).  F inally, two studies are ongoing ( studies 15859A and 
16156A).  As of August 2015, a total of 74 healthy  subjects and 84 patients with 
schizophrenia have been exposed to L u AF35700.
The completed studies in healthy  subjects (all men) comprise the first- in-human (FIH) stud y, 
an AME study , and a PET study .  In the FIH study , 6 subjects received a single 10 mg dose 
and 20 subjects received 3 mg Lu AF35700 together with 3 mg of a non- deuterated 
LuAF35700 analogue once dail y for 18 days.   In each of the AME and P ET studies, 
6subjects received a single dose of 30 mg Lu AF35700.  Based on these studies, L u AF35700 
was safe and well tolerated.
A multiple -ascending -dose (MAD) stud y in 96 patients with schizophrenia has been 
completed experimentally  and preliminary  unblinded data are included in this document.  The 
study  was a double -blind, placebo -controlled study with 10 cohorts of up to 10 patients each.  
The treatment duration was 21 day s in all cohorts.  I n Cohorts 1 to 7, collectively  referred to 
as Part A, male patients received daily  doses of 5, 7.5, 11, 16, 20, or 30 mg/day .  In Cohorts 1 
to 6, the patients were randomised (7 to 3, respectively ) to receive oral solutions of 
LuAF35700 or placebo, and in Cohort 7, all patients received a 20 mg Lu AF35700 tablet 
(one-
half of the patients in this cohort received the tablet in a fasted state and the other half 
received the tablet in a fed state).  In Cohort 8, the sole cohort in Part B, women with 
schizophrenia were randomised (7 to 3, respectively ) to receive an or al solution of 
LuAF35700 or placebo.  I n Cohorts 9 and 10, collectivel y referred to as Part C, male and 
female patients were randomised (7 to 3, respectively) to receive oral solutions of 45 mg 
(Cohort 9) or 75 mg (Cohort 10) Lu AF35700 or placebo once we ekly.  In all cohorts, patients 
who received doses ≥20 mg were up -titrated; refer to the Investigator Brochure4for detailed 
information about the titration schedules used in each cohort.
Study  15859A is an ong oing open -label PET study investigating the occupancy -plasma -
concentration relationship of the D 1, D2, and 5- HT 6receptors in men with schizophrenia. The 
occupancy -plasma -concentration relationship for each of the D 1, D2, and 5- HT 6receptors is 
investigate d in a separate group.  In each of the D 1, D2, and 5- HT 6 groups, up to four 
sequential cohorts of 2 patients each, receive Lu AF35700 doses for up to 21 days starting at 
H.Lundbeck A/S 
Confidential
Page 25of 8710, 20, and 10 mg/day , respectivel y, in the first cohort.  The doses in subsequent coh orts are 
adjusted based on the occupancy  data.
Study  16156A is an ongoing randomised, double -blind, parallel -group, placebo- controlled 
single -and multiple -dose study  investigating the safety, tolerability , and PK properties of 
LuAF35700 in healthy  Japane se and Caucasian men.  The study  consist of three parts:  
PartA, in which Japanese and Caucasian men receive a single dose of 5 mg Lu AF35700; 
Part B, in which Japanese men receive a single dose of 10 mg Lu AF35700; and Part C, in 
which Japanese and Cauca sian men receive a dose of 10 mg/day  Lu AF35700 for 5 day s.
1.1.5.2 Pharmacokinetic s
A preliminary  integrated popPK analy sis was performed on data from studies 14198A, 
14754A, 15867A, and 15868A.  
In the popPK model, the absorption phase was adequately  described by first-order absorption 
(absorption rate constant [k a] = 0.27 L /h) with lag -time (1 h).  The distribution profiles of both 
Lu AF35700 and Lu AF36152 were best described by  two- compartment models with central 
and peripheral compartments.  The population v olume of distribution of L u AF35700 and 
LuAF36152 was estimated to 5442 and 4933 L, respectivel y. Plasma protein binding was 
investigated 
in vitro in human plasma and, overall, L u AF35700 was classified as “highl y” 
protein bound (95% to 99%).  The apparen t oral clearance of Lu AF35700 and L uAF36152 
was estimated to 29 L /h and 15 L /h, respectively .  From the population estimates, the 
elimination half -life for Lu AF35700 and Lu AF36152 was estimated to 143 hours and 
250hours, respectively .
Preliminary  resu lts from the MAD study  indicate that for the patients receiving 
therapeutically  relevant doses of Lu AF35700, the parent compound at Day  21/24 had a 
median t maxof 8hours, mean C maxranging from 24.6 to 43.8 ng/mL, and mean area under the 
curve from zero to 24 hours (AUC 0-24h)ranging from 455 to 759 ng·h/mL.  For the major 
metabolite L uAF36152, the corresponding values were a median t maxranging from 9 to 
14hours, mean C maxranging from 25.2 to 43.8 ng/mL , and mean AUC 0-24h ranging from 475 
to 685 ng·h/ mL.

1.1.5.3 Safety
The main body  of safet y data in patients with schizophrenia comes from the MAD study 
(study 14754A) which has been complet ed.  The other study  in patients with schizophrenia, 
the ongoing PET stud y (study 15859A), is still blinded. 
In the MAD stud y, the adverse events with the highest incidence (>10%) in the L u AF35700 
groups in the daily  dosing cohorts were:  somnolence (33% ), anxiety  (23%), headache (21%, 
placebo level), orthostatic hy potension (19%), dizziness (16%), psy chotic disorder (14%), and 
akathisia (11%).  In the once -weekl y dosing cohorts the adverse events occurring in

Page 26of 87≥2patients in the L uAF35700 groups were ( number of patients out of 12): somnolence (5), 
constipation (4), insomnia (3), anxiety  (2), and musculoskeletal pain (2).  In total there was 
1serious adverse event, increased ps
ychosis, which necessitated hospitalisation of the patient.  
The patient recove red after 9 day s after treatment with paliperidone.  The investigator 
assessed the causality  as not related to the investigational medicinal product (IMP).  All non-
serious adverse events were of mild to moderate intensity , with the exception of one event of 
severe somnolence which resolved after a few hours.  The blinded data from the ongoing PET 
study  showed that anxiety , insomnia, and headache have been reported as adverse events in 
that study . 
Please refer to the Investigator Brochure4for a summary  of the TEAEs with the highest 
incidence in MAD 
study 14754A.
In the MAD stud y, an explorative anal ysis of the effect of treatment on QT cFindicated a 
treatment and dose -related trend for QT cFprolongation.  None of the patients in the study  had 
any symptoms or QT cFvalues that met the potentially  clinicall y significant (PCS) criterion 
(>500 ms or >60 ms increase from baseline) and no observations from ECG or cardiac 
telemetry  were reported as adverse events. 
In the MAD study , in the cohorts with the dai ly dosing regimen, an increase n creatine 
phosphokinase (CPK) value was observed in the Follow- up Period on assessment day s 
immediately  after the termination of L uAF35700 treatment or one week thereafter.  The 
increase occurred in all Lu AF35700 dosing groups and was greatest (descending order) in the 
cohorts where patients received 20, 5, and 16 mg/day .  The median CPK values were within 
the reference range (for men:  60 to 400 I U/L) and never >320 IU/L.  The cohor t in which 
women were treated with L u
AF35700 showed no increase in CPK values during the 
treatment period.  The fractionated CPK anal ysis showed that the post -treatment increased 
CPK values were derived from muscle tissue.  In the cohorts with the once -weekly dosing 
regimen, there were no apparent treatment or dose -related trends in mean or individual CPK 
values.  There were no apparent treatment or dose -related trends in mean or individual data 
for an y of the other clinical laboratory parameters. 
In the MAD study , the safety  and tolerability  was not influenced b y the formulation (oral 
solution versus tablet) or the sex of the patient.
The total number of healthy  subjects (74) who have received Lu AF35700 is lower than that 
for patients (84) and they have generall y been exposed to lower doses of Lu AF35700 for 
shorter duration.  However, the most frequently  reported adverse events in healthy  subjects 
(somnolence, fatigue, headache, and dizziness) were similar to those in patients.
Based on safet y and tolera bility  data from the single -dose PET and AME studies 
(studies 15867A and 15868A) and the FIH stud y in healthy subjects ( study 14198A), and the 
MAD study  in patients with schizophrenia ( study 14754A), a single dose of up to 30 mg 
LuAF35700 and multiple dos es in the dose range 5 to 30 mg/day  or 45 or 75 mg once weekly  
for 21 day s, are safe and well tolerated.

A Lu AF35700 PET study  (study 15868A) was conducted in 6 y oung healthy  men to 
characterise the relationship between the combined plasm a concentration of Lu AF35700 and 
Lu AF36152 and the D 2receptor occupancy  using [11C]-PHNO at different time points from 8 
to 126 hours after dosing.5  A pharmacokinetic/pharmacod ynamic (PK/PD) model was 
established to predict the relationship between pla sma exposure of Lu AF35700/L u AF36152 
and striatal D 2dopamine receptor occupancy . Two E maxmodels were combined with 
simulated plasma concentrations of L u AF35700 and L u AF36152 when dosing 10 mg and 
20mg Lu AF35700 QD for 12 weeks. After 5 weeks of dail y doses of 10 mg and 20 mg, the 
contribution of both L u AF37500 and Lu AF36152 are expected to result in a 48% and 65% 
D2receptor occupancy , respectivel y.6
1.2 Rationale for the Study
The current phase III study , in conjunction with other studies, is part of the L uAF35700 
clinical development programme that is designed to evaluate the safet y and efficacy of Lu 
AF35700 for the treatment of adults with schizophrenia. 
The design 
of the current study  is in accordance with EMA draft Guideline on clinical 
investig ation of medicinal products in the treatment of schizophrenia .7This open -label

3Study Design
3.1 Overview of the Study Design
This study  has been designed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.8
This is a ninterventional, open -label, flexible -dose, long -term safet y study .
This study  will be conducted in compliance with the protocol, Good Clinical Practice9and 
applicable regulatory  requirements.
An overview of the stud y is presented in Panel 1.
Any patient with schizophrenia, who has participated and completed a study investigating Lu
AF35700 , can be included in this study . In addition, patients who are not experiencing an 
acute exacerbation, who are currently  under antipsy chotic treatment and who, according to the 
investigator’s clinical judgement, can potentiall y benefit from treatment with L u AF35700, 
can also be included in this study .
The total study  duration per patient from screening to safet y follow up will be up to 60 weeks. 
The study  will consist of 3 periods:
•Screening period –up to 2 weeks (only for patients no t previously  participating inastudy  
investigating Lu AF35700) 
•Treatment period –52 weeks 
•Safety  follow up period – 6 weeks
Only  the p atients not previously participating in astudy investigating Lu AF35700 will enter
this study  at the S creening Visit, for a screening period of up to 14 day s to assess eligibility . 
Patients previously  participating in astudy investigating Lu AF35700 will enter this study
directl y at the Baseline Visit.
120 sites are planned in approximately  15 countries (in -/out-patient clinics). The selected sites 
will be the sites which participated in studies investigating Lu AF35700 inclu ding and not 
limited to the studies 16159A and16323A (cardiac study ).
Approximately  400 patients with schizophrenia are planned to be enrolled with the following 
assumptions: approximately  270 patients who will have completed the study  16159A, 
approximate ly 30 patients who will have completed the dosing period of the study  16323A 
andapproximately 100 additional patients who will need to change their antipsy chotic 
treatment. The distribution of the number of patients may  be adjusted upon the recruitment 
rate in each group.
H.Lundbeck A/S 
Confidential
Page 29of 87All eligible patients will be initiated on a dail y dose of 10 mg Lu AF35700 at Day  1. Patients 
previously
 treated with another antipsy chotic than L u AF35700 will initiate down -titration of 
their current treatment at Day  1.
At the end of t he 1st week (Week 1 Visit), all patients included in this long
-term safety  study  
16159B will be treated with one antipsy chotic, Lu AF35700 at dail y dose of 10 mg. At visits 
following the Week 1 Visit, according to the investigator’s clinical judgement, the 10 mg/day  
dose can be increased to 20 mg/day  based on the patient’s response. Thereafter, the 20 
mg/day  dose can be reduced to 10 mg/day  based on the patient’s tolerability  to treatment.
Patients previously  participating in a study  investigating Lu AF357 00 will receive a down -
titration wallet from the previous study . The down -titration will be done in a blinded fashion 
and will be completed at Day  7. 
For patients who can potentially  benefit from treatment with L u AF35700 the discontinuation 
of the current oral antipsy chotic medication will be gradually  down -titrated according to the 
corresponding current SmPC or equivalent document/label and will be completed at Day  7.
Only for patients who completed the 16159A study ; atthe end of the 8th week (Week 8 
Visit), according to the investigator’s clinical judgment, the treatment with L u AF35700 dail y 
dosing regimen can be switched to a weekly 70 mg Lu AF35700 dosing regimen . The first 
weekl y tablet will be taken 7 days after the last daily tablet. Thereafter, t he switch from Lu 
AF35700 dail y dosing regimen to Lu AF35700 weekly dosing regimen can be performed at 
any consecutive visit according to the investigator’s clinical judgment. The first weekl y tablet 
will be taken 7 day s after the last daily  tablet. The tr eatment with Lu AF35700 weekl y dosing 
regimen can be switched back to dail y dose of 10 mg for tolerability reasons or to daily dose 
of 20 mg for worsening of the patient’s clinical status. This can occur at scheduled or 
unscheduled visits. The first daily  tablet will be taken 7 day s after the last weekl y tablet.
The adjustment of Lu AF3
5700 dosing regimen (10 mg/day  or 20 mg/day ) will be left to the 
investigato r’s clinical judgement. The number of patients under weekl y dosing regimen will 
be limited to 50 p atients by  the IVRS/I WRS .
All patients, including patients who withdraw, will be sc heduled for a Safety  Follow -Up V isit 
42 day s after last dose of IMP. 
An internal Safet y Committee at H. Lundbeck A/S has been established for L u AF35700 and 
the committee w ill perfor m regular evaluations of the safet y data.
No interim anal ysis is planned.
After completion of the study , the patients will be treated according to normal practise.
3.2 Rationale for the Study Design
The open -label, flexible -dose, long -term safet y stu dydesign aims to obtain information on the 
long-term safet y and tolerability  of Lu AF35700, a new potential treatment for Schizophrenia
H.Lundbeck A/S 
Confidential
Page 30of 87as it is intended to be used in clinical practice. The 52 -week t reatment period is considered to 
be of adequate length to determine the sustained safet y, tolerability  and antipsy chotic 
effect iveness of Lu AF35700.
All p atients with treatment resistant schizophrenia who completed study 16159A are eligible 
to participate in this study . This will enable 
treatment continuity  for patients that received 
treatment with Lu AF35700, as well as, for patients treated with risperidone or olanzapine in 
study 16159A the opportunity  to derive the possible benefits of treatment with L u AF35700
for 52 weeks. In addition ,all patients with schizophrenia who completed study 16323A, a 
cardiac safet y study, are also eligible to participate in this study and w illreceive treatment 
with L u AF35700. Finally , patients with schizophrenia in need of change in antipsy chotic 
treatment will also be eligi ble to participate in this study , tohave the opportunity  to benefit 
from the p
ossible benefits of L u AF35700.
The doses of Lu AF35700 to be used in this study  were selected based on t he aggregate 
safet y, efficacy , pharmacokinetic profile and receptor occu pancy  data . Daily  doses of 10 and 
20 mg are estimated to include the therapeutic dose range of Lu AF35700 tested in study
16159A. In addition, taking advantage of the long half-life of Lu AF35700 a once -weekly  
dose of 70 mg will also be tested. The rationa le for testing the safet y, tolerability , and 
effectiveness of a weekl y dosing is to explore the feasibility  of such a dosing scheme for 
maintenance dosing ; which could result in potential benefits to treatment adherence; which is 
an issue of considerable i nterest in patients with schizophrenia .
Safet y and tolerability will be assessed b y means of withdrawal, reported adverse events,
vitals signs, weight, clinical safety  laboratory  tests, ECGs, and phy sical examinations.
Metabolic adverse events including bo dy weight gain, dy slipidemia, and hypergl ycemia are
adverse events associated with antipsy chotic treatment and represent an important long -term
safet y risk .10The primary  variables for assessing those parameters include body  weight/BMI,
waist circumference, fasting 
plasma glucose, gly cosylated haemoglobin [HbA1c] and lipids
(trigl ycerides, total cholesterol, low -density  lipoprotein [LDL ], and high density  lipoprotein
[HDL ] cholesterol).
The long- term efficacy  will be explored based on the PANSS11a well established scale for 
assessing severit y of the symptoms of schizophrenia. The CGI -S12will be used as an 
additional exploratory  efficacy measure of clinical response to treatment . The exploratory  
assessment of the severity  of the negative symptoms of schizophre nia will be done using the 
NSA -4.13
Improvement in functional outcome and qualit
y of life are important treatment goals in the
long-term management of patients with schizophrenia. In the current study , effects on 
functional outcomes will be explored using clinician -reported outcomes such as the PSP ,14
QLS15and WoRQ .16
Taking into account the substantial health economic burden of schizophrenia , the effect of the 
Lu AF35700 on subjective well -being, treatment satisfaction, disability  and health care 
resource uti lisation will be explored . These will be assessed in the study through patient 
reported outcomes such as MSQ ,17TooL18and HEA.

4.1 Ethical Rationale
Schizophrenia is a severe, complex, chronic, debilitating, and disabling mental disorder with a 
poor prog nosis. Despite the availability  of numerous treatment options, individual response to 
antipsy chotic medication is generall y sub -optimal and variable. The majority  of patients do es
not adequatel y respond to treatment and studies have indicated that only  around 10% of the 
patients with schizophrenia achieve functional remission.19The tolerability  of the current 
antipsy chotic medications is also limited by  numerous adverse events, which hampers the 
treatment adherence, and in turn, the overall outcome of the t reatment. Thus, it is clear that 
the current treatment options for schizophrenia are far from ideal and development of better 
therapies for this indication should be an important priority .
The dose regimen of 10, 20 mg /day and 70 mg/week of Lu AF35700 were determined to be
safe and well tolerated in the ongoing p hase I programme in patients with schizophrenia and
elicited the targeted range of D2 receptor occupancy  in healthy  volunteers ( seeInvestigator’s 
Brochure ).4
This o pen-label long -term study  will provide long -term data of Lu AF35700 for the treatment 
of patients with schizophrenia who have completed a study investigating Lu AF35700 or for 
patients for whom a switch to an antips ychotic treatment with L u AF35700 can be beneficial 
according to the investigator’s clinical judgement (either due to sub -optimal sy mptom control 
or lack of tolerability ). 
The design of the current study  is in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki (ethical 
principles for medical research i
nvolving human subjects).
The following aspects of the current study design will serve as safeguards for the safety  and 
well-being of the enrolled patients:
•At each visit, the investigator will evaluate safet y, tolerability , and benefit of treatment, 
and d ecide whether the patient will continue in the study .
•Safety  follow -up contact will be performed up to 6 weeks after the last dose of 
LuAF35700 (whether it will be a Primary  Outcome or Withdrawal Visit) to ensure a 
proper follow -up of the enrolled patient s.
•The patient may withdraw from the study  at an y time, for an y reason, specified or 
unspecified and without penalty  or loss of benefits to which the patient is otherwise 
entitled. Unscheduled visits can be made and immediate withdrawal is possible if his/ her 
condition worsens.
The patient will be full y informed about the stud y including the risks and benefits of his/her 
participation in the study . Patients entering th isstudy  after having com pleted a study  
investigating Lu AF35700 should be 
informed about thisstudy  as earl y as possible d uring 
their participation in theprevious study investigating Lu AF35700. In accordance with Good 
Clinical Practice ,9qualified medical personnel at Lundbeck will be readil y available to advise 
on study -related medical questions. Medical monitoring will be performed throughout the 
H.Lundbeck A/S 
Confidential
Page 32of 87study . Safet y data will be reviewed regularl y by the Lundbeck LuAF35700 Safet y Committee 
to ensure that prompt action is taken, if needed, to maximise patient safety.
In accordance with Good Clinical Practice ,9the investigator will be responsible for all study -
related medical decisions.
The consent procedures described above will only be implemented if all owed by  local law 
and regulations and will only  be initiated after appropriate approval by  the relevant ethics 
committees.
4.2 Informed Consent
Forpatients not previously  participating in a study investigating Lu AF35700 ,written 
informed consent must be obta ined before the S creening Visit in this study . For p atients 
previously  participating in a study  investigating Lu AF35700
, written informed consent must 
be obtained before the Baseline V isit in this study .
No study -related procedures, including an y screening procedures, may be performed before 
the investigator has obtained written informed consent from the patient and/or his or her legal
representative (if applicable).
Changing (for example, discontinuing or down- tapering) a patient’s concomitant medication s 
prior to the Screening Visit to ensure that the patient meets the selection criteria is a study -
related activity  and must not occur before the Informed Consent Form has be ensigned.
As fasting samples are to be taken at the Screening Visit , the Informed Consent Form must be 
signed a suitable number of day s before the Screening Visit.
If the informed consent process may  be delegated, the requirements for the delegates must be
documented prior to the start of the stud y. National laws must always be adhered to when 
allowing potential delegation. Any delegation must be documented in the site delegation log .
The Investigator must exclude any  adult patient who lacks capacit y to consent for 
himself/herself from participation in the study .The investigator must ide ntify  vulnerable 
patients
, that is, patients whose willingness to participate in this study  might be unduly
influenced b y the expectation , regardless of whether it is justified, of benefits associated with 
participation, or of a retaliatory  response from senior members of a hierarchy  in case of 
refusal to partici pate. Patients thus identified must be excluded from participation in the 
study .
Prior to obtaining written informed consent, the investigator or a designee must explain to the
patients and their le gal representatives (if applicable) the aims, methods, and potential hazards 
of the study  and any  discomfort it may  entail. The patients andtheir legal representatives (if 
applicable) must be informed that their participation in the study  is voluntary  and that they  are 
free to withdraw from the study  at any  time without justify ing their decision. The p atients and
their legal representatives (if applicable) must be informed of the possibility  of withdrawing 
consent (section 8.4).

Page 33of 87The p atients and their legal representatives (if applicable) must be given ample time and 
opportunity  to enquire about details of the study  prior to deciding whether to participate in the 
study .
The Informed Consent Form includes a statement whereb y the patient agrees to communicate 
with their regular doctor of their participation in the study . If the patient does not want his/her 
regular doctor to be contacted and there is no other way  to verify  or establish that the patient 
qualifies for the study , the patient should not be enrolled.
It is the responsibility  of the investigator to ensure that all questions about the study  are 
answered to the satisfaction of the patients andtheir legal representatives (if applicable) . Prior 
to including apatient in the study , an Informed Consent Form must be signed and dated by
the patient and his or her legal representative (if applicable) and signed and dated by  the 
investigator 
or a designee . The patients and their legal representatives (if applicable) must
receive a cop y of the written information ( Patient Information Sheet ) as well as a copy  of the 
signed Informed Consent Form .
The consent procedures described above will only be implemented if allowed by  local law 
and regulations and will only  be init iated after approval by  the relevant ethics committees
(IECs) or institutional review boards (I RBs) .
The blood samples for exploratory  biomarker analy sis may  be shared with academic or public 
institutions; however, Lundbeck will remain full control of the samples and their use on 
accordance with the information in the Patient Information Sheet and a material transfer 
agreement.

The Baseline Visit will take place at the same visit as the Visit 12 (Primary  Outcome Visit, 
end of Week 16) of the study  16159A. 
After the baseline assessment, for eligible patients, the treatment with Lu AF357 00 will be 
initiated at daily  dose of 10 mg at Day  1 of study 16159B. In addition, for 16159A- patients, 
the treatment (Lu AF35700, risperidone or olanzapine) received during study 16159A will be 
tapered down in a blinded fashion with wallets from study 16159A and will be completed in 7 
daysaccording to the following scheme :
•Patients randomised to Risperidone: 4 mg/day  for the first 3 day s; 2mg/day for the 4 
subsequent day s, encapsulated tablets, orall y, once daily
•Patients randomised to Olanzapine: 10 mg/day for the first 3 day s; 5mg/day  for the 4 
subsequent day s, encapsulated tablets, orall y, once daily
•Patients randomised to Lu AF35700: Placebo for 7 day s, encapsulated tablets, orally , once 
daily .
At the end of the first week (Week 1 Visit), all patien ts will be treated with 10 mg/day  
LuAF35700 onl y. 
From the 
Week 1 Visit, according to the investigator’s clinical judgment, the 10 mg/day  dose 
can be increased to 20 mg/day  based on the patient’s response. Therea fter, the 20 mg/day  
dose can be reduced to 10mg/day  based on the patient’s tolerability  to treatment. This can 
occur at scheduled or unscheduled visits.
From the Week 8 Visit, the switch from Lu AF35700 daily  dosing regimen to L u AF35700 
weekl y dosing regimen can be performed at an y consecutive visit according to the investig a-
tor’s clinical judgment. The first weekly  tablet will be taken 7 day s after the last daily  tablet. 
The Lu AF35700 weekl y dosing regimen can be switched back to a dail y dosing regimen of 
10 mg/day  for tolerability  reasons or t o 20 mg/day  for worsening of the patient’s clinical 
status. This can occur at scheduled or unscheduled visits. The first daily  tablet will be taken 
7days after the last weekly  tablet.
The number of patients under weekly  dosing regimen will be limit ed to 50 patients by 
IVRS/I WRS.
For patients who completed the dosing period of the study 16323A ( 16323A- patients)
The Baseline Visit of study 16159B will take place at the same visit as the last day  of the 
dosing period of study 16323A.
After the baseline assess ment, for eligible patients, the treatment with Lu AF35700 will be 
initiated at daily  dose of 10 mg at Day  1 of study 16159B. In addition, for 16323A- patients, 
the treatment (Lu AF35700 or quetiapine) received during study 16323A will be tapered 
down in a blinded fashion and will be completed in 7 days according to the following scheme:

subsequent day s, encapsulated tablets, orall y, once daily.
•Patients randomised to Lu AF35700: Placebo for 7 day s, encapsulated tablets, orally , once 
daily .
At the end of the first week (Week 1 Visit), all patients will be treated with 10 mg/day  
LuAF35700 onl y. 
At visits following the Week 1 Visit, according to the investigator’s clinica l judgment , the 
10mg/day  dose can be increased to 20 mg/day  based on the patient’s response. Thereafter, 
the 20 mg/day  dose can be reduced to 10 mg/day based on the patient’s tolerability  to 
treatment. This can occur at scheduled or unscheduled visits.
For other patients who can potentially benefit from treatment with Lu AF35700 ( Other 
Patients)
After the baseline assessment, for eligible patients, the current antipsy chotic treatment will be 
tapered down and completed in 7 day s, while the treatment with Lu AF35700 will be initiated 
at a 10 mg/day  dose at Day  1. The 10 mg/day dose will be maintained during the first week of 
study 16159B.
At the end of the first week (Week 1 Visit), all patients will be treated with 10 mg/day  Lu 
AF35700 onl y. 
At visits follo wing the Week 1 Visit, according to the investigator’s clinical judgment , the 
10mg/day  dose can be increased to 20 mg/day  based on the patient’s response. Thereafter,
the 20 mg/day  dose can be reduced to 10 mg/day based on the patient’s tolerability  to

6.2 I MPs, Formulations, and Strengths
The IMPs supplied by  Lundbeck in this study  are:
•Lu AF35700 –film-coated tablets in strengths of 10 and 20 mg (once daily) and 70 mg 
(once weekl y) 
6.3 Manufacturing, Packaging, Labelling, and Storage of IMP
s
The IMP swill be manufactured, packaged, labelled, released (b y a qualified person [QP]), 
and distributed in accordance with the principles of Good Manufacturing Practice , under the 
responsibility  of Lundbeck.
H.Lundbeck A/S 
Confidential
Page 49of 87The IMP will be provided in wallet cards.
The wording on the labels will be in accordance with Good Manufacturing Practice regarding 
labelling and national and/or local regulatory  requirements. If additional information is to be 
added when theIMP is dispensed to patien ts, this will be clearl y stated on the labels, and the 
investigator will be instructed to do so.
No manipulation, repackaging, or relabelling of IMP is permitted after QP release by  
Lundbeck, unless a repackaging/relabelling agreement exists, and the docum entation is 
available to the Department of Clinical Supply , H. L undbeck A/S ,and, where necessary , new 
QP releases are made.
The IMP s
will be identified using a unique IMP number.
The IMPs must be stored in a safe and secure location, and in accordance wit h the storage
conditions specified on the labels.
6.4 Method of Assigning Patients to Treatment
All patients will be assigned a screening number by  eCRF s ystem and that will be used to 
identify  them throughout the study .
An interactive voice response sy stem (I VRS) will be used in this study . The IVRS will 
dispense Lu AF35700 daily  dosing (10 or 20 mg), and provide the option to the investigator 
to switch to weekl y dosing regime at the end of the eighth week. The IVRS will restrict the 
number of patients that ca n be assigned to weekl y dosing to 50 patients. The IVRS will allow 
the patient to be switched back from weekl y to daily  dosing.
6.5 IMP Accountability
The IMPs 
must be tracked at each site using two logs:
•asite-specific log to track the complete inventory  (that is, what is shipped between the site 
and the depot )
•a patient -specific log to track what is dispensed to and returned b y the patient
The investigator and the pharmacist (if applicable) must agree to only dispense IMP to 
patients enrolled in the study . The investigator or the pharmacis t (if applicable) must maintain 
an adequate record of the receipt and distribution of the IMPs. This record must be available 
for inspection at an y time.
6.6 Post -study Access to IMP
Post-study access to IMP will not be availa ble. Patients in the study  will have access to 
appropriate medical care after they  complete or withdraw from the study .

Concomitant medication is any  medication other than the IMP sthat are taken during the 
study , including during the Screening P eriod .
The recent and concomitant medications that are disallowed or allowed with restrictions 
during the stu dy are summarised in Appendix II .
Details of all concomitant medication (prescription and over-the-counter) taken at the last 
visit of studies 16159A, and 16623A and taken <3 months prior to the Screening Visit for 
patients in need of a change in antipsy chotic treatment must be recorded in the eCRF at the 
first visit. Any  changes (including r eason for changes) in concomitant medication must be 
recorded at each subsequent visit. For an y concomitant medication initiated or for which the 
dose has changed due to a new disorder or worsening of a concurrent disorder , the disorder
must be recorded as an adverse event. Concomitant medication ,associated with adverse 
events and SAEs, initiated after the last dose of IMP, must be recorded. 
8Study Visit Plan
8.1 Overview
An overview of the procedures and assessments to be conducted during the study  and their 
timing is presented in Panel 2.Further details are in chapter 9.
After completing or withdrawing from the stud y, the patient must be treated in accordanc e 
with usual clinical practice .
8.2 Screening Visit (Visit 1)
Only  patients who did not previously  participate in a study  investi gating Lu AF35700 will 
enter this study  at the screening visit.
The screening period begins after the informed consent has been obtained. W ashout of 
disallowed medications begins , if applicable ,and must comply  with the requirements listed in
Appendix II . Screening evaluations are described in Panel 2.
In exceptional cases, the visit interval between the Screening and Baseline Visit may  be 
extended with consent from the Sponsor Medical Expert, provided the Medical Expert accepts 
the rationale provided for the extension.
The patien t’s eligibility  assessment will be reviewed by  an external medical team based on 
key protocol inclusion and exclusion criteria to promote appropriate patient enro lment and 
data quality . Sites should submit specific screening information within 48 hours fro m the 
Screening Visit . Once all information is obtained, the external medical team confirm the site 
whether the patient can continue screening.

Page 51of 87Decisions regarding inclusion of patients and assessment of patient safet y throughout the 
study primaril y remain at the discretion of the investigator; however, the sponsor or external 
medical team may  request exclusion or discontinuation of a patient based on entry  criteria or 
patient safet y.
8.2.1 Pre-screening
Only  forOther Patients - Each site must record in a pre -screening log which patients attended 
the Screening Visit
8.2.2 Patient Identification Card
Each patient will be provided with a patient identification card that states, at a minimum, the 
name of the IMP, the study  number, the patient identification number, the i nvestigator’s 
name, and an emergency  telephone number providing 24- hour service.
Thepatient identification card should be returned to the investigator upon completion of the 
patient’s participation in the study .
8.2.3 Re-screening
Re-screening is not allowed i n this study .
8.3 Baseline Visit (Visit 2)
Patients previously  participating in a study  investi gating Lu AF35700 will enter in thisstudy  
directl y at the baseline visit. The investigator’s evaluation of the patient’s eligibility  in this 
study  will be done base d on the latest data available in the pr evious LuAF35700 study .
After the baseline visit
,the current antips ychotic or study treatment will be tapered down and 
completed in 7 day s. 
8.4 Withdrawal Visit
Patients who withdraw from the study  prior to the Primary Outcome Visit will be asked to 
attend a Withdrawal Visit , if at all possible. The visit must be scheduled as soon as possible 
after withdrawal.
No new information will be collected from patients who withdraw, except information 
collected in relation to th e scheduled Withdrawal Visit or needed for the follow-up of adverse 
events (section 10.5).
The reason for withdrawal must be recorded on the Reason for W

8.5 Safety Follow -up Visit/Contact ( Visit 18)
The safety  follow -up is conducted to capture 
serious adverse events (SAEs) that occur during 
the Safet y Follow -up Period as well as to follow up on the outcome of adverse even tsongoing 
at the end of the Treatment Period. The safet y follow -up must be conducted 42days (+3 day s) 
after the last dose of IMP .The safety  follow -up may  either be conducted as a visit to the site 
or as a telephone contact.
If any new SAEs have occurred since the last assessment at which the patient received IMP, 
the safet y follow-up must, when possible, be a visit to the site.
For adverse events that were ongoing at the end of the Treatment Period and that resolved
during the Safet y Follow -up Period, the stop date must be recorded. For non-serious adverse 
events still ongoing at the safet y follow -up, the stop date must be recorded as “ongoing”. 
SAEs must be followed until resolution or the outcome is known.
Patients with a clinical safety laboratory  test value that was out-of- range at the Primary  
Outcome or Withdrawal Visit and judged clinically  significant must be followed according to 
accepted medical standards for up to 42days or until the value normalises orstabilises or a 
diagnosis or a reasonable explanation has been established. For these patients, safet y follow-
up visits must be scheduled to allow for a medical examination and/or blood sampling. The 
investigator must decide whether further safet y follow -up visits are required after 42days. If 
further safet y follow- up visits are made, these must be documented in the patient’s medical 
record and not in the eCRF.
Patients who withdrew due to elevated AST or ALT values (see section 5.4) should be 
followed until the values normalise or stabilise or a diagnosis or a reasonable explanation has 
been established (see section 10.5).

9.2.1 Clinician -rated scales
9.2.1.1 Use of clinician -rated scales
The following clinician -rated scales will be used as exploratory  effectiveness assessments :
•PANSS − assessing s ymptoms of schizophrenia
•PSP − assessing personal and social performance
•CGI-S − assessing global impression
•NSA -
4 –assessing the severity  of negative s ymptoms of schizophrenia
•QLS –assessing quality  of life
•WoRQ –assessing readiness to work in patients with schizophrenia
The PANSS , NSA -4 and QL Swill be administered in the local language. The PSP, CGI-S 
and WorQ 
will be administered in English only . Only  scales provided by Lundbeck 
designated provider that,
have been validated in the language to which they have been 
translated, will be used in this study .
Detailed instructions on how to administer the scales and how to score using the scales will be 
provided to the site.
9.2.1.2 Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS)
The PANSS11is a clinici an-rated scale designed to measure severit y of ps ychopathology in 
adult patients with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorders, and other psy chotic disorders. It 
emphasises positive and negative s ymptoms. The PANSS comprises 3 sub -scales with a total 
of 30 items: 7 items constitute the Positive Sy mptoms subscale (for example: delusions, 
conceptual disorganization, and hallucinatory behaviour), 7 items constitute the Negative 
Symptoms subscale (for example: blunted affect, emotional withdrawal, and poor rapp ort), 
and 16 items constitute the General Psy chopathology  subscale (for example: somatic concern, 
anxiety , and guilt feelings). Each item is rated from 1 (sy mptom not present) to 7 (sy mptom 
extremely  severe). Raters using the PANSS should have training in ps ychiatric interview 
techniques and have clinical experience working with patients with schizophrenia and related 
psychotic disorders. The Structured Clinical Interview for PANSS21(SCI –PANSS) will be 
used to facilitate the administration of the PANSS asse ssment.
It takes 30 to 40 minutes to administer and score the PANSS.
9.2.1.3 Personal and Social Performance Scale (PSP)
The PSP14is a clinician -rated scale designed and validated to measure a patient’s current level 
of social functioning.
H.Lundbeck A/S 
Confidential
Page 55of 87The PSP consists of 4 items: socially  useful activities (including work and study ), personal 
and social relationships, self- care, and disturbing and aggressive behaviours. The 4 items are 
assessed on a 6 -point scale, from absent to v ery severe. Based on these assessments and their 
combination, the global score ranges from 1 to 100.
The PSP can be administered b y an experienced clinician after a short training session.
It takes approximately  5 minutes to administer and score the PSP.
9.2.1.4 C linical Global Impression Scale -Severity (CGI- S)
The CGI12was developed to provide global measures of the severit y of a patient’s clinical 
condition during clinical studies. The CGI severity of illness (CGI -S) provides the clinician’s 
impression of the patient’s current state of mental illness. The clinician uses his or her clinical 
experience of this patient population to rate the severity  of the patient’s current mental illness 
on a 7-point scale ranging from 1 (normal - not at all ill) to 7 (among the most extremely  ill 
patients). An experienced clinician can use the CGI after a short training session.
It takes 1 to 2 minutes to score the CGI after a clinical interview.
9.2.1.5 4-Item Negative Symptom Assessment (NSA-4)
The NSA -
413is a clinician rated scale designed to assess the severity  of negative sy mptoms of 
schizophrenia. It consists of 4 items to measure: restricted speech quantity , reduced emotion, 
reduced social drive, and reduced interes ts, as well as an overall global rating of negative 
symptoms. Each of the four items is rated on a 1 to 6 -point scale where ‘1’ represents no 
reduction from normal behaviors associated with the item and ‘6’ represents severe reduction 
or absence of the beh avior. The scale also includes a ”non ratable” designation denoted as ‘9’.
It takes approximately 10 minutes to complete the NSA -4.
9.2.1.6 Quality of Life Scale (QLS)
The QL S15is a clinician -rated scale designed to assess deficit sy mptoms of schizophrenia and 
functioning during the preceding 4 weeks. T he QLS consists of 21 items in 4 subscales: 
Interpersonal Relations (8 items), I nstrumental Role (4 items), Intraps ychic Foundations 
(7items), and Common Objects and Activities (2 items). Each item is rated on a 7 -point scale, 
from 0 (severe impairment) to 6 (normal or unimpaired functioning). Definitions are provided 
for 4 anchor points of the 7 points. Each item has a brief description of the judgement to be 
made and a set of sugg ested probes for the clinician. The mean score is calculated for each 
subscale and the total score for all items ranges from 0 to 126, where the higher score 
indicates normal or unimpaired functioning. The QL S can be administered by  a clinician after 
a sho rt training. 
It takes approximately 45 minutes to administer and score the QL S.

Page 56of 879.2.1.7 Readiness for work questionnaire (WoRQ)
The WoRQ16is a clinician -rated scale designed to measure readiness to work in patients with 
schizophr enia. The WoRQ consists of 8 items: the clinician must rate 7 statements and answer 
one question. The statements are rated on a 4- point scale, from strongly agree, agree, 
disagree or strongly disagree based on all material available (for example, personal notes, 
medical records, input from other health professionals, family  members or caregivers); and in 
the final item, the clinician must indicate if the patient is ready for work or not. The WoRQ 
can be rated b y a clinician after a short training session. 
It takes approximately  5 minutes to administer the WoRQ.
9.2.1.8 Rater Qualification and Certification
The PANSS, PSP, NSA- 4, QL S, and WoRQ should be administrated by  clinicians. 
The CGI -S must be a dministered by  the clinician responsible for the patient.
A clini cian in the context of the study  is defined as a Medical Doctor (MD), Doctor of 
Osteopathic Medicine (DO), or an yone holding a Doctoral or Master’s Degree (or equivalent) 
in a medical or ps ychology related field. 
As a pre -requisite, PANSS raters must be e xperienced in patients with schizophrenia and in 
administering the PANSS. 
Any exceptions must be discussed and approved by  Lundbeck.
Only  raters who have been alread y trained and certified in studies 16159A and 16323A are 
allowed to rate the patients in study 16159B. New raters joining study 16159B will be trained 
and certified using the same certification processes as in 
study 16159A. 
Documentation of training and certification will be delivered to the raters for archiving in the 
investigator stud y maste r file (TMF). No patient may  be rated before the documentation has 
been delivered.
Rater training and certification will be conducted by  a third part y vendor selected b y the 
sponsor.
Each site should have a minimum of 2 certified raters per scale in order to provide back

Medication Satisfaction Questionnaire (MSQ)
The MSQ17is a patient -rated scale designed and validated to assess the patient’s satisfaction 
with his or her current antipsy chotic medication. The MSQ consists of one item that is rated
on a 7- point scale ranging from 1 (extremel y dissa tisfied) to 7 (extremel y satisfied). The 
patient can complete the MSQ without any  training.
It takes less than 1 minute to complete the MSQ.
9.2.2.3 Tolerability and Quality of Life questionnaire (TooL)
The TooL18is a patient -rated scale developed to measure the impact of side -effects on the 
quality  of life in patients treated with antips ychotic medication. The Too L consists of eight 
domains: mood (worry -upset), function capabilities, fatigue -weakness, weight gain, stiffness-
tremor , phy sical restlessness, sexual dy sfunction and dizziness- nausea. Each domain is rated 
on a 4-point scale from 1 (no impact) to 4 (maximum impact). Total scores range from 8 (no 
impact) to 32 (maximum impact).
It takes approximately  5 minutes to complete t he TooL .
9.2.3 Health Care Resource Utilisation
The Health Economic Assessment (HEA) questionnaire will be used to collect resource 
utilisation. The HEA will be provided in English only . Country  specific version will be used 
for US and Canada. Instructions on how to complete the scale will be provided to the site.
The HEA is a questionnaire aiming at monitoring patients’ health care resource utili sation 
such as ph ysicians’ visits, outpatient and inpatient services and other relevant services. Site 
personnel invol ved in the conduct of the study  must ask these questions to the patients at 
selected visits. This allows for relating cost data to clinical efficacy  and safet y, and these data 
may be used for cost -effectiveness anal yses.
The HEA is available in a Baseline Evaluation version which is to be used at the Baseline 
Visit and a Follow -Up Evaluation version which is to be used at Primary  Outcome /
Withdrawal Visit.

9.3 Pharmacokinetic Assessments
Blood samples for IMP quantification (2 mL per time point) will be drawn in 2 mL K3 EDTA 
tube in accordance with Panel 2. The blood sampling and handling procedures are described 
in the study -specific Laboratory Specification Manual .
Sampling time point and sampling date should be recorded. At the visits for PK assessments, 
the time point and date of the latest intake of study  medication should be recorded and the 
patient should be asked about the usual time of study  medication intak e during the period 
since the last visit. 
The blood samples will be anal ysed for Lu AF35700 and Lu AF36152 using an anal ytical 
method validated in accordance with the EMA Guideline on Bioanalytical Method 
Validation22and  the FDA Guidance for Industry .23  
If other metabolites are identified and considered significant, these may  be included in an 
exploratory  anal ysis. The bioanaly sis will be performed by  the Department of Bioanaly sis, 
H.Lundbeck A/S. A bioanaly tical protocol will be prepared by  Lundbeck be fore the plasma 
samples are anal ysed.
The result of the anal ysis will not be reported back to the investigator.

9.4.1
General Considerations
Although the possible future exploratory  biomarker anal yseswill help to increase our 
understanding of the aetiology  of schizophrenia and the molecular basis of the drug response, 
the efforts described in this protocol are strictl y research based. Therefore, as the complex 
interactions between genes and disease ar e currently  not characterised to a level that translates 
to a meaningful clinical advantage, individual results from the exploratory  biomarker anal yses 
will not be given to the patients. For the same reasons, individual results will not be added to 
the pat ients’ medical records.
The patients will have no direct benefit from the exploratory  biomarker analy ses. As blood 
sampling for the exploratory  genomics, proteomics, and metabolomics is an integral part of 
the study , the main Patient Information Sheet cove rs these anal yses. Conversely , blood 
sampling for the possible future genetic biomarker anal ysis is optional and a separate Patient 
Information Sheet covers this analy sis.
The blood samples for biobanking and possible future exploratory  biomarker analy sis,or the 
data derived from these blood samples, may  be shared with academic and public institutions 
and other companies. However, Lundbeck will retain full control of the samples and their use 
in accordance with the information in the Patient Information Sheet and a Material Transfer

Page 59of 87Agreement. Furthermore, the results based on the anal ysis of the samples may  be pooled 
across studies to increase the statistical power of the anal yses.
A patient and/or his or her legal representative (if applicable) may , at an y time and without 
stating a reason, specifically request the destruction of the patient’s exploratory  biomarker 
sample, irrespective of his or her continued participation in the study . The investigator must 
send a written request on behalf of the patient to the international study  manager. The 
investigator will receive written confirmation from L undbeck when the sample has been 
destroy ed.
The blood samples for genomics, proteomics, and metabolomics will be single -coded using 
the patient’s screening number. The blood samples for genetic biomarker analysis will be 
double -coded as described in EMA’s position paper on pharmacogenetic terminology24to 
ensure patient privacy  protection.
The results of the possible future pharmacogenetics, proteomics/metabolomics a nd gene 
expression profiling will not be reported to the investigator.
9.4.2 Blood Sampling for Gene Expression Profiling
Blood samples for gene expression profiling (RNA) will be collected in two PAXgene tubes 
(2,5mL) at each time point. The maximum volume of blood to be collected during the study  
for this purpose will be 10 mL. Samples for gene expression profiling will be shipped to a 
Central Laboratory , United States, for sample storage and possible preparation and anal ysis. 
The result of the anal ysis will not be reported back to the investigator.
Only  the patients not previously  participating in a study  investigating Lu AF35700 will have 
blood drawn for gene expression profiling.
9.4.3 Blood Sampling for Metabolomic/Proteomic Biomarkers
Blood samples for metabolo mic/proteomic biomarkers will be collected in one 10mLK2 
EDTA tube at each time point. The maximum volume of blood to be collected during the
study  for this purpose will be 20mL. The samples for metabolomic/proteomic biomarkers 
will be shipped to a Cen tral Laboratory , United States, for sample storage.
Only  the patients not previously  participating in a study  investigating Lu AF35700 will have 
blood drawn for metabolomics/proteomic biomarkers.
9.4.4 Blood Sampling for Pharmacogenetics
It is optional for the p atient to donate a blood sample for exploratory  pharmacogenetic 
analysis. A blood sample (9 mL) will be collected in K3 EDTA tubes for subsequent DNA 
extraction. Blood tubes will be shipped on dry  ice to a Central Laboratory, United States, 
where DNA will 
be extracted and retained. DNA aliquots will be shipped to a Central 
H.Lundbeck A/S

Page 60of 87Laboratory , for storage. The genetic variants to be anal ysed may  include single nucleotide 
polymorphisms (SNPs) and copy  number variations (CNVs). The anal ytical methods may  be 
polymerase chain reaction (PCR), qPCR (quantitative PCR), sequencing, or whole genome 
scans on microarray s.
The results of these anal yses are not specifically related to this study . The sample will be 
stored at a Central Laboratory , United States.
Only  patients not previously  participating in a study  investigating Lu AF35700 will have 
blood drawn for pharmacogenetic analy sis.
9.5 Safety Assessments
9.5.1 Adverse Events
The p atients will be asked a non -leading question (for example , “how do you feel?” , “how 
have you felt since your last 
visit?” ) at each visit, starting at the Screening Visit . Adverse 
events (including worsening of concurrent disorders , new disorders , and pregnancies) either 
observed b y the investigator or reported spontaneously b y the patient will be recorded, a nd 
the investigator will assess the seriousness and the intensity  of the adverse event and its 
relationship to the IMP. Results from relevant tests and examinations, such as clinical safet y 
laboratory  tests, vital signs, and ECGs, or their corresponding co nditions will also be recorded 
as adverse events if considered b y the investigator to be clinically  significant.
See chapter 10for further information on adverse events.

The blood sampling and handling procedures are described in the study -specific Laboratory 
Specification Manual.
The blood samples will be anal ysed at the central laboratory .
The investigator must review (initial and date) the results of the clinical safety laboratory  tests 
as soon as possible after receipt of those results. Out -
of-range values must be interpreted by  
the investigator as “not clinically  significant” or “clinically  significant” with a comment 
concerning the planned follow -up. Tests for clinically  significant out -of-range values must be 
H.Lundbeck A/S 
Confidential
Page 62of 87repeated, or an appropriate clinical follow- up must be arranged by  the investigator and 
documented on the laboratory  report, until the value has stabilised or until the value has 
returned to a clinicall y acceptable value (regardless of relationship to I MP). Any  value that is 
out-of- range at the Primary  Outcome or Withdrawal Visit and judged clinically  significant 
must be followed according to accepted medical standar ds for up to 42 days or until the value 
normalises or stabilises or a diagnosis or reasonable e xplanation has been established. Any 
out-of- range values followed after the last protocol -specified contact with the patient will be 
documented in the patient’s medical record.
Clinically  significant out -of-range values must be recorded as an adverse event on an Adverse 
Event Form .
The central laboratory  will be notified by the sponsor w hen the biological samples may be 
destroy ed.
9.5.3 Vital Signs
Pulse rate and blood pressure will be measured using a standard digital meter.
Pulse rate and blood pressure will be measured in the following order: supine, sitting, and 
standing after the patient has rested in each position for at least 3 minutes.
Vital signs must be assesse d prior to blood sampling.
Abnormalities of clinical significance must be recorded as an adverse event on an Adverse 
Event Form.
9.5.4 Weight and Waist Circumference
The p atients will be weighed wearing light clothing and no shoes.  A similar amount of 
clothing must be worn on each occasion.
Waist circumference should be recorded before the patient’s meal and at approximately  the 
same time at each visit. The measurement will be made b y locating the upper hip bone and the 
top of the right iliac crest and placing a weighted measuring tape in a horizontal plane around 
the abdomen at the level of the crest. Before reading the tape measure, the assessor should 
ensure that the tape is snug, but does not compress the skin, and is parallel to the floor.  The 
measurement i s to be made at the end of a normal exhalation.
Two waist measurements will be performed. If the two measurements are differing b y 1 cm or 
more, a third measurement will be performed. Waist circumference is the average of all the 
measurements performed.
Abnormalities of clinical significance must be recorded as an adverse event on an Adverse 
Event Form .

Page 63of 879.5.5 Electrocardiograms (ECGs)
A standard 12- lead ECG will be recorded using digital ECG recording equipment provided to 
the investigator or, upon agreement, to an ex ternal cardiology  centre.  The ECGs will be 
transferred 
digitall y to a central ECG laboratory for evaluation.  The investigator will be 
provided with the results and a cardiological interpretation of the ECG from the central ECG 
laboratory .
The result s from the central ECG laboratory  will include the RR, PR, QRS, QT, and QT c
intervals.
The investigator has the final decision on the interpretation of the ECG results .Abnormalities 
of clinical significance must be recorded as an adverse event on an Adverse Ev entForm .
ECGs will be recorded according to the time schedule provided in Panel 2.
For 16159A- patients, additional ECGs will be performed at the time of switching from dail y 
dosing to weekly  dosing ; 1 ECG should be recorded before the dail y dose is switched to 
weekl y dosing (preferably  on the day  the decision of sw itching from dail y dosing to weekly 
dosing is taken), and 1 ECG should be recorded the day  after the first weekly  dose in taken.
9.5.6 Physical Examination
The investigator may  appoint a designee to be primarily  responsible for performing the 
physical examination s provided this is permitted according to local regulations. The
investigator must take responsibility  for reviewing the findings. Whenever possibl e, the same 
individual should perform all the phy sical examinations.
The ph ysical examination (including he ight at the Screening and Baseline V isit) must, at a 
minimum, include an examination of appearance, extremities, skin, head, neck, ey es, ears, 
nose, throat, lungs, chest, heart, abdomen and musculoskeletal s ystem and must b e performed 
by a ph ysician or ph ysician assistant .
Genito- urinary  system examinations are often not part of routine ps ychiatric practice.  For 
most patients, an external inspection o f the genitals should be sufficient. A full 
gynaecological examination should only  be performed if warranted by  symptoms or medical 
history .  The renal regions will be examined as part of the abdominal examination.
Abnormalities of clinical significance mu stbe recorded as an adverse event on an Adverse 
Event Form .
9.5.7 Safety Assessment Tools
The following safet y assessments will be administered:
•C-SSRS –clinician- rated assessing suicidality
•AIMS –clinician -rated assessing abnormal involuntary  movements
H.Lundbeck A/S 
Confidential
Page 64of 87•BARS –clinician -rated, assessing akathisia
•mSAS –clinician -rated, assessing extrapy ramidal sy mptoms
The C -SSRS will be administered in the local language. The AIMS, BARS and mSAS will be 
administered in English only . Only scales provided by H. Lundbeck A/S a nd that have been 
validated in the language to which they  have been translated will be used in this study .
Detailed instructions on how to administer the scales and how to score using the scales will be 
provided to the site.
9.5.7.1 Columbia- Suicide Severity Ratin g Scale (C-SSRS)
The C -SSRS is a semi -structured interview developed to systematically assess suicidal 
ideation and behaviour of patients participating in a clinical study . The C -SSRS has 4 
questions addressing suicidal behaviour, 5 questions addressing su icidal ideation, and sub -
questions assessing the severit y.
The C -SSRS is available in a Baseline/Screening version which is to be used at the Screening 
Visit and a Since last visit version which is to be used at all subsequent visits.
An experienced clinic ian can use the C -SSRS after a short training session. It takes 
approximately  5 minutes to administer and rate the C -SSRS .
9.5.7.2 Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS)
The AIMS25is a clinician -rated scale designed to assess abnormal involuntary movements 
(for example, dy skinesia) associated with anti-ps ychotic drugs. The AIMS consists of 12 
items: items 1 to 7 assess the severit y of movements in 3 anatomical areas (facial/oral, 
extremities and trunk); items 8 and 9 assess the global severit y and the incapacit ation due to 
the movements; item 10 assesses the patient’s awareness of the movements and the distress 
due to them; items 11 and 12 clarify  the patient’s dental status. The 12 items are assessed 
using a neurological examination: items 1 to 9 are rated on a 5-point scale, from 0 (none) to 4 
(severe); item 10 is rated on a 5 -point scale, from 0 (no awareness) to 4 (aware, severe 
distress); and items 11 and 12 are rated on a 2 -point scale, 0 (no) and 1 (y es). The total score 
ranges from 0 to 42. The AI MS can b
e administered by  a phy sician after a short training. 
It takes approximately  5 to 10 minutes to administer and score the AIMS.
9.5.7.3 Barnes Akathisia Scale (BARS)
The BARS26is a clinician -rated scale designed to assess the presence and severity  of drug 
induced akathisia. The BARS consists of 4 items: one objective item (observed restlessness), 
two subjective items (patient’s awareness of restlessness and related distress), and a global 
clinical assessment of akathisia. The objective and subjective sy mptoms are r ated on a 4 -point 
scale, from 0 (no s ymptom) to 3 (severe s ymptoms). The global clinical assessment is rated 
on a 6-point scale from 0 (absent) to 5 (severe akathisia). Comprehensive definitions are 
H.Lundbeck A/S 
Confidential
Page 65of 87provided for each anchor point on the scales. The BARS ca n be administered by  a phy sician 
after a short training session. 
It takes 10 to 15 minutes to administer and score the BARS.
9.5.7.4 Modified Simpson Angus Scale (mSAS)
The mSAS ,27is a clinician -rated scale designed to assess the presence and severity  of drug -
induced parkinsonism. The mSAS consists of 10 items to evaluate gait, rigidity  (arms and 
head), ey e-blinking, tremor, salivation and akathisia. The 10 items are assessed using a 
neurological examination and rated on a 5 -point scale, from 0 (absence of the con dition) to 4 
(most extreme form of the condition). Comprehensive definitions are provided for each 
anchor point on the scale. The mSAS can be administered by  a ph ysician after a short training 
session. 
It takes 10 to 15 minutes to administer and score the mSAS.
9.5.7.5 Rater Qualification and Certification
The C -SSRS should be rated b y a clinician (see 9.2.1.8 ). The AIMS, BARS, and mSAS must 
only be administrated by  physicians having adequate experience in patients with
schizophrenia. An y exceptions must be discussed and approved b y Lundbeck.
Only  raters who have been already  trained and certified in studies 16159A and 16323A are 
allowed to rate the patients in study 16159B. New raters joining study 16159B will be trained 
and certified using the same certification processes as in 
study 16159A. 
Documentation of training and certification will be delivered to the raters for archiving in the 
investigator stud y master file (TMF). No patient may
 be rated before the documentat ion has 
been delivered.
Rater training and certification will be conducted by  a third part y vendor selected b y the 
sponsor.
Each site should have a minimum of 2 certified raters per scale in order to provide back -up 
for each other. An y exceptions must be d iscussed and approved b y Lundbeck.
9.6 Order of A ssessments
The scales should preferably  be administered in the following order at the applicable visits:
Screening Visit :
•PANSS, PSP, and C -SSRS

9.7 Treatment Compliance
The responsible stud y personnel will dispense the IMPs. Accountability and compliance 
verification should be documented in the patient’s source documents. Patients must be 
counselled on the importance of taking the study  medications as directed at all study  visits.
The medical monitor should be contacted if the investigator is uncertain whether a patient’s 
lack of compliance warrants withdrawal from the study .
Patients m ust be counselled on the importance of taking the IMP as directed at all study  visits. 
9.8 Total Volume of Blood Drawn and Destruction of Biological Material
The total volume of blood drawn from each patient will be approximately  110 mL during the 
study .
Addi tional blood samples may be required if the original blood samples are not viable or if re -
testing is required.
The biobank blood samples and an y derived material for possible future exploratory  
pharmacogenetic anal yses will be destroy ed ≤15years after the end of the study (see 
definition in section 8.6) by  a Central Laboratory .
Thebiobank blood samples and an y derived material for possible future exploratory  gene 
expression profiling and metabolic or proteomic biomarker assessments will be destro yed 
≤10years after the end of the study  (see definition in section 8.6) by  a Central Laboratory .
All samples for pharmacokinetic assessment will be retained at the bioanalytical facilit y until 
the results have been reported. The samples will subsequently  be destroy ed by  the responsible

Page 67of 8710Adverse Events
10.1 Definitions
10.1.1 Adverse Event Definitions28
Adverse event –is an y untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study patient administered a 
medicinal product and which does not necessaril y have a causal relationship with this 
treatment.
An adverse event can therefore be any  unfavourable and unintended sign ( including clinically  
significant out -of-range values from relevant tests, such as clinical safety laboratory  tests, 
vital signs, ECGs), s ymptom, or disease temporally  associated with the use of a m edicinal
product , regardless of whether it is considered related to the medicinal product .
Serious adverse event (SAE) –is an y adverse event that:
•results in death
•is life -threatening (this refers to an event in which the patient was at risk of death at t he 
time of the event; it does not refer to an event that hy pothetically  might have caused death 
had it been more severe)
•requires inpatient hospitalisation or prolongation of existing hospitalisation
•results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity
•is a congenital anomal y/birth defect
•is medically  important (this refers to an event that may  not be immediatel y life-threatening 
or result in death or hospitalisation, but may  jeopardise the patient or may  require 
intervention to prevent any  of the SAE s defined above)
Examples of medically  important events are intensive treatment for allergic bronchospasm ;
blood dy scrasia or convulsions that do not result in hospitalisation; or development of drug 
dependency ordrug abuse.
Planned hospitalisations or surgical interventions for a condition that existed before the 
patient signed the Informed Consent Form and that did not change in intensity  are not SAEs. 
Emergency  room visits that do not result in admission to the hospital are not necessarily  
SAEs; however , they  must be evaluated to determine whether they  meet any  of the SAE 
definitions (for example, life -threatening or other serious [medically  important] event).
The C -SSRS has 5 questions addressing suicidal ideation. If level 4 or 5 has been answered 
“yes”, it must be considered by  the investigator whether an SAE should be reported.
Non-serious adverse event –is any  adverse event that does not meet the definition of an SAE.
If there is an y doubt as to whether an adverse event meets the definition of an SA E, a 
conservative viewpoint must be taken, and the adverse event must be reported as an SAE.
H.Lundbeck A/S 
Confidential
Page 68of 87Suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction (SUSAR) – is any  adverse event that is 
assessed as serious, unexpected (its nature or intensity is not consistent wit h the current 
version of the Investigator’s Brochure for Lu AF35700) and related to LuAF35700 b y either 
the investigator or the sponsor.
Overdose –is a dose taken by  a patient that exceeds th e dose prescribed to that patient. Any  
overdose (and associated symptoms) must , at a minimum, be recorded as a non -serious 
adverse event .
10.1.2 Adverse Event Assessment Definitions
Assessment of Intensity
The investigator must assess the intensity of theadverse event using the following definitions, 
and record it on the Adverse Event Form :
•Mild –the adverse event causes minimal discomfort and does not interfere in a significant 
manner with the patient’s normal activities.
•Moderate – the adverse event is sufficiently  uncomfortable to produce some impairment of 
the patient’ s normal activities.
•Severe –the adverse event is incapacitating , preventing the pa tient from participating in his 
or hernormal activities.
Assessment of Causality
The investigator must assess the causal relationship between theadverse event and the IMP
using the following definitions, and record it on the Adverse Event Form and the Serious 
Adverse Event Form (if applicable):
•Probable –the adverse event has a strong temporal relationship to the IMP or recurs on 
rechallenge, and another aetiology  is unli kely or significantly less likel y.
•Possible –the adverse event has a suggestive temporal relationship to the IMP, and an 
alternative aetiology  is equally  or less likel y.
•Not related –the adverse event has no temporal relationship to the I MP or is due to 
underly ing/concurrent illness or effect of another drug (that is, there is no causal 
relationship between the IMP and the adverse event ).
An adverse event is considered causall y related to the use of the IMP when the causalit y 
assessment is probable or possible .
Assessment of Outcome
The investigator must assess the outcome of theadverse event using the following definitions, 
and record it on the Adverse Event Form and the Serious Adverse Event Form (if applicable):
•Recovered – the patient has recovered co mpletel y, and no symptoms remain.
•Recovering –the patient’s condition is improving, but sy mptoms still remain.
H.Lundbeck A/S 
Confidential
Page 69of 87•Recovered with sequelae –the patient has recovered, but some sy mptoms remain (for 
example, the patient had a stroke and is functioning normall y, but has some motor 
impairment).
•Not recovered – the patient’s condition has not improved and the s ymptoms are unchanged 
(for example, an atrial fibrillation has become chronic).
•Death
10.1.3 Study -specific Adverse Event Definitions
10.2 Pregnancy
Although not necessaril y considered an adverse event, apregnancy  in a patient in the study  
must be recorded on an Adverse Event Form , as well as on a Pregnancy Form (paper), even if 
no adverse event associated with the pregnancy  has occurred. Pregnancies must be reported to
Lundbeck using the same expedited reporting timelines as those for SAEs.
An uncomplicated pregnancy  should not be considered an SAE. If, however, thepregnancy  is 
associated with an SAE, the appropriate serious criterion (for example, hospitalisation) mus t 
be indicated on the Serious Adverse Event Form . Examples of pregnancies to be reported as 
SAEs (medicall y important) are spontaneous abortions, stillbirths, and malformations.
The investigator must follow up on the outcome of the 
pregnancy  and report it on a 
Pregnancy Form (paper).  The follow- up must include information on the neonate at least up 
until the age of 1 month.
If the partner of a ma nparticipat ingin the study  becomes pregnant, the outcome of the 
pregnancy  should be followed if the partner ag rees.  The partner must sign an Informed 
Consent Form to allow the investigator to collect information to report to Lundbeck .
10.3 Recording Adverse Events
Adverse events (including pre -treatment adverse events) 
must be recorded on an Adverse 
Event Form . The investigator must provide information on the adverse event , preferabl y with 
a diagnosis, or at least with signs and s ymptoms; start and stop dates (and start and stop time 
if the adverse event lasts less than 24 hours) ; intensity ; causal relationship to I MP; action 
taken; and outcome. If the adverse event is an overdose, the nature of the overdose must be 
stated (for example, medication error, accidental overdose, or intentional overdose). If the 
intensity  changes during the course of the adverse event, this must be recorded on the AE 
Intensity Log.
If the adverse event is serious
, this must be indicated on the Adverse Event Form . 
Furthermore, the investigator must fill out a Serious Adverse Event Form and report the SAE 
to Lundbeck immediately  (within 24 hour s) after becoming aware of it (section 10.4).
Adverse events , including clinically  significant out
-of-range clinical safet y laboratory  test 
values and findings from for example, ECGs, must be recorded individual ly, except when 
H.Lundbeck A/S 
Confidential
Page 70of 87considered manifestations of the same medical condition or disease state; in such cases, they  
must be recorded under a single diagnosis.
10.4 Reporting Serious Adverse Events
The investigator must report SAEs to L undbeck immediately  (within 24 hours) after 
becoming aware of them by  completing a Serious Adverse Event Form .
The initial report must contain as much information as possible and, if more information 
about the patient’s condition becomes available, the Serious Adverse Event Form must be 
updated with the additional information.
If the investigator cannot report the SAE in Rave®, then he or she must complete and sign the 
Serious Adverse Event Fallback Form and send it to:
Pharmacovigilance (PV)
Fax: +45 36 30 99 67
e-mail: safet y@lundbeck.c om
Lundbeck will assume responsibility  for reporting SAEs to the authorities in accordance with 
local regulations.
It is the investigator’s responsibility  to be familiar with local requirements regarding reporting 
SAEs to the IEC orIRB and to act accordingl y.
Lundbeck will assume responsibility  for reporting SUSARs to the authorities in accordance 
with local regulations. In those Member States of the European Union that have implemented 
the European Union Clinical Trials Directive29and in Norway , Liechten stein, and Iceland, 
that is, in the countries where unblinded expedited safet y reporting is required, Lundbeck will 
also assume responsibility for reporting SUSARs to the ethics committees.
Lundbeck will assess the expectedness of SAEs and inform the inves tigator(s) about 
SUSARs, at 6 monthly  blinded SUSAR listings. CIOMS -I reports for SUSARS are not 
normally  distributed to investigators in those countries where SUSAR listings are sufficient. 
However, if the CIOMS -I reports are required (for example, by  thelocal EC/I RB/REB), they  
will be sent to the investigator.
10.5 Treatment and Follow -up of Adverse Events
Patients with adverse events must be treated in 
accord ance with usual clinical practice at the 
discretion of the investigator.
Non-serious adverse events must be followed up until resolution or the safety  follow -up 
assessment, whichever comes first. At the safety follow -up, information on new SAEs , if an y, 
and stop dates for previously  reported adverse events must be recorded.
H.Lundbeck A/S 
Confidential
Page 71of 87It is the responsibility  of the investigator to follow up on all SAEs until the patient has 
recovered, stabilised, or recovered with sequelae, and to report toLundbeck all relevant new 
information using the same procedures and timelines as those for the initial report. Relevant 
informa tion includes discharge summaries, autopsy  reports, and medical consultations.
SAEs that are spontaneously  reported b y a patient to the investigator after the safet y follow -
up assessment must be handled in the same manner as SAEs that occur during the stud y. 
Thes e SAEs will be captured in the PV database.
Patients with clinically  significant out-of- range clinical safet y laboratory  test values at the 
Primary  Outcome or Withdrawal Visit must be followed in accordance with usual clinical 
practice and be schedu led for a Safet y Follow -up Visit to allow for a medical examination 
and/or blood sampling (see section 8.5).
Patients who withdr a
w due to elevated AST or ALT values (see section 5.4) must be followed 
until the values normalise or stabilise or a diagnosis or a reasonable explanation has been 
established. Additional medical examinations (for example, ultrasound scanning and/or 
sampling for serology , conjugated bilirubin, INR) should be considered. A gastroenterology  
or hepatology  consultation should also be considered.
11Data Handling and Record Keeping
11.1 Data Collection
11.1.1 Electronic Case Report Forms (eCRFs)
eCRF swill be used to collect all the data related to the study , exce pt the external data 
described in section 11.1.3.
The eCRFs use third party  software (Rave®) to capture data via an on -line sy stem on a 
computer. Data related to the study  will be recorded electronically  in a ce ntral database over 
encry pted lines, and all entries and modifications to the data will be logged in an audit trail. 
Access to the s ystem will only  be granted after appropriate and documented training. Written 
instructions for using the sy stem will be prov
ided along with the training.
Electronic signatures will be used where signatures are required on pages and/or visits. 
Automated data entry  checks will be implemented where appropriate; other data will be 
reviewed and evaluated for accuracy  by the CRA. All entries, corrections, and changes must 
be made b y the investigator or adelegate .

Page 72of 8711.1.2 Patient Binders
11.1.2.1 Use of Patient Binders
Lundbeck may provide a Patient Binder for each patient.  The Patient Binder contain s
different ty pes of source documents, organised by visit and ty pe. A ballpoint pen with 
waterproof ink must be used to enter information in the Patient Binder .
11.1.2.2 Rating Scales and Patient -reported Outcomes (PROs)
The Patient Binder contain spaper versions of the rating scales and PROs. They  will be 
complete d by the rater(s) and patient ,respectivel y. The data will be transcribed to the Scoring 
Sheets in the eCRF b y the investigator or a delegate.
The rater (s)must verify  that all the entries in the Scale Section are accurate and correct by  
signing and dating the relevant pages.
The patients will be asked to comp lete the PROs in their local language. The patients’ 
responses may only be corrected by the patient .
11.1.2.3 Serious Adverse Event Fallback Forms
Serious Adverse Event F allback Formsmust be used 
when the eCRF cannot be accessed.
11.1.3 External Data
All electronic data will be transferred using a secure method accepted b y Lundbeck.
The electronic data received from the following vendors will be kept in a secure designated 
storage area outside the eCRF :
•The clinical safet y laboratory test results will be transferred by central laboratory .
•The ECG results will be transferred by the central ECG service provider.
•If any electronic assessment tools (i.e PANSS, CGI -S, PSP , SAS, AI MS, BARS, NSA -4, 
QLS, WorQ, C -SSRS) and/or patient reported outcomes (i.e TooL, MSQ and HEA) will be 
used, the results will be transferred by the designated vendor.
11.2 Retention of Study Documents at the Site
11.2.1 eCRF Data
If a site close sbefore the study has been completed, the investigator will continue to have 
read-only access to the eCRF. If a site closes after the study  has been completed , the 
investigator will no longer have read access to the eCRF. Instead, each site will be provided 
with a CD -ROM containing the data related to the site (including e CRF data, queries, and the 
audit trail). As a CD -ROM is not considered a durable medium and may  therefore not be 
H.Lundbeck A/S 
Confidential
Page 73of 87readable for the full retention period (for example, 15 y ears [if required by  the applicable 
regulatory  requirements]), it is possible for the investigator to request a new CD -ROM with 
the data related to the site.
11.2.2 Other Study Documents
The investigator must keep the investigator’s set of documents in the investigator TMF for at 
least 15 y ears after the C linical Study R eport has been approved or in accordance with 
national requirements, whichever is longer .
Since off-site storage is used, a study -
specific binder will remain at the site after the other 
study -specific documents have been shipped for off -site storage . This binder is considered 
part of the investigator TMF and must be kept in a secure place b y the site for the required 
period of time. The binder must contain, at a minimum, the following documents: a cop y of 
the Investigator TMF Index , a certified copy  of the Patient Identification Code List, and a 
Retrieval Form .
Lundbeck will notify the investigator in writing when the required storage period has expired 
and when the documents may  be destroy ed according to regulations.
12Monitoring Procedures
Prior to including patients in the study , the investigator must sign a source data agreement that 
identifies the source documents (original documents, data, and records) at the site. The 
document will also list which data may  be recorded directl y on the eCRFs or an y electronic 
clinical outcome assess ment electronic clinical outcome assessment ( eCOA ).
If the investigator does not have a patient’s medical records, the investigator must attempt to 
obtain copies or a written summary  of relevant medical records from the doctor who had 
treated the patient e arlier and include the pertinent documentation in the patient’ s medical 
records at the site . The investigator must obtain medical records documenting the patient’ s 
lifetime (schizophrenia) episodes and general medical history  for the 3 months prior to the 
study .
During the study , the CRA will visit the site to ensure that the protocol is being adhered to
andthat all issues are being recorded, to perform source data verification, and to monitor IMP
accountabilit y. The visit intervals will depend on the outc ome of the remote monitoring of the 
eCRFs, the site ’s recruitment rate ,and the compliance of the site to the protocol and Good 
Clinical Practice .  In addition, the CRA will be available for discussions by telephone.
Source data verification requires that 
the CRA be given direct access to all the source 
documents . Direct access includes permission to examine, analy se,and verify  any records and 
reports that are important forthe evaluation of the study .
H.Lundbeck A/S 
Confidential
Page 74of 8713Audits and Inspection s
Authorised personnel from Globa l Clinical Quality  Assurance at Lundbeck and quality  
assurance personnel from business partners may  audit the study  at an y time to assess 
compliance with the protocol and the principles of Good Clinical Practice and all other 
relevant regulations.
The pati ents must be informed that authorised personnel from Lundbeck may wish to review
their medical records. The investigator must be aware and the patients must be informed that 
representatives from regulatory  authorities may  also wish to inspect source data, such as 
medical records.
The investigator must notify  Lundbeck, without delay , of an announced inspection by  a 
regulatory  authority .
During audits and inspections, the investigator must permit direct access to all the source 
documents, including medical re cords and other documents pertinent to the study .
During audits and inspections, the auditors and inspectors may  copy relevant parts of medical 
records. No personal identification apart from the screening number will appear on these 
copies.
Patient data wi ll not be disclosed to unauthorised third parties, and patient confidentiality  will 
be maintained at all times.
14Protocol Compliance
Lundbeck has a “no -waiver” policy , which means that permission will not be given to deviate 
from the protocol.
If deviations occur, the investigator must inform the CRA and they  must review, discuss, and 
document the implications of the deviation.
15Study Termination
Lundbeck or a pertinent regulatory  authorit y ma y terminate the study  or part of the study  at 
any time. The reasons for such action may  include, but are not limited to:
•safet y concerns
•proven lack of efficacy  of the IMP in other studies
If thestudy  is terminated or suspended, the investigator must promptly  inform the patients 
and ensure appropriate therapy  and follow -up. Furthermore, the investigator and/or sponsor 
must promptly  inform the IEC or IRB and provide a detailed written explanation. The 
pertinent regulatory  authorities must be informed in accordance with national regulations.

17Statistical Methodology
17.1 Responsibilities
The Department of Biostatistics, H.Lundbeck A/S will perform the statistical anal yses 
described below.
17.2 Analysis Sets
The following anal ysis sets are defined.
•all-patients- treated set (APTS) –all patients who took at least one dose of Lu AF35700 in 
study 16159B.
•full analy sis set (FAS) –all patients in the APTS who had at least one valid post baseline 
effectiveness assessment in study 16159B. 
The APTS will mainly  be used for presentations of safet y data whereas the FAS will be used 
for eff ectiveness data.
17.3 Descriptive Statistics
In gener al, summary  statistics (n, arithmetic mean, standard deviation, median, minimum and 
maximum values) will be presented for continuous variables and counts and, if relevant, 
percentages will be presented for categorical variables.
Forpatients coming from 16159A, summaries will be prepared with respect to two baselines: 
•Baseline I: Baseline just prior to randomisation in study 16159A (Baseline 2 in 16159A )
•Baseline II: Baseline in study 16159B. 
Unless otherwise specified, baseline will be Baseline II.
Summa ries will be prepared overall and b y the previous treatment (treatment group in the 
studies feeding into this extension study  or previous treatment for patients not included in any  
Lu AF35700 stud ybefore). In order not to have too many  “previous treatment s”, these will be 
grouped into the following categories:
•Lu AF 35700
•Risperidone/Olanzapine (16159A patients)
•Quetiapine 
•Previous treatment for patients not included in any L u AF35700 study  before

Confidential
Page 77of 87To explore the safet y and eff ectiveness of daily  dosing wit h Lu AF35700, separate display s 
will be prepared for patients only  receiving dail y dosing in this study .
17.4 Patient Disposition
Patient disposition will be summarised byreason for withdrawal and other relevant 
parameters andinclude the number of patients wh o completed and the number of patients who 
withdrew from the stud y.
17.5 Demographics and Other Baseline Characteristics
Demographics (sex, age, race), and other baseline cha racteristics will be summarised.
17.6 Recent and Concomitant Medication
Recent and concomita nt medication will be summarised by  anatomical therapeutic chemical 
(ATC) code and generic drug name.
17.7 Exposure and Compliance
Exposure and compliance will be calculated per patient and summarised.
In particular, the amount of weekl y dosing, frequency, dura tion, and reasons for initiation and 
termination, will be summarised.
17.8
Effectiveness Analyses
Effectiveness assessment will be summarised descriptively  using Observed Cases (OC).
Summaries will be performed with respect to both Baseline Iand Baseline II. On an 
exploratory  basis, the maintenance of effectiveness will be anal ysed using Mixed Models for 
Repeated Measurements (MMRM). 
Quality  of life, treatment satisfaction and health care resource utilization will be summarised.
Based on the FAS and observed c ases (OC), the effectiveness endpoints will be anal ysed 
using a mixed model for repeated measurements (MMRM) with an unstructured covariance 
structure. The model will include terms for country , baseline 1/2 score visit, and previous 
treatment.

Page 78of 8717.9 Safety Analyses
17.9.1 Analysis of Adverse Events
Adverse events will be classified according to the time of onset of the adverse event:
•pre-study adverse event –an adverse event that starts before the date of f irst dose of IMP 
in study 16159B.
•Treatment -emergent adverse ev ent(TEAE) –an adverse event that starts or increases in 
intensity  on or after the date of first dose of Lu AF35700 in study 16159B. 
Adverse events, sorted by  system organ class (SOC) and preferred term, will be summarised.
Specific tables of adverse eve nts after weekly dosing will be prepared. Display s of all events 
while on weekl y dosing, as well as events seen shortly  after initiation of weekl y dosing will 
be prepared.
Allocation of TEAEs to Treatment Periods
TEAEs may  be allocat ed into study  periods ( these will be defined in the Statistical Analysis 
Plan ).
Where relevant, Kaplan -Meier plots of time to TEAEs ,will be prepared.
17.9.2 Analysis of Other Safety Endpoints
The clinical safet y laboratory  test values, body  weight , BM I and waist circumference, vital 
signs, and ECG parameters will be summariz ed. Potentially  clinicall
y significant (PCS) 
values will be flagged and summariz ed.
Mean change from b aseline in AIMS, BARS and mSAS total scores will be summarized.
The C -SSRS will be summariz ed descriptivel y.
17.10 Interim Analyses
No interim anal yses are planned.
17.11 Sample Size and Power
No formal sample size calculation has been performed for the present stud y. 
Approximately  400 patients with schizophrenia are planned to be enrolled in total in order to 
provide relevant long-term safet y data. It is assumed that about 270 patients will come from 
study 16159A, 30 patients from study 16323A, and an additional 100 patients who need to 
change their antipsy chotic treatment will be included. The distribution of the number of 
patients may  be adjusted based upon the recruitment rate in each group. With approximately

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  5  Volunteers will be screened for study participation from Days -14 to -3 . After Screening on Day 1, 
eligible participants will be enrolled and will be randomized to receive one of two dosing sequences 
as presented in the table above. Once randomized, each participant will receive 2 doses of atropine separated by a wash out period of 6 ±1 days. During Visit 1 (Day 1) and Visit 2 (Day 8), participants 
will be administered SL or IM atropine, according to their randomly assigned dosing sequence . At 
each dosing v isit, blood samples for PK will be collected at time 0 (pre-dose) and at 13 time points 
post-dose at 5 , 10, 15, 20, 30, 45, 60, and 90 minutes and 2, 2.5, 4, 6, and 8 hours after dosing.  
Participants will be discharged from the clinic after the 8 -hour blood sample collection. Participants 
will be followed for approximately 6 days after their last dose.   
Number of participants (planned): Approximately 46 enrolled for 36 evaluable  
Diagnosis and main criteria for inclusion: Healthy male and non -pregnant female participants aged 
18 through 65  years, inclusive.  
Eligibility  criteria will be assessed at Screening and must be reviewed just prior to each dose of 
atropine . Criteria specified  as only being evaluated at Screening  or at Pre -dose Visits will be assessed 
only at those visits. If the participant no longer meets applicable eligibility criteria, the investigator, in 
consultation with the medical monitor in cases of uncertainty, must determine whether the participant 
should receive the atropine dose or be terminated early from study drug.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  8  Statistical methods: 
Analysis Plan Statistical analyses will be performed using SAS
® software Version 9.4 or later. Phoenix WinNonLin 
software Version 8.3 or later will be used to generate PK parameter estimates.  
Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize participant characteristics and safety. These 
summaries will be presented overall and separately for each route of administration.   
Pharmacokinetic parameter estimates will be summarized using descriptive statistics. Bioavailability 
of SL administration of atropine sulfate relative to that of IM atropine sulfate will be assessed based 
on ratios of least -square means and their associated 90% confidence intervals (CIs) generated from 
linear mixed models including terms for dosing sequence, route, and period as fixed effects, and subject nested within dosing sequence as a random effect. Bioequivalence will be considered met if the 90% CI o f the ratio for AUC
∞ and AUC t lie within 80.00 to 125.00%.     
Additional d etails of the statistical analyses, methods, and data conventions will be described in the 
Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP). 
Final Analyses   
A clinical study report will be written to include all PK and safety data collected throughout the study. 
For the final analysis, the study database will be monitored, cleaned, and locked per associated study plans . Further details will be specified in the SAP. 
Analysis Populations  
PK Analysis Population  
The PK analysis population will include all participants who are randomized, receive at least 1 study drug dose, and have PK samples collected for that period. Each participant’s data will be analyzed according to the corresponding route of administration  for the applicable period. The PK analysis 
population will be used for all PK analyses.  
Per Protocol Population  
The per protocol population will include all participants who are randomized, receive  atropine via  
both routes of administration according to the ir randomized dosing sequence, and have PK samples 
collected for both periods. In addition, participants with major protocol deviations may be excluded if 
it is determined that the deviations affect the integrity of PK data. Each participant’s data will be analyzed according to the corresponding route of administration for the applicable period. Primary 
and secondary analys es will be repeated in the per protocol population if it differs from the PK 
analysis population.  
Safety Population  
The safety population will include all participants who are randomized and receive at least 1 study drug dose. Each participant’s data will be analyzed according to the corresponding route of administration for the applicable period. The safety population will be used for all safety displays.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  17  5. INTRODUCTION  
5.1. Background 
The Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) is tasked with, 
among other things, promoting and supporting the development of strategic medical countermeasures (MCMs) for the United States. Typically, this effort involves supporting novel 
drug development up to Food and Drug Administration ( FDA) approval and inclusion into the 
Strategic National Stockpile. However, in the event of widespread nerve agent (NA) poisoning, 
pre-deployed MCMs are likely to be inadequate due to limited availability of community caches 
(Chempack), logistical challenges in bringing the resource s to the site of treatment, depletion of 
the resources before all patients needing treatment receive it, and expiration or unavailability of 
approved MCMs and/or preferred delivery devices (auto- injectors).
1  
In response to this challenge, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is investigating the bioavailability and pharmacokinetics ( PK) of an alternative (sublingual [SL] ) 
route of administration of a tropine s ulfate ophthalmic s olution (1%) compared with  the 
reference, atropine s ulfate injected  intramuscularly ( IM).
2  
Atropine is an approved drug indicated for temporary blockade of severe or life-threatening muscarinic effects, symptomatic bradycardia, and to dilate the pupils to facilitate eye exams. 
Atropine is an antidote for organophosphorus or carbamate chemical warfare agent or pesticide 
poisoning, as well as the treatment of some (muscarinic) mushroom toxicity. Atropine  is 
available in multiple dosing forms  and is commonly administered by IM injection, intravenous 
(IV) injection, and as ocular drops. The ocular drop formulation is also given off- label SL for 
excessive drooling in multiple contexts , including maintenance of perioral hygiene in hospice 
patients, to alleviate hypersalivation caused by certain antipsychotic medications, to manage oral 
secretions/reduce ventilator-associated pneumonia risk in mechanically ventilated patients, and 
for excessive drooling in developmentally dis abled children.
3-6 
This randomized, open-label, two -period, two-sequence, phase 1 study is designed to assess the 
bioequivalence, bioavailabi lity, and PK  of SL administered Atropine S ulfate Ophthalmic 
Solution, United States Pharmacopeia ( USP) 1% (1 mg; test)  compared to Atropine S ulfate 
Injection , USP  administered IM (1 mg; reference) in healthy adult volunteers. 
5.2. Study Rationale  
Nerve agent toxicity requires the rapid administration of antimuscarinic MCMs to mitigate life -
threatening bronchorrhea and seizures. Rapid administration of centrally acting doses of atropine 
and anticholinergic medications are most effective within 10 minutes of administration. 
Following IV administration of atropine, the heart rate increases with in seconds, and the 
antisialagogue and central nervous system effects may take a few minutes to achieve maximum 
effect. In contrast, the  IM route of atropine adm inistration requires a very high dose before 
central antimuscarinic effects are seen, and the onset of action is delayed. Further, stockpiled NA 
MCM configurations (Chempack), containing drugs administered by auto- injector, are 
insufficient to treat large numbers of NA -poisoned patients in a timely manner. Ophthalmic 
atropine solution is generally available in the community and may provide a rapid, available source of effective medication in the event of an emergency.

Protocol BP-C-24-0001  Version 1.0  13 February  2024 
 
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  18  Administration of atropine s ulfate ophthalmic solution via the SL route may be an alternative 
means of delivering a rapid therapeutic dose of atropine to individuals exposed to NA while  
overcoming the stockpile supply deficits identified above.  
The purpose of the current study is to assess the bioequivalence, bioavailability , and PK  of SL 
administered Atropine S ulfate O phthalmic Solution, USP 1% compared to Atropine S ulfate 
Injection , USP  administered IM  in healthy adult volunteers . 
5.3. Previous Clinical Studies  
Prior to conducting study BP-C-19010 (Study Registry ID: [REMOVED])8, BARDA 
conducted an extensive literature review and identified 110 published English language articles 
involving the administration of atropine by SL, nasal, and oral routes. Eighteen studies were selected based on their relevance to the proposed clinical study and are summarized in 
Appendix 1. Included among these reports are 6 wherein hyoscyamine, the levo-enantiomer of 
atropine, was the active agent. A total of 470 participants were exposed to varying doses and regimens of SL atropine, including the ophthalmic formulation, or hyoscyamine in these reports. 
In several reports, atropine was administered SL on a regular regimen versus the single dose per timepoint as proposed in this study. No severe adverse reactions were reported, and the side effects observed were consistent with known anticholinergic effects previously observed with 
oral or parenteral adm inistration, e.g., dry mouth. In one study of children in Brazil with cerebral 
palsy and drooling, side effects occurred in 4 of 33 (12%) patients. These side effects and their 
respective frequency were as follows: fever and flush (1), irritability (1), flush and irritability (1) 
and flush and angioedema (1).
5 Further characterization of these events was not provided. 
Norderyd et al. prospectively studied the effect of SL atropine in children and adolescents 5 
through 18 years old with disabilities and excessive salivation (n  = 23). During the course of the 
study, 1064 person-doses of atropine were administered to children without any reported adverse 
events (AEs).3 
A study of SL injection of atropine is included here since it is a useful evaluation of atropine PK, 
and the atropine dose used was two-fold greater than the 1 mg dose to be used in the current 
study. Rajpal et al. evaluated 9 healthy male volunteers (mean age 20.8 ± 4.7 years, mean weight 59.67 ± 4.76 kg) administered a single SL injection of 2 mg atropine sulfate (in 0.1 mL).
7 Three 
of the participants had 99mTc- labeled diethylene triamine pentaacetic acid added to their 
injection to monitor the release r ate of atropine sulfate. Within 10 minutes, 85% of the injected 
dose was released from the SL site of injection. This compared to only 24% released at 10 
minutes from one participant who received IM atropine. The remaining six participants 
underwent blood sampling for PK and clinical monitoring for signs of atropinization (heart rate, 
pupil diameter, and mouth dryness). The peak serum concentration of SL atropine was 20 ng/mL 
at 15 minutes compared to peak serum concentrations of 6 to 8 ng/mL at 30 minutes following 
IM administration. All volunteers who received atropine by SL injection showed signs of 
atropinization by 10 minutes with peak intensity at 30 minutes and persistence of symptoms for 
nearly 60 minutes. The authors concluded that atropine administered by SL  injection achieves 
clinically important serum levels more rapidly than by IM  administration. Adverse events were 
not reported in this trial.  
BARDA conducted, BP -C-19010, a randomized, 3- sequence, 3 -period phase I crossover study to 
assess the bioavailability and  PK of a single dose (0.5 mg and 1.0 mg) of 1% ophthalmic

Protocol BP-C-24-0001  Version 1.0  13 February  2024 
 
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  19  atropine sulfate solution administered SL to 15 healthy adult volunteers.8,9 The primary endpoint 
was evaluation of the bioavailability of each of the two SL doses against a 1.0 mg reference IV 
atropine dose. Secondary endpoints included the safety and tolerability (xerostomia scale) of 
atropine sulfate administered SL. Sublingual atropine was safe (no severe AEs or serious adverse events [ SAEs ] were reported with either dose) and well tolerated, with a single participant 
reaching maximum xerostomia on a single dosing day. The geometric mean AUC
∞ was 286.40, 
493.81, and 816.47 min×ng/mL for the 0.5 mg and 1.0 mg SL doses and the 1.0 mg IV dose, respectively. Compared to IV administration, the 1.0 mg SL dose produced 0.60 (90% CI: 0.55-
0.66) of the overall concentration of atropine over time ( AUC
∞). 
Based on the reported experience to date, the administration of atropine via the SL route appears 
to have an acceptable safety profile and does not significantly increase the risk associated with 
the use of the drug product as proposed.

7.1. Overall Study Design 
This is a randomized, open -label, two -period, two-sequence, crossover study to assess the 
bioequivalence, bioavailability , and PK of a single dose of atropine administered SL or IM in 
healthy adult volunteers. Approximately 46 healthy male and non-pregnant female volunteers 
will be enrolled to obtain approximately 36 evaluable participants  in the per protocol population. 
Additional participants may be randomized if participants are withdrawn prior to receiving one 
or both doses of study drug. Eligible participants will be randomized at a 1:1 ratio to receive one 
of two treatment dosing s equences (A or B) as depicted in Table  3.

Figure 1 presents a diagram of the overall study design. Volunteers will be screened for study 
participation  from Days -14 to -3. After Screening on Day 1, eligible participants will be  enrolled 
and will be randomized to one of two treatment dosing sequences as presented in Table  3. Once 
randomized, each participant will receive 2 doses of atropine separated by a wash out period of 6 ±1 days. During Visit 1 (Day 1 ) and Visit 2 (Day 8 ), participants will be administered SL or IM 
atropine, according to the ir randomly assigned dosing sequence. At each dosing visit, blood 
samples for PK will be collected at time 0 (pre -dose) and at 13 time points post- dose at 5, 10, 15, 
20, 30, 45, 60, and 90 minutes and 2, 2.5, 4, 6, and 8 hour s after dosing. Participants  will be 
discharged from the clinic after the 8 -hour blood sample collection. Participants will be followed 
for approximately  6 days after their last dose.  
At the Screening Visit, p articipants will receive instructions regarding  preparation for dosing 
visits, and information about conduct during dosing visits. On the day of atropine administration, 
site staff will review eligibility  criteria with each participant  (except  for those criteria specified 
as only being applicable at S creening; see Section  8.1). In addition to meeting eligibility criteria, 
participants will not be dosed with study drug until they  meet the  following pre-dose 
requirement s:  
1. Have fasted from  food and  drink for 2 hours prior to drug administration . 
2. Have abstained from any other oral product that has the potential to interfere with SL 
atropine  absorption (e.g., candy, chewing gum, mints, etc.) for 2 hours prior to study drug 
administration . 
Following administration of study drug, participants:  
1. Will abstain from food and  drink through 2 hours after drug  administration  or until the 
participant expresses their xerostomia is intolerable, whichever occurs first.  After 2

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  23  • Participant  experiences an AE that, in the opinion of the investigator, makes further 
dosing inadvisable because the AE causes functional impairment or because the AE 
requires a medical intervention or observation for safety.  
• Participant  no longer meets eligibility criteria in such a way that, in the judgment of 
the investigator, the safety of the participant may be compromised by continued participation or interpretation of the participant ’s subsequent study data are likely to 
be significantly compromised.  
Once a participant has been reviewed by the medical monitor and the BARDA Pharmacovigilance SME  and/or BARDA Medical Officer , they will recommend to either (1) 
continue dosing per the protocol or (2) discontinue further dosing of the participant.   
Participant s who do not complete both study drug doses for any reason will continue to be 
followed for safety for at least six days following the last dose. If a  participant reports an AE 
judged at least possibly related to study drug, the event will be followed to resolution (with or 
without sequelae) or until considered stable by the investigator (in consultation with the medical 
monitor in situations of uncertainty ).  
The reason for early discontinuation of dosing will be captured in the electronic case report form 
(eCRF ).   
7.4.2. Study Pausing Rules  
If the following criterion is met, further dosing of all participants will be paused.  
• Two or more participants experience a grade 3 or higher AE in the same Medical 
Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) system organ class deemed at least 
possibly related to the study drug by the site investigator in consultation with the medical 
monitor. 
• One grade 5 AE (death) deemed at least possibly related to the study drug by the site investigator in consultation with the medical monitor.  
At that time, the medical monitor, and the BARDA Pharmacovigilance SME  and/or BARDA 
Medical Officer will convene to discuss and review these cases. The site investigator may be present at these meetings to provide additional information. After this review, it may be decided 
to either continue to pause dosing pending review of additional data, resume dosing as specified in the protocol, modify the study, or terminate the study. As the trial sponsor, BARDA will make 
the final decision.  
7.5. Criteria for Study Suspension or Termination  
BARDA retains the right to suspend, modify, or terminate  the study at any time. In case of 
premature termination or suspension and safety review of the study, Allucent will promptly 
inform the investigator of the termination or suspension of the study and the reason for termination or suspension, and the clinical site will inform the institutional review board (IRB).  
This study may be prematurely terminated if there is sufficient reasonable cause, including but not limited to: 
1. Determination of unexpected, significant, or unacceptable risk to participants

8.1. Selection of Study Population 
This study will include all healthy adult male and non- pregnant female participants, between the 
ages of 18 and 65 years, inclusive, who meet all of the inclusion and none of the exclusion 
criteria.  Eligibility criteria will be assessed at Screening and must be reviewed just prior to each 
dose of atropine. Criteria  specified as only being evaluated  at Screening  or at Pre -dose Visits will 
be assessed only at those visits. I f the participant  no longer meets applicable eligibility criteria, 
the investigator, in consultation with the medical monitor in cases of uncertainty, must determine 
whether the participant  should receive the atropine dose or be terminated early from study drug.  
Deviations from the inclusion and exclusion criteria are not allowed because they can potentially 
jeopardize the scientific integrity of the study or participant  safety. Therefore, adherence to the 
criteria specified in the protocol is essential.  
8.1.1. Participant Inclusion Criteria

9.2. Concomitant Medications  
Any treatment, including all prescription drugs, herbal products, vitamins, minerals, and over-
the-counter (OTC) medications administered from the time of consent through the end of study 
participation, is considered a concomitant medication. Concomitant medication use will be 
recorded in the eCRF and will include the medication name, dose, frequency, route of 
administration, and the dates of administration. Concomitant therapies will also be recorded on 
the applicable eCRF. Any changes, additions, and/or deletions in c oncomitant medications or 
therapies will be recorded in the participant’s eCRF throughout the course of the participant’s 
participation in the study.  
If it is discovered that a participant is using a prohibited concomitant medication after he or she 
is enrolled in the study, the site investigator, in consultation with the medical monitor in cases of 
uncertainty, should determine the impact on the participant’s participation. All instances of use 
of prohibited concomitant medications or therapies must be documented. 
9.2.1. Prohibited and Permitted Concomitant Medication s  
The following concomitant medications are allowed during study participation :  
• Contraceptive medications and estrogen or estrogen/progesterone hormone 
replacement therapy are permitted for female participants.  
• Nonsteroidal anti- inflammatory drugs and acetaminophen are permitted for all 
participants.  
Except for the permitted medications listed above, all other concomitant medications are prohibited from Screening until the end of study participation  (i.e., after the Telephone Follow-

to Screening , and prohibited until the  end of study participation . All over- the-counter 
medications, vitamins, and  herbal supplements are exclusionary if taken within  72 hours prior to  
Screening , and prohibited until the end of study participation. 
9.3. Treatment Compliance 
The study drug will be administered by an unblinded study staff member and thus is an observed 
compliance. Participant  compliance will be determined by the number and percentage of 
participant s who receive study drug at Visits 1 and  2 by dosing sequence. Any deviations from 
the dosing schedule outside the defined visit windows ( Appendix 2) must be approved by 
BARDA and will be recorded .

10.1. Study Drug  
Refer to Section 9.1 for detailed information regarding Atropine S ulfate Ophthalmic Solution, 
USP 1% and Atropine S ulfate  Injection , USP . 
10.2. Study Drug Packaging and Labeling 
Study drug will be packaged and labeled according to applicable local and regulatory 
requirements.  
10.3. Study Drug Storage 
Study drug must be stored in a secure area (e.g., a locked room or locked cabinet), and protected from light and moisture. Atropine S ulfate Ophthalmic Solution, USP 1% and Atropine S ulfate 
Injection , USP  should be kept at controlled room temperature between 20° and 25°C (68° to 
77°F), inclusive. Atropine S ulfate Ophthalmic  Solution, USP 1% is p rovided as 5 single-dose 
vials in foil pouches; vials should be stored as packaged until use. The temperature of the storage 
unit must be monitored , and documentation of proper storage must be maintained.   
10.4. Study Drug Preparation and Administration  
Study drug will be visually inspected for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit; it should not be administered if either 
condition exists. Study drug will not be administered if the seal is not intact immediately prior to 
taking the initial dose from each vial.  
For SL administration, 100 μL of Atropine S ulfate Ophthalmic Solution, USP 1% will be 
administered SL by pipette to deliver 1.0 mg of atropine sulfate. Before administration of SL 
atropine, participants will be asked to swallow. Following administration, participants will be 
instructed to attempt not to swallow for 30 seconds and thereafter swallow as they normally 
would. Atropine S ulfate Ophthalmic Solution, USP 1% for SL administration will be provided in 
0.4 mL  single-dose vials , and each vial of atropine will only be used to administer a single dose.  
For IM administration, 2.5 mL of Atropine S ulfa
 te Injection, USP (8 mg/20 mL; 0.4 mg/mL) 
will be injected into the mid -anterolateral thigh to deliver 1.0 mg of atropine sulfate. Appropriate 
needle length for IM administration depends on age and body mass of the participant. The needle 
length should be sufficient  to reach the muscle mass and prevent the atropine dose from seeping 
into subcutaneous tissue, but not so long as to involve underlying nerves, blood vessels, or bone. 
For most adults receiving an in tramuscular administration in the anterolateral thigh, a 1 -1.5" 
needle inserted at a 90- degree angle to the skin should be utilized to ensure the IM dose is 
administered appropriately . Atropine S ulfate I njection, USP will be supplied in multi -dose vials. 
Multi -dose vial s for IM administration will be dated and timed in the appropriate label areas 
upon initial puncture to indicate the first time of entry into the vial. No dose shall be 
administered from the opened vial after 24 hours of first entry  (i.e., the beyond use date/time) . 
After initial use of single -dose vials for SL administration, or after the beyond use date/time of 
multi- dose vials for IM administration, the used vials should be maintained in a separate location 
from the unused vials until drug accountability has been reconciled.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  35  12. ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY  
12.1. Safety Parameters  
Safety will be evaluated utilizing the assessments defined in this section. If deemed clinically 
necessary, additional safety assessments not currently specified in the protocol may be performed at the discretion of the site investigator in consultation with the medical monitor and 
BARDA.  
12.1.1. Demographic/Medical History  
In order to define a baseline for potential AEs, the demographics and medical history of each 
participant  will be collected at the Screening Visit.  
12.1.2. Vital Signs  
Vital sign measurements, including oral temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, and diastolic and systolic blood pressure (after the participant  is seated for at least 5 minutes), will be 
collected at Screening, Visit 1 (Day 1 Pre -dose), and Visit 2 (Day 8 Pre -dose) prior to any blood 
draws. Post- dose automated blood pressure and heart rate measurements will be recorded on the 
opposite arm from blood collection every 15 ± 5 minutes for the first hour, every 20 ± 5 minutes 
for the second hour, and every 30 ± 5  minutes for the third and fourth hours and thereafter as 
deemed clinically necessary by the investigator until the end of each visit. Vital signs may be repeated at an Unscheduled or Early Termination (ET) Visit per the investigator’s discretion.  
Respiratory rate, if regular, may be assessed over 30 seconds and doubled, but in no case will it 
be assessed over a period of less than 30 seconds. If the respiratory rate is irregular, it will be 
assessed over 60 seconds.  
12.1.3. Weight and Height  
Participant ’s height and weight will be measured at the Screening Visit . Body mass index (BMI) 
will be derived  automatically  from height and weight measurements in the electronic data 
capture system.  Participant’s weight will be assessed  again at Visit 1 (Day 1 Pre -dose) and Visit 
2 (Day 8 Pre-dose). Weight may be measured at an Unscheduled or ET Visit per the 
investigator’s discretion.  
12.1.4. Physical Examination  
A physical examination will be performed at the Screening Visit to assess and confirm 
eligibility. The examination will include a general assessment of the skin, head, ears, eyes, nose, 
throat, neck, oral cavity, thyroid, lungs, heart, abdomen, lymph nodes, and musculoskeletal 
system/extremities, and a neurological (cranial nerve examination, including pupillary diameter, eye movements, and deep tendon reflexes) examination. A symptom-based physical examination 
may be performed at dosing visits, or at an Un scheduled or ET Visit per the investigator’s 
discretion.  In general, clinically significant abnormal findings are expected to be associated with 
an item recorded in the participant’s medical history (when detected at Screening) or as an AE (when detected after Screening).

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  36  12.1.5. Electrocardiogram (ECG)  
A standard 12- lead ECG will be recorded and assessed at the Screening Visit , Visit 1 (Day 1 Pre -
dose), and Visit 2 (Day 2 Pre-dose). Additionally, an ECG may  be performed for any complaints 
of chest discomfort, lightheadedness, and/or palpitations per the investigator’s discretion  and 
repeated as needed  during Visit 1 (Day 1 Post-dose) and Visit 2 (Day 2 Post-dose) . ECGs may 
also be performed at an Unscheduled or ET Visit per the investigator’s discretion. ECGs will be 
reviewed by a medically qualified indi vidual to verify whether any abnormalities are clinically 
significant. In general, clinically significant abnormal ECGs are expected to be associated with 
an item recorded in the participant’s medical history (when detected at Screening) or as an AE 
(when detected after Screening).    
12.1.6. Clinical Laboratory Assessments  
At the Screening Visit, v enous blood and urine will be collected for all participants for Screening 
laboratory a ssessments. All clinical laboratory assessments provided in this section  will be 
performed at Screening.  
Clinical laboratory assessments may be repeated at an Unscheduled or ET Visit as clinically 
indicated per the investigator’s discretion.  
Samples will be analyzed by the local lab. The details for sample handling, processing, and 
shipping will be provided in the Laboratory Manual. Individual results will be sent to the clinical site, and the investigator will perform a clinical assessment of all laboratory data to assess

gonadotropin (beta- HCG) assay for female participant s of childbearing potential. At Visit 1 (Day 
1 Pre -dose) and Visit 2 (Day 8 Pre -dose), a urine point- of-care (POC)  pregnancy test will be 
performed onsite for female participant s of childbearing potential.   
Additionally, a urine POC  pregnancy test will  be performed at any time during study 
participation if pregnancy is suspected.   
12.1.7. Adverse Event Assessment  
At all visits and phone contacts, including an ET or Unscheduled Visit, site staff will ask 
nonleading questions regarding the participant’s health status (Section 12.3.1) and document any 
new or changed AEs. Adverse events occurring during washout periods (i.e., between Visit 1 and Visit 2, and between Visit 2 and the Telephone Follow-up V isit) should be collected at the next 
participant contact.  
12.1.8. Concomitant Medication Assessment  
Site staff will review concomitant medications ( Section 9.2 ) at Screening, as well as Visit 1 (Day 
1 Pre -dose) and Visit 2 (Day 8 Pre- dose)  prior to administration of study drug. On  Visit 1 (Day 1

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  38  participant during attendance at the Clinical Research Unit ( CRU) will also be recorded. 
Concomitant medications will also be reviewed during the Follow-Up telephone contact and at 
an Unscheduled or ET Visit.  
12.2. Adverse and Serious Adverse Events 
12.2.1. Definition of Adverse Events  
12.2.1.1. Adverse Event (AE)  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether or not it is considered drug related [21 Code of Federal Regulations [CFR] 312.32(a)]. An AE 
can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) 
product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product (Integrated Addendum 
to International Council for  Harmonisation [ICH] E6[R1]: Guideline for Good Clinical Practice 
[GCP] E6[R2]).  
Laboratory results and vital sign excursions of any magnitude will be defined as AEs if they are considered clinically significant by the site investigator. A lab or vital sign result should generally be considered clinically significant and an AE if, regardless of degree out of range, it 
has a reasonable probability of reflecting or contributing to a disturbance of homeostasis or 
pathological pr ocess or outcome.  
Suspected adverse reaction (SAR) means any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that 
the drug caused the event. For the purposes of safety reporting, “reasonable possibility” means 
there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the dr ug and the AE. A SAR implies a 
lesser degree of certainty about causality than adverse reaction, which means any AE  caused by a 
drug [21 CFR 312.32(a)]. 
An AE or SAR is considered “unexpected” if it is not listed in the package inserts for the study 
drugs or is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed. 
12.2.1.2. Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
An AE or SAR is considered “serious” if, in the view of either the site investigator or  BAR DA, it 
results in any of the following outcomes [21 CFR 312.32(a)]: 
• Death  
• Life-threatening adverse event that in the view of the site investigator or BARDA, places 
the participant at immediate risk of death. This does not, however, include an event that, 
had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death. 
• Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongs existing hospitalization. Planned hospitalizations will not be reported as  SAEs unless categorized as medically important. 
Emergency room visits and observational admissions of under 24 hours, in themselves, 
do not qualify as SAEs. 
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity or substantial disruption of the 
ability to conduct normal life functions.  
HHS/ASPR/BARDA   SABER  
Protocol BP-C-24-0001  Version 1.0  13 February  2024 
 
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  39  • Congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
• Important medical events that may not result in death, be life threatening, or require 
hospitalization may be considered a serious adverse drug experience, when based on 
appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the participant, or the participant may 
require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this 
definition.  
12.3. Collection, Recording, and Grading Severity of Adverse Events 
12.3.1. Collection of Adverse Events  
Adverse events of any type described above may be discovered through a variety of methods: 
• Observing the participant 
• Questioning the participant with standard nonleading questions to elicit any medically 
related changes in their well -being (e.g., Have you been hospitalized, had any 
accidents, used any new medications, or changed any medications [both prescription and OTC]?)  
• Receiving an unsolicited complaint from the participant 
• An abnormal value or result from a clinical (e.g., vital signs) or laboratory evaluation  
12.3.2. Recording Adverse Events  
Throughout the study, the investigator will record AEs on the eCRF. SAEs must be reported to Rho pharmacovigilance personnel within 1 business day of the site’s awareness of the event. For 
the purposes of this study, any detrimental change in the participant ’s condition after signing 
informed consent and up to completion of the follow- up period after the last administration of 
study drug (i.e. , through Follow-up [ Day 15]) will be considered an AE and must be recorded. 
Treatment -emergent AEs are defined as A Es occurring after the participant receives at least one 
dose of atropine. AEs will be followed per the below criteria: 
• AEs judged at least possibly related to study drug will be followed to resolution (with or without sequelae) or until considered stable by the investigator (in consultation with the 
medical monitor in situations of uncertainty ).  
• AEs judged unrelated to study drug will be followed to resolution (with or without 
sequelae) or, if not resolving, until considered stable by the investigator (in consultation 
with the medical monitor in situations of uncertainty ), or until the end of the participant’s 
study participation, whichever comes first.  
12.3.3. Grading Severity of Adverse Events 
The severity of AEs and SAEs will be graded as defined by criteria set forth in the NCI- CTCAE 
Manual Version 5.0. AEs will be graded on a scale from 1 to 5 according to the following 
standards in the NCI -CTCAE manual:  
Grade 1 = mild AE 
Grade 2 = moderate AE

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  41  the possible effects on the fetus. Monitoring of the pregnant participant shall continue until the 
conclusion of the pregnancy.  
The pregnancy will be documented when identified and at its conclusion.  
Should pregnancy result in a congenital abnormality, birth defect, miscarriage, or medically 
indicated abortion, an SAE must be submitted to Rho using the SAE reporting procedures 
described in Section 12.3.2.  
12.7. Reporting Other Safety Information  
Site investigators should promptly notify Rho, Allucent, BARDA, and the IRB when an unanticipated problem involving risks to participants or others, which is not otherwise reportable 
as an AE, is identified.

13.1.1. Measures to Minimize Bias 
Permuted block randomization will be performed centrally by designated Rho staff and will 
balance enrollment between treatment dosing sequences (see Section 10.7 for more details). 
13.1.2. Analysis Plan 
Statistical analyses will be performed using SAS® software Version 9. 4 or later. Phoenix 
WinNonLin Version 8.3 software will be used to generate PK parameter estimates.  
Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize participant  characteristics and safety. These 
summaries will be presented overall and separately for each route of administration .   
Details of the statistical analyses, methods, and data conventions will be described in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).  
13.1.2.1. Analysis Populations  
13.1.2.1.1. PK Analysis Population

PK analysis population will be used for all PK analyses.  
13.1.2.1.2. Per Protocol Population 
The per protocol population will include all participants who are randomized, receive atropine 
via both routes of administration  according to the ir randomized dosing sequence, and have PK 
samples collected for both periods. In addition, participants with major protocol deviations may 
be excluded if it is determined that the deviations affect the integrity of PK data. Each 
participant ’s data will be analyzed according to the corresponding route of administration  for the 
applicable period . Primary and secondary analys es will be repeated in the per protocol 
population if it differs from the PK analysis population. 
13.1.2.1.3. Safety Population 
The safety population will include all participants who are randomized and receive at least 1 
study drug dose. Each participant’s data will be analyzed according to the corresponding route of 
administration for the applicable period.  The safety population will be used for all safety 
displays. 
13.1.2.2. Primary Analysis 
Pharmacokinetic parameter s AUC ∞ and AUC t will be estimated for each participant and route 
using the noncompartmental method and will be summarized by route of administration using 
descriptive statistics.  
Relative bioavailability of SL administration of atropine sulfate compared  to that of IM atropine 
sulfate will be assessed based on ratios of least -square means and their associated 90% 
confidence intervals (CIs) generated from linear mixed models including terms for dosing 
sequence, route, and period as fixed effects, and subject nested within dosing sequence as a 
random effect. Bioequivalence will be considered met if the 90% CI of the ratio for AUC ∞ and 
AUC t lie within 80.00 and 125.00%.  
Additional details of the statistical analyses, methods, and data conventions will be described in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).

A clinical study report will be written to include all PK  and safety data collected throughout the 
study. For the final analysis, the study database will be monitored, cleaned, and locked per 
associated study plans . Further details will be specified in the SAP.  
13.1.2.6. Exploratory Analyses  
No exploratory analyses are planned. 
13.2. Sample Size Considerations  
The target sample size for randomization for this study is approximately  46 participant s, 
allowing for a 20% dropout rate that would result in approximately 36 evaluable participant s 
(approximately 18 per dosing sequence) within the per protocol population. Additional participants may be randomized if participants are withdrawn prior to receiving one or both 
doses of study drug (Section  8.2.2).   
The sample size was determined for an equivalence test of the ratio of means using two one-
sided tests on data from a two -period cross-over design. In the previous PK study of SL 
administration of atropine (BP -C-19010),
8 the standard deviation for the dose-adjusted log10 
difference in high (1.0 mg) versus low (0.5 mg) SL dosing for AUC ∞ and C max were 0.102 and 
0.146, respectively. Since the intra- participant  variability in PK parameters between SL and IM 
administration is unknown, the standard deviations we re conservatively multiplied by a factor of 
1.25 to determine power and sample size for this study. Corresponding coefficients of variance were estimated as 0.212 and 0.304 for AUC
∞ and C max, respectively. A sample size of 36 
achieves greater than 99% power to test bioequivalence for AUC ∞ and 86% power for C max at the 
0.05 significance level when the true ratio of means is 1.0 and the equivalence limits are 0.80 and 1.25. Even if the true ratio of means are within ±5% of 1.0, the study still maintains 96% and 
77% power for AUC
∞ and C max, respectively.  
13.3. Statistical Considerations  
13.3.1. Covariates 
Due to the small sample size and cross-over design of this study, analyses adjusted for additional 
covariates beyond those specified for the primary analysis are not planned. 
13.3.2. Multicenter Studies  
This is a single center study  thus study data will be analyzed as a whole.  
13.3.3. Multiple Comparisons and Multiplicity  
No adjustments will be made for multiple comparisons.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  47  15. QUALITY CONTROL AND QU ALITY ASSURANCE  
Quality assurance (QA) includes all the planned and systematic actions that are established to 
ensure that the clinical study is performed , and the data are generated, documented (recorded), 
and reported according to International Council for  Harmoni sation ( ICH) Good Clinical Practice 
(GCP ) and local/regional regulatory standards.  
To ensure the reliability of study data, the participating site(s) will have a plan in place to 
describe:  
• routine internal quality control (QC) and QA activities for the purposes of measuring, 
documenting and reporting study conduct, protocol adherence, human subjects’ 
protections, and reliability of the protocol- driven data collected;  
• a process for addressing in a timely manner any data quality issues (i.e., collecting, 
recording and reporting data), systemic issues (i.e., protocol conduct, non-
compliance, human subject protections), and implementation of corrective and preventative action ( CAPA) procedures.  
A quality assurance representative from BARDA (or designee), who is independent of and separated from routine monitoring, may periodically arrange audits of the clinical study by reviewing the data obtained and procedural aspects. These audits may include on site or remote 
audits and source data checks. Direct access to source documents is required for the purpose of 
these periodic audits.  
15.1. Data Quality Assurance  
Data collected at the study site will be entered accurately and contemporaneously by study staff into a 21 CFR 11-compliant, internet- based, remote data entry system, which is backed up 
nightly. Data will be provided using the participant’s unique identification number, not name or 
initials; Rho will not collect personally identifying information such as the participant’s name or 
social security number. Participants will provide demographic information such as biological sex 
at birth, race, ethnicity, and age . All elements of data entry (e.g., time, date, verbatim text, and 
the person performing the data entry) will be recorded within the remote data entry system’s audit trail to allow all data changes in the database to be monitored and maintained in accordance with federal regulations. Data collected by the laboratories will be transferred electronically 
directly from the laboratory to Rho using standard s ecure data transfer procedures. The analysis 
datasets will incorporate data from both sources. Data col lected by Rho will be held in the 
strictest confidence and are protected from access that could reveal personal information  about 
any participant in the study. 
Clinical data management and data cleaning procedures (e.g., resolving errors and 
inconsistencies in the data) will be performed in accordance with applicable Rho and/or BARDA 
standards and validation plans to ensure the integrity of the data. Adverse events (including 
SAEs) and concomitant medication terms will be coded using the MedDRA and the World Health Organization  Drug dictionaries, respectively.  
After study monitors verify the data and prior to the final study analysis, the investigator must sign each eCRF at the participant level to confirm the integrity of the  data recorded.  
HHS/ASPR/BARDA   SABER  
Protocol BP-C-24-0001  Version 1.0  13 February  2024 
 
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  48  After database lock, the study site will receive an electronic copy of all of their site- specific 
eCRF data as entered into the remote data entry system for the study, including full discrepancy 
and audit history. Additionally, all of the study’s analysis datasets will be sent to BARDA 
electronically for storage. Rho will maintain a duplicate copy for its records  and will upload a 
copy to the BARDA Clinical Studies Network (CSN) archive . 
15.2. Study Monitoring  
Site monitoring is conducted to ensure that the rights and well- being of trial participants are 
protected, that the reported trial data are accurate, complete, and verifiable, and that the conduct 
of the trial is in compliance with the currently IRB/IEC ap proved protocol/amendment(s), ICH 
GCP, and applicable regulatory requirement(s). Clinical monitoring also verifies any critical 
study procedures are completed following specific instructions in ancillary documents referenced 
in the protocol. 
Monitoring for this study will be performed by BARDA’s authorized representatives at Allucent . 
Details of clinical site monitoring are documented in a monitoring plan. The monitoring plan 
describes in detail who will conduct the monitoring, at what frequency monitoring will be done, 
at what level of detail monitoring will be performed, and the distribution of monitoring reports. Monitoring visits will include, but are not limited to, review  of regulatory files, accountability 
records, eCRFs, ICFs , medical a nd laboratory reports, site study drug storage records, training 
records, and protocol and GCP compliance. Site monitors will have access to the participating site facilities , study personnel, and all study documentation according to the monitoring plan. 
Study monitors will meet with site investigators to discuss any problems and outstanding issues, and will document site visit findings and discussions. 
15.3. Protocol Deviations 
15.3.1. Protocol Deviation Definition  
A protocol deviation is any noncompliance with the IRB-approved study protocol, ICH GCP guidelines, or protocol- specific M anual (s) of P rocedures (MOP s). Any deviation that affects the 
rights or safety of the participant or the integrity of the data will be considered a major protocol 
deviation. Prospective permission to deviate from protocol requirements , also known as protocol 
waivers or exemptions, will not be granted for this study.  
15.3.2. Reporting and Managing Deviations 
The site investigator has the responsibility to identify, document, and report deviations. Protocol 
deviations may also be identified during site monitoring visits or during other forms of study 
conduct review. All deviations, regardless of the cause, must be docum ented in accordance with 
GCP . Documentation at a minimum, will include the date the deviation occurred, the date it was 
identified, a description of the deviation, whether the deviation resulted in an AE or SAE , and 
documentation of a corrective action plan. In addition, the site investigator will report noncompliance to the IRB /IEC , as applicable.  
Rho, Allucent, and/or BARDA may request discussion with the site investigator to determine the effect of any major protocol deviation on a study participant and his/her further study 
participation, the effect of the deviation on the overall study, and corrective actions.

 a Washouts of 6 ±  1 days  will occur  between visits. A dverse event s and concomitant medications will be recorded for both washout periods.  
b The ET Visit may be conducted in clinic or by phone as determined by the investigator.  
c Eligibility criteria must be reviewed just prior to each dose of atropine, unless the criterion is specified as only being ev aluated at Screening.  
d Weight only will be measured at Visit 1 (Day 1 Pre -dose) and Visit 2 (Day 8 Pre -dose). Weight may also be measured at an ET or U nscheduled Visit per the 
investigator’s discretion.  
e All participants  will undergo a physical examination at Screening. The examination will include a general assessment of the skin, head, ears, eyes, nose, throat, 
neck, oral cavity, thyroid, lungs, heart, abdomen, lymph nodes, and musculoskeletal system/extremities, and a neurological (cranial nerve examination, 
including pupillary diameter, eye movements, and deep tendon reflexes) examination . 
f At Visit 1 (Day 1 Pre -dose), Visit 2 (Day 8 Pre -dose), ET, and Unscheduled visits, the investigator may perform symptom -based physical examinations at their 
discretion.  
g Vital signs (heart rate, blood pressure, temperature, and respiratory rate) will be obtained prior to each dose of study drug . Post -dose automated blood pressure 
and heart rate measurements will be recorded on the opposite arm from blood collection every 1 5 ± 5 minutes for the first hour, every 20 ± 5 minutes for the 
second hour, and every 30 ± 5 minutes for the third and fourth hours , and thereafter as deemed clinically necessary by the investigator until the end of each 
visit. Vital signs may also be performed at an Unscheduled  or ET Visit per the investigator’s discretion.  
h At Visit 1 (Post- dose) and Visit 2 (Post- dose), an ECG may be performed for any complaints of chest discomfort, lightheadedness, and/or palpitations  per the 
investigator’s discretion and repeated as needed . 
i An ECG will be performed at an ET or Unscheduled Visit if deemed necessary by the investigator.  
j Urine drug screen will include tests for amphetamines, cocaine, tetrahydrocannabinol, methylenedioxymethamphetamine, and opiates.  
k Clinical laboratory assessments performed at the Screening Visit will include CBC with differential (red blood cell, total and differential white blood cell, 
hemoglobin, hematocrit, and platelet count), Chem 7 panel (blood urea nitrogen, total carbon dioxi de, creatinine, glucose, chloride, potassium, sodium), liver 
function tests (aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin ), and TSH  with reflex to T4 .  
l Clinical laboratory assessments may be performed at an ET or Unscheduled Visit per the investigator’s discretion .  
m A urine POC  pregnancy test will be conducted for all women of childbearing potential at Visit 1 (Day 1 Pre -dose) and Visit 2 (Day 8 Pre -dose). Results from 
all tests must be negative to proceed with dosing.  
n A urine POC  pregnancy test may be performed on females of childbearing potential at an ET or Unscheduled Visit if pregnancy is suspected.  
o Participants  must have fasted from food and drink for 2 hours prior to study drug administration,  and must have abstained from any other oral product that has 
the potential to interfere with SL atropine absorption (e.g., candy, chewing gum, mints, etc .) for 2 hours prior to study drug administration .  
p Blood samples for PK analysis will be taken at time 0 (pre -dose) and at 13 time points post- dose at 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 45, 60, and 90 minutes and 2, 2.5, 4, 6, and 
8 hours.

Protocol BP-C-24-0001  Version 1.0  13 February 2024  
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  67 APPENDIX 3. PREP  ACT  
The following language applies only to Clinical Research Sites located in the United States.  
Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act  
The drug atropine and the efforts for this clinical trial are covered under the Public Readiness 
and Emergency Preparedness Act (PREP Act) and the Declaration issued by the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services under that Act. Under the PREP Act and the 
Declaration, covered persons (such as manufacturers, distributers, program planners, and other 
qualified persons who prescribe, administer or dispense study drug) are immune from liability from the administration, or use of a covered countermeasure, s uch as atropine . The PREP Act 
provides immunity for covered persons from liability, unless the injury was caused by willful misconduct.  
The PREP Act also established the Countermeasures Injury Compensation Program (CICP) to  
provide compensation for serious injuries or death that occur as the direct result of the  
administration or use of certain countermeasures. Any requests for compensation must be filed  
within one year of the administration or use of the covered countermeasure. Requests for 
Benefits must be made to the Health Resources and Services Administration’s Countermeasures 
Injury Compensation Program ( http://www.hrsa.gov/cicp/) by filing a Request for Benefits Form 
and all required medical records and supporting documentation. Additional  information on filing 
a Request for Benefits is available on the CICP’s website at  http://www.hrsa.gov/cicp/. 
Compensation may then be available for reasonable and necessary medical benefits, lost wages and/or death benefits to eligible individuals for certain injuries in  accordance with regulations 
published by the Secretary of HHS (found at 42 CFR part 110). 
If an individual suffers a serious physical injury or death from the administration or use of a  
covered countermeasure in this study, the individual, the individual’s legal or personal 
representative, the administrator/executor of a deceased individual’s estate, or certain survivors  
may request benefits from the CICP. A serious physical injury means an injury that warranted  
hospitalization (whether or not the person was actually hospitalized) or that led to a significant loss of function or disability. The CICP is the payer of last resort. This means that it only covers  
expenses or provides benefits that other third- party payers (such as health insurance, the 
Department of Veterans Affairs, or Workers’ Compensation programs) do not have an obligation to pay. 
If the Secretary of HHS does not make a final determination on the individual’s request within  
240 days, or if the individual decides not to accept the compensation, the injured individual or 
his representative may pursue a tort claim in the US District Court for the District of Columbia,  
but only if the claim involves willful misconduct and meets the other requirements for suit under 
the PREP Act. Any award is reduced by any public or private insurance or worker’s 
compensation available to the injured indi vidual. Awards for non- economic damages, such as 
pain, suffering, physical impairment, mental anguish, and loss of consortium are also limited. If 
the individual accepts compensation, or if there is no willful misconduct, then the individual does 
not have a tort claim that can be filed in a US Federal or a State court.

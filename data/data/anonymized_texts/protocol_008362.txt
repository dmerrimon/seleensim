Introduction  
This document is a protocol for a human research study. This study is to be conducted according to 
applicable government regulations and Institutional research policies and procedures, and State Law. 
 
2.1 Background and Rationale 
 
Endometrial cancer survivors have an extremely high prevalence of inactivity and obesity. The US 
has a large and rapidly growing population of 760,000 endometrial cancer survivors, which will increase 
55% by 2030.1, 2 Despite a generally favorable 81% 5-year survival rate, patients remain at increased risk 
for cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and other cancers.3 A key risk factor for endometrial cancer is 
unopposed estrogen, which is linked to inactivity and obesity.4, 5 Indeed, up to 90% of Type 1 endometrial 
cancer patients are obese.6 Inactivity and obesity are associated with poorer outcomes among survivors. 
In the NIH -AARP Diet and Health Study, endometrial cancer survivors who were physically active had a 
lower all -cause 5-year mortality rate and lower BMI was associated with lower risk of both overall and 
disease-specific mortality.7 
6  There is a critical need for data about the feasibility and benefits of strength training in this 
population. Other interventions have demonstrated that walking and aerobic exercise are safe and feasible 
in endometrial  cancer patients.8-11 However  few published studies  have  examined strength training in 
endometrial cancer survivors, and these have done so only in combination with aerobic PA intervention 
(and often also dietary change) in the context of a larger multi -component intervention.12, 13 Therefore the 
specific contribution of strength training remains unknown. This is important because aerobic exercise leads  
to improvements  in the cardiovascular  system,  whereas  resistance training has specific  effects  at the 
musculoskeletal level in addition to systematic cardiovascular benefits.14 Strength training increases muscle 
mass, which is critically important given the high prevalence of sarcopenic obesity among middle- aged 
and older women.15 It is also highly effective for functional improvements such as increased strength and 
balance.16, 17 Indeed, in other cancer survivor groups, strength training is more effective than aerobic 
exercise for improving functional status.14 Another benefit of strength training is that it is a realistic health 
promotion option given poor long-term efficacy of weight loss interventions.18 Unfortunately, without 
intervention, strength training has a relatively high barrier to participation among women, due to factors such as lack of knowledge and difficulty finding time to travel to a gym.
19 
 
Previous strength training interventions not optimized for rural populations. Rural areas are often 
underserved in terms of medical access/use and educational and economic opportunities.20, 21 
Consequently, rural populations are diagnosed at later stages of cancer22 and have higher rates of cancer 
mortality.23 Unfortunately, previous strength training research in cancer populations have mainly used 
supervised sessions  with a personal  trainer at a gym,  an approach that is not feasible in many  rural settings.  
 
Overview of proposed research. To address  these gaps, we propose a 2-arm pilot trial of a home-based 
strength training intervention (vs. waitlist  control)  among 40 endometrial  cancer  survivors.  The intervention 
will consist  of (a) an initial in-person instructional  session; (b) instructional  materials  and resistance  training 
equipment (e.g., resistance bands) and (c) support and feedback provided via video coaching sessions. 
The purpose of a pilot trial is not to conduct hypothesis testing, but rather to field-test the logistical 
components of the study to incorporate into a larger, future study design.24 With small samples, the true 
effect size is more likely to be under or overestimated, therefore hypothesis testing is not valid.25 Our aims 
are designed accordingly. 
 
 
2.2 Aims and Hypotheses 
The proposed trial will determine the feasibility of an at-home resistance training protocol and 
measurements of exercise logging, functional fitness testing, DXA, dried blood spots and questionnaire 
measures. Participants will be assigned either to the resistance training program (i.e., initial in-person 
instructional  session, telephone coaching, and self-monitoring) or to a comparison arm (wait-list control). 
• Aim 1: To determine the feasibility of recruiting and retaining endometrial cancer survivors to a home - 
based resistance training 2 sessions  per week  of 20-40 minutes  of exercise. We hypothesize that we will 
meet the accrual goal and maintain >90%  retention. 
• Aim 2: To determine participant satisfaction with each component of the intervention and identify 
opportunities for refinement of the intervention prior to testing in a larger study. We hypothesize that the 
participants will adhere to 90% of the prescribed exercise sessions and that overall satisfaction will be high. 
• Aim 3: To establish that functional  and objective  assessments  are feasible and well-tolerated in enrolled 
participants,  as assessed  using the functional  fitness  test (FFT)  battery, dual-energy  x-ray absorptiometry 
(DXA), finger-pricks for dried blood spots and patient-reported outcomes. We hypothesize that these 
assessments  will be well tolerated, as measured by the percent of participants  who complete all measures 
and data from participant feedback  questionnaires. 
7  2.3 Potential Risk and Benefits to Subjects 
 
2.3.1 Known Potential Risks 
Potential risks of participating in this study include musculoskeletal soreness and a possible loss of 
confidentiality, either through the breach of non-identifiable data collected online, or through the breach of 
secure study databases or physical  files. 
Potential Benefits of the Proposed Research to Human Subjects and Others: Findings from the 
proposed study will contribute to the scientific knowledge of the feasibility of resistance training 
interventions in endometrial cancer survivors. Additionally, the knowledge gained will contribute to the 
scientific knowledge aimed at understanding the potential therapeutic benefits of resistance training 
exercise for endometrial cancer survivors. The risks of our study procedures are low and therefore are seen as justifiable in regards to the knowledge to be gained. 
Importance of Knowledge to be gained: Increasing physical activity after a cancer diagnosis is an 
important area of researching, and finding feasibly interventions for endometrial cancer survivors are key to sustainable lifestyle changes. This research will take the first step that will provide valuable 
information and serve  as a scaffolding for the continued design and development of future interventions.  
 
2.3.2 Protection against  Risks 
Study procedures will be reviewed and approved annually by the University of Wisconsin Health 
Sciences  Institutional  Review  Board. Participants  will be completing this intervention  in their own home, 
and will be directed to stop exercising immediately if they experience any chest pains or abnormal symptoms  such  as dizziness,  faintness, nausea etc. Additionally, in order  to maximize  participant safety 
and well -being, several strategies will be implemented to protect against and minimize any potential 
risks and to protect the privacy of all participants.  Including:  
• All participants will be screened with a telephone interview to determine their health status, 
eligibility, and ability to participate in aerobic exercise (Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire; PAR-Q)  
• Although the exercises will be completed at home, participants will be instructed to 
discontinue exercise if they experienc e any dizziness or light-headedness or pain in their 
chest. We will recommend that participants with continued issue to seek out their primary  care 
physician.  
• To minimize risks to confidentiality, participants will be assigned a study ID number to be 
used in place of their name. The only document linking study ID number and the participant’s 
name will be kept separate from the data used for data processing and analysis. Only authorized study personnel will have access to the data. Electronic data will be coded and 
entered into a secured file on the Physical Activity Epidemiology lab server which is located in 
a password protected area with firewall protection and backed up daily. Moreover, the screening data for eligible participants will be kept and secured in a locked file cabinet in the 
Physical Activity Epidemiology lab until the participants has either completed the study, removed themselves from participation, or is excluded from participation. All screening data for 
eligible participants will be shredded upon participant completion, dropout, or exclusion from 
the study. Phone screening data from any interested potential participants not meeting 
inclusion criteria will be shredded immediately. 
• If used, web-based surveys and their accompanying database will reside on a secure 
survey server. No private health information will reside on the survey server, only  randomly 
generated ID numbers. Survey information will then be pulled into the secure database. 
 
2.3.3 Potential Benefits to the Subjects 
There are no anticipated benefits to the participants in this research study. 
8  2.3.4 Risk Minimization:  
No drug, biologic, or dietary supplement will be used in this study. To minimize risk, participants will 
undergo distal finger pricks to collect blood samples as opposed to traditional venipuncture for 
collection of blood biomarkers. No other laboratory tests will be conducted. 
 
3 Study  Aims  
• Aim 1: To determine the feasibility of recruiting and retaining endometrial cancer survivors to a 
home-based resistance training 2 sessions per week of 20-40 minutes of exercise.  
• Aim 2: To determine participant satisfaction with each component of the intervention and identify 
opportunities for refinement of the intervention prior to testing in a larger  study. 
• Aim 3: To establish that functional and objective assessments are feasible and well -tolerated in 
enrolled participants, as assessed using the functional fitness test (FFT) battery, dual -energy x -ray 
absorptiometry (DXA), finger -pricks for dried blood spots and patient-reported outcomes. 
 
4 Study Design and Endpoints  
4.1 General  Design 
• A phase III, randomized, two-arm trial with a wait-list control  group 
• The intervention itself is 10 weeks, with an additional five week follow up assessment for 
those in the exercise arm to determine adoption of the program. Overall, the  anticipated total 
duration should be 20 weeks for participants  
• The intervention will consist of (a) an initial in -person instructional session; (b) instructional 
materials and resistance training equipment (e.g., resistance bands) and (c) support and 
feedback provided via video coaching sessions; and (d) a final in-person study visit to collect 
post-study m easures for both groups  
 
4.1.1 Primary Study Endpoints 
The primary endpoint is adherence to prescribed exercise sessions as measured using exercise 
logging and video sessions of exercises.  
 
4.1.2 Secondary Study Endpoints 
Secondary endpoints to be measured include qualitative satisfaction with intervention, blood biomarkers, lean muscle mass, body composition, functional fitness performance, self-efficacy, quality of life measures, and accelerometer -measured physical activity.  
 
4.1.3 Primary Safety Endpoints 
The primary safety endpoint will be total number of adverse events over the duration of the 
intervention.  
 
5 Study  Infrastructure 
The general  infrastructure for this study  will include an overall  PI (Dr.  Lisa Cadmus -Bertram). There will be 
additionally  one primary biostatistician for the study, and one main  study  coordinator  who will be responsible 
for managing daily study  operations.  
 
6 Study Subjects – Enrollment and Withdrawal  
• Accrual Goal: The study aims to enroll 40 participants over a one-year period. Subjects will 
be identified through their clinician/oncologist to determine interest in the study before being 
screened over the telephone by study  staff.  
• Participants will be screened over the phone to determine eligibility, and enrollment in the 
study will occur after screening by both the clinician/oncologist and research staff. The screening procedures will be performed under a separate screening consent form. 
9  6.1 Subject  Population 
Age range of participants  include  ages  18-74 which  is the range where diagnosis  of endometrial  cancer 
is most common. Because we intend to study adults, and not geriatric populations, the upper cap on 
the age for this study  is 74 as to not dilute or modify  the effect of resistance  training in adults  compared 
to elderly  populations.  
 
Women are the only participants in this study as endometrial cancer doesn’t afflict men. No minorities 
or ethnic groups will be excluded from this study. We will recruit subjects without regard for minority status and ethnic status will be coded according to the Office of Management and Budget (OMG) 
Directive No. 15. The estimated ethnic/racial composition is presented in the Targeted/Planned 
Enrollment table and is representative of women in the geographic area of the proposed study (2010 Census Data for Madison, WI: 79% white, non- Hispanic; 7% African American; 7% Hispanic or Latino; 
7% other ethnic/racial identities).  
 
6.2 Inclusion Criteria

within 30 days prior to randomization  
8. Women who are pregnant or breast -feeding  
9. Not suitable for study participation due to other reasons at the discretion of the investigator  
 
6.4 Subject Screening for  Recruitment  
 
6.4.1 Subject Identification 
Participants will be recruited primarily through referrals at the research site. At the primary site, it 
will be UW -Madison’s gynecologic oncology clinic, assisted by the UW Carbone Cancer Center’s 
Gynecology  Disease Oriented Team  (DOT), a group that supports  accrual  to both collaborative and 
investigator -initiated clinical trials. Potentially eligible patients will be identified by the clinician after 
primary treatment has been completed and initial contact will be made by a member of the study team with endorsement of the medical care team. If needed, recruitment will be augmented via outreach through local cancer support organizations. Patients  referred by their physician will be 
10  contacted by study staff and screened for eligibility over the telephone. Self-referred participants 
will undergo telephone screening first, then eligibility will then be confirmed with the woman’s 
physician. Recruitment methods will be the same between potential subject groups, i.e. same in 
treatment and wait-list control groups. 
Additionally, members of the clinical care team may identify eligible cancer survivors  from the 
electronic health record ( EHR) and provide contact information for potentially eligible individuals to 
members of the study team. The study team will mail a letter to these individuals  inviting them to 
participate, and providing them with information on how to contact the study team to enroll or to opt 
out. 
 
Should we encounter difficulties with recruitment, we may accrue participants through community - 
based strategies including posting fliers at partnership organizations (such as Gilda’s Club, for example). The primary mechanism of subject identification will be through referrals at the research site, but if necessary we may deploy community, word of mouth and flier -based recruitment. 
 
 
6.4.2 Permission to Contact  Form  
Participants will be identified and recruited primarily through referrals at the research site, and 
prospective participants  who are interested in the study  will be asked to sign a Permission to Contact 
Form (Appendix 7) which allows members of the research team to contact them. Those who would 
like to be contacted to learn more about the study will sign the permission to contact from at the 
clinical  site, and then those  forms  will be delivered to members  of the research team  to contact and 
screen for eligibility  for the study. Once  the permission to contact form is signed, the research team 
will take over to confirm eligibility, screen over the phone and enroll in the  study.  
 
6.4.3 Recruitment and Retention Strategies 
Participants will be recruited primarily through referrals at the research site. If necessary, participants may be recruited through community partnerships through fliers and word of mouth 
recruiting.  
 
Because the intervention is only 10 weeks in duration with a five week follow up, we do not anticipate 
major issues with participant retention. We have experience conducting several  previous  PA trials  in 
cancer  survivors and typically observe only ~5% loss to follow -up in a short-term study. To 
encourage retention, participants will receive $50  compensation at the baseline visit and again at 
the 10-week follow -up visit.  
 
7.5 Vulnerable  Populations 
No vulnerable populations will be included in this study design. 
 
TABLE 1: Vulnerable populations included and excluded from this study  
 
Include  Exclude  Vulnerable Population Type  
 X Adults unable to consent  
 X Individuals who are not yet adults (e.g. infants, children, teenagers)  
 X Wards of the State (e.g. foster children)  
 X Pregnant women  
 X Prisoners  
 
7.5.1 Subject  Capacity 
All subjects will have the capacity to give informed consent, else they will be excluded from this 
study.  
 
7.6 Informed Consent  
11  The PI will be responsible for ensuring that valid consent is obtained and documented for all 
subjects unless the IRB waives the requirement for documentation of informed consent for all or part of the study. Verbal consent will be given for the telephone screeni ng questionnaire; however 
for the intervention, informed consent will be obtained during an in-person visit.  
7.6.1 Process of Consent  
 
• Consent will be obtained by either the PI, or by the Study  Coordinator.  
• Consent will be documented by having the participant sign the form, with a member  of the study 
team signing to affirm the witnessing of the signing. One copy will be made and given to the participant, with another kept by the study team. Documentation will be stored in each participant’s individual research file at the site’s pre-determined storage location.  
• Informed consent will be structured to be conducive to rational and thoughtful decision making by asking the prospective participant several questions about the intervention, including how  to 
withdraw, how the groups will be allocated, what participation consists of, as well as what are the alternatives to participation.  
 
7.6.2 Consent Form  
The informed consent document for this study is maintained as a separate 
document.  
7.6.3 HIPAA  
Information about study subjects will be kept confidential and managed according to the 
requirements of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 ( HIPAA ). 
Attached/submitted as part of our application is a signed subject authorization form that includes 
information collected during this study as well as from medical record data will be used by the 
researchers  and research staff as a part of this investigation.  A HIPPA authorization form is attached 
to this protocol as an Appendix.  
 
7.6.4 Revoking Consent 
In the event that a subject revokes  authorization to collect or use PHI, the investigator, by regulation, 
retains  the ability  to use all information collected  prior to the revocation of subject  authorization. For 
subjects that have revoked authorization to collect or use PHI, attempts should be made to obtain permission to collect at least vital status (i.e. that the subject is alive) at the end of their scheduled study  period. 
 
7.6.5 Costs to the Subject  
There will be no costs to the participants for this study, any costs occurred during this research study will be covered by the grant funding mechanism. 
 
7.6.6 Payment for  Participation 
Participants will be paid $50 in cash at the baseline visit as well as another $50 cash at the final 
(post-intervention) visit. Those who complete the intervention will receive a total of $ 100 cash.  
At the instructional visit, participants will be provided with exercise equipment (towel, band, duffle bag, resistance bands, and dumbbells) that they will use for the intervention and will be allowed to 
keep after the intervention has completed. Any parking costs  required for the in-person visits  will be 
covered as a part of the  study.  
 
7.7 Early Withdrawal of  Subjects  
 
7.7.1 When and How to Withdraw Subjects 
Participants  may withdraw  from the study  prior to expected completion due to safety  reason, losses 
to follow up, failure of subject to adhere to protocol requirements, subject consent withdrawal, etc. 
12   
7.7.2 Data Collection and Follow -up for Withdrawn Subjects 
Data will be attempted to be gathered from participants who have withdrawn from the study to collect 
their data prior to their withdrawal, including emails from the research staff and telephone calls. 
Withdrawn subjects  will be analyzed  using an intent to treat analysis, therefore maximizing  the amount 
of data is paramount to success.  However,  if participants  cannot be contacted after 3 attempts  from the 
study team (both telephone calls and emails) then the participants will be considered lost to follow -up. 
 
8 Study  Procedures  
Wait list interventions 
After being randomized to the wait-list group, participants will be scheduled for their 10 week follow up visit. The 
wait list arm will not have the additional five week follow up that the exercise arm receives. Participants will be 
reminded that at that final visit, participants will complete the same study measures (body composition, functional 
fitness testing, blood sample collection, and anthropometrics) and will also receive study materials at the end of their wait list period. Participants in the wait list group will also complete accelerometer (Actigraph) assessments at 
three study points: Early in the intervention near the instructional visit, at the mid-way (5 -week) mark, and before 
the final visit. These accelerometers will be sent and received via mail and participants will receive instructions on 
how to wear, use and send to us during the instructional visit.  
 
 
Exercise interventions 
After being randomized to the exercise (intervention) arm, participants will be scheduled for an instructional vis it 
with the study coordinator within a week of randomization. At that visit, participants will be instructed to wear 
comfortable clothes and shoes for learning the exercises. The instructional visit includes going through each exercise of the intervention (see Table below) to learn the movement, learn the muscle groups involved, and to learn how to monitor themselves by tracking their progress via logs. This instructional visit should take 60-90 minutes, and each participant will receive a summary sheet of her starting point at each exercise with respect to 
intensity and progressions/regressions. For example, a participant may be starting on a blue resistance band for 
biceps curls, but the squats may simply be body weight at this time. Table below outlines the exercises for the intervention.  
 
 
During the study period, participants in the intervention arm will be instructed to complete the exercise routine twice 
a week for 10 weeks  during the intervention, and also continued throughout the five week follow up period. There 
are eight video calls with the study coordinator to check in, to identify any issues or concerns with the exercises, 
and to finally monitor progress in the form of assessing volume/intensity/difficulty of each of the exercises. These calls are done over video so that the coordinator can build rapport with participants, and that participants can show 

13  or demonstrate issues with exercises or their form. At the mid-poi nt of the study, participants will receive an email 
with the questionnaires, so that the questionnaires will be done at baseline, at the study mid-point, and at the final 
visit.  
Participants in the intervention group will also complete accelerometer (Actigraph) assessments at three study 
points : Early in the intervention near the instructional visit, at the mid-way (5 -week) mark, and before the final visit. 
These accelerometers will be sent and received via mail and participants will receive instructions on how to wear, 
use and send to us during the instructional visit.  
At the end of the 10 week period, participants will return to the UW campus for a final visit to repeat baseline study measures. At this time, intervention arm participants will also complete an exit-style interview with the study 
coordinator to help improve the intervention for future participants. This will be recorded, but anonymized upon transcription.  
While the formal intervention period will be 10 weeks in duration, we will continue to follow those in the exercise arm for five weeks post- final assessment. This follow up period will consist of surveys to the participants assessing 
the frequency of the home-based resistance exercise, to determine if the behavior of exercise persists in the short-term following intervention conclusion. 
8.1 Measures  
Below are the study measures that will be collected over the course of the intervention: 
• Demographics and other participant characteristics: Participants will self-report age, 
race/ethnicity, marital  status, education, and cancer characteristics  (tumor type and stage, dates 
of diagnosis and treatment completion, treatment received). Clinical information will be confirmed with the medical  record.  
• When collected:  Baseline 
• Accelerometer. Although aerobic and lifestyle PA (e.g., MVPA, steps) are not a focus of the 
intervention, they will be assessed to determine baseline PA level and identify whether uptake 
of resistance training is associated with changes in other PA types. Participants will wear the 
ActiGraph wGT3X-BT accelerometer (ActiGraph, Pensacola, FL) for 7 days during all waking 
hours. The ActiGraph is a gold standard method of objective activity assessment.26, 27  
• When collected: Baseline, mid -point (~5 weeks), final visit (~10 weeks)  
• Biomarkers. Using a standardized protocol, participants will undergo a fingerpick to collect a 
peripheral blood sample to assess glycosylated hemoglobin (A1c) and c -Reactive Protein28 via 
dried blood spots. The values for both A1c and CRP are highly correlated between dried blood 
spots and venipuncture.29 
• When collected: Baseline, final visit (~10 weeks)  
• Anthropometrics. Height, weight, waist and hip circumferences will be measured according to 
standard protocols.  
• When collected: Baseline, final visit (~10 weeks)  
• Body  composition. Resistance training can improve body  composition even without weight loss. 
Body  composition will therefore be assessed  using dual-energy  absorptiometry  (DXA) using the 
enCORE Lunar iDXA software suite (GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont, UK). DXA provides a precise measure of fat mass, lean mass, total % body fat, and visceral fat and is sensitive to small changes from pre- to post-intervention.
30  
• When collected: Baseline, final visit (~10 weeks)  
• Functional fitness. The functional fitness test (FFT) is a battery of six tests measuring strength, 
flexibility, fitness, body composition, and agility. It has high test-retest reliability and is suitable 
for tracking within-person changes.31 The functional fitness test battery includes the following 6 
assessments: 1.) The 30 second chair stand, which assesses the strength of the lower body. 
Each person will have 30 seconds to stand up and sit down from a chair as many times as possible within the time frame. 2.) The 30 second arm curl assesses the strength of the upper 
body, where women will hold a 5 pound dumbbell in a seated position, and they will have 30 
14  seconds to curl their arm and extend it as many times as possible within the time frame. 3.) The 
6 minute walk test  measures the total distance that a person can quickly walk on a flat hard 
surface within a period of 6 minutes, using a 100ft length of distance. 4.) The chair sit and 
reach assesses the lower body flexibility where the participant will sit in a chair, extend one leg 
in front of them and flex at the waist, reaching toward their toes, and we will measure the 
distance between their toes and fingers. 5.) The 8-foot -up and go is an assessment of speed 
agility and balance. With this assessment, the participant begins in a seated position, and will 
be timed for the duration it takes to  rise from the chair, walk as quickly as possible around a 
cone 8 feet away from the chair, and return to a seated position. 6.) The back scratch test  is 
an assessment of the flexibility of the upper body, where the person will be seated and one arm will be flexed behind the head, and the other arm will be extended behind the shoulder. The 
assessment measures the distance between the finger tips of both hands. 
• When collected: Baseline, final visit (~10 weeks)  
• Quality  of life (QOL).  QOL  changes  will be captured using the Functional  Assessment of Cancer 
Therapies (FACT) questionnaire including the Endometrial subscale (FACT-En).32 These 
measures will be repeated at the study mid-point (5 weeks) to assess changes over  time.  
• When collected: Baseline, mid-point (~5 weeks), final visit (~10 weeks)  
• Mental well -being. Changes in mental well -being (including anxiety, depression, and fatigue) will 
be assessed using standardized PROMIS measures.33 These measures will be repeated at the 
study mid-point (5 weeks) to assess changes over  time.  
• When collected: Baseline, mid-point (~5 weeks), final visit (~10 weeks)  
• Self-efficacy. This will be assessed using  the validated self-efficacy  for exercise scale,  modified 
for specificity to strength training.34 These measures will be repeated at the study mid-point (5 
weeks) to assess changes over  time. 
• When collected: Baseline, mid-point (~5 weeks), final visit (~10 weeks)  
• Adherence. Compliance and adherence will be measured via detailed exercise logs. A 
participant needs to complete at least 50% of the prescribed exercises in a session to be 
considered adherent to the session.  
• When collected: ongoing, logs will be completed throughout the intervention and 
submitted at the final visit 
• Additionally, for those in the intervention arm, we will ask that they continue to conduct the prescribed exercises for an additional  five weeks after study 
completion. Participants will still submit paper logs, and this adherence measure 
will allow for study of adherence without prescribed check -ins from the study 
coordinator over the five week period.  
• Acceptability. Participants will participate in a semi -structured qualitative interviews with the 
study  coordinator. Interviews  will be recorded, transcribed  and coded to identify  content themes. 
These interviews will be used to collect qualitative information and overall satisfaction with the 
intervention, as well as areas to improve with future interventions and barriers to participation.  
• When collected:  Final visit (~10 weeks)  
8.2 Video calls  
 Participants will receive a tablet for the duration of the intervention for video conferencing with research team. Phone call conferencing will be available, however the tablets allow for video applications so that participants can 
visually interface with members of the research team. Additionally, using video conferencing allows participants to receive feedback and form recommendations from her home if she has questions or would like feedback on her 
performance for specific exercises. However, because this is a pilot intervention, we aim to determine if the video 
15  conferencing component is useful. By providing each participant with a tablet, we are inclusive for individuals who 
may not have access to these resources on her own. Each participant will receive a check -in at eight points during 
the 10 week study: two calls in the first week, one during weeks three four and five, one during week six , and finally one  during week eight consistent with their preferred contact method to provide feedback on their progress 
and resistance training. The study coordinator will ask about overall qualitative satisfaction, and issues the participant is having, and any questions that the study coordinator could potentially address. Participants are welcome to reach out to the lab or study coordinator at any point during the study, however these pre-planned check in visits will hopefully facilitate discussion if any issues remain unaddressed.  
 
8.3 Labs  
Blood spots:  In a non-clinical  setting,  dried blood  spots  collected using finger pricks are a low-cost  way 
to establish the feasibility of biomarker data collection. Using a standardized protocol, participants will 
undergo a fingerpick  to collect  a peripheral  blood sample to assess glycosylated  hemoglobin (A1c) and 
c-Reactive Protein50 via dried blood spots. Dried blood spots can be collected by non-phlebotomists in 
non-clinical settings, and the values for both A1c and CRP are highly correlated between dried blood 
spots and venipuncture.51 
 
8.4 Established Standard of  Care:  
 
There are currently no established standards of care in terms of prescribing exercise (especially 
resistance training exercise) in endometrial cancer surviv ors. 
 
Table 3. Study Calendar of scheduled measures 
 
 
 
8.5 Study Visits  
 
8.4.1  Screening/Baseline:  
Baseline. At this visit, the study  coordinator  will explain 
the study  and obtain written informed  consent. Physical 
measurements (anthropometrics, blood sample, DXA 
scan, functional fitness testing) will be completed. The 
study coordinator will instruct the participant on how to properly wear the accelerometer  (to be returned via 
pre-paid mailer), complete a 7-day  PA log, and 
complete the online questionnaires.  
Randomization. After  all baseline measures  have  been  
completed and checked, the participant will be 
randomized with 1:1 probability to the intervention or wait-list control group. A blocked randomization 
scheme will ensure equal allocation of participants to each group. Participants will be notified of their group 
assignment by phone; those in the intervention group 
will be scheduled for the intervention introductory  session. (Those in the wait-list control  group  will 
receive this session  at the same  time as the final measures are collected.)  
Instructional. Participants randomized to the intervention group will meet with study coordinator to 
learn how to conduct the exercises, how to use the materials, how to complete the exercise log and 
general instructions on the normal symptoms of resistance training. This visit should take 1-2 hours, ensuring the participant is confident.  
8.4.2  Follow up:

8.4.4  Final Study Visit  
 
Final  Visit. All participants  will return for follow -up assessments  at 10 weeks. In advance, the participant 
will be mailed an accelerometer and 7-day PA log and will receive a link to complete the online 
questionnaires. Physical measures (anthropometrics, blood sample, DXA scan, functional fitness testing) will be completed. Those women in the wait-list control group will receive their introductory 
intervention session at this  visit. 
 
9 Study  Analysis  
9.1 Sample Size Determination 
Sample Size and Power. The purpose  of this trial is not to conduct  hypothesis  testing, but rather to field- 
test the intervention to identify adherence rates to exercise prescription across a group of participants. 
At this time, the anticipated effect size is unknown and the sample size of 40 has been selected to 
maximize feasibility in the anticipated time frame for this  project.  
 
9.2 Statistical Methods 
As this is the first investigation in this population to look at this resistance training, both in terms of adherence rates as well as objective and functional changes in performance, there are no published effect sizes to anticipate at this time; therefore, we have a feasibility/descriptive focus as opposed to a hypothesis -testing focus. In addition to quantitative analysis, we plan to conduct qualitative analyses 
from participant feedback  surveys to assess  barriers to participation and to improve future interventions 
and to increase adherence rates.  
 
9.3 Subject Population(s) for Analysis 
The populations for this investigation include:  
• All-randomized population: Any subject randomized into the study, regardless  of whether they received 
study  agent  
• All-treated population: Any subject randomized into the study that received at least the instructional 
visit of the intervention  
• Protocol -compliant population: Any subject who was randomized, was allocated to the exercise group 
and provided at least one set of data elements required by the protocol.  
 
9.3.1  Describe the types of  analysis:  
• Primary Analysis: The primary objective includes measuring the percentage of completed sessions compared to prescribed, and a one-sample t-test will be conducted to determine if that 
proportion, across participants, is >90%. A one-sample t-test will be done to determine if retention is >90%.  
17  • Secondary Analyses: The secondary analyses includes measuring the objective and functional 
changes from pre to post intervention as well as differences between groups. Paired ANOVAs and descriptive statistics will be used to analyze functional and objective data, as well as participant feedback data, including satisfaction with each component of the intervention. 
• Exploratory, longitudinal analyses: Content analysis will be done on the qualitative interviews  to 
examine barriers to physical activity, as well as satisfaction with the intervention, and identification 
of themes to improve the intervention. Although formal hypothesis testing is not part of our specific 
aims, we will conduct longitudinal analyses of the data we collect to estimate potential magnitude of expected changes, as well as longitudinal analysis of the repeated measures.  
• Safety Analysis: The safety analysis includes simple descriptive analysis about the number of 
adverse events over the course of the intervention between groups and across  sites.  
 
9.4 Planned Interim Analysis:  
There are no planned interim analyses for this investigation. 
 
10 Data Collection, Handling and Record Keeping  
10.1 Data  Confidentiality  
• We will take extensive measures to ensure data safety and security. A dedicated study database will 
be constructed on a secure server using the REDCap study management system.56 To ensure quality 
control and appropriate completion of self-report measures, questionnaires will be collected online. 
Data quality will be checked by examining descriptive statistics and checking ranges of missing values.  
 
10.1.1 Confidentiality of Subject Records 
By signing the protocol, the Investigator agrees that IRB and NCI representative may consult and/or copy 
study documents in order to verify CRF data. By signing the consent form, the subject agrees to this 
proces s. If study documents will be photocopied during the process of verifying CRF information, the 
subject will be identified by unique code only and full names and similar identifying information (such as medical record number or social security number) will be masked. 
 
The Clinical Site Investigators will ensure that the identity of subjects will be protected. All study records 
will be maintained in a secure fashion with access limited to essential study personnel only. All study 
documents  submitted to the Coordinating Center will have  identifiers  removed other than dates  of birth and 
service and subjects will be identified with a study -specific identification number only. The Clinical Site 
Investigators will maintain, in a secure location, an enrollment log that includes subject identifying information and links subjects to their study -specific identification number. 
 
10.2 Data  Capture 
 
10.2.1  Missing  Data  
Strategies for handling missing data will be chosen based on the type and extent of the problem under advisement from biostatistician Dr. Gangnon. It is anticipated that sensitivity analyses or model -based 
approaches will be assessed for appropriateness for this investigation. 
 
10.2.2  Data Collection Tools  
UW-ICTR provides REDCap that will be used for data collection for this investigation. This tool is self- 
service, secure, and can be easily used across all study sites to ensure appropriate data collection. Additionally, this tool is buildable for the unique needs of this investigation, and we plan to use the 
participant as the unit of measure for this study, and not the time point as the unit of measure. 
18   
 
10.3 Records Retention 
To ensure the integrity of the data collected from study participants, several procedures will be 
implemented. All personnel involved in data collection will be thoroughly trained in all assessment methods, thus ensuring consistent applications of procedures and measurement consistency across participants. All questionnaire data will be automatically saved in the secured, password protected Qualtrics or REDCap systems and will be downloaded to a password protected network folder on a 
secure server (i.e., password protected) which is backed up daily ensuring access only by the investigators. All other data will be saved to a computer hard drive in real time and then stored on a secure server (i.e., password protected) which is backed up daily. All raw data are kept in locked cabinets in the site-PI’s laboratory. All hardcopies of raw data will be de- identified (with the exception 
of the study ID number) and copied for mailing to the coordinating center for data management. 
Although all packages  with data will be mailed  by certified mail so that tracking  the location is possible, 
maintaining copies of the data at the collaborating centers in locked cabinets in the site investigator’s 
laboratory will be done in the unlikely event that data is lost in the mail. Informed consent forms will be kept in a separate locked file cabinet with restricted access. Issues related to data integrity will be discussed on a weekly basis as a recurring agenda item in the weekly project meeting. Finally, continuing review of all procedures will be obtained by all appropriate institutional review  boards.  
 
Study  data will be labeled with a study  ID number.  Data linking  the study  ID numbers  with subject  identities 
will be stored in hard copy format only. This and other paper files will be kept in a locked file cabinet in 
the Physical Activity Laboratory in the UW Department of Kinesiology (2000 Observ atory Drive, Madison 
WI 53706, Room 2057). The laboratory door is kept locked at all times. Only study personnel will have 
access to participant data. Electronic data, including accelerometer data files, will be kept on a server at 
the Department of Kinesi ology, in a drive accessible only by the PI and study staff. Data will be retained  
for an indefinite amount of time, and all study data will be banked in a coded format. Data may be used in the future for a secondary data analysis looking at relationships between collected study data and other variables. Study data may only be used by the study team, and all future investigations using any banked 
data from this study must undergo a separate IRB application. Use of study data is limited to the research 
team for this protocol, unless a separate IRB application is submitted for use of this banked data for 
future investigations.  
 
10.4 Data and Safety Monitoring  
The Site Investigator (Dr. Cadmus -Bertram) will be responsible for reviewing and monitoring all study 
data and any adverse events for this study.  The Investigator will meet with study personnel at least 
weekly to evaluate study progress, including periodic assessment of data quality and timeliness, participant recruitment, accrual and retention, participant risk versus benefit, and other factors that can 
affect study outcomes. All unanticipated problem s regardless of where they occur, will be reported to 
the University of Wisconsin IRB.   
 
This protocol is considered to have a minimal risk to participants, as it prescribes physical activity that is consistent with national recommendations and guidelines for cancer survivors.  We attempt to reduce 
the risk of injury or muscular soreness by excluding individuals who report difficulty transitioning from sitting to standing, walking 1 block (as a proxy measure of basic physical functioning), or report that they are otherwise unable to work towards the intervention goals. As with any exercise intervention, there is 
also a minor risk of cardiovascular ev ents.  Participants in both intervention groups will receive regular 
check -in calls to assess progress and address any potential problems regarding physical issues or 
emotional stress.

12 Study  Financ es 
12.30  Funding Source  
This study  is financed through an institutional  pilot grant from the American Cancer  Society  and funds 
from the UWCCC.  
 
12.31  Conflict of  Interest  
Any investigator  who has a conflict of interest with this study  (patent ownership, royalties, or financial 
gain greater than the minimum allowable by their institution, etc.) must have the conflict reviewed by 
a properly constituted Conflict of Interest Committee with a Committee-sanctioned conflict 
management plan that has been reviewed and approved by the study sponsor prior to participation 
in this study. All UW investigators will follow the UW conflict of interest policy.  
 
12.32  Subject Stipends or  Payments  
Participants  will be paid $ 50 in cash  at the baseline visit as well as another $ 50 cash  at the final (post- 
intervention) visit. Those who complete the intervention will receive a total of $100 cash. 
 
13 Publication  Plan  
 
The primary responsibility for publication of the results of this study are the investigators at UW Madison 
(Dr. Cadmus -Bertram). Neither the complete nor any part of the results of the study carried out under 
this protocol, nor any of the information provided by the sponsor for the purposes of performing the 
study, will be published or passed on to any third party  without the consent of the study sponsor. Any 
investigator involved with this study is obligated to provide the sponsor with complete test results and all data derived from the study. 
 
14 Protocol implementation timeline and contingency  plans  
There are three primary concerns for this research design and there are listed preliminary contingency plans if these concerns come to fruition: 
• The primary concern is a lack of subjects or low accrual to study participant goals for site numbers. 
o If there is insufficient or slow recruitment through a clinical route, we plan to reach out to 
community support groups such as Gilda’s Club to bolster recruitment numbers. This strategy will not replace the clinical route, but may increase participant enrollment. 
• The secondary  concern is high attrition in the treatment group and potential  losses to follow  up over 
the course of the 10-week  intervention. Although this is a lower probability event, we will utilize the 
following contingency  plans: 
o Deploy follow ups using a suf pport person for the participant that we can contact if the 
participant is not contacting study staff or seems to be lost to follow up 
o At the start of the study, we will collect multiple email addresses and phone numbers from 
20  each participant to avoid this problem a priori. 
• Finally, we may have poor adherence and compliance to the protocol.  
o We have pre-scheduled check -ins during the course of the intervention to avoid this  issue  
o However, we will deploy  additional  health coaching if necessary  where participants  are really 
struggling with adherence 
o Participant satisfaction surveys will be used at the end of the intervention to evaluate the 
quality of the study to learn and improve for the future if adherence is very  high

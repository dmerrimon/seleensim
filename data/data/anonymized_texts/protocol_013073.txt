1.Introduction
1.1. Overview of Therapy Area
Influenza impacts approximately 5-20% of the population of the United States annually , resulting 
in significant economic impact and public health burden (Molinari et al., 2007). For people with
cardiovascular conditions, influenza can be particularly burdensome, thus they are considered a
high-risk group (CDC, 2019). Vaccination for influenza remains the most ef fective primary 
prevention method against influenza, with ef fectiveness ranging from 38-48% in the past few 
years (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 2018; Dos Santos, Tahrat, & 
Bekkat-Berkani, 2018; Doyle, 2019; Jackson et al., 2017; Rolfes et al., 2019). The CDC reports 
that the vaccination rate in the 2018-2019 season was 47.9%  for individuals 18-64 years of age
who have high risk conditions such as cardiovascular conditions (CDC, 2019). While this is 
higher than the rate of 36.4% in same age individuals without high risk conditions, it is far below
the 70% national vaccination rate goal (Healthy People 2020, 2019). Given the increased burden
that influenza represents for people with high risk conditions, even small improvements in
vaccination rates could result in significant impact and provide benefit to patients, healthcare
providers, and insurance payors (Molinari et al., 2007).
1.2. Study Rationale
To date, there are no lar ge-scale RCT s on digital interventions for increasing vaccination rates in 
people with cardiovascular conditions. One observational study has demonstrated the potential
effectiveness of general messaging and incentives via a health-related app to increase vaccine
uptake in the general Canadian population (Dale, White, Mitchell, & Faulkner , 2019), suggesting 
this kind of intervention could be ef fective with people with cardiovascular conditions. In a 
separate study , a lar ge randomized controlled trial (RCT) using digital messaging with incentives 
to vaccinate was found to be ef fective in increasing vaccination rates in a general population of 
adults in the United States (Lee et al., 2020).  Of particular interest is a digital RCT  in a sample 
of individuals with diabetes, a population with increased risk of influenza-related complications,
that used digital messaging and was found to be ef fective in increasing vaccination rates 
(Samson, et al., 2020). An additional study of individuals with diabetes that was a collaboration 
between Sanofi Pasteur and Evidation also demonstrated the impact of influenza and related
complications on data retrieved from wearables; showing that people who developed influenza
engaged in less activity around the time of diagnosis and recorded an increased heart rate, a
unique passive marker of infection (Samson et al., 2019). These studies all suggest that the 
development of a digital intervention tar geted to individuals with cardiovascular conditions could 
be beneficial in increasing vaccination rates.
1.3. Intervention Overview
Version 1
8
of
22
The digital intervention messages were developed using a 3-part approach: 1) a quantitative
assessment of more than 800 patient perspectives for people with cardiovascular disorders,
assessing their behaviors, thoughts, and beliefs surrounding vaccination; 2) semi-structured
interviews with approximately 25 patients who had cardiovascular diseases to gather their
perspectives and feedback on proposed intervention messages; and 3) an expert panel of
cardiologists, behavioral scientists, and vaccine policy experts for expert input on content and
accuracy of scientific information provided. This approach to intervention development was 
consistent with the Patient Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) recommendation for
developing interventions that increase participant recruitment and retention, improve patient
outcomes, and increase research validity and relevance to the real world (Frank, Basch, & Selby , 
2014). The intervention messages provide informational content on the influenza vaccine 
(sourced from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the American Heart 
Association), specific information about influenza and cardiovascular disorders, and behavioral
prompts (e.g., reminders) surrounding influenza vaccination behaviors.
2.Study Objectives
2.1. Primary Objective

5.2. Recruitment Methods
Achievement, a product of Evidation Health, is an online platform where people can connect
their digital health tools, including wearable activity trackers and fitness apps. Achievement
Version 1

members agree to being contacted with study opportunities when they create an Achievement 
account. Evidation Health will leverage Achievement for recruitment, and will use an online 
strategy and study platform to develop a tar get list of participants, verify eligibility , and enroll 
participants into this study .
A set of existing Achievement members who have previously self-reported to meeting the 
inclusion criteria will be tagged for study inclusion, termed “participants” from here on. Since
participants will be blinded to their study participation status, participants will not be asked to
take any action to enroll in the study . In order to identify a tar get list of participants, Evidation 
Health will leverage already permissioned information from Achievement members, including 
data on their cardiovascular diagnoses, age, sex/gender , race/ethnicity , and country of residence. 
These participants will be randomized using block randomization into CVD-Intervention or
CVD-Control prior to being of fered the opportunity to complete any study activities. 
Randomization will ensure that the groups are representative of the general Achievement 
population with cardiovascular disease. Ef forts will be made to tar get individuals for enrollment 
who identify as being of a race/ethnicity that is something other than non-Hispanic White, as 
well as representative in sex/gender . Participants will be sent of fers via the Achievement 
platform to complete study activities. Participants can complete any number of survey activities
(demographics, baseline, 3-month survey , and/or 6-month survey , intervention messages); 
completion of intervention activities will not be required for enrollment for the CVD-I group.

Study Procedures
6.1. Study Enr ollment
Participants will be sent of fers on the Achievement Studies Platform to complete study activities. 
Participants can complete any number of survey activities (baseline, 3-month survey , and/or 
6-month survey , intervention messages); completion of intervention activities will not be 
required for enrollment for the CVD-I group.
6.2. Informed Consent
We will request that informed consent is exempt for this study for the following reasons: 
●
Participation in this study involves no more than minimal risk to the privacy of
individuals. 
●
Given the nature of the study , which aims to measure influenza vaccination rates in a 
real-world setting, priming the participants with a consent form will likely alter the
perception of the interventions and may impact how individuals respond to the study
assessments, potentially biasing the results and limiting the generalizability of the
findings. For this reason, this study could not be practically carried out without the
waiver of informed consent. 
●
At the beginning of each questionnaire, participants will be notified on how their survey
responses and behavioral data will be used for research purposes via a Data Usage &
Permissions Agreement.
Version 1

22
6.3. Study Steps
Participants will be sent an of fer to complete a survey at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months. A 
separate demographic and medical history survey will remain available for participants to
complete throughout the study . Additional information on study experiences and intervention 
feedback will be gathered in the 6-month survey for those in the CVD-I group. Data from an
activity tracker will be collected if one is already connected to the participant’ s Achievement 
account, consistent with their completion of the Data Usage & Permissions Agreement. Activity 
tracker data will be collected retrospectively and prospectively . Participants in the CVD-I arm 
only will be sent intervention messages on predetermined days for the duration of the 6-month
study intervention period. At the end of the intervention period, individuals who completed a 
data usage and permissions agreement as a part of the surveys will be informed via email that the
survey information they contributed was for a research study investigating influenza vaccination
behavior in people with cardiovascular conditions.
6.4. Study Compliance
Evidation study staf f will track whether participants are completing study-related tasks 
throughout the study . Participants who do not complete study activities may be contacted by 
email, text message, or push notifications with reminders to complete activities, within a time
window that is appropriate to the specific task, but will remain in the study sample regardless of
whether they submit data in a timely manner .
6.5. Compensation
Participants in both arms will be compensated for completing surveys. Participants in the CVD-I
will be compensated minimally for the completion of intervention tasks (e.g., completing short
quizzes, scheduling a date for their influenza vaccine, reading an article to learn more about the
flu, the flu shot, and their cardiovascular conditions), to avoid incentivizing vaccination status
unequally between the two arms. The compensation amounts will be detailed in the Data Usage 
& Permissions Agreements at the beginning of each survey for CVD-I and CVD-C arms, and in 
the of fer to complete the intervention messages for the CVD-I arm. All compensation will be 
awarded in Achievement Points, of which 100 points is equivalent to $0.10. Points can be 
redeemed for monetary compensation or donated to charitable or ganizations. The following 
compensation will be awarded: 50 points per intervention message completed, 3 points per
optional informational email requested, and 300 points per survey completed. The maximum 
number of points possible is 1,518 points, which could be redeemed for approximately $1.52.

8.Statistical Considerations

8.1. Sample Size Justification
We determined sample size for a two-arm interventional statistical superiority study design with
vaccination rates as the primary outcome of interest (Zhong 2009). Studies on the impact of
messaging and reminders to improve influenza vaccination rates show a range of ef fect sizes 
from 2.5 - 3.5% (Nehme et al., 2019, Hurley et al., 2018). As noted earlier , CDC reported 
vaccination rates are 47.9% for adults between the ages of 18 - 65.
Given these a-priori assumptions, we assumed dif ferent baseline vaccination rates of 35%, 50% 
and 60%, and then computed the sample size needed to detect an increase in vaccination rate of
2%, 3% and 4% respectively . Sample size for the dif ference in proportion is determined by 
(Zhong, 2009):
Where:

I and II error of 0.05 and 0.2 respectively ,

rate and ef fect size. We note that within each hypothesized ef fect size, changing assumptions 
about baseline vaccination rates do not substantially alter the sample size.
Based on this, we believe that a 3% ef fect size is a reasonable assumption and that a sample size 
of approximately 8000 participants will be needed to detect this dif ference with a type I error rate 
of 0.05 and a presumed power of 0.80. A participation dropof f of 67% has been observed for 
digital interventions for increasing influenza vaccination (i.e., Samson et al., 2020). Assuming 
between 67% to 75% dropof f for this study , we estimate that between 24,000 - 35,000 
participants will need to be recruited and randomized for this study . Based on these calculations, 
we plan to recruit approximately 35,000 participants.
8.2. Description of Analytical Plan
8.2.1. Baseline Descriptive Statistics
Descriptive statistics (e.g., mean, standard deviation, frequency and percentage) of study
participants will be reported for demographic variables (e.g., age, gender , education, income) and 
patient reported outcomes (e.g., vaccination rates). To confirm that block randomization is 
successful, we will compare the intervention to control groups in terms of baseline
demographics, vaccine drivers/barriers, and vaccine knowledge for each of the block groups
described earlier .
8.2.2. Analysis of Primary Endpoint
An intention to treat analysis will be conducted of the primary outcomes for the study . Assuming 
that a descriptive comparison of the intervention to control group does not demonstrate
statistically significant dif ferences in terms of demographics, vaccine drivers/barriers, or vaccine 
knowledge, we will report on the relative rate of influenza vaccination for the intervention group
compared to the control group. We will also conduct logistic regression modeling of influenza 
vaccination as follows:
𝑙𝑜𝑔𝑖𝑡(𝑌) =β0 +β1 𝑀 + ∑𝑗β𝑗α𝑗 + ε
Where:
logit(Y)
=
ln(Y/1-Y)
for the binary variable designation
of influenza vaccination status 
M
= the binary designation for Intervention (messaging)
vs Control (no messaging) 
α
j
= the baseline covariates measured in the study
(e.g. demographics, vaccine drivers/barriers or 
knowledge)
ε = 
the error term of the regression.
For the logistic regression model the p-values associated with each of the 
β 
parameter estimates 
will be reported.

8.2.3. Analysis of Secondary Endpoint
To examine dif ferences in vaccination rates between individuals in the CVD-I group and its 
relationship to engagement with intervention messages, we will model:
𝑙𝑜𝑔𝑖𝑡(𝑌) =β0 +β1 𝑀 + ∑𝑗β𝑗α𝑗+ ε
Where:
logit(Y)
=
ln(Y/1-Y)
for the binary variable designation

0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) 
α
j
= the baseline covariates measured in the study
(e.g. demographics, vaccine drivers/barriers, or 
knowledge)
To examine predictors of vaccination status, including cardiovascular condition type, vaccine
drivers/barriers, and vaccine knowledge, across CVD-I and CVD-C we will construct the model:
𝑙𝑜𝑔𝑖𝑡(𝑌) =β0 +β1 𝑃 + ∑𝑗β𝑗α𝑗 + ε
Where:
logit(Y)
=
ln(Y/1-Y)
for the binary variable designation
of influenza status 
C

= the binary designation Cardiovascular Condition
as described earlier 
P
= the predictor of interest (e.g. cardiovascular

knowledge index)
α
j
= the baseline covariates measured in the study
(e.g. demographics, vaccine drivers/barriers, or 
knowledge)
ε =

To examine predictors of vaccination status, including cardiovascular condition type, vaccine

Where:
logit(Y)
=
ln(Y/1-Y)
for the binary variable designation

To examine the potential impact of COVID-19 on vaccination rates, we will add  a term to the
model used in the primary analysis model:
Version 1
18
of
22
𝑙𝑜𝑔𝑖𝑡(𝑌) =β0 +β1 𝑀 + ∑𝑗β𝑗α𝑗 +β𝑐𝑐 +β𝑖𝑀*𝑐+ ε
Where the additional term
c
is the Covid-19 status
(1 if diagnosed with COVID-19, 0 if not) and 
the parameter estimate for the interaction term,
will be reported. Similarly , we can alsoβ𝑖 
evaluate the ef fect of COVID-19 attitudes towards influenza vaccination rates. In this case, the 
term
c
would represent COVID-19 attitudes (1 if the
participant reports more likely to vaccinate, 
0 if the person does not).
To describe self-reported complications from influenza experienced by individuals with dif ferent 
cardiovascular conditions during the 6-month study period, as well as dif ferences in 
complications by vaccination status, we will aggregate rates of self-reported complications by
cardiovascular conditions, as well as by vaccination status.
To examine dif ferences in wearable data (i.e., sleep, steps, heart rate) between individuals who 
experience influenza and those who do not, as well as dif ferences in wearable data between 
cardiovascular conditions, we will aggregate day-level wearable data over the entire study period
based on influenza status, as well as by cardiovascular condition.
Between-group comparisons of the outcomes described above (e.g. self reported complications
or mean daily steps) will be conducted with Student’ s t-tests or the non-parametric 
Mann-Whitney U test when appropriate, with correction for multiple testing using the
Benjamini-Hochber g approach for False Discovery Rate correction.
9.Data Security and Conﬁdentiality
All identifiable information about participants, their medical conditions, and other study data will
be secured by Evidation Health in accordance with all applicable local and state laws,
regulations, and IRB policies regarding collection and distribution of participant information.
Data will be transmitted using secure encrypted protocols and stored on encrypted disks on
secure and hardened servers. Administrative access to these servers is limited to only the 
necessary IT  staff at Evidation Health. Survey data may be stored for a minimum of 3 years, 
consistent with contract and applicable law .
Personally Identifiable Information (PII) is only accessible to a restricted set of individuals, and
is only used to distribute study material and for participant support purposes. PII will not be
disclosed unless required by regulatory agencies or the IRB in instances consistent with
applicable law . Limited Achievement clinical, research and technical team members at Evidation 
Health only have access to Coded Study Data where all PII is replaced with random unique
identifiers. Coded Study Data may also be transferred to external research partners, including
Sanofi Pasteur , in accordance with IRB approved uses.
10.Risks and Beneﬁts
Version 1
19
of
22
10.1. Potential Risks Associated with the Study
This is a minimal risk study that does not involve any risk beyond what a person would
experience in their daily life. While we strive to protect the privacy of personal information and 
implement appropriate safeguards, complete security cannot be guaranteed. There is the potential 
risk of loss of privacy associated with this study if another person sees the participant’ s survey 
responses on their phone or computer screen. Participants may decline to answer certain survey
questions.
10.2. Potential Benefits Associated with the Study
Participants of this study will likely not receive any direct benefit from the proposed research;
however , society and investigators will benefit from the knowledge gained. This information 
may contribute to public health and scientific ef forts related to vaccination and the prevention of 
disease for people with cardiovascular disorders. This information may help researchers develop 
further interventions to increase influenza vaccination.
10.3. Adverse Events
Adverse events will not be actively collected because no pharmaceutical product or medical
treatment will be provided or evaluated in this study . Spontaneously reported adverse events 
received by Evidation Health will be recorded per Evidation Health's Standard Operating
Procedures.
Any pharmacovigilance data pertaining to a Sanofi product potentially collected will be notified
by Evidation Health to Sanofi Pasteur Pharmacovigilance, who is working with Evidation on this
research project, through email (
CL-CPV -Receipt@sanofi.com
),
within 1 (one) working day for 
serious adverse events.
A “serious adverse event (SAE)” is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that at any
dose: 
●
Results in death, 
●
Is life threatening, (Note: the term “life-threatening” refers to an event/reaction in which
the patient was at risk of death at the time of the event/reaction; it does not refer to an
event/ reaction which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe), 
●
Requires inpatient hospitalization or results in prolongation of existing hospitalization, 
●
Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity , 
●
Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or 
●
Is a medically important event or reaction. Medical and scientific judgment should be
exercised in deciding whether other situations should be considered serious, such as
important medical events that might not be immediately life-threatening or result in death
or hospitalization, but might jeopardize the patient or might require intervention to
prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above.

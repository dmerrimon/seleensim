1. Abstract  
Although  mental  health  (MH)  and substance  use (SU)  disorders  are highly  prevalent  among  
HIV-positive  individuals,  they are under -recognized  and frequently  undertreated  or untreated.  
The overarching  hypothesis  for this project  is that that patient -reported  depressive , anxiety , or 
posttraumatic  stress  symptoms  and substance  use are important  predictors  of poor retention  in 
care and that a feasible,  clinic -based  approach  for responding  to positive  screening  tests for 
depressive , anxiety,  or posttraumat ic stress  symptoms  and substance  use will improve  
recognition  and treatment  of these  issues , and ultimately  retention  in HIV care.  This phase  of 
the project  is a feasibility  pilot of an intervention  to respond  to positive  screening  tests captured  
through  the Patient  Reported  Outcomes  questionnaires  (PROs ). The PROs  are currently  
performed  in the clinic , however,  the results  are not reviewed  with patients  or transmitted  to 
providers.  This pilot assess es the feasibility  of moving  the PROs  into the clinical  realm by 
having  patients  review  their PRO  results,  having  patients  identify  an issue  they would  like to 
discuss  with their provider,  and determining  whether  this process  increases  discussion  of MH 
and SU disorders  in the subsequent  clinical  visit and increas es referrals  to MH and/or  SU 
treatment .  
 
2. Objectives (include all primary and secondary objectives)  
Pilot -test whether PRO results being reviewed with patient and selectively transmitted to the 
provider influences 1) discussion  of MH and SU disorders  in the subsequent  clinical  visit 2) 
referrals  to MH and/or  SU treatment  3) depression/ anxiety /posttraumatic  stress  score  on 
subsequent  PRO  4)Substance  Use score  on subsequent  PRO . 
 
3. Background  (briefly describe  pre-clinical and clinical data, current experience with procedures, 
drug or device, and any other relevant information to justify the research )

Significance  
The benefits of antiretroviral therapy (ART) for improving clinical outcomes and prolonging life in 
HIV-positive individuals1-3 and in reducing HI V transmission to HIV -negative individuals4 are well -
known. In order to maximize ART benefit, patients must both access and remain fully engaged in HIV 
care. The HIV care continuum, previously referred to as the HIV treatment “cascade,” is series of steps 
necessary to achieve and maintain HIV suppression. These steps include testing and diagnosis, linking to 
care, being retained in care, being prescribed ART, and adhering to ART to achieve HIV suppression.6-8 
Among patients successfully retained in care in a multisite US cohort, 83% were prescribed ART, and 72% 
achieved viral suppression.9 However, as 
shown in Figure 1 (left), the largest 
“drop -off” in the continuum involves 
patients who link to care but are not 
retained in care, creating a large obstacle 
to viral suppression . 
Retention in care may be defined 
as remaining in medical care,10 and 
various metrics based on missed and kept 
HIV primary care visits have been 
proposed to measure retention. Patients 
who are not retained in care have higher 
risk of tre atment resistance, worse 
clinical outcomes, and higher mortality.11-
13 In addition, patients who are not 
retained in care and do not achieve viral 
suppression are more likely to transmit 
HIV to others,14 hindering efforts to 
reduce incidence rates in key s ub-
populations. Improving linkage to, and retention in, care is a primary goal of the White House National 
HIV/AIDS Strategy15 for the United States and a priority of the Department of Health and Human Services 
(DHHS) and its various agencies.16  
Mental he alth (MH) and substance use (SU) disorders are highly prevalent among HIV -positive 
individuals and are associated with worse HIV outcomes.  The lifetime prevalence of depression among 
HIV-positive individuals has been reported as high as 45%,17 with recent depressive symptoms endorsed by 
20-50% of patients.18-20 The prevalence of problematic drug and alcohol use is also high, reported in 10 -
40% of patients.21-26 Dual diagnosis is common; a large prevalence study demonstrated that 38% of HIV -
positive patients  had both  a mood and a SU disorder.27 MH/SU disorders among HIV -positive patients are 
associated with worse adherence to medication, appointment attendance, and other self -care.28-32 Previous 
studies have revealed an association between these disorders and  worse retention in care.33, 34 
There is inadequate treatment of depression and SU among HIV -positive patients, starting with 
under -recognition of these disorders. Pence and colleagues have described a “depression cascade” in 
HIV care,35 demonstrating subo ptimal depression outcomes. Prior research has demonstrated that effective 
depression and SU disorder treatment can improve HIV clinical outcomes.36-38 However, as in general 
primary care, depression is under -recognized39 and goes untreated or undertreated  in many HIV -positive 
patients.40,41 As a result, of all HIV -positive patients with depression, only 5% of the patients are estimated 
to achieve symptom remission.35 Among patients with SU disorders, both discussions with providers 
regarding SU and receipt  of SU disorder treatment are low.42 
Computer -assisted interviewing may lead to increased patient disclosure and provider recognition of 
MH/SU disorders. Standardized, practice -based screening using patient -reported outcomes (PROs), rather 
than typical cli nical care or chart review, increases identification of MH disorders.43 There are many

 potential benefits to using computer -assisted screening to increase patient reporting of MH/SU disorders. 
Routine use of patient reporting may enhance patient -provider c ommunication. Furthermore, it may 
increase provider recognition of these problems and appropriate treatment and/or referral. Computer -
assisted screening has been shown to have high acceptability in HIV clinics.44, 45 There are potential 
barriers to clinica l use of these screening measures, however, including clinic space considerations, 
increased staff burden, and competing priorities for both patients and providers.46 To increase chances of 
success, PRO data must be integrated into clinic flow in a patient - and provider -friendly manner, with high 
perceived value of the information to providers.47 
Increased recognition of MH/SU disorders is the first step in improved care. Standardized screening, 
by itself, is insufficient to improve patient outcomes.48 Screening for depressive and anxiety symptoms in 
primary care is only recommended by the USPSTF when services for accurate diagnosis, treatment and 
follow up are available.49 HIV primary care guidelines emphasize the importance of developing  a 
management plan  when MH/SU issues are identified.50  Following  a positive screen for depressive 
symptoms, a comprehensive MH assessment must be performed, followed by the provision of treatment 
when necessary, either in the primary care setting or through referral to a MH specialist.51 For SU 
disorders, a positive screen should lead to additional assessment, and then brief intervention and/or referral 
to specialty treatment.52 In a prior study using PRO screening for depressive symptoms in an HIV clinic 
with referral to psychiatric care only for patients screening positive, only 46% of patients received 
subsequent MH treatment.28 Therefore, the proposed intervention will not only aim to increase 
identification of these disorders but also to implement standardized response s to improve uptake of 
treatment of these disorders and retention in HIV care.  
Summary: Significance  
Improving retention in care is a crucial component of addressing the domestic HIV epidemic. Inadequate 
recognition and treatment of MH/SU disorders hinder s retention efforts.  A feasible, acceptable clinic -based 
intervention to increase identification and treatment of individuals with MH/SU disorders may have a n 
impact on retention in care .  
 
4. Study Procedures  
a. Study design, including the sequence and timing o f study procedures    
(Distinguish  research procedures from those that are part of routine care ). 
 
Patients will be scheduled for their semiannual PRO and asked to come early to complete PRO. 
Because the PRO cannot be administered by phone, telephone screen ing is not possible and 
screening will be performed in person. When potentially eligible subjects arrive, t hey will 
complete a screening consent  form. Screening will consist of completing their regularly 
scheduled PRO  questionnaire. Following completion of  the PRO,  the PRO will be scored in 
real-time to determine if the potential participant has a positive screen for a MH or SU issue. 
The MH screens are for depressive symptoms , anxiety symptoms , and posttraumatic stress 
symptoms ; the SU screens assess wheth er the potential patient is currently using alcohol, 
opiates, cocaine, or amphetamines.  All potential subjects will receive $5 for completing 
screening.  
 
Individuals with positive MH or SU screen will be eligible for enrollment. The potential 
participant  will be offered participation, and if he/she is interested, an informed consent 
discussion will be conducted.  
Participants will be given the opportunity to determine which positive screen, if any, he/she 
would like to discuss with his/her provider for di scussion at the next HIV primary care 
appointment. He/she will be notified that  all positive screen s will be shared with the provider 
prior to their next HIV primary care visit , and that any positive screen the patient has chosen to 
discuss with their prov ider will be specified . The patient’s provider will receive the PRO s result 
 
 
JHMIRB eF ormA   01

Page 4 of 9 
 (score, interpretation , and recommendation ) prior to their next HIV primary care visit . This 
information will be conveyed to the provider by a written note in the patient’s Epic ch art that 
will be part of the clinical documentation for that encounter   placed by the Principal Investigator 
for the study (Anne Monroe, MD).  
 
Participants will complete a brief questionnaire evaluating their satisfaction with the 
intervention.  
Outcome ass essment : The subsequent HIV primary care visit will be audio -recorded . 
Transcribed audio recordings will be  analyzed to assess whether a discussion of SU/MH  issues 
occurs and whether a referral  for SU/MH treatment  is made . 
 
 
For all participants, results o f all of the PROs will be saved into the study database. 
Demographic  and clinical  characteristics (sex, race, age, years since HIV diagnosis, and years  in 
care at Hopkins HIV clinic , as well as details re: MH/SU treatment ) for all participants will be 
obtained from the medical record  or by asking patients directly (see Demographic Questionnaire 
form for reference) .  
 
Patients enrolled in the Johns Hopkins HIV Clinical Cohort (JHHCC):   
Patients  enrolled in the JHHCC  participate in PRO completion every 6 mont hs. Any JHHCC 
participant who is due for a PRO assessment is eligible for the study.  
 
Providers  at the Moore Clinic :  
The pilot study will offer participation to all HIV providers at the Moore Clinic. We anticipate 
about 32 providers will enroll in the st udy. If a provider does not consent to the pilot study, this 
provider’s patients will be ineligible. The next HIV primary care visit with a patient enrolled in 
the study will be audio -recorded.  
 
In an effort to be collaborative and efficient in the resear ch process, if both a patient and 
provider are enrolled in the study Maximizing Respect and Improving Patient Outcomes in HIV 
and Substance Abuse (MaRIPOHSA) (IRB protocol number: IRB00047417), we will 
collaborate with the MaRIPOHSA study team and use reco rdings from the MaRIPOPHSA visit 
to capture this study’s intervention (our team members have all been approved by the IRB to be 
included on the IRB approval for MaRIPOHSA).  
 
b. Study duration and number of study visits required of research participant s. 
Parti cipants will complete 1 clinical research visit and 1 HIV primary care visit. The length of 
time will vary depending on the duration of time between a clinical research visit and the next 
HIV primary care visit. This will typically occur on the same day or  within a week.  
 
Providers will be enrolled in this study from the time they consent until their next clinical visit 
per patient enrolled. The number of visits audio -recorded for each provider will depend on how 
many of the provider’s patients consent to participating in the pilot study.  
 
c. Blinding, including justification for blinding or not blinding the trial, if applicable.  
This pilot study will not include blinding, as participants will consent to participate and will be 
aware of the intervention in or der to consent, thereby making it unfeasible to blind patients or 
providers.  
 
d. Justification o f why participant s will not receive routine  care or will have current therapy 
stopped.

5. Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria  
Inclusion:  
Patients:  
Patients who are living with HIV, attend the Moore Clinic, are enrolled in the JH HCC and are due 
to complete the  PRO s assessment within the current JHHCC research structure are offered 
participati on. Patients are eligible if they are 18 years or older and English speaking.  
 
Providers:  
Clinic personnel, including  physicians , nurse practitioners , and physician assistants , who are the 
primary care provider for a patient who has consented and enrolled  in the pilot study.  
 
Exclusion:  
Exclusion criteria for patients include: n ot willing or able to provide informed consent ,patients who 
do not score positive on a MH/SU PRO measure, and  primary care provider has not consented to 
the study.  
 
6. Drugs/ Substa nces/ Devices  
a. This does not apply.  
 
7. Study Statistics  
a. Primary outcome variable . 
The primary  care visit immediately  following  the completion  of the JHHCC  research  visit will 
be audio -recorded  using  a digital  recorder.  Audio -recordings  will be transcribed  verbatim;  only 
names  of participants  or other  named  individuals  will be redacted.  Transcription  will be 
performed  on a rolling  basis  as the interviews  are completed.  The primary  care visits  will 
analyze  the following  primary  outcome  variables.  First , the recorded visits  will allow  us to 
compare  provider  discussion  of SU and/or  MH issue . Second , the recorded  visits  will allow  us 
to use qualitative  methods  to analyze  the structure  of the clinical  visit (e.g. what  health  issue  
became  the priority,  dominant  point  of discussion,  major  outcomes)  related  to SU/MH  in the 
intervention  group  compared  to the control  group.  Third , we will analyze  referrals  or treatment  
plans  for SU and/or  MH as documented  in Epic that resulted  from  the recorded  primary  care 
visit.   
 
b. Second ary outcome variables . 
N/A 
c. Statistical plan including sample size justification and inte rim data analysis.  
 
We will fit mixed -effects  logistic  regression  models  for dichotomous  variables  (discussion  of 
MH/SU  at visit Y/N,  referral  for MH/SU  care Y/N).     
 
 
 
JHMIRB eF ormA   01

Page 6 of 9 
 The sample size (n60 patient  participants ) will allow for adequate determination of  the 
feasibility of the intervention and to estimate effect size to justify a larger multisite RCT of this 
strategy.  
  
d. Early stopping rules.  
N/A  
 
8. Risks  
a. Medical risks, list ing all procedures, their major and minor risks and expected frequency.  
The potential  risks  are low, but include  loss of confidentiality , potential  discomfort,  and 
boredom  or inconvenience  for participating .  
 
b. Steps taken to minimize the risks.  
We will inform patients  and providers  that they may withdraw  at anytime.  Additionally,  all 
participants  will receive  a study  identification  number , so their personal  information  is not 
linked  to the PROs  score  and audio  recording.   
 
c. Plan for reporting unanticipated p roblems or study deviations.  
Unanticipated  problems  or study  deviations  will be reported  to the IRB,  the NIH,  and if 
applicable  to all study  participants  in a letter.  
 
d. Legal risks such as the risks that would be associated with breach of confidentiality.  
We will ensure  protection  of the medical  records  and personal  health  information.  Only  the 
principal  investigator  and the research  coordinator/assistant  will have  access  to patient’s  
identifying  information.   All data will be held confidential  and stored  in locked  files,  accessible  
to authorized  staff and investigators  only.  Audio  files will be downloaded  to secure  servers  that 
are password  protected.  After  completion  of the study  and data analysis,  these  files will be 
destroyed.  All staff members  have  compl eted the IRB certification  so they are all aware  of the 
importance  of patient  confidentiality.  All newly  hired  staff will not be allowed  access  to any 
study  information  until they have  completed  and passed  all IRB human  subjects  research  
certification  exam inations.  
 
e. Financial risks to the participant s. 
Not applicable  
 
 
9. Benefits  
a. Description of the probable benefits  for the participant and for society . 
 
There is no direct benefit for study participants in this aim.  We seek to fill an important  gap 
in knowledg e regarding  successful  interventions  to increase  engagement  and retention  in 
HIV care.  Retention  is crucial  to improve  clinical  outcomes  for HIV-positive  patients  and to 
decrease  HIV transmission.  We believe  that the risks  to subjects  are low and reasonabl e give 
the anticipated  benefits.  
 
10. Payment and Remuneration  
a. Detail compensation for participant s including possible total compensation, proposed bonus, 
and any proposed reductions or penalties for not completing the protocol.  
Patients:  
Patients who consent  to screening for this study: $5.00 remuneration. Patients will receive 
an additional $15.00 compensation to have their routine clinical care audio -recorded. The 
 
 
JHMIRB eF ormA   01 
Version 3 Dated:   06/2007   
Page 7 of 9 
 total potential compensation for patients who both screen positive on their PRO assessment 
and decide to enroll in the study is $20.00.  
Providers:  
Total potential compensation for provider  who consent to the study is $100 .00 (per provider 
enrolled) for participation in audio -recording routine clinical visits.   
 
11. Costs  
a. Detail costs of study proced ure(s) or drug (s) or substance(s) to participant s and identify 
who will pay for them.  
All study procedures will be free to participants.

Study Product(s), Dose, Route, 
Regimen Arm A:  
Gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 IV  
Cisplatin 25 mg/m2 IV  Nivolumab 360 mg IV  
 
Arm B:  
Nivolumab 240 mg IV  
Ipilimumab 1 mg/kg  
Duration of Administration Patients may be treated on study for no longer than 2 years.  Arm A: If patient has stable disease a fter 8 cycles, then gemcitabine/cisplatin 
will be discontinued and patient will continue single agent nivolumab at 240 mg IV every 2 weeks, in absence of dise ase progression or unacceptable toxicity.
  
 
Arm B: The patient can continue nivo lumab and ipilimumab every 2 weeks in 
absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.  
Statistical 
Methodology The trial is sized to compare each randomized treatment arm to a historical value for PFS in this patient population receiving standard treatment. The PFS proportion in this patient population at 6 months is 59%. Using this value as the 
null hypothesis, we hope to see an increase in the proportion of alive, 
progression-free patients to 80% or above in each of the combination arms.  Thirty-two patients evaluable for the 6- month PFS endpoint are required to test 
this hypothesis with >80% power and at  most 5% type I error (1-sided).  A 
maximum of 64 evaluable patients will be enrolled.

 1.0 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE 
1.1 Biliary Tract Cancer - Disease Overview 
Biliary tract cancer (BTC) develops as a result  of malignant transformation of the biliary 
tract mucosa and is anatomically classifi ed as intra-hepatic, extra-hepatic (hilar and 
distal) and gall bladder adenocarcinoma. BTC ac counts for 10-15% of all primary liver 
cancer cases worldwide, and its incidence is rising (Shaib, Davila et al. 2004).  Advanced 
BTCs are aggressive tumors with median surv ival time from diagnosis of less than 12 
months (Valle, Wasan et al. 2010), and five-y ear overall survival (OS) of ~5% despite 
therapy (Nathan, Pawlik et al. 2007). The opt ions for systemic chemotherapy for patients 
with advanced BTC remains limited with only a few meaningful improvements made over 
the past few decades. Valle et al randomly assigned 410 patients with locally advanced 
or metastatic BTC to receive gemcitabine with  or without cisplatin in the phase III ABC-02 
trial (Valle, Wasan et al. 2010). Patients on the gemcitabine cisplatin arm demonstrated 
an improvement in OS (11.7 versus 8.1 months ; hazard ratio (HR), 0.64; 95% CI, 0.52 to 
0.80; p>0.001) as compared to the gemcitabi ne alone arm. The following clinically 
relevant grade 3 and 4 adverse events were  noted in the gemcitabine/cisplatin arm: 
neutropenia (25.3%), anemia (7.6%), thromboc ytopenia (15.7%), abnormal liver function 
(16.7%), fatigue (18.7%), nausea (4%), vomiting (5.1%), impaired renal function (1.5%), 
infection (18.2%), deep vein thrombosis (2%), and thromboembolic event (3.5%).  This 
result established the gemcitabine and cisplatin combination as a standard first line 
regimen for patients with advanced BTC.  
1.2 Role of Checkpoint Inhibitors in BTC 
T-cell activation requires dual signaling from the T-cell receptor and an additional co-stimulatory molecule (Peggs, Quezada et al. 2006, Robert and Ghiringhelli 2009). The 
first signal includes binding of the T-cell re ceptor to antigens presented by antigen 
presenting cells (APCs). Subsequently, the B7  (CD80, CD86) ligand binds to CD28 which 
is a co-stimulatory receptor. This signaling l eads to T-cell proliferation, cytokine release 
and upregulation of the immune response. As a result, cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4 
(CTLA-4) is upregulated and competes with the CD28 receptor for B7 binding. CTLA-4 
has higher affinity than the CD28 receptor and therefore T-cell response is ultimately 
down-regulated. PD-1 is a member of the CD28/CTLA-4 family of T-cell costimulatory 
receptors that includes CD28, CTLA-4, IC OS and BTLA (Freeman, Long et al. 2000). PD-
1 is expressed on activated T cells, B cells and myeloid cells (Nishimura and Honjo 2001). There are 2 ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2 t hat are specific for PD-1. Once they bind 
to PD-1, down-regulation of T-cell activation occurs (Latchman, Wood et al. 2001, Carter, 
Fouser et al. 2002). When the PD-1 ligand bind s to the PD-1 receptor, T-cell activation is 
blocked. CTLA-4 and PD-1 are negative r egulators of T-cell re sponse that prevent 
autoimmunity and allows tolerance to self-antigens (Peggs, Quezada et al. 2006). If these interactions are interrupted, the checkpoint  is turned off which can lead to enhanced 
antitumor T-cell activation. 
 
Nivolumab (Opdivo™), a fully human immunoglobulin G4 programmed death-1 (PD-1) 
immune checkpoint inhibitor antibody, binds wi th high affinity to PD-1 receptors on T 
cells, blocking their interaction with PD ligands 1 and 2 (PD-L1/PD-L2) and restoring T-
cell antitumor function (Rizvi, Hellmann et al . 2016). Twenty-three PD-L1 positive patients 
with advanced BTC were enrolled in the KEYN OTE-028 phase 1b trial of pembrolizumab 
(another anti-PD-1 antibody) monotherapy.  Within this cohort of heavily pretreated 
patients, an ORR of 17.4% (N=4; 95% CI, 5. 0-38.8) was demonstrated and an additional 
4 patients had stable disease for a disease cont rol rate of 35% (Bang, Doi et al. 2015). At 
the time of this report, the median response duration had not yet been reached (range, 5.4+ to 9.3+ weeks). Adverse events were ge nerally consistent with previously reported 
safety data for pembrolizumab. There were no treatment-related deaths. Five patients,

 including all responders, remain on treatment more than 40 weeks (Bang, Doi et al. 
2015).  
 Ipilimumab (Yervoy™) is a fully human monoclonal immunoglobulin (Ig) G1κ  specific for 
human CTLA-4. Ipilimumab binds to CTLA-4 and inhibits its interaction with B7 ligands (CD80, CD86) on APCs which can augment T- cell activation and proliferation, including 
the activation and proliferation of tumor infilt rating T-effector cells. Inhibition of CTLA-4 
signaling can also reduce T-regulatory cell function, which may contribute to a general 
increase in T cell responsiveness, including the anti-tumor immune response (Ipilimumab 
Investigator Brochure, 2015). While the to xicity and clinical responses overlap, 
mechanisms of immune activation and range of responses appear to be different for ipilimumab and nivolumab. Preclinical data suggests the combination of nivolumab and 
ipilimumab enhances T-cell antitumor activity . This combination is FDA approved in 
patients with melanoma, and is being currently investigated in patients with non-small cell 
lung cancer ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]), bladder cancer ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]), advanced solid tumors ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]), pancreatic cancer ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) and hepatocellular carcinoma 
([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]).  
Melanoma.  The combination of nivolumab plus ipilimumab was investigated in a phase III 
clinical trial in untreated melanoma and showed improved median progression-free 
survival (11.5 months; 95% CI, 8.9 to 16.7 months) compared to nivolumab or ipilimumab 
alone (P<.001) [12]. The most frequent treatment-related select adverse events of grade 
3 or 4 were diarrhea (in 2.2% of patients in  the nivolumab group, 9.3% of those in the 
nivolumab-plus-ipilimumab group, and 6.1% of  those in the ipilimumab group), colitis (in 
0.6%, 7.7%, and 8.7%, respectively), and incr eased alanine aminotransferase level (in 
1.3%, 8.3%, and 1.6%, respectively) (L arkin, Chiarion-Sileni et al. 2015) .  
 
Small cell lung cancer (SCLC).  CheckMate-032 is a phase 1/2 open-label trial, evaluating 
the safety and efficacy of nivolumab monotherapy, or nivolumab combined 
with ipilimumab , in advanced or metastatic solid tu mors at different doses and schedules. 
The CheckMate-032 SCLC cohort included 180 patients with progressive disease after 
one or more prior lines of therapy, includ ing a first-line platinum-based chemotherapy 
regimen. In this analysis, patients received nivolumab monotherapy 3 mg/kg 
administered intravenously every two weeks, or nivolumab 1 mg/kg plus ipilimumab 3 
mg/kg, every three weeks for four cycles followed by nivolumab  3 mg/kg every two 
weeks. All patients were treated until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The 
confirmed objective response rate (primary objective) was 31% (n=14/45) in patients who received nivolumab plus ipilimumab  and was 13% (n=7/55) with nivolumab alone .
 Grade 
3–4 treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) occurred in 11% of pts in nivolumab alone arm, and 32% of patients in the nivolumab 1mg/kg + ipilimumab 3mg/kg arm; 5% and 13% discontinued due to TRAEs, respectively . One TR death due to myasthenia gravis 
occurred in the combination arm (Antonia, Lopez-Martin et al. 2016). 
 
Renal cell cancer (RCC) . In the CheckMate-016 study, patients with metastatic RCC 
were randomized to either nivolumab 3 mg/kg + ipilimumab 1mg/kg (n=47) or nivolumab 1 mg/kg + ipilimumab 3 mg/kg (n=47). After a m edian follow-up of 22 months, the overall 
response rate was 40% in each arm, with median PFS of 6.6 months with nivolumab 3 + 
ipilimumab 1 and 9.1 months with nivolumab 1 + ipilimumab 3. Less frequent grade 3/4 
treatment-related adverse effects were reported with nivolumab 3 + ipilimumab 1 compared with nivolumab 1 + ipilimumab 3 (38% vs 62%). The most common 
were ↑ lipase (15% vs 28%), ↑ ALT (4% vs 21%), diarrhea (4% vs 15%), ↑ AST (4% vs 
13%), and colitis (0% vs 15%) respectively. The most common grade 3–4 select treatment-related AEs were gastrointestinal  (4% vs 23%) and hepatic (6% vs 21%) 
respectively. High dose ipilimumab showed dose -related toxicity, which further supports 
development of nivolumab 3 mg/kg + ipilimumab 1mg/kg in the first-line setting (Hammers, Plimack et al. 2016).

 1.3 Role of Chemotherapy in Conjunction with Checkpoint Inhibitors 
Chemotherapy has been shown to lead to t he upregulation of PD-L1 expression (Peng, 
Hamanishi et al. 2015). In addition, chemotherapy can enhance tumor antigen 
presentation by upregulating the production of  tumor neoantigens, or expression of the 
MHC class I molecules to which these antigens bind. Alternatively, chemotherapy may upregulate co-stimulatory molecules (e.g. B7-1) or downregulate co-inhibitory molecules (e.g. PD-L1/B7-H1 or B7-H 4) expressed on the tumor cell surface, enhancing the 
strength of effector T-cell activity. Chemotherapy may also render tumor cells more sensitive to T cell–mediated lysis thro ugh fas-, perforin-, and Granzyme B–dependent 
mechanisms (Emens and Middleton 2015). Gemcitabine is an example of an 
immunomodulatory chemotherapeutic agent with pleiotropic immune effects. 
Gemcitabine induces tumor cell apoptosis and enhances cross-priming of CD8+ T cells in 
animal models (Nowak, Lake et al. 2003). It also  reverses defective cross-presentation of 
tumor antigens by tumor-infiltrating dendritic cells (McDonnell, Lesterhuis et al. 2015). 
Cisplatin is another immunomodulatory chemot herapeutic agent that has been showed to 
stimulate tumor infiltration of inflammatory APC s expressing relatively high levels of T-cell 
so-stimulatory ligands (e.g. B7).  
The immunogenic properties of conventional  chemotherapy and rapid emergence of 
chemotherapy resistance provide a good rationale for combining gemcitabine plus 
cisplatin with immunotherapy, particularly i mmune checkpoint inhibitors. CheckMate 012, 
a phase I, multicohort study, was conducted to explore the safety and efficacy of 
nivolumab as monotherapy or combined wi th current standard therapies in first-line 
advanced non-small cell lung cancer. Patients (n = 56) received nivolumab plus platinum-
doublet concurrently every 3 weeks for four cycles followed by nivolumab alone until progression or unacceptable toxicity. Regimens were nivolumab 10 mg/kg plus gemcitabine-cisplatin (squamous) or pemetr exed-cisplatin (nonsquamous) or nivolumab 
5 or 10 mg/kg plus paclitaxel-carboplatin (all histologies). The primary objective was to assess safety and tolerability. Secondary objectives included objective response rate and 24-week progression-free survival rate. The objective response rates for nivolumab 10 
mg/kg plus gemcitabine-cisplatin was 33% along with progression-free and overall 
survival rates of 51% and 25% at 2 years, respectively (Rizvi, Hellmann et al. 2016).  
1.4 Rationale 
Patients with advanced, unresectable or me tastatic BTC have a poor prognosis despite 
systemic chemotherapy. The median PFS with first-line gemcitabine and cisplatin is 
expected to be 8 months. The immunogenic properties of conventional chemotherapy 
and rapid emergence of chemotherapy resist ance provide a good rationale for combining 
chemotherapy with immunotherapy, particularly immune checkpoint inhibitors (Rizvi, Hellmann et al. 2016). Monotherapy with pembrolizumab, another anti PD-1 antibody, 
has demonstrated activity in patients with heavily pre-treated, advanced BTC. 
Additionally, inhibition of CTLA-4 signaling via ipilimumab can also reduce T-regulatory 
cell function, and the combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab has been shown to 
improve clinical efficacy in several solid cancers in comparison with anti PD-1 alone.  
Therefore, we hypothesize that PD-1 recept or inhibition in combination with systemic 
chemotherapy, or ipilimumab will improve the progression-free and overall survival in this 
population without increasing toxicity. These results are expected to have an important 
positive impact because they will provide a strong evidence-guided understanding of BTC 
microenvironment and identification of potential biomarkers of response (and resistance) 
to inform a phase III clinical trial of immunotherapy in BTC.  
1.5 Correlative Studies 
We will study the BTC tumor microenvironment  through the use of pre-treatment tissue 
(all sites) as well as on-treatment (for patients at University of Michigan) and post-

 treatment (optional for patients enrolled at all sites) tumor biopsies. In addition, blood will 
be collected as detailed in the schedule of events/study calendar. Identification of 
important biologic subsets of BTC patients that  may have clinical efficacy from nivolumab 
and ipilimumab will be the overarching goal of these translational studies along with developing biologic insights for future therapeutic development. Biologic readouts for PD-
1 and CTLA4 response biomarkers will be asse ssed along with specific markers of tumor 
infiltrating leukocytes (TILs). Biologic ma rkers and RNA expression will be examined in 
the context of immunologic correlates, tumor biology, and therapeutic efficacy.  
2.0 STUDY OBJECTIVES 
2.1 Primary Objectives 
2.1.1 Determine the PFS rate at 6 months in patients with advanced BTC treated with 
nivolumab, gemcitabine and cisplati n, or nivolumab and ipilimumab 
2.2 Secondary Objectives  
2.2.1 Evaluate the ORR, median PFS and OS of patients with advanced BTC. 
 
2.2.2 Evaluate the safety of nivolumab in combination with gemcitabine and cisplatin, 
or ipilimumab in this patient population. 
2.3 Exploratory Objectives 
2.3.1 To explore predictors of biomarker response and mechanisms of resistance 
based on the exploratory analysis of tumor tissue obtained through serial 
biopsies and blood. 
a) Levels of PD-L1 (B7-H1), PD-L2, CTLA-4, T cell subset, myeloid-derived 
cell subset infiltration by immunohistoc hemistry (IHC) at baseline (for all 
patients), at 2 months and progression (for patients enrolled at University 
of Michigan) 
b) Whole exome genomic and transcriptomic (RNAseq) analysis for tumor 
biology and immune signature at baseline and progression  
c) PBMC collection for immune cell subset analysis including serum for 
future biomarker analysis 
2.4 Endpoints Assessment 
2.4.1 Primary Endpoint Assessment: The progression-free survival (PFS) will be 
defined as time from date of treatment to date of radiological or clinical 
progression (leading to withdrawal from  the study), or death from any cause, 
whichever comes first. Follow-up time will be censored at the date of last disease 
evaluation. 
 
2.4.2 Secondary Endpoint Assessment: 	Overall response rate (ORR) will be 
determined as per the combined RECISTv1.1 and irRECIST criteria. Overall 
survival (OS) will be defined from the date of treatment to either date of death or 
censoring. Adverse events and reportable serious events are defined by the 
study protocol (NCI Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) 
v4.03).

Page 15 of 64 
 determined, a copy of the completed Eligibility Worksheet together with all the pertinent de-
identified source documents will be submitted by t he requesting site to the Coordinating Center, 
by email to     
 
A Multi-Site Coordinator of the Coordinating Cent er, who acts as the registrar, will review the 
submitted documents and process the registration. Sites should inform the Multi-Site Coordinator 
of a potential registration by 5 p.m. on the day prior to registration.  Same day registrations 
cannot be guaranteed.    The registrar will send an email to the requesting site registrar to confirm pat ient registration and 
randomization and to provide the study identif ication number and randomization number assigned 
to the patient. In addition, a copy of the comp leted Eligibility Worksheet signed and dated by the 
registrar will be sent back to the requesting site registrar.  Patients found to be ineligible for participati on after being consented will be considered screen 
failures, and documented as such in the Screening and Enrollment Log. These patients will not have study identification number assigned to  them, and will not receive study treatment.

 5.0 TREATMENT PLAN 
5.1 Treatment Dosage and Administration 
Protocol treatment must start within  14 calendar days of randomization otherwise the 
patient will be taken off stud y. Re-screening is allowed. 
5.1.1 Arm A:  Nivolumab once every 3 weeks in combination with gemcitabine and 
cisplatin was evaluated in the CheckMate 012 trial in non-small cell lung cancer 
(Rizvi, Hellmann et al. 2016). The safety profile of nivolumab plus gemcitabine 
and cisplatin is consistent with that expected for individual agents. Nivolumab 
360 mg every 3 week dose has/is being investigated in multiple clinical trials in 
combination with chemotherapy for ease of administration ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED], 
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED] and [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]).

nivolumab may be continued alone at 240 mg IV ev ery 2 weeks. If the patient has stable disease 
on imaging after 8 cycles, then they will disc ontinue gemcitabine and cisplatin, and continue 
single agent nivolumab at 240 mg IV every 2 week s, in absence of disease progression or 
unacceptable toxicity. 
2 Infusion times may be extended as needed for safety (e.g. infusion reaction occurs). These 
instances should be documented in the patient medical records. 
3 As per section 5.6, patients may not be  treated on study for longer than 2 years.

 5.1.2 Arm B. Nivolumab and ipilimumab combination has been studied in multiple 
cancers and is FDA approved for melanoma. The safety profile of nivolumab plus 
ipilimumab is consistent with that ex pected for individual agents (Larkin, 
Chiarion-Sileni et al. 2015). Nivolumab 240 mg every 2 week dose is FDA 
approved for use in renal cell carcinoma, metastatic melanoma and non-small 
cell lung cancer.

5.2 Toxicities and Dosing Delays/Dose Modifications 
Any patient who receives treatment on this pr otocol will be evaluable for toxicity. Each 
patient will be assessed for the development of  toxicity according to the Time and Events 
Table (Section 6.4). Toxicity will be assess ed according to the NCI Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), vers ion 4.0.3. Dose adjustments should be made 
according to the system showing t he greatest degree of toxicity.

 5.2.1 All dose reductions will be perm anent unless otherwise noted.  
5.2.2 If more than one toxicity occurs requiring  dose reduction, the dose administered 
should be based on the most severe toxicity.  
5.2.3 Treatment delay of more than 28 days from  last intended therapy will result in 
treatment discontinuation.  
5.2.4 If one of the drugs is discontinued due to toxicity attributed to that agent, the 
patient will be allowed to continue a modified regimen with the remaining study 
arm agent/s. For Arm A however, monotherapy with cisplatin is not permitted, 
though monotherapy with gemcitabine is allowed. Additionally, if both gemcitabine and cisplatin are held, then also hold nivolumab. If both gemcitabine 
and cisplatin are discontinued, then nivo lumab may be continued alone at 240 
mg. 
5.2.5 Nivolumab and/or ipilimumab cannot be dose reduced in response to toxicity, and can only be discontinued as per detailed algorithms for immune-therapy toxicity management in Appendix III.  
5.2.6 Patients on Arm B may be allowed to continue nivolumab monotherapy if toxicity is deemed related to ipilimumab and deemed safe to continue as per the treating investigator.  
5.2.7 Investigators should consider dose re-calculation of gemcitabine and/or cisplatin with change in BSA as per standard of ca re/institutional guidelines. However, a 
change in BSA by 10% or more should lead to a dose re-calculation.  
5.2.8 Investigators should consider dose re-calculation of ipilimumab with change in weight as per standard of care/institutional guidelines. However, a change in weight by 10% or more should lead to a dose re-calculation.  
5.2.9 Missed Dose: If the regimen held or missed was to be given on Day 1 then that next cycle will not be considered to start until the day the first dose is actually 
administered. Held doses of either or both gemcitabine and cisplatin on Day 8 will be considered omitted.

reduction. 
 Note: Laboratory abnormalities that are not directly attributabl e to treatment (i.e., hyperglycemi a) or not clinically relevant  (i.e., lymphopenia) do not 
require modification of dosing. All dose adjustments for toxici ty of gemcitabine and/or cisplatin will be described in the clin ical record.

5.3 Management Algorithms for Immuno-Oncology Agents 
Nivolumab and ipilimumab are associated with immune related adverse events 
secondary to the unrestrained T cell activation. Management algorithms have been 
developed to assist investigators in asse ssing and managing the following groups of 
adverse events: 
 
Gastrointestinal 
Renal Pulmonary 
Hepatic 
Endocrinopathies 
Skin 
Neurological  
Wherever possible, timely confirmation of initial liver-related laboratory abnormalities 
should occur prior to the reporting of a potent ial drug-induced liver injury (DILI) event. All 
occurrences of potential DILIs, meeting t he defined criteria in Appendix III must be 
reported as SAEs.  
 Please refer to Appendix III for algorithm details. 
5.4 Concomitant Medications/Treatments 
The following concomitant medications or tr eatments are not permitted while the patient 
is currently receiving therapy on the protocol: 
 Other investigational agents 
 Immunosuppressive medications, including systemic corticosteroids, excluding 
prophylactic use of steroids  per institutional protocol. 
 Concurrent radiation 
5.5 Other Modalities or Procedures 
None 
5.6 Duration of Therapy 
Treatment may continue for a total of 2 years (discontinue gemcitabine/cisplatin in Arm A 
after 8 cycles) or until one of the following criteria apply: 
 Disease progression as defined in Section 7.0 
 Inter-current illness that  prevents further administration of treatment 
 Unacceptable adverse event(s) 
 Patient voluntarily with draws from treatment OR 
 General or specific changes in the patient’s condition render the patient 
unacceptable for further treatment in the judgment of the investigator 
5.7 Off Treatment Criteria  
Patients will be removed from pr otocol therapy when any of t he criteria listed in Section 
5.6 apply. Document in the source the reason for ending protocol therapy and the date 
the patient was removed from treatment. A ll patients who discontinue treatment should 
comply with protocol specific follow-up proc edures as outlined in Section 5.8. The only 
exception to this requirement is when a subject withdraws co nsent for all study 
procedures or loses the ability to consent freely.  
Protocol UMCC 2017.026 
________________________________________________________________________ 
Page 22 of 64 
 5.8 Duration of Follow-Up 
After treatment discontinuation, follow-up for survival and initiation of any other anti-
cancer therapies will be documented every 3 months via telephone or office visit documentation for up to 2 years from treatm ent discontinuation or until death, whichever 
comes first, or 3 years after first date of tr eatment initiation for those that remain on 
treatment. Patients removed from treatment for unacceptable adverse events will be followed until resolution or stabilization of the adverse event.  
5.9 Off Study Criteria 
Patients can be taken off study at any time at their own request, or they may be withdrawn at the discretion of the investigator for safety, behavioral or administrative 
reasons. The reason(s) for discontinuation from study  will be documented and may 
include: 
5.9.1 Patient withdraws consent (termination of treatment and follow-up);  
5.9.2 Patient becomes pregnant;  
5.9.3 Loss of ability to freely provide consent  through imprisonment or involuntary 
incarceration for treatment; 
5.9.4 Termination of the study by the Sponsor-Investigator, or the FDA;  
5.9.5 Patient completes protocol treatment and follow-up criteria; 
5.10 Patient Replacement 
All patients who receive at least one dose of  study therapy will be considered evaluable.   
 
Patients enrolled in the study will be considered non-evaluable under the following case 
scenarios and replaced by additional patients:  
1. Patients who received no investigational therapy. 
 
2. Patients who withdrew consent for study t herapy prior to first response evaluation. 
 
3. Patients meeting off study criteria 5.9.2 and 5.9.3.  
 
6.0 STUDY PROCEDURES

Immunotherapy drugs such as nivolumab and ipilimumab can initially cause inflammation 
in the early stages of treatment. Immune-related RECIST (irRECIST) utilizes RECISTv1.1 
but considers an inflammatory response (or “pseudo-progression”) as normal. The main 
difference between RECISTv1.1 and irRECIST is  that patients can stay on trial after the 
first progressive disease (PD) assessment (as per RECISTv1.1) if using immune-related RECIST criteria. This PD per RECISTv1.1 is then re-labeled as immune related stable 
disease (irSD) per irRECIST and requires additi on of unidimensional measurements of all 
new lesions (that meet the definition of target lesion) to be added to the sum of longest 
diameters (SLD) calculation for response assessment. Importantly, immune-related 
progression (irPD) must be confirmed by a follow-up scan at least 4 weeks (within 4-8 
weeks) following the initial PD/irS D assessment in order to take the patient off the trial.  
 
Subjects that are deemed to have clinical progression and unstable should not be 
continued on therapy after PD (per RECIST v1.1) and are therefore not required to have 
repeat tumor imaging for confirmation as per ir PD definition. It is at the discretion of the 
site investigator whether to continue a su bject on study treatment until repeat imaging is 
obtained. This clinical judgment decision by the site investigator should be based on the 
subject’s overall clinical condition, includi ng performance status, clinical symptoms, and 
laboratory data. 
 
7.1.1 Definitions 
Evaluable for toxicity. All patients will be ev aluable for toxicity from the time of 
their first treatment with study drug. 
 Evaluable for primary endpoint, PFS at 6 m onths.  All patients that receive at 
least one dose of study therapy will be considered evaluable.  Patients enrolled 
and/or randomized to therapy but that never receive study therapy will be replaced. 
 
Evaluable for objective response. All enro lled patients who received at least 1 
cycle(s) of therapy, and had their disease re-evaluated will be considered evaluable for response. These patients will have their response classified 
according to the definitions stated below. (Note: Patients who exhibit objective 
disease progression prior to the end of cycle 1 will also be considered evaluable.) 
7.1.2 Disease Parameters 
Measurable disease. Measurable lesions are defined as those that can be 
accurately measured in at least one dim ension (longest diameter in the plane of 
measurement is to be recorded) with a minimum size of: 
 
 10 mm by CT scan (irrespective of sca nner type) for studies with a slice 
thickness of <5mm or twice the slice thickness or MRI 
 10 mm caliper measurement by clinical exam (lesions which cannot be 
accurately measured with calipers should be recorded as non-
measurable)          
 20 mm by chest X-ray (if clearly defined and surrounded by aerated lung) 
                           
All tumor measurements must be recorded in millimeters (or decimal fractions of   centimeters). 
 
Protocol UMCC 2017.026 
________________________________________________________________________ 
Page 26 of 64 
 Malignant lymph nodes: To be considered pathologically enlarged and 
measurable, a lymph node must be ≥15mm in short axis when assessed by CT 
scan (CT scan slice thickness recommended to be no greater than 5 mm). At 
baseline and in follow-up, only the shor t axis will be measured and followed. 
 Note: Tumor lesions that are situated in a previously irradiated area will only be 
considered measurable, if they have had subsequent progression by at least 5 
mm.  
 Non-measurable disease. All other lesions (or sites of disease), including small 
lesions (longest diameter <10 mm using CT scan), are considered non-measurable disease. Bone lesions without measurable soft tissue component, 
leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial effusions, lymphangitis 
cutis/pulmonitis, inflammatory breast disease, abdominal masses (not followed 
by CT or MRI), and cystic lesions are all non-measurable. 
 
Target lesions. All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ 
and 5 lesions in total should be identified as target lesions  and recorded and 
measured at baseline. Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their 
size (non-nodal lesions with the longest  diameter), be representative of all 
involved organ(s), but in addition should be those that lend themselves to 
reproducible repeated measurements. If a non-nodal lesion is either not present 
or is initially measured with longest di ameter <10mm as a non-target then grows 
to >10mm after baseline, this lesion then becomes a new target lesion as per 
irRECIST criteria. The non-nodal longest diameter is then added to the sum of diameters, and patient response is calculated with the new lesion.  
 
Lymph nodes merit special mention since t hey are normal anatomical structures 
that may be visible by imaging even if not involved by tumor. Pathological nodes 
that are defined as measurable and may be identified as target lesions must 
meet the criterion of a short axis of ≥15mm by CT scan. Only the short axis of 
these nodes will contribute to  the baseline sum. The shor t axis of the node is the 
diameter normally used by radiologists to judge if a node is involved by solid 
tumor. Nodal size is normally reported as two dimensions in the plane in which the image is obtained (for CT scan this is almost always the axial plane; for MRI 
the plane of acquisition may be axial, sagittal or coronal). The smaller of these 
measures is the short axis. For example, an abdominal node which is reported as being 20 mm x 30 mm has a short axis of 20mm and qualifies as a malignant, 
measurable node. In this example, 20mm should be recorded as the nodal 
measurement. All other pathological nodes (those with short axis ≥10mm but <15 
mm) should be considered non-target le sions. Nodes that have a short axis 
<10mm are considered non-pathological and should not be recorded or followed. A sum of the diameters (longest for non-nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) for all target lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum 
of diameters. If lymph nodes are to be in cluded in the sum, then as noted above, 
only the short axis is added into the su m. The baseline sum of diameters will be 
used as reference to further characterize any objective tumor regression in the 
measurable dimension of the disease. If a non-target lymph node grows to 
>15mm after baseline, this node then becomes a new target lesion as per 
irRECIST. The nodal short axis is then added to the sum of diameters, and 
patient response is calculated with the new lesion.  
 
Non-target lesions. All other lesions (or sites of disease) including pathological 
lymph nodes should be identified as non-target lesions and should also be 
recorded at baseline. Measurements are not required, and these lesions should 
be followed as ‘present’, ‘absent’, or in rare cases ‘unequivocal progression’ 
Protocol UMCC 2017.026 
________________________________________________________________________ 
Page 27 of 64 
 (more details to follow). In addition, it is possible to record multiple non-target 
lesions involving the same organ as a single item on the case record form (e.g. 
‘multiple enlarged pelvic lymph nodes’ or ‘multiple liver metastases’). 
7.1.3 Guidelines for Evaluation of Measurable Disease 
All measurements should be recorded in metric notation, using calipers if clinically assessed. All baseline evaluat ions should be performed as close as 
possible to the treatment start date and never more than 4 weeks before the 
beginning of the treatment.  The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to 
characterize each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during 
subsequent follow-up studies. Imaging-based evaluation should always be done 
rather than clinical examination unless the lesion(s) being followed cannot be 
imaged but are assessable by clinical exam.  
Clinical lesions: Clinical lesions w ill only be considered measurable when they 
are superficial and >10mm diameter as assessed using calipers (e.g. skin 
nodules). For the case of skin lesions,  documentation by color photography 
including a ruler to estimate the size of  the lesion is suggested. As noted above, 
when lesions can be evaluated by both clinical exam and imaging, imaging 
evaluation should be undertaken since it is more objective and may also be 
reviewed at the end of the study. 
  
CT, MRI: CT is the best currently available and reproducible method to measure 
lesions selected for response assessment. This guideline has defined measurability of lesions on CT scan ba sed on the assumption that CT slice 
thickness is 5mm or less. When CT scans have slice thickness greater than 5 mm, the minimum size for a measurabl e lesion should be twice the slice 
thickness. MRI is also acceptable in certain situations (e.g. for body scans). 
 
Ultrasound: Ultrasound is not useful in assessment of lesion size and should not 
be used as a method of measurement. Ultrasound examinations cannot be 
reproduced in their entirety for independent review at a later date and, because they are operator dependent, it cannot be guaranteed that the same technique 
and measurements will be taken from one assessment to the next. If new lesions are identified by ultrasound in the course  of the study, confirmation by CT or MRI 
is advised. If there is concern about radi ation exposure at CT, MRI may be used 
instead of CT in selected instances.  Endoscopy, laparoscopy: The utilization of these techniques for objective tumor 
evaluation is not advised. However, they can be useful to confirm complete pathological response when biopsies are obtained or to determine relapse in trials where recurrence following complete response or surgical resection is an 
endpoint. 
 Tumor markers: Tumor markers alone cannot be used to assess objective tumor 
response.

 7.1.4 Response Criteria 
7.1.4.1 Evaluation of Target Lesions 
Prior to the first PD assessment, patients will be evaluated according the 
following RECISTv1.1 response: 
Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions, 
determined by two separate observations conducted not less than 4 
weeks apart. There can be no appearance of new lesions. 
 
Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the 
longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline 
sum LD. There can be no appearance of new lesions. 
 
Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD 
of target lesions (with a minimum absolute increase of 5 mm), taking as 
reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started, or 
the appearance of one or more new lesions. 
 
Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient  shrinkage to qualify for PR (taking 
as reference the baseline sum LD) nor sufficient increase to qualify for 
PD (taking as reference the smallest sum LD since the treatment started). 
 
After the first PD assessment per RECISTv1.1 (=irSD per irRECIST), 
patients will be evaluated for irPD at least 4 weeks apart according to the 
following definition: 
 Immune-related Progressive Disease (irPD): At least a 20% increase in 
the sum of the LD of target lesions (with a minimum absolute increase of 5 mm), taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started, or appearance  of new lesions since the last 
evaluation. 
7.1.4.2 Evaluation of Non-Target Lesions 
Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all non-target lesions. All 
lymph nodes should be non-pathological in size (<10 mm short axis)  
Non-CR/Non-PD: Persistence of one or more non-target lesion(s) 
 
Progressive Disease (PD): Appearance of one or more new lesions 
and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions. 
 Although a clear progression on non-target lesions in absence of stable 
target lesions is exceptional, the opinion of the treating physician should 
prevail in such circumstances .  
7.1.4.3 Evaluation of Best Overall Response 
The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of 
the treatment until disease progressi on/recurrence (taking as reference 
for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the 
treatment started). The patient's best response assignment will depend 
on the achievement of both measur ement and confirmation criteria.

as “symptomatic deterioration” . Every effort should be made to document the objective 
progression even after discontinuation of treatment. 
         NA=not applicable 
 
Note: If subjects respond to treatment and are able to have their disease resected, the patient’s response will be assessed prior to the surgery. 
  
7.1.4.4 Treatment Beyond Progression 
Accumulating evidence indicates a minority of subjects treated with 
immunotherapy may derive clinical benef it despite initial evidence of PD. 
 
Subjects treated on either Arm A or B will be permitted to continue study 
treatment beyond initial RECISTv1.1 defined PD, assessed by the 
investigator, as long as they meet the following criteria: 
 
 Investigator determined clinical benefit 
 Tolerance of study drug 
 Stable performance status 
 Treatment beyond progression will not delay an imminent 
intervention to prevent serious complications of disease progression (e.g., CNS metastases) 
 A radiographic assessment/ scan should be performed within 4-8 weeks 
of initial investigator-assessed pr ogression to determine whether there 
has been a decrease in the tumor size or continued PD (termed irPD). 
The assessment of clinical benefit  should be balanced by clinical 
judgment as to whether the subject is  clinically deteriorating and unlikely 
to receive any benefit from continued treatment.  
Protocol UMCC 2017.026 
________________________________________________________________________ 
Page 30 of 64 
 If the investigator feels that the s ubject continues to achieve clinical 
benefit by continuing treatment, the subject should remain on the trial 
and continue to receive monitoring according to the Study Calendar (see Table 7). 
 
Immune-related Progressive Disease (irPD): For the subjects who 
continue study therapy beyond prog ression, further progression is 
defined as an additional 10% increase in tumor burden with a minimum 5 mm absolute increase from time of initial PD,
 unequivocal worsening of 
NT lesions, or appearance of new lesi ons since the last evaluation. This 
includes an increase in the sum of diameters of all target lesions and/ or the diameters of new measurable lesions compared to the time of initial 
PD. Study treatment should be discontinued permanently upon 
documentation of further progression (i.e. irPD).  
 
7.1.5 Duration of Response 
Duration of overall response: The duration of overall response is measured from 
the time measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever  is first recorded) 
until the first date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented (taking as reference for progressive  disease the smallest measurements 
recorded since the treatment started).  Duration of stable disease: Stable diseas e is measured from the start of the 
treatment until the criteria for progres sion are met, taking as reference the 
smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started.  
7.1.6 Progression-Free Survival 
Progression-free survival (PFS) is defined as the duration of time from start of 
treatment to time of progression. 
7.2 Safety/Tolerability 
  Analyses will be performed for all patients hav ing received at least one dose of study 
drug. The study will use the CTCAE version 4.0.3 for reporting of non-hematologic adverse events (http://ctep.canc er.gov/reporting/ctc.html).  
  
 
8.0 ADVERSE EVENTS  
 
8.1 Adverse Event Reporting Requirements 
Adverse event (AE) monitoring and reporting is a routine part of every clinical trial and is 
done to ensure the safety of subjects enroll ed in the studies as well as those who will 
enroll in future studies using similar agents. Data on adverse events will be collected from 
the time of the initial study treatment admini stration through 100 days after the last dose 
of study treatment. Any serious adverse event  that occurs more than 100 days after the 
last study treatment and is considered related to the study treatment or intervention must 
also be reported. Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) will continue to be followed until: 
Protocol UMCC 2017.026 
________________________________________________________________________ 
Page 31 of 64 
  Resolution or the symptoms or signs that constitute the serious adverse event 
return to baseline; 
 There is satisfactory explanation othe r than the study treatment for the changes 
observed; or  
 Death. 
The investigator is responsible for the dete ction, documentation,  grading and assignment 
of attribution of events meeting the criteria and definition of an AE or SAE. The definitions 
of AEs and SAEs are given below. It is the responsibility of t he principal investigator to 
ensure that all staff involved in the trial is familiar with the content  of this section. 
Any medical condition or laboratory abnorma lity with an onset date before initial study 
treatment administration is considered to be pre-existing in nature. Any known pre-
existing conditions that are ongoing at time of  study entry should be considered medical 
history. 
All events meeting the criteria and definition of an AE or SAE, as defined in Section 8.3, 
occurring from the initial study treatment administration through 100 days following the 
last dose of the study treatment must be recorded as an adverse event in the patient’s 
source documents and on the CRF regardless of frequency, severity (grade) or assessed relationship to the study treatment or interv ention. However, with regards to laboratory 
and vital sign abnormalities, only those which require protocol treatment to be modified or 
treatment to be rendered should  be reported as AEs or SAEs. 
In addition to new events, any increase in the fr equency or severity (i.e., toxicity grade) of 
a pre-existing condition that occurs after t he patient begins study treatment is also 
considered an adverse event. However, anticipated fluctuations of pre-existing 
conditions, including the disease under study, t hat don’t represent a clinically significant 
exacerbation or worsening, need not be reported as AEs.  
8.2 Definitions 
8.2.1 Adverse Event 
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward m edical occurrence in a patient receiving 
study treatment and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with 
this treatment. An AE can be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an 
abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of an experimental intervention, whether  or not related to the intervention.  
 
 Diagnostic and therapeutic non-invasive and invasive (i.e., surgical) 
procedures will not be r eported as adverse events.  However, the medical 
condition for which the procedure wa s performed must be reported if it 
meets the definition of an adverse event unless it is a pre-existing (prior 
to protocol treatment) condition. 
8.2.2 Serious Adverse Event 
An adverse event is considered “serious” if, in the view of either the investigator 
or sponsor-investigator, it results in any of the following outcomes: 
  
 Death. Note, if death results from (progression of) the disease, the 
disease should be reported as event (SAE) itself.  
 A life-threatening adverse event. An  adverse even is considered ‘life-
threatening’ if, in the view of either the investigator [or sponsor], its 
occurrence places the patient or subject at immediate risk of death. It 
Protocol UMCC 2017.026 
________________________________________________________________________ 
Page 32 of 64 
 does not include an adverse event that, had it occurred in a more severe 
form, might have caused death.  
 Inpatient hospitalization or prolongat ion of existing hospitalization for > 
24 hours. 
 A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability 
to conduct normal life functions. 
 A congenital anomaly/birth defect. 
 An important medical event. Any event that may not result in death, be 
life-threatening, or require hospitalization may be considered serious when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize 
the patient and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this defin ition of “Serious Adverse Event”. 
Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm 
requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home; 
convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization or the 
development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
 
Previously planned (prior to signing the informed consent form) surgeries should 
not be reported as SAEs unless the underlying medical condition has worsened 
during the course of the study. Preplan ned hospitalizations or procedures for 
preexisting conditions that are already recorded in the patient’s medical history at 
the time of study enrollment should not be considered SAEs. Hospitalization or 
prolongation of hospitalization without a precipitating clinical AE (for example, for 
the administration of study therapy or other protocol-required procedure) should 
not be considered SAEs. However, if t he preexisting condition worsened during 
the course of the study, it should be reported as an SAE. 
8.2.3 Potential Drug Induced Liver Injury (DILI) 
Wherever possible, timely confirmati on of initial liver-related laboratory 
abnormalities should occur prior to the r eporting of a potential DILI event. All 
occurrences of potential DILIs, meeting t he defined criteria, must be reported as 
SAEs. 
Potential drug induced liver injury is defined as:  1) AT (ALT or AST) elevation > 3 times upper limit of normal (ULN) 
AND 
2) Total bilirubin > 2 times ULN, without initial findings of cholestasis (elevated 
serum alkaline phosphatase) 
AND 
3) No other immediately apparent possible causes of AT elevation and 
hyperbilirubinemia, including, but not limited to, viral hepatitis, pre-existing chronic or acute liver disease, or the administration of other drug(s) known to 
be hepatotoxic.
 
 
8.2.4 Expected Adverse Events 
An adverse event (AE) is considered “expected” if: 
 For approved and marketed drugs or devices, those adverse events are 
described in the approved Package Insert (Label).  
 For investigational new drugs or devices, those adverse events are 
described in the FDA Investigator’s Brochure.  
Protocol UMCC 2017.026 
________________________________________________________________________ 
Page 33 of 64 
  In clinical research studies, info rmation on expected adverse events is 
also summarized in the protocol and in the consent document.  See 
section 9.1 for the list of expected adverse events related to the drug 
under study. 
8.2.5 Unexpected Adverse Event 
An adverse event (AE) is considered “une xpected” if it is not described in the 
Package Insert, Investigator’s Br ochure, or in the protocol.  
8.3 Adverse Event Characteristics 
8.3.1 CTCAE Term 
(AE description) and grade: The descript ions and grading scales found in the NCI 
Common Terminology Criteria for Advers e Events (CTCAE) vers ion 4.0.3 will be 
utilized for AE reporting. All appropriate treatment areas should have access to a copy of the CTCAE version 4.0.3. A c opy of the CTCAE version 4.0.3 can be 
down loaded from the CTEP web site. (http://ctep.cancer.gov)
 
8.3.2 Attribution of the AE 
The investigator or co-investigator is re sponsible for assignment of attribution. 
RELATED 
Definite – The AE is clearly related  to the study treatment. 
Probable – The AE is likely related to the study treatment. 
Possible – The AE may be related  to the study treatment. 
UNRELATED 
Unlikely – The AE is doubtfully related  to the study treatment. 
Unrelated – The AE is clearly NOT related to the study 
treatment/intervention. 
8.4 Serious Adverse Event Reporting Guidelines  
8.4.1 Reporting procedures for multi-site trials 
All serious adverse events (SAEs) and u nanticipated problems (U Ps), regardless 
of causality to study drug, will be reported to the Principal Investigator and also to 
the Coordinating Center.  All SAEs and UPs must be reported to  the Coordinating 
Center within 24 hours of first awareness of the event.  Events should be reported 
using the Coordinating Center’s SAE form as available in the study database.  A copy of the SAE form as available in the study database should be sent to the 
Coordinating Center via fax at  or via email to 
within 24 hou r
 s of the site’s knowledge of the event.  
 
Follow-up information mu st also be re
ported within 24 hours of receipt of the 
information by the investigator. 
 
All SAEs and UPs will be reported to the IR B per current institutional standards. 
 The Coordinating Center will disseminate information regarding SAEs and UPs to 
the participating sites within 5 days of review  of the information by the Coordinating 
Center’s Principal Investigator (or desig nee in the event of extended absence) only 
in the case that the event(s) is believed to be related (i.e., possibly, probably, or 
definitely) to the study drug. The Coor dinating Center will be responsible for 
reporting of events to the FDA and suppor ters, as appropriate (outlined below). 

Protocol UMCC 2017.026 
________________________________________________________________________ 
Page 34 of 64 
 8.4.2 Reporting procedures to BMS 
All Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) occurri ng from the initial study treatment 
administration through 100 day s following the last dose of  the study treatment will 
be reported by the Coordinating Center  to BMS Worldwide safety.  Any SAEs 
occurring after 100 days following the last  dose of the study treatment that are 
believed to be related to study drug will also be reported to BMS Worldwide 
safety.  
The Coordinating Center will send the initial completed SAE Form within 24 
hours of receipt via email to BMS Worldwide Safety 
).   
If only limited information is initially av ailable or an ongoing SAE changes in its 
intensity or relationship to the study drug, or if new informatio n be
comes 
available, a follow-up report will be gener ated and sent to BMS Worldwide Safety 
within 24 hours of receipt.   
8.4.3 Reporting procedures to FDA 
In this trial, serious, unexpected ad verse events believed to be definitely, 
probably or possibly related to the study  treatment will be reported to the Food 
and Drug Administration via the MedWatch 3500A Form. The Michigan IND/IDE 
Assistance Program (MIAP) (University of  Michigan) will assi st the IND Sponsor 
in reporting SAEs to the FDA that m eet the reporting requirements in 21 CFR 
312.32.  This reporting could include the initial report and follow-up reports when 
appropriate for the event.  
8.5 Routine Reporting 
All other adverse events- such as those that are expected, or are unlikely or definitely not related to the study participation- are to be reported annually as part of regular data 
submission.  
8.6 Reporting of Pregnancy 
Pregnancies that occur during study participat ion or within 5 months of last study dose 
should be reported to the Coordinating Center via e-mail at CTSU-Oncology-
Multisite@med.umich.edu  immediately upon site’s knowledge of the event.  
8.7 Reporting of Unanticipated Problems 
There are types of incidents, experiences and outcomes that occur during the conduct of 
human subjects research that represent unanticipated problems but are not considered adverse events. For example, some unanticipat ed problems involve social or economic 
harm instead of the physical or psychologica l harm associated with adverse events. In 
other cases, unanticipated problems place subjec ts or others at increased risk of harm, 
but no harm occurs.  
Upon becoming aware of any incident, experienc e, or outcome (not related to an adverse 
event) that may represent an unanticipated problem, the investigator should assess 
whether the incident, experience, or outcome represents an unanticipated problem. The incident, experience or outcomes is considered unanticipated if it meets all of the 
following criteria:  
1. Unexpected (in terms of nature, severity, or frequency); 
2. Related or possibly related to participation in the research; and 3. Suggests that the research  places subjects or others at a greater risk of harm 
than was previously kn own or recognized. 

Protocol UMCC 2017.026 
________________________________________________________________________ 
Page 35 of 64 
 If the investigator determines that the incident, experience, or outcome represents an 
unanticipated problem, the investigator must report it to the IRB within 14 calendar days 
of the study team becoming aware of the problem.  
8.8 Safety Report Reconciliation  
The Sponsor will reconcile t he clinical database SAE reports transmitted to BMS Global 
Pharmacovigilance .  Frequency of reconciliation should 
be every 3 months and prior to the database lock or final data summary.  BMS GPV&E 
will email, upon request from the Invest igator, the GPV&E reconciliation report.
  Requests 
for reconciliation should be sent to   The data elements 
listed on the GPV&E reconciliation report will be used for identification purposes.  If the 
Investigator d etermines a report was n o
t transmitted to BMS GPV&E, the report should 
be sent immediately to BMS.   
8.9 Stopping Rules  
The DSMC comprised of the principal invest igator, co-investigators at University of 
Michigan, study statistician, and multi-site  coordinator will be responsible for the 
continuous monitoring of the study for trea tment tolerability and efficacy.  During the 
monthly meetings current study data will be reviewed and the decision to continue, hold, 
or stop accrual to either treatment arm of th is study will be formally considered. There are 
no formal stopping rules for this study.  
 
9.0 DRUG INFORMATION 
9.1 Gemcitabine 
9.1.1 Other Names 
  G e m z a r  
9.1.2 Classification 
Gemcitabine (difluorodeoxycytidine) is a pyrimidine antimetabolite, which is an 
analogue of deoxycytidine. It was initially synthesized as a potential antiviral drug 
but selected for anticancer development  because of its activity in in-vivo and in 
vitro tumors. Gemcitabine is approved for the treatment of patients with BTC and 
will be obtained commercially.  
9.1.3 Mechanism of Action 
Gemcitabine kills cells undergoing DNA sy nthesis and blocks the progression of 
cells through the G1/S-phase boundary. Gemcitabine is metabolized by 
nucleoside kinases to diphosphate (dFdCDP) and triphosphate (dFdCTP) 
nucleosides. Gemcitabine diphosphate inhibits ribonucleotide reductase, an 
enzyme responsible for catalyzing the reactions that generate deoxynucleoside triphosphates for DNA synthesis, resulting in reductions in deoxynucleotide 
concentrations, including dCTP. Gemcitabine triphosphate competes with dCTP 
for incorporation into DNA. The reduction in the intracellular concentration of dCTP by the action of the diphosp hate enhances the incorporation of 
gemcitabine triphosphate into DNA (self- potentiation). After the gemcitabine 
nucleotide is incorporated into DNA, only one additional nucleotide is added to the growing DNA strands, which eventually  results in the initiation of apoptotic 
cell death.

 9.1.4 Pharmacokinetics 
1. Distribution: Gemcitabine plasma protein binding is negligible. The volume of 
distribution is increased with the infu sion length. In a pharmacokinetics study 
of patients with various solid tumors, the volume of distribution of 
gemcitabine was 50 L/m2 following infusions lasting <70 minutes. For long 
infusions (70 to 285 minutes), the volume of distribution rose to 370 L/ m2. 
 
2. Metabolism: Gemcitabine is metabolized intracellularly to form active 
gemcitabine di- and tri-phosphates. The gemcitabine di- and triphosphates do not appear to circulate in plasma in measurable amounts. Gemcitabine is 
metabolized by the liver to form the inactive uracil derivative, 2'-deoxy-2',2'-difluorouridine (dFdU). The inactive metabolite does not appear to 
accumulate with weekly dosing; howeve r, it is excreted by the kidneys and 
may accumulate in patients with decreased renal function. 
 
3. Elimination: Following a single 1,000 mg/m2 /30 min [14C]-gemcitabine 
infusion, 92% to 98% of the dose was recovered within 1 week after 
gemcitabine administration. Urinary excretion of the parent drug and the 
dFdU metabolite accounted for 99% of  the excreted dose, and less than 1% 
of the dose was excreted in feces. The renal clearance of gemcitabine is less 
than 10%; therefore, the parent dr ug appears to be almost completely 
metabolized to the inactive dFdU.  Clearance of gemcitabine is affected by age and gender and is lower in 
women and the elderly. Differences in either clearance or volume of 
distribution based on patient characterist ics or the duration of infusion result 
in changes in half-life and plasma co ncentrations. Studies showed that 
gemcitabine half-life for short infusions ranged from 42 to 94 minutes, for long infusions it varied from 245 to 638 minutes, depending on age and gender, reflecting a greatly increased volume of distribution with longer 
infusions. The terminal phase half-life for the active metabolite, gemcitabine 
triphosphate, in mononuclear cells ranges from 1.7-19.4 hours.

1. Side Effects: Refer to the current FD A-approved package insert for the most 
comprehensive and up to date information on adverse reactions. Adverse 
Protocol UMCC 2017.026 
________________________________________________________________________ 
Page 37 of 64 
 effects reported in >20% to 100% of subjects treated with gemcitabine 
include: flu-like symptoms, nausea, vomiting, rash, alopecia, infection, 
myelosuppression including anemia, leukopenia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia, muscle weakness, hematuria, paresthesia, sensory 
neuropathy, fatigue, somnolence, hearing loss, peripheral edema. Adverse 
effects reported in 4% to 20% of subj ects include: diarrhea, constipation, 
stomatitis, dyspnea, ca pillary leak syndrome, posterior reversible 
encephalopathy syndrome (PRES). Adverse effects reported in 3% or less of subjects include: arrhythmias, supraventricular arrhythmias, congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, desquamation and bullous skin eruptions, 
gangrene, cerebrovascular accident, hepatic failure, adult respiratory distress 
syndrome (ARDS), anaphylaxis, renal failure, pulmonary fibrosis, pulmonary 
edema, and, Interstitial, pneumonitis. Grade 3 and 4 adverse events in 
combination with cisplatin for BTC from the phase trial are as listed in Table 2 of the publication (Valle, Wasan et al. 2010).  
 
2. Pregnancy and Lactation: Category D. Gemcitabine may cause fetal harm 
when administered to a pregnant woman. This agent has produced teratogenic effects in mice and rabbits when administered at a dose of < 2 
mg/m2. Adverse effects included decreased fetal viability, weight and morphologic defects. There is no data on gemcitabine administration during 
human pregnancy, and it is not currently known if metabolites are excreted in 
human milk. However, many drugs are excreted in human milk, and there is 
a potential for adverse effects in nurs ing infants. Therefore, the use of 
gemcitabine should be avoided in pregnant or nursing women because of the potential hazard to the fetus or infant. 
3. Drug Interactions: Per gemcitabine package insert, no formal drug interaction 
studies have been performed to date.  When gemcitabine was administered 
with cisplatin there was minimal or no effect on the pharmacokinetics of the studied drugs. 
9.2 Cisplatin 
9.2.1 Other Names 
CDDP, Platinol, NSC-119875 
9.2.2 Classification 
Cisplatin is an alkylating agent, which inhibits DNA synthesis by producing cross-
linking of parent DNA strands (cell-cy cle phase-nonspecific). Cisplatin is 
approved for the treatment of patients with BTC and will be obtained 
commercially.  
9.2.3 Mechanism of Action 
  Cisplatin (cis-diamminedichloroplatinum) is a heavy metal complex containing a 
central platinum atom surrounded by two chloride atoms and two ammonia 
molecules in the cis position. It is water soluble and acts as a bifunctional 
alkylating agent with cell cycle nonspecific characteristics. The intra-strand cross-links, in particular with guanine and cytosine, change DNA conformation and 
inhibit DNA synthesis leading to the cytotoxic and anti-tumor effects of cisplatin. 
Although cisplatin seems to act as an alkylating agent, there are data to indicate that its mode and sites of action are different from those of nitrogen mustard and 
the standard alkylating agents and that cisp latin does not exhibit cross-resistance 
with other alkylating agents or nitrosoureas. 
Protocol UMCC 2017.026 
________________________________________________________________________ 
Page 38 of 64 
 9.2.4 Pharmacokinetics 
1. Absorption: Following rapid IV injection of cisplatin over up to one hour, peak 
plasma drug and platinum concentrations occur immediately. When cisplatin 
is administered by IV infusion over 6 or 24 hours, plasma concentrations of 
total platinum increase gradually during the infusion and peak immediately 
following the end of the infusion.  
2. Distribution: Following in travenous dosing, cisplatin distributes rapidly into 
tissues, with highest concentrations in the liver, prostate and kidney. Plasma levels of cisplatin decay in a biphasic mode with an initial half-life of 25 to 49 
minutes, and a secondary phase ranging from 58 to 73 hours. This prolonged 
phase is due to protein binding, which exceeds 90%. Cisplatin penetrates 
poorly into the CNS. 
 
3. Metabolism: Cisplatin is non-enzymatically transformed to one or more 
metabolites that are extensively protein bound and have minimal cytotoxic 
activity. The non-protein bound (unchanged) fraction is cytotoxic. 
 
4. Elimination: Urinary excretion is in complete. Following bolus injection or 
infusion over a dose range of 40-140 mg/m2 varying in length from 1-24 hours, from 10 to about 40% of the administered platinum is excreted in the 
urine in 24 hours. Renal clearance of free platinum exceeds the glomerular 
filtration rate, indicating that cisplatin or other platinum containing molecules are actively secreted by the kidneys. Renal clearance of free platinum is 
nonlinear and variable, and is dependent on dose, urine flow rate, and individual variability in the extent of active secretion and possible tubular 
reabsorption. 
9.2.5 Storage, Preparation and Stability 
Refer to the current FDA-approved package insert for storage, stability and 
special handling information. 
9.2.6 Dose and Administration 
  See Section 5.1 
9.2.7 Availability 
Cisplatin is commercially available and w ill not be supplied. Refer to the current 
FDA-approved package insert for the most comprehensive and up to date 
information. 
9.2.8 Handling and Disposal 
Handling and disposal of cisplatin should be per institutional guidelines for the 
handling and disposal of biologic and cy totoxic agents. Recommended safety 
measures for preparation and handling of  gemcitabine include laboratory coats 
and gloves. 
9.2.9 Adverse Effects 
1. Side Effects: Refer to the current FD A-approved package insert for the most 
comprehensive and up to date information on adverse reactions. Adverse 
effects reported in >20% to 100% of subj ects treated with cisplatin include: 
nausea, vomiting, myelosuppression, anemia, leucopenia, thrombocytopenia, 
nephrotoxicity (acute renal failure and chronic renal insufficiency), and ototoxicity. Adverse effects reported in 4% to 20% of subjects include: 
alopecia, dysgeusia, diarrh ea, hypersensitivity reaction, confusion, vestibular 
Protocol UMCC 2017.026

Page 39 of 64 
 dysfunction, peripheral neur opathy, blurred vision or altered color perception. 
Adverse effects reported in 3% or less of subjects include: secondary 
malignancy and seizure. Other published literature suggests risk of thromboembolic events. 
 
2. Pregnancy and Lactation: Category D.  Cisplatin can cause fetal harm when 
administered to a pregnant woman. In mice, cisplatin is teratogenic and embryotoxic. This drug has been found to be excreted in human milk and 
because of the potential for serious ad verse reactions in nursing infants, 
patients receiving cisplatin should not breast feed. 
 
3. Drug Interactions: During cisplatin th erapy, plasma levels of anticonvulsant 
agents (valproic acid, phenytoin, and carbamazepine) may become sub-therapeutic and should be moni tored. Concomitant use with 
aminoglycosides, tacrolimus, and amphotericin B increase risk of 
nephrotoxicity. Concomitant use with loop diuretics and aminoglycosides 
increase risk of ototoxicit y. Concurrent use with lithium may result in reduced 
lithium plasma concentration. Concurrent use with warfarin may result in 
increased INR. Concurrent use with th ioctic acid may result in decreased 
cisplatin effectiveness and should be avoided.

Note: BMS-936558 (Nivolumab, MDX-1106) in combination with other agents could cause an exacerbation of any adverse event currently known to be 
caused by the other agent, or the combination may result in events never previously associated with either agen t. Adverse events occurring in < 1%, 
post marketing, and/or case reports:  Hemophagocyticlymphohistiocytosis, 
rhabdomyolysis and polymyositis have been reported in patients received more than one dose of combination therapy (nivolumab 3 mg/kg and 
ipilimumab 1 mg/kg every 3 weeks) for t he treatment of metastatic gastric 
adenocarcinoma and advanced bladder cancer, respectively. 
 
2. Pregnancy and Lactation: Pregnancy: Adverse events were observed in 
animal reproduction studies. Nivolu mab may be expected to cross the 
placenta; effects to the fetus may be greater in the second and third 
trimesters. Based on its mechanism of action, nivolumab is expected to cause fetal harm if used during pre gnancy. Women of reproductive potential 
should use highly-effective contracept ion during therapy and for at least 5 
months after treatment has been discontinued. Men receiving nivolumab and who are sexually active with women of child bearing potential should adhere to contraception for a period of 7 mont hs after the last dose of nivolumab. 
 Lactation: It is not known if nivolumab is excreted into breast milk. Due to the 
potential for serious adverse reactions in the nursing infant, the manufacturer 
recommends women to discontinue breastfeeding during treatment with 
nivolumab. 
 
3. Drug Interactions: Nivolumab is not expected to have any effect on 
cytochrome P450 or other drug metaboliz ing enzymes in terms of inhibition 
or induction, and is, therefore, not expected to induce these types of PK-
based drug interactions. No incompatib ilities between nivolumab injection 
and polyvinyl chloride (PVC), non-PVC/non- DEHP (di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate) 
IV components, or glass bottles have been observed. 
9.4 Ipilimumab 
9.4.1 Other Names 
(BMS-734016, MDX-010, YERVOY®) (NSC 732442) (IND-119672) 
9.4.2 Classification  
Immunomodulatory; checkpoint inhibitor 
9.4.3 Mechanism of Action 
Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 CTLA-4 is a negative regulator of T-cell 
activity. Ipilimumab is a full human monoclonal immunoglobin (lg) antibody that 
binds to CTLA-4 and blocks the interaction of CTLA-4 with its ligands, 
Protocol UMCC 2017.026 
________________________________________________________________________ 
Page 43 of 64 
 CD80/CD86. Blockade of CTLA-4 has been shown to augment T-cell activation 
and proliferation, including the activation  and proliferation of tumor infiltrating T-
effector cells. Inhibition of CTLA-4 signaling can also reduce T-regulatory cell 
function, which may contribute to a gene ral increase in T cell responsiveness, 
including the anti-tumor immune response. 
9.4.4 Pharmacokinetics 
1. Absorption: No formal pharmacokinetic drug interaction studies have been 
conducted with ipilimumab. Ipilimumab is not expected to have 
pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions, since it is not metabolized by CYP450 or other drug metabolizing enzymes. 
2. Distribution: Ipilimumab is confined ma inly to the extracellular fluid. Peak 
concentration (Cmax), trough concentration (Cmin), and area under the 
plasma concentration versus time curv e (AUC) of ipilimumab increased dose 
proportionally within the dose range examined ipilimumab is confined mainly 
to the extracellular fluid. Peak concentration (Cmax), trough concentration 
(Cmin), and area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC) of 
ipilimumab increased dose proportionally  within the dose range examined. 
Based on population pharmacokinetic analysis, the mean volume of 
distribution (% coefficient of variation)  at steady state was 7.47 liters (10%). 
3. Metabolism: Not applicable. Monoclonal antibodies are usually degraded into 
amino acids and small peptides, independently from CYP450 or other drug-metabolizing enzymes. 
4. Elimination: Clearance increased with body weight, but no dose adjustment 
is required with dosing on a mg/kg basis. Upon repeated dosing every 3 weeks, the clearance (CL) of ipilimumab was found to be time-invariant, and 
systemic accumulation was 1.5-fold or less. The mean value (% coefficient of variation) generated through population pharmacokinetic analysis for the 
terminal half-life (t1/2) was 15.4 days (34%) and for CL was 16.8 mL/h 
(38%).  
9.4.5 Storage, Preparation and Stability 
Ipilimumab injection is supplied as 200 mg/40 mL (5 mg/mL). It is formulated as a 
clear to slightly opalescent, colorless to pale yellow, sterile, non-pyrogenic, 
single-use, isotonic aqueous solution that may contain particles. Each vial is a 
Type I flint glass vial with gray butyl stoppers and sealed with aluminum seals. 
 
1. Store intact vials of ipilimumab refrig erated at (2 to 8 °C), protected from

combination protocol using multiple investigational agents and has an AE listed on different SPEERs, use the lo wer of the grades to determine if 
expedited reporting is required. 
 
Please refer to the Investigator Brochure Addendum for the 
Comprehensive Adverse Events and Potential Risks (CAEPR) List. 
 
2. Pregnancy and Lactation: There are no adequate and well controlled studies 
of Ipilimumab in pregnant women. Use of Ipilimumab during pregnancy only if 
the potential benefit justifie s the potential risk to the fetus. Human IgG1 is 
known to cross the placental barrier and ipilimumab is an IgG1; therefore, 
ipilimumab has the potential to be transmitted from the mother to the developing fetus. It is not known wh ether ipilimumab is secreted in human 
milk. Because many drugs are secreted in human milk and because of the 
potential for serious adverse  reactions in nursing infants from ipilimumab, a 
decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue 
ipilimumab, taking into account the importance of ipilimumab to the mother. 
 
3. Drug Interactions: No formal pharma cokinetic drug interaction studies have 
been conducted with ipilimumab. Ipilimumab is not expected to have pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions, since it is not metabolized by 
CYP450 or other drug metabolizing enzymes

 10.0 CORRELATIVES/TRANSLATIONAL STUDIES 
We will study the BTC tumor microenvironment thro ugh the use of pre-treat ment tissue collection 
(at all sites) as well as on-treatment (for patient s at University of Mich igan) and post-treatment 
(optional for patients enrolled at all sites) tumo r biopsies. Identification of important biologic 
subsets of BTC patients that may have clinical e fficacy from nivolumab and ipilimumab will be the 
overarching goal of this translational scienc e. Tumor from core biopsies will be examined 
histologically by immunohistochemistry (IHC), immunofluorescence (IF), and RNA analysis. Post-
treatment biopsy tissue will be separated into sections for paraffin embedding, fresh frozen in 
OTC, and fresh frozen in RNAlater. Whole genomic DNA will be evaluated for mutational 
analysis). Biologic readouts for PD-1 and CTLA4 response biomarkers will be assessed along 
with specific markers of tumor infiltrating l eukocytes (TILs). TILs and their subsets will be 
assessed using markers by IHC (e.g. CD4, CD8, FoxP3 (Treg), CD14 or CD68 (TAMs), CD11c 
(DCs)).  Response biomarkers w ill be determined by IHC or IF (e .g. B7-H1 (PD-1L), CD80, CD86, 
B7-H4, B7-HDC (PD-L2), CTLA4, CD28, LAG3, Ti m-3, CD40, OX40) (Wu, Kryczek et al. 2009, 
Lou, Diao et al. 2016).  Cytokine signaling representative of Th1, Th2, and other immune pathway signature gene expression will be determined by  transcriptomic assessment (RNAseq) and 
analyzed using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis so ftware (GSEA) (Subramanian, Tamayo et al. 
2005, Eichler 2012) at the University  of Michigan.  Furthermore, we will study peripheral blood for 
the presence of peripheral blood mononuclear cell subsets following Ficoll separation and 
multiplex FACS analysis for T cell subset marker s and co-stimulatory/inhibitory markers (Wu, 
Kryczek et al. 2009). Biologic markers and RNA expression will be exami ned in the context of 
patient efficacy.  
10.1 Tissue Collection 
Tissue will be collected at the time points specified in section 6. 2 Study Calendar. A 
FFPE block or 10 unstained and 1 H&E slide should be submitted as per the lab manual. 
Please refer to the lab manual for additional sample collection and processing details.   
A CLIA certified targeted gene panel will be run on the post-treatment tissue without 
additional cost to the patient, and the report will be released to the treating investigator to inform future therapy options. 
10.2 Blood Collection 
Blood samples will be collected at the time points specified in section 6.2 Study Calendar. 
Please refer to the lab manual for sample collection and processing details.  
10.3 Centralized Imaging 
All baseline and response imaging studies will be de-identified and shipped to the University of Michigan for banking and explor atory endpoint assessment. Please see the 
lab manual for data format and shipping details. 
10.4 Specimen Banking 
Patient samples collected for this study will be retained at University of Michigan.

withdrawn by the patient, best efforts will  be made to stop any additional studies and to 
destroy the specimens. 
 Specimens being stored long-term for potent ial use not outlined in the protocol are 
subject to University Policy Governing Tiss ue Sample Collection, Ownership, Usage, and 
Disposition within all UMMS Research Repositories. 
 
11.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
Protocol UMCC 2017.026 
________________________________________________________________________ 
Page 46 of 64 
 11.1 Study Design/Study Endpoints 
This protocol will randomize patients with advanced unresectable BTC equally (1:1) to 
one of two novel treatment regimens. The randomization will be stratified for locally 
advanced versus metastatic cancers. The prim ary endpoint is PFS at 6 months following 
the initiation of treatment. Comparisons will be limited between each novel treatment 
regimen and the historical control value a nd not directly between treatments. Secondary 
endpoints include the calculati on of the overall response rate, median PFS, overall 
survival, and the incidence of adverse event s for each treatment regimen separately.  
11.2 Sample Size and Accrual 
The trial is sized to compare each randomized treatment arm to a historical value for PFS 
in this patient population receiving standard treatment. The PFS proportion in this patient population at 6 months is 59% (Valle, Wasan et al. 2010). Using this value as the null 
hypothesis, we hope to see an increase in the proportion of alive, progression-free 
patients to 80% or above in each of the comb ination arms. Thirty-two patients evaluable 
for the 6-month PFS endpoint are required to test this hypothesis with >80% power and at most 5% type I error (1-sided).  A ma ximum of 64 evaluable patients (per Section 
7.1.1) will be enrolled. 
11.3 Data Analyses Plans 
PFS will be estimated using the product-limit method of Kaplan and Meier. Follow-up time 
will be defined as time from date of first study  treatment until the date of radiological or 
clinical progression (leading to withdrawal fr om the study), or death from any cause, 
whichever comes first.  Follow-up time will be censored at the date of last disease 
evaluation.  Estimates for the median and 75
th percentiles with 95% confidence intervals 
will be reported.  OS will be similarly estimated and summarized with follow-up time 
calculated from the date of first study treatment until date of death or censoring.  Other 
safety data (e.g., laboratory safety parameters,  vital signs, concomitant medications and 
new physical examination findings) will be su mmarized descriptively by reporting counts 
and percentages, with exact binomial confiden ce intervals where appropriate. ORR will 
be determined as per the RECISTv1.1 guidelines.  Ad verse events will be reported per 
the NCI CTCAE v4.03.  There are no formal stopping rules for this study. 
 
 
12.0 ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES 
12.1 Ethics and Good Clinical Practice 
This study must be carried out in complianc e with the protocol and be consistent with 
Good Clinical Practice (GCP), as defined  by the International Conference on 
Harmonization (ICH), WHO and any local directives. 
 
The protocol, any amendments, and the subject informed consent will receive Institutional 
Review Board/Independent Ethics Committ ee (IRB/IEC) approval/favorable opinion 
before initiation of the study.  
12.2 Data Management 
All information will be recorded locally and ent ered into Case Report Forms (CRFs) on 
the web-based electronic data capture (EDC) system of the University of Michigan. 
Online access will be provided to each site by the Coordinating Center.   CRFs will be reviewed and source verified by the MSC during annual monitoring visits 
and prior to and between visits. Discrepant, unusual and incomplete data will be queried 
by the MSC. The investigator or study c oordinator will be responsible for providing 
Protocol UMCC 2017.026 
________________________________________________________________________ 
Page 47 of 64 
 resolutions to the data queries, as appropriate . The investigator must ensure that all data 
queries are dealt with promptly.  
 
The data submission schedule is as follows:  
 At the time of registration   
o Subject entry into the EDC 
 Subject Status 
 Demographics 
 During study participation 
o All data should be entered online within 10 business days of data acquisition. 
[Information on dose limiting toxicity events must be entered within one 
business day.]  Information on Serious Adverse Events must be entered 
within the reporting timeframe specifi ed in Section 8.5 of the protocol.  
  
All study information should be recorded in an appropriate source document (e.g. clinic 
chart). 
12.3 Record Retention 
The Investigators must retain all study records and source documents for the maximum period required by applicable regulations and guidelines, or institution procedures, 
whichever is longer. 
 
13.0 DATA AND SAFETY MONITORING 
The Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) of The University of Michigan 
Comprehensive Cancer Center (UMCCC) is the DSMC for this study.  This committee is responsible for monitoring the safety  and data integrity of the trial. 
 At each site the study team is required to meet quarterly to discuss matters related to: 
 
 Enrollment rate relative to expectati ons, characteristics of participants 
 Safety of study participants (Serious Adverse Event & Adverse Event reporting) 
 Adherence to protocol (protocol deviations) 
 Completeness, validity and integrity of study data 
 Retention of study participants 
 
These meetings are to be documented by the site data manager or study coordinator using the Protocol Specific Data and Safety Monitoring Report (DSMR), signed by the site principal 
investigator or co-investigator.  Each site is required to submit the completed DSMR to the Multi-
Site Coordinator at the University of Michigan Coordinating Center on a quarterly basis together 
with other pertinent documents. 
 
Similarly, protocol deviations are to be docume nted using the Notice of Protocol Deviation Form 
and requires the signatures of bot h the sites data manager or study coordinator and the site 
principal investigator or co-investigator. These repor ts are to be sent to the University of Michigan 
Coordinating Center within 7 calendar days of  awareness of the event and on a quarterly basis 
with the Protocol Specific Data and Safety Monitoring Report. 
 
The Coordinating Center is responsible for collat ing all the Data and Safety Monitoring Reports 
from all the participating sites, and providing the information to the Data Safety Monitoring 
Committee. 
14.0 QUALITY ASSURANCE AND AUDITS 
The Data and Safety Monitoring Committee can request a ‘for cause’ quality assurance audit of the trial if the committee identifies a need for a more rigorous evaluation of study-related issues.  
Protocol UMCC 2017.026 
________________________________________________________________________ 
Page 48 of 64 
  
A regulatory authority (e.g. FDA) may also wish to conduct an inspection of the study, during its 
conduct or even after its completion. If an in spection has been requested by a regulatory 
authority, the site investigator must immediately inform the Coordinating Center that such a request has been made. 
15.0 CLINICAL MONITORING PROCEDURES 
Clinical studies coordinated by The Universi ty of Michigan Comprehensive Cancer Center 
(UMCCC) must be conducted in accordance with the ethical principles that are consistent with 
Good Clinical Practices (GCP) and in compliance with other applicable regulatory requirements. 
 
This study will be monitored by a representativ e of the Coordinating Center of the UMCCC. 
Monitoring visits will be made during the cond uct of the study and at study close-out. 
 
Prior to subject recruitment, a participating site w ill undergo site initiation meeting to be conducted 
by the Coordinating Center. Th is will be done as an actual site visit; teleconference, 
videoconference, or web-based meeting after t he site has been given access to the study 
database and assembled a study reference binder.  The site’s principal investigator and his study staff should make every effort in attending the site initiation meeting. Study–related questions or 
issues identified during the site initiation meeting will be followed-up by the appropriate UMCCC 
personnel until they have been answered and resolved.  
Monitoring of this study will include both ‘Centra lized Monitoring’, the review of source documents 
at the Coordinating Center and ‘On- site Monitoring’, an actual site visit.  The first ‘Centralized’ 
visit should occur after the first subject enrolled completes [first treatment cycle/course].  The study site will send the de-identified source documents to the Coordinating Center for monitoring.  
‘Centralized’ monitoring may be requested by the Coordinating Center if an amendment requires changes to the protocol procedures. The site will send in pertinent de-identified source 
documents, as defined by the Coor dinating Center for monitoring.  
 
The first annual ‘On-site’ monitoring visit should  occur after the first five study participants are 
enrolled or twelve months after a study opens, whichever occurs first.  The annual visit may be 
conducted as a ‘Centralized’ visit if less than thr ee subjects have enrolled at the study site.  The 
type of visit is at the discretion of the Coordina ting Center.  At a minimum, a routine monitoring 
visit will be done at least once a year, or once during  the course of the study  if the study duration 
is less than 12 months. The purpose of these visits is to verify: 
 
 Adherence to the protocol 
 Completeness and accuracy of study data and samples collected 
 Proper storage, dispensing and inventory of study medication 
 Compliance with regulations 
 
During a monitoring visit to a site, access to relevant hospital and clinical records must be given 
by the site investigator to the Coordinating C enter representative conducting the monitoring visit 
to verify consistency of data collected on the CRFs  with the original source data.  While most 
patient cases will be selected from patients accr ued since the previous monitoring visit, any 
patient case has the potential for review.  At least one or more unannounced cases will be reviewed, if the total accruals warr ant selection of unannounced cases.  
 The Coordinating Center expects the relevant invest igational staff to be available to facilitate the 
conduct of the visit, that source documents are available at the time of the visit, and that a 
suitable environment will be provided for review of  study-related documents.  Any issues identified 
during these visits will be communicated to the site and are expected to be resolved by the site in 
a timely manner.  For review of study-related docu ments at the Coordinating Center, the site will 
be required to ship or fax documents to be reviewed.

 Participating site will also undergo a site close-out  upon completion, termination or cancellation of 
a study to ensure fulfillment of study obligations during the conduct of the study, and that the site 
Investigator is aware of his/her ongoing responsi bilities. In general, a site close-out is conducted 
during a site visit; however, site close-out can occur without a site visit.

These general guidelines constitute guidance to the Investigator and may be supplemented by discussions with the Medical Monitor representin g the Sponsor. The guidance applies to all immuno-
oncology agents and regimens.  Corticosteroids are a primary therapy for immuno -oncology drug-related adv erse events. The oral 
equivalent of the recommended IV doses may be co nsidered for ambulatory patients with low-grade 
toxicity. The lower bioavailability of oral corticoste roids should be taken into account when switching to 
the equivalent dose of oral corticosteroids.

Name of Sponsor/Company:   Impax Laboratories, Inc. acting through its Impax Specialty 
Pharma division (Impax)  
Name of Investigational Product:   IPX203 (carbidopa -levodopa) Extended -Release Capsules  
Name of Active Ingredient:   carbidopa (CD), levodopa (LD)  
Protocol Title :  A Randomized, Multiple Dose Study to Assess the Pharmacokinetics and 
Pharmacodynamics of IPX203 in Subject s with Advanced Parkinson’s Disease  
Protocol No.:   IPX20 3-B16-01 
Study center(s):   Multicenter  
Phase of Development:   Phase 2  
Study  Duration :  Approximately 8 weeks including Screening  
Objectives:  
Primary:   To compare the pharmacokinetics (PK) of single and multiple doses of IPX203 
with immediate release ( IR) CD-LD in subject s with advanced Parkinson’s disease  (PD) . 
Secondary:  
 To compare the pharmacodynamics of single and multiple doses of IPX203 with 
IR CD-LD 
 To compare the efficacy of IPX203 with IR  CD-LD following multiple doses  
 To evaluate  the safety of IPX203 . 
Methodology:  This is a randomized, open -label, rater -blinded, multicenter,  2-treatment, 
2-period, multiple -dose crossover  study.   Approximately 30 advanced PD subjects will be 
randomized to 1  of 2 dosing  sequences.   The study duration will be approximately 8 weeks, 
including the screening period.  
This study will consist of 4 study  visits  after Screening :  Day 1 of each treatment per iod 
(Visits 1 and 3), and Day 15 of each treatment period (Visits 2 and 4) .  Study Exit  procedures  
will be  done at the end of Visit 4 or within 3 days of Visit 4 or during an early withdrawal.   
Subjects may continue to take allowed non -CD-LD based PD medic ations throughout the 
study if documented in their prestudy regimen and if dosing regimens have been stable for at 
least 4  weeks prior to Visit 1.   During the 1 -week (±  2 days) washout period between treatment 
periods, subjects will return to their prestudy PD medication regimen.  
Within 2 weeks following Screening, eligible subjects will complete their PD  and Dosing 
diaries, and will wear the Kinesia  360 sensor band s on the mo re affected side at home 
immediately after waking  on each of the 3 days  prior to Visit  1.  Subjects will be instructed to 
take their last dose of CD -LD no later than 10:00 PM on the even ing prior to Visits 1 and 3.  
The first morning dose of study medication will be administered at the study site.  The “first 
morning dose” is def ined as the subject’s first LD dose upon awakening for the day 
immediately following the subject’s usual nocturnal sleep period intended to achieve an “on” 
Protocol No. IPX203 -B16-01 CONFIDENTIAL  
Amendment 2: October 5 , 2016  Impax Laboratories, Inc.  
Page 6 of 136 state.  On Day 1 of  the IR  CD-LD treatment period, subjects will start with a single dose of 
their usual prestudy first morning IR  CD-LD dose.  On Day 1 of the  IPX203 treatment period, 
subjects will start with  a single dose of IPX203 based on their usual prestu dy first morning 
IR CD-LD dose.   Pharmacokinet ic and pharmacodynamic measures will be assessed in the 
clinic for up to 8  hours postdose during Visits 1 and 3.  If subject experiences an “off” state for 
≥ 3 consecutive hours after dosing, the subject may receive rescue medication, (by taking an 
additio nal dose of study medication  for that period ).  PK blood sampling  and 
pharmacodynamic assessments will be continued throughout the 8 -hour PK/pharmacodynamic 
study period including in those subjects who receive rescue medication.  
Day 1 (Visits 1 and 3) bloo d samples  (6 mL) for PK analysis will be collected predose and at 
0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 5, 5.5, 6, 6.5, 7, 7.5, and 8 hours postdose.  
The following pharmacodynamic measures will be conducted during Visits 1 and 3 by 
qualified clinical staff who are bl inded to dosing:  
 Assessment of Subject’s Motor State (“on” and “off,” and state of dyskinesia) at –1, –0.5, 
0, and at half -hourly intervals postdose for up to 8 hours.  
 MDS -UPDRS Part III (Motor Examination) at predose and hourly for up to 8 hours 
postdose.  
Following the completion of Visits 1 and 3, subjects will be discharged from the clinic and 
instructed to take the ir assigned study drug at home for the remainder of Day 1 through 
Day 14 of each treatment period  and return to the clinic on Day  15 (of each treatment period) 
for Visits  2 and 4 . 
During the IR  CD-LD treatment period, the initial  dosing regimen of IR  CD-LD will be the 
same as the  subject’s stable prestudy regimen unless they were taking a single daily bedtime 
dose of CR CD-LD, either  alone or  in combination with IR CD-LD, in which case, the 
CR CD-LD dose  will be discontinued and substituted with a 1:1 milligram -equivalent  
IR CD-LD dose.  A “bedtime dose” is defined as a dose of CR  CD-LD taken within 1 hour of 
the subject’s normal night time sleep period.  During the IPX203 treatment period, the in itial 
doses of IPX203 will be based on the subject’s prestudy stable LD regimen and the initial 
response to IPX203.  The typical dosing regimen for IPX203 will be three times a day, dosed 
approximately every 7  to 8 hours.  Som e subjects may require more or less frequent dosing to 
optimize therapeutic effect (minimize “off” time without causing troublesome dyskinesia or 
other dopaminergic side effects).  
During Days 1 through 9  of both treatme nt periods , investigators may adjust each subject’s 
study medication regimen if necessary to optimize  efficacy and safety .  Site staff should 
follow -up on the subject’s status (dosing, response and adverse events) every 1 -3 days by 
telephone . 
On Days 10 through 1 4 of each treatment period, subjects should  be on a stable dosing 
regimen.  Subjects may continue to take permitte d non-CD-LD based PD medications 
throughout the study if documented in their prestudy regimen and if dosing regimens have 
been stable  for at least 4 weeks prior to Visit 1.   Subjects will complete their Dosing and PD 
Diaries  and wear the Kinesia  360 sensor bands  on the more affected side at home immediately 
after waking in the morning  on each of the 3 days prior to Visits 2 and 4 (Days 12-14 of each 
treatment period ). 
For the Day 15 clinic visits, the  subjects  will be instructed to withh old their study medication 
Protocol No. IPX203 -B16-01 CONFIDENTIAL  
Amendment 2: October 5 , 2016  Impax Laboratories, Inc.  
Page 7 of 136 for at least 5 hours before arriving at the study site.  The first morning dose of study 
medication will be administered at th e study site.  This first morning dose and subsequent 
doses administered  in the clinic will be the same as the dosing regimen recorded in the dosing 
diary  for Day s 12-14 of the current treatment period.  
Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic measures will the n be assessed in the clinic for up to 
10 hours postdose during Visits 2 and 4 .  PK blood sampling  and pharmacodynamic 
assessments will be continued throughout the 10 -hour PK/pharmacodynamic study period.  
Day 15 (Visits 2 and 4) blood  samples (6  mL) for PK analysis will be collected predose and at 
0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 10 hours postdose.  
The following pharmacodynamic measures will be conducted during Visits 2 and 4 by 
qualified clinical staff who are blinded to dosing:  
 Assessme nt of Subject’s Motor State (“on” and “off,” and state of dyskinesia) at –1, –0.5, 
0, and half -hourly intervals postdose for up to 10 hours.  
 MDS -UPDRS Part s I, II, and IV will be assessed at predose  
 MDS -UPDRS Part  III (Motor Examination) will be assessed  at predose  and hourly for up 
to 10  hours postdose.   
When the subject leaves the clinic after Visit 2 for wash -out and after Visit 4 (end of treatment 
period 2), he/she will revert to his/her prestudy dosing regimen.  
Number of subject s (planned):  Approximately 30 subjects will be randomized to complete 
26.

Safety:    
 electrocardiograms (ECGs), clinical laboratory tests, physical exam ination s, C-SSRS, and 
vital signs  
 adverse events and concomitant medications evaluated throughout the course of the study . 
Statistical methods:   
Pharmacokinetics:  
Descriptive statistics will be presented by treatment group for the PK parameters for 
IR CD-LD and IPX203.  Following natural logarithm transformation, analyses of variance 
(ANOVA) will be performed on CD and LD AUC and C max normalized for dose .  
Additionally , duration of LD plasma concentration abo ve 50% of C max values  will be analyzed 
using ANOVA .  Comparisons will be performed using a mixed -effect ANOVA model that 
includes treatment, period, and sequence as fixed effects and subject -within -sequence as a 
random effect for the following treat ments: IPX203 versus IR  CD-LD. 
Efficacy:  
 Descriptive statistics and frequency distributions will be displayed for all endpoints  
 Primary:   The primary efficacy parameter for this study will be the average percent “off” 
time during waking hours based on subject PD diaries collected at the end of each 
treatment period.  For each day it will be calculated as the number of half -hour intervals in 
which “off” is checked.  The average percent “off” time will be defined as the average of 
percent “off” time (total “off” tim e divided by  the total time not “asleep” (ie, waking 
hours ) from the subject PD diaries completed for the 3 days immediately prior to the visit.   
The difference between the average percent “off” time between treatments will be analyzed 
using a standard mix ed-model analysis of variance at a 0.05 level of significance.  This 
model will include the fixed -effect factors of treatment, and period and the random -effect 
inter- and intra -subject factors.  
 Secondary:   The continuous efficacy endpoints will be evaluate d for differences between 
treatments using a standard mixed -model analysis of variance at a 0.05 level of 
significance.  This model will include the fixed -effect factors of treatment, sequence and 
period and the random -effect inter - and intra -subject facto rs.  The categorical endpoints 
will be analyzed using generalized estimating equations methods.  The model will include 
treatment and period . All comparisons of secondary endpoint will be tested at 5% 
significance level without any multiplicity correction.

Page 19 of 136 4. INTRODUCTION 
Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder of the extrapyramidal 
nervous system.  Levodopa (LD) used in combination with carbidopa (CD) is considered the 
gold standard for the symptomatic treatment of PD.  LD is a dopamine precursor converted to 
dopamine by aromatic amino acid decarboxylase (AADC).  Carbidopa is an AADC inhibitor that 
does not cross the blood-brain barrier.  When used in combination with LD, CD increases the 
plasma half-life of LD from 50 minutes to 1.5 hours.  Carbidopa inhibits the conversion of LD 
into dopamine in the periphery, thereby reducing the peripheral side-effects caused by dopamine 
and increasing the amount of LD available for transport into the brain.  The administration of CD 
with LD reduces the dose of LD required to produce a dopaminergic response by about 
75 percent (Sinemet prescribing information , Appendix A).  
Due to its proven efficacy, LD is prescribed eventually to most subject s with PD.  However, 
long-term use of LD is associated with certain complications , including  “wearing off” or “end -
of-dose effect,” where symptom control decreases resulting in the drug effects to wear off  
sooner .  As the disease progresses further, motor complications, namely dyskinesia s and motor 
“on/off” fluctuations, develop in about 50% of the patients after 5 years of treatment (Fahn 
1999).  Such motor complications can be a significant source of disability and their  management 
is a major unmet need in the treatment of PD. 
Mechanisms underlying motor complications involving dyskinesias and “on/off” fluc tuations in 
PD are unclear.  The pulsatile nature of standard orally administered LD is thought to contribute 
to the appearance of motor complications.  Chronic intermittent pulsatile stimulation of the 
dopamine receptors that are under tonic control contributes to the development of dyskinesia in 
PD animal models as compared to animals treated with continuous infusion ( Juncos 1989 , 
Engber 1989 , Blanchet 1995 ).  In addition, unreliable absorption of LD potentially due to erratic 
gastric empting and variable in vivo dissolution of LD products is thought to contribute to the 
delay or inadequate response after oral dosing with standard CD-LD products ( Melamed 1986, 
Kurlan 1988 , Stocchi 1994 ).  These findings suggest that motor complications in patients with 
PD may be less likely to develop with continuous dopaminergic stimulation. 
Intraduodenal infusion of LD has been shown to significantly reduce motor complications and to 
reduce “off” time.  The findings of infusion studies in PD patients indicate that the maintenance 
of stable plasma LD concentrations and the avoidance of low trough levels are effective in 
reducing “off” hours, increasing “on” hours without disabling dyskinesia, and reducing the 
severity of dyskinesia versus standard oral LD formulations ( Mizuno 2007 , Nilsson 2001 , 
Nyholm 2005 , Stocchi 2005 ).  These findings provide a strong rationale for the development of 
an extended release (ER) oral formulation that delivers a constant LD plasma concentration in 
order to optimize relief of PD symptoms, and to minimize “off” time and dyskinesia.  
IPX203 is an investigational product containing CD-LD that is being developed by Impax 
Laboratories, Inc. through its Impax Specialty Pharma division (Impax).  The primary objective 
of the IPX203 program is to develop an extended release product that can attain therapeutic LD 
plasma concentrations rapidly and maintain constant LD plasma concentrations for a longer 
duration than currently approved products with minimal peak to trough fluctuations.  IPX203 is 
designed to be dos ed approximately every 8 hours, three times a day based on the plasma LD

Page 20 of 136 concentration time profile observed in h ealthy subjects ( Study IPX203 -B14-01) and in subjec ts 
with advanced PD (Study IPX203 -B14-02). 
Study IPX203 -B14-02 characterize d the PK and pharmacodynamics of IPX203 following a 
single dose in subject s with adv anced PD versus IR CD-LD and Rytary.   Twenty -six 
(26) subjects have been randomized .  Preliminary  results are based on data available as of 
August 4, 2016.  At the time of this cutoff,  one subject had discontinued study early due to 
subject withdrawal.  Administration of  IPX203 yielded an initial increase in LD plasma 
concentrations that was similar to both IR and Rytary but maintain ed LD concentrations longer 
than Rytary.   IPX203 provided  a longer duration of effect compared with IR CD-LD and Rytary , 
including “Good On Time”  based on the  Assessment of Subject’s Motor State and on several of 
the MDS -UPDRS -III improvement thresholds .  In this ongoing single dose study , 5 (19.2%, 
5/26) subjects have reported adverse events .  Two subject s (8%, 2/25) reported 3 treatment -
related  AEs after treatment with IPX203  compared with 4 subjects (16.7%, 4/ 24) who reported 
treatment -related AEs after treatment with IR CD-LD.  To date, no subjects in this study have 
reported serious or severe AEs, or have discontinued from the study because of AEs, irrespective 
of treatment.  
Study IPX203 -B16-01 is designed to assess the single - and multiple -dose PK, 
pharmacodynamics, efficacy and safety of IPX203.

6.1. Overall Study Design 
This is a randomized, open-label, rater-blinded, multicenter, 2-treatment, 2-period, multiple-dose 
crossover study.  Approximately 30 advanced PD subjects will be randomized to 1 of 2 dosing 
sequences.  The study duration will be approximately 8 weeks, including the screening period. 
As shown in Figure 1, this study will consist of 4 study visits after Screening:  Day 1 of each 
treatment period (Visits 1 and 3), and Day 15 of each treatment period (Visits 2 and 4).  Study 
Exit procedures are done at the end of Visit 4 or within 3 days of Visit 4, or during an early 
withdrawal.  Between treatment periods, subjects will return to their prestudy PD medication 
regimen during the 1-week (  2 days) washout period.  Subjects may continue to take allowed 
non-CD-LD based PD medications throughout the study if documented in their prestudy regimen 
and if dosing regimens have been stable for at least 4 weeks prior to Visit 1. 
Within 2 weeks following Screening, eligible subjects will complete their PD and Dosing diaries, 
and will wear the Kinesia 360 sensor bands on the more affected side at home immediately after 
waking on each of the 3 days prior to Visit 1.  Subjects will be instructed to take their last dose of 
CD-LD no later than 10:00 PM on the evening prior to Visits 1 and 3.  The first morning dose of 
study medication will be administered at the study site.  On Day 1 of the IR CD-LD treatment 
period, subjects will start with a single dose of their usual prestudy first morning IR CD -LD 
dose.  On Day 1 of the IPX203 treatment period, subjects will start with a single dose of IPX203 
based on their usual prestudy first morning IR CD-LD dose according to the guidance provided 
in Table 3.  During each treatment period subjects will dose for 15 days with study medication.  
During the IR CD -LD treatment period, the initial dosing regimen of IR CD -LD will be the same 
as the subject’s stable prestudy regimen unless they were taking a single daily bedtime dose of 
CR CD -LD, either alone or in combination with IR CD-LD, in which case, the CR CD -LD dose 
will be discontinued and substituted with a 1:1 milligram-equivalent IR CD -LD dose.  A 
“bedtime dose” is defined  as a dose of CR CD -LD taken within 1 hour of the subject’s normal 
nighttime sleep period.  During the IPX203 treatment period, subjects are assigned their initial 
IPX203 dosing regimen according to the guidance provided in Table 4 (see Section 6.4.2 ), which 
is based on each individual’s prestudy IR CD-LD morning dose and daily dosing regimen.  The 
typical dosing regimen for IPX203 will be three times a day, dosed approximately every 7 to 
8 hours.  Some subjects may require more or less frequent dosing to optimize therapeutic effect 
(minimize “off” t ime without causing troublesome dyskinesia or other dopaminergic side 
effects).  Nighttime dosing of study medication is allowed as needed with the exception of the 
evening prior to Day 15 (withhold dosing for at least 5 hours before arriving at the site) of each 
treatment period.  Subjects may continue to take allowed non- CD-LD based PD medications 
throughout the study if documented in their prestudy regimen and if dosing regimens have been 
stable for at least 4 weeks prior to Visit 1. 
During Days 1 throug h 9 of both treatment periods, investigators may adjust each subject’s study 
medication regimen if necessary to optimize efficacy and safety. 
Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic measures are assessed in the clinic for up to 8 hours 
postdose on Day 1 of each treatment period (Visits 1 and 3), and for up to 10 hours on Day 15 of 
Protocol No. IPX203-B16-01 CONFIDENTIAL

Page 23 of 136 each treatment period (Visits 2 and 4).  Additionally, subjects will complete the PD and Dosing 
diaries, and use the Kinesia 360 sensor bands on the ankle and wrist of their mo re affected side 
immediately after waking on each of the 3 days prior to Visits 1, 2, and 4.

IR CD-LD will be supplied as tablets containing 100 mg of LD.  IR CD-LD tablets may be split 
using a pill cutter. 
IPX203 will be supplied as capsules containing 180 mg and 270 mg LD.  The suggested doses 
and regimen of IPX203 are intended to provide an onset of effect comparable to the subject’s 
prestudy IR LD regimen and to extend the duration of effect.  . 
Doses of IPX203 should be based on the subject’s prestudy stable LD dose regimen and the 
response to IPX203.  The typical dosing regimen for IPX203 will be three times a day, dosed 
approximately every 7 to 8 hours.  Some subjects may require more or less frequent dosing to 
optimize therapeutic effect (minimize “off” time without causing troublesome dyskinesia or 
other dopaminergic side effects ). 
6.4.1. Day 1 In-Clinic Dosing at Visit 1 and at Visit 3 
There are two treatment periods in this study.  On Day 1 of the IR CD-LD treatment period, 
subjects will receive a single dose of their usual prestudy first morning IR CD-LD dose.  The 
“first morning dose”  is defined as the subject’s first dose upon awakening for the day 
immediately following the subject’s usual nocturnal sleep  period intended to achieve an “on” 
state. 
On Day 1 of the IPX203 treatment period, subjects will start with a single dose of IPX203 based 
on their usual prestudy first morning dose of IR CD-LD as shown in Table 3.

Rescue :  Subjects who need rescue during the IR CD-LD treatment will receive a dose of 
IR CD-LD that corresponds to their typical pretreatment regimen based on the subject’s dosing 
diary.  For rescue during the IPX203 treatment, subject will receive a dose of IPX203 that is 
based on Table 4 in Section 6.4.2. 
6.4.2. Study Drug Regimen following First In -Clinic Dose at Visits 1 and 3 
The IR CD-LD and IPX203 dosing regimen may be adjusted if needed during the first 9 days of 
each treatment period to achieve adequate efficacy and safety.  The dosing regimen should be 
stable for the last 5 days of each treatment period (Days 10 – 14).

Page 25 of 136 IR LD Dose Adjustment (Days 1-9):  
 During the IR CD -LD treatment period, the initial dosing regimen of IR CD -LD will be 
the subject’s stable prestudy CD -LD regimen. 
 If the subject’s prestudy regimen included a single daily bedtime dose of CR CD -LD, 
either alone or in combination with IR CD -LD, the CR CD -LD dose will be discontinued 
and substituted with a 1:1 milligram-equivalent IR CD -LD dose.  A “bedtime dose” is 
defined as a dose of CR CD-LD taken within 1 hour of the subject’s normal night time 
sleep period.  For example, a 200-mg daily bedtime dose of CR CD -LD will be replaced 
with a 200-mg bedtime dose of IR CD-LD. 
IPX203 Dose Adjustment (Days 1-9):  
Table 4 outlines the suggested initial conversion from a prestudy regimen of CD-LD to an 
IPX203 regimen.  The suggested initial dosing of IPX203 is three times a day, approximately 
every 7 to 8 hours. 
The recommended morning dose of IPX203 is based on Table 3.  
To determine the IPX203 regimen of subsequent doses for the day, identify the most frequent 
prestudy LD dose in milligrams that the subject receives in the afternoon and evening and 
administer IPX203 according to Table 4.  
 If the subject takes different prestudy LD doses with equal frequency, determine the 
IPX203 dose based on the highe st LD dose. 
 When determining the most frequent prestudy LD dose for subsequent IPX203 doses, 
consider all prestudy LD doses taken from noon to bedtime.  If the subject takes a 
bedtime CR CD-LD dose and the subject also takes a dose of IR CD-LD within one hour 
of the bedtime dose of CR CD-LD, then add the CR and IR LD doses together.

 The IPX203 dosing regimen may be adjusted as needed based on the subject ’s response 
to the previous day’s dosing.  Doses of IPX203 may be adjusted in increments of 90 mg 
to achieve adequate therapeutic effects.  The 90 mg adjustments can be achieved by 
adjusting the number of 180 mg and 270 mg capsules.  For example, a 360 mg dose 
(180 mg ×  2 capsules ) can be increased by 90 mg (to 450 mg) by administering a 270 m g 
capsule and a 180 mg capsule. 
 If a subject experiences bothersome peak-related or levodopa- related side effects, the 
doses of IPX203 may be reduced in steps of 90 mg. 
 If a subject experiences end-of- dose “off” episodes with the suggested dose regimen  or if 
persistent “off” periods occur during the day ,  
o the IPX203 dose may be increased (if the subject does not experience troublesome 
dyskinesia), or 
o the time between two doses may be decreased, or 
o the dosing frequency may be increased to achieve an adequate therapeutic effect. 
 IPX203 should not require dosing more than four times a day.  For subjects who require 
an adjustment from three times a day to a four times a day dosing of IPX203, each 
individual dose may need to be reduced by 90-180 mg depending on response. 
Dosing of Study Medication on Days 10 – 14 
For Days 10-14 subjects should maintain the dosing regimen achieved by Day 9. 
Dosing of Study Medication on Day 15  
The IR CD-LD and IPX203 dosing regimens during the clinic visit on Day 15 should be the 
same as the regimens reflected on the last day in the Dosing diary on Days 12-14. 
6.5. Dose Adjustment Criteria 
As detailed in Section 6.4.2 above, a subject ’s IR CD-LD and IPX203 dosing regimen may be 
adjusted for the first 9 days in order to achieve adequate efficacy and safety.

For Visits 2 and 4 complete the following procedures: 
 Record any AEs and update changes in concomitant medication since the previous 
visit. 
 Measure predose vital signs (temperature, respiratory rate, blood pressure, and heart 
rate after supine for at least 5 minutes; orthostatic pulse and blood pressure after 
standing for approximately 2 minutes). 
 Conduct a predose ECG. 
 Collect a predose PK blood sample (6 mL) within 1 hour predose. 
 Qualified clinical staff blinded to the subject’s treatment assignment perform the 
following predose assessments: 1) MDS-UPDRS Parts I-IV; 2) Assessment of 
Subject ’s Motor State (of “on” and “off,” and state of dyskinesia) –1, –0.5, and 
0 hour. 
 Administer C-SSRS. 
 Administer the study medication upon completion of predose procedures.  The 
IR CD-LD and IPX203 dosing regimens during the clinic visit for Day 15 should be 
the same as the regimens reflected on the last day in the Dosing diary on Days 12-14.  
To ensure unbiased data, treatments should be administered by clinical staff not 
directly involved in the assessment of the MDS-UPDRS Part III (Motor Examination) 
and Assessment of Subject’s Motor State.  
8.5.3. Postdose at Visits 2 and 4 
 Collect postdose blood samples (6 mL) for PK analysis at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 
4.5, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 10 hours postdose.

9, 9.5, and 10 hours postdose.  For each subject, the preference is to have the same 
rater perform the assessment at every time point throughout the study. 
 Qualified staff who are blinded to treatment assignment perform MDS-UPDRS 
Part III (Motor Examination) hourly at approximately 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 
10 hours postdose.  For each subject, the preference is to have the same rater perform 
the assessment at every time point throughout the study. 
 When PK sampling and other procedures or measurements are scheduled at the same 
time, the PK sampling shall be done as close as possible to the nominal time. 
 Provide a breakfast containing approximately 5 grams of protein approximately 
1 hour following the morning dose ( Appendix L ).  Lunch may be provided no earlier 
than 4 hours following the morning dose.  Subjects may be provided dinner if needed.  
Subjects may also be provided snacks as long as it is not within 1 hour before or after 
their morning dose.

Page 40 of 136  Perform 12 -lead ECG at 2 hours postdose.  
 Assess vital signs at 2, 4, and 10 hours postdose:  blood pressure, heart rate, and 
respiratory rate will be measured after the subject has been supine fo r at least 
5 minutes.  Orthostatic blood pressure and heart rate will be measured after the 
subject has been standing for approximately 2  minutes.  
 After completion of the10 -hour PK sampling and pharmacodynamic assessments  
instruct the subject to switch back to taking their prestudy PD medications , including 
CD-LD, taking into account the timing of the last dose of study medication (Visits 2 
and 4) and to maintain this regimen until 10:00  PM on the night before the next visit  
(Visit 2 only) . 
 If the  current study medication is IPX203, it is recommended that the next dose of 
CD-LD be withheld for at least 5 hours after the last dose of IPX203.  
8.6. Study Exit/Early Withdrawal Procedures  
All enrolled subjects must complete Study Exit procedures at the end o f Visit 4  or within 3  days 
of Visit 4, or during an early withdrawal visit:  
 Complete physical examination.  
 Vital signs (temperature, respiration, blood pressure and heart rate after supine for at 
least 5  minutes) and orthostatic standing vital signs (blood  pressure and heart rate 
after standing for approximately 2  minutes).  
 Perform a 12 -lead ECG.  
 Perform C -SSRS.  
 Obtain samples for clinical laboratory evaluations (chemistry, hematology, and 
urinalysis).  
 Update concomitant medications.  
 Update AEs.  All ongoin g AEs must be followed until the event has resolved or has 
stabilized.  
 Instruct the subject to switch back to their prestudy PD medications and regimen 
(including IR  CD-LD) and to maintain this dosing regimen unless or until they 
receive alternative instru ctions from their regularly treating physician or health care 
provider.  
8.7. Early Withdrawal  
Subjects who withdraw early should complete Study Exit procedures.  
8.8. Blood Volume  
Safety blood draws:  Approximately 10 mL of blood will be drawn at Screening and at 
Study Exit, for a combined total of 20 mL.  
PK blood draws:  Up to  472 mL will be drawn for subjects who complete both treatment periods.

ASSESSMENTS 
12.1. Pharmacokinetic Assessments 
The following single-dose PK parameters will be calculated from CD and LD plasma 
concentrations for each treatment:  observed maximum CD and LD plasma concentrations (C max) 
and time to maximum concentration (T max); area under the plasma concentration-time curve from 
time zero to the last measurable concentration (AUC 0-t), and from time zero to infinity (AUC 0-∞); 
apparent elimination half-life (t 1/2); and bioavailability of IPX203 relative to IR CD -LD.  
Additionally, time to 50% C max of LD and duration > 50% C max of LD will be calculated for 
IPX203, and IR CD -LD.   Data after redosing on Day 1 (Visit 1 and 3) will not be included in 
these assessments. 
The following parameters will be estimated for LD and CD using data on Day 15 (Visits 2 and 
4): 
 Cmax over the dosing regimen 
 Tmax over the dosing regimen 
 AUC 0-10 
 Accumulation calculated as AUC 0-τ on Day 15/AUC 0-τ on Day 1 
 Fluctuation calculated as (C max – C min)/C avg (maximum [peak] drug concentration 
minus minimum drug concentration divided by average drug concentration), C avg = 
average drug concentration.

Page 48 of 136 13. ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY  
13.1. Safety Parameters  
Safety will be assessed by the following parameters:  
 ECGs, clinical laboratory tests, physical exam inations , the C -SSRS, and vital signs.  
 Adverse events and concomitant medications will  be evaluated over the course of the 
study.  
13.2. Adverse Events  
13.2.1.  Definition of Adverse Event  
An adverse event (adverse experience) is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or 
clinical trial subject administered a medicinal product and which does not neces sarily have to 
have a causal relationship with this treatment.  An adverse event can therefore be any 
unfavorable and unintended sign (eg, an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease 
temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, wheth er or not considered rel ated to 
the medicinal product.  
All AEs and any clinically significant physical examination findings, 12 -lead ECG 
abnormalities, or clinical laboratory measurements occurring during the study that were not 
present prior to administra tion of study medication and that continue at Study Exit should be 
followed and evaluated with additional tests, if necessary, until the AEs are medically stable or 
resolved.  Follow -up on these AEs should be recorded on the source documents and reported t o 
Impax.  
13.2.2.  Recording Adverse Events  
Elicit information about AEs with nonselective questions such as:  “Have you experienced any 
changes in your health status since your last visit?”  Encourage subjects to report AEs at onset.  
Record information for any AE t hat emerges from the time the subject signs the ICF until Study 
Exit.  
Monitor each subject closely for the development of AEs and record all such events on the AE 
page of the CRF.  Whenever possible, group signs and symptoms that constitute a single 
diagno sis.  For example, cough, rhinitis, and sneezing might be grouped as upper respiratory 
infection.  
For each AE, record the onset date, severity, seriousness, relationship to study medication, date 
of resolution (or continuing), action taken, and outcome in the CRF.  The Investigator is to make 
a causality assessment (relationship to study medication) for every AE.  
13.2.3.  Follow -up 
The Investigator must follow each AE until resolved or medically stable.  
Protocol No. IPX203 -B16-01 CONFIDENTIAL  
Amendment 2: October 5 , 2016  Impax Laboratories, Inc.  
Page 49 of 136 13.2.4.  Relationship to Study Drug  
The Investigator documents his/her opinion of the relationship of the AE to the study medication 
as follows:  
 Not Related —the experience can be readily explained by the subject’s underlying 
medical condition or concomitant medications and no relationship exists between the 
study medication a nd the experience.  
 Unlikely Related —the temporal relationship between the AE and the administration 
of the study medication is uncertain and it is likely that the AE can be explained by 
the subject’s medical condition or other therapies.  
 Possibly Related —there is some logical temporal relationship between the AE and 
the administration of the study medication and the experience is unlikely to be 
explained by the subject’s medical condition or other therapies.  
 Related —the temporal relationship is compelling b etween the administration of the 
study medication and the AE cannot be explained by the subject’s medical condition 
or other therapies.  
13.2.5.  Assessment of Severity  
Grade each AE for severity and note in the description of the AE.  Determine the severity 
categor y of mild, moderate, or severe, as defined below, and enter the information on the AE 
page of the CRF.  
 Mild —causing no limitation of usual activities  
 Moderate —causing some limitation of usual activities  
 Severe —causing inability to carry out usual activitie s 
13.3. Serious Adverse Events  
13.3.1.  Definition of Serious Adverse Event  
A serious adverse event (SAE) is any AE occurring at any dose that results in any of the 
following outcomes, regardless of relationship to the study medication:  
 Death  
 A life -threatening adverse d rug experience  
 Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
 A persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
 A congenital anomaly/birth defect  
 Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospitalization may be considered an SAE when, based upon appropriate medical 
judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  
Protocol No. IPX203-B16-01 CONFIDENTIAL 
Amendment 2: October 5, 2016 Impax Laboratories, Inc. 
Page 50 of 136 13.3.2. Reporting Serious Adverse Events 
Any SAE that occurs from the time the subject signs an ICF until 30 days after taking the final 
dose of study medication must be reported by the investigative staff to the Sponsor or the 
Sponsor’s representative within 24 hours of knowledge of the even t (see  Study Contact 
Information ). 
An SAE form must be completed and sent to the Sponsor and/or the Sponsor’s representative.  
All SAEs must also be recorded on the AE page of the CRF.  Additionally, all SAEs must be 
reported to the institutional review board (IRB) per the IRB’s requirements.  
Those SAEs that are considered both serious and unexpected and related to the study drug are 
subject to expedited reporting.  An “unexpected AE” is any AE where the nature or s everity is 
not consistent with the current investigator brochure (IB) or if an IB is not required or available, 
the specificity or severity is not consistent with the provided risk information. 
Unexpected fatal or life-threatening SAEs related to the study drug must be reported by the 
Sponsor to the appropriate regulatory authority in an expedited manner (ie, first report within 
7 days of first knowledge by the Sponsor).  The Sponsor will provide a final written report to that 
authority within 15 days of initial receipt of information on the event.  The Sponsor or the 
Sponsor’s representative will also inform all participating Investigators of the SAE.  
Unexpected SAEs that are not fatal or life-threatening must be reported by the Sponsor to the 
appropriate regulatory authority as soon as possible but no later than 15 calendar days after first 
knowledge of the SAE by the Sponsor.  The Sponsor or the Sponsor’s representative also 
informs all participating Investigators of the SAE. 
Subjects withdrawn from the study due to any SAE will be followed until the SAE is resolved or 
medically stable.  Record all SAEs, regardless of severity and whether or not related to the study 
medication, on the appropriate page of the CRF. 
The Investigator must determine whether the seriousness of the event warrants removal of the 
subject from the study.  He/she should, in any case, institute appropriate diagnostic and 
therapeutic measures and keep the subject under observation for as long as is medically 
indicated, or refer the subject to appropriate health professionals. 
13.4. Pregnancy 
Any pregnancy that occurs from the time the subject signs an ICF until 30 days after taking the 
final dose of study medication must be reported within 24 hours to the Sponsor or the Sponsor’s 
representative and the subject should be terminated from the study.  All pregnancies will be 
followed through to delivery of the infant.  If the subject experiences a termination of the 
pregnancy, it should be reported as defined in Section 13.3.2 . 
13.5. Other Safety Parameters and Related Information 
Additional safety parameters (laboratory tests, 12-lead ECGs, physical examinations, and vital 
signs), the C-SSRS, and concomitant medications are collected as shown in the Schedule of 
Assessments in Table 5 and evaluated over the course of the study.  Clinical laboratory studies 
are listed in Appendix J .

14.1. Study Design and Sample Size Estimation  
Assuming a difference of 1.75 hours between the treatments in “off” time and the st andard 
deviation of the treatment differences to be 3 hours, this 2-way crossover design will have 80% 
power to detect a difference between IPX203 and IR  CD-LD with at least 26 subjects completing 
the study (level of significance  = 0.05).  
To allow for a dr opout rate of approximately 15%, at least 30 subjects will be randomized to 
ensure at least 26 completers.  
For efficacy, a  subject will be considered a completer  if the subject receiv es treatments in both 
periods and has at least 2 days of evaluable PD diary data for each period.  
For pharmacodynamic assessments , a completer will be  defined as a subject who has received 
both treatments and has completed at least 4 postdose Assessments of Subjects’ Motor State in 
each period . 
14.2. Demogra phics/Baseline Comparability  
The demographics and baseline characteristics for all subjects enrolled in the study will be 
summarized.  
14.3. Analysis of Pharmacokinetic Data  
The following PK parameters will be calculated from the CD and LD plasma concentrations 
following single doses of each treatment  (IPX 203 and IR  CD-LD):

Page 52 of 136 Additionally, time to 50% C max of LD and duration > 50% C max of LD will be calculated for 
IPX203, and IR CD -LD.  Data after redosing on Day 1 (Visit 1 and 3) will not be included in 
these assessments. 
The following parameters will be estimated for LD and CD following multiple dosing (Day 15): 
 Cmax over the dosing regimen 
 Tmax over the dosing regimen 
 AUC 0-10 
 Accumulation 
 Fluctuation 
 
Descriptive statistics will be presented by treatment group and LD dose for the PK parameters 
for IR CD -LD and IPX203.  Following natural logarithm transformation, analyses of variance 
(ANOVA) will be performed on CD and LD AUC and C max adjusted for dose, fluctuation, and 
accumulation .  Additionally, duration of LD plasma concentration above 50% of C max values will 
be analyzed using ANOVA.  Comparisons will be performed using a mixed-effect ANOVA 
model that includes treatment, period, and sequence as fixed effects and subject-within-sequence 
as a random effect for the following treatments: IPX203 versus IR CD-LD.  All PK analyses will 
be done following current recommendations ( Food and Drug Administration 2003 ). 
14.4. Analysis of Efficacy Data 
Descriptive statistics and frequency distributions will be displayed for all endpoints. 
14.4.1. Primary Efficacy Endpoint 
The primary efficacy parameter for this study will be the average percent “off” time during 
waking hours based on subject PD diaries collected at the end of each treatment period.  For each 
day it will be calculated as the number of ha lf-hour intervals in which “off” is checked.  The 
average percent “off” time will be defined as the average of percent “off” time (total “off” time 
divided by the total time not “asleep ,” (ie, waking hours) from the subject PD diaries completed 
for the 3 days immediately prior to the visit.  The difference between the average percent “off” 
time between treatments will be analyzed using a standard mixed-model analysis of variance at a 
0.05 level of significance.  This model will include the fixed-effect factors of treatment, and 
period and the random-effect inter- and intra-subject factors.   
14.4.2. Secondary Efficacy Endpoint 
The continuous efficacy endpoints will be evaluated for differences between treatments using a 
standard mixed-model analysis of variance at a 0.05 level of significance.  This model will 
include the fixed-effect factors of treatment, sequence and period and the random-effect inter- 
and intra-subject factors.  All comparisons of secondary endpoint will be tested at 5% 
significance level without any multiplicity correction. 
The following efficacy parameters will be analyzed using mixed-model analysis in a fashion 
similar to the primary efficacy endpoint:

marked “off” will be calculated.  The difference  between the averages of total “off” 
time between the two treatments will be analyzed.  
 Average time “on” with no troublesome dyskinesia (good on) – From the subject PD 
diaries, the sum of the number  of half -hour interval s marked “ on without dyskinesia” 
and “on with non -troublesome dyskinesia” will be calculated.  The difference 
between  the averages of total time “on with no troublesome dyskinesia ” between the 
two treatments will be analyzed.  
 Average of total “on” time with no dyskinesia – From the subject PD diaries, the sum 
of the number  of half -hour intervals marked “ on without dyskinesia” will be 
calculated.  The difference between  the averages of total time “on time with no

 Average of total “on” time with non -troublesome dyskinesia  – From the subject PD 
diaries, the sum of the number of half -hour intervals marked “on with non-
troublesom e dyskinesia” will be calculated.  The difference between the averages of 
total time “on with non-troublesome dyskinesia” between the two treatments will be 
analyzed.  
 Average of total time asleep  – From the subject PD diaries, the sum of the number of 
half-hour intervals marked “ asleep ” will be calculated.  The difference between the 
averages of total time “a sleep ” between the two treatments will be analyzed.  
 Average of t otal off time normalized for 16 waking hours:  Normalize the off time by 
multiplying th e proportion of off time during the waking hours with 16 hours.  The 
difference between the averages of total off time normalized for 16 waking hours  
between the two treatments will be analyzed.  
 Average of t otal on time with no troublesome dyskinesia norma lized for 16 waking 
hours:  Normalize the on time with no troublesome dyskinesia by multiplying the 
proportion of on time with no troublesome dyskinesia time during the waking  hours 
with 16 hours.  The difference between the averages of total on time with no 
troublesome dyskinesia normalized for 16 waking hours  between the two treatments 
will be analyzed.

have the greatest effect on Part II (activities of daily living) and Part III (motor 
examination), the sum of these two parts will be analyzed.  The difference between 
the averages of the total MDS -UPDRS Parts II and III scores for the two treatments 
will be analyzed.  
 Change in the dyskinesia, mobility, and tremor measures obtained using the 
Kinesia  360. 
The proportion of subjects with an improvement of at least 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, and 3 hours in the “off” 
time will be analyzed using generalized estimating equations methods.  The model will  include 
treatment and period.   The p roportion of subjects in “off” state w ithin the first 30 minutes of 
awakening  for the day immediately following the subject’s usual nocturnal sleep period  will also

the three days will also be anal yzed.  
14.5. Analysis of Pharmacodynamics Data  
Descriptive statistics and frequency distributions will be displayed for all pharmacodynamic 
endpoints.  
The continuous endpoints will be evaluated for differences between treatments using a standard 
mixed -model analysis of variance at a 0.05 level of significance.  This model will include the 
fixed -effect factors of treatment, sequence and period and the random -effect inter - and intra -
subject factors.   The following analysis will be conducted for Day 1 and Day 15  endpoints:  
 Average  total “off” time will be derived from the Assessment of Subject’s Motor State 
every 30  minutes.  It will be based on the sum of half-hour intervals marked “off ”. 
 Average total time “on” without troublesome dyskinesia  (good on) :  Estimat ed using total 
“on” time without dyskinesia and “on” with nontroublesome dyskinesia based on the sum 
of half -hour intervals marked “on” without dyskinesia and “on” with non -troublesome 
dyskinesia.  
 Average  total time “on” with  no dyskinesia:  Estimated using  total “on” with  no 
dyskinesia based on sum of half -hour intervals marked “on” without dyskinesia.  
 Average total time “on” with troublesome dyskinesia:  Estimated using total “on” with 
troublesome dyskinesia will be based on sum of half -hour intervals  marked “on” with 
troublesome dyskinesia.  
 Average total time “on” with non -troublesome dyskinesia:  Estimated using total “on” 
with non -troublesome dyskinesia based on sum of half -hour intervals marked “on” with 
non-troublesome dyskinesia.  
 Average total ti me asleep:  Estimated using total time asleep based on sum of half -hour 
intervals marked asleep.  
 Average of  change in MDS -UPDRS Part III score from Day 1 predose value to each 
postdose time  point.

Page 55 of 136  To determine the effect of IPX203, average of the area unde r the curve (AUC) for the 
change from predose in the MDS -UPDRS Part III score  
 Duration of effect using time  points at which an improvement of at least 4 points in the 
MDS -UPDRS Part III score from predose is observed will be estimated.  The difference 
in mean duration of effect between treatments will be analyzed using a mixed -effect 
ANOVA model which will include treatment, period, and sequence as fixed effects and 
subject -within -sequence as a random effect.  To determine the duration of effect, the 
midway  point between two adjacent time  points will be used.  For example, if a subject 
does not have 4 units of improvement from the predose MDS -UPDRS Part III assessment 
at the 1 -hour postdose assessment, but has an improvement at the 2 -hour postdose 
assessment , and loses the 4 -unit improvement at the 3 -hour assessment, the duration of 
effect will be considered as 1 hour using the interpolated time value.   Similar analysis 
will be conducted for  an improvement of at least 7 and 13 points in the MDS -UPDRS 
Part III  score from predose.  
 Average of change in sum of questions 4 through 8 and question 14 MDS -UPDRS 
Part III score from Day 1 predose value at each time  point  to assess bradykinesia.  
 Average of change in each question 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 14 of MDS -UPDRS Part II I 
separately  from Day 1 predose value at each time  point  to assess bradykinesia.  
The categorical endpoints will be analyzed using generalized estimating equations methods.  The 
model will include treatment and period.  All comparisons of secondary endpoint  will be tested 
at 5% significance level without any multiplicity correction.  
14.6. Analysis of Dosing Data  
The IPX203 daily dose and frequency of dosing will be collected during this study to further 
assess optimal dosing and dosing instructions for advanced -stage PD population subject s who 
were treated with IR  CD-LD previously.  
14.7. Population Analysis and Handling of Dropouts  
Subjects who discontinue early will not be replaced.  
All subjects treated with any study medication will be included in the safety analyses.  
For pharmacodynamic analysis, all available data obtained on subjects who receive both 
treatments and have at least 4 postdose Assessment of Subject’s Motor State for each treatment 
will be included in the analysis.  
For subjects who receive rescue medicati on or who discontinue the study assessments prior to 
the Hour 8 (Visit 1 and 3) and Hour 10 (Visit 2 and 4) assessment  on Day 1 , the following rules 
will be applied for various evaluations:  
 Assessment of Subject’s Motor State —all half -hour assessments afte r rescue 
medication is administered will be considered as “off” for the remainder of the 
evaluation period.  
 MDS -UPDRS Part III —the predose sum of MDS -UPDRS Part III will be carried 
forward for all time  points after rescue medication administration.

Page 56 of 136 Imputat ion of missing data for subject PD diaries will be required if the PD diary is not 
completed for a day (6 am to 6 am).  In this case, the method of imputation will be dependent 
upon the amount and pattern of missing data:  
 If more than four half -hour time intervals are missing, then that particular day will not 
be included in the analysis.  
 If a half -hour time interval is missing and the observations on either side of the time 
interval are not missing, then the missing time interval will be imputed by assign ing a 
value of the previous measurement for the first 15  minutes and the value of the next 
measurement for the second 15 minutes.  
 If two or more consecutive half -hour time intervals are missing, not to exceed a total 
of four, and these time intervals are a vailable from other days of the visit, then the 
following rules will be applied:  
 For missing values on Day 1, data from Day 2 will be used for imputation for the 
same time intervals.  If Day 2 data is also incomplete then Day 3 data will be 
used.  
 For missi ng values on Day 2, data from Day 3 will be used for imputation if 
available; otherwise Day 1 data will be used.  
 For missing values on Day 3, data from Day 2 will be used for imputation if 
available; otherwise Day 1 data will be used for imputation.  
 If dat a at the same time period is missing across all days, the individual missing 
half-hour intervals will be split into two periods, with the first half -interval being 
imputed with data from the immediate previous nonmissing time period and the 
second half -interval being imputed with the next nonmissing time interval.  
14.8. Safety  
The safety analysis will include all subjects who receive at least 1 dose of study medication.  
Reported AEs will be coded to standard terms using a standard dictionary (Medical Dictionary 
for Regulatory Activities [MedDRA]).  All AEs will be summarized by body system, and by 
preferred terms within a body system, by severity, and by relation to study medication.  Each AE 
(based on preferred terminology) is counted only once for a given subje ct within a treatment .  If 
the same AE occurred on multiple occasions, the highest severity and least complimentary 
relationship was assumed.  If two or more AEs were reported as a unit, the individual terms will 
be reported as separate AEs.  
The incidence of treatment -emergent AEs, as well as, SAEs will be analyzed.  
The secondary safety variables including early termination data, laboratory test data, physical 
examination data, vital signs, ECGs, the C -SSRS and concomitant medications will be tabulated.  
Clinical laboratory values are to be summarized by visit, including change from baseline.  
Medically  significant laboratory values outside of normal reference ranges will also be tabulated 
and assessed.

Page 120 of 136 APPENDIX  G. KINESIA  360 SYSTEM  
 
The Kinesia 360 system allows for continuous, passive symptom monitoring using motion 
sensors worn on the wrist and ankle.  Data collected by the motion sensors is transformed and 
analyzed using validated algorithms to provide data on tremor, akine sia, dyskinesia, and 
mobility.  
Included in the Kinesia 360 system is a smartphone configured with the Kinesia 360 application 
and two motion sensors.  Upon waking on the scheduled days of use, subjects press the Start 
button within the Kinesia 360 applicat ion and put the motion sensors on the wrist and ankle of 
the more affected side of the body.  Subjects then go about their day as they normally would.  At 
the end of the day before going to bed, subjects remove the motion sensors and press the End 
button w ithin the Kinesia 360 application.  Motion sensor data is uploaded to the cloud where it 
is processed using validated algorithms, and a report is generated which displays symptom 
detection and severity details.  Overnight, the motion sensors and smartphone  recharge so they 
are ready for the next day of use.  
 
Please see the following Quick Start Guide  for instructions on set up and use of the Kinesia  360 
system.

Page 133 of 136 APPENDIX  K. BLOOD SAMPLE LABELIN G, PROCESSING, STORA GE 
AND SHIPMENT  
Sample Labeling :  The label s for all sample collection and storage containers will contain the 
subject ID  (include all six digits ), the subject’s initials, dosing period, nominal time, collection 
date, study number, and sample number (sequentially per period, eg, 1 -1 to 1 -15 for Per iod 1 and 
2-1 to 2 -15 for Period  2). 
Collection of PK Blood Samples :  Blood samples for PK analysis will be collected at times as 
specified in the protocol.  The actual time of sample collection will be recorded.  
Sample Processing and Storage :  One 6 mL sample of blood will be drawn at each sampling 
time point.  Approximately 2 mL of blood will be drawn and discarded before collection of each 
PK sample, except for the predose PK sample.  Prior to dosing, an IV catheter will be inserted 
into an arm vein.  The catheter site will be covered with a clear sterile dressing and the catheter 
will be maintained until after the 10 -hour PK sample has been obtained.  Each PK sample will be 
collected into a chilled (~4°C) 6 mL K 2-EDTA vacutainer tube.  The tube must be  placed 
immediately into an ice bath or a Kryorack (or similar) that has been chilled in the freezer (~0°C) 
overnight and equilibrated at room temperature for 1 hour before use to prevent hemolysis due to 
freezing.  Each Kryorack should only be used for a maximum of 6 hours.  Therefore, samples 
from later time  points must use a freshly equilibrated Kryorack.  
Blood samples must be centrifuged within 30 minutes of collection for approximately 15  minutes 
at approximately 3400 rpm at 4°C.  Immediately pipette 1 .0 mL of plasma from each sample into 
each of 2 polypropylene tubes pretreated with sodium metabisulfite and hydrazine 
dihydrochloride (see below) labeled as “Aliquot A” and “Aliquot B” and vortex for 
approximately 20 seconds.  Immediately store samples at  –70°C ± 15°C until shipment.  
The time between sample collection and freezer storage should not exceed 1.5 hours.  The 
prepared plasma samples will be shipped to a bioanalytical laboratory for sample analysis.  
For each 1 mL of plasma, e ach pretreated polyp ropylene tube must contain 25 μL of 20% (w/v) 
hydrazine dihydrochloride solution and 25 µL of 20% (w/v) sodium metabisulfite solution.  The 
20% (w/v) hydrazine dihydrochloride solution and the 20% (w/v) sodium metabisulfite solution 
should be prepared and stored separately not more than 4 days before each treatment period.  The 
solutions should not be used after 4 days.   The pretreated tube s should be prepared on the day of 
use or at the earliest on Day –1.  If prepared on Day –1, the capped pretreated tube s should be 
kept in fridge (4°C) but may  be kept at room temperature away from heat and tightly capped.  
Detailed instructions for the preparation of the two solutions and the pretreated tubes are 
provided in a separate document.  
In cases where the plasma volume is less than 1.0 mL, use the following guide to correct the 
volume.

Transfer or Shipment of Samples :  The sample inventory record must accompany the frozen 
plasma samples.  
For sample transfer, the inventoried samples will be released to the custody of the bioanalytical 
laboratory staff for audit, inventory control, and sto rage.  Notification of sample transfer must  be 
communicated to the Sponsor in writing.  
For shipment, the samples should  be packed in ample dry ice within a container and shipped by 
overnight express to the bioanalytical laboratory .  Notification of sample shipment should  be 
communicated in writing to the bioanalytical laboratory  and Sponsor.  The samples should  be 
tracked by clinical site  staff to confirm  delivery in a safe and timely manner.  The second set of 
samples must only be shipped after the Bioanal ytical laboratory has confirmed receipt of  the first 
set.

Visits 1 and 3 IPX203 Dose Adjustment (Days 1- 9): 
Table 4  outlines the suggested initial conversion from 
a prestudy regimen of CD -LD to an IPX203 regimen. 
The morning dose of IPX203 will be based on the 
recommended dose shown in Table 3. 
To determine the IPX203 regimen of subsequent 
doses for the day, de termine the most frequent 
prestudy LD dose in milligrams that the subject 
receives in the afternoon and evening and administer 
IPX203 according to Table 4 .  Dose IPX203 three 
times a day, approximately every 7  to 8 hours.  IPX203 Dose Adjustment (Days 1- 9): 
Table 4  outlines the suggested initial conversion from a 
prestudy regimen of CD -LD to an IPX203 regimen.  
The suggested initial dosing of IPX203 is three times a day, approximately every 7 to 8 hours.   
The recommended  morning dose of IPX203 is  will be 
based on the recommended dose shown in Table 3 . 
To determine the IPX203 regimen of subsequent doses 
for the day, determine  identify  the most frequent 
prestudy LD dose in milligrams that the subject receives 
in the afternoon and evening and administer IPX203 
according to Table 4 .  Dose IPX203 three times a day, 
approximately every 7  to 8 hours. 
• If the subject takes different prestudy LD doses with equal frequency, determine the IPX203 
dose based on the highe st LD dose . 
• When determining the most frequent prestudy 
LD dose for subsequent IPX203 doses, consider 
all prestudy LD doses taken from noon to bedtime.   If the subject takes a bedtime CR CD -
LD dose and the subject also takes a dose of IR CD-LD within one hour of the bedtime dose of 
CR CD- LD, then add the CR and IR LD doses 
together.

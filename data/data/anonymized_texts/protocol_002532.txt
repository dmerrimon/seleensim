The purpose  of this study  is to evaluate  the PicoWay® Laser  System  with 730 nm handpiece 
and Resolve ™ Fusion 1064 nm and 532 nm fractional handpieces for the treatment for  
benign pigmented lesions including dyschromia, and wrinkles including fine  lines.  
 
4. Background  
The use of lasers to selectively target chromophores in the skin was first described by 
Anderson and Parrish in 19831 which led directly to the development of the first pulsed 
dye laser to be used in dermatology to treat vascular lesions. As laser technology 
advanced shorter pulse duration lasers, such as nanosecond pulse duration domain Q - 
switched Ruby and Nd:YAG lasers among others, were develo ped to safely and 
effectively remove tattoos and pigmented lesions using the same principles of selective 
photothermolysis.3-5 Further advances led to the introduction of lasers with pulse 
durations in the picosecond domain including the Nd:YAG at waveleng ths of 532 
nm,1064 nm; and the alexandrite at 755 nm which have both been demonstrated as safe 
and effective for treatment of benign pigmented lesions, wrinkles, tattoo removal, and 
other indications.6-13 
 
5. Study  Design  
This is a prospective, non -randomized , multi -center, evaluator blinded, safety and 
efficacy clinical study. Subjects will serve as their own control as the appearance of their 
benign pigmented lesions and/or wrinkles at baseline is compared to the appearance 
following laser treatment.  
 
6. Study  Overview  
Subjects will participate in a Screening Visit to evaluate the presence of benign 
pigmented lesions including dyschromia, or wrinkles including fine lines. After evaluating 
all inclusion and exclusion criteria, and providing signed informed consen t, subjects will 
be considered enrolled in the study and assigned a unique identification number that will 
appear on all records for that subject as the Subject ID.  
 
Subjects will then either be scheduled for the Baseline / Treatment Visit #1 at a later 
date, or the Screening and Baseline / Treatment #1 Visits may be combined into the 
same visit.  
 
Subjects will receive up to four (4) study laser treatments at 6 ± 2 week treatment 
intervals.  
 
NOTE: Fewer than four (4) Treatment Visits may be required to reach maximum 
expected clinical results in some subjects. Treatments may therefore be stopped, and 
subject placed into the Follow -Up phase at the discretion of the Investigator.  
 
The Study Doctor or s taff will make up to three (3) attempts to contact subjects by 
telephone 10 days after each treatment to assess healing response.  
   
 
IRB APPROVED_PWY18010_PROT_ V1.0 28NOV2018       Page 10 of 35  After the final study laser treatment, subjects will be schedule for three (3) follow -up 
visits at 4 ± 2 w eek intervals, or approximately 1, 2 and 3 months.  
 
After successful completion of the 12 week follow -up visit, subjects will be exited from 
the study.  
 
7. Study  Population  
Up to 160 subjects will be enrolled in this study at up to two (2) investigational sites in the 
United States.  
 
The Study Population will be enrolled at the discretion of the Investigator after 
determining that eligible subjects have unwanted benign pigmented lesions including 
dyschromia on the face, scalp, neck, chest, b ack, arms, hands, legs or feet; or wrinkles 
including fine lines on the face.  
 
Subjects will be assessed at the Screening Visit and allocated to one or both study sub - 
groups if eligible:  
 
Group A: Benign Pigmented Lesions including dyschromia 
Group B: Wri nkles including fine lines  
The logic scheme used for group allocation is provided below in Figure 1. 
Figure 1: Study Group Allocation Logic  
 
 
All subjects must satisfy the inclusion and exclusion criteria and provide signed informed 
consent to be eligible for participation in the study. Subjects enrolled in the study can 
discontinue their participation at any time for any reason without prejudice or reduction in 
the quality of their medical care. The Investigator or Sponsor can terminate a subject' s 
participation in this study at any time to protect the subject's health or if a subject fails to

optional and will only be performed after written consent is obtained from the subject.  
The Investigator will determine if biopsies are n eeded based on the condition being 
treated, location, or other factors. Performance of the biopsy typically follows these 
steps:  
 
a) Skin biopsies will be collected at or near the treatment  area.  
b) Biopsy site will be cleansed with isopropanol alcohol or  simila r. 
c) Local anesthetic injection (lidocaine or similar medication) will be administered 
intradermally to the biopsy site prior to  collection.  
d) Biopsy will be collected using sterile, single use disposable 2 mm to 4 mm punch 
biopsy.  
e) Sutures may be used to close the biopsy site as  needed.  
f) Biopsies will be placed in a container labeled with Subject’s ID number and date  of 
collection.  
g) Biopsies will be fixed and processed for hematoxylin and eosin staining and/or 
scanning electron microscopy according to labora tory guidelines.  
 
Anesthesia  
To reduce pain and discomfort during laser treatment, the Investigator may recommend 
use of a topical anesthetic product, such as EMLA or LMX -4 cream, which is applied to 
the intended treatment area for approximately 60 minutes  prior to treatment. The 
Investigator may also recommend use of a local intradermal injection of anesthesia, such 
as lidocaine or similar medication. Nonmedicinal methods may also be offered such as 
simple ice packs, or devices that provide cold air , such  as a Zimmer cooling device (Cryo 
6, Zimmer Medizin Systems, Irvine, CA). Subjects may also elect to be treated without 
anesthesia.  
 
Test Spots  
Test spots may be performed prior to treatment to help the Investigator establish 
appropriate treatment paramete rs to achieve the desired clinical endpoint such as 
erythema or whitening. Test spot parameters will be guided by subject skin type, lesion 
type, color or location among other factors. The procedure for test spots involves 
delivering a laser pulse to the s kin at or near the treatment area using a low energy, 
fluence or other setting, and then increasing the relevant parameters until the desired 
clinical endpoint is achieved. For the PicoWay® laser system the clinical endpoint is most 
commonly erythema or whitening of the skin.  
 
Laser Treatment  
Study laser treatments will be administered using treatment parameters recommended by 
the manufacturer and study Sponsor, Candela Corporation. The treatment location, 
wavelength, handpiece, pulse energy, number of passes, and number of pulses will be 
documented in the case report form.  
   
 
IRB APPROVED_PWY18010_PROT_ V1.0 28NOV2018       Page 15 of 35  Benign pigmented lesions including dyschromia will typically be treated with either the 
532 nm or 1064 nm Resolve ™ Fusion, or 730 nm handpiece.  
 
Wrinkles including fine lines will typically be treated with the 1064 nm Resolve ™ Fusion 
handpiece.  
 
The investigator will determine the treatment specific parameters including wavelength, 
energy, fluence, spot size and repetition rate for each subject based on the type, color 
and location of the lesion among other factors. For darker skin types FST V and  FST VI 
the 1064 nm wavelength is most commonly used.  
 
Pain Assessment  
Immediately after each treatment subjects will be asked to rate the amount of pain 
experienced during treatment using an 11 -point Subject Pain Scale ranging from 0 (No 
Pain) to 10 (Extr eme Pain). The Subject Pain Scale is provided in Appendix C.  
 
Local Skin Response Assessment  
Local skin responses will be assessed and recorded following each laser treatment, 
normally within the first 30 minutes. The Local Skin Response Form is provided i n 
Appendix E and includes the following most commonly observed skin responses which 
are both anticipated and in some instances desired clinical endpoints:  
 
• Erythema  
• Edema  
• Whitening  
• Petechiae  
• Pinpoint  Bleeding  
• Purpura  
• Crusting  
• Blistering  
• Burning  
 
Safety Assessment  
Local skin responses occurring from prior laser treatments that are deemed more serious 
due will be recorded as Adverse Device Effects (ADE) on the appropriate study case 
report form. Examples of anticipated ADE that can be observed follo wing treatment with 
the PicoWay ™ laser include:  
 
• Hyperpigmentation  
• Hypopigmentation  
• Scarring  
• Infection  
• Herpes Simplex  Activation  
   
 
IRB APPROVED_PWY18010_PROT_ V1.0 28NOV2018       Page 16 of 35  Although highly uncommon in conjunction with PicoWay® laser treatments, any 
Unanticipated Adverse Device Effects (UADE) will also be recorded on case report forms 
and reported to the Sponsor and IRB as required.  
 
Post-Treatment Care Instruction  
Subjects will receive instructions on post -treatment care of their treated areas. These 
may include the appli cation of a petrolatum gel (such as Aquaphor® or Vaseline®); use of 
a topical corticosterioid (such as Cortizone®); avoiding sun exposure or use of tanning 
equipment; and use of a sunscreen with sun protection factor (SPF) 30 or greater for the 
duration of  study.  
 
Telephone Contacts  
The Study Doctor or staff will make up to three (3) attempts to contact subjects by 
telephone 10 days after each treatment (+/ - 7 Days) to assess healing response.  
 
 
10.3.  Follow -Up Visits  
Subjects will be scheduled for follow -up visits at 4 ± 1 weeks, 8 ± 2 weeks, and 12 ± 2 
weeks after their final study treatment visit, or approximately 1, 2 and 3 months.  
Additional visits may be scheduled by the Investigator as needed.  
 
Photography  
Treatment areas will be photographed at all follow -up visits using the same camera 
settings used previously at Baseline and Treatment Visits.  
 
Subject Satisfaction  
Subjects will be asked to rate their level of satisfaction with the study treatments thus far 
at each follow -up visit using the S ubject Satisfaction Scale provided in Appendix C.  
 
Skin Biopsy (optional)  
Subjects who have provided prior written consent may have one or more skin biopsy 
taken from the treated area at the discretion of the Investigator. Biopsy procedure details 
are prov ided in the Treatment Visit section above.

18. Blinded Evaluation  
Efficacy endpoints will be determined from the data gathered by blinded evaluators 
scoring clinical photography. Three qualified, non -treating clinicians will be trained to 
independently review Baseline and post -treatment pho tograph sets for each subject. The 
identity of the subjects will be masked when possible. No information will be provided to 
the evaluators that may allow them to determine the Baseline from the post -treatment 
photography. Evaluators will then examine pair s of Baseline and post -treatment 
photographs presented in a randomized fashion, and be asked to identify which is the 
Baseline, and to rate any perceived improvement using the Pigment Clearance Scale or 
Fitzpatrick Wrinkle Scale as appropriate for the cond ition treated.  
 
19. Statistical  Methods  
 
19.1.  Statistical Plan  Overview  
The study will be conducted with two separate strata (pigment, wrinkles) which will be 
evaluated. Benign pigmented lesions including dyschromia (Group A) and wrinkles 
including fine lines (Group B) will be separately powered and analyzed for efficacy and 
safety while both groups will further be combined for safety analyses. All study sites will 
be eligible to enroll subjects into each stratum; no subject will be enrolled into both strata.  
 
Subjects participating in the pigment treatment stratum will be evaluated using the 
Pigment Clearance Score (Appendix A) while subjects participating in the wrinkle 
treatment stratum will be evaluated using the Fitzpatrick Wrinkle Score (Appendix B). All 
study subjects will also be evaluated using the Subject Pain Scale (Appendix C), Subject 
Satisfaction Survey (Appendix D), the Local Skin Response (Appendix E), and will be 
evaluated for safety according to 21 CFR Part 812 as well as ICH guidelines (E3 and E6) 
and ISO 14385:2016 as applicable.  
 
A statistical analysis plan (SAP) will be finalized prior to study initiation. The database 
will be constructed using Microsoft Office Excel (Microsoft, Redmond, WA). The 
database will be locked following a review of all protocol deviations to be classified as a 
major or minor deviation. Major and minor protocol deviations will be reviewed once all 
data undergo source document verification and prior to database lock. The independent 
biostatistician will determine major  vs. minor protocol deviations.  
   
 
IRB APPROVED_PWY18010_PROT_ V1.0 28NOV2018       Page 23 of 35  Data analyses will be performed using SAS Version 9.3 or later (SAS Institute, Cary NC) 
and StatXact Version 10 or later (StatXact, Cambridge MA). All analyses will be 
performed in a GCP environment controlled by SOPs.  
 
19.2.  Hypotheses  
 
Null and alternative hypotheses are stratum specific. They assess the change from 
Baseline to Week 12/study exit.  
 
Pigment effectiveness (5 -point ordinal scale, 5 is best) will be evaluated according to the 
following null and alternative hypotheses for Group A:  
 
• Null Hypothesis: Less than 50% experience good to excellent improvement in the 
Pigment Clearance Score (PCS)  
• Alternative Hypothesis: At least 80% experience good to excellent improvement in 
PIS. 
 
Fitzpatrick Wrinkle Score (9 -point ordinal scale, 1 is best) will be evaluated separately for 
peri-orbital wrinkles and peri -oral wrinkles as well as the sum according to the following 
null and alternative hypotheses for Group B:  
 
• Null Hypothesis: There is  no mean improvement in the Fitzpatrick Wrinkle Score 
(FWS)  
• Alternative Hypothesis: There is at least a 2 -point mean improvement in  FWS.  
 
19.3.  Sample Size  
The following summarizes the sample size required to achieve 80% power separately for 
pigmentation Group A  and Group B for their respective primary efficacy endpoints.  
 
From Kung, et al, 2018, Graph 1 indicates that for clearance of pigmentation, 0% 
experienced complete improvement (Grade 5: >95%), 53.8% experienced excellent  
(Grade 4: 75 -94%) improvement, whi le 30.8% experienced good (Grade 3: 50 -74%) 
improvement from baseline. With 30 evaluable subjects, there is 80% power to reject a 
50% improvement rate in favor of a 75% improvement rate according to a two -sided 
exact binomial test with 5% Type I error. Sta tistical significance will be achieved if 69% 
improvement is observed at 12 week follow -up / study exit visit.  
 
From Fitzpatrick, et al, 1996, Table 2 indicates for peri -orbital and peri -oral wrinkles, the 
mean changes from baseline to study exit were 2.34  points and 2.25 points with 
standard deviations < 2 points. With 34 evaluable subjects, there is 80% power to 
detect a 1 -point improvement from baseline according to a two -sided paired t -test with 
5% Type I error. Statistical significance will be achieved  if a 0.7 mean improvement is 
observed from Baseline to 12 week follow -up / study exit with a 2 -point standard 
deviation.  
   
 
IRB APPROVED_PWY18010_PROT_ V1.0 28NOV2018       Page 24 of 35  19.4.  Effectiveness  Analyses  
 
The skin pigmentation score will be evaluated using a paired t -test separately for the peri- 
orbital, peri -oral, and combined outcomes from baseline to study exit. In addition, the 
percentage achieving a 1 -point improvement will also be displayed with two -sided 95% 
confidence intervals to support regulatory submissions requiring 1 -point impr ovement 
analyses.  
 
Wrinkle score improvement will be evaluated using a two -sided exact binomial test.  
 
The Subject Pain Scale and Subject Satisfaction Score will be evaluated by displaying 
the distributions with the range, mean, and two -sided 95% confidence intervals provided. 
Results will be displayed separately for Groups A and Group B.  
 
The effectiveness analyses will be performed using a Per Protocol (PP) population which 
excludes subjects with major protocol deviations such as subjects withdra wn prior to final 
evaluation.  
 
 
19.5.  Safety  Analyses  
 
Safety will be evaluated using the Local Skin Response (Appendix E) which will 
specifically assess the following nine pre -defined safety endpoints: erythema, edema, 
whitening, petechiae, pinpoint bleeding, p urpura, crusting, blistering, burn, as well as 
other to be graded on a 5 -point ordinal score.  
 
Safety will be evaluated in the Intent to Treat (ITT) population which includes all treated 
subjects. Safety results will be displayed separately for Groups A an d Group B. 
Analyses will include a summary of the incidence, severity, and relatedness of all 
reported local skin responses, adverse device effects, and unanticipated adverse device 
effects. In addition, the percentage with no adverse device effects will a lso be reported 
as well as the percentage according to worst overall degree; a similar evaluation will be 
performed for the worst degree for those at least related to the study treatment. The 
percent reporting each ordinal score per safety endpoint will be  presented separately for 
each stratum and  combined.  
 
20. Histological  Analysis  
 
20.1.  Light  Microscopy  
 
Skin biopsies will be processed for routine hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) tissue staining to 
allow light microscopy analysis of laser -tissue effects such as acute skin and pigment 
changes, wound healing, or other morphologic changes.  
   
 
IRB APPROVED_PWY18010_PROT_ V1.0 28NOV2018       Page 25 of 35  20.2.  Scanning Electron  Microscopy  
 
Skin biopsies may be processed for scanning electron microscopy (SEM) by a third -party 
laboratory to allow analysis of laser -tissue effects such as acute skin and pigment 
changes, wound healing response, or other morphologic changes.  
 
21. Risks and  Benefits  
 
21.1.  Potential  Risks  
The study treatments to be administered in this trial carry risks of local skin responses 
that are commo n, expected, and at times even desired with study treatments. The skin 
responses are typically only trace to moderate, and transient in nature, resolving within a 
few days after treatment.  
 
Common local skin responses or side effects of treatment include e rythema, edema, 
whitening, petechiae, pinpoint bleeding, purpura, crusting, blistering, and burning 
following the treatment.  
 
Examples of less common but potentially more severe or lingering local skin responses 
associated with PicoWay ™ laser treatment inc lude hyperpigmentation, 
hypopigmentation, herpes virus activation, infection and scarring.  
 
Allergic reactions to the topical or injectable anesthesia products are also possible.  
 
There is also a risk of eye injury associated with the use of any laser device. This risk is 
very uncommon as it is easily prevented if proper safety eyewear is used as required.  
 
21.2.  Potential  Benefits  
Subjects may benefit from participation in this study by experiencing partial or complete 
clearance of their benign pigmented les ions including dyschromia, or their wrinkles 
including fine lines. However, there is no guarantee that subjects will experience any 
beneficial clinical result at all.  
 
22. Adverse Device Effects  
 
22.1.  Definitions  
 
The following occurrences will be documented and re ported as required for compliance 
with applicable regulations including 21CFR 812 and ICH GCP EC(R2).  
 
Adverse Device Effect  
An adverse device effect (ADE) is an adverse event related to the use of an 
investigational medical device in a subject, whether it  is expected or unexpected.  
Unanticipated Adverse Device Effect  
An unanticipated adverse device effect (UADE) is any serious adverse effect on health or 
safety, any life -threatening problem or death caused by, or associated with a device, if  
   
 
IRB APPROVED_PWY18010_PROT_ V1.0 28NOV2018       Page 26 of 35  that effect, problem, or death was not previously identifi ed in nature, severity, or degree 
of incidence in the protocol; or any other unanticipated serious problem associated with a 
device that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects.  
 
22.2.  Reporting  
 
Anticipated device effects (ADE) and unanticipated adverse device effects (UADE) are 
collected from the time of subject consent until the subject exits the study. A description 
of the adverse event or device effect, date of onset, severity, action taken, relationship to 
study treatment and ou tcome are documented in the case report form. All adverse 
events or adverse device effects are followed until  resolution.  
 
The Investigator will submit to Candela and to the reviewing IRB a report of any 
unanticipated  adverse  device  effect  (UADE)  that might  have  led to a serious  adverse  event 
if suitable action had not been taken, intervention had not been made; or if circumstances 
had been less fortunate within 48 hours but in no event later than 10 working days after 
first learning of the  effect.  
 
The Sponsor, upon learning of any unanticipated adverse device effect, shall immediately 
conduct an evaluation and report the results to IRB within 10 working days.  
 
22.3.  Rating  
The Investigator will assess the severity and relationship of all adverse effects. The  
following definitions will be used for severity assessment:  
 
For all ADE and UADE reported, the Investigator will assign independent ratings for 
Severity and Relatedness to laser treatment in accordance with the descriptions found in 
Table 4 and Table 5, respectively.

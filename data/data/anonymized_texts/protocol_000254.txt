2  Background 
A woman's organs can shift position overtime as she ages or, in some cases, it can happen without any 
notice or warning.  Pregnancy, childbirth, genetic predisposition, menopause, prior pelvic surgery, 
connective tissue disorders, and factors associated with elevated intra-abdominal pressure such as 
obesity, chronic constipation, and excessive straining can stretch and weaken the muscles that support 
the pelvic organs.  A sheet of muscles, ligaments, and connective tissue called the pelvic floor supports 

Coloplast Corporation Confidential Investigation ID: CP009SU 
 
 
                          24 October 2011                Page 5 of 32 
 
 the uterus, small intestine, colon and bladder.  If pelvic floor muscles are weak, the organs may drop, 
protruding into the vagina causing a Pelvic Organ Prolapsed (POP).  
 
This condition affects millions of women and with the advancing age of the U.S. population, health care 
providers are likely to encounter women with pelvic organ prolapse with greater frequency.  A woman’s 
lifetime risk (up to the age of 80 years) for undergoing prolapse surgery has been estimated at 11 
percent1.  Approximately 200,000 inpatient procedures for prolapse are performed annually in the United 
States alone2.   
 
Pelvic organ prolapse can be categorized into four areas:  
 Cystocele or anterior prolapse:  When the vaginal wall weakens and allows the bladder to 
protrude into the vagina from above.  
 Vaginal vault or uterine prolapse:  When the top of the vagina loses its support and drops.  
 Rectocele or posterior prolapse:  When the back of the vagina weakens and allows the rectum to 
protrude into the vagina.  
 Enterocele:  When the small intestine drops and protrudes into the vagina.  This usually occurs in 
conjunction with one or more of the other types of prolapse listed above.  
 
Depending on the severity and stage of prolapse, many women do not need treatment.  Some women 
find that their symptoms are relieved through special pelvic muscle exercises call Kegel Exercises , which 
are used to strengthen the muscles that surround the opening of the urethra, vagina, and rectum.  Making 
dietary changes, maintaining a healthy weight, not smoking, and avoiding heavy lifting and straining also 
help to relieve symptoms.  Medication is available to help treat urinary and bowel symptoms of POP.  
Further, a device called a pessary can be inserted into the vagina to support the pelvic organs.  For 
women who can be fitted properly and whose pelvic organ support can be maintained with a pessary, this 
form of treatment has a high probability of success.

Coloplast’s Axis™ Allograft Dermis consists of , preserved human 
collagen.   
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
4  Study Purpose and Design 
This study is a prospective, single arm, multi-center, post-market study to evaluate the efficacy of Axis™ 
Allograft Dermis used for anterior, posterior or combined (anterior and posterior) pelvic organ prolaps e 
repair.  Target enrollment is 70-100  subjects enrolled at 5 to 10  investigational sites in the United States.  
 
5  Objectives 
5.1  Primary Objective 
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate efficacy of the Axis Dermis graft used for soft tissue 
repair, replacement, reconstruction, or augmentations in the correction of POP as assessed by POP-Q 
Stage improvement based upon an objective grading of prolapse of the anterior, posterior or combined 
anterior and posterior (assessed individually) compartment(s) compared between baseline and one year.  
Grading of the prolapse  will be categorized as follows: 
 Cured:  POP-Q Stage reduced to 0 or 1, or improved by 2 stages from baseline 
 Improved:  POP-Q Stage > 1, but improved by 1 stage from baseline 
 Failed:  POP-Q Stage stayed the same or increased in severity from baseline 
 
5.2  Secondary Objectives 
Secondary objectives will assess POP-Q Stage and patient satisfaction at 6 weeks, 6 months, 2 years , 
and 3 years post implant, as follows: 
 Change in prolapse stage from baseline as determined objectively by POP-Q prolapse 
grading at 6 weeks, 6 months, 2 year, and 3 year follow-ups . Change in patient satisfaction 
from baseline and quality of life measured through validated questionnaires (PDFI-20 and 
PFIQ-7)6 
 Change in patient sexual satisfaction from baseline measured through a validated 
questionnaire (PISQ-12)7

deviations must be documented on a Study Deviation Case Report Form. 
 
Reporting of protocol deviations should comply with local IRB policies and/or local laws.   
11  Adverse Events 
11.1 Adverse Event Definitions 
An Adverse Event (AE)  is any undesirable clinical occurrence in a participant regardless of whether or not 
it is related to the product or procedure.  Any pre-existing condition that exhibits a change in nature, 
severity, or degree of incidence is also considered an AE. 
 
A Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  is an Adverse Event that results in one or more of the following 
outcomes:  
 Life Threatening : The participant was at eminent risk of dying at the time of the adverse 
event.  
 Permanent Impairment : An adverse event that resulted in permanent impairment of a 
body function or permanent damage to a body structure.  
 Necessitates Intervention : An adverse event that resulted in a condition that necessitates 
medical or surgical intervention to preclude permanent impairment of a body function or 
damage to a body structure.  
 Hospitalization/Prolongs Hospitalization : Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongs an 
existing hospitalization. 
 Results in Death : An adverse event that results in the participant’s death.  
 
 
An Adverse Reaction  (AR) is a noxious and unintended response to any Hum an Cells, Tissues, and 
Cellular and Tissue-Based Products (HCT/Ps) for which there is a reasonable possibility that the HCT/P 
caused the response.

 11.2 Adverse Event Classification 
The investigator will be asked to assess the relationship of the event to the implanted product, the implant 
procedure, and the presence or performance of the tissue itself for each adverse event reported.  
 
A product related  adverse event is an Axis Dermis related adverse event that results from the presence or 
performance of the product.   
 
  
  
 
  
  
  
 
 
 
  
 
 
  
 
 
 
  
 
 
A procedure related  adverse event is an adverse event that occurs due to the implant procedure .  
Procedure related events can include, but are not limited to: 
 Adhesion 
 Anaesthesia reaction 
 De Novo dyspareunia 
 Fistula formation 
 Hematoma 
 Infection 
 Inflammation 
 Major nerve supply injury 
 Major vascular injury 
 Nerve injury or damage 
 Pain (lasting >6 weeks post-operatively) 
 Perforation (e.g. bladder, urethra, ureter, and bowel) 
 Urinary Retention directly related to the procedure and requiring surgical intervention 
and/ or prolonged catheterization lasting greater than 28 days  
 Voiding dysfunction not including urinary retention (e.g. Dysuria or obstruction) 
 Wound dehiscence 
 
11.3 Adverse Event Reporting Requirements 
Any mild, moderate, or severe adverse events possibly or probably related to the product and/or 
procedure, including Adverse Reactions, must be reported for purposes of this study protocol.    
 
Any Serious Adverse Events, including Adverse Reactions, possibly related to the product and/or 
procedure must be reported to the Sponsor within 10 working days.

11.4  Adverse Event Review 
An Independent Medical Advisor will review all Serious Adverse Events and Adverse Reactions on a 
periodic basis to be determined by nature and number of reported serious adverse events.  
12  Withdrawal / Study Exit 
In the event that a participant is unable or unwilling to continue participation in the study, notify Coloplast 
as soon as possible.   
 
If a participant expresses the desire to withdraw from the study, a Withdrawal / Study Exit Case Report 
Form must be completed.  The reason for participant withdrawal must be documented on this form.   
 
In the case that the participant fails to comply with the follow-up schedule, the study site must make 
multiple attempts to contact the participant (e.g. telephone, registered mail).  Each attempt to contact the 
participant must be documented in the participant’s records.  In the case that the participant is determined 
to be lost to follow-up, a Withdrawal / Study Exit Case Report Form must also be completed.   
 
Participants will be considered to have completed the study after their two year follow up visit has been 
completed and all outstanding adverse events have been resolved or are permanently ongoing.  
13  Electronic Case Report Forms (eCRFs) 
The eCRFs are designed to accommodate the specific features of the study design and will be used to 
capture study specific data and store in a secured FDA 21 CFR 11 compliant database.  Training will be 
provided for all study personnel entering data into the electronic database prior to being given access to 
the database.   
 
Sites will enter data on eCRFs using Electronic Data Capture (EDC).  All visit information will be captured 
in the EDC system.   
   
The data from the questionnaires will be entered by the site into the EDC system after 
completion. 
 
The investigator or relevant staff member who has signed the eCRF Authorization Log may complete the 
eCRF. The investigator will review all eCRFs for completeness and electronically sign the forms. 
14  Statistical Methods  
The key endpoints are specified below: 
 Efficacy :  Efficacy metrics will include objective POP-Q prolapse grading as well as patient 
satisfaction (as measured by subject questionnaires) post-operatively at  
 
 Safety :  Safety will be measured through procedural and product related adverse events.  
Procedural complications will be collected during hospitalization.  Serious product and procedure 
related events will be collected through 3 years post implant via the Adverse Event Form .

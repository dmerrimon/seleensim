28 February 2018  STUDY SUMMARY  
Title: A Phase 1 Study of BLU -285 in Patients with Gastrointestinal Stromal 
Tumors (GIST) and other Relapsed and Refractory Solid Tumors 
Study 
Centers  The study will be conducted at multiple study centers in the United State s (US), European Union (EU), and Asia. 
Introduction and Rationale: Gastrointestinal stromal tumors are the most common mesenchymal tumors occurring in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, representing approximately 0.1-3.0% of all GI malignancies. Approximat ely 90% of 
patients with GIST have a tumor that is dependent on a mutation in either v -Kit Hardy -Zuckerman 4 feline sarcoma viral oncogene 
homolog (KIT) (75-80%) or the highly related protein platelet- derived 
growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRα) (10-15%), most commonly a substitution of valine for aspartic acid at amin o acid 842 (D842V). On 
a molecular level, the most common sites for mutations in KIT at the time of diagnosis are exon 11 (60-70%) and exon 9 (5-15%), though exon 17 mutations are identified in approximately 1% of patients. Disease progression during treatment with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) is associated with new mutations in KIT, with an increasing prevalence of mutations in exon 17 to approximately 95-99% following second- line TKI therapy.  
No currently approved TKI selectively inhibits mutations in exon 17 of KIT or at PDGFRα D842. Thus, GIST dependent on either of these mutations represents an unmet medical need. Avapritinib (also known as BLU -285) has demonstrated potent and selective activity against 
KIT exon 17 and PDGFRα D842 mutants in vitro  and growth 
inhibition in TKI- resistant models in vivo . Avapritinib has been shown 
to be tolerable at active doses in toxicology and safety pharmacology studies. In the ongoing Phase 1 GIST trial, clinical activity was also observed in a broad range of KIT mutations beyond exon 17, such as exons 9, 11, 13, and 18. Given the poor prognosis and potential risk/benefit of avapritinib for patients with advanced GIST, further development of this agent is warranted. 
Number of 
Patients:  Approximately 235 patients will be enrolled in this study, including: 
•Approximately 50 patients in Part 1 (Dose Escalation)
•Approximately 185 patients in Part 2 (Expansion)
The total number of patients to be enrolled in Part 1 is dependent upon the observed safety profile, which will determine the number of patients per dose cohort, as well as the number of dose escalations required to achieve the maximum tolerated dose (MTD).

Design:  This is a Phase 1, open- label, first- in-human (FIH) dose- escalation 
study designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK, PD and preliminary antineoplastic activity of avapritinib, administered orally (PO), in adult patients with unresectable GIST or other relapsed or refractory solid tumo rs. 
The study consists of 2 parts: dose-escalation (Part 1) and expansion (Part  2). 
After provision of written informed consent, patients will be evaluated for study eligibility during the Screening period within 56 days (weeks) before study drug administration on Day -3 for patients participating in the PK lead -in stage (Part 1) or Cycle 1 Day  1 (C1D1) 
for patients not participating in the PK lead -in stage (Part 2).  
A treatment cycle is 28 days in duration. Patients in Part 1 (Dose -Escalation) will present to the study center on Day - 3 for the 
first dose of study drug and serial PK sampling, PD sample collection, vital sign measurement, ECG monitoring, safety monitoring and adverse event (AE) recording. The dose received on D - 3 will be the 
dose of the patient’s assigned cohort. On Days -2, -1, and 1 (24, 48, and 72 hours after study drug administration) patients will return for PK sampling and safety monitoring. Immediately after the 72 -hour PK 
sample is obtained, the C1D1 dose will be administered.  
Patien ts in Part 2 will present to the study center on C1D1 for the first 
dose of study drug and serial PK sampling (Groups 1 and 2), PD 
sample collection, vital sign measurement, ECG monitoring, safety monitoring and AE recording. Approximately 20 patients in Groups 1 and 2, at selected sites will participate in continuous ECG (Holter) monitoring for extraction of ECGs at the times of PK sampling; Holter recordings will be collected in Cycle 1 on Days 1, 2, and 15. 

Protocol BLU -285-1101 Amendment 8  Confidential  
Avapritinib  Page 16 of 110 
28 February 2018  During Cycle 1 (C1) following the PK Lead -in (P art 1), patients are to 
attend study center visits on C1D1 (Parts 1 and 2) Days 8, 15, and 22 
(Part 1), and Days 2 (Part 2, Groups 1 and 2) and 15 (Part 2). On C1D8 and C1D22, patients will undergo safety monitoring, on C1D15, safety monitoring and dense P K sampling (Part 1),
 and on Day 15 (Part  2) 
patients will undergo simplified safety monitoring, dense PK sampling  
(Groups 1 and 2), and sparse PK sampling (Group 3). 
During Cycle 2 (C2), all patients are to attend study center visits on Day 1 (D1) and Day 15 (Part 1), and on Day 1 only (Part 2) for safety monitoring and PK blood draws, and then on D1 of subsequent cycles. After C2, patients will return to the study center on Day 1 of each subsequent cycle to Cycle 13 for safety monitoring and (through Cycle  4 Day 1) PK blood draws. After C2 (C3D1) and every 2 cycles 
thereafter (e.g., C5D1, C7D1), patient’s tumor status will be assessed by computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) through Cycle  13. After 13 cycles have been completed on tri al, 
patients are to attend study center visits every 3 cycles on Day 1 for safety monitoring and a tumor status assessment (e.g., C16D1, C19D1, C22D1). This decreases the visit frequency and radiation exposure to  
the patient.  
It is anticipated that patients will receive at least 1 cycle of avapritinib; 
no maximum treatment duration has been set. After C1, patients may continue to receive avapritinib until precluded by toxicity, noncompliance, withdrawal of consent, physician decision, progressive disease, death, or closure of the study by the Sponsor. 
All patients will attend an EOT visit within 14 (±7) days after the last 
dose of study drug. A Safety Follow-up that may be performed by telephone contact for resolution of any residual AE will be made on Day 30 (+7 days) after the last dose of study drug, or at the time the patient initiates another antineoplastic therapy. Thereafter, patients are to be followed for disease assessment, subsequent antineoplastic therapy and survival approximately every 3 months until death, withdrawal of consent, or closure of the study by the Sponsor. 
Part 1 (Dose Escalation) The dose escalation part of the study will enroll patients with 
unresectable GIST or another advanced solid tumor. Patients with GIST must have disease th at has progressed following imatinib and at 
least 1 of the following: sunitinib, regorafenib, sorafenib, dasatinib, pazopanib or an experimental kinase-inhibitor, or disease with a D842 mutation in the PDGFRα gene. Patients with an advanced solid tumor other than GIST must have relapsed or refractory disease without an available effective therapy.

    The first cohort of patients will receive avapritinib at a starting dose of 
30 mg once daily (QD). The dose escalation increment for the first 
escalation step wil l be a maximum of 100%; however, if ≥  1 patient 
treated at the starting dose level has a ≥ Grade 2 non- hematologic AE 
or a ≥ Grade 3 hematologic AE and the AE (non- hematologic or 
hematologic) is not clearly attributable to a cause other than avapritinib, t hen the maximum dose escalation increment for the first 
escalation step will be 50%. All subsequent dose escalation increments will be a maximum of 50%.  
Three patients will be enrolled initially in each cohort and an additional 3 patients (for a total of 6) will be enrolled should the cohort require expansion due to dose- limiting toxicity (DLT). After the 
current escalation cohort is full, up to 3 additional patients, all of whom must have the diagnosis of GIST, may be enrolled into an enrichment cohort at  a lower dose that included only 3 patients 
evaluable for DLT, was reviewed at a dose-escalation meeting, and did not exceed the MTD. Data from these patients will allow for further exploration of PK, PD, and safety in patients with GIST. Enrollment of patients into an enrichment cohort requires written approval from the 
Sponsor. In cohorts in which the administered dose is < 100 mg QD, enrolled patients may have the diagnosis of either GIST or a relapsed/refractory solid tumor. In cohorts in which the admi nistered 
dose is ≥  100 mg QD, at least 2 patients in each cohort (4 if the cohort 
is expanded to 6 patients) must have the diagnosis of GIST. 
The specific dose for each subsequent cohort will be determined at a 
dose- escalation meeting that includes the Stu dy Investigators and the 
Sponsor Clinical Study Team, and must be agreed to by the Study Investigator at each study center and the Sponsor Clinical Study Team. Dose -escalation meetings will occur after all patients in the current 
cohort have completed at least 28 days of observation after their first dose of avapritinib, or have experienced a DLT. 
Dose escalation will continue until the MTD or a RP2D below the 
MTD has been determined. In addition, based on evaluation of the data, alternative dosing regimens  (e.g., twice daily [BID]) or schedules 
(e.g., 3 weeks on, 1- week rest) may be explored.  
Part 2 (Expansion) 
Once the MTD or RP2D has been determined, 3 groups of patients 
with the following characteristics will be enrolled and treated with avapritinib:  
• Group 1: Patients with unresectable GIST that has progressed 
following treatment with imatinib and at least 1 of the following: sunitinib, regorafenib, sorafenib, dasatinib, pazopanib, or an experimental kinase-inhibitor therapy and who do not have a D842V m utation in PDGFRα (N~100).  
Protocol BLU -285-1101 Amendment 8  Confidential  
Avapritinib  Page 18 of 110 
 
 
  28 February 2018  
   
    • Group 2: Patients with unresectable GIST harboring a D842V 
mutation in the PDGFRα gene (N~35) The PDGFRα mutation will 
be identified by local and central assessment, either in archival tissue or a new tumor biopsy obtained, prior to treatment with avapritinib . 
• Group 3: Patients with unresectable GIST that has progressed 
and/or those who have experienced intolerance following treatment 
with imatinib (including in the adjuvant setting) and who have not received additional kinase-inhibitor therapy and do not have a known D842V mutation in PDGFRα (N~50).  
Patients with GIST harboring a D842V mutation in the PDGFRα gene may be enrolled based on local mutation testing. However, during Part 2 of the study, Group 1 and 2 patients will be required to submit a 
formalin -fixed, paraffin -embedded tumor sample for PDGFRα 
mutational testing at a central laboratory prior to beginning treatment with avapritinib.  
During Part 2, patient safety will be reviewed on an ongoing basis at teleconferences (approximately every 1 - 2 months) that include the 
Study Investigators and the Sponsor Clinical Study Team. All safety data collected to date will be reviewed to confirm that no unexpected, significant, or unacceptable risk to patients enrolled in the study has been discovered. Available tumor response, PK, and PD data will also be reviewed.  
Duration of 
Treatment  It is anticipated that patients will receive at least 1 cycle of avapritinib; 
no maximum treatment duration has been set. After C1, patients may continue to receive avapritinib until precluded by toxicity, noncompliance, withdrawal of consent, physician decision, progressive disease, death, or closure of the study by the Sponsor. 
Duration of 
Patient Participation  The minimum duration of patient par ticipation is approximately 
3 months, including a screening period to assess study eligibility up to 8 weeks (56 days); a PK Lead -in stage (3 days) for all patients in Part 
1; a treatment period of at least 1 cycle (28 days); an EOT visit at least 14 (± 7) days following the last dose of study drug; and a Follow-up telephone contact for resolution of any AEs 30 (+7) days following the last dose of study drug or at the time the patient initiates another antineoplastic therapy. Thereafter, patients are to be followed for disease assessment, subsequent antineoplastic therapy and survival approximately every 3  months until death, withdrawal of consent or 
closure of the study by the Sponsor. 
Duration of Study The expected enrollment period is approximately 45 months and the expected duration of the study is approximately 60 months.

28 February 2018  1 INTRODUCTION AND RATIONALE  
1.1 Background  
Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor  
Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) are thought to develop from the interstitial cells 
of Cajal or their stem cell precursors. They are the most common mesenchymal tumors occurring in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, representing approximately 0.1% - 3.0% of all GI malignancies ( Miettinen et al,  2006; Rammohan et al, 2013). GIST is most commonly 
diagnosed between the ages of 50 and 80 years, with a slight predilection for males (Nilsson et al, 2005).  
GISTs may develop at any point along the GI tract, with the stomach (60%) and small intestine (30%) being the most common locations; the remaining 10% of GIST arise from the esophagus, colon, rectum, or the mesentery ( Nilsson et al, 2005). GIST most 
comm only presents with GI bleeding, with obstruction or acute tumor rupture occurring 
more rarely ( Rammohan et al, 2013). Slightly fewer than half of patients with GIST 
present with high- risk characteristics, such as large size, local infiltration, and/or 
metastasis ( Goettsch et al, 2005; Nilsson et al, 2005). GIST typically progresses by local 
extension from its site of origin, intra -peritoneal spread, and metastases to the hepatic 
parenchyma. Metastases to lymph nodes are rare.  
Surgery is the primary treatment for patients with resectable or potentially resectable GIST with the goal being to obtain histologically negative margins. GIST is not considered sensitive to either systemic cytotoxic chemotherapy or radiation therapy.  
Molecular Pathology of GIST 
Approximately 90% of patients with newly diagnosed GIST have a tumor that is 
dependent on a mutation in either V- kit Hardy -Zuckerman 4 feline sarcoma viral 
oncogene homolog (KIT) (75-80%) or the highly related protein platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRα) (10- 15%) (Antonescu et al, 2005; Barnett et al, 2012 ; 
Corless et al, 2005). A majority of mutations in PDGFRα occur at amino acid 842, with the most common mutation at this site being a substitution of valine for aspartic acid (D842V). The remaining cases, denoted as KIT and PDGFRα wild-type, are due to other abnormalities such as succinate dehydrogenase deficiency ( Nannini et al, 2013).  
KIT-mutated GIST  
On a molecular level, the most common sites for mutations in KIT at the time of diagnosis are exon 11 (60-70%) and exon 9 (5 -15%), though exon 17 mutations are 
identified in approximately 1% of patients ( Heinrich et al, 2008; Debiec- Rychter et al, 
2006) . Disease progression during treatment with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) is 
most commonly due to the emergency of resistance mutations in KIT, including an increasing prevalence of those in exon 17, which are refractory to standard first and second line therapy, imatinib and sunitinib. At the time of progression on first- line TKI 
Protocol BLU -285-1101 Amendment 8  Confidential

  28 February 2018  
   
    (imatinib) therapy approximately 20 -25% of patients had GIST harboring a mutation in 
exon 17; this increased to 95-99% following second- line TKI therapy ( Liegl et al, 2008; 
Wardelmann et al, 2006; Antonescu et al, 2005). No currently approved TKI selectively 
inhibits mutations in exon 17 of KIT.  
There are no agents approved to treat GIST after failure of regorafenib as no currentl y 
approved TKI selectively inhibits mutations in exon 17 of KIT, though other options, 
including sorafenib, nilotinib, dasatinib (for patients with the PDGFRα D824V mutation), and pazopanib are included in the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines based on limited data ( NCCN Soft Tissue Sarcoma Guidelines, 2015).  
Avapritinib (also known as BLU -285) has potent activity on the KIT activation loop 
mutants with biochemical half -maximal inhibitory concentration (IC
50) against all 
activation -loop mutants (exons 17 and 18) of less than 2 nM. In context of primary KIT 
exon 11 mutations, the avapritinib biochemical IC 50 against the predominant resistance 
mutation in exon 13 (V654A) is 11-nM. In addition, considerable avaprit inib activity 
below 30 nM is retained in combinations of exons 11 14 mutations. Due to its high selectivity, a vapritinib is well tolerated. Therefore, avapritinib can be dosed to cover a 
wide array of disease-relevant KIT mutants found in GIST patients. It is projected that the achieved RP2D of 300 mg avapritinib described in Section  1.4 will cover primary 
exon  11 mutants observed in imatinib-naïve GIST as well as combinations of exon 11 
with acquired resistance mutations in exo ns 13, 14, 17, or 18 in the post- imatinib setting. 
Pharmacokinetic data from the ongoing BLU-285-1101 Phase 1 dose escalation and expansion cohorts support these assumptions.  
Although imatinib is effective in many patients with GIST as first- line therapy,  many 
patients do not respond and subsequent lines of therapy for those who respond are 
significantly less effective. Therapeutic failure appears linked to acquired resistance mutations, particularly those involving the ATP binding pocket (exons 13 and 14) and activation loop (exons 17 and 18) of KIT. ( Heinrich MC et al, 2008). Post- imatinib, 
ATP -binding pocket mutations and activation-loop mutations occur at a rate of ~30% and 
~20%, respectively. Thirty- five percent of pati ents progress on imatinib without 
secondary mutations (mostly with KIT exon 9 mutations). The remainder of GIST patients who are unresponsive to imatinib harbor alterations in PDGFRα or SDH. In KIT-mutant GIST, the response rate for patients with tumors bearing ATP-binding pocket 
mutations to sunitinib is rather low (ORR 11%) and absent in activation -loop mutations 
(ORR 0%; Heinrich MC et al, 2008). Thus, patients failing imatinib due to either ATP -pocket or activation-loop mutations, represent an important medical need. The 
results observed thus far in this ongoing Phase 1 trial with avapritinib demonstrate important antitumor activity, including radiographic response with a disease- control rate 
of 56% based on central review (PR+SD) and prolonged PFS of 9.3 months in patients with heavily pretreated, KIT-mutant GIST. In this hea vily pretreated population, imatinib 
rechallenge has shown a median PFS of 1.8 months ( Kang et al, 2013 ). Based on these 
findings, an investigation of avapritinib, a potent and highly selective inhibitor of the post- imatinib mu tants found in GIST, is warranted. 
Protocol BLU -285-1101 Amendment 8  Confidential  
Avapritinib  Page 31 of 110 
28 February 2018  In the second- line GIST setting, sunitinib is the only approved TKI. A statistically 
significant improvement in PFS was demonstrated among patients treated with sunitinib 
compared with patients who received placebo (6.4 months vs 1.5 months; hazard ratio 0.33). No patients in either group had a complete response (CR) , while 14 of the 207 
patients in the sunitinib group and none of the 105 patients in the placebo group had a partial response (PR), giving ORRs of 6.8% and 0%, respectively. ( Goodman et al, 
2007). The benefit of sunitinib in the second- line setting is considered modest 
post-imatinib progression, and treatment is associated with various severe toxicities. The most common adverse events (AEs) related to sunitinib included diarrhea, mucositis, skin abnormalities, and altered taste. Severe hypertension and reductions in left ventricular ejection fraction were also more common in sunitinib -treated patients. Even though 
sunitinib may be potent against the wild -type KIT kinase compared to first- line therapy, 
resistance to sunitinib usually evolves within 1 year of treatment.   
PDGFRα -mutated GIST 
Gastrointestinal stromal tumors dependent on mutations in PDGFRα occur more frequently in the stomach, are more commonly resectable, have a somewhat more indolent clinical course than KIT-dependent GIST, and are less 2-deoxy-2-[fluorine-18]fluoro-D-glucose positron emission tomography (18FDG-PET) avid compared toGIST dependent on a mutation in KIT ( Matro , 2014). Despite the more indolent course
while localized, once metastatic, patients with GIST harboring the PDG FRα D842V
mutation have an extremely poor prognosis and respond poorly to imatinib and otherTKIs ( Cassier et al, 2012 ; Yoo  et al , 2015; Goodman et al, 2007; Heinrich et al, 2008).
In a retrospective study, Cassier et al identified 44 patients with PDGFRα -mutant GIST 
who had advanced disease from databases at 12 European institutions (N = 3,510 
genotyped GIST patients) and an additional 16 patients with advanced, PDGFR α-mutant 
GIST from the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) 
advanced GIST database (N = 465 genotyped GIST patients). Of 58 patients evaluable 
for efficacy post -imatinib, 32 patients (55%) had the PDGFR α D842V mutation and the 
remainder had mutations in PDGFR α Exon 4, 12, or 18 (non-D842V). The non-D842V 
patients had an overall response rate (ORR) of 36% with imatinib and median PFS > 1 
year. In contrast, patients with the D842V-mutation had no response (OR R = 0%). 
Median PFS with second- line treatment was short (2.1  months) and was not significantly 
different between imatinib, sunitinib, and other treatments. Similarly, in a small, 
retrospective Korean study (N = 18) PDGFR α-mutant GIST patients treated with  
imatinib reported a similar PDGFR α D842V prevalence (9/18; 50%) and poor outcome 
(median PFS 3.8 months and ORR 0% [0/5 evaluable patients]). Patients with the D842V 
substitution treated with sunitinib as second-line therapy reported median PFS 1.9 months and ORR 0% ( Yoo et al , 2015).

28 February 2018  As there are no approved agents that target PDGFRα D842 mutations, unresectable 
PDGFRα -driven GIST represents a high, unmet medical need. 
1.1.1  Preclinical Pharmacology 
BLU -285 was designed as a potent, selective, small molecule inhibitor of the KIT 
containing mutations in exon 17, and PDGFRα containing mutations at D842V, which mediate ligand independence. It has demonstrated biochemical in vitro activity on the KIT exon 17 mutant enzyme, KIT D816V (half- maxima l inhibitory concentration 
[IC
50 = 0.27 nM]) and the homologous mutant PDGFRα D842V (IC 50 = 0.24 nM). These 
mutations result in resistance to the TKI used to treat GIST: imatinib, sunitinib, and regorafenib (Table 1 ).

PDGFRα  = platelet -derived growth factor receptor alpha.  
The selectivity of BLU -285 was characterized across a panel of over 450  human kinases 
and disease-relevant kinase mutants. BLU-285 demonstrated the highest affinity for KIT exon 17 mutants (KIT D816V dissociation constant [K
d] = 0.3 nM; KIT D816H 
Kd = 0.6 nM), and also bound a small group of highly related class III receptor tyrosine 
kinases: KIT wild type (K d = 17 nM), PDGFRα wild type (K d = 1 nM), platelet -derived 
growth factor receptor beta wild type (K d = 1 nM), colony stimulating factor 1 receptor 
(Kd = 6 nM), and FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (K d = 25 nM). All other kinases 
demonstrated K d values greater than 50 nM. These data demonstrated that BLU-285 is 
selective for the KIT exon 17 mutant proteins specifically and has limited potential for activity outside of the related class III receptor tyrosine kinases ( Report BPM -0002).  
In vitro, BLU-285 was noted to inhibit the growth of the human mast cell leukemia cell line HMC1.2 (dependent on KIT D816V) and the mouse mastocytoma cell line P815 (dependent on the mouse homolog of the human KIT D816Y mutant). Additionally, BLU -285 inhibited signaling of the oncogenic and ligand -independent PDGFRα D842V 
when expressed in an engineered cell line, a model against which imatinib is inactive. In each of these model systems, BLU -285 demonstrated dose-dependent inhibition of KIT 
exon 17 or PDGFRα D842V as well as inhibition of key downstream effector pathways known to be involved in tumorigenesis.

28 February 2018  In vivo, anti- tumor efficacy of BLU -285 was demonstrated in a P815 mastocytoma 
xenograft and an imatinib- resistant mutant GIST patient- derived xenograft (PDX) tumor 
model, both of which are driven by exon 17 mutant KIT ( Figure  1). In the P815 model, 
robust antitumor activity was demonstrated in animals treated with doses (10 or 
30 mg/kg) of BLU -285 that were well tolerated, as noted by a lack  of impact on body 
weight.

Left panel : A dose -dependent decrease in tumo r growth was observed with PO, QD oral dosing of BLU -
285. 10 mg/kg and 30 mg/kg BLU -285 PO, QD dosing produced complete tumor growth inhibition with
several tumor regressions over the 10 -day dosing period. Due to the aggressive disease course, all vehicle-
treated mice were euthanized after 10 days of dosing due to disease- related moribundity. Statistica l

In the GIST PDX model, BLU-285 administered orally (PO) for 27 days resulted in 
antitumor activity sustained for 4 weeks after the completion of BLU-285 dosing, with demonstrated inhibition of both KIT activity and downstream signaling ( Figure 2 ).

28 February 2018  Figure 2: Efficacy of BLU -285 and Inhibition of KIT Exon 11/Exon 17 
Mutant Signaling in a GIST Patient -Derived Xenograft Model  
Abbreviations: Akt = v- akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog; ERK  = extracellular signal- regulated 
kinase; GIST  = gastrointestinal stromal tumor; KIT  = v- Kit Hardy -Zuckerman 4 feline sarcoma viral 
oncogene homolog; p = phosphorylated; PDX  = patient -derived xenograft; QD  = once daily.  
Mice bearing KIT exon 11/exon 17 mutant GIST PDXs were dosed once daily, orally with vehicle, 
30 mg/kg, or 100 mg/kg BLU -285 for 27 days.  
Left panel:  Tumor growth was measured twice weekly for the 27 -day dosing period followed by a 28- day 
observation period. BLU -285 induced tumor regression and sustained tumor growth inhibition at both 
doses tested. BLU -285 antitumor activity was highly statistically significant ( P < 0.0001 by one way 
analysis of variance). Data points represent group mean and error bars represent standard error of the mean 
for 9 mice per cohort.  
Right panel:  After 7 days of once -daily dosing with vehicle, 30  mg/kg BLU -285, or 100 mg/kg BLU -285, 
tumors were harvested from 3 mice per group, 24 hours after the last dose. Tumor homogenates demonstrated inhibition of KIT signaling b y analysis of KIT autophosphorylation and the downstream 
signaling markers p -ERK and p -AKT.  
Safety pharmacology studies revealed that BLU -285 inhibits the human ether-a- go-go 
related gene channel activity in vitro with an average IC 50 of 2.4 µM by single c ellular 
electrophysiologic recordings. BLU- 285 was further evaluated in a cardiovascular safety 
pharmacology study in conscious radiotelemetry-instrumented male Beagle dogs to 
assess the effects of electrocardiogram (ECG) intervals, as well as blood pressu re, body 
temperature, and respiratory parameters. Administration of BLU-285 at dose levels of 15, 30, or 45 mg/kg did not result in BLU-285- related effects on any cardiovascular 
parameter, including ECG waveform morphology, duration of time elapsed from the P wave to the R wave (PR), time elapsed from the Q/R wave to the end of the S wave (QRS), time between consecutive R waves, interval between the Q/R wave and T wave (QT), and QT interval corrected using van de Water’s formula intervals, body temperature,  or respiratory parameters.  
A Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) -compliant study performed to evaluate the effects of 
BLU -285 on the gross behavioral, physiological, and neurological state of female 
Sprague -Dawley rats (Irwin test) demonstrated, in a minority of animals, an increase in 
sensitivity to stimuli that are potentially underlying indicators of preconvulsive activity at the mid and high doses; no BLU- 285 related effects were noted at the lowest dose level 
tested. In a separate study performed in consci ous radiotelemetry -instrumented male 

Protocol BLU -285-1101 Amendment 8  Confidential  
Avapritinib  Page 35 of 110 
28 February 2018  Beagle dogs, no effects of BLU -285 were noted on any cardiovascular or respiratory 
parameter, or the clinical condition of the animals. 
1.1.2  Toxicology  
Sprague -Dawley rats and Beagle dogs were chosen as the nonclinical test species for 
assessing chemical structure- and pharmacology- mediated toxicity of BLU -285 on the 
basis of the following criteria: a) these species are pharmacologically responsive to the 
effects of BLU -285; b) these species have historically been used to ass ess potential 
human adverse effects, and; c) these species are qualitatively similar in hepatocyte metabolism profiles to humans.  
Good Laboratory Practice-compliant 28-day repeated dose toxicology studies were conducted in Sprague- Dawley rats. The cause of  morbidity and/or mortality was 
considered to be inanition and metabolic perturbations, as evidenced by body weight losses, decreased food consumption, serum and urine chemistry parameter alterations, and tissue effects. The severely toxic dose in 10% of a nimals (STD
10) was 30 mg/kg/day 
(180 mg/m2/day). Convulsions were occasionally observed at doses above the STD 10. 
Hematologic effects were observed, specifically depressed erythron, myeloid, and lymphoid parameters. Serum chemistry effects included increas es in total bilirubin (likely 
secondary to impaired bile acid transport), mild to moderate increases in liver enzymes (without microscopic evidence of hepatic toxicity), and altered parameters suggesting impaired metabolism such as total cholesterol and se rum cations. There were no 
morphologic brain alterations.  
An additional non- GLP -compliant study was conducted in female rats to determine if the 
oral administration of BLU -285 evokes changes in electroencephalographic (EEG) 
measures consistent with seizur es or altered seizure threshold. Administration of 
BLU -285 at 15 mg/kg or 30 mg/kg for 9 consecutive days did not result in a frank seizure 
or consistent pattern of EEG suggestive of lowered seizure threshold. Increased 
sensitivity to BLU -285 at 50 mg/kg was noted in two rats, one that developed sharp 
waves after the first day of dosing and another that had a frank seizure on the ninth day of dosing. 
In a 28- day GLP -compliant toxicology study in male Beagle dogs, the dose- limiting 
effects were inanition and  metabolic perturbations with vomiting, diarrhea, decreased 
food intake, body weight loss, hematologic and serum chemistry perturbations, and 
microscopic alterations in tissues. In addition, in the dog brain, a focal area of 
hemorrhage with vascular thrombus occurred at 30 mg/kg/day (reduced to 15 mg/kg/day) that may be associated with thrombocytosis and/or potential pharmacologic effects on the pericyte affecting vascular integrity. The highest non- severely toxic dose (HNSTD) was 
7.5 mg/kg/day (150 mg/m
2/day). The microscopic effects in the brain had no effect on 
clinical examinations; specifically, no neurologic effects were observed during in -life 
observations. All findings reversed after the 2-week recovery period, except those in the gonad (hypospermatogenesis) and brain.

28 February 2018  Subsequent 3-month GLP-compliant toxicology studies are currently ongoing in 
Sprague -Dawley rats and Beagle dogs to further characterize the dose- limiting toxicities 
(DLTs). Preliminary data are available from the study in dogs. At the high dose (30 mg/kg/day) tested in dogs, severe brain effects (including neurologic signs and brain 
and spinal cord hemorrhages) were noted in all animals. No neurologic signs or test-article related mortality occurred in dogs treated at the mid dose (15 m g/kg/day) or at 
the HNSTD (7.5 mg/kg/day). 
Additional information can be found in the Investigator’s Brochure (IB) for BLU-285. 
1.2 Study Rationale  
Targeting KIT exon 17 and PDGFRα D842 mutants with small molecule inhibitors has 
had limited success due to difficulties in creating potent molecules with sufficient selectivity; there are currently no approved agents that selectively target these mutant kinases. BLU -285 is a potent, selective, small molecule inhibitor of the 
ligand -independent KIT exon 17 and PDGFRα D842 mutants, significantly more potent 
against these targets than imatinib, sunitinib and regorafenib ( Table 1 ).  
BLU -285 has been shown to be tolerable at active doses in toxicology and safety 
pharmacology studies. Given the poor prognosis of patients with advanced GIST that has progressed after kinase- inhibitor therapy or that harbors a PDGFRα D842 mutation, 
along with the potential benefit/risk of BLU -285 in these patients, further development of 
this agent is warranted. The present clinical trial is a Phase 1, first -in-human (FIH) study 
of BLU -285 consisting of dose escalation (Part 1) and expansion (Part 2) parts. The 
objectives of Part 1 are to define the safety and tolerability of BLU-285, identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D), and to characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD), and prelim inary 
antineoplastic activity of BLU -285.  
Part 2 will begin once an MTD or RP2D has been determined in Part 1, and will permit a more complete assessment of safety, PK, PD, and antitumor activity in patients with GIST. Three groups of patients will be enr olled: 1) patients with GIST that has 
progressed following treatment with imatinib and at least 1 other kinase -inhibitor therapy 
(N~100); 2) patients with GIST harboring a D842V mutation in the PDGFRα gene, regardless of prior therapy (N~35); and 3) patients with GIST that has progressed and/or patients who experienced intolerance to imatinib and have not received additional kinase-inhibitor therapy (N~50). This will permit assessment of antitumor activity in each of these populations of treatment- refractor y GIST. Additionally, approximately 20 patients 
at selected sites will be evaluated with ECGs extracted from Holter monitoring to evaluate the effect of BLU -285 on ECG parameters in Groups 1 and 2. Analysis of 
safety, tolerability, PK, PD, and preliminary antitumor activity will help guide the future 
clinical development of BLU-285. In Part 2 of the study ORR, the primary measure of antitumor activity, will be evaluated for all patients, to determine if the observed ORR excludes a true ORR ≤ 10%, with 2- sided type I error of 0.05.

    This study will be conducted in compliance with the protocol, Good Clinical Practice 
(GCP), and the applicable regulatory requirements. 
1.3 Rationale for the Starting Dose and Dosing Regimen  
Selection of the safe starting dose in clinical trials for anticancer small molecules is based 
on either one- tenth the allometrically scaled STD 10 in the most sensitive species (female 
rat) based on the administered dose, or one- sixth the allometrically scaled HNSTD in the 
other species (dogs) if th ey cannot tolerate one- tenth of the allometrically scaled rat 
STD 10. The STD 10 in the female rat is 30 mg/kg/day or 180 mg/m2/day, one-tenth of 
which equals 18 mg/m2/day. The HNSTD in the dog is 7.5 mg/kg/day or 150 mg/m2/day, 
indicating that the dog can t olerate one -tenth of the rat STD 10. Therefore, the safe starting 
dose for this FIH Phase 1 trial will be 18 mg/m2/day, which equals a flat dose of 
30 mg/day based on a 1.7 m2 human body surface area. Based on a calculated elimination 
half-life of 22  hours, once daily (QD) dosing is appropriate. 
1.4 BLU- 285-1101 Study Update  
On 14 February  2017, the MTD for the BLU-285-1101 study was determined to be 
400 mg QD. Thirty -eight patients have initiated treatment in the dose expansion part 
(Part  2) of the study at 400 mg per day. However, based on a joint Investigator and 
Sponsor review of the available safety, PK, PD, and clinical activity data on 13 June 2017, a new starting dose of 300 mg QD was selected as the initiation dose of a vapritinib  
for the remainder of th e expansion part of the study. There was an option of dose 
escalation to 400 mg after 2  consecutive treatment cycles in adherence with Section 6.4.3, 
Dose Modifications, if a vapritinib  was well tolerated.  
As of 11 October 2017, a total of 116 patients were treated with avapritinib at starting doses of 30 to 600 mg, including 46 patients enrolled in Part 1, dose escalation, and 70 patients enrolled in Part 2, dose expansion. Thirty- seven (32%) patients had PDGFRα 
Exon 18 D842 mutation (34 D842V, 1 D842Y, 1 DI 842-843V, and 1 D842H845), 2 (2%) patients had PDGFRα Exon 14 N659K mutation, 76 (66%) had KIT mutations, and 1 patient was KIT and PDGFRα wild type.   
Response was assessed using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, version 1.1 modified for patients with GIST (mRECIST version 1.1) based on blinded central review 
of CT/MRI scans. Of the 31 PDGFR α D842 patients with ≥  1 radiographic assessment, 
1 (3%) patient had CR (pending confirmation), 21 (68%)  patients had PR (18 confirmed 
and 3 pending confirmation). The ORR was 71% (95% CI: 52% - 86%). The remaining 9 patients had stable disease (SD) as their best response, resulting in a disease con trol rate 
of 100% ( Table 2 ). Median duration of response (DOR) among PDGFR α D842 
responders had not been reached, the estimated 1 -year DOR rate was 65%. Of the 43 KIT 
patients with ≥  1 radiographic assessment, 6 (14%) patients had PR (5 confirmed and 1 
pending confirmation). The ORR was 14% (95% CI: 5% - 28%). Twenty- three (53%)

    had SD, resulting in a DCR of 67% ( Table 2 ). All 6 responders we re still on treatment at 
the time of the data cut off, with DOR ongoing and rang ing from 3 to 16 months.

Eighty -three of the 116 patients started at a dose level of 300 mg QD (RP2D , n=33) or 
400 mg QD (MTD, n=50), including 18 PDGFR α D842 patients, 1 PDGFR α Exon 14 
patient, and 64 KIT patients. Twelve of the 18 PDGFR α D842 patients had ≥  1 
radiographic assessment, 10 patients had PR, the ORR was 83%. Thirty of the KIT 
patients had ≥  1 radiographic assessment, 5 patients had PR, the ORR was 17%. Median 
PFS among the 64 KIT patients was 11.5 months (95% CI: 9.3 months – not estimable). 
The estimated 6 -month PFS rate was 69%.  
As of the 11 October 2017, 67 patients remained on treatment (31 PDGFR α patients and 
36 KIT patients). Forty-nine patients discontinued study treatment, including 6 patients due to adverse events, 40 patients due to disease progression, and 3 patients withdrew consent.

28 February 2018  4 STUDY PLAN  
4.1 Study Design 
This is a Phase 1, open-label, FIH dose- escalation study designed to evaluate the safety, 
tolerability, PK, PD and preliminary antineoplastic activity of BLU -285, administered PO 
in adult patients with unresectable GIST or other relapsed or refractory solid tumors. The 
study schematic is shown in Section 4.2. 
The study consists of 2 parts: dose-escalation part (Part 1) and expansion (Part 2).  
All study visits are inte nded to be conducted on an outpatient basis, but may be 
conducted on an inpatient basis as needed. After provision of written informed consent, 
patients will be evaluated for study eligibility during the Screening period within 56  days 
(8 weeks) before stu dy drug administration on Day- 3 for patients participating in Part 1 
or Cycle 1 Day  1 (C1D1) for patients participating in Part 2. 
A treatment cycle is 28 days in duration. In order to better evaluate the half- life of BLU -
285, which is predicted to be long, patients in Part 1 (Dose- Escalation) will participate in 
a 3-day PK -Lead in stage.  
In Part 1, patients will present to the study center on Day - 3 for the first dose of study 
drug and serial PK sampling, PD sample collection, vital sign measurement, ECG monitoring, safety monitoring and AE recording. The dose received on D- 3 will be the 
dose of the patient’s assigned cohort. Patients will return on days -2, -1, and 1 (24, 48, and 72 hours after study drug administration) for PK sampling and safety monitoring. Patients will not receive BLU -285 on Days - 2 and -1. Immediately after the 72 -hour PK 
sample is obtained, the C1D1 dose will be administered, and daily dosing will begin.  
Patients in Part 2 (Expansion) will present to the study center on C1D1 for the first dose 
of study drug and serial PK sampling (Groups 1 and 2), PD sample collection, vital sign measurement, ECG monitoring, safety monitoring and AE recording. Approximately 20 patients in Groups 1 and 2, at selected sites will participate in continuo us ECG 
(Holter) monitoring for extraction of ECGs at the times of PK sampling; Holter recordings will be collected in Cycle 1 on Days 1, 2, and 15. 
During Cycle 1 (C1), following the PK Lead-in (Part 1), patients are to attend study 
center visits on C1D1 (Parts 1 and 2), Days 8, 15, and 22 (Part 1), and Days 2 (Part 2, Groups 1 and 2) and 15 (Part 2). On C1D8 and C1D22, patients will undergo safety monitoring, and on C1D15 safety monitoring and dense PK sampling (Part 1). On Day 15 (Part 2), patients will u ndergo simplified safety monitoring, and dense PK sampling 
(Groups 1 and 2), and sparse PK sampling (Group 3).  
During Cycle 2 (C2), all patients are to attend study center visits on Day 1 (D1) and Day 15 (Part 1), and on Day 1 only (Part 2) for safety monitoring and PK blood draws, 
and then on D1 of subsequent cycles. After C2, patients will return to the study center on Day 1 of each subsequent cycle to Cycle 13 for safety monitoring and (through Cycle 4 
Protocol BLU -285-1101 Amendment 8  Confidential  
Avapritinib  Page 45 of 110 
28 February 2018  Day 1) PK blood draws. After C2 (C3D1) and every 2 c ycles thereafter, patient’s tumor 
status will be assessed by computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging 
(MRI) through Cycle 13. After 13 cycles have been completed on trial, patients are to attend study center visits every 3 cycles on Day 1 for safety monitoring and a tumor 
status assessment (e.g., C16D1, C19D1, C22D1). This decreases the visit frequency and radiation exposure to the patient.  
It is anticipated that patients will receive at least 1 cycle of BLU -285; no maximum 
treatment duration  has been set. After C1, patients may continue to receive BLU-285 
until precluded by toxicity, noncompliance, withdrawal of consent, physician decision, 
progressive disease, death, or closure of the study by the Sponsor. 
All patients will attend an EOT visit within 14 (±7)
 days after the last dose of study drug. 
A safety Follow -up (f/u) telephone contact for resolution of any residual AE will be made 
on Day 30 (+7 days) after the last dose of study drug, or at the time the patient initiates 
another antineoplastic therapy. Thereafter, patients are to be followed for disease assessment, subsequent antineoplastic therapy and survival approximately every 3 months until death, withdrawal of consent, or closure of the study by the Sponsor.  
The study visits are listed in the Schedule of Assessments and Schedules for PK sample 
collection and ECG monitoring ( Table 8, Table 9, and Table 10 ). 
Part 1 (Dose Escalation) 
The dose escalation part of the study will enroll patients with unresectable GIST or a relapsed or refractory solid tumor. Patients with GIST must have disease that has progressed following imatinib and at least 1 of the following: sunitinib, regorafenib, sorafenib, dasatinib, pazopanib or an experimental kinase-inhibitor agent, or disease with a D842 mutation in the PDGFRα gene. Patients with an advanced solid tumor other than GIST must have relapsed or refractory disease without an available effective therapy. A standard 3+3 dose-escalation design using cohorts of 3 patients will be employed.  
The first cohort of patients will receive BLU -285 at a starting dose of 30 mg QD. The 
dose escalation increment for the first escalation step will be a maximum of 100%; all 
subsequent dose escalation increments will be a maximum of 50%. 
Three patients will be enrolled initially in each cohort and an additional 3  patients (for a 
total of 6) will be enrolled should the cohort require expansion due to DLT. After the 
current escalation cohort is full, up to 3 additional patients, all of whom must have the 
diagnosis of GIST, may be enrolled into an enrichment cohort that included only 3 patients evaluable for DLT, was reviewed at a dose-escalation meeting, and did not exceed the MTD. Enrollment of patients into an enrichment cohort requires written approval from the Sponsor. Data from these patients will allow for further exploration of PK, PD, and safety in patients with GIST. 
In cohorts in which the administered dose is < 100 mg QD, enrolled patients may have 
the diagnosis of either GIST or a relapsed/refractory solid tumor. To assure that the safety 
Protocol BLU -285-1101 Amendment 8  Confidential  
Avapritinib  Page 46 of 110 
28 February 2018  profile of BLU -285 is adequately described in patients with GIST, at least 2 of 3 patients 
in each cohort (4 of 6 patients if  the cohort is expanded) dosed at ≥  100 mg QD must 
have the diagnosis of GIST. 
The specific dose for each subsequent cohort will be determined at a dose- escalation 
meeting by teleconference that includes the Study Investigators and the Sponsor’s study 
team  (including but not limited to the study physician and clinical study manager). The 
dose must be agreed to by the study investigator at each study center and the Sponsor Clinical Study Team. Dose -escalation meetings will occur after all patients in the cur rent 
cohort have completed at least 28 days of observation after their first dose of BLU-285, or have experienced a DLT. Patients enrolled into enrichment cohorts at lower dose levels need not have completed 28 days of observation for a dose- escalation meeting to 
occur.  
Dose escalation will continue until the MTD or a RP2D below the MTD has been 
determined. In addition, based on evaluation of the data, alternative dosing regimens (e.g., twice daily [BID]) or schedules (e.g., 3 weeks on, 1 week rest) may be explored. 
Additional details on the dose-escalation process, estimation of the MTD/RP2D, and 
DLTs are provided in Section 6.4. 
Expansion (Part 2) Once the MTD or RP2D has been determined, 3 groups of patients with the following 
characteristics will be enrolled and treated with BLU -285:  
•Group 1: Patients with unresectable GIST that has progressed following treatmentwith imatinib and at least 1 of the following: sunitinib, regorafenib, sorafenib,dasatinib, pazopanib, or an experimental kinase -inhibitor therapy and who do not
have a D842V mutation in PDGFRα (N~100).
•Group 2: Patients with unresectable GIST harboring a D842V mutation in thePDGFRα gene (N~35). The PDGFRα mutation will be identified by local and centralassessment , either in archival tissue or a new tumor biopsy obtained, prior to
treatment with BLU -285.
•Group 3: Patients with unresectable GIST that has progressed and/or those who haveexperienced intolerance following treatment with imatinib (including in the adju vant
setting) and who have not received additional kinase-inhibitor therapy and do nothave a known D842V mutation in PDGFRα (N~50).
Patient safety will be reviewed on an ongoing basis (approximately every 1 – 2 months) 
at a safety review meeting that incl udes the Study Investigators and the Sponsor Clinical 
Study Team. All safety data collected to date will be reviewed to confirm that no unexpected, significant, or unacceptable risks have been discovered. Available tumor response, PK, and PD data will also be reviewed.

5.1 Number of Patients  
Approximately 235 patients will be enrolled in this study, including: 
•Part 1 (Dose Escalation):
oApproximate ly 50 patients with unresectable GIST or other advanced solid
tumors.
•Part 2 (Expansion):oGroup 1: Approximately 100 patients with unresectable GIST that has progressed
following treatment with imatinib and at least 1 of the following: sunitinib,regorafe nib, sorafenib, dasatinib, pazopanib, or an experimental kinase- inhibitor
therapy and who do not have a known D842V mutation in PDGFRα.
oGroup 2: Approximately 35 patients with unresectable GIST harboring a D842Vmutation in the PDGFRα gene. The PDGFRα muta tion will be identified by local
and central assessment, either in archival tissue or a new tumor biopsy obtained,prior to treatment with BLU -285.
oGroup 3: Approximately 50 patients with unresectable GIST that has progressedand/or those who have experienced intolerance following treatment with imatinib(including in the adjuvant setting) and have not received additional kinase-inhibitor therapy and do not have a known D842V mutation in PDGFRα.
The total number of patients to be enrolled in Part 1 is dependent upon the observed safety profile, which will determine the number of patients per dose cohort, as well as the number of dose escalations required to identify the MTD, or a lower RP2D for further study in Part 2 if an MTD is not determined.

5.4 Patient Identification and Registration  
Patients who are candidates for enrollment into the study will be evaluated for eligibility by the Investigator to ensure that the inclusion and exclusion criteria (see Section 5.2 and Section 5.3) have been satisfied.  
During the dose-escalation part, upon identification of an eligible patient, study centers 
will submit a request to the Sponsor or designee to register each patient for enrollment. Enrollment will be granted based on availability in each dose-escalation cohort. Further instructions will be provided in the study manual. 
The Medical Monitor will confirm eligibility for all patients prior to receipt of the first 
dose of BLU-285. 
5.5 S tudy Completion  
Patients will be considered to have completed the study if they withdraw from the study 
for any of the criteria listed in Section 5.6. 
Protocol BLU -285-1101 Amendment 8  Confidential  
Avapritinib  Page 52 of 110 
28 February 2018  5.6 Patient Withdrawal Criteria  
Patients have the right to withdraw from the stu dy at any time for any reason.  
Patients may withdraw or be withdrawn from study treatments for any of the following 
reasons:  
•Withdrawal of consent.
•AE.
•Disease progression.
•Death.
•Investigator decision.
•Protocol deviation.
•Pregnancy.
•Lost to follow-up.
When a patient discontinues study drug or withdraws from the follow-up phase of the study, the primary reason(s) for discontinuation or withdrawal must be recorded in the appropriate sections of the electronic case report form (eCRF) and all efforts will be made to complete and report final study observations as thoroughly as possible. Following discontinuation of study drug, all efforts will be made to complete and report the protocol-defined study observations as completely as possible and to determine the reason for withdrawal.  
All AEs should be followed until resolution or for a period of 30 days from the last dose of study drug, whichever is shorter. If a patient withdraws from treatment because of an AE, every effort must be made to perform protocol- speci fied safety follow up procedures, 
as outlined in Section 7.6. 
In the event a patient is withdrawn from study drug or the follow-up phase of the study, 
the Medical Monitor must be informed. If there is a medical reason for withd rawal, the 
patient will remain under the supervision of the Investigator or designee until the condition has returned to baseline or stabilized. 
5.7 Replacement of Patients 
Part 1 : In order to be evaluable for DLT assessment, each patient in a cohort must have 
received at least 75% of their prescribed BLU -285 doses in C1 (i.e., ≥  21 doses) and 
completed follow-up safety evaluations through C1D28 or experienced a DLT. Patients 
Protocol BLU -285-1101 Amendment 8  Confidential  
Avapritinib  Page 53 of 110 
28 February 2018  not evaluable for DLT assessment will be replaced to ensure that data are available from 
3 or 6 evaluable patients (as required for that cohort) prior to the dose- escalation meeting. 
Part 2 : Patients may be added in order to have 100 antitumor assessment- evaluable 
patients in Group 1, 31 antitumor assessment-evaluable patients in Group 2, and 50 antitumor assessment- evaluable patients in G roup 3, as defined in Section  4.1. Safety 
data will be collected for all patients, whether or not they are evaluable for antitumor assessments.

28 February 2018  6 STUDY CONDUCT  
6.1 General Conduct  
The study will be conducted at multiple study center s in the United States (US), 
European Union (EU), and Asia. 
The schedule of assessments for the study is provided in Table 8, Table 9, Table 10  and 
Table 11 . 
The end of the study is defined as the time that the last patient completes his/her last visit, 
including assessments performed as a part of PSF follow-up, if the patient enters the PFS follow-up part of the study. See Table 8 for details of all study assessments.  
6.2 Early Study Termination 
The study may be terminated early at the discretion of the Sponsor, if there is sufficiently 
reasonable cause. In the event of  such action, written notification documenting the reason 
for study termination will be provided to each Investigator. 
Circumstances that may warrant early termination include, but are not limited to: 
•Determination of unexpected, significant, or unacceptable risk to patients.
•Failure to enter patients at an acceptable rate.
•Insufficient adherence to protocol requirements.
•Plans to modify, suspend, or discontinue the development of study drug.
•Other administrative reasons.
Should the study be terminated prem aturely, all study materials must be returned to the 
Sponsor or Sponsor’s designee. 
6.2.1  Rules for Early Termination of Enrollment in Dose Expansion  
To help ensure patient safety, the study incorporates an enrollment stopping rule that 
terminates further enroll ment in Part 2, Group 3 if there is an excess of permanent 
treatment discontinuations due to study drug- related AEs.  
After 10 patients in Group 3 of Part 2 have received at least 1 dose of BLU -285, the rate 
of permanent treatment discontinuations due to drug- related AEs will be assessed at least 
every 3 months. 
Adverse events meeting all of the following criteria will be included in the assessment: 
Protocol BLU -285-1101 Amendment 8  Confidential  
Avapritinib  Page 55 of 110 
28 February 2018  •The AE is considered drug-related and is the reason for permanent discontinuation of
treatment;
•The AE is Gra de ≥3 or meets the criteria for DLT (including events that meet the
criteria for DLT but occur after C1);
•The AE occurred after the first dose of study drug, but prior to initiation of asubsequent anticancer therapy;
•The AE occurred at a dose that does not exceed the MTD.
Further enrollment to Group 3 of Part 2 will be terminated if the lower bound of the 1-sided 70% exact binomial confidence interval of the discontinuation rate due to AE is>15%.
Table 4  below pr esents the operating characteristics for the early study termination 
assessment.

7 40 13.64%  No stop 
8 40 15.93%  Stop 
In addition, the study implements early stoppi ng rules that terminate enrollment due to 
lack of treatment effect in Group 3 of Part 2. Early stopping due to lack of treatment 
effect will be assessed using mRECIST version 1.1 response (CR+PR) rate. For Group 3 of Part 2, it is assumed that a true response rate ≥15% is clinically meaningful and that the probability of observing at least 2 responders among 20 patients is about 82%. If after 20 patients have had at least one post baseline mRECIST version 1.1 response assessment, ≥2  responders (including an unconfirmed response in a patient who remains 
on treatment) are observed, the study will continue to the full enrollment of 50 patients, otherwise enrollment will be discontinued due to lack of efficacy.

28 February 2018  6.3 Dose and Administration 
BLU -285 will be administere d PO, QD, in the morning, on D1 to 28 in 28- day cycles. In 
order to better evaluate the half -life of BLU -285, which is predicted to be long, patients 
in Part 1 (Dose Escalation) will participate in a 3 -day PK -Lead in stage. For patients in 
Part 1, a single dose of BLU-285 will also be administered on Day- 3 (the same dose as 
the patient’s assigned cohort dose). Patients will return on days -2, -1, and 1 (24, 48 and 
72 hours after study drug administration) for PK sampling, and will not receive BLU-285 on day s -2 and -1. Dosing will be continuous, with no inter-cycle rest periods. If 
warranted based on the emerging data, alternative dosing regimens (e.g., BID) or intermittent dosing (e.g., 3 weeks on, 1 week off) schedules may be explored. Patients will be dis pensed the appropriate number of Sponsor-packaged, labeled bottles on D1 of 
each cycle to allow dosing for 28 days; alternatively, patients may be dispensed the appropriate bottle(s) until the next scheduled visit. Patients must return all unused capsules (or the empty bottles) at each scheduled visit.  
BLU -285 doses should be administered with a glass of water (at least 8 ounces or 
250 mL) in a fasted state, with no food intake from 2 hours before until 1 hour after study drug administration. Each dose should be administered at approximately the same time each day. Patients should be instructed to swallow capsules whole and to not chew the capsules. Patients should be instructed to avoid proton pump inhibitors and H
2-receptor 
antagonists. Furthermore, antacids should not be taken within 3-4 hours before or after BLU -285 administration.   
On study day clinic visits, patients will take their dose of BLU -285 in the study clinic 
under observation. 
If the patient forgets to take their morning dose, he/she should t ake BLU -285 by 4 pm 
that day (the BLU -285 dose should be administered with a glass of water in a fasted state, 
with no food intake from 2 hours before until 1 hour after study drug administration). If 
the dose has not been taken by 4 pm, then that dose should be omitted and the patient should resume treatment with the next scheduled dose, the following morning. If a patient vomits during or after taking their BLU- 285, re -dosing is not permitted until the next 
scheduled dose. 
A temporary discontinuation (up to 2 weeks) in BLU-285 dosing is allowed for patients 
who require an interruption (e.g., for surgery or other procedure) during the treatment period. BLU-285 should be discontinued 48 hours before the procedure and resumed 48 hours after the procedure is completed.  
6.4 Guidelines for Dose Escalation  
Dose -escalation decisions will be made by the Study Investigators and Clinical Study 
Team.  
Protocol BLU -285-1101 Amendment 8  Confidential  
Avapritinib  Page 57 of 110 
28 February 2018  The dose escalation part of the study (Part 1) will enroll patients with GIST or a relapsed 
or refractory solid tumor. A 3+3 dose-escalation design using cohorts of 3 patients will be employed.  
The first cohort of patients will receive BLU -285 at a starting dose of 30 mg QD. The 
dose escalation increment for the first escalation step will be a maximum of 100%. However, if ≥  1 patient treated at the starting dose level has a ≥ Grade 2 non -hematologic 
AE or a ≥ Grade 3 hematologic AE and the AE (non-hematologic or hematologic) is not clearly attributable to a cause other than BLU -285, then the maximum dose escalation 
increment for the first escalation step will be 50%. All subsequent dose escalation increments will be a maximum of 50%.  
Three patients will be enrolled initially in each cohort and an additional 3 patients (for a total of 6) will be enrolled should the cohort require expansion due to a DLT. After the current escalation cohort is full, up to 3 additional patients, all of whom must have the diagnosis of GIST, may be enrolled into an enrichment cohort that included only 3 patients evaluable for DLT, was reviewed at a dose-escalation meeting, and did not exceed the MTD. Enrollment of patients into an enrichment cohort requires written approval from the Sponsor. Data from these patients will allow for further exploration of PK, PD, and safety in patients with GIST. Dose- limiting toxicities occurring in patients 
enrolled into enrichment cohorts will be included in the assessment of the MTD as described in Table 5 . 
If the second or third patients enrolled in the first cohort of the study are enrolled at a site in the UK, those patients may only be dosed if there is no safety concern at least 24 hours after the first patient was dosed.  
In cohorts in which the admini stered dose is < 100 mg QD, enrolled patients may have 
the diagnosis of either GIST or a relapsed/refractory solid tumor. To assure that the safety profile of BLU -285 is adequately described in patients with GIST, at least 2 of 3 patients 
in each cohort (4  of 6 patients if the cohort is expanded) dosed at ≥  100 mg QD must 
have the diagnosis of GIST. 
Dose escalation will continue until the MTD or a RP2D below the MTD has been 
determined. In addition, based on evaluation of the data, alternative dosing regimens (e.g., BID) or schedules (e.g., 3 weeks on, 1 week rest) may be explored. 
A summary of the dose- escalation scheme is presented Table 5  and Figure  3. Provisional 
dose- escalation levels are presented in Table 6 .

6.4.1  Intra -patient Dose Modification  
To minimize the number of patients treated at potentially inactive doses, intra -patient 
dose escalation may be permitted after a patient has completed ≥ 2 cycles of treatment 
without experiencing Grade ≥ 3 toxicity. The patient’s dose may then be escalated to a dose that has been reviewed at a dose- escalation meeting and does not exceed the MTD. 
Intra -patient dose escalation requires written approval from the Sponsor. 
6.4.2  Dose Limiting Toxicity  
Dose -limiting toxicity is defined as any treatment -emergent AE of Grade ≥ 3 occurring 
during C1 and not clearly attributable to a cause other than BLU-285, with the following exceptions:  
• Thrombocytopenia is a DLT only if it is Grade 4 and persists > 3 days or Grade 3 and associated with bleeding.  
• Neutropenia is a DLT only if it is Grade 4 and either persists > 3 days or is of any 
duration and requires growth factor support. 
• Anemia is a DLT only if it is Grade 4.  
• Lymphopenia is a DLT only if it is Grade 4 and persists > 7 days. 
• Nausea is a DLT only if it is Grade 3 and persists > 3 days despite therapy. 
• Vomiting is a DLT if it is Grade 4, or Grade 3 and persists > 3 days despite therapy. 
• Diarrhea is a DLT only if it is Grade 4, or Grade 3 and persists > 3 days despite 
therapy.  
• Total bilirubin Grade ≥ 2 is a DLT if associated with ALT ≥ Grade 2.  
• Infection is a DLT if it is Grade 4 or if it is Grade 3 and persist > 7 days.  
• Fever in the absence of neutropenia is a DLT if it is Grade 4 despite antipyretic therapy.

    • Abnormalities of serum calcium, magnesium, and phosphate are DLTs only if they 
are Grade 4, or Grade 3 and the patient is clinically symptomatic, requires hospitalization, or if the specific abnormality is not able to be corrected to Grade ≤ 2 within 3 days. 
• Fatigue is a DLT only if it is Grade 3 and persists > 7 days.  
• Other clinically important AEs that do not meet the specified DLT criteria may be considered to be a DLT upon review at a Dose- escalation meeting.  
6.4.3  Dose Modifications  
BLU -285 will be administered PO at a starting dose of 300 mg QD in continuous 28- day 
cycles. If the treating investigator considers it to be in the patient’s best medical interest. the dose may be increased to 400 mg QD under the following circumstances:  
• The patient has received two or  more cycles of BLU -285 without any treatment-
related AEs ≥  Grade 3 (unless the AE has resolved to Grade 1 or less), and 
without any cognitive , mood or intracranial bleeding  AEs ≥  Grade 2 (regardless 
of resolution), and there is evidence of tumor increase. 
• The patient has received four or more cycles of BLU -285 without any treatment-
related AEs ≥  Grade 3 (unless the AE has resolved to Grade 1 or less), and 
without any cognitive , mood or intracranial bleeding AEs ≥  Grade 2 (regardless 
of resolution), and the patient has not had a PR or CR. 
Dose reduction guidelines for BLU-285- related toxicity are summarized  in Table 7 . 
These guidelines for dose reductions should be followed by clinical investigators; however, for an individual patient, dose interruptions, reductions, and treatment discontinuation should also be based on clinical circumstances. Adverse events should be graded according to NCI CTCAE, v4.03. Deviation from these guidelines must be documented and communicated with the Sponsor. 
It is recommended that patients with hematologic AEs (neutropenia, thrombocytopenia 
and anemia) of Grade 4 be evaluated at least twice -weekly and those with 
non-hematologic toxicity of Grade 3 or worse be evaluated at least once- week ly until 
resolution of the AE(s). 
A maximum of 3 dose reductions are permitted; no dose reductions are permitted below 
the 100 mg daily dose level. 
In case of dose re- escalation due to resistance or loss of response, the Sponsor must be 
contacted and must provide written approval for the patient to continue on treatment and 
to be escalated to the next dose level.

Toxicity  Modification  
General 
Grade 1 or Grade 2  • No d ose modification required  
Grade 3 or Grade 4 
of any duration • Hold until event is Grade 2 or less, or has returned to baseline, and then resume by reducing the dose by 100 mg less than the current dose  
• If the patient is already receiving a dose of 100 mg Q D, and continued

Grade 1, other than 
mild impairment  • Interrupt dosing for 7 days, and resume dosing without dose reduction.  
• The dosing interruption may be repeated if the impairment continues to 
worsen after resuming dosing; however, rep eated dosing interruption is not 
required, and should be balanced with the need to treat the underlying GIST  
Grade 2  • Interrupt dosing for a minimum of 7 days  
• Resume dosing with a dose reduction of 100 mg when the cognitive effect has improved to Grade 1 or less, or while still at Grade 2, if continued treatment is 
considered in the best interest of the patient due to the underlying GIST  
• If the patient is already receiving a dose of 100 mg QD, and continued 
treatment is considered in the best interest of the patient due to the underlying 
GIST, treatment may be resumed at 100 mg   
Grade 3 -4 • Interrupt dosing for a minimum of 14 days  
• Resume dosing with a dose reduction of 100 mg when the cognitive effect has improved to Grade 1 or less, or when it has improved to Grade 2, if continued treatment is considered in the best interest of the patient due to the underlying GIST  
• If the patient is already receiving a dose of 100 mg QD, and continued treatment is considered in the best interest of the patient due to the underlying GIST, treatment may be resumed at 100 mg, after the cognitive effect has improved to Grade 2 or less

6.4.4  Maximum Tolerated Dose 
The MTD is defined as the highest dose level at which ≤ 1 patient experiences DLTs in 
C1 during Part 1 of the study. At least 6 patients must be treated at this dose in order to determine that it is the MTD.  
6.4.5  Recommended Phase 2 Dose  
The RP2D will not exceed the MTD and will be determined at a dose- escalation meeting 
during Part 1 of the study. Additionally, observations related to PK, PD, and any cumulative toxicity observed after multiple cycles may be included in the rationale supporting the RP2D below the MTD. If an MTD is not identified, then PK, PD, and safety data, along with pertinent non- clinical data suggestive of a dose -effect relationship, 
will be used to define a RP2D. Six patients must be treated at this dose in order to confirm that it is the RP2D.  
6.4.6  Alternate Dosing Schedule  
Alternate dosing schedules, such as BID and intermittent dosing may be evaluated if supported by PK, PD, safety, or efficacy data. A decision to change the treatment schedule, including the choice of a starting dose for the new schedule, will only occur after agreement has been reached among the study Investigators at each study center and the Sponsor Clinical Study Team; should any of these people not have attended the meeting, approval will be obtained in writing. The protocol will be amended prior to evaluating new dosing schedules.

    6.5 Prior and Concomitant Therapy  
All medications administered and pr ocedures within 28 days of the first dose of study 
drug should be recorded on the eCRF. In addition, all prior treatments for the underlying 
malignancy should be recorded. 
6.5.1  Prohibited Concomitant Therapy  
• In vitro studies with recombinant human CYP enzymes demonstrated that BLU -285 
phase I metabolism is predominantly mediated by CYP3A4, with CYP2C9 playing a 
minor role. Therefore, concomitant treatment with drugs that are strong CYP3A4 inhibitors or strong CYP3A4 inducers is prohibited (refer to Appendix 2 for a list of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers). 
• Any investigational agent or device other than BLU-285. 
• Any antineoplastic agent other than study drug. 
• Neutrophil growth factor support is prohibited within 14 days prior to the first dose of 
study drug and throughout C1, unless the patient experiences a DLT of neutropenia. 
Radiation therapy to target lesions or surgical removal of target lesions is considered 
indicative of progressive disease.  
6.5.2  Concomitant Therapy  to be used with Caution 
In vitro, BLU-285 is a reversible inhibitor of CYP2C8, CYPC9, and CYP3A4/5 at clinically relevant concentrations ([I]/Ki >  0.1). BLU-285 also has demonstrated 
time-dependent inhibition of CYP3A4/5 in vitro with an estimated K
inact and K I of 
0.0301 min-1 and 12.3 μM, respectively. Therefore, clinical drug -drug interactions with 
comedications for which CYP2C8, CYP2C9, or CYP3A- mediated metabolism 
constitutes the primary mechanism of clearance is likely. In vitro, BLU-285, at concentrations of 0.3 to 3 μM, induced CYP3A4 mRNA expression with a maximal 3.25- fold induction observed at 3 μM. 
In vitro, BLU-285 is an inhibitor of P-glycoprotein (P- gp), breast cancer resistance 
protein (BCRP), bile salt export pump (BSEP), and multidrug and toxin extrusion protein (MATE1, MATE2K). Therefore, BLU -285 may have the potential to increase plasma 
concentrations of co-administered substrates of these transporters. Medications that are CYP2C9, CYP3A4, or BCRP substrates with a narrow therapeutic index should be used with c aution (refer to Appendix 3 for a list of these medications).  
Investigators should ensure patients avoid proton pump inhibitors and H
2-receptor 
antagonist during the dose escalation part of the study. Furthermore, antacids should be taken at a time point that is not proximal to study drug administration (at least 3 -4 hours 
before or after study drug administration).  
Protocol BLU -285-1101 Amendment 8  Confidential  
Avapritinib  Page 64 of 110 
 
 
  28 February 2018  
   
    In addition, medications that are known to increase the risk of seizures should be used 
with caution . 
6.5.3  Permitted Concomitant Therapy  
Medications and treatments other than those specified in Section 6.5.1 and Section  6.5.2, 
including palliative and supportive care for disease- related symptoms are permitted 
during the study.  
Patients should be closely monitored, and treatment is to be instituted for disease- related 
symptoms as appropriate. Supportive care measures for treating AEs should be instituted 
as soon as they are recognized.  
Antiemetic treatments may be used at the Investigator’s discretion and in accordance with the American Society of Clinical Oncology guidelines or equivalent after documented nausea or vomiting has occurred without medications having been used. The choice of anti-emetic tre atment, if required, will be made at the Investigator’s discretion. During 
Part 1 of the study prophylaxis for nausea or vomiting may be instituted beginning on C2D1 in patients who experience these toxicities during C1, and during C1 for patients who experienced a DLT of nausea or vomiting. During Part 2 of the study, prophylaxis for nausea and vomiting may be instituted at the Investigator’s discretion. Anti- diarrhea 
medications may also be used at the Investigator’s discretion. 
6.6 Additional Precautions  
The light absorption characteristics of BLU -285 suggest the possibility the BLU-285 
treatment will be associated with phototoxicity. Therefore, patients should use clothing 
and sunscreen to avoid direct sun exposure.

    Note: Every effort should be made to keep the schedule of assessments on time for each patient.  
a On days when study drug is to be administered in the clinic, all tests or procedures must be completed pre -dose at each study visit unless otherwise indicated. 
Additional safety tests (e.g., hematology, ECG) may be performed whenever c linically indicated, at the Investigator’s discretion. Whenever a test result is 
questionable, it should be repeated immediately.  
b The PK lead -in stage will occur during Part 1.  
c If an alternate treatment is to be started within 14 days after the last study drug dose, the EOT visit should be conducted prior to the first dose of alternate 
therapy. End -of-treatment procedures do not need to be repeated if they were completed within 7 days (or within 28 days for disease response assessments).  
d After compl eting the Safety Follow -up, patients are to be followed every 3 months (±14 days) until death, withdrawal of consent, or closure of the study by 
the Sponsor.  
e Screening will occur from D -59 through D -4 for patients in Part 1 and from D -56 through D -1 for patients in Part 2.  
f Only Part 1. These visits are not required for patients enrolled in Part 2 of the study.  
g The 30 -day Safety Follow -up may be performed by phone.  
h In the event that a patient requires a delay up to 14 days (e.g., for toxicity), this visit can be delayed for up to 14 days.  
i A complete medical history will be obtained at the Screening visit, including a history of GIST and/or other malignancies, pr ior treatments, response to each 
treatment (if available), and concurrent illnesses.  
j A complete physical examination including weight, height, evaluation of the skin, head and neck, lymph nodes, heart, lungs, bre asts, abdomen, pelvis (if 
indicated based on symptoms), musculoskeletal system, neurologic system, and a basic assessment of mental  status and mood will be performed at the 
Screening visit. Subsequent physical examinations will focus on weight, signs of the GIST (or relapsed or refractory solid tu mor), changes from previous 
physical examinations, neurologic, mental status, and mood ex aminations, and AEs.  Complete physical examinations should be completed by all patients on 
Day 1 of each cycle through and including Cycle 13. After Cycle 13, physical examinations will be performed  every 3 cycles  (C16 D1, C19 D1, etc.) , and at 
EOT.  
k Only P art 1; these values will be considered “Baseline” and do not need to be repeated on D1.  
l Only Part 2 Group 1 and 2 patients.  
m Vital signs include temperature, pulse, and systolic/diastolic blood pressure.  Vital signs should be completed by all patients o n Day 1 of each cycle through 
and including Cycle 13. After Cycle 13, vital signs will be performed  every 3 cycles  (C16 D1, C19 D1, etc.) , and at EOT.  
n To be performed for women of child- bearing potential. Baseline is to be obtained within 7 days of the first dose of study drug (D - 3 for patients in Part 1; 
C1D1 for patients in Part 2) and on D1 of every odd numbered cycle (e.g., C3, C5)  through and including Cycle 13. After Cycle 13, pregnancy test will  be 
performed  every 3 cycles  (C16 D1, C19 D1, etc.) , and  at EOT. For Belgium and Poland only, pregnancy test will be performed  on D1 of every cycle.  
o Hematology parameters to be measured include Hgb, white blood cell (WBC) with differential count, and platelet count. On days  when safety ECGs are to be 
obtaine d in the clinic, the ECG will be acquired within 2 hours prior to the collection of the blood sample.  Hematology testing should be completed by all 
patients on Day 1 of every cycle through and including Cycle 13. After Cycle 13, hematology testing will be completed  every 3 cycles  (C16 D1, C19 D1, etc.) , 
and at EOT.  
p Baseline (D -3 for patients in Part 1; C1D1 for patients in Part 2) safety laboratory tests and samples for PD markers are to be obtained within 7 days before 
the first study drug dose. Should Scr eening tests occur within 7 days of D -3 (Part 1) or C1D1 (Part 2), they do not need to be repeated.  
q Only Part 1. These assessments are not required for patients enrolled in Part 2.  
r Coagulation studies include international normalized ratio (INR) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT). If they are within the normal range through C3D1 then they can be discontinued and obtained only as clinically indicated.

will take their dose of BLU -285 under observation at the study clinic after the pre- dose (trough) PK sample has been obtained.  
u PK sampling will be performed as specifi ed in Table  9 (Part 1), Table 10 , and Table 11 (Part 2). Additionally, Investigators may obtain blood samples for PK 
analysis at the time(s) that significant drug- related AEs and SAEs occur.  
v Plasma samples for biomarkers are drawn at baseline, C1D15, C2D1, C3D1, every odd cycle post C3 until and including C11 and EOT for Groups  1 and 2 
(Part  2). Plasma samples for biomarkers are drawn at baseline,  C2D1, C3D1, every odd cycle post C3 until and including C11 and EOT for Group 3 (Part 2). 
See Table 12  for further details regarding schedule of PD sample acquisition.  
w Archival or new tumor biopsy samples required for Part 2 Group 1 and 2 patients. Archival or new tumor biopsy samples optional for Part 2 Group 3 patients. For further details refer to Table 12 . 
x Disease response assessment (per mRECIST version 1.1) will b e based on local assessments of computed tomography (CT) / magnetic resonance imaging 
(MRI) scans. Computed tomography with intravenous (IV) contrast of the chest and CT or MRI with IV contrast of the abdomen an d pelvis will be performed 
at Screening. Imag ing of body regions containing sites of disease (target or non- target) will be repeated in all patients on C3D1 and then after every 2 cycles 
through and including Cycle 13. After Cycle 13, tumor assessment will be performed  every 3 cycles  (C16D1, C19D1, e tc), and at EOT. If a patient is not 
tolerant of IV contrast, non -contrast scans may be performed. For each patient, the same method of tumor imaging used at baseline should be used throughout 
the study.

    7 DESCRIPTION OF STUDY  PROCEDURES  
7.1 Screening 
Following informed consent, all patients will participate in screening procedures to 
determine eligibility within 56 days (8 weeks) prior to dosing on D - 3 (for pa tients 
participating in the PK lead -in stage [Part 1]) or C1D1 (for patients not participating in 
the PK lead -in stage [Part 2]).  
During Part 2 of the study, all patients must submit a formalin -fixed, paraffin -embedded 
tumor sample for PDGFRα mutational te sting at a central laboratory prior to beginning 
treatment with BLU -285. The tumor sample may be archival or from a new tumor biopsy. 
The tumor sample should be submitted as two tissue blocks (preferred) or as 20 unstained slides. Additional details on the sample requirements are described in the laboratory manual. The tumor samples may be submitted under the Tissue Screening ICF, before the Study ICF has been completed, or it may be submitted under the Study ICF. 
The following procedures will also be performed at the Screening visit: 
• Obtain Informed Consent 
• Obtain demographic data, including gender, date of birth/age, race, and ethnicity; 
• Complete medical history, including a history of GIST and other malignancies, prior 
treatments, response to each treatment (if available), and concurrent illnesses.  
• Obtain list of concomitant medications  
• Complete physical examination, including height, weight, evaluation of the skin, head 
and neck, lymph nodes, heart, lungs, breasts, abdomen, pelvis (if indicated based on symptoms), musculoskeletal system, neurologic system, and a basic assessment of mental status and mood. 
• ECOG PS  
• Obtain tumor samples (mandatory for Part 2, Group 1 and 2 patients only) and send for central laboratory assessment as described above, and in Section  7.4.2. 
• Tumor imaging: CT with intravenous (IV) contrast of the chest; MRI with IV contrast or CT with IV contrast of the abdomen and pelvis. If a patient is not tolerant of IV contrast, non- contrast scans may be performed.

    7.2.5  Clinical Laboratory Tests  
Clinical laboratory evaluations will be performed at the local laboratory. Prior to starting 
the study, the Investigator will provide the Sponsor (or its designee) copi es of all 
laboratory certifications and normal ranges for all laboratory parameters to be performed by that laboratory. 
Clinical laboratory evaluations will be conducted at the time points outlined in Table 8. 
In addition, all clinically significant laboratory abnormalities noted on testing will be 
followed by repeat testing and further investigated according to the judgment of the Investigator.  
The following safety laboratory parameters are to be evaluated by the Investigator: 
Hematology
a: Hgb, white blood cell with percent differential count, platelet 
count  
Coagulationa,b: International normalized ratio and activated partial 
thromboplastin time  
Serum chemistrya: Sodium, potassium, blood urea nitrogen or urea, bi carbonate 
(venous), creatinine, calcium, chloride, magnesium, 
phosphorus, albumin, AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase, total 
bilirubin (direct bilirubin if total bilirubin is >  ULN)  
Urinalysis (dipstick):  pH, specific gravity, bilirubin, blood, glucose, ketones, 
leukocyte esterase, nitrite, protein, urobilinogen  
Serum pregnancyc: β-hCG  
a On days when study drug is to be administered in the clinic, blood must be drawn prior to study drug 
administration.  
b If coagulation tests are within the normal range through C3D1, then beginning in C4 they can be 
discontinued and obtained only a s clinically indicated.  
c For women of childbearing potential only, as defined in Section 9.6. 
7.2.6  Imaging of the Brain  
Imaging of the brain by CT scan or MRI will be performed at screening, C2D1, C3D1 
and C4D1, as outlined in Table 8. 
7.2.7  Adverse Events and Concomitant Medications  
Each patient must be carefully monitored for the development of any AEs throughout the 
study from the start of study drug administration (or from the time of signing informed consent, for SAEs that are assessed as possibl y or probably related to study related 
procedures) to 30 days after the last dose. In addition, SAEs that are assessed as possibly or probably related to study treatment that occur 30 days post- treatment are also to be 
reported. 
Protocol BLU -285-1101 Amendment 8  Confidential

   28 February 2018  
   
    Complete details on AE and SAE monitoring are provided in Section 9 and Section 10. 
Concomitant medications will be record ed from the time of signing informed consent to 
30 days after the last dose.  
7.3 Pharmacokinetic Assessment  
Serial blood samples will be collected at the time points outlined in Table 9 (Part  1) and 
Table 10  (Part 2, Groups 1 and 2) to determine systemic concentrations of BLU-285, 
including metabolites when relevant. Sparse blood samples will be collected at the time 
points outlined in Ta ble 11 (Part 2, Group 3). Additionally, Investigators may obtain 
blood samples for PK analysis at the time(s) that significant drug -related AEs and SAEs 
occur.  
When the timing of a blood sample coincides with the timing of an ECG measurement or extraction , the ECG will be completed within 1 hour prior to the collection of the blood 
sample.  
The timing of blood samples drawn for BLU-285 concentration determination may be changed if the emerging data indicates that an alternate sampling scheme is needed for better characterization of the BLU -285 PK profile. Moreover, the total number of 
samples may be decreased if the initial sampling scheme is considered unnecessarily intensive. Should the number of required samples increase, the protocol and informed consent form will be amended. 
7.4 Pharmacodynamic / Biomarker Assessment  
7.4.1  Blood Samples for Pharmacodynamic / Biomarker Assessment  
Blood samples will be collected at the time points outlined in Table 12  to characterize the 
mutant allele fraction in plasma ctDNA of KIT or PDGFRα at baseline and during 
treatment with BLU -285, and to measure changes from baseline in the levels of KIT, 
PDGFRα, and other cancer -relevant mutant allele fractions.  
The timing of blood samples drawn for PD/biomarker assessments may be changed based 
on emerging data. Should the number of required samples increase, a protocol amendment and updated informed consent form will be created and distributed. 
Additional details will be provided in a laboratory manual.  
7.4.2  Tumor Samples for Biomarker Assessment  
To meet the secondary objectives, tumor tissue will be obtained at the time points 
detailed in Table 12. During Part 2, tumor mutation analysis of an archival tumor sample or new tumor bi opsy will be performed by a central laboratory, and a sample must be 
submitted for PDGFRα D842V testing prior to initiating treatment with BLU -285 for 
Group 1 and 2 patients only.  
Protocol BLU -285-1101 Amendment 8  Confidential  
Avapritinib  Page 76 of 110 
 
 
   28 February 2018  
   
    For new biopsies, efforts should be made to obtain biopsies from progressin g lesions. If a 
new tumor biopsy is obtained, it should be by core needle biopsy according to local 
institutional practices and fixed in formalin. If feasible, tumor biopsies will also be obtained at the EOT in patients who discontinue for progression, ideally from progressive lesions. 
In addition to the screening central laboratory testing for PDGFRα D842V, tumor tissue 
will be analyzed centrally for assessment of KIT, PDGFRα and other cancer relevant mutations in a retrospective manner.  
Additional exploratory biomarker research may be performed using the plasma sample 
for exploratory biomarkers, as well as residual tumor tissue samples and material derived from these samples in view of developing new genetic and mechanistic biomarkers to assess the effects of BLU -285 in patients with c ancer.  
Additional details will be provided in a laboratory manual.

7.5 Disease Response Assessment  
Investigator- assessed disease response in patients with GIST according to mRECIST 
version 1.1 for GIST will be based on local MRI or CT scans perfor med at the time 
Protocol BLU -285-1101 Amendment 8  Confidential  
Avapritinib  Page 77 of 110 
28 February 2018  points outlined in Table 8. Computed tomography with IV contrast of the chest, and CT 
or MRI with IV contrast of the abdomen and pelvis will be performed at screening. At subsequent time points all body regions that contained sites of disease (target or non-target) at screening will be imaged. If a patient is not tolerant of IV contrast, 
non-contrast CT or MRI may be performed. For each patient, the same method of tumor imaging used at baseline shoul d be used throughout the study. 
Magnetic resonance imaging and CT scans will be reviewed locally at the study center, ideally by the same individual for each patient at each time point. Magnetic resonance imaging and CT scans will also be collected and reviewed centrally to provide a central assessment of response and progression.  
7.6 End- of-treatment, Safety Follow -up, and PFS Follow -up 
All patients will attend an EOT visit 14 (±7)  days after the last dose of study drug (see 
Table 8 for a list of EOT assessments). If an alternate treatment is started within 14 days 
of the last dose of study drug, the EOT visit should be conducted prior to the first dose of alternate therapy. End -of-treatment procedures do not need to be repeated if they were 
completed within 7 days (or within 28 days for disease response [imaging] assessments). 
A Safety Follow -up telephone contact to inquire about resolution of any residual AE(s) 
will be made 30 (+7) days after the last dose of study dr ug, or at the time the patient 
initiates another antineoplastic therapy for GIST or solid tumor. Thereafter, patients will 
be followed approximately every 3 months until death, withdrawal of consent or closure of the study by the Sponsor. 
7.7 Sample Processing , Storage, and Shipment  
Instructions for the processing, storage, and shipment of all study samples for central 
analysis will be provided in a separate study manual.  
Samples will be stored until analysis and remaining samples and/or tissue may be retained until 10 years after the completion of the study, or until the research is discontinued, whichever occurs first.

    8 STUDY DRUG MANAGEMENT 
8.1 Description  
8.1.1  Formulation 
BLU -285 will be administered as a drug in capsule formulation or an immediate release 
tablet for oral administration. The drug substance and drug product are manufactured and 
formulated following current Good Manufacturing Practices.  
Each BLU -285 hard-gelatin capsule contains 5 mg (size 4 dark green opaque), 10 mg 
(size 3 white opaque), 30 mg (size  2 gray opaque), or 100 mg (size 1 light blue opaque) 
of the active drug substance.  
Each BLU -285 tablet is blended with compendial excipients. The formulation blend is 
roller compacted, compressed into white round tablets and aesthetically film coated. 
BLU -285 tablets are prepared as 100 mg in strength.   
All study drugs are for investigational use only and should only be used within the context of this study. 
8.1.2  Storage  
BLU -285 capsules and tablets must be stored at room temperature in their original 
container,  according to the package label.  
All study drug products must be stored in a secure, limited -access location and may be 
dispensed only by the Investigator or by a member of the staff specifically authorized by 
the Investigator.  
8.2 Packaging and Shipment  
BLU -285 capsules and tablets will be supplied in to the study center packaged in 60 cc 
Wide Mouth Round high-density polyethylene bottles. Each bottle will be induction-sealed and capped with a 33 mm child- resistant closure.  
Packaging will meet all regulatory r equirements.  
8.3 Accountability  
Accountability for the study drug at the study site is the responsibility of the Investigator. The Investigator will ensure that the study drug is used only in accordance with this protocol. Where allowed, the Investigator may choose to assign drug accountability responsibilities to a pharmacist or other appropriate individual. 
The Investigator or delegate will maintain accurate drug accountability records indicating 
the drug’s delivery date to the site, inventory at the site, use by each patient, and return to 
Protocol BLU -285-1101 Amendment 8  Confidential  
Avapritinib  Page 79 of 110 
 
 
   28 February 2018  
   
    the Sponsor or its designee (or disposal of the drug, if approved by the Sponsor). These 
records will adequately document that the patients were provided the doses as specified in the protocol and should reconcile all study drug received from the Sponsor. Accountability records will include dates, quantities, batch/serial numbers, expiration dates (if applicable), and patient numbers. The Sponsor or its designee will review drug accountability at the site on an ongoing basis during monitoring visits. 
Study drug must not be used for any purpose other than the present study. Study drug that 
has been dispensed to a patient and returned unused must not be re-dispensed to a different patient.  
Patients will receive instructions for  home administration of BLU-285. 
All study drug that is either unused or dispensed and returned should be retained at the site until it is inventoried by the study monitor. All used, unused, or expired study drug will be returned to the Sponsor or its designee, or if authorized, disposed of at the study site per the site’s Standard Operating Procedures and documented. All material containing BLU -285 will be treated and disposed of as hazardous waste in accordance 
with governing regulations. 
8.4 Compliance  
Patie nts will be dispensed the appropriate number of study drug bottles to allow for 
dosing for a full cycle, or until the next scheduled visit. Patients are to return all unused 
capsules and tablets (or the empty bottles) on D1 of each treatment cycle or at the next scheduled visit. Compliance with the dosing regimen will be assessed based on return of unused drug (or empty bottles).

    9 ADVERSE EVENTS 
Monitoring of AEs will be conducted throughout the study. Adverse events will be 
recorded in the eCRF from the tim e of first study drug dose through 30 days after the last 
dose of study drug. SAEs and serious pretreatment events (see Section 10) will be recorded in the eCRF from the time of signing informed consent through 30 days after the last dose of study drug. In addition, SAEs that are assessed as possibly or probably related to study treatment that occur > 30 days post- treatment will also be reported. All 
AEs should be monitored until they are resolved or are clearly determined to be due to a patient’s stable or chronic condition or intercurrent illness(es). 
9.1 Definitions  
9.1.1  Definition of Adverse Event  
An AE  is any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, 
whether or not considered drug relate d. An AE (also referred to as an adverse experience) 
can be any unfavorable and unintended sign (e.g., an abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, without any judgment about causality. An AE can arise from any use of the drug (e.g., off-label use, use in combination with another drug) and from any route of administration, formulation, or dose, including an overdose. Overdose includes only clinically symptomatic doses that are at least twice the intended  dose.  
An abnormal laboratory value will not be assessed as an AE unless that value leads to discontinuation or delay in treatment, dose modification, therapeutic intervention, or is considered by the Investigator to be clinically significant.  
In general,  disease progression should not be reported as an AE (or an SAE), or cause of 
death in this study. Instead the AEs (or SAEs) considered as complications of disease progression should be reported. However, if no specific complications of disease progression can be identified that explain the clinical observations, “disease progression” may be reported as an AE, SAE or cause of death.  
9.1.2  Suspected Adverse Reaction  
A suspected adverse reaction is any treatment -emergent AE that is not clearly attributable 
to a cause other than BLU-285. 9.1.3  Unexpected Adverse Event  
An unexpected AE is one for which the nature or severity of the event is not consistent 
with the applicable product information, e.g., the IB. 
Protocol BLU -285-1101 Amendment 8  Confidential  
Avapritinib  Page 81 of 110 
 
 
   28 February 2018  
   
    9.2 Documenting Adverse Events  
Each patient must be carefully monito red for the development of any AEs. This 
information should be obtained in the form of non-leading questions (e.g., “How are you 
feeling?”) and from signs and symptoms detected during each examination, observations of study personnel, and spontaneous repor ts from patients.  
All AEs (serious and non-serious) spontaneously reported by the patient and/or in response to an open question from study personnel or revealed by observation, physical examination, or other diagnostic procedures will be recorded in the appropriate section of the eCRF. Any clinically significant value in laboratory assessments or other clinical findings is considered an AE and must be recorded on the appropriate pages of the eCRF. A laboratory value may also be considered an AE when it qua lifies as a SAE, when it 
requires medical intervention, or when it affects dosing with study drug. When possible, signs and symptoms indicating a common underlying pathology should be noted as one comprehensive event.  
9.3 Assessment of Intensity  
Intensity of a ll AEs, including clinically significant treatment-emergent laboratory 
abnormalities, will be graded according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 4.03. Adverse events not listed in the CTC AE will be graded as follows: 
• Grade 1: Mild, the event is noticeable to the patient but does not interfere with routine activity.  
• Grade 2: Moderate, the event interferes with routine activity but responds to symptomatic therapy or rest.  
• Grade 3: Severe, th e event significantly limits the patient’s ability to perform routine 
activities despite symptomatic therapy.  
• Grade 4: Life-threatening, an event in which the patient was at risk of death at the time of the event.  
• Grade 5: Fatal, an event that results in t he death of the patient.

   28 February 2018  
   
    9.4 Assessment of Causality  
Relationship to study drug administration will be determined by the Investigator 
according to the following criteria:  
• Not Related: Exposure to the study treatment did not occur, or the occurrence of the AE is not reasonably related in time, or the AE is considered unlikely to be related to 
the study treatment.  
• Possibly Related: The study treatment and the AE were reasonably related in time, and the AE could be explained equally well by causes other than exposure to the study treatment.  
• Probably Related: The study treatment and the AE were reasonably related in time, and the AE was more likely explained by exposure to the study treatment than by other causes, or the study treatment was the most likely cause of the AE.  
9.5 Pretreatment Events  
A pretreatment event is any untoward occurrence in a patient who has signed informed consent to participate in a study but before administration of any study drug. It does not necessarily have a causal relationship with study participation. A serious pretreatment event meets the criterion of a pretreatment event and satisfies any of the 6 criteria specified for an SAE as described in Section 10. 
9.6 Pregnancy Reporting  
Pregnancy is neither  an AE nor an SAE, unless a complication relating to the pregnancy 
occurs (e.g., spontaneous abortion, which may qualify as an SAE). 
Pregnancies and suspected pregnancies (including a positive pregnancy test regardless of 
age or disease state) of a female patient or partner of a male patient occurring while the patient is on study drug, or within 30 days of the patient’s last dose of study drug, are considered immediately reportable events. If a female partner of a male patient taking investigational produc t becomes pregnant, the male patient taking BLU -285 should notify 
the Investigator, and the pregnant female partner should be advised to call her healthcare provider immediately. In pregnant female patients, study drug is to be discontinued immediately and  the patient instructed to return any unused BLU-285 to the Investigator. 
The pregnancy, suspected pregnancy, or positive pregnancy test must be reported immediately using the Pregnancy Report Form. The Investigator must follow up and document the course and outcome of all pregnancies even if the patient was discontinued from the study or if the study has finished. The female patient or partner of a male patient should receive any necessary counseling regarding the risks of continuing the pregnancy and the possible effects on the fetus. Monitoring should continue until conclusion of the pregnancy.

Avapritinib  Page 83 of 110 
 
 
   28 February 2018  
   
    All outcomes of pregnancy must be reported by the Investigator to the Sponsor or 
Medical Monitor on a Pregnancy Outcome Report form within 30 days after he/she has gained knowledge of the delivery or elective abortion.  
Any SAE that occurs during pregnancy must be recorded on the SAE report form (e.g., 
maternal serious complications, spontaneous or therapeutic abortion, ectopic pregnancy, stillbirth, neonatal death,  congenital anomaly, or birth defect) and reported within 
24 hours in accordance with the procedure for reporting SAEs. 
9.6.1  Contraception Requirements  
Women of childbearing potential must agree to use a highly effective method of 
contraception ( Clinical Tria l Facilitation Group, 2014) throughout the study drug 
administration period until at least 30  days after the last dose of BLU-285. Women are 
considered to be of childbearing potential following menarche and until becoming post-menopausal (defined as no menses for at least 12 months without an alternative medical cause) unless permanently sterile. A high follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the postmenopausal range may be used to confirm a post-menopaus al state in women not 
using hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement therapy. However, in the absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, a single FSH measurement is insufficient. Permanent sterilization methods include hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy and bilateral 
oophorectomy ( Clinical Trial Facilitation Group, 2014 ). Because BLU -285 is a potential 
CYP3A4 inducer, women should use hormonal contraception with caution and supplement with other highly effective methods.  
Men with partners who are women of reproductive potential must agree that they will use 
condoms and their partners will use highly effective contraceptive methods throughout the study drug administration period until at least 90 days afte r the last dose of BLU -285. 
Highly effective forms of contraception are defined as the following ( Clinical Trial 
Facilitation Group, 2014):  
• Combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contrace ptives that 
inhibit ovulation, including oral, intravaginal and transdermal products. 
• Progestogen -only hormonal contraceptives that inhibit ovulation, including oral, 
injectable and implanted products.  
• Intrauterine devices (IUD) and intrauterine hormone-r eleasing system (IUS).  
• Bilateral tubal occlusion (women).  
• Male partner vasectomy or other method of surgical sterilization provided that the 
partner is the sole sexual partner of the trial participant and the vasectomized 
partner has received medical assessment of surgical success.  
Protocol BLU -285-1101 Amendment 8  Confidential  
Avapritinib  Page 84 of 110 
 
 
   28 February 2018  
   
    • Sexual abstinence (men and women), when this is the preferred and usual lifestyle 
of the patient. Periodic abstinence (such as a calendar, symptothermal and post- ovulation methods, withdrawal (coitus interruptus), and the lac tational 
amenorrhea method are not acceptable methods of contraception.  
The following methods of contraception are not considered highly effective ( Clinical 
Trials Facilitation Group , 2014):  
• Progestogen -only oral hormonal contraception that do not inhibit ovulation.  
• Barrier methods with or without spermicide, or spermicide alone. 
9.6.2  Gamete and Embryo Banking  
Hypospermatogenesis was observed in the testis and epididymis of rats and dogs and did not recover aft er 2-week recovery. Patients should be informed of the possibility of 
gamete and embryo banking.

    10 SERIOUS ADVERSE EVEN T 
10.1 Definition of Serious Adverse Event  
An SAE is any event that meets any of the following criteria:  
• Death.  
• Life-threatening.  
An AE is life threatening if the patient was at immediate risk of death from the event 
as it occurred; i.e., it does not include a reaction that if it had occurred in a more serious form might have caused death. For example, drug-induced hepatitis that resolved without evidence of hepatic failure would not be considered life threatening even though drug induced hepatitis can be fatal. 
• Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization. 
Adverse events requiring hospitalization should be considered SAEs. Hospitalization 
for elective surgery or routine clinical procedures that are not the result of AE (e.g., elective surgery for a pre -existing condition that has not worsened) need not be 
considered AEs or SAEs. If anything untoward is reported during the procedure, that occurrence must be reported as an AE, either 'serious' or 'non-serious' according to the usual criteria.  
In general, hospitalization signifies that the patient has been detained (usually involving at least an overnight stay) at the hospital or emergency ward for observation and/or treatment that would not have been appropriate in the physician's 
office or outpatient setting. When in doubt as to whether 'hospitalization' occurred or 
was necessary, the AE should be considered serious. 
• Persisten t or significant disability/incapacity.  
An AE is incapacitating or disabling if the experience results in a substantial and/or permanent disruption of the patient's ability to carry out normal life functions. 
• Congenital anomaly/birth defect in the offsprin g of a subject who received BLU -285. 
• Other: Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or 
require hospitalization, may be considered an SAE when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or 
Protocol BLU -285-1101 Amendment 8  Confidential

28 February 2018  surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. 
Examples of such events are:  
oIntensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm.
oBlood abnormalities or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization.
oDevelopment of drug dependency or drug abuse.
10.
2 Reporting Serious Adverse E vents 
All SAEs or serious pretreatment events that occur during the course of the study must be 
promptly reported by the Investigator to Chilter n International. Deaths and AEs as sessed 
as lif e-threatening ar e to be reported i mmediately and  SAEs t hat m eet ot her cr i teri a are to 
be reported within 24 hours from the point in time when the Investigator becomes aware 
of the SAE. All SAEs must be reporte d whether or not they are considered causally 
related t o BLU -285. Serious AE forms will be completed and the information collected 
will include patient number, a narrative description of the event, a nd an assessment by the 
Investigator  as to the severity o f the event and relatedness to study drug. Follow-up 
information on the SAE may be requested by the Sponsor or Medical Monitor. 
 
 
 
  
 
 
If the re are serious, une xpected adv erse drug r eactions  associated w ith the use of 
BLU -285, the Sponsor will notify the appropriate regulatory agency(ies) and all 
participating Investigators on an expedited basis. The local Institutional Review Board 
(IRB)/Independent Ethics C ommittee ( IEC) w ill be pr omptly not ified b ased on loc a l 
regulations where required by the IRB/IEC of all serious, unexpected adverse drug 
reactions involving risk to human patients. 
All AEs, whether serious or not, will be describe d in the source documents and in the 
appropriate section of the eCRF. All new events, as well as those that worsen in intensity 
or frequency relative to baseline, which occur after signing the informed consent through 
30 days following the last dose of study drug, m ust be  recorded.  Advers e events t hat ar e 
ong
oing at the time of treatment discontinuation should be followed through the 30-day 
follow up assessment. Serious AEs felt by the Investigator to be related to BLU-285, 
however, must be reported any time the Investigator  becom es aware of s uch an eve nt, 
even if this occurrence is more than 30 days after the last dose of study drug. 
Information to be reported in the description of each AE includes:

28 February 2018  11 STATISTICS  
11.1 General Procedures  
Continuous variables will be summarized using descriptive statistics (n, mean, standard 
deviation, median, minimum, and maximum).  
Categorical variables will be summarized showing the number and percentage (n, %) of patients within each classification. Appropriate confidence intervals will also be presented. Time to event data will be summarized using Kaplan -Meier methods, which 
will include the estimated median with 95% CIs and 25
th and 75th percentiles.  
Safety, efficacy, PK, and PD evaluations will be assessed in the appropriate populations. These data will be summarized descriptively by dose level, dose groups, and overall as appropriate. Statistical hypothesis testing will be applied to the analysis of ORR in patients with starting dose of 300 or 400 mg QD (RP2D and MTD, respectively) in the following groups of patients: patients with PDGFRα D842V mutation, patients with no PDGFRα D842V mutation in second  line treatment, and patients with no PDGFRα 
D842V mutation in 3+ line treatment.  
The primary analysis for patients with PDGFRα D842V and patients with no PDGFRα D842V mutation in 3+ line treatment will occur after the number of patients specified in the sample size calculations for each  group have enrolled and had the opportunity for 
8 months of treatment or have ended treatment earlier. A clinical study report will be written using this analysis. The final database lock will occur after all patients enrolled in Part 2 have had an opportunity for 8 months of treatment or have ended treatment earlier. A clinical study report addendum will be written to include the primary efficacy analysis for patients with no PDGFRα D842V mutation in second  line treatment and update 
clinical study report analyses with further follow up data from all patients.  
All data will be provided in by -patient listings.  
A separate Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) will be finalized prior to locking the database. 
11.2 Analysis Populations  
The following analysis populations will be used for presentation of the data: 
•Safety Population: The safety population includes all patients who have received at
least 1 dose of study drug . Patients will be analyzed based on the dose they receive.
The safety population will be the primary population for efficacy and safety analysisunless otherwise specified.
•Dose Determining (DD) Population: The DD population includes all patients in Part 1who have received at least 75% of their prescribed doses (i.e., ≥  21 doses) of the
study drug in C1 and completed follow-up through C1D28 or experienced a DLTregardless of extent of study drug exposure. The DD population will be the default
Protocol BLU -285-1101 Amendment 8  Confidential  
Avapritinib  Page 89 of 110 
28 February 2018  analysis population for the dose escalation phase for all MTD related analyses. 
Patients will be analyzed according  to the dose they receive.  
•Response- Evaluable (RE)  Population: The RE population includes all patients in the
safety population who have at least 1 target lesion per mRECIST version 1.1, atbaseline, have at least 1 postbaseline disease assessment by centr al radiology per
mRECIST v ersion 1.1, and have experienced no major protocol violations. Subjects
will be analyzed according to the dose they receive. Selected efficacy analyses maybe performed using the RE population.
Within each of the safety, DD, and RE populations, selected analyses may be conducted based on subpopulations such as  PDGFRα D842V, PDGFRα Exon 18, PDGFRα, and 
non- PDGFRα D842V.  
•PK Population: The PK population includes patients who have sufficient plasmaconcentration -time data to reliably estimate the PK parameters of BLU -285.
•ECG Population: The ECG population includes patients who undergo continuousHolter monitoring and have sufficient ECG tracings so that the QT interval correctedfor heart rate (QTc) parameter can be evaluated.
11.3 Sample Size  
The total number of patients to be enrolled in the Part 1 is dependent upon the observed safety profile, which will determine the number of patients per dose cohort, as well as the number of dose escalations required to achieve the MTD or identify the RP2D. It is expected that approximately 50 patients who meet the criteria for t he DD Population will 
be enrolled in Part 1.  
Sample size calculation for Part 2 takes into consideration patients treated at the RP2Ds 
in Part 1.  
For patients with PDGFRα D842V mutation, a sample size of 31 patients will allow 
testing the null hypothesis  of ORR ≤  10% versus the alternative hypothesis of ORR ≥ 
35% using Fisher’s exact test with 90% power assuming a 2- sided type I error rate of 
0.05. 
For patients with no PDGFRα D842V mutation in second  line treatment, a sample size of 
50 patients will allow  testing the null hypothesis of ORR ≤  10% versus the alternative 
hypothesis of ORR ≥ 25% using Fisher’s exact test with 83% power assuming a 2-sided 
type I error rate of 0.05. 
For patients with no PDGFRα D842V mutation in 3+ line treatment, a sample size of 
100 patients will allow testing the null hypothesis of ORR ≤ 5% versus the alternative hypothesis of ORR ≥ 15% using Fisher’s exact test with 90% power assuming a 2-sided type I error rate of 0.05.

28 February 2018  11.4 Procedures for Handling Missing, Unused, and Spurious Da ta 
No imputation will be performed for missing data elements. Dates that are partially 
missing or impossible will be imputed using the method described in the SAP. 
11.5 Statistical Methods  
11.5.1  Disposition  
A tabulation of the disposition of patients will be presented, including the number 
enrolled, the number treated, and the reasons for study discontinuation. Entry criteria and protocol deviations will be listed.  
11.5.2  Demographic and Baseline Characteristics 
Demographic and baseline disease characteristic data will be su mmarized descriptively.  
11.5.3  Exposure Analysis  
A summary of study drug exposure, including number of doses administered, total dose, duration of treatment, dose intensity, and the proportion of patients with dose modifications will be produced. 
11.5.4  Primary Endpoint (s) 
Parts 1 and 2:  
Safety evaluations will be based on the incidence, severity, and type of AEs, and changes 
in the patient’s vital signs, clinical laboratory results, and ECG findings. Summarization will focus on incidence of any SAEs, AEs, drug- related AEs, and AEs leading to 
discontinuation or death, and will be presented in tabular form by system organ class and preferred term. Tabulations of the incidence of DLTs at each dose level will be provided. 
Adverse events will be assessed for severity accordi ng to the NCI CTCAE, version 4.03, 
and the verbatim AE terms will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory 
Activities for purposes of summarization. 
Treatment -emergent AEs will be tabulated, where treatment -emergent is defined as any 
AE that occurs during or after administration of the first dose of study drug through 
30 days after the last dose of study drug, any event that is considered study drug- related 
regardless of the start date of the event, or any event that is present at baseline but worsens in intensity or is subsequently considered study drug- related by the Investigator.

28 February 2018  Part 2:  
Overall response rate is defined as the proportion of patients with a confirmed best 
response of CR or PR. Overall response rate will be estimated and 95% CI based on the exact binomial distribution will be presented.  
An observed ORR of ≥ 26% in 31 patients in Group 2 will result in an exact binomial 
95% CI with a lower bound greater than 10% (Table 13), which is clinically meaningful, 
and exceeds the ORR expected with available therapies Cassier et al, 2012; Yoo et al, 
2015 ). 
An observed ORR of ≥ 20% in 50 pa
tients in Group 3 will result in an exact binomial 
95% CI with a lower bound greater than 10% ( Table 14), which is clinically meaningful, 
and exceeds the ORR expected with available therapies  (Goodman et al, 2007; Sutent 
[package insert] ). 
An observed ORR of ≥ 11% in 100 patients in Group 1 will result in an exact binomial 95% CI with a lower bound greater than 5% ( Kang et al, 2013; Stivarga [package insert] ). 
An observed ORR of ≥ 17% in 100 patients will result in an exact binomial 95% CI with a lower bound greater than 10% ( Table 15 ).

ECG Assessment : 
In Part 2, the effects of BLU-285 on ECG param eters will be evaluated for approximately 
20 patients using 12-lead ECGs extracted from continuous recordings (12-lead Holter) on 
C1D1 and C1D15. Individual ECGs will be extracted in replicate from the 12- lead Holter 
recordings at specified time points and  will be evaluated by a central laboratory. QT 
intervals will be measured from Lead II and will be corrected for heart rate (QTc) using Fridericia’s correction factors. The primary QTc parameter will be QTcF. Secondary parameters (heart rate, PR, and QRS, and T-wave morphology) will also be evaluated. 
Potential effects of BLU -285 will be evaluated as change- from predose baseline heart 
rate, PR, QRS, and QTcF by post-dosing time point. For the purpose of QT assessment, 
exposure- response analysis will be perf ormed on the relationship between BLU-285 
systemic levels and change in QTcF.  
11.5.5  Secondary Endpoint(s)  
Pharmacokinetics:  
Pharmacokinetic parameters will be calculated from the plasma concentration -time data 
using standard non-compartmental methods and/or by suitable models that describe BLU -
285 disposition. Descriptive statistics (i.e., n, mean, standard deviation, geometric mean, coefficient of variation, median, minimum, maximum, and 95% CIs) will be used to summarize PK parameters for each dose level. The dose versus systemic exposure relationships will be assessed graphically. Pharmacokinetic parameters of interest will include maximum plasma drug concentration ( C
max), time to maximum plasma drug 
concentration (T max), time of last quantifiable plasma drug concentration (T last), area 
under the plasma concentration versus time curve from time 0 to 24 hours postdose (AUC
0-24), plasma drug concentration at 24 hours postdose (C 24); apparent volume of 
distribution (V z/F), terminal elimination half -life (t ½), appa rent oral clearance (CL/F), and 
accumulation ratio (R). Additional details of the PK analyses, including combined analyses of the ECG and PK parameters, will be contained in the statistical analysis plan (SAP).

28 February 2018  Efficacy : 
Progression free survival is defined as the time f r om the  sta rt of  treatment to the  date of 
first documented disease progression or death. Progression free survival will be described 
using Kaplan-Meier methods and will include the estimated median with 95% CIs and 
25th and 75th percentiles. Estimated P FS rate at 3-, 6-, and 12- month la ndmarks  will a lso 
be presente d. If a patient has not had an event, PFS is censored at the date of last response 
assessment that is s table or  better. 
Duration of response is defined as the time from first documented response (CR/PR) to 
the date of first documented disease progression or death; and is limited to the subset of 
patients with confirme d CR or PR. Duration of response will be describe d using 
Kaplan- Meier me thods  and will inc lude  the e s timated me dian w ith 95% CIs and 25th and 
75th percentiles. Censoring rules for DOR will be the same as those for PFS. 
Clinical benefit rate is defined as the proportion of patients with a confirmed CR/PR, or

    12 ETHICS AND RESPONSIBILITIES  
12.1 Good Clinical Practice  
The study will be conducted in accordance with the International Conference on 
Harmonization (ICH) for GCP and the appropriate regulatory requirement(s). The Investigator will be thoroughly familiar with the appropriate use of the study drug as described i n the protocol and IB. Essential clinical documents will be maintained to 
demonstrate the validity of the study and the integrity of the data collected. Master files should be established at the beginning of the study, maintained for the duration of the study, and retained according to the appropriate regulations. 
12.2 Data and Safety Monitoring Committee  
A formal independent data monitoring committee will not be used for this study. This is an open- label, Phase 1 study in which all patients receive single-agent BLU -285. The 
Sponsor will have access to the safety data on a regular basis. The Sponsor Clinical Study Team will host Investigator teleconferences on a regular basis during the study. During the Part 1 of the study, the Sponsor Clinical Study Team and the Investigators will meet at the end of each treatment cohort to discuss and evaluate all of the gathered safety data. At the dose-escalation teleconference, safety information, including DLTs and all Grade 2 or worse AEs reported during C1, and all availa ble PK data will be described 
and reviewed for each patient in the current dose cohort. Updated safety, PK and other data for all other ongoing patients, including data from later cycles, will also be discussed.  
Dose -escalation decisions will be based on an evaluation of all relevant, available data, 
and not solely on DLT information. The selection of the dose for the next cohort of 
patients will be limited to a 100% increase for the first escalation and 50% thereafter, or to the addition of 3 patients with no dose increase, as described in Section 6.4. However, the actual dose level chosen may be less than the maximum permitted, and will be based on a medical review of relevant clinical and available PK data. The Sponsor Clinical Study Team and the Investigators must reach agreement on whether to determine that the MTD has been achieved, to escalate the dose further, or to de- escalate to a lower dose.  
12.3 Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics Committee  
The study will be conducted in accordance with ethical principles founded in the Declaration of Helsinki.  
The Investigator must obtain IRB/IEC approval for the investigation and must submit written documentation of the approval to the Sponsor before he or she can enroll any patient into the study. The IRB/IEC will review all appropriate study documentation in 
order to safeguard the rights, safety, and well- being of the patients. The study will only 
be conducted at sites where IRB/IEC approval has been obtained. The protocol, IB, informed consent, advertisements (if applicable), written information given to the patients, safety updates, annual progress reports, and any revisions to these documents 
Protocol BLU -285-1101 Amendment 8  Confidential  
Avapritinib  Page 96 of 110 
 
 
   28 February 2018  
   
    will be provided to the IRB/IEC. The IRB/IEC is to be notified of any amendment to t he 
protocol in accordance with local requirements. Progress reports and notifications of 
serious unexpected adverse drug reactions will be provided to the IRB/IEC according to local regulations and guidelines. 
12.4 Informed Consent  
The Investigator at each cent er will ensure that the patient is given full and adequate oral 
and written information about the nature, purpose, possible risk, and benefit of the study. 
Patients must also be notified that they are free to discontinue from the study at any time. The pat ient should be given the opportunity to ask questions and allowed time to consider 
the information provided. 
After the study has been fully explained, written informed consent, including separate 
consent for exploratory biomarker research to be conducted on biological samples collected during the study, will be obtained from either the patient or his/her guardian or legal representative prior to study participation.  
The patient’s signed and dated informed consent must be obtained before conducting any study-related procedures. The Investigator must maintain the original, signed consent form. A copy of the signed form must be given to the patient. 
The method of obtaining and documenting the informed consent and the contents of the 
consent will comply with ICH -GCP and all applicable regulatory requirement(s).  
12.5 Records Management  
All data for the patients recruited for the study will be entered onto the eCRFs via an Electronic Data Capture system provided by the Sponsor or designee. Only authorized staff may ente r data into the eCRFs. If an entry error is made, the corrections to the 
eCRFs will be made according to eCRF guidelines by an authorized member of the site staff.  
Electronic case report forms will be checked for correctness against source document data by  the Sponsor’s monitor. If any entries into the eCRF are incorrect or incomplete, 
the monitor will ask the Investigator or the study site staff to make appropriate corrections, and the corrected eCRF will again be reviewed for completeness and consistency. Any discrepancies will be noted in the eCRF system by means of electronic data queries. Authorized site staff will be asked to respond to all electronic queries according to the eCRF guidelines. 
12.6 Source Documentation 
Source documents/eCRFs will be completed for each study patient. It is the Investigator’s 
responsibility to ensure the accuracy, completeness, and timeliness of the data reported in the patient’s source document/eCRF. The source document/eCRF should indicate the 
Protocol BLU -285-1101 Amendment 8  Confidential  
Avapritinib  Page 97 of 110 
 
 
   28 February 2018  
   
    patient’s participation in the s tudy and should document the dates and details of study 
procedures, AEs, and patient status. 
The Investigator, or designated representative, should complete the source 
document/eCRF as soon as possible after information is collected, preferably on the same day that a study patient is seen for an examination, treatment, or any other study procedure. Any outstanding entries must be completed immediately after the final examination. An explanation should be given for all missing data. 
The Investigator must sign and date the Investigator’s Statement at the end of the source 
document/eCRF to endorse the recorded data.  
The Investigator will retain all completed source documents. 
12.7 Study Files and Record Retention 
The Investigator will maintain all study records acc ording to ICH- GCP and applicable 
regulatory requirement(s). Records will be retained for at least 2 years after the last 
marketing application approval or 2 years after formal discontinuation of the clinical development of the investigational product or according to applicable regulatory requirement(s). If the Investigator withdraws from the responsibility of keeping the study records, custody must be transferred to a person willing to accept the responsibility. The Sponsor must be notified in writing if a custodial change occurs.  
12.8 Liability and Insurance  
The Sponsor has subscribed to an insurance policy covering, in its terms and provisions, its legal liability for injuries caused to participating persons and arising out of this research performed strictly i n accordance with the scientific protocol as well as with 
applicable law and professional standards. 
Protocol BLU -285-1101 Amendment 8  Confidential  
Avapritinib  Page 98 of 110 
28 February 2018  13 AUDITING AND MONITORING  
The study will be monitored by the Sponsor or its designee. Monitoring will be done by 
personal visits from a representative of the  Sponsor (site monitor) and will include on- site 
review of the source documents/eCRFs for completeness and clarity, cross- checking with 
source documents, and clarification of administrative matters will be performed. The review of medical records will be p erformed in a manner to ensure that patient 
confidentiality is maintained.  
The site monitor will ensure that the investigation is conducted according to protocol design and regulatory requirements by frequent communications. 
All unused study drug and other study materials should be destroyed or returned to the 
Sponsor or designee after the study has been completed, as directed by the Sponsor. 
Regulatory authorities, the IEC/IRB, and/or the Sponsor’s clinical quality assurance 
group or designee may request access to all source documents, eCRFs, and other study documentation for an on- site audit or inspection. Direct access to these documents must 
be guaranteed by the Investigator, who must provide support at all times for these activities.

28 February 2018  14 AMENDMENTS  
Protocol modifications, except those intended to reduce immediate risk to study patients, 
may be made only by Blueprint Medicines. A protocol change intended to eliminate an apparent immediate hazard to patients may be implemented immediately, provided the IRB/IEC  is notified within 5 days. 
Any permanent change to the protocol must be handled as a protocol amendment. The written amendment must be submitted to the IRB/IEC and the Investigator must await approval before implementing the changes. Blueprint Medicines w ill submit protocol 
amendments to the appropriate regulatory authorities for approval. 
If in the judgment of the IRB/IEC, the Investigator, and/or Blueprint Medicines, the 
amendment to the protocol substantially changes the study design and/or increases the potential risk to the patient and/or has an impact on the patient's involvement as a study participant, the currently approved written informed consent form will require similar modification. In such cases, informed consent will be renewed for patients enrolled in the study before continued participation.

    19 APPENDICES  
19.1 Appendix 1  
MODIFICATIONS TO RESPONSE EVALUATION CRITERIA IN 
SOLID TUMORS VERSION 1.1 (RECIST 1.1), FOR PATIENTS 
WITH GIST 
1. No lymph nodes to be chosen as target lesions. Enlarged lymph nodes are to be 
followed up as non- target lesions  
2. No bone lesions to be chosen as target lesions 
3. 18Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomograph y (18FDG -PET) is not acceptable 
for radiological assessment  
4. A progressively growing new tumor nodule within a pre- existing tumor mass must 
meet the following criteria in order to be regarded as unequivocal evidence of progressive disease according to the a forementioned GIST -specific modifications to 
RECIST 1.1: 
a. The lesion must be ≥  2 cm in size and definitely be a new active GIST lesions 
(e.g., enhanced with contrast or other criteria to rule out artifact); or  
b. The lesion must be expanding on at least 2 sequential imaging studies.

1.2 Synopsis
AbbVie Inc. Protocol Number:   M12-817
Name of Study Drug:   Elagolix (ABT-620) Phase of Development:   3
Name of Active Ingredient:   Elagolix sodium Date of Protocol Synopsis:   06 October 2017
Protocol Title:   A Phase 3 Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Elagolix in Combination with 
Estradiol/Norethindrone Acetate for the Management of Heavy Menstrual Bleeding Associated with 
Uterine Fibroids in Premenopausal Women
Objectives:   The objectives of this study are 1) to assess the efficacy, safety and tolerability of elagolix 
300 mg BID in combination with E2/NETA (estradiol 1.0 mg/norethindrone acetate 0.5 mg QD), versus placebo to reduce heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) associated with uterine fibroids in premenopausal women 18 to 51 years of age, and 2) to characterize the impact of E2/NETA on the safety/tolerability [including bone mineral density (BMD) and other hypoestrogenic side effects] and efficacy of elagolix.
Investigators:   Multicenter trial.  Investigator information is on file at AbbVie.
Study Sites:   Approximately 125 sites
Study Population:   Premenopausal female subjects (aged 18 to 51 years, inclusive) with uterine fibroids 
and HMB (> 80 mL blood loss per menstrual cycle).
Number of Subjects to be Enrolled:   Approximately 400
Methodology:   
This Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, multicenter, placebo-controlled study is designed to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of elagolix alone and in combination with E2/NETA in the management of premenopausal women with HMB associated with uterine fibroids.  Approximately 400 subjects will be randomized in a 1:1:2 ratio of placebo to active treatment alone and in combination with E2/NETA to one of the following three treatment groups:
!placebo (n = 100)
!elagolix 300 mg BID (n = 100)
!elagolix 300 mg BID plus E2/NETA (estradiol 1.0 mg/norethindrone acetate 0.5mg) QD (n = 200)
Study Duration:  The total duration for this study is approximately 21 months.
The study consists of 4 periods:
!Washout Period prior to Screening (only applicable if subject is taking hormonal medication at the time of consent; duration of washout depends on the type of hormonal medication).
!Screening Period – approximately 2.5 to 3.5 months prior to first dose of study drug.
!Treatment Period – 6-month treatment duration.
!Post-Treatment Follow-Up Period – 12-month period, OR instead of entering the Post-Treatment Follow-Up Period, subjects may enter into an extension study (Study M12-816) if they are willing and qualify, based on safety parameters, to receive an additional 6 months of treatment, followed by 12 months of follow-up.

Washout Period:
Following informed consent, subjects, who are taking or were taking exclusionary medications such as 
hormonal medications or antifibrinolytics prior to screening that require washout, must enter a Washout Period.  Subjects must complete the Washout Period and have had at least 1 menses after completion of washout, prior to entering the Screening Period.  The duration of the required washout period is based on the excluded hormonal medication that the subject is currently taking, or was taking.  Procedures such as medical, social and gynecological history, a complete physical examination (including height and weight) with vital signs and urine pregnancy testing, protocol-related adverse event review will be performed and current medications will be documented.  Contraceptive counseling will be provided, and contraceptives dispensed, as necessary.  A pelvic ultrasound (transabdominal [TAU] and transvaginal [TVU]) may be performed after obtaining informed consent and prior to a subject entering the Washout Period in order to establish the presence of a qualifying fibroid(s) or uterine volume to avoid an unnecessary and lengthy washout period.
Screening Period:
Following informed consent (if Washout was not required), subjects will enter into an approximate 2.5-
to 3.5-month Screening Period to establish eligibility based on inclusion and exclusion criteria. A pelvic ultrasound (TAU and TVU) will be performed to confirm the presence and size of qualifying uterine fibroids and uterine volume and to rule out exclusionary ovarian cysts.  In addition to the ultrasound, a saline infusion sonohysterography (SIS) will be conducted to rule out exclusionary gynecological disorders such as pedunculated submucosal fibroids and endometrial polyps.  An endometrial biopsy will be performed to rule out endometrial pathology.  A mammogram in subjects who will be 39 years of age or older at the time of randomization will be performed unless the subject had a mammogram performed within 3 months prior to Screening.  DXA scans will be performed to evaluate bone mineral density (BMD) for determination of eligibility.  During the Screening Period, subjects must demonstrate MBL of > 80 mL for each of two menses as measured by the alkaline hematin method which quantifies the amount of blood loss on sanitary products.  Subjects will be dispensed sanitary product collection kits for 2 to 3 menstrual cycles and will be required to collect all sanitary products on days with menstrual bleeding or spotting, and must return the products to the site within approximately 5 days after cessation of menses.  Subjects must be instructed to collect and return all used or worn products even if there 
is no visible blood on the products.   Subjects will also complete the Screening-Baseline Columbia 
Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) questionnaire to assess suicidal behavior and ideation. 
Treatment Period:
The Treatment Period begins with Day 1, which will occur between Days 1 to 10 of the first day of 
menses (defined as full menstrual flow) for all subjects who meet eligibility criteria during the Screening Period.
Subjects will be randomized to receive either placebo (n = 100), elagolix 300 mg BID (n = 100) or 
elagolix 300 mg BID plus E2/NETA (n = 200).  All subjects will self-administer study medication or matching placebo twice daily (in the morning and in the evening approximately 12 hours apart) orally throughout the 6-month Treatment Period.  Subjects randomized into the study will visit the site during the 6-Month Treatment Period on Day 1, and then monthly (28-day intervals), at Month 1 through 
Month 6.  Additional study visits may occur either for subjects returning their sanitary products for analysis of alkaline hematin at a Product Collection Visit or for a Premature Discontinuation visit.

Treatment Period (Continued):
Treatment Period Assessments:
Sanitary product collection kits will continue to be dispensed at all Treatment Period visits.  Subjects will 
be required to collect all sanitary products on days with menstrual bleeding or spotting and return them to the clinical study site, either during a scheduled monthly visit or at a Product Collection Visit.  Subjects 
must be instructed to collect and return all used or worn products even if there is no visible blood 
on the products.   If a subject does not return a sanitary product collection keg at any site visit (scheduled 
monthly visit or Product Collection visit), the Site Staff will administer the Uterine Bleeding Questionnaire (UBQ) to record if she had any bleeding or spotting since the last study visit.  If the subject had bleeding or spotting since the last study visit, the Site Staff will record the subjects response indicating why she did not collect products or return a sanitary product collection keg.
A pelvic ultrasound will be performed in all subjects at Day 1, Month 3, Month 6 or Premature 
Discontinuation Visit, if applicable, to assess volume of the largest fibroid, uterine volume, endometrial thickness and potential presence of ovarian and uterine pathology.  During the Treatment Period, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRIs) in a subset of subjects will be conducted at Day 1 and Month 6 or Premature Discontinuation Visit, if applicable to assess fibroid and uterine volume.  An endometrial biopsy will be performed in all subjects at the Month 6 or premature discontinuation visit.  It is recommended that the pelvic ultrasound, MRI (if applicable) and endometrial biopsy procedures be performed within the – 15 day procedure window).
Subjects will be asked to complete several patien t-reported outcome questionnaires, such as the 
EQ-5D-5L, Uterine Fibroid Symptom Questionnaire (UFS-QoL), Work Productivity and Activity 
Impairment (WPAI) questionnaire, Health Care Resource Utilization questionnaire (HCRU), C-SSRS –Since Last Visit questionnaire and Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC), based on bleeding and non-bleeding uterine fibroid symptoms.  Site Staff will administer the Uterine Bleeding Questionnaire (UBQ), as applicable and the HCRU.  The Investigator will complete the Physician Surgery Questionnaire.
Pregnancy (urine and/or serum) tests will be performed at each visit throughout the study.  Subjects will 
be counseled at each visit on appropriate and effective forms of dual non-hormonal contraceptives to promote pregnancy prevention.
During the Treatment Period, blood samples will be collected for assay of serum estradiol and 
progesterone, and to measure plasma concentrations of elagolix and NETA.
Subjects will provide blood samples for Clinical Safety Labs, (including lipid panel) and for subjects who 
consent, a DNA pharmacogenetic sample will be collected on Day 1 and an RNA pharmacogenetic sample will be collected on Day 1, Month 1, Month 3 and Month 6 or Premature Discontinuation.
DXA scans will be obtained at Month 6 of the Treatment Period.  Sites will be encouraged to schedule the Month 6 DXA as early as possible within the – 15-day Month 6 treatment window, allowing for the evaluation of BMD prior to entering post-treatment fo llow-up or the extension study, Study M12-816.  
Subjects with BMD decrease < 8% in spine, total hip and femoral neck will be eligible for entry into the extension study.  Subject's with ≥ 8% decrease in BMD in the spine, total hip or femoral neck at Month 6 
of the Treatment Period are ineligible for entry into the extension study and will enter into the Post-Treatment Follow-up Period.

Post-Treatment Follow-Up Period:
Eligible subjects who complete the 6-month Treatment Period, may, following consent, enter a separate 
extension study for 6 additional months of treatment with elagolix (for further details, refer to the StudyM12-816 protocol synopsis). Subjects who prematurely discontinue from treatment, decline to participate in, or do not qualify for the extension study, will enter 12-month the Post-Treatment Follow-Up Period.
For subjects entering the 12-month Post-Treatment Follow-Up Period, visits will be conducted either by 
phone or on-site from Month 1 through Month 12.  (Subjects who prematurely discontinue from the Treatment Period prior to the Month 3 Study visit, are not required to have the pelvic ultrasound, MRI [if applicable] or DXA [unless the reason for discontinuation was due to BMD decrease or occurrence of fracture] performed in the Post-Treatment Follow-up Period and will complete the study at the Post-Treatment Follow-up Month 6 visit.)  Post-Treatment Follow-up Months 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 are on-site visits while Post-Treatment Follow-up Months 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10 and 11 are Phone Visits.
During the phone visits, site personnel will discuss adverse events, concomitant medications, if 
applicable, obtain the results of the subject's self-administered urine pregnancy test and will remind subjects of the importance of consistent use of appropriate and effective dual non-hormonal contraception through the Post-Treatment Follow-Up Period.  Subjects may begin taking hormonal contraception or Tranexamic Acid (Lysteda, Cyklokapron, Cyclo-f) after completing the Post-Treatment Follow-Up Month 2 Visit and having returned to first full menses in the Post-Treatment Follow-up Period.
Subjects will be required to collect sanitary products for the first full menses in the Post-Treatment 
Follow-up Period.  Subjects will return the sanitary products at a Product Collection Visit within approximately 5 days after cessation of bleeding or spotting.
During the Post-Treatment Month 3 and Post-Treatment Month 6 on-site visits, procedures such as TAU, 
TVU, MRI (if applicable), DXA, clinical safety labs and pregnancy testing will be performed.  At the Post-Treatment Period Month 12 visit, procedures including vital signs, lipid panel, Apolipoprotein A and B and DXA will be performed.
Adverse event and concomitant medication review will be conducted at all visits during the 
Post-Treatment Follow-Up Period, including the phone visits.  
Central Laboratory and Central Imaging Vendors:
DXA, Ultrasound, SIS, MRI (if applicable), safety clinical lab samples including Apo A, and Apo B, 
endocrine panels, and alkaline hematin will be analyzed/evaluated using central laboratories or vendors.  Assays for PK, PD and PG will be analyzed at AbbVie.
Analysis of Menstrual Blood Loss:
This study will utilize the alkaline hematin (AH) method for measuring MBL from screening through the 
first full menses in the Post-Treatment Follow-up Period.  Alkaline hematin is an objective and reliable measurement of total MBL based on the quantitation of menstrual blood collected on sanitary products.

Criteria for Evaluation:
Efficacy:
The analysis will compare 6 months of treatment with  elagolix with and without add-back therapy, 
estradiol/norethindrone acetate (E2/NETA) to placebo.
Primary Efficacy Endpoint:The primary endpoint will be the percentage of subjects meeting a composite endpoint consisting of these 
two bleeding assessments:
!MBL volume < 80 mL during the Final Month (the last 28 days of treatment), AND
!50% or greater re duction in MBL volume from baseline to the Final Month (the last 28 days of 
treatment).
A subject who prematurely discontinues the study drug due to adverse events, "lack of efficacy," or "requires surgery or invasive intervention for treatment of uterine fibroids" will be considered as a non-responder regardless whether she meets the two aforementioned responder criteria or not.
Secondary Efficacy Variables:
!MBL volume assessed using alkaline hematin methodology and UBQ
!Suppression of bleeding
!Hemoglobin concentration 
!Fibroid and uterine volume
!UFS-QoL Questionnaire
!EuroQol (EQ-5D-5L) Questionnaire
!Health Care Resource Utilization (HCRU) Questionnaire
!Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) Questionnaires
!Work Productivity and Activity Impairment (WPAI) Questionnaire
Safety:
Safety evaluations include physical examination, vital signs, ECG, BMD changes, endometrial 
assessment (endometrial thickness and biopsy), clinical laboratory tests (hematology, chemistry, urinalysis, lipid panel) and adverse event monitoring.

Statistical Methods:
Efficacy:
Primary Efficacy Analysis:
The primary analysis will be based on the modified intent-to-treat (mITT) analysis set which is 
comprised of all randomized subjects who took at least one dose of the study drug and have at least one post-baseline visit in this study.
The baseline MBL volume will be defined as the mean of MBL volume from the qualified menstrual 
cycles during the Screening Period prior to the first study drug dose date, in which the total MBL volume is from all validated and non-validated sanitary products that subjects returned and where the total MBL volume of validated sanitary products only (excluding non-validated sanitary products) is greater than 80 mL.  All menstrual cycles during the Screening Period in which the total MBL volume of validated sanitary products only is less than or equal to 80 mL are not qualified to be considered for baseline.
Final Month is defined as the last 28 days of treatment prior to and including the last dose date.
The primary endpoint will be analyzed using a logistic regression model including treatment as the main 
effect and baseline MBL volume as a covariate.  Missing Final Month MBL volume will be imputed using multiple imputation.
The primary efficacy comparison will be between the elagolix 300 mg BID plus E2/NETA group and the 
placebo group.  Therefore, no multiplicity adjustment is necessary.
Analyses for Secondary Efficacy Variables:
In general, data will be summarized for the Treatment Period and Post-Treatment Period separately.  Data 
for the Treatment Period will be summarized for each treatment group and compared between each elagolix treatment group and the placebo group.
The percentage of subjects with MBL volume < 80 mL and 50% or greater reduction in MBL volume 
from baseline during the Treatment Period will be summarized for each treatment group and compared between each elagolix treatment group and the placebo group.  Also, the individual component (the percentage of subjects with MBL volume of < 80 mL as well as the percentage of subjects with ≥  50% 
reduction in MBL volume from baseline) will be summarized. 
The change and percent change from baseline in MBL volume to each month and to the Final Month, 
will be summarized for each treatment group and compared between each elagolix treatment group and the placebo group.
The percentage of subjects with suppression of bleeding and the percentage of subjects with amenorrhea 
will be summarized by monthly intervals throughout the Treatment Period.  In addition, the cumulative percentage of subjects with suppression of bleeding and the cumulative percentage of subjects with amenorrhea will be summarized by treatment group.

Statistical Methods (Continued):
Efficacy (Continued):
Analyses for Secondary Efficacy Variables (Continued):
The change from baseline to monthly intervals in number of bleeding days will be summarized by 
treatment group.  In addition, the change from baseline in total number of sanitary products will be summarized by treatment group. 
The change and percent change from baseline in hemoglobin concentration will be summarized for each 
treatment group and compared between each elagolix treatment group and the placebo group.
The change and percent change from baseline in primary fibroid volume, total fibroid volume, and 
uterine volume will be summarized for each treatment group and compared between each elagolix treatment group and the placebo group.  The change from baseline for quality of life assessments (e.g., UFS-QoL, EQ-5D-5L) will be summarized for each treatment group and compared between each 
elagolix treatment group and the placebo group. 
For the PGIC-MB and PGIC-NBUFS, the number and percentage of subjects in each response category 
will be summarized by treatment group.
Safety
All randomized subjects who took at least one dose of the study drug will be included in the safety 
analyses.  The number and percentage of subjects having adverse events will be tabulated by primary SOC and MedDRA Preferred Term with a breakdown by treatment group.  Hematology, chemistry, urinalysis, lipid panel, vital signs and endometrial biopsy variables will be summarized.
To evaluate BMD change, the percent change from baseline to Month 6 in the Treatment Period using aggregated data from two pivotal studies (Studies M12-815 and M12-817) will be compared between each elagolix treatment group and the placebo group as well as between the elagolix 300 mg BID group and the elagolix 300 mg BID plus E2/NETA group using analysis of co-variance (ANCOVA) with treatment as the main effect and baseline BMD as a covariate.  Two-sided 95% confidence intervals will be constructed for the differences in percent change from baseline to Month 6 in BMD.
Sample Size:
Approximately 400 subjects will be randomized (1:1:2) to placebo (N = 100), elagolix 300 mg BID 
(N = 100), or elagolix 300 mg BID plus E2/NETA (N = 200) for 24 weeks of dosing.  The sample size will provide at least 90% power to detect a difference between the elagolix 300 mg BID plus E2/NETA group and the placebo group in the percentage of subjects with MBL volume < 80 mL during the Final Month (the last 28 days of treatment) and 50% or greater reduction in MBL volume from baseline to the Final Month under the assumption of responder rates being 60% and 30% for elagolix 300 mg BID plus E2/NETA and placebo, respectively.
Pharmacokinetic:
Plasma concentrations of elagolix and norethindrone will be listed for each subject by visit day and dose 
regimen.  Pharmacokinetic data may be combined with data from other studies in women.  Exposure-response analyses may be conducted as appropriate.
Pharmacodynamic:
Serum concentrations of estradiol, progesterone, FSH, and LH will be listed for each subject by visit day 
and dose regimen.

3.0 Introduction
3.1 Uterine Fibroids
Uterine fibroids (leiomyomata) are the most common benign tumors in women and occur 
in up to 80% of women of reproductive age.1  The incidence increases with age, and 
uterine fibroids are the most common reason for hysterectomy in the United States.1,2  
Uterine fibroids may develop in African-American women on average 10 years earlier than in white women.
3  The overall cost of symptomatic uterine fibroids exceeds 
$2 billion per year in the Un ited States.4
The growth of uterine fibroids is highly dependent on both estrogen and progesterone.5  
Although often asymptomatic, fibroids may cause symptoms severe enough to warrant therapy in 20% to 50% of women
3and the most common symptom is heavy or prolonged 
menstrual bleeding.  Other symptoms may include anemia, pelvic pressure and pelvic organ compression, back pain, and adverse reproductive outcomes.  Heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) (menorrhagia, defined as > 80 mL per menstrual cycle)
1is extremely 
inconvenient, can significantly impact quality of life and may lead to iron-deficiency anemia.
The choice of treatment is based on individual symptoms, patient preference, and the 
desire to preserve either fertility or the uterus or both.  Histor ically, hysterectomy or 
myomectomy were the preferred treatment opti ons for women with symptomatic uterine 
fibroids.
2  However, surgery is also associated with risks such as infections, bleeding 
complications, thromboembolic effects, scarring/adhesions, and even increased mortality.6  
As more women delay pregnancy into their 30s and 40s, there is a growing need for alternatives to surgical treatments, especially hysterectomy.  To meet this demand, during the past 2 decades many new uterus-sparing therapies have been proposed and studied including semi-invasive procedures, such as uterine artery embo lization and magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI)-guided high-intensi ty focused ultrasound ablation therapy as 
well as nonsurgical, medical treatments.  There is no long-term medical treatment for

symptomatic uterine fibroids.  Treatment with GnRH agonists such as Lupron®is 
effective but induces full gonadal suppression and menopause-like symptoms that limit 
their use to 3 months of presurgical treatment.  High-dose progestins, oral contraceptives and tranexamic acid (Lysteda
®-an antifibrinolytic drug) are used for short-term 
management of heavy uterine bleeding only.  Recently, the selective progesterone receptor modulator (SPRM), ulipristal acetate, has been approved in the EU as a short-term preoperative treatment, as well as an extended intermittent treatment of women with of symptomatic uterine fibroids.
The ideal medical treatment for symptomatic uterin e fibroids, as an alternative to surgical 
interventions, should control HMB, improve non-bleeding symptoms and quality of life, 
and prove safe and tolerable as a chronic therapy.  Unfortunately, currently available medical options provide only short-term improv ement of symptoms, and as such, are only 
indicated prior to surgery, and/or their side-effects limit their long-term use.  A safe and effective chronic medical therapy for the management of HMB associated with uterine fibroids, as an alternative to hysterectomy or other surgical intervention, has not yet been approved.
3.2 Elagolix
Elagolix is an orally active, non-peptide (G nRH) antagonist that is being developed by 
AbbVie for the management of endometriosis-related pain and the chronic management of 
HMB associated with symptomatic uterine fi broids.  The initial preclinical and clinical 
evaluation of elagolix was conducted by Neurocrine Biosciences Inc. (NBI).  Safety results from these studies show that elagolix  is generally well tolerated.  Elagolix, unlike 
injectable GnRH analogs, produces a dose dependent suppression of pituitary and ovarian hormone levels in women, i.e., from parti al ovarian suppression at lower doses to full 
suppression at higher doses.  A detailed discussion of the preclinical t oxicology, 
metabolism, pharmacology and pharmacokinetics of elagolix in humans and a summary of clinical studies can be found in the Investigator's Brochure and is also discussed in lesser detail in Section 3.2.1and Section 3.2.2.

The initial 3-month, Phas e 2a, dose-finding, Proof-of-Concept (POC) study 
(StudyM12-663) evaluated total daily doses (TDDs) of elagolix of 200, 400, and 600 mg 
in premenopausal women with HMB associated with uterine fibroids.  Data from this study indicated that an elagolix TDD of 600 mg best met the agreed-upon dose selection criteria for Phase 2b and Phase 3 (predicated on a dose in Phase 2a that provided the most robust response [responder rates of approximately > 80% for the composite bleeding assessment] and an acceptable safety and bleeding profile for the majority of women).  It was known that to support long-term dosing with  elagolix at these higher doses, low dose 
hormonal add-back therapy would be required to mitigate bone loss and minimize other 
hypoestrogenic adverse events, e.g., hot flush.
Subsequently, a 6-month safety and efficacy Phase 2b study (Study M12-813) evaluating 
elagolix TDD of 600 mg (administered as 300 mg BID [twice daily] in Cohort 1 or 600 mg QD in Cohort 2) with and without add-back therapy was conducted.  As add-back therapy, the study evaluated two doses of E2/NETA (low dose, 0.5 mg/0.1 mg and 
standard dose, 1.0 mg/0.5 mg).  Preliminary results from Cohort 1 demonstrated that treatment with elagolix 300 mg BID alone a nd in combination with E2/NETA provided 
robust efficacy in controlling HMB associated with uterine fibroids and provided an acceptable safety/tolerability profile that coul d potentially support the proposed chronic 
use indication.  While similar efficacy results were noted in Cohort 2 (elagolix 600 mg QD), review of the totality of data (preclinical, Phase 1 and Phase 2) comparing two dosing regimens support selection of the 300 mg BID + standard dose E2/NETA as the regimen for Phase 3.  
Additional details on rationale for dose selection are included in Section 5.6.4.
3.2.1 Preclinical Experience
3.2.1.1 Toxicology
Elagolix has been well characterized in repeated-dose animal toxicity studies of up to 
15 weeks in mouse, 28 weeks in rat, 39 weeks (9 months) in dog and 13 weeks in monkey.  
Elagolix (ABT-620)
M12-817 Protocol Amendment 2
32
The safety margin for the 200 mg BID human dose for the endometriosis indication is 
approximately 8.6 (28 week rat study) and 7.5 (9 month dog study).  
There were no significant findings from in vitro and in vivo genotoxicity studies. Also, 
there was no significant increase in tumors in the 2-year mouse carcinogenicity study with 
elagolix sodium.  In the 2-year rat carci nogenicity study, increase in thyroid or liver 
tumors was rat specific with no risk anticipated for human.
Elagolix is not teratogenic (no fetal abnormaliti es in preclinical studies) based on data 
from the rat and rabbit Segment II studies.  However, there were non-teratogenic findings, 
e.g., observations of abortions in rabbit and post-implantation loss in rat at higher doses.  These could either be due to maternal toxicity or related to indirect pharmacological activity.  
Please refer to the most recent edition of the elagolix Investigator Brochure for complete 
information on toxicology studies for elagolix.
3.2.2 Clinical Experience
Refer to Edition 15 of the elagolix Investigator's Brochure (April 2016 or the most recent 
version) for the complete information on clinical studies, exposure to study drug, and safety.
Clinical Program Overview
As of 31 January 2016, a total of 3,417 subjects have received at least 1 dose of elagolix 
in clinical studies conducted by NBI and AbbVie (30 Phase 1 studies, 6 Phase 2 endometriosis studies, 2 Phase 2 uterine fi broid studies [Studies M12-663 and M12-813], 
2 Phase 3 endometriosis studies [Studies M12-665 and M12-667] and 2 ongoing Phase 3 endometriosis extension studies [Studies M12-667 and M12-821]).  More than 1,000 of these subjects were dosed for ≥ 6 weeks.  Of the 3,417 subjects, 95 were healthy men, 
795 were healthy women, 1,857 were women with  endometriosis, 645 were women with 
uterine fibroids, 16 were women with hepatic impairment, and 9 were women with renal

impairment.  In ongoing studies (including 2 extension studies mentioned above and 
excluding Study M12-671), more than 1,625 s ubjects have received at least 1 dose of 
elagolix.
Twelve Phase 1 clinical studies (7 in healthy men and 5 in healthy women) and 6 Phase 2 
studies (in women with endometriosis) were  completed by NBI.  To date, 18 Phase 1 
studies have been completed by AbbVie.  The Phase 3 endometriosis registration program 
consists of 2 replicate 6-month pivotal studies, Study M12-665 and Study M12-671 and 2 extension studies, Study M12-667 and St udy M12-821, respectively.  In women with 
HMB associated with uterine fibroids, 2 Phase 2 studies have been completed by AbbVie, 
Study M12-663 and Study M12-813.  The Phase 3 uterine fibroid registration program consists of 2 pivotal studies, Study M12-815 and Study M12-817, and a single planned associated 6-month safety/efficacy extension study, Study M12-816.
Clinical Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic Summary
Clinical pharmacokinetic (PK) studies indicate that elagolix is rapidly absorbed from the 
gastrointestinal (GI) tract with time to maximum plasma concentration (T max) of 
approximately 1 hour f or immediate release (IR) tablet formulation.  The following points 
are key findings of elagolix PK:
●Elagolix exposure (area under the plasma concentration versus time curve 
[AUC] and maximum concentration in plasma [C max]) appears to be 
approximately dose-proportional across the daily dose range studied (25 to 
400 mg).  At single daily doses of 600 mg and a bove, more than dose 
proportional increases in elago lix exposures were observed.
●Elagolix displays biphasic disposition with a terminal elimination half-life of approximately 4 to 6 hours.  Little or no accumulation resulted from twice 
daily (BID) (400 mg BID) or once daily (QD) (400 mg QD) dosing at steady 
state.
●Food decreases the AUC of the immediate-release tablet formulation by approximately 25%.
Elagolix (ABT-620)
M12-817 Protocol Amendment 2
34
●Elagolix is a substrate of CYP3A and P-gp and may be a weak inducer of 
CYP3A enzymes.
●Elagolix is primarily excreted in feces as metabolites (64%) and parent compound (26%).  Less than 3% is excreted unchanged in the urine.  Plasma 
exposure of elagolix metabolites was low (< 3% of each metabolite) relative to the parent.
Pharmacodynamic data from the AbbVie multiple-ascending dose (MAD) study, 
StudyM12-790, in premenopausal healthy female subjects showed a dose-dependent suppression of E2, reaching maximum suppression at approximately 200 mg BID.  Anovulatory progesterone levels were observed through Day 21 in all subjects at doses as low as 100 mg BID.  In addition, lu teinizing hormone (LH) a nd follicle-stimulating 
hormone ( FSH) decline in a dose dependent manner, with maximal suppression and near 
maximal suppression, respectively, at 300 mg BID.  The elagolix 400 mg BID dose not appear to result in substantial additional E2 suppression compared with the 300 mg BID dose.
Effects on Ovulation
Elagolix is not a contraceptive and data on ovulation rates from the 3-month 
folliculogenesis study, Study M12-673, showed that the 100 mg BID, 150 mg QD, and 200 mg QD doses do not appear to differentiate.  The percentage of subjects with at least 1 ovulation during the 3 months of elagolix treatment was 47.4% to 57.1%, and the percentage of subjects with ovulation was 28.1% to 33.3% within each month (28-day period).  In contrast, when ovulation rates are counted by subject or by month, the 200 mg BID dose appears to decrease ovulation rates to almost half of that observed with the 150 mg QD dose.
The 300 mg BID dose appeared to have a slightly lower ovulation rate than 200 mg BID 
(27% versus 32%), and when the standard-dose estradiol 1.0 mg/norethindrone acetate 0.5 mg (standard-dose E2/NETA) was co-administered with elagolix 300 mg BID, the ovulation rate d ecreased further to approximately 10%.

Summary of Safety Findings
Adverse Events Across Elagolix Studies
As of 31 January 2016, the most common adverse events overall in the 3,417 subjects 
who received elagolix across all clinical studies were hot flush (598/3,417; 17.5%), headache (546/3,417; 16.0%), and nausea (411/3,417; 12%).  These are also the adverse events that most commonly resulted in discontinuation from study:  hot flush in 33 subjects (1.0%), headache in 15 subjects (0.4%), and nausea in 16 subjects (0.5%). 
Adverse Events in Phase 2 Studies in Uterine Fibroids Study M12-663 Preliminary data from the completed Phase 2a POC study, Study M12-663, show that the 
most commonly reported adverse event in all the elagolix treatment cohorts was hot flush; this was reported for approximately 45% to 63% of the subjects in the cohorts in which elagolix was administered alone.  The use of both add-back therapies [elagolix 200 mg BID + LD (low-dose) E2/NETA QD and elagolix 300 mg BID + cyclical EP] was associated with an approx imate 30% lower overall incidence of hot flush that was 
approximately 30% lower relative to the corresponding elagolix treatment regimen alone. 
Other than hot flushes, the only other adverse events in the elagolix 300 mg BID group 
reported for more than 2 subjects were headache (6 subjects, 20%), and abdominal pain and dizziness (3 subjects each, 10%).  At the 600 mg QD dose of elagolix, the presence of 
nausea (9 subjects), headache (9 subjects), dizziness (6 subjects), and back pain (5 subjects) was more prevalent than in the remaining elagolix treatment cohorts.
Study M12-813 Preliminary data from the completed Phase 2b study, Study M12-813, show that, overall, 
the percentage of subjects who reported treatment-emergent adverse events was generally similar across all treatment groups in both cohorts, ranging from 67.9% to 87.0%, with the highest values in the elagolix alone groups (300 mg BID, 80.0%; 600 mg QD, 87.0%). 
Elagolix (ABT-620)
M12-817 Protocol Amendment 2
36
The most common adverse events in both cohorts were hot flush, insomnia, and headache.  
The rates for hot flush in Cohort 1 were 3.1% for placebo and 44.6% for elagolix 300 mg BID alone, and the addition of low-dose or standard-dose E2/NETA significantly decreased the rates by approximately 20% and 34%, respectively (25.0% for elagolix 300 mg BID + low-dose E2/NETA and 10.8% for elagolix 300 mg BID + standard-dose E2/NETA).  In Cohort 2, the rates of hot flush were 5.1% for placebo and 49.4% for elagolix 600 mg QD alone.  Addition of low-dose or standard-dose E2/NETA significantly decreased the rates by approximately 31% and 35%, respectively (18.4% for elagolix 600 mg QD + low-dose E2/NETA and 14.3% for elagolix 600 mg QD + standard-dose E2/NETA). 
Adverse Events of Special Interest
Adverse events of special interest in elagolix clinical studies include mood changing 
disorders (suicidality and depression), cutane ous adverse events, hot flush, ovarian-related 
events, BMD decrease and fractures, uterine bleeding and changes in serum lipids.  
In the completed Phase 2 studies in uterine fibroids, there was a higher percentage of 
women experiencing cutaneous/hypersensitivity events and hot flush with elagolix treatment compared with placebo.  Adverse events of special interest are monitored 
continuously in all clinical studies.
Serious Adverse Events Across Elagolix Studies
As of 31 January 2016, 129 serious adverse events have been reported by 
92/3,417 (2.7%) subjects who received elagolix.  Serious adverse events in all completed studies and in ongoing Studies M12-667 and M12-821 through the data cutoff date of 31 January 2016 are captured in the analysis for this update.  The most common serious adverse event was pelvic pain occurring in 8 subjects (0.2%) followed by induced abortion and endometriosis, each occurring in 5 subjects (0.1%), and abdominal pain and uterine leiomyoma, each occurring in 4 subjects (0.1%). 
Elagolix (ABT-620)
M12-817 Protocol Amendment 2
37
Among women participating in elagolix clinical trials, one subject delivered an infant with 
congenital pneumonia.  During the Phase 2 clinical development program in endometriosis, there were 2 pregnancy-related serious adverse events (congenital malformations, i.e., 1 cleft palate and 1 tracheoesophageal fistula), which occurred during treatment and were assessed as unrelated to elagolix. 
In the completed Phase 2a study in women with HMB associated with uterine fibroids, 
there were 2 serious adverse events of prolapsed uterine fibroid.  
Based on the preliminary results of Cohort 1 of the Phase 2b study in women with HMB 
associated with uterine fibro ids, as of 31 January 2016, there were 7 serious adverse 
events that either occurred during the Treatment Period or within 30 days of last dose in 8 subjects randomized to receive active treatment.  Four events occurred in the elagolix 300 mg BID alone arm [pulmonary embolism,  deep vein thrombosis (both events 
experienced by the same subject), menorrhagia and endometrial adenocarcinoma]; 2 events occurred in the 300 mg BID plus low-dose activella arm (uterine leiomyoma and hypertension), and 1 event occurred in the 300 mg BID plus standard-dose activella arm (anemia).
Effects of Elagolix on Bone Mineral Density (BMD)
The effects of elagolix 300 mg BID alone and in combination with low-dose and standard 
dose E2/NETA were evaluated in the 6-month Phase 2b study (Study M12-813).  BMD was assessed at the lumbar spine (L1-L4), femoral neck, and total hip via DXA at 
Screening and at Month 6 of the Treatment Period, or Premature Discontinuation.  
Preliminary results from the 6-month Phase 2b uterine fibroid study, Study M12-813, 
demonstrate that treatment with elagolix 300 mg BID and 600 mg QD significantly decrease BMD, which is partially mitigated by  addition of E2/NETA in a dose-dependent 
manner.  In Cohort 1, the mean percentage change from Baseline to Month 6 in BMD in the lumbar spine for the elagolix 300 mg BID alone group was –3.8% at Month 6; 19% of 
Elagolix (ABT-620)
M12-817 Protocol Amendment 2
38
subjects had a 3 to ≤ 5% BMD decrease, 25% had > 5% to < 8% BMD decrease, and 8% 
had a ≥ 8% BMD decrease.
While the addition of low-dose E2/NETA partially prevented BMD loss at the lumbar 
spine at Month 6 of treatment compared to the elagolix alone group (mean change from 
baseline –1.5% versus –3.6%), the E2/NETA (estradiol 1.0 mg/norethindrone acetate 0.5 mg) more substantially mitigated BMD loss at the lumbar spine at Month 6 compared with the elagolix alone group (mean change  from baseline –0.1% versus –3.6%).  In the 
E2/NETA (estradiol 1.0 mg/norethindrone acetate 0.5 mg) group 8.2% of subjects had a 3 to ≤ 5% BMD decrease, 1 subject (2%) had a 5% – 8% BMD decrease and no subjects 
(0%) had ≥ 8% BMD decrease at the lumbar spine. 
Effects of Elagolix on Clinical Laboratory Parameters
Data from the Phase 2 studies with elagolix in women with uterine fibroids showed dose-dependent increases in serum lipid parameters, corresponding to the degree of estrogen suppression and similar to those seen with other GnRH analogs.  Changes in serum lipids, in particular total cholesterol and low-de nsity lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), were 
observed in this study, similar to those observed in postmenopausal women
9and these 
changes, as expected, were somewhat attenuated by E2/NETA in a dose dependent manner.  Mean percentage increases from Baseline in total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), LDL-C, and triglycerides were observed across each of 
the elagolix treatment groups over the 6-month treatment duration.  Ongoing clinical trials with elagolix suggest similar findings, again which are consistent with those noted with other GnRH analogs.  While the significance of these lipid changes in premenopausal women with low-risk baseline lipid values is unknown, further monitoring and evaluation is needed.  In all these studies, the increased lipid values usually occur during the first 1 to 2 months of elagolix use, stabilize or plateau, and return to pretreatment baseline levels within 1 to 3 months after elagolix is discontinued.

Uterine Bleeding in Phase 2 Studies in Uterine Fibroids 
Studies with elagolix have shown that overall, patients on elagolix experienced fewer days 
of bleeding per month, reduced bleeding intensity, and extended intervals between bleeding episodes compared with patients on placebo.  Some subjects experienced periods of oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea with evidence of irregular bleeding as well, in particular at lower doses.  The effect of elagolix on bleeding appeared to be dose-dependent.
Study M12-813 
Preliminary data from Phase 2b uterine fibroid study demonstrates that subjects reported 
no bleeding during the last 90 days on treatment most frequently in the elagolix 300 mg BID alone group and the elagolix 600 mg QD alone group, and reports of no bleeding declined in a dose-dependent fashio n with the addition of E2/NETA. 
Of subjects who received elagolix and we re amenorrheic upon entering the Post-treatment 
Follow-up Period, the majority of subjects (52% in Cohort 1 and 59% in Cohort 2) returned to menses at Month 1, and an additional 42% in Cohort 1 and 38% in Cohort 2 returned to menses at Month 2.
Endometrial Safety in Phase 2 Studies in Uterine Fibroids 
Study M12-813 
Endometrial biopsies were conducted at Baseline and at Month 6 in Study M12-813.  
Preliminary results from Cohort 1 show that, among subjects in elagolix treatment groups, 39% to 43% had normal quiescent/minimally stimulated endometrium and 14% to 28% had normal proliferative endometrium at Month 6.  No clinically significant findings were observed. 
Preliminary results from Cohort 2 are similar.  Among subjects in elagolix treatment 
groups, 21% to 36% had normal quiescent/minimally stimulated endometrium and 20% to 32% had normal proliferative endometrium at Month 6.  No clinically significant findings were observed.

3.2.3 Pregnancy in Elagolix Studies
Pregnancies (Across the Entire Elagolix Clinical Development Program) 
The mechanism of action of elagolix, bleeding pattern, and the indirect evidence for 
follicular escapes (high E2 and progesterone values) indicate that elagolix does not consistently inhibit ovulation and as discussed in Section 3.2.2, Clinical Pharmacokinetic 
and Pharmacodynamic Summary, elagolix is not a contraceptive.
As of 05 February 2016, 172 pregnancies have been reported among women participating 
in elagolix clinical trials, including 104 that occurred off-treatment (58 during Screening and 46 during Post-Treatment [had a conception date more than 30 days after the last dose of study drug]) and 68 On-Treatment (i.e., had conception date during the Treatment Period with study drug or were deemed to have a conception date within 30 days after the last dose of study drug).  Among the 68 on-treatment pregnancies, 21 subjects had no exposure to elagolix (20 subjects treated with placebo only and 1 subject treated with oral contraceptives only).  The remaining 47 on-treatment pregnancies were  in elagolix-treated 
subjects, and 21were carried to term, with 18 subjects delivering live infants without complications (1 pair of twins).  One subject delivered an infant with meconium aspiration pneumonia (MedDRA preferred term = congenital pneumonia).  Two subjects who received 150 mg elagolix QD in Phase 2 endometriosis studies delivered infants with congenital anomalies:  1 infant with tracheoesophageal fistula with findings of patent ductus arteriosus, tricuspid valve incompeten ce, and pneumothorax and 1 infant with cleft 
soft palate.  Internal and external causality assessment of these malformations supported 
that both congenital malformation cases were unlikely to be related to elagolix.
In Phase 3 studies in endometriosis 14 pregnancies have been reported in Study M12-665 
and 6 have been reported in Study M12- 671.  In the aforementioned Phase 2b UF study, 
1 on-treatment pregnancy has been reported.  
Extensive counseling on pregnancy prevent ion along with a requirement for dual

trials.  Women are also counseled on the unknown, thus potential, risk to children born to 
mothers exposed to elagolix during pregnancy, including the possibility of malformations.
Pregnancies must be reported immediately a nd study drug disconti nued.  Information on 
the outcome of the pregnancy will be collected.  For live infant births, information on the 
health of the infant w ill be collected 6 to 12 months after delivery.
Pregnancy outcomes must also be monitored vigilantly across the entire developmentprogram, including adverse events related to pregnancy outcomes.  Women should also be counseled on the unknown, thus potential, risk to children born to mothers exposed to elagolix during pregnancy, including the possibility of malformations.
Efficacy in Phase 2 Uterine Fibroid Studies
The main objectives of the uterine fibroids Phase 2 program in premenopausal women 
were as follows:  1) to select the most appropriate dose(s) of el agolix to evaluate in 
Phase 2b and Phase 3 from both an efficacy and safety perspective, and 2) to assess the need for, adequacy, and type of add-back therapy to be used in conjunction with elagolix.  The first objective was accomplished in the 3-month Phase 2a, dose-ranging POC study, Study M12-663, and the second objective was acco mplished in both Phase 2 studies (need 
for and type of add-back in Phase 2a a nd adequacy of add-back therapy in Phase 2b 
[6-month safety and efficacy study]).  
The Phase 2a dose-finding, POC study evaluated TDDs of elagolix of 200, 400, and 
600 mg in premenopausal women with HMB associated with uterine fibroids.  Wh ile it 
was anticipated that some women would likely benefit (reduction in menstrual bleeding), even with low doses (TDD of 200 mg) of elagolix , the agreed-upon dose selection criteria 
for Phase 2b was predicated on a dose in Phase 2a that provided the most robust response (responder rates of approximately > 80% for the composite bleeding assessment) and an acceptable safety and bleeding profile for the majority of women.  It was known that tosupport long-term dosing with elagolix at th ese higher doses, hormone add back therapy 
would be required for all of these.
Elagolix (ABT-620)
M12-817 Protocol Amendment 2

All elagolix doses resulted in statistically superior reductions in the mean percentage of 
menstrual blood loss (MBL) from baseline measured by the alkaline hematin method compared to placebo, with the largest effect noted with the 300 mg BID dosing regimen.  With regard to the primary endpoint, the add-back therapy with low-dose E2/NETA or cyclical EP ha d marginal effects on the efficacy of elagolix.  Furthermore, 
co-administration of low-dose E2/NETA or cyclical EP (progesterone administered from 
Day 17 through Day 28 per treatment cycle) had comparable efficacy on the percentage 
change in MBL or the percentage of subjects who met the composite bleeding endpoint (MBL volume of < 80 mL at the Final Month [last 28 days of treatment], and≥ 50% 
reduction in MBL volume from Baseline to the Final Month [last 28 days of treatment]) relative to elagolix administration alone.  Wh en co-administered with elagolix (200 or 300 
mg BID), both add-back therapy regimens were efficacious in reducing the percentage of moderate-to-severe bleeding days, with increases in bleeding days being primarily due to spotting.
Based on data from the Phase 2a study, a TDD of 600 mg and 2 doses of E2/NETA add 
back therapy (low-dose E2/NETA and standard-dose E2/NETA) were selected for Phase 2b.
The Phase 2b study evaluated the safety and efficacy of elagolix TDD of 600 mg 
administered either (QD or BID regimens), alone and in combination with 2 different strengths of E2/NETA in premenopausal women age 18 to 51 years with HMB associated 
with uterine fibroids.  The study consisted of an approximate 2.5- to 3.5-month Screening Period, a 6-month Treatment Period, and a 6- month Post-Treatment Follow-Up Period.  
Cohort 1 utilized elagolix 300 mg BID dosing (with and without add-back therapy) while Cohort 2 utilized elagolix 600 mg QD dosing (with and without add-back therapy).  
The primary efficacy endpoint was the per centage of subjects meeting a composite 
endpoint consisting of 2 bleeding assessments:  MBL volume of < 80 mL at the Final 
Month (last 28 days of treatment), and≥ 50% reduction in MBL volume from Baseline to 
the Final Month (last 28 days of treatmen t).  The key secondary efficacy endpoints 
include change in fibroid and uterine volume by ultrasound (and MRI in a subset), other

M12-817 Protocol Amendment 2
43
key bleeding assessments, specific non-bleeding assessments based on a Non-Bleeding 
Symptoms Uterine Fibroid Questionnaire (NBUFSQ), and other QOL variables including UFS-QOL.  The safety and tolerability objectives include the assessment of standard safety parameters, in addition to hypoestrogenic adverse events of interest, including BMD loss as assessed by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and vasomotor 
symptoms, such as hot flush.  Endometrial health via transvaginal ultrasound (TVU) and endometrial biopsy are also evaluated.
Preliminary results from Cohort 1 demonstrated that treatment with elagolix 300 mg BID 
plus E2/NETA showed the following:
●Robust efficacy in controlling HMB (composite bleeding endpoint of 91.9%, 
85.5%, and 79% in the elagolix 300 mg BID alone, elagolix 300 mg BID plus 
low-dose E2/NETA, and elagolix 300 mg BID plus standard-dose E2/NETA treatment groups, respectively) associated with uterine fibroids
●Clinically meaningful improvement in quality of life measures and symptom severity scores as assessed by UFS-QOL
●Mitigation of BMD loss at the lumbar spine, with standard-dose E2/NETA
●Substantial dose-dependent reduction in the incidence of vasomotor symptoms, e.g., hot flushes
●No evidence of endometrial safety concerns
●Overall safety profile remains unchanged, with no new or unexpected findings to date.
Overall, preliminary findings from the Phase 2b study suggest that standard-dose 
E2/NETA as add-back therapy may be effective in preventing BMD loss during treatment with elagolix 300 mg BID, with minimal impact on primary efficacy bleeding endpoints in premenopausal women with HMB associated with uterine fibroids.  This dosing regimen could potentially meet the objective of a long-term therapy for the management 
of symptomatic uterine fibroids in premenopausal women.

Preliminary results from Study M12-813 show that all treatment arms (both doses of 
elagolix [300 mg BID and 600 mg QD] alone or in combination with either strength of E2/NETA) met the primary endpoint, which is the proportion of subjects who achieved an MBL volume of < 80 mL at the Final Month and50% or greater reduction in MBL 
volume from Baseline to the Final Month compared to that of placebo (all P < 0.001), as measured by the alkaline hematin method.
AbbVie Ongoing Phase 3 Clinical Studies
Endometriosis
The Phase 3 endometriosis clinical development program is comprised of two 6-month 
replicate, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pivotal studies (Studies M12-665 and M12-671), each with complimentary 6-mont h safety/efficacy extension studies 
(Studies M12-667 and M12-821).  The extension studies are ongoing.  The primary objective of the pivotal studies are to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy, of elagolix, administered QD or BID compared to placebo, in the management of moderate to severe endometriosis-associated pain while taking into account the use of rescue analgesics.  Secondary efficacy objectives include assessments of other endometriosis-related symptoms, analgesic use, as well as quality of life (QoL) endpoints.  The 6-month 
extension studies assess the long-term safety and efficacy of elagolix for a total treatment duration of up to 12 months.
Phase 3 Clinical Development Program for Uterine Fibroids
The overall objective of the registration clinical development program is to generate 
requisite safety, tolerability, and efficacy data in 2 replicate 6-month Phase 3 pivotal 
studies and 1 safety and efficacy extension study (total 12-month treatment period) to 
support use of elagolix 300 mg BID with E2/NETA (estradiol 1.0 mg/norethindrone acetate 0.5 mg) for the intended indication of the chronic management of HMB associated with uterine fibroids.  Furthermore, the goal is to generate data that supports long-term use with this treatment regimen.
Elagolix (ABT-620)
M12-817 Protocol Amendment 2
45
The primary objective of these pivotal studies is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 
elagolix 300 mg BID in combination with add-back therapy (E2/NETA) as compared to placebo to reduce HMB associated with uterine fibroids.  Given the difficulties with extending placebo for periods beyond 6 months , the elagolix 300 mg BID alone arm 
serves as a reference arm, which will be useful in fully understanding the protective effects of standard dose E2/NETA on BMD over a 12-month treatment period.
Subjects who complete either pivotal study (Studies M12-815 or M12-817) will have the 
option to enter into the extension study (Study M12-816) to receive an additional 
6 months of therapy, for a total of up to 12 months of active treatment for those 
randomized in the pivotal studies to active treatment and a total of 6 months of treatment for those randomized to placebo in the pivotal studies.
Subjects who discontinue or complete treatment in either pivotal study and choose not to 
participate in or are ineligible for entry into the extension study will enter into the 12-month Post-Treatment Follow-Up Period of their respective study.
3.3 Estradiol/Norethindrone Acetate
E2/NETA (1.0 mg E2 and 0.5 mg NETA) is a continuous combined oral 
estrogen/progestin regimen.  E2/NETA is approved in the United States as postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy for the treatment of moderate to severe 
vasomotor symptoms associated with me nopause and the prevention of postmenopausal 
osteoporosis.  E2/NETA is also approved in the United States for the treatment of moderate to severe symptoms of vulvar a nd vaginal atrophy associated with menopause.
3.4 Differences Statement 
Phase 2 studies in women with HMB associated with uterine fibroids demonstrated that 
elagolix 300 mg BID provides the most robust efficacy in reducing HMB and E2/NETA is the optimal regimen for managing and limiti ng BMD loss, such that longer term dosing 
is feasible. 
Elagolix (ABT-620)
M12-817 Protocol Amendment 2
46
Continued assessments of this treatment regimen in the pivotal Phase 3 trials will provide 
the requisite data to support registration of elagolix 300 mg BID + E2/NETA as safe and efficacious treatment for the chronic management of HMB associated with uterine fibroids.  
3.5 Benefits and Risks
The most common symptom of premenopausal  women with uterine fibroids is heavy 
menstrual bleeding (HMB).  A safe and effective chronic pharmacologic therapy for 
symptomatic uterine fibroids, as an alternative to hysterectomy or other surgical intervention, has not yet been approved, which is the objective of the elagolix Phase 3 
clinical development program.  Results from Phase 2 studies in women with HMB associated with uterine fibro ids demonstrated that treatment with elagolix 300 mg BID 
alone and in combination with E2/NETA provided robust efficacy in reducing HMB associated with uterine fibroids.  Importantly, when co-administered with elagolix 300 mg 
BID, E2/NETA (estradiol 1.0 mg/nor ethindrone acetate 0.5 mg) QD mitigated BMD loss 
observed with elagolix 300 mg BID alone and substantially other hypoestrogenic adverse events such as hot flushes.  Also co-administration of elagolix and E2/NETA attenuated increases in serum lipid parameters obse rved with elagolix 300 mg BID alone.  
Furthermore, there was no evidence of endometrial safety concerns and the overall safety profile remained unchanged, with no new or unexpected findings to date.
This therapeutic approach, if successful, could provide an alternative to surgical 
interventions, and/or semi-invasive procedures as a chronic pharmacologic treatment for HMB associated with uterine fibroids.  Based on the totality of data to date from the Phase 2 clinical development program, the overall benefit/risk profile of elagolix 300 mg BID with E2/NETA appears to be favorable for the chronic management of HMB associated with uterine fibro ids, and will be further defined in this Phase 3 trial.
4.0 Study Objective
The objectives of this study are to:

47
●Assess the efficacy, safetyand tolerability of elagolix 300 mg BID in 
combination with E2/NETA (estradiol 1.0 mg/norethindrone acetate 0.5 mg 
QD), versus placebo to reduce HMB associated with uterine fibroids in premenopausal women 18 to 51 years of age.  
●The study will also characterize the impact of E2/NETA on the safety/tolerability (including BMD and other hypoestrogenic side effects) and 
efficacy of elagolix.
5.0 Investigational Plan
5.1 Overall Study Design and Plan:  Description
This Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, multicenter, pl acebo-cont rolled study is designed 
to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability  of elagolix alone and in combination with 
E2/NETA in the management of premenopausal women with HMB associated with 
uterine fibroids.  Approximately 400 subjects will be randomized in a 1:1:2 ratio to 1 of the following 3 treatment groups:
●placebo (n = 100)
●elagolix 300 mg BID (n = 100)
●elagolix 300 mg BID plus E2/NETA (estradiol 1.0 mg/norethindrone acetate 
0.5 mg) QD (n = 200)
This study is designed to enroll approximately 400 subjects across approximately 
125 clinical study sites to meet scientific and regulatory objectives without enrolling an undue number of subjects in alignment with ethical considerations.  If the target number of enrolled subjects has been met, there is a possibility that additional subjects in screening will not be enrolled.
The study consists of 4 periods as follows:  
1. Washout Period prior to Screening (if applicable)
Elagolix (ABT-620)
M12-817 Protocol Amendment 2
48
2. Screening Period of approximately 2.5 to 3.5 months prior to first dose of study 
drug
3. 6-month Treatment Period 
4. 12-month Post-Treatment Follow-Up Peri od (OR Subjects may enter an extension 
study [Study M12-816] if they are willing and qualify, based on safety parameters, 
to receive an additional 6 months of treatment, followed by 12 months of follow-up).
Subjects will visit the site for assessments and testing during the Washout Period, if applicable, during the Screening Period (Initial Screening Visit, Screening Product Collection Visits [PCVs] for assessment of menstrual blood loss) and Treatment Period 
(Day 1 [Randomization] and monthly during Month 1 through Month 6).  Following the 6-month Treatment Period, subjects will enter into a 12-month Post-Treatment Follow-Up Period or an extension study.  The Study Periods are illustrated in Figure 1 .
Figure 1. Study Schematic
Washout Period
Following informed consent, subjects, who are taking or were taking exclusionary 
medications such as hormonal medications or an tifibrinolytics, prior to screening that 
require washout, must enter a Washout Period.  Subjects must complete the Washout 

Elagolix (ABT-620)
M12-817 Protocol Amendment 2
49
Period and have had at least 1 menses after completion of washout, prior to entering the 
Screening Period.  The duration of the required washout period is based on the excluded medication that the subject is currently taking, or was taking.  The requirements for washout are provided in detail in Section 5.2.3.1, Prior Hormonal/Anti-Hormonal 
Medications and the assessments to be performed are specified in Appendix C , Study 
Activities.
A pelvic ultrasound (transabdominal [TAU] and transvaginal [TVU]) may be performed 
after informed consent is obtained and pri or to a subject entering the Washout Period in 
order to establish the presence of a qualifying fibroid(s) or uterine volume to avoid the subject unnecessarily undergoing a lengthy washout of hormonal medications.  Subjects will begin the use of non- hormonal dual contraception and receive counseling on the 
importance of consistent, appropriate and effective use of birth control.  
Screening Period
Subjects who do not require washout will enter directly into the approximate 2.5- to 
3.5-month Screening Period and will provide written informed consent before any study-related procedures are performed.  Subjects will undergo screening procedures (e.g., safety labs, pelvic ultrasound [TAU/TVU], DXA) as specified in Appendix C , Study 
Activities, to establish eligibility based on inclusion and exclusion criteria.  
Subjects will be required to use dual non-hormonal contraception and will receive 
counseling on the importance of consistent, appropriate and effective use of birth control throughout the Screening Period.  
A pelvic ultrasound (TAU and TVU) will be performed, if not performed in the Washout 
Period, to determine the presence and size of qualifying uterine fibroids and uterine volume and to rule out exclusionary criteria; in addition to the ultrasound, a saline infusion sonohyste rography (SIS) will be conducted to rule out exclusionary 
gynecological disorders such as intracav itary submucosal pedunc ulated fibroids and 
endometrial polyps. 
Elagolix (ABT-620)
M12-817 Protocol Amendment 2
50
Subjects who have qualifying uterine fibroids and uterine volume as assessed by 
ultrasound; however, have SIS images which are unable to fully assess the endometrial cavity, may undergo additional imaging modalities  such as MRI for further evaluation in 
Screening.
Eligibility based on MBL (> 80 mL for each of 2 menstrual cycles) will be established 
using the alkaline hematin method.  Sanitary products and sanitary product collection kits will be dispensed during screening and training will be provided to ensure collection of sanitary products for menstrual bleeding assessment at the start of the subject's first menses in the Screening Period (Screening Menstrual Cycle 1).  Subjects will be required to collect all used or worn sanitary products (including products with no visible blood on them) on days with menstrual bleeding or spotting over the course of 2 or 3 menstrual cycles during Screening to determine eligibility for entry into the Treatment Period.  Sanitary products will be returned to  the site within approximately 5 days after 
cessation of menses for each menstrual cycle at a Screening Product Collection Visit.  
Reminders regarding the consistent use of acceptable forms of dual non-hormonal birth 
control and collection of all used or worn sanitary products on days with bleeding or 
spotting will be provided on a routine basis by the Study Staff.Subjects who screen fail may be re-screened into the Study M12-817 on a case-by-case 
basis after consulting the AbbVie TA MD for approval.
Additionally, for subjects who underwent screening in the replicate pivotal 
StudyM12-815 study who were not Randomized due to enrollment closure in that study, may have an opportunity to transfer to the Study M12-817 with TA MD approval.  Tests and procedures conducted in Study M12-815 will be transferred with the subject to StudyM12-817 for the subject's continued participation in screening and will be used for eligibility to be Randomized into Study M12- 817 without needing to repeat procedures 
unless otherwise indicated.

Screening Sanitary Product Collection Visits
At each Screening Product Collection Visit, sanitary products to measure menstrual blood 
loss will be collected and a venous blood sample will be obtained.  The site will submit the sanitary products and venous blood sample to the alkaline hematin laboratory for analysis of blood loss to determine eligibility. 
Vital signs, a urine pregnancy test, contraception counseling and adverse event and 
concomitant medication review will also be performed during these visits.  Additional sanitary collection kits and contraceptives will be dispensed at each visit.  
There may be an option for subjects to ha ve a Product Collection Visit conducted at home 
by a Home Health Care Agent who will go to the Subject's home to draw a venous blood 
sample and retrieve the collectio n keg to return to the site.
Treatment Period
The Treatment Period begins with Day 1, which will occur between Days 1 to 10 of the first day of menses (defined as the first day with full menstrual flow) for all subjects who meet eligibility criteria during the Screening Period.  
Subjects will be randomized to receive either placebo (n = 100), elagolix 300 mg BID 
(n = 100) or elagolix 300 mg BID plus E2/NETA QD (n = 200).  The first dose of study drug will be administered at the study site on Day 1.  Subjects will be instructed to 
self-administer study medication or matching placebo twice daily (in the morning and in 
the evening approximately 12 hours apart) orally without regard to food throughout the 6-Month Treatment Period.  Subjects randomized into the study will visit the site during the 6-Month Treatment Period on Day 1, a nd then monthly (28-day intervals) from 
Month 1 through Month 6.  Additional study visits may occur, either for subjects returning their sanitary products for analysis of alkaline hematin at a Product Collection Visit or for a Premature Discontinuation Visit (if applicable).
Elagolix (ABT-620)
M12-817 Protocol Amendment 2
52
Pregnancy (urine and/or serum) tests will be performed at each visit throughout the study 
and subjects will be counseled at each visit on appropriate and effective forms of dual non-hormonal contraception to promote pregnancy prevention. 
Sanitary product collection kits will continue to be dispensed at all Treatment Period 
visits.  Subjects will be required to collect all sanitary products on days with menstrual 
bleeding or spotting throughout the Treatment Period.  Subjects will return sanitary products to the clinical study site, either during a scheduled monthly visit or at a Product 
Collection Visit.  As in Screen ing, there may be an option for subjects to have a Product 
Collection Visit conducted at home by a Home Health Care Agent.  
If a Subject does not return a sanitary product co llection keg at any site visit (scheduled 
monthly visit, Product Collection Visit or Unscheduled Visit) during the Treatment Period, the Uterine Bleeding Questionnaire (UBQ) will be administered by the Site Staff to indicate if the subject had any bleeding or spotting since the last study visit.  If the subject had bleeding or spotting, she will be asked why she did not return a sanitary product collection keg.  The subject's responses will be recorded on the UBQ by the Site Staff.
A pelvic ultrasound (TAU and TVU) will be performed during the Treatment Period as 
outlined in Appendix C .  
An MRI will be performed at Day 1, unless performed during Screening, and at subsequent time points as outlined in Appendix C for subjects who consent to participate 
in the MRI subset.
Subjects will continue the use of dual non-hormonal contraception and receive counseling 
on the importance of consistent,  appropriate and effect ive use of birth control.  Subjects 
who prematurely discontinue from the Treatmen t Period will be asked to complete 
Premature Discontinuation procedures and en ter the Post-Treatment Follow-Up Period.  
Premature Discontinuation Procedures will be performed as specified in Appendix C , 
Study Activities.  
Elagolix (ABT-620)
M12-817 Protocol Amendment 2
53
Eligible subjects who complete the 6-month Treatment Peri od, qualify an d provide 
informed consent will be allowed to participate in a 6-month extension study in which all 
subjects will receive active treatment with either elagolix 300 mg BID alone or elagolix 300 mg BID plus E2/NETA.  All activities for th ese subjects are outlined in the extension 
study protocol (Study M12-816).  The Month 6 Treatment Visit in this study may be conducted over several days to allow for eligibility to be confirmed prior to participation in the extension study.
Post-Treatment Follow-Up Period
For subjects entering the 12-month Post-Treatment Follow-Up Peri od, visits will occur 
either by phone or on-site from Months 1 through 12.  
During the phone visits, site personnel will discuss adverse events, concomitant 
medications, if applicable, obtain the results of the subject's self-administered urine pregnancy test and will remind subjects of the importance of consistent use of appropriate and effective dual non -hormonal contraception throughout the Post-Tr eatment Follow-Up 
Period.  Subjects may begin taking hormon al contraceptive preparations only after 
completing the Post-Treatment Follow-Up Month 2 Visit and having returned sanitary 
products for a full menses (menses with full menstrual flow) in the Post-Treatment Follow-up Period.  If the subject's full menses has not returned by the Post-Treatment Follow-Up Month 2 Visit, an adverse event of amenorrhea should be documented.
During the on-site visits, Post-Treatment Month 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12, procedures will be 
performed as specified in Appendix C , Study Activities.
Subjects will be required to collect sanitary products for their first menses with full 
menstrual flow in the Post-Treatment Follow-up Period.  If the subject misses co llecting 
sanitary products for her first full menses, she will be required to collect sanitary products for her next full menses.  Subjects will return the sanitary products at a Product Collection Visit within approximately 5 days after cessation of bleeding or spotting.  The Post-Treatment UBQ will be administered by Site Staff at each Phone or Site Visit until the 
Elagolix (ABT-620)
M12-817 Protocol Amendment 2
54
subject has returned sanitary products from her one full menses in the Post-Treatment 
Follow-up Period.  Once a subject returns sanitary products from a full menses in the 
Post-Treatment Follow-up Period, the Post-Treatment UBQ no longer needs to be completed.
Subjects who prematurely discontinued from the Treatment Period prior to the Month 3 
Study Visit, (e.g., subjects who received < 3 months of study drug), will enter into the 
Post-Treatment Follow-Up Period, however, the number of procedures/assessments performed in the Post-Treatment Period will be reduced and these subjects will complete the study at the Post-Treatment Follow-up Month 6 visit (unless the reason for premature discontinuation was due to BMD decrease or an adverse event of fracture).  Procedures/assessments should be performed as specified in Appendix C , Study 
Activities.
Unscheduled Visit and Unscheduled Visits for Delays in Roll-Over
In the event an Unscheduled Visit is necessary during the Treatment or Post-Treatment 
Follow-Up Period, the site will perform at minimum, the UBQ and an assessment of 
adverse events and concomitant medications.  Unscheduled visits should be limited to 
when a subject is required to return to the office or off-site facility to repeat a procedure or 
to conduct a procedure to assess safety and the visit is not occurring at the same time when other study related procedures are scheduled to occur.  For unscheduled visits when study drug is di spensed (e.g., to replenish lost or damaged study drug), the subject will
also be required to have a negative urine pregnancy test result prior to dispensing.  Clinical judgment should dictate when other safety assessments (such as vital signs and/or symptom-directed physical ex amination) should be conducted and should also support the 
reason for the unscheduled visit.
Subjects awaiting test results to determine eligibility into the extension study may be 
required to remain in the Treatment Period to receive additional study drug until results 
become available.  Visits associated with th is waiting period will be documented as 
Unscheduled Visits and subjects will continue to undergo study-related assessments and

procedures as outlined in Appendix C and Section 5.4.4Delays in Rollover into the 
Extension Study.
Visit Windows
Visit windows will be allowed for the monthly visits during the Treatment and 
Post-Treatment Follow-Up Periods.  Each subsequent monthly visit should be scheduled based on the date of the Day 1 (Randomization) visit.  At the Month 6 Treatment Period Visit, a –4 or +6 day visit window will be allowed in order to collect sanitary products from the last episode of menstrual bleeding or spotting prior to the Month 6 visit if menstrual bleeding starts immediately prior to or coincides with the scheduled visit.  The subject will be instructed to continue taking study drug from the extra blister card until she returns for the Month 6 visit.
Specific assessment-related visit wi ndows are allowed.  Please refer to Table 1, Visit and 
Assessment Windows, for assessment-specific visit windows.

premenopausal women with HMB associated with uterine fibroids.  
(prognostic and predictive)
6, 7 The impact of elagolix on pregnancies or breastfed infants is unknown and 
there is a possible risk of miscarriage due to changes in hormone levels; 
therefore, these criteria ensure pregnant women are not enrolled into the study and adequate precautions are taken to avoid pregnancy during study participation.  (prognostic and risk)

Rationale for Exclusion Criteria: 
1 – 4, 24 These criteria were selected to ensure an adequate subject 
population of women with HMB and uterine fibroids and no 
clinically significant gynecological disorders.  (prognostic and 
predictive)
5 – 13, 15 – 23, 
29, 30These are standard criteria to ensure general good health and the safety of the subjects.  (prognostic and risk)

14 The impact of elagolix on pregnancies or breastfed infants is 
unknown and there is a possible risk of miscarriage due to changes 
in hormone levels; therefore, these criteria ensure adequate 
precautions are taken to avoid pregnancy or breastfeeding while receiving elagolix.  (risk)
31, 32 This criterion was selected to avoid bias for the evaluation of 
efficacy and safety by prior participation in an elagolix study.  (predictive and risk)
25 – 28 These criteria were selected to ensure that efficacy can be 
adequately assessed.  (predictive and risk)
33 This criterion was added to ensure the population of subjects 
enrolled will comply with study -related procedures and subject 
collection requirements throughout the entire study.  (predictive)
5.2.3 Prior and Concomitant Therapy
Any medication administered to treat uterine fibroid symptoms or HMB associated with 
uterine fibroids within 6 months prior to Washout or Screening must be recorded in source documents and the electronic case report forms (eCRFs).  The date(s) of administration (including start and stop dates), dose, route, and reason for use and discontinuation must be recorded in source documents and on the Prior Uterine Fibroid Medication eCRFs.  
Please refer to Section 5.2.3.2for details regarding concomitant medication use.
The AbbVie Therapeutic Area Medical Director (TA MD) should be contacted if there are 
any questions regarding concomitant or prior therapy.
5.2.3.1 Prior Hormonal/Anti-Hormonal Medications
Subjects using or who have used hormonal contraception or other 
hormonal/anti-hormonal therapies may be c onsidered for study participation provided 
they complete the required washout.  Subjects must also return to 1 menses after completion of Washout before entering into the Screening Period.  Subjects currently 
Elagolix (ABT-620)
M12-817 Protocol Amendment 2
65
using hormonal/anti-hormonal therapies will sign an ICF before they discontinue the 
hormonal med ication.  Subjects who discontinued taking hormonal contraception or other 
hormonal/anti-hormonal therapies before they we re approached to participate in the study 
must sign the ICF and complete the remainder of the required washout.  Subjects must also return to 1 menses after completion of Washout before the Screening Period can begin.  Discontinuation of hormonal contraception should be done according to prescribing information (e.g., complete cu rrent cycle of birth control pills).  
The minimum washout intervals for hormonal medications (including LNG-IUS) prior to Screening are described in Table 2.  Subjects entering washout will be required to undergo 
study specific procedures, as outlined in Appendix C , Study Activities.  Subjects may 
enter the Screening Period provided they have returned to 1 menses after the required washout period has been completed.  Subjects who have a CU-IUD and agree to have the CU-IUD removed may enter screening, however the subject must return to 1 menses after removal of the CU-IUD, prior to collecting sanitary products for assessment of menstrual blood loss as the removal of the CU-IUD may cause abnormal menstrual bleeding that may interfere with the assessment of eligibility criteria.  
If the type of hormonal produ ct and the length of Washout Period are not listed in the 
table below, consult the AbbVie TA MD.

** This is the minimum washout; however, subjects may not enter Screening until at least 1 menses (or at least 
2 menses for Medroxyprogesterone acetate injection) has occurred after completion of the Washout Period.  If less 
than a full course of therapy is administered, the investigator should contact the AbbVie TA MD listed in Section6.1.5to discuss and confirm the required washout interval.
5.2.3.2 Concomitant Therapy
All other medications or vaccines (including over-the-counter or prescription medicines, 
vitamins and/or herbal supplements) that the subject is receiving at the time of entering 
Elagolix (ABT-620)
M12-817 Protocol Amendment 2
67
into the Washout Period (if required) or Screening Period and during the Treatment and 
Post-Treatment Follow-Up Periods must be recorded in source documents and on the Concomitant Medication eCRFs.  The reason for use, date(s) of administration (including start and end dates) and dosage information (including dose and frequency) must be recorded.
5.2.3.3 Iron Supplementation
Excessive blood loss from heavy menses may result in iron deficiency anemia.  Iron 
deficiency anemia is defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) as an Hgb concentration below 12 g/dL (120 g/L) for non-pregnant women.  Subjects entering the study with anemia or who develop anemia durin g the study, if not already taking iron 
supplements, should be prescribed iron supplementation by the Investigator, as per standard of care.  If the Investigator does not prescribe iron supplements for subjects with a Hgb < 12g/dL, the reason should be documented in source documents.
The recommended oral dose of ferrous sulfate is 300 to 325 mg following the diagnosis of 
anemia.  During Screening, all subjects with an Hgb level < 8 g/dL will be retested after receiving iron supplements; these subjects will only be eligible to randomize if their Hgb results meet eligibility prior to Day 1 (Randomization) and has not required a blood transfusion within 60 days prior to Day 1.  If a subject is unable to tolerate ferrous sulfate 
then ferrous gluconate, liquid iron or intravenous (IV) iron may be prescribed.  If subjects experience constipation from iron supplement use, stool softeners may be prescribed.  All iron supplements taken during the study, from Screening through the final visit, must be recorded on the concomitant medications eCRF.
Further instructions on the provision of iron supplementation and stool softeners will be 
provided sepa rately from this protocol.
5.2.3.4 Concomitant Use of Corticosteroids
Chronic use (> 14 days) of systemic corticosteroids is prohibited during the Washout, 
Screening, Treatment and Post-Treatment Follow-Up Periods, however inhaled

M12-817 Protocol Amendment 2
68
corticosteroids for the treatment of asthma are permitted.  Over-the-counter and 
prescription topical, inhaled, intranasal or injectable (for occasional use) corticosteroids are allowed.  Subjects, who based on medical history, may potentially require long-term oral treatment with corticosteroids during th e course of the study, should not be enro lled.  
If the subject requires systemic corticosteroid use for > 14 days, the AbbVie TA MD must be notified.
5.2.3.5 Prohibited Therapy
All hormonal forms of birth control (e xcept the emergency contraceptive pill, 
levonorgestrel 1.5 mg [such as Plan B
®], or ulipristal acetate 30 mg [such as Ella®or 
EllaOne®]) are prohibited during the Washout, Screening; Treatment Period and until the 
Post-Treatment Follow-Up Month 2 Visit and r eturn to menses.  If the Subject has not 
returned to menses, she must continue  the use of dual non- hormonal contraception.
For subjects who are prescribed/administered the emergency contraceptive pill during the 
study, the AbbVie TA MD must be informed.
Tranexamic acid should not be taken during the Screening, Treatment or Post-Treatment 
Follow-Up Period, however tranexamic acid, if necessary, can be prescribed following completion of the Post-Treatment Follow-up Month 2 visit and the subject has returned to first full menses.
Due to the extensive list of herbal remedies and supplements, please contact the AbbVie 
TA MD for any that may be prohibited.  Generally-speaking, any supplements or herbal remedies used to treat premenstrual or gynecological problems, such as black cohosh, are excluded.

Month 2 Visit and return to menses.  Tranexamic acid, if necessary can be prescribed following completion of the 
Post-Treatment Follow-up Month 2 visit and the subject has returned to first full menses.
If a prohibited medication is necessary to treat an adverse event or a pre-existing 
condition other than uterine fibroids, the AbbVie TA MD noted in Section 6.1.5should be 
consulted; however, if clinically required and to prevent an immediate hazard to the subject being treated, the AbbVie TA MD should be notified as soon as possible after the start of use.  Additionally, if a subject takes a prohibited medication during the study, except as permitted per protocol (hormonal medication taken after completion of the Post-Treatment Follow-Up Month 2 Visit and return to menses), her continued

there are any questions regarding prior or c oncomitant therapy, please contact your Study 
Monitor.
5.2.4 Contraception Recommendations and Pregnancy Testing
Contraception Counseling/Dispense Contraceptives
Investigators and Study Coordinators will be trained by the Sponsor on the importance of 
contraception in this clinical trial.  Subjects (excluding those subjects who have had a bilateral tubal ligation or bilateral tubal occlusion) w ill be counseled at every visit 
throughout their participation in the study on the importance of pregnancy prevention and the use of appropriate and effective methods of birth control during the Washout Period, if applicable, during the Screening, Treatment, and Post-Treatment Follow-Up Periods of the study.  
Subjects must agree to use two forms of non-hormonal contraception (dual contraception) 
consistently throughout the Washout (if applicable), Screening and Treatment Periods and 
Post-Treatment Follow-Up Periods (Subjects may begin the use of hormonal contraception (e.g., oral or IUD) after completing the Post-Treatment Follow-up Month 2 Visit and after return to first full mense s in the Post-Treatmen t Follow-up Period).  
Subjects using an LNG-IUS, who agree to have the LNG-IUS removed must complete 
washout per Section 5.2.3.1, and return to 1 menses after completion of washout prior to 
Screening.  Subjects using a CU-IUD, who agree to have the IUD removed may enter screening, however the subject must return to at least 1 menses after removal of the CU-IUD prior to collecting sanitary products for assessment of menstrual blood loss as the removal of the CU-IUD may cause abnormal menstrual bleeding that may interfere with 
the assessment of eligibility criteria.  
Acceptable methods of dual non-hormonal contraception include the following 
combinations:
Elagolix (ABT-620)
M12-817 Protocol Amendment 2
72
●Condom with spermicide (foam, gel or polymer film)
●Diaphragm with spermicide (condom may or may not be used)
●Cervical cap with spermicide (condom may or may not be used)
Subjects are not required to use dual contraception methods if:
●Sexual partner(s) is vasectomized at least 6 months prior to screening
●Subject practices total abstinence from sexual intercourse, as the preferred 
lifestyle of the subject; periodic abstinence is not acceptable
●Subject had a bilateral tubal occlusion (including ligation and blockage 
methods such as Essure®) at least 4 months prior to screening.  
●Subject is not sexually active with men; periodic sexual relationship(s) with men requires the use of dual non- hormonal contraception as indicated above.
Subjects may begin the use of hormonal contraception in place of dual non- hormonal 
contraception during the Post-Treatment Follow-up Period if they meet both of the 
following: 
●Completed the Post-Treatment Follow-up Month 2 Visit
●Returned to first full menses in the Post-Treatment Follow-up Period
If subject does not return to full menses she must continue use of dual non-hormonal contraception.
The following measures will be taken to help ensure pregnancy prevention during the 
study.
1. The informed consent form will include an attestation requiring the subject to 
confirm in writing her full awarene ss that the potential risks of study drug 
(elagolix) on the unborn child are unknown and therefore she must not get pregnant during the entire time of study participation, and that she agrees to consistently use dual non-hormonal contracep tion throughout her study participation (during the 
Elagolix (ABT-620)
M12-817 Protocol Amendment 2
73
Washout Period, if applicable, Screening, Treatment and Post-Treatment Follow-
Up Period.
2. The investigator or designated study staff will counsel the subject that the study 
drug is not contraceptive, that ovulation may occur even though the study drug may 
have altered menstrual cyclicity, and that fetal abnormalities have been observed in women who have received elagolix in clinical studies that were not deemed to be related to elagolix based on the totalit y of data; however, it is unknown whether 
these abnormalities were the result of taking elagolix.
3. The Sponsor will provide training materials to the sites for instructing subjects on 
the types of protocol-allowed contracepti on methods, their effectiveness and proper 
use.
●The Sponsor will provide sites with a supply of materials to promote 
pregnancy prevention, including contraceptives (condoms and spermicides), 
and lubricants to provide to subjects at no charge.  Subjects should only use the pregnancy prevention materials provided by the Sponsor as these products 
have undergone analytical testing by the analytical lab to confirm there is no or 
limited interference with the alkaline hematin method.
●Subjects will be allowed to choose a contraception method of their choice from the contraceptives provided by the Sponsor and practice the allowable methods of dual contraception.  The site will a ssess the subject's basic understanding of 
the proper use through discussion and demonstration of proper techniques, including proper diaphragm use.
●The site will dispense contraceptives to subjects throughout Washout, if applicable, Screening, Treatment, and through the Post-Treatment Follow-Up, 
as needed.  Subjects may begin the use of hormonal medication after 
completion of the Post Treatment Follow-up Month 2 visit and return to first 
full menses.
●The source documents will capture date contraception counseling was performed, whether the subject is sexu ally active with men, the type of 
contraceptive used, a change in contraceptive method, use of a non-study 
Elagolix (ABT-620)
M12-817 Protocol Amendment 2
74
supply brand, contraceptives provided to the subject, and the date supplies 
were provided.
●As appropriate, the subject will be asked to attest by signature at the time of consent, and in a stand-alone attestation form at Day 1 and at the Month 6 or 
Premature Discontinuation study visit that allowable methods of contraception, 
as described during the pregnancy prevention counseling, are being practiced.
●For subjects who have had a bilateral tubal occlusion, attestation is only 
required to be collected once at the time of consent.
4. Subjects will be reminded to use dual non-hormonal contraception.
5. The study drug will be dispensed as a monthly supply at the beginning of each 
month during the Treatment Period to promote frequent interaction with site staff 
and opportunities for continued education.
6. At each visit, subjects will be asked to name the type of contraception used since 
their last visit and will be reminded of the proper use of that type of method to prevent ineffective contraception and the risk of unexpected pregnancy due to unprotected sexual activity.
Pregnancy Tests and Reporting a Pregnancy
Urine and/or serum pregnancy tests will be performed as specified in Appendix C , in all 
subjects regardless of sexual activity status or method of contraception.  The subject must have a confirmed negative urine pregnancy test within 24 hours prior to performing the SIS and endometrial biopsy procedures.
The urine pregnancy test result on Day 1 must be reviewed and determined to be negative 
prior to randomization.  In addition, during the Treatment Period, the urine pregnancy test 
must be negative prior to providing subjects with their next monthly supply of study drug, (including an unscheduled visit at which study drug is dispensed).
Home pregnancy test kits will be provided to the subject at the Initial Screening Visit and 
Month 6 or Premature Discontinuation visit during the Treatment Period if logistically, a 
Elagolix (ABT-620)
M12-817 Protocol Amendment 2
75
urine pregnancy test cannot be performed at the study site or other medical facility within 
24 hours prior to an SIS and/or endometrial biopsy.  The subject must self-administer and report a negative urine pregnancy test result to the site within 24 hours prior to undergoing these procedures.
A positive urine pregnancy test result must be confirmed with a quantitative serum 
pregnancy test.  The subject should temporarily discontinue study drug administration while waiting for the results of the serum pregnancy test.  If a serum pregnancy test result is positive at any time during the Treatment Period, the site will immediately inform the subject to discontinue study drug (Section 6.1.6).  If a subject is confirmed as pregnant, 
the subject will be prematurely discontinued from the study. 
An ultrasound examination will be performed dur ing the first trimester of pregnancy to 
assess the gestational age and estimated date of delivery if the subject becomes pregnant 
during the Treatment or Post-Treatment Follow-Up Periods of the study.  Refer to Section6.1.6for instructions on reporting of a pregnancy to the Sponsor and the required 
follow-up on the subject/fetus and live infant births.
5.3 Efficacy, Pharmacokinetic, Pharmacodynamic, 
Pharmacogenetic and Safety Assessments/Variables
5.3.1 Efficacy and Safety Measurements Assessed and Flow 
Chart
Study procedures during the Washout (if applicable), Screening, Treatment and 
Post-Treatment Follow-Up Periods described in this protocol are summarized in Appendix C .
5.3.1.1 Study Procedures
The study procedures outlined in Appendix C are discussed in detail in this section, with 
the exception of the monitoring of study drug accountability (Section 5.5.7) and the 
collection of concomitant medication and adverse event information (Section 5.2.3and 
Elagolix (ABT-620)
M12-817 Protocol Amendment 2
76
Section 6.1, respectively).  Study data will be recorded in source documents and on 
eCRFs.
The Screening Period will occur within  approximately 2.5 to 3.5 months prior to 
administration of the first dose of study drug on Day 1 (randomization).  For procedures 
performed during the Screening Period and subsequently repeated, the procedure performed closest to dosing will serve as a baseline for clinical assessment. 
Study procedures during the Treatment and Post-Treatment Follow-Up Periods may be 
performed within the visit windows specified in Table 1.  Scheduled monthly visits during 
the Treatment and Post-Treatment Follow-Up Period are based on a 28-day month.
It is recommended that the pelvic ultrasound, MRI (if applicable), DXA scan and 
endometrial biopsy for the Month 6 Visit be conducted within approximately 15 days prior to the scheduled Month 6 Visit to ensure the images are received and acceptable for review by the central vendor.  If eligibility in to the extension study cannot be determined 
at the pivotal study Month 6 visit, an additi onal study drug kit will be dispensed to the 
subject at the Month 6 Visit.  Refer to Section 5.4.4, Delays in Roll-Over for the 
Extension Study for further instructions.
This protocol provides recommendations regarding the sequence of procedures to be 
performed during the study.  In no case should these recommendations outweigh clinical judgment or standard of care.  If the protocol indicates that the AbbVie TA MD is to be contacted prior to performing a procedure, yet the timing of the request would either interrupt a procedure or would interfere with standard of care and clinical judgment, then clinical judgment should prevailand the AbbVie TA MD should be notified afterwards.  
Due to the long Screening Period, eligibility should be assessed throughout the Screening 
Period, including just prior to randomization to ensure that the subject continues to meet 
eligibility and that the results from all screening procedures are available prior to randomization.

Informed Consent
The IRB/IEC approved informed consent will be signed by the subject before beginning 
any study-specific procedures or discontinuing any hormonal contraception/therapies or other prohibited medications.  Pharmacogenetic (PG) testing is optional and a subject must be provided a separate informed consent form for this blood collection.  Details about how informed consent will be obtained and documented are provided in Section 9.3.
Screen Failures and Re-Screening of Subjects
Subjects who have signed informed consent and did not randomize because they either did not complete the Washout Period (if applicable), did not complete the study-specific procedures during the Screening Period (e.g., TAU/TVU or endometrial biopsy) or did not meet all entry criteria will be considered Screen Failures.  The reason(s) for screen failure will be recorded in the source documents and will be captured in the eCRF.  Subjects who screen fail may be re-screened on a case-by-case basis after consulting the AbbVie TA MD for approval.
Medical/Social History
The following information will be collected after signing the informed consent, either 
during the Washout Period (if applicable) or during the Screening Period for those subjects who do not require washout.
●Complete medical history, including documentation of any clin ically 
significant medical conditions and medications
●History of tobacco and alcohol use
The medical history will be reviewed a nd updated prior to dosing on Study Day 1 
(Randomization) and w ill serve as the baseline for clinical assessment.

The gynecological/obstetrical and uterine fibroid history will be reviewed and updated 
prior to dosing on Study Day 1 (Randomization) and will serve as the baseline for clinical assessment.
Gynecological (Pelvic and Breast) Examination
A complete breast, and pelvic examination, including external genitalia will be performed 
during the Screening Period and at the Month 6 or Premature Discontinuation visit in the Treatment Period.  A screening breast examination may be omitted, based on local or country guidelines, e.g., breast examinations are routinely or only conducted by breast specialists.  In these cases, source documentation should indicate reason not performed.
Pap Test
A Pap test will be performed in subjects ≥ 21 years of age during the Screening Period, 
using the Thin Prep®Pap Test™ provided and analyzed by the central laboratory.  If the 
subject is experiencing menstrual bleeding that precludes the performance of the Pap test, 
this procedure should be performed as soon as possible after the menstrual bleeding has ended.  In the case of an unsatisfactory sample, the Pap test can be repeated.  The repeat Pap test should also be performed when the subject is not experiencing menstrual bleeding.  In order to be enrolled in the study, the Pap test must meet eligibility requirements as outlined in Figure 2 , Pap Test Eligibility. 
Subjects age 25 – 51 years old, with the Pa p diagnosis of ASC-US (atypical squamous 
cells of undetermined significance) with high risk human pap illomavirus (HPV), or 
low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) and those > 30 years of age with negative (NILM) but absent or insufficient endocervical/transformational zone component will have reflex HPV testing as outlined in Figure 2 .  Those with high risk HPV, LSIL 
with high risk HPV or LSIL negative for HPV, or subjects > 30 years of age with Negative Intraepithelial Lesion or Malignancy (N ILM) but with negative or absent 
endocervical or transformation zone component with high risk HPV will undergo additional evaluation as outlined in Figure 2 with colposcopy and biopsy, if applicable per 
local guidelines or standard of care.

Endometrial Biopsy
Instructions on endometrial biopsy collection and processing procedures for shipping will 
be provided by the central laboratory.  Sites can either use the endometrial biopsy instruments provided by the Central Lab or  any other endometrial biopsy instruments 
available at the study site.  Subjects must have a confirmed negative urine pregnancy test within 24 hours prior to undergoing the endometrial biopsy.  
Pre-medication for the endometrial biopsy proce dure is allowable and should be recorded 
in source documents and on the appropriate eCRF.  Misoprostol for cervical dilatation is 
allowable.  An office hysteroscopy may be performed to obtain the endometrial biopsy sample if the endometrial biopsy cannot be performed because of anatomical reasons.  
During the Screening Period, an endometrial biopsy will be performed in all subjects.If the endometrial biopsy is performed on the same day as the Pap smear or pelvic 
ultrasound, the endometrial biopsy should be performed after the Pap smear and pelvic ultrasound.
Biopsy results must be obtained before the subject can be randomized.  In case of an 
insufficient sample the biopsy may be repeated; however, results must be available prior to randomization.  Subjects must have an adequate endometrial biopsy, (i.e., results show no endometrial pathology to be eligible for randomization).
If an abnormal finding such as endometritis, hyperplasia (with or without atypia) or 
endometrial cancer is reported, subjects will not be eligible for randomization into the study.  If the Investigator determines that an abnormal finding can be treated outside of the protocol, the AbbVie TA MD must be contacted to obtain approval to perform a repeat biopsy.  The repeat biopsy must meet eligibility criteria prior to Study Day 1 (Randomization).
During the Treatment Period, an endometrial biopsy will be performed at Month 6 visit or 
at the Premature Discontinuation visit (if subject prematurely discontinues after the 
Elagolix (ABT-620)
M12-817 Protocol Amendment 2
82
Month 3 Visit).  It is recommended that the biopsy for the Month 6 Visit is performed 
approximately 15 days prior to the scheduled Month 6 visit to ensure the results are received from the central laboratory in order to  determine eligibility for inclusion into the 
extension study.  If biopsy results are not available by the Month 6 visit of the Treatment Period, refer to Section 5.4.4for instructions on assigning additional study drug kits for 
delays in roll-over until eligibility is determined.  
If the Month 6 biopsy results are normal or the sample contains scant endometrium 
without abnormalities, the subject is eligible to enter the extension study.
In the event the Month 6 biopsy cannot be performed (e.g., due to a stenotic cervix or 
location of fibroids), or an insufficient biopsy sample is obtained and the concurrent TVU indicates a thickness of > 4 mm, a repeat bi opsy must be performed.  If upon repeat, a 
sample cannot be obtained or remains insufficient, the AbbVie TA MD should be consulted.
If a repeat biopsy is performed and the resu lts are normal or the sample contains scant 
endometrium without abnormalities, the sub ject is eligible to enter the extension study.
Subjects with abnormal endometrial pathology results (including, e ndometrial hyperplasia 
with or without atypia and endometrial cancer) at Treatment Month 6 are not eligible to 
enter the extension study and instead will enter the Post-Treatment Follow-up Period.  
The endometrial pathology should be  managed according to standard of care.
Physical Examination
A complete physical examination will be performed during the Washout Period (if applicable) or Screening Period and will include height and weight measurements (the subject should not wear shoes).  Subjects who entered washout will only be required to have a symptom-directed physical examinatio n performed when they enter the Screening 
Period.  
Elagolix (ABT-620)
M12-817 Protocol Amendment 2
83
During the Treatment Period and Post-Treatment Follow-Up Periods, a complete physical 
examination will be performed at Day 1 (prior to dosing), Month 6 and Post-Treatment Follow-up Month 6 or Premature Discontinuation.  The complete physical examination at Day 1, Month 6 or Premature Discontinuation w ill include weight measurements.  
Symptom Directed Physical Examinations will be performed as specified in Appendix C .
Clinically significant physical examination findings prior to randomization will be recorded as medical history.  Any clinically significant physical examination findings after dosing will be recorded in the source documents and in the eCRFs as adverse events.
Vital Signs
Vital sign determination of heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate and body 
temperature will be obtained at all visits during the study as indicated in Appendix C .  
The blood pressure and heart rate measurements should be taken prior to scheduled blood collections.  Body temperature measurements should be assessed using the same modality consistently throughout the study, e.g., oral, aural, axillary, etc., and the modality will be 
reported in the source documents and eCRF.
The vital signs measurements prior to dosing on Day 1 will serve as the baseline 
measurements for clinical assessment.
12-Lead Electrocardiogram (ECG)
A resting 12-lead ECG will be conducted during the Screening Period and at the 
Treatment Month 6 Visit or Premature Discontinuation visit (if applicable) of the Treatment Period, as indicated in Appendix C .  
For any abnormal screening test results, the ECG may be repeated at a later date, however the subject must meet eligibility prior to Study Day 1 (Randomization).  Final results will be entered into the eCRF.
The Investigator or qualified designee at the study site will determine if any findings 
outside the normal physiological variation are clinically significant (in consultation with a 
Elagolix (ABT-620)
M12-817 Protocol Amendment 2
84
cardiologist if necessary), and document this on the ECG tracing/report, sign and date it.  
The original ECG tracing or a certified copy of the original tracing with the physician's 
assessment will be retained in the subject's r ecords at the study site.  For ECG with QT 
interval corrected for heart rate (QTc) > 450 msec, the correction formula used (i.e., Bazett's or Fridericia's) should be recorded in source documents and the eCRF.  The study site should use the same correction formula consistently throughout the study.  
Mammogram
A mammogram will be obtained during Screening only for subjects who will be 39 years of age or older at the time of rando mization unless the subject had a mammogram 
performed within 3 months prior to Screening.  Local mammogram results and final interpretation must be entered into the eCRF.
If a subject's mammogram results are incomplete (BI-RADS 0) and needs to be repeated, 
the AbbVie TA MD does not need to be contacted for approval prior to conducting the repeat mammogram or other mode of imaging (e.g., ultrasound, spot compression).  If results meet entry requirements, subject would be allowed to continue in the study.  
If the repeat mammogram or other breast imaging results indicate further testing is 
required (e.g., breast biopsy) to rule out any potential exclusionary findings, the subject is 
not eligible for randomization.  Any further imaging or testing will be performed outside of the protocol and should follow standard of care.  Subjects may be re-screened on a case by case basis after review of the results and consulting the AbbVie TA MD for approval.
The local radiologist's interpretation will be used to determine if a subject meets 
eligibility.  Subjects with normal or benign findings or BI-R ADS Classifications 1, 2 or 3 
as outlined in Appendix D will be eligible for randomization.  Subjects with an abnormal 
mammogram or BI-RADS 0, 4 or 5, will not be eligible for randomization into the study.  
Subjects should continue with recommended mammography screening outside of the 
protocol per local guidelines and standard of care during the study.

Central Imaging Procedures
Fibroid and uterine assessments will be obtained using pelvic ultrasound (TAU and TVU) 
throughout the study, and SIS at Screening.  In addition to the TAU and TVU, an MRI will be performed in a subset of subjects during the Treatment and Post-Treatment Follow-up Period who consent to participate in the MRI Subset.  The goal of the MRI subset is to evaluate uterine fibroid size and volume and uterine volume using another technique in addition to ultrasound.  All ultr asound and MRI images will be sent to the 
Central Imaging Core Lab (ICL) for review to determine eligibility for rando mization and 
to monitor safety during the Treatment and Post Treatment Follow-Up Periods.
The pelvic ultrasound (TAU, TVU, and SIS) and MRI (if applicable) will be performed 
by the investigative sites' or affiliated Radi ology Department.  The ultrasonographer at 
each investigative site will be required to acquire the ultrasound, SIS and MRI (if applicable) images according to the Imaging Ac quisition Guidelines provided by the ICL.  
Images should be sent/transmitted to the ICL to determine eligibility for entry into the study and for subject evaluation during the course of the study.  Refer to the Image Acquisition Guidelines for instructions on submitting images to the ICL.
The pelvic ultrasound (TAU, TVU and SIS) and MRI (if applicable) will be assessed both 
locally and by the ICL.  The ICL will issue an Eligibility Form based on review of the pelvic ultrasound and SIS indicating the presence or absence of a qualifying fibroid and/or uterine volume and whether any exclusiona ry pathology was present.  If images are 
unevaluable, the ICL will inform the investigat ive site and additional images will need to 
be resubmitted.  If there is a discrepancy between the local assessment and the central reader's assessment, this should be brought to AbbVie's attention and AbbVie will discuss the findings with the local site and centra l reader on a case-by-case basis to determine 
eligibility.  
The Investigator or designee should consult the local ultrasound and SIS reports and/or 
images in order to make any eligibility and safety-related judgments concerning the subject.  The interpretation of the local report and/or images will be filed or recorded in 
Elagolix (ABT-620)
M12-817 Protocol Amendment 2
86
the subject's source documents.  Data and/or local interpretation from the local ultrasound 
and SIS images will not be recorded in the eCRF.
The ICL will only issue a report for pelvic ultrasound at Treatment Month 6.  A report for 
all other Treatment and Post-Treatment timepoints for pelvic ultrasound and MRI will only be issued if any significant changes are observed that may affect subject safety during the study.  In these cases, the Investigator should review the local ultrasound and/or MRI images and treat as per standard of care.
The pelvic ultrasound, SIS and MRI (if applicable) will be performed as specified in 
Appendix C .
It is recommended that the pelvic ultrasound and MRI (if applicable) performed for the Month 6 Visit are conducted approximately 15 days prior to the scheduled Month 6 Visit to ensure the images are received and acceptable for review by the central vendor.  The central pelvic ultrasound report is only required prior to rollover in the event the Month 6 endometrial biopsy cannot be performed or biopsy results are insufficient.  In this case the 
central pelvic ultrasound is required to determine if the endometrial thickness is ≥ 4 mm 
in which case the subject needs a repeat biopsy prior to rollover (see Section 5.3.1.1
Endometrial Biopsy).  If the results are not available by the Month 6 visit of the Treatment Period to determine need for a repeat endometrial biopsy, refer to Section 5.4.4for 
instructions until results are available to deter mine eligibility into the extension study.  
Qualifying Uterine Fibroids:
The following types of uterine fibroids will qualify a subject for randomization: 
Fibroid size/ut erine volume:  
●At least 1 fibroid with a diameter ≥ 2 cm (longest diameter)
OR
●Multiple fibroids with a total uterine volume of ≥ 200 cm3to ≤2,500 cm3as 
documented by centrally read imaging vendor
Elagolix (ABT-620)
M12-817 Protocol Amendment 2
87
Type of fibroid/fibroid location:
●Intramural fibroids
●Submucosal non-pedunculated fibroids
●Large (≥ 4 cm) subserosal fibroid
The following types of uterine fibroids are exclusionary:
●Intracavitary pedunculated submucosal fibroids
●Solitary pedunculated subserosal fibroids
●Small (< 4 cm) solitary subserosal fibroids
Pelvic Ultrasound:  TAU and TVU
A pelvic ultrasound (TAU and TVU) will be performed early in the Screening Period and 
as early in the menstrual cycle as possible in all subjects, or in the Washout Period, if applicable.  Subsequent pelvic ultrasounds will be performed at the time points indicated in Appendix C , Study Activities.  The pelvic ultrasound will determine the presence of 
qualifying uterine fibroids and uterine volume.  The TAU and TVU will be used to confirm the presence of qualifying uterine fibroids (at least 1 fibroid with diameter ≥ 2 cm 
(longest diameter), or multiple small fibroids with a uterine volume of ≥ 200 cm
3to
≤2,500 cm3, and to obtain measurements of the dimensions of the uterus and of the 
largest fibroid.  The TVU will be used to assess gynecological disorders, such as ovarian cysts, endometriomas.  However, these assessments can also be made by TAU, if necessary.
Assessments for the pelvic ultrasound include, but are not limited to the following:
●Endometrial thickness 
●Presence of abnormal endometrial appearance or endometrial pathology
●Presence of uterine fibroids
●Number of uterine fibroids
●Volume and location of the 3 largest fibroids
Elagolix (ABT-620)
M12-817 Protocol Amendment 2
88
●Uterine volume in cubic centimeters
●Presence of ovarian cysts 
○Number
○Size (cm)
○Location (right or left ovary)
○Simple versus complex
●Endometrioma > 3.5 cm longest diameter
●Solid ovarian lesions > 1.5 cm longest diameter
Saline Infusion Sonohysterography (SIS)
In addition to the pelvic ultrasound, an SIS will also be performed in all subjects during 
the Screening Period, to assess exclusion criteria based on the presence of focal intracavitary lesions including:
●Endometrial polyp ≥1 cm 
●Intracavitary submucosalpedunculated fibroid
The SIS should be performed as early as possible during the Screening Period to rule out any exclusionary findings; for subjects entering washout, an SIS will not be performed until the subject enters the Screening Period in order to limit the number of invasive procedures prior to fully determining eligibility.  The subject must have a confirmed negative urine pregnancy test result within 24 hours prior to undergoing the SIS.  It is advised that the SIS be performed post-menses to Day 10 of the menstrual cycle.  Ibuprofen and antibiotics may be administered prior to conducting the SIS, if standard of care.  
If a subject is known to have an endometrial polyp ≥ 1 cm, and desires to have the polyp
removed outside of the study, prior to entering Screening the subject must have a negative 
pathology report and return to one normal menses prior to screening.
Elagolix (ABT-620)
M12-817 Protocol Amendment 2
89
Subjects who have qualifying uterine fibroids and uterine volume as assessed by 
ultrasound; however, have SIS images which are unable to fully assess the endometrial cavity, may undergo additional imaging modaliti es such as MRI for further evaluation.
An SIS may be performed during the Treatment Period if there is an intracavitary finding on ultrasound or MRI.
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Subset:
A subset of subjects who consent to participate in the MRI Subset will have an MRI 
performed at the Day 1 (unless an MRI was performed in Screening as indicated below) and Month 6 or Premature Discontinuation visits during the Treatment Period and at the Post-Treatment Follow-Up Month 3 or Post-Treatment Premature Discontinuation Visit.  
If the Day 1 MRI cannot be performed within the specified assessment window per 
Table 1, the MRI should not be performed and the subject will not participate in the MRI 
Subset.  Subjects who have qualifying uterine fibroids and uterine volume as assessed by ultrasound; however, have SIS images which are unable to fully assess the endometrial cavity, may undergo additional imaging modalities  such as MRI for further evaluation in 
Screening.
Subjects who had an MRI prior to Day 1 and agree to be part of the MRI subset, will not 
have an MRI repeated at Day 1; instead, s ubjects will have MRIs performed at the 
Month 6 visit during the Treatment Period and at the Post-Treatment Follow-Up Month 3 Visit.  
Assessments for the MRI include, but are not limited to the following:
●Fibroid volume in cubic centimeters (of 3 largest fibroids) 
●Fibroid location
●Uterine volume in cubic centimeters
●Presence of adenomyosis (diffuse adenomyosis as the dominant condition 
versus focal) 
Elagolix (ABT-620)
M12-817 Protocol Amendment 2
90
●Presence of any concerning findings
If the subject prematurely discontinued prior to Month 3, i.e., received < 3 months of 
study drug during the Treatment Period, an MRI will not be performed at the Premature Discontinuation visit during the Treatmen t or Post-Treatment Follow-Up Period.
Depending on the size of the uterus, MRI images  of the abdominal cavity may need to be 
submitted to measure uterine volume and to assess for safety.  It is recommended to follow standard of care when determining which anatomical sections are to be included in order to prevent incomplete views, thus leading to repeat procedures.  Please refer to the Image Acquisition Guidelines for further details.
Intracavitary Uterine Findings
An SIS may be performed during the Treatment or Post-Treatment Follow-Up Periods if 
the pelvic ultrasound (TAU and TVU) or MRI (if applicable) results suggest an intracavitary lesion such as a polyp.  The finding of a polyp during the Treatment or Post-Treatment Periods should be documented as an adverse event if the Investigator considers it to be clinically significant.  
The AbbVie TA MD should be notified of the subject's management plan for any 
clinically significant pathologic findings during the Treatment and Post-Treatment Periods.
Ovarian Findings:
During Screening, if the initial pelvic ultrasound shows a simple ovarian cyst > 5 and 
≤7 cm in longest diameter, an ultrasound of the ovaries may be repeated in approximately 
4 to 6 weeks.  The repeat results must be evaluated prior to Day 1, Random ization, and 
not meet exclusion criteria (i.e., persistent simple ovarian cyst > 5 cm).
In Screening, if any of the adnexal structures, such as an ovary, cannot be visualized on 
the pelvic ultrasound due to, for example, fibroid location and/or fibroid size, the subject may be eligible for randomization provided there are no exclusionary findings.
Elagolix (ABT-620)
M12-817 Protocol Amendment 2
91
During Treatment or Post-Treatment, if the pelvic ultrasound shows a simple ovarian cyst 
> 5 cm or a complex ovarian cyst (including endometriomas) > 3.5 cm in longest diameter the findings should be documented as an adverse event if the Investigator considers them to be clinically significant.  
Bone Mineral Density (DXA Scan)
DXA scans of the spine, femoral neck and total hip will be performed by qualified 
technologist/radiologists utilizing GE Lunar or Hologic equipment and sent to an ICL for review and analysis.  Site training and qualifications, including assessment of instruments, will be completed prior to screening the first subject.  Instructions on calibration and standardization of instruments will be specified in a manual that will be provided to all study sites.  Sites will need to obtain approval from the ICL prior to initiating study scans.  
A DXA scan will be performed during the Screening Period to determine eligibility based 
on BMD measurements from the ICL.  Subjects with a T-score of ≤ –1.5 at the lumbar 
spine, total hip or femoral neck on the screening DXA scan will not be eligible for randomization into the study.  
During the Treatment Period, a DXA scan will be performed at Month 6 or Premature 
Discontinuation visit (Subjects who prematurely  discontinue treatment prior to Month 3 
will not have a DXA at the Premature Disc ontinuation Visit unless the premature 
discontinuation was related to BMD decrease or the occurrence of a fracture).  In the event there is a change in DXA machine for a subject between baseline and a subsequent time point, the AbbVie TA MD must be notified.
It is recommended that the bone scan performed for the Month 6 Visit is conducted 
approximately 15 days prior to the scheduled Month 6 Visit to ensure the results are received from the central vendor in order to determine eligibility for inclusion into the 
extension study.  If DXA results are not available by the Month 6 visit of the Treatment Period, refer to Section 5.4.4for instructions until results are available to determine 
eligibility into the extension study.
Elagolix (ABT-620)
M12-817 Protocol Amendment 2
92
During the Post-Treatment Follow-Up Period, DXA scans will be performed in all 
subjects at the Month 6 and Month 12 visits in the Post-Treatment Follow-Up Peri od.  
However, if the subject prematurely discontinued prior to the Treatment Month 3 visit, i.e., received < 3 months of study drug during the Treatment Period, Post-Treatment DXA scans will not be performed (unless the premature discontinuation was related to BMD or the occurrence of a fracture) and the subject will complete the study at the Post-Treatment Month 6 visit.  
A BMD decrease at any anatomic lo cation (spine, to tal hip or femoral neck) during the 
Treatment or Post-Treatment Follow-up period that leads to discontinuation from study or 
a BMD decrease at any anatomic lo cation with a T-score < – 1.5 should be reported as AE.
Determination of BMD Eligibility for Inclusion into the Extension Study:
Inclusion of subjects for BMD criteria in the extension study will be based on the parameters specified below and illustrated in Figure 3 . 
●Subjects with BMD decrease < 8% in the spine, total hip and femoral neck will 
be eligible based on DXA for entry into the extension study.
●Subjects with ≥ 8% BMD decrease at any location at Month 6 of the Tr eatment 
Period are not eligible for entry into the extension study and will instead enter 
into the Post-Treatment Follow-Up Period and continue with BMD evaluation 
as illustrated in Figure 4 .

Subjects with Post-Treatment Month 12 BMD % decrease of < 3% in the spine, femoral 
neck and total hip and no decrease in any region from Post-Treatment Follow-up Month 6 to Month 12 will not require a referral to a bone specialist.
Subjects will be referred to a Bone Specialist at Post-Treatment Follow-up Month 12, 
even if the overall BMD decrease from baseline is < 3%, if they meet the following criteria:
●Subject had Post-Treatment Month 6 BMD decrease compared to baseline in 
any region and demonstrates further BMD decrease at Month 12 in the same 
region (between Post-Treatment Month 6 and Month 12) and, subject meets one of the following:
○Subject was ≥ 45 years of age at the time of last dose of study drug in the 
Treatment Period 
OR
○Subject has not had a menses in the past 12 months
●Subjects with Post-Treatment Month 12 BMD % decrease of ≥ 3% in the 
spine, femoral neck or total hip and a T-score < –1.0 OR T-score < –1.5 will 
be referred to a bone specialist for further management, and will be followed 
on an individual basis.  
The management plan for subjects referred to a Bone Specialist (e.g., Endocrinologist, 
Rheumatologist, International Society for Clinical Densitometry (ISCD) certified physician) will be reviewed with the AbbVie TA MD, with follow-up information provided on the subject evaluation, treatment, and outcome.  Follow-up information from 
the initial evaluation will be recorded in the eCRF.  It is recommended that the Bone Specialist should be someone other than the Principal Investigator or Sub-Investigator.

should be performed after vital signs and ECG recordings are conducted at a visit.  All 
clinical laboratory samples will be shipped to the central laboratory, with the exception of the venous blood sample for alkaline hematin analysis which will be sent to the alkalinehematin lab.  Residual serum samples r emaining after chemistry testing has been 
performed will be stored frozen at the central laboratory for possible repeat testing or further analysis upon AbbVie's request.
The laboratory results (except Apo A a nd Apo B) will be provided by the central 
laboratory to the investigative site where they will be reviewed, signed and dated by the 
Investigator.  For any value outside of the reference range, the Investigator will indicate on the report if the result is clinically significant (CS) or not clinically significant (NCS).  The Investigator will assess clinically significant laboratory values per standard of care which may include repeating the test to verify the out-of-range value.  Clinically significant laboratory  abnormalities post-ra ndomization may be documented as adverse 
events, depending on the interpretation of the Investigator (Section 6.1).
All screening laboratory results must be reviewed prior to randomization, including any 
repeated test results.  Subjects will not be randomized if laboratory results are clinically significant.  The laboratory test results ob tained from the Day 1 pre-dose samples will 
serve as the baseline for clinical assessment.
The Investigator will receive Sponsor defined alerts from the central lab.  The Investigator 
will review the lab alerts and assess clinical significance for potential events.
Blood samples for Pharmacogenetic (PG), Ph armacokinetic (PK), and Pharmacodynamic 
(PD) analysis will be collected and processed as indicated in Section 5.3.1.2(PG), 
Section5.3.1.3(PD) and Section 5.3.2(PK).
Safety Laboratory Tests
Clinical safety laboratory tests consist of hematology, clinical chemistry, including lipid 
panel and urinalysis samples.  The clinical chemistry and lipid panel samples should be 
obtained in the morning following an overnight fast (minimum of 8 hours); however, 
Elagolix (ABT-620)
M12-817 Protocol Amendment 2
98
there may be circumstances when a sample is obtained later in the day and/or not under 
fasting conditions.  If a sample was obtained with less than 8 hours of fasting, the Source Documents and the lab requisition should be marked to indicate that the sample was 
obtained under non-fasting conditions.
Lipid Panel
If, during the Treatment or through Post-Treatment Period Month 12 Visit the lipid panel 
results for LDL cholesterol, Triglycerides, To tal cholesterol are more than 3 × the upper 
limit of normal ra nge and the sample was not obtained under fasting c onditions (minimum 
8 hour fast), the subject will return to the office as soon as possible to have the panel repeated under fasting conditions. 
Apolipoprotein A and B, (Apo A and Apo B)
Blood samples for Apo A and Apo B will be collected as part of the chemistry panel.  The 
Apo A and Apo B data are exploratory a nd results will not be provided to the 
investigative site.
Serology Testing for Hepatitis and HIV
Subjects will be tested for HAV-IgM, HBsAg, HCV Ab HIV and anti-HIV Ab by the 
central laboratory during the Screening Period.  If any of these tests are positive or reactive, the subject is excluded from study participation.  Borderline hepatitis test results should be repeated.
HIV testing will be conducted by ELISA; if the test result is reactive, testing will 
automatically reflex to Multispot assay.  If results are negative or indeterminate, HIV-1 
TMA assay is performed to complete the confirmation with results of:  Not Detected or Detected.  If the HIV ELISA test result is reactive or TMA assay results are detected, the subject will be screen-failed.   
The results of the HIV and anti-HIV Ab testing will be retained confidentially by the 
study site.

Urine Test for Gonorrhea and Chlamydia (Optional) 
Gonorrhea and chlamydia testing can be ordered at the Investigator's discretion during the 
Screening Period, to test for active gonorrhea or chlamydia prior to undergoing the endometrial biopsy and SIS.  Any treatmen t provided will occur outside of the protocol.
Endocrine Panel
The endocrine panel consists of the following analytes:  FSH, LH, reflexive TSH and thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG).  
Sanitary Product Collection for Alkaline Hematin Assay
Quantitative measurement of the volume of MBL will be performed using the alkaline 
hematin method.  Menstrual blood loss will be assessed in all subjects using validated 
sanitary products, also referred to as "validated" products.  Validated products have 
undergone analytical testing by the analytical lab to confirm adequate precision and accuracy of blood recovery as well as no or limited interference with the alkaline hematin 
method.  
Subjects will start to collect their sanitary products in the Screening Period over the 
course of 2 to 3 menstrual cycles to determine eligibility for rando mization based on 
MBL.  Subjects will continue to collect sanitary products after eligibility based on MBL in Screening is determined.  There will be no interruption in co llection of sanitary 
products between Screening and Randomization and the Subject should be instructed to collect sanitary products starting in Screening and throughout the 6-month Treatment Period to determine the change from baseline in MBL volume, and up through their first menses with full menstrual flow in the Post-Treatment Follow-up Period to assess return to menses.
Starting in Screening, subjects will be dispensed sanitary co llection kits that consist of 
validated sanitary products, product collection bags, bar-coded labels and a keg with 
screw-on lid for storage as provided by the vendor.  It is important that only the sanitary

products provided for use during the study are used.  Validated sanitary products may 
include:
●Tampax tampons (Regular, Super or Super-Plus absorbency)
●Stayfree Maxi Pads (Regular, Super Long or Overnight absorbency)
●Carefree Original Long Unscented pantiliners 
Subjects will be required to collect and retain all sanitary products on days with menstrual bleeding or spotting (subjects must be instructed to collect and return all used or 
worn products even if there is no visible blood on the products or if non-validated products were used) as described in the Alkaline Hematin Laboratory Manual.
The dispensation and collection requirements in the Screening, Treatment and Post-Treatment Periods are outlined in Figure 5 .
Figure 5. Sanitary Product Dispensation and Collection

Screening Product Collection Visits
Subjects will be dispensed a product collection kit and will collect sanitary products on 
days with bleeding or spotting.  Subjects will visit the site within approximately 5 days after cessation of bleeding or spotting for Screening Menstrual Cycles 1 and 2, and if applicable, Cycle 3 Product Collection Visits.  At each Screening Product Collection Visit, sanitary products to measure MBL w ill be collected and a venous blood sample will 
be obtained.  The site will submit the sanitary products and venous blood sample to the Alkaline Hematin Laboratory for analysis of MBL volume to determine eligibility.  To be eligible for the study based on MBL, a subject must demonstrate > 80 mL for each of 2 menses in Screening.
Under very limited conditions, additional sc reening menstrual cycles may be permitted; 
however the situation must be discussed with AbbVie prior to allowing additional product 
collections.  Screening Menstrual Cycle 1 for menstrual bleeding assessment begins with the first day of bleeding or spotting associ ated with menses.  If a subject has a known 
history of HMB and her first screening MBL amount is ≤ 80 mL due to a variety of 
factors that may include missed collect ion of products, submission of non-v alidated 
products (products that have not been tested to determine the level of interference with the alkaline hematin assay), or an atypical menstrual cycle, or if a subject misses the collection of sanitary products for one of the screening menstrual cycles, the Study Site must consult with AbbVie for further instructions, which may include the co llection of 
sanitary products for an additional menstrual cycle.  The subject may still be eligible for randomization if she demonstr ates blood loss > 80 mL during at least 2 screening 
menstrual cycles.  Table 5provides an overview of eligibility based on MBL.

Sites will contact the Interactive Response Technology (IRT) at the Screening Cycle 2 
Product Collection Visit to register the date of the visit for the first subject who completes the Screening Cycle 2 Product Collection Visit.  The registration of this visit will trigger the initial shipment of study drug to the study site.
Sanitary Product Collection During the Treatment Period
During the Treatment Period, Subjects will continue to collect sanitary products on all 
days with menstrual bleeding or spotting.  
As in Screening, sanitary products collected during the Treatment Period will be returned 
by the Subject within approximately 5 days after cessation of menstrual bleeding or spotting and a venous sample will be obtained at either a scheduled monthly visit or at a Product Collection Visit, as appropriate.  
Treatment Period Product Collection Visits
Product Collection Visits are only necessary if a monthly visit is not scheduled to occur 
within approximately 5 days after cessation of menstrual bleeding or spotting.  During the 
Product Collection Visits, subjects will have a venous blood sample, urine pregnancy test, vital signs, contraception counseling, as w ell as adverse event and concomitant 
medication assessment.  Product Collection Visits during the Treatment Period should be

numbered in sequential order (e.g., Product Collection Visit 1, Product Collection Visit 2, 
etc.) and entered into the eCRF.
Subjects who do not return a sanitary product collection keg at a site visit (scheduled 
monthly visit, PCV or Unscheduled Visit) will be administered the UBQ by the Site Staff.  
The Site Staff will ask the subject if she had any bleeding or spotting since the previous visit.  If the subject did have bleeding or spotting since the previous visit, the site staff will ask why the subject did not return sanitary products.  Responses to these questions will be documented on the UBQ by the Site Staff.
Sanitary Produ ct Collection During the Post-Treatment Follow-Up Period
Subjects will be required to collect sanitary products on days with menstrual bleeding or 
spotting for their first menses with full menstrual flow in the Post-Treatment Follow-up Period.  If the subject misses collecting sanitary products for her first full menses, she will be required to collect sanitary products for her next full menses.  Once a subject has submitted sanitary products from her first full menses in the Post-Treatment Follow-up Period, she will no longer be required to collect sanitary products during her subsequent menses. 
Subjects who have not returned to their first full menses and have not returned a sanitary 
product collection keg in the Post-Treatment Follow-up Period will be administered the UBQ by the Site Staff.  The Site Staff will ask the subject if she had any bleeding or spotting since the previous visit.  If the subject did have bleeding or spotting since the previous visit, the site staff will ask why the subject has not returned for a Post-Treatment Product Collection Visit to return her sanitary produ cts.  Responses to these questions will 
be documented on the UBQ by the Site Sta ff.  Once a Subject returns sanitary products 
from a full menses in the Post-Treatment Follow-up Period, the Post-Treatment UBQ no longer needs to be completed.

Return of Sanitary Products to Alkaline Hematin Vendor
The site will submit the sanitary products and venous blood sample collected at the 
scheduled monthly visits or Product Collection Visits to the Alkaline Hematin Lab for analysis as outlined in the Alkaline Hematin Laboratory Manual.  
Home Visits
There may be an option for subjects to ha ve a Product Collection Visit conducted at home 
by a Home Health Care Agent who will go to the Subject's home to draw a venous blood 
sample and retrieve the collection keg to return to the site.  
Use of Non-Validated Products
All subjects are to only use validated products, however in cases when a subject used 
non-validated (a product not provided for use in the study), the subject should be instructed to collect and submit the non-validated products to the Study Site.  
Subjects Pending Results for Eligibility into the Extension Study
Site Staff should continue to dispense sanitary products and sanitary product collection 
kits to subjects if results for entry into the extension study are pending at the time of the Month 6 visit.  
Sanitary products collected after the Month 6 visit will be returned to the site within 
approximately 5 days after cessation of menstrual bleeding or spotting as a Product Collection Visit and this collection w ill be numbered sequentially (refer to the Treatment 
Period Product Collection Visit section above).
Refer to Figure 5 , Sanitary Product Dispensation and Co llection for details on 
dispensation and collection requirements.

Patient Reported Outcomes (PRO) Rating Scales
Prior to the start of the study, Site Personnel will be trained on all rating scales used in 
this study.  The objective of this training is to establish uniformity across sites in 
administration of these rating instruments.  The following questionnaires will be completed by the Subjects and/or the Investigator or Site Staff, as appropriate at the time points indicated in Appendix C .  Subjects and Site Staff will be asked to record their 
responses directly onto paper questionnaires and enter into the eCRF.
Reason for Study Participation
In order to better understand the reason(s) why a study participant has decided to enroll in 
this study, subjects will complete the single-question Reason for Study Participation Questionnaire ( Appendix E ) at the Day 1 Visit.  
Physician Surgery Questionnaire
Each physician will be asked to complete the Physician Surgery Questionnaire (PSQ) (Appendix F ) at the Day 1 Visit.  
The PSQ evaluates the likelihood that the Physician would consider surgery or a surgical procedure as one of the treatment options related to uterine fibroids for the subject.  
Uterine Bleeding Questionnaire (Treatment – UBQ)
Subjects who did not return a Sanitary Product Collection Keg (for alkaline hematin 
analysis) at a site visit (scheduled monthly visit, PCV or Unscheduled Visit) during the Treatment Period, will be asked to indicate whether they had any uterine bleeding or spotting since their last study visit.  If the subject did not have uterine bleeding or spotting the site staff will indicate "No" on the UBQ.  If the subject did have bleeding or spotting, the subject will be asked the reason they did not return sanitary product collection keg.  This response will be recorded on the UBQ ( Appendix G ) by the Site Staff.
Elagolix (ABT-620)
M12-817 Protocol Amendment 2
106
Post-Treatment Uterine Bleeding Questionnaire (Post-Treatment-UBQ)
Subjects who have not collected and returned sa nitary products for their first menses with 
full menstrual flow in the Post-Treatment Follow-up Period, w ill be asked at each visit 
before sanitary products are returned if they had any bleeding or spotting since their last 
visit.  If the subject did not have uterine bleeding or spotting the site staff will indicate "No" on the UBQ.  If the subject did have bleeding or spotting, the subject will be asked the reason she did not return the sanitary product collection keg.  This response will be recorded on the UBQ ( Appendix H ) by the Site Staff.  Once a Subject returns sanitary 
products from a full menses in the Post-Treatment Follow-up Period, the Post-Treatment UBQ no longer needs to be completed.
Uterine Fibroid Symptoms Quality of Life (UFS-QoL) (4-Week Recall)
The UFS-QoL ( Appendix I ) is a disease-specific self-administered questionnaire used to 
measure health-related quality of life in women with symptomatic uter ine fibroids.  Each 
subject will be asked to complete a modified (4-week recall) UFS-QoL Questionnaire10to 
report fibroid-related symptoms experienced during the previous 4 weeks.Patient Global Impression of Change – Menstrual Bleeding (PGIC-MB)
Subjects will use the PGIC-MB ( Appendix J ) to assess the change in their severity of 
menstrual bleeding (from very much improved to very much worse) since initiation of 
study drug by choosing one of seven responses.
Patient Global Impression of Change – Non-Bleeding Uterine Fibroids Symptoms 
(PGIC-NBUFS) 
Subjects will complete the PGIC-NBUFS ( Appendix K ) to document the presence of and 
to assess the change in the overall severity of non-bleeding uterine fibroid symptoms and 
the severity of specific non-bleeding uterine fibroid symptoms (from very much improved to very much worse) si nce initiation of study drug.

The EQ-5D-5L ( Appendix M ) is a standardized measure comprised of 5 questions, 
measuring 5 dimensions of health status (mobility, self-care, usual activities, 
pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression).  Subjects will be asked to select a response to each category that best describes their current health.  The EQ-5D-5L also contains a visual analogues scale that provides quantitative measure of health as judged by the individual respondents.  Subjects will also be asked to rate their current health on a scale of 0 – 100.   
Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS)
The C-SSRS is a systematically administered instrument developed to track suicidal 
adverse events across a treatment study.  The instrument is designed to assess suicidal behavior and ideation, track and assess all suicidal events, as well as the lethality of attempts.  Additional features assessed in clude frequency, duration, controllability, reason 
for ideation, and deterrents.  The Screening-Baseline C-SSRS ( Appendix N ) questionnaire 
will be administered in Screening and Day 1.  During the Treatment Period, the C-SSRS, Since Last Visit ( Appendix O ) questionnaire will be administered as specified in 
Appendix C . 
During Screening or at the Day 1 visit, prior to randomization, any subject noted to have 
suicidal ideation with plan within the last year, either via answering "yes" to question 4 
and/or question 5 to the suicidal ideation portion of the C SSRS, or via clinical interview,
is not eligible for randomization.  If the subject expresses suicidal ideation on the C-SSRS or via clinical interview at any time duri ng the study, the Investigator should take

appropriate action and then notify the AbbVie TA MD.  Appropriate steps will be taken to 
protect the subject (including possible discont inuation from the study and referral for 
appropriate psychiatric care).  The C-SSRS will be administered at the times outlined in 
Appendix C .  The C-SSRS administered at the Day 1 Visit will serve as the baseline for 
clinical assessment.
Health Care Resource Utilization (HCRU)
The Health Care Resource Utilization questionnaire ( Appendix P ) will be used to capture 
routine/g eneral health care visits (that are not associated with an adverse event) to non-
study Health Care Providers during the Tr eatment Period.  Subjects will be asked to 
provide information on any visits to non-study Health Care Practitioners in the past 
4 weeks for routine/general health visits including any diagnostic or therapeutic procedures that were performed.  The responses will be recorded on the HCRU by the Site Staff.  Health care resource use related to an Adverse Event or Serious Adverse Event will be captured as part of the Adverse Event, independent of the HCRU, and recorded in the eCRF.

Randomization and Assignment of Subject Numbers
The site will contact IRT during the Washout or Screening Period to obtain a subject 
(Screening) number after the subject has signed the informed consent.  Consecutive and unique subject numbers will be assigned.  The same subject number will be used to identify the subject throughout the Screening, Treatment and Post-Treatment Follow-Up Periods.  In Screening, the site will contact IRT at the Screening Cycle 2 ProductCollection Visit to register the date of the visit for the first subject who completes the 
Screening Cycle 2 Product Collection Visit.  The registration of this visit will trigger shipment of clinical drug supplies to the study site.  If the subject is not randomized into the study, the reason for screen failure will be documented in the eCRF and the site will register the subject as a screen failure in IRT.
At the Day 1 Visit, eligible subjects will be randomized to 1 of 3 treatment groups by 
using IRT and providing the s ubject number the subject received during Screening or 
Washout.  During the rando mization c ontact, a randomization number and kit number will 
be assigned by the IRT according to a randomization schedule generated by the statistics department at AbbVie.
During the Treatment Period, sites will register each monthly visit in IRT in order to 
obtain a scheduled re-supply of study drug to dispense to each subject.  In the event study drug becomes lost or damaged, the site can contact IRT to obtain an unscheduled re-supply of study  drug kit numbers to dispense.  Sites will register subjects as 
"Completed" or "Discontinued" (if the subject prematurely discontinues) at the end of the Treatment Period and will also indicate whether the subject will enter the Post-Treatment Follow-Up Period or the Extension Study M12-816.
5.3.1.2 Blood Samples for Pharmacogenetic Analysis
One 4 mL whole blood sample for DNA isolation will be collected on Day 1 from each 
subject with consent.  If the sample is not collected on Day 1, it may be collected at any time throughout the study.
Elagolix (ABT-620)
M12-817 Protocol Amendment 2

Additionally, one 2.5 mL whole blood sample for RNA isolation will be collected on 
Day1, Month 1, Month 3, and Month 6 or premature discontinuation with consent.  The procedure for obtaining and documenting informed consent is discussed in Section 9.3.
The samples will be minimally labeled with st udy ID, subject ID, and time-point.  Please 
refer to the Lab manual for instructions on collection and processing of samples.
Samples will be shipped frozen to the central laboratory and later shipped to AbbVie for 
DNA/RNA extraction.  
AbbVie will store the DNA and RNA samples in a secure storage space with adequate 
measures to protect confidentiality.  The samples will be retained while research on ABT-620 (or drugs of this class) continues, but no longer than 20 years.
5.3.1.3 Collection and Handling of Pharmacodynamic Variables
Blood Samples for Estradiol (E2) and Progesterone (P) Assay 
A single blood sample will be collected at each time point indicated in Appendix C to be 
used for the pharmacodynamic analysis of E2 and P.  The blood samples for assay of 
estradiol and progesterone will be collected in one 9 mL evacuated collection tube without anticoagulant (red cap, no gel separators to be used).  Sufficient blood volume will be collected to provide approximately 4 mL serum from each sample.
Refer to the study specific laboratory manual for detailed instructions on sample 
collection, processing and shipment. 
On Day 1, estradiol and progesterone samples will be collected prior to dose.  The date

be collected by venipuncture into 3 mL evacuated K 2-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid 
(K2EDTA)-containing collection tubes at the time points indicated in Appendix C .  
Sufficient blood will be collected to provide approximately 1 mL plasma from each 
sample. 
Refer to the study specific laboratory manual for detailed instructions on sample 
collection, processing and shipment.
The date and time of collection will be r ecorded on the Central Laboratory Requisition 
Form.  The Day 1 visit sample should be  collected approximately 1 hour after the 
first dose of study drug is administered; samples collected on other visit days will be collected at any time during the visit.
5.3.2.2 Measurement Methods
Plasma concentrations of elagolix and norethindrone and serum concentrations of 
estradiol and progesterone will be determined using validated methods by the DrugAnalysis Department at AbbVie.  Plasma or serum concentrations of other possible metabolites may be deter mined with validated or non-validated methods.
5.3.3 Efficacy Variables
5.3.3.1 Primary Efficacy Variable
The primary endpoint will be the percentage  of subjects meeting a composite endpoint 
consisting of these two bleeding assessments:
●MBL volume of < 80 mL during the Final Month (the last 28 days of 
treatment), AND
Elagolix (ABT-620)
M12-817 Protocol Amendment 2
112
●50% or greater reduction in MBL volume from baseline to the Final Month 
(the last 28 days of treatment)
A subject who prematurely discontinues the study drug due to adverse events, "lack of 
efficacy" or "requires surgery or invasive intervention for treatment of uterine fibroids" will be considered as a non-responder regardless whether she meets the two aforementioned responder criteria or not.
5.3.3.2 Secondary Efficacy Variable
The following will be considered secondary variables:
●MBL volume assessed using AH methodology and UBQ
●Suppression of bleeding
●Hemoglobin concentration
●Fibroid and uterine volume
5.3.4 PRO and Quality of Life Variables
●UFS-QoL Questionnaire

5.3.6 Pharmacodynamic Variables
Concentrations of E2, P, LH and FSH will be obtained throughout the Screening and 
Treatment Periods.  Additional pharmacodynamic parameters may be calculated if useful in the interpretation of the data.
5.3.7 Pharmacokinetic Variables
Exposures of elagolix and norethindrone, may be determined using a population PK 
approach.  Additional parameters may be calculated if useful in the interpretation of the data.
5.3.8 Pharmacogenetic Variables
DNA and RNA samples may be sequenced and data analyzed for RNA expression and 
genetic factors contributing to the subject's response to elagolix, or other study treatment, in terms of pharmacokinetics, efficacy, tolerabili ty and safety.  Such genetic factors may 
include genes for drug metabolizing enzymes, drug transport proteins, genes within the target pathway, or other genes believed to be related to drug response.  Some genes currently insufficiently characterized or unknown may be understood to be important at the time of analysis.  The samples may be analyzed as part of a multi-study assessment of genetic factors involved in the response to elagolix or drugs of this class.  The samples may also be used for the development of diagnostic tests related to elagolix (or drugs of this class).  The results of pharmacogenetic analyses may not be reported with the study summary.

An Independent Data Monitoring Co mmittee (IDMC) will be employed for this Phase 3 
study and will have the usual responsibilitie s for safeguarding the interests of study 
participants and monitoring the overall study conduct.  The IDMC will provide 
recommendations about continuing, modifying, or stopping the trial for safety reasons.  The IDMC membership and responsibilities will be documented in its charter.  After each IDMC meeting, the IDMC will communicate its recommendations to the sponsor, as 
described in the IDMC charter.
5.4 Removal of Subjects from Therapy or Assessment
Each subject has the right to withdraw from the study at any time.  In addition, the 
Investigator may discontinue a subject from the study at any time if the Investigator considers it necessary for any reason, including the occurrence of an adverse event or noncompliance with the protocol.  Subjects who withdraw from the study will not be 
replaced unless it is mutually agreed upon, in writing, by the Investigator and AbbVie.  Each subject will be withdrawn from the st udy if any of the following occur:
●The subject decides to withdraw consent for any reason.
●The investigator believes it is in the best interest of the subject.
●Clinically significant deterioration of the subject's medical status as 
determined by the investigator.
●The subject requires surgical intervention for treatment of uterine fibroids and menstrual bleeding or other procedures including hysterectomy, myomectomy, 
uterine artery embolization, high inten sity focused ultrasound (HIFU), 
endometrial ablation, dilation and curettage (D&C), etc. during the Treatment 
Period.  In the post treatment period these procedures do not warrant 
withdrawal if performed during the Post-Treatment Period unless a 
hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo -oophorectomy  (BSO) is performed and 
the Subject does not plan to use Hormone Replacement Therapy within 
1 month of the surgery date.
●The subject becomes pregnant.

●The subject has (SGPT/ALAT) or SGOT/ASAT elevation > 5 times the upper 
limit of normal conf irmed upon repeat during the Treatment Period.
●The subject's legally acceptable representative decides to withdraw consent for any reason.
●Heavy menstrual bleeding during the Treatment Period that requires a blood 
transfusion at any time after having taken 28 days of study drug.  If a subject 
has a blood transfusion during the Post-Treatment Period, the AbbVie TA MD 
should be contacted to determine if the subject can remain in the study.
●Any other medical reason that AbbVie or the study investigator deems appropriate.
5.4.1 Discontinuation of Individual Subjects
In the event that a subject withdraws or is prematurely discontinued from study drug 
treatment, the subject should complete the Treatment Period Premature Discontinuation Visit as soon as possible (preferably within  2 – 7 days of last dose of study drug, if 
possible) and undergo study procedures as outlined in Appendix C .  Subjects who 
prematurely discontinue during the Treatment Period are expected to enter the 12-Month Post-Treatment Follow-Up Period.
In the event that a subject withdraws or is prematurely discontinued during the 
Post-Treatment Follow-Up period, the subject should complete the Post-Treatment Premature Discontinuation Visit as soon as  possible and undergo study procedures as 
outlined in Appendix C .  These procedures should not interfere with the initiation of any 
new treatments or therapeutic mod alities th e Investigator d etermines are necessary to treat 
the subject's condition.  The reason(s) for the discontinuation from the study will be recorded in the eCRFs.
All used and unused study drug containers will be returned to the study site.If a subject becomes pregnant during the Treatment or Post-Treatment Follow-Up 
Periods, no additional study procedures, except an  ultrasound will be conducted.  Refer to

laboratory result that is clinically significant (as determined by the Investigator), the Investigator will attempt to provide follow-up until a satisfactory clinical resolution of the laboratory result or adverse event is achieved.
5.4.2 Discontinuation of Entire Study
AbbVie may terminate this study prematurely, either  in its entirety or at any study site, for 
reasonable cause provided that written notice is submitted in advance of the intended 
termination.  The Investigator may also terminate the study at his/her site for reasonable cause, after providing written notice to AbbVie in advance of the intended termination.  Advance notice is not required by either party if the study is stopped due to safety concerns.  If AbbVie terminates the study for safety reasons, AbbVie will immediately 
Elagolix (ABT-620)
M12-817 Protocol Amendment 2
117
notify the investigator by telephone and subsequently provide written instructions for 
study termination.
The following procedures for study discontinuation will be followed:
●If the Sponsor has decided to prematurely  discontinue the study, the Sponsor 
will promptly notify in writing the Investigator as well as regulatory 
authorities of the decision and give detailed reasons for the discontinuation.
●The Investigator must promptly notify the IRB/IEC and give detailed reasons for the discontinuation.
●The Investigator must promptly notify the enrolled subjects of the premature discontinuation and administer appropriate treatments such as replacement of 
the treatment regimen, if applicable, by other appropriate regimens.
5.4.3 Treatment Interruption
AbbVie or the Investigator may request that a subject temporarily discontinue study drug 
administration, which will be referred to as "treatment interruption."  The following are examples for reasons when the AbbVie TA MD must be notified in order to assess whether a subject should undergo temporary treatment interruption:  
●Adverse event, that based on clinical judgment, requires temporary suspension 
of treatment or prevents a subject from taking study drug
●Due to malfunction of barrier contraception or unprotected intercourse
Additionally, there may be times when a subject has had treatment interruption due to 
having forgotten to take study  medication, lost study med ication, etc.  If the subject has 
missed 7 or more consecutive days of dosing (with either ABT-620/Placebo or E2/NETA/Placebo), the AbbVie TA MD must be consulted to determine whether the subject may resume study drug administration or continue in the Treatment Period.  
These examples are not all-inclusive; if the Investigator has any questions, these should be 
directed to the AbbVie TA MD.

5.4.4 Delays in Rollover into the Extension Study
Subjects may be required to remain in the Treatment Period following the completion of 
the Month 6 visit if results to determine eligibility into the Extension Study are not available at the time of the Month 6 visit.  Subjects will return to the study site at the same 28-day monthly visit intervals if eligibility for the extension study has not been determined before then.  Subjects will continue to take study drug until eligibility has been established.  These visits will be documented as and registered as Unscheduled Visits.  Sites should register Unscheduled Visits in IRT in order to obtain additional kits of study drug.  Procedures/assessments to be performed during the Unscheduled Visit while the subject is waiting for the determination of eligibility into the extension study, are indicated in the Table 6.

The elagolix study drug, consisting of elagolix or matching placebo, will be supplied in a 
carton.  The E2/NETA study drug, consisting of E2/NETA or matching placebo, will be supplied in a separate carton.  The subject will take the first elagolix dose (morning dose) and first E2/NETA dose of study drug at the study site on Day 1 (Rando mization).  
Subjects will be instructed to self-administer their study drug throughout the 6-month Treatment Period.  
A 1-month supply of each study drug (plus 1 week extra) w ill be dispensed during the 
Treatment Period at the Day 1 (randomization) Visit, and at the Month 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 
visits. 
Study drug will be taken orally twice daily for the entire 6-month Treatment Period.  A 
morning dose of 1 tablet (elagolix or placebo) and 1 capsule (E2/NETA or placebo) and an evening dose of 1 tablet (elagolix or placebo) should be taken each day approximately 12 hours apart.  Study drug should be taken  with approximately 8 oz. (240 mL) of water 
without regard to food.  Study drug should be taken at approximately the same time each morning and evening in order to promote compliance.
If the subject forgets to take the morning dose, she should be instructed to take the 
morning dose as soon as possible and take the evening dose as scheduled.  If the subject 
Elagolix (ABT-620)
M12-817 Protocol Amendment 2
122
forgets to take the evening dose, she should be instructed to take the evening dose as soon 
as possible; if the subject misses the evening dose completely (until the next morning), the subject should only take the morning dose. 
On days when the subject visits the study site for the scheduled visits, she will take her 
morning dose at home, prior to the visit.  The evening dose will be taken from the newly dispensed supply of study drug.  Subjects mu st return all study drug containers at each 
monthly visit.
At the Month 6 visit, a –4 or +6 day visit window will be allowed in order to collect 
sanitary products from the last menstrual bleeding cycle prior to the Month 6 visit if menstrual bleeding starts immediately prior to or coincides with the scheduled visit.  If the +6 day window is needed, the subject will be instructed to continue taking study drug from the extra blister card (1 week supply) until she returns for the Month 6 Visit.
Subjects awaiting results to determine eligibility into the extension study will continue to 
be dispensed study drug until results are available.  Refer to Section 5.4.4for further 
details on dispensing and registering subjects during this waiting period.

5.5.2.1 Packaging and Labeling
AbbVie will supply blinded study drug in monthly kits (i.e., cartons).  Two kits of study 
drug will be provided at each dispensing visit.  One kit consists of Elagolix or matching placebo and the other kit consists of E2/NETA capsules or matching placebo. Each kit contains 5 blister cards, with each blister card containing 7 days of study medication.  There are 4 weekly blister cards and 1 extra medication blister card in each kit to supply enough medication for 4 weeks (28 days) of dosing, plus an extra week's supply.  
Each individual elagolix or matching placebo blister card contains 14 tablets for a 7-day 
(weekly) supply study medication.  Also, each E2/NETA or matching placebo blister card contains 7 capsules for a 7-day (week ly) supply of study medication.  
The kits will be assigned to a subject via IRT and will encode the appropriate study drug to be dispensed at the subject's corresponding study visit.
The kits and blister cards are labeled as per country requirements.  All blank spaces on the 
label will be completed by the site staff prior to dispensing to the subject.  Labels must 
remain affixed to the study drug containers.  Adequate supplies of study drug will be provided to each study site  automatically via IRT.

5.5.2.2 Storage and Disposition of Study Drug
Elagolix, E2/NETA and respective matching placebo study medication must be stored at 
controlled room temperature 15° to 25°C (59° to 77°F).  Additionally, E2/NETA and matching placebo study medication mu st be protected from light.
The investigational products are for investigational use only and are to be used only within the context of this study.  The study drug supplied for this study must be maintained under adequate security and stored under the conditions specified on the label until dispensed for subject use or returned to AbbVie.  Returned study drug should not be re-dispensed to the subject.
5.5.3 Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups
All subjects will be centrally randomized using an IRT.  Before the study is initiated, 
contact information and user guidelines for IRT will be provided to each site.  Study drug will be dispensed at the study visits outlined in Appendix C , Study Activities.
As subjects enter into either the Washout Period or the Screening Period, a unique subject number will be assigned to each subject by the IRT.  This unique subject number will be used for each subject throughout the study.
After confirming that the subject has met randomization criteria and prior to the Day 1 
(randomization) dose, a unique  randomization number will be provided via IRT.
Subjects will be randomly assigned by IRT to receive one of the treatment groups as outlined in Section 5.5.1for a total of 6 months of treatment.
Study drug must not be dispensed without contacting IRT.  Study drug may only be dispensed to subjects enrolled in the study  according to kit numbers provided by the IRT.
The random ization schedule will be computer generated by the Statistics Department at 
AbbVie, North Chicago, IL prior to the start of the study.  A copy of all of the 
Elagolix (ABT-620)
M12-817 Protocol Amendment 2
125
randomization schedules w ill be kept by the Statistics Department at AbbVie and a copy 
will be forwarded to the IRT provider.
5.5.4 Selection and Timing of Dose for Each Subject
Selection of the doses used for this study is discussed in Section 5.6.4.  Subjects will be 
randomized into one of the three treatment groups as described in Section 5.5.1.
Study drug will be initiated at the study site on Day 1 (randomization).  Subjects will be 
instructed to self-administer study drug twi ce a day (once in the morning and once in the 
evening approximately 12 hours apart) with  approximately 8 oz (240 mL) of water.  
Subjects must return all study drug containers (used or unused) at the subsequent visit.
5.5.5 Blinding of Investigational Product
Each active elagolix dose will be ident ical in appearance to its matched placebo; each 
active E2/NETA dose will be identical in appearance to its matched placebo.  The study 
site personnel and subject will remain blinded to each subject's treatment throughout the 
course of the study.  The IRT will provide access to blinded subject treatment information during the study.
AbbVie must be notified before the blind is broken, unless identification of the study drug 
is required for medical emergency; i.e., situation in which the knowledge of the specific 
blinded treatment will affect the immediate management of the subject/patient's conditions (e.g., antidote is available).  AbbVie must then be notified within 24 hours of 
the blind being broken.  The date and reason that the blind was broken must be recorded in the source documents and eCRF, as applicable.
5.5.6 Treatment Compliance
Subjects will be instructed to return all study drug kits (used or unused) to the study site 
personnel at the Month 1, Month 2, Month 3, Month 4, Month 5 and Month 6 or Premature Discontinuation Visits during the Treatment Period.  The study site personnel will document compliance.
Elagolix (ABT-620)
M12-817 Protocol Amendment 2
126
The investigator or his/her designated and qualified representatives will dispense study 
drug only to subjects enrolled in the study in accordance with the protocol.  The study drug must not be used for reasons other than those described in the protocol.
Subjects should be advised of the importance of treatment compliance.  Study drug should 
be taken consistently at approximately the same time in the morning and evening each day.  Daily recordings of study drug dosing will be obtained using a compliance 
packaging blister card for all subjects (for both elagolix/matching placebo and E2/NETA/matching placebo).  AbbVie will provide training and study drug compliance 
materials to sites for instructing subjects on study drug compliance.
Sites will be provided scanning technology for direct access to the dosing compliance 
data; sites are expected to scan all returned blister cards (used/unused/unopened) to obtain the dosing information at each of the Treatment Pe riod visits when st udy drug is returned 
to the site by the subject.  Any unused/unopened blister cards should be documented as such in the scanning technology source docum entation.  Sites are expected to use the 
compliance data to guide them in discussi ons with the subject regarding compliance.  
Upon reviewing the dosing data, if the date(s) and time(s) for any of the last 4 doses of study drug (elagolix or E2/NETA or placebo) prior to the monthly Treatment Period visit 
or Premature Discontinuation visit are missing, the subject will be asked to confirm whether doses were taken and to provide the dates and approximate times of the last 4 scheduled doses prior to the study visit.  The subject reported data will be recorded in source and in the eCRF.  Sites will document when the blister cards are not returned or when blister cards cannot be scanned.
Sites should instruct subjects not to remove extra or multiple medications from the blister 
cards all at once and should only remove the study drug from the blister when it is the time to take the dose.  If the compliance data shows incidence of removing a number of extra medications, sites should re-train the subjects on the importance of only removing study medication when it is time to take the dose and record re-training in the source documents.
Elagolix (ABT-620)
M12-817 Protocol Amendment 2
127
During review of the study drug compliance with the study subject, if the number of 
tablets/capsules to be taken and the number of tablets/capsules returned do not add up to the number of tablets/capsules dispensed, an  explanation should be provided by the 
subject and recorded in the source documents.  
If a subject missed more than 7 consecutive days of taking study drug, the AbbVie TA 
MD should be notified to determine whether the subject may continue.
Compliance packaging data will be used for exposure response analysis.
5.5.7 Drug Accountability
The study Investigator or designee will verify by signature and date that study drug 
supplies are received intact and in the correct amounts indicated on the shipping document Proof of Receipt or similar shipping document or via direct recording in IRT.  The shipment receipt must be acknowledged in IRT in order to become available for dispensation to subjects.  The IRT must also be contacted when any subject discontinues study drug.
The IRT will maintain a current and accurate inventory of all clinical drug supplies, 
accountability, reconciliation, returns and destruction for each site.  The IRT will also include the lot number, kit number, Proof of Receipt number, the number of blister cards/cartons dispensed, initials of person who dispensed the drug, and the date study 
drug was dispensed for each subject.  In addition to using IRT inventory, an accurate inventory of study drug can also be kept by the site.
An overall accountability of the study drug w ill be performed and verified by the site 
monitor via IRT throughout the study and at the study site closeout visit.  Throughout the 
study and upon completion or termination of the study, all used and unused containers 
will be returned to AbbVie according to instructions from AbbVie.
The study investigator or his/her designated representative agrees not to supply study 
medication to any persons not enrolled in th e study or not named as a sub-investigator.
Elagolix (ABT-620)

Study drug will be dispensed at the study visits summarized in Appendix C , Study 
Activities.  Returned study drug should not be re-dispensed to the subject.
5.6 Discussion and Justification of Study Design
5.6.1 Discussion of Study Design and Choice of Control Groups
This Phase 3 study will be conducted as a randomized, double-blind, multi-center, 
placebo-controlled study in premenopausal women 18 to 51 years of age with HMB associated with uterine fibroids.  The rando mized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study 
design is the standard for unbiased assessments of treatment group differences.
This study will evaluate the safety and eff icacy of elagolix 300 mg BID alone and elagolix 
300 mg BID in combination with E2/NETA QD (1.0 mg/0.5 mg) versus placebo in 
subjects with HMB associated with uterine fibro ids.  The study will also assess the impact 
of E2/NETA on the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of elagolix, including hypoestrogenic side effects such as BMD decrease and vasomotor symptoms.  
5.6.2 Appropriateness of Measurements
The safety assessments used in this study are standard, widely used and generally 
recognized as reliable, accurate and relevant within the context of this study design.
Regarding efficacy measures, HMB is the most common symptom of women with uterine 
fibroids.  The quantitation of menstrual blood loss using the alkaline hematin method on sanitary products has been validated by the analy tical testing la boratory.  Pelvic 
ultrasound and SIS are standard methods for a ssessing uterine fibroid size, fibroid and 
uterine volume.  Endometrial biopsy is a standard method for assessing endometrial safety.  DXA is the established gold standard method to assess changes in BMD.
5.6.3 Suitability of Subject Population
Premenopausal women 18 to 51 years of age with HMB (> 80 mL per menstrual cycle) 
and uterine fibroids were selected for this study because that is the population who suffer 
Elagolix (ABT-620)
M12-817 Protocol Amendment 2
129
from HMB associated with uterine fibroid s.  The lower bound of the age limit (18) was 
chosen based on the relative paucity of adolescent females with symptomatic uterine 
fibroids prior to age 18, and the upper age of 51 is included to reduce the risk of subjects becoming menopausal during the study.  No studi es in males or in females outside of the 
reproductive years are necessary for this proposed indication.
5.6.4 Selection of Doses in the Study
The preliminary results of the 3-month Phase 2a dose finding, POC Study indicate that 
elagolix 300 mg BID was the most effective dose in reducing HMB associated with uterine fibroids.  The 6-month Phase 2b safety /efficacy study confirmed these results and 
also demonstrated that E2/NETA (estradiol 1.0 mg/nor ethindrone acetate 0.5 mg) QD was 
effective in preventing BMD loss and ameliorating vasomotor symptoms due to estrogen suppression.  The data (PK/PD) from the multiple ascending dose (MAD) and folliculogenesis studies in healthy subjects also provide additional support for the targeted elagolix dose.  All of these studies have d emonstrated an acceptable safety and tolerability 
profile to date.
Based on the totality of safety and efficacy data, elagolix 300 mg BID with E2/NETA 
(estradiol 1.0 mg/norethindrone acetate 0.5 m g) QD was selected for further evaluation in 
Phase 3.  The maximum elagolix dose administered in this study will not exceed a total daily dose of 600 mg.
6.0 Complaints

All adverse events will be followed to a satisfactory conclusion.
6.1 Medical Complaints
The investigator will monitor each subject for clinical and laboratory evidence of adverse 
events on a routine basis throughout the study.  The investigator will assess and record any adverse event in detail including the date of onset, event diagnosis (if known) or sign/symptom, severity, time course (end date, ongoing, intermittent), relationship of the adverse event to study drug, and any action(s) taken.  For serious adverse events considered as having "no reasonable possibility" of being associated with study drug, the investigator will provide an Other cause of the event.  For adverse events to be considered intermittent, the events must be of similar nat ure and severity.  Adverse events, whether in 
response to a query, observed by site personnel, or reported spontaneously by the subject will be recorded.
6.1.1 Definitions
6.1.1.1 Adverse Event
An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or 
clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this  treatment.  An adverse event can therefore 
be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not the event is considered causally related to the use of the product.
Such an event can result from use of the drug as stipulated in the protocol or labeling, as 
well as from accidental or intentional ove rdose, drug abuse, or drug withdrawal.  Any 
worsening of a pre-existing condition or illne ss is considered an adverse event.  
Worsening in severity of a reported adverse event should be reported as a new adverse event.  Laboratory abnormalities, and vital signs are considered to be adverse events only if they result in discontinuation from the study, necessitate therapeutic medical intervention and/or if the investigator considers them to be adverse events.
Elagolix (ABT-620)
M12-817 Protocol Amendment 2
131
An adverse event of amenorrhea will be reported for subjects who do not return to menses 
by the Post-Treatment Follow-up Month 2 Phone Visit and the adverse event will be followed until resolution.  The onset date of the adverse event will be the date of the Follow-up Month 2 Visit.  
A BMD decrease at any anatomic lo cation (spine, to tal hip or femoral neck) during the 
Treatment or Post-Treatment Follow-up period that leads to discontinuation from study or 
a BMD decrease at any anatomic lo cation with a T-score < – 1.5 should be reported as an 
adverse event.
An elective surgery/procedure scheduled to occur during a study will not be considered an 
adverse event if the surgery/procedure is being performed for a pre-existing condition and the surgery/procedure has been pre planned prior to study entry.  However, if the pre-existing condition deteriorates unexpected ly during the study (e.g., surgery performed 
earlier than planned), then the deterioration of the condition for which the elective surgery/procedure is being done will be considered an adverse event.
6.1.1.2 Serious Adverse Events
If an adverse event meets any of the following criteria, it is to be reported to AbbVie as a 
serious adverse event (SAE) within 24 hours of the site being made aware of the serious adverse event.
Death of Subject An event that results in the death of a subject.
Life-Threatening An event that, in the opinion of the investigator, would have 
resulted in immediate fatality if medical intervention had not 
been taken.  This does not include an event that would have 
been fatal if it had occurred in a more severe form.
Hospitalization or 
Prolongation of 
HospitalizationAn event that results in an admission to the hospital for any 
length of time or prolongs the subject's hospital stay.  This 
does not include an emergency room visit or admission to an 
outpatient facility.
Congenital Anomaly An anomaly detected at or after birth, or any anomaly that 
results in fetal loss.
Elagolix (ABT-620)
M12-817 Protocol Amendment 2
132
Persistent or 
Significant 
Disability/IncapacityAn event that results in a condition that substantially 
interferes with the activities of d aily living of a study subject.  
Disability is not intended to include experiences of relatively 
minor medical significance such as headache, nausea, 
vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma 
(e.g., sprained ankle).
Important Medical 
Event Requiring 
Medical or Surgical Intervention to 
Prevent Serious 
OutcomeAn important medical event that may not be immediately 
life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization, but based 
on medical judgment may jeopardize the subject and may 
require medical or surgical intervention to prevent any of the 
outcomes listed above (i.e., death of subject, life-threatening, 
hospitalization, prolongation of hospitalization, congenital 
anomaly, or persistent or significant disability/incapacity).  
Additionally, any elective or spontaneous abortion or 
stillbirth is considered an important medical event.  Examples of such events include allergic bronchospasm requiring 
intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, bl ood 
dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient 
hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.
For serious adverse events with the outcome of death, the date and cause of death will be 
recorded on the appropriate case report form.
6.1.1.3 Adverse Events of Special Interest
Some adverse events, such as adverse events of special interest (AESI), such as 
rash/hypersensitivity, fracture, neuro-p sychiatric (de pression, mood swings, etc.), 
vasomotor symptoms (hot flush, night sweats) or serious adverse events.  AbbVie may require additional information, including family history, to be collected and recorded in the eCRF.
6.1.2 Adverse Event Severity
The investigator will use the following definitions to rate the severity of each adverse 
event:
Elagolix (ABT-620)
M12-817 Protocol Amendment 2
133
Mild The adverse event is transient and easily tolerated by the subject.
Moderate The adverse event causes the subject discomfort and interrupts the 
subject's usual activities.
Severe The adverse event causes considerable interference with the subject's usual activities and may be incapacitating or life-threatening.
6.1.3 Relationship to Study Drug
The investigator will use the following definitions to assess the relationship of the adverse 
event to the use of study drug:
Reasonable 
PossibilityAn adverse event where there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the study drug and the adverse event.
No Reasonable PossibilityAn adverse event where there is no evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the study drug and the adverse event.
For causality assessments, events assessed as having a reasonable possibility of being 
related to the study drug will be considered "associated."  Events assessed as having no reasonable possibility of being related to study drug will be considered "not associated."  In addition, when the investigator has not re ported a causality or deemed it not assessable, 
AbbVie will consider the event associated.
If an investigator's opinion of no reasonable possibility of being related to study drug is 
given, an "Other" cause of event must be provided by the investigator for the serious 
adverse event.
6.1.4 Adverse Event Collection Period
All adverse events reported from the time of study drug administration through Month 6 
or Month 12 in the Post-Treatment Follow-Up Period, (if applicable) will be collected, whether solicited or spontaneously reported by the subject.  In addition, serious adverse events and protocol-related nonserious adve rse events will be collected from the time the 
subject signed the study-specific informed consent.
Elagolix (ABT-620)
M12-817 Protocol Amendment 2
134
If a subject prematurely discontinues from the study, i.e., either prematurely discontinues 
from Treatment Period and does not enter the Post-Treatment Follow-Up Period or prematurely discontinues from the Post-Treatment Follow-Up Period, adverse events and serious adverse events will be collected up to 30 days after the last dose of study drug.
Adverse event information will be collected as shown in Figure 6 .
Figure 6. Adverse Event Collection
6.1.5 Adverse Event Reporting

6.1.6 Pregnancy
Pregnancy in a study subject must be reported to AbbVie within 1 working day of the site 
becoming aware of the pregnancy.  Subjects who become pregnant during the Treatment or Post-Treatment Follow-Up Periods of the study must be discontinued (Section 5.4and 
Section 5.4.1).  A positive urine pregnancy test result must be confirmed with a serum 
pregnancy test.  If a serum pregnancy test re sult is positive at any time during the 
Treatment Period of the study, the site will immediately inform the subject to discontinue 
study drug.  Information regarding a pregnancy occurrence in a study subject and the outcome of the pregnancy will be collected for any study subject with a positive serum pregnancy test from the signing of the informed consent (i.e., washout [if applicable]) or screening) through the Post-Treatment Follow-Up Period.  The site will report a positive pregnancy test to the Sponsor, will follow the course of the subject's pregnancy, and report to the Sponsor on the health of the subject and fetus at each trimester and at the first post-delivery pediatrician visit.
If the subject becomes pregnant during the Treatment or Post-Treatment Follow-Up 
Periods of the study, an ultrasound examinatio n will be performed as early as possible 
during the first trimester of pregnancy to assess the conception date and document an intrauterine pregnancy.  The following informat ion on the outcome of the pregnancy that 
occurred after signing of the informed consent, regardless of when the subject became pregnant (i.e., either during the Washout, Screening, Treatment or Post-Treatment Follow-Up Periods) should be collected:  fetal outcome (e.g., spontaneous or elective abortion, live infant or still birth), date of deliver y, birth weight, birth length, gender, birth 
Elagolix (ABT-620)
M12-817 Protocol Amendment 2
137
defects, congenital anomaly and medically significant complications during pregnancy or 
labor or delivery.  For live infant births, inform ation on the health of the infant will be 
collected 6 to 12 months after delivery.
Pregnancy in a study subject is not considered an adverse event.  However, the medical 
outcome of an elective or spontaneous abortion, stillbirth or congenital anomaly is considered a serious adverse event and must be reported to AbbVie within 24 hours of the site becoming aware of the event.
6.2 Product Complaint
6.2.1 Definition
A Product Complaint is any Complaint (see Section 6.0for the definition) related to the 
biologic or drug component of the product.
For a product this may include, but is not limited to, damaged/broken product or 
packaging, product appearance whose color/markings do not match the labeling, labeling discrepancies/inadequacies in the labeling/instructions (e.g., printing illegible), missing components/product, or packaging issues.
Any information available to help in the determination of causality by the product to the 
events outlined directly above should be captured.
6.2.2 Reporting
Product Complaints concerning the investigational product must be reported to the 
Sponsor within 24 hours of the study site's knowledge of the event via the Product Complaint form.  Product Complaints occurring during the study will be followed-up to a 
satisfactory conclusion.  All follow-up informatio n is to be reported to the Sponsor (or an 
authorized representative) and recorded in source documents as required by the Sponsor.  Product Complaints associ ated with adverse even ts will be reported in the study summary.

8.0 Statistical Methods and Determination of Sample 
Size
8.1 Statistical and Analytical Plans
8.1.1 General Considerations
The SAS system will be used to perform the statistical analyses.  All statistical tests will 
be two-sided and a significance level of 0.05 will be used unless otherwise specified.  A test will be deemed statistically significant if the Pvalue rounded to three decimal places 
is less than or equal to 0.05 unless otherwise specified.  The primary safety and efficacy comparisons will be between the elagolix 300 mg BID plus E2/NETA treatment group and the placebo group.  Comparisons between the elagolix 300 mg BID alone treatment 
group and the placebo group are provided for a reference.
8.1.2 Data Sets Analyzed
Modified Intent-to-Treat (mITT) Analysis Set
The modified intent-to-treat (mITT) analysis set is comprised of all randomized subjects 
who took at least one dose of the study drug and have at least one post-baseline visit in 
this study.  The mITT analysis set will be used for all efficacy analyses unless otherwise specified in the Statist ical Analy sis Plan (SAP).
Safety Analysis Set
The safety analysis set includes all randomized subjects who took at least one dose of the study drug.  The data from the safety analysis set will be presented by the treatment actually received no matter what treatment group was assigned at the time of randomization.  If a sub ject takes more than one treatment, the subject will be analyzed in 
the safety analysis set as taking the treatment to which she is randomized to.  All safety analyses will be performed based on the safety analysis set unless otherwise specified in the SAP.
Elagolix (ABT-620)
M12-817 Protocol Amendment 2
140
8.1.3 End-of-Treatment Period Analysis
An end-of-treatment period analysis of the primary and secondary efficacy variables along 
with demographic and safety variables w ill be performed after the last subject rando mized 
in this study completes the 6-Month Treatment Period of Study M12-817.  This end-of-treatment period analysi s will include all treatment period data from all patients 
randomized into the study.  The data base will be versioned and any discrepant data will be clarified before the lock.  Analyses will be performed by an external Independent Data Analysis Center (IDAC).  Subjects completing Study M12-817 are eligible to be enrolled in the double-blind extension study.  The blinding at the subject level for the extension study will be maintained as the efficacy da ta analyses will only present overall treatment 
group results to the sponsor.  The sponsor will have access to the unblinded results at the treatment group level.  However, the blinded data at the subject level will not be included in the results of the demogra phic, efficacy, or safety endpoints provided to the sponsor.  
The randomization schedule for Study M12-817 will be provided to the IDAC by someone other than the project statistician, who is otherwise not involved with this study.  All AbbVie study personnel will remain blinded until the blind is broken for the double-blind extension study.  The end-of-treatment period analysis will only include data collected during the 6-month treatment period of the study and will not include data collected during the post-treatment follow-up period.
Since this end-of-treatment period analysis is the only and final analysis of the primary 
and ranked secondary endpoints of Study M12-817, no adjustment of alpha-level is 
necessary.
8.1.4 Independent Data Monitoring Committee
The IDMC will receive an analysis summary by treatment group, which will include data 
on enrollment, baseline characteristics, and safety.
Elagolix (ABT-620)
M12-817 Protocol Amendment 2
141
8.1.5 Demographic, Baseline Characteristics and Concomitant 
Medications
Demographic and baseline characteristics will be summarized by treatment group.
Overall comparability among treatment groups will be performed using the following 
methods:  a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with treatment group as the main effect for continuous variables, Fisher's exact test (or its generalization to r × c tables) for qualitative categorical variables and the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) row mean scores test for ordered categorical variables.
Medical history will be summarized by condition/diagnosis by treatment group (no 
treatment group comparisons will be made).  The duration of the study drug exposure will be summarized by treatment group.
Protocol deviations and reasons for discontinuation will be summarized.Concomitant medications will be coded using the World Health Organization (WHO) 
dictionary and summarized with frequencies and percentages.
The baseline MBL volume will be defined as the mean of MBL volume from the qualified 
menstrual cycles during the Screening Period prior to the first study drug dose date, in which the total MBL volume is from all validated and non-validated sanitary products that subjects returned and where the total MBL volume of validated sanitary products only (excluding non-validated sanitary products) is greater than 80 mL.  All menstrual cycles during the Screening Period in which the total MBL volume of validated sanitary products only is less than or equal to 80 mL are not qualified to be considered for baseline.  The 
baseline for bleeding days will be based on the assessments from the qualified menstrual cycles that are used to calculate the baseline MBL volume.
The baseline values for other variables will be defined as the last non-missing assessment 
obtained prior to the initiation of the study drug unless otherwise specified.
Elagolix (ABT-620)
M12-817 Protocol Amendment 2
142
8.1.6 Time Points, Time Windows and Time Periods for Analysis
As appropriate, time windows for various safety and efficacy analyses will be defined in 
the SAP.
For randomized subjects who received at least one dose of the study drug, Study Day is 
defined as the number of days since (positive values) or prior (negative values) to the first study drug dose.  The day of the first study drug dose is defined as Study Day 1, while the last day prior to the first study drug dose is defined as Study Day –1.  There is 
no Study Day 0.
8.1.7 Efficacy
8.1.7.1 Primary Efficacy Variable
8.1.7.1.1 Primary Analysis
The primary analysis of the primary endpoint will be performed using the mITT analysis 
set.
The primary endpoint will be the percentage of subjects meeting a composite endpoint 
consisting of two bleeding assessments:
●Menstrual blood loss (MBL) volume < 80 mL during the Final Month (the last 
28 days of treatment), and
●50% or greater reduction in MBL volume from baseline to the Final Month 
(the last 28 days of treatment).
A subject who prematurely discontinues the study drug due to adverse events, "lack of 
efficacy," or "requires surgery or invasive in tervention for treatment of uterine fibroids" 
will be considered as a non-responder regardless whether she meets the two aforementioned responder criteria or not.
Baseline MBL volume is described in Section 8.1.5.  The Final Month is defined as the 
last 28 days of treatment prior to and including the last dose date.
Elagolix (ABT-620)
M12-817 Protocol Amendment 2
143
The MBL volume used for the primary and sens itivity analyses is defined as the total 
combined volume of blood ascertained via the AH method from all used (validated and 
non-validated) sanitary products that a subject returns.  In case a subject does not return any used sanitary products and indicates on the UBQ that she experienced bleeding during the Final Month, the MBL volume will be imputed per the procedure described in Section8.1.7.1.2 .
The primary endpoint will be analyzed using a logistic regression model including treatment as the main effect and baseline MBL volume as a covariate.
8.1.7.1.2 Derivation of Primary Efficacy Endpoint
The Final Month MBL volume will be derived as follows:
●If a subject has any AH data reported during the Final Month (i.e., she has at 
least 1 day of AH data during the last 28 days of treatment), then her primary 
endpoint will be based on AH data during th e Final Month.  The subject's Final 
Month MBL volume will be the total MBL volume which is the sum of the observed MBL volume over the last 28 days of treatment.
●If a subject is missing the Final Month AH data and the Uterine Bleeding Questionnaire is completed, then;
●A value of 0 will be assigned to the Final Month MBL volume if no bleeding or spotting, "Subject only had spotting that did not require the use of sanitary 
products" or "There was no visible blood on the sanitary products" is indicated 
on the Uterine Bleeding Questionnaire ( Appendix G ).
●Otherwise, the primary endpoint will be imputed using multiple imputation as described in Section 8.1.7.1.3 .
A flow-chart showing how the primary endpoint will be derived is presented in Figure 7 .

Figure 7. Flow-Chart for Deriving Primary Endpoint 
8.1.7.1.3 Multiple Imputation
The imputation model will include but is not limited to the following variables:  baseline
MBL volume, treatment group, and 28-day MBL volume at each post-baseline treatment cycle.  The final imputation model will be specified in the SAP.
First, M"semi-complete" datasets will be imputed to produce monotone missing data via 
MCMC using SAS PROC MI.  Then, M "complete" datasets for the Final Month MBL 
volume will be generated based on each "semi-complete" dataset via linear regression using SAS PROC MI.  Mrepresents the number of imputed datasets and its value will be 
specified in the SAP.

Elagolix (ABT-620)
M12-817 Protocol Amendment 2
145
Each subject's responder status will be derived based on the imputed Final Month MBL 
volume from the Mimputed datasets.  And the percentages of responders are analyzed 
using a logistic regression model including treatment as the main effect and baseline MBL volume as a covariate.
8.1.7.1.4 Sensitivity Analysis of the Primary Efficacy Variable
The sensitivity analyses for the primary endpoint will use different approaches for 
handling prematurely discontinued subjects and different approaches for dealing with missing Final Month MBL volume.  The details of the sensitivity analyses will be specified in the SAP.
Unless otherwise specified, the analysis dataset used for sensitivity analysis is the mITT 
analysis set.
8.1.7.2 Secondary Efficacy Variables
Ranked secondary efficacy measures during the Treatment Period include the following 
(the order of the ranked secondary efficacy endpoints will be specified in the SAP):
●Change from baseline in MBL volume to the Final Month;
●Monthly change from baseline in MBL volume;
●Percentage of subjects with suppression of bleeding (no bleeding allowed, 
spotting allowed) at the Final Month;
●Percentage of subjects with baseline hemoglobin ≤ 10.5 g/dL who have an
increase in hemoglobin > 2 g/dL at Month 6.
Non-ranked secondary efficacy measures during the Treatment Period include the 
following:
●Change and percent change from baseline in MBL volume;
●Percentage of subjects with MBL volume < 80 mL and 50% or greater
reduction in MBL volume from baseline during 28-day intervals throughout the Treatment Period;

●Change from baseline for the UFS-QoL; 
●Change from baseline for the EuroQoL-5D (EQ-5D-5L);
●The HCRU;
●Change from baseline for the WPAI.
Statistical Analyses for Secondary Efficacy Variables
For continuous variables, including change from baseline analyses, treatment group 
differences will be analyzed as appropriate using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) models with treatment group as the main effect and baseline score as a covariate.  Additionally, the mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) method for change from baseline to each post-baseline assessment during the Treatment Period will be conducted as appropriate.
Categorical data will be analyzed using CMH test, chi-square, Fisher's exact test or 
logistics regression as appropriate.
For the ranked secondary variables, a fixed-sequence approach will be applied to maintain 
the family-wise type I error rate.
Analysis details will be specified in the SAP.
8.1.7.2.1 Reduction of Bleeding
The percentage of subjects with MBL volume < 80 mL and 50% or greater reduction in 
MBL volume from bas eline during the Treatment Period will be summarized for each

used to analyze treatment group differences for qualitative categorical variables unless 
otherwise specified.
Missing safety data will not be imputed.Analysis details will be specified in the SAP.
8.1.8.2 Adverse Events
Adverse events (AEs) will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory 
Activities (MedDRA) dictionary.  Treatment- emergent adverse events (TEAEs) w ill be 
summarized for each treatment group.  TEAEs are defined as AEs with a start date on or after the first dose of the study drug and within 30 days of the last dose of the study drug.  AEs starting more than 30 days following discontinuation of the study drug will not be included in the summaries of TEAEs.  AEs starting more than 30 days following discontinuation of the study drug will be summarized separately as Post-Treatment AEs.
When summarizing TEAEs by relationship or severity, if a subject has an event with 
unknown severity or relationship, then the subject will be counted in the severity/relationship category of "unknown," even if the subject has a second occurrence of the same event with a severity/relationship present.  The only exception is if the subject 
has a second occurrence of the same event with the most extreme severity (i.e., "severe") or a relationship category of "reasonable possib ility."  In this case, the subject will be 
counted under these most extreme severity/relationship categories.
Frequencies and percentages of subjects with TEAEs will be calculated for each treatment 
group as follows:
●Any event
●By system organ class, and preferred term
●By system organ class, preferred term and maximum relationship
●By system organ class, preferred term and maximum severity
Elagolix (ABT-620)
M12-817 Protocol Amendment 2

●Any event and by system organ class and preferred term for events resulting in 
study drug discontinuation
●Any event and by system organ class and preferred term for serious events
●Any event and preferred term for AESI's (e.g., hypoestrogenic adverse events)
The Post-Treatment AEs will be summarized in a similar manner as the TEAEs described 
above.
8.1.8.3 Analysis of Laboratory Data and Vital Signs
Changes from the baseline to each visit in continuous laboratory and vital sign parameters 
will be summarized by tr eatment group.  Treatment group differences for changes from 
baseline will be analyzed using a one-way ANOVA with treatment as  the main effect.
Laboratory values will be categorized as low, normal or high based on normal ranges of the central laboratory used in this study.  Low or high laboratory values will be flagged in the data listings.  
Analysis details will be specified in the SAP.

8.1.9 Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic Analysis
Plasma concentrations of elagolix and norethindrone and serum concentrations of 
estradiol, progesterone, luteinizing hormone and follicle stimulating hormone will be listed for each subject by visit day and dose regimen, as applicable.  Pharmacokinetic data may be combined with data from other st udies in women.  Exposure-response analyses 
may be conducted as appropriate.  For example, if pharmacokinetic exposures are estimated, analyses may be conducted to assess the relationship of pharmacokinetic parameters and estradiol and progesterone con centrations, versus efficacy and safety.  
Additional analyses will be performed if useful and appropriate.
8.2 Determination of Sample Size
Approximately 400 subjects will be randomized in a 1:1:2 ratio to placebo (N = 100), 
elagolix 300 mg BID (N = 100), or elagolix 300 mg BID plus E2/NETA (N = 200).  The sample size will provide at least 90% power to detect a difference between the elagolix 300 mg BID plus E2/NETA group and the placebo group in the percentage of subjects with MBL volume < 80 mL during the Final Month (the last 28 days of treatment) and 50% or greater reduction in MBL volume from baseline to the Final Month under the assumption of responder rates being 60% and 30% for elagolix 300 mg BID plus E2/NETA and placebo, respectively.  The sample size determination is primarily driven by the need for a sufficient number of patients for the safety database.  The above sample size was calculated using nQuery advisor 7.0.

9.3 Subject Information and Consent
The investigator or his/her representative will explain the nature of the study to the 
subject, and answer all questions regarding this study.  Prior to any study-related screening procedures being performed on the subject, the informed consent statement will be reviewed and signed and dated by the subject, the person who administered the informed consent, and any other signatories according to local requirements.  A copy of the informed consent form will be given to the subject and the original will be placed in the subject's medical record.  An entry must also be made in the subject's dated source documents to confirm that informed consent was obtained prior to any study-related procedures and that the subject received a signed copy.
Information regardi ng incentives for subjects and i nformation regarding provisions for 
treating and/or compensating subjects who are harmed as a consequence of participation 
in the study can be found in the informed consent form.
Pharmacogenetic samples (DNA and RNA) will only be collected if the subject has 
voluntarily signed and dated a separate pharmacogenetic informed consent, approved by an IRB/IEC, after the nature of the testing has been explained and the subject has had an opportunity to ask questions.  The separate pharmacogenetic informed consent must be 
signed before the pharmacogenetic testing is performed.  If the subject does not consent to the pharmacogenetic testing, it will not impact the subject's participation in the study.

appropriate source documents.
The investigator(s)/institution(s) will per mit study-related monitoring, audits, IEC/IRB 
review, and regulatory inspection(s), providing direct access to source data documents.
10.2 Case Report Forms
Case report forms (CRF) must be completed for each subject screened/enrolled in this 
study.  These forms will be used to tran smit information collected during the study to 
AbbVie and regulatory authorities, as applicable.  The CRF data for this study are being collected with an electronic data capture (EDC) system called Rave
®provided by the 
technology vendor Medidata Solutions Incorporated, NY, USA.  The EDC system and the study-specific electronic case report forms (eCRFs) will comply with Title 21 CFR Part 11.  The documentation related to the validation of the EDC system is available through the vendor, Medidata, while the valid ation of the study-specific eCRFs will be 
conducted by AbbVie and will be maintained in the Trial Master File at AbbVie.
The investigator will document subject data in his/her own subject files.  These subject 
files will serve as source data for the study.  All eCRF data required by this protocol will be recorded by investigative site personnel in the EDC system.  All data entered into the eCRF will be supported by source documentation.
The investigator or an authorized member of the investigator's staff will make any 
necessary corrections to the eCRF.  All change information, including the date and person 
performing the corrections, will be available via the audit trail, which is part of the EDC system.  For any correction, a reason for the alteration will be provided.  The eCRFs will be reviewed periodically for completeness, legibility, and acceptability by AbbVie personnel (or their representatives).  AbbVie (or their representatives) will also be allowed access to all source documents pertinent to the st udy in order to verify eCRF entries.  The 
principal investigator will review the eCRFs for completeness and accuracy and provide his or her electronic signature and date to eCRFs as evidence thereof.

Medidata will provide access to the EDC system for the duration of the trial through a 
password-protected method of internet access.  Such access will be removed from investigator sites at the end of the site's participation in the study.  Data from the EDC system will be archived on appropriate data media (CD-ROM, etc.) and provided to the investigator at that time as a durable record of the site's eCRF data.  It will be possible for the investigator to make paper printouts from that media.
Patient reported data must be completed for each subject screened/enrolled in this study
and entered into the eCRFs.  
11.0 Data Quality Assurance
Computer logic and manual checks will be created  to identify items such as inconsistent 
study dates.  Any necessary correcti ons will be made to the eCRF.
Prior to enrolling any subject in the study, a Site Training Visit will be held with AbbVie personnel (and/or their representatives), the investigators, and the appropriate site personnel.  This meeting will include a detailed discussion and review of the protocol and essential documents, performance of study procedures, eCRF completion, and specimen collection methods.  The personnel at the study site will be trained on the study procedures, when applicable, by an AbbVie monitor or designee.
The AbbVie monitor or designee will monitor the study site throughout the study.  A 
source document review will be performed against entries on the eCRFs and a quality assurance check will be performed to ensure that the investigator is complying with the protocol and regulations.  In addition, ongoing re view of the data will be conducted by a 
physician or representative at AbbVie.
Data entered into eCRFs will be electronically transferred to AbbVie and imported into 
the database using validated software throughout the study.  Computer logic checks will be run to identify such items as inconsis tent study dates.  Any necessary corrections will 
be made to the eCRF.

e. A positive urine pregnancy test result must be confirmed with a quantitative serum pregnancy test.  For any subject who has a  positive serum pregnancy test result, a TVU 
must be performed during the first trimester of pregnancy to assess the gestational age and estimated date of delivery.  The si te will immediately inform the subject to 
discontinue study drug and the subject will be discontinued from the study at the point the pregnancy is confirmed.
f. Home pregnancy test kit will be self-administered at home by the subject.
g. Subject should return sanitary products within approximately 5 days after cessation of bleeding or spotting from the first menses with full menstrual flow in the Post-
Treatment Follow-up Period at a Product Collection Visit or a scheduled site visit. The venous blood sample will be sent with c ollected products to the Alkaline Hematin 
laboratory.  If the subject misses collecting sanitary products for her first full menses, she will be required to collect sani tary products for her next full menses.  
h. Subjects are required to continuethe use of two forms of non-hormonal birth control throughout the Post-Treatment Follow-Up P eriod (After Month 2 in the Post-Treatment 
Follow-Up Period, provided the subject returned to menses, the subject may begin the use of hormonal contraception in place of non-hormonal birth control).
i. Post-Treatment UBQ will only be completed if Subject has not returned sanitary products for her first full menses in the Post -Treatment Period at the time of the Phone or Site 
visit.  Once a Subject returns sanitary products from her first full menses in the Post-Treatment Follow-up Period, the Post-Tr eatment UBQ no longer needs to be completed.
j. An adverse event of amenorrhea will be reported for subjects who do not return to menses by the Post-Treatment Follow-up Mont h 2 Phone Visit and the adverse event will 
be followed until resolution.

1 Section 3 : Study Endpoints:  
All assessments are r elative to baseline 
assessments performed during the Study PT010006 Screening Period (between Visit 1 and Visit 3 4) To clarify Screening Period is 
considered between Visit 1 and Visit 4 and not between Visit 1 and Visit 3 in this section and throughout the document for consistency 
2 Section 4.1  Overall Study Design and Plan
Baseline and demographic characteristics 
collected in Study PT010006 will be used for subjects participating in this study. Baseline assessments ( BMD, lenticular 
opacity, fundoscopic examination, intraocular pressure , pupil dilation,  and 
visual acuity assessments) will be performed prior to randomization in 
Study PT010006. If the  first two BMD 
scans differ by m ore than 5% (as 
determined by the l ocal facility) for 
either site (i.e. first  two hip or first two 
lumbar sites) a third scan should be 
obtained .The screening period may be 
extended up to a maximum of 21 days if 
additional time is n eeded to complete the 
assessments during Study PT010006 
Screening Period (between Visit 1 and 
Visit 4). A separate informed consent will 
be obtained for subjects participating in 
Study PT010008 prior to any study 
PT010008 procedures .start of Study 
PT010006.
Subjects participating in Study PT010008 
who complete visit 10a of Study PT010006 will transition to the remaining 28 weeks of To clarify how the s can information will 
be analyzed, to allow adequate time to 
complete assessments during the screening period, and to ensure consistency across study section and sites

criteria will be excluded from the study(please see the exception noted below theophthalmologic criteria Section 5.2.2 ).
Section 5.2.1  Bone Mineral Density 
Criteria applied to either hip or lumbar
region
1. Severe osteoarthritis osteoporosis
2. T-score < -2.5 at baseline
3. Added : Subjects unable to achieve an
acceptable scan (e.g. due to the
patient’s inability to be stable duringthe procedure, due  to limitation of
scanning equipment to accommodatea subject ( ~300lbs or ~136kgs) or
other characteristics) .Added reference to exclusion criteria

8 Section 7.1 Bone Mineral Density 
Assessments 
Bone mineral density will be evaluated by 
taking two sets of DEXA scans (lumbar 
spine and hip regions) prior to 
randomization (Study PT010006 Visit 4
) within 14 days prior to baseline 
(Screening Visits 1 to 4 in Study 
PT010006) and within 14 days prior to and 
Visit 14 (Week 52) in this study . After the 
first scan, of the lumbar spine and hip 
region, the subject will get up from the 
table, and be repositioned, and another 
scan taken to take anot her set of scans at 
these skeletal sites . If these first two scans 
differ by more than 5%  (as determined by 
the local facility) for either site (i.e. first 
two hip or first two lumbar sites)   a third 
scan should be obtained. The screening 
period may be extended up to a To clarify how the  scan information 
will be analyzed, allow adequate time to complete assessments during the screening period and to ensure consistency across study sites

maximum of 21 days if additional time is 
needed to complete the assessments. The 
results of these scans w ill be provided by 
the central testin g facility to the 
investigative site t o allow appropriate 
management of the subject
If a subject’s T score is < 2.5 For any 
clinically relevant reduction in T-score ,
the investigator should consider appropriate tr eatment options based on 
local guidelines  for the subject and/or refer 
them to their local medical doctor or a specialist for treatment. If subsequently 
treated with bisphosphonates, the subject 
should be excluded from further BMD 
measures in this study If a subject’s T-
score (hip or lumba r spine) is <-2.5 at 
screening they are excluded . 
Both the lumbar spine L2-L4 and total hip 
bone density will be measured. The 2scans 
of each skeletal site will be centrally 
analyzed and averaged  to obtain the final 
result to be used for data analysis . The 
results of these scans w ill be relayed by the 
local facility to the investigator to allow 
appropriate management of the subject

manual
9 Section 7.2 Ophthalmologic Assessments
1. The baseline ophthalmologic 
assessment must be performed prior to 
randomization  between Visits 1 and 4 
(Screening) of Study PT010006. Two 
post-baseline ophthalmologic assessments will be pe rformed at Visit 
11 (Week 28), and within 14 days 
prior to  Visit 14 (Week 52) only per 
exclusion criteria exception noted in 
Section 5.2.2 . These post-baseline 
ophthalmologic assessments should be scheduled to occur within two weeks For #1, Added consistency with respect 
to baseline assessment being conducted prior to randomization and within 14 days and concept for Visit 14 removed to correct an error for this study. For the two post-baselin e ophthalmic 
assessments added clarification to refer to the exclusion criteria exception noted 
in Section 5.2.2
For #2 and # 3, Included pupil dilation 
and clarified that a certified LOCSIII trained ophthalmologist /optometrist could conduct assessments

Budesonide, Glycopyrronium, and Formoterol Fumarate Inhalation Aerosol Pearl Therapeutics, Inc. 
Clinical Trial Protocol:  PT010008-01 Version 2.0,
prior to the scheduled clinic visit. Due 
to diurnal variability of IOP, all ophthalmic examinations  following the 
first ophthalmic examination (screening  baseline) should be 
scheduled to occur within two hours of 
the time of day when the baseline ophthalmic examination was performed. The same ophthalmologist should perform the ophthalmic examinations for a g iven subject at all 
visits if possible, to e nsure consistency.  
2. At participating centers, all subjects 
will be referred to a precertified 
LOCSIII trained 
ophthalmologist/optometrist for 
evaluation of pupil dilation , lenticular 
opacities, fundoscopic examination, intraocular pressure (IOP), manifest refraction and visual acuity. This data will also be categorized as normal/abnormal.  
3. The Lens Opacities Classification 
System (LOCS) III grading system will be used to assess lenticular opacities in this study. The following assessments will be performed usin g a decimalized 
scale ranging from 0.1 (indicating acompletely clear or c olorless lens) to 
either 5.9 (indicating complete opacification on the cortex or posterior capsule for C or P scales) or 6.9 (indicating advanced opacification and brunescence of the nucleus for NO or NC scales). Each assessment will be recorded to the nearest 0.1 as determined by the certified
ophthalmologist/ optometrist . 
4. Moved the “NOTE: The 
ophthalmologist/optometrist must not refer to prior LOCS III grades and LOGMAR visual acuities from For #4 The Note moved with the LOCS 
III assessment to add relevance For #5 Eligibility criteria clarified with respect to the reading to be considered.

each 4-week interval of the  52-week Treatment Period
Statistical Methods:   
Primary Analysis for BMD Endpoint : 
Analyses of BMD endpoints w ill be conducted on those randomized  subjects who have both 
baseline and post-baseline BMD results.
The change from baseline in BMD  of the lumbar spine at Week 52 will be analyzed using an 
Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) m odel with treatment group and gender as categorical 
covariates and baseline BMD, a ge, and the interaction between g ender and age as continuous 
covariates.
Primary Analysis for LOCS III Endpoint :  
Confidential and Proprietary Page 16 of 112
Budesonide, Glycopyrronium, and Formoterol Fumarate Inhalation Aerosol Pearl Therapeutics, Inc. 
Clinical Trial Protocol:  PT010008-01 Version 2.0,
Change from baseline in LOCS III (P) scores at Week 52 will be analyzed using an ANCOVA. 
The model will include treatme nt group as a fixed effect, and b aseline LOCS III (P) score, 
smoking pack years, and age as c ontinuous covariates. The model  will account for inter-eye 
correlation by including subject a nd eye (within subject) as ra ndom effects.
Two-sided 95% confidence interval s will be comput ed for pairwis e differences of BGF minus 
GFF and BFF minus GFF, and non-infe riority will be declared if the upper confidence bound is 
less than 0.5. 
Sample Size:   
Assuming a 15% rate of discon tinuation through Week 52, a subse t of 500 randomized subjects 
from the PT010006 study will provide 425 subjects with baseline  and on-treatment BMD and 
LOCS III. This sample size will  provide approximately 97% power  to demonstrate non-
inferiority of BGF MDI to GFF MDI in percent change from baseli ne in BMD for Lumbar Spine 
L2-L4 at Week 52 based on the low er limit of -2%, true differen ce of -0.3%, and SD of 4% and 
approximately 91% power  for the non-inferiority comparison of B FF MDI to GFF MDI under 
identical assumptions.  It will  provide over 99% power to demon strate non-inferiority of BGF 
MDI to GFF MDI (or BFF MDI to GFF MDI) in change from baseline in LOCS III Score (P) at 
Week 52 based on a margin of 0.5 or mor e (1-sided, alpha=0.025)  assuming no true difference in 
the means.
Data Monitoring and Clinical Endpoint Committees:   
Data Monitoring Committee :
An external Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) that was initiated in Study PT010006 will 
continue to provide s ystematic and unbiased assessment of safet y for Study PT010008.  
Members of the DMC will review d ata at predetermined intervals.   If significant safety issues 
arise in between scheduled mee tings, ad hoc meetings will be sc heduled to review the data. 
Based on the safety implications of the data, the DMC may recom mend modification or 
termination of the study.
Clinical Endpoint Committee : 
An external clinical endpoint committee (CEC) that was initiated i n Study PT010006 will 
continue to provide s ystematic and unbiased a ssessment of pre-d efined, Investigator reported 
adverse events for Study P T010008.  The committee will consist of experts who will provide a 
centralized review functioning i ndependently of Pearl. Three Cl inical Endpoint Adjudication 
Charters will outline the clinical endpoints for adjudication.
•Cardiovascular- and Cerebro-vas cular (CCV) Clinical Endpoint Ad judication Charter 
•Cause-Specific Mortality Clini cal Endpoint Adjud ication Charter  
•Pneumonia Clinical Endpoi nt Adjudication Charter

1 INTRODUCTION
Chronic obstructive pulmonary dis ease (COPD) is a common prevent able and treatable disease
characterized by persistent ai rflow limitation that is usually progressive and a ssociated with an 
enhanced chronic inflammatory r esponse in the airways and the l ung to noxious particles or

Chronic obstructive pulmonary dis ease is a leading cause of morb idity and mortality worldwide
and results in significant econo mic and social burden that is b oth substantial and increasing.  
Pharmacologic therapy in COPD is  used to reduce symptoms, reduce the frequency and severity 
of exacerbations, and improve hea lth status and exercise tolera nce [Global Initiative for Chronic 
Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD, 2014) ; Japanese Respiratory Society (JRS, 2013) .
Bronchodilator medications are cen tral to the symptomatic manag ement of COPD.  The principal 
EURQFKRGLODWRUWUHDWPHQWVDUHȕ 2-agonists, anticholinergics, and methylxanthines used as 
monotherapy or in combination.  Tr eatment with long-acting bron chodilators is more convenient 
and more effective at producing ma intained symptom relief than treatment with short-acting 
bronchodilators. 
Regular treatment with inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) improves s ymptoms, lung function, and 
quality of life and reduces the frequency of exacerbations in s ubjects with COPD with a forced 
expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV 1) value of <60% of predicte d.  Withdrawal from treatment 
of ICS may lead to exacerbations  in some patients.  When combin ed with a long-acting 
ȕ2-agonist (LABA), an ICS is more effective than the individual c omponents in improving lung 
function, quality of life, and re ducing exacerbations in subjec ts with moderate to very severe 
COPD [GOLD, 2014] .   
Pearl Therapeutics, Inc. (hereinafter referred to as Pearl) is developing the fixed-dose ICS/ long-
acting anti-muscarinic agent (LA MA)/LABA triple combination pro duct, Budesonide, 
Glycopyrronium, and Formoterol F umarate Inhalation Aerosol (PT0 10), hereafter referred to as 
budesonide, glycopyrronium, and f ormoterol fumarate metered dos e inhaler (BGF MDI), for the 
treatment of patients wi th COPD.  Budesonide and Formoterol Fum arate Inhalation Aerosol 
(PT009, hereinafter referred to a s budesonide and formoterol fu marate (BFF) MDI is also being 
developed as a twice daily (BID)  fixed dose ICS/LABA treatment for patients with COPD.
Glycopyrronium and Formoterol F umarate Inhalation Aerosol (PT00 3) hereinafter referred to as 
glycopyrronium and formoterol fuma rate (GFF) MDI is being develo ped as a BID maintenance 
bronchodilator treatment  in patients with COPD.
Budesonide is a well-establishe d corticosteroid a pproved worldw ide in monotherapy and 
combination therapies for treatme nt of asthma and allergic rhin itis.  It is available in both 
intranasal and orally inhaled f ormulations.  Inhaled budesonide  in combination with formoterol 
fumarate dihydrate, i.e., Symbic ort is approved for use in pati ents with COPD.  
Glycopyrronium is a LAMA whic h exerts its bronchodilatory effec t via muscarinic receptors 
located on smooth muscle cells w ithin the trachea and bronchi.  Glycopyrronium is approved in 
many countries in multiple formu lations for different indicatio ns, including for t he treatment of 
COPD.

1.1 Study Rationale 
Patients with COPD are frequently treated with ICS; the impact of ICS use on potential fracture 
risk is not consistent acr oss published literature [Lehouck, 2011; Weldon, 2009 ; Christensson,
2008] . Studies in adults with COPD ha ve produced a wide range of res ults in support of the 
direct effect of ICS on bone miner al density (BMD) and fracture  risk.
It has also been reported that c orticosteroid treatment can lea d to multiple ocular effects, 
including cataracts, increased i ntraocular pressure (IOP) and g laucoma. Furthermore, as the 
majority of the COPD population i s elderly, these observed ocul ar changes are more likely to be 
predominant in an elderly popul ation. For example, in the TORCH  safety sub-study, the 
background prevalence of cataracts was high in COPD patients (6 8.5-75.3% at Screening) 
[Calverley, 2007] .  
As a result of the increased o ccurrence of cataracts, IOP, and glaucoma and the increased risk of 
bone disorders in patients wit h COPD, definitive ocular and bon e mineral density assessments 
are included in this 1-year safety study.

4 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN
4.1 Overall Study Design and Plan 
This is a randomized, double-b lind, parallel-group, 52-week, ch ronic-dosing, multi-center 
supplemental study to assess the effects of PT010, PT009, and P T003 on bone mineral density 
(BMD), ocular assessments, and s afety and tolerability in subje cts with moderate to very severe 
COPD.  This 52-week study will be  conducted in a sub-set of sub jects participating in Study 
PT010006. Approximately 70 sites are  planned to participate in the study, contributing 
approximately 8 subjects per site .  Across these sites, it is pl anned that approximately 
500 subjects randomized to double-b lind treatment only will be included in Study PT010008 
to provide approximate ly (425) subjects who w ill complete the s tudy at Visit 14 (Week 52). 
Subjects will receive the same tr eatment (BGF MDI, GFF MDI, or BFF MDI) they were 
randomized to in Study PT010006. S ubjects randomized to open-lab el Symbicort TBH will not 
be enrolled in this study, howev er, since baseline BMD and ocul ar assessments will be 
performed prior to randomizati on all subjects who will eventual ly be randomized to Symbicort 
TBH will have a baselin e assessment. The entire study period is  scheduled to take approximately 
58 weeks for most subjects. 
This safety study will evaluate the effects of BGF MDI, BFF MDI , and GFF MDI on bone 
mineral density (BMD) measurement (Johnell, 2002 ) and lenticular opacity (Chylack, 1993 ) and 
ocular pressure assessments. 
Baseline and demographic charact eristics collected in Study PT0 10006 will be used for subjects 
participating in this study. Bas eline assessments (BMD, lenticu lar opacity, fundoscopic 
examination, intraocular pre ssure, pupil dilatation, and visual  acuity assessments) will be 
performed prior to randomizati on in Study PT010006.  If the fir st two BMD scans differ by more 
than 5% (as determined by the lo cal facility) for either site ( i.e. first two hip or  first two lumbar 
sites) a third scan should be obt ained. The screening period ma y be extended up to a maximum 
of 21 days if additional time is n eeded to complete the assessm ents. A separate informed consent 
will be obtained for subjects pa rticipating in Study PT010008 p rior to any study PT010008 
procedures.   
Subjects participating in Stu dy PT010008 who complete visit 10a  of Study PT010006 will 
transition to the remaining 28 week s of treatment by completing  Visit 10b (Week 24). Post-
baseline lenticular opacity, f undoscopic examination, intraocul ar pressure, and visual acuity 
assessments will be performed pr ior to Visit 11 (Week 28), Visi t 14 (Week 52) and Treatment 
Discontinuation/Withdrawal Vis it. A post-baseline BMD assessmen t will be performed prior to
Visit 14 (Week 52) and Treatment D iscontinuation/Withdrawal Vis it. Subjects will return to the 
clinic at Visit 12 (Week 36), a nd Visit 13 (Week 44) to return used medication and obtain new 
study drug. Subjects will retur n to the clinic a t Visit 14 (Wee k 52) to complete final study visit 
procedures. 
All subjects will continue to r eceive sponsor-provided Ventolin®HFA (albuterol sulfate 
inhalation aerosol) for resc ue use throughout the study. 
After Visit 14 (Week 52), a fo llow-up telephone call will be pe rformed at least 14 days after the 
last study drug dose. For subject s who withdraw consent, schedu le a follow-up telephone call at

least 14 days after the last stud y drug dosing, if the final vi sit is performed >14 days post last 
study drug dosing, a follo w-up TC will not be required.   
If a subject choos esnot to continue with study asse ssments, at a minimum the subjec t will 
complete the Treatment Discontinuation/Withdrawal Visit (refer to Table 8-1) . For subjects 
discontinuing treatment at any time during the study including the time during which they are 
participating in Study PT 010006, lenticular opacity, fundoscopi c examination, intraocular 
pressure, pupil dilation and visual  acuity assessments should b e performed as soon as possible.  
For subjects discontinuing tre atment after Visit 10b (Week 24),  BMD assessments should also be 
obtained as soon as possible (Not e: Subject who discontinues pr ior to Visit 10b will not complete 
BMD assessments).  These subjects will return to appropriate ma intenance COPD medications, 
per the investigators discretion . A follow-up telephone call will  be performed at least 14 days 
after the last study drug dose. I n the event the Treatment Disc ontinuation/Withdrawal Visit is 
performed >14 days post last study drug dosing, a follow-up TC will not be required. These 
subjects will be followed for v ital status at 52 weeks post-ran domization in accordance with the 
informed consent.

5.6 Smoking Status 
Changes in a subject’s smoking status (e.g., stopping or re-sta rting smoking) may have an 
impact on the efficacy outcome meas ures.  At all visits the sub ject will be asked about any 
recent change in their smoking s tatus (i.e., whether a subject’ s status has changed from 
smoker to non-smoker or vice versa) .  Smoking status changes du ring the 28-week Treatment 
Period will be captured in the e CRF, but the subject will be pe rmitted to continue in the 
study.  Subjects will be require d to refrain from smoking (incl uding medical marijuana and 
electronic cigarettes) for at least 4 hours prior to each study  visit and throughout the duration 
of each study visit.  Study par ticipants may utilize various ni cotine replacement treatments 
such as chewing gum and patches (PRN), in accordance with recom mendations from the 
Investigator during the entire study visit.
Note: Use of electronic cigarettes w ill be viewed and managed in the s ame manner as 
traditional smoking.
5.7 Reasons and Procedures for Early Discontinuation from the 
Study 
5.7.1 Reasons for Discontinuation
Subjects may be withdrawn from the study at any time at their o wn request, upon request of 
the Investigator, or by Pearl at any time or for any reason. A subject who withdraws consent 
will always be asked about the reason(s) and the p resence of an y adverse events (AE).   All 
subjects who discontinue for any  reason, or their family or hea lthcare providers, will be 
contacted 52 weeks post-Randomiza tion to determine vital status , and if appropriate, cause of 
death (Section 8.8) .    The subject may voluntarily disc ontinue treatment at any t ime without 
prejudice to further treatment.  If a subject experiences any o f the changes of concern listed 
below, a repeat assessment s hould be obtained, an d if confirmed , the Investigator or designee 
needs to make a determination a s to the suitability of continui ng the subject in the study.  The 
changes of concern include:
•Calculated QTcF intervals >500 msec, and have increased by 60 mse c or more over test 
day baseline value
•Following dosing, a heart rate i ncrease of >40 bpm from the pre -dose value obtained on 
that specific test day and the measured value is also >120 bpm 
•Following dosing, a systolic bl ood pressure incre ase of >40 mmH g from the

6.5 Emergency Unblinding of Treatment Assignment  
The IWRS should be used in orde r to unblind subjects and to unm ask drug identity.  When 
the Investigator contacts the  system to unblind a subject, he/s he must provide the requested 
subject identifying informati on and confirm the necessity to un blind the subject.  Pearl will 
not provide a disclosure envelope  with the clinical supplies. 
The Investigator or treating  physician may unblind a subject’s treatment assignment only in 
the case of an emergency , when knowledge of the study tr eatment is essential for the 
appropriate clinical managemen t or welfare of the subject.
Whenever possible, the Investigat or must first discuss options with the Medical Monitor or 
appropriate study personnel before unblinding the subject’s treatme nt assignment.  If this is 
impractical, the Investigator mus t notify Pearl as soon as poss ible, but without revealing the 
treatment assignment  of the unblinded subject, unless that info rmation is important for the 
safety of subjects currently i n the study.  The date and reason  for the unblinding must be 
recorded in the appropriat e data collection tool.

6.6 Storage Requirements
Blinded Supplies  should be kept in a secured location.  BGF MDI, GFF MDI, and B FF MDI 
should be stored below 25° C (77°  F) in a dry place.  Excursion s permitted up to 30° C (86° 
F).
Ventolin®HFA supplies: Store between 15°C and 25°C (59°F and 77°F).  Store the inhaler  
with the mouthpiece down.  For best  results, the inhaler should  be at room temperature 
before use.  Do not use or store  near heat or open flame.  Expo sure to temperatures above 
120°F (49°C) may cause bursting . Never throw into a fire or inc inerator. 
The clinical supplies storage ar ea at the site must be monitore d by the site staff for 
temperature consistency with the acceptable storage temperature  range specified in 
accordance with the product labe l.  Documentation of temperatur e monitoring should be 
maintained.
6.7 Instructions for Preparation of Treatments for Administrati on and 
Dispensing 
6.7.1 BGF MDI, GFF MDI, BFF MDI
Individual BGF MDI, GFF MDI, and BFF MDI will be packaged in a foil pouch and 
contained in an individual vis it treatment box.  Both the visit  treatment box and the foil 
overwrap will have a label with a  component ID number.  Confirm  that the identifier given 
by IWRS and the component ID  number written on the label are th e same.  The visit 
treatment box is labe led with a 2-part lab el.  Write the subjec t number and treatment visit 
number on each of the 2-part label s.  The ‘tear-off’ part of th e label is to be placed onto the 
IWRS confirmation report. 
All MDIs must be primed before t he first use.  Priming involves  releasing a certain number 
of sprays (4) into the air befor e the first use of the inhaler.   Shaking and priming the inhaler 
fills a chamber inside the canister with the correct dose and m ix of medication so that the 
inhaler is ready to use.
The MDI must be primed in a separ ate room, away from the subjec t treatment area.  
Each dose will consist of 2 puffs from the MDI.  Subjects will be dispensed the MDI and 
instructed to continue taking study medication twice daily, 2 p uffs in the morning and 2 puffs 
in the evening appr oximately 12 hours apart, until subject retu rns to the clinic.  The MDI 
should be stored at room tempera ture by the subject, to avoid t emperature extremes, and the 
products should not be stored in di rect sunlight.  Refer to Appendix 2 for instructions on 
administration and cleaning of BGF MDI, GFF MDI, and BFF MDI.   
6.7.2 Ventolin HFA®  
Refer to  Appendix 3 for the manufacturer’s instru ctions on the administration and c leaning of

6.8 Drug Accountability/Return of Clinical Supplies 
Under no circumstances will the Investigator(s) allow the study  drug to be used other than as 
directed by this protocol. 
Investigational clinical supplies must be received by a designa ted person at the study site, 
handled and stored safely and pr operly, and kept in a secure lo cation to which only the 
Investigator and designated assist ants have access.  Storage co nditions for the clinical 
supplies should be observed, mon itored and documented.  Clinica l supplies are to be 
dispensed only in accordance wit h the protocol.  The Investigat or or designee is responsible 
for keeping accurate records of t he clinical supplies received from Pearl, the amount 
dispensed to and returned by the subject, and the amount remain ing at the conclusion of the 
study. Study medication should be  handled in accordance with Go od Pharmacy Practices 
(i.e., gloves should always be wor n by study personnel if direc tly handling tablets or capsules 
that are returned).  The Clini cal Monitor should be contacted w ith any questions concerning 
investigational products where special or protective handling i s indicated.  At the end of the 
study, all clinical supplies in cluding partial and empty contai ners must be returned as 
directed by Pearl.
Sites should check with the Pearl representative for appropriat e documentation that needs to 
be completed for drug accountability. 
The Investigator or designa ted assistant should not open indivi dual clinical supply containers 
until all pre-dose assessments  have been completed and the subj ect is eligible to be 
randomized/continue with the stu dy.  Any deviation from this mu st be discussed with the 
Clinical Monitor.
For each subject, all used study  drug materials will be collect ed.  Used subject supplies will 
be kept at room temperature in a  secure and locked cabinet unti l returned to Pearl or 
designee.   
Note:  Used study drug will be stored separately from unused study dr ug. 
All product complaints (including  device malfunctions) must be reported to Pearl using the 
Product Complaints Form provide d in each site’s regulatory bind er.  Pearl will contact the 
site to evaluate the nature of t he complaint and determine what  further action is needed.

7 STUDY PROCEDURES
A schedule of event s is provided in Table 8-1.    
7.1 Bone Mineral Density Assessments 
Bone mineral density will be evalu ated by taking two sets of DE XA scans (lumbar spine and 
hip regions) prior to randomiz ation (Study PT010006 Visit 4) an d Visit 14 (Week 52) in this 
study. After the first scan, of t he lumbar spine and hip region , the subject will get up from the 
table, and be repositioned, to take another set of scans at the se skeletal sites. If these first two 
scans differ by more than 5% (as  determined by the local facili ty) for either site (i.e. first two 
hip or first two lumbar sites)  a third scan should be obtained.  The screening period may be 
extended up to a maximum of 21 days i f additional time is neede d to complete the 
assessments. The results of these  scans will be provided by the central testing facility to the 
investigative site to allow appr opriate management of the subje ct. 
For any clinically relevant re duction in T-score, the investiga tor should consider appropriate 
treatment options based on local g uidelines for the subject and /or refer them to their local 
medical doctor or a specialist fo r treatment. If a subject’s T- score (hip or lumbar spine) is <-
2.5 at screening they are excluded.
Both the lumbar spine L2-L4 and total hip bone density will be measured. The scans of each 
skeletal site will be centrally  analyzed to obtain the final re sult to be used for data analysis.
For >1 scan the median will be considered for eligibility. 
Full details can be found in the BMD manual 
7.2 Ophthalmologic Assessments
The baseline ophthalmologic asse ssment must be performed prior to Randomization between 
Visits 1 and 4 (Screening) of S tudy PT010006. Two post-baseline  ophthalmologic 
assessments will be performed a t Visit 11 (Week 28), and Visit 14 (Week 52) only per 
exclusion criteri a exception noted in  Section 5.2.2.  These post-baseline ophthalmologic 
assessments should be scheduled t o occur within two weeks prior  to the scheduled clinic 
visit. Due to diurnal variab ility of IOP, all ophthalmic examin ations following the first 
ophthalmic examination (baselin e) should be scheduled to occur within two hours of the time 
of day when the baseline ophthalmic  examination was performed. The same ophthalmologist
should perform the ophthalmic examin ations for a given subject at all visits if possible, to 
ensure consistency.  
At participating centers, all subjects will be referred to a ce rtified as LOCSIII trained 
ophthalmologist/optometrist f or evaluation of  pupil dilation, l enticular opacities, fundoscopic 
examination, intraocular pressure  (IOP), manifest refraction an d visual acuity. This data will 
also be categorized as normal/abnormal. 
The Lens Opacities Classificati on System (LOCS) III grading sys tem will be used to assess 
lenticular opacities in this study. The following assessments w ill be performed using a 
Confidential and Proprietary Page 46 of 112

Clinical Trial Protocol:  PT010008-01 Version 2.0,
decimalized scale ranging from  0.1 (indicating a completely clea r or colorless lens) to either 
5.9 (indicating complete opaci fication on the cortex or posteri or capsule for C or P scales) or 
6.9 (indicating advanced opacifi cation and brunescence of the n ucleus for NO or NC scales). 
Each assessment will be recorde d to the nearest 0.1 as determin ed by the certified 
ophthalmologist/optometrist.Since the posterior subcapsula r region is thought to be the are a most characteristically 
affected by corticosteroid use, t he LOCS III (P) score is the p rimary analysis.
• Nuclear Opalescence ( NO scale 0.1 to 6.9) is the average of th e opalescence of the
two regions of the nucleus 
• Nuclear Color (NC scale 0.1 to 6.9)  is the grade of color of the posterior 
   subcapsular reflex (a proxy for nuclear color)  • Cortical Cataract (C scale  0.1 to 5.9) is the aggregate area of visible opacification (in the 
lightly and darkly shadowed) por tions of the cortical opacities
• The severity of Posterior Sub capsular Cataract (PSC) will be expressed as a P grade derived
   from the LOCS III P scale (0.1 to 5.9). With a maximally dil ated pupil the LOCS III P  
grade will be defined as the to tal area of aggregated component  PSCs related to the LOCS  
   III P standards, regardless  of where they are located on the  posterior capsule. The method  
for making this assessment will be  dealt with in the LOCS III tr aining recordings.
NOTE: The ophthalmologist/optometri st must not refer to prior L OCS III grades and 
LOGMAR visual acuities from prev ious ophthalmic examination at the time of a new 
examination
Fundoscopic examination will in clude the evaluation of horizont al cup-to-disc ratio for each 
eye.
Intraocular Pressure: Intraocular pressure (IOP) will be measur ed using Goldman 
Applanation Tonometry. Three meas ures of IOP will be completed for each eye during each 
ophthalmic examination and all three measures will be recorded.  The lowest reading will be 
considered to evaluate eligibility criteria
Visual acuity and manifest refraction: 
Visual acuity (best-corrected di stance vision) and manifest ref raction (sphere, cylinder and 
axis) will be assessed during e ach ophthalmic examination. LogM AR (Logarithm of the 
Minimum Angle of Resolution) visual acuity using Early Treatmen t Diabetic Retinopathy 
Study (ETDRS) charts will be utilized. Both the visual acuity a nd manifest refraction values 
will be captured in the source document. 
7.3 Subject Electronic Diary (eDiary) Data Collection
Subjects will continue to use thei r electronic subject diary (e Diary) provided during 
participation in Study PT010006 t o continue to record time of s tudy medication 
administration, use of rescue albuterol (Ventolin HFA), and dos e indicator reading (if 
assigned to BGF MDI, GFF MDI or BFF MDI only). 
Confidential and Proprietary Page 47 of 112
Budesonide, Glycopyrronium, and Formoterol Fumarate Inhalation Aerosol Pearl Therapeutics, Inc.
Clinical Trial Protocol:  PT010008-01 Version 2.0,
Electronic Diary Compliance Requirement :  Subject participati on may be terminated at 
any time during the study for the following reasons:
•Chronic failure, in the judgment  of the Investigator, to comply  with diary compliance, 
despite documentation at the site  of repeated efforts to reinfo rce compliance.  As defined 
for this study, compliance requi res >70% subject completion of diary assessments.  Pearl 
may also instruct a site t o discontinue a subject based on cons istent noncompliance   
In-clinic dosing times and dose i ndicator readings will be docu mented by the site staff and 
will not be entered by the subject into their eDiary.
The eDiary data report will be  available to site personnel thro ugh the vendor's server. The 
eDiary data report should be rev iewed by the study personnel at  each visit. The review 
should verify that morning and evening diary entries have been recorded by the subject for 
compliance requirements.  The  subject should be reinstructed, a s appropriate, on the 
importance of recording twice dail y entries if missing entries are observed.
7.3.1 Rescue Medication Usage
The subject will record the total  number of “puffs” of rescue m edication (i.e., albuterol 
sulfate or locally available equivalent produ ct) used on a dail y basis in the eDiary.  The 
number of “puffs” of rescue pr oduct will be recorded as the num ber of actuations on the 
canister.  For example, when r escue product is required and 2 a ctuations are inhaled, this 
should be recorded as 2 “puffs.”  In the event the subject requ ires 4 actuations, this should be 
recorded as 4 “puffs”.  Subject s requiring more than 8 puffs pe r day on 3 consecutive days 
with worsening symptom s should contact the site.   
7.3.2 Medication Compliance 
Time of dosing with study medic ation will be recorded in the su bject’s eDiary for each day 
of treatment (except the in-c linic dosing time).  Study medicat ion compliance will be 
checked at all visits, and any i ssues identified will be docume nted in the appropriate study 
files.
7.3.3 Recording of Dose Indicator Reading
The BGF MDI, GFF MDI and BFF MDI will be fitted with a dose indi cator to track in life 
use of the MDI.
Subjects will be instructed to r ecord the dose indicator readin g from the MDI in their 
eDiary.
Prior to dosing at Visit 11 t o Visit 14, site personnel will ob serve the dose indicator reading 
on the study drug returned by the subject and record the dose i ndicator reading in the source.

Clinical Trial Protocol:  PT010008-01 Version 2.0,
Note: The dose indicator reading recorded by the site staff will be d ose indicator reading 
observed prior to subject dosing.  For new MDIs the recorded co unt will be the count
following the priming of the MDI but before the subject dose. 
At each visit, the site staff will compare the dose indicator r eading from the prior evening 
entered in the subject eDiary w ith the dose indicator reading r ecorded by the site staff.  For 
major discrepancies (i.e., >20 pu ff difference) the site staff w ill review the major discrepancy 
with the subject and document reas on for the major discrepancy.   If appropriate, site staff 
will retrain the subject on the proper recording of dose indica tor reading and/or proper use of 
the MDI.
7.3.4 Major/minor Symptom Worsening Assessment and Alert System
All major and minor symptoms of  a worsening event will be captu red at once each morning 
for the purposes of a symptom worsening alert. The purpose of t his alert is to notify both the 
subject and the site of a potential symptom worsening event tha t warrants contact between 
the subject and site for  further evaluation. 
All questions will ha ve a 24-hour recall pe riod.  Questions per taining to the severity of 
symptoms versus their usual st ate will have 3 response options (e.g., How breathless have 
you been in the last 24 hours? Les s breathlessness than usual, Usual level of breathlessness, 
More breathless than usual) whe reas questions related to the pr esence or absence of a
symptom will have a dichotomous  response (e.g., Have you had a sore throat in the last 24 
hours? No, Yes, I had a sore throat). 
An alert will be triggered if 2 or  more major symptoms (dyspnea , sputum volume, and 
sputum color) worsen for 2 consecu tive days or if 1 major sympt om and 1 minor symptom 
(sore throat, cold, fever wit hout other cause, cough, and wheez e) worsen for at least 
2 consecutive days. When either of these criteria is met, the su bject will be ale rted via the 
eDiary to contact the site as s oon as possible for further eval uation. Likewise, the study site 
will be alerted to contact the subject within approximately 24 to 72 hours if he/she has not 
yet contacted the study sit e for further evaluation.
7.3.5: EXACT
The exacerbations of chronic pulm onary disease tool (EXACT) que stionnaire will be 
captured via the subject eDiary (see Appendix 4)
7.4 COPD Exacerbations 
A COPD exacerbation will be defined a s a change in the subject’s  usual COPD symptoms 
that lasts 2 or more days, is beyond normal day-to-day variatio n, is acute in onset, and may 
warrant a change in regular med ication.  The change in symptoms  must include at least one 
major COPD symptom and at least  one other major or minor sympto m from the list below:
xMajor COPD symptoms: dyspnea , sputum volume, and sputum color  
Confidential and Proprietary Page 49 of 112
Budesonide, Glycopyrronium, and Formoterol Fumarate Inhalation Aerosol Pearl Therapeutics, Inc.
Clinical Trial Protocol:  PT010008-01 Version 2.0,
xMinor COPD symptoms: cough, wheez e, sore throat, cold symptoms (rhinorrhea or nasal 
congestion), and fever w ithout other cause   
If symptoms are acute or have progressed rapidly and require tr eatment less than two days 
from onset of symptoms, the inve stigator will have to justify t he decision for defining the 
event as an exacerbation and record it in the eCRF. 
If a subject’s symptoms and the  overall clinical findings suppo rt the diagnosis of a COPD 
exacerbation, but the subject has not  experienced a worsening o f at least one major COPD 
symptom and at least one other major or minor symptom, the inve stigator will have to justify 
the decision for defining the e vent as an exacerbation and reco rd it in the eCRF. 
7.4.1 Severity of COPD Exacerbation
COPD exacerbations will  be classified as mild, moderate or seve re based on the following 
criteria:
Exacerbations will be considered m oderate if they result in: 
xUse of systemic corticosteroids and/or antibiotics for at least  3 days; a single depot 
injectable dose of corticosteroid s will be consid ered equivalen t to a 3-day course of 
systemic corticosteroids
Exacerbations will be considere d severe if they result in: 
xAn inpatient COPD-related hosp italization (docum entation statin g that the subject was 
KRVSLWDOL]HGIRUWKH&23'H[DFHU EDWLRQRUDUHFRUGRIWKHVXEMH FWEHLQJDGPLWWHGIRU
hours to  an observation area, the  emergency department, or oth er equivalent healthcare 
facility depending on the count ry and healthcare system) 
xCOPD-related death
Exacerbations will be considered mild if they do not meet the r equirements to be  classified as 
moderate or severe but otherwis e fulfill the definition of COPD  exacerbation.  
7.4.2 Duration of COPD exacerbation
For moderate or severe exacerba tions, the duration is defined b y the length of prescribed 
treatment, whereas for mild ex acerbations, the duration is defi ned by the length of symptoms. 
For moderate or severe COPD e xacerbations, the  start date will be defined as the start date of 
prescribed treatment with a systemic corticosteroid or systemic  antibiotic and the stop date 
will be defined as the last day of  prescribed treatment with a systemic corticosteroid or 
systemic antibiotic.  In order t o ensure that the same event is  not counted twice, concurrent 
moderate or severe COPD exacer bations with sta rt and stop dates  equal to or less than 7 days 
apart will be considered the sam e event and assigned the maximu m severity between the 
two.
Confidential and Proprietary Page 50 of 112
Budesonide, Glycopyrronium, and Formoterol Fumarate Inhalation Aerosol Pearl Therapeutics, Inc.
Clinical Trial Protocol:  PT010008-01 Version 2.0,
For mild COPD exacerbations, sta rt date will be de fined as the onset of worsened symptoms 
as recorded by the subject in t he eDiary, and the stop date wil l be defined as the last day of 
worsened symptoms.  In order to e nsure that the same event is n ot counted twice, mild COPD 
exacerbations with start and stop da tes equal to or less than 7  days apart will be considered 
the same event.   
7.4.3 Approach for Capturing COPD Exacerbations
All moderate or severe COPD ex acerbations must be captured usin g the COPD Exacerbation 
eCRF.  Mild COPD exacerbations w ill be captured based on sympto ms as recorded by the 
subject in the eDiary.  COPD ex acerbations of any severity will  be considered expected study 
endpoints and will not be  reported as adverse events (AEs) unle ss considered a serious AE 
(SAE).
7.4.4 Other Information
Pearl Therapeutics will be using an electronic diary (eDiary) t o capture daily symptom 
reporting.  If symptoms meet a s pecific threshold (i.e., one ma jor COPD symptom and at 
least one other major or minor s ymptom for 2 consecutive days),  the eDiary generates alerts 
to the subject and the clinical s ite.  This alert is intended t o generate a contact between the 
subject and the clinical investig ator.  The clinical investigat or makes the decision to escalate 
or initiate treatment  (steroids and/or an tibiotics and/or hospi talizations).
Circumstances will occur where symptoms are not captured in the  eDiary (e.g., technical 
difficulties, rapid deteriora tion, or sudden death).  In these cases, the investig ator or designee 
will enter the information into the eCRF to capture the symptom s related to a COPD 
exacerbation.
7.4.5 Investigator-Judged COPD Exacerbations
For events which do not meet the ou tlined symptom criteria and/ or when symptoms have a 
shorter duration, the investigat or can justify the decision for  considering the event an 
exacerbation.  Exacerbations could be  defined by an investigato r when symptoms of COPD 
warranted urgent treatment due t o rapid onset or rapidly progre ssive symptoms.  Such a 
situation does not allow en RXJKWLPHWRVWULFWO\IXOILOOWKH FULWHULDIRUV\PSWRPGXUDWLRQ 
consecutive days).  In these cases, the investigator may define  such an event as a COPD 
exacerbation.  As clinical presen tations may vary among patient s with COPD, exacerbations 
defined by an investigator can be  supported by respiratory symp toms that may not strictly 
fulfill all symptom requirement s defined above.  Since the inve stigator will need to document 
the symptoms that justify his  or her decision to begin treatmen t defining a COPD 
exacerbation event, all exacerbati ons in the study will have do cumented symptoms justifying 
their clinical relevance.

7.7 Adverse Events
7.7.1 Performing Adverse Events Assessments
The Investigator is responsible  for promptly documenting and re porting all AEs observed 
during the study in the subject ’s case report form and on the A E Reporting Form. If the AE is 
“alarming,” the Investigator must report the AE immediately to Pearl.  In addition, certain 
AEs (as described in  Section 7.4.9)  are classified as "serious" and must be reported no later 
than 24 hours after the Investigat or recognizes/classifies the event as an SAE to Pearl or its 
designee.
In the case of SAEs, after disc ussing the details of the AE, th e Investigator and the Medical 
Monitor may discontinue the subject prematurely. 
7.7.2 Adverse Event Definitions
The following definitions of terms  are guided by the Internatio nal Conference on 
Harmonisation of Technical Require ments for Registration of Pha rmaceuticals for Human 
Use (ICH), the US Code of Fed eral Regulations (21 CFR 312.32) a nd EU Directive 
2001/83/EC and are i ncluded herein. 
An AE is any untoward medical o ccurrence associated with the us e of a drug in humans, 
whether or not considered drug r elated.  An AE (also referred t o as an adverse experience) 
can be any unfavorable and uninte nded sign (e.g., an abnormal l aboratory finding), symptom, 
or disease temporally associate d with the use of a drug, withou t any judgment about 
causality.  An AE can arise from any use of the drug (e.g., off -label use, use in combination 
with another drug) and from any route of adminis tration, formul ation, or dose, including an 
overdose. 
Adverse events include , but are not limited to: 
• Any symptom or condition not previously reported by the subjec t (medical history) 
• An exacerbation of a pre-existing symptom or condition• A significant increase in fre quency or intensity of a pre-exi sting episodic event or 
condition 
• A drug interaction• A condition first detected or di agnosed after study drug admi nistration even though it 
may have been present prior to the start of the study 
Confidential and Proprietary Page 56 of 112
Budesonide, Glycopyrronium, and Formoterol Fumarate Inhalation Aerosol Pearl Therapeutics, Inc.
Clinical Trial Protocol:  PT010008-01 Version 2.0,
An AE does not include: 
• Medical or surgical procedures (e.g., surgery, endoscopy, too th extraction, blood 
transfusion); the condition that leads to the procedure are an AE (e.g., bleeding 
esophageal varices, dental caries)
• Overdose of either study drug or concurrent medication withou t any clinical signs or 
symptoms
• Non-clinically significant abnormal laboratory values.  (If ac companied by 
signs/symptoms, the signs or symptoms are considered an AE.) 
7.7.3 Severity
The Investigator must categoriz e the severity of each AE accord ing to the following 
guidelines: 
Mild : Associated with no limitation of us ual activities or only sli ght discomfort; generally not 
requiring alteration or  cessation of study dr ug administration;  and/or not needing therapeutic 
intervention. 
Moderate : Associated with limitation of us ual activities or significant  discomfort; generally 
requiring alteration or  cessation of study dr ug administration;  and/or requiring  therapeutic 
intervention. 
Severe : Associated with inability of subject to carry out usual activ ities or very marked 
discomfort; considered to be lif e-threatening; resulting in sig nificant disability or incapacity; 
and requiring therape utic intervention. 
7.7.4 Relationship
The relationship of each AE to the  study drug administration wi ll be assessed by the 
Investigator after careful cons ideration, and according to the following guidelines: 
Definitely : A reaction that follows a reason able temporal sequence from a dministration of 
study drug; that follows a know n or expected response pattern t o the study drug; it disappears 
or decreases on cessation or reduction in study drug dose; and/ or it reappears or worsens 
when the study drug is administered. 
Probably : A reaction that follows a reason able temporal sequence from a dministration of 
study drug; that follows a know n or expected response pattern t o the study drug; and/or that 
could not be reasonably explaine d by other factors such as unde rlying disease, complications, 
concomitant drugs, or con current treatments. 
Possibly:  A reaction that follows a reason able temporal sequence from ad ministration of 
study drug; that follows a know n or expected response pattern t o the study drug, but that 
could reasonably have been produ ced by a number of other factor s including underlying 
disease, complications, concomita nt drugs, or concurrent treatm ents.

Budesonide, Glycopyrronium, and Formoterol Fumarate Inhalation Aerosol Pearl Therapeutics, Inc.
Clinical Trial Protocol:  PT010008-01 Version 2.0,
Not Related : A reaction for which sufficien t data exist to indicate that t he etiology is 
unrelated to the study drug. 
7.7.5 Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Exacerbations
All moderate or severe COPD ex acerbations must be captured usin g the COPD Exacerbation 
eCRF.  Mild COPD exacerbations w ill be captured based on sympto ms as recorded by the 
subject in the eDiary.  COPD ex acerbations of any severity will  be considered expected study 
endpoints and will not be  reported as adverse events (AEs) unle ss considered a serious AE 
(SAE). 
Exacerbation(s) of COPD is exp ected to occur as a progression o f disease despite 
standardized drug tre atment, or treatment(s ) with combination t herapies. As a result, the 
Sponsor has classified this even t as a protocol specified crite ria expected event. Any 
individual case safety reports received related to exacerbation  of COPD will not be submitted 
on an expedited basis as a Suspect ed Unexpected Serious Adverse  Reaction (SUSAR) unless 
otherwise required as per the Sponsor’s medical assessment.
7.7.6 Adverse Events of Special Interest
Certain AEs have been identified a s adverse events of special in terest (AESIs) due to the 
class of drugs being studied.  A dditional adverse events of spe cial interest , including 
increased IOP, glaucoma, other oc ular AE’s and fractures will b e defined in the SAP. Some 
events are described below but thi s is not a comprehensive list  of all AESIs.
7.7.6.1 LABA and LAMA Effects
Known effects of LAMAs and LABAs include cardiovascular effects , ocular disorders, 
urinary retention, gastrointes tinal disorders, and anticholiner gic effects for LAMAs and 
cardiovascular and tremor effects for LABAs. 
7.7.6.2 Local Steroid Effects 
Local steroid effects include or al candidiasis, hoarseness cand idiasis, oropharyngeal 
candidiasis, dysphonia, and throat irritation.  
7.7.6.3 Pneumonia
In order to adequately assess a nd characterize the risk of pneu monia in patients in a non-
biased manner, an external, i ndependent pneumon ia adjudication committee (PAC) will 
review all adverse events repor ted as pneumonia to ensure appro priate pre-defined and 
clinically consistent pne umonia criteria are met.
To standardize the diagnosis of  pneumonia a clinically consiste nt definition of pneumonia 
will be implemente d, which will require the following: 
1. Clinical diagnosis of pneum onia by the investigator 
Confidential and Proprietary Page 58 of 112
Budesonide, Glycopyrronium, and Formoterol Fumarate Inhalation Aerosol Pearl Therapeutics, Inc.
Clinical Trial Protocol:  PT010008-01 Version 2.0,
2. Documentation of chest imagi ng obtained within 14 days of the  diagnosis of pneumonia 
that is compatible wit h the diagnosis of pneumonia 
3. Treatment with antibiotics (and/ or if appropriate antiviral a nd/or antifungal agents)
4. At least 2 of the following clin ical signs, symptoms, or labo ratory findings: 
•Increased cough  
•Increased sputum purulence or production  
•Adventitious breath sounds on auscultation  
•Dyspnea or tachypnea 
•Fever
•Elevated white blood cell counts 
•Hypoxemia 
The PAC will be empowered to re quest any additional information , including copies of chest 
X-rays or CT scans if needed, to c onfirm the pneumonia diagnosi s.   
Radiographs will be evaluated lo cally and the results (infiltra te compatible with pneumonia 
(yes/no) will be entered in the  eCRF.  If the investigator beco mes aware that a diagnosis of 
pneumonia was made without a che st image having been performed,  he or she should obtain 
a chest image (frontal and l ateral) up to 10 to 14 days after t he date of pneumonia diagnosis.  
7.7.6.4 Paradoxical Bronchospasm
Monitoring for paradoxical br onchospasm will occur through spon taneous reporting. 
7.7.7 Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events (MACE)
Due to the prevalence of cardi ovascular diseases in patients wi th COPD, MACE will be 
evaluated according to pre-defined criteria as described in the  Charters.  CCV and Mortality 
Adjudication Committees will review  and adjudicate serious CCV events as MACE and are 
defined as the following: 
xCardiovascular death
xNon-fatal myocardial infarction (MI)
xNon-fatal stroke
Charters will be established to g overn these processes prior to  the First Patient First Visit.  
7.7.8 Clinical Laboratory Adverse Events
Many laboratory abnormalities obs erved during the course of a s tudy will be included under 
a reported AE describing a clini cal syndrome (e.g., elevated BU N and creatinine in the 
setting of an AE of renal failu re, or decreased hemoglobin in a  case of bleeding esophageal 
varices).  Isolated laborator y abnormalities s hould be reported  as AEs if they are considered 
to be clinically significant by the Investigator.
Confidential and Proprietary Page 59 of 112 
Budesonide, Glycopyrronium, and Formoterol Fumarate Inhalation Aerosol Pearl Therapeutics, Inc.
Clinical Trial Protocol:  PT010008-01 Version 2.0,
Criteria for a "clinically significant" laboratory abnormality are:
• A laboratory abnormality th at leads to a dose-limiting toxici ty (e.g., an abnormality that 
results in study drug dose reduc tion, suspension, or discontinu ation) 
• A laboratory abnormality that r esults in any therapeutic inter vention (i.e., concomitant 
medication or therapy)
• Other laboratory abnormality ju dged by the Investigator to be of any particular clinical 
concern (e.g., significant fa ll in hemoglobin not requiring tra nsfusion) 
For laboratory abnormalities that do not meet the above criteri a but are outside of normal 
range (e.g., < or > normal refere nce range), the Investigator s hould indicate whether the 
value is clinically significant  or not clinically significant f or the subject.
7.7.9 Serious Adverse Events
An AE is considered “serious” if, in the view of the Investigat or or Sponsor, it results in any 
of the following outcomes: 
•Death
•A life-threatening AE
•In patient hospitalization or pr olongation of existing hospital ization  
•A persistent or significant in capacity or substantial disruptio n of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions 
•A congenital anomaly/birth defect
Important medical events that m ay not result in death, be life threatening, or require 
hospitalization may be consider ed serious when, based upon appr opriate judgment, they may 
jeopardize the subject or subject  and may require medical or su rgical intervention to prevent 
one of the outcomes listed in the  definition.  Examples of such  medical events include 
allergic bronchospasm  requiring intensive  treatment in an emerg ency room or at home, blood 
dyscrasias or convulsions that  do not result in subject hospita lization, or the de velopment of 
drug dependency or drug abuse. 
Hospitalization for a pre-existin g condition, including electiv e procedures, which has not 
worsened, does not constitute an SAE. 
An AE or suspected adverse reac tion is considered “life-threate ning’ if, in the view of the 
Investigator or Sponsor, its occu rrence places the subject or s ubject at immediate risk of 
death.  It does not include an adv erse reaction or suspected ad verse reaction that, had it 
occurred in a more severe for m, might have caused death. 
An AE or suspected adverse reac tion is considered unexpected if  it is not listed in the current 
Investigator brochure or is not listed at the specificity or se verity that has been observed.

7.7.9.1 Reporting of Serious Adverse Events
In agreeing to the provisions of t his protocol, the Investigato r accepts all legal responsibilities 
for AE identification, documenta tion, grading, assignment of ca usality, and prompt 
notification of SAEs to Pearl Ph armacovigilance or designee.  A ll SAEs must be reported to 
Pearl Therapeutics no later tha n 24 hours after the Investigato r recognizes/classifies the event 
as an SAE.  At a minimum, a descri ption of the event and the In vestigator’s judgment of 
causality must be provided at the time of the initial report us ing the appropriate form (e.g., 
SAE Report Form).  After the in itial report, as necessary, the Investigator must provide any 
additional information on a SAE t o Pearl Pharmacovigilance with in 2 working days after 
he/she receives that informa tion.  This follow-up information w ill be a detailed written report 
that may include copies of hosp ital records, case reports, and autopsy reports, and other 
pertinent documents. 
Post-study SAEs following the last dose of study drug must be r eported to Pearl as described 
inSection 7.4.9.4.
The Investigator is responsible  for continuing to report any ne w or relevant follow-up 
information that he/she  learns about the SAE. 
7.7.9.2 Supplemental Investigations of SAEs
The Investigator and supporting pe rsonnel responsible for subje ct care should discuss with 
the Medical Monitor any need for  supplemental investigations of  SAEs.  The results of these 
additional assessmen ts conducted must be r eported to Pearl.  If  a subject dies during 
participation in the study and a  post-mortem examination is per formed, a copy of the autopsy 
report must be submitted to Pearl.
7.7.9.3 Post-Study Follow-Up of Adverse Events
Any AEs that are unresolved at th e subject’s last AE assessment  in the study are followed up 
by the Investigator for as long  as medically indicated, but wit hout further recording in the 
eCRF.  Pearl retains the right t o request additional informatio n for any subject with ongoing 
AE(s)/SAE(s) at the end of the  study, if judged necessary. 
7.7.9.4 Notification of Post-Study Serious Adverse Events
Investigators are not obligated t o actively follow subjects aft er the completion of the study.  
However, if the Investigator beco mes aware of a post-study SAEs  occurring up to 14 days 
following the last dose of study  drug must be reported to Pearl , whether or not  the event is 
attributable to study drug.  All SAEs must be reported to Pearl  no later than 24 hours after the 
Investigator recognizes/clas sifies the event as an SAE.
7.7.9.5 Investigational Research Board/Independent Ethics Commit tee Notification of 
Serious Adverse Events
The Investigator is responsible  for promptly notifying her/his Investigational Research 
Board/Independent Ethics Committee (IRB/IEC) of all SAEs, inclu ding any follow-up

information, occurring at her/his site and any SAE regulatory r eport, including any follow-up 
reports that he/she receives fro m Pearl.  Documentation of the submission to the IRB/IEC 
must be retained for each safety  report.  The Investigator is a lso responsible for notifying 
Pearl if their IRB/IEC require s revisions to the ICF or other m easures based on its review of 
an SAE report. 
7.7.9.6 Health Authority Safety Reports
Pearl or its representatives will submit a safety report to the  Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA) and/or any other appropria te regulatory agencies, for any  suspected adverse reaction 
that is both serious and unexpecte d within the app ropriate time  frame. 
Pearl or its representatives  will send copies of each safety re port submitted to the FDA and/or 
other regulatory agencies to the Investigators who are actively  participating in Pearl-
sponsored clinical studies.  Saf ety reports must be submitted t o the appropriate  IRB/IEC as 
soon as possible.  Documentati on of the submission to the IRB/I EC must be retained for each 
safety report.
7.7.10 Overdose
An overdose is defined as a dose greater than the high dose lev el evaluated in this study as 
described in Section 6.2 (Product Descriptions) that res ults in clinical signs and sympt oms.  
In the event of an overdose of s tudy medication, the Investigat or should use clinical 
judgment in treating the overdos e and contact the study Medical  Monitor. The Investigator 
should refer to the relevant docum ent(s) for det ailed informati on regarding warnings, 
precautions, contraindications, A Es, and other significant data  pertaining to the study drug(s) 
being used in this study. Such document may include, but not be  limited to, the Investigator’s 
Brochure for BGF MDI, BFF MDI, GFF MDI, and approved product labe ling for open-label 
products. 
7.7.11 Pregnancy
To ensure subject safety, each pr egnancy in a female subject fr om Visit 1 (Screening) until 
study completion must be re ported to Pearl within 24 hours of l earning of its occurrence.  
The pregnancy should be follo wed up to determine  outcome, inclu ding spontaneous or 
voluntary termination, details of  the birth, and the presence o r absence of any birth defects, 
congenital abnor malities, or maternal and/ or newborn complicati ons.  Pregnancy should be 
recorded on a Paper Pregnancy Re port Form and reported by the I nvestigator to Pearl 
Pharmacovigilance or designee .  Pregnancy follow-up should be r ecorded on the same form 
and should include an a ssessment of the possible relationship t o the Pearl study drug of any 
pregnancy outcome.  Any SAE exper ienced during pregnancy must b e reported on the SAE 
Report Form. 
7.7.12 Use of Steroids during the Study
At each visit, subjects will be ask ed whether they have been ad ministered oral, intramuscular, 
or intravenous corticos teroids since last visit.  Use of oral, intramuscular, or intravenous 
corticosteroids for the management of COPD exacerbations or oth er condition is not a reason 
Confidential and Proprietary Page 62 of 112
Budesonide, Glycopyrronium, and Formoterol Fumarate Inhalation Aerosol Pearl Therapeutics, Inc.
Clinical Trial Protocol:  PT010008-01 Version 2.0,
for early termination.  Use of c orticosteroids should be docume nted.  Subjects who are being 
treated for a COPD exacerbatio n with oral corticosteroids or ha ve been treated for a COPD 
exacerbation with oral corticoste roids within 14 days of the sc heduled visit w ill be allowed to 
perform PFTs under close medi cal supervision.  The Investigator  can decide to stop PFTs if 
subject safety is at risk or sym ptoms make it difficult for the  subject to continue.
Subjects treated wit h oral, intramuscular , or intravenous corti costeroids for other indications 
will follow their visit schedule.  If a subject requires intrao cular corticosteroids, this should 
be fully documented and the Inve stigator should make a determin ation as to the suitability of 
the subject continuing in the study. 
7.7.13 Clinical Endpoint Committee 
An external clinical endpoint committee (CEC) that was initiate d in Study PT010006 will 
continue to provide s ystematic and unbiased a ssessment of pre-d efined, Investigator reported 
adverse events for Study P T010008.  The committee will consist of experts who will provide 
a centralized review functioning  independently of Pearl. Three Clinical Endpoint 
Adjudication Charters will outlin e the clinical endpoints for a djudication.

9 PLANNED STATISTICAL METHODS
9.1 Introduction 
This Study PT010008 will be conduc ted in a subset of US sites p articipating in Study 
PT010006, and will evaluate the f ollowing treatments: 
•%*)0',ȝJ%,'
•*))0',ȝJ%,'
•%))0',ȝJ%,'
Across these sites, it is pla nned that approximately 500 subjec ts randomized to double-blind 
treatment only will pr ovide approximately  425 subjects who will  complete the study. 
Subjects will receive the same tr eatment (BGF MDI, GFF MDI, or BFF MDI) they were 
randomized to in Study PT010006. S ubjects randomized to open-lab el Symbicort TBH will 
not be enrolled in this study.  
This study will evaluate the saf ety of BGF MDI, BFF MDI, and GF F MDI on bone mineral 
density (BMD) measurement and ophthalmologic assessment.  
Baseline and demographic charact eristics will be collected in S tudy PT010006 with the 
exceptions of baseline BMD and lenticular opacity and ocular pr essure measurements. 
Baseline BMD and lenticular opaci ty and ocular pressure measure ments will be performed 
prior to Visit 4 (Randomization)  of Study PT010006. A separate informed consent will be 
obtained for subjects partic ipating in Study PT010008.

9.3  Study Populations 
The following analysis populati ons are defined in this study: 
•The Safety Population  will consist of all subjects enrolled in PT010008 who receive any 
amount of study medication.  Subj ects will be analyzed accordin g to treatment received 
rather than randomized.  If a s ubject received more than 1 rand omized treatment, they 
will be analyzed and i ncluded in summaries according to the tre atment they received the 
most. Subjects receiving no study  treatment will be excluded, a s will subjects who have 
no post-dose safety assessments .  (Note that a subject who used  a study treatment, but 
took less than 1 full dose of tr eatment will qualify for this p opulation).  
Note: The statement that a subject h ad no AEs also constitutes a safe ty assessment
•The BMD Analysis Population is defined as all evaluabl e subjects in the Safety 
Population who have a baseline BM D assessment and at least 1 on -treatment BMD 
assessment. Subjects will be analy zed according to actual treat ment received
•The Ophthalmologic Analysis Population is defined as all evaluable subjects in the 
Safety Population who have a base line ophthalmologic assessment  and at least 1 on-
treatment ophthalmologic assessmen t. Subjects will be analyzed according to actual 
treatment received 
•The mITT Population is defined as the subgroup of mITT subjects from Study 
PT010006, who enrolled in PT010008. S ubjects will be analyzed a ccording to the active 
treatment they were assigned to a t randomization in Study PT010 006. (Note that a subject 
who used a study treatment, but  took less than one full dose of  treatment will qualify for 
this population).  Data from both S tudy PT010006 and Study PT01 0008 will be included 
Exclusions from the ophthalmolo gic and BMD population will be d efined in the SAP. 
Analyses will be performed as follows:
Demographics will be summarized f or the Safety Population. Demo graphics will also be 
summarized for the BMD and Ophtha lmologic Analysis populations if these are different 
from the Safety Population. Ana lyses of ophthalmologic endpoint s will be performed on the 
Ophthalmologic Analysis Popul ation, and those of BMD endpoints will be performed on the 
BMD Analysis Population. All oth er safety analyses will be pres ented for the Safety 
Population. Efficacy will be pres ented for mITT population. 
9.4 Safety Analyses
Safety data will be summarize d both cumulatively over 52 weeks using data observed during 
PT010006 and this supplemental study . Analyses involving change  from baseline will use 
baseline values from Study PT010006.

9.4.1 Analysis of BMD Endpoints
9.4.1.1 Percent change from baseline in BMD of the lumbar spine measured using 
DEXA scans of L2-L4
The change from baseline in BMD  of the lumbar spine at Week 52 (and similarly at EoT) 
will be analyzed using an Analy sis of Covariance (ANCOVA) model  with treatment group 
and gender as categorical covari ates, and baseline BMD score, ag e, and age by gender 
interaction as con tinuous covariates. 
T- and Z- scores will be present ed as shifts from baseline to e ach time point; de tails will be 
provided in the SAP. 
9.4.1.2 Percent change from baseline in total hip BMD of the hip  measured using DEXA 
scans  
The change from baseline in B MD of the hip at Week 52 (and simi larly at EoT) will be 
analyzed similarly to the change from baseline in BMD of the lu mbar spine. 
9.4.2 Analysis of Ocular Endpoints  
9.4.2.1 Change from baseline in each of the LOCS III (NO, NC, C,  and P) scores 
Change from baseline in the LOC S III (P) scores at each post-ra ndomization visit will be 
analyzed using an Analysis of C ovariance (ANCOVA). The model wi ll include treatment 
group as a fixed effect, and baselin e LOCS III (P) score, smoki ng pack years, and age as 
continuous covariates. The model will account for inter-eye cor relation by including subject 
and eye (within subject) as random effects. 
Two-sided 95% confidence interval s will be comput ed for pairwis e differences of BGF 
minus GFF and BFF minus GFF, and non-inferiority will be declar ed if the upper confidence 
bound is less than 0.5. The analysis  of the change from baselin e in LOCS III (P) scores at 
Week 52 will be the prima ry ocular analysis, with analyses at W eek 28 and EoT being 
supportive. 
The above analyses will be repea ted for the other 3 LOCS III (N O, NC, and C) scores, but 
with the corresponding baseline LOCS III scale score as a covar iate.

9.4.5 Pneumonia Events Determined by Adjudication Committee
All AEs/SAEs with preferred ter ms that could relate to pneumoni a will be adjudicated to 
provide a more complete assessm ent of all physician-reported pn eumonias. The assessment 
of pneumonia events will include  the overall rates of pneumonia . 
9.4.6 Clinical Laborat ory Measurements
Summary statistics (n, mean, med ian, standard deviation, minimu m, and maximum) for the 
baseline assessment (Day 1) and f or the pre-dose value and chan ge from baseline at pre-dose 
value of post-baseline  visits with scheduled lab assessments of  continuous laboratory 
variables, including serum potas sium and glucose will be tabula ted. 
Shift tables relative to the nor mal reference ranges will be pr oduced using the categories 
defined by the CTCAE Version 4.03 gr ades.  For these shift tabl es, for each treatment, 
the subject’s pre-dose grade will  be cross-tabulated by the sub ject’s maximum post-baseline 
grade during the treatment; also, the subject’s maximum post-ba seline grade during treatment 
will be tabulated for all ba seline grades combined.
The number and percent of subject s with potentially clinically significant (PCS) lab values 
will be summarized.  Potentially c linically significant values for serum potassium are <3.0 
mmol/L or >6.0 mmol/L, and for bl ood glucose <2.2 mmol/L or >13. 9 mmol/L.  Potentially
clinically significant values fo r labs will be defined in the SA P.  No hypothesis tests will be 
performed.
9.4.7 Vital Signs
Summary statistics (mean, media n, standard deviation and range)  for absolute values 
and change from baseline values w ill be tabulated for each treat ment and assessment time. 
For vital signs, baseline valu es will be defined as the average  of the values prior to dosing 
at the randomization visit (Visit  4).  Potentially clinically si gnificant values for vital signs 
will be defined in the SAP and the  percentage of subjects with P CS values will be 
summarized.  No hypothesis tests will be performed.

9.4.8 Electrocardiograms
Summary statistics (mean, media n, standard deviation and range)  for raw values and 
change from baseline values in h eart rate, PR interval, QRS axis,  QRS interval, QT interval 
and QTcF interval will be calcula ted, where baseline is defined  as the average of the pre-dose 
measurements taken prior to the  start of treatment at the rando mization visit (Visit 4).  
The QTcF (Fridericia Correcte d QT) is defined as (QT/[RR1/3]).Heart rate (bpm) is 
estimated as 60,000/RR.  The se assessments will be tabulated fo r each treatment and 
assessment time.  Potentia lly clinically significant values for ECG parameters will be defined 
in the SAP, and the pe rcentage and number of subjects with PCS ECG values will be 
tabulated.  No hypothesis tests will be performed.
9.4.9 Exposure
The duration of exposure to study  medication (in days), the per son-years of exposure, the 
mean number of doses, and number a nd percentage of subjects who  are compliant will be 
summarized by treatment group.  A ll exposure summaries will be generated for the safety 
population by actual treatment received.
9.5 Analyses of Efficacy Endpoints
Analyses of efficacy will be performed using the mITT Populatio n. 
9.5.1 Rescue Ventolin HFA Use
The number of puffs of rescue Vent olin HFA taken in the previou s 12 hours will be recorded 
in the subject diary in the morni ng and evening.  For every per iod of time for w hich the mean 
number of puffs of rescue will be  calculated, missing values wi ll be ignored in both the 
numerator and denominator.  As su ch, the denominat or will be ad justed based on the number 
of days (including half days) with non-missing values.
The mean change from baseline i n rescue use will be summarized by treatment group over 52 
weeks and over each post-randomiza tion 4-week interval (Interva l 1 to Interval 13).  
9.5.2 Percentage of Days with No Rescue Ventolin HFA Use over th e Treatment 
Period
As a supportive analysis, percentage of days with ‘no rescue Ve ntolin HFA use’ over 52 
weeks will be summarized usin g descriptive statistics .  A ‘day with no rescue use’ is defined 
using rescue Ventolin HFA usage da ta from days where rescue Ven tolin HFA usage data is 
non-missing as any day where the subject reported no puffs of r escue Ventolin HFA.   
9.5.3 Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Exacerbations
The rate of moderate or severe COPD exacerbations will be summa rized by treatment group.  
Chronic obstructive  pulmonary disease exacerbations will be con sidered separate events 
provided that 7 or more days are  between the recorded stop date  of the earlier event and start

Budesonide, Glycopyrronium, and Formoterol Fumarate Inhalation Aerosol Pearl Therapeutics, Inc. 
Clinical Trial Protocol:  PT010008-01 Version 2.0, 
date of the latter.  For modera te or severe COPD exacerbations,  the start date is be defined as 
the start date of prescribed tr eatment with a systemic corticos teroid or systemic  antibiotic and 
the stop date will be defi ned as the last day  of prescribed tre atment with a systemic 
corticosteroid or systemic antib iotic. The rate of COPD exacerb ations of any severity will be 
presented in a similar manner.
Duration of COPD Exacerbation 
For moderate or severe exacerba tions, the duration is defined b y the length of prescribed 
treatment, whereas for mild ex acerbations, the duration is defi ned by the length of symptoms. 
For moderate or severe COPD ex acerbations, the start date will b e defined as the start date of 
prescribed treatment with a systemic corticosteroid or systemic  antibiotic and the stop date 
will be defined as the last day of  prescribed treatment with a systemic corticosteroid or 
systemic antibiotic. In order to e nsure that the same event is not counted twice, concurrent 
moderate or severe COPD exacer bations with sta rt and stop dates  equal to or less than 7 days 
apart will be considered the sam e event and assigned the maximu m severity between the two.  
For mild COPD exacerbations, sta rt date will be de fined as the onset of worsened symptoms 
as recorded by the subject in t he eDiary, and the stop date wil l be defined as the last day of 
worsened symptoms.  In order to e nsure that the same event is n ot counted twice, mild COPD 
exacerbations with start and stop da tes equal to or less than 7  days apart will be considered 
the same event.  
In addition, in order to not double count exacerbations that ar e moderate or severe, eDiary 
data from dates within 7 days of a moderate or severe exacerbat ion will not be included as 
additional mild COPD exacerbati ons.  This implies that continui ng worsened symptoms that 
meet the definition of a mild e xacerbation would need to be pre sent at least 2 days prior to 
the 7-day period immediately preceding the start date of a mode rate or severe COPD 
exacerbation in order to be consid ered a separate event.  Simil arly, worsened symptoms 
would need to be present for at l east 2 days after the 7-day pe riod immediately following a 
moderate or severe COPD exacerba tion to be considered a separat e event.  
9.5.4 Exacerbations of Chronic Pulmonary Disease Tool (EXACT)
The EXACT is a 14-item PRO daily  diary which will be used to me asure the effect of 
treatment on exacerbations, and on the  severity of respiratory symptoms.  The E-RS is an 
11-item subset which will be use d to measure the effect of trea tment on the severity of 
respiratory symptoms.  Mean chang e from baseline in: the daily EXACT Total Score, the 
daily total symptom score (RS-Total Score), as well as 3 subscal e scores, RS-Breathlessness, 
RS-Cough and Sputum, and RS-Chest Symptoms, will be calculated over each 4-week 
interval of the 52-week Treatme nt Period.  The last 7 days of t he Screening Period from lead-
in Study PT010006 will be used to cal culate the baseline.  The mean change from baseline 
in RS-Total Score, RS- Breathlessness, RS- Cough and Sputum, and R S-Chest Symptoms will 
be summarized by treatment g roup over 52 weeks and over each po st-randomization 4-week 
interval (Interval 1 to Interval 13).

10.12 Publication Policy 
Pearl intends to publish the resu lts of all of the clinical stu dies that it sponsors in compliance 
with the Declaration of Helsi nki (http://www.wma.net/en/10home/ index.html).  Consistent 
with the recommendations  of the editors of several leading medi cal journals, the International 
Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE), authorship of pub lications resulting from 
Pearl -sponsored studies should f airly recognize the activities  of those that have made a 
significant contribution to the study.  Thus, it is anticipated  that authorship will reflect the 
contribution made by Pearl pers onnel, the Investigators and oth ers involved, such as 
statisticians.
In recent years, issues about conflicts of interest and accurac y of the study data have been 
raised in the medical press.  Acco rdingly, Pearl has developed publication guidelines as 
described below:
1.Responsibility: Each Principal Investigator is re sponsible for the accuracy and  
completeness of all da ta from their site.  Pearl (or its repres entatives) is responsible for 
the accuracy of the data entere d into the study databases and f or the accuracy of the 
analyses conducted.
2.Sponsor Review of Ext ernal Manuscripts: Consistent with the previous bullet point, 
drafts of any and all publications  or presentations that may ar ise from this study must be 
submitted at least 30 days prior to submission for publication or presentation to Pearl for 
Confidential and Proprietary Page 87 of 112

Clinical Trial Protocol:  PT010008-01 Version 2.0, 
review, approval, and to ensure c onsistency with the policy in this protocol.  Pearl will 
have the right to request appr opriate modification to correct f acts and to represent its 
opinions, or the opinions of the  publication committee, if thes e differ with the proposed 
publication. 
3.Confidentiality: Investigators will conduct all in teractions with Pearl and with  third 
parties consistent with the executed confidentiality agreements .  While publication, by 
intention, presents the critical  scientific data  in a public fo rum, some information (such as 
future plans, results of nonclini cal studies, or chemical formu lae) may still need to remain 
confidential. 
4.Medical Journal Review: Consistent with the intenti on of Pearl to publish the study in a 
fair and accurate manner, Pear l supports diligence in the publi cation review process of 
medical journals.  Accordingly , upon request, all pertinent stu dy data and information 
will be made available as supplem ental information for journal editors and reviewers to 
evaluate and audit, e.g., protoco l and amendments, data tabulat ions.  The journal and 
reviewers will need to make arra ngements to maintain the confid entiality of such 
supplemental information, where  relevant, and Pearl will make s uitable arrangements to 
ensure that the identity of jour nal reviewers is kept confident ial.  Records will be 
maintained of reviewers and the  respective doc uments and datase ts that were reviewed by 
each of them.
5.Reporting of Clinical Trial Results:   To provide transparenc y in the conduct and 
reporting of randomized clinical t rials, Pearl reports clinical  findings based on the 
guidance of The CONSORT (Consolid ated Standards of Reporting Tr ials) Statement 
(CONSORT, 2010 ) and a 25-item checklist which is  intended to improve the repo rting of 
a randomized controlled Study,  and to facilitate r eader underst anding of the Study design, 
conduct, analysis and interpr etation, and to support their abil ity to assess the validity of 
its results.
6.Internet Clinical  Trial Listing: In addition, also consistent  with the recommendations of 
the ICMJE, Pearl will make availa ble appropriate  information re garding the study via the 
internet.  This will include reg istration and listing of the st udy on www.clinicaltrials.gov,
the US National Institutes of Health listing of clinical trials , and other clinical trial 
listings as appropriate (e.g., E UdraCT; https://eudract.ema.eur opa.eu).  Per AstraZeneca 
policy, Pearl posts clinical study  protocols for public viewing  when a manuscript is 
published in a medical journal .  Prior to being made public, th e protocol is reviewed by 
AstraZeneca Intellectual Property.

Study Design:  
Study 18F-AV-1451-A14 is designed to expand the database of 18F-AV-1451 safety and tau  binding 
as measured by PET imaging, and to provide standardized conditions for tau  use, data collection 
and analysis to facilitate companion studies including, but not limited to, longitudinal studies of 
aging, depression, and tr aumatic brain injury .  Approximately 250 subjects will be studied under 
this protocol. 
Assessments and Endpoints:  
Screening :  
Screening assessments may take place over several days and will include collection of demographic information, a medical  assessme nt for eligibility,  ECG,  a brief cognitive assessment  (e.g. MMSE ), 
and a traumatic brain injury questionnaire.  
18F-AV-1451 PET Imaging Visit:  
Subjects who qualify for the study will come to the imaging center at a later date and will have a 
catheter(s) placed for i. v. administration of 18F-AV-1451. Vital signs will be taken in a supine 
position immediately prior to administration of 18F-AV-1451 (within 30 minutes prior to injection) 
and at the completion of imaging prior to subject discharge. Subjects wi ll receive up to a target dose 
of 370 mBq as a single i.v. bolus of 18F-AV-1451.  A 20 minute  dynamic image starting  
approximately 80 minutes post injection  will be obtained. With sponsor approval s ites may elect a n 
alternative imaging protocol (i.e. diffe rent duration or start time) with additional time points .  All 
datasets will be submitted to the sponsor for analysis. 
Adverse events will be continuously monitored during the imaging session.  Subjects who 
experience any adverse event will not be discharged until the event has resolved or stabilized. 
Repeat I maging: 
Longitudinal imaging studies may be conducted under protocol 18F-AV-145 1-A14, with prior 
sponsor approval.  In these studies, subjects may have up to two imaging sessions within a 12 
month time -frame. If the second scan is obtained more than 3 months after the previous scan, then 
the MMSE should be repeated and updates to the OSU- TBI, medical history , and concomitant 
medications will be collected.  Procedures for each imaging day will be identical to those described 
above. 
Follow-Up Phone Call:   
A follow-up phone call to the subject, or designated decision maker, will be conducted between 2 or 
3 business days after imaging day, but not before 48 hours post-injection, to confirm subject well-
being and to collect information about any new adverse events.  If both of these days are not 
business days, the follow-up phone call can occur the following business day. 
Details of additional assessments that will be performed at each visit are detaile d in Section 7.1.

1. INTRODUCTION  
18F-AV-1451 (originally named [F-18]T807 by Siemens Molecular Imaging Biomarker 
Research group) has been developed as a positron emitting radiopharmaceutical for in 
vivo imaging of tau protein aggregates  (Xia et al., 2013).  Autoradiography results  using 
tissue sections from human brains showed a strong signal in the grey matter of cortical 
slices from tau positive brains but weak or no binding in tau negative, Aβ positive, or tau 
and Aβ negative tissue.   Scatchard analysis  based on this heterogeneous autoradiography 
assay  yielded an estimated K d of 15nM. A saturation binding experiment using purified 
Paired Helical Fragment -Tau isolated brains of AD patients yielded a K d value of 0.7 nM. 
AV-1451 was assessed in competitive binding assays against a panel of 72 of the most 
common central nervous system ( CNS ) targets  and no clinically relevant inhibition was 
seen.   AV-1451 was positive in the i n vitro hERG assay , albeit at a concentration more 
than 40- fold the maximum theoretical AV -1451 plasma concentration. Additionally, in 
vivo cardiovascular safety pharmacology assessments in dogs showed no evidence of QT 
prolongation at doses up to 50x the intended maximum human dose (MHD).  
Nonetheless, until sufficient human cardiovascular safety data are available, initial 
clinical studies will exclude subjects with a history of risk factors for Torsades de Pointes and subjects taking drugs known to prolong the QT interval. 
In vivo  safety pharmacology studies were also conducted in rats to determine potential 
effects on the CNS and respiratory systems. In these studies no clinically relevant effects 
were reported at doses exceeding 100x the intended MHD. Additionally, non- radioactive 
AV-1451 has been tested in single and repeat dose toxicology studies in rat and dog species.  In each of these studies the no observable adverse effect levels (NOAELs) were the highest doses tested (150x MHD for single, 50x MHD for repeat).   
Potential genotoxicity of non- radioactive AV -1451 was tested  in both in vitro and in vivo  
assays.  In the in vitro  assays, AV -1451 tested positive for potential genotoxicity.   
However, in the in vivo  rat micronucleus assay at doses up to 750x MHD (scaled 
allometrically), AV -1451 showed no evidence of genotoxicity. The different results in the 
in vitro  genotoxicity assays and the in vivo  micronucleus study are likely related to 
differences in the exposure conditions encountered by the target cells in the different test 
systems. In vivo , AV-1451 is cleared rapidly; however, the in vitro  experiments employ 
static, prolonged exposure of cells to high concentrations of the test article. While the in 
vitro  data show the potential for genotoxicity, the in vivo  data provide assurance that 
genotoxicity is unlikely to occur a t clinically -relevant doses for human diagnostic studies. 
Human dosimetry has been obtained in nine subjects.  Generally, the radiotracer distribution was consistent among the subjects and showed rapid hepatobiliary clearance.  
There were three organs that  received estimated doses higher than 0.05 mSv/MBq. The 
organ that received the largest estimated dose was the upper large intestinal wall 
(0.0962 ± 0.0134 mSv/MBq), followed by the small intestine and the liver.  The Effective 
Dose was 0. 0241 ± 0.0016 mSv/MBq. This results in an estimated Effective Dose of 
8.92 mSv for an anticipated 370 MBq (10 mCi) injection and is comparable to the effective dose of approved 
18F-labeled compounds such as fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) 
and florbetapir F 18 injection.

18F-AV-1451 may be useful as a marker of tau pathology in patients with AD and other 
neurodegenerative disorders (Figures 1 and 2).  Several preliminary studies using 18F-
AV-1451 have been completed (e.g., Chien et al., 2013).  
 The present study is designed to expand the database of 18F-AV-1451 safety and tau 
binding as measured by PET imaging, and to provide standardized conditions for tau  use, 
data collection , and analysis to facilitate companion studies including, but not limited to, 
longitudinal studies of aging, depression, and traumatic brain injury.

5. INVESTIGATIONAL PLA N 
5.1. Overall Design and Plan  of Trial  
Proto col 18F-AV-1451-A14 is designed to  expand the database of 18F-AV-1451 safety 
and tau  binding as measured by PET imaging , and to provide standardized conditions for 
18F-AV-1451 use, data collection and analysis to facilitate companion studies looking at 
tauopathies. Approximately 250 subjects will be studied under this protocol.   
Screening assessments may take place over several days and will include the collection of 
demographic information, a medical assessment for eligibility , ECG,  a brief  cognitive 
interview, including an MMSE , and a brain injury questionnaire.   
Subjects who qualify for the study will come to the imaging center  at a later date and will 
have catheter (s) placed for i.v. administration of 18F-AV-1451. Vital signs will be tak en 
in a supine position immediately prior to administration of 18F-AV-1451 (within 30 
minutes prior to injection)  and at the completion of imaging prior to discharge . Subjects 
will receive a single i.v. bolus of 18F-AV-1451, a 20 minute dynamic scan will b e 
obtained starting approximately 80 min utes post injection . With sponsor approval sites 
may elect an alternative imaging protocol with additional time points.  All datasets will be 
submitted to the sponsor for analysis.  
Adverse events will be continuously monitored during the imaging session.  Subjects 
who experience any adverse event will not be discharged until the event has resolved or stabilized.  
A follow-up phone call to the subject, or designated decision maker, will be conducted between 2 or 3 business days after imaging day, but not before 48 hours post-injection, to 
confirm subject well-being and to collect information about any new adverse events.  If 
both of these days are not business days, the follow-up phone call can occur the following 
business day.  
Longitudinal imaging studies may be conducted under protocol 
18F-AV-1451-A14, with 
prior sponsor approval.  In these studies subjects may have up to two imaging sessions 
within a 12 month time -frame. If the seco nd scan is obtained more than 3 months after 
the previous scan then the MMSE should be repeated and updates to the OSU- TBI, 
medical history, and concomitant medications will be collected . Procedures for each 
imaging day will be identical to those described above.   Adverse events will not be 
collected during the time between the first follow -up phone call and the second imaging 
session , but will be added to the medical history if clinically relevant. 
5.1.1. Dosage and Administration  
 
05Sep2014 Amendment 1 Page 14 of 33  
 

All subjects will receive a single IV bolus administration  of up to a target dose of 370 
MBq (10 mCi) of 18F-AV-1451 Injection. Where necessary to minimize trial- wise 
radiation exposure or to comply with local regulations, lower dose may be planned with 
sponsor approval. 
5.1.2. Rationale for Dosages  
18F-AV-1451 will be administered IV up to a radioactive target dose of 370 MBq with a 
maximum human mass dose (MHD) limited to 20 µg of compound by weight.  This dose 
is 150 fold lower than the NOAEL observed in the rat single dose toxicity study and is 50 fold lower than the NOAEL observed in the rat and dog repeat dose toxicity studies. 
Human dosimetry has been obtained in nine subjects. The results estimated an Effective 
Dose of 8.92 mSv for an anticipated 370 MBq (10 mCi) injection and is comparable to the effective dose of approved 
18F-labeled compounds such as FDG and florbetapir F 18 
injection.  
The proposed dose has been shown to be well tolerated and to have acceptable image quality in preliminary human studies.  
5.2.

are known to cause QT-prolongation (a list of prohibited and discouraged 
medications is provided by the Sponsor);  Patients with a prolonged QTc interval 
in the setting of intraventricular conduction block (examples RBBB or LBBB), 
may be enrolled with sponsor approval; 
3. Have a history of drug or alcohol dependence within the last year, or prior 
prolonged history of dependence unless approved by the sponsor ;  
4. Are females of childbearing potential who are not surgically sterile, not refraining 
from sexual activity or not using reliable methods of contraception. Females of 
childbearing potential must not be pregnant (negative serum or urine β- HCG at 
the time of scree ning and negative serum or urine β -HCG on imaging day ) or 
breastfeeding at screening. Females must agree to avoid becoming pregnant, and both females and males must agree to refrain from sexual activity or to use 
reliable contraceptive methods for 90 days following administration of 
18F-AV-
1451 Injection; 
5. Have a history of relevant severe drug allergy or hypersensitivity (Relevant severe drug allergies should be determined by the PI, and any questions about a subject’s eligibility can be directed to Avid. I f a subject  has a history of severe drug 
allergies, it may be dangerous for them to participate in a study);  
6. Are patients who have received an investigational medication under an FDA IND protocol within 30 days prior to the planned imaging session for this study , with 
the exception of medications allowed in the companion study and approval from sponsor. Additionally, the time between the last dose of the previous experi mental 
medication and imaging  must be at least equal to 5 times the terminal half -life of  
the previous experimental medication.  
7. Are patients with current clinically significant unstable medical comorbidities, as indicated by history or ph ysical exam that pose a potential safety risk to the 
subject.  
8. Are patients who have received a radiopharma ceutical for imaging or therapy 
within the past 24 hours prior to the imaging session for this study.  If another 
radiotracer is required in the companion protocol, patients may be able to receive 
a radiopharmaceutical for imaging or therapy within the 24 hours prior to the 
imaging session with prior sponsor approval;  
9. Are patients who, in the opinion of the investigator, are otherwise unsuitable for a study of this type. 
5.3. Prior  and Concomitant Therapy  
Except as noted below, all medications (prescription or OTC) that have been started prior 
to screening may be continued during the course of the trial.  Attempts should be made to 
keep the dosage and administration stable throughout the trial (from screening through the end of the imaging session).  Stable is generally defined as 2 weeks on therapy.  All 
medications that are continued from the start of the trial, or that are started during the trial 
05Sep2014 Amendment 1 Page 16 of 33  
 

(other than the study medication), must be documented on the Concomitant Medication 
Page of the Electronic Case Re port Form (e CRF).   
• Patients with AD may be on a stable dose of an anticholinesterase and/or Namenda, and may be taking vitamin E at the time of imaging.   
• Investigators should carefully consider whether subjects requiring 
psychotropic medications for behavioral control will be able to complete the 
imaging session and necessary procedures such as cognitive testing. 
• Subjects who are taking drugs that are known to cause QT-prolongation may 
not be enrolled in the study (a list of prohibited and discouraged medications 
is provided by the Sponsor). 
5.4. Removal of Subjects from Trial  
Subjects must be removed from the trial if:  
1. Informed consent is withdrawn; or 
2. The investigator, or the sponsor, believes it is in the best interest of the subject to 
be removed from t he trial.  
3. Subjects who are being considered for a follow up AV-1451 scan within this 
protocol must meet all inclusion/exclusion criteria at the time of the second 
imaging session.   
Subjects  may be withdrawn from the trial if a SAE  occurs. The date and reason for 
discontinuation should be noted on the eCRF. Subjects who discontinue prematurely should be seen for a final evaluation.  
5.5. 
 Premature Termination of Trial/Closure of Center  
The sponsor may discontinue the trial at any time.  Reasons for discontinuation of the 
trial may include, but are not limited to, new information on safety or efficacy, requests 
from regulatory authorities, or changes in business priorities.  Additional reasons for 
center closure may include, but are not limited to, excessive protocol violations, inadequate regard for subject safety, failure to follow recommended procedures (e.g., 
documentation), failure or inability to accommodate Avid/ Contract Research 
Organization ( CRO ) monitors or to provide required access to data and source 
documents, staff turnover or inadequate staffing, and inadequate enrollment.  Except in cases affecting subject safety, the investigator may complete final study evaluations for 
ongoing subjects. In all cases of center or study termination, appropriate steps will be 
taken to ensure the safety of study subjects. 
6. 
WARNINGS/PRECAUTIONS  
The most up- to-date and complete information regarding the use of 18F-AV-1451 
Injection can be found in the investigator's brochure.  
05Sep2014 Amendment 1 Page 17 of 33  
 

In brief, 18F-AV-1451 Injection is an experimental imaging agent that will be used at 
relatively low (tracer) doses.  However, because 18F-AV-1451 Injection is in the early 
stages of clinical investigation, it is recommended that subjects receiving 18F-AV-1451 
Injection be followed closely by means of adverse event reportin g and vital signs. 
There are no data on the effects of 18F-AV-1451 Injection in human perinatal 
development.  For this reason, females must avoid becoming pregnant.  Both females and 
males must use adequate contraceptive meth ods for 90 days after administration of 18F-
AV-1451 Injection.  18F-AV-1451 Injection must not be administered to females who are 
pregnant, or lactating.  
7. PROCEDURES AND METHO DS 
7.1.  Assessment  Periods (See Section 11.2, Trial Flow Chart)  
       
The study will consist of the following sequence of activities:  
7.1.1. Screening : 
Screening may take place over several days. All screening assessments will preferably be 
performed within 30 days prior to the PET imaging session. Some screening assessments may b e performed on the imaging day prior to injection with sponsor approval.  
Screening assessments will include:  
• Informed consent; 
• Demographics (age, gender, education, race, ethnicity); 
• Medical history, concomitant medications; 
• Disease history (date/months since symptom onset, date/months since 
diagnosis, family history of relevant neurologic disease); 
• An ECG will be performed to asse ss the subject’s cardiac status. If an ECG 
was performed  with in the last 6 months and is available for review , the ECG 
does not need to be repeated ;  
• Cognitive status interview, including MMSE and OSU TBI -ID; 
• Where appropriate, informant interview with family member or close friend 
who is familiar with subject’s everyday functioning abilities; 
• Urine  or serum  pregnancy test (women  of childbearing potential);  
• A physician will see the patient during the screening visit.  
Demographic information, cognitive status assessment, MMSE , and OSU TBI- ID 
collected within the last 60 days as part of a companion protocol or clinic visit need 
not be repeated.  
05Sep2014 Amendment 1 Page 18 of 33  
 

7.1.2. Imaging Visit   
18F-AV-1451 PET Imaging Visit  
The following assessments will be performed for all subjects: 
• Females of childbearing potential will have a urine or serum pregnancy test 
prior to injection (the result must be negative for the subject to be 
administered 18F-AV-1451);  
• Vital signs will be taken in a supine position immediately prior to 
administration of 18F-AV-1451 (within 30 minutes prior to injection)  and at  
the completion of imaging at discharge .  
• Body weight and height will be measure d prior to injection.  
• 18F-AV-1451 will be administered , a 20 minute dynamic image  will begin 
approximately 80 minutes post-injection. The images will be reconstructed 
immediate ly after the scan. With sponsor approval, sites may elect an 
alternative imaging protocol with additional time points.   All datasets will be 
submitted to the sponsor for analysis.  
• Subjects will be observed continuously for signs of adverse events, or seri ous 
adverse events;  
• A physician will see the patient prior to dosing and prior to discharge. 
7.1.3. Follow- Up: 
A follow-up phone call to the subject, or designated decision maker, will be conducted 
between 2 or 3 business days after imaging day, but not before 48 hours post-injection, to confirm subject well-being and to collect information about any new adverse events.  If 
both of these days are not business days, the follow-up phone call can occur the following 
business day. 
7.1.4. Repeat Imaging: 
Longitudinal imaging studies may be conducted under protocol 
18F-AV-1451-A14, with 
prior sponsor approval.  In these studies subjects may have up to two imaging sessions 
within a 12 month timeframe.  If the second scan is obtained more than 3 months after t he 
previous scan then the MMSE should be repeated and updates to the medical history, 
OSU- TBI and concomitant medications will be collected.  Procedures for each imaging 
day will be identical to those described above. 
7.2.  Observations and Measurements  
Informed  Consent 
 
Potential subjects  will be allowed to read a written informed consent form.  The principal 
investigator , or designee, will explain all study procedures, risks, and alternative 
therapies to subject.  The subject will have an opportunity to have all questions answered.  
The appropriate parties will then sign  and date the informed consent form, indicating 
05Sep2014 Amendment 1 Page 19 of 33  
 

their willingness to participate in the study  (see Section 7.5). A copy of the signed 
informed consent will be given to the subject.  
All informed consent forms must be approved by Avid , or designee, and by the 
appropriate I nstitutional Review Board (IRB) prior to use. 
Medical History  
The investigator, or designee, will obtain an updated history at the screening visit.  
• Relevant demographic information  
• Review of body systems 
• Social history  
• Medical and surgical history , including medical care for head trauma  
• Concurrent medications 
Whenever possible, the medical history will be confirmed by medical records. 
 
Electrocardiogram  
A resting ECG will be recorded at screening if a previous ECG performed within the last 
6 months is not available for review.  
 
MRI  
Electronic copies of historical volumetric  brain MRI scans obtained as part of the site’s 
companion protocol will be submitted to Avid , or designated imaging core lab. 
 
Vital Signs  
Vital signs (puls e rate, respiratory rate,  blood pressure) will be taken as part of the 
imaging day procedures  in the supine position prior to injection  and at the completion of 
imaging at disch arge. 
 
Height and Weight 
At the imaging visit (prior to 18F-AV-1451 dose administration ) body weight and height 
will be measured, lightly clothed.   
 
Mini- Mental State Examination (MMSE)  
The MMSE (Folstein et al., 1975) is a brief instrument used to assess cognitive function 
in elderly patients.  The instrument is divided into 2 sections.  The first section measures orientation, memory, and attention.  The maximum score for the first secti on is 21.  The 
second section tests the ability of the patient to name objects, follow verbal and written 
05Sep2014 Amendment 1 Page 20 of 33  
 

commands, write a sentence, and copy figures.  The maximum score for the second 
section is 9.  The range for the total MMSE score is 0 to 30. 
 
Ohio State University Traumatic Brain Injury Identification Method (OSU TBI -ID) 
The OSU TBI -ID (Corrigan and Bogner, 2007) short version will be used to screen for a 
history of traumatic brain injury. It is the briefest version that still provides several 
summa ry indices on which the original version was validated. To shorten the instrument, 
TBIs resulting in loss of consciousness are emphasized over less severe injuries. 
 
Physician  Visit 
A ph ysician must see the subject  at screening,  prior to drug administration and at study 
end, prior to discharge from the 18F-AV-1451 imaging session.  At discharge , the 
physician should review all safety data and briefly examine/query the subject regarding 
potential adverse events , or other treatment issues.   
 
Pregnancy Testing  
Serum beta hCG or  Urine beta hCG : performed at screening  and imaging day prior to 
injection  for females of childbearing potential (defined as pre-menopausal or less than 2 
years post- menopausal or not surgically sterile) .  
7.3.  Protocol  for Image Collection  
The sponsor will prepare and distribute i maging manual s for 18F-AV-1451 image 
acquisition parameters and transmission procedures prior to site initiation .   
7.4.  Good Clinical Practice and Monitoring  
All clinical studies performed under the direction of Avid/CRO will be conducted in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements and International Conference on 
Harmonization  (ICH) Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and Avid/CRO Standard Operating 
Procedures (SOP).  
This includes: 
1. IRB approval:  An investigation will be initiated at a study site only after the IRB 
for that study site has given their written approval of the protocol and informed 
consent;    
2. Informed Consent:  Study procedures will not be initiated until the subject signs 
the informed  consent form;   
3. Recording and monitoring of adverse events as outlined in Section 7.7.3 including 
the notification of study site clinical investigators, local IRBs and the FDA 
regarding serious adverse event; 
4. Avid RP’s obligation to monitor the participat ing center on a regular basis; and  
05Sep2014 Amendment 1 Page 21 of 33  
 

5. The termination of a center , or the trial, if conditions apply, as outlined in Section 
5.6. 
7.5.  Informed Consent and Subject Information  
Potential subjects, or their legally authorized representative (as appropriate), will b e 
allowed to read a written informed consent form.  The principal investigator, or designee, 
will explain all study procedures, risks, and alternative therapies.  The subject , and 
legally authorized representative, will have an opportunity to have all questions answered by a physician.  The subject will then sign and date the informed consent form, indicating willingness to participate in the study.  
 All informed consent forms must be approved by Avid, or designee, and by the 
appropriate Institutional Review Board (IRB).  No study related procedures shall be performed prior to completion of the informed consent process, and signing of the 
consent form.  A copy of the signed informed consent should be given to the pat ient for 
their records.  
7.6.  Documentation  
18F-AV-1451 scans will be saved in an appropriate electronic format as specified in the 
imaging manual s.  All other data required by the protocol will be recorded in the eCRFs .  
All data in the eCRF s will be substantiated by “source documents,” which consist of the 
subject’s medical files, laboratory result sheets, ECG tracings, etc.  All source 
documentation must be available to Avid, and designees.  Completed source documents 
and e CRFs may need to be made available and complete for an audit by the FDA, other 
international regulatory authorities , or Avid at any time.  eCRFs and all other records 
must be filed in accordance with applicable laws and regulations (see Section 10.6) 
7.7.  Adverse Events (AE) 
Avid’s standards for recording and reporting adverse events (AEs) are to be followed 
regardless of applicable regulatory requirements that may be less stringent.  All AEs must be fully recorded on the a dverse event e CRF s. Investigators will be instructed to report to 
Avid or its designee their assessment of the potential relatedness of each AE to study 
drug or protocol procedure via electronic data entry.  If a patient’s treatment is discontinued as a result of an AE, study site personnel must clearly report to Avid or its 
designee via electronic data entry the circumstances and data leading to any such 
discontinuation of treatment. In cases where the investigator notices an unanticipated benefit to the patient, study site personnel should report “unexpected benefit” with the 
actual event term to Avid or its designee (for example, the complete actual term would be 
“unexpected benefit - sleeping longer”).  
Laboratory test abnormalities considered by the Investigator to be clinically relevant should be reported on the a dverse event eCRF s.  Signs and symptoms of each AE should 
be described in detail (e.g., start and stop dates/time, severity/intensity, relationship to 
study drug, action taken, and outcome).  Additionally, any clinically significant findings 
from laboratory evaluations, vital sign measurements, or other study procedures  including 
those that result in a diagnosis should be reported as an AE to Avid, or its designee .  
05Sep2014 Amendment 1 Page 22 of 33  
 

7.7.1.  Adverse Event Monitoring  
Each patient must be carefully monitored for adverse events.  This includes clinical 
laboratory test variables.  An assessment must be made of the severity/intensity and 
relationship to the administration of the study drug. 
7.7.2.  Adverse Event Definitions  
 
Adve rse Events  
An adverse event is any undesirable experience occurring to a subject during a clinical trial, whether or not considered related to the study drug . 
For reporting purposes, Avid will distinguish among pre- existing conditions, trial-
emergent adver se events and treatment -emergent adverse events.   
Pre-existing conditions (i.e., undesirable experiences, signs or symptoms that begin prior 
to the Screening Visit) will be recorded on the medical history eCRF pages. During the 
study, site personnel will record any change in the condition(s) and occurrence and nature 
of any AEs.  Signs and symptoms that are believed to be due to the pre-existing condition under study (started prior to dose of study medication) do not have to be recorded in the AEs section of the eCRF, unless there is an increasing in frequency and severity.  
Trial -emergent adverse events are undesirable experiences, signs or symptoms that begin, 
or worsen in intensity or frequency, after the informed consent, and prior to administration of s tudy drug (
18F-AV-1451) at the imaging visit.   These will be recorded 
on the adverse event eCRFs .  
Treatment -emergent adverse events are undesirable experiences, signs, or symptoms 
associated with the use of a study drugs.  For the purposes of this study a n adverse event 
will be considered associated with the use of 18F-AV-1451 if it begin s or worsen s in 
intensity or frequency within 48 hours after the administration of 18F-AV-1451. Adverse 
experiences that occur after administration of study drug but outside the 48 hour 
reporting window will not be  reported  unless the investigator believes they are 
attributable to the drug.  
The end of study for the purpose of adverse event reporting is defined as 48 hours after the administration of 
18F-AV-1451 Injecti on.  
Serious Adverse Event (SAE) 
A SAE is an AE that results in one of the following outcomes or constitutes one of the following events: 
• Death;  
• Initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization (other than that required by protocol; “social hospitalization” or any hospitalization for non- medical 
reasons does not constitute a SAE); 
• A life -threatening experience (that is, immediate risk of dying);  
• Persistent or significant disability/incapacity;  
05Sep2014 Amendment 1 Page 23 of 33  
 

• Congenital anomaly/birth defect; 
• Considered significant by the investigator for any other reason. 
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospitalization may be considered serious adverse drug events when, based upon 
appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the pati ent and may require medical , 
or surgical , intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. 
Unexpected Adverse Event 
An unexpected adverse event is an adverse event not previously reported or an adverse 
event that occurs with specifici ty, severity, or frequency that is not consistent with the 
current investigator’s brochure. 
Relationship to Study Drug 
Investigators will be instructed to report their assessment of the potential relatedness of 
each adverse event to protocol procedure or s tudy drug .  The assessment of the 
relationship of an adverse event to the administration of the study drug is a clinical 
decision based on all available information at the time of the completion of the eCRF.  
Intensity/Severity of an Adverse Event 
In addition to assessing the relationship of the administration of the study drug  to adverse 
events, an assessment is required of the intensity (severity) of the event.  
The following classifications should be used: 
 
Mild:   
A mild adverse event is an adverse event, usually transient in nature and generally not 
interfering with normal activities.  
 
Moderate :   
A moderate adverse event is an adverse event that is sufficiently discomforting to 
interfere with normal activities.  
 
Severe:   
A severe adverse event is an adverse event that incapacitates the subject and prevents 
normal activities.   Note that a severe event is not necessarily a serious event.  Nor must a serious event necessarily be severe.  
7.7.3.  Adverse Event Documentation  
All adverse events must be fully recorded on the adverse event eCRFs .  Documentation 
must be supported by an entry in the subject file.  Laboratory tests, vital signs and ECG abnormalities considered by the Investigator to be clinically relevant should be reported 
on the adverse event e CRF s.  Signs and symptoms of each AE should be described in 
detail (e.g., start and stop dates, severity/intensity, relationship to study drug, action 
taken, and outcome). 
05Sep2014 Amendment 1 Page 24 of 33  
 

Adverse events and laboratory test abnormalities fulfilling the definition of a serious 
adverse event should, in addition, be reported on the Serious Adverse Event Reporting 
Form.  
7.7.4.  Reporting of Serious Adverse Events  
Study site personnel must alert Eli Lilly or its designee of any SAE within 24 hours of 
their awareness of the event v ia a sponsor-approved method.  Alerts issued via telephone 
are to be immediately followed with official notification on study -specific SAE forms.  
Serious adverse events occurring after a subject receive a dose of study drug will be 
collected until 48 hours after the  dosing of the study drug , regardless of the investigator’s 
opinion of causation.  Therefore, SAEs that occur later than 48 hours after the dosing of the study drug are not required to be reported unless the investigator feels the events were 
related to either study drug or a protocol procedure. 
If a patient experiences a SAE after signing informed consent, but prior to receiving study drug, the event will NOT be reported unless the investigator feels the event may have been caused by a protocol procedure.  Previously planned (prior to signing the ICF) 
surgeries should not be reported as SAEs unless the underlying medical condition has 
worsened during the course of the study. 
8. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  
8.1. General Statistical Considerations  
All statistical analyses will be performed using SAS® version 8.2 or higher. 
All values will be summarized by diagnostic group:  cognitively normal volunteers, 
patients with AD, patients with MCI and where relevant, other disorders as determined 
by the companion protocol .  Guidelines for diagnostic classification of cognitively 
normal volunteers, subjects with MCI and subjects with AD can be found in Appendix 
11.3.  
Frequency distributions including counts and percent ages will be included for all 
categorical outcome  varia bles.  A ll contin uous outcome variables will be summar ized 
with statistics including mean, standard deviation, median, minimum and maximum 
values .  
All data from the electronic case report forms (eCRFs) as well as any derived variables 
will be presented  by listings .  
Additional details concerning statistical analyses will be included in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) to be completed prior to the end of enrollment into the study. 
8.1.1. Populations for Analysis 
The efficacy population will include all patients for whom image data are available.   All 
analyses involving tau  imaging outcomes will be based on the efficacy population. Safety 
05Sep2014 Amendment 1 Page 25 of 33  
 

population will include all patients that received at least one dose of 18F-AV-1451 
compound. Safety evaluation will be based on safety population.  
8.2. Analyses 
8.2.1. Efficacy Analyses 
18F-AV-1451 images will be evaluated to determine if the tracer shows favorable 
characteristics for further development as a tau protein imaging agent. Descriptive 
statistics will be applied to describe th e distribution of tau deposition as measured by 18F-
AV-1451 across clinical diagnosis groups. Mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, 
and maximum values will be provided for continuous variables and counts and percentages will be provided for categorica l variables   
8.2.2. Safety Analyses 
Adverse events including injection site reactions will be summarized in terms of number and percentage of patients experiencing an AE. The AEs will be summar ized by system 
organ class (SOC) and preferred term using Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
(MedDRA) terms. Adverse events will also be presented by severity, relationship to 
treatment, and seriousness. All patients who experience SAEs, or who discontinue due to AEs, will be summarized.  
9. USE OF DATA AND PUBL ICATION 
Avid adheres to the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA)     
Principles on Conduct of Clinical Trials and Communication of Clinical Trial Results.  A      
complete copy of these principles is available from Avid and can also be found at the PhRMA website  (http://www.phrma.org
).  Our policy is briefly summarized below: 
 
• We commit to timely communication of meaningful results of controlled 
clinical trials, regardless of outcome.  
• As a sponsor, we may recommend that the Investigator(s) delay or decline publication in cases where the study design , conduct, or data are insufficient 
to allow meaningful interpretation.  Avid and the Investigator(s) will discuss 
the study design and data in advance of the study, and again after completion, 
and will strive, through appropriate scientific debate, to reach a consensus 
regarding the potential merits of publication.  
• Avid retains the right to review any manuscripts, presentations, or abstracts 
before they are submitted for publication. Where differences of opinion or interpretation exist regarding data planned for publication, the parties (Avid 
and the Investigator) should try to resolve them through appropriate scientific debate.  Avid retains the right to delay publication for up to 60 days to protect 
intellectual property.  
05Sep2014 Amendment 1 Page 26 of 33  
 

• Anyone who provides substantial contributions should receive appropriate 
recognition as an author or contributor when the manuscript is published.  
This is a multi- center study. A multi- center publication, reporting the primary analysis 
data set, should precede any other publications. 
10.   INVESTIGATOR’S REGULATORY OBLIGATIONS 
All clinical work conducted under this protocol is subject to Good Clinical Practice 
regulations; this may include an inspection by Avid and/or Health Authority representatives (FDA or international regulatory authorities) at any time.  
10.1.  Institutional Review Board (IRB)   
The intent of the research pr ogram, the trial protocol, the patient information/informed 
consent form and any advertising material used to recruit subjects must be submitted to the clinical investigator’s local IRB and its approval must be obtained prior to its use.  A 
copy of the app roval must be forwarded to Avid.  When necessary, an extension or 
renewal of IRB approval must be obtained and also forwarded to Avid. 
10.2.  Informed  Consent  
A signed, written informed consent must be obtained from each patient.  A copy of the 
signed informed consent should be given to the patient for their records.  A copy of the 
local IRB’s approved version of the informed consent form must be forwarded to Avid, 
or designee, for review prior to being used to obtain patient consent. 
10.3.  Protocol Adherence   
The protocol must be read thoroughly and the instructions must be followed exac tly.  
Where a deviation occurs, it must be documented, the sponsor/monitor informed, and a 
course of action agreed upon. 
10.4.  Documents Necess ary for Initiation of the Trial  
Avid must be provided with the following documents prior to the enrollment of any subjects:  
• Original signed and dated Statement of Agreement page; 
• Copy of the IRB and radiation safety committee approval (if applicable); 
• Copy of the IRB stamped approved consent form; 
• Name and location of the laboratory utilized for laboratory assays, and other 
facilities conducting tests, including laboratory certification number and date 
of certification if available.  Avid may be responsible for supplying these to 
the investigator if  a central laboratory is used;  
• List of reference range laboratory values.  Avid may be responsible for this if 
a central laboratory is used; and  
05Sep2014 Amendment 1 Page 27 of 33  
 

• Any additional licenses required in order to order to use 18F-AV-1451. 
10.5. Study Drug  Control  
The receipt of clinical supplies must be documented at the site .   
All drug supplies for this trial should be retained in a safe and secure place at all times 
during the trial.   18F-AV-1451 Injection should be prepared by a qualified PET 
manufacturing site  and administered by a qualified individual under the investigator’s 
supervision.  All drug supplies must be accounted for.  After completion of the trial, all remaining clinical supplies must be returned to the sponsor or their representative.   
10.6. Data Coll ection  
Electronic case report forms (eCRFs) will be used for this trial.  Individual patient files should include appropriate source documents, including but not limited to patient’s medical records and laboratory test results.  The files should include information such as 
visit dates, records of medical history, examinations administered, laboratory, 
concomitant treatment, any adverse event encountered and other notes as appropriate.  These constitute “source data”.  All entries on the eCRFs must be backed  up by source 
data.  Original electronic versions of imaging studies are also considered source data and should be kept on file by the site /imaging center , and appropriate copies should be 
forwarded to Avid , or a designated Imaging  Core Lab , as specified i n the Imaging 
Manual.   
Each patient’s source file should include an original signed informed consent form.  
When the trial is completed, the informed consent form should be kept on file with other 
trial related records.  
All original laboratory reports mus t be available for review in each patient’s file.  It is 
important that the original reports be available for review because of the possibility of inaccuracies or errors in transcribing data from original records to the eCRF.  
The eCRFs must be kept in order and up- to-date so that they always reflect the latest 
observations on the subjects that are enrolled in the trial.  The eCRFs must be completed for each patient enrolled in the trial and signed by the investigator.  This should be done 
as soon as possibl e after completion of the patient’s participation in the trial.  A monitor 
will verify the source data f or all information on the eCRF. 
10.7. Adverse Events  
All adverse events encountered during the clinical trial must be documented on the e CRF, 
whether or not considered drug- related.  
Eli Lilly must be notified immediately (as soon as possible, and in all cases within 24 hours) of a drug experience, condition, development, or event, which is considered 
serious. Eli Lilly must be notified immediately of any findin gs with the use of the drug 
that may suggest significant hazards, contraindications, adverse drug reactions (ADRs) 
and precautions pertinent to the safety of the drug.  The investigator will be requested to 
05Sep2014 Amendment 1 Page 28 of 33  
 

complete a separate report form in addition to th e information on the e CRF.  See section 
7.7.4 for r eporting serious adverse events . 
If a SAE is determined to be unexpected (not previously reported or described by Avid), 
and study drug- related, Eli Lilly will notify the investigator in writing.  The investigator 
should forward this notification to the IRB within 24 hours of receipt. 
10.8. Records Retention  
All co rrespondence (e.g., with Avid, IRB, etc.) relating to this clinical trial should be kept 
in appropriate file folders.  Records of subjects, source documents, and drug inventory sheets pertaining to the trial must be kept on file.  Records must be retained until the date 
a marketing application (NDA) is approved for the drug for the indication for which it is 
being investigated, or until 2 years following the date of clinical trial termination or completion, whichever is later.   If no application is to be filed or if the application is not 
approved for such indication, records should be kept until 2 years following the date of 
clinical trial termination , or completion. 
If an investigator moves, withdraws from an investigation, or retires, the responsibility 
for maintaining the records may be transferred to another person who will accept the 
responsibility.  Notice of transfer must be made to and agreed up on by Avid.

11.3. Guidelines for diagnostic classification  
Subject s meeting the NINCDS -ADRDA criteria (McKhann 2011) should be classified as 
possi ble or probable AD : 
1. Patients with dementia as evidenced by a MMSE score typically  ranging from 10 
to 24, boundaries included, at screening; 
2. Patients whose history of cognitive decline has been gradual in onset and 
progressive over months to years . Evidence should be present indicating sustained 
memory deterioration in an otherwise cognitively normal patient, plus additional 
cognitive deficits in another cognitive function such as: learning, language 
presentation, visuospatial presentation, and executive dysfunction.  
Subjects who meet the following  NIA -Alzheime r’s Association working group’s 
diagnostic guidelines for AD: Alzheimer’s Dementia 7:270 -9, 2011 (Albert 2011),   
criteria should be classified as mild cognitive impairment:  
1. Have cognitive decline verified by the study physician.  
2.  Evidence of objective impairment in one or more cognitive domains, with 
supporting evidence from objective testing if availab le.  
3. Preservation of independence in functional abilities . 
4. Not demented .  
5. Patients  typically  with an MMSE score ≥ 24. 
Subjects who meet the following criteria should be classified as cognitively normal 
volunteers:  
1. Subjects with an MMSE score > 29, and are cognitively normal based on history 
(no evidence of significant recent cognitive decline) and psychometric test battery 
at screening;  
Note:   Subjects with dementia who do not meet criteria for probable AD, as described in 
point number 1, should be classified as ‘other dementing disorders’.
